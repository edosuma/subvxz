WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.909
Walter:
DAMN IT, YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.580
LISTEN TO ME!

00:12.680 --> 00:15.316
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REPORT.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.485
WE'RE GONNA ISSUE
THE RECALL.

00:17.585 --> 00:21.589
ALL OF IT!
ALL RIGHT, JACE, FINE.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.659
YEAH, YOU THINK
YOU NEED TO PROTECT
YOUR ASS, THAT'S FINE.

00:25.759 --> 00:29.530
JUST CALL THE DONALDSONS
AND TELL THEM IT WAS
MY CALL, ALL RIGHT?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.734
JESUS.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.370
( theme music playing )

00:53.053 --> 00:55.623
MARIE, IS HE OFF?

00:55.723 --> 00:58.326
ALL RIGHT, GET ME BURT.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.229
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.
BAD ENOUGH I'M LATE, BUT--

01:01.329 --> 01:04.265
UH, BURT?
YEAH, WALTER.

01:04.365 --> 01:07.034
UM, LISTEN, I'M SORRY

01:07.135 --> 01:10.771
BUT THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME USE MY PHONE
UNTIL I CLEARED CUSTOMS.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.841
UH, I CAN'T REACH
THE DONALDSONS.

01:13.941 --> 01:17.111
NO, BUT WE'RE
GONNA GO AHEAD
WITH THE RECALL ANYWAY.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.013
I DON'T TRUST JACE
ON THIS.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.250
NO, OR ON ANYTHING ELSE
REALLY.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.219
WELL, OKAY.
GOOD GOOD, ALL RIGHT.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.689
MARIE'LL SET UP
A MEETING AT...

01:28.789 --> 01:30.090
10:00 P.M.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.361
OKAY.
UH, MARIE, DID YOU GET
THAT LAST PART?

01:33.461 --> 01:36.664
GOOD.
OKAY, CALL JACE LAST.

01:36.764 --> 01:40.901
ORDER FOOD.
ANY PRESS, TELL THEM THAT
WE'RE WORKING ON A STATEMENT.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.070
NO, GIVE ME 40 MINUTES.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.974
NO CALLS, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.942
THANKS.
OH, WHAT?

01:49.042 --> 01:52.146
YEAH, I'LL TEXT CONNIE.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.749
OH, JESUS.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.988
- DO YOU NEED A MOMENT, WALTER?
- UH? OH...

02:01.088 --> 02:03.491
UH, CONNIE.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.462
I'M NOT GONE THREE DAYS
AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.433
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S
AN EMERGENCY, WE CAN...

02:12.533 --> 02:15.436
- WE CAN RESCHEDULE.
- WE'VE ALREADY RESCHEDULED.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.839
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE AT 6:00.
IT'S 8:00.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.941
NO, IT'S AFTER 8:00.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.177
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I--

02:23.277 --> 02:25.446
AND I APPRECIATE
YOUR SEEING ME LATER.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.648
I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE
A LIFE OUTSIDE OF HERE.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.950
NO, IT'S FINE.
I HAD AN HOUR FREE.

02:30.050 --> 02:34.054
IF YOU UNDERSTOOD--
IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTOOD
HOW LOATH I AM TO BE LATE.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.624
I'M REALLY SORRY.
THIS ISN'T ME AT ALL.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.359
REALLY, IT'S FINE.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.794
- HERE.
- WHAT'S THIS?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.231
UH, IT'S--
IT'S FOR YOUR TIME.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.533
YOU'RE PAYING
FOR THE SESSION
IN CASH?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.436
NO, IT'S NOT FOR THE SESSION.
I'LL WRITE A CHECK FOR THAT.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.439
THIS IS... THIS IS JUST
SOMETHING EXTRA FOR YOU.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.608
THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY, WALTER.
THANK YOU.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.678
OH, WELL,

02:57.778 --> 03:00.714
SOMEONE...

03:00.814 --> 03:02.250
UNIMPEACHABLE, HUH?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.418
- I LIKE THAT.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.854
WELL, I WASN'T
TRYING TO BRIBE YOU.
I MEAN, I'M--

03:06.954 --> 03:08.656
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I OPERATE.

03:08.756 --> 03:12.626
ALTHOUGH, I TELL YOU,
SOMETIMES IT MIGHT BE EASIER
FOR ME IF I DID.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.663
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE UP FOR LOST HOURS.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.598
- I UNDERSTAND.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.569
I-- I KNOW YOU VALUE
YOUR TIME AND I'VE WASTED
SOME OF IT.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.704
IT WAS GENEROUS OF YOU TO OFFER.
THANK YOU, WALTER.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.407
- BUT I--
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.542
YOU'RE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.779
THAT'S A RARE THING
THESE DAYS,

03:31.879 --> 03:33.681
SOMEONE WHO'S DEPENDABLE.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.317
I HAD TO COME TO A WALK-UP
IN BROOKLYN TO FIND IT, BUT--

03:36.417 --> 03:38.852
- ( phone rings )
- OH, GOD.

03:38.952 --> 03:43.257
MARIE, I SAID NO CALLS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!

03:43.357 --> 03:46.360
CAN'T--
ARE YOU SURE?

03:47.795 --> 03:50.531
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

03:50.631 --> 03:54.268
NO NO.
NO, DON'T LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU'VE REACHED ME.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.371
JUST LET HIM THINK
I'M WALKING INTO IT.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.273
I'LL CALL YOU FROM THE CAR.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.876
JUST GIVE ME
A HALF HOUR OF PEACE.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.513
CAN YOU DO THAT?
THANKS.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.717
UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS LITTLE PISSER--

04:09.817 --> 04:11.552
JACE!

04:11.652 --> 04:14.187
HE'S NOT EVEN HALF MY AGE
AND SOMEHOW HE THINKS

04:14.288 --> 04:16.424
HE'S GONNA USE THIS
TO BRING ME DOWN.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.092
HE'S SO SELF-DELUDED
HE ACTUALLY THINKS

04:19.192 --> 04:21.261
THEY'RE GONNA
GIVE HIM MY JOB.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.697
- WALTER, YOU SEEM--
- IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.433
IN A WAY.
I MEAN,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.768
HE WAS VERY BRIGHT, EAGER,

04:27.868 --> 04:31.405
GOOD SCHOOLS. I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THE COMPANY.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.675
BUT HE'S GREEN.
HE'S IN OVER HIS HEAD.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.978
- IT'S-- ( groans )
- WALTER, CAN YOU LISTEN
TO ME FOR A MOMENT?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.815
YOU SEEMS LIKE--

04:41.915 --> 04:45.419
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE MIDST
OF A BREAKING CRISIS HERE.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.322
NO, PAUL, IT'S NOT BREAKING.
IT'S ALREADY BROKE.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.792
WE CULL INGREDIENTS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD:

04:53.060 --> 04:56.330
CHINA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.232
SOMEHOW SOMETHING GOT
INTO THE PIPELINE.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.536
WALTER, WHATEVER
IS GOING ON--

05:02.636 --> 05:05.806
IT COULD BE CONTAMINATED
MILK POWDER OR BACTERIA

05:05.906 --> 05:09.443
FROM ONE OF THE FACTORIES.
IT COULD BE A CHEAP LUBRICANT

05:09.543 --> 05:12.079
- LEECHING INTO
THE MACHINERY--
- WALTER.

05:12.179 --> 05:15.749
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE ABLE TO GET AWAY
FROM THIS RIGHT NOW.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.019
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE
A VERY GOOD IDEA FOR US
TO RESCHEDULE.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.321
RESCHEDULE?!
WHEN?

05:21.422 --> 05:24.792
IT'S NOT GONNA GET
ANY BETTER TOMORROW

05:24.892 --> 05:26.527
OR THE DAY AFTER.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.563
I-- PAUL, I'M GOING
INTO COMBAT IN AN HOUR.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.501
AND IF I-- IF I--
IF I DON'T TALK TO YOU NOW,

05:33.601 --> 05:36.103
IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER MONTH
BEFORE I GET A CHANCE.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.072
( phone ringing )

05:44.077 --> 05:46.514
IT'S OFF, OKAY?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.585
BOTH OF THEM, OKAY?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.853
OKAY.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.389
- UH, CAN I GET
A GLASS OF WATER?
- SURE.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.563
OH, I HATE THIS STUFF.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.533
CONNIE'S ALWAYS TELLING ME
I SHOULD DRINK MORE OF IT.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.905
SO DOES MY DOCTOR,
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR IT.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.141
YOU-- YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

06:14.241 --> 06:16.143
TO DRINK WATER?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.211
SOMETIMES NO, I DON'T.
AND THIS WEEK,

06:18.311 --> 06:20.113
IT'S A GOOD THING ANYWAY,
WHERE I WAS.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.115
YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELING?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.251
HUH.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.988
I SPENT THE LAST 44
OUT OF 72 HOURS

06:28.088 --> 06:29.957
IN AN AIRPLANE.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.793
AND THE HOURS WAITING

06:32.893 --> 06:36.363
FOR THE SIX FLIGHTS WERE
NO BARREL OF LAUGHS EITHER.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.132
SO THE TRIP WAS
IN RESPONSE TO THE...

06:39.232 --> 06:41.935
- TO THE CRISIS.
- WHAT?

06:42.035 --> 06:45.506
WELL, YOU WERE JUST SAYING
HOW YOU HAVE SUPPLIERS
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

06:45.606 --> 06:48.676
AND I ASSUMED THAT YOU WERE

06:48.776 --> 06:51.311
TRYING TO TRACK DOWN
THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.547
OH, NO NO.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.717
UH, I WASN'T FLYING
FOR THE COMPANY.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.521
- YOU WEREN'T?
- NO, I FLEW TO RWANDA
TO GET NATALIE.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.559
NATALIE.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.196
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?
- NO, SHE DIDN'T SAY SO.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.633
BUT I KNEW THAT
SHE WAS IN TROUBLE.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.606
SO SHE DIDN'T
ASK YOU TO COME?

07:18.706 --> 07:21.542
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
LOOK, PAUL, SHE'S--

07:21.642 --> 07:24.411
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.
AND UNTIL SHE WENT
TO RWANDA,

07:24.512 --> 07:27.280
I HAD SPOKEN WITH HER
EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.151
WHEREVER
I WAS IN THE WORLD,
I'D CALL HER AT BEDTIME

07:31.251 --> 07:32.520
AND TELL HER I LOVED HER.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.855
BEFORE SHE COULD TALK,

07:34.955 --> 07:38.592
I MADE THESE LITTLE
CLICKING NOISES.

07:38.692 --> 07:42.563
THEN AFTER
SHE WENT TO RWANDA,
WE EMAILED EVERY DAY.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.398
SUDDENLY A WEEK AGO,

07:45.499 --> 07:48.736
SHE WRITES HER MOTHER

07:48.836 --> 07:50.771
BUT NOT ME.

07:50.871 --> 07:55.676
CONNIE DOESN'T DO EMAIL
SO I HAD TO PRINT
THE LETTERS OUT FOR HER.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.179
AND SHE WAS ASKING CONNIE
IF I WAS ALL RIGHT,

07:59.279 --> 08:01.749
IF THE COMPANY WAS

08:01.849 --> 08:04.585
REALLY COMPLICIT IN
THIS BABY FORMULA MESS.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.754
IT WAS--
IT WAS CRAZY TALK.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.157
MIGHTN'T SHE HAVE JUST BEEN
CONCERNED FOR YOUR WELFARE?

08:10.257 --> 08:13.326
WELL, PAUL, DON'T YOU THINK
I KNOW MY OWN DAUGHTER?

08:13.426 --> 08:15.663
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING, WALTER.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.869
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY, WITH YOUR COMPANY
IN CRISIS,

08:21.969 --> 08:25.072
YOU WOULD CHOSE TO VISIT
YOUR DAUGHTER IN RWANDA.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.508
THE EMAILS, HER VOICE

08:28.609 --> 08:30.210
WASN'T HER VOICE.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.445
SHE WOULD NEVER
DOUBT HER FATHER.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.683
NOW I'M NOT SAYING
SHE'S BEING BRAINWASHED,

08:35.783 --> 08:38.518
BUT I KNEW SHE WAS
HIDING SOMETHING

08:38.619 --> 08:41.088
AND ONCE I GOT THERE
I FOUND OUT I WAS RIGHT.

08:41.188 --> 08:45.258
- WHAT WAS SHE HIDING?
- TO START WITH, SHE CUT
ALL HER HAIR OFF.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.928
SHE'D ALWAYS HAD
THIS LONG AUBURN HAIR,

08:48.028 --> 08:50.197
LIKE MY MOTHER'S
WHEN SHE WAS THAT AGE.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.533
WELL, THAT'S GONE NOW.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.370
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S DISTURBING?

08:57.470 --> 08:59.840
I CAN SEE WHY YOU MIGHT
FIND IT SO, YES.

09:01.441 --> 09:05.145
BUT CUTTING HAIR,
DYEING IT WEIRD COLORS,

09:05.245 --> 09:08.215
( laughs )
LOPPING IT OFF EVEN,

09:08.315 --> 09:10.818
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
DAUGHTERS DO.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.987
WHAT ELSE WAS
DIFFERENT ABOUT HER?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.658
OH, WHAT WAS
THE SAME ABOUT HER?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.060
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO
I WAS TALKING TO.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.497
SHE HAD NO SHOES.
SHE HAD GIVEN THEM AWAY,
IT TURNS OUT.

09:24.598 --> 09:28.068
SHE WAS SO THIN.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.405
SHE HAD THIS CHILD
IN HER ARMS--

09:32.505 --> 09:36.677
A LITTLE GIRL
HANGING IN HER ARMS
LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.347
ARE YOU OKAY, WALTER?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.984
THIS IS WHERE
SHE'S LIVING, PAUL.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.319
THIS IS WHERE MY DAUGHTER
HAS CHOSEN TO LIVE--

09:46.419 --> 09:48.521
SOME HELLHOLE NEAR GOMA.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.359
WHEN SHE SAW YOU,
HOW DID SHE REACT?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.194
I DON'T THINK I SPOKE
RIGHT AWAY.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.429
I JUST STOOD THERE

09:56.529 --> 09:57.898
LOOKING AT HER.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.533
FINALLY
SHE GOT SCARED.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.370
SHE SAID, "WHAT IS IT?
MOM? IS MOM ALL RIGHT?"

10:03.470 --> 10:05.038
AND I SAID, "NO,
YOUR MOTHER'S FINE."

10:05.138 --> 10:07.507
SHE SAID, "THEN WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?"
AND I SAID,

10:07.607 --> 10:09.843
"I'VE COME
TO TAKE YOU HOME.
GET YOUR STUFF."

10:09.943 --> 10:13.446
- AND THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN WELL?
- NO. AT FIRST SHE WAS--

10:13.546 --> 10:17.651
DISTANT.
"DAD, I CAN'T LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.353
I HAVE TO FINISH
A PROCEDURE."

10:20.453 --> 10:23.290
AS IF SHE'D GOT
SOME MEDICAL DEGREE
IN THE LAST MONTH.

10:23.390 --> 10:27.327
SHE SAID SHE'D MEET ME
FOR DINNER IN A FEW HOURS
IN THE BIG TENT.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.998
THEN SHE POINTED
IN THE DIRECTION
OF SOME LITTLE SHACKS

10:31.098 --> 10:33.533
IN CASE
I WANTED TO LIE DOWN.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.903
SHE WAS LIVING IN ONE
OF THOSE SHACKS.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.439
THEY LOOKED LIKE OUTHOUSES
AND SHE WAS SLEEPING THERE.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.842
I CAN SEE HOW
UPSETTING THAT...

10:41.942 --> 10:44.712
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
FOR YOU.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.414
I MEAN, YOU SPENT
YOUR LIFE

10:47.514 --> 10:50.083
PROVIDING
A GOOD HOME FOR HER

10:50.183 --> 10:53.253
AND THIS IS HOW SHE
CHOOSES TO LIVE.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.988
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE DINNER?

10:55.088 --> 10:58.291
WELL, I DIDN'T
WAIT FOR DINNER.
I WENT BACK INTO THE SHACK

10:58.391 --> 11:02.095
AND I TOOK ALL HER STUFF
AND I PUT IT IN THE JEEP.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.932
I JUST...

11:05.032 --> 11:07.701
I JUST WANTED
TO TAKE IT BACK WITH ME

11:07.801 --> 11:11.204
TO KIGALI AND AT LEAST
HAVE HER CLOTHES CLEANED.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.709
I WANTED TO GO BACK
TO THE HOTEL THAT NIGHT

11:15.809 --> 11:17.177
AND TAKE HER TO DINNER

11:17.277 --> 11:19.179
AND MAYBE TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HER.

11:19.279 --> 11:23.483
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE'S TEARING ACROSS
THIS FIELD,

11:23.583 --> 11:26.386
SCREAMING AT ME--
INSANE STUFF--

11:26.486 --> 11:28.355
HOW I'M TRYING
TO CONTROL HER,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.390
HOW I DON'T RESPECT HER,

11:30.490 --> 11:33.827
HOW SHE'S WORKED SO HARD
TO BUILD UP TRUST
WITH THESE PEOPLE

11:33.927 --> 11:36.163
AND NOW THEY'RE
GONNA THINK THAT

11:36.263 --> 11:39.767
SHE'S SOME
NEOCOLONIALIST LIKE ME.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.403
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT CONNIE I'M NOT EVEN
GOING TO REPEAT.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.407
I SWEAR TO GOD, PAUL,
IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD
NOT TO SLAP HER.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.042
INSTEAD I JUST SAID,
"DON'T YOU EVER

11:49.142 --> 11:51.411
SPEAK ABOUT YOUR
MOTHER LIKE THAT."

11:52.712 --> 11:55.916
THEN SHE BROKE DOWN
AND STARTED TO CRY.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.718
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

11:58.819 --> 12:02.255
I PUT MY ARMS
AROUND HER.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.758
I SAID, "NATALIE,
WE'RE GOING HOME."

12:04.858 --> 12:07.127
AND THEN...

12:09.162 --> 12:12.332
SHE TOLD ME
TO GO FUCK MYSELF.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.871
SHE'D NEVER SAID ANYTHING
LIKE THAT TO YOU BEFORE?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.977
SHE BROKE MY HEART, PAUL.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.881
SHE BROKE MY HEART.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.625
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE WAS SO ANGRY WITH YOU?

12:38.725 --> 12:42.129
OH, SHE MADE THAT
PRETTY CLEAR.

12:42.229 --> 12:46.333
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM HER
WHEN I GOT BACK
TO THE HOTEL.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.239
IT TURNS OUT THAT I'M
DOMINEERING, OBSESSIVE,

12:52.339 --> 12:55.075
THAT I'M THE CAUSE
OF ALL HER ANXIETIES,

12:55.175 --> 12:58.545
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO THRIVE OR GROW AROUND ME,

12:58.645 --> 13:01.781
AND THAT'S WHY SHE HAD
TO GO AWAY

13:01.882 --> 13:04.217
AND NOW I'M RUINING

13:04.317 --> 13:06.954
HER ONLY CHANCE TO FREE
HERSELF FROM ME.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.824
NOW YOU SEE WHY
I WENT OVER THERE?

13:10.924 --> 13:14.027
I SENSED THIS WAS COMING
FROM EARLIER EMAILS.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.365
HMMM.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.467
YOU KNOW, HEARING THAT
EMAIL MAKES ME...

13:22.602 --> 13:24.504
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE WAY YOU

13:24.604 --> 13:26.373
CAME IN HERE TODAY?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.777
COMPLETELY IN CHARGE
ON BOTH PHONES,

13:30.878 --> 13:33.446
HANDING ME YOUR BAG--

13:33.546 --> 13:35.949
NOT QUITE LIKE
I WAS A BELLHOP,

13:36.049 --> 13:38.151
BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.089
- I'M SORRY IF I OFFENDED YOU.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T OFFEND ME.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.524
BUT IT DID CATCH
MY ATTENTION.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.694
WALTER, WE BOTH KNOW

13:47.794 --> 13:49.829
THAT YOU ARE

13:49.930 --> 13:51.999
AN EXCELLENT MANAGER.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.502
WORLD CLASS, RIGHT?

13:55.602 --> 14:00.640
BUT IN OTHER ROLES WHERE
YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY IN CONTROL,

14:00.740 --> 14:02.342
LIKE SAY BEING A PATIENT HERE,

14:02.442 --> 14:06.046
OR MAYBE WHEN YOU WENT
TO SEE NATALIE...

14:07.747 --> 14:09.950
THAT'S MUCH LESS
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

14:10.050 --> 14:13.453
BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I NEVER TRY TO CONTROL NATALIE.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.956
- I GAVE HER
WHATEVER SHE WANTED.
- OF COURSE.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.626
YOU'VE GIVEN HER EVERYTHING.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.561
AND THAT'S...

14:21.661 --> 14:23.964
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HARD
FOR OTHER PARENTS TO DO.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.899
BUT NOT FOR YOU.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.401
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

14:28.501 --> 14:31.071
WHAT'S HARD FOR YOU IS

14:31.171 --> 14:34.441
JUST LETTING HER BE?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.110
LETTING HER GO?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.379
DID YOU THINK THAT
YOU FELT HER

14:39.479 --> 14:42.315
PULLING AWAY FROM YOU
IN THOSE EMAILS?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.919
AND THEN WHEN YOU SAW HER
AT THE CAMP

14:46.019 --> 14:48.555
DID YOU GET FRIGHTENED?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.690
SCARED OF LOSING HER

14:50.790 --> 14:54.061
SO THAT YOU FELT YOU
HAD TO TELL HER TO PACK UP
HER THINGS AND COME HOME?

14:54.161 --> 14:57.530
OH, JESUS.
CAN'T A FATHER WORRY
ABOUT HIS OWN DAUGHTER?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.899
OF COURSE HE CAN.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.503
BUT JUST LOOK AT HOW YOU
RESPONDED FOR A MOMENT.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.641
IN THE MIDST OF A MAJOR
WORK CRISIS, YOU READ AN EMAIL

15:08.741 --> 15:11.578
THAT SHE WROTE TO CONNIE
AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK,

15:11.678 --> 15:15.115
YOU GET ON A PLANE AND YOU
FLY HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.684
WALTER?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.652
AH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.855
THESE WORK
PRETTY QUICK.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.725
XANAX, IT'S...

15:25.825 --> 15:28.795
DR. WELLS GAVE ME
THE PRESCRIPTION.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.131
THANK GOD HE DID.

15:32.832 --> 15:37.004
OTHERWISE I'D NEVER
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET
OUT OF THAT PLACE.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.444
( sighs in relief )

15:56.923 --> 15:58.992
DID YOU TAKE A PILL

15:59.092 --> 16:00.593
AFTER YOU SAW NATALIE?

16:00.693 --> 16:04.297
NO. LATER.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.466
I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

16:06.566 --> 16:08.435
IN A COLD SWEAT.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.203
I HAD A NIGHTMARE...

16:11.171 --> 16:13.540
THAT NATALIE WAS GONE.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.278
THEN I LOOKED AROUND ME
AND WITH THE JETLAG

16:18.378 --> 16:21.581
AND THE FATIGUE, I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE I WAS FOR A MINUTE.

16:21.681 --> 16:25.085
I THOUGHT I WAS BACK
IN MY PARENTS' HOUSE,

16:25.185 --> 16:26.986
IN TOMMY'S ROOM

16:27.087 --> 16:30.757
WITH ALL HIS SPORTS TROPHIES
AND AWARDS.

16:30.857 --> 16:34.594
I-- I JUST COULDN'T STAY
IN THAT ROOM ANOTHER SECOND.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.730
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.
I WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.700
AND THEN
I REMEMBERED THE PILLS.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.137
DO YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE
THAT YOU WERE...

16:44.237 --> 16:47.074
THAT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT

16:47.174 --> 16:50.243
TOMMY OVER THERE
IN AFRICA?

16:52.479 --> 16:54.981
HE'S BEEN
ON MY MIND LATELY.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.617
AND DO YOU KNOW WHEN
THAT STARTED?

16:59.819 --> 17:02.322
HAS IT BEEN
SINCE NATALIE LEFT?

17:04.424 --> 17:06.893
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOKE UP
AND YOU FELT THAT YOU--

17:06.993 --> 17:08.528
YOU HAD TO GET OUT.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.199
( sighs )
HOTELS CAN BE DISORIENTING.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.367
BUT LOSING TOMMY WAS

17:14.467 --> 17:16.169
VERY PAINFUL FOR YOU,
WASN'T IT?

17:16.269 --> 17:18.971
MY FOLKS HAD THE PAIN.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.709
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
WHEN PARENTS LOSE A CHILD
IT KILLS THEM.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.182
IT'S REALLY ADMIRABLE THAT
YOU REMAINED SO CLOSE

17:29.282 --> 17:31.984
TO YOUR PARENTS
AFTER THAT HAPPENED.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.554
LIKE WITH THE DONALDSONS,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.089
AS YOU'VE SAID.

17:36.189 --> 17:40.227
AFTER THEIR SON JAMES
DIED,

17:40.327 --> 17:43.563
YOU BECAME
LIKE A SON TO THEM--

17:43.663 --> 17:45.865
THE GOOD SON,

17:45.965 --> 17:48.501
THE ONE EVERYBODY
CAN DEPEND ON.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.239
AND THEN YOU HAD
THIS DREAM.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.675
YOU FEEL THAT
YOU'RE SUFFOCATING

17:55.775 --> 17:57.344
IN TOMMY'S ROOM.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.847
WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO

18:00.947 --> 18:02.382
WITH NATALIE?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.951
MAYBE NATALIE IS TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING

18:05.051 --> 18:08.855
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
ALLOWED YOURSELF TO DO:

18:08.955 --> 18:12.058
TO SEPARATE
FROM HER PARENTS.

18:12.159 --> 18:15.061
FOR YOU TO STAY CONNECTED
MEANS TO NEVER

18:15.162 --> 18:17.164
STRAY.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.066
NOW NATALIE IS TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING IN BETWEEN,

18:20.167 --> 18:22.835
BUT YOU FEEL THAT
SHE'S ABANDONING YOU

18:22.935 --> 18:25.638
THE WAY TOMMY DID.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.875
HE DIED, PAUL.
JESUS.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.811
- HE DIDN'T ABANDON ME.
- I KNOW.

18:31.911 --> 18:35.215
BUT MAYBE
THAT NIGHT IN THE HOTEL,
NATALIE'S SEPARATION

18:35.315 --> 18:38.084
FROM YOU FELT,

18:38.185 --> 18:40.920
IN SOME WAY,

18:41.020 --> 18:43.022
IT FELT LIKE A DEATH.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.292
GOD FORBID.
NO!

18:45.392 --> 18:47.760
THERE'S NO
COMPARISON, YEAH.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.363
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.766
WHEN A CHILD DIES,
HE'S GONE.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.103
ISN'T THAT EXACTLY
THE NIGHTMARE THAT WOKE YOU UP--
THAT NATALIE WAS GONE?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.339
NO, IT WASN'T
THE SAME.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.309
I WAS TRYING TO FIND HER.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.845
I KNEW THAT NO MATTER
HOW BAD I FELT,

19:05.945 --> 19:11.284
I HAD TO PUT MYSELF ASIDE
AND THINK ONLY OF NATALIE.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.487
I TOOK THE PILLS.
SOMEHOW IT PASSED.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.391
AND I DRAGGED MYSELF
BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY

19:18.491 --> 19:20.893
AND I WENT ONLINE
IN THE BUSINESS CENTER.

19:20.993 --> 19:25.332
THAT'S WHEN
I READ HER EMAILS
AND I REALIZED...

19:26.266 --> 19:27.934
( sighs )

19:28.034 --> 19:29.636
I REALIZED--

19:29.736 --> 19:31.704
YOU REALIZED WHAT, WALTER?
IT-IT-IT'S--

19:31.804 --> 19:35.174
IT'S OKAY
TO HAVE THE THOUGHT HERE.
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.312
I REALIZED THAT
SHE DIDN'T NEED ME AT ALL.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.282
OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST WHAT SHE
NEEDS TO FEEL RIGHT NOW.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.751
NO, SHE'S DONE
WITH HER OLD MAN.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.221
- I'M A BOOSTER ROCKET.
- OH, SHE'S LAUNCHED,
LIKE YOUR BOYS,

19:48.321 --> 19:50.623
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID
AT OUR FIRST SESSION?

19:50.723 --> 19:53.159
DID I?
I'M SURE I ALSO SAID
THAT NATALIE WAS DIFFERENT.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.395
WELL, I'D HAVE
TO AGREE WITH YOU.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.797
YOU DID RAISE HER
WITH THE FREEDOM
TO THINK FOR HERSELF,

19:57.897 --> 20:01.234
TO QUESTION AUTHORITY FIGURES,
TO CONFRONT THE WORLD
OF ADULTS.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.271
YOU GAVE HER
AN INCREDIBLE GIFT.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.672
NOW SHE WANTS TO USE IT.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.374
BY TELLING ME
TO GO FUCK MYSELF?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.476
THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD.
BUT BEFORE THAT,

20:09.576 --> 20:11.878
SHE WANTED YOU TO TALK THINGS
OVER WITH HER.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.714
- SHE INVITED YOU TO DINNER, NO?
- SHE WAS JUST SHINING ME ON.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.818
POSSIBLY.
OR POSSIBLY SHE REALLY
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.321
BUT YOU FELT LIKE SHE WAS
DISRESPECTING YOU

20:21.421 --> 20:23.323
AND YOU REACTED TO THAT.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.392
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT

20:25.492 --> 20:28.127
FOR HER WHOLE LIFE SHE'S
BEEN VERY AWARE OF YOU

20:28.227 --> 20:30.363
AND HOW YOU FEEL
AND WHAT YOU THINK

20:30.463 --> 20:32.465
AND WHAT SHE CAN DO
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.335
MAYBE PART OF THE REASON
SHE'S SO ANGRY IS BECAUSE

20:35.435 --> 20:37.737
MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HER LIFE SHE KNOWS THAT

20:37.837 --> 20:40.740
WHAT SHE WANTS IS NOT
WHAT YOU WANT.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.211
AND SHE'S HAVING A VERY
HARD TIME RECONCILING
HERSELF TO THAT FACT.

20:45.312 --> 20:48.348
SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME?
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.650
SO HOW DID YOU
LEAVE THINGS WITH HER?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.453
I DIDN'T.
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING

20:53.553 --> 20:56.088
TO A BARRAGE
OF INCOMING FAXES,
PHONE CALLS,

20:56.188 --> 20:58.925
EMAILS, OUTBREAKS
OF DIARRHEA,

20:59.025 --> 21:02.429
CHILDREN IN HOSPITALS
POSSIBLY FROM FORMULA

21:02.529 --> 21:04.964
CONTAMINATED AT ONE
OF OUR PLANTS.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.834
I'D GOTTEN OUT
IN FRONT OF THIS!

21:07.934 --> 21:10.937
I LEAVE FOR A FEW DAYS AND--

21:11.037 --> 21:13.940
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR ME TO TURN MY BACK.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.109
( phone rings )

21:17.209 --> 21:19.178
( sighs )

21:19.278 --> 21:21.481
I'M-- I'M--
I'M SORRY, WALTER.

21:21.581 --> 21:26.218
WITH THE LATE SESSION,
I FORGOT TO SHUT THE--

21:26.319 --> 21:30.390
- ( answering machine beeps )
- Hello, this is Mr. Barnett's
assistant Marie.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.392
It's urgent
that he speaks with Burt.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.894
If he calls me,
I can patch him through.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.331
- ( beeps )
- BACK TO BATTLE STATIONS.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.968
I'D BETTER BE GOING.
UH, THANK YOU, PAUL.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.238
SHEESH-- 26 MESSAGES.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.508
- WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT?
- OH, YEAH.

21:48.608 --> 21:53.079
UH, I'LL BE FINE.
THEY CAN'T GET RID
OF ME, PAUL.

21:53.179 --> 21:56.015
"APRES MOI,
LE DELUGE."

21:56.115 --> 21:58.485
AFTER YOU, THE FLOOD?

21:58.585 --> 22:01.253
- THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.
- YEAH, WELL,

22:01.354 --> 22:04.156
THE GLUE, PAUL, THE GLUE.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.394
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN I LEFT.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.830
WELL, I GUESS MY DAUGHTER

22:10.930 --> 22:12.865
CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT ME

22:12.965 --> 22:14.901
BUT THE DONALDSONS CAN'T.

22:17.236 --> 22:21.374
SO, UM...
WILL I SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK?

22:21.474 --> 22:24.010
YEAH, AND THANKS AGAIN.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.413
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.422
MARIE, CALL BURT AND--

22:35.522 --> 22:37.624
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T GET HIM?

22:37.724 --> 22:40.860
YOU JUST LEFT ME A MESSAGE
HE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH ME.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.695
WHAT ABOUT THE OLD MAN?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.866
DON'T MOVE.
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS...

22:49.335 --> 22:51.704
( theme music playing )
