00:30.266 --> 00:32.800
Welcome, welcome,

00:32.867 --> 00:33.867
welcome to "last week tonight."

00:33.900 --> 00:34.700
I'm John Oliver, thank you so

00:34.767 --> 00:36.166
much for joining us.

00:36.233 --> 00:37.233
Just time for a quick recap of

00:37.266 --> 00:39.200
the week, and it was a busy one

00:39.266 --> 00:40.400
for the president, who, in

00:40.467 --> 00:41.800
between claiming his father was

00:41.867 --> 00:43.900
born in Germany when he was born

00:43.967 --> 00:46.467
in New York, mispronouncing the

00:46.533 --> 00:47.900
word "origins" as "oranges"

00:47.967 --> 00:49.400
repeatedly, and trolling

00:49.467 --> 00:51.000
Joe biden for touching women...

00:51.066 --> 00:54.233
which seems, y'know, a bit

00:54.300 --> 00:55.533
fucking rich... made a major and

00:55.600 --> 00:57.233
shocking decision on Thursday

00:57.300 --> 00:58.834
regarding the federal reserve.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.233
President trump is said to of

01:00.300 --> 01:00.934
selected Herman Cain for the

01:01.000 --> 01:03.367
federal reserve board.

01:03.433 --> 01:04.800
A former pizza executive

01:04.867 --> 01:07.200
turned radio talk show host who

01:07.266 --> 01:08.633
dropped his 2012 republican

01:08.700 --> 01:10.200
presidential bid amid sexual

01:10.266 --> 01:11.333
harassment allegations, not a

01:11.400 --> 01:12.834
typical resume for a federal

01:12.900 --> 01:13.700
reserve board member.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.800
Oh, really?

01:16.867 --> 01:17.700
You sure about that?

01:17.767 --> 01:18.367
You think the resume of

01:18.433 --> 01:19.266
pizza maker, talk show host, and

01:19.333 --> 01:20.400
alleged sexual harasser would be

01:20.467 --> 01:21.900
pretty unusual for the fed?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.233
Well, why don't you tell that to

01:23.300 --> 01:24.133
the rest of the board, six

01:24.200 --> 01:27.433
Mario batalis?

01:27.500 --> 01:28.300
But it is true, picking

01:28.367 --> 01:29.066
Herman Cain for the federal

01:29.133 --> 01:30.266
reserve is bonkers, and comes

01:30.333 --> 01:32.700
just two weeks after trump also

01:32.767 --> 01:34.100
said he'll nominate

01:34.166 --> 01:34.934
Stephen Moore, a TV commentator

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
and fellow at a conservative

01:36.066 --> 01:39.567
think tank.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.834
And these two likely nominees

01:40.900 --> 01:42.600
are causing more concern than

01:42.667 --> 01:43.533
your typical trump

01:43.600 --> 01:46.033
administration appointee, and

01:46.100 --> 01:47.433
for good reason, as I'll let a

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
former deputy secretary of the

01:48.567 --> 01:49.166
treasury explain.

01:49.233 --> 01:50.166
It's one thing to be putting,

01:50.233 --> 01:50.800
you know, your political friends

01:50.867 --> 01:51.400
and cronies, you know, within

01:51.467 --> 01:52.567
the agencies, but to put them on

01:52.633 --> 01:53.900
the board of the central bank is

01:53.967 --> 01:56.066
something that is... that has to

01:56.133 --> 01:58.200
be done very, very cautiously,

01:58.266 --> 02:00.967
because the moment the fed loses

02:01.033 --> 02:02.467
credibility, it's almost

02:02.533 --> 02:04.900
game over.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.266
Now, that's a pretty

02:06.333 --> 02:07.033
bold statement.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.567
She's basically saying,

02:10.633 --> 02:11.867
"go ahead, put 'Mr. oops' in

02:11.934 --> 02:12.867
charge of the department of

02:12.934 --> 02:13.500
energy, or a mint condition cpr

02:13.567 --> 02:14.467
dummy in charge of opioids and

02:14.533 --> 02:16.633
middle east peace, or hand the

02:16.700 --> 02:17.600
commerce department over to a

02:17.667 --> 02:18.834
man who looks like

02:18.900 --> 02:19.800
Jackson pollock if he had lived

02:19.867 --> 02:21.433
or Moby if he had died.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.600
But the fed?

02:22.667 --> 02:23.500
You don't fuck around with the

02:23.567 --> 02:26.500
fed.

02:26.567 --> 02:27.333
And that is because a lot of

02:27.400 --> 02:28.100
America's economic power depends

02:28.166 --> 02:29.734
on people's trust in the

02:29.800 --> 02:33.066
stability of the dollar.

02:33.133 --> 02:33.800
It is the world's reserve

02:33.867 --> 02:34.867
currency in part because the fed

02:34.934 --> 02:35.800
is seen as a reliable,

02:35.867 --> 02:38.834
independent institution.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.633
Trump has actually already

02:40.700 --> 02:41.567
filled four of the fed's seven

02:41.633 --> 02:42.834
seats... including the chairman,

02:42.900 --> 02:43.367
Jerome Powell... but those

02:43.433 --> 02:43.967
appointments didn't get much

02:44.033 --> 02:44.567
press because all of these

02:44.633 --> 02:45.633
people are fundamentally

02:45.700 --> 02:48.767
qualified.

02:48.834 --> 02:49.400
Cain and Moore, however, aren't.

02:49.467 --> 02:50.333
Cain has argued for a return to

02:50.400 --> 02:51.800
the gold standard, a virtually

02:51.867 --> 02:53.667
unheard-of opinion among

02:53.734 --> 02:55.533
respected economists, while

02:55.600 --> 02:59.600
Moore is a tireless advocate of

02:59.667 --> 03:01.333
supply-side economics, he helped

03:01.400 --> 03:03.100
design the tax cut that blew a

03:03.166 --> 03:04.100
hole in Kansas' budget, and once

03:04.166 --> 03:05.100
asked if the country even really

03:05.166 --> 03:07.667
needs a fed.

03:07.734 --> 03:08.734
But instead of spending time

03:08.800 --> 03:09.967
breaking down why their economic

03:10.033 --> 03:12.834
views should be disqualifying,

03:12.900 --> 03:14.000
I'd like to make a point that

03:14.066 --> 03:18.200
requires no knowledge of

03:18.300 --> 03:21.233
monetary policy whatsoever, and

03:21.300 --> 03:22.100
that is that these two guys are

03:22.166 --> 03:23.066
goofs.

03:23.133 --> 03:23.934
They're just a pair of

03:24.000 --> 03:27.066
dangerously goofy goofs.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.600
And this isn't actually a job

03:28.667 --> 03:29.000
where that's okay.

03:29.066 --> 03:29.734
Fed board members are famously

03:29.800 --> 03:30.867
careful with anything they say

03:30.934 --> 03:31.633
in public because markets can

03:31.700 --> 03:32.967
react violently.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.533
Just two words from the fed

03:34.600 --> 03:36.667
chair sent markets soaring last

03:36.734 --> 03:37.667
November, and these two are not

03:37.734 --> 03:39.433
known for thinking before they

03:39.500 --> 03:43.500
speak.

03:43.567 --> 03:44.266
Here's is Stephen Moore on a CNN

03:44.333 --> 03:45.033
panel last year discussing

03:45.100 --> 03:45.767
stormy Daniels and deciding to

03:45.834 --> 03:47.266
blow the doors off the room with

03:47.333 --> 03:52.500
this awesome joke.

03:52.567 --> 03:53.734
We're discussing a sitting

03:53.800 --> 03:54.867
president being sued by a

03:54.934 --> 03:55.667
porn star, and it's part of

03:55.734 --> 03:56.433
almost like the routine of

03:56.500 --> 03:57.266
today's news cycle, which is the

03:57.333 --> 03:58.300
interesting part of it.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.166
Kevin, are you saying that a

03:59.233 --> 04:00.367
porn star would actually try to

04:00.433 --> 04:01.867
call attention to herself?

04:01.934 --> 04:09.000
Shocking, right?

04:09.066 --> 04:09.900
I mean, that's what

04:09.967 --> 04:10.767
porn stars do!

04:10.834 --> 04:14.400
Nailed it.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.132
You nailed it, Stephen.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.966
You don't want that man's mouth

04:17.033 --> 04:17.767
moving markets.

04:17.834 --> 04:18.767
Now, as for Herman Cain, let me

04:18.834 --> 04:19.834
remind you, this is a man who,

04:19.899 --> 04:21.533
when he ran for president, once

04:21.600 --> 04:22.033
asked a crowd of

04:22.100 --> 04:24.000
Cuban-Americans, "how do you say

04:24.066 --> 04:25.500
'delicious' in Cuban?,"

04:25.567 --> 04:26.734
he bragged about not knowing the

04:26.800 --> 04:30.667
president of

04:30.734 --> 04:31.533
"uzbeki-beki-beki-

04:31.600 --> 04:32.834
Stan-Stan," and had this

04:32.900 --> 04:33.300
memorable moment in a

04:33.367 --> 04:34.500
presidential debate:

04:34.567 --> 04:35.867
A poet once said, "life can

04:35.934 --> 04:38.166
be a challenge, life can seem

04:38.233 --> 04:38.800
impossible, but it's never easy

04:38.867 --> 04:39.900
when there's so much on the

04:39.967 --> 04:40.934
line."

04:41.000 --> 04:42.100
All right, so, it turns out

04:42.166 --> 04:43.533
that quote wasn't exactly

04:43.600 --> 04:44.667
poetry.

04:44.734 --> 04:46.200
It was, strictly speaking, a

04:46.233 --> 04:48.400
song from the end of

04:48.500 --> 04:50.400
"pokemon the movie" from 2000.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.133
It's true.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.767
It's true.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.967
Herman Cain quoted this pokemon

04:55.033 --> 04:56.800
movie during a presidential

04:56.867 --> 04:58.600
debate, which is both the worst

04:58.667 --> 04:59.800
place to do that and also

04:59.867 --> 05:01.834
technically the best place to do

05:01.900 --> 05:03.467
it, because who on that stage is

05:03.533 --> 05:05.233
going to risk calling you out?

05:05.300 --> 05:06.500
"Excuse me, but I believe my

05:06.567 --> 05:08.000
opponent just attributed that

05:08.066 --> 05:09.467
quote to a poet, when it really

05:09.533 --> 05:11.200
comes from the theme song to the

05:11.266 --> 05:14.500
film 'pokemon the movie 2000,'

05:14.567 --> 05:16.633
whose lyrics I also know by

05:16.700 --> 05:18.500
heart, and oh, god, I'm just now

05:18.567 --> 05:19.700
realizing this is worse for me

05:19.767 --> 05:20.700
than it is for him, please carry

05:20.767 --> 05:21.734
on.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.166
Ignore what I just said."

05:24.233 --> 05:25.967
And as if all that weren't

05:26.033 --> 05:26.667
disqualifying enough, I know

05:26.734 --> 05:27.934
personally that Herman Cain

05:28.000 --> 05:29.400
should not be on the fed,

05:29.467 --> 05:31.233
because after he dropped out of

05:31.300 --> 05:32.533
that presidential race, I did a

05:32.600 --> 05:34.367
series of interviews with him

05:34.433 --> 05:35.200
for "the daily show" where he

05:35.266 --> 05:36.233
pretended to be in office, and

05:36.300 --> 05:37.633
in which he, for some reason,

05:37.700 --> 05:39.500
did anything I asked him to do.

05:39.567 --> 05:40.066
Anything.

05:40.133 --> 05:42.133
Watch.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.500
Look into that camera and

05:43.567 --> 05:45.100
convince Nicolas cage to give

05:45.166 --> 05:50.900
that constitution back.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.934
Nicolas, bring back our

05:53.000 --> 05:58.567
constitution.

05:58.633 --> 05:59.400
I respect you, cage, but get a

05:59.467 --> 06:00.633
grip.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.700
We have just had the results

06:01.767 --> 06:02.500
back from your latest

06:02.567 --> 06:03.900
presidential physical, and it

06:03.967 --> 06:05.266
turns out you have telepathic

06:05.333 --> 06:06.600
powers.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.033
Look into that camera and

06:08.100 --> 06:09.567
convince the Chinese that they

06:09.633 --> 06:18.600
need to step down.

06:18.667 --> 06:19.500
It's your move.

06:19.567 --> 06:20.734
Oil is spilling everywhere

06:20.800 --> 06:22.133
and it has devastated America's

06:22.200 --> 06:23.066
national parks.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.433
Gather those most affected and

06:24.500 --> 06:25.533
explain to them why their

06:25.600 --> 06:32.800
sacrifice is not in vain.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.233
Creatures of the forest,

06:40.300 --> 06:43.667
assemble!

06:43.734 --> 06:44.700
If any part of you is

06:44.767 --> 06:45.800
thinking, how did I get him to

06:45.867 --> 06:47.333
do that stuff?

06:47.400 --> 06:48.633
I just asked him.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.033
Once.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.200
He took orders from some

06:51.266 --> 06:53.300
birdy twit with a pixie cut.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.934
And look, at this point, you may

06:55.000 --> 06:57.967
be wondering what trump sees in

06:58.033 --> 07:00.066
these two men.

07:00.133 --> 07:03.934
Well, just that.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.467
He wants people who will do

07:05.533 --> 07:07.367
exactly what he tells them to.

07:07.433 --> 07:08.266
You've just seen how well Cain

07:08.333 --> 07:09.200
takes direction, and Moore is

07:09.266 --> 07:09.900
such a trump sycophant that he

07:09.967 --> 07:13.500
co-wrote a flattering book

07:13.567 --> 07:14.433
called "trumponomics" and said

07:14.500 --> 07:15.066
trump should win the nobel prize

07:15.133 --> 07:15.900
in economics.

07:15.967 --> 07:16.600
And this should be worrying to

07:16.667 --> 07:17.734
you, as trump seems to be

07:17.800 --> 07:18.633
looking to bring the fed under

07:18.700 --> 07:19.500
his control.

07:19.567 --> 07:20.734
He's reportedly furious that it

07:20.800 --> 07:22.100
has raised interest rates,

07:22.166 --> 07:23.333
slowing down the stock market,

07:23.400 --> 07:24.900
and he's publicly attacked

07:24.967 --> 07:25.533
Jerome Powell, a huge breach of

07:25.600 --> 07:26.500
custom, and reportedly

07:26.567 --> 07:27.900
considered firing him.

07:27.967 --> 07:30.500
And if he manages to install

07:30.567 --> 07:31.033
Moore and Cain, that could

07:31.100 --> 07:32.467
fundamentally undermine the fed,

07:32.533 --> 07:34.433
so it's important the senate

07:34.500 --> 07:37.266
stand against these nominations.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.467
And I know that this could be a

07:38.533 --> 07:41.033
difficult fight, but as a poet

07:41.100 --> 07:42.734
once said, "come with me, the

07:42.800 --> 07:43.900
time is right.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.367
There's no better team.

07:45.433 --> 07:47.500
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.066
It's always been our dream.

07:50.133 --> 07:51.233
Pokemon.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.066
Gotta catch em' all.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.033
It's you and me, I know it's my

07:56.100 --> 07:57.567
destiny.

07:57.633 --> 08:04.867
Pokemon."

08:04.934 --> 08:05.600
Let's move on now to Baltimore.

08:05.667 --> 08:06.934
Baltimore is a great place to

08:07.000 --> 08:08.367
get crabs if you can't find

08:08.433 --> 08:09.567
post Malone.

08:09.633 --> 08:10.934
Now, Baltimore has a long

08:11.000 --> 08:12.367
history of corruption, but its

08:12.433 --> 08:12.867
latest scandal is truly

08:12.934 --> 08:14.734
remarkable.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.667
Well, mayor Catherine pugh is

08:15.734 --> 08:16.734
speaking out amid the ethics

08:16.800 --> 08:17.934
controversy surrounding her

08:18.000 --> 08:19.333
business dealings with the

08:19.400 --> 08:20.700
university of Maryland medical

08:20.767 --> 08:23.834
system.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.367
The mayor had served on the

08:25.433 --> 08:26.467
board of directors since 2001,

08:26.533 --> 08:27.967
and throughout an eight-year

08:28.033 --> 08:29.133
period, she sold the medical

08:29.200 --> 08:29.767
system $500,000 worth of her

08:29.834 --> 08:30.700
"healthy Holly" children's

08:30.767 --> 08:34.100
books.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.100
It's true.

08:35.166 --> 08:35.767
Baltimore's mayor has apparently

08:35.833 --> 08:37.366
made hundreds of thousands of

08:37.433 --> 08:38.500
dollars off several local

08:38.567 --> 08:39.767
entities, some of which have

08:39.833 --> 08:41.299
business before the city,

08:41.366 --> 08:41.900
purchasing her self-published

08:41.967 --> 08:43.400
books, including "healthy Holly:

08:43.467 --> 08:45.367
Vegetables are not just green,"

08:45.433 --> 08:46.333
Fruits come in

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
colors like the rainbow," and

08:47.467 --> 08:48.834
presumably, "healthy Holly:

08:48.900 --> 08:49.700
Fruits come in vegetables but

08:49.767 --> 08:50.834
only when they receive verbal

08:50.900 --> 08:52.600
consent."

08:52.667 --> 08:54.266
And look, look, it is hard to

08:54.333 --> 08:56.600
believe pugh's books were purely

08:56.667 --> 08:58.734
bought on the basis of literary

08:58.800 --> 09:00.066
merit.

09:00.133 --> 09:01.934
Reporters who've read them have

09:02.000 --> 09:03.300
pointed out that, for a start,

09:03.367 --> 09:04.333
she can't seem to settle on the

09:04.400 --> 09:05.667
correct spelling of the name for

09:05.734 --> 09:07.266
one of her main characters.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.266
Also, she seems to think a

09:08.333 --> 09:09.834
normal, healthy dinner involves

09:09.900 --> 09:11.200
a family gathered around four

09:11.233 --> 09:12.834
massive plates of salad with one

09:12.900 --> 09:14.166
smaller salad that sits in the

09:14.233 --> 09:15.567
center of the table untouched

09:15.633 --> 09:18.133
while your dad says normal

09:18.200 --> 09:19.033
things like, "we are having

09:19.100 --> 09:20.233
spinach with our dinner.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.333
It is a vegetable."

09:22.400 --> 09:24.066
And finally, in her educational

09:24.133 --> 09:25.900
children's book about eating

09:25.967 --> 09:26.433
right, she spelled fucking

09:26.500 --> 09:28.967
"vegetable" wrong.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.166
And "vege tale" sounds like

09:30.233 --> 09:31.734
slang that douchey bros use when

09:31.800 --> 09:32.300
they pick up girls at vegan

09:32.367 --> 09:34.734
restaurants.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.934
"Yah, brah, I'm gonna gulp down

09:36.000 --> 09:37.400
some quinoa, pretend I fucks

09:37.467 --> 09:39.467
with Kale, and then try to smash

09:39.533 --> 09:40.667
some of that vege tale.

09:40.734 --> 09:44.467
All day, son.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.767
All day."

09:46.834 --> 09:48.200
And the scandal widened this

09:48.266 --> 09:49.834
week after it emerged that the

09:49.900 --> 09:51.166
amount she has received from

09:51.233 --> 09:52.667
high-profile organizations or

09:52.734 --> 09:55.533
people has now reached $800,000.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.533
Pugh is now on leave because

09:56.600 --> 09:57.800
she's fighting pneumonia, but

09:57.867 --> 09:58.834
before she left, she called a

09:58.900 --> 09:59.934
press conference to defend

10:00.000 --> 10:01.867
herself.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.433
And in this appearance, where

10:03.500 --> 10:05.333
she was dealing with accusations

10:05.400 --> 10:06.300
that she'd misused her office to

10:06.367 --> 10:07.834
promote a side project, she did

10:08.667 --> 10:10.700
Mayor pugh also showed us her

10:10.767 --> 10:11.767
child clothing line which has

10:11.834 --> 10:13.667
slogans to get active on them as

10:13.734 --> 10:15.900
well.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.533
There was bibs and onesies.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.433
It's true.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.667
She basically started Hawking

10:19.734 --> 10:21.600
her idea for a kids' clothing

10:21.667 --> 10:22.300
line, and she did it for three

10:22.367 --> 10:24.967
full minutes.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.633
As you can see from these

10:27.700 --> 10:29.867
bibs, it was about teaching

10:29.934 --> 10:31.066
children to walk, run, crawl,

10:31.133 --> 10:34.467
skip, dance.

10:34.533 --> 10:38.633
Some to eat healthier.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.367
To play and crawl.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.934
And same thing here with the

10:43.000 --> 10:44.633
messaging.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.633
Swim, jump, play,

10:45.700 --> 10:47.533
walk, run, crawl.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.500
Okay, a few things

10:49.567 --> 10:51.000
First, "walk, run, crawl,

10:51.066 --> 10:51.834
skip, dance," sounds less like

10:51.900 --> 10:53.066
something you'd put on a onesie

10:53.133 --> 10:53.633
and more like something that

10:53.700 --> 10:54.266
bjork whispers to you at the end

10:54.333 --> 10:55.200
of a conversation instead of

10:55.266 --> 10:56.700
saying "goodbye."

10:56.767 --> 10:57.800
"Walk, run, crawl, skip, dance.

10:57.867 --> 11:04.200
Hee-hee!"

11:04.266 --> 11:05.900
Second, second, if the clothes

11:05.967 --> 11:07.367
you're making are that small,

11:07.433 --> 11:08.934
your baby is not ready to swim.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.233
And finally, how is a baby

11:10.300 --> 11:11.233
supposed to learn healthy eating

11:11.300 --> 11:13.734
habits from a bib that reads

11:13.800 --> 11:14.400
"eat healthy"?

11:14.467 --> 11:15.166
The baby can't see the bib when

11:15.233 --> 11:15.900
it's on.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.033
It just can't bend its neck far

11:17.100 --> 11:17.500
enough.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.367
And I know what you're thinking,

11:18.433 --> 11:19.867
just look in the mirror, baby.

11:19.934 --> 11:20.500
Look in the mirror after you put

11:20.567 --> 11:21.667
your bib on but before you eat.

11:21.734 --> 11:22.867
But then, of course, the writing

11:22.934 --> 11:24.333
will be backwards, making it

11:24.400 --> 11:27.233
even more difficult to decipher

11:27.300 --> 11:28.100
for a baby who already...

11:28.166 --> 11:29.467
and this is true... cannot

11:29.533 --> 11:30.367
fucking read.

11:30.433 --> 11:33.600
But let's put all that aside and

11:33.667 --> 11:34.166
let's say this baby can read

11:34.233 --> 11:35.367
backwards, looks in the mirror

11:35.433 --> 11:36.333
before a meal, and intuits the

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
message that it should eat

11:37.467 --> 11:38.233
healthy.

11:38.300 --> 11:38.900
It's still going to be

11:38.967 --> 11:40.233
physically strapped into a chair

11:40.300 --> 11:42.033
and fed whatever its parents

11:42.100 --> 11:43.066
pick because babies have no

11:43.133 --> 11:44.066
agency 'cause that's how babies

11:44.133 --> 11:47.900
work.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.734
Now, investigators are now

11:49.800 --> 11:51.133
looking into this situation, and

11:51.200 --> 11:53.000
while there have been no charges

11:53.066 --> 11:53.900
so far, the whole thing does not

11:53.967 --> 11:59.467
look good for the mayor.

11:59.533 --> 12:00.400
And unless there is some very

12:00.467 --> 12:01.633
good explanation that I can't

12:01.700 --> 12:02.633
see and does not exist, it

12:02.700 --> 12:03.867
might be better for her to read

12:03.934 --> 12:05.467
the writing on the onesie and

12:05.533 --> 12:10.033
walk, run, crawl, skip, dance,

12:10.100 --> 12:11.266
her way out of office.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.533
And now this.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.700
And now, a

12:13.767 --> 12:14.567
tribute to the secret star of

12:14.633 --> 12:17.433
divorce court.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.100
Mr. Marino, did your wife

12:20.166 --> 12:22.233
catch you with your situation

12:22.300 --> 12:22.900
out on your phone, texting it to

12:22.967 --> 12:24.200
other people?

12:24.266 --> 12:27.333
It couldn't have been me.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.033
I don't know.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.333
I was like, well, I knew she

12:32.400 --> 12:35.900
found out.

12:35.967 --> 12:36.800
I'm just going to make up an

12:36.867 --> 12:37.900
age.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.200
We hang out all the time, so

12:40.266 --> 12:42.567
I wouldn't remember...

12:42.633 --> 12:44.033
I do tend to react that way,

12:44.100 --> 12:44.867
because my feelings be hurt.

12:44.934 --> 12:45.633
Because that's how large the

12:45.700 --> 12:47.000
argument was throughout those

12:47.066 --> 12:47.767
few days.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.100
You should have known I was

12:49.166 --> 12:50.000
going out with some other guy.

12:50.066 --> 12:51.800
Right.

12:51.867 --> 12:58.934
Because I feel...

12:59.000 --> 12:59.934
there's no "I guess."

13:00.000 --> 13:00.600
If I say something...

13:00.667 --> 13:01.266
a lot of the conversation was

13:01.333 --> 13:03.300
because...

13:03.367 --> 13:08.266
I did do that.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.433
But that's not how we started.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.233
She was in the backseat with

13:11.300 --> 13:12.500
two dudes in the car.

13:12.567 --> 13:13.133
Oh!

13:13.200 --> 13:13.967
Moving on.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.600
Our main story tonight concerns

13:16.667 --> 13:18.100
mobile homes.

13:18.166 --> 13:18.600
Perfected by humans, but

13:18.667 --> 13:19.233
invented by snails.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.700
There are many misconceptions

13:21.767 --> 13:22.500
about mobile, or manufactured

13:22.567 --> 13:23.166
homes.

13:23.233 --> 13:24.567
For instance, right now, you may

13:24.600 --> 13:25.133
be picturing something that

13:25.166 --> 13:25.834
looks like this.

13:25.900 --> 13:26.867
But for decades, the industry

13:26.934 --> 13:28.200
has been trying to change that

13:28.266 --> 13:28.767
image, running ads like this

13:30.800 --> 13:31.767
You bought a mobile home?

13:33.767 --> 13:35.166
Today's manufactured home.

13:35.233 --> 13:38.967
You bought a house!

13:39.033 --> 13:40.467
Factory-built quality at a

13:40.533 --> 13:42.166
price that makes sense.

13:42.233 --> 13:45.567
We have three big bedrooms.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.033
I love it.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.834
It's a manufactured home.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.367
Today's manufactured home.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.166
You bought a house.

13:52.233 --> 13:55.734
Okay.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.233
I think I get it.

13:57.300 --> 13:57.834
But for the record, that sexy

13:57.900 --> 13:58.400
saxophone riff would make a

13:58.467 --> 13:59.000
reveal of anything seem good.

13:59.066 --> 14:00.333
Here, I'll show you.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.600
You bought a taxidermy fox?

14:04.433 --> 14:08.433
You bought a fox!

14:08.500 --> 14:12.533
But it is true, it can be

14:12.600 --> 14:13.567
genuinely hard to tell the

14:13.633 --> 14:14.467
difference between manufactured

14:14.533 --> 14:15.834
homes and conventional homes.

14:15.900 --> 14:16.633
Just like it's hard to tell the

14:16.700 --> 14:17.467
difference between

14:17.533 --> 14:18.467
Jessica chastain and

14:18.533 --> 14:19.834
Bryce Dallas Howard.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.767
The difference is, like a mobile

14:21.834 --> 14:24.266
home, Bryce Dallas Howard is

14:24.333 --> 14:26.066
assembled off-site then placed

14:26.133 --> 14:26.600
on wheels and moved to her

14:26.667 --> 14:28.467
permanent location.

14:28.533 --> 14:29.734
Around 20 million people live in

14:29.800 --> 14:31.233
mobile homes.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.734
That's roughly 1 in 18

14:32.800 --> 14:33.934
Americans, and they're one of

14:34.000 --> 14:35.166
America's last affordable

14:35.233 --> 14:36.433
housing options, costing up to

14:36.500 --> 14:37.567
50% less per square foot than a

14:37.633 --> 14:44.333
conventional house.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.700
Which is great, but in recent

14:45.767 --> 14:46.867
years, some of the biggest

14:46.934 --> 14:47.567
investors in America

14:47.633 --> 14:48.400
have moved into this industry.

14:48.467 --> 14:49.367
According to one new report,

14:49.433 --> 14:50.667
over 100,000 home sites,

14:50.734 --> 14:51.533
traditionally run by mom-and-pop

14:51.600 --> 14:52.767
businesses, are now owned or

14:52.834 --> 14:53.800
partly owned by private equity

14:53.867 --> 14:55.166
firms like these.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.533
So the homes of some of the

14:56.600 --> 14:58.100
poorest people in America are

14:58.200 --> 14:59.433
getting snapped up by some of

14:59.500 --> 15:01.133
the richest people in America.

15:01.200 --> 15:01.834
And luckily, there've been no

15:01.900 --> 15:04.800
problems whatsoever.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.567
Except I'm obviously kidding.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.367
It's going terribly.

15:09.433 --> 15:10.367
If you want to hear me lie about

15:10.433 --> 15:11.367
stories to make you feel better,

15:11.433 --> 15:12.800
you might enjoy our spinoff

15:12.867 --> 15:14.333
show, "everything's fine!

15:14.400 --> 15:15.400
With John Oliver."

15:15.467 --> 15:16.567
Did you know Isis is just

15:16.633 --> 15:18.300
hamsters?

15:18.367 --> 15:19.133
This little terrorist's name is

15:19.200 --> 15:20.867
dumpling, and he doesn't even

15:20.934 --> 15:26.934
know how to use his gun!

15:27.000 --> 15:27.633
Sadly, back in the real world,

15:27.700 --> 15:29.900
the truth is, the rise of

15:29.967 --> 15:30.767
big-money investors in mobile

15:30.834 --> 15:31.867
homes has led to a corresponding

15:31.934 --> 15:32.967
spike in rents, fees, and

15:33.033 --> 15:34.400
local-news stories like these:

15:34.467 --> 15:35.567
People living at a local

15:35.633 --> 15:36.934
mobile home park outraged over

15:37.000 --> 15:39.233
the sharp increase in lot rent.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.066
Rents were raised by as much

15:41.133 --> 15:43.133
as 36%.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
Rents were raised by nearly

15:44.266 --> 15:45.900
60%.

15:45.967 --> 15:47.266
Ella karcher lives on a fixed

15:47.333 --> 15:48.333
income.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.734
Her lot rent's just gone up, and

15:49.800 --> 15:50.433
it all adds up to a bill she

15:50.500 --> 15:51.667
can't afford.

15:51.734 --> 15:53.266
Now it's a matter of, "okay,

15:53.333 --> 15:55.867
now which medication am I going

15:55.934 --> 15:57.200
to take and half so that I can

15:57.266 --> 15:58.166
make it stretch out a little bit

15:58.233 --> 16:04.800
longer."

16:04.867 --> 16:05.333
That's clearly

16:05.400 --> 16:05.867
horrible.

16:05.934 --> 16:06.834
Nobody should be made to stretch

16:06.900 --> 16:07.633
out medicine.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.600
It's sad enough when you stretch

16:08.667 --> 16:09.533
out your almost-empty bottle of

16:09.600 --> 16:10.133
shampoo by adding a bunch of

16:10.200 --> 16:10.967
water.

16:11.033 --> 16:11.667
And if you didn't relate to that

16:11.734 --> 16:12.834
joke, you haven't suffered a

16:12.900 --> 16:15.133
single day in your life.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.400
So tonight, let's take a look at

16:16.467 --> 16:18.333
the mobile home industry.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.767
And let's start with the company

16:19.834 --> 16:21.633
that sells more mobile homes

16:21.700 --> 16:22.934
than any other, Clayton homes,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.433
controlled by one of the richest

16:24.500 --> 16:26.467
men in America, Warren buffett.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.033
Although the company's ads used

16:29.100 --> 16:30.233
to feature a more down-home

16:30.300 --> 16:31.266
spokesman.

16:31.333 --> 16:32.800
What do I know about

16:32.867 --> 16:33.667
Clayton homes?

16:33.734 --> 16:34.934
I know they're built right here

16:35.000 --> 16:36.367
in America.

16:36.433 --> 16:37.133
And they know the difference

16:37.200 --> 16:42.200
between a house and a home.

16:42.266 --> 16:43.233
Hey, miss Kay, a home is where

16:43.300 --> 16:44.467
you get your famous sweet potato

16:44.533 --> 16:45.266
pie, honey.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.567
And you all know how we all

16:47.633 --> 16:48.433
try to make miss Kay happy,

16:48.500 --> 16:49.900
happy, happy.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.233
Clayton homes.

16:50.300 --> 16:50.734
Good call.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.033
Judging by that creepy

16:54.100 --> 16:55.800
delivery, there is no way that

16:55.867 --> 16:56.867
"getting her famous sweet potato

16:56.934 --> 16:58.667
pie" is not also code for some

16:58.734 --> 17:01.767
kind of disgusting sex act.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.233
It probably means miss Kay

17:03.300 --> 17:04.500
smearing pie filling on his

17:04.567 --> 17:06.165
ball sack while a live duck

17:06.233 --> 17:09.333
scrapes it off with its bill.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.032
And if it does, good call.

17:12.867 --> 17:14.967
But the key difference between a

17:15.032 --> 17:17.233
mobile and conventional home has

17:17.300 --> 17:18.367
nothing to do with pie.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.367
It has to do with how it retains

17:20.433 --> 17:21.367
its value.

17:21.433 --> 17:22.967
Just listen to finance guru

17:23.032 --> 17:24.165
Dave Ramsey give his no-nonsense

17:24.233 --> 17:25.767
take on whether or not you

17:25.834 --> 17:27.133
should buy one.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.133
Mobile homes go down in

17:28.200 --> 17:29.166
value.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.467
It's the only thing that you

17:30.533 --> 17:31.900
own, that you live in, that goes

17:31.967 --> 17:34.867
down in value.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.767
Even if you buy dirt under it

17:36.834 --> 17:38.867
that goes up in value more than

17:38.934 --> 17:39.567
it goes down in value so it

17:39.633 --> 17:40.867
appears you didn't lose money,

17:40.934 --> 17:42.400
you lost money.

17:42.467 --> 17:43.300
You buy a $50,000 mobile home,

17:43.367 --> 17:45.033
in a few years, it's a $10,000

17:45.133 --> 17:46.333
mobile home.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.300
I mean, cars go down in value,

17:47.367 --> 17:48.400
mobile homes go down in value.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.700
It's a car you sleep in.

17:50.767 --> 17:52.000
I gotta say, I find the

17:52.066 --> 17:53.133
negativity of his tone genuinely

17:53.200 --> 17:54.734
refreshing there.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.133
That guy should replace

17:56.200 --> 17:56.900
Jim cramer on his show.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.133
No more running around excitedly

17:58.200 --> 17:59.667
pressing buttons like a little

17:59.734 --> 18:01.467
boy at an arcade, just an angry

18:01.533 --> 18:02.400
old grump hunched over a desk

18:02.467 --> 18:04.467
telling you you're going to lose

18:04.533 --> 18:06.834
money.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.166
So mobile homes may be a

18:08.233 --> 18:09.500
terrible investment for people

18:09.567 --> 18:10.567
buying them, but they've been an

18:10.633 --> 18:11.800
incredible investment for

18:11.867 --> 18:13.633
Warren buffett.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.967
Clayton homes generated pre-tax

18:15.033 --> 18:16.367
earnings of $911 million last

18:16.433 --> 18:18.400
year, and they've done that not

18:18.467 --> 18:20.367
just by selling homes but by

18:20.433 --> 18:21.567
financing them as well, because

18:21.633 --> 18:23.033
instead of being financed with

18:23.100 --> 18:25.033
mortgages, mobile homes tend to

18:25.100 --> 18:26.433
be bought with high-interest,

18:26.500 --> 18:28.400
shorter-term chattel loans, the

18:28.467 --> 18:29.767
kind you'd use to buy a car or a

18:29.834 --> 18:31.600
TV.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.133
And an investigation a few years

18:33.200 --> 18:34.700
back found Clayton relies on

18:34.767 --> 18:36.200
predatory sales practices,

18:36.266 --> 18:38.033
exorbitant fees, and interest

18:38.100 --> 18:39.967
rates that can exceed 15%,

18:40.033 --> 18:41.233
trapping many buyers in loans

18:41.300 --> 18:42.934
they can't afford.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.100
Now, Clayton strenuously denies

18:45.166 --> 18:46.600
all that, saying the report was

18:46.667 --> 18:48.834
based on isolated incidents, and

18:48.900 --> 18:50.200
its customers report high levels

18:50.266 --> 18:52.000
of satisfaction.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.367
Although I will point out that

18:54.433 --> 18:56.266
one of those isolated incidents

18:56.333 --> 18:58.166
was this call a Clayton customer

18:58.233 --> 18:59.000
got when she fell behind on

18:59.066 --> 19:00.367
payments.

19:00.433 --> 19:01.567
Why don't you try something

19:01.633 --> 19:02.533
to come up with the money by the

19:02.600 --> 19:04.734
31st?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.000
What should you... what do

19:06.066 --> 19:07.600
you suggest except for the

19:07.667 --> 19:08.667
things that you already suggest,

19:08.734 --> 19:10.867
which doesn't work?

19:10.934 --> 19:12.600
Donate plasma or donate

19:12.667 --> 19:13.700
blood.

19:13.767 --> 19:14.667
Really?

19:14.734 --> 19:16.300
I'ma get $800 for that?

19:16.367 --> 19:18.066
No.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.100
But that's one way to come up

19:19.166 --> 19:20.500
with a little bit of money,

19:20.567 --> 19:21.266
though.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.767
Holy shit.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.967
"Go donate blood."

19:25.033 --> 19:26.500
I guess one way to get your

19:26.567 --> 19:27.900
customers to report high levels

19:27.967 --> 19:29.300
of satisfaction is to make sure

19:29.367 --> 19:30.734
they're all feeling light-headed

19:30.800 --> 19:31.500
after you literally bleed them

19:31.567 --> 19:33.533
fucking dry.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.700
But one of the biggest problems

19:34.767 --> 19:36.367
here isn't even to do with how

19:36.433 --> 19:38.300
you pay for a mobile home or how

19:38.367 --> 19:39.867
quickly it loses value.

19:39.934 --> 19:41.433
It's where you put it.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
Because around a third of

19:42.567 --> 19:44.033
mobile home dwellers own their

19:44.100 --> 19:45.867
homes but don't own the land

19:45.934 --> 19:47.667
underneath it.

19:47.734 --> 19:48.800
That's because they live in

19:48.867 --> 19:49.834
mobile home parks and pay rent

19:49.900 --> 19:54.133
on that land to the park owner.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.266
But in recent years, large

19:55.333 --> 19:56.266
investors have been snatching

19:56.333 --> 19:57.834
those parks up and either

19:57.900 --> 19:59.367
tearing them down or ratcheting

19:59.433 --> 20:00.667
up rent and fees, as these women

20:00.734 --> 20:03.100
experienced first-hand.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.433
The ingdol family decided to

20:04.500 --> 20:06.700
sell the park and they sold it

20:06.767 --> 20:09.467
to the Carlyle group.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.166
First of all, Carlyle started

20:11.233 --> 20:13.266
off with an immediate 8%

20:13.333 --> 20:14.800
increase in space rent, so that

20:14.867 --> 20:16.900
was a threat to most of us who

20:16.967 --> 20:18.600
are living on fixed income.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.533
I don't know what's gonna

20:20.600 --> 20:22.333
happen.

20:22.400 --> 20:22.834
I may be forced to leave

20:22.900 --> 20:23.300
everything.

20:23.367 --> 20:24.700
My doctors, my friends.

20:24.767 --> 20:25.734
The life I've known here.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.433
Even though I own my home.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.133
It's true.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.767
That woman may lose her home so

20:29.834 --> 20:31.333
the Carlyle group, an investment

20:31.400 --> 20:33.533
firm with $216 billion in

20:33.600 --> 20:35.734
assets, can make more money for

20:35.800 --> 20:38.667
shareholders.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.000
If the concept of "income

20:40.066 --> 20:41.600
inequality" came to life, that

20:41.667 --> 20:42.600
is the sentence it would scream

20:42.667 --> 20:45.000
when it orgasmed.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.333
Now, Carlyle... Carlyle insists

20:46.400 --> 20:48.066
the price hikes were to pay for

20:48.133 --> 20:49.367
park improvements... which makes

20:49.433 --> 20:51.233
complete sense.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.667
If you asked these fuckers why

20:52.734 --> 20:55.433
they got into private equity,

20:55.500 --> 20:56.400
I'm sure they'd say "to break

20:56.467 --> 20:57.734
even on investments in the

20:57.800 --> 20:59.033
beautification of affordable

20:59.100 --> 21:00.834
housing.

21:00.900 --> 21:06.934
Why else would we do this?"

21:07.000 --> 21:08.233
I also apparently have to tell

21:08.300 --> 21:10.734
you that they have a safety net

21:10.800 --> 21:12.934
program for low income

21:13.000 --> 21:13.934
residents, although it only

21:14.000 --> 21:16.567
applies for 81 of them, although

21:16.633 --> 21:19.500
it only attaches 3% of people,

21:19.567 --> 21:22.233
just like the one they use as my

21:22.300 --> 21:23.600
favorite circus, a pile of dead

21:23.667 --> 21:25.667
trapeze artists.

21:25.734 --> 21:26.967
It's fun for the whole family!

21:27.033 --> 21:27.600
Unless you're the family of one

21:27.667 --> 21:28.667
of those trapeze artists.

21:28.734 --> 21:29.767
And if you're thinking, "well

21:29.834 --> 21:30.367
look, that's terrible, but if

21:30.433 --> 21:31.333
those women live in mobile

21:31.400 --> 21:31.867
homes, why don't they just

21:31.934 --> 21:32.667
move?"

21:32.734 --> 21:34.100
There's a problem with that, as

21:34.166 --> 21:34.667
one of those women will tell

21:34.734 --> 21:35.133
you.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.567
Although they call them

21:36.633 --> 21:38.133
mobile homes, it would cost

21:38.200 --> 21:39.333
$20,000 to move this home out of

21:39.400 --> 21:45.800
here.

21:45.867 --> 21:46.467
Plus, it would... once you move

21:46.533 --> 21:47.700
them in and they settle, moving

21:47.767 --> 21:48.300
them out's gonna help destroy

21:48.367 --> 21:48.967
them.

21:49.033 --> 21:50.033
She's right.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.233
It can cost thousands of dollars

21:51.333 --> 21:52.367
to move mobile homes, if you can

21:52.433 --> 21:54.066
move them at all.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.033
That's why 80% of mobile homes

21:55.100 --> 21:56.600
never move.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.333
So mobile homes are mobile about

21:58.400 --> 21:59.367
as much as a king crab is

21:59.433 --> 22:02.600
actually a king.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.300
It's just not... except in some

22:04.367 --> 22:05.967
parts of Alaska, where it wields

22:06.033 --> 22:07.000
the power of a despot... but

22:07.066 --> 22:08.533
even then, it constitutionally

22:08.600 --> 22:09.066
shares power with

22:09.133 --> 22:11.166
moose parliament.

22:11.233 --> 22:13.834
So "king" is really a more

22:13.900 --> 22:14.233
ceremonial title.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.433
Alaska is a fascinating place.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.834
And this lack of mobility for

22:17.900 --> 22:19.266
tenants is actually part of the

22:19.333 --> 22:20.834
attraction for big investors.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.333
And to see just how cynical and

22:22.400 --> 22:25.000
predatory the industry can be,

22:25.066 --> 22:26.934
meet frank rolfe.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.967
His company is one of the

22:28.033 --> 22:29.633
largest park operators in the

22:29.700 --> 22:31.100
us, controlling over 30,000 home

22:31.166 --> 22:32.433
sites in 25 states.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.300
Rolfe is an evangelist for the

22:34.367 --> 22:35.734
wonders of mobile home park

22:35.800 --> 22:37.333
investing.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.667
Just look at this uplifting

22:38.734 --> 22:39.567
message that he made ahead of

22:39.633 --> 22:41.133
the 2012 election about what it

22:41.200 --> 22:42.233
would mean for his industry,

22:42.300 --> 22:43.266
taped, for some reason, in front

22:43.333 --> 22:44.967
of a shitty green screen oval

22:45.033 --> 22:46.667
office.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.266
If mitt romney wins, things

22:48.333 --> 22:54.567
are good.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.200
And if Barack Obama wins, things

22:56.266 --> 22:56.467
are good.

22:56.533 --> 22:57.400
You see, it doesn't much matter

22:57.467 --> 22:58.100
who wins the election.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.166
All that matters is that the

22:59.233 --> 23:00.567
statistics show that Americans

23:00.633 --> 23:01.633
will continue to get poorer in

23:01.700 --> 23:03.900
that lower half of the

23:03.967 --> 23:05.133
population.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.667
Wow.

23:07.734 --> 23:08.767
What president webcam is

23:08.834 --> 23:09.500
essentially saying there is,

23:09.567 --> 23:10.667
"no matter what happens, the

23:10.734 --> 23:11.333
poor will suffer, and we will

23:11.400 --> 23:13.066
feast on their rich marrow.

23:13.133 --> 23:14.033
And, as you can see, it's casual

23:14.100 --> 23:16.233
Friday here at the white house,

23:16.300 --> 23:17.533
which is why I sit before you

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
looking like a divorced dad at a

23:18.667 --> 23:23.266
parent-teacher conference."

23:23.333 --> 23:24.767
Rolfe is shameless about the

23:24.834 --> 23:25.633
degree to which his business

23:25.700 --> 23:27.133
depends on having a captive

23:27.200 --> 23:28.734
customer base, positively

23:28.800 --> 23:30.133
comparing it to running a

23:30.200 --> 23:31.467
waffle house where everyone is

23:31.533 --> 23:33.333
chained to the booths, a concept

23:33.400 --> 23:35.133
so deeply chilling, I think it

23:35.200 --> 23:35.967
may have just inspired

23:36.033 --> 23:41.934
Jordan peele's next movie.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.200
Now you should know, rolfe

23:43.266 --> 23:43.800
maintains that line was taken

23:43.867 --> 23:44.400
out of context.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.033
In fact, he has a whole page on

23:45.100 --> 23:45.934
his website about it, claiming

23:46.000 --> 23:46.800
he was just talking about the

23:46.867 --> 23:48.200
"incredibly consistent revenues"

23:48.266 --> 23:50.400
in mobile home parks.

23:50.467 --> 23:51.467
So he wasn't suggesting that

23:51.533 --> 23:52.667
he's a heartless person whose

23:52.734 --> 23:54.000
customers are stuck there with

23:54.066 --> 23:54.533
him holding all the cards

23:54.600 --> 23:55.667
deciding for himself how high he

23:55.734 --> 23:58.266
wants their rent to go.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.467
To see him say that, you'd need

23:59.533 --> 24:01.200
to enroll in his online

24:01.266 --> 24:02.800
mobile home university, which we

24:02.867 --> 24:03.633
did, and found seminars like

24:08.433 --> 24:09.233
What I've found, and again,

24:09.300 --> 24:13.300
just as a heartless person, is

24:13.367 --> 24:14.333
that, you know, the... the

24:14.400 --> 24:15.667
customers are stuck there.

24:15.734 --> 24:16.233
They don't have any option.

24:16.300 --> 24:16.834
They can't afford to move the

24:16.900 --> 24:17.867
trailer.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.367
They don't have three grand.

24:19.433 --> 24:20.000
So the only way they can... they

24:20.066 --> 24:20.834
can object to your rent raise is

24:20.900 --> 24:22.300
to walk off and leave the

24:22.367 --> 24:24.400
trailer, in which case it

24:24.467 --> 24:25.133
becomes abandoned property and

24:25.200 --> 24:26.133
you recycle it... put another

24:26.200 --> 24:27.200
person in it.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.266
So you really hold all the

24:28.333 --> 24:29.133
cards.

24:29.200 --> 24:29.767
So the question is, what do you

24:29.834 --> 24:30.767
want to do?

24:30.834 --> 24:31.500
How high do you want to go?

24:31.567 --> 24:32.500
Wow.

24:32.567 --> 24:33.233
Usually when someone is that

24:33.300 --> 24:34.200
contemptuous of poor people,

24:34.266 --> 24:37.133
they're immediately visited by

24:37.200 --> 24:37.734
the ghost of Christmas future.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.400
Now, maybe... maybe rolfe will

24:39.467 --> 24:40.700
claim that quote is out of

24:40.767 --> 24:41.934
context too, and that he's not

24:42.000 --> 24:43.700
arguing they're hostages.

24:43.767 --> 24:45.166
To hear him say that, you need

24:45.233 --> 24:46.266
to send away for rolfe's audio

24:46.333 --> 24:47.700
seminar on running mobile home

24:47.767 --> 24:49.233
parks, which we also did, and

24:49.300 --> 24:53.233
found this:

24:53.300 --> 24:54.500
One of the big drivers to

24:54.567 --> 24:55.734
making money is the ability to

24:55.800 --> 24:57.166
increase the rent.

24:57.233 --> 24:58.266
If we didn't have them hostage,

24:58.333 --> 24:59.333
if they weren't stuck in those

24:59.400 --> 25:01.066
homes in the mobile home lots,

25:01.133 --> 25:01.767
it would be a whole different

25:01.834 --> 25:02.667
picture.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.100
Frank rolfe's

25:04.166 --> 25:04.633
mobile home university is

25:04.700 --> 25:05.333
basically a crash course in how

25:05.400 --> 25:09.000
to be an asshole.

25:09.066 --> 25:09.800
Although having taken that

25:09.867 --> 25:10.533
course, I'd argue that if that's

25:10.600 --> 25:11.333
what you're looking for, save

25:11.400 --> 25:12.467
your money and just follow

25:12.533 --> 25:13.467
piers Morgan on Twitter for one

25:13.533 --> 25:18.200
afternoon.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.433
And, look, rolfe's course isn't

25:19.500 --> 25:21.233
just online.

25:21.300 --> 25:23.200
If you attend his mobile home

25:23.266 --> 25:24.433
boot camp, he'll even take you

25:24.500 --> 25:25.967
on a field trip tour of a park.

25:26.033 --> 25:26.533
When you get to the park,

25:26.600 --> 25:27.633
you'll be shocked and turned off

25:27.700 --> 25:28.800
by, for example, the beach towel

25:28.867 --> 25:29.967
in the window instead of an

25:30.033 --> 25:31.467
actual curtain.

25:31.533 --> 25:33.400
That doesn't mean anything.

25:33.467 --> 25:34.000
What you gotta worry about are

25:34.066 --> 25:35.567
the following items:

25:35.633 --> 25:36.967
Infrastructure, density,

25:37.033 --> 25:37.800
expense, age of home, and

25:37.867 --> 25:39.166
location.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.200
Got it?

25:40.266 --> 25:42.533
What's going on?

25:42.600 --> 25:43.867
They're teaching people about

25:43.934 --> 25:44.266
mobile home parks.

25:44.333 --> 25:44.767
Oh.

25:44.834 --> 25:45.633
Yeah.

25:45.700 --> 25:47.233
That's good.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.467
No, it isn't, though.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.800
It's really not good.

25:50.867 --> 25:51.400
Telling that woman people are

25:51.467 --> 25:52.367
just there to learn about

25:52.433 --> 25:53.567
mobile home parks is like

25:53.633 --> 25:54.800
telling a lobster people came to

25:54.867 --> 25:56.033
the restaurant to learn about

25:56.100 --> 25:57.934
crustacean habitats.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.300
"Oh!

25:59.367 --> 26:00.567
That's good!

26:00.633 --> 26:01.633
Are those knives and forks to

26:01.700 --> 26:02.333
help remove these tiny rubber

26:02.400 --> 26:03.300
bands from my claws?"

26:03.333 --> 26:04.233
No.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.834
They're going to eat you.

26:05.867 --> 26:07.133
So with that woman and many

26:07.200 --> 26:08.867
mobile home residents like her

26:08.967 --> 26:10.133
in danger of having their lives

26:10.233 --> 26:10.767
turned upside down, it is worth

26:10.867 --> 26:11.633
asking, is there anything that

26:11.700 --> 26:17.200
can be done here?

26:17.266 --> 26:18.166
Well, one potential solution is

26:18.233 --> 26:19.233
for residents to band together

26:19.300 --> 26:20.900
and buy their own park, keeping

26:20.967 --> 26:21.600
it out of the hands of

26:21.667 --> 26:22.633
speculators or developers.

26:22.700 --> 26:23.567
And while that sounds inherently

26:23.633 --> 26:24.967
like a long shot, there are

26:25.033 --> 26:25.567
nonprofit groups that have had

26:25.633 --> 26:26.633
real success in helping tenants

26:26.700 --> 26:28.300
get financing to do just that.

26:28.367 --> 26:29.500
What would help is to have laws

26:29.567 --> 26:30.834
in every state that give

26:30.900 --> 26:31.934
residents the right of first

26:32.000 --> 26:34.533
refusal and time to raise funds

26:34.600 --> 26:36.567
if the current owner plans to

26:36.633 --> 26:37.800
sell.

26:37.867 --> 26:38.867
But until laws like that are put

26:38.934 --> 26:40.900
in place, which there absolutely

26:40.967 --> 26:42.533
should be, there are some key

26:42.600 --> 26:43.800
If you

26:43.867 --> 26:44.633
want to rent a mobile home,

26:44.700 --> 26:46.066
fine.

26:46.133 --> 26:47.033
If you can afford to buy one and

26:47.100 --> 26:48.367
put it on land that you own,

26:48.433 --> 26:50.166
fine.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.600
But buying a mobile home and

26:51.667 --> 26:53.266
renting the land underneath it

26:53.333 --> 26:56.100
can be financially catastrophic.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.633
And it is very important that

26:57.700 --> 26:58.700
anyone considering doing that

26:58.767 --> 27:02.734
knows the risks involved.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.367
And I'll tell you what would've

27:03.433 --> 27:04.133
been helpful all along, if the

27:04.200 --> 27:05.633
marketing for these homes had

27:05.700 --> 27:11.367
always made those risks clear.

27:11.433 --> 27:12.400
You bought a mobile home?

27:13.700 --> 27:15.800
Today's manufactured home.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.967
You bought a house.

27:18.033 --> 27:19.133
I can't believe you bought a

27:19.200 --> 27:20.200
house.

27:20.266 --> 27:22.100
I really didn't.

27:22.166 --> 27:23.033
It's exactly like a house.

27:23.100 --> 27:23.934
And what a beautiful piece of

27:24.000 --> 27:24.800
land.

27:24.867 --> 27:25.600
I don't own the land though,

27:25.667 --> 27:26.667
and that's actually a super

27:26.734 --> 27:27.533
important difference.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.667
Look at you all grown up with a

27:31.734 --> 27:32.333
mortgage.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.700
It's a chattel loan with an

27:33.767 --> 27:35.433
astronomical interest rate.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.934
The important thing is, it's

27:37.000 --> 27:38.300
an investment in your future.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.967
It will actually only go down

27:41.033 --> 27:41.600
in value, and since a private

27:41.667 --> 27:42.633
equity firm brought the park, my

27:42.700 --> 27:44.367
rent has skyrocketed.

27:44.433 --> 27:45.600
Are you listening to me?

27:47.800 --> 27:49.066
Oh, I love these decorative

27:49.133 --> 27:50.633
bottles.

27:50.700 --> 27:55.700
Oh, that's my blood.

27:55.767 --> 28:00.967
I have to sell my blood and

28:01.033 --> 28:03.333
plasma in order to make

28:03.400 --> 28:03.967
loan payments.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.367
But home is where the

28:06.433 --> 28:07.400
sweet potato pie is.

28:07.467 --> 28:07.934
I didn't make that.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.100
Did you make that?

28:09.166 --> 28:10.200
Isn't that burning your hand?

28:10.266 --> 28:10.934
Are you a witch?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.333
I want to see your garden.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.133
No, no, don't go out there.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.133
There she is.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.767
Look, she can't afford to move.

28:19.834 --> 28:20.800
You hold all the

28:20.867 --> 28:21.266
cards.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.066
He's right.

28:24.133 --> 28:26.367
It's like a waffle house where I

28:26.433 --> 28:28.400
am chained to my booth.

28:28.467 --> 28:28.934
That sounds delicious.

28:29.000 --> 28:29.734
What is wrong with you?
