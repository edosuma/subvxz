[RuPaul] Previously
on All Stars...

01:14.308 --> 01:15.776
For this week's maxi challenge,

01:15.776 --> 01:19.079
you'll be making over
your Best Judy.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.280
[screaming]

01:20.280 --> 01:22.649
Family resemblance required.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.551
[cheering]

01:24.551 --> 01:26.186
[Manila] It's my husband.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.889
[gasps] I love it.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.093
Oh! No, it's good.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.595
Everything you've brought
so far has been so elaborate,

01:35.595 --> 01:38.131
and this is just
a little costume shop for me.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.833
You know, Latrice,
there's a disconnect

01:39.833 --> 01:41.134
with family resemblance.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.403
That is two different looks.
It really is.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.605
Monét X Change...

01:45.605 --> 01:48.175
Naomi Smalls...
Con-drag-ulations.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.478
You are the top two
All Stars of the week.

01:51.478 --> 01:54.247
The Best Judys
find themselves in the bottom.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.749
[Latrice] I love Manila,

01:55.749 --> 01:57.217
But if it comes down to--

01:57.217 --> 01:59.252
I'm not about
to sacrifice myself

01:59.252 --> 02:01.655
and say, oh, let me go home.
You stay.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.923
Girl, please.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.125
This is Manila's first time
in the bottom two.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.693
[Naomi] Seriously,
I love you so much

02:06.693 --> 02:08.128
and I look up to you so much.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.330
Naomi Smalls,

02:10.330 --> 02:13.533
which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

02:14.534 --> 02:15.769
Manila.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.971
Oh!

02:17.971 --> 02:20.907
Manila Luzon, sashay away.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.888
Oh, my God.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.494
Oh, we love and miss
Manila already.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.965
"Driver, kill it.
See you out there."

02:44.965 --> 02:46.433
Manila.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.703
Manila just went home, girl.
The choppery.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.072
She had three wins
under belt. Chopped.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.207
That is a gag. Ha!

02:54.207 --> 02:55.375
The goop.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.778
And I'm living for it.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.347
Tens across the board. Tens.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.648
That was wild.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.316
-It was. It was a bitch.
-[Monique] The goop.

03:03.316 --> 03:04.551
I feel guilty,

03:04.551 --> 03:06.019
'cause she was like
in the bottom.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.721
That was her first time ever
in the bottom,

03:07.721 --> 03:10.023
so that must be a gag feeling,
but...

03:10.023 --> 03:12.626
Why don't you erase this
and we can talk about it.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.794
-Got it.
-Yeah, quickly.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.695
Clearly this is
your first time, honey.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.231
I'm a rookie.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.267
Lean into it.
There you go.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.102
Aah!

03:22.102 --> 03:26.673
I have been giving my all
this entire time,

03:26.673 --> 03:29.843
and it feels good
to finally prove I am a threat

03:29.843 --> 03:31.745
and I can do more
than turn a look.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.581
I am such a good performer.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.117
Honestly, I really am.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.121
-Okay, I just got
to just get it all out.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.090
-Just get it out.
-Get it out, bitch.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.760
First of all,
I am like--I'm gagged

03:46.760 --> 03:48.662
-that Manila is gone.
-[Monique] The goopery.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.764
Like I was like this bitch

03:50.764 --> 03:53.200
was her first time
in the bottom,

03:53.200 --> 03:55.235
and she'd won
the most challenges.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
The goop.
No, bitch, we were...

03:57.237 --> 03:58.839
[Monét laughs]

03:58.839 --> 04:00.574
Manila deserves to be
in the competition,

04:00.574 --> 04:02.375
like so far to the end.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.510
According to her track record.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.845
Her track record.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.380
Girl, I'm just gagged.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.316
I definitely think
that up until now

04:09.316 --> 04:12.119
the eliminations
have been pretty fair.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.221
But now it's all out the window.

04:14.221 --> 04:18.492
I mean, girl, Manila
just got ran over, bitch.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.194
I just gotta get comfortable.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.562
[Naomi] Let's get serious.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.332
Okay, shady princess.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.733
Like what was your reasoning?

04:26.733 --> 04:29.035
[Naomi] I think
a lot of different reasons.

04:29.035 --> 04:32.739
Yes, Manila has been doing
so well in the competition,

04:32.739 --> 04:36.576
but I don't know if she
necessarily had my back.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.112
I sent Manila home
because..

04:39.112 --> 04:40.881
I wanted to.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.551
Manila was crazy competition,

04:44.551 --> 04:48.188
and that's dope, but...

04:48.188 --> 04:51.424
I decided to save Latrice
'cause I owe it to her.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.093
She saved my ass last week.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.362
If it looks shady, so be it.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.799
I have a close relationship
with you, so I chose you.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.500
Thank you so much.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.968
Thank you so much.
I love you, too.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.105
How do you feel
about Manila going home

05:05.105 --> 05:08.408
when she was a wreck
because she couldn't save you?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.410
And, bitch, we mean a wreck.
She was sobbing.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.878
Girl.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.914
Sashay away.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.448
Thank y'all.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.784
[applause]

05:17.784 --> 05:20.787
[sobs]

05:20.787 --> 05:23.290
I mean, like...

05:23.290 --> 05:25.525
You wanna win, bitch.
Fuck that. Say it.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.294
-No, I--
-Say that.

05:27.294 --> 05:32.499
But I really, really
saw her here with me

05:32.499 --> 05:34.134
through to the end,
you know what I mean?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.336
It comes down
to someone has to go,

05:36.336 --> 05:40.874
and if it's me or her,
like, you know,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.475
of course I want to stay.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.945
My love has never wavered
for her.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.981
I just--
We can't have it both ways.

05:47.981 --> 05:52.452
I want to know
who Monét picked.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.188
Yes, bitch. It's tax season.
Show the receipts.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.723
I chose Manila's ass, too.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.326
[all laugh and scream]

05:59.326 --> 06:01.494
Wow!

06:01.494 --> 06:03.863
Manila shaded me.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.799
[Manila] I'm sorry, girl.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.301
And even though we had resolved
it and we spoke,

06:08.301 --> 06:10.303
bitch, I'm a petty bitch
from Brooklyn.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.571
I hold onto grudges.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.140
-Damn! Damn!
-[Monique] #TeamPettyBitch.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.642
[Monét] I'm petty, girl.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.144
Manila played a shady game,
and it got her out, girl.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.680
Like, she was willing to
send me home to save her friend.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.716
so I am not hesitant to
show these girls this lipstick.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.817
I wish I would have
done it onstage.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.051
I would not have given
a backstory.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.654
No explanation.
Just my lipstick.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.089
[Trinity] Look, hold up. Okay.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.192
I'm just...I'm just like
all kinds of everywhere.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.095
I think that
you are living for this.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.863
She's living for it.
She's living for it.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.166
-Okay, no. No, listen.
-[Monét] She loves the drama.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.768
This is shady.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.037
This is some shade--
No, listen.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.106
Let me finish what I'm saying.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.108
You are a fucking shady bitch
for doing that.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.409
Why?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.077
And you're a fucking
shady bitch for doing that.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.947
But thank you so much.
[all laugh]

06:55.782 --> 06:59.085
I think we're realizing
that this competition now

06:59.085 --> 07:00.887
we're not going to be
judging it fairly.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.155
Because what's fair?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.456
Right.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.958
-Life's not fair.
-[Monét] Life's not fair.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.393
Get used to it.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.394
So, bitch, good luck
and you, you cross me,

07:07.394 --> 07:08.461
you going home next.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.531
I'm nervous. I'm nervous.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.467
Manila went home
because she was competition.

07:14.467 --> 07:18.138
And at this point,
I am tied with Monét

07:18.138 --> 07:19.973
for the most wins
in the competition.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.043
So, girl, I might be next
on the chopping block.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.878
Stunning!

07:24.878 --> 07:27.514
Wakeesha, carry your ass
to the grocery store

07:27.514 --> 07:29.416
and get me some tampons!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.451
I don't trust
none of these ho's.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.154
I mean, they sent Manila home.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.424
No one is safe.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.927
So the only way to be safe
is to be in the top.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.382
I've seen every episode
five times over.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.352
I'm always quoting it
with all my friends.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.087
I put a bird on my head.

12:01.087 --> 12:03.389
He couldn't even
get out the car.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.158
Are you guys ready
to go through the script?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.292
-[Latrice] Sure.
-[Trinity] Yeah.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.727
Let's do it.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.929
K-Jo, who's she?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.631
Now, I really don't know
a whole lot about the show,

12:11.631 --> 12:14.467
but I surely know that she
was not one of the main four.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.002
She's the friend
that came in as a mess.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.638
-She's an old party girl.
[Naomi] Yeah.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.939
I was still living at home
with my mom then.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.574
No, we didn't have cable.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.009
She didn't want me watching HBO

12:23.009 --> 12:25.278
'cause she didn't want me
to look at naked women.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.880
Maybe a boob or two
would have helped me, you know.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.282
I'm excited.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.684
I'll choose
Sarah Jessica Parker, SJP.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.586
Uh-uh.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.689
[Naomi] I'm gonna take
the biggest part for myself,

12:36.689 --> 12:39.092
because at this point
in the competition,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.461
everyone here is trying to win
just like me.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.297
Then I'm trying to show
the judges that I am here,

12:44.297 --> 12:46.466
I am present, I deserve a crown.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.401
So I have to play it to win.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.203
I wanna be K-Jo.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.238
-I would love Kim.
-I would love Kim, as well.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.541
Is there a reason why
one of you guys would love Kim?

12:55.541 --> 12:56.709
I just feel like I--

12:56.709 --> 13:01.147
'Cause I'm the older,
slutty, sexy one.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.383
I don't know much
about Sex and the City,

13:03.383 --> 13:07.920
but I really want Kim
because I relate to the role.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.690
Kim is a cougar.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.191
She's still sleeping
with everybody.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.294
That is me in...

13:15.294 --> 13:17.063
30 years, bitch.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.431
I want Kim.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.199
[Trinity] Girl, me, too.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.202
I feel like I can be
very slutty as well,

13:23.202 --> 13:26.606
and also, I just feel like
my voice lends itself to Kim.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.274
I feel like
that's what's calling me.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.343
Yeah, she does
kind of sound, you know...

13:30.343 --> 13:31.611
-[Monét] Right.
-Mannish.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.912
Very.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.447
I love Sex and the City.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.115
It's one of
my favorite shows to watch.

13:36.115 --> 13:40.019
And I know I can do
a better Kim than Trinity.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.155
Her pacing and the way
she speaks, you know,

13:42.155 --> 13:46.693
it's very mm, oh, hmm, oh.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.528
You're comfortable playing
anybody else?

13:48.528 --> 13:49.962
No, I'm comfortable
playing Kim.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.464
[laughs]

13:51.464 --> 13:53.166
We could flip a coin.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.333
Rock, scissor, paper.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.402
[Latrice] It's a challenge.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.537
Rock, paper, scissors?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.305
Yeah, rock, paper,
scissors over this.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.307
Girl, all I know is

14:01.307 --> 14:03.309
there's a bunch of snakes
in here,

14:03.309 --> 14:06.145
and the only way to stay
in this competition for me

14:06.145 --> 14:09.682
is to be in the top this week.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.486
And I think Kim
is my best chance to win.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.854
Best two out of three.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.955
Okay.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.056
-Okay, best out of three.
Here we go.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.633
Y'all two gotta duke it out.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.368
Rock, paper, scissors?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.536
-Best two out of three?
-[Trinity] Okay.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.705
Okay, best two out of three.
Here we go.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.307
[both laugh]

14:34.307 --> 14:36.776
Today's maxi challenge
is to act in the mockumentary

14:36.776 --> 14:39.645
about the making of the
Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3.

14:39.645 --> 14:43.883
And Trinity wants Kim Cattrall,
and, bitch, I want Kim Cattrall.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.352
So the only way to decide, girl,
is rock, paper, scissors.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.554
One, two, three, shoot.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.890
-Okay, that's one. 1-0.
-Okay.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.759
One, two, three, shoot.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.093
Boom, 1-1. Aah!

14:54.093 --> 14:55.695

14:55.695 --> 14:57.830
One, two, three, shoot.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.799
Aah!

14:59.799 --> 15:02.135
One, two, three, shoot.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.537
-Aah!
-I'm it.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.205
I get Kim. I get Kim.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.340
I thought
you were going with paper.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.408
-Candy wrapper.
-[Monét] I know.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.745
Bitch, I can't take it.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.181
-Monique, you'll be K-Jo.
-K-Jo.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.016
-Latrice, you'll be Cynthia.
-Okay.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.452
I will be playing SJP.
You'll be Kim.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.689
So who's the nice, like,
pretty sensitive girl?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.658
That's gonna be Monét
playing Kristin.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.593
[Naomi laughs]

15:27.593 --> 15:30.263
Why'd your face
change like that?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.098
I don't see her being dainty.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.566
It's an acting challenge.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.201
I'm an actress.
Let's go.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.870
I really, really want Kim,

15:37.870 --> 15:39.138
but I know all these characters
really well,

15:39.138 --> 15:41.574
so I'm going to slay
this challenge

15:41.574 --> 15:43.543
no matter who I play.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.846
Please don't say it.
We're about to eat.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.749
Your girl is a contender.
Amen.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.621
How do you like
your character?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.423
I didn't get a chance
to read her whole description,

15:57.423 --> 15:58.791
but now I see what
she's supposed to be doing.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.826
She sounds lesbian.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.894
-She is a lesbian.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.263

lesbian turned politician.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.137
I'm kind of getting into it.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.606
I'm like I'm reading
the backstory of her,

16:13.606 --> 16:16.142
and I'm like, okay,
I can be this girl.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.977
I just have to make it my own.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.979
I have big news, too.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.380
We all know you're gay.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.649
Not that.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.585
I'm running for office.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.619

16:26.619 --> 16:29.689

for years.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.699
Hiya, skanks. What?

16:39.699 --> 16:42.568
You look like
you just seen a ghost.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.774
I have a long history
of acting, in the church plays.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.143
Anybody else grew up like me
in the Easter cantata,

16:51.143 --> 16:55.314
the Christmas play, trying
to look like Jesus or Moses.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.949
Didn't you die

16:56.949 --> 16:59.118
when you fell out of the window
of the penthouse 15 years ago?

16:59.118 --> 17:02.288
Nope. I was just in a coma.

17:02.288 --> 17:06.192
Also, I've acted on stage
in the school auditorium.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.028
Um...
[crickets chirp]

17:09.028 --> 17:10.997
I mean, that's about it.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.904
I don't know
if they want to do

17:17.904 --> 17:20.606
like the twitch
the entire thing. Right?

17:20.606 --> 17:22.341
[Latrice] Wow.

17:22.341 --> 17:24.410
She has some strange ideas.

17:24.410 --> 17:29.649
I was like, yeah, do that.
Please, do that.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.951

Cut!
Naomi, your energy is good.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.670
I just don't want you
to push too hard.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.240
You know, SJP, she's kind of
just kind of sweet.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.076
-Okay.
-You know. Got it?

19:04.076 --> 19:07.880
Anna Wintour
is finally stepping down

19:07.880 --> 19:10.316
as the editor-in-chief
of Vogue.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.518
Cut. You're a little,
you know, a little off.

19:12.518 --> 19:16.122
She's more like perky,
because this is what she loves.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.156
Okay.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.225
And still find
a little more subtlety.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.394
-Okay.
-We're gonna get there.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.597
[Trinity] Girl, I'm waiting for
Naomi to give me some SJP,

19:24.597 --> 19:28.067
but all I'm getting is...
[whispers] Club 96.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.404
Let's talk about
female fashion issue.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.406
All right, cut.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.542
So, Naomi, female issues,
female fashions.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.812
Can we please stop
talking about female issues

19:39.812 --> 19:42.615
and start talking
about fashion issues?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.517
[Ross] Okay, cut.

19:44.517 --> 19:48.821
Let's talk about
female fashion issues.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.891
Cut. Enough female issues.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.793
This movie needs
more female fashion.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.194
-Female fashion.
-[Ross] You got it?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.496
Female issues, female fashion.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.098
It's a lot of lines.
I get it.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.234
As a proud mother

20:02.234 --> 20:05.471
of a daughter of color,
and...

20:05.471 --> 20:06.806
[Ross] Take it again.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.775
You know, as a proud mother
of a daughter of color

20:09.775 --> 20:11.610
and a newly converted Jewess,

20:11.610 --> 20:15.181

should be solid black.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.385
-Have fun with it.
-Okay.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.053
Okay? Because
we're wanting more.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.422
Don't say it!
We're about to eat.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.491
Cut, cut, cut.
Okay, great.

to the next scene.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.894
Ooh!

20:28.894 --> 20:31.063
All right, so we're gonna
be cutting from the movie.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.898
This is now you're being
the actors, right?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.767
-Okay.
-Scripts are hidden.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.402
Duncan's going to say cut,
you'll pull the scripts out.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.970
-Okay?
-Right.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.039
[Ross] I think I would love to
even see your posture change.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.407
Cut. Okay.
You know what I mean?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.908
Almost like
you let your belly out.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.243
Just a subtle, like, character
shift, you know what I mean?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.244
Okay.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.879
[Duncan] That's a cut.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.483
Oh. Oh, thank God.
I have notes.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.686
Why do I have to be...

20:53.686 --> 20:54.987
I'm sorry. Line?

20:54.987 --> 20:57.623
Why do I have to do
all the sex scenes?

20:57.623 --> 21:00.593
Okay.
And why do I have to...

21:00.593 --> 21:03.462
Cut. I need you
to get that line, Trinity.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.564
-Sorry.
-Action.

21:05.564 --> 21:09.468
It says in my script
I'm supposed to...fuck a duck.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.370
Seriously?
[Ross] Cut.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.273
Okay, Trinity, I'm going
to take you Kim Cattrall 101.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.175
Can you go low
on "seriously?"

21:16.175 --> 21:17.510
Seriously?

21:17.510 --> 21:19.345
No. Kim Cattrall
goes "seriously."

21:19.345 --> 21:21.714
-She does.
-[all laugh]

21:21.714 --> 21:24.350
Okay. All right.
A real duck?

21:24.350 --> 21:25.684
Seriously?

21:28.420 --> 21:32.358
Trinity is blowing it.
[laughs]

21:32.358 --> 21:34.493
Action.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.896
Hiya, skanks.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.964
-[Latrice] Oh.
-What?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.300
You look like you just seen
a ghost or something.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.735
[chuckles]

21:42.735 --> 21:44.570
Does anybody have
a charger for my flip phone?

21:44.570 --> 21:47.106
And then it's the pause.
Oh, sorry.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.307
[Ross] All right, cut!

21:48.307 --> 21:51.010
-Great energy when you came in.
-Okay.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.879
Monét, I think
you are so bothered by K-Jo.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.114
She's so annoying.
She's a mess.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.515
Got it.

21:56.515 --> 21:59.084
Didn't you die when you fell
out the penthouse window?

21:59.084 --> 22:02.421
Nope. Just in a coma.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.591
I woke up
about an hour ag-ago.

22:05.591 --> 22:09.628
[all laugh]

22:11.230 --> 22:13.666
Don't put that in.
Take care of that in post.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.833
It was actually--

22:14.833 --> 22:17.670
[all laugh]

22:17.670 --> 22:19.071
[Latrice] Girl.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.940
Girl,
this bitch is suffering

22:20.940 --> 22:22.474
from chronic wig loss syndrome.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.577
And there ain't no pill,
there ain't no shot,

22:24.577 --> 22:26.445
and it's only given anally.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.013
Can I smoke in here?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.014
No.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.619
[coughs]

22:33.619 --> 22:35.087
[Ross] Cut. Okay.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.957
I don't know that
we need you guys coughing

22:37.957 --> 22:40.826
and smoking a cigarette
if we never lit it. Okay?

22:40.826 --> 22:42.695
So I think you look for a light.
Oh, I can't smoke it?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.897
-It's not lit, okay?
-Got it. Sorry.

22:44.897 --> 22:45.931
No, don't be sorry.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.368
The church play type,
you know, actor.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.669
[chuckles]

22:50.669 --> 22:52.938
So what happened
with you and Mr. Big?

22:52.938 --> 22:54.173
Finally.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.742
Oh, I meant, I thought
you'd never ask.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.010
[Latrice] Mr. Big?

22:58.010 --> 23:01.647
Why does every conversation
have to do with men?

23:01.647 --> 23:03.015
-I mean, seriously.
-I mean--

23:03.015 --> 23:04.450
Sorry.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.619
The future is female,
and if--

23:06.619 --> 23:08.454
If you step on my line
one more time...

23:08.454 --> 23:10.823
[all laugh]

23:13.826 --> 23:15.394
Sorry.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.562
Let's just get through it
before we cut.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.864
-It's almost there, okay?
-[laughs]

23:18.864 --> 23:20.199
It's good.
I promise you.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.971
Whoo!

23:25.971 --> 23:27.239
-Giddyup.
-Whoo.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.641
Aah!

23:28.641 --> 23:31.176
Save a horse,
ride a hillbilly.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.411
[all laugh]

23:32.411 --> 23:36.081
Oh, my God.
This is the big day.

23:36.081 --> 23:40.753
Whoo, today's runway
is kitty cat couture,

23:40.753 --> 23:44.523
and today's elimination is
the last one before the finale,

23:44.523 --> 23:46.558
where somebody's
gonna get the crown.

23:46.558 --> 23:47.993
And that's a lot of pressure.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.361
You had
a lot of fucking lines.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.362
I had a lot of lines.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.664
You had lines
the house down,

23:51.664 --> 23:52.731
but you knew them.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.600
[Naomi]
But I feel like I had

23:54.600 --> 23:56.168
one of the best understanding
of my lines.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.303
-[Monét] Oh, absolutely.
-Going in there.

23:57.303 --> 23:58.404
Totally.

23:58.404 --> 24:01.440
Girl, I hear y'all over there

24:01.440 --> 24:04.310
trying to make something happen
that ain't gonna happen.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.946
[all laugh]

24:07.946 --> 24:09.448
-I'm very proud
of my performance

24:09.448 --> 24:10.783
in Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.652
I took the lead role,
who had the most lines.

24:13.652 --> 24:18.824
It was a risk, and I hope
that it doesn't send me home.

24:18.824 --> 24:19.825
You were so Kristin.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.594
-I wouldn't say that.
-Yeah.

24:22.594 --> 24:24.296
You don't even know the show.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.732
She's the prissy white bitch.
You didn't give me that.

24:26.732 --> 24:30.202
A lot of mine
was in the nuances that I did.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.171
[laughs]

24:32.171 --> 24:33.238
[Monét] Like, like, like, like--

24:33.238 --> 24:35.441
-You know what you do?
Failed nuance.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.709
[all laugh]

24:36.709 --> 24:39.044
Nu-ance.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.981
When I can make myself laugh,
like, I know it's funny.

24:41.981 --> 24:46.218
And yesterday inside,
I was like... [laughs].

24:46.218 --> 24:49.054
So it's gonna be
really interesting

24:49.054 --> 24:50.789
to see what happens
on the runway.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.658
Ross came for you, Trinity.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.059
I don't know
how to feel about it.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.294
Well, here's the thing.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.296
Because Trinity
wanted Kim Cattrall--

24:57.296 --> 24:59.264
That's what I wanted
to ask you, Monét.

24:59.264 --> 25:01.633
Do you feel like you could have
did a better job than Trinity?

25:01.633 --> 25:03.335
-I do.
-Oh.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.471
-That's not shade.
-[Latrice] No, girl.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.573
I'm just shocked
to hear you say yes.

25:07.573 --> 25:09.775
Well, because also,
I'm like a huge fan,

25:09.775 --> 25:11.910
like, I've seen every season.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.445
But, girl, just because
you're a huge fan of the show

25:13.445 --> 25:15.347
don't mean you'll do the--

25:15.347 --> 25:17.449
But I know her isms, and I
know, like, like, I sometimes--

25:17.449 --> 25:20.052
But I felt like
I was doing the isms.

25:20.052 --> 25:25.224
I sit with my friends
and I, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.794
[Trinity] Girl, Monét is being
a bitter Betty, bitch.

25:28.794 --> 25:32.030
"Oh, girl, I know this show."

25:32.030 --> 25:33.232
Bitch, we'll see.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.933
It's elimination day.

25:34.933 --> 25:39.471
The stress of like having
to like pick one of you

25:39.471 --> 25:42.174
if I'm in the top,
you know, and win,

25:42.174 --> 25:44.843
that's the part
I'm not looking forward to.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.846
[Trinity] If I am in the top,

25:47.846 --> 25:51.383
I really am genuinely
going to try

25:51.383 --> 25:55.220
to make the fairest
possible decision

25:55.220 --> 25:57.523
based off of track record.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.191
I'm hearing all this
report card bullshit,

25:59.191 --> 26:01.293
and like I'm looking at
who I feel

26:01.293 --> 26:03.529
-would represent this legacy--
-I agree.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.532
And actually have a platform
and use it for good

26:06.532 --> 26:10.702
and not for like self-indulgent
music videos, a new T-shirt.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.405
That's bullshit.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.274
So I want somebody
standing up there next to me

26:15.274 --> 26:17.342
who's looking at
the bigger picture

26:17.342 --> 26:19.878
of what this competition
really means and stands for.

26:19.878 --> 26:23.882
And that is my sermonette
for the day.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.385
[Naomi] It's real easy to talk
about it before it happens--

26:26.385 --> 26:27.519
That's very true.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.221
[Naomi] But when you're
in that moment,

26:29.221 --> 26:30.923
everything goes out the window.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.658
I know
it would make great television

26:32.658 --> 26:34.226
if Trinity got voted off.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.295
[Latrice] Ooh!

26:36.295 --> 26:38.063
Oh, please don't say that
and put that in the universe.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.666
Don't hate the player, bitch.
Hate the game.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.942

Welcome to the main stage of
RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.167
Michelle Visage,
now, is it true

27:15.167 --> 27:16.768
you turned down the lead role

27:16.768 --> 27:19.037
in the original
Sex and the City?

27:19.037 --> 27:20.639
Uh, close.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.674
I was offered the lead role
in another movie

27:22.674 --> 27:24.409
called Sex and the Titties.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.111
Oh, yeah.

27:26.111 --> 27:27.779
Oh, my God,
you're perfect for that.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.449
-Scheduling conflict and, yeah.
-[RuPaul] Yeah.

27:30.449 --> 27:34.219
And Hollywood's hottest
and most affordable director,

27:34.219 --> 27:35.354
Ross Mathews.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.222
Ru, I love directing so much.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.791
I felt like Clint Beastwood.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.393
[all laugh]

27:41.393 --> 27:44.663
That's funny, because you look
more like a Steven Squealberg.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.131
Cut!

27:46.131 --> 27:47.799
[all laugh]

27:47.799 --> 27:52.137
A fashion designer whose
clients include Michelle Obama,

27:52.137 --> 27:56.909
Julianne Moore, and the new
RuPaul doll, Jason Wu.

27:56.909 --> 27:57.910
Hi, doll.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.912
You look gorgeous,
both of you.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.114
I feel plastic.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.616
Just 99%.

28:04.616 --> 28:08.353
And an award-winning actress
of the stage and screen,

28:08.353 --> 28:11.023
the incredible Felicity Huffman.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.891
Hi, Ru.
You know, it's a fun fact.

28:12.891 --> 28:15.360
I actually beat out Michelle
for the lead

28:15.360 --> 28:17.362
in that film Sex and the
Titties, and it was actually

28:17.362 --> 28:19.698
some of the most rewarding work
of my career.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.966
Uh-huh.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.869
Well, I bet you had
to dig deep for that one.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.071
Oh, Ru, you have no idea.

28:26.071 --> 28:29.808
[all laugh]

28:29.808 --> 28:31.476
This week,
we challenged our queens

28:31.476 --> 28:33.312
to star in a mockumentary

28:33.312 --> 28:36.715
about the making
of Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.285
On the runway,
category is cat couture.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.321
-Meow.
-Ladies and gentlemen,

28:42.321 --> 28:46.425
start your engines,
and may the best All Star win.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.963
♪ She's a super queen,
super queen ♪

28:52.331 --> 28:54.967
[RuPaul]
First up, Trinity The Tuck.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.401
[Michelle] She's a cheetah.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.770
[Jason] I think this tiger's
from New Jersey, right?

28:58.770 --> 29:01.239
[Ross] Oh, my God,
I'm so star-struck.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.741
I love her cheese puffs.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.009
[RuPaul laughs]

29:04.009 --> 29:07.312
[Trinity] Bitch,
my cat couture is fierce.

29:07.312 --> 29:10.015
I am feeling my pussy.

29:10.015 --> 29:14.386
She is sleek, tight-fitting,
and she purrs.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.055
Rrr. Meow. [hiss]

29:17.055 --> 29:19.458
[RuPaul] Now that's
what I call a meowchfit.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.826
[Michelle] Yes.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.161
Her leopard brings
all the spots to the yard.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.365
[all laugh]

29:26.365 --> 29:28.066

29:30.736 --> 29:33.205
[RuPaul] Where there's smoke,
there's a pussy on fire.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.806
-[Michelle] A pink pussy?
-[RuPaul] Mm.

29:34.806 --> 29:35.974
[Jason] I think
it's one of the Pokémon.

29:35.974 --> 29:37.209
I think I should
try to catch it.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.511
[Michelle] Jigglypuff.
[all laugh]

29:39.511 --> 29:42.714
[Monét] I'm giving you
pink pussy panther fierceness.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.549
I feel sexy.
I feel sultry.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.653
I feel like this is like
the Pink Panther come to life,

29:47.653 --> 29:50.922
and she grew up in Harlem
on Lexington and 123rd, okay?

29:50.922 --> 29:53.725
She is a pink panther,
and I feel good.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.327
[RuPaul] Pink Panther
on the runway.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.096
[Felicity] It looks like
a sex toy in a person.

29:58.096 --> 29:59.431
[RuPaul] I'll take two.
[all laugh]

29:59.431 --> 30:00.966
[Jason]
I can see her cat nips.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.735
[Michelle] Meow, meow.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.471
[RuPaul] Latrice Royale.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.674
[Ross]
Behold the lion queen.

30:08.674 --> 30:10.442
[RuPaul] Oh, she's serving
that jungle fever.

30:10.442 --> 30:15.347
♪ If she were queen
of the forest ♪

30:15.347 --> 30:17.816
[Latrice] I'm the queen
of the jungle, honey.

30:17.816 --> 30:22.087
I have this gorgeous
air-brushed safari dress.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.522
Hair is to the gods,

30:23.522 --> 30:26.024
honey blondes
and crimped and braids.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.193
Just giving you lion safari.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.562
[laughs]
And I feel beautiful.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.432
[Michelle]
Atilier Roberto Safari.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.667
-[RuPaul] Safari so goody.
-[Michelle] Yes.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.769
[Ross] Do you really like it
or are you just lion?

30:37.769 --> 30:38.770
[all laugh]

30:38.770 --> 30:40.539
[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.808
Cou-tens across the board.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.309
[Michelle] Guys, is that
a skein on her dress?

30:44.309 --> 30:45.477
[laughs]

30:45.477 --> 30:47.512
Thank you.
That's a yarn joke. Thank you.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.415
[Jason] I'd love to play
with her yarn balls, though.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.150
[Naomi] This cat couture look

30:52.150 --> 30:56.455
is my pastel take
on a modern-day cat lady.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.424
She sits at home
with her feline friends,

30:59.424 --> 31:02.627
because who needs a boyfriend
when you look this fabulous?

31:02.627 --> 31:05.297
[Ross] So cats have nine lives,
and she has three cats.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.567
So carry the one...it's like
a thousand and something.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.303
[Michelle] Yes.
This is a fancy feast.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.038
[all laugh]

31:13.038 --> 31:14.639
[RuPaul] Monique Heart.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.442
[Michelle] Those boots
are grrrrrreat!

31:17.442 --> 31:19.678
[all laugh]

31:19.678 --> 31:20.946
[Jason] We call that
a puss in hooker boots?

31:20.946 --> 31:24.449
[Michelle] Yes.
[all laugh]

31:24.449 --> 31:25.584
[Monique] My cat couture look

31:25.584 --> 31:27.786
is inspired
by Puss in Boots.

31:27.786 --> 31:32.023
It is a cat leotard,
airbrushed, custom colored,

31:32.023 --> 31:35.727
lightly sprinkled
with some rhinestones.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.231
And these boots? Ridiculous.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.032
They are what? Pussy.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.401
[RuPaul] No, she's a Puss
in Boots and a Cat in a Hat.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.703
[all laugh]

31:44.703 --> 31:47.572
[Michelle] Rum Tum Tucker.
[all laugh]

31:47.572 --> 31:50.375
♪ She's a super queen ♪

31:51.743 --> 31:53.245
Welcome, All Stars.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.815
-Meow.
-Meow.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.284
-Grrr.
[all laugh]

31:59.284 --> 32:02.087
It's time
for the world debut

32:02.087 --> 32:03.889
of your mockumentary.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.226
[Announcer]
When it was announced

32:08.226 --> 32:09.294
that the most
beloved characters

32:09.294 --> 32:10.695
in the history of the world

32:10.695 --> 32:12.798
were reuniting
for one final film,

32:12.798 --> 32:15.500
Hollywood predicted
box office gold.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.870
As the star
and executive producer,

32:18.870 --> 32:20.906
I had the great responsibility

32:20.906 --> 32:22.541
to celebrate female friendship

32:22.541 --> 32:26.011
by bringing my sister actors
back together.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.813
Who wouldn't love that,
right?

32:27.813 --> 32:30.448
[Announcer] But not everyone
was on the same page.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.884
I never wanted
to do this movie.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.820
I've been very clear.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.221
In fact, I literally said,

32:36.221 --> 32:40.125
"I do not want to do
this movie."

32:40.125 --> 32:41.827
[Announcer] This is
the Ru Hollywood Story

32:41.827 --> 32:43.995
of Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3,

32:43.995 --> 32:46.531
the shequel
that was never meant to be.

32:46.531 --> 32:50.001
Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3,
take one.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.639
Well, ladies, were here.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.509
We are brunching
at our favorite place.

32:57.509 --> 32:58.977
Guess what?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.414
Anna Wintour
is finally stepping down

33:02.414 --> 33:04.850
as the editor-in-chief
of Vogue.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.384
No.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.453
And guess who's in line
for the position.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.722
That's great.
You know, as a proud mother

33:10.722 --> 33:12.624
of a daughter of color

33:12.624 --> 33:14.292
and a newly converted Jewess,

33:14.292 --> 33:17.629
I think that your first cover
should be solid black.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.232
You know, to challenge
white patriarchy.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.334
By the way, where the heck
is the waiter?

33:22.334 --> 33:25.604
Ha! He's buttering
my muffin.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.573
And by that,
I mean he's under the table.

33:28.573 --> 33:30.542
[both gasp]

33:30.542 --> 33:34.346
His name's Larry,
but I like to call him Lawrence.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.914
Lawrence of my labia.

33:35.914 --> 33:38.617
Please don't say it.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.385
We're about to eat.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.653
I have big news, too.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.822
Something I've been wanting
to tell you all

33:43.822 --> 33:45.090
for such a long time.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.259
It's okay.
We all know you're gay.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.994
Not that.

33:48.994 --> 33:51.329
I'm running for office!

33:51.329 --> 33:52.797
Oh!
[applause]

33:52.797 --> 33:55.934
It's about time you got
your ballet box stuffed.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.104
What? Once you start
making sex puns,

33:59.104 --> 34:01.973
it's hard to stop.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.976
Guess who I ran into
on the subway.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.144
Mr. Big.

34:06.144 --> 34:07.379
That reminds me.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.081
I need to fix New York's
crumbling subway system.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.484
Speaking of worn-out tunnels,

34:12.484 --> 34:16.187
vaginal dryness is a big problem
with women in their sixties,

34:16.187 --> 34:19.558
so I'm launching
my own feminine lubricant

34:19.558 --> 34:22.294
called "Slickity Split."

34:22.294 --> 34:24.963
Cut. Cut.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.899
Any shameless plugging
has to go through me.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.067
Shameless?

34:29.067 --> 34:32.304
My tits are all over
this franchise,

34:32.304 --> 34:34.339
and you've never even
taken off your bra.

34:34.339 --> 34:39.144
She who shall not be named
has always been a challenge.

34:39.144 --> 34:42.247
In my script, it says
I'm supposed to fuck a duck.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.750
A real duck?

34:45.750 --> 34:46.918
Seriously?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.286
Ladies, can we get along?

34:48.286 --> 34:49.821
I mean, we're stronger together.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.222
I mean, really.

34:51.222 --> 34:52.590
Where'd she go?

34:52.590 --> 34:53.658
[gasps]

34:57.429 --> 35:00.298
"I'm sorry. I can't.
I hate you."

35:00.298 --> 35:02.434
Did she just break up with us
on a Post-it note?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.436
Oh, no, she better don't.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.073
If there's one thing I learned
playing Annie on Broadway

35:08.073 --> 35:11.376
is that at a certain age,
everyone's replaceable.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.178
[Announcer]
So executive producer SJP

35:13.178 --> 35:15.814
asked an old guest star
to drop in.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.849
[K-Jo] Cowabunga!

35:17.849 --> 35:19.851
Oh!

35:22.187 --> 35:23.621
Hiya, skanks.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.923
Oh!

35:24.923 --> 35:26.257
Wait. Really?

35:26.257 --> 35:29.227
She was in one episode
in the entire series.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.595
You look like
you just seen a ghost.

35:30.595 --> 35:31.730
[Kristin] Didn't you die

35:31.730 --> 35:33.598
when you feel out of the window
of the penthouse

35:33.598 --> 35:35.133
15 years ago?

35:35.133 --> 35:38.003
Nope. Just in a coma.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.271
I woke up about an hour ago.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.741
Does anyone have a charger
for my flip phone?

35:42.741 --> 35:43.908
Flip phone?

35:43.908 --> 35:45.243
Welcome back.

35:45.243 --> 35:49.514
We really needed a fun member
to fill this foursome.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.449
Ah, yeah, whatever.

35:51.449 --> 35:52.984
Can I smoke in here?

35:52.984 --> 35:55.387
Who says I'm not fun?

35:55.387 --> 35:57.422
Is this because I'm a lesbian?

35:57.422 --> 35:58.590
You know, I used to be

35:58.590 --> 36:01.359
New York City's
number one party girl.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.927
But I learned my lesson.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.397
Now, who has the blow?

36:05.397 --> 36:08.700
Shh! We don't really
do that anymore, okay?

36:08.700 --> 36:11.002
You know, whatever happened
to you and Mr. Big, anyway?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.771
Mr. Big.

36:12.771 --> 36:16.474
Why does every conversation
end up being about men?

36:16.474 --> 36:18.977
The future is female.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.378
It certainly was last night.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.147
Holla.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.082
I mean, can we please address
the double standards

36:24.082 --> 36:25.250
when it comes to nudity?

36:25.250 --> 36:26.885
It's about gender justice.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.553
Come on, say it with me, ladies.

36:28.553 --> 36:30.722
Free the nipple!

36:30.722 --> 36:32.757
Oh, cut!

36:32.757 --> 36:34.959
[Announcer] It turns out
that unscripted nudity

36:34.959 --> 36:37.262
was more than SJP could bare.

36:37.262 --> 36:40.865
We need to please stop
talking about female issues.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.235
This movie
needs more female fashion.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.276
So after all this
clowning around,

36:51.276 --> 36:53.011
I couldn't help but wonder,

36:53.011 --> 36:54.712
as editor of Vogue,

36:54.712 --> 36:57.449
what was going to be the theme
of my first Met Ball?

36:57.449 --> 36:58.550
[gasps]

37:01.753 --> 37:03.521
Hiya.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.956
Do you like my look?

37:04.956 --> 37:08.126
It's Dolce & Gabbozo.

37:08.126 --> 37:11.129
Listen,
if it's gonna help me snag

37:11.129 --> 37:13.765
the all-important
clown vote, why not?

37:13.765 --> 37:17.302
Can I smoke in here?

37:17.302 --> 37:21.806
Well, if it isn't
the insane clown posse.

37:21.806 --> 37:25.677
Get a load
of my insane clown pussy.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.213
Cut. You?

37:28.213 --> 37:30.115
What are you doing here?

37:30.115 --> 37:33.051
I couldn't resist
a clown theme.

37:33.051 --> 37:37.188
I mean, who doesn't love
a big top?

37:37.188 --> 37:38.456
Ugh.

37:38.456 --> 37:40.892
Oops. I did it again.

37:40.892 --> 37:41.960
[gasps]

37:41.960 --> 37:43.228
Well, you know what?

37:43.228 --> 37:45.530
I'm going to be
the better person.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.031
Come here.

37:47.031 --> 37:48.733
Oh.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.603
[honk]

37:51.603 --> 37:53.705
-Oh!
-Oh!

37:53.705 --> 37:54.772
[SJP] Oops.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.642
That was real knee-slapper.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.377
-Oh!
[Kim] Oops.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.479
That wasn't your knee.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.114
Hey, hey, hey.
Clown-on-clown violence

38:03.114 --> 38:04.149
is no laughing matter.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.717
Oh!

38:05.717 --> 38:08.086
Girls, when they go low,

38:08.086 --> 38:11.156
we go pie.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.423
[laughs]

38:12.423 --> 38:14.626
-Oh!
[K-Jo] Ha!

38:14.626 --> 38:16.694
She's clown roadkill!

38:16.694 --> 38:19.030
Aah!

38:22.367 --> 38:24.102
[SJP] And there we were,

38:24.102 --> 38:26.371
red-nosed and red-faced

38:26.371 --> 38:29.140
in our own little
three-ring circus.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.409
[Kristin] You know,
Anne Frank once said,

38:31.409 --> 38:34.345
"in spite of everything,
people are truly good at heart."

38:34.345 --> 38:36.915
Or was that Cardi B?

38:36.915 --> 38:38.183
[Cynthia]
When women come together,

38:38.183 --> 38:41.286
they can do important
powerful things.

38:41.286 --> 38:44.956
Just not these women.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.524
[Announcer] Ultimately, plans

38:46.524 --> 38:49.194
for the Sex and the Kitty, Girl
shequel were scrapped.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.462
I'm getting paid for this,
right?

38:54.132 --> 38:56.501
[applause]

38:56.501 --> 38:58.469
Nice work, kitty girls.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.839
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

39:05.843 --> 39:06.978
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.414
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

39:09.414 --> 39:11.916
starting with Trinity The Tuck.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.185
Tonight on the runway,
I mean, sometimes

39:14.185 --> 39:16.454
it's just great
to keep it simple and deliver,

39:16.454 --> 39:18.423
and that's what you did.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.358
I just couldn't
take my eyes off of you,

39:20.358 --> 39:23.261
and the body, everything works.

39:23.261 --> 39:27.298
I thought you were
one fierce kitty.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.334
I wanted to be you
and date you

39:29.334 --> 39:30.702
both at the same time.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.804
-I'm married, but--
-[Trinity] That's okay.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.105
I can be a side pussy.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.040
[all laugh]

39:36.040 --> 39:38.476
Well, let's talk about
the challenge, all right?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.945
You needed to nail this.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.581
Girl, you got this.

39:43.581 --> 39:44.649
Thank you.

39:44.649 --> 39:45.917
No, thank you.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.652
[all laugh]

39:47.652 --> 39:51.556
It stole the show, really,
for me, and it was really great.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.057
[Felicity] You calibrated
the performance.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.359
There were highs
and there were lows,

39:54.359 --> 39:56.895
and it was different,
and I really appreciated it.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.264
-And I loved watching you.
-Thank you.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.065
Up next, Monét X Change.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.433
[Michelle]
Tonight on the runway,

40:02.433 --> 40:04.702
though you look adorable,
I am getting full on mouse.

40:04.702 --> 40:05.970
Really? Mouse?

40:05.970 --> 40:07.805
Anybody else getting mouse?

40:07.805 --> 40:08.873
-It's the round ears.
-Yeah.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.875
[Jason] You're quite blended,

40:10.875 --> 40:13.077
which kind of makes everything
a little more quiet.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.213
I'm black under here,
just so you know.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.447
-What?
-[Jason] No.

40:16.447 --> 40:20.151
-[Monét] I know.
-Shocker.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.287
Okay,
so Kristin Davis's character

40:22.287 --> 40:24.689
is not always the most hilarious
character, right?

40:24.689 --> 40:26.291
Yeah.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.959
But she provides something
to bounce off of,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.694
and that's what we were
trying to get you to.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.062
Like, to be the prissy one

40:31.062 --> 40:33.331
who was so annoyed
when Monique came in there.

40:33.331 --> 40:36.334
So I wish you would have
found a way to pop more.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.669
Yeah.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.971
And I think there were
some moments that were there.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.673
Monét, you're a good actress.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.308
But I think what was missing

40:43.308 --> 40:45.810
was the real
goody-two-shoes from her.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.111
Yeah.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.313
That's why we couldn't
really go anywhere with her.

40:48.313 --> 40:49.681
-[Monét] Yeah.
-If that makes sense.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.716
-Yeah.
-[Felicity] I disagree.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.819
I think after playing
a lot of those roles myself,

40:54.819 --> 40:56.354
that's all that you can do.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.555
And if you do more than that,

40:57.555 --> 40:59.457
you're kind of shoveling shit
on top of it.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.793
So good for you.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.595
Up next, Latrice Royale.

41:04.595 --> 41:06.331
So when I heard
you were here today,

41:06.331 --> 41:09.133
I was literally dying because
I'm your biggest fan ever.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.368
Stop it.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.136
Like the biggest
fucking fan ever.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.938
So with that said,

41:13.938 --> 41:15.139
it's very hard for me to say,

41:15.139 --> 41:17.508
but I wish the costume
was a little stronger.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.510
The chiffon kind of
just fell flat for me,

41:19.510 --> 41:21.012
because it was kind of
just dragging along,

41:21.012 --> 41:22.613
and I kind of missed
the richness.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.215
-I wish you had a cape.
-Oh.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.350
That would have been
fucking major.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.552
-Roadkill.
-It might have been a roadkill.

41:27.552 --> 41:29.454
[Ross] Well, let's talk about
the challenge.

41:29.454 --> 41:32.290
I have always loved
Cynthia's character.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.559
I always thought
she was underrated,

41:34.559 --> 41:36.027
because it could seem
like she was boring,

41:36.027 --> 41:37.995
but she was a strong,
smart woman,

41:37.995 --> 41:39.864
and she knew
how to deliver a line.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.934
And you did the same thing.
Well done.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.069
You were funny,
you landed the jokes,

41:45.069 --> 41:47.238
but you really
were talking to someone.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.339
You were the one
that did that the most,

41:48.339 --> 41:50.141
and I really admire that.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.142
Thank you.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.511
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.746
This is really fun.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.848
It's campy,
but it's also beautiful.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.783
It's fashion,
and it's different.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.952
I like your take
on the modern catwoman.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.553
I loved it.
This is fashion for me.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.856
Like fashion with a capital F.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.491
Thank you, Jason.

42:06.491 --> 42:07.992
So you got SJP.

42:07.992 --> 42:10.495
Did you dole out the roles?

42:10.495 --> 42:11.696
I did.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.065
So you chose
to give yourself the big one.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.933
-Yes.
-[Michelle] Which is smart,

42:15.933 --> 42:17.802
if you can handle it.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.805
So the thing about SJP

42:20.805 --> 42:24.675
is that is the role that
every single girl wanted to be.

42:24.675 --> 42:27.645
What was missing for me
from your performance

42:27.645 --> 42:29.347
was any likeability.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.718
I didn't--I didn't like her.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.787
I didn't want to be like her.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.088
[Ross] Where you struggled

42:37.088 --> 42:41.125
was really finding the essence
of that character.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.127
You weren't bringing
yourself to a role.

42:43.127 --> 42:45.062
I think that's
what you were missing.

42:45.062 --> 42:50.468
So what we got was a whole lot
of attitude and no Naomi.

42:50.468 --> 42:53.104
Were there other roles
that you had your eye on?

42:53.104 --> 42:54.906
[Naomi] Um, not really.

42:54.906 --> 42:59.310
On season eight, I would always
like go for a role

42:59.310 --> 43:01.446
that I think I could
kind of fly under the radar,

43:01.446 --> 43:05.049
because I was too scared
to let it really stand out.

43:05.049 --> 43:06.451
So I wanted to challenge myself,

43:06.451 --> 43:08.820
like I've been challenging
myself this entire competition

43:08.820 --> 43:10.087
to go with the lead.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.023
-I love that.
-Thank you.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.225
Up next, Monique Heart.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.526
[Michelle] Tonight on the runway

43:15.526 --> 43:18.229
is probably one of the best
you've ever looked.

43:18.229 --> 43:20.498
We got the Puss in Boots
reference.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.935
Your makeup is really dynamic.
It's really fun.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.303
I'm just really proud
of you tonight.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.004
[Ross] Honestly,
I think it's my favorite

43:27.004 --> 43:29.107
I've ever seen you look.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.908
Because of course
you're glamorous

43:30.908 --> 43:32.910
and you're gorgeous
and you're put together.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.111
Yes.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.313
[Ross] But there's whimsy
in it, too.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.849
There's fun.
Let's talk about the challenge.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.150
You got a character

43:39.150 --> 43:41.919
that was one of the most
talked about ever.

43:41.919 --> 43:45.289
It could have gone really badly,
and you smashed it.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.326
Michelle, I actually did not
give her much direction.

43:48.326 --> 43:49.760
-Did you not?
-You know why?

43:49.760 --> 43:52.363
-The bitch didn't need it.
-[Michelle] There you go.

43:52.363 --> 43:55.600
I thought your character
was hilarious.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.870
I just was like laughing my ass
off the whole time, actually.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.872
And, you know,
it was pretty genius,

44:00.872 --> 44:02.106
because we really don't know
that much about that character.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.774
-Right.
-[Jason] She died.

44:03.774 --> 44:05.176
So you had to fabricate

44:05.176 --> 44:06.878
the rest of what
that character looks like.

44:06.878 --> 44:09.213
You know, I think your role
probably was longer

44:09.213 --> 44:10.781
than her actual time
at Sex and the City.

44:10.781 --> 44:12.483
[all laugh]

44:12.483 --> 44:14.752
Monique, cat got your tongue?

44:14.752 --> 44:19.891
Ah. It just feels really,
really, like, damn right.

44:19.891 --> 44:22.660
You know, this is fierce
competition across the board.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.128
So thank you.
Thank you.

44:24.128 --> 44:25.496
All right, thank you.

44:26.898 --> 44:29.734
Based on the judge's critiques,

44:29.734 --> 44:33.271
I've made some decisions.

44:33.271 --> 44:34.739
Monique Heart.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.709
Trinity The Tuck.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.645
Con-drag-ulations.

44:40.645 --> 44:42.547
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.315
[applause]

44:44.315 --> 44:46.050
Thank you.

44:46.050 --> 44:50.154
You've each won
a $3.000 gift card

44:50.154 --> 44:52.156
from The Diva's Jewels,

44:52.156 --> 44:55.560
and a three-night stay

44:55.560 --> 44:58.896
at the fabulous Standard East
Village in New York City.

44:58.896 --> 45:01.432
-Yes!
-Aah!

45:01.432 --> 45:03.534
Airfare for two included.

45:03.534 --> 45:04.702
-[Michelle] Ooh.
-Stunning.

45:04.702 --> 45:05.937
Catnip not included.

45:05.937 --> 45:07.338
[all laugh]

45:07.338 --> 45:10.741
This week
if you are not in the top,

45:10.741 --> 45:11.876
you are in the bottom.

45:16.280 --> 45:22.053
Monique, Trinity,
each of you needs to decide

45:22.053 --> 45:24.956
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

45:24.956 --> 45:26.924
if you win the lip sync.

45:28.559 --> 45:31.662
So while you queens deliberate,

45:31.662 --> 45:36.133
the judges and I will be reading
my new book, Guru.

45:36.133 --> 45:38.336
Available everywhere.

45:38.336 --> 45:40.204
Ladies, you may leave the stage.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.643
♪ I made the top four ♪

45:45.643 --> 45:49.413
♪ I made the top four ♪

45:49.413 --> 45:52.216
It feels so good
to be in the top four,

45:52.216 --> 45:54.852
but there's five of us
here tonight.

45:54.852 --> 45:58.255
And if I win this lip sync,
I have to chop somebody.

45:58.255 --> 46:00.291
[Naomi] What the fuck
just happened?

46:00.291 --> 46:02.493
[Trinity] This was probably
the hardest one to see

46:02.493 --> 46:05.763
what they were looking for
as far as the challenge.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.998
Very that.

46:06.998 --> 46:11.102
To have a sense
of feeling like you did well

46:11.102 --> 46:13.437
and still be in the bottom,
it's not good enough,

46:13.437 --> 46:14.905
that sucks.

46:14.905 --> 46:18.309
Even though I know
I did well this week,

46:18.309 --> 46:20.811
if you're not in the top,
you're in the bottom.

46:20.811 --> 46:23.814
So this is so
not where I want to be.

46:23.814 --> 46:26.117
You feeling tormented yet?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.685
[Monique] Yes.

46:27.685 --> 46:30.521
Clearly you already know
where I wanna be,

46:30.521 --> 46:34.058
and what it all means,
and we're all fucking fierce.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.292
Right.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.062
So you do what you have to do

46:38.062 --> 46:40.431
to make your spirit right

46:40.431 --> 46:42.066
and you right in your spirit,
you know what I mean?

46:43.267 --> 46:45.102
Okay, girl, like,

46:45.102 --> 46:46.804
it's like I've been doing
a fierce job in the competition,

46:46.804 --> 46:49.240
and, you know, I just wasn't
the fiercest today,

46:49.240 --> 46:50.541
and I'm in the bottom.

46:50.541 --> 46:54.578
I can't deny that you have
the second most wins.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.013
Yeah.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.182
And you've--this is the only
your second time in the bottom.

46:58.182 --> 46:59.216
Yeah.

46:59.216 --> 47:00.484
Who would you send home?

47:00.484 --> 47:02.186
If I was in the top?

47:02.186 --> 47:04.822
I would probably choose Latrice.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.057
Just because
she's been here before,

47:06.057 --> 47:07.491
she's went, she's came back.

47:07.491 --> 47:08.659
And it's like, bitch,
when you come back,

47:08.659 --> 47:10.795
you need to try your best
to be at the top

47:10.795 --> 47:12.797
so that you're not in that
situation to go home again.

47:14.398 --> 47:16.033
Okay. Very good point.

47:17.401 --> 47:21.505
But if you're not here tomorrow,

47:21.505 --> 47:23.107
don't take it personal.

47:23.107 --> 47:25.543
[Monét]
Trinity has made it clear

47:25.543 --> 47:27.845
that she wants to play
a fair game.

47:27.845 --> 47:31.382
But she might have waited this
entire season to play strategy

47:31.382 --> 47:33.150
and send home
a strong competitor.

47:33.150 --> 47:36.554
The feeling of being
possibly chopped

47:36.554 --> 47:41.092
so close to the final four
is gruesome.

47:41.092 --> 47:42.393
Okay, so listen.

47:42.393 --> 47:43.594
What's up, pussycat?

47:43.594 --> 47:44.829
[Trinity]
I'm not going to lie to you.

47:44.829 --> 47:46.230
I don't know
who I'm gonna pick yet.

47:46.230 --> 47:48.466
Trinity has so many opinions

47:48.466 --> 47:50.568
about the report card
and the fairness,

47:50.568 --> 47:54.405
so the fact that Latrice and I
are neck and neck with wins,

47:54.405 --> 47:56.974
she could send me home.

47:56.974 --> 47:59.543
What I want to know is
who would you send home?

47:59.543 --> 48:01.379
[whistles]

48:01.379 --> 48:04.115
It would be a gag,
because I saved her last week.

48:04.115 --> 48:07.151
But I'm not really thrilled
with Latrice's performance

48:07.151 --> 48:08.152
while she's been here.

48:08.152 --> 48:09.520
Okay.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.355
She had some peaks,
but not a lot.

48:12.757 --> 48:16.227
I'm taking into consideration
not just the performances here.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.562
I'm taking into consideration
full body of work,

48:18.562 --> 48:22.333
outside of here,
and who you are as a person.

48:22.333 --> 48:26.403
Naomi's got some fierce-ass
runways, bitch.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.305
She is an amazing lip syncer,

48:28.305 --> 48:32.743
and she's proven that
since her last season here,

48:32.743 --> 48:34.245
she has grown a lot.

48:34.245 --> 48:38.883
But her track record has shown
she has more growing to do.

48:38.883 --> 48:42.887
To me all of that factors in to
who should win this competition.

48:44.288 --> 48:46.991
Before we do the thing,
I want to say this.

48:46.991 --> 48:48.292
I don't wanna go home.

48:48.292 --> 48:51.262
I've been doing
a great job on All Stars.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.396
I've really redeemed myself

48:52.396 --> 48:54.598
from a lot of my mistakes
of season 10.

48:54.598 --> 48:57.768
And I don't think that
my work at All Stars is done.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.904
I feel like I still have

48:59.904 --> 49:01.605
the one more fucking challenge
to do, bitch.

49:01.605 --> 49:02.640
Top four.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.509
[Monét] Monique is my sister,

49:05.509 --> 49:08.179
so I'm hoping that
she'll have my back.

49:08.179 --> 49:11.248
As close as we got during
the competition, here we are.

49:11.248 --> 49:14.418
Yeah. Look, regardless of what
your decision is, Monique--

49:14.418 --> 49:16.253
I just want to know
that you won't hate me.

49:16.253 --> 49:22.860
Is Monique cut-a-bitch Heart
about to send me home?

49:22.860 --> 49:26.464
Is she about to gag
the fuck out of me?

49:26.464 --> 49:29.133
May the odds
ever be in your favor.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.669
[kiss]

49:37.174 --> 49:38.375
I know this look is pussy.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.944
[both laugh]

49:39.944 --> 49:42.146
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.714
[Naomi] I thought
you did a really good job,

49:43.714 --> 49:45.316
and I think I've done
a really good job.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.817
All of us
did a really good job.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.320
I really want to honor everyone.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.388
And it sucks because you're
just like how do I do this?

49:52.790 --> 49:54.959
Who do you think
should go home?

49:54.959 --> 49:57.495
Uh, I--I--I don't know.

49:57.495 --> 50:00.631
Your life is on the line,
because, guess what?

50:01.732 --> 50:04.401
Both of them said you.

50:04.401 --> 50:07.037
Okay. All right.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.472
Interesting.

50:08.472 --> 50:11.609
These bitches
are gunning for me.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.811
It'd probably be Naomi
at this point.

50:13.811 --> 50:15.145
Why do you think Naomi?

50:15.145 --> 50:17.348
Naomi did the worst
in this challenge.

50:17.348 --> 50:19.316
She took on a bit more
than she could chew on.

50:19.316 --> 50:21.819
So she made her bed, lie in it.

50:21.819 --> 50:23.921
At home.

50:23.921 --> 50:25.923
That's a very good point.

50:27.391 --> 50:28.893
They're talking a long time.

50:28.893 --> 50:30.261
-They're talking a long time.
-They are.

50:30.261 --> 50:31.762
Shade. I call shade.

50:31.762 --> 50:33.831
[Naomi] Honestly,
she could tell Latrice,

50:33.831 --> 50:35.499
like, what I said about her,
and I'd be like, yeah,

50:35.499 --> 50:36.567
that's exactly what I said.

50:36.567 --> 50:37.601
I don't give a fuck.

50:37.601 --> 50:39.303
Honestly,
I don't give a fuck.

50:42.406 --> 50:45.242
I found out y'all
both voted me off the island.

50:45.242 --> 50:46.777
[Monét] Latrice,
you know I love you.

50:46.777 --> 50:47.878
It's just
you had to pick a name.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.713
-Yeah.
-I said you

50:49.713 --> 50:52.483
because based on consistency
in this competition,

50:52.483 --> 50:53.817
you've been
the most inconsistent.

50:55.419 --> 50:56.921
Have I?

50:56.921 --> 50:58.422
[Naomi] Yeah.
You don't think

50:58.422 --> 50:59.657
that you deserve to be
in the bottom at all?

50:59.657 --> 51:01.358
[Latrice] Well,
based on my critique, no.

51:02.626 --> 51:03.928
Who did you pick to send home?

51:03.928 --> 51:05.296
Naomi.

51:07.932 --> 51:11.068
Naomi, debt has been paid,
bitch.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.637
If it's me or you, you gotta go.

51:15.105 --> 51:17.574
[Trinity] There's reason
for all three of them to stay,

51:17.574 --> 51:20.377
and there's reason
for all three of them to go.

51:20.377 --> 51:22.680
For me,
like me and Monét both

51:22.680 --> 51:24.648
have been in that place
of a quick turnaround

51:24.648 --> 51:26.817
and really have shown
the fuck out.

51:26.817 --> 51:30.788
So for sure, she's not one on
my list for an immediate chop.

51:30.788 --> 51:33.591
[Trinity] Monét has had
a lot of high points

51:33.591 --> 51:35.359
through this competition.

51:35.359 --> 51:38.295
And I've seen
a lot of growth with Monét.

51:38.295 --> 51:41.932
But is that enough
for her to be top four?

51:41.932 --> 51:44.401
I just don't know.

51:44.401 --> 51:46.103
I'll take into consideration

51:46.103 --> 51:49.340
who I think would be a good
representative of this title.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.674
Yeah.

51:50.674 --> 51:54.244
And Latrice is somebody
that thousands look up to.

51:54.244 --> 51:55.746
That is really true.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.214
[Trinity] And so I can't
not think about that.

51:57.214 --> 52:03.287
Yeah. I do not feel okay
chopping Latrice,

52:03.287 --> 52:05.089
because I know
what her message is,

52:05.089 --> 52:07.591
I know what her heart is, and
I know what her integrity is.

52:07.591 --> 52:09.493
But at the same time...

52:09.493 --> 52:11.695
...she's been in the bottom
the most.

52:12.930 --> 52:15.432
Naomi has been turning it.

52:15.432 --> 52:16.600
I kind of disagree.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.203
I kind of feel like
Naomi is forgettable.

52:19.203 --> 52:21.405
She's sickening
on the runway, but--

52:21.405 --> 52:24.308
Naomi had
really bad critiques today,

52:24.308 --> 52:26.343
and that is definitely
something to think about.

52:26.343 --> 52:29.013
So, I mean,
that really, really is.

52:29.013 --> 52:31.749
I do know that I don't know.

52:31.749 --> 52:33.150
Amen.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.352
Mm, mm, mm.

52:35.352 --> 52:38.222
I'm a good author.

52:38.222 --> 52:41.759
There's so many beautiful
photographs in here.

52:41.759 --> 52:45.562
I wish I knew how to read.

52:45.562 --> 52:47.998
Ooh, she's got
such pretty hair.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.267
I just can't stop touching it.

52:50.267 --> 52:53.437
Hey, I got a book, too,
you know.

52:53.437 --> 52:55.439
Ooh, look at all that ass.

52:55.439 --> 52:56.740
[Doll] Silence!

52:56.740 --> 52:58.409
Bring back my All Stars.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.717
[Trinity] I am here
for business.

53:06.717 --> 53:10.154
This decides
who's in the top four.

53:10.154 --> 53:13.390
And looking at
the bottom three,

53:13.390 --> 53:15.959
I'm taking into consideration
everything

53:15.959 --> 53:18.028
from who you are
as an entertainer,

53:18.028 --> 53:19.263
who you are as a person,

53:19.263 --> 53:20.597
your track record
in the competition,

53:20.597 --> 53:25.202
and also, do I think
you are ready to reign.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.938
[Monique]
We have all made it so far

53:27.938 --> 53:30.174
and fought so hard to get here.

53:30.174 --> 53:32.443
We are close
to the finish line.

53:32.443 --> 53:34.011
This is it.

53:34.011 --> 53:36.647
The dream goes on
for four of us.

53:36.647 --> 53:41.118
But with great power
comes great responsibility.

53:41.118 --> 53:44.621
So tonight, I might have
to crush someone's dream.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.861
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

53:50.861 --> 53:54.631
Two All Stars stand before me.

53:54.631 --> 53:57.634
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

53:57.634 --> 54:02.206
win $10.000,
and earn the power

54:02.206 --> 54:06.076
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

54:08.145 --> 54:11.215
The time has come
for you to lip sync...

54:11.215 --> 54:14.084
[echoing] for your legacy.

54:16.820 --> 54:22.659
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Ladies, I've made my decision.

Trinity...

56:12.603 --> 56:14.004
You're a winner, baby.

56:14.004 --> 56:16.707
[applause]

You've earned a cash tip
of $10.000.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.448
Thank you.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.183
I'm extremely proud of myself

56:26.183 --> 56:28.151
that I have four wins

56:28.151 --> 56:29.586
and I've won two lip syncs.

56:29.586 --> 56:30.821
and made it
all the way to the end

56:30.821 --> 56:33.557
in a fierce competition.

56:33.557 --> 56:37.461
But it all of a sudden hits me

56:37.461 --> 56:42.266
that now I have to reveal
who I'm choosing to go home,

56:42.266 --> 56:47.037
and...I've got to crush
somebody's dream.

56:47.037 --> 56:50.207
[RuPaul] Monique, you are safe.

56:50.207 --> 56:52.509
You may step
to the back of the stage.

56:52.509 --> 56:54.177
[applause]

56:54.177 --> 56:56.446
Will the bottom three
please step forward?

57:04.288 --> 57:09.026
Trinity, with great power
comes great responsibility.

57:09.026 --> 57:14.197
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:14.197 --> 57:17.134
After talking
to all the girls,

57:17.134 --> 57:20.203
there were several
great points made

57:20.203 --> 57:23.006
by all three of them
why they should stay

57:23.006 --> 57:24.408
and who should go.

57:24.408 --> 57:29.046
And the queen that I've
decided to send home tonight

57:29.046 --> 57:34.451
is fierce
and she will forever be

57:34.451 --> 57:35.819
someone everyone looks up to.

57:37.554 --> 57:39.289
So I'm sending home Latrice.

57:46.897 --> 57:49.366
Latrice Royale,

57:49.366 --> 57:53.070
as it is written,
so it shall be done.

57:53.070 --> 57:57.674
You are and will always be
an All Star.

57:57.674 --> 57:59.576
Thank you so much.

57:59.576 --> 58:02.946
Now sashay away.

58:02.946 --> 58:04.081
Sorry.

58:04.081 --> 58:05.148
It's okay, girl.

58:05.148 --> 58:06.583
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

58:06.583 --> 58:09.786
[Trinity] All right, babe.

58:09.786 --> 58:13.190
I already said my byes once,
so bye.

58:13.190 --> 58:15.692
[all laugh]

58:18.762 --> 58:21.331
All the girls kind of felt like
it was my time to go

58:21.331 --> 58:24.134
I guess because
I got sent home once before.

58:24.134 --> 58:25.936
Which is fine.
I'm cool.

58:25.936 --> 58:28.805
This is the game we came
to play, and they played it.

58:28.805 --> 58:30.640
Trinity I'm sure
has her reasons.

58:30.640 --> 58:32.642
There's no hard feelings.

58:32.642 --> 58:34.177
Bitch, I'll see her on the road.

58:34.177 --> 58:37.013
It'll be a kiki and we'll
laugh about this later.

58:37.013 --> 58:40.751
But right now it's toodle-oo,
so farewell, so long.

58:40.751 --> 58:42.185
I have a lot
to be thankful for.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.755
I had a very enjoyable time
this go-around.

58:44.755 --> 58:49.059
That was my number one goal,
and check mark.

58:49.059 --> 58:50.761
I did.
I had a great time.

58:50.761 --> 58:53.363
So I'm gonna go and be wonderful

58:53.363 --> 58:55.232
and marry the man of my dreams.

58:55.232 --> 58:58.101
To all of my royal court, baby,
mama's coming home

58:58.101 --> 59:01.371
and I'm proud, and I'm still
the queen of queens, darling.

My top four All Stars.

59:07.744 --> 59:11.848
Next week is the All Star
grand finale,

59:11.848 --> 59:13.917
and I want to hear
from our fans.

59:13.917 --> 59:16.787
Which queen deserves
a coveted spot

59:16.787 --> 59:19.356
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame?

59:19.356 --> 59:23.293
Are you Team Monét,
Team Monique,

59:23.293 --> 59:26.296
Team Naomi,
or Team Trinity?

59:26.296 --> 59:29.966
Let your voice be heard
at RuPaul's Drag Race,

59:29.966 --> 59:31.902
#AllStar4.

59:31.902 --> 59:36.306
And don't miss next week
when we crown a winner, baby.

59:36.306 --> 59:38.475
