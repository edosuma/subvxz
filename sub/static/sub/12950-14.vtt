00:03.503 --> 00:05.738
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:07.639
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.640 --> 00:10.609
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.710 --> 00:12.578
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:14.413
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.414 --> 00:16.815
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:19.376
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.452 --> 00:20.886
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.887 --> 00:22.988
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.989 --> 00:24.890
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.891 --> 00:26.792
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.793 --> 00:28.160
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:30.062
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.797
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.798 --> 00:35.256
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:39.038
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:41.735
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.841 --> 00:44.341
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.911
<i>My father.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:50.548
Francie...

00:50.583 --> 00:51.683
Will you marry me?

00:51.684 --> 00:53.252
Yes.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.753
Yes, Charlie, I will.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.256
On my voice mail,

00:57.257 --> 00:59.324
you said you were working
on a story about my dad.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.627
David McNeil.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.825
I know my dad won't talk,
because he's afraid

01:04.897 --> 01:07.232
that something bad will
happen to me if he does.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.333
Yeah.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.935
I'm gonna go away.
Now, tomorrow.

01:09.936 --> 01:13.565
Whenever I know that someone
is fighting for my father.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.173
So, please...

01:16.676 --> 01:19.176
...just help my father.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.915
For the past year,
I've been on covert duty

01:22.916 --> 01:25.510
trying to penetrate
Cole's intelligence network.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.153
McKenas Cole.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.890
Former SD-6.

01:31.891 --> 01:35.190
Now he works for someone
he calls "The Man. "

01:35.261 --> 01:36.829
What is that? Perfume?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.630
Whatever this is,
we have it now,

01:38.631 --> 01:40.999
and they don't, because of you.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Not just me.

01:42.001 --> 01:44.501
Because of you.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.516 --> 02:31.817
You're looking
at surveillance footage taken

02:31.818 --> 02:34.186
from outside
Tyno-Chem engineering.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.188
Which, as you know,
is the front company

02:36.189 --> 02:37.589
for FTL Headquarters.

02:37.590 --> 02:41.651
You may recognize the man
on the ground as Quan Li.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.895
Wait, wait.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.496
Quan Li was assassinated?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.431
- The head of FTL?
- Yes.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.200
His entire security detail
was ambushed

02:48.201 --> 02:51.932
inside the building,
leaving Li utterly defenseless.

02:52.038 --> 02:53.205
Have you I.D.'d
the shooter?

02:53.206 --> 02:55.706
His face didn't appear
in any of our databases.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.376
He doesn't seem to mind
being photographed.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.877
Now, this young man
led a commando unit

02:59.979 --> 03:01.513
into FTL Headquarters last week

03:01.514 --> 03:04.381
at precisely the same time
that we were attacked here.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.084
The objective was the same.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.253
They were there
to steal a Rambaldi artifact.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.155
Their agent roster
was compromised.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.989
Their entire network crumbled
within hours of the attack.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.994
What you're saying is
FTL no longer exists.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.930
Um, sorry, uh...

03:17.931 --> 03:21.594
stupid question,
but, uh, since FTL is...

03:21.668 --> 03:24.168
sorry, was... an enemy forever,

03:24.270 --> 03:26.738
shouldn't we
be drinking champagne?

03:26.739 --> 03:28.607
Someone had the means
to launch a unilateral attack

03:28.608 --> 03:29.841
on us and FTL,

03:29.842 --> 03:32.436
and we haven't got a clue
who's responsible.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.580
In addition, they now have
what seems to be

03:34.581 --> 03:36.181
the most significant
collection

03:36.182 --> 03:37.950
of Rambaldi artifacts
in the world.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.985
They may have enough
to uncover

03:39.986 --> 03:43.012
what Rambaldi was ultimately
working on before we do.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.458
Oh.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.160
Yeah, that does suck.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.828
This new enemy
isn't stopping there.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.296
Our assets in Vladivostok

03:51.297 --> 03:53.031
intercepted a communiqué
last night.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.566
The group
claiming responsibility

03:54.567 --> 03:57.365
for the two attacks
has contacted K-Directorate.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.937
They've proposed a meeting
later this week

03:58.938 --> 04:01.306
to discuss the sharing
of Rambaldi technology.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.308
This man's name
is Brandon Dahlgren.

04:03.309 --> 04:04.776
He lives year-round

04:04.777 --> 04:06.478
in a penthouse
of the Regal Casino.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.814
He's a go-between
for K-Directorate.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.849
Dahlgren is expecting
to receive a phone call

04:10.850 --> 04:13.185
detailing the time and location
of this meeting.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.120
This is information
that we need.

04:15.121 --> 04:16.887
Dixon, you're on point
for this one.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.024
Sydney, you're on comms.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.159
You're going in
as Darian Buchanan.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.594
He's a delegate from
the Jamaican Parliament

04:22.595 --> 04:24.396
who plans to visit
Las Vegas next week.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.331
As soon as we know that
he's en route,

04:26.332 --> 04:28.500
you'll go in
posing as Buchanan.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.102
You'll be flagged as a V.I.P.
So you can gamble

04:30.103 --> 04:31.970
in the casino's
private gaming suite,

04:31.971 --> 04:33.939
where Dahlgren
regularly plays.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.407
That's where
you'll plant the bug.

04:35.408 --> 04:38.571
Marshall's making one that
matches a ring Dahlgren wears.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.312
Be prepared to leave
as soon as we get word

04:40.313 --> 04:41.780
that Buchanan's plane
is in the air.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.548
That's it.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.951
Sydney, stay a minute.

04:51.724 --> 04:53.558
Is everything okay?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.653
I was about to ask you
the same question.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.632
Listen...

05:00.633 --> 05:01.967
I don't mean to pry,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.766
but I had a conversation
with your father...

05:04.871 --> 05:06.038
about your mother.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.974
He told you
that she was KGB.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.943
I'm sorry.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.713
It's okay.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.517
I want to tell you again

05:18.518 --> 05:21.043
how much I appreciate
your service to SD-6

05:21.120 --> 05:23.620
during the incident
last week.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.790
Every person here
owes you their life.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.366
How's the finger?

05:38.471 --> 05:39.838
Well...

05:39.839 --> 05:41.873
I'm told
it's gonna heal nicely.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.076
Thank you.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.577
Shall we?

05:55.421 --> 05:57.022
I felt sick.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.651
All those people
standing there.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.752
Patriots. Believing they work
for the U.S. Government.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.130
None of them realizing
the information they gather

06:05.131 --> 06:06.365
is only being used

06:06.366 --> 06:08.866
by heartless men
like Arvin Sloane

06:08.935 --> 06:11.203
for an organization that
would trade their lives

06:11.204 --> 06:13.704
for a profit in a heartbeat.

06:14.941 --> 06:18.274
I just wanted to rip
his finger right off again.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.145
Does that make me
a bad person?

06:20.146 --> 06:21.680
No.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.382
That might have
blown your cover.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.616
You think?

06:24.617 --> 06:27.117
Yeah.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.815
Look, you'll tag Dahlgren
in Vegas.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.688
When SD-6 gets more specifics
about the meeting,

06:33.760 --> 06:35.427
we'll figure out
what our next move is.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.129
Hey, did the guy
from your office

06:37.130 --> 06:38.163
end up reporting you?

06:38.164 --> 06:40.298
Haladki? Yeah, he did.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.234
But Devlin only slapped me
on the wrist,

06:42.235 --> 06:43.869
even though going into SD-6
without clearance

06:43.870 --> 06:45.404
wasn't exactly constitutional.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.033
I was hoping Haladki
would get nailed for snitching,

06:48.141 --> 06:50.142
but I guess we broke even
on this one.

06:50.143 --> 06:50.776
Are you okay?

06:50.777 --> 06:53.405
It's nothing.
I'm just a little bruised.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.980
You can't really tell.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.781
That's 'cause I'm wearing
a pound of cover-up.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.986
We just heard from our
surveillance team in Jamaica.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.728
Buchanan's pilot's been
called to the airstrip.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.163
It could indicate he'll
be off the ground

07:11.164 --> 07:12.297
by the end of the day.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.699
You should be ready to leave
late this afternoon.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.261
That's fine. I just
have to swing by school.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.238
How, uh...
how's that going?

07:22.341 --> 07:24.841
School?

07:24.944 --> 07:27.345
Good.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.846
Okay.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.850
Actually...

07:31.851 --> 07:35.582
since you're asking...

07:35.655 --> 07:36.788
I've gone from thinking

07:36.789 --> 07:38.723
that my mother
was a literature professor

07:38.724 --> 07:41.059
to finding out
that she was KGB.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.961
I'm sure
when you found that out,

07:42.962 --> 07:45.462
you must have felt
as lost as I do.

07:54.907 --> 07:58.240
Last week, I was ready
to leave SD-6.

07:59.445 --> 08:02.380
But maybe I was focusing
on the wrong place.

08:02.448 --> 08:06.407
I think maybe I only went
to grad school because Mom did.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.986
She was a teacher,

08:07.987 --> 08:11.252
so I always thought that was
something I wanted to do.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.659
But now that I know
it was just her cover,

08:14.660 --> 08:18.892
and that it didn't
mean anything to her...

08:18.965 --> 08:21.798
I'm thinking
I should just drop it.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.408
Dad?

08:30.409 --> 08:32.811
Yes, um...

08:32.812 --> 08:35.871
I understand.
I just, um...

08:40.986 --> 08:43.486
I'm not sure
I'm the best person to ask.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.957
Oh.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.458
Okay.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.029
I should go.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.543
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.378
I actually have
two tape recorders.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.846
You are the best.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.347
Mine just died.
Oh, great.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.384
What is that?

09:46.385 --> 09:48.620
- What?
- Is that a hickey?

09:48.621 --> 09:50.689
No, is it? What?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.757
Oh, my God.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.992
I have to go to a meeting.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.760
Wait. I actually have cover-up.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.596
- Do you have enough?
- Yeah, I've got enough.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.331
- It's very embarrassing.
- The fact that I saw it,

09:59.332 --> 10:00.665
or just that it's there?

10:00.666 --> 10:02.233
No, look at it.
I feel like I'm 15 years old.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.401
That's about the age
of your intern.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.003
When I said 15,
I knew you were...

10:05.004 --> 10:06.571
Did the Clinton Administration
teach you nothing?

10:06.572 --> 10:07.706
Well, I'm not married.
I can date...

10:07.707 --> 10:09.574
Don't start defending
your thing with Jenny.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.609
She's not in your league.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.377
Well, who's in my league?
Just what league?

10:12.378 --> 10:14.045
Show me a league,
and I'll buy the ticket.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.546
I'll go to the meetings.
I'll try to find those people.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.850
Where are they?

10:18.851 --> 10:20.952
Is it good?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.453
Yeah.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.424
What?

10:26.425 --> 10:28.126
Nothing.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.029
The next time that Charlie and I

10:31.030 --> 10:32.364
go to breakfast
with our parents,

10:32.365 --> 10:34.532
remind me that mimosas
are verboten.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.668
Oh, God.
Today was the big brunch.

10:36.669 --> 10:37.769
They didn't get along?

10:37.770 --> 10:41.103
They got along so well,
they're going on vacation.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.441
What's wrong with that?
That's nice.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.411
Nice? That is the makings
of a disaster.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.108
They're going away without us
and plan the whole wedding.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.983
Where are you off to this time?

10:51.984 --> 10:53.284
Vegas.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.981
Vegas. What was I just saying?
Where should we go?

10:56.055 --> 10:59.354
After that brunch,
Vegas isn't far enough.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.359
I'm serious.
Baby, that's our cue.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.994
We could just go tonight.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.589
Wait. This is not
a vacation for me.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.465
There's this
public-relations conference...

11:07.466 --> 11:09.701
Sydney, we don't need you
to babysit.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.169
What I mean is...

11:11.170 --> 11:13.571
I'd want to hang out
with you guys.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.774
Just wait a week.
We'll all go together.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.539
All right, I guess.
Ugh, that breakfast blew.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.171
You'll tell me about it later.
I got to go to school.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.947
I got to go, too.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.182
Oh, hey.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.778
I got a gig on Thursday,
and I was wondering

11:27.853 --> 11:28.787
if you wouldn't mind

11:28.788 --> 11:30.588
putting up some fliers
on campus for me?

11:30.589 --> 11:32.557
Yeah. Do I get 10%?

11:32.558 --> 11:34.292
Sure. I'll give you
that dollar now.

11:34.293 --> 11:35.760
You want to help
put some up, too?

11:35.761 --> 11:37.896
My meeting's at a prison.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.397
You never know.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.899
Take care, man.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.300
All right, Will.

11:42.301 --> 11:45.532
I'm surprised you wanted
to meet with me so soon.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.539
I spent
eight years in this place

11:47.540 --> 11:49.641
living in fear of what
these people might do

11:49.642 --> 11:52.142
to my daughter, to Kelly.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.511
You come in here

11:53.512 --> 11:55.580
and start asking me
questions about SD-6.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.982
I just wasn't prepared.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.017
I understand.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.452
But...

12:00.453 --> 12:01.886
Kelly came to me.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.788
She told me she met you,

12:03.789 --> 12:05.290
about her conversation
with Robert,

12:05.291 --> 12:08.021
about her going away, and...

12:08.094 --> 12:10.428
I can't spend another
eight years like this.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.396
I need to talk.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.797
Is Kelly safe?

12:12.798 --> 12:14.265
I'm not gonna
do the story otherwise.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.067
I'm her father.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.602
Neither would I.

12:17.603 --> 12:21.061
Yeah, she's been sent away.
She's out of the country.

12:21.173 --> 12:25.303
Cost me nearly everything
I have left, but, uh...

12:25.377 --> 12:26.377
but she's safe.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.379
Okay, so, who are they?

12:28.380 --> 12:31.372
What do they do?
What the hell's SD-6?

12:33.652 --> 12:36.314
All right, I'm gonna
tell you what I know.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.888
But first, there's
something you have to do.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.296
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.431
Hi, I'm Will Tippin.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.199
I'm here to interview
Mr. Glasner.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.868
McNEIL:
You have to contact a company

12:49.869 --> 12:51.936
called O.T. Technologies

12:51.937 --> 12:54.405
and tell them you want
to interview their CEO.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.174
His name is Larry Glasner.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.876
Why would I want
to interview Mr. Glasner?

12:57.877 --> 13:01.244
You don't, but you got to
get into the building.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.947
I used to work there,

13:02.948 --> 13:07.112
and before my trial,
I did something illegal,

13:07.186 --> 13:09.020
but really smart.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.288
I knew there were people

13:10.289 --> 13:12.917
that wanted to use
my encryption software

13:12.992 --> 13:15.326
and that someone was
gonna use it for no good.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.091
So I wrote a subroutine
in the program

13:18.164 --> 13:20.465
that would send a tag
to a dedicated server.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.734
I don't really know
the technical jargon.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.669
It's like a digital guest book.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.935
Anybody that uses the program
would unknowingly sign in.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.208
I wanted to make sure
there was a trail in case

13:30.209 --> 13:32.243
I wanted to pursue the people
that were setting me up.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.579
There's a list of people
that used your program?

13:34.580 --> 13:36.347
Right.
It should be on a server

13:36.348 --> 13:38.383
in the computer room
at O.T. Tech.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.185
Once you get
into the building,

13:40.186 --> 13:42.686
you're gonna tell them that
you want to use the restroom.

13:42.688 --> 13:45.089
Excuse me, can you tell me
where the restroom is, please?

13:45.090 --> 13:47.820
McNEIL: Three doors past
the bathroom on the first floor

13:47.893 --> 13:49.994
is the door
to the computer room.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.453
The passcode is 4747.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.404
Once you're in, you're gonna
log on to the system.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.316
I'll give you
all the access codes.

14:11.317 --> 14:14.252
You're gonna search
for a file called Dolphin.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.721
Download it.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.690
That's the one.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.159
That's our road map.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.152
That's gonna lead us to SD-6.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.000
Your paper had
the unlucky distinction

14:29.001 --> 14:31.501
of being
the last one I graded.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.003
I didn't come for the paper.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.676
I've decided
to leave the program,

14:38.677 --> 14:41.646
and I need your signature
to drop the course.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.351
Why?

14:46.352 --> 14:48.852
I've been just
wearing myself too thin...

14:48.854 --> 14:51.354
trying to finish the program
and do my job.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.857
You were so right when you said

14:52.858 --> 14:55.452
that work was
getting in the way here.

14:55.527 --> 14:58.587
But the fact is...

14:58.664 --> 15:01.633
I'm not sure I want
to be a teacher anymore.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.566
Sydney...

15:05.671 --> 15:08.765
you're one of the best
students I've ever had.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.379
That's it.
That's my pep talk.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.315
But I urge you...
think about it a little more

15:17.383 --> 15:19.943
before you make
your final decision.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.904
Oh, my God.

15:39.905 --> 15:40.705
What?

15:40.706 --> 15:42.573
I didn't know
Charlie was a singer.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.608
You know Charlie?

15:43.609 --> 15:46.109
Yeah, unfortunately.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.605
You were in "British Authors
Before 1800."

15:50.683 --> 15:51.816
Oh, yeah.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.718
That was a good class.
Stella Campbell.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.219
Sydney Bristow.
Why do you say "unfortunately"?

15:56.221 --> 15:59.816
Oh, I don't know.
It was nothing.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.459
We went out
for a few months,

16:01.460 --> 16:04.759
and he was just a jerk
when he ended it.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.764
He's just a guy.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.166
How long ago?

16:08.167 --> 16:10.931
Just a few months ago.
Whatever.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.670
- A few months?
- Yeah. Why?

16:12.671 --> 16:16.573
Because he's engaged
to a friend of mine.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.810
Charlie Bernard.
Are you sure it's him?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.044
How long has he been engaged?

16:20.045 --> 16:22.480
- How long did you two go out?
- Just a few months.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.450
- A few months?
- What a pig.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.051
God, it figures.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.387
Who's your friend?
Rachel? That blond girl?

16:29.388 --> 16:31.055
'Cause I thought something
was going on with her.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.556
No, my friend is someone else.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.326
Oh, listen.
You know what?

16:35.327 --> 16:38.785
I just really need to learn
how to keep my mouth shut.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.131
I'll see you around.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.632
Okay.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.273
Will, I don't know what to do.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.580
Are you sure
it's the same Charlie?

16:55.581 --> 16:57.882
Yes, and Francie
is gonna be devastated.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.951
This just doesn't make
any sense.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.152
I don't understand.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.187
Who the hell lives
a double life like that?

17:03.188 --> 17:05.589
Seriously.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.224
There are people.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.193
Yeah, I guess.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.261
How am I gonna tell her?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.096
Um...

17:12.097 --> 17:13.498
Okay, okay.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.165
Let me make a suggestion.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.268
Yeah, make sure
she's sitting down,

17:17.269 --> 17:19.829
and make sure
that she is very drunk.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.930
Yeah, you got to get her
sauced, because...

17:23.041 --> 17:25.143
This is really gonna hurt.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.578
It is gonna hurt.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.080
I'll call you later.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.581
Okay.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.120
Can you focus?

17:36.121 --> 17:38.589
We're trained to see details...

17:38.590 --> 17:40.792
to read people in situations...

17:40.793 --> 17:43.227
to look at clues, red flags.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.229
I started to think I was
getting pretty good at it.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.063
It turns out my best friend's
fiancé is a cheat.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.934
Out of the blue?

17:53.072 --> 17:57.532
I guess, in retrospect,
there were signs.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.874
But he could be so sweet
to her, you know?

18:00.946 --> 18:02.080
I don't have to lecture you

18:02.081 --> 18:04.879
about people's capacity
to keep secrets.

18:07.486 --> 18:11.445
I'll be in touch as soon as
I'm into the casino's database.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.558
Marshall says this
is an exact replica

18:13.559 --> 18:14.892
of Dahlgren's ring.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.061
Exact will be nice.
Thanks.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.362
And good luck.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.863
You too.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.437
Miss, this entrance
is for employees only.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.101
Oh, sorry.
I just started on Friday.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.011
My mistake.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.192
I'm in.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.012
- Oh, my God.
- Syd, what's wrong?

19:13.185 --> 19:16.382
You're not gonna believe it.
Francie and Charlie are here.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.256
- Did they see you?
- No.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.757
Just make sure they don't.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.072
How far off are you?

19:35.073 --> 19:36.774
Give me two minutes.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.493
Say you want
to hack into a casino.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.597
Do you remember
how tight security was

19:59.598 --> 20:01.499
in that Siberian silo
a couple years ago?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.234
Cakewalk compared to Vegas.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.670
Casino security
is like an onion.

20:05.671 --> 20:08.072
It's layer after layer
after layer.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.341
The more you peel back,
the more you want to cry.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.610
Face recognition,
video surveillance.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.045
The only way
to get inside the system

20:14.046 --> 20:16.810
is to splice directly into
one of the fiber optic cables,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.510
but any interruption in
the feed will alert security.

20:19.585 --> 20:23.112
Except the one thing
nobody else has but you is me,

20:23.188 --> 20:25.816
and I...

20:25.891 --> 20:27.191
have this.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.820
This is a razor prism.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.092
It will cut directly
into any fiber optic cable,

20:33.165 --> 20:34.265
plus it will allow you

20:34.266 --> 20:37.394
total access without
interrupting the data stream.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.583
Okay, Dixon, go.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.839
Sir, Mr. Buchanan has arrived.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.008
Mr. Buchanan, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.142
Likewise.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.478
We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

21:20.479 --> 21:21.545
Yes, I know.

21:21.546 --> 21:23.547
I came ahead of the delegation

21:23.548 --> 21:26.949
to win back the money
I lost last year.

21:27.019 --> 21:31.080
Do I suspect the U.S. Senate
hosts these conferences here

21:31.156 --> 21:33.224
so that we will lose
our shirts?

21:33.225 --> 21:35.192
Perhaps you'll be
more comfortable

21:35.193 --> 21:36.560
in our private gaming suite.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.325
Oh, okay.
Yes, thank you.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.667
Syd, hey. We're in Vegas.
We're here.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.201
What room are you in?

21:44.202 --> 21:46.966
Give me a call on my cellphone
when you get this message.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.572
Where the hell are you?
I'll talk to you soon.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.377
Number 9.
We have a winner.

21:53.378 --> 21:56.245
We just got here,
and we're up 100 bucks.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.315
All right, all right.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.816
Was coming to Vegas
the greatest idea or what?

22:01.887 --> 22:03.387
Hey, check it out.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.522
What?

22:04.523 --> 22:06.691
There's a wedding chapel.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.626
Aw, come on.

22:08.627 --> 22:09.927
Why not?

22:09.928 --> 22:11.095
Just think about it.

22:11.096 --> 22:15.499
Just us, no parents,
no hassle.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.836
I understand you have
a line of credit with us.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.204
Would you like
to draw down on it?

22:20.205 --> 22:23.106
Yes, man. I usually start off
with half a million.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.675
I feel lucky today.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.283
Okay.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.784
Dahlgren is
at the back poker table.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.588
May I join you?

22:37.589 --> 22:40.089
Yeah, sure.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.198
Good luck, sir.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.032
Thank you.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.167
The game
is 5-card draw, sir.

22:50.168 --> 22:53.069
Pot limit.
Minimum bet is $5,000.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.581
Okay.

23:03.582 --> 23:06.983
Dahlgren's got a pair of jacks
and an ace kicker.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.816
I always start off modestly.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.388
It leaves me room
to get out of hand.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.158
$50,000.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.345
Bets, please.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.080
In case you're wondering,

23:36.081 --> 23:38.581
I draw an inside straight.

23:41.853 --> 23:45.186
$ 120,000.

23:54.966 --> 23:57.466
Not my hand.

23:57.536 --> 24:00.036
Hmm.

24:03.975 --> 24:07.103
Americans.
Them really gullible.

24:11.516 --> 24:14.016
Good evening.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.191
Francie, what are you doing?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.625
Oh, no.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.494
Oh, no, no.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.262
Oh, please, no.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.166
Dixon, listen.

24:29.167 --> 24:31.667
Hold on the switch.
Play a few more hands.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.671
Let him get to know
your poker face.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.672
If this is okay,

24:34.673 --> 24:37.074
if I can go radio silent
for two minutes,

24:37.075 --> 24:39.575
clear your throat.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.852
Going radio silent.

24:47.853 --> 24:50.515
Thank you kindly.

24:50.589 --> 24:53.752
If you'll just sign the bride
and groom's registry...

24:57.329 --> 24:59.497
Hey!

24:59.498 --> 25:00.130
Hey!

25:00.131 --> 25:02.631
I was finishing my meeting
across the casino,

25:02.667 --> 25:04.335
and I saw you guys.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.870
What are you doing here?

25:05.871 --> 25:08.371
I know we made a deal,
but I bought the tickets anyway.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.441
No, what are you doing here?

25:10.442 --> 25:13.411
Are you guys getting married?

25:13.478 --> 25:14.512
I know it sounds crazy.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.247
No, no.
I totally get it.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.308
I called you.
Will you be our witness?

25:21.553 --> 25:27.788
I need to talk to Charlie
privately for two seconds.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.359
Okay.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.664
What's up?

25:33.665 --> 25:35.499
I met a friend of yours today.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.567
Who?

25:36.568 --> 25:39.068
Stella Campbell.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.239
So...

25:42.240 --> 25:44.241
how's Stella doing?

25:44.242 --> 25:47.700
Does Francie know anything about
your relationship with her?

25:53.118 --> 25:54.385
You and I are friends.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.720
I have nothing against you
going into this.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.952
I swear to God, if you marry
Francie without telling her

25:59.991 --> 26:02.551
what you've been up to,
I will kill you.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.795
- Sydney.
- No discussion.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.822
You don't tell her, I will.
You got it?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.734
Yeah.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.938
Yeah, I got it.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.173
Tell Francie
I had to get back to work.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.674
I'll call her later.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.281
Number of cards, please?

26:24.282 --> 26:26.782
Give me two cards, man.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.454
What the hell?

26:30.455 --> 26:32.955
I'm out of here after this.

26:33.491 --> 26:35.991
I'll take three.

26:36.227 --> 26:39.196
My friend,
the night's still young.

26:39.264 --> 26:42.529
The night began
$86,000 ago, my friend.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.207
Hey, what's wrong?
Where's Sydney?

26:50.208 --> 26:52.708
Fran, we got to talk.

26:56.247 --> 26:57.314
Yeah.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.815
Sir, we have a problem.

26:59.818 --> 27:01.819
We can't get married like this.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.120
Why not?

27:03.121 --> 27:04.622
I want to do it right.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.524
With all our friends
and family there.

27:07.592 --> 27:10.092
Don't you?

27:12.864 --> 27:14.999
I'll see you $ 10,000...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.500
and raise $ 15,000...

27:18.269 --> 27:20.769
which is all the chips
I have left.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.174
I see your raise,

27:24.175 --> 27:27.406
and to show you
that I'm not a greedy man,

27:27.479 --> 27:30.744
I will raise you
something personal.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.616
This.

27:32.617 --> 27:36.246
A gift from King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.090
Got this watch.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.055
I have a watch.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.629
But I don't have no ring.

27:47.632 --> 27:50.260
My fraternity ring?

27:50.335 --> 27:52.202
It's not worth anything.

27:52.203 --> 27:54.405
If it's worth something
to you,

27:54.406 --> 27:56.906
it's worth something to me.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.682
Dixon, I'm back.

28:09.821 --> 28:13.279
Screw it.
This is my last hand anyway.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.660
Dahlgren's got a flush.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.757
You're gonna lose.
You got to make the switch now.

28:23.902 --> 28:26.462
Three wise men.

28:32.277 --> 28:34.777
Flush.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.951
Thanks for a good game, man.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.891
Dixon, something's wrong.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.392
The floor manager's coming
to your suite with security.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.133
Sir, I have an urgent
message for you.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.701
Will you follow me
outside, please?

28:57.702 --> 29:00.202
Yes, of course.

29:03.508 --> 29:06.008
Hold on!
What is the meaning of this?

29:06.111 --> 29:08.841
Your attaché just called.

29:08.913 --> 29:12.349
Apparently,
you're stuck in Jamaica.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.544
I suppose there are
worse places to be stuck.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.056
Dixon!

29:36.141 --> 29:38.641
So we're down $300...

29:38.743 --> 29:42.201
I kept looking for you,
hoping you'd give us some luck.

29:42.313 --> 29:43.480
Thank God you didn't,

29:43.481 --> 29:45.149
because this huge lady
with yellow hair

29:45.150 --> 29:46.817
sits right next to me
from heaven.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.548
All of a sudden,
we are on a huge streak.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.622
How much did you win?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.056
$2,000.

29:53.057 --> 29:54.124
Wow!

29:54.125 --> 29:56.293
Look what he bought me.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.594
Isn't it pretty?

29:57.595 --> 30:00.587
Yeah, it's really sweet.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.366
What did you say to Charlie
about not getting married?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.341
What did he tell you
that I said?

30:11.342 --> 30:12.543
He didn't.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.378
I just wanted to thank you.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.680
You know me,
Miss Spontaneous.

30:16.681 --> 30:19.206
I would have regretted
getting married there.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.784
It was stupid.

30:27.091 --> 30:30.583
I don't know how to say this
without it being horrible...

30:31.529 --> 30:34.692
but I ran into this girl
on campus...

30:34.766 --> 30:38.668
who said that she had
an affair with Charlie...

30:38.736 --> 30:40.704
two months ago.

30:40.705 --> 30:43.367
Francie, I am so sorry.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.642
What are you talking about?

30:45.643 --> 30:47.110
Who is this girl?

30:47.111 --> 30:50.080
Her name was Stella.
I don't know.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.815
- You don't even know her?
- No.

30:51.816 --> 30:54.084
That's so unlike you,
to believe a stranger.

30:54.085 --> 30:56.781
- Wait. I like Charlie.
- No, you don't.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.488
Francie, when have I ever
said or done...

30:58.489 --> 31:01.686
You have not been supportive
of us getting married at all!

31:01.759 --> 31:03.193
You don't know this girl!

31:03.194 --> 31:05.719
- Is this what you told Charlie?
- Yes, and he didn't deny it.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.297
He didn't admit it,
though, did he?

31:09.434 --> 31:11.934
No, he didn't.

31:16.841 --> 31:21.107
Sydney, there are a lot of
things that we haven't

31:21.179 --> 31:23.080
said to each other lately.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.314
Like what?

31:24.315 --> 31:25.549
I knew you didn't like Charlie

31:25.550 --> 31:27.551
when you didn't show up
to look at wedding dresses.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.119
That was only about work.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.681
I'm so sick
of your stupid bank job!

31:32.757 --> 31:34.391
Ever since
you started working there,

31:34.392 --> 31:37.919
you've been elitist
and private and distant.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.967
You've let me live here,
and that's fine,

31:43.968 --> 31:46.336
but you and I were closer
when I lived with Charlie,

31:46.337 --> 31:48.837
which is where
I should have stayed.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.975
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.476
And I don't want to.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.326
That is tough.

32:09.327 --> 32:12.057
It was more than tough.
It was revealing.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.231
Not just about Charlie,
but about us.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.599
What do you mean? It's more
than just Francie and Charlie?

32:19.337 --> 32:21.805
I don't know if she's gonna
want to be my friend.

32:21.806 --> 32:24.107
Syd, look...

32:24.108 --> 32:26.804
you just gave her
the worst news of her life.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.712
How do you expect her to react?

32:28.713 --> 32:31.213
Yeah. I guess.

32:33.084 --> 32:34.685
How many more hickeys
have you got?

32:34.686 --> 32:36.186
Shut up.

32:36.187 --> 32:37.387
Just asking.

32:39.991 --> 32:42.619
I got to do an interview,
anyway.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.761
Listen, it's gonna be fine.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.262
I'll call you later.

32:48.566 --> 32:49.866
Hello?

32:49.867 --> 32:51.468
It's me.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.437
Your trip to Vegas
was a success.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.905
I just thought you should know.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.406
Well, that's good.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.542
We intercepted
a phone call to Dahlgren

32:58.543 --> 32:59.910
off the transmitter you planted.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.745
Linguistics
is translating it now.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.647
Is there anything I can do?

33:03.648 --> 33:06.049
If you have the time...

33:06.050 --> 33:08.550
I'd like you
to meet me somewhere.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.824
So, why are we at a carousel?

33:17.895 --> 33:20.395
You always loved this spot.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.334
Your mother and I
used to bring you here.

33:27.572 --> 33:31.565
I had just been transferred
to the Los Angeles field office.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.176
You were 2 years old.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.513
We'd watch you go around
on the carousel and...

33:40.585 --> 33:43.020
talk about our day...

33:43.021 --> 33:46.047
the future...

33:46.124 --> 33:49.924
and, sometimes, foolishly,
my work at the CIA.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.994
I never imagined
that our conversations

33:55.066 --> 33:57.694
were being passed along
to the KGB.

34:04.008 --> 34:06.841
I haven't been back
to this park in 20 years.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.480
Why did you bring me here now?

34:13.985 --> 34:16.954
When you asked me
the other day about school...

34:18.956 --> 34:21.456
I couldn't help you.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.328
I'm out of practice...

34:26.330 --> 34:29.128
when it comes to
personal matters.

34:30.568 --> 34:34.025
Dad, I'm in no rush.

34:36.873 --> 34:38.875
Believing your mother
was a professor

34:38.876 --> 34:42.039
may have influenced you
somewhat, but...

34:44.047 --> 34:46.880
the decision
to go back to school...

34:46.951 --> 34:49.286
was yours.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.786
And I'd trust that.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.924
I think that...

34:57.895 --> 35:00.395
if you stick with it...

35:01.532 --> 35:03.366
you could become
the kind of teacher

35:03.367 --> 35:05.867
your students
will always remember.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.873
Thank you.

35:29.527 --> 35:33.088
Linguistics successfully
decoded Dahlgren's phone call,

35:33.164 --> 35:35.265
but we still don't know
who the mystery agency is

35:35.266 --> 35:36.399
or who's behind it.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.767
Learning that information

35:37.768 --> 35:41.670
and getting a visual I.D. Of
"The Man" is our top priority.

35:41.739 --> 35:45.140
I'm tired of referring to him
as "The Man. "

35:45.209 --> 35:47.077
I want to know who he is.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.211
The meeting with K-Directorate

35:48.212 --> 35:50.313
is scheduled to take place
20 hours from now

35:50.314 --> 35:51.915
at an office building
in Moscow.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.850
Your mission is
to surveil the meeting

35:53.851 --> 35:55.285
in hopes of obtaining
information

35:55.286 --> 35:57.786
that leads us to "The Man. "

36:02.326 --> 36:03.994
This is a flash memory card.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.062
It's compatible
with the fiber optic camera

36:06.063 --> 36:08.098
you'll be using
in the K-Directorate meeting.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.033
On your flight home,
just leave it in the plane.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.568
Seat pocket, 15-C.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.937
One of our agents
will pick it up.

36:13.938 --> 36:16.406
15-C.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.907
Yeah.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.111
Last week, when you talked
about quitting SD-6...

36:21.112 --> 36:22.612
I was being naive.

36:22.613 --> 36:27.573
No, what you said about wanting
to go to a hockey game...

36:27.652 --> 36:30.152
wanting me to be
part of your life...

36:30.221 --> 36:32.721
I think I wasn't
clear about something.

36:36.494 --> 36:39.793
That it would be nice
to be in public with you,

36:39.864 --> 36:42.364
to actually
get to look at you.

36:47.004 --> 36:49.700
Grab a pizza
or go to a hockey game.

36:49.807 --> 36:52.307
I wasn't clear that

36:52.310 --> 36:54.810
I would really like that,
too.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.821
Good luck in Russia.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.065
Hey.

37:49.066 --> 37:51.566
Hey.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.336
Where have you been?

37:54.338 --> 37:56.838
Three movies.

38:04.815 --> 38:07.315
Charlie told me everything.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.477
I think everything.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.990
You were right.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.361
<i># You bring me #</i>

38:18.362 --> 38:22.958
<i># To the heart
of a golden man #</i>

38:23.034 --> 38:25.268
<i># You bring me #</i>

38:25.269 --> 38:26.870
<i># To the natural truth #</i>

38:26.871 --> 38:29.840
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

38:31.609 --> 38:34.109
I feel so stupid.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.241
And I'm so sorry I said
all of those things to you.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.817
It's okay.

38:45.790 --> 38:49.123
You know I'm on your side,
right?

38:49.193 --> 38:51.693
Thank God.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.737
You're dropping a class?

39:06.043 --> 39:07.010
No.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.423
How's it hanging, Syd?

39:53.424 --> 39:55.924
Very funny.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.563
We're on. They're heading
toward the building now.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.887
Fiber optic camera is hot.

41:00.090 --> 41:02.590
Okay, Syd, we're live.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.292
Okay. Going for audio.

41:23.714 --> 41:25.849
Gentlemen, welcome.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.944
I'm Mr. Sark.
Director of Operations.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.191
On behalf of my employer...

41:35.192 --> 41:37.692
Who is your employer?

41:39.196 --> 41:40.864
Certainly, he doesn't expect us

41:40.865 --> 41:44.028
to continue referring to him
as "The Man. "

41:44.101 --> 41:45.535
I'm afraid my employer's
identity will have to

41:45.536 --> 41:47.370
remain confidential for now.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.539
This is no way to begin
a negotiation.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.374
My employer sends
his apologies, Comrade Ivankov,

41:53.444 --> 41:56.743
and has authorized me
to detail our proposal,

41:56.814 --> 41:58.448
with your approval.

41:58.449 --> 42:01.441
You seem young
for such responsibility.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.922
My employer's offer is simple.

42:05.923 --> 42:10.656
We will transfer $ 100 million
into your Cayman shell account.

42:10.728 --> 42:13.754
Number A6112B.

42:13.831 --> 42:17.358
Sydney, that isn't
a K-Directorate representative.

42:17.434 --> 42:20.801
It's llyich Ivankov,
the head of K-Directorate.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.539
How did you know that number?

42:22.540 --> 42:25.509
In exchange, you will give us
the Rambaldi manuscript

42:25.576 --> 42:27.477
you recently acquired
in Argentina

42:27.478 --> 42:29.978
and whatever analysis
you made of its content.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.052
$ 100 million.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.954
That's quite an opening offer.

42:37.955 --> 42:39.989
It is a final offer.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.652
We both know the Rambaldi
manuscript is priceless.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.327
Therefore, it's not for sale.

42:44.328 --> 42:48.059
I've been authorized to tell you
that this offer expires

42:48.132 --> 42:50.632
in 60 seconds.

42:52.436 --> 42:53.770
Is this a joke?

42:53.771 --> 42:56.271
55 seconds.

42:58.309 --> 42:59.842
You tell your employer,

42:59.843 --> 43:02.869
if he ever wastes my time
like this again,

43:02.947 --> 43:05.447
our next meeting
will not be so cordial.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.899
Congratulations, Comrade Kessar.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.867
You have
just inherited control

43:24.868 --> 43:27.103
of the indestructible
K- Directorate.

43:27.104 --> 43:30.073
You've also inherited
what I hope is, by now,

43:30.140 --> 43:31.841
a very simple decision.

43:31.842 --> 43:34.043
The offer still stands.

43:34.044 --> 43:36.446
Unfortunately, you...

43:36.447 --> 43:39.075
only have 20 seconds
left to decide.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.790
We...

43:50.628 --> 43:53.128
We have an agreement.

43:54.031 --> 43:56.531
My employer
will be so pleased.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.844
Sydney!

44:19.456 --> 44:21.956
Sydney!
