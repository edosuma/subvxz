CHRIS ROCK:
As much as I loved
growing up in Bed-Stuy,

00:03.471 --> 00:06.407
the place I loved even more
was down South.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.410
After segregation and before
the 2 Live Crew, down South

00:09.443 --> 00:11.312
was good, and the weather
was always beautiful.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.414
Hey, Mom, when are we
going down South again?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.616
When the Klan breaks up.
I don't know, baby.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.151
That'll be nice.
Hey, Ma.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.352
Who's that?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.788
Oh, that's your
Cousin Beanie!

00:20.821 --> 00:22.223
You know what, she's
12, just like you.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.258
Except Cousin Beanie's
not evil.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.793
You know what,
maybe we should plan

00:25.826 --> 00:26.827
a trip down South.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.163
I don't like down South;
people act too country.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.199
They're not acting.
Well, I wish
I could go.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.101
Well, Drew and Tonya,
you guys get washed up.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.602
We're about to eat.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.606
Hey!
Hey!

00:38.639 --> 00:39.607
Hey!

00:39.640 --> 00:40.574
Hey, little man.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.775
Hey, Uncle Louis!

00:41.809 --> 00:43.111
Hey.
Hey.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.413
Hi

00:45.446 --> 00:47.815
Uh

00:47.848 --> 00:49.850
LOUIS:
I just found out
that Uncle Morris died.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.419
Uncle Morris?

00:51.452 --> 00:53.087
Yeah. He taught me how to drive.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.322
Well, who was
Uncle Morris?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.224
He's my mother's sister's
second husband.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.259
A stick shift.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.094
Oh, baby.
Well, when's the funeral?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.162
Next week.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.330
Down South.
Oh.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.831
I don't think we can go.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.766
Baby, what do you
mean, we can't go?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.301
We can't afford to go.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.670
You can't put a price tag
on family, Julius.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.472
Yeah, but he'll give you
five dollars to shut up.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.707
Louis is right.
Family is family, baby.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.809
Family is family.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.678
So we're going down South?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.113
Yep.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.614
Thanks, Uncle Morris.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.691
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
Back at school, I tried
to bring Greg up to speed

01:56.517 --> 01:58.352
on the new direction
of the South.
Down South?

01:58.386 --> 01:59.687
You mean, like, across
the Mason

01:59.720 --> 02:02.790
Yeah, you know, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi,
South Carolina.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.624
Mississippi?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.793
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.928
You going to Mississippi
is like me going to,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.730
hmm, I don't know,
Mississippi.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.565
Man, it's not
like that anymore.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.467
Yes, it is.
Anyway, I
want to go.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.802
Down South, the
food is better.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.838
The cops don't beat
the crap out of you,
and nobody's on crack.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.773
That's because everybody's
on the porch.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.642
Well, I'm sorry
about your uncle, man.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.777
I'll see you
when you get back.
All right.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.747
Before you could buy
plane tickets on the Internet,

02:26.780 --> 02:29.350
the cheapest way to travel
was to take Greyhound.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.551
How's it going?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.919
Well, they've only got
two busses

02:31.952 --> 02:33.854
that go to Greenville,
South Carolina.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.257
The cheaper one goes
to Camden, Portsmouth,

02:36.290 --> 02:38.426
Baltimore, Richmond,
Baltimore again,

02:38.459 --> 02:40.894
Raleigh, Toledo, Gastonia...
Darryl Richardson's house,

02:40.928 --> 02:42.530
What?
Boston,

02:42.563 --> 02:44.265
the Crossroads, Atlanta,
then Greenville.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.734
Well, does the other bus
make less stops? Oh!

02:46.767 --> 02:49.870
Yeah, but it costs
almost $200 more.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.672
Well, why don't we just drive?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.407
I love a road trip.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.843
What, are... you going with us?

02:55.876 --> 02:59.647
:
Well, how else am I supposed
to get there, silly?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.549
You want to...

03:01.582 --> 03:02.783
* Superman!

03:02.816 --> 03:04.652
Blink!
Yes, master.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.922
Well, I-I just assumed
you'd be flying-- I mean...

03:08.956 --> 03:10.924
you don't want to be
on no bus with us.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.826
Are you kidding?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.462
I love the bus!

03:15.529 --> 03:16.864
Man, I get
to spend time

03:16.897 --> 03:18.466
with my big brother
and his family,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.868
see the sights,
meet new people,
and best of all,

03:20.901 --> 03:22.970
sing-alongs.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.305
Sing it with me.

03:24.338 --> 03:28.542
* Now I lay me down
to sleep, bow! *

03:30.043 --> 03:32.446
* Whoo! I just can't

03:32.480 --> 03:33.747
BOTH:
* Find the beat

03:33.781 --> 03:35.949
* Flashlight, light

03:37.985 --> 03:39.987
* Now, Neon light...
Take the bass part.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.456
BOTH :
* Neon light...

03:44.592 --> 03:47.561
Um, uh, Julius, can you
come upstairs with me

03:47.595 --> 03:49.930
for a second?
He can if Uncle Louis
isn't coming.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.600
* La, da, da

03:52.633 --> 03:54.868
(Louis continues humming,
imitating bass)

03:54.902 --> 03:56.804
What is wrong with you?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.038
Do you hear that?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.941
* Everybody's got
a little light *

04:00.974 --> 04:03.377
:
* Under the sun,
under the sun... *

04:03.411 --> 04:05.012
That's what's
wrong with me.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.582
Look, I'm not gonna
spend 26 hours on a bus
with my brother.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.584
I love him, but
he drives me nuts.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.353
Baby, why? I mean,
he's always laughing

04:12.386 --> 04:14.655
and smiling
and in a good mood.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.391
Exactly. And while
he's having fun, you
know what I'm doing?

04:17.425 --> 04:19.059
Working. Look, look.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.895
* Everybody's got a little...
I'm not trying
to be unreasonable,

04:21.929 --> 04:23.864
but I just
cannot take it.
Okay...

04:23.897 --> 04:26.033
Baby, look,
I can't take it.
All right, I got you.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.969
* Under the sun, under...
Just calm down.
I'll handle it.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.071
After my mother convinced
my Uncle Louis to fly,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.907
we headed to Port Authority,
the only place in New York

04:33.941 --> 04:37.711
scarier than our neighborhood.
Okay, I want y'all to be
real careful in here.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.381
This place is full of
pickpockets, pimps and...

04:40.414 --> 04:42.916
and-and murderers and
child molesters and thieves.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.785
That's the Port Authority
slogan.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.320
Rochelle, don't scare 'em.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.220
Too late.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.989
Julius, this place
is full of hustlers

04:49.022 --> 04:51.359
trying to prey
on innocent people.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.826
She said the same thing

04:52.860 --> 04:55.028
when we visited Washington, DC.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.865
So that's why I decided
to divide our money

04:57.898 --> 04:59.500
between me,
you and Chris.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.634
You did?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.937
Yeah. So just in case
somebody pickpockets one of us,

05:03.971 --> 05:05.439
they won't get us all.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.340
Well, where'd you put it?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.008
:
It's in your shirt pocket.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.042
Don't look

05:09.076 --> 05:10.778
for it now!

05:10.811 --> 05:13.080
Hey, there's the gate
right there.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.449
Don't touch anything.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.751
And don't make eye contact
with strangers.

05:17.785 --> 05:21.088
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:21.121 --> 05:23.891
:
Please check the board
for updates.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.994
MAN :
Two security guards
report to Gate 4.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.796
Two security guards
report to...

05:28.829 --> 05:31.064
This pocket doesn't open.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.501
Oh, well,
I sewed the top closed,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.569
and I left it open on the side.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.938
Star Jones had that done
to her stomach.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.007
Ma, I'm hungry.
Can we get a snack?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.542
Are you nuts?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.577
Have you seen the rats
in this place?

05:43.611 --> 05:45.112
Let's just go home
and eat there.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.747
Same rats, different borough.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.417
Okay, okay, we'll get something
from the vending machines.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.084
I'll go get the tickets.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.621
All right, well, Chris,
get these bags together, okay?

05:53.654 --> 05:54.888
We'll be right back.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.724
Keep your eyes open.
And put the money

05:56.757 --> 05:58.692
away, boy!
Come on.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.465
TONYA:
Oh, Ma, TV seats!
Can we watch, please?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.567
Okay, we got time
for one show,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.469
and then we got
to go back.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.471
Me first.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.806
Well, let me get some change.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.781
It's broken.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.150
Well, didn't you see me

06:23.183 --> 06:25.419
about to put money
in there?
Yeah.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.989
Well, why didn't you
say something?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.491
Ain't that how it goes.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.527
Ma, this TV doesn't work.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.096
Miss, my bus is leaving
for Fort Lauderdale soon.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.965
You can have my seat then.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.767
Thank you so much.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.001
Eh, it's not a problem.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.806
Como esta, everybody?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.007
Top o' the morning to you.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.075
Top o' the day.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.577
Wherever you think
you're going,

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
tiempo para jugar!

06:51.011 --> 06:53.013
It's time to play.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.483
Ladies and gentlemen,
I got three cards here.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.217
You guys got courage?
You know what luck is?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.019
Luck is opportunity
and preparedness

06:59.052 --> 07:00.120
coming together as one.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.789
And I'm prepared.
Are you?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.725
Three simple cards-- you tell me
which one's it gonna be?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.727
Can you find the jack?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.496
It's all about this
jack, and if you pick

07:08.529 --> 07:10.030
the right one out
of these three cards,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.565
you can win some
money right now.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.966
Come on, sir, I feel
your intensity over there.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.367
"Hmm, I could win some money,
I could get my wife

07:14.401 --> 07:17.070
a nice little present;
I could bring it on
the bus when I see her."

07:17.104 --> 07:19.473
Come on. Here we go.
What you got for me?

07:19.507 --> 07:21.008
You got to find
this jack. You ready?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.843
It's all about what you see
and what you saw.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.911
Where's the jack, sir?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.212
Uh, ten bucks right here.

07:25.245 --> 07:25.979
Right there, huh?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.581
Let's turn that
over. Pa-pow!

07:27.615 --> 07:29.016
Ten dollars.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.484
This man's a winner, everybody.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.986
This man's a winner, and
I over here am a giver.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.022
There you go, sir--
lucky man, lucky man, indeed.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.857
We're gonna start it
up and running again.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
We're talking about...

07:38.559 --> 07:39.727
the jack, where's the jack?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.229
I'm pretty sure
it's out on the end.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.197
What about you, man, you want
to jump in on this? Here we go.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.800
Oh...!

07:46.834 --> 07:48.536
Money, money goes around,

07:48.569 --> 07:50.504
money, money,
can it be found?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.006
Congratulations. We gonna
keep this dance going.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.577
Little man,
why don't you play?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.879
Nah. I'm not allowed to gamble.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.113
Aw, this ain't gambling.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.181
This is easy. You
can handle this.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.051
See these three
little cards?
I'll show you

08:04.084 --> 08:05.085
what it's all about, see?

08:05.118 --> 08:08.088
All you have to do
is see if you... can pick...

08:08.121 --> 08:11.024
the right... card.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.225
Where's the right card?

08:14.227 --> 08:16.063
There.
Little man.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.565
I'm on him.
What's up,
little man,

08:17.598 --> 08:19.232
you want to put a
little money on that?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.002
It would've been great to take
the quicker bus down South,

08:22.035 --> 08:24.137
and even though
my mind said, "Don't do it,"

08:24.171 --> 08:26.540
my mouth said...
$20.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.241
WOMAN:
$20 on the young man.

08:28.275 --> 08:32.112
All right. Why don't you
turn that card over.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.081
Yeah!

08:34.114 --> 08:35.783
I knew I wasn't supposed
to gamble,

08:35.816 --> 08:38.085
but I was doing it
for a good cause,

08:38.118 --> 08:39.920
and I was winning.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.622
Oh, man!

08:41.655 --> 08:43.256
Shuffle the cards
and where's the jack?

08:43.290 --> 08:45.793
Turn it over, little
man. Turn it over.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.861
Yeah! All right!

08:47.895 --> 08:49.096
You cannot lose!

08:49.129 --> 08:52.600
There you go-- the money is
being passed around, everybody.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.567
Can you feel it?

08:53.601 --> 08:54.835
There's a jack in here.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.103
You need to tell me,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.571
where is it?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.773
$50.
I'll match you.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.175
I'm there, I'm there.
WOMAN:
He has not lost.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.243
You sure?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.613
Hundred dollars
says you're wrong.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.216
I don't have a hundred.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.219
Whatcha got?
$80.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.254
Throw it down.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.658
$80.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.092
This was gonna be easy money.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.994
Turn it over.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.299
WOMAN:
Oh, my Lord.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.206
I got jacked
with a deck of cards.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.346
* Everybody's got
a little light *

09:39.379 --> 09:41.882
* Under the sun,
under the sun *

09:41.915 --> 09:43.116
* Under the sun

09:43.150 --> 09:44.818
:
* Oh, flashlight

09:44.852 --> 09:45.953
Uncle Louis?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.254
No, it's Bootsy Collins.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.289
* Flashlight...

09:49.322 --> 09:51.391
Come on, man, are you okay?

09:51.424 --> 09:54.327
Yeah. I thought
you were flying to the funeral.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.197
Oh, yeah, but the weather
was so bad that they
cancelled my flight,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.266
so I decided to ride
the bus with you.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.169
Excuse you.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.336
Sheesh!

10:03.370 --> 10:05.005
Hey, where's the big man?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.239
Oh, he's out
getting the tickets.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.742
Oh, cool. Hey, can you
go find him and tell him
to get me one?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.410
Yeah, but can you
watch the bags?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.213
Absolutely. Oh, and
if you see your mom,
tell her I'm here.

10:13.246 --> 10:17.217
I'll try to get the words out
while she's choking me.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.792
* Now I lay me
down to sleep... *

10:26.459 --> 10:28.729
As hard as my father worked
for his money,

10:28.762 --> 10:30.397
I couldn't tell him
I got taken,

10:30.430 --> 10:33.100
so I decided to get the money
back on my own...

10:33.133 --> 10:34.835
by any means necessary.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.737
Watch your bags
as you go to the bathroom.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.805
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.706
Watch your bags...

10:38.739 --> 10:41.408
Hey. Come on now.
You know it's not yours.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.911
Take a picture with a black kid.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.214
What?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.149
Warm your gloves.
Glove-warming.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.429
Oh, no, terrible.
Oh, this is horrible.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.331
What's he doing?
No rhythm.

11:06.066 --> 11:06.666
Can I help you?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.435
Yeah, I need five tickets;

11:08.468 --> 11:10.437
two adults, three children

11:10.470 --> 11:12.706
to Greenville, South Carolina
leaving at 8:30.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.907
That bus is delayed.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.343
I know, but whatever time
it's leaving

11:16.376 --> 11:17.845
I'm still gonna need tickets.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.445
Where are they?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.380
Who?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.315
The children. I can't sell you
children's tickets

11:22.349 --> 11:23.316
unless I see the children.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.052
Why not?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.386
Because what if they're adults?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.388
Lady, I am not running a scam.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.057
I need to go to a funeral.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.458
Sorry to hear that.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.093
I still need to see the kids.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.428
Ma'am, I've been waiting in line
almost an hour.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.865
And you didn't have time
to go get the children.

11:37.898 --> 11:44.471
Lady, I am buying bus tickets
to Greenville, South Carolina.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.874
Now that has to be
the worst scam on Earth.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.909
Now, if I am
that desperate

11:48.942 --> 11:50.377
to get out of New York City,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.179
you don't want me
hanging around,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.247
especially around the time
you get off.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.382
Is that a threat?

11:55.415 --> 11:59.052
Let's just say it's a scenario.

11:59.086 --> 12:03.290
Two adults, three kids.
That's $180.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.992
They said it was $120.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.060
That was our Underground
Railroad special.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.261
It's been discontinued.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.430
How much
are slave ship tickets?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.303
Chris.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.404
Get out of the way, huh?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.505
Hey, Dad.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.008
Who's watching our stuff?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.009
Uncle Louis.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.410
Uncle Louis is here?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.378
What'd he do, get kicked off
the plane for singing?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.781
No, his flight got canceled,
so he wants to ride with us.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.316
He wants you
to buy him a ticket.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.350
Buy him a ticket?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.452
I don't have enough money
to buy our tickets.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.087
How come

12:34.121 --> 12:35.088
Forget about it.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.024
Just give me the money
your mother gave you.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.493
Excuse me.
I'll be back in five years.

12:40.527 --> 12:44.031
Oh, um, I don't have it.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.033
What do you mean
you don't have it?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.267
What happened to it?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.104
The best thing
about having two parents

12:51.138 --> 12:53.306
is that usually one of them
wants you to live.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.075
But my father
could only help me

12:55.108 --> 12:56.176
if I told the truth.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.277
Three-card monte.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.046
Chris, I'm gonna get
that money back.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.480
Yo, here we go. Bang!

13:00.513 --> 13:03.550
Had your eyes on the prize!

13:03.583 --> 13:05.585
Jacks to be found,
I'm throwing the money down.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.554
Money coming out
to the players.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.389
You want to keep winning,
ring around the rosy.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.492
You got to find the jack
and you're gonna win the crown.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.427
Make your money stack
and find the jack.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.462
Place your bets.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.196
It's right there.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.364
Are you sure?
Place your bets.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.432
Positive.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.434
I got $50 on it.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.838
Oh. $100 says that you wrong.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.040
Are you sure that's the card?

13:27.074 --> 13:28.108
Yeah.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.378
Here we go.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.212
There you go.

13:32.245 --> 13:36.183
Take a bat.
Show me where it's at.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.419
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.355
Don't frown.
Don't frown.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.524
This is the kind of experience

13:44.557 --> 13:46.526
that brings a father and son
closer...

13:46.559 --> 13:47.928
closer to death.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.201
The only thing my father
hated more than losing money

13:54.234 --> 13:55.202
was borrowing money.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.469
Three

13:56.503 --> 13:59.172
Yeah, we thought
we had the jack.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.574
Look, look, I'm sorry, bro.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.344
I just don't have that much
on me right now.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.212
Come on, man.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.513
Uncle Morris taught you
how to drive.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.515
Stick shift.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.318
Sorry.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.326
The rain had fallen,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.528
butthe storm
was just about to hit.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.966
Y'all acting like
somebody else died.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.034
What happened?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.068
ALL:
Oh, nothing!

14:28.101 --> 14:30.337
Everything's all right,
you know.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.073
I just want
a hug...

14:33.106 --> 14:34.641
from Tonya!

14:34.674 --> 14:37.377
Hey!
Yeah!

14:37.410 --> 14:38.578
You're so funny.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.214
Why y'all acting all suspicious?

14:41.248 --> 14:42.015
I'm not acting suspicious.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.483
I was over there,
but now here.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.919
But we're cool.
Just having

14:45.953 --> 14:48.021
some good times, you know?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.560
Don't make me have
to get it out of you.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.196
Okay, I played three-card monte

14:56.229 --> 14:58.065
and I lost all the money
that you gave me to hold.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.566
Then I tried to win it back

14:59.599 --> 15:01.368
and I lost the rest
of the money.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.105
I-I didn't do anything.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.612
Gambling?!

15:18.718 --> 15:21.621
How many times do I have
to tell y'all about gambling?

15:21.654 --> 15:22.522
Quick, sing "Flashlight"!

15:22.555 --> 15:24.257
* Flashlight...

15:26.293 --> 15:28.428
WOMAN :
Please do not leave luggage
unattended.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.596
What are you doing here anyway?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.599
Hey, does that mean we don't
have to go to the funeral?

15:32.632 --> 15:33.500
No.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.435
We're going.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.171
Drew, do you still know
those kill moves?

15:38.205 --> 15:39.706
Yeah.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.474
If anybody tries
to touch your sister

15:41.508 --> 15:43.376
or take our bags,

15:43.410 --> 15:44.577
kill 'em.

15:45.778 --> 15:50.950
You, you and you,
come with me.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.390
Hey, Rachelle, maybe
you should think about this.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.391
I thought about it.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.726
Rachelle, this guy's
really good.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.628
I don't want us
to lose any more money

16:01.661 --> 16:02.629
than we already have.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.630
He's good, huh?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.298
Yeah, he's really good.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.334
Or maybe you just suck.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.535
Listen, when I was little,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.603
my father taught me
all these scams.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.739
Three-card monte
was his favorite.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.408
Honey, when it comes
to three-card monte,

16:15.442 --> 16:18.145
you cannot win
the game.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.446
Why not?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.482
Because I always know
where the card is.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.317
But even if they pick
the right card,

16:24.351 --> 16:29.522
I just keep raising the bet
till they get scared.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.460
Oh, too bad!

16:33.493 --> 16:35.595
But what if I pick
the wrong card?

16:35.628 --> 16:42.469
Then I let you bet
everything you got.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.671
Oh, tough break.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.707
What if I don't want to play?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.777
Nobody ever wants to play.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.681
That's how come I got Rudy
and Debra over there.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.183
They're shills.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.517
Shills?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.452
Well, they act like
they don't know each other.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.354
So in order to get
the game started,

17:01.388 --> 17:02.789
they best first.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.192
So him and her?

17:05.225 --> 17:07.260
Yeah. They're
the shills.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.829
Here we go!

17:09.862 --> 17:11.631
What if somebody bets
on the right card

17:11.664 --> 17:13.600
and doesn't get scared
when you keep raising the bet?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.603
Now, honey, this is a very
important lesson right here.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.438
We run!

17:20.240 --> 17:22.509
Okay, you guys, all we need
is one good bet.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.710
What are we gonna bet?

17:23.743 --> 17:24.777
We don't have any money.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.380
You don't have any money.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.448
Where'd you get all that?

17:28.481 --> 17:29.616
Shouldn't I be saying that?

17:29.649 --> 17:30.250
Sorry.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.651
Where'd you get all that?

17:31.684 --> 17:33.853
It's from my emergency fund.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.156
If my father had ever thought
to say,

17:36.189 --> 17:38.658
"Quick, who's got $200?
It's an emergency,"

17:38.691 --> 17:40.827
she would have given it to him.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.495
All right, you guys. Let's go.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.198
You think
it's right there?

17:45.232 --> 17:46.499
You think it's that
right there?

17:46.533 --> 17:47.767
Here we go.
Here we go.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.736
Okay, Julius,
you go over there.

17:49.769 --> 17:50.870
Louis, you stay here.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.406
If he try to run,
be ready.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.442
Chris, you come with me.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.809
Take my advice,
don't blink twice.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.278
Pick that jack,

17:58.311 --> 17:58.811
get your money back.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.746
You, sir.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.381
I saw it.
It's this one
right here.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.782
You over there?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.117
It's that one.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.785
Little man back.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.687
You got some
more money?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.688
No.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.789
But I do.

18:09.822 --> 18:10.757
Who are you?

18:10.790 --> 18:14.561
I'm his mother,
and I got $50 on that card.

18:16.463 --> 18:20.233
I got a hundred
that says that you're wrong.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.303
I got $200 that says I'm right.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.809
Turn the card over, Mother.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.777
No, wait.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.512
Oh-oh-oh, wait!

18:32.545 --> 18:33.780
Now we wanna wait.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.915
I bet you want to run, too.
See,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.250
that's my husband over there

18:37.284 --> 18:38.885
and that's his brother
back there,

18:38.918 --> 18:42.422
so you can run,
but you're not gonna get far.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.158
You got to ask
yourself one question:

18:45.192 --> 18:47.227
Is today your lucky day?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.761
Doubt it,

18:48.795 --> 18:49.896
punk.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.300
Now give me my damn money back!

18:54.701 --> 18:56.636
Hurry!

18:56.669 --> 18:58.771
And the cards, too!
Give me the cards!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.273
Just take it.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.674
Come on, Chris.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.913
We got back the money,

19:06.946 --> 19:09.148
but there was still
one problem.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.721
Hey, where is everybody?

19:14.754 --> 19:15.888
The bus left.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.823
What?

19:19.526 --> 19:22.829
All you had to do
was watch the bags!

19:22.862 --> 19:24.964
All I wanted was
some Southern hospitality,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.934
but all I got was
Northern hostility.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.304
Oh, y'all not hungry, right?

19:31.338 --> 19:32.905
Yes, we are.
ALL:
Yeah!

19:32.939 --> 19:34.741
Y'all hungry for this?!

19:36.008 --> 19:38.778
Louis, this food
is incredible.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.514
Well, I figured that since
we couldn't go down South,

19:41.548 --> 19:42.882
I'd make us
a good Southern meal.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.883
RACHELLE:
Nice.

19:43.916 --> 19:44.917
Yeah, if Chris wasn't

19:44.951 --> 19:46.986
so stupid, we could have gone.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.987
Thanks, Chris.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.522
Well, what
are we gonna do

19:49.556 --> 19:50.390
with all that money we won?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.225
We?

19:52.259 --> 19:54.294
Did you hear your daddy

19:54.327 --> 19:56.963
We are gonna send Uncle Morris
some flowers

19:56.996 --> 19:57.964
and the rest of that money

19:57.997 --> 20:00.967
is going back
into my emergency fund. "We."

20:02.602 --> 20:03.803
Mm-hmm!

20:03.836 --> 20:07.407
Oh, my goodness.
Mm-mm-mm, goodness.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.875
Southern pecan pie.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.243
You know it's
my favorite, right?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.478
Want a piece?
All right now.
Yeah.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.945
You can have a piece.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.848
All you got to do
is pick out the jack.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.755
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.792
