[theme music]

00:08.042 --> 00:09.177
I have had it, Roseanne.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.479
I can't keep hiding
David at my house.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.481
I mean, it's been like a week.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.716
I can't take care
of him anymore.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.218
Luckily, those
maternal instincts are

00:17.251 --> 00:18.586
kicking in in the nick of time.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.457
Have you told Dan
about David yet?

00:23.491 --> 00:24.558
Yes.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.926
Really?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.595
And what'd he say?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.097
Oh, oh, you mean the truth?

00:29.130 --> 00:31.465
No.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.734
It's starting to get
very uncomfortable.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.737
Last night, he thought
I tried to seduce him.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.309
Well, it was kind of funny.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.711
I just gave him a hug because
he said something sweet,

00:43.744 --> 00:45.613
and boom, now he
thinks I want him.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.115
That is so funny.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.649
I know.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.618
I mean, who'd want to go to
bed with some big old fat lady?

00:56.090 --> 00:58.526
I gotta go talk to Mark.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.494
Anyway, David's
acting really weird now.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.330
He hasn't showered in
three days because he's

01:02.363 --> 01:05.032
afraid I'll walk in on him.

01:05.065 --> 01:05.933
Hello.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.869
Well, hello, Darlene.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.872
Gosh, it's just so
wonderful to have you home,

01:11.905 --> 01:13.774
especially when you're in
really, really big trouble.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.313
I'm home.
Now what?

01:19.347 --> 01:20.481
Oh, gee, let's see.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.684
It has been so long
since I punished you,

01:23.717 --> 01:27.087
I wonder if I even remember how.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.989
You're grounded.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.358
There, yeah.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.561
It's just like riding a bike.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.562
You can't ground me.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.929
I don't even live here anymore.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.798
The only reason I came home
is because you said that we

01:37.831 --> 01:39.267
could talk to Dad about David.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.801
You know, he's like
really unhappy.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.336
David is just fine.
Don't worry about him.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.737
He's, just a little
shook because aunt

01:43.771 --> 01:47.441
Jackie put the moves on him.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.109
I did not.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.245
Who'd want to sleep with
some big old fat lady?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.487
Well, David's gotta
come back here.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.088
If you won't talk to Dad,
I'll go do it myself.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.157
Oh, I don't think this would
be the right time with the mood

02:03.191 --> 02:04.925
your dad's in, Darlene.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.594
Let's face it.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.928
You need my help.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.366
Pff.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.735
Oh, you are twisted.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.174
Do you think I take joy
in punishing my children?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.042
Yes, I do.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.111
See, Jackie, you must
always let the child

02:24.144 --> 02:27.114
know why they're being punished.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.251
Damn snowplow blocked
the driveway again!

02:30.284 --> 02:31.352
Oh God.

- Hi, Dad.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.900
Hey, sport.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.336
Great to see you.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.071
Yeah, you too.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.740
What do you say you
and me go get a sundae?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.775
Really?

02:54.808 --> 02:55.676
Oh, OK.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.810
Great.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.745
Here you go.

03:03.317 --> 03:06.254
Uh, Dan.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.155
So what the hell were
you doing right there?

03:08.188 --> 03:11.459
Don't you know what's been going
on for the last three months?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.926
Well, we don't get
to see her very often.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.428
She's still one of our kids.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.764
I know that, but you are
being really nice to her

03:16.797 --> 03:19.467
like she's a total stranger.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.201
She's never gonna come home
if every time she does,

03:21.235 --> 03:23.036
it's miserable.
- Why not?

03:23.070 --> 03:24.438
I do.

OK, I'll be there
in a sec, daddy.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.801
We went sledding.

that you're home.

Now you can do the dishes.

04:31.038 --> 04:31.905
Oh, wait.

04:31.939 --> 04:36.209
I think there's even a few more.

04:36.243 --> 04:39.947
Dad, Mom wants me
to do the dishes.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.349
Don't be silly.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.350
Come watch the game.

Hey, you.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.531
What?

04:57.565 --> 05:00.133
What is it?
- Nothing.

05:00.167 --> 05:04.104
It's just, have you
been working out lately?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.110
Nah.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.082
Well, not in a program.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.089
Well, you're looking
pretty buff there, Dad.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.323
Ah, quit it.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.666
So how's life?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.301
Well, school's OK.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.170
Good.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.807
You know, I'm kind of
lonely since David left.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.109
I mean, which is really weird
because I hated having him

05:42.142 --> 05:44.545
there.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.213
Too bad.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.515
I talk to him.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.117
I mean in Michigan.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.485
He's not too happy.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
He's really sorry.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.325
You know, we're both really
sorry that we lied to you.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.860
Well, it's over.
It's time to move on.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.264
Dad, can David move
back in the house?

06:04.297 --> 06:05.566
No.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.435
But Dad, you can't just
let him live with his mom.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.335
I said no, Darlene.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.903
The boy has done enough damage.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.805
And I don't care how
horrible his mother is.

He's not an infant.

I'm sorry, what was that?

06:36.029 --> 06:38.632
I didn't quite hear
what you just said.

06:42.603 --> 06:46.039
Um, I'm a horrible
ungrateful daughter.

06:46.073 --> 06:50.043
You're all-powerful
and all-knowing.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.046
And I'm nothing but
dirt at your feet.

Please, oh please,
have mercy on me.

What are you doing?

Oh, I was just getting
my jacket because,

07:17.070 --> 07:20.007
um, the basement's cold.

07:20.040 --> 07:20.941
You don't have to do that.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.810
I'll just turn the heat up.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.378
Oh, right of course.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.081
Yeah, I keep it down because
it enhances the youthfulness

07:28.115 --> 07:30.551
of one's complexion.

07:30.584 --> 07:34.154
Plus it keeps my beer cold.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.055
All right, well, thanks.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.490
And I guess I'll turn in.

07:36.524 --> 07:40.127
Listen, Darlene, I'm sorry
I yelled at you earlier.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.697
I know the whole thing with
David wasn't your fault.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.165
Yeah, OK.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.235
As far as I'm concerned,
the whole matter is behind us.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.038
It's as if the whole
thing never existed.

07:51.071 --> 07:51.972
Yeah, right.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.006
Tell that to my baby.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.698
I've been waiting in
the park for hours.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.299
Get your coat and
meet me out front.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.534
I can't get past my dad.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.902
There's an "F
Troop" marathon on.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.607
Well, I can't come in
because your mom said

08:26.640 --> 08:28.408
I wasn't allowed in the house.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.509
Oh, that's right.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.911
We're not supposed to
be speaking either.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.713
See ya.
- Alright, alright.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.614
I'll come in.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.959
Hey.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.962
Hey.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.965
Things are a mess, huh?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.234
Well, you give a decorator
complete control, and.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.441
I meant us.

Yeah, I know.

I miss this room.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.822
I miss you.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.789
I still love you, Darlene.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.492
Yeah, me too.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.999
So what do we do?

09:26.033 --> 09:26.834
I don't know.

09:37.845 --> 09:38.712
Hey, Darlene.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.081
I brought you an extra--

09:41.114 --> 09:42.549
Mr. Conner, I'm sorry.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.917
Shut up.
Shut up!

09:43.951 --> 09:44.852
Dad!

09:44.885 --> 09:46.419
What's the matter
with you, boy?

09:46.453 --> 09:47.788
Can't keep your pants on?

09:47.821 --> 09:48.722
Dad, just stop it!

09:48.756 --> 09:49.623
I made him--

09:49.657 --> 09:50.824
I'm not talking
to you, Darlene!

09:50.858 --> 09:52.225
Yeah, I can fight
my own battles.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.966
David, just go
back to Jackie's.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.834
- Alright.
- Jackie's?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.469
I thought he was
staying with his mother.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.572
Later, Mrs. Conner.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.874
What the hell's going on?

10:06.907 --> 10:09.009
Yeah, what the
hell is going on?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.610
You told me you sent David away.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.545
This whole time, he's been
staying at your sister's.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.849
Uh, well, yeah, I
did send him away,

10:15.883 --> 10:21.588
but you know, then Jackie
got involved, and uh--

10:21.621 --> 10:23.657
Dan, didn't we say we would
never raise our voices

10:23.691 --> 10:24.491
in front of the kids?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.864
After everything
that boy's done,

10:30.898 --> 10:31.965
you've been helping him out?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.533
No, I haven't been
helping him out.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.434
I don't know.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.335
I don't know.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
I'm sorry Dan, I don't know.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.741
I'm, I'm just soft.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.075
Oh, I can't handle this.

10:42.109 --> 10:42.976
I'm out of here.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.144
No, you're not going anyplace.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.379
You're grounded.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.447
OK, wait a minute.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.349
Now, I'm grounded
for lying to you guys

10:49.382 --> 10:51.118
about living with David, right?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.452
Right.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.388
Just like you lied to Dad
and said that you didn't know

10:55.422 --> 10:57.357
that I was living with him in
Chicago, even though you did,

10:57.390 --> 10:59.426
right?
- Excuse me?

10:59.459 --> 11:00.393
Oh, oh.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.529
You are in so much trouble now.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.737
Ratting out your own mother!

11:09.770 --> 11:13.306
There's just nothing
lower than that.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
I mean, am I right, Dan?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.044
Is that, like-- ratting
out your mom, that's gotta

11:17.077 --> 11:19.780
be the worst, right?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.615
I'm going to Jackie's.

11:22.649 --> 11:26.987
What are we going
to do with her?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.555
You mean you knew
the whole time?

11:28.588 --> 11:29.689
No!

11:29.723 --> 11:31.458
I didn't-- no, I didn't
know the whole time, no.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.592
No.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.029
Of course I-- you know,
just for like, OK, the,

11:36.063 --> 11:38.565
you know, like the
last couple of days.

11:38.598 --> 11:42.435
When I went up there, you know,
uh, and I dragged David home

11:42.469 --> 11:43.871
and I put an end to
it all by myself,

11:43.904 --> 11:44.972
do you know what I mean.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.706
I handled it all by
myself, Dan, because I

11:46.740 --> 11:48.608
just didn't want to get you
upset, you know what I mean?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.944
I took all this stress
on myself and uh,

11:50.978 --> 11:53.613
of course now that
you're on board,

11:53.646 --> 11:55.682
I'm feeling a lot
of relief, Dan.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.516
Dan?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.564
Oh, well.

12:11.598 --> 12:15.035
Well, Isn't this nice?

12:15.068 --> 12:19.172
What a great aunt you are,
making him just so comfortable.

12:19.206 --> 12:23.076
Why don't you tack up the
bathroom mirror on the ceiling?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.712
Because, Mom, then when
we do it in the bathroom,

12:25.745 --> 12:26.679
we won't be able to watch.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.318
Darlene, you're not helping.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.954
Darlene, you take your
butt home right now.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.088
I'm not going
back to that house

12:35.122 --> 12:36.323
just so you can torture me.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.625
Wrong, that is exactly
why you're going back there.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.527
You're in big trouble, and
your punishment is not going

12:40.560 --> 12:42.329
to be sex with your boyfriend.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.731
Well, obviously, you've never
had sex with my boyfriend.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.976
You know, it's a
good thing I'm not

12:56.009 --> 12:57.277
living with my abusive mother.

13:00.981 --> 13:01.949
Well, that's better.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.616
Now it's just us three girls.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.224
I will be in the
kitchen, making sure

13:11.258 --> 13:12.692
that David doesn't disturb us.

13:15.562 --> 13:19.399
Mom, I don't need
you to punish me.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.934
Yes, you do.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.170
I'm your mother, and
it's my job to correct

13:23.203 --> 13:24.771
you when you make a mistake.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.874
But I know living with
David was a mistake.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.275
It was miserable.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.511
No punishment you could give me
could make me feel any worse.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.214
Ah, so it'll be a challenge.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.382
You don't get it.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.917
I learned my lesson.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.619
David and I were not
ready to live together.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.022
You know, I know that now,
and I learned it on my own.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.756
Wasn't that just great?

13:43.790 --> 13:45.893
I'm so proud of you, Darlene.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.929
And lesson number two is what?

13:48.962 --> 13:51.264
Uh, always share?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.835
No.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.006
It's you don't treat
your mother like crap.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.175
You know, you lied to me
constantly for three months.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.643
OK, it's gonna
take a lot of work

14:03.676 --> 14:05.645
before you and me
are square again.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.546
Alright, fine.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.480
I'll do the dishes.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.381
I'll clean the house.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.417
I'll do the whole alphabet.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.153
But I'm not going home
while Dad is acting

14:13.186 --> 14:14.521
like a psychopathic lunatic.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.858
Oh, Darlene.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.393
Your father is a reasonable man.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.595
You just give him enough
time and he'll get over it.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.605
So, uh, you want to watch
a movie on TV or something?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.474
I gotta kill a couple
hours before I can go back.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.984
Hey, Dan, ready to go?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.585
Just a minute.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.255
Oh, looks like somebody's
been riding the couch.

14:48.288 --> 14:53.060
Hey, this was my choice,
so it's not embarrassing.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.928
Dan, this is between
you and Roseanne, OK.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.030
I don't want to get involved.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.266
Hey, pal, you're
already involved.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.435
You got her sister
pregnant, and if I was you,

15:02.469 --> 15:03.903
I'd sue for custody now.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.672
Because by the time
the kid's 17 you won't

15:05.705 --> 15:07.240
have any claim on them at all.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.675
A custody suit?

15:08.708 --> 15:09.642
Damn women.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.611
Who the hell do
they think they are?

15:11.644 --> 15:15.015
We are sugar and spice
and everything nice.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.016
So bite me.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.888
Hey, Roseanne.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.590
Why, hello, Fred.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.426
I think I shall be the one
taking Dan to work today.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.995
I think Fred should.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.930
Dan, I'm sorry, but I got
to agree with Roseanne here.

15:30.964 --> 15:34.201
(WHISPERING) With you, buddy.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.137
On second thought,
I just might

15:37.170 --> 15:38.438
like to walk to work today.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.174
Oh, you don't even
like to walk to the car.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.609
Do you have any idea
how this discussion

15:42.642 --> 15:43.510
is supposed to begin?

15:43.543 --> 15:44.544
You're supposed to apologize.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.046
You're the one who lied to me.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.348
Well, it's not like
I feel good about it.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.816
I mean, you found out.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.985
The whole thing would have
never happened if you hadn't

15:52.019 --> 15:53.453
brought David into this house.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.554
What the hell were you thinking?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.023
Well, I wanted
him to live here.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.025
I still want him to live here.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.259
Why?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.561
Well, because maybe I still
think he's a good kid.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.130
Gee, you know.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.497
He's handy to have
around the house.

16:04.531 --> 16:08.635
You never know if I'm gonna
need something on a low shelf.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.536
What is with you?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.703
Why are you taking David's side?

16:10.737 --> 16:11.904
Well, somebody has to.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.707
God, Dan, you're putting
the whole thing in Chicago

16:14.741 --> 16:15.842
on David.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.111
Well, Darlene was
there too, you know.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.580
It's not like David forced
her to hide him out there.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.983
All I know is before
David came along, Darlene

16:24.017 --> 16:26.219
was not the kind of
kid who would move

16:26.253 --> 16:27.987
in with her teenage boyfriend.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.791
Before David came
around, Darlene was 12.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.127
You know what I mean.
He's a teenage boy.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.064
They can be very persuasive.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.532
Have you met Darlene at all?

16:39.566 --> 16:42.102
Have you seen the control
she has over David?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.703
I mean, David isn't
even his real name.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.073
She just made that up.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.141
Roseanne, you've been
saying it for years.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.942
I'm finally gonna
agree with you.

16:49.976 --> 16:53.446
Men are pigs.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.648
I mean, you were every bit
as bullheaded as Darlene was,

16:55.682 --> 16:57.284
and I managed to persuade you.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.086
Right.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.454
You remember our second date?

17:01.488 --> 17:04.424
You were upset because you had
this big fight with your mom.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.193
I wasn't thinking
about your feelings.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.261
I was thinking you were
ripe for the picking.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.664
Show a little charm, pour a
few drinks down her, boom,

17:11.698 --> 17:13.500
we're at the Blue Rooster motel!

17:13.533 --> 17:16.603
Cock a doodle do.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.638
My mom was in Indiana.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.273
There was no fight.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.075
I just set the whole
thing up so that you

17:22.109 --> 17:25.011
would be able to take advantage
of me in my time of need.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.623
So you've been lying
to me from the beginning.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.161
Face it, Dan.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.062
I seduced you.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.865
And Darlene may very well
have seduced David, OK?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.667
So you can't keep blaming
David for this whole thing.

17:47.700 --> 17:53.373
Darlene had sex because
she wanted to have sex.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.008
I gotta go to work.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.544
The fact that I had my
nightgown in my purse

17:57.577 --> 17:58.478
should have tipped you out.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.788
Hey, it's me.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.689
Hi.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.492
I didn't hear your car.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.426
Rode DJ's bike.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.097
May have to take it
to the shop tomorrow.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.302
Well, what can I do for you?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.174
No, no.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.175
I shouldn't have to leave.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.008
This is my house.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.282
And since it's my house I should
offer you some coffee, which

18:35.315 --> 18:36.983
I will make in the kitchen.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.586
Just still in my house,
so I'm not really leaving.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.194
Mom send you to get me?

18:47.227 --> 18:49.896
I didn't come to get you.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.064
Came to get David?

18:52.098 --> 18:52.965
Really?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.667
Yeah.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.002
Wait, so you're
like cool with this?

18:56.035 --> 18:59.639
No, I just don't blame
David for everything anymore.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.674
Well, Dad, you don't exactly
have the right to be mad at me

19:01.708 --> 19:02.742
for having sex.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.910
I mean, did you expect
me to be a virgin

19:03.943 --> 19:05.044
for the rest of my life?

19:05.077 --> 19:08.248
No, I expected you
to be a nice kid.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.516
But Dad, I'm not
even a kid anymore.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.351
I know that.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.052
I don't like it, but I know it.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.921
I also know you lied
to me and your mother

19:14.954 --> 19:16.889
for the last three months.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.625
Well, I had to or you
guys would have freaked out.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.627
I mean, I had a good reason
for everything that I did.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.528
That's great.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.297
You had your reasons.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.032
I just don't know if
things between me and you

19:26.065 --> 19:27.800
are ever gonna be
the same again.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.269
Well, why not?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.404
I mean Becky ran off
and eloped with Mark.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.273
I mean, you let
her off the hook.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.574
Maybe I expected
more out of you.

19:41.047 --> 19:41.848
Hey, David.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.694
OK, yeah.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.528
Hi.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.335
You want to come home with me?

20:02.369 --> 20:04.437
For what?

20:04.471 --> 20:05.572
It's OK, David.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.908
He's offering to take you back.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.143
Really?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.946
Thank you, Mr. Conner.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.814
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

20:20.587 --> 20:26.225
David, I'm glad you're
coming back, but no more lying.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.763
Look.

20:30.797 --> 20:31.864
Mr Conner.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.533
There's something I
want to say to you.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.304
There's something
that you should know.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.440
I really love your
daughter, and you should

20:40.473 --> 20:45.978
realize that when she and I--

20:46.012 --> 20:51.384
when we-- when we're
having our tenderness--

20:51.418 --> 20:52.285
David, stop.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.753
Thank you.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.656
[music playing]

21:01.628 --> 21:05.097
Hey, Darlene, I
got you an extra.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.033
Mr. Conner, I'm sorry.

21:07.066 --> 21:07.934
Shut up.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.068
Just shut up! - Dad!

21:09.101 --> 21:10.603
What's the matter
with you, boy?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.504
Huh?

21:11.538 --> 21:13.640
Can't you keep your pants on?

21:13.673 --> 21:14.541
Dad I made him come in!

21:17.577 --> 21:19.312
Darlene, I'm not
talking to you.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.713
[laughter]

21:20.747 --> 21:22.148
I can fight my own battles.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.783
David, just go
back to Jackie's.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.717
- All right.
- Jackie's?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.718
[door thumping]

21:25.752 --> 21:28.355
I thought he was
staying with his mom.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.757
[laughter]

21:30.790 --> 21:31.658
Sorry.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.092
I'll get you David.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.194
That method acting
will get you in trouble.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.095
Yeah.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.164
[music playing]
