Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

00:10.710 --> 00:13.270
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

00:13.346 --> 00:18.181
- This is John Morris.
- Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

00:18.251 --> 00:21.084
- Welcome to the unrated...
- Uncircumcised...

00:21.154 --> 00:22.451
...edition of...

00:22.522 --> 00:24.422
<i>...Sex Drive.</i>
<i>- Sex Drive.</i>

00:24.491 --> 00:27.007
How many times has
this happened to you?

00:27.160 --> 00:31.394
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

00:31.464 --> 00:35.594
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

00:35.668 --> 00:37.966
and maybe an additional tit or two.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.097
- What a jip.
- And how...

00:40.173 --> 00:41.504
Not this time.

00:41.574 --> 00:45.738
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

00:45.812 --> 00:47.143
the viewer,

00:48.214 --> 00:52.173
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.153
- We promise...
- Plus, we promise more tits.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.485
Bare tits like these.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.056
These tits are good.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.031
Plus, more cock, like this.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.066
That's good cock, John.

01:08.501 --> 01:12.801
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

01:12.872 --> 01:17.206
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

01:17.277 --> 01:20.041
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

01:20.113 --> 01:21.102
- the viewer.
- The viewer.

01:21.347 --> 01:25.875
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

01:25.952 --> 01:28.420
do not watch this version first.

01:28.488 --> 01:32.219
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.384
Why?

01:33.460 --> 01:38.022
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

01:45.138 --> 01:49.097
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.143
Mine's one my... It's on my back.

01:51.211 --> 01:55.011
But actually I have a town car outside
if you wanna go see...

02:02.122 --> 02:04.317
All right.
Why don't you do one more?

02:25.078 --> 02:28.070
We open up against Michigan
in two weeks.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.949
Coach's got me hitting the bench
pretty hard.

02:37.123 --> 02:40.251
Shit. How much is a lot?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.088
One... No, two.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.935
I'm putting up three hundy.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.873
Well, let's see, Tasty.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.313
Wow!

03:10.823 --> 03:11.812
Um...

03:13.793 --> 03:16.762
Wow, you're really pretty. I've never seen...

03:17.130 --> 03:18.324
No, stop it, stop it.

03:18.398 --> 03:22.164
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.867
<i>Don't be a pussy.</i>
<i>Tell her she's an ugly skank.</i>

03:29.943 --> 03:31.501
Yeah.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.806
Not bad.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.407
I've seen better.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.378
Yeah, whatever.

03:43.489 --> 03:48.051
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I gotta bounce.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.980
Miss Tasty? How did you get here?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.178
Shh!

05:36.936 --> 05:39.370
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

05:39.439 --> 05:41.498
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.701
- Okay, I'll be right down.
- No. Now, Clay Aiken.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.767
- All right.
- No, now, homo.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.870
- Just give me a minute.
- No, no, no, no. Now, sissy.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.711
- Just...
- No, now, chode-stroker.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.374
Now, ball bag.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.287
Hey...

06:01.494 --> 06:03.792
- Ow! Cut it out.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.990
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

06:06.399 --> 06:10.233
Hey, Big D, sorry. Go back to sleep.
You're golden.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.033
- You, get your ass up.
- Give me a minute.

06:13.272 --> 06:14.796
What're you doing under there, huh?

06:14.874 --> 06:18.310
What're you doing?
You're firing off your skin pistol?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.372
Come on, get up. What are you hiding?

06:20.446 --> 06:22.437
You got a big fattie under there, don't you?

06:22.515 --> 06:26.747
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
What the F?

06:27.520 --> 06:31.456
Your little brother's sleeping
not ten feet away. Jesus Christ!

06:31.791 --> 06:33.224
Good. My boys are all here.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.260
- Dad, Ian's free...
- Can it, Rex.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.764
Your pop's got a bombshell to drop,
so ears open.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.800
Last night,
your old man popped the question.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.663
Show them, Karen.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.034
I'm so happy.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.879
Hey, way to go!

06:53.946 --> 06:57.404
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

06:57.483 --> 06:58.472
Um...

06:59.018 --> 07:03.751
- Yeah, Ian, come on. You're being rude.
- Can we do that later?

07:03.823 --> 07:07.281
- Damn it, Ian, get up...
- No, no, honey. It's okay.

07:07.960 --> 07:12.260
We have to give him time
to get used to the idea.

07:14.634 --> 07:15.623
Karen?
- Are you okay?

07:15.701 --> 07:17.760
Karen? Karen, honey?
- You okay?

07:17.837 --> 07:18.826
Sweetheart?

07:19.405 --> 07:21.270
What smells like jizz?

07:26.579 --> 07:29.241
Let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!

07:39.258 --> 07:42.557
Come on, get in. Get in!

07:50.870 --> 07:52.167
You suck!

07:54.173 --> 07:57.336
Okay, seriously.
Quit being such a fag and get in.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.839
<i> Never go down</i>
<i>So let's get it up</i>

08:08.621 --> 08:12.580
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.857
- You queer?
- What?

08:14.927 --> 08:17.395
- God damn it! I knew it!
- I didn't say anything.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.761
Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

08:19.832 --> 08:23.268
you just deny it, straight off.
No pause, no farting around.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.735
Rex, I'm not gay.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.795
- Dad thinks you're gay.
- What?

08:26.873 --> 08:30.001
- You're breaking the old man's heart.
- No, I'm not. I told him I'm not.

08:30.076 --> 08:33.203
Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.975
That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.015
I don't think that's really how it happens.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.484
Is that not how it happens?
So tell me how it happens, expert.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.986
Fucking cock expert. Cockspert.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.046
Hey, what do you like better,
the shaft or the balls?

08:45.157 --> 08:48.217
- That's gross.
- You like them both, don't you?

08:48.394 --> 08:52.831
It's like, sometimes like, Tuesdays you want
the big, old fucking shiny-ass cock,

08:52.899 --> 08:56.300
and Wednesdays and Thursdays
you're on to the balls.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.564
- I don't know why you're talking about it.
- You can't choose, can you?

08:58.638 --> 09:01.539
That's a tough one.
You love it and you're obsessed with it.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.041
No, you are. You keep talking about it.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.873
Why're you smiling at me? I'm serious.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.880
Don't fucking smile at me. You know
I'll knock you out of this goddamn earth.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.813
What does it taste like?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.249
Like, right when you take your mouth off
and it's like kind of

09:13.319 --> 09:16.550
like you can almost see your reflection
in that fucking cock.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.783
Smack you in the face with it a little bit.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.985
- You don't like that?
- I don't eat...

09:21.060 --> 09:27.966
Just cut. Just like, shiny fucking stiff,
hot vascular mushroom head.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.228
Yeah, yeah.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.566
Look, every guy's got a fantasy
about another guy,

09:31.637 --> 09:35.368
but you got to bury that shit way down.
This is America, God damn it.

09:35.441 --> 09:39.434
There is...
There is a girl that I've been kind of...

09:39.512 --> 09:42.413
All right, I'm listening.
Where'd you meet her?

09:42.481 --> 09:44.039
On the... Online.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.209
What? For fuck's sake, Ian,
don't you watch <i>Dateline?</i>

09:49.322 --> 09:53.691
She's probably a guy. Some fat old dude
who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.320
But you'd love that, wouldn't you?
'Cause you're a homo.

10:11.377 --> 10:15.575
Hey, Ian. Try not to come home any gayer
than you are now.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.885
Seriously, though. You're a fag.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.979
Hey, don't look at me like that.
I'll punch you in the goddamn throat.

10:33.032 --> 10:37.128
<i> Hey</i>

10:37.737 --> 10:41.195
<i>What's your favorite song?</i>

10:41.273 --> 10:44.106
<i>Maybe we could hum along</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:51.682
<i>Well, I think you're smart,</i>
<i>you sweet thing</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:57.585
<i>Tell me your name,</i>
<i>I'm dying here</i>

11:03.195 --> 11:06.653
<i>Got you where I want you</i>

11:07.833 --> 11:09.323
<i>Yeah</i>

11:17.243 --> 11:23.648
- Hey, Becca. How are you?
- I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.879
Hey, Becca.
Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

11:27.953 --> 11:31.787
- Ron and Ian want the <i>four-one-uno.</i>
- Whatever. You guys are gross.

11:31.857 --> 11:36.419
- I'm not gross. I didn't say anything.
- Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?

11:38.998 --> 11:42.297
- No, Becca, I did it yesterday.
- Please, Ian.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.299
I love you so much.

11:47.506 --> 11:52.068
Hello. This is a coupon for six free...
No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.772
- Six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen.
- Thanks.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.439
You're welcome. Sorry.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.341
Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

12:00.419 --> 12:04.480
- It's just past the movie theater.
- Thanks, man.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.395
Yeah, real funny.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.325
Free donuts, free coupons.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.901
Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

12:30.983 --> 12:34.441
Well, you look nice.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.348
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

12:37.423 --> 12:38.583
before my wedding.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.125
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.356
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.824
Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.959
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

12:50.035 --> 12:53.527
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.404
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.739
I am so sorry. I was just...

13:02.014 --> 13:06.610
Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

13:12.858 --> 13:18.262
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.666
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

13:21.734 --> 13:23.668
but your whole trying too hard thing,

13:23.736 --> 13:26.398
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.804
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

13:28.874 --> 13:33.777
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.937
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

13:36.015 --> 13:39.883
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

13:39.952 --> 13:44.480
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

13:46.091 --> 13:49.822
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.193
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

13:52.264 --> 13:55.165
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

13:55.234 --> 13:58.067
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

13:58.137 --> 14:01.129
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

14:01.207 --> 14:04.904
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.810
Nice. Always classy.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.646
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

14:15.321 --> 14:19.189
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.696
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!

14:31.103 --> 14:35.096
- Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
- I don't know.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.574
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

14:37.643 --> 14:40.134
- Like a little tree trunk.
- Thank you.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.145
Oh, my God.

14:46.118 --> 14:50.077
- Whoa. You look pretty.
- God, shut up, Ian!

14:50.155 --> 14:54.057
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.458
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

14:56.528 --> 15:00.020
- Yeah, Ian.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.125
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

15:03.202 --> 15:07.901
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.441
That's what you say about everyone.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.500
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.012
- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

15:15.080 --> 15:18.413
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.678
Ian, do not listen to him.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.448
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.148
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.453
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.925
- Everybody wants...
- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

15:28.994 --> 15:32.327
Do you get it? 'Cause I mean, it feels like
I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.

15:32.398 --> 15:36.391
- That shit does not work.
- It works on you.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.231
No, it doesn't.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.308
Felicia!

15:44.576 --> 15:48.342
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.281
- Pretty cousin?
- Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.478
- She's still super hot.
- Fuck you, too. See you.

15:55.521 --> 15:56.613
So what happened with Becca?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.281
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

15:58.357 --> 16:02.817
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.730
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

16:05.798 --> 16:08.995
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.036
- And I get it, but I just...
- Thanks.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.934
I don't think I could do that for real.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.098
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.940
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.104
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.045
You think they care
what women think about them?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.048
They could give a fuck.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.381
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

16:28.454 --> 16:31.821
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.289
- Would you like to help?
- Not really.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.826
- We don't have any money.
- No jobs.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.129
You wanna party?

16:38.197 --> 16:40.358
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.764
- When are you done?
- Yeah, what are you doing after?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.393
I have a church thing tonight.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.404
- Kick ass, we'll come.
- Yeah, where is it?

16:46.472 --> 16:48.497
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.566
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.577
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.272
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.048
- Do you wear thong underpants?
- Do you want us to take our shirts off?

16:58.117 --> 17:00.449
- What color bra are you wearing?
- Is your mom hot, too?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.111
Are you into me?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.916
- Where do you live?
- What color car do you have?

17:03.989 --> 17:05.650
- Where do you live?
- What's your address?

17:05.758 --> 17:07.419
- Do you want us to come over?
- Do you like pizza?

17:07.492 --> 17:09.393
We've been to a motel.

17:13.265 --> 17:17.133
- Fuck off, donut.
- Rex, it's me.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.304
What the fuck is this all about?

17:20.372 --> 17:24.273
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

17:24.343 --> 17:28.244
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.750
You suck.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.188
Becca? Hey.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.628
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

17:44.496 --> 17:49.661
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

17:49.735 --> 17:52.397
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.907
- So...
- Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

17:55.974 --> 17:59.774
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

17:59.845 --> 18:03.576
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

18:03.649 --> 18:04.877
Now, the party, it doesn't start

18:04.950 --> 18:08.784
- for a few hours.
- Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.591
- Dylan?
- Yeah. Is he here?

18:13.659 --> 18:16.059
- My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
- Yeah.

18:16.128 --> 18:21.088
Nice underpants, Ian.
- Snap! Dang, that was funny.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.157
You know he's 14, right?

18:41.720 --> 18:45.315
Laura, Cindy, this shit is totally gratuitous.
I love it.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.463
- Hey, congrats. Good to see you.
- Hey.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.237
Is this the plan?

19:13.685 --> 19:17.951
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.992
- Are you smoking cigars now?
- Yes.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.324
- Hey, Lance. Tight party.
- Okay, rude.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.227
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.233
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

19:29.301 --> 19:30.632
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.670
- Don't apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.433
Don't apologize to me.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.768
Hey, I'm gonna go see
who Felicia's talking to.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.076
No, dude, forget Felicia, okay?

19:43.148 --> 19:45.173
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit,

19:45.250 --> 19:47.616
but tonight's about getting that dick
a little daylight.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.711
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart,
where you going?

19:49.788 --> 19:52.256
Come here, we're not done. Get in here.

19:52.324 --> 19:56.158
- You know my boy Ian?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

19:56.228 --> 20:00.130
- You used to be on my paper route.
- Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

20:00.199 --> 20:06.627
Fucking A your mom likes Ian. Look at him.
He's a big, bright crimson king. Right?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.900
You know what else?

20:08.974 --> 20:11.101
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.110
I'm so sorry.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.411
Don't let that deter you from fucking him.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.353
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked.
I got into the University of Wisconsin,

20:27.426 --> 20:29.656
and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine,
'cause that's where...

20:29.728 --> 20:32.162
- Are you gonna go to college?
- University of Boulder.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.926
It's a great party school.

20:33.999 --> 20:39.369
You know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.372
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

20:41.440 --> 20:47.106
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

20:49.982 --> 20:51.244
Planets.

20:51.850 --> 20:55.342
Wow! A little tip action there.
That's really suggestive.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.651
I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

20:58.757 --> 21:01.988
You can just stick with my finger
if you want 'cause this feels great, so...

21:03.362 --> 21:08.425
You're really good at that.
That's really wet. Two...

21:11.436 --> 21:13.904
Ian! Dude!
- I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?

21:13.972 --> 21:15.963
Hello. Hello?

21:16.041 --> 21:19.408
- Hey!
- Hey! What up?

21:19.478 --> 21:23.244
- What are you doing in there, man?
- What're you doing out here, man?

21:23.315 --> 21:26.148
- I asked you first.
- Nothing.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.984
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

21:30.055 --> 21:34.992
- I thought you had, like, a girl in there.
- Yeah, right. I wish.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.587
So, okay.
So, are your parents, like, still going

21:38.664 --> 21:40.723
to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?

21:40.832 --> 21:42.459
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They all take off in the morning.

21:42.534 --> 21:43.796
Okay. Awesome.

21:43.869 --> 21:48.897
'Cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts,
so, I don't know,

21:48.974 --> 21:52.137
you think, like, maybe I could hang
at your place this weekend?

21:52.244 --> 21:54.906
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something.
It'll be fun.

21:54.980 --> 22:01.283
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
Hey, I have a secret.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.555
- Okay.
- But it's like a girl secret, so...

22:05.624 --> 22:10.357
- Can you handle it? Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

22:10.462 --> 22:13.226
Hey, Dibits, fuck off.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.901
Okay, so I... Oh my God, this is so lame.

22:18.970 --> 22:23.430
- Look at you acting like such a girl.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.

22:25.277 --> 22:29.714
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.

22:30.315 --> 22:32.909
Yeah? Well, who is it?

22:32.984 --> 22:35.782
Come on, you know me better than anyone.
I bet you know who it is.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.412
Come on, guess.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.447
Um...

22:41.259 --> 22:42.817
I think I know.

22:51.103 --> 22:56.905
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you.
You're so easy. You're so easy!

23:00.912 --> 23:04.006
- You're my best friend.
- I know, and you're my best friend.

23:04.082 --> 23:08.041
That's why it's funny that we would kiss,
because we wouldn't.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.283
So who is it? Who's the lucky <i>caballero?</i>

23:14.826 --> 23:17.056
Um... Nobody.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.963
- Nobody?
- I... I was kidding, too.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.026
- That is funny.
- It's hilarious.

23:24.102 --> 23:26.468
- That is so funny.
- That is so funny.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.002
Oh! I...

23:29.074 --> 23:30.063
- You got...
- Yeah.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.667
- All right. So...
- Hey!

23:32.744 --> 23:34.109
Okay.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.178
Harsh.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.357
Well, come on, Ian.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.762
You know what? I'm good. I'm just gonna...

23:57.836 --> 24:00.669
Ian, come on, baby. Don't be shy.

24:00.739 --> 24:04.766
No, thanks. It looks like
you got your hands full there, so...

24:04.843 --> 24:07.038
Sure you don't want to
get in on this, bro?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.171
No, thanks, man.

24:09.247 --> 24:12.648
It looks like you fellows
got it all under control.

24:12.717 --> 24:16.710
So I'm just gonna skedaddle.
You all take care now.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.346
Lindsay, say hi to your mom.

24:19.524 --> 24:21.014
All right. See you later, buddy.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.961
Ian. Dude, where you going?

24:33.205 --> 24:34.297
Shit.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.705
Hey, Goldie, scoot over.

24:51.456 --> 24:54.653
- Hey, babe, you wanna party?
- I'm at a party.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.853
You should pee on us.

24:56.928 --> 24:57.986
Why don't you take a picture, Ian?

24:58.063 --> 25:00.793
Yeah, and post it on
Totalfuckingawesomeness. com.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.891
Backslash-we-rule!

25:02.968 --> 25:04.128
Where'd you come up with that?

25:04.202 --> 25:09.299
- Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
- You just did.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.166
- Can I ask you another question?
- You just did again.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.439
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

25:14.513 --> 25:17.778
Nice hair. It'll look even better in my crotch.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.752
- Dude, where you going?
- Come on.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.824
What's going on?
Something troubling you? Be a buddy.

25:26.892 --> 25:31.989
- I'm... All right, all right.
- You got to get over the monkey.

25:32.063 --> 25:36.227
Where do you guys get the confidence to,
like, hit on every girl you see?

25:36.301 --> 25:40.135
- 'Cause we're the shit.
- Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.609
- So where's Felicia?
- Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.

25:47.579 --> 25:50.946
- She's in...
- Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?

25:51.783 --> 25:53.375
We're just friends.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.214
- I'm uncircumcised.
- Yeah.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.582
- I'm into you and I'm hard.
- Yeah.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.056
- Hey, I was born to fertilize.
- Yeah.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.286
- I'm a firefighter.
- Fuck off!

26:03.728 --> 26:05.525
Wait, I thought you took her to prom.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.566
Yeah,
but it was a just-friends kind of thing.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.065
You should bang her. We would.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.798
Dude, we would bang her so hard.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.341
We would take that ass and just...

26:22.213 --> 26:24.374
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you
if you're not into it.

26:24.449 --> 26:25.814
Yeah. Hard.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.114
- With our dicks!
- Yeah, our dicks are huge.

26:28.186 --> 26:31.314
You could see them from space!
What's up?

26:31.389 --> 26:34.358
- What's up?
- Hey, do you have a phone number?

26:35.460 --> 26:37.052
You don't. Okay.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.065
I'll call you from nationals.

26:48.406 --> 26:50.931
Say it.
- You're my little donut girl.

26:55.113 --> 26:58.776
- Bye, sexy.
- Yo, Ian.

26:59.918 --> 27:03.752
- You want to smell my finger?
- Yeah, okay.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.750
Are you sure you got the right hole?

27:18.670 --> 27:19.796
Kids.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.107
Awesome.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.150
Hmm... '69.

27:43.628 --> 27:44.720
Whoa.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.473
Don't puss out. Be cool.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.677
I don't know.

28:01.012 --> 28:06.917
That is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!

28:09.120 --> 28:12.089
Sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.

28:24.135 --> 28:25.602
Holy buckets.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.104
She wants me to give her the D.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.266
<i> Well, honey</i>

28:32.343 --> 28:33.332
<i>What ya got, Mr. Mans?</i>

<i>Now tell me, is that nasty girl you?</i>

28:43.621 --> 28:44.815

28:44.889 --> 28:51.453
<i>Could you be my nasty girl</i>
<i>and let me do that dirty dance with you?</i>

28:51.529 --> 28:53.622

29:11.349 --> 29:13.977

<i>Long if there ain't no big surprises</i>

29:19.424 --> 29:21.654
<i>Chances are you'll suit me to a T</i>

29:30.401 --> 29:31.732
Love beef.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.234
Terry, phone call.

29:41.246 --> 29:44.545
Dude, weren't you in my gym class?
What is it? Egan?

Yeah, yeah. Hey, Jordan.

29:51.656 --> 29:55.752
Right. Whatever, scrotch.
You can't get your fist pregnant.

Russ, man, check it out.
Yo, look who's buying jimmys.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.970
Dad, what did you do with my helmet?

30:34.332 --> 30:41.261
Ian, honey,
I made you some tollhouse cookies.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.574
I'll just leave these here for you.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.175
I'll get them later.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.815
There's $40 in the cow for fun money,

30:51.482 --> 30:54.883
so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.

30:56.354 --> 31:00.154
Anytime. It's your home now.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.850
Oh, dear.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.258
- Dude.
- Hey.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.359
What is going on with you?
You bought rubbers?

31:12.103 --> 31:14.571
- How did you know that?
- It's on Russ Miller's blog.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.803
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.312
What's the deal? Dude.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.784
She wants me to meet her tonight
at the Big Boy in Knoxville.

31:26.918 --> 31:30.820
This is a fucking written invitation
to your dick from the Internet.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.151
Oh, Jesus.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.521
Seriously, dude, pack your shit.
We're going to Knoxville.

31:34.592 --> 31:36.651
No. Stop it. Put these back.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.524
This is the type of girl who has...

31:38.596 --> 31:41.224
She has it shaved into a landing strip.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.032
I can't deal with a landing strip.

31:43.101 --> 31:45.763
Okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean,
she could have anything under there.

31:45.837 --> 31:50.399
There could be a little Hitler
or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.

31:51.943 --> 31:55.106
But I'm guessing this chick is baby fresh.

31:55.179 --> 31:59.047
You know, she doesn't even want me.
She wants him.

32:00.218 --> 32:03.984
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.148
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.949
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.723
Maybe. But what if she's not?

32:12.196 --> 32:15.688
You know, I mean, look, you've already
opened, and I could help you close.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.633
We just need one thing.

32:23.141 --> 32:27.771
Ian, just look at this.
I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO,

32:27.845 --> 32:30.473
she's gonna drop an egg right there
in the Big Boy parking lot.

32:30.548 --> 32:32.516
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.

32:33.584 --> 32:36.678
Here. Strap that end down. Tight.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.485
- The cord's too short.
- Put a little sack into it, powder puff.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.795
- All right. Thanks, little brother.
- Yeah.

32:47.198 --> 32:48.859
- Hey, Ian.
- Yeah.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.427
Did I hear something
about you wanting to borrow my car?

32:51.502 --> 32:54.164
No, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.468
You sure?

32:57.842 --> 33:01.300
You're my little brother, Ian.
All you gotta do is ask.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.440
Okay.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.074
Could I use The Judge this weekend?

33:13.024 --> 33:17.688
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive
The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.529
Let's go, Dad.
- What a dick.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.432
You should take his car just on principle.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.771
What do you want me to do, you know?

33:27.839 --> 33:30.399
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it,
since I don't even know what that means.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.942
What are you doing?

33:35.847 --> 33:38.873
No. Lance, no! Put it back.
Did you just hear him? Please.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.111
Come here, we're gonna have a talk.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.647
She's only nine short hours away, okay?

33:43.721 --> 33:46.588
We're gonna head down there tonight
and you're gonna put a dent in that shit.

33:46.657 --> 33:49.626
Ian's gonna treat it like it's meat
that needs tenderizing.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.389
With his dick instead of a hammer.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.589
You can pound it till it bleeds.

33:53.664 --> 33:57.293
Yeah, it's just a fucking girl's mess,
and then we're gonna be...

33:58.469 --> 34:01.131
- What're you doing?
- Still rolling.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.969
Who's gonna pound on it? Say it.
Ian's gonna pound on it.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.738
We're back tomorrow
before Rex even knows the car is gone.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.870
Now, listen, these girls at Madison are
gonna be fucking at a college level.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.072
I need you ready for that.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.408
Wait! Put it... Put it back.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.277
Back here.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.431
For God's sake. You two rump rangers
couldn't wait five minutes?

34:52.190 --> 34:53.315
Shit.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.432
- Shit!
- Fuck!

35:11.509 --> 35:14.034
I told her she could stay here this weekend.

35:14.545 --> 35:18.072
Dude, what the hell?
Why are you driving Rex's car?

35:18.149 --> 35:19.946
I thought me and...

35:21.686 --> 35:24.348
- Are you bitching out on me?
- No.

35:24.422 --> 35:25.616
- No.
- No.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.420
Good. Well, then where are we going?

35:29.427 --> 35:31.987
Um... Knoxville, Tennessee.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.564
Okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

35:34.632 --> 35:38.466
Okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.159
Dude, what the fuck?

35:40.238 --> 35:42.069
- I don't want her along.
- Really?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.301
You don't want to bring Yoko
on your sex trip?

35:44.375 --> 35:46.707
Yeah, no shit.
She's always cock-blocking you.

35:46.777 --> 35:49.337
No, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...

35:49.413 --> 35:51.608
Okay, twat blocking.

35:51.682 --> 35:52.774
Professor.

35:52.850 --> 35:53.874
When will you
be coming back?

35:53.951 --> 35:55.282
No, tomorrow.

35:55.353 --> 35:58.413
When?
- No. Bye! God.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.821
You guys
drive safe now. Bye!

36:01.392 --> 36:03.087
So, what's in Tennessee?

36:03.761 --> 36:06.525
My grandma has got some cancer.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.162
- Grammy K?
- She's fine.

36:09.467 --> 36:12.527
She's gonna live forever. Well, a long time.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.635
It's, you know... I mean, what is it called?

36:15.706 --> 36:17.765
- It's foot cancer.
- She's got a little foot cancer.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.037
She'll be hopping around in no time.

36:20.878 --> 36:23.278
So what's she doing in Tennessee?

36:23.548 --> 36:27.644
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass
cancer center there.

36:27.718 --> 36:31.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like... It's famous.

36:31.756 --> 36:34.384
- Yeah.
- So if you ever get any cancer,

36:34.458 --> 36:38.690
you should totally check it out.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.223
I would.

36:44.235 --> 36:48.535
So you want I-80 East and then
65 goes all the way through Indiana.

36:49.607 --> 36:51.507
- So how's it feel?
- What?

36:52.076 --> 36:55.978
I don't know, breaking the rules,
talking some shit, driving The Judge?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.739
It feels pretty good.

36:58.816 --> 37:01.114
<i> I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw</i>

37:01.185 --> 37:03.278
<i>I'm in the prime of my life</i>

37:07.625 --> 37:13.257
<i>Let's make some music, make some money</i>
<i>Find some models for wives</i>

37:17.101 --> 37:21.401
<i>This is our decision</i>
<i>To live fast and die young</i>

37:21.939 --> 37:27.070
<i>We've got the vision</i>
<i>Now let's have some fun</i>

37:29.380 --> 37:32.008
<i>I said, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:37.581
This dude wants to race.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.621
Let's go, ladies.

37:40.691 --> 37:43.387
Lance! Cut it out!
Come on, you don't know who's in there.

37:43.461 --> 37:47.591
Dude, I don't care if fucking Steve
McQueen's zombie corpse is in that car.

37:47.665 --> 37:50.657
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car
that looks like a Trapper Keeper.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.862
I am not racing in my brother's car.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.930
Holy shit.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.635
What the hell is that?

38:00.878 --> 38:02.937
Looks like a Nachos BellGrande.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.481
And a chalupa!

38:04.782 --> 38:06.147
Medium Coke!

38:07.518 --> 38:08.542
Go right!

38:08.719 --> 38:10.812
Turn the wipers on!
- They are on.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.512
They're not working!

38:12.723 --> 38:15.556
Please, don't yell at me.
I'm doing the best I can.

38:16.527 --> 38:17.960
- Winnebago!
- Where?

38:18.029 --> 38:19.860
Winnebago! Winnebago!

38:27.405 --> 38:29.498
Oh, my God, are you all right?

38:34.445 --> 38:37.846
Yeah, nobody offer to help.
I got this under control.

38:45.222 --> 38:49.386
- Are you all right?
- Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!

38:51.696 --> 38:56.565
You know what might make you feel better?
Putting 40 on pump two.

39:11.782 --> 39:15.616
Hey. You okay in there?

39:17.822 --> 39:21.781
God damn! My back teeth are snorkeling.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.088
Sweet relief.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.128
You got the shy bladder?

39:35.106 --> 39:36.437
- Yeah.
- Damn.

39:38.909 --> 39:42.140
Paruresis. That's what they call it.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.011
Let me tell you something.
I didn't catch your name.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.344
It's Ian.

39:46.417 --> 39:50.911
Let me tell you something, Ian.
I had it something fierce.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.893
You can do it, Ian. You can do it.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.692
Go running down by your sister.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.865
Excuse me, ma'am, that was my pump.

40:10.274 --> 40:13.937
Yeah? You move your meat,
you lose your seat. Hmm.

40:15.279 --> 40:18.737
Logan, do not eat that.
You will fuck up your appetite!

40:20.117 --> 40:21.209
Damn.

40:22.319 --> 40:24.480
Listen, Reba.

40:24.555 --> 40:29.083
If you value the rest of your teeth,
you will shut off that pump.

40:34.498 --> 40:37.899
So I tells my daddy, "You know what?
You're not the boss of me.

40:37.968 --> 40:41.563
"Not you, not Angie,"
that's that girl I was telling you about.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.698
"And sure as hell not this bladder of mine."

40:43.774 --> 40:45.867
Well, he looked at me,
and you should have...

40:45.943 --> 40:49.709
Ian. Where you going? Don't give up.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.551
Jesus. I've been pissing for an hour.

41:00.057 --> 41:04.050
- Another one for the collection.
- Cool. Thanks.

41:06.797 --> 41:07.889
What?

41:13.404 --> 41:16.601
It's okay, Brandy. It's okay, baby, don't cry.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.369
Lance, what are you doing?

41:18.442 --> 41:20.376
Dude, you should be ashamed of yourself,

41:20.444 --> 41:24.380
because I'm just trying to show
another human being a little compassion.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.381
And my dick.

41:28.886 --> 41:31.946
It's okay, baby. Just let those tears fall.

41:32.022 --> 41:34.422
You know why?
'Cause our love will dry them up.

41:34.492 --> 41:38.189
Love will keep us alive. Just like that song.
You know that song?

41:38.262 --> 41:42.392
That's our song now.
That song represents our bond.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.830
Don Henley's words represent our love.

41:53.310 --> 41:54.834
What have you got?

41:55.212 --> 41:57.646
Hey, kid, where you from?

41:59.083 --> 42:03.850
- I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago.
- Are you two married. No?

42:05.289 --> 42:11.125
- No, we're just friends. We're <i>amigos.</i>
- You make a good couple.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.391
She's pretty. Marry that girl.

42:14.498 --> 42:18.059
See my lady and I here,
we've been married forever.

42:18.135 --> 42:20.535
And I tell you she was gorgeous.

42:20.604 --> 42:24.040
The first day I saw her,
I said, "This is gonna be my wife."

42:24.108 --> 42:26.668
And you know what? It happened.

42:26.744 --> 42:30.407
I tell you,
that was a very good year for corn.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.847
Made lots of money.

42:32.917 --> 42:38.685
I fixed my 4X4 and bought my lady
a sexy French lingerie.

42:38.756 --> 42:41.884
Boy, those were the best six bucks
I ever spent.

42:44.161 --> 42:47.358
You kids want to help yourself
to a can of Purple?

42:47.765 --> 42:51.724
- Purple sounds great, Ian. Purple?
- Yeah, I can go...

42:54.371 --> 42:56.532
Say, the boys still hanging?

42:57.508 --> 43:01.000
- You ever had a peppermint fatty?
- No. Let's have that.

43:01.145 --> 43:03.045
See how that shoe fits.

43:06.483 --> 43:09.213
Oh my God. Do you have a degree in this?

43:11.522 --> 43:14.787
You know that thing,
when runners say they break the wall?

43:14.858 --> 43:17.520
You know, and it's all good after that?

43:17.962 --> 43:19.827
I feel like that
when my dick's in your mouth.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.298
It actually says Purple Soda.

43:28.138 --> 43:30.106
Bad boy.

43:34.845 --> 43:36.870
You like him, don't you?

43:39.950 --> 43:44.319
- What? Who?
- Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?

43:44.455 --> 43:49.256
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.

43:49.326 --> 43:53.194
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.

43:56.967 --> 44:00.027
Brandy!
- Uh-oh!

44:00.104 --> 44:03.130
Brandy! Shit.

44:06.010 --> 44:07.944
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

44:08.012 --> 44:12.881
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am.
Where the fuck's Brandy at?

44:21.959 --> 44:27.556
- You ever hear of a rolling brown-out?
- No. Let's try it.

44:29.199 --> 44:30.860
You bleach that.

44:31.402 --> 44:35.600
Wait. No, no, no, no! Nothing brown!
Nothing brown! Nothing brown!

44:35.673 --> 44:38.073
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?

44:38.342 --> 44:42.506
No, but I'm gonna
pummel his ass real good.

44:42.579 --> 44:44.945
There you go. There you go.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.005
Hey!

44:47.151 --> 44:48.482
I have to go to church.

44:49.353 --> 44:52.288
Come on, baby! Open the goddamn door!

44:58.195 --> 45:02.256
All right, this is not what it looks like.
It was a project for school.

45:02.332 --> 45:03.492
Purple Soda!

45:12.710 --> 45:13.904
Wiener!

45:17.848 --> 45:18.837
Ow!

45:41.171 --> 45:42.661
There you are.

45:44.908 --> 45:47.843
Come on, come on.
I do not want to die naked.

45:54.218 --> 45:58.484
Fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!

46:06.430 --> 46:10.025
Get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!

46:10.234 --> 46:14.295
I'm gonna ask you this just one time.
Did she give you the nugget?

46:14.705 --> 46:16.172
Hey, hold on!

46:17.841 --> 46:19.069
Come on, man, she's not worth it.

46:19.143 --> 46:21.839
She's just gonna shit all over you.
Trust me.

46:22.246 --> 46:25.272
- She touch your butthole?
- No, no. Jesus, no!

46:25.349 --> 46:27.977
- Let's see!
- I thought she was a man. I'm gay.

46:28.051 --> 46:29.643
I'm gay as hell.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.590
Eat bat, dickhead!

46:36.193 --> 46:37.626
Holy shit!

46:39.730 --> 46:40.890
Ian just killed that guy.

46:40.964 --> 46:43.091
Sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

46:43.167 --> 46:46.500
Look, I have my insurance card.
I'm sorry. We're from out of town.

46:46.570 --> 46:50.062
I couldn't see you through the corn.
I'm sorry.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.874
Where the hell's the road?
- It feels like left.

46:55.946 --> 46:57.106
I told you we didn't have time for this,

46:57.181 --> 46:59.445
- but all you care about is your stupid dick.
- Ian.

46:59.516 --> 47:01.177
And you leave us out there
with her mom's weird soda.

47:01.251 --> 47:03.651
- Ian.
- And her dad's balls in plain view...

47:03.720 --> 47:04.846
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!

47:04.922 --> 47:06.219
Motherfucker!

47:17.034 --> 47:20.231
Holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!

47:20.404 --> 47:24.204
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving.
Lance, you suck!

47:24.474 --> 47:26.772
Where the hell are we?
- Where are the Google maps?

47:26.844 --> 47:29.278
- They're in my pants.
- Which are?

47:29.980 --> 47:31.777
In the trailer.

47:33.450 --> 47:35.611
Mmm-hmm. Great.

47:36.320 --> 47:40.586
Shit. I got gum in my bush.

47:44.428 --> 47:46.794
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can
show us back to the highway.

47:46.864 --> 47:50.425
- Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker.
- Don't worry, I won't.

47:52.069 --> 47:53.866
No, no, no.

47:55.138 --> 47:57.038
Oh, my God.

47:59.276 --> 48:03.269
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man.
I've been out there for hours.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.409
Not one car. Can you believe it?

48:05.482 --> 48:08.110
- Listen, sir, we didn't...
- You're good people.

48:08.185 --> 48:11.643
- Guy, you're not wearing any pants.
- Yeah, I know.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.113
Right on.

48:13.190 --> 48:15.090
Let's go. We better go.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.525
Hey, you got my stuff.

48:20.998 --> 48:24.900
Hey, real quick, guys,
what's the story of the girl?

48:24.968 --> 48:28.961
- I'm 25 years old.
- I don't know what he's talking about.

48:38.615 --> 48:43.177
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.011
Got any in the trunk?

48:45.222 --> 48:47.816
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

48:47.891 --> 48:50.860
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

48:50.928 --> 48:53.726
- and you just piss in the radiator.
- Really?

48:53.964 --> 48:55.556
Yeah.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.827
Oh, God! Damn it!

49:00.270 --> 49:02.238
- Are you okay?
- Fuck. Yeah.

49:02.306 --> 49:04.001
That's a lesson learned.

49:06.643 --> 49:08.508
You can watch,
if you're into that kind of thing.

49:08.578 --> 49:12.014
Wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen
your dick enough for one day.

49:12.082 --> 49:16.917
Do you hear that? There's a ringing.
- Your loss. It's like razor blades.

49:16.987 --> 49:21.788
What? There's ants down here. FYI.

49:21.858 --> 49:26.625
All right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.

49:27.364 --> 49:30.629
Okay. Go away.

49:31.034 --> 49:35.164
Dude, seriously? Still?
I thought you got over this shit.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.174
You're a grown man.

49:45.549 --> 49:49.041
Flowing river, gentle stream.
Flowing river, gentle stream.

49:49.119 --> 49:53.579
- Yo, stage fright, how're we doing?
- Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.

49:54.992 --> 49:59.486
Excuse me.
We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.

50:00.030 --> 50:03.158
- Why?
- We just do.

50:04.501 --> 50:08.028
I'm sorry. I just took a squirt
a couple of minutes ago.

50:09.106 --> 50:11.097
You want me to shit in it?

50:12.209 --> 50:14.541
- We'll get back to you on that one.
- All right.

50:16.713 --> 50:19.307
- I'm telling you, I could shit right now.
- Awesome.

50:21.251 --> 50:24.243
Our new friend's got nothing left
in the tank.

50:28.792 --> 50:29.952
What?

50:33.563 --> 50:38.227
No. Guys, come on.
I don't have the aim that you do.

50:38.301 --> 50:42.032
Every drop helps so much.

50:43.440 --> 50:47.240
Hey, look what I found in my bag.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.641
Thank God.

50:49.079 --> 50:52.344
- No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

50:56.119 --> 51:00.078
You all just wait 20 minutes
and I'll top it off for you.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.284
Could be ten.

51:04.361 --> 51:08.127
Fine, fine. Okay.
But if any of you pervs peek,

51:08.198 --> 51:11.429
I swear to God it will be
your last conscious act.

51:19.376 --> 51:20.502
Shit.

51:35.158 --> 51:37.126
You kids need some help?

51:44.000 --> 51:45.024
Hi.

51:51.241 --> 51:52.435
Are you okay?

51:52.509 --> 51:55.637
Yeah, I'm great.
I just beaved a family of four.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.007
Try it.

52:03.487 --> 52:04.647
All set?

52:04.721 --> 52:07.554
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't give you a ride.

52:09.659 --> 52:11.752
I'm gonna say this once.

52:11.828 --> 52:15.821
You unlock this fucking car,
or God is my witness,

52:16.366 --> 52:18.527
I'll stake you all to the ground,

52:18.602 --> 52:21.867
cut you open and let the dogs get at you.

52:23.373 --> 52:24.362
Oh, yeah?

52:27.177 --> 52:29.372
Bye-bye.

52:34.518 --> 52:36.816
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

52:36.887 --> 52:38.718
What happened?
- It's stuck.

52:42.459 --> 52:43.824
Uh-oh.

52:43.894 --> 52:46.829
That didn't work out like you planned,
did it?

52:46.897 --> 52:51.266
You know what? Mostly I'm disappointed.
It shows zero character.

52:51.334 --> 52:52.892
I know, I'm sorry.

52:52.969 --> 52:54.630
And you're a dick.

52:55.205 --> 52:59.403
You're a dick. You know what, ma'am?
You're a dick, too.

53:04.147 --> 53:06.877
- Here's that pee you ordered.
- Roll them up.

53:08.818 --> 53:12.754
- There you go, Tex.
- You're soaked with pee.

53:12.822 --> 53:14.380
Quick car wash?

53:14.457 --> 53:16.891
- God!
- Gross.

53:16.960 --> 53:20.555
It smells like beef jerky. You know?

53:21.231 --> 53:24.291
It's just got like that sour sweetness.

53:26.436 --> 53:28.996
How can nobody go down a road
for an hour and a half?

53:29.072 --> 53:30.903
Why did they even make this stupid road?

53:30.974 --> 53:33.306
It's so hot out here.

53:33.376 --> 53:34.365
Ow!

53:37.814 --> 53:42.478
Oh, my God, your head.
Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.678
Yes. It hurts.

53:46.957 --> 53:50.393
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

53:53.964 --> 53:54.953
Wow.

54:07.644 --> 54:10.169
That is so beautiful.

54:19.389 --> 54:20.481
Need some help?

54:21.658 --> 54:26.686
- Yeah, but no offense...
- Right, 'cause I'm Amish,

54:26.763 --> 54:29.732
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

54:30.033 --> 54:33.799
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi,
something like that.

54:33.870 --> 54:36.896
Weird, that thing must have fallen
straight from space.

54:36.973 --> 54:39.669
Well, good luck with the future ride,
spaceman.

54:42.379 --> 54:44.506
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.

54:44.881 --> 54:46.041
Wow!

54:46.116 --> 54:47.140
Okay.

54:47.217 --> 54:51.517
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

54:51.688 --> 54:52.848
- What?
- Come on.

54:52.922 --> 54:55.447
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

54:55.525 --> 54:58.790
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

54:58.962 --> 55:01.624
But maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?

55:01.698 --> 55:02.995
I should.

55:05.502 --> 55:07.197
I can't believe you just did that.

55:07.270 --> 55:10.364
So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.930
The Internet?

55:12.309 --> 55:16.871
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

55:16.946 --> 55:18.277
Computers?

55:19.916 --> 55:23.511
A computer is like a big calculator,
you know, with the screen.

55:23.586 --> 55:25.918
I'm just busting your balls, man.
I know what the Internet is.

55:28.758 --> 55:30.817
- Okay.
- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

55:30.894 --> 55:33.328
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

55:33.396 --> 55:37.594
No, it means "run wild." It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

55:37.667 --> 55:40.227
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

55:40.303 --> 55:45.536
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

55:45.608 --> 55:47.974
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

55:48.044 --> 55:50.035
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

55:50.113 --> 55:53.310
Oh, no. I'm not. Not anymore.

55:53.383 --> 55:55.783
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you but...

55:55.852 --> 55:58.685
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

55:58.755 --> 56:02.213
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

56:02.292 --> 56:05.489
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

56:05.562 --> 56:06.586
Oh.

56:06.663 --> 56:12.363
And gambling. Went to Vegas once.
And buttfucking.

56:14.003 --> 56:16.198
Have a lot of nice memories there.

56:16.272 --> 56:18.103
I hear that.
- Oh, yeah.

56:18.942 --> 56:20.273
Buttfucking.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.812
Wait, are we talking about dudes?

56:24.547 --> 56:26.913
- No.
- Okay. Then yeah.

56:27.951 --> 56:31.785
I mean, unless that's what you're into,
and then, whatever.

56:31.855 --> 56:33.584
- It's not.
- No?

56:33.656 --> 56:34.645
No.

56:35.191 --> 56:37.853
- Not into dudes.
- No, no, no, no, no.

56:38.294 --> 56:40.819
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

56:42.432 --> 56:44.059
How old are you?

56:49.806 --> 56:51.637
This is gonna happen.

56:53.810 --> 56:56.142
It's gonna happen
whether you fight it or not.

56:56.212 --> 56:58.646
So I kind of want you to fight it.

57:00.283 --> 57:01.307
Cut.

57:01.384 --> 57:04.444
- All right. Now you.
- No way. Forget it.

57:04.521 --> 57:07.046
Dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.

57:07.123 --> 57:10.251
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

57:10.326 --> 57:13.887
To visit your grandma? Whoa!

57:14.030 --> 57:16.828
So anyway, we're there and she's like...

57:18.768 --> 57:19.757
Oh, yeah.

57:20.570 --> 57:21.764
Like, she won't stop crying.

57:21.838 --> 57:23.328
- That's the funniest thing, too.
- I know.

57:23.406 --> 57:27.240
I know, I was with this stripper in Vegas,
and I was like, "you want this?"

57:27.310 --> 57:30.905
So she's like, "Yeah, I want it, I want it."

57:32.148 --> 57:34.480
And I was like,
yeah, this gets hotter by the second.

57:34.551 --> 57:38.282
"What're you crying about?" She's like,
"...wanted to be a doctor."

57:38.354 --> 57:43.291
And I'm like,
"Yeah, you're a fucking Ph.D. of cock."

57:43.359 --> 57:45.259
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

57:45.328 --> 57:49.492
And then coercing my load
out on to the crying face.

57:49.566 --> 57:53.366
Vegas in general is just... Good times.

57:54.504 --> 57:56.665
You can get a blowjob for $10.

57:56.773 --> 58:00.971
Or for free if you meet the right girl
and tell her "I'm on Rumspringa."

58:01.044 --> 58:03.842
"What is this blowjob that you speak of?"

58:04.547 --> 58:06.913
"Your techno music beguiles me."

58:08.251 --> 58:10.310
Let me put it in your butt.

58:10.386 --> 58:12.081
You know, when you cut your foot on
a piece of glass,

58:12.155 --> 58:14.589
- don't think I'm gonna carry you.
- You know what? I will be fine. Okay?

58:14.657 --> 58:19.560
- I was born barefoot.
- Hey! Wait!

58:19.629 --> 58:22.689
Hey! Stop!

58:26.402 --> 58:28.393
Have a nice walk, shit-birds.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.005
Oh!

58:36.513 --> 58:39.141
Hey, Ian, Felicia, this is my boy, Ezekiel.

58:39.215 --> 58:40.910
What up, English?

58:49.859 --> 58:51.690
There's no service out here.

58:52.028 --> 58:55.054
- I can't even tell her I'll be late.
- Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.

58:55.131 --> 58:57.292
You don't want to come off as desperate.

58:57.367 --> 59:00.097
I'm driving nine hours.
How am I not coming off desperate?

59:00.169 --> 59:04.196
- We had shit to do.
- Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?

59:05.108 --> 59:07.872
You blew your head gasket.
That's not good.

59:07.944 --> 59:10.469
- Shit.
- Don't cry. We can fix it.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.674
- Really?
- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

59:12.749 --> 59:14.273
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

59:14.350 --> 59:15.476
but it's an impressive thing.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.383
- Yeah. We'll fix it.
- Wow, that'd be cool.

59:17.453 --> 59:21.685
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it?
I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

59:21.758 --> 59:22.986
- Wow.
- Wow.

59:23.993 --> 59:25.585
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

59:25.662 --> 59:28.256
That's what you say
when people do nice things for you.

59:28.331 --> 59:30.390
You know, there's a pretty big shindig
shaping up next door

59:30.466 --> 59:33.492
if you guys want to hang there
while we work on it.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.403
Take it easy while we do all this for you.

59:39.042 --> 59:42.534
- Does he have an attitude?
- No, he's fucking with you.

59:43.413 --> 59:44.573
Okay.

59:45.949 --> 59:49.783
Just relax, man.
I got a good feeling about this, you know.

59:49.852 --> 59:51.285
You're gonna party with the Amish.

59:51.354 --> 59:54.414
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
one kick-ass quilting bee.

59:57.393 --> 59:58.883
What's up, man?

59:58.962 --> 01:00:04.025
- Hey.
- No f-ing way!

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:11.039
<i>When I'm home alone</i>
<i>I just can't stop myself</i>

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.302
- This is insane!
- I know.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:23.809
<i>Signing off, " I'm all right in bed,</i>
<i>but I'm better with a pen"</i>

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:28.880
<i>I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen</i>

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:34.488
<i>I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen</i>

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:40.559
<i>The kid was all right, but it went to his head</i>

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:53.681
<i>Thank you, guys, very, very, very much.</i>
<i>You guys fucking rule, man.</i>

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:13.230
Dude. Don't even bother.
Your game is not gonna work on that girl.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:17.666
What do you know about girls?
I've never even seen you with a girl.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.638
I'm gonna go check on the car.

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.550
Yeah, fuck it. Let's dance.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:33.422
- Bite me. I'm not your consolation prize.
- Come on. Don't be hating.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.584
Fine.

01:01:51.354 --> 01:01:52.878
So at this point,
her panties are off,

01:01:52.955 --> 01:01:55.219
but I'm still apprehensive
about her husband being there,

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:56.849
'cause he is just staring at me.

01:01:56.924 --> 01:02:02.624
Whoa! Hey, what is this?
Why are the seats out?

01:02:02.697 --> 01:02:05.029
Ian, do you know anything
about fixing these old Pontiacs?

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:09.195
I don't care, okay?
Ezekiel, take all the pieces and just

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:12.330
- put them back in there. I don't want...
- Ian, you've gotta calm down.

01:02:12.406 --> 01:02:13.737
Do you know any breathing exercises?

01:02:13.808 --> 01:02:15.969
Because you are right on the verge
of a freak-out.

01:02:16.043 --> 01:02:20.844
You don't know my brother, okay?
He's gonna fuck my ass with a roll of quarters.

01:02:20.915 --> 01:02:24.544
What? He's gonna what? With what?

01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:29.385
Oh, yeah! He's gonna go get off work early,
and he's gonna walk into the bank,

01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:31.550
stand in line, change a 10,

01:02:31.692 --> 01:02:35.526
find my ass and just fuck it
with a roll of fucking quarters.

01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:52.408
Yeah, witness sucks!

01:02:53.981 --> 01:02:56.643
We've got to get that guy laid tonight.

01:02:57.084 --> 01:02:59.211
Is your sister still a slut?

01:03:24.478 --> 01:03:28.812
Check it out. It's totally working.

01:03:28.883 --> 01:03:31.113
You're the best wing-man ever.

01:03:31.185 --> 01:03:33.710
She's in, she's in. Watch this.

01:03:43.864 --> 01:03:47.129
Rumspringa! Whoo!

01:03:49.003 --> 01:03:51.335
- I took a wicked digger.
- Yes, you did.

01:03:51.405 --> 01:03:53.896
I think you may have had a little too much
to drink. Maybe you should...

01:03:53.974 --> 01:03:59.173
Maybe you should shut your face hole
'cause I've only had one beer ever.

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:05.583
- First day of Rumspringa?
- Rumspringa!

01:04:08.722 --> 01:04:10.314
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:13.985
Hey.

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:21.794
- All right. Okay. You good? All right.
- Aw! You guys are so nice.

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:23.860
Don't let her step in it.

01:04:25.573 --> 01:04:29.304
I love you guys 'cause you're awesome.

01:04:29.376 --> 01:04:31.207
'Cause you're awesome.

01:04:31.946 --> 01:04:34.972
Let's just find a safe place to sleep it off.

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:39.044
What? What's wrong with you?

01:04:39.286 --> 01:04:43.052
- Yeah, what's your problem, bitch?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.216
Nothing. She's fine. God, lay off.

01:04:46.527 --> 01:04:47.960
- It's Lance, right?
- No.

01:04:48.028 --> 01:04:50.394
I'll bet he's in there with that Amish girl
and you're out here.

01:04:50.464 --> 01:04:51.488
Wrong.

01:04:51.565 --> 01:04:54.432
Come on, Leesh, just drop
the hard-ass thing for two minutes.

01:04:54.501 --> 01:04:58.130
You know. It's okay. You're into Lance.

01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:04.008
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Look, there's something about Lance.

01:05:05.145 --> 01:05:09.377
Everybody likes Lance. I like Lance.

01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:13.820
Just promise me
you won't ever be like Lance.

01:05:15.756 --> 01:05:20.557
What is wrong with us?
Let's go have some fun. Come on.

01:05:21.095 --> 01:05:23.120
- No. No.
- No?

01:05:23.631 --> 01:05:28.568
Come on, we're young, and we're Amish,
and it's Rumspringa.

01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:30.126
Rumspringa!

01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:00.229
Ian, you little cock-sucker!

01:06:38.172 --> 01:06:39.196
Ah!

01:06:39.273 --> 01:06:41.935
Leesh, you're so stubborn.
Look at your feet.

01:06:42.009 --> 01:06:44.307
They are fine. All right?

01:06:45.813 --> 01:06:48.077
Hey. What's the plan?

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:52.317
I might as well find a phone and call Rex

01:06:53.087 --> 01:06:57.114
- so he can get on with killing me.
- What about visiting your grandma?

01:06:57.358 --> 01:07:00.816
Yeah, dude. You been putting off
visiting your grandma for too long.

01:07:00.894 --> 01:07:04.159
- It's about time you visited Grandma.
- Yeah.

01:07:04.231 --> 01:07:09.464
Lance, you know,
I really do want to visit my grandma, but...

01:07:09.536 --> 01:07:14.405
Dude, I really can't stress enough how
much you're gonna enjoy visiting Grandma.

01:07:14.775 --> 01:07:18.336
You know, I visit my grandma sometimes
two or three times a week,

01:07:18.412 --> 01:07:21.609
and it is always a pleasure.
She's just a delight.

01:07:21.749 --> 01:07:22.773
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:22.883 --> 01:07:25.181
Our transportation is all over the floor
of that barn.

01:07:25.252 --> 01:07:26.583
Hey, Mary!

01:07:28.956 --> 01:07:29.945
Hi.

01:07:33.727 --> 01:07:37.026
Wow, you look beautiful.

01:07:37.498 --> 01:07:38.726
Oh, please.

01:07:38.799 --> 01:07:44.032
I mean, seriously, you wearing that,
churning some butter. Sexy.

01:07:44.104 --> 01:07:46.834
So I had the best time with you last night.

01:07:46.907 --> 01:07:48.340
Yeah, me, too.

01:07:48.409 --> 01:07:51.276
So you got my number.
You're gonna call me, right?

01:07:52.446 --> 01:07:53.640
No.

01:07:54.815 --> 01:07:57.545
"No." You're funny.

01:07:58.285 --> 01:08:03.985
I mean, Lance, I really like you,
but Rumspringa's over for me.

01:08:04.825 --> 01:08:06.918
- So...
- Rumspringa!

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.565
Sorry.

01:08:40.493 --> 01:08:41.688
You fixed it?

01:08:41.761 --> 01:08:45.254
Yeah, we hit a few snags,
but she's banging like a champ now.

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:48.198
Man, I don't even...
I don't even know what to say here.

01:08:48.268 --> 01:08:50.667
You know, I don't really have much...

01:08:50.737 --> 01:08:52.533
Oh, no, we're good. We're good.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:56.303
I mean, the opportunity to help a neighbor,
that's a gift.

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:59.942
Man, you're too... Here, thanks.
Thank you so much.

01:09:00.013 --> 01:09:01.674
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, it's really cool.

01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:03.716
It is. You know, I mean,

01:09:03.783 --> 01:09:07.117
if you felt the need to reciprocate
in some way,

01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:09.587
I mean, there's a lot of chores
that need to be done around here.

01:09:09.656 --> 01:09:13.752
Yeah, no, the only thing about that is
we're kind of behind schedule right now.

01:09:13.827 --> 01:09:15.852
Yeah, but, I mean,
we could totally come back.

01:09:15.929 --> 01:09:18.227
- We could hit you on our way back through.
- Okay.

01:09:18.298 --> 01:09:20.926
Yeah, you should.
You should really get on the road.

01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:25.836
I mean, you got a smooth-running
vehicle now, you know, 'cause we fixed it.

01:09:25.906 --> 01:09:30.741
- Yeah. No, but it's... So we're good?
- We're good. Yeah, technically.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:33.206
I mean, we fixed your car for free,
and you're leaving.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.908
So I'd say that makes us dead square.

01:09:37.317 --> 01:09:38.648
We'll come back. I promise.

01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:42.018
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Hey, no, seriously, we will.

01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:44.523
Okay. We'll all hold our breath
till you get back.

01:09:44.591 --> 01:09:47.685
On three, guys. Three, two...

01:09:57.371 --> 01:10:00.898
My stomach's killing me.
Tell me if you see a rest stop.

01:10:01.775 --> 01:10:03.208
You know, I really feel sorry for Mary

01:10:03.277 --> 01:10:07.145
because her lifestyle is keeping her
from being happy.

01:10:07.214 --> 01:10:09.444
And that's no way to live.

01:10:09.516 --> 01:10:13.316
Lance, don't you know your little theory of
"People want what they can't get."

01:10:13.387 --> 01:10:15.821
That's all she is. Ian, gas station.

01:10:15.889 --> 01:10:20.826
No. Felicia, this is different okay,
because she changed me.

01:10:20.894 --> 01:10:23.556
You know, I'm a butterfly now
because of her.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:28.226
Because when I'm with her,
I was like a spiritually whole human being.

01:10:28.302 --> 01:10:32.432
And if you don't believe that,
you can suck my dick.

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:55.451
Fuck. I know you didn't take my car, Ian.

01:10:55.696 --> 01:10:57.493
'Cause you're a big, giant pussy.
That's right.

01:10:57.564 --> 01:11:01.295
I'm gonna lift up this door
and my big fucking glorious bitchy Judge

01:11:01.368 --> 01:11:04.030
is gonna be sitting right there
gleaming at me,

01:11:04.104 --> 01:11:07.164
or I'm gonna have the fucking
neighborhood squirrels eat your asshole.

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:25.918
Want some of this?

01:11:31.465 --> 01:11:33.160
He took my fucking baby.

01:11:35.168 --> 01:11:36.499
Cocksucker!

01:11:40.674 --> 01:11:41.732
Shit!

01:11:41.808 --> 01:11:45.471
Hey, Knievel, what say you get
your bike out of the fricking road?

01:11:45.612 --> 01:11:48.103
<i> Hey! Hey!</i>

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:09.131
All <i>ocupado,</i> sport?

01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:17.206
Sounds like
someone's got one in sideways.

01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.277
Gents.

01:12:24.885 --> 01:12:29.083
Well, looks like we're up.
Go on, get in there.

01:12:37.631 --> 01:12:38.620
Oh!

01:12:39.566 --> 01:12:41.397
Am I getting a signal?

01:12:42.969 --> 01:12:46.200
Tasty, I got sidetracked last night.

01:12:47.274 --> 01:12:50.300
I had to party with some new homies.

01:12:53.046 --> 01:12:57.244
Tonight, 8:00 p.m. at Big Boy.

01:12:58.952 --> 01:13:00.715
I'm worth the wait.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:06.614
Yes!

01:13:14.735 --> 01:13:18.762
No! Oh, God! No, thank you! No, thank you!

01:13:21.842 --> 01:13:25.369
Hello? Little buddy? Hello.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.114
Spooner. Spooner. Spooner.

01:13:31.785 --> 01:13:35.448
Was that you screaming in there?
- I don't want to talk about it. Ever.

01:13:35.522 --> 01:13:38.548
- Where's Felicia?
- She went to get corn dogs.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.048
Can you believe
the girls around here, man?

01:14:06.119 --> 01:14:10.112
But, man, where am I ever gonna find
another girl as cool as Mary?

01:14:13.326 --> 01:14:14.725
You like it?

01:14:19.499 --> 01:14:22.059
- What about Felicia?
- What about her?

01:14:25.505 --> 01:14:29.236
- She's into you.
- Yeah, no shit. Get in line.

01:14:29.309 --> 01:14:32.039
What is that?
She's not good enough for you?

01:14:32.112 --> 01:14:34.046
Felicia's awesome,

01:14:34.114 --> 01:14:37.242
but the obvious statement to make here
is that you like her.

01:14:38.084 --> 01:14:42.578
- What? No, I...
- You're shocked. You can't believe it.

01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:47.059
- This bombshell. Come on.
- You know, she's not into me anyways.

01:14:47.127 --> 01:14:51.188
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.
I still... I could never do that to you.

01:14:52.566 --> 01:14:56.400
Okay, but you do know
that she's not into you, right?

01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.930
- Yeah. Well, maybe you don't know.
- No. No, no, I'm gonna stop you.

01:15:01.007 --> 01:15:05.467
There's no maybe. Okay?
And I'm saying this as your best friend,

01:15:05.545 --> 01:15:11.142
but never. Never fucking ever. You know?

01:15:11.218 --> 01:15:12.480
Because you guys are friends.

01:15:12.552 --> 01:15:16.283
You know what every girl
I've ever banged had in common?

01:15:17.424 --> 01:15:19.654
I wasn't friends with any of them.

01:15:19.726 --> 01:15:23.184
And usually they have awesome tits,
but not always.

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:26.931
Sometimes you get that bronze medal,
you know?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.458
Real simple.
Climb the rope, hit the bell, win a prize.

01:15:30.537 --> 01:15:34.064
Hey, there, Bilbo Baggins,
there's no height requirement.

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:37.905
Why don't you step up
and win your girlfriend a prize?

01:15:37.978 --> 01:15:40.242
We're not... She's not my girlfriend.

01:15:40.313 --> 01:15:43.407
- What about your other girlfriend there?
- Nice.

01:16:01.067 --> 01:16:02.864
All right, come on, Ian. You can do it.

01:16:02.936 --> 01:16:06.099
Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there! Go, go, go!

01:16:06.306 --> 01:16:08.103
<i>Winner! Winner! Winner!</i>

01:16:09.476 --> 01:16:11.876
- That was awesome.
- How the hell did you do that?

01:16:11.945 --> 01:16:14.140
We had one of these at Cub Scout camp.
I kind of mastered it.

01:16:14.214 --> 01:16:16.239
Yeah, you think you're hot shit?

01:16:18.285 --> 01:16:21.220
- Lolly?
- Thank you.

01:16:24.958 --> 01:16:26.687
Hey, hey, hey, ass.

01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:32.221
Hey. What's your secret?

01:16:32.299 --> 01:16:35.132
You just...
If you keep your shoulders down...

01:16:35.201 --> 01:16:37.863
- No coaching.
- What?

01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:40.637
No coaching there, Lombardi.
Read the sign.

01:16:41.908 --> 01:16:43.307
No coaching.

01:16:45.645 --> 01:16:47.272
Cheese and rice!

01:16:47.814 --> 01:16:48.803
Oh!

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:53.617
- Thanks. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Ian.

01:16:54.187 --> 01:16:55.449
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:59.426 --> 01:17:03.624
- Consolation prize?
- Wow! Thank you so much.

01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:06.393
You know, my dance team's performing
over at the tent in a couple of minutes.

01:17:06.466 --> 01:17:07.831
You guys should come watch.

01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:10.734
- Actually, we were just about to go.
- That sounds super fun. He'll be there.

01:17:10.804 --> 01:17:12.465
Great. See you.

01:17:13.707 --> 01:17:15.937
Dude, that girl reeks of sex.

01:17:16.776 --> 01:17:18.266
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:21.674
Hey, Harry Potter,
take you and your girlfriends out of here.

01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:27.181
What are you looking at, Ellen DeGeneres?
I will crush you.

01:17:27.787 --> 01:17:30.381
That's right. I'm not afraid to hit a lady.

01:17:32.258 --> 01:17:35.352
<i>Everybody's talking all this stuff about me</i>

01:17:35.895 --> 01:17:38.921
<i>Why don't they just let me live?</i>

01:17:40.233 --> 01:17:41.666
<i>I don't need permission</i>

01:17:41.735 --> 01:17:43.635
- Do we really have time for...
- Hey, hey.

01:17:43.703 --> 01:17:45.364
You have to stop doing that to him.

01:17:45.438 --> 01:17:47.372
- Doing what?
- Twat blocking.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.603
I'm not twat... Doing that.

01:17:59.486 --> 01:18:03.786
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up for the AX Dancers!</i>

01:18:04.891 --> 01:18:08.224
<i>Come on, girls,</i>
<i>let's help me get some fellas up in here.</i>

01:18:10.096 --> 01:18:11.358
- Ian.
- Oh, no. Please.

01:18:11.431 --> 01:18:13.490
Get up there. Come on.

01:18:13.566 --> 01:18:14.828
Come on!

01:18:15.702 --> 01:18:17.431
<i>In the back! In the back!</i>

01:18:17.737 --> 01:18:19.830
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:18:23.109 --> 01:18:25.100
<i>Come on, two more, two more!</i>

01:18:27.213 --> 01:18:28.202
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:18:31.217 --> 01:18:32.741
Dude, turn around.

01:18:41.094 --> 01:18:46.498
<i>Look at this fine crop</i>
<i>of handsome fellas I got here.</i>

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:50.897
<i>But before we get down to business,</i>

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:52.494
<i>there's a young woman here</i>

01:18:52.572 --> 01:18:55.564
<i>who would like to share her story</i>
<i>with these young men.</i>

01:18:55.642 --> 01:18:59.635
<i>- Kristy, you ready, baby?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:19:02.482 --> 01:19:06.748
<i>So, last year I was at a dance</i>
<i>with my boyfriend.</i>

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.913
<i>He wanted to go to his car.</i>

01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:10.851
<i>So I did.</i>

01:19:11.391 --> 01:19:16.886
<i>So we were both naked in the back seat</i>
<i>and we started having oral...</i>

01:19:41.221 --> 01:19:42.813
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:19:55.902 --> 01:19:57.836
<i>Daddy likes that!</i>

01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:01.365
Excuse me!

01:20:01.775 --> 01:20:07.145
<i>Excuse me!</i>
<i>Is this tragic story turning you on?</i>

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:22.357
<i>This courageous young lady pours</i>
<i>her heart out and this is getting you hot?</i>

01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:25.395
<i>It's time for you to pledge. Right now!</i>

01:20:25.899 --> 01:20:28.766
<i>Boy, you need this more than anybody.</i>

01:20:30.136 --> 01:20:32.297
Hey, keep a wrinkle in it, captain.

01:20:33.773 --> 01:20:38.233
I can't believe you took
a fucking abstinence pledge with a hard-on.

01:20:38.411 --> 01:20:39.469
It's classic.

01:20:39.546 --> 01:20:42.743
Look, I didn't even know what she was
talking about. That doesn't count! Okay?

01:20:42.816 --> 01:20:44.681
- Ian! Hey!
- It gets better.

01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:46.651
I am so proud of you!

01:20:47.153 --> 01:20:48.745
Get away from me. Is that what you do?

01:20:48.822 --> 01:20:52.155
You go out and you lure little dorks like me
into your little no-having-sex club?

01:20:52.225 --> 01:20:54.216
Ian, it's not like that at all.

01:20:54.294 --> 01:20:56.956
Just go away. Now.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.735
- I would've eaten your asshole, you know.
- Really?

01:21:03.803 --> 01:21:04.895
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:08.031
You can keep your stupid
flipping lollipop, anyway!

01:21:10.777 --> 01:21:13.041
- You are dead, psycho-virgin!
- No, no!

01:21:13.112 --> 01:21:15.046
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21:18.117 --> 01:21:22.554
Hey, are you sure you want to get
dental work done in Floater, Kentucky?

01:21:23.656 --> 01:21:26.022
Dr. Teddescoe will be with you present-like.

01:21:26.092 --> 01:21:27.582
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.839
Fine, okay, you were right.
My feet are killing me,

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:46.538
and I never should've tossed my shoes.

01:21:46.846 --> 01:21:50.748
No, come on.
I love that your shoes are in that tree.

01:21:53.453 --> 01:21:56.388
I do. That's premium Felicia.

01:21:57.624 --> 01:21:59.114
Felicia Alpine.

01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:01.148
Oh.

01:22:01.995 --> 01:22:06.193
- So what'd you do to her?
- Hmm?

01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:07.358
Smack her around a little bit?

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.600
She gets out of line, you pop her one?

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:13.332
- No. No, sir, I...
- I got you. I'm just teasing you, man.

01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:14.998
We have fun.

01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:18.034
- He didn't, though, did he?
- Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

01:22:18.111 --> 01:22:20.602
Blink twice if you feel you're in danger.

01:22:21.948 --> 01:22:24.041
Be back in a couple minutes.
I'm gonna wait for that to numb up.

01:22:24.117 --> 01:22:25.141
Mmm-hmm.

01:22:25.218 --> 01:22:27.243
Hands to yourself, O.J.

01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:33.316
Ian, you know the other night
at Lance's party?

01:22:36.029 --> 01:22:39.055
- Was I there?
- No, come on.

01:22:40.633 --> 01:22:42.498
Here.

01:22:46.072 --> 01:22:52.033
I mean, you know the only reason is
because I don't want to ruin our friendship.

01:22:53.246 --> 01:22:57.478
Totally, I mean friendship is awesome.
Good call.

01:22:58.685 --> 01:23:02.781
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

01:23:10.363 --> 01:23:14.959
- You won't.
- What are you thinking about?

01:23:17.337 --> 01:23:20.397
- What are you thinking about?
- I asked you first.

01:23:24.944 --> 01:23:26.138
You got a little loogie.

01:23:29.215 --> 01:23:31.240
I'm gonna go see if Lance...

01:23:31.317 --> 01:23:32.341
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:32.418 --> 01:23:33.976
Go. Go.

01:23:46.199 --> 01:23:49.726
Um, I'll take these as well.

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:58.502
They're not for me. They're not.

01:24:07.186 --> 01:24:09.950
- Heads up.
- What's with you?

01:24:11.824 --> 01:24:13.883
I'm thinking maybe we head back home.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.723
What? Why?

01:24:15.962 --> 01:24:19.557
Well, Felicia and I were talking in there,

01:24:19.632 --> 01:24:23.363
- and we kind of had a moment.
- Oh! Oh, did you guys have a little moment?

01:24:23.436 --> 01:24:25.028
- Yeah.
- You're a moron.

01:24:25.671 --> 01:24:28.196
Fuck you. We've talked about this.

01:24:28.508 --> 01:24:31.671
Look, we're almost there,
and I'm not letting her do this.

01:24:31.778 --> 01:24:34.804
We're going to Knoxville,
and you're getting your nut.

01:24:35.515 --> 01:24:37.608
No, I'm not. I'm not.

01:24:37.683 --> 01:24:40.481
No, I'm gonna text Tasty,
and I'm gonna tell her I'm not coming.

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:43.818
- Ian, get in this car.
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:48.818
Shit, where's my phone?
Hey, you got a new smile.

01:24:48.895 --> 01:24:52.194
You have my phone. I didn't know...
This is for you.

01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:55.130
Mmm! A message came in.

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:58.235
Your grandma says she's really excited
to see you.

01:24:58.304 --> 01:25:00.636
And something about her hot,
shaved pussy.

01:25:00.706 --> 01:25:02.037
Must be the cancer talking.

01:25:03.209 --> 01:25:06.178
All right. Good deal.
We're going to Knoxville.

01:25:10.016 --> 01:25:11.005
<i>All I've got is frustration, frustration</i>

01:25:14.353 --> 01:25:17.550
<i>I hate this vacation</i>

01:25:18.191 --> 01:25:20.659
<i>So, give up, give up</i>
<i>Give up, give up</i>

01:25:21.861 --> 01:25:25.524
<i>I've got to get away from here</i>
<i>It's killing me just thinking 'bout</i>

01:25:25.598 --> 01:25:30.535
<i>Frustration, frustration</i>
<i>I hate this vacation...</i>

01:25:30.603 --> 01:25:33.071
Ian, you're going the wrong way.

01:25:33.339 --> 01:25:35.307
- We're going home.
- What?

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:38.867
Please, do not turn around
because of me. Okay.

01:25:38.945 --> 01:25:41.277
- Yeah, no shit.
- I'm dying to see Ms. Tasty.

01:25:41.347 --> 01:25:42.712
This is going to be hilarious.

01:25:42.782 --> 01:25:45.250
A hundred bucks says she has a wiener.

01:25:45.318 --> 01:25:48.219
Look, I said we're going home.
I don't want to talk about it.

01:25:48.287 --> 01:25:49.879
I knew you'd find some way
to fuck this up for him.

01:25:49.956 --> 01:25:53.357
Me? You two are fucking scheming
behind my back.

01:25:53.426 --> 01:25:55.792
- No, we're not.
- Okay. You stole Rex's car.

01:25:55.862 --> 01:25:57.557
You drove halfway across the country.

01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:00.622
This must be what you want to do.
So do it, chicken shit!

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.100
- Fucking A, chicken shit.
- Fine! You know what?

01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:06.161
I'll turn the car around, I'll flip a bitch,
and I'll go pork somebody. Right now.

01:26:06.239 --> 01:26:07.706
I'll be that guy. Is that what you want?

01:26:07.773 --> 01:26:09.570
- Be that guy! That guy rules.
- Sounds awesome.

01:26:09.642 --> 01:26:13.237
- That would make me so happy.
- All right. All right. Fantastic! I'm doing it.

01:26:13.412 --> 01:26:16.347
Watch out, Ian! Fuck!
- Watch it, Ian!

01:26:18.551 --> 01:26:19.677
Whoo!

01:26:20.853 --> 01:26:23.378
You like that?
- Did your fucking balls just drop?

01:26:23.456 --> 01:26:24.946
Holy shit, Ian.

01:26:25.892 --> 01:26:32.593
- Oh, man, it's this douche again.
- You want it? You got it.

01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:35.634
- Hold on to your pantyhose.
- Okay, we gotta work on your banter,

01:26:35.701 --> 01:26:37.931
but otherwise, this is awesome.

01:26:40.873 --> 01:26:43.671
- You're losing him.
- No, I got him. I got him.

01:26:46.078 --> 01:26:49.809
- Jesus, Ian! Not so close.
- God damn it!

01:26:54.387 --> 01:26:56.355
No way, man! You're dead.

01:26:58.357 --> 01:27:00.257
Sorry. He's all right.

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.454
This guy's fucking dangerous!

01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:10.696
Where is he? Talk to me, dudes.

01:27:10.803 --> 01:27:13.397
Right up our ass. He's in our ass.

01:27:18.077 --> 01:27:21.274
He's tagging out.
- Ladies!

01:27:21.347 --> 01:27:22.371
Ian, look out!

01:27:28.621 --> 01:27:29.918
Oh! Oh!

01:27:29.989 --> 01:27:31.149
God damn it.

01:27:32.925 --> 01:27:36.656
What were you doing, man? Shit.

01:27:38.197 --> 01:27:40.791
Dude, take it easy. This wasn't your fault.
He jumped right in front of you.

01:27:40.866 --> 01:27:43.801
Just shut up, Lance. Of course it's my fault.

01:27:44.136 --> 01:27:45.603
Now, come on, man,
this possum's not gonna fuck you.

01:27:45.671 --> 01:27:47.229
We gotta go find Ms. Tasty.

01:27:47.306 --> 01:27:51.675
He's suffering, Lance. I'm not gonna
leave him here by himself. Okay?

01:27:52.945 --> 01:27:55.675
Okay. You're right.

01:27:57.617 --> 01:28:00.916
We gotta help him.
We gotta call a vet or something.

01:28:01.454 --> 01:28:06.517
Ian, look at him.
There's not a lot that we can do.

01:28:08.227 --> 01:28:10.923
You may want to cover your eyes,
sweetheart, there could be some splatter.

01:28:10.997 --> 01:28:14.160
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out of his misery.

01:28:14.233 --> 01:28:17.760
They don't make little wheelchairs for him.
He's done, man.

01:28:17.837 --> 01:28:21.603
Fuck you, Lance.
God, you don't even give a shit about him.

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:24.240
I'll do it.

01:28:33.452 --> 01:28:34.783
I'm sorry.

01:28:39.025 --> 01:28:40.822
All possums go to heaven.

01:28:42.061 --> 01:28:47.863
Uh... Ian. It... I think it's still...

01:28:49.001 --> 01:28:50.400
Shit.

01:28:57.576 --> 01:28:59.510
Oh, no.

01:29:00.246 --> 01:29:03.477
Ian, I'm so sorry, it's...

01:29:03.549 --> 01:29:09.510
Oh, God! Jesus fucking... God damn it!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:14.888
- He's really hanging in there.
- God! Fuck!

01:29:15.828 --> 01:29:19.787
You know, Jamie Lynn Spears' baby
has got to be about a year old now.

01:29:19.865 --> 01:29:21.423
I can't believe she had a fucking baby.

01:29:29.075 --> 01:29:31.100
How was I supposed to know
it was an endangered possum?

01:29:31.177 --> 01:29:33.839
You know, the vet said there's actually
a good chance he might pull through.

01:29:33.913 --> 01:29:36.404
You better hope so, mister. Get in.

01:29:38.517 --> 01:29:40.007
Lock up cell B.

01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:47.449
We are in jail.

01:29:56.769 --> 01:29:59.704
Okay, listen, you have got to be cool,
'cause if they see you shitting yourself

01:29:59.772 --> 01:30:00.830
they're gonna fuck with us.

01:30:00.906 --> 01:30:02.897
Hey! Hey, ladies.

01:30:03.142 --> 01:30:06.703
Hey, how about you sit the fuck back down
before me and you have a problem?

01:30:06.779 --> 01:30:10.510
How about you just chill out, man?
Be cool.

01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:13.108
- All right. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:29.599
- Excuse me.
- Listen, old man, I'm only gonna tell you...

01:30:31.404 --> 01:30:33.770
You should've seen the look in his eyes.

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:37.173
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:42.109
Shit, that boy Ian don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:45.981
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

01:30:46.452 --> 01:30:48.477
I think that's real sweet.

01:30:48.554 --> 01:30:51.819
Well, I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

01:30:52.324 --> 01:30:55.919
The only way you can keep his kind around
is to get his babies up in you pronto.

01:30:55.995 --> 01:30:58.429
But he got no respect for bitches.

01:30:59.265 --> 01:31:03.964
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

01:31:05.204 --> 01:31:07.638
You love Ian, don't you, baby?

01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:15.271
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

01:31:15.748 --> 01:31:19.240
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

01:31:19.552 --> 01:31:22.112
You give your heart to that boy,

01:31:22.188 --> 01:31:27.558
and you can toss that "friendship" right out
the motherfucking window.

01:31:27.626 --> 01:31:33.223
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:39.763
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

01:31:40.973 --> 01:31:45.672
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

01:31:45.744 --> 01:31:48.076
So I tell him I love him.

01:31:48.614 --> 01:31:50.104
What happened?

01:31:53.252 --> 01:31:54.947
We dated for a few weeks.

01:31:56.121 --> 01:31:58.521
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

01:31:59.892 --> 01:32:02.224
We still talk from time to time.

01:32:03.395 --> 01:32:05.920
But it was never the same between us.

01:32:13.239 --> 01:32:19.542
Baby. Come here.
Come on, now. Come on, now.

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.847
You know you need a hug.
Come on, honey.

01:32:26.285 --> 01:32:27.809
Cuddle up.

01:32:31.891 --> 01:32:32.880
Dude.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:37.889
- What?
- Look, you're pissing in front of everybody.

01:32:40.666 --> 01:32:42.258
Yeah, I am.

01:32:42.334 --> 01:32:45.633
- And that guy's looking right at your dick.
- Atta-boy.

01:32:47.907 --> 01:32:51.468
- Look at you. You're a new man.
- No, I'm not.

01:32:51.677 --> 01:32:56.341
Dude. You stole a car, ran over a hillbilly,

01:32:56.415 --> 01:32:59.441
you got arrested, you got in a prison fight.

01:33:00.219 --> 01:33:02.119
See Duane, he was there.

01:33:02.187 --> 01:33:04.815
And I mean, you really beat
an endangered species to death today.

01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:06.551
That's got to count for something.

01:33:06.625 --> 01:33:10.857
And now you're in here in jail pissing
like a big dog in front of all the perverts.

01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:12.557
I mean, there's only one thing left.

01:33:12.631 --> 01:33:15.896
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

01:33:17.136 --> 01:33:19.001
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

01:33:19.071 --> 01:33:22.370
She'll think that's bad-ass,
because it totally is.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:26.401
Lafferty, Nesbitt, your bail has been posted.

01:33:26.612 --> 01:33:27.636
Really?

01:33:27.813 --> 01:33:31.840
- Time to go.
- Shit!

01:33:31.917 --> 01:33:34.351
- What?
- Rex.

01:33:34.653 --> 01:33:35.642
Oh.

01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:39.917
All right, this is it for us, Duane,

01:33:39.992 --> 01:33:41.823
but, you know, back to what we were
talking about earlier,

01:33:41.894 --> 01:33:43.987
I don't give a shit what Denise says,

01:33:44.063 --> 01:33:46.657
I think there's still room for somebody
to write the great American novel.

01:33:46.732 --> 01:33:49.758
So take that for whatever it's worth, buddy.

01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:59.202
Hey.

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:02.470
Mary!

01:34:07.319 --> 01:34:09.253
Wait. Wait. How did you find me?

01:34:09.321 --> 01:34:12.347
Well, I called your cell phone,
and then someone answered here.

01:34:12.424 --> 01:34:17.794
- That's awesome. Okay.
- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

01:34:20.165 --> 01:34:21.154
I mean, there's a number of charges,

01:34:21.233 --> 01:34:23.428
but the most prominent ones
were animal cruelty

01:34:23.502 --> 01:34:25.561
and the assaulting the officer.

01:34:25.638 --> 01:34:28.198
But it's not nearly as bad
as it sounds on paper, okay? I promise.

01:34:28.273 --> 01:34:31.333
- Okay.
- Okay. Wait right here. Okay.

01:34:33.178 --> 01:34:34.668
- Teddy.
- Lance, my man.

01:34:34.747 --> 01:34:37.011
- You guys got my stuff?
- It's gonna be a few minutes.

01:34:37.082 --> 01:34:38.140
All right.

01:34:38.217 --> 01:34:40.014
- Your daughter still selling those cookies?
- Yes.

01:34:40.085 --> 01:34:42.713
You find me that wallet, I'll buy one.

01:34:42.788 --> 01:34:44.813
- That'd be nice of you.
- How is she now?

01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:48.917
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't need one more charge brought.

01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:18.886
<i> You can't know, oh, no</i>
<i>You can't know</i>

01:35:18.957 --> 01:35:24.589
<i>How much I think about you, no</i>

01:35:25.698 --> 01:35:28.758
<i>It's making my head spin</i>

01:35:31.937 --> 01:35:35.395
<i>Looking at you</i>
<i>And you are looking at me</i>

01:35:35.474 --> 01:35:39.035
<i>And we both know what we want</i>

01:35:42.047 --> 01:35:44.015
<i>So close to giving in</i>

01:35:45.818 --> 01:35:52.724
Ian, don't do this. No,
don't turn into Lance. You're a good guy.

01:35:53.392 --> 01:35:55.656
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.

01:35:55.728 --> 01:36:00.529
So what if you're a virgin?
God, Ian, it's just sex. It's not...

01:36:00.599 --> 01:36:05.764
No, Felicia, it's not about the sex.
It's not. I'm weird.

01:36:05.838 --> 01:36:09.535
I'm the only virgin I know.
I need to get this done

01:36:10.242 --> 01:36:13.143
so everyone can just stop
freaking out about it.

01:36:13.545 --> 01:36:16.412
Look, I know you don't approve,
but I'm sorry, I just...

01:36:16.482 --> 01:36:18.074
I'm not going home a virgin.

01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:20.015
Then, sport, fuck me.

01:36:22.421 --> 01:36:23.581
What?

01:36:25.424 --> 01:36:28.086
Sport, fuck me and not some stranger.

01:36:29.261 --> 01:36:32.719
We're friends so you know
you're not gonna get some, like,

01:36:32.798 --> 01:36:37.064
crabs or genital warts
or some pussing thing that's coming...

01:36:37.136 --> 01:36:39.661
Wow, Leesh. That's hot!

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.598
You know what?

01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:48.706
I think I'd rather stay a virgin forever
than lose it on pity-sex.

01:36:49.348 --> 01:36:52.283
- I'm not talking about pity-sex.
- Then what are you talking about?

01:36:52.351 --> 01:36:55.479
I don't know. Sex.

01:36:56.188 --> 01:37:02.184
It doesn't have to mean anything.
It doesn't have to jeopardize our friendship.

01:37:02.594 --> 01:37:03.618
Ah!

01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:06.425
Leesh, you know what?
Fuck the friendship!

01:37:07.266 --> 01:37:09.029
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:13.231
I can't be the guy that you're gonna talk to
about your boyfriends anymore. I can't...

01:37:13.605 --> 01:37:16.005
I can't be the guy who's gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night,

01:37:16.074 --> 01:37:20.443
and you're gonna cry to because
Derrick Dicottes found some other girl.

01:37:21.647 --> 01:37:25.674
And maybe I'm just being selfish here,
but it is not enough.

01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:29.152
Okay, so I'm gonna go out that door,
and I'm gonna go have meaningless sex

01:37:29.221 --> 01:37:34.318
with some random, hopefully hot, hopefully
female person that I met on the Internet.

01:37:36.395 --> 01:37:39.125
Unless you've got something better
to say to me.

01:37:56.448 --> 01:37:58.313
That's what I thought.

01:38:27.412 --> 01:38:28.902
Cyclops.

01:38:32.317 --> 01:38:36.151
- How'd you find me?
- You ever heard of LoJack, cheese-dick?

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.652
Come here.

01:38:42.761 --> 01:38:45.594
<i> Burn that mother down, y'all</i>

01:38:45.831 --> 01:38:47.230
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

01:38:47.466 --> 01:38:49.297
<i>Disco inferno</i>

01:38:49.401 --> 01:38:50.891
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

01:38:50.969 --> 01:38:51.993
<i>Burn that mother down</i>

01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:54.903
Come on, Rex, wait. The girl...
The one I told you about from the Internet.

01:38:54.973 --> 01:38:58.374
She's right across the street, Rex.
She wants to do it with me and everything.

01:38:58.443 --> 01:39:00.172
Like I give a shit!

01:39:13.025 --> 01:39:14.925
Get your shit, queer-bait!
We're going home.

01:39:14.993 --> 01:39:16.654
Okay. Okay, fine.

01:39:16.929 --> 01:39:18.920
Now!

01:39:18.997 --> 01:39:20.897
It probably wouldn't have changed

01:39:20.966 --> 01:39:24.424
all these feelings
that I've been having lately anyway.

01:39:26.038 --> 01:39:28.529
What are you talking about?

01:39:28.607 --> 01:39:32.475
I don't know, Rex. You know, just feelings,

01:39:34.079 --> 01:39:39.073
curiosity about men.

01:39:41.586 --> 01:39:43.213
Oh, shit, Ian!

01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:49.617
I think you might be right.
I think I might be getting gay.

01:39:49.828 --> 01:39:54.322
God damn it. Fuck!

01:39:55.634 --> 01:39:58.933
But I just haven't had
any luck with girls, Rex.

01:39:59.004 --> 01:40:02.963
No way! No way my little brother's
taking it in the chili ring.

01:40:09.681 --> 01:40:12.878
All right, you take the car,

01:40:13.785 --> 01:40:16.583
and you go bang the female woman
like the good Lord intended.

01:40:16.655 --> 01:40:18.145
You've got one hour!

01:40:19.057 --> 01:40:20.957
- Ian.
- Yeah?

01:40:23.295 --> 01:40:25.160
Fill up the tank, would you, buddy?

01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:27.790
- Tank is at a little low. Yeah, thanks.
- Right.

01:40:49.855 --> 01:40:54.121
Hey, man. You looking for somebody?

01:40:58.063 --> 01:40:59.325
Ms. Tasty.

01:41:00.632 --> 01:41:01.826
Ian?

01:41:08.206 --> 01:41:11.437
Oh, my gosh! Hey.

01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:13.842
I was sure you were standing me up.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.876
- But here you are. Look at you.
- See you.

01:41:19.951 --> 01:41:22.977
You look a little different than your picture.

01:41:23.055 --> 01:41:26.650
Yeah, I know. I lost a lot of weight
'cause I had the runs... The flu.

01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:32.821
Well, you're mighty cute,
and your car is really pretty.

01:41:33.698 --> 01:41:35.563
Why don't you take me for a ride?

01:41:41.339 --> 01:41:45.105
So, Ms. Tasty, what's your real name?

01:41:46.511 --> 01:41:52.643
- How about I tell you after?
- Yeah, sure.

01:41:54.653 --> 01:41:56.280
Works for me.

01:42:03.528 --> 01:42:10.331
<i>... below the ocean</i>
<i>Where I wanna be</i>

01:42:11.002 --> 01:42:13.027
<i>She may be</i>

01:42:13.105 --> 01:42:16.472
<i>Way down below the ocean...</i>

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:19.704
- No, Mary, wait.
- What?

01:42:19.778 --> 01:42:23.179
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I mean...

01:42:23.748 --> 01:42:27.878
Nothing, I just... I really like you,

01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:34.992
and I don't want to ruin this. You know?

01:42:35.861 --> 01:42:40.855
But, hey, maybe you could come
to Chicago and we could hang out

01:42:40.932 --> 01:42:42.763
- and take it a little...
- No.

01:42:42.868 --> 01:42:46.702
Lance, it doesn't work like that.

01:42:50.142 --> 01:42:53.578
And, I mean, if I don't go back,
I'm gonna be shunned.

01:42:55.046 --> 01:42:57.344
I could never see my family again.

01:42:58.917 --> 01:43:03.320
- This Amish thing is a real motherfucker.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

01:43:12.397 --> 01:43:14.126
- Ian.
- Yeah.

01:43:14.199 --> 01:43:16.429
I think we should take our clothes off.

01:43:18.303 --> 01:43:20.100
Wow. Really? Right here?

01:43:20.172 --> 01:43:21.161
Mmm-hmm.

01:43:21.606 --> 01:43:24.769
No one's around for miles. Come on.

01:43:25.677 --> 01:43:26.803
Okay.

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:38.656
- What do you think?
- Thank you.

01:43:40.358 --> 01:43:45.819
That is one of the better sets
that I've seen today.

01:43:46.264 --> 01:43:48.459
I appreciate your honesty.

01:43:49.467 --> 01:43:50.695
They're nice.

01:43:51.436 --> 01:43:53.063
Really?

01:43:53.138 --> 01:43:55.732
You're fit.

01:43:55.807 --> 01:43:59.766
- You're so sweet.
- Yeah.

01:44:01.613 --> 01:44:05.105
I think we should
take your clothes off now.

01:44:05.183 --> 01:44:08.414
Yeah, maybe we should.

01:44:08.486 --> 01:44:13.549
- I don't play football!
- Okay.

01:44:13.625 --> 01:44:15.889
I... I really don't.
I mean, I don't really even watch football.

01:44:15.961 --> 01:44:18.088
I mean, I got all that stuff
from <i>Friday Night Lights,</i>

01:44:18.163 --> 01:44:21.132
which is a show. It's also a movie
starring Billy Bob Thornton.

01:44:21.199 --> 01:44:23.190
- I don't know if you saw it, but...
- Ian.

01:44:23.268 --> 01:44:29.332
What? You think everything in my profile's
the God's honest truth? No.

01:44:29.407 --> 01:44:32.308
Now, come on, take your clothes off.

01:44:34.713 --> 01:44:39.343
Look, there's this girl...

01:44:40.418 --> 01:44:44.650
Ian, this can be our little secret.
No one has to know.

01:44:46.191 --> 01:44:47.681
Now come here.

01:45:01.139 --> 01:45:06.167
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't do this with you.

01:45:06.244 --> 01:45:10.943
I'm kissing you,
and I'm thinking about somebody else.

01:45:11.850 --> 01:45:15.752
No, and I know that's a stupid thing to say.
I mean, she's not even...

01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:21.650
Oh, no, no, no.
Ms. Tasty, please don't cry.

01:45:21.726 --> 01:45:25.492
It's not a reflection of...
You're so pretty, like...

01:45:26.197 --> 01:45:27.892
You're laughing.

01:45:27.966 --> 01:45:30.935
Just take your fucking clothes off, asshole!

01:45:32.037 --> 01:45:35.438
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean to lead you on here,

01:45:35.507 --> 01:45:39.967
and I'll give you a ride home,
but I don't think that... What the fuck?

01:45:40.045 --> 01:45:42.479
What's up with the bandana, dude? Huh?

01:45:42.847 --> 01:45:44.246
What're you, a Gap model?

01:45:46.885 --> 01:45:49.979
- Do you have any jacks?
- Yup.

01:45:51.389 --> 01:45:54.916
- I win.
- Again.

01:45:54.993 --> 01:45:56.221
Yup.

01:46:00.598 --> 01:46:03.123
- All right, just take your shirt off.
- Okay, good.

01:46:06.204 --> 01:46:10.470
You were right, Ian. '69 Judge.
You were worth the wait.

01:46:13.378 --> 01:46:18.441
- Please, no! Come on, it's not even my car!
- And good luck with the lady friend.

01:46:21.086 --> 01:46:22.383
Fuckface!

01:46:25.724 --> 01:46:29.160
Felicia. Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:32.855
Oh, Bobby,
you were so awesome back there.

01:46:32.931 --> 01:46:34.694
- Love you so much.
- Cool.

01:46:35.967 --> 01:46:40.427
Hey, you know, I was thinking, do you
always have to flash them the twins?

01:46:40.505 --> 01:46:42.666
You know, I mean, I do got a gun.

01:46:42.741 --> 01:46:47.701
- Oh, baby, you know they're only for you.
- Okay, cool.

01:46:47.779 --> 01:46:50.805
Now, listen. I got another car coming
any minute now, okay?

01:46:50.882 --> 01:46:52.577
- Got it.
- So take me back to the Big Boy

01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:55.050
- and get this goat over to Luis.
- Right.

01:46:56.421 --> 01:47:02.621
And where is Luis? 5th and Crescent!

01:47:03.194 --> 01:47:05.424
- I fucking told you.
- I know where it is.

01:47:10.068 --> 01:47:15.301
And if you do good,
momma's gonna take real good care of you.

01:47:15.673 --> 01:47:16.901
Really?

01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:21.972
You mean the thing I like well?

01:47:27.185 --> 01:47:31.053
Yeah, just want to make sure we're talking
about the same thing here.

01:47:31.122 --> 01:47:33.090
The pepper grinder.

01:47:37.128 --> 01:47:39.221
Pepper grinder!

01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:43.029
Pepper grinder! Yeah.

01:47:51.309 --> 01:47:52.367
Hi.

01:47:58.349 --> 01:48:01.910
- Hey, boys. You finally made it.
- What's up, Ms. Tasty?

01:48:01.986 --> 01:48:04.511
What's up? What's up?

01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:07.217
- Damn, you're hot as fuck.
- Yeah.

01:48:07.292 --> 01:48:10.591
- We brought beers and rubbers.
- And some lotion for your tits.

01:48:11.863 --> 01:48:13.524
- It's not a marathon.
- It's a sprint.

01:48:13.598 --> 01:48:16.032
- Bang. Yeah.
- In chicks.

01:48:30.081 --> 01:48:31.639
You Felicia?

01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:35.818
I'm Bobby Jo.

01:48:37.322 --> 01:48:38.346
Hi.

01:48:48.533 --> 01:48:53.163
I can't believe I'm banging an Amish chick.
I mean, seriously, what are the odds?

01:48:54.272 --> 01:48:56.536
Oh, yeah! More of that.

01:48:58.576 --> 01:49:03.673
So, wait, you do want to party?

01:49:04.382 --> 01:49:05.508
With us?

01:49:05.583 --> 01:49:08.814
Yeah. I want us all to get naked and party.

01:49:21.299 --> 01:49:24.291
Fuck! I can't fucking believe this.

01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:31.573
Get your ass out of the car, motherfucker!

01:49:33.411 --> 01:49:38.075
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy fucking fuck-balls!

01:49:38.316 --> 01:49:42.480
Okay, my bad.

01:49:42.554 --> 01:49:44.249
Now, I thought you were someone else,
all right?

01:49:44.322 --> 01:49:49.692
You done fouled up my ride,
so I'm gonna have to take yours.

01:49:50.562 --> 01:49:51.551
Fuck that shit.

01:49:52.730 --> 01:49:54.823
Here you go. Pulls to the left.

01:49:56.601 --> 01:49:58.592
What the fuck, dumb-ass?

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.974
Oh, shit!

01:50:05.743 --> 01:50:12.012
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

01:50:12.083 --> 01:50:13.778
Hey, highlights, back it up.

01:50:15.219 --> 01:50:17.084
Bite my dick, asshole!

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:24.793
Ow! What the fuck you do that for?

01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:30.128
- Lance? What the fuck is going on?
- That's the son of a bitch I was looking for!

01:50:30.201 --> 01:50:33.261
Hey, guy. How'd you...

01:50:33.338 --> 01:50:36.739
- Found your computer maps, douche-bag!
- Okay.

01:50:36.808 --> 01:50:37.968
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:50:38.042 --> 01:50:40.909
Boat show,
you and your boyfriend bring it in here.

01:50:40.979 --> 01:50:42.241
I don't need no trouble right now.

01:50:42.313 --> 01:50:44.178
Let's go. Bring it in.

01:50:45.617 --> 01:50:49.314
- Bobby Jo, who the fuck is that?
- Who?

01:50:49.387 --> 01:50:52.652
- That!
- That's Felicia.

01:50:52.724 --> 01:50:54.954
She was hiding in the back seat,
no biggie.

01:50:55.026 --> 01:50:57.517
Fuck! She heard everything then.

01:50:57.595 --> 01:51:00.223
- Hello!
- Damn, you're right.

01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.224
Come on, darling.

01:51:04.302 --> 01:51:06.600
- Shut up!
- Now, take it easy on the hair.

01:51:06.671 --> 01:51:09.401
- Get down!
- Hey, hey, come on.

01:51:09.474 --> 01:51:12.341
- All right, all right.
- Take your hands off her!

01:51:24.055 --> 01:51:27.047
Stop shooting our car.
- Inconsiderate.

01:51:32.563 --> 01:51:34.554
Please! No!

01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:43.431
- All right. Get back, man.
- Ian?

01:51:43.508 --> 01:51:46.204
Everybody just be cool.

01:51:46.277 --> 01:51:48.837
- Felicia, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:51:48.913 --> 01:51:51.973
Ian, give me the goddamn gun
before you shoot your dick off.

01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:53.244
- Rex, I got this.
- Ian!

01:51:53.317 --> 01:51:57.048
God damn it, Rex, I got this!
Do not fuck with me! Not now!

01:51:57.955 --> 01:52:01.083
Ease it back, man.
That donut ain't fucking around.

01:52:02.827 --> 01:52:04.556
Hands where I can see them.

01:52:05.897 --> 01:52:10.027
- Ian, dude, you're working the mouth.
- I don't give a shit!

01:52:10.101 --> 01:52:14.231
Okay. All right, sorry.
You're doing so good. Proud of you.

01:52:14.305 --> 01:52:15.897
I mean that. I don't say it enough.

01:52:15.973 --> 01:52:19.067
- Tasty and you...
- Bobby Jo.

01:52:20.244 --> 01:52:23.907
Ian... Over there. Slowly.

01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:28.847
All right, you, corn-fed, you can
punch my friend Lance, but just once.

01:52:28.953 --> 01:52:32.150
- Dude! What the fuck?
- You nailed his girlfriend.

01:52:32.223 --> 01:52:35.351
- Not exactly. I mean, it was...
- And he came all this way.

01:52:35.426 --> 01:52:38.953
All right. All right, fair enough.
Just not in the nuts.

01:52:42.567 --> 01:52:47.800
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. Okay, all right.

01:52:49.474 --> 01:52:54.275
What a punch.
I think my kids are gonna be retarded.

01:52:54.345 --> 01:52:56.313
You got a fucking cannon for an arm, dude.

01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:01.750
- Yeah, you got a little...
- Thanks. My ears are ringing.

01:53:02.353 --> 01:53:04.218
Stop it! I'm warning you!

01:53:04.288 --> 01:53:06.882
Come on, bro. You ain't gonna kill no one.

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.552
Whoa!

01:53:12.497 --> 01:53:15.625
- Anybody can shoot a gun in the air, dude.
- I'll shoot you in the leg.

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:17.292
Suck his cock, Ian.

01:53:17.368 --> 01:53:20.166
- You serious?
- Do I look serious?

01:53:22.206 --> 01:53:24.174
I don't think you got the plums, boy.

01:53:27.745 --> 01:53:29.474
God!

01:53:34.018 --> 01:53:35.178
Oh, fuck.

01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:38.488
Okay. Okay.

01:53:40.224 --> 01:53:43.091
Anybody can shoot someone
in the leg, dude.

01:53:44.295 --> 01:53:47.594
- Give me the gun!
- Jesus, man, what do I got to do?

01:53:50.701 --> 01:53:53.602
Don't move, asshole,
or you're a fucking stain.

01:53:53.671 --> 01:53:54.797
Okay.

01:53:56.073 --> 01:53:58.064
Holy shit, Ian. Right on!

01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:01.774
Where do you think you're going, cunt?

01:54:01.846 --> 01:54:03.245
Cat fight!

01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:09.215
<i>'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

01:54:09.287 --> 01:54:10.845
Damn you, whore!

01:54:10.922 --> 01:54:12.651
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

01:54:12.723 --> 01:54:14.350
Fuck you!

01:54:16.527 --> 01:54:20.588
<i>And if I have to crawl upon the floor</i>

01:54:20.965 --> 01:54:24.457
<i>Come crashing through your door</i>

01:54:25.369 --> 01:54:30.170
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

01:54:31.242 --> 01:54:33.335
Drop the weapon, donut man!

01:54:34.779 --> 01:54:37.111
Okay, put your hands on your head!

01:54:37.181 --> 01:54:40.742
- Both hands, asshole!
- I can't move the other arm.

01:54:40.818 --> 01:54:44.515
- Who said that? Who said that?
- I can't move the other arm.

01:54:46.924 --> 01:54:50.917
Sir, I'm not resisting. It's foam, sir.

01:54:54.265 --> 01:54:58.065
The big Mexican won't go down!
Take the shot!

01:54:58.836 --> 01:55:00.497
- Holy shit.
- Jesus!

01:55:00.571 --> 01:55:03.404
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, okay?

01:55:03.507 --> 01:55:07.603
He is not the bad guy! She is the car thief.

01:55:08.346 --> 01:55:11.907
Right there. The blond, in a belt for a skirt.

01:55:19.991 --> 01:55:21.481
Anything else?

01:55:23.427 --> 01:55:26.362
Oh, yeah,
apparently there's a guy named Luis,

01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:30.196
and he has a chop shop
at 5th and Crescent!

01:55:30.268 --> 01:55:32.759
- Thanks.
- We were just banging that chick in our car.

01:55:32.837 --> 01:55:35.965
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Yeah, super hard.

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:42.070
The boy did have some plums.
He had some plums.

01:55:42.146 --> 01:55:45.309
Hey, this is Rick.
He's played arena football.

01:55:45.383 --> 01:55:47.715
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:55:47.785 --> 01:55:49.446
That's a weird little dude you got there.

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.421
Are you guys hungry?
Is this place open 24 hours?

01:55:55.159 --> 01:55:57.719
Thank you for coming for me.

01:55:58.829 --> 01:56:01.821
What were you doing in the back seat?

01:56:01.899 --> 01:56:05.096
Nothing. I was...

01:56:05.169 --> 01:56:09.128
- You were stalking me.
- No, I wasn't. I...

01:56:10.975 --> 01:56:14.411
Okay. Yeah, I was stalking you just a little.

01:56:15.913 --> 01:56:19.440
I just... I knew you were gonna do
something you were gonna regret, and I...

01:56:19.517 --> 01:56:23.681
Felicia. Why can't you just say it?

01:56:28.726 --> 01:56:32.822
- Why can't you?
- Well, I asked you first.

01:56:40.638 --> 01:56:42.333
Fine. I'll say it.

01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:52.609
- You love me.
- Fine.

01:56:54.752 --> 01:56:56.617
You love me, too, then.

01:57:01.892 --> 01:57:07.228
<i> Life is beautiful</i>

01:57:10.267 --> 01:57:13.964
<i>But it's complicated</i>

01:57:14.038 --> 01:57:15.403
Thank God.

01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:19.075
<i>We barely make it</i>

01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:34.649
You fucking heifer.

01:57:48.305 --> 01:57:49.863
- You fixed it!
- Yeah.

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:51.567
Don't lean on it.

01:57:54.011 --> 01:57:56.309
I guess you get to live.

01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:59.406
You guys are amazing.
- Thanks.

01:57:59.483 --> 01:58:01.007
Let's talk seriously for a second.

01:58:01.085 --> 01:58:06.785
I figure with the parts and labor,
you know, out the door... 4,200.

01:58:08.793 --> 01:58:09.817
Oh. Um...

01:58:09.894 --> 01:58:13.557
- It's just a round number.
- Yeah. No, I didn't really...

01:58:17.768 --> 01:58:19.065
I don't know what to...

01:58:19.136 --> 01:58:22.162
I'm fucking with you, Ian. We're good, man.

01:58:22.239 --> 01:58:26.369
- Wait, I mean, you're serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious. We're good. No worries.

01:58:26.444 --> 01:58:27.775
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

01:58:27.845 --> 01:58:28.834
- Thank you, man.
- It's what I live for,

01:58:28.913 --> 01:58:30.813
fixing other people's shit for free.

01:58:34.518 --> 01:58:35.610
Yeah.

01:58:41.292 --> 01:58:43.624
- Hey.
- Straight home, pussy!

01:58:43.694 --> 01:58:47.960
- Dude, we got to go.
- Fucking piece of shit!

01:58:48.065 --> 01:58:51.728
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna stay here, kick it Amish.

01:58:51.802 --> 01:58:53.667
Dude, what are you talking about?

01:58:53.771 --> 01:58:57.298
I don't know, a little hard work,
fresh air, missionary position.

01:58:58.142 --> 01:58:59.871
It's a man's life.

01:58:59.944 --> 01:59:01.639
- Sounds pretty good, you know.
- Yeah, it sounds...

01:59:01.712 --> 01:59:04.340
Come on, Lance. Get serious.

01:59:08.786 --> 01:59:10.185
Come here.

01:59:11.155 --> 01:59:14.022
I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.
I'm proud of you, you know.

01:59:14.091 --> 01:59:17.185
You held out for a good one,
the one you wanted.

01:59:18.028 --> 01:59:20.553
And you fucking made it happen.

01:59:21.665 --> 01:59:26.466
But, please, I'm begging you,
go take that girl to visit Grandma.

01:59:26.537 --> 01:59:28.801
- All right.
- And when you do, don't...

01:59:28.873 --> 01:59:32.070
- Lance, I got it.
- Yeah?

01:59:33.611 --> 01:59:34.703
Yeah.

01:59:36.714 --> 01:59:39.274
Okay. I think you might.

01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:41.113
- See you.
- Bye.

01:59:47.491 --> 01:59:51.018
<i> Well, no, no, me, I never worry</i>

01:59:51.729 --> 01:59:54.596
<i>Because, me, I never try</i>

01:59:54.865 --> 02:00:01.464
<i>And I never care to hold onto</i>
<i>what I just couldn't kiss goodbye</i>

02:00:19.924 --> 02:00:23.792
- Are you sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:28.660
All right, well, come on, take them off.

02:00:41.045 --> 02:00:42.444
Let's do it.

02:00:48.686 --> 02:00:50.278
Yeah!

02:00:50.354 --> 02:00:51.946
Oh, shit!

02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:54.855
What the fuck!

02:00:54.925 --> 02:00:57.189
Give me that fucking shoe...

02:00:57.261 --> 02:01:00.389
You know what? Fuck you!
I want a divorce.

02:01:00.464 --> 02:01:03.490
<i>A few weeks later,</i>
<i>I was Felicia's date to Tiffany's wedding.</i>

02:01:03.601 --> 02:01:07.037
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>it wasn't a just-friends kind of thing.</i>

02:01:09.306 --> 02:01:12.173
<i>And Rex did make my life hell for a while.</i>

02:01:12.943 --> 02:01:14.604
<i>But that Thanksgiving,</i>

02:01:14.678 --> 02:01:18.045
<i>we finally found out</i>
<i>what's been up his ass all these years.</i>

02:01:18.115 --> 02:01:22.142
I'm gay! And, so, that's it.

02:01:24.388 --> 02:01:26.982
<i>By Christmas,</i>
<i>my dad got used to the idea.</i>

02:01:27.057 --> 02:01:30.026
<i>And Rex is actually</i>
<i>a pretty great guy these days.</i>

02:01:30.094 --> 02:01:32.858
<i>Yeah, now he only uses the word faggot</i>
<i>during rough sex.</i>

02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:35.490
Karen and I want you to have this,
for Christmas.

02:01:35.566 --> 02:01:37.557
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

02:01:40.004 --> 02:01:41.301
A juicer.

02:01:41.372 --> 02:01:46.776
Oh, my gosh! That's so awesome.
Wow, I gotta get some fruit.

02:01:47.278 --> 02:01:48.336
Wow!

02:01:52.383 --> 02:01:53.850
Thank you, thank you.

02:01:54.485 --> 02:01:57.579
<i>Dylan knocked up Becca</i>
<i>and had to take my old job.</i>

02:01:59.256 --> 02:02:01.247
<i>Let's see, what else?</i>

02:02:01.892 --> 02:02:04.417
<i>Oh, Andy and Randy finally got a girlfriend.</i>

02:02:07.331 --> 02:02:10.732
<i>And on New Year's Eve,</i>
<i>Felicia and I finally visited Grandma.</i>

02:02:10.801 --> 02:02:11.859
Again?

02:02:13.137 --> 02:02:14.570
Damn, yes.

02:02:17.241 --> 02:02:19.266
- Felicia, you want to do this?
- Yes.

02:02:28.152 --> 02:02:29.915
Oh, that was awesome!

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.096
- Hey, boys. You get some rest?
- Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

02:03:14.164 --> 02:03:15.927
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

02:03:15.999 --> 02:03:18.399
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

02:03:18.469 --> 02:03:21.802
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

02:03:21.872 --> 02:03:24.272
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

02:03:24.341 --> 02:03:26.775
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

02:03:26.844 --> 02:03:29.745
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

02:03:29.813 --> 02:03:32.714
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

02:03:32.783 --> 02:03:35.911
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

02:03:35.986 --> 02:03:37.180
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

02:03:37.254 --> 02:03:42.123
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

02:03:42.192 --> 02:03:45.161
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:48.198
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

02:03:48.265 --> 02:03:50.495
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

02:03:50.567 --> 02:03:52.660
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

02:03:52.736 --> 02:03:57.002
- You guys are some strapping young lads.
- I don't know if we're really built for that.

02:03:58.442 --> 02:04:00.967
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

02:04:01.044 --> 02:04:03.444
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

02:04:03.514 --> 02:04:05.141
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

02:04:05.215 --> 02:04:06.409
I mean, that was a lot of work.

02:04:06.483 --> 02:04:08.678
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

02:04:08.752 --> 02:04:11.220
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

02:04:11.288 --> 02:04:13.518
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

02:04:13.590 --> 02:04:15.615
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

02:04:15.692 --> 02:04:18.217
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

02:04:18.295 --> 02:04:21.059
Keep him safe on the road.

02:04:21.131 --> 02:04:24.225
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

02:04:24.301 --> 02:04:25.529
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

02:04:25.602 --> 02:04:27.502
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

02:04:27.571 --> 02:04:29.505
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

02:04:29.573 --> 02:04:31.131
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

02:04:31.208 --> 02:04:34.177
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

02:04:34.244 --> 02:04:36.303
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

02:04:52.729 --> 02:04:56.665
<i>Say my name and his in the same breath</i>

02:04:56.733 --> 02:05:00.191
<i>I dare you to say they taste the same</i>

02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:03.797
<i>Let the leaves fall off in the summer</i>

02:05:03.874 --> 02:05:06.934
<i>And let December glow feel flames</i>

02:05:07.511 --> 02:05:10.605
<i>Brace myself and let go</i>

02:05:10.681 --> 02:05:14.242
<i>Start it over again in Mexico</i>

02:05:14.318 --> 02:05:18.118
<i>These friends, they don't love you</i>

02:05:18.188 --> 02:05:21.851
<i>They just love the hotel suites, now</i>

02:05:21.925 --> 02:05:24.985
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

02:05:25.062 --> 02:05:28.725
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

02:05:28.866 --> 02:05:32.029
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

02:05:32.135 --> 02:05:35.298
<i>In misery</i>

02:05:35.672 --> 02:05:39.267
<i>Said, I don't care what you think</i>

02:05:39.343 --> 02:05:43.143

02:05:43.213 --> 02:05:46.478
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:48.347
<i>In misery</i>

02:05:54.324 --> 02:05:57.919
<i>Oh, take a chance,</i>
<i>let your body get a tolerance</i>

02:05:57.995 --> 02:06:00.896
<i>I'm not a chance,</i>
<i>but a heat wave in your pants</i>

02:06:00.964 --> 02:06:03.524
<i>Pull a breath like another cigarette</i>

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.091
<i>Palms up, I'm trading 'em</i>

02:06:06.904 --> 02:06:08.735
<i>Trading 'em</i>

02:06:08.805 --> 02:06:11.933
<i>I'm the oracle in my chest</i>

02:06:12.309 --> 02:06:15.210
<i>Let the guitar scream like a fascist</i>

02:06:15.279 --> 02:06:16.974
<i>Sweat it out, shut your mouth</i>

02:06:17.047 --> 02:06:18.844
<i>Free love on the streets</i>

02:06:18.916 --> 02:06:22.943
<i>But in the alley and I ain't that cheap, now</i>

02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:26.012
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:29.991

<i>In misery</i>

02:09:01.645 --> 02:09:05.172
Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

02:09:05.248 --> 02:09:07.580
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

02:09:07.651 --> 02:09:11.212
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

02:09:11.688 --> 02:09:15.124
Well, that is gonna change today.

02:09:15.192 --> 02:09:17.092
That's right. Take a seat,

02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:19.993
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

02:09:20.063 --> 02:09:22.964
Get all ready. Looks good.

02:09:24.367 --> 02:09:25.698
Here we go.

02:09:29.439 --> 02:09:30.929
Suckers!

02:09:32.576 --> 02:09:33.873
This is serious matter.

02:09:34.978 --> 02:09:36.138
Run for your life.

02:09:36.213 --> 02:09:38.807
Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

02:09:39.983 --> 02:09:42.713
All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
- Cut.
