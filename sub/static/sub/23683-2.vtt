WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.629
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.712 --> 00:05.173
A panel of eight generals
and four admirals

00:05.256 --> 00:06.716
deemed that his actions
did not rise

00:06.800 --> 00:08.843
to the level
of a capital offense.

00:08.927 --> 00:11.388
You don't think that's a problem
for us going forward?

00:11.471 --> 00:12.764
- Is this him?
- What did she tell you?

00:12.847 --> 00:15.392
Nothing. I did not
tell him anything.

00:15.475 --> 00:17.143
She told me
you're ready to testify.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.687
Nobody's testifying.

00:18.770 --> 00:21.940
This is Brett O'Keefe. Welcome
to Day 52 of the Resistance.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.609
Easy. Easy, Mr. O'Keefe.
You're not under arrest.

00:24.693 --> 00:27.320
Now you said
put the country first.

00:27.404 --> 00:29.989
I'm offering you an opportunity
to do just that.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.449
Job, you mean?

00:31.533 --> 00:34.369
How does national security
advisor sound?

00:34.452 --> 00:38.206
You have $38,000
in credit card debt

00:38.289 --> 00:41.000
and a variety of aliases.
You don't have a job.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.128
Please, tell me you realize
we've been here before.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.506
Jesus. You know, not every shred
of nonconventional behavior

00:46.589 --> 00:49.551
boils down to an onset
of hypomania.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.054
Sorry, sir. The president
asked for bug sweeps,

00:53.138 --> 00:54.973
home and office,
all senior staff.

00:55.056 --> 00:58.226
Get the fuck out of my house.
Is that order clear?

01:20.206 --> 01:21.875
Aah!

01:35.930 --> 01:39.350
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:39.434 --> 01:40.894
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:40.977 --> 01:43.396
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:45.774 --> 01:48.985
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:49.068 --> 01:51.654
<i>You don't have my condition.</i>

01:51.738 --> 01:53.490
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:53.573 --> 01:57.118
<i>since I was 22.</i>

01:57.202 --> 02:00.705
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:00.789 --> 02:03.500
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:03.583 --> 02:07.545
<i>Civil... war.</i>

02:07.629 --> 02:09.714
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:09.798 --> 02:12.675
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:12.759 --> 02:14.469
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:14.552 --> 02:17.013
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:17.096 --> 02:22.018
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:24.145 --> 02:27.607
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:27.690 --> 02:31.277
<i>We're talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:31.361 --> 02:35.698
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:35.782 --> 02:39.661
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:39.744 --> 02:44.040
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:46.376 --> 02:48.503
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:48.586 --> 02:53.925
<i>a beacon steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

02:56.719 --> 03:01.599
An American hero died
last night.

03:01.683 --> 03:03.768
Jamie McClendon,

03:03.852 --> 03:07.188
three star general.

03:07.272 --> 03:11.860
An early casualty
in our revolution.

03:11.943 --> 03:15.738
He will not be the last.

03:15.822 --> 03:19.993
They say he died
of a heart attack,

03:20.076 --> 03:23.621
that he just keeled over
and died.

03:23.705 --> 03:27.876
Nothing could be done, okay?

03:27.959 --> 03:31.754
A heart attack.

03:31.838 --> 03:33.631
This marine's marine

03:33.715 --> 03:37.302
who went through six tours
of Afghanistan and Iraq

03:37.385 --> 03:40.221
without so much as a head cold.

03:40.305 --> 03:42.348
A heart attack.

03:42.432 --> 03:44.559
This force of nature

03:44.642 --> 03:48.021
who could outrun recruits
half his age--

03:48.104 --> 03:51.232
he just dropped dead?

03:52.650 --> 03:55.320
That's what they want us
to believe.

03:58.698 --> 04:03.036
Even though the prison guard
responsible for his safety

04:03.119 --> 04:05.538
grew up on the very same block

04:05.622 --> 04:09.125
as the president's
chief of staff.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.960
That's right,

04:11.044 --> 04:14.464
David Wellington
and that prison guard--

04:14.547 --> 04:16.633
they grew up together.

04:16.716 --> 04:21.346
But the general...
Oh, his heart just kind of...

04:23.014 --> 04:24.223
...gave out.

04:24.307 --> 04:28.061
You expect us to believe that?

04:28.144 --> 04:29.562
Really?!

04:29.646 --> 04:33.691
The president called
for his death.

04:33.775 --> 04:37.612
The tribunal said no, but this
Hitler in the White House...

04:37.695 --> 04:41.449
Oh! She will not be denied!

04:41.532 --> 04:46.120
The only way to stop
this violence against us,

04:46.204 --> 04:49.040
this violence of lies,

04:49.123 --> 04:51.501
is to fight back

04:51.584 --> 04:55.088
with a clenched fist of truth!

04:57.423 --> 04:59.550
<i>How did it happen?</i>

04:59.634 --> 05:02.929
It appears
he had a heart attack.

05:03.012 --> 05:07.016
So it's just bad luck.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.353
Brett O'Keefe says
one of the prison guards

05:10.436 --> 05:12.855
was a childhood friend
of Mr. Wellington's.

05:12.939 --> 05:15.024
Is that true?

05:15.108 --> 05:17.026
Not that we could establish.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.654
It's bullshit, obviously.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.823
That may be, but at least
O'Keefe has an explanation

05:21.906 --> 05:25.368
for what happened, which, as far
as I can tell, we do not,

05:25.451 --> 05:26.953
because even I don't believe

05:27.036 --> 05:29.747
that a decorated soldier
in perfect health

05:29.831 --> 05:31.958
suddenly drops dead
of a coronary

05:32.041 --> 05:36.879
the moment he sets foot
in federal custody.

05:36.963 --> 05:38.840
Why don't you get back to us,

05:38.923 --> 05:42.844
if and when you actually
know something?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.347
Madam President.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.898
You shouldn't listen
to O'Keefe.

05:55.982 --> 05:58.526
My listening to O'Keefe
is not the problem.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.737
Well, it is if you think
that I used someone

06:00.820 --> 06:03.656
I supposedly knew in third grade
to off McClendon.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.992
I don't think that.
They do, out there,

06:06.075 --> 06:10.121
because that is what
O'Keefe is telling them.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.166
You know what we need to do?

06:13.249 --> 06:15.168
- Change the con...
- Change the conversation.

06:15.251 --> 06:17.170
Yeah, you keep saying.

06:17.253 --> 06:19.589
Well,
I have an idea for that.

06:19.672 --> 06:23.801
It involves Saul Berenson...
and 200 others.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.219
A mass release.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.305
So they can keep
plotting against me.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.058
Most of them were
nowhere near the conspiracy.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.477
Most of them haven't been
adequately questioned yet.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.729
After two months,
that's on us.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.522
Releasing them would be
a show of good faith.

06:36.606 --> 06:39.067
How about someone shows me
some good faith?

06:39.150 --> 06:40.777
Not gonna happen.
That's the point.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.696
As long as everyone who's anyone
in this town has a friend

06:43.780 --> 06:46.616
or a colleague or a goddamn
family member behind bars,

06:46.699 --> 06:49.202
you will get no cooperation
anywhere, no traction.

06:49.285 --> 06:54.123
Things will only get worse.
Either you release them...

06:54.207 --> 06:56.751
Or what?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.087
Or what, David?

06:59.170 --> 07:00.671
Either you release them

07:00.755 --> 07:03.216
or get ready to incarcerate
the whole town,

07:03.299 --> 07:04.801
because it's not just
Brett O'Keefe

07:04.884 --> 07:08.888
gunning for you anymore.
It's everyone.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.687
That's weird.

07:16.771 --> 07:18.731
Right when I was
calling her Hitler

07:18.815 --> 07:21.192
for, like, the tenth time,
I could feel myself

07:21.275 --> 07:26.447
leave my body and float up next
to that jar of peaches there.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.575
Brett.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.203
Well, hello.

07:47.718 --> 07:51.764
Thank you! Thank you!

07:55.476 --> 07:57.061
Clenched fist of truth.

07:57.145 --> 07:58.437
I like that.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.857
So do I. That's why I stole it.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.194
My word.

08:05.278 --> 08:06.654
America.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.157
Yes, sir. And this...

08:09.240 --> 08:12.577
First battle of the Civil War,
fought right over there.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.704
Five miles
past the tree line.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.956
- Philippi.
- Philippi.

08:17.039 --> 08:20.334
Now I was taught it was
Fort Sumpter, out at the coast.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.628
This was
the first land battle.

08:22.712 --> 08:25.047
June 3, 1861.

08:25.131 --> 08:27.300
Governor of Virginia didn't
know what side he was on.

08:27.383 --> 08:30.720
It was a state of confusion
in the people.

08:30.803 --> 08:33.931
I'd say there's a lot less
confusion this time around,

08:34.015 --> 08:36.684
thanks to you.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.521
No, I-I mean it.
Show him, J.J.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.566
Come on. Show him.

08:50.656 --> 08:54.118
- Rebel!
- "Re-bel."

08:58.414 --> 08:59.916
Holy shit, it's me!

09:08.466 --> 09:11.510
I'm not utterly clueless.
I-I know.

09:11.594 --> 09:15.306
Getting my niece involved
in my... business was

09:15.389 --> 09:19.018
a huge lapse of judgment.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.688
But I-I...

09:22.772 --> 09:25.650
was running out of options,
and-and-and-and...

09:25.733 --> 09:28.319
Honestly, the whole situation
was so unique,

09:28.402 --> 09:31.906
I can basically guarantee
that won't happen again.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.284
And what is it?
This-this business.

09:35.368 --> 09:38.037
Uh, it was meeting, uh,
that needed to be relocated

09:38.120 --> 09:39.664
at the last second.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.707
And what about
the credit card debt?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.503
Was there
a segue there I missed?

09:45.586 --> 09:47.964
I'm just trying to understand
the whole picture.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.840
You have a home
with your sister.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.885
You have a place to live.
And yet, at the same time,

09:52.969 --> 09:55.638
you're checked into
at least two expensive hotels

09:55.721 --> 09:57.682
for I'm not sure what purpose.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.184
You want to explain that?

10:00.268 --> 10:02.603
Well, obviously,
you're talking to my sister.

10:02.687 --> 10:06.440
- Why not ask her?
- I have talked to her, yes.

10:06.524 --> 10:09.568
- She's concerned about you.
- About credit cards?

10:09.652 --> 10:13.489
No, not just.
She said you lost someone,

10:13.572 --> 10:18.202
that a friend of yours--
maybe your best friend--

10:18.286 --> 10:21.706
died violently
in front of your eyes.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.420
Yeah.

10:29.505 --> 10:33.801
You know what? He would have
understood what I'm doing.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.137
He never let me down, ever.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.681
He would be right here
with me now.

10:40.141 --> 10:42.268
He would have gotten it.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.812
Gotten what exactly?

10:49.066 --> 10:52.820
Our country is under attack,

10:52.987 --> 10:56.198
and I am called on...
to protect it.

10:56.282 --> 10:58.534
Not like it's something
I feel I should do,

10:58.617 --> 11:02.496
if I can find the time.
I mean, I swore an oath,

11:02.580 --> 11:04.623
just like my friend did,

11:04.707 --> 11:07.084
to do something,
to the best of my ability

11:07.168 --> 11:09.962
to help my country,
which I am doing.

11:10.046 --> 11:12.214
And what my sister fails
to comprehend...

11:12.298 --> 11:16.510
is that I'm making progress.

11:16.594 --> 11:20.389
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.475
Let me ask you.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.770
How does that sound to you,
what you just said?

11:27.772 --> 11:29.815
It sounds true.

11:29.899 --> 11:32.443
And?

11:32.526 --> 11:37.782
And I'm taking my medication,
if that's what you're asking.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.492
- I take it every day.
- Lithium?

11:39.575 --> 11:43.204
That's been your principal
therapy for 15 years now, right?

11:43.287 --> 11:46.749
- Prescribed by your sister.
- Originally.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.044
Are you aware that

11:50.127 --> 11:52.380
in a small part
of the population,

11:52.463 --> 11:55.674
lithium can become ineffective
after that much time?

11:57.009 --> 11:59.929
It simply stops working.

12:16.153 --> 12:20.658
Good news. The president
has accepted your terms.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.701
She's agreed to release you,
along with the 200 others,

12:22.785 --> 12:24.537
just like you asked,

12:24.620 --> 12:28.165
provided you accept a position
in her administration--

12:28.249 --> 12:30.167
national security advisor.

12:30.251 --> 12:32.378
Can I ask why
the sudden shift?

12:33.963 --> 12:36.090
President had
a change of heart.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.679
Was this before or after
General McClendon died?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.848
Does it matter?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.558
Yeah, David, it matters.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.353
Because if my new position
is really shit screen

12:49.437 --> 12:52.189
for the administration,
I'm not interested.

12:52.273 --> 12:55.651
You'd rather have 200 people
sitting in jail?

12:55.734 --> 12:56.986
Yeah.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.950
First, I don't think that you
or anyone actually believes

13:03.033 --> 13:04.869
that the president
of the United States

13:04.952 --> 13:07.538
had a general offed in prison.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.709
Second, no one's expecting you
to pick up pom-poms

13:11.792 --> 13:13.878
and become some kind of
cheerleader.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.880
- Good.
- But...

13:15.963 --> 13:18.674
no carping
from the sidelines, either.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.927
No press leaks undermining
the president's statements.

13:25.306 --> 13:27.141
We want...

13:27.224 --> 13:28.601
a partner.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.562
We want to leave
the mess behind

13:31.645 --> 13:34.815
and move
the country forward.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.736
When does this happen?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.780
This, uh, moving.

13:43.491 --> 13:45.326
Soon as you say yes.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.001
Madam President.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.378
- You know your lines?
- Think so.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.631
"Time to move on."

15:22.715 --> 15:24.842
That's what my advisors say.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.344
Thank you.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.641
But realistically?

15:32.725 --> 15:36.895
The national security
establishment came after me

15:36.979 --> 15:38.856
with machine guns
as far as I can see

15:38.939 --> 15:42.735
for no other reason than that
they felt disrespected.

15:46.405 --> 15:51.160
I doubt I'll ever get over it.
I'm not even sure I should.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.746
It was a very small group,
Madam President.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.206
- You're sure about that.
- Yes.

15:56.290 --> 15:59.001
And it never included me.

15:59.084 --> 16:03.589
I was there that day with you,
in the lead vehicle.

16:03.672 --> 16:06.717
My driver was killed
in the explosion.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.010
The doctors
spent three hours

16:08.093 --> 16:10.596
pulling broken glass
out of my face.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.224
I was on your side.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.728
I hope so.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.523
They're ready.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.046
Sorry. Got to deal with this.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.965
<i>- Hello?</i>
- What is this?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.675
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

17:29.758 --> 17:31.593
She's-she's got some connection
to Wellington.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.178
<i>A colleague, maybe?
A secret girlfriend?</i>

17:33.262 --> 17:35.013
I meant,
what the fuck are you doing,

17:35.097 --> 17:36.724
<i>calling me?</i>

17:36.807 --> 17:38.142
Look, I don't need you to do
anything except I.D. her.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.685
Do that, and-and I'll take care
of the rest.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.562
I-I know you're under
a microscope there.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.230
Look, what about
our last encounter suggested

17:43.313 --> 17:44.898
I ever wanted to hear
from you again?

17:44.982 --> 17:46.692
I just need you to I.D. her.
It's important.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.571
- I'm on my own here.
- And why do you think that is?

17:50.654 --> 17:52.406
Look, I...

17:54.575 --> 17:57.077
Hello?

17:57.161 --> 18:00.164
Dante? Are you there?

18:06.462 --> 18:08.464
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.133
Sorry.
I-I-I wasn't snooping.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.843
I came up
because there's something

18:12.926 --> 18:14.762
I think you'll want to see.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.976
What began as an investigation
into a violent conspiracy

18:21.059 --> 18:23.437
against the heart
of our government

18:23.520 --> 18:28.358
has become a source
of such acrimony and division

18:28.442 --> 18:32.196
that I've decided,
in the interest of this country,

18:32.279 --> 18:35.908
it is time to put it behind us.

18:35.991 --> 18:40.245
A group that has come
to be known as "The Two Hundred"

18:40.329 --> 18:43.123
is being released today
as we speak.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.711
Among those released today,

18:47.795 --> 18:49.505
is Saul Berenson,

18:49.588 --> 18:52.841
my new
national security advisor.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.515
<i>Thank you, Madam President...</i>

18:59.598 --> 19:01.517
Mommy, Uncle Saul's on TV!

19:01.600 --> 19:04.645
<i>...for this... great honor.</i>

19:04.728 --> 19:07.314
<i>We cannot let recent events</i>

19:07.397 --> 19:10.275
<i>derail the work of this nation.</i>

19:10.359 --> 19:12.152
<i>We are still one nation.</i>

19:12.236 --> 19:14.112
What is this?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.614
Her new
national security advisor.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.450
Saul?

19:18.534 --> 19:20.702
It's what you wanted,
isn't it? He's out.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.371
<i>And while we squabble,
they gain ground.</i>

19:22.454 --> 19:25.457
<i>While we attack
our own government,</i>

19:25.541 --> 19:26.875
<i>they revel in their good luck.</i>

19:26.959 --> 19:28.627
I don't get it.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.379
What's to get?

19:30.462 --> 19:32.923
Um, why he's joining <i>them.</i>

19:33.006 --> 19:34.633
Well, for one thing,

19:34.716 --> 19:36.802
because those 200 people
you've been obsessing about,

19:36.885 --> 19:38.387
the political prisoners,
so-called,

19:38.470 --> 19:41.765
- they're being released.
- What?

19:41.849 --> 19:44.810
Released. All of them.
So... you were wrong.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.520
The president
is not a dictator.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.855
The world is not coming
to an end.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.606
Shh. I want to hear this.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.733
By the end of the day,
they will all be released--

19:51.817 --> 19:53.694
an event that you swore wouldn't
occur during in our lifetimes.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.863
Let's see
if it actually happens.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.115
- Most of them are already out.
- They never

19:58.198 --> 19:59.616
should've been <i>in,</i>
in the first place.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.411
You never admit
you're wrong, do you?

20:04.162 --> 20:08.208
What the mass release
shows is that the system works.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.213
- Yes?
- What about
your own incarceration?

20:13.297 --> 20:15.132
Are you saying now
that it was justified?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.634
What's important is not that
I was in, but that I'm out,

20:17.718 --> 20:19.887
standing in front of you.
It's testimony

20:19.970 --> 20:23.557
to the open-mindedness
of this administration...

20:23.640 --> 20:25.183
Have you told him?

20:25.267 --> 20:28.020
Not yet. Wanted to see
how he did on this first.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.147
...to addressing
the many security challenges

20:30.230 --> 20:32.274
this country is facing
around the world.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.734
Yes, sir?

20:33.817 --> 20:35.319
What will be your first order
of business?

20:35.402 --> 20:38.697
Finding my office. Thank you.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.369
Well,
they didn't lynch me.

20:44.453 --> 20:47.664
You did well. Thank you.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.292
So? What next?

20:50.375 --> 20:53.712
David will get you started.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.213
What's that mean?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.049
It's what the reporter
was asking,

20:57.132 --> 20:58.592
your first order of business.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.928
I have some thoughts on that.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.554
Well, so does the president.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.807
She feels it's important
to send the right message,

21:05.891 --> 21:08.226
- to the country.
- What sort of message?

21:08.310 --> 21:11.521
Well, we have a very troubling
national security situation

21:11.605 --> 21:13.774
that's grown more and more
out of control.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.359
What has?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.778
O'Keefe.

21:21.490 --> 21:23.867
Okay, wait.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.453
- We just announced an amnesty.
- Not for him.

21:26.536 --> 21:29.539
He was working directly
with Dar Adal.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.625
So was I. You just made me
national security advisor.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.919
Saul, he's been thumbing
his nose at an arrest warrant

21:34.002 --> 21:37.422
for six weeks, calling for
the overthrow of the government.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.383
The president's questioning
the FBI's commitment

21:39.466 --> 21:43.095
to bring him in at all.
It has to stop.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.682
Since when is domestic police
work in my job description?

21:46.765 --> 21:49.434
We see this
as hunting a terrorist.

21:49.518 --> 21:52.145
President trusts you.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.356
She wants you in charge.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.654
Good night, beautiful girl.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.739
Mmm. Sleep tight.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.661
- You okay?
- I like it here.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.413
So do I.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.540
Then why are you mad
all the time?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.417
Hmm?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.377
Like yelling at Uncle Bill.

22:17.796 --> 22:22.342
Oh, I wasn't yelling, sweetie.
We just... disagreed.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.720
You always disagree.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.266
I'll try to be nicer.
Okay?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.059
I don't want to have
to leave here.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.270
I don't know where we'd go.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.147
Oh, sweetheart,

22:35.230 --> 22:37.858
is that what you're worried
about, where we'd go?

22:39.901 --> 22:41.653
Listen to me.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.656
This is our family,
yours and mine.

22:44.740 --> 22:49.494
We don't have to go anywhere.
All right?

22:51.038 --> 22:53.165
I love you, Franny Banany.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.500
Mmm.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.587
Now get some sleep.
Night.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.924
- Mommy! Help!
- Oh!

25:49.007 --> 25:51.426
Oh, sweetie,
you missed a button.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.803
Here.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.349
What's wrong?

25:57.432 --> 26:00.018
Uh, nothing. Why don't you, uh,
go start your breakfast?

26:00.101 --> 26:02.520
I'll be down in
a second, okay? Okay.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.876
Carrie?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.587
Carrie, can you please
come down?

26:40.016 --> 26:43.144
- Hey. What's going on?
- My meeting

26:43.228 --> 26:44.604
got moved an hour earlier,

26:44.688 --> 26:46.564
so can you take the girls
to school?

26:46.648 --> 26:50.110
- I can do it.
- No. So, Carrie?

26:50.193 --> 26:53.863
Um... I wish I could,
but I-I have an interview.

26:53.947 --> 26:56.908
- Drop them on the way.
- I can do it.

26:56.992 --> 26:58.410
No.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.079
It's on Skype,
in about ten minutes.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.706
Looking like that?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.874
Um, I-I'm about to change.
I'm sorry.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.460
So I either reschedule
my meeting again,

27:07.544 --> 27:09.587
or I take her right now.
She ready?

27:09.671 --> 27:11.548
Uh, yeah. Yeah, she's ready.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.967
Okay, Franny.
Let's go, sweetie.

27:15.552 --> 27:17.762
Have a good day at school.
All right, munchkin?

27:17.846 --> 27:21.266
- Mwah. Love you.
- Good luck.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.643
The interview.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.729
Yeah, thanks. And thanks.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.647
Yeah.
Come on, girls, let's go.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.542
Fuck!

27:58.970 --> 28:01.097
No better feeling,
is there?

28:01.181 --> 28:04.517
Exercising
your constitutional rights.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.312
- You want to try?
- I'm good.

28:07.395 --> 28:08.688
You're gonna want to.

28:08.772 --> 28:12.400
Uncle Dan--
he's got a surprise.

28:18.406 --> 28:21.117
- That is hilarious!
- I told you you'd want to.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.914
Well, why the hell not?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.920
You know what people forget?

28:32.003 --> 28:35.465
The Second Amendment isn't
about needing guns for hunting

28:35.548 --> 28:38.009
or-or target shootin'
or security.

28:38.093 --> 28:41.346
No, sir. It's about
resisting tyranny.

28:41.429 --> 28:44.224
The Founding Fathers,
in their infinite wisdom,

28:44.307 --> 28:46.851
foresaw the dark day

28:46.935 --> 28:49.562
when we would face
a president like Keane,

28:49.646 --> 28:52.982
as deadly
as any foreign king.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.652
And we would have to fight
for our lives and liberty

28:55.735 --> 28:58.154
all over again.

29:06.079 --> 29:09.374
Are you okay?

29:11.543 --> 29:13.795
Did I hit her?

29:16.047 --> 29:18.550
It was a frame grab
off the surveillance cams.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.051
Some guy on 4chan said
he recognized her,

29:20.135 --> 29:22.762
had another photo.
I clicked without thinking.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.348
So incredibly stupid.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.600
Lately, I don't know.
It's just been one

29:27.684 --> 29:29.811
fucking thing after another.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.274
Well?

29:34.357 --> 29:36.860
Your keyboard's locked, and all
your files are encrypted.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.320
Yeah, no, I got that.
But how bad is it?

29:39.404 --> 29:43.616
It's bad. The malware uses
elliptic curve encryption.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.453
But you can fix it, right?

29:46.536 --> 29:48.830
No.

29:48.913 --> 29:51.708
- You can fix anything.
- Not this.

29:51.791 --> 29:55.336
Nobody has been able
to crack this, not yet anyway.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.839
Well,
what am I supposed to do?

29:57.922 --> 29:59.674
You know I can't go
to the police.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.010
What's on that hard drive could
put us both in prison.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.012
There's only one option.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.722
What?

30:05.805 --> 30:08.349
You have to pay the ransom.

30:11.436 --> 30:15.315
I'm broke, Max.
I'm-I'm worse than broke.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.358
Borrow money
from your sister.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.527
I can't. I'm already
on thin ice with her.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.239
I can loan you $753.

30:23.323 --> 30:26.493
But, look, Carrie, you really

30:26.576 --> 30:29.496
don't have any other choice.
You have to pay it.

30:29.579 --> 30:31.164
<i>The loser's right.</i>

30:35.877 --> 30:39.255
<i>And... the price just doubled.</i>

30:39.339 --> 30:41.591
<i>It's now ten grand.</i>

30:45.428 --> 30:47.931
<i>Tell the loser to leave.</i>

30:48.014 --> 30:51.309
<i>Leave, Max,</i>

30:51.392 --> 30:53.895
<i>or the price doubles again.</i>

31:03.988 --> 31:05.532
Okay. He's gone.

31:05.615 --> 31:08.117
<i>- Just you and me then.</i>
- What do you want?

31:08.201 --> 31:10.578
<i>Oh, I'd say
it's pretty obvious.</i>

31:10.662 --> 31:13.081
Well, if you've seen
my bank statements,

31:13.164 --> 31:15.500
you know I'm overdrawn
on every single account.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.752
<i>You're white,
college-educated,</i>

31:17.835 --> 31:21.172
<i>living in America.
You'll figure something out.</i>

31:21.256 --> 31:23.341
<i>And you've got 24 hours.</i>

31:23.424 --> 31:25.426
At least give me
until next week.

31:25.510 --> 31:26.844
<i>No. No extensions.</i>

31:26.928 --> 31:29.347
- Please.
<i>- If you're not ready</i>

31:29.430 --> 31:32.225
<i>to transfer $10,000 in Bitcoin
tomorrow at this time,</i>

31:32.308 --> 31:36.563
<i>I'm publishing the contents
of your hard drive online.</i>

31:36.646 --> 31:41.276
<i>Make for some very interesting
reading, don't you think?</i>

31:41.359 --> 31:43.444
<i>Hmm? See ya.</i>

31:43.528 --> 31:46.447
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no! Come back!

31:48.366 --> 31:49.534
Fuck!

31:52.954 --> 31:55.665
Hello?

31:55.748 --> 31:57.834
Yeah, hold on.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.878
- Paley's here.
- About fucking time.

32:00.962 --> 32:04.424
- Are you sure about this?
- Positive.

32:04.507 --> 32:06.217
Send him in.

32:11.139 --> 32:13.391
Madam President.

32:13.474 --> 32:14.684
- David.
- Thanks for coming in, Sam.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.352
Of course.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.646
How about we start with
your home state, Senator?

32:18.730 --> 32:21.149
You want to tell me
what exactly's going on?

32:21.232 --> 32:24.652
Happy to. It's all hype,
Madam President.

32:24.736 --> 32:25.945
Oh, I don't think so.

32:26.029 --> 32:28.489
You've got armed civilians
patrolling the border.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.742
They're harmless. Yahoos.

32:30.825 --> 32:32.493
In open violation of
a U.S. District Court Order.

32:32.577 --> 32:35.747
Believe me, Arizona Border ReCon

32:35.830 --> 32:37.665
isn't about to lead a revolt

32:37.749 --> 32:39.208
on the federal government.

32:39.292 --> 32:42.295
Well, it doesn't help

32:42.378 --> 32:44.505
that you're all over
the local media down there,

32:44.589 --> 32:47.592
calling me un-American,
weak on national defense,

32:47.675 --> 32:50.803
warning me not to visit
anytime soon.

32:52.555 --> 32:56.017
"I'm afraid we can no longer
guarantee her safety."

32:56.100 --> 33:00.396
Well...
maybe I did get a little...

33:00.480 --> 33:03.107
- carried away there.
- No shit.

33:03.191 --> 33:05.902
Why don't we all sit down?

33:05.985 --> 33:07.403
No, let's not, David.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.364
The senator won't be
staying long.

33:10.615 --> 33:11.991
Not unless he's willing
to shut down

33:12.075 --> 33:13.993
his committee's investigation.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.828
Excuse me?

33:15.912 --> 33:17.997
As of this morning,
everybody swept up

33:18.081 --> 33:20.500
in the second wave of arrests
has been released.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.210
Most are back at work
already.

33:22.293 --> 33:24.170
Releasing them
doesn't change the fact

33:24.253 --> 33:26.464
that they were
unlawfully detained.

33:26.547 --> 33:29.175
And that's not
the only sin of commission.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.010
What are you talking about?

33:31.094 --> 33:32.428
There's the very strange timing

33:32.512 --> 33:34.263
of General McClendon's
heart attack...

33:34.347 --> 33:36.432
- You're not serious.
- ...coming, as it did,

33:36.516 --> 33:38.685
right on the heels
of your very unusual

33:38.768 --> 33:40.311
appeal for the death penalty.

33:40.395 --> 33:43.398
You're not gonna dignify
that nonsense with hearings?

33:43.481 --> 33:48.069
I have a sworn duty,
Madam President, just like you.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.571
Like hell you do.

33:50.655 --> 33:53.741
We can ask nicely, Senator,

33:53.825 --> 33:55.785
or we can go to war

33:55.868 --> 33:57.829
with you next November.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.373
Next November, huh?

34:00.456 --> 34:04.377
Arizona's going
majority-minority any day now,

34:04.460 --> 34:06.754
and our polling indicates
that you're 50-50

34:06.838 --> 34:08.965
to lose your seat
as it is.

34:09.048 --> 34:12.969
The White House weighs in,
all our resources,

34:13.052 --> 34:15.304
you're toast.

34:16.556 --> 34:19.016
You think so?

34:19.100 --> 34:21.227
I know so.

34:21.310 --> 34:25.481
Honestly, come next November,

34:25.565 --> 34:28.776
I don't think I'm the one
out of a job.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.196
Madam President.

35:21.913 --> 35:23.664
Hello?

35:25.625 --> 35:28.461
I'm here. I...

35:28.544 --> 35:30.004
I want to talk.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.672
Fuck.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.174
Hello?

35:35.259 --> 35:36.844
Hello?

35:36.928 --> 35:40.014
Hey, what the hell?
Since when is it 20 grand?

35:40.097 --> 35:41.849
What is going on?

35:43.392 --> 35:45.061
Hey! Hey, are you there?

35:45.144 --> 35:46.896
<i>Yeah. I'm here.</i>

35:46.979 --> 35:50.817
I had until tomorrow. You-you
can't keep changing the terms.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.401
<i>No, that's the beauty of it.
I can do whatever I want.</i>

35:52.485 --> 35:55.488
- No, it's not fair.
<i>- Oh, boo fucking hoo.</i>

35:57.573 --> 36:01.077
Seriously, 20 grand is
too much to ask.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.997
<i>I'm not sure the president's
chief of staff would agree.</i>

36:06.374 --> 36:08.459
<i>What did he do?</i>

36:08.543 --> 36:12.588
<i>Did he dump you or something?
Break your heart?</i>

36:12.672 --> 36:14.632
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:14.715 --> 36:18.094
<i>Don't play dumb.
You're a freak. You got cameras</i>

36:18.177 --> 36:20.304
<i>all over his house,
in his bedroom.</i>

36:20.388 --> 36:23.641
<i>Bet you were hoping
I didn't notice, huh?</i>

36:23.724 --> 36:26.978
<i>It's too bad you and the loser
let it slip.</i>

36:27.061 --> 36:30.273
<i>And now you're gonna be
my golden goose.</i>

36:34.735 --> 36:37.947
<i>What the hell is so funny?</i>

36:38.030 --> 36:39.699
- Go ahead.
<i>- Go ahead what?</i>

36:39.782 --> 36:42.034
Well, tell him.
I don't give a shit.

36:42.118 --> 36:45.288
<i>Don't think I won't.</i>

36:45.371 --> 36:46.914
He knows already.

36:46.998 --> 36:50.251
How else do you think
I got the cameras in there?

36:50.334 --> 36:53.379
He gets off on it,
me watching him.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.381
<i>You're lying.</i>

36:55.464 --> 36:57.592
I'm not.

36:57.675 --> 37:00.136
David Wellington likes to party.
Google him sometime.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.679
Do it now.

37:03.431 --> 37:05.308
Five years ago,
NYPD Vice busted him

37:05.391 --> 37:07.685
with a couple of escorts
in a suite at the Waldorf.

37:07.768 --> 37:10.229
Photos got out online.
It ended his career.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.610
Well?

37:18.112 --> 37:19.405
You believe me now?

37:19.488 --> 37:22.867
<i>Maybe.</i>

37:22.950 --> 37:25.828
<i>Doesn't change the fact
I still own your hard drive.</i>

37:29.457 --> 37:33.336
Doesn't change the fact

37:33.419 --> 37:36.172
that I still can't afford
to pay you.

37:55.608 --> 37:58.319
<i>You seeing this?</i>

37:58.402 --> 38:00.404
Yeah.

38:03.366 --> 38:06.577
<i>So what if I'm a freak?</i>

38:06.661 --> 38:09.413
What do you mean?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.752
You interested?

38:14.835 --> 38:17.254
<i>What have you got in mind?</i>

38:17.338 --> 38:21.008
I don't know.

38:21.092 --> 38:25.221
An exchange of services?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.306
Like what?

38:29.266 --> 38:32.311
<i>Anything you want.</i>

38:32.395 --> 38:34.355
I want...

38:34.438 --> 38:36.399
you to take off your shirt.

38:38.651 --> 38:42.238
Not now. Later, in person.

38:42.321 --> 38:46.117
<i>I said,
take off your fucking shirt!</i>

39:07.471 --> 39:10.433
<i>Now sit back. I want to see.</i>

39:13.102 --> 39:16.397
<i>Take off your bra, too.</i>

39:23.362 --> 39:23.862
Okay.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.785
Now play with your titties.

39:33.205 --> 39:37.334
<i>Use both hands.</i>

39:45.551 --> 39:49.013
Now... roll your nipples.

39:49.096 --> 39:51.098
Make 'em long and full.

39:52.725 --> 39:56.062
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

39:57.646 --> 40:00.149
<i>Hey, what are you doing?
Don't stop!</i>

40:00.232 --> 40:01.609
It's not for free, asshole.

40:01.692 --> 40:03.027
You want more,
it has to be in person.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.029
And you have to unlock
my computer.

41:02.211 --> 41:06.465
Fuck you, Feds!

41:24.483 --> 41:26.485
Berenson.

41:26.569 --> 41:29.029
Special Agent in Charge
Sean Maslin.

41:29.113 --> 41:30.823
I hear
you were close this time.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.450
Yeah. They got word we were
coming, snuck him out.

41:33.534 --> 41:36.120
- Who's "they"?
- Local law enforcement.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.831
- They say where they took him?
- No, not yet.

41:40.708 --> 41:42.459
What happened to his face?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.795
Resisting arrest.

41:44.879 --> 41:47.923
Refused to accept that
my agents had jurisdiction.

41:48.007 --> 41:50.593
Honestly, the shit we have
to wade through down here.

41:53.387 --> 41:55.806
I want to talk to 'em.

41:55.890 --> 41:58.934
- Okay.
- On my own.

41:59.018 --> 42:02.313
Uncuff 'em,
get 'em something to drink.

42:02.396 --> 42:04.190
Split 'em up.

42:10.571 --> 42:13.490
- Ouch! Careful.
- You're so full of shit.

42:13.574 --> 42:15.075
The great defender
of the Second Amendment

42:15.159 --> 42:17.578
never fired a gun
in his life.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.205
- I have.
- You're such a liar.

42:19.288 --> 42:21.999
I did. Summer camp,
40 years ago.

42:22.082 --> 42:25.002
Hold this.
I'm gonna ask one of the guys

42:25.085 --> 42:28.130
to drive me to town today.
There's a bus station there,

42:28.214 --> 42:29.965
and I'll show you how to log on
for the broadcast.

42:30.049 --> 42:31.383
It's not that complicated.

42:31.467 --> 42:33.177
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

42:33.260 --> 42:35.012
You said you wanted a bed,
which you got,

42:35.095 --> 42:37.890
and clean clothes and a shower,
which you also got.

42:37.973 --> 42:41.852
- You look great, actually.
- Stop. I told you, I'm done.

42:41.936 --> 42:43.896
- I need to go home.
- To what?

42:43.979 --> 42:45.648
My life.

42:45.731 --> 42:48.025
You'd trade all this for
a studio apartment in Brooklyn?

42:48.108 --> 42:50.486
Yeah. I don't like
being surrounded

42:50.569 --> 42:53.530
- by gun-toting crazies.
- That's why you got to stay,

42:53.614 --> 42:56.033
protect me
from the lunatic fringe.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.580
Uh, Dad says food's ready.

43:01.664 --> 43:05.334
Thanks, J.J.
We'll be right there.

43:07.795 --> 43:11.465
Hey, J.J.! Hold on.

43:11.548 --> 43:15.010
J.J.! You...
you heard us talkin'.

43:15.094 --> 43:17.680
- It's none of my business.
- Oh, it is your business.

43:17.763 --> 43:20.349
I've been on the run
for nearly 60 days,

43:20.432 --> 43:23.143
and the only reason the Feds
haven't caught up with me

43:23.227 --> 43:27.273
is because of the courage and
kindness of families like yours.

43:27.356 --> 43:29.024
I was having trouble in there

43:29.108 --> 43:30.943
with the world's worst
girlfriend,

43:31.026 --> 43:33.362
and I said something
I'm not proud of.

43:33.445 --> 43:36.532
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

43:36.615 --> 43:39.994
I ask your forgiveness.

43:43.080 --> 43:47.126
Do you...
think we're crazy?

43:50.087 --> 43:52.881
Anyone who stands up
for what they believe,

43:52.965 --> 43:55.092
people are gonna say
they're crazy.

43:55.175 --> 43:57.970
They've been calling me that
for years.

43:58.053 --> 44:00.556
But what you and your daddy
have made here

44:00.639 --> 44:04.101
is the very opposite
of crazy.

44:04.184 --> 44:06.812
It's blessed.

44:06.895 --> 44:09.148
I'm proud to be fightin'
on your side.

44:25.956 --> 44:28.792
I was speaking
to your colleague.

44:28.876 --> 44:30.794
It was interesting.

44:30.878 --> 44:34.089
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

44:34.173 --> 44:36.967
Split us up, tell him
one thing, tell me another.

44:37.051 --> 44:38.427
I'm a cop,
you fucking moron.

44:38.510 --> 44:40.929
It was interesting

44:41.013 --> 44:45.351
because I couldn't
find the words to express...

44:49.563 --> 44:52.232
...to express the dismay I feel

44:52.316 --> 44:54.860
at what I saw outside.

44:54.943 --> 44:58.655
Hundred people,
ordinary decent citizens,

44:58.739 --> 45:02.701
staring at the FBI
with hatred in their eyes

45:02.785 --> 45:05.412
like they're
an occupying army.

45:05.496 --> 45:06.872
Aren't they?

45:06.955 --> 45:09.625
You know where
I've seen this before?

45:11.293 --> 45:15.172
Some of the most fucked-up
places on the planet,

45:15.255 --> 45:17.591
places we're so proud
we're not.

45:18.675 --> 45:22.721
Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria.

45:22.805 --> 45:25.057
Locals...

45:25.140 --> 45:27.976
facing the armies
of governments they hate.

45:30.270 --> 45:34.316
All it takes is one wrong word,
one wrong move,

45:34.400 --> 45:37.152
and people start dying.

45:37.236 --> 45:40.197
Get the Feds to leave,
the folks will go home.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.242
The FBI won't leave
without O'Keefe.

45:43.325 --> 45:45.494
Then you got a problem.

45:45.577 --> 45:47.162
No, you got a problem.
That's what I'm saying.

45:47.246 --> 45:49.540
These are your people,
people you swore to protect.

45:49.623 --> 45:53.043
You're leaving them out there
in harm's way.

45:56.588 --> 46:00.467
I know Brett O'Keefe.
He knows me.

46:02.594 --> 46:04.054
Tell me where you took him.

46:06.014 --> 46:09.726
I'll go talk to him.

46:09.810 --> 46:11.353
Alone.

46:13.063 --> 46:15.566
I will end this.

46:15.649 --> 46:18.610
No one will get hurt.

46:18.694 --> 46:20.320
You have my word.

46:48.807 --> 46:51.518
I'm on Demoines. Parked.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.061
<i>Get out.</i>

46:53.145 --> 46:55.856
<i>Walk back in the direction
you came.</i>

46:55.939 --> 46:58.525
Where are you?

46:58.609 --> 47:00.694
<i>Start walking.</i>

47:07.784 --> 47:10.621
<i>Leave the bag.</i>

47:10.704 --> 47:12.331
<i>Leave it.</i>

47:16.627 --> 47:18.795
<i>And the jacket.</i>

47:18.879 --> 47:21.340
<i>The jacket.</i>

47:54.331 --> 47:57.167
- I know where O'Keefe is.
- Fantastic. All right, listen,

47:57.251 --> 47:58.919
get Hammett in here.
I want to be in the room--

47:59.002 --> 48:01.755
I am going to talk to him
on my own.

48:01.838 --> 48:04.132
- He's a federal fugitive.
- I'm aware.

48:04.216 --> 48:05.676
Yeah? And you think, what,

48:05.759 --> 48:08.011
he'll just turn himself in
without a fight?

48:08.095 --> 48:10.430
Look, I'm not letting you make
the same mess you made here--

48:10.514 --> 48:12.849
pissing off the locals, beating
up a cop, for fuck's sake?

48:12.933 --> 48:15.018
One call to the Director,
you're off the case.

48:17.312 --> 48:19.189
We go together...

48:19.273 --> 48:22.818
then it's O'Keefe and me.
Agreed?

48:35.289 --> 48:37.082
<i>On your right.</i>

48:37.165 --> 48:38.709
It's the green door.

48:46.925 --> 48:49.303
It's open.

48:58.145 --> 49:00.439
<i>Go left.</i>

49:08.947 --> 49:10.991
Keep moving.

49:16.622 --> 49:18.582
<i>Open it.</i>

49:32.471 --> 49:34.181
<i>Go left.</i>

49:50.947 --> 49:52.908
<i>Past the tables.</i>

50:00.374 --> 50:02.626
<i>Keep walking.</i>

50:13.887 --> 50:16.390
<i>Stop.</i>

50:21.561 --> 50:23.980
<i>Don't need the phone anymore.</i>

50:24.064 --> 50:27.067
Put it down.

50:38.954 --> 50:42.040
Where are you?

50:42.124 --> 50:45.544
- Okay, now you're scaring me.
- Stop talking.

51:00.267 --> 51:02.102
Take off your shirt.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.480
First unlock my computer.

51:05.564 --> 51:08.024
Take it off.

51:10.068 --> 51:12.070
You said you would
unlock my computer.

51:12.154 --> 51:14.948
Why the fuck do you think
you're here?

51:17.075 --> 51:18.744
Take it off.

51:20.036 --> 51:24.332
Do it now,
or I walk out of here

51:24.416 --> 51:27.085
and I start fucking up
your life.

51:37.763 --> 51:40.766
Come on. <i>Come on.</i>

51:41.933 --> 51:43.602
It's stuck.

51:50.066 --> 51:51.610
Turn around.

52:39.366 --> 52:40.909
Aah!

52:40.992 --> 52:43.912
- You fuck!
- Aah!

52:48.124 --> 52:49.876
Aah!

52:55.006 --> 52:58.718
All right.

52:58.802 --> 53:00.887
All right?

53:02.264 --> 53:05.851
No! Aah! Aah!

53:14.818 --> 53:16.278
Unlock my computer.

53:23.994 --> 53:25.328
- Aah!
- Unlock my computer,

53:25.412 --> 53:28.039
- or I will fucking kill you.
- Aah!

53:28.123 --> 53:30.208
Okay! It hurts!

53:30.292 --> 53:32.085
I don't give a shit. Do it.

53:42.429 --> 53:44.014
Keep fucking typing.

53:52.230 --> 53:55.525
It's done.

53:55.609 --> 53:57.944
Yeah?

53:59.696 --> 54:02.908
I swear.

54:07.329 --> 54:10.540
Please.
Please, let me go.

54:10.624 --> 54:14.127
Like you let me go?

54:14.210 --> 54:16.671
Aah!

54:16.755 --> 54:18.506
I'm CIA, you motherfucker.

54:18.590 --> 54:20.884
You try anything, I will
hunt you down. I will kill you.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.886
I know who you are...

54:22.969 --> 54:24.429
...where you live.
I've got your prints,

54:24.512 --> 54:26.640
your DNA,
your ugly fucking face.

54:26.723 --> 54:29.184
I've got you for the rest
of your life. Do you hear?
