00:39.140 --> 00:40.440
- Let's go.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.047
<i>So you want to talk about
the hall of fame?</i>

00:47.049 --> 00:48.448
<i>Let's do it.
Yeah.</i>

00:48.450 --> 00:51.418
I think you will find that most
rock journalists

00:51.420 --> 00:53.453
Have a room like this
in their house.

00:53.455 --> 00:56.222
Come this way.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.457
You know, I know some people
are upset

00:57.459 --> 00:59.125
About how the blue jean
committee

00:59.127 --> 01:00.493
Are getting inducted into
the hall of fame,

01:00.495 --> 01:03.129
Even though they only made
one great album.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.135
Here's a room where vinyl lives.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.737
Let's find the copy
of "catalina breeze."

01:10.739 --> 01:12.605
<i>I spent a couple weeks with
them in 1974.</i>

01:12.607 --> 01:16.676
<i>I was there.
I saw the magic happening.</i>

01:16.678 --> 01:19.579
Aha.

01:19.581 --> 01:21.281
The blue jean committee.

01:21.283 --> 01:25.418
Here's the original edition,
first pressing.

01:25.420 --> 01:27.620
Clark and gene,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:27.622 --> 01:29.856
If you listen to the records,
you know about clark's voice,

01:29.858 --> 01:34.761
But what you aren't prepared for
is if you see them live in 1974,

01:34.763 --> 01:38.398
What happens when he busts
that voice out live.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.334
It is a fuse that gets lit,
and the whole place goes off.

01:41.336 --> 01:43.603
And I--I just remember as a
young journalist, seeing this,

01:43.605 --> 01:46.673
And going, you know,
"holy shit.

01:46.675 --> 01:48.641
"hold onto this moment.
This is magic.

01:48.643 --> 01:52.212
These guys could change
history."

01:52.214 --> 01:54.314
<i>And those were amazing shows.</i>

01:54.316 --> 01:55.348
<i>I think the eau claire show</i>

01:55.350 --> 01:57.617
<i>Had the kind of feeling</i>

01:57.619 --> 01:58.852
<i>That if you had been
at these shows,</i>

01:58.854 --> 02:00.420
<i>You wouldn't question it,</i>

02:00.422 --> 02:02.155
