We both know
all <i>I'm</i> gonna get
is a slap on the old wrist

14:05.211 --> 14:06.906
and a formal apology

14:06.979 --> 14:09.072
and a case of champagne
from the governor.

Why <i>don't</i>
we all just try to
move this thing along

14:11.217 --> 14:12.741

14:13.285 --> 14:15.947
Well, Mr. Biederman,
off the record,

14:16.322 --> 14:17.949
I am going to
hurry this along,

14:18.023 --> 14:20.287
but <i>it's</i> because

make me sick

14:20.359 --> 14:23.658

Well,
<i>that's</i> good to hear, you...

56:41.364 --> 56:42.888
Pussy.
Pussy.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.368
So are you gonna move
or do my friends have
to move you for me?

56:47.704 --> 56:50.798
Good, because I <i>don't</i>
take no crap from no

56:52.742 --> 56:55.540
Lucian Freud-Iooking
pussies like you.

56:58.014 --> 57:00.482
MAN: Hey. Get your fingers
out of my plate! You crazy?

57:02.619 --> 57:07.147
Wow. I really, really
<i>can't</i> believe that worked.

57:10.627 --> 57:12.026

Of all the bathroom stalls
in all the correctional
facilities in all the world,

57:30.013 --> 57:31.776
he walks into mine.

57:37.687 --> 57:40.019
<i>Haven't</i> you heard the news,
Barry?

57:40.089 --> 57:41.852
The news? Oh, yeah.

Barry finally pitches,
Pisces catches,

57:50.066 --> 57:51.931
(SNICKERING)

57:53.269 --> 57:55.328
<i>Don't</i> even think about it,
Barry.

58:05.248 --> 58:06.909
That hurt, Nelson.

58:08.017 --> 58:09.541
Not physically,

58:10.220 --> 58:11.619
but I thought
<i>we'd</i> gotten past

58:11.688 --> 58:13.349
this point
in our relationship.

58:13.857 --> 58:15.984
What are you talking about?

58:16.693 --> 58:19.127
Well,
over the last few months

58:19.195 --> 58:20.787
I've started to
like you a lot.

58:21.364 --> 58:23.958
Grown accustomed
to your face, if you will.

58:24.033 --> 58:27.298
Thought you felt
the same way,
but I see now.

58:29.839 --> 58:32.171
I've been living
in a <i>fool's</i> paradise.

58:32.242 --> 58:33.709
Look, I should
really get back to...

58:35.178 --> 58:37.112
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

58:39.382 --> 58:42.112
Is this how you treat
someone you love?

58:43.086 --> 58:45.281
Choking them
in a <i>men's</i> room?

58:47.924 --> 58:48.982
No.

58:50.193 --> 58:51.683
I <i>don't</i> know.

58:52.729 --> 58:53.991
Maybe.

58:56.032 --> 58:57.294
Oh, shit!

59:03.840 --> 59:08.436
Maybe I was thinking
<i>you'd</i> forget all about me

59:08.912 --> 59:12.245
if you <i>wasn't</i> scared
I was gonna cut your nuts off.

59:13.583 --> 59:15.483
Maybe behind the facade,

59:16.286 --> 59:18.948
<i>there's</i> just
a scared little boy

59:19.022 --> 59:20.455
who <i>didn't</i> never
get enough love.

59:28.965 --> 59:30.432
Look, Barry...

59:30.700 --> 59:31.689
I never thought...

59:31.768 --> 59:33.235
Oh, just leave me alone.

59:37.340 --> 59:38.398
Go to him.

59:39.943 --> 59:41.240
Go to him.

59:43.746 --> 59:44.872
Barry.

59:52.922 --> 59:54.116
Barry.

59:54.557 --> 59:55.751
Pisces.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.759
Get him!

59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.819
Kick his ass.
<i>Let's</i> go!

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.758
Stop!

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:07.564
Did he touch you, boss?
We'll gut him, right here.

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:09.633
(FARTS)
Yes, he touched me.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:12.434
Sorry. That was me.
Keep going.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.638
But not like that.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.072
<i>I'm</i> giving him
a pass this time.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.241
What are you ladies up to?

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.886
You, Lyshitski,

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.186
Are you kidding me?
I <i>didn't</i> even do anything.

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:31.522
They're over there.
<i>I'm</i> over here.

<i>Don't</i> you have eyes?

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.027
In the hole!

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.989
<i>JOHN. The system</i>
<i>is one shifty prick.</i>

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:39.057
<i>You dodge right,</i>

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.195
<i>You think you're on top of it,</i>
<i>suddenly you're underneath it.</i>

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.869
<i>The ass end</i>
<i>of the punch-line.</i>

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:53.473
<i>During my retreat,</i>
<i>Nelson had become</i>
<i>king of the crapper,</i>

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:55.547
<i>and nobody seemed to flinch.</i>

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.381
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.516
<i>They're eating up his</i>
<i>fancy-ass rich-boy act</i>

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.754
<i>like he was Ben & Jerry's</i>
<i>Heroin Chunk.</i>

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.820
So at exactly
the appointed minute

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:12.026
when old <i>LaRoche's</i>

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.898

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hey, John.
Hey.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.557
<i>Didn't</i> see you there.

<i>It's</i> good to see you.
Yeah.

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:15.661
You know,
I've been meaning to
talk to you about something.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.200
<i>What's</i> that?
Remember when
I first got in here?

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.330
I had the balls of a soufflé,
I'll be honest with you.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.532
But you changed that, John,
you really did.
Did I?

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:25.631
Yeah.

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:28.472
I owe everything that
I am today to you, John.
I really do.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:31.240
I mean, you gave me
my self-esteem back.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.248
I've got the love of a man.
Wow, good!

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:34.578
All the things
that you could want.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.777
I found myself and
I just feel like
I really wanna

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.083
give you something,
John, I do.
Perfect! Yeah.

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:41.055
Can I get you
some cigarettes?
No. <i>I'm</i> good.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:45.424
What about porn?
Cigarettes and porn?
No. <i>I'm</i> good.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.989
John, you're the greatest.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.466
I wanna say, from

Yeah?

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.162

<i>and going home.</i>

You got to look
good for court.

You wanna go out tonight?

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.712

were thinking about

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.304
going down
to the laundry room,

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.974
drinking some
toilet wine,

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.948
and beating up
some of the new guys.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.156
Or we could just stay in
and drink toilet wine here.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.927
We never go out anymore.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:11.275
Well, I've got to
hand it to you, buddy.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.282
You're a bigger man
than I thought you were.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.243
They beat you up,

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.148
they robbed you
of your dignity,

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.711
they pissed in your food,

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.621
but they <i>didn't</i> break you.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.524
And with the
revolving-door policy
of <i>today's</i> prison system,

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.686
you're probably gonna
get paroled tomorrow.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.722
They pissed in my food?

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.198
What difference
does it make?

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.701
You're getting out tomorrow
and <i>I'm</i> proud of you.

Really?
Really.

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.965
In fact,
I snuck you in
a going-away present.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.841
Good luck at your hearing.
I'll see you in 1-to-3.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.080

Okay.

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:50.243

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.079

I've been
looking out for you

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:36.631
and then I bust my nuts
getting you
this goddamn fruity soda

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.533
Well, screw you, pal.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.334

It has.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.645
We are friends.

say, some shit-eating
fruit fly were to come in here

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:19.451
and mess with them
in any way whatsoever,

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.620
we, and by <i>"we"</i> I mean

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:24.290
me and my brothers
over there,

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:29.861
would stop at nothing
to protect them,

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.738
and they know that.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.508
So that is why I think

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.669
you're gonna score
Baby Duck wine 100 out of 100

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.337
on your next review.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:41.314
Because you can taste
the love in every sip.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.805
Okay?

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.814
Yes, I...

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.014
Of course. 100 it is.

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:51.284
Do you hear that?
BARRY: Drink up, bitches.

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:03.393
(GAGGING)

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:08.840
Goddamn,
is that sweet.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.280
<i>(MO VE THIS</i> PLAYING)

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:15.646

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:56.552
Come on!

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.504
Come on, John.

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:20.207
John, <i>isn't</i> this great?

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:23.569
Shake that body
for me, Johnny.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.473
Come on, Lyshitski.

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:38.418
