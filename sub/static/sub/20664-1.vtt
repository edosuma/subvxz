00:48.691 --> 00:50.427
Nathalie!

00:52.813 --> 00:54.601
I'm coming!

01:02.444 --> 01:06.546
<i>Can we put ourselves
in the place of the other?</i>

01:49.850 --> 01:53.132
Definitely not easy
music to listen to.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.486
- I would't play it at home.
- For sure.

01:57.657 --> 01:59.627
You have to see it.

02:01.006 --> 02:03.692
- Music in general?
- Yes.

02:03.882 --> 02:07.040
It's meant to be seen,
not just heard.

02:07.758 --> 02:11.466
"A great French writer
wanted to rest here

02:11.798 --> 02:15.170
"to hear only the
sea and wind.

02:15.216 --> 02:18.124
"Passerby,
respect his last wish. "

02:43.127 --> 02:44.865
Can we go?

02:47.549 --> 02:50.813
Because the tide's coming in.

02:51.735 --> 02:54.657
I don't want to sleep
with Chateaubriand.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.303
Wait up?

03:03.043 --> 03:06.678
- Coming?
- I'll be right there.

03:24.128 --> 03:29.567
THINGS TO COME

03:30.781 --> 03:34.299
<i>Several years later</i>

03:41.230 --> 03:43.968
Don't answer.
It's your mother.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.792
<i>Hello, you've reached
Heinz and Nathalie.</i>

03:47.797 --> 03:50.389
<i>We're not in but you
can leave a message.</i>

03:52.412 --> 03:54.449
<i>Nathalie?</i>

03:54.577 --> 03:56.810
<i>Nathalie, are you there?</i>

03:56.857 --> 03:58.850
<i>It's me.</i>

03:59.421 --> 04:02.531
<i>I'm in such pain, Nathalie.</i>

04:02.916 --> 04:04.923
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

04:04.986 --> 04:08.228
- What is it?
- I can't breathe.

04:08.481 --> 04:12.618
- I took a Xanax.
- How long ago?

04:12.784 --> 04:15.862
<i>45 minutes.
Can I take another?</i>

04:15.968 --> 04:19.401
- Sure, take one now.
- It doesn't help.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.713
It'll be fine!

04:23.045 --> 04:26.733
<i>I'll call the firemen.
I can't stay like this.</i>

04:26.803 --> 04:29.994
We can't call the firemen
for every panic attack.

04:30.391 --> 04:32.657
<i>You can't come?</i>

04:32.856 --> 04:35.718
Now? Are you crazy?
See the time?

04:36.034 --> 04:38.713
I have to sleep.
I get up at 6.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.846
<i>The Radical Loser</i>

05:08.380 --> 05:11.993
If the reform passes,
us kids won't find work.

05:12.052 --> 05:13.993
Already 25% uneployment!

05:14.348 --> 05:17.659
When we finish school,
we won't find jobs!

05:17.755 --> 05:20.430
Let's show them
we won't give up!

05:20.577 --> 05:24.657
- You can't enter!
- You can't stop me from working!

05:24.675 --> 05:28.663
- Majority rules in democracy!
- Let the teacher in.

05:29.057 --> 05:32.876
- Everyone together!
- Unbelievable...

05:37.574 --> 05:39.388
Everyone together...

05:48.700 --> 05:50.741
Good morning.

05:58.712 --> 06:01.597
- Can we have a debate?
- A debate?

06:01.853 --> 06:04.094
On the reform.
To get your opinion.

06:04.437 --> 06:07.375
I don't have to give
my opinion on politics.

06:07.718 --> 06:11.310
But blocking the
entrance is pathetic.

06:11.616 --> 06:14.713
Students deciding if
teachers can work?

06:14.889 --> 06:17.800
We have to ask freshmen
if we can teach now.

06:18.339 --> 06:21.147
They won't let
Antonia come in.

06:21.359 --> 06:23.767
Great!
I've had enough.

06:25.015 --> 06:29.008
- Respect different convictions!
- You have none!

06:29.136 --> 06:31.006
You just want to graduate!

06:31.219 --> 06:34.204
You're in school and
speak of retirement!

06:35.022 --> 06:38.487
- Enough!
- Your talk of '68 is nonsense!

06:38.834 --> 06:41.533
- You're selfish!
- Us, selfish!

06:41.706 --> 06:45.199
This isn't for us,
but for our parents, for workers.

06:45.373 --> 06:49.441
- For people that work hard all their lives!
- For our futures.

06:49.699 --> 06:52.179
And you're not concerned?

06:52.263 --> 06:56.669
- I'm not here to talk politics,
but to teach. - Collaborationist!

06:56.764 --> 07:01.516
- You don't mind working until you're 67?
- I love my job. I'm in no rush.

07:01.537 --> 07:05.694
- Teachers have no lives.
- What about people who slave away?

07:05.698 --> 07:08.662
- Meaning people like you?
- Butt out!

07:08.857 --> 07:13.042
- Listen to you! Unbelievable!
- Let my students enter.

07:13.097 --> 07:14.986
Let the scabs in!

07:27.101 --> 07:29.356
- Open your books.
- Yes, madame.

07:29.547 --> 07:32.182
There's no time for class.

07:32.531 --> 07:34.675
Okay, then.

07:36.695 --> 07:40.232
Then consider this
quotation of Rousseau's:

07:42.871 --> 07:45.735
"If there were a nation of Gods,

07:46.043 --> 07:49.006
"it would govern itself democratically.

07:51.382 --> 07:54.060
"A government so perfect...

07:55.471 --> 07:58.094
"is not suited to men. "

07:59.652 --> 08:02.642
Think it over then
we'll discuss it.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.548
Don't misinterpret it.

08:17.641 --> 08:20.634
Remember, Rousseau wrote
"The Social Contract",

08:20.818 --> 08:24.135
inspiring "The Declaration of the
Rights of Man and of the Citizen".

08:25.245 --> 08:28.211
His ideas formed the Revolution.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.007
Fabien!

08:54.054 --> 08:57.038
- Tutoring?
- Yes. And I wanted to say hi.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.286
- How nice. Is all well?
- Yes.

08:59.399 --> 09:01.534
- And you?
- Fine, very well.

09:02.029 --> 09:04.694
I have two memories
of my senior year.

09:05.258 --> 09:09.587
The hospital where my mom
and I waited as my dad died.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.686
And your class, where I discovered
philosophy. I had to tell you.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.589
I'm touched.

09:18.553 --> 09:20.105
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:22.553 --> 09:27.628
How you said to hold on, to never let go,
all your ideas and books.

09:27.759 --> 09:31.726
It annoyed me, a lot.
But it helped me get by.

09:31.872 --> 09:36.437
- No need. You had an iron will.
- No, it was more complicated.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.692
I skipped classes,
got high at home.

09:40.018 --> 09:42.245
You put pressure on me.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.921
École Normale was your idea.
My mom had no idea what it was.

09:47.042 --> 09:50.203
Come on, it was your calling.
It was obvious.

09:50.689 --> 09:53.147
Your essays were excellent,
very clear.

09:53.219 --> 09:56.154
All I did was correct spelling.

09:56.172 --> 09:57.924
That's all.

09:57.941 --> 10:00.746
- Is your PhD coming alone?
- No, not really.

10:00.933 --> 10:06.121
- Since I stopped teaching, I do odd jobs.
- Writing for my Essay Collection.

10:06.699 --> 10:08.582
Or less fun stuff.

10:08.718 --> 10:12.042
- I do other things in my free time.
- Like what?

10:12.322 --> 10:15.607
I'm involved in a an anarchist group.

10:15.642 --> 10:18.664
I see my girlfriend.
I enjoy life.

10:18.706 --> 10:20.926
More to life than philosophy.

10:22.425 --> 10:26.508
Can you get me a few copies
of my essay on Adorno?

10:26.689 --> 10:31.073
Sure, I'll pick some up at Cartet.
I just finished this. It's great.

10:31.154 --> 10:33.576
- Tell me what you think.
- Thank you.

10:34.597 --> 10:36.334
See you.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.045
Thanks for coming by.

10:54.223 --> 10:56.312
How did you manage today?

10:57.131 --> 11:00.323
- It was fine.
- No problem entering the high school?

11:00.364 --> 11:02.146
No... yes.

11:02.265 --> 11:05.995
- As I went in, a kid looked
at me threateningly. - And?

11:06.686 --> 11:12.118
I said: "I know who you are.
One more step and you'll regret it. "

11:12.228 --> 11:14.173
He ran away.

11:14.283 --> 11:16.415
- You were bluffing.
- Nope.

11:25.546 --> 11:27.379
What was your class on?

11:27.479 --> 11:29.348
Empiricism and rationalism.

11:29.359 --> 11:31.638
Were they concentrated?

11:31.895 --> 11:35.168
- Totally concentrated.
- Of course.

11:35.268 --> 11:36.929
You terrorize them.

11:36.957 --> 11:40.978
No, I make them responsible.
On time and attentive.

11:40.986 --> 11:44.081
I said: "One word about
retirement and you're out. "

11:52.296 --> 11:54.384
How many Adornos do you want?

11:54.666 --> 11:58.627
- A dozen. Have you sold any?
- Not many.

11:59.183 --> 12:03.063
We'll see in September.
The Foucaults are downstairs.

12:03.141 --> 12:05.455
They still sell well.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.445
- Nathalie?
- How are you?

12:08.522 --> 12:10.286
- And you?
- Fine.

12:10.565 --> 12:14.033
- Getting through these strikes?
- Don't bring it up.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.299
What are you two
doing this summer?

12:20.387 --> 12:25.827
If my mother lets us leave, we'll go to
Heinz place in Brittany. I can't wait.

12:27.364 --> 12:29.515
- This is Amélie.
- Hello.

12:29.806 --> 12:33.500
Daniel has replaced Clélia.
I don't know if you've met.

12:33.524 --> 12:35.471
I think we spoke on the phone.

12:37.289 --> 12:42.860
So... we want to show you how we
intend to redesign your textbook.

12:42.889 --> 12:46.617
To discuss this new edition
before undertaking anything.

12:46.787 --> 12:51.418
We want to maintain the
specificity of the 2004 version.

12:51.546 --> 12:54.956
It remains an anthology
devoid of commentary

12:55.051 --> 12:58.429
that might come between
teacher and student.

12:58.925 --> 13:00.623
A few figures...

13:03.887 --> 13:05.334
Which way?

13:05.703 --> 13:07.298
Like this.

13:11.052 --> 13:12.741
Can you break them down?

13:12.782 --> 13:15.687
In sum, according to
qualitative analyses,

13:15.788 --> 13:19.084
Cartet remains the first
choice of teachers.

13:19.269 --> 13:22.579
But sales figures give our
competitors a big lead.

13:22.638 --> 13:24.427
Excuse me.

13:29.588 --> 13:34.274
Our aim is to strengthen its
quality as a reference book,

13:34.367 --> 13:37.738
while striving to meet
market expectations.

13:38.062 --> 13:40.724
Look through it at home.
in short,

13:40.960 --> 13:45.386
our aim is to upgrade the textbook,
to humanize it.

13:45.431 --> 13:48.801
To give it the pedagogical
makeover it needs.

13:48.824 --> 13:52.201
We'd like to add facilitators
and product tie-ins.

13:52.220 --> 13:56.481
Make it more attractive,
less austere.

13:56.656 --> 14:00.663
Show her the graphic designer's
suggestions for the Essay Collection.

14:00.727 --> 14:02.916
You're changing my collection?

14:03.069 --> 14:08.700
- It's the most costly and least profitable
collection. - And the most prestigious.

14:08.910 --> 14:13.118
No doubt, but we can't sit back
and watch sales plummet.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.723
Just a proposal.

14:23.931 --> 14:28.002
- If you don't like it...
- It's bad beyond belief.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.460
Like an ad for M&M's.

14:30.926 --> 14:33.364
What I've always fought against.

14:33.546 --> 14:37.957
The original cover is classy,
but very plain.

14:38.039 --> 14:41.582
The new one is modern,
aggressive and catchy.

14:41.617 --> 14:44.392
- We did test.
- It's really hard to miss.

14:44.756 --> 14:46.826
A total eye-sore!

14:48.235 --> 14:49.801
Mrs. Chazeaux!

14:50.272 --> 14:51.812
Mrs. Chazeaux!

14:52.118 --> 14:57.206
Sorry, but you must pay for the books.
You'll get 50% off, of couse.

14:57.854 --> 15:01.933
We used to get 20 copies. Now you
don't send them and we pay?

15:06.432 --> 15:07.857
Taking the metro?

15:08.129 --> 15:11.431
- Can I walk you?
- I'd like that.

15:13.185 --> 15:16.028
I read your protégé's
text on Adorno.

15:16.478 --> 15:18.975
- Brilliant, for sure.
- I agree.

15:19.233 --> 15:23.388
But I wonder if he can
keep writing schoolbooks.

15:23.511 --> 15:25.517
Why?
It's extremely limpid.

15:25.708 --> 15:28.578
He keeps advocating his radical ideas.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.244
It comes across in every line.

15:31.325 --> 15:36.451
I prefer a text a bit rhapsodic by
someone who thinks out of the box,

15:36.751 --> 15:41.929
- over the bland writing of marketing
fiends. - They do their job.

15:42.135 --> 15:44.761
You know I didn't hire them.

16:03.895 --> 16:05.360
Still in bed?

16:07.078 --> 16:09.039
Yeah, Pandora, hide.

16:10.456 --> 16:13.474
I bought you salmon
and sheep-milk jogurt.

16:18.743 --> 16:21.790
I'm in a rush.
I have the kids for lunch.

16:22.886 --> 16:25.637
Staying in bed all day?

16:26.392 --> 16:29.426
I got you the papers.
Le Monde and Libé.

16:29.582 --> 16:31.997
Anything worth reading?

16:32.157 --> 16:35.900
Besides the strike,
Iranian repression, if you care.

17:10.204 --> 17:14.810
Can't my grandchildren come visit?
I miss them.

17:14.935 --> 17:17.559
They'd come if you left your bed.

17:17.686 --> 17:23.028
- And filled your fridge.
- What do you think? Not bad, huh?

17:23.107 --> 17:25.357
- Where did you get it?
- It's mine.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.117
I never saw it before.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.954
Did you buy clothes again?

17:31.237 --> 17:33.725
Barbara Bui?
Are you kidding?

17:33.883 --> 17:37.726
- With what money? Another bad check?
- I gained weight.

17:40.522 --> 17:44.618
- You went alone?
- Inés came along. We took a taxi.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.601
For someone depressed,
you seem fine.

17:48.355 --> 17:50.776
I had to buy something.

17:50.839 --> 17:53.682
- I have a role next week.
- Really?

17:53.830 --> 17:54.596
As what?

17:54.845 --> 17:58.486
A TV crime movie.
I play a cadaver.

18:00.033 --> 18:02.599
Can you get my glasses?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.762
On the shelf.

18:11.213 --> 18:13.350
At least it won't be tiring.

18:13.424 --> 18:16.498
Guess again.
Two hours of makeup.

18:19.674 --> 18:21.451
Here they are.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.456
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:25.236 --> 18:27.391
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:28.288 --> 18:29.770
Let's eat.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.449
You okay?

18:32.631 --> 18:37.020
- Who wrote the article?
- Simone something. Italian name.

18:37.103 --> 18:39.943
- Not Simone Pozzi?
- That's it.

18:40.371 --> 18:43.420
I know her. A repulsive Stalinist.

18:43.515 --> 18:48.150
When we met, your mom was handing
out comie tracts. A real terror.

18:48.245 --> 18:52.175
Okay, I was a communist.
3 years. No shame.

18:52.301 --> 18:56.525
- Just 3 years...
- Like most intellectuals then.

18:56.533 --> 18:59.257
- Not me.
- No, not you.

18:59.456 --> 19:03.973
- She was even in the USSR. - So what?
I came back disenchanted.

19:04.147 --> 19:09.106
- I read Solzhenitsyn, end of story.
- Always the last word. You never change.

19:09.837 --> 19:12.287
We're not all clairvoyant like you.

19:13.506 --> 19:17.707
True, your father hasn't
changed since he was 18.

19:17.751 --> 19:20.727
"Starry sky above and
moral law within. "

19:20.831 --> 19:24.358
- Already his credo in '68.
- Granted.

19:24.359 --> 19:26.554
A barrel of laughs too.

19:27.262 --> 19:28.948
It's Fabien.

19:29.824 --> 19:32.657
- Who is it?
- Her favorite, you know?

19:32.692 --> 19:35.667
- I have no idea.
- The son she'd have liked.

19:35.780 --> 19:40.665
- My opposite, physically and
intellectually. - You're such idiots!

19:41.021 --> 19:44.089
- Her former student, the writer.
- Now I see.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.563
Quiet down!
He's coming.

19:50.372 --> 19:52.544
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:52.586 --> 19:54.219
You okay?

19:54.719 --> 19:56.291
Come in.

19:56.355 --> 19:59.144
- I won't bother you.
- It's no bother.

19:59.250 --> 20:03.031
- I'm in a rush anyway.
- 5 minutes. Don't just stand there.

20:04.979 --> 20:08.268
- Something wrong?
- Sorry, I look like a bum.

20:08.409 --> 20:12.067
- I spend all night outside.
- Outside?

20:12.136 --> 20:15.952
Hello.
Protesting against an eviction.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.351
Have a seat.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.325
Friends were arrested.
My girlfriend got hit.

20:22.413 --> 20:24.727
- Nothing serious?
- Not really.

20:24.743 --> 20:27.602
- Do you do this often?
- Sometimes.

20:27.683 --> 20:31.405
- I got your books. They're
on the table. - Thank you.

20:31.425 --> 20:33.129
Bon appétit.

20:38.261 --> 20:41.462
- How are my strawberries?
- Delicious.

20:42.064 --> 20:43.543
<i>Here.</i>

20:44.320 --> 20:46.262
<i>Do you want more?</i>

20:51.675 --> 20:54.279
Have a seat.
Have some strawberries.

20:58.265 --> 21:00.014
I read your book.

21:00.119 --> 21:04.579
- What is it?
- An incredible text on terrorism.

21:04.698 --> 21:08.221
- You never mentioned it.
- What? Sure I did.

21:08.322 --> 21:10.651
I didn't have the honor.

21:10.730 --> 21:14.611
- What do you think?
- Very well written...

21:14.862 --> 21:17.302
but it preaches
to the converted.

21:17.396 --> 21:19.288
I don't think so.

21:19.340 --> 21:23.446
I dislike how it confuses
radicalism and terrorism.

21:23.555 --> 21:25.611
No, I disagree.

21:26.483 --> 21:30.363
Here.
This is just came out in French.

21:31.376 --> 21:33.978
- Günther Anders.
- Who's he?

21:34.101 --> 21:35.399
A philosopher.

21:35.402 --> 21:38.898
- Hannah Arendt's first husband.
- I'll make the coffee.

21:39.082 --> 21:41.907
I was waiting fot it
to come back out.

21:41.998 --> 21:44.778
Can I write on it
for your collection?

21:44.888 --> 21:48.235
Why not?
I'll read it and tell you.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.728
- Thanks.
- Let's see.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.667
<i>The Obsolescence of Man.</i>

21:54.826 --> 21:57.253
- What "obsolescence"?
- Johann...

21:57.940 --> 22:00.050
Just kidding.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.384
How do you say it in German?

22:02.716 --> 22:04.409
Not great either.

22:07.353 --> 22:10.559
- Pronounce it, Mom.
- Stop teasing me!

22:10.609 --> 22:13.096
What is it?
They've ganged up.

22:15.037 --> 22:17.725
You could have made an effort.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.395
You were like ice.

22:20.891 --> 22:24.331
- I don't like him much.
- What don't you like?

22:25.426 --> 22:29.129
Expert on everything,
a real know-it-all.

22:29.134 --> 22:30.885
You don't know him.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.327
He fawns when he needs you,

22:35.422 --> 22:39.540
- but walks over you when you're
in his way. - You're crazy!

22:39.646 --> 22:43.102
The sweetest, kindest student
I've ever had.

22:45.610 --> 22:48.892
And he's brave.
- Because he's Mr. Protestor?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.301
Not just that.
Spare me your sarcasm.

22:54.882 --> 22:57.060
You're jealous?

22:57.407 --> 22:59.542
Jelaous.
Please!

23:18.529 --> 23:19.915
Dad!

23:20.766 --> 23:22.247
Dad!

23:23.423 --> 23:27.231
- Chloé. What a nice suprise.
- I was nearby.

23:37.427 --> 23:41.236
- I think you want to
say something. - Yes.

23:41.369 --> 23:43.365
But it's not easy.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.562
- Are you in trouble?
- No.

23:47.798 --> 23:51.141
- I know. You're pregnant.
- Not at all.

23:52.568 --> 23:55.098
What is it then? Tell me.

23:55.121 --> 23:57.908
I know you're seeing someone.

24:05.529 --> 24:07.626
- Does Mom know?
- No.

24:07.721 --> 24:09.636
Don't worry.
I won't say.

24:13.132 --> 24:16.194
But Johann and I
want you to choose.

24:18.994 --> 24:20.978
Quickly, Dad.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.046
<i>Mom</i>

24:40.841 --> 24:42.005
Hello!

24:42.089 --> 24:44.672
"Can the truth be debated?"

24:46.814 --> 24:49.502
- Go ahead.
- I don't get it.

24:49.706 --> 24:51.859
Why couldn't it be debated?

24:52.181 --> 24:53.597
Really?

24:53.672 --> 24:58.022
- What about areas where it's established?
- It's always contestable.

24:58.623 --> 25:02.182
No one still says the Sun
revolves round the Earth.

25:02.325 --> 25:05.440
In science,
there are established truths.

25:06.457 --> 25:08.611
Is that the only area?

25:08.767 --> 25:10.859
- History too.
- Exactly.

25:10.911 --> 25:13.947
The storming of the
Bastille on July 14th, 1789,

25:13.995 --> 25:18.436
or Nazi extermination of Jews
leave no room for debate.

25:18.532 --> 25:23.405
Be careful. Debating truth is one thing,
contesting it another.

25:23.523 --> 25:27.222
- When can we say truth is established?
- That's the question.

25:28.013 --> 25:32.255
In the end, the problem is
less the existence of truth,

25:32.323 --> 25:34.972
than criteria for establishing it.

25:39.359 --> 25:43.647
Distinguish between the areas
where truth can be proved,

25:43.782 --> 25:46.736
from those concerned with belief,

25:46.776 --> 25:51.086
conviction, faith,
but not established truths.

25:51.175 --> 25:55.125
- Like art. We can't speak
of truth in art. - Really?

25:55.225 --> 25:59.008
We still question the genius
of Homer and Shakespeare?

25:59.043 --> 26:03.506
- A recent movie said Shakespeare's
a sham. - It's too late.

26:03.954 --> 26:06.434
Mozart, Proust, Van Gogh:
time decided.

26:06.530 --> 26:09.364
There's truth in art,
established over time.

26:09.394 --> 26:11.801
Why can't time get it wrong?

26:15.015 --> 26:16.950
Excuse me.

26:19.317 --> 26:23.017
<i>Nathalie, it's me.
I turned on the gas.</i>

26:24.002 --> 26:25.707
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

26:33.520 --> 26:37.030
I have to go. It's my mother.
She's crazy.

26:37.182 --> 26:39.700
I have to see her.
Sorry.

26:40.117 --> 26:44.345
Antonia, I'll call you tonight
for the next class.

26:44.418 --> 26:47.427
Tell your classmates,
even the strikers.

26:47.509 --> 26:50.053
- They won't come.
- Still...

26:50.204 --> 26:54.318
I'll send you the corrections.
And read Alain's Propos.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.845
I'll tell you which pages.
Goodbye.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.925
How is she?
I'm her daughter.

27:25.017 --> 27:27.175
- It's not serious.
- Thank you.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.913
- You're her daughter?
- Yes.

27:31.982 --> 27:34.782
Enough!
3 times this week, for nothing.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.546
- Three times?
- Not true!

27:37.782 --> 27:40.414
- He's lying!
- We're firemen, not doctors.

27:40.479 --> 27:43.260
I know. I'm sorry.
I keep telling her.

27:43.288 --> 27:47.826
Consider putting her in hospital.
Call an ambulance, but not us.

27:47.918 --> 27:50.743
I won't go to hospital!

27:50.975 --> 27:54.126
- I won't go!
- Sign this release.

27:55.441 --> 27:59.955
- She said she called you. Answer.
- You know how often she calls?

27:59.997 --> 28:02.994
Your mother is your responsibility.

28:11.817 --> 28:15.791
I'm ice cold.
Can I have my mink?

28:19.395 --> 28:22.958
The firemen who tended
to me was cute.

28:25.862 --> 28:29.174
I'll put you in a rest
home for a bit.

28:29.319 --> 28:31.604
You can't do that, Nathalie.

28:32.072 --> 28:35.858
No choice.
I thought your visitors would help.

28:36.153 --> 28:39.943
- You can't be a minute alone.
- Why don't you take me?

28:40.033 --> 28:43.239
What else?
You'll sleep in my bed too?

28:43.509 --> 28:47.378
- I have a husband.
- Yes, it's true.

28:48.130 --> 28:51.191
- What's his name again?
- You kidding?

28:51.274 --> 28:55.052
- No, I swear I forgot. His name?
- Forget it.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.178
Tell me!

28:57.564 --> 29:00.028
- His name is Heinz.
- What?

29:00.478 --> 29:05.159
- Heinz.
- Oh, yeah... what an awful name.

29:05.213 --> 29:06.391
Hello.

29:06.490 --> 29:09.994
How could you marry a guy
with a name like that?

29:10.095 --> 29:13.483
Hello, Mrs. Lavastre.
How are you today?

29:22.903 --> 29:25.198
Thanks.
Go on in.

29:54.192 --> 29:57.568
- Already?
- I said all I had to.

29:57.676 --> 30:00.935
- You have two hours left. Try.
- What for?

30:01.060 --> 30:03.825
This won't change my
grade point average.

30:13.508 --> 30:15.944
Did Antonia choose the essay too?

30:17.113 --> 30:18.505
Good.

30:19.215 --> 30:21.284
That's not a problem.

30:22.391 --> 30:24.854
Don't worry about references.

30:29.354 --> 30:30.891
Hello!

30:37.529 --> 30:40.026
I'm exausted. You?

30:45.486 --> 30:47.828
What is it?
Why so glum?

30:47.939 --> 30:49.490
Nathalie...

30:49.522 --> 30:51.915
I must tell you.
I met someone.

30:53.389 --> 30:54.983
Meaning?

30:57.869 --> 30:59.911
And why tell me?

31:00.584 --> 31:02.713
Couldn't keep it a secret?

31:02.925 --> 31:05.043
I'm moving in with her.

31:05.662 --> 31:07.407
What?

31:11.574 --> 31:15.215
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

31:17.133 --> 31:20.367
- Since when?
- A while.

31:21.002 --> 31:22.980
- A student?
- No...

31:24.932 --> 31:26.635
Who then?

31:27.369 --> 31:29.114
You don't know her.

31:40.247 --> 31:42.527
I though you'd love me forever.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.643
I'm a goddamn idiot!

31:49.840 --> 31:52.617
I'll always love you, Nathalie.
You know it.

31:52.668 --> 31:54.408
Oh, come on.

32:20.218 --> 32:22.609
Lunch is ready.
Just warm it up.

32:22.718 --> 32:25.514
- You're not eating?
- Not here.

32:51.819 --> 32:53.075
Shit!

33:03.030 --> 33:04.208
Thank you.

33:19.276 --> 33:20.855
See you later.

33:25.426 --> 33:30.403
- Did we forget anything?
- She didn't want her books?

33:30.918 --> 33:35.194
No, oddly enough.
We'll be back for Pandora anyway.

33:38.373 --> 33:39.966
I didn't expect this.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.849
- I thought she'd scream.
- She gave up.

33:42.889 --> 33:47.263
Or worry about her cat. She doesn't care.
She didn't even ask!

33:59.465 --> 34:01.608
Those are our birds.

34:02.102 --> 34:05.777
We have many pets here.
Our residents appreciate them.

34:06.151 --> 34:07.633
Hello.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.590
This is the dining room.

34:10.677 --> 34:13.163
Very pretty view of the countryside.

34:40.695 --> 34:42.925
I asked for a room upstairs.

34:42.960 --> 34:47.650
- I'll tell them to change it.
- It's not a problem. I'm fine here.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.292
I'll come back in two days.

34:55.931 --> 34:58.109
You can always call.

34:58.246 --> 34:59.931
You have a phone.

35:01.927 --> 35:03.977
You can go to the hairdresser.

35:04.151 --> 35:06.050
Get a manicure.

35:15.832 --> 35:18.671
If you knew how much
this place cost...

35:21.915 --> 35:25.162
And it's 5 stars
compared to the others.

35:33.862 --> 35:35.837
That fucking smell...

35:36.498 --> 35:38.675
Smell of death.

35:39.419 --> 35:41.460
Pandora! Come on!

35:42.428 --> 35:44.361
Pandora! Come out!

35:49.437 --> 35:51.580
- Come on, Pandora!
- Pandora!

35:51.692 --> 35:53.078
Come on.

35:55.566 --> 35:57.913
We have to remove the radiator.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.318
Get inside.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.646
It's so heavy!

36:20.129 --> 36:21.921
Damn...

36:22.072 --> 36:25.735
What a gift!
And with my allergies...

36:33.914 --> 36:35.792
Go hide, dummy.

36:55.115 --> 36:56.864
What the hell?

36:57.346 --> 36:59.307
What a nerve!

37:44.198 --> 37:45.822
Sorry, I'm late.

37:47.844 --> 37:49.580
I'll lock my bike.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.559
Another night outside?

37:51.607 --> 37:54.108
- I'm moving out of my studio.
- Really?

37:54.159 --> 37:56.024
To what part of Paris?

37:57.820 --> 38:01.345
- To the mountains, in fact.
- The mountains?

38:01.492 --> 38:03.793
My friend and I bought a farm.

38:03.828 --> 38:07.032
- A real steal. Very remote.
- What will you do there?

38:07.161 --> 38:09.749
- Make cheese.
- No, really?

38:09.837 --> 38:11.603
Yes, really.

38:12.697 --> 38:14.455
Okay, not just that.

38:15.063 --> 38:17.133
I'm going to write too.

38:19.106 --> 38:21.067
I can't come visit?

38:21.985 --> 38:24.103
Of course.
As often as you like.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.681
Can I have a puff?
I'm dying for one.

38:44.771 --> 38:47.040
- Want a cigarette?
- No, just a puff.

38:53.806 --> 38:55.931
I have big news as well.

38:56.861 --> 38:58.974
Heinz and I are separating.

38:59.923 --> 39:01.379
I'm going to divorce.

39:01.644 --> 39:03.534
Divorce?

39:05.351 --> 39:07.271
You seemed so...

39:07.639 --> 39:09.343
I don't know. United.

39:09.393 --> 39:12.823
25 years together and he
found another woman.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.346
There you go.

39:14.682 --> 39:16.475
Shit.

39:16.856 --> 39:19.066
Sorry.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.503
No worries.
I'm taking it very well.

39:22.916 --> 39:26.659
Anyway, after 40 women
are fit for the trash.

39:27.385 --> 39:31.213
- How can you say that? Especially you!
- It's the plain truth.

39:31.314 --> 39:33.984
Do many women my age
leave their husbands?

39:33.997 --> 39:37.068
- There are tons of them.
- In movies.

39:37.430 --> 39:40.832
- You'll obviously find someone.
- Yeah, right...

39:40.927 --> 39:42.757
Why not?

39:44.005 --> 39:46.333
I suddenly find you naive.

39:46.869 --> 39:50.707
Who will I start over with?
An old man? No, thanks.

39:51.065 --> 39:53.722
Try young if you don't like old.

39:53.998 --> 39:56.383
As if I'd settle down
with a young guy.

39:56.472 --> 39:58.295
Not my style.

39:58.853 --> 40:01.879
It's not that serious.
My life isn't over.

40:03.998 --> 40:06.221
Deep down, I was prepared.

40:07.022 --> 40:11.433
No reason to pity me. I'm lucky
to be fulfilled intellectually.

40:11.587 --> 40:13.449
It's enough to be happy.

40:13.532 --> 40:15.752
- Really?
- Yes, really.

40:15.787 --> 40:17.044
What a wisdom.

40:18.701 --> 40:21.492
My house in Brittany saddens me.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.979
I mean...
my husband's family house.

40:24.910 --> 40:27.493
Every vacation since our wedding.

40:28.669 --> 40:31.255
It means so much to me.

40:32.155 --> 40:34.571
The love I put into it.

40:35.459 --> 40:38.937
The garden I planted,
designed from A to Z.

40:42.512 --> 40:45.345
To think I have
to give it all up.

40:46.655 --> 40:48.703
All my memories.

40:51.263 --> 40:54.180
The beach where I
saw my kids grow up.

40:54.193 --> 40:56.488
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

41:58.990 --> 42:01.100
Swim.
The water's amazing.

42:29.766 --> 42:31.757
What are you doing?

42:32.140 --> 42:33.815
Making room.

42:34.959 --> 42:39.384
- It's not your last time here.
- Of course it is. What do you think?

42:47.081 --> 42:50.403
I thought you'd keep on
coming without me.

42:50.493 --> 42:53.488
- With a kids.
- No, I don't think so.

43:12.422 --> 43:14.878
I hope she likes flowers.

43:15.476 --> 43:18.269
It'd be a shame to
abandon the garden.

43:18.377 --> 43:20.431
I worked so hard on it.

43:20.533 --> 43:24.080
- You're not overdoing it?
- You won't face up to reality!

43:24.176 --> 43:27.381
You act like everything's the same.
What planet are you on?

43:28.013 --> 43:29.751
Wake up!

44:31.197 --> 44:33.103
There's no dial tone.

44:33.495 --> 44:36.458
I meant to call the phone
company tonight.

44:36.471 --> 44:39.286
What do I do?
No reception here.

44:39.807 --> 44:43.728
- Did you try up on the road?
- I have no network on the road!

44:46.435 --> 44:48.473
Pain in the ass!

44:52.236 --> 44:55.851
Hallo. Yes, hello.
It's Nathalie Chazeaux.

44:55.964 --> 44:59.194
I'm calling to see
how my mother is.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.525
I don't fucking believe it!

45:20.221 --> 45:22.387
Hallo!
Hello!

45:23.372 --> 45:27.505
It's Nathalie Chazeaux.
I called a few seconds ago.

45:29.162 --> 45:31.605
It's to see how my mother is.

45:33.036 --> 45:35.308
Really?
What do you mean?

45:36.416 --> 45:38.191
Since when?

45:40.689 --> 45:42.733
There's nothing you can do?

45:46.399 --> 45:47.994
But...

45:50.749 --> 45:52.437
Yes...

46:01.887 --> 46:03.630
I'm going back to Paris.

46:03.950 --> 46:06.431
My mother hasn't eaten in 3 days.

46:08.171 --> 46:10.346
There's a train in an hour.

46:10.445 --> 46:14.371
- Can you drop me off?
- It's not a ploy to get you back?

46:16.128 --> 46:20.418
Of course it is.
What should I do, let her die?

48:19.515 --> 48:21.288
Hello.

48:25.355 --> 48:27.019
Are you okay?

48:34.213 --> 48:37.856
Why do I subscribe you to papers
if you don't read them?

48:37.891 --> 48:39.860
I'm hungry.

48:40.739 --> 48:43.000
They don't give me any food.

48:43.051 --> 48:45.224
Got something for me?

48:45.636 --> 48:48.971
Any strawberries?
I'd love strawberries.

48:49.232 --> 48:52.567
- And oysters too.
- You're out of luck.

48:54.613 --> 48:56.606
But I have chocolate.

49:01.699 --> 49:04.813
The nurses complain you
won't leave your room.

49:05.465 --> 49:10.056
- Not even for the rec room.
- Those old folk make me want to puke.

49:11.543 --> 49:13.331
<i>I'm expecting...</i>

49:13.564 --> 49:15.947
<i>more demonstrations.</i>

49:15.957 --> 49:20.203
<i>- I'm aware that people suffer.
- Who is this guy?</i>

49:20.427 --> 49:22.493
Are you acting dumb?

49:22.857 --> 49:26.227
It's Sarkozy.
President of France.

49:27.185 --> 49:28.787
He's ugly.

49:29.273 --> 49:31.406
You preferred Chirac?

49:32.558 --> 49:34.451
He wasn't bad.

49:35.722 --> 49:38.948
- He made love with his boots on.
- What?

49:39.237 --> 49:44.029
- Where did you hear that?
- Everyone knows. Except for you.

50:16.058 --> 50:19.097
- Sorry, I'm a little late.
- No big deal.

50:19.172 --> 50:20.988
- All well?
- Yes, and you?

50:21.257 --> 50:23.879
Are they for me?
How beautiful.

50:24.984 --> 50:27.532
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

50:28.468 --> 50:30.309
What a funny cat.

50:30.681 --> 50:33.377
It's my mother's.
Pandora.

50:33.547 --> 50:37.975
She can't keep her. I'm allergic.
If anyone wants her, she's yours.

50:39.625 --> 50:44.424
- What are your vacation plans?
- We are all going to my dad's, in Corsica.

50:44.541 --> 50:47.688
He'll be away.
It'll be cool. We'll rent a car.

50:48.315 --> 50:49.986
And you?

50:50.161 --> 50:51.834
I'd rather not discuss it.

50:51.960 --> 50:55.041
We'll be back in August
for our project.

50:55.315 --> 50:58.965
A new website. Thanks to Simon.
He's a computer wiz.

50:59.034 --> 51:01.218
- A website for what?
- Philosophy.

51:01.279 --> 51:05.197
- How wonderful! - Don't worry.
We won't write the texts.

51:05.516 --> 51:09.780
What we're good at is doing layout,
getting authors...

51:10.155 --> 51:11.926
The "publishing" side.

51:13.210 --> 51:15.994
We thought maybe
you could sponsor us.

51:16.067 --> 51:20.022
Write on occasional text,
reread the main articles.

51:20.163 --> 51:23.218
Maybe write editorials
on current events.

51:23.296 --> 51:26.214
Seen from a philosophical angle,
of course.

51:26.229 --> 51:29.235
- In fact you want to hire me.
- In a way.

52:47.268 --> 52:48.667
What the hell?

53:32.640 --> 53:34.840
Come on, leave me alone.

53:35.179 --> 53:38.109
I missed the end of
the movie as it is.

53:38.114 --> 53:40.844
- Can I walk beside you?
- You've seen me now.

53:40.911 --> 53:42.374
You are beautiful.

53:46.942 --> 53:49.111
Go away.
I don't feel like it.

53:57.059 --> 53:58.382
Yes?

54:01.199 --> 54:02.654
What?

54:04.051 --> 54:07.091
Fell?
What do you mean she fell?

54:09.826 --> 54:11.836
What, is she in a coma?

54:13.257 --> 54:14.808
Huh?!

54:16.052 --> 54:17.469
What?

54:47.916 --> 54:49.805
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Father.

54:49.885 --> 54:51.817
My daughter, Chloé.

54:59.994 --> 55:01.991
Have a seat, please.

55:02.709 --> 55:07.564
I want the ceremony to be here.
My mother lived nearby her whole life.

55:07.584 --> 55:10.089
She was very fond of this church.

55:10.153 --> 55:14.790
- She rarely came, but...
- Yes, I don't recall seeing her often.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.862
But she was a believer.

55:17.201 --> 55:19.800
She was raised by her grandmother.

55:20.184 --> 55:23.246
As a child she was very frail,
always sick.

55:23.567 --> 55:25.534
Her mother died young.

55:25.538 --> 55:28.908
Her father was a thug.
She barely knew him.

55:30.498 --> 55:34.881
My mother spent her life suffering
from having felt abandoned.

55:38.419 --> 55:42.478
She didn't go to school.
It was her biggest regret.

55:44.610 --> 55:49.615
She pushed me to go to university
and become a teacher.

55:51.998 --> 55:55.373
She was proud her daughter
taught philosophy.

55:56.132 --> 55:58.085
What did she do?

55:58.165 --> 56:00.208
What was her passion?

56:01.740 --> 56:03.365
Did she work?

56:03.616 --> 56:06.164
She was a model.
She was very pretty.

56:07.341 --> 56:09.675
After that, a medical rep.

56:10.118 --> 56:14.125
She married 3 times.
My father was her second husband.

56:14.204 --> 56:17.802
- They divorced after two years.
- Why divorce?

56:18.991 --> 56:20.856
He was unfaithful.

56:20.966 --> 56:23.957
She loved him to the end.
For her, he was the only one.

56:24.598 --> 56:27.575
- Are you an only child?
- Yes, yes, uh-huh.

56:29.340 --> 56:33.860
She has regained this warmth
in her eternal resting place.

56:35.090 --> 56:38.027
She leaves behind her
a proud heritage...

56:38.470 --> 56:42.253
of love,
and of hope.

56:44.176 --> 56:48.268
What better tribute could you
have rendered to your mother

56:48.303 --> 56:51.105
than becoming a philosophy teacher?

56:51.752 --> 56:53.908
For we know

56:53.990 --> 56:59.612
that doubt and questioning are
inextricably bound up with faith.

57:00.407 --> 57:03.075
You have made this your life.

57:15.463 --> 57:17.887
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

57:17.999 --> 57:20.467
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

57:30.358 --> 57:32.553
Les Ulis, next exit.

57:32.655 --> 57:36.164
Not at all.
We got off at Villebon-sur-Yvette.

57:36.555 --> 57:40.642
Then to the roundabout,
and take Youri Gagarine Street.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.403
- Make up your minds.
- Turn here, Dad.

57:43.455 --> 57:45.491
- When?
- Now!

57:45.869 --> 57:48.728
You try!
Their thing is bullshit.

58:23.186 --> 58:26.292
"This is what I see and
what troubles me.

58:26.470 --> 58:30.608
"I look on all sides,
and see only darkness everywhere.

58:30.634 --> 58:34.810
"Nature presents to me,
nothing but doubt and concern.

58:35.827 --> 58:38.682
"If I saw nothing there
which revealed a Divinity,

58:39.298 --> 58:42.183
"I would come to a
negative conclusion.

58:42.793 --> 58:46.025
"If I saw everywhere
the signs of a Creator,

58:46.377 --> 58:48.746
"I would remain peacefully in faith.

58:48.838 --> 58:52.874
"But, seeing too much to deny
and too little to be sure,

58:53.465 --> 58:55.794
"I am in a state to be pitied.

58:56.140 --> 58:59.477
<i>"I have 100 times wished
that if a God maintains nature,</i>

58:59.779 --> 59:02.635
<i>"it should testify
to Him unequivocally.</i>

59:03.193 --> 59:05.838
<i>"If the signs Nature
gives are deceptive,</i>

59:05.840 --> 59:08.219
<i>"He should suppress them fully.</i>

59:08.605 --> 59:10.983
<i>"Nature should say
everything or nothing</i>

59:11.049 --> 59:13.913
<i>"so I see which cause to follow.</i>

59:14.650 --> 59:17.063
<i>"But in my present state,</i>

59:17.293 --> 59:20.446
<i>"ignorant of what I am
or of what I must do,</i>

59:20.510 --> 59:23.463
<i>"I know neither my
condition nor my duty</i>

59:23.776 --> 59:29.225
<i>"My heart inclines to know where
is the true good in order to follow it.</i>

59:29.695 --> 59:33.127
<i>"Nothing would be too
dear to me for eternity. "</i>

01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:07.336
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:10.870
Let's go next door.

01:00:13.982 --> 01:00:15.694
Daniel will join us.

01:00:20.504 --> 01:00:22.261
You summoned me?

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:27.756
After having consulted
our marketing division,

01:00:27.766 --> 01:00:30.627
we decided not to renew
the old textbook.

01:00:30.646 --> 01:00:34.318
We prefer to start from scratch,
with a new team.

01:00:35.735 --> 01:00:37.362
Okay.
Is that all?

01:00:38.371 --> 01:00:39.820
No.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:44.027
We also have to say that the
Essay Collection is being reviewed.

01:00:44.246 --> 01:00:47.830
But even repackaged,
it seems iffy.

01:00:48.658 --> 01:00:50.894
The future seems compromised.

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:56.954
- And the Horkheimer book?
- The contract was signed.

01:00:57.115 --> 01:01:01.516
Through we do have doubts about an
umpteenth text on the Frankfurt school.

01:01:01.613 --> 01:01:03.578
What's done is done.

01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:08.948
Christelle will contact you in September
to finalize the layout.

01:01:09.277 --> 01:01:11.096
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:32.013
<i>Nathalie, I came by this morning
for the last of my things.</i>

01:01:32.045 --> 01:01:35.036
<i>I did my best to
respect our agreement.</i>

01:01:35.084 --> 01:01:38.619
<i>I think we misplaced
The World as Will and Representation.</i>

01:01:38.924 --> 01:01:41.341
<i>If you find it,
can you put it aside?</i>

01:01:41.373 --> 01:01:43.058
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:51.400
Oh, man!

01:02:03.634 --> 01:02:07.258
No way!
My Levinas books with all my notes.

01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:08.975
Unbelievable.

01:02:09.879 --> 01:02:11.835
And Buber too?

01:02:11.848 --> 01:02:13.509
How could he?

01:02:13.672 --> 01:02:15.094
Bastard!

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:19.958
It's too much!

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:33.656
Thank you.

01:02:34.172 --> 01:02:35.826
Thanks a lot.

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.502
- How are you?
- And you? Here she is!

01:03:11.606 --> 01:03:14.147
- Safe trip?
- It was fine.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.222
- She's heavy.
- What's her name?

01:03:17.257 --> 01:03:19.864
- Pandora.
- Hey, Pandora!

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:24.603
- Full house. It's a mess.
- Excellent. Who's there?

01:03:24.649 --> 01:03:28.471
German friends who run an
alternative publishing house.

01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:31.960
We're finishing a book together.
I'm being unfaithful.

01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:34.701
- Go on, I got fired.
- No way.

01:03:34.807 --> 01:03:37.353
Your Horkheimer essay
is still coming out.

01:03:39.573 --> 01:03:41.948
So what's your book about?

01:03:42.164 --> 01:03:45.681
Finding a way out of
the concept of disaster.

01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:48.705
But while refusing
political compromise.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:53.410
Creating a real countervailing power,
alternative lifestyles.

01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:55.516
Quite an agenda.

01:03:58.755 --> 01:04:02.668
Be good or straight to the forest.
Understand, Pandora?

01:04:02.843 --> 01:04:05.117
Don't give me
those googly eyes.

01:04:36.204 --> 01:04:37.987
Nice music.

01:04:38.363 --> 01:04:42.040
I'm sick of it.
Only CD that works in this car.

01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:44.804
- Go figure.
- Who is it?

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:48.924
Woody Guthrie.
Political activist folk singer.

01:04:49.014 --> 01:04:52.203
He began in the 30s.
Bob Dylan's idol.

01:04:52.613 --> 01:04:56.807
<i>Then a button-nosed kid,
as he kicked up his heel</i>

01:04:56.889 --> 01:05:00.767
<i>Said, my Daddy works
in the iron and the steel</i>

01:05:02.746 --> 01:05:06.896
<i>My Daddy makes the planes
so they fly through the sky</i>

01:05:07.013 --> 01:05:10.851
<i>That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high</i>

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.421
<i>That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high</i>

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:20.639
<i>That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high</i>

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:24.364
<i>You ain't afraid,
well neither am I</i>

01:05:24.524 --> 01:05:28.422
<i>'Cause my daddy keeps your
daddy up there so high</i>

01:05:31.548 --> 01:05:34.663
We listened to the same
records for 20 years.

01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:37.795
Brahms and Schumann.

01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:40.089
I was sick of it.

01:05:45.293 --> 01:05:47.917
To think... my kids are gone,

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:52.193
my husband left me, my mom died.
I've found my freedom.

01:05:52.742 --> 01:05:55.981
Total freedom.
I've never experienced it.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:57.725
It's extraordinary.

01:05:58.397 --> 01:06:01.837
<i>My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again</i>

01:06:02.119 --> 01:06:05.939
<i>Don't be afraid if it
gets dark and rains</i>

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:09.851
<i>My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again</i>

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:15.744
<i>My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again</i>

01:06:15.941 --> 01:06:19.620
<i>My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again</i>

01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:23.850
<i>Don't be afraid if it
gets dark and rains</i>

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:29.711
<i>My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again</i>

01:06:32.354 --> 01:06:35.785
- It's heaven here!
- Yeah, it's not bad.

01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:50.869
- Hello!
- So... Nathalie...

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:52.123
Hello.

01:07:01.478 --> 01:07:04.661
- Thanks.
- Nathalie, this is Hugo.

01:07:04.674 --> 01:07:06.310
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:09.077
- How are you doing?
- Want to see your room?

01:07:10.858 --> 01:07:12.342
It's gorgeous!

01:07:18.482 --> 01:07:24.125
This cat is unbearable. What a pain.
I really have to get rid of her.

01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:26.718
- Give her away.
- To who?

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:29.054
An old black cat.
Obese, to boot.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.968
- Would you take her?
- Not after that description.

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.429
Elsa, Nathalie...
and Clemens.

01:07:39.748 --> 01:07:41.748
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:07:42.702 --> 01:07:45.260
- Fabien speaks highly of you.
- Really?

01:07:48.099 --> 01:07:51.477
- Your husband was my teacher.
- Really?

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:54.231
I hope he didn't leave a bad memory.

01:07:55.461 --> 01:07:58.979
- He traumatized some students. Not me.
- Really?

01:08:02.174 --> 01:08:05.111
It's thanks to him I
went to study in Berlin.

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:06.779
At Humboldt.

01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:12.264
I've moved away
from his ideas now.

01:08:12.994 --> 01:08:14.796
Old-fashioned, isn't he?

01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:18.819
- It's not him who got you
into anarchism. - No.

01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:26.749
Why are you here?
I told you not to go out!

01:08:27.193 --> 01:08:29.720
Come back on the double!

01:08:29.778 --> 01:08:31.303
Pandora!

01:08:31.442 --> 01:08:32.880
Pandora!

01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:36.042
Where are you going, dummy?
Come back!

01:08:38.117 --> 01:08:42.221
- Such authority! - She's never
been out. She won't survive.

01:08:42.223 --> 01:08:44.877
Sure she will.
What about instinct?

01:08:46.616 --> 01:08:50.488
After 10 years at my mother's feet,
she mustn't have much.

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:52.840
She'll be back
once she's hungry.

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.167
Our priority has been print.

01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:57.457
But not for readers.

01:08:57.469 --> 01:08:58.885
Come back!

01:08:59.212 --> 01:09:01.019
Pandora!

01:09:03.058 --> 01:09:05.785
We've always been
against authorship.

01:09:05.868 --> 01:09:09.256
My text belong to
whoever reads them.

01:09:09.765 --> 01:09:13.591
These are dogmas we must question.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.644
If we give up anonymity,
it will be seen as betrayal.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.447
It's the starting point of our review.

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:22.955
We can't call ourselves a collective,

01:09:23.045 --> 01:09:27.173
then backtrack to re-establish
the idea of the author.

01:09:27.435 --> 01:09:30.613
If we do, we lose all credibility.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:35.291
Denying reality won't lead
to a new way of thinking.

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:37.548
We're conforming to stereotypes.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:42.675
You submit to the system you denounce,
ruled by the notion of the individual.

01:09:42.898 --> 01:09:47.520
- By signing, you don't submit?
- No, the struggle is elsewhere.

01:09:48.504 --> 01:09:50.904
- I agree with Fabian.
- Thank you.

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:56.202
By not signing our name we don't
abolish the notion of author,

01:09:56.255 --> 01:09:59.166
we draw even more
attention to ourselve'.

01:09:59.209 --> 01:10:03.482
Meanwhile, when think to benefit from
the prestige of the anti-author position...

01:10:17.385 --> 01:10:18.985
What do you say?

01:10:19.656 --> 01:10:21.254
About what?

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:23.525
Questioning authorship.

01:10:24.317 --> 01:10:26.978
Me?
Nothing.

01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:30.798
Come on.
A philosophy teacher.

01:10:37.122 --> 01:10:39.717
You know, I think I'm
too old for radicality.

01:10:41.716 --> 01:10:43.178
Why?

01:10:43.442 --> 01:10:45.388
I've than that before.

01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:48.548
I've been there.

01:10:49.442 --> 01:10:51.831
Okay.
I have changed.

01:10:52.697 --> 01:10:54.738
But the world's
just the same...

01:10:55.302 --> 01:10:57.111
...only worse.

01:11:03.195 --> 01:11:04.754
Pandora!

01:11:07.658 --> 01:11:09.207
Pandora!

01:11:26.328 --> 01:11:28.215
Pandora!

01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:36.235
There you are!

01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:43.679
I don't believe it!
A mouse!

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.791
You want a compliment?
You're filthy! Yuck!

01:11:51.864 --> 01:11:54.212
Little thug!
You'll see.

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:02.473
Here you are.
Punishment time!

01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:10.311
Raymond Aron?

01:14:27.207 --> 01:14:28.794
Damn.

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:33.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:33.751 --> 01:14:35.714
- Sleep well?
- Yes, and you?

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:46.309
- So? Did the midnight rambler come back?
- Yes, this morning.

01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:49.201
She had the nerve to
bring me a mouse.

01:14:49.279 --> 01:14:50.859
You see.

01:14:50.914 --> 01:14:53.187
- Instinct...
- Yep.

01:15:13.346 --> 01:15:16.337
I didn't know Žižek was
among your references.

01:15:17.467 --> 01:15:19.000
Isn't he fishy?

01:15:19.638 --> 01:15:23.152
I have lots of books.
I don't agree with all of them.

01:15:23.192 --> 01:15:25.234
And the Unabomber
wrote a book?

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.379
I hope you place more
value on human life.

01:15:30.813 --> 01:15:33.733
I want action to be
compactible with thought.

01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:37.150
- It isn't what you teach.
- Why do you say that?

01:15:37.937 --> 01:15:42.237
I always insisted on making
actions and thoughts compatible.

01:15:43.968 --> 01:15:47.391
- I try to practice it myself.
- Yeah, okay.

01:15:47.561 --> 01:15:51.182
- But only in the private sphere.
- How so?

01:15:52.057 --> 01:15:55.658
You don't let everyday behavior
betray your values.

01:15:55.853 --> 01:16:00.390
You don't envisage a thought system
requiring a change in your lifestyle.

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:01.931
Meaning?

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:07.597
You think demonstrations and petitions
make you a committed intellectual.

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:12.505
- Clear conscience, same lifestyle.
- You mean my bourgeois lifestyle?

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:15.772
Why not outgrow these schemas?

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.429
I think they're sterile.

01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:21.813
Because it suits you.

01:16:23.362 --> 01:16:26.148
Revolution is not my goal.
It's true.

01:16:26.191 --> 01:16:30.413
Mine is more humble.
To help kids think for themselves.

01:16:31.352 --> 01:16:34.809
We may disagree but I
thought I taught you that.

01:18:12.933 --> 01:18:15.970
Fabian, I have to go to
Paris tomorrow morning.

01:18:16.077 --> 01:18:17.617
Really?

01:18:18.211 --> 01:18:22.051
I just spoke to my super.
There's a leak at my place.

01:18:22.134 --> 01:18:23.807
Shit.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:28.593
- Sure you have to go?
- Yes, unfortunately.

01:18:47.034 --> 01:18:48.730
I'm going to bed.

01:18:48.977 --> 01:18:51.519
- I've disappointed you.
- No, no...

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:55.070
- It's not the opposite?
- Not at all.

01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:56.708
So, all's well.

01:18:56.754 --> 01:18:58.602
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:19:06.259 --> 01:19:08.494
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:14.605
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:50.150
I wasn't nice, it upsets me.
I think she took it badly.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.963
Here we are, back home.

01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:30.493
<i>One year later</i>

01:20:34.893 --> 01:20:36.574
How are you?

01:20:36.956 --> 01:20:38.751
You're here?

01:20:49.521 --> 01:20:52.880
- Can I hold him?
- Let me. I just got here.

01:20:53.471 --> 01:20:56.296
- Can you wash your hands?
- Yes.

01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:06.045
My turn.

01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:17.950
- It seems he looks like me.
- Like you?

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:20.264
You crazy?

01:21:20.296 --> 01:21:22.678
- Not at all.
- Yes, a little.

01:21:23.682 --> 01:21:26.507
- Absolutely not.
- Yes, his chin.

01:21:26.573 --> 01:21:28.504
What crap.

01:21:28.539 --> 01:21:31.102
The nonsense you
have to hear!

01:21:32.758 --> 01:21:34.304
He looks like me!

01:21:38.716 --> 01:21:41.220
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:49.390
Finally!
I thought he'd never leave.

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:55.614
You're so beautiful.
Those little hands...

01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:57.814
He's yawning!

01:21:58.054 --> 01:22:00.089
Time to go to sleep.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:06.316
What's wrong?

01:22:07.045 --> 01:22:09.524
Is it what I said
about your father?

01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:12.360
I was joking.

01:22:13.135 --> 01:22:14.729
Honey...

01:22:15.451 --> 01:22:17.375
It's no big deal.

01:22:17.921 --> 01:22:19.904
Don't cry.

01:22:21.585 --> 01:22:23.373
Talk to me.

01:22:24.965 --> 01:22:27.059
Give me back my baby.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.872
"So long as we desire,
we can do without happiness.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.233
"We expect to achieve it.

01:22:51.352 --> 01:22:54.973
"If happiness fails to come,
hope persist,

01:22:55.216 --> 01:22:59.176
"and illusion's charm lasts as
long as the passion causing it.

01:22:59.453 --> 01:23:02.121
"Thus, this condition
suffices to itself,

01:23:02.386 --> 01:23:05.493
"and the anxiety it inflicts
is a pleasure

01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:09.432
"which supplants reality,
perhaps bettering it.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:12.224
"Woe to him who has
nothing to desire!

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.472
"He loses everything he owns.

01:23:14.747 --> 01:23:18.090
"We enjoy less what we obtain
than what we desire,

01:23:18.139 --> 01:23:20.755
"and are happy only
before becoming so. "

01:23:22.332 --> 01:23:27.192
Julie is recalling her former passion,
unrequited, with Saint-Preux.

01:23:27.214 --> 01:23:32.483
She had hoped to know true bliss with him,
and this hope made her happy.

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:37.241
Julie could then be happy
substituting dream for reality.

01:23:39.254 --> 01:23:42.135
"That state sufficed unto itself. "

01:23:42.358 --> 01:23:45.195
This is the power of imagination.

01:23:45.834 --> 01:23:49.457
It compensates for the
absence of the loved one

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:52.981
with a pleasure that
is purely mental,

01:23:52.982 --> 01:23:56.967
unreal in a way,
yet nevertheless effective.

01:23:57.362 --> 01:24:01.324
For people with a lot of imagination,
like Julie, but,

01:24:01.442 --> 01:24:03.689
probably Rousseau as well,

01:24:03.724 --> 01:24:08.784
phantasmagorical satisfaction
is a real comfort

01:24:08.895 --> 01:24:13.381
that supplants, replaces,
carnal pleasure.

01:25:21.898 --> 01:25:25.069
- Staying a few days?
- No, no, just tonight.

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:47.265
Hello.
How are you?

01:25:47.692 --> 01:25:49.507
- Good, and you?
- Very good.

01:25:49.598 --> 01:25:51.408
- How was the trip?
- Fine.

01:25:51.761 --> 01:25:53.517
He's over there.

01:25:54.652 --> 01:25:56.890
- Hello.
- Hey there.

01:25:57.032 --> 01:25:58.702
- How are you?
- And you?

01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:01.076
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.

01:26:01.097 --> 01:26:03.737
- Sorry, I couldn't pick you up.
- No problem.

01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:06.358
The farmers brought us meal.

01:26:06.454 --> 01:26:09.694
I offered them a drink.
They wouldn't leave.

01:26:10.033 --> 01:26:12.730
- Can I help?
- No, go get settled.

01:26:12.756 --> 01:26:15.923
- Your room is ready.
I won't be long. - Okay.

01:26:29.702 --> 01:26:31.077
Go!

01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:36.639
Look, Pandora.
Remember?

01:26:36.742 --> 01:26:39.119
You already came once.

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:41.817
You'll love it here.

01:26:41.914 --> 01:26:44.459
- Can I see the monster?
- Under the bed.

01:26:45.516 --> 01:26:47.415
It's still okay?

01:26:47.522 --> 01:26:50.275
Adopting her is this
year's good deed.

01:26:52.446 --> 01:26:53.653
I see.

01:26:55.106 --> 01:26:57.323
We'll train you from scratch.

01:26:57.451 --> 01:27:00.825
Not too close, too soon.
She'll claw you.

01:27:01.358 --> 01:27:04.691
- We have donkeys now.
- Donkeys?

01:27:05.715 --> 01:27:07.683
What are their names?

01:27:07.746 --> 01:27:10.271
This is Faloud, the oldest.

01:27:11.382 --> 01:27:14.271
- And?
- They're Java and Omega.

01:27:14.371 --> 01:27:17.326
- None is named Cadichon?
- No.

01:27:17.804 --> 01:27:20.539
- He's fat.
- She's in foal.

01:27:21.198 --> 01:27:23.401
- Pregnant?
- Yes.

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:29.757
- Name one baby Cadichon.
- Okay, why not?

01:27:30.802 --> 01:27:32.953
I love donkeys.

01:27:33.311 --> 01:27:37.810
Remind me of my childhood. I lived
in a house with donkeys as a kid.

01:28:01.949 --> 01:28:04.074
Any plans for Christmas?

01:28:05.262 --> 01:28:07.640
Elsa and I aren't into family stuff.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.707
Want any?

01:28:11.442 --> 01:28:13.733
- Grass?
- Yes.

01:28:14.895 --> 01:28:18.951
- Should I? It's not too strong?
- I don't know. Try.

01:28:30.929 --> 01:28:32.874
Take it easy.

01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:37.742
I don't think you'll
come back to Paris.

01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:39.194
I like it here.

01:28:39.281 --> 01:28:42.730
- More time to write.
- How do you get by?

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:47.045
We teach at university in Grenoble.
And there's schoolbooks, internet.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:49.612
- Is that enough?
- For now.

01:28:50.123 --> 01:28:52.979
It'll be harder if we have a kid.

01:29:02.433 --> 01:29:03.945
And you?

01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:06.775
- Met anyone?
- "encountered person"?

01:29:06.907 --> 01:29:09.179
You're alone?
No one in your life?

01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:12.784
No... and now that
I'm grandmother...

01:29:36.424 --> 01:29:40.099
Seen my cat?
I mean, my ex-cat?

01:29:45.268 --> 01:29:47.160
You work at night?

01:29:47.367 --> 01:29:49.434
I couldn't sleep.

01:29:51.706 --> 01:29:53.298
You okay?

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:57.426
- Everything is spinning.
- Shit.

01:29:57.449 --> 01:29:59.957
I shouldn't have
let you get high.

01:30:00.398 --> 01:30:03.743
- Mind if I stay here?
- No, of course not.

01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:05.778
Lie down.

01:30:12.598 --> 01:30:15.049
- Some water?
- No, I'm okay.

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:16.640
But talk to me.

01:30:18.637 --> 01:30:20.745
What should I talk about?

01:30:20.806 --> 01:30:23.068
Talk about yourself.

01:30:23.231 --> 01:30:26.558
<i>...of the northern
wind to you</i>

01:30:26.895 --> 01:30:32.127
<i>Blue wind of
the south to you</i>

01:30:33.057 --> 01:30:38.942
<i>Pure red of the
whirling flame to you</i>

01:30:39.257 --> 01:30:45.188
<i>Pure white of the
silver moon to you</i>

01:30:45.564 --> 01:30:51.489
<i>Pure green of the
emerald grass to you</i>

01:30:51.854 --> 01:30:54.357
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.506
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:30:57.931 --> 01:31:03.878
<i>Deep peace of the
running wave to you</i>

01:31:04.298 --> 01:31:10.146
<i>Deep peace of the
flowing air to you</i>

01:31:10.553 --> 01:31:16.256
<i>Deep peace of the
quiet earth to you</i>

01:31:16.659 --> 01:31:19.081
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:19.431 --> 01:31:22.152
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:22.536 --> 01:31:25.314
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:25.671 --> 01:31:28.418
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:28.762 --> 01:31:31.762
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:35.003
<i>Deep peace</i>

01:31:43.146 --> 01:31:44.537
Nathalie?

01:31:45.324 --> 01:31:46.955
You scared me!

01:31:47.016 --> 01:31:51.031
- I was early. It was cold so I came in.
- The nerve of you!

01:31:51.207 --> 01:31:53.667
I could have been
with a lover.

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:55.580
Can you imagine?

01:31:56.684 --> 01:31:58.503
I swear...

01:31:58.751 --> 01:32:00.992
Give me back my keys.

01:32:09.345 --> 01:32:11.469
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:32:12.199 --> 01:32:15.206
Why are you here again?
Oh, yeah, Schopenhauer.

01:32:21.853 --> 01:32:23.285
Here.

01:32:23.687 --> 01:32:26.939
Thanks. I'm really glad.
I missed it.

01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:30.833
I'd ask you to stay but the
kids are coming. I'm late.

01:32:33.725 --> 01:32:36.174
I left gifts under the tree.

01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:38.465
Okay.
Thank you!

01:32:39.157 --> 01:32:41.132
What are you making?

01:32:41.504 --> 01:32:43.478
Cornish hen.

01:32:45.254 --> 01:32:47.544
With chestnuts and
mashed potatoes.

01:32:48.961 --> 01:32:51.693
- They're lucky.
- You bet they are.

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.609
Damn hen cost me a fortune.

01:32:54.856 --> 01:32:57.218
Who are you spending
Christmas with?

01:32:57.472 --> 01:33:00.765
- Your girlfriend?
- No, she's with her family in Spain.

01:33:00.927 --> 01:33:04.050
- She didn't invite you?
- Yes, but I have too much work.

01:33:04.094 --> 01:33:07.438
80 exams and I'm behind on
my translation of The Dawn.

01:33:08.357 --> 01:33:10.172
Poor guy.

01:33:11.482 --> 01:33:13.950
Spending Christmas all alone?

01:33:14.429 --> 01:33:17.282
Don't worry about me.
I'll get a good book.

01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:20.155
Some salami and wine
and I'll be fine.

01:33:20.382 --> 01:33:23.940
Now that you have your Schopenhauer,
all's well.

01:33:23.945 --> 01:33:25.379
Exactly.

01:33:29.076 --> 01:33:31.800
You should go.
I'm in the rush.

01:33:31.901 --> 01:33:34.159
I'm going, I'm going.

01:33:40.922 --> 01:33:44.720
- Give my grandson a kiss.
- You can count on me.

01:33:52.599 --> 01:33:55.384
Has anyone noticed
anything different?

01:33:57.119 --> 01:33:59.347
- Here?
- Yes, here.

01:34:00.631 --> 01:34:03.417
- New carpet?
- New hairdo?

01:34:03.712 --> 01:34:05.601
You're not very sharp.

01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:07.707
Use your heads.

01:34:08.112 --> 01:34:09.909
I don't know.

01:34:10.355 --> 01:34:11.899
I don't see.

01:34:12.198 --> 01:34:14.715
- I give up.
- Pandora!

01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:18.597
- No way!
- Pandora's gone.

01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:21.018
Found a taker?
Pay him a lot?

01:34:21.058 --> 01:34:23.589
- You could have told us.
- Seriously.

01:34:23.626 --> 01:34:26.679
- We didn't even say goodbye.
- As if you cared.

01:34:26.996 --> 01:34:30.666
- Who's the happy taker?
- Fabien, my former student.

01:34:30.713 --> 01:34:32.527
The one in the mountains.

01:34:32.623 --> 01:34:34.794
Oh, yeah, by the way...

01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:37.042
Give me your plate.

01:34:41.207 --> 01:34:42.864
For your son.

01:34:42.869 --> 01:34:45.907
- From him.
- For Leonard?

01:34:48.089 --> 01:34:50.144
- How nice.
- Can I see?

01:34:50.286 --> 01:34:51.973
- You'll thank him?
- Yes.

01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:53.229
Look.

01:34:54.006 --> 01:34:55.811
<i>The Mysteries of Plato.</i>

01:34:56.607 --> 01:35:00.240
- Not too early for philosophy?
- It's never too early!

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.385
A little.

01:35:07.393 --> 01:35:09.915
I'll go.
I prefer you eat it hot.

01:35:17.014 --> 01:35:19.007
I'll sing you a song.

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:23.032
What should I sing?

01:35:30.568 --> 01:35:33.326
<i>By the clear fountain</i>

01:35:33.397 --> 01:35:36.388
<i>As I went for a walk</i>

01:35:36.425 --> 01:35:39.345
<i>I found the water
so beautiful</i>

01:35:39.455 --> 01:35:42.229
<i>I went in to bathe</i>

01:35:42.631 --> 01:35:45.991

01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:00.038

<i>Sing, nightingale, sing</i>

01:36:13.422 --> 01:36:16.181
<i>With your carefree heart</i>

01:36:16.442 --> 01:36:19.107
