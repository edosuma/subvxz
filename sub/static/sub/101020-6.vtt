WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.637
No one is killing anyone!

00:12.721 --> 00:13.930
Is that understood?

00:14.014 --> 00:14.889
I gave you an order!

00:14.973 --> 00:15.932
No!

00:18.768 --> 00:20.186
Unbelievable.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.856
You made one hell of an accusation.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.357
All we've done is speak the truth.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.402
According to the rules of parlay,
you have to give us a chance to refute it.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.361
You already confessed.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.364
To the fact that we have werewolves
that breached your compound, yes.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.826
In search of a vast collection
of Order artifacts you now claim

00:34.909 --> 00:37.912
were stolen by a mysterious third party.
You really expect us to believe that?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.748
I expect you to give me a chance
to prove it.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.666
After all...

00:42.959 --> 00:44.586
you initiated parlay.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.382
You can try.

00:49.966 --> 00:50.800
Thank you.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.095
You can't prove it, can you?

00:54.179 --> 00:55.138
Actually...

00:56.765 --> 00:57.932
I think I can.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.026
You shouldn't have done that.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.403
You're only making things
harder for yourself.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.238
Yeah, well,
I didn't think that was possible.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.615
At least Vera got my message.

01:13.698 --> 01:14.574
You hope.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.078
Well, if she didn't,
that means this binding spell's bullshit,

01:18.161 --> 01:20.121
and I'm free to wolf out
and tear this place apart.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.081
She did.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.084
Not that it matters. You don't
really think she's gonna save us?

01:24.167 --> 01:27.253
She chose the both of us because
she's hoping the Prometheans kill us.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.006
If she wanted us dead,
she would've taken us out a long time ago.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.716
Oh, come on. Why would she kill us herself

01:31.800 --> 01:34.135
when she could sacrifice us
for the greater good?

01:34.219 --> 01:37.055
It's a win-win. We're dead,
and there's no blood on her hands.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.681
We'll have to wait and see who's right.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.809
I'd give up. Plead for mercy.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.185
Yeah, I'm sure you would.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.318
Orbin, if you think
you can trick me into surrendering

01:50.401 --> 01:52.737
because you can make Alyssa
your ventriloquist doll,

01:52.821 --> 01:54.489
we're gonna be here a long time.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.116
Alyssa's her own person, Jack.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.118
She's saying that
'cause she believes in us.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.994
-Yeah, sure she does.
- Actually, I do.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.163
You know what they make
this juice out of, right?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.164
Give that back.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.625
-I said give it to me!
- Give her the flask!

02:05.708 --> 02:06.793
No!

02:08.837 --> 02:10.296
That's cannibalism, you asshole!

02:10.380 --> 02:12.173
Stop it, you're killing him!

02:20.640 --> 02:22.725
Obrin! Look, I'm...

02:23.518 --> 02:26.479
I'm sorry about your tree thing.
I didn't mean to hurt it. I don't want to.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.190
But I will.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.736
I will rip this fucking place apart if you
don't back off and let me and Alyssa go.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.405
Ask Alyssa, she'll tell you.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.615
We already know
what you're capable of.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.076
Your fate was sealed
when you stole our magic,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.411
when you killed our friend.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.954
You have to pay for your crimes.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.956
Look, one, I did not
fucking steal anything,

02:45.039 --> 02:46.708
and two, I was defending myself.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.170
They don't believe you.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.547
-Talk to them, make them believe.
-I can't...

02:52.630 --> 02:54.090
because I don't believe you.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.677
Well, I guess we're in
for a long night, then.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.561
Okay, we need to find something
to prove Foley robbed us.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.397
How does Foley even know magic?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.566
And why does he teach it to randos?

03:13.401 --> 03:14.819
Hey. This is why.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.112
Power to the people.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.117
Sharing the wealth is so gross.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.204
My ancestors worked hard
so I wouldn't have to.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.717
Randall?

03:43.431 --> 03:44.557
He knows we're in the Order.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.857
I gotta warn Hamish.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.696
This is an enchanted plastron.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.156
It's used for lunar magic.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.952
Wait a minute.
Yeah, this was in our den.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.665
I did it.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.960
I proved Foley robbed the Order!

04:12.418 --> 04:13.503
Vera's gonna love this.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.922
-<i>You</i> proved it?
-Okay, fine, you helped, wow.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
Need the spotlight much?

04:27.141 --> 04:28.059
Orbin!

04:28.142 --> 04:31.229
I know you think that you have us trapped,
but it's the other way around.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.564
Why don't you do yourself a favor
and let us out?

04:36.150 --> 04:37.026
Orbin!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.027
He says no.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.822
Actually,

04:41.406 --> 04:42.490
he's just laughing.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.085
This tree used to be human?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.838
He's the Promethean you killed.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.385
What did they do to him?

05:02.468 --> 05:05.972
Ensured that he can still
contribute to the Common,

05:06.055 --> 05:07.598
and you almost killed him again.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.017
Well, is he gonna be all right?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.311
-Do you even care?
-I told you, I didn't mean to hurt it.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.605
You'll hurt anyone, anything,
as long as you get your way.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.898
That's all that matters to you.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.610
No, no, no, what matters to me is getting
you out of this farmer's market from Hell

05:19.694 --> 05:21.237
and back to Belgrave in one piece.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.323
I'm staying here.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.160
Hey, hey, are you okay?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.161
I'm fine.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.835
-Alyssa.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.340
What the fuck are you doing to her?

05:40.423 --> 05:41.341
That's not us.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.510
Alyssa's withdrawing from the Egregore.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.595
Jack, I need that juice.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.139
-No, you don't.
-Yes, she does.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.850
There is nothing more painful
than Egregore withdrawal.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.311
Oh, shit.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.276
<i> She's withdrawing too quickly.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:01.361
<i>Even without juice,</i>

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
<i>she should have remained connected</i>
<i>until morning.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:05.490
<i>Something's eroding her connection</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:08.117
<i>and keeping her from the Egregore.</i>

06:08.326 --> 06:09.285
<i>Something?</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:10.912
<i>Or someone?</i>

06:11.829 --> 06:13.289
<i>I can't tell, either.</i>

06:23.925 --> 06:28.388
This vault was filled
with ancient artifacts,

06:28.471 --> 06:30.807
grimoires, ritual items...

06:30.890 --> 06:34.852
Thousands of years of magic history,
traditions and knowledge,

06:35.311 --> 06:36.145
gone.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.106
Just like that.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.525
Stolen by a demon,

06:41.109 --> 06:43.111
the same demon who robbed you.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.824
All I see is an empty room.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.327
Xavier, please.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.122
I'm showing you how vulnerable we are.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
Or you're trying to deceive us.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.250
I'm telling the truth.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.793
But it's not the whole truth.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.420
Is it?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.630
I don't know what you mean.

07:03.089 --> 07:03.923
Vera...

07:05.842 --> 07:07.093
Can I call you Vera?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.470
I'm going to call you Vera.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.389
This is very simple.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.310
Your werewolf killed our colleague.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.105
All we want is vengeance.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.817
And we're going to take it from you...

07:25.445 --> 07:27.738
unless you can convince me otherwise.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.492
Whatever you think you know,
you're wrong.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.328
Uh, well...

07:34.412 --> 07:37.165
We'll learn the truth soon enough.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.634
Imagine.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.971
-This knowledge...

07:52.513 --> 07:53.931
...once belonged to the world,

07:54.640 --> 07:57.894
before powerful and selfish elite
began hoarding it,

07:57.977 --> 08:00.229
-hunting down anyone who defied them,

08:00.313 --> 08:01.731
persecuting them,

08:02.106 --> 08:03.566
sacrificing them.

08:03.649 --> 08:07.904
Joan of Arc, the Salem Witch Trials,
Helen Duncan.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.663
Praxis will rise up
against the corrupt oligarchy,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.291
and restore power to the world.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.878
Magic for the masses.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.761
Wow, that was amazing.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.180
I've seen a lot of magic acts in my life,

08:34.263 --> 08:37.975
but I've never seen one
that uses social justice as its hook.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.603
Well done. Like, really well done.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.523
That was real.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.024
Of course, totally.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.193
I didn't see the wires or anything.
I promise.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.611
Okay, time to go.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.904
No, Salvador.

08:49.987 --> 08:50.947
It's all right.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.198
Bring him here.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.453
I've seen you around. What's your name?

08:57.995 --> 09:00.373
Uh, Hamish Duke. I'm a TA for Krowchuk.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.582
A philosopher.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.501
Technically,
I'm a failed law student.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.630
But you'd consider yourself
an intellectual and educated man?

09:07.713 --> 09:08.714
I wouldn't go that far.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.343
Hm, but you're not easily fooled, though.
You need proof.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.887
Hamish.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.307
What if I told you...

09:22.311 --> 09:24.313
that inside of you...

09:27.149 --> 09:28.776
...inside of all of you...

09:31.028 --> 09:36.200
there was a beating soul
of pure energy and power,

09:36.284 --> 09:39.120
and all you had to do was accept it,

09:39.537 --> 09:40.663
to believe in it,

09:41.247 --> 09:42.248
to harness it?

09:42.331 --> 09:43.499
I'd say,

09:43.749 --> 09:44.875
"Use the force, Luke."

09:51.924 --> 09:54.051
This is going to hurt me
more than it hurts you.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.724
<i>Cuir dol air!</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:03.436
Whoa!

10:03.519 --> 10:06.314
-Amazing! That looked so real!

10:06.397 --> 10:08.399
-Wow!
-No, no, no, you idiots.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.483
It's real!

10:09.900 --> 10:13.070
Of course, guys, it's totally real.
These straps totally came out of nowhere.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.365
They definitely didn't pop out
of a secret compartment in the arm.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.161
-You're ruining everything.
-Happy to help.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.747
Next time you come at me,
don't come alone.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.916
Big hand for Professor Foley, everybody.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.162
Do you know how hard it is
to enchant a plastron?

11:03.245 --> 11:05.456
And you go and destroy it
with your dumb crest?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.124
-It's such a waste.
-It's our job.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.210
Spoiling the fun for the rest of us?

11:09.293 --> 11:10.836
Is that what you call "hunting us down?"

11:11.837 --> 11:12.755
Hm?

11:12.838 --> 11:15.299
Stabbing Hamish, torturing people?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.218
That's obligation, dumbass.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.970
Silence, subservience, observance.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.474
Remember?
You do what you're told, or else.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.811
Okay, so you were just following orders.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.606
You know that being a werewolf is magic?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.192
I prefer to think of it as "magical."

11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
Whatever gets you
through the night, sunshine.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.238
But no matter how you cut it,

11:37.321 --> 11:39.949
you're just a lousy practitioner
like the rest of us.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.494
And staring at it isn't going to make
the text come any faster.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.913
-Oh, ha! Shows what you know.

11:45.996 --> 11:46.997
Finally.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.332
Can we go now? Vera's waiting.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.251
Great, yeah. Tell her I said hi.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.794
You're not coming?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.381
-I've been waiting for you--
-Foley summoned Zecchia.

11:55.923 --> 11:59.093
He's the reason Lilith is trapped
in the demon realm.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.804
He's the guy I'm going to tear apart.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.306
If he robbed the order,
Vera's going to want to talk to him.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.976
It's not a problem.
She can talk to him after I've killed him.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.272
Trust me, you do not want to get
on Vera Stone's bad side.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.484
Okay, fine.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.446
I won't kill him
until she's talked to him.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.739
But tell her I've got dibs.

12:19.822 --> 12:20.781
Yeah, I'll let her know.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.636
Alyssa, drink this.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.139
Who are you?

12:46.348 --> 12:47.224
It's me, Jack.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.063
We fight, we kiss,
we fight, we fight, we kiss?

12:55.024 --> 12:55.900
Jack?

12:59.069 --> 13:01.238
I feel I'm drifting in and out.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.701
These voices and pieces of me,
I'm losing them.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.457
Jack, once you're connected to
the Egregore, you can't just disconnect.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.668
She has to be weaned off slowly.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.753
I need the juice, Jack.

13:15.836 --> 13:16.921
She needs more juice.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.255
Yeah, I get it!

13:18.339 --> 13:20.341
Fuck, this guy's an asshole.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.301
I can hear you
without the Egregore.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.762
I'm not giving her
any more of that damn juice.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
Hey, we'll get through this, I promise.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.767
You're always there for me Jack.
My best enemy.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.727
-I'm not your enemy.
-Then what are you?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.523
Alyssa? Alyssa!

13:41.487 --> 13:42.321
Jack!

13:42.404 --> 13:43.781
She's foaming at the mouth!

13:45.825 --> 13:48.118
We can help her,
but I need you to do something for me.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.161
-Anything.
-Surrender.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.204
Anything but that.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.373
Then whatever happens to her next
is on your hands.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.583
Look, how about I tear you apart?
Would you like that?

13:54.667 --> 13:55.501
No.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.254
And neither would Alyssa.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.383
All right. All right.

14:03.592 --> 14:07.263
<i>We have waited long enough for</i>
<i>your disciple and her irrefutable proof.</i>

14:07.346 --> 14:08.681
<i>Just bring us the binding ribbons</i>

14:08.764 --> 14:12.810
so we can end this charade and you can
face the consequences of your actions.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.862
What are you doing to my disciple?

14:23.404 --> 14:25.155
We've done nothing. She's fine.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.242
We... served shellfish for lunch.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.578
Grand Magus, I...

14:35.124 --> 14:35.958
Bad time?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.634
And Foley?

14:45.718 --> 14:46.552
Where's he?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.346
Um... Hamish lost him.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.933
So I left Randall at his house,
just in case he shows up.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.228
But don't worry, he's under strict orders
not to kill anyone.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.899
Oh, yes, 'cause we all know how compliant
these damn werewolves are.

14:59.982 --> 15:00.900
That's not enough.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.904
Uh, I, uh, took a photo of a sigil.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.659
And Hamish said Foley basically did
a whole magic show.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.911
Our kind of magic.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.330
None of this is enough to prove our case.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.751
Nothing short of a confession is going
to be good enough for the Prometheans.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.628
Find Foley. Bring him to me.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.008
At once, Grand Magus.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.351
Remember, say nothing of Alyssa
or the Egregore.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.518
I know. I know.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.481
I got your text.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.483
A little more detail
would have been helpful.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.985
Yeah, well, uh,
there wasn't enough room for

15:45.069 --> 15:48.489
"The Prometheans are bunch
of two-faced assholes" on my forehead.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.951
Did you ever consider telling me
about your previous encounters with them?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.453
You didn't ask. Listen,
the Prometheans think we robbed them,

15:54.536 --> 15:55.579
-and we didn't.
<i>-I know.</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:57.623
Your colleagues identified the culprit.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.209
Professor Cameron Foley? You know him?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.669
Yeah, my Ethics professor.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.838
All right, you guys really have
to reevaluate your hiring policies.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.592
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morton, I will
certainly take that under consideration.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.260
<i>What are you waiting for? Bring him here.</i>

16:10.344 --> 16:13.013
<i>Your friends have identified him.</i>
<i>They haven't captured him.</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:14.598
All right, well...

16:19.228 --> 16:22.481
If you need me to buy some time,
I might have a plan.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.650
Does it come with your usual body count?

16:24.733 --> 16:26.026
<i>Not if you catch Foley.</i>

16:27.528 --> 16:28.696
I'm going to surrender.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.157
That's a terrible plan,
even by your standards!

16:32.241 --> 16:33.701
<i>Well, I am guilty.</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:36.453
I mean, I didn't rob them,
but I did kill one of their guys, so...

16:36.537 --> 16:38.539
<i>If you confess to these accusations,</i>

16:38.622 --> 16:40.207
I can't protect you anymore.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.751
-You understand that, don't you?
-Yeah.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.630
I read the book, and what can I say?
Rules are rules.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.090
You have to follow them.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.139
I can't argue with that.

16:56.223 --> 17:00.185
And you do deserve to be punished
for your sins.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.105
I got to admit,
I'm of two minds on that front.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.736
You're not giving me much choice.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.279
<i>Not about choice at this point.</i>

17:10.362 --> 17:12.156
At least now they won't hurt Alyssa.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.409
After all, she had nothing to do with it.
Oh, um...

17:15.492 --> 17:17.661
I'm being told that
I have to go die now, so,

17:18.704 --> 17:19.955
I guess this is goodbye.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.166
Are you sure you want to do this?

17:22.249 --> 17:24.626
Until you have a better idea,
this is the best I can do.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.422
Well, I guess I'll see you when I see you.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.726
You're dismissed.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.062
You still have no evidence?

17:43.145 --> 17:45.939
Oh, I have plenty of evidence.
I even have a suspect.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.193
But I'm not going to waste your time
with it because you don't want proof.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.820
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.239
We came here in good faith,
seeking truth and--

17:54.323 --> 17:55.699
Cut the shit, Xavier!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.368
Jack Morton just phoned me.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.579
He confessed to murdering your colleague.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.915
There is only one reason he would give up.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.708
You were torturing Alyssa Drake!

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
I find that deeply insulting.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.588
Anything that happened to your disciple
was done to a willing participant.

18:09.671 --> 18:10.631
Can you prove it?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.967
As much as you can prove
some sinister enemy is working against us,

18:14.051 --> 18:16.845
but it doesn't matter.
Your disciple confessed. We're done.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.722
Not by a long shot.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.141
You want revenge for your colleague,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.352
but I still have the binding ribbons,

18:23.435 --> 18:27.231
and you need me to renounce my claim
on those, or you'll be digging two graves.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.108
What are you proposing?

18:29.441 --> 18:32.694
Well, you wanted to observe
the Rules of Enoch.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.489
So do I.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.451
You can have your vengeance
as long as it's served the old way.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.161
Blood atonement?

18:41.537 --> 18:44.206
Jack Morton dies by noon tomorrow...

18:45.249 --> 18:47.126
but he will die by my hand.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.089
Agreed.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.342
We'll tell our people.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.556
Now you want to kill him?

19:30.043 --> 19:31.461
Alyssa Drake has been compromised,

19:31.545 --> 19:33.797
and Jack Morton has always been
a wildcard.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.382
We should kill the Prometheans now,

19:35.465 --> 19:37.676
while they're bound to our disciples,
and clean the slate.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.304
We'd be declaring war with a group
I have no quarrel with.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.598
The Council will not approve this action.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.141
Do you see me asking for permission?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.267
You give them those ribbons

19:45.350 --> 19:47.644
and you might as well be signing
your own death warrant.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.454
Gather Council. We need to meet now.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.415
No, we can't make it brunch.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.519
This is the worst stakeout car ever.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.605
We might as well be driving a spaceship.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.233
Probably because I didn't choose it
for stakeouts.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.818
No, you chose it
because it's the most expensive.

20:39.029 --> 20:39.863
So?

20:40.447 --> 20:42.324
-He's not coming back.
-He's coming back.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.952
Guys, I ransacked the place.
There's nothing else there.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.662
There's no Order stuff,

20:46.745 --> 20:48.830
no Knights stuff.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.749
We'll find the... stuff.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.960
We better find the... stuff.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.088
What are you two morons looking for?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.089
Nothing.

20:57.965 --> 20:58.799
Fine.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.300
I don't care anyway.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.678
-You totally care.
-You care so hard.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.179
"So fucking hard."

21:04.304 --> 21:05.389
Whoa, <i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:06.723
It's why I got into psychology.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.934
That's... kind of cool.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.602
That's... not the quote.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.853
Um, what do you know?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.772
Yeah, that's, word for word, the quote.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.024
Yeah, I've seen the film
literally a million times.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.402
Yeah, it's my favorite scene.
"So fucking hard."

21:18.485 --> 21:20.237
That's pretty good.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.906
So, what makes you think he's coming back?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.325
Please, he's an adult male.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.453
There's something in there
he can't live without.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.165
It's like you two
with your precious "stuff."

21:33.292 --> 21:36.128
You did not just profile us.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.671
I totally did,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.007
and I'm totally right.

21:43.135 --> 21:43.969
Heads up.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.641
-Blitz attack?
-Blitz attack. Let's go.

21:49.725 --> 21:50.684
Uh-uh!

21:50.767 --> 21:53.729
Vera wants him alive, remember?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.199
No!

22:14.666 --> 22:15.959
Damn it!

22:17.961 --> 22:19.880
Some of these are second edition.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.142
So what happens now?

22:32.225 --> 22:34.353
We've agreed to the old ways of vengeance.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.231
Blood atonement.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.236
I read the book, but I don't remember
reading anything about this ritual.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.072
This isn't atonement.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.407
It's about something else.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.159
What do you mean, something else?

22:49.242 --> 22:50.786
The Rules of Enoch are pretty specific.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.454
If you agree to blood atonement,

22:52.537 --> 22:55.665
then I can't die until noon today,
and it has to be by Vera's hand.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.126
-Who said anything about killing you?

23:02.297 --> 23:03.215
I can't move.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.257
Relax.

23:04.341 --> 23:08.220
It's just a little restraint spell in case
you change your mind about cooperating.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.763
What the fuck are you doing to me?

23:09.846 --> 23:11.765
We're giving you a chance
to make a contribution.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.268
You're not turning me
into one of those fucking trees.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.312
Not everyone takes to the inducement,

23:17.562 --> 23:18.730
but it's our duty to try.

23:19.064 --> 23:19.940
Alyssa, help!

23:38.500 --> 23:39.876
But I don't want to leave.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.879
I don't care if he can hear me.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.097
Okay.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.486
No, no, no, no.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.759
Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
<i>Cuir baracáid air!</i>

24:35.515 --> 24:36.933
Well, that was a shitshow.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.352
I'm surprised the Order
tracked us down so quickly.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.315
What are you talking about?
It was your idea to invite Morton.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.609
Yes. It was.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.652
But, still...

24:47.736 --> 24:50.280
Right. Right. Well, what's done is done.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.990
We have to move. Here, hold this.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.867
<i>Eitil ar ais!</i>

25:06.213 --> 25:07.297
They're already here.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.341
Just hurry up.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.646
It's time to go.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.651
I'd offer you one, but...

25:28.401 --> 25:30.654
I'm sure you'd think
I was trying to poison you.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.280
Don't take it personally.

25:33.073 --> 25:33.949
More for me.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.827
That was a difficult decision you made.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.081
I'm not sure I'd be able to make it,

25:41.164 --> 25:43.083
-or go through with it.
-Well...

25:44.709 --> 25:49.130
You of all people should understand
the importance of the greater good.

25:49.923 --> 25:53.093
You are, after all, a hive mind.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.137
You figured it out.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.014
Educated guess.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.309
Xavier...

26:02.227 --> 26:03.395
what if I'm right?

26:03.478 --> 26:06.147
What if we have been targeted
by a common enemy?

26:06.231 --> 26:09.192
It makes more sense
for us to work together.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.570
Is the enemy of my enemy my friend...

26:12.153 --> 26:13.196
or my enemy?

26:14.739 --> 26:17.075
I guess that depends
on who you are in that equation.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.035
I can be your friend.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.537
Too bad you're my enemy.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.794
You know, don't take it personally.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.965
After 35 years in isolation,
everyone looks like an enemy.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.010
That is true.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.856
Woof. I'm fine.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.818
For a tourist,
the guy knows some powerful magic.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.237
Shh, quiet. He's still here.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.240
-Fan out. Search the house.
-Okay.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.492
-Someone has to take the basement. Not it.
-Not it.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.786
There's no way that counts.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.622
-Mm, totally counts.
-Wha...?

27:56.174 --> 27:57.342
Damn it.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.512
Guys, watch out for sigils
on the ceiling.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.807
Come on.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.851
<i>Apareat...</i>

28:07.936 --> 28:11.356
<i>sombulus magicus?</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:15.151
Hm.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.280
I guess magic's not
a complete waste of time.

28:23.743 --> 28:24.869
Crud.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.287
And the floor!

28:28.373 --> 28:29.499
Amateurs.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.758
<i>-Omnus sugili magici abaet.</i>

29:08.997 --> 29:11.458
Mediocre student, mediocre magician.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.090
Your people have been hoarding magic
for hundreds of years,

29:19.174 --> 29:20.967
and you're the sum of their skills?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.721
Oh, I've got skills.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.850
<i>Exi ex modesta te crudam.</i>

29:32.145 --> 29:33.480
He's down here!

29:34.439 --> 29:35.523
A little help?

29:38.526 --> 29:41.529
-Who's mediocre now, Professor?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.742
Hey, you okay?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.081
Not bad, for an acolyte.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.626
Are you kidding? I was fucking amazing.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.003
Maybe you learn to take a compliment.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.963
Whatever, Mom.
I'm trying to watch <i>The Voice.</i>

29:59.047 --> 30:00.006
What was that?

30:00.924 --> 30:03.259
Whoa, okay.
Yeah, she hit her head pretty bad.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.679
Get Foley to Vera. I'll take care of her.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.766
Let's go, "Professor of the Year."

30:26.866 --> 30:29.244
Never seen anyone
take to the inducement so quickly.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.121
Must be the werewolf in you.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.374
Please just make it stop.

30:36.626 --> 30:37.836
Take a deep breath.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.756
This is gonna hurt.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.486
No. No. No.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.659
Stop it! You're killing him!

31:30.263 --> 31:31.431
Hey. Jack.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.141
Jack, can you hear us?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.393
Jack.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.690
What's so funny?

31:40.773 --> 31:42.358
I was thinking, if...

31:43.443 --> 31:45.278
Lilith was here right now here,
she would...

31:46.321 --> 31:48.281
rip out his heart and feed it to him.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.951
Yeah, she probably would.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.287
If I'd just held on a little longer...

31:55.830 --> 31:56.956
pulled a little harder--

31:57.040 --> 31:58.499
Jack, it wasn't your fault.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.544
It wasn't your fault.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.466
Maybe this is my punishment.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.260
For Pops...

32:10.386 --> 32:11.220
and Lilith...

32:14.223 --> 32:15.141
and you.

32:16.976 --> 32:18.353
You should have left me behind.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.730
You always tell me what to do.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.233
And you still can't follow orders.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.027
I hate myself...

32:27.612 --> 32:29.197
for screwing everything up.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.533
I pushed you away.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.035
You didn't have another choice.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.205
But all...

32:37.830 --> 32:39.332
All I wanted...

32:42.752 --> 32:45.421
You're the only one...

32:47.423 --> 32:49.550
that made me want to live my own life.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.848
Couldn't figure that out sooner?

33:00.061 --> 33:02.063
I'm so sorry, Alyssa.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.069
I'm sorry, too.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.228
<i>It's our way, Alyssa.</i>

33:42.311 --> 33:43.354
<i>A life for a life.</i>

33:43.980 --> 33:46.399
<i>The Order took one of ours,</i>
<i>the Order must give one of theirs.</i>

33:46.899 --> 33:48.067
He made a mistake.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.321
Please, Orbin, your people will listen
to you. You can make this stop.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.492
<i>Have some juice.</i>
<i>You'll feel better.</i>

34:02.331 --> 34:03.583
You'll regret that later.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.709
I already do.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.298
<i> I don't understand.</i>

34:10.631 --> 34:13.384
<i>She seems like she wants to be here,</i>
<i>but she's not connecting.</i>

34:14.886 --> 34:15.720
<i> Forget her.</i>

34:15.803 --> 34:17.180
<i>She served her purpose.</i>

34:17.472 --> 34:18.848
<i> Welcome home, Xavier.</i>

34:19.265 --> 34:20.349
<i>Gather everyone.</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:22.018
<i>It's time.</i>

35:06.020 --> 35:07.814
Now spill his blood on the soil.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.818
End his pain,

35:11.901 --> 35:13.402
and complete the atonement.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.075
I know how you feel.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.618
I do.

35:20.743 --> 35:22.495
I've known Jack Morton for over a year...

35:23.663 --> 35:25.540
and I want to kill him
at least once a week.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.626
But we are not here
because of Jack Morton.

35:28.709 --> 35:32.213
We are here because a common enemy
seeks to destroy us both,

35:32.296 --> 35:35.675
and if we don't stop now
before it's too late, he will succeed.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.301
You're stalling again.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.386
I'm not stalling.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.720
I'm negotiating.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.850
I'm proposing an alliance.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.726
We have both been attacked,

35:46.394 --> 35:48.938
and our assailant is trying to convince us
to blame each other.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.064
Stories.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.357
Look at him.

35:52.024 --> 35:55.361
Do you think he would confess to murder,
and not the robbery?

36:02.743 --> 36:04.954
Jack Morton is willing to surrender
his life for Alyssa.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.539
Give me the chance to do the same.

36:06.622 --> 36:09.709
You want our secrets,
don't waste your time with Alyssa Drake.

36:10.626 --> 36:11.502
Read my mind.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.639
Um... You...

36:28.311 --> 36:29.187
Drink this.

36:29.937 --> 36:30.855
All of it.

36:31.105 --> 36:31.939
Magus, don't!

36:32.023 --> 36:33.983
Give us your mind and everything within.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.163
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

36:47.914 --> 36:48.873
<i>Yes.</i>

36:49.540 --> 36:51.042
<i>And now you can hear me.</i>

36:54.587 --> 36:55.963
<i>Miseriam sempiternam!</i>

37:09.101 --> 37:10.645
<i>What have you done?</i>

37:11.270 --> 37:14.065
<i>I mixed an emotional amplifier</i>
<i>in my pina colada.</i>

37:14.148 --> 37:17.860
<i>Now every moment of pain in my life</i>
<i>is screaming into your mind.</i>

37:17.944 --> 37:19.445
<i>How can you bear this?</i>

37:20.655 --> 37:24.158
<i>I bear it</i>
<i>because I already lived it.</i>

37:25.368 --> 37:28.329
A group of people we've never
even heard of robbed us blind.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.997
Do you see that I believe that?

37:35.294 --> 37:37.630
We must adapt, we must evolve,

37:38.130 --> 37:39.507
or we are doomed.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.218
In accordance to the Rules of Enoch,

37:42.301 --> 37:44.136
I offer you my weapon in friendship.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.819
I offer you my weapon in friendship.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.113
<i>Exsolvatur!</i>

38:10.746 --> 38:12.039
I need an address.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.962
Ladies and gentlemen...

38:19.422 --> 38:21.674
may I present Cameron Foley,

38:22.466 --> 38:25.553
mediocre Ethics professor,
and the man who stole your magic.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.889
You see, that right there is your problem.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.933
"Me," "Mine," "Ours"...

38:31.017 --> 38:33.853
Magic isn't something to be possessed,
not anymore.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.479
You're too late.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.356
We've already won.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.899
Should I put the gag back on?

38:38.983 --> 38:41.027
And I won "Professor of the Year" in '09.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.737
-That was at a community college.
-Wow.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.155
I know what he knows,

38:44.572 --> 38:46.324
where he's hidden our artifacts.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.659
How will you know
we're telling you the truth?

38:48.743 --> 38:49.577
I'll know.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.538
It is a shame
that it has come to this.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.749
Now, you remember,
whatever happens next is on you.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.834
Now, you still have time
to make this right.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.337
You let me go,
and I will spare your lives.

38:59.837 --> 39:00.671
Hm?

39:06.218 --> 39:07.636
Let's go-- Okay, all right.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.847
We do have a common enemy.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.224
Mm. Apology accepted.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.560
-I didn't--
-Now let my disciple go.

39:19.607 --> 39:20.524
Where is Jack?

39:31.660 --> 39:33.204
These look longer to you?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.040
That was a big risk you took.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.418
There was no guarantee
your friends would find Foley in time.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.170
Well, I have faith in my friends.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.464
I'm complimenting you, Mr. Morton.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.592
That was a Magus-level strategy
you devised.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.677
I always knew you had potential.

39:48.761 --> 39:49.595
Yeah.

39:50.137 --> 39:53.891
My ability to turn into a tree really
sets me apart from the other disciples.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.893
There's a lot more to you than you think.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.314
Like what?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.277
Well, for centuries,

40:05.736 --> 40:07.321
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose

40:07.405 --> 40:09.865
has been awaiting
the fulfillment of a prophecy,

40:10.324 --> 40:12.952
of a chosen one to lead them
from the darkness,

40:13.035 --> 40:15.538
and I think that you, Jack Morton,

40:16.122 --> 40:17.498
are that chosen one.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.503
You just told a joke.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.715
In college, I was the treasurer
of my improv troupe.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.677
I selected you

40:29.760 --> 40:34.181
because you have a value system
forged by something other than privilege.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.226
So I am <i>a</i> chosen one.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.854
It's getting late.
Finish your potion so we can get going.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.198
I'm not sure what's worse,
the transformation or the antidote.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.493
Just anything to end
this abominable mental connection.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.038
-Yeah, look, about that, I was gonna say--
-Don't ruin the moment, Mr. Morton.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.790
Last thing I need is your pity.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.003
I'm sorry about your daughter.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.145
You moved me?

41:21.228 --> 41:23.022
What if I had a spinal injury?

41:23.105 --> 41:24.732
You could've crippled me, idiot.

41:24.815 --> 41:25.858
Why do you do that?

41:26.108 --> 41:27.610
-Do what?
-Deflect.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.321
Back off, Dr. Phil. I do not deflect.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.238
There you go again.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.492
-Here.

41:40.748 --> 41:41.749
So...

41:43.626 --> 41:44.960
did you kill Foley?

41:46.712 --> 41:48.172
Hamish took him to Vera.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.676
Look, I'm fine.

41:53.886 --> 41:54.720
You can go.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.263
I'm not going anywhere.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.224
Why are being so nice to me?

41:59.767 --> 42:02.019
I need a reason to be nice to you?

42:02.102 --> 42:03.437
Everybody wants something.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.980
What you did today,

42:05.606 --> 42:06.774
for me and Hamish...

42:08.275 --> 42:09.193
That was legit.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.197
Thanks for having our backs.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.286
You know, just because I saved your ass
doesn't make us BFF's.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.288
It doesn't make us not BFF's.

42:22.414 --> 42:23.582
Okay, let's go.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.750
Where are we going?

42:25.167 --> 42:26.001
The den.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.503
-That shithole?
-Yep.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.546
What for?

42:28.629 --> 42:33.008
I'm going to introduce you
to a little tradition called <i>"après-</i>kill".

42:33.092 --> 42:34.009
You play foosball?

42:34.093 --> 42:36.011
Are you kidding? I'm a total legend.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.012
Oh, sick.

42:51.318 --> 42:53.362
You know,
you're more than welcome to stay.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.240
I know I am, but, uh...

42:56.740 --> 42:57.616
I won't.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.368
Pick it up, Miss Drake.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.494
Gabrielle helped you?

43:00.578 --> 43:02.329
Not just helped, she saved the day.

43:03.205 --> 43:04.331
Gabrielle Dupres?

43:04.748 --> 43:05.666
I know, right?

43:11.213 --> 43:12.298
Oh, my God.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.595
We have to help them.

43:42.077 --> 43:42.995
Holy shit.

43:44.997 --> 43:45.831
Foley.

43:45.914 --> 43:46.790
Midnight.
