00:04.213 --> 00:05.923
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:08.383 --> 00:11.887
I want to thank all of you for attending
this preview of my upcoming show.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.723
Actually,
I do prefer to call it a reception...

00:14.806 --> 00:18.602
because, as you can see,
there are some people...

00:18.935 --> 00:22.481
who have just arrived,
and I do want you to meet them.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.735
It's quite possible
that you have met some of them before...

00:26.818 --> 00:28.862
at some time or another because...

00:28.945 --> 00:31.573
they come from all walks of life...

00:32.031 --> 00:33.825
all marches of time.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.829
They are those members of humanity
at perhaps whom...

00:37.913 --> 00:41.249
you have always wished to stare.
Or examine.

00:41.625 --> 00:46.546
Or scrutinize, in an attempt to experience
what it's like to live their lives.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.675
You won't be sorry you came with me.
Even if it did take six phone calls.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.926
Seven.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.887
Wait till you see this guy's work.

00:53.970 --> 00:57.015
I'm doing a term paper
on the Henry Roberts statues.

00:57.098 --> 01:01.478
So far I've just seen pictures of them,
but now I get to see them up close.

01:02.937 --> 01:06.107
They're so realistic
they will blow your socks off.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.904
And may I suggest, "Here we Stand. "

01:11.654 --> 01:12.989
Gentlemen?

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.379 --> 01:30.006
They look so real.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.550
Look at the detail!

01:32.633 --> 01:35.178
The hair, the fingernails, the wrinkles.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.306
Yet these are statues, Diana.
Can you believe it?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.309
He is a genius.

01:46.272 --> 01:50.067
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite all right. No harm done.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.241
Not even a dent.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.994
Mr. Roberts, I've got to know
how you make these statues.

02:00.077 --> 02:02.580
And I'm afraid
I have got to keep that a secret.

02:02.663 --> 02:04.915
But I'm doing a term paper
on your statues...

02:04.999 --> 02:08.085
Harold,
I don't think that's going to impress him.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.851
Bingo.

03:53.398 --> 03:56.735
Of course, it's because they are so lifelike
that critics put them down.

03:56.818 --> 04:00.238
Art seeks to interpret life,
not merely to imitate it.

04:00.321 --> 04:03.074
Harold, I've enjoyed the art lecture
but I've got to go.

04:03.158 --> 04:07.412
Surely you won't leave now, when
we've finally had a chance to talk, Ms...

04:07.495 --> 04:09.372
Prince. Diana Prince.

04:09.456 --> 04:13.751
And I really do have to go.
I found your work so intriguing...

04:13.835 --> 04:15.879
that I'm 15 minutes late already.

04:15.962 --> 04:19.298
You stay and talk.
I'll get the car and bring it around.

04:19.382 --> 04:22.552
Butter him up.
Try to make him tell you his technique.

04:23.428 --> 04:24.721
Harold?

04:27.015 --> 04:28.224
I drove.

04:32.061 --> 04:33.771
Car's in the shop.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.776
Tell me...

04:39.569 --> 04:42.697
is Senator Farnum's son
your usual escort?

04:43.573 --> 04:46.826
There are many words I could use
to describe Harold.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.912
"Usual" is by no means one of them.

05:00.548 --> 05:03.926
Excuse me, but I know for a fact
that this isn't your car.

05:04.051 --> 05:07.555
Well, one of us made a mistake. You.

05:09.223 --> 05:10.850
Hey, look.

05:13.602 --> 05:17.106
Start marching. Come on.
Go to the left. Go.

05:19.316 --> 05:22.611
Whatever you plan to do with me,
you're not gonna get away with it.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.280
I know Diana Prince.

05:24.363 --> 05:26.615
She's not gonna like
what you did to her car.

05:26.699 --> 05:29.535
Or whatever you plan do to me.
You hear me?

05:34.874 --> 05:36.792
Harold, you chump.

05:38.961 --> 05:42.965
Some guy pulled a gun on Harold Farnum
and left a poem in your car?

05:43.340 --> 05:46.802
"One of several missing treasures
Number nine as of today

05:46.885 --> 05:50.639
"Find the method to this madness
For I'm soon to steal away"

05:51.473 --> 05:54.184
Real catchy. Has Ira taken a look at this?

05:54.643 --> 05:58.772
He scanned it for fingerprints,
tried to trace those letters, nothing.

05:59.982 --> 06:03.610
Well, one thing we know for sure
is that whoever left this in your car...

06:03.694 --> 06:06.196
has been stealing art objects
and wants to brag about it.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.782
What is this glass bowl?
Have you checked it out?

06:08.866 --> 06:10.742
It's a famous Hollenbeck crystal.

06:10.826 --> 06:14.913
It was stolen about two weeks ago
from a private collector in Alexandria.

06:15.247 --> 06:18.375
But Ira did come up with a list of names...

06:19.626 --> 06:22.754
- people who might know where it is.
- A list of fences?

06:23.130 --> 06:27.509
He says our most likely candidate is
one Shubert Goring, down on St. Paul.

06:27.676 --> 06:30.887
I'll give him your regards
if the charade that I'm gonna play works.

06:30.971 --> 06:33.974
Wait a minute, Diana.
We could let the police handle this.

06:34.057 --> 06:37.477
Yes, but we were the ones
who were tipped off to these robberies.

06:37.561 --> 06:40.313
Not the police, not the FBl, but us.

06:41.022 --> 06:43.024
That's exactly what worries me.

06:44.568 --> 06:47.988
Well, don't let it worry you.
I can take care of myself.

07:12.512 --> 07:14.556
Looks like a garage sale.

07:15.223 --> 07:17.350
Hey, Harv, how are you?

07:18.059 --> 07:20.228
All right. Looking good.

07:22.730 --> 07:24.899
Use the three iron. Better.

07:26.025 --> 07:29.946
Hello, how are you? Don't bother, fellas.
I can manage myself.

07:38.204 --> 07:41.416
Well, Diana Prince got her message.
No thanks to that Farnum kid.

07:41.499 --> 07:44.794
- He ID'd you?
- No big deal.

07:46.921 --> 07:51.426
Maybe it's a good thing that you'll be
on field assignment as of this afternoon.

07:51.926 --> 07:54.429
- Usual bonus?
- $15,000.

07:55.888 --> 07:57.640
What am I this time?

07:57.723 --> 08:00.893
You are a disgruntled housepainter.

08:02.353 --> 08:04.522
What about the N.I.M. unit?

08:05.273 --> 08:08.067
Built into these glasses. Here, see.

08:10.236 --> 08:11.737
This should work.

08:15.658 --> 08:17.034
Very nice.

08:18.327 --> 08:19.745
Study this.

08:21.539 --> 08:22.915
$15,000.

08:33.884 --> 08:35.719
Somebody's out front.

08:36.761 --> 08:39.347
They're asking about the Hollenbeck bowl.

08:40.265 --> 08:42.726
- Police?
- No. Some lady.

08:43.102 --> 08:44.311
Yes, but...

09:02.955 --> 09:05.874
Incredible how lifelike she is, isn't it?

09:08.627 --> 09:12.923
I'm not really into statues, Mr. Goring.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.301
I'm into crystal. As in...

09:17.970 --> 09:19.429
Hollenbeck.

09:21.098 --> 09:23.976
My employer is ready to pay you...

09:24.768 --> 09:28.563
$85,000 to take it off your hands.

09:29.648 --> 09:33.110
His name is Bob Bertilucci.

09:33.735 --> 09:37.114
Mr. Bertilucci's fondness for fine art
is well known.

09:38.115 --> 09:41.201
What is not well known
is that he went into hiding...

09:41.284 --> 09:43.662
in Brazil five months ago.

09:44.204 --> 09:47.124
You should see his phone bills. I have.

09:48.416 --> 09:52.295
Let me see the crystal, Mr. Goring.
Or are you going to tell me...

09:53.213 --> 09:55.173
that you don't have it?

09:55.757 --> 09:58.176
I'll see what I can do. Excuse me.

10:11.064 --> 10:14.359
- There's something funny about that girl.
- I agree.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.655
- Then why are you getting the bowl out?
- Why not?

10:19.239 --> 10:21.950
After all, the poor girl is going to have...

10:22.033 --> 10:24.702
such a terrible accident on her way home.

10:31.626 --> 10:34.087
The crystal! It's been stolen!

10:34.879 --> 10:36.714
Stolen? From you?

10:37.757 --> 10:41.511
- You're a fence!
- What is the world coming to?

11:20.716 --> 11:21.842
Up.

11:24.178 --> 11:25.888
Wait, she's coming down.

11:28.224 --> 11:31.644
Diana Prince is making a phone call.
To the police, I think.

12:02.091 --> 12:04.259
- Come on, man.
- I'm trying.

12:13.018 --> 12:14.478
If you insist.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.993
You know what this means, don't you?

12:30.953 --> 12:33.956
You're going to have to walk
to the police station.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.510
Surprise.

12:48.303 --> 12:52.599
- Happy birthday, my sweet.
- Tad, oh, Taddie.

12:52.974 --> 12:55.435
An original Henry Roberts statue.

12:55.727 --> 12:58.146
I've wanted one ever so long.

12:58.230 --> 13:02.484
I commissioned Henry Roberts personally.
I gave him exact specifications.

13:03.902 --> 13:06.655
Doesn't it look a bit familiar?

13:08.949 --> 13:11.493
- Why, it's Mr. Bancroft.
- Right.

13:11.993 --> 13:13.495
That's just how he looked...

13:13.578 --> 13:17.040
when I made him do the living room over
for the fourth time.

13:17.999 --> 13:21.628
- He never did get the color right.
- Don't you like it?

13:22.837 --> 13:24.798
I adore it, Taddie.

13:25.507 --> 13:28.718
This will be a birthday
I shall never forget.

13:35.892 --> 13:38.394
Ira, is this the list you promised me?

13:38.478 --> 13:42.106
Affirmative. It describes 10 art objects,
including the bowl...

13:42.190 --> 13:46.235
all of which were stolen
under suspiciously similar circumstances.

13:47.862 --> 13:51.741
In each case, there were
no windows broken, no locks destroyed...

13:52.200 --> 13:54.535
no sign of forcible entry at all.

13:54.619 --> 13:57.413
Each case would indicate an inside job.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.085
Ira, have you been watching
gangster movies again?

14:02.168 --> 14:05.505
Of course not. Only Kojak reruns.

14:09.842 --> 14:14.555
Looks like the same M.O. was used
to steal a painting of a lion worth $90,000.

14:15.056 --> 14:19.769
A statue of a goat worth $75,000,
a modern art piece, another sculpture.

14:21.145 --> 14:23.564
- Here's another one.
- Affirmative.

14:23.648 --> 14:27.026
It is advisable
that you investigate the tenth theft...

14:27.109 --> 14:30.404
that of the ram medallion,
which occurred last night.

14:30.488 --> 14:32.990
Ira, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

14:33.074 --> 14:35.493
Now here's another word for you. "Bye. "

15:02.436 --> 15:03.812
Good afternoon, Mr. Roberts.

15:03.896 --> 15:06.815
I still have no intention of telling you
how I make my statues.

15:06.899 --> 15:09.109
You don't have to.
I've figured out the materials-

15:09.193 --> 15:10.277
I don't care.

15:10.361 --> 15:13.572
- At least listen and tell me if I'm close-
- What is wrong with you?

15:13.655 --> 15:18.285
You seem to speak English, but you do not
seem to understand it. I'll not tell you.

15:19.161 --> 15:20.537
Hold on a second.

15:23.916 --> 15:26.460
I'm doing a term paper on your statues!

15:29.254 --> 15:32.758
- What a pain in the-
- Now, now, Henry.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.346
Mr. Farnum's persistence
is not to be discouraged.

15:37.888 --> 15:41.350
Had he not insisted that Diana Prince
accompany him to your opening...

15:41.433 --> 15:43.435
we wouldn't be running ahead of schedule.

15:43.518 --> 15:47.314
Do you know how many telephone calls
I ignored from him yesterday?

15:47.397 --> 15:50.859
- Ten.
- I believe his record is 14.

15:53.028 --> 15:55.947
I take it you have acquired
the ram medallion?

15:57.365 --> 15:58.950
How much do we fence it for?

15:59.034 --> 16:03.121
It's worth $100,000, so start at $75,000.
Go no less than $60,000.

16:03.747 --> 16:07.500
- Epperly will take care of it.
- Three more days, Henry...

16:08.126 --> 16:12.631
and then no art piece we acquire
will be anything less than priceless.

16:33.234 --> 16:34.736
My birthday.

16:34.819 --> 16:39.157
Of all the days some dreadful person
could have picked to ruin my life.

16:39.949 --> 16:44.787
We paid $7,428
to install an alarm system in here...

16:45.038 --> 16:47.874
and we heard absolutely nothing
last night.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.004
I never thought I'd hear myself
badmouth the free enterprise system...

16:53.087 --> 16:55.798
but it does give you pause, doesn't it?

16:56.007 --> 16:58.676
Well, what does really give me pause...

16:58.760 --> 17:01.262
is that out of a whole room
of expensive objects...

17:01.346 --> 17:04.140
the ram medallion was the only thing
that was stolen.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.893
It was your cousin Marvin. He stole it.

17:07.685 --> 17:11.606
- He always had his eye on that medallion.
- Now, now, pumpkin.

17:11.689 --> 17:13.773
Please forgive her. She's very upset.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.611
- Yesterday was-
- Her birthday, yes, I know.

17:21.616 --> 17:24.952
Hello? Yes, I suppose.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.540
- It's for you.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.045
You'd think
we were running an answering service.

17:35.963 --> 17:38.049
- Hi, Diana.
- Got anything?

17:38.132 --> 17:39.800
What I've got are no fingerprints...

17:39.884 --> 17:44.305
no broken locks or windows and
no $100,000 medallion. How about you?

17:44.430 --> 17:47.767
Well, you know those men that
Wonder Woman brought in? Goring's men?

17:47.850 --> 17:50.269
- Yeah.
- One of them made a deal with the police.

17:50.352 --> 17:54.523
Fingered a man that he's pretty sure
is gonna fence the stolen art objects.

17:55.232 --> 17:59.361
His name is Carmichael Goodman.
Runs an art supply store down on Gaylord.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.907
Could be our thief will try to
get the medallion to Goodman today.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.367
- You better keep an eye on him.
- Will do.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.994
Diana, by the way...

18:07.077 --> 18:10.414
Harold Farnum tried to call you
eight times this morning.

18:10.497 --> 18:15.044
- That's nothing. His record is 14.
- I believe it.

18:16.336 --> 18:19.173
- I'll talk to you later, Steve.
- All right. Bye.

18:22.676 --> 18:24.553
Well, Mr. Goodman...

18:25.512 --> 18:28.056
you are about to grow another shadow.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.622
Looking for Mr. Goodman?

19:37.292 --> 19:38.501
Hold it!

19:44.048 --> 19:45.967
Stay put, Mr. Goodman.

20:02.233 --> 20:05.320
I'm in trouble.
Give me five seconds, then freeze me.

20:44.817 --> 20:46.986
Col. Trevor.

20:47.069 --> 20:50.656
- Harold Farnum. We met once, last year.
- Oh, yes.

20:51.615 --> 20:54.869
- How did you get up here?
- They gave me clearance downstairs.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.538
I told them
I'm doing a little business for my father.

20:57.621 --> 21:00.332
I see. Well, Diana isn't here.

21:00.416 --> 21:03.544
I know. I've been trying to reach her
since 8:00 this morning.

21:03.627 --> 21:05.880
Why don't you leave a note for her
downstairs?

21:05.963 --> 21:09.425
I came about something else.
Look at this, Colonel.

21:11.969 --> 21:13.053
"Romulus and Remus. "

21:14.388 --> 21:17.016
Two Roberts statues
commissioned by the Italian Government?

21:17.099 --> 21:20.310
I don't see what this has to do
with the IADC.

21:20.394 --> 21:21.979
That's not the point.

21:23.439 --> 21:26.734
You see, I'm doing a term paper
on Henry Roberts' statues.

21:28.193 --> 21:29.570
Try the library.

21:29.653 --> 21:32.489
No, I'm trying to find out
exactly what they're made of.

21:32.573 --> 21:35.409
- Then ask Henry Roberts.
- I have, believe me.

21:35.492 --> 21:39.997
I wanna take all the information I have,
like the picture of the twins here.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.375
I got the picture of the fisherman.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.420
This is the lady reading a book.
Have you seen any of these?

21:46.503 --> 21:47.629
Yes, I've seen them.

21:47.713 --> 21:51.550
I wanna take all the information
I've gathered, feed it into your computer...

21:51.633 --> 21:54.678
and see if he can come up
with what they're made of.

21:55.012 --> 21:58.098
- You want to use the computer?
- Yeah.

21:58.181 --> 21:59.891
That's impossible.

22:02.894 --> 22:06.064
But Diana said
that Ira could figure it out in no time.

22:09.276 --> 22:12.487
- Harold, get off my back.
- What is that?

22:13.697 --> 22:16.575
That's our roving computer module.
Excuse me.

22:21.788 --> 22:23.790
- Thanks, Rover.
- Don't mention it.

22:23.873 --> 22:26.751
- Computer module? Hold on a second.
- Rover?

22:28.086 --> 22:29.546
Anything else?

22:29.629 --> 22:32.632
Rover, this is Harold Farnum.
Senator Farnum's son.

22:32.716 --> 22:35.593
I have a feeling we'll be seeing
a lot of him around here.

22:35.677 --> 22:39.597
I'd like to have you commit
his voice pattern to your memory circuit.

22:40.098 --> 22:41.891
Say something, Harold.

22:44.144 --> 22:46.771
Hi, Rover. What do you say?

22:50.567 --> 22:53.278
- What did he say?
- No telling.

22:54.863 --> 22:57.365
Getting back to the I.R.A.C. computer...

22:57.866 --> 23:01.119
I'm afraid IADC policy strictly forbids it.

23:01.202 --> 23:04.372
But I know all about computers.
I took a course last semester.

23:04.455 --> 23:06.666
Keypunch, you name it. I know it all.

23:06.749 --> 23:10.753
Harold, that's not the point.
The point is, it costs approximately...

23:10.837 --> 23:13.589
$100 per minute for even me to use it.

23:13.673 --> 23:18.010
I couldn't possibly justify you using it
to research a term paper, could I?

23:19.971 --> 23:23.641
I guess not. Well, thanks, Col. Trevor.

23:23.975 --> 23:25.434
Harold, I'm sorry.

23:25.518 --> 23:29.897
Listen, I'll tell Diana that you were in
to see her. She'll be delighted.

23:29.981 --> 23:31.399
Thanks.

23:38.322 --> 23:40.199
Delighted she missed you.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.001
Rover.

23:54.755 --> 23:57.675
- This is Harold Farnum.
- I know.

23:57.758 --> 24:02.012
- Take me to the I.R.A.C. computer. Got it?
- The I.R.A.C. computer?

24:02.096 --> 24:06.475
- Yes, take me to the I.R.A.C. computer.
- Okay, follow me.

24:13.941 --> 24:16.568
- The computer is in here?
- That's right.

24:17.611 --> 24:20.030
Thanks, Rover.
I'll return the favor someday.

24:20.114 --> 24:21.824
Don't mention it.

24:53.939 --> 24:56.817
I guess there's only one thing
left for me to do.

25:37.732 --> 25:40.610
Sorry to take my problems
out on you, buddy...

25:40.694 --> 25:44.364
but if I don't get an A on that term paper,
I'll never pledge Pi Chi Psi.

25:44.447 --> 25:48.660
The only way to get an A is to find out
exactly how you guys are put together.

25:48.743 --> 25:52.664
And since nobody will tell me,
I'll have to do my own little analysis.

25:52.747 --> 25:56.125
I wonder what kind of surgery
Marcus Welby would call this.

26:03.466 --> 26:06.427
I didn't... I was just... How did you do...

26:07.470 --> 26:09.973
I'll just be leaving, if it's all right.

26:25.988 --> 26:28.157
Nothing. Another dead end.

26:28.699 --> 26:31.327
All Carmichael Goodman could tell
Wonder Woman was...

26:31.410 --> 26:35.540
that he was going to try to fence
the medallion for a man named Ed Epperly.

26:35.623 --> 26:37.291
The man who got away.

26:37.375 --> 26:41.629
I had him checked out with the police
and came up with a big, fat zero.

26:42.964 --> 26:45.716
- So here we are back at square one.
- Correction.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.011
Here you are at square one.
Me, I'm going home.

26:50.137 --> 26:53.557
Somehow, a nice, quiet, boring evening...

26:53.641 --> 26:56.310
in front of the TV
sounds awfully good right now.

26:56.394 --> 26:59.313
- Yeah. I know the feeling.
- Good night.

29:27.752 --> 29:28.920
Now.

30:18.552 --> 30:22.139
The lab boys are gonna have to
do something about your sneak attacks.

30:22.223 --> 30:23.891
Sorry about that.

30:24.934 --> 30:27.895
- You got my coffee?
- I forgot the coffee.

30:28.145 --> 30:30.105
Well, what do you have?

30:31.440 --> 30:33.233
From Ira, I take it.

30:37.196 --> 30:40.282
"The I.R.A.C. computer must speak
with Steve Trevor. "

30:41.450 --> 30:44.995
Tell your boss I'll be in
right after I finish a few things here.

30:45.079 --> 30:49.041
- Now. He wants to see you now.
- Well, go on. Tell him.

30:53.879 --> 30:57.758
I'll just bet Ira programmed you
not to move unless I came with you.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.676
You guessed it.

31:05.641 --> 31:08.894
I'm gonna have a real long talk
with those lab boys.

31:20.489 --> 31:23.450
- Okay, Ira. What do you got?
- Good morning, Steve Trevor.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.994
For some reason, I haven't had
my coffee this morning...

31:26.077 --> 31:28.955
so let's dispense with the pleasantries,
get down to business.

31:29.039 --> 31:30.540
A matter of great importance...

31:30.624 --> 31:34.544
has been called to the attention
of the I.R.A. C. computer by POLISY.

31:34.836 --> 31:37.714
- By who?
- The Police Intelligence System.

31:38.006 --> 31:40.926
Its computer has recorded
another art theft.

31:41.009 --> 31:42.093
Where?

31:42.177 --> 31:46.222
A solid gold statue worth $125,000...

31:46.306 --> 31:49.184
Was stolen last night
from the Putney Museum.

31:49.267 --> 31:51.394
Same M.O. as the other thefts, I take it?

31:51.478 --> 31:54.522
No broken Windows,
no signs of forced entry.

31:54.606 --> 31:56.191
Must be an inside job.

31:56.274 --> 31:59.986
Have you been Watching
gangster movies again, Steve Trevor?

32:00.403 --> 32:01.988
Very funny.

32:03.239 --> 32:05.533
I better get Diana over there right away.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.952
You took the words right out of my mouth.

32:08.036 --> 32:10.538
You don't have a mouth. Goodbye.

32:13.541 --> 32:17.545
And as for you, coffee, cream, no sugar,
five minutes.

32:18.546 --> 32:20.673
And a half a grapefruit.

33:02.089 --> 33:04.091
What did you do to me?

33:04.300 --> 33:08.846
Suspended your animation, Mr. Farnum.
Electronically and most effectively.

33:09.055 --> 33:12.683
All of Henry's so-called statues are,
as you are about to discover...

33:12.767 --> 33:14.769
flesh and blood individuals...

33:14.852 --> 33:18.105
delicately frozen
by a minute stream of electrons...

33:18.189 --> 33:21.150
controlled by a neuro-impulse modulator...

33:21.233 --> 33:25.613
developed by that brilliant
neurophysiologist, Robert Henderson.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.617
Presently known to his friends
as Henry Roberts.

33:32.202 --> 33:33.329
Who are you?

33:33.412 --> 33:37.166
Lloyd Moreaux, patron of the arts,
and soon to be much more.

33:37.666 --> 33:39.752
Yeah, look, my father's a senator.

33:39.835 --> 33:42.004
Yes, I've met him. Fine fellow.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.131
Well, I've got other connections, too.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.467
You mess with me,
you mess with the IADC.

33:46.550 --> 33:49.136
That is precisely what I was counting on.

33:49.470 --> 33:53.557
Diana Prince has even bigger connections.
When she figures out what you-

33:56.226 --> 33:59.396
Never you mind, Mr. Farnum.

33:59.980 --> 34:03.108
That's just what I was hoping to hear.
Henry?

34:11.742 --> 34:16.705
Let's make sure that Ms. Prince
does indeed figure it out, shall we?

34:17.331 --> 34:21.460
- I trust you know how to get to the IADC?
- Yes, sir.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.424
Put him away.

35:07.380 --> 35:10.967
"Your time runs out at midnight
I'm surprised at you, Ms. Prince

35:11.050 --> 35:15.930
"If you don't break the cycle soon
You'll never have the chance"

35:26.024 --> 35:29.652
The total value of the stolen artworks
is more than $2 million.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.697
If Wonder Woman
hadn't recovered that medallion...

35:32.780 --> 35:35.366
our thief would be on his way
to making it $3 million.

35:35.450 --> 35:38.786
Whoever he is,
he's sure eager we don't forget it.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.788
Both of his riddles indicate...

35:40.872 --> 35:44.292
that he's stealing these artworks
in some kind of a pattern.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.086
Whatever the pattern is, it's about to end.

35:47.170 --> 35:49.505
That's about all
we've been able to figure out.

35:49.589 --> 35:53.551
Which is why I have no choice
but to consult Mr. Personality in here.

35:53.634 --> 35:55.386
- Care to join me?
- No, thanks.

35:55.469 --> 35:58.180
I have no desire
to make a bad day even worse.

36:00.266 --> 36:01.392
Coward.

36:10.609 --> 36:13.779
Circuits C5 through D7 are overheating.

36:14.363 --> 36:17.366
Come on, Ira.
We've not been at it that long.

36:17.825 --> 36:21.537
We have been at it for two hours,
Diana Prince.

36:21.871 --> 36:23.789
I need a lube job.

36:23.873 --> 36:27.835
Okay, we'll go onto something else.
What about the second riddle?

36:30.171 --> 36:33.507
Why would the thief
want to emphasize the word "midnight"?

36:33.591 --> 36:37.094
Perhaps he was referring to 12:00.

36:37.177 --> 36:38.345
Twelve.

36:40.556 --> 36:42.516
He's stolen 11 objects...

36:42.600 --> 36:45.185
I bet he means the pattern
ends with the twelfth.

36:45.269 --> 36:47.438
A logical conclusion.

36:47.521 --> 36:52.067
So, what pattern is composed
of 12 elements?

36:52.568 --> 36:55.237
The word "chance " could be significant.

36:55.863 --> 36:57.114
Chance.

36:59.908 --> 37:01.493
Let's see.

37:02.870 --> 37:06.081
He's stolen a still life of scales,
a jade scorpion...

37:06.165 --> 37:08.292
a mosaic entitled Centaur...

37:08.876 --> 37:12.087
Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius. That's it.

37:12.170 --> 37:15.173
All are symbols of the Zodiac.

37:15.257 --> 37:18.969
That's right. And if the last thing he stole
was a bull...

37:19.052 --> 37:23.432
Next in sequence would be twins,
the symbol for Gemini.

37:23.515 --> 37:24.683
Twins.

37:28.812 --> 37:30.313
Romulus and Remus.

37:30.397 --> 37:34.151
Those Henry Roberts statues that were
supposed to be sent to Rome next month.

37:34.234 --> 37:37.904
10-to-1 they are to be
the thief's grand finale.

37:37.988 --> 37:42.159
Thank you, Ira. I am off to catch a thief.

37:43.243 --> 37:45.745
A word of caution, Diana Prince.

37:45.829 --> 37:49.749
The thief obviously wanted the IADC
to reach this conclusion.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.420
His or her reasons are still unknown.

37:53.503 --> 37:56.881
I'm aware of that, Ira.
That's why I intend to go as...

37:59.217 --> 38:01.761
And be very careful. Bye.

38:08.101 --> 38:12.063
Even Wonder Woman
cannot be too careful, Diana Prince.

40:03.924 --> 40:07.094
Okay. What is this all about?

40:07.177 --> 40:09.680
It is about your demise, Wonder Woman.

40:09.763 --> 40:12.933
Your carefully planned,
eagerly anticipated demise.

40:22.567 --> 40:24.403
Welcome to my museum.

40:25.320 --> 40:27.698
So, you lured me here purposely?

40:27.864 --> 40:30.325
It was all a plan.
The art thefts, the poems.

40:30.409 --> 40:32.953
All were part of an intricate choreography.

40:33.036 --> 40:37.332
We knew that if we involved the IADC,
you would ultimately be involved.

40:37.416 --> 40:41.420
Diana Prince warned me that there was
more to all this than met the eye.

40:41.503 --> 40:44.005
Which is why, upon solving my riddle...

40:44.089 --> 40:47.592
she sent you here rather than coming
herself with the police.

40:47.676 --> 40:49.594
How boringly predictable of her.

40:49.678 --> 40:53.014
Speaking ofboring, why am I here?

40:53.515 --> 40:56.851
You are about to become
my latest work of art.

40:56.935 --> 40:59.312
Several people know
that my mentor here...

40:59.396 --> 41:03.316
plans to open his Putney exhibit
by unveiling a statue of Wonder Woman.

41:03.400 --> 41:07.195
I shall be there for the unveiling,
as will you, Wonder Woman.

41:07.737 --> 41:10.865
This will produce an electrical signal...

41:11.533 --> 41:15.120
which will place you
in a state of suspended animation.

41:16.162 --> 41:17.497
Forever.

41:18.373 --> 41:21.918
No, thank you. I have two of my own,
just like it.

42:00.331 --> 42:02.583
After I destroy this...

42:02.667 --> 42:05.878
you're going to tell me
who you are, and where you are.

42:05.962 --> 42:07.922
Wait, Wonder Woman.

42:10.758 --> 42:13.678
- Harold?
- Mr. Farnum is unable to answer.

42:13.761 --> 42:17.473
In fact, right now, Mr. Farnum is unable
to do much of anything.

42:18.474 --> 42:19.684
Let him go.

42:19.767 --> 42:22.728
After the N.I.M. unit
is placed on your wrist.

42:25.439 --> 42:26.649
Right now.

42:26.732 --> 42:30.820
Right now, I can put an end
to all of Mr. Farnum's vital functions.

42:31.112 --> 42:33.489
Would you like that, Wonder Woman?

42:50.673 --> 42:53.968
- You win.
- I won the day I planned this.

42:54.802 --> 42:57.429
The rest was simply a matter of time.

43:03.394 --> 43:07.064
Now, let's see. Hands on your hips, I think.

43:08.524 --> 43:11.652
Yes, that's it. And now, smile.

43:12.820 --> 43:16.240
Smile the smile you would like to wear
through eternity.

43:16.782 --> 43:19.576
Because wear it through eternity
you shall.

43:24.081 --> 43:27.209
Henry, say goodbye to
the one person in the world...

43:27.292 --> 43:31.505
who could have stood between us and
everything in the world worth stealing.

43:40.806 --> 43:44.101
They do take rather a long time.
I think it's worth it, don't you?

43:44.184 --> 43:45.977
Would you excuse me?

43:52.818 --> 43:54.861
Ladies and gentlemen.

43:54.945 --> 43:57.697
I want to say that I am deeply honored...

43:57.781 --> 44:02.035
that so many of you have chosen to attend
this formal opening of my new show.

44:02.118 --> 44:05.455
And so, to honor you, my latest...

44:05.538 --> 44:09.042
and hopefully my best creation.
If you please.

44:25.308 --> 44:28.812
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
May I have your attention?

44:30.855 --> 44:34.776
As you know, I've supported Henry's work
for three years now...

44:35.610 --> 44:37.820
helped him monetarily and spiritually...

44:37.904 --> 44:40.657
as he struggled to perfect his technique.

44:41.950 --> 44:44.911
But whatever debt he may have incurred
is now forgotten.

44:44.994 --> 44:48.331
For I, through him,
have created a masterpiece.

44:51.417 --> 44:55.671
His statue captures the very heart
and soul of the great lady it depicts...

44:55.755 --> 44:58.758
as Wonder Woman herself
would have to admit.

45:12.688 --> 45:14.106
Reel him in.

45:21.489 --> 45:24.450
What a familiar voice you have,
Mr. Moreaux.

45:24.533 --> 45:28.454
- You tricked me.
- I had to find out who you were, somehow.

45:28.996 --> 45:32.333
But I was sure the modulator would work,
even on you.

45:32.583 --> 45:34.502
It may very well have worked...

45:34.585 --> 45:37.963
if I hadn't switched it
for one of my own bracelets.

45:38.714 --> 45:41.217
That wasn't part of the choreography.

45:41.300 --> 45:45.346
Neither was your returning Harold Farnum
and those other statues to normal.

45:45.429 --> 45:48.349
But that's precisely
what you're about to do.

45:48.891 --> 45:50.142
Shall we?

45:55.064 --> 45:58.817
So Moreaux figured out how to combine
Roberts' knowledge of electronics...

45:58.901 --> 46:02.196
with his own knowledge of art
so they could make a killing.

46:02.279 --> 46:04.114
Bad choice of words.

46:04.198 --> 46:07.993
Unfortunately, you stumbled onto
their plan to remove Wonder Woman.

46:09.161 --> 46:12.247
One good thing about what
those guys did to me is...

46:12.331 --> 46:15.084
it gave me a lot of time to think.
Which I did.

46:15.542 --> 46:17.252
Mostly about us.

46:17.920 --> 46:18.962
Us?

46:19.922 --> 46:22.799
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- As in night?

46:22.883 --> 46:26.845
There's a party at the fraternity I'm going
to pledge. The college...

46:29.348 --> 46:32.684
- What?
- My term paper!

46:33.018 --> 46:36.438
I don't have a topic anymore
and it's due in three days.

46:37.272 --> 46:40.400
Diana, I'm gonna have to work
on that paper tomorrow night.

46:40.484 --> 46:42.277
Listen, I understand.

46:42.361 --> 46:44.613
But I'll make it up to you,
I will. I promise.

46:44.696 --> 46:46.114
No hurry, Harold.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.493
No hurry.

47:26.988 --> 47:28.031
