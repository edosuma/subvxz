Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:49.835 --> 02:51.437
<i>Seas the day.</i>

03:39.183 --> 03:41.084
You promised you'd come down.

03:45.356 --> 03:47.126
Yeah, two minutes.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.180
So, yourself and Hazel

04:44.182 --> 04:46.118
will be moving back then?

04:47.218 --> 04:49.286
- What?
- To the States.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.954
Heard you're goin' home.

04:51.956 --> 04:53.957
This is home.

05:24.255 --> 05:25.788
I hear you're movin'.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.026
<i>Ah, you're not
staying here, surely.</i>

05:30.028 --> 05:32.298
<i>Not after what happened
in this house.</i>

05:33.632 --> 05:35.735
Why don't you
give the hotel a shot..

05:37.403 --> 05:39.502
...outside Dublin?

05:39.504 --> 05:41.637
Could be a fresh start
for the pair of you.

05:41.639 --> 05:44.074
<i>And you'll be helping me out.</i>

05:44.076 --> 05:45.308
<i>I'll talk to Hazel.</i>

05:45.310 --> 05:46.909
<i>She might listen
to her favorite uncle.</i>

05:48.747 --> 05:50.647
<i>Here he is, our Prince.</i>

05:50.649 --> 05:53.183
How's the boy?
There's a good dog.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.452
There's a good dog.

06:01.793 --> 06:04.560
<i>Expect delays coming out
of Dublin and for those of you</i>

06:04.562 --> 06:07.764
<i>heading west towards Galway,
traffic is flowing nicely.</i>

06:07.766 --> 06:10.666
<i>Some delays can be expected,
however, as scattered showers</i>

06:10.668 --> 06:12.002
<i>roll in from the Atlantic</i>

06:12.004 --> 06:14.271
<i>and travelers
have been asked to slow down.</i>

06:14.273 --> 06:17.574
<i>Especially on the N6
where roadworks are in place.</i>

06:17.576 --> 06:20.043
<i>Later we can look forward
to more sunshine</i>

06:20.045 --> 06:22.211
<i>there's no showers on the way..</i>

06:53.879 --> 06:55.878
Here we are.

07:10.528 --> 07:11.531
Come on.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.865
In you go.

07:17.536 --> 07:18.504
<i>Hey.</i>

07:39.591 --> 07:41.091
There's a lot of words
in that box.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.192
Yeah.

07:42.194 --> 07:44.694
My husband's a writer.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.566
<i>Oh, no, not there,
go downstairs.</i>

07:55.439 --> 07:59.242
You're a writer?
Have I heard of you?

07:59.244 --> 08:01.777
Ben Slater? Nope.

08:01.779 --> 08:04.382
Yeah,
that's why I'm teaching now.

08:10.055 --> 08:12.057
Beautiful part of the world.

08:13.158 --> 08:14.759
<i>Yeah, sure is.</i>

08:16.127 --> 08:18.127
Morning racers.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.365
Dangerous assholes.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.471
One of them nearly
ran me over last summer.

08:26.437 --> 08:28.373
If I wasn't such a good..

09:02.341 --> 09:03.308
Hey.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.075
Where'd you find that?

09:06.077 --> 09:07.576
Amongst my dad's old things.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.514
I thought I'd lost it.

09:10.282 --> 09:11.551
Look at this.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.186
My nan.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.855
My dad's sisters,
Kate and Rita.

09:19.857 --> 09:22.294
They wanted me to marry
a nice local guy.

09:23.128 --> 09:24.294
Oh, there's Dave Pearce.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.566
Oh, I was nuts about him.

09:27.298 --> 09:28.765
Young love.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.700
Kinda wish we could go back
to that, that feeling.

09:31.702 --> 09:33.603
Like to Daisy Vaugh?

09:33.605 --> 09:36.205
Ooh, you never told me
about her.

09:36.207 --> 09:38.675
My first real kiss,
seventh grade

09:38.677 --> 09:40.944
behind the music hall.

09:40.946 --> 09:44.216
I wish we got second lives
like we got second teeth.

09:49.553 --> 09:51.156
Remember that day?

09:51.789 --> 09:52.757
Yeah.

09:54.025 --> 09:57.227
We built that sandcastle
on the beach.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.665
We were also fighting
like crazy.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.536
You know we got through it.

10:16.881 --> 10:18.083
Come on.

10:28.326 --> 10:31.931
Serena. I haven't heard
from her since the funeral.

10:35.533 --> 10:36.802
Let's eat.

10:59.490 --> 11:00.759
Prince!

13:17.028 --> 13:19.228
- <i>Come on, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Yeah, come on, Daddy.</i>

13:19.230 --> 13:21.296
Don't just lie there
like a big lump.

13:21.298 --> 13:23.233
Help Mommy build..
What's it called again?

13:23.235 --> 13:25.300
- A moat.
- A moat.

13:25.302 --> 13:27.837
- A boat?
- <i>A moat, dipstick.</i>

13:27.839 --> 13:29.238
- Ah!
- He's a dipstick..

13:29.240 --> 13:33.910
Oh, is that so? Well, you
just watch this dipstick dig.

13:33.912 --> 13:36.945
Molly, get the bucket,
go get some water.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.281
"Molly get the bucket,
Molly get the water."

13:39.283 --> 13:40.782
What would you do
if I wasn't here?

13:40.784 --> 13:43.721
Ahh, run. Run, run, run.

13:47.491 --> 13:49.993
- I'm sorry, did we wake you?
- What?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.996
Cut the tortured writer crap.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.934
You're complex, I get it.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.432
Jesus.

13:57.434 --> 13:59.370
- Flags, Mommy.
- Oh!

14:35.307 --> 14:36.575
What the fuck?

14:53.658 --> 14:56.224
<i>The minister's now facing
a motion of no confidence</i>

14:56.226 --> 14:58.227
<i>after the opposition claimed..</i>

15:17.481 --> 15:18.750
"Seas the day."

15:33.697 --> 15:37.135
This opens the library, the
drama room, my computer space.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.306
Can I buy gas with it?

15:41.905 --> 15:44.272
You'll enjoy Sacred Heart.

15:44.274 --> 15:48.243
We're all very excited to have
a real author in our midst.

15:48.245 --> 15:49.247
Thank you.

15:51.249 --> 15:52.518
Pick it up.

15:58.056 --> 16:00.857
We're here today
to ask God's blessing

16:00.859 --> 16:03.158
as we begin
a new school year.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.296
So, if you would bow your heads.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.864
<i>The Lord is not slow
to fulfill</i>

16:08.866 --> 16:12.901
<i>His promise
as some understand slowness..</i>

16:12.903 --> 16:15.637
<i>...but is patient with you.</i>

16:15.639 --> 16:18.174
<i>Not wanting anyone to perish.</i>

16:18.176 --> 16:20.778
- You wanna go to hell?
- <i>But everyone to come to repentance.</i>

16:22.279 --> 16:25.882
<i>And so to bring His plan
to fruition</i>

16:25.884 --> 16:29.321
He uses sinful men
for His purposes.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.122
Give of yourself

16:33.124 --> 16:36.758
<i>and heaven and earth will move
to accommodate your wishes.</i>

16:36.760 --> 16:39.395
<i>Ask and you shall receive.</i>

16:39.397 --> 16:40.829
<i>Can I have a new car?</i>

16:43.835 --> 16:46.368
It's got multiple murders, sex

16:46.370 --> 16:49.071
ghosts, dirty jokes, the lot.

16:49.073 --> 16:51.306
The Elizabethans love
their dirty jokes.

16:51.308 --> 16:53.542
I've got a dirty joke.

16:53.544 --> 16:55.480
I've got detention slips.

16:56.914 --> 16:58.314
Are you supposed to be famous?

16:58.316 --> 17:01.754
Google me,
if you haven't already.

17:03.455 --> 17:07.390
But google "Macbeth" as well,
guys, we begin act one tomorrow.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.967
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow

17:17.969 --> 17:20.635
"creeps in
this petty past from day to day

17:20.637 --> 17:23.005
"to the last syllable
of recorded time

17:23.007 --> 17:26.409
"and all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

17:26.411 --> 17:28.243
the way to dusty death."

17:28.246 --> 17:31.780
That was,
that was "Brief Candle."

17:31.782 --> 17:34.749
Very good, father, there's
an actor beneath that collar.

17:34.751 --> 17:36.986
Ah, no chance of that now.

17:36.988 --> 17:39.188
- Sean Brady.
- Ben Slater.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.789
Nice to meet you, Ben.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.525
Drama appreciation.

17:42.527 --> 17:45.026
Now, who's the genius
that came up with that one, huh?

17:45.028 --> 17:47.497
Who curses you I need the gig?

17:47.499 --> 17:49.398
Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,
Ben Slater.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.967
Do you know what, welcome
to Ireland for God's sake.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.434
I've actually been
living here for...

17:52.436 --> 17:55.505
You know, this school has its
fair share of the living dead

17:55.507 --> 17:57.340
but the majority of them
still have a pulse.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.874
And tonight is the quiz night.

17:58.876 --> 18:00.343
You have to come.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.844
Hughes Pub, most of the staff
will be there.

18:02.846 --> 18:05.081
- Oh, you married?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:05.083 --> 18:08.187
Bring the wife. That way we'll
all get a good look at her.

18:27.471 --> 18:29.407
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- Hey.

18:35.445 --> 18:37.345
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, babe.

18:37.347 --> 18:40.583
- How was school?
- School was cool.

18:40.585 --> 18:43.318
- I went to the mass.
- Huh, you?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.790
Uh, no, not just me,
the whole school.

18:47.791 --> 18:51.861
Jesus. I met a priest.
He's a bit of a character.

18:51.863 --> 18:54.396
He invited us to a quiz night.

18:54.398 --> 18:57.600
The whole staff's gonna be
there, it's tonight.

18:57.602 --> 19:00.236
What? We're opening a hotel
in less than three weeks, Ben.

19:00.238 --> 19:03.139
- I have so much I need to do.
- Well, Ha..

19:04.576 --> 19:07.179
Hazel, I didn't come here
to hide, we're going.

19:10.615 --> 19:13.548
So, the final question
for ten pints.

19:14.751 --> 19:19.555
"What children's
character said

19:19.557 --> 19:22.190
<i>"You can have anything
in life if you will sacrifice</i>

19:22.192 --> 19:24.727
<i>everything else for it?"</i>

19:24.729 --> 19:27.462
Who said that? I haven't a clue.

19:27.464 --> 19:30.932
- Come on, think, Donald Trump.
- Trump, my ass.

19:30.934 --> 19:34.202
- I know, he's a fool.
- Well, that's what Ivana says.

19:34.204 --> 19:38.143
"And dreams do come true,
if only we wish hard enough."

19:39.042 --> 19:40.742
Peter Pan.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.679
Write it down.

19:43.681 --> 19:46.082
<i>Hey, we might win
this thing yet, huh?</i>

19:46.084 --> 19:50.686
Hazel... uh, I'm not sure
if you remember, but, um..

19:50.688 --> 19:52.958
- Dave.
- Yeah.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.891
How are you?

19:55.893 --> 19:59.461
Wow, uh,
t... this is my husband, Ben.

19:59.463 --> 20:01.463
- Oh, right. Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

20:01.465 --> 20:02.898
<i>I heard you moved town,
you're, um</i>

20:02.900 --> 20:04.169
<i>opening the hotel again,
aren't you?</i>

20:05.737 --> 20:07.469
God, it's been years.

20:07.471 --> 20:09.537
A long time. Are you still..

20:09.539 --> 20:11.873
- Single. Yeah.
- No, I'm..

20:11.875 --> 20:14.943
No, I-I mean,
are you still living..

20:14.945 --> 20:17.979
Still living here, yeah.
I am, for my sins.

20:17.981 --> 20:19.715
That's good.

20:19.717 --> 20:21.653
Anyway, I should, um..

20:23.153 --> 20:25.423
Right, well, anyway,
it was good seeing you.

20:27.924 --> 20:32.295
And the winner is,
by one pint, the Furious Five.

20:34.298 --> 20:36.364
Donald Trump!

20:36.366 --> 20:38.566
Speaking of which,
tell us what brought

20:38.568 --> 20:40.469
you two
into the hotel business?

20:40.471 --> 20:41.871
The glamor.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.105
In this place? I doubt it.

20:44.107 --> 20:45.607
You're not from around here.

20:45.609 --> 20:48.576
My parents were Irish,
actually, and, uh..

20:48.578 --> 20:50.446
...I went to university
in Dublin.

20:50.448 --> 20:53.915
Spent every summer here, since
my father had the romantic idea

20:53.917 --> 20:55.651
to buy a small hotel
on the west coast

20:55.653 --> 20:58.921
which my uncle now owns.

20:58.923 --> 21:01.222
Which would have been sold
if we hadn't stepped in.

21:01.224 --> 21:02.526
<i>So, here we are.</i>

21:03.795 --> 21:05.861
Any experience
in the hospitality business?

21:05.863 --> 21:09.632
Pfft, not really, my experience
is in advertising. It was.

21:09.634 --> 21:12.403
That's how we met,
I used to write copy for her.

21:13.403 --> 21:16.372
- Man of many talents.
- And master of none.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.910
So, how does advertising
compare to the classroom?

21:20.912 --> 21:23.211
More children in advertising.

21:23.213 --> 21:24.979
- So you quit?
- <i>Yep.</i>

21:24.981 --> 21:28.784
We, uh, we sold everything
and bought a house in Dublin.

21:28.786 --> 21:31.620
<i>And we traveled
around the world.</i>

21:31.622 --> 21:33.892
I suppose you can do that
when you don't have children.

21:35.359 --> 21:37.295
What makes you think
we don't have children?

21:38.762 --> 21:40.398
Oh, no, I just thought.

21:41.065 --> 21:42.898

23:18.930 --> 23:21.197
It's what you wanted.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.932
And you'll never let me
forget it.

23:23.934 --> 23:26.235
I never said a word.

23:26.237 --> 23:29.471
You know, some of my best
memories are on this beach.

23:29.473 --> 23:31.873
You, me and Molly.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.145
There's a magic here,
don't you feel it?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.816
I can hear it.

23:39.817 --> 23:41.650
Make a wish.

23:41.652 --> 23:43.552
- What?
- Go on, close your eyes.

23:43.554 --> 23:44.823
Make a wish.

24:01.005 --> 24:04.443
Wow, what did you wish for?

24:05.675 --> 24:07.611
You know the rules.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.219
Mm.

24:15.819 --> 24:18.988
You're gonna write about this,
aren't you?

24:18.990 --> 24:22.658
- Midnight dance.
- Twisting on the beach.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.492
- Galway Beach.
- Galway.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.194
That's important.

24:26.196 --> 24:27.164
Hm.

24:47.351 --> 24:49.884
Don't look at me like
I'm made of glass.

24:49.886 --> 24:51.155
Fuck me.

25:33.998 --> 25:35.663
What is it, buddy?

25:38.234 --> 25:39.203
Hm?

26:21.278 --> 26:22.480
Hey.

26:24.815 --> 26:26.418
Serena?

26:37.862 --> 26:40.161
She's drunk.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.462
Should we call a doctor?

26:41.464 --> 26:43.400
Let her sleep it off.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.273
You know what she's like, she
always has to make an entrance.

27:25.308 --> 27:28.443
"Which keeps me pale,
light thickens

27:28.445 --> 27:31.747
"and the crow, and the crow

27:31.749 --> 27:34.352
makes wing to the rocky wood."

27:44.795 --> 27:48.730
The crow,
what does it symbolize?

27:48.732 --> 27:50.034
Death.

27:51.035 --> 27:52.971
Is he still alive?

27:57.007 --> 28:00.942
Cut it out, guys.
I said cut it out!

28:09.452 --> 28:12.956
Excuse me, sir,
will you, um, sign this?

28:13.958 --> 28:15.694
Oh, did it speak to you?

28:17.127 --> 28:18.696
- Jenny, right?
- Mm-hm.

28:20.029 --> 28:21.098
<i>Jenny.</i>

28:22.333 --> 28:23.398
<i>Oh, look.</i>

28:30.039 --> 28:31.606
Thank you.

28:43.186 --> 28:46.321
You're growing
your fan base, I see.

28:46.323 --> 28:49.458
My followers
are out of control.

28:50.928 --> 28:53.161
Listen, I'm organizing
a little poker game

28:53.163 --> 28:54.563
in the staff room
at lunchtime

28:54.565 --> 28:56.398
it'd be great
if you could join us.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.499
- Do you play?
- Only in Vegas.

28:58.501 --> 29:00.401
Fair enough.

29:00.403 --> 29:01.870
Strip poker then?

29:01.872 --> 29:03.872
Some of the women are in there
divesting themselves

29:03.874 --> 29:05.740
of their underwear
even as we speak.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.076
How the hell
did you become a priest?

29:09.078 --> 29:10.478
How?

29:10.480 --> 29:13.114
Because I believe
in Christ the Redeemer

29:13.116 --> 29:16.184
and I thought
the church did, too.

29:16.186 --> 29:18.452
So, sue me.

29:18.454 --> 29:19.955
One of the good ones, huh?

29:19.957 --> 29:22.824
I'm a contrary bollocks.

29:22.826 --> 29:25.026
Mind you, so is He.

29:25.028 --> 29:27.161
That's why they put Him
on a cross.

29:27.163 --> 29:30.265
But I am a priest and I know
that I have a mouth

29:30.267 --> 29:33.768
as big as the Gap of Dunloe,
but I am a good listener.

29:33.770 --> 29:35.706
You know,
whenever you needed to..

29:37.307 --> 29:40.976
Yeah, I don't wanna be
rude but I just

29:40.978 --> 29:42.510
I've got a class coming up.

29:42.512 --> 29:44.782
I hear you, I hear you.

30:22.752 --> 30:26.023
Serena, you gave us
a scare last night.

30:39.036 --> 30:40.971
<i>Should she be drinking?</i>

30:43.073 --> 30:45.940
Drinking's the least
of her problems.

30:45.942 --> 30:47.910
Did you see her eyes?

30:47.912 --> 30:51.682
She was a mess last night,
she was going on and on.

30:53.217 --> 30:55.116
What was she saying?

30:55.118 --> 30:57.184
How did she
even find this place?

30:57.186 --> 30:59.020
I don't know.

30:59.022 --> 31:00.288
I mean, she took the train

31:00.290 --> 31:03.392
and then some guy in the pub
told her where we lived

31:03.394 --> 31:05.997
and so she walked,
in the rain.

31:10.567 --> 31:12.334
Okay,
as long as we don't leave

31:12.336 --> 31:14.838
any sharp objects lying around.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.384
So, you've given up
writing then?

31:28.251 --> 31:29.851
No.

31:29.853 --> 31:32.153
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

31:32.155 --> 31:34.759
It's just they say
we all have one book in us.

31:36.993 --> 31:38.794
I don't.

31:38.796 --> 31:40.629
<i>No, you do.</i>

31:40.631 --> 31:42.264
- We all do, everyone does.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

31:42.266 --> 31:44.201
We all have
at least one book in us.

31:46.403 --> 31:48.202
I'm missing your point, Serena.

31:48.204 --> 31:51.141
Mm. Maybe you've written yours.

31:52.542 --> 31:53.510
Ah.

31:54.444 --> 31:57.379
Serena,
I read a glowing review

31:57.381 --> 31:59.280
<i>of your jewelry online.</i>

31:59.282 --> 32:03.051
Either I wrote that
or I fucked the person who did.

32:03.053 --> 32:05.253
<i>Oh, I think you're being
too hard on yourself.</i>

32:05.255 --> 32:07.221
I think
you're an amazing designer.

32:07.223 --> 32:10.160
Thank you. And I think you're
gonna have an amazing hotel.

32:11.528 --> 32:12.797
I do, too.

32:49.665 --> 32:51.499
Oh.

32:51.501 --> 32:53.701
What are you even doing here?

32:53.703 --> 32:56.371
Hazel's doing fine,
she doesn't need this.

32:56.373 --> 32:57.572
What about me?

32:57.574 --> 32:59.040
Maybe I need this.

32:59.042 --> 33:00.441
Shall I tell you
where the last six...

33:00.443 --> 33:01.709
- Don't you...
- Shall I tell her?

33:01.711 --> 33:03.545
Don't you dare
say a word to her.

33:03.547 --> 33:04.912
Or what?

33:04.914 --> 33:06.480
You'll what?

33:06.482 --> 33:08.449
Keep your voice down, okay?

33:08.451 --> 33:09.817
What is it you want?

33:09.819 --> 33:11.686
- Do you want money?
- I don't need your money.

33:11.688 --> 33:14.488
- I can look after myself.
- Can you?

33:14.490 --> 33:15.759
<i>Can you, hm?</i>

33:18.595 --> 33:21.162
It happened,
but now it's time to...

33:21.164 --> 33:22.432
Move on?

33:24.634 --> 33:26.738
Is that what you hate me for?

33:28.038 --> 33:30.505
You think I don't spend
every waking moment

33:30.507 --> 33:32.908
thinking about that day?

33:32.910 --> 33:35.309
You think I don't feel it
the way you do?

33:35.311 --> 33:37.912
You really think
I don't feel it?

33:37.914 --> 33:39.182
Feel what?

33:40.584 --> 33:43.250
What don't you feel?

33:43.252 --> 33:45.856
Serena thinks
I don't emote enough.

33:52.563 --> 33:54.028
I'm gonna have a glass of wine.

34:18.054 --> 34:20.054
"Seas the day."

34:20.056 --> 34:21.922
- What'd you say?
- That couldn't be right.

34:21.925 --> 34:23.257
<i>"S-E-A-S."</i>

34:23.260 --> 34:26.197
<i>Shouldn't that be spelled
S-E-I-Z-E?</i>

34:27.530 --> 34:29.764
I'm good, thanks.

34:29.766 --> 34:30.898
<i>Well, excuse me.</i>

34:30.900 --> 34:32.166
You drop that,
you're paying for it.

34:40.476 --> 34:41.445
Hey.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.679
Don't I know you?

34:45.681 --> 34:47.617
I don't think so.

34:49.152 --> 34:51.820
Maybe. I... I did have a book.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.760
Pretty sure
we don't know each other.

34:57.793 --> 34:59.126
Enjoy your coffee.

35:16.813 --> 35:18.749
<i>Sorry, sir. He pushed me.</i>

35:22.686 --> 35:24.288
Alright, let's go.

35:30.860 --> 35:32.927
You could be expelled
for that.

35:39.735 --> 35:41.672
Get out of here.

35:48.644 --> 35:51.845
Lady Macbeth,
what do we know about her?

35:51.847 --> 35:53.347
What's she like?

35:53.349 --> 35:55.217
<i>She's a tough bitch.</i>

35:55.219 --> 35:58.519
She is a tough bitch.
But listen to this.

35:58.521 --> 36:02.523
"Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall."

36:02.525 --> 36:04.059
Woman's breasts. Ha-ha-ha.

36:04.061 --> 36:06.260
Gall, what is it?

36:06.262 --> 36:08.729
They made Christ drink it
on the cross.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.465
- Vinegar.
- Right.

36:11.467 --> 36:14.034
So, she wants the milk in her
breasts to turn to vinegar

36:14.036 --> 36:17.104
which raises the question,
why is she lactating?

36:18.608 --> 36:19.974
Producing milk, dickheads.

36:19.976 --> 36:22.110
And? Tell 'em why.

36:22.112 --> 36:23.711
She's pregnant.

36:23.713 --> 36:26.380
"I have given suck
and know how tender

36:26.382 --> 36:29.650
'tis to love the babe
that milks me."

36:29.652 --> 36:32.153
But there's no baby Macbeth
in this play.

36:32.155 --> 36:34.488
- So?
- It died.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.657
And since she's still lactating?

36:36.659 --> 36:38.492
Just died.

36:38.494 --> 36:43.398
A tough bitch,
a woman's baby has just died.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.670
Enough to drive her crazy
with grief.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.970
And Macbeth..

36:48.972 --> 36:50.304
...we were told
in the very beginning

36:50.306 --> 36:52.307
that he was fearless in battle

36:52.309 --> 36:54.541
that he would just throw himself
at the enemy.

36:54.543 --> 36:56.646
<i>Didn't care whether he lived
or died.</i>

36:58.347 --> 37:00.282
He was heartbroken.

37:00.284 --> 37:03.418
And he'll move heaven and earth
to make it right again.

38:13.623 --> 38:15.289
- <i>Daddy.</i>
- <i>Come on, Daddy.</i>

38:15.291 --> 38:17.025
Don't just lie there
like a big lump.

38:17.027 --> 38:19.293
Help Mommy build..
What's it called again?

38:19.295 --> 38:21.195
- A moat.
- A moat.

38:21.197 --> 38:23.865
- A boat?
- <i>A moat, dipstick.</i>

38:23.867 --> 38:25.333
- Ah!
- Daddy's a dipstick.

38:25.335 --> 38:29.106
Oh, is that so? Well, you just
watch this dipstick dig.

38:30.773 --> 38:34.045
Molly, you get the bucket
and go get some water, honey.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.845
I'm sorry, did we wake you?

38:37.847 --> 38:38.815
What?

38:44.855 --> 38:47.255
- Flags, Mommy.
- <i>Oh.</i>

39:49.952 --> 39:51.920
The sandcastle.

39:51.922 --> 39:54.021
You remember the day
we built a big sandcastle?

39:54.023 --> 39:55.824
- <i>You, me and Molly?</i>
- What?

39:55.826 --> 39:57.758
What time is it?

39:57.760 --> 39:59.293
Ugh! Where were you?

39:59.295 --> 40:01.095
- I tried calling you.
- The sandcastle.

40:01.097 --> 40:03.298
The one, the big one
with the moat, right?

40:03.300 --> 40:04.766
And we had the little red flags?

40:04.768 --> 40:05.900
What are you talking about?

40:05.902 --> 40:07.001
Tell me you remember.

40:07.003 --> 40:09.940
Yeah, the red flags, I remember.

40:15.778 --> 40:17.244
You wanna build a sandcastle?

40:17.246 --> 40:19.546
"Seas the day."

40:19.548 --> 40:20.648
I've been seeing it everywhere.

40:20.650 --> 40:21.916
It was written in the sand.

40:21.918 --> 40:24.686
- On my computer.
- What are you talking about?

40:24.688 --> 40:25.787
Oh, fuck, you're drunk.

40:25.789 --> 40:28.025
Maybe, but it doesn't matter..

40:29.492 --> 40:31.429
...'cause I think
I figured it out.

40:32.728 --> 40:35.597
I have had the exact same dream
now, twice

40:35.599 --> 40:38.266
about the day
we built the sandcastle..

40:38.268 --> 40:40.534
...except I don't think
it's a dream.

40:40.536 --> 40:42.836
It's like it's a, a message

40:42.838 --> 40:46.039
a message from someone
or something.

40:46.041 --> 40:48.709
- You're scaring me.
- Just listen to me, please.

40:48.711 --> 40:50.278
Okay?

40:50.280 --> 40:52.246
When I first woke up,
"Seas the day"

40:52.248 --> 40:54.481
was written in the sand.

40:54.483 --> 40:57.284
Tonight you handed me the flag

40:57.286 --> 40:58.720
to stick into the sandcastle

40:58.722 --> 41:01.158
only the dream ended
before I could do it.

41:02.492 --> 41:04.428
When I woke up..

41:05.295 --> 41:07.595
...I still had the flag.

41:07.597 --> 41:09.533
It was in my hand, Hazel.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.766
I don't understand.

41:12.768 --> 41:14.269
"Seas the day."

41:14.271 --> 41:15.873
It's a..

41:16.907 --> 41:19.173
It's like
a childish misspelling.

41:19.175 --> 41:22.409
It's supposed
to be like S-E-I-Z-E.

41:22.411 --> 41:25.146
It means seize <i>that</i> day.

41:25.148 --> 41:28.081
What if it means seize <i>her?</i>

41:28.083 --> 41:30.517
- Who?
- Molly.

41:30.519 --> 41:32.452
And instead of holding
the red flag

41:32.454 --> 41:34.222
when the dream ended

41:34.224 --> 41:36.423
what I if I was holding
onto her hand?

41:36.425 --> 41:37.825
What if I could pull her
out of that dream?

41:37.827 --> 41:39.927
- Ben...
- You know, pull her out of that day.

41:39.929 --> 41:41.496
- Don't you hear yourself?
- No, because we could change it.

41:41.498 --> 41:44.434
- We could change the past.
- Don't you hear yourself?

41:46.769 --> 41:48.706
I know what I saw.

41:53.242 --> 41:54.844
<i>Ben, please.</i>

42:02.418 --> 42:04.687
I've thought a lot
about that day, too.

42:06.523 --> 42:08.856
That was the day
the boat came round the point

42:08.858 --> 42:10.794
and you were out swimming.

42:13.429 --> 42:14.795
I've often wondered
what would have...

42:14.797 --> 42:15.765
What?

42:19.802 --> 42:21.536
If it had hit me?

42:21.538 --> 42:24.307
Maybe Molly wouldn't have
fallen down the stairs?

42:25.775 --> 42:28.711
You were supposed
to be looking after her.

42:30.981 --> 42:34.084
You were
supposed to be minding her.

42:59.509 --> 43:02.809
<i>Lack of sleep is usually
consistent with stress.</i>

43:02.811 --> 43:06.179
Your recent bereavement
is undoubtedly a factor

43:06.181 --> 43:08.749
but rather than prescribing
sleeping pills, perhaps...

43:08.751 --> 43:10.688
I'm also a teacher.

43:12.822 --> 43:14.992
One a night.

43:15.724 --> 43:16.923
You hear me?

43:16.925 --> 43:18.862
<i>Strictly one a night.</i>

44:20.789 --> 44:23.324
- <i>Come on, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Yeah, come on, Daddy.</i>

44:23.326 --> 44:25.126
<i>Don't just lie there
like a big lump.</i>

44:25.128 --> 44:27.327
<i>Help Mommy build..
What's it called again?</i>

44:27.329 --> 44:29.599
- A moat.
- <i>A moat.</i>

44:31.201 --> 44:34.271
Look, Molly, Daddy's diggin'.

44:36.206 --> 44:37.371
Daddy's a dipstick, huh?

44:37.373 --> 44:40.277
Molly, get the bucket,
go get some water.

44:41.077 --> 44:43.013
<i>Run. Run, run, run.</i>

44:45.581 --> 44:47.882
<i>I'm sorry, did we wake you?</i>

44:47.884 --> 44:49.717
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Huh.</i>

44:49.719 --> 44:51.619
Cut the tortured writer crap.

44:51.621 --> 44:53.557
You're complex, I get it.

44:58.695 --> 45:00.297
<i>Flags, Mommy.</i>

45:10.873 --> 45:12.809
How did you get that?

45:15.911 --> 45:17.043
Ah.

45:17.045 --> 45:19.045
- Big hug, huh?
- Big hug.

45:21.016 --> 45:22.285
Don't let go.

46:04.059 --> 46:07.061
If I had died..

46:07.063 --> 46:09.333
...wouldn't you try
to contact me?

46:12.101 --> 46:14.104
'Cause I'd find a way.

46:16.338 --> 46:17.607
I would.

46:25.614 --> 46:28.050
I'm sorry I said
those things to you.

47:09.324 --> 47:11.060
<i>A moat.</i>

47:46.195 --> 47:47.695
<i>Time travel?</i>

47:47.697 --> 47:50.697
Jesus, Ben, I teach physics,
not science fiction.

47:50.699 --> 47:52.666
To a particular point.

47:52.668 --> 47:54.101
One particular day.

47:54.103 --> 47:55.903
I mean Hawking
said it's possible

47:55.905 --> 47:57.003
he said that, didn't he?

47:57.005 --> 47:58.338
Yeah, he also said that

47:58.340 --> 48:00.374
if time travel
were to ever exist

48:00.376 --> 48:02.976
then we probably would have
already met time travelers.

48:02.978 --> 48:05.211
- Maybe we have.
- <i>An infinite universe?</i>

48:05.213 --> 48:07.882
<i>I guess anything's possible.</i>

48:07.884 --> 48:09.684
Whatever you're working on,
it sounds mad

48:09.686 --> 48:11.622
I can't wait to read it.

48:13.222 --> 48:14.291
You okay?

48:15.925 --> 48:16.927
I'm fine.

48:28.603 --> 48:31.207
Everybody,
just open your books.

48:39.916 --> 48:42.349
- You can't just burst in here.
- This is important.

48:42.351 --> 48:44.184
How do I pull the cameras up?

48:44.186 --> 48:46.420
A phone's been stolen.
Denise, right?

48:46.422 --> 48:48.555
- Bernice.
- Bernice, can you help me?

48:48.557 --> 48:50.494
Don't know about this.

48:52.362 --> 48:54.362
Great, can I? Thanks.

49:02.371 --> 49:05.039
- Come on.
- What do you think you're doing?

49:05.041 --> 49:08.342
Mr. Slater says a phone's been
stolen from his classroom.

49:08.344 --> 49:10.947
You have no right
to access that computer.

49:12.849 --> 49:15.215
<i>Mr. Slater, I am asking you
for the last time...</i>

49:15.217 --> 49:17.952
Give me a Goddamn second,
will you?

49:27.563 --> 49:28.532
Jesus.

49:30.065 --> 49:31.033
Stop.

50:41.570 --> 50:42.838
<i>Molly, wait!</i>

50:49.811 --> 50:51.080
<i>Molly!</i>

51:21.043 --> 51:22.012
Ben.

51:27.717 --> 51:30.550
It's the one bit of Latin
that everybody knows.

51:30.552 --> 51:33.621
<i>Carpe diem,</i> seize the day.

51:33.623 --> 51:37.258
Yeah, except it's "Seas."
S-E-A-S.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.059
I've been seeing
it everywhere.

51:39.061 --> 51:40.997
It's like the words
are haunting me.

51:43.365 --> 51:45.900
Look, if you're hoping
I'd perform an exorcism..

51:45.902 --> 51:48.101
Well, I'm sorry, my friend

51:48.103 --> 51:49.603
<i>but the pope relieved me
of those duties</i>

51:49.605 --> 51:50.873
<i>many years ago.</i>

51:57.646 --> 51:59.748
<i>Jesus, you're doin' all right,
aren't you?</i>

52:03.719 --> 52:05.655
Right, here we are.

52:13.963 --> 52:16.133
Oi, Ben, come here to me.

52:23.271 --> 52:26.740
Go and see a shrink,
you fucking lunatic.

52:41.224 --> 52:42.192
Hazel?

52:53.702 --> 52:54.670
Hazel?

53:19.494 --> 53:22.862
Oh, Benjamin Bunny.

53:22.864 --> 53:24.565
- Hi, baby.
- Hm.

53:24.567 --> 53:27.101
<i>Lose the shoes,
join the party.</i>

53:27.103 --> 53:30.271
I found it
in your jacket pocket.

53:30.273 --> 53:31.405
Weren't you gonna share?

53:31.407 --> 53:33.974
I confiscated that
from a kid at school.

53:33.976 --> 53:37.478
- Ooh.
- Hm, confiscate some more.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.750
- <i>It's good shit.</i>
- <i>It's so good.</i>

53:45.288 --> 53:47.224
Alright, give me some of that.

53:50.726 --> 53:51.695
Hm.

54:02.505 --> 54:04.438
Jesus.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.539
How long's it been?

54:06.541 --> 54:08.978
- A long time.
- Hm.

54:10.679 --> 54:14.414
In college we used to smoke
every single night.

54:14.416 --> 54:16.316
Not every single night.

54:16.318 --> 54:19.353
I mean, m... maybe you did
but I... I was innocent.

54:19.355 --> 54:21.155
You were never that innocent.

54:21.157 --> 54:22.690
<i>People always thought
I was the wild one.</i>

54:22.692 --> 54:24.191
<i>Because you are.</i>

54:24.193 --> 54:26.129
Give me that.

54:34.737 --> 54:36.537
<i>Serena has a secret.</i>

54:36.539 --> 54:39.039
<i>No. No, Hazel.</i>

54:39.041 --> 54:42.312
Serena is not
who you think she is.

54:52.755 --> 54:57.193
Serena is not her real name.

54:59.494 --> 55:01.764
Oh. Really?

55:03.199 --> 55:05.135
What's your real name?

55:05.634 --> 55:06.603
Rose.

55:09.871 --> 55:11.637
Rose, okay.

55:11.639 --> 55:14.340
Yeah, I named her Serena
on the first day of college.

55:14.342 --> 55:16.510
- Mm-hm.
- Uh-huh.

55:16.512 --> 55:18.782
A rose by any other name..

55:22.083 --> 55:25.187
...is still a rose.

55:38.067 --> 55:41.170
Ah, I love chocolate.

55:46.708 --> 55:49.642
Who knew chocolate
could taste so good?

55:49.644 --> 55:51.748
We have to put this
on the menu.

55:53.715 --> 55:56.318
I always think of my mother
when I bake.

56:04.994 --> 56:06.596
Hey, what's wrong?

56:08.764 --> 56:10.032
What is it?

56:11.833 --> 56:12.999
The dancer.

56:15.137 --> 56:17.804
What's going on?
Hey, it's okay.

56:20.443 --> 56:22.379
<i>Oh, it's okay, it's okay.</i>

56:23.878 --> 56:25.981
<i>Shh.</i>

56:28.150 --> 56:30.086
There's something
she's not telling me.

56:31.519 --> 56:33.787
Something terrible.

56:33.789 --> 56:35.688
I asked her
why she cut herself

56:35.690 --> 56:37.391
and you know what she said?

56:37.393 --> 56:38.958
Hm.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.494
That she was doing penance.

56:41.496 --> 56:44.430
- For what?
- Uh..

56:44.432 --> 56:46.432
You need to be nicer to her.

56:46.434 --> 56:49.202
- I'm always nice to her.
- No, you're not.

56:49.204 --> 56:51.304
I know she can be hard work
sometimes.

56:51.306 --> 56:52.908
You think?

56:54.577 --> 56:57.778
You know, in her eyes,
I had it all.

56:57.780 --> 57:01.581
A beautiful house,
beautiful child.

57:01.583 --> 57:02.851
Perfect husband.

57:03.885 --> 57:05.822
And I did for a while.

57:07.789 --> 57:09.726
She's here because
she's lost..

57:12.427 --> 57:14.894
...and I'm glad she's here.

57:14.896 --> 57:16.762
No, really, I am, it's..

57:16.764 --> 57:18.233
It's given me perspective.

57:20.101 --> 57:23.804
You know, there were days when
I didn't think I could go on.

57:23.806 --> 57:26.242
It would have been
so much easier to just..

57:27.576 --> 57:29.543
You remember how many pills
they prescribed me?

57:29.545 --> 57:31.481
Don't talk like that.

57:32.514 --> 57:34.451
But I don't feel
that way anymore.

57:36.918 --> 57:39.021
I feel like I can live again.

57:46.394 --> 57:48.331
There's something
I wanna show you.

57:48.898 --> 57:49.865
What?

57:51.500 --> 57:52.501
Come on.

57:53.501 --> 57:55.438
No, you tell me first.

57:57.438 --> 57:59.338
You trust me?

57:59.340 --> 58:01.374
You're wasted.

58:01.376 --> 58:02.476
Answer.

58:02.478 --> 58:04.414
You trust me, right?

58:06.715 --> 58:07.684
Yes.

58:10.119 --> 58:12.151
Come, you won't regret it.

58:12.153 --> 58:13.422
You're crazy.

58:21.697 --> 58:22.699
Come on.

58:27.101 --> 58:29.570
Where are we going?

58:29.572 --> 58:30.840
Right here.

58:34.976 --> 58:37.246
Careful. Okay?

58:41.250 --> 58:43.353
- Okay.
- Babe, it's a little cold.

58:44.253 --> 58:46.753
Stay, sit.

58:46.755 --> 58:48.858
Okay, in the dark?

58:49.791 --> 58:50.759
Ah.

58:52.460 --> 58:55.494
What's gotten into you?

58:55.496 --> 58:56.662
Remember when you said
there wasn't

58:56.664 --> 58:58.601
enough magic in the world?

58:59.434 --> 59:00.402
Yeah.

59:03.472 --> 59:06.873
Okay, this is not
what I had in mind.

59:06.875 --> 59:09.376
Promise me you won't get mad.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.979
Just hear me out.

59:11.981 --> 59:13.583
Something's happening, Hazel.

59:15.818 --> 59:17.754
Something I can't explain.

59:18.786 --> 59:21.220
The day at the beach.

59:21.222 --> 59:24.758
Something from that day
is still with me.

59:24.760 --> 59:27.159
I keep getting pulled back
to that one day

59:27.161 --> 59:29.097
and I don't know why.

59:31.065 --> 59:33.001
I know this sounds crazy..

59:34.402 --> 59:36.338
...but if you're with me..

59:37.572 --> 59:40.206
I need you, Hazel.

59:40.208 --> 59:42.644
Do this with me, please.

59:46.614 --> 59:48.884
What do you want me to do?

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:14.376
Come.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.486
I'm not crazy, Hazel.

01:01:01.023 --> 01:01:02.959
I don't know why..

01:01:05.059 --> 01:01:07.163
...maybe it just doesn't work
with two people.

01:01:08.963 --> 01:01:11.363
But I've been there.

01:01:11.365 --> 01:01:15.101
I've been to a place
where Molly's still alive..

01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:17.105
...and we get
that second life.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.144
Don't you think I want that?

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.615
I want that more than anything.

01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:31.617
What I wouldn't give for an
ordinary minute in a universe

01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:33.556
where Molly isn't dead.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.960
But she's dead, Ben.

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.748
- Big hug. Ugh..
- What are you doing?

01:02:18.199 --> 01:02:20.135
We have to get off
the beach now.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.177
Don't go, stay with me.

01:02:32.713 --> 01:02:33.682
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:02:35.516 --> 01:02:36.518
<i>Don't go.</i>

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:09.682
- Come on.
- Ugh!

01:03:11.552 --> 01:03:13.253
- We have to get off the beach now!
- <i>What's wrong with you?</i>

01:03:13.255 --> 01:03:14.354
<i>Come on.</i>

01:03:14.356 --> 01:03:15.691
Oh, no!

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:21.864
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do!

01:03:34.775 --> 01:03:36.378
Hazel. Hey!

01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:39.246
How did I get this scar?

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.146
Ben, we have
the opening tomorrow.

01:03:41.148 --> 01:03:43.585
- I need to sleep.
- The scar, how did I get it?

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.291
You fell on the beach.

01:03:49.657 --> 01:03:51.594
The day we built sandcastles.

01:03:54.362 --> 01:03:55.964
You don't remember?

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:27.195
Guess they all took
a wrong turn somewhere.

01:04:28.163 --> 01:04:30.863
Mr. Miller is taking your class.

01:04:30.865 --> 01:04:31.833
Yeah.

01:04:35.836 --> 01:04:38.608
This hasn't been an easy time
for you, Ben, has it?

01:04:40.275 --> 01:04:42.878
<i>I know you've been
under a lot of stress.</i>

01:04:44.112 --> 01:04:46.079
Am I about to be fired?

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:49.048
You confiscated something
in the yard a few days ago.

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.853
A controlled substance.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.454
What did you do with it?

01:04:54.456 --> 01:04:55.724
I smoked it.

01:04:57.659 --> 01:04:58.927
- You...
- Smoked it.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:02.298
You're not making this easy,
Ben.

01:05:03.764 --> 01:05:05.701
Let me fix that for ya.

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.675
I read your book.

01:06:23.677 --> 01:06:25.979
"A Reality Delusion."

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:27.546
Nice title.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:29.485
Some weighty themes in there.

01:06:30.518 --> 01:06:32.351
A futility of existence.

01:06:32.353 --> 01:06:34.789
All of us dropped
in the meaningless universe.

01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:37.891
A little hectic.

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:41.293
But the age old themes
have such a bearing resonance

01:06:41.295 --> 01:06:42.564
don't you think?

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:47.202
What, a guy who dances
with furniture shouldn't read?

01:06:48.969 --> 01:06:50.869
It's just my face
when I meet someone

01:06:50.871 --> 01:06:52.704
that's actually read my book.

01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:54.643
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:06:55.409 --> 01:06:59.112
You can write... you can.

01:06:59.114 --> 01:07:01.050
But you're overthinking
everything.

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:03.550
Oh, yeah?

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.017
Yeah.

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:07.920
I mean, there's you..

01:07:07.922 --> 01:07:10.657
...struggling with the weight
of your pain..

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:13.226
...grappling in the shadows

01:07:13.228 --> 01:07:16.231
without understanding the forces
governing your existence.

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:22.034
We all earned our own
early pathway

01:07:22.036 --> 01:07:24.139
our course is set
long before we are.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:28.277
But sadly,
some of us go astray.

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:33.947
But those who do,
pay a heavy price.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.385
<i>And all come back
to the fold.</i>

01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:39.853
What is it?

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:42.155
Please tell me.

01:07:42.157 --> 01:07:45.657
It's something so immense
it can't hold a name.

01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:47.760
You just embrace it, Ben.

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:49.198
I've tried..

01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:52.932
I've really tried..

01:07:52.934 --> 01:07:54.870
...but I'm doing something
wrong.

01:07:55.903 --> 01:07:57.239
I don't know, but..

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:01.541
...it never brings me back
to that day.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:03.108
It's always a different day

01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:04.911
but I can't change anything.

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:08.516
I just can't... change anything.

01:08:33.608 --> 01:08:35.877
<i>Our course is set
long before we are.</i>

01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:32.966
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.801
What happened to you?

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.136
I called the school,
they said you quit.

01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:40.073
What's he doing here?

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:43.843
David is a psychologist.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.377
He's been helping me

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.312
and I think
he can help you too.

01:09:47.314 --> 01:09:50.282
Ben, if you wanna talk,
we can talk.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:51.416
What did you tell him, Hazel?

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:52.951
Did you tell him
that I'm going crazy?

01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:55.120
I told him you need help.

01:09:55.122 --> 01:09:57.423
- Because?
- Because you do, look at you.

01:09:57.425 --> 01:09:59.558
Because I'm crazy, say it!

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.329
Yes, you're crazy,
and you're making me crazy!

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:05.632
Don't you see everything
is falling apart?

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:06.833
You need help, Ben!

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:10.769
No, I need support from you,
from my wife.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:14.040
- I can't, I can't do this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:15.607
- It's okay.
- Get out of my fuck...

01:10:15.609 --> 01:10:16.578
Ben!

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.479
Ben, just let me help you.

01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:23.081
Just get out of my house.

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:25.019
Man, just think about what
you're doing.

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:27.320
He's just here to help us.

01:10:27.322 --> 01:10:29.257
We don't need his help, okay?

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.294
We need.. We just..

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:42.371
Don't you hear that?

01:10:44.572 --> 01:10:46.507
Tell me you hear that.

01:10:48.009 --> 01:10:49.944
Does anybody hear
what I'm hearing?

01:10:54.948 --> 01:10:56.884
<i>Please, I think
you should all leave.</i>

01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:00.956
Ah.

01:11:07.194 --> 01:11:09.161
Tell me you hear that!

01:11:09.163 --> 01:11:10.263
<i>Tell me!</i>

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:12.201
- Ben.
- Do you hear it?

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:20.643
Where's,
where's the fucking thing?

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:26.581
What are you doing?

01:11:30.784 --> 01:11:32.151
Where the fuck is it?

01:11:32.153 --> 01:11:33.652
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:12:44.859 --> 01:12:46.425
What have you done?

01:12:46.427 --> 01:12:48.628
Would you fuck me now?

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.899
- Don't, Serena.
- Would you?

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.733
You wanted to fuck me so bad
that day..

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:58.403
You wanted to lick
every inch of me..

01:12:58.405 --> 01:13:00.339
...that's what you said.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.277
That's what you said.

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:03.776
Serena.

01:13:13.654 --> 01:13:15.086
Hazel.

01:13:15.088 --> 01:13:16.425
I'm so sorry.

01:13:21.695 --> 01:13:22.663
Hazel?

01:13:23.864 --> 01:13:25.800
Hazel, open the door.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.173
Hazel!

01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:34.943
<i>Haz..</i>

01:13:37.377 --> 01:13:41.080
- Jesus Christ. No, baby.
- Oh, my God.

01:13:41.082 --> 01:13:43.182
What did you tell her? Huh?

01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:44.186
I didn't.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.362
Hold on, baby, hold on.

01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:32.134
Mr. Slater.

01:14:39.207 --> 01:14:40.639
- You're the guy from..
- <i>Kevin.</i>

01:14:40.641 --> 01:14:42.577
<i>Kevin Gunne,
pleased to meet you.</i>

01:14:47.114 --> 01:14:48.580
Are you okay?

01:14:48.582 --> 01:14:50.049
Were you in an accident?

01:14:50.051 --> 01:14:51.217
How's Hazel?

01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.451
- How's she doing?
- Your wife is fine.

01:14:53.453 --> 01:14:56.321
Were you able to get that
shit out of her system?

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:57.589
This shit?

01:14:57.591 --> 01:14:59.491
Terol L-glutamate

01:14:59.493 --> 01:15:01.294
also known as folic acid

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:03.795
not exactly overdose material.

01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:05.132
Hazel's been depressed..

01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:08.401
...mixing a lot of medication..

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.968
She's anemic.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.370
Nothing to panic about

01:15:11.372 --> 01:15:13.039
she's got a nasty bump
on the back of her head

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.407
from when she blacked out.

01:15:15.409 --> 01:15:17.412
Why don't you sit down again?

01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:21.849
I'll be right back.

01:15:27.788 --> 01:15:29.724
Can I, can I see her?

01:15:48.309 --> 01:15:50.942
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Slater, do you mind?

01:15:50.944 --> 01:15:52.878
I'd just like to..

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.849
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:15:55.582 --> 01:15:56.851
Have a look.

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:03.990
Where's Serena?

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.927
Now, the other eye.

01:16:11.832 --> 01:16:13.434
I just can't.

01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:18.173
I just need..

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:24.078
<i>Ben, what are you doing here?</i>

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:26.347
Everything okay?

01:17:47.828 --> 01:17:48.827
Ben!

01:18:11.985 --> 01:18:13.921
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:17.859
I'm so, so sorry.

01:18:22.329 --> 01:18:25.130
I killed her, Sean..

01:18:25.132 --> 01:18:27.068
...the same way I killed Molly.

01:18:28.668 --> 01:18:29.637
Ben..

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:31.739
Oh, Ben.

01:18:34.175 --> 01:18:36.110
But now I know.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.382
I know.

01:18:52.859 --> 01:18:54.795
You remember the reading?

01:18:56.063 --> 01:18:57.998
<i>At mass, the day we met?</i>

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:03.237
"Here is my redemption."

01:19:05.773 --> 01:19:07.708
This is my wish.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:50.115
<i>Come on, Daddy.</i>

01:19:50.117 --> 01:19:51.750
<i>Yeah, come on, Daddy.</i>

01:19:51.752 --> 01:19:53.419
<i>Don't just lie there
like a big lump.</i>

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.254
<i>Help Mommy build..
What's it called again?</i>

01:19:55.256 --> 01:19:57.192
- <i>A moat.</i>
- <i>A moat.</i>

01:20:00.927 --> 01:20:02.428
A boat?

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.829
<i>A moat, dipstick.</i>

01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:05.330
- Daddy's a dipstick.
- Ooh.

01:20:05.332 --> 01:20:06.732
Oh, is that so?

01:20:06.734 --> 01:20:09.067
Well, you just watch this
dipstick dig, huh?

01:20:09.069 --> 01:20:10.736
Get the bucket,
go get some water.

01:20:10.738 --> 01:20:12.871
"Molly, get the bucket,
Molly, get the water."

01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:15.374
What would you do
if I wasn't here?

01:20:15.376 --> 01:20:16.645
<i>Run, run, run.</i>

01:20:20.014 --> 01:20:21.949
I'm glad you could join us.

01:20:24.284 --> 01:20:26.220
Drop the tortured writer..

01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:30.125
Flags, mommy.

01:20:32.693 --> 01:20:33.695
Oh, yeah.

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.773
<i>Nice trick.</i>

01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:09.264
What's gotten into you?

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:14.903
<i>Come here.</i>

01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:16.567
Ah!

01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:19.506
- Ooh!
- Ah!

01:21:31.752 --> 01:21:33.251
Daddy's gonna go for a swim.

01:21:50.704 --> 01:21:52.236
Yeah, as quick as you can,
please.

01:21:52.238 --> 01:21:53.339
<i>Yes, sir, it's on the way.</i>

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:54.342
Thank you.

01:22:32.012 --> 01:22:33.948
Faster! Go faster!

01:22:45.693 --> 01:22:46.661
Hey!

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.140
Ben, look out!

01:23:43.951 --> 01:23:47.255
"The day.."

01:24:51.652 --> 01:24:52.851
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

01:24:52.853 --> 01:24:55.789
<i>and of the Son

"Give them eternal rest,
oh, Lord

01:25:00.194 --> 01:25:02.797
"may your perpetual light shine
on them forever.

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:05.664
<i>"Almighty God, our Father</i>

01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:07.933
<i>"we firmly believe

<i>died and rose to life.."</i>

01:26:53.873 --> 01:26:55.809
Are you sure you can
let the place go?

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.681
Yeah, too many memories.

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:06.921
Hey.

01:27:07.621 --> 01:27:08.890
<i>Come back here.</i>

01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:18.465
Prince?

Ben.
