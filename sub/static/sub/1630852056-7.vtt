00:00.400 --> 00:03.066
Someone used your debit card?

00:03.133 --> 00:06.300
We were dealing with each
other at the time and I thought

00:06.367 --> 00:08.734
I had known him for a while,
so I could trust him.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.500
Did you find her debit card?

00:11.800 --> 00:13.233
She may think you're cute. Not me.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.266
Sometimes when you're slick,
you stay slick.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.400
-You know?
-Yeah.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.100
[Kevin] Court come to order.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.133
Be seated, please.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.033
Hello, Judge.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.233
Case 104,1 Roberson versus Readus.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.567
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:59.967 --> 01:02.533
Ms. Roberson, during what period of time

01:02.600 --> 01:05.567
did you and the defendant
have a relationship?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.500
I would say from about

01:07.567 --> 01:10.967
June 2020 to August 2020.

01:11.033 --> 01:14.166
[Judy] And in what month was it

01:14.233 --> 01:16.600
that you needed a lift to the airport?

01:16.667 --> 01:19.433
That would have been March 2021.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.900
So I assume
that after the relationship was over,

01:21.967 --> 01:24.500
you continued to be involved?

01:24.567 --> 01:26.500
Yes, on and off.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.166
[Judy] Sometimes friends, sometimes more?

01:28.233 --> 01:29.233
[Ashley] Yes.

01:29.300 --> 01:32.500
During one of those periods of time

01:32.567 --> 01:35.233
when you were going to the airport,
what day in March was that?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.633
March 19th.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.667
[Judy] The defendant
was gonna take you to the airport,

01:38.734 --> 01:41.800
drive you to the airport,
and then according to you, drive home.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.967
But he had driven your car regularly.

01:44.033 --> 01:47.100
And he took you to the airport
and he dropped you off.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.533
And then you were in an accident?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.633
Yes, ma'am.

01:49.700 --> 01:50.700
[Judy] Serious one?

01:50.767 --> 01:52.233
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] On what date?

01:53.433 --> 01:54.533
March 31st.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.734
And you were hospitalized.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.800
You were in a coma for a long time?

01:57.867 --> 02:00.667
Yeah. About ten to eight day...
eight to ten days.

02:00.734 --> 02:01.834
[Judy]
Still getting physical therapy?

02:01.900 --> 02:03.066
Yes, ma'am.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.767
[Judy] So there are two parts
to your case.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.000
One part of your case,

02:07.066 --> 02:10.600
and you were out of town
between the 19th and the 31st.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.800
I flew home May 12th, it would be.

02:12.867 --> 02:16.066
So it would have been
from March 19th to May 12th.

02:16.133 --> 02:21.000
But you were definitely out of town
between March 19th and March 31st?

02:21.066 --> 02:22.066
Correct.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.767
That's what I'm talking about.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.300
On March 19th,
he had this terrible accident,

02:27.367 --> 02:28.900
your car was totaled.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.700
You only had liability
and not collision on the car,

02:31.767 --> 02:35.133
so the car was lost.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.667
The defendant was hospitalized
for a while, in rehab for a while.

02:39.734 --> 02:42.633
You were aware of that,
you were made aware of that.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.834
Now he's better, still has a way to go.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.100
But better.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.667
You want him to pay
for the value of the car

02:48.734 --> 02:52.367
and you also say that during the period

02:52.433 --> 02:55.100
between March 19th and March 31st,

02:55.166 --> 02:57.400
someone used your debit card

02:57.467 --> 03:00.967
in a place where you were not.

03:01.033 --> 03:05.600
And it is your belief that the defendant
used the debit card that was in your car.

03:05.667 --> 03:09.333
Interestingly, the defendant
does not deny he used the debit card.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.467
But he says that he used it
for things that you authorized.

03:12.533 --> 03:13.533
Uh-hmm.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.333
-That's your defense. Am I correct?
-Yes.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.834
Okey-dokey.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.667
So let's start at the beginning.

03:19.734 --> 03:23.166
The beginning is he had the car
with your permission?

03:23.233 --> 03:25.000
Car or card? I'm sorry.

03:25.066 --> 03:26.633
-Car.
-[Ashley] Okay.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.533
He had the car with your permission.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.367
He drove you to the airport.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.567
He was gonna pick you up from the airport.

03:32.633 --> 03:33.667
Incorrect.

03:33.734 --> 03:35.767
[Judy] Had he ever taken you
to the airport before?

03:35.834 --> 03:36.800
No.

03:36.867 --> 03:38.333
[Judy] So tell me about
the arrangements you made for him

03:38.400 --> 03:39.967
to take you to the airport,

03:40.033 --> 03:41.834
understanding
that you were going to be away

03:41.900 --> 03:45.166
from mid-March until May.

03:45.233 --> 03:46.300
Go ahead. Let me hear.

03:46.367 --> 03:49.233
So, I had no one to take me to the airport

03:49.300 --> 03:51.800
and we were dealing
with each other at the time.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.233
And I thought I had known him for a while

03:54.300 --> 03:56.333
so I could trust him
to take me to the airport.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.467
And he was to drop the car
back off at my mom's or my cousin's,

04:00.533 --> 04:01.734
whichever worked best for him.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.133
I was trying to work with him.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.667
And so he was never... he never did that,

04:06.734 --> 04:09.333
and I texted him, and I called him,

04:09.400 --> 04:12.600
and I said, you know,
"You need to bring the car home and...

04:12.667 --> 04:13.900
[Judy] I'd like to see

04:13.967 --> 04:18.000
when between March 19th and March 31st

04:18.066 --> 04:20.166
you texted him, that I would like to see.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.200
So...

04:21.266 --> 04:22.233
[Judy]
Just a sec, don't say anything.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.233
[Ashley] Okay.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.300
Just show me.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.233
It's this one right here.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.300
[Judy] Thank you.

04:35.633 --> 04:36.500
I don't know what date this is.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.667
It says Friday at 2:47,

04:38.734 --> 04:41.600
yesterday at 9:59 in the morning.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.066
[Ashley] Unfortunately,
there are no dates on them

04:44.133 --> 04:47.166
because these
were screenshots of messages...

04:47.233 --> 04:49.233
Screenshots of what messages?

04:49.300 --> 04:50.333
Of whose messages?

04:50.400 --> 04:51.467
Between Ronne and I.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.600
[Judy] Well, let me see the phone.

04:53.667 --> 04:57.066
-Oh, the messages are deleted.
-[Judy] Oh.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.934
-So, that doesn't matter?
-[Judy] Forget it. Forget it.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.433
-Okay.
-Okay. Forget the car.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.033
Forget the car. The car's gone.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.400
Okay.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.567
[Judy]
He had permission to drive your car.

05:06.633 --> 05:09.567
And unless you have
some sort of police report

05:09.633 --> 05:13.233
indicating that the accident
was his fault, which I gather it was not.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.500
A tire blew.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.333
-Did a tire blow on the car?
-Yes, ma'am.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.033
[Judy]
And you lost control of the car?

05:19.100 --> 05:20.066
Yes, ma'am.

05:20.133 --> 05:22.800
Okay, you have any information
to the contrary?

05:22.867 --> 05:25.934
When you say that,
what do you mean exactly?

05:26.000 --> 05:30.400
Exactly, he says that a tire blew
on the car which caused the accident.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.467
[Ashley] Uh-hmm.

05:31.533 --> 05:32.667
Do you have any information to the...

05:32.734 --> 05:34.767
that would not be his fault.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.533
If the tire blew on the car...

05:36.600 --> 05:37.533
Yes.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.233
[Judy] ...that would not be his fault.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.867
What I can say and I don't know
if that would work for you

05:41.934 --> 05:44.834
is that the reason the tire popped
is because he was driving

05:44.900 --> 05:47.200
around on a donut on my car

05:47.266 --> 05:50.133
that he never even told me occurred.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.100
-Oh, just a second.
-[Ashley] Go ahead. Yeah.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.834
[Judy] Just a second.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.266
Did you have a flat tire?

05:55.333 --> 05:56.333
Yes.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.066
Oh.

05:58.133 --> 06:00.467
On what date did you have a flat tire?

06:01.633 --> 06:02.600
The day of the accident.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.100
Earlier in the day,
I had changed a tire that day.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.834
It's either March 30th or March 31st.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.333
It was the date
that the car tire had popped.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.767
I had changed it the same day.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.333
Who changed the tire?

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
Me.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.400
Who put on the donut?

06:17.467 --> 06:18.867
I put on the donut.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.667
Your father getting all this?

06:23.734 --> 06:25.767
-You getting embarrassed?
-It's getting there.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.600
-It's getting there?
-Yes, ma'am.

06:27.667 --> 06:28.934
Yes, ma'am.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.433
My grandmother would say
"Give him a good slap," get his attention.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.600
He's getting too big for that.

06:53.233 --> 06:54.233
[Judy] Keep going.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.300
[Ashley] The reason the tire popped
is because he was driving

06:56.367 --> 06:58.700
around on a donut on my car

06:58.767 --> 07:01.834
that he never even told me occurred.

-[Ashley] Go ahead. Yeah.

07:03.633 --> 07:04.834
Just a second.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.200
Did you have a flat tire?

07:06.266 --> 07:07.266
Yes.

07:07.633 --> 07:08.800
Oh.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.166
On what date did you have a flat tire?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.066
The day of the accident.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.934
Earlier in the day,
I had changed a tire that day.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.367
It's either March 30th, or March 31st.

07:18.433 --> 07:21.000
It was the date
that the car tire had popped.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.734
I had changed it the same day.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.266
Who changed the tire?

07:24.333 --> 07:25.567
Me.

07:25.633 --> 07:27.100
[Judy] Who put on the donut?

07:27.166 --> 07:28.367
I put on the donut.

07:29.734 --> 07:31.567
Who's this gentleman?

07:31.633 --> 07:32.767
-Who's he?
-[Judy] Yeah.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.266
Oh, this is my father.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.133
You have to introduce your son
to the truth.

07:38.433 --> 07:41.500
Say, "Truth, I'd like you to meet my son."

07:42.600 --> 07:45.033
Because in his answer,

07:45.100 --> 07:48.967
what he says is that she didn't tell him

07:49.033 --> 07:51.600
that there was a donut tire.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.967
I'm gonna read you
what he said in his answer.

07:55.033 --> 07:58.934
"Ashley failed to tell me that her car
was in poor working condition

07:59.000 --> 08:03.600
and that one of the tires
was a temporary donut tire."

08:03.667 --> 08:04.934
Well, he put it on.

08:06.266 --> 08:07.233
Yeah.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.900
[laughs] Good.

08:09.934 --> 08:11.967
On the night of the accident,
I was driving down the highway

08:12.033 --> 08:14.467
and suddenly the spare tire blew,

08:14.533 --> 08:16.166
and I spun out of control.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.934
Well, according to him,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.867
now because he doesn't have a good memory.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.367
He changed the tire.

08:23.433 --> 08:26.500
He doesn't remember exactly
when but clearly what he didn't do

08:26.567 --> 08:30.700
was change the tire and the next thing,
go to a tire shop

08:31.734 --> 08:33.500
and get another tire.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.500
So he's driving around
with a little spare.

08:36.567 --> 08:37.567
What?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.667
If I could have got another tire,
I would have.

08:40.734 --> 08:41.734
The time...

08:41.800 --> 08:43.500
the timeframe
within like the tire had popped,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.767
it was already night time.
So I couldn't...

08:45.834 --> 08:49.233
You told me you didn't remember
whether it was the 30th or the 31st.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.834
You just told me that a second ago.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.667
Just because I didn't remember the date,
I don't remember...

08:53.734 --> 08:55.734
like I remember like what time like...

08:55.800 --> 08:57.300
No, it's not time and date that you...

08:57.367 --> 08:59.433
on the 31st, you almost got killed.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.900
So you would remember whether or not

09:01.967 --> 09:05.300
you changed the tire
on the 30th or the 31st.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.500
You know, she may think you're cute,
not me.

09:07.567 --> 09:08.600
[Ashley] Uh-uh.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.033
[Judy] I have to tell you.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.233
[Eric and audience laugh]

09:12.767 --> 09:13.767
Not me.

09:14.867 --> 09:18.266
Now, when you got in her car,
did you find her debit card?

09:18.333 --> 09:20.900
Because you acknowledge that you used it.

09:20.967 --> 09:21.967
I didn't find it.

09:22.033 --> 09:25.633
She had called me and let me know
she left her debit card in her car.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.100
Oh, perfect.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.500
Oh, I'm gonna love this.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.500
[Ashley] Uh-hmm.

09:32.033 --> 09:36.600
She called you and said,
"I left my debit card in the car."

09:36.667 --> 09:39.367
Was that when she first left
around the 19th?

09:39.433 --> 09:40.367
[Ronne] Yes, ma'am.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.066
[Judy] And what else
did she say when she said,

09:43.133 --> 09:46.033
"I left my debit card in the car"?

09:46.100 --> 09:48.333
She had asked me
to get the oil changed on her car.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.834
[Judy] And did you do that?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.033
Yeah.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.033
Not "yeah"
would be an answer that you give me.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.600
-[Ronne] Yes, ma'am.
-Yes?

09:54.667 --> 09:55.600
-Perfect.
-Yes, ma'am.

09:55.667 --> 09:56.734
[Judy] You got the oil change.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.100
Do you remember,
was that the beginning of her trip

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
that she asked you to get the oil change?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.633
Yes, ma'am.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.800
[Judy] Okay.

10:02.867 --> 10:05.700
She also said in this thing,
it doesn't have the date,

10:05.767 --> 10:07.367
but let's say it's legitimate.

10:07.433 --> 10:10.333
She says,
"You're gonna have to return the car."

10:10.400 --> 10:13.066
She says,
"You can drop it off at Marcus's house

10:13.133 --> 10:15.133
if that's easier for you."

10:15.200 --> 10:17.000
And you write back.

10:17.066 --> 10:18.433
You know what she's talking about?

10:19.834 --> 10:22.100
It's not coming back all the way.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.400
Please continue, please.

10:23.467 --> 10:25.800
"You need to take my car home

10:25.867 --> 10:28.633
and you can drop it off in El...

10:28.700 --> 10:29.533
-[Ashley] Cajon.
-[Ronne] El Cajon.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.467
[Judy] El Cajon at Marcus's house
if that's easier for you.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.333
Do you know who that is? Marcus?

10:35.400 --> 10:36.834
Yes.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.100
All righty.

10:38.166 --> 10:42.900
And you wrote back, you know,
a very intelligent, well-crafted answer.

10:42.967 --> 10:45.033
You write back, guess what?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.100
What do you think you wrote back?

10:47.367 --> 10:49.000
-I can't remember.
-"No gas."

10:50.700 --> 10:51.767
That was your answer.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.266
That's what he wrote back.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.633
"No gas."

10:59.700 --> 11:01.400
And she says,

11:01.467 --> 11:05.800
"Find some and I'll send you $20."

11:05.867 --> 11:06.834
Okay.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.433
You know what you answered her?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.533
I do not.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.300
You want me to tell your father?

11:11.367 --> 11:12.266
Please.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.433
[Judy] His answer was, "Like 50."

11:17.066 --> 11:18.233
Got it?

11:18.300 --> 11:20.500
[Eric] Yeah, full tank.

11:20.567 --> 11:21.467
[Judy] What?

11:21.533 --> 11:22.767
For a full tank, I guess.

11:22.834 --> 11:23.667
[Ronne] Yup.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.367
She wasn't driving the car.

11:29.433 --> 11:30.400
He was.

11:30.467 --> 11:31.400
Yeah.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.967
Twenty was enough to get it
to Marcus's house.

11:36.133 --> 11:39.367
I'd like to see your credit card
or your debit card

11:39.433 --> 11:42.800
for what was purchased between the...

11:45.300 --> 11:47.400
-They're in order. You're welcome.
-19th and the 31st.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.667
They're in order for you.

11:58.934 --> 12:01.300
[Judy] Well, let's see.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.467
Something at Walmart

12:03.533 --> 12:06.734
at El Cajon for $17,

12:06.800 --> 12:09.500
then there was at another Walmart.

12:09.567 --> 12:14.133
This was an ATM cash withdrawal for $202,

12:14.200 --> 12:16.734
and that was also on the 20th.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.567
So that was the day after she left.

12:19.633 --> 12:22.467
Then you have a balance inquiry

12:22.533 --> 12:26.367
and another balance inquiry on the 20th.

12:26.433 --> 12:29.967
And then on the 22nd,

12:30.033 --> 12:32.200
this had nothing to do with oil,

12:32.266 --> 12:33.967
U Save Smoke Shop

12:34.767 --> 12:35.767
[Eric chuckles]

12:35.834 --> 12:38.633
in San Diego, California.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.900
And that was $143 cash withdrawal.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.266
Your father getting all of this?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.533
Are you getting embarrassed?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.333
It's getting there.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.333
-[Judy] It's getting there?
-Yes, ma'am. Yes.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.734
My grandmother would say,
"Give him a good slap

12:54.800 --> 12:55.700
to get his attention."

12:55.767 --> 12:56.900
He's getting too big for that.

12:57.633 --> 12:59.200
[groans]

12:59.266 --> 13:01.600
Then there was another cash withdrawal

13:01.667 --> 13:05.734
on the 21st of March in La Mesa.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.233
What were you doing in La Mesa
at a 7-Eleven?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.133
-Duh.
-[audience laughs]

13:12.200 --> 13:14.333
Then iWash Express,

13:14.400 --> 13:18.567
well, at least you had the car washed,
unless this was to clean yourself.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.734
-That was $16.
-[laughs]

13:24.367 --> 13:27.667
Your father already knows
that he missed his mark

13:27.734 --> 13:29.700
in introducing you to the truth

13:29.767 --> 13:32.200
and introducing you to honesty,
because certainly

13:32.266 --> 13:35.000
if she called and said,
"I left my debit card in the car,

13:35.066 --> 13:37.767
change my oil, you know,
use the debit card."

13:37.834 --> 13:39.734
Certainly taking friends to tacos

13:39.800 --> 13:42.567
doesn't qualify
as change the oil in my car.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.500
[theme music playing]

13:54.400 --> 13:58.700
[narrator] <i>Ashley Roberson is accusing</i>
<i>her former boyfriend Ronne Readus</i>

13:58.767 --> 14:02.667
<i>of crashing her car</i>
<i>and stealing money from her bank account.</i>

14:02.734 --> 14:06.967
Then there was another cash withdrawal
on the 21st of March

14:07.033 --> 14:08.700
in La Mesa.

14:08.767 --> 14:11.633
What were you doing in La Mesa
at a 7-Eleven?

14:12.667 --> 14:14.533
-Duh?
-[audience laughs]

14:14.600 --> 14:16.266
Then iWash Express,

14:16.333 --> 14:17.934
well at least you had the car washed

14:18.000 --> 14:20.567
unless this was to clean yourself.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.500
-That was $16.
-[laughs]

14:25.867 --> 14:30.500
Then we have on the 24th in El Cajon,

14:30.567 --> 14:33.166
an ATM cash withdrawal for $204.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.500
I assume the $4 is a fee.

14:35.567 --> 14:38.633
And then you went for tacos with friends

14:38.700 --> 14:41.066
to Los Castillos Taco Shop.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.166
You remember who you went with?

14:42.233 --> 14:44.400
Because you didn't need a loan for $32.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.800
You remember who you went with?

14:45.867 --> 14:46.734
No, ma'am.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.633
Can you guess?

14:48.700 --> 14:50.133
I can't tell you.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.433
[Judy] You can't tell me?

14:52.567 --> 14:53.600
I can't guess.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.633
[Judy] You can guess?

14:54.700 --> 14:55.667
I couldn't guess. I don't know.

14:55.734 --> 14:57.567
-I don't remember.
-[Judy] Oh, you couldn't guess.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.867
And then you went to Burlington Stores.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.667
What did you buy at Burlington Stores?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.633
Oh, I bought some jeans

15:04.700 --> 15:07.333
and then I had got her something
just sweet from me.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.967
And then you went to Yum-Yum Donuts

15:15.800 --> 15:18.567
in La Mesa for $1.99.

15:18.633 --> 15:22.867
And then on the same day,
you must have bought donuts for friends

15:22.934 --> 15:26.700
because on the same day,
you bought donuts for $13.99.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.900
What, you bought a coffee,
and then you bought a dozen donuts,

15:28.967 --> 15:30.166
what happened there?

15:30.233 --> 15:31.266
Yeah, I think it was something like that.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.967
Like a drink, not a coffee,
but a drink of some sort

15:34.033 --> 15:36.934
and then a little box of donuts.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.734
I didn't see anything here
about an oil change.

15:40.767 --> 15:41.834
It's coming up.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.233
It's coming up. Oh, there are more?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.800
Um, so there is something in there
for an oil change.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.700
But I wanna say that I did not
authorize him to get an oil change.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.233
What I had said to him...

15:50.300 --> 15:52.066
-[Judy] It doesn't...
-Okay. Okay. Sure.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.166
I'm just letting you know.

15:54.633 --> 15:56.967
Yeah, he took it upon himself
to get an oil change.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.467
How much were all these?

15:58.533 --> 16:00.600
You added them up to $900?

16:00.667 --> 16:03.233
[Ashley] It was $940 and about 26 cents.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.834
Okay, now let's get to the car.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.033
Okay.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.500
You have to understand,

16:08.567 --> 16:10.800
sometimes things
that look good on the outside,

16:10.867 --> 16:13.667
when you peel them back,
they really aren't any good.

16:13.734 --> 16:15.700
-[Ashley] Yeah.
-Yeah. They aren't any good.

16:15.767 --> 16:20.533
And sometimes,
when you're slick, you stay slick.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.200
-You know?
-Yeah.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.567
[Judy]
And sometimes when you're slick,

16:24.633 --> 16:27.834
because of your own negligence,

16:27.900 --> 16:30.166
you get into a bad accident

16:30.233 --> 16:31.900
and you end up in a coma.

16:31.967 --> 16:35.567
So if people are smart,
they would take that kind of experience

16:35.633 --> 16:39.533
and say, "I'm gonna change
the whole trajectory of my life.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.934
-I'm gonna make it all better."
-[Ashley] Right.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.533
-And some people don't learn.
-[Ashley] Right.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.567
Then they'd made...

16:44.633 --> 16:45.767
then they just replicate it.

16:45.834 --> 16:49.033
So we'll see
what kind of trajectory you take.

16:49.100 --> 16:53.600
Your father already knows
that he missed his mark in introducing you

16:53.667 --> 16:54.967
to the truth

16:55.033 --> 16:57.166
and introducing you to honesty

16:57.233 --> 16:58.700
because certainly if she called and said,

16:58.767 --> 17:00.900
"I left my debit card in the car,

17:00.967 --> 17:03.967
change my oil, you know,
use the debit card,"

17:04.033 --> 17:06.000
certainly taking friends to tacos

17:06.066 --> 17:07.867
and taking cash withdrawals

17:07.934 --> 17:11.033
doesn't qualify as change the oil
in my car.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.266
That's correct.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.467
[Judy] Right. Perfect.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.266
Now, what kind of car did you have?

17:15.333 --> 17:17.200
I had a 2006 Honda Civic.

17:17.266 --> 17:19.233
When did you buy it?

17:19.300 --> 17:21.934
I bought it in...

17:22.000 --> 17:23.834
am I allowed to look exactly on my phone?

17:23.900 --> 17:25.200
-Oh, sure.
-[Ashley] Okay.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.834
Did you save up money for it?

17:31.900 --> 17:32.800
Yeah, I did.

17:32.867 --> 17:33.967
[Judy] For how long?

17:34.033 --> 17:36.700
Um, probably about eight months.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.533
You're looking up
how much you paid for it.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.166
I paid $4,300.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.200
I was just looking to see what...

17:41.266 --> 17:42.300
when I had purchased the car

17:42.367 --> 17:43.533
so I could give you an accurate answer.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.467
[Judy] Okay.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.333
I purchased it August 1st of 2020.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.734
Do you still owe money on the car?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
No, I do not. I bought it in cash.

17:52.867 --> 17:53.967
Who did you buy it from?

17:54.033 --> 17:58.934
Honestly, some guy
in North County Escondido

17:59.000 --> 18:00.266
I think I wanna say.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.667
What kind of work do you do?

18:01.734 --> 18:03.300
I'm in school.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.233
I'm in college.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.433
So where did you get the money from?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.667
At the time, I was working and as well as

18:08.734 --> 18:12.900
I don't know if you're familiar
with unemployment for California.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.900
That was money
that I received from there and I work...

18:17.967 --> 18:19.934
I worked up, not worked.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.834
I worked up to save it. I didn't spend it.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.700
I saved, saved, saved
as they were giving me money and...

18:24.767 --> 18:26.800
As the state of California
was giving you money,

18:26.867 --> 18:28.633
you saved up and you bought the car?

18:28.700 --> 18:29.567
Yes, I did.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.467
I had no car.
I didn't know how else to get one.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.500
Okay. Where were you living?

18:34.567 --> 18:35.667
With my mom in San Diego.

18:35.734 --> 18:36.734
[Judy]
So you lived with your mother?

18:36.800 --> 18:37.867
Yes.

18:37.934 --> 18:39.934
And they were sending you
these thousands of dollars

18:40.000 --> 18:42.767
that you saved while you were living
with your mom and you bought this car?

18:42.834 --> 18:43.800
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.834
Gosh, America, I love it.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.533
Okay, 2006 Honda Civic.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.867
Three thousand to forty-seven hundred
is the range.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.700
[Judy] You're suing him for $3,100?

18:56.767 --> 18:57.834
Correct.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.500
You're entitled to $3,100.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.033
He negligently used your car.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.500
Even if he had permission to use your car,
which I think he did,

19:06.567 --> 19:08.300
he negligently used it.

19:08.367 --> 19:10.967
I don't know when he had a flat tire

19:11.033 --> 19:12.600
and when he put on this donut on the tire,

19:12.667 --> 19:14.667
but he's an idiot for driving around

19:14.734 --> 19:17.066
more than five miles
to find a shop where...

19:17.133 --> 19:18.734
-Right.
-[Judy] ...you can do that.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.700
Well, he paid substantially
for his stupidity

19:22.767 --> 19:27.200
by spending eight or ten days in a coma
and now he walks with an assist.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.200
And he's gonna need an awful lot
to get himself back into shape.

19:30.266 --> 19:32.200
So maybe he learned something.

19:32.266 --> 19:33.800
He also used your credit card,

19:33.867 --> 19:36.100
your debit card
without your authorization.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.166
I think he has to compensate you for both.

19:38.233 --> 19:41.000
Judgment for the plaintiff
in the amount of $3,100.

19:41.066 --> 19:42.767
Go have a discussion with your father.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.266
He's gonna give you a lesson or two.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.333
-[Ashley] Thank you.
-[Judy] Thank you.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.467
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.467
Okay. If she would have let me speak,
she would have understood

19:50.533 --> 19:52.066
that everything was authorized.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.667
I'm just super excited.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.934
He was lying and saying
everything was authorized.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.500
Like I told her that I was gonna purchase
something off of her card.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.400
They tried to lie about some of the stuff
that went on in the court case today.

20:02.467 --> 20:03.934
She wasn't in the town at the time,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.900
but if you feel me,
the donuts was good.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.667
He did admit to using my car.

20:07.734 --> 20:11.800
It was a female versus a male
at the end of the day.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.400
I just hope they both learn
responsibility and honesty.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.767
I was actually pretty impressed
with that young woman.

20:17.834 --> 20:20.200
I thought she was pretty smart

20:20.266 --> 20:22.800
with the exception of her taste in men.

20:22.867 --> 20:23.834
[both chuckle]

20:23.900 --> 20:25.667
You know, what looked good on the outside

20:25.734 --> 20:27.900
had a lot of growing up to do
on the inside,

20:27.967 --> 20:31.800
but I think life and events

20:31.867 --> 20:33.900
paid him back for doing the wrong thing.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.734
Hopefully he turns it around
and can only go up from here.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.200
[chuckles] Yeah, I think his father
was a little surprised.

20:40.266 --> 20:42.333
Didn't you think his father
was a little surprised?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.533
-Yeah.
-[Judy] At some of his answers?

20:43.600 --> 20:44.567
I thought he was.

20:44.633 --> 20:49.133
Anyway, as it progressed,
he didn't seem like a bad kid, just...

20:49.200 --> 20:51.066
-Had a lot of growing up to do.
-[Judy] Had a lot...

20:51.133 --> 20:52.000
Absolutely right.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.700
Had a lot of growing up to do.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.033
