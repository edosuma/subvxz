WEBVTT

00:06.907 --> 00:09.243
Hey, Charlie.
Teddy here

00:09.277 --> 00:11.245
on the couch
where I almost got

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
my first kiss
with Spencer.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.184
But she didn't.

00:16.217 --> 00:19.487
No no, because

00:19.520 --> 00:22.190
I made the mistake
of bringing the cute boy home

00:22.223 --> 00:24.825
where my
dear family lives.

00:24.858 --> 00:29.297
He wasn't that cute.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.599
Get out.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.337
Anyway, still waiting
on that first kiss.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.339
But there's a dance
this Friday

00:38.372 --> 00:40.208
where the girls
ask the guys,

00:40.241 --> 00:42.243
and this time I'm going
to make sure I get it.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.146
Get what, honey?

00:46.314 --> 00:49.350
Oh, my first A+
in science, Daddy.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.287
That's my girl.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.292
HEY, DAD, GREAT NEWS.
I GOT A JOB.

00:58.326 --> 01:02.196
STOP RIGHT THERE.
I'M HAVING THE GREATEST
DREAM OF MY LIFE.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.633
THE SCHOOL'S GONNA
PAY ME 100 BUCKS TO D.J.
AT THE DANCE ON FRIDAY.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.236
THE DREAM CONTINUES.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.238
I JUST NEED YOU
TO GIVE ME $200

01:10.271 --> 01:11.605
TO RENT
THE D.J. EQUIPMENT.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.275
AND NOW I'M AWAKE.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.578
HEY, WHAT WAS I DOING
IN THE DREAM?

01:17.611 --> 01:21.149
YOU WEREN'T SAYING ANYTHING,
WHICH IS WHY I THOUGHT
IT WAS A DREAM.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.454
P.J., WHY WOULD YOU
TAKE A JOB WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA LOSE MONEY?

01:26.487 --> 01:29.657
DOES EVERYTHING ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE ABOUT MONEY?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.261
ARE YOU GIVING ME
THE 200?

01:33.294 --> 01:37.265
SORRY, SON.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP
WITH THE MONEY SOME OTHER WAY.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.500
LIKE HOW?

01:39.533 --> 01:43.137
OH, I KNOW.
GET A JOB.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.608
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.144
- WAIT, WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?
- DON'T BOTHER HER, EMMETT.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.412
OKAY, WHERE SHOULDN'T I
BOTHER HER?

01:51.445 --> 01:54.182
- IN THE KITCHEN.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.518
HEY, TEDDY BEAR.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.154
HEY, EMMETT.

02:00.188 --> 02:03.291
YOU KNOW THIS DANCE
THIS FRIDAY NIGHT IS
"GIRLS ASK GUYS," RIGHT?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.326
UH-HUH.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.362
YOU'RE A GIRL.
I'M A GUY.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.266
SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO ASK ME?

02:12.300 --> 02:15.369
OKAY, EMMETT, LISTEN,

02:15.403 --> 02:18.306
P.J. IS MY BROTHER
AND YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.941
SO IN A WAY YOU'RE KIND OF
LIKE MY BROTHER TOO.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.577
AND I CAN'T GO TO THE DANCE
WITH MY BROTHER.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.714
YOU CAN SEE WHY THAT
WOULD BE WRONG, RIGHT?

02:26.747 --> 02:30.718
THIS IS THE LONGEST
CONVERSATION WE'VE EVER HAD.

02:30.751 --> 02:34.388
DID YOU HEAR
ANYTHING I JUST SAID?

02:34.422 --> 02:38.359
SOMETHING ABOUT WANTING
TO GO TO THE DANCE
WITH A BROTHER.

02:38.392 --> 02:42.330
EMMETT, I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.266
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU
TO THE DANCE.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.535
WHEN YOU TOUCH ME
IT FEELS LIKE ELECTRICITY.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.505
( rock music playing )

02:51.539 --> 02:53.307
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

02:53.341 --> 02:54.642
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

02:54.675 --> 02:57.445
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

02:57.478 --> 02:59.480
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

02:59.513 --> 03:01.449
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

03:01.482 --> 03:03.984
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

03:04.017 --> 03:07.488
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

03:07.521 --> 03:10.558
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

03:10.591 --> 03:12.693
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

03:12.726 --> 03:14.462
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

03:14.495 --> 03:17.398
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

03:17.431 --> 03:19.500
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

03:19.533 --> 03:21.001
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

03:21.034 --> 03:23.737
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

03:23.771 --> 03:26.440
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

03:26.474 --> 03:29.610
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

03:29.643 --> 03:33.714
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

03:35.416 --> 03:37.751
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.495
- HI, KIDS.
- HEY, MOM.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.497
COME ON, CHARLIE,
LET'S GO SEE DADDY.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.265
YOU KNOW WHAT
I REALIZED TODAY?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.633
CHARLIE'S NEVER PLAYED
LASER TAG.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.802
I BET SHE'D ENJOY DOING THAT
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.272
OH, HOW VERY SWEET
AND UNSELFISH OF YOU.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.740
BUT CHARLIE'S GONNA BE
WITH US FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.375
IT'S YOUR SCHOOL'S
OPEN HOUSE.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.644
RIGHT.
FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.547
WELL, WE HAVEN'T.
DAD AND I CAN'T WAIT

04:06.580 --> 04:08.782
TO MEET THIS MIRACLE WORKER--
MRS. MELLISH.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.651
SHE'S THE FIRST TEACHER WHO
ABOUT YOU.LED TO COMPLAIN

04:10.684 --> 04:14.555
ARE YOU SURE HE'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO SCHOOL?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.057
MOM, YOU'VE BEEN
TO SO MANY OPEN HOUSES.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.826
AND YOU'D LOVE
LASER TAG.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.429
IT'S LIKE A WORKOUT
BUT YOU GET TO SHOOT STUFF.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
OH, COME ON, WE CAN PLAY
LASER TAG ANYTIME.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.699
MEETING A TEACHER THAT HAS
NO PROBLEMS WITH YOU--

04:25.733 --> 04:28.436
THAT MAY NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.740
- THIS IS BAD.
- WHAT'S BAD?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.443
THE ONLY REASON I HAVEN'T
BEEN GETTING IN TROUBLE

04:35.476 --> 04:37.678
IS THAT I TOLD MY TEACHER
FIGHTING A LOT.E BEEN

04:37.711 --> 04:39.313
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?

04:39.347 --> 04:41.715
YOU ALSO HAVE TO GIVE
THE TEACHER ONE OF THESE.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.454
WOW, THAT'S GOOD.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.723
I ALMOST HUGGED YOU.
AND I NEVER WANT TO HUG YOU.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.725
WORKS EVEN BETTER
ON MRS. MELLISH.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.727
ANY TIME I DO
SOMETHING WRONG--

04:53.761 --> 04:57.731
MOMMY AND DADDY
WERE FIGHTING AGAIN.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.733
WOW.

04:59.767 --> 05:03.371
WELL, I GUESS YOUR EVIL PLAN
IS GONNA BE OVER
ON FRIDAY NIGHT,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.673
'CAUSE MOM AND DAD
WON'T BE FIGHTING.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.443
OR WILL THEY?

05:14.782 --> 05:18.486
SO WHO ARE YOU ASKING
TO THE DANCE?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
OKAY, HERE'S A HINT.
HE'S REALLY CUTE AND--

05:20.854 --> 05:22.890
YOU LADIES TALKING
ABOUT ME AGAIN?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.859
YOU KNOW I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOU,

05:25.893 --> 05:28.829
SINCE I DUMPED
YOUR SORRY BUTT
A LONG TIME AGO.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.899
THAT'S NOW HOW ME AND
MY SORRY BUTT REMEMBER IT.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.705
REMIND ME AGAIN WHY
YOU EVER WENT OUT WITH HIM.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.707
ONLY ONE WAY
TO EXPLAIN IT--

05:39.740 --> 05:41.409
BRAIN FART.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.477
BRAIN FART.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.447
SO WHO'S THIS CUTIE
YOU'RE GONNA ASK?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.782
SPENCER.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.784
OH, RIGHT,

05:50.818 --> 05:53.754
MR. ALMOST FIRST KISS.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.790
YOU'D BETTER
GET MOVING ON THAT.
YOUR WINDOW IS CLOSING.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.760
- WHAT WINDOW?
- THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.829
OH, THANKS.
THAT REALLY CLEARS THINGS UP.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.598
T, YOU ALMOST KISSED
THIS GUY,

06:04.632 --> 06:06.767
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
SINCE THEN.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.903
IF YOU DON'T ACT SOON,
YOU'RE DOOMED TO BE
JUST FRIENDS.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
I LIKE SPENCER,
HE LIKES ME,

06:11.939 --> 06:13.741
AND I'LL ASK HIM
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.543
THAT BETTER BE
RIGHT NOW, CHICA,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.411
BECAUSE LAUREN SANDOVAL
IS GONNA ASK HIM.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.514
LAUREN WOULD
NEVER DO THAT TO ME.
SHE'S TOO GOOD A FRIEND.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.616
- THERE'S YOUR GOOD FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.
- WHERE?

06:22.650 --> 06:25.519
- WALKING UP TO SPENCER.
- WHAT? THAT LITTLE WITCH!

06:30.858 --> 06:32.660
YEAH!

06:33.961 --> 06:37.831
OH, LAUREN,
YOU POOR THING.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.968
WHAT A HORRIBLE, UGLY
TOMATOEY MESS YOU ARE.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.706
COME ON, PIZZA FACE,
LET'S GET YOU CLEANED UP.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.576
COME ON.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.714
OH, SPENCER, HEY.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.948
HI, TEDDY.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.951
BOY, THAT PIZZA REALLY
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, HUH?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.853
YEAH.
NICE SHOT.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.756
IT'S ALL IN THE WRIST.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.597
NOW TELL ME AGAIN

07:09.630 --> 07:11.732
AND DON'T LEAVE OUT
A SINGLE DETAIL--

07:11.765 --> 07:13.734
WHAT EXACTLY DID SPENCER SAY
WHEN YOU ASKED HIM?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.736
HE SAID,
AND I QUOTE,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.004
"OKAY."

07:17.037 --> 07:20.708
( both scream )

07:21.942 --> 07:23.911
OH, WOULDN'T IT BE
SO ROMANTIC

07:23.944 --> 07:26.614
IF I GOT MY FIRST KISS
DURING A SLOW DANCE?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.949
THAT COULD HAPPEN
IF YOU DON'T WEAR

07:28.982 --> 07:31.752
THAT RED POLKADOT THING
THAT MAKES YOU LOOK
LIKE A CLOWN.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.622
NO NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.757
I SHOULD DRESS MORE SUBTLE
AND UNDERSTATED

07:36.790 --> 07:39.493
LIKE YOU.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.762
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.665
NOW I JUST HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT

07:44.698 --> 07:46.700
HOW SPENCER AND I ARE
GONNA GET TO THE DANCE.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.968
HOW ARE YOU
GETTING THERE?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.970
I HAVEN'T ASKED
ANYONE YET.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.774
I'M STILL TRYING TO DECIDE
BETWEEN FIVE GUYS.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.876
WELL, DO ANY OF THEM
DRIVE?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.878
LET'S SEE...

07:57.911 --> 08:00.548
SOPHOMORE, FRESHMAN,
SOPHOMORE,

08:00.581 --> 08:04.785
EIGHTH-GRADER I DON'T
REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.520
AND SOPHOMORE.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.556
SO NO, NO DRIVERS
ON THE LIST.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.058
THAT'S TOO BAD,
BECAUSE IF YOU COULD FIND
SOMEBODY WHO DRIVES

08:11.091 --> 08:12.960
THEN SPENCER AND I
COULD DOUBLE WITH YOU.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.996
YEAH, CONSIDER IT DONE.
I'LL JUST EXPAND MY LIST

08:16.029 --> 08:18.298
AND LOWER MY STANDARDS
A LITTLE BIT.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.968
LOWER THAN
THE EIGHTH GRADE?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.571
YOU WANT A RIDE
OR NOT?

08:24.972 --> 08:28.742
OKAY, THEY SAY IT'S GONNA
BE CHILLY TONIGHT.

08:28.776 --> 08:33.013
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NICE AND TOASTY.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.316
DID I REMEMBER
TO CHANGE YOUR DIAPER?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.619
I'M GONNA GO
WITH YES.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.055
- ARE YOU READY TO GO?
- YEAH.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.692
IT IS GONNA BE SO NICE
TO GO TO AN OPEN HOUSE

08:44.725 --> 08:46.694
AND NOT TO HAVE TO
HEAR THE WORDS

08:46.727 --> 08:50.931
"OH, YOU'RE
GABE'S PARENTS."

08:50.964 --> 08:53.901
MOM, ARE YOU
WEARING PERFUME?

08:53.934 --> 08:55.102
I AM.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.737
OH.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.971
WHAT?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

08:58.005 --> 09:01.341
OH, I LIKE IT, BUT...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.777
BUT WHAT?
DOES SOMEONE ELSE
NOT LIKE IT?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.846
I DON'T WANT TO GET
DAD IN TROUBLE.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.083
WAIT, DAD SAYS HE DOESN'T
LIKE MY PERFUME?

09:10.117 --> 09:12.953
HE DOESN'T JUST SAY IT.
HE MAKES A FACE TOO.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.122
AND SOMETIMES
THERE'S GAGGING.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.727
OH.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.729
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING.

09:21.762 --> 09:25.032
HAS YOUR FATHER SHARED
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU

09:25.065 --> 09:28.869
ABOUT HOW I
DISGUST HIM?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.706
I'VE SAID
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.008
OH, OKAY.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.978
OKAY.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.380
NICE JACKET, DAD.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.651
ISN'T IT?
GOT MY COMPANY LOGO
RIGHT THERE--

09:43.684 --> 09:46.153
FREE ADVERTISING AND
A GREAT CONVERSATION STARTER.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.124
DOES MOM KNOW
YOU'RE WEARING IT?

09:51.158 --> 09:54.628
OH, I'VE BEEN DRESSING
MYSELF FOR SOME TIME NOW.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.031
SO NO, I DIDN'T
RUN IT BY HER.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.168
OH, I GUESS SHE'LL JUST
HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.640
WHY?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

10:06.674 --> 10:11.078
I DON'T WANT
TO GET MOM IN TROUBLE,

10:11.111 --> 10:13.080
BUT JUST BETWEEN US,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.048
SHE THINKS YOU TALK
TOO MUCH ABOUT YOUR JOB.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.920
I TALK TOO MUCH
ABOUT MY JOB--

10:19.953 --> 10:22.656
THE SAME JOB
THAT PUTS A ROOF
OVER YOUR MOTHER'S HEAD?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.057
HEY, I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

10:24.091 --> 10:29.930
SO WHAT ELSE DOES SHE SAY
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.800
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH
ALREADY.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.068
COME ON, GUYS.
GOTTA GO.
GONNA BE LATE.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.137
WELL, WE'RE TAKING
THE BUG TRUCK,

10:37.170 --> 10:38.806
IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH YOU.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.041
AS LONG AS
THE WINDOWS WORK.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.244
I DON'T WANT TO TRIGGER
ANYONE'S GAG REFLEX.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.916
WOMEN.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.119
( doorbell rings )

10:52.152 --> 10:54.087
HEY, GOOD LUCK AT YOUR
OPEN HOUSE TONIGHT.

10:54.121 --> 10:58.826
GOOD LUCK AT WHATEVER
YOU'RE DRESSED SO WEIRD FOR.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.800
LOOK AT YOU.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.769
OH, NO, LOOK AT YOU.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.502
WELL, I WISH I WAS
SOMEONE ELSE

11:09.536 --> 11:11.872
SO I COULD LOOK
AT BOTH OF US.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.142
SO WHERE'S YOUR DATE?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.077
PARKING THE CAR.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.713
OH, I LIKE IT.
WHO IS HE?

11:19.747 --> 11:22.049
OKAY, ABOUT THAT--
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW--

11:22.082 --> 11:25.986
'SUP?

11:35.963 --> 11:38.065
EMMETT, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE REAL QUICK?

11:38.098 --> 11:40.100
OKAY, JUST--

11:42.035 --> 11:44.071
EMMETT?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.073
WE NEEDED
TRANSPORTATION.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.109
IT WAS EITHER EMMETT
OR AN EIGHTH-GRADER

11:49.142 --> 11:52.145
WITH A SKATEBOARD.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.848
LET'S JUST GO
HAVE A GOOD TIME, OKAY?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.192
SHALL WE?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.796
TEDDY BEAR.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.201
GRIZZLY BEAR.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.076
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.245
YOU ARE REALLY NICE.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.881
THANKS.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
WHOSE CAR IS THIS?

12:31.284 --> 12:34.788
MY GRANDPA'S.
HE THINKS I'M AT THE STORE
GETTING BREAD.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.057
BUT INSTEAD

12:37.090 --> 12:39.092
YOU'LL BE AT THE DANCE
GETTING NOTHING.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.798
WOW, LOOKS LIKE
MY SEAT BELT'S BROKEN.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.299
MAYBE I SHOULD SIT
IN THE MIDDLE.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.135
IS THAT OKAY?

12:48.168 --> 12:49.169
YEAH.

12:49.202 --> 12:53.273
'CAUSE I'M
ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.809
TEDDY, YOU'RE
BLOCKING MY VIEW.

12:55.843 --> 12:59.346
YOU MIND MOVING AWAY
FROM SPENCER?

12:59.379 --> 13:02.249
BIG GUY,
LEAN THE OTHER WAY.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.919
MORE.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.856
MORE.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.091
EMMETT, IF HE LEANS ANY MORE,
HE'LL FALL OUT OF THE CAR.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.126
MORE.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.972
WELL, THIS IS
MY CLASSROOM.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.108
MRS. MELLISH LOOKS BUSY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME BACK
NEXT YEAR.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.144
WHOA, P-U ALERT.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.915
I GET IT, OKAY?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.851
I'M TALKING ABOUT
CHARLIE'S DIAPER.
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.386
HECK IF I KNOW.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.254
AND FOR YOUR
INFORMATION,

13:41.288 --> 13:45.358
SOME PEOPLE FIND THAT SCENT
VERY PLEASANT.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.395
A FULL DIAPER?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.397
I'M GONNA BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.233
- I'M GONNA GO
CHANGE CHARLIE, OKAY?
- OKAY.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.169
- HI, GABE.
- HI, MRS. MELLISH.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.238
HOW IS MY BRAVE
LITTLE SOLDIER?

13:58.271 --> 14:02.142
NOT GOOD.
MOM AND DAD ARE
FIGHTING AGAIN.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.410
OH, YOU POOR THING.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.879
THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING
ALL WEEK.

14:05.913 --> 14:10.217
I DON'T THINK I CAN GET
THAT BOOK REPORT INTO YOU
BY TUESDAY.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.020
THAT'S OKAY, DEAR.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.122
YOU TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.124
I DON'T NEED TIME.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.226
I NEED HAPPINESS.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.962
OH.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.234
( dance music playing )

14:41.348 --> 14:44.117
ALL RIGHT.
THAT SONG WAS
BROUGHT TO YOU

14:44.151 --> 14:46.119
BY FREDDY'S
STEREO HUT.

14:46.153 --> 14:49.056
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO ROCK STEADY,
GO SEE FREDDY.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.059
P.J., WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE COMMERCIALS?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.393
THAT'S HOW I'M PAYING
FOR ALL THE EQUIPMENT.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.128
I GOT SOME SPONSORS
TO BUY ADVERTISING.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.097
WHO WOULD BUY
ADVERTISING FROM YOU?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.099
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.401
THIS NEXT ONE IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY MOM

15:01.434 --> 15:03.403
WHO GAVE ME
20 BUCKS.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.405
MOM-- WHEN YOU
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY

15:05.438 --> 15:08.008
CAN'T GET ANY MORE MONEY
OUT OF DAD.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.448
BOB, COME HERE,
HONEY, LOOK.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.219
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
GABE DREW.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.222
ISN'T THAT
SWEET?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.357
YEAH, IT SURE IS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.226
I GUESS WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.461
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

15:28.495 --> 15:31.331
GABE, IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR
PARENTS ARE GETTING ALONG.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.133
I'M GONNA GO
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.502
GOTTA THINK.
GOTTA THINK.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.144
IT'S GO TIME, RICKY.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.515
EXCUSE ME, LADY.
YOU'VE GOT A RAT
ON YOUR SHOULDER.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.217
( screaming )

15:50.250 --> 15:52.119
RAT ON THE LOOSE!

15:52.152 --> 15:54.354
REMAIN CALM.
REMAIN CALM.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.523
REMAIN CALM.
REMAIN CALM.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.362
SPENCER, COULD YOU GET
ME SOME PUNCH, PLEASE?

16:02.395 --> 16:05.232
SURE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.168
EMMETT, WHY DON'T YOU
GO GET ME SOME PUNCH TOO?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.137
WHAT, YOUR FEET
DON'T WORK?

16:11.204 --> 16:14.441
- ICE OR NO ICE?
- SURPRISE ME.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.443
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO MAKE MY MOVE.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.245
GO GET THAT KISS,
GIRL.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.781
HEY, P.J., PUT ON
A SLOW SONG, OKAY?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.316
YOU GOT IT, SIS.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.320
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
BRING IT DOWN NOW,

16:27.354 --> 16:31.258
JUST LIKE YOU SHOULD
BRING YOURSELVES DOWN
TO WALLY'S WAFFLES.

16:31.291 --> 16:35.028
TELL THEM P.J. SENT YOU.
YOU CAN GET A FREE
PAT OF BUTTER.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.497
( slow song playing )

16:37.530 --> 16:40.767
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH, THANKS.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.335
LET'S DANCE.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.447
YO, QUICK, THROW ON
SOME HIP-HOP.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.585
- BUT I JUST STARTED
THIS SONG.
- NOW.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.588
- ( song stops )
- OKAY, THIS NEXT ONE IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY EMMETT.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.590
EMMETT-- HE'S...

17:03.623 --> 17:06.793
STANDING RIGHT THERE.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.362
( hip-hop song
playing )

18:48.495 --> 18:51.198
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.466
EMMETT
STOLE MY DATE.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.305
BACK WE GO,
LITTLE GUY,

18:58.338 --> 19:01.441
SAFE AND SOUND.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.477
BOY, REALLY TIRED.
WE SHOULD GO.

19:04.511 --> 19:08.415
THANK YOU, MR. DUNCAN.
THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.550
WELL, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE PEST CONTROL BIZ

19:10.583 --> 19:12.552
AS LONG
AS I HAVE, YOU--

19:12.585 --> 19:16.423
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
TALK ABOUT MY WORK.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.491
IT BUGS MY WIFE.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.660
NO, IT DOESN'T.
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.495
BECAUSE GABE TOLD ME
IT DID.

19:22.529 --> 19:26.566
CHARLIE LOOKS MORE
TIRED THAN ME, SO...

19:26.599 --> 19:28.501
GABE TOLD ME
YOU HATED MY PERFUME.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.303
I NEVER SAID THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.205
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DO THIS HERE.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.374
ISN'T IT BAD ENOUGH
THAT POOR GABE HAS TO LISTEN

19:34.407 --> 19:36.509
TO YOU TWO CONSTANTLY
FIGHTING AT HOME?

19:36.543 --> 19:39.946
WE DON'T FIGHT AT HOME.
WE'RE VERY HAPPY.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.948
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
GABE DREW OF OUR FAMILY.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.650
THAT'S NOT HIS.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.485
THAT'S GABE M'S.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.687
THIS IS GABE D'S.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.460
THAT'S DISTURBING.

19:53.493 --> 19:57.630
MRS. MELLISH, I ASSURE YOU
WE'RE A VERY LOVING FAMILY.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.666
GABE, GET YOUR BUTT
OVER HERE.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.537
NOW WHY WOULD YOU
TELL YOUR TEACHER THAT
WE'RE FIGHTING AT HOME?

20:04.571 --> 20:08.541
SO I COULD GET OUT
OF DOING MY WORK.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.443
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE,
RIGHT?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.445
Together:
OH, YEAH.

20:12.479 --> 20:16.549
HAVE ALL YOUR OVERDUE
ASSIGNMENTS ON MY DESK
MONDAY MORNING.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.518
BUT THAT'LL TAKE ME
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.788
YOU POOR THING.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.759
GET YOUR COAT.
WE'RE LEAVING.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.429
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LET HIM
PLAY US LIKE THAT.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.299
I KNOW.
HOW COULD I EVER THINK
YOU DIDN'T LIKE MY PERFUME?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.667
WELL, IT'S NOT
MY FAVORITE.

20:34.701 --> 20:39.572
SAID THE GUY WITH
THE CARTOON COCKROACH
ON HIS BLAZER.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.312
IT'S AN ANT.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.680
MAN, YOUR JERKING
IS DOPE.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.350
MAN, YOUR POPPING--
SICK.

20:50.383 --> 20:54.521
I'D LIKE TO POP
BOTH OF THESE JERKS.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.589
SORRY YOU DIDN'T
GET THAT KISS.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.392
YEAH, WELL, THE NIGHT'S
NOT OVER YET.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.394
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.730
HEY, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.398
WHAT NOISE?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.800
THE NOISE TEDDY
IS TALKING ABOUT.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.403
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMING
FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.440
YEAH, I HEAR IT TOO.
IT SOUNDS BAD.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.075
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
PULL OVER AND CHECK IT OUT.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.844
- I'M TELLING YOU--
- STOP THE CAR!

21:17.877 --> 21:20.580
( tires screech )

21:20.613 --> 21:23.616
JUST COME ON,
I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE
THE NOISE IS COMING FROM.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.718
I KNOW WHERE THE NOISE
IS COMING FROM.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.720
YOU WANT TO KEEP
THAT HEAD?

21:27.754 --> 21:30.623
I SUGGEST
YOU NOT DO THAT AGAIN.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.703
OH, SORRY, SORRY.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.872
( horn honks )

21:45.905 --> 21:49.609
IN MY HEAD THAT WENT
A LOT SMOOTHER.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.713
HELLO THERE.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.582
HI.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.850
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I GOT SO CAUGHT UP

21:57.884 --> 21:59.852
WITH EMMETT
AND THE DANCING.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.389
I KIND OF LIKE THE WAY
THINGS WERE GOING
BEFORE THEN.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.391
YEAH, ME TOO.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.459
I'M GLAD WE GOT TO GO
TO THE DANCE TOGETHER.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.529
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
BECAUSE IVY SAID MY
WINDOW WAS CLOSING.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.764
AND THEN LAUREN SANDOVAL
ALMOST ASKED YOU.
AND THEN IVY AND EMMETT

22:11.798 --> 22:13.900
SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO.
HOW IS THIS GONNA WORK?"

22:13.933 --> 22:15.668
AND I JUST--

22:19.739 --> 22:23.610
THAT WAS A REALLY NICE WAY
OF TELLING ME TO SHUT UP.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.821
Well, Charlie, I finally
got my first kiss tonight

22:34.854 --> 22:36.823
and now I can't
stop smiling.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.825
Who knew that
Emmett's grandpa's car

22:38.858 --> 22:42.929
would turn out to be
in the world?ntic place

22:42.962 --> 22:45.698
Okay, I'm gonna try
and stop smiling.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.541
No, I can't do it.
( squeals )

22:57.510 --> 22:59.712
( dance music playing )

23:03.750 --> 23:06.185
MAN, LOOK AT THAT GIRL
WORKING.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.620
WOW. I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOOD.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.689
NOT AS GOOD AS THAT.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.691
SHE'S GOT IT GOING ON.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.826
( music continues )
