WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.868
- [Mary] All right, Patty.
- [Phillip] Come on, Hap.

00:02.935 --> 00:04.403
Good girl, Happy.

00:08.108 --> 00:12.277
We thought we had an opportunity
to introduce Happy to Patty.

00:12.279 --> 00:16.882
For this situation to work, Happy
has to be totally comfortable with it.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.951
[Phillip] She's so suspicious
of everything.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.587
[trumpets]

00:23.056 --> 00:24.556
[Dr. Pare] Doesn't that look
like a turkey foot?

00:24.558 --> 00:25.557
[laughter]

00:26.626 --> 00:29.428
You guys are very cute.
Let's go make shoes.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.967
<i>[Ty] Beaver's in the hall. There
ya go. Now we're picking up steam.</i>

00:34.969 --> 00:37.736
<i>[Kathleen] Isabella, she has a
problem with her tooth regrowth.</i>

00:37.738 --> 00:39.905
They grow in a little crooked.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.874
<i>So we have to give her
a little tooth trim.</i>

00:41.876 --> 00:43.075
[Dr. Chaney] Good girl.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.811
[opening theme music playing]

00:45.813 --> 00:49.148
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.483
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:52.519 --> 00:55.654
We've got to take that image
and change it.

00:55.656 --> 00:59.425
They really enjoy this. It strengthens
the bond that we have with these guys.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.627
Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.829
[woman] Go on, ladies.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.865
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep animals
in exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:06.867 --> 01:09.001
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:09.003 --> 01:12.538
<i>And for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:12.540 --> 01:14.073
[man] Are you rolling?

01:14.140 --> 01:16.708
<i>[Jim] The general public would
never get the access you're gonna get.</i>

01:16.710 --> 01:18.143
[woman] What a good girl!

01:18.145 --> 01:22.114
<i>Which is to see what goes on
behind the scenes every day.</i>

01:22.116 --> 01:23.749
That's how we do it here in
the boogie down Bronx.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.284
[laughter]

01:46.239 --> 01:48.373
[Chuck] They get really
excited about the crickets.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.479
<i>Ocellated turkeys,
they are rare in the wild.</i>

01:53.481 --> 01:57.716
<i>They're only found in three countries,
Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</i>

01:57.718 --> 02:02.855
<i>A lot of it has to do with habitat
loss, development, and also a big one</i>

02:02.857 --> 02:04.590
<i>with ocellated turkeys
is hunting.</i>

02:04.592 --> 02:06.959
<i>They are also a rare one
in the zoos.</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:09.027
<i>They use to be a lot more
common then they are today.</i>

02:09.029 --> 02:12.998
<i>But really only a handful of zoos
currently work with this species.</i>

02:14.501 --> 02:17.402
That's why we made a
concentrated effort this year

02:17.404 --> 02:19.104
to hatch as many as we could.

02:23.343 --> 02:29.248
So, in this stall right here, we
have four ocellated turkeys poults.

02:29.983 --> 02:34.153
And a "poult" is a word
for a baby game bird.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.955
They're just over
three weeks old.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.092
Come on. Want some crickets?

02:40.493 --> 02:41.994
Here ya go.

02:44.697 --> 02:49.535
It's also really nice to see
natural foraging behaviors like this.

02:49.537 --> 02:55.040
You know, they would be eating a
lot of insects and other invertebrate life

02:55.042 --> 03:00.812
in the wild. So, it's nice to give them
opportunities to hunt these little insects

03:00.814 --> 03:04.416
as part of their
daily activities and diets.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.819
The first group of eggs
we had were from one female.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.688
Those were all these chicks.
And the ones currently incubating

03:09.690 --> 03:12.491
are from the second female.

03:12.493 --> 03:16.261
We're going to head to the incubation
room. It's just down the hall here.

03:17.897 --> 03:21.633
<i>The Bronx Zoo is a zoo I
grew up coming to as a little kid.</i>

03:21.635 --> 03:24.169
<i>When I look at photo albums
it's almost like I lived here.</i>

03:24.171 --> 03:25.604
<i>My parents took me here
all the time.</i>

03:25.606 --> 03:29.575
I actually attribute my love
of animals to that.

03:29.577 --> 03:33.412
<i>When I had this opportunity to return to
New York and especially the Bronx Zoo,</i>

03:33.414 --> 03:37.082
<i>I knew that it was an
opportunity I had to pursue.</i>

03:37.084 --> 03:40.519
Because if I didn't pursue it, I was
probably would never have forgiven myself.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.425
We do have more ocellated
turkey eggs incubating.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.760
So this was a clutch
of seven eggs.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.897
At the time that we pulled the eggs, we
candled them, we saw that two we infertile,

03:51.899 --> 03:55.000
and five were fertile,
healthy, and developing.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.173
What I see inside the egg is a
very healthy embryo that's large.

04:01.175 --> 04:05.310
This is definitely within a
week to ten days of hatching.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.214
The air cell is well-defined.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.985
Because ocellated turkeys are pretty
rare, every individual that we are able to

04:12.987 --> 04:15.087
hatch and raise
was very important.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.023
We're getting closer
and closer to a hatch.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.592
The embryo is definitely moving.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.462
That's really what we
like to see. There it goes.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.510
[Ty] There ya go.
Now we're picking up steam.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.114
Beaver's in the hall.

04:42.815 --> 04:44.049
[chuckles]

04:44.617 --> 04:45.617
Come on, Isabella.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.188
<i>[Ty] Isabella is a
North American beaver.</i>

04:51.658 --> 04:54.893
We've had her here at the
Bronx Zoo for eight years.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.330
And she was rescued from the
wild because she was orphaned.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.134
Beavers, they're such
interesting animals.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.070
<i>You know, they have
that really big, flattened tail.</i>

05:05.072 --> 05:05.937
<i>And they're very, very, cute.</i>

05:05.939 --> 05:08.440
I love Isabella.

05:08.442 --> 05:12.044
Um, I can't honestly say
that it is the other way around.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.946
<i>'Cause she just kind of,
you know, she's very stoic.</i>

05:17.183 --> 05:18.417
What'd you think, girly?

05:19.118 --> 05:20.452
She's giving me the side eyes.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.789
Isabella is definitely a diva.

05:23.791 --> 05:28.126
You know, she works at her own
speed. And we're perfectly fine with that.

05:30.596 --> 05:33.699
<i>[Kathleen] Beavers' teeth are
really neat. They constantly grow.</i>

05:33.701 --> 05:37.803
But in the wild they'll be chewing so
many different types of wood and bark.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.839
And it'll keep
their teeth trimmed.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.309
<i>Isabella has had teeth issues.
So they don't grow in straight.</i>

05:44.311 --> 05:46.845
<i>They'll go one way
or the other way.</i>

05:46.847 --> 05:51.483
<i>So what we have to do is monitor
her teeth to make sure they're okay.</i>

05:51.485 --> 05:53.752
<i>Recently one of her
teeth cracked.</i>

05:53.754 --> 05:57.489
<i>And we have to bring her to the
animal Health Center to get a tooth trim.</i>

06:03.496 --> 06:05.063
- [Kathleen] Hello.
- [Dr. Chaney] Hey.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.033
[penguins calling]

06:13.005 --> 06:14.906
- [Dr. Chaney] Isn't she ridiculous?
- [chuckling]

06:14.908 --> 06:17.075
[Kathleen] Ain't she cute
when she does that?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.978
[Kira] All right so this is
the size of the tooth that

06:19.980 --> 06:21.847
broke off, so it was
a decent piece.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.249
[Kathleen] Hey, sweetheart.
You're okay.

06:26.619 --> 06:32.090
Dr. Chaney is here to give Isabella
an injection to make her nice and calm.

06:32.092 --> 06:36.728
<i>And Kira and I will bring her over to the
Health Center to give her a little tooth trim.</i>

06:36.730 --> 06:38.063
Good girl.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.965
- [Kira] All good?
- [Kathleen] All good.

06:40.767 --> 06:41.500
[Kathleen] Perfect.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.468
[Kira] All right, cool.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.111
[woman] There it is, you guys.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.113
[man] There's the elephant!
Look at it.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.451
-[Michelle] Asia one, I'm set.
-[man over walkie-talkie] <i>10-4.</i>

06:59.453 --> 07:03.021
We're about to give Patty
access into the exhibit,

07:03.023 --> 07:06.291
and I'll hold her over here for a little
bit and do some behaviors with her.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.094
Come here, Patty.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.029
Patty, foot.

07:12.498 --> 07:13.932
All right.

07:15.001 --> 07:17.068
It's really important for us to
get a good look at them every day

07:17.070 --> 07:18.670
and keep them healthy.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.705
When we're doing these
behaviors we're

07:20.707 --> 07:23.608
making sure there's nothing
stuck under their feet.

07:23.610 --> 07:27.012
Patty's very easy going.
She's pretty good

07:27.014 --> 07:30.182
as far as complying with
everything that we usually ask for.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.017
Back up.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.118
Jump Up. Open.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.486
Open. Good.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.155
I can look at her teeth now.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.691
I've always enjoyed animals.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.828
It's kind of funny 'cause I really
couldn't have a lot of pets at home.

07:42.830 --> 07:48.467
So for me, there was this drive to
come here, to see the animals all the time.

07:48.469 --> 07:52.871
And my first job, when I was in high
school, was working at the children's zoo.

07:52.873 --> 07:56.141
So I, kind of, always knew it
was something that I wanted to do.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.109
Trunk under.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.879
Good.

08:03.683 --> 08:09.788
We are going over right now to visit with
the elephants and see how they're doing.

08:09.790 --> 08:14.025
<i>Since the early 1900s,
we've had elephants here.</i>

08:14.027 --> 08:18.463
<i>Elephants originally were housed in
the building we now call Zoo Center,</i>

08:18.465 --> 08:20.866
<i>which was originally
the Elephant House.</i>

08:20.868 --> 08:24.870
<i>It was state of the art
when it was built in 1908.</i>

08:24.872 --> 08:27.038
<i>Right now we have
two Asian elephants,</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:30.175
<i>Patty and Happy. And they're
both about 50 years old.</i>

08:30.177 --> 08:32.143
Which is kind of old
for an elephant.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.445
Lean in.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.280
Good.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.050
Patty, back up. Good.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.021
[Jim] Hey, Michelle.

08:45.424 --> 08:48.593
<i>So this is Patty. This is one
of our two Asian elephants.</i>

08:48.595 --> 08:53.231
And I remember her when
she was a really young elephant.

08:53.233 --> 08:58.370
When she came here in the '70s,
she was probably about that tall.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.272
And how's she doing?

09:00.773 --> 09:05.210
I mean, Patty's by herself now, she doesn't
have Maxine so, she seems really quiet.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.847
<i>[Jim] Patty was living
with Maxine.</i>

09:08.849 --> 09:13.718
<i>Maxine developed a cancer which
was kind of systemic throughout her body.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:17.022
<i>Ended up in her brain and
caused all kinds of issues.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:20.859
<i>So, we had to euthanize Maxine.</i>

09:20.861 --> 09:25.163
We were concerned about how
Patty would adjust to life without her.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.431
[Phillip] Come on, Hap.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.033
Good girl.

09:29.569 --> 09:34.606
<i>[Jim] We thought we had an
opportunity to introduce Happy to Patty.</i>

09:34.608 --> 09:37.075
[Phillip] Where ya going?
Where ya going, Hap?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.478
We did so, and it didn't work
out as well as we planned.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.015
There was some aggression and a
lot of stress between the two animals.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.717
<i>Especially in Happy.</i>

09:45.719 --> 09:47.118
[Phillip] Wanna come back?

09:47.853 --> 09:53.992
Like people, not every elephant has
the same temperament, personality

09:53.994 --> 09:56.461
<i>or desire to get along
with other elephants.</i>

09:56.929 --> 10:00.065
Good girl. There ya go.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.468
<i>[Jim] So we would alternate
the elephants on exhibit.</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:05.370
Happy, trunk and foot.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.073
Good girl.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.609
Good girl, Hap.

10:10.611 --> 10:15.513
<i>[Jim] What we did this year was,
we modified the exhibit so both</i>

10:15.515 --> 10:19.684
<i>Patty and Happy could be
out on exhibit at the same time.</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:26.658
<i>The key was designing this barrier to
keep the elephants separated physically.</i>

10:26.660 --> 10:29.327
<i>They can interact with each
other, they can see each other,</i>

10:29.329 --> 10:34.366
smell each other. They just can't occupy
the same space and injure each other.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.367
Trunk under.

10:36.369 --> 10:40.071
<i>[Jim] Basically reflecting the
way they live inside, off exhibit.</i>

10:41.040 --> 10:42.140
Good girl.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.076
Trunk up.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.249
Open. Open. Good.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.786
As we're going through this process
and we're making these modifications,

10:54.788 --> 10:57.022
we do so with a real
sensitivity towards Happy

10:57.024 --> 11:00.992
<i>because we have to make sure that she's
comfortable with the changes that we're making</i>

11:00.994 --> 11:03.461
<i>and all the new things
that we're introducing her to.</i>

11:03.796 --> 11:05.397
[Phillip] Good girl, Hap.

11:07.767 --> 11:12.904
Our new ocellated turkey poult has
one foot curled. We are making the shoes

11:12.906 --> 11:15.306
<i>for the chick to help
correct his toes.</i>

11:15.308 --> 11:16.908
[Dr. Pare] Doesn't that look
like a turkey foot?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.243
[laughter]

11:19.011 --> 11:20.845
[Dr. Chaney] She's got
cool teeth.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.048
Beaver's, they need
big strong teeth.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.150
[Kathleen] You're so cute.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.051
I love you.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.019
I do. I really like her.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.328
[woman] There he is.
There the baby, see?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.867
Okay. We're ready?

11:42.869 --> 11:46.071
Sounds like there are two new
chicks that I haven't met yet?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.139
-Yes -[Dr. Drumm] In
addition to those three.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.407
Yes. All right, let's go.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.148
Come on in.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.685
All of our ocellated
turkey eggs have hatched.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.354
One last night and the last
one this morning.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.825
<i>Ocellated turkeys lay a lot of
eggs and not all of them are fertile.</i>

12:06.827 --> 12:08.793
<i>So you never know what you're gonna get.
But it was really exciting to have really</i>

12:08.795 --> 12:10.962
<i>good fertility this year.</i>

12:10.964 --> 12:14.632
[Casey] We go our little guy right
here before we open up. Look at his toes.

12:14.634 --> 12:18.269
- [Dr. Drumm] Oh yeah, he's curled under.
- [Casey] It's curled in there.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.840
You wanna take
a nice look at him?

12:21.842 --> 12:24.309
When the chick was hatched
we noticed a foot facing inward.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.046
[peeping]

12:29.548 --> 12:31.149
[Casey] I'll take that
if you want.

12:31.851 --> 12:36.488
Our new ocellated turkey poult was hatched
with what we call "tendon contracture."

12:36.490 --> 12:40.058
<i>Um, so his little toes are
curled in on themselves.</i>

12:40.060 --> 12:43.428
[Dr. Pare] Pretty much all toes.
So, we need to put shoes on them.

12:44.697 --> 12:49.667
<i>[Dr. Drumm] And so if you wait until he's
already grown and he has a little club foot,</i>

12:49.669 --> 12:54.272
then it's much harder to correct after his
bones and tendons have already grown.

12:54.306 --> 12:59.077
<i>So we're using his body's natural growth
phase to, kind of, help correct it himself.</i>

13:03.649 --> 13:06.518
<i>[Dr. Pare] And why don't you take
one of those little birds out, please.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:07.986
He wants to take one
of the good ones out.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.321
- [Dr. Pare] Yep.
- [Kevin] He wants to trace the toes.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.857
He's gonna do a little
Michelangelo work here.

13:12.859 --> 13:18.463
Our turkey poult has one foot curled so
what we need to do is straighten them out.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.867
<i>We are making the shoes for
the chick to help correct his toes.</i>

13:22.869 --> 13:29.841
He has the healthy sibling so we'll be able
to us them as a model to trace a normal foot.

13:29.843 --> 13:30.942
[Dr. Pare] Doesn't that look
like a turkey foot?

13:30.944 --> 13:32.009
[laughter]

13:32.044 --> 13:34.579
- [Dr. Pare] Which one is better?
- I don't...

13:34.581 --> 13:37.382
- Here, you try one.
- [Dr. Drumm] Oh, gosh.

13:37.384 --> 13:41.286
-Maybe your art skills are better
than JP's -[Dr. Drumm] Oh, well, I...

13:41.288 --> 13:45.290
Hey, little one. I'm going to
take this paper tracing back to the

13:45.292 --> 13:47.158
Health Center and I will
use it as a stencil

13:47.160 --> 13:49.961
<i>to trace onto the cardboard
to make the shoe.</i>

13:50.196 --> 13:51.429
[Dr. Pare] You guys
are very cute.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.964
[Dr. Drumm] How's that look?

13:52.966 --> 13:55.266
- [Casey] Oh, that looks way better.
- [Dr. Drumm] Oh, look at that.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.403
[Dr. Pare] Let's go
make shoes.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.371
<i>These things are so cute.</i>

14:10.816 --> 14:14.018
- [child] Not in the water.
- [woman] No, he's not in the water.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.324
[Kathleen] All right,
all the way up.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.059
<i>Right now we're
at the Health Center.</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:25.230
We're gonna give Isabella a tooth trim to
make them even since one of them chipped off.

14:27.499 --> 14:28.933
[Kathleen] Okay, Mama.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.104
<i>Their teeth are so important.</i>

14:33.106 --> 14:36.641
In the wild they build really
intricate dams that help control

14:36.643 --> 14:38.076
the flow of water downstream.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.678
<i>And they need big strong teeth
to cut down these trees.</i>

14:40.680 --> 14:43.781
<i>So beavers are so
ecologically important in the wild.</i>

14:43.783 --> 14:48.486
You want to hold from here? I'll move
her hand up. She's got such cool teeth.

14:50.856 --> 14:55.226
[Dr. Chaney] All righty. So, we'll trim
this one down and these across here.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.295
- Are you good, Jesse?
- Mm-hmm.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.830
[Dr. Chaney] Okay.

14:58.832 --> 14:59.764
All right.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.499
[drill whirring]

15:01.501 --> 15:07.705
We're using a little saw that will cut
the teeth but doesn't cause her any pain.

15:07.707 --> 15:13.111
Clearly, if she were awake she wouldn't tolerate
this. So we put her under, uh, anesthesia

15:13.113 --> 15:15.446
<i>for this so we can do it
safely around her mouth.</i>

15:20.853 --> 15:21.853
[Kathleen] Nice, you got both.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.888
[Dr. Chaney] You like that?

15:23.890 --> 15:26.991
- [Kathleen] That's good.
- [Dr. Chaney] Yeah, they look nice and straight.

15:26.993 --> 15:31.162
And then if you guys want to grab
her crate, we can recover her in there.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.964
[Kathleen] You're so cute!

15:34.066 --> 15:35.233
I love you.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.368
I do. I really like her.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.373
You good?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.813
[Dr. Chaney] Do you remember
her when she first came in?

15:48.815 --> 15:52.784
[Kathleen] You would walk by her
pool area and she would just splash water

15:52.786 --> 15:56.187
and make the angry
beaver noises. It was cute.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.389
-[Dr. Chaney] Hi!
-[Kathleen] Hi, honey. It's okay.

15:59.892 --> 16:03.394
[Dr. Chaney] Okay, she like, "I
don't want to be here anymore, guys."

16:04.863 --> 16:06.030
[Kathleen] Doing her
beaver pose.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.432
Thank you.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.067
<i>Isabella's tooth trim
went smoothly.</i>

16:09.069 --> 16:11.936
We're gonna bring her back
to tab now and we'll monitor her

16:11.938 --> 16:14.205
<i>over the next few hours,
couple of days,</i>

16:14.207 --> 16:16.207
<i>to see if she's eating
and back to normal.</i>

16:18.877 --> 16:19.510
Oh, no.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.112
Let's do this.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.048
[Dr. Drumm] What interesting
things humans do.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.450
[Dr. Pare] That's beautiful.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.618
[Gabby] You ready
to go swimming?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.989
<i>Our little penguin
chicks are five months old.</i>

16:30.991 --> 16:36.694
And it's just all these moving pieces to
help raise them into adult little penguins.

16:36.696 --> 16:40.031
Right on target. I know
you can't tell but I'm smiling.

16:47.139 --> 16:50.141
-[woman] Wave. Say, "Hi, tiger."
-[baby babbling]

16:51.110 --> 16:53.244
[man] Oh, wow! Tiger!

16:55.114 --> 16:56.381
[Michelle] Good morning, Happy.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.150
Good morning, Patty.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.820
<i>We're been putting Happy
and Patty out on exhibit now</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:04.989
<i>next to each other, for
about two weeks.</i>

17:04.991 --> 17:08.826
There is a physical barrier between
them but they do have visual contact.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.462
Then I will put Patty out
first and move her through.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.903
Michelle, she's on her way.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.104
[Michelle over walkie talkie]
<i>10-4.</i>

17:23.509 --> 17:25.977
[Michelle] Come here.

17:25.979 --> 17:29.080
Patty's right here following us up.
She already knows the routine now.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.784
Come here.

17:32.786 --> 17:37.422
The first time we tried Patty and Happy on
exhibit together after we modified the exhibit.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.690
[man] Hey, Patty.
Good girl.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.494
<i>[Jim] Patty, she's a very competent
animal so she adjusted very readily.</i>

17:43.796 --> 17:45.963
[man] if you guys are
ready, you can let Happy out.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.367
Here she comes.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.969
She's taking time
to think about it.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.940
Now Happy, on the other hand, is
an animal who's a little more wary

17:55.942 --> 17:58.409
and not terribly
comfortable with change.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.012
[man] She's making her way up.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.814
- [Jim] Here we go, kids.
- [man] Yeah.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.115
Does she see her?

18:04.117 --> 18:06.150
[man] I can't imagine
she doesn't.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.153
[Jim] She sees her.

18:14.393 --> 18:17.628
<i>[Jim] When she noticed
Patty in that upper area,</i>

18:17.630 --> 18:21.899
<i>she got concerned and she, kind of,
hightailed it out of that exhibit quickly.</i>

18:21.901 --> 18:25.002
<i>Because she did not want to
be in the same space as Patty.</i>

18:25.037 --> 18:26.938
That was something.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.940
Do you think that was
the first time she saw her?

18:28.942 --> 18:29.740
[Jim] I do.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.076
[man] She took a step at least.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.146
I have a feeling we
may be done for today though.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.281
[Michelle] All right, Patty.

18:38.016 --> 18:38.850
You're clear.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.319
Now we're gonna put Happy out.

18:41.386 --> 18:45.490
<i>[Jim] The one thing working with
animals teaches you is patience.</i>

18:47.059 --> 18:51.229
<i>Now, Happy has been making
progress with their living situation.</i>

18:51.530 --> 18:54.065
[Mary] She's on her way.

18:54.067 --> 18:57.368
<i>[Michelle] What's really important for us
is to make sure that both Happy and Patty</i>

18:57.370 --> 18:59.069
<i>are nice and calm.</i>

18:59.071 --> 19:02.707
So we have those times that they're out
in the exhibit together be short at first.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.309
And then we would extend those
period of time longer and longer.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.846
We're on our way
to see Happy now.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.817
When you're working through a
process like this, we want to reward

19:12.819 --> 19:16.020
Happy each time she's out there.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.856
<i>Make her comfortable
in the environment.</i>

19:18.858 --> 19:21.459
<i>So you take
step by step with it.</i>

19:22.094 --> 19:23.594
Hey, Hap.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.999
Wanna have a shower? Put
your trunk under. Good girl, Happy.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.135
All right, let's get wet.
Let's test the waters.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.140
Good girl, Happy.
Put your trunk under.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.942
Good girl.

19:38.911 --> 19:44.015
Right now as you can see we have her
in this exhibit. And above we have Patty.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.986
And they both appear
to be very comfortable.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.989
So far, so good.

19:51.991 --> 19:58.496
Elephant are smart. She's incredibly
sharp. Has a very strong memory.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.298
She very, very, engaging.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.935
Good girl, Hap. Steady.

20:03.937 --> 20:07.138
<i>[Jim] We're criticized a lot because
we have these two elephants that don't</i>

20:07.140 --> 20:08.739
<i>share the same physical space.</i>

20:08.741 --> 20:13.544
<i>And we get a lot of pressure to
move these elephants to a sanctuary.</i>

20:13.546 --> 20:19.750
It all comes down to the basic
personality of individual elephants.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.688
<i>Especially with Happy, she
came here in the early '70s,</i>

20:23.690 --> 20:27.024
<i>and she does not
adjust to change well.</i>

20:27.026 --> 20:29.293
[Phillip] Good girl, Hap. Steady.
Give me your trunk over here.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.098
Good girl.

20:35.834 --> 20:40.938
In order for this situation to work, Happy
has to be totally comfortable with it.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.609
We've been exhibiting Patty in the upper
exhibit and Happy in the lower exhibit

20:44.611 --> 20:48.112
that's divided by cables
and hotwire.

20:48.114 --> 20:52.717
<i>The hotwires serve as a
secondary barrier between the cables</i>

20:52.719 --> 20:56.554
<i>so they can't get into
trouble with one another.</i>

20:56.556 --> 20:59.890
<i>The rest of the cables that
are in this exhibit that are thicker</i>

20:59.892 --> 21:02.593
<i>are just containment cables
that are not electrified.</i>

21:02.595 --> 21:03.661
[Phillip] You're a good girl.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.796
[Jose] So these cables here
are not hotwires.

21:05.798 --> 21:11.035
That's why Happy feels comfortable weaving
her trunk in and out of these cables.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.672
<i>[Jim] Hotwire is a wire that
provides a very low voltage pulse</i>

21:14.674 --> 21:16.774
<i>if an animal touches it,</i>

21:16.776 --> 21:18.876
<i>like if you have an invisible
fence in your yard for a dog.</i>

21:18.878 --> 21:23.347
So it doesn't hurt the animal at all, and
they learn very quickly not to touch it.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.985
[Jose] Not sure if she's enjoying the
bath more than she's enjoying the fruit

21:27.987 --> 21:29.553
that Phil's giving her.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.855
[Phillip] She's multitasking.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.624
<i>[Jose] The next step would be
to just start eliminating</i>

21:33.626 --> 21:37.161
<i>hotwire on that new fence
line that they built.</i>

21:38.664 --> 21:42.667
She's so suspicious of everything.
Some animals you'll put out and they won't

21:42.669 --> 21:45.636
pick up on certain changes
in the exhibit.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.540
Happy with either go immediately to
what's different in that environment,

21:49.542 --> 21:52.677
or stay away from it 'cause
she's nervous about it.

21:52.679 --> 21:56.113
<i>We haven't seen any negative
behavior between the two animals.</i>

21:56.115 --> 21:59.483
So they're letting us know, in a
sense, that we can move forward.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.019
Here ya go, Hap. Wanna take?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.289
Good girl, Hap.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.158
Hopefully all goes well.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.207
Now we're gonna go
upstairs and get the baby

22:24.176 --> 22:26.444
and take him over
to the hospital.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.752
[peeping]

22:34.754 --> 22:38.689
[Casey] This is our young ocellated
turkey that was hatched with deformed toes.

22:38.691 --> 22:43.194
So this one has one messed
up digit in its toe right now.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.897
<i>So we're gonna take him to
the hospital, get boots on him</i>

22:46.899 --> 22:49.133
<i>to hope correct those toes.</i>

22:52.971 --> 22:57.074
<i>If we never correct it, it'll cause
later issues of potential fractures,</i>

22:57.076 --> 23:00.277
arthritis, any other joint
issues that happen in the future.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.483
[Casey whispering]
Hey, Darren.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.051
Hello, hello.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.487
How'd your drawings go?

23:11.456 --> 23:12.656
It's beautiful.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.727
I have not worked with
ocellated turkeys prior to this.

23:16.729 --> 23:22.733
I've done a lot of shoes for, like,
baby goats, and a baby guinea pig.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.103
Um, this is my first time
doing it on a baby bird.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.942
One of the best parts
of being a zoo veterinarian

23:31.944 --> 23:35.045
is our patients come
in all shapes and sizes.

23:35.047 --> 23:39.817
<i>There's nothing really on the market
for teeny little one-day-old turkey poults.</i>

23:39.819 --> 23:44.054
<i>So it is really fun to problem solve and
see how do we make this the right shape</i>

23:44.056 --> 23:46.390
and size that we
need to do the job.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.259
[Dr. Pare] For that little
guy over there.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.895
What we're gonna do is, we're
gonna extend the toes over the edges.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.765
- And flatten the foot onto that cardboard.
- [Casey] Okay.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.934
[Dr. Pare] What'd you think,
Kevin? Is it gonna work?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.170
He's really little.
And it's his first day.

23:59.172 --> 24:02.039
But I think your idea
is the right move.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.241
Let's do this.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.611
[Casey] How do you
want him held?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.113
[Dr. Pare] Yep, that's
pretty good.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.984
Right now, our turkey poults
toes are curled.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.021
So those tendons
are over-contracted.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.723
So what we need to do
is straighten them out.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.859
[Dr. Pare] Okay, you're
gonna take these little strips.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.427
Just put it right
across the toes.

24:26.665 --> 24:29.934
And one in the middle.
Like this.

24:29.936 --> 24:35.473
[Dr. Drumm] One day old and you're
already getting your designer shoes.

24:36.107 --> 24:38.409
He's not really into
the Jimmy Choos.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.680
- [Kevin] Not bad.
- [Casey] Beautiful.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.782
[Dr. Pare] Let's see
what he does.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.851
- [Dr. Pare] He's standing.
- [Dr. Drumm] What interesting things humans do.

24:46.853 --> 24:47.618
[Dr. Pare] It's better.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.787
[Kevin] Actually that is better.

24:49.789 --> 24:53.157
<i>[Dr. Drumm] Even just a day or two
of having his toe, kind of, stretched out,</i>

24:53.159 --> 24:57.995
those tendons will relax. And he'll
be able to use his toes normally.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.431
- [Dr. Drumm] All right, little one. Take him back home.
- [Kevin] Okay.

25:00.433 --> 25:03.000
- [Kevin] Thank you, sir.
- [Dr. Drumm] Thank you, guys.

25:04.736 --> 25:11.041
<i>[Ty] Come say hello. Isabella, she takes
life slow. Everything works on her time.</i>

25:11.043 --> 25:13.511
It's definitely Isabella's
world and we all live in it.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.980
Let's go on back.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.416
[Gabby] Hi baby.
Can I scoop you up?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.184
Nope. [laughs]

25:21.720 --> 25:26.023
It is really exciting to see the entire
process from chicks to where they are now.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.158
Oh, I know.
You're so ferocious.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.400
[man] See the penguin swimming
over there? Look, over there.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.335
You see it? Look.

25:43.341 --> 25:44.975
[Gabby] Scale is on.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.882
[Gabby] Hi.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.486
Hi baby. Can I scoop you up?
Hi.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.889
Nope. [laughs]

25:58.891 --> 26:04.962
Last year we received a group of little
penguins from The New England Aquarium,

26:04.964 --> 26:09.199
<i>in hopes of them breeding with the
little penguins here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

26:09.201 --> 26:11.235
[Susan] Adorable. Hello.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.003
[man] Out ya go.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.272
That's everybody.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.741
[Susan] They're just
introducing themselves.

26:17.743 --> 26:23.147
<i>[Gabby] There are only a few zoos in
North America that exhibit little penguins.</i>

26:23.982 --> 26:28.852
So it's important to have a
breeding program at the Bronx Zoo

26:28.854 --> 26:31.055
to add to that
genetic diversity.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.557
[Gabby] Hi JP.

26:33.559 --> 26:37.661
<i>JP is one of our original
birds from the Bronx Zoo.</i>

26:37.663 --> 26:43.934
<i>JP was showing some breeding behaviors
with another little penguin, Chulia.</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:47.938
<i>Unfortunately, this year they
didn't have any successful hatches.</i>

26:47.940 --> 26:51.308
But we did have two successful
hatches from another pair.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.446
Come on. Come here.

26:57.716 --> 27:00.317
<i>Our chicks are five months old,</i>

27:00.319 --> 27:03.821
<i>and we will be catching them
up for their weekly weigh-in.</i>

27:03.823 --> 27:08.359
Hi. Of course it's the deepest part of
the pool. Ya gotta go a little bit further.

27:08.526 --> 27:10.093
She's fast.

27:10.095 --> 27:15.065
<i>Today's a really big milestone
because it marks their last baby weight.</i>

27:15.067 --> 27:18.268
And after today, they'll be weighed
with the adults once a month.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.605
Oh, I know.
You're so ferocious.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.007
[Susan] He's a nibbler.

27:23.009 --> 27:27.177
This is Blue.
Because he's banned blue.

27:27.479 --> 27:33.117
1.066. So that's perfect.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.453
[Gabby] This is our chick, she is Lime
Green, because she's tagged lime green.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.725
[Susan] 950, right on target.

27:41.727 --> 27:44.094
Pretty much like
a little penguin graduation.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.463
I know you can't tell,
but I'm smiling.

27:49.134 --> 27:50.367
[Gabby] Ya ready to go swimming?

27:52.537 --> 27:54.204
And they go right back together.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.708
- [Gabby] They're good siblings.
- [woman] Yeah.

27:57.710 --> 28:02.112
[Gabby] Prior to this year, I had
not worked with little penguin chicks.

28:02.114 --> 28:05.883
<i>So it is really exciting
to see the entire process</i>

28:05.885 --> 28:07.785
<i>from chicks to
where they are now.</i>

28:07.787 --> 28:09.119
Practically adults.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.220
[Susan] They look good.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.122
Pretty cool.

28:19.264 --> 28:22.032
[man] He's looking at ya from behind
the bushes. There he is right there.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.467
[woman] Oh, beautiful.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.906
We're checking in
on our beaver, Isabella.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.842
<i>She just recently had
a procedure where we</i>

28:31.844 --> 28:35.179
evened out one of
her bottom incisors.

28:35.181 --> 28:40.317
She had broke one of her incisors,
so we wanted to do this procedure

28:40.319 --> 28:42.186
in order to even them out.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.755
Hey, Mama.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.691
She's been doing really well.
We noticed that she's been eating,

28:47.693 --> 28:49.426
she been behaving normally.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.697
Isabelly, wanna come out?
Hey, watch the door.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.332
<i>She walks over to the kitchen.</i>

28:55.334 --> 28:58.135
And then we give her one of
her favorite treats, which is a pear.

28:58.837 --> 28:59.403
There ya go.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.438
Come on out.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.140
Come say hello.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.313
She likes to take her time.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.419
All right. You hang
out right here.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.155
[bird squawking]

29:21.993 --> 29:24.161
She likes 'em when they're
nice and ripe.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.200
Ah, that looks like a good one.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.175
We'll give this
to Isabella then.

29:42.981 --> 29:44.014
Hey, Isabella.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.983
Hey!

29:49.921 --> 29:51.054
There ya go.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.161
Let's go on back.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.703
Yeah. She's eating just fine.

30:06.705 --> 30:11.008
By her eating, we can know that, something
that she doesn't have trouble with.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.844
We can make sure
that teeth are lined up.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.113
And it allows us to report
back to the vets

30:16.115 --> 30:18.148
and let them know that
she's doing really, really, well.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.150
There ya go.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.321
No trouble there.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.324
Everything looks good.

30:30.028 --> 30:34.898
Today, the veterinarians are coming to
remove the shoes off of one of the chicks.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.967
- [Dr. Drumm] There we go.
- [Dr. Pare] Look at that.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.203
[Dr. Drumm] All right.
Wanna see how you walk?

30:45.476 --> 30:47.077
[girl] Look over there.

30:51.983 --> 30:56.587
[Hector] We're going up to the brooder
room to check on the baby turkeys.

30:56.589 --> 31:00.023
And to give them a little
bit of treats.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.193
We have some mealworms here,
which they love.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.030
Hello, babies.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.171
There guys are really rare
to breed in zoos.

31:14.173 --> 31:19.042
So having them hatch was a
very good success story for us.

31:19.044 --> 31:23.013
I love coming to the brooder room
when it's just, like, me and the babies.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.149
You can learn a lot from them.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.452
[peeping]

31:34.125 --> 31:37.694
<i>[Chuck] Today, Dr. Jean Pare and Dr. Hannah
Drumm are coming to World of Birds</i>

31:37.696 --> 31:39.496
<i>to check on the turkey poults.</i>

31:39.731 --> 31:42.232
And remove the shoes off of
one of the chicks.

31:44.836 --> 31:47.170
Can I see our shoe chick?

31:48.973 --> 31:50.307
Wanna come over here?

31:55.780 --> 31:57.214
[man] How's it look? Okay?

32:02.053 --> 32:05.188
[Dr. Pare] Be careful. Sometimes
it's harder to take these things off.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.925
- [Dr. Drumm] There we go.
- [Dr. Pare] Look at that.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.826
[Dr. Drumm] All right.
Wanna see how you walk?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.228
[Dr. Pare] Let's see
what he does.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.331
That looks like a straight toe.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.001
[Dr. Drumm] Oh! Look at you!

32:19.804 --> 32:21.004
I can't even tell
which toe it was.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.673
[Dr. Pare] I can't either.

32:22.675 --> 32:26.910
It is very good to see how
the poult went from curled toes

32:26.912 --> 32:29.980
<i>to being able to bear weight
and walk around normally.</i>

32:29.982 --> 32:31.982
<i>[Chuck] It's the best year
we've had at the Bronx Zoo</i>

32:31.984 --> 32:34.685
<i>in terms of raising the species.</i>

32:34.687 --> 32:37.621
<i>At the end of the day, you hope
you wind up with a good amount</i>

32:37.623 --> 32:40.223
of healthy chicks that can
contribute to the population.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.758
And that's what
we've accomplished.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.460
<i>The next step for our</i>

32:44.262 --> 32:47.431
<i>turkey poults at the Bronx Zoo is to
get them on exhibit at World of Birds.</i>

32:54.906 --> 32:56.506
[woman gasps]
Look in the water!

32:56.808 --> 32:58.942
You see? Wow!

33:05.083 --> 33:06.283
[man 1] Ready?

33:06.350 --> 33:08.919
[man 2] You wanna start
from up there?

33:08.921 --> 33:12.956
This morning we're having the electricians
remove the hotwire that was put on

33:12.958 --> 33:15.425
to the new partition fence.

33:15.427 --> 33:19.629
<i>Because we haven't seen any negative
behavior between the two elephants.</i>

33:19.631 --> 33:25.235
<i>No aggression. They're now very
comfortable with total visual access.</i>

33:25.237 --> 33:28.405
So, they're letting us know, in a
sense, that we can move forward.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.141
[man] All right.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.778
Okay, Mary.
We're all set for Patty.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.413
[Mary over walkie-talkie]
<i>10-4.</i>

33:37.749 --> 33:40.884
<i>[Jose] They're not going to
be in the same exhibit together.</i>

33:40.886 --> 33:43.653
But they'll have access
to one and other, physically.

33:43.655 --> 33:49.126
<i>So, they can touch each other, but they
can't have 100% contact with one another.</i>

33:49.128 --> 33:52.963
<i>And we'll continue to watch carefully and
make sure that they're both comfortable.</i>

33:52.965 --> 33:55.232
[Mary] All right, Patty.

33:55.266 --> 33:58.168
<i>[Jose] Patty's very
confident in her demeanor.</i>

33:58.170 --> 34:02.105
So we just want Patty to be Patty. And,
kind of just hangout there and be relaxed.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.041
Good girl, Patty.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.145
[Phillip] Come on, Hap.
Good girl.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.449
Come here. Good girl, Happy.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.751
<i>[Jose] When Happy's
really stressed, she'll stall.</i>

34:14.753 --> 34:19.823
Kind of, hangout for a very long time
without walking out onto the exhibit.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.893
<i>So it's important for us
to pick up on these cues</i>

34:22.895 --> 34:26.063
<i>in order to transition
her carefully and slowly.</i>

34:26.998 --> 34:28.098
Good girl, Hap.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.000
There ya go.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.568
Good girl.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.937
If it works out, great. If it
doesn't work out, that's okay also.

34:33.939 --> 34:36.706
<i>So long as Happy is happy
and not stressed,</i>

34:36.708 --> 34:38.442
<i>that's what we're
here to accomplish.</i>

34:44.515 --> 34:46.383
[Jose] I think she knows
that the hotwire's gone.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.021
She's been venturing really,
really, close to where it was.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.256
They're very smart.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.759
They first thing they do when
they come out on this exhibit is

34:55.761 --> 34:59.362
analyze everything. And
they pick up on any change.

34:59.364 --> 35:02.799
It's just like you walking into the
yard and seeing something out of place,

35:02.801 --> 35:08.438
even if it's a branch on the ground that's
normally not there. You will pick up on it.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.309
She knows she can move up
a closer to that fence line now.

35:15.480 --> 35:20.817
You don't want to see her run out
there and just go right at that fence,

35:20.819 --> 35:23.420
being aggressive or
anything of that nature.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.159
- Yeah, so, how's it going?
- [Jose] Good.

35:30.094 --> 35:33.430
But they still have never made
any, sort of, sudden movements.

35:33.497 --> 35:36.500
Or, you know, testing anything.

35:36.567 --> 35:40.270
-It's very slow and calculated.
Calm -[Jose] Mm-hmm.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.574
[Phillip] So far, so good.
So far, uneventful.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.643
We'd all be thrilled
if they're side by side,

35:46.645 --> 35:49.613
right up against each other
as far as they can be,

35:49.615 --> 35:56.286
as long as we don't see any odd behavior
or anything aggressive towards each other.

36:01.792 --> 36:05.428
- [Colleen] They seem to be staying close to each other.
- [Jose] Mm-hmm.

36:07.532 --> 36:09.900
<i>[Jose] Eventually, what you'd
like to see in this situation</i>

36:09.902 --> 36:13.170
<i>is for the elephants to, kind of,
just, acknowledge each other.</i>

36:13.172 --> 36:15.539
<i>You know? But, they're
doing great!</i>

36:15.541 --> 36:17.507
We've come a long way
with these two.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.676
It means a lot that we've
actually grown their relationship,

36:19.678 --> 36:21.477
little by little.

36:21.479 --> 36:25.615
<i>I envision on of these days, you know,
maybe Patty putting her foot on the cable.</i>

36:25.617 --> 36:28.285
<i>Happy maybe touching her foot.</i>

36:28.287 --> 36:33.390
<i>Maybe wrapping trunks. Or... Something
like that would be really, really, nice.</i>

36:33.392 --> 36:36.326
<i>But, we'll see.</i>

36:39.797 --> 36:42.032
[Chuck] Come on, little guy.
You got a new home.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.701
<i>We all enjoy our jobs.</i>

36:44.735 --> 36:48.038
But when we get to do things
like this it's really rewarding.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.974
- [Susan] They're cute.
- [Chuck] Yeah, they are.

36:57.782 --> 37:00.050
[birds calling]

37:05.856 --> 37:07.657
<i>[Chuck] Today's the day
that we're moving</i>

37:07.659 --> 37:10.527
all of our young ocellated
turkeys onto exhibit.

37:11.762 --> 37:13.663
[Kevin] Okay.
We're ready to go.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.032
[Chuck] Come on, little guy.
You got a new home.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.039
- [Susan] They're cute.
- [Chuck] Yeah, they are.

37:25.209 --> 37:28.311
<i>[Chuck] They're starting to explore
their new habitat. So, that's cool.</i>

37:29.213 --> 37:32.549
[Kevin] We've come a long
way, man. It's good stuff.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.485
<i>[Chuck] I'm really happy to
see them finally on exhibit.</i>

37:35.487 --> 37:39.489
This is one of the moments that since,
you know, I knew we had fertile eggs

37:39.491 --> 37:41.992
<i>that I was really looking
forward to seeing.</i>

37:41.994 --> 37:43.260
We all enjoy our jobs.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.263
But when we get to do things
like this it's really rewarding.

37:47.465 --> 37:51.468
<i>The last ocellated turkey poults to
hatch at the Bronx Zoo was four years ago.</i>

37:51.470 --> 37:54.838
<i>And when you're managing animals,
you try to focus on conservation efforts</i>

37:54.840 --> 37:56.873
<i>and programs, so,</i>

37:56.875 --> 38:01.144
<i>I'm pretty proud of our ocellated
turkey program here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

38:01.146 --> 38:04.347
Because they are rare
in North American zoos,

38:04.349 --> 38:06.916
and the population
is decreasing.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.687
<i>I'm a firm believer in that one
institution can really contribute a lot</i>

38:10.689 --> 38:14.190
to the sustainability
of certain species.

38:14.192 --> 38:18.528
<i>So it would be nice to help other
institutions get involved in this species.</i>

38:19.497 --> 38:21.798
It's kind of cool, actually,
to see that one up there.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.002
<i>This species of turkeys
do roost in elevated areas,</i>

38:26.004 --> 38:29.372
<i>so it'll be really neat to watch
them exploring a lot of the exhibit.</i>

38:30.041 --> 38:31.508
<i>That's perfect for them.</i>

38:43.454 --> 38:45.922
I've got apples,
bananas, oranges.

38:45.924 --> 38:49.959
Just tossing these all
around this side for Patty,

38:49.961 --> 38:52.228
just as a little treat
throughout the day.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.698
We're all set.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.268
<i>[Jim] After a while of observing
Patty and Happy on exhibit together,</i>

38:58.270 --> 39:00.603
<i>we were comfortable enough
to take the hotwire down.</i>

39:00.605 --> 39:02.806
[Joe] Patty, come here.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.408
And when we did that, one of our
keepers, Joe, he saw something really neat.

39:06.043 --> 39:07.410
Want some banana?

39:08.379 --> 39:09.946
Good job, Patty.

39:09.948 --> 39:16.219
<i>I was observing the elephants. I
saw them hanging out closer together.</i>

39:16.221 --> 39:20.290
<i>Happy, sort of, offered
her trunk out to Patty.</i>

39:20.292 --> 39:22.592
<i>And Patty reciprocated.</i>

39:22.594 --> 39:24.494
I don't know exactly
what it means,

39:24.496 --> 39:30.033
but I believe that it's
almost like a handshake.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.268
Good girl.

39:32.603 --> 39:34.838
All right, Patty.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.676
So, Patty's on exhibit right now.
And we're about to pull Happy out.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.711
So she'll spend the day outside.

39:41.713 --> 39:45.148
-[walkie-talkie beeps]
-Opening up these doors. Right?

39:45.150 --> 39:46.983
[man over walkie-talkie]
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

39:47.752 --> 39:49.219
[Joe] Say hi to Patty.

39:54.358 --> 39:58.895
The relationship between these
two elephants is complex.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.432
<i>And I would consider what we did
with the exhibit and the two elephants</i>

40:02.434 --> 40:04.734
<i>this year a success.</i>

40:04.736 --> 40:09.005
<i>This modification allowed us to
have both animals out on exhibit.</i>

40:09.007 --> 40:13.143
<i>And both elephants can interact
with each other all day long.</i>

40:13.145 --> 40:16.946
<i>But there's no pressure.
There's no stress.</i>

40:16.948 --> 40:21.885
It really is important that you
constantly evaluate the situation.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.120
<i>You try to make things better.</i>

40:24.122 --> 40:26.289
<i>So we're going to keep
them together this way.</i>

40:26.291 --> 40:28.358
<i>And we'll continue
to watch them.</i>

40:28.360 --> 40:32.962
And we'll make modifications to their living
situation if we feel it's appropriate.

40:34.398 --> 40:39.436
<i>As with anything, what we want
is what's best for the animals.</i>
