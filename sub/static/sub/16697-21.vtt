(EXCLAIMS)

00:04.536 --> 00:05.705
Oh, baby!

00:09.808 --> 00:11.510
Hi, Daddy.

00:09.808 --> 00:11.510
Hey, baby.

00:11.544 --> 00:12.644
What have you and
Gracie been doing?

00:12.678 --> 00:14.147
Nothing.
Playing story.

00:14.179 --> 00:16.282
Oh, yeah? You girls
are being so good.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.083
Mommy's gonna be
so proud of you.
Thank you.

00:18.117 --> 00:19.252
Come on, Ruby.

00:22.788 --> 00:26.158
The forest fairies are
coming back with
the Blueberry King.

00:27.559 --> 00:28.760
Love you.

00:28.794 --> 00:29.829
CHERYL: Hello!

00:29.861 --> 00:31.229
Hey, hey, hey!

00:31.263 --> 00:32.731
Hey!

00:31.263 --> 00:32.731
How was
the dentist?

00:32.765 --> 00:34.267
Fine. Great.
No problem.

00:34.299 --> 00:35.734
She tried
to bite him.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.805
Cheryl, you've got to
get over this phobia
with the dentist.

00:39.838 --> 00:42.408
You're one to talk.
You are terrified
of spiders.

00:42.441 --> 00:46.679
Yeah, that's different.
Dentists can't hide
in your shoes.

00:46.712 --> 00:48.548
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad
it's over.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.416
Uh, no, it's not,
Cheryl. You still...

00:50.448 --> 00:53.452
Dana! Ix-nay on
the oot canal-ray.

00:53.485 --> 00:54.719
Oh, wait a minute.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.155
(MOUTHING)

00:59.225 --> 01:01.127
You gotta have
a root canal?

01:01.159 --> 01:03.562
Yeah. But I'm not gonna
do it. And I don't care
if all my teeth fall out.

01:03.595 --> 01:05.664
Oh, come on, Cheryl,
if that happened,
people would be saying,

01:05.697 --> 01:07.466
"What's he
doing with her?"

01:08.501 --> 01:10.537
That would just
throw things off!

01:12.605 --> 01:15.308
Come on, Cheryl.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.309
The dentist said
he'd put you under.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.511
I know, but...

01:18.543 --> 01:21.113
(CLICKING TONGUE)

01:18.543 --> 01:21.113
Come here. Come on.
Come here. Sit down.

01:21.147 --> 01:24.216
Listen. This time,
I'll go with you.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.650
You will?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.650
Yeah.

01:25.683 --> 01:27.453
Will you
hold my hand?

01:27.486 --> 01:29.555
I will hold your hand
the whole time.
And you know what?

01:29.587 --> 01:32.324
I'll have Andy drive us
so I can hug you
all the way home.

01:32.358 --> 01:35.194
Oh, honey!
That is so sweet.

01:35.227 --> 01:36.362
JIM: Baby...

01:35.227 --> 01:36.362
Yeah.

01:36.394 --> 01:38.497
You can
count on me.

01:38.531 --> 01:39.765
Oh!

01:39.798 --> 01:42.402
Look, Mommy, it's
the Blueberry King.

01:49.474 --> 01:52.311
Well, I'm gonna leave them
in your capable hands.

01:54.780 --> 01:58.751
What if Dr. Inglove screws
up and accidentally leaves
something in my mouth?

01:58.784 --> 02:00.386
I hope it's
a DVD player.

02:00.418 --> 02:01.887
What?

02:01.921 --> 02:03.623
Just trying to lighten
things up a little.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.825
Oh!

02:03.656 --> 02:05.825
Plus I broke
the DVD player.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.460
Jim!

02:07.492 --> 02:08.693
You ready, Cheryl?

02:08.727 --> 02:10.496
No, no.
You know what?
No. No.

02:10.527 --> 02:12.531
I... I'm not. I gotta
go. There's something
wrong at home.

02:12.564 --> 02:13.799
I just know it!

02:12.564 --> 02:13.799
Cheryl. Cheryl.

02:13.831 --> 02:15.433
You're not a mother!
You don't know!

02:15.467 --> 02:16.502
All right, now!
Knock her out now.
Knock her out now.

02:16.534 --> 02:17.603
Do it now! Do it now!

02:17.635 --> 02:18.837
Baby, hold my hand
the whole time!

02:18.871 --> 02:20.506
Hold my hand
the whole time!

02:20.538 --> 02:22.507
I will, honey. I'll hold
your hand the whole time.
I promise.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.709
Now, just relax.

02:23.741 --> 02:25.243
Okay.

02:23.741 --> 02:25.243
Relax.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.344
Okay.

02:26.377 --> 02:27.412
There you go.

02:27.445 --> 02:29.514
Okay. It's
not working.

02:29.548 --> 02:30.883
No, no. No,
it's not working.

02:30.915 --> 02:32.585
Give it a chance, Cheryl...

02:30.915 --> 02:32.585
No, I think it's...

02:32.617 --> 02:35.621
(GASPS) Oh, baby!

02:36.955 --> 02:38.623
Okay. She's
sleeping now.

02:38.657 --> 02:40.760
Jim! You're never
gonna believe this.

02:40.793 --> 02:44.362
I was in the pharmacy
buying pork rinds and
a home cholesterol test,

02:44.395 --> 02:45.764
and guess who
I ran into?

02:45.798 --> 02:48.266
None other than
the great Bo Diddley!

02:48.300 --> 02:50.203
Bo Diddley?
You're serious!

02:50.235 --> 02:52.537
Yeah, yeah, I talked to him.
Told him we had a blues band.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.306
You did not!

02:52.570 --> 02:54.306
Yeah.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.942
Hey, he's waiting for
his daughter downstairs.
You wanna meet him?

02:55.974 --> 02:57.909
Meet him?
I wanna have
his babies!

02:57.943 --> 03:00.413
Hey, Doc,
hit me with
some mouthwash.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.715
Mmm.

03:06.651 --> 03:07.753
Oh. Eh...

03:09.254 --> 03:10.823
(GROWLING)

03:10.855 --> 03:11.957
(SIGHING)

03:11.991 --> 03:13.826
I promised Cheryl
I'd stay with her.

03:13.859 --> 03:15.628
Aw!

03:15.661 --> 03:19.799
If only you'd put in
a clause about running
into famous blues legends.

03:19.831 --> 03:21.935
You don't think
about those things.

03:23.368 --> 03:25.471
Hey, wait a minute.

03:25.503 --> 03:29.975
Technically, I don't
have to be here,
because she's out, right?

03:31.576 --> 03:35.313
And the world
we live in

03:35.347 --> 03:38.818
doesn't exist
to her right now.

03:38.850 --> 03:42.621
For all you know, in her
world she's getting nasty
with Russell Crowe.

03:43.955 --> 03:46.358
And she's using
my hand.

03:49.061 --> 03:51.564
Hey, Doc.
How long is
she gonna be out?

03:51.597 --> 03:52.865
Two hours.

03:51.597 --> 03:52.865
Cheryl?

03:54.599 --> 03:55.800
Cheryl?

03:55.834 --> 03:57.236
(VIBRATING LIPS LOUDLY)

03:58.736 --> 03:59.871
I peed in the bushes.

04:01.372 --> 04:02.774
Your thighs look
really fat today.

04:03.908 --> 04:05.777
Oh, yeah.
She's out.
Let's go.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.881
JIM: Oh, wow. Cool.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.516
Excuse me,
Mr. Diddley,
uh, Bo.

04:11.550 --> 04:12.986
Yo, what's up, Slim?

04:14.652 --> 04:15.888
He's named me.

04:14.652 --> 04:15.888
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.957
Oh, this is Jim.
He's the harp player
in my band.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.358
Your band?

04:20.391 --> 04:21.927
I don't ask for much.
Just give me this.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.830
All right, all right.
It's not his band,
it's mine.

04:25.997 --> 04:28.334
Wow. What
happened there?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.369
(EXCLAIMS)

04:30.668 --> 04:32.904
Ingrown toenail.

04:32.937 --> 04:35.641
And the pain
is ugly, man.

04:37.509 --> 04:38.843
You gonna write
a song about it?

04:38.877 --> 04:40.913
Now, why should
I do that, huh?

04:42.113 --> 04:44.449
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:44.483 --> 04:47.887
Hello. Bo's listening.
What's up?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.056
(STAMMERING)
Don't worry about
it, baby girl.

04:50.088 --> 04:53.526
Uh, Bo'll get a taxi. Bye.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.593
Everything all right?

04:54.625 --> 04:55.794
No.

04:57.829 --> 05:02.834
Baby girl's kids got sick
today at school.
And she can't pick me up.

05:02.867 --> 05:06.372
Would you guys
flag Bo a taxi?

05:06.404 --> 05:08.407
Where does
Bo live?

05:10.843 --> 05:12.944
About 10 minutes
from here.

05:12.978 --> 05:16.615
Ten minutes?
I mean, that's...
That's nothing.

05:16.648 --> 05:18.517
You don't have to
take a taxi.
We'll give you a ride.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.786
Oh, you'd do that for
me, Harp Player Jim?

05:20.819 --> 05:23.956
Oh, he just named me.
Harp Player Jim.

05:23.988 --> 05:25.657
What, what do you mean?
What about Cheryl?

05:25.690 --> 05:29.728
Please, Cheryl. Come on, she's
up there sharing a cigarette
with Russell Crowe right now.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.898
Look, it's 20 minutes.
She'll be out for
another hour and half.

05:32.930 --> 05:35.433
Come on,
Mr. Diddley.
Let's go.

05:35.466 --> 05:37.969
Oh, man. I've been
a big fan... Andy!
Andy! Where you going?

05:38.002 --> 05:39.671
Oh, I'll meet
you out front.

05:39.704 --> 05:43.709
I'm gonna exchange
this cholesterol test
for more pork rinds.

05:43.742 --> 05:46.712
Okay. You know, my band
is a really great band.

05:46.745 --> 05:49.682
I'm the harp player,
of course, and I'm the singer.
I have all kinds of...

05:49.714 --> 05:50.849
(SCREAMING)

05:50.882 --> 05:52.951
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.822
Oh, man, let me get
this. Let me get
that for you.

06:00.459 --> 06:02.595
That was a pretty good
lunch there, Slim.

06:02.627 --> 06:05.730
Sorry it took me three
times to melt the cheese
the way you like it.

06:05.764 --> 06:07.567
Bo don't like
the bubbles.

06:09.634 --> 06:12.570
All right.
Your fish are fed.

06:12.603 --> 06:16.741
Plants are watered.
Your laundry is in
the dryer, Mr. Diddley.

06:16.774 --> 06:20.012
You didn't put my undies
in there, did you?

06:20.045 --> 06:23.482
No, no, no. I hung them
over the shower rod
like you asked me.

06:23.514 --> 06:26.485
So, sorry, but
we got to get going.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.054
Well, I guess the dishes
can wait till morning.

06:30.988 --> 06:33.158
Bo does have
a problem with ants.

06:35.026 --> 06:36.428
Okay.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.434
Oh, great. Cheryl's
still under.

06:41.466 --> 06:43.601
Wow. Bo sure
can talk, huh?

06:43.634 --> 06:46.438
What did I tell you?
No matter what it says
on a bumper sticker,

06:46.471 --> 06:48.706
don't ask about
their grandkids.

06:48.740 --> 06:52.677
Sorry. That Lamont
sounds like a real pistol.

were we gone?

Uh, Doc,
where's Cheryl?

07:21.038 --> 07:22.942
Oh, she's in the
other office recovering.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.710
And don't worry,
she's gonna be fine...

07:24.742 --> 07:27.178
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, whatever.
Was she awake?

07:27.211 --> 07:30.182
No. But she should
be coming out of it
just about now.

(MUFFLED) Is it a boy,
Jim? If it's a boy,
we can stop.

07:50.735 --> 07:54.507
No. Honey, you had
a root canal, and the
doctor said it went great.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.009
I had a root canal
and a baby?

07:58.744 --> 08:01.146
You just had
dental surgery.

08:01.178 --> 08:04.849
Oh! Oh, yeah, honey.

08:04.882 --> 08:06.217
And I never could
have done it

08:06.250 --> 08:09.854
if you weren't with
me the whole time.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.824
That's because I was
with you the whole time.

08:12.858 --> 08:15.694
Yeah. I could feel you.

08:16.627 --> 08:18.697
And I could feel you

08:19.730 --> 08:20.733
feeling me.

08:22.199 --> 08:24.769
It's like
we're one person.

08:24.802 --> 08:28.641
Well, honey, that's what
it feels like when you
marry the perfect guy.

08:29.740 --> 08:30.841
Good job, honey.

08:32.311 --> 08:36.048
Honey, would you
hand me that water?
I'm really thirsty.

08:36.081 --> 08:37.582
Here you go, baby.

numb. Cheryl...

08:42.187 --> 08:44.222
Oh, that really
hit the spot.

08:48.860 --> 08:49.995
So is your mouth
still sore?

08:50.028 --> 08:52.130
It's not so bad.
You know what?

08:52.163 --> 08:55.167
I couldn't have done it
without Jim. He was
really there for me.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.302
Do you know
he held my hand
the entire time?

08:57.336 --> 08:59.672
(DOORBELL RINGING)

08:59.705 --> 09:02.675
Yeah. Now I kind of feel bad
about lying down in front of
your wedding limo.

09:06.144 --> 09:09.280
(LAUGHING) Oh! Thank you!

09:09.313 --> 09:11.583
Who's that from?

09:11.616 --> 09:14.786
Oh, I'm guessing a pretty
terrific guy wishing me
a speedy recovery.

yesterday afternoon
and doing my laundry.

the tuna melt
was Bo-licious."

But yesterday afternoon...

09:39.110 --> 09:42.181
Bo Diddley?
Jim met Bo Diddley?

09:42.214 --> 09:45.151
Yeah, but, but how could he
do that? He was with me...

09:47.385 --> 09:49.254
Oh, my God!

09:49.287 --> 09:52.291
Jim abandoned you
while you
were unconscious!

And he did laundry!

I'm so glad
you're home.

I have a special
treat for you.

it under there?

No. No.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.086
Look at this, huh?

Wow! Look at that!

10:30.895 --> 10:32.130
Honey, if you really
wanted to thank me

10:32.163 --> 10:35.100
a case of beer and some
snow tires would have
done the trick.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.136
Oh, honey.
Read the note.

10:37.168 --> 10:38.803
Oh! Girls
with their cards!

10:38.836 --> 10:40.139
I know.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.173
(CHUCKLING)

10:42.039 --> 10:43.375
(WHISPERS) Bo Diddley.

10:47.178 --> 10:49.313
You know what, honey?
I love you so much

10:49.346 --> 10:53.718
that when I'm through
with this, I'm gonna
give you the basket.

10:53.751 --> 10:55.153
How could you
leave me there alone?

10:55.187 --> 10:57.923
Oh, honey. It was
Bo Diddley, come on!

10:57.956 --> 11:00.192
You were completely out.
You didn't even know
I was gone.

11:00.225 --> 11:02.027
Yeah, but
that doesn't matter!
I need to know that

11:02.059 --> 11:04.796
I can count on you to
follow through even if
I'm not gonna find out.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.699
Oh, come on.
Will you look at it
from my position

11:06.731 --> 11:08.100
for a minute,
all right?

11:08.134 --> 11:12.370
What if you had
an opportunity to hang out
with some famous housewife?

11:14.339 --> 11:16.175
Huh?

11:14.339 --> 11:16.175
Yeah. Like who?

11:16.207 --> 11:19.010
Like, like, like,
I don't know.

11:19.043 --> 11:20.913
I can't help it
if I'm your whole
universe, honey.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.047
Oh.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.184
Oh, I'm just kidding,
for crying out loud.

11:25.216 --> 11:27.151
It's no big deal,
all right?

11:27.184 --> 11:28.986
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.822
It's never gonna
happen again.

11:30.855 --> 11:33.225
Like that time I made
that beer milkshake.

11:34.993 --> 11:36.061
I don't believe you.

11:36.094 --> 11:39.131
Honey, you were there.
I was foaming
from both ends.

11:41.533 --> 11:45.204
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
That's right.
I remember. I remember.

11:45.236 --> 11:49.307
And I was there for you.
The whole time, no matter
how disgusting you got.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.943
Because that is
the kind of
person I am.

11:51.976 --> 11:53.812
Yes, you are
like that.

11:53.845 --> 11:55.480
Yes, and apparently,
you're not that
kind of person.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.014
I am that
kind of person.

11:57.048 --> 12:00.186
Hmm. Well, I guess
time will tell.

12:02.386 --> 12:03.821
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

12:03.855 --> 12:04.990
Nothing.

12:06.557 --> 12:10.062
Ha. You don't
even know me!

12:10.095 --> 12:12.398
CHERYL: You're eating the
chocolates, aren't you?

12:14.566 --> 12:16.067
No!

12:23.575 --> 12:25.778
All right, sweetie.
We're going to be
back about 11:00.

12:25.811 --> 12:26.845
Okay.

12:26.878 --> 12:28.113
Mommy?

12:26.878 --> 12:28.113
Yeah.

12:28.145 --> 12:30.314
Can we come to the movies
with you and Aunt Dana?

12:30.347 --> 12:32.317
Uh, no, baby. It's
a grown-up movie.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.819
Do they say
bad words?

12:33.851 --> 12:37.990
Do they say, "Stupid"?
Do they say, "Shut up"?

12:38.023 --> 12:41.192
Well...

12:38.023 --> 12:41.192
Do they say
S-E-X?

12:42.126 --> 12:44.362
Oh!

12:44.395 --> 12:48.132
No, sweetie, actually, it's
just a movie where people
talk about their feelings.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.068
If nothing blows up,
it ain't a movie.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.102
Yes.

12:52.370 --> 12:54.072
All right, my
loves. Be good.

12:54.105 --> 12:56.008
Oh, and honey,
when the kids go
to sleep tonight...

12:56.041 --> 12:57.810
Yes?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.810
Can you stay here?

12:57.842 --> 12:59.077
(DANA GIGGLING)

13:00.979 --> 13:02.980
Oh, I'm sorry.
This came for you.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.783
Love you.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.783
Love you.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.019
ANDY: Hey, Jim.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.019
Yeah?

13:07.052 --> 13:09.555
I found out a way
to make popcorn
in man-sized portions.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.025
The dryer.

13:15.559 --> 13:18.329
Hey, hey, hey.
Check this out!
Look at this!

13:18.363 --> 13:23.001
VIP tickets. Backstage passes
for Bo Diddley at the
Kingston Mines tonight!

13:23.033 --> 13:24.302
How cool is that?

13:24.336 --> 13:26.038
Wow! From the
man himself!

13:26.071 --> 13:28.005
Wow! Does it say
anything about
free food?

13:28.038 --> 13:30.141
This popcorn tastes
a little linty.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.447
Wait a minute.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.382
I know what
this is about.

13:37.414 --> 13:38.817
(CHUCKLING)

13:39.918 --> 13:42.453
She is so obvious!

13:42.486 --> 13:43.921
What're you...
What're you
talking about?

13:43.955 --> 13:44.990
She's setting me up.

13:45.023 --> 13:47.926
Come on. Out of the blue,
she's going to the movies?

13:47.958 --> 13:51.028
And these tickets just
happened to show up?

13:51.062 --> 13:52.998
Are you saying
this is a setup?

13:53.030 --> 13:55.834
Yes, Andy.
That's what I said.
And I explained it.

13:58.336 --> 14:01.173
I can't believe her.
She actually thinks
I'm gonna ditch the kids

14:01.206 --> 14:05.344
to go to this thing
so she can catch me
"not being there for her."

14:05.376 --> 14:08.346
Yeah, but, what if
Cheryl had nothing to do
with these tickets?

14:08.379 --> 14:09.947
Maybe they really
are from Bo.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.451
I mean, you hand-washed
the guy's underpants!

14:13.485 --> 14:16.120
Come on. Come on.
We're talking about
Cheryl here.

14:16.153 --> 14:19.457
She got nothing
to do all day
but plot against me.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.162
I'm not gonna
fall for it.

14:25.163 --> 14:27.365
(GRUNTING)

14:27.399 --> 14:32.169
You know, maybe, uh,
maybe she doesn't spend
all her time plotting.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.305
I mean, this house
is pretty clean.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.912
All right.
Let's go!

14:39.945 --> 14:42.014
No. Wait a minute.
This is a trap.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.683
No, we're staying.

14:45.716 --> 14:49.654
It's Bo Diddley!
We're going!

14:49.687 --> 14:53.192
No! That's exactly what
she wants me to think!
We're staying.

14:57.562 --> 14:59.932
We're going,
aren't we?

14:57.562 --> 14:59.932
Yup. let's go.

15:01.265 --> 15:04.302
Oh! What about
Maisy and Daisy here?

15:04.336 --> 15:06.971
(EXHALING FORCEFULLY)

15:07.004 --> 15:08.941
Oh, Marilyn.
Thank you
for coming over.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.042
What's the emergency?

15:10.075 --> 15:12.610
Oh, I have to get to
the hospital ASTP.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.679
What... What's wrong?

15:14.712 --> 15:18.082
Well, it seems like Andy is...
He just keeps falling down!

15:18.115 --> 15:21.186
Oh, baby!
Here it comes!

15:21.219 --> 15:23.155
Oh, my God!

15:21.219 --> 15:23.155
I know!

15:23.187 --> 15:24.322
What happened
to him?

15:24.355 --> 15:27.426
I don't know.
Apparently, a beetle
crawled into his ear!

15:27.458 --> 15:28.559
Oh!

15:28.592 --> 15:31.495
It's eating my brain!

15:31.528 --> 15:33.664
JIM: Look at him!
Oh, look at that!

15:33.697 --> 15:35.167
(ANDY GRUNTING)

15:35.200 --> 15:36.668
Oh, Marilyn, I hate
to do this to you,

15:36.701 --> 15:38.704
but can you watch
the kids, please?

15:36.701 --> 15:38.704
Oh, yes.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.706
Oh, I can
hear it chewing!

15:40.739 --> 15:42.139
(GRUNTING)

15:42.173 --> 15:43.508
(SCREAMING)

15:43.541 --> 15:46.244
Of course!

15:43.541 --> 15:46.244
Oh, thank you
so much, Marilyn.

15:46.277 --> 15:48.113
Go!

15:46.277 --> 15:48.113
Thank you so much. Oh, Andy.

15:48.145 --> 15:49.180
Now!

15:48.145 --> 15:49.180
Andy! Andy.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.250
Oh, thank you so...

15:57.489 --> 16:01.225
Oh, I just want to make
sure I get a picture
with me and the beetle.

16:12.803 --> 16:14.472
I looked all through
the club, Jim.

16:14.505 --> 16:15.639
Even the
ladies' room?

16:15.673 --> 16:18.110
Every stall.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.480
You wouldn't believe
the attitude
I got in there.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.716
Cheryl is
definitely not here.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.187
What's your
game, blondie?

16:29.421 --> 16:32.324
What's your game?

16:32.356 --> 16:35.092
I gotta tell you.
I don't think
there is a game.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.228
I really think
she went to
the movies.

16:37.261 --> 16:40.097
Huh. Maybe you're right.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.601
That's the game.
Trust.

16:43.634 --> 16:46.071
She trusts me.
That's the game, see?

16:46.104 --> 16:48.206
And obviously,
I'm untrustworthy,
right?

16:48.239 --> 16:49.740
Uh-huh.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.509
So, I win
the game!

16:51.543 --> 16:52.644
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:52.677 --> 16:54.646
Check and mate,
my funky brother.

16:54.678 --> 16:57.149
Are you ready
for some blues
and some booze?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.517
Drunk and sad?
I'm there!

16:58.549 --> 17:00.051
All right!

17:04.122 --> 17:05.289
ANDY: What's the matter?

17:05.323 --> 17:07.659
I can't do it.
Cheryl trusts me
too much.

17:07.692 --> 17:09.627
Oh, what're you
talking about?

17:09.661 --> 17:12.596
You're Jim,
baby. Huh?

17:12.630 --> 17:14.800
You do this kind
of stuff all the time.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.667
Yes, I do!

17:14.833 --> 17:16.667
Yeah!

17:16.701 --> 17:18.202
Release the hound!

17:18.236 --> 17:20.204
The animal is out
of his cage!

17:20.238 --> 17:21.807
Uncage him. Come on!
Give me some!

17:21.839 --> 17:23.808
Come on, baby, come on!

17:21.839 --> 17:23.808
Is that all you got?

17:23.842 --> 17:26.178
Oh, I got
more than that!

17:31.682 --> 17:35.086
Oh, I can't
believe this.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.822
I can totally
get away with this.

17:37.855 --> 17:40.659
But there's something
inside me that's just

17:40.692 --> 17:42.693
stopping me!

17:42.727 --> 17:44.196
You mean guilt?

17:44.229 --> 17:46.465
I don't know what
the medical term is.

17:47.898 --> 17:51.135
I just... I mean, I just
can't do the wrong thing.

17:51.169 --> 17:53.405
Come on, now.

17:51.169 --> 17:53.405
No, it's...
I don't know what it is!

17:53.438 --> 17:55.107
Don't beat
yourself up.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.241
(SIGHING)

17:56.273 --> 17:58.342
You tried to do
the wrong thing.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.383
Thanks, Andy.

18:05.517 --> 18:09.455
I'm gonna...go home?

18:11.522 --> 18:12.757
Yeah.

18:14.491 --> 18:17.229
Hey! You know,

18:17.261 --> 18:20.098
if you see Bo, tell him
hi from Harp Player Jim.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.169
If it comes up.

18:24.201 --> 18:26.471
WOMAN: That's him!
The weirdo from
the ladies' room!

18:26.503 --> 18:27.805
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

18:34.578 --> 18:36.514
Oh, honey.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.651
What a great movie.
Meryl Streep plays
this deaf woman,

18:39.683 --> 18:43.254
and she can only speak
in sign language and...

18:43.288 --> 18:45.856
I've lost you
already, haven't I?

18:45.890 --> 18:49.194
Cheryl, what're you
doing to me here?

18:50.295 --> 18:51.863
What?

18:51.895 --> 18:53.565
You know that
envelope you gave me?

18:53.597 --> 18:54.699
Yeah.

18:54.732 --> 18:57.501
It had tickets in it
to the Bo Diddley
concert tonight

18:57.535 --> 18:59.304
at the Kingston Mines.
And you know what?

18:59.336 --> 19:00.504
What?

18:59.336 --> 19:00.504
I went.

19:00.538 --> 19:01.839
You what?

19:00.538 --> 19:01.839
I went.

19:01.873 --> 19:04.543
But you know what?
I couldn't go in.
You know why?

19:04.576 --> 19:08.547
Because you
trusted me!

19:08.579 --> 19:11.949
Wait a minute.
You took our
children, our babies,

19:11.982 --> 19:13.751
into some
smoky nightclub?

19:13.785 --> 19:17.389
Of course not!
I dumped them
on Marilyn Crannis.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.924
Oh! You are
unbelievable!

19:19.958 --> 19:22.527
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Don't make
this about me.

19:22.559 --> 19:24.461
This is about you, baby!

19:24.494 --> 19:26.197
What? How is
this about me?

19:26.230 --> 19:28.799
Because you
trusted me,

19:28.833 --> 19:30.936
and because
I love you so much,

19:30.969 --> 19:33.672
I had no choice
but to live up to it.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.942
Damn it!

19:36.974 --> 19:39.410
All right. So...
So, let me get
this straight.

19:39.443 --> 19:40.711
You went to do
something wrong,

19:40.744 --> 19:42.680
you couldn't do it, so,
now you're mad at me?

19:42.713 --> 19:45.849
Yeah. Now, we're
on the same page,
finally.

19:45.883 --> 19:48.953
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for making
you a better person.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.556
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
I hope you're
happy, Cheryl.

19:51.588 --> 19:55.292
You took this wild animal
out of the jungle,
put him in a cage,

19:55.326 --> 19:59.597
and make him perform
little tricks in your
suburban circus!

20:00.464 --> 20:01.699
(LAUGHING)

20:01.732 --> 20:04.435
What? That's
not funny!

20:04.469 --> 20:06.471
Suburban circus?

20:04.469 --> 20:06.471
Yes!

20:07.337 --> 20:08.706
That's really funny.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.276
Yeah, it's kind of
funny, I guess.

20:11.976 --> 20:13.511
Little bit, but...

20:13.544 --> 20:14.579
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

20:14.612 --> 20:15.913
What?

20:15.946 --> 20:18.649
Oh, I'm not 100% sure,

20:18.682 --> 20:21.853
but I think I might
be a little bit
proud of you.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.387
Really?

20:21.885 --> 20:23.387
Yeah.

20:24.689 --> 20:25.757
Why?

20:25.789 --> 20:26.957
Well, I mean,
honey, you didn't

20:26.990 --> 20:28.960
completely do
the wrong thing
tonight.

20:28.992 --> 20:31.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute!

20:28.992 --> 20:31.428
What?

20:31.461 --> 20:33.731
I was half-wrong.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.734
There's still
hope for me.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.836
Oh, honey.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.836
Mommy! Mommy!

20:37.868 --> 20:39.637
We're afraid of
the brain beetles.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.340
They're gonna crawl
in our ears.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.908
What's that
all about?

20:43.941 --> 20:46.711
That's the half of me
that you'll never tame.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.403
Yeah!

21:25.482 --> 21:28.819
Get the... Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey,
get out of here.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.926
Just go. Go. Go. Go.

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
