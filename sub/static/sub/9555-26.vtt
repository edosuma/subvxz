But Chachi's here.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.088
Your dime, shoot.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.454
Oh, hi, Judy.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.084
Thanks for calling me back.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.526
Hey, listen, I can't afford
to take you to the movies.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.497
But, uh... how about
if I come over?

01:40.634 --> 01:41.999
(line clicks)

01:42.135 --> 01:43.796
Hello?

01:44.838 --> 01:46.829
Hello?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.872
Ah, women.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.875
You get a little short
on the bucks,

01:51.011 --> 01:53.309
and they turn on you.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.642
- Hey, Chachi.
- Hey, Rich.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.341
Hey, listen, uh...

01:57.484 --> 01:59.714
you seen Fonzie around?
I got a problem.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.446
Well, he's still out to lunch.
Why? What's up?

02:01.588 --> 02:03.386
Aw, Ralph went away
on his family reunion.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.423
I got to find a piano player.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.459
Hey, I'll do it for five bucks.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.756
- I didn't know you played.
- I don't.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.125
But I figured
I'd use two bucks for a date

02:11.264 --> 02:12.857
and the other three
for piano lessons.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.627
Pass. No, I'll pass.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.105
(rhythmic rattling)

02:18.238 --> 02:20.229
Hey, Fonz.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.300
Hey, this is Leilani.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.935
She works at the Pineapple Hut.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.108
(rattling)

02:32.886 --> 02:35.378
She just told you what
the special was for today.

02:35.522 --> 02:36.489
Oh, great.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.387
I'll have one to go.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.090
Uh, so, she doesn't talk?

02:41.228 --> 02:42.559
She don't have to.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.063
Saturday night,
Pineapple Hut, 8:00.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.666
(rattling)

02:46.800 --> 02:49.360
All right, all right,
all right! 7:30.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.028
- Oh, Fonz, listen.
- Yeah.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.298
Do you know a piano player?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.407
I got to find a piano player.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.168
Well, I-l know a piano teacher.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.174
Oh, yeah? Do you,
do you think she could play

02:57.310 --> 02:58.175
with our band Saturday night?

02:58.311 --> 02:59.210
No, Saturday night

02:59.346 --> 03:00.313
she's giving me a lesson

03:00.447 --> 03:02.506
in my key-

03:02.649 --> 03:04.014
Well, I don't know.
I'd better get going.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.846
I got this sudden urge
for pineapple.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.148
Bye, Richie.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.255
- Uh, Fonz?
- Yeah?

03:11.391 --> 03:12.881
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.619
Oh, yeah, sure.
My ears are all yours.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.751
Conversate with me.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.864
Okay, uh,
I was talking to, um...

03:17.998 --> 03:19.830
- Fonz...?
- Speak up, speak up!

03:19.966 --> 03:21.092
All right.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.861
Fonz, can I talk
to you for a minute?!

03:23.904 --> 03:25.531
L-I'm sorry. It's important.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.231
It's important?
You got to tell me these things.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.967
- It's about Judy.
- Yeah, what about her?

03:29.109 --> 03:30.406
She wants to go to the movies.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.841
- Oh, that's good.
- But I don't have any money.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.639
- Oh, that's bad.
- I want a raise.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.145
- That's out.
- Oh...

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
Fonz, you know how expensive
it is to take

03:37.350 --> 03:38.579
somebody to the movies
these days?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.710
Yeah, my dates
keep telling me that.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.583
Aw, come on, what's
a few more bucks a week?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.588
You know,
I'll tell you something.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.589
You don't get no raise, huh?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.590
Where's your get-up-and-go?

03:45.726 --> 03:46.591
This is America.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.559
Land of opportunities.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.685
"Opportunities"?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.060
What you mean is
another part-time job.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.827
You know what Grandma Nussbaum
always used to say?

03:54.968 --> 03:57.528
"A penny earned

03:57.671 --> 04:00.333
is a sailor's delight."

04:02.642 --> 04:05.976
I never did understand
Grandma Nussbaum.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.551
You all right, Al?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.788
Oh, I'm fine.
I always warm up like this

04:22.929 --> 04:26.058
before I do my piano exercises.

- Well, there must be somebody.

another guitar player.

- Yeah.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.431
Oh, Al, do you mind?

04:33.573 --> 04:34.904
We're trying
to concentrate here.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.839
Could you practice
the piano on another table?

Bink.

Hey, wait a minute.
Al could play the piano.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.513
Oh, I don't know.
I get so busy here.

04:45.652 --> 04:46.642
- Yeah, Al's right.
- Yeah, he'll get busy.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.017
I'll do it!

04:49.156 --> 04:51.056
Okay, everybody,
gather round.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.454
Come on, clear the table, folks.

Oh, I'm sorry, Chach,
but I got all the wax I need.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.430
Hold it, Al.

05:06.573 --> 05:07.904
Let your eyes be the judge.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.806
I'll give you
a free demonstration.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.412

05:32.866 --> 05:34.630
Hey, man,
you could eat off this table.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.827
- Yeah, hey, Chach, let me have
one of those. -Terrific.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.132
-(excited chattering)
- Hey, Chachi, count me in.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.569
I think Mom would like
one of those, don't you?

05:40.707 --> 05:42.641
Yeah. Hey,
will it work on shoes?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.437
Certainly it works on shoes.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.773

06:00.126 --> 06:02.356
- Mar... oh!
- Oh!

06:02.495 --> 06:05.123
Do you have to pop up
at people like that?

06:05.265 --> 06:06.494
I'm sorry, dear.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.828
I was just looking
for my cookie sheet.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.096
Uh, is Joanie feeling better?

06:10.237 --> 06:11.966
Well, her temperature's down
and her complaints are up,

06:12.105 --> 06:13.334
so I guess she's better.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.202
- Oh, good.
-(loud clattering)

06:15.342 --> 06:16.537
Marion.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.940
You see, having the Andersons
over for bridge

06:19.079 --> 06:20.774
makes you so nervous, Howard.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.746
I am not nervous.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.647
Don't try that again, Marion.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.377
Whatever you say, dear.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.681
To the untrained eye,
I may seem to be nervous,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.688
but I'm really all psyched up,
Marion.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.656
I've got my brain on "go."

06:32.792 --> 06:34.317
And I feel mentally alert

06:34.461 --> 06:35.951
and that's going to give me
that competitive edge.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.393
I'll tell you something,
Marion.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.827
I feel like I have
the killer instinct.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.160
Marion, where are you?

06:40.300 --> 06:41.665
Mari... (yells)

06:41.801 --> 06:44.168
What are you trying
to do to me?

06:44.304 --> 06:45.294
- Hi, Mom.
- MARION: Oh, Richard,

06:45.438 --> 06:46.735
- Lori Beth. -HOWARD: Oh, hi.
- Hi.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.637
- We, uh waxed your card table.
- Oh.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.334
We used Chachi's wax.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.673
- It's really good stuff.
- Terrific.

06:52.812 --> 06:53.973
Uh.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.604
Oh, you do that well, Dad.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.275
No, no, I saw a guy on
Beat the <i>Clock</i> the other day

06:58.418 --> 07:00.580
and he couldn't open
a card table.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.918
Of course, he was wearing
boxing gloves and a blindfold.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.890
Howard, do you want a blindfold?

07:07.027 --> 07:10.053
No, I'd rather have
the boxing gloves, Marion.

07:10.196 --> 07:13.166
Wait a minute,
is this our old card table?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.564
Yep, we polished
the chairs, too.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.136
Well, it's just beautiful.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.534
It looks just like real Formica.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.803
- I'll get the cards.
- Okay.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.469
Uh, well, we're going to go
to Arnold's now, Dad.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.944
- No, no, no, no, just a minute,
you two. -RICHIE: What?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.345
Marion and I have to practice
our bridge signals,

07:30.483 --> 07:32.747
and I need you two to pretend
to be the Andersons.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.217
Sit, sit.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.085
Gonna practice your cheating,
huh, Dad?

07:37.223 --> 07:39.453
I do not cheat, Richard.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.391
The Andersons cheat, and you
have to fight fire with fire.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.056
Now, you'll be Mr. Anderson
and you'll be Mrs. Anderson.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.667
Oh, my, my. my-

07:47.801 --> 07:50.099
Oh, your house looks so lovely,
darling,

07:50.236 --> 07:52.398
and I just love those drapes.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.099
Well, thank you, Margaret, but
I've just had them for ages.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.902
Marion.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.777
Eh, uh, (exhales loudly)

08:02.916 --> 08:05.044
We're really going
to skin you tonight, Howie.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.516
(deep laugh)

08:06.653 --> 08:09.782
That's enough, Richard.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.153
Oh, I think it's cute, Howard.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.784
They sound just like
the Andersons.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.260
(laughs) Howie, how's that son
of yours doing, huh?

08:17.397 --> 08:19.092
Fine young boy.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.735
Smart-alecky as ever.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.503
Now, Marion, look at me.

08:25.638 --> 08:29.097
When you see me put my hand
over my heart,

08:29.242 --> 08:31.370
what does that mean?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.741
They're playing
the National Anthem.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.077
Oh, good one, Marion.
Good one.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.583
Oh, yeah, well, they always were
a funny couple.

08:39.719 --> 08:40.948
(Lori Beth cackles)

08:41.087 --> 08:42.179
I could tell you one time
Howie...

08:42.322 --> 08:44.484
You're pushing it, Richard.

08:45.925 --> 08:48.587
Marion, when I put my hand
over my heart,

08:48.728 --> 08:50.890
that means I have spades.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.726
Why doesn't it mean hearts?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.197
Because that's too obvious.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.893
You have to be clever.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.731
Howie, why don't you try
being really clever

08:57.871 --> 08:59.270
and learn to play bridge?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.773
LORI BETH (cackling):
Oh, my, good one, dear.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.502
Good one. (cackles)

09:04.644 --> 09:08.171
Pick up your cards,
we'll play a quick hand.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.548
LORI BETH: Hey, the cards
are stuck to the table.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.948
HOWARD:
What is this?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.148
Well, that's one way
to finally win, Howie.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.157
- Oh, Howard, now you've gone
too far. -|...

09:20.293 --> 09:22.455
I'm going to go in
and get a damp cloth.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.155
But I didn't...
What is...?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.461
Oh, Mom, I'll help you.
I...

09:28.601 --> 09:31.161
- Oh...
- Richie, I'm stuck.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.499
- I can't move.
- Richie.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.800
What is this?

09:33.940 --> 09:36.204
You know, uh, I saw a guy
on Beat the Clock...

09:36.342 --> 09:37.639
Richard!

09:37.777 --> 09:40.405
Margaret, when I walk around
with my chair like this,

09:40.547 --> 09:42.515
it means I have spades.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.980
MARION: Oh!

09:51.257 --> 09:53.248
(Al coughing)

09:54.594 --> 09:57.427
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

09:59.632 --> 10:00.827
(coin jingling)

10:01.868 --> 10:04.303
Al, Al, where is that Chachi?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.098
I'm trying to get him
on the phone right now.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.334
Good. I waxed
my new saddle shoes.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.410
Look at them.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.069
Oh, he's not answering.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.012
He probably waxed his phone.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.417
Hey, Lori Beth, Al,
look at this.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.220
LORI BETH: What is it?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.983
Before I used Chachi's wax
on it,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.685
it was my bowling ball.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.124
POTSIE (calling):
ls Jennifer in there?!

10:29.262 --> 10:30.593
- No.
- No.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.027
POTSIE:
Are you sure?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.223
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.698
Potsie, come on out here.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:52.452 --> 10:55.183
RICHIE, LORI BETH & AL:
You put it on your hair.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.551
Where is he?
Where is that little twerp?

10:57.690 --> 10:59.055
I don't know-- look what
he did to my shoes.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.921
-(overlapping talking)
- The table-- look at the table.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.859
- Oh, my.
- Totally burnt out.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.295
(overlapping talking
continues)

11:06.432 --> 11:07.524
Hi, everybody.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.896
How'd the wax work?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.860
Bye. everybody.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.302
POTSIE:
Let's get him!

11:13.439 --> 11:14.964
AL:

- Hey, Richie.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.561
Where's Chachi?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.497
What do I look like,
my cousin's keeper?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.124
Just wait
till I get my hands on him.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.361
I mean, Fonz, I'm telling you.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.733
Just wait till
I get my hands on him.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.340
All right, slow down,
you're gonna bust something.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.305
- Now, what's up?
- He's ruined everything.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.070
I mean, my bowling ball...
(makes warbling sound)

11:52.212 --> 11:53.373
My father's card table,

11:53.513 --> 11:55.003
Lori Beth's shoes,
Potsie's hair.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.014
I mean, you should just see
Potsie's hair.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.016
I tell you,
I'm gonna get Chachi.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.484
All right, hey, look,
get him later-- talk now.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.865
-(snapping fingers)
- Hey, are you home?

12:12.999 --> 12:15.593
Oh, yeah, Fonz. Uh...

12:15.735 --> 12:17.533
Chachi's selling stuff.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.535
Yeah, I know that.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.638
It's called lncredo-Wax.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.796
I bought some.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.806
Yeah, I thought so.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.967
Shined up my seat.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.409
I can see that.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.208
I like to encourage the kid

12:29.349 --> 12:31.317
when he shows
some get-up-and-go.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.250
That's not all
that's getting up and going.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.020
All right...

12:41.060 --> 12:43.427
Now, Fonz, Fonz,
just-just take it easy.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.793
I mean, it's only your
motorcycle seat, right?

12:45.932 --> 12:48.424
Did you say "only"
about my motorcycle?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.263
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, I'm mad, too, Fonz,

12:50.403 --> 12:51.598
but you said it yourself,

12:51.738 --> 12:53.069
the kid's trying to make
some extra cash.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.230
He's a businessman.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.001
Hey, I'm gonna give him
the business.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.611
Fonz, just take it easy.
He's only 16.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.611
This thing is going
to float away.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.239
And besides, the way I saw him
running out of Arnold's,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.147
I don't think you're going
to find him for a while.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.253
I know how to find him.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.722
This is going to hurt me
more than it hurts you.

13:18.531 --> 13:22.024
Fonz, you're taking it well.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.663
(frustrated growling)

13:33.379 --> 13:35.848
Let's go and get him.

Al, Al,
I don't want you to get hurt,

15:12.311 --> 15:13.369
I don't want you
to get hurt, Al,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.447
but you hit a few clinkers
in that one.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.913
Aw, Rich, well,
I was worried about Chachi.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.950
- I know.
-ls the set over?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.645
- Yeah, yeah, take five.
- All right, okay.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.620
The doctor told me
not to worry about anything,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.747
and I'm not going
to worry about anything.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.451
(sighs)

15:27.593 --> 15:30.290
You know, don't you?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.456
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.533
Pots, is your hair back
to normal yet?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.659
Oh, it's better.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.045
The first time in your life
you're even funnier than Ralph.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.249
So, uh, is Chachi here?

15:54.387 --> 15:55.286
Couldn't find him, huh?

15:55.421 --> 15:56.650
I didn't think you'd be able to.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.814
I know his weakness--
he'll be here.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.189
Four, three, two, one.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.386
(Snap fingers)

16:03.529 --> 16:04.792
- Oh, I love papaya.
-(rhythmic rattling)

16:04.931 --> 16:06.626
I love pineapple,
all that South Seas stuff.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.564
Now, look,
why don't you and me...

16:11.971 --> 16:13.632
This is an ambush, huh?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.043
Does this mean the luau's off?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.974
-(snaps fingers) -All right,
in my office, right now.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.375
Eh... boy.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.879
What are you complaining about?

16:23.015 --> 16:24.380
It looks terrific.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.647
Fonz, are you sure
that you want to...

16:29.789 --> 16:30.813
- You, too.
- Me?

16:30.957 --> 16:33.790
- Yeah.
- Ah.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.394
Fonz...

16:35.528 --> 16:36.620
Put your hat back on.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.696
Right, right.

16:39.899 --> 16:43.062
Hey, uh, I forgot what brunch
was on Sunday.

16:43.202 --> 16:46.001
(rattling)

16:46.138 --> 16:48.971
Thanks a lot.
I'll be there.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.099
Hey, I'm sorry, Judy,
I can't make it right now.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.406
I have a very important meeting
in my office.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.412
He'll call you back.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.846
And second of all,
this is my office.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.681
So, the killer of motorcycle
seats returns.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.219
How did I know the wax was bad?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.481
All right, let's sit down
and talk this out.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.988
Watch it, Richie, huh?

17:05.124 --> 17:07.183
All you're interested in doing
is making extra bucks, huh?

17:07.326 --> 17:08.487
That's right. You were the one
who told me

17:08.627 --> 17:09.857
to go out and earn
some extra money, right?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.828
- We'll stand up and talk.
- Richie, please, huh?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.329
I told you to earn
some extra money.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.434
I didn't tell you to ruin
Milwaukee in the process.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.468
I'm so inadequate when it comes
to confrontations.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.968
Richie, will you please.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.267
You know, I asked you for help,
but what'd you give me?

17:21.406 --> 17:23.603
Advice. Big deal.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.233
You know what I'm gonna do
from now on?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.368
Tell me.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.527
Fonz, everybody hates me.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.894
I need help.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.333
The kid needs help.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.236
What are you yelling
at him for, Rich?

17:56.275 --> 17:57.902
No, but, Fonz, I was the one...

17:58.044 --> 17:59.170
Hey, Richie,
I'll ask you a question.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.370
You remember when you were
16 years old?

18:00.513 --> 18:01.571
A little sensitivity, here.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.113
Yeah, uh, right, Fonz.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.275
All right, I'm such a sucker
when he gets humble.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.046
What happened?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.450
I don't know.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.580
Some shady looking guy said
I could make some big money.

18:11.724 --> 18:12.850
And then he dumps this wax

18:12.992 --> 18:14.482
that eats favorite things
on you, huh?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.026
You know what that
sounds like to me?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.290
- Richie, please.
- Then why am I here?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.628
- You're setting a good example.
- Ah...

18:21.767 --> 18:24.566
All right, now,
this is a typical con game.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.001
What's the guy's name?

18:26.138 --> 18:27.299
Uh, Becket.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.464
-(snaps fingers)
- Remember that.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.133
All right now,
he hustles kids, right?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.835
Dumps useless wax on them

18:31.978 --> 18:34.106
and then takes the money
and skedaddles.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.611
Not nice.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.978
See that?
What a lovely example.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.744
Fonz, what am I going to do?

18:39.885 --> 18:40.852
All right, you're gonna sit
right down here,

18:40.987 --> 18:42.716
take a load off your feet,

18:42.855 --> 18:44.584
don't slip into the sink.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.850
(Snaps fingers)

18:45.992 --> 18:47.790
- This con-er...
- Mm-hmm.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.361
...is going to become
our con-ee, huh?

18:49.495 --> 18:51.486
Here's what we're gonna do.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.862
So, what makes you think
this Becket guy

18:59.005 --> 19:00.097
is really going to show up?

19:00.239 --> 19:01.729
Greed, Red, greed.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.273
They're ain't enough money in
the world for guys like that.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.844
He thinks he's taking us
as easy marks, huh.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.912
Fonz, Fonz,
Becket just drove up.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.242
-(snaps fingers)
- All right, disappear.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.975
- Where? Where?
- My office. My office.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.643
Hurry. Hurry.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.754
Okay, okay, we're ready to go.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.980
(clears throat)

19:17.123 --> 19:19.751
Well, we're in...
we're in good now.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.417
All we gotta do is lay our hands
on that wax,

19:21.560 --> 19:23.426
then we close the deal
and we got ourselves

19:23.562 --> 19:24.893
half a million bucks.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.898
What about that sharpie,
you know, Mr. Becket?

19:28.034 --> 19:30.162
RICHIE: Oh, Beckefs a boob,
he won't know anything.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.497
The boob knows.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.129
Uh-oh. I think he heard.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.765
You're-you're, uh, Becket?

19:36.909 --> 19:38.138
You've got it.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.211
What's the scam
on a half a million?

19:40.346 --> 19:41.745
Half a million dollars?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.110
I never said anything
about a half a mill...

19:43.249 --> 19:44.444
Did you ever say anything
about a half a million?

19:44.583 --> 19:46.176
No. I can't even wrap my tongue
around those words.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.444
All right, stop the double-talk.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.146
You two got something big going
with my wax,

19:50.289 --> 19:52.314
and I want to know what it is.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.857
- All right, he's-he's got us,
Fonzarelli. -Yeah.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.257
Without his wax,
why, there's no deal.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.830
- I feel like a rat in a trap.
- Yeah.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.591
(rhythmic drumbeat, rattling)

20:00.733 --> 20:02.633
-(snaps fingers)
- Not now.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.870
Uh, you know,
the neighborhood's changing.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.103
Cut the clowning.
Now, what's the deal?

20:12.244 --> 20:14.269
Uh, I don't like violence, sir.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.643
All right, all right,
a kid sold us

20:16.782 --> 20:18.443
some of your lncredo-Wax, see,
and then, uh,

20:18.584 --> 20:20.211
and then my partner, Fonzie,
mixed it with something else,

20:20.352 --> 20:21.717
-another ingredient...
- BECKET: And-and what?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.049
- What, what?
- Well, it changed.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.179
Well, what did it change to?

20:24.323 --> 20:25.722
Well, show him, show him, Red.

20:25.858 --> 20:26.916
- Yeah, show me, come on.
- Yeah. All right.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.925
- I want to see this.
- Show him.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.654
- Ready, Fonzarelli?
- All right. Yeah, yeah.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.062
(metallic clang,
Fonzie grunts quietly)

20:33.199 --> 20:34.963
Hmm?

20:35.101 --> 20:36.694
Now, two hours ago,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.737
this was a flimsy piece
of cheap leather.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.933
And...
No, no, it was good leather.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.601
See, and then
we rubbed the wax on it.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.180
Yeah, and it became hard
as steel.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.543
(metallic clang)

20:49.682 --> 20:52.208
You two seem to have something
pretty good going here.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.080
I want in.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.847
All right.
Okay, how about this?

20:55.988 --> 20:58.150
- We'll cut you in for a third.
- Third.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.122
- I want half.
- Oh, man.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.658
- Unbelievable, unbelievable.
- Oh.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.262
All right, okay, we're going
to have to talk this over.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.726
- Talk it over. Make it quick.
- Okay.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.888
All right,
we're talking it over here.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.092
Look at us.
Here we are talking it over.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.267
Fonz, is your chest all right?

21:12.404 --> 21:14.566
Yeah, I think you bent my
favorite hubcap though.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.505
- Come on, snap it up,
snap it up. -(snapping fingers)

21:16.642 --> 21:18.736
- All right. -Meek is killing me,
you know that.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.004
I understand.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.477
BECKET: Snap it up.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.207
All right, all right.
We talked it over.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.647
We don't like it,
but you're in for half.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.617
- Whoa.
- That's fabulous.

21:27.753 --> 21:31.485
Now, partners, who's putting up
the half a million?

21:31.624 --> 21:32.648
Foreign interests.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.816
I don't like it.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.586
He pays it all in cash.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.526
-(ahooga horn blows)
- That's better.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.893
-(car door opens)
- There's his foreign car now.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.694
-(car door closes)
- Don't blow this deal.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.997
Ah...

21:48.274 --> 21:50.766
Greetings from the desert.

21:52.111 --> 21:56.207
May your camel always
stand upwind.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.544
YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP-

21:59.518 --> 22:00.883
Who is this infidel?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.545
Oh, no, we're very honored

22:02.688 --> 22:04.713
to have the inventor
of lncredo-Wax with us.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.757
Do you have the money?

22:06.892 --> 22:07.984
(Al laughs)

22:08.127 --> 22:09.822
Foreign suitcase.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.124
Yankee dollars.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.130
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.791
First demonstration.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.960
- Oh, right, we promised
a demonstration. -Yeah.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.537
Hey, uh, put it on the car.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.696
I don't think
you should do that.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.239
Well, it'll make it dent-proof,
you know.

22:22.374 --> 22:23.671
Well, no, I'm not so sure now.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.301
Hey, I know what I'm doing.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.243
Yeah, hey, whatever you want,
whatever you want.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.745
Here, some lncredo-Wax.

22:29.882 --> 22:30.974
There you go.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.448
- You'll love the demonstration.
-(Al laughs)

22:33.586 --> 22:36.783
If this works,
my camels will be invincible.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.590
Here, that ought to be hard
enough now.

22:42.728 --> 22:46.096
You, hood,
hand me a sledgehammer.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.800
Your Sheikhness, dig this.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.670
(loud clanging)

22:59.245 --> 23:00.440
Maybe the fender'll be harder.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.910
I can try the fender.
Watch this.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.481
This is going to be good
for you.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.607
(loud clanging)

23:12.625 --> 23:14.115
Wait, wait, wait.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.989
No, no, no, no.
No handcuffs.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.825
Give me his hands.
Give me his hands.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.606
Hooray, we did it.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.408
AL, FONZIE & RICHIE:
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.417
Boy, I worked out
a terrific deal with Al.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.218
I work for seven weeks
as a busboy

23:47.359 --> 23:49.293
and that pays
for the whole table.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.556
- That's great.
- See you, Fonz.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.961
- Yeah.
- Uh...

23:54.099 --> 23:56.397
- Fonz?
- Yeah?

23:56.535 --> 23:59.300
You know...

23:59.438 --> 24:02.305
sometimes a guy gets himself
in a real mess

24:02.441 --> 24:05.240
and another guy
helps him out of it,

24:05.377 --> 24:06.845
and for some reason,

24:06.979 --> 24:09.141
the first guy doesn't know how
to tell the second guy

24:09.281 --> 24:11.613
how he feels
and how he appreciates

24:11.750 --> 24:14.742
what the second guy
did for the first guy.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.377
Chach, forget all these guys.

24:16.522 --> 24:20.857
You want to say thank you,
you say, "Thank you."

24:20.993 --> 24:22.757
Thank you, Fonz.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.865
What do you think
cousins are for?

24:25.998 --> 24:27.864
See you later.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.162
- Hi, Rich.
- Hey, Chach.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.397
Fonz, did you have a talk
with Chachi?

24:33.539 --> 24:36.133
Yeah, yeah, I did.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.470
You know,
I'll tell you something.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.579
He-he reminds me so much of me
when I was his age.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.010
Oh. yeah?

24:42.147 --> 24:44.980
Okay, Judy, now we only have
20 minutes to get to the luau.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.108
All you have to do is wiggle.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.913
Okay, can you wigg...
Terrific.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.283
That's perfect.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.891
Fonz, he is just like you.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.459
