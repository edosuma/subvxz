Mmm.

00:20.978 --> 00:23.970
Jeremy, what are you doing?

00:24.018 --> 00:27.409
It's Toni. She's rummaging.
I'm watching her rummage.

00:29.979 --> 00:31.571
God, do you know what? I think I love her.

00:31.619 --> 00:34.418
You love her? What do you love about her?

00:34.460 --> 00:37.293
Mmm... everything.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.971
Her... vibe.
Oh, God, why does the world have to be so wrong?

00:42.021 --> 00:45.412
Come on, Jez! You don't love her.
You're just jealous cos her husband's back.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.738
There's only so much happiness in the world
and they're hoarding it all.

00:48.782 --> 00:52.093
- That's not how happiness works.
- 'It completely is.'

00:52.143 --> 00:55.852
Yeah, what would you know
about love or happiness?

00:57.544 --> 01:02.937

I know you have to play dirty, my friend.

A proper chat. Really get down to it.'

this department needs a kick up the
arse so hard my foot'll go up your digestive tract

Hey, Mark! How's it hanging?

01:48.552 --> 01:50.304
OK, thanks.

01:50.352 --> 01:54.505
Sophie, I was wondering...
I was hoping that we could have a chat.

01:54.553 --> 01:55.906
A proper chat.

01:55.953 --> 01:57.545
Oh. Yeah.

01:58.514 --> 02:01.153
Yeah. So...

02:03.954 --> 02:08.152

what was the name of your first childhood pet?

02:12.836 --> 02:15.396
Oh, Jeremy and I were having a bet.

02:15.436 --> 02:19.191
Only wine gums,
but it makes the evenings go a bit quicker.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.307
Oh. So, did you want to dance?

02:21.357 --> 02:23.588
I can't, really, it's not...

02:23.638 --> 02:24.991
Hi, Soph. You dancing?

02:25.038 --> 02:26.517
Oh, you betcha!

Hey, Soph!

03:17.807 --> 03:20.560
Hey, Mark!
So, you wanted to have a big chat and everything?

03:20.607 --> 03:22.484
Yeah, we could do, but then,

03:22.527 --> 03:27.044
why be so serious and uptight all the time?
We should relax, do matey things, yeah?

03:27.088 --> 03:27.998
Absolutely.

03:28.048 --> 03:32.167
Like... a movie. A movie on a wet Saturday.

03:32.209 --> 03:33.608
That's what mates do, right?

03:33.649 --> 03:38.041
Sure. Or what about a dance class? If you think
you can face it you can come to my dance class!

03:38.090 --> 03:41.640
Dancing? Yes, dancing, I love dancing.

Jeremy, would you like some biscotti?

03:55.893 --> 03:58.407
Er... sure.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.491
I'll get them.

04:06.535 --> 04:09.845

Brand New Heavies are releasing a new album.

04:09.895 --> 04:14.651
Toni, I love you.
I can't hold it in, I absolutely fucking love you.

04:14.696 --> 04:17.164
Jeremy, what are you... Really?

04:19.937 --> 04:22.246
I was just telling Jeremy
about the Brand New Heavies' new album.

04:22.297 --> 04:26.610
Yeah. That's something to look forward to, isn't it?

04:26.658 --> 04:29.570
I'd like a ginger nut, if there are any.

04:30.579 --> 04:32.934
Yeah, I think there are some.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.853
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.936
Jeremy...

04:39.980 --> 04:42.654
God, you're so... I mean...

04:44.741 --> 04:50.180
- What's going on?
- Tony... Jeremy loves me.

04:50.222 --> 04:53.419
Um, no, I didn't actually...

04:53.462 --> 04:58.378
Of course you do.
You're a moth, sucked in by the light.

04:58.423 --> 05:03.418
I've been banging my head for 15 years
against that beautiful light bulb

This is the best thing for you, mate.
Take your mind off it.

05:28.668 --> 05:33.299
Maybe I should send her a bit of ear. Or a finger.
Just to show I'm really serious.

05:33.349 --> 05:36.945
Hi, guys! There's a changing room round there
if you want to...

05:36.990 --> 05:41.745
Um, I thought these would be...
This is salsa, isn't it?

05:41.790 --> 05:45.750
No. Oh, no, salsa's on Tuesdays.
This is Rainbow Rhythms.

05:45.791 --> 05:48.669
It's quite full-on.
Mark, are you all right with that?

05:48.711 --> 05:50.464
Me?

05:52.312 --> 05:55.146

'He's probably here for community service.

'He looks like he's actually getting a bonk on.

06:35.119 --> 06:37.759
'I'm definitely king of the hippy jungle.'

06:37.800 --> 06:40.109
Take a partner.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.360
And with that partner,
let the music take you into your primal self.

Look, can you please just get out of my way?

07:15.446 --> 07:17.118
Thank you.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.599
Hey, Soph!

07:18.646 --> 07:20.285
I came with her.

07:20.327 --> 07:24.479
- It's really hot! Fancy ducking out for a while?
- We're right in the middle.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.562
He-hey!

07:25.607 --> 07:28.964
'Is this it?
Is this what my granddad died for?

07:29.008 --> 07:32.080
'The freedom to do this? Jesus! '

07:33.329 --> 07:36.924
So, how did we all experience the class?

07:38.650 --> 07:40.606
Well, um...

07:40.650 --> 07:45.600
I felt a lot of stuff to do with rejection
coming up for me tonight.

07:45.651 --> 07:47.960
Um, I was dancing with someone

07:48.011 --> 07:51.971
and they made it very clear
that they didn't want to be with me.

07:52.012 --> 07:55.561
Er, and it just...
brought up a lot of feelings.

07:56.613 --> 07:58.808
That's all. Thanks.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.642
Yeah, there was a lot of new energy
in the room tonight

08:02.694 --> 08:05.606
and some of it was just so Rainbow Rhythms,

08:05.654 --> 08:10.729
<i>and some of it was just
so not Rainbow Rhythms. Thanks.</i>

08:10.775 --> 08:15.531
Why don't you just say who you're talking about?
You're talking about me, aren't you?

08:15.576 --> 08:17.646
Well, yes, all right, I am.

08:17.696 --> 08:21.326
Well, listen. I'm sorry if I didn't do it right

08:21.377 --> 08:23.732
and I'm sorry if you assume

08:23.777 --> 08:27.134
that I eat red meat and don't necessarily think

08:27.178 --> 08:29.976
money or Tony Blair are a bad thing,

08:30.018 --> 08:32.168
but if there isn't room here

08:32.217 --> 08:35.972
for people who stand
against everything you believe in,

08:36.019 --> 08:38.533
then what sort of a hippy free-for-all is this?

08:43.380 --> 08:45.292
'I can't believe yesterday morning

08:54.662 --> 08:58.451
Oh, Jesus, thank you for this experience!

08:58.503 --> 09:01.063
Yeah... Thanks, Jesus.

09:01.103 --> 09:04.335
OK, now... stop.

09:04.384 --> 09:06.102
What?

09:06.144 --> 09:09.136
Don't... move a muscle.

- Go... away!

09:32.868 --> 09:37.420
No, Jez. Look, we've discussed this.
Early in morning counts as late at night

09:37.469 --> 09:39.699
and we agreed no reggae music late at night, so...

09:39.749 --> 09:41.945
What?

09:41.990 --> 09:46.382
Oh, for God's sake, Jeremy.
I can't talk to you with... that.

09:46.431 --> 09:49.468
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
we've both got one, haven't we?

09:50.031 --> 09:53.388
Look, Jez, can you please just keep it quiet?

09:53.432 --> 09:55.707
Some of us have jobs to go to.

09:55.752 --> 09:59.268
Mark, your job is going to the office.
My job is having sex.

09:59.313 --> 10:03.272
Yeah? That's what I do now.
That's what I am. I'm a sexer. OK?

10:03.313 --> 10:05.703
Sorry, Mark, did we wake you?

10:05.754 --> 10:08.314
We were both coming so hard
we didn't notice the volume.

10:08.354 --> 10:11.347
An explanation. Finally.

10:11.395 --> 10:13.704
Thank you, Nancy.

10:13.755 --> 10:16.270
Thanks for the explanation.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.987
'OK, so, dance class.

10:21.196 --> 10:25.713
'Ali-kazoo, ali-kazam,
let's find out just how fucked I am.

10:26.597 --> 10:31.718
'OK, here we go. "And last night
Mark was a bit weird." Fair comment.

10:31.758 --> 10:35.115
"'He didn't really get it." What's to get?

10:35.159 --> 10:38.231
"'But, shit! He came,
so that was pretty amazing." OK!

10:38.279 --> 10:41.511
"'Had dinner with Jeff later." Ooh, naughty.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.120
"'Gave him a kiss, but not sure.
He can be so pushy."

10:44.160 --> 10:49.838
'He kissed her?! I've got to make a move!
Maybe I should try tapping her phone.'

10:51.281 --> 10:54.433
'Hope they're not doing it in the hall.

10:54.482 --> 10:57.076
'There's nothing erotic about a hall, is there? '

10:57.122 --> 11:00.593
Hello? I'm coming in now!
This is me coming into my house!

11:00.643 --> 11:04.352
- Hi, Mark.
- All right, Jez. Is Nancy around?

11:04.403 --> 11:08.158
- Just gone. I'm seeing her down the Rhythms.
- Right, OK.

11:09.324 --> 11:11.919
Jez, why's the chair? And...

11:11.965 --> 11:14.081
what's all this strawberry?

11:14.125 --> 11:18.756
And... my... yogurt?
Jez, what's happened to my Muller?

11:18.806 --> 11:24.279
Oh, no, you haven't, have you? You haven't
been sexing it up in here with my yogurt?

11:24.327 --> 11:28.036
Relax, Mark, it's all right.
We were just feeling very... horny.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.842
I don't want to know! OK?
I don't want to hear about it!

11:31.888 --> 11:36.724
And I don't want it using up all my yogurt
and... bloody... shower gel?!

11:36.769 --> 11:40.603
Mark, I'm just in a very erotic
relationship right now. I mean,

11:40.649 --> 11:44.359
we're systematically breaking down
all of society's taboos.

11:44.410 --> 11:50.168
Right. And love? Romance?
I mean, is there any romance in any of this at all?

11:50.211 --> 11:52.327
Who needs romance
when you're doing it up the bum?

11:52.371 --> 11:55.330
Exactly. Exactly my point.

11:55.372 --> 11:57.761
I mean, if you've actually done... that,

11:57.812 --> 12:01.169
which, by the way,
I can see no point whatsoever in myself...

12:01.213 --> 12:04.523
- You'd love to try it.
- I honestly would not!

12:04.573 --> 12:08.169
What is this modern obsession with... that?

12:08.214 --> 12:10.682
Look, Jez, what I'm trying to say is,

12:10.734 --> 12:14.444
so, for better, for worse, the '60s happened,

12:14.495 --> 12:16.929
and now sex is fine.

12:16.975 --> 12:19.536
But can't we take the best of that,

12:19.576 --> 12:23.934
the nice music, the colours,
the "I have a dream", etc,

12:23.977 --> 12:27.572
but not have to face the... squalor?

12:27.617 --> 12:30.257
Er, you might want to give that

12:30.298 --> 12:32.812
a bit of a rinse, actually, mate.

12:34.178 --> 12:36.409
Do I really have to do this?

12:36.459 --> 12:38.927
What are you afraid of, Jeremy?

12:40.419 --> 12:41.613
All done.

12:41.659 --> 12:45.858
I dunno, it just feels almost... wrong.

12:45.900 --> 12:51.658
We're breaking a taboo, of course it feels wrong.
We've got boundaries to smash, Jeremy.

12:51.701 --> 12:55.775
It's our duty to God, Shiva, NASDAQ,
whatever you wanna call him.

12:55.822 --> 12:59.212
But are you sure this isn't... racist?

12:59.262 --> 13:04.018
Jeremy, I come from America.
I've seen the problems race brings up.

13:05.783 --> 13:07.979
Now fuck me and pretend I'm your mom!

13:08.024 --> 13:10.219
What? Why?

13:10.264 --> 13:15.100
You can't imagine your mom having sex
with a black man? That's pretty racist, Jeremy.

13:15.145 --> 13:17.818
It's not that, it's just... Mum?

13:17.865 --> 13:20.300
Really?

13:20.346 --> 13:23.782
Mummy? I... I'm sorry, Nancy, I can't do it.

13:23.826 --> 13:26.421
I'm not... getting anything.

13:26.467 --> 13:28.742
I'm sorry. I just can't.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.139
'I wonder which of my treasured
possessions

13:48.190 --> 13:49.988
'they'll be putting in each other's anuses tonight? '

13:50.031 --> 13:52.306
'God, she's amazing.

13:52.351 --> 13:56.345
'Got to keep her interested.
Prove I can breaking taboos. But what?

13:56.392 --> 13:58.701
'Take a crap on the floor? No.'

13:58.752 --> 14:01.027
Hi, honey, I managed to make it!

14:01.073 --> 14:03.268
Oh. Brilliant.

14:03.473 --> 14:06.783
Tony and I talked it all through,
the whole horrible situation.

14:06.833 --> 14:10.349
- What situation?
- You being in love with me!

14:10.394 --> 14:12.908
Oh, right. Yeah.

14:14.355 --> 14:16.550
Now, as we flow into yellow,

14:16.595 --> 14:19.268
remember, stop thinking.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.876
<i>Let your body dance you.</i>

14:21.916 --> 14:25.306
'Next she'll be telling us to use the Force.

14:25.356 --> 14:30.875
'lf you ask me, Skywalker was bloody lucky
to get away with turning off his guidance system.

14:30.917 --> 14:35.946
'No, to act relaxed,
it'll take all my cunning, skill and concentration.'

14:37.919 --> 14:42.549
'Shit! Who's Mr New Pants?
Fuck, he's crossing a boundary.

14:42.599 --> 14:45.831
'Bollocks, why do we come somewhere
with no boundaries?

14:45.880 --> 14:47.677
'This would never happen at the pub'

14:47.720 --> 14:52.351
Now, as we move into red,
let it all go, my super-luminaries.

14:52.401 --> 14:54.756
Open the box.

14:54.801 --> 14:58.761
'Yeah, sure, honey.
Appear to be opening the box

14:58.802 --> 15:02.512
'while, in fact, the lid stays very firmly on.'

15:09.044 --> 15:12.480
'She's buying it! God, it's so easy being a freak!

15:12.524 --> 15:14.755
'No wonder they're ten a penny.

15:14.805 --> 15:17.956
'I should get extra marks
for not feeling a fucking thing.'

15:24.726 --> 15:26.922
Mark, how are you feeling?

15:26.967 --> 15:29.845
You looked like you really
got in touch with something in there.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.400
'Oh, for God's sake! '

15:31.447 --> 15:34.042
Yeah, well, it wasn't really me as such,

15:34.088 --> 15:36.841
it was almost as if
something was flowing out of me.

15:36.888 --> 15:40.120
Mmm, that literally happened to me
the first time I went.

15:40.169 --> 15:42.524
- I opened up so much I puked.
- Blimey.

15:42.569 --> 15:45.038
I think that's fantastic.

15:45.090 --> 15:50.005
No, brilliant. I mean, that's brilliant, honey.
You're such a bloody trooper.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.680
That's when I decided to live in the open 24/7.
No more crap...

15:53.731 --> 15:55.847
crap sex, crap relationships.

15:55.891 --> 15:57.007
Absolutely, sweetheart.

15:57.052 --> 16:02.001
I mean, we have a great time together and
obviously we both know it's an open relationship.

16:02.052 --> 16:03.725
Exactly. We're open in our relationship.

16:03.773 --> 16:05.604
And we're open with other people.

16:05.653 --> 16:08.247
We... are?

16:08.293 --> 16:10.285
That's what we're all about, right, Jez? Freedom.

16:10.334 --> 16:14.965
Sure, Nance, sure, yeah.
Freedom, loyalty, commitment, monogamy.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.971
In a sense, that's the final taboo, isn't it?

16:17.015 --> 16:21.806
That's funny, you weren't worried about monogamy
the other day when you told me you loved me.

16:23.336 --> 16:25.486
Right, yeah. I mean,

16:25.536 --> 16:28.131
that was a bit of a... Not mistake,

16:28.177 --> 16:31.965
or joke, but... just wrong.

16:32.017 --> 16:34.373
I mean, you can't love two people at once.

16:34.418 --> 16:35.533
Yes, you can.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.534
Of course you can.

16:37.578 --> 16:41.094
No, sure, obviously you can, but you don't.

16:41.139 --> 16:45.770
You work out who you like best
and then pretend not to like anyone else.

16:45.820 --> 16:50.974
What do you think, Soph?
Can you love more than one person at a time?

16:51.020 --> 16:55.651
Well, um, I mean,
it depends what type of love you're talking about.

16:55.701 --> 17:00.139
'Yeah, but what does she really think?
Probably shouldn't look again today.

17:00.182 --> 17:02.650
'More than once every four hours
would be obsessive.'

17:02.702 --> 17:03.658
very confusing.

17:03.703 --> 17:05.739
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

17:05.782 --> 17:09.059
Tell you what, I'm off to the bog. For a wee!

17:10.983 --> 17:15.454
'Conversation is rubbish.
You could waste years talking to someone

17:15.505 --> 17:19.417
and never get the bottom line.
OK. Still nothing interesting in the outbox.

17:19.464 --> 17:24.665
'She needs to express her feelings more.
Ha! Just, check the inbox.

17:24.705 --> 17:28.336
'A-ha! Jeff. Just arrived. What's your game?

17:28.387 --> 17:32.062
"'Soph, just a thought,
d'you fancy going punting on Saturday?

17:32.107 --> 17:35.783
"'Thought it might be a laugh. Bell me.
Love, Jeffy."

17:35.828 --> 17:39.868
'Jeffy. Eugh. Punting? Punting equals shunting.

17:39.909 --> 17:44.187
'Got to get in first, ask her out on a day trip.
What's a banker? '

17:44.229 --> 17:47.859
And we'd be exploring the miracles of flight
and human endeavour.

17:47.910 --> 17:50.185
It's a spiritual thing, really.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.699
Mark, we are not going to RAF Duxford.

17:52.751 --> 17:55.470
And I'm sorry, but we did vote,
so the stone circle it is.

17:55.511 --> 17:58.310
Yes. Yes, I know.

17:58.352 --> 18:02.630
Well, it'll be good to go to a field
and... look at some stones.

18:02.672 --> 18:06.268
Shit. We've gone into the crease.
I can't make out anything in the crease.

18:06.313 --> 18:11.308
Jez, we've been lost for four hours now.
Fuck it, I'm going to Tollesbury.

18:11.354 --> 18:12.025
Tollesbury?

18:12.074 --> 18:16.226
Yeah. We can surprise Gwyn from dance class.
He's got a boathouse there.

18:16.275 --> 18:18.266
Right, Gwyn. Brilliant.

18:18.315 --> 18:21.944
'Shit. Got to stop this.
Grab the wheel. Cause an accident.

18:21.995 --> 18:25.352
'There's definitely a taboo against that.
Plus, if she got disfigured,

18:25.396 --> 18:27.387
'she'd be more likely to stick with me.

18:27.436 --> 18:32.557
'But what if I came off worse, lost a limb?
I'm punching above my weight as it is.'

18:32.597 --> 18:34.828
Or, listen, if we take a right up ahead,

18:34.878 --> 18:39.633
we could make it to this really
wicked-looking public weighbridge!

18:41.319 --> 18:44.152
This is great.
So great to see you guys down here.

18:44.199 --> 18:48.034
This place is just fantastic, Gwyn.
Isn't it fantastic?

18:48.080 --> 18:49.479
- Amazing.
- Brilliant.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.641
- Yeah. We should think about heading off.
- Nonsense. You're here, enjoy.

18:55.681 --> 18:57.956
Hey, I tell you what.

18:58.001 --> 19:00.357
Let's all take a swim.

19:00.402 --> 19:04.111
Nice idea but no... stuff. So we'd better be off.

19:04.162 --> 19:08.600
On a day like this, what stuff do you need?
"Sorry, I can't possibly enjoy

19:08.643 --> 19:12.159
"the fresh water against my skin,
I haven't got my stuff."

19:12.204 --> 19:14.798
All right, I don't need stuff, either.

19:14.844 --> 19:17.040
Forget stuff. Let's have it.

19:18.925 --> 19:23.556
Is there no stuff I can borrow?
I really do feel much more comfortable with stuff.

19:24.686 --> 19:27.439
Oh, this is amazing! I love this!

19:27.486 --> 19:29.603
Come on, Mark!

19:29.647 --> 19:31.842
Get the pants off, dude, and come on in!

19:31.887 --> 19:33.878
I might keep them on, actually.

19:33.927 --> 19:37.045
Don't be a party pooper, get 'em off!

19:37.088 --> 19:38.840
Yeah! Come on!

19:38.888 --> 19:40.958
'No way. No fucking way.'

19:41.008 --> 19:44.638
I'm not sure I want to swim, actually.
I might just watch.

19:44.689 --> 19:45.838
Off! Off! Off!

19:45.889 --> 19:47.881
Off! Off! Off!

19:47.930 --> 19:50.524
We've all got 'em off, get 'em off!
We're having fun!

19:50.570 --> 19:52.845
Jez! Seriously, don't!

19:52.890 --> 19:54.404
I'm pulling your pants down, Mark!

19:54.451 --> 19:57.045
Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off me!

19:58.091 --> 20:00.731
I'll do it. All right? I'll do it.

20:00.772 --> 20:03.206
In my own time, I'll do it.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.845
Yes!

20:20.335 --> 20:24.568
'OK, done the hard part,
they've seen and rated my penis,

20:24.616 --> 20:29.167
'now it's time to take advantage of the '60s vibe
to get it on with Sophie.'

20:29.216 --> 20:31.367
This place is amazing, Gwyn.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.647
How can you afford it all?

20:33.697 --> 20:35.176
I guess I've just been very lucky.

20:35.217 --> 20:39.609
Money's an energy
and lots of it has always flowed towards me,

20:39.658 --> 20:41.614
particularly after my parents died.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.808
Cosmic.

20:42.859 --> 20:46.534
Yeah. Well, that might sound funny to you,
but it was actually quite a painful time.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.255
I just meant... 'You're not gonna
out-hippy me, you fucking hippy.'

20:50.300 --> 20:52.609
this place has great energy.

20:52.660 --> 20:56.939
Yeah.
I remember when I first spent time down here.

20:56.981 --> 21:00.611
I was 14 years old
and I came down here all alone,

21:00.662 --> 21:04.211
just with a candle
and an old, old copy of Henry Miller.

21:04.262 --> 21:07.255
And I just had the most amazing wank.

21:08.263 --> 21:10.572
It really just bust me open.

21:10.623 --> 21:14.902
I couldn't believe that I had
this... instrument right there.

21:14.944 --> 21:18.061
Isn't it amazing, that first big wank?

21:18.104 --> 21:20.221
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

21:22.265 --> 21:26.896
I tell you what we used to do down here
when we were kids. Spin the bottle,

21:26.946 --> 21:29.062
that old thing!

21:29.106 --> 21:31.575
Hey. Why not?

21:32.627 --> 21:34.743
Why don't we just fucking go for it?

21:34.787 --> 21:36.345
Yeah!

21:37.508 --> 21:41.979
OK, so, whoever's on kisses
whoever the bottle stops at. Cool?

21:42.028 --> 21:43.940
Yeah. Mark?

21:43.989 --> 21:46.059
'Say no. Ask her to go for a walk.'

21:46.109 --> 21:48.418
Sure, yeah.

21:48.469 --> 21:51.860
OK, so, Jez, you're on. And it's...

21:51.910 --> 21:53.707
'Nancy. Nancy. Nancy.'

21:53.750 --> 21:55.230
Mark.

21:55.271 --> 21:58.468
OK, so, what happens? Spin again?

21:58.511 --> 22:01.345
Sure. If you can't handle it, spin again.

22:01.392 --> 22:04.464
Oh, I can handle it.

22:04.512 --> 22:07.391
I just wasn't sure about... Mark...

22:07.433 --> 22:10.630
where you stand on... taboos.

22:10.673 --> 22:12.709
'I'm not uptight. I'm not uptight! '

22:12.753 --> 22:15.222
I... hate taboos.

22:15.274 --> 22:17.230
Well, me too.

22:17.274 --> 22:18.912
I break them.

22:18.954 --> 22:22.072
Me too, I... love breaking them.

22:23.195 --> 22:26.074
'Oh, no! No! No!

22:29.356 --> 22:31.552
'I can't believe this is happening.
He doesn't even floss.

22:31.597 --> 22:35.385
'I tell him, but he won't. Jesus, when can we
stop? '

22:35.437 --> 22:37.747
'Don't stop first.
If I don't mind looking gay,

22:37.798 --> 22:40.676
'I'll seem the most hetero. At least it's Mark.

22:41.758 --> 22:44.478
'Oh, Jesus, it's Mark! '

22:45.919 --> 22:48.638
Wow, Mark!

22:50.280 --> 22:52.430
Well done.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.756
Thank you.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.634
OK, so, Nancy's on.

22:57.681 --> 23:01.640
'This is probably
how the Manson family started.'

23:03.882 --> 23:05.952
Come here, you.

23:13.363 --> 23:15.434
Er... hey,

23:15.484 --> 23:19.318
come on, folks,
there are other people waiting to...

23:19.884 --> 23:22.353
Hmm. OK.

23:22.405 --> 23:26.922
'The squalor. It's happening.
It's Woodstock, it's Altamont, it's My Lai.

23:26.966 --> 23:29.400
'Although, Sophie's hand on my thigh,

23:29.446 --> 23:32.245
'maybe there's a time and a place for squalor.'

23:33.527 --> 23:36.485
Sophie, your hand...

23:36.527 --> 23:39.520
Oh, look. Gwyn's feeling me up.

23:39.568 --> 23:44.084
'I'm Louis Theroux.
I'm Louis Theroux and his wry smile at the orgy.'

23:44.128 --> 23:46.438
Mark, are you into this?
Cos you don't look that into this.

23:46.489 --> 23:50.563
No, no, this is... great. I'm, I'm into this.

23:50.610 --> 23:53.522
Because I'm not sure I'm into this.

23:53.570 --> 23:55.162
You're not?

23:57.331 --> 24:00.050
Brilliant.

24:00.091 --> 24:04.051
<i>'Sure, an orgy sounds great,
but you're basically just multiplying</i>

24:04.092 --> 24:07.368
'the number of people
you won't be able to look in the eye afterwards.'

24:07.412 --> 24:10.769
It would be interesting to try
something like that one day

24:10.813 --> 24:13.407
but there would inevitably be complications.

24:13.453 --> 24:18.812
If you're into that, you probably see
the inevitable complications as part of the fun.

24:18.854 --> 24:20.253
Yeah.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.411
Isn't this beautiful?

24:22.455 --> 24:24.411
It really is.

24:29.256 --> 24:30.735
Here you go.

24:30.776 --> 24:34.133
'Yeah, you can keep your VD and your barricades

24:34.177 --> 24:36.486
'and your talking and your drugs,

24:36.537 --> 24:40.213
'I'm back to basics - moonlight, lake, cardigan.

24:40.258 --> 24:41.976
'Perfect.

24:42.018 --> 24:44.009
'I should do something romantic.

24:44.058 --> 24:46.209
'Surely I'm not about to sing? '

24:46.899 --> 24:50.289
<i>I may be right
I may be wrong</i>

24:50.339 --> 24:53.810
<i>But I'm perfectly willing to swear</i>

24:53.860 --> 24:58.412
<i>That when you turned and smiled at me</i>

24:59.381 --> 25:05.855
<i>A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square</i>

25:07.822 --> 25:11.657
'He looked like he was singing.
He couldn't have been singing.

25:15.744 --> 25:19.100
'This is good. This is like watching a porno.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.453
'Except I can't see anything,

25:21.504 --> 25:24.895
'I haven't got a hard-on and I want to cry.'

25:28.346 --> 25:32.339
'OK, this is the last time.
I've really got to stop it, at least ration it.

something special if we see more of each other."'

25:40.428 --> 25:42.896
- Henmania!
- Hey, Mark, what are you celebrating?

25:42.948 --> 25:46.066
Oh, it's just... Weren't we meeting outside?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.827
Go on, what is it? Let me see.

25:47.869 --> 25:49.461
Honestly, it's nothing.

25:49.509 --> 25:55.028
- How did you? Mark, is that my e-mail?
- No, it's not! It's just, er...

25:55.070 --> 25:56.662
'Escape! Escape! Escape! '

25:56.710 --> 25:59.350

26:01.391 --> 26:03.905
Sophie, but... Please! Don't!

26:03.951 --> 26:06.466
We have something special!

26:06.512 --> 26:10.631
Not my words, yours!
We can't throw that all away

26:10.673 --> 26:13.107
just because I... spy on you!

26:13.153 --> 26:14.711
Can we?
