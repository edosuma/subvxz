Previous/)4”

00:03.080 --> 00:04.069
If it wasna for Mac Dubh,

00:04.170 --> 00:06.741
I would no be setting foot
on that bucket of shite.

00:06.960 --> 00:07.995
Jamie.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.289
Ian!

00:10.670 --> 00:11.921
What do you do with the boys?

00:12.130 --> 00:13.711
Oh, I have my way with them.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.881
Virgins have such power inside.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.596
We have a responsibility
to change history.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.840
No!

00:21.180 --> 00:22.306
This is God's will!

00:23.730 --> 00:25.937
We must return to the ship.
Make ready to sail.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.145
Claire!

00:37.490 --> 00:39.321
You must be from the ship,
or what's left of it.

00:39.450 --> 00:40.656
Any survivors?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.456
Aye, four miles south of here.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.666
You're on the mainland.

00:43.750 --> 00:44.739
America.

02:07.370 --> 02:11.534
For centuries, humans have held
an endless fasahat/on with circles,

02:12.090 --> 02:14.502
attr/but/ng meaning
where they are found.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.259
From the eternal rotation
of the planets around the sun,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.887
to the movement of clock hands,

02:23.770 --> 02:25.510
to a simple wedding band.

02:29.230 --> 02:34.645
And 1; more than most; know full well
just how a circle can affect one’s life.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.310
0r death.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.359
Ripley!

03:03.220 --> 03:06.974
Would you allow me a moment
to bid farewell to my friend?

03:14.150 --> 03:15.560
Hayes.

03:18.530 --> 03:21.863
When they set you free near the gallows,
Fergus will create a stramash.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.031
and then you run as though
the devil himself is chasing you.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.368
Ye're aff yer heid, Mac Dubh.
Do you intend to be hanged as well?

03:29.460 --> 03:30.700
I canna let ye die.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.917
You came on this journey to aid us.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.035
Aye.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.790
And I dinna regret it.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.082
I shoulda listened to you, Mac Dubh.
I shouldna lain with that woman.

03:41.010 --> 03:43.752
Men do things drunk
they wouldna when clear-headed.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.425
I didna ken she was married

03:45.510 --> 03:47.762
till the husband came upon me
with a pitchfork.

03:47.850 --> 03:50.341
Kicked him down the stairs
only to save my own neck.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.726
Now it's with my neck that I'll pay.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.935
There's two things you might grant me.

03:59.150 --> 04:00.447
Anything.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.986
First, whisky.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.150
With any luck,

04:03.240 --> 04:04.980
I'll hardly notice
when the rope tightens.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.236
A whisky's hard to come by hereabouts,

04:07.370 --> 04:09.531
but I do have a wee bit of rum.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.450
I can always count on ye.

04:18.090 --> 04:19.330
To my soul.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.386
How about a drop
for my soul as well?

04:42.610 --> 04:43.656
To all our souls.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.230
Slinte.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.480
Slinte.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.530
What was your second request?

04:52.710 --> 04:56.248
I'd like the last face I look upon
to be that of a friend.

04:58.750 --> 04:59.990
Smiling at me.

05:06.470 --> 05:07.676
You have my word.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.168
When they release Hayes, do nothing.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.120
You have another plan, Milord?

05:43.670 --> 05:44.967
No.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.961
This is the way Hayes wants it.

06:06.780 --> 06:10.364
It had been four months
s/nce we arr/ved /n Amer/ca.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.289
We’d been making our way up
the coast when our friend Gavin Hayes,

06:15.370 --> 06:18.328
lr/l/ed a man and was sentenced to death.

06:21.170 --> 06:24.082
Jamie tried everything he could
to save Hayes,

06:24.760 --> 06:26.910
but the magistrate wou/dn ’t listen.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.009
Stop.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.519
Keep it going.

06:54.740 --> 06:55.786
Move.

07:03.340 --> 07:08.164
The said, Gavin Hayes,
feloniously and wilfully

07:08.260 --> 07:11.832
did kill and murder
against His Majesty's peace,

07:11.930 --> 07:14.672
his crown, and dignity.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.245
Next.

07:53.550 --> 07:56.178
No, no! Stupid guards!

07:56.390 --> 07:59.052
You let him die! Hayes!

07:59.810 --> 08:01.266
It's not... It's not right!

08:01.350 --> 08:03.853
They canna take him from me!

08:04.610 --> 08:06.146
I'm sorry! Hayes!

08:06.570 --> 08:08.606
Move it, boy.
Out of the way.

08:22.620 --> 08:23.746
He's getting away!

08:29.670 --> 08:31.217
Halt or I'll fire!

08:34.340 --> 08:36.547
Quickly, after him!

08:47.110 --> 08:49.647
Sing me a song

08:49.730 --> 08:52.642
Of a lass that is gone

08:53.280 --> 08:55.657
Say, could that lass

08:55.740 --> 08:57.571
Be 1'?

08:58.410 --> 09:00.446
Merry of soul

09:00.540 --> 09:03.407
She sa/led on a day

09:03.750 --> 09:05.741
Over the sea

09:05.830 --> 09:08.537
7'0 Skye

09:08.920 --> 09:11.377
[Wow and breeze

09:11.460 --> 09:13.621
Islands and seas

09:13.930 --> 09:18.253
Mountains of rain and sun

09:19.220 --> 09:21.711
All that was good

09:21.810 --> 09:24.131
All that was fair

09:24.480 --> 09:26.937
All that was me

09:27.020 --> 09:29.682
Is gone

09:29.770 --> 09:31.897
Sing me a song

09:31.980 --> 09:34.813
Of a lass that is gone

09:34.900 --> 09:37.232
Say, could that lass

09:37.320 --> 09:40.027
Be 1'?

09:40.120 --> 09:42.247
Merry of soul

09:42.330 --> 09:44.992
She sa/led on a day

09:45.250 --> 09:49.368
Over the sea

09:49.460 --> 09:55.672
7'0 Skye

10:31.340 --> 10:32.955
I spoke with the harbourmaster.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.120
The .
Campagn/a
sets sail
for home in three weeks,

10:35.210 --> 10:38.259
allowing us time to visit
my Aunt Jocasta at River Run.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.289
Fergus?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.630
Did you speak with the minister?

10:45.730 --> 10:46.765
Thieving wretch.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.478
_ He will not have
a conVIcted felon In his graveyard.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.972
Not without a good deal
of recompense for his sins.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.238
An immoral wretch as well.
He's Willing to take a bribe.

10:57.650 --> 10:58.730
Did you bring Hayes?

10:58.820 --> 11:01.311
Aye. He's in our wagon.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.406
We could bury him in the wood.

11:04.910 --> 11:05.899
No.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.617
No, Gavin wouldna care
for being alone in the woods.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.076
He was mortally scairt of spirits.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.779
D'ye recall, Mac Dubh, at Ardsmuir,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.706
how he told us
of the
tannasg
he encountered?

11:21.050 --> 11:23.098
We'll not lay him
in unconsecrated ground.

11:25.010 --> 11:28.389
We'll lay him to rest tonight
in the company of other souls.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.146
It's a good idea.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.726
I'm very tired.

11:34.230 --> 11:36.391
Might I take her up to her room to rest?

11:36.900 --> 11:39.448
Aye. Aye, we'll manage without ye.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.522
A man such as Hayes should
ne'er have met wi' such an end.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.327
Without so much as _
a proper lament sung for him.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.070
Well, he shall have a
caithns.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.327
And so,
we were off to bury our friend.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.747
Sad/y, Hayes would never
return home to Scotland.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.468
And the only way the rest
of us would make it back

13:22.550 --> 13:25.929
was to sell a gemstone we salvaged
from the wreck of the
Artemis.

13:28.010 --> 13:30.922
Lillington's dinner
certainly seems promising.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.921
And perhaps, we'll be able
to find a buyer for the gemstones there.

13:34.270 --> 13:36.898
Aye, the gems will fetch
a bonny price.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.219
Here'll do, lads.

13:44.110 --> 13:47.614
Lesley, stay here with Claire.

13:48.530 --> 13:49.576
Watch over Hayes.

13:49.990 --> 13:51.821
Ian and I will find a good place.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.281
Won't you need a headstone?

13:54.910 --> 13:56.821
Surely they'll notice a newly-dug grave.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.909
Aye, they might.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.911
I shouldn't think the minister
would trouble himself

14:00.000 --> 14:01.740
to dig him up for nothing.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.240
What do you do with the boys?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.121
I have my way with them.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.626
All right, lad?

14:43.710 --> 14:45.041
I have my way with them.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.676
Ian.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.756
What's the matter?

14:50.840 --> 14:52.216
And after that. . .

14:52.300 --> 14:53.426
The Bakra.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.050
I’ve no use for them.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.680
Ian, Ian!

14:59.770 --> 15:01.931
Ian. Ian, what is it?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.941
I didna want to summon the memories.

15:09.490 --> 15:10.855
But the grave...

15:13.950 --> 15:15.235
It reminds me.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.072
Some ghosts can only be banished

15:19.620 --> 15:21.872
by speaking their name
and foul deeds aloud.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.959
I, too, had a festering pain inside.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.837
Until I shared it with your Aunt Claire.

15:42.610 --> 15:46.432
When I was taken
to the woman you called Geillis...

15:48.110 --> 15:49.486
she was naked...

15:51.410 --> 15:52.729
in a basin of blood.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.037
She talked about bedding virgins,

15:57.410 --> 16:00.868
as plain as though she asked me
whether I had parritch for breakfast.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.629
I spoke true
and I told her I wasna chaste.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.008
That answer was not to her liking.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.379
She needed someone chaste
for her purposes.

16:19.390 --> 16:22.382
She took my hand, and upon my life,

16:22.900 --> 16:27.394
she made me come to bed and lie down.

16:29.860 --> 16:31.487
She made me do things.

16:33.110 --> 16:34.907
Unspeakable things.

16:52.550 --> 16:56.964
Have you ever lain wi' someone
when ye didna want to do it?

17:00.930 --> 17:01.919
I have.

17:08.770 --> 17:12.274
Then ye understand how it can be?

17:14.570 --> 17:16.026
How you can do it

17:16.740 --> 17:18.276
without wishing to,

17:20.040 --> 17:21.439
detesting it.

17:24.540 --> 17:27.782
And all the while, it feels...

17:30.340 --> 17:31.500
Pleasing?

17:36.930 --> 17:38.170
Well, lad...

17:43.100 --> 17:45.091
What it comes down to...

17:49.650 --> 17:51.686
What it comes down to is that your cock

17:51.780 --> 17:54.021
doesn't have a conscience, but you have.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.611
It's not your fault, lad.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.913
Ye did what ye must and survived.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.529
That's all that matters.

18:13.210 --> 18:14.837
Well, that hole is deep enough.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.789
So...

18:18.970 --> 18:22.428
Let's bring Hayes along then, huh?

18:28.020 --> 18:30.147
Lesley, let's get on with it.

18:30.230 --> 18:33.063
Gathering I ken
what another fellow needs.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.897
Life without him doesna seem right.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.617
- Christ alive!
- Where did it come from?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.736
From Hell.
May it return there at once!

18:44.580 --> 18:47.492
Not from Hell. From the gallows.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.662
My apologies
for frightening ye.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.956
Come.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.280
All right, all right.

18:55.170 --> 18:57.798
How long were you in the wagon?

18:57.880 --> 19:00.758
Since midovernoon.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.712
I crawled up there
once the frog loaded up poor old Hayes.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.175
I was keeping him company,

19:06.270 --> 19:09.012
hopin' that you'd be leaving town
and takin' me with you.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.813
Stephen Bonnet, sir.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.605
- Mr Bonnet.
-Hmm?

19:20.110 --> 19:21.737
For what crime were you condemned?

19:23.620 --> 19:28.034
Thieving, smuggling, piracy.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.615
And how many men have you killed

19:29.710 --> 19:32.076
in commission of your crimes,
Mr Bonnet?

19:32.420 --> 19:34.797
None that were not tryin'
to kill me first.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.665
Same as your friend.

19:44.890 --> 19:46.096
All right.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.226
You can go.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.186
I'll not hinder ye.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.067
Might I trouble you for conveyance?

20:02.910 --> 20:06.732
There'll be watchm_en and soldiers
out on the road tonight hunting me.

20:08.830 --> 20:10.366
to a creek with an outlet
down to the sea.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.449
From there, you'll be on your way,

20:11.540 --> 20:13.622
free of the taint of my company.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.331
I won't bother you again.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.000
You have my word.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.175
I'm begging you, sir.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.476
In the name of Gavin Hayes.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.607
He said you'd never turn
your back on a friend.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.899
For a friend of Gavin?

21:05.050 --> 21:06.256
All right.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.629
We'll take ye.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.051
Great.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.346
I'll go with you.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.687
_ Husband and wife
Will seem less SUSplCIOUS.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.265
Fine.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.180
First, we lay Hayes to rest.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.521
After we're done,
you two take the horses.

21:24.610 --> 21:25.656
Return to the tavern.

21:26.530 --> 21:28.942
We'll deliver Mr Bonnet to safety.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.655
Thank you.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.702
I'd only ask one more thing.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.577
Well, that you allow me
to help bury a friend.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.488
Halt. Make yourselves known.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.827
James Fraser and my wife, Claire Fraser.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.628
What is it that brings you out
so perilously late?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.296
A family matter.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.255
What have you in the wagon?

22:28.050 --> 22:29.381
Nothing of worth.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.091
What little we have
for our own prOVI5ion.

22:32.850 --> 22:36.263
A cut of venison, sack of oats.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.475
And a body.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.068
- A what?
- A corpse.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.480
One of the men
what was hanged this afternoon.

22:46.570 --> 22:49.482
We're taking him
for a proper burial with his kinsman.

22:50.780 --> 22:52.577
Have a look, Griswold.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.797
Yes, sir. It's a body.
Wrapped in a shroud.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.889
Take your bayonet and make sure
it's good and dead inside there.

23:12.970 --> 23:14.346
That's sacrilegious, Sergeant.

23:14.430 --> 23:15.840
Would you defile a body, sir?

23:16.640 --> 23:18.050
Get on with it.

23:18.140 --> 23:21.143
Stab it in the leg, Griswold,
to be sure.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.482
Yeah, not a twitch. Dead as a doornail.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.520
Be on your way, then,
Mr Fraser.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.709
Whoa.

24:10.070 --> 24:11.947
Are you wounded, Mr Bonnet?

24:15.870 --> 24:17.906
Danu, the luck giver, was with me.

24:18.450 --> 24:20.452
I think the venison
bore the brunt of it.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.870
They pinked me
in the thigh a bit, though.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.872
Well, let my wife tend to your leg.
She's a healer.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.961
Here, let me look.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.465
It's not bad.

24:48.110 --> 24:49.395
Two wedding bands you wear.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.946
I've been married twice.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.112
Two lucky men, then.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.831
And you've never parted
with the ring from the first?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.160
No.

25:14.260 --> 25:15.500
I never married.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.460
But I've always been partial to rings.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.346
The watchmen dispossessed me of mine.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.568
There's something
about the notion of an infinite circle

25:28.650 --> 25:30.277
that fascinates me.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.605
Oh.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.357
The hangman's noose is a circle

25:35.450 --> 25:38.237
you'd do well to avoid in the future.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.700
It's not the noose I fear, madam.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.460
No?

25:59.390 --> 26:00.800
Since I was a lad,

26:01.470 --> 26:05.304
I've been plagued by... nightmares

26:06.140 --> 26:09.303
of drowning over and over again.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.391
You'd think I'd foresee it and waken.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.349
But I never do.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.315
Not till the water's over my head.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.689
I know it'll be the death of me.

26:28.290 --> 26:31.282
Gray waters, dark with mud,

26:31.380 --> 26:33.371
things swimmin' blindly in it.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.830
Waiting for the sea
to have her way with me.

26:39.220 --> 26:40.960
That they might do the same
when she's done.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.090
Well, nightmares can't harm you.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.842
Uh, no.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.358
It's the sea herself pullin' at me.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.060
Have you ever felt
the sea pullin' at you?

27:07.460 --> 27:08.916
I almost drowned once.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.370
In a storm at sea.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.796
Then you know what I speak of.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.356
Where will you go from here, Mr Bonnet?

27:34.440 --> 27:36.738
Oh, some of my associates
intended to weigh anchor

27:36.820 --> 27:39.812
in a nearby tributary
before the weather turns.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.695
I pray I'm not too late.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.946
Why is it I get a feeling
'tis pirates that ye speak of?

27:47.620 --> 27:50.748
Well, certainly the governors
of the Carolinas would call them so.

27:50.830 --> 27:53.333
The merchants of Wilmington
would regard them otherwise.

27:54.670 --> 27:58.003
No doubt you'll be seeking some reward
for your assistance?

27:58.380 --> 27:59.916
That can be settled.

28:01.550 --> 28:03.177
I saved ye for Hayes' sake.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.881
I'll no' seek reward for such service.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.886
Well, thank you, sir.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.801
You truly are a rare gentleman indeed.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.265
I might advise you to be wary.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.313
Travellers in these woods,
they're often set upon

28:19.400 --> 28:20.890
by thieves and outlaws.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.229
We will.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.319
Thank you.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.247
I must bid you now
adieu.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.952
I hope your good luck continues,
Mr Bonnet.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.462
I found that a man
most often makes his own luck.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.104
I fear we may rouse suspicion
if we pass by the Redcoats so soon.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.896
Hate to deprive you of a warm bed,

28:56.980 --> 28:59.528
but we'll have to stay
in the woods tonight.

28:59.900 --> 29:00.935
I don't mind.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.566
Nor do I.

29:04.030 --> 29:06.737
Let's find a safe place to camp.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.968
It's been such a terrible day.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.551
I feel so luclq to be here with you.

29:36.770 --> 29:39.227
It isn't wrong to be alive, Sassenach.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.275
You're right.

29:48.740 --> 29:52.744
We have to treasure these moments.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.705
Aye.

29:58.590 --> 30:03.869
You and I ken better than most
how fleeting life can be.

30:08.090 --> 30:09.136
Hmm.

30:13.060 --> 30:16.552
Still, can't help but feel sometimes

30:16.640 --> 30:20.519
that all of this could be ripped away
at any moment.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.028
It doesn't matter, Sassenach.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.982
Don't you see
how small a thing death is between us?

30:33.910 --> 30:36.913
After you left me, after Culloden,

30:38.880 --> 30:40.074
I was dead.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.257
Yet all that time I loved you.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.176
I loved you too.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.500
I never stopped.

30:59.940 --> 31:03.603
When my body dies,
my soul will still be yours.

31:05.150 --> 31:06.856
Nothing is lost, Sassenach.

31:09.070 --> 31:10.401
Only changed.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.492
That's the first law of thermodynamics.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.910
No.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.375
No.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.120
That's faith.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.435
I don't care what it is.

31:47.190 --> 31:51.479
I want to feel alive with you right now.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.971
Do you know what lies
beyond those trees?

33:48.110 --> 33:49.099
Aye.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.065
More trees.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.697
Yes, a lot more.

33:56.450 --> 33:59.988
They stretch all the way past
a mighty river named the Mississippi

34:01.080 --> 34:02.365
to the Great Plains.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.531
This is just the start
of what America will become.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.582
Eventually, it will reach
all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.118
North Carolina will just be
one of 50 states.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.926
Hmm.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.631
A|| filled with Scots.

34:22.890 --> 34:25.802
There will be lots
of different people here

34:25.890 --> 34:27.517
from countries all over the world.

34:27.900 --> 34:32.064
And all hoping to live
what will be called the American dream.

34:33.990 --> 34:35.446
Is that the same as our dream?

34:38.820 --> 34:40.151
I suppose it is.

34:52.460 --> 34:57.420
A chance to live in a place
where the only limitations

34:58.340 --> 35:00.217
are a person's own abilities

35:01.050 --> 35:02.756
and the will to succeed.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.687
They'll come here in their thousands.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.599
And then millions.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.696
What about those already here?

35:21.450 --> 35:22.519
The natives.

35:24.370 --> 35:25.746
What becomes of them?

35:28.290 --> 35:29.450
Well...

35:30.830 --> 35:33.799
They are driven
from their ancestral lands.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.875
They're killed.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.137
Or forced to live in reservations.

35:43.510 --> 35:46.422
It's not unlike
what the English did to the Highlanders.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.052
A dream for some
can be a nightmare for others.

36:01.110 --> 36:04.568
I suggested to Jamie
we try and sell the ruby.

36:04.870 --> 36:07.498
As we got ready
for the I/l/ington dinner that night;

36:07.830 --> 36:10.492
our hopes were h/gh
that we’d find a buyer.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.081
It's not too much mutton
dressed as lamb, is it?

36:18.710 --> 36:19.711
Neven

36:21.510 --> 36:22.795
Only thing missing...

36:24.550 --> 36:26.097
is a wee bit of jewellery.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.630
Took it to the goldsmith.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.183
Used some of our coin
to fashion this mount.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.948
Only had time
for any but the simplest design.

36:42.070 --> 36:44.618
- No, simple is best.
-Hmm.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.571
Heard Governor Tryon will be
in attendance,

36:51.250 --> 36:53.366
along with a Baron Penzler.

36:54.630 --> 36:58.122
It's said the Baron's love of money
is accompanied by a love

36:58.210 --> 37:00.087
of the fine objects that come with it.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.623
Well, let's hope
he's a fondness for rubies.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.926
Hmm.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.058
Might I request the pleasure
of your company for dinner?

37:18.980 --> 37:20.060
Madam?

37:20.150 --> 37:21.890
You may.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.582
Governor, Mrs Lillington and I
are so pleased...

37:42.670 --> 37:44.331
Four shillings poll tax...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.716
And four pence per gallon rum duty.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.381
Will it never end?

37:48.470 --> 37:50.301
That's the very least of it, Stanhope.

37:50.390 --> 37:53.348
It's the never-ending expenses
incurred in dividing our land

37:53.430 --> 37:56.149
from that of the Cherokee savages
which worries me.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.970
- All from our taxes. _
- Yes, that's a good question.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.470
It beggars belief,

38:00.730 --> 38:02.812
does it not, Mistress Fraser?

38:03.530 --> 38:05.270
Hmm, though I doubt many women

38:05.360 --> 38:08.739
_ will be familiar
With such prOVInCIal matters.

38:11.410 --> 38:13.401
Well, on the contrary,
Lord Penzler.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.162
I'm sure the very thought
of inequitable taxes

38:16.250 --> 38:18.320
brings out the savage in all of us.

38:18.420 --> 38:20.741
I'm particularly savage
when it comes to taxes

38:20.840 --> 38:22.796
that bear disproportionately
on the poor.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.869
Yes, that's very good.

38:23.970 --> 38:26.040
The savage in all of us.
Yes, indeed.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.842
You must try not to be so amusing,
Mistress Fraser.

38:29.930 --> 38:32.057
It may be the death of poor Stanhope.

38:34.430 --> 38:38.184
Is this the style in Edinburgh,
Mistress Fraser?

38:39.360 --> 38:41.225
How charming.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.020
Such a beautiful stone.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.691
You will permit me to look more closely?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.400
Certainly.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.335
Thank you.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.046
Beautiful.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.089
And without flaw.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.472
The Governor and I have heard
that you are the nephew

39:21.560 --> 39:24.529
of the Widow Cameron of River Run.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.680
Have we been informed correctly,
Mr Fraser?

39:26.780 --> 39:30.193
Aye, Jocasta Cameron is
my late mother's sister.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.571
Either of you acquainted with her?

39:32.660 --> 39:35.402
Yes, I've been acquainted
with Mistress Cameron

39:35.490 --> 39:38.573
for many years. A most charming woman.

39:39.540 --> 39:42.327
Are you familiar with her estate,
Your Excellency?

39:42.420 --> 39:45.162
Hmm, my wife and I passed several days
at Cross Creek last year

39:45.250 --> 39:47.047
during our tour of North Carolina.

39:47.130 --> 39:48.415
River Run, I believe,

39:48.510 --> 39:51.172
is situated on the Cape Fear River
at the foot of the mountains.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.420
Aye.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.767
You know, my family are Highlanders.

39:56.350 --> 39:57.886
Mountains are like home to us.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.430
Well, the Blue Ridge Mountains

39:59.520 --> 40:01.761
are some of the most majestic
you'll see anywhere, Mr Fraser.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.438
Hmm. I intend on seeing them
when I visit my aunt

40:05.520 --> 40:07.067
before returning to Scotland.

40:08.190 --> 40:09.441
Hmm.

40:12.950 --> 40:17.319
Would you join me after dinner
for a pipe and some brandy?

40:17.410 --> 40:18.866
I have a case imported from France.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.077
There's a matter I wish
to put before you.

40:31.130 --> 40:34.349
Mr Lillington tells me
you've been both a farmer and a soldier

40:34.430 --> 40:35.966
and are newly arrived to the Colonies.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.170
Are you familiar with conditions here?

40:38.560 --> 40:40.516
To which conditions
might you refer, sir?

40:42.270 --> 40:45.182
North Carolina, though not
as prosperous as its neighbours,

40:45.270 --> 40:47.067
still offers wealth and prosperity

40:47.150 --> 40:51.063
for those Willing
to persevere and work the land.

40:51.990 --> 40:56.108
The Crown encourages settlement
by industrious, God-fearing families.

40:56.910 --> 40:59.788
His Majesty is wise
to encourage settlement of lands

40:59.870 --> 41:02.361
so rich in opportunity, Your Excellency.

41:03.250 --> 41:06.788
To this end, there is established
a system of land grants

41:06.880 --> 41:09.451
whereby large acreage
may be given to men

41:09.550 --> 41:12.462
who would undertake
to persuade numbers of emigrants

41:12.550 --> 41:16.384
to come and settle on part of it
under their sponsorship.

41:17.050 --> 41:19.632
I did hear mention
of such grants, yet...

41:20.810 --> 41:23.597
Yet is it not true they come
with a steep quitrent per acre

41:23.690 --> 41:25.260
that must be paid in coin?

41:26.560 --> 41:27.686
That is true.

41:28.940 --> 41:31.488
But in frankness, Mr Fraser,

41:32.780 --> 41:34.065
there is the law,

41:34.820 --> 41:36.060
and there is What is done.

41:38.950 --> 41:41.441
It may be possible to dispense
with the requirements

41:41.540 --> 41:43.826
of quitrents
While one acquires settlers.

41:43.910 --> 41:45.787
Provided, of course,
one swears an oath of loyalty

41:45.880 --> 41:48.280
to His Majesty the King,
if not already done so.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.258
And so, not Wishing
to remind you of any past indignity,

41:52.340 --> 41:53.409
it is my duty to ask--

41:53.510 --> 41:54.750
And mine to answer.

41:59.970 --> 42:01.517
I'm a pardoned Jacobite.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.880
I've sworn the oath.

42:05.100 --> 42:08.058
Like so many others that paid
that price to keep their lives.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.140
It's late, Your Excellency.

42:12.940 --> 42:14.646
I must beg to take my leave of you.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.776
Well, good night, Mr Fraser.

42:16.860 --> 42:18.066
Um...

42:18.450 --> 42:19.860
Do consider my offer.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.961
A hundred pounds sterling.

42:38.050 --> 42:39.847
For a single ruby, all thanks to you.

42:41.180 --> 42:44.638
The Baron nearly dropped his eyeballs
into your bosom, the filthy lech.

42:44.730 --> 42:46.937
Had a right mind
to challenge him over it.

42:47.310 --> 42:49.722
Discretion is the better part of valour,

42:49.810 --> 42:52.062
though I've yet to meet a Scot
who seemed to think so.

42:52.150 --> 42:53.276
Hmm.

42:53.730 --> 42:55.231
Be that as it may,

42:55.820 --> 42:57.651
the Baron's eye for fine gemstones

42:57.740 --> 43:00.447
means we've enough money
to secure passage

43:00.530 --> 43:02.236
to Scotland many times over.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.247
With What's left over, I can...

43:06.710 --> 43:09.076
I can purchase a printing press.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.910
You can practice your healing.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.967
Dinna fash, Sassenach. It'll be fine.

43:22.810 --> 43:25.973
John Grey used his influence
to Withdraw the warrant.

43:26.430 --> 43:28.057
I'm no longer a wanted man.

43:29.270 --> 43:33.183
- It's not that.
- You're a terrible liar.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.606
- No, it's nothing.
- Ha.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.812
Thinking so loudly,
I can hear ye from here.

43:40.910 --> 43:44.482
Well, I was thinking about the offer
the Governor made to you.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.200
Aye.

43:49.370 --> 43:51.247
I was thinking on the matter myself.

43:52.460 --> 43:53.449
And?

43:54.130 --> 43:55.165
Huh.

43:56.050 --> 44:00.589
Oh, he's no' offering me land
for the sake of my bonny blue eyes.

44:01.050 --> 44:04.349
Bees that have honey in their mouth
have a sting in their tail.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.635
Ask yourself this.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.629
Why me?

44:10.980 --> 44:14.143
_ _ An outsider _
With few ties and no known loyalties.

44:16.070 --> 44:19.949
Except to the man that's offering you
a large tract of land.

44:20.030 --> 44:21.156
Hmm.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.369
The man's a soldier. A man of strategy.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.530
He kens me as one.

44:27.540 --> 44:30.703
And I understand he's had trouble
with the Regulators

44:30.790 --> 44:32.075
a year past.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.285
Who are the Regulators?

44:35.590 --> 44:37.330
They're men from the Wilderness.

44:38.210 --> 44:39.461
They've taken offence
at What they believe

44:39.550 --> 44:42.963
is illegal behaviour on the part
of Tryon's tax collectors.

44:43.550 --> 44:45.791
So they've taken matters
into their own hands.

44:46.100 --> 44:50.059
They've called meetings,
drawn up petitions,

44:50.140 --> 44:52.096
stirred up a spirit of resistance.

44:52.900 --> 44:54.390
The Governor's clearly worried.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.641
So, if things heat up,

44:57.730 --> 44:59.277
he wants to buy
the loyalty and obligation

44:59.360 --> 45:00.566
of an experienced soldier,

45:00.650 --> 45:03.858
all for the cost of a few acres
of the King's land. Hmm.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.366
He's much sneakier than I thought.

45:06.950 --> 45:08.190
He's practically Scottish.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.241
No.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.741
Oh, Jamie, you have to remember

45:15.880 --> 45:18.087
there's going to be
another war in eight years.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.415
The American Revolution.

45:21.380 --> 45:24.383
If you accepted the Governor's
offer of the land,

45:24.760 --> 45:27.923
he'd expect you to fight for the Crown
against the revolutionaries.

45:28.430 --> 45:30.512
I've fought in wars before, Sassenach.

45:30.720 --> 45:34.724
Yes, but unlike Culloden,
this one the British Will lose.

45:35.850 --> 45:38.102
We would be
on the wrong side of history again.

45:38.730 --> 45:40.937
We would be branded as loyalists,

45:41.030 --> 45:42.770
and the land the Governor
has offered you

45:43.610 --> 45:44.986
would be taken from us.

45:49.160 --> 45:53.073
This becomes Brianna's country,
does it not?

45:56.920 --> 45:58.490
Yes, she was born here.

46:01.550 --> 46:03.836
I dinna Wish to fight in wars again...

46:05.130 --> 46:07.212
or have you in danger, Sassenach,

46:09.560 --> 46:12.461
but if there's a bit I can do
to make this a good land

46:13.480 --> 46:14.629
for Brianna...

46:15.810 --> 46:18.938
If my presence here now
can be felt by her later, then...

46:21.360 --> 46:22.896
Then that would be something.

46:27.990 --> 46:29.230
Yes, it would.

46:37.080 --> 46:40.083
Ian? Ian, where have you been?

46:41.300 --> 46:42.870
And what's this beast you have With you?

46:43.170 --> 46:45.081
Isn't he a handsome dog, Uncle?

46:45.300 --> 46:46.756
Don't think that's a dog, Ian.

46:47.260 --> 46:49.251
More like a bloody wolf.

46:49.340 --> 46:51.968
Broader through the head
and chest than a wolf.

46:52.060 --> 46:53.925
He's a fine creature.
Where'd you get him?

46:54.020 --> 46:55.055
I won him.

46:55.770 --> 46:57.135
Luclq roll of the dice.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.050
So I called him Rollo.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.145
Ye were dicin'?

47:05.070 --> 47:07.061
Aye, with sailors.

47:07.610 --> 47:09.908
But he's not the only thing I won.

47:12.700 --> 47:17.069
Christ, ye shouldn't stake yer life
gambling with sailors.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.950
But you're always at it, Uncle.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.782
Every tavern we've seen fit to rest,
you've wagered our coin.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.950
That's cards, not dice.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.586
And I ken What I'm doing.

47:25.670 --> 47:27.410
Well, I won, did I no'?

47:27.510 --> 47:29.250
We have need of the money
for the journey home.

47:30.970 --> 47:33.131
Aye, well,
if your mother hears of this...

47:34.310 --> 47:36.551
I won't do it again. Promise.

47:37.390 --> 47:39.972
You're right, you won't.
And you won't need to.

47:40.060 --> 47:41.220
We've plenty of money now.

47:41.310 --> 47:43.221
We found a buyer
for the ruby last night.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.106
Well, that's some good news, Auntie.

47:45.320 --> 47:49.063
Aye, well, bring your mongrel
and we'll go inside.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.400
We'll have some food.

47:51.570 --> 47:53.777
Then there's some things
we need to talk about.

47:58.790 --> 48:00.109
Come on, Rollo.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.961
Staying in America?

48:15.600 --> 48:16.635
Aye.

48:17.350 --> 48:20.558
Aye, Claire and I have decided
to try and make a life here.

48:20.770 --> 48:22.476
That's a fine idea.

48:22.770 --> 48:23.930
- We could stay--
- Not we, lad.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.760
Ye'll still be on a ship
bound for Scotland.

48:25.860 --> 48:27.521
Oh, please, Uncle.

48:27.610 --> 48:29.066
I'll not be a worry to ye.

48:29.150 --> 48:30.560
Truly, I swear it.

48:30.650 --> 48:31.947
I'll work to earn my bread.

48:32.030 --> 48:34.578
I've a talent for selling.
Fergus will tell ye.

48:35.490 --> 48:37.731
Ye ken I would like nothing more
than to have ye with me,

48:37.830 --> 48:40.651
but in What God's name
would your mother say?

48:41.080 --> 48:42.411
Oh, I dinna ken.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.700
But she'll be saying it in Scotland,
won't she?

48:47.590 --> 48:48.955
She kens I'm safe with ye.

48:49.050 --> 48:50.790
Ye wrote to her back in Georgia.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.962
I canna say
that particular bit of knowledge

48:53.050 --> 48:56.213
will be over-comforting to her, Ian.

48:57.140 --> 48:59.677
Your parents dinna want
a vagrant's life for you, lad.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.512
They want you to grow to be
a man of learning and influence.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.976
A man of worth.

49:05.690 --> 49:08.067
You'll amount to something
for yer mother's sake.

49:08.730 --> 49:10.231
If it kills us both.

49:11.820 --> 49:13.776
Yer life's no meant
to be wasted.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.149
Where will you settle?

49:21.960 --> 49:24.360
We thought we would work that out
when we're visiting River Run.

49:24.460 --> 49:25.495
Mmm.

49:26.080 --> 49:30.915
Fergus, I want ye to have
a portion of the profit from the ruby.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.672
It will pay for ye and Marsali to return
to Scotland, if that's What you choose.

49:35.930 --> 49:38.592
And there's a bit
for Marsali to take home to her mother.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.965
For the alimony I promised.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.391
There's enough for you as well, Lesley.

49:47.230 --> 49:49.061
I appreciate it, Mac Dubh.

49:50.400 --> 49:55.315
But I'd have ye keep your coin
if I may travel with ye a bit longer.

49:58.030 --> 50:02.319
This is a Wild country,
and... my place is at your side.

50:05.210 --> 50:07.166
Aye, ye may.

50:08.540 --> 50:12.044
We would like to stay
in North Carolina as well, Milord.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.428
Marsali would not be well-suited
to a long journey.

50:22.430 --> 50:23.761
She is with child.

50:26.770 --> 50:27.805
What?

50:29.980 --> 50:32.778
Well, it certainly is a happy surprise.

50:32.860 --> 50:35.192
Aye, was a surprise
to us as well.

50:38.070 --> 50:41.073
Of course, we are delighted.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.696
May God bless you both.

50:45.710 --> 50:48.076
For now,
Marsali and I will stay in Wilmington.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.377
It's a wee bit bigger than Broch Mordha.

50:50.670 --> 50:52.956
I hope to find work as a seamstress,

50:53.340 --> 50:55.661
While Fergus seeks employment himself.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.500
Aye, you'll do fine, Marsali.

50:57.590 --> 51:00.002
And you, you'll make a fine father.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.346
Thank you, Milord.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.097
Campagnia
leaves in under a fortnight.

51:07.190 --> 51:09.932
You two will accompany us
to River Run until then.

51:18.570 --> 51:21.312
- Congratulations. Great news.
- Thanks.

51:43.470 --> 51:45.426
So, What is your Aunt Jocasta like?

51:49.190 --> 51:50.179
She's a MacKenzie.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.640
Hmm.

51:52.480 --> 51:53.890
She's my mother's sister.

51:54.610 --> 51:56.771
And I haven't seen her
Since I was a wee lad.

51:57.320 --> 52:00.812
She wed a John Cameron and left Leoch
before my parents married.

52:01.740 --> 52:03.230
She's never visited Lallybroch?

52:04.410 --> 52:05.729
Aye, once or twice.

52:07.040 --> 52:11.249
Then, John died of a flux,
so she wed his cousin, Hugh Cameron.

52:12.250 --> 52:14.627
Well, he was killed hunting.

52:15.420 --> 52:18.082
So, then she wed Hector Cameron.

52:20.550 --> 52:22.632
Well, she seems to have quite
the taste for Camerons.

52:22.760 --> 52:23.749
Hmm.

52:23.850 --> 52:26.171
Is there something special
about them as a clan?

52:26.260 --> 52:28.558
Outside from being accident-prone.

52:29.180 --> 52:32.013
Well, they have a way wi' words.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.012
Camerons are poets and jesters.

52:35.270 --> 52:37.977
So which is Hector? A poet or a jester?

52:38.280 --> 52:39.429
Neither.

52:40.450 --> 52:41.485
He's dead now, too.

52:45.330 --> 52:47.901
So, how did they come
to be in North Carolina?

52:47.990 --> 52:51.619
Well, after the Rising, he and Jocasta
fled Scotland and came here.

52:52.920 --> 52:57.835
He was granted land, built a house
and a saw mill, planted tobacco.

52:58.510 --> 53:01.877
And then he died
of a morbid sore throat a year past.

53:05.300 --> 53:10.010
Well, I hope the messenger arrives
with your letter before we do.

53:11.390 --> 53:13.642
He'd arrive before we do
if he crawled on his hands and knees.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.646
Well, keep going, lad.

53:16.980 --> 53:19.938
I expect ye'll have us
in River Run before nightfall.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.445
POOl' man deserves a rest.

53:29.620 --> 53:32.202
Shouldn't have elderly slaves
on their feet all day.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.127
Needn't worry yourself, madam.

53:37.210 --> 53:38.620
He earns a fair wage for his work.

53:38.710 --> 53:40.541
Isn't that right, Eutroclus?

53:40.630 --> 53:42.586
Yes, I do, Captain.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.540
You mean to say that you're free?

53:45.260 --> 53:46.466
Yes, madam.

53:46.550 --> 53:48.006
He used to be my slave.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.092
Till one day I fell asleep
with the lamp still burning.

53:51.180 --> 53:54.593
The cabin caught fire
and Troklus pulled me out in time.

53:54.850 --> 53:56.647
After that,
I petitioned a court for his release

53:56.730 --> 53:58.015
on the grounds of meritorious service

53:58.110 --> 54:00.351
and offered a surety for his freedom.

54:01.070 --> 54:04.392
Been working for me ever since.
Best waterman on the river.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.867
You must be grateful
every day for What he's done for you.

54:24.260 --> 54:26.125
Keep your eye up river.

54:26.220 --> 54:28.711
You'll want to steer around any logs.

54:28.970 --> 54:31.712
All right, lad.
It's your turn at the pole.

54:32.430 --> 54:34.478
This is harder than it looks.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.687
The current is stronger than I imagined.

54:38.900 --> 54:41.266
Will you join me, Sassenach?

54:44.610 --> 54:45.986
Of course.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.410
Well, What's this?

55:05.550 --> 55:06.710
A present.

55:11.010 --> 55:12.170
Open it.

55:34.580 --> 55:35.649
Do ye like it?

55:40.380 --> 55:41.779
Oh, Jamie.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.876
It's wonderful.

55:51.050 --> 55:52.847
Where did you find it?

55:53.470 --> 55:54.801
I saw the box when I--

55:54.890 --> 55:57.131
When I went to the goldsmith
to have the ruby set.

55:57.230 --> 55:58.766
Oh, my God.

56:01.020 --> 56:02.226
It's a microscope.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.186
Aye.

56:08.030 --> 56:12.273
And, perhaps, one day,
I'll deck ye in laces and jewels.

56:17.330 --> 56:19.571
I havena been able to give ye much ever,

56:20.870 --> 56:22.280
save for this wee ring.

56:23.460 --> 56:24.870
And my mother's pearls.

56:26.460 --> 56:28.792
You've given me so much more.

56:35.180 --> 56:36.716
Brianna, for one.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.477
I gave the pearls to her.

56:42.310 --> 56:44.107
They're an heirloom, after all.

56:47.110 --> 56:49.146
And this ring is all I need.

56:50.990 --> 56:53.231
Twenty-four years ago
I married ye, Sassenach.

56:55.870 --> 56:58.327
I hope I haven't ever
given you cause to regret it.

57:03.210 --> 57:04.871
Not for a single day.

57:44.170 --> 57:46.786
Mr and Mrs Fraser,
pleasure to see you again.

57:47.290 --> 57:48.700
Stay here, Claire.

58:00.220 --> 58:01.266
Come on, Claire.

58:01.470 --> 58:02.676
We've got to go. Come on.

58:02.850 --> 58:03.885
Oh!

58:04.890 --> 58:06.346
Ian!

58:06.810 --> 58:07.856
Get out of here!

58:15.950 --> 58:21.946
Who more than self their country loved

58:23.620 --> 58:28.410
And mercy more than life

58:34.800 --> 58:40.215
America, America

58:43.270 --> 58:46.979
May God thy gold refine

58:49.110 --> 58:53.774
777/ all success

58:55.200 --> 58:58.192
Be nob/eness

58:59.240 --> 59:04.280
And every gain divine

59:04.790 --> 59:06.997
And you know, when I was in school
We used to sing it something l/ke this

59:07.080 --> 59:08.069
Listen here

59:08.830 --> 59:15.463
0 beautiful for spacious skies

59:19.890 --> 59:23.553
For amber waves of grain

59:28.100 --> 59:34.687
For purple mountain majesties

59:37.280 --> 59:41.364
Above the fruited plain

59:41.820 --> 59:44.368
Well, now wait a minute

59:44.700 --> 59:48.909
I ’m talking about America

59:49.920 --> 59:53.412
Sweet America

59:55.090 --> 59:59.789
You know
God done shed his grace on thee

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:08.169
He crowned thy good
Yes, he did

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:11.347
And in brotherhood

1:00:11.730 --> 1:00:17.179
From sea to sh/n/ng sea

1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:19.981
You ought to love Him for it

1:00:20.070 --> 1:00:23.858
He crowned thy good

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:29.650
He told me He would
And in brotherhood

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:35.580
From sea to sh/n/ng sea

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:42.216
0 Lord; 0 Lord!
I thank you, Lord

1:00:42.430 --> 1:00:46.093
Shin/ng sea
