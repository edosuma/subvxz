WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:04.415
You know Kosta's getting dead birds
dropped in the yard from a drone,

00:04.452 --> 00:06.703
- packed with drugs.
- I'm moving to the laundry.

00:06.709 --> 00:09.493
Jackson's transferring me.
Got my eye on that steam press.

00:09.549 --> 00:10.677
Over my dead body.

00:10.689 --> 00:14.222
- Might have to take you up on that.
- I want you to kill Kaz Proctor.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.932
You gotta go into protection.

00:16.197 --> 00:18.331
- Today.
- Nah. Then they'll come after you.

00:18.337 --> 00:19.933
It was either you or her.

00:19.939 --> 00:21.469
Why? What's she got on you?

00:21.521 --> 00:22.959
I can't talk about it.

00:22.994 --> 00:25.144
What do I have to do
to keep my sister safe?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.048
Proctor knows about us.

00:27.066 --> 00:28.890
I don't know how, but
if she tells anyone,

00:28.902 --> 00:31.941
- I'm fucked and so are you.
- Do you think I'm crazy?

00:31.947 --> 00:33.374
- Fuck!
- Ahh!

00:33.380 --> 00:35.144
- Stop! Ahh!
- Fuck you!

00:35.181 --> 00:37.349
- What the hell's going on?
- Get Dr Miller, quick.

00:37.355 --> 00:39.759
Bubba. I love you.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.209
No, I'm OK.

06:05.334 --> 06:08.420
- Anything?
- Well, five cameras were moved,

06:08.545 --> 06:12.016
but this was captured in
one of the H Block corridors.

06:12.043 --> 06:15.521
This was less than a minute
before Ms Bennett found the body.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.722
- Blood?
- It's impossible to tell who it is.

06:17.728 --> 06:19.767
Do the inmates know about
the writing on the floor?

06:19.773 --> 06:21.841
- No.
- Well, let's keep it under wraps.

06:21.892 --> 06:24.478
We need that hoodie, along
with the murder weapon.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.760
I've called the dog squad,

06:25.796 --> 06:28.569
so while the women are in lockdown,
we'll raid the entire prison.

06:28.617 --> 06:29.774
We'll also need some rooms

06:29.795 --> 06:32.132
- set aside for interviews.
- I can arrange that.

06:32.197 --> 06:34.206
You should start with Marie Winter.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.494
Hang on.

06:38.053 --> 06:39.744
Why are we jumping to conclusions?

06:39.768 --> 06:43.088
You know their history. Why else
would she scrawl 'M' on the floor?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.376
Sorry.

06:45.916 --> 06:49.054
- Long night.
- We'll interview all the women in H Block.

06:55.557 --> 06:57.259
This place.

06:58.337 --> 07:00.858
The last thing that she said to me...

07:01.552 --> 07:03.479
was that she loved me.

07:03.911 --> 07:05.818
And I... I didn't...

07:05.824 --> 07:08.574
They're keeping us locked up
all day? I want some breakfast.

07:08.587 --> 07:10.011
Well, make it yourself.

07:10.048 --> 07:12.391
Oh, don't pretend like you give a shit.

07:12.397 --> 07:15.782
- You hated Proctor as much as I did.
- Shut the fuck up, Kosta.

07:15.788 --> 07:18.592
- Another one bites the dust.
- Hey, she's not worth it.

07:18.655 --> 07:19.782
Come on.

07:21.071 --> 07:23.291
All right, stay in the lounge, ladies.

07:23.303 --> 07:26.601
- What's this?
- Do as you're told. Sit, Kosta! Hutchins, move it!

07:27.112 --> 07:29.044
You boys want some toast?

07:37.174 --> 07:39.015
Are they gonna arrest me?

07:39.735 --> 07:41.000
Why would they?

07:41.006 --> 07:42.422
'Cause I attacked her.

07:42.423 --> 07:44.467
Liz, you weren't thinking straight.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.283
You flipped out. It wasn't your fault.

07:46.314 --> 07:49.246
- She protected me and I attacked her.
- Hey.

07:49.722 --> 07:52.318
She really loved you, right?

07:52.561 --> 07:54.438
She knew you didn't mean it.

07:54.671 --> 07:57.422
And I'm gonna look after you now, OK?

07:57.433 --> 07:58.561
- All right?
- Yeah.

07:58.597 --> 08:01.218
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.191
Mr Stewart?

08:07.238 --> 08:09.968
Uh, we were talking
last night and... and,

08:10.093 --> 08:12.364
- we wanna do something for Kaz.
- Yeah.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.417
Like a memorial or something.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.705
Do you reckon we could?

08:15.990 --> 08:18.808
Well, I can't make any promises, but...

08:19.176 --> 08:20.691
I'll put it to the Governor, eh?

08:20.753 --> 08:23.240
- Thanks.
- Narelle Stang wasn't here for the lockdown.

08:23.365 --> 08:26.612
- Where is she?
- Protection Unit. She won't be back.

08:26.669 --> 08:28.308
Did she kill Kaz?

08:28.680 --> 08:30.325
You know I can't tell you that.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.418
- Fuck.
- What?

08:36.543 --> 08:38.424
Stang and Kaz had history.

08:42.158 --> 08:43.653
She wanted Kaz dead.

08:43.705 --> 08:45.505
I don't give a shit.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.721
If they want a statement, they
can call Corrections but right now,

08:48.733 --> 08:51.287
I want them cleared
away from the main gate.

08:51.349 --> 08:54.137
- Fuckin' vultures.
- The police have started interviewing.

08:54.147 --> 08:55.674
- I've given them two rooms.
- Fine.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.101
- Mr Jackson?
- Yes?

08:57.132 --> 08:59.723
There's protestors at the gate.
It's that Red Right Hand group.

08:59.759 --> 09:00.990
- What, with the media?
- Yeah.

09:01.016 --> 09:02.811
- Oh, shit.
- You wanna handball the Press Office to me?

09:02.835 --> 09:04.035
Ahh, yeah, do it. Thank you.

09:04.056 --> 09:05.527
Any sign of the hoodie
or the murder weapon?

09:05.551 --> 09:07.852
- No, not yet.
- Well, what is the weapon, a shiv?

09:07.853 --> 09:10.924
The police think it's a boxcutter
so keep an eye out for that, please.

09:10.937 --> 09:12.450
Have you thought about
counselling for the women?

09:12.462 --> 09:14.199
- Because Dr Miller said...
- I've already spoken to him.

09:14.223 --> 09:15.686
What time are we letting
the women out of lockdown?

09:15.702 --> 09:17.052
Look, I'm lifting it tonight.

09:17.072 --> 09:19.477
Proctor's unit requested
a memorial in the yard.

09:19.514 --> 09:20.687
What about dinner?

09:20.703 --> 09:22.425
Ahh, we'll give them a late dinner

09:22.435 --> 09:24.333
and shift the final count back to 10:00.

09:24.359 --> 09:26.604
I'm not sure a memorial's
a good idea. Not tonight.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.313
Putting a large group
of prisoners together

09:29.314 --> 09:31.166
in a heightened emotional
state is never a good idea.

09:31.181 --> 09:33.426
Well, keeping them cooped up
will just make things worse.

09:33.436 --> 09:34.996
- Yeah, well, just wait...
- Vera, stop.

09:35.893 --> 09:38.959
OK, can everyone just get
on with their fucking jobs?

09:53.730 --> 09:55.370
For what it's worth,
I think you're right.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.500
The memorial. It's too soon.

09:58.152 --> 10:00.248
I mean, the women want paper lanterns.

10:00.278 --> 10:02.879
Linda's making me go buy
them. She's so fucking lazy.

10:02.910 --> 10:05.568
Jake, I'm really tired. Is
there something you wanted?

10:06.835 --> 10:09.385
I... I guess I just
wanted to say thanks.

10:09.411 --> 10:11.144
For the ultrasound photo.

10:11.341 --> 10:13.187
I can't stop looking at it.

10:16.037 --> 10:17.588
Nice flowers.

10:17.713 --> 10:19.740
I really do have a lot to do.

10:20.288 --> 10:21.762
Yep.

10:24.054 --> 10:27.182
Mr Jackson wanted Proctor's
notes but I can't get hold of him.

10:27.203 --> 10:29.463
Well, he's inundated right
now. I can pass them on.

10:29.483 --> 10:30.704
Thanks.

10:30.829 --> 10:34.484
You were one of the last
people to see Proctor alive.

10:34.493 --> 10:37.183
Did she mention any
problems with other inmates?

10:37.213 --> 10:39.577
I asked about Marie Winter.

10:39.614 --> 10:41.376
- Yeah, how did she react?
- Pretty casual.

10:41.397 --> 10:43.104
She didn't seem too worried at all.

10:44.904 --> 10:48.248
- The police will want to interview you.
- Yeah, of course, yeah. Whatever they need.

10:48.272 --> 10:52.557
Um... I never thanked
you for the flowers.

10:52.573 --> 10:54.348
You don't owe me anything.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.345
Just days like this

10:56.694 --> 10:58.627
put things in perspective.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.219
So let's start over.

11:09.632 --> 11:11.323
This is a nice idea, Liz.

11:11.339 --> 11:14.602
Yeah, yeah, well, Kaz and I saw
lanterns like these on TV once and

11:15.005 --> 11:16.634
she thought they were beautiful.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.752
She's been so good to me.

11:20.171 --> 11:22.634
Least we can do is give
her a good send-off, eh?

11:22.759 --> 11:24.516
I can't fuckin' do it properly.

11:24.547 --> 11:27.589
No, you just put it
through this way, look.

11:29.453 --> 11:31.137
Do you still think it was Stang?

11:31.262 --> 11:32.450
Dunno.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.374
But it makes sense.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.677
Well, it could have been Marie,

11:35.703 --> 11:38.268
or Kosta, or any of
those junkie bitches.

11:38.304 --> 11:39.830
Whoever did it should pay.

11:40.399 --> 11:41.568
Kaz deserves justice.

11:41.588 --> 11:45.033
Yeah, well, that's a problem
'cause there is no fuckin' justice.

11:45.053 --> 11:46.662
I still can't do it.

11:49.013 --> 11:51.266
Oh, it's a big one.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.042
Well, these charges
sure have thrown him

11:54.053 --> 11:56.913
into another emotional tailspin...

12:01.971 --> 12:03.466
Hey.

12:05.907 --> 12:07.200
You OK?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.884
I couldn't help them.
I don't know anything.

12:10.059 --> 12:11.642
No, me neither.

12:11.895 --> 12:14.838
They're wasting their
time questioning us.

12:15.857 --> 12:17.771
Who the fuck could've done this?

12:18.464 --> 12:20.393
Lockdown's been lifted.

12:22.048 --> 12:24.892
H1 are holding a memorial in
the yard if you're interested.

12:25.363 --> 12:28.372
Fuck that. I'd rather watch telly.

Kaz saved my life.

13:39.641 --> 13:41.467
She saved a lot of us.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.741
We counted on her.

13:47.584 --> 13:49.700
Not just as a Top Dog.

13:50.341 --> 13:52.260
She was our friend.

13:54.731 --> 13:57.137
Being in here is really hard.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.933
It's scary. It's lonely.

14:02.779 --> 14:04.930
And sometimes, you just...

14:05.380 --> 14:08.085
need someone in your corner.

14:09.094 --> 14:13.089
- And Kaz was always in my corner.
- Oh, sweetheart.

14:13.273 --> 14:16.050
It's all right, love.
It's all right, love.

14:16.792 --> 14:20.737
And Allie's right, 'cause
Kaz was always in her corner.

14:20.773 --> 14:23.933
- What's she doin' here?
- That fuckin' bitch.

14:25.148 --> 14:26.685
Hey, Winter.

14:27.156 --> 14:28.601
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

14:28.625 --> 14:31.180
- I've come to pay my respects.
- Bullshit.

14:31.206 --> 14:34.221
Oi! Any aggro and we're shutting
this thing down. Are we clear?

14:34.226 --> 14:35.545
How can you even go near her?

14:35.670 --> 14:36.889
She murdered Kaz!

14:36.890 --> 14:38.902
- I did not!
- Last chance, Alston.

14:38.927 --> 14:41.673
Just stop it. You're fuckin'
spoiling it, OK? Just...

14:42.428 --> 14:45.749
Marie, come and get a lantern. It's OK.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.393
Thanks, Liz.

14:47.394 --> 14:49.472
Thank you for your
beautiful words, Allie.

14:49.498 --> 14:52.012
We know how much it hurts,

14:52.053 --> 14:55.331
and we want you to know that
we're all here for you, aren't we?

14:56.231 --> 14:58.056
Does anybody else wanna speak?

14:58.082 --> 14:59.872
Fucking bitch! You're dead!

14:59.893 --> 15:02.267
- Get the lights on!
- Don't!

15:02.293 --> 15:04.233
- Just stop!
- Why are you protecting her?

15:04.259 --> 15:05.412
She murdered Kaz!

15:05.432 --> 15:07.237
- Let me see.
- She was with me!

15:07.470 --> 15:08.738
Bullshit.

15:09.529 --> 15:11.145
- Half an hour before lockdown...
- Let me through!

15:11.169 --> 15:13.879
... she was in my cell, OK?

15:14.324 --> 15:17.396
- So point that fucking shiv somewhere else!
- Drop the shiv, Alston!

15:17.437 --> 15:18.482
- Drop it!
- Get off me!

15:18.498 --> 15:20.277
- Fuck.
- Get off!

15:20.292 --> 15:23.157
- That's it, we're shutting this down.
- You're fucking dead, Winter!

15:23.172 --> 15:25.122
Yeah, well, fuck you!

15:36.154 --> 15:38.430
I don't need to go into Protection.

15:38.461 --> 15:42.246
All right? They trust Allie. Now
they know it wasn't me, I'm fine.

15:42.287 --> 15:43.901
You're taking a bloody big risk.

15:43.937 --> 15:45.587
I don't know why you
want to stay in General.

15:45.603 --> 15:47.676
Because if I hide myself
away, they'll think I'm guilty.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.090
- At least you'd be safe.
- I'm not going, Will, all right?

15:52.776 --> 15:55.884
Hey, you look tired, hmm?

15:56.861 --> 15:58.677
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

16:02.133 --> 16:03.652
How'd they do it?

16:05.777 --> 16:07.174
They cut her throat.

16:09.966 --> 16:11.378
I wasn't involved.

16:12.692 --> 16:15.489
- You do believe me, don't you?
- Course I do.

16:16.425 --> 16:18.568
- Doesn't mean you're safe out there.
- Hey.

16:21.499 --> 16:23.588
Let me worry about that.

16:33.388 --> 16:35.395
Do you think Marie could have done it?

16:35.520 --> 16:36.999
She's got an alibi.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.278
Well, if Allie says she was
with her, then I believe her.

16:40.293 --> 16:42.046
Maybe you're right
about Stang, then, hey?

16:42.072 --> 16:43.546
What'd you say?

16:43.938 --> 16:45.205
Um,

16:45.583 --> 16:48.012
it's not lagging if she's
already locked up, is it?

16:48.277 --> 16:49.927
- Is it?
- No, no.

16:49.948 --> 16:53.801
We know why Narelle Stang is
in Protection. She killed Kaz.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.640
Stang was already locked
up when Proctor died.

16:56.935 --> 16:58.916
Any other theories you'd like to share?

16:58.942 --> 17:00.364
So the cops don't have a lead?

17:00.415 --> 17:03.100
If she was your friend, you owe
it to her to tell us what happened.

17:03.126 --> 17:05.039
- We don't know.
- Yeah, we don't know.

17:06.327 --> 17:07.839
So, if it wasn't Marie or Stang,

17:07.840 --> 17:09.363
- who the fuck was it?
- Mmm.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.178
Kosta?

17:13.247 --> 17:15.719
- Yeah, probably.
- Attention, Compound. Attention, Compound.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.647
H Block are now called for dinner.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.430
Kosta's working the room.

17:29.513 --> 17:31.318
Must be angling for Kaz's job.

17:31.338 --> 17:33.976
Yeah, she wants to call
a bloody vote tomorrow.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.436
It's bloody disgusting. Kaz's
only been gone ten minutes.

17:37.866 --> 17:39.434
So who are they gonna
put up against her?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.829
'Cause I'm not bloody doing it.

17:40.844 --> 17:43.488
- Hey, what about you, Rita?
- Not my scene.

17:43.503 --> 17:45.676
Yeah. If we have to have someone,

17:45.707 --> 17:47.895
- you'd be bloody awesome, hey?
- If you put your hand up,

17:47.910 --> 17:49.332
we'll be voting for ya.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.059
Well, my hand's not up.

17:57.312 --> 17:58.932
Ooh!

17:59.319 --> 18:02.651
If there's any trouble, you'll
be joining Alston in the slot.

18:05.009 --> 18:08.438
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- It's OK, just get your food.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.646
I'm not hungry.

18:12.451 --> 18:14.008
You're dead!

18:23.451 --> 18:24.769
Anyone wanna say anything?

18:24.780 --> 18:26.699
- 'Cause I'm up for a chat.
- Sit down, Winter.

18:27.799 --> 18:30.121
I'll sit down when I've
got my food and not before.

18:36.555 --> 18:38.830
- Nice try.
- Why are you provoking them?

18:38.846 --> 18:41.488
Because if they're afraid
of me, that gives me power.

18:41.499 --> 18:44.111
And power is safety in here, right?

18:46.811 --> 18:48.528
Vera, you need to go home.

18:48.538 --> 18:50.653
No, no, look. I've found something.

18:50.953 --> 18:52.158
Look.

18:52.413 --> 18:55.753
This was recorded a few minutes
before the cameras were moved.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.008
Winter is wearing a hoodie.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.909
And then, a few moments later,

19:00.991 --> 19:03.433
just before the lockdown was called,

19:03.877 --> 19:05.046
no hoodie.

19:06.758 --> 19:08.340
And didn't Novak say that she and Winter

19:08.360 --> 19:10.181
were in her cell when
the attack happened?

19:10.248 --> 19:11.738
Why would she lie?

19:12.287 --> 19:14.428
I'm showing this to Detective Minton.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.994
Why are you protecting Marie Winter?

19:20.093 --> 19:22.505
Did she force you to cover for her?

19:23.508 --> 19:25.546
Then why are you lying?

19:26.073 --> 19:27.314
I'm not lying.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.207
I took off my hoodie 'cause I was hot.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.919
I put it in the laundry trolley.

19:30.966 --> 19:33.898
- And where is it now?
- In the laundry, probably.

19:33.981 --> 19:35.155
Why?

19:35.212 --> 19:36.981
Did you kill Kaz Proctor?

19:37.106 --> 19:40.585
- I would never hurt Kaz.
- So why did you lie to us?

19:43.740 --> 19:45.850
I was trying to protect Marie.

19:46.053 --> 19:48.995
I knew that if Kaz's crew thought
she did it, they'd kill her.

19:49.191 --> 19:51.281
And I didn't want to lose her, too.

19:51.705 --> 19:52.977
That's the truth.

19:53.344 --> 19:54.766
I swear.

19:58.076 --> 20:01.200
Attention, Compound.
Count will commence in five minutes.

20:01.272 --> 20:02.524
Hey.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.430
Well, they didn't believe a word I said.

20:07.095 --> 20:11.600
They're charging me with
obstructing justice or something.

20:11.613 --> 20:14.820
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. I wish
you hadn't tried to cover for me.

20:17.328 --> 20:18.729
Where were you when it happened?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.426
Well, I was heading back to the laundry.

20:21.222 --> 20:23.596
- What, you think I...
- No. No.

20:23.933 --> 20:25.598
Heard the cops dragged you in again.

20:25.644 --> 20:28.587
- Fuck off, Kosta!
- Hey, you better watch yourself.

20:28.634 --> 20:30.926
Unless you want that
pretty face steam-pressed.

20:31.051 --> 20:32.601
We're voting tomorrow.

20:32.850 --> 20:35.446
Only a matter of time
before I take that top job.

20:37.965 --> 20:40.680
Hey, Kosta's all talk.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.515
She wants free rein
to bring in her gear.

20:43.541 --> 20:47.932
Come on. Getting that job's about
smarts and timing, not just bribery.

20:48.057 --> 20:49.911
At your doors, thanks, ladies.

20:51.173 --> 20:53.103
All right, let's make this fast.

20:53.129 --> 20:56.035
Winter, Novak, Kosta, Hutchins.

20:56.056 --> 20:57.581
All right, done. Off to bed.

20:57.607 --> 21:00.804
- Wanna join me?
- Not in a million years, Kosta.

21:01.766 --> 21:03.089
Mr Stewart,

21:04.082 --> 21:05.928
are the police looking at Kosta?

21:06.539 --> 21:10.112
She wants to bring in her drugs
without any aggro and now she can.

21:10.128 --> 21:12.403
But we need evidence, not just theories.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.896
Right, you really wanna help?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.612
Cops have got CCTV of the killer.

21:18.780 --> 21:22.152
They can't see who it is but there's
a bloodstain on the sleeve, there.

21:23.099 --> 21:24.722
We need to find that hoodie.

21:25.813 --> 21:28.255
But haven't the cells
already been searched?

21:28.312 --> 21:30.464
Yeah. It's gotta be somewhere.

21:37.569 --> 21:39.328
Marie hasn't got it in her.

21:39.411 --> 21:42.689
She's a piece of work, all right,
but she never gets her hands dirty.

21:43.558 --> 21:46.640
I reckon Stang went into
Protection to give herself an alibi

21:46.655 --> 21:48.615
and got someone else to kill Kaz.

21:49.159 --> 21:50.881
She was blackmailing me,

21:51.729 --> 21:54.057
so she must have had
someone else on the side.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.313
A backup.

21:56.369 --> 21:59.214
Can you stop being a cop
for, like, five minutes?

21:59.339 --> 22:00.493
Sorry.

22:02.104 --> 22:04.695
You OK? You've been pretty quiet today.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.570
I'm just tired.

22:07.853 --> 22:09.267
I'm gonna go to bed.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.827
Night.

22:16.895 --> 22:19.051
Attention,
Compound. Attention, Compound.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.874
- H Block are now called to breakfast.
- We just have to keep it,

22:20.898 --> 22:23.655
- get her to do it, you know?
- Yeah, yeah, just get her to say it.

22:23.949 --> 22:25.469
What?

22:27.719 --> 22:29.865
This must be where it happened, eh?

22:30.170 --> 22:33.459
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.438
Yeah, it's... it's not right, is it?

22:37.131 --> 22:38.284
Just...

22:39.401 --> 22:41.780
dying here, on your own like that.

22:42.722 --> 22:44.770
She must have been real scared.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.876
You know, um, if I gotta go,

22:52.549 --> 22:56.200
I wanna be in a big, comfy bed
with all me mates around me, OK?

22:56.325 --> 22:58.957
- Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:01.519 --> 23:04.201
Anyway, come on. We're gonna be
late for brekkie. We'd better go.

23:08.797 --> 23:10.349
Lizzie, come on.

23:10.879 --> 23:12.974
Lizzie. Come on.

23:26.654 --> 23:28.328
This way.

23:29.693 --> 23:31.910
Oi, you gonna eat?

23:32.265 --> 23:33.791
I already had some toast.

23:33.843 --> 23:35.552
Wanna come with me anyway?

23:35.811 --> 23:37.833
- I can't.
- Mitchell.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.115
Police are here.

23:39.855 --> 23:41.360
You already had your interview.

23:41.597 --> 23:44.281
- Um, I have another one.
- Why?

23:46.475 --> 23:49.060
I don't know, same old
questions, over and over again.

23:49.081 --> 23:52.072
They haven't re-interviewed
me or Boomer or Liz. Why you?

23:52.112 --> 23:53.923
- Mitchell.
- I gotta go, sis.

23:54.652 --> 23:56.152
I'll see ya later, eh?

24:02.388 --> 24:05.212
They wouldn't be laughing if
they knew she'd killed Kaz.

24:09.597 --> 24:11.811
Any more thoughts about
throwing your hat in the ring?

24:11.821 --> 24:13.548
Yeah, we don't want Kosta in charge.

24:13.549 --> 24:15.142
- Please.
- You gotta do it. Come on.

24:15.157 --> 24:16.435
I've got enough on my plate.

24:16.466 --> 24:17.940
- Like what?
- Yeah?

24:26.359 --> 24:27.942
You got a problem?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.049
Why don't you come join us?

24:34.649 --> 24:36.025
No, thanks.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.410
Better start showing some respect.

24:39.263 --> 24:41.269
Lunchtime, I'll be calling the vote.

24:41.394 --> 24:42.831
Then I'll be running this place.

24:42.956 --> 24:46.395
- Oh!
- Get your hands off her, bitch.

24:47.176 --> 24:49.286
- Fuck off.
- Winter.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.122
Kosta. Sit down.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.793
There's room for two
under that steam press.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.187
You heard him.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.573
Sit.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.034
Let everyone know I've
got a new shipment.

26:07.058 --> 26:09.189
Make sure they're all
sweet for the vote.

26:18.345 --> 26:20.340
I've found where Kosta keeps her stash.

26:20.465 --> 26:23.508
There's a ceiling vent above
the bookshelves in Education.

26:23.509 --> 26:26.076
- So?
- So I'm gonna tell the screws.

26:26.201 --> 26:28.364
I'll get her slotted and stop
her from becoming Top Dog.

26:28.388 --> 26:30.374
If she finds out you
lagged, she's gonna kill you.

26:30.390 --> 26:32.164
- Yeah, I'll do it anonymously.
- Allie,

26:32.174 --> 26:35.355
it's too dangerous, all right?
And the women know she's a dealer.

26:35.381 --> 26:37.604
That won't change their opinion of her.

26:40.713 --> 26:44.256
So she kills Kaz and now she's
gonna be fucking rewarded?

26:52.187 --> 26:54.102
Fuck!

26:54.710 --> 26:56.108
Ahh!

26:56.597 --> 26:59.418
Lizzie. Why are you
wandering off for, eh?

26:59.439 --> 27:01.992
I, uh... I... I wanted to see...

27:02.018 --> 27:03.296
Yeah, no, I... I...

27:03.312 --> 27:05.287
I, um, don't think it's
very good for you to be here

27:05.303 --> 27:06.699
'cause you're getting upset. Come on.

27:06.714 --> 27:07.948
No, no, no... OK, come on.

27:07.971 --> 27:09.256
- Get... get... get...
- No, we're just gonna...

27:09.280 --> 27:10.852
- Get out!
- Liz!

27:10.862 --> 27:12.367
Fuck!

27:14.234 --> 27:15.522
Lizzie!

27:17.793 --> 27:19.469
- Liz!
- Oh.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.607
Yeah, um,

27:25.803 --> 27:28.731
you want me to make you a cup of tea?

27:28.856 --> 27:30.236
Yeah?

27:30.805 --> 27:32.357
Maybe we can sort out

27:32.377 --> 27:36.131
- some of your bucket list stuff.
- I'm... I'm starting to remember.

27:36.343 --> 27:37.621
Yeah?

27:37.869 --> 27:40.628
That's good, isn't it?

27:40.642 --> 27:42.268
It's like, they changed your medicine

27:42.281 --> 27:45.431
- and so it must be helping your dementias, eh?
- I don't... I don't know what to do.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.883
Nah, it's good. You
just gotta go with it.

27:47.961 --> 27:50.060
But you gotta stay
calm. Kaz'd tell ya to...

27:50.086 --> 27:51.829
- She's dead!
- ... try to stay calm, wouldn't she?

27:51.853 --> 27:53.347
Yeah, I know that, Lizzie. But,

27:53.399 --> 27:55.737
she'd tell you to stay calm,
so can you do that for me?

27:55.768 --> 27:58.678
Yeah, she's dead because of me.

27:58.746 --> 28:02.488
- Oh, no, see, you're getting confused.
- No, no, no, I remember.

28:02.513 --> 28:04.152
I attacked her.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.030
Yeah, and you went to
Medical and Kaz was there

28:07.056 --> 28:09.045
- and she was fine...
- No! No.

28:09.690 --> 28:13.294
It happened again,
after they released me.

28:15.796 --> 28:17.423
What do you mean?

28:19.425 --> 28:21.127
I remember.

28:22.366 --> 28:23.624
I remember.

28:23.655 --> 28:25.701
Fuck!

28:29.010 --> 28:31.238
Just let me know if you
need another appointment.

28:31.244 --> 28:32.821
Dr Greg!

28:32.858 --> 28:34.829
- Hi, Boomer. Thanks, Shaz.
- Hi.

28:34.878 --> 28:37.463
- How are you doing?
- Um, yeah, OK, yeah.

28:37.513 --> 28:40.042
- Good. Um, no, no, no,
- I'm not OK, actually,

28:40.055 --> 28:41.690
everything's really fuckin' weird.

28:41.723 --> 28:45.014
Yes. Well, look, I'm seeing
you this afternoon, so...

28:45.046 --> 28:46.046
- Yeah.
- ... can we talk then?

28:46.069 --> 28:49.051
Ahh, no. No! I need to talk to you now.

28:49.821 --> 28:51.211
OK, um,

28:51.870 --> 28:54.120
I can't name names, right? But, um,

28:54.153 --> 28:56.348
- I need advice.
- OK.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.674
What if someone thought they'd
done something really bad,

29:00.120 --> 29:03.494
but they can't remember the whole
thing, just bits of the thing.

29:03.507 --> 29:07.625
So they don't know that
it's bad, but it looks bad.

29:08.343 --> 29:09.755
Boomer, what have you done?

29:09.812 --> 29:12.387
No, not me. I haven't got the dementia.

29:13.344 --> 29:14.908
Oh, shit.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.387
Shouldn't you call the cops?

29:19.662 --> 29:21.824
No, not until I know all the facts.

29:27.730 --> 29:30.088
What do you remember about that day?

29:31.122 --> 29:33.548
- Do you remember leaving Medical?
- Yes.

29:34.215 --> 29:36.082
I took your pills

29:36.123 --> 29:39.268
and then an officer
walked me back to my unit.

29:39.523 --> 29:41.869
I remember standing in the unit.

29:42.976 --> 29:44.543
Yep, then what?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.642
I left.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.286
And where did you go?

29:50.350 --> 29:51.938
Liz, try to remember.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.898
I went to find Kaz.

29:54.704 --> 29:57.115
And what were you thinking?
Why did you want to find her?

29:57.135 --> 29:59.717
- I don't know.
- But you did find her?

30:01.471 --> 30:02.945
Yes.

30:05.557 --> 30:08.567
Could you tell me what
happened? Did you talk to her?

30:08.603 --> 30:10.191
I don't know.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.245
I remember the s...

30:14.653 --> 30:16.528
The smell of her blood.

30:16.653 --> 30:19.991
And I can see her lying there.

30:20.032 --> 30:22.784
And I'm sh... shaking.

30:27.045 --> 30:28.633
There's...

30:29.031 --> 30:32.190
there's something on the floor.

30:32.593 --> 30:34.113
Like, um...

30:34.610 --> 30:38.308
oh, it's like writing or a letter.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.937
- Overslept?
- No. I was searching every bin in the prison

30:47.963 --> 30:49.712
for that hoodie until
5:00 in the morning.

30:49.774 --> 30:51.889
Oh, yeah. I heard that
came up a dead end.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.187
- Vera?
- Mmm?

30:53.209 --> 30:55.086
- Can I have a word?
- Yep.

30:55.211 --> 30:56.498
Uh, in private.

31:00.593 --> 31:03.708
Hey, do you reckon
something's going on there?

31:04.079 --> 31:05.527
What? No.

31:05.652 --> 31:07.648
I don't know, he sent her those flowers.

31:08.609 --> 31:09.892
He did what?

31:10.017 --> 31:11.526
I had a peep at the card.

31:11.712 --> 31:15.248
Apparently when you're pregnant,
you're horny, like, all the time.

31:15.659 --> 31:17.205
Must be a real drag.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.226
It could be one of her delusions.

31:23.246 --> 31:25.869
She knew about the writing
on the floor. She was there.

31:28.601 --> 31:30.172
Liz is not a murderer.

31:31.796 --> 31:33.482
What if it's the medication?

31:33.518 --> 31:34.842
But you lowered the dose.

31:34.858 --> 31:36.264
I should have left her in Medical.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.288
I should have monitored
her for a few more days.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.064
- Did you lower the dose?
- Yes, yes.

31:42.579 --> 31:44.792
The drug company's
counting on this trial.

31:45.201 --> 31:47.667
- All that work could be for nothing.
- We still have to go to the police.

31:47.673 --> 31:51.277
Liz can't stand up to police
interrogation at the moment.

31:51.293 --> 31:53.206
She'll just respond
with confirmation bias

31:53.227 --> 31:55.322
- and then we'll never know the truth...
- OK, if we withhold this,

31:55.337 --> 31:57.271
and she was involved,

31:57.529 --> 32:00.317
the outcome will be
far worse for all of us.

32:04.092 --> 32:06.088
Dr Miller has explained
to us that sometimes

32:06.104 --> 32:08.064
your memory can play tricks.

32:09.693 --> 32:11.130
Not tricks.

32:11.353 --> 32:12.609
I forget.

32:12.734 --> 32:14.244
I've got dementia.

32:14.451 --> 32:15.723
I'm not crazy.

32:15.848 --> 32:19.560
But it's very important that we
establish exactly what happened.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.773
Try not to leave
anything out, all right?

32:21.810 --> 32:23.956
As long as you don't talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

32:24.582 --> 32:26.531
Detective, maybe I can help here.

32:26.588 --> 32:28.667
No, thanks. I've got this.

32:28.744 --> 32:31.812
Liz, I want you to tell
me about that morning.

32:31.813 --> 32:34.144
After you left the Medical Unit,

32:34.269 --> 32:37.019
you were taken back to
your cell by an officer.

32:37.060 --> 32:38.716
- Is that right?
- Not my cell, my unit.

32:38.736 --> 32:40.159
OK, then what happened?

32:43.774 --> 32:45.155
Liz?

32:47.720 --> 32:51.293
Liz, you said you remembered
leaving your unit to find Kaz.

32:51.319 --> 32:54.454
Yeah, that's right.
I needed to find her.

32:54.579 --> 32:57.178
- I was upset.
- Do you remember why?

32:58.197 --> 32:59.552
I felt guilty,

32:59.806 --> 33:02.780
'cause she'd been really good to
me and I had tried to hurt her.

33:02.795 --> 33:06.251
- What happened next?
- Mate, I'm trying to remember, yeah?

33:06.282 --> 33:10.212
So it's in there, but I
just can't get to it, OK?

33:13.103 --> 33:16.128
I can... I can see her lying there.

33:17.193 --> 33:19.314
And all the blood.

33:20.695 --> 33:22.964
And I can feel myself shaking,

33:22.990 --> 33:25.106
like my legs are just
gonna give out under me...

33:25.116 --> 33:26.904
But what happened before that, Liz?

33:26.941 --> 33:29.987
- What happened before that?
- I am trying to remember.

33:30.002 --> 33:32.248
The cameras. Do you
remember moving the cameras?

33:32.625 --> 33:35.588
Liz, did you do anything to the cameras?

33:35.614 --> 33:38.443
- Try to remember.
- Fuck, I am trying to remember!

33:38.474 --> 33:40.052
Fuck me!

33:40.177 --> 33:42.658
The... why... that's... I am.

33:43.025 --> 33:44.443
Sorry.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.868
We've been in there an hour.

33:49.946 --> 33:53.509
Look, she definitely saw
Kaz's body before I did.

33:53.634 --> 33:55.768
But Liz just isn't capable
of something like this.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.608
Well, what about that psychotic episode?

33:57.611 --> 33:59.405
You know, she could
have had another one.

33:59.436 --> 34:01.540
Liz isn't responsible.

34:01.613 --> 34:03.676
She might have been there,
she might have found the body,

34:03.697 --> 34:05.533
but there's no way
that she killed Proctor.

34:05.553 --> 34:07.079
Well, how can you be sure?

34:07.581 --> 34:10.967
Moving the cameras demonstrates
rational premeditation.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.052
Liz could only ever attack
Kaz in a psychotic state.

34:15.014 --> 34:16.984
There's no way that she did this.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.250
How was your interview?

34:24.426 --> 34:26.438
- Fine.
- No problems?

34:26.563 --> 34:28.149
- Why would there be a problem?
- Oh, I don't know,

34:28.159 --> 34:30.083
maybe 'cause you're
trying to hide something.

34:30.156 --> 34:31.656
Why did they re-interview you?

34:31.692 --> 34:33.399
You know, just different cops.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.996
It wasn't about Kaz.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.231
So what was it about?

34:37.733 --> 34:40.447
You haven't been able to look me
in the eye for the last two days.

34:40.837 --> 34:43.107
Did you speak to Stang before
she went into Protection?

34:43.143 --> 34:44.487
Fuck's sake, Ruby.

34:44.612 --> 34:47.094
Did you do something stupid? Did you?

34:50.125 --> 34:51.402
You tried to protect me.

34:51.878 --> 34:53.714
You made a fuckin' deal.

34:54.982 --> 34:56.248
Yeah.

34:57.117 --> 34:58.653
I made a deal.

34:59.522 --> 35:01.394
Tell me you didn't hurt Kaz.

35:01.420 --> 35:03.515
- Course I fuckin' didn't.
- So what did you do?

35:08.686 --> 35:11.086
I took Stang's charges.

35:12.146 --> 35:13.739
She told me about the smash and grab,

35:13.744 --> 35:15.451
and where she stashed some money.

35:16.087 --> 35:17.933
So I told the cops it was me.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.763
- Oh, why the fuck would you do that?
- For you.

35:21.559 --> 35:23.365
Once they finish the paperwork,

35:23.391 --> 35:24.538
Stang will be released.

35:24.549 --> 35:27.326
- She won't be a problem anymore.
- And you cop an extra year.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.078
No, maybe an extra six months.

35:29.093 --> 35:31.904
- You need to retract the statement.
- It's too late.

35:33.359 --> 35:36.307
You were getting out.
You were being released.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.756
- I can wait, sis.
- Oh, fuck's sake, Ruby.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.928
I put myself in here to keep you safe.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.488
I've been counting the fuckin'
days until you walk out.

35:43.540 --> 35:46.116
It was kill or be killed,
that's what you said.

35:46.923 --> 35:49.597
Now, you put your life
on the line for me.

35:50.202 --> 35:51.718
It's my turn to protect you.

35:51.749 --> 35:54.314
- I didn't ask for protection...
- You don't fuckin' have to!

35:56.718 --> 35:58.410
I'm your sister.

35:59.599 --> 36:00.902
It's done.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.707
Attention,
Compound. Attention, Compound.

36:07.723 --> 36:09.688
H Block are now called for dinner.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.152
We gotta be quick.

36:18.728 --> 36:20.698
Get down, Kosta!

36:23.563 --> 36:25.187
Hey!

36:26.161 --> 36:27.351
Gimme that.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.773
Hey!

36:29.332 --> 36:31.328
- You got any more up there?
- Nuh.

36:31.453 --> 36:32.693
Yeah, right.

36:38.967 --> 36:40.787
- They're not mine!
- Yeah?

36:40.912 --> 36:42.721
You can tell that to the cops.

36:44.951 --> 36:47.123
That's definitely not mine.

36:48.954 --> 36:50.774
You're fucked, Kosta.

36:53.153 --> 36:56.313
- It's nothing to do with me!
- Slot 'em both, OK?

36:56.344 --> 36:58.352
- Get the cops down here.
- I didn't kill the bitch!

36:58.376 --> 37:00.294
- Let's go.
- It had nothing to do with me!

37:00.613 --> 37:02.148
- Hey!
- It's not mine!

37:02.160 --> 37:04.821
- Let go of me, ya fuckin' bitch!
- I've never seen it before!

37:05.441 --> 37:07.013
Listen to me!

37:10.933 --> 37:12.319
Shit.

37:19.310 --> 37:20.883
Fuck!

37:22.357 --> 37:24.700
Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:32.949 --> 37:34.583
Oh, my God.

37:34.971 --> 37:36.570
You found it.

37:36.606 --> 37:39.692
They're questioning Kosta. It
was found with her drug stash.

37:39.693 --> 37:42.568
Shit! Well, how did you find her stash?

37:42.589 --> 37:44.006
It was an anonymous tip-off.

37:49.379 --> 37:51.101
I couldn't let you lag.

37:56.031 --> 37:58.514
She'd better go down for this.

37:59.057 --> 38:02.227
She deserves a fucking life sentence.

38:04.430 --> 38:05.951
Hey.

38:06.251 --> 38:09.639
Well, at least she won't be
pitching for Top Dog today, hmm?

38:18.358 --> 38:20.783
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:21.228 --> 38:22.904
Um...

38:28.086 --> 38:31.286
Kosta's been charged. She killed Kaz.

38:31.602 --> 38:34.198
- I know. Dr Miller told me.
- Oh.

38:34.233 --> 38:37.409
- I knew you didn't do it.
- Oh, thank God.

38:37.593 --> 38:39.857
- Hmm.
- God, I've got things in here

38:39.873 --> 38:42.143
that I cannot remember at all.

38:42.268 --> 38:44.229
What the hell's this one?

38:44.468 --> 38:47.567
"Ruby's the killer." What?

38:48.692 --> 38:50.883
That's not my writing.

38:51.925 --> 38:53.703
Hey? No.

38:54.239 --> 38:57.068
- Oh, this is bloody Kosta.
- What?

38:57.084 --> 38:58.636
Yeah, trying to trick ya.

38:58.823 --> 39:01.436
Stuck it in your memory
box, expecting you to lag.

39:01.449 --> 39:03.743
- You reckon?
- Yeah. It's bloody stupid.

39:03.763 --> 39:05.469
- Oh!
- Ruby didn't kill no-one.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.571
- Yeah.
- Bloody hell. Just chuck it.

39:07.622 --> 39:09.322
Hey, you wanna come to lunch?

39:09.342 --> 39:11.708
I thought maybe you
could go for Top Dog.

39:15.045 --> 39:16.661
Can you just stay for a sec?

39:16.662 --> 39:18.640
'Cause I wanna... I
gotta ask you something.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.489
Yeah?

39:22.351 --> 39:26.547
Like, things aren't... they're
not great for me at the moment,

39:26.805 --> 39:31.557
and if the new medication
I'm on doesn't work,

39:31.764 --> 39:35.960
- I, uh... I'm gonna... I'm gonna get worse.
- Why're you talking like this?

39:35.966 --> 39:37.848
Because, uh,

39:38.042 --> 39:40.311
one day, I...

39:41.572 --> 39:44.894
- I might need your help.
- Yeah? To do what?

39:45.101 --> 39:48.786
I don't... I don't wanna suffer, Booms.

39:48.911 --> 39:50.461
Oh. No.

39:50.494 --> 39:52.097
I know how this thing ends, right?

39:52.110 --> 39:53.267
- Nah.
- And it's not pretty.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.124
- See, you're not thinking straight.
- No, I am, love.

39:55.148 --> 39:56.932
- Come on. We're gonna be late for lunch.
- I am. No, no, no. No, love.

39:56.943 --> 40:00.342
Booms, love. Just... just... OK, listen.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.688
I need you to tell me that
you'll think about it, please.

40:04.244 --> 40:05.905
No.

40:06.274 --> 40:09.564
No. I don't need to think about it.

40:10.424 --> 40:12.371
You'll probably forget
about it tomorrow anyway,

40:12.391 --> 40:13.751
- so it doesn't...
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:16.528 --> 40:17.811
I won't, love.

40:19.192 --> 40:20.443
I won't.

40:24.752 --> 40:25.972
Hmm.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.119
Look, um...

40:29.603 --> 40:33.409
I might be getting me
parole real soon, OK?

40:34.247 --> 40:38.162
So, um, I probably won't even
be around anyway so, um...

40:39.558 --> 40:40.918
no.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.838
Sorry.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.296
- Will?
- Hey.

40:58.617 --> 41:00.225
I heard about Kosta.

41:00.277 --> 41:02.713
Yeah, well, she's
denied everything, but,

41:02.735 --> 41:04.735
- the evidence speaks for itself.
- Hmm.

41:04.860 --> 41:08.004
- So you were right about Winter.
- Yeah.

41:08.831 --> 41:10.701
I'm going to the dining
room. You wanna join me?

41:10.725 --> 41:11.950
Yeah, sure.

41:12.075 --> 41:15.519
There's, uh, talk of a Top Dog
vote. I wanna see how it plays out.

41:18.719 --> 41:21.181
Jesus Christ.

41:21.223 --> 41:22.582
Settle down.

41:22.635 --> 41:24.827
Hey, you OK?

41:26.704 --> 41:28.778
Kaz deserves payback.

41:32.109 --> 41:34.964
Kosta's gonna get the shit kicked
out of her when she gets back.

41:35.036 --> 41:37.502
Well, at this rate, she
might be our next Top Dog.

41:38.114 --> 41:41.108
I don't know, it feels weird if
someone's gotta take Kaz's job.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.996
If anyone's gotta do it,

41:43.529 --> 41:45.478
- Rita's the best we've got.
- Yes.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.834
Please don't start this again.

41:46.860 --> 41:49.601
Nah, the women are gonna need
someone. I mean, look at 'em!

41:49.622 --> 41:50.967
So why not you?

41:51.137 --> 41:53.656
They'll need someone who
can make the tough decisions,

41:53.661 --> 41:55.823
who can stand up to women like Kosta

41:55.869 --> 41:58.765
and who aren't gonna
run off from the screws.

41:58.890 --> 42:00.993
- Come on, Rita.
- Come on, love.

42:00.998 --> 42:02.229
Come on.

42:04.562 --> 42:07.964
- It's not for me.
- Well, it can't be bloody Kosta!

42:07.985 --> 42:09.302
What about Marie?

42:09.427 --> 42:11.102
Oh, what?

42:11.378 --> 42:14.315
- Oh, no, that's ridiculous, Allie.
- Why?

42:14.780 --> 42:16.524
I can't think of anyone better.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.530
OK, listen up!

42:18.543 --> 42:20.102
What?

42:20.154 --> 42:22.326
- Shut up.
- Everyone knew that Kaz and Marie

42:22.357 --> 42:24.369
- didn't see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, too right!

42:24.379 --> 42:25.895
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

42:26.401 --> 42:29.442
Kaz was a smart, tough...

42:29.867 --> 42:31.062
- Oh, bullshit!
- ... capable woman.

42:31.077 --> 42:32.091
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

42:32.463 --> 42:34.103
- No, she was.
- Cry me a river.

42:34.124 --> 42:36.600
- Marie is exactly the same.
- Yeah, no, she is.

42:36.838 --> 42:38.545
- Bullshit!
- I agree.

42:41.609 --> 42:44.422
- Oh, fuck off.
- Oh, yeah, this is gonna go well, for sure

42:44.547 --> 42:47.252
She cares about people,
just like Kaz did.

42:47.259 --> 42:49.938
She is a leader, just like Kaz.

42:50.407 --> 42:52.683
And she doesn't take
any shit from anyone.

42:52.808 --> 42:55.844
- Oh, you're fuckin' lying!
- That's why I want Marie representing me.

42:55.850 --> 42:57.402
No way!

42:58.301 --> 43:00.466
Well, what's your alternative? Kosta?

43:00.499 --> 43:02.678
A fucking murderer, sitting in the slot?

43:02.803 --> 43:05.406
She doesn't give a shit
about anyone but herself.

43:46.816 --> 43:48.729
What do you say?

43:50.287 --> 43:52.227
You up for it?

44:32.016 --> 44:37.485

44:41.422 --> 44:42.973
It's good to see you out.

44:42.999 --> 44:45.197
- You planted that hoodie.
- Is that any way to talk

44:45.204 --> 44:46.529
to your new Top Dog?

44:46.555 --> 44:48.689
It seems that a lot can
change very quickly in here.

44:48.721 --> 44:51.093
Another attempt to point
the finger away from you.

44:52.820 --> 44:54.817
Marie, what did the note say?

44:54.830 --> 44:56.459
Ruby is the killer.
