My name is Lemony Snicket

01:37.750 --> 01:39.041
a phrase which here means

"conveying this information to you while
being relentlessly pursued by the law."

02:09.041 --> 02:13.083
Being on the lam is a disheartening
and an uncomfortable way to live,

02:13.166 --> 02:16.500
not unlike being squeezed
into a tight, dark box...

02:19.375 --> 02:21.625
tossed at high speed
from a moving vehicle...

02:27.916 --> 02:30.250

02:30.333 --> 02:33.000
tormented by doubt
and unsure of where you are going,

02:33.083 --> 02:35.958
which, if you are on the lam,
is often the only way to travel.

Especially when their fire truck
ran out of gas deep in the Hinterlands,

02:46.833 --> 02:48.208

"a desolate place unlikely
to bring their troubles to an end."

02:53.125 --> 02:54.208

could be over this instant

07:03.000 --> 07:05.750
we stayed in a cave
full of hibernating bears,

my great love of fur.

Exactly, my pet.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.000
I called you "brother" and "sister"

09:19.083 --> 09:22.250
because we believe that
all people are brothers and sisters.

09:22.333 --> 09:25.083
Usually, brothers and sisters
share the same parents.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.500
Not always, brother.

you could possibly have.

13:35.708 --> 13:38.375
We can both talk.
We're a team of big-deal, snazzy doctors.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.250
You're a nurse. Plus, no one'll believe
you went to medical school.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.875
I could have gone to medical school.
I love cadavers.

13:43.958 --> 13:46.500
You got your master's in theater
and you picked the wrong costume.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.166
They'll believe
you went to medical school?

13:48.250 --> 13:49.291
Medical school?

13:49.375 --> 13:52.541
Dr. Medical School.

13:54.291 --> 13:59.958
Hello, I'm Dr. Mattathias Medical School,

14:00.041 --> 14:02.708
and these are my nurses, interns
or whatever.

14:02.791 --> 14:06.791
-Hello.
-Dr. Medical School, you say?

14:06.875 --> 14:09.125
I don't have you on my list.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.250
Goodness. Oh, dear.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.375
Oh, goodness me.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.958
What's wrong with this one?

14:26.333 --> 14:30.291
I have lists for visitors and staff
on my very important clipboard.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.791
If you're not on the list,
you can't come in.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.250
-Sounds like a paperwork mistake.
-Oh...

14:35.333 --> 14:36.833
[mumbling]

14:36.916 --> 14:38.791
[muffled] A paperwork mistake?

14:38.875 --> 14:44.291
Yeah. Okay. Yes.
That does make sense. Okay.

14:44.375 --> 14:47.500
Of course it is.
Here's my medical ID pass badge.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.208
Yes. Yes, that seems credible.

14:53.291 --> 14:56.791
Well, with the hospital
only half-finished,

14:56.875 --> 14:59.125
we have to be vigilant
about keeping out intruders

14:59.208 --> 15:01.083
like raccoons or murderers.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.708
I completely understand. I'm a doctor.

15:03.791 --> 15:07.666
Well, I guess it's okay to say,
"Welcome to Heimlich Hospital."

15:07.750 --> 15:12.000
I'm Babs, head of human resources
and hospital administration.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.750
I'm also head of party planning, so...

15:14.833 --> 15:16.458
Nice to meet you, Babs.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.500
I'm Dr. Thing That I Said Before.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.333
See you around the operating theater.

15:20.416 --> 15:21.625
You can't go yet.

15:21.708 --> 15:25.041
You'll need to sign and initial this form
in triplicate...

15:26.375 --> 15:29.500
-and the next 15 in quadruplicate.
-Quadru...

15:32.458 --> 15:36.416
How about I don't sign them
and you let me wander around anyway?

15:37.708 --> 15:40.791
Well, then I'd need
to call the authorities on you, mister.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.166
[clicks tongue] Of course.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.708
Paperwork makes the world go round.

15:48.791 --> 15:50.333
I thought money did that.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.333
Oh!

15:51.916 --> 15:52.916
You.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.291
[Babs chuckles]

15:59.458 --> 16:03.583
[Hal] Paperwork is the cornerstone of
what we do here at Heimlich Hospital.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.958
-[Violet] Not diagnosing?
-[Klaus] Or alleviating pain?

16:06.041 --> 16:06.916
[Sunny babbles]

16:07.000 --> 16:08.333
You couldn't do those things

16:08.416 --> 16:11.541
without first typing the details
on specialized forms,

16:11.625 --> 16:13.250
which must be on clipboards

16:13.333 --> 16:16.666
until it's time to file them
in special folders.

16:17.416 --> 16:21.291
Here is where the paperwork comes
to live forever

16:21.375 --> 16:24.541
and thus is the hospital's beating heart.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.208
I wouldn't show this to just anyone,

16:26.291 --> 16:28.833
but you look like people
I feel I can trust.

16:28.916 --> 16:31.916
-Well, it's very impressive.
-Thank you.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.958
I organized everything myself.

16:35.041 --> 16:39.291
Now, not only does Heimlich Hospital
store their information here,

16:39.375 --> 16:42.250
but people send me files
from all over the world.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.125
Why send it to a hospital?

16:44.208 --> 16:48.291
There's no safer place to store
information than at Heimlich Hospital.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.875
Why, you can find information
on everything

16:50.958 --> 16:52.458
from picture frames to pills,

16:52.541 --> 16:56.041
puddings to pyramids,
and that's just the "P" aisle.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.375
Think of everything we could learn
from these files.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.666
No, no, no.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.166
We file information, not read it.

17:03.250 --> 17:07.125
I don't wanna see you touching a file
unless you're putting it away.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.791
The information we hold here
is of the utmost importance.

17:11.375 --> 17:14.583
That's why I keep these cabinets
locked with my special keys.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.958
"Library of Records."

17:22.041 --> 17:25.666
I bet those brats are hiding there,
with their dumb noses in books.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.541
They're drawn to libraries
like a cat to catnip

17:28.625 --> 17:31.333
or a hobo to a dying possum.

17:31.416 --> 17:34.250
-Then the sugar bowl might be there too.
-We--

17:34.333 --> 17:37.833
It's very, very, very important to me.

17:37.916 --> 17:40.583
Yes, dear. I know.
You've mentioned it several times.

17:41.166 --> 17:44.916
Beatrice stole it from me.
I won't rest until it's stolen back.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.541
And if I don't get my hands
on the sugar bowl...

17:49.291 --> 17:50.500
I don't know what I'll do.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.541
-She's beautiful.
-And terrifying.

17:54.833 --> 17:58.958
This chute is where files go out,
but you won't use it much.

17:59.041 --> 18:02.958
Once paperwork comes into the library,
it rarely goes out.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.375
It hasn't been used in years.
It's probably full of spiders.

18:06.458 --> 18:10.250
Now, most of your work will involve
that chute over there,

18:10.333 --> 18:12.666
where the files come in.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.416
You may glance at the file,

18:14.500 --> 18:18.916
but remember to read
as little information as possible.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.208
For instance... [clears throat]

18:26.708 --> 18:29.250
I can tell you this file
has something to do with

18:29.333 --> 18:33.208
weather last week at Damocles Dock,
on the shore of a lake somewhere.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.541
So, I would unlock the cabinet for

18:35.625 --> 18:40.250
"D," "Damocles," or "W," "weather,"
or "L," "last week."

18:40.833 --> 18:43.041
Wouldn't it be difficult for people
to find the information?

18:43.125 --> 18:45.208
They wouldn't know whether to look
in "D," "W" or "L."

18:45.291 --> 18:47.041
They'd have to look in all three.

18:47.125 --> 18:51.000
The Library of Records has very strict
rules against checking out files.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.666
[knocking at door]

18:52.750 --> 18:54.833
[Mattathias]
I'd like to check out a child.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.458
I mean "file."

19:01.666 --> 19:02.916
And you are?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.958
Dr. Mattathias Medical School,
at your service.

19:06.041 --> 19:09.250
-Do you have credentials?
-Here's my medical ID pass badge.

19:14.125 --> 19:19.541
I'm doing important research on botulism
and I would like to consult some folders.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.083
What sub-department are you with?

19:21.166 --> 19:24.791
Did I say "botulism"?
I meant annoying little pimples.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.291
That sounds like a bona fide request.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.625
-A "bony" what?
-"Fide."

19:34.708 --> 19:36.583
I'd be more than happy
to show you our files.

19:37.750 --> 19:38.791
You would?

19:38.875 --> 19:43.000
File an application for folder clearance
to the hospital administration

19:43.083 --> 19:46.250
and wait seven to ten business days
for approval.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.333
-Oh, really?
-Yes, really. Now, goodbye.

19:58.041 --> 20:03.000
[as Olaf] He's obviously hiding them.
He could barely look me in the eyes.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.625
Maybe he has poor eyesight.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.416
Their filthy hands
are all over my sugar bowl.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.375
-What are we going to do?
-Plan number B.

20:11.333 --> 20:15.375
"Dr. Medical School." I've never heard
of anything so preposterous.

20:15.458 --> 20:16.416
Neither have we.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.458
Did you see his badge?
It looked hand-laminated.

20:19.541 --> 20:20.833
Listen, children.

20:20.916 --> 20:24.375
The Library of Records
must be protected at all costs.

20:24.458 --> 20:28.375
We cannot allow anyone unsavory
near our precious files.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.708
Do you understand? Of course you do.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.833
You're just like me.

20:32.916 --> 20:37.083
I never liked wandering down the halls
singing about diseases.

20:37.166 --> 20:41.500
That's why I wound up here,
happy with my files, my paperwork.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.791
And you're just the same, aren't you?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.458
No wonder I trust you completely.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.000
I'm going to file you under "M..."

20:51.083 --> 20:52.166
for "my friends."

20:52.250 --> 20:54.333
[loud thudding]

20:56.875 --> 21:01.041
There's nothing like the sound
of a file coming down that chute.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.958
-[Violet] It looks like a film.
-Yes, a lot of our files are films.

21:05.041 --> 21:08.291
We have projectors along the south wall
for anyone who wants to view them,

21:08.375 --> 21:10.291
but no one does
because no one's allowed.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.541
Could you excuse me?

21:11.625 --> 21:16.375
There're very specific instructions about
where to file anything labeled "Snicket."

21:19.041 --> 21:19.958
Wait here.

21:22.416 --> 21:23.708
Snicket, as in Jacques Snicket.

21:23.791 --> 21:26.666
-The man who was trying to help us.
-Who Count Olaf murdered.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.750
-Hal.
-Yes?

21:29.250 --> 21:30.500
We need to look at a file.

21:30.583 --> 21:33.083
[Hal] Our job is to file files,
not examine them.

21:33.166 --> 21:37.500
-This particular file is very important.
-It's a matter of life and death.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.833
Life and death? That does sound important.

21:40.916 --> 21:45.041
But rules are important too.
I'm sorry, children.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.625
[Babs over speaker] Attention.
This is Babs,

21:47.708 --> 21:50.291
head of human resources,
hospital administration

21:50.375 --> 21:52.333
and the party planning committee.

21:52.416 --> 21:53.625
Due to budget cuts,

21:53.708 --> 21:56.708
the cafeteria will be closing
in nine minutes,

21:56.791 --> 21:59.166
the gift shop in three minutes

21:59.250 --> 22:02.333
and the Library of Records
right this very second.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.416
Looks like you can't see that file
after all.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.958
-Ahh!
-[all scream]

22:28.041 --> 22:29.833
Oh! You scared us.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.916
I was practicing.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.458
Everyone, it's showtime.

22:32.541 --> 22:34.958
Take your positions at the X-ray Alcove
in Colon Corridor.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.125
That will force her
into the Leprosy Elevator Bank.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.666
Places, people, places!

22:38.750 --> 22:40.541
It's great you haven't given up
on theater.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.333
-Even though you can't audition...
-Seeing that you're dead.

22:43.416 --> 22:44.375
I said places!

22:45.458 --> 22:51.333

to Death is about to begin.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.583
You'll never get away with this.

26:10.666 --> 26:12.750
The paperwork alone
is beyond your abilities.

26:12.833 --> 26:14.041
Thank you, Babs.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.916
You certainly appreciate
all my hard work over these years.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.166
Greetings, Heimlich Hospital.

26:19.250 --> 26:24.000
This is Dr. Mattathias Medical School
with an emergency news bulletin.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.333
Some murderers have been spotted
in the hospital,

26:28.416 --> 26:32.833
so we will be conducting a thorough check
of each and every bed

26:32.916 --> 26:35.041
until they've been caught.

26:36.250 --> 26:40.541
After all, no one wants to be murdered
to death in their sleep.

26:40.625 --> 26:44.208
Good night and sweet dreams.

26:44.833 --> 26:46.833
He's taking over the hospital.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.166
We'll find somewhere in the hospital
they won't look.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.958
Can they still hear me?
Is there a button...

26:52.041 --> 26:53.916
Oh, here's the button.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.541
The unfinished wing.

26:55.625 --> 26:58.166
If there are no walls,
there can't be any security cameras.

27:03.291 --> 27:04.333
[muffled whimpering]

27:07.666 --> 27:11.416
-Find those orphans.
-Find the sugar bowl.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.750
-We'd better split up.
-Uh-huh.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.166
Come on, orphans, where are you?

27:30.750 --> 27:32.000
This way's clear.

27:37.708 --> 27:39.166
This hospital gives me the creeps.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.875
[Olaf] I don't care if it's dark
and scary. You are not coming back here

27:44.958 --> 27:49.083
until you've searched each and every ward
from acne to zinc deficiency.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.791
And stop waving into the camera.

27:54.791 --> 27:55.708
[exclaims]

28:03.291 --> 28:08.250
[hook-handed man] Baudelaires.
Baudelaires.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.125
Baudelaires.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.583
Oh, Baudelaires.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.375
Baudelaires.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.416
I hate boring television.

28:49.458 --> 28:51.833
[Olaf over radio] I see movement.
Turn left.

28:51.916 --> 28:56.000
Your other left. Your other, other left.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.000
[all scream]

29:02.916 --> 29:04.291
[panting]

29:08.041 --> 29:11.083
-You didn't find anything?
-No, and I looked really hard.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.541
No vending machine
in this hospital has parsley soda.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.666
They did have this hot brown stuff.

29:18.750 --> 29:19.625
[groans]

29:19.708 --> 29:22.291
It burns my insides,
but I've had three cupsful.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.375
It makes me feel alive.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.708
You should be looking for the orphans.

29:25.791 --> 29:29.625
I'm not one of your hench-people.
You don't pay me, so you can't yell at me.

29:29.708 --> 29:31.791
Actually, I don't pay them either.

29:43.833 --> 29:46.250
I would like to find the sugar bowl
and get out of here.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.000
The smell of hospitals depresses me.

29:48.083 --> 29:51.708
We're not leaving
until we find the Baudelaires.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.041
-[Klaus] Careful.
-[Violet] Good thing we're at a hospital.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.333
Watch your step, Sunny.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.750
Will this be the worst place
we've ever slept?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.416
[Klaus] At this point, it's hard to say.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.625
I did all the heavy lifting in Crow Town,

30:05.708 --> 30:09.208
I caught Babs,
I'm the one who looks great in a hat,

30:09.291 --> 30:11.125
so I'm going to retrieve
that sugar bowl

30:11.208 --> 30:13.208
while you stand around
staring at hallways.

30:13.291 --> 30:16.666
If you think you can do any better,
then be my guest.

30:16.750 --> 30:19.125
Fine. I'll just slip into something
more frightening

30:19.208 --> 30:20.750
and I'll have that sugar bowl.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.333
That's easier said than done.

30:23.708 --> 30:26.916
You haven't seen my outfit.
Move it, losers.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.458
I liked it so much better
before Yoko showed up.

30:30.958 --> 30:34.500
Just about everything in this world
is easier said than done,

30:34.583 --> 30:35.625
with the exception of

30:35.708 --> 30:38.416
"assisting Sisyphus's
cyst-susceptible sister,"

30:38.500 --> 30:40.458
which is easier done than said.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.916
[Lemony] Finding a safe place
is easier said than done.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.333
That's exactly
what the Baudelaires managed to do.

30:46.416 --> 30:51.541
Still, they knew by now
that safety is only temporary.

30:51.625 --> 30:54.625
We can't stay here all night.
Olaf is looking for us.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.000
We can't keep wandering
hoping things will get better.

30:57.083 --> 30:59.708
We're part of a mystery.
We'll never be free till we figure it out.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.625
Did you find anything
in Duncan and Isadora's notes?

31:02.708 --> 31:04.625
Just codes and poems.

31:04.708 --> 31:07.500
The damage from the harpoon gun
made them hard to decipher.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.291
We need to see that file.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.208
How can we get it?

31:10.291 --> 31:11.500
[babbles]

31:11.583 --> 31:12.916
We can't. Hal trusts us.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.666
And I studied the locks.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.833
They'd be difficult to pick
without equipment.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.958
We could steal his keys.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.375
Our parents would be disappointed.

31:28.458 --> 31:30.541
They'd know we were doing
what's necessary.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.583
Or they'd think we were criminals.
Like the newspaper says.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.750
It's a moral dilemma.

31:38.541 --> 31:42.166
[Olaf on speaker] Attention.
This is Dr. Mattathias Medical School.

31:42.250 --> 31:46.625
Bed searches will continue
until the murderers have been found.

31:47.666 --> 31:52.375
Also, if anyone in the hospital
has any valuables of any kind...

31:52.458 --> 31:55.416
Please bring them to
the human resources office immediately.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.333
-[both] Thank you.
-Thank you.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.208
[Hal] What nonsense.

32:00.166 --> 32:02.625
Murderers don't sleep at night.
They're wracked with guilt.

32:03.375 --> 32:06.000
Hal! Please be careful.

32:06.083 --> 32:09.875
Don't worry about me, child.
I have the balance of a blind cat.

32:09.958 --> 32:11.541
[board creaks]

32:11.625 --> 32:13.083
I can see that.

32:13.166 --> 32:18.291
I made you children some chicken soup
from an old family recipe.

32:18.375 --> 32:22.083
-Just the thing for a night like this.
-That's very kind of you.

32:23.208 --> 32:26.250
Let me take that.
How did you know we were here?

32:26.333 --> 32:27.916
You're just like me.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.375
I used to love to sleep under the stars
when I was a boy.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.333
We put up tents in our backyard.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.958
Mother and Father would help us
make s'mores over an open fire.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.291
Where are your parents now?

33:03.166 --> 33:04.000
They're dead.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.208
I'm sorry, children.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.625
I know how dark and lonely
the world must feel.

33:12.708 --> 33:14.625
But you can always
find a kind person

33:14.708 --> 33:17.375
who's willing to shine a light on you
when you need it.

33:17.458 --> 33:20.416
Eventually, you'll learn
to shine a light on others in need.

33:25.791 --> 33:27.708
[Lemony] This is not a show about me.

33:27.791 --> 33:30.416
But if it were, instead of telling you
how the Baudelaires

33:30.500 --> 33:32.875
were about to have an incident
in the library

33:32.958 --> 33:35.750
that gives me the heebie-jeebies
when I think of it at night,

33:36.333 --> 33:38.250
I might pause and tell you
about something I did

33:38.333 --> 33:40.333
many years ago that still troubles me.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.791
It was necessary, but not nice

33:43.875 --> 33:46.583
and even now, I get a pang of guilt.

33:46.666 --> 33:47.833
This doesn't feel right.

33:47.916 --> 33:51.583
[Lemony] Even now, I ask myself,
"Was it really necessary?"

33:52.166 --> 33:55.791
-[snoring]
-Was it absolutely necessary

33:56.625 --> 34:00.083
to steal that sugar bowl
from Esmé Squalor?

34:04.250 --> 34:05.625
What choice do we have?

34:05.708 --> 34:08.541
[Lemony] The Baudelaires were experiencing
similar pangs that evening

34:08.625 --> 34:12.791
as they were about to double-cross a man
who almost certainly didn't deserve it.

34:16.708 --> 34:21.208
What? Who? Yes, I may have
slipped off there for a sec.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.041
I suggest we all get some sleep.

34:25.041 --> 34:29.250
Paperwork awaits us in the morning.
Wait, where are my keys?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.666
Here. I'll put them in your pocket.

34:31.750 --> 34:35.250
So happy I found
trustworthy and loyal assistants.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.166
Never in my life did I think

34:37.250 --> 34:40.708
I would trust anyone
as much as I trust you three.

34:40.791 --> 34:43.500
Good night, children.
I shall file you under "P,"

34:43.583 --> 34:45.875
for "people I trust most in this world."

34:58.500 --> 35:00.541
-Good night, Hal.
-Good night, Hal.

35:09.333 --> 35:12.958
-I feel terrible about this.
-One day, we'll apologize and explain.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.041
[Klaus] Yeah.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.333
But until then?

35:27.208 --> 35:29.333
We better hurry.
Olaf could be watching right now.

35:29.416 --> 35:33.375
Hal had specific instructions about where
to file something labeled "Snicket."

35:33.458 --> 35:34.875
We'll start with "S."

35:39.958 --> 35:41.375
"Secretary to sediment."

35:41.458 --> 35:42.708
"Shed to sheepshank."

35:43.291 --> 35:44.541
"Shellac to sherbet."

35:44.625 --> 35:45.750
"Sludge to smoke."

35:46.291 --> 35:47.500
"Snack to snifter."

35:49.041 --> 35:50.333
That's the one.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.416
No Snicket.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.041
[babbles]

36:01.125 --> 36:02.416
It's worth a try.

36:12.083 --> 36:13.583
"Hackneyed to Haystack."

36:14.166 --> 36:15.250
"Index to Irony."

36:15.916 --> 36:18.041
"Jabberwocky to Jazzercize."

36:19.833 --> 36:21.041
That's the one.

36:38.208 --> 36:39.291
Nothing.

36:40.416 --> 36:43.000
I'm tired of not understanding
what's going on.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.083
-Missing files.
-Mysterious guardians.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.625
That tunnel that led to our house.

36:46.708 --> 36:47.708
[babbles]

36:49.833 --> 36:51.375
Do you think that could be it?

36:51.458 --> 36:53.708
We may not know what it stands for,
but it's important.

37:14.125 --> 37:15.916
[VFD agent] How's your brother?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.166
Dead or on the lam.
Either way, he doesn't mind.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.458
-[Violet] Jacques.
-I never thought we'd see him again.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.291
-Are we rolling?
-We're rolling.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.791
This is the debriefing of Jacques Snicket.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.916
Mr. Snicket, I need you to lay out,
in excruciating detail,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.291
what you know about Olaf,
this rash of fires,

37:30.375 --> 37:32.916
and anything we need to know
about the orphans.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.625
I should start at the beginning.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.833
But before I do,
I have an important update.

37:37.916 --> 37:40.666
There may have been
a survivor of the fire.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.625
Did he say...

37:45.708 --> 37:48.041
-Did you say--
-That's right.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.958
One of our parents could still be alive.

37:52.583 --> 37:55.666
I'm wild about movies.
Now, who wants popcorn?

37:58.125 --> 37:59.208
Go!

37:59.291 --> 38:00.541
[babbles]

38:01.166 --> 38:02.125
[Esmé grunts]

38:02.208 --> 38:04.250
Dang these stiletto heels!

38:11.916 --> 38:14.000
-We've gotta get out of here.
-Not without that film.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.041
Then we have to get it.

38:30.541 --> 38:33.625
I'm filing you under "S"
for "smashed flat!"

38:40.666 --> 38:44.416
You and Sunny head for the door.
I'll get the film and catch up.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.625
Peek-a-boo, I see you.

38:55.083 --> 38:55.916
[cabinet crashes]

38:57.125 --> 38:58.250
[yells in frustration]

38:59.375 --> 39:00.458
These shoes!

39:03.791 --> 39:06.500
The door's blocked. There's no way out.

39:10.458 --> 39:13.083
But you don't have to hide from me,
children.

39:13.666 --> 39:15.833
Maybe we can help each other.

39:15.916 --> 39:18.916
You see, I'm looking for something.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.625
Small, round...

39:25.333 --> 39:26.625
Full of secrets.

39:30.208 --> 39:33.625
Jacques Snicket thought
he could hide it from me.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.541
But now he's dead.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.208
[Klaus] We can make it to the mail chute.

39:38.083 --> 39:41.500
And I want it!

39:53.708 --> 39:54.958
I was thinking the same.

39:55.041 --> 39:57.041
[panting]

39:59.916 --> 40:01.250
-Did you get it?
-I got it.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.541
[Sunny babbles]

40:10.500 --> 40:11.375
Look out!

40:15.166 --> 40:17.250
-Violet?
-I'm okay.

40:20.375 --> 40:22.125
Esmé wants this. We can't let her have it.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.916
-I'll find you.
-I knew you had it!

40:33.166 --> 40:36.916
You're all alone, Violet.
How does it feel?

41:23.041 --> 41:26.208
The hardest part of life on the lam
is to keep moving,

41:26.291 --> 41:29.083
often in a direction
that seems wrong, dangerous

41:29.166 --> 41:31.416
or an agonizing combination of both.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.916
Sometimes, as in this moment
in the life of Violet,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.250
there simply isn't
any other choice to make,

41:37.333 --> 41:40.625
even if you end up regretting your actions
for the rest of your life,

41:40.708 --> 41:42.333
however short that may be.

41:43.541 --> 41:46.000
Give it to me!

41:46.083 --> 41:48.208
I will let you go. I promise!

41:48.791 --> 41:50.583
You're a terrible actress.

41:53.708 --> 41:55.583
Come to Mother.

41:56.583 --> 41:57.458
[grunts]

42:00.125 --> 42:02.125
Hello, hello, hello.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.750
Isn't it wonderful when we work together?

42:28.125 --> 42:29.416
[theme music playing]
