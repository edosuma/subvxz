WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.160
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.370 --> 00:05.420
Whoa!

00:06.430 --> 00:07.400
Whoa!

00:09.470 --> 00:11.770
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, sir.

00:11.870 --> 00:14.470
The Colonel must have input
new stargate locations into the computer.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.770
Jaffa number in the millions,
spread across the vastness of the galaxy.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.110
What you need right now is
a strong leader.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.200
You.

00:23.050 --> 00:26.610
Guys! We've got a problem.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.120
Ba'al's been busy.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.450
He's been gathering up stargates

00:29.560 --> 00:31.520
from all over the sector
for the last several weeks.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.460
In Arthurian myth,
Morgan was a powerful sorceress,

00:34.860 --> 00:37.800
King Arthur's half-sister
and an adversary of Merlin.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.260
That would suggest
she may have had a hand

00:39.370 --> 00:40.800
in the disappearance
of the weapon we seek.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.030
We're looking for the names of two
planets known on Earth in ancient times

00:44.140 --> 00:47.230
in the dialect of Old English
as Castiana and Sahal.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.370
<i>Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.</i>

00:49.480 --> 00:51.670
You're not really a hologram, are you?

00:51.780 --> 00:55.150
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:04.620
- What's the latest from the search parties?
- Nothing much to report, sir.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.020
The toxic atmosphere on Castiana
is slowing us down considerably.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.120
Now, we found evidence
of stone structures on Sahal,

01:10.230 --> 01:13.360
but they appear to have been abandoned
over 40,000 years ago.

01:13.470 --> 01:16.130
- So basically we've got nothing.
- Not yet.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.270
You went all the way
to the Pegasus Galaxy,

01:18.370 --> 01:21.540
had a face-to-face encounter
with a full-blown Ascended being,

01:21.640 --> 01:24.870
came away with not one
but two gate addresses,

01:24.980 --> 01:27.340
and they both turn out to be dead ends?

01:27.450 --> 01:30.280
Well, see, that's the part
that doesn't make any sense, sir.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.380
If Morgan didn't want us
to find Merlin's weapon,

01:32.490 --> 01:35.420
then why tell us anything at all?
We must be missing something.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.960
That's what Doctor Jackson
keeps telling me.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.620
You heard from Daniel?

01:39.960 --> 01:41.520
He checked in from Camelot this morning.

01:41.630 --> 01:45.660
He's convinced that the answer is
somewhere in Merlin's library.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.320
But he hasn't found anything yet.

01:47.430 --> 01:50.870
<i>HARRIMAN ON RADIO: Sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>General. You're needed in the control room.</i>

01:57.380 --> 01:58.740
What is it, Chief?

01:58.980 --> 02:01.110
We just received a heads-up
from NORAD, sir.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.280
An Al'kesh bomber just entered Earth's
atmosphere about four minutes ago.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.950
Bearing indicates Cheyenne Mountain.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.850
Two F-16's out of Peterson
have been re-routed to intercept.

02:11.960 --> 02:12.950
I'm patching us in.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.930
<i>PILOT: Repeat, you have entered</i>
<i>a Flight Restricted Zone</i>

02:15.030 --> 02:18.050
<i>and are requested to land immediately.</i>
<i>Please respond.</i>

02:23.940 --> 02:25.630
<i>Stargate Command, this is Bearcat One.</i>

02:25.740 --> 02:28.400
<i>Alien vessel is unresponsive.</i>
<i>Should we engage?</i>

02:28.510 --> 02:30.410
If they were friendly,
they wouldn't be flying silent.

02:30.510 --> 02:33.310
- Maybe their communications are down.
- We can't take the chance.

02:33.410 --> 02:35.180
Bearcat One, this is General Landry.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.510
You are clear to engage.

02:44.420 --> 02:47.290
<i>PILOT: The alien vessel has been disabled.</i>
<i>They're coming down hard.</i>

02:47.390 --> 02:50.330
I've got projected coordinates.
We're on it, sir.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.250
CARTER:
What's the situation, Major?

03:13.350 --> 03:16.410
The area has been secured.
No one on board except for the pilot.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.860
- He's being treated for minor injuries.
- Let's have a look at him.

03:26.930 --> 03:31.200
Ah, at last. The welcoming committee.

04:46.410 --> 04:47.680
MITCHELL: I don't get it.

04:47.850 --> 04:51.480
We know that Ba'al has come to Earth
before without being detected.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.150
Presumably by cloaked cargo ship

04:53.250 --> 04:55.850
or by using Asgard beaming technology
from high orbit.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.930
Exactly. So why would he fly
an Al'kesh directly to Stargate Command?

04:59.030 --> 05:00.760
Maybe he was planning to attack.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.690
- No. Even Ba'al's not that crazy.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.490
Well, this is interesting.

05:06.070 --> 05:09.260
There's a signal coming
from inside the interrogation room.

05:09.370 --> 05:12.300
He must have implanted himself
with a locator beacon.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.200
No doubt he's expecting his people
to beam him out at some point.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.610
- Better not hold his breath.
- Why not?

05:17.710 --> 05:19.040
Well, after the stargate was stolen
two years ago,

05:19.150 --> 05:21.170
we installed jamming devices
to prevent anyone

05:21.280 --> 05:23.720
from locking onto a signal
from within the base.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.750
MITCHELL: General. Has he said anything?

05:26.850 --> 05:29.820
Only that he won't talk
to anybody but SG-1.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.260
Lucky us.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.380
Well, frankly, I'm inclined to let him rot.

05:33.490 --> 05:36.490
That's all right, sir. We'll talk to him.

05:36.660 --> 05:39.030
After all, he did come all this way.

05:45.740 --> 05:46.970
Colonel Mitchell.

05:47.870 --> 05:49.970
Colonel Carter, Teal'c.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.310
Qetesh.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.410
She goes by Vala now.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.280
(SIGHING)
Always did, really.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.720
We've been authorized
to give you the time of day,

05:58.820 --> 06:01.310
- so make it quick and make it good.
- Of course.

06:01.590 --> 06:04.680
I understand your reluctance
to trust me, so I'll be succinct.

06:05.230 --> 06:07.630
It's the clones. They want me dead.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.060
- That would make all of us.
- Dead, huh?

06:10.330 --> 06:11.560
What'd you do?

06:11.670 --> 06:13.130
Short-sheet the bed? Cheat at cards?

06:13.230 --> 06:16.260
You must understand
that what I did was out of necessity.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.430
You were the ones
who invited the Ori into this galaxy.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.630
I was merely trying to preserve
a safe haven

06:20.740 --> 06:23.680
for myself and a few good friends.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.750
You mean slaves.

06:26.050 --> 06:29.020
So you stole a few stargates,
tried to set up your own network,

06:29.120 --> 06:30.780
yada, yada, yada.
We were there, remember?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.250
Luckily, I wasn't.

06:32.490 --> 06:35.350
I had to hear
about your heroics third-hand.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.950
I also had to hear
about how you thwarted my attempts

06:38.060 --> 06:40.530
to gain control of the Jaffa High Council.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.390
But none of this explains
why the clones would turn on you.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.760
That's probably because there's a little
more to his plan than he's letting on.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.840
Perceptive, as usual.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.430
Didn't Daniel tell me something
about a very powerful weapon

06:56.540 --> 06:58.940
in the hands of the Jaffa on Dakara?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.250
It's not a weapon, technically.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.680
It was a device
that was originally used by the Ancients

07:03.780 --> 07:05.680
to seed all life in this galaxy.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.150
But we did adapt it
to destroy the replicators.

07:08.260 --> 07:11.280
Using my simultaneous dialing program,
I might add.

07:11.930 --> 07:16.520
Am I correct in assuming that this device
can be adapted to kill organic life as well?

07:16.630 --> 07:17.760
Yes.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.520
- Now it's starting to make sense.
- It is?

07:21.670 --> 07:24.600
Well, you must remember
that I have intimate knowledge

07:24.700 --> 07:27.400
of just how depraved the Goa'uld can be.

07:27.510 --> 07:30.370
You are suggesting that Ba'al attempted
to gain control of the High Council

07:30.480 --> 07:32.410
in order to gain access
to the Ancient device.

07:32.510 --> 07:35.110
With the purpose of wiping out
all life in the galaxy,

07:35.220 --> 07:37.980
except his own little corner, of course.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.150
That was Anubis's plan.

07:41.090 --> 07:43.150
I never said it was original.

07:43.820 --> 07:48.590
But if I'd succeeded, the Ori would have
lost interest and been on their merry way.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.290
You were going to save the galaxy
by destroying pretty much everyone in it?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.230
But your clones figured out you weren't
going to bring them along, didn't they?

07:58.340 --> 08:00.140
They served their purpose.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.340
But what can I say? Their egos
were beginning to be a problem.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.610
Well, they are your clones.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.880
What I don't understand is,
after this particular revelation,

08:11.080 --> 08:14.110
you thought SG-1 would want to help you.

08:14.390 --> 08:15.380
Because I can help you.

08:15.890 --> 08:16.860
With what?

08:18.390 --> 08:20.950
Your search for Merlin's weapon,
of course.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.030
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

08:26.130 --> 08:28.570
Sir? Agent Barrett's here to see you.

08:28.870 --> 08:32.400
- Barrett. What can I do for you?
- I'm here for the prisoner, sir.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.410
Excuse me?

08:34.710 --> 08:35.680
Ba'al.

08:37.180 --> 08:41.340
I have an official request
for his transfer into NID custody.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.510
You gotta be kidding.

08:46.290 --> 08:48.450
We caught him. We can handle it.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.090
Well, with all due respect, sir,
it's my understanding

08:51.190 --> 08:53.850
he basically flew himself
into your front door.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.700
Look, nobody wants
a jurisdictional tug of war here.

08:57.860 --> 09:00.260
We've been investigating
the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust

09:00.370 --> 09:04.240
for two years now.
I'm telling you, it's a global conspiracy.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.170
Political and corporate connections
in over a dozen countries,

09:08.280 --> 09:10.040
your prisoner is at the top of the pyramid.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.110
We don't even know if he's the real Ba'al.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.700
Even if he's a clone,
I bet you he's got enough information

09:14.810 --> 09:17.110
to bring down the whole organization.

09:17.380 --> 09:18.440
We could wipe them out.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.540
Well, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

09:20.650 --> 09:23.120
Right now, we've got bigger fish to fry.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.490
Anubis told me of the weapon
and of its power.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.790
He dedicated considerable effort
to finding it during his time

09:30.900 --> 09:33.920
in our plane of existence,
but he never succeeded.

09:34.430 --> 09:36.430
And you have the address?

09:36.540 --> 09:38.830
Actually, you have the address.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.770
It's among those Colonel O'Neill obtained
during his encounter

09:41.880 --> 09:47.210
with the Ancient repository of knowledge
on the planet you call P3R-272.

09:47.510 --> 09:49.480
There are thousands of addresses
on that list.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.140
Exactly why you'll never find it
on your own.

09:53.950 --> 09:55.820
I, however, have information
that will allow you

09:55.920 --> 09:58.250
to narrow down
your choices considerably.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.490
All I ask in return is
that you eliminate the clones.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.500
And we do that exactly how?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.830
It should be easy enough
to track them down.

10:06.930 --> 10:09.700
I implanted a locator chip in each one
when I created them.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.200
That's funny, because we detected
a locator chip in you.

10:14.010 --> 10:17.270
I had to implant one in myself
in order to gain their trust.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.780
You can use the tracking system
on board my Al'kesh.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.400
They'll never see it coming.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.880
Well, that is a truly incredible story,

10:26.650 --> 10:27.950
in every sense of the word.

10:28.050 --> 10:31.750
I should also mention that every one of
my clones knows about Merlin's weapon.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.420
And if any of them, at any point,
were captured by the Priors,

10:34.530 --> 10:37.020
and were it to somehow slip out

10:37.130 --> 10:41.090
that the SG-C computer contains the
location of a weapon deadly to the Ori...

10:41.200 --> 10:44.800
Their Priors would stop at nothing
to have it within their grasp.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.630
It is, of course, your decision.

10:49.010 --> 10:52.470
I leave it in your very capable hands.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.650
You can't seriously think
that he's telling the truth.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.820
The whole truth? Of course not.

11:07.430 --> 11:10.400
But there's too much at stake here
not to investigate.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.590
And in the meantime?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.430
What am I supposed to tell my superiors?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.590
That's your problem.

11:19.570 --> 11:24.640
We managed to activate the
tracking system on the Al'kesh, and this

11:25.880 --> 11:27.040
is what we got.

11:28.850 --> 11:32.440
- Those are the Ba'als?
- More like dots, really.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.450
Get it? Dots, balls.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.380
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:40.090 --> 11:43.390
Anyway, we worked up those files
with the current locations,

11:43.500 --> 11:46.430
showing the addresses
and any available intel.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.600
All right, so what kind of trap
are we looking at?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.360
I don't think it would be
as simple as an ambush,

11:50.470 --> 11:52.200
not while we have him in custody.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.400
No Goa'uld would sacrifice himself
like that.

11:54.510 --> 11:57.270
- What do you think, sir?
- I say we give it a go.

11:58.010 --> 12:01.110
Remind me to give you a primer
on the meaning of the word "sir."

12:01.210 --> 12:02.940
But she's right.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.980
We won't know if Ba'al is serious or not

12:05.090 --> 12:07.520
until we test out some of these addresses.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.120
Some of this intel seems pretty sketchy.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.050
I'm familiar with this planet.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.530
- It used to belong to Camulus.
- Can you get us in?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.290
Absolutely.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.240
You sure you want to bring her along
on this one?

12:25.340 --> 12:27.500
Jackson says she'll be useful.
Now's her chance to prove it.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.800
But Dr. Jackson isn't here,
and it seems to me

12:29.910 --> 12:31.770
he's the only one she ever listens to.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.740
Yeah. Some of the time.

12:34.110 --> 12:35.950
You don't think you can control her?

12:36.050 --> 12:37.140
No, I know I can't control her,

12:37.250 --> 12:39.510
but that's pretty much par for the course.

12:40.190 --> 12:43.250
Sir, Carter and I are the same rank,

12:43.720 --> 12:45.490
Teal'c's an alien, Jackson's a civilian.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.460
I learned a long time ago
I don't control anything.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.930
Who does?

13:01.510 --> 13:04.410
- How do I look?
- Turn around.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.270
Yeah, you look great.

13:07.710 --> 13:10.740
A little more enthusiasm
from you next time. Thank you.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.380
- What?
- Zat!

13:14.450 --> 13:16.290
This is my first real mission
through the gate,

13:16.390 --> 13:18.410
and I'm the only one
who knows the terrain.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.460
Then try not to get us killed.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.260
Here we are.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.700
And what?

13:34.410 --> 13:36.380
Well, it's a ring platform,
somewhat hidden,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.240
but it's a backdoor, if you will.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.680
Okay, but it doesn't do us much good
if we can't activate it.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.910
Leave that to me.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.480
Hang on.

13:45.350 --> 13:46.320
Hang on!

13:48.390 --> 13:49.750
Where's she going?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.330
(WHISTLES)

14:08.540 --> 14:09.700
(GROANING)

14:18.990 --> 14:21.750
- What the hell are you doing?
- I alerted a Jaffa patrol to our presence.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.980
Obviously! Do you mind if I ask why?

14:24.090 --> 14:26.890
So they'd sound the alarm
and send reinforcements.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.290
Oh, well, that's...

14:28.390 --> 14:29.360
That's brilliant!

14:29.830 --> 14:30.960
Hey, how come I didn't think of that?

14:31.060 --> 14:34.430
My dear Colonel, where do you think
the reinforcements will come from?

15:04.260 --> 15:06.100
You can thank me later, by the way.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.750
(PIN CLANGING)

15:39.470 --> 15:40.430
Jaffa!

15:42.800 --> 15:43.860
(JAFFA GROANING)

15:46.740 --> 15:47.970
Don't shoot.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.200
I know why you're here,
and you're making a big mistake.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.780
Oh, let us guess, you're the real Ba'al.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.040
Precisely.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.510
No doubt the impostor promised you
the location of Merlin's weapon

15:59.620 --> 16:01.310
if you helped him get rid of the rest of us.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.450
That's right.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.750
You do realize he has no idea
where it is or how to find it.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.830
- VALA: But you do.
- Of course.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.660
I obtained the information
only after the clones were created

16:10.760 --> 16:14.460
and needless to say,
I never shared it with them.

16:14.770 --> 16:17.760
You know what?
This is giving me a headache.

16:18.170 --> 16:21.770
What do you say
we finish this up at home?

16:23.180 --> 16:24.800
Let's go, Spartacus.

16:35.090 --> 16:37.990
Oh, yeah. Now I can see the difference.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.350
I still cannot.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.030
Do we really believe only one of them
knows how to find the weapon?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.120
This is Ba'al we're talking about.

16:47.230 --> 16:50.900
I don't think we can take anything
either of them say at face value.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.060
So what now, sir?

16:53.410 --> 16:55.870
We've got scientists working here,
don't we?

16:55.980 --> 16:58.940
Get them on this.
See if they can sort out who's who.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.620
In the meantime,
I think I'm going to have to arrange

17:12.730 --> 17:14.920
for separate accommodations.

17:20.230 --> 17:21.930
ANALYST: I wish I had better news.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.600
So you're saying
there's no way to tell them apart?

17:24.700 --> 17:27.900
We generated distinct DNA profiles
of all four samples,

17:28.010 --> 17:29.600
using a number of analysis techniques.

17:29.710 --> 17:30.900
Sorry? Four?

17:31.010 --> 17:32.570
We did the host
and the Goa'uld separately.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.110
- Right.
- We ran each test five times,

17:35.250 --> 17:37.770
and in each case,
the results were uncanny.

17:37.950 --> 17:41.320
There was a perfect match
across all 13 specific DNA markers.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.090
I'm sorry, Colonel.

17:43.190 --> 17:46.780
Either the clones are genetically
indistinguishable from the real Ba'al...

17:46.890 --> 17:49.920
Or we have two clones on our hands
and the real Ba'al is still out there.

17:50.030 --> 17:53.000
- Yep.
- Thank you.

18:07.650 --> 18:09.640
So much for not encountering resistance.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.220
I guess some Ba'als are bigger
than others, huh?

18:12.620 --> 18:13.950
If he's got a ship back there,
we're screwed.

18:14.050 --> 18:15.150
We've got to find a way around.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.350
- You hold this position. I'll go.
- I'll come with you.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.890
Let's draw some fire.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.930
You thinking what I'm thinking?

18:41.780 --> 18:43.110
CARTER: Someone's coming.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.830
(SCREAMING)

19:01.830 --> 19:02.990
Don't shoot.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.530
I am the real Ba'al.

19:07.370 --> 19:08.340
Sam, we got Ba'al.

19:08.770 --> 19:09.760
Copy that.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.080
So do we.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.660
Chief, got a full count.
Two strikes, three Ba'als.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.130
That's clever, sir.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.500
He was thinking that one up
the whole way home.

19:39.610 --> 19:42.100
- Yeah, the whole three seconds.
- Three point two.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.200
Good point.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.500
Well, that ties you with SG-12,

19:44.610 --> 19:46.700
because they brought in two more
about an hour ago.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.780
Damn.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.210
- It's not a competition.
- Says you.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.390
General.

20:01.890 --> 20:04.360
Barrett. I was wondering
when you'd be back.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.700
I understand you got yourself
a few extra Ba'als.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.300
I don't suppose you'd consider
letting me take a few off your hands?

20:12.410 --> 20:14.200
You know I can't do that.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.100
Not until we figure out
which one's the original,

20:17.210 --> 20:20.340
and whether or not he's bluffing
about Merlin's weapon.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.540
Besides, if any of them got wind
that we had another agenda,

20:24.650 --> 20:27.280
that would give them leverage
in the interrogation.

20:27.390 --> 20:31.850
Last thing we need is for them to think
they have a strong bargaining position.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.030
I was afraid you were going to say that.

20:34.130 --> 20:37.650
- I assume you spoke to your superiors.
- I did. They're not happy.

20:37.760 --> 20:42.220
The fact is, while the NID does provide
civilian oversight of my command,

20:42.340 --> 20:45.430
I don't, technically,
have to follow their orders.

20:45.570 --> 20:48.130
At least not until the President tells me to.

20:48.370 --> 20:51.940
They tried that.
For the moment, he is backing you.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.670
But if your investigation doesn't turn up
anything useful soon,

20:54.780 --> 20:55.910
it's gonna all change.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.310
Obviously.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.520
I'd like to stay on
and observe the interrogations, sir.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.450
Any one of them could say something
that might turn out to be useful for us.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.990
Of course. You're always welcome.

21:06.490 --> 21:07.460
What do you got?

21:07.730 --> 21:10.960
Well, sir, SG-14 just arrived
with two more Ba'al clones,

21:11.060 --> 21:13.790
which brings us to the end of our list.

21:14.270 --> 21:17.070
Well, you guys got your work
cut out for you, huh?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.520
And just how might you be
able to help me?

21:37.320 --> 21:39.790
Well, we could spare your life, for one.

21:40.730 --> 21:44.630
You help us find Merlin's weapon,
and I promise, we won't kill you.

21:44.830 --> 21:45.800
No.

21:46.270 --> 21:47.790
Instead, you'll lock me in the basement

21:47.900 --> 21:51.670
of one of your more appalling
penal facilities

21:51.770 --> 21:55.210
for me to live out the rest of my life
in squalor and deprivation.

21:55.570 --> 21:58.200
It's better than the alternative. Trust me.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.940
You see, here's what I'm thinking.

22:00.050 --> 22:02.980
I'm thinking that you're not the real Ba'al.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.270
I mean,
you haven't even tried to cut a deal,

22:04.380 --> 22:07.840
which makes me think that you have
no idea how to find the weapon,

22:07.950 --> 22:11.120
therefore you're just another clone.

22:13.430 --> 22:16.590
I am the real Ba'al, I assure you.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.760
No, no, think about this.
How did we meet?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.400
Do you think the real Ba'al
would let himself be captured like that,

22:23.500 --> 22:26.630
cowering in the bushes
like a scared little bunny rabbit?

22:28.840 --> 22:29.810
That's better.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.070
But I'm still not buying it.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.840
You're trying to goad me
into revealing information.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.920
No, I'm just calling it like I see it.
And right now, you do not strike me

22:40.020 --> 22:42.250
as someone who could intimidate
a 10-year-old out of his lunch money,

22:42.360 --> 22:44.320
much less run an interstellar empire.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.720
Why don't you have the guard
excuse himself for a moment,

22:46.830 --> 22:49.390
and I'll show you
just what I am capable of?

22:49.630 --> 22:53.120
See, now I know you're not the real Ba'al.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.320
The real Ba'al wouldn't care
about the guard.

23:07.110 --> 23:08.440
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

23:20.430 --> 23:21.390
So,

23:23.700 --> 23:25.530
having a tough day, are we?

23:25.660 --> 23:27.130
What do you want, Qetesh?

23:27.230 --> 23:30.200
- Is that any way to greet an old friend?
- Is that what we were?

23:30.300 --> 23:32.360
I'll admit we had our differences.

23:32.610 --> 23:35.300
You attacked my fleet at Selenis,
crippled my flagship,

23:35.410 --> 23:37.970
and killed 10,000 of my best Jaffa.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.510
So I did.

23:40.510 --> 23:42.310
But it was nothing personal.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.020
Anyway, that's all in the past,

23:45.220 --> 23:46.180
and I'm here

23:46.620 --> 23:48.050
to talk about our future.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.680
"Our" future?

23:51.420 --> 23:54.290
Well, you must admit there's always been
something between us.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.660
Even when we wanted to kill each other,

23:57.160 --> 23:59.060
there was always a certain

24:00.770 --> 24:01.820
spark.

24:02.130 --> 24:03.100
Perhaps.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.000
But you've made your
new allegiance clear.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.070
Have I?

24:09.240 --> 24:12.210
Or have I just been waiting
for the right opportunity?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.980
What sort of opportunity?

24:19.190 --> 24:20.910
You know how to find the address.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.450
I have the access to the database.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.590
You would betray your Tau'ri friends?

24:28.060 --> 24:29.620
Friends

24:30.260 --> 24:32.560
come and go.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.130
Besides, what use
are they going to be to me

24:34.230 --> 24:36.670
on their knees
before the armies of the Ori?

24:37.340 --> 24:38.460
You tell me what you know,

24:38.570 --> 24:40.060
I'll find the location of Merlin's weapon,

24:40.170 --> 24:42.230
we'll make our escape.

24:43.210 --> 24:47.110
And then we'll be free to share
in the pleasure of each other's company.

24:48.410 --> 24:49.710
An excellent plan.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.080
But why wait?

24:54.150 --> 24:56.640
Merlin's weapon isn't going anywhere.

24:56.890 --> 24:58.580
We have nothing but time.

25:01.860 --> 25:06.060
What, here
on this rather uncomfortable table?

25:06.500 --> 25:07.520
Why not?

25:07.970 --> 25:10.160
Well, the security camera, for starters.

25:10.270 --> 25:14.330
There's no way they'd trust me
after seeing something like this.

25:15.810 --> 25:18.970
Tell them it was part
of your interrogation technique.

25:20.610 --> 25:22.440
Oh, come on, be serious.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.710
I am being serious.

25:29.420 --> 25:30.390
Aren't you?

25:32.460 --> 25:35.890
<i>BA 'AL: Your time amongst the Tau'ri</i>
<i>is making you soft.</i>

25:36.260 --> 25:38.560
<i>You used to be a much better liar.</i>

25:38.660 --> 25:40.330
Don't say it.

25:40.430 --> 25:43.460
- Your people are getting nowhere, sir.
- You think you can do better?

25:43.570 --> 25:45.090
It's what we're trained for.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.230
I could have half a dozen agents here
by tomorrow.

25:47.340 --> 25:50.540
I'm talking about offering
our services on your investigation.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.840
If any of the Ba'als knows
where Merlin's weapon is, we'll find out.

25:52.950 --> 25:56.180
By your own admission, the NID wants
this over with as quickly as possible

25:56.280 --> 25:59.410
so they can move on to something
they think is more important.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.850
Under those circumstances,
I think you'll understand

26:01.950 --> 26:04.420
why I'd prefer to stick
with my own people.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.560
Yes, sir.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.440
- Mind if I join you?
- Please.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.140
So,

26:26.510 --> 26:28.640
how are the interrogations coming?

26:29.210 --> 26:30.550
You have to ask?

26:31.350 --> 26:34.180
Look, I know you've been monitoring
the investigation.

26:34.290 --> 26:35.980
I also know you think
we're wasting our time.

26:36.090 --> 26:39.920
No. No, I never said that.
Not in so many words.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.790
Look, you guys are fighting a war
out there, right?

26:42.900 --> 26:44.450
We're fighting it down here.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.200
Believe me, it's a war.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.030
Do you remember two years ago,

26:49.130 --> 26:50.970
when the Goa'uld almost took over
the Russian government?

26:51.070 --> 26:52.830
- Do you want to see that happen again?
- Of course not.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.030
Then help me.

26:54.140 --> 26:57.230
Malcolm, it's not like we're gonna
keep the Ba'als here forever.

26:57.340 --> 27:00.680
Just give us a couple of days,
and then you can come in and...

27:00.780 --> 27:03.180
Days. No, this is way too important!

27:07.290 --> 27:09.910
- Are you all right?
- This is about us, isn't it?

27:10.020 --> 27:11.720
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, this is about us.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.990
We obviously have unresolved issues.

27:14.290 --> 27:17.730
Look, you're my friend,
and I care about you.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.220
But don't push it.

27:27.670 --> 27:29.440
I need to see the prisoner.

27:31.210 --> 27:32.180
Now.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.560
(GRUNTS)

27:54.830 --> 27:57.360
- General.
- Somebody give me some good news.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.470
Sorry, sir,
I still don't have anything useful.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.670
I didn't even make it to first base.

28:01.970 --> 28:02.960
Where's Colonel Carter?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.600
She was finishing up last time I saw,

28:04.710 --> 28:06.470
but I don't think she has anything
to report either.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.550
We're running out of time.
The NID wants the prisoners,

28:09.650 --> 28:12.740
and the President's not going to be able
to hold them back forever.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.720
Or they're not going to wait.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.680
- What are you talking about?
- Agent Barrett.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.450
He's talking to one of the Ba'als.

28:21.630 --> 28:23.860
I didn't give authorization for that.

28:24.860 --> 28:25.830
Whoa!

28:28.530 --> 28:29.630
(GUN FIRING)

28:30.070 --> 28:31.040
Radio.

28:31.970 --> 28:35.410
This is Colonel Carter
requesting backup, Level 16, Corridor B.

28:35.570 --> 28:37.240
Come with me. You, cover both.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.930
(ALARM SOUNDING)

28:45.720 --> 28:47.410
We're losing containment.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.340
This is General Landry.

28:51.460 --> 28:55.890
I need a full security lockdown
of Levels 15 through 17. Now.

28:56.030 --> 28:59.120
And there goes the feed. We're blind.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.840
- Barrett.
- Oh, Sam.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.420
He got away, he took my gun.

29:22.790 --> 29:25.020
- It's okay, we'll get you out of here.
- Okay.

29:27.860 --> 29:28.830
Come on.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.330
BA'AL: Going somewhere?

29:35.170 --> 29:36.400
(BOTH GRUNTING)

29:37.700 --> 29:38.930
(BARRETT GRUNTING)

29:40.810 --> 29:42.500
Put them with the others.

29:48.150 --> 29:51.510
We have emergency forces in position
at all access points, sir.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.110
All three levels are locked down
and secure.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.260
What do you got for me, Doctor?

29:59.490 --> 30:03.430
Well, we're thinking
our best bet is symbiote poison

30:03.530 --> 30:06.120
introduced in gas form
into all three levels.

30:06.370 --> 30:07.390
It won't harm any of our people,

30:07.500 --> 30:10.060
but it will kill any of the Goa'uld
who come in contact with it.

30:10.170 --> 30:11.470
Excellent. Do it.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.540
Well, it's not that simple. You see,

30:13.640 --> 30:16.540
we'll have to use the ventilation system
to distribute the gas,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.370
and, you know, it's not really designed
for that sort of thing.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.450
What are you saying?

30:20.550 --> 30:23.070
I can run some simulations

30:23.180 --> 30:25.650
and determine the optimum
points to seal off the levels

30:25.750 --> 30:29.350
and to insert the gas.
But even at optimum efficiency,

30:29.450 --> 30:31.150
it won't be distributed evenly.

30:31.260 --> 30:34.280
There's bound to be dead pockets
where the gas will take longer

30:34.390 --> 30:35.620
- before it has any effect.
- All right, all right.

30:35.730 --> 30:36.920
So what you're saying is,

30:37.030 --> 30:39.460
depending on location, some of the Ba'als
may get advance warning, sir.

30:39.570 --> 30:42.190
As soon as they realize what's happening,
they're going to kill the hostages.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.000
Then we must be prepared
to provide a distraction

30:44.100 --> 30:45.870
at the moment the gas is released.

30:45.970 --> 30:46.940
Go!

31:06.890 --> 31:09.220
Get up. We don't have much time.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.840
Remember, we can't afford to be seen
until Dr. Lee gives us the signal.

31:20.940 --> 31:21.910
Got it.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.780
No improvising this time.
We stick to the plan.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.110
Despite the fact that my improvisations
have been extremely useful in the past?

31:28.210 --> 31:29.840
That's your entry point.

31:38.690 --> 31:39.750
Bring her.

31:56.410 --> 31:58.340
The access code. Please.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.540
You're trying to download the list
of planets from the Ancient database.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.030
What are you doing?

32:52.300 --> 32:54.030
We need to join the others.

32:57.270 --> 32:58.240
All right.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.740
I'm coming.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.550
You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

33:20.660 --> 33:25.460
A weapon capable of destroying
not only the Ori, but the Ancients as well.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.430
I'd say that's a pretty valuable commodity.

33:29.230 --> 33:30.430
I won't do it.

33:34.570 --> 33:39.410
This would be an inappropriate time
for heroics, Colonel.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.780
Go ahead and kill me.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.110
It's only a matter of time
before we regain control of this level.

33:45.220 --> 33:48.080
Good luck trying to figure out
the code before then.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.350
I would never dream of killing you.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.290
But I will kill the other hostages.

33:56.290 --> 33:58.060
You start with Agent Barrett.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.130
Wait.

34:09.070 --> 34:10.170
I'll do it.

34:20.390 --> 34:21.580
I'm in position, Doc.

34:21.690 --> 34:25.590
<i>SILER ON RADIO: Level 14, Section C-9</i>
<i>on the ventilation grid.</i>

34:26.060 --> 34:28.250
All right. That's our main access point
on the north side.

34:28.360 --> 34:32.320
Now, the first thing you'll need to do
is seal off the vent before the junction.

34:33.370 --> 34:34.420
I'm on it.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.070
Why is this taking so long?

34:42.170 --> 34:43.870
It's a lot of information.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.710
You did something to slow
the download, didn't you?

34:46.810 --> 34:48.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:49.510 --> 34:52.110
Well, it doesn't matter.
You can't stop us anyway.

34:53.490 --> 34:56.150
Check the perimeter.
They'll be coming soon.

34:56.350 --> 34:57.580
(COCKING GUN)

35:19.110 --> 35:20.580

35:35.830 --> 35:37.060
(WHISPERS)
Teal'c. Vala.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.290
We got a bit of a dead end here.
You got Carter's 20?

35:40.400 --> 35:43.800
Negative. I am similarly immobilized.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.310
Doctor.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.940
We're setting up
five separate access points,

35:55.050 --> 35:57.480
they all have to be
ready to go simultaneously.

35:57.580 --> 35:59.640
It's just going to take a minute.

36:10.130 --> 36:13.260
- I'll take that.
- It won't do you any good.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.930
They'll never let you off this base,
even if you kill us all.

36:16.030 --> 36:17.930
Yes, that's what I wanted you to think,

36:18.040 --> 36:20.800
otherwise you never
would have given me the code.

36:21.870 --> 36:23.430
What are you talking about?

36:23.540 --> 36:25.510
I knew they wouldn't negotiate.

36:26.550 --> 36:28.380
Not even for you.

36:29.950 --> 36:32.380
Not with something like this at stake.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.650
Fortunately,

36:37.420 --> 36:39.250
that's not the plan.

37:10.690 --> 37:11.710
Where the hell is that gas?

37:12.320 --> 37:14.090
I don't mean to rush you, boys.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.290
We're about to be discovered here.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.460
BA'AL: We know you're back there.

37:20.570 --> 37:21.550
So much for the plan.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.320

37:28.070 --> 37:29.100

Forget about a coordinated attack.

Just hit them with as much gas
as you can. Now!

- We are uninjured.
- And Mitchell?

38:38.840 --> 38:39.900
You okay?

38:40.480 --> 38:42.780
- I'm fine. What's happening?
- We got them on the run.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.040
It looks like they're retreating back
to one of the isolation rooms.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.980
Wait a minute. All of them together?

38:47.090 --> 38:48.450
Yeah. Why?

38:49.620 --> 38:50.590
Sam?

39:12.410 --> 39:13.540
(GRUNTS)

39:19.050 --> 39:20.020
Sam?

39:23.490 --> 39:27.420
- You're too late. That's symbiote poison.
- You're the one who's too late.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.370
Get us out of here.

39:56.390 --> 39:58.020
How the hell did he do it?

39:58.120 --> 40:01.420
It looks like the locator beacons
actually served a dual purpose.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.150
In close proximity, they combined
to amplify the signal enough

40:04.260 --> 40:05.960
to be picked up
through our jamming screen.

40:06.060 --> 40:08.400
That's why he needed us to go
and round up all the clones

40:08.500 --> 40:10.870
and bring them here.
He was playing us from the start.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.770
This was all so that he could get his hands
on that list of planets.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.740
He must genuinely believe that
Merlin's weapon is hidden on one of them.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.540
Even so, he took a great risk.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.540
It was only because Agent Barrett
violated protocol

40:20.650 --> 40:23.770
that he was afforded the opportunity
to escape the interrogation room.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.470
And that was the reason
he was able to get all the clones

40:25.580 --> 40:27.280
in one place so that he could beam out.

40:27.390 --> 40:29.350
So if the whole thing
was planned in advance,

40:29.450 --> 40:32.390
how did he know
what Agent Barrett was gonna do?

40:38.500 --> 40:41.490
Agent Barrett, we need to talk.

40:41.900 --> 40:42.870
Yes?

40:43.870 --> 40:45.300
Did you read the report
on Ba'al's attempts

40:45.400 --> 40:47.530
to gain control of the Jaffa High Council?

40:47.640 --> 40:48.660
Yeah, sure I did.

40:48.770 --> 40:52.300
The council members were influenced
by some form of mind control.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.600
Yeah, I remember. So?

40:53.710 --> 40:55.440
So what were you doing in Ba'al's cell?

40:55.550 --> 40:56.640
I wanted to question him.

40:56.750 --> 41:00.120
- You had no authorization for that.
- You were stonewalling me.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.380
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

41:02.490 --> 41:04.750
You took your weapon
into the interrogation room.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.830
Yeah. Yeah, I shouldn't have done that.
That was a mistake.

41:07.930 --> 41:09.090
See, the Malcolm Barrett I know

41:09.190 --> 41:10.660
would never have made
that kind of mistake.

41:10.760 --> 41:14.060
Your record indicates your entire career
has been strictly by the book.

41:14.170 --> 41:18.260
Now, suddenly out of the blue,
you're a cowboy?

41:19.500 --> 41:20.630
What are you guys saying?

41:21.210 --> 41:22.940
You think that I've been brainwashed?

41:23.310 --> 41:27.440
The technology is readily available
to the Goa'uld who infiltrated the Trust,

41:27.550 --> 41:29.780
and their loyalty is to Ba'al.

41:30.050 --> 41:33.180
CARTER: Somebody must have given him
the specs to our anti-beaming technology.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.340
It's the only way he could've known

41:34.450 --> 41:36.580
that a combined signal would be
enough to punch through.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.660
Yeah. I agree with that, but it wasn't me.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.720
Ba'al's plan hinged on knowing in advance

41:40.830 --> 41:43.620
he'd have the opportunity
to get out of that cell.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.860
- He knew you were coming.
- And this is crazy.

41:46.970 --> 41:48.960
You didn't know
you were doing anything wrong.

41:49.070 --> 41:51.190
I've got to go. I'm due back in Washington.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.460
You're not going anywhere.

41:52.570 --> 41:53.540
Sergeant!

41:54.040 --> 41:55.530
Hand over your weapon.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.710
Sam, you know this isn't true.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.220
Sir, I'm sorry.
I should never have given Ba'al that code.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.690
You had no way of knowing.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.790
Under the circumstances,
you did the right thing.

42:20.730 --> 42:21.990
Thank you, sir.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.670
So what do you think?

42:34.380 --> 42:37.780
Think Ba'al really has a way
of figuring out where that weapon is?

42:37.880 --> 42:39.010
Hard to say.

42:39.150 --> 42:43.090
Anubis knew the addresses
of all those planets, and he never found it.

42:43.990 --> 42:46.290
Mind you, there was only one of him.

42:48.030 --> 42:48.990
Says you.
