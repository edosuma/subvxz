05:43.218 --> 05:46.303
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.182
Thank you. Well, good morning.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.060
Deposit.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.237
Another nice deposit.

06:03.405 --> 06:07.116
- You and Sally are in the right business.
- I'm in a hurry, please.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.000
Hi, Kate.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.291
Have you cleaned the house across the way?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.626
I haven't had time yet.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.920
You should always do that one first.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.012
Anne!

07:58.311 --> 08:02.565
Come here.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.402
Did you ever see that kid
out there before?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.946
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.281
Send Joe in.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.449
Joe.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.874
Hello, Pretty Boy.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.382
Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.260
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.247
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.334
You want me?

09:03.501 --> 09:06.212
What's the idea
of throwing that stone, huh?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.048
Any law against throwing stones?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.884
Oh, you're tough, huh? Come here!

09:15.555 --> 09:18.474
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway? Huh?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.436
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

09:22.896 --> 09:27.274
What for? What do you want? Huh?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.569
Just wanna talk to her.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.989
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.493
You live around here?

09:38.286 --> 09:41.247
- Huh? In Monterey?
- Salinas.

09:41.623 --> 09:42.915
What's your name?

09:43.792 --> 09:46.752
You're not talking, huh? Now, look...

09:46.920 --> 09:49.004
...why are you following Kate around?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.839
What's the idea, squirt?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.926
Any law against following
around the town...

09:55.303 --> 09:56.887
...madam, whatever you call her?

09:57.055 --> 10:00.224
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.518
She owns that house over there too,
don't she?

10:02.686 --> 10:05.938
But don't you go hanging around there,
squirt. You're too young.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.399
Now come on. Now beat it.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.234
Well, is that her real name?

10:10.402 --> 10:11.402
Huh?

10:11.820 --> 10:16.240
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.285
Well, what's her last name?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.830
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.707
Huh?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.503
Well, you tell her I hate her.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.030
I should have gone right on in there.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.867
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.517
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.228
- You know what girls in class call him?
- No, what?

11:28.396 --> 11:29.938
- The Prowler.
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.024
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.484
- Promise me.
- Why not?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
Please don't. I don't want you...

11:37.322 --> 11:38.906
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.574
Hello, Cal.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.118
Excuse me for talking.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.579
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.289
- Do you wanna come?
- What icehouse?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.666
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.127
He's been talking about it
every night for the last week.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.837
Dad gonna be there?

11:54.005 --> 11:56.006
Why, sure, he's gonna buy it.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.468
Well, I'll skip it.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.429
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.349
Come on.
Hey, Aron.

12:05.517 --> 12:09.144
Yeah?
Why don't you ask me where I've been?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.562
Would you tell me?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.024
No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.196
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.490
He was worried.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.742
Yeah, I bet.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.579
Well, you gonna come or not?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.709
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

12:33.044 --> 12:37.005
He's coming.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.515
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.268
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.855
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.106
Mastodon?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.488
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

13:05.076 --> 13:06.743
This is my son, Cal.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.747
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

13:10.915 --> 13:13.459
...to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.254
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.797
Well, times change.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.802
Well, as I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.054
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.308
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.811
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.646
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.816
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.653
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.115
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

13:45.283 --> 13:50.329
...some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress, uh...

13:50.497 --> 13:52.831
...for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.210
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

13:56.377 --> 14:00.255
So lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.926
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

14:04.093 --> 14:07.679
...as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.848
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.475
Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
Hello.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.851
Hello, son.
Hi, Dad.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.980
Now my son, uh, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.149
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

14:19.317 --> 14:21.485
...and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

14:21.653 --> 14:24.738
...and it still came out fresh and good. Right?
- Quite right, son.

14:24.906 --> 14:29.117
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
- Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

14:30.745 --> 14:34.081
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.916
Where?
New York City.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.876
And they can't raise them there.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.462
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.841
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.386
Yeah.
It's about time. Well?

14:48.763 --> 14:52.057
Well, I read in the Monterey newspaper...

14:52.225 --> 14:55.102
...that if we get into this war...

14:55.270 --> 14:57.938
...there are gonna be some fortunes made.

14:58.189 --> 15:02.651
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.572
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.284
Beans are up to 3 cents.
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.369
And they keep too, don't they?

15:12.537 --> 15:16.415
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.255
Look here, Will.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.300
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.552
...but I know I have an idea here.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.306
I come from a family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

15:32.473 --> 15:36.310
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea
and the only one that ever made a dime.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.562
You wanna make a profit,
you plant beans.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.690
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

15:44.902 --> 15:49.531
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.200
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.161
I don't understand him. I never have.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.039
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.336
Help me up.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.759
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.510
- No, Cal.
- Oh.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.263
It's dark in here and spooky.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.141
Why is he so alone all the time?

16:16.309 --> 16:19.394
He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.564
Dad's made a wonderful buy,
hasn't he? We'll freeze vegetables.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.816
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.693
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

16:27.070 --> 16:30.489
- Oh, I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.076
Well, naturally, he's your brother. He's scary.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.828
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.247
Sort of like an animal.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.166
I don't know, he scares me.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.586
- Aron, when are we gonna get married?
- Hm?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.131
Oh, just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.051
Oh, I wish it... I wish it was right now.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.846
- So do I.
- Do you?

17:03.481 --> 17:05.607
Abra. Abra.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.150
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.861
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.739
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.017
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.937
- I hope so.
- You are.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.398
A perfect one.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.944
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

17:51.487 --> 17:54.072
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.534
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.289
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

18:02.457 --> 18:05.083
- Ha-ha-ha. Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.169
No, he isn't.
Yes, he is too.

18:07.420 --> 18:12.007
Let's move over here. Aron. Aron!

18:21.642 --> 18:24.811
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

18:25.730 --> 18:29.274
Oh, Abra. Abra.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.152
I love you, Aron.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.322
Really, I do. Really.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.909
Sure. I love you too.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.639
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.641
What are you doing? Stop it!

19:05.144 --> 19:08.480
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.190
...whose sin is covered.

19:11.192 --> 19:15.028
Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

19:16.697 --> 19:19.074
...and in whose spirit there is no guile."

19:20.910 --> 19:22.869
And you are forgiven, Cal.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.958
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

19:28.125 --> 19:30.377
...only something I do not know.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.840
Why did you push that ice down?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.011
I don't know.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.389
Was it?

19:43.266 --> 19:46.393
Was it vengeance? Anger?

19:47.228 --> 19:50.939
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

19:51.649 --> 19:52.816
What was it?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.529
I wanted to see it
slide down the chute.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.492
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.870
No, it's for Cal to read.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.163
Start at the fifth verse.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.749
Verse 5.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.021
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.857
I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

20:34.025 --> 20:36.484
...and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

20:36.652 --> 20:38.153
Go on.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.284
Six.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.578
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.247
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

20:49.624 --> 20:53.585
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.754
And surely in the floods of great waters...

20:55.922 --> 20:59.090
...they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

20:59.258 --> 21:01.801
- Seven.
- Not the numbers, Cal.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.889
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble...

21:06.057 --> 21:09.893
...thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

21:11.520 --> 21:14.648
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

21:14.815 --> 21:16.232
Through and through, bad.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.194
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.665
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.709
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.003
Well, it's true.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.881
Aron's the good one.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.008
I guess there's just a certain amount...

21:42.176 --> 21:44.094
...of good and bad you get
from your parents...

21:44.261 --> 21:46.596
...and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.181
Cal, listen to me.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.850
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.269
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.981
That's where he's different from an animal.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.027
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

22:07.785 --> 22:08.910
My mother...

22:13.541 --> 22:15.709
...she's not dead and gone to heaven...

22:16.794 --> 22:17.794
...is she?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.339
Why do you ask that?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.717
She's not dead at all.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.679
She's not buried in the east
like you said either.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.472
She's alive.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.891
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.518
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.270
He was just passing through.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.858
How come you told Aron and me she died?

22:40.151 --> 22:42.569
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

22:48.492 --> 22:52.037
If she... If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

22:52.204 --> 22:55.206
I have no idea. She went east.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.791
How do you know?

22:57.334 --> 23:01.588
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

23:02.506 --> 23:04.090
...I heard she went east.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.218
What was she like? Was she bad?

23:08.012 --> 23:10.138
I guess she...

23:11.057 --> 23:14.601
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.103
There was something she seemed to lack.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.982
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.195
I never knew what she was after.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.406
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that either.

23:28.574 --> 23:32.077
She was so full of hate.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.121
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.961
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

23:42.713 --> 23:43.713
No.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.257
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.015
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.892
I've told you, Cal.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.938
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.109
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

24:05.528 --> 24:08.780
She had the most lovely hands.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.323
Like ivory.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.618
She took such good care of them.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.329
Her mother had arthritis.

24:16.497 --> 24:19.707
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.674
Talk to me, Father.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.306
I gotta know who I am.
I gotta know who I'm like.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.766
I gotta know...

24:38.352 --> 24:39.602
Where is she?

24:40.563 --> 24:43.022
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

24:43.858 --> 24:46.151
...after she left, I never heard from her.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.780
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.158
If you leave this room now,
we may never be able to talk again.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.828
You coming home tonight, Cal?

24:56.996 --> 25:00.039
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.750
Good evening, Cal.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.254
High-strung. Very high-strung.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.549
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

25:09.758 --> 25:11.885
He's waiting for you.
Ah, good.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.304
What do you suppose he meant by that?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.278
Go on, beat it!

25:32.406 --> 25:34.282
Your wife has called up three times.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.369
My wife's a...
I know she is. Now beat it.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.672
Joe!

25:54.428 --> 25:57.180
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.182
Mr. Hawks.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.605
What do you want?
- I want, uh...

26:05.773 --> 26:09.275
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.205
Hey!

26:23.123 --> 26:25.667
Where's my drink?
All right.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.253
That's not very neat, is...

26:29.088 --> 26:30.171
It's okay.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.634
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

26:34.802 --> 26:36.928
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.514
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

26:39.682 --> 26:42.600
Only Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.769
You can tell him if you want to.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.481
You're just a kid, ain't you?

26:49.650 --> 26:52.193
- I'm older than you are.
- Sure, but that isn't...

26:52.361 --> 26:53.903
Hey!
All right.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.614
Kid, please...

26:56.782 --> 26:58.950
...you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.744
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.331
There's Joe.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.669
Look, kid, please go.
You don't wanna get yourself hurt.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.798
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.760
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

27:25.185 --> 27:28.271
- Hey. Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

27:28.439 --> 27:31.482
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.318
I gotta go now, kid.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.819
Is she nice?

27:35.321 --> 27:36.654
Don't let Joe see you, please.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.073
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

27:39.241 --> 27:42.076
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.829
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.540
What's the matter, kid?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.876
She had pretty hands. Did you see them?

27:50.044 --> 27:52.211
- Hands?
- Did you look at them?

27:52.379 --> 27:55.590
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.220
Where is she?

28:01.388 --> 28:03.181
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.225
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

28:06.393 --> 28:08.019
Back that way.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.479
Will you show me?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.777
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.613
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.616
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.867
No, honest.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.912
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.206
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.583
If I step out of line,
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

28:30.751 --> 28:34.921
Come on. Come on, will you?

28:35.297 --> 28:37.131
You can just show me where the door is.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.258
Come on.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.595
Be a sport.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.225
Come on.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.324
There's the door.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.743
Thank you. You can go back now.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.329
What are you gonna do?

29:08.497 --> 29:10.373
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.874
Shh!

29:13.001 --> 29:17.839
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

30:10.601 --> 30:13.728
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.523
I gotta talk to you.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.989
Joe? Joe!

30:25.699 --> 30:29.368
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

30:31.997 --> 30:34.707
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

30:35.375 --> 30:38.878
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

30:39.588 --> 30:41.297
Get him out of here!

30:41.465 --> 30:43.716
I wanna talk to her!

30:52.601 --> 30:54.977
I wanna talk to you! I wanna talk to you!

30:55.812 --> 30:59.023
I wanna talk to you! Talk to me!

30:59.191 --> 31:02.735
Talk to me, please! Mother!

31:04.655 --> 31:07.698
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.076
No, I guess there isn't.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.036
Here.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.248
Put this on your cheek. Here.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.296
Drink some coffee.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.967
How'd you find out about Kate, anyway?

31:26.134 --> 31:28.970
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

31:29.137 --> 31:31.722
The one they call Rabbit?

31:32.266 --> 31:35.518
I thought so. He never was any good.

31:35.686 --> 31:38.688
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

31:39.690 --> 31:43.734
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.657
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

31:49.825 --> 31:52.118
Yes, there is. I'm the law.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.245
Get that through your head.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.123
Shut up!

32:03.338 --> 32:06.549
Does Adam know that you...

32:06.717 --> 32:08.759
...roam around over here at night?

32:13.015 --> 32:16.142
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

32:16.310 --> 32:18.603
...way back in his ranch days.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.898
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

32:23.483 --> 32:26.485
...that you might find out something
about Kate.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.364
But then she was over here on the bay...

32:30.532 --> 32:33.326
...and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.910
So I figured it'd be all right.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.913
You think he'll ever
find out about her?

32:38.332 --> 32:40.625
He'd never come over here.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.673
Here. You might as well look at this now.

32:47.841 --> 32:51.636
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.139
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.937
I knew it.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.858
Oh, I knew it was true.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.863
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.910
How did you know it was true?

33:16.078 --> 33:19.246
Because she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.041
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.217
I hate her.

33:31.593 --> 33:33.803
And I hate him too.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.223
Come on, I'll take you home.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.934
You don't have to drive me home.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.436
I know I don't have to take you home!

33:43.689 --> 33:44.814
Here.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.401
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.152
Come on now.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.584
How did Dad meet her?

34:06.920 --> 34:08.629
Where'd she come from?

34:09.547 --> 34:12.091
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.219
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

34:16.388 --> 34:21.684
Of all the people...

34:22.768 --> 34:24.311
How come he married her?

34:24.938 --> 34:27.606
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.984
Young and full of spirit.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.777
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.905
He's not a worldly man.

34:44.498 --> 34:48.335
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.505
How come?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.341
I don't know.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.971
Did he do something to her?

34:59.806 --> 35:01.307
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.809
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

35:04.311 --> 35:08.647
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.779
He must have done something to hurt her.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.198
No. No, sir.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.659
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

35:23.914 --> 35:26.373
You see, your father has more kindness...

35:27.000 --> 35:30.795
...and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

35:41.765 --> 35:45.643
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.671
It's going to work...

36:13.839 --> 36:16.882
...if only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.144
It's going to work.

36:45.245 --> 36:48.497
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.008
All right, bring her on. Come on.

37:02.554 --> 37:06.140
Now do you think it'll work? Ha-ha-ha.
It sure will!

37:25.577 --> 37:28.078
Good morning, Mr. Trask.
Good morning.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.250
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.628
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.004
It's this war in Europe.

37:37.172 --> 37:40.674
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

37:40.842 --> 37:42.718
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.470
Is that where you're loading?
- Yeah.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.347
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.973
It's this war in Europe.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.274
Cal!

38:02.322 --> 38:05.115
- Do you know where Aron is?
- Uh...

38:05.367 --> 38:07.242
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.661
Can I do something for you?

38:08.828 --> 38:11.956
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.791
What have you got there?

38:13.959 --> 38:17.711
Oh, well, I figured it would save some time.
So I...

38:18.338 --> 38:21.966
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.676
Yep.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.220
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

38:26.388 --> 38:27.972
...and are working so well, Cal.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.848
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

38:35.188 --> 38:38.315
Think you better
have your lunch now. It's time.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.860
Hi, Cal.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.824
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.786
- Well... Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.967
Lydia, vamoose.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.232
He'll be here in a minute.

39:20.400 --> 39:24.028
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours too if you like after this.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.738
No, thanks.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.992
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
Who?

39:34.914 --> 39:37.207
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.255
Girls follow you around, don't they?

39:43.423 --> 39:46.383
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.427
Who is she?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.431
I never saw her before in my life.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.185
I'll bet.

39:59.022 --> 40:02.232
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

40:02.984 --> 40:04.485
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

40:04.652 --> 40:07.321
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.114
Just about all he's got.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.825
I like your father.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.078
Do you?

40:18.833 --> 40:21.543
I threw away about $3,000 once.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.170
Yeah?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.799
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

40:26.966 --> 40:28.675
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.345
At least my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.890
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.936
I reckon it would.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.730
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.398
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

40:46.194 --> 40:49.863
You forgave him because you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

40:50.031 --> 40:51.740
- That's right.
- You forgave him?

40:51.908 --> 40:53.283
That's right. Ha-ha-ha.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.536
Is there an egg in this basket?

40:57.163 --> 41:00.791
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.628
Girls love their fathers terribly.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.505
Do they?

41:07.715 --> 41:09.466
My mother died when I was 13...

41:09.634 --> 41:12.761
...and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

41:12.929 --> 41:14.847
No, I didn't know that.

41:16.057 --> 41:19.351
- Are you interested in hearing about me?
- Yeah.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.608
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.361
I just hated everybody.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.239
I used to sit and just glare at people...

41:32.407 --> 41:35.159
...or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.330
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

41:40.957 --> 41:44.376
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.837
And I thought nobody in the world loved me.

41:48.798 --> 41:51.049
And it was awful.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.221
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

41:57.640 --> 42:00.350
...so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.770
I thought you'd like that.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.982
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

42:09.152 --> 42:10.652
They tried.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.238
What'd they do to you?

42:13.406 --> 42:16.158
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.869
But I felt he shouldn't have
punished me at all.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.497
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.041
But he didn't.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.127
Isn't it funny?

42:28.046 --> 42:29.963
I'm grown up now...

42:30.131 --> 42:32.633
...but I still understand kids
better than I do grownups.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.884
You're not so grown-up.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.053
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.804
I'm very grown-up.

42:37.972 --> 42:41.433
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

42:44.145 --> 42:46.647
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

42:47.357 --> 42:48.941
...I felt better.

42:56.449 --> 42:58.200
Now we get along fine.

42:59.369 --> 43:03.247
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

43:03.414 --> 43:06.375
...but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

43:10.129 --> 43:13.632
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

43:14.467 --> 43:17.636
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

43:30.358 --> 43:33.610
Why, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

43:34.570 --> 43:36.863
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.700
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.038
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.211
My, your hair's in a mess.

43:54.841 --> 43:56.717
Hey, Dad, what's that?

43:56.884 --> 44:00.137
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.306
Aron! I brought your lunch.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.100
Looks like a coal chute.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.644
Coal chute?

44:11.232 --> 44:13.859
Okay, woman, where's the beans?
Cal!

44:17.155 --> 44:20.324
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

44:20.491 --> 44:23.785
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

44:31.336 --> 44:34.629
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

44:34.797 --> 44:37.341
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.593
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

44:43.139 --> 44:45.349
Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.602
What'd you say?
I said, it's a good idea if it works.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.146
It's gonna work because it's gotta work.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.398
It's gotta work because I said so.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.444
Well, if it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.905
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.911
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

45:08.956 --> 45:11.291
Good luck, Adam.

45:44.826 --> 45:47.786
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

45:47.954 --> 45:50.414
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

45:50.581 --> 45:52.582
Oh, sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.918
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.921
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.715
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.884
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

46:03.052 --> 46:04.719
...and about time he learned to drive it.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.347
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

46:07.515 --> 46:09.099
Well, now pay strict attention, boys.

46:10.476 --> 46:11.560
Don't touch that!

46:11.727 --> 46:13.270
Wait till it's explained to you.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.897
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

46:16.065 --> 46:20.235
Now, the power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

46:20.403 --> 46:23.947
...and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

46:24.115 --> 46:27.868
...through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.662
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

46:30.830 --> 46:33.832
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.877
This here's the ignition key.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.505
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please?

46:40.882 --> 46:43.842
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

46:44.010 --> 46:45.969
- See where it says "bat"?
- Oh, yes, yes.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.556
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

46:50.016 --> 46:51.475
Thank you. Thank you very much.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.101
First you gotta retard the spark.

46:53.269 --> 46:56.521
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

46:56.689 --> 47:00.275
- Oh, now remember that.
- Now, this here is the spark.

47:00.443 --> 47:03.403
You push her way up. Listen.

47:05.114 --> 47:08.158
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

47:08.910 --> 47:12.245
- You had lessons before.
- No, no, I just saw you do it.

47:12.413 --> 47:15.916
- Oh. You're a smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

47:16.125 --> 47:18.543
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.921
Now, this here is the crank.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.216
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

47:24.383 --> 47:27.135
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.678
Push in till she catches.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.180
See how my thumb is turned down?

47:30.348 --> 47:31.890
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

47:32.058 --> 47:34.809
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

47:34.977 --> 47:36.895
...she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

47:37.063 --> 47:40.982
Oh, dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.817
- That's wrong way around.
- How's that?

47:42.985 --> 47:46.571
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

47:47.031 --> 47:50.116
You pull out this choke,
turn her around to suck gas in.

47:50.743 --> 47:52.786
Then you give her a hard spin.

47:53.162 --> 47:56.414
- She caught, first time!
- Oh! Caught on what?

47:57.250 --> 47:59.042
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.795
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.755
So there you are.

48:03.923 --> 48:06.383
Indeed. Now, isn't that wonderful?

48:06.551 --> 48:09.010
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

48:09.178 --> 48:10.178
That's the easy part.

48:10.346 --> 48:12.097
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

48:12.265 --> 48:14.766
Spark up, gas down.
Spark up, gas down.

48:14.934 --> 48:16.226
Switch to bat.
Switch to bat.

48:16.394 --> 48:19.104
- Crank to compression, thumb down.
- Crank to compression, thumb down.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.106
- You got that? Let's have it again.
- Uh-huh.

48:21.274 --> 48:23.275
Spark up, gas down.
Spark up, gas down.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.569
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

48:25.736 --> 48:28.613
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.449
Can see water running out of the cars.

48:44.380 --> 48:47.382
Well, it's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

48:47.550 --> 48:51.094
- Someday somebody'll prove it.
- Dad.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.597
- It was your idea.
- No.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.558
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.479
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

49:03.232 --> 49:06.735
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.904
Aw, you don't understand him.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.908
You can't go in there.
I gotta see Will Hamilton.

49:14.076 --> 49:16.286
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.455
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

49:18.623 --> 49:21.541
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

49:21.709 --> 49:25.086
Right, left. Right, left.

49:25.421 --> 49:36.181
Right, left. Right, left.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.559
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

49:52.198 --> 49:53.948
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.742
We better have a look.

49:57.912 --> 50:01.206
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.793
Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
Hello, Cal.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.753
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.338
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

50:08.506 --> 50:09.506
Yeah. I had to see you.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.508
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.927
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

50:14.095 --> 50:16.930
Let's get out of here
before they start up that pianist again.

50:17.098 --> 50:20.308
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.686
- I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.688
No, I gotta.

50:25.398 --> 50:28.566
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

50:28.734 --> 50:29.943
...you ought to raise beans?

50:30.111 --> 50:32.237
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

50:32.405 --> 50:34.614
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.866
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.827
I don't see any way out.

50:38.994 --> 50:42.414
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

50:42.581 --> 50:46.042
Well, see, that's why I wanna go into beans.

50:46.502 --> 50:50.088
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.882
Oh. I see.

50:54.427 --> 50:56.636
You think you can make
all that money back, huh?

50:56.804 --> 50:58.096
I gotta.

50:58.264 --> 51:00.140
You know, you're crazy.

51:00.641 --> 51:02.892
Look, Cal, don't you know...

51:03.060 --> 51:05.812
...that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

51:06.230 --> 51:08.231
- I'll get some money.
- How?

51:09.024 --> 51:10.608
- I'll get it.
- Heh, heh.

51:10.776 --> 51:14.237
Look, don't get so near me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.198
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

51:17.366 --> 51:19.492
Well, if you had 5,000...

51:23.831 --> 51:25.749
- Five thousand dollars?
- Mm.

51:25.916 --> 51:29.961
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

51:31.297 --> 51:32.464
Yeah.

51:32.631 --> 51:34.382
I know you wanna help your father...

51:34.550 --> 51:37.594
...but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.972
Maybe if you could raise 100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.850
No, I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

51:44.018 --> 51:46.478
- I'll get the 5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...

51:46.645 --> 51:50.190
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal. I'll get the 5,000.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.108
What are you gonna do, borrow it?

51:54.945 --> 51:56.571
Yeah.

51:57.281 --> 51:59.491
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

51:59.658 --> 52:02.327
...I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

52:02.495 --> 52:05.371
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

52:05.956 --> 52:08.750
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

52:08.918 --> 52:11.294
...and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

52:11.462 --> 52:12.837
So will a lot of other farmers.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.840
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.304
That's it. That's it. That's great.
When do we start?

52:22.264 --> 52:24.682
How do you know the price
is gonna go above 5, though?

52:24.850 --> 52:26.684
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

52:26.852 --> 52:29.020
We're apt to be in war any minute.

52:29.188 --> 52:32.816
You know, I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

52:32.983 --> 52:35.235
...and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

52:35.402 --> 52:37.737
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

52:37.905 --> 52:39.989
...that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.909
That's what I want. That's it. See?

52:43.744 --> 52:46.412
- How much will I make?
- Oh, enough for what you want.

53:34.753 --> 53:37.463
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.049
It's in the Bible.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.346
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

53:46.473 --> 53:48.224
Now, that's in the Bible too.

53:52.479 --> 53:53.813
What's he like?

53:55.983 --> 53:57.901
Oh, he looks like you.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.696
Well, is he like me?

54:01.864 --> 54:03.615
No. He's good.

54:08.037 --> 54:09.454
I'm more like you.

54:13.292 --> 54:14.667
How's Adam?

54:15.461 --> 54:16.961
How's your father?

54:18.589 --> 54:20.465
I don't wanna talk about him.

54:29.016 --> 54:31.517
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.570
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

54:43.155 --> 54:44.989
I knew you didn't.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.954
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

54:51.121 --> 54:53.623
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.004
What do you want?

55:02.341 --> 55:04.300
Just to look at me?

55:09.848 --> 55:11.766
I want $5,000.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.782
All right, come on in. Sit down.

55:28.492 --> 55:29.659
Come in.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.662
Try that chair.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.375
You got your father's eyes.

55:38.585 --> 55:40.712
That's all I can see of him.

55:42.047 --> 55:45.049
- You're a nice-looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.889
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

55:54.268 --> 55:55.935
- Caleb.
- Yes, ma'am?

55:56.353 --> 55:58.271
- Caleb and Aron.
- Yeah.

55:58.439 --> 56:01.190
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

56:01.358 --> 56:02.692
Them's just names.

56:03.235 --> 56:05.820
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

56:05.988 --> 56:07.864
Are you good in your studies?

56:08.907 --> 56:11.617
Oh, I get by with them.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.703
Does Aron get by with them?

56:13.871 --> 56:14.996
He's bright.

56:16.290 --> 56:20.209
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

56:20.711 --> 56:21.711
Maybe.

56:22.171 --> 56:25.089
Or back to some ranch?

56:25.257 --> 56:28.051
No, I don't like the ranch.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.720
Well, you take after me.

56:31.430 --> 56:34.932
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

56:36.602 --> 56:37.643
Sit down.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.025
Thanks.

56:49.114 --> 56:53.534
Now, what do you want with $5,000?

56:54.286 --> 56:55.995
I wanna go into business.

56:56.163 --> 56:57.955
You're a little young for that,
aren't you?

56:58.123 --> 56:59.457
I'm old enough.

56:59.958 --> 57:02.502
Well, yeah, I guess you're right.
I guess you are.

57:03.253 --> 57:06.297
- What kind of business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

57:07.674 --> 57:11.803
See, beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

57:11.970 --> 57:14.347
And we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

57:14.515 --> 57:16.891
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

57:17.059 --> 57:19.435
- Now, Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

57:19.603 --> 57:21.854
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

57:22.022 --> 57:23.356
You see...

57:25.317 --> 57:28.778
...my father, he lost about all he had in...

57:28.946 --> 57:31.906
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

57:33.575 --> 57:36.661
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

57:37.496 --> 57:40.748
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

57:40.916 --> 57:42.416
Yeah.

57:44.586 --> 57:45.628
Only...

57:47.005 --> 57:50.508
Only he's too good to bother
with money, huh?

57:53.846 --> 57:54.846
Okay.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.520
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

58:07.276 --> 58:09.360
Well, I don't know who else to ask.

58:11.738 --> 58:13.573
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

58:13.782 --> 58:16.576
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.622
Well...

58:22.332 --> 58:24.625
It's a good business venture.

58:27.671 --> 58:30.381
And I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

58:30.549 --> 58:33.134
You're a business woman, ain't you?

58:33.302 --> 58:34.760
One of the best, son.

58:36.054 --> 58:41.100
You know, Sam told me that
you think I ought to be run out of town.

58:44.188 --> 58:48.274
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

58:52.279 --> 58:54.447
This $5,000 now.

58:54.615 --> 58:57.366
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

58:57.534 --> 58:59.660
- Oh, I never thought about that.
- Heh.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.538
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

59:04.666 --> 59:06.334
- Maybe.
- Well, it's not.

59:10.339 --> 59:13.841
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.844
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

59:17.179 --> 59:19.347
Father thinks you're in the east...

59:20.682 --> 59:22.266
...and Aron thinks you're dead.

59:23.644 --> 59:27.563
Well, then there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

59:27.731 --> 59:30.858
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

59:37.282 --> 59:38.783
What are you staring at?

59:40.953 --> 59:42.453
How come you did it?

59:43.455 --> 59:44.455
Did what?

59:46.208 --> 59:47.333
Shot my father.

59:48.335 --> 59:49.585
Did he tell you that?

59:53.632 --> 59:56.509
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him...

59:56.677 --> 59:59.971
...ran away and did all that stuff?
- None of your business.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:04.016
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

01:00:04.685 --> 01:00:06.852
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.647
I just wanted him to let me go.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.818
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.779
He wanted to tie me down.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.490
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.617
...away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.161
Well, nobody holds me.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.706
- But he loved you.
- Love.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.376
He wanted to own me. He wanted to...

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:33.587
...bring me up like a snot-nosed kid...

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:37.425
...and tell me what to do.
Well, nobody tells me what to do.

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:42.263
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.182
Reading the Bible at me.

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:48.352
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.023
Maybe you know what I'm talking about, huh?

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:55.359
- Ha, ha.
- Always so right himself?

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:56.902
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:02.408
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me. Huh?

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.954
Yeah, you got sense.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.708
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.545
Maybe you know what people
are really like, what they want.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:17.715
I got the toughest house on the coast...

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:22.094
...and the finest clientele. Yeah.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.889
Half the stinking city hall go there.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.100
They sneak in at night...

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:31.145
...and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.981
And I built it up from nothing.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.401
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:40.363
...to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:41.781
You know, that's funny.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.617
Oh, well, I don't think
he'll know where I got it.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:48.287
No, but it's funny just the same.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.581
Your father.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:54.710
He's the purest man there is,
isn't he? Oh...

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:58.255
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:02.176
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.053
...to save him his purity.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.849
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:19.652
Okay.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.075
You tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.454
He's a good businessman.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:37.503
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.255
I don't know.

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.925
I do. Maybe he likes you.

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:45.136
Maybe.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:50.099
You're... You're a likable kid.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.358
Okay.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.318
You give this to him.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:05.698
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:07.199
...it's okay with me.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.304
You're a likable kid.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.063
Go on, go on, get out of here.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.486
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.113
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.934
Hi, partner.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.437
Boy, every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.153
- Kaiser.
- All we have to do is call his bluff.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.947
He'll come to heel like a dog.

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:20.124
We'll be over there and clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.266
Cal, stop it.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.394
There's Cal.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:49.445
Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
Hello, Cal.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.779
Thanks.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:03.542
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.588
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that. Will you go?

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:09.548
I think the war will be over. I don't think...

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:13.010
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.928
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.056
No, I guess you didn't.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.310
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:27.566
Oh!

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:31.945
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.491
I just don't believe it's right.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.551
Did you water them good?
Oh, sure, lots of water.

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.887
Not too much, though.
Oh, no, just right.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.075
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:20.285
I remember the day we sent him off.

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:25.165
A lot of troops' ships have been sunk
they don't tell us about.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:28.168
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.003
They're a military nation.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.423
Go back where you came from, German!

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.174
Go on home, German!

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.392
This is just the start.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.728
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.396
The German people don't want this war.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.732
The stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.317
...it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.738
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.157
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:02.369
I don't know. Somehow, on a ranch...
I don't know.

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.998
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:10.294
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

01:08:10.462 --> 01:08:11.462
Oh, Dad.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.090
You tired, Dad?
No, son.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.761
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the draft board.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.140
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:26.059
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Well, anyway...

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:29.020
...I had a look at the bank account
the other day.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.774
Not much left after my great fiasco.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.318
Ah...

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:39.448
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.953
Don't worry about money.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.048
Hey, Rantani!

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.259
Ain't this some sight?

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.844
Beans!

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.596
Yeah, boy, some beans.

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:06.390
You come here every day, boy.
What do you think...

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.602
...you gonna make them grow quicker?

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:19.363
He's crazy.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.497
Hey, where have you been?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.417
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.502
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.142
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.104
You wanna try one? No?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.150
Pick up my cigar.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.611
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:00.779
No, I'm not.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.906
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.325
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call somebo...

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:07.286
- Hi. What's the matter?
- Hello, Cal.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:11.248
Well, I was just trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.084
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.253
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- Yeah, I hope not.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:19.214
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.508
Here I am, lady.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.470
Ha-ha-ha. That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.265
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:31.310
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:34.938
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.066
- What time are you gonna meet him?
- At 8.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.278
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:44.323
- Yeah, I know it.
- I'm so glad you happened to be here, Cal.

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:45.574
Yeah.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.663
Eight, huh?

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.541
You got a half-hour?

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.673
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:02.841
I'm around.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:06.261
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:09.723
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.976
I feel awfully sorry for him.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.109
- You're terrible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.321
That's the first time that ever
happened to me too. Ha-ha-ha.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.532
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.328
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.539
I mean, it's awful, the war
and people killing each other.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.459
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.419
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.255
Three shots for a dime.
Oh, well, I'll agree with that.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.716
He's right.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.803
He's always right.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.972
And he has always been right.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.807
Now let's talk about something else.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.350
- All right.
- Okay?

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:55.769
Eight o'clock.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.646
We got a lot to see.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.983
- Will we be back in time for Aron?
- Yeah.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.154
All right. I'd love to.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:14.913
Easy.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.807
Ooh...

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.437
Oop...

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:43.066
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:47.821
Who was that?
Who?

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.032
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.952
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.914
- What are girls like that like?
- Huh?

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.332
Oh, all right, never mind.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.335
Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.920
...since the time of Julius Caesar.

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:07.591
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:08.842
Look.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.385
Do we have time?

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.637
- After the Germans had been through...

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.182
...the women of the town...
That German's here again.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:18.602
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:22.272
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:25.984
Here we go.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.330
It is lies, all lies.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:40.999
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.168
See over there. That's Castroville.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:44.711
Everything looks so small.

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:46.880
Higher and higher
And higher and higher

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.048
What?

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.467
Growing and growing
And growing and growing

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:54.471
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:01.019
Cal. Does Aron really love me?

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:05.107
- Um...
- I seem to have sort of lost him.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.985
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.655
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.157
I can't tell anymore.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.912
Cal, can I ask you something?

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:21.123
Yeah, go ahead.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.335
These girls that you always
go around with.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.797
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.882
What are girls like that like?

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:36.930
I mean, you don't really love them, do you?

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.977
Well, then why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.147
You're not angry, are you?

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.653
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad, Cal?
- Do you think I'm bad?

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.407
I don't know.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.036
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.455
I mean, Aron is so good...

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.583
...and I'm not.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.751
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.254
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.215
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:15.010
...and think about it
and that's all right, but...

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:19.306
These girls that you go out with, do...?

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:23.185
Maybe I don't know what love is exactly.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.439
I know love is good the way Aron says, but...

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.902
...well, it's more than that, it's got to be.

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.198
Oh, I shouldn't talk to you this way, Cal,
I shouldn't...

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.575
...but I don't know who else to talk to.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.536
And sometimes I think I'm really bad.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.040
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:50.503
- Well, Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:52.672
He's got to.

01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:55.884
The way I figure it out...

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:58.887
...Aron never having had a mother...

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:03.099
...well, he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:05.518
...and that's what he thinks I am.

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.480
And that's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:13.235
Because I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.488
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.076
Look at that star.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.871
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:26.873
Probably.

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:35.257
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.760
Well, she can just wait.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:40.762
She was pretty.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.644
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.875
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:18.425
I do, I do. I do.

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.889
- To give these fiends a lesson that...
- Have you seen Abra?

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:28.560
- Lies. All lies.
- What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:31.771
- Gus, come on. Let me talk to you.
- Hey, there's Aron.

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:35.317
I've never seen him like this before.
You're a good shoemaker.

01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:39.154
There's Aron down there.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.239
Why don't you stay out of politics?

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.574
Mr. Albrecht.

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:46.745
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.831
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:52.334
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again?

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.795
Hey! Hey!

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.137
Cal, don't! Cal.

01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:06.097
Hey, watch yourself, get back!

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.642
Please. Somebody pull him back.

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.145
Will you stop bothering me?

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:13.980
Come on.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:24.532
- Hey, Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink. Please.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.832
What are you waiting for?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.088
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.215
Aron, you are a child.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.764
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.600
Gustav.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.646
You all loved him a few weeks ago.
What's gotten into you?

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:56.523
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.025
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:02.404
Aron, there are rose plants in that border.
Please be careful where you step.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:06.866
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:09.536
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.622
What is it?
Let him come down and read it.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.417
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.544
Give it to me.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:25.677
"The government, with deep regret,
informs...

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:36.813
...that your son was killed in action,
15th of April.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.357
He died a hero and an American."

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.195
I'm sor... I'm sorry, Luca. I'm sorry.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.614
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.283
You're not sorry enough.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:51.411
I don't think he's sorry.
He's not sorry at all.

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:54.914
Why don't we all go on home...
You're not sorry enough.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:57.083
Why aren't you in the war?

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:58.918
This will make you sorry!

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.492
Hello, Charlie.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.786
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:38.166
Get up, Billy. Well, Loretta,
I didn't expect to find you here.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.043
Evening, Rose.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.756
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.050
Somebody owes you an apology.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.894
Well, how about you folks
all going home now?

01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.021
I think this'll do for tonight.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.403
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.697
May I?
Come in.

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.117
Hello, Cal.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.497
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:18.748
I'm gonna see to it.

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:30.426
Where were you?

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:35.098
Where did you get his coat?

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:47.986
You all right?

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:52.991
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.493
- Huh?
- You had to start slugging.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.246
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.039
I was trying to help you, Aron.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:03.459
If you wanna slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:07.797
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.306
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:21.811
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:23.146
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:25.773
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.781
Cal.
Abra.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:36.367
Wait here.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:41.414
- Wait.
- Aron...

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.575
I was trying to help him.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:22.789
Who am I kidding? I...

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:25.208
...tried to kill him.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.295
Give me a drink.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:33.841
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:37.011
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:42.141
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:46.562
Oh, Cal, please forget it, what happened up
on the Ferris wheel.

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.232
It didn't mean anything, really.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.901
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:55.405
Say it didn't. Please say it didn't.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:02.829
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:04.914
What?

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.501
Someday he's gonna know.

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:14.173
I don't understand you, Cal. You scare me.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.221
I know. I scare myself.
Abra.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.285
Fix me another drink.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:52.837
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800
Okay.

01:24:58.594 --> 01:25:01.429
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.391
Okay. I'll sleep here.

01:25:07.186 --> 01:25:10.229
Cal, come on. You've gotta go home.

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:12.231
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.025
...you come back, we'll go to the bank...

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:16.569
...and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:20.448
I'll buy out your share and
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:25.912
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

01:25:52.523 --> 01:25:53.523
Abra.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.237
What?
- Hey.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.155
- Who is it?
- Cal.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.617
Cal?
- Yeah.

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:09.247
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I wanna see you.

01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:12.458
Wait till I put something on.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.308
Cal.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:33.938
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:37.441
Yes. What is it, Cal?

01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:40.862
What's the matter? You look terrible.

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:46.242
- I got it.
- What?

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:52.623
Remember that money Dad lost?

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.500
On that lettuce business?

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:00.923
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:03.843
- I got every cent.
- Well, that's wonderful, Cal.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.475
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:15.146
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.982
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:23.279
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:31.245
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:33.789
...to be there.

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:39.629
And I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:42.882
You could come
and help me get some junk...

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:45.843
...and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:50.848
And we'll get balloons and...

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:56.687
- Oh, what? Kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:01.651
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:21.462
I'm sort of... Sort of...

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:30.262
Why did I hit Aron?

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:35.017
Why did I hit him so hard?

01:28:46.405 --> 01:28:47.822
Will you help me?

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.450
Will you? Will you really help me?

01:28:53.704 --> 01:28:55.204
I'll help you, Cal.

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:01.335
Be careful.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:09.093
How'd I get up here? Oh. Oh.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:21.939
Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:25.109
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- Oh, I think it looks beautiful.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.236
- Don't you? I love the way it looks.
- Mm-hm.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.739
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:31.490
Oh, yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.993
- Do you think this is childish?
- No, not a bit.

01:29:34.161 --> 01:29:37.163
The room looks lovely.
Your father's gonna love it.

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.416
- Hey, how's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:42.668
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:46.130
- Aron didn't get him anything, huh?
- Well, he told me he had something.

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.600
- What?
- Well, he didn't tell me what it was.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:08.235
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.488
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:12.198
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:13.365
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:14.533
Okay.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.120
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.830
- You think it's pretty?
- Mm-hm.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.292
Cal, don't drink any more wine.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.882
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:34.011
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:36.931
Cal, I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:41.852
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.980
Oh, the brooms.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:47.942
- Don't do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:50.736
We'll let him come in here
and let the house speak for itself.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:54.907
- We'll just act like it's any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

01:30:56.535 --> 01:30:58.702
There. Cal.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.247
Cal.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.209
You look wonderful.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:07.878
Thanks.

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:19.890
But I need my son, Mr. Trask.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:22.893
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.311
I need him to work the farm.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.814
Oh, things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:29.400
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:32.987
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:34.321
Everything cost so much now.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.074
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:39.160
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.704
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:44.874
Come on, Papa.
- I don't like it.

01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.544
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.842
Oh, hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:58.179
- Gonna stay for dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:02.224
Oh, no, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the draft board.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.811
- Oh, did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:08.230
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:11.859
- Well, we could use it.
- Hey, let's go in.

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:35.007
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:37.635
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:38.886
Are you surprised?

01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:41.055
I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:42.431
We knew you had, didn't we?

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:44.975
Completely. I don't know what to say.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:50.481
We got... Hey, we got turkey.

01:32:50.649 --> 01:32:54.193
And champagne.
Champagne. Oh, we got all the trimmings.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.820
Champagne.

01:32:57.072 --> 01:33:00.616
We got the trimmings here.
Oh, isn't that pretty? Yes.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.117
I, uh...

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:07.414
...got something for you.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:11.043
Oh, presents too. Isn't that nice? Look.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.342
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:22.846
Dad, Abra and I have one for you too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:28.102
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:34.692
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:38.946
A lovely birthday present.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:42.491
You have my blessing.
Thank you, Dad.

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:47.454
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No, no.

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:52.584
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:54.086
Excuse me.

01:33:55.588 --> 01:33:59.842
Of course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:05.306
What's this?

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:08.851
What is this?

01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:14.315
Well, uh, I made it. And it's for you.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.317
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.736
- You made it? But how?
- Yup.

01:34:21.031 --> 01:34:22.072
Go on.

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:24.950
- Beans.
- Beans?

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:29.872
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:35.377
...and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:40.049
So, um, that's for you.

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:44.219
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.805
That's for you.

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:51.685
- I made it for you.
- Cal, you will have to give it back.

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:58.984
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:03.030
You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

01:35:03.198 --> 01:35:06.825
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:09.703
- I can't give it back to them.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:11.372
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:14.875
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:16.085
Cal.

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:19.755
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:22.508
...and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

01:35:22.675 --> 01:35:24.551
Not one will come back untorn.

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:28.055
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:33.435
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.814
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.775
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:41.276
I'll never take it.

01:35:41.444 --> 01:35:44.696
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:47.866
...something like...
Well, like your brother's given me.

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:51.954
Something honest and human
and good. Don't be angry, son.

01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:55.749
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:57.876
That's something I could value.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:23.277
Cal!

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.198
I hate you!

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:44.673
Abra?

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:48.010
What are you doing?

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.141
Cal. Oh, Cal.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:56.643
He doesn't want anything from me.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:59.938
Cal, don't. Don't.

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:02.483
Please, don't.

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.737
Cal. Cal.

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.451
Abra!

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.183
Don't you ever touch her again.

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:40.312
I don't trust you.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.483
You're no good.

01:37:45.443 --> 01:37:49.738
You're mean and vicious and wild,
and you always have been.

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.740
You know it too, don't you?

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:54.576
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

01:37:54.744 --> 01:37:58.872
...you could think of since you were a child,
and we've always forgiven you.

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:01.792
But now I don't want you
to go near Abra.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.170
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:36.243
You wanna go some place with me, Aron?
Why should I?

01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:40.956
I got something to show you.

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:46.295
Think you'll find it very interesting.
What are you talking about?

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:50.757
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

01:38:51.467 --> 01:38:54.386
What do you mean by that?
Maybe she didn't.

01:38:54.554 --> 01:38:56.388
Maybe she's alive someplace.

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:00.142
What are you up to now?

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:03.854
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.401
You said she must have looked like
heaven's youngest angel, remember that?

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:12.738
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:15.365
You cried and you said...

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:18.619
...that she would have cried too,
because she was so tenderhearted.

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:21.580
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:25.834
I just wanna show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:27.461
What's the matter, you afraid?

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:30.005
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:35.552
Can you look at the truth, just once? Huh?

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:41.975
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you? Huh?

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:43.727
Come on.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.398
Come on, I wanna show you something.
It won't take very long.

01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:24.893
Oh, Cal.

01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:28.105
Hello.

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.277
Oh, Cal.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:57.134
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.638
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:12.482
Aron. Say hello to your mother.

01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:20.824
Cal.

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.833
Say hello to your mother, Aron!
Oh!

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:34.588
Joe! No! No!

01:41:44.724 --> 01:41:46.725
Play another song!
Quiet!

01:41:48.895 --> 01:41:49.936
Five!

01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:54.691
I'm thinking of the lilac trees
That shook their purple plumes

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:59.070
I'm thinking of the rivulet
With its cool and silvery flow

01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:03.658
Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
And the peppermint below

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:12.876
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.628
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:16.963
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:20.133
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:22.385
I like it. I think it's great.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:25.222
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:28.767
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

01:42:28.935 --> 01:42:33.063
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:36.024
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:39.402
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

01:42:40.112 --> 01:42:42.614
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

01:42:42.782 --> 01:42:45.450
You never gave either one of us
an inch ever...

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:47.369
...from what you thought was right.

01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:51.414
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.292
I know why you didn't love me.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.836
Because I'm like my mother...

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:58.922
...and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:00.590
Oh, yeah.

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:05.053
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:09.975
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

01:43:10.643 --> 01:43:13.144
She's over there in Monterey,
if you wanna know.

01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:15.063
She owns one of them houses.

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:19.234
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

01:43:19.944 --> 01:43:24.489
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:31.371
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

01:43:33.499 --> 01:43:35.625
But now I don't want it anymore.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:41.965
- I can't use it anymore.
- Cal, don't talk to your father like that.

01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:48.054
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:51.474
It doesn't pay off.

01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:53.351
No future in it.

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:54.853
Don't want it anymore.

01:43:56.355 --> 01:43:58.106
Let him go if he wants to.

01:44:00.484 --> 01:44:01.526
No.

01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:04.988
No, I won't.

01:44:17.835 --> 01:44:19.669
You hate me too, don't you?

01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:22.589
I'm afraid of you.

01:44:27.678 --> 01:44:31.264
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

01:44:33.935 --> 01:44:36.478
I feel like I'm to blame too.

01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:42.525
Adam! Adam! Adam!
Here. What is it?

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:46.029
Drunk and had a couple fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:50.241
He's at the station now.
I'll drive you down in my car. Cal!

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:55.246
Cal.

01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:59.751
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

01:44:59.919 --> 01:45:02.921
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

01:45:03.089 --> 01:45:05.215
...and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

01:45:05.383 --> 01:45:07.300
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

01:45:07.468 --> 01:45:09.803
...and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

01:45:09.971 --> 01:45:13.556
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:16.101
I think you better get down there.

01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:19.104
Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:23.233
Aron!

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:26.361
Aron!

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:32.033
'Cause I love from head to toesie

01:45:32.201 --> 01:45:35.704
Lovey mine

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:20.540
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:28.006
This one is a leakage of blood
in the brain caused by shock.

01:46:28.174 --> 01:46:30.258
There's been earlier, smaller leakages.

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:33.595
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

01:46:34.013 --> 01:46:36.723
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

01:46:37.933 --> 01:46:41.102
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:43.480
He might die tonight.

01:46:50.446 --> 01:46:53.823
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

01:46:58.496 --> 01:46:59.954
Good day.

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:01.873
Thank you.

01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:05.502
Good day, doctor. Good day, Sam.

01:47:07.505 --> 01:47:10.423
Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him.

01:47:10.966 --> 01:47:15.095
And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:19.516
Now why don't you go away some place?

01:47:34.198 --> 01:47:37.200
He's right.
- No.

01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:41.704
Yes, he is. He's right.
That's what I'll do.

01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:43.915
That's what I'll do.

01:47:51.757 --> 01:47:54.008
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

01:47:55.886 --> 01:47:57.011
Thank you.

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:01.266
- Oh, there you are.
- How is he?

01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:04.310
Oh, he's fine. He's my darling.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:06.271
Washed his face, combed his hair.

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:07.981
Can I go in there now?

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.943
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:17.699
- How is he really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:20.285
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:22.036
I didn't think so.

01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:25.373
Well, I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:29.711
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:48.313
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's gonna be a darling patient.

01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:51.858
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

01:48:53.068 --> 01:48:54.986
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:58.156
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:00.783
I'll report you to the doctor.

01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:03.745
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.240
Father.

01:49:43.661 --> 01:49:44.994
Can you hear me?

01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:52.460
I did an awful thing.

01:49:56.632 --> 01:49:57.715
I'm sorry.

01:50:02.221 --> 01:50:03.596
I'm... I'm...

01:50:27.871 --> 01:50:29.122
Mr. Trask.

01:50:32.418 --> 01:50:34.502
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

01:50:35.587 --> 01:50:37.714
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

01:50:38.924 --> 01:50:40.341
Can you answer?

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:44.887
I think you can understand me, though.

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:49.475
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:53.688
You understand everything I say,
only you can't show it.

01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:00.153
Mr. Trask.

01:51:01.322 --> 01:51:05.158
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:09.829
...but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:14.584
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:18.588
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

01:51:18.756 --> 01:51:21.591
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

01:51:22.926 --> 01:51:26.054
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

01:51:27.848 --> 01:51:32.602
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:35.772
You never asked him for one thing.

01:51:37.107 --> 01:51:41.069
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes, well...

01:51:43.155 --> 01:51:47.158
Well, he did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:50.495
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:52.747
...or else he'll never be a man.

01:51:53.457 --> 01:51:57.710
He'll just keep on feeling guilty and alone
unless you release him.

01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:00.713
Please help him.

01:52:01.256 --> 01:52:04.926
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

01:52:05.094 --> 01:52:07.637
...and you're the only one who can do it.

01:52:07.805 --> 01:52:10.223
So try, please try.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.811
If you could ask him for something...

01:52:15.604 --> 01:52:18.523
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:21.109
Let him do for you.

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:29.492
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

01:52:34.873 --> 01:52:36.332
You've tired my patient...

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:40.044
...and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

01:52:42.339 --> 01:52:46.259
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

01:52:46.552 --> 01:52:49.262
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.556
- No. No.
- Well, then stop it.

01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:54.809
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

01:52:54.977 --> 01:52:58.146
- I can't.
- Please try.

01:52:58.522 --> 01:52:59.856
Get it straight.

01:53:00.899 --> 01:53:05.027
Get through to him somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

01:53:05.863 --> 01:53:08.823
Please. Please.

01:53:11.702 --> 01:53:15.621
Is there any coffee around here?
I'll get you some in a minute.

01:53:19.334 --> 01:53:23.629
Cal. Try. Try.

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.090
Is there anything to read around here?

01:53:27.885 --> 01:53:29.051
What would you like?

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:33.389
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

01:53:48.322 --> 01:53:52.033
I tried to believe it was born in me...

01:53:52.201 --> 01:53:55.912
...and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:00.166
A man has a choice.

01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:03.044
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

01:54:03.212 --> 01:54:04.712
You see, I remember.

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.342
A man has a choice, and the choice
is what makes him a man, see.

01:54:10.886 --> 01:54:12.178
You see, I do remember.

01:54:12.971 --> 01:54:14.889
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Shh.

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:16.682
Get out!

01:54:27.528 --> 01:54:28.528
Look.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.283
Cal.

01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:40.122
Do something...

01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:43.501
...for me.

01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:44.919
Yes.

01:54:49.049 --> 01:54:52.093
That woman...

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:57.848
...the nurse, can't stand her.

01:54:59.268 --> 01:55:00.935
Get me another.

01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:18.828
I can't stand her either.

01:55:23.333 --> 01:55:24.917
And Cal...

01:56:11.214 --> 01:56:12.590

01:56:19.306 --> 01:56:22.725

01:56:24.269 --> 01:56:26.812
He said, "You stay with me...

01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:30.566
...and you take care of me."
- Oh.
