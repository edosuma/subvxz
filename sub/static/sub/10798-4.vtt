Captain's log, stardate 42402.7

00:06.840 --> 00:09.508
We are traveling
in the Omega Sagitta System

00:09.676 --> 00:14.138
traversing between twin planets
that form the coalition of Madena.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.807
Both worlds are populated
by a humanoid race

00:16.975 --> 00:19.768
which colonized the planets
two centuries ago

00:19.936 --> 00:23.689
and which now coexist under
a precarious but successful treaty.

Unidentified vessel approaching.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.286
Sensor readings show it to be
a small Class Nine vessel.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.955
Probably an interplanetary
cargo ship.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.791
One life sign aboard, sir.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.794
lt appears to be humanoid.

WORF: Confirmed.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.842
Armed with lasers only.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.761
lts cargo holds are empty.

00:53.928 --> 00:57.014
The readout shows
its guidance system is malfunctioning.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.309
The pilot is attempting to hold course
manually.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.145
l recommend we set the Enterprise
on an intercept course

01:03.313 --> 01:05.022
in case he needs
emergency assistance.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.774
Make it so, Mr. Crusher.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.776
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

Captain Okona at your service, sir.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.020
There's no need for your phasers,
captain.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.482
I'm harmless and not quite yet ready
for a mercy killing.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.859
You were never considered
a danger, captain.

01:51.027 --> 01:55.781
Oh, that's a shame. l can remember
when l was at least considered a risk.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.451
l'm the owner
and operator of this craft,

01:59.619 --> 02:02.121
and since we both know
that you've already scanned it,

02:02.330 --> 02:03.664
you know l'm alone and empty.

02:03.832 --> 02:08.752
Which is truly a rare occasion
for a man of my charm and talent.

Mute main viewer.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.340
- Counselor?
TROl: His emotions suggest

02:13.508 --> 02:18.178
he's mischievous, irreverent,
and somewhat brazen.

02:18.346 --> 02:22.641
The word that seems to best describe
him is rogue.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.102
Rogue?

02:25.770 --> 02:29.773
Ah. Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain,
wild elephant--

02:29.941 --> 02:33.944
Yes, Data, but there is
no malevolence or ill will.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.324
Audio on. Do you have a burnout
in your guidance system, captain?

02:39.492 --> 02:42.828
Whoa. Since you're able to diagnose
my problems,

02:43.037 --> 02:44.413
how about helping me fix them?

02:44.581 --> 02:48.917
Captain, we can easily repair
the type of system he uses.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.253
We can accommodate you, captain.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.590
This is the First Officer. lf you
prepare to shut down your engines,

02:54.757 --> 02:56.884
we can lock on the tractor
and beam you here.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.179
Sir, recommend limited access
to our ship.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.472

Excuse me, commander,
is that a woman's voice I hear?

03:13.735 --> 03:16.153
Yes. Now please follow
Commander Riker's instructions

03:16.321 --> 03:18.739
so our ship can get back
to its normal routine.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.699
OKONA:
Whatever you say, captain.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.576
Something funny?

Well, the unexpected

To boldly go

Hold it steady, Wesley.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.148

- Aye, sir.

Easy, easy.

Wesley, Data, let's go.

A Klingon security officer?

Yes.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.862
No wars available, eh?

06:14.248 --> 06:18.085

Welcome aboard, Captain Okona.
l'm Commander Riker.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.719
lf you'll turn over the inoperative part
to Commander Data,

06:27.929 --> 06:28.970
we can begin repairs.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.473
l'd be most happy to do
the work myself, commander.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.642
l'm sort of the hands-on type.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.812
l think you'd find the tools we use
rather unusual, sir.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.981
l can believe that.
May l at least watch?

06:40.858 --> 06:42.984
- That can be arranged.
- Good, then.

06:43.152 --> 06:46.071
Commander, l leave this
in your capable hands.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.825
Sir, this is Commander Data.
l'm just an Acting Ensign.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.369
Well, Acting Ensigns have names,
don't they?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.247
Wesley. Wesley Crusher.

Nice to meet you, Acting Ensign,

07:09.053 --> 07:11.513
You have the majestic carriage
and loveliness

07:11.681 --> 07:15.100
that could surely be traced
back to the noblest families.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.063
Well, l'm sure you've said that
to many ladies before

07:20.231 --> 07:22.607
and it was no more true then
than it is now.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.027
But it's how l say
it that's really important.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.612
The warmth,

07:27.780 --> 07:31.032
the attraction that l have for you.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.911
The attraction that we share.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.856
Now, that's sex appeal.

Sexual attraction in this context
is not a part of my programming.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.070

Well, then, have you seen

That's a joke. lt's funny.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.934
Let me show you.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.312
On your old one here, the Zelebium
contacts wore down and then fused.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.900
Now what l've done
is replace them with Tricellite.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.278
Tricellite isn't available in this system
if l ever had to replace it.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.490
Don't worry, you won't.
Your ship will never outlast this part.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.784

or the way l fly my ship?

08:55.952 --> 08:56.952
[LAUGHlNG]

08:57.119 --> 08:59.412
Well, this part.
But the stress test did show

08:59.580 --> 09:03.917
that you tend to push your ship
a little beyond its designed capabilities.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.836
Blame the pattern of my life,
Lieutenant La Forge.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.214
Because it relegates me
to cargo carrying

09:09.382 --> 09:12.092
rather than the grand explorations
you enjoy,

09:12.260 --> 09:15.929
l am forced to add a measure
of flamboyancy and zest

09:16.097 --> 09:18.807
to the doldrums of my existence.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.440
- Have you ever been cold?
- No.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.735
- Warm then?
- No.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.989
- What about drunk, ever do that?
- From alcohol?

09:34.156 --> 09:36.992
- That is not possible for me, sir.
- Pity.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.952
What about love?

09:39.745 --> 09:43.415
- The act or the emotion?
- They're both the same.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.501
l believe that statement
to be inaccurate, sir.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.462
Maybe.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.548
Life

09:51.882 --> 09:55.343

weight onto your spacecraft.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.886
lf it's canaries,

half of them flying all the time.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.310
You're all right.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.313
l doubt that statement
is entirely accurate either, sir.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.152

- You don't know what a joke is?
- Of course l do.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.033
lt is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.702
a fluctuation of words
concluding with a trick ending.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.039
That's the dictionary meaning.
l'm talking about humor, fun.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.874
Do you know what funny is?

Where is 806?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.382
Right over there, sir. Why?

You probably wouldn't
understand that either.

Commander, what do you think
of Captain Okona?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.970
Well, Okona is an interesting man
certainly.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.223
We've seen how he handles
his ship.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.934
Apparently he knows how to handle
people as well.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.435
Then why does he work alone?

11:27.603 --> 11:30.438
He's a man who lives his life
by his own rules.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.150
He does what he does by choice,
by his choice.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.778
Someday you'll make yours.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.572
l already have.

11:47.039 --> 11:51.710
So you agree with Okona that l am
missing a very important human factor.

11:51.877 --> 11:56.548
l never said that. l simply said
that l've never seen you laugh.

11:56.716 --> 12:01.511
l am capable of that function,
when it is expected of me.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.932
Data, do you even know
what a joke is?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.894
Of course l do.
lt is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot,

12:10.062 --> 12:11.730
- a fluctuation--
- Stop.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.149
Look, there's just you and l here.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.193
We're talking, we're having
an intimate conversation.

12:17.361 --> 12:21.656
Why? Because you're a droid
and l'm a noid.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.242
- But why?
- Because that's what l am.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.663
- Have l said something to offend you?
- No.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.248
Then why are you annoyed?

12:30.416 --> 12:37.297
Because you're a droid
and l'm a noid.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.800
- Humanoid.
- Yes.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.343
- You told a joke?
- Yes.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.679
- l am not laughing.
- Yes.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.851
- Perhaps the joke was not funny.
- No. The joke was funny.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.311
lt's you, Data.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.856
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.859
l agree. What do l do?

12:58.652 --> 13:02.197
Well, under normal circumstances,
l'd say seek a higher power.

13:02.364 --> 13:06.159
But in your case, probably
a smarter computer is in order.

13:12.666 --> 13:16.211

Why certain combinations of words

Please specify.

13:25.721 --> 13:30.350
Animated presentation, humanoid,
interaction required.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.812
Physical humor, cerebral
or general raconteur?

13:35.022 --> 13:39.067
Of all performers available,

13:39.235 --> 13:41.236
Twenty third century, Stan Orega,

13:41.403 --> 13:44.531
specialized in jokes
about quantum mathematics.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.116
No. Too esoteric.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.411
- More generic.
- Accessing.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.000
That one.

13:56.168 --> 14:03.132
- RW96321 , 20th century.
- Program complete. You may enter.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.857
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.776
You've been great.
l'd like to take you all home with me.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.696
Unfortunately, l took the last audience
home and there's no more room.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.074
Heh. Buh-bum.
But thank you, really, thank you.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.869
And thank you for bringing me here.
What's up?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.038
Mr. Comic, l wish to know
what is funny.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.418
Funny? l don't know.
lt's a matter of opinion, l guess.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.587
Tip O'Neill in a dress.

14:40.754 --> 14:44.090
Some people say words
that end with a K are funny.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.719
A briefcase that looks like a fish.
Personally, l find that hysterical.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.222
Tip O'Neill. Accessing.

14:53.601 --> 14:58.813
Twentieth century male, politician,
overweight, wearing female clothing.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.900
Carrying a valise that
looks like a fish.

15:02.067 --> 15:08.823
So the juxtaposition of gender
and an amphibian briefcase is funny.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.869
Well, l think whatever
makes you laugh is funny.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.917
Nothing makes me laugh.
l wish to learn.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.628
Well, how much time
do we have here?

15:21.795 --> 15:24.464
- Unlimited.
- We're gonna need it.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.885
- Because you, pal, are a tough room.
- Tough room?

15:29.428 --> 15:34.140
Ah. A colloquialism meaning a severe,
rigid, close-minded audience.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.019
l understand. l will attempt
to be an easy room.

15:38.187 --> 15:42.523
- Show me what is funny.
- All right, you're on. Uh...
