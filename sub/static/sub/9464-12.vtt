00:00.917 --> 00:04.458
-[Gerry breathing heavily]

00:04.500 --> 00:06.875
I'm a teacher at Xavier Academy.

00:06.917 --> 00:09.291
If you find this video...

00:09.333 --> 00:11.208
Please get it to the
camp director.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.417
Please, someone find this.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.625
Oh, what's the name
of this camp?

00:15.667 --> 00:18.417
But her name is Jasmine...
Jasmine something...

00:18.458 --> 00:20.625
I don't know her last name,
but she's hot.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.917
Oh god, I'm scared.
To my future kids that...

00:23.959 --> 00:25.917
We probably would have had...

00:25.959 --> 00:29.625
I'm sorry I don't know
you that well or...

00:29.667 --> 00:33.041
At all, really, 'cause...
I never had you yet.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.333
-[Moaning in background]

00:35.375 --> 00:38.417
-That's all for now.
I hope I see you again.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.875

00:51.917 --> 00:54.875
-Bathroom. Somebody point me to
the bathroom!

00:54.917 --> 00:57.291
-It's the great outdoors,
it's all a bathroom.

00:57.333 --> 01:00.250
-Oh, I actually forgot
you were here.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.375
-We sat together on the bus.
-Did we?

01:02.417 --> 01:04.625
-Yes, 'member I was
telling you...

01:04.667 --> 01:07.792
-Anyway, welcome to your
leadership camp.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.250
And by the end of the day,
we hope...

01:10.291 --> 01:13.709
You will become better leaders.
-That's why I'm here.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.125
Do's and don'ts.
-[Gerry]: Ahhh, allergies...

01:16.166 --> 01:19.959
Make sure you have your EpiPen's
out of your bags, before we
start off on the day.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.875
Thomas, you should bring your
asthma inhaler, it says here.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.875
Shelby? Where's Shelby?

01:24.917 --> 01:28.917
Heat, moss, bees, perfume, nuts,
sun, mold, dust, dairy products.

01:28.959 --> 01:31.166
I think we should just all
get away from Shelby.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.875
Think again about picking Shelby
for your group, I'm just saying.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.166
You know what? Actually, Shelby,
you're in the sun right now.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.083
You should go on the bus.
Seriously.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.917
We'll bring you back out later
when the games and activities
start.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.500
Watch you don't touch him,
please. Thank you Shelby.

01:43.542 --> 01:46.291
The sun doesn't go away, Shelby,
you better hope for rain.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.917
You're on there the whole
day, I'm sorry.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.083
-[Lisa]: Hi everyone.

01:51.125 --> 01:54.208
Ted.
-Hey, Lisa!

01:54.250 --> 01:57.750
-Hanging out?
-Yeah, well, I gotta pick
up Emma later, so...

01:57.792 --> 02:00.375
-Oh yeah? Seven hours from now?
-[Ted chuckles]

02:00.417 --> 02:03.542
-Everyone, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

02:03.583 --> 02:05.750
but Arthur Jenkins passed away.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.917
-What? That's horrible.
-Ohhh.

02:07.959 --> 02:10.125
-Good guy, gone way too soon.
[Dwyer's cell phone rings]

02:10.166 --> 02:13.542
-[Emma]: First Edna's freak
heart attack, and now poor
Artie? This is awful.

02:13.583 --> 02:16.291
-I gotta take this call.
Pardon me.
[Phone beeps on]: Hey.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.875
-You know, maybe should just
take a moment of silence.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.792
[Door slams]

02:21.834 --> 02:24.458
-So, who do you think is going
to be the next one to kick the
bucket?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.417
-That's what I was thinking.
-[Lisa]: Trudy!

02:26.458 --> 02:29.166
I'm gonna go ahead and assume
that that's just the grief
talking.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.375
-Bad things always happen in
threes.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.250
So that means one of us is
going to be the next to go.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.125
-Ooooh.
-[Lisa]: That's ludacris.

02:36.166 --> 02:39.250
-I think I want in on this bet,
how much are we talking here?

02:39.291 --> 02:43.125
-No! We are not betting on
who's going to die next.

02:43.166 --> 02:47.000
These are people's lives,
it's not a game.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.166
-Okay, but my money's on
Williams biting it first.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.375
-I got twenty on Gillis.

02:51.417 --> 02:53.542
-I'll put that in a safe
deposit box.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.750
-I don't know what you guys
are betting on but, I want in.

02:56.792 --> 03:00.083
I really need a win.
My ex-wife's really
bleeding me dry.

03:00.125 --> 03:04.208
-I know Paul. As much as I
would never want to hear the end
of that we're doin' this now.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.458
-Can I get a IOU?
-[Laughs]: An IOU.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
-Absolutely not.

03:09.542 --> 03:13.125
-Okay everyone, if I could
have your attention I just
need you to stay still.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.208
Stand here for a few minutes
until I figure out where we're
going first.

03:16.250 --> 03:20.458
Okay? So don't get too far away.
Just stay close to base here,
alright?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.917
Thank you.
-Hi, Mr. Duncan?

03:22.959 --> 03:26.000
-Yes.
-Hi, I'm Jasmine, the
camp director.

03:26.041 --> 03:29.375
-Wow, well I'm Mr. Duncan.
Gerry, the teacher.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.291
-Okay, nice to meet you Gerry.
-Nice to meet you.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.875
-I guess you and I are
spending a lot of time
together today.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.083
-Well that's great news,
isn't it?

03:36.125 --> 03:38.959
-Camp Hotta-Wowy!
Hi, I'm Robert. Vice Principal.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.166
Kind of in charge here.
Call me Bob, if you like.

03:41.208 --> 03:43.375
-My students that I brought.
My trip, I planned it.

03:43.417 --> 03:46.166
-[Robert]: My school.
-And I'm the one they
look at as a role model.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.417
Their words, not mine.
-Well, it's great to meet
you both.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.583
-Nice meeting you.
-Two things that I know
about Jasmine.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.792
One, it's a genus of shrub...
-[Gerry sighs]

03:52.834 --> 03:55.000
In the olive family.
Distant cousin, I think.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.500
And two, delightful
Disney Princess.
-Wow!

03:57.542 --> 04:00.709
You know your plants.
-How do we get started?
What do we do?

04:00.750 --> 04:03.291
-Yeah, anything.
-I would actually love
some help.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.291
If one of you wants to help me
set up the orienteering game.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.250
-Hello!
-That would be perfect.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.041
-I'm the one, I'm the guy,
I'll do it. I'll set up...
-[Jasmine]: Perfect.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.208
-What is it again?
-What is orienteering?

04:13.250 --> 04:15.500
It's when you take these
cards and you put them around
in the woods.

04:15.542 --> 04:18.458
-Yes
-And then the kids use that
compass to track coordinates.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.208
-Okay, I'll take that.
Yeah, good. Alright, so
why don't you give her...

04:21.250 --> 04:24.166
The cards.
-You know what? Actually,
this is perfect.

04:24.208 --> 04:28.500
You know all about orienteering,
you can help Gerry set the
game up.

04:28.542 --> 04:30.417
-[Mouths]: No, no, no.
-I'm short staffed today.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.208
I can stay here with
everybody else.
-Just hearing it out loud...

04:33.250 --> 04:35.834
I think what makes the most
sense since, we both know what
orienteering is...

04:35.875 --> 04:40.083
Why don't we both go and put
these in the woods together and
he can stay here with the kids.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.750
-Can we just go back to the
original plan, Jasmine?
That you and I were going?

04:42.792 --> 04:46.000
And you look after the kids,
'cause your the VP? Can we do
that? That's the plan.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.208
That's what you said,
that's what you said.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.125
-Actually this would just be so
much faster if you guys could
do this together.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.542
Would you mind? It would be
really helpful.
-[Gerry]: Way to go.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.166
-Mommy, can I go with them,
please? Please mommy.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.083
-Mommy?
-Yeah.

04:58.125 --> 05:01.041
-You coulda told us you had
a son out of the gate.
That woulda helped.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.333
-He has a good point.
-Well, he has the day off
of school today.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.792
[Jasmine]: Kind of promised him
he could help me set up the
game.

05:05.834 --> 05:09.083
So, I know it's asking a lot,
but would you mind if he
tagged along with you?

05:09.125 --> 05:11.375
[Gerry clears his throat]
-Mind? No.

05:11.417 --> 05:13.333
-That's okay?
-Hooray!

05:13.375 --> 05:15.875
-Hey, yay...
-Thank you so much. I will see
you guys later.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.083
-Alright, yeah okay.
-[Robert]: Thank you so much.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.458
-Dammit! You! I was supposed to
go with her until you came in.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.875
Now it's you, me and Opie?
Seriously?

05:23.917 --> 05:27.083
You couldn't just mind your own
business? Ya had to come over.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.917
-Sorry, are you speaking to
yourself and I'm eavesdropping?

05:29.959 --> 05:32.291
-I'm bored. Aren't we
supposed to be doing something?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.709
-We have to wait for Mr. Duncan
to come back but we could
play a game.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.166
-Oh! Red Rover, Red Rover,

05:38.208 --> 05:40.959
I call fun over!
-[Kids groan]

05:41.000 --> 05:43.083
-Pleasure doing business
with ya.

05:44.792 --> 05:47.333
-Seriously? A Death Pool?

05:47.375 --> 05:49.250
This is incredibly insensitive.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.959
Why is my name on the list?
Right behind old man Withers?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.667
Right behind old man Withers?
Come on.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.917
-Yeah, you can't argue
with the odds, Lise.

05:57.959 --> 06:00.125
-Oh, let's face it, Lisa.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.917
Between the stress of your new
job and lack of time to exercise

06:02.959 --> 06:07.000
what's obviously crushing
loneliness, we figure you're
already on borrowed time.

06:07.041 --> 06:10.250
-Ahhh.
-And I'm taking this online
Reiki course.

06:10.291 --> 06:13.792
And I'm sensing a lot of
negative energy right here.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.083
-Really?
-Yeah.
-[Lisa sighs]

06:19.125 --> 06:22.041
-Alright everyone, I've got a
game. Rugby Spoons.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.333
So you're gonna go first, I'm
gonna give you a spoon.

06:24.375 --> 06:27.375
She's going to hit you as hard
as she can and then you're
gonna do the same thing.

06:27.417 --> 06:31.166
And whoever did it harder
gets a point.
-Don't go easy.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.792
-Okay, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.500
Outta there Lucy, outta there.
She's way too small.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.750
Now this is the match up.
-Alright.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.917
-This is the match up we've
all been waiting to see.

06:40.959 --> 06:44.250
-Alright, Mr. Hunt. Let's do it.
-Just gonna get this cleaned off

06:44.291 --> 06:47.291
before I put it in my mouth.
No offense Lucy.

06:47.333 --> 06:51.000
But, I want no part of the grade
nine boys you've been sucking
face with.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.166
That's not the world
I'm trying to live in.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.083
I need mono like I need
a hole in the head.

06:55.125 --> 06:59.500
-Alright Hunt, let's do this.
-I'm gonna spoon you Frank.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.667
And into the mouth.

07:01.709 --> 07:04.250
-[Gerry]: This was supposed
to be a romantic walk with
Jasmine and I.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.250
Why'd you have to ruin this?
-[Robert]: What are you talking
about? You ruined it.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.667
She and I were the ones
that had a connection.
-Connection?

07:09.709 --> 07:12.709
She had no connection or
interest in you. She was too
busy focussing on me.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.500
-I'm the one who's
unforgettable. Just like
I told my first girlfriend,

07:15.542 --> 07:18.917
you can drink all you want, but
you'll never be able to scrape
me from your memory.

07:18.959 --> 07:22.250
-Yeah, bet she drank a lot.
Anyway, what's the point in
arguing about it?

07:22.291 --> 07:24.875
Okay? It doesn't matter,
she's married. But if she
wasn't married,

07:24.917 --> 07:26.917
I promise you she'd pick
me over you.
-Do ya?

07:26.959 --> 07:29.000
-Yes!
-What are you guys
fighting about?

07:29.041 --> 07:33.083
-No, no, we're not fighting.
We're just talking loudly,
that's what adults do sometimes.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.875
-That's what mom and
dad used to say...

07:35.917 --> 07:38.250
Before they got divorced.
-What?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.834
-Hello.
-Your mom's divorced?
That's awesome.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.125
Hey! What's your name again?
-BJ

07:43.166 --> 07:45.458
-[Snickers]
-[Gerry]: Okay, B...

07:45.500 --> 07:47.709
BJ, let me ask you a question.

07:47.750 --> 07:51.208
Does your mom prefer funny,
smart, athletic guys?

07:51.250 --> 07:53.625
-Or maybe she prefers
a renaissance man.

07:53.667 --> 07:57.583
-[Mumbles]: Oh God.
-Right? Who likes books and
lively conversation and coupons.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.291
-I don't know.
-You know what? I'm gonna
go ask her.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.375
I'll head back to base camp
and I'll talk to her myself.

08:02.417 --> 08:06.417
You two, set up the game.
-Why don't you do that and I'll
stay here and bond with BJ

08:06.458 --> 08:09.542
-Now, which way...BJ, which
way did you bring us in here?

08:09.583 --> 08:11.917
-I don't know.
-We followed you, BJ.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.875
-We thought you knew 'cause
you're always here...

08:13.917 --> 08:16.458
-Where's base camp, Smokey the
Bear? What's your little compass
say?

08:16.500 --> 08:19.458
-I don't know how to use this.
-Do you see what it's
pointing at right now?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.417
-South.
-An idiot...

08:21.458 --> 08:23.834
Is not gonna get the girl.
-[Gerry]: Oh...Wait, BJ!

08:23.875 --> 08:26.250
-[Robert]: BJ!
-[Gerry]: Wait up,
what's the hurry?

08:26.291 --> 08:28.500
-[Muffled]: Down.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.667
[Deep breath]: Mmm!
-[Kids laugh]

08:30.709 --> 08:34.417
-Ooh, felt like butterfly kisses
from a tiny mosquito.

08:34.458 --> 08:37.625
-Okay. Let's see
what you've got.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.375
-Your turn, sir.
-Ready Mr. Hunt?

08:40.417 --> 08:43.208
-I was born ready. Actually,
I was born breech, but...

08:43.250 --> 08:46.625
Once they turned my butt around,
I was raring to go.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.041
K, let's do this.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.166
Ahh! Ahhh.
-[Kids laugh]

08:55.208 --> 08:57.583
-How did you do that?
-Guess I'm a natural.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.250
-It was a good round, but I'm
going to have to give it to
Frank.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.583
It was really close though.
-Okay.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.750
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Lower that head.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.959
Round two. Let's do this.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.083
[Deep breath]: Mmm.
-[Kids laugh]

09:10.125 --> 09:12.500
-[Frank laughs]: And I thought
I had atrophied muscles.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.750
-Ahhh! Ahhh!
-[Kids laugh]

09:19.792 --> 09:22.542
-AH HAHA HAHA HAHA HA HA!
FUNNY!

No more laughing.
New rule.

-Down!

09:27.542 --> 09:29.917
[♪ Music]
-No.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.291
No, not enough bars.
Thought that would work.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.417
-Really? The old stump and stand
didn't work?

09:34.458 --> 09:36.500
Here's what we're gonna do.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.667
We're gonna wait 'til dark and
then we'll follow the north star
out to the parking lot.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.500
-Yeah, lets just hang out
here so his mom worries...
-[Sound of branches]

09:42.542 --> 09:45.125
-Shh! Oh my gosh.
-What? What?
-That's a bear.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.458
-A b...!
Oh no.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.625
-I'm pretty sure that
was a bear.
-How do you know?

09:49.667 --> 09:52.417
-There it is again. It's getting
closer, what do they say?
If it's black...

09:52.458 --> 09:55.083
-You never go back.
-That's different.
You fight back.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.542
But...If it's brown
you lay down.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.291
-[Whispers]: Flush it down.
It's coming from there?
-All I know...

10:00.333 --> 10:02.792
Is that I better run
faster than you.
-Ugh! Agh!

10:02.834 --> 10:05.500
Oh God, my ankle.
BJ, no!
-[Robert]: Bear! Bear!

10:05.542 --> 10:08.625
Go see the bear.
-[Robert]: Bear! Bear!
I'm out of here.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.333
-Ah.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.500
-Sleep deprivation decreases
life expectancy by twelve
percent.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.500
-[Bobbi sighs]

10:15.542 --> 10:18.375
-Depression! Second leading
cause of disease and early
death. Score!

10:18.417 --> 10:20.792
-Mmm, I am so attracted
to you right now.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.375
-I can't believe I put all my
eggs in the Williams basket,

10:23.417 --> 10:25.542
when you've clearly given up
on life.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.417
-That's not true. I'll have you
know that I live a meaningful

10:29.458 --> 10:32.291
and fulfilling life.
-Are your gums bleeding?

10:32.333 --> 10:35.166
-[Bobbi]: Agh!
-[Lisa gasps]

10:35.208 --> 10:37.542
Oh my god.
[Lisa tears up]

10:37.583 --> 10:41.166
This Death Pool's been
really hard on me.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.667
-Ohhh.
-[Lisa cries]

10:43.709 --> 10:47.083
-Come here Lisa.
I am so sorry.

10:47.125 --> 10:51.458
We had no idea. What are
we doing this for?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.709
-Yeah. Got it.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.959
-[Trudy]: Oh my.
-[Lisa cries]

10:56.000 --> 10:59.250
-[Trudy]: Listen, is there
someone I can call?
An exorcist maybe?

10:59.291 --> 11:02.291
-[Lisa cries harder]
-Okay.

11:02.333 --> 11:06.917
-Owwww!
Fuuuuuuuudgsicle.

11:06.959 --> 11:11.083
-Okay, we're done with
Rugby Spoons. Everyone
head back to your groups.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.583
-No! No! No! No!
Turn around.

11:13.625 --> 11:16.500
Nobody goes anywhere.
This isn't over Frank.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.583
I want another shot. I don't
know how you're doing this...

11:18.625 --> 11:21.417
With your tiny body, your less
developed brain than mine.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.750
I don't know if there's some
sort of super power happening
but I don't believe it.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.834
Lower that head!

11:27.917 --> 11:30.458
Prepare for pain, Frank.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.917
[Deep breath]: Mmm!
-Owww.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.250
I felt that one.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.083
-Owwwwww!!!

11:45.125 --> 11:47.625
Ugh!
[Frank falls to the ground]

11:49.083 --> 11:51.709
-Nice right hook, sir.
-[Frank groans]

11:51.750 --> 11:54.667
-Okay. Okay. O...

11:54.709 --> 11:58.041
Okay. Here's a fun game.

11:58.083 --> 12:02.250
I like to call it Shared Alibi.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.875
Hmm? Who here saw Frank trip?

12:04.917 --> 12:08.291
Who saw him trip? There it is.
There's one hand.
A couple hands.

12:08.333 --> 12:12.458
New game. It's called
Carry the Body.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.667
So I'm going to enlist a couple
of the bigger boys.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.667
Yup, strong girls.
-[Frank groans]: Oh God.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.542
-I gotta stop. I think it's
broken! Thank you!

12:20.583 --> 12:23.709
-Sorry for doing every single
thing I could to save us from
the bear.

12:23.750 --> 12:27.792
-There was no bear. And
even if there was, you left
BJ and I there to die.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.333
Tell your mom that, BJ. He left
us to die and I saved you.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.542
-[Robert]: BJ, look...
-[Gerry whispers]: It's hot.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.375
-No water.
-It's hot.

12:36.417 --> 12:40.375
-Ahh! I forgot.
[Gerry laughs excitedly]

12:40.417 --> 12:42.542
-You have water!
Can I...?

12:43.709 --> 12:46.166
-[Gerry]: Ahh.
Oh God.

12:46.208 --> 12:49.500
Okay. Here, recycle that BJ.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.834
You've gotta go get help.
-I can't!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.792
I'm too weak to go anywhere.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.208
-BJ's gotta go. BJ you gotta
go get help, Buddy.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.166
Okay? Go BJ!
-That's a good BJ.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.625
Ya know, when I say it out loud,
it's a terrible name for a
child.

13:01.667 --> 13:04.375
-[Lisa]: Hello everyone.
-Don't tell me, let me guess.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.291
You're here to shut down
the death pool?

13:06.333 --> 13:09.917
-No, I'm here to thank all of
you for betting on me to die.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.875
-Oh, acceptance. The last step.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.041
-I'm serious. You guys made me
take a long hard look at myself.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.375
And I didn't like what I saw.
So, I made some changes.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.583
I'm drinking green energy.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.709
I signed up for a tai chi class.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.417
And, I even gave my phone number
to a real live man.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.542
[Laughs]
-Yeah, ya did.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.917
-So, it looks like I am gonna
live a...

13:30.959 --> 13:33.458
Long healthy life.
-Ahhh.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.458
-[Lisa]: And you're all gonna
lose the death pool.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.417
Looks like everything's turning
up Lisa.
[Laughs]

13:39.458 --> 13:43.500
-I can't believe it! Ha!
My wife is dead.

-[Emma inhales sharply]
-[Dwyer laughs]

13:47.291 --> 13:49.875
-Well, there goes the pool.
Thanks everybody!

13:49.917 --> 13:53.166
-That's horri...
Ray!!!

13:53.208 --> 13:57.417
Look, I don't know how to
feel about it. I'm glad for
you. Sad for her.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.875
-[Emma laughs uncomfortably]
-[Dwyer]: Whoo!

13:59.917 --> 14:03.375
-[Ted]: How are you Lisa?
-Oh, her foot's twitching,
she's fine.

14:03.417 --> 14:06.500
-That's all for now.
I hope I see you again.

14:06.542 --> 14:09.709
-[Robert groans]
-Would ya shut up?

14:09.750 --> 14:12.375
I'm trying to do a video here.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.583
-Video?
-Yes.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.959
-What's the video for?
-A video in case we
don't get out of here.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.542
It's my last words,
is that okay?
-To who?

14:22.583 --> 14:24.917
-My loved ones.
-I want to make a video
for my loved ones.

-Hi Nanny, love you.
If you're seeing this,

14:35.500 --> 14:38.500
it's 'cause something terrible
happened to me.

-[Gerry]: Okay, alright.
That's good.

14:52.375 --> 14:56.333
I hope we do get out of here
alive 'cause I want to show
that to everybody at the school.

-Well, I was hoping it wouldn't
come to this.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.792
We're going to have to resort
to the secret of the forest.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.417
-What secret?
-We're gonna have to drink
our own urine.

15:27.458 --> 15:30.041
-Gross!
-To survive.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.250
-No, I'm not doing that.

15:32.291 --> 15:36.208
-I really think you're
underestimating the
severity of our situation.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.208
-I'm not drinking my own urine.
Weirdo!

15:38.250 --> 15:42.959
-Well you can stay here and rot,
but I'm gonna save myself the
only way I know how.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.333
-Go for it. It's disgusting.

-Can you just look at me
real quick?
-I'm not looking at you.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.458
-Oh, put that away.
-Have you ever heard of SBS?

15:54.500 --> 15:57.166
-What the hell is SBS?
-Showy Bladder Syndrome.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.208
And I'm a sufferer. I need
someone to stare at me in
order for me to pee.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
-No, no. I'm not the guy
for that.
-Who else do you see around?

16:03.041 --> 16:05.291
Well that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.917
-Try living with it.
-You live at home, alone.

16:07.959 --> 16:10.333
How do you do this?
-I have mirrors over my
toilets, Gerry.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.500
-Okay, well...
-I can solve my own problems,
at home.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.917
-So you stare at yourself? Okay.
-Look!
-I'm not looking at you.

16:14.959 --> 16:17.333
-There are so many things I'd
rather be doing than having this

16:17.375 --> 16:20.041
conversation with you in the
woods. Please just look at
me while I pee.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.375

-So I can drink my own urine.
So I can live.

-Are you serious? No! No.
-That's good. Just like that.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.834
You're inside your own head
about it, just look at me.

-Alright, fine.
-No, up here. My eyes
are up here.

look away 'cause then it really
hurts my stomach.

-Okay, run back to base BJ.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.250

-Bye Jasmine.

18:53.125 --> 18:56.000
-Uh oh, my cup runneth
over again. Simon?
-Uh huh?

18:56.041 --> 18:59.208
-Will you come into the woods
with me real quick? And just
stare into my eyes?

18:59.250 --> 19:01.125
-Oh, you need to go pee?
-Yes!

19:01.166 --> 19:03.333
-Yeah, let's go.
-Frank, I admire you buddy

19:03.375 --> 19:07.041
-Just believe you can do it,
Ger.
-Okay, thanks buddy.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.959
-This really is the icing on
one crap storm of a day.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.125
-Sort of a mixed metaphor.
-Shut up.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.667
-It's just, you don't put
icing on a storm.
-Shut. Up.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.667
-What have I said about
fighting at Xavier?

19:17.709 --> 19:20.291
-I wasn't listening.
-I don't think you ever said
anything, to be honest.

19:20.333 --> 19:24.417
-That's because I've never
had to reprimand any of
my staff...

19:24.458 --> 19:28.250
For fighting at Xavier over
a game...?

19:28.291 --> 19:31.750
Rugby Spoons? I don't
even know what that is.

19:31.792 --> 19:36.250
-Oh, you don't? It's just a
really fun game once you
get to know all the rules.

19:36.291 --> 19:40.041
-We could show you how to
play, if you want?
-Sure, why not?

19:40.083 --> 19:43.458
-[Simon]: Okay, come sit in my
chair. Oh, you're gonna love
this.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.125
-So much fun.
Okay.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.875
We'll use your fruit spoon. Just
put the handle in your mouth.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.834
-[Frank]: And I'll bend down
and you hit me on the top of
the head, as hard as you can.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.333
-That's it? This is a
stupid game.

20:01.375 --> 20:04.208
-Well, you kind of gotta get the
hang of it, here I'll show ya.

20:11.250 --> 20:14.125
-Ow! What the hell was that?

20:14.166 --> 20:16.458
-It's a prank.
-[Frank]: You've gotta hide
the spoon, Simon.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.667
-Oh you gotta hide it.
-[Lisa]: Get!

20:18.709 --> 20:20.875
- Ahhh. Ow, ow, ow, ow.
-Is that fun? Huh?

20:20.917 --> 20:23.333
-[Frank]: Ow, ow, ow. Sorry.
Oh sorry. Ow sorry.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.792
-[Lisa screams]: Is that fun?
-[Frank]: Ah, go, go, go, go!

20:25.834 --> 20:28.375
-[Lisa]: Argh!

matter is, we need the room

up for me?

heat of the moment...

a threat or something.
