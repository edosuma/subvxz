WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:04.338
When you work here,
you don't think about home

00:04.339 --> 00:06.173
and families and babies.
- That's not fair.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.716
He couldn't have known he was
gonna have a baby a year--

00:07.717 --> 00:09.217
Let me tell you something,
Stephanie.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.136
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made,

00:11.137 --> 00:12.930
because when people are trying,
they know they're trying!

00:12.931 --> 00:15.182
And just because no one ever
wants to try with you

00:15.183 --> 00:16.642
doesn't give you the right

00:16.643 --> 00:18.602
to tell me
how to run my associates!

00:18.603 --> 00:21.647
I got an offer for more money
than I'll see my whole life,

00:21.648 --> 00:24.274
and you want me to turn it down
based on a feeling

00:24.275 --> 00:26.067
that whatever happened to Chris
happened to other people?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.611
You're dating
your therapist.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.321
I don't need a lecture
from you, Louis.

00:29.322 --> 00:30.865
Does Donna have any idea
about the two of you?

00:30.866 --> 00:32.448
No, she doesn't,

00:32.450 --> 00:35.243
and for right now,
I'd like to keep it that way.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.954
Harvey, is there something
that you're not telling me?

00:36.955 --> 00:38.580
‘Cause it seems like you've been
different lately.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.916
We win this, you're gonna be
Andy Dufresne

00:40.917 --> 00:42.417
sitting on a beach in Mexico

00:42.418 --> 00:44.169
with a bank account
full of cash.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.713
I already make
a nice living in here.

00:45.714 --> 00:47.506
I was thinking
maybe some of that money

00:47.507 --> 00:49.174
might go to your
daughter.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.592
I wasn't lying about working
a case with Oliver.

00:50.593 --> 00:51.969
I just didn't tell you
which one.

00:51.970 --> 00:53.971
- The prison one?
- Yeah.

00:53.972 --> 00:56.765
- This is a fireable offense.
- Harvey isn't gonna fire me.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.226
Yeah, but maybe he should.
What is your word worth?

00:59.227 --> 01:02.187
The way things are going, it's
not gonna be worth very much.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.989
Hey.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.033
Hey.

01:14.034 --> 01:16.493
How long have you been up?

01:16.494 --> 01:19.538
A while.

01:19.539 --> 01:22.207
I've been thinking about what
you said to me last night.

01:22.208 --> 01:26.045
Mike, I didn't mean
to be so harsh.

01:26.046 --> 01:28.005
No, you were right.

01:28.006 --> 01:32.091
My word does mean
everything to me...

01:32.092 --> 01:34.887
which is why I'm gonna keep
helping Oliver.

01:34.888 --> 01:36.430
What?

01:36.431 --> 01:38.891
When I gave my word
to Harvey, I meant it.

01:38.892 --> 01:41.100
But before that, I gave
my word to Oscar Reyes.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.437
And I'm sorry,
but I-I can't back out now.

01:43.438 --> 01:45.647
Okay.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.233
So you're just gonna live
your life keeping secrets again?

01:48.234 --> 01:51.028
- This isn't like that.
- How is it not like that?

01:51.029 --> 01:52.863
You're keeping this
from Harvey.

01:52.864 --> 01:54.281
And Harvey kept things
from Jessica.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.157
Look at how that turned out.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.744
I tell Harvey now, and it's
the same as if he catches me.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.746
The case gets tossed,
and all of the people

02:00.747 --> 02:02.998
we're trying to help
keep getting abused.

02:02.999 --> 02:05.960
It's the same as before.

02:05.961 --> 02:08.461
No, Rachel, this is not
the same as when I was a fraud.

02:08.463 --> 02:09.964
And I'll tell you
something else--

02:09.965 --> 02:11.840
I used to have trouble
sleeping at night,

02:11.841 --> 02:13.216
but I sleep like a baby now

02:13.217 --> 02:15.761
because I am helping
these people.

02:15.762 --> 02:19.474
I'm sorry, but that's
the word that I'm keeping.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.064
Good morning.

02:27.065 --> 02:28.899
Hey.
Did you sleep well?

02:28.900 --> 02:31.192
If you consider eight hours
of bliss sleeping well,

02:31.193 --> 02:35.781
then, yes,
I slept very well.

02:35.782 --> 02:37.741
But now I have to go.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.827
- Wait.
- Harvey, I have patients.

02:39.828 --> 02:42.412
I know, but I wanted to get
your opinion on something.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.874
What have you done
this time?

02:45.875 --> 02:49.795
I haven't told Donna
we're seeing each other yet.

02:49.796 --> 02:51.254
Why not?

02:51.255 --> 02:52.923
Come on, you know
my history with her.

02:52.924 --> 02:55.174
We're working together.
I just promoted her.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.176
That's more an excuse
than a reason, isn't it?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.720
I don't want to create
a problem when there isn't one.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.221
And who says
there has to be one?

03:00.222 --> 03:02.099
There doesn't
have to be one, but--

03:02.100 --> 03:05.352
Harvey, first of all, you may
be underestimating her.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.228
I mean, Donna's a big girl.
- Paula--

03:07.229 --> 03:08.856
And second of all,
if I'm wrong

03:08.857 --> 03:10.858
and you're not
underestimating her,

03:10.859 --> 03:12.693
then you're only gonna
cause both of you

03:12.694 --> 03:14.695
a lot more trouble down
the road when she finds out.

03:14.696 --> 03:17.156
‘Cause, Harvey,
she is gonna find out.

03:17.157 --> 03:20.241
So you're telling me
to tell her?

03:20.242 --> 03:22.619
You already know
what you need to do.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.454
You just asked me
because sometimes we need

03:24.455 --> 03:27.041
to hear it
from someone else.

03:35.884 --> 03:37.592
They didn't tell me
you brought a sidekick.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.053
Frank, this is Oliver Grady.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.387
He's the one
that's trying the case.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.930
Good for him.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.348
I still don't know
what you're doing back here.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.350
I already told you
everything I know.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.186
Not everything. It's time you
gave us the name of your source.

03:47.187 --> 03:48.896
Uh-uh.

03:48.897 --> 03:50.814
The deal is that money
goes into my daughter's account,

03:50.815 --> 03:52.399
then you get the name.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.651
What the hell is this?
- It's a down payment.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.361
Down payment?
I don't think so.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.113
I want the whole thing.
- And if you think

03:58.114 --> 03:59.656
we're giving you half a million
without a name,

03:59.657 --> 04:01.200
then you're out of your mind.

04:01.201 --> 04:02.993
Then we are at what
they call an impasse,

04:02.994 --> 04:05.079
because I'm not giving you
that name without that money.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.663
And there isn't
gonna be any money

04:06.664 --> 04:08.415
if the judge
dismisses this case.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.167
What the hell
is he talking about?

04:10.168 --> 04:11.710
He's talking about the fact
that the other side

04:11.711 --> 04:13.378
filed a motion
to dismiss this thing.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.922
Goes to court tomorrow.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.255
If you don't give me
the name of your source,

04:16.257 --> 04:17.591
it's gonna get tossed.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.134
Bullshit
it's gonna get tossed.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.594
I already admitted to you
I took part in it.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.053
It's not enough.

04:22.055 --> 04:23.805
Why is that not enough?
You got my word.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.473
We got no corroboration
of your word.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.892
What's to say you didn't
make up this whole thing

04:26.893 --> 04:28.309
when I came in here?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.853
Then go to
the goddamn prosecutor

04:29.854 --> 04:31.230
I went to seven years ago.

04:31.231 --> 04:32.731
She's got it all on record.

04:32.732 --> 04:34.315
I thought she didn't
pursue this case.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.068
Then you didn't
hear me right.

04:36.069 --> 04:37.861
She pursued it. She just
didn't want to see it through.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.821
Ask her if I'm telling
the truth.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.241
In the meantime,
keep your pocket change,

04:42.242 --> 04:44.743

05:25.161 --> 05:27.287
Hey, buddy.

05:27.288 --> 05:28.830
Louis, I was just
making a cup of coffee.

05:28.831 --> 05:30.790
I'm not taking
any time off, I swear.

05:30.791 --> 05:34.334
Whoa, Brian, it's okay to
take a break every now and then.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.671
- It is?
- Yeah, absolutely.

05:36.672 --> 05:39.299
In fact, coffee preparation
is very important.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.426
Yeah. Actually, making coffee
is one of my favorite hobb--

05:42.427 --> 05:44.012
That's great. Listen to me,
I need to ask you something.

05:44.013 --> 05:46.306
The other day when
I said those things to you

05:46.307 --> 05:47.974
about taking time off,
I mean, I don't even know

05:47.975 --> 05:50.143
if you remember it.
- Like it was yesterday.

05:50.144 --> 05:54.063
Well, in that case
I was just wondering...

05:54.064 --> 05:56.356
how bad was I?

05:56.357 --> 05:58.527
You weren't that bad.

06:01.989 --> 06:04.032
Good.

06:04.033 --> 06:08.328
Now, would you be willing
to swear to that in court?

06:08.329 --> 06:10.370
- What? Why?
- No reason.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.291
Truth is, my recollection is
exactly the same as yours.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.793
You asked for a couple days off,
and I gave it to you.

06:15.794 --> 06:17.461
See, I even wrote it
in my diary.

06:17.462 --> 06:19.255
“Gave Brian two days off.
Felt good about it.”

06:19.256 --> 06:21.216
It looks like you just
wrote that today.

06:21.217 --> 06:23.176
- What makes you say that?
- It has today's date on top.

06:23.177 --> 06:26.470
I just wrote that down to
remember today's conversation.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.181
Can I go back to work now?

06:28.182 --> 06:30.766
Yep, just make sure you have
the affidavit on my desk

06:30.767 --> 06:32.853
as soon as possible.

06:35.064 --> 06:37.815
Thanks for seeing us on such
short notice, Ms. Randolph.

06:37.816 --> 06:39.734
I have to say, when I heard
the name Frank Gallo,

06:39.735 --> 06:41.903
my interest was piqued.
What's this about?

06:41.904 --> 06:43.821
We're representing
a class of prisoners

06:43.822 --> 06:46.282
suing Reform Corporation
for abusive practices.

06:46.283 --> 06:48.450
We're here to confirm that
Frank Gallo came to see you

06:48.451 --> 06:51.037
seven years ago and admitted to
being involved in a conspiracy.

06:51.038 --> 06:53.831
Yeah, he came to me offering
to be an informant

06:53.832 --> 06:56.334
in exchange for protection from
what was going on in Lambert.

06:56.335 --> 06:58.169
And did you believe
what he told you?

06:58.170 --> 07:00.046
Of course I believed him.
He was beaten up,

07:00.047 --> 07:01.463
and he'd been in the infirmary
for two goddamn weeks.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.965
Well, if you believed him,

07:02.966 --> 07:04.675
why the hell didn't you
pursue the case?

07:04.676 --> 07:06.426
I did pursue it.
I ran it up the flagpole,

07:06.427 --> 07:08.512
and it came back down
like a concrete block.

07:08.513 --> 07:10.181
No one gives a shit
about prisoners

07:10.182 --> 07:12.016
or the way they're treated.

07:12.017 --> 07:14.018
So, instead, he offered to
inform on his fellow inmates,

07:14.019 --> 07:16.229
and then he used that to get
himself transferred.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.981
Exactly.
Now, if you don't mind.

07:18.982 --> 07:21.025
Well, Danielle,
in fact, I do mind.

07:21.026 --> 07:23.485
You see, I do give a shit
about how prisoners are treated,

07:23.486 --> 07:26.614
which means you
are gonna tell the court

07:26.615 --> 07:28.574
exactly what you just told us.

07:28.575 --> 07:30.826
Did you not hear
what I just said?

07:30.827 --> 07:33.788
It came back down on me
like a concrete block.

07:33.789 --> 07:35.664
This is my career. I--

07:35.665 --> 07:38.084
I am not gonna go on record
and jeopardize it.

07:38.085 --> 07:40.044
Well, then this is gonna
go one of two ways.

07:40.045 --> 07:42.297
You give us your records,
and we submit them quietly...

07:42.298 --> 07:43.798
Or we subpoena your records

07:43.799 --> 07:45.133
under the Freedom
of Information Act

07:45.134 --> 07:46.842
and put you on the stand.

07:46.843 --> 07:48.552
And seeing as you're afraid
of ruining your career,

07:48.553 --> 07:49.845
I suggest you go
with option A.

07:51.598 --> 07:53.975
You're a couple
of little shits.

07:53.976 --> 07:56.352
Good, you're here.

07:56.353 --> 07:58.229
Listen, there's something
I've been wanting

07:58.230 --> 07:59.563
to talk to you about.

07:59.564 --> 08:00.940
Harvey, it's gonna
have to wait.

08:00.941 --> 08:02.691
Donna, it's important.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.277
Frank Gallo left a message
for you a few minutes ago.

08:04.278 --> 08:06.028
- What did he say?
- He said you and Mike

08:06.029 --> 08:07.905
better not be trying
to screw him over again,

08:07.906 --> 08:09.865
or you're gonna regret it.

08:09.866 --> 08:11.700
Harvey, what's
he talking about?

08:11.701 --> 08:14.287
I don't know, but I'm sure
as hell gonna find out.

08:17.791 --> 08:20.752
What the hell are you
doing with Frank Gallo?

08:22.671 --> 08:24.046
Harvey--

08:24.047 --> 08:25.840
Don't pretend
like you don't know.

08:25.841 --> 08:27.758
He just left me a message
asking me to make sure

08:27.759 --> 08:29.677
that you don't fuck him over.

08:29.678 --> 08:32.054
I told you, I'm working on a
Brooklyn Housing Authority case.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.182
Gallo is from Brooklyn.
He knows people.

08:34.183 --> 08:36.183
And don't tell me he's making
you pay for his information.

08:36.184 --> 08:38.811
Yes, he is,
and I'm gonna pay him.

08:38.812 --> 08:41.522
Mike, odds are
he doesn't know jack shit

08:41.523 --> 08:43.107
and he's just using you
to get money.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.067
No, I looked into it,
all right?

08:45.068 --> 08:46.986
What he told me checks out. He's
on the right side of this thing.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.489
You're telling me he's
all of a sudden Mother Teresa?

08:49.490 --> 08:51.115
This guy tried to kill you!

08:51.116 --> 08:52.950
I know that. Look,
I'm not saying he's a saint.

08:52.951 --> 08:54.535
I'm saying that I know
what I'm doing.

08:54.536 --> 08:56.287
Don't you get it?

08:56.288 --> 08:59.748
A guy like Gallo finds people
to get revenge on.

08:59.749 --> 09:01.667
He thinks about it
and thinks about it,

09:01.668 --> 09:04.086
and the only way
to survive that

09:04.087 --> 09:07.089
is to stay out of his mind
and let him find someone else.

09:07.090 --> 09:09.050
Maybe you're right,
but I already promised him

09:09.051 --> 09:11.552
something for his information,
and if I back out of that now,

09:11.553 --> 09:14.180
I'm gonna end up
on the top of his list.

09:14.181 --> 09:16.724
Does Rachel know
about this?

09:19.353 --> 09:20.895
- No.
- Then you better hope

09:20.896 --> 09:22.438
Gallo doesn't leave
her a message

09:22.439 --> 09:24.399
the same way
he left me one.

09:29.738 --> 09:31.947
Staring
out the window, Louis?

09:31.948 --> 09:33.782
That's a sign that
something's going on.

09:33.783 --> 09:35.410
Nothing's going on, Rachel.

09:35.411 --> 09:37.328
Then why exactly
did you make Brian Altman

09:37.329 --> 09:39.372
relive that horrible day?

09:39.373 --> 09:41.332
- Which horrible day?
- The one where you

09:41.333 --> 09:43.167
treated him like shit because
you were losing your mind.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.502
That day.

09:44.503 --> 09:46.087
You want to know
what's going on?

09:46.088 --> 09:48.714
I'm being sued.
That's what's going on.

09:48.715 --> 09:50.883
- By Brian?
- No, by Stephanie.

09:50.884 --> 09:53.511
For sexual harassment?
Louis, this is bad.

09:53.512 --> 09:55.596
- I know what it is, Rachel.
- Well, then we need to talk

09:55.597 --> 09:57.432
about how
you're gonna handle it.

09:57.433 --> 09:58.807
No, we need to talk about
how you're gonna handle it.

09:58.808 --> 10:00.017
Louis, that's not
a good idea.

10:00.018 --> 10:01.894
It's the only good idea.

10:01.895 --> 10:03.687
You need to go over there right
now and put an end to this.

10:03.688 --> 10:05.440
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

10:05.441 --> 10:07.483
Because I had a run-in
with Stephanie after you did,

10:07.484 --> 10:09.360
and then I had another run-in
with her after Donna fired her.

10:09.361 --> 10:11.153
She's not gonna listen to me.

10:11.154 --> 10:12.572
It is sexual harassment,
Rachel.

10:12.573 --> 10:14.240
I cannot have it
on my record.

10:14.241 --> 10:16.075
Someone needs to convince her
to let this go,

10:16.076 --> 10:17.910
and it needs to be
a lawyer I can trust,

10:17.911 --> 10:20.079
but it also needs to be someone
who's close to her level,

10:20.080 --> 10:21.914
or she's gonna feel attacked.

10:21.915 --> 10:25.127
Then I think I have
the perfect choice.

10:30.048 --> 10:32.508
Katrina.

10:32.509 --> 10:34.594
I take it Louis
got my lawsuit.

10:34.595 --> 10:38.013
He did, and I'm here to ask
why you're bringing it now.

10:38.014 --> 10:40.308
Because the things
you're alleging he said--

10:40.309 --> 10:42.726
Alleging he said?

10:42.727 --> 10:46.855
Wow. I guess it's lawyer first,
friend second.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.024
That's not fair. I'm only
here because we're friends.

10:49.025 --> 10:50.943
And because you wanted
to convince me to forget

10:50.944 --> 10:53.070
that Pearson Specter Litt
ruined my career.

10:53.071 --> 10:55.781
Stephanie,
I know you got fired,

10:55.782 --> 10:59.619
but this lawsuit
could destroy Louis.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.287
Let me get this straight.

11:01.288 --> 11:03.372
The woman who convinced me
to leave a good job

11:03.373 --> 11:05.249
for one where I was
treated terribly,

11:05.250 --> 11:07.168
sexually harassed,
and then fired

11:07.169 --> 11:09.795
is now asking me
for a personal favor?

11:09.796 --> 11:12.465
Yes, I am.

11:16.052 --> 11:18.846
Well, I'm not in the mood
to grant one.

11:18.847 --> 11:23.434
So you can tell Louis
I will see him in court.

11:23.435 --> 11:25.186
Stephanie, the woman I knew

11:25.187 --> 11:27.313
at Rand Kaldor Zane
wouldn't do this.

11:27.314 --> 11:30.024
Please...

11:30.025 --> 11:32.109
tell me what's going on
so I can help.

11:35.322 --> 11:37.239
I heard people here talking,

11:37.240 --> 11:40.868
and they said that I got fired
because I couldn't hack it.

11:40.869 --> 11:43.663
Well, that's not true,

11:43.664 --> 11:46.207
and I won't have them
thinking it is.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.916
Then close that door
and sit down,

11:47.917 --> 11:49.627
because I'm betting that
we can work out a deal

11:49.628 --> 11:52.338
right now
that shows anyone

11:52.339 --> 11:55.634
who's ever underestimated you
just how strong you are.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.638
Alex, have you seen Donna
by any chance?

12:00.639 --> 12:03.140
- What?
- Donna. Have you seen her?

12:03.141 --> 12:05.059
I need to tell her something.
- I don't know, Harvey.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.852
I don't have time to track
your former secretary's

12:06.853 --> 12:08.229
every damn move.

12:08.230 --> 12:09.855
What the hell's
wrong with you?

12:09.856 --> 12:11.691
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

12:11.692 --> 12:13.442
Masterson Construction's
pissed about this prison case.

12:13.443 --> 12:15.861
Still? You handed it off
like they asked.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.613
No, they wanted the thing
gone, not handed off,

12:17.614 --> 12:19.198
and now it's turned
into a class action,

12:19.199 --> 12:21.200
and it's going
to trial tomorrow.

12:21.201 --> 12:23.869
Listen to me, it's not your
job to make this thing go away.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.580
Harvey, I'm their attorney.
They had a problem,

12:25.581 --> 12:27.289
they wanted it fixed,
and I didn't fix it.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.083
Bullshit, you got
Pearson Specter to drop it

12:29.084 --> 12:31.126
like a hot potato.
That's all you could've done.

12:31.127 --> 12:33.170
No, what I could have done
was kill the whole damn thing.

12:33.171 --> 12:35.631
And since I didn't, they found
some inmate at another prison

12:35.632 --> 12:37.174
to break the case wide open,

12:37.175 --> 12:39.843
which is why I just had
to eat a ton of shit.

12:39.844 --> 12:42.346
- What did you just say?
- I said they found a witness

12:42.347 --> 12:46.267
at another prison, and now I'm
gonna lost my goddamn client.

12:46.268 --> 12:47.685
Where you going?

12:47.686 --> 12:50.229
Like I said,
I need to find Donna.

12:54.109 --> 12:59.238
I want to know right now,
do you know where Mike is?

12:59.239 --> 13:01.907
- No, I don't.
- You don't know where,

13:01.908 --> 13:03.825
or you don't know
what case he's working on?

13:03.826 --> 13:05.453
I don't know either one,
but if you calm down,

13:05.454 --> 13:07.121
then maybe I can help you
find him.

13:07.122 --> 13:09.498
No, Rachel, I don't want
help finding him

13:09.499 --> 13:11.500
In fact, I don't want you
telling him

13:11.501 --> 13:13.669
I was looking for him at all.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:22.890 --> 13:25.808
- Oscar Reyes?
- Yes.

13:25.809 --> 13:28.019
My name is Harvey Specter.
It's come to my attention

13:28.020 --> 13:31.022
that you're filing
a class-action lawsuit.

13:31.023 --> 13:33.400
We are.
How can I help you?

13:33.401 --> 13:35.360
Our pro Bono work
means a lot to us.

13:35.361 --> 13:38.029
We take it very seriously,

13:38.030 --> 13:40.198
and I have a very difficult
question to ask you.

13:40.199 --> 13:42.117
- What is it?
- I need to know

13:42.118 --> 13:44.161
if you're happy with the way
your case is being handled,

13:44.162 --> 13:46.413
because if Mike Ross
isn't doing everything he can

13:46.414 --> 13:47.872
to help you--
- Stop right there.

13:47.873 --> 13:49.708
Mr. Ross has dedicated himself

13:49.709 --> 13:51.752
to finding justice
for my son.

13:51.753 --> 13:54.171
And not only that,
when I was offered a settlement,

13:54.172 --> 13:56.757
he convinced me to turn it down
and find out the real truth,

13:56.758 --> 13:59.760
so you tell whoever's in charge
that I don't want anyone else

13:59.761 --> 14:04.139
working on this case
other than Mike and Oliver.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.558
Thank you.

14:09.895 --> 14:12.314
You gave me your word
you'd stay the hell

14:12.315 --> 14:14.149
out of that prison case.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.734
- Harvey, I--
- You're gonna stand there

14:15.735 --> 14:17.528
and tell me
you're not working on it?

14:17.529 --> 14:19.780
Because Oscar Reyes
told me you deserve a medal

14:19.781 --> 14:21.490
for what you're doing for him.

14:21.491 --> 14:23.367
Harvey, I meant to let
the clinic handle it, okay?

14:23.368 --> 14:25.118
It just turned out
that this thing

14:25.119 --> 14:26.870
was bigger than we thought.
- I don't give a shit

14:26.871 --> 14:29.540
if it turned into
the trial of the century.

14:29.541 --> 14:30.874
We had an agreement.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.376
No, you had an agreement
with Alex,

14:32.377 --> 14:34.085
and then I agreed
to sign a document,

14:34.086 --> 14:36.046
but as it turns out,
stopping corruption

14:36.047 --> 14:37.964
is more important to me
than some client's bottom line.

14:37.965 --> 14:41.176
Then grow the hell up,
because that ends now.

14:41.177 --> 14:44.179
Harvey, I have
to see this through.

14:44.180 --> 14:47.558
See this through?
Are you out of your mind?

14:47.559 --> 14:50.227
You think I don't know this is
what Gallo was helping you with?

14:50.228 --> 14:53.021
I told you, Gallo is not
gonna be a problem.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.106
And I told you guys like Gallo
are always a problem.

14:55.107 --> 14:56.734
Yeah, and what about
what I told you happens

14:56.735 --> 14:58.985
if I go back on my word
with him now?

14:58.986 --> 15:00.945
Or what you said about what
happens if he calls Rachel.

15:00.946 --> 15:03.281
Were you lying
when you said you'd pay him

15:03.282 --> 15:05.033
if he came through for you?
- No, I wasn't.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.744
Then pay him right now.

15:06.745 --> 15:08.537
You can take it out of my
pocket, but you're done.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.205
- Harvey, it's not--
- No, listen to me because

15:10.206 --> 15:12.332
I don't want there to be
any misunderstanding.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.834
You spend one more minute
on this case,

15:13.835 --> 15:15.711
other than telling
Oliver it's his,

15:15.712 --> 15:17.421
I'm shutting you down.
- What the hell does that mean?

15:17.422 --> 15:19.339
It means I'm going
to the hearing tomorrow

15:19.340 --> 15:21.216
and telling them that
you broke your agreement.

15:21.217 --> 15:22.885
And I don't care
who the judge is,

15:22.886 --> 15:24.678
they'll toss the clinic
off the case,

15:24.679 --> 15:27.431
and your friend Oscar
won't get a dime.

15:32.812 --> 15:35.773
Louis, stop blending!
I have news.

15:35.774 --> 15:37.065
Katrina,
thank God you're back.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.067
Here, have a prunie.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.486
Exactly how many prunies
did you make?

15:41.487 --> 15:42.863
I don't know.
I'm stress blending.

15:42.864 --> 15:44.489
If I don't hear
some good news soon,

15:44.490 --> 15:46.032
there's gonna be
an international prune shortage.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.659
So please tell me
that you talked Stephanie

15:47.660 --> 15:49.160
out of this bullshit.

15:49.161 --> 15:50.788
Louis, I couldn't
talk her out of it,

15:50.789 --> 15:53.749
but I did manage to
talk her into this.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.918
Okay, well, I can live
with this amount.

15:55.919 --> 15:58.670
But this says that I admit
to sexually harassing her.

15:58.671 --> 16:00.839
- You did sexually harass her.
- Oh, that's a load of crap.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.883
I never hit
on Stephanie Patel.

16:02.884 --> 16:04.885
And that's not the definition
of harassment, and you know it.

16:04.886 --> 16:06.553
Well, I don't care.
I can't accept it.

16:06.554 --> 16:08.346
- Why not?
- Because I've been sued

16:08.347 --> 16:10.056
for sexual harassment before,
and I can't have it look

16:10.057 --> 16:12.476
like a pattern.

16:12.477 --> 16:14.770
I didn't know.

16:14.771 --> 16:17.522
It was before your time,
and it was a bullshit suit

16:17.523 --> 16:20.108
concocted by Daniel Hardman.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.068
I can't have
a reputation for this.

16:22.069 --> 16:24.404
I understand that, Louis,
but Stephanie is worried

16:24.405 --> 16:26.323
people think
she can't hack it as a lawyer,

16:26.324 --> 16:29.993
and making you admit
to what you did

16:29.994 --> 16:32.537
is the only way she sees
to make them think otherwise.

16:32.538 --> 16:34.624
I'm sorry.
I can't sign it.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.252
Louis, I know
this isn't what you wanted,

16:39.253 --> 16:40.671
but in my professional opinion,

16:40.672 --> 16:42.881
this is the best
you're going to do.

16:42.882 --> 16:44.842
At least take a day
to think about it.

16:44.843 --> 16:48.136
And, Louis,
this goes without saying,

16:48.137 --> 16:51.598
but however tempted you are,
don't go see Stephanie.

17:00.399 --> 17:01.859
Hey.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.194
Don't “hey” me.

17:07.656 --> 17:11.993
I take it you heard about what
happened between me and Harvey.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.662
I take you didn't hear

17:13.663 --> 17:16.330
about what happened
between me and Harvey.

17:16.332 --> 17:18.082
Rachel,
what did he tell you?

17:18.083 --> 17:19.960
He didn't tell me anything.

17:19.961 --> 17:22.127
He asked me where you were
and what you were working on,

17:22.128 --> 17:23.547
and I had to lie to his face.

17:23.548 --> 17:25.173
- Rachel, I--
- Did you hear me?

17:25.174 --> 17:27.759
I had to lie
to Harvey's face.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.386
Yes, I heard you,
and I'm sorry.

17:29.387 --> 17:31.346
I don't want to
hear “I'm sorry.”

17:31.347 --> 17:33.515
I want to hear that you're
dropping this goddamn thing.

17:33.516 --> 17:35.099
- Rachel, I--
- No excuses.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.685
You said it's your word
to Oscar Reyes

17:36.686 --> 17:37.853
that mattered to you.

17:37.854 --> 17:39.396
Well, you know what, Mike?

17:39.397 --> 17:40.981
You need to get
your priorities straight,

17:40.982 --> 17:42.900
because my word
became nothing today,

17:42.901 --> 17:44.902
and I don't ever want to be
put in that position again.

17:44.903 --> 17:46.653
So it's up to you.
You either go and work

17:46.654 --> 17:48.864
at the clinic or you stay
at Pearson Specter,

17:48.865 --> 17:51.491
but what you can't do anymore
is play them both for fools

17:51.492 --> 17:53.827
and put me in the middle.

17:53.828 --> 17:55.704
I'm gonna go now,
and when I come back,

17:55.705 --> 17:57.622
you can let me know
what you've decided.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.936
Oh, hey, you.

18:09.937 --> 18:11.605
Paula, what are you
doing here?

18:11.606 --> 18:13.106
I was in the neighborhood,

18:13.107 --> 18:15.025
and I was thinking maybe
we could get dinner.

18:15.026 --> 18:16.527
Listen, I'm sorry,

18:16.528 --> 18:18.529
but I am just not
in the mood tonight.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.656
I'm sorry.

18:20.657 --> 18:22.449
Does this have something
to do with how it went

18:22.450 --> 18:24.201
when you told Donna about us?

18:24.202 --> 18:26.370
What? No.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.622
I didn't even get
a chance to tell her.

18:28.623 --> 18:30.416
Well, what does that mean,
you didn't get the chance?

18:30.417 --> 18:33.419
It means I went to tell her,
but something came up.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.837
What exactly came up?

18:34.838 --> 18:36.547
What does it matter
what came up?

18:36.548 --> 18:38.424
Well, I'm just wondering
what was so important

18:38.425 --> 18:40.551
that you couldn't find the time
to tell her the entire day.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.762
Well, if you really
need to know,

18:42.763 --> 18:44.889
a murderer turns out
to be working with Mike

18:44.890 --> 18:46.682
on a case he swore to me
he wouldn't be working on.

18:46.683 --> 18:49.184
I spent the entire day
trying to fix it.

18:49.185 --> 18:50.770
And I thought
it was more important

18:50.771 --> 18:53.146
than telling Donna
about my love life.

18:53.147 --> 18:54.940
I'm sorry I asked.

18:54.941 --> 18:56.776
Look, I didn't mean
to overreact.

18:56.777 --> 18:58.736
I've just had
a hell of a day,

18:58.737 --> 19:01.530
and I'll tell her tomorrow,
I promise.

19:01.531 --> 19:04.825
Harvey, you don't
need to promise me anything.

19:04.826 --> 19:07.077
In fact, I'd like to stay
out of it entirely,

19:07.078 --> 19:08.161
if you don't mind.

19:08.162 --> 19:09.955
- Paula--
- No, it's fine.

19:09.956 --> 19:12.625
Because, you know, I'm not
the one that brought it up.

19:12.626 --> 19:14.627
And, frankly, I don't
like you behaving as though

19:14.628 --> 19:16.295
I'm the one
making you do this.

19:16.296 --> 19:17.838
What's going on here?

19:17.839 --> 19:19.506
What's going on here
is you're rather keen

19:19.507 --> 19:21.884
on keeping our relationship
a secret from Donna...

19:21.885 --> 19:23.803
when you clearly had
no trouble telling Louis.

19:23.804 --> 19:25.846
Are you worried that
I have feelings for her?

19:25.847 --> 19:27.556
Of course you have
feelings for her.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.850
You started having panic attacks
after she left you.

19:29.851 --> 19:31.184
We wouldn't even
know each other

19:31.185 --> 19:32.812
if it weren't
for those feelings.

19:32.813 --> 19:34.688
- Then what are you saying?
- I don't know.

19:34.689 --> 19:36.649
Maybe you don't want to
tell her because you like being

19:36.650 --> 19:38.233
the object of her
attention and affection,

19:38.234 --> 19:39.860
and you're worried
this will change that.

19:39.861 --> 19:41.320
Her attention and affection?

19:41.321 --> 19:43.113
Would you like me
to say it, Harvey?

19:43.114 --> 19:44.531
She loves you.

19:44.532 --> 19:46.325
At least part of her does,

19:46.326 --> 19:49.161
and maybe part of you likes it
and doesn't want it to stop.

19:49.162 --> 19:51.163
And we wouldn't
even be discussing this

19:51.164 --> 19:52.998
if you had the courage
to tell Donna the truth

19:52.999 --> 19:54.875
and let her move on.
- You know, for someone

19:54.876 --> 19:56.961
who didn't want to be
involved in this anymore,

19:56.962 --> 19:59.630
you sure have
a hell of a lot to say.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.507
Then I'll say
one more thing.

20:01.508 --> 20:03.801
If what I'm saying is wrong,
then you won't have any trouble

20:03.802 --> 20:06.094
telling Donna in the morning.

20:11.726 --> 20:13.686
Mike, where
the hell have you been?

20:13.687 --> 20:15.187
The motion to dismiss
is tomorrow.

20:15.188 --> 20:16.563
I need to go over everything--

20:16.564 --> 20:18.273
Oliver, I can't
help you anymore.

20:18.274 --> 20:19.775
What?

20:19.776 --> 20:21.193
I said I can't work
the case anymore.

20:21.194 --> 20:22.569
Why the hell not?

20:22.570 --> 20:24.655
‘Cause Harvey found out.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.365
Shit, are you--

20:26.366 --> 20:28.701
He's not gonna hand us in,
but he did make it clear

20:28.702 --> 20:30.536
that if I spent
another second on this case

20:30.537 --> 20:32.329
that he'll pull the plug
on the whole damn thing.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.957
I don't believe this.
I mean, you come here

20:34.958 --> 20:37.125
and you drop this bomb on me
the night before we go to court.

20:37.126 --> 20:39.127
Oliver, it's not a bomb.
You knew all along

20:39.128 --> 20:40.796
you were gonna have
to do this on your own.

20:40.797 --> 20:42.589
I knew you wouldn't
be up there next to me,

20:42.590 --> 20:44.257
but I was counting on you
helping me to prepare.

20:44.258 --> 20:45.759
- Oliver--
- Son of a bitch, Mike!

20:45.760 --> 20:47.678
You know what happens to me!

20:47.679 --> 20:50.222
It happened last time, and now
it's gonna happen tomorrow

20:50.223 --> 20:51.932
because you're goddamn
hanging me out to dry!

20:51.933 --> 20:53.642
You know what, Oliver?
I have had it up to here

20:53.643 --> 20:56.603
with you blaming me
for every choice that you make.

20:56.604 --> 20:58.772
You knew there would come
a time when you'd be up there

20:58.773 --> 21:00.858
by yourself when you
agreed to take this case.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.860
Now, last time we were
in this situation,

21:02.861 --> 21:05.654
I coddled you all night, and you
still dropped the goddamn ball.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.156
So, this time, we're gonna
prepare by me telling you

21:08.157 --> 21:09.950
to stop acting like
a little boy,

21:09.951 --> 21:13.037
start acting like a man,
and get the goddamn job done!

21:13.038 --> 21:16.707
Because if you don't,
Oscar and those prisoners,

21:16.708 --> 21:19.418
they're gonna be left
with nothing.

21:23.006 --> 21:26.592
Thank you.

21:26.593 --> 21:29.595
Stephanie.

21:29.596 --> 21:32.389
Stephanie.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.933
What are you doing here?

21:33.934 --> 21:35.851
I've been thinking
about your offer,

21:35.852 --> 21:37.686
and I was hoping
we could talk.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.064
Well, we can't because
we're on opposite sides

21:40.065 --> 21:41.815
of a lawsuit.
- I know that,

21:41.816 --> 21:43.817
and I'm willing to sign
whatever you want.

21:43.818 --> 21:45.652
I'm willing to pay
whatever you want.

21:45.653 --> 21:47.947
I just can't admit
that I--

21:47.948 --> 21:51.324
Did exactly what you did.

21:51.325 --> 21:52.701
Too bad.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.160
Because if you won't admit it,

21:54.161 --> 21:55.788
I'll make a jury
admit it for you.

21:55.789 --> 21:57.581
Stephanie, I'm trying
to be reasonable here.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.332
Well, maybe you should
have thought of that

21:59.333 --> 22:01.085
before putting yourself
in a position

22:01.086 --> 22:04.254
to let a lowly associate
wipe the floor with you.

22:04.255 --> 22:06.673
Wipe the--My reputation
is that of a pillar

22:06.674 --> 22:08.133
of the legal community,

22:08.134 --> 22:10.510
so you're not wiping
the floor with shit.

22:10.511 --> 22:12.012
Your reputation is that
you're a son of a bitch,

22:12.013 --> 22:13.931
and I'm gonna prove it
to the world.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.016
No, Stephanie, the only thing
you're gonna prove is that

22:16.017 --> 22:18.644
you're the pathetic loser
that everyone thinks you are,

22:18.645 --> 22:20.144
because you just picked a fight

22:20.145 --> 22:22.106
with someone who is way
out of your league!

22:22.107 --> 22:24.232
What delusional reality
are you living in?

22:24.233 --> 22:26.276
The one where I make it
crystal clear at trial

22:26.277 --> 22:27.694
that you were fired for cause

22:27.695 --> 22:29.571
and concocted this lawsuit
out of spite.

22:29.572 --> 22:31.155
I didn't concoct

22:31.156 --> 22:33.867
a room full of witnesses
who saw and heard

22:33.868 --> 22:35.702
the real Louis Litt.

22:35.703 --> 22:37.788
So the way I see it, you're
gonna owe me so much money,

22:37.789 --> 22:40.916
I'm never gonna need
another job again.

22:48.049 --> 22:49.591
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

22:49.592 --> 22:51.259
Can't a managing partner
have a drink

22:51.260 --> 22:53.261
with his favorite COO
every once in a while?

22:53.262 --> 22:56.140
He can, but I got
a ton of work to do,

22:56.141 --> 22:58.935
and I'd like to get home
before midnight.

23:00.561 --> 23:03.856
There's something
I need to tell you.

23:03.857 --> 23:05.941
Harvey, what's going on?

23:05.942 --> 23:08.068
I've been seeing
Paula Agard.

23:08.069 --> 23:12.322
And not as
my therapist anymore.

23:12.323 --> 23:15.159
We've been seeing each other.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.244
What?
- What do you mean what?

23:18.245 --> 23:21.205
I'm just amused
that you think I didn't know.

23:21.206 --> 23:22.582
Donna.

23:22.583 --> 23:24.208
The day you made
managing partner,

23:24.209 --> 23:26.503
you drove yourself to work,
not in the red car,

23:26.504 --> 23:28.296
but in the black
Ferrari Daytona.

23:28.297 --> 23:30.507
And on top of that,
you told me and Louis

23:30.508 --> 23:32.551
that you had things
to take care of that night,

23:32.552 --> 23:34.553
but I know your schedule,

23:34.554 --> 23:37.221
and I know what happened
was you drove yourself

23:37.222 --> 23:39.808
straight home from the office,
you changed into whatever outfit

23:39.809 --> 23:41.685
you thought would impress
her the most,

23:41.686 --> 23:43.687
and then you went right over
to her house,

23:43.688 --> 23:47.066
and you swept her
off her feet.

23:47.067 --> 23:49.068
But you just asked me
the other night if something

23:49.069 --> 23:50.652
was going on because
I've been acting different.

23:50.653 --> 23:52.362
‘Cause I was trying
to get you to open up,

23:52.363 --> 23:54.156
but you missed the signal,

23:54.157 --> 23:57.117
so I figured I'd just keep on
waiting, and here you are,

23:57.118 --> 23:58.577
more or less
right on time.

23:58.578 --> 24:01.413
- More or less?
- Well, I was giving you

24:01.414 --> 24:03.874
until tomorrow, so you're
actually ahead of schedule.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.334
Well, that was
Paula's doing.

24:06.335 --> 24:08.921
I'm happy for you, Harvey,
and I want to hear all about it,

24:08.922 --> 24:10.923
but like I said,
I've got a ton of work to do,

24:10.924 --> 24:12.758
and I want to get home
before midnight, so...

24:12.759 --> 24:15.302
Go on, finish.
We'll talk later.

24:17.513 --> 24:20.724
I'm glad you finally told me.

24:20.725 --> 24:24.811
Thanks, Donna.
Me too.

24:36.365 --> 24:37.991
Donna, are you okay?

24:37.992 --> 24:40.787
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

24:43.288 --> 24:46.332
I don't know. I...

24:46.333 --> 24:47.918
I just got some news

24:47.919 --> 24:50.003
I should have seen coming,
and I didn't.

24:50.004 --> 24:52.005
Do you want
to talk about it?

24:52.006 --> 24:55.341
No, I don't.
I'll--I'll be fine.

24:55.342 --> 24:57.636
Well, I just got some news

24:57.637 --> 24:59.846
that we should have seen coming
but didn't,

24:59.847 --> 25:01.181
and it's not good.

25:01.182 --> 25:03.142
What is it?

25:03.143 --> 25:06.394
We've just been subpoenaed
to testify against Louis.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.874
What's that?

25:17.875 --> 25:19.626
Moo shu pork
and fried rice.

25:19.627 --> 25:21.210
The way I treated you before,

25:21.211 --> 25:23.671
I wasn't sure
if you'd eaten yet.

25:23.672 --> 25:25.172
- Harvey--
- And I was thinking

25:25.173 --> 25:27.008
that maybe we could eat

25:27.009 --> 25:28.509
while I tell you
that I'm sorry

25:28.510 --> 25:31.262
and that I told Donna.

25:31.263 --> 25:34.139
- You told her?
- Yes. You were right.

25:34.140 --> 25:37.727
I needed to tell her,
and it was unfair to her,

25:37.728 --> 25:39.562
and it was unfair to you.

25:39.563 --> 25:42.189
- I never said that.
- No, but you meant it.

25:42.190 --> 25:44.484
Harvey, if you're not careful,
you're gonna become

25:44.485 --> 25:46.820
a full-fledged
outstanding boyfriend.

25:46.821 --> 25:49.030
Boyfriend?

25:49.031 --> 25:51.365
Boyfriend.

25:51.366 --> 25:53.785
Then I'll try
not to be careful.

25:55.245 --> 25:56.914
Come in.

26:00.709 --> 26:03.711
By the way,
how did she take it?

26:03.712 --> 26:06.422
She was fine.

26:06.423 --> 26:08.424
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26:08.425 --> 26:10.260
Turned out
she already knew.

26:13.179 --> 26:16.265
Well, I'm glad
you told her.

26:16.266 --> 26:18.810
And I hope you got
some egg rolls in there.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.274
Katrina, hey.

26:25.275 --> 26:27.652
Louis, what the hell
did you do?

26:27.653 --> 26:28.987
I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.530
Then why were
Donna and Rachel

26:30.531 --> 26:32.157
slapped with subpoenas
last night?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.491
Katrina, listen to me--

26:33.492 --> 26:35.200
God damn it, Louis!

26:35.201 --> 26:36.661
How long did you wait
to go over there

26:36.662 --> 26:38.955
after I explicitly
told you not to?

26:38.956 --> 26:40.832
Well, you know what?
It doesn't matter,

26:40.833 --> 26:43.626
because now your job is to blow
that woman out of the water.

26:43.627 --> 26:45.170
Well, that's gonna be
pretty hard,

26:45.171 --> 26:47.212
since she has a room
full of witnesses

26:47.213 --> 26:49.382
and she also has Donna on record
saying what you did was wrong

26:49.383 --> 26:51.759
and that's why you lost
dominion over the associates.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.511
Whoa, Donna did what?

26:53.512 --> 26:56.181
She didn't know you were
going to get sued, Louis.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.266
And when Stephanie gets her
up on the stand, we're dead.

26:59.267 --> 27:00.852
Well, then she's just gonna
have to lie on the stand.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.603
Louis, that is insane,
and you know it.

27:02.604 --> 27:04.522
Well, God damn it,
we have to figure some way

27:04.523 --> 27:06.733
to get out of this, because
I have lost everything this year

27:06.734 --> 27:08.193
and I can't lose this.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.112
How about you tell her
you're sorry?

27:11.113 --> 27:12.780
What the hell
did you just say?

27:12.781 --> 27:14.782
I said tell her
that you're sorry.

27:14.783 --> 27:17.660
What are you even doing here?
Are you spying on us for her?

27:17.661 --> 27:21.122
No, um, I came to tell you
I'd been served with a subpoena.

27:21.123 --> 27:23.124
Well, Brian,
I don't need your help,

27:23.125 --> 27:25.418
because you can't apologize
without admitting guilt,

27:25.419 --> 27:28.629
which is the whole thing
that I don't want to do.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.507
Louis, I don't know
if you've noticed,

27:31.508 --> 27:34.219
but that's pretty much
going to happen anyway.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.679
If I may...

27:36.680 --> 27:39.933
it is admitting guilt,
and it is taking a chance,

27:39.934 --> 27:41.559
but if I were thinking
of suing you

27:41.560 --> 27:44.979
for the horrible things
you said to me...

27:44.980 --> 27:46.981
that's what I'd want to hear.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.746
What are you doing here?

28:01.747 --> 28:03.414
I thought you
weren't supposed to have

28:03.415 --> 28:05.166
anything to do
with this anymore.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.543
I'm not, but there's
nothing in that agreement

28:07.544 --> 28:09.545
that says I can't come watch
my friend Oliver

28:09.546 --> 28:12.297
kick some ass in court.

28:12.298 --> 28:14.050
Well, strap the hell in.

28:14.051 --> 28:16.052
‘Cause this motherfucker
is going down.

28:27.564 --> 28:29.607
May I come in?

28:29.608 --> 28:31.692
What do you want this time?

28:31.693 --> 28:34.403
Tell me I'm so worthless
I don't even deserve an office?

28:34.404 --> 28:36.239
I want to tell you I'm sorry,

28:36.240 --> 28:39.408
and if anyone's worthless,
it's me.

28:39.409 --> 28:41.410
Louis, if you think pretending
to give me an apology

28:41.411 --> 28:43.579
is gonna make me drop this suit,
you have another thing coming.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.498
I don't think that.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.960
I just think that
I owe you an explanation.

28:52.173 --> 28:55.508
You see...

28:55.509 --> 28:58.178
the night before

28:58.179 --> 29:00.805
I said those horrible
things to you,

29:00.806 --> 29:05.143
my fiancée left me.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.436
She was pregnant.

29:07.437 --> 29:13.109
And even though
the child wasn't mine...

29:13.110 --> 29:16.403
I was finally
gonna be a dad.

29:16.404 --> 29:18.447
And when all that went away,

29:18.448 --> 29:22.286
my entire life
turned upside down.

29:24.121 --> 29:26.247
I mean, I was reeling.

29:26.248 --> 29:29.583
So, when Brian had asked me
for time off

29:29.584 --> 29:32.628
to go have a baby

29:32.629 --> 29:34.797
and you defended him...

29:34.798 --> 29:37.300
You took everything
you were feeling out on me.

29:37.301 --> 29:40.678
Yeah, and I am ashamed
of that.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.805
Stephanie...

29:42.806 --> 29:44.390
I will sign
anything you want.

29:44.391 --> 29:47.310
I will say anything you need
to make sure

29:47.311 --> 29:49.812
that the world knows
that you are not a pushover,

29:49.813 --> 29:52.648
even if that includes
admitting guilt.

29:52.649 --> 29:55.735
And if for some reason they
still can't accept you here,

29:55.736 --> 29:58.905
you have your job back with us,
standing offer.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.617
I appreciate you
opening up to me, Louis.

30:03.618 --> 30:07.247
But this wasn't really about
people thinking I'm a pushover.

30:07.248 --> 30:09.040
It was about
how you made me feel

30:09.041 --> 30:10.583
when you said
those things to me.

30:10.584 --> 30:12.001
Why would they
make you feel anything?

30:12.002 --> 30:13.586
I mean, they were
so clearly untrue.

30:13.587 --> 30:16.339
- Were they?
- Come on.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.299
What are you talking about?
Stephanie...

30:18.300 --> 30:21.261
I'm 34 years old.
I work 90 hours a week.

30:21.262 --> 30:23.263
I don't have anyone.

30:23.264 --> 30:25.306
I don't have time
to meet anyone,

30:25.307 --> 30:27.516
and I'm worried
that I never will,

30:27.517 --> 30:29.727
that I--that I'll never
have a family.

30:29.728 --> 30:33.106
So, when you said no one would
want to have children with me...

30:33.107 --> 30:34.732
I am so sorry, Stephanie.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.320
Thank you, Louis.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.155
I feel like I want to come
over there and give you a hug,

30:41.156 --> 30:44.033
but it's probably inappropriate

30:44.034 --> 30:46.702
since you're suing me
for sexual harassment.

30:49.123 --> 30:51.540
I'm not suing you
anymore, Louis.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.712
Your Honor, this suit hinges
on the testimony

30:56.713 --> 30:58.589
of a convicted felon,

30:58.590 --> 31:00.674
not to mention the entire class
is made up of felons

31:00.675 --> 31:02.718
looking for a chance
to stick it to the prisons

31:02.719 --> 31:05.138
that did their duty
by incarcerating them.

31:05.139 --> 31:06.431
Your Honor,
this case doesn't hinge

31:06.432 --> 31:07.974
on the word of Frank Gallo.

31:07.975 --> 31:10.059
It hinges on the word
of a U.S. Attorney

31:10.060 --> 31:12.228
who had reason to suspect
abuses were taking place

31:12.229 --> 31:13.854
at these supposedly
upstanding prisons.

31:13.855 --> 31:15.648
Your Honor,
that file is inadmissible.

31:15.649 --> 31:17.483
We weren't presented with it
during discovery.

31:17.484 --> 31:20.027
Mr. Grady, if this
is some sort of end-around--

31:20.028 --> 31:21.821
Your Honor,
if you'll look at the file,

31:21.822 --> 31:23.739
you can see it was delivered
to me yesterday.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.033
So, unless opposing counsel
feels the U.S. Attorney

31:26.034 --> 31:29.329
was fabricating that date,
that file is admissible.

31:29.330 --> 31:31.038
Ms. Sterling,
unless you have another reason

31:31.039 --> 31:32.873
as to why this case
shouldn't move forward,

31:32.874 --> 31:34.708
I'm inclined to allow it.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.710
I have a compelling reason,
Your Honor.

31:36.711 --> 31:38.796
- And who are you?
- My name is Alex Williams.

31:38.797 --> 31:41.090
Your Honor, this man
has no standing in this case.

31:41.091 --> 31:43.384
I beg to differ, because
I have a binding agreement

31:43.385 --> 31:45.428
signing by his legal clinic
stating they would have

31:45.429 --> 31:47.347
no outside help
from Pearson Specter Litt

31:47.348 --> 31:49.849
on this case, yet they did.
- You have no proof of that.

31:49.850 --> 31:51.476
Then how about I put you
on the stand, swear you in,

31:51.477 --> 31:53.436
and ask you myself?
- There is no basis

31:53.437 --> 31:55.355
for you doing that, there is
no precedent for you doing that,

31:55.356 --> 31:57.315
and I'm not gonna get bullied
to getting up on the stand.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.233
And for the record, Your Honor,
the court cannot make

31:59.234 --> 32:01.444
any inferences based on me
choosing not to go up there.

32:01.445 --> 32:04.030
Then how about I put
Mike Ross on the stand?

32:04.031 --> 32:05.490
I notice he's sitting
right over there.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.991
I don't have
a subpoena for him,

32:06.992 --> 32:08.617
but I'm sure we can
whip one up.

32:08.618 --> 32:10.161
And when he gets up there,

32:10.162 --> 32:11.829
we'll see if he tells
the truth or not.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.747
- Your Honor--
- That's enough.

32:13.748 --> 32:15.582
Your Honor,
I violated the agreement.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.919
Then I have no other choice
but to dismiss this case.

32:28.805 --> 32:31.974
Hey. You okay?

32:31.975 --> 32:34.227
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

32:34.228 --> 32:36.312
First, the way you were
when I walked in last night

32:36.313 --> 32:39.565
and then how you were after
I told you about the subpoena.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.942
Well, I was just worried
about Louis, Rachel.

32:41.943 --> 32:43.944
He's being sued, and I feel
partially responsible

32:43.945 --> 32:45.612
because I'm the one
who admitted

32:45.613 --> 32:47.198
in front of the associates
that he was wrong.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.657
And I've known
you long enough to know

32:48.658 --> 32:51.245
when you're not
being straight with me.

32:59.961 --> 33:02.881
Harvey told me he's involved
with somebody last night.

33:04.550 --> 33:08.428
- Is it serious?
- Yes.

33:08.429 --> 33:11.680
And that's the news
you should have seen coming.

33:11.681 --> 33:14.767
- Yes.
- Donna, you're only human,

33:14.768 --> 33:17.603
and I know you have this
amazing ability to read people,

33:17.604 --> 33:19.897
but some things are gonna slip
by even you once in a while.

33:19.898 --> 33:23.692
This one didn't
slip by, Rachel.

33:23.693 --> 33:26.904
I didn't see it coming
‘cause I didn't want to see it.

33:29.616 --> 33:32.993
I've always said that I want
Harvey to be happy, and I do.

33:32.994 --> 33:34.454
But it bothers you.

33:34.455 --> 33:36.997
And I hate that it does.

33:38.959 --> 33:42.044
And then when he told me,
I pretended I already knew,

33:42.045 --> 33:44.213
and I hate that even more.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.967
I don't know what to say.

33:48.385 --> 33:51.471
I don't even know
what I'd want you to say.

33:51.472 --> 33:55.724
What do you say Michelle Ross
and Harriett Specter

33:55.725 --> 33:58.353
go out for a drink this week?

33:59.771 --> 34:03.567
Thanks, Rachel.
I'd like that.

34:05.655 --> 34:08.739
You told him, didn't you?

34:08.741 --> 34:10.283
What are you talking about?
Told who what?

34:10.284 --> 34:12.201
Don't bullshit me.
You told Alex

34:12.202 --> 34:13.745
I was working the prison case.
I didn't tell Alex shit.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.746
What I did was I told
you to drop it.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.456
And I did. I didn't spend
one more second working on it,

34:17.458 --> 34:18.875
just like you ordered me to.

34:18.876 --> 34:20.543
Then what the hell
is your problem?

34:20.543 --> 34:21.920
My problem is he just
showed up to the courtroom

34:21.920 --> 34:23.379
and blew up the case.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.755
He embarrassed us,
he embarrassed me,

34:24.757 --> 34:26.632
and he did it
in front of everyone.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.301
The courtroom? I thought
you said you weren't involved.

34:28.302 --> 34:30.219
I was sitting
in the back watching.

34:30.219 --> 34:31.763
There's no law against that,
and that is not the point.

34:31.764 --> 34:33.389
No, the point is
you went from A to Z

34:33.389 --> 34:34.933
and assumed
that I told him.

34:34.934 --> 34:36.476
How the hell else
would he know?

34:36.476 --> 34:37.936
It's none of your damn
business how I knew.

34:37.937 --> 34:39.353
No, no, this is
between me and Harvey.

34:39.355 --> 34:41.106
Wrong, this is
between me and you

34:41.107 --> 34:42.774
because you broke your
agreement with my client.

34:42.775 --> 34:44.109
I don't care what I did.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.527
You didn't have
to do that publicly.

34:45.527 --> 34:47.235
I didn't make that decision.
You did.

34:47.237 --> 34:48.530
Bullshit, you could
have come to me privately.

34:48.531 --> 34:49.989
We could've had
a conversation.

34:49.991 --> 34:51.824
I did it when
this thing started,

34:51.826 --> 34:53.451
and I'm not doing it again.
- You son of a bitch.

34:53.452 --> 34:55.203
- He's right.
- What?

34:55.204 --> 34:57.288
Alex is right,
you gave him no choice.

34:57.289 --> 34:59.708
God damn it, Harvey, that
prison is doing shady shit.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.626
His client doesn't care because
all they care about is money.

35:01.627 --> 35:03.628
And you knew that
when you handed it off

35:03.629 --> 35:05.630
and said you'd live by it.
- This is about you

35:05.631 --> 35:07.757
coming into a courtroom and--
- Okay, that's it! It's done.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.926
I don't want to hear
another word about Reform Corp

35:09.927 --> 35:12.428
or Masterson Construction
ever again.

35:12.429 --> 35:14.681
You made your bed.
Now you're gonna sleep in it.

35:28.029 --> 35:30.113
Donna, you have a minute?

35:30.114 --> 35:32.490
Louis, if you're here
to berate me for what I said

35:32.491 --> 35:34.242
to Stephanie,
then, no, I don't.

35:34.243 --> 35:35.911
Uh, that is not
why I'm here.

35:35.912 --> 35:37.453
I came to tell you
that I'm sorry

35:37.454 --> 35:39.330
that I didn't listen
to you weeks ago.

35:39.331 --> 35:41.166
You're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.960
You kept telling me that
I wasn't dealing with Tara.

35:43.961 --> 35:46.546
Well, I finally started,
and I think because of that,

35:46.547 --> 35:48.715
it allowed me
to get past my anger

35:48.716 --> 35:51.760
and make peace
with Stephanie.

35:51.761 --> 35:54.512
I'm glad to hear it, Louis.
I'm proud of you.

35:54.513 --> 35:57.515
Like I said, I wish
I had listened to you sooner.

35:57.516 --> 35:59.350
But every bit of you
hammering away

35:59.351 --> 36:02.062
at my wall of denial is what
finally brought it down.

36:02.063 --> 36:06.692
So I'm here
to tell you thank you...

36:08.318 --> 36:09.986
Because now I feel like
I can finally

36:09.987 --> 36:11.529
move forward
with my life.

36:15.451 --> 36:17.244
You're welcome, Louis.

36:17.245 --> 36:20.914
And I think that this means
that you're officially ready.

36:20.915 --> 36:23.833
- Uh, for what?
- To take back the associates.

36:23.834 --> 36:26.086
Okay, Donna,
no, I appreciate that.

36:26.087 --> 36:28.046
But they're yours now.
- They were never mine, Louis.

36:28.047 --> 36:31.216
I was always just
taking care of them for you.

36:31.217 --> 36:33.969
I don't know
how I can repay you.

36:33.970 --> 36:35.804
You just did.

37:06.252 --> 37:08.253
Louis, if you're here
for the Stevenson brief,

37:08.254 --> 37:10.255
I can have it to you
in the morning.

37:10.256 --> 37:12.090
Go home, Brian.

37:12.091 --> 37:14.176
Am I fired?

37:14.177 --> 37:16.385
Nope, there's just more
to life than working here.

37:16.386 --> 37:18.013
Am I being punked?

37:18.014 --> 37:19.848
No, not at all.

37:19.849 --> 37:22.391
It's just that you have a new
supervisor starting tomorrow,

37:22.392 --> 37:23.768
and he would like you to get
a good night's sleep.

37:23.769 --> 37:25.478
And he told you
to tell me that?

37:25.479 --> 37:27.272
Oh, Jesus, Brian, please,
will you work with me?

37:27.273 --> 37:28.564
I'm the new supervisor.

37:28.565 --> 37:30.775
And listen,
I am sorry for saying

37:30.776 --> 37:33.361
all those horrible things
to you about undedicated.

37:33.362 --> 37:37.157
I can't even imagine how
you balance being a new dad

37:37.158 --> 37:40.869
with this workload.

37:40.870 --> 37:42.537
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

37:42.538 --> 37:45.290
See you tomorrow.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.459
Before you go, I got you
a little something.

37:57.386 --> 37:58.970
Louis, this is
the best onesie

37:58.971 --> 38:01.014
a man has ever gotten
another man.

38:01.015 --> 38:03.766
You just tell the little guy
to wear it well.

38:03.767 --> 38:06.353
And feel free to bring him in
whenever you want.

38:06.354 --> 38:08.688
But, you know, call first.

38:08.689 --> 38:11.191
This is a place of business,
for God's sake.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.210
What's that?

38:30.211 --> 38:33.129
Something I should have given
back to you a long time ago...

38:33.130 --> 38:34.589
the key to your apartment.

38:34.590 --> 38:36.258
I don't understand.

38:36.259 --> 38:39.969
I didn't know
about you and Paula, Harvey,

38:39.970 --> 38:41.930
and I kept it from you,

38:41.931 --> 38:44.515
and I don't want to keep it from
you because I'm happy for you.

38:44.516 --> 38:46.684
- Donna--
- I said I wanted more,

38:46.685 --> 38:48.478
and I got what I wanted.

38:49.939 --> 38:51.940
But when you told me
about the two of you,

38:51.941 --> 38:54.192
for a second there, I--
- I get it.

38:54.193 --> 38:55.985
- You do?
- I remember how it felt

38:55.986 --> 38:58.988
when I found out
about you and Stephen Huntley.

38:58.989 --> 39:02.325
And I told you before,
it bothered me.

39:02.326 --> 39:04.911
But it doesn't mean--

39:04.912 --> 39:06.454
Exactly.

39:12.044 --> 39:15.213
I really am happy for you,
Harvey.

39:15.214 --> 39:17.090

39:49.581 --> 39:53.209
- Yes, but it's only a setback.
- Setback?

39:53.210 --> 39:55.253
They said they threw out
the whole case.

39:55.254 --> 39:56.963
They didn't throw it out.
They just threw us off of it.

39:56.964 --> 39:58.547
What the hell's
the difference?

39:58.548 --> 40:00.091
The difference is
it's a good case,

40:00.092 --> 40:02.010
and somebody else
can still take it.

40:02.011 --> 40:03.761
We just have to--
- Stop bullshitting me!

40:03.762 --> 40:06.055
Now, you told me
to turn down that settlement.

40:06.056 --> 40:08.266
I trusted you,
and now it's over.

40:08.267 --> 40:09.976
No, it's not over,
and I know I told you

40:09.977 --> 40:12.437
to turn down that settlement,
but you told me

40:12.438 --> 40:14.272
you weren't doing this
for the money and--

40:14.273 --> 40:18.193
Yes, I know. I told you
I was doing it for justice.

40:18.194 --> 40:22.197
But I also told you I have
a son and two other daughters,

40:22.198 --> 40:24.615
and you convinced me
the only way to heal

40:24.616 --> 40:26.617
was to keep this from happening
to someone else,

40:26.618 --> 40:28.911
and now I have nothing.

40:28.912 --> 40:31.706
No money, no justice,
no healing.

40:33.876 --> 40:35.626
Oscar,
I'm gonna make it right.

40:35.627 --> 40:37.003
I'll believe that
when I see it!

Harvey, if this is
about earlier today,

40:46.514 --> 40:49.015
I want to thank you
for backing me.

40:49.016 --> 40:51.684
It is about
earlier today, Alex,

40:51.685 --> 40:54.354
but I'm not here
for you to thank me.

40:54.355 --> 40:56.064
What are you talking about?

40:56.065 --> 40:58.649
I got to thinking
about what Mike said,

40:58.650 --> 41:00.443
and he was right.

41:00.444 --> 41:03.363
You could've done what you
did quietly, but you didn't.

41:03.364 --> 41:05.031
Harvey--

41:05.032 --> 41:06.908
Which means this isn't
just about you protecting

41:06.909 --> 41:08.451
your client's interests.

41:08.452 --> 41:11.162
It's about you

41:11.163 --> 41:16.000
