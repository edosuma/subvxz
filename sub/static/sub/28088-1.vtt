01:52.245 --> 01:53.645
I've been at the bookie's

before we get to the Clansman. So as
not to annoy Boabby.

02:05.045 --> 02:06.924
Because his pies

02:21.604 --> 02:23.164
Well, how about

02:23.164 --> 02:24.724
Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep.

02:24.724 --> 02:26.164
You know what that is?

There you are. Listen, there's
a bunch of weans outside
asking for you.

03:51.044 --> 03:52.284

03:52.284 --> 03:55.884
Well, they just said, "Could you
please send out Mr Ingram?"

03:55.884 --> 03:58.324
What did you say?
I said, "Away hame and get
to your beds.

03:58.324 --> 04:00.164
"You've got school in the
morning, you wee fannies."

04:00.164 --> 04:03.044
Oddly, that didn't work,
so they're still there.

04:03.044 --> 04:05.004

A complete stranger
bestows a gift upon you

09:49.125 --> 09:51.884
in exchange for the privilege
of basking in your glow

09:51.884 --> 09:53.485
for the briefest of moments.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.205
What are you on about?

09:55.205 --> 09:56.365
Observe.

09:56.365 --> 10:00.924
Mate, can I trouble you
for a gratis hot dog sandwich?

10:00.924 --> 10:02.684
Absolutely not, junkie.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.044
There it is.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.405
Oh, aye.

10:09.404 --> 10:12.125
Aye, I see what you mean, son. Aye.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.725
Cheers.

10:16.245 --> 10:17.804
What's your next move?

10:17.804 --> 10:20.245
There's a young boy, works in
Henderson's the bakers,

10:20.245 --> 10:21.685
always on his phone.

10:21.684 --> 10:24.084
I think I'll get a sausage roll
out of him.

10:24.085 --> 10:27.325
Winston, if there's anything I know
about digital fame, it's fleeting.

10:27.325 --> 10:31.045
Do you think Elvis played hayrides
and hoedowns all his days?

10:31.044 --> 10:32.524
Naw.

10:32.524 --> 10:35.965
Mr Tom Parker took him to Vegas.

10:35.965 --> 10:38.725
And if you're enjoying
this amount of fame,

10:38.725 --> 10:42.004
and that mustard on your
cardigan tells me that you are,

10:42.004 --> 10:44.125
then you need to grow it.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.724
Nurture it.

10:45.725 --> 10:47.805
Keep it fresh.

10:47.804 --> 10:49.564
LAUGHS

10:49.565 --> 10:52.005
How would I do that?
Follow me.

11:00.684 --> 11:01.924
KLAXON-LIKE RINGTONE

11:01.924 --> 11:03.004
Ooh! Ya bastard.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.285
Jack Jarvis Esquire.

11:07.284 --> 11:10.684
To whom am I speaking?
It's your old pal Victor
McDade

11:10.684 --> 11:12.604
calling you from my mobile device.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.284
Oh, smashing.

11:14.284 --> 11:15.485
Are you in?

11:15.485 --> 11:16.725
Yes, I am.

11:16.725 --> 11:20.165
And the door is on the latch,
so enter at your leisure.

11:20.164 --> 11:23.004
Entering the apartment now, over.

11:24.845 --> 11:28.565
Ho-ho, I thoroughly enjoyed that!

11:28.565 --> 11:31.365
Aye. These are great, aren't they?

11:31.365 --> 11:33.605
But listen, I'm no' keen
on my phone when it rings.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.605
Oh, you mean your ringtone?

11:35.605 --> 11:37.325
Aye. I don't like it.

11:37.325 --> 11:39.605
It sounds like the Titanic
just before it sank.

11:39.605 --> 11:41.164
You can change that.

11:41.164 --> 11:43.164
Can you? What have you got?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.284
Call me.

11:47.605 --> 11:50.764
FUNKY MUSICAL RINGTONE

11:54.965 --> 11:56.165
I like that.

11:56.164 --> 12:00.764
Aye, aye, it's a good fit for me,
you know. Suggests a man of action.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.365
Mystery. Intrigue.

12:02.365 --> 12:04.245
Well, I'll have that as well, then.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.125
Aye. Naw.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.524
How not?

12:07.524 --> 12:09.443
Och, we cannae have the same
ringtone, Jack. That's shite.

12:09.445 --> 12:11.245
The ringtone's an individual thing.

12:11.245 --> 12:13.804
It should say something
unique about you!

12:13.804 --> 12:18.204
Well, I want mines to uniquely
say, "Hello, ladies.

12:18.205 --> 12:23.845
"I'm a widower, and therefore
available for dinner or
perhaps a little more."

12:23.845 --> 12:26.805
Do you know what the perfect
ringtone for that is, Jack?

12:26.804 --> 12:28.764
What?

12:28.764 --> 12:29.965
KLAXON-LIKE RINGTONE

12:29.965 --> 12:31.325
Oh, you bastard.

12:31.325 --> 12:33.085
Are yous in?

12:33.085 --> 12:36.965
Oh, yous need to come and see this!

12:38.404 --> 12:40.964
Oh. Oh, look, it's Winston.

12:40.965 --> 12:42.365
Hello, Winston!

12:42.365 --> 12:45.485
For God's sake, Jack,
it's no' a phone link,

12:45.485 --> 12:47.683
it's an uploaded video.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.923
It's an uploaded video, you daftie.

12:51.845 --> 12:54.365
MICK: What are you doing, Winston?

12:54.365 --> 12:55.965
The Winston combo roll.

12:55.965 --> 12:57.605
The breakfast of champions.

12:57.605 --> 12:59.685
MICK: That looks bogging.

12:59.684 --> 13:01.644
You live under a bridge!
That's bogging!

13:01.644 --> 13:03.365
Anyway, shut up and get in!

13:03.365 --> 13:05.845
It's me they're tuning in to see.

13:05.845 --> 13:09.045
Now, a lot of people
have been contacting me,

13:09.044 --> 13:11.604
tweeting me and FaceChatting me

13:11.605 --> 13:13.164
and certain things like that,

13:13.164 --> 13:15.324
to see how I keep my
strength up. And here it is.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.685
Come in, you eejit,
come in, closer to the pan.

13:17.684 --> 13:20.364
MICK: There's too much oil in there.

13:20.365 --> 13:23.365
What would you know about cooking?
Apart fae cooking wi' a spoon?

13:23.365 --> 13:25.284
BOTH LAUGH

13:25.284 --> 13:27.404
Right, back to the pan. Now,
here we go.

13:27.404 --> 13:30.605
You take your flat sausage
and you stick it there.

13:30.605 --> 13:31.764
Always flat, mind,

13:31.764 --> 13:33.924
because if you use links
they roll off the roll.

13:33.924 --> 13:37.245
So, you put your flat sausage
on the tattie-scone bed

13:37.245 --> 13:39.164
and then finally...

13:39.164 --> 13:41.964
..you top it with a fried egg.

13:41.965 --> 13:45.845
A wee bit o' white pepper and
the secret ingredient, Tabasco.

13:47.524 --> 13:50.444
That looks absolutely delicious.

13:50.445 --> 13:52.965
Right, here we go.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.644
MICK LAUGHS

13:55.644 --> 13:58.444
Shut it, you. Get me a towel.

13:58.445 --> 13:59.965
MICK LAUGHS

13:59.965 --> 14:01.685
Right. And what?

14:01.684 --> 14:04.444
Well, that's just Winston
doing what he normally does.

14:04.445 --> 14:06.285
I mean, who's interested in
watching that?

14:06.284 --> 14:09.004
Who's interested? Everybody.

14:10.245 --> 14:12.085
He only put that up this morning.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.925
That'll go up to a million, that.

14:14.924 --> 14:17.084
What's that there? Click that.

14:18.565 --> 14:19.925
There you go.

14:19.924 --> 14:21.524
MUSIC
Oh, dear.

14:21.524 --> 14:24.044
Oh, my God!
Get that off my computer!

14:24.044 --> 14:25.884
You'll have the polis at my door!

14:27.125 --> 14:28.284
Right, that one.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.684
Wait a minute.
Click it, click it!

14:30.684 --> 14:33.004
I can still see it!
What did you click?!

14:33.004 --> 14:34.085
"Like".

14:34.085 --> 14:36.405
Oh, my God.

14:37.965 --> 14:40.285
A million views.

14:40.284 --> 14:41.764
For bursting an egg?

14:41.764 --> 14:43.404
A million-and-a-half, and rising.

14:43.404 --> 14:47.204
That's your problem wi' the
modern world. You can get
famous for doing nothing.

14:47.205 --> 14:49.965
See, in the old days,
you had to have talent.

14:49.965 --> 14:51.805
You had to do everything.

14:51.804 --> 14:54.884
Your Forsyths, your Basseys,

14:54.884 --> 14:56.564
your Pasquales.

14:56.565 --> 14:59.125
He just had the daft voice.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.884
That's more than Winston's got.

15:00.884 --> 15:02.524
Aye, well, anyroads...

15:02.524 --> 15:05.764
We want some of that
and we're going to do it better.

15:05.764 --> 15:09.284
What are you two daft old buggers
gonnae dae wi' phones?

15:09.284 --> 15:10.924
Call each other a hearse?

15:12.284 --> 15:14.125
How many contacts do you have?

15:14.125 --> 15:15.485
Eh...

15:15.485 --> 15:17.324
Let me see noo.

15:17.325 --> 15:18.525
Code.

15:18.524 --> 15:22.884
Contacts. Contacts, contacts.

15:22.884 --> 15:24.325
One.

15:25.845 --> 15:28.245
Let me guess. Jack?

15:28.245 --> 15:29.965
Aye.

15:29.965 --> 15:33.285
And would your secret
passcode be 1234?

15:34.725 --> 15:36.004
Naw.

15:36.004 --> 15:38.365
FUNKY MUSICAL RINGTONE

15:38.365 --> 15:39.565
Excuse me.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.325
Oh, who could it be?

15:41.325 --> 15:43.725
Hello, Jack. How are you, my friend?

15:43.725 --> 15:45.245
Good.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.685
Are you, aye? Good for you.

15:48.684 --> 15:49.884
What are you wanting?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.524
Pint of lager for Jack, please,
Boabby.

15:56.804 --> 15:58.284
These are bloody brilliant.

15:58.284 --> 16:00.644
You can still talk even when
you're doing a pish!

16:00.644 --> 16:03.524
Here, Jack, how many contacts
do you have?

16:03.524 --> 16:05.044
Oh, right. Eh...

16:05.044 --> 16:06.164

16:06.164 --> 16:08.125
Eh...eh...one.

16:08.125 --> 16:11.404
Aye, you should have went to Toys R
Us and got yourselves

16:11.404 --> 16:14.845
a pair of weans' walkie-talkies, you
couple of wallopers.

16:14.845 --> 16:17.764
Boys, are yous wanting to add me

16:17.764 --> 16:20.284

BOTH: Sure!

16:20.284 --> 16:22.964
Are yous wanting my contact
details, boys?

16:22.965 --> 16:24.445
BOTH: Naw.

16:24.445 --> 16:28.685
Right, I've sent my number
to both of your numbers.

16:28.684 --> 16:30.844
PHONES CHIME

16:30.845 --> 16:32.325
How do you know our numbers?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.405
How did I know your numbers?

16:35.404 --> 16:36.564
ISA CHUCKLES

16:36.565 --> 16:37.725
See? There you are, Boabby.

16:37.725 --> 16:39.284
We'll build up our contacts,

16:39.284 --> 16:41.605
especially when we go virile.

16:41.605 --> 16:43.085
Viral, Jack.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.004
What did I say?
Virile.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.524
Aye, you've not got
whatever Winston's got.

16:48.524 --> 16:51.884
Shut your hole. We've got it in
spades. How hard can it be?

16:51.884 --> 16:54.605
My favourite one of them
is when the wee boy bites the other

16:54.605 --> 16:56.365
- wee boy's finger.
- Aye.

16:56.365 --> 16:59.044
Oh, no, no, I like the newsreader
boy

16:59.044 --> 17:02.164
when his family all burst in
behind him.

17:02.164 --> 17:04.204
This is my favourite.

17:04.204 --> 17:05.804
Cliff diver.

17:05.805 --> 17:07.924
Misses the water completely.

17:07.924 --> 17:09.044
CRUNCH

17:09.045 --> 17:10.565
BOTH: Ohh!

17:10.565 --> 17:14.565
Oh, ye sick bastard!
Why would you watch that?

17:14.565 --> 17:15.964
Cos it's funny.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.605
Look at him.

17:17.605 --> 17:18.924
He's just mush!

17:18.924 --> 17:21.125
Eight million views!

17:21.125 --> 17:23.684
Right, that's what we'll do, then.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.763
I'll get Victor to film me stepping
out in front of an 89 bus

17:26.765 --> 17:27.964
and getting splattered.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.924
I mean, who would watch that?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.204
Me, eight million times.

17:35.204 --> 17:38.484
Here he is! Scotland's Angry
Grandpa!

17:38.484 --> 17:40.964
Aye, that's what they're
calling you!

17:40.964 --> 17:43.284
Aye, that's ma gimmick, boys.

17:43.285 --> 17:44.485
BOABBY: Goldie?

17:44.484 --> 17:46.524
Certainly not.

17:46.525 --> 17:47.725
Mineral water.

17:49.085 --> 17:50.485
Got to watch the weight.

17:50.484 --> 17:53.444
- Camera adds 20lb.
- Mineral water, eh?

17:53.444 --> 17:56.004
Listen to this one.
He's went all Hollywood!

17:56.005 --> 17:58.245
You'll be forgetting your pals next.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.684
Eh...

17:59.684 --> 18:03.044
- Tam, isn't it?
- "Isn't it"?!

18:03.045 --> 18:06.005
I'm only winding you up.
It's good to see ye.

18:06.005 --> 18:07.445
Aye.

18:07.444 --> 18:09.044
WINSTON CHUCKLES

18:09.045 --> 18:10.164
- W-W-What's this?
- Eh?

18:10.164 --> 18:11.365
I've no' got malaria.

18:11.365 --> 18:12.924
Oh, I know, I know,

18:12.924 --> 18:15.365
but the thing is, you see, I've been
shaking that many paws,

18:15.365 --> 18:17.684
you know, you've got to be safe.

18:17.684 --> 18:20.244
I mean, you just don't know what's
out there.

18:20.244 --> 18:22.684
I'll tell you this,
you think you're a big shot.

18:22.684 --> 18:27.244
- There's no money in it.
- Is there no'?

18:27.244 --> 18:31.004
Opened that new bingo hall on Carson
Street this morning.

18:31.005 --> 18:32.805
500 quid.

18:32.805 --> 18:34.445
Cash in hand.

18:36.884 --> 18:38.684
Let's face it, boys.

18:38.684 --> 18:42.365
You're analogue...and I'm digital.

18:42.365 --> 18:44.605
Winston.
What?

18:44.605 --> 18:46.325
Can we add you as a contact?

18:46.325 --> 18:49.684
Shut it, tadgers!

18:58.484 --> 19:00.684
How do we even get this up
onto the World Wide Web?

19:00.684 --> 19:02.004
It's called top-loading.

19:02.005 --> 19:05.445
We don't need to worry about
that. Isa's going to help us

19:05.444 --> 19:08.845
by top-loading it into the
clouds, or something.

19:08.845 --> 19:10.845
Are we...we ready?

19:10.845 --> 19:13.444
Ready, let's do this.

19:16.444 --> 19:18.125
What are you doing, old pal?

19:18.125 --> 19:19.605
Just feeding the ducks.

19:19.605 --> 19:21.204
Hey, hey, classic.

19:21.204 --> 19:22.324
Sick.

19:27.684 --> 19:31.125
Oh, there's the wind blew my
bunnet off.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.845
That's embarrassing. I hope you
weren't filming that.

19:33.845 --> 19:36.164
BOTH LAUGH

19:36.164 --> 19:37.805
Right, we're done.

19:37.805 --> 19:39.805
CHUCKLES

19:39.805 --> 19:42.325
Gold.
Oh, aye.

19:43.565 --> 19:44.725
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:44.724 --> 19:48.244
TV: ..Race today we've got eight
runners and it's the 17.45.

19:48.244 --> 19:50.164
KNOCKING CONTINUES

19:56.484 --> 19:57.684
This better be good.

19:57.684 --> 19:58.844
We need to make a new video.

SIGHS

20:09.325 --> 20:10.525
Don't do a PSY.

20:10.525 --> 20:12.365
I'm sighing because I need to watch
my race.

20:12.365 --> 20:13.724
There's a special horse in it.

20:13.724 --> 20:16.404
Naw. Don't do a PSY -

20:16.404 --> 20:19.524
the South Korean overnight
sensation.

20:19.525 --> 20:21.325
See if I knew
what you were talking about,

20:21.325 --> 20:22.845
I'd be interested, but I'm no'.

20:24.045 --> 20:25.125
See PSY?

20:25.125 --> 20:26.365
See PSY?

20:26.365 --> 20:28.605
Aye, see PSY?

20:28.605 --> 20:30.365
See PSY, see PSY by the seashore.

20:30.365 --> 20:32.444
Why are you still on my doorstep?

20:32.444 --> 20:34.924
PSY had it all. Mad wee dance.

20:34.924 --> 20:36.325
Gangnam Style.

20:36.325 --> 20:37.525
Wee lasso.

20:37.525 --> 20:39.245
The whole world loved it.

20:39.244 --> 20:43.284
PSY's big boss is like that.
"What's next?"

20:43.285 --> 20:44.404
PSY's like that...

20:46.924 --> 20:49.164
"..Is this no' enough?"

20:49.164 --> 20:51.244
PSY's boss is like that. "Naw."

20:51.244 --> 20:54.884
PSY's like that. Raging.

20:54.884 --> 20:57.244
Next thing you know,
he's...he's binned.

20:57.244 --> 20:59.844
Like a pumpkin on November 1st!

20:59.845 --> 21:01.045
LAUGHS

21:01.045 --> 21:03.525
Right. I caught PSY and something
about a pumpkin.

21:03.525 --> 21:05.965
Now, my horse is running,
and I need to see it!

21:05.964 --> 21:08.845
What I'm saying is,
don't be a cautionary tale.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.245
A one-hit wonder.

21:10.244 --> 21:12.404
You'll need to come up with
something better than,

21:12.404 --> 21:13.964
"Shut it, tadger."

21:13.964 --> 21:16.404
TV: ..and it's Shut It, Tadger

21:16.404 --> 21:19.524

Dumbarton in third.

21:19.525 --> 21:21.644
I had a tenner on my Tadger.

21:24.964 --> 21:26.244
ISA: It's a hit.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.524
Oh, yes, eh?

21:27.525 --> 21:29.125
We're a hit!

21:29.125 --> 21:30.565
Naw. You've got one hit.

21:30.565 --> 21:33.605
And that was me checking I've
uploaded it properly.

21:33.605 --> 21:35.245
Oh, well, we're humped.

21:35.244 --> 21:36.884
Hold on, Jack.

21:36.884 --> 21:40.125
If you throw one dart and miss the
board, what does that tell you?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.765
Well, it means that you're
shite at darts.

21:41.765 --> 21:44.085
Naw! You throw another.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.444
Then another.

21:45.444 --> 21:48.444
Then another one after that. And you
keep throwing them until...

21:48.444 --> 21:51.284
You have to take the dartboard down
and re-paper the wall

21:51.285 --> 21:53.165
cos it's full o' wee holes.
