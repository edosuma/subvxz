00:35.090 --> 00:37.357
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.125
And through that,

00:38.127 --> 00:39.759
the inhuman spirit
tricked you.

00:39.761 --> 00:42.496
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

00:42.498 --> 00:44.798
What's an inhuman spirit?

00:44.800 --> 00:45.866
It's something
that's never

00:45.868 --> 00:48.668
walked the earth
in human form.

00:48.670 --> 00:50.170
It's something demonic.

00:50.172 --> 00:53.573
So,
the doll was never possessed?

00:53.575 --> 00:56.477
No,
it was used as a conduit.

00:56.479 --> 00:59.346
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

00:59.348 --> 01:02.149
Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

01:02.151 --> 01:04.218
They possess people.

01:04.220 --> 01:06.620
It wanted to
get inside of you.

01:06.622 --> 01:09.723
And given
this unusual feature,

01:09.725 --> 01:12.325
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

01:12.327 --> 01:13.727
- Cared for?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13.729 --> 01:15.398
It should be destroyed.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.801
That would
only make things worse.

01:20.803 --> 01:23.239
We think it best
the doll come with us.

01:24.672 --> 01:26.873
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

01:26.875 --> 01:29.376
That sounds like
a great idea.

01:29.378 --> 01:30.712
She's all yours.

How much longer,
do you think?

01:55.804 --> 01:57.470
Eh, about an hour.

01:57.472 --> 01:59.373
Why don't you put your
head back? Get some rest.

01:59.375 --> 02:02.542
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.

02:02.544 --> 02:06.245
If I do that,
we might end up in California.

02:06.247 --> 02:08.447
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.

02:08.449 --> 02:10.517
Nothing wrong with that.

02:10.519 --> 02:12.319
I'll pick up Judy
on the way.

02:12.321 --> 02:14.787
Ah, that actually sounds
so nice, Ed.

02:14.789 --> 02:16.425
We should plan on it.

02:16.824 --> 02:17.827
Uh-oh.

02:19.394 --> 02:20.729
What's this?

02:30.739 --> 02:33.810
You folks need to turn around.
Pretty bad accident up ahead.

02:34.743 --> 02:36.843
Uh, anything we can do?

02:36.845 --> 02:38.712
You a doctor or something?

02:38.714 --> 02:40.250
Or something.

02:43.452 --> 02:45.618
He just meant if you need
an extra set of hands.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.886
Yeah.

02:46.888 --> 02:48.690
We got it covered. Thanks.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.632
Nice doll.

02:56.398 --> 02:57.633
That's what you think.

02:59.968 --> 03:02.803
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.

03:02.805 --> 03:06.005
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.

03:06.007 --> 03:07.874
- 26. Got it.
- Thank you, Officer.

03:11.013 --> 03:12.949
A guy and his doll.

03:29.597 --> 03:31.530
I think we missed our turn.

03:31.532 --> 03:34.034
We didn't miss it.
Bridgewater's just up ahead.

03:34.036 --> 03:35.868
Bridgewater?
Old Ridge Road.

03:35.870 --> 03:37.339
Where did you get
Bridgewater from?

03:39.307 --> 03:41.578
Well, you know what?
I think we missed our turn.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.279
I'll keep my eye out
for the Pacific.

03:48.684 --> 03:49.686
Ed?

03:51.519 --> 03:53.488
- Ed?
- Hang on, hang on.

04:02.998 --> 04:05.235
- Come on.
- What just happened?

04:06.301 --> 04:08.837
Uh... I'll pop the hood
and find out.

04:13.475 --> 04:14.876
Well, be careful.

04:28.823 --> 04:29.925
There we go.

05:47.835 --> 05:49.569
I like your doll.

06:11.492 --> 06:13.462
I feel cold.

06:27.141 --> 06:29.011
You were
just in an accident.

06:31.712 --> 06:32.881
I was?

06:35.717 --> 06:37.954
Sorry. Wires crossed.

06:54.703 --> 06:55.871
That should do it.

06:58.739 --> 07:00.442
Honey, you okay?

07:12.220 --> 07:13.588
Ed!

07:17.092 --> 07:18.094
I'm okay.

07:20.128 --> 07:21.326
I'm so sorry!

07:21.328 --> 07:23.562
All of a sudden it was like
somebody took over my truck.

07:23.564 --> 07:25.698
I had no control.
Are you okay?

07:25.700 --> 07:26.736
I'm fine.

07:30.905 --> 07:32.441
It's the doll, Ed.

07:34.109 --> 07:36.179
It's a beacon
for other spirits.

09:08.170 --> 09:09.539
Over here.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.061
Father, sooner the better.
Yeah?

09:33.394 --> 09:34.596
Yeah.

09:46.742 --> 09:50.010
Be not wise
in thine own eyes.

09:50.012 --> 09:53.313
Fear the Lord
and depart from evil.

09:55.017 --> 09:59.685
The curse of the Lord is
in the house of the wicked.

09:59.687 --> 10:03.792
But He blesseth
the habitation of the just.

10:04.893 --> 10:07.894
Surely,
He scorneth the scorners,

10:07.896 --> 10:12.131
but He giveth grace
unto the lowly.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.367
The wise shall inherit
the glory,

10:15.369 --> 10:19.609
but shame shall be
the promotion of fools.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.681
Amen.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.234
We need another
barrier of protection.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.235
A holy one.

10:48.704 --> 10:49.839
I agree.

10:50.906 --> 10:53.175
The blessing
will only do so much.

10:57.111 --> 10:58.178
That chapel glass

10:58.180 --> 11:01.113
we got from Trinity Church
before it was torn down,

11:01.115 --> 11:02.183
where is that?

11:23.138 --> 11:24.337
"Let us forgive those

11:24.339 --> 11:25.939
who trespass against us

11:25.941 --> 11:27.942
and lead us
not into temptation,

11:28.974 --> 11:29.210
but deliver us from evil."

11:29.978 --> 11:30.979
Amen.

11:42.858 --> 11:44.426
Did it work?

11:50.931 --> 11:53.201
Hmm. The evil is contained.

You're my hero.

14:06.935 --> 14:08.133
The pizza money
is on the counter

14:08.135 --> 14:09.434
and numbers are by the phone.

14:09.436 --> 14:10.469
Perfect.

14:10.471 --> 14:11.603
And we'll be back
early tomorrow morning.

14:11.605 --> 14:15.040
Well, and take your time,
we'll be fine. Right, Judy?

14:15.042 --> 14:16.976
Yeah.

14:16.978 --> 14:19.045
- So, you'll...
- Behave? Yes.

14:19.047 --> 14:20.146
And you'll remember
to go to...

14:20.148 --> 14:21.280
Remember to go to bed
on time.

14:21.282 --> 14:22.982
Absolutely.

14:22.984 --> 14:24.549
- All right, don't forget to...
- To have fun.

14:24.551 --> 14:25.587
- I know.
- That, too.

14:27.955 --> 14:30.256
Did you guys rehearse that,
or what?

14:43.370 --> 14:45.106
Earth to Judy!

14:47.242 --> 14:48.244
What's wrong?

14:48.643 --> 14:50.008
Nothing.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.112
I'm fine.

14:52.647 --> 14:54.948
Well, it's just a couple more
hours until the weekend.

14:54.950 --> 14:56.049
I'm gonna run to the market

14:56.051 --> 14:57.116
for supplies
during my free period.

14:57.118 --> 14:58.119
I'll pick you up after, okay?

15:00.522 --> 15:02.090
Sounds super.

15:07.228 --> 15:08.297
Bye, Judy!

15:11.199 --> 15:12.468
Have a good day!

16:12.527 --> 16:14.293
Mrs. Faley,
it's right over here.

16:14.295 --> 16:15.297
Let me show you.

16:18.032 --> 16:19.098
How could you not tell me

16:19.100 --> 16:20.266
what the Warrens did
for a living?

16:20.268 --> 16:21.767
Shouldn't you be
in math class?

16:21.769 --> 16:23.368
Mary Ellen!

16:23.370 --> 16:25.371
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

16:25.373 --> 16:26.572
and never told you
what they did.

16:26.574 --> 16:28.141
Oh, what do they do?

16:28.143 --> 16:29.541
They're podiatrists.

16:29.543 --> 16:31.209
So not the same.

16:31.211 --> 16:33.212
Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

16:33.214 --> 16:34.679
We do have
that social studies project

16:34.681 --> 16:36.348
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

16:36.350 --> 16:37.784
We don't have any project.

16:37.786 --> 16:39.220
Okay, but how would
they know?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.120
She's psychic.

16:41.122 --> 16:43.256
Then, they're heroes.

16:43.258 --> 16:44.823
I think
they're concerned parents

16:44.825 --> 16:46.324
who wouldn't want
negative influences

16:46.326 --> 16:47.459
around their child.

16:47.461 --> 16:49.127
What negative influence?

16:49.129 --> 16:51.063
'Cause I sometimes
stay out past curfew?

16:51.065 --> 16:53.265
Among other things.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.767
So, what's it like
inside the house?

16:54.769 --> 16:57.235
Is it all creepy music
and cobwebs?

16:57.237 --> 16:58.805
No. No, it's boring suburbia.

16:58.807 --> 17:00.476
The inside
of your locker is scarier.

17:03.211 --> 17:06.646
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?

17:06.647 --> 17:07.813
Judy's birthday is coming up,

17:07.815 --> 17:09.682
so we're gonna
celebrate early.

17:09.684 --> 17:12.550
You really are the best
babysitter, you know that?

17:12.553 --> 17:14.654
Compliments will
get you nowhere.

17:14.656 --> 17:15.820
What about threats?

17:15.823 --> 17:19.125
Did you, uh, happen to notice
who's working checkout?

17:19.127 --> 17:21.094
- Have a good one.
- Will do.

17:21.096 --> 17:22.493
- Thank you so much.
- See you soon.

17:22.496 --> 17:23.627
You wouldn't.

17:23.630 --> 17:25.231
You know what they call him,
right?

17:25.233 --> 17:27.136
- Have a good one.
- What?

17:31.872 --> 17:33.473
Bob's-Got-Balls.

17:33.475 --> 17:34.607
How you doing?

17:34.609 --> 17:35.711
Hi, Daniela.

17:42.817 --> 17:44.649
Uh...

17:44.651 --> 17:48.120
- Hi, Mary Ellen.
- Is this everything?

17:48.122 --> 17:50.289
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.523
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

17:51.525 --> 17:52.559
Uh...

17:52.561 --> 17:55.627
Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting
for them tonight.

17:55.629 --> 17:58.164
Yeah. Yeah, I live
right across the street.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.500
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?

18:00.502 --> 18:02.335
Like a ghost, maybe?

18:02.337 --> 18:03.569
Bob...

18:03.571 --> 18:04.604
Mrs. Faley went ahead

18:04.606 --> 18:07.139
and dropped a can
of tomato sauce in aisle five,

18:07.141 --> 18:10.276
and it looks like a crime
scene, so get the mop.

18:10.278 --> 18:11.543
Ladies. Did you find
everything okay?

18:11.545 --> 18:12.578
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.680
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?

18:14.682 --> 18:15.647
- No.
- No.

18:15.649 --> 18:16.915
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.717
I'll do it right after.

18:18.719 --> 18:20.121
So, what'd you see?

18:21.222 --> 18:23.289
At the Warrens'?

18:23.291 --> 18:24.857
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

18:24.859 --> 18:27.460
Um, your total is $3.50, so...

18:27.462 --> 18:28.464
Oh.

18:29.496 --> 18:31.597
But you knew
what the Warrens did?

18:31.599 --> 18:34.200
There were rumors,
I guess, but...

18:34.202 --> 18:35.800
Rumors. Interesting.

18:35.802 --> 18:38.671
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?

18:38.673 --> 18:40.940
- Wait, really?
- What is it about?

18:40.942 --> 18:42.508
Uh, it's about a girl
who has a...

18:42.510 --> 18:44.446
Fine. You can come.
Stop.

18:46.246 --> 18:48.246
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

18:48.248 --> 18:50.515
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.

18:50.517 --> 18:52.652
Um... So, what...

18:52.654 --> 18:53.886
Bye, Bob. Thanks.

18:53.888 --> 18:54.889
Bye.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.793
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...

18:59.526 --> 19:00.893
Here.

19:00.895 --> 19:02.397
She likes you.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.903
There's been an accident.

19:19.414 --> 19:20.549
Don't touch her.

19:21.515 --> 19:22.882
You'll get obsessed.

19:22.884 --> 19:24.817
- It's "possessed."
- That's what I said.

19:24.819 --> 19:27.286
Anyways, if you know so much,

19:27.288 --> 19:28.154
why don't you tell us

19:28.156 --> 19:29.825
if you can catch cooties
from a ghost?

19:30.457 --> 19:31.691
You can't.

19:31.693 --> 19:33.392
Well, then how'd you get 'em?

19:33.394 --> 19:34.926
Anthony Rios!

19:34.928 --> 19:36.564
Don't make me
get your sister.

19:37.398 --> 19:38.463
Please don't.

19:38.465 --> 19:40.966
Then go. All of you.
Come on.

19:40.968 --> 19:43.402
Come on. Let's go!

19:43.404 --> 19:45.574
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.

19:47.274 --> 19:48.808
You can't either?

19:48.810 --> 19:50.475
My parents said
I'm not really prepared

19:50.477 --> 19:51.746
to process death yet.

19:53.747 --> 19:55.447
It's a birthday party.

19:55.449 --> 19:56.484
I'm sorry.

20:09.464 --> 20:11.664
Hey, how long
has that been happening?

20:11.666 --> 20:13.769
Since everyone heard about
the article this week.

20:14.901 --> 20:16.335
Please don't tell my parents.

20:16.337 --> 20:18.937
I won't.
I won't as long as you do.

20:18.939 --> 20:20.940
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.

20:20.942 --> 20:22.008
They're worried
about everything

20:22.010 --> 20:23.512
whether they need to be
or not.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.283
Are you sure the bullying is

20:31.285 --> 20:32.917
the only thing
that's bothering you?

20:32.919 --> 20:34.419
That isn't bothering me.

20:34.421 --> 20:35.723
You know what I mean.

20:41.495 --> 20:43.898
And remember our deal.
No secrets.

20:44.599 --> 20:46.299
I know.

20:46.301 --> 20:47.502
I don't have any.

20:49.003 --> 20:50.672
What did you get
at the store?

20:51.406 --> 20:52.771
A surprise.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.674
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

20:55.676 --> 20:58.847
- What is it then?
- It's a surprise.

21:01.448 --> 21:06.751
<i>♪ I remember
Finding out about you ♪</i>

21:14.861 --> 21:16.631
You're gonna make a mess.

21:21.502 --> 21:23.001
Hey! Save some for the cake.

21:23.003 --> 21:24.406
No.

21:31.111 --> 21:33.514
I think
there's someone at the door.

21:46.426 --> 21:49.361
I was knocking on the door
for, like, ten minutes.

21:49.363 --> 21:51.496
How did you even get in?

21:51.498 --> 21:53.699
Back door.
Is this a spirit bell?

21:53.701 --> 21:55.367
What's a spirit bell?

21:55.369 --> 21:57.802
It tells you if you're in
the presence of any spirits.

21:57.804 --> 21:59.605
- So, it is one.
- No.

21:59.607 --> 22:02.007
It's just a bell.
My mom collects them.

22:02.009 --> 22:03.545
Oh.

22:04.044 --> 22:05.543
Who are you?

22:05.545 --> 22:08.614
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.

22:08.616 --> 22:09.949
Oh, good!

22:09.951 --> 22:11.086
I love cake.

22:12.486 --> 22:14.552
So, Judy.

22:14.554 --> 22:18.626
Don't your parents, like, keep
any creepy stuff around?

22:20.528 --> 22:21.894
No.

22:21.896 --> 22:24.332
They keep it all locked away
in a room.

22:26.833 --> 22:28.800
Well, can we at least
go in and look?

22:28.802 --> 22:29.937
No!

22:31.571 --> 22:33.875
It's not really good
for anyone to go in there.

22:34.708 --> 22:35.710
How come?

22:36.711 --> 22:38.080
Just isn't.

22:39.647 --> 22:40.648
Wait.

22:42.015 --> 22:43.549
Here.

22:43.551 --> 22:44.552
Birthday present.

22:48.488 --> 22:49.722
What is it?

22:49.724 --> 22:50.891
Look inside.

22:58.064 --> 22:59.665
How did you
even afford those?

22:59.667 --> 23:00.799
They're my old ones.

23:00.801 --> 23:02.667
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

23:02.669 --> 23:04.669
the first time I put them on.

23:04.671 --> 23:05.805
You're kidding.

23:05.807 --> 23:08.706
She looks
way more coordinated.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.142
They're gonna ruin the floors.

23:10.144 --> 23:12.478
Can we go around
the block, then?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.180
- I don't think...
- Good idea.

23:14.182 --> 23:15.280
You guys go.

23:15.282 --> 23:17.386
I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

23:18.886 --> 23:21.587
Fine. But don't snoop.
Don't touch.

23:21.589 --> 23:23.521
Don't do anything. Please?

23:23.523 --> 23:25.494
Stay in the kitchen.
Promise me.

23:25.993 --> 23:27.162
I promise.

24:07.568 --> 24:08.901
Fuck it.

24:08.903 --> 24:11.740
I am calling out to the
spirits on the other side.

24:12.807 --> 24:14.976
Please unlock this door
and let me in.

24:29.623 --> 24:30.791
Shit.

25:56.209 --> 25:57.711
Please don't judge me.

26:01.648 --> 26:02.716
Amen.

26:21.869 --> 26:23.071
Whoa.

26:33.813 --> 26:34.815
Whoa.

27:52.926 --> 27:54.995
What'd you do
to get in there?

29:57.484 --> 30:00.021
If there is a presence here
in this room,

30:01.120 --> 30:02.924
please give me a sign.

30:07.927 --> 30:09.129
Any sign at all.

30:14.901 --> 30:15.969
Dad?

30:28.882 --> 30:29.883
This is stupid.

32:11.551 --> 32:12.552
Shit.

32:46.285 --> 32:48.220
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

32:48.222 --> 32:49.754
Only the top.

32:49.756 --> 32:52.089
Just put frosting on it.

32:52.091 --> 32:53.558
She'll never know.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.592
How'd it go with the skates?

32:54.594 --> 32:56.228
She loved them until she fell
on the way back

32:56.230 --> 32:57.695
and skinned her knee.

32:57.697 --> 32:59.263
Better than breaking her arm.

32:59.265 --> 33:00.464
Where is she anyway?

33:00.466 --> 33:02.634
She's out
feeding the chickens.

33:02.636 --> 33:04.469
They have chickens?

33:08.408 --> 33:09.676
Hey. How's your knee?

33:10.276 --> 33:11.443
Oh.

33:11.445 --> 33:14.613
Looks like your jeans will
at least need some stitches.

33:14.615 --> 33:15.746
It's okay.

33:15.748 --> 33:17.184
Accidents happen.

33:21.754 --> 33:23.224
So, are you scared yet?

33:24.291 --> 33:26.258
Scared? What? No.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.059
Who says they're scared?

33:28.061 --> 33:30.127
Kids in my class.

33:30.129 --> 33:31.829
Anthony Rios started it.

33:31.831 --> 33:33.165
I hate him.

33:33.167 --> 33:35.570
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

33:36.369 --> 33:38.039
Do you know him?

33:38.571 --> 33:41.373
Yeah, he's my brother.

33:41.375 --> 33:44.475
Anthony Rios is your brother?

33:44.477 --> 33:46.744
Yeah, I know.
Don't hold it against me.

33:46.746 --> 33:49.213
I don't like him either.

33:49.215 --> 33:51.119
You know,
he still wets the bed.

33:51.784 --> 33:53.585
You didn't hear it from me.

33:53.587 --> 33:55.289
Or maybe you did,
I don't care.

33:55.855 --> 33:57.521
Still, just...

33:57.523 --> 33:59.226
go a little easy on him.

33:59.860 --> 34:02.230
It's been a tough year.

34:05.398 --> 34:08.101
You lost somebody,
didn't you?

34:09.770 --> 34:11.371
My dad. Uh...

34:12.172 --> 34:14.108
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

34:15.409 --> 34:16.511
No.

34:17.377 --> 34:18.612
I just knew.

34:20.746 --> 34:22.880
Um, for delivery.

34:22.882 --> 34:25.717
Could I do one large, please?

34:25.719 --> 34:29.190
Um, it's gonna be
3506 Wayman Street.

34:30.357 --> 34:32.092
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

34:36.263 --> 34:37.895
Coming.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.835
Hold your horses.

34:51.377 --> 34:52.612
Who is it?

34:58.451 --> 34:59.786
Hello?

35:01.455 --> 35:02.790
Daniela?

35:11.397 --> 35:12.833
Is Annabelle there?

35:20.674 --> 35:22.373
Who?

35:22.375 --> 35:24.511
Can Annabelle
come out to play?

35:38.625 --> 35:39.858
I think you have
the wrong house.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.562
There's no Annabelle here.

35:44.230 --> 35:45.797
Yes, she is.

35:45.799 --> 35:47.835
She's right behind you.

35:58.779 --> 36:01.645
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

36:01.647 --> 36:03.915
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

36:03.917 --> 36:05.817
It scares them.

36:05.819 --> 36:08.286
They treat it like it's some
disease they don't wanna get,

36:08.288 --> 36:10.157
even though
everyone already has it.

36:11.225 --> 36:13.224
But here's the thing.

36:13.226 --> 36:14.893
I used to think
it was fatal and whammo.

36:14.895 --> 36:16.228
It's, like, out.

36:16.230 --> 36:18.395
Like turning off a TV.

36:18.397 --> 36:19.697
Then I learned
about your parents

36:19.699 --> 36:20.799
and their whole exploration

36:20.801 --> 36:22.569
into the afterlife
and stuff...

36:24.837 --> 36:26.373
and they gave me hope.

36:27.873 --> 36:30.877
That maybe
life goes on somehow.

36:32.612 --> 36:33.614
Maybe...

36:34.614 --> 36:38.386
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

36:39.386 --> 36:40.819
"Darling dad"?

36:40.821 --> 36:42.621
It was a thing.

36:42.623 --> 36:45.626
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

36:46.726 --> 36:47.795
Stupid.

36:49.462 --> 36:51.231
He's still out there,
you know.

36:52.398 --> 36:53.998
You think so?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.936
My parents
would say he is, too.

37:16.623 --> 37:18.322
Where are you going?

37:18.324 --> 37:19.694
Be right back.

37:31.804 --> 37:32.973
Dad?

37:50.089 --> 37:51.458
Daniela?

38:01.067 --> 38:03.000
Daniela!

38:03.002 --> 38:06.003
Where did she go?

38:06.005 --> 38:07.005
What are you doing?

38:07.007 --> 38:09.510
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

38:11.645 --> 38:14.014
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

38:17.016 --> 38:18.285
What did you see?

38:21.621 --> 38:23.420
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

40:55.174 --> 40:56.176
Judy?

41:05.118 --> 41:06.119
Judy?

41:11.090 --> 41:12.092
Judy?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.634
Judy?

41:25.871 --> 41:27.672
In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

41:27.674 --> 41:29.273
Let me never be
put to confusion.

41:29.275 --> 41:31.074
Deliver me into
Thy righteousness

41:31.076 --> 41:32.744
and cause me to escape.
Incline Thine ear...

41:32.746 --> 41:34.612
Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

41:34.614 --> 41:36.050
What's going on? What's wrong?

41:38.018 --> 41:39.552
What's going on?

41:42.989 --> 41:44.191
What happened?

41:45.324 --> 41:46.493
Nothing.

41:46.826 --> 41:47.962
Judy...

41:50.263 --> 41:52.063
I just got scared.

41:52.065 --> 41:53.967
Scared of what?

41:57.804 --> 41:59.106
Sometimes...

42:00.105 --> 42:01.806
I see things.

42:01.808 --> 42:03.811
Like how my mom sees things.

42:08.081 --> 42:10.551
You mean like ghosts?

42:15.355 --> 42:17.157
Where do you see them?

42:19.125 --> 42:20.761
Everywhere I go.

42:27.100 --> 42:28.168
Judy...

42:29.868 --> 42:32.203
Ghosts used to be people.

42:32.205 --> 42:34.842
And not every person
you meet is bad...

42:36.342 --> 42:39.679
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

42:49.889 --> 42:50.891
Daniela.

42:52.025 --> 42:53.958
- You have to see this.
- What?

42:53.960 --> 42:56.194
It's this case the Warrens
investigated about this girl

42:56.196 --> 42:58.262
who was terrorized by
something called the Ferryman.

42:58.264 --> 43:00.098
Here's a picture
of the girl he killed.

43:00.100 --> 43:01.366
Look familiar?

43:01.368 --> 43:03.203
I mean,
you two could be sisters.

43:06.272 --> 43:09.275
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.

43:17.049 --> 43:18.351
Look at all this stuff.

43:24.257 --> 43:26.190
How cool.

43:26.192 --> 43:28.860
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.

43:28.862 --> 43:29.895
The Black Shuck?

43:29.897 --> 43:31.829
It was a case
the Warrens investigated

43:31.831 --> 43:34.068
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

43:35.701 --> 43:37.370
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

43:47.681 --> 43:49.249
What's with the coins
over their eyes?

43:50.382 --> 43:51.384
What?

43:53.118 --> 43:54.451
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

43:54.453 --> 43:56.820
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

43:56.822 --> 43:57.889
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

43:57.891 --> 43:59.824
take their souls
to the underworld.

43:59.826 --> 44:01.192
It was his toll.

44:01.194 --> 44:03.261
Okay, we should go.

44:03.263 --> 44:05.962
It's okay. I sometimes
like to snoop, too.

44:05.964 --> 44:08.398
Do you know
what this does, Judy?

44:08.400 --> 44:10.703
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

44:13.072 --> 44:16.176
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

44:24.717 --> 44:26.416
- What's that?
- Um...

44:26.418 --> 44:29.056
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

44:29.922 --> 44:31.355
The wedding dress.

44:31.357 --> 44:32.960
It haunts people.

44:34.027 --> 44:36.830
And it makes them violent.

44:38.464 --> 44:39.996
Where is the dress now?

44:39.998 --> 44:41.301
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

44:44.804 --> 44:47.441
I mean, that's where
all this stuff is.

44:48.040 --> 44:48.974
Right, Judy?

44:48.976 --> 44:51.211
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

44:51.478 --> 44:52.809
Yeah.

44:52.811 --> 44:55.045
My dad says
that everything in there

44:55.047 --> 44:58.449
is either haunted, cursed,

44:58.451 --> 45:01.886
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

45:01.888 --> 45:03.320
What about the doll
that's in there?

45:03.322 --> 45:04.755
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

45:04.757 --> 45:05.759
No.

45:08.127 --> 45:09.763
Don't talk about her.

45:12.965 --> 45:13.967
Why not?

45:18.203 --> 45:20.406
She's in a case for a reason.

45:21.808 --> 45:23.474
Okay, we should go.

45:23.476 --> 45:24.541
I wonder what's on this.

45:24.543 --> 45:26.277
No, Daniela! Wait!

45:28.081 --> 45:30.848
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

45:30.850 --> 45:32.483
<i>along with all your minions...</i>

45:32.485 --> 45:34.085
<i>I command you</i>

45:34.087 --> 45:36.156
<i>to obey me to the letter!</i>

45:40.793 --> 45:43.828
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.

45:43.830 --> 45:46.864
Do something that's
actually appropriate.

45:46.866 --> 45:47.898
Come on,

45:47.900 --> 45:49.770
don't you at least wanna hear
about the samurai?

45:56.308 --> 45:57.808
What about this one?

45:57.810 --> 45:59.509
I don't remember that one.

45:59.511 --> 46:00.780
How do you play?

46:01.313 --> 46:03.183
Let's find out.

46:10.022 --> 46:12.190
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

46:12.192 --> 46:13.491
and whatever picture
it has on it

46:13.493 --> 46:14.826
is the object you try to find

46:14.828 --> 46:16.494
by feeling around
inside the box.

46:16.496 --> 46:18.429
If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

46:18.431 --> 46:19.433
then you get a point.

46:22.335 --> 46:23.835
You go first.

46:23.837 --> 46:24.905
Okay.

46:58.170 --> 46:59.306
You gonna get that?

47:00.473 --> 47:02.105
Yeah.

47:02.107 --> 47:04.208
Sorry, you guys keep playing.

47:04.210 --> 47:05.244
Oh, got a point.

47:07.112 --> 47:08.114
Nice.

47:30.469 --> 47:31.605
Hello?

47:49.656 --> 47:50.891
Hi, Mary Ellen.

47:51.491 --> 47:53.157
Hi.

47:53.159 --> 47:54.692
Remember how, at the store,

47:54.694 --> 47:56.626
Daniela said that
you were babysitting here?

47:56.628 --> 47:57.929
Yeah. Yeah.

47:57.931 --> 47:58.965
Me, too.

47:59.665 --> 48:01.601
Anyways, that's why I'm here.

48:02.101 --> 48:03.134
Oh.

48:03.136 --> 48:07.704
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.

48:07.706 --> 48:10.174
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.

48:10.176 --> 48:11.541
I just, uh...

48:11.543 --> 48:12.610
I mean, I would, but...

48:12.612 --> 48:14.581
Well...

48:15.614 --> 48:18.648
I just knew you were
gonna be here,

48:18.650 --> 48:21.953
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you

48:21.955 --> 48:23.621
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.

48:23.623 --> 48:25.588
Bob's-Got-Balls!

48:25.590 --> 48:27.994
Nice.

48:28.728 --> 48:30.230
You two sharing some pizza?

48:32.197 --> 48:34.134
- I should get the money.
- Yeah.

48:36.235 --> 48:38.268
Are you two, like...

48:38.270 --> 48:40.438
I... I wish.

48:40.440 --> 48:43.409
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?

48:44.210 --> 48:46.277
- Woo her?
- Yeah.

48:46.279 --> 48:50.480
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.

48:50.482 --> 48:52.616
You mean
girls like Mary Ellen.

48:52.618 --> 48:54.050
What did I say?

48:54.052 --> 48:55.152
Guys.

48:56.456 --> 48:58.322
So, how do I woo her?

48:58.324 --> 49:00.991
There's only one way to woo.

49:00.993 --> 49:02.261
It's obvious.

49:02.728 --> 49:04.397
Rock and roll.

49:07.667 --> 49:09.065
Here. Keep it.

49:09.067 --> 49:10.000
Sweet.

49:10.002 --> 49:12.636
Thanks, and that means
you can keep this.

49:12.638 --> 49:15.473
Minus one slice.

49:15.475 --> 49:17.641
I enjoyed that in the car.

49:17.643 --> 49:19.012
See you later, Balls.

49:20.112 --> 49:22.512
I would invite you in,
but like I said...

49:22.514 --> 49:24.148
No, yeah, it's cool.

49:24.150 --> 49:26.653
I thought I'd just stop by
and say hi, I guess, so...

49:27.652 --> 49:29.121
I'm glad you did.

49:29.755 --> 49:31.123
Me, too.

49:34.192 --> 49:36.594
Hey, Bob, um...

49:36.596 --> 49:38.264
How come they call you that?

49:39.665 --> 49:41.098
Um...

49:41.100 --> 49:43.099
Well, you know how
I'm the equipments manager

49:43.101 --> 49:44.136
for the basketball team?

49:45.038 --> 49:46.204
- Yeah.
- That's why.

49:46.206 --> 49:49.239
There's not really, like,
a story or anything behind it.

49:49.241 --> 49:50.574
Just like,
"Hey, I need balls."

49:50.576 --> 49:53.244
I'm, like,
"I got it. Balls. Got 'em."

49:56.748 --> 49:58.315
I'll see woo later.

49:58.317 --> 49:59.650
You. You. I'll see you later.

49:59.652 --> 50:01.253
I'm gonna go.

50:02.355 --> 50:03.520
Bye, Bob.

50:03.522 --> 50:04.623
Bye.

50:16.069 --> 50:17.268
<i>All right, Carolyn,</i>

54:28.554 --> 54:29.623
Bob?

54:34.592 --> 54:35.525
He left.

54:35.527 --> 54:38.362
Hmm, hopefully he went home
to practice.

54:38.364 --> 54:39.996
Okay. Back up to bed.

54:39.998 --> 54:41.433
- Daniela.
- Yeah, yeah.

54:48.107 --> 54:49.706
I'd feel better
if you let me stay.

54:49.708 --> 54:50.840
I can wake up early.

54:50.842 --> 54:52.375
We don't even
have to tell Judy.

54:52.377 --> 54:53.576
No. No, it's fine.

54:53.578 --> 54:54.580
Go home.

54:55.714 --> 54:56.913
But...

54:56.915 --> 54:58.715
But what?

54:58.717 --> 55:00.116
Thank you for coming.

55:00.118 --> 55:02.920
I actually think
it helped Judy a lot.

55:02.922 --> 55:04.420
Sorry you didn't get to see
any cobwebs

55:04.422 --> 55:05.521
or hear any creepy music.

55:05.523 --> 55:07.891
Well, the Bob thing
was kind of creepy, at least.

55:09.027 --> 55:11.862
But if Bob comes knocking
on this door late at night,

55:11.864 --> 55:13.996
forget you're you for a minute
and let him in.

55:16.701 --> 55:18.638
Call me tomorrow
and tell me the details.

55:19.638 --> 55:21.040
There will be
no details to tell.

55:46.531 --> 55:47.533
Shit.

57:12.150 --> 57:13.719
How'd her dad die?

57:15.487 --> 57:17.956
I don't know if that's
the best bedtime story.

57:18.958 --> 57:20.924
Look who my parents are.

57:20.926 --> 57:22.161
I'm used to it.

57:23.661 --> 57:24.761
Well,

57:24.763 --> 57:28.898
the short of it is that
he died in a car accident.

57:28.900 --> 57:31.571
And the long of it is that...

57:32.203 --> 57:34.173
Daniela was driving.

57:35.574 --> 57:37.174
Was it her fault?

57:37.176 --> 57:38.708
No.

57:38.710 --> 57:39.909
There's only one person

57:39.911 --> 57:41.814
who actually thinks
it was her fault.

59:34.860 --> 59:35.862
Okay.

59:36.661 --> 59:38.130
Let's try this again.

59:41.366 --> 59:43.300
If there is
a presence here...

01:00:22.674 --> 01:00:23.676
Dad?

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.244
Dad?

01:01:38.784 --> 01:01:39.882
You did this to me!

01:01:39.884 --> 01:01:42.351
It's all your fault!

01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:44.221
Get back here!

01:01:44.223 --> 01:01:45.922
You did this to me!

01:02:27.933 --> 01:02:29.266
No, no, no. Please.

01:02:29.268 --> 01:02:30.366
Please, no, no. Don't go.

01:02:30.368 --> 01:02:31.369
Don't go.

01:02:38.944 --> 01:02:40.210
No, no, no. No, come here.

01:02:40.212 --> 01:02:41.880

No. No.

<i>Good morning.

01:08:07.371 --> 01:08:09.607
<i>Just a second.</i>

01:08:17.413 --> 01:08:20.216
<i>He had
silver coins for his eyes.</i>

01:08:20.218 --> 01:08:21.518

<i>I just wanna find my sister.</i>

01:08:26.892 --> 01:08:28.858
<i>And when
did she first see him?</i>

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:31.493
<i>Not long
before he took her.</i>

01:08:31.495 --> 01:08:34.732
<i>She said she'd wake up,
and he'd be in her room...</i>

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:39.402
<i>watching her sleep.</i>

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:43.840
<i>The night she went missing,
we both woke up to a noise.</i>

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:46.712
<i>It sounded like a coin
falling on the floor.</i>

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:50.182
<i>She told me
to wait in her room.</i>

01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:54.152
<i>So I did.</i>

01:08:55.419 --> 01:08:56.888
<i>She never came back.</i>

01:08:58.256 --> 01:09:01.727
<i>I went to look for her and
ended up in a long hallway.</i>

01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:05.830
<i>Filled with coffins.</i>

01:09:07.398 --> 01:09:08.801
<i>Last night...</i>

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.935
<i>I woke up to a noise.</i>

01:09:11.937 --> 01:09:13.906
<i>Another coin being dropped.</i>

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.841
<i>It was like he was...</i>

01:09:18.843 --> 01:09:22.211
<i>Like he was calling me.</i>

01:09:28.352 --> 01:09:29.586
<i>he'll take your soul.</i>

01:09:31.956 --> 01:09:34.689
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

01:09:35.794 --> 01:09:37.827
<i>If you don't pay his toll,</i>

01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:38.961
<i>he'll take your soul.</i>

01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:43.497
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

01:09:44.768 --> 01:09:46.868
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:40.571
Shit! Shit! Shit! No.

01:14:36.995 --> 01:14:38.864
Judy! Judy!

01:14:39.963 --> 01:14:41.264
Judy!

01:14:42.834 --> 01:14:44.800
Judy!

01:14:44.802 --> 01:14:46.938
Judy! Open the door, Judy!

01:16:34.044 --> 01:16:36.047
I like your dolls.

01:16:43.254 --> 01:16:44.756
Judy! Judy!

01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:55.233
Go out the back!

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.775
We're trapped.

01:17:09.379 --> 01:17:11.713
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, thank God. Mrs. Warren?

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.948
- Mom?
- <i>Mary Ellen? Judy?</i>

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.451
<i>Is everything okay?
What's going on?</i>

01:17:15.453 --> 01:17:17.452
Judy's fine. Um...

01:17:17.454 --> 01:17:20.288
Something is happening
inside your house

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.823
and I don't think
it's safe to go outside.

01:17:21.825 --> 01:17:23.628
We're not really sure
what to do.

01:17:25.029 --> 01:17:27.031
<i>Can I speak to Annabelle?</i>

01:17:31.102 --> 01:17:32.400
I'm sorry?

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:34.772
<i>You need to give her
a soul, dear.</i>

01:17:36.941 --> 01:17:40.076
- What?
- <i>A soul. She wants her soul.</i>

01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:43.179
<i>Give me her soul.</i>

01:19:17.909 --> 01:19:19.809
Wait! Don't!

01:19:19.811 --> 01:19:21.377
I'm so sorry.

01:19:21.379 --> 01:19:22.912
What are you doing here?

01:19:43.267 --> 01:19:44.600
Annabelle.

01:19:44.602 --> 01:19:47.372
The doll. She's the one
who's doing all of this.

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:50.005
A doll?

01:19:50.007 --> 01:19:52.777
She wants a soul.

01:19:59.517 --> 01:20:02.120
I just wanted
to see him again.

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:07.223
What did you do?

01:20:07.225 --> 01:20:09.861
I wanted to tell him
I'm sorry.

01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:12.831
I know it was my fault.

01:20:13.496 --> 01:20:14.999
Daniela...

01:20:15.633 --> 01:20:17.068
what did you do?

01:20:20.204 --> 01:20:21.973
I let her out.

01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:25.075
What else did you touch?

01:20:28.913 --> 01:20:30.214
Everything.

01:20:37.221 --> 01:20:39.456
Run! Run! Go!

01:20:46.396 --> 01:20:48.564
Mary Ellen!

01:20:48.566 --> 01:20:51.166
It's her asthma.
She's having an attack.

01:20:51.168 --> 01:20:52.504
The inhaler's in her car.

01:20:53.204 --> 01:20:54.438
I'll go get it.

01:20:56.273 --> 01:20:57.508
No! Let me!

01:22:27.999 --> 01:22:29.367
Judy! Run!

01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:51.523
Mary Ellen!

01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:54.292
Here.

01:22:56.494 --> 01:22:57.629
Are you okay?

01:23:03.467 --> 01:23:06.769
Where's Daniela?
She came after you.

01:23:06.771 --> 01:23:08.103
Mary Ellen?

01:23:08.105 --> 01:23:10.204
Judy? I'm up here.

01:23:10.206 --> 01:23:12.610
No. That's not Daniela.

01:23:14.145 --> 01:23:15.746
Something has a hold of her.
I can feel it.

01:23:21.485 --> 01:23:22.618
What do we do?

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.189
We have to find Annabelle.

01:23:25.222 --> 01:23:27.025
We have to put her back
in the case.

01:23:27.657 --> 01:23:29.259
Do you know where she is?

01:23:32.195 --> 01:23:33.197
No.

01:24:01.157 --> 01:24:02.526
Wait, wait, Judy, don't.

01:24:08.865 --> 01:24:10.701
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:24:12.203 --> 01:24:13.204
Right?

01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:33.624
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:24:35.226 --> 01:24:36.628
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:24:38.329 --> 01:24:39.630
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:24:40.798 --> 01:24:42.500
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:25:35.585 --> 01:25:37.121
What did you say?

01:25:37.687 --> 01:25:39.190
Come on, let's go.

01:26:04.949 --> 01:26:06.384
Come on.

01:26:21.397 --> 01:26:22.534
I'll get her.

01:26:28.638 --> 01:26:31.208
No, no, no.
No! Just stop!

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:34.743
Where do your parents
keep the key?

01:26:34.745 --> 01:26:36.181
I don't know.
It's never locked.

01:27:00.937 --> 01:27:02.206
I know where the key is.

01:27:07.645 --> 01:27:09.547
- I'll get it.
- No! No, don't.

01:27:10.847 --> 01:27:12.216
I'll do it.

01:27:26.829 --> 01:27:27.831
Judy!

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.802
I got it.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.033
Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be Thy name.

01:29:24.681 --> 01:29:26.049
Oh, my God.

01:30:07.924 --> 01:30:09.090
Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:30:09.092 --> 01:30:10.125
and forgive us
for our trespasses

01:30:10.127 --> 01:30:12.493
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us.

01:30:22.105 --> 01:30:23.174
Mary Ellen?

01:30:30.914 --> 01:30:31.916
Go!

01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:40.221
Daniela.

01:30:40.223 --> 01:30:41.659
Daniela, please!

01:30:52.636 --> 01:30:54.002
Daniela, stop!

01:31:00.177 --> 01:31:01.646
Stop!

01:31:13.956 --> 01:31:15.692
<i>I command you, unclean spirit,</i>

01:31:16.593 --> 01:31:18.292
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

01:31:18.294 --> 01:31:20.127
<i>now attacking
this servant of God.</i>

01:31:20.129 --> 01:31:23.131
- <i>I command you to obey me to the letter.</i>
- Judy, run!

01:31:23.133 --> 01:31:25.734
<i>In his name,
they will take up serpents...</i>

01:31:26.937 --> 01:31:29.106
<i>...with his hands
and condemn all evil.</i>

01:31:30.606 --> 01:31:33.608
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:36.610
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

01:31:36.612 --> 01:31:40.081
- <i>To obey me to the letter.</i>
- <i>No, no.</i>

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:41.750
<i>I, who am a servant of God...</i>

01:31:41.752 --> 01:31:44.618
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.755
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

01:31:46.757 --> 01:31:48.826
<i>now attacking
this servant of God...</i>

01:32:13.749 --> 01:32:14.819
Judy!

01:32:32.235 --> 01:32:34.202
Judy! Judy. Judy.

01:32:34.204 --> 01:32:35.269
Get the doll!

01:32:43.179 --> 01:32:45.749
- Close it!
- I'm trying!

01:32:47.183 --> 01:32:48.817
Hurry!

01:32:53.923 --> 01:32:56.992
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:32:56.994 --> 01:32:58.393
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

01:32:58.395 --> 01:32:59.860
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:32:59.862 --> 01:33:01.261
Put her in!

01:33:01.263 --> 01:33:02.997
Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:33:02.999 --> 01:33:04.033
and forgive us
for our trespasses,

01:33:04.035 --> 01:33:06.900
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

01:33:06.902 --> 01:33:08.336
lead us not into temptation,

01:33:08.338 --> 01:33:09.807
but deliver us from evil...

01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:14.712
Amen.

01:33:23.387 --> 01:33:24.889
Is it over?

01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:29.627
The evil has been contained.

01:33:35.865 --> 01:33:37.198
Bob?

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.967
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

01:33:41.871 --> 01:33:43.070
- Are you okay?
- No!

01:33:43.072 --> 01:33:44.709
There was a werewolf outside!

01:33:45.307 --> 01:33:46.944
You saw the werewolf?

01:33:47.777 --> 01:33:49.243
Yeah.

01:33:49.245 --> 01:33:50.947
He saved me from it.

01:33:53.249 --> 01:33:54.250
You did?

01:33:56.786 --> 01:33:58.353
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:58.355 --> 01:33:59.953
Kind of.

01:33:59.955 --> 01:34:01.993
Maybe we should talk
about this somewhere else.

01:34:26.383 --> 01:34:27.982
<i>Good morning
from the staff</i>

01:34:27.984 --> 01:34:30.851
<i>of WPKW-PV6</i>

01:34:30.853 --> 01:34:33.287
<i>in Hartford, Connecticut.</i>

01:34:33.289 --> 01:34:36.292
<i>This is Hartford, Connecticut,
the land of steady habits...</i>

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.792
My parents.

01:34:37.794 --> 01:34:38.993
Shit! You're not supposed
to have boys over.

01:34:38.995 --> 01:34:41.061
I think that's the least of
our concerns right now, Bob.

01:34:41.063 --> 01:34:42.896
Yeah, yeah. I should
probably still get going.

01:34:42.898 --> 01:34:44.998
Hey, listen, um,
so Homecoming is coming up

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.835
- and I would really like...
- Yes. I'll... I'll go.

01:34:46.837 --> 01:34:47.769
With me?

01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:49.903
Yes, if the Warrens
don't kill me first.

01:34:51.842 --> 01:34:53.140
We tell them everything.

01:34:57.947 --> 01:34:58.980
Mom!

01:34:58.982 --> 01:35:01.515
Judy! What are you
doing up so early?

01:35:01.517 --> 01:35:03.283
Don't get mad...

01:35:03.285 --> 01:35:05.255
What happened
to your car?

01:35:10.293 --> 01:35:11.926
Here we go.

01:35:11.928 --> 01:35:13.698
We'll have
our own party, huh?

01:35:20.402 --> 01:35:23.139
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

01:35:30.914 --> 01:35:33.782
It won't always be like this,
I promise.

01:35:33.784 --> 01:35:35.315
You know,
and sooner or later,

01:35:35.317 --> 01:35:37.484
you'll find people
who understand.

01:35:37.486 --> 01:35:39.887
And as for young Anthony,

01:35:39.889 --> 01:35:41.859
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:43.925
Ed.

01:35:57.072 --> 01:35:58.174
Happy birthday, Judy.

01:35:59.375 --> 01:36:00.377
Thank you.

01:36:01.076 --> 01:36:02.112
Happy birthday.

01:36:05.382 --> 01:36:08.852
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

01:36:09.151 --> 01:36:10.518
Thanks.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.287
Come in.

01:36:12.289 --> 01:36:14.792
Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

01:36:15.525 --> 01:36:16.460
Sure.

01:36:18.328 --> 01:36:19.293
Um...

01:36:19.295 --> 01:36:22.031
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- Hey.

01:36:22.898 --> 01:36:24.232
Bob's-Got-Balls.

01:36:24.234 --> 01:36:25.899
No kidding.

01:36:25.901 --> 01:36:28.036
- Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

01:36:28.038 --> 01:36:29.604
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

01:36:29.606 --> 01:36:32.340
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- Hey, guys, welcome.

01:36:32.342 --> 01:36:34.141
Keep comin'.

01:36:34.143 --> 01:36:35.609
Happy birthday, Judy.

01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:37.147
- Anthony?
- I'm really sorry.

01:36:38.013 --> 01:36:39.984
Am I still invited?

01:36:41.484 --> 01:36:42.520
Sure.

01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:49.392
Daniela?

01:36:50.427 --> 01:36:52.226
I have something for you.

01:36:52.228 --> 01:36:53.429
For me?

01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:07.242
You found out the hard way

01:37:07.244 --> 01:37:10.644
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

01:37:10.646 --> 01:37:13.049
But you know
what I actually like about it?

01:37:15.317 --> 01:37:18.088
All the evil in here...

01:37:19.356 --> 01:37:22.893
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

01:37:38.941 --> 01:37:40.543
Darling Daniela.

01:37:45.981 --> 01:37:47.649
Did Judy tell you that?

01:37:47.651 --> 01:37:49.954
No. Your dad did.

01:37:54.557 --> 01:37:57.928
He also tells me
that he misses you.

01:38:00.195 --> 01:38:03.331
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

01:38:03.333 --> 01:38:05.565
'cause it was
not your fault.

01:38:15.611 --> 01:38:17.280
Thank you.

01:38:19.148 --> 01:38:20.614
Um...

01:38:20.616 --> 01:38:21.683
I'm sorry.

01:38:21.685 --> 01:38:23.051
Oh.

01:38:23.053 --> 01:38:24.351
It's okay.

01:38:24.353 --> 01:38:25.623
You're young.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.527
You know,
when I was about your age,

01:38:32.529 --> 01:38:35.697
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

01:38:35.699 --> 01:38:37.534
without telling my parents.

01:38:40.402 --> 01:38:42.403
I unleashed a demon.

01:38:42.405 --> 01:38:44.008
So not the same thing.

01:38:44.975 --> 01:38:46.977
Well, okay. True.

01:38:53.182 --> 01:38:55.451
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

01:38:56.386 --> 01:38:58.022
He was the boyfriend.

01:39:02.525 --> 01:39:04.391
