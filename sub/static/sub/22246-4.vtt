01:08.985 --> 01:11.488
-[clears throat]
-Oh! [chuckles]

01:11.571 --> 01:13.239
I didn't realize you were still
in the house.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.158
-I'm sorry to startle you.
-[rips paper]

01:15.241 --> 01:16.409
Here's the estimate.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.037
House looks good.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.664
Can't think you need much
beyond door and window sensors.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.833
I included in the cost three keypads.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.628
My husband wondered,

01:26.711 --> 01:29.172
would you ever just sell the stickers
for the windows

01:29.255 --> 01:31.382
and a sign for the front lawn?

01:31.883 --> 01:33.301
[chuckles]

01:34.344 --> 01:35.929
Signs come with the sensors, I'm afraid.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.598
Of course they do. [chuckles]
That makes sense.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.563

-Monte Rissell.
-[Holden] Monte Rissell.

03:56.694 --> 03:57.987
Falls Church, Virginia.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.365
They sentenced him a few weeks ago.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.284
Five victims, all women,
raped and murdered.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.410
Method?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.122
First and last victim were beaten
and then drowned. Middle three stabbed.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.833
-I thought one of them was shot, no?
-No.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.275
Virginia State Penitentiary.
Monte Ralph Rissell.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.374
Monte Rissell.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.586
-Why don't you have a seat?
-Monte.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.672
Hey, you guys need me for any of this?

04:57.755 --> 05:00.091
No, thank you.
We'd prefer to talk with you alone.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.345
[guard] Behave yourself, Rissell. Move.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.975
My name's Bill Tench.
This is my partner, Holden Ford.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.185
We're from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation's

05:11.269 --> 05:12.729
Behavioral Science Unit.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.982
-Scientists?
-We're from the Behavioral Science Unit.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.026
We're doing research.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.695
Interviewing... men like you.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.696
[scoffs]

05:22.322 --> 05:23.531
Men like me?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.533
[Tench] Murderers with multiple victims.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.702
To better understand
why you do what you do.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.080
I'd like to know, too.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.925
-You think this might help?
-Help with what?

05:44.343 --> 05:45.678
Find a cure.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.181
[Tench] No idea.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.265
[Monte scoffs]

05:50.266 --> 05:51.893
[grunts]

05:56.064 --> 05:57.482
Think I could get some Big Red?

05:58.608 --> 05:59.776
"Big Red"?

06:00.401 --> 06:01.652
Pop.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.071
You know, like, soda.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.115
Used to have it when I was a kid.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.826
-I always loved Big Red.
-[Holden] Um...

06:09.327 --> 06:11.954
-We'll see what we can do.
-That'll depend on the insights.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.665
I can't get stuff like that in here.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.292
What do you say
we get down to brass tacks?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.503
What do you want to know?

06:22.423 --> 06:24.300
Why I raped those girls in Florida?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.886
For starters,
how did you choose your victims?

06:26.969 --> 06:27.804
Victims?

06:29.597 --> 06:30.765
That doesn't sound good.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.892
No, it doesn't.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.564
How many other...
"men like me" are you talking to?

06:38.648 --> 06:39.816
Quite a few, Monte.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.984
They all talk to you?

06:43.903 --> 06:46.322
It's... early days.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.490
Hmm...

06:49.617 --> 06:51.994
-Really think you can get some Big Red?
-Look at me, Monte.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.663
Let's stay on track.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.749
You know what?

06:57.708 --> 07:00.086
-I don't think I'm interested.
-Fine.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.756
You want to diddle around,
we'll walk out of here.

07:04.715 --> 07:09.428
We'll go have a nice, leisurely lunch
wherever the fuck we want,

07:10.555 --> 07:13.516
and then take the picturesque drive
back to Quantico.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.145
What's the rest of your day look like?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.733
What my partner's too polite to say is,
we're talking to men like you

07:22.817 --> 07:23.818
because we can't understand

07:23.901 --> 07:26.446
how someone could fuck up their life
so completely

07:26.529 --> 07:28.322
before he's barely old enough to vote.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.742
Okay.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.954
[sighs]

07:35.872 --> 07:38.082
I first got into trouble at 14.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.419
They sent me to Florida. This, uh...

07:41.502 --> 07:44.255
[laughs] ..."juvenile facility."

07:45.548 --> 07:48.301
Doctors watching over me all the time.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.682
I had four girls
while I was under observation.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.185
But you didn't kill those girls
in Florida, that came later.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.438
What was different when you came back
from the hospital? What changed?

08:01.022 --> 08:01.981
Hmm...

08:03.900 --> 08:05.067
Let's see.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.403
They let me out.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.906
I come back up here,

08:09.989 --> 08:12.325
get myself a job, a girlfriend.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.453
Girlfriend's a year ahead,
she goes off to state college,

08:15.536 --> 08:18.581
but, you know, we keep in touch, we write.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.751
You're taping it, man.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.045
Taking notes helps with transcription.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.589
You were saying?
Back in school, a free man...

08:26.672 --> 08:28.466
[Monte] Not free, no, sir.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.220
Probation, counseling, therapy.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.431
I gotta keep checking in
or they send me back.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.350
But you got yourself a girlfriend...

08:37.892 --> 08:38.809
Do I, though?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.479
You know chicks.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.940
She sends me a letter.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.360
Tells me, shocker, there's all these guys
up at school, you know.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.486
There's all this, uh...

08:52.198 --> 08:56.035
She tells me, in so many words,
she wants to ball other guys.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.664
What am I supposed to do with that?

09:00.373 --> 09:04.210
I hop in the car, gotta see it
for myself, and what do you know,

09:04.293 --> 09:06.045
there she is, making out with some dork.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.966
What a dumbshit, right?

09:10.925 --> 09:11.842
Chicks.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.512
What can you do?

09:15.304 --> 09:18.432
You can't live with them. [snickers]

09:20.518 --> 09:22.520
I'll tell you what you can fucking do.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.982
I get some beer,
because I'm fucking angry,

09:26.440 --> 09:27.817
I have some weed,

09:28.359 --> 09:30.903
and I'm smoking, and thinking,

09:30.987 --> 09:34.323
and driving, and drinking, and then...

09:36.200 --> 09:37.451
Then I'm back at my apartment,

09:38.327 --> 09:39.870
in the parking lot,

09:39.954 --> 09:41.914
no idea how I got there.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.251
A car pulls into the lot.

09:45.793 --> 09:49.672
Girl on her own, maybe 20, 25.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
It's got to be four in the morning.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.636
It's like...

09:56.178 --> 09:58.014
the idea of doing it

09:59.515 --> 10:01.601
pops in your head like a...

10:02.560 --> 10:03.394
[exhales]

10:05.354 --> 10:07.648
Like a sneeze, you know what I mean?

10:08.816 --> 10:11.485
I hop out the car, tap on the window,

10:11.986 --> 10:13.195
pull the gun,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.114
drag her into the woods,

10:15.197 --> 10:18.451
rip her fucking panties off,
hike up her skirt.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.662
"Oh, yeah, give it to me, baby!
I want it, I'm so horny."

10:21.746 --> 10:23.831
I'm trying to rape her,
but she won't shut up.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.042
She takes off screaming,

10:26.125 --> 10:28.252
runs through the parking lot,
down a ravine.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.297
You know, she's stronger than me,
but I'm fast.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.842
I catch up to her.
I get her in a headlock.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.135
I choke her.

10:36.218 --> 10:40.473
We go rolling down the hill into a stream.
The whole thing is fucking chaos.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.475
I smash her head against a rock,

10:43.100 --> 10:44.602
hold her underwater...

10:47.021 --> 10:48.397
and that's that.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.484
No more drama.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.821
You had a gun, why not use it?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.241
I wanted to cool her off.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.576
Do you think-- Pardon me.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.872
Do you think it would've ended differently
if she hadn't...

11:06.207 --> 11:08.584
-Like, if she wasn't--
-[Monte] Wasn't what?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.752
A fucking prostitute?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.422
Yeah, could be. Could be.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.385
Your science buddy
might have something there.

11:19.178 --> 11:24.016
Second time, this blonde chick,
she will not stop with the questions.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.894
I have her driving at gunpoint,
and she's like,

11:26.977 --> 11:29.730
"Why are you doing this?
Don't you have a girlfriend?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.358
What are you planning to do? Why me?"

11:32.441 --> 11:33.692
Is that why you stabbed her?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.403
I had to.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.822
Shut her the fuck up.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.491
[Tench] Then you drove around for hours
in her car.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.411
Yeah.

11:44.453 --> 11:48.541
By the third girl, you could say
I had, uh... perfected the routine.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.917
You stabbed her, too?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.544
Yeah.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.923
I stabbed her so many times.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.967
Yeesh...

11:58.843 --> 12:01.137
[clicks tongue]
I did let one of 'em go, though.

12:04.056 --> 12:04.974
Yeah.

12:05.349 --> 12:09.145
We're in the car, I'm getting ready,
she has no idea.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.023
All of a sudden she starts crying,
out of nowhere.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.193
Tells me her daddy's dying... Cancer.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.490
My brother had cancer.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.243
Cancer. It's, uh...

12:24.952 --> 12:26.162
It's a bitch, man.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.665
Yeah, it's hard on a human being.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.625
So I let her go.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.086
It's, uh...

12:36.172 --> 12:39.592
-It's a weird feeling, man.
-What's a weird feeling, Monte?

12:39.675 --> 12:40.593
Um...

12:41.802 --> 12:43.220
How do I put it?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.974
-Showing mercy.
-[Tench] What?

12:47.057 --> 12:50.561
Come on, kid. You don't expect us
to buy your mercy horseshit.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.063
I think what Agent Tench means is--

12:53.147 --> 12:55.357
I think I've had enough science
for one day.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.694
Throat's a little dry.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.439
-Maybe next time you should be careful--
-Holden.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.150
-I didn't say anything.
-You don't have to. I get it.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.361
-Let's move on.
-I wasn't going to reprimand you.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.737
I hope not.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.406
Okay, we're moving on.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.213
[Tench]  Here's the thing.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.383
Monte Rissell danced around a bunch
of psychiatrists when he was a kid.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.343
Did the same thing when he was on parole.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.595
He's an Olympic-class bullshitter.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.098
Why do we think
he's being honest with us?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.726
But we don't think
he's being completely honest. Do we?

14:13.727 --> 14:17.147
We just need to extract what's useful
and discard the rest.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.149
So my mistake with Rissell was what?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.317
[horn honks]

14:22.611 --> 14:24.154
[horn blaring]

14:24.238 --> 14:27.157
[panting]

14:27.241 --> 14:29.743
-You okay?
-Yeah.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.829
[grunts]

14:33.247 --> 14:34.081
[man] Fuck!

14:34.373 --> 14:37.626
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck's the matter with you?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.295
What were you doing, 80, 100?!

14:39.378 --> 14:41.547
-You turned without looking!
-You were speeding!

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
-Doesn't matter! I had the right of way!
-Doesn't matter?

14:43.674 --> 14:46.051
-That's the law, buddy.
-The law?!

14:46.135 --> 14:48.804
-No. Here's the fucking law, pal!
-You can't do that.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.889
I'm gonna call the police!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.182
Stay away from me, man!

14:54.685 --> 14:56.103
Unbelievable!

14:56.186 --> 14:58.397
[Tench] You fucking moron.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.732
[horn continues blaring]

15:02.359 --> 15:03.736
You sure you're all right?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.367
[indistinct chatter]

15:19.418 --> 15:23.047
[Holden] No, I get it. You got a lot
going on. It's a lot of pressure.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.342
I completely understand.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.887
Let me talk to Bill
and I'll call you back.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.141
[sighs]

15:39.188 --> 15:40.356
Is that for me?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.359
Thanks. Debbie says hi.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.281
It's fine. As soon as class is over,
she'll come down.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.119
She says she'd rather us get a room
so she can pick us up in the morning.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.123
I'm a little ticked off.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.167
I get Debbie doesn't want to do
all that driving,

16:00.250 --> 16:02.670
but we have a situation here.
I'm asking her for help.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.840
Okay, she's got midterms
and that's on her mind, but...

16:08.634 --> 16:09.635
[exhales]

16:10.427 --> 16:11.720
Why am I so upset?

16:13.389 --> 16:16.058
Maybe 'cause she can't drop everything
when you call.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
Because she doesn't want to.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.483
[man] Here you go.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.321
-One more, please.
-[man] Yes, sir.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.323
You want to call Nancy?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.533
[inhales]

16:33.242 --> 16:34.576
[exhales]

16:43.877 --> 16:45.754
[exhales slowly]

16:45.838 --> 16:47.006
Are you okay?

16:49.758 --> 16:50.759
Or we could just eat.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.725
I didn't see it coming, Holden.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.770
You could've been killed,
and I didn't see it coming.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.236
It's one thing if it's the job.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.197
But some fucking Pinto
comes shooting out of nowhere...

17:13.741 --> 17:15.284
I think if I called Nancy,

17:15.826 --> 17:17.202
if I heard her voice,

17:18.787 --> 17:19.997
I'd just lose it.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.628
You know, we adopted a boy...

17:28.005 --> 17:29.214
three years ago.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.216
He's six now.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.721
Nancy always wanted a family.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.474
And I guess I did, too.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.146
But we can't have kids of our own, so...

17:45.397 --> 17:46.815
It's not going well.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.110
He's a beautiful boy.

17:52.237 --> 17:56.075
At first, I thought he was just quiet,
you know, a quiet baby,

17:56.158 --> 17:57.493
nothing wrong with that.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.412
He can speak,

18:02.331 --> 18:03.457
he just won't.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.170
I feel like we're failing him somehow.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.174
I'm sure you're not.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.177
Maybe he was like this before.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.805
But it's a real strain.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.976
It's supposed to be this great thing,
having a son.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.019
God, Bill.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.147
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.233
When the car was spinning out, I just...

18:33.403 --> 18:35.572
You have no idea what I'm trying to say,
do you?

18:36.448 --> 18:37.741
Not exactly...

18:40.202 --> 18:41.453
but I want to.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.579
I don't know either.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.165
It's nothing, it's fine.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.875
Seriously, Bill...

18:47.376 --> 18:48.502
Call Debbie.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.547
Tell her she can come get us
in the morning.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.689
[Tench on tape]  Come on, kid.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.858
You don't expect us to buy
your mercy horseshit.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.027
[Holden]
I think what Agent Tench means is--

19:14.111 --> 19:16.280
[Monte]  I think I've had enough science
for one day.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.544
-Well, should we hear it again?
-Eventually, yeah.

19:33.297 --> 19:38.135
Okay. So there are two triggers,
one right after the other, for Rissell.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.095
Maybe trigger is the wrong word.
Too facile.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.306
Also, in law enforcement,
has more than one meaning.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.933
What about stresses? Stressors.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.186
Let's make that our term of art.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.063
Stress is more internal anyway.
It's more appropriate to our focus.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.982
So, two stressors set Rissell off?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.567
Her letter, obviously.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.445
So, the girlfriend writes him
a Dear John letter and he--

19:56.528 --> 19:57.613
Rissell cracks.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.657
-But he doesn't call her or write back.
-No, he goes down there.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.826
-Stalks her like a hunter.
-[Holden] Not like a hunter.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.788
He doesn't kill the girlfriend,
he only watches her with her new beau.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.248
-Big difference.
-"Beau"?

20:08.332 --> 20:11.001
So what if Rissell doesn't mean to kill
anyone at this point?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.753
He's still on track for rape,

20:12.836 --> 20:14.963
but it's this first victim's compliance

20:15.047 --> 20:17.299
that just kind of pushes him
over the edge.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.760
He kills the first one
because she likes it or pretends to?

20:19.843 --> 20:21.136
[Holden] It's dominoes.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.554
Her compliance makes him angry.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.681
He throws her out of the car,
she tries to escape.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.726
Where is it? He says,
"The whole thing is just fucking chaos."

20:27.809 --> 20:30.354
-He needed to reassert control.
-Exactly.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.941
Which means that the victim's behavior
is also a stressor.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.194
I mean, it may be that they can't change
the ultimate outcome,

20:37.277 --> 20:39.196
but they can affect
when and how it happens.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.074
Exactly what I was thinking,
which is why I asked the question.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.825
But... [sighs]

20:43.909 --> 20:44.952
But what?

20:45.035 --> 20:46.453
Isn't that just life?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.205
Your girlfriend dumps you?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.749
You're trying to be intimate with someone,
and it goes wrong?

20:50.832 --> 20:54.169
Obviously, not that wrong, but it seems
like Rissell just couldn't hack life.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.714
Well, what else is a criminal except
somebody who can't function in society?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.299
If we want to be reductive,

20:59.383 --> 21:01.927
we can say these men can't handle
normal stages of development--

21:02.010 --> 21:04.471
Why do I get the sense
"reductive" is your worst insult?

21:04.554 --> 21:06.682
Not at all. I meant to say you were right.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.436
How would most men feel
if they were being intimate with a woman

21:11.520 --> 21:14.523
and they sensed
that she wasn't enjoying herself?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.236
Come on, be scientists.

21:20.821 --> 21:21.822
Disappointed.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.950
-It would feel awful.
-Right.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.660
You want her to have a good time.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.496
[Carr] But when Rissell sensed
that his victim was enjoying herself,

21:29.579 --> 21:31.290
it turned him into a murderer.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.042
So, yes, what happens to these men
is normal,

21:34.126 --> 21:35.836
but the way that they process it is not.

21:35.919 --> 21:39.214
That's our goal, to dig into the why,
like you did with Kemper.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.133
[Tench] We're headed to Altoona
for Road School.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.927
We'll try and see Rissell again
when we get back, if he'll see us.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.306
This is gonna take twice as long
if you can't do the interviews full-time.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.101
What is it? A question of money,
of institutional rigidity,

21:51.184 --> 21:52.144
scheduling, what?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.395
All of the above.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.732
You know, I've been in academia
all my life, let me see what I can do.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.079
Honey, I gotta go.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.668
[Nancy] Brian.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.295
Come on.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.047
Give your father a hug.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.673
Say goodbye.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.438
[Tench] See you soon, son.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.213
Ready?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.048
Yep.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.219
[Holden] All yours.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.224
-[buzzer sounding]
-[sighs]

23:12.808 --> 23:14.684
[Monte] Ain't easy to get
on the East Coast.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.019
No, it's not.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.772
So you're not from the East Coast,
originally?

23:23.819 --> 23:24.736
What?

23:25.737 --> 23:28.073
I'm sorry, I missed that.
I'm a little deaf.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.159
I was just asking if you consider yourself
an East Coaster?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.786
You don't have that in your file?

23:34.871 --> 23:36.832
You were born in Wellington,
South Kansas.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.083
You're the youngest of three,

23:38.166 --> 23:39.960
and your parents divorced
when you were seven.

23:40.043 --> 23:43.255
That's all in the file,
just not what you have to say about it.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.007
Yeah, my mom blamed that on me.
No idea why.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.635
My brother and sister were around,

23:48.718 --> 23:51.680
but it was always on me
when things went bad.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.349
Pretty soon after,
Mom up and married Hank.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.436
-Dragged us out to Sacramento.
-You wanted to stay in Kansas?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.564
[Monte] Be with my real father? You bet.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.608
I did not want to be in California,
that's for sure.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.987
Nobody wanted me there, either.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.823
Did your mother say
she didn't want you there?

24:16.121 --> 24:17.789
Why you always want to do that after?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.083
Crush the can.

24:21.001 --> 24:21.835
It feels good.

24:23.086 --> 24:23.920
Yeah, maybe.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.506
What made you think
nobody wanted you in California?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.675
[Monte] Mom wanted to be with Hank.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.844
And Hank didn't want to raise
somebody else's kids,

24:30.927 --> 24:32.804
so he bought us shit.

24:33.430 --> 24:38.310
Thought that'd be enough.
When I was seven, he bought me a gun.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.563
-He bought you a gun?
-BB gun.

24:42.981 --> 24:46.526
My brother and sister were drinking,
smoking a lot of weed,

24:46.610 --> 24:47.986
doing all kinds of shit.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.031
Sometimes they'd share.

24:52.115 --> 24:55.035
When I was nine,
I shot my cousin in the ass with that gun.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.830
That made me star of the show. I mean,
everybody fucking hated my cousin.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.041
So you kids were left all alone.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.835
Hank broke the fucking thing over my head.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.754
-[Tench] He beat you?
-Yeah.

25:06.713 --> 25:07.839
It's how I burst my eardrum.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.178
I got into all kinds of shit, man.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.515
Broke into some lady's house,
stole a hundred bucks.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.728
Mom and Hank divorced when I was 12,
that was kind of my doing.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.148
Fourteen, things got a little worse.

25:25.232 --> 25:28.860
Burglary, larceny, car theft, rape twice.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.947
My mom somehow got them
to send me to Florida.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.241
Thanks, Ma!

25:36.660 --> 25:41.373
I get back. I'm 17, living on my own,
working double shifts at Pizza Hut.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.876
Nobody wanted me, man.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.965
Nobody on this earth ever wanted me.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.468
Put that on your fucking tape.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.889
If only they'd let me stay with my dad...

25:58.723 --> 26:00.141
it'd all be different.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.936
I might even be a lawyer.

26:03.019 --> 26:06.064
-So your dad wanted you?
-[Monte] Have a nice car.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.066
House.

26:08.858 --> 26:12.195
Be out in the backyard
perfecting my recipe for barbecue.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.658
I'd have found my way.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.260
So Rissell's the real victim here?

26:35.969 --> 26:37.762
That's how he sees it, sure.

26:38.513 --> 26:42.809
A pathological liar who murdered
five women sees himself as the victim.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.563
And we're giving him a shoulder to cry on.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.773
We're not giving him a shoulder to cry on.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.443
We're not flattering him. Or helping him.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.279
We're using him.

27:02.912 --> 27:03.913
Yeah, okay.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.793
[Tench] Motive, means, opportunity.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.756
The three pillars of criminal
investigation: what, why, who.

27:12.839 --> 27:13.965
What happened...

27:14.549 --> 27:16.551
When I'm involved
in a hostage negotiation,

27:16.634 --> 27:18.762
the perpetrator is standing
right in front of me.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.765
[indistinct chatter]

27:31.399 --> 27:33.318
-Not a bad group tonight.
-Yeah.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.073
[Tench] We got one?

27:39.991 --> 27:42.202
Look at him just standing there,
watching us.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.871
He's just having a cigarette
before he heads home.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.211
See how he's deliberately trying
not to look at us?

27:51.294 --> 27:53.338
He's screwing up the nerve to approach.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.841
-I put the over-under at half a minute.
-I'll definitely take under.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.052
-That's a bet.
-Loser buys dinner.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.473
Look out, he's on the move.

28:09.062 --> 28:09.979
Hey.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.483
You guys mind if I bother you a minute?

28:13.566 --> 28:14.692
Sure. What's up?

28:15.693 --> 28:17.529
Beverly Jean Shaw, 22.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.740
Never came home
from her babysitting job.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.077
Four days later, we find her in the dump
on Wopsononock Mountain.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.957
Um, based on stomach contents,
we think she was killed right away,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.583
around midnight Wednesday.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.671
She was sitting like this at the dump
for four days?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.548
Well, no, um...

28:38.174 --> 28:40.093
See, there wasn't enough, um...

28:41.219 --> 28:43.388
If she had been at the dump four days--

28:43.471 --> 28:45.890
We'd see more insect infestation
and animal trauma.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.768
So, between when she was murdered
on Wednesday

28:48.852 --> 28:50.603
and the body was discovered
four days later,

28:50.687 --> 28:51.813
she had to be someplace else?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.483
[Holden] Her breasts.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.612
They were, I guess you'd say... amputated.

29:00.613 --> 29:04.325
-Um, we have not been able to locate them.
-Was this postmortem or...

29:04.409 --> 29:07.203
[officer] Coroner said she was
already dead. Yes, sir.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.872
[exhales] He blacked both her eyes,

29:09.372 --> 29:12.292
broke her jaw, multiple stab wounds.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.795
You can see he kind of
frogged her legs out there.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.798
[sighs]

29:18.882 --> 29:20.216
And there was, um...

29:31.728 --> 29:32.729
Sorry.

29:34.355 --> 29:35.774
We don't get this kind of thing.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.108
-It's hard to--
-Take your time.

29:42.655 --> 29:45.867
There was an incision. From her--
[clears throat]

29:46.868 --> 29:50.622
From her vagina to her, um... anus.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.210
-God damn it. I'm sorry.
-You're doing fine.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.379
-The family local?
-Uh...

29:58.463 --> 29:59.756
Parents upstate. Fiancé in town.

30:02.509 --> 30:05.887
-You don't think somebody local did this?
-Hard to say at this point.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.431
I go to church with these people.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.184
We get peeping Toms, sure.
But something like this?

30:11.267 --> 30:12.727
It doesn't make sense.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.898
To go from shoplifters
and underage kids buying beer to...

30:19.234 --> 30:22.153
what happened to Beverly...
Has to be an outsider.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.989
Draped over the ironing board here,
is that human hair?

30:26.574 --> 30:27.659
Yes, sir.

30:27.742 --> 30:28.743
You have it?

30:30.537 --> 30:31.454
Sure.

30:31.871 --> 30:33.540
Yeah, Forensics bagged it up.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.334
It's all about Forensics.
I am starting to appreciate that.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.628
[Holden] And the ironing board,
you take that as well?

30:38.711 --> 30:42.173
Uh, I mean, we dusted it for fingerprints
and everything, but, uh...

30:43.758 --> 30:47.512
But you do think the unsub scalped Beverly
and then draped it over the ironing board?

30:48.847 --> 30:49.764
That mean something?

30:51.766 --> 30:53.101
Everything in this photo has meaning.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.854
If the unsub meant to display the hair,
he was saying something.

30:55.937 --> 30:59.274
-He could've put the hair anywhere.
-Right, no, I get it now. Uh...

30:59.357 --> 31:01.401
Soon as Forensics confirms
it's Beverly's hair--

31:01.484 --> 31:02.527
I'm sorry, what?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.113
Well, we shouldn't jump ahead
of Forensics, am I right?

31:05.196 --> 31:08.658
[Holden] I think, in this case, we have
a dead body missing a chunk of hair,

31:08.741 --> 31:11.828
a big chunk of hair nearby,
so we can go out on a limb and assume--

31:11.911 --> 31:14.414
I think what Agent Ford is trying to say,
in his own way,

31:14.497 --> 31:17.458
is we're behind the eight ball here,
we've come late to the party.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.752
We're gonna have to go over ground
you've covered:

31:19.836 --> 31:21.379
witnesses, crime scene.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.716
We don't mean that as a challenge to you.
It's not any kind of a criticism.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.135
We're just trying to catch up.
Am I right, Agent Ford?

31:30.847 --> 31:31.931
Absolutely.

31:32.015 --> 31:35.268
We may ask some obvious questions
and maybe a few you haven't thought of.

31:35.351 --> 31:38.938
But it's not a contest or a competition.
We're all on the same side.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.357
-Okay?
-Sure.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.401
Let's go through the rest.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.321
I'm curious why you're cutting this guy
so much slack.

31:46.404 --> 31:50.241
He's never seen this kind of thing before.
He's rattled. It's not his fault.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.580
Without a doubt you have more experience,
but why rub it in his face?

31:56.831 --> 31:58.875
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.001
Maybe a little.

32:00.084 --> 32:04.047
The point is, local cops want to catch
their guy as much as we do, maybe more.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.050
For them, it's not just theoretical,
it's where they live.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.519
This is where your focus should be.

32:19.145 --> 32:23.191
Not on the crime scene, not on the corpse,
not on the schematics.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.444
Focus on Beverly.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.947
What did the killer see in her?

32:29.030 --> 32:31.616
We've learned that this is
a crucial detail, and not the only one.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.952
Based on the facts
Detective Ocasek laid out earlier,

32:34.035 --> 32:36.537
our methodology tells us
we're looking for a white male.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.957
These crimes rarely cross racial lines.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.084
He's probably around Beverly's age.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.003
A killer will usually choose someone
smaller and weaker than himself.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.381
He's a loner, hunts at night.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.425
I'm sorry, "hunts"?
Is that a figure of speech?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.177
It is not.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.597
Coroner's report said Beverly
was killed and then butchered.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.974
Isn't that what hunters do?

32:56.808 --> 32:58.810
We're probably looking for a loner.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.063
These men like to explore
the fantasy first,

33:02.605 --> 33:04.732
bondage pornography, hardcore material.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.652
It gives them a certain...
attitude towards women.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.112
Hence, a loner.

33:09.195 --> 33:12.031
Close-knit community like this,
you would've spotted that by now.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.492
I think our man is an outsider,
probably a drifter.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.370
Most likely, he'll move on from here
and kill again.

33:17.453 --> 33:18.788
Again?

33:36.806 --> 33:40.435
The killer thought of Beverly Jean
as just another piece of trash.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.939
Folks loved Beverly Jean.
Trusted her with their kids.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.359
Had to be a drifter, like you say.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.528
[Holden] Some stranger
passing through town.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.363
All that pretty hair caught his eye.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.907
He needed to possess it, then destroy it.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.202
[Tench] You talk to the fiancé?

33:58.286 --> 34:01.122
There's only so much you can get
out of a man in that state.

34:02.081 --> 34:05.460
Benjamin was still in shock.
Gotta take all that into account.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.172
Well, I'm sure you know your people,
but let's just cover our bases.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.550
And let's try to get him cold.
Make some excuse when you call.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.511
Don't mention the FBI, or even the murder.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.597
Help us get an unguarded response.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.682
Soon as Benjamin gets back into town.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.310
-Back into town?
-You let the fiancé leave?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.854
He went up north for a bit
to be with his relatives.

34:24.937 --> 34:27.315
You need to be with family
at times like this.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.151
He'll be back soon. I'll vouch for that.

34:32.945 --> 34:33.988
He'll be back.

34:37.575 --> 34:38.618
[Holden coughs]

34:47.460 --> 34:48.753
Where was the body found?

34:49.212 --> 34:50.546
[Ocasek] Up here to the left.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.847
[Holden] Here's the ironing board.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.561
Right. I'll have a couple of the boys
come pick it up. Sorry about that.

35:05.645 --> 35:09.232
No apology necessary.
We're all learning as we go.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.734
[camera shutter clicks]

35:12.735 --> 35:14.987
You can see why I went easy on the fiancé.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.407
Ugly end for someone you just proposed to.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.951
[Tench] How long were they engaged?

35:20.660 --> 35:21.744
Couple months, I think.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.497
Could be he felt trapped.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.249
By a pretty, young blonde?

35:26.874 --> 35:28.376
Remember what Wendy said?

35:29.252 --> 35:31.170
A colleague of ours, a psychologist.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.841
Events we process as good news
sometimes hit these killers the wrong way.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.717
Huh. That's interesting.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.302
Who found the body?

35:38.886 --> 35:42.181
A welder, Alvin Moran,
out taking his dog for a hike.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.559
-At the dump?
-He have an alibi?

35:45.143 --> 35:48.146
Alibi? He came to us.
Why's he need an alibi?

35:48.229 --> 35:51.315
Sometimes the killer will
insinuate himself into the investigation.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.234
-[Ocasek] Even report his own crime?
-Mm-hmm.

35:53.609 --> 35:54.861
[Holden] Can we talk to him?

35:56.404 --> 35:57.405
Yeah.

36:10.626 --> 36:11.627
Excuse me!

36:13.421 --> 36:14.255
Mr. Moran?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.259
Mr. Moran?

36:25.474 --> 36:27.018
You remember me, Mr. Moran?

36:27.393 --> 36:30.521
These men from the FBI
would like to talk to you. That all right?

36:30.605 --> 36:31.522
Great.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.026
We're told you found Beverly Jean's body.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.361
How'd you happen to find yourself
at the dump?

36:37.820 --> 36:40.281
Hiking. Wopsononock Mountain.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.992
Like to take the trail, clear my head.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.536
-Get a break from the wife and kids?
-[Alvin] That's right.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.331
Get up there a few times a week.
Take the dog for a walk.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.833
[Holden] Still not clear
how that puts you at the dump.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.252
-The path comes in pretty close.
-Does it?

36:53.794 --> 36:56.839
You see any sign of a hiking trail
out by the dump, Bill?

36:56.923 --> 36:59.050
The other side of the railroad tracks,
up the hill.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.928
Looks like a bunch of trees
from where you're standing.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.805
But if there's no clear view
from the dump to the trail...

37:04.889 --> 37:06.390
Are you really FBI?

37:07.558 --> 37:08.726
Am I under suspicion here?

37:12.897 --> 37:13.814
Okay.

37:15.775 --> 37:19.445
So I come off the trail to take a piss,
no law against it.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.948
There may be, actually,
but let's leave that for now.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.992
You go to take a piss,
you see Beverly Jean's body...

37:25.660 --> 37:27.745
I thought it was a store mannequin
or something.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.664
Wouldn't your dog
have gone straight for it?

37:29.747 --> 37:32.124
-Might have, but that's not what happened.
-What kind of dog?

37:32.667 --> 37:35.086
-Retriever.
-And he didn't sniff it out first?

37:35.711 --> 37:36.754
That seems odd.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.674
-He's an old dog.
-Not too old for a hike.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.428
I took care of my business, I collected
my dog, and I went to the police.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.098
Right away? Few hours later? Next day?

37:47.181 --> 37:49.100
Couple hours later. Maybe that night.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.019
It was actually morning
when you came in, sir.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.732
[Holden] Why'd you wait so long
to report the body, Mr. Moran?

37:58.776 --> 38:02.822
You're talking to the FBI, Mr. Moran.
If we want to find something out, we will.

38:05.908 --> 38:08.786
I was scared the cops
might want me for it, okay?

38:09.412 --> 38:12.123
My wife talked me out of that.
I did my duty as a citizen.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.375
You thought they'd want you for a murder?

38:14.834 --> 38:17.461
I seen cops get desperate,
grab whoever they can get.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.629
[Holden] But why you?

38:19.797 --> 38:21.841
I got a bit of a record, all right?

38:22.550 --> 38:26.387
It ain't much. I lit up a few fires
when I was a kid, got into a few fights.

38:26.762 --> 38:27.888
I ain't proud of it.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.473
Came here, met my wife.

38:30.933 --> 38:34.145
-Family man now.
-Before that, did you move around a lot?

38:36.647 --> 38:39.567
[Alvin] Not a good way to live.
I feel settled now.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.529
Is that your statement, Mr. Moran?

38:47.825 --> 38:50.161
I come into town,
grab a beer now and then.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.666
I seen Beverly Jean a few times.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.710
You saw Beverly Jean at a bar?

38:58.586 --> 38:59.503
At The Kettle.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.507
-Finally got up the nerve.
-The nerve to do what?

39:04.592 --> 39:05.843
To buy her a drink.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.014
She wasn't interested, end of story.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.685
Maybe I asked her more than once.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.064
More than once that night at the bar,
or on more than one occasion?

39:18.731 --> 39:21.025
I guess you'd say
on more than one occasion.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.074
-He's too old and too married.
-[Holden] He was a drifter until recently.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.742
Beverly Jean rejected him.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.620
He's got a record.
He tried to help the police.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.207
And his alibi?
Home watching TV with the wife?

39:36.290 --> 39:40.211
If a man like that took Beverly Jean,
he'd draw it out, make her suffer.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.505
You saw the photos,
he must've tortured her for hours.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.007
[Tench] Those wounds were inflicted
posthumously. Can't forget.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.426
You said that before.
What difference does that make?

39:48.803 --> 39:51.138
When you're married, it's a contract.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.724
There's children, a mortgage,

39:53.808 --> 39:56.310
a house to keep up,
almost like a business.

39:57.269 --> 40:00.231
Only you can't quit. She can't fire you.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.024
Stock goes up, stock goes down...

40:02.108 --> 40:03.567
doesn't matter, you're trapped.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.196
Unless you want to bring on the lawyers
and open Pandora's box.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.323
Resentment builds on both sides.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.908
A thousand tiny cuts.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.161
If Alvin Moran had a married man's anger,

40:14.620 --> 40:16.247
he'd have tortured, then killed her.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.416
No question in my mind.

40:20.584 --> 40:23.921
Maybe we should talk to his wife.
See if there's anything there.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.174
I mean, she's the whole alibi.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.970
Wouldn't mind checking it holds up.

40:31.053 --> 40:32.346
[phone ringing]

40:35.558 --> 40:37.601
Mrs. Moran, thank you for coming in.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.938
My name is Bill Tench.
This is my partner, Holden Ford.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.022
Hello.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.735
I don't understand.
I can't call my husband?

40:46.819 --> 40:50.698
-Aren't I supposed to get my phone call?
-You're not under arrest, Mrs. Moran.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.074
These men are from the FBI.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.076
They just want to ask you
a couple questions.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.120
Have you been following the investigation?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.750
Can't look at that. Poor girl.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.463
-Wouldn't hurt a fly.
-You knew her?

41:07.047 --> 41:08.674
Can we ask how you knew her?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.803
-[Moran] She was almost our babysitter.
-Almost?

41:16.098 --> 41:16.932
Mrs. Moran?

41:19.059 --> 41:20.644
We talked with her about it.

41:22.271 --> 41:26.567
When she left,
Alvin wouldn't shut up about the girl.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.235
Meaning?

41:29.445 --> 41:30.571
You know what I mean.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.531
It's best if we don't have to guess,
ma'am.

41:35.659 --> 41:39.163
She was young, and skinny, and...

41:40.414 --> 41:42.333
"Oh, such pretty blonde hair."

41:43.959 --> 41:45.836
Didn't need that in my house.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.380
Not with two little kids in the picture.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.424
What do I look like?

41:51.342 --> 41:55.221
Were you aware that your husband
made overtures to Beverly

41:55.304 --> 41:56.639
on several occasions?

41:56.722 --> 41:59.350
Didn't I just say
he had a thing for the poor girl?

42:02.770 --> 42:04.271
Alvin does this.

42:05.147 --> 42:09.235
It's like sportfishing.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.445
We were told he was home with you
watching television

42:11.529 --> 42:12.863
the night Beverly disappeared.

42:16.408 --> 42:18.202
You think Alvin did this?

42:20.955 --> 42:23.832
Oh! No.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.462
I mean, I'd love for him
to get a good scare,

42:28.546 --> 42:30.631
bothering a girl half his age,

42:30.714 --> 42:32.967
but... no.

42:34.468 --> 42:35.886
The idiot was with me.

42:36.428 --> 42:37.429
The whole night?

42:38.180 --> 42:39.265
The whole night.

42:42.810 --> 42:47.314
[Holden] Okay, her husband made a pass
at a younger woman. He's an idiot.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.567
But so are a million other men.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.819
I don't see any of the anger
you've been talking about.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.904
So lo and behold,
we're back to the fiancé.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.531
Follow your own logic, Bill.

42:55.864 --> 42:58.409
The anger makes no sense
in a young couple either.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.244
This could be the first in a sequence.

43:00.327 --> 43:04.039
Nine times out of ten, it's the boyfriend,
the husband, somebody close.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.749
Nine times isn't every time, Bill.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.834
Listen, uh...

43:08.210 --> 43:10.462
Can't say how much
I appreciate all your help.

43:10.796 --> 43:13.674
Sorry if I got off a little shaky there
at the start.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.594
I'm gonna stick with Alvin,
if it's all the same, keep you posted.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.475
[Carr]  So you're in the middle
of an ongoing investigation?

43:23.559 --> 43:26.020
A local detective asked for our help.
What else could we do?

43:26.103 --> 43:28.522
Tell them you have more important things
to do with your time.

43:28.606 --> 43:32.443
We've been consulting with local cops
for years. No reason to change that now.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.528
My assumption is you're good at your job.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.281
Which means you're gonna be more
focused on solving an actual crime

43:37.364 --> 43:38.991
than the theoretical work we're doing.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.952
-And that's bad?
-[Carr] It's not good or bad.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.413
We can't end crime, no matter what we do.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.750
But in the long run, I think that
our project could have a deeper impact

43:47.833 --> 43:49.376
than solving a single murder.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.545
We can do both. It's not an issue.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.008
What jumped out
when you were talking to Rissell?

43:56.091 --> 43:58.093
He seems aware of the trap
of his childhood.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.971
How things might be different
if he was allowed to stay with his dad.

44:01.055 --> 44:02.139
Kemper said something similar.

44:02.222 --> 44:04.600
They're both playing the victim,
looking for sympathy.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.310
[Holden] I think it's more complicated.

44:06.393 --> 44:09.772
I think you're both right.
I mean, it's self-pity, absolutely.

44:09.855 --> 44:12.733
And the psychopath understands
how that plays to his audience.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.568
-Exactly.
-But the complicated part

44:14.652 --> 44:17.404
is that they actually believe it.
They have to.

44:17.488 --> 44:20.407
I mean, if they admitted
that they rape and murder for pleasure,

44:20.491 --> 44:21.450
it would destroy them.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.535
There's a tension.

44:23.619 --> 44:26.538
They need to be seen
to have power over someone,

44:26.622 --> 44:29.083
and yet circumstance demands
that they erase the only witness,

44:29.166 --> 44:32.086
which means they have to do
the whole thing over again.

44:32.628 --> 44:33.545
It must be hell.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.590
So the self-pity angle works.
You have sympathy for both of them.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.634
Yeah, of course.
How else could I do my job?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.096
Do Kemper and Rissell
have other common traits?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.973
That what you're doing with these cards,
figuring out similarities?

44:45.057 --> 44:47.518
And differences.
I've been going through their files.

44:47.601 --> 44:51.355
I'm trying to frame an overall taxonomy,
except I don't know where to start.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.523
[Tench] The crime scene.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.150
Kemper's like a general,
planning his campaigns.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.653
-But Rissell--
-Didn't intend to kill his first victim.

44:57.736 --> 45:00.614
All of his victims seem spontaneous.
He just walks away when he's done.

45:00.697 --> 45:02.866
Kemper took photographs,
and dissected the victims,

45:02.950 --> 45:04.910
and was very good at hiding the remains.

45:04.993 --> 45:07.830
So could we say "systematic"
and "anti-systematic"?

45:07.913 --> 45:09.623
[Holden] Maybe something a little less...

45:09.706 --> 45:11.917
Something even a beat cop
could understand straight away.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.837
Right.
Like "organized" and "disorganized."

45:14.920 --> 45:16.505
Okay. Let's try it.

45:16.588 --> 45:17.464
What goes where?

45:18.966 --> 45:19.925
Well...

45:20.676 --> 45:24.221
"High intelligence"
would go under "organized."

45:24.596 --> 45:27.057
"Low intelligence": "disorganized."

45:30.644 --> 45:32.563
-What do you think?
-Definitely.

45:32.646 --> 45:36.024
The class is great, but he's obsessed
with the meaning of shit.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.109
Does shit have meaning?

45:37.192 --> 45:38.652
All shit has meaning, man.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.155
Is that her?

45:42.739 --> 45:43.615
[scoffs]

45:44.324 --> 45:46.410
No. Wendy's more...

45:47.786 --> 45:48.620
not that.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.122
Look at you.

45:50.205 --> 45:53.333
Dr. Wendy has you all nervous.
Should I be jealous?

45:53.959 --> 45:56.837
Would I have invited her to go out with us
if I was interested in her?

45:56.920 --> 45:59.089
I've seen men do stranger things.

45:59.548 --> 46:01.967
-So she's married.
-How does that follow?

46:02.050 --> 46:04.595
If you're not interested,
she must be married.

46:05.053 --> 46:09.057
For a man who picks up strange women
in bars, you have your scruples.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.226
Thank you.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.147
I don't think she is married.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.065
That's her.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.028
[laughs] No.

46:22.654 --> 46:24.114
Do you plan on getting married?

46:24.198 --> 46:26.033
Having kids, the whole thing?

46:27.367 --> 46:29.703
Are you proposing, Holden Ford?

46:29.786 --> 46:30.871
Just curious.

46:32.456 --> 46:35.584
-Your parents have a good marriage?
-I have no idea.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.128
-Where's this coming from?
-The study.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.631
We're talking a lot about parents.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.508
Harsh mothers, absent fathers.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.551
All fathers are absent fathers.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.930
That's definitely her.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.683
-No.
-[laughs]

46:51.767 --> 46:52.601
Hello.

46:53.810 --> 46:54.770
Hi.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.814
-Wendy Carr.
-Deborah Mitford.

46:57.898 --> 46:59.024
It's a pleasure.

46:59.107 --> 47:02.277
Thank you so much for the invitation.
It was unexpected, but appreciated.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.447
Yeah, for a fed, he's not so bad
at having a good time.

47:05.822 --> 47:07.407
Are you in law enforcement also?

47:07.491 --> 47:09.660
No, I'm doing postgrad, actually.

47:09.743 --> 47:12.120
-Sociology at UVA.
-What's your concentration?

47:12.204 --> 47:14.498
-[Debbie] Social deviance.
-So... Durkheim?

47:14.581 --> 47:16.542
-Yes.
-Oh, God.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.961
Because I didn't know who Durkheim was...

47:19.044 --> 47:21.672
-Or Goring, or Blumer.
-It's fine.

47:22.172 --> 47:25.092
I'm not intimidated being around women
who are smarter than me.

47:25.759 --> 47:28.178
Men often say that,
but they rarely mean it.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.346
[Debbie] Holden means it.

47:29.429 --> 47:32.933
He has a lot of flaws,
but surprisingly, that's not one of them.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.646
-I'm-- Excuse me.
-Yes.

47:38.438 --> 47:41.316
Could I get a Manhattan?
And will you have another round?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.360
-Yeah, thank you.
-Yeah.

47:44.695 --> 47:45.988
[Carr] So he called you directly?

47:46.071 --> 47:49.366
No, Andrea called.
Said he wanted to meet with us.

47:49.449 --> 47:51.118
Any idea what this is about?

47:51.201 --> 47:54.371
No. Usually, it's about finding clarity.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.498
But he asked for me specifically?

47:56.582 --> 47:57.749
All three of us.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.147
[Shepard] Come in.

48:22.316 --> 48:26.194
Dr. Carr, Unit Chief Shepard.
Nice to meet you finally.

48:26.278 --> 48:27.279
[Carr] You as well.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.073
[Shepard] Sit, please. All of you.

48:32.242 --> 48:35.579
So, how's everything? Progressing?

48:37.581 --> 48:38.957
Uh, yes, thank you.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.584
-Fine, thanks.
-Slowly, but yes.

48:40.667 --> 48:41.793
Can I help with anything?

48:45.464 --> 48:47.299
Is there anything I need to know?

48:49.968 --> 48:52.554
-Sir, if this is about the car--
-Nobody cares about the car.

48:52.638 --> 48:55.599
It was insured and I assume driven
by your protégé.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.352
-It's not important who was driving.
-[Shepard] I agree.

48:58.435 --> 49:01.938
Dr. Carr, I'm aware of your consulting
with Bill over the years

49:02.022 --> 49:05.525
and your help framing certain
psychological concepts with the BSU.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.195
Uh, yes, a handful of times.
Special Agent Tench was--

49:08.278 --> 49:11.865
I assume that meant you understood
how things were done here at Quantico.

49:11.948 --> 49:14.284
I assumed the same for your cohorts.

49:15.661 --> 49:18.205
You might think it is my job
to impede your progress

49:18.288 --> 49:22.084
with my insistence on timelines
and established protocols.

49:22.167 --> 49:24.044
-No, sir. Not at all.
-That is not my job.

49:24.127 --> 49:27.297
My job is to provide guidance
and quite a bit of protection.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.966
-I don't understand.
-Clearly.

49:32.135 --> 49:34.471
You have stepped
outside the shade of my umbrella

49:34.554 --> 49:36.848
and you are now exposed
to direct sunlight.

49:37.307 --> 49:39.685
I applied for grant money
from several sources

49:39.768 --> 49:41.728
anticipating a response months from now.

49:41.812 --> 49:42.813
Much to my surprise,

49:42.896 --> 49:46.066
the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration was already aware

49:46.149 --> 49:47.317
of our needs and activities.

49:47.401 --> 49:50.529
I see. I had no intention
of embarrassing you, Unit Chief Shepard.

49:50.612 --> 49:53.532
I was at a fund-raiser for the university
and I was talking to some--

49:53.615 --> 49:55.450
Yes, talking to people outside the FBI

49:55.534 --> 49:58.286
about something
you were not even supposed to be aware of.

49:58.370 --> 50:01.957
The LEAA explained
that the application was anticipated.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.667
How could that be, I wondered.

50:04.626 --> 50:07.671
It seems they know more
about what's going on in our basement

50:07.754 --> 50:10.215
than I was comfortable including
in the application.

50:10.298 --> 50:13.260
-I so apologize. It--
-Sir, this is my fault.

50:13.343 --> 50:15.512
Your research has been awarded $200,000.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.141
-What?
-[Shepard] There's more.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.435
As I said, I applied to more
than one place for funding.

50:21.518 --> 50:24.354
The National Institute of Justice
heard about the LEAA,

50:24.438 --> 50:25.647
and they are in competition,

50:25.731 --> 50:29.943
so the NIJ has awarded you
an additional $185,000.

50:30.026 --> 50:30.861
You can't be serious.

50:30.944 --> 50:33.822
This amount of money
comes with considerable scrutiny.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.907
And I'm not talking about bookkeeping,

50:35.991 --> 50:38.952
although you will certainly be required
to keep meticulous records.

50:39.035 --> 50:43.623
I'm talking about Congress having
a real interest in everything we do.

50:43.707 --> 50:47.419
So much for the protection
I might have afforded you.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.380
Congratulations, I suppose.

50:51.757 --> 50:53.091
Have a nice day.
