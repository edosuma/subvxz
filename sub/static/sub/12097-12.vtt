08:44.090 --> 08:46.592
I killed him, I killed him.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.096
I was standing on him.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.597
Where you going?

08:52.598 --> 08:54.099
To the outhouse.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.603
If I can kill a spider,
I can handle the outhouse.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.610
"Into the mystifying oracles..."

09:06.612 --> 09:08.113
Oh, Benson, good.
Sit down a minute.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.114
Why?

09:09.115 --> 09:11.616
I want you to work this with me.
What is it?

09:11.617 --> 09:14.619
It's a Ouija Board.
It tells the future.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.621
Get out of here.

09:17.623 --> 09:21.126
No, Benson, come on, now.
Just for a second.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.127
What does it do?

09:22.128 --> 09:23.628
Well, first of all,

09:23.629 --> 09:25.630
we have to put
our fingers on it.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.133
Oh, no, not like that.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.634
Gently, like this.

09:29.635 --> 09:32.137
See?

09:32.138 --> 09:33.638
Now, I ask it questions,

09:33.639 --> 09:35.640
and it spells out the answers.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.143
You paid money for this?

09:40.146 --> 09:41.146
Ready?
Yeah.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.148
Now?
Yeah.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.150
[SHOUTING] What is Benson

09:45.151 --> 09:47.652
going to cook for dinner?

09:47.653 --> 09:49.654
You could've just asked me

09:49.655 --> 09:52.157
instead of
spending money on this.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.159
Nothing's happening.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.162
I guess I ain't cooking.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.165
Give it a minute.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.666
Forget it.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.169
It probably don't move
for black people.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.672
Hi. I let myself in.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.674
Good, now you can let
yourself out.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.176
Oh, Benson,
can I get something to drink?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.177
No.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.678
Oh, good, thank you.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.681
I'd probably spill it.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.184
Detective Donohue,

10:19.185 --> 10:20.685
I have a surprise for you.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.187
And I have a surprise for you.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.188
I found a bandage

10:23.189 --> 10:24.189
that probably belonged
to your husband

10:24.190 --> 10:25.190
at the train station.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.192
I think he's headed
toward New York.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.195
Oh, let's ask the Ouija Board.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.196
It'll tell us.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.197
Ouija Board?

10:32.198 --> 10:34.199
Mm-hmm.
That's my surprise.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.701
No kidding?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.704
Well, that's sure gonna save me
a lot of work.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.706
Now I can conduct
the entire investigation

10:41.707 --> 10:42.707
from the kitchen.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.709
You don't believe in it, do you?

10:44.710 --> 10:45.710
No.

10:45.711 --> 10:46.711
Well, do you think

10:46.712 --> 10:48.213
that you'll find Chester?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.715
Well, I've found everyone
I've ever looked for,

10:50.716 --> 10:51.716
except for one person.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.218
Who?

10:53.219 --> 10:54.219
My ex-wife.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.221
What happened to her?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.722
She ran off with my partner.

10:57.723 --> 10:58.723
No...

10:58.724 --> 11:01.226
We owned a detective agency
together, he and I,

11:01.227 --> 11:02.727
for 10 years.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.230
Then one day,
he and my wife disappeared,

11:05.231 --> 11:07.732
along with most of our earnings.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.235
See, he was screwing around
with the books too.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.240
You never found them?

11:15.241 --> 11:16.241
Nah, I never looked.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.742
See, in the beginning,

11:17.743 --> 11:20.245
I was so hurt,
I couldn't bring myself to,

11:20.246 --> 11:21.246
and after a while,

11:21.247 --> 11:22.747
I was so angry,
I didn't want to.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.249
How terrible.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.251
Nah, it's okay, it's fine.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.754
The house is quiet.
There's no hair in the sink.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.756
Well, don't you worry.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.758
Someday, you'll find someone.

11:33.759 --> 11:34.759
I already have.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.761
Oh, see that?
Isn't that nice?

11:36.762 --> 11:38.763
It stinks. I hate it.

11:38.764 --> 11:41.266
I wish I'd never met her.
I'm a wreck.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.267
If that woman knew

11:42.268 --> 11:44.269
what she was doing to me...

11:44.270 --> 11:46.271
You mean, she doesn't know?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.272
Of course not.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.274
Well, you'll have to tell her

11:49.275 --> 11:50.275
how you feel.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.276
I can't tell her how I feel.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.777
Oh, of course you can.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.778
No, I can't.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.280
You just tell her.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.281
I love you.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.282
You see?

11:57.283 --> 11:59.284
Yes, just say it out, like that.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.286
She'll love hearing it.
Believe me.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.287
I love you.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.290
Good, goodie.
It sounds good, huh?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.293
You, I love you.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.302
Me?

12:17.303 --> 12:18.303
See what I mean?

12:18.304 --> 12:19.804
Sorry, I knew I shouldn't
have said it.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.306
You forced me.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.307
I'm leaving. Goodbye.
Where's the door?

12:22.308 --> 12:24.309
Me?
You.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.310
No.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.312
Yes.
Really?

12:27.313 --> 12:28.813
What do you think?

12:28.814 --> 12:30.315
I'd make something like that up?

12:30.316 --> 12:32.817
Ooh... this is terrible.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.319
Well, I don't know
how terrible it is.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
I'm not that bad.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.821
Oh, no, I don't mean that,

12:36.822 --> 12:40.325
but if you feel the way
you say you feel,

12:40.326 --> 12:42.827
how hard are you going to look
for Chester?

12:42.828 --> 12:43.828
Very hard.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.831
I'd rather compete with the man
than with the memory.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.832
Don't worry, Mrs. Tate.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.834
I promise,
you'll get your husband,

12:49.835 --> 12:52.337
and then...

12:52.338 --> 12:53.839
I'll get you.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.356
Nervous, huh?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.857
Well, I...

13:12.858 --> 13:14.359
Don't be. It's the happiest day
of your life.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.860
Remember that.
Yeah, I know...

13:15.861 --> 13:17.362
It was the happiest day
of my life once.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.364
It's the happiest day
of your mother's life right now.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.365
That true, Mary?

13:20.366 --> 13:21.366
[SOBS]

13:21.367 --> 13:23.868
You see? So don't be nervous.

13:23.869 --> 13:24.869
You nervous?
A little.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.872
Don't be. It's the happiest day
of your life.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.873
You nervous, Burt?

13:28.874 --> 13:30.375
No, I've been through this
all before.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.876
Yeah, I'm pretty nervous.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.378
Don't you be nervous,

13:33.379 --> 13:34.379
because you're marrying
a wonderful girl,

13:34.380 --> 13:35.880
and the entire family's
crazy about her, so...

13:35.881 --> 13:36.881
Isn't that true, Mary?

13:36.882 --> 13:38.883
[SOBS]

13:38.884 --> 13:40.445
See what I mean?
We're all tickled pink.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.891
Oh, Ma, Ma, you all right?

13:46.892 --> 13:47.892
Oh, great.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.894
Is that happy crying
or unhappy crying?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.396
You know, I've never
been able to tell

13:51.397 --> 13:52.897
the difference.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.399
Yes.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.400
Yes?

13:55.401 --> 13:56.901
It's both.

13:56.902 --> 13:57.902
I'm happy

13:57.903 --> 13:58.903
because you're getting married,
Jodie,

13:58.904 --> 14:01.906
but... I'm losing my baby.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.908
Ma, you're not losing me.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.410
I'm right here.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.411
You'll move out.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.412
I'll never see you.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.915
Ma, I moved out months ago...

14:12.418 --> 14:13.418
And you still see me.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.421
I mean, today's
a perfect example.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.423
Look this way.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.426
What do you see?

14:21.427 --> 14:22.427
You.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.929
See?

14:25.931 --> 14:27.432
[MUMBLING]

14:27.433 --> 14:29.434
Just let me explain
something to you now.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.936
Now, you know I'm not very big
on father-son lectures, right?

14:31.937 --> 14:34.439
But women are different
than men.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.444
I suppose you understand that
more than anybody,

14:39.445 --> 14:41.405
having dealt with it
from both sides, so to speak.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.449
No, I mean up here,

14:44.450 --> 14:46.451
you know,
it's up here they're different.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.952
For instance, sometimes,
if you're nice to them,

14:47.953 --> 14:49.454
right away, they get suspicious,

14:49.455 --> 14:50.955
and then
if you treat them rotten,

14:50.956 --> 14:51.956
they think
they did something wrong,

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
and they feel great, you see?

14:53.459 --> 14:54.959
That is one of
the more ridiculous things

14:54.960 --> 14:56.461
I've ever heard.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.463
Please, Mary, I know
what I'm talking about here.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.464
They contradict a lot too.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.965
You say, "blue."
They say, "green."

15:00.966 --> 15:01.966
Totally untrue.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.468
See that?

15:03.469 --> 15:04.469
Okay, that's it.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.472
See you out there, Jodie.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.975
Thanks, Burt.

15:11.477 --> 15:16.481
Uh... you know, Ma,
I am a little nervous.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.983
I know.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.988
I hope I'm doing
the right thing.

15:24.990 --> 15:28.493
I think you're going to make
a terrific married person.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.998
Ah, there you are.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
Everything okay?

15:35.501 --> 15:38.002
No, Aunt Jessie
just sewed herself to Carol.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.004
Do you think maybe you could go
and undo them?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.006
Yes.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.508
I'll see you later.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.010
Yeah.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.521
Hey, you son of a gun, you.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.522
Hey.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.523
You nervous?
Yeah, a little.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.024
Well, don't be,

16:00.025 --> 16:02.527
because today is
the happiest day of your life.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.030
I heard.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.032
You sure you're holding up okay?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.534
Yeah.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.536
How about you?

16:11.537 --> 16:13.538
Okay, okay.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.039
There's not much left to do

16:15.040 --> 16:16.541
except follow instructions

16:16.542 --> 16:19.043
and wait.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.546
You know, Danny, you didn't
have to come here today.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.047
I would've understood.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.550
Hey, look,
we could all use a happy time

16:25.551 --> 16:26.551
right about now.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.552
I'm glad.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.053
Hey, listen,

16:29.054 --> 16:30.555
I'm not really big

16:30.556 --> 16:31.556
on giving brotherly advice,

16:31.557 --> 16:32.557
but...

16:32.558 --> 16:33.558
I have found

16:33.559 --> 16:35.059
from personal experience

16:35.060 --> 16:37.061
that if you treat a woman

16:37.062 --> 16:38.563
in a certain way,

16:38.564 --> 16:40.565
she'll respond in a certain way,

16:40.566 --> 16:43.568
so whatever you do,

16:43.569 --> 16:46.071
always treat Carol
in a certain way.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.576
Thanks, Danny.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.579
It'll pay off for you
in the end.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.580
It's good to know.

16:55.581 --> 16:59.584
Gee, isn't it something?

16:59.585 --> 17:00.585
I'm married.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.086
You're getting married.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.087
Remember when all we used

17:03.088 --> 17:04.589
to think about

17:04.589 --> 17:05.589
was whether Susie Spivak's...

17:05.590 --> 17:08.092
were real or not?

17:08.093 --> 17:09.594
They were.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.101
Ah, life was so simple then.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.604
Everything was so easy.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.606
At 6,
you were gonna be a fireman,

17:21.607 --> 17:24.608
and I was gonna be a dog.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.612
That's right,

17:27.613 --> 17:28.613
Big Alfred, the collie,

17:28.614 --> 17:31.616
who lived down the block.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.117
And then a year later,

17:33.118 --> 17:34.619
I was gonna be the president,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.621

Mickey Mantle's job

17:37.623 --> 17:39.624

five years of my life

Hi, Billy.

Good luck.
Thanks.

a thing like that?

You won't have an extra ticket.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.188
