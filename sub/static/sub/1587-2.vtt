WEBVTT

01:53.680 --> 01:54.681
Tansy!

01:54.800 --> 01:57.326
Tansy!

01:57.400 --> 02:00.244
Tansy!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.284
Tansy!

02:19.360 --> 02:21.010
There you are.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.924
I can't see her. Tansy!

02:31.240 --> 02:32.571
Tansy!

02:34.880 --> 02:38.407
If you make it out of the woods, you win!

02:38.880 --> 02:40.564
Run, Tansy!

02:49.520 --> 02:52.524
- Tansy!
- Where is she?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.568
Tansy!

03:16.840 --> 03:20.367
Good girls. Down.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.208
Well done. You, too.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.090
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.881
A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?

03:28.960 --> 03:31.486
- A fine shot, master. My lady.
- Please, my lord.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.922
- It hurts. Please.
- Sweet. Don't cry.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.085
It will be over soon.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.368
She thinks she's pretty.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.646
Let me put one through her face.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.370
We have to
reward the hounds, love.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.605
- They did all the hard work.
- Why? I did whatever you asked.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.603
But you made Myranda feel jealous.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.763
- Me, jealous of her?
- My lord, please.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.645
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.928
Rip her!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.684
Rip her!

04:06.440 --> 04:08.727
Not so pretty now.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.251
Your new hand,
it's nicer than the old one.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.567
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.006
- Is it solid gold?
- Gilded steel.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.042
You're not eating. Why is no one eating?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.521
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.491
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand, not a stomach.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.441
Try the boar.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.127
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.925
A toast.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.446
To the proud Lannister children.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.608
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.846
- I'll clean it up.
- No, I'll do it. Leave us.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.923
It's only wine.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.085
I can't fight any more.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.721
What about your left?

05:17.760 --> 05:21.082
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.604
How can I protect the King
when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.131
You're the Lord Commander now.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.451
Command. Let others do the fighting.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.444
When was the last time Father used a sword?

05:33.560 --> 05:35.608
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.127
When people find out I
can't slay a pigeon...

05:38.200 --> 05:39.247
Train, then.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.881
- Learn to fight with your other hand.
- With whom? You?

05:43.320 --> 05:44.606
Men talk.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.002
As soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.726
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.642
I have just the one.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.931
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.401
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.121
He tells me you shit gold,
just like your father.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.164
Is this place safe?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.241
There's this knight, Leygood.
Got thunderbolts on his shield.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.361
Uh-huh.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.240
Right here is where I fuck his wife.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.562
She's a screamer, that one.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.802
If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.247
I've never seen Valyrian steel
before. She's a beauty.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.250
Problem is,

06:39.320 --> 06:42.210
if you fight with an edged
blade, I'll have to.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.882
And if I fight with an edged blade,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.803
I'll have no one left to pay me.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.682
I haven't used a sparring sword
since I was nine.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.526
Mmm-mmm.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.051
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.121
Best time to attack a man.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.164
Mind yourself.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.807
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.491
Come on, then.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.486
Open the gates!

07:43.680 --> 07:45.444
Riders coming in!

08:01.680 --> 08:04.160
Let's get these horses seen to!

08:06.880 --> 08:08.882
Father. Welcome home.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.610
Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.249
A pleasure, Mother.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.921
Hello.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.571
See that the horses are fed,
watered, and rubbed down.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.120
And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.847
This way, my lady.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.969
Where is your prize?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.480
With the hounds.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.609
I'll have a look at him.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.126
I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.044
Word travels. How he screamed.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.122
You would have loved it.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.325
Father.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.930
What did you do to him?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.206
I trained him.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.045
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.045
- You flayed him.
- Peeled a few bits.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.844
Removed a few others.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.081
This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.084
We've been flaying our enemies
for 1,000 years.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.685
The flayed man is on our banners.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.683
My banners, not yours.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.330
You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.761
Tywin Lannister has given me the North.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.207
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.964
As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,

09:42.440 --> 09:44.283
our armies are trapped south of the Neck.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.730
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.166
I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.010
I already asked.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.487
Lord Greyjoy refused.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.681
Savages have no...

09:56.760 --> 09:59.650
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.688
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.961
I acted.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.882
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands,
thanks to the Greyjoys.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.407
I needed Theon whole.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.282
Theon was our enemy.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.361
But Reek

10:23.760 --> 10:25.842
will never betray us.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.521
I placed far too much trust in you.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.441
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

10:42.840 --> 10:45.844
- It's disrespectful.
- Sorry, my lord.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.882
Give him the razor.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.203
I'm not a Bolton, Father.
What does it matter?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.045
Go on, Reek.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.441
A nice close shave.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.807
Reek,

11:36.120 --> 11:37.645
tell Father,

11:38.280 --> 11:40.601
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.281
I don't know, my lord.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.126
You murdered them

11:45.480 --> 11:48.290
and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.840
Reek,

11:51.640 --> 11:54.211
did you murder the Stark boys?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.009
No, my lord.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.206
Just two farm boys.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.963
And crisped them
so no one would know?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.883
Yes, my lord.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.088
The Starks have always ruled the North.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.208
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

12:10.280 --> 12:12.647
the country will rally to their side,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.241
now that Robb Stark is gone.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.290
Oh, that's right, Reek.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.330
Robb Stark is dead.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.886
Sorry.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.404
I know he was like a brother to you.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.207
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.768
How do you feel about that?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.528
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.002
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.081
Your pet rat have any thoughts
on which way they went after Winterfell?

13:02.680 --> 13:04.330
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.843
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.809
Their bastard brother.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.644
He could be sheltering them.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.960
He may know where they are.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.646
Even if he doesn't, he's
half Stark himself.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.767
Could be a threat.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.122
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.731
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.766
Bring this creature of yours.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.242
Maybe he'll be of some use.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.403
Take the Moat for the
family, for our family,

13:37.640 --> 13:40.041
and I'll reconsider your position.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.444
Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the King?

13:46.520 --> 13:49.888
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.047
Oh, to be foreign.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.724
Shae has been noticed.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.009
Sansa's maid saw you with her.
She already told your sister.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.890
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.531
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.047
My father will ask you if there's anything
more, and you'll tell him some clever lie.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.009
No, I will not.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.845
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

14:11.920 --> 14:14.321
if they suspected me of lying?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.846
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.962
No legendary brother to avenge me.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.567
Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.529
Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.922
No one weeps for spiders, or whores.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.241
I have friends across the sea
who could help her.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.685
She won't leave.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.282
I've told her this is a dangerous place
so many times, she no longer believes it.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.569
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.883
Have you ever known your father
to make an idle threat?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.167
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

14:46.720 --> 14:50.327
Your Grace, it is my honour
to present you with this wedding cup.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.761
May you and my daughter Margaery
drink deep and live long.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.642
A handsome goblet, my lord.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.722
Or shall I call you Father?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.002
I should be honoured, Your Grace.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.161
She's the whore I told you about.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.844
The dark-haired one.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.928
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.001
Hmm.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.400
A book?

15:30.480 --> 15:31.686
The Lives of Four Kings.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.446
Grand Maester Kaeth's history of
the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,

15:35.800 --> 15:37.040
Baelor the Blessed,

15:37.440 --> 15:39.568
Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.365
A book every king should read.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.530
Now that the war is won,

15:53.120 --> 15:56.329
we should all find time for wisdom.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.884
Thank you, Uncle.

16:10.640 --> 16:15.202
One of only two Valyrian steel swords
in the capital, Your Grace,

16:15.280 --> 16:17.601
freshly forged in your honour.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.929
Careful, Your Grace.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.241
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.368
So they say.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.840
Such a great sword should have a name.
What shall I call her?

16:51.920 --> 16:52.967
Stormbringer.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.209
- Terminus.
- Widow's Wail.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.647
- Wolfsbane.
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.167
Every time I use it,

17:01.240 --> 17:03.607
it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head
all over again.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.406
Don't.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.890
You want me on the desk?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.684
- What's wrong, my lion?
- Don't call me that.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.320
What should I call you?

17:46.520 --> 17:49.330
I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.210
Our friendship?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.488
There's a ship waiting in the harbour
bound for Pentos.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.001
What?

17:56.080 --> 17:57.491
You'll have your own cabin,

17:57.880 --> 18:01.851
and across the Narrow
Sea a house, servants.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.530
- What is this?
- I'm a married man.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.847
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.801
I don't want her to suffer any more
on my account.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.166
I need to uphold my vows.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.004
She doesn't want you.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.367
- I need to do right by her.
- You don't want her.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.124
By our children.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.601
What are you afraid of?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.330
- I'm not afraid.
- You are.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.042
You are afraid of your
father and your sister.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.646
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.609
I'm not afraid of them.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.489
- I'm not going to run from them.
- Shae.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.408
We will fight them together. It's like
you said, I am yours and you are mine.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.845
You're a whore!

18:44.880 --> 18:47.804
Sansa is fit to bear my children,
and you are not.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.322
I can't be in love with a whore.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.649
I can't have children with a whore.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.725
How many men have you been with?
500? 5,000?

19:03.840 --> 19:05.968
How many whores have you been with?

19:06.080 --> 19:08.162
I have enjoyed my time with all of them,

19:08.240 --> 19:10.402
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.528
But now that time is over.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.604
You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.247
Bronn will escort you to your ship.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.406
Hear us now.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.131
Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord,

20:07.600 --> 20:09.045
and lead us from the darkness.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.570
Sire, I served you well.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.881
Lord of Light, show us the way.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.843
- Lead us from the darkness.
- Selyse, you're my sister!

20:20.920 --> 20:23.571
- Yours are the stars that guide us.
- Tell him!

20:23.640 --> 20:26.450
- Tell him!
- Lord of Light, protect us,

20:26.520 --> 20:28.966
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.481
Did you see? Their souls.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.442
It was their souls.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.444
Our lord took them. Did you see?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.850
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.722
He was an infidel.

21:01.800 --> 21:06.044
He worshipped the gods of his
fathers and their fathers before him.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.731
They were the gods of your fathers, too.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.168
I ordered him to tear down his idols.
He disobeyed.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.687
How many ships did he bring to your cause?
How many men?

21:15.760 --> 21:17.967
A good deal more than you.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.602
Did you see, Ser Davos?

21:21.680 --> 21:25.571
They're with our lord now.
Their sins all burned away.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.921
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, My Queen.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.006
Meat's off.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.643
Our larders are almost empty.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.848
Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.604
You hate fish.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.207
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.927
When Storm's End was under siege
and I was starving,

22:00.320 --> 22:04.041
Stannis boiled soup for me from books.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.247
The binding glue is made from horses.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.688
One morning,
he shot two seagulls on the beach.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.525
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.410
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.125
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

22:28.240 --> 22:30.083
That's all I knew when I was a child.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.725
Until you found the Lord of Light?

22:32.120 --> 22:34.202
Until he found me.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.364
I fear for our daughter's soul.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.202
Every mother
should fear for her child's soul.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.248
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.485
You barely know her.

22:51.680 --> 22:54.286
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.727
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.641
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.206
She needs the rod.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.602
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.641
As you command.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.651
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.526
Come in.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.361
Were you sleeping, Princess?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.128
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

23:33.560 --> 23:34.607
I heard it.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.161
And it frightened you?

23:37.840 --> 23:39.205
Ser Axell was my uncle.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.444
He was always kind to me.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.443
They're in a better place now, Princess.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.000
The fire cleansed them
of the sins of the world.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.809
But they screamed.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.326
Women scream when they give birth.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.448
Afterward they are filled with joy.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.284
Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.362
You have so many questions, don't you?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.525
So did I when I was a child.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.042
I was much like you.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.524
Only I wasn't a princess.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.205
And you didn't have this.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.481
No.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.364
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl,
believe me.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.491
What do you know of the gods?

24:13.320 --> 24:14.731
I read The Seven-Pointed Star.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.609
Lies and fables.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.362
Septons speak of seven gods.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.124
There are but two.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.521
A god of light and love and joy,

24:24.960 --> 24:28.601
and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.091
Eternally at war.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.888
Then there are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

24:35.080 --> 24:38.687
There's only one hell, Princess.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.842
The one we live in now.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.641
Hodor.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.647
Why did you wake me?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.609
You've been gone for hours.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.005
I was hungry.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.326
We're all hungry.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.121
I was just eating.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.363
Summer was eating.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.970
Your body can't live on the food
your wolf consumes.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.489
Spending too much time in Summer's skin
is dangerous.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.483
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.005
Must be glorious, though.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.526
To run, to leap, to hunt.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.244
To be whole.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.084
I know it's tempting,

25:59.560 --> 26:03.167
but if you're trapped in Summer for too long,
you'll forget what it was to be human.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.768
You'd forget us, Bran.

26:09.880 --> 26:15.125
You'd forget your mother and father,
your brothers and sisters, Winterfell.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.126
You'd forget you.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.121
And if we lose you, we lose everything.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.203
Hodor, take me to the tree.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.003
Look for me

27:51.760 --> 27:53.091
beneath the tree.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.401
He saw us!

28:03.440 --> 28:04.441
North.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.721
I know where we have to go.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.850
Let it be known that
Margaery of House Tyrell

29:07.160 --> 29:10.881
and Joffrey of the Houses
Lannister and Baratheon

29:10.960 --> 29:14.601
are one heart, one flesh, one soul.

29:15.960 --> 29:20.124
Cursed be he
who would seek to tear them asunder.

29:22.840 --> 29:27.084
With this kiss, I pledge my love.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.642
We have a new queen.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.210
Better her than you.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.320
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.483
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.047
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

30:15.120 --> 30:16.565
tend not to have it for long.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.087
You ought to try enjoying something
before you die.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.889
You might find it suits you.

30:21.960 --> 30:25.169
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.481
Anyway, I don't know
what you're complaining about.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.607
I'm paying my share.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.526
Shall we stick golden roses
on half the meat pies

30:31.640 --> 30:33.244
to commemorate your generosity?

30:33.320 --> 30:37.006
No, your heartfelt "Thank you"
is its own reward.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.811
I would imagine
I'll be hearing it again before long.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.167
Wars are rather expensive.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.210
"The Iron Bank will have its due."

30:45.320 --> 30:47.721
How they love to remind everyone.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.451
Almost as much as
you Lannisters with your debts.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.488
I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.164
We both know you're smarter than that.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.451
Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.050
All taken care of.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.283
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.805
And you saw the ship sail away?

31:18.640 --> 31:21.644
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.245
How do you know?

31:23.360 --> 31:25.840
Because if someone follows me
without an invitation,

31:25.920 --> 31:27.729
I'm the last person they ever follow.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.643
Was someone following you?

31:31.480 --> 31:32.481
She's gone.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.488
I know you don't want to
believe it, but she is.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.922
Now, go drink until it feels like
you did the right thing.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.486
Hello.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.009
- Hello.
- Not you.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.731
You look exquisite, child.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.371
The wind has been at you, though.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.691
I haven't had the opportunity to tell you

32:14.760 --> 32:17.491
how sorry I was to hear about your brother.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.850
War is war, but killing a man at a wedding,

32:21.400 --> 32:22.731
horrid.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.723
What sort of monster would do such a thing?

32:25.280 --> 32:28.284
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.600
My lady.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.127
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.770
Perhaps if your pauper husband

32:34.840 --> 32:37.650
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

32:37.720 --> 32:40.451
he might be able to afford to bring you
to Highgarden for a visit.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.649
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

32:43.800 --> 32:45.802
it would do you good to see some of it.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.849
You must excuse me. It's time I
ate some of this food I paid for.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.329
A coat of gold

32:57.400 --> 32:59.721
A coat of red

33:00.520 --> 33:06.084
A lion still has claws

33:06.520 --> 33:08.648
And mine are long...

33:09.120 --> 33:11.088
Very good. Off you go.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.967
My love,
why don't we make the announcement?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.604
Everyone.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.921
The Queen would like to say a few words.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.047
We are so fortunate
to enjoy this marvellous food and drink.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.442
Not all among us are so lucky.

33:52.880 --> 33:56.680
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

33:57.120 --> 34:01.091
King Joffrey has decreed that
the leftovers from our feast

34:01.160 --> 34:03.845
be given to the poorest in his city.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.489
You're an example to us all.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.010
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.411
Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.846
Your sister looks very beautiful.

34:42.719 --> 34:43.926
As does yours.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.568
So, are you looking
forward to your wedding?

34:47.639 --> 34:49.244
Yes, very much.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.125
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.204
- They certainly are.
- Perhaps they should get married.

34:57.080 --> 35:00.846
If you were to marry Cersei,
she'd murder you in your sleep.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.921
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

35:05.040 --> 35:08.761
she'd murder him, too,
long before he drew his first breath.

35:08.840 --> 35:13.880
Luckily for you, none of this will happen
because you'll never marry her.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.881
And neither will you.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.929
Your Grace. My King.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.804
- My Queen.
- Lady Brienne.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.131
So good of you to come.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.651
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.721
Did you just bow?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.129
Apologies, Your Grace.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.770
I never did master the curtsy.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.922
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

35:49.240 --> 35:52.483
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.766
A shame.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.201
I'd knight the man that put an end to
that deviant's life.

35:57.800 --> 36:01.009
I just wanted to congratulate you both
and wish you good fortune.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.401
The country has been at war too long.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.366
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.090
- Yes.
- Thank you.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.208
I hope we see more of you.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.170
Lady Brienne.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.487
You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.006
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.363
As you say, Your Grace.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.771
I owe you my gratitude.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.047
You returned my brother safely
to King's Landing.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.531
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.681
More than once.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.125
Did he?

36:41.120 --> 36:42.451
Haven't heard that story before.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.722
Not such a fascinating story.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.280
I'm sure you have many.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.361
Sworn to Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark,
and now my brother.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.883
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next,

36:57.280 --> 36:59.567
serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.246
I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.291
But you love him.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.170
Your Grace.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.846
No, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.161
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.568
This young lady sought my advice...

37:33.720 --> 37:35.290
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.409
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.569
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.808
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

37:43.880 --> 37:46.326
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.529
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.409
What do you think I could do to you?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.608
I never meant to annoy anyone.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.445
But you are. You're annoying me right now.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.727
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.610
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.170
Leave this wedding right now.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.083
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that

38:05.160 --> 38:08.369
all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.602
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

38:10.760 --> 38:15.766
The Queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

38:15.880 --> 38:17.370
or you will.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.405
A gold dragon to
whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.407
You're in rather a good mood.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.884
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.804
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.245
Prince Oberyn.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.731
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.564
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,

39:03.640 --> 39:06.086
and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.731
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

39:08.920 --> 39:12.163
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

39:12.680 --> 39:16.082
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.043
Charmed.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.963
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.885
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.361
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

39:30.440 --> 39:32.841
- We don't despise them in Dorne.
- No? How tolerant of you.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.801
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.970
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.281
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.041
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.528
Please give him our regards.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.843
With any luck, the gout will abate with
time and he will be able to walk again.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.888
They call it the rich man's disease.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.166
A wonder you don't have it.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.890
Noblemen in my part of the country

39:55.960 --> 39:59.248
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.084
People everywhere have their differences.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.527
In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.528
In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

40:07.600 --> 40:09.409
is considered distasteful.

40:11.160 --> 40:14.846
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

40:15.120 --> 40:17.885
that your daughter Myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.202
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

40:28.560 --> 40:32.531
There's been too much amusement
here today.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.447
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.851
A royal wedding is history.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.209
Time has come for all of us
to contemplate our history.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.601
My lords,

40:49.360 --> 40:50.964
my ladies,

40:52.360 --> 40:53.725
I give you

40:54.680 --> 40:56.921
King Joffrey,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.606
Renly, Stannis,

40:59.680 --> 41:02.206
Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy!

41:03.240 --> 41:06.164
The War of the Five Kings!

41:09.480 --> 41:11.562
I'm the rightful king.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.247
- King in the North!
- Yes!

41:20.080 --> 41:21.491
Traitor.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.608
You're a traitor.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.921
I'm the King
of the Seven Kingdoms!

41:30.200 --> 41:32.089
Let the war begin.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.562
Renly, you're no king.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.244
Away, degenerate.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.051
Careful.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.327
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.244
Stannis!

41:55.320 --> 41:57.448
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.125
I am the rightful king.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.089
Challenge me, kraken.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.730
- Take that.
- I'm drowning!

42:02.800 --> 42:04.131
I am the King in the North!

42:09.120 --> 42:11.122
Not wildfire!

42:19.200 --> 42:20.964
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.763
Yes, my lord.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.729
We'll have to find another way
to thank the King.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.804
Charge!

42:36.960 --> 42:39.088
Ready? Again.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.689
I am the King in the North!

42:46.880 --> 42:48.484
- Charge!
- Charge!

42:48.920 --> 42:50.160
Yes!

42:50.480 --> 42:51.641
Your head!

43:28.200 --> 43:31.010
Fine gentlemen.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.806
Well fought.

43:41.880 --> 43:44.690
Here you are. Champion's purse.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.965
Though you're not the
champion yet, are you?

43:50.040 --> 43:54.250
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

43:55.040 --> 43:59.250
Surely there are others out there
who still dare to challenge my reign.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.241
Uncle.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.889
How about you?
I'm sure they have a spare costume.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.883
One taste of combat was enough for me,
Your Grace.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.167
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.409
I think you should fight him.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.521
This was but a poor imitation
of your own bravery on the field of battle.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.921
I speak as a firsthand witness.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.809
Climb down from the high table
with your new Valyrian sword

44:28.880 --> 44:32.168
and show everyone
how a true king wins his throne.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.485
Be careful, though.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.724
This one is clearly mad with lust.

44:38.080 --> 44:41.562
It would be a tragedy for
the King to lose his virtue

44:41.640 --> 44:44.166
hours before his wedding night.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.324
A fine vintage.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.970
Shame that it spilled.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.046
It did not spill.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.360
My love, come back to me.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.970
It's time for my father's toast.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.764
How does he expect me
to toast without wine?

45:31.040 --> 45:35.489
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

45:35.560 --> 45:37.289
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.685
Your Grace does me a great honour.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.926
It's not meant as an honour.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.800
Bring me my goblet.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.281
What good is an empty cup?

46:42.320 --> 46:43.321
Fill it.

46:57.480 --> 46:58.481
Kneel.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.210
Kneel before your king.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.566
Kneel.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.448
I said kneel!

47:24.360 --> 47:25.646
Look, the pie.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.440
My Queen.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.804
Wonderful.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.610
My hero.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.771
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.721
Uncle.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.806
Where are you going?

48:22.960 --> 48:24.644
You're my cupbearer, remember?

48:25.040 --> 48:27.611
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, Your Grace.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.251
No, you're perfect the way you are.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.485
Serve me my wine.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.681
Hurry up. This pie is dry.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.680
Mmm, good.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.289
Needs washing down.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.727
If it please Your Grace,

48:55.800 --> 48:58.531
- Lady Sansa is very tired.
- No.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.363
No, you'll wait here...

49:07.720 --> 49:08.846
Your Grace?

49:12.360 --> 49:13.361
It's nothing.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.371
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.885
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

49:31.280 --> 49:32.406
- Joffrey!
- Help him!

49:33.240 --> 49:35.242
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

49:37.240 --> 49:38.446
- Come with me now.
- Joffrey!

49:40.080 --> 49:42.128
If you want to live, we have to leave.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.401
Don't touch him!

49:49.720 --> 49:51.722
Joffrey.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.808
Please, Joffrey.

49:54.360 --> 49:57.204
Joffrey, what is it?

49:57.880 --> 49:59.450
Help him!

50:32.680 --> 50:35.001
My son.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.407
He did this.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.405
He poisoned my son,

50:52.480 --> 50:54.084
your king.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.564
Take him!

50:57.760 --> 51:01.128
Take him!
