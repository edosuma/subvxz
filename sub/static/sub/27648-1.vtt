00:00.533 --> 00:02.140
God made you the perfect lawyer.

00:02.165 --> 00:04.507
- I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

00:04.532 --> 00:07.158
<i>- Do we know each other?</i>
- No. But I know your dad.

00:07.183 --> 00:09.379
- Gerrilynn Spence is a liar.
- I resign.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.406
<i>I don't know how much
longer we can be us here.</i>

00:11.473 --> 00:13.264
<i>Molly, we became us here.</i>

00:13.298 --> 00:15.493
When Luna was born, when
she and my dad were together,

00:15.518 --> 00:16.659
Gerrilynn was underage.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.386
- You are the best dad I never had.
- I'll take that.

00:19.556 --> 00:21.064
<i>It's Gerrilynn's birth certificate.</i>

00:21.089 --> 00:23.204
You make them take
our settlement offer.

00:23.295 --> 00:25.110
I just did chemo, Dad,

00:25.135 --> 00:26.739
because of Matheson Steel.

00:26.764 --> 00:27.831
<i>I'll forgive you</i>

00:27.856 --> 00:29.845
if you just tell me the truth.
Just once.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.181
The Court has in front of it

00:31.206 --> 00:34.804
a $2-million payment
to each and every plaintiff.

00:34.829 --> 00:38.088
- My client agrees.
- Court is adjourned.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.775
<i>This is over.</i> I should go.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.326
Joanna, you can stop running.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.295
I got offered a job in Winnipeg.

00:44.455 --> 00:46.997
Steadman-Lavery. I'm a new
partner, it's my first day.

00:47.089 --> 00:51.002
- And your name?
- Chang. Joanna Chang.

01:12.332 --> 01:13.445
Call Billy.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.526
<i>Calling Billy Crawford.</i>

01:16.027 --> 01:17.305
Forget it. Hang up.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.463
<i>Canceling call to Billy Crawford.</i>

01:28.606 --> 01:31.019
<i>Left turn in 200m.</i>

01:53.585 --> 01:55.453
Oh, come on.

02:02.048 --> 02:03.540
What?

02:20.329 --> 02:21.869
What?

02:25.497 --> 02:28.130
<i>Joanna Chang?</i>

02:28.939 --> 02:32.612
- <i>Joanna Chang?</i>
- Yes?

02:32.850 --> 02:35.451
<i>Do we have your attention?</i>

03:12.212 --> 03:16.786
_

03:25.997 --> 03:28.565
Ahem!

03:34.432 --> 03:37.761
- Thanks for coming in early.
- I'm always early.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.556
- The guy is in a panic.
- And he asked for me?

03:41.590 --> 03:43.997
Specifically.
He followed Matheson Steel.

03:44.044 --> 03:46.093
He likes how you stuck it to the man.

03:46.382 --> 03:48.313
What does he want?

03:48.463 --> 03:50.752
Computer genius. Child prodigy.

03:50.777 --> 03:53.676
Created and sold his first app
when he was 12.

03:53.869 --> 03:56.604
He grew up here
then moved to Silicon Valley.

03:56.638 --> 03:59.207
Just go and see what the kid wants.

03:59.392 --> 04:01.844
You hired me to do
corporate transactions.

04:02.257 --> 04:03.897
Let me do what I love.

04:04.025 --> 04:06.380
He asked for you and he won't
talk to anyone else.

04:06.694 --> 04:08.330
Best case, he's the next Zuckerberg

04:08.355 --> 04:11.024
and we're in pole position
for corporate counsel.

04:13.074 --> 04:15.676
Leave your phone outside. His request.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.192
Good morning.

04:20.442 --> 04:22.376
You really haven't heard of me?

04:22.643 --> 04:24.699
I graduated Stanford with a Master's

04:24.733 --> 04:26.714
before I could legally buy a drink.

04:26.905 --> 04:28.524
You must be smart.

04:30.505 --> 04:33.140
So... Chang.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.263
Why'd you change your name?

04:35.797 --> 04:37.879
You quit the big law firm.
You brought down the local

04:37.904 --> 04:40.305
polluting steel company
in your hometown.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.236
I do my research.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.426
Let's get back to you.

04:46.822 --> 04:49.310
I am part of the privacy movement.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.460
It makes me an easy target.

04:51.663 --> 04:52.858
I'm a hacktivist.

04:52.883 --> 04:55.419
A hacker for the good side.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.021
Some call me an ideologue,

04:57.046 --> 04:58.633
but I think that's a bit pejorative.

04:58.725 --> 05:00.778
And your ex-employer
is threatening you?

05:00.813 --> 05:03.099
Yeah. You're good
under pressure, right?

05:03.124 --> 05:05.125
'Cause I got a lot of it.

05:16.077 --> 05:17.184
It's an injunction.

05:18.687 --> 05:20.737
This is serious.

05:20.762 --> 05:22.023
Yeah, I created an app

05:22.057 --> 05:23.517
and put it up for download.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.950
It targets my ex-employer.

05:25.975 --> 05:27.085
"Targets"?

05:27.110 --> 05:30.447
- Yeah.
- OK, well, if they've filed

05:30.472 --> 05:32.606
an injunction, you can bet
a lawsuit is coming.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.590
So, you'll help me?

05:34.615 --> 05:36.650
I need to look at the materials first.

05:36.675 --> 05:38.583
We actually don't have time for that.

05:38.608 --> 05:40.975
The hearing's this morning at...

05:42.061 --> 05:43.551
9 a.m.

06:21.099 --> 06:23.889
Crawford. Hey, Ben. What's up?

06:57.178 --> 06:58.386
<i>This would be easier</i>

06:58.420 --> 07:00.198
and better for you if you had a lawyer.

07:00.489 --> 07:03.057
- I've had enough of lawyers.
- Don't do this, Ben.

07:03.091 --> 07:05.559
- I'm keeping the table.
- It's the last item.

07:05.594 --> 07:07.712
We find common ground
on the table; you and Sharon

07:07.737 --> 07:09.771
can start your new lives.

07:10.545 --> 07:12.501
It's just a table, Ben.

07:13.352 --> 07:15.903
It's not just a table, Billy.

07:16.417 --> 07:19.616
I made this table. Made it myself.

07:20.021 --> 07:21.575
You ever built anything before?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.210
Didn't think so.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.659
You just tear things down, don't you?

07:28.984 --> 07:32.070
My daughter said her first words

07:32.206 --> 07:34.207
at this table right there.

07:37.744 --> 07:39.293
Does anybody know where she is?

07:40.513 --> 07:42.549
We just know that she's safe.

07:43.777 --> 07:46.449
Ah... I see.

07:49.062 --> 07:52.106
Are you going to thank me
in your acceptance speech today?

07:53.162 --> 07:54.909
Your award.

07:55.102 --> 07:58.628
"Matheson Steel lawsuit
wins case of the year."

07:58.653 --> 08:00.515
I like to think that I played a part

08:00.540 --> 08:03.028
in your victory worth a shout-out, no?

08:04.876 --> 08:06.789
Why are you still here, Billy?

08:06.876 --> 08:09.329
- The town's dying.
- Millwood's my home.

08:09.437 --> 08:11.778
You should have left with her
when you had the chance.

08:13.022 --> 08:15.029
You know what? Forget it.

08:15.942 --> 08:17.337
She can have the table.

08:17.362 --> 08:19.129
I'll sign...

08:19.674 --> 08:21.042
if...

08:24.252 --> 08:26.362
...you can get this letter to Taylor.

08:28.810 --> 08:31.695
- Ben, I don't know where she is.
- Yes, you do.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.486
Come on, Billy.

08:35.086 --> 08:37.533
We were friends once, remember?

08:38.364 --> 08:40.572
Please, just...

08:41.304 --> 08:42.923
put that in her hands.

08:43.158 --> 08:46.327
For me? This will all be done,
I promise.

08:50.273 --> 08:51.765
I talked to the owner.

08:51.973 --> 08:53.908
He said some jewelry's missing.

08:54.135 --> 08:57.037
And, uh, watches, rings
and a video game console.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.139
Third break-in on Main this month.

08:59.174 --> 09:01.075
Used to be a good town back in the day.

09:01.288 --> 09:02.910
Mill closing hurt a lot of people.

09:03.439 --> 09:06.096
- No one heard or saw anything?
- No.

09:06.374 --> 09:08.041
It's good to see you
back out on the street, Sam.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.348
14 feet right onto the rocks.

09:10.373 --> 09:12.754
Yeah, never try to fix
your cabin roof yourself.

09:12.779 --> 09:14.577
That's a lesson to both of you.

09:14.946 --> 09:17.007
Yeah, so video game console,

09:17.313 --> 09:18.708
it's probably kids.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.395
Well, that means
it's not a crime then, I guess.

09:22.463 --> 09:25.887
- Just narrowing the suspects.
- I know who I'd be looking at.

09:25.912 --> 09:27.748
The gang punks from Willow Road?

09:28.799 --> 09:30.729
This could have been anyone.

09:31.247 --> 09:32.562
Stats don't lie.

09:32.587 --> 09:35.497
Good people get through
tough times, this is different.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.758
There's a camera outside The Boot.

09:37.783 --> 09:40.017
If they took off through
the alley, we'll see 'em.

09:40.221 --> 09:43.957
Beckbie, you need to go talk to
your people, solve this thing.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.562
Breakfast is almost ready.

09:54.596 --> 09:58.678
Thank you, baby.
I really hope I do better today.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.278
You're gonna do great.

10:00.371 --> 10:02.458
Lu, you helped win a
class action lawsuit,

10:02.483 --> 10:04.982
I'm sure you can learn
how to wait tables.

10:05.364 --> 10:07.474
Hmm! I'll order you a ride.

10:07.509 --> 10:09.437
No, it's fine. I can take the bus.

10:09.537 --> 10:12.945
- Why would you take the bus?
- Because I can't spend

10:12.970 --> 10:14.459
my paycheque getting to work.

10:14.524 --> 10:17.056
So then, let me pay for it.

10:21.573 --> 10:23.223
Did you have fun last night?

10:23.591 --> 10:25.258
Sure.

10:27.229 --> 10:29.597
You didn't talk much.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.874
Lu, I was really excited

10:31.899 --> 10:33.303
for you to meet my friends.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.058
And I think they're nice.

10:37.276 --> 10:39.916
Hmm... You have a doctor's
appointment today, don't forget.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.076
You know, I made it
to all my doctor's appointments

10:42.110 --> 10:43.844
- when you were at school.
- Hmm?

10:43.878 --> 10:46.747
Almost all my doctor's appointments.

10:46.992 --> 10:48.425
Now that I'm back,

10:48.450 --> 10:51.418
I just want to make
it easier on you, OK?

10:51.453 --> 10:53.921
Babe, I'm doing OK.

10:53.955 --> 10:57.422
Three months, no twitching.

10:58.855 --> 11:02.057
And I am going to make

11:02.082 --> 11:04.639
some space in the closet.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.334
You need to unpack.

11:08.528 --> 11:10.656
I got this place for us.

11:10.768 --> 11:13.608
I know. But first, I gotta go to work.

11:13.651 --> 11:15.521
You don't have to work.
I have the settlement money,

11:15.546 --> 11:17.880
- you don't have to work.
- No. No.

11:18.546 --> 11:21.948
In my family, baby, we work.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.030
With an injunction hearing,
the court will look to see

11:29.055 --> 11:31.632
if an immediate action needs
to be taken before a trial.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.252
- OK, what do I do?
- Nothing.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.412
What? I just sit there?!

11:34.437 --> 11:36.785
Don't say anything,
don't do anything unless I ask.

11:36.878 --> 11:38.666
We can't lose this.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.405
You should have given me more time.

11:41.938 --> 11:43.937
An injunction is too harsh

11:43.972 --> 11:46.124
a remedy before a trial on the merits.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.242
The defendant's
computer program contains code

11:48.276 --> 11:50.316
which is substantially similar to ours,

11:50.391 --> 11:52.526
a violation of our intellectual
property rights

11:52.551 --> 11:54.676
No. Actually, the code
is totally different.

11:54.743 --> 11:56.516
They are more
than substantially similar.

11:56.556 --> 12:00.209
- No, no, they're not.
- Ms. Chang, control your client.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.429
Of course, Your Honour. I apologize.

12:09.531 --> 12:11.899
Any similarity simply represents

12:11.933 --> 12:14.501
my client's unique coding style.

12:14.536 --> 12:16.336
It doesn't rise
to the level of copying.

12:16.786 --> 12:19.473
The defendant's program is parasitic.

12:19.498 --> 12:21.253
Mr. Achari has created an app

12:21.278 --> 12:23.277
that intentionally interferes
with our core business

12:23.311 --> 12:25.574
and has caused
severe financial suffering.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.094
We ask the court to compel him
to remove it immediately.

12:28.397 --> 12:31.618
Yes, I see your damage
calculation in your submissions.

12:31.653 --> 12:34.562
And you, Ms. Chang,
have made no submission

12:34.587 --> 12:37.458
as to the business purpose
of your client's product.

12:37.955 --> 12:41.649
We request more time
to prepare the submissions.

12:41.786 --> 12:44.131
I've only been
on this case for an hour.

12:48.169 --> 12:51.285
The court finds there is an
immediate and substantial threat

12:51.310 --> 12:53.078
of irreparable damages.

12:53.754 --> 12:55.655
Your request is denied.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.344
Your client must comply immediately.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.322
You should expect a "Statement
of Claim" to arrive shortly,

13:07.347 --> 13:09.180
but swiftly complying
with the injunction

13:09.205 --> 13:10.633
will mitigate damages.

13:11.793 --> 13:14.844
- That means lower, that's good.
- Yeah, I know what it means.

13:15.050 --> 13:17.410
Once you take the app down,
we'll need to sign a declaration

13:17.442 --> 13:18.884
of compliance for the court.

13:18.909 --> 13:20.977
- How do we take it down?
- It's not that simple.

13:21.002 --> 13:22.531
You can't do it with
just any old computer?

13:22.556 --> 13:25.002
Oh, I can and I know how to,
but I can't.

13:25.027 --> 13:27.655
You know what? The court
upheld the injunction.

13:28.072 --> 13:30.878
- I know, I was there.
- You need to comply!

13:30.912 --> 13:33.447
I'm the only one who knows
how to take down this app,

13:33.472 --> 13:35.364
- and I'm not gonna do it.
- You don't have a choice.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.317
Really? 'Cause I'm
choosing not to do it.

13:37.342 --> 13:39.031
- They'll hold you in contempt.
- Great.

13:39.056 --> 13:40.404
- You may go to jail.
- Fine.

13:40.497 --> 13:42.684
You need to start
taking this seriously.

13:42.709 --> 13:45.731
I know how serious this is,
but my answer is no.

13:46.307 --> 13:47.661
I won't take it down,

13:47.686 --> 13:49.674
and I can't tell you why.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.995
No, I am your lawyer.

13:52.627 --> 13:54.569
You can tell me why.

13:57.405 --> 13:59.557
Fine, here's your homework:

13:59.734 --> 14:02.478
write down everything you
remember about working for them

14:02.503 --> 14:05.187
and meet me at my office at 3.

14:13.288 --> 14:15.523
- Hey, how was the injunction?
- Don't ask.

14:15.557 --> 14:17.562
Well, there's a lawyer waiting
for you up in the boardroom.

14:17.587 --> 14:18.655
Computer case?

14:18.700 --> 14:21.168
- He didn't say.
- Maybe they want to deal.

14:33.007 --> 14:34.407
Joanna "Chang"?

14:34.470 --> 14:36.471
What are you doing here, Dad?

14:36.774 --> 14:39.361
I came to see you.
What do you want me to do?

14:39.386 --> 14:41.720
You don't return any of my phone calls.

14:44.259 --> 14:48.195
Look, I've made mistakes,
and I know that now.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.791
That's what therapy has taught me.

14:50.992 --> 14:53.327
You've been in therapy?

14:54.509 --> 14:56.596
Apparently, I have a long way to go.

14:56.725 --> 15:01.343
I just wanted you to know the positive
steps that I'm taking to change.

15:03.078 --> 15:04.696
OK.

15:05.099 --> 15:07.815
- I'm working hard.
- Oh, you want credit.

15:07.883 --> 15:10.351
It's not why I'm doing this.

15:15.909 --> 15:18.338
How's the new firm? What do
they have you working on?

15:18.399 --> 15:20.400
I'm not doing this with you.

15:20.434 --> 15:22.478
Come on, Joanna.

15:22.664 --> 15:24.131
There's nothing more important to me

15:24.156 --> 15:25.930
than my relationship with you.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.811
Look, you should know

15:27.836 --> 15:30.304
that that issue in Millwood,

15:30.405 --> 15:33.333
I've been cleared.
Do you mean Gerrilynn?

15:33.407 --> 15:36.076
Yeah. The Crown's not
pursuing criminal charges.

15:36.187 --> 15:38.691
There are some questions about
validity of her birth certificate.

15:38.716 --> 15:40.394
Her parents didn't
register her right away.

15:40.459 --> 15:41.960
They said they would
not hold up in court.

15:41.985 --> 15:43.483
Really? "They said"?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.285
I had nothing to do with that.

15:47.454 --> 15:49.250
You know, we're talking
about a matter of months.

15:49.356 --> 15:51.257
We're talking about a crime.

15:52.142 --> 15:54.477
When I met her,
she was working in a bar.

15:54.515 --> 15:57.366
- You have to be 18 to do that.
- So, that makes it OK?

15:57.404 --> 15:59.238
It makes it a mistake, not a crime.

15:59.266 --> 16:01.808
Not a provable crime.

16:04.284 --> 16:07.899
I came here to see you,
not to argue about the past.

16:07.924 --> 16:10.626
- I need to get back to work.
- What's wrong?

16:10.825 --> 16:13.393
- You don't seem OK.
- I'm OK.

16:15.787 --> 16:17.100
You've never practiced without me.

16:17.131 --> 16:19.098
I've done fine without you.

16:19.233 --> 16:21.464
Sure, you won the Matheson Steel case,

16:21.562 --> 16:24.924
you beat me, resorted
to dirty tricks, but, hey,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.881
you're a Hanley

16:27.187 --> 16:29.421
no matter what name
you put on your door.

16:32.253 --> 16:34.253
You should go home.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.869
Hiya. Here's your martini.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.714
Thank you.

16:55.592 --> 16:57.025
- Mom?
- <i>Hey, Baby.</i>

16:57.059 --> 16:59.260
Hey. I can't talk
right now. I'm at work.

16:59.448 --> 17:01.449
This'll just take a second.

17:03.018 --> 17:04.978
They're dropping the charges

17:05.002 --> 17:08.569
against David. Some bullshit
about your <i>kookum</i> not filing

17:08.594 --> 17:10.605
my birth certificate
on time or something.

17:11.243 --> 17:14.180
<i>Which is a total lie.
I mean, I know how old I was.</i>

17:16.460 --> 17:19.184
<i>Luna? You're still there?</i>

17:24.204 --> 17:27.140
Joanna, you need to call me back.

17:27.334 --> 17:30.004
I don't get it.
My mom's birth certificate

17:30.029 --> 17:31.777
says she was underage.

17:31.838 --> 17:35.139
Guys like David get off with nothing.

17:35.509 --> 17:37.844
But not this time. I don't know how,

17:37.869 --> 17:40.037
but he's gonna pay for what he did.

17:40.164 --> 17:42.621
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.997
Hi. Just gotta rev it a couple of times

17:55.022 --> 17:56.683
before you throw it into gear.

18:06.679 --> 18:09.705
<i>I don't know how, but
he's gonna pay for what he did.</i>

18:09.870 --> 18:12.190
<i>He's gonna get what's coming to him.</i>

18:14.328 --> 18:15.690
It's almost time for the luncheon.

18:15.737 --> 18:17.934
Make sure you tell everyone
you're with Steadman-Lavery.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.363
I'm having problems
with the computer kid.

18:20.543 --> 18:21.807
You'll figure it out.

18:21.832 --> 18:24.366
No, he's not listening
to any of my advice.

18:24.452 --> 18:26.802
Well, make him listen.

18:27.061 --> 18:28.464
Joanna, Great lawyering

18:28.489 --> 18:31.057
isn't about the law,
it's about relationships.

18:31.092 --> 18:34.149
Every client is like a child.
I know because I've got two of them.

18:34.174 --> 18:36.536
They want what they
want when they want it.

18:36.561 --> 18:38.679
You need to act like their mother.

18:38.888 --> 18:41.067
How did you handle things in Millwood?

18:41.748 --> 18:43.536
I had a good partner.

18:44.144 --> 18:45.572
This is not a request.

18:45.606 --> 18:48.247
You're well compensated;
I expect you to figure it out.

18:49.070 --> 18:51.507
Have a great time
at the awards and remember,

18:51.532 --> 18:53.315
let yourself have some fun.

19:28.442 --> 19:30.222
The Crown won't
prosecute unless there is

19:30.247 --> 19:32.399
a likelihood of success
of a conviction.

19:32.446 --> 19:33.736
It's in their discretion.

19:33.761 --> 19:35.392
There's DNA. There's me.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.323
I should be all the proof they need.

19:37.908 --> 19:39.980
Reasonable doubt is a high standard.

19:40.029 --> 19:42.708
It is very had to get a conviction.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.082
Can you please just talk to me

19:45.107 --> 19:47.734
like my sister and not my lawyer?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.881
She was a kid.

19:54.501 --> 19:57.370
- What he did was wrong.
- He just gets away with it?

19:58.433 --> 20:00.146
The law is imperfect.

20:03.690 --> 20:06.186
You didn't want him to go to jail.

20:07.056 --> 20:08.902
- Luna...
- Do you think he deserves to?

20:08.927 --> 20:11.663
Doesn't matter what I wanted.
It wasn't gonna happen,

20:11.688 --> 20:13.689
I told you that. I told everyone.

20:14.061 --> 20:16.451
I want to hear you say it.

20:21.769 --> 20:24.304
I have to go finish my shift.

20:34.255 --> 20:36.015
How was the luncheon?

20:36.135 --> 20:38.277
I didn't make it. Something came up.

20:38.345 --> 20:40.416
Aw, that would have been
good exposure for us.

20:40.521 --> 20:43.229
Yeah. Sorry, it's just been
one of those days.

20:43.335 --> 20:45.144
Joanna...

20:45.394 --> 20:47.303
you know, when I started
out in this business,

20:47.328 --> 20:49.163
I was a disaster.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.668
I was working long hours,

20:50.693 --> 20:52.804
killing myself trying
to prove that I was

20:52.829 --> 20:54.074
the smartest person in the room.

20:54.099 --> 20:56.122
I didn't think
that I was gonna last a year.

20:56.394 --> 20:59.238
And then, I got stuck in an
elevator with a senior partner.

20:59.298 --> 21:01.592
- Oh, I had nightmares about that.
- I know, right?

21:01.617 --> 21:04.171
No. Like wake up in a cold
sweat kind of nightmares.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.297
It was the best break that I ever had.

21:06.645 --> 21:09.437
After 10 minutes of horrible silence,

21:09.524 --> 21:11.258
I decided to take a chance,

21:11.283 --> 21:14.119
and I cracked open just a little bit.

21:14.210 --> 21:17.301
And so did she.
Because up until that time,

21:17.335 --> 21:20.338
I didn't think that you could be
a lawyer and a human being,

21:20.363 --> 21:22.842
I thought you had to choose.
But it turns out

21:22.911 --> 21:25.879
that if you want to be a better
lawyer, you need to be a happier human.

21:26.107 --> 21:28.536
When was the last time
that you had sex?

21:29.252 --> 21:31.225
Oh, Lavery, I know, boundaries, God!

21:31.250 --> 21:33.075
But seriously, what has it been?
Like months?

21:33.179 --> 21:35.012
I appreciate your concern, but...

21:35.037 --> 21:38.102
- Oh, God! It's been years.
- I like things as they are.

21:38.127 --> 21:40.261
Joanna, you need to let people in.

21:40.706 --> 21:42.174
You don't even eat lunch with people.

21:42.199 --> 21:44.767
- Well, I work through lunch.
- Exactly. You've been here

21:44.819 --> 21:46.659
for the whole winter and nobody here

21:46.684 --> 21:48.046
knows anything about you.

21:48.071 --> 21:49.292
They know me by my work.

21:49.317 --> 21:51.806
If you were to die tomorrow,
who would be at your funeral?

21:51.832 --> 21:53.165
- What?
- Think about the pews.

21:53.190 --> 21:54.509
Is it a big crowd?

21:54.572 --> 21:56.003
You don't invest in relationships

21:56.028 --> 21:57.699
because you don't value them.

21:57.724 --> 21:59.622
Well, I play to my strengths.

21:59.744 --> 22:02.531
The relationships are not the
problem, they're just a symptom.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.091
You are the problem.
Joanna, you need to just

22:05.162 --> 22:06.844
get out of your own way.

22:06.869 --> 22:08.484
Show a little bit of yourself.

22:08.509 --> 22:10.277
Someone told you that
there was a reward

22:10.302 --> 22:12.202
for being the last person
in the office?

22:12.337 --> 22:15.158
There is no trophy
for working yourself to death.

22:40.021 --> 22:42.085
Boys, can I have a little chat?

22:42.580 --> 22:44.187
Hey! Stay right there!

22:44.222 --> 22:46.056
Hey, stop!

22:53.604 --> 22:54.964
Argh!

23:07.254 --> 23:08.980
_

23:11.908 --> 23:13.440
Oh yeah, yeah.

23:13.677 --> 23:15.685
I know these alleyways too.

23:16.076 --> 23:18.809
Ran from my share of police
back in the day.

23:19.257 --> 23:22.238
You know anything about the
theft at the Pawn Shop on Main?

23:25.651 --> 23:27.431
Maybe I should just search your room.

23:27.666 --> 23:29.699
Can't do that without a warrant.

23:30.173 --> 23:31.840
I know your <i>kookum.</i>

23:34.200 --> 23:36.631
Maybe I knock on the door and ask her.

23:37.646 --> 23:39.647
It wasn't my idea.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.871
OK.

23:44.662 --> 23:48.031
We split up all the stuff,
so I can't give it all back.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.563
Who was with you?

23:55.224 --> 23:57.125
Come on, turn around.

24:18.502 --> 24:21.228
Let's go. Watch your head.

24:42.793 --> 24:44.894
Your lawyer bash over already?

24:46.447 --> 24:48.781
Oh, I just got my award and left.

24:48.816 --> 24:50.263
It's not really my scene.

24:50.353 --> 24:51.651
Joanna skipped it?

24:52.504 --> 24:53.786
Work stuff.

24:56.678 --> 24:58.224
How's the apartment?

24:58.418 --> 25:00.059
Oh, it's just small,

25:00.094 --> 25:02.462
but I have everything
that I need. Thanks.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.959
They were looking for a good tenant.

25:07.167 --> 25:08.903
And your last appointment?

25:08.928 --> 25:14.216
Um, I met with the oncologists last...
Tuesday.

25:14.629 --> 25:17.110
They said all was good... so far.

25:17.460 --> 25:20.645
I'm slowly getting my memory
back, but until then...

25:20.785 --> 25:22.791
One day at a time.

25:24.919 --> 25:26.586
So...?

25:32.425 --> 25:35.427
He asked me to give this to you,
but I can't make you read it.

25:37.254 --> 25:39.365
They just want to know
that you're alright.

25:39.698 --> 25:42.402
- Did you tell them where I am?
- No. You told me not to.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.904
You're the client. You're in charge.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.839
I'm not ready to see either of them.

25:47.066 --> 25:48.608
I'm not asking you to see them, Taylor.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.969
You just said I'm in charge.

25:56.463 --> 25:58.430
Are they getting a divorce?

26:02.215 --> 26:04.049
Sorry.

26:05.282 --> 26:07.226
The house is up for sale.

26:07.577 --> 26:09.983
I can arrange to have your stuff
brought down to the city.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.170
I don't need any of it.

26:13.159 --> 26:15.260
How about I keep it at my place?

26:16.017 --> 26:19.683
I know you feel guilty for
what the case did to my family.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.575
You shouldn't.

26:22.860 --> 26:25.545
We were broken long before
he dumped those barrels;

26:25.820 --> 26:27.538
we just hid it well.

26:34.133 --> 26:36.234
See you around, Billy.

26:40.314 --> 26:41.563
Yeah?

26:41.708 --> 26:44.734
Ugh! The old case files
from Noah's old lawyer.

26:44.974 --> 26:47.341
- He had a lawyer before us?
- Apparently.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.469
He said they just sent the injunction.

26:49.686 --> 26:51.420
They have been after him for years.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.675
It's cease and desist letters,
threats of old suits,

26:53.700 --> 26:55.584
which were all ignored.

26:55.826 --> 26:57.673
He really pissed off the wrong people.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.960
- It's a tech company.
- Novatech is just a subsidiary.

27:01.017 --> 27:04.000
Those lawyers today,
they were from Lovand.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.214
- The defense contractor?
- Yes, but it's more than that.

27:06.239 --> 27:08.769
It is weapons systems.
It's private armies.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.613
These people overthrow governments.

27:10.753 --> 27:12.792
- What do they want with Noah?
- Who cares?

27:13.413 --> 27:14.627
Let's just dump all of this

27:14.661 --> 27:17.029
on the sidewalk and pretend
we never got this case.

27:17.064 --> 27:19.230
We can't do that, we're his lawyers.

27:19.466 --> 27:21.479
Once we say we're in, we're in.

27:21.504 --> 27:23.564
Look, I've gone up
against big companies before.

27:23.589 --> 27:25.059
They love making threats;

27:25.084 --> 27:26.606
they never follow through with them.

27:26.928 --> 27:28.841
It's going to be OK.

27:40.627 --> 27:42.440
Hey, Luna.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.014
How's your day?

27:47.178 --> 27:48.494
Eh...

27:51.271 --> 27:53.666
Luna, your mom called me.

27:54.178 --> 27:57.199
Look, it's David Hanley, OK?
We knew it was a long shot.

27:57.224 --> 27:58.738
Why is it a long shot?

27:58.772 --> 28:01.031
Why do all the David Hanley's go free?

28:01.104 --> 28:04.464
You need to forget all
the things you can't control.

28:04.606 --> 28:06.803
- Let it go.
- I can't.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.334
You helped me last year,

28:09.429 --> 28:11.330
and I'm gonna help you now.

28:11.957 --> 28:16.217
We're going out.
Screw you David Hanley night.

28:18.112 --> 28:19.358
Come.

28:20.125 --> 28:23.574
OK? Come here.

28:42.580 --> 28:44.417
Things are changing in Millwood.

28:44.966 --> 28:46.419
And not for the better.

28:46.646 --> 28:48.213
There are people who are gonna look

28:48.238 --> 28:49.687
for someone to blame.

28:50.439 --> 28:52.397
And they always blame us.

28:55.274 --> 28:57.289
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

28:58.506 --> 29:00.064
You have to be better than them

29:00.122 --> 29:01.583
because they're always
looking for a chance

29:01.607 --> 29:03.213
to make us wear this.

29:04.770 --> 29:06.604
It's not fair, but...

29:07.908 --> 29:09.762
...it's just the way it is right now.

29:10.204 --> 29:11.617
You understand?

29:11.698 --> 29:13.370
Yes, Officer.

29:21.465 --> 29:23.154
Tell your friends everything goes back.

29:23.517 --> 29:24.670
I promise.

29:24.735 --> 29:27.370
Everyone stays straight.
Everyone stays out of trouble.

29:30.729 --> 29:34.431
Tough times are coming.
This is your one free pass.

29:38.758 --> 29:39.934
<i>I-I'm telling you, privacy</i>

29:39.959 --> 29:42.162
- isn't a joke.
- I didn't say it was.

29:42.187 --> 29:43.468
No, you didn't have to.

29:43.493 --> 29:45.874
You don't value it because
it's never been threatened,

29:45.920 --> 29:48.777
which is why I created
the app in the first place.

29:50.404 --> 29:52.797
What if people could see
your Internet searches?

29:53.033 --> 29:55.038
- Pardon?
- That's where my app comes in.

29:55.063 --> 29:56.311
It's a data scrambler.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.918
I don't know what that means.
Speak non-tech.

30:00.051 --> 30:01.766
OK. When a company tries

30:01.791 --> 30:02.892
to mine your data,

30:02.917 --> 30:05.207
my app takes your data and
sticks it in a blender.

30:05.321 --> 30:06.659
OK. Purées it.

30:06.718 --> 30:10.665
Exactly. No one is identifiable. And
the data they try and take is useless.

30:10.761 --> 30:12.138
OK, but what's the urgency?

30:12.163 --> 30:14.651
So the app goes down for a
few months, what's the harm?

30:14.738 --> 30:17.620
A few months of an algorithm
churning endlessly,

30:17.645 --> 30:19.612
digging into every secret part
of your life?!

30:20.245 --> 30:22.213
Yeah, "what's the harm?"

30:22.827 --> 30:24.082
Oh, my God!

30:24.107 --> 30:26.118
You think that if you don't
do anything wrong,

30:26.153 --> 30:27.487
then who cares what the tech companies

30:27.512 --> 30:29.494
or government know about you?

30:29.519 --> 30:30.778
Like you're always honest?

30:30.803 --> 30:33.996
- You always do the right thing?
- I try to.

30:35.762 --> 30:38.597
I mean, what if people knew
that you searched...

30:38.845 --> 30:41.542
"Am I having a nervous breakdown?"

30:43.649 --> 30:46.236
Or that quiz you took,
"Signs you're a sociopath,"

30:46.261 --> 30:47.907
and - oh, God - you scored a "maybe"?

30:47.941 --> 30:50.109
Are you threatening me?

30:50.285 --> 30:52.378
What? No, I...

30:52.485 --> 30:54.580
No, I'm just... I'm hacking you.

30:55.372 --> 30:56.707
Took less than a minute.

30:56.732 --> 30:58.312
Imagine what they could do
if my app came down.

30:58.337 --> 31:01.645
- I thought you believed in privacy.
- I do. I was proving a point.

31:01.899 --> 31:03.889
OK. We are done for today.

31:03.924 --> 31:06.260
What about, "Is my father
a sexual predator?"

31:06.285 --> 31:08.327
- You don't want people...
- That is none of your business!

31:09.231 --> 31:10.763
Exactly. OK, exactly.

31:10.797 --> 31:13.152
None of that is any of my business.

31:13.212 --> 31:16.001
I shouldn't know that, but I do
because you searched it.

31:16.216 --> 31:18.571
You need to leave right now.

31:19.169 --> 31:22.074
- No, I think you're...
- Please, leave.

31:36.481 --> 31:38.168
_

31:49.764 --> 31:51.630
You gotta take a break sometimes.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.212
Here. I stole these from the luncheon.

31:56.368 --> 31:58.621
I'm not sure, but I think these are

31:58.646 --> 32:00.514
what you call... tarts.

32:01.507 --> 32:04.306
I'm sorry I missed it.

32:05.644 --> 32:07.652
You didn't miss much. Lots of speeches.

32:07.677 --> 32:09.286
Really bad lawyer jokes.

32:09.385 --> 32:12.072
It was like Little League
soccer, everyone gets a trophy.

32:13.652 --> 32:16.047
We're gonna have to figure out
how we share custody.

32:16.259 --> 32:18.053
One week on, one week off
just seems like

32:18.078 --> 32:20.879
a lot of driving, so why don't
you keep it for the first year.

32:20.933 --> 32:22.970
- You keep it.
- No, we gotta share it.

32:22.995 --> 32:25.796
- Billy, please.
- We worked hard on that case.

32:25.831 --> 32:27.832
- We didn't win fairly.
- That's not true.

32:27.866 --> 32:29.700
- I don't deserve an award.
- We had them on the ropes.

32:29.735 --> 32:31.869
- It was blackmail.
- They were beaten.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.008
Can we... can we not talk about it?

32:40.148 --> 32:41.645
How's work?

32:43.662 --> 32:47.051
I have a new client who doesn't
want to take any of my advice.

32:47.426 --> 32:49.282
Yeah, they pay you for your advice

32:49.307 --> 32:51.275
and then they never want to take it.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.394
How's your work?

32:55.166 --> 32:57.537
You know, the crazy,
live-on the-razor's-edge life

32:57.562 --> 32:59.563
of a small-town lawyer.

33:00.554 --> 33:02.790
Last week, Mrs. Tidgwell
asked me to change her will

33:02.815 --> 33:04.562
to include her cat.

33:05.303 --> 33:06.604
You really should have stuck around.

33:06.629 --> 33:09.573
You and I, we could have dominated
the feline beneficiary business.

33:09.695 --> 33:12.410
I'm sure you have more to do than that.

33:13.417 --> 33:15.713
How is it working out here?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.137
I love it.

33:20.110 --> 33:22.478
You need to get back to Millwood.

33:22.587 --> 33:24.665
Ah, no, there's no rush. I drive fast.

33:24.749 --> 33:28.218
I've got a long night
of work ahead of me, so...

33:35.033 --> 33:36.773
Take care of yourself.

33:43.326 --> 33:44.832
Bye, Billy.

34:02.006 --> 34:05.429
Hey! Did you still want
the research on Lovand?

34:05.464 --> 34:08.099
Want? No. But...

34:08.703 --> 34:10.034
Thank you. Yeah.

34:10.068 --> 34:11.839
Hey, do you mind if I...

34:12.237 --> 34:14.677
get out of here? I'm meeting
some friends in Osborne Village.

34:14.784 --> 34:16.867
- No, of course.
- Yeah, there's this

34:16.893 --> 34:20.530
great band playing, and I might
be able to catch the last set, so...

34:20.735 --> 34:22.320
You like music?

34:24.467 --> 34:26.059
Yeah, yeah.

34:26.184 --> 34:29.186
I used to play in a band in law school.

34:29.387 --> 34:32.745
It was called Strict Liability.

34:33.030 --> 34:36.099
Uhhuh.

34:36.512 --> 34:38.295
What kind of music do you like?

34:38.387 --> 34:39.915
Ummm....

34:40.958 --> 34:44.393
All kinds of music.

34:47.693 --> 34:50.237
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.443
Sunil, wait. Um,

34:52.553 --> 34:54.745
what do you know about me?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.054
- Excuse me?
- Nobody has spent

34:57.080 --> 34:58.693
more time with me than you.

34:58.803 --> 35:01.947
Just... what do you know about me?

35:02.928 --> 35:04.529
I mean...

35:04.731 --> 35:06.711
You know, not much.
I know that you worked

35:06.736 --> 35:08.865
at that big law firm
in Toronto before this.

35:08.890 --> 35:11.003
And you did the Millwood case.

35:11.941 --> 35:16.367
You eat the exact same thing
for lunch every day.

35:18.762 --> 35:20.936
And you're...

35:21.367 --> 35:24.075
in your 30s. Probably.

35:29.532 --> 35:30.705
You don't have a family;

35:30.730 --> 35:33.286
otherwise, you know,
there'd be pictures of them.

35:33.385 --> 35:35.420
In fact, you don't have
any personal items

35:35.445 --> 35:36.954
in your office at all.

35:39.778 --> 35:43.317
But you, uh... I've learned
a lot about the law

35:43.431 --> 35:45.000
from you.

35:47.265 --> 35:48.732
Thank you.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.493
Yeah.

36:03.894 --> 36:05.483
Saw your truck.

36:05.922 --> 36:08.732
Did you come straight from the
city right to that bar stool?

36:08.820 --> 36:12.223
Yeah, I had to do a buck 40 the
whole way to make it for last call.

36:12.724 --> 36:15.910
- You know I'm a cop, right?
- Oh, shit!

36:19.016 --> 36:21.017
So, it went that well?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.601
Can I get another one of those?

36:26.928 --> 36:28.479
Why are you up so late?

36:28.586 --> 36:31.457
Aah... Lot on my mind.

36:33.912 --> 36:36.444
Take arms against a sea of troubles.

36:43.131 --> 36:45.456
Hey, do you think I should have left?

36:45.570 --> 36:48.637
Billy Crawford couldn't
survive a week without Millwood.

36:49.523 --> 36:51.404
Couldn't imagine the place without you.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.116
Feels like a lost cause,

36:56.988 --> 36:59.589
trying to save something
that doesn't want to be saved.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.760
I just want to raise my kids in
the same Millwood I grew up in.

37:08.846 --> 37:12.182
Come on. I'll drive you home.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.589
Careful! There's needles over there.

39:10.242 --> 39:11.491
Sharps!

39:11.766 --> 39:15.781
Check over there. Hey, are you OK?

39:15.934 --> 39:17.597
Yeah. I'm just heading home.

39:17.991 --> 39:21.334
- We'll walk with you.
- I'm fine, thanks.

39:21.479 --> 39:23.836
We've got one of our own alone here.

39:23.871 --> 39:25.838
We're just gonna make sure
she gets home alright.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.590
We'll make sure you get home safe.

39:28.648 --> 39:31.216
That's why Bear Clan's out here.

39:53.166 --> 39:54.734
- You leave the door open?
- No.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.395
Hey, stay in the car, Billy.

39:56.582 --> 39:58.143
It's my house.

39:59.119 --> 40:01.345
- Do you have any weapons in the house?
- Of course not.

40:01.501 --> 40:03.536
Everyone knows you got
a big payoff on the case.

40:03.677 --> 40:07.141
- Well, I don't keep it here.
- People are desperate.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.772
Hey, brother...

40:33.846 --> 40:36.531
- Shane.
- I'm back.

40:37.814 --> 40:39.812
Yo, I need a place to crash.

40:53.507 --> 40:55.741
Hey! Hey!

40:55.907 --> 40:58.287
I was just going for a
walk downtown when I...

40:58.312 --> 40:59.380
I'll call the police.

40:59.405 --> 41:02.024
No, there's three floors of concrete,
they can't track us down here.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.738
I just came down here to apologize.

41:06.647 --> 41:08.474
I am so sorry.

41:08.768 --> 41:11.774
Look, this is why I didn't
take down my app.

41:13.093 --> 41:16.783
The code is a data-gathering
algorithm capable of self-learning.

41:17.119 --> 41:19.094
It tracks subtle changes
to facial movements

41:19.119 --> 41:21.354
to detect and pinpoint
enemy combatants.

41:21.379 --> 41:24.682
It detects radicalization.
It was used by the military.

41:25.460 --> 41:27.802
But it's been recalibrated
to detect anything -

41:27.827 --> 41:31.441
political opinions, sexual
orientation, gender identity.

41:31.784 --> 41:35.658
Lovand has weaponized it
and put it into a video game.

41:36.670 --> 41:38.480
But that's just the R&D portion.

41:38.505 --> 41:41.247
Once the tech is perfected,
it'll be everywhere.

41:41.309 --> 41:44.610
Facial recognition software capable
of knowing your darkest secrets,

41:44.770 --> 41:47.213
using anything
that has a computer chip:

41:47.247 --> 41:50.149
your laptop, your phone,
your coffee maker.

41:51.070 --> 41:52.685
It'll be inescapable.

41:53.589 --> 41:55.277
There are other legal avenues

41:55.302 --> 41:57.177
you can take if you want
to try and stop them.

41:57.202 --> 41:59.431
No. This isn't just about privacy!

41:59.837 --> 42:01.868
My life is in danger.

42:01.981 --> 42:04.082
Then, you should go to the police.

42:04.198 --> 42:07.807
You have no idea who these people are!

42:12.039 --> 42:14.543
The only reason I am alive right now

42:14.568 --> 42:16.400
is because they have no idea
how to take down my app.

42:16.469 --> 42:19.719
If they did, I'd be dead.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.324
I went home today,
and someone had been there.

42:24.349 --> 42:26.090
Inside my house.

42:26.263 --> 42:28.285
They want me to know
that they can get to me.

42:28.656 --> 42:30.942
They'll kill anyone who
learns about their secret.

42:31.021 --> 42:32.447
Me...

42:34.047 --> 42:35.981
...and now you.

42:41.079 --> 42:42.594
Joanna, please, I need your help.

42:42.619 --> 42:43.860
You want to have a proper meeting?

42:43.935 --> 42:46.672
You call me in my office tomorrow.

43:04.343 --> 43:05.584
Come on.

43:12.866 --> 43:16.168
<i>Joanna
Chang, do we have your attention?</i>

43:16.559 --> 43:18.371
<i>Lovand has weaponized it</i>

43:18.405 --> 43:20.373
<i>and put it in a video game.</i>

43:20.407 --> 43:22.408
<i>My life is in danger.</i>

43:22.584 --> 43:25.578
<i>Drop the case. You have been warned.</i>
