00:02.120 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.480 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.760 --> 00:22.520
Another setback for the once
prominent Bluth family...

00:22.640 --> 00:24.440
<i>as their frozen banana stand...</i>

00:24.560 --> 00:26.760
<i>a Newport Beach landmark
burns to the ground.</i>

00:26.840 --> 00:30.160
<i>A delicious whodunit after this.</i>

00:31.640 --> 00:33.120
<i>A week before the fire...</i>

00:33.240 --> 00:36.440
<i>Michael Bluth was trying
to save the Bluth Company...</i>

00:36.560 --> 00:39.800
<i>- but his father was making it difficult.
- I need the flight records, Dad.</i>

00:39.920 --> 00:41.960
I'm trying to find some money
for the family.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.840
There's always money in the banana stand.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.080
I am having a love affair with this ice
cream sandwich. Want some?

00:47.160 --> 00:49.000
- You wanna take a bite? Take a bite.
- Please. Please.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.480
- Come on. Take a bite. Bite.
- The S.E.C. has locked up our funds.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.760
- These guys aren't messing around.
- No touching!

00:54.840 --> 00:57.560
So I need you to tell me.
Were you taking vacations in the jet?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.640
Is that what you're hiding from me?

00:59.760 --> 01:03.120
I haven't had a vacation in years.
This is my vacation.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.519
I'm exercising.
I'm sleeping well.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.120
- You're doing time.
- I'm doing the time of my life!

01:10.240 --> 01:13.320
- What's up, pumpkin?
- Hey. T-Bone!

01:13.400 --> 01:15.240
- What's up?
- Yeah. T-Bone's my roommate.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.280
- Oh.
- He's a flamer.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.040
<i>- T's checking out today.
- Yeah.</i>

01:21.160 --> 01:23.400
Well, I guess every vacation's
gotta come to an end.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.640
You just made a fool out of yourself
in front ofT-Bone.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.320
Anyway, I want you to give him
a job at the company. Sales.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.240
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

01:35.320 --> 01:37.160
- Because we don't have any money.
- Because he's a flamer?

01:37.240 --> 01:38.400
- I told you that in confidence.

01:38.401 --> 01:40.720
- You don't seem to understand
I'm running this company now...

01:40.840 --> 01:43.480
and I need the flight records,
and I'm gonna get them...

01:43.600 --> 01:45.960
- with or without your help.
- All right.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.480
<i>No touching!</i>

01:49.560 --> 01:51.960
I got something we can try, all right?
It's a little risky.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.280
- Please.
- Open up.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.680
What do you mean about...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.880
<i>While George Sr. was losing a roommate...</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:03.920
<i>George Michael was having
a hard time adjusting to his new one.</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:05.840
Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.560
<i>- Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
- I'm up!</i>

02:07.640 --> 02:10.440
Okay, we are just about
ass to ankles back here, Maeby.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.400
Do you wanna hop on
your cousin's lap there, please?

02:14.840 --> 02:16.800
<i>Whoa, bumpy road ahead.</i>

02:22.000 --> 02:24.280
<i>So, he addressed his problem head-on.</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:27.240
Dad, I wanna work more hours
at the banana stand.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.080
Wow. Huh.
Well, that's great.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.640
You know, I used to be
just like you when I was a kid.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.040
<i>I used to love it there.
- It's gonna be our best summer ever, Mikey!</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna give you a promotion.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.320
Welcome aboard, Mr. Manager.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.440
Wow! I'm Mr. Manager!

02:46.560 --> 02:48.480
Well, manager.
We just say "manager. "

02:48.600 --> 02:51.640
<i>And you can hire an employee
if you need one.</i>

02:51.760 --> 02:54.720
- Do you think I need one?
- Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.280
Right. It's up to me now.
I'm Mr. Manager.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.360
- Manager. We just say...
- I know, but you just...

03:01.480 --> 03:03.360
It doesn't matter who.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.120
I don't know what I expected.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.520
What's going on? This is exactly where the
two of you were when I left this morning.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.200
- Is nobody gonna even try to get a job?
- I have a job, Michael.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.520
- It's called supporting my husband.
- You haven't been shopping.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.960
The only thing I found in the freezer
was a dead dove in a bag.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.600
<i>You didn't eat that, did you? 'Cause I've
only got a couple days left to return it.</i>

03:30.720 --> 03:33.640
<i>Died right in the middle
of a show.</i>

03:33.760 --> 03:37.240
- Do you want a cage for that?
- No. I'm a magician.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.680
What is your return policy,
by the way?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.320
<i>Not that I have to defend myself, but
for your information, I did go shopping.</i>

03:49.440 --> 03:51.720
You spent $68
on hair conditioner?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.560
A small price to pay
for self-esteem, Michael.

03:54.640 --> 03:58.440
Or are you still jealous that you lost Best
Hair to me in high school and got Dorkiest?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.520
<i>Lindsay's achievements in high school...</i>

04:00.640 --> 04:03.920
<i>had always overshadowed Michael's.</i>

04:04.040 --> 04:06.880
I agree with Michael. It's important
not to tie your self-esteem...

04:07.000 --> 04:09.480
into how you look or
what people think of you.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.600
I mean, look at me.
I'm an actor.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.280
An actor,
for crying out loud!

04:14.360 --> 04:17.800
You know how much rejection
I face every day?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.480
But in this business of show...

04:20.560 --> 04:22.960
you have to have the heart
of an angel...

04:23.080 --> 04:25.880
and the hide of an elephant.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.040
But you've never actually
had an audition.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.040
Well...

04:32.120 --> 04:35.400
excuse me!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.120
Excuse me.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.880
<i>Some really great spousal support.
You know something, Lindsay?</i>

04:44.000 --> 04:46.640
You might wanna start thinking about the
example you're setting for your daughter...

04:46.760 --> 04:48.680
unless you want her
to end up just like you.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.080
Yeah. Shoot me
when that happens.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.320
Is there a carbon monoxide leak
in this house?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.400
<i>George Michael, you're taking
your cousin to work today.</i>

04:59.520 --> 05:03.080
That's your new employee. I do not want my niece
to end up just like everyone in this family.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.720
Uh-uh. You're not telling my daughter
what to do. She's a child!

05:05.840 --> 05:08.720
No, I'm not. I can work.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.840
I don't know about this. I mean,
it can get pretty hairy in there.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.760
Fine. Do what you want.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.280
If I know my daughter,
that stand won't be there in a week.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.280
You stay on top of her, buddy.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.200
Do not be afraid
to ride her. Hard.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.120
<i>George Michael's attempt
to distance himself...</i>

05:32.240 --> 05:35.040
<i>from his cousin proved unsuccessful.</i>

05:40.520 --> 05:42.840
I can't tell you how many health codes
you're violating right now.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.840
I can't believe
I volunteered for this.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.120
This is my stupidest
rebellion ever.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.920
Hey, do you wanna
go play Skee-Ball?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.720
Wait... This is the cash drawer.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.640
My dad's gonna come by
at the end of the weekend...

05:55.760 --> 05:58.280
and the number of bananas has to match
the amount of money in here.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.840
- Oh, so it all has to even out?
- Exactly.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.320
Easy. Banana.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.360
Buck.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.960
Banana. Take a buck.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.480
<i>And Michael went to his mother
for the flight records...</i>

06:11.600 --> 06:13.800
<i>his father wouldn't give him.</i>

06:13.880 --> 06:17.760
<i>Then why don't you marry
an ice cream sandwich?</i>

06:17.840 --> 06:20.040
- I gotta go.
- Who was that? Was that Dad?

06:20.160 --> 06:23.080
- That was Gob.
- Uh-huh.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.360
- So, Mom, I'm trying to find...
- I don't know where they are.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.920
these flight records.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.960
You know, it's really more
believable if you let me finish.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.960
<i>Why am I the only one that seems to
get how much trouble this family is in?</i>

06:33.040 --> 06:35.680
Oh, I get it, Michael.
I get it.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.668
But how should I know
where the records are kept?

06:37.669 --> 06:39.080
Your father's in charge of all that.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.120
No, I'm in charge of all of that.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.480
And I think that you do know
where they are.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.720
Oh, it's probably all in
a storage unit somewhere.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.640
Where is the storage unit?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.560
- I don't remember.
- Try.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.320
Something with "Dale. "
I don't know. Brookfeather.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.640
<i>Raintree. It's hot.
It's very hot there.</i>

06:55.760 --> 06:58.160
- I've never been. Get a warrant!
- Don't think I won't.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.040
Mother... Mother, I care
about this family.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.880
And I do, too, my darling.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.880
That's why I'm worried about Gob. I was
on the phone with him this morning.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.800
You mean just now, right?
When I came in?

07:11.880 --> 07:15.840
Yes, just now, when you came in.
And he's upset. He's very upset.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.600
You haven't included him
in the business at all.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.440
He's your older brother.
You could find a little job for him.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.680
- Make him feel special.
- But he's not special, Mother.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.200
No.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.440
But he loves you.
We all love you.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.800
- Where's the storage unit?
- It's with your warrant.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.800
Luz, that coat cost
more than your house!

07:39.520 --> 07:42.600
Oh, that's how we joke.
She doesn't even have a house.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.800
<i>The next day, Tobias looked for work.</i>

07:47.920 --> 07:49.600
<i>Hmm. Actor Pull.</i>

07:54.240 --> 07:56.520
Ooh.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.520
Oh, look at all these parts!

08:03.880 --> 08:06.240
Tobias, nice to see you off the couch.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.960
<i>I was looking for work,
and I blew it, Michael.</i>

08:10.080 --> 08:12.480
I guess you've already
seen that, huh?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.960
Yes, I have.
Oh, right. This one.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.480
Yeah, I'll call them again,
I guess.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.800
I'll give them one more shot.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.040
<i>And that's when Michael
figured out how to get his mother...</i>

08:23.120 --> 08:26.920
<i>to lead him to the storage unit
where the flight records were kept.</i>

08:29.200 --> 08:31.600
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom, it's Michael. Listen.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.640
<i>Before I forget,
I talked to the I.R. S...</i>

08:33.760 --> 08:35.640
and they wanna come by
your apartment today...

08:35.760 --> 08:38.280
to see if you charged any
big-ticket stuff to the company.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.720
Furs or...

08:41.840 --> 08:43.559
I don't know.
just a heads-up.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.480
Oh, that poor woman.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.400
<i>So Michael followed Luz...</i>

08:53.480 --> 08:55.360
<i>who had been sent
to hide the evidence.</i>

08:55.440 --> 08:58.760
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias had arranged
an audition for a local commercial.</i>

08:58.840 --> 09:00.720
<i>Lindsay came along
to appear supportive.</i>

09:00.840 --> 09:04.720
- This could take a while.
- Honey, it's one line.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.760
Not if I do my job right.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.800
First of all, I love it.
Quick question though.

09:10.920 --> 09:15.560
Am I panicked about the fire,
or am I being brave for everyone else?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.760
The fire...
It's... It's a fire sale.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.840
Oh. Oh.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.760
Okay, I didn't, um...

09:25.840 --> 09:27.840
<i>Well, let's give it a shot.</i>

09:29.880 --> 09:33.720
Oh, my God!
We're having a fire... sale.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.120
Oh, the burning!
It burns me!

09:37.240 --> 09:40.360
<i>Evacuate all the schoolchildren!</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:45.200
? This isn't a fever!

09:45.320 --> 09:47.000
I can't even see
where the knob is!

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
And scene.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.160
Um...

10:00.240 --> 10:02.880
Would you like to try that
a little simpler maybe?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.120
No.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.800
Okay. Anybody else?
Anyone?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.920
Lindsay Bluth?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.840
- It's Fünke.
- Roger Danish.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.080
Look at you.
I can't believe it's Lindsay Bluth.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.560
- Oh!
- Fünke.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.280
Roger was my male counterpart
in high school.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.840
Remember how crazy
our hair was back then?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.760
What were we thinking?
So what are you doing now?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.960
- He's, uh, casting my commercial.
- Oh...

10:32.080 --> 10:35.160
Yeah, trying to. The South Coast
Boutique is having a fire sale.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.680
South Coast Boutique?
They're having a fire sale?

10:43.200 --> 10:47.320
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was
still following his mother's housekeeper.</i>

10:52.480 --> 10:56.040
<i>And she did finally
lead him to the storage unit.</i>

10:56.160 --> 10:59.240
<i>Unfortunately, it was on fire.</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:06.520
Somebody wanted this place to go.

11:06.640 --> 11:11.080
- Yeah? What do you mean, arson?
- Oh, definitely the work of a flamer.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.920
It shoots tomorrow,
and are you ready for this?

11:35.040 --> 11:39.560
- It pays 1,000 bucks!
- Mmm. I thought that was Tobias's part.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.840
Yes. No. No,
I did not book this one.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.520
I, uh... I think I made the,
uh, fire too real, uh, for them...

11:45.640 --> 11:48.480
and, uh... and probably failed
to highlight the sale.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.800
<i>So, good for her.
And, uh, will you excuse me, please?</i>

11:55.600 --> 11:57.600
Well, that's great,
but I've got my own problems.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.840
The flight records?
They burned up.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.560
That's fine. That's over with.
But I think Dad is behind it.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.640
I think Dad is trying
to run the business from prison.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.800
<i>Well, isn't that ironic?
I'm making a fortune at my newjob...</i>

12:09.880 --> 12:12.120
and you don't even have
the job you thought you did.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.720
But you don't have a job. You've got a
job offer. Anybody can get a job offer.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.760
So, I'm gonna go see Dad,
because this is my business to run now.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.160
Your business?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.480
Hey, there you are, Gob.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.720
I have been looking all over for you.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.120
I could really use some help.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.960
Well, I was gonna return this dove.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.760
What are you... You want me to run
a meeting for you or something?

12:40.880 --> 12:43.680
Or, even better,
could you mail this letter for me?

12:43.760 --> 12:46.360
You can't just give that
to a mailman?

12:46.440 --> 12:49.800
I can't trust a mailman with this.
This is important.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.280
<i>Gob was intrigued.
He also suspected...</i>

12:52.400 --> 12:55.080
<i>he couldn't return a completely
frozen dove to a pet store...</i>

12:55.160 --> 12:57.920
<i>and get the full refund
he felt he was entitled to.</i>

12:58.000 --> 13:01.560
<i>I'll mail that letter.
- Michael then went to confront his father.</i>

13:03.120 --> 13:05.800
You are not going to keep
running the company from in here, okay?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.480
That's why you wanted me
to give T-Bone a job?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.987
- To pay him back for
burning down the storage unit?

13:09.988 --> 13:11.360
- Michael, that's ridiculous.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.360
Well, I'm not hiring him. No.
We don't have the money, Pop.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.920
There's always money in the banana stand.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.560
The banana stand! You know, that's
exactly what this feels like. Huh?

13:21.640 --> 13:24.600
Like I'm still stuck in that hot booth
all summer with you pulling the strings.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.480
What was I gonna do, put a kid in charge
of a frozen banana stand?

13:27.560 --> 13:29.960
Sure. That's what I did.
I just made my son the manager.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.280
George Michael is running
the frozen banana stand now?

13:34.400 --> 13:38.880
That's right. Yeah. You sit with that.
You think about that for a while.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.240
<i>George Sr. did think about that.</i>

13:45.040 --> 13:47.960
Well, now that we've got an employee,
we can go have dinner.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.280
We throw away a banana for every buck
we take so no one finds out.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.680
Wait a minute.
I think you should do that math again.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.520
- Why? Is it wrong?
- It's fine.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.920
He's an arsonist, not an embezzler.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.080
<i>Meanwhile, Michael got
an urgent call from his mother.</i>

14:06.160 --> 14:08.280
Gob is unhappy.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.840
Again? I tried to include him.
I gave him a job.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.280
- You gave him a letter to mail.
- Don't tell me that was too much for him.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.480
No, Michael, he mailed the letter.
That's not the point.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.680
<i>Gob had not mailed the letter,
but, in an act of defiance...</i>

14:20.760 --> 14:23.040
<i>dramatically hurled the letter
into the sea.</i>

14:25.560 --> 14:29.280
<i>This proved a more difficult dramatic
gesture than he'd anticipated.</i>

14:41.200 --> 14:43.680
- So what do you want me to do about it?
- Don't take that tone.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.000
He's my son.
I want you to make him stop calling me.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.520
<i>Am I the only one
who works in this family?</i>

14:50.600 --> 14:53.360
<i>Yes, that's my gal.</i>

14:53.480 --> 14:56.720
Who would have imagined... two actors
in one family?

14:56.840 --> 14:59.160
We're like the Lunts!

14:59.240 --> 15:04.760
- You see... Excuse me.
- Mama.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.440
<i>And so, Lindsay and Maeby
separately went to the same restaurant...</i>

15:08.520 --> 15:11.160
<i>to celebrate thejobs
they hadn't actually performed...</i>

15:11.240 --> 15:13.640
<i>with money they
hadn't actually earned.</i>

15:13.760 --> 15:16.600
Did you enjoy your meal, Mom?
You drank it fast enough.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.080
<i>- Hi, Lucille!
- Not as much as you enjoyed yours.</i>

15:19.160 --> 15:21.000
You want your belt to buckle,
not your chair.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.000
Okay, this is what I
told Tobias you'd do.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.760
Say what you will about him.
At least he's happy for me.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.360
You know, I think we might
be doubling our losses here.

15:34.440 --> 15:38.040
Because, I mean, for every dollar you
take, you're actually taking two dollars...

15:38.120 --> 15:40.440
because we paid for the bananas.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.560
Oh, my God, you're right.

15:42.680 --> 15:47.520
I am? Oh, God, I've screwed this up!
Okay, we gotta go.

15:47.640 --> 15:52.600
<i>- Oh, my God! It's your mom and Gangy.
- What are they doing here?</i>

15:52.680 --> 15:54.520
They're grown-ups. They're allowed
to have fun whenever they want.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.440
We're kids. We're supposed to be working.
Now they're gonna tell my dad...

15:57.520 --> 15:59.760
and he's gonna come check the totals
and know we took the money.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.652
- Oh, God, this is bad.
What are we gonna do?

16:01.653 --> 16:01.960
- Look.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.440
Pop-pop, he's a business man.
What would he do?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.440
Bananas Foster.

16:12.760 --> 16:16.320
You might wanna let that fire go out
before you stick your face in it.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.600
That's funny, 'cause I was gonna say,
"You might wanna lean away from that fire...

16:18.680 --> 16:21.240
since you're soaked in alcohol. "

16:21.320 --> 16:23.960
Mine was better.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.880
Welcome to Bluth Bananas,
where bananas are our business.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.800
May I interest you
in a banana this day?

16:27.880 --> 16:31.960
- T-Bone, what are you doing here?
- Your dad gave me this job.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.360
<i>Michael realized that his father
had even taken control...</i>

16:35.440 --> 16:37.400
<i>of the banana stand.</i>

16:37.480 --> 16:39.320
<i>But he still had some
unanswered questions...</i>

16:39.400 --> 16:41.160
<i>so he did
a little detective work.</i>

16:41.240 --> 16:43.080
- You burn down the storage unit?
- Oh, most definitely.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.000
Michael, having a nice day
at the beach...

16:51.080 --> 16:54.040
while the rest of us are busting
our asses to deliver your mail?

16:54.120 --> 16:57.320
What do you want me to say?
You go and complain to Mom...

16:57.440 --> 16:59.520
- and I tried to include you.
- Include me?

16:59.600 --> 16:59.905
- Yeah.

16:59.906 --> 17:02.040
- I should be in charge.
I'm the older brother.

17:02.120 --> 17:06.520
- Please, do you even wanna be in charge?
- No! But I'd like to be asked.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.839
This is just like when we were kids,
and you were the only one...

17:08.960 --> 17:11.839
- he let work in the banana stand.
- Well, I got news for you.

17:11.960 --> 17:15.000
Dad still doesn't trust me to this day.
He treats me like a low-level employee.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.079
Better than being treated
like the goofball...

17:18.160 --> 17:20.760
the joker, the magician.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.000
I thought you were gonna do,
like, a trick there.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.920
- A fireball or something.
- I was. It didn't go off.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.840
These things never go
off when you want them to.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.160
- My least consistent trick.
- Hang on one sec. Hello.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.120
- Hey, Uncle Michael, it's me, Maeby.
- Where's George Michael?

17:34.240 --> 17:38.680
At the banana stand. He's about to do
something really irresponsible.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.440
<i>You think it's irresponsible?
I'll be right there.</i>

17:42.880 --> 17:46.000
<i>- I'm gonna get blamed for this.
- George Michael.</i>

17:46.120 --> 17:48.040
- Dad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

17:48.160 --> 17:52.600
I was just, uh...
I was burning down the banana stand.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.320
- What?
- I'm sorry. I screwed it all up.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.240
I've got no right to
call myself Mr. Manager.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.080
- Manager.
- Manager. I'm sorry, Dad.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.120
- Oh, George Michael.
- I am. But I'll make it up to you.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.880
I'll work weeknights.
I'll lay people off.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.720
I'll give up my summer,
all my summers.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.720
just just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

18:07.800 --> 18:12.120
<i>Michael realized he had done to his
son what his father had done to him...</i>

18:12.200 --> 18:14.520
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

18:14.600 --> 18:17.440
- Burn it down.
- What?

18:17.520 --> 18:20.240
Let's burn this son of a bitch.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.800
This is gonna be
our best summer ever, buddy.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.320
<i>And so, Michael, his son
and his brother together enjoyed...</i>

18:40.400 --> 18:42.600
<i>the cathartic burning
of the banana stand.</i>

18:42.720 --> 18:45.800
You mailed that
insurance check, right, Gob?

19:00.200 --> 19:02.320
<i>The next morning,
Lindsay woke up late in the day...</i>

19:02.440 --> 19:04.520
<i>hungover from celebrating
her one day of employment...</i>

19:04.640 --> 19:07.200
<i>which, it turns out,
she had slept through.</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:09.760
All right, Lindsay, forget it.
We'll get someone else.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.960
<i>Tobias was next on the call list...</i>

19:12.040 --> 19:13.880
<i>but, unfortunately,
couldn't hear the phone...</i>

19:13.960 --> 19:17.440
<i>over the sound of the shower.</i>

19:17.520 --> 19:19.200
<i>He did, however,
use Lindsay's conditioner...</i>

19:19.280 --> 19:22.440
- and was surprised to find that it
did help his self-esteem. - Mornin'.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.960
- You look nice.
- What?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.880
You look
very handsome today.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.760
Thank you, Lindsay.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.480
<i>And Michael finally got to show
his father who's boss.</i>

19:33.560 --> 19:36.200
- You what?
- Burned it right down to the ground.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.640
Are you crazy?
There was money in that banana stand.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.600
Well, it's all gone now, Dad,
and it was my decision.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.640
So the next time you wanna have
a little power struggle...

19:44.760 --> 19:47.000
just remember that
you're playing with fire.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.320
There was $250,000 lining the walls
of the banana stand.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.440
- What?
- Cash, Michael.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.240
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- How much clearer can I say...

19:57.320 --> 20:01.120
"There's always money
in the banana stand"?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.040
- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!

20:03.120 --> 20:05.400
<i>- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!</i>

20:05.480 --> 20:07.800
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

20:07.880 --> 20:11.560
<i>Gob protests the pet store's
frozen dove exchange policy.</i>

20:11.640 --> 20:14.080
Return from whence you came!

20:14.200 --> 20:16.160
<i>And, Michael, realizing
the banana stand...</i>

20:16.280 --> 20:19.480
<i>is the only profitable part
of the Bluth empire, decides to rebuild.</i>

20:19.560 --> 20:23.000
You couldn't have called me?
I can't swing a hammer?

20:24.440 --> 20:27.960
I got a rabbit to buy.
