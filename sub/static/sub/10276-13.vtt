01:03.730 --> 01:06.665
( squealing, laughing )

01:06.667 --> 01:09.401
I can't stop spinning!

01:09.403 --> 01:11.470
( giggling )

01:16.042 --> 01:18.744
Lovely enchanted
ice dancing, girls.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.513
Impressive work
for our very first lesson.

01:21.515 --> 01:25.350
Thanks, but...I'm not
getting the hang of the flips.

01:25.352 --> 01:28.253
Or spins. Or--
JAMES: Look out!

01:28.255 --> 01:30.055
Sorry about that!
James,

01:30.057 --> 01:34.226
we <i> told </i> you, this side
of the rink is for
ice dancing class.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.361
That side is
for hockey practice.

01:36.363 --> 01:39.198
Sorry, Amber. We're not used
to sharing the rink either.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.067
Hey, James! We can't play
without the puck!

01:42.069 --> 01:43.302
Coming!

01:46.372 --> 01:49.408
Okay, then, let's learn
a new move.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.810
The Stargarzer Spin.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.957
Now, you try.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.660
Oh!

02:09.729 --> 02:11.196
Ah!

02:13.566 --> 02:15.534
Uhh! Ohh...

02:19.439 --> 02:22.307
Hey!
Sorry, Hugo.
You snooze you lose.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.814
I <i> never </i> lose, Derek.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.752
Take that!

02:33.754 --> 02:35.120
Score!
Whoa!

02:35.122 --> 02:37.222
Nice shot, Hugo.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.496
Okay, let's try that again.

02:47.934 --> 02:51.103
Waaa...waaaaah!

02:51.105 --> 02:54.506
Hey, Sofia,
this is <i> our </i> side of the rink!

02:58.478 --> 03:00.612
You okay, Sofia?
Yeah.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.016
Sorry, guys.
That's a <i> really </i> hard move.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.551
Look on the bright side.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.387
If you were a hockey puck,
you would have scored.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.989
Miss Flora, I don't think
this rink-sharing idea

03:10.991 --> 03:12.357
is gonna work after all.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.959
You're right, Sir Henley.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.995
I'll find a new place for
the ice dancing class.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.964
You can have the ice
for the rest of the day.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.799
I'll take the boys for a run.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.168
"Work today, win tomorrow,"
I always say.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.336
Come along, lads.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.071
( all groan )

03:29.509 --> 03:33.912
Okay, girls,
now let's work on
our Fireball Flips.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.927
Whoa!

03:51.331 --> 03:52.764
Hugo?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.666
Shouldn't you be
with the hockey team?

03:54.668 --> 03:57.769
I'll go in a minute.
Those flips look really fun.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.672
They are. Even when
you're not doing them right.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.507
Do you want to try?
No way.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.843
I don't know <i> any </i> boys
who ice dance.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.013
That's because
enchanted ice dancing
is too hard for boys.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.082
You'd probably just
fall flat on your face.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.518
Ha! Not a chance.
I'm the best skater
on the hockey team.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.853
Then it'll be easy for you.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.455
Okay, fine. I'll try it.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.925
Miss Flora, can you give Hugo
a pair of enchanted skates?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.593
Absolutely!

04:24.030 --> 04:25.564
So how do these things work?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.399
Do I just jump? Whoa!

04:27.401 --> 04:30.235
Try a flip!
Sofia, he won't be able
to do a flip.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.104
He's just starting out.
Uh, Amber?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.171
Look up.

04:35.541 --> 04:36.875
Ha ha!

04:36.877 --> 04:39.278
That's a <i> triple </i> Fireball Flip.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.047
I've never seen
a student do that!

04:42.049 --> 04:43.649
Hugo is incredible!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.787
That was awesome.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.422
You should join our class,
Hugo.

04:50.424 --> 04:54.059
We do have an extra spot.
I can't.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.228
Ice dancing isn't for boys.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.063
It's for anyone who
wants to do it.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.998
But there are no boys
in the class.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.235
There were no girls
on the flying derby team
until I joined,

05:03.237 --> 05:05.470
but I loved it so much
I did it anyway.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.174
So you'll be
the only boy in the class.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.610
If you really like ice dancing,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.078

Hugo! Miss Flora said
to meet at the pond
for ice dancing class today.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.066
You're taking <i> ice dancing?</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:16.701
Isn't that for <i> girls?</i>

07:16.703 --> 07:19.905
Yeah. Which is exactly why
I'm <i> not </i> taking it.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.239
But wait. You said--

07:21.241 --> 07:23.041
Can I talk to you
for a second?

07:23.043 --> 07:26.211
I don't get it. I thought you
were taking the class with us.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.881
I <i> am. </i> But I can't
let my friends find out
or they'll laugh at me.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.284
But they're going to notice
you're not at hockey practice.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.552
It meets at the same time.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.421
Right. I didn't think
about that.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.390
I know. I'll tell 'em
I got sick.

07:38.392 --> 07:41.393
But you're not sick.
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.894
Hey, guys.

07:42.896 --> 07:43.962
( "coughs" )

07:43.964 --> 07:45.730
I don't think
I can practice today.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.966
I just started
feeling <i> really </i> sick.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.136
Sounds like
you've got it <i> bad.</i>

07:51.138 --> 07:52.571
Hope you feel better soon.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.539
Oh, so do I.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.310
See ya later, guys.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.116
I don't get it.
Where are we supposed to skate?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.018
Right here.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.493
I froze the ice solid
so it's perfectly safe
to skate on.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.362
Class, I have some good news.

08:17.364 --> 08:21.666
We're going to put on
an ice dancing recital
for the whole school!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.368
Oh!
Mm!

08:23.370 --> 08:26.137
You mean everyone
is gonna see me skating
with all you girls?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.840
Yes! Next Friday at three.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.010
Ohh, good. It's the same time
as hockey practice,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.378
so the guys won't see me.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.314
For the recital, you're all
going to pair up

08:36.316 --> 08:38.183
and work on a routine.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.318
Do you want to skate together?
Sure.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.888
Great. Let's figure out
what moves we're going to do.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.456
Come on.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.792
Maybe we could start
with the Stargazer Spin
Miss Flora taught us.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.665
Whoa...whoooaah!

08:53.667 --> 08:55.133
That's pretty good.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.868
But why stop
after one spin?

09:01.474 --> 09:05.143
Ah...I don't think
I can do that.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.678
Sure you can!

09:06.680 --> 09:09.748
Just get some speed,
then push off with your legs
really hard

09:09.750 --> 09:11.182
so you can kick into the spin.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.452
Okay. Uh...uh...

09:15.888 --> 09:17.589
Whooooah!

09:20.760 --> 09:22.527
I can't believe it!

09:22.529 --> 09:24.930
I thought I'd never
get that move! Thank you!

09:24.932 --> 09:26.264
No problem.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.567
That's all for today, class.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.536
Um, I still can't do
that Fireball Flip.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.505
I wish we could
practice more.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.740
Well, there's an ice rink
at my castle.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.809
Can we go?
Sure.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.445
HUGO: Here we are.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.248
Wow, this is perfect.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.617
Hugo!
Dad?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.085
What are you doing out here?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.554
I thought I'd see
what you were up to, champ.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.556
We were just ice dan--
Playing ice hockey.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.425
I was showing Sofia
some hockey moves.

09:53.427 --> 09:57.195
Well, <i> I </i> can help with that!
That's okay, Dad.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.031
You know, Sofia,
I was quite the hockey pro

10:00.033 --> 10:01.866
when I was at Royal Prep.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.868
Let me borrow
your skates, Hugo.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.903
What?! No!

10:04.905 --> 10:07.372
Back in my day,
this was the move

10:07.374 --> 10:09.874
that made me
the Big Prince On Campus.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.077
Now, first you swerve
to one side--

10:12.079 --> 10:13.612
Aaaahh!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.814
Whoa! Whoooah!

10:17.416 --> 10:20.251
What are you doing
with <i> ice dancing </i> skates, Hugo?

10:20.253 --> 10:23.388
Uh, Sofia's must have got
mixed up with mine by mistake.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.890
Oh! Of course!

10:25.892 --> 10:28.393
For a minute I thought
you had taken up ice dancing.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.562
But we all know
that's for girls. Ha ha!

10:30.564 --> 10:32.931
I know <i> some </i> boys
who ice dance.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.899
Well, not the boys
in <i> our </i> family.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.602
We only do rugged sports,
like flying derby,

10:37.604 --> 10:39.838
shove ball, and ice hockey.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.673
How about I go get
a pair of stakes

10:41.675 --> 10:43.108
and we all play
a little hockey right now?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.910
Um, Sofia and I were
just about to go inside.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.912
That's all right,
we can play some darts.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.581
Or armor wrestling.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.850
I don't think Sofia
wants to armor wrestle, Dad.

10:51.852 --> 10:55.353
Or anything you want to do.
I just want to spend some time
with my boy.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.822
Sure, sounds good.
Right after Sofia leaves.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.759
O-Okay, then.
See ya later, champ.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.597
Whoo! That was a close call.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.967
Maybe you should just tell him
that you really like
ice dancing.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.136
No way! You heard him.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.105
He said the boys in our family
don't ice dance.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.174
Let's just practice.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.148
We have to figure out
the rest of our routine today.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.451
Okay. I was thinking
we should end with
the Spinning Dragon.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.787
But no one in class
can do that move.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.156
Then we'll be the first.
DAD: Hugo!

11:31.158 --> 11:33.792
There you are, champ!
Oh, hello, Princess Sofia.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.061
Dad! Why are <i> you </i> here?

11:36.063 --> 11:39.064
I found a way we can have
more father-son time!

11:39.066 --> 11:43.501
I asked Sir Henley if I can be
the assistant hockey coach,
and he said yes!

11:43.503 --> 11:47.739
So from now on,
I'll be right by your side
at all your practices.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.840
Every one?!

11:48.842 --> 11:50.809
Every single one!

11:50.811 --> 11:54.145
Staring right now.
Come on, champ!

11:54.147 --> 11:55.847
Sorry, I have to go.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.849
What about ice dancing?
DAD: Hugo!

11:57.851 --> 11:58.983
What's the holdup?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.318
I'll be right there, Dad.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.020
Don't worry.
I'm gonna do both.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.155
But the classes meet
at the same time.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.523
I'll just run back and forth.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.192
I don't think
that's going to work.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.993
You haven't seen
how fast I run.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.963
( sighs ) Boys.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.069
You're better already,
Hugo?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.904
Yep.
Wow, that was quick.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.647
Thattaboy, Hugo!
Now shoot!

12:32.051 --> 12:34.686
Sorry about that.
I'll get it.

12:34.688 --> 12:37.088
How you gonna find the puck
in all that snow?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.624
Ah, you're right.
It could take me a while.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.026
Keep playing without me.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.464
I'm here. What did I miss?

12:46.466 --> 12:49.300
A lot. Miss Flora helped me
figure out the rest
of our routine.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.870
Great! Can you show it to me
really fast?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.972
I have to go back to hockey
in a few minutes.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.374
That's not enough time
to go through the whole thing.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.876
Especially if you
keep talking.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.311
Okay. We're going to begin
with the Stargazer Spin,

13:00.313 --> 13:01.713
go right into
the Royal Round-Off,

13:01.715 --> 13:04.149
then do a Fireball Flip, if
I can figure out how to do it.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.051
Then--
Why don't you start
practicing your spins?

13:07.053 --> 13:09.487
Hugo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

13:09.489 --> 13:11.856
Ahh!
And I'll be back
before you know it.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.731
Uh, Hugo,
where's the puck?

13:19.733 --> 13:22.767
You were right.
I couldn't find it
in all that snow.

13:22.769 --> 13:23.868
Heads up!

13:25.237 --> 13:27.972
Goal!
Crushed it! Yeah!

13:33.412 --> 13:35.079
Uh...

13:35.081 --> 13:36.114
crushed it?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.248
What was <i> that?</i>

13:37.250 --> 13:39.651
Uh, my-my blades just slipped.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.486
I better go sharpen them.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.960
Whoooah!

13:48.962 --> 13:50.428
Gotcha!

13:50.430 --> 13:53.264
I'm never going to get the hang
of that Fireball Flip.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.099
Let's do another move instead.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.935
Uh-uh. I'm not letting you
give up.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.604
Try it again, but stay
in your tuck a second longer.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.006
I'll do it with you. Come on.
Okay.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.780
That's it! Great job, Sofia.

14:08.782 --> 14:11.182
Thanks. Now the next part
of our routine--

14:11.184 --> 14:12.684
You can show me
when I get back.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.853
How long can you keep
doing this?

14:14.855 --> 14:17.121
As long as I have to!

14:17.123 --> 14:18.990
( chanting )
Work today, win tomorrow!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.359
Work today,
win tomorrow!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.895
Work today, win tomorrow...

14:35.474 --> 14:37.141
Looking good, you two!

14:37.143 --> 14:40.211
Looks like we're almost ready
for tomorrow's recital.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.047
Now, who wants to warm up
with some hot cocoa?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.649
Yes, please!

14:44.651 --> 14:47.485
I should keep working on
my Fireball Flip.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.089
It's getting better, but try
starting your flip sooner,
like this.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.996
HOCKEY TEAM:
...win tomorrow!
Work today,

14:57.998 --> 14:59.197
win tomorrow--

14:59.199 --> 15:00.331
Hugo?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.100
Oh no. Guys,

15:02.102 --> 15:03.768
what are you doing here?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.271
Are you <i> ice dancing?!</i>

15:06.273 --> 15:08.740
He sure is.
No, I'm not, Sofia!

15:08.742 --> 15:10.341
Why would I be
doing <i> that?</i>

15:10.343 --> 15:13.211
Uh, somehow these
enchanted skates got
mixed up with mine,

15:13.213 --> 15:16.014
and then I got lost
and thought the pond
was the ice rink,

15:16.016 --> 15:17.448
and did I mention
I bumped my head?

15:19.118 --> 15:21.119
Hugo, they <i> saw </i> you.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.390
Okay, guys. The thing is,

15:25.392 --> 15:28.426
I kinda joined
the ice dancing class.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.263
So <i> that's </i> why you keep
disappearing in the middle
of practice.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.199
Why would you want
to play a girl's sport
instead of hockey?

15:35.201 --> 15:38.536
I like hockey,
I just like ice dancing more.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.071
Go ahead, make fun of me.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.906
Okay. I'll go first.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.408
Hold on, Derek.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.376
I think it's great
Hugo's ice dancing.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.045
You do?
You <i> do?</i>

15:47.047 --> 15:49.881
Sure! I think boys
an ice dance if they want,

15:49.883 --> 15:51.783
just like girls can play hockey
if they want.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.419
Who says we can't all
just play whatever we like?

15:54.421 --> 15:55.520
What's the big deal?

15:56.722 --> 15:58.156
ALL: I don't know.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.991
I guess there isn't one.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.261
If you like ice dancing, Hugo,
that's okay with me.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.595
Me too.
Me too.
Me too.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.597
Ah. Thanks, guys.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.067
But listen, I can't
let my dad find out.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.803
Will you tell him
I had to miss practice
because I'm not feeling well?

16:11.805 --> 16:15.006
We'll tell him, Hugo.
Good luck.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.408
Work today, win tomorrow!

16:17.410 --> 16:18.609
Work today, win...

16:18.611 --> 16:21.446
See that? Your friends
didn't make fun of you.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.114
You were worried
for no reason.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.983
Yeah. I can't believe it.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.851
So then why won't you
tell your dad?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.453
He might be okay with it, too.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.822
No way, Sofia.
You don't know my dad.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.256
He'll never be okay with it.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.659
Come on. Let's work
on our round-offs.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.599
Hey, Sofia.
Hi, Hugo.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.601
Ready for the recital?
Yeah.

16:43.603 --> 16:47.138
Just remember, when you spin,
tilt your head way back.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.773
Like this.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.874
Hugo!

16:50.843 --> 16:52.310
Dad?!
I'm glad

16:52.312 --> 16:53.778
to see
you're feeling better.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.680
We need you at the rink.
Come on, champ.

16:56.648 --> 16:57.682
Okay, Dad.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.517
Hugo, tell him!

16:59.519 --> 17:00.685
Tell me what, champ?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.455
Sofia's doing
an ice dancing recital.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.325
DAD: And I'm sure she
and the other princesses

17:07.327 --> 17:08.693
will do a wonderful job.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.528
Now let's go play hockey,
m'boy!

17:10.530 --> 17:11.963
Sorry.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.865
( sighs )

17:19.171 --> 17:21.305
Oh, there you are, Sofia.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.673
Where's Hugo?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.375
He's not coming, Miss Flora.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.743
He's playing hockey.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.245
Why?
No!

17:27.247 --> 17:29.814
Oh, dear!
He really wants to be here,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.916
but his dad wants him
to play hockey.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.319
It is a shame that Prince Hugo
won't be joining us.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.155
But the show must go on.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.657
Amber and Maya
will perform first.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.492
Then Lakshmi and Cleo.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.995
Sofia, you'll have to
dance alone.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.531
But I know you'll do
just fine.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.967
Now let's warm up
before our audience arrives.

18:02.014 --> 18:06.350
Princess Sofia,
that triple Fireball Flip
was fantastic!

18:06.352 --> 18:08.920
Thanks! Hugo really
helped me with it.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.956
He wouldn't give up until
I got it just right.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.724
Sofia, what is it?

18:13.726 --> 18:16.060
Hugo. He wouldn't give up on me,

18:16.062 --> 18:18.996
so I'm not going to
give up on him.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.070
That's my boy.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.605
( sighs )

18:27.607 --> 18:29.273
Shouldn't you be
at your recital?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.809
I wish I was,
but my dad dragged me here.

18:33.579 --> 18:38.249
( cheers, applause )
Welcome to our
ice dancing recital.

18:38.251 --> 18:42.720
Up first are Princess Maya
and Princess Amber.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.760
Sofia, what are you
doing here?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.663
You should be at the recital.
So should <i> you.</i>

18:57.769 --> 18:59.270
Someone stop her!

18:59.272 --> 19:02.306
This is ice hockey,
not ice dancing!

19:02.308 --> 19:04.742
Stop! Everyone's
staring at you.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.145
I don't care. I love ice dancing

19:07.147 --> 19:10.515
and I'm not going to let anyone
stop me from doing what I love.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.017
And neither should you.
Are you with me?

19:18.924 --> 19:21.125
Dad, I know you don't
want to hear this,

19:21.127 --> 19:23.161
but I love ice dancing.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.863
What?!
I've been practicing for weeks.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.298
I like it more than hockey.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.000
This can't be!

19:29.002 --> 19:32.336
The men in our family
don't ice dance!

19:32.338 --> 19:34.939
They do now.
There's an ice dancing recital,

19:34.941 --> 19:36.007
and I'm going.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.108
Sorry, Dad,.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.177
Huh?

19:39.179 --> 19:42.280
Come on, Sofia.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.582
Hugo, stop!

19:45.784 --> 19:47.151
Come on, guys,

19:47.153 --> 19:49.053
don't you want to
see Hugo ice dance?

19:58.497 --> 20:00.998
( cheers, applause )

20:01.000 --> 20:03.968
Oh, good.
You're just in time.

20:03.970 --> 20:08.005
Miss Flora, can you give Hugo
a pair of enchanted skates
and a costume?

20:08.007 --> 20:09.941
Oh, absolutely.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.718
MISS FLORA:
Our next ice dancers
are Princess Sofia

20:20.720 --> 20:23.321
and Prince Hugo!

20:43.542 --> 20:45.409
Go, Hugo!
Go, Sofia!

20:47.279 --> 20:49.347
Let's do an extra Fireball Flip.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.249
A quadruple?
You can do it!

20:58.957 --> 21:02.093
I've never seen anyone
do so many flips before!

21:02.095 --> 21:05.930
King Derek, your son
is the best ice dancer
I've ever seen!

21:05.932 --> 21:08.399
And I've judged at least
a dozen competitions.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.934
You have? He is?

21:32.424 --> 21:34.292

Great job, Hugo.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.732
You too, Sofia.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.102
Hugo!

21:45.104 --> 21:46.904
Uh-oh.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.743
Hugo, that was...outstanding!

21:52.745 --> 21:55.613
You're not mad at me?
I'm furious!

21:55.615 --> 21:58.582
But only because you
should have told me sooner

21:58.584 --> 22:00.418
how good you are at this!

22:00.420 --> 22:02.753
But you said ice dancing
was just for girls.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.589
Well, that's what I thought
until I saw how much fun
you were having

22:05.591 --> 22:07.625
and how great you are at it!

22:07.627 --> 22:10.261
Come here, champ!
I'm proud of you.

22:10.263 --> 22:11.295
Thanks, Dad.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.097
Excuse me! Miss Flora.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.665
You don't by any chance

22:14.667 --> 22:17.101
need an assistant
ice dancing coach, do you?

22:17.103 --> 22:18.602
Um, well...

22:18.604 --> 22:21.605
Hey, Hugo! Can you teach me
how to do those cool flips?

22:21.607 --> 22:23.274
Yeah, me too!

22:23.276 --> 22:24.942
Can they all try,
Miss Flora?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.944
What an excellent idea.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.180
Aaah!
This is awesome!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.450
I'm glad you got me
to try ice dancing.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.352
And I'm glad
you're still doing it.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.320
My Royal Round-Offs
needs some work.

They sure do.
