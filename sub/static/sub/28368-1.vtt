Thank you, I do love applause

01:33.159 --> 01:34.591
but just throw money next time.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.294
Oh, good evening,
my beautiful kings

01:38.296 --> 01:39.329
and queens.

01:39.331 --> 01:40.564
Look, if you want to take

01:40.566 --> 01:41.865
a photograph, take it now.

01:41.867 --> 01:44.504
Because this is
as good as I get.

01:45.703 --> 01:48.772
It's very unprofessional
to drink on stage,

01:48.774 --> 01:50.407
so could you help me down?

01:51.609 --> 01:52.708
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.243
Oh, you're lovely.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.580
Cheers. Hmm.

01:57.582 --> 02:01.184
Oh, that's fucking better.

02:01.186 --> 02:03.553
Is there any lesbians here?

02:03.555 --> 02:07.223
Lesbi... Oooh, yes, yes.

02:07.225 --> 02:10.526
How long
have you known each other?

02:10.527 --> 02:13.729
20 minutes? Did I offend you?

02:13.731 --> 02:15.364
Thank fuck for that.

02:16.401 --> 02:22.205
Oooh, hello, big boy.

02:22.207 --> 02:25.942
Tell me something, if
I had a rooster and you had a donkey,

02:25.944 --> 02:28.345
and your donkey
hit my rooster, what

02:28.347 --> 02:30.346
what would you have? Hmm?

02:30.348 --> 02:31.514
My cock in your ass.

02:32.985 --> 02:36.453
Oh, I do love
a dirty audience.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.887
Are you two together?

02:37.889 --> 02:38.922
No shit.

02:38.924 --> 02:41.725
Um... Oh, hello.

02:41.727 --> 02:44.393
Are you alone? Oh, dear.

02:44.395 --> 02:46.262
Do you
know the difference

02:46.264 --> 02:48.665
between erotic and kinky?

02:48.667 --> 02:52.735
Let's see, an erotic person
uses a feather,

02:52.737 --> 02:56.472
and the kinky person uses
a whole fucking chicken.

02:57.842 --> 03:01.945
Oh, oh, sorry, boys,
he looks better.

03:01.947 --> 03:05.485
Oh, tell me something, big boy.

03:06.451 --> 03:07.984
Are you gay?

03:07.986 --> 03:09.919
Wait, you're straight?

03:09.921 --> 03:12.891
So is spaghetti
until it gets hot and wet.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.592
Is there a married couple here?

03:16.594 --> 03:18.661
Oh, oh, yes.

03:18.663 --> 03:21.430
You look married to me.

03:21.432 --> 03:23.633
How quaint. Tell me something,

03:23.635 --> 03:25.935
do you know
the difference between

03:25.937 --> 03:28.405
your job and your wife?

03:28.407 --> 03:31.007
After five years
your job will still suck.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.011
Sorry, darling.

03:34.013 --> 03:37.547
You know
why men are like motorcars?

03:37.549 --> 03:39.382
Because they always
pull out before

03:39.384 --> 03:41.550
checking to see if
anybody else is coming.

03:43.822 --> 03:47.326
Oh, you see,
darlings, I'm not fat.

03:48.426 --> 03:50.526
I'm just easier to see.

05:48.509 --> 05:50.144
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Collins.

05:51.978 --> 05:54.512
Is there someone
I can call for you?

05:54.514 --> 05:59.183
- Family? Friends?
- Pardon?

05:59.185 --> 06:00.851
You have
any family or friends

06:00.853 --> 06:02.753
I could call for you?

06:02.755 --> 06:06.092
No, I've...
no family, no friends.

06:08.028 --> 06:09.060
I understand.

06:09.062 --> 06:10.529
This must have come

06:10.531 --> 06:11.566
as quite a shock.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.168
Yes, you could say that.

06:17.603 --> 06:22.242
Um, how long...
How long have I got?

06:24.110 --> 06:25.879
It's hard to say.

06:27.247 --> 06:29.016
Maybe six, seven weeks.

06:31.651 --> 06:34.254
Got an expiry date like
a piece of fucking chicken.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.692
You have an aggressive
form of cancer, mister Collins.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.961
It's spreading quickly.

06:46.899 --> 06:50.000
There's a group of people
who meet on Wednesday nights.

06:50.002 --> 06:53.572
It might help maybe
to talk with people who

06:53.574 --> 06:55.109
are going through
the same thing.

06:57.711 --> 06:59.344
I don't want to
spend the last six weeks

06:59.346 --> 07:03.750
of my life talking about
the last six weeks of my life.

07:05.752 --> 07:07.221
I can understand that.

07:10.723 --> 07:13.091
In the meantime,
I'm going to prescribe something

07:13.093 --> 07:15.226
that will ease
the pain a little bit.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.161
Make sure
you take these twice daily.

07:17.163 --> 07:18.533
Okay?

07:34.146 --> 07:36.081
Jackie, you in there?

07:36.083 --> 07:38.683
- What are you doing?
- Taking a shit.

07:38.685 --> 07:42.187
- That's not very lady-like, is it?
- Neither is my cock.

07:42.189 --> 07:45.190
Listen, we've got, uh... We've
got a new kid start tonight.

07:45.192 --> 07:48.726
His name's Faith, just
want you to show him around.

07:48.728 --> 07:50.295
You know, make him feel at home.

07:50.297 --> 07:53.264
Look, I am not
a fucking babysitter.

07:53.266 --> 07:56.267
I'm not asking you to hold his fucking
hand whilst he crosses the street, okay?

07:56.269 --> 07:58.139
Just give him a
little tour round, okay?

07:59.673 --> 08:00.904
Where is he?

08:00.906 --> 08:02.774
He's in the dressing room.

08:02.776 --> 08:03.908
Thank you very much.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.043
Ta-ta, ta-ta.

08:05.045 --> 08:06.112
Fucking unbelievable.

08:12.819 --> 08:16.120
Oh, fuckin' hell.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.158
Jesus.

08:22.428 --> 08:25.730
Anyway
Threw up all over his cock.

08:25.732 --> 08:27.365
Well, it's safe to say
you're never gonna

08:27.367 --> 08:30.901
- make a sword swallower, dear.
- What does he...

08:30.903 --> 08:32.437
Hey, um, exc... You're Faith?

08:32.438 --> 08:36.808
- Faith? Faith?
- Yes, I am. And you are?

08:36.809 --> 08:40.077
I am your fairy godmother,
you can call me Jackie.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.046
You're Jackie?

08:41.048 --> 08:42.046
I am.

08:42.048 --> 08:43.815
The one and only Jackie.

08:43.817 --> 08:45.817
I didn't
expect you to be so...

08:45.819 --> 08:47.218
Old, old? I know, old.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.986
Well, you gotta
pay the bills, kid.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.355
Do you mind?
You're sitting in my chair.

08:50.357 --> 08:51.726
Oh, sorry.

08:56.129 --> 08:58.962
How do you
walk in those high heels?

08:58.964 --> 09:01.466
- I've been practicing since I was nine.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.468 --> 09:04.802
So, tell me, ahem, what is it you do?
You know, what's your thing?

09:04.804 --> 09:07.772
You're a comedian, you dance,
you sing? What is it?

09:07.774 --> 09:09.273
- What's your thing?
- I'm a singer.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.008
Oh, you're a s...

09:11.010 --> 09:14.278
Mollie, you think you got
a bit of competition here.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.948
Oh, bitch, please, the BFG ain't
got nothing on this, honey.

09:16.950 --> 09:20.852
Don't worry about her.
She's all bark and no bite.

09:20.854 --> 09:24.222
Now, listen, couple of rules
you've, uh, gotta know.

09:24.224 --> 09:26.291
First of all, there's
no fucking the customers.

09:26.293 --> 09:29.359
Now, I know that sounds
very obvious, but...

09:29.361 --> 09:32.262
I mean, you've got no idea how...
No, no, it happens.

09:32.264 --> 09:33.864
So, whatever
you've got in your panties,

09:33.866 --> 09:35.499
you just keep it in there.
Alright?

09:35.501 --> 09:39.137
- Mm-hmm.
- Secondly, all your tips are your own.

09:39.139 --> 09:41.873
We don't share shit here.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.108
Now, you know, generally,
the audience are pretty,

09:44.110 --> 09:46.044
you know, generous as long
as you give them what they want.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.811
Well, within reason, remember.

09:47.813 --> 09:50.315
- What's the first rule?
- No fucking the customers.

09:50.317 --> 09:54.319
Good. Good. Now, third rule is,

09:54.321 --> 09:57.756
if anybody touches you,
you know, inappropriately,

09:57.758 --> 09:59.390
you've got all
the permission in the world

09:59.392 --> 10:00.892
to beat
the living shit out of them.

10:00.894 --> 10:03.026
Fine?
Everything makes sense with you?

10:03.028 --> 10:05.028
- Mm-hmm.
- Good. Oh, yeah.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.134
Arrive 15 minutes early,
Alex will love you.

10:09.235 --> 10:11.236
Uh, talk of the devil.

10:11.238 --> 10:12.903
Kid, you're up.

10:12.905 --> 10:13.940
Let's go.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.007
Oh, hey.

10:17.009 --> 10:19.013
Why are you Faith?

10:20.279 --> 10:21.879
'Cause everyone
needs a bit of faith

10:21.881 --> 10:23.180
in their lives, darling.

10:28.254 --> 10:30.220
I give her a week.

Hey.

12:05.118 --> 12:06.153
Hey.

12:11.924 --> 12:14.194
But what's your story?

12:15.361 --> 12:16.396
What do you mean?

12:18.899 --> 12:21.601
How did you
learn to sing like that?

12:23.636 --> 12:25.670
Self-taught, darling.

12:25.672 --> 12:29.009
I've been singing my whole life
ever since I was a little girl.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.051
So, how did you end up here?

12:38.350 --> 12:39.184
Mmh.

12:40.953 --> 12:42.619
Well, when I told
my father I wanted to be

12:42.621 --> 12:44.557
a singer,
he told me to get a real job.

12:46.359 --> 12:50.097
And when I told him I wanted to
give blowjobs, he fucking lost it.

12:51.298 --> 12:52.399
Kicked me out.

12:54.033 --> 12:55.333
The worst thing is he was right.

12:55.335 --> 12:56.903
There's no fucking money in it.

12:59.505 --> 13:01.074
This is the best gig in town.

13:03.543 --> 13:04.644
How old are you?

13:06.513 --> 13:07.947
Don't ask a lady her age.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.217
I'm 21.

13:13.219 --> 13:15.222
How old are you?

13:18.457 --> 13:21.191
- 74.
- Fuck it out.

13:21.193 --> 13:23.294
Shouldn't you be in an old
people's home or something?

13:23.296 --> 13:25.530
Listen, I don't piss
in my pants yet, you know.

13:25.532 --> 13:27.665
And when I eat,
I drool just a little.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.370
I mean, I can drive a car.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.403
- There's a lot of fight left in me still.
- Mmh.

13:33.405 --> 13:36.440
Well, you look good for
your age if that means anything.

13:36.442 --> 13:40.079
Mmh. Yeah, it does.
Thank you. Yeah.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.313
Hey. Hey.

13:42.315 --> 13:43.982
Who do we have there?

13:43.984 --> 13:45.349
A couple of fucking puffs?

13:45.351 --> 13:49.020
- Yeah. Come on. Let's go.
- Fucking faggots.

13:49.022 --> 13:50.555
It's not right.

13:50.557 --> 13:53.056
Alright. Fuck off.

13:53.058 --> 13:56.560
How are we gonna do it then?
One at a time or all at once?

13:56.562 --> 14:01.565
I mean I got quite a tight ass, but
probably about three inches between you.

14:01.567 --> 14:04.701
- Fuck you say?
- Well, that's why you're in this back alley, isn't it?

14:04.703 --> 14:06.036
To get in my back alley.

14:06.038 --> 14:08.308
Oh, fuck.

14:12.011 --> 14:15.079
Oh. Jeez.

14:15.081 --> 14:16.748
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

14:16.750 --> 14:17.717
Are you alright?

14:18.985 --> 14:21.651
I thought you said you still
had a bit of fight left in you.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.624
Oh.

14:27.027 --> 14:30.331
- - Ouw!
- Fucking moron, dickhead.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.666
Look what you've done!

14:35.668 --> 14:36.700
Fucking cowards.

14:36.702 --> 14:37.737
Fuck.

14:47.714 --> 14:50.180
You know, you didn't
have to put those back on.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.250
I can't give up, you
know.

14:54.421 --> 14:57.091
In hindsight, maybe we should've
gone back into the club.

14:57.823 --> 14:59.058
You think so?

15:00.059 --> 15:01.094
Yeah.

15:02.129 --> 15:04.298
I just hate hitting people
like that, you know.

15:06.099 --> 15:08.302
I haven't hit anybody
like that for 40 years.

15:09.369 --> 15:10.604
How did it make you feel?

15:12.172 --> 15:13.173
Good.

15:14.106 --> 15:15.442
Makes you feel alive, right?

15:17.376 --> 15:18.411
Briefly.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.713
Do you want a coffee
or something?

15:22.715 --> 15:25.451
Mmh? No. No. No.
I'm fine, really.

15:34.293 --> 15:36.160
- Mmh?
- Could I borrow some money, please?

15:36.162 --> 15:38.329
I left my purse at the club.

15:38.331 --> 15:39.664
Yeah, yeah, of course.

15:41.768 --> 15:45.670
<i>Please go to room number five.</i>

15:45.672 --> 15:48.339
Look, there you go. It's alright

15:48.341 --> 15:50.576
<i>Please go to room number five.</i>

15:52.278 --> 15:53.377
Mr. Collins.

15:53.379 --> 15:54.845
He's here.

15:54.847 --> 15:57.180
The doctor will see you now.

15:57.182 --> 15:58.181
Thank you.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.228
And so, do you, uh,

16:10.230 --> 16:11.595
do you want a lift anywhere?

16:11.597 --> 16:13.166
No, it's fine,
I have my car.

16:15.434 --> 16:19.439
Well, that was
one hell of a night.

16:20.706 --> 16:22.607
It was fun.

16:22.609 --> 16:24.445
I can
think of other words.

16:26.913 --> 16:29.313
Are you working tomorrow night?

16:29.315 --> 16:31.315
Well, as long
as I'm not fired, yes.

16:31.317 --> 16:32.782
Oh, don't worry about that.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.254
I'll clear it with Alex,
you'll be fine.

16:37.256 --> 16:40.525
Well, I suppose I'll
see you tomorrow then, Jackie.

16:40.527 --> 16:42.292
Yes, tomorrow.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.195
Thank you.

16:58.177 --> 16:59.779
Oh, fuck.

17:12.759 --> 17:14.458
Fuck me, what?

17:14.460 --> 17:15.596
Open, open it.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.266
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sleeping in my car.

17:22.268 --> 17:25.603
- You are sleeping in your car.
- Yes.

17:25.605 --> 17:29.540
Oh, God. Look, get your things together.
Come on. Get out of there. Come with me.

17:29.542 --> 17:33.611
Come with me. Just get out of
the car and come with me.

17:33.613 --> 17:35.645
- Would you j... just get out of the car?
- Really?

17:35.647 --> 17:39.883
Really. You can't sleep in your
bloody car for God's... Come on.

17:39.885 --> 17:42.853
- You know, Jack...
- Just get your things, close the boot.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.854
Get with me. Come on.

18:17.490 --> 18:21.258
Thank you so much for this, Jackie. I promise
it's only one night. Just one night.

18:21.260 --> 18:25.298
No, listen. No, you can stay here
until you get somewhere permanent.

18:26.031 --> 18:29.600
- Really?
- Yeah, fine. No, listen, you'll be very comfortable here.

18:29.602 --> 18:33.004
Oh. What? Ooh.

18:33.006 --> 18:35.573
Great, fine.
That's... No, thank you.

18:35.575 --> 18:38.575
That's lovely. Look, you...
You know, sleep well.

18:38.577 --> 18:39.643
See you in the morning. Okay?

18:39.645 --> 18:41.511
- Okay.
- I see.

18:41.513 --> 18:42.548
Thank you.

19:04.304 --> 19:05.902
Fuck!

19:05.904 --> 19:07.240
Mm-hmm.

19:15.981 --> 19:18.815
Oh, what the fuck.

19:27.693 --> 19:28.795
Oh, shit.

19:32.632 --> 19:34.731
What the fuck are you doing?

19:34.733 --> 19:37.034
- You scared me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:37.036 --> 19:41.538
Look, please, please, would you
turn the music down a little?

19:41.540 --> 19:43.507
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

19:43.509 --> 19:44.941
Now, can you please sit down?

19:44.943 --> 19:46.544
I've made you breakfast.

19:46.546 --> 19:47.844
You made me breakfast.

19:47.846 --> 19:48.914
Yes, take a seat.

19:49.848 --> 19:52.051
Oh, thank you very much.

19:53.486 --> 19:56.086
Who's the girl
in all the pictures?

19:56.088 --> 19:59.525
It's, um, it's my daughter.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.526
- Daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.528 --> 20:03.561
What's her name?

20:03.563 --> 20:04.795
Her name's Lily.

20:04.797 --> 20:06.432
So you're not one of us, then?

20:07.599 --> 20:11.000
What do you mean one of us? Hmm?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.405
The gays, darling.

20:13.573 --> 20:17.374
- No, I'm not a gay.
- Fuck off.

20:17.376 --> 20:19.512
No, it's true.
But I tell you one thing, right?

20:20.680 --> 20:25.485
I-I do like dressing as a woman,
but I also like being with women.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.757
Do you dress like a woman
outside of the club?

20:32.090 --> 20:33.757
Hm.

20:33.759 --> 20:35.328
Sort of as often as I can.

20:36.828 --> 20:39.365
Well, there's plenty of
time to turn you, darling.

20:40.866 --> 20:45.438
- What about you?
- I don't think that what's between my legs defines me.

20:46.172 --> 20:49.507
I'd prefer not
to be stuck in a box.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.673
Hm.

20:50.675 --> 20:52.610
- Stereotyped.
- Mm-hmm.

20:52.612 --> 20:55.112
- I'm not a guy. I'm not a girl.
- Hm.

20:55.114 --> 20:56.046
I'm an individual.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.414
I'm Faith.

20:57.416 --> 20:58.451
Yeah, fine.

21:00.819 --> 21:02.121
Where in the world is Lily?

21:03.588 --> 21:09.528
I, um, I don't know.

21:11.497 --> 21:16.068
We, um... haven't
spoken for 10 years.

21:20.506 --> 21:21.541
Why?

21:22.808 --> 21:24.043
We had an argument.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.113
Because?

21:27.613 --> 21:28.882
Because I wouldn't go

21:30.082 --> 21:31.518
to her mother's funeral.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.585
Why?

21:35.587 --> 21:40.493
Well...

21:42.228 --> 21:45.132
When my wife was dying,

21:46.665 --> 21:48.132
she told me not to be there.

21:48.134 --> 21:50.668
- She said that?
- Yeah, she did.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.606
Because you enjoyed...
you liked to dress as a woman?

21:56.576 --> 21:57.844
Daughter never forgave me.

22:00.913 --> 22:01.948
Jackie?

22:05.183 --> 22:06.950
What the fuck are you doing?

22:06.952 --> 22:08.251
What do you think I'm doing?

22:08.253 --> 22:11.087
I'm praying to the East.

22:11.089 --> 22:14.624
Do you know how many different people's
piss is on that floor? Disgusting.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.759
I do now. Thank you.

22:16.761 --> 22:18.761
- Can I see you in my office two secs?
- Why? What's wrong?

22:18.763 --> 22:20.130
Just two secs, two secs.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.533
Alright.

22:22.535 --> 22:24.901
- Fuck!
- Do you want a drink?

22:24.903 --> 22:26.937
Why the fuck not?

22:26.939 --> 22:27.974
Alright.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.275
Here.

22:31.277 --> 22:32.511
Thanks.

22:34.079 --> 22:37.815
So, um,
so the kid's moved in with you?

22:37.817 --> 22:40.284
Yes. Just for a little
while until he gets settled in.

22:40.286 --> 22:42.719
You think that's
a good idea, do you?

22:42.721 --> 22:43.653
What do you mean?

22:43.655 --> 22:44.988
What do I mean?

22:44.990 --> 22:46.155
I mean the kid's only

22:46.157 --> 22:48.057
21 years old, for fuck's sake.

22:48.059 --> 22:49.692
I'm a little confused.

22:49.694 --> 22:52.228
What are you-
what are you accusing me of?

22:52.230 --> 22:55.533
I just don't think it's
a very good idea. That's all.

22:55.535 --> 22:58.134
What? Because you think that I want to
fuck him? Is that what you're saying?

22:58.136 --> 23:01.805
- Hey. That's not what I said.
- Oh, no, because you don't have the balls

23:01.807 --> 23:04.542
- to say it to my face.
- Listen, we're just-

23:04.544 --> 23:07.113
- talking here, alright?
- I am not gay.

23:11.817 --> 23:13.752
- You're not?
- No, I am not.

23:15.820 --> 23:21.057
- Well... Well, I just assumed.
- Oh, yes, you assumed.

23:21.059 --> 23:23.160
Just because
I like wearing dresses,

23:23.162 --> 23:25.062
I must like sucking cock.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.896
Is that it?

23:26.898 --> 23:29.168
Well, yeah.

23:30.303 --> 23:31.538
Kind of.

23:32.571 --> 23:36.140
Look, the kid has
got nowhere to live.

23:36.142 --> 23:38.976
Do you know how
fucking scary that must be?

23:38.978 --> 23:41.946
I know. Wait, hey. Would you?
Hey, he can stay with you.

23:41.948 --> 23:44.315
- Would you like that?
- Listen, no. It's fine.

23:44.317 --> 23:47.617
I think... I think you're
doing a-a good job.

23:47.619 --> 23:50.189
Thanks for the fucking drink.

23:58.864 --> 24:02.632
We live in an age where there's
brand new gender issues, isn't there?

24:02.634 --> 24:04.301
And there's a lot
of genders going on

24:04.303 --> 24:06.069
and some people
get a little bit confused.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.605
For instance,
I know a guy, alright,

24:08.607 --> 24:11.107
who used to be a guy
and she's now a girl.

24:11.109 --> 24:15.746
And now that she's a girl, she's a
lesbian, and some people might say,

24:15.748 --> 24:17.914
"I don't get that."
You know what?

24:17.916 --> 24:21.384
I don't get that, but maybe it's
not for me to get, right?

24:21.386 --> 24:23.386
Maybe it's just not
for me to understand.

24:23.388 --> 24:26.856
But at the same, I reckon
give me a couple of years,

24:26.858 --> 24:29.626
and slowly but surely,
all the names

24:29.628 --> 24:32.363
for gender will
permeate my consciousness.

24:32.365 --> 24:34.632
But in the meantime,
can everyone else

24:34.634 --> 24:36.333
just calm the fuck down

24:36.335 --> 24:38.168
if I accidentally say trannie?

24:40.306 --> 24:41.971
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen,

24:41.973 --> 24:44.240
now for the main event
of the evening.

24:44.242 --> 24:46.809
Please stand your feet,
clap your hands,

24:46.811 --> 24:49.412
and welcome
all the way to the microphone.

24:49.414 --> 24:55.052
It's Jackie!

24:58.958 --> 25:02.062
Do you know what
a man's balanced diet is?

25:03.128 --> 25:04.862
A beer bottle in each hand.

25:05.998 --> 25:08.032
A man went into a candy shop,

25:08.034 --> 25:09.866
had to buy some condoms,

25:09.868 --> 25:11.000
and the cashier said,

25:11.002 --> 25:12.769
"Um, do you want a bag?"

25:12.771 --> 25:14.705
He said, "She's not that ugly."

25:16.008 --> 25:19.776
I do
love a dirty audience.

25:19.778 --> 25:22.345
Do you know
the difference between a hooker

25:22.347 --> 25:25.215
and-and-and
a drug dealer?

25:25.217 --> 25:28.384
Well,
a hooker can wash her crack

25:28.386 --> 25:29.385
and resell it.

25:31.723 --> 25:34.190
Oh, dear, oh dear. I'm so sorry.

25:34.192 --> 25:37.361
My boyfriend was so rough
with me last night.

25:38.864 --> 25:41.297
Do you know what the saggy boob

25:41.299 --> 25:44.735
said to the other saggy boob?

25:44.737 --> 25:46.103
If we don't get some support,

25:46.105 --> 25:47.738
people would think we're nuts.

25:54.180 --> 25:58.148
So, let me get this straight.
You haven't taken any of your pills?

25:58.150 --> 26:00.484
- No, I haven't taken any of my pills.
- Because you dropped them?

26:00.486 --> 26:03.187
- Yes, because I dropped them.
- In urine?

26:03.189 --> 26:05.091
Yes, I dropped
them in the urine.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.926
You know,
this isn't a joke, Mr. Collins.

26:08.928 --> 26:11.094
Those pills are
meant to ease your pain.

26:11.096 --> 26:13.229
You need to take them every day.

26:13.231 --> 26:15.833
You know,
last night can't happen again.

26:15.835 --> 26:19.469
Yeah, fine. Look, doc, just, you know,
write me another prescription for the pills

26:19.471 --> 26:21.074
and I'll-I'll be on my way.

26:23.108 --> 26:28.010
- So, you collapsed on stage?
- Yes, I collapsed on stage.

26:28.012 --> 26:30.780
- Was it hot on the stage?
- What... Of course, it was hot on stage.

26:30.782 --> 26:34.183
I mean, they've got lights and the
air conditioning hasn't worked since,

26:34.185 --> 26:36.286
I don't know, mid-90s.

26:36.288 --> 26:39.757
Look. I think you might
want to think about

26:39.759 --> 26:40.993
taking a back step.

26:42.193 --> 26:45.929
You mean giving up performing?

26:45.931 --> 26:47.230
It's not helping you.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.934
The stress, the conditions.

26:49.969 --> 26:53.402
At your age, you should be
living a more relaxed life.

26:53.404 --> 26:58.208
A more relaxed life? I'm dying,
for fuck's sake. How relaxed can you be?

26:58.210 --> 27:00.878
- I mean that's what's happening to me, isn't, it doctor?
- Yes.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.847
And there's absolutely nothing you can do
about it. I mean, with all of your expertise

27:04.849 --> 27:07.985
and all the millions of pounds
they put in cancer research.

27:07.987 --> 27:11.087
I mean, none of that's
gonna stop me from dying, right?

27:11.089 --> 27:15.793
- Yes, that's correct.
- So, if I'm dying and there's nothing anyone can do about it,

27:15.795 --> 27:19.062
I mean, you know, why should I
give up doing what I love?

27:19.064 --> 27:21.131
I mean, what is that
gonna do for me, doctor?

27:21.133 --> 27:23.333
Would it give me,
uh, one extra week,

27:23.335 --> 27:26.569
two extra weeks?
I mean, fucking wonderful.

27:26.571 --> 27:28.971
Dying is shit.
Did you know that?

27:28.973 --> 27:32.074
It is...
It fucking sucks, doctor.

27:32.076 --> 27:34.844
And look, if nothing
anybody can do about it

27:34.846 --> 27:36.313
and I'm going to die, right,

27:36.315 --> 27:38.047
well, I'm going to make certain

27:38.049 --> 27:41.450
that I'm going to
enjoy the last few weeks

27:41.452 --> 27:45.521
before leaving
this shitty, fucking planet.

27:45.523 --> 27:47.760
Is that alright
with you, doctor?

27:49.228 --> 27:50.960
Yes. That's okay.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.331
Good.

27:53.566 --> 27:54.768
Is he okay?

27:55.901 --> 27:57.334
Oh, yes. He'll be fine.

27:57.336 --> 27:58.401
He'll be fine.

28:01.906 --> 28:06.043
- Here, why don't you have a drink of whisky.
- No, thanks.

28:06.045 --> 28:09.179
Oh, come on.
It'll make a man of you.

28:09.181 --> 28:12.082
Okay, darling, I don't need
to be made a man of, but I'll try.

28:12.084 --> 28:13.182
Okay.

28:13.184 --> 28:14.220
Here you go.

28:15.253 --> 28:16.288
Drink up.

28:17.589 --> 28:18.521
Mm.

28:20.625 --> 28:22.127
I took you for a swallower.

28:23.496 --> 28:26.395
- How can you make jokes at a time like this?
- What do you mean?

28:26.397 --> 28:28.532
Well, look, you don't
even look like you give a shit.

28:28.534 --> 28:30.433
I know what
my face is looking like,

28:30.435 --> 28:33.135
but of course I give a shit,
of course I give a shit.

28:33.137 --> 28:34.872
I mean, who...
I don't want to die.

28:34.874 --> 28:39.042
Who the fuck wants
to die, eh? Hm?

28:39.044 --> 28:42.112
Well, look, they cure cancer all the
time, maybe they can still do something.

28:42.114 --> 28:43.479
Well, if they catch it
early enough.

28:43.481 --> 28:44.517
Have they?

28:46.018 --> 28:47.187
No, they never did.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.355
What do we do now?

28:52.057 --> 28:53.590
Get pissed.

28:53.592 --> 28:55.926
Hm.

28:55.928 --> 28:58.264
- Got a bit on the chin there.
- Yeah, I know.

28:59.330 --> 29:02.332
- What about your daughter?
- What about her?

29:02.334 --> 29:06.169
Well, you're gonna have to
tell her that you're dying.

29:06.171 --> 29:09.171
Tell my daughter, who hates me,

29:09.173 --> 29:10.207
that I'm gonna die?

29:10.209 --> 29:11.307
Yes, absolutely.

29:13.945 --> 29:15.881
I wouldn't even
know where to find her.

29:16.615 --> 29:18.448
Facebook.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.854
What the fuck is Facebook?

29:37.269 --> 29:41.071
- Is this the first laptop ever invented?
- I bought it in a boot sale.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.006
- You bought a laptop at a car boot sale?
- I bought it in a boot sale.

29:43.008 --> 29:47.443
- Does it even have the Internet?
- What's the Internet? Come on.

29:47.445 --> 29:49.680
'Course I know what
the fucking Internet is.

29:49.682 --> 29:52.582
I mean, where's your sense of humor?
I'm the one who's dying.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.684
I'm not a
fucking caveman, you know.

29:54.686 --> 29:57.586
- Coming from the man who didn't know what Facebook is.
- Mm-hmm.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.655
Now, let me set
this profile up for you.

29:59.657 --> 30:01.458
- Do you want to set one up?
- Well, wh... why?

30:01.460 --> 30:03.196
I'm gonna be dead in a month.

30:05.663 --> 30:08.030
- Do you have to be so fucking blunt about it?
- I'm sorry. I really...

30:08.032 --> 30:09.399
You're not
gonna cry again, are you?

30:09.401 --> 30:11.234
Well, no. I'm just
a very emotional person.

30:11.236 --> 30:12.501
Okay, fine. Now, tell me,

30:12.503 --> 30:15.271
How... how do I find my daughter?

30:15.273 --> 30:16.440
What's her name?

30:16.442 --> 30:17.543
Lily Collins.

30:19.678 --> 30:22.045
Wait, so that means
that you're Jackie Collins?

30:22.047 --> 30:24.581
No, I'm Jack Collins.
Jack, well, you know...

30:24.583 --> 30:26.048
How am I only just
finding that out now?

30:26.050 --> 30:27.183
You've never asked me before.

30:27.185 --> 30:28.986
- Jack Collins.
- Jack.

30:28.988 --> 30:31.555
- Jack Collins.
- Jack. J-A-C-K.

30:31.557 --> 30:33.123
- Okay.
- Right.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.057
- Is this her?
- No, that's not her.

30:35.059 --> 30:36.258
There's quite a few left.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.594
No, no, I'm fine. Next.

30:37.596 --> 30:39.129
No, no, that's not her.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.934
No, whoa...

30:42.468 --> 30:43.503
Is it...

30:44.769 --> 30:46.105
That's my little girl.

30:50.174 --> 30:52.008
Should we send her
a message, then?

30:52.010 --> 30:53.442
An email perhaps,
you have email, right?

30:53.444 --> 30:55.545
I've got email,
yeah, I've got email.

30:55.547 --> 30:58.715
But tell me, a message.
But what... what...

30:58.717 --> 31:02.585
- I mean, what am I gonna say?
- Well, just invite her for a coffee or something.

31:02.587 --> 31:06.023
The last time I invited her for a cup of coffee,
she said she never wanted to see me again.

31:06.025 --> 31:08.725
- Yeah, because she was angry. You just apologize.
- Apologize?

31:08.727 --> 31:11.394
What do you mean apologize? It's
not gonna be easy just saying,

31:11.396 --> 31:14.264
"Oh, girl, I'm sorry." You know,
it's not gonna be that easy.

31:14.266 --> 31:16.432
Yeah, well, get on your hands
and knees and beg, Jackie.

31:16.434 --> 31:18.267
- This is your daughter we're talking about.
- Alright.

31:18.269 --> 31:19.736
- Alright?
- Yes. Okay.

31:19.738 --> 31:21.270
I've got to go to
the little girls room.

31:21.272 --> 31:22.572
- Okay, it's fine.
- I expect you to have

31:22.574 --> 31:25.508
- a full message written.
- I'm gonna do it.

31:25.510 --> 31:26.445
I'm going to do it.

31:28.047 --> 31:31.384
- Do it.
- I'm doing it. Can't you see I'm doing it?

31:32.417 --> 31:33.452
Fuck.

31:36.521 --> 31:40.559
Dearest Lily...

31:47.432 --> 31:49.234
I've got so much to say.

31:51.303 --> 31:53.406
I really don't
know how to begin.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.744
I... I know you hate me.

32:00.746 --> 32:05.118
I know you hate me.

32:10.489 --> 32:12.122
I really don't blame you.

32:12.124 --> 32:13.789
I'm...

32:13.791 --> 32:20.365
Oh, I made
the most terrible mistake.

32:21.432 --> 32:25.070
<i>And I would really, um...</i>

32:26.270 --> 32:29.773
<i>I mean I'd love to, you know,
have a... a cup of coffee</i>

32:29.775 --> 32:33.179
<i>because um, I really miss you.</i>

32:34.278 --> 32:37.817
<i>Miss you, you.</i>

32:39.617 --> 32:45.354
<i>And I... I'm so sorry.</i>

32:45.356 --> 32:48.594
<i>I... made so many mistakes.</i>

32:49.894 --> 32:51.297
<i>I apologize.</i>

32:57.502 --> 33:03.375
<i>I miss you and I love you.</i>

33:05.611 --> 33:07.643
<i>I'm so sorry
I wasn't there for you.</i>

33:07.645 --> 33:12.417
I'm so sorry I
wasn't there for you.

33:15.354 --> 33:17.657
I love you.

33:21.492 --> 33:22.528
Dad.

34:33.297 --> 34:36.434
Fucking elegant, Jesus.

36:11.663 --> 36:13.697
Thank you, darling.

36:13.699 --> 36:15.465
Thank you.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.836
Thank you very much.

36:17.869 --> 36:19.305
You look fabulous.

36:21.739 --> 36:25.541
So this is, um, this was
what was on your bucket list?

36:25.543 --> 36:31.113
Yeah, well, um,
I haven't seen a pair of

36:31.115 --> 36:35.485
breasts, you know,
for about 20 years, you know.

36:35.487 --> 36:36.822
Mm-hmm.

36:39.358 --> 36:43.092
I didn't even know these places
were open in the day, to be honest.

36:43.094 --> 36:44.763
No, neither did.

36:47.431 --> 36:49.599
You know,
they do toasted sandwiches here.

36:49.601 --> 36:51.934
- What?
- Do you fancy a toasted sandwich?

36:51.936 --> 36:54.970
Uh, yeah, I mean, why not?

36:54.972 --> 36:56.472
Great.

37:01.746 --> 37:04.046
Fucking hell.

37:04.048 --> 37:05.650
I know.

37:08.652 --> 37:10.519
You wanna dance with her?

37:10.521 --> 37:14.624
No, come on,
I'm too old to dance with her.

37:14.626 --> 37:17.126
No, you idiot,
she dances for you.

37:17.128 --> 37:18.827
What?

37:18.829 --> 37:20.662
You do nothing.
Come on, let me treat you.

37:20.664 --> 37:23.932
No, no, really,
no, really. No. No.

37:23.934 --> 37:26.403
I mean,
I wouldn't know what to do.

37:26.405 --> 37:27.637
You literally do nothing.

37:27.639 --> 37:29.139
Stop being a testicle?

37:29.141 --> 37:30.639
I'm not...

37:30.641 --> 37:31.976
Now, which one do you fancy?

37:37.081 --> 37:38.782
How long have you
been doing this?

37:38.784 --> 37:39.885
Nearly a year.

37:40.952 --> 37:43.519
Do you... do you like it?

37:43.521 --> 37:45.588
- It's alright.
- Uh-huh.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.423
To meet some interesting people.

37:47.425 --> 37:49.892
Um, listen, you
really don't have to do this.

37:49.894 --> 37:52.028
I mean, I can tell my friend that
you did if you don't want to.

37:52.030 --> 37:53.496
You don't want me
to dance for you?

37:53.498 --> 37:56.432
Well, well, yes, I do, but,

37:56.434 --> 37:59.572
you see, I'm, I'm very old now.
And, um, and listen, kid,

38:01.206 --> 38:03.539
- I could be your grandfather.
- You're serious, aren't you?

38:03.541 --> 38:05.777
Yeah, I don't want
weird about it.

38:06.945 --> 38:08.748
Just sit back, okay?

38:12.050 --> 38:15.621
I don't want you to feel
like you have to do this. You...

38:21.960 --> 38:23.693
What's a handsome man
like you doing in

38:23.695 --> 38:25.728
a strip club
at three in the afternoon?

38:25.730 --> 38:28.597
Well, I really didn't
have anywhere else to go.

38:28.599 --> 38:32.501
Oh, well, you know how
to make a girl feel special.

38:32.503 --> 38:35.505
- Oh, no. Sorry. No, I didn't mean that.
- I'm fucking with you.

38:35.507 --> 38:40.543
It's just, um, it... it's
that I haven't, you know, seen,

38:40.545 --> 38:45.215
I mean, really,
seen a woman for 20 years.

38:45.217 --> 38:49.519
And, you know, when you get an
old man like me, you know, look at

38:49.521 --> 38:52.722
girls and people think you're like
a, you know, a dirty old man.

38:52.724 --> 38:56.258
Some sort of awful pervert
or something like that.

38:56.260 --> 39:00.563
And, you know, mind you,
I could be something back in the '60s.

39:00.565 --> 39:03.532
Do you know, I-I was really...
A lot of people thought

39:03.534 --> 39:05.901
I was, you know,
and sort of that desirable.

39:05.903 --> 39:08.670
I bet you used to get
all the girls back in the day.

39:08.672 --> 39:12.677
Well, there was really only one.

39:13.711 --> 39:15.811
We were high school sweethearts.

39:15.813 --> 39:18.113
Aw, cute.
How long were you together?

39:18.115 --> 39:20.083
- 54 years.
- Fuck off.

39:20.085 --> 39:22.117
Yes. Yeah.

39:22.119 --> 39:25.021
Um, you haven't got a fella?

39:25.023 --> 39:27.824
I'm not really into boys,
if you know what I mean.

39:27.826 --> 39:30.193
- What do you mean boys?
- I prefer women.

39:30.195 --> 39:32.929
Oh, you do? Oh, that's fine.
Oh, good on you. That's fine.

39:32.931 --> 39:34.633
I don't mind...
That's good. Good.

39:35.934 --> 39:41.240
So... what do you think?

39:42.673 --> 39:44.007
Amazing.

39:44.009 --> 39:47.776
Thank you. Give me your hand.

39:47.778 --> 39:49.612
No, don't, really,
really, don't, no, no.

39:49.614 --> 39:51.717
- Give me your hand, it's grand.
- They're cold.

39:55.019 --> 39:56.318
You have very soft hands.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.186
Thank you.

39:58.188 --> 39:59.491
I moisturize.

40:00.925 --> 40:02.624
I don't even know your name.

40:02.626 --> 40:03.661
Jack.

40:04.762 --> 40:09.298
Well, Jack, it's been
a pleasure to dance for you.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.101
- Thank you, it has.
- Come and see me again some time.

40:12.103 --> 40:16.738
Oh, yeah, definitely. Listen,
please, oh, wait a minute.

40:16.740 --> 40:20.142
- Oh, no, it's okay.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, really, really, look, please,

40:20.144 --> 40:23.679
I-I really,
I really want you to take it.

40:23.681 --> 40:25.213
- No, you really don't have to.
- No, no, thank you, no,

40:25.215 --> 40:27.316
you know, for the nice talk.

40:27.318 --> 40:29.117
I loved it.

40:29.119 --> 40:30.121
Thank you.

40:35.193 --> 40:37.025
- Hey, hold on, big boy.
- Mh.

40:37.027 --> 40:38.894
- Hold this for me a second.
- Yeah.

40:38.896 --> 40:39.996
Hold this.

40:39.998 --> 40:41.200
Oh, right.

40:45.603 --> 40:47.135
Thank you. I'll have that back.

40:47.137 --> 40:50.072
- Oh, yeah.
- How was it?

40:50.074 --> 40:51.210
Spectacular.

40:52.277 --> 40:54.077
I mean, she was cute.

40:54.079 --> 40:56.144
If I was straight,
I'd totally ask her to

40:56.146 --> 40:57.780
sit in the back
of the cinema with me.

40:57.782 --> 41:00.617
What about you?

41:00.619 --> 41:01.950
What about me?

41:01.952 --> 41:06.623
- You know, you got a fella?
- No.

41:06.625 --> 41:10.628
I mean, there was this one boy,
but, um, didn't work out.

41:12.831 --> 41:13.865
Why?

41:16.201 --> 41:18.934
I suppose I loved him
more than he loved me.

41:18.936 --> 41:21.269
- It's a very complex thing, love.
- Mm.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.942
Sometimes I wonder why
we only have one word for it.

41:25.010 --> 41:26.909
Do you ever speak with him?

41:26.911 --> 41:29.811
- No, nothing left to say.
- Mm-hmm.

41:29.813 --> 41:33.217
Plus, I'm not the first person
to have my heart broken.

41:35.719 --> 41:38.987
Fucking no. It's depressing enough as it is.

41:38.989 --> 41:40.822
Come on,
what else do you wanna do?

41:40.824 --> 41:45.128
Well, there is... there is
something I'd like to do.

41:45.130 --> 41:48.264
So, listen, I'll see you tonight
at the club? Alright?

41:48.266 --> 41:49.934
Sure, yeah, no problem.

42:37.981 --> 42:42.818
Well, um, where to begin?

42:42.820 --> 42:45.921
Oh, yes, I went to a...
a strip club today.

42:45.923 --> 42:48.925
I met this lovely girl.

42:48.927 --> 42:49.961
Oh, no.

42:50.929 --> 42:52.197
Nothing like that.

42:53.231 --> 42:56.199
She showed me her breasts,
they were amazing.

42:56.201 --> 43:00.271
I mean just like... Well, actually,
yours were nicer, they were.

43:02.273 --> 43:06.010
Well, um, how've you been?

43:07.512 --> 43:11.780
I'm sorry I haven't
really been around too often.

43:11.782 --> 43:15.284
Because I didn't think
you really wanted me to

43:15.286 --> 43:20.291
and I still...
Still don't think you do.

43:22.427 --> 43:26.862
Well, um,
I have a bit of bad news.

43:26.864 --> 43:33.135
You see, I'm dying.

43:33.137 --> 43:34.405
I'm dying real quick.

43:35.974 --> 43:40.275
So, I'll be
seeing you real soon.

43:40.277 --> 43:43.179
I... I don't know
how you feel about that

43:43.181 --> 43:50.088
because... I'm a little
nervous my... myself.

43:52.556 --> 43:55.258
And anyway I...
I really wanted to come

43:55.260 --> 44:00.299
and tell you and, um,
ask you a favor.

44:02.967 --> 44:09.508
See, when I come up there,
um, please don't shout at me.

44:10.974 --> 44:17.280
Because, um,
I don't think I could

44:17.282 --> 44:22.385
stand for that all eternity

44:22.387 --> 44:26.158
because I know you...
You hate me.

44:27.391 --> 44:31.797
But I never... I never
really wanted you to know.

44:35.132 --> 44:37.168
I'm so sorry
I wasn't at the funeral.

44:39.971 --> 44:45.443
I really wanted to be, but how
could I be when you didn't want me.

44:46.610 --> 44:53.851
I... loved you too much to,
you know, hurt you again.

44:56.621 --> 45:02.827
I've never...
I've never stopped loving you.

45:06.431 --> 45:08.300
I really should be going.

45:16.974 --> 45:19.577
I am so terribly sorry.

45:22.280 --> 45:29.254
Well, see you real soon.

45:33.090 --> 45:34.492
Yeah.

45:40.498 --> 45:43.298
- I'll fucking kill you.
- I'd like to see you try, baby.

45:43.300 --> 45:46.334
- Fuck this...
- Ever since I came

45:46.336 --> 45:48.237
to this club, you've been
trying to take my shit.

45:48.239 --> 45:51.574
- Get the fuck off me.
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

45:51.576 --> 45:53.541
- You fucking piece of shit.
- What the fuck is going on here?

45:53.543 --> 45:55.211
- This bitch is trying
to steal my fucking style.

45:55.213 --> 45:56.345
It's just a coincidence.

45:56.347 --> 45:57.979
Beyoncé here decides

45:57.981 --> 46:00.148
- to lose her shit about it.
- Fuck you.

46:00.150 --> 46:03.184
- You're just jealous of my ass.
- Bitch, please.

46:03.186 --> 46:07.956
Look, would you just fuck...
Get the fuck out of here.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.624
Just go.

46:09.626 --> 46:12.327
Jesus, what are you doing?

46:12.329 --> 46:15.664
- That little shit is just wearing my makeup.
- He's just a kid.

46:15.666 --> 46:19.001
He's 21. He knows
not to be a little cunt.

46:19.003 --> 46:22.470
- Oh, you, you are just jealous.
- What are you talking about?

46:22.472 --> 46:25.041
Well, actually what I'm
talking about, you're nearly 50.

46:25.043 --> 46:27.208
No matter how much
you pull yourself in.

46:27.210 --> 46:30.079
No matter how many dresses you
wear, you're still gonna look

46:30.081 --> 46:33.048
older than him and he's still
gonna look younger than you.

46:33.050 --> 46:36.084
I'm like a fine wine, darling.
I get better with age.

46:36.086 --> 46:37.552
Yes, of course,
and some of the greatest wines

46:37.554 --> 46:39.588
- I ever drunk were old.
- Exactly.

46:39.590 --> 46:42.661
But then I thought to myself,
"They're not fucking worth it."

46:51.068 --> 46:53.568
- Are you alright?
- Who the fuck does she think she is?

46:53.570 --> 46:55.570
- I mean, what is going on?
- What do you mean?

46:55.572 --> 46:58.541
What do I mean?
You had Mollie on the floor.

46:58.543 --> 47:00.543
You were beating
the living shit out of her.

47:00.545 --> 47:01.711
What do you want to say, Jackie?

47:01.713 --> 47:03.311
I want you to tell me the truth.

47:03.313 --> 47:04.612
- Do you want the truth?
- Yes, I do.

47:04.614 --> 47:06.182
The fuck all, alright?

47:06.184 --> 47:08.249
The fuck, I'm singing
for £40 a night,

47:08.251 --> 47:09.617
I'm sleeping
on your fucking sofa.

47:09.619 --> 47:11.586
My dad hates me.

47:11.588 --> 47:14.023
I broke my favorite
pair of fucking heels today.

47:14.025 --> 47:15.758
I don't have much,
but I've got style.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.594
So when someone tries to take
it from me, it pisses me off.

47:18.596 --> 47:20.229
You've always got me, Faith.

47:20.231 --> 47:21.500
Yeah, not for much longer.

47:23.701 --> 47:25.066
Okay, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean that.

47:25.068 --> 47:27.536
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

47:27.538 --> 47:29.604
Oh, yes you did.

47:29.606 --> 47:30.641
Jackie.

47:35.079 --> 47:36.378
Fuck.

51:41.458 --> 51:42.492
Hi.

51:46.364 --> 51:47.398
Hi.

51:48.632 --> 51:49.667
What are you doing?

51:51.268 --> 51:52.937
I'm having
a cheeky fag before work.

51:54.739 --> 51:56.608
why didn't you
come home last night?

51:58.376 --> 52:00.909
Uh, I didn't
think you wanted me to.

52:00.911 --> 52:04.516
What are
you talking about?

52:05.449 --> 52:08.483
You know, after what I said.

52:08.485 --> 52:10.989
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

52:12.389 --> 52:16.525
Listen, I'm not your dad,
you know that.

52:16.527 --> 52:18.929
Look, you've always
got a home with me, really.

52:24.635 --> 52:25.870
Thank you, Jackie.

52:27.304 --> 52:31.005
You better have a shower, do you
know I can smell you right from here?

52:45.088 --> 52:47.625
So, do you have anything else
on your bucket list?

52:48.525 --> 52:51.730
Yes, yes, there is something.

53:05.509 --> 53:06.909
So, this is the place?

53:06.911 --> 53:08.380
Yeah, looks like it.

53:10.581 --> 53:12.514
Do you want us to
go in together?

53:12.516 --> 53:13.816
Well, of course
we're gonna go in together.

53:13.818 --> 53:16.751
Okay, well, do I look good?

53:16.753 --> 53:18.653
Yes, you look good. What?

53:18.655 --> 53:22.124
What the fuck, it's just a
drug dealer for, Christ's sake.

53:22.126 --> 53:24.496
- And?
- You look lovely.

53:25.795 --> 53:26.830
Come on.

53:40.010 --> 53:41.142
Come on, Faith.

53:41.144 --> 53:42.845
Give me a

54:01.398 --> 54:03.164
You're, uh, Daryl?

54:03.166 --> 54:04.932
Yeah.

54:04.934 --> 54:06.501
This is Bianca.

54:06.503 --> 54:08.436
Very pleased to
meet you, Bianca.

54:08.438 --> 54:09.606
She's sleeping.

54:12.108 --> 54:13.941
What is it you want?

54:13.943 --> 54:16.979
Um, Alex gave me your address
and he said that he would

54:16.981 --> 54:20.081
text you, or call you and say
that we were gonna pop by.

54:20.083 --> 54:21.182
I didn't get a text.

54:21.184 --> 54:22.085
You didn't get a text?

54:23.987 --> 54:26.655
- This is not gonna be very good.
- I told you.

54:26.657 --> 54:27.992
It's fucking one in the morning.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.128
You're a guy, right?

54:33.664 --> 54:36.532
It depends what
your definition of a guy is.

54:36.534 --> 54:37.602
Well, you got a cock.

54:38.635 --> 54:40.202
Yes, I do, yeah.

54:40.204 --> 54:41.539
So, you're a guy then?

54:42.639 --> 54:44.206
I mean, it's a little
more complicated than that,

54:44.208 --> 54:48.610
but it's late,
so I'd agree to disagree.

54:48.612 --> 54:50.115
Disagree that you've got a cock?

54:51.614 --> 54:53.548
Disagree that
that's what makes me a man.

54:53.550 --> 54:56.952
Well, I don't get it, guys got
cocks, women have got pussies.

54:56.954 --> 54:59.854
Simple as that, ain't it, mate?
What about you?

54:59.856 --> 55:01.690
- I think we ought to be going.
- I think so too.

55:01.692 --> 55:03.224
No, no, no. stay there.

55:03.226 --> 55:06.061
- You got money, right?
- Yes, I have, yeah.

55:06.063 --> 55:07.095
Let's do a bit of business.

55:07.097 --> 55:08.530
What is it you want?

55:08.532 --> 55:11.467
Um, what have you got?

55:11.469 --> 55:12.568
She's in a candy shop.

55:12.570 --> 55:13.905
I'm not your sugar daddy.

55:15.539 --> 55:16.505
Doesn't make any sense.

55:16.507 --> 55:17.575
The fuck did you say?

55:19.043 --> 55:19.974
Uh, nothing.

55:19.976 --> 55:21.776
You have coke?

55:21.778 --> 55:23.177
Of course I've got coke.

55:23.179 --> 55:24.179
Yes.

55:24.181 --> 55:25.483
How much do you want?

55:26.884 --> 55:29.885
Um, how much
do people usually take?

55:29.887 --> 55:30.885
Of cocaine?

55:30.887 --> 55:31.956
Yes, of cocaine.

55:32.956 --> 55:34.092
Is it just for tonight?

55:35.592 --> 55:38.126
It was just for
a one-off thing.

55:38.128 --> 55:41.796
- Okay, well, a gram should do you.
- Ok, yeah, fine. Gram.

55:41.798 --> 55:43.865
Alright.

55:43.867 --> 55:45.501
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, sure, I'm fine.

55:45.503 --> 55:47.202
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55:47.204 --> 55:48.807
That will be 90.

55:50.974 --> 55:51.907
Pounds?

55:51.909 --> 55:53.845
Yes, pounds.

55:55.112 --> 55:57.045
Lot of difference from the '60s.

55:57.047 --> 55:59.081
Got off a bit since then. Yeah.

55:59.083 --> 56:00.452
Okay, 90.

56:14.565 --> 56:15.733
I'm a little bit short.

56:16.733 --> 56:18.233
You've got a fiver?

56:18.235 --> 56:20.601
You're not serious, are you?

56:20.603 --> 56:21.603
Oy!

56:21.605 --> 56:23.804
- 20, 30...
- Oy!

56:23.806 --> 56:26.675
- Excuse me, I'm counting.
- It's not a fairground. I don't take coppers.

56:26.677 --> 56:29.577
We didn't know it was
gonna be, you know, this much.

56:29.579 --> 56:32.213
Just fuck off out of my flat.
Just get out.

56:32.215 --> 56:35.550
Look. Can I give you 85
for half a gram?

56:35.552 --> 56:36.621
Is that alright?

56:38.856 --> 56:41.088
Yes, just give us that money.
Come on. Come on.

56:41.090 --> 56:43.057
- Give us it.
- Thank you very much.

56:43.059 --> 56:44.992
There you go now, bugger off.

56:44.994 --> 56:46.795
Thank you very much. Sorry.

56:46.797 --> 56:50.164
And you, twinkle tits, piss off.

56:50.166 --> 56:51.668
That's a lovely jacket, really.

56:56.673 --> 56:59.277
Kim, fruit case, uh, see that?

57:00.811 --> 57:05.280
Confusing. Fuck it.

59:38.367 --> 59:39.804
Bloody thing.

01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:08.362
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:00:08.364 --> 01:00:13.802
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:13.804 --> 01:00:16.905
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:17.875
It's okay.

01:00:22.179 --> 01:00:24.347
It's okay.

01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:32.390
It's okay.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:36.259
- I have a question.
- Yeah.

01:00:38.362 --> 01:00:41.095
When did you first
start wearing women's clothes?

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:42.333
When did I start?

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:45.467
Well, when did I start?

01:00:45.469 --> 01:00:47.505
I'm stupid for doing it.

01:00:49.039 --> 01:00:53.111
Must be... must be
near on 50 years now.

01:00:55.045 --> 01:00:56.510
Why?

01:00:56.512 --> 01:01:02.583
Why? Why?

01:01:02.585 --> 01:01:07.057
Makes me feel
a different person.

01:01:09.393 --> 01:01:11.559
- Different?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:11.561 --> 01:01:14.028
And so you just
kept it a secret.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.434
I just preferred
not to tell anybody.

01:01:18.402 --> 01:01:22.336
- So then why did you tell your wife?
- I didn't.

01:01:22.338 --> 01:01:25.240
She came home early one day

01:01:25.242 --> 01:01:29.543
and she saw me
dancing to Tom Jones.

01:01:29.545 --> 01:01:31.313
So?

01:01:31.315 --> 01:01:33.315
Wearing her wedding dress.

01:01:33.317 --> 01:01:35.349
No, it's not funny.

01:01:35.351 --> 01:01:37.586
- Fuck.
- Yeah, fuck.

01:01:37.588 --> 01:01:40.588
I must say that you do make
a very attractive woman, Jackie.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:44.996
Oh, for Christ's sake, don't...
Fuck off, Jesus Christ.

01:01:46.963 --> 01:01:49.965
I'm gonna get out of the fucking
bath, I got enough wrinkles.

01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:51.199
Yes, you do.

01:03:04.407 --> 01:03:06.608
You have really pretty nails.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:08.309
Do I?

01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:11.679
Oh, thank you,
thank you very much.

01:03:11.681 --> 01:03:16.351
My mom said I'm not allowed
to pick nails until I'm older.

01:03:16.353 --> 01:03:22.257
But you know something? I think... I think
your mommy is a very, very wise lady.

01:03:22.259 --> 01:03:23.958
- She is.
- Yes.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.726
It's okay, though,
it's my birthday soon.

01:03:25.728 --> 01:03:27.195
Is it your birthday?

01:03:27.197 --> 01:03:29.030
Yes, and I'm turning six.

01:03:29.032 --> 01:03:31.499
Wow, six.

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:32.637
How old are you?

01:03:34.204 --> 01:03:36.070
How old do you think I am?

01:03:36.072 --> 01:03:37.574
Old, like 20.

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:41.041
- That's near enough.
- Rosie.

01:03:41.043 --> 01:03:44.713
Rosie, what have I told you
about running away like that?

01:03:44.715 --> 01:03:47.315
- No, it's really...
- Sorry, mommy.

01:03:47.317 --> 01:03:50.318
It's really alright, she's a...
She's a lovely little girl.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.521
- Thank you. Has she been bothering you?
- No, no, no, she's been lovely.

01:03:54.523 --> 01:03:56.191
- Say goodbye, Rosie.
- Bye.

01:03:56.193 --> 01:03:58.126
Bye, bye, Rosie,
very nice meeting you.

01:03:58.128 --> 01:04:00.264
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:08.737
What...
what is all this?

01:04:08.739 --> 01:04:12.474
- Surprise.
- Did you cook this?

01:04:12.476 --> 01:04:16.677
Yes, uh, well, when
I cooked this from a distance.

01:04:16.679 --> 01:04:19.613
It was in this recipe book.
Please take a seat.

01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:55.077
Oh. Thank you.

01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:56.579
You haven't tried it yet,
it could be shit.

01:04:56.581 --> 01:05:01.988
No, I'm saying
thank you... for everything.

01:05:03.755 --> 01:05:09.762
You know, if, um, if I had a son,
I'd want him to be exactly like you.

01:05:13.398 --> 01:05:16.599
You know, that's, um,
a really lovely thing to say.

01:05:16.601 --> 01:05:21.104
You're like the cross-dressing
granddad I always wanted.

01:05:21.106 --> 01:05:23.205
- Really?
- Mmh.

01:05:23.207 --> 01:05:25.508
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:29.778
- Oh, and eye contact, otherwise it's seven years of bad sex.
- Seven years?

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.747
I don't think
I have to worry about that.

01:05:31.749 --> 01:05:33.485
Fuck you, I was
talking about me.

01:05:36.787 --> 01:05:38.120
Alright, then, go on, try it.

01:05:38.122 --> 01:05:39.157
Mm.

01:05:48.332 --> 01:05:50.834
Mm. Would you try
and get a takeaway?

01:05:50.836 --> 01:05:52.734
- Mm.
- Yeah?

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:54.771
Oh, yeah. Finish up.

01:05:54.773 --> 01:05:58.508
Do you know why
God created orgasms?

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:02.680
So that women could moan
even when they're having fun.

01:06:03.682 --> 01:06:06.316
There was this old lady
and she went in to the dentist,

01:06:06.318 --> 01:06:09.218
waited her turn, she went
inside, took her knickers off,

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.620
sat in the chair,
lifted her legs up high.

01:06:11.622 --> 01:06:16.792
And the dentist said, "Excuse me,
madam, I'm not a gynecologist."

01:06:16.794 --> 01:06:19.329
And the old lady said,
"I know, I just

01:06:19.331 --> 01:06:21.363
want you to remove
my husband's teeth."

01:06:22.566 --> 01:06:25.200
Is that too much, is it? Oh.

01:06:25.202 --> 01:06:28.271
Well, there's this
young man, and he took a big

01:06:28.273 --> 01:06:30.472
bouquet of flowers
back to his girlfriend.

01:06:30.474 --> 01:06:35.311
The girlfriend said, "Uh,
I suppose I've got to open my legs now."

01:06:35.313 --> 01:06:37.713
He said,
"Why, don't we have a vase?"

01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:41.818
'Cause the airplane was
crashing, the girl got up

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:45.521
and screamed, she said,
"Oh, I'm gonna die."

01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:47.323
So she stripped
herself naked, she said,

01:06:47.325 --> 01:06:51.260
"If I'm gonna die,
I want to feel like a woman.

01:06:51.262 --> 01:06:55.365
Is there any man here who can
make me feel like a woman?"

01:06:55.367 --> 01:06:59.138
So a man stood up, ripped off his shirt,
threw it at her and said, "Here, wash that."

01:07:00.204 --> 01:07:07.410
I said to my father, I said, "Oh,
I'm so tired of running around in circles."

01:07:07.412 --> 01:07:09.682
So he nailed
my other foot to the floor.

01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:13.519
I used to be
a very good father, oh, yes.

01:07:16.387 --> 01:07:21.490
And I... I sang
to my little girl every night.

01:07:21.492 --> 01:07:24.260
I told her little stories.

01:07:24.262 --> 01:07:28.263
Christmas time,
I'd dress up as Father Christmas

01:07:28.265 --> 01:07:31.968
and then she'd leave little
mince pies by the fireplace

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.207
for when Father Christmas
came down to eat.

01:07:36.374 --> 01:07:37.676
Fuck, they were stale.

01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:40.345
And then I used to dream.

01:07:41.378 --> 01:07:44.849
I used to dream
wonderful dreams for her.

01:07:46.351 --> 01:07:48.584
And that's the way
it should have been.

01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:50.822
Oh, but dear, I did fuck up.

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:57.463
And so I haven't seen my little
girl for, ooh... 10 years.

01:07:58.563 --> 01:08:02.398
So one day, you know,
I'm going to solve my problem,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.338
but tonight
it's got to be through whisky.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.888
You were very funny tonight.

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.727
Thank you.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:38.968
Wow, uh, you look...
You look really... great.

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:40.669
Thank you.

01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:41.706
So do you.

01:08:43.508 --> 01:08:44.977
Well, I'm a bit old, you know.

01:08:46.477 --> 01:08:48.278
I think it suits you.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:49.314
Thank you.

01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:52.984
How many more times do you think
we're gonna say thank you?

01:08:54.285 --> 01:08:59.955
I, um, I thought you never
wanted to speak to me again.

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:01.225
No, I didn't.

01:09:02.593 --> 01:09:04.395
What changed your mind?

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.233
I found a little Faith.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:11.334
What did he say?

01:09:11.336 --> 01:09:14.336
Well, he... he told me everything
that you've done for him,

01:09:14.337 --> 01:09:15.807
which is pretty amazing.

01:09:17.308 --> 01:09:20.575
And, um... And he told me that you
were ill. I hope it's nothing serious.

01:09:20.577 --> 01:09:24.446
No, no, no,
just a bit of a cough.

01:09:24.448 --> 01:09:26.747
- Nothing serious at all.
- So you've been to a doctor?

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.551
Oh, yes, I've been to the...
yeah, but I don't like making a fuss.

01:09:30.554 --> 01:09:31.856
You love to make a fuss.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.727
Only around you.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.066
Got a question.

01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:45.303
Mm-hmm.

01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:49.037
- Where do you buy all your clothes?
- Where I buy my clothes?

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.543
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,
you're quite a big guy. I mean tall. Tall.

01:09:54.545 --> 01:09:57.779
- Yes, 5'10.
- You know what I mean.

01:09:57.781 --> 01:10:02.854
Yeah, but, you know, they do... they have
shops for fat women as well, you know.

01:10:06.357 --> 01:10:07.724
So what about you?

01:10:07.726 --> 01:10:09.728
I mean, what's, um, what's new?

01:10:11.429 --> 01:10:13.532
Uh, well, I'm an architect.

01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:17.800
You're an arch... Really?

01:10:17.802 --> 01:10:18.836
Wow.

01:10:19.937 --> 01:10:22.471
Yeah, I'm living up in London.

01:10:22.473 --> 01:10:24.740
I won't hold that against you.

01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:29.544
- Got a dog and...
- Oh, wait, what is this? What...

01:10:29.546 --> 01:10:30.712
Oh, yeah,
and I'm getting married.

01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:32.648
You're getting married?

01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:35.685
Oh, god! Congratulations.

01:10:35.687 --> 01:10:37.453
Thank you.

01:10:37.455 --> 01:10:40.455
Um, has he got a name?

01:10:40.457 --> 01:10:44.429
- Mark.
- Mark, beautiful name.

01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:47.633
Have you... have you set a date?

01:10:48.532 --> 01:10:49.934
Yeah, it's in a month.

01:10:50.835 --> 01:10:51.870
In a month.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:54.005
What about you, dad?

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.605
Anyone special in your life?

01:10:56.607 --> 01:10:58.841
- What do you mean? Like a lady?
- Yeah.

01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:02.912
- No, no.
- Why?

01:11:02.914 --> 01:11:04.416
Well, I mean.

01:11:06.017 --> 01:11:07.984
I am a little old now, you know.

01:11:07.986 --> 01:11:13.826
A little old to fall in love.

01:11:16.193 --> 01:11:21.963
- I am really sorry about everything.
- I know. I know you are.

01:11:21.965 --> 01:11:25.501
I always have known that you've been sorry,
but that doesn't make it any easier, does it?

01:11:25.503 --> 01:11:28.003
- I really loved your mother.
- Yes, and she loved you too.

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:30.539
I genuinely believe
she died of a broken heart.

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.010
- Look, I am so sorry, really.
- Do you know what?

01:11:34.012 --> 01:11:36.381
I hated you for
the way you made her feel.

01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:40.552
I hated you for all the shit
you put me through at school.

01:11:41.486 --> 01:11:43.953
Do you know I hated you the most
because you just gave up on us.

01:11:43.955 --> 01:11:45.587
Do you think that's what I did?

01:11:45.589 --> 01:11:46.691
Mom died.

01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:50.461
All I wanted was a hug.

01:11:52.263 --> 01:11:55.401
I didn't give a fuck that you were wearing a
dress, you're my dad and you weren't there.

01:11:56.668 --> 01:12:01.937
I mean, your mother... Your mother was
so... I don't know, she was embarrassed,

01:12:01.939 --> 01:12:03.873
she was humiliated,
she hated it.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.608
She didn't want me there.

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:06.879
I wanted you there.

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:09.615
I wanted you there.

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:15.150
There's not one day that passes
when I don't wish that

01:12:15.152 --> 01:12:19.654
I could turn back time,
that I could wear that suit, but I can't.

01:12:19.656 --> 01:12:23.758
I just, I...
I can't turn back the time.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.663
All I can try and do is...
is make up for it now with you.

01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:30.936
- I can... But it's just that I...
- It's just that what?

01:12:32.135 --> 01:12:33.539
Lily, it's just that I'm-

01:12:35.173 --> 01:12:37.876
I'm not sure how to do that
anymore, you see, I...

01:12:39.009 --> 01:12:43.181
I don't think I... I don't think
I can remember how to be a dad.

01:12:44.682 --> 01:12:49.118
But that's so easy.
You just have to love me.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.785
Of course, I love you.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:53.558
I've always loved you,
you're my little girl.

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:14.810
Okay, okay, but this is it, alright?
No second chances.

01:13:14.812 --> 01:13:18.884
You fucked up once and you cannot fuck up
again, dad, because I need you in my life.

01:13:20.585 --> 01:13:21.816
I am here now for you.

01:13:21.818 --> 01:13:23.921
I am-I promise you I'm here.

01:13:26.723 --> 01:13:31.159
Dad I-I want you
to walk me down the aisle.

01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:37.669
In a month, hmm?

01:13:38.635 --> 01:13:41.303
Yeah, I will. I will.

01:13:41.305 --> 01:13:43.638
But you have to
promise me one thing.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.274
Hmm?

01:13:45.276 --> 01:13:47.646
You cannot wear
a better dress than me.

01:13:50.682 --> 01:13:51.717
Thank you.

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:53.752
Thank you.

01:13:54.852 --> 01:13:56.988
And I've told Mark about...

01:13:58.856 --> 01:14:01.222
He's just
so excited to meet you.

01:14:01.224 --> 01:14:02.260
Thanks.

01:14:08.232 --> 01:14:10.132
Look, I better go.
It's getting late.

01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:12.668
- Do you need a lift anywhere?
- No, I drove.

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.169
- You haven't had too much to drink?
- I had one.

01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:16.605
Oh, you had one. That is okay.

01:14:16.607 --> 01:14:17.707
What are you doing Friday night?

01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:19.809
Friday night...

01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:22.243
Oh, one show,
only at ten o'clock, though.

01:14:22.245 --> 01:14:24.079
So, do you wanna
meet sometime before?

01:14:24.081 --> 01:14:26.181
Oh, I would love really love to.

01:14:26.183 --> 01:14:28.050
Great, I'll, um,
leave a message for you

01:14:28.052 --> 01:14:30.185
if I'm able to
come to your place.

01:14:30.187 --> 01:14:32.087
I won't be here right up to

01:15:03.687 --> 01:15:05.820
So, one day this beautiful woman

01:15:05.822 --> 01:15:07.692
walks into a doctor's surgery.

01:15:08.393 --> 01:15:12.828
In fact, she's so attractive that
the doctor loses all professionalism.

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:14.262
He says to her,

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:15.797
"Take down your trousers"

01:15:15.799 --> 01:15:17.702
and begins to touch her thighs.

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:20.970
He says, "Do you know
what I'm doing now?"

01:15:20.972 --> 01:15:23.241
She says, "Yes,
checking for abnormalities."

01:15:24.442 --> 01:15:27.075
Then he asks her
to take off her bra,

01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:29.979
starts massaging her breasts.

01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:32.148
He says, "Do you know
what I'm doing now?"

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:34.286
She said,
"Yes, checking for cancer."

01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:39.221
Then he got her to take her panties
off and laid her on the table

01:15:39.223 --> 01:15:44.694
and starts having sex with her and
says, "Do you know what I am doing now?"

01:15:44.696 --> 01:15:48.096
And she says, "Yes, getting
herpes, that's why I'm here."

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:53.372
A good friend of mine
told me that joke.

01:15:54.839 --> 01:15:59.177
He was a great man before
he got all selfish and died.

01:16:01.179 --> 01:16:05.780
The truth is,
he was like a father to me,

01:16:05.782 --> 01:16:09.718
but he was a father
to his daughter Lily.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.252
Just before he passed,

01:16:11.254 --> 01:16:14.323
he walked his lovely daughter
down the aisle.

01:16:14.325 --> 01:16:18.697
To me, he was granddad,
to Lily, he was dad.

01:16:19.796 --> 01:16:24.999
