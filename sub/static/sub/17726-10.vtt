00:04.905 --> 00:07.575
Lauren and Ashley Wirkus
are these towering blonde twins.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.210
- Have you ever been out
to Montauk?

00:09.243 --> 00:11.212
You definitely should make
a girls' trip and come.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.580
- Patrick and I
aren't together.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.049
And, like, I'm going to Montauk.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.419
And if a dude comes up to me,
I will entertain it.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.121
- Can you come over there later,
or what?

00:20.154 --> 00:21.522
- Maybe we can later.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.690
Like, grey pubes?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.358
No, I can't.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.593
- Oh, my God.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.827
[horn honking, laughter]
- Wow!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.662
- Welcome to the Sonoma Express!

00:28.696 --> 00:30.030
- Pass me the tequila.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.100
- Whoo!

00:32.133 --> 00:33.401
- Have you heard from Lala?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.435
She didn't go to Sonoma.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.104
- The only thing
I can think of is that

00:36.137 --> 00:39.640
she's completely wrapped
around this guy's finger.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.309
- Let this not be, like,
one of those trips

00:41.342 --> 00:42.710
where she's just like,

00:42.743 --> 00:44.478
"Well, I don't want to do,
like, certain things."

00:44.512 --> 00:46.247
- I'm not jumping
in freezing cold water.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.748
My teeth are way too sensitive.

00:47.781 --> 00:51.252
One of those,
I will be hung over.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.986
- Why didn't you sit by me
on the plane, Jax?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.122
- Babe, we live together,

00:54.155 --> 00:55.489
sleep together,
eat together, play together.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.158
I'm sure you'll be okay
for 45 minutes on a flight

00:57.191 --> 00:58.659
and be all right.
- So annoyed.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.894
- Everything's finally going
right, but oh what do I do?

01:00.928 --> 01:03.897
I got to f--- this up somehow,
because that's what Jax does.

and I felt so fine,

01:34.628 --> 01:36.464
and I was like "God, I can't
believe I'm not hungover.

I'm just, like, chipper,
like, what?"

01:39.167 --> 01:42.370
And now I, like, feel like
the queasiness, like, coming in.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.972
This was supposed to be four
girls in serious relationships

01:45.005 --> 01:46.340
going on a girls' trip.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.942
Now it's three girls in serious
relationships

01:48.976 --> 01:50.378
and me.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.780
Thank God we didn't invite
all of the men in our lives,

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515

You want me to try?

02:04.858 --> 02:06.194
What's happening?

02:06.194 --> 02:07.261

What the f---?

02:08.529 --> 02:11.265
- Katie, you're almost there.
I heard it.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.933
- Well, that was really
anti-climactic.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.202
- Yes!

02:15.303 --> 02:16.837
Did Scheana have fun
last night?

02:16.870 --> 02:17.971
- I think so.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.006
- Well, you wouldn't remember.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.541
- Did I yell at you?

02:20.574 --> 02:21.942
- Not in, like,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.512
full-blown tequila Katie way.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.613
You scare me.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.281

I can't go out with you

02:27.315 --> 02:28.716
unless I, like, commit

02:28.749 --> 02:30.284
to, like, seriously,

02:30.318 --> 02:32.453
like, being on the prowl.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.223

- Ugh!

02:36.324 --> 02:38.226
Stop!

02:38.226 --> 02:41.128
Patrick and I were together
for three years.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.464
And I'm not like
the type of person

02:43.497 --> 02:46.234
that just, like,
makes out with random people.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.701
But I want a distraction

02:47.735 --> 02:49.470
'cause
I really don't want to be sad.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.605
What do I tell guys
when I meet them?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.874
- So you should be--
- Well, I spray tan once a week,

02:53.907 --> 02:55.576
I love a good blowout.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.745
- This is not things
that they--

02:57.778 --> 03:00.314
- And my exercise
is shopping online.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.649
- That is not what you say.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.116
It's exactly not what you say.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.386
- But that's who I am.
- They don't--

03:05.419 --> 03:07.355
I know but it--
- And I'm really into murder.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.090

03:10.123 --> 03:11.592
- Oh, my God.
Who would date me?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.993
- Don't say
you're into murder,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.363
'cause that is weird as f---.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.530
Say that you're into,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.333
like, scary movies and,
like, mysteries...

03:19.367 --> 03:20.601

- Haunted houses...

03:20.634 --> 03:22.336
- Zombies.
- Ghosts and paranormal.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.872
- Cemeteries.
- Okay, but avoid being creepy.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.774
Don't say, like,
you enjoy cemeteries.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.108
That's weird.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.278
I really want to help Stassi
feel better

03:30.278 --> 03:32.380
and get over her breakup
by bugging the sh--

03:32.413 --> 03:35.416
out of her until her tongue
is down some stranger's throat.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.184

let it snowball and,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.419
like, come up with new ideas.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.854
- Don't let it snowball
too much...

03:40.888 --> 03:42.189
- Okay.

Oh, come on.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.171
- [laughs]
Don't dude, come on.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.707
- That fridge stinks, dude.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.975
- Dude, it's literally
smells so bad.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.511

04:03.544 --> 04:05.212

and we are barely
clinging to our humanity.

who eats Cheetos

04:10.318 --> 04:13.053
and Pringles first thing
in the morning.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.423
- I mean, Lord help us.
- Why don't you go up there

04:15.456 --> 04:17.691
and get the rest of our stuff
off the top?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.527
That'd be really cool.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.661
- No, I want to fold
my clothes first.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.862
- I'm doing it.
- Come on.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.631
- Go up there and get
the stuff off the bed.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.965
- I'm gonna help you fold.
- Just wait, hold on.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.133
- Hold on, I'm gonna
help you fold.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.401
- No, you don't even know
how to fold.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.802
- I have stuff everywhere.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.538
It should be nice and folded
tightly. We have lots of stuff.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.239
- It is.
This is all on the f---ing side.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.974
You're about to make me
go insane, seriously.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.343
- Yeah, but you
shouldn't have to.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.177
We didn't use the other side.
- Yes, we did.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.546
- No.
- Yes, we did.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.847
- I thought--
- This something to argue about?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.181
- No, it's not.
That's why this is so stupid.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.650
- No, my shoes are
going in there.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.685
So pull it all out
and then refold it back in.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.819
Like this--makes it easier.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.220
- Yeah, that makes it
a lot easier.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.122
- Then you just refold it all
and put it back in.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.992
How hard is that?
- Jax should zip his mouth.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.127
- He doesn't know how to zip
his mouth, that's his issue.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.729
Let me just do this
on my own.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.864

04:56.897 --> 04:58.231
- What are you still
harping over me?

04:58.265 --> 05:01.034
Shut up.
- You guys, stop bickering.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.471
- Jax and Brittany need
a goddamn time-out right now.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.706
- We got to refold everything.
- No!

05:05.739 --> 05:07.375
I can't stand you barking
in my ear.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.777
- They need to find
their respective corners

05:09.810 --> 05:12.145
and take a little space,
you know? Chill out.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.947
- Whose idea
was it to get an RV?

05:15.383 --> 05:16.384

Ah!

05:19.453 --> 05:22.055

in four-minute intervals,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.065
there's a lot of people.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.834
I don't even know
if I would consider us

05:33.867 --> 05:36.303
to be civilized
human beings anymore.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.105
It's every man for himself.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.573
- I'm going--
I'm just rinsing my body

05:39.607 --> 05:40.608
and washing my face
really quick.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.675
- It's not really
an easy process.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.312
- Turn the water
off and on.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.580
- I turned it off
a long time ago.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.015
- These kind of showers
don't work for people

05:48.048 --> 05:49.149
like you that take
eight-hour long showers.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.418
- Yeah.
- You just got to wait it out.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.985
There's a beer in there.
Go ahead; have a drink.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.589
- I swear it's turned on.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.891
- It's on, honey,
we're waiting on you, per usual.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.560
- Oh, Jax.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.697
- Jax can't just keep laying
into Brittany all the time.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.933
Because if he keeps
giving her sh--,

06:05.966 --> 06:07.435
she's not gonna stick around.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.236
- You just got to rinse off
and call it a day.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.905
- I'll give you
a bottle of water.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.340
- There's that one,
and that one right there.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.742
- Just give her a bunch
of water bottles.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.448
[laughter]

06:20.448 --> 06:23.717
- Jax can honestly be
the sweetest, most generous,

06:23.751 --> 06:24.785
loving guy,

06:24.818 --> 06:26.620
but then he can also be

06:26.654 --> 06:29.523
the biggest asshole
on the planet.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.492
- Savage life.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.464
*

06:36.464 --> 06:37.498
- Oh, here we go.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.133
Hey, kids,
who wants margaritas?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.102
- I just feel bad we didn't
bring them any liquor.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.839
- I've heard that Montauk
is, like, "Waspy,"

06:45.873 --> 06:49.309
but I have no idea
what "Waspy" means.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.512
I'm assuming that it means,
like, bougie,

06:51.545 --> 06:54.281
but wasps suck.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.317
So I hope Montauk doesn't suck.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.352
- Can't stay here very long

06:59.386 --> 07:02.389
'cause I was texting
with the Wirkus twins earlier.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.624
Basically they said

07:03.657 --> 07:06.760
that they're throwing
a clambake on the beach.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.861
- What the hell is a clambake?

07:07.895 --> 07:09.129
- I don't know.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.799
I would imagine
it's like a crawfish boil,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.767
like, in New Orleans
except, like, with clams.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.236
- Like a luau?
- No, not a luau, like, it's--

07:16.269 --> 07:18.138
- Like, how they roast a pig,
like, in stones

07:18.171 --> 07:19.640
and, like,
under the sand and stuff?

07:19.673 --> 07:23.911
- I don't--I mean, clams aren't
really like an animal so,

07:23.944 --> 07:26.013
like, we don't have to worry
about that, no.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.147
Let's Google what
clambakes are.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.348
I don't know.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.416
- Yeah, I don't even know
what that is.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.018
- We're so
not East Coast.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.052
- No.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.821
- It's an outdoor
social gathering

07:33.854 --> 07:35.155
at which clams

07:35.188 --> 07:37.691
and other seafood
are baked or steamed.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.727
- What if we don't like clams?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.531
- You're gonna pretend
like you do.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.532
- Yeah, but--

07:44.565 --> 07:45.899
- We'll all take one
for the team.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.034
- I'm sorry.
I'm not a seafood person.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.836

it's just not my thing.

such negative Nancies?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.812
- I'm excited,
that sounds great.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.280
- I did not say a word.
- It's her,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.583
but I just felt bad
pointing just her out.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.784
- I don't like clams,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.185
but I'm excited to go
to a clambake.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.588
- I say let's make an effort
to be social

08:07.621 --> 08:09.356
and put ourselves out there.
- She's talking to you, Scheana.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.725

15:15.715 --> 15:18.018
- I, like, can't get over that.
- Help me understand L.A.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.586
- Every day is like
y'all's Saturday.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.388
- Is like, let's go.
[laughter]

15:22.722 --> 15:24.524
- Yeah.
And none of us have real jobs.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.994
- We have Sunday fun days
because on Monday

15:26.994 --> 15:28.695
we have to literally get up--

15:28.728 --> 15:30.430
we're getting up at 5:00 a.m.
tomorrow to drive--

15:30.463 --> 15:32.265
- We're driving,
oh no we're getting up at 4:00.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.601
- Monday is my favorite day
out of the week.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.170
I'm just not a 9:00 to 5:00
type of person.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.572
I love to sleep in.
I like to stay up late.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.308
I like to go out
during the week.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.643
So I don't know how the f---
they do it.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.113
It's great money,
but that sucks to be you.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.720

Oh, my gosh, it's, like,
prepared. Thank you so much.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.224
- Have here a tuna.
- Oh, no thank you.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.758
- Yeah.
- I mean, they're all good.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
- Um, I don't really eat fish.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.697
- Really?
You don't eat fish?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.233
- I just--I don't like it.
I don't know.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.700
- This is phenomenal.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.870
- Oh, my God, look at Stephen
in his selfie with a lobster.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.706
- Okay, so I know
you all needed a refill.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.542
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!

16:15.575 --> 16:17.777
- I had to give you the
magnum rosé for your birthday.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.811
- Happy birthday, Stassi!

16:18.845 --> 16:21.348
- So, you get to pour
the first drink.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.782
- This is amazing.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.085
- Quick, chug it.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.354
- Wait, lower it, lower it,
lower it.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.856
A magnum bottle of rosé?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.624
- To East Coast to West Coast.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.726
- Best summer ever.
- Happy birthday, Stassi.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.828
- Best summer ever.
- Thank you guys.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.198
I've never felt more
at home anywhere.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.200
This is my first time
doing this.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.369
Is there, like, a certain way
you're supposed to eat it?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.736
- Well, you know
how crawfish you, like, have to,

16:43.770 --> 16:45.072
like, suck things out.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.706
- There's no sucking
things out today.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.775
- No, let's not go that far.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.809
[laughter]

16:49.842 --> 16:51.578
- This is so good.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.147
- I can't eat food like that.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.416
I just do not like it.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.218
You should never
eat anything with claws.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.387
I mean, are you gonna eat a cat?
No.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.090
So why would you eat something
from the ocean with claws

17:03.123 --> 17:04.957
and, like, that just--

17:04.991 --> 17:07.094
I don't--I'm sorry,
I don't want to eat it.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.328
Are those all the same thing?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.097
Why do they have
different colored shells?

17:10.097 --> 17:11.564
- 'Cause they're clams
and mussels.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.333
- I remember I used
to serve mussels as a--

17:13.366 --> 17:14.601
- No.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.969
- Would you try one?
- No. Not a chance in hell.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.372
- What are you--
- It's a very colorful table.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.108
I'm gonna go get
more rosé.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.243
- These people
planned this party for us,

17:23.276 --> 17:25.512
and you're saying,
"I don't eat food like this."

17:27.914 --> 17:30.817
- It's a lot to deal with
and a lot of work.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.252
- Just present it to me.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.021
Sunflower seeds, I want to
buy them already cracked.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.356

There he goes!

17:52.205 --> 17:53.173
- Yeah.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.741
All right, final lap.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.284
- This right here,
this is why we did the RV.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.419
This is why we put up with dirt

18:06.453 --> 18:09.656
and boy smell,
so that we could be here

18:09.689 --> 18:12.759
right now
with this amazing view.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.026
- Oh...
He dodged him, bro.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.762
- He rubbed him!
- Holy sh--.

- You're already tired,
that's cool.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.181
- I got to pee.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.649
Dude, the toilet's clogged.
- Yep.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.385
- It's f---ing clogged,
dude.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.620
- Sh--.
All right. Piece of paper.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.191
- I knew it was gonna
get stank nasty in that RV...

18:44.224 --> 18:46.793
- We're in lot 42.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.028
All right, all right,
I'll see you in 15.

18:49.061 --> 18:52.432
- But I didn't know
how stank nasty.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.269
- All right, how are we doing?
You sucking it out?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.472
- We always sing this song.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.008

* Save that poo for later

* Save that poo

counts in this situation.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.061
- I agree.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.129
- Thank you.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.964
- All right, well.
- Whoo!

19:24.997 --> 19:28.301
- Well?
- It's a nice little $150 sh--.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.470
- Exactly.
- I think it was Jax.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.139
He's an excessive
toilet paper user.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.542
He uses, like,
a half a roll on that ass.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.944
- Hey, we got a reservation
at Hilltop 1892.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.145
It's a nice little--

19:39.246 --> 19:40.947
- It's the real deal.
- Nice, you guys

and freshen up a little.

quick showers.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.818
- Seriously, Jax.
- You know what?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.820
I think it's Brittany's fault,
actually.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.121
- Jax maybe you
would've scolded her

19:49.155 --> 19:51.258
a little more, it might have
helped a little better.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.459
- Yeah, we would've been
in a better position.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.993
- You've got to
belittle her more.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.128
- It just goes to show that
I'm not being crazy.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.697
I think that Jax
needs to get over this.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.500
He needs to grow up
and respect his girlfriend.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.968
Yeah, you little asshole.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.603
- You little asshole.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.004
- Coming up...

20:05.037 --> 20:06.439
- You knew I was going away
for Ariana's birthday.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.140
- Yes, I do know
they were disappointed.

The summer house just started
and Carl is making moves.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.635
Carl, you professed

20:35.668 --> 20:37.604
that yesterday blondes
weren't your thing.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.238
- Ooh, explain why.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.773
- It's confusing
for guys.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.942
- No, it's actually does
the carpet match the drapes?

20:42.975 --> 20:45.378
[laughter]
- Wait.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.246
- Maybe she has hardwood floors.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.915
[laughter]

20:48.948 --> 20:50.917
- Okay, so has anyone
at the table banged?

20:52.885 --> 20:54.754
- Oh, wow.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.255
Well, they're dating
at the end,

20:56.289 --> 20:58.325
Everett and Lindsay,
so they've definitely banged.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.059
Katie, when's the wedding?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.528
- August 17th.
- Wow.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.396
This will be
your best summer ever.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.097
- It already has been.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.333
- So I'm totally outnumbered.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.634
I'm the only
married girl here.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.635
- No, you're not.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.503
- Oh, sorry, Scheana too.
Sorry.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.210
- I'm, going through
a very recent breakup right now.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.211
- Oh, really?
- I'm sorry.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.415
- Yeah.
- Why did you guys break up?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.216
- I'll start crying,
can we not talk about it?

21:24.250 --> 21:25.685
- Sorry, never mind.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.420
Never mind.
- Sorry.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.697
It's really hard because
my family really likes Patrick,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.165
and my friends like him too.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.633
And I'm used to people
just being like

21:40.667 --> 21:42.101
"Your boyfriend's an asshole."

21:42.134 --> 21:44.604
And so what happens if I wake up
a year from now, I'm like,

21:44.637 --> 21:47.173
"that was a f---ing huge
mistake to break up."

21:47.206 --> 21:48.841
I was on, like, a dating app,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.411
and I literally--I feel
like I could barely,

21:51.444 --> 21:52.945
like, like one person.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.547
- Oh, you're on an app?
You don't need it.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.583
Whatever happened
to "Hi, how are you?"

21:56.616 --> 21:58.250
- 'Cause I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

21:58.284 --> 22:01.187
I feel, like, so, like,
he's calling me out

22:01.220 --> 22:04.256
for being on an app, WTF?

22:04.290 --> 22:06.158
- Stassi needs some tough love.

22:06.192 --> 22:09.896
She needs to sack up
and hop in the sack.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.399
She doesn't need to go that far
but maybe, like,

22:12.399 --> 22:15.535
a hand on the boob
or, like, an OTPHJ,

22:15.568 --> 22:16.903
which is
an over the pant hand job.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.138
I'm a little jealous
that they get to come out here

22:19.171 --> 22:20.607
every weekend
and do stuff like this.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.008
- Yeah, I know.

You think we should have
chosen to have,

22:23.710 --> 22:25.445
like, real, like,
legit careers,

22:25.478 --> 22:27.814
like, kinds where you have
to go to, like, grad school?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.949
Or, like, get PhDs?

22:29.982 --> 22:31.250
- No, I don't wish that.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.786
You think that there's
some talent here

22:33.820 --> 22:36.423
for you to exercise
your singleness in?

22:36.423 --> 22:37.490
- The one right in front of me

22:37.524 --> 22:39.125
is who I would normally
go for.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.027
He made fun of me
for being on a dating app.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.431
- Well, the one that
was sitting--is it Kyle?

22:44.431 --> 22:45.698
- Yeah.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.434
You know when you have, like,
a bad sense of direction

22:47.434 --> 22:48.801
you always go the wrong way?

22:48.835 --> 22:51.904
So, go the opposite way.
And that's Kyle.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.606

- How did you not
get burned, Ariana?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.878
- Me? I never burn.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.013
- Hi.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.281
- Hello, hello, good,
my name's John.

23:35.314 --> 23:36.516
I'll be your server
this evening.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.817
- Can we start off
with the charcuterie board?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.486
- Charcuterie, perfect.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.753
- What's a charcut--what's that?

23:40.787 --> 23:43.022
- Charcuterie is like
a cheese and meat plate.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.491
- A charcuterie?

23:44.491 --> 23:47.560
- Could I please have
the homemade ravioli?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.562
- Whoa!
- Yes, I love it!

23:49.596 --> 23:50.997
I've never seen you
order pasta.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.198
- Very good.
- I just got to say

23:52.231 --> 23:54.066
you girls have been really,
really awesome.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.302
- Dude, Jax, you, dude,

23:56.335 --> 23:58.404
you f---ing tortured
her this morning.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.272
Such a f---ing asshole.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.041
- No, I'm glad
that people realize this

24:02.074 --> 24:03.676
and you actually tell him.
- You were, like, getting off.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.277
The more annoyed
she got the more you were,

24:05.311 --> 24:06.278
like, getting off on it.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.514
- That's what
you did to me.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.115
Brittany, what do you think
about the fact

24:09.148 --> 24:10.717
that he says things like
"You know,

24:10.750 --> 24:13.185
"I come home,
I kind of, like,

24:13.219 --> 24:15.588
expect a sandwich
to be made."

24:15.622 --> 24:17.724
- If I'm supporting
your lifestyle,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.559
meaning financially,
all this other stuff,

24:19.592 --> 24:22.629
I think once in a while
if I want a sandwich--

24:22.662 --> 24:25.331
- And I do that,
and I give you money.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.800
- Honey, let's not get
into our finances.

24:27.834 --> 24:28.968
- If I were Brittany, Jax would

24:29.001 --> 24:31.170
either be bleeding
or dead right now.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.405
- Jax, you have
to understand something.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.542
You can't and you
shouldn't talk like that.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.076
- Whoa, no, no, no, no.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.911
My relationship
is my relationship.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.613
You can't tell me
how to handle my--

24:40.647 --> 24:41.914
- Okay, fine.
- You do you, I'll do me.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.351
- Favors and gifts
are not leverage.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.553
- Tom likes to act like

24:46.553 --> 24:48.020
he has a perfect relationship
with Ariana,

24:48.054 --> 24:49.989
but it's a regular relationship.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.323
They have their fights too.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.325
If I ask once in a while, "Hey,
can I have a sandwich?

24:53.359 --> 24:54.627
Or do you mind
doing my laundry as well,"

24:54.661 --> 24:56.929
dude, I would go--
I would bow down.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.065
If I was in a reverse situation,
if I was that person

24:59.098 --> 25:01.568
I'd be like hell,
yeah, my life's great.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.436
- Don't talk about it like that.
- Brittany is mad down there.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.573
- Oh, she's not mad.
- For Jax to embarrass me

25:06.573 --> 25:08.407
in front
of a whole group of friends

25:08.440 --> 25:10.943
and just say things that need
to be only between me and him,

25:10.977 --> 25:12.344
it really pisses me off.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.013
- No, we have a good weekend,

25:14.046 --> 25:15.014
we're gonna end
on a good weekend.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.249
It was all just fun and games.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.651
- Whoa, we're just on our way--
- It's not fun and games

25:18.685 --> 25:19.686
when you talk sh--

25:19.719 --> 25:21.120
about me in front of
a whole table.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.755
- Just trust me, Brittany,
everything that's coming out

25:22.789 --> 25:24.657
of his mouth
is not making you look bad.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.492
- I don't need
relationship advice.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.594
I don't. No, I don't.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.795
- I'm not giving you
relationship advice.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.196
- I don't.
Please, I don't, please.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.631
- You just don't take it
as far as you do sometimes.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.165
- Huh?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
- You don't need to take it
as far as you do sometimes.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.035
- I don't know how this turned
against me all of a sudden here

25:36.068 --> 25:37.469
because I'm about ready
to walk out in two seconds.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.973
*

25:41.007 --> 25:42.508
When I first started
dating Brittany,

25:42.609 --> 25:44.911
one of the best things I loved
about her is she's not from L.A.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.646
She was, you know,
a country girl

25:46.679 --> 25:48.414
and she's just sweet,
innocent.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.617
And I think as the more
she hangs out with these girls

25:50.617 --> 25:52.752
I feel like
a little bit

25:52.785 --> 25:55.221
she's kind of adapting a little
bit of the L.A. traits,

25:55.254 --> 25:57.489
and it kind of
really annoys me.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.626
- Cheers to a great weekend.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.761
Cheers to Lala
missing the f--- out

26:01.794 --> 26:03.863
because she doesn't
know what's going on.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.765
She's obviously bored.
- Hey, you know what?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.266
In honor of that,
I don't know

26:07.299 --> 26:10.002
when this happened--
but I realized

26:10.036 --> 26:13.405
that Lala no longer
follows me on Instagram.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.642
- Yep.
- Then I went on Twitter.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.010
She no longer follows me
on Twitter either.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.478
Pretty confused
with Lala because

26:19.511 --> 26:21.447
I thought
we were friends.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.883
Now this bitch
is trying to ice me out

26:23.916 --> 26:27.820
by unfriending me
on all of her social media?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.421
I'm not following her anymore.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.923
I just unfollowed her
on Instagram.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.191
- Whoa.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.661
- I mean, bitch,
if you want to be petty,

26:34.661 --> 26:37.029
I can get real petty.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.264
So guess what?

26:38.297 --> 26:39.732
I'm gonna unfollow you.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.802
- A line has been drawn
in the sand.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.805
[upbeat music]

26:45.838 --> 26:52.845
*

26:54.747 --> 26:55.782
- Hi, Peter.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.950
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.251
- You were off all weekend.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.486
You should be a lot happier

27:00.519 --> 27:01.988
when you come
into work afterwards.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.355
- Yeah, you would think so.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.457
- So I'm guessing you
came to talk to Lisa, right?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.326
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.461
- I decided to
turn my phone off,

27:09.495 --> 27:11.330
not communicate with anybody,

27:11.363 --> 27:12.999
because that's what Lala does

27:13.032 --> 27:14.533
when she doesn't want
to do something.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.736
She doesn't do it and,

27:16.769 --> 27:18.971
you know,
she goes into shutdown mode.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.408
- Oh, Lala's here to see you.
- Oh, she is?

27:22.441 --> 27:23.710
You know what?
I'm gonna sit there.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.077
Do me a favor,
get me a cup of tea.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.146
- Okay.
- When Lala doesn't show up

27:27.179 --> 27:28.380
to go to Sonoma,

27:28.414 --> 27:30.116
and she specifically asked me
for time off,

27:30.149 --> 27:33.152
it makes me think of her
as a little erratic,

27:33.185 --> 27:36.288
and I actually don't
quite understand

27:36.322 --> 27:38.057
anything Lala's doing right now.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.259
- Um, so--

27:40.292 --> 27:41.728
- Yeah, what's going on?

27:41.728 --> 27:43.129
- You know I was going away
for Ariana's birthday?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.197
- Yes, but if you ask
for time off,

27:45.231 --> 27:47.566
you do what you want, but I do
know they were disappointed.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.235
- Understandably.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.903
I care about Tom,
I care about Ariana...

27:50.937 --> 27:52.872
- They care about you.
- They're still my friends.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.741
I should've told them,
"Invite someone else

27:54.774 --> 27:56.743
"because I don't want
to be around Jax,

27:56.776 --> 27:59.145
"who the last time
I saw him you had an entire,

27:59.178 --> 28:00.947
full lounge and he yelled--"

28:00.980 --> 28:04.050
- Go suck some more d---
for Range Rovers. Yeah.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.119
- Asshole. Across the bar,
with a full lounge, okay?

28:07.153 --> 28:08.888
- Okay, I didn't
hear about that.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.457
- That's the last time
we spoke to each other.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.292
- Well then why did you agree
to go in the first place?

28:13.325 --> 28:16.763
- Ask you questions--you--
and I'm not saying--

28:16.763 --> 28:17.764
- Say it, Lala.

28:17.797 --> 28:18.898
- Over the weekend--
- What is it?

28:18.931 --> 28:19.932
Why are you gonna cry?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.667
- Because of what
they're saying.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.135
- Who's saying?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.171
- That I'm a homewrecker
to this guy.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.373
It's just--I can't do this.
I've lost--

28:27.406 --> 28:30.176
- What guy?

28:30.209 --> 28:32.278
- This person who's not
even involved with me.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.214
- Okay, so you're talking
about somebody like Jax...

28:35.247 --> 28:36.816
- All of them!
- Just because he says it...

28:36.849 --> 28:38.150
- All of them,
going around town.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.386
- Just because he says it,
doesn't make it true.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.888
Does it make it true?
- I know that.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.089
- I don't know if the rumors

28:43.122 --> 28:45.457
about Lala dating
a married man are true.

28:45.491 --> 28:46.893
I hope not.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.695
And I hope not because
of the wife involved,

28:49.796 --> 28:53.432
but I also hope not because
she should be better than that.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.534
She should have more than that.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.569
And she should have
more respect for herself.

28:57.603 --> 28:58.871
So if you're telling--

28:58.905 --> 29:00.206
- I tell people
it's none of their business,

29:00.239 --> 29:01.874
and then
they want to jump on it,

29:01.908 --> 29:02.975
"But we're friends,
buh, buh, buh."

29:03.009 --> 29:04.443
So, you know what?
This is fun for me.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.812
It's like an acting job.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.613
I'm dating the Pope.
I'm dating the mayor.

29:07.646 --> 29:08.815
I'm dating a football player.

29:08.848 --> 29:09.949
I'm dating another
football player.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.117
I'm dating an NBA player.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.584
Let's just go
all across the board

29:12.618 --> 29:15.321
so everyone can shut up and give
them something to talk about.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.623
- But I do believe,
I really do, I think

29:17.656 --> 29:21.027
when somebody feels like
they catch you in a lie

29:21.060 --> 29:23.963
then they don't know
what part to believe,

29:23.996 --> 29:27.599
you know, they don't know
how much to invest in you.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.836
- So over it.
- So, who are you, Lala?

29:29.836 --> 29:31.703
I have a certain amount
of sympathy for Lala,

29:31.737 --> 29:33.605
but she's
definitely provocative.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.341
She likes to create a situation

29:35.374 --> 29:37.043
and then she likes
to be the baby girl.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.444
Well, life doesn't
work like that.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.412
- I think it's best for me

29:40.446 --> 29:42.281
to walk away
from this workplace.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.855
- Coming up...

29:48.888 --> 29:50.256
- I don't like feeling like
I'm not appreciated.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.858
And sometimes I feel
that way with him.

29:59.866 --> 30:00.199
[upbeat music]

30:03.202 --> 30:05.071
- I think it's best

30:05.104 --> 30:07.339
for me to walk away
from this workplace.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.244
- Lala, f---ing give up?

30:12.278 --> 30:14.780
What's wrong with you?

30:14.813 --> 30:18.284
Time to grow up now
and deal with it.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.086
You know what?
You're gonna be the prettiest,

30:20.119 --> 30:21.687
cutest little thing
running around

30:21.720 --> 30:23.822
like a lovely little piece
of fluff in Hollywood

30:23.856 --> 30:25.457
getting the lead,

30:25.491 --> 30:27.894
or starting to be
the rising star,

30:27.927 --> 30:29.661
you think everybody's
gonna be your friend?

30:29.695 --> 30:32.398
Really? Do you?

30:32.431 --> 30:36.435
- No. I just want--I mean,

30:36.468 --> 30:39.205
I haven't had a functioning
relationship since I was 17.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.940
- It's got nothing
to do with them.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.608
- No, it has everything
to do with me.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.477
I'm in charge of my emotions
and what goes on and I...

30:45.511 --> 30:46.578
- Say it again.
- Am trying.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.579
- Say it again.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.849
- I am in charge
of my own emotions.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.851
- Right, go to that desk,

30:52.885 --> 30:54.686
hold your head up high.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.088
If you quit, you're gonna

30:56.122 --> 30:57.890
give some people
a lot of satisfaction

30:57.924 --> 31:00.359
and I don't think
you want to do that.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.760
It's true.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.030
- No, I think that's--I
should've had this conversation

31:04.063 --> 31:05.531
with you a long time ago.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.467
- Your mother or somebody else
should've had this conversation

31:08.500 --> 31:09.936
with you a long time ago.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.738
- I walk in with every
intention of quitting,

31:12.771 --> 31:15.007
but there's something
about this woman

31:15.041 --> 31:18.777
that I just feel safe,

31:18.810 --> 31:23.082
and what she's telling me
is pretty on-point.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.716
So I'm not quitting today, Lisa.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.552
- Go on, just go, do your thing.
- Okay.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.493

31:34.526 --> 31:38.030
* We won't stop coming alive

31:38.064 --> 31:39.765
- Honestly, like, I like
the girl that was single

31:39.798 --> 31:41.300
and I think her name
was Saucy.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.868
- [laughs]
Saucy.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.704
- I like the girl
that has boobs.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.340
- S-T-A-S-S-I.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.875
Not "Saucy."

31:49.976 --> 31:53.045
- Jesus Christ, what is this?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.446
- Dude, it's a mansion.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.115
- Guys, look at the pool.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.617
- Holy sh--.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.452
It's bigger than
my apartment complex,

32:00.486 --> 32:02.288
and this is just
their vacation home?

32:02.321 --> 32:04.690
It's like Lisa
Vanderpump's house.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.425
- Saucy, Stassi,
what is that?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.994
- Yes.
That's her name.

- Hi!
- What's up?

32:14.866 --> 32:16.435
Why is your house this big?
- I know.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.504
- Are you guys dying?
- When you guys said

32:18.537 --> 32:20.206
that you rented a house,

32:20.239 --> 32:22.008
my apartment
is, like, this.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.209
- In New York City, though,
you guys,

32:23.242 --> 32:25.011
we all live in shoeboxes.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.245
- Oh, no, I remember.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.480
I had to go to Starbucks
in order to go number two.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.482
[laughter]
So I'm very much aware of that.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.085
- Can we get a drink before
we do, like, a tour?

32:33.119 --> 32:35.254
- Yeah, over here.
Guys, they're here.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.570
- You were expecting me?

32:51.603 --> 32:52.571
- Scheana doesn't have one.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.306
- Scheana,
do you like margaritas?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.042
- Do you have a straw?

32:56.042 --> 32:58.477
Damn, I mean I had a house
pictured in my head

32:58.510 --> 32:59.845
that was, like, half this size,

32:59.878 --> 33:03.049
but this sh-- is unbelievable.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.284
- This is, like,
a little sun gazebo

33:05.317 --> 33:06.918
you can kind of chill out.

33:06.952 --> 33:09.388
- This is like
the boom-boom room, right?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.923
Like, I would totally
have sex in this room.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.259
- Yeah.
- Look at her passing out.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.194
- I love this house so much.

33:15.227 --> 33:19.231

I'm in the wrong business.

- Ashley, Ashley.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.339
- I mean you could put,
like, a little more in there.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.440
- There is--
- I think everyone else

33:28.474 --> 33:29.508
should get in their bikinis

33:29.541 --> 33:31.077
and get ready
to go jump in the pool.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.511

of this ever?

33:32.544 --> 33:35.114
- We have a--
- No, it's too far.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.782
- We need to make sure

33:36.815 --> 33:39.785
that, like,
the fun meter stays high.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.122
- [laughs]

33:43.155 --> 33:45.157
- Is that your normal
sized glass?

33:45.191 --> 33:49.395
- This is actually
how I go with usually.

33:49.428 --> 33:53.532
I just happened to notice
for one of the first times ever,

33:53.565 --> 33:55.101

have a hot friend.

- It's been a great trip.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.216
Did you guys bone in there?

34:10.249 --> 34:12.218
- Kind of.
- Did you?

34:12.251 --> 34:14.220
I laid in that bed earlier.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.521
I put my face--

34:15.554 --> 34:17.723
literally, I had my face
buried in that bed earlier.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.526

- Yeah.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.897
- Well, did you have fun?

34:25.931 --> 34:27.833
- Had the best time.
- You're tired?

34:27.866 --> 34:30.269
- One of my favorite things
earlier

34:30.302 --> 34:31.503
it was making me laugh so hard

34:31.537 --> 34:34.373
'cause, like,
Jax was saying stuff,

34:34.406 --> 34:36.775
and you were, like,
pissed but you'd be like...

34:36.808 --> 34:39.145
- Oh, God, I'm so pissed.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.146
- It's rude.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.013
It's also, like,
gender roles

34:42.047 --> 34:43.882
ingrained in his head

34:43.915 --> 34:46.051
of what a woman should be doing,

34:46.152 --> 34:47.386
what a man should be doing,

34:47.419 --> 34:50.522
and, like,
these misogynistic tendencies.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.592
- What is a misogynistic mean?

34:53.625 --> 34:55.827
- [laughs]

34:55.861 --> 34:57.729
- Every night? I don't know,
what does that mean?

34:57.763 --> 34:59.565
I've never heard
that word before.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.833
- It's like being sexist
basically, it's--

35:01.867 --> 35:03.335
- Okay.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.003
- Roast some marshmallows.
- I think it's premature.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.272
- That's what I said when
I j----- off in your mom's p---.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.839
- He knows moms.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.441
- Shut up, that's too far.
- I did. I prematurely came.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.743
I didn't want to, I just had to.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.312
- I don't like feeling like
I'm not appreciated,

35:13.345 --> 35:15.381
and sometimes I feel
that way with him.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.049
- Yeah, what are you gonna do
if he doesn't change that stuff?

35:18.083 --> 35:20.486
- Obviously we're not gonna stay
together if we're not happy.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.288
- Jax, you really should
get your sh-- together,

35:22.321 --> 35:23.722
because Brittany is honestly
the best thing

35:23.755 --> 35:24.956
that's ever happened to you,

35:24.990 --> 35:26.958
and I don't want to see you
f--- this up.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.394
- Just, like, sometimes, like,

35:28.427 --> 35:31.730
the comments and stuff
is just, like... can't.

35:31.763 --> 35:32.798

35:52.784 --> 35:54.220

- So they have

35:54.220 --> 35:57.088
the best natural boobs ever.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.524

- Holy sh--.
- They're real.

and chattering indistinctly]

36:15.106 --> 36:16.074
- That was good.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.343
- If you poured me a little bit,

36:17.376 --> 36:18.577
which you just did right now...

36:18.610 --> 36:19.911
- No, yeah.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.046
- And you did that--
- That's not a little bit.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.481
- What are you
talking about, Kyle?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.015
- Like, came in
the house earlier today

36:24.049 --> 36:25.951
before you guys
got here, Stassi,

36:25.984 --> 36:27.486
and he said,
"Oh, my gosh, your friend,

36:27.519 --> 36:30.055
she's so beautiful
and she's single."

36:30.088 --> 36:32.258
He's hitting on you,
that's his way.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.827
- You're fine.
- I touched--to touch.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.829
Kyle's giving me some attention,

36:37.863 --> 36:40.131
which is making me
nervous as f---!

36:42.368 --> 36:43.369
- Right, anyways.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.636
- Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?

36:44.670 --> 36:48.073
Just be confident
in who you are.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.708
- I got this.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.844
*

36:52.878 --> 36:54.280
- Full of life.
- Schwartz,

36:54.280 --> 36:56.348
bring those f---ing leather
nut-huggers down here.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.616
[laughter]

36:57.649 --> 36:59.184
Look at those leather shorts.

36:59.285 --> 37:02.654
- Yeah, yeah!
Look at that ass!

37:02.688 --> 37:04.723
Oh, look at those legs!

37:04.756 --> 37:06.425
- [grunts]

37:06.458 --> 37:08.294
Oh.
Did you have fun?

37:08.327 --> 37:09.761
- Yeah.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.364
Other than your little 'tude

37:12.398 --> 37:13.865
that you have
every now and then.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.534
- It happens,
it's just part of life.

37:15.567 --> 37:19.037
- And you were just, like,
hollering about, like, finances

37:19.070 --> 37:22.508
and me not doing this and that
in front of the entire table.

37:22.541 --> 37:23.742
Sometimes I just feel like...

37:23.775 --> 37:25.611
- Okay.
- I'm not appreciated enough.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.646
- I feel like I'm not
appreciated sometimes.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.180
- Whatever, that's not true.
- You know,

37:29.214 --> 37:31.550
sometimes I ask for a turkey
sandwich and I only get ham.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.119
I think it's being a little bit
misconstruded a little bit.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.488
I'm not saying every single day
at 3:00 in the afternoon

37:36.522 --> 37:37.856
I want a sandwich on the plate.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.359
If the roles were reversed,
I'd be like, "Listen.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.528
I'm gonna make sure that he has
a nice lunch every day."

37:42.561 --> 37:44.062
I say once in a while
I want to come home, like,

37:44.095 --> 37:45.964
be nice to have lunch there,
that's all,

37:45.997 --> 37:47.533
especially when I pay the rent,
I pay the bills,

37:47.566 --> 37:48.934
I pay this, I do that, that.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.336
You don't pay anything,
don't do anything.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.404
- And I do know that you do
a sh-- ton for me,

37:52.438 --> 37:54.373
but you also need to respect me

37:54.406 --> 37:56.007
and realize
that I do a lot for you, too.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.909
Don't have this,
like, attitude to

37:57.943 --> 38:00.178
where you are holding stuff
over my head.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.780
I mean, like,
for instance my boob job.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.782
Sometimes you're like,
"Well, I paid for those."

38:03.815 --> 38:04.983
And you can't say stuff
like that

38:05.016 --> 38:07.185
if you offered
to do that, and I still--

38:07.218 --> 38:08.454
- It's not about the money,
that's fine.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.821
- Okay, and I know that--

38:09.855 --> 38:10.922
- It's about thinking
in your head, you know what?

38:10.956 --> 38:12.057
He did A, B, and C for me...

38:12.090 --> 38:13.158
- Okay.
- I'd just like you to go once

38:13.191 --> 38:14.493
in a while and be like
"You know what?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.428
"I'm at the grocery store,
he does like a sandwich,

38:16.462 --> 38:17.696
I'm gonna make sure
I have it for him."

38:17.729 --> 38:19.831
- And do I not do that for you
every single time?

38:19.865 --> 38:21.232
- No, not every single time.
- Okay.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.735
- Sometimes when I ask for it,
it's not there.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.704
- He knows that I
do everything for him.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.539
I do all the laundry, you know,

38:27.573 --> 38:29.040
I clean the house,
I take care of him

38:29.074 --> 38:30.909
and I wait on him
basically hand and foot.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.244
I appreciate everything
he does for me,

38:33.278 --> 38:35.481
but doesn't mean
that he can just do

38:35.514 --> 38:37.148
or say whatever to me sometimes.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.717
- Let's just do this instead
of arguing back and forth.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.985
This is going nowhere.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.120
I'm gonna watch myself
and try a lot harder,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.623
and I'm--maybe
that you could just say okay,

38:44.656 --> 38:45.891
I'll try a little bit
harder too, that--

38:45.924 --> 38:47.125
- But I don't--
- I just don't think making

38:47.158 --> 38:48.293
a turkey sandwich

38:48.394 --> 38:51.262
once in a while for me
for lunch is a big deal.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.501
[indistinct chatter]

38:55.534 --> 38:57.235
- Can I have another beer?

38:57.268 --> 38:58.570
- Yeah, you want a beer?

38:58.604 --> 39:00.105
- Finally she convinced me
to meet him.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.106
- Thank you so much.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.875
- Is this, like,
an LA thing?

39:03.909 --> 39:06.144
- Sh--.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.178
- Thank you.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.647
- I got a good one-piece
for the summer.

39:11.316 --> 39:13.485
- I'm appreciating it.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.422
I'm trying not to get a boner
in the hot tub.

39:16.455 --> 39:19.124
- Oh, my God.
[laughter]

39:19.157 --> 39:21.427
Really subtle.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.462
All right, it's really
f---ing hot in here.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.965
- Well, let's just leave Stassi
and Kyle here.

39:26.998 --> 39:27.966
- Bye.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.868
- I hate to say it but maybe

39:29.901 --> 39:33.004
Stassi should ask herself
what would Lala do?

39:33.038 --> 39:36.475
I mean, this guy probably
has some money.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.744
You never know.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.447
- You look very well
put together.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.448
- Thank you.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.782
[laughter]

39:43.815 --> 39:46.952
- Big fan.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.587
*

39:48.620 --> 39:49.888
- Carl, I need a drink.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.523
- What would you like to drink?
- I don't care.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.291
- What would you--
- Why are you up here

39:53.324 --> 39:57.496
cleaning up?
You're like me.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.865
Katie, for real?

39:59.898 --> 40:02.801
Whenever we're partying
we always leave an extra glass

40:02.834 --> 40:06.204
out on the table
for Tequila Katie.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.239
Here she is.

40:08.273 --> 40:11.342
- Why are you slicing it?
Don't do that.

40:11.376 --> 40:14.546
- No, no, no, one,
two, three, stop.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.615
- Dude, Katie.

40:16.648 --> 40:17.649
Hate that sh--.

40:17.683 --> 40:18.817
Like, that was
the one thing I told

40:18.850 --> 40:20.185
Shay if he did that to me
at the wedding

40:20.218 --> 40:21.319
I was getting an annulment.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.121
When Tequila Katie comes out,

40:23.154 --> 40:24.723
Schwartz isn't there
to put her in here place.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.091
I mean, if Schwartz was here,

40:26.124 --> 40:27.459
he would have frosting
in his face, not me,

40:27.493 --> 40:29.761
and I wouldn't have
to deal with it.

40:29.795 --> 40:32.097
I hate girls' trips.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.365
- Can't be doing that!

40:34.399 --> 40:35.366
- Coming up...

40:35.400 --> 40:37.068
- I've never been
more turned off

40:37.102 --> 40:39.104
by a human being in my life.

40:46.077 --> 40:46.444
[light music]

40:48.046 --> 40:50.081
- You look very well
put together.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.216
- Thank you so much.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.785
- Is this, like,
an L.A. thing, like,

40:53.819 --> 40:55.787
you keep your composure?

40:55.821 --> 40:57.388
- Am I keeping my composure?

40:57.422 --> 40:58.957
- Yeah, I'm very impressed.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.859
[laughter]

41:00.892 --> 41:04.530
- I am here with this bougie,
blue-blooded,

41:04.530 --> 41:07.966
hot guy who shares
the fondness for alcohol.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.168
Basically the odds
are in my favor.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.269
- You're single?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.304
- I'm recently single,
like a week.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.407
- Okay.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.749
It's our first weekend
of the summer.

41:23.782 --> 41:24.750
We've been drinking.

41:24.783 --> 41:27.753
[upbeat music]

41:27.786 --> 41:29.087
*

41:29.120 --> 41:31.289
There's, like,
this sexual connection.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.291
She's blonde.
I'm blonde.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.728
I actually, big fan of, like--
I actually, I have no idea.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.630
Stassi?

41:41.967 --> 41:45.236
- Did you just say you have
no idea, it's what, Stassi?

41:45.270 --> 41:47.005
- No, this is what I do
every time

41:47.038 --> 41:48.740
I meet someone that seems cool.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.810
I forget how to spell
their name,

41:51.843 --> 41:53.579
or I forget their name.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.948
- My name is Stassi, yes.

41:56.982 --> 42:00.819
- My pickup lines peak after
maybe five or six drinks.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.421
And then I cross a threshold,
and I never know when it is--

42:03.454 --> 42:06.224
I just go full-blown
across the line.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.727
Never hung out
with someone in a hot tub

42:08.760 --> 42:10.662
with a turtleneck on.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.865
It's like Steve Jobs.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.433
- Did you just insult
my clothes?

42:15.466 --> 42:18.837
Okay, the line
has now been crossed.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.038
I look like Steve Jobs?

42:20.071 --> 42:22.140
- Bought a white turtleneck

42:22.173 --> 42:25.944
and became a female
and became hot.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.479
- So you want a female
in a turtleneck

42:28.513 --> 42:30.015
with Steve Jobs' face?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.049
- That's not--

42:31.082 --> 42:33.484
- And that's
what I look like?

42:33.518 --> 42:35.787
- Steve Jobs is an idol
of mine.

42:35.821 --> 42:37.355
I thought I'd just
throw that out there,

42:37.388 --> 42:39.490
like, compare her to one
of my idols.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.660
- You're such a charmer,
oh, my goodness.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.462
- No, no, so we got off
the wrong foot.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.764
- It was like, you like,

42:45.797 --> 42:47.899
the right foot was good
and then, like, the left foot,

42:47.933 --> 42:49.801
like, just, like fell asleep.

42:49.835 --> 42:50.802
- [laughs]

42:50.836 --> 42:52.503
- I feel like
I should teach you

42:52.537 --> 42:54.072
some lessons on how to make,

42:54.105 --> 42:55.874
like, a girl feel special.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.710
You should probably, number one,
remember girls' names.

42:58.744 --> 43:01.913
When they tell you things
you should listen.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.815
But also, number three:

43:03.849 --> 43:07.152
you should probably not say
that I look like Steve Jobs...

43:07.185 --> 43:08.419
- It could be worse.
It could be worse.

43:08.453 --> 43:09.554
It could be worse.

43:09.655 --> 43:11.022
- In a swimsuit turtleneck.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.693
- The only way
it could be worse

43:14.726 --> 43:17.095
is if you were,
like, a serial killer.

43:17.128 --> 43:18.096
So there's that.

43:18.129 --> 43:19.364
- Oh, jeez.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.871
Shh.

43:25.904 --> 43:27.405
- Rule number four: do not...

43:27.438 --> 43:29.274
- Don't acknowledge the nipple.
- Tell girls that you're excited

43:29.307 --> 43:31.476
about seeing her nipple
when you don't know her name.

43:31.509 --> 43:34.412
- I don't think "Stousy"
is spending the night tonight.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.448
[dramatic music]

43:38.850 --> 43:41.820
[upbeat music]

43:41.853 --> 43:45.590
*

43:45.691 --> 43:47.759
[all cheering]

43:47.793 --> 43:48.927
- Come on!

43:48.960 --> 43:50.395
Finish that.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.363
- Oh, my God.

43:54.532 --> 43:56.034
- Join the party.

43:56.067 --> 43:58.569
- Stassi's, like, pulling
a Marilyn Monroe tonight.

43:58.603 --> 44:01.106
Her bathing suit is just beyond.

44:01.139 --> 44:05.143
*

44:05.176 --> 44:06.511
Oh, I thought
you were him.

44:06.544 --> 44:08.246
[laughter]

44:08.279 --> 44:09.247
- Yes.

44:09.280 --> 44:15.086
*

44:15.120 --> 44:16.454
He's like, "What's your name?

44:16.487 --> 44:19.324
I can't remember your name.
It's Saucy or..."

44:19.357 --> 44:20.826
What a f---ing idiot.

44:20.859 --> 44:24.095
He left being like, "I see
your nipple and I like it."

44:24.129 --> 44:28.033
That doesn't make my vagina
go like, "Oooh."

44:28.066 --> 44:30.001
- Kyle's a really smart guy.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.137
There's a lot of substance
going on, you know.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.739
- There is.
- Above the abs.

44:37.475 --> 44:39.410
- But you don't want to meet
Kyle for the first time drinking

44:39.444 --> 44:41.146
'cause then you might
be like, "Whoa.

44:41.179 --> 44:45.050
That guy is a frat boy
gone wrong."

44:45.083 --> 44:47.886
- He's genuinely just an idiot
when he's drunk.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.320
But it's not in an offensive way

44:49.354 --> 44:50.756
where I want to, like,
pound him down.

44:50.789 --> 44:53.091
- Well, I mean, I hope you
wouldn't pound anyone down.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.359
I'm like, "Okay."

44:54.392 --> 44:59.097
*

44:59.130 --> 45:00.766
I was just like, "Oh, my God.

45:00.799 --> 45:03.201
This is how people act?"

45:03.234 --> 45:05.470
- No!
- No!

45:05.503 --> 45:07.205
- Oh, yeah.
- Kyle!

45:07.238 --> 45:09.140
*

45:09.174 --> 45:10.641
- How does that work?

45:10.675 --> 45:12.277
- Wait, does that mean you're
a certified, like, genius

45:12.310 --> 45:14.412
and you work at Apple?
- I should f---in' hope so.

45:14.445 --> 45:17.482
- I figured it out.
Your turtleneck!

45:17.515 --> 45:24.489
*

45:24.522 --> 45:26.491
- Kyle?
- What?

45:26.524 --> 45:27.492
- Can I ask you a question?

45:27.525 --> 45:29.828
What did you say
that upset Stassi?

45:29.861 --> 45:31.797
- She had a very nice-looking,
like--

45:31.797 --> 45:33.031
- Yeah.
- White--first of all, she--

45:33.064 --> 45:35.266
Steve Jobs wore black,
so that's my bad.

45:35.300 --> 45:37.803
[laughter]
She had--

45:37.803 --> 45:40.338
No offense, like,
you have a bathing suit

45:40.371 --> 45:41.506
up your f---ing neck.

45:41.539 --> 45:42.707
What the f---?

45:44.542 --> 45:46.477
- I'm gonna go change.
- Okay.

45:46.511 --> 45:48.046
[door slams]

45:48.079 --> 45:51.082
- Kyle, when he's drunk,
does these slow body motions

45:51.116 --> 45:52.650
and a lot of points.

45:52.683 --> 45:55.086
"Hey."

45:55.120 --> 45:58.890
It's like a Ken doll doing
Tai chi underwater.

45:58.924 --> 46:00.525
- I hope, you guys,
she's not mad at me.

46:00.558 --> 46:03.394
- Okay, pretty sure
she's mad at you.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.196
- I love your friend so much.

46:05.230 --> 46:06.697
- It's no big deal, guys,
all right?

46:06.731 --> 46:08.666
- Thank you for coming.
I've had such a good time.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.435
[overlapping speech]
- I'm making up for, uh,

46:10.468 --> 46:13.004
for overstepping on my--
my fashion comments.

46:13.038 --> 46:14.105
I'm sorry.

46:14.139 --> 46:15.373
- Oh, my God, wait, no.

46:15.406 --> 46:18.343
That was--that was
so not the point at all.

46:18.376 --> 46:19.710
You just, like, don't understand
that you're, like,

46:19.744 --> 46:21.913
kind of douchey with, like,
everything else that you do.

46:21.947 --> 46:23.849
- Whoa!

46:23.882 --> 46:25.917
All right.
- So the next time that you

46:25.951 --> 46:28.854
think a girl is, like,
kind of pretty or cool,

46:28.887 --> 46:30.488
you should probably
remember her name,

46:30.521 --> 46:31.923
especially when you've had,
like, a conversation

46:31.957 --> 46:34.860
for, like, 45 minutes.
- Oh, boy.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.727
What's my name?

46:42.633 --> 46:45.370
- Stassi...

46:45.403 --> 46:47.172
- [laughing]

46:47.205 --> 46:48.539
- So in conclusion,

46:48.573 --> 46:49.941
I hope you boys
loved Montauk.

46:49.975 --> 46:52.010
- Seriously, we've had
such a good time.

46:52.043 --> 46:53.144
- That's all for now.

46:53.178 --> 46:55.213
- Move your asses.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.547
- Look, I completely
struck out.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.049
And I learned something
about myself.

46:58.083 --> 46:59.885
After 12 glasses of rosé,

46:59.918 --> 47:02.253
I should probably just
shut the f--- up.

47:02.287 --> 47:05.891
- * We dance to lose
our minds *

47:05.891 --> 47:09.360
* We came to party
and to have a good time *

47:09.394 --> 47:16.434
*

47:16.467 --> 47:19.437
[light music]

47:19.470 --> 47:26.477
*

47:40.591 --> 47:42.260
- Monday is gonna be rough.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.500
- [sighing]

47:54.805 --> 47:56.674
- Oh, f---.

47:56.707 --> 47:59.544
It's so late.
Wake up.

47:59.577 --> 48:01.712
We got to get back
to the city.

48:01.746 --> 48:03.381
You go deep
on Sunday Funday...

48:03.414 --> 48:05.050
Wake up, kids.
You slept in.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.584
You're completely f---ed
on Monday.

48:06.584 --> 48:07.785
And then you're just, like,
trying to, like,

48:07.785 --> 48:09.087
survive the rest of the week.

48:09.087 --> 48:10.321
- I think I'm still drunk.

48:10.321 --> 48:11.722
- I got to leave in,
like, two minutes.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.091
Who's ever coming with me,
you got to go.

48:13.091 --> 48:14.993
- How'd we do that, Everett?

48:14.993 --> 48:16.794
- Leaving Montauk and going
back to New York City,

48:16.794 --> 48:19.664
it's at least a three
and a half hour drive.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.766
Unlike those L.A. chicks,
we have real jobs.

48:21.766 --> 48:23.034
I've got to go make money.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.970
I got to pay for what I just did
this past weekend.

48:28.106 --> 48:31.109
[energetic music]

48:31.109 --> 48:34.279

48:34.279 --> 48:36.347
[car horns honking]

48:36.347 --> 48:38.516
*

48:38.516 --> 48:40.085
- Do me a favor and pull up
that status report

48:40.085 --> 48:41.286
from last month.

48:41.286 --> 48:42.420
- I have the story due
by tomorrow morning.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.421
I'll look at the numbers

48:43.421 --> 48:44.589
and just kind of see any other

48:44.589 --> 48:45.823
deals that we've got
hanging out there.

48:45.823 --> 48:48.493
Monday through Friday,
we work our asses off.

48:48.493 --> 48:50.261
- My recommendation is

48:50.261 --> 48:51.997
really capitalizing now.

48:51.997 --> 48:54.865
- It's challenging, 'cause I
want to have fun,

48:54.865 --> 48:56.467
but I'm almost 34.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.003
Let me schedule that call
with you via email.

48:58.003 --> 48:59.270
- Half my social media feed

48:59.270 --> 49:01.206
is Coachella, Burning Man,

49:01.206 --> 49:03.241
and then the other half
is baby after baby,

49:03.241 --> 49:05.510
wedding after wedding, and I'm
somewhere in between.

49:05.510 --> 49:06.744
- Is it Friday yet?

49:07.812 --> 49:09.014
I'll call you after my meeting.

49:09.014 --> 49:10.048
- All right.
Love you.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.082
- We grind it out,

49:11.082 --> 49:12.083
and like, come summer,

49:12.083 --> 49:13.584
it's hot, it's smelly.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.853
- You'll be sweating from every
crevice of your body.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.122
Hell on Earth.

49:17.122 --> 49:18.756
- You're just like,
"Get me out of here."

49:18.789 --> 49:21.026
- We definitely live
for the weekend.

49:21.026 --> 49:22.660
- We do.
- [laughing]

49:22.693 --> 49:26.164
- * We never stop

49:26.197 --> 49:28.033
* Living the fast life

49:28.033 --> 49:30.835
* From sunset to sunrise

49:30.868 --> 49:34.939
* At night
my love is taking over *

49:35.040 --> 49:36.774
* I know of a place, now

49:36.807 --> 49:38.643
* I'll show you the way

49:38.676 --> 49:41.646

[upbeat pop music]

49:52.057 --> 49:58.696
*

49:58.729 --> 50:00.198
- So glad we're finally here.

50:00.231 --> 50:02.767
*

50:02.800 --> 50:06.104
- Ugh, feels so good
to be standing.

50:06.137 --> 50:07.338
- The first thing I'm doing
is plugging

50:07.372 --> 50:08.773
this margarita machine in.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.708
- But not without helping
unload groceries, Kyle.

50:10.741 --> 50:12.810
- My group of friends--
we've been renting out

50:12.843 --> 50:15.280
in Montauk for years.

50:15.313 --> 50:17.248
This town is just chill.

50:17.282 --> 50:20.685
The Hamptons--that's like your
mom's friend who wears pearls.

50:20.718 --> 50:23.188
East End is more, like,
the cool surfer chick

50:23.221 --> 50:24.622
that is a little promiscuous.

50:24.655 --> 50:25.856
And by a little,
I mean a lot.

50:25.890 --> 50:28.159
- Let's get all the groceries
in the refrigerator.

50:28.193 --> 50:29.994
- We crushed the bread.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.430
- You bought Wonderbread.

50:32.463 --> 50:33.998
There's a reason it's crushed.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.900
- Look at this thing.
- What?

50:35.933 --> 50:37.135
- It's pretty legit.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.636
- How loud is that gonna be?

50:38.669 --> 50:40.071
- What, do you sleep
in the kitchen?

50:40.105 --> 50:41.372
Come on.

50:41.406 --> 50:42.573
- This thing looks sick.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.509
- By the way, kind of awkward

50:44.542 --> 50:46.244
when we decided that
the three of us

50:46.277 --> 50:47.745
were gonna drive together.

50:47.778 --> 50:49.814
So I said, "Oh, shoot.

50:49.847 --> 50:51.149
"Lauren's got to go with Carl,

50:51.182 --> 50:52.583
because she has to go
to work today."

50:52.617 --> 50:55.953
So she was like, "Wait, you guys
are leaving me with Carl alone?"

50:55.986 --> 50:57.255
- What's wrong with that?

50:57.288 --> 50:59.457
- I think last weekend, he was
kind of feeling Lauren.

50:59.490 --> 51:02.460
[upbeat music]

51:02.493 --> 51:07.765
*

51:07.798 --> 51:08.899
- I was.

51:08.933 --> 51:09.900
- I think it's kind of fun
to mix it up.

51:09.934 --> 51:10.901
Like, I've always
been doing this.

51:10.935 --> 51:12.203
This is my sixth summer.
- Love it.

51:12.237 --> 51:13.571
- It's like adult summer camp.
- Really is.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.973
- It's definitely a bonus
when you find out that

51:16.006 --> 51:17.242
the new guy in your summer house

51:17.275 --> 51:18.943
is not only a total babe,

51:18.976 --> 51:20.211
but single.

51:20.245 --> 51:21.579
One year I was
at a summer house,

51:21.612 --> 51:23.948
and by the end of the weekend,
not one toilet worked.

51:23.981 --> 51:25.550
We had two parties,
and so--

51:25.583 --> 51:27.352
- What, I mean--
- We would, like, have to, like,

51:27.385 --> 51:28.753
lock the doors so that
people wouldn't go in,

51:28.786 --> 51:30.355
because they would just go
on top of what was already

51:30.388 --> 51:31.522
in the toilet.

51:31.556 --> 51:33.624
It was so bad.
- That's disgusting.

51:33.658 --> 51:36.461
- Let's just say we probably
didn't get our deposit back.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.429
Are you comfortable being
the new guy in the house?

51:38.463 --> 51:40.331
- Yeah, I mean, I knew Kyle
and Everett a little bit,

51:40.365 --> 51:42.733
but seems like a clique-y
kind of crew, so...

51:42.767 --> 51:44.169
- What?
- Yeah.

51:44.169 --> 51:45.703
- No.
- What do you mean?

51:45.736 --> 51:46.904
You guys have known
each other for--

51:46.937 --> 51:48.173
- Well, clique-y 'cause
we know each other.

51:48.173 --> 51:49.307
But not clique-y that we're not,
like--

51:49.340 --> 51:51.542
we're so inclusive of anyone
and everyone.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.811
- I'm just worried that I'm not
gonna be on the inside jokes.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.446
- You are gonna be in
on the inside jokes.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.614
We're gonna make new ones.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.383
- The group is
really, really tight.

51:58.416 --> 51:59.950
They've all been
friends for years.

51:59.984 --> 52:01.186
They've done summer houses.

52:01.186 --> 52:02.653
I love being the new guy.

52:02.687 --> 52:03.821
You're a little bit
of a wild card.

52:03.854 --> 52:05.490
- What's your best pickup line?

52:05.523 --> 52:07.425
How does Carl Radke get girls?

52:07.458 --> 52:09.194
- Very simple.

52:09.194 --> 52:11.696
- What?
- Hi, my name's Carl.

52:11.729 --> 52:12.763
- Hi.
- What's your name?

52:12.797 --> 52:13.798
- Lauren.
Nice to meet you.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.366
- Pleasure's all mine.

52:15.400 --> 52:18.369
[laid-back music]

52:18.403 --> 52:20.671
*

52:20.705 --> 52:22.240
- Don't you guys think
he's a player?

52:22.273 --> 52:23.474
- Yeah, totally a player.

52:23.508 --> 52:25.410
- Lauren can't go for
these types of guys.

52:25.443 --> 52:28.045
- There's a lot of guys that
pride themselves in New York

52:28.078 --> 52:30.748
about, like, just juggling,
like, two, three,

52:30.781 --> 52:32.383
five or six girls.

52:32.417 --> 52:33.418
- Oh, boy.

52:33.451 --> 52:34.852
- And that's Carl to a T.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.221
- You got the bags.

52:36.221 --> 52:37.355
- That's just not me.

52:37.388 --> 52:38.589
I'd feel like a dick,

52:38.623 --> 52:40.658
and there is some
f---ing guilty conscience

52:40.691 --> 52:42.927
upstairs in this blonde flow.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.730
Hey, Kyle.
- Hi.

52:45.763 --> 52:47.432
- How are you?
- How you doing?

52:47.465 --> 52:48.933
- Dude, it's been a battle.

52:48.966 --> 52:50.735
- Yeah, check out my
margarita machine.

52:50.768 --> 52:51.969
[overlapping speech]

52:52.002 --> 52:53.238
Oh, my God.

52:53.238 --> 52:54.239
- I grew up in Pittsburgh,

52:54.239 --> 52:55.806
which is a very
blue-collar city.

52:55.840 --> 52:56.907
My mom would work a whole year

52:56.941 --> 52:58.309
to be able to go on vacation.

52:58.343 --> 53:01.446
I had six days on the beach
for one year.

53:01.479 --> 53:03.848
So the beach, to me,
was like this fantasy land.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.717
That's why you work your ass off
to go and enjoy these things.

53:06.751 --> 53:08.819
- Can we get the rundown of what
we're having for dinner?

53:08.853 --> 53:12.357
- We will try some highly...

53:12.390 --> 53:14.024
questionable margaritas.

53:14.058 --> 53:16.427
- Yeah, looks like
a dishwashing liquid.

53:16.461 --> 53:18.863
- It's Slimer green margaritas.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.164
- I'm so glad you guys are here.

53:20.265 --> 53:21.732
Hey, I'm gonna go unpack.
Did you get--

53:21.766 --> 53:23.268
- No, I'm unpacking.
The hangers came.

53:23.268 --> 53:25.503
- We're gonna go unpack.

53:25.536 --> 53:26.737
- Hey, I'm gonna
shut the door.

53:26.771 --> 53:29.640
- We got all the hangers.
- I want to unpack.

53:29.674 --> 53:32.076
We're identical twins,
but we're not exactly alike.

53:32.109 --> 53:34.279
- Married twin.
- Single twin.

53:34.279 --> 53:35.580
And I have the better boobs.

53:35.613 --> 53:36.647
- I beg to differ.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.383
Your boobs hang a little
lower than mine.

53:38.416 --> 53:39.384
- How do you--
- Sorry.

53:39.417 --> 53:40.518
First of all, how do you--
- Sorry.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.052
- First of all,
how do you know that?

53:42.086 --> 53:43.654
- 'Cause I've seen you naked.
- And I've seen you.

53:43.688 --> 53:44.922
- Yours might be
a little bigger.

53:44.955 --> 53:46.624
- I'm a 32 G.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.025
- Well, she's only that large--
- G as in giraffe.

53:50.295 --> 53:51.696
- I'm really unmotivated
to unpack.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.564
I think I brought my
whole wardrobe here.

53:53.598 --> 53:55.933
- [laughs] So how was
the car ride out?

53:55.966 --> 53:57.702
- Great. Tell me,
how was your car ride out?

53:57.735 --> 53:58.869
- Oh, my God,
it was fun.

53:58.903 --> 54:00.838
[laughs]
- What do you think about Carl?

54:00.871 --> 54:02.440
- Carl's fun.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.108
I didn't get to spend a lot
of time with him last weekend.

54:04.141 --> 54:05.376
So, like, it was fun.

54:05.410 --> 54:06.777
- Is there, like, chemistry?

54:06.811 --> 54:09.380
[light music]

54:09.414 --> 54:11.015
- I mean, yeah, I think
he's good-looking.

54:11.048 --> 54:12.350
Like, I don't know him
well enough yet.

54:12.383 --> 54:13.684
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I just met the guy.

54:13.718 --> 54:16.787
- Lauren has had very
bad luck with guys.

54:16.821 --> 54:18.856
- Trust me, she's not envious
of my situation.

54:18.889 --> 54:21.692
- I met my husband Brad
my first week of college.

54:21.726 --> 54:24.028
After we got married, he took
a job in California,

54:24.061 --> 54:25.730
and I'll be moving home
at the end of the summer.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.332
- The words I don't
want to hear.

54:27.332 --> 54:29.400
- I just really want Lauren
to have what I have.

54:29.434 --> 54:31.336
And the clock is
definitely ticking.

54:31.336 --> 54:33.771
My only thing was then--
the vibe I got was,

54:33.804 --> 54:35.139
like, is he, like, a player?

54:35.172 --> 54:39.510
*

54:39.544 --> 54:40.511
- I don't know yet.

54:40.545 --> 54:41.946
I haven't gotten
a feel for that.

54:41.979 --> 54:43.113
I think I'm pretty good at
judging that, and, like--

54:43.147 --> 54:44.114
- You don't have
that feeling yet?

54:44.148 --> 54:45.450
Why do I have that feeling?

54:45.483 --> 54:46.484
- No, I obviously feel like--
he's only lived

54:46.517 --> 54:47.885
in New York for two years.

54:47.918 --> 54:48.986
When someone's not lived
in New York for very long--

54:49.019 --> 54:50.588
- Right, it's like
just the most amazing--

54:50.621 --> 54:51.922
- It's like a free-for-all.
It's like Disneyland for guys.

54:51.956 --> 54:52.990
Like, think about it.

54:53.023 --> 54:54.191
Take a new ride
every single night.

54:54.224 --> 54:56.494
I can see myself
liking this person,

54:56.527 --> 54:57.962
but it's just the beginning
of the summer.

54:57.995 --> 54:59.530
I'm getting to know him,
and the only way

54:59.564 --> 55:02.066
to get to know someone and see
if what you're feeling is true

55:02.099 --> 55:03.368
is to spend time with them.

55:03.368 --> 55:04.535
- I just hope it
doesn't end up

55:04.569 --> 55:06.571
that you put all your
eggs in one basket,

55:06.604 --> 55:08.238
and it blows up in your face.

55:08.272 --> 55:11.376
I want you to, like,
really, consciously, like

55:11.376 --> 55:12.443
think about this.

55:12.477 --> 55:13.478
- You need to be my
second set of eyes.

55:13.511 --> 55:14.945
- Okay, but don't
get to the point

55:14.979 --> 55:16.046
where you're annoyed

55:16.080 --> 55:18.082
because it's not what
you thought it was.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.054
- I'm around you all the time.

55:24.088 --> 55:25.756
You talk about your
boyfriend all the time.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.592
- You're jealous,
you're not happy,

55:27.625 --> 55:29.994
and you're bitter.

55:31.396 --> 55:33.063
- If that mother----er Carl

55:33.097 --> 55:36.401
breaks her heart, he better
run and hide,

55:41.271 --> 55:41.639
[smooth music]

55:44.241 --> 55:48.413

55:48.446 --> 55:52.049
- * Hey hey, hey hey,
hey hey *

55:52.082 --> 55:53.451
- Hello.

55:53.484 --> 55:55.420
- Hello?
- Who that?

55:55.420 --> 55:57.154
- Hi.
- Come in.

55:57.187 --> 55:59.223
- Is that the world's
happiest couple?

55:59.256 --> 56:01.426
- Smells good.

56:01.459 --> 56:02.593
Smells very good.

56:02.627 --> 56:04.929
- What up, buddy?

56:04.962 --> 56:06.063
[clapping]

56:06.096 --> 56:07.264
- It smells so good.

56:07.297 --> 56:08.899
- Well, we just burned
the sh-- out of--

56:08.933 --> 56:10.300
- Dude, we made it in, like,
world-record time.

56:10.334 --> 56:11.669
We beat the train by,
like, an hour and a half.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.003
- Oh, perfect.
What's happening?

56:13.037 --> 56:14.439
How are you?
- Good. Hi.

56:14.439 --> 56:16.040
- Wirkus-circus, what's up?

56:16.073 --> 56:19.677
- Happy weekend.
Happy America's birthday.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.045
- Favorite weekend of the year.

56:21.078 --> 56:23.714
- When we rented the house
in February, I was single.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.149
Hi.
- Hi.

56:25.182 --> 56:27.317
- Obviously, things
have changed.

56:27.351 --> 56:28.553
Everett and I have been friends

56:28.586 --> 56:30.054
with this group for
over two years,

56:30.087 --> 56:32.457
but we only starting dating
two months ago.

56:32.457 --> 56:34.091
- Dude, why don't you put
your shoes in the closet?

56:34.124 --> 56:35.993
Where are you putting them?

56:36.026 --> 56:37.294
- Everett's a sexy man.

56:37.327 --> 56:38.596
- Lindsay and I are a team.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.465
We're like the clownfish
and the sea anemone.

56:40.465 --> 56:42.199
I mean, it's a great
symbiotic relationship.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.201
- It's disgusting,
quite frankly.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.870
I was with her on Monday,

56:45.903 --> 56:48.506
and she was talking
about getting married.

56:48.539 --> 56:50.875
- She told me the same thing.
- It's crazy.

56:50.908 --> 56:52.510
- Hey, time out.
Time the f--- out.

56:52.543 --> 56:53.611
What do you--what do you mean?

56:53.644 --> 56:55.513
- He's saving his money
for a ring.

56:55.546 --> 56:58.983
- I know firsthand that Everett
is the ultimate single guy

56:59.016 --> 57:00.017
to have around.

57:00.050 --> 57:01.586
That's what I thought

57:01.619 --> 57:02.853
I was gonna get.

57:02.887 --> 57:04.822
- Since when did this
get so serious?

57:04.855 --> 57:06.524
They're acting like they're
a married couple.

57:06.557 --> 57:08.493
- Lindsay and I were hanging out
all the time

57:08.526 --> 57:10.327
when she invited me
to join the house.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.896
But now she and Everett
are dating,

57:11.929 --> 57:14.832
and I'm stuck spending my summer
with the Malibu Barbie twins

57:14.865 --> 57:16.667
and their drunk cousin Kyle.

57:16.701 --> 57:18.503
- The problem that I noticed
about Lindsay is,

57:18.503 --> 57:20.404
like, she goes in hard, right?

57:20.505 --> 57:22.740
Like, she meets a guy,
and that moves too fast.

57:22.773 --> 57:25.610
And for me, I just get scared,
like, what will happen

57:25.643 --> 57:27.512
if this doesn't end well.

57:29.246 --> 57:31.315
- Who that?
- Hey.

57:31.348 --> 57:32.817
- Cristina!

57:32.850 --> 57:35.185
- Happy Friday.
Happy 4th of July weekend.

57:35.219 --> 57:37.387
Montauk is the place to be
on the 4th of July.

57:37.421 --> 57:38.656
- Where are you coming from?

57:38.689 --> 57:40.525
- I've been out here
since yesterday.

57:40.525 --> 57:44.695
I've done houses with
Lindsay, Kyle, the twins...

57:44.729 --> 57:46.631
I've not done a house
with Everett,

57:46.664 --> 57:47.798
Carl, or Stephen.

57:47.832 --> 57:48.999
The house that Kyle
put together

57:49.033 --> 57:51.869
is a perfect storm
of big personalities

57:51.902 --> 57:53.771
and crazy people.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.774
[upbeat music]

57:56.807 --> 58:00.778
*

58:00.811 --> 58:02.379
- This looks amazing.
I'm starving.

58:02.412 --> 58:03.614
- What a treat.

58:03.648 --> 58:04.782
We roll up and have
dinner ready.

58:04.815 --> 58:06.450
- If anyone doesn't know,

58:06.551 --> 58:08.285
I got a tick last week

58:08.318 --> 58:09.654
from this house.

58:09.687 --> 58:12.089
- [gasps]
- She sent me a tick pic.

58:12.122 --> 58:14.925
[laughter]

58:14.959 --> 58:16.927
- Oh, my God.

58:16.961 --> 58:18.028
- Where was it?

58:18.062 --> 58:19.697
- Creeping up towards
the groin area.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.666
- They like dark spots. [laughs]

58:21.699 --> 58:23.000
Lauren's a hot chick.

58:23.033 --> 58:25.603
If I was a tick, I would
definitely crawl all over that.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.572
But it would take a long time
to get up from the ankle

58:27.572 --> 58:29.306
to up to the--
you know, the fun part.

58:29.339 --> 58:32.209
- Everybody got enough
salad, steak?

58:32.242 --> 58:33.210
- Kyle, we're good.

58:33.243 --> 58:34.779
- Once I sit, I'm off duty.

58:34.812 --> 58:38.048
I basically met everyone in
the house through Montauk.

58:38.082 --> 58:41.118
I met Lauren on a train
Memorial Day Weekend 2014.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.186
Through Lauren,
I met her sister.

58:42.219 --> 58:43.821
- Oh, my God.

58:43.854 --> 58:45.189
- That same train I was on
with Cristina,

58:45.222 --> 58:46.724
who was in my house that year.

58:46.757 --> 58:49.459
I met Lindsay 'cause she
was Cristina's guest.

58:49.493 --> 58:51.128
I met Stephen through Lindsay.

58:51.161 --> 58:53.764
Everett I met July 4th 2014.

58:53.798 --> 58:55.132
He was having a house party.

58:55.165 --> 58:57.001
I met Carl last year.

58:57.034 --> 59:00.037
He was literally chugging the
world's largest bottle of rosé.

59:00.070 --> 59:02.072
It was the size of
a seven-year-old child.

59:02.106 --> 59:04.308
A lot of these people
that you grow close with

59:04.341 --> 59:05.943
over the summer become
your closest friends.

59:05.976 --> 59:09.079
God forbid one of us got an STD,
because, you know,

59:09.113 --> 59:10.815
in a matter of weeks,
we'd all be infected.

59:10.848 --> 59:12.650
- You guys, that was a really
good dinner. Thanks.

59:12.683 --> 59:14.418
- We shopped it.
We cooked it.

59:14.451 --> 59:16.286
Now you all get to clean it.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.321
[overlapping speech

59:17.354 --> 59:19.356
- You want cleanup.
Yeah.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.725
- Cleanup.

59:20.758 --> 59:23.060
- [laughing]

59:23.093 --> 59:26.063
[energetic music]

59:26.096 --> 59:27.397
- Does anyone want
to save salad?

59:27.431 --> 59:28.532
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:28.633 --> 59:30.835
- That's f---ing great salad.

59:30.868 --> 59:32.002
- I'll clean the counter.

59:32.036 --> 59:33.871
*

59:33.904 --> 59:37.374
- * Hey, live your life

59:37.407 --> 59:39.644
* And join me on
the dark side *

59:39.677 --> 59:40.678
[thunder cracking]

59:40.711 --> 59:41.679
- Does anyone need
any more rosé?

59:41.712 --> 59:43.013
I want to get, like, cozy.

59:43.047 --> 59:45.015
- Carl, light some candles.
Let's get cozy.

59:45.049 --> 59:46.984
- I know, it is a little
rainy night in Montauk.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.518
- One of the first times
Everett and I met--

59:48.552 --> 59:50.220
- I mean--
- Remember that 4th of July?

59:50.254 --> 59:51.421
The torrential downpour?

59:51.455 --> 59:54.324
And we were at your house,
and the cops came.

59:54.358 --> 59:55.325
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay,

59:55.359 --> 59:56.661
what are our summer goals,
you guys?

59:56.694 --> 59:57.995
- Yeah, social goals.

59:58.028 --> 1:00:00.130
- My social goal--
I want to do something

1:00:00.164 --> 1:00:01.932
that I don't normally do
when I come out here,

1:00:01.966 --> 1:00:03.133
whether that be like going--

1:00:03.167 --> 1:00:04.168
- [speaks indistinctly]

1:00:04.201 --> 1:00:06.403
[laughter]

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:08.105
- Everett, get your mind
out of the gutter.

1:00:08.138 --> 1:00:09.473
- Your summer goal
is clearly--

1:00:09.506 --> 1:00:10.574
- How do you know what
my summer goal is?

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.276
- Clearly to find a guy.

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:13.644
- No, that is the Ashley--

1:00:13.678 --> 1:00:15.813
- I actually--guess what.
I know what my summer goals are.

1:00:15.846 --> 1:00:19.817
My summer goals are to help
Lauren find a man.

1:00:19.850 --> 1:00:21.752
[playful music]

1:00:21.786 --> 1:00:25.422
- My goal is to wingman
this guy.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:29.660
We totally had a, like,
bro-mance last summer.

1:00:29.694 --> 1:00:32.529
And I would love to support him
in his efforts.

1:00:32.562 --> 1:00:35.265
- I think only, like,
first- and second-graders

1:00:35.299 --> 1:00:36.633
have summer goals.

1:00:36.667 --> 1:00:38.135
It's usually something like,

1:00:38.168 --> 1:00:39.870
"I want to learn how
to braid hair."

1:00:39.904 --> 1:00:41.672
So stupid.

1:00:41.706 --> 1:00:43.173
No.

1:00:43.207 --> 1:00:45.042
- All right, you want to talk
about my social goals?

1:00:45.075 --> 1:00:47.978
I do kind of get caught up
in the bro-y moment,

1:00:48.012 --> 1:00:49.246
just having fun.

1:00:49.279 --> 1:00:50.881
- Shocking.
- Making friends.

1:00:50.915 --> 1:00:52.216
- It's called a bro-ment.

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:54.584
- I just don't want to be
bro-menting into my 40s.

1:00:54.618 --> 1:00:56.320
[laughter]

1:00:56.353 --> 1:00:57.888
I was born in 1982.

1:00:57.922 --> 1:01:00.758
I'm literally the oldest
millennial in the Hamptons.

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:03.560
And I realize that
dancing on the bar

1:01:03.728 --> 1:01:05.395
and staying up till
4:00 in the morning

1:01:05.429 --> 1:01:07.297
isn't as cute as it once was.

1:01:07.331 --> 1:01:08.933
And I need to grow up.

1:01:08.966 --> 1:01:12.036
I think we should maybe end
the night with beer pong.

1:01:12.069 --> 1:01:13.403
- I'm going to bed.

1:01:13.437 --> 1:01:14.504
- Who's playing beer pong?

1:01:14.538 --> 1:01:17.507
[energetic music]

1:01:17.541 --> 1:01:24.381

1:01:24.414 --> 1:01:25.883

- Okay, bye.

1:01:38.362 --> 1:01:42.432

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:44.835
- This is what we do
every single weekend.

1:01:44.869 --> 1:01:46.636
It is a Montauk marathon.

1:01:46.670 --> 1:01:48.205
Beach parties, pool parties,

1:01:48.238 --> 1:01:49.373
boozy brunches,

1:01:49.406 --> 1:01:50.607
and then we go out at night.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:51.876
- Guys.
- Yeah!

1:01:51.909 --> 1:01:53.543
Five seconds--go.

1:01:53.577 --> 1:01:55.445
And every bar is open
till 4:00 a.m.

1:01:55.479 --> 1:01:57.247
F---ing love this town.

1:01:57.281 --> 1:01:58.883
Where the f--- is Carl?

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.484
- Where's Carl?
- Where's Carl?

1:02:00.517 --> 1:02:01.651
- Where is Carl?

1:02:25.609 --> 1:02:28.612

1:02:28.645 --> 1:02:31.615
- You know, you make me feel
so good about myself.

1:02:31.648 --> 1:02:33.150
- Relax.

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:46.730
[door slams]

1:02:47.832 --> 1:02:48.999
- We need our beauty sleep.

1:02:49.033 --> 1:02:51.668
- We definitely need at least
seven to eight hours.

1:02:51.701 --> 1:02:53.337
- I prefer eight.

1:02:53.370 --> 1:03:01.078
*

1:03:01.111 --> 1:03:02.512
- I'm going.

1:03:02.546 --> 1:03:09.553
*

1:03:13.590 --> 1:03:15.025
- Amanda's my ex-girlfriend.

1:03:15.025 --> 1:03:16.526
We were dating earlier
in the year,

1:03:16.526 --> 1:03:18.528
and the moment I realized
there was gonna be Montauk,

1:03:18.528 --> 1:03:20.330
I had to break things off.

1:03:20.330 --> 1:03:23.467
You do not want to be cuffed
during the summer.

1:03:27.571 --> 1:03:30.574
- [moaning]

1:03:35.645 --> 1:03:37.081

1:03:37.114 --> 1:03:43.888

1:03:43.921 --> 1:03:45.755

talking about being together

1:03:45.789 --> 1:03:47.224
since we met.

1:03:47.257 --> 1:03:48.993
- I feel like your first date
was, like, two months ago.

1:03:49.026 --> 1:03:51.061
- Do you need, like,
a cotton swab for your ears?

1:03:51.095 --> 1:03:52.562
- [imitates brakes screeching]

[relaxed music]

1:04:02.206 --> 1:04:09.279
*

1:04:12.449 --> 1:04:14.618
- Living in a co-ed
summer house, it's--

1:04:14.651 --> 1:04:17.988
there's a lot of politics
that go into hooking up.

1:04:18.022 --> 1:04:20.490
Last summer, I didn't
sleep in my house once.

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:21.926
*

1:04:21.926 --> 1:04:23.827
The one time I tried
to bring girls back,

1:04:23.928 --> 1:04:25.795
I was actually denied
at the door

1:04:25.829 --> 1:04:27.932
for no other reason than
the one girl in the house

1:04:27.932 --> 1:04:29.433
was kind of interested in me

1:04:29.466 --> 1:04:30.834
and got a little jealous.

* So we blowing up big

- Hello.

1:04:53.623 --> 1:04:55.225
- Do you have my sunscreen,
by any chance?

1:04:55.259 --> 1:04:57.027
- No, I don't know
where it went.

1:04:57.061 --> 1:04:58.828
- I just gave it
to you upstairs.

1:04:58.862 --> 1:05:00.998
- Uh...
- Memory loss.

1:05:01.031 --> 1:05:02.566
- I think I put it down
somewhere.

1:05:02.599 --> 1:05:05.202
- Kind of would like to use it.

1:05:05.235 --> 1:05:08.205
- Yes, Lindsay just came up
to my room and asked me for it.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:11.475
I have known Lindsay for
seven or eight years.

1:05:11.508 --> 1:05:13.777
We moved in together
two and half years ago.

1:05:13.810 --> 1:05:16.981
- Thank you.

1:05:16.981 --> 1:05:18.515
- Go for it.

1:05:18.548 --> 1:05:20.850
- She can be a little
self-absorbed at times,

1:05:20.884 --> 1:05:23.988
which can be frustrating
when you live with her.

1:05:23.988 --> 1:05:25.755
Can I see the sunscreen?

1:05:25.789 --> 1:05:28.192
- I'm still waiting to use it.

1:05:28.225 --> 1:05:30.227
- I didn't realize--
- 'Cause you took mine.

1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:32.796
- Cristina and I, we've
known each other the longest.

1:05:32.829 --> 1:05:34.264
We lived in L.A. together.

1:05:34.298 --> 1:05:36.000
She's an entertainment reporter.

1:05:36.033 --> 1:05:38.335
Her job is literally to gossip.

1:05:38.368 --> 1:05:41.005
All right, your turn, hubs.

1:05:41.005 --> 1:05:42.772
We struggle in
our relationship.

1:05:42.806 --> 1:05:45.609
We fight.

1:05:45.642 --> 1:05:47.744
Ooh. Ooh, yeah.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:50.047
- Lindsay and Everett
are over the top.

1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:53.483
Their PDA and the fact that now
I live with her during the week,

1:05:53.517 --> 1:05:55.085
her boyfriend sometimes
during the week,

1:05:55.119 --> 1:05:57.454
and now I live with them
on the weekends as well--

1:05:57.487 --> 1:05:59.023
it's just a lot.

1:05:59.023 --> 1:06:01.225
- Oh, hey, Stephen.
Oh!

1:06:01.258 --> 1:06:02.459
all: Whoa.

1:06:02.492 --> 1:06:04.394
- Swan dive.
- Wow, so graceful.

1:06:04.428 --> 1:06:05.629
- Coming in hot.

1:06:05.662 --> 1:06:06.896
- Awesome.
- And the glasses stayed on.

1:06:06.930 --> 1:06:08.198
Impressed.

1:06:08.232 --> 1:06:09.766
- I've been coming out
to Montauk for years,

1:06:09.799 --> 1:06:12.269
but this is my first
full summer in a house.

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:15.572
I love this cold pool.

1:06:15.605 --> 1:06:19.043
I'm in a transcontinental
relationship, which is not easy.

1:06:19.076 --> 1:06:21.745
But it cannot be as hard as
living together all the time,

1:06:21.778 --> 1:06:23.347
like Cristina and Lindsay.

1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:24.714
- Babe, you know Volare, right,

1:06:24.748 --> 1:06:26.116
in Greenwich Village?
- No.

1:06:26.150 --> 1:06:28.052
- Anyway, we had
an award ceremony...

1:06:37.794 --> 1:06:40.764
[upbeat music]

1:06:40.797 --> 1:06:45.935
*

1:06:45.969 --> 1:06:47.104
- You ready, Cris?
- Yep.

1:06:51.275 --> 1:06:52.976
- I wish you got water bottles
for the road.

1:06:53.077 --> 1:06:54.311
I got one.
- Oh.

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.812
- Thank you.

1:06:55.845 --> 1:07:00.484
*

1:07:00.517 --> 1:07:02.686
- So, Linds, you guys
came home pretty late.

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:03.920
- We went to Liars,

1:07:04.088 --> 1:07:05.555
and at some point
I just was so tired,

1:07:05.589 --> 1:07:06.623
I looked at everyone
and I was like,

1:07:06.656 --> 1:07:07.891
"I'm going.
You can stay.

1:07:07.924 --> 1:07:09.526
I don't care, I got to go."
- Yeah, right.

1:07:09.559 --> 1:07:10.860
- Oh, did you leave
by yourself?

1:07:10.894 --> 1:07:12.262
- No, no.
- Everyone came.

1:07:12.296 --> 1:07:15.599
- Except Carl.
Carl's a lone wolf.

1:07:15.632 --> 1:07:17.601
Do you think Lauren
cared at all last night

1:07:17.634 --> 1:07:19.536
that he, like, slept out, or do
you think she just doesn't--

1:07:19.569 --> 1:07:21.605
- No, I don't think so.
I don't think she cares.

1:07:21.638 --> 1:07:23.240
- I'm 32 and single.

1:07:23.273 --> 1:07:25.375
I've been in New York
for six years.

1:07:25.409 --> 1:07:26.843
I've done the dating thing,

1:07:26.876 --> 1:07:29.113
and I think women see
what they want to see

1:07:29.146 --> 1:07:30.580
when it comes to guys
that they like.

1:07:30.614 --> 1:07:32.949
And listen, I've gotten
burned by guys before.

1:07:32.982 --> 1:07:35.018
Okay, yeah, late--
late night.

1:07:35.119 --> 1:07:37.387
Carl's a little too slick
for my tastes.

1:07:37.421 --> 1:07:40.390
[upbeat pop music]

1:07:40.424 --> 1:07:41.891
- It's a very, very good day *

1:07:41.925 --> 1:07:46.130
*

1:07:46.163 --> 1:07:48.365
* Hey, it's a good day

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:50.567
* It's a very, very,
very good day *

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:51.768
- Thank you again.

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:53.703
Thank you for coming.
[car engine roars]

1:07:53.737 --> 1:07:55.405
- Uh, that was a Ferrari.

1:07:55.439 --> 1:07:57.274
- How do--do you know
a Ferrari, what it sounds like?

1:07:57.307 --> 1:07:58.275
- Oh, yeah.
[car engine hums]

1:07:58.308 --> 1:07:59.276
That's a Corvette.

1:07:59.309 --> 1:08:00.810
- [laughing]
- No.

1:08:00.844 --> 1:08:02.712
- So what's the, uh--what's
the game plan for the day?

1:08:02.746 --> 1:08:06.150
- Honestly, I think we just
got a new influx.

1:08:06.150 --> 1:08:07.784
Couple--couple cocktails.

1:08:07.817 --> 1:08:08.918
- Seriously--
- Holy sh--.

1:08:08.952 --> 1:08:10.354
- We'll figure something out.
- Okay.

1:08:10.387 --> 1:08:12.156
There's one game plan.

1:08:12.156 --> 1:08:13.457
- I stare because I care.

1:08:13.490 --> 1:08:16.493
- So last night, it was
kind of good to sneak away.

1:08:16.526 --> 1:08:18.061
- Dude, when we rolled
into Great Lady,

1:08:18.162 --> 1:08:19.496
it was like a homecoming party.

1:08:19.529 --> 1:08:20.697
- Yeah.
- You were there for a bit,

1:08:20.730 --> 1:08:22.566
and then you just ghosted.

1:08:22.599 --> 1:08:25.169
- So I ran into
an old flame.

1:08:25.169 --> 1:08:26.503
I was wearing my
Pittsburgh hat.

1:08:26.536 --> 1:08:29.273
She stole my hat--
classic girl move.

1:08:29.306 --> 1:08:30.740
- Classic girl move.

1:08:30.774 --> 1:08:34.178
- So obviously, I had
to get my hat back.

1:08:34.178 --> 1:08:38.215
- [laughing]

1:08:38.248 --> 1:08:39.816
I want to hear
about your night.

1:08:39.849 --> 1:08:41.685
Kyle legit got a little
frisky last night.

1:08:41.718 --> 1:08:43.353
- I thought we had
a new roommate.

1:08:43.387 --> 1:08:44.754
- First sleepover
of the summer.

1:08:44.788 --> 1:08:47.524
Yeah, no, it was
a good home game.

1:08:47.557 --> 1:08:48.825
- Hey, home game.
- Home game.

1:08:48.858 --> 1:08:50.093
- Home game!

1:08:50.194 --> 1:08:51.828
I'm an away guy, but you're
a home game guy.

1:08:51.861 --> 1:08:53.197
- [laughing]

1:08:53.230 --> 1:08:56.566
- But I'm a little nervous
that hooking up with Amanda

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.768
could turn into, like,
a regular thing,

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:02.272
because I know that's gonna make
it all the much harder for her.

1:09:02.306 --> 1:09:04.341
And meanwhile, I need to be
single this summer.

1:09:04.374 --> 1:09:05.942
- Why can't you guys just
hook up and have fun?

1:09:05.975 --> 1:09:07.110
- 'Cause she's like,
"I can't just be friends.

1:09:07.211 --> 1:09:08.412
"I can't just be hooking up.

1:09:08.445 --> 1:09:09.813
I want to be in
a relationship with you."

1:09:09.846 --> 1:09:11.748
- Right.
- I try to be respectful

1:09:11.781 --> 1:09:12.916
and not reach out to her,

1:09:12.949 --> 1:09:16.085
but last night, we kind of just
hopped into, like,

1:09:16.119 --> 1:09:17.387
our old ways.

1:09:17.421 --> 1:09:18.688
- Yeah, exactly.

1:09:18.722 --> 1:09:20.857
- Which involved getting naked
and jumping in the hot tub.

1:09:20.890 --> 1:09:22.292
- [laughing]

1:09:22.326 --> 1:09:23.593
- [laughing]

1:09:23.627 --> 1:09:24.861
- So what about you, Carl?

1:09:24.894 --> 1:09:26.896
- I confess, when I
lived in L.A.,

1:09:26.930 --> 1:09:29.966
I looked into getting
a skywriter for an engagement.

1:09:29.999 --> 1:09:31.468
I was in a very
serious relationship

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:33.036
for about two and half years.

1:09:33.069 --> 1:09:34.538
There was a lot
of pressure from her.

1:09:34.571 --> 1:09:36.873
She had four sisters
who were all married.

1:09:36.906 --> 1:09:40.244
And she was kind of getting that
biological clock thing going.

1:09:40.244 --> 1:09:41.978
I didn't end up
following through.

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:45.949
Oddly enough, that I broke up
with her on a private plane.

1:09:45.982 --> 1:09:47.251
- And then--

1:09:47.251 --> 1:09:49.253
do you, like, a parachute,
just jumped out?

1:09:49.286 --> 1:09:51.255
[laughing]
- I wish I did.

1:09:51.255 --> 1:09:53.323
Or crashed it.
- Holy sh--.

1:09:53.357 --> 1:09:55.024
That's, like, the most epic
breakup, like--

1:09:55.058 --> 1:09:56.426
- It is, and you know
what everybody says?

1:09:56.460 --> 1:09:58.662
"What's wrong with you, man?
She has a private plane."

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:00.129
I'm like, "Listen,
this is the challenge:

1:10:00.163 --> 1:10:02.832
meeting a girl where you can
take all that stuff away."

1:10:02.866 --> 1:10:04.501
What do we have left?
- Wow.

1:10:04.534 --> 1:10:05.735
- People ask,
"Why'd you break up with her?"

1:10:05.769 --> 1:10:07.103
This is what I said:

1:10:07.136 --> 1:10:08.705
"She couldn't live in
a cardboard box with me."

1:10:08.738 --> 1:10:10.139
But if you guys
want a skywriter,

1:10:10.173 --> 1:10:12.008
I got a guy.
- You got a guy.

1:10:12.041 --> 1:10:14.678
[laughing]

1:10:14.711 --> 1:10:16.145
[light music]

1:10:16.179 --> 1:10:18.415
- You just sit and talk
and talk about yourself.

1:10:18.448 --> 1:10:19.883
- You think that
I'm selfish.

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:23.152
Fine, but if I hear something
else come out of your mouth

1:10:23.186 --> 1:10:24.153
about Everett and I,

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:30.260
[upbeat music]

1:10:31.728 --> 1:10:33.530
- I really need coffee.
- Me, too.

1:10:33.563 --> 1:10:35.164
*

1:10:35.198 --> 1:10:36.700
- Let us know if we can
help you with anything.

1:10:36.733 --> 1:10:39.002
- Thank you.

1:10:39.035 --> 1:10:41.838
- Oh, my God, do you see
the 4th of July stuff, Ashley?

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:44.308
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Does this not fit our house?

1:10:44.341 --> 1:10:45.675
I think all of us need this.

1:10:45.709 --> 1:10:47.076
- What do you guys
think about this?

1:10:47.110 --> 1:10:48.278
- For the 4th, that'll be
really cute.

1:10:48.312 --> 1:10:49.779
- Yeah.

1:10:49.813 --> 1:10:52.716
- Lindsay, I kind of wanted
to talk to you about something.

1:10:52.749 --> 1:10:55.218
I just feel like there's
a little bit of tension

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:56.920
between you and I.

1:10:56.953 --> 1:11:00.189
- Yeah, I mean, I definitely
felt the tension too.

1:11:00.223 --> 1:11:02.191
- I wanted to clear this up
before the week--

1:11:02.225 --> 1:11:06.062
before we got out here, but you
didn't even respond to my text.

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:08.231
So now we have to talk
about it now.

1:11:08.332 --> 1:11:11.100
Cristina and I have had
a lot of great moments

1:11:11.134 --> 1:11:12.168
in our friendship.

1:11:12.201 --> 1:11:13.169
We met in L.A.

1:11:13.202 --> 1:11:14.371
She was a reporter.

1:11:14.404 --> 1:11:15.372
I'm a publicist.

1:11:15.405 --> 1:11:17.374
I became her forever plus-one.

1:11:17.407 --> 1:11:18.942
She is a lot of fun,

1:11:18.975 --> 1:11:23.347
but she changed, and I don't
really have time for her drama.

1:11:23.347 --> 1:11:24.481
I live with you.

1:11:24.514 --> 1:11:25.749
I'm around you all the time.

1:11:25.782 --> 1:11:28.485
I feel like you talk about your
boyfriend all the time.

1:11:28.518 --> 1:11:30.153
- I don't talk about my
boyfriend all the time,

1:11:30.186 --> 1:11:32.221
Cristina, but he is a big
part of my life.

1:11:32.255 --> 1:11:34.257
So if I mention his name,

1:11:34.358 --> 1:11:36.660
that's not for you to roll
your eyes or get so upset

1:11:36.693 --> 1:11:37.794
because I mentioned
his name, like--

1:11:37.827 --> 1:11:39.363
he's a huge part of my life.

1:11:39.363 --> 1:11:42.466
I sleep at his apartment more
than I sleep at our apartment.

1:11:42.499 --> 1:11:44.133
- I just don't think
it's a great idea

1:11:44.167 --> 1:11:45.735
to live with somebody full-time

1:11:45.769 --> 1:11:47.203
as a roommate in the city

1:11:47.236 --> 1:11:48.538
and then do a summer house
with them.

1:11:48.572 --> 1:11:49.806
- You have no escape.

1:11:49.839 --> 1:11:51.575
Whatever issue's going on,
you have no time

1:11:51.608 --> 1:11:52.676
to just decompress from it.

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:53.943
It's just constantly
in your face.

1:11:53.977 --> 1:11:54.944
- Well, you just
never get a break.

1:11:54.978 --> 1:11:56.079
- Yeah.
- I mean, Lauren,

1:11:56.112 --> 1:11:57.381
even you and I need
a break sometimes.

1:11:57.381 --> 1:11:59.749
Like, you cannot be
with somebody 24/7.

1:11:59.783 --> 1:12:01.385
- I'm not around you
all the time anymore

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:02.652
because I have a boyfriend.

1:12:02.686 --> 1:12:04.053
So maybe that's what
your issue is.

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:05.188
You don't know how
to articulate it.

1:12:05.221 --> 1:12:06.490
- I don't have a problem
with you guys

1:12:06.523 --> 1:12:07.691
being in a relationship.

1:12:07.724 --> 1:12:09.526
- Then I don't know
what bothers you,

1:12:09.559 --> 1:12:11.628
but it's coming across to me,

1:12:11.661 --> 1:12:13.229
you're jealous,
you're not happy,

1:12:13.262 --> 1:12:14.664
and you're bitter.

1:12:14.698 --> 1:12:16.099
- The fact that Lindsay
thinks I'm jealous

1:12:16.132 --> 1:12:17.867
of her and Everett
is hilarious.

1:12:17.901 --> 1:12:19.703
Everett has been our friend
for years,

1:12:19.736 --> 1:12:21.538
and if any of us girls
wanted him,

1:12:21.571 --> 1:12:23.507
we could've had him
a long time ago.

1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:26.643
- You brought it up
so much last weekend.

1:12:26.676 --> 1:12:28.812
So many times--
in the car ride on Monday,

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:30.246
when you were with Stephen--
- Well, you know why?

1:12:30.279 --> 1:12:31.948
'Cause I was in a car ride with
you for three and half hours,

1:12:31.981 --> 1:12:36.520
and the entire time, you sit and
talk and talk about yourself.

1:12:37.721 --> 1:12:39.789
- You think that I'm selfish.

1:12:39.823 --> 1:12:41.124
Fine, no problem.

1:12:41.157 --> 1:12:42.426
This started a couple
of years ago

1:12:42.426 --> 1:12:43.460
when we got into an argument,

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:44.861
and I told you right
then and there

1:12:44.894 --> 1:12:47.230
that I was probably not gonna
tell you a lot of things,

1:12:47.263 --> 1:12:48.765
so suck it.
- You tell me a lot of things.

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:50.634
You don't ask me anything
about myself.

1:12:50.667 --> 1:12:53.302
I have no problem with you guys
being together.

1:12:53.336 --> 1:12:54.838
I'm happy for you both.

1:12:54.871 --> 1:12:57.273
I think it's great that you guys
are in a relationship.

1:12:57.306 --> 1:12:59.509
However, sometimes
I need a break

1:12:59.543 --> 1:13:01.545
and you to give and ask
about my life.

1:13:01.578 --> 1:13:04.914
- Okay, I'll do more
of an effort to care.

1:13:04.948 --> 1:13:06.282
- All right.

1:13:06.315 --> 1:13:09.519
- But if I hear something
else come out of your mouth

1:13:09.553 --> 1:13:10.520
about Everett and I,

1:13:10.554 --> 1:13:13.657
I'm gonna have a big problem.

1:13:13.690 --> 1:13:16.660
[upbeat music]

1:13:16.693 --> 1:13:19.028
*

1:13:19.062 --> 1:13:20.464
- Hello.

1:13:20.464 --> 1:13:22.198
- Sure, what are the ladies
over there drinking?

1:13:22.231 --> 1:13:23.600
- Rosé.

1:13:23.633 --> 1:13:26.069
- Can you send a bottle
of rosé to them?

1:13:26.102 --> 1:13:27.704
Please, and don't tell them
it's from us.

1:13:27.737 --> 1:13:28.972
- They'll never know.

1:13:29.005 --> 1:13:30.740
I will go with the smoked salmon
Benedict, please.

1:13:30.774 --> 1:13:32.175
- Likewise.
Smoked salmon, please.

1:13:32.208 --> 1:13:34.511
- Can I do scrambled eggs?
- Thank you.

1:13:34.544 --> 1:13:35.845
- Thank you.

1:13:35.879 --> 1:13:37.013
I'm not gonna try to put you
on the spot right now,

1:13:37.046 --> 1:13:38.948
but indirectly, I am.

1:13:38.982 --> 1:13:42.619
All I heard was that there
was, like, ring talk.

1:13:44.588 --> 1:13:45.622
- What?

1:13:45.655 --> 1:13:47.090
- Hotline ring?

1:13:47.123 --> 1:13:50.660
- What I have with Lindsay
is actually really special.

1:13:50.694 --> 1:13:53.497
We spent two years getting
to know each other.

1:13:53.530 --> 1:13:55.198
This was like the ultimate
slow play.

1:13:55.231 --> 1:13:57.133
And we have, like, such
a strong foundation.

1:13:57.166 --> 1:13:59.268
Her and I could go live
in a cardboard box.

1:13:59.302 --> 1:14:00.804
We'd be perfectly
happy together.

1:14:00.837 --> 1:14:02.806
- Love it.
- There's a point when you know

1:14:02.839 --> 1:14:05.141
things work with somebody,
and you don't need to go through

1:14:05.174 --> 1:14:07.043
that whole tap-dance
that people do

1:14:07.076 --> 1:14:09.378
with dating in New York, 'cause
dating in New York sucks...

1:14:09.412 --> 1:14:11.014
for girls.

1:14:11.047 --> 1:14:12.982
[laughing]

1:14:13.016 --> 1:14:15.351
- I feel like your first date
was, like, two months ago.

1:14:15.384 --> 1:14:16.820
- I just explained it to you.

1:14:16.853 --> 1:14:18.822
Do you need, like,
a cotton swab for your ears?

1:14:18.855 --> 1:14:20.557
- I heard all of it,

1:14:20.590 --> 1:14:22.258
and I took a massive
grain of salt.

1:14:22.291 --> 1:14:24.060
- Lindsay and I have been
talking about being together

1:14:24.093 --> 1:14:26.996
since we met two and half
years ago.

1:14:27.030 --> 1:14:29.065
- Well, I didn't know that.

1:14:29.098 --> 1:14:30.066
- [imitates brakes screeching]

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:32.435
Dude, what the f---?

1:14:32.536 --> 1:14:34.370
You just started dating
this girl, relax.

1:14:34.403 --> 1:14:36.039
- We always knew
there was a spark.

1:14:36.072 --> 1:14:37.440
- You are a new couple.

1:14:37.541 --> 1:14:38.708
Enjoy the honeymoon phase.

1:14:38.742 --> 1:14:40.910
Don't talk about life decisions.

1:14:40.944 --> 1:14:42.111
You're freaking me out.

1:14:42.145 --> 1:14:44.548
[indistinct chatter]

1:14:44.548 --> 1:14:46.215
Say thanks to them.

1:14:46.249 --> 1:14:47.617
all: Thank you.

1:14:47.651 --> 1:14:49.553
- Oh, oh, you figured it out?

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:51.454
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1:14:51.555 --> 1:14:53.289
- Is it your birthday?

1:14:53.322 --> 1:14:54.423
- Happy birthday.

1:14:54.457 --> 1:14:55.424
- We thought so.

1:14:55.458 --> 1:14:57.561
[cheering]

1:14:57.561 --> 1:14:59.195
- Yeah, rosé all day.

1:14:59.228 --> 1:15:00.730
- I'm getting wandering eyes.

1:15:00.764 --> 1:15:01.731
I'll be right back.

1:15:01.765 --> 1:15:03.633
- All right, go check it out.

1:15:03.667 --> 1:15:05.769
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

1:15:05.802 --> 1:15:08.772
- What's weird is, like,
three months ago,

1:15:08.805 --> 1:15:10.106
you would've been...

1:15:10.139 --> 1:15:11.908
- I know.

1:15:11.941 --> 1:15:14.143
- I'm doing a knee thing,
'cause I feel like I'm like--

1:15:14.177 --> 1:15:15.912
I would be towering over you.

1:15:15.945 --> 1:15:17.881
[speaks indistinctly]
[laughter]

1:15:17.914 --> 1:15:19.816
- Here.

1:15:19.849 --> 1:15:21.885
Sorry, boys I need a--
- No, it's fine.

1:15:21.918 --> 1:15:23.219
- You guys can stay there.
- Hey, Carl, no.

1:15:23.252 --> 1:15:24.420
We're starting a--
I sense a theme.

1:15:24.453 --> 1:15:26.189
It's like, "See you later."

1:15:26.222 --> 1:15:27.423
- What's your name?

1:15:27.456 --> 1:15:28.758
- Dominique.
- Dominique? Carl.

1:15:28.792 --> 1:15:29.926
- Hi, Carl.
- How are you?

1:15:29.959 --> 1:15:31.360
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1:15:31.394 --> 1:15:32.896
- What are we eating?
French toast?

1:15:32.929 --> 1:15:34.197
[indistinct speech]

1:15:34.230 --> 1:15:35.231
You mind if I take a bite?

1:15:35.264 --> 1:15:36.866
How do you go?
Just, like, hand in?

1:15:36.900 --> 1:15:38.768
- Yeah.
- And, like, one of these?

1:15:38.802 --> 1:15:42.706
[laughter]

1:15:42.739 --> 1:15:44.307
Is that weird?
- No.

1:15:46.509 --> 1:15:49.478
[driving dance music]

1:16:01.625 --> 1:16:01.858
- * Oh

1:16:02.959 --> 1:16:04.828
* You know, you know

1:16:04.861 --> 1:16:06.896
* You know, you know

1:16:06.930 --> 1:16:14.638
*

1:16:14.638 --> 1:16:17.641
* You are truly fine

1:16:17.674 --> 1:16:19.142
- We're kicking off Mexican
theme night at our house

1:16:19.175 --> 1:16:20.209
with a tequila shot.

1:16:20.243 --> 1:16:21.277
- It's Mexican theme night?

1:16:21.310 --> 1:16:23.046
- What's more American
than Mexico?

1:16:23.079 --> 1:16:24.648
[laughter]

1:16:24.648 --> 1:16:26.983
- Who need lime?
- I need Lyme... disease.

1:16:27.016 --> 1:16:28.852
- Get it from Lauren.
- Suck the tick out of her.

1:16:28.885 --> 1:16:30.553
- Stop it.

1:16:30.654 --> 1:16:32.055
- Tequila.

1:16:32.088 --> 1:16:36.359
all: Tequila!

1:16:36.392 --> 1:16:38.161
- Whoo!

1:16:38.194 --> 1:16:40.496
- Oof. Yup.

1:16:40.529 --> 1:16:42.231
- Okay, what needs
to get chopped?

1:16:42.265 --> 1:16:43.933
- I'm getting everything else
that gets chopped right now.

1:16:43.967 --> 1:16:45.869
We're prepping stuff
for taco stuff

1:16:45.902 --> 1:16:47.036
plus taco salad.

1:16:47.070 --> 1:16:49.205
Cheese, tomatoes--

1:16:49.238 --> 1:16:50.539
let's put a little
butter in here.

1:16:50.573 --> 1:16:51.675
- Okay.

1:16:51.675 --> 1:16:54.878
- Look at me and my salad.

1:16:54.911 --> 1:16:57.346
- I think this might be, like,
caustic to drink.

1:16:57.380 --> 1:16:59.282
- That's a good word.
- Most of my vocab is from--

1:16:59.315 --> 1:17:00.884
is from seventh grade
English class.

1:17:00.917 --> 1:17:01.951
- How'd you learn how to swear?

1:17:01.985 --> 1:17:03.552
- I would say, like,
the army for sure.

1:17:03.586 --> 1:17:04.688
- Do they swear in the army?

1:17:04.721 --> 1:17:05.855
- Do they swear in the army?

1:17:05.889 --> 1:17:07.724
- I would never know.

1:17:07.757 --> 1:17:09.092
I would never assume, either.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:11.294
- You speak in acronyms
and profanities.

1:17:11.327 --> 1:17:12.595
- Really?
- Honestly, the whole thing

1:17:12.696 --> 1:17:14.230
is like a parallel life
that I had.

1:17:14.263 --> 1:17:18.067
It doesn't--it's crazy that I
used to do what I used to do.

1:17:18.101 --> 1:17:21.070
After college, I was
commissioned as an officer.

1:17:21.104 --> 1:17:22.105
I was Second Lieutenant.

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:24.240
My job was to go find bombs

1:17:24.273 --> 1:17:26.575
and blow them up with C4
before they blew us up.

1:17:26.609 --> 1:17:30.513
I got back from Iraq
on July 4th of 2009.

1:17:30.546 --> 1:17:33.082
It took me a couple years
from getting out of the army

1:17:33.116 --> 1:17:34.317
and living in New York

1:17:34.350 --> 1:17:35.551
for me to get acclimated.

1:17:35.584 --> 1:17:37.186
- Am I walking in on something?

1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:38.187
- No, you aren't.

1:17:38.221 --> 1:17:39.723
- In Iraq, we had
trucks that had,

1:17:39.756 --> 1:17:41.157
like, radio systems.

1:17:41.190 --> 1:17:42.291
- What kind of trucks?
Like, Hummers?

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:45.028
- MRAPs: Mine-Resistant
Assault Protected.

1:17:45.061 --> 1:17:46.996
Dude, I got hit one time
by a bomb.

1:17:47.030 --> 1:17:50.033
It shredded all tires,
all sides.

1:17:50.066 --> 1:17:51.400
- I got to throw
this sh-- away.

1:17:51.434 --> 1:17:53.737
- There was a piece of shrapnel
about this far away

1:17:53.770 --> 1:17:54.871
from, like, my abdomen.

1:17:54.904 --> 1:17:56.773
And it just, like,
stopped by the grace of God.

1:17:56.806 --> 1:17:58.141
Would've ripped me in two.

1:17:58.174 --> 1:17:59.743
- Wow.

1:17:59.776 --> 1:18:01.644
- Yeah.

1:18:06.215 --> 1:18:08.752
- [sniffing]

1:18:11.855 --> 1:18:12.889
- Man, I know...

[somber music]

1:18:14.623 --> 1:18:15.825
Come here, buddy.

1:18:15.859 --> 1:18:23.800
*

1:18:23.833 --> 1:18:25.534
Certain elements from
my time in service

1:18:25.568 --> 1:18:26.936
bring me back a little bit.

1:18:26.970 --> 1:18:29.172
When you go out every day,
and you don't know

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:32.141
if any of you guys are
coming back or not...

1:18:32.175 --> 1:18:33.576
it's weird to think about.

1:18:33.609 --> 1:18:35.879
It's like a...
[clears throat]

1:18:35.912 --> 1:18:41.417
It's like a parallel life
that wasn't mine.

1:18:41.450 --> 1:18:42.986
*

1:18:43.019 --> 1:18:44.487
- Hey, Ev and Kyle?

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:45.521
- Yeah.
- Dinner's ready.

1:18:45.554 --> 1:18:46.823
- All right.
- Okay?

1:18:46.856 --> 1:18:48.324
- Okay, we'll be right there.
- Take a second.

1:18:48.357 --> 1:18:50.693
I'm here to help, man.

1:18:50.794 --> 1:18:54.597
- Dude, come here...

1:18:54.630 --> 1:18:55.799
I appreciate it.

1:18:55.832 --> 1:18:56.966
- I'm hangry.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.434
- This is amazing.

1:18:58.467 --> 1:18:59.702
- What sauce with this?

1:18:59.803 --> 1:19:01.170
- Hot sauce.

1:19:01.204 --> 1:19:02.806
- Oh, my God, there's fireworks,
you guys.

1:19:02.806 --> 1:19:04.107
Way!
- Way!

1:19:04.140 --> 1:19:05.408
- Let's go out.

1:19:05.441 --> 1:19:07.610
- * Whoa

1:19:07.643 --> 1:19:08.812
- Oh, my, gosh,
it's crazy.

1:19:08.812 --> 1:19:10.479
I just love fireworks.

1:19:10.513 --> 1:19:12.148
- I like the metallic-looking
ones.

1:19:12.181 --> 1:19:13.716
- Yeah.
- Aren't they all metallic?

1:19:13.817 --> 1:19:15.384
- No, no.

1:19:15.418 --> 1:19:17.253
- Where I'm from in Alabama,

1:19:17.286 --> 1:19:18.955
they don't do fireworks
on the 4th.

1:19:18.988 --> 1:19:21.190
- Why?
- They do fireworks in August

1:19:21.224 --> 1:19:22.558
because they get them on sale.

1:19:22.591 --> 1:19:24.627
[laughter]

1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:26.830
- Excuse me.
- Oh, okay, we'll let you in.

1:19:26.863 --> 1:19:27.831
Sorry.
- We'll let you in.

1:19:27.864 --> 1:19:29.065
- I want to balance out
your height.

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:31.200
- You guys, we need to do
our own fireworks.

1:19:31.234 --> 1:19:33.036
- Ready?
- Fire in the hole!

1:19:33.069 --> 1:19:35.604
- Whoa!

1:19:35.638 --> 1:19:39.375
[laughter]

1:19:39.408 --> 1:19:40.844
- Take two.

1:19:40.844 --> 1:19:42.045
- Oh, sh--!

1:19:42.078 --> 1:19:43.312
Oh, sh--!

1:19:43.346 --> 1:19:46.349
[all cheering]

1:19:54.490 --> 1:19:56.459
- Holy f---!

1:19:56.492 --> 1:19:58.061
- Oh, my God, I literally
burned myself.

1:19:58.094 --> 1:19:59.462
- Oh, my God.

1:19:59.495 --> 1:20:01.064
- Team.
- Oh, my God.

1:20:01.097 --> 1:20:02.265
- That was awesome.

1:20:02.298 --> 1:20:03.432
Come on, guys,
let's get dressed.

1:20:05.835 --> 1:20:06.870
- I did.

1:20:08.337 --> 1:20:09.305
What do you think about guys
that get pedicures?

1:20:09.338 --> 1:20:10.573
- Oh, you should.
- I sit like--

1:20:10.606 --> 1:20:11.774
- I can tell--that's, like,
the way you're--

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:13.109
You're very clean,
like from head to toe.

1:20:13.142 --> 1:20:14.810
- Thank you.
- I like that.

1:20:14.844 --> 1:20:17.013
Carl is definitely someone
that I'm attracted to.

1:20:17.046 --> 1:20:19.615
His name is Carl, and he's hot.

1:20:19.648 --> 1:20:21.350
He's hot Carl.

1:20:21.384 --> 1:20:23.119
- Let's go, lovebirds.
We got to go.

1:20:23.152 --> 1:20:26.122
[driving dance music]

1:20:26.155 --> 1:20:32.996
*

1:20:33.029 --> 1:20:34.830
- You guys have, like,
a whole palace in here.

1:20:34.864 --> 1:20:36.332
- By the way--
- What?

1:20:36.365 --> 1:20:37.867
*

1:20:37.901 --> 1:20:39.768
- When are we leaving, really?
When are we leaving?

1:20:39.802 --> 1:20:42.071
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

1:20:42.105 --> 1:20:43.139
- [speaks indistinctly]

1:20:43.172 --> 1:20:46.342
Stephen, you ready?
Ready?

1:20:46.375 --> 1:20:47.476
- We're going up.

1:20:47.510 --> 1:20:54.517
*

1:21:11.167 --> 1:21:12.835
- Like, uh...

1:21:18.674 --> 1:21:19.943
- I'm new.

1:21:19.943 --> 1:21:21.177
I don't know Ashley.

1:21:21.210 --> 1:21:22.811
Stephen and I are just getting
to know each other.

1:21:22.845 --> 1:21:24.547
Everett and Kyle--
we're boys,

1:21:24.580 --> 1:21:26.349
but at a club, I'm not really
hanging out with guys.

1:21:26.382 --> 1:21:27.683
Who am I gonna talk to?

1:21:27.716 --> 1:21:29.485
Oh, the blond girl
that's attractive

1:21:29.518 --> 1:21:31.720
and also is, like, smiling
and wanting to hang out with me.

1:21:31.754 --> 1:21:33.056
It's a no-brainer.

1:21:33.089 --> 1:21:35.191
That's day two of man school.

1:21:35.224 --> 1:21:39.462
*

1:21:39.495 --> 1:21:41.230
- Look at your situation.

1:21:41.264 --> 1:21:43.366
- Oh, my f---ing God.

1:21:43.399 --> 1:21:50.406
*

1:22:18.834 --> 1:22:21.137
- Carl's still not making moves.

1:22:23.206 --> 1:22:25.608
*

1:22:25.641 --> 1:22:27.276
I got to take things
into my own hands here.

1:22:27.310 --> 1:22:29.245
*

1:22:29.278 --> 1:22:31.014
Yeah, I want to see it.

1:22:31.047 --> 1:22:35.718
*

1:22:35.751 --> 1:22:37.253
I'm pulling you in
for a kiss.

1:22:37.286 --> 1:22:44.293
*

1:22:47.530 --> 1:22:49.298
- Holy sh--.

1:22:49.332 --> 1:22:50.499
We have an inter-house hookup.

1:22:50.533 --> 1:22:52.601

1:22:58.241 --> 1:22:58.674
[soft dance music]

1:23:01.210 --> 1:23:04.147
*

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:06.949
- The chemistry between
Lauren and Carl is very real.

1:23:07.050 --> 1:23:08.284
- Are you coming
with Ashley and I?

1:23:08.317 --> 1:23:09.718
- Yeah, we're coming.

1:23:09.752 --> 1:23:12.121
- But if that mother----er Carl
breaks her heart,

1:23:12.155 --> 1:23:14.057
he better run and hide,

1:23:14.057 --> 1:23:16.659
because I will be after him.

1:23:19.395 --> 1:23:22.365
[energetic music]

1:23:22.398 --> 1:23:29.172
*

1:23:29.205 --> 1:23:31.707
- Lauren's hot.
Lauren's fun.

1:23:31.740 --> 1:23:33.676
But you hook up with someone
in your summer house,

1:23:33.709 --> 1:23:36.579
it just causes a lot of drama.

1:23:36.612 --> 1:23:38.081
I don't want any drama.

1:23:38.114 --> 1:23:39.682
I want everybody to be happy
and have fun.

1:23:39.715 --> 1:23:41.350
But I do like Lauren.

1:23:45.688 --> 1:23:47.923
- Once I see myself
liking someone...

1:23:50.659 --> 1:23:51.860
- I'm 100% in.

1:23:51.894 --> 1:23:58.901
*

1:24:00.103 --> 1:24:01.837
- This season on
"Summer House"...

1:24:01.870 --> 1:24:04.373
- Oh, yeah!

1:24:04.407 --> 1:24:06.309
- Let's get twisted!

1:24:06.342 --> 1:24:08.911
[all cheering]

1:24:08.944 --> 1:24:10.513
- See your nipples!

1:24:10.546 --> 1:24:12.415
- That happened
in our Jacuzzi?

1:24:12.448 --> 1:24:13.882
- [shouts indistinctly]

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:15.851
- We're nine friends

1:24:15.884 --> 1:24:17.353
living
in a summer house together.

1:24:17.386 --> 1:24:18.687
Nothing's really off-limits.

1:24:18.721 --> 1:24:19.955
- Who's farting?

1:24:19.988 --> 1:24:21.757
- What knucklehead did this?

1:24:21.790 --> 1:24:23.226
Like...

1:24:23.259 --> 1:24:25.728
you don't put bananas
in a freezer.

1:24:25.761 --> 1:24:27.863
- Who's sharing what beds?
Who's sharing what rooms?

1:24:27.896 --> 1:24:29.932
- I'll sleep wherever
I have to sleep

1:24:29.965 --> 1:24:31.667
to end this conversation.

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:33.001
- Ha!

1:24:33.035 --> 1:24:35.971
[upbeat music]

1:24:36.004 --> 1:24:38.707
- Turning 30 means, like, you
got to get your sh-- together.

1:24:38.741 --> 1:24:40.943
It's scary to think that
I'll be leaving New York.

1:24:40.976 --> 1:24:42.010
- I think you should be
thinking about

1:24:42.044 --> 1:24:43.379
us moving in together.

1:24:43.412 --> 1:24:46.982
- I know I need to grow up
starting after Labor Day.

1:24:47.015 --> 1:24:47.983
- [screaming]

1:24:48.016 --> 1:24:49.285
- Wieners are out.

1:24:49.318 --> 1:24:51.154
- I actually made out
with Jacqueline.

1:24:51.187 --> 1:24:53.556
- What else, Kyle?

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:55.158
- Last weekend,
I kissed Katie.

1:24:55.191 --> 1:24:56.725
- This is bullsh--.

1:24:56.759 --> 1:24:58.494
- What'd you type?
- "Tall, dark, and handsome."

1:24:58.527 --> 1:25:00.829
- Yeah! Yeah!

1:25:00.863 --> 1:25:03.232
[crash]
- I just broke the bed.

1:25:03.266 --> 1:25:05.368
- Lindsay said that she
might move in with Everett.

1:25:05.401 --> 1:25:08.204
At the bonfire,
she's all up on Carl.

1:25:08.237 --> 1:25:10.173
- She just loves to gossip.

1:25:10.206 --> 1:25:11.907
- You need to shut the f--- up.

1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:13.576
- What?

1:25:13.609 --> 1:25:15.444
All you want to do right now
is just have fun

1:25:15.478 --> 1:25:16.712
with or without me.

1:25:16.745 --> 1:25:17.946
- I don't know
what to tell you.

1:25:20.015 --> 1:25:22.785
- Then tell me what
happened, Everett.

1:25:22.818 --> 1:25:24.720
- No matter what I do, it's
gonna be under a microscope.

1:25:24.753 --> 1:25:26.355
I was made to feel like I'm
pulling wool over her eyes,

1:25:26.389 --> 1:25:27.656
and I'm not trying
to do that.

1:25:27.690 --> 1:25:30.359
- That guy is a player.
- I don't understand.

1:25:30.393 --> 1:25:32.060
Like, what am I doing wrong?

1:25:32.094 --> 1:25:34.397
- Right now, I just can't
be in a relationship.

1:25:34.430 --> 1:25:35.631
- Well, you know what?

1:25:35.664 --> 1:25:37.065
I'm gonna go sleep
at a guy's house tonight--

1:25:37.099 --> 1:25:38.567
with a guy, in a bed.

1:25:38.601 --> 1:25:39.935
- I deserve so much
better than that.

1:25:39.968 --> 1:25:41.103
- You're not welcome
next weekend.

1:25:41.204 --> 1:25:42.405
- It's not your call
to make, Lindsay.

1:25:42.438 --> 1:25:44.473
- You're a guest.
- You're a bitch.

1:25:44.507 --> 1:25:46.509
- What the f--- am I
doing with my life?

1:25:46.542 --> 1:25:49.545
- You're not getting it.

1:25:49.578 --> 1:25:51.214
And I'll f---ing pour my drink
on your face right now.

1:25:51.214 --> 1:25:52.215
- You guys are a joke.

1:25:52.248 --> 1:25:53.682
[indistinct screaming]

1:25:56.252 --> 1:25:59.222
- [crying]
- Um...

1:25:59.222 --> 1:26:01.257
I think I'll get the check.
