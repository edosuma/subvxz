01:53.800 --> 01:55.560
I need to go back there now!

01:55.600 --> 01:57.040
Ok.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.160
Uum... If these elves

02:02.161 --> 02:03.920
or whatever are in danger

02:03.960 --> 02:06.520
does that mean you are too?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.280
Hey, that's a really

02:08.281 --> 02:10.000
good question!

02:10.039 --> 02:11.220
- It doesn't matter.

02:11.221 --> 02:12.400
- Of course it does!

02:12.440 --> 02:14.120
- You've done enough
- for them already.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
We don't want to lose you

02:15.161 --> 02:16.161
in the real world.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.240
[sighs]

02:20.960 --> 02:22.780
Guys, I appreciate that you're

02:22.781 --> 02:24.600
worried about me. I really do.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.600
But I can take care of myself.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.896
- And if there's anybody who
- taught me that, it's you guys.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.120
I love you both

02:30.121 --> 02:31.320
for looking after me.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.280
Now get out of my way.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.040
I need a password.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.840
Wait a second.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.000
Something's happening!

02:49.040 --> 02:51.640
[Vincent] Whoa. That's cool.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.120
It's never done this

02:53.121 --> 02:54.560
before. [gasps] Look!

02:54.600 --> 02:56.080
[Gargona] I must have

02:56.081 --> 02:57.560
that little unicorn!

03:02.120 --> 03:04.080
- I need to find the last piece
- of the Trumptus,

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
It's the only thing

03:05.121 --> 03:06.121
that can save us!

03:07.240 --> 03:08.440
Wow.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.840
- [Vincent] Has it ever been
- that bright?

03:11.880 --> 03:13.800
No!

03:13.840 --> 03:15.720
- Looks like I'm going back
- one more time!

03:21.360 --> 03:23.120
What does it say?

03:23.160 --> 03:24.300
"You are needed now

03:24.301 --> 03:25.440
more than ever."

03:28.920 --> 03:30.880
Hi Mia. Say your password.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.680
- "You are needed now
- more than ever."

03:45.200 --> 03:46.920
I hope she's careful.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.600
[screams]

04:01.440 --> 04:02.560
[gasps]

04:11.680 --> 04:13.520
Onchao?! Phuddle?!

04:13.560 --> 04:14.960
Psst!

04:17.600 --> 04:18.680
Aahh...

04:24.120 --> 04:25.280
Onchao!

04:25.320 --> 04:28.040
Are we glad to see you!

04:28.080 --> 04:29.740
If it wasn't for my brilliant

04:29.741 --> 04:31.400
idea to hide down here...

04:31.440 --> 04:32.460
- [Onchao snorts]

04:32.461 --> 04:33.480
- Okay, okay.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.260
He left the nest

04:35.261 --> 04:37.000
and I sort of followed him.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.440
[neighs]

04:38.480 --> 04:41.760
Now can we go home? Pleeeease?!

04:41.800 --> 04:42.880
Not without the last piece

04:42.881 --> 04:43.960
of the Trumptus.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.896
- And I'm not getting back
- into Panthea's palace

04:45.920 --> 04:47.320
Without Yuko and Mo.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.440
[neighs softly]

04:52.480 --> 04:54.000
No, stay with Phuddle.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.600
You'll be safe here.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.160
Well, safer.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.960
- Yuko.
- DING DING!

05:02.200 --> 05:04.320
"Safe?!" Sure...

05:04.360 --> 05:05.740
we're only stuck in the

05:05.741 --> 05:07.120
middle of the munculus lands!

05:07.160 --> 05:08.220
Next time why doesn't

05:08.221 --> 05:09.280
she stay here

05:09.320 --> 05:11.400
and we'll go to the unicorn pen.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.600
[neighs angrily]

05:14.520 --> 05:16.200
What I meant to say was...

05:16.240 --> 05:18.040
we'll go to the unicorn pen.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.060
No, wait, that's the same thing

05:20.061 --> 05:22.040
I said the first time.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.560
[neighs]

05:23.600 --> 05:25.000
Forget it!

05:25.001 --> 05:26.400
Mia said to stay here!

05:27.400 --> 05:29.800
Wooooaa!

05:29.840 --> 05:32.480
[Mo grunts with effort]

05:32.520 --> 05:33.960
What?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.720
Mo! Look! Mia's coming!

05:36.760 --> 05:37.760
[gasps]

05:37.761 --> 05:38.761
We gotta get this open

05:38.800 --> 05:39.980
before she falls into

05:39.981 --> 05:41.160
the same trap we did.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.720
[grunts]

05:42.760 --> 05:44.280
[approaching footsteps]

05:44.320 --> 05:45.920
Mmm?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.720
[gasps] Mia?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.000
That's not Mia.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.100
[coughs] Once again,

05:59.101 --> 06:00.760
you have failed me!

06:00.800 --> 06:02.760
- All you had to do
- was capture

06:02.800 --> 06:04.620
One tiny little unicorn!

06:04.621 --> 06:06.440
[coughs]

06:06.480 --> 06:08.520
But... you were leading

06:08.521 --> 06:10.560
the army yourself, my Queen!

06:10.600 --> 06:12.260
Don't try to blame me!

06:12.261 --> 06:13.920
[coughs]

06:13.960 --> 06:16.160
- Everything bad is your fault!
- [coughs]

06:17.600 --> 06:19.320
Yes, my Queen.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.040
[muncs shriek]

06:31.840 --> 06:33.400
Yuko?! Mo?!

06:34.240 --> 06:35.960
[neigh]

06:36.000 --> 06:37.400
A trap? Is that what happened

06:37.401 --> 06:38.800
to Yuko and Mo?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.040
[neighs]

06:45.080 --> 06:46.200
[gasps]

06:46.240 --> 06:47.560
Lyria!

06:50.320 --> 06:52.480
[neighs]

06:52.520 --> 06:53.540
I thought

06:53.541 --> 06:54.560
I'd never see you again!

06:54.600 --> 06:56.080
[neighs]

06:56.120 --> 06:57.600
Onchao's fine!

06:57.601 --> 06:59.080
He's somewhere safe.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.200
[Phuddle] Look ooout!!

07:00.201 --> 07:01.280
[screams]

07:01.320 --> 07:03.840
Or at least, he was.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.320
Aaaagh!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.400
You're a maniac, you know that?!

07:08.440 --> 07:09.480
Shh!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.320
[neigh]

07:21.280 --> 07:23.360
[sobs]

07:23.400 --> 07:26.640
I've just got a speck in my eye.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.040
What's happening?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.040
Is that supposed to happen?

07:45.440 --> 07:46.480
[neighs]

07:49.880 --> 07:51.720
Oh Lyria!

07:51.760 --> 07:53.080
[distant shrieking]

07:54.320 --> 07:56.000
[neighs]

07:56.040 --> 07:58.240
Lyria, Onchao, watch out!

07:58.280 --> 07:59.640
Keep your heads down.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.620
[Panthea] I said it all along

08:04.621 --> 08:06.200
but nobody listens.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.220
You must be the worst General

08:08.221 --> 08:10.200
in all of history Gargona!

08:10.240 --> 08:11.680
You'll never be able

08:11.681 --> 08:13.120
to fill my shoes

08:13.160 --> 08:14.280
and where did you learn

08:14.281 --> 08:15.400
to fly a dragon?

08:15.440 --> 08:17.040
Panthea's back.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.696
- That's not going
- to make it any easier

08:21.720 --> 08:22.780
To find the last piece

08:22.781 --> 08:23.840
of the Trumptus.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.400
[neighs]

08:25.440 --> 08:27.080
What do you mean you saw it?

08:27.120 --> 08:28.640
[neighs]

08:28.680 --> 08:30.320
She keeps it with her?!

08:30.360 --> 08:31.600
[snorts]

08:31.640 --> 08:33.320
No wonder we couldn't find it!

08:36.360 --> 08:37.760
I threw everything

08:37.760 --> 08:39.159
I had at them,

08:39.200 --> 08:41.440
and you still couldn't get

08:41.480 --> 08:45.680
that one tiny, helpless unicorn!

08:45.720 --> 08:48.560
[coughs]

08:48.600 --> 08:50.700
I am aging by the second!

08:50.701 --> 08:52.800
Look at me!

08:52.840 --> 08:54.680
[Gargona] I... I will tear

08:54.681 --> 08:56.520
the island apart, my Queen.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.360
There has to be another unicorn

08:58.361 --> 09:00.160
left somewhere.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.360
I don't want another unicorn.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.980
The little one with

09:04.981 --> 09:06.560
the golden horn is the only one

09:06.600 --> 09:08.300
that will stop me from emptying

09:08.301 --> 09:10.000
a bucket over your head

09:10.040 --> 09:11.300
until you shrink

09:11.301 --> 09:12.560
to the size of a pea,

09:12.600 --> 09:14.020
and then spitting you

09:14.021 --> 09:15.440
through a straw! [coughs]

09:15.480 --> 09:17.920
[gasps] My Queen!

09:17.960 --> 09:19.880
Prisoners!

09:19.920 --> 09:21.800
- I gotta tell you,
- you've got some great

09:21.840 --> 09:23.680
Guest rooms in this place!

09:23.720 --> 09:25.540
Yeah! Just the right amount

09:25.541 --> 09:27.360
of cold and dark.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.240
Baah! Foolish elves!

09:29.280 --> 09:31.400
You are defeated!

09:31.440 --> 09:33.200
[cackles]

09:34.360 --> 09:37.240
[cackling]

09:37.280 --> 09:39.800
- [Phuddle] Well... There's no way
- you're getting near Panthea

09:39.840 --> 09:41.920
Without getting caught.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.720
Mmm. You're right.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.800
Phuddle, see if you can

09:45.801 --> 09:46.840
get this gate open!

09:46.880 --> 09:48.680
And if you find the trap door,

09:48.720 --> 09:50.656
- see if you can get Yuko and Mo
- out while you're at it!

09:50.680 --> 09:53.520
Okay. What are you gonna do?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.120
What do you think?

09:55.121 --> 09:56.680
I'm going to get caught.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.760
[grunts with effort]

10:04.000 --> 10:05.540
Just gotta make sure

10:05.541 --> 10:07.080
the trap stays closed...

10:11.520 --> 10:12.920
[neighs]

10:17.760 --> 10:19.200
[neighing]

10:24.080 --> 10:25.720
Now if I could just

10:25.721 --> 10:27.360
get this latch open...

10:27.400 --> 10:28.640
[fluttering noise]

10:31.080 --> 10:32.120
[growls]

10:34.320 --> 10:37.880
Oh oh! Get your hooves crossed!

10:38.760 --> 10:40.080
RAAAHHHRRR!

10:41.280 --> 10:43.240
[grunting] No, that's not right!

10:43.280 --> 10:44.400
Ugh!

10:46.480 --> 10:47.520
Grrr.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.600
[screams]

10:53.640 --> 10:54.600
[hissing]

10:54.640 --> 10:56.760
Oh! Hi! Em...

10:56.800 --> 10:57.980
I'm having trouble

10:57.981 --> 10:59.160
with this door... yeah...

10:59.200 --> 11:00.380
would you mind...

11:00.381 --> 11:01.560
AAAHHHHH!

11:05.120 --> 11:06.360
Uh?

11:15.320 --> 11:16.840
RAAHHRR!

11:18.240 --> 11:19.400
[neighs]

11:20.360 --> 11:22.480
[neighs]

11:22.520 --> 11:23.920
That must be the dragon

11:23.921 --> 11:25.320
that Mia told me about!

11:25.360 --> 11:27.000
Baby Blue!

11:27.040 --> 11:28.260
Boy you sure showed up

11:28.261 --> 11:29.480
in the nick of time.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.700
They should call you

11:30.701 --> 11:31.880
"Baby out of the Blue"!

11:31.920 --> 11:32.960
[neighs]

11:35.240 --> 11:36.840
[shrieks]

11:37.960 --> 11:39.200
Doooh!

11:42.480 --> 11:43.720
[neighs]

11:45.680 --> 11:46.880
[unicorns stampeding]

11:46.920 --> 11:49.240
Aaah! Aaaaghhh!

11:57.400 --> 11:59.100
You will tell me

11:59.101 --> 12:00.800
where the unicorn is,

12:00.840 --> 12:03.020
if I have to wring it out of you

12:03.021 --> 12:05.200
with my bare hands!

12:05.240 --> 12:06.780
[Mia] That won't be necessary,

12:06.781 --> 12:08.320
Panthea!

12:08.360 --> 12:09.600
Mia!

12:10.800 --> 12:12.560
If you release those prisoners,

12:12.600 --> 12:13.780
and promise

12:13.781 --> 12:14.960
to leave Centopia forever,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.300
I'll tell you exactly

12:16.301 --> 12:17.600
where the unicorn is.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.920
Interesting.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.560
I didn't see that coming...

12:22.560 --> 12:24.080
Let me tell you

12:24.081 --> 12:25.600
what doesn't sound right.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.740
You would never

12:26.741 --> 12:27.840
give up that unicorn.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.420
Or any unicorn.

12:29.421 --> 12:30.960
For any reason.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.920
I know you elves too well.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.280
[coughs]

12:39.320 --> 12:40.520
[gasps]

12:40.560 --> 12:43.280
Our loyalty is to Centopia.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.280
If saving Centopia means

12:45.281 --> 12:47.240
giving up one unicorn...

12:47.280 --> 12:49.256
- [Panthea] Do you really think
- I'll believe that?

12:49.280 --> 12:51.640
[laughs and coughs]

12:51.680 --> 12:53.920
No. I was bluffing.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.300
I guess I forgot

12:55.301 --> 12:56.640
how wise and...

12:56.680 --> 12:58.000
old... you are.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.720
Old?!

12:59.760 --> 13:01.680
Truly you are very wise

13:01.720 --> 13:05.040
and very, very old.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.000
Yeah... you really are.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.120
Aaagh!

13:09.160 --> 13:12.440
I've never seen anybody so old.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.620
- Stop it!

13:13.621 --> 13:14.760
- Stop what?

13:14.800 --> 13:17.420
I was paying you a compliment,

13:17.421 --> 13:20.040
my wise and very old Queen.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.400
Aaaaaaaaagh!

13:22.440 --> 13:24.260
[hissing] Tell me

13:24.261 --> 13:26.080
where the unicorn is!

13:26.120 --> 13:28.060
I could do that.

13:28.061 --> 13:30.000
Or I could do this...

13:30.760 --> 13:32.160
Aaagh!

13:32.200 --> 13:33.240
[grunts]

13:33.280 --> 13:34.360
[pants]

13:34.400 --> 13:36.040
Aaaarghhh!

13:40.600 --> 13:42.460
- Good, Mia! Now go!

13:42.461 --> 13:44.320
- Not without you!

13:44.360 --> 13:46.480
Yaaaaah! Agh!

13:46.520 --> 13:49.120
Ahh... ahh... Ahh.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.000
I've got it, my queen!

13:52.040 --> 13:53.480
Ugggh!

13:55.320 --> 13:56.400
Agh!

13:57.320 --> 13:59.520
[grunts]

13:59.560 --> 14:01.920
Mia, go! We'll hold them off!

14:01.960 --> 14:03.720
[Panthea] Uuugh...

14:06.480 --> 14:08.040
Yaaah! GO!

14:10.880 --> 14:12.760
That was a nice try!

14:12.800 --> 14:15.560
But I've got you now.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.640
RAAAHRR!

14:17.680 --> 14:20.240
Aaaaaahhh!

14:20.280 --> 14:22.400
Take her for a ride!

14:23.560 --> 14:24.800
[screams]

14:26.120 --> 14:29.480
Aaaaaaaaahhh...

14:29.520 --> 14:30.720
I've got the piece!

14:30.721 --> 14:31.920
We need Onchao!

14:32.680 --> 14:33.760
Ugh!

14:36.600 --> 14:37.720
[neighing]

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
[neighs]

14:44.360 --> 14:46.840
[gasps] The unicorn!

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
[grunting]

14:55.480 --> 14:56.840
Thanks, little guy!

14:56.880 --> 14:58.120
Hah!

14:58.160 --> 14:59.360
Aah!

14:59.400 --> 15:01.240
Aaaagh!

15:01.280 --> 15:05.320
There there. Nice unicorn.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.520
Onchao! You know what to do!

15:08.840 --> 15:11.760
Come to kind Panthea!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.360
Go, Phuddle! Agh!

15:14.800 --> 15:17.480

15:17.520 --> 15:19.200
[grunts with effort]

15:20.880 --> 15:22.080
[Yuko] That's far enough,

15:22.081 --> 15:23.280
you old scarecrow!

15:23.320 --> 15:24.880
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
Nice unicorn.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.800
Panthea's got you!

15:31.840 --> 15:32.880
Phuddle!?

15:32.920 --> 15:34.680
Uuugh! Come on!

15:42.600 --> 15:44.840
Mia! The Trumptus!

15:44.880 --> 15:46.280
Agh!

15:47.520 --> 15:49.320

16:08.240 --> 16:09.800

16:10.720 --> 16:12.760
BLUUUUUUURPP!

16:12.800 --> 16:15.640

16:23.800 --> 16:25.000
[neighs]

16:41.040 --> 16:42.760
[neighing triumphantly]

16:43.800 --> 16:45.320
[neighs]

16:47.640 --> 16:49.640
Well, that's done.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.960
Who feels like a party?

16:55.360 --> 16:56.960
[fireworks whistling]

17:01.560 --> 17:04.280
[cheering]

17:06.160 --> 17:09.040

You overgrown lizzard!

18:06.600 --> 18:07.680

18:56.360 --> 18:58.760
Okay, so...

18:58.800 --> 19:00.440
what do we do now?

19:00.441 --> 19:02.080
You're bored already?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.960
- Well there's gotta be
- something to do.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.880
No use standing around here!

19:05.920 --> 19:07.400
There is something.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.480
Dance?

19:10.680 --> 19:11.720
Ugh...

19:11.760 --> 19:12.960
[Mo laughs]

19:13.000 --> 19:14.720
What are you standing there for?

19:14.760 --> 19:16.400
[giggles]

19:16.440 --> 19:17.900
[Mia] Now this is the Centopia

19:17.901 --> 19:19.360
I've read about!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.280
- [Mo] Does your book
- have a happy ending?

19:21.320 --> 19:22.840
[Mia] It does now!

19:33.720 --> 19:37.200
You call that dancing?! May I?

19:38.120 --> 19:40.600
[laughs]

19:40.640 --> 19:41.980
I wish Paula and Vincent

19:41.981 --> 19:43.320
could see this!

19:43.360 --> 19:44.480
[neighs]

19:48.040 --> 19:49.560
[Vincent] The last day of school

19:49.561 --> 19:51.080
fireworks will be starting soon.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.840
Vincent. Look!

19:57.680 --> 19:59.520
[cheering and fireworks]

20:03.200 --> 20:04.440
[Vincent] Whoa!

20:04.480 --> 20:07.200
Is that... Mia?!

20:11.560 --> 20:12.800
[Vincent] Mia?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.040
[gasps]

20:14.080 --> 20:15.720
I guess is time to go!

20:15.760 --> 20:17.160
[neighs]

20:17.200 --> 20:18.920
- [laughs] Good bye Onchao!
- [kisses]

20:18.960 --> 20:20.720
Good bye you guys!

20:20.760 --> 20:21.920
- [Mo] Bye Mia!

20:21.921 --> 20:23.080
- [Yuko] Good bye Mia!

20:35.160 --> 20:36.460
I heard you!

20:36.461 --> 20:37.760
How is that possible?!

20:37.800 --> 20:39.020
Forget hearing me,

20:39.021 --> 20:40.240
we could see you!

20:40.280 --> 20:42.720
You were riding on a flying

20:42.721 --> 20:45.160
unicorn! It was amazing!

20:45.200 --> 20:46.620
You learn something new

20:46.621 --> 20:48.040
from this thing every day.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.220
And you won't believe

20:49.221 --> 20:50.360
the day I had!

21:19.560 --> 21:20.840
[sighs]

21:20.880 --> 21:23.400
What's the matter?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.480
- I'm not going to see you guys
- for months.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.320
What's to like about that?

21:28.040 --> 21:29.400
And?

21:30.960 --> 21:32.140
[sighs] And I feel like

21:32.141 --> 21:33.320
the story's done.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.380
The Trumptus is fixed.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.400
They don't need me anymore.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.860
I'm going to see you guys

21:38.861 --> 21:40.280
in a couple of months, but...

21:40.320 --> 21:42.160
- I don't know
- if I'll ever go back there.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.520
[door opens]

21:47.480 --> 21:48.900
Traditionally, I say good-bye

21:48.901 --> 21:50.320
to everyone in their dorms

21:50.360 --> 21:52.360
at the end of the year.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.320
- But I'll make an exception
- for you guys.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.400
Violetta.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.580
Why are you looking at me

22:02.581 --> 22:04.120
that way? What's happening?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.600
I just wanted to thank you

22:05.601 --> 22:07.040
for making this semester

22:04.160 --> 22:07.040
so interesting.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.160
I learned a lot.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.240
I can't wait to see you

22:09.280 --> 22:11.120
as soon as the summer is over.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.720
Don't touch me.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.160
You are weird.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.700
She is weird.

22:22.701 --> 22:24.200
Your are both weird.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.480
[both laugh]

22:28.840 --> 22:30.300
Alright Mia, the car's

22:30.301 --> 22:31.760
at the door. Are you ready?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.400
I think I am.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.760
See you next year, okay?

22:47.320 --> 22:49.360
I knew you two would be friends.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.880
You did not!

22:50.920 --> 22:52.340
And for a long time

22:52.341 --> 22:53.760
neither did we.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.600
[Aunt] So was it good?

22:55.640 --> 22:57.660
Your first experience

22:57.661 --> 22:59.680
on your own in a new world?

22:59.720 --> 23:01.720
Which world do you mean?
