00:05.040 --> 00:09.390
There are some who say that
you knew about Jason's escape,

00:09.440 --> 00:10.710
even abetted it.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.630
Jason is innocent. He
does not deserve to die.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.820
Take her to the cells.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.270
Why is no-one here?

00:18.320 --> 00:19.870
Something's wrong.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.880
All hail!

00:36.960 --> 00:39.110
Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon...

00:39.160 --> 00:43.230
O megal' Ennosigai' ek
ses dnameos tode presso...

00:43.280 --> 00:46.470
eithe di' ophthalmon ton son
tade pragmath' horoien....

00:57.320 --> 01:00.320
The Priests are blessing
a new Oracle.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.989
She is calling to the gods.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.140
May they tell her to
grant us salvation.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.030
Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon...

01:23.960 --> 01:26.030
The gods have spoken.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.240
What did you see, my child?

01:39.880 --> 01:42.230
You must not be afraid.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.620
Tell us what they've said.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.830
They threatened vengeance.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.510
They spoke of destruction...

01:49.560 --> 01:51.470
desolation. Their...

01:51.520 --> 01:53.520
voices were raging.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.400
They were angry.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.230
Ready to fall upon us.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.280
Why?

02:03.080 --> 02:07.150
For the rightful heir to
Atlantis is not recognised.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.710
They say that until that day
people will never be at peace.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.990
She's lying.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.270
That is not possible.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.590
Cassandra's gifts allow her
to only speak the truth.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.390
Then she is mistaken in what
she sees. Take her away.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.040
Please... The girl is innocent!

02:26.320 --> 02:27.790
This will get out.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.990
The whole of Atlantis will soon
know that the gods are against me.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.870
~ Calm yourself.
~ You heard the Oracle!

02:31.920 --> 02:34.790
Indeed. She declared that the true
heir to Atlantis was not recognised.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.470
But who is the true heir?

02:36.520 --> 02:39.720
The gods did not state
that it was Ariadne.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.270
It is you, Majesty.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.830
The throne is rightfully yours

02:44.880 --> 02:48.150
and the gods in their wisdom
have spoken to warn you

02:48.200 --> 02:51.790
that you will not be truly recognised
as long as there remains

02:51.840 --> 02:53.590
one land and two queens.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.780
Then what shall we do?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.030
It is clear.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.680
You must make Ariadne renounce
her crown in favour of you.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.350
Then, when she has publicly
countenanced you,

03:06.400 --> 03:10.120
have the priests announce that
the prophecy has been fulfilled.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.990
Do what you will. I am
at peace with the gods.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.270
You think I'm going to kill you?

03:19.320 --> 03:22.620
I cannot predict what's
in your tangled mind.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.710
I will give you your freedom

03:27.760 --> 03:30.860
but first you must
do something for me.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.110
Renounce your title

03:33.160 --> 03:34.750
and swear an oath of allegiance

03:34.800 --> 03:38.000
recognising me as the
true heir of Atlantis.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.400
So the Oracle's prophecy
was not favourable.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.350
I'm giving you a chance to live.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.910
For the sake of everyone you hold
dear, I suggest you take it.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.070
I will not abandon my people.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.360
I will never relinquish
my throne to you.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.280
Then that is your decision.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.340
But it will not be you
who suffers for it.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.800
(Jason.)

04:23.960 --> 04:25.510
Talk to me.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.990
Please.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.390
I have to go back.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.560
~ You can't.
~ I must.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.150
It would be suicide.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.780
If you went back there now...

04:39.640 --> 04:42.510
.. you'd never get beyond the walls.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.430
Go to sleep, Pythagoras.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.470
We will come up with a plan.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.630
We will rescue her.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.680
Whatever we have to
do, we will do it.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.980
Are you all right?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.830
The sound of the birds
in the morning...

05:14.880 --> 05:17.550
always used to make me so happy.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.910
When I was alone they were all I had.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.990
You've got us now.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.710
You don't need to sit out here.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.310
You're going to get cold.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.830
I want to be out here.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.750
~ I'll get you a blanket.
~ No.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.590
You'll wake Hercules.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.400
Nothing wakes Hercules.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.720
Here.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.950
This is all my fault.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.790
Everyone who touches my life.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.440
I am cursed.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.640
~ You mustn't think that.
~ I cannot escape it.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.600
No matter what I try, what I do...

06:04.400 --> 06:06.200
.. I am damned.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.670
~ No.
~ Don't ever tell Hercules I said that.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.110
Never, ever.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.270
You must promise.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.520
Why?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.310
He loves you.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.560
He cares about you.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.900
I don't want him to feel my pain.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.830
~ They were all I could get.
~ Where is Delmos?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.990
~ What have they done to him?
~ I know nothing of his fate, Majesty.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.390
They tell me very little.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.870
And the people?

06:43.920 --> 06:48.070
Pasiphae is ruthless. Any that
dare to protest, she has slain.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.230
~ What of Jason?
~ He has not been seen.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.380
I have asked, but...
it seems he has fled.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.070
No. He would not do that.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.660
~ You must find him.
~ My Lady...

07:05.360 --> 07:07.790
Even speaking with you
I am risking everything.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.030
I'm begging you. For
the sake of Atlantis.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.180
How? I'm no more than
a common soldier.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.500
Are you going to let more men die?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.510
More women and children be enslaved?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.990
I know a place where he may be.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.360
In the mountains beyond the
city there is a hunting lodge.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.840
Jason took me there once
to meet my brother.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.310
Where's Medusa?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.870
Oh, they went out.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.520
In search of firewood, I think.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.510
~ Have you seen yourself?
~ I'm fine.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.470
You need food.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.550
No.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.870
Here.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.190
~ I've been saving this.
~ It's all right, I don't want it.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.990
You'll make yourself weak. You
won't be able to hold a sword,
you won't be able to fight.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.510
You see, where are your reactions?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.030
We'll need those when
we go to rescue Ariadne.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.310
Oh, again, too slow.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.550
Pasiphae's men would scythe you
down like a blade of grass.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.190
I think even Pythagoras
could knock you over.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.870
Come on!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.520
Hercules...

08:12.440 --> 08:13.980
I'm sorry.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.200
Just leave me.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.550
But... I-I want to help.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.200
You can't.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.230
When I lost Medusa...

08:34.799 --> 08:38.559
.. you were always telling
me, "Keep faith. Be strong."

08:40.600 --> 08:42.400
You were right.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.260
Still can't believe...

08:46.520 --> 08:49.590
To sleep with her in my arms again

08:49.640 --> 08:52.350
is more than anything
I could have dreamed of.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.310
You and Ariadne are destined
to be together.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.710
Like me, you will find
happiness, I believe that.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.070
But to win out you must endure.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.630
The gods will test your
courage and perseverance,

09:06.680 --> 09:08.790
and to face that

09:08.840 --> 09:11.640
you will need all of your strength.

09:12.520 --> 09:19.830
To save her, you may need to
tear down walls, mountains even,

09:19.880 --> 09:22.880
and you can't do it
feeling like that.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.310
Pythagoras?

09:39.360 --> 09:41.470
Ariadne sent me. You have to help us.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.230
Then she's alive.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.390
But I cannot say for how much longer.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.630
~ Who's she?!
~ It's all right!

09:48.680 --> 09:50.920
She's a friend.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.560
Do you know where Jason is?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.790
~ Yes.
~ Pasiphae is seeking to have
Ariadne renounce the throne.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.830
Ariadne is standing firm, but...

10:02.880 --> 10:05.750
who knows what Pasiphae
has in store for her?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.990
Torture and execution
are rife in the city.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.670
The Queen is relying on Jason.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.860
Her need is desperate.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.270
You must return to the Queen.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.190
You must do everything
you can to protect her.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.780
We will get the news to Jason.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.920
You know we can't tell him.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.470
Ariadne is in grave peril.
Jason needs to know.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.030
He will only do something rash.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.110
We can't just stand
by and do nothing.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.560
I'm not suggesting we ju...

10:39.880 --> 10:43.550
I think I know a way to get
Ariadne out of the city.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.230
But we cannot tell the others.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.350
~ Why?
~ Please, Pythagoras.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.470
You have to trust me.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.670
Where have you been?

10:53.720 --> 10:56.460
We were just collecting firewood.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.360
And we... came up with a plan.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.390
I'm going to return to Atlantis.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.950
Don't be stupid.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.710
We can't sit here forever. We have
to know if Ariadne is alive.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.910
Well, then I should go.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.110
No, they're looking for
you, and for Hercules.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.990
Pythagoras is the
only one who can go.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.950
They'll know he helped us escape.
I can't let you go. If they capture
you, they'll kill you.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.750
I have friends in the city. People I
can trust, people who can... help us.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.350
I won't stand by while you risk
your life for the woman I love.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.750
When the time is right you'll
have your part to play, but...

11:33.800 --> 11:37.200
.. we need to find out
what's happening first.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.630
He's right.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.030
Are you sure?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.910
Yes.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.100
There is no other way.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.830
How have they treated
you? Are you all right?

12:02.880 --> 12:04.230
Get me out of here.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.820
~ If I had any power...
~ Please!

12:07.680 --> 12:11.270
If you submit to the
Queen, you will be safe.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.640
I know your gifts bind
you to tell the truth...

12:15.880 --> 12:19.280
.. but you must learn
to put things carefully.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.110
And not be faithful to the gods?

12:23.160 --> 12:25.720
Is this what you ask of me?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.900
I wish it were not so.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.800
But I... have made a terrible
mistake, my child.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.960
I have brought this on us both.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.630
Oh, but I...

12:44.680 --> 12:48.870
You did what you did to keep me safe.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.520
The gods will know that, their
understanding is greater than ours.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.320
And they will not let what
has happened go unpunished.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.560
As a child, that was one of the
first lessons you taught me.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.560
Do not forget your own teachings...

13:09.880 --> 13:12.350
.. for they are wise indeed.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.110
Anything you can find out. And
try... if at all possible...

13:20.160 --> 13:22.360
to get word to Ariadne.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.160
Tell her that I love her,
and I will free her.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.030
And if you happen to
see a flagon of wine...

13:31.080 --> 13:34.470
Good idea. And perhaps...
a small pie?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.150
Don't do anything stupid.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.500
~ So, not the flagon of wine?
~ No, just the pie.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.360
Be strong. Don't be afraid.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.270
Delmos...

14:12.320 --> 14:14.510
You are not the one who
should have suffered.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.430
No matter what they do to me,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.230
you must promise...

14:18.280 --> 14:20.620
that you will not give in.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.200
Promise me.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.460
I promise.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.520
~ Pythagoras.
~ Daedalus. I need your help.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.080
Icarus.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.430
You were lucky.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.310
Pasiphae's men are out there
killing anyone on sight.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.710
The army have sided with her?

15:24.760 --> 15:27.070
Yes, well, they're
spineless recreants.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.910
They don't want to find themselves
hanging from their necks.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.110
Pythagoras got here.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.920
For a reason.

15:35.080 --> 15:38.180
I need to get into the
Temple of Poseidon.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.310
Are you totally insane?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.350
I would not do this if
there was any other way.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.630
The Priests are loyal to Pasiphae.
You'd be heading into a vipers' nest.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.430
Please, Daedalus.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.220
The fate of Atlantis is at stake.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.560
There is something I must retrieve.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.880
Really? What?

16:01.320 --> 16:04.600
Mm? What's so precious that
you would risk so much?

16:07.160 --> 16:09.000
Pandora's box.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.240
Oh, you...

16:16.840 --> 16:18.270
I see.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.790
~ Father...
~ No, no. I like it.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.350
You won't even get near the temple.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.510
The streets around there are guarded
day and night. It's impossible.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.550
Oh, how many times
have I told you, mm?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.670
There's no such word.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.190
~ Father?
~ Well, did you find out what I asked?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.510
Yes, Father, but... I'm worried.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.030
Oh, for the love of the gods, would you
please just tell me what I want to know?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.550
There's a group of lepers
due to seek Poseidon's cure.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.630
They gather at dusk.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.230
Mm-hm. Right. Perfect. Then
we'll... hide amongst them.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.910
~ There is a reason they are shunned.
~ Mm-hm.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.950
And the reason is ignorance.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.910
They are cursed. Being
near them is dangerous!

17:03.960 --> 17:05.700
Tchah! Piffle!

17:06.560 --> 17:10.390
I've known people be among
them and never be afflicted.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.589
Even if it works, and we
enter the temple grounds,

17:13.640 --> 17:15.030
there are soldiers everywhere.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.950
How will we get him into
the Inner Sanctum?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.200
I sometimes wonder if
you really are my son.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.550
It's obvious.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.630
What is that?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.350
It's a little invention of mine.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.470
Pray to the gods this works.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.990
Now, go! Go, go!

18:30.040 --> 18:31.790
What was that?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.830
I call it Fire Powder.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.980
Worked really much better
than I imagined.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.240
Pythagoras?

19:14.920 --> 19:18.350
~ Please...
~ Guards!
~ No, wait!

19:18.400 --> 19:20.510
Do you not realise
what you have done?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.830
Have you seen the people dying?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.150
Is that what you wanted?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.070
I beg you, Melas.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.120
This is our last hope
of saving the city.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.280
Follow me. There's a safer way.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.270
There was very little damage.
No-one was seriously hurt.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.710
I'm not interested in what
happened, I want to know why

19:57.760 --> 19:59.470
They sought to kill and maim!

19:59.520 --> 20:01.990
You cannot expect all
the people to be loyal,

20:02.040 --> 20:05.080
especially when you still do not
have the blessing of the gods.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.520
Hunt down the perpetrators and have
them strung up for all to see.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.830
You have been brave, Delmos.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.280
You have given me strength.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.420
Please do not give
up now. We will win.

20:25.360 --> 20:29.390
You've remained loyal to your
Queen and I will repay you.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
I'm loyal to you...

20:32.200 --> 20:35.270
.. not just because
you are my Queen...

20:35.320 --> 20:38.060
.. but because I believe in you...

20:38.320 --> 20:41.060
.. and the leader you have become.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.350
It seems like it will not be
long before he is in Hades.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.350
He has more strength than
you could possibly imagine.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.760
So...

20:59.680 --> 21:02.150
.. you've had time to think.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.110
Tell me, what is your decision?

21:04.160 --> 21:07.260
I will never renounce
my throne to you.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.750
I could have a physician help him.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.110
~ Oh, you think I'm a fool.
~ You think you're untouchable.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.270
You're not.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.190
It is not me who has
delusions about who I am.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.840
I am Queen of Atlantis.

21:20.840 --> 21:24.800
This land was bequeathed to me by my
father and I will never disown it!

21:27.560 --> 21:30.400
Give me your sword.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.160
Go ahead...

21:34.080 --> 21:35.430
.. kill me.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.470
Oh, no.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.670
It is not your own life you
are making judgment on.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.190
Hold him!

22:07.000 --> 22:08.670
I will not...

22:09.880 --> 22:11.620
.. bow to you.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.300
Not now...

22:15.960 --> 22:17.560
.. not ever.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.280
Defy me again...

22:36.120 --> 22:39.280
.. and you will be begging
for such a swift death.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.950
Thank you. I won't forget this.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.400
If there's anything else
you need, we're here.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.280
You got it?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.350
You do not have to
go through with this.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.270
It's what I want.

23:33.320 --> 23:36.070
Have you forgotten how you were?

23:36.120 --> 23:39.320
I do not intend to live
like that for long.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.780
Then...

23:45.160 --> 23:46.630
What are you saying?

23:46.680 --> 23:49.310
My life is decided.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.830
I beg once more, do
not tell Hercules.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.350
Or Jason.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.960
Do not make this any harder for me.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.670
Did you get word to Ariadne?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.320
How is she?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.390
She is alive.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.110
But others in the city
have not fared so well.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.590
Where is she?

24:23.640 --> 24:26.110
Pasiphae has her imprisoned.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.960
She is seeking to bend her will,
force her to renounce her throne.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.110
I have never seen such suffering.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.440
Pasiphae is too strong, no-one
can stand up to her.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.670
I do not know how much longer
Ariadne will hold out.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.190
Right, then we go back.
We have to rescue her.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.670
How, how? With what?!

24:48.720 --> 24:51.590
We don't have a plan,
not half a plan.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.120
To charge in there would be certain
death. Is that what you want?

25:07.560 --> 25:08.990
Do your worst.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.910
You will not succeed.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.230
You may change your mind.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.350
In Colchis...

25:25.400 --> 25:28.800
I once saw Medea use her
magic to break a man.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.510
It was like watching an
eagle on the battlefield

25:33.560 --> 25:36.600
draw out the contents of a
man's head though his eyes.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.510
So instinctive, so clever,

25:41.560 --> 25:43.100
so very...

25:44.640 --> 25:46.800
.. very... brutal.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.300
Let's see how strong you are now.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.390
~ Food.
~ Oh, I am ravenous...

26:43.440 --> 26:45.040
Stay there.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.710
I am truly the most
fortunate man alive.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.350
Can't eat with one hand.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.600
I'm sorry.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.390
Mmm. This is good.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.990
Your favourite.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.000
You not eating?

27:21.160 --> 27:22.790
Have a bit more.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.160
Why?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.080
Because I love you.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.270
I want you to remember that.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.400
Never forget it.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.040
I won't.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.620
I hope so.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.960
I hope you always remember.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.180
Why are you talking like that?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.200
Because...

27:49.200 --> 27:51.350
.. I know what your memory's like.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.510
I don't like it when
you talk like that.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.160
Don't worry.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.790
I'm going to be with you.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.740
Always.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.040
Forever.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.070
~ You promise?
~ Till eternity.

28:11.880 --> 28:12.910
Come here.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.960
I don't know why...

28:16.680 --> 28:18.150
I feel...

28:19.880 --> 28:21.680
It's all right.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.280
It's all right.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.860
You sleep.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.740
I'll hold you.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.480
Watch over you.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.720
Is it done?

29:04.840 --> 29:06.640
What's going on?

29:08.200 --> 29:11.350
There is only one way
we can save Ariadne.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.910
We could not risk Hercules finding
out, he would never allow it.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.560
Allow what?

29:16.480 --> 29:18.390
If I return to what I was...

29:18.440 --> 29:20.070
Medusa...

29:20.120 --> 29:22.830
It is the only way
to defeat Pasiphae!

29:22.880 --> 29:25.230
Use me as a weapon.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.510
~ No army can defend against my powers.
~ No.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.760
No, that... is madness.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.910
Are you forgetting the pain that
that curse brought upon you?

29:35.960 --> 29:40.000
~ You know, you're finally free of it.
~ I cannot live with what I have done!

29:41.120 --> 29:45.710
The curse I received for killing
the Oracle was not a physical one,

29:45.760 --> 29:48.100
but it is no less painful.

29:48.800 --> 29:53.550
The guilt gnaws on my mind,
it invades my every dream,

29:53.600 --> 29:55.670
strangles...

29:55.720 --> 29:58.060
.. my every chance of joy.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.200
I cannot go on.

30:03.680 --> 30:07.670
At least this way my death
can bring some good.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.990
All you need is my head.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.950
~ Wh...?
~ The rest of me will only slow you down.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.300
~ No. What are you saying!?
~ My mind is made up.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.160
Remember - never forget.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.740
Pythagoras. Say something.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.630
No. Medusa, stop.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.990
~ Stop!
~ No, there is a cave a
short distance from here.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.380
I will wait for you there.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.190
Pythagoras...

30:41.920 --> 30:44.110
Surely you're not going
along with this.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.910
Right. Hercules!

30:45.960 --> 30:49.310
Jason, I wish there was another
way but there is not.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.960
You are the only person
who is immune to her gaze.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.800
Only you can save Atlantis.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.240
Now...

32:08.240 --> 32:11.040
Ariadne...

32:13.840 --> 32:16.180
You have something to say?

32:16.600 --> 32:17.800
Hmm?

32:19.920 --> 32:21.320
Tell me.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.000
I... wish...

32:27.480 --> 32:30.520
.. for my people... to know...

32:31.640 --> 32:34.710
.. that I have come
to a final decision.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.630
One that I hope they can understand.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.920
I declare...

32:45.440 --> 32:48.600
.. that there is only one
true Queen of Atlantis...

32:51.600 --> 32:53.670
.. and it is not you.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.720
It's all right.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.120
We'll start again tomorrow.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.720
It's only a matter of time.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.190
I wasn't sure if you would come.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.260
~ Medusa...
~ It is too late to dissuade me.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.830
I'm...

33:43.880 --> 33:46.020
begging you, please...

33:46.760 --> 33:48.700
.. do this for me.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.140
For all of us.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.310
Fell asleep.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.520
Where's Medusa, Jason?

34:36.840 --> 34:38.550
Hercules...

34:38.600 --> 34:40.199
What is it?

34:41.239 --> 34:43.040
Listen to me...

34:44.400 --> 34:46.310
What's happened?

34:46.360 --> 34:49.350
It's Medusa, isn't it? Tell
me. Tell me it isn't her.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.940
I'm sorry.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.739
What has happened?

34:58.880 --> 35:01.680
She took her life to save Atlantis.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.830
She... She would not do that.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.990
She could not escape what
she had done, her guilt.

35:10.040 --> 35:13.430
~ No!
~ She... She wanted to tell you, Hercules.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.710
She's not dead. Where is she?
Where's the body? Show me!

35:16.760 --> 35:19.110
She chose to die, but not in vain.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.800
She knew that there was only one
way to defeat Pasiphae's army.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.060
I retrieved Pandora's box.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.560
~ What have you done to her?!
~ It's too late. She's gone! I'm sorry!

36:00.360 --> 36:01.960
Who's there?

36:03.040 --> 36:05.110
Stand and answer me.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.510
Halt!

36:11.560 --> 36:13.720
Stop where you are.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.430
My Lady! We are under attack.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.430
~ From who?!
~ Jason.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.670
~ Kill him.
~ We cannot.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.420
He carries with him the severed
head of the Gorgon.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.640
Keep all others at bay.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.900
I will deal with this myself.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.760
Very clever.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.620
But it won't work.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.830
I am immune to the Gorgon's gaze.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.950
It will not kill me.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.360
No.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.720
I will.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.590
You will not kill me.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.240
I wouldn't be so sure.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.630
Then why do you hesitate?

38:44.680 --> 38:45.920
Hmm?

38:47.320 --> 38:49.260
I'll tell you why.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.150
Because I am your mother.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.950
Is this true?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
She is your mother.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.950
That is why you cannot kill her.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.430
You're different, Jason.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.670
You, like her, are
touched by the gods.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.550
You understand now...

40:18.600 --> 40:22.000
why you are better with
a sword than any other.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.760
And why you can look at the Gorgon
without turning to stone.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.000
Now you know the truth, you can
embrace who you really are.

40:33.800 --> 40:37.200
That is why we feel this
way about each other.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.080
I don't feel anything
but hatred for you.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.670
~ Jason... How did you get here?
~ I can't explain.

41:22.720 --> 41:26.270
We need to move fast. Use
this to cover your eyes.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.720
Whatever you do, for your own
safety, do not take it off.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.240
Do you trust me?

41:35.400 --> 41:37.140
You know I do.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.860
It is as the Oracle foretold.

42:03.360 --> 42:07.060
Now that Jason knows the
truth about his mother...

42:07.240 --> 42:09.580
.. his heart is blackened.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.720
Jason!
