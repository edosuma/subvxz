AIDAN: Five, four,
three, two, one!

00:23.600 --> 00:26.033
Look at her go!

00:26.100 --> 00:27.867
Just like the real
Thunderbird 3.

00:27.933 --> 00:31.900
(LAUGHS) I guess so, son.
You're the expert on
International Rescue.

00:31.967 --> 00:34.633
Yeah. I searched
every picture there is,

00:34.700 --> 00:38.233
but I still don't get
how the pilot sits in it.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.900
Come on, Aidan. It's late.
Last rescue for the day.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.300
Oh.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.400
Whoa! What's that, Dad?

01:02.467 --> 01:04.633
That's a sonic
injection platform.

01:06.267 --> 01:12.500
See, energy poachers use
these to steal hydro methane
from underground.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.367
Right. We need to work out
how to turn it off.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.333
Careful.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.633
(SIGHS) It must be
fully automated.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.067
I'd better call this in.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.833
Er, Aidan, do you see
a comm switch?

01:34.900 --> 01:35.800
-Here it is.
-(BEEPS)

01:35.867 --> 01:37.267
-Thanks.
-(CRACKLING)

Hello. My name is

01:42.333 --> 01:44.600
I'm the warden of
Dunsley Fields.

01:44.667 --> 01:48.500
Now, I've just discovered
an illegal hydro methane
extractor.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.067
-Can you hold, please?
-Yeah, I'll hold.

01:51.133 --> 01:53.367
(CLUNKING AND WHIRRING)

01:55.267 --> 01:57.767
The actuator!
It's starting to pump!

02:00.900 --> 02:04.067
-Whoa! The ground's
giving way!
-Oh!

02:04.067 --> 02:05.400
We have to get out of here!

03:09.267 --> 03:11.333
I'm the warden
of Dunsley Fields.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.933
Now, I've just discovered
an illegal hydro methane
extractor.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.400
Yeah, I'll hold.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.567
That's all there is, guys.
Kinda weird.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.467
That's setting the bar a
little low for weird, John.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.733
This Williams guy
was reporting some
shady goings-on,

03:24.800 --> 03:26.867
got put on hold,
lost his nerve, and hung up.

03:26.933 --> 03:30.467
Gordon, the call came on
an ID blank comm from
Dunsley Fields

03:30.533 --> 03:32.467
right before we detected
an earthquake.

03:32.533 --> 03:34.200
So the comm belonged
to the bad guys?

03:34.267 --> 03:36.067
Okay, it's a little weird.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.400
Check out these satellite
pics. What do you make
of it, Brains?

03:38.467 --> 03:41.767
It appears to be
a sonic injection platform.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.667
And not a particularly
well-engineered one, at that.

03:44.733 --> 03:47.633
Right, Brains.
But just a minute later
it looked like this.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.067
The control section's
sheared clean off.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.133
So, some greedy crooks
left a machine to
suck up hydro methane

03:53.200 --> 03:55.967
and now it's trashed.
Looks like the problem
took care of itself.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.833
Not necessarily, Virgil.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.367
The call likely came
from the control section.

04:00.433 --> 04:02.300
And if Mr. Williams
was inside...

04:02.367 --> 04:05.200
Exactly.
We may have a situation.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.267
-Dad!
-Oh, I'm... I'm all right.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.433
(CHUCKLES) That was
a bit of a fall, wasn't it?

04:16.500 --> 04:18.700
(STIFLED GROAN)

04:20.067 --> 04:22.467
-Oh... Watch out.
-(STRAINING)

04:35.600 --> 04:38.367
-Dad?
-There's something
on top of us.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.433
Maybe loose boulders.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.067
Or the rest of the platform.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.167
-See if the comm works.
-Okay.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.400
Mayday! Mayday!

04:50.433 --> 04:51.733
No answer.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.067
Uh-oh.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.967
I've run through dozens of
reports about these machines.

05:03.067 --> 05:06.367
Turns out the hydro methane
gas energy poachers
extract with them

05:06.433 --> 05:08.433
is worth a fortune
on the black market.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.600
And scans show that ocean
water has started flooding
into the caverns below.

05:12.667 --> 05:16.400
Any more of this, and
Dunsley Fields could
become a huge sinkhole.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.867
That wasn't an earthquake
we detected. It was a cave-in.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.767
Okay, I'll fly over with
Gordon and see what
we can see.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.067
(BEEPS)

05:24.133 --> 05:26.733

you're going, Max?

06:49.300 --> 06:51.400
It's just a shame you had
to use part of your rocket.

at this thing.

is still active.

-You need to shut it down.
-Agreed.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.467
But first things first.
We need to look for survivors.

07:52.933 --> 07:56.300
VIRGIL: Wherever that control
section is, it's buried now.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.433

flooded caverns.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.200
If you can find a way in,

08:00.267 --> 08:02.600
the most direct route
would be to go underwater.

the most direct way in,

09:31.067 --> 09:34.133
then that control section
must be on the other side
of the world.

I disable the actuator.

-Not from the control section.

down that machine from up top.

11:36.433 --> 11:39.700
Is it sitting on the
hydro methane tanks?

11:39.767 --> 11:43.767
Correct. A failed attempt
to disable the actuator

11:43.833 --> 11:47.067
could vaporize
the whole area.

Can you tell me anything
about where you are?

11:51.300 --> 11:54.200
-I can hear water below us.
-Good. That helps.

till I get there.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.667
Argh! Dead end.

12:25.733 --> 12:29.733
So, Aidan, why don't you
tell me about how you put
together this radio of yours.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.767

he's my best friend,

12:32.833 --> 12:34.833
we're crazy about aerospace.

12:34.900 --> 12:38.533
We even found a picture of
Thunderbird 3 on the Net.
And I built a scale model.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.567
GORDON: So much for
keeping that one secret.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.300
AIDAN: So, the telemetry relay
of my Thunderbird

12:42.367 --> 12:43.900
is what
I made the radio out of.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.667
GORDON: Nice one. Argh!
AIDAN: Are you almost here?

12:46.733 --> 12:51.233
Yes! Well, I'll be straight
with you. It's slow going.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.267
It's gonna be
all right, Aidan.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.267
Okay. Standing by.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.700
Great. The actuator
runs on solar power.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.400
It's covered front to back
with energy collection panels.

13:03.467 --> 13:06.767
That means there isn't any way
to shut it down.

13:06.833 --> 13:09.367
It could start another cave-in
at any moment!

13:09.433 --> 13:12.200
VIRGIL: Can't cut the power,
can't blow it up.

13:12.267 --> 13:13.667
Looks like we'll
have to move it.

13:13.733 --> 13:16.867

sonic injection platform?

13:16.933 --> 13:20.067
Why, of course!
Why didn't I think of that?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.733
'Cause nobody
but me can do it.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.633
Brains, this is Aidan.
He's pretty handy.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.867
He built a radio from
a model rocket's
telemetry relay.

What a resourceful boy!

13:52.167 --> 13:57.633
-Aidan, do you know
what sonar is?
-Sure. Want me to ping you?

13:57.700 --> 14:00.133
Yes. That would
be quite helpful.

locator transponder
still works.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.067
F.A.B.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.767
Thunderbird 2,
how's everything top side?

15:01.833 --> 15:03.700
VIRGIL: Not so great.

15:03.767 --> 15:07.100
I may have a little problem
with my brilliant plan.

15:08.567 --> 15:11.267
The platform is too big
for Thunderbird 2 to move.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.433
I'm gonna have to cut
this thing down to size.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.533
-(RUMBLING)
-Hey! Whoa!

15:28.533 --> 15:29.567
Whoa!

15:30.567 --> 15:31.967
(BEEPING)

15:32.067 --> 15:33.533
-(RUMBLING)
-(THUD)

15:33.600 --> 15:35.567
(MOANS) Dad!

15:35.633 --> 15:36.767
Ahhh!

15:36.833 --> 15:40.167
It's like being inside
a rock crusher! (GRUNTING)

15:40.233 --> 15:43.333
-BRAINS: Has it stopped?
-Feels like it.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.733
You were right about
the hydro methane.

15:47.067 --> 15:48.200
It's everywhere.

15:48.267 --> 15:51.633
Try not to ignite it.
If it blows up...

15:51.700 --> 15:53.767
It'll be like
the Fourth of July?

15:53.833 --> 15:55.667
More like doomsday.

15:55.733 --> 15:57.133
Good to know.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.600
Looks like I've got
some climbing to do.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.367
(GRUNTING)

16:12.500 --> 16:14.600
Almost there.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.567
-Good. My dad's looking bad.
-(GROANS)

16:17.633 --> 16:19.267
Just hang on.

16:19.333 --> 16:23.167
-Aidan, you know what I hate?
-What?

16:23.233 --> 16:24.900
-Low ceilings.
-(LAUGHS)

16:24.967 --> 16:26.067
(CREAKING)

16:26.067 --> 16:27.067
We'll be out of here

16:27.133 --> 16:28.400
before it gets any lower.

16:28.467 --> 16:31.267
If it gets any lower,
we'll have to wear it home.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.400
(BOTH CHUCKLE NERVOUSLY)

16:33.467 --> 16:35.100
(RATTLING)

16:36.200 --> 16:37.533
(THUDDING)

16:38.700 --> 16:39.833
(GRUNTS)

16:39.900 --> 16:42.333
GORDON: Virgil, that rig's
gotta move soon.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.800
The control section can't take
another cave-in.

16:45.967 --> 16:47.233
F.A.B.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.267
(RATTLING)

17:02.600 --> 17:04.067
(GRUNTS)

17:05.067 --> 17:06.433
(STRAINS)

17:07.067 --> 17:08.633
(CLATTERING)

17:10.933 --> 17:12.800
-Aidan!
-International Rescue!

17:12.867 --> 17:15.600
Hi. It's Gordon.
Time to get you out of here.

17:15.667 --> 17:20.167
-It's good to see you.
(GROANS)
-Take it easy.

17:20.233 --> 17:23.567
Okay, we're gonna need to
lower him on my cable.
I need two lengths of rope...

17:23.633 --> 17:25.500
One three meters,
the other four.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.233
For an improvised
rescue harness.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.167
-Nice!
-I already found some stuff.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.800
-It's over there.
-I'll get it on him.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.633
Keep him comfortable
and hydrated. Small sips.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.633
VIRGIL: Gordo,
you better be gone.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.800
(MR. WILLIAMS GROANING)

17:44.900 --> 17:46.367
(RUMBLING)

17:48.367 --> 17:51.533
No! It's another earthquake.
(GASPS)

17:51.600 --> 17:53.067
(HOLDS BREATH)

17:53.067 --> 17:55.500
Aidan, first rule
in any emergency?

17:55.567 --> 17:58.400
-Stay calm.
-(GRUNTS)

17:58.467 --> 18:00.200
(GROANS)

18:06.867 --> 18:09.733
Don't worry, Aidan.
Just take it steady.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.233
(AIDAN GRUNTING)

18:16.800 --> 18:18.367
(RUMBLING)

18:20.633 --> 18:22.500
The actuator's clear.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.300
Let's move this thing!

18:41.967 --> 18:43.733
-Whoa!
-AIDAN: Gordon!

18:49.700 --> 18:51.467
(GASPING)

18:51.533 --> 18:54.267
That last quake weakened
the rock. Move!

19:16.067 --> 19:19.133
-(METAL STRAINING)
-(GRUNTS)

19:32.967 --> 19:35.067
-Perfect timing.
-(ALARMS BEEPING)

19:35.133 --> 19:37.167
Maybe not so perfect.

19:40.233 --> 19:43.367
VIRGIL: Thunderbird 4,
that actuator must have
regulated the pressure

19:43.433 --> 19:45.367
on the hydromethane tank.

19:46.233 --> 19:47.733
It's gonna blow!

19:50.067 --> 19:51.733
(GRUNTING)

19:51.800 --> 19:53.767
-Belts on!
-Cool!

20:08.800 --> 20:10.300
GORDON:
We're not out of it yet.

20:10.367 --> 20:13.233
Virgil, no need to cut it
close or anything.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.300
VIRGIL: I got you.
Brace yourselves!

20:42.567 --> 20:44.000
You're going to be
all right, Dad.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.933
Yeah. Well done, son.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.900
There's a hospital just
10 minutes away.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.467
We'll get that leg
set for you.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.033
JOHN: Thunderbird 4, this is
Thunderbird 5. Great rescue.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.867
-We made it. But whoever's
behind this got away clean.
-Not quite.

20:55.933 --> 20:59.200
I've been monitored the
frequency that Mr. Williams's
call came in on

20:59.267 --> 21:01.533
and found a crew
of hydro methane poachers

21:01.600 --> 21:04.967
trying to transmit
new instructions to
that injection platform.

21:05.067 --> 21:08.167
-The local authorities are
rounding them up right now.
-Johnny!

21:08.233 --> 21:10.533
Did you just bust
a crime ring from orbit?

21:10.600 --> 21:13.100
Well, Brains helped.
And don't call me Johnny.

21:13.167 --> 21:16.133
Damon's gonna be
so jealous I've got
to meet you guys!

21:16.200 --> 21:18.400
Too bad it's 'cause
I needed saving.

21:18.467 --> 21:21.267
You never want something bad
to happen to your dad.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.067
-No.
-You sure don't.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.833
BRAINS: If our guests
would prefer,

21:25.900 --> 21:29.900
we have very good medical
facilities on Tracy Island.

21:29.967 --> 21:33.600
Perhaps this brilliant
young man would like
a tour of my lab.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.533
-F.A.B.!
-F.A.B.!

21:36.600 --> 21:38.667
-What does that mean?
-(AIDAN LAUGHS)

21:38.733 --> 21:41.900
-(LAUGHTER)
-What? I'd really
like to know.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.700
-Dad!
-Always wondered.
