00:14.723 --> 00:16.558
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.352
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.562
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.105
Walk with me.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.650
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:25.734 --> 00:29.529
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:29.612 --> 00:32.323
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.992
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.536
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:36.619 --> 00:37.495
I don't care.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.997
Look at my birds.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.709
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.792 --> 00:46.254
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.673
I got land, I got animals,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.468
and best of all I have this.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.970
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.892
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.936
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.854 --> 01:06.232
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:06.316 --> 01:08.026
"Bag"? We can just--

01:08.109 --> 01:10.445
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.781
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.864 --> 01:16.076
So I got a call to be on a TV show
'cause I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.078
I said, "Sure, cool." Why not, right?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.287
So I agreed.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.956
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
<i>-Hi!</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.504
What do you want?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.380
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:35.053
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.556
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.474
Say hi, guys.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.391
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:40.475 --> 01:43.561
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.772
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.732
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.443
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.403
This is Graz.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.447
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.782
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.369
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.453
Let's have fun.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.334
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.170
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains can come up with.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.175
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not--

02:19.305 --> 02:20.265
Next!

02:20.348 --> 02:21.516
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:23.143
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
-Some builds will be good.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.855
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
Are you not entertained?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Some builds will be bad.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.443
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Make a bigger handle!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.864
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.907
-Yeah!
<i>-That is disgusting.</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Whoa!

02:41.411 --> 02:44.622
-<i>I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.875
-Go, Graz!

02:46.958 --> 02:49.878
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.800 --> 02:58.803
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
You're onto something there.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.681
…it can be built.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.017
<i>Oh!</i>

03:04.100 --> 03:05.685
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
Hey, it might even
inspire them to build

03:07.854 --> 03:09.939
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.816
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.571
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.781
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work!</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:20.909
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.204
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.163
Whatever.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.802
Graz, what's with the jumpsuit?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.639
-What do you mean?
-You look like a janitor in a prison.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.516
What's wrong with my jumpsuit?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.185
Looks like the guy at the carwash.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.774
You got him!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.984
I can pull it off.
I think I look pretty studly.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.656
Let's not get crazy. All right.
Let's hear some pitches. You ready?

03:59.739 --> 04:00.740
-Let's do it.
-Finally!

04:00.823 --> 04:02.784
Let's get ready. Let's see what we got.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.578
Hello? Can you hear me?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.288
-<i>Yes.</i>
-And what are your names?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.332
<i>Ian, and this is Angela.</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.251
-Are you guys lawyers?
<i>No.</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:13.670
<i>-We don't have a job.</i>

04:13.753 --> 04:16.798
-What's up, buddy? What's your name?
<i>-My name is Jacob.</i>

04:16.881 --> 04:18.841
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.802
<i>Video game programmer.</i>

04:20.885 --> 04:22.845
That's gonna be a tricky path.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.139
-It certainly is.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.267
-Hello!
<i>-Hi, Jimmy.</i>

04:27.350 --> 04:29.852
Hey, guys. Do you guys have
some inventions you wanna show us?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.605
<i>A stink bomb car.</i>

04:32.689 --> 04:33.523
Oh!

04:33.606 --> 04:35.400
-What did he say?
A stink bomb car.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.236
<i>It shoots stink bombs and goes…</i>

04:38.319 --> 04:40.280
-I love it.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.323
Eva, what do you think about the car?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.617
<i>-It stinks.</i>

04:44.701 --> 04:46.828
<i>It smells like my dad.</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:50.665
Give me something good.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.667
<i>This is the Magna Suit.</i>

04:52.750 --> 04:55.336
<i>The bottoms of the boots</i>
<i>are positively charged.</i>

04:55.420 --> 04:58.631
-Okay.
<i>-The floor has electromagnets underneath.</i>

04:58.715 --> 05:00.758
-Okay.
-<i>When you step into the room,</i>

05:00.842 --> 05:02.218
<i>you're pretty much floating.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:04.220
I think you're too smart for me.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.139
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

05:06.222 --> 05:08.599
-Give me your elevator pitch.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.059
Ready? Bing.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.146
<i>So we invented a flying house</i>

05:13.229 --> 05:16.899
<i>that has a helicopter on it,</i>
<i>and when you press the red button, bing,</i>

05:16.983 --> 05:20.611
<i>it just carries the house,</i>
<i>and it can go anywhere you want it to go.</i>

05:20.695 --> 05:22.655
<i>It can go to Disneyland, Legoland.</i>

05:22.739 --> 05:26.617
<i>And the most important part is that</i>
<i>it can go to our friends' house, and the--</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:28.745
-I'm almost at my floor.
<i>-Pardon?</i>

05:28.828 --> 05:32.248
Sometimes when I hear a great idea,
I can't contain my excitement.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.584
<i>-Yes!</i>
-This is not one of those times.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.796
<i>If you think you can't do it,</i>
<i>it's not my problem. It's your problem.</i>

05:40.381 --> 05:41.758
-Next.
<i>-What?</i>

05:42.425 --> 05:44.635
-Wanna see a magic trick?
<i>-What is it?</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:47.764
-Abracadabra. Poof! You're gone.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.557
Jacob, do you know what your IQ is?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.851
<i>-No?</i>
-Because mine is six.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.188
<i>Guys, I'm too smart for you.</i>

05:59.275 --> 06:00.568
That's perfect.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.278
I think that's a first for the show.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.488
And I don't feel bad--

06:03.571 --> 06:05.990
-It's a blessing in disguise.
-He was way above us.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.493
-Oh my God.
-Super funny and super smart.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.788
What's up, guys?
What's your names?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.873
<i>Christopher Whitley.</i>

06:13.956 --> 06:15.375
<i>Malia Whitley.</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:17.710
And are you guys a brother and sister?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-We're twins.</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:23.132
Okay. Who's older?
Somebody has to be older. Who's older?

06:23.216 --> 06:26.219
<i>-Me! Me! Me! I'm older!</i>
<i>-No! I'm older! I'm older! No!</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:27.804
-Next.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.973
-Easy!
-Break her--

06:31.057 --> 06:32.642
-Oh boy.
-Reel it in.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.727
<i>Yeah. I'm smacking his brain out.</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:35.853
All right, guys.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.357
If you could take about three seconds
to stop fighting, tell me your idea.

06:40.691 --> 06:46.280
Scissors, rock and finally paper,
built in scissors and rock and paper.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.282
<i>I want Rock-paper-scissors.</i>

06:48.366 --> 06:51.202
-We're gonna play Rock-paper-scissor?
<i>-Yes.</i>

06:51.285 --> 06:55.331
<i>The hand as large as this big table.</i>

06:55.415 --> 06:56.749
So like a big hand.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.587
<i>Yes. And then the paper</i>
<i>is some really big toilet paper.</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:04.507
-Okay.
<i>-And the rock is as big as a glacier,</i>

07:04.590 --> 07:07.844
<i>and the scissors</i>
<i>is as big as a shark's mouth.</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:11.764
All right. So let me get this straight.
You want a big hand.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.725
We'd have to have two hands if they were
gonna play against each other.

07:14.809 --> 07:18.479
So we have two big scissors,
and we have two big pieces of paper,

07:18.563 --> 07:20.606
and we have two big rocks,

07:20.690 --> 07:23.734
and then you turn around, and you set
the hand up, and then you go, boom.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.735
-Like that?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

07:24.819 --> 07:27.488
-Pretty good.
-Can you play Rock-paper-scissors?

07:27.572 --> 07:31.367
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
-The best 20 out of 21. Okay? Go.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.579
What do you think of this idea?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.789
It's a little crazy,
but it's the best one so far.

07:36.873 --> 07:37.999
<i>Got you!</i>

07:38.082 --> 07:40.001
-I like it.
It'd be a fun competition.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.544
-Yeah.
-<i> I won again!</i>

07:41.627 --> 07:45.339
-We could do like a curtain, where "choo."
-Pull a lever and it…

07:45.965 --> 07:49.302
<i>Wait. I win that round</i>
<i>because I pulled out the rock!</i>

07:49.385 --> 07:51.220
Sugar, the breakfast of champions.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.430
I think this is a good one.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.806
Yeah. This could be fun.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.142
No magnetism, no programming.
This is simple.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.686
We could play it. I think it's a good one.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.230
I think we do it
so that nobody kills each other.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.691
-Guys, we're gonna do your idea.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.067
<i>Yay!</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:07.445
We're gonna check in with you later
once we get started.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.740
Please, please, don't hurt each other
in the meantime. Okay?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.241
Ow!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.284
Bye.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.120
-I don't want childrens anymore.
-Yeah.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.123
-Wow.
-Could you imagine being in that house?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.958
-A lot of energy.
-Lots of energy.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.585
All right. I have some ideas.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.004
Let's go to the chalkboard
and start sketching up some ideas.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.088
Oh, thank God.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.638
Okay. So this is Rock-paper-scissor.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.974
So we need a rock,
and the kid said something

08:37.058 --> 08:39.185
about toilet paper,
which actually kind of is funny.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.562
-I like that.
-Kids like poop.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.190
And then, of course, we need scissors,

08:44.982 --> 08:47.193
which are gonna be
clumsy and silly-looking.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.195
I was thinking of a mechanism like this,

08:49.278 --> 08:52.323
maybe we have two of them,
and it goes to a lever.

08:52.823 --> 08:57.078
And then on here, you have a big hand.
And then this thing goes like this. Yoink!

08:57.578 --> 09:00.873
The weight of it dropping it,
or spring-loaded? What are you thinking?

09:00.957 --> 09:01.832
Yoink!

09:02.333 --> 09:03.167
Thanks.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.548
How's this gonna go? We're gonna
battle it out? Each have teams here?

09:08.631 --> 09:11.467
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
We'll build it as a team,

09:11.551 --> 09:14.262
and then in the end,
we'll figure out a way to choose teams.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.806
-How are we gonna do that?
-Rock-paper-scissors.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.723
Brilliant.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.268
But then we need a curtain

09:20.351 --> 09:23.104
in front of each,
so you won't know who's choosing what.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.313
Okay. This is gonna get good.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.983
Obviously, we're gonna
have to each have our own set.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.652
Your own pair of scissors, your own paper.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.738
Each of those will have to have
a bar or something attached to it

09:32.822 --> 09:35.491
that will fit into a sheath
in the palm of the hand.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.910
That way, all the parts
can be interchangeable.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.996
Are you two guys okay
to make the scissors and rock?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.372
-Hell yeah.
-All right.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.749
Jackman, you're good
at building big things,

09:43.833 --> 09:47.670
so maybe we make the big roll
of toilet paper out of foam rubber.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.007
Derek and I are gonna work
on the mechanisms and the big hands.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.633
The difficult stuff, we'll do.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.885
What time do you need
to get back to the maintenance job?

09:56.762 --> 10:00.266
We're good. Let's get out of here,
get started, and get some materials.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.977
-Let's go.
-Graz. Could you get my car washed?

10:05.730 --> 10:06.731
Very funny.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.150
What's your favorite part
of Rock-paper-scissors?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.694
Maybe rock.
It can smash everything.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.974
-What are you thinking here?
-It's a fairly simple mechanism.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.978
We have a lever, and the big pivot
that's going to carry the hand.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.564
-I can demonstrate my idea with a model.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.651
It's so much easier when you model
things up to see how they work.

10:52.234 --> 10:56.030
Making a small-scale model
is a very important part of my process.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.408
It helps me intimately understand
how the mechanics will work.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.743
Looks like a llama.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.246
So I know exactly what to do
when we scale up for the big build.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.539
It's gonna work so good.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.755
I'm gonna go over to the band saw
and make the hand.

11:13.964 --> 11:17.301
Let me explain how this works
because it's actually pretty simple.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.345
It's representational right now.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.514
The main mechanism is a system

11:21.597 --> 11:24.600
constructed of two levers
that are connected to each other.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.562
Each arm on its own pivot point,
called the fulcrum,

11:28.646 --> 11:32.233
will help to transfer the force
from our hand, to the big, giant hand.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.444
I see the top of the hand, like,
in this position right here.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.196
When we push the shorter lever,

11:37.279 --> 11:40.574
not only does it reduce the amount
of force we need to move the big hand,

11:40.658 --> 11:45.621
but the long lever amplifies the movement
to give it an even larger articulation.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.956
Look at that bicep.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.749
And just for funsies,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.502
I'm gonna add another pivot point
to the bottom lever

11:51.585 --> 11:54.547
to give us some additional movement
when the hand is thrown.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.924
Like I said, "Boink! Pretty simple."

11:57.883 --> 12:00.428
-I think it works well.
-I really like the extra pivot.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.721
Rock-paper-scissors.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.556
Oooh, yah!

12:04.640 --> 12:05.766
Oooh, yah!

12:07.852 --> 12:10.187
Are you sure Rochambeau
isn't French?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.149
You know what?
I don't even know what a Rochambeau is.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.234
It's Rock-paper-scissors, but I--

12:17.570 --> 12:19.822
I think I just Rochambeau'd in my shorts.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.991
All right. So we got some material.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.369
We got the paper.
We got the canvas. We got some tape.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.621
-Let's make some rocks.
-Let's do some rocks.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.126
The first step of rock-making is
to crumple a bunch of paper around a 2x4,

12:32.209 --> 12:35.671
to create a rocky shape
with a little bit of structure.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.758
-That's a good start.
-Rip that.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.095
Let's tape this
and kinda see where we're at.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.221
Hold on.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.307
Jimmy's got a lot
of cool tools laying around,

12:46.390 --> 12:49.727
but sometimes you just wanna
reach for the old school roll of tape.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.730
Tape is super easy
'cause you can just-- Agh!

12:52.813 --> 12:54.815
-I hate when that happens with the tape.
-Yeah.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.692
There we go. All right.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
Like I was saying, tape is easy to--

12:58.736 --> 13:00.905
Oh God, it's the worst.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.323
I got it. I got it.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.746
See? Super easy.

13:09.872 --> 13:15.044
Now that this is done,
step two is to get some canvas.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.463
To attach this to this,
what do you suggest?

13:17.546 --> 13:19.590
-Spray glue.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.926
All right. Let's start spraying.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.677
With just a little bit of spray glue…

13:24.678 --> 13:26.514
…we'll attach these strips of canvas

13:26.597 --> 13:28.808
around the rock
to give it a rugged exterior.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.392
Oh, that looks like a rock.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.602
With each extra strip…

13:31.685 --> 13:32.728
Nice.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.605
…we're getting close to being done.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.398
All right. Let's get another strip.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.234
I can almost taste it.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.777
I actually can taste it.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.696
It's good.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.574
-It's not toxic at all.
-Oh no, it's very toxic.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.128
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna make a hand out of this--

14:00.130 --> 14:02.800
-We're gonna cut individual fingers.
-Okay.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.010
And we'll create a gesture in them

14:05.094 --> 14:07.137
that works for what we're doing here.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.931
We have our first knuckle.

14:09.431 --> 14:13.936
To make a complete hand, I'm gonna
draw out all of the pieces of the hand.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.815
Fingertips, the palm, you get it.
And then we're gonna cut them out.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.900
And then for the big, big finger…

14:19.984 --> 14:20.818
This finger.

14:20.901 --> 14:21.944
Whoa.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.238
We're gonna have to draw
a big one for this one.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.117
Please. Family show.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.244
Grab that side.
We'll go over to the band saw.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.708
Making the whole hand in little pieces
is a lot easier and a lot safer.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.752
This way, if I have an accident,
I can just replace that one part

14:38.836 --> 14:41.422
instead of ruining a big,
giant chunk of foam.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.133
-What do you think? Good?
-Yeah, that should work.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.307
Foam is the way to go,
as far as materials go,

14:51.390 --> 14:55.769
because we can make the hands really big
but still stay relatively light.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.813
That's a little foreshadowing for you.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.277
Stick around and find out
if it is the case.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.364
Anyway, now that the fingers are cut,

15:07.448 --> 15:09.658
we're using spray-foam adhesive and screws

15:09.742 --> 15:11.869
to secure the fingers to the palm.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.788
Just kidding.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.459
The hands need a bit more
smoothing and shaping,

15:18.542 --> 15:21.337
and Derek is opting
for a fine sanding approach

15:21.420 --> 15:23.047
that will get the job done,

15:23.130 --> 15:25.758
but it's a little too slow for my taste.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.552
I prefer to take a quicker route.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.821
I've never done it before, but
I feel like I'd make a good ice sculptor.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.324
I mean, come on. Look at these things.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.633
It's beautiful.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.136
So I got the crappy job.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.097
I get to make
a giant roll of toilet paper.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.933
I gotta scale this up
until it's three feet in diameter.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.310
To do that, I've got a couple
of tube options here,

16:18.394 --> 16:21.981
some foam that's gonna wrap around that,
and then plywood for structure.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.148
Let's get started.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.400
This may come as a surprise,

16:24.483 --> 16:27.987
but I've never made
a giant roll of toilet paper before.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.489
So I'm gonna start with the basics.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.450
I'll start by cutting some
perfect circles out of plywood.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.662
These will go on either side
of the tube to provide structural support.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.127
The band saw
makes cutting circles easy,

16:43.210 --> 16:45.671
and although I know my way
around this particular tool,

16:45.754 --> 16:47.923
it's always nice to get a bit of coaching.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.341
Cut it from the waist.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.677
Use your whole body.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.097
That's it. Not the arms, the whole body.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.433
Whole body, Jackman, whole body.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.983
That's good, I guess.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.994
This is chicken wire that I'm wrapping
this giant roll of toilet paper in.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.079
This is gonna be the outside skin.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.373
On top of it
we're gonna do some quilted fabric.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.382
So the fabric part
of the rolls is all done.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.800
The next step is the ends.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.261
I'm gonna use this
to spiral around the sonotube

17:34.344 --> 17:37.014
and that's gonna
mimic the end of a toilet paper roll.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.650
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Yeah?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.152
Toilet paper's all done.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.821
It looks great. Looks just like
a real roll of toilet paper.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.991
That's really nice. You got
the double-ply quilted. It looks good.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.242
It's the good stuff.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.957
These rocks really did
come out pretty awesome.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.959
Dude, they look real.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.045
With the rocks all painted in plaster…

18:08.128 --> 18:09.713
Oh, this is coming out killer.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.883
…we might as well move on to the scissors
while the plaster dries and hardens.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.808
Scissor.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.018
-<i>Half</i> of a scissor.
-Half a scissor.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.233
All right. So here's the template
we cut on the band saw.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.527
-Yeah.
-So now it's plasma cutting.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.112
We're going to use this template

18:33.195 --> 18:37.032
to run the plasma gun
around the entire outline,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.909
and then we cut another one.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.580
And once we have that,
we'll actually have a scissor mechanism.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.667
-All right.
-Let's go.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.719
When the compressed air
in the plasma gun makes contact

18:57.803 --> 18:59.638
with the electrode, it ionizes.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.682
-You having fun?
-Oh yeah!

19:01.765 --> 19:03.976
Resulting in a stream
of pure plasma.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.477
<i>Pure plasma.</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:09.356
This is hot enough to cut through
any material, including this steel.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.775
<i>Including this steel.</i>

19:12.526 --> 19:15.404
I love the smell
of burning forearm hair in the afternoon.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.244
Nice.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.208
And there we have it.
We have a half a scissor.

19:28.292 --> 19:32.171
All right. We got this one done.
Three more to go. Let's start cutting.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.757
Ha!

19:38.510 --> 19:39.511
Ha!

19:43.182 --> 19:46.018
All right. What you're looking at here
is my CNC machine.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.938
We're gonna make the mechanism
for the Rock-paper-scissor game.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.315
I arrived at these shapes

19:51.398 --> 19:54.401
by taking a photograph
of the original model that I made,

19:55.277 --> 19:58.155
bringing it into the computer,
scaling it up to full-size,

19:58.238 --> 20:00.407
and that's how I arrived
at all these parts.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.911
And we're gonna cut all the parts that
make up that mechanism out of plywood.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.290
It's kinda like sending something
to a printer.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.959
You just put
a piece of plywood in, hit start,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.462
and it does the same shape over and over.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.511
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

20:22.012 --> 20:23.263
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>

20:23.347 --> 20:25.349
<i>Time to talk to the kids again.</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:26.767
Oh hey, guys.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.727
<i>-Hey, Jimmy.</i>
-You're still alive.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.356
-<i>We wanna see how the build is going!</i>
-Not allowed to show youanything.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.274
<i>We can see the big, giant hand!</i>

20:34.358 --> 20:37.653
-<i>That's right.</i>
<i>-That guy is trying to hide from us.</i>

20:37.736 --> 20:39.071
Who's trying to hide something?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.657
We got a lot of work to do.
What's going on? What you doing here?

20:41.740 --> 20:45.452
<i>We want to add something</i>
<i>a little more exciting.</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:46.870
Oh no. What do you have?

20:47.537 --> 20:48.956
<i>Jimmy knows the drill.</i>

20:50.707 --> 20:53.460
<i>So we want the loser to be punished.</i>

20:53.543 --> 20:55.045
<i>We want a contraption.</i>

20:55.128 --> 21:01.093
<i>We want you to dump</i>
<i>spoiled, chocolate ice-cream on the loser.</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:02.261
What?

21:02.344 --> 21:06.682
<i>And then put some pickles,</i>
<i>some cauliflower, and some throw-up.</i>

21:08.475 --> 21:10.894
It's a good thing we saved
that bucket of throw-up.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.230
What the hell are you talking about?

21:13.313 --> 21:14.481
<i>Yeah, so once you lose,</i>

21:14.564 --> 21:18.193
<i>you have to sit down</i>
<i>on the contraption, and it pours on you.</i>

21:18.277 --> 21:22.197
You know you guys are sick in the head?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.700
<i>-Not as sick as you!</i>
<i>-Ooh!</i>

21:25.325 --> 21:29.579
-Ooh!

21:29.663 --> 21:31.081
<i>You better get to work.</i>

21:31.164 --> 21:34.876
<i>You better get to work</i>
<i>because we want it on the spot, people!</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:36.086
<i>We really mean it!</i>

21:36.169 --> 21:39.006
You don't tell me when we're done.
I tell you when we're done.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.549
-We're done.
-Bye.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.718
Thanks for coming by.
It was good seeing you.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.261
-See you later.
<i>-See you!</i>

21:44.344 --> 21:45.971
Whew! Man!

21:46.054 --> 21:49.016
We should have it shoot tranquilizers
and shoot those two kids.

21:50.017 --> 21:50.851
It's crazy.

21:50.934 --> 21:55.147
-We gotta make another mechanism.
-To dump all sour stuff on ourselves?

21:55.230 --> 21:57.107
Hey, it does add a sense of competition.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.775
It ups the stakes.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.611
That means we need to pick teams, huh?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.572
I'm the referee. It's amongst you four.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.449
I was working with you all day.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.993
I guess it makes sense
if I'm teaming up with you.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.077
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.622
Team chosen here.
By default, it's you two against you two.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.915
-Wait. What?
-Too slow.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.252
So it looks like it's me and Pat
versus you two clowns.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.462
I'm not scared.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.881
I'm busy with the original contraption
of throwing the fist.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.216
Jackman, you wanna handle
the vomit contraption?

22:23.300 --> 22:26.178
-I can do that.
-Everybody else back to work.

22:30.223 --> 22:34.144
Just look at the way it goes down,
rock beats scissors. Right?

22:34.227 --> 22:35.062
Of course.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.190
-But then paper beats rock?
-Right.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.984
I'm not buying it.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.820
-It's a metaphor.
-Yeah, but it's stupid.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.867
If you seen paper and rock,
which one would you think is tougher?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.577
Rock is definitely tougher,

22:50.660 --> 22:53.789
but for the rules of the game,
you got to go with paper covers.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.124
Otherwise, you choose rock
every single time.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.584
Win every time.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.218
Once you got them smooth,
throw a coat of paint on.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.677
I have an idea.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.931
-What color?
-I wanna cover them with chips of wood.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.140
Huh.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.226
A normal person
might look at these hands,

23:14.309 --> 23:16.520
slap a coat of paint on them,
call it a day.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.313
Sometimes I wish I could do that

23:18.397 --> 23:21.817
because believe me, I have better things
to do than make stuff for brats.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.945
But now that we've taken it this far,
I just can't phone it in.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.447
-Okay. Check it out.
-Oh. Show me.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.659
These are the tiles we're gonna
glue on the face of this Styrofoam.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.245
-You're kidding.
-Is this my kidding face?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.789
That's your everyday face.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.750
Am I 99% sure
these kids won't even care?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.043
Absolutely.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.880
But either way, an easy coat
of paint just ain't gonna cut it.

23:43.964 --> 23:48.051
Why is it always the easy way,
and then your way?

23:48.635 --> 23:49.553
It's for the kids.

23:51.054 --> 23:54.433
You have a heart, man.
It's small, but it's in there.

23:54.516 --> 23:58.311
-Is this where the montage begins?
-Roll the montage!

23:59.104 --> 24:02.607
To serve as our adhesive,
we mixed up some auto body filler.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.026
That'll be good.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.989
We're using it here because it's
a strong adhesive that cures quickly.

24:09.072 --> 24:12.701
We have a lot of fastening to do
before these hands are ready to throwdown.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.258
All right. So…

24:28.341 --> 24:31.052
So now we need to
make those handles more beefy.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.473
-Yep. Nice, nice.
-And we have some tubing here.

24:34.556 --> 24:38.685
The first thing to do is to put it there.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.937
So once we get the inside and outside,

24:41.021 --> 24:44.774
we're gonna do a simple wrap here.
We'll probably use some spray adhesive.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.067
-Sounds like a plan.
-Cool.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.446
With rubber tubing,
to give it some extra volume…

24:49.529 --> 24:50.906
-It's strong.
-Yeah.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.116
…we'll wrap this leather
around the handles

24:53.200 --> 24:54.826
of each half of the scissors.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.536
All right. Ready? Send it.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.458
Add a single bolt in the middle,
and there you have it.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.503
<i>-Et voila!</i>
-Let's see if these make the cut.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.670
Give it a shot.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.214
Just like that joke did.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.180
-That's perfect.
-That's so ridiculous.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.351
<i>Meet</i>
<i>the Mega-5000 Super Scissors</i>

25:19.434 --> 25:21.895
<i>you didn't even know you needed!</i>

25:21.978 --> 25:24.064
Ooh!

25:24.147 --> 25:25.732
<i>They cut paper!</i>

25:28.652 --> 25:30.487
<i>They slice paper!</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:36.076
<i> Standard</i>
<i>8.5x11 printer paper?</i>

25:36.159 --> 25:39.037
<i>-No problem!</i>

25:39.120 --> 25:40.956
<i> Try to lift them alone?</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:42.415
<i>No way.</i>

25:42.499 --> 25:43.625
<i>Big mistake!</i>

25:43.708 --> 25:44.626
Oh my…

25:44.709 --> 25:47.003
-It weighs a ton.
-It does weigh a lot.

25:47.087 --> 25:51.007
<i>They're Mega-5000 huge!</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:52.759
-Yeah.
Let's go show it to Jimmy.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.845
<i>They're Mega-5000 Super Scissors!</i>

25:55.929 --> 25:58.765
<i>Order now and get a free ream</i>
<i>of 8.5x11 printer paper.</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:06.606
-Hey. Oh my God. Look at that.
-Oh, bam!

26:06.690 --> 26:09.109
-Wow.
-How do you like these scissors?

26:10.443 --> 26:11.361
How's that?

26:11.444 --> 26:14.114
-It looks pretty good.
-Thank you. Thank you.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.158
-How heavy is it?
-I'd say 50 pounds, maybe.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.535
Here. You wanna try?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.123
Oh jeez.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.584
-They're heavy.
-I don't know how this is gonna work.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.793
-Say what?
-Nothing.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.962
The mechanism for the hand
is now assembled,

26:29.045 --> 26:32.007
but I'm getting worried
about how much weight it could hold.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.594
To test it,
we're gonna loosely add the hand

26:35.677 --> 26:37.220
to see how the lever performs…

26:37.304 --> 26:38.555
-Watch out!
-Oh my God.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.056
…with some added weight.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.350
Easy, easy.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.893
Last thing I ever see.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.688
Big stupid hand made out of wood chips.
Whose idea was that?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.776
-Looks good.
-How's my hair?

26:51.860 --> 26:53.987
Let it go. Let me try pulling it back.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.822
No. You can't.

26:55.905 --> 26:56.990
Okay. You can.

26:58.199 --> 27:01.202
That's a lot.
Gonna need some kind of support, help.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.164
-If we had the bands on it…
-Yeah. We need some big bands.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.540
Anything could help.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.459
-You guys see the original model?
-Yeah.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.252
How the weight comes back up.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.756
We need something
that acts like this rubber band.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.300
I have a roll of exercise rubber.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.218
I think it would work.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.972
This exercise rubber,
also known as resistance bands,

27:21.056 --> 27:23.099
has a very high tensile strength.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.186
That means it can stretch
very far without breaking.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.188
Even under a lot of pressure.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.190
Let's just try this quickly as a test.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.359
This is only a test.

27:32.442 --> 27:36.946
Once it's stretched, the tension
should help ease the weight on the lever.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.407
See what happens when you go down,
come back up.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.451
Watch your face, Jackman.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.207
Yeah. That's doing absolutely…

27:49.334 --> 27:50.293
nothing.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.422
-So we just need more.
-Thirty more of those would be good.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.632
Maybe.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.260
We'll come up with something,
but we know the concept works.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.178
Perfect.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.224
I'm working
on the punishment mechanism here.

28:04.307 --> 28:08.061
Concept is basically an A-frame
with a seat that the loser's gonna sit on.

28:08.144 --> 28:11.856
As long as we don't end up on that bench,
I don't care how it works, dude.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.068
The frame is built,
but we need a slop dump system.

28:15.151 --> 28:15.985
<i>Slop it!</i>

28:16.069 --> 28:19.406
So I'm rigging this platform
with two quick-release pins.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.407
<i>And dump it.</i>

28:20.490 --> 28:23.743
Then, I'm cutting down these
trash cans and attaching them to the top.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.870
Kind of garbage project, if you ask me.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.916
It will soon be filled
to the brim with gross, spoiled food,

28:29.999 --> 28:33.169
like melted chocolate ice-cream,
hot sauce, cauliflower,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.797
basically all the stuff
Derek hides in his beard.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.757
-You like cauliflower?
-Not on my head.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.636
<i>Slop it! Dump it! Dump it!</i>
<i>Slop it! Slop it! Dump it! Dump it!</i>

28:41.720 --> 28:44.556
<i>Slop it! Slop it! Dump it! Dump it!</i>

28:44.639 --> 28:46.057
You finished over there?

28:46.141 --> 28:48.101
<i>Slop it! Slop it! Slop it!</i>

28:48.184 --> 28:50.937
Almost. Hey, come over here.
See how it works.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.441
-You wanna pull the trigger?
-Wow. Nice job.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.986
Let's try it for real.
Got anything we could dump in there?

28:58.069 --> 29:01.698
Is it three, two, one
and then we do it, or is it on one?

29:01.781 --> 29:03.825
Three, two, on one, yank it.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.953
Three, two, one!

29:08.538 --> 29:10.165
-Oh yeah.
-It's pretty good.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.751
-This melted chocolate will do this.
-Yeah.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.252
Plop, plop, plop.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.838
-Graz, grab a broom. Get over here.
-Janitor!

29:18.757 --> 29:21.551
-What am I doing?
-We tested it with the sweeping compound.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.053
-It actually worked!
-I feel bad for whoever loses.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.972
You figure out your weight issue
with the hands?

29:26.055 --> 29:27.474
-Problems?
-Problems.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.769
I did. I added some springs,
which will help counteract the weight.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.020
<i>Problem solved!</i>

29:35.523 --> 29:37.817
-You see this big, heavy spring?
-Yeah.

29:37.901 --> 29:41.154
That would be for a garage door.
Then we have this little one under here.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.281
It's holding the weight
of the hand. For now.

29:44.073 --> 29:46.034
-That's so much better.
-Yeah.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.578
Let me explain
why this thing is working now.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.581
Springs store
potential energy when coiled.

29:52.540 --> 29:56.085
As the coil expands,
the tension creates kinetic energy,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.963
which helps return
the spring and the heavy hand

29:59.047 --> 30:00.757
to its original position.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.009
Is the weight of the scissors, is that--

30:03.092 --> 30:05.386
I think it's definitely doable.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.723
It's doable. We gotta button these up,
get these finished.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.558
We gotta get them ready
for Chris and Malia.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.893
All right. Let's do it.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.978
-Let's go.
-Okay. Need a hand?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.064
-I do.
-You have a giant one here.

30:16.147 --> 30:19.317
-I got it! I got it!
-There we go!

30:19.400 --> 30:22.529
We've got a lot of work to do
to get this contraption up and running.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.406
Jackman is painting the chair of torture.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.159
-It's beautiful.
-Derek is painting one hand blue.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.453
This is gonna have drips
all over it.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.997
Just rub it in the cracks.
It's gonna look good once it dries.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.541
And I'm, uh…

30:34.624 --> 30:36.960
I'll let you take one guess
at what I'm doing.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.421
Not painting.
I'm doing voice-overs. Can't you tell?

30:41.714 --> 30:43.299
You guys wanted a TV show.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.426
This is the punishment.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.846
And now that we've exercised
our inner Picasso,

30:47.929 --> 30:51.266
we can attach these giant mitts
to the throwing machine.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.728
Looks like a monster's hand.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.397
It does. It looks good.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.781
If this doesn't do it,
I don't know what will.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.117
Hopefully those nitwits
don't kill each other.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.829
No. I think they're still gonna kill
each other, but they look great.

31:12.912 --> 31:15.582
-They look like rock, paper, and scissors.
-They do.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.875
They're pretty cool.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.294
-Let's call it a night.
-Good night.

31:19.961 --> 31:20.920
Well done.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.760
-Hey, Graz.
-Graz.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.722
Doesn't the janitor
usually stay behind?

31:43.484 --> 31:45.486
Jackman, is the punishment device
ready to go?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.113
It's all ready for these guys.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.156
-What?
-What?

31:48.239 --> 31:50.742
Yeah. I made it sized just for you guys
to sit down in the seat...

31:50.825 --> 31:53.995
That's gonna be unfortunate because it's
gonna suck to sit on when you guys lose.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.540
Let's be real. When Chris and Malia pop up
on-screen, we're all gonna be losers.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.167
-Great.
-Ready, Derek?

31:59.250 --> 32:01.002
-Ready?
-Yeah.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.922
Man the doors.
Let's get Chris and Malia here.

32:04.505 --> 32:07.842
Time to show them what Rock,
Paper, Scissors on steroids looks like.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.385
-Chris and Malia.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.303
<i>Yep.</i>

32:10.386 --> 32:12.055
-How are you guys?
<i>-Good.</i>

32:12.138 --> 32:14.599
-You guys are as excited to be here as me!

32:14.682 --> 32:16.517
Do you remember what you asked for?

32:16.601 --> 32:20.688
<i> I wanted</i>
<i>a Rock-paper-scissor machine!</i>

32:20.772 --> 32:22.899
Tell me a little bit more
about what you expect to see.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.693
<i>I expect to see something big</i>
<i>and something good.</i>

32:25.777 --> 32:28.071
I think we checked one of those boxes.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.530
<i>Yeah. That's what's up!</i>

32:29.614 --> 32:31.532
-What else did you want?
<i>-A punishment.</i>

32:31.616 --> 32:34.535
-A punishment.
<i>-Spoiled chocolate ice-cream.</i>

32:35.787 --> 32:38.581
<i>-Pickles, cauliflower, throw-up!</i>

32:40.750 --> 32:42.585
Just adorable, aren't they?

32:42.669 --> 32:45.129
<i>We want to know what's behind that door!</i>

32:45.213 --> 32:48.257
-You guys ready to see this?

32:48.341 --> 32:50.426
That's the enthusiasm I'm looking for.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.636
<i>Yes.</i>

32:51.719 --> 32:52.887
Are you ready to see this?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.806
<i> Show it to me!</i>

32:54.889 --> 32:56.975
All right, guys. You heard it! Hit it!

33:04.649 --> 33:06.567
What?

33:07.902 --> 33:09.696
<i>Why is there smoke everywhere?</i>

33:09.779 --> 33:11.489
They just legalized it.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.367
<i>Oh my God!</i>

33:20.540 --> 33:21.374
<i>Cool!</i>

33:21.457 --> 33:24.293
First, you can see the beautiful
hands that me and Derek made.

33:24.377 --> 33:28.339
We went with a beautiful artisanal
tile design, mosaic style,

33:28.423 --> 33:31.968
covering the foam
with beautifully sliced wood.

33:32.051 --> 33:35.054
We have a blue hand versus the red hand.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.890
Those hands sit on top
of a giant throwing machine,

33:37.974 --> 33:41.561
and when we push the lever,
the hands throw into the ring.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.812
Then we know who won.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.648
Moving on. Let's show you
the beautifully crafted rock

33:45.732 --> 33:47.358
made by Graz, Pat.

33:47.442 --> 33:51.112
First, I just wanna say the rock
is probably the coolest out of the three.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.280
Everyone loves rocks.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.823
<i>Rocks are dumb.</i>

33:53.906 --> 33:55.783
Is it too late to "next" these kids?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.912
For the rock,
we crumpled up a bunch of paper,

33:59.996 --> 34:01.914
surrounded it with canvas, painted it,

34:01.998 --> 34:05.626
and then it looks like a big,
giant rock as big as a rock.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.919
That's a 1:1 scale.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.921
-Really?
-Dead on. I'm surprised too.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.381
<i>That guy loves rocks, huh?</i>

34:10.465 --> 34:12.300
Next up, we have the paper.

34:12.383 --> 34:16.054
It's just a big sonotube
wrapped in rope and canvas and foam.

34:16.137 --> 34:19.057
Feels like toilet paper. What's more fun
than a giant roll of toilet paper?

34:19.140 --> 34:23.019
Next up, we have the scissors
made, again, by Pat and Graz.

34:23.102 --> 34:26.606
Fun fact. They weigh about 1,000 pounds,
and they're gonna destroy the set.

34:26.689 --> 34:29.442
<i>Why did you have to make</i>
<i>the scissors so heavy, Graz?</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:42.371
I was just gonna say that, Pat.
That was good.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.165
<i>What about the torture machine?</i>

34:44.248 --> 34:46.709
The torture machine
is right up on the grass,

34:46.793 --> 34:48.419
waiting to humiliate the losers.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.463
You wanna see this thing in action?

34:50.546 --> 34:52.090
<i>We're so ready!</i>

34:52.173 --> 34:54.133
All right, you heard 'em.
It's game time.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.855
Chris and Malia, welcome
to the dumbest fight of the century.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.734
<i>We're ready to see the dumbest</i>
<i>of the dumbest thing in history.</i>

35:11.818 --> 35:13.402
-Perfect!
It's not dumb.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.530
In the red corner,

35:15.613 --> 35:18.366
weighing in at a combined weight
of one and a half people,

35:18.449 --> 35:20.660
is Canadian "Crazy Eyes" Pat

35:20.743 --> 35:24.789
and John "Enough
With the Short Jokes" Graziano.

35:24.872 --> 35:28.709
In our blue corner,
weighing more than they want to admit,

35:28.793 --> 35:31.504
Derek "Nothing Beats Rock" Malden

35:31.587 --> 35:33.422
and Paul "Two Ply" Jackman.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.383
Yeah, I don't know
what that means but okay.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.970
The best two out of three wins

35:39.053 --> 35:42.390
and avoid the chair of torture.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.143
<i>Yes!</i>

35:45.768 --> 35:47.603
Gentlemen, I expect a fair fight,

35:47.687 --> 35:50.731
and I expect two of you
to be fully humiliated.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.567
-Yeah!
-Let's throw down, guys!

35:52.650 --> 35:54.819
<i>Let's throw down!</i>

35:54.902 --> 35:56.154
-Let's do this!

35:56.237 --> 36:00.366
The teams will now enter their
respective corners in a very cool way.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.284
Oh!

36:01.784 --> 36:03.786
As well as
a very uncool way, apparently.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.622
Gentlemen, choose your weapons!

36:06.706 --> 36:07.999
Let's do rock.

36:08.082 --> 36:11.752
Remember how earlier you told everybody
that you throw rock every time?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.171
That's why they won't expect it.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.840
Derek's gonna be trying to get Jackman
to throw rock every time,

36:15.923 --> 36:18.342
but I bet you Jackman's gonna throw
something else like paper.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.760
-I'm going rock.
-No.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.096
-Scissors. Feeling good?
-Yeah. Sure.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.349
-No.
-Okay, gentlemen, are you ready?

36:25.433 --> 36:26.392
-Yeah!
-Yes!

36:26.893 --> 36:29.854
One, two, three, shoot!

36:30.354 --> 36:34.275
Whoa! Blue team
is the winner of round one!

36:34.358 --> 36:35.776
-They throw rock?
-Yeah.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.944
Blue team one!

36:37.028 --> 36:39.238
-Come on!
-Red team zero!

36:39.322 --> 36:41.032
Yes! Losers!

36:41.115 --> 36:43.618
Yeah. Could you guys help me?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.411
-Oh!

36:45.494 --> 36:47.830
Graz! I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

36:47.914 --> 36:49.373
Make a bigger handle!

36:49.457 --> 36:50.708
-You guys need help?
-No.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.168
-I got it.
-Losers.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.378
-I got it.
-Who do you think will win the next round?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.923
Where's your money?
<i>-My money's on blue, dawg.</i>

36:57.006 --> 36:58.174
<i>My money's on blue.</i>

36:58.257 --> 37:00.343
Rock wins every time.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.427
I say we do rock.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.430
Okay. But, I mean, I have
a preference for the scissors.

37:04.513 --> 37:07.058
Now they're gonna think
that I'm not gonna throw it

37:07.141 --> 37:08.809
because I was baiting them.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.062
-I don't think they're that smart.
-They're not.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.231
Screw putting anything else up.
It's too heavy.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.149
-We'll just leave it up. Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.069
Told you rock every time.
You insist on paper.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.654
Gentlemen, are you ready?

37:19.737 --> 37:20.655
Yes!

37:20.738 --> 37:21.614
<i>Let's go!</i>

37:21.697 --> 37:25.368
One, a-two, a-three, shoot!

37:26.035 --> 37:27.536
Whoa!

37:27.620 --> 37:29.664
-Did we win?
-The red team has won.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.165
Yes!

37:31.249 --> 37:33.084
No way
they'd throw scissors again.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.086
Blue team, one. Red team, one!

37:35.169 --> 37:37.588
Booyah! Booyah!

37:37.672 --> 37:40.424
Booyah!

37:40.508 --> 37:41.467
Come back here.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.804
The next point is the winner
and avoids the chair of pain.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.472
-We're gonna win!
-Yeah.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.392
-We're gonna win!
-We're gonna win!

37:49.475 --> 37:52.061
The loser of this round
will sit in the chair of torture.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.480
And will get pickles, melted ice cream,

37:54.563 --> 37:57.483
cauliflower, hot sauce
poured into their eyes and their mouth!

37:57.566 --> 37:59.026
-Oh God!

37:59.110 --> 38:01.112
-Are your machines set?
-Let's do this!

38:01.195 --> 38:03.739
-On one, on two, on three…
-Yes!

38:05.825 --> 38:06.826
Shoot!

38:13.416 --> 38:14.500
Oh God!

38:15.126 --> 38:16.585
-Did we win?
-No. They drew rock!

38:16.669 --> 38:19.463
-Rock beats scissors for the win!
-Oh!

38:19.547 --> 38:22.758
Gentlemen, you must sit
in the chair of disappointment.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.844
-What is it called?

38:24.927 --> 38:26.053
Chair of torture.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.097
Chair of disappointment.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.558
-Graz and Pat, you know the rules.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.978
It's time to go
to the chair of pain, torture.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.396
Can't remember it, no matter what.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.440
-He's already gagging.
-Rules are rules.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.742
Do you want some, Pat?

38:47.825 --> 38:49.368
Oh!

38:50.745 --> 38:52.163
That gross enough for you?

38:52.246 --> 38:53.956
-Let's just get this over with.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.458
-Dead men walking.
-Yeah.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.877
-Take a seat. Get comfy.
-Get comfortable.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.838
-It hurts us more than it's hurting you.
-Hold hands.

39:00.921 --> 39:03.132
Chris and Malia,
count it down with me. Ready?

39:03.215 --> 39:05.551
-<i>Three, two…</i>
-Two, one!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.470
Shoot!

39:07.553 --> 39:09.096
Shoot!

39:20.691 --> 39:23.736
-<i>Yes!</i>

39:28.824 --> 39:32.119
Are you happy you humiliated
two grown men on television?

39:32.203 --> 39:33.496
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

39:33.579 --> 39:35.498
<i>We're very proud of ourselves.</i>

39:35.581 --> 39:37.708
I'd say that's mission accomplished.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.044
<i>Mission accomplished! You did good!</i>

39:40.127 --> 39:41.796
I'm happy with this conclusion.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.672
Go back to torturing your parents.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.633
<i>Okay.</i>

39:47.551 --> 39:49.261
-Losers clean up. Right?
-Yep.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.431
-This is kinda romantic.
-Yeah.
