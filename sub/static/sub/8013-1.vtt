46:39.019 --> 46:40.354
Hi.

46:40.355 --> 46:42.488
I'm Trevor.

46:42.489 --> 46:44.691
I'm Danny.

46:44.692 --> 46:49.063
You know, you look like
you need a little rescuing.

46:50.097 --> 46:52.365
Maybe just a little. (CHUCKLES)

46:53.601 --> 46:57.236
So, um, this particular shithole

46:57.237 --> 47:01.073
does not look like Danny's natural habitat.

47:01.074 --> 47:04.978
Now that is a very interesting picture.

47:09.449 --> 47:12.551
If I were to ask you to dance with me,

47:12.552 --> 47:15.522
despite this being a particular shithole,

47:15.523 --> 47:17.357
what would you say?

47:17.358 --> 47:21.595
Um, no, really. (STAMMERS)
I'm a terrible dancer.

47:21.596 --> 47:24.263
I mean, my little sister,
she's always telling me

47:24.264 --> 47:28.535
I dance like Frankenstein's monster.

47:28.536 --> 47:30.570
Come on, Danny.

47:36.376 --> 47:39.212
Okay.

47:39.213 --> 47:41.515
All right.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.736
What's wrong? Why you so sad?

48:02.737 --> 48:04.404
Who's that guy?

48:04.405 --> 48:06.105
QUEEN CONGA: His name is Trevor.

48:06.106 --> 48:09.442
(CHUCKLES) He's very political.

48:09.443 --> 48:11.511
And he clearly has money.

48:11.512 --> 48:12.779
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

48:12.780 --> 48:14.513
Maybe your Danny Boy has found his way

48:14.514 --> 48:17.317
without your help after all.

48:17.318 --> 48:19.718
QUEEN CONGA: Mmm.

48:19.719 --> 48:21.520
So if you hate this place so much,

48:21.521 --> 48:23.323
what are you doing here?

48:23.324 --> 48:25.625
I'm writing an article about the Stonewall.

48:25.626 --> 48:27.194
You're a writer?

48:27.195 --> 48:30.663
No, I'm a member of the Mattachine Society.

48:30.664 --> 48:32.866
What's that?

48:32.867 --> 48:36.569
We're an organization
that fights for gay rights.

48:36.570 --> 48:39.506
Take Stonewall, for example.

48:39.507 --> 48:41.508
You know it's run by crooks

48:41.509 --> 48:45.444
who rip off and poison gay men.

48:45.445 --> 48:48.449
We deserve the right to own our own clubs.

48:52.753 --> 48:54.386
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

48:54.387 --> 48:56.489
Just relax.

49:11.706 --> 49:13.540
- COP: All right, it's a raid!
- Fuck!

49:13.541 --> 49:16.276
COP 3: Let's go! Up against the wall.

49:16.277 --> 49:18.511
- Come on. Get back.
- COP 4: All right, ladies.

49:18.512 --> 49:21.348
You know the drill, huh? IDs, please.

49:21.349 --> 49:22.549
(MUSIC STOPS)

49:22.550 --> 49:24.683
Get in a line up against the walls.

49:24.684 --> 49:26.585
This'll all be over in a second.

49:26.586 --> 49:28.187
They only arrest the trannies.

49:28.188 --> 49:30.290
It's the "three article of clothing" rule.

49:30.291 --> 49:31.558
They're also gonna arrest the dykes

49:31.559 --> 49:33.392
because they're wearing men's clothes.

49:33.393 --> 49:36.730
This is what we're fighting
against, this bullshit.

49:36.731 --> 49:38.931
No, no. You stay right there, okay.

49:38.932 --> 49:40.600
You should come to one of our meetings.

49:40.601 --> 49:42.535
Around the corner on Christopher Street.

49:42.536 --> 49:44.203
I'll be seeing you, Danny.

49:44.204 --> 49:46.372
COP: Let's see some IDs here.

49:46.373 --> 49:49.342
Ray. Ray.

49:53.313 --> 49:56.249
If any of you Lily Law girls wanna dance,

49:56.250 --> 49:57.283
well, here I am.

49:57.284 --> 49:58.451
(ALL CHEERING)

49:58.452 --> 49:59.886
Ten cents a dance.

49:59.887 --> 50:01.654
For all men in uniforms...

50:01.655 --> 50:02.955
Out of here. Let's go.

50:02.956 --> 50:04.723
(ALL CHEERING)

50:04.724 --> 50:07.627
Life is free!

50:07.628 --> 50:10.296
Life is free!

50:10.297 --> 50:12.799
Hey, ain't your mother
never teach you no respect?

50:12.800 --> 50:14.834
Jesus, God!

50:14.835 --> 50:16.636
What a fuckin' disgrace you are.

50:16.637 --> 50:18.270
More than you?

50:18.271 --> 50:19.672
I know y'all pigs get paid off

50:19.673 --> 50:20.874
every time you raid this place.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.308
I probably paid for all

50:22.309 --> 50:23.442
of your kids' Christmas presents.

50:23.443 --> 50:24.977
- (GROANS)
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

50:24.978 --> 50:26.613
MAN: Fuck, man!

50:26.614 --> 50:27.913
You fuckin' mention my kids, huh?

50:27.914 --> 50:29.884
Officer!

50:31.552 --> 50:36.522
Well, mister,

50:36.523 --> 50:40.560
I actually only have

50:40.561 --> 50:43.964
one item of clothing.

50:43.965 --> 50:45.598
I made it myself.

50:45.599 --> 50:49.502
(ALL CHEERING)

50:50.905 --> 50:52.839
Isn't it gorgeous?

50:52.840 --> 50:54.941
Get this bitch out of my sight!

50:54.942 --> 50:57.544
Get your hands off me!

50:57.545 --> 50:59.846
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

50:59.847 --> 51:01.747
I want everybody's ID
or everybody's cuffed.

51:01.748 --> 51:04.684
I want some ID right now.

51:08.556 --> 51:12.259
Get out of here. I want some ID!

51:12.260 --> 51:13.526
Fuck! Danny! Ow!

51:13.527 --> 51:15.027
Shit!

51:15.028 --> 51:16.495
- MARSHA: Ray!
- RAY: Danny!

51:16.496 --> 51:17.497
- You wanna go, too?
- Okay, okay.

51:17.498 --> 51:20.500
(RAY GROANS)

51:20.501 --> 51:22.334
Fairy queens of Sheridan Square are here.

51:22.335 --> 51:23.870
Just my fuckin' luck.

51:23.871 --> 51:25.504
Hi, Sam.

51:25.505 --> 51:27.540
No sign of Murphy.

51:27.541 --> 51:28.607
Somebody tipped him off.

51:28.608 --> 51:30.610
Maybe.

51:32.380 --> 51:33.747
SEYMOUR: Who's that guy?

51:33.748 --> 51:35.948
- DEP. JACK: Fields?
- That sergeant out of the 6th.

51:35.949 --> 51:37.683
He's a good man.

51:37.684 --> 51:39.618
Is he?

51:39.619 --> 51:41.321
Well, that'd be a new one
because the information I have

51:41.322 --> 51:44.291
is the whole fuckin' precinct is rotten.
