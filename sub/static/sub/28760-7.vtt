MAN: Previously
on Queen of the South...

00:04.530 --> 00:06.134
We're at war,
and you disappear

00:06.170 --> 00:07.694
-to screw some bitch?
-Watch your mouth, puto!

00:07.740 --> 00:09.799
-TERESA: Who is she?
-She's Boaz' ex-fianc.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.035
-And she's with you now.
-5.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.503
You putting it
to that boss lady of yours?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.371
(both grunting)

00:16.410 --> 00:18.002
Where's the car?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.041
I would like to resume
our busmess deal.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.717
All right.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.710
_ This isn't some
"Tia-Juana" flea market,

00:28.760 --> 00:30.227
Miss Mendoza.

00:30.260 --> 00:34.151
-Now, if you'll excuse me--
-Okay. 10%.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.919
You'll see how much smoother
things go for ya.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.824
(laughs)

00:38.870 --> 00:40.497
-TERESA: Who's that playing?
-EDDIE: Friend of mine.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.269
You should put that
on an album.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.437
-He's great.
-He's no longer with us.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.404
-Are the Sicarios dead?
-One of them is.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.476
I couldn't find the body
of the second one.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.771
Tony's father--
he was stealing from my boss,

00:52.820 --> 00:55.573
and I was just following orders
and he knew the rules.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.212
That's why I felt nothing

00:57.250 --> 00:59.912
when I squeezed the trigger
and took his life.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.884
(escalating music)

01:02.930 --> 01:04.283

01:15.900 --> 01:18.630

01:18.670 --> 01:20.729
(screaming)

01:20.780 --> 01:24.568
(man shouting in game)

01:24.610 --> 01:27.579
Why don't you go outside,
do something else?

01:27.620 --> 01:29.383
I'm in a groove here.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.240
Practicing for when
I become your solider.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.885
I told you...
you're not working for me.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.320
And you don't want me
to live with you either.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.396
These people are not
my family.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.091
You are.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.121
-(explosions booming)
-MAN: Move, move, move!

01:43.170 --> 01:45.491
You say we've only
got each other.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.430
And then you're always
dumping me somewhere.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.789
(gunfire)

01:48.840 --> 01:50.501
I'm not dumping you.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.929
I trust Pote with my life.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.902
If you say so.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.909
-(booming, gunfire)
-(men shouting)

01:58.950 --> 02:01.919
(somber music)

02:01.950 --> 02:08.958

02:17.730 --> 02:18.719
Uh-huh.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.638
(spoon clatters)

02:23.140 --> 02:25.108
He's angry.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.903
He's been through a lot.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.109
We would be angry too.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.539
When I come back from
Nashville,

02:32.580 --> 02:34.309
we need to do something
for him.

02:34.350 --> 02:37.615
I don't know--
therapy, school.

02:37.650 --> 02:38.844
I really wish you weren't

02:38.890 --> 02:41.154
going alone on this trip,
Teresita.

02:42.390 --> 02:44.585
Eddie's introducing me
to his old band.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.218
It's like meeting
his family.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.023
Huh.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.197
It's just one day.

02:51.930 --> 02:53.295
(sighs)

02:53.340 --> 02:55.331
Maybe you could get Tony
to go outside.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.031
I don't do outside.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.000
Fine.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.305
This needs to sit anyways.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.045
(clattering)

03:05.080 --> 03:06.240
Thank you.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.168
De nada.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.018
Just be careful, Teresita.

03:11.050 --> 03:12.017
I will.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.257
I'll call you.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.835
RANDALL: And so we're reaching
out to the public.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.599
If anybody
has any information

03:29.640 --> 03:32.404
on the whereabouts
of this man, Rene Bardot,

03:32.440 --> 03:35.238
please contact the number
on your screen.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.578
Mr. Bardot has been missing
for over two weeks,

03:37.610 --> 03:40.670
and his uncle, the Honorable
Judge Cecil Lafayette,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.745
is very anxious to find him.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.350
Again,
anyone with any information,

03:45.390 --> 03:48.018
please contact
the number on your screen.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.028
-Thank you.
-The Judge's nephew.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.449
(television announcer
speaks indistinctly)

03:52.500 --> 03:54.092
__EMILIA:
DIJISte algo?

03:57.600 --> 03:58.624
No.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.733
Casual Teresa.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.240
I like her.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.451
You're full of surprises.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.920
Tell you the truth,

04:26.960 --> 04:28.791
I wasn't sure you were
gonna be able to let go

04:28.830 --> 04:30.889
of the business reins
for an entire day.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.137
(chuckles)
I'm looking forward to it.

04:38.670 --> 04:41.901
(suspenseful music)

04:41.940 --> 04:48.948

04:51.790 --> 04:54.213
(engine turns over)

04:55.990 --> 04:58.185
(both chuckle)

04:59.330 --> 05:01.525
-You ready? Okay.
-Yeah.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.869
(engine turns over)

05:03.900 --> 05:08.098
*

05:08.140 --> 05:11.109
(dramatic chords)

05:20.880 --> 05:21.209
I miss the road.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.942
Most of the guys
hate touring,

05:24.990 --> 05:28.289
but it was one of my favorite
parts of the life.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.651
You miss the groupies.

05:29.690 --> 05:31.851
(laughing)
What?

05:31.890 --> 05:33.357
No.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.890
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

05:34.930 --> 05:37.865
it was fun when I was
in my 205, but...

05:37.900 --> 05:40.289
it was always more than that.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.059
I enjoyed the mystery
and romance.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.907
Never know who you'll meet.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.398
My buddy Leon,

05:47.440 --> 05:50.671
he says every new town
is like a blank canvas.

05:50.710 --> 05:54.840
You just move in
and make a new life.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.416
You ever fantasize
about that?

05:56.450 --> 05:58.884
I think I'm too busy
to daydream.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.080
Indulge me.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.554
Who should we be?

06:04.590 --> 06:07.320
Bonnie and Clyde?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.691
Rob a few dozen banks,

06:08.730 --> 06:11.699
make love on piles
of stolen cash

06:11.730 --> 06:14.563
and die a bullet-ridden death
in slow motion?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.409
I think you watch
too many movies.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.829
(laughs)
That is true.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.406
Your turn.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.075
A house somewhere
WIth a garden.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.273
(laughs) Whenever I think
I got you figured out,

06:27.320 --> 06:28.776
you surprise me.

06:28.820 --> 06:32.608

06:39.600 --> 06:43.388
(gunfire, explosions)

06:43.430 --> 06:45.227
POTE: Tony.

06:45.270 --> 06:48.091
I know Teresa wants you to
babysit me, but I'm good here.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.732
Mm.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.364
You can stay here
and shoot your little toy gun

06:52.410 --> 06:54.970
on a little boy screen,

06:55.010 --> 06:56.204
or you can get up

06:56.240 --> 06:58.606
and shoot a real gun
like a man.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.585
JAVIER: Virgil.
Okay, thank you.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.252
(speaking Spanish)

07:59.810 --> 08:01.334
Vamos.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.678
This is a good rifle
for deer.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.678
It holds thr_ee bullets
at a time.

08:05.710 --> 08:06.972
I'm only gonna need one.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.248
Hey, hey--

08:09.850 --> 08:11.215
Careful where you
point that to.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.888
Sorry!

08:14.690 --> 08:16.385
So...

08:16.420 --> 08:17.523
what are we waiting for?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.458
Paciencia, hijo.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.320
_ First we have to_ see_
If you can shoot thIs thing.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.622
I know how to shoot a gun,
Pote.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.490
Orale, then.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.189
Show me.

08:37.610 --> 08:40.044
-(chuckling)
-(birds squawking)

08:40.080 --> 08:41.809
I'm fine.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.386
(slide clicking,
bullets clattering)

08:43.420 --> 08:44.717
Hunting's not a game.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.217
I just wasn't ready,
all right?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.683
Mijo,

08:47.720 --> 08:49.585
something is troubling you.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.325
You know you can
talk to me.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.691
I'm not your son, okay?

08:54.360 --> 08:56.328
My parents are dead.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.726
When you grow up,
you gonna realize

08:58.770 --> 09:01.398
that family's
not just blood.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.930
It's the people
you choose.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.130
Yeah, well...

09:04.910 --> 09:07.037
I wish I could choose to have
my real family back.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.138
(slide clicking)

09:17.290 --> 09:18.382
Let's go.

09:31.900 --> 09:32.969
It's this way.

(eerie music)

09:38.470 --> 09:45.478
*

09:48.520 --> 09:51.444
I had this fantasy
about spending a long afternoon

09:51.490 --> 09:54.379
alone with you
in a hotel room, but...

09:54.420 --> 09:56.729
we have a sound check
In 15 minutes.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.352
Don't worry about me.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.495
This is for the show
tonight.

10:02.530 --> 10:03.929
You'll need it
to get backstage.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.331
Why don't you take
a long, hot bath...

10:08.370 --> 10:11.009
and I'll try to get back
before the water gets cold.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.530
(chuckles)

10:15.540 --> 10:16.507
Have fun.

MAN: Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

10:52.510 --> 10:54.319
Hi. I'm in room 237,

10:54.350 --> 10:56.238
and my bathtub's not working.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.517
Chinga.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.414
What can I do you
for?

11:35.460 --> 11:37.052
That old Lincoln over there--
It's mIne.

11:37.090 --> 11:39.081
VIRGIL: You don't say?

11:39.130 --> 11:41.894
I just need to see some
identification.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.761
-(inha|es)
-(dog barking)

11:43.800 --> 11:46.360
Mijo, I lost my wallet.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.868
But I brought some famous
politicians to vouch for me.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.061
-You know Ben Franklin?
-Mm-hmm.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.515
Right this way, senor.

12:04.550 --> 12:05.915
Gracias.

12:09.590 --> 12:11.251
VIRGIL: Bon ami.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.599
You got a dead body
in there?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.061
(barking)

12:18.630 --> 12:20.860
Can you keep a secret?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.902
(dog barking)

12:26.070 --> 12:28.277
(lighter clicks shut)

12:28.310 --> 12:30.608
Killed an alligator
that day in the swamp.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.619
She was a beast.

12:33.650 --> 12:36.574
It was almost 10 feet long.
It was incredible.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.815
Took me almost an hour
to get it in the trunk.

12:38.850 --> 12:41.785
Then when I came back
for my stuff...

12:41.820 --> 12:43.481
-car was gone.
-Ca c'est bon.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.986
-Good on you.
-Yeah.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.726
Them lizards,
they a menace to society.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.296
But they make fine boots.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.424
(chuckles)
Can I get me a look-see?

12:52.470 --> 12:54.438
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

12:55.770 --> 12:56.964
Maybe next time, amigo.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.771
I gotta hit the road.

You scared me.
Sorry.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.439
You wanna come in?

14:50.820 --> 14:53.789
No...thank you.

Why don't you come
join me when you're ready?

15:00.430 --> 15:01.397
Sure.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.733
The only thing my father
ever taught me

15:12.770 --> 15:14.374
was how to hunt.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.207
He was like a stranger.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.970
But we would talk when
we'd go out hunting.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.269
What'd he say?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.117
He talked about God.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.458
Life and death things,
you know?

15:27.490 --> 15:28.514
Big things.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.095
Right before
he killed an animal,

15:35.130 --> 15:37.894
he would get really quiet,

15:37.930 --> 15:39.591
like he was almost praying.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.866
Then after the shot, he would
ask God for forgiveness.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.569
For what?

15:46.610 --> 15:48.703
For killing
a living creature.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.504
What's it like
to kill a person?

15:55.980 --> 15:58.380
I hope you never have to
find out, mijo.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.783
It's a terrible thing.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.287
(rustling)

16:03.330 --> 16:04.285
Hey, now.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.469
(ominous music)

16:13.500 --> 16:19.666
*

16:19.710 --> 16:20.836
(chuckles)

16:25.250 --> 16:27.275
(sighs)

16:27.320 --> 16:28.548
(sniffs)

16:29.880 --> 16:31.040
What's wrong?

16:33.420 --> 16:36.651
Being with the old band
brings up a lotta...

16:36.690 --> 16:38.226
buried shit.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.618
You wanna talk about it?

16:41.660 --> 16:44.766
(inhales)
Ah...

16:46.200 --> 16:48.339
A few years ago, I...

16:48.370 --> 16:51.498
landed my first
recording deal.

16:51.540 --> 16:56.170
My...trumpet player
was like my brother.

16:56.210 --> 17:00.146
Andre Delphine.
(laughs)

17:00.180 --> 17:01.579
He was a monster
on the horn.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.547
We were in the studio...

17:05.590 --> 17:07.057
and we couldn't get
the horns right, you know?

17:07.090 --> 17:09.513
It just...sounded different

17:09.560 --> 17:11.027
than what I heard
in my head.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.925
We must have played it
a hundred times.

17:17.430 --> 17:19.625
Got really late,
but we finally nailed it.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.735
We were all pretty...
wiped out.

17:24.770 --> 17:27.978
Andre offered to just sleep
at the studio, but...

17:29.280 --> 17:31.077
I knew that he wanted
to get home to his family,

17:31.110 --> 17:33.249
so I insisted
on driving him home.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.584
Three miles from Andre's house,
I fell asleep.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.454
Hit a tree.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.788
Andre was killed instantly.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.635
You can't imagine what
it feels like to take a life.

18:03.010 --> 18:05.899
All that...
Bonnie and Clyde crap.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.139
Truth is, I've had enough
tragedy to last a lifetime.

18:14.190 --> 18:18.149
Your idea about a...

18:18.190 --> 18:20.920
quiet life in a little house
somewhere...

18:20.960 --> 18:23.292
(exhales)

18:23.330 --> 18:24.695
That's more like it.

18:29.370 --> 18:32.601
(dark music)

18:32.640 --> 18:39.603
*

18:39.650 --> 18:41.277
You need ice.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.814
I'll get it.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.774
Can I help you?

What--what's this about?

EDDIE: Thank you.

HARLEY: We're in the middle
of our set.

Next thing I know, Eddie is
leaning over Cubes' drum kit,

24:45.210 --> 24:46.802
puking his brains out.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.272
-(laughter)
-Rea|ly?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.878
True story.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.547
Then he gets up
and he keeps playing

24:51.590 --> 24:53.888
like nothing happened.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.480
-I'm a professional.
-(laughter)

HARLEY: That's what
they call it.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.623
And why do they
call you Cubes?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.958
I chew on ice cubes to relax.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.468
I mean, for a while
it was Ativan, but...

25:05.500 --> 25:07.058
this works better.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.330

-We've all mellowed with age.

25:09.370 --> 25:10.906

Eddie's never dated
a woman more than once.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.208
And now he brings
the lovely Teresa to dinner.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.474
And we're all_ the better
for It.

25:18.510 --> 25:19.977
Me especially.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.511
I don't know,
the only one of us

25:21.550 --> 25:24.280
that ever really settled
down was Andre.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.862

your own business.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.834
Yes. I have a bar
in New Orleans.

25:43.870 --> 25:46.907
And she has her own line
of tequila too.

25:46.940 --> 25:49.374
-Oh, yeah?
-Small, but growing.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.901
Why can't I meet
a woman like you?

get ready?

welcome.

the deer right away

40:10.000 --> 40:11.604
I can't be honest with you.

There are things
that you don't know, and...

40:14.940 --> 40:16.578
I can't see you anymore.

40:20.310 --> 40:21.618
What are you talking
about?

40:22.620 --> 40:25.817

we stop.

-No.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.149
