[music playing]

00:08.909 --> 00:09.777
Hey.

00:09.810 --> 00:10.778
What?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.380
- I gotta talk to you.
- Oh, come on.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.281
I had a rough night.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.915
I can't talk right now.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.350
Well, I can see why
you'd be tired being

00:16.384 --> 00:18.219
out with my wife all night.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.953
We went out for coffee.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.390
Yeah, well I don't want her
spending so much time with you.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.059
I mean, she sees you writing
poems and reading books

00:25.093 --> 00:29.330
and then she expects me to
be some kind of freak too.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.233
Mark, she does not
expect you to read.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.867
Yeah, well then
why is she asking me

00:33.901 --> 00:35.436
what I'm thinking about
every five minutes,

00:35.469 --> 00:38.038
like I'm thinking all the time.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.608
I'm sorry, are you
guys having problems?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.911
No, it's, I don't know.

00:43.944 --> 00:47.081
It's just we used to talk
a lot and lately it's

00:47.115 --> 00:48.916
as if we've got nothing
left to say to each other.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.722
What did you
used to talk about?

00:54.755 --> 00:57.458
I don't know, what
kind of car do you

00:57.491 --> 01:01.095
drive, what's your middle name.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.596
That's OK, Mark.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.365
Yeah, but if I keep asking
her what her middle name

01:04.398 --> 01:07.368
is, she's going to think
I'm some kind of idiot.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.470
You know, Mark,
any relationship

01:09.503 --> 01:10.838
goes through phases.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.840
And only by talking about your
feelings with each other can

01:12.873 --> 01:15.776
you ever get to the next level.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.979
So you're the one
she got that crap from.

01:19.012 --> 01:23.784
Mark, David, I need a hand.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.786
Water pipe burst and
the basement's flooded.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.054
Mark, go get my wrench.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.289
DJ, David's staying
with you tonight.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.590
No way.

01:29.623 --> 01:34.295
Darlene doesn't have to sleep
with him, how come I do?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.763
Oh, good, you can
stay in the basement.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.065
You'll finally get some use out
of those webbed toes of yours.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.233
David, you better
get down there

01:39.267 --> 01:40.334
and get the rest of your stuff.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.236
You should have to
move into the garage.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.905
You're not really a member
of this family anyway.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.840
Young man, I don't
ever want to hear

01:46.874 --> 01:48.942
you talking like that again.

01:48.976 --> 01:52.446
If he moves in the garage, I
might have to move my tools.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.748
You better pray I fall
asleep before you do.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.321
You want me to help you get
you stuff from downstairs?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.390
I'll do it later.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.457
Is something wrong?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.661
I don't know.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.563
Maybe I just need to get
away from this house.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.631
Oh, that.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.200
That's just a phase.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.501
You won't get over it.

02:13.534 --> 02:17.638
You want to talk about it?

02:17.671 --> 02:19.640
No, I can't tell
you of all people.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.409
It's much too disgusting.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.577
You'd think I was a total creep.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.213
Oh, come on,
David, we're friends.

02:25.246 --> 02:29.183
I mean, if something's
upsetting you, you can tell me.

02:29.217 --> 02:32.786
Last night after we
got back, I had a dream

02:32.820 --> 02:34.688
and it kind of disturbed me.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.924
You mean like a nightmare?

02:36.957 --> 02:41.028
No, it was more
like an adult dream.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.001
You mean about Darlene?

02:48.035 --> 02:50.003
No, not Darlene.

02:50.037 --> 02:50.838
Oh.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.742
Oh, wow.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.177
Yeah, look, I feel really
uncomfortable talking

02:57.211 --> 02:58.546
to you about this.

02:58.579 --> 03:02.483
David, I mean it's not
like you did anything.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.353
In a way, it's
kind of flattering.

03:09.423 --> 03:13.160
What the hell are you
doing holding my wife's hand?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.061
Hand?

03:14.094 --> 03:15.429
No, hand.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.831
She was just making
me feel better.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.367
Why don't you just
ask her for a lap dance?

03:22.236 --> 03:24.405
Could you possibly
be more boorish?

03:24.438 --> 03:28.676
Well, I'm sorry I'm
boring you, Becky.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.312
What the hell are you
doing holding his hand?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.145
Like you care.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.386
She loves you so much.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.822
[music playing]

04:27.234 --> 04:30.638
How 'bout some
blueberry pancakes?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.539
From scratch?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.407
I'll get the bowl.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.009
Soon as I finish my
coffee, I'll go to the store

04:36.043 --> 04:37.345
and get the blueberries.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.383
You're sleeping on
the floor again tonight.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.817
That's not fair, DJ.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.818
You know what?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.020
I don't care.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.556
Mrs. Conner, help me out here.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.190
Aren't we supposed to
rotate who gets the bed

04:50.223 --> 04:51.425
and who has to
sleep on the floor?

04:51.459 --> 04:55.563
That's right, DJ,
just like your dad I do.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.664
This sucks.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.432
Why an I always the
one stuck with David?

04:58.466 --> 04:59.967
Well, fair's fair, DJ.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.370
We wrote your name on a whole
bunch of pieces of paper

05:02.403 --> 05:04.472
and we put them in a hat and
then when we drew one out,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.407
it said your name on it.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.742
Come on, DJ.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.077
Having a roommate can be great.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.145
The years I spent growing up
in the same room with your mom

05:12.179 --> 05:16.517
are the happiest
memories of my life.

05:16.550 --> 05:22.155
Sybil, can you have
Jackie come out now?

05:22.189 --> 05:26.594
I hate way you chew your food.

05:26.627 --> 05:31.832
It's all right, I won't
be staying here much longer.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.101
I made a decision I'm going
to move out of the house.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.336
What a coincidence.
I made a decision too.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.038
No, you're not.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.307
I've been thinking about
getting my own apartment.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.109
I just think it's time.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.844
Well, time is a
funny thing, David,

05:43.877 --> 05:46.246
and it passes very
slowly when you're

05:46.279 --> 05:50.618
pinned under Mr. Conner's
massive frame, right Dan?

05:50.651 --> 05:51.519
Dan hurt, David.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.491
Wait a second, David,
you can't move out

05:57.525 --> 05:59.026
just because of the other day.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.261
No, I can't live here with
things the way they are.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.763
What do you mean
the way they are?

06:02.796 --> 06:03.931
It's nothing, Mother.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.500
Dan, Becky knows
something that I don't know.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.001
Becky, you can't
know something

06:08.035 --> 06:11.071
your mother doesn't know.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.073
I don't think David
wants you to find out.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.408
That's ridiculous.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.143
If he has something he doesn't
want me to find out about,

06:16.176 --> 06:20.848
then he should not be discussing
it with anyone on my planet.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.115
It's not a big deal.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.484
David is just feeling
weird because he

06:23.517 --> 06:26.687
had this big dream about me
and him, you know, together.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.027
And the two of you were
being chased by a bear?

06:34.061 --> 06:39.633
No, Dan, my guess is
they were having sex.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.401
Oh, God.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.604
I should have known you
couldn't deal with this.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.739
I will handle it,
just leave it alone.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.009
Man, oh, man, David and Becky.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.944
We got us a problem
here, Roseanne.

06:50.978 --> 06:55.215
Yeah, what if Mark
won't bow out gracefully?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.118
He's fantasizing about his
brother's wife, for God's sake.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.888
Calm down, it's not
like he ate the last piece

07:00.921 --> 07:02.355
of pie or nothing.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.024
This is serious.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.727
If he's dreaming it, he's going
to try and make it happen.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.061
Oh, right.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.197
That reminds me, I'd better
get down to the supermarket

07:10.230 --> 07:11.532
so I can walk around naked.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.574
Look, he's a
horny teenage boy.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.942
Now if he wants to
move out of the house,

07:21.975 --> 07:24.978
I think we should let
him just to be safe.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.748
We cannot control
our kids' dreams, Dan.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.585
We can only make sure
they don't come true.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.253
Can I say something?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.323
A dream like this
can be interpreted

07:36.356 --> 07:37.958
in so many different ways.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.661
We don't know what
kind of sex it was.

07:40.694 --> 07:44.965
We don't know where
the sex took place.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.133
How many people were involved.

07:49.069 --> 07:54.007
My point is that sex
dreams are rarely about sex.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.110
Quite often, they are merely
a yearning for affection.

07:57.144 --> 08:03.483
David could be longing for
a puppy or a kind word.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.318
But in the dream
state, this desire

08:05.352 --> 08:10.057
takes the form of well,
intercourse with Becky.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.392
Look, Jackie, you
made a brand new vein

08:12.425 --> 08:15.729
stand out on Dan's head.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.198
We're not done
talking about this.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.701
Man, I saw this coming.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.502
All these unrelated
kids under one roof.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.503
It's an abomination.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.640
We're breaking like
50 commandments.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.408
Well, that would explain
the flood in the basement.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.645
[music playing]

08:46.126 --> 08:49.597
Why are you
always following me?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.664
What?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.666
You know, you're
in my room all night.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.836
Now you have to follow
me around all day too?

08:55.869 --> 08:56.837
What are you talking about?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.738
I was here first.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.406
No, I was here first.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.574
You were not.

09:00.608 --> 09:04.745
I've been here since
1981 when I was born.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.179
Both of ya, shut up.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.921
Why do you have
to sit so close?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.125
I'm not.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.193
You're always
hanging around me.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.229
You in love with me now
like you are with Becky?

09:22.262 --> 09:25.465
Shut up.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.034
What are you
guys talking about?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.302
I heard Becky telling
Mom and Dad that David

09:29.336 --> 09:31.471
had sex dream about her.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.709
What?

09:35.743 --> 09:38.245
No, listen, man, this
is not what you think.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.613
That's bull.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.948
You want to sleep with my wife.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.316
Let him, I want my room back.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.087
Get up.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.893
I've been working
out, you know.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.595
Fight, fight.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.230
What's going on?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.365
Mark's killing David.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.433
Oh, God.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.702
What are you
dreaming about my wife?

10:01.735 --> 10:02.703
Nothing.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.471
What are you
dreaming about Becky?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.506
So Darlene dumped you and
you thought you could take

10:06.539 --> 10:07.775
a crack at my wife, is that it?

10:07.808 --> 10:08.809
No, no.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.043
Then why are you
dreaming about her for?

10:10.077 --> 10:10.944
I'm not.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.145
Liar.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.714
Look, I didn't have a
sex dream about Becky, OK?

10:13.747 --> 10:14.614
I didn't.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.283
I had a dream about Mrs. Conner.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.525
Now can we put him
back in the basement?

10:30.597 --> 10:33.266
Look at this, he is
serious about moving out.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.736
Look, David circled
apartment ads.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.305
So what, that could be
any of my kids or Dan.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.945
If you want, I could talk to
the boy about his Becky dreams.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.614
I think this really ought to
be handled with a little bit

10:47.647 --> 10:50.183
of sensitivity.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.520
David, I was just
thinking about you.

10:53.553 --> 10:57.190
Well, I wasn't thinking
about you, I swear.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.225
Be gentle with him.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.059
I know!

11:01.995 --> 11:05.065
Look, David, I don't want to
make you feel uncomfortable,

11:05.098 --> 11:08.401
but you know I want you to know
that we are like totally OK

11:08.435 --> 11:09.236
with this dream.

11:12.272 --> 11:16.944
Well, I'm uncomfortable,
I'm very uncomfortable now.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.011
Maybe I can help.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.947
David, what Mrs.
Conner is trying to say

11:19.980 --> 11:24.551
is that this dream does
not bother her at all.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.685
Really?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.020
So you're not mad?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.188
Makes perfect sense.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.556
You see her all day.

11:29.589 --> 11:33.393
You smell her perfume, you brush
up against her in the halls.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.064
Bound to happen
sooner or later.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.732
I thought you'd be disgusted.

11:38.766 --> 11:43.470
No, you're a perfectly
healthy adolescent boy.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.905
Don't think you're
the only kid that

11:44.938 --> 11:46.006
has had these kind of thoughts.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.640
Why do you think all
DJ's little friends

11:47.674 --> 11:48.742
always want to sleep over?

11:51.611 --> 11:54.514
It's a part of life, David.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.916
I mean, you're a
good looking kid.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.384
She may have dreams about you.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.218
Sure.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.161
What's going on?

12:08.195 --> 12:11.098
Oh, OK, I feel
better, I can go now.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.800
Oh, we just want to
tell David that we're all

12:12.833 --> 12:16.436
OK with this dream, right Dan?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.105
Well, if you say so.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.174
I mean, you know, the
only important thing

12:21.208 --> 12:25.478
is that you're not considering
acting on your impulses.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.215
I would never.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.482
Ever, ever.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.619
I mean, we are talking
about a married woman here.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.987
Jackie, Roseanne,
can I see you

12:34.021 --> 12:37.257
in the kitchen for a minute?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.591
Why?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.760
Did you get your water dish
stuck under the stove again?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.519
Rosie, you OK?

13:06.553 --> 13:07.620
No, I'm not OK.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.589
This is horrible, what
are we going to do?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.124
What choice do we have?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.159
You got to give yourself to him.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.796
It's not funny, Dan.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.965
How'm I gonna go
out there and face

13:17.998 --> 13:20.133
him when I know he's
probably picturing

13:20.167 --> 13:23.470
me in my terrycloth robe.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.972
Just ignore him.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.942
Then he'll think I'm
playing hard to get.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.045
Come on, Roseanne,
it's just a stupid dream.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.015
When you thought he was dreaming
about Becky it was no big deal.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.749
Yeah, because there's
no threat with Becky.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.786
She's a happily married woman.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.255
OK, OK, if this is
such a problem for you,

13:42.289 --> 13:43.590
maybe David should move out.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.958
Where could he go?

13:44.992 --> 13:48.728
The only place take him in'd
put him to sleep in five days.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.964
Honey, you're overreacting.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.933
It's perfectly normal
for a teenage boy

13:52.966 --> 13:56.036
to have sex dreams about
his girlfriend's mother.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.237
I mean even Mark might have--

13:57.270 --> 14:00.807
You finish that sentence,
I'll rip your heart out.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.010
Someone's sensitive.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.112
Well, how come when you
thought it was about Becky

14:05.145 --> 14:07.915
you're so upset, and then when
it turns out to be about me,

14:07.948 --> 14:11.084
you think it's so funny?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.385
OK, I'm going to
tell you something.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.521
And I want you to keep in mind,
the reason I'm telling you

14:14.554 --> 14:16.256
this is to show
how normal David is

14:16.289 --> 14:19.592
and not that I'm
some kind of freak.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.995
What, what is it?

14:22.029 --> 14:28.435
OK, when we were dating I
had a dream, a very short one

14:28.468 --> 14:29.336
about your mother.

14:29.369 --> 14:36.143
Oh, that's disgusting, Dan.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.844
How could you compare
the beautiful thing

14:37.877 --> 14:41.714
David and I have to that?

14:41.748 --> 14:44.151
Roseanne, you can't go
and tell anyone about this.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.553
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.588
So this is just like
all teenage boys

14:48.621 --> 14:50.723
have these kind of dreams about
their girlfriends' mothers?

14:50.757 --> 14:53.126
Well, girlfriends'
mothers, their mothers'

14:53.160 --> 14:57.564
friends, their friends'
girlfriends, all the girls

14:57.597 --> 14:59.732
on the block.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.535
All the girls on TV.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.038
All the rest of them.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.439
Men are so sick.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.308
Oh, come on, don't women
dream about their boyfriends'

15:08.341 --> 15:09.276
fathers?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.743
No, Dan.

15:10.777 --> 15:15.815
Unlike men, women do not have
to be disgusted to get excited.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.624
No, David, you're not
dreaming, I'm really here.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.863
Mrs. Conner, listen, I really
want to apologize to you.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.665
You have to know that I
would never think of anything

15:32.699 --> 15:34.367
like that when I was awake.
- David.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.568
The whole idea
is just so gross.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.904
OK, stop right now.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.373
That was just a dream which
you could not control,

15:40.407 --> 15:44.044
unlike what you are
saying to me now.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.546
I'm sorry, I don't
know what I'm saying.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.880
I'm the worst
person in the world.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.416
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.750
I'm sick.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.653
No, you're not sick, David,
you're a normal teenage boy.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.723
But I can understand how
you get the two confused.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.358
This is not normal.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.892
Yes it is.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.563
A lot of guys
fantasize about older

16:03.596 --> 16:05.598
women that are really hot.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.768
Where'd you hear that?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.705
Well, you got to
promise not to tell.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.878
I saw it on Oprah.

16:18.911 --> 16:19.779
Really?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.714
Yeah, yeah.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.016
Yeah, they had
this guy on there.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.386
You know, a big guy, real
kind of macho blue collar

16:26.419 --> 16:28.855
type of guy, you know,
not much to look at.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.159
But for some reason, he had
this incredibly gorgeous wife,

16:32.192 --> 16:33.293
you know?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.829
And he said he had these
dreams about her mother.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.866
And her mother
was a big ol' hag.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.568
This was different.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.969
How?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.837
Because that guy was talking
about his girlfriend's mother.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.507
And I just, I don't think
of you that way anymore.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.408
You don't?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.309
No.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.377
I mean, I think of you as--

16:50.410 --> 16:51.211
What?

16:54.247 --> 16:58.985
I kind of think of you
as, you know, my own mother.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.287
Oh, you do?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.555
Well, yeah, and I've
lived here what, two years,

17:02.589 --> 17:06.293
and you've taken better care of
me than my own mother ever did.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.995
David, I think it's great that
you think of me as your mother.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.397
No, see.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.400
I mean, it just makes this whole
dream thing much, much worse.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.235
No, no it doesn't, David.

17:15.268 --> 17:20.240
Because, you know, sex
dreams, they're really

17:20.273 --> 17:22.875
rarely ever about sex anyway.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.678
You know, maybe you're just
feeling like you want a puppy.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.619
Where did you get that?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.121
From the Oprah show.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.124
You know, well we had
this woman on the panel

17:37.157 --> 17:39.459
right next to that big
guy, you know, this kind

17:39.492 --> 17:40.893
of skinny expert type.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.763
Reminded me of
Barney Fife actually.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.665
And she said that, you
know, sex dreams are

17:45.698 --> 17:47.200
really not about
sex, they're just

17:47.234 --> 17:50.637
about yearning for affection.

17:53.072 --> 17:53.940
Really?

17:53.973 --> 17:55.808
Yeah.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.478
And do you think she knew
what she was talking about?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.846
Well, she was
an expert, David.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.885
Mrs. Is Conner, I
can't tell you how

18:05.918 --> 18:08.655
much better that makes me feel.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.290
That's good, that's great.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.160
OK, so well can I have
a hug now or what, do

18:13.193 --> 18:14.194
I got to get you drunk first?

18:17.497 --> 18:20.567
I'm so glad that you think
about me as your mother.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.435
I really do, Mrs. Conner.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.909
Do you want me to
start calling you Mom?

18:29.942 --> 18:34.614
No, I'd like the other kids
to start calling me Mrs. Conner.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.222
[music playing]

18:42.255 --> 18:43.723
I told you when you
moved in you were going

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
to have trouble with the pipes.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.961
Yeah, and 20 years
later it happens.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.062
Eerie.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.931
Hi, Becky.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.333
Hey, Grandma, hey Mom.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.734
Is David around?

18:54.767 --> 18:57.737
Becky, hold on a sec.

18:57.770 --> 19:04.010
Mom, DJ made you the cutest
little ashtray upstairs.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.745
You really should go up
there and take a look at it.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.079
I don't smoke.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.816
I know that, but he does.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.386
Why don't you go up there and
take a look at the ashtray?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.191
OK, Roseanne.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.460
I'll play along.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.630
I will now leave you and
Becky alone as I go to DJ's

19:23.663 --> 19:25.798
room to look at the ashtray.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.735
I have such fun in your little
kingdom of make believe.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.573
What's going on?

19:33.606 --> 19:37.344
Well, I talked to
David about his dream.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.745
I knew it.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.380
You always have to butt in on
things that aren't about you.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.848
This is between him and me.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.650
The dream was about me.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.917
What?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.020
Yeah, it seems that I'm
what all the teenage boys are

19:48.054 --> 19:49.256
into this year.

19:52.325 --> 19:56.062
Oh, guess it's
pretty silly of me

19:56.095 --> 19:58.831
to think that it could have
possibly been about me.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.767
Well, don't feel bad, Becky.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.169
Someday you'll fill
out too, and then

20:03.202 --> 20:05.472
all the boys will want you.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.907
Shut up, Mother.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.243
Is there something going
on between you and David ?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.511
No, there's nothing going on.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.779
Well, let me put
it a different way.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.013
Would you like there to be?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.785
I don't know.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.154
I mean, I didn't until well,
we had that dream about me

20:22.188 --> 20:24.090
or thought he did.

20:24.123 --> 20:28.795
And now I feel kind
of, I don't know.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.799
Does anything in the
stupid category come to mind?

20:32.832 --> 20:34.534
Look, I don't need your
help with this, Mother.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.436
I can deal with this myself.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.504
Deal with what yourself?

20:37.537 --> 20:40.172
Nothing.

20:40.206 --> 20:44.010
Forget it, I didn't
want to know anyway.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.979
OK, she's gone, you can tell me.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.148
No, Dan, she trusted me
with something private.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.883
I thought you would
appreciate the fact

20:50.917 --> 20:52.919
that I can keep a confidence.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.488
I saw Becky leave the
kitchen, so I suppose I'm

20:55.522 --> 20:56.789
done looking at the ashtray.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.028
Mother Harris.

21:02.061 --> 21:07.199
Oh, Dan, I know you've been
doing some plumbing around here

21:07.233 --> 21:10.236
and I was thinking while you're
still in the monkey wrench

21:10.269 --> 21:13.373
mood, you might come
by tomorrow and put

21:13.406 --> 21:15.742
in my new garbage disposal?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.777
OK, Bev, I could do that.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.779
Oh, wonderful,
then it's a date.

21:19.812 --> 21:20.613
See you tomorrow.

21:23.716 --> 21:27.954
And after you're done with the
disposal, I was thinking you

21:27.987 --> 21:30.256
and I could have some sex.

21:43.436 --> 21:48.007
[music playing]
