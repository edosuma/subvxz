17:57.317 --> 17:58.883
What happened between you and Nick?

17:58.885 --> 18:00.218
It was a misunderstanding.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.486
About what?

18:01.488 --> 18:02.687
The witches.

18:02.689 --> 18:04.589
I was wrong about
letting them stay here.

18:04.591 --> 18:06.390
They'll be gone in a few hours.

18:06.392 --> 18:07.558

18:07.560 --> 18:09.660
We go back to the way things were, Clay.

18:09.662 --> 18:12.897
Elena's feelings for
that girl are a problem.

18:12.899 --> 18:15.199
She wants to protect her.
She's obsessed.

18:15.201 --> 18:18.502
I have faith in Elena's ability
to put the Pack first.

18:20.605 --> 18:23.307

Oh, it was from Paige.

18:35.587 --> 18:38.655
She said I could keep it after.

18:38.657 --> 18:42.692
Ruth and Paige, they...
they care a lot about you.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.694

18:46.330 --> 18:48.632

18:51.569 --> 18:52.902
Yeah, I do.

18:52.904 --> 18:54.137
Well, we can't delay.

18:54.139 --> 18:55.471
I'll get my things.

18:57.707 --> 19:00.143
Paige.

19:00.145 --> 19:02.512
Before we go...

19:02.514 --> 19:03.812
I have to ask you...

19:05.749 --> 19:08.884
The way that Savannah can't control
her magic, is that normal?

19:13.322 --> 19:16.025
It's a powerful force.

19:16.027 --> 19:18.193
She's like a grenade
with the pin pulled.

19:18.195 --> 19:20.295
You throw it in the right
direction, everything's okay.

19:20.297 --> 19:21.430
And if not...

19:21.432 --> 19:23.365
But how out-of-control can it get?

19:25.101 --> 19:27.235
Can it affect other people?

19:28.771 --> 19:30.572
Why? What's going on?

19:32.308 --> 19:34.276
Clay: At the compound, she was...

19:34.278 --> 19:36.111
forced to Change.

19:36.113 --> 19:39.614
In front of people.
It's really thrown her.

19:39.616 --> 19:41.583
That's an incredible violation.

19:43.852 --> 19:45.887
But she never has to see
those people again.

19:45.889 --> 19:48.089
And they will not remember seeing her.

19:48.091 --> 19:49.857
One will.

19:49.859 --> 19:51.258
One of them was Rachel.

19:53.428 --> 19:55.597
Elena never told me that.

19:55.599 --> 19:57.030
She didn't?

20:02.437 --> 20:06.574
Why would she keep it a secret
if it wasn't troubling her?

20:06.576 --> 20:09.676
I think this relationship
with Savannah, she's...

20:09.678 --> 20:12.246
she's trying to find
the good in what happened.

20:15.349 --> 20:18.551
And you're worried that the more
time she spends with this girl...

20:20.387 --> 20:23.556
the harder it will be for her to
deal with what's really wrong.

20:23.558 --> 20:25.692
The ceremony only deepens their bond.

It's your decision, Jeremy.
I only thought you should know.

has something to do with it?

how a... a dark witch

can enter someone else's

25:21.530 --> 25:23.263
are me and Rachel...

Aleister. We found his symbol

30:12.757 --> 30:14.357
in a shack on the property.

30:14.359 --> 30:16.392
But he's dead.

30:16.394 --> 30:19.395
We think that Aleister's still alive...

30:19.397 --> 30:22.197
and that he has possessed Clay
to take Savannah.

30:24.801 --> 30:27.636
We have to find Aleister's body.

30:27.638 --> 30:29.772
He's going to try and kill Clay

30:29.774 --> 30:32.508
within a dark circle that
he's drawn on the floor.

30:32.510 --> 30:35.411
If you can kill Clay's
body outside the circle,

30:35.413 --> 30:38.046
it will trap Aleister's spirit

30:38.048 --> 30:39.381
and he'll die.

30:39.383 --> 30:44.052
H... h... how do we kill the
body and not hurt Clay?

30:44.054 --> 30:45.220
You can't.

30:45.222 --> 30:47.789
Ruth, there has to be a way.

30:47.791 --> 30:49.491
Believe me,

30:49.493 --> 30:50.725
if there was another way,

30:50.727 --> 30:52.427
we would be doing it.

30:52.429 --> 30:55.329
This is a very, very dark magic.

30:55.331 --> 30:58.833
There's no coming back from it.

30:58.835 --> 31:02.570
Possession spells are always
fatal to those possessed.

31:05.007 --> 31:07.074
I'm so sorry.

31:07.076 --> 31:09.443
I am not giving up on Clay!

31:09.445 --> 31:12.213
Listen to me, Jeremy.

31:12.215 --> 31:16.117
The man you love is already gone.

31:16.119 --> 31:19.186
Clay is already dead.

31:19.188 --> 31:21.222
No one can bring him back.

31:21.224 --> 31:24.691
You're asking me to kill my son, Ruth.

31:24.693 --> 31:27.895

are about to go through.

There's an old foundry
right down that road.

That's where he's going
to draw the dark circle.

32:30.458 --> 32:31.756
Elena: Jeremy,

32:31.758 --> 32:34.425
did Ruth tell you how we get Clay back?

33:57.807 --> 33:59.007

33:59.009 --> 34:00.742
His scent is here, but it's weak.

34:00.744 --> 34:03.312
We need to split up. How do we stop him?

34:03.314 --> 34:06.282
I don't want either of you
to do what needs to be done.

34:06.284 --> 34:08.417
Find him and I'll finish this.

34:08.418 --> 34:10.119
Hey. Jeremy,

34:10.121 --> 34:12.320
what aren't you telling us?

34:12.322 --> 34:15.090
(Sigh)

34:15.092 --> 34:16.925
You're hiding something from us,

34:16.927 --> 34:19.226
I can see it.

34:19.228 --> 34:23.398
Clay... as we know him, is gone.

34:23.400 --> 34:27.302
- What do you mean?
- The possession spell is fatal.

34:27.304 --> 34:30.638
Ruth made it very clear, it's dark magic.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.773
When Aleister took over his body,

34:32.775 --> 34:34.875
he destroyed Clay's soul.

34:36.411 --> 34:38.980
No. No, I don't believe her.

34:38.982 --> 34:43.050
Jeremy: If there was any other
option, we'd be taking it.

34:43.052 --> 34:46.553
He's gone. And the only way
for us to stop Aleister now

34:46.554 --> 34:50.257
- is to kill Clay.
- Jeremy, that is not going to happen.

34:50.259 --> 34:51.692
What if we find Aleister's body

34:51.694 --> 34:52.960
and just kill it instead?

34:52.962 --> 34:54.762
It's not going to bring Clay back.

34:54.764 --> 34:56.263
That would just lock Aleister

34:56.264 --> 34:58.499
in Clay's body forever.

34:58.501 --> 35:00.167
Then we do that.

35:00.169 --> 35:02.702
We trap him, we hold him in the cage,

35:02.704 --> 35:03.970
and we wait.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.241
Clay's strong, Jeremy,

35:07.243 --> 35:10.076
he can fight this, okay?

35:10.078 --> 35:11.711
I know he can! He will!

35:11.713 --> 35:15.815
It's not going to be Clay in that cage.

35:15.817 --> 35:19.285
And you're going to wait
for the rest of your life,

35:19.287 --> 35:20.920
but he's gone, Elena.

35:22.289 --> 35:24.557
Clay's dead...

35:24.559 --> 35:27.794
and we have to accept that.

35:27.796 --> 35:31.064
We've lost him and I'm sorry.

35:31.066 --> 35:34.066
- Stay here, I will deal with this alone.
Nick: - No.

35:34.068 --> 35:36.169
If Aleister killed my brother,

35:36.171 --> 35:39.038
then he needs to die.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.005
You tell me how.

If you find him, you take him
out of the circle he's in
