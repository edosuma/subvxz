00:12.960 --> 00:16.790
Delivery day is the worst.

00:16.830 --> 00:20.100
It takes so long for
you to lug everything inside

00:20.130 --> 00:22.400
while I stand guard.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.440
You know, I can't imagine

00:25.470 --> 00:27.400
why you would give yourself
such a tough job.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.110
Yep, it's pretty grueling.
I'm not gonna lie.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.810
Ah, brain freeze!

00:33.840 --> 00:35.480
See?

00:37.210 --> 00:39.980
Oh, here come the lovebirds.

00:46.820 --> 00:49.260
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe it.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.260
Did you just see Justin take those flowers?

00:51.290 --> 00:52.860
I don't know what he was thinking.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.230
He's allergic to flowers.
He's gonna lean in for a kiss,

00:55.260 --> 00:57.100
and then sneeze and give her a headbutt.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.630
Justin.

00:58.670 --> 01:02.470
I saw you take those flowers
without paying for them.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.810
You've never stolen anything in your life.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.240
Correction, he's stolen my heart.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.010
Yeah, so stay out of it...

01:11.180 --> 01:13.350
...Alex!

01:15.050 --> 01:16.550
Hey.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.690
What's going on?

01:19.720 --> 01:21.660
Eh... I don't want
to tattle.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.630
Harper, you tell dad that
Justin just stole those flowers

01:24.660 --> 01:26.730
- to give to Rosie.
- What?

01:26.760 --> 01:28.800
I wanted to tattle.
Thanks.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.300
Stealing?

01:30.330 --> 01:32.140
That doesn't sound like you, Justin.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.070
You won't even use
the bathrooms at our restaurant

01:34.100 --> 01:35.640
unless you buy something first.

01:35.670 --> 01:39.340
Oh, big deal, I stole something
that grows out of the ground.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.980
Come on, Rosie. It's just
no more fun. Let's bounce.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.250
See, dad?
He's acting weird.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.320
Yeah.
And Rosie's an angel.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.520
It doesn't make sense.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.360
Just being around her, he
should be influenced to do good.

01:56.390 --> 01:58.190
Maybe you should find out what's going on.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.230
And how am I gonna do that?

02:00.260 --> 02:03.000
I don't know. Maybe you should
talk to some guardian angels.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.470
Come on, dad, how am I
gonna find an entrance

02:05.500 --> 02:07.040
to the angel world?
They're hidden.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.970
Yeah, but they're always near something

02:10.009 --> 02:11.580
that has to do with angels.

02:11.610 --> 02:16.450
Mysterious, yet obvious.
I am on it.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.480
Come on, Harper.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.620
These boxes aren't gonna
move inside by themselves.

02:28.890 --> 02:31.090
I'm gonna sit guard.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.190
That was Mr. Laritate.

03:39.230 --> 03:41.590
He wants to know when Max
is returning to school.

03:41.630 --> 03:45.430
How are we gonna send Max 
to school if he's still Maxine?

03:45.470 --> 03:48.300
Does he really need to go?

03:48.340 --> 03:51.170
Okay, one bit coming up.

03:51.210 --> 03:54.310
Hey, mom, how do you spell bit?

03:56.110 --> 03:58.450
Yeah, he needs to go to school.

04:07.690 --> 04:10.790
Hallelujah angel food cake company.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.290
All right, here it is.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.360
Hello?

04:27.170 --> 04:30.310
Hello?

04:30.340 --> 04:32.010
Uh, what are you doing?

04:33.750 --> 04:36.420
Uh, official...

04:36.450 --> 04:39.180
...City...
Brick checker.

04:39.220 --> 04:41.890
So, everything seems to be in order.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.460
You're worried about somebody, huh?

04:45.490 --> 04:48.030
What? No.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.860
Yes, you are.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.300
And it's your brother.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.540
How do you know that?

04:54.570 --> 04:57.040
I can feel it.

04:57.070 --> 04:58.870
Who are you?

04:58.910 --> 05:01.880
I'm Tina, a guardian angel in training.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.510
And I know you're a wizard.

05:04.550 --> 05:05.980
You can feel that, too?

05:06.010 --> 05:09.550
No, I can see your wand
sticking out of your boot.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.020
You know, I'm surprised
more people don't notice that.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.850
I really am.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.950
All right, Tina, can you show me

05:15.990 --> 05:18.060
where the guardian angel
dispatch center is?

05:18.090 --> 05:21.190
Can I?
I would love to!

05:21.260 --> 05:23.330
Oh, I finally get to help somebody.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.000
Usually people don't let me help
because they say I'm too young, and...

05:26.030 --> 05:27.570
Ok.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.230
I guess I should've started
with "I'm in a hurry."

05:29.270 --> 05:30.770
Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.870
This just really means a lot to me.

05:32.910 --> 05:35.440
And the door is right here.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.180
Oh. It's kinda bright.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.780
Not very subtle for a hidden location.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.850
You couldn't find it.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.690
That is a good point.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.990
Yeah.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.390
Well, we have to hurry up,

05:48.420 --> 05:51.290
'cause the light attracts moths,
so just squint and run.

05:51.330 --> 05:53.260
No, I don't run.

06:04.470 --> 06:07.640
So, this is where all the calls come in

06:07.670 --> 06:10.110
and guardian angels are
dispatched to help people

06:10.140 --> 06:11.380
all over the world.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.250
And these are the poles they slide down.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.820
Ooh, that is the moral compass,

06:17.850 --> 06:20.090
and this is our air hockey table.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.150
Oh, my gosh.
Air hockey.

06:22.190 --> 06:24.320
If I so wasn't into helping my brother

06:24.360 --> 06:26.060
I'd wipe the table with these guys.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.760
All right, so what's this
moral compass thingy do?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.430
It looks like
a grown-up clock.

06:31.470 --> 06:33.300
You know, the ones without the numbers.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.100
Well, when it's pointed to "good,"

06:35.140 --> 06:37.310
it gives guardian angels
the power to help people

06:37.340 --> 06:38.770
make good choices.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.480
What if it's
pointed to "bad?"

06:40.510 --> 06:43.710
Well, that could only happen if
the angels of darkness take over.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.220
Then everyone everywhere would
act terrible to each other.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.120
Man, that's a scary thought.
Whoo, did you get a shiver?

06:51.150 --> 06:53.920
Hey, Tina.
Did you just go outside

06:53.960 --> 06:55.760
and sniff out somebody in trouble?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.830
Yeah, I sure did!

06:57.860 --> 06:59.900
I'm impressed with your enthusiasm,

06:59.930 --> 07:02.700
but I'm a little tired
of asking you time and time

07:02.730 --> 07:06.200
and time and time and time and
time again to stop doing that.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.340
Oh, hold on.

07:09.370 --> 07:12.380
Guardian angel dispatch.
What's the trouble?

07:12.410 --> 07:13.610
Oh.

07:14.780 --> 07:18.320
Angel 51, see the boy
about to give a wedgie.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.990
Hey, let me take that one.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.420
It'll help me get my wings.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.520
Come on. Please?
Please? Please?

07:25.560 --> 07:28.060
Tina, you know what happens to angels

07:28.090 --> 07:29.690
who get their wings before they're ready?

07:29.730 --> 07:31.560
- What?
- I don't know.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.700
Because nobody gets their wings
before they're ready.

07:33.730 --> 07:36.130
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt,

07:36.170 --> 07:38.470
but my brother is suddenly acting bad.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.200
And the weird part is that
his girlfriend is an angel.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.470
I mean, shouldn't she be steering
him to make good choices?

07:43.510 --> 07:45.210
Well, that's what angels do

07:45.240 --> 07:47.410
when they're not out looking for trouble.

07:49.210 --> 07:52.250
How about I dispatch a guardian angel

07:52.280 --> 07:55.520
- to check on your brother?
- Yes, please, thank you.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.220
Monty, you're up.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.920
Thanks, monty.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.260
Oh, he's kind of cute.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.100
All right, well, thanks little
guardian-angel-in-training.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.560
Good luck getting
your wings. I'm out.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.230
Wait, I can help more.
Just let me come with you.

08:11.270 --> 08:13.100
Please? Please? Please?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.840
No. No. No.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.780
I think I just made a new friend.

08:29.990 --> 08:34.220
So, you see, the reason
Max isn't here is because

08:34.260 --> 08:37.890
he's participating in the russo
cousin exchange program.

08:37.929 --> 08:40.929
We've been doing it for
generations, right, Jerry?

08:40.970 --> 08:43.200
So, you exchanged Max,

08:43.230 --> 08:45.070
but you didn't exchange Alex?

08:46.570 --> 08:48.810
Feels like a lost opportunity.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.240
We just talked to Max,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.210
and he is having a great time

08:55.250 --> 08:57.450
on the russo farm in...

08:57.480 --> 09:00.820
...Fargo, north Dakota.

09:02.050 --> 09:04.060
And little Maxine here, she can't wait

09:04.090 --> 09:06.220
to live the life of a big city gal.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.830
Isn't that right, Maxine?

09:07.860 --> 09:10.130
That's right, aunt.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.400
Well, it's a pleasure to have
another odd russo kid

09:13.430 --> 09:14.900
running around the place.

09:14.940 --> 09:16.800
Welcome to the fourth grade, little Lassie.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.640
Will I have to have
Mrs. bialato again?

09:19.670 --> 09:21.980
Whoa, ho, ho.

09:22.010 --> 09:25.480
Carry that back to old virginny.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.180
How do you know
about Mrs. bialato

09:29.220 --> 09:31.650
if you're from north Dakota?

09:31.690 --> 09:34.390
Because... because

09:34.460 --> 09:38.260
there is a miss bialato in every school.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.160
Right? Huh?

09:40.190 --> 09:42.060
You know what I'm sayin'.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.660
Please say you know what I'm sayin'.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.370
Ah, you mean the kind of teacher

09:48.400 --> 09:51.740
who gives certain glances
and giggles at all your jokes.

09:51.770 --> 09:54.940
But then you realize it's
only at teacher review time.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.710
Then after she gets her good review,

09:56.740 --> 09:59.440
all she does is bark at you
about the broken copier?

10:00.980 --> 10:03.150
Yeah, I get that.

10:07.450 --> 10:09.860
Hey, it's eddy g.
And the guys.

10:09.890 --> 10:12.220
Hello.
What's up, guys?

10:12.260 --> 10:15.530
Wanna play some zombie circus
later and own some noobs?

10:17.560 --> 10:19.900
- Guys?
- Max.

10:19.930 --> 10:22.070
Max, those are your old friends.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.900
You have to try to fit in with
the girls in the fourth grade.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.610
How am I supposed to do that?

10:26.640 --> 10:29.010
I don't know one fourth grade
girl who can own a noob.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.840
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Harper.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.240
Can you help Max fit in?

10:32.280 --> 10:33.380
Oh, sure. Ok.

10:33.410 --> 10:36.250
The key to fitting in
is to never stand out.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.750
Don't draw attention to yourself.

10:42.390 --> 10:45.290
Don't sit next to Harper
at lunch and you'll be fine.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.260
- Bye.
- Oh.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.830
Hey, Maxine, what are you doing for lunch?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.530
What took you so long?

10:57.570 --> 11:01.300
Usually when I ditch people,
their feelings get hurt

11:01.340 --> 11:02.870
and they don't try to find me, ok?

11:02.910 --> 11:05.010
That's the beauty of the ditch.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.380
But the more people I help,

11:06.410 --> 11:08.040
the closer I get to getting my wings.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.410
Come on, give me a chance.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.280
Please? Please? Please?

11:11.320 --> 11:13.920
You're not gonna give up, are you?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.690
I like you.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.350
I like you, too.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.420
Hmm. That's unnecessary.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.790
Ooh, here they come.

11:25.830 --> 11:28.560
Rip torn, rip Taylor, rip bag.

11:33.270 --> 11:34.300
Yeah!

11:38.210 --> 11:41.950
That's the meanest thing
I've ever seen Justin do.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.550
Where's the guardian angel they sent him?

11:44.580 --> 11:48.320
Oh, my gosh.
That's Rosie.

11:48.350 --> 11:50.950
Wait, wait.
How do you know her?

11:50.990 --> 11:53.090
She was my teacher when she was
a guardian angel. What do

11:53.120 --> 11:54.790
what do you mean "was?"

11:54.830 --> 11:57.460
Rosie's an angel of darkness now.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.800
What?!

11:58.830 --> 12:02.670
That's why Justin's acting bad.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.840
Rosie's changing him.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.650
You know
what I say to that? Yes!

12:17.680 --> 12:19.120
Justin.

12:20.590 --> 12:22.660
Go away, we're busy.

12:22.690 --> 12:24.360
You're not too busy for this.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.160
Rosie's an angel of darkness.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.690
She's been deceiving you.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.270
Hello, Tina.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.630
Hi, Rosie.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.540
You know her?

12:36.570 --> 12:39.370
Tina was one of my guardian angel students.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.010
I see you haven't gotten your wings yet.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.480
No, but I will.

12:44.510 --> 12:47.380
Even if I don't have a teacher anymore.

12:47.410 --> 12:50.980
Why don't you tell my brother
what you really are?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.050
What is she talking about?

12:53.080 --> 12:55.920
Justin, um...

12:55.950 --> 13:00.220
I wanted to wait and tell you
until the time was right.

13:00.260 --> 13:04.390
I'm not the kind of angel you think I am.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.660
But that doesn't mean that I
don't still care for you.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.570
I hope that you'll still care for me.

13:17.140 --> 13:20.740
I made my wings white around
you, so you wouldn't judge me.

13:22.810 --> 13:25.250
Well, he judges you now!

13:25.280 --> 13:28.520
Because you've done nothing
but make him act bad.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.920
So why don't you get to flappin'
those grungy lookin' wings,

13:30.950 --> 13:32.850
right back to...

13:32.890 --> 13:34.360
Where do angels of darkness live?

13:34.390 --> 13:37.730
- The dark realm.
- The dark realm.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.730
Fine. If that's what
Justin wants.

13:54.850 --> 13:57.080
I don't think that's
a good-bye hug.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.820
Justin, keep up.

14:03.850 --> 14:07.590
She's an angel
of dark-ness.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.890
Rosie, I don't care what
kind of angel you are.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.830
As long as we're together.

14:11.860 --> 14:14.030
That makes me feel so good.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.130
Or should I say bad.

14:16.170 --> 14:17.870
Justin, stop it!

14:17.900 --> 14:19.340
Can't you see what she's doing to you?

14:19.370 --> 14:21.670
She's influencing you.
You're not yourself.

14:21.710 --> 14:24.110
Rosie, why are you doing
this to these people?

14:24.140 --> 14:26.910
Why don't you just leave
them alone and come back

14:26.940 --> 14:28.410
and be my guardian angel teacher again?

14:28.450 --> 14:31.080
It's too late for that
now, Tina. Now go away.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.480
Come on, Justin.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.650
It's time for us to do
something really fun.

14:36.090 --> 14:38.290
Or should we say "bad."

14:38.320 --> 14:40.660
I just used that one, sweetie.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.430
But I stole it from you.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.600
Just like I stole this money.

14:44.630 --> 14:46.830
- Whoo!
- We are terrible!

14:46.870 --> 14:47.830
Let's go.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.010
I can't believe this.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.680
Where is Justin's guardian angel?

14:56.710 --> 14:58.110
He's supposed to be protecting him.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.480
I don't know.

15:00.510 --> 15:02.880
But I do know how to find out.

15:08.790 --> 15:10.760
You see, some day I'll get my wings

15:10.790 --> 15:12.160
and I'll really be able to fly

15:12.190 --> 15:14.060
instead of making that weird
flying noise with my mouth.

15:24.570 --> 15:27.870
Hey, everybody.
How was your day?

15:27.910 --> 15:30.510
Because mine stunk.

15:31.910 --> 15:35.410
Ew. Whatever mom's cooking
does too.

15:35.450 --> 15:38.050
Hey. I was gonna ask you
how many new friends you made

15:38.080 --> 15:41.350
over dinner, but now
you're not getting any.

15:41.390 --> 15:44.060
Max didn't make any friends.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.330
I told him to zero in on one friend,

15:46.360 --> 15:49.030
and then eventually move in
with her family.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.030
I heard that works.

15:53.930 --> 15:57.170
I don't want new friends.
I want my old friends.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.540
But when I tried to talk to them

15:58.570 --> 16:00.470
they told me they'd meet me
at the jungle gym.

16:00.510 --> 16:01.870
But they never showed up.

16:01.910 --> 16:04.180
I hung upside down for
an hour waiting for them.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.050
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

16:07.080 --> 16:10.420
I figured out a great way for
Max to meet tons of new friends.

16:10.450 --> 16:11.980
Are you ready?

16:12.020 --> 16:13.790
A slumber party!

16:18.030 --> 16:20.590
Harper, honey...

16:20.630 --> 16:24.130
We don't want to say that's a bad idea,

16:24.160 --> 16:25.900
- but it's just...
- No, Theresa.

16:25.930 --> 16:29.470
I think we do want to say
that's a bad idea.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.200
What is so bad about a slumber party?

16:32.240 --> 16:33.740
It's what every girl dreams of.

16:33.770 --> 16:35.240
And if they never experience one,

16:35.270 --> 16:36.670
they go through life never knowing the joys

16:36.710 --> 16:38.810
of friendships cemented
with all night giggling,

16:38.840 --> 16:41.410
secrets, popcorn, singing, texting,

16:41.450 --> 16:43.280
movies, games, pillow fights...

16:43.320 --> 16:44.350
Harper!

16:44.380 --> 16:47.150
You never had a slumber party, have you?

16:47.190 --> 16:50.150
How'd you know?

16:51.690 --> 16:54.990
Can we have a slumber party
for Max anyway? Please?

16:56.530 --> 16:58.660
I don't think so, Harper.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.100
Then we have a little problem.

17:24.890 --> 17:27.589
An old brick wall in a dirty alley.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.990
This is the kind of place
where bad things happen.

17:30.030 --> 17:31.560
I love it!

17:31.600 --> 17:33.300
What are we doing?

17:33.330 --> 17:35.300
There's an angel door here

17:35.330 --> 17:37.300
that leads to the guardian
angel dispatch center.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.540
That's where they keep the moral compass.

17:39.570 --> 17:41.570
An angel of darkness like me can't go in,

17:41.610 --> 17:43.610
so I want you to get it for me.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.210
The moral compass?
I've heard of it.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.950
- Good.
- Good.

17:47.980 --> 17:50.950
Yes, there's this very powerful
leader of the dark realm

17:50.980 --> 17:52.950
who wants that moral compass
more than anything.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.990
If you can use your magic,
then we can get it

17:55.020 --> 17:56.960
and take it to him.
And then he'll let us

17:56.990 --> 18:00.360
stay together in
the dark realm... forever.

18:00.390 --> 18:03.090
Together forever?

18:03.130 --> 18:04.430
Show me the door.

18:06.970 --> 18:09.230
Right this way.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.700
Whoa, that is bright.
They need a dimmer.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.980
Ok, adjust, adjust.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.480
I'm good.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.350
Lisa, you're up.

18:25.380 --> 18:29.220
See the girl about to spit
chocolate milk at her brother.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.560
Excuse me,
official-looking angel.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.020
Oh, hello.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.160
Did Tina bring you in here,

18:36.190 --> 18:38.690
because she's really
not supposed to do that.

18:38.730 --> 18:42.160
No.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.270
Is that the mighty instrument
used to influence good or bad

18:45.300 --> 18:47.040
throughout all worlds in the universe,

18:47.070 --> 18:49.400
also known as the moral compass?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.540
Yes. Why are you asking?

18:51.570 --> 18:54.040
Because I'm gonna steal it.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.950
Is it heavy, because I get back spasms.

18:57.980 --> 19:02.080
You know what's good for back spasms?

19:03.950 --> 19:06.090
If you stretch like this.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.160
Whoever felt it, melt it.

19:11.030 --> 19:13.830
He's working for the angels of darkness!

19:13.860 --> 19:15.600
Protect the compass!

19:15.630 --> 19:18.430
Without wands or cloaks,
you all turn to slow pokes.

19:20.470 --> 19:22.440
Sorry, angels.

19:22.470 --> 19:24.170
I think I'm gonna get it first.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.110
Stop!

19:33.150 --> 19:35.820
It's not there, angels, 'cause I've got it.

19:38.090 --> 19:40.420
Ok, so guess what this is.

19:40.460 --> 19:43.090
Oh, and don't say "halo," because
then the game will be too short.

19:43.130 --> 19:46.460
Bath towel ring.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.960
No, it's a halo!

19:48.000 --> 19:51.170
I borrowed it from a friend, and
guess what you can do with it?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.930
Oh, and don't say
"see angels."

19:52.970 --> 19:54.770
Uh, see angels?

19:54.810 --> 19:57.510
Sorry, I was tired of playing the game.

19:57.540 --> 20:00.980
Oh, me too.
The thing is,

20:01.010 --> 20:02.950
angels are invisible,
unless they want to be seen.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.950
So, this is how we're gonna
find Justin's guardian angel.

20:05.980 --> 20:07.790
Look.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.090
My gosh, they're everywhere.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.390
Yep. We're everywhere.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.690
Except bathrooms, because our wings
can't usually fit in the stalls.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.960
Oh, no.
There's Justin's angel.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.970
Monty. The cute one.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.000
Right.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.140
Thanks, Tina.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.950
What happened, monty?
Who did this to you?

20:34.980 --> 20:37.820
It was Rosie.
Your old teacher.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.390
As soon as I got here to
look after Justin russo,

20:41.420 --> 20:44.860
she came up behind me and,
well, you can see the rest.

20:44.890 --> 20:48.190
What does she want with Justin?

20:48.230 --> 20:49.890
Why is she steering him to the bad side?

20:49.930 --> 20:51.730
I don't know.
All I could get

20:51.760 --> 20:54.230
is this piece of paper I snatched
from her before she left,

20:54.270 --> 20:57.000
but it's confusing.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.770
"Rosie's angel of darkness to do list."

21:05.740 --> 21:08.910
One: Take Justin russo
to angel club.

21:08.950 --> 21:10.710
Two: Shampoo wings.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.650
"Three: Get Justin to steal
moral compass."

21:13.680 --> 21:15.520
And what part of this was confusing?

21:17.290 --> 21:19.690
You are no longer cute to me.

21:29.870 --> 21:32.600
Left hand, balloon.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.710
All right!
I can do it.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.510
I can do it. Yeah!

21:37.540 --> 21:40.510
Spin again! Whoo!

21:40.540 --> 21:42.680
Harper, when are we gonna get to play?

21:42.710 --> 21:44.210
When I fall down.

21:48.450 --> 21:51.220
Listen, break up your
stupid slumber party now,

21:51.260 --> 21:52.560
before I call the cops.

21:52.590 --> 21:55.760
Cops aren't going to
break up a slumber party.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.700
Oh, they will if rattlesnakes

21:57.730 --> 21:59.530
start crawling out of people's underwear.

21:59.570 --> 22:00.930
Wand!

22:00.970 --> 22:03.330
Don't you ruin my slumber party.

22:03.370 --> 22:04.570
I'll crush you.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.740
I want to go home.

22:05.770 --> 22:08.240
No! No, no, no.

22:08.270 --> 22:10.980
No one's going home.

22:11.010 --> 22:14.250
We're having fun.
You hear me? Fun!

22:14.280 --> 22:16.150
Ok.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.580
Everything's fine, 'cause it's time for...

22:18.620 --> 22:21.990
A dance party!
Whoo, yeah!

22:27.860 --> 22:30.360
Dance, everybody, dance!

22:52.320 --> 22:56.020
Master gorog.
We have succeeded.

22:56.060 --> 22:58.790
And where is the mighty wizard

22:58.830 --> 23:04.360
that we have chosen to fulfill the
dream we've carried for ages?

23:04.400 --> 23:07.670
Whoa, this is so cool!

23:07.700 --> 23:09.800
We... we were...

23:09.840 --> 23:12.740
We... were...
We were just down there,

23:12.770 --> 23:14.010
and now we're way up...

23:15.240 --> 23:16.540
Hi.

23:18.650 --> 23:20.180
Finally...

23:20.210 --> 23:22.650
...The moral compass.

23:30.060 --> 23:33.790
My brothers and sisters of darkness,

23:33.830 --> 23:38.500
we now have the power
to influence all mortals

23:38.530 --> 23:41.770
to make the darkest of choices!

23:44.410 --> 23:47.470
This fine, corrupt wizard

23:47.510 --> 23:52.210
has brought us the dawn of a dark new day!

24:11.660 --> 24:14.770
You're welcome.
All of you. Mm-hmm.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.700
Excuse me, your majesty,

24:17.740 --> 24:21.410
greatness, highness, badness.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.410
I did a very, very bad thing for you.

24:25.450 --> 24:27.780
Don't you think I deserve something,

24:27.810 --> 24:30.220
- like my own wings?
- Justin, be careful.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.280
No, I want wings.

24:33.290 --> 24:39.060
Vanity and greed set in.

24:39.090 --> 24:42.230
Wings? Sure.
Why not?

24:50.570 --> 24:53.410
How about an evil clap of thunder?

24:59.310 --> 25:02.150
- How about...
- Do not ask for more.

25:13.630 --> 25:16.900
Enjoy your wings, fallen wizard,

25:16.930 --> 25:21.370
as we cast our shadow on earth.

25:25.110 --> 25:28.540
Wow.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.180
Hey, think I can get one of
those glowy-hand thingys?

25:31.220 --> 25:33.320
I said no more.

25:41.230 --> 25:45.360
I'm sorry, but the sandwich
was a little dry.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.500
Oh, no, I'm sorry, sir, that
you didn't enjoy your sandwich.

25:50.700 --> 25:54.600
So, you think you can make
a better one, you jerk?!

25:54.640 --> 25:57.840
Yeah. Anybody can put
cardboard between bread!

25:59.180 --> 26:02.180
Hey, wait.
Let me lube it up for ya.

26:04.410 --> 26:05.980
Yeah!

26:07.650 --> 26:09.880
Oh, that's hilarious.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.050
That is not hilarious.
That's mean.

26:13.090 --> 26:15.990
Alex, stay focused.
We need to find your brother

26:16.030 --> 26:18.130
before Rosie gets him
to steal the moral compass.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.400
I don't care about my brother anymore.

26:20.430 --> 26:23.000
Hey, why don't we plop down
with a bag of something fried

26:23.030 --> 26:25.270
and watch people on the Internet
pretend they can sing.

26:27.070 --> 26:28.970
Oh, no!

26:29.000 --> 26:33.240
You're acting bad, and
your parents are acting bad.

26:33.270 --> 26:35.170
This can only mean one thing.

26:35.210 --> 26:37.980
Justin already got the moral
compass to the angels of darkness

26:38.010 --> 26:39.880
and they've changed it from good to bad.

26:39.910 --> 26:42.380
I'm not turning bad, you little twerp.

26:42.420 --> 26:45.120
Alex, listen to me.

26:45.150 --> 26:47.120
You're being influenced by dark forces.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.660
You have to fight it, so we
can save your brother Justin

26:49.690 --> 26:50.930
from the dark realm.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.190
You know what, I am tired of you

26:53.230 --> 26:55.460
yakking in my ear all day long,

26:55.500 --> 26:58.170
with your perky little voice, ok?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.640
There's no point in trying to help Justin,

27:00.670 --> 27:03.740
or anybody in this
dark world now, so just go.

27:03.770 --> 27:06.180
- Alex, no.
- Go.

27:06.210 --> 27:09.150
Just do that annoying flapping
thing with your mouth and go.

27:21.960 --> 27:24.790
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

27:24.830 --> 27:27.730
Come on, Maxine.
Everyone else did it.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.960
Pretend it's zac efron and kiss the pillow!

27:35.200 --> 27:37.640
No, wait.
I've got a better idea.

27:37.670 --> 27:40.470
- Punch zac efron!
- Yeah!

27:40.510 --> 27:43.180
Punch! Punch! Punch!
Punch! Punch! Punch!

27:44.080 --> 27:46.210
This slumber party is lame.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.620
I don't want to hang out
with these squealing girls.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.950
I want to hang out with guys my age.

27:50.990 --> 27:53.820
News flash: This slumber party
was really for me.

27:53.860 --> 27:57.260
So, why don't you go hang out in the
kitchen with the rest of the dips.

27:57.290 --> 28:00.260
Punch! Punch! Punch!
Punch! Punch! Punch!

28:00.300 --> 28:02.600
That's it.

28:02.630 --> 28:06.030
Stop these cries, turn
these girls into older guys.

28:13.910 --> 28:16.740
Hey, they're supposed to be ninth graders,

28:16.780 --> 28:18.680
not one-hundredth graders.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.490
You turned my slumber party
into an old fogey fest.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
Well, I'm not gonna let anything ruin it.

28:25.550 --> 28:29.490
Which one of you geezers
wants to braid my hair?

28:32.330 --> 28:34.700
All right.

28:40.670 --> 28:45.170
So, my bad brother,
what's on the agenda? Hmm?

28:45.210 --> 28:48.380
Steal? Lie?

28:48.410 --> 28:50.480
Spit off the roof?

28:52.950 --> 28:55.180
A little dry.
Why don't you go first.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.590
Your wizard is...
Interesting.

29:01.620 --> 29:04.030
Yes, very interesting.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.990
And cute.

29:06.030 --> 29:09.730
I meant interesting
as in "strange."

29:11.230 --> 29:13.800
Nonetheless, you've done well.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.470
You shall be rewarded.

29:15.510 --> 29:20.180
You can be the one who decides
how he will be destroyed.

29:20.210 --> 29:22.980
Destroyed?
What do you mean?

29:23.010 --> 29:24.510
That was never part of the plan.

29:24.550 --> 29:27.680
Of course it was.
He's an outsider.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.750
But he brought you
the compass as you asked.

29:29.790 --> 29:31.220
Just let him go.

29:31.260 --> 29:34.420
Let him go?

29:34.460 --> 29:36.790
Is that sympathy?

29:38.400 --> 29:41.400
You're not becoming weak, are you?

29:41.430 --> 29:44.600
Like the guardian angel you once were?

29:44.640 --> 29:46.100
No.

29:46.140 --> 29:50.710
You are an angel of darkness.

29:50.740 --> 29:52.680
Do not betray me!

30:02.160 --> 30:03.720
My, Rosie.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.760
I haven't even thanked you for showing me

30:05.790 --> 30:08.530
the evil of my good ways.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.860
Does that make sense?
I think it does.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.730
Justin, we have to get out of here now.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.030
- Please.
- Why?

30:14.070 --> 30:16.440
Because...

30:16.470 --> 30:17.770
I care about you.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.370
But we can just stay here
forever, just like you said.

30:20.410 --> 30:21.910
Justin, we have to leave now

30:21.940 --> 30:25.150
because gorog is going to destroy you.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.820
Gorog won't destroy me.
He needs me.

30:27.850 --> 30:29.980
No, he's used you and now he's done.

30:30.020 --> 30:31.990
- Please, let's go.
- No.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.790
I'm never going back.

30:37.090 --> 30:39.360
I'm no longer a wizard.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.660
I'm an angel of darkness.

30:46.170 --> 30:48.370
Thanks to you, I now know where I belong.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.340
What have I done?

31:03.620 --> 31:05.420
Shh, shh!

31:05.450 --> 31:07.590
Alex, I need your help.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.760
Whatever it is, I don't have time.

31:09.790 --> 31:12.160
I have a slumber party to go to.

31:12.190 --> 31:15.300
This bag of angry badgers
and six obnoxious little girls

31:15.330 --> 31:17.300
are about to have a screaming contest.

31:17.330 --> 31:20.200
Alex, your brother is being held by gorog.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.170
Shh!

31:22.210 --> 31:23.540
Gorog?

31:23.570 --> 31:26.380
That sounds like a boost
you put in your smoothie.

31:26.410 --> 31:28.340
"Excuse me, I'll have the strawberry dazzle

31:28.380 --> 31:30.210
with a vitamin c
and a shot of gorog."

31:30.250 --> 31:32.410
- I'm funny.
- No.

31:32.450 --> 31:35.920
Alex, gorog is the leader
of all the angels of darkness.

31:35.950 --> 31:37.490
He's going to destroy your brother.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.050
Then why did you bring Justin to him?

31:40.090 --> 31:43.660
I didn't know this was gonna happen.
I was tricked, too, Alex.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.660
Oh, you'll have to do
so much better than that

31:48.700 --> 31:50.500
if you want to outlie a liar.

31:50.530 --> 31:53.100
No, Alex, I'm telling
the truth. I promise. Please.

31:53.140 --> 31:56.040
This was all gorog's plan,
and I followed it,

31:56.070 --> 32:00.010
but I never expected to
fall in love with Justin.

32:01.910 --> 32:04.650
Hold on. Are you...
Are you crying?

32:04.680 --> 32:07.520
I thought you were an angel of darkness.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.180
You're starting to sound good.

32:09.220 --> 32:13.220
Well, I guess that's what
falling in love does to you.

32:13.260 --> 32:16.090
Alex, please.
There isn't much time, ok?

32:16.130 --> 32:17.760
Do the right thing for your brother.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.760
I know there's still some good left in you.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.730
No, there isn't. Wait.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.670
There it is.
A little piece of good.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.500
Darn it!
Here, hold this.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.470
Oh, no. Alex!

32:42.280 --> 32:44.720
Hey! Guardian angels!
Come on!

32:44.750 --> 32:48.320
I need your help. You have
to help me save my brother!

32:48.360 --> 32:51.890
Come on! Break time's over.
What's going on?

32:51.930 --> 32:53.060
Calling all angels.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.460
We've got some dark realm butt to kick.

32:55.500 --> 32:59.070
Ok, who else really likes hearing the
word "butt" over the loudspeaker?

32:59.100 --> 33:01.970
Uh, butt!

33:04.440 --> 33:06.080
Ok, no, come on, come on!

33:06.110 --> 33:07.380
You're too late.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.510
The moral compass has been set to bad,

33:09.550 --> 33:12.010
so guardian angels are powerless.

33:12.050 --> 33:15.450
I can't even scratch my own
wings. Can you get it, dear?

33:15.480 --> 33:18.220
Where's Tina?

33:18.250 --> 33:21.460
She went to the dark realm
to get the moral compass

33:21.490 --> 33:23.290
and help your brother.

33:23.330 --> 33:24.990
She went by herself?

33:25.030 --> 33:28.130
She's not gonna stand a chance.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.430
Then, I guess it's on me.

33:30.470 --> 33:31.970
Tina's got some
back-up coming.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.670
Oh, wait, wait!

33:33.700 --> 33:36.640
Wizard powers are weak in the dark realm.

33:36.670 --> 33:38.740
If you have any chance
of saving your brother,

33:38.780 --> 33:40.280
you'll need wings.

33:40.310 --> 33:44.050
We keep an extra pair
in case of an emergency.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.620
Oh, my gosh! Awesome!

33:50.320 --> 33:51.360
What do these do?

33:51.390 --> 33:54.260
Do they shoot like, lasers and stuff?

33:54.290 --> 33:56.490
No, they're just wings.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.030
You'll need them to get to the dark realm.

33:59.060 --> 34:01.700
Oh. Ok.

34:01.730 --> 34:03.700
You know what's good for
emergencies? Lasers.

34:03.730 --> 34:05.470
You know what's not?
Feathers.

34:07.370 --> 34:09.670
Well, I'll still look cute anyway.

34:21.420 --> 34:24.219
So, gorog.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.989
Now that I've broken my wand,

34:26.020 --> 34:28.060
that's proof that I'm
totally committed to you.

34:28.090 --> 34:30.460
Is there an angel of darkness handbook?

34:30.489 --> 34:32.659
Because I'm not quite sure
if my shirt should be tucked,

34:32.690 --> 34:35.300
or untucked. I mean,
untucked does seem badder,

34:35.330 --> 34:37.100
but I can see that you're tucked.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.199
What's going on?

34:41.239 --> 34:43.040
Oh, you'll soon see.

34:43.070 --> 34:47.040
You brought me the moral
compass, so I'm done with you.

34:48.510 --> 34:51.179
No, no, no, gorog!
Wait, please! Listen to me!

34:54.250 --> 34:57.620
No need to be afraid of
heights, if you're an angel.

34:57.650 --> 35:00.520
Of course, if you're
an angel with no wings,

35:00.560 --> 35:02.890
then you have a problem.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.260
No, no, no!
Not my wings!

35:08.450 --> 35:10.750
How can you do this?
I brought you everything you wanted.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.700
Stop!

35:13.390 --> 35:16.130
Leave Justin alone and give us
back the moral compass.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.200
It's ours.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.470
Ok. You can laugh now,

35:23.500 --> 35:25.870
because I'm about to make all y'all cry.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.730
Gorog, let me dispose of this
pest and prove my loyalty to you.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.460
And if you let me live, I swear I'll
always guard the moral compass.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.400
Hmm.

35:52.430 --> 35:56.270
Yes. I can see the
possible value in that.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.370
An angel of darkness committed to keeping

35:59.410 --> 36:02.410
the moral compass in the dark realm.

36:02.440 --> 36:03.810
Proceed.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.650
Wait! No, Justin,
I'm here to save you.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.380
Maybe you should be saving yourself.

36:08.410 --> 36:09.810
Let her go!
Brakes.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.120
Where are the brakes on these things?!

36:11.150 --> 36:15.820
To your right!

36:15.860 --> 36:19.160
I know it doesn't look like it,
but I'm here to help you.

36:19.190 --> 36:21.460
No.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.500
Let him prove himself.

36:25.610 --> 36:28.470
Justin, you're not an angel of darkness.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.740
You're a wizard, a good wizard.

36:30.770 --> 36:32.740
You know in your heart
you don't belong here.

36:32.770 --> 36:35.340
And neither does that moral compass.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.740
I'm not leaving.

36:37.780 --> 36:43.480
Justin, please.

36:46.050 --> 36:48.350
Well, then I'm gonna
take this back with me.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.830
No! Give it!

36:59.870 --> 37:02.000
Turn the arrow around!
Turn the arrow!

37:04.370 --> 37:05.340
Yes!

37:16.920 --> 37:20.520
Ok, grandpa.
It's your turn to kiss zac efron.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.400
Jerry, what's going on in here?!

37:30.430 --> 37:33.230
Hey, everybody, stop!
Right now!

37:34.870 --> 37:36.430
Give us those pillows!

37:46.950 --> 37:50.080
- Justin, you're breaking it!
- No, I'm not. You are.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.780
- No, look, you're cracking it.
- What?

37:53.050 --> 37:54.890
Stop her!

37:54.920 --> 37:57.190
Don't you mess with the wizard!

38:02.430 --> 38:03.890
Give that back to me.

38:14.300 --> 38:17.140
What? My wand!

38:17.810 --> 38:19.340
Rosie?!

38:19.380 --> 38:20.410
No more!

38:20.440 --> 38:22.350
I'm sorry I did this for you!

38:22.380 --> 38:25.550
Angels of darkness never feel sorry.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.780
She does now!

38:36.530 --> 38:39.400
Oh, dear. What a mess.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.970
Oh, mom.
I'm really sorry.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.600
I promise I'll pay for a new
pillow with my allowance.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.870
What happened to the little
girls from the slumber party?

38:51.910 --> 38:57.010
I got mad and turned them
into old guys. Sorry.

38:57.050 --> 38:59.720
That's all right. I'm sure
it was an accident.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.720
Just turn them back into little girls

39:01.750 --> 39:03.820
and I'm sure everything will be all right.

39:06.790 --> 39:10.260
Or, we could turn them into something else.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.900
Like fruit.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.400
Perfect.

39:14.430 --> 39:17.030
I'll make them into one of
my signature fruit hats.

39:17.070 --> 39:19.900
The fruit flies ate my last one.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.740
Turn them into talking fruit.

39:21.770 --> 39:24.770
I want to hear them beg me not to eat 'em.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.450
Fruity pa-tootie.

39:38.420 --> 39:41.190
I want to go home!

39:41.230 --> 39:42.990
This party stinks.

39:55.110 --> 39:56.640
Let it go!

39:56.670 --> 40:00.180
Hold on, Alex! I'll take
Justin down with the halo.

40:04.150 --> 40:05.150
He threw it.

40:07.050 --> 40:08.820
Give it to me! Stop it!

40:08.860 --> 40:11.020
I'm serious, give me the compass, Alex!

40:11.060 --> 40:13.060
Give it here!

40:13.090 --> 40:14.490
Justin!

40:14.530 --> 40:16.600
No!

40:26.610 --> 40:27.670
I've got it.

40:27.710 --> 40:30.140
No, I've got it.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.910
Now, give me that moral compass

40:32.950 --> 40:36.080
or you'll never see her again.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.950
Not if I turn it to good.

40:45.130 --> 40:47.430
My allegiance lies with gorog.

40:49.730 --> 40:51.900
The dark realm prevails!

40:51.930 --> 40:53.700
Justin, don't!

40:53.740 --> 40:57.840
Justin, I'm so, so sorry for
everything that's happened.

40:57.870 --> 40:59.440
I pretended to fall in love with you

40:59.470 --> 41:02.180
to carry out gorog's plan,
but along the way,

41:02.210 --> 41:05.250
you touched my heart
and you made that love real.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.210
You love me?

41:08.280 --> 41:12.150
Justin, give it to me.

41:15.260 --> 41:16.960
Take this to the guardian
angels. I'll be fine.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.490
Ok.

41:22.300 --> 41:24.770
No!

41:49.220 --> 41:50.990
Rosie...

41:52.230 --> 41:54.590
You have betrayed me,

41:54.630 --> 41:57.400
and forsaken the dark realm.

41:57.430 --> 41:59.500
Get out!

42:02.900 --> 42:05.940
I'm gonna go to, if that's ok with you.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.020
I'm sorry. It's hard
to have a soft landing

42:18.050 --> 42:19.290
with a broken wand.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.720
Look, Justin.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.530
I totally deceived you

42:25.560 --> 42:28.160
and I don't even deserve
to be here with you right now,

42:28.200 --> 42:29.930
but if you can forgive me,

42:29.970 --> 42:32.200
I'd love for us to start all over.

42:32.230 --> 42:34.030
Of course I forgive you.

42:34.070 --> 42:36.000
Oh, I'm so glad.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.540
But we can't be together.

42:42.580 --> 42:44.380
What? Why?

42:46.550 --> 42:48.650
Rosie, everything we've been through

42:48.680 --> 42:51.450
has made me realize something.

42:51.490 --> 42:53.990
The world is a fragile place.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.790
It's always teetering between good and bad.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.660
Look how easy it was for me
to forget what's right.

43:01.400 --> 43:04.470
Of course I want to be with you.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.000
But the world needs another
guardian angel more.

43:09.010 --> 43:12.740
You are such a good person.

43:12.780 --> 43:17.050
But Justin, I don't think I have what
it takes to be a guardian angel again.

43:17.080 --> 43:20.350
Hey, you saved me.

43:20.380 --> 43:23.790
When the whole world turned bad,
you stayed good.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.290
Because of you.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.360
Rosie, I will miss you.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.270
I'll miss you, too.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.740
Hey, do me a favor.
Every once in awhile,

43:41.780 --> 43:44.740
do something a little bit bad
so I have reason to come visit.

43:46.350 --> 43:48.250
Ok.

43:58.630 --> 44:00.130
Oops.

44:19.450 --> 44:23.110
Sorry. It felt like
the right time to sing that.

44:23.150 --> 44:25.580
Alex and Tina,

44:25.620 --> 44:28.820
you went where no guardian
angel dared to go,

44:28.860 --> 44:31.890
and returned the compass
to its rightful place,

44:31.930 --> 44:35.660
saving the world from an
indefinite age of darkness.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.830
For this incredible bravery, Alex,

44:37.860 --> 44:39.230
you can keep the wings we gave you.

44:39.270 --> 44:42.030
Oh. Um, good,

44:42.070 --> 44:44.340
because I don't think you're
gonna want these back.

44:46.740 --> 44:50.270
Now, Tina, for your part,

44:50.310 --> 44:54.780
I hereby promote you to
official guardian angel.

44:56.720 --> 45:01.150
And there's someone here who
wants to congratulate you.

45:03.220 --> 45:05.220
Rosie, you're back!

45:10.860 --> 45:11.800
My wings!

45:11.830 --> 45:14.270
Congratulations, Tina!

45:14.300 --> 45:18.600
They smell brand new!

45:18.640 --> 45:22.780
Can my first assignment be
to watch over Alex russo?

45:22.810 --> 45:25.580
No, no. I will be good.

45:25.610 --> 45:27.250
I promise, ok?

45:27.280 --> 45:29.550
This is the first time I've
ever said that and meant it.

45:29.580 --> 45:31.990
Don't follow.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.360
Excuse me.

45:37.690 --> 45:39.690
Guardian angel dispatch.

45:39.730 --> 45:43.400
She's done something bad already?!

45:43.430 --> 45:46.130
All right, Tina.
You're up.

45:46.170 --> 45:47.970
Yes!

45:48.000 --> 45:50.200
Excuse me! Pardon me,
excuse me!

46:06.590 --> 46:07.960
Justin.

46:09.260 --> 46:12.230
What are you doing
still up? It's late.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.960
I stayed up because I owe you something.

46:16.630 --> 46:19.100
I found it in Washington square park.

46:19.130 --> 46:21.400
A two-headed dog had it.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.100
I'm pretty sure he didn't
start out that way.

46:26.210 --> 46:28.410
Thank you.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.110
What about your wand?

46:30.140 --> 46:32.810
I, uh...

46:35.280 --> 46:38.250
I'll find a spell to fix it.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.760
And I owe you something else.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.230
Thank you for saving me.

46:49.270 --> 46:53.170
It's for all the times that you saved me

46:53.200 --> 46:55.410
when I wasn't so good.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.740
And for a couple more times
in the future, so we're even.

46:57.770 --> 47:01.040
No, we're not.

47:01.080 --> 47:03.010
You saved the world today.

47:05.010 --> 47:06.750
You gave up a girl to protect it.

47:09.150 --> 47:12.590
Why do we have to keep
dealing with stuff like this?

47:12.620 --> 47:15.260
We're wizards.

47:15.290 --> 47:19.130
I don't think we have a choice.

47:29.340 --> 47:31.570
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

47:31.610 --> 47:33.710
Apple. Knock knock.

47:33.740 --> 47:37.250
- Who's there?
- Apple. Knock knock.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.450
- Who's there?
- Lemon.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.020
Lemon who?

47:41.050 --> 47:43.890
Lemon-know if you want me
to say apple again.

47:46.890 --> 47:48.680
See, Alex, I told you.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.940
All they do is tell bad food jokes

47:51.270 --> 47:52.400
I am getting the blender.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.510
Oh wait wait wait wait wait. I got another one.

47:54.820 --> 47:56.510
Oh that would be funny.

47:57.230 --> 47:58.510
Knock knock.
