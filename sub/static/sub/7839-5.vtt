I'm joining a professional
arm wrestling circuit.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.641
Uh-huh, and how will this affect
your job at the power plant?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.210
Negatively, I assume.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.851
Oh, well, we're off
to buy a new tea set.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.287
Have fun.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.485
Jeez, she didn't seem
angry or anything.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.688
Maybe she doesn't care
anymore.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.888
Forget about her, Homer.
She's dead to you now.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.450
Okay.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.726
Now, if we get bored
on the bus,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.882
I got a book of
brainteasers here.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.961
Let's see.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.726
Oh! "Brothers and sisters
have I none,

11:53.800 --> 11:57.407
"but this man's
father is my father's son."

11:57.480 --> 11:58.481
Huh.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.084
Ah, screw you,
you stupid thing!

12:03.640 --> 12:06.450
"He is my son."
That blows.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.050
I can't wait to use

12:11.120 --> 12:12.963
our new Krusty the
Clown tea service.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.246
Me neither.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.608

I'll be right back.

What are you gonna do with that teapot?
Gay out?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.442
I'll answer for you. Yes.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.521
What? Um...

12:42.800 --> 12:43.801
Uh...

12:43.880 --> 12:45.723
I just shoplifted
this bad boy.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.484
Housewares never
knew what hit 'em.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.324
Why didn't you steal
something cool?

12:49.520 --> 12:54.162
Uh, because I'm gonna bring it back
to the store for store credit.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.289
How are you gonna get credit
without a gift receipt, ass?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.771
Um, well...

12:58.880 --> 13:00.962
We've seen you hanging out
with your mom, Simpson.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.805
Word on the street
is you're a mama's boy.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.641
Hey! There is no way that
Bart Simpson is a mama's boy.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.850
Oh, Bart!
Aren't they jazzy?

13:12.920 --> 13:15.526
They match the new curtains
we hung in your tree house.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.967
Here, try yours on.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.644
I got you a child's

13:19.720 --> 13:21.404
your tummy's getting
kind of bloopy

13:21.480 --> 13:23.164
from all the cakes
we've been having.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.204
Somebody here
likes princess cakes.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.645
Princess cake?

13:27.720 --> 13:30.883
Bart, you just got yourself
a nickname for life.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.123
Hey, Princess Cake,

Shut up! I don't want
your stupid sweatshirt!

13:46.440 --> 13:50.764
Mom, I only hung out with you
because I felt sorry for you.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.325
That was weird.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.640
Will you teach us
how to smoke?

13:55.720 --> 13:56.721
No!

(BART GRUNTING)

14:04.080 --> 14:06.765

me into being a mama's boy.

Bart?

14:18.720 --> 14:19.801
You're not allowed in here!

14:19.920 --> 14:21.888
Can't you read the sign?
You mean this?

BART: <i>Ay, caramba!</i>
(GRUNTS)

14:26.960 --> 14:28.121
I'm worried about Mom.

Hey, Mom.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.325
Hello, Bart. Just so you
know, I sold our bike.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.607
Faster! Faster!

15:21.000 --> 15:23.685
Mom, I really did like
hanging out with you.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.001
(SIGHS) Hmm.

15:29.320 --> 15:33.211
You know, there's a karaoke
night at school tomorrow.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.444
Some of the little kids are bringing
their parents. Do you want to go?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.921
Really? Can we do a duet?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.611
Sure, why not?
(CHUCKLES)

15:42.680 --> 15:43.966
It'll be fun.

(MEN GRUNTING)

15:52.080 --> 15:55.926
Oh, I can't believe Marge hasn't called me.
Maybe I should go home.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.126
Oh, Marge called you.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.089
She said, uh,
that she loves you

15:59.160 --> 16:00.844
and she hopes you
break the guy's arm

16:00.920 --> 16:02.684
so hard that it pokes through his skin.
(CHUCKLES)

16:02.760 --> 16:04.046
Did she say anything else?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.531
Yeah. She said
to shut up and stop

16:05.600 --> 16:07.125
asking questions
and listen to Moe.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.847
Oh, Marge.
I love her so much.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.127
Now, Homer, you got to keep your
head in the game, all right?

16:12.240 --> 16:15.323
Your first opponent is Leftie
"The Righty" Leftwright.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.561
(GRUNTS)

16:18.840 --> 16:20.365
Whoa. He looks tough.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.523
Yeah. He only lost once, in
his fight against illiteracy.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.127
I can relate. I fought that
foe and lost many times.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.561
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, Marge isn't home.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.041
Homer, focus.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.202
Moe, I'm starting
to have grave doubts

16:38.280 --> 16:40.806
about this thing I barely
liked in the first place.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.847
Come on, Homer.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.843
We can make it all the way
to the quarter-finals

16:43.920 --> 16:47.766

B over 35 amateur grouping!

taken by me and my mother.

stage, it's more like "scary-oke."

Uh, scary talented,
I assume.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.082
I'm singing a song

have been performing together

17:21.720 --> 17:24.929
since l was in fourth grade, and
it's really brought us closer.

Good boy. You can push your
crib into Mommy's room tonight.
