WEBVTT

00:05.138 --> 00:06.306
Hey, Richard.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.774
Never mind.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.309
What do you mean, never mind?
I called your name.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.476
With a tone.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.645
All right, come on.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.780
I'll give you voluntary.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.649
Make it involuntary,
you have a deal.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.417
Can't.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.384
Richard.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.553
I've got marching orders.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.287
Remember, this thing
was on tape.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.756
We've got a public outcry
to deal with.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.625
Public outcry?
The public is with her.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.627
Ellenor, I'm giving you
manslaughter

00:26.660 --> 00:29.495
for a premeditated
murder.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.232
Why can't you ever
take a gift and smile?

00:40.507 --> 00:42.475
It is a good deal,
Sally.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.477
The only possible defense
we have

00:44.511 --> 00:46.412
is temporary insanity.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.115
And because you don't want
to say that you were insane --

00:49.149 --> 00:51.518
I wasn't!

00:51.552 --> 00:54.220
Well, then I think
that we should jump

00:54.254 --> 00:56.389
at manslaughter.

00:56.422 --> 00:58.324
How much time
would I have to serve?

00:58.358 --> 01:00.527
You would probably be
sentenced to eight years,

01:00.561 --> 01:03.196
and with any luck,
you would only have to

01:03.229 --> 01:04.864
serve three or four.

01:04.897 --> 01:09.469
Sally, you shot
an unarmed man.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.404
If somebody raped
and murdered my daughter,

01:11.437 --> 01:13.674
I might have done
the same thing.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.610
But the problem is
you planned it.

01:16.643 --> 01:21.347
If we go for a not guilty
on the elements,

01:21.381 --> 01:24.350
you could be going
to prison for life.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.386
Take the manslaughter.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.624
No.

01:30.657 --> 01:31.892
Sally...

01:31.925 --> 01:33.594
No.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.267
Okay. so the trial
will start tomorrow.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.140
(knock on door)

01:47.173 --> 01:49.576
Guard?

01:49.610 --> 01:52.212
Okay. we're going to see you
at the courthouse.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.123
â™ª

02:49.870 --> 02:50.837
BOBBY: How could she
not take it?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.472
She doesn't want to serve
three years for --

02:52.506 --> 02:53.940
she'll be serving life
if she doesn't accept.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.809
Bobby, I told her that.
so did Jimmy.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.277
She wants to try
to beat it.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.311
Did you tell her
the odds?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.479
Yes, we did.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.881
So, what? Are you
arguing insanity?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.949
Well unfortunately, she doesn't
want to do that, either.

03:02.983 --> 03:03.950
Who's in charge here?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.218
She is.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.820
She's the client,
remember?

03:06.853 --> 03:07.821
And you're her lawyer,
which means you need --

03:07.854 --> 03:09.489
Bobby, don't lecture me.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.357
Judge Hiller is sitting.
she won't let you

03:11.391 --> 03:12.959
argue nullification.
you know she won't.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.563
Have we got a psychiatrist
to say she was insane?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.965
I got Dr. Tippett
on standby.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.567
I am telling you,
she will not let us do it.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.969
Ellenor, this thing
is all over the news,

03:23.003 --> 03:25.371
which means if Sally Berg
goes down on murder one,

03:25.405 --> 03:27.240
we'll be played
for the idiots, not her.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.909
Oh, so this is
about our ego?

03:28.942 --> 03:32.378
Partly, yes, but it goes
with her best interests.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.581
You go back to her. make her see
if she doesn't plead insanity --

03:34.615 --> 03:35.582
We tried.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.518
Try again.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.521
If she refuses, file the motion
to withdraw as counsel.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.323
Bobby, this is just like
our rabbi case.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.926
Maybe we could argue
moral duress again.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.995
No, Jimmy, because this time,
we have judge Hiller.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.230
Go back to the client.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.634
She either takes manslaughter,
pleads insanity, or we withdraw.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.245
Hey, Sally.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.484
All right, listen,

04:11.518 --> 04:14.354
as much as you're opposed
to it on principle,

04:14.387 --> 04:16.356
we all agree that if we're
going to go to trial,

04:16.389 --> 04:18.625
we have to go
with temporary insanity.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.562
The only other choice
we have

04:21.595 --> 04:23.697
is jury nullification,

04:23.730 --> 04:26.700
and that judge will
shut us down in a second.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.703
But if we win
on temporary,

04:29.736 --> 04:31.705
you could avoid prison
altogether.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.439
You have a chance,

04:33.473 --> 04:35.441
but you have to
let us do our job.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.877
If we're to give you
the best representa--

04:38.344 --> 04:39.445
What did she say?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.582
She just called me
a bitch.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.450
Look, I don't need you,
and I don't need this case.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.019
You could get life.
I don't really care.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.042
He killed my baby!

05:34.935 --> 05:36.903
Let me do my job.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.807
Let me do my job.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.968
What?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.970
What's going on?

06:10.003 --> 06:12.005
We're pleading
temporary insanity.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.685
Richard.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.688
Helen. to what
do I owe this?

06:27.721 --> 06:30.891
Uh, well, actually...

06:30.924 --> 06:33.560
I was just
assigned second chair.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.961
Excuse me?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.463
It's getting a lot
of heat, so...

06:37.497 --> 06:38.965
They put you on
to what, backstop me?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.502
I asked
to be put on it.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.169
Why?

06:43.203 --> 06:46.039
Well...

06:46.072 --> 06:49.576
Helen, what's going on?

06:49.610 --> 06:52.646
What's going on is

06:52.679 --> 06:54.447
you're a little
under review.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.916
What do you mean,
I'm under review?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.183
You've dropped
some big trials,

06:57.217 --> 07:00.053
and in addition
to losing these cases,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.055
you've also
lost your poise,

07:02.088 --> 07:04.991
especially against
Ellenor Frutt.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.993
Richard,
it's an election year.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.995
There could be
some changes.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.665
You don't want this one
getting away from you,

07:11.698 --> 07:15.068
trust me.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.004
So you -- you asked
to be put on

07:18.038 --> 07:20.674
because I could
lose my job?

07:20.707 --> 07:24.044
It hasn't come to that,
but we don't want it to.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.949
There isn't a D.A.
in this department

07:28.982 --> 07:31.618
who goes in more prepared
than I do --

07:31.652 --> 07:32.953
every single trial.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.821
I know that,

07:34.855 --> 07:37.691
but you've had some
pretty high-profile defeats,

07:37.724 --> 07:40.927
and you've been somewhat
of a loose cannon.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.832
Richard...

07:45.866 --> 07:48.902
Let's just win this.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.845
390 people?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.847
It's not my fault.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.849
You invited 390 people
to our wedding?

08:02.883 --> 08:03.950
I didn't invite them.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.152
The idiot at the stationery
shop made the mistake.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.020
There were two lists.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.189
One was just the notice
of our marriage

08:09.222 --> 08:11.792
after the wedding. she sent
invitations to both lists.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.659
What's going on?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.861
390 people got invited
to our wedding.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.530
So what do we do now?

08:16.563 --> 08:18.665
Uninvite them?
send out a notice,

08:18.699 --> 08:19.800
"hey, we never meant
to include you."

08:19.833 --> 08:20.967
It wasn't my fault.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.703
Lindsay, you were
in charge of this.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.270
Only because
you couldn't be bothered.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.072
I couldn't even get you
to look at the invitations.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.273
Oh, this is my fault.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.075
Well it isn't mine.
you want to get married,

08:29.109 --> 08:31.077
but I have to do
all of the planning.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.879
Hey, if it were up to me,
we'd elope.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.280
You know what?
You plan it.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.751
390 people? I don't even
know 390 people!

08:37.784 --> 08:40.020
I think you both
are acting out.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.722
Stay out of it.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.131
Okay, I will
stay out of it.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.099
We had just taken
Mr. Whittier into custody.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.234
Where was that?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.902
At his own house.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.038
And as we were
leaving the dwelling,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.707
I observed Ms. Berg approaching
from across the street.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.043
What happened next,
officer?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.778
My partner and I
both instructed her

09:04.811 --> 09:06.179
not to approach,
but she kept coming.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.181
Then suddenly
she's raising a gun,

09:08.214 --> 09:10.050
saying something
about her daughter.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.118
This woman right here.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.587
Yes.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.255
We then reached
for our own weapons,

09:15.288 --> 09:16.857
but it was too late.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.592
Your honor, at this time

09:18.625 --> 09:20.026
we'd like to play
the videotape.

09:21.562 --> 09:25.331
Members of the jury you're about
to see footage captured by a
local news team.

09:25.365 --> 09:29.235
The parties have stipulated to
it's admissibility.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.571
Go ahead Mr. Bay.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.608
This arrest, of course,
has been anticipated

09:34.641 --> 09:36.342
since early
this morning, when --

09:36.376 --> 09:39.279
um, this is Michael Whittier.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.148
He is in custody. you see him
there in the middle,

09:42.182 --> 09:45.151
and he is apparently
offering no resistance.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.053
Michael Whittier --

09:47.087 --> 09:48.789
Okay, at this time,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.023
I'd like to direct
your attention

09:50.056 --> 09:52.158
to the right side
of the screen.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.094
This happens
pretty quickly.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.764
Once again, a suspect
in the rape and murder

09:57.798 --> 09:59.766
of 7-year-old Jessica Berg.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.903
Rumors of his arrest
have been imminent.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.370
(gasps) He's been shot!

10:04.404 --> 10:06.773
Michael Whittier
has just been shot!

10:06.807 --> 10:09.776
Someone has fired -- I know
I heard at least two shots,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.111
but he is down.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.914
Michael Whittier
has just been shot.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.851
The police have the shooter,
but I can't see --

10:17.884 --> 10:21.788
he has been shot.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.389
Officer Finley,

10:23.423 --> 10:25.391
do you see
in the courtroom

10:25.425 --> 10:28.962
the person
who fired those shots?

10:28.995 --> 10:30.330
It was the defendant.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.778
Bobby, I don't mean
to be nosy, but --

10:44.811 --> 10:47.447
You don't mean
to be nosy? Since when?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.415
Look, obviously,
you two are fighting.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.416
We're not fighting.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.518
Well, she's fighting,

10:51.552 --> 10:54.254
but you're just not involved
enough to realize it.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.156
Lucy, I think you should
just stay out of things.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.424
Is that possible?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.693
Foley Depo.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.294
Thank you.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.029
We go in for our marriage
license today.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.230
You did manage
to remember that?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.298
Yes.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.167
Good.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.334
What is your problem?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.469
Problem? I don't
have a problem.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.437
Look, Lindsay, you screwed up
the invitations, not me --

11:11.471 --> 11:13.073
Maybe if I had
a little help.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.474
-Here we go.
-Don't "here we go" me.

11:14.508 --> 11:18.211
I have had to do everything.
You know I had to make
the lists--

11:18.244 --> 11:19.780
First you complain that
I was booking everything --

11:19.813 --> 11:22.015
I meant the church
and your dead mother's dress,

11:22.048 --> 11:24.885
but when it comes to the work,
you just can't be bothered.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.286
Well, I'm bothered now.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.355
I don't think you even
want to be married.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.891
Here we go.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.158
Don't "here we go" me.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.094
If you "here we go" me
one more time,

11:34.127 --> 11:35.829
I am going to scream,
okay? Do you hear me?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.964
Oh, and I hate
that one, too.
Listen to yourself.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.833
"here we go"
and "listen to yourself."

11:39.866 --> 11:40.901
If you ever say
those things

11:40.934 --> 11:41.968
in our marriage,
I will scream, okay?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.770
It's good
to know these things

11:43.804 --> 11:45.371
before we become
husband and wife.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.974
You know, this is --
this is very, very healthy.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.009
Bug off.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.813
Well...

11:54.147 --> 11:57.884
It's nice to know
you can make her scream.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.757
As you can see,
we were back far enough.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.226
There she is
getting out of her car.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.094
She's got something
in her coat.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.796
She's moving
across the street.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.897
The police are
all on the street,

12:10.931 --> 12:13.099
so there's no one
stopping her.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.100
Okay, here it comes.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.036
She pulls out the weapon.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.170
Bang, bang.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.105
She drops the weapon
and puts her hands up.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.976
Then she's tackled
by the officers.

12:23.009 --> 12:26.412
That's pretty much it.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.320
What do you mean,
you can't testify?

12:34.354 --> 12:37.323
Look, I didn't think
she was insane to begin with.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.993
I was prepared
to say she might have been.

12:40.026 --> 12:43.463
So what's changed?
that tape I just saw --
I hadn't seen it before,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.932
and clearly,
she is calm, composed.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.068
That doesn't mean
she wasn't in a rage.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.270
Maybe she was, but you're
asking me to testify

12:50.303 --> 12:52.138
she couldn't distinguish
right from wrong.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.807
I can't say that.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.476
She put her hands
up over her head very calmly

12:56.510 --> 12:58.078
after she fired those shots.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.080
That tells me she expected
to be arrested.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.149
It tells me she knew
what she was doing was wrong.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.219
Oh, come on.
this defense was a stretch
to begin with, Ellenor.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.354
I can't stretch it
that far.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.489
You have before.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.024
No, I haven't, Eugene,

13:11.057 --> 13:12.492
and certainly
not on television.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.494
I have a professional
reputation, too.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.096
You ever think about that?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.831
Think about it?
we're paying you for it.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.032
We gave you $10,000.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.366
I'll refund the money.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.202
-You can't jump ship like this.
-You're our only
expert witness.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.437
I am not
about to commit perjury,

13:24.470 --> 13:28.108
and if I testified
I thought your client
was temporarily insane,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.943
I would be doing so.

13:31.177 --> 13:34.080
If you don't testify,
she could be facing life.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.951
Your client
committed murder, Ellenor.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.054
You don't want
to be introducing my opinion.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.063
Now what?

13:51.632 --> 13:53.433
We get Dr. Lanning.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.601
Dr. Dope?

13:54.635 --> 13:59.072
At least he'll say
what we want.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.108
Let's page him. He should be
here for Sally's testimony.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.145
This is just great.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.555
I think
I should take her cross.

14:14.588 --> 14:15.822
Why?
No offense.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.225
But I just think I'm able to
come off more sympathetic than
you.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.594
You -- sympathetic?

14:20.627 --> 14:22.596
Richard,
it's a woman on trial.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.997
She lost her daughter.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.632
I just think
it makes more sense

14:25.666 --> 14:28.268
to have a woman cross her,

14:28.301 --> 14:31.605
and, yes, I think
I can go softer than you.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.340
It's not your strength.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.677
How close am I to losing
my job, Helen?

14:36.710 --> 14:39.546
I didn't say you were
about to lose your job.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.015
Just that I'm under review.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.217
Let's just forget about ego.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.253
Let's just concentrate
on getting this conviction.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.963
And your social security?

14:56.997 --> 15:01.034
062-36-0749.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.971
Okay,
first marriage for both?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.707
-Yes.
-Fine.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.076
And do we have copies
of our blood tests?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.184
Excellent.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.586
Okay, uh, ahem,

15:19.620 --> 15:21.655
this is an aids
education pamphlet,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.690
which I am required under
Massachusetts law to give you.

15:23.724 --> 15:24.691
Fine.

15:24.725 --> 15:28.128
-Um, would you like
one of your own?
-Fine.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.230
Okay, I think
that about does it.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.298
Oh, Lindsay middle name?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.499
Susan.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.669
Lindsay Susan.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.438
Oh, your initials are LSD.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.007
Isn't that funny?

15:45.211 --> 15:48.081
Alright,
I just need $25 in cash.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.319
Excellent.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.523
Okay, here you go.

15:56.557 --> 15:59.526
Have a wonderful marriage.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.596
Whew.

16:02.629 --> 16:07.200
She had been missing for two
days when I got the call from
the police.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.301
The call?

16:08.334 --> 16:12.405
They said they thought
they had found my daughter,

16:12.438 --> 16:16.276
and they asked if I would go
to the coroner's office

16:16.309 --> 16:17.678
to identify her.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.746
And did you go?

16:19.780 --> 16:23.149
Yes.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.486
They took me into a room

16:26.520 --> 16:29.590
and showed me her body.

16:32.526 --> 16:35.095
And she was dead?

16:35.128 --> 16:39.232
Yes.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.135
Did you make
the identification?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.639
Yes.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.308
Do you have
any other children, Sally?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.577
No.

16:50.611 --> 16:53.313
And Jessica's father?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.315
He died three years ago.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.317
At some point
you became aware

16:57.350 --> 17:01.454
that Mr. Whittier was
a suspect in Jessica's death?

17:01.487 --> 17:02.188
Yes.

17:02.222 --> 17:06.459
I saw it
on the morning news...

17:06.492 --> 17:09.596
That his psychiatrist
had turned him in

17:09.630 --> 17:12.265
and the police
were planning to arrest him.

17:12.298 --> 17:16.336
Had you ever met
Mr. Whittier before?

17:16.368 --> 17:19.506
Yes.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.347
He was
Jessica's soccer coach.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.483
I would like for you
to tell the court

17:30.517 --> 17:33.453
what happened
on that morning.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.558
I took my gun.

17:37.591 --> 17:42.095
I drove to his house.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.498
I saw that the police
were already there.

17:45.532 --> 17:51.104
I parked my car
two houses away...

17:51.137 --> 17:53.439
And I waited.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.775
Waited for what?

17:54.808 --> 17:56.510
For him to come out.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.512
Why?

17:58.545 --> 18:01.447
So I could kill him.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.117
Can you tell the court

18:04.150 --> 18:07.287
what you were thinking
when you approached him?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.226
Sally?

18:18.699 --> 18:22.168
I was thinking about...

18:22.202 --> 18:24.571
(moaning)

18:24.605 --> 18:27.207
about Jessica...

18:30.443 --> 18:35.516
Her last minutes...

18:35.549 --> 18:39.385
How she probably
couldn't understand

18:39.419 --> 18:42.094
why this
was happening to her...

18:46.226 --> 18:49.630
What was going
through her mind

18:49.663 --> 18:54.167
when his hands
were around her throat...

18:58.939 --> 19:00.507
When he was...

19:03.910 --> 19:08.915
When he was inside of her.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.354
She was only 7.

19:14.387 --> 19:20.360
She was only 7.

19:20.393 --> 19:25.532
SALLY: (sobbing)

19:54.928 --> 19:57.363
Do you want
to marry her or not?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.566
Of course I want
to marry her.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.834
Then act like it.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.569
What have I done?

20:02.603 --> 20:05.371
You've done nothing, Bobby.
that's the problem.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.241
She shows you her dress.
You hardly glance at it.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.476
The invitations --
you couldn't be bothered.

20:10.511 --> 20:12.679
You've completely disengaged.
I don't blame her.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.815
All that stuff
is so trivial.

20:14.848 --> 20:16.750
It's a big deal to her.

20:16.783 --> 20:20.821
Bobby, this is
the biggest day of her life.

20:20.854 --> 20:23.557
That should mean
something to you.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.691
Does it?

20:24.725 --> 20:26.026
Of course it does.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.694
Then show her that.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.495
We're in may.
you've got a June wedding.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.898
You haven't even
picked out your best man yet.

20:31.932 --> 20:34.868
Look at me.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.803
You're always on the hustle.

20:36.837 --> 20:39.673
Don't let your wedding day
suddenly sneak up on you.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.608
You're always
dashing off to court

20:41.642 --> 20:44.745
trying to get this guy free,
trying to get that guy bail,

20:44.778 --> 20:46.880
trying to overturn what
happened to the other guy.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.383
Lindsay's your life.

20:50.851 --> 20:53.687
I know that.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.790
Show her that, too.

20:59.993 --> 21:03.463
How many days
after your daughter's death

21:03.496 --> 21:05.465
did you see on the news

21:05.498 --> 21:07.400
that the police
were about to make an arrest?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.670
INTERPRETER: Three.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.672
And after hearing this news,

21:11.705 --> 21:14.340
you then retrieved your gun?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.942
Yes.

21:15.976 --> 21:17.944
You then called
your real estate broker

21:17.978 --> 21:20.346
and canceled your appointment?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.549
Yes.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.552
Then you drove
to the suspect's house?

21:25.586 --> 21:27.087
Yes.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.423
And you decided to park
at a neighbor's house

21:30.456 --> 21:34.761
so you wouldn't be detected
by the police?

21:34.795 --> 21:37.363
Yes.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.966
Where do you keep your gun
at home, Ms. Berg?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.703
In a safe.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.971
A combination safe?

21:45.005 --> 21:46.439
Yes.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.774
Do you keep it loaded?

21:47.808 --> 21:51.512
No, I have to load it.

21:51.545 --> 21:54.380
Thank you.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.449
Ms. Berg...

21:56.482 --> 22:00.854
I am deeply sorry
for your loss.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.590
You're here to put me
in prison, Ms. Gamble.

22:03.624 --> 22:05.592
Don't tell me
how sorry you are.

22:05.626 --> 22:09.530
Unless you've had a child
taken from you,

22:09.563 --> 22:12.966
you can't begin
to understand my loss.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.545
JUDGE HILLER: Ms. Frutt.

22:24.578 --> 22:27.080
The witness may step down.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.050
Please call your next witness.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.656
The defense rests.

22:42.596 --> 22:45.632
Explain that to me.

22:45.666 --> 22:48.569
I will.
We don't even
call an expert. how --

22:48.602 --> 22:49.703
Sally was
our strongest witness.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.705
Better to rest on her
than Dr. Dope,

22:51.738 --> 22:54.107
who Helen would've cleaned
and boned like a trout.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.042
We need somebody
to say she was insane.

22:56.076 --> 22:57.911
No, we don't.
yes, we do.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.913
We have an affirmative
defense, Eugene.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.915
We have a legal burden
to prove it.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.917
Ellenor,
our case won't depend

23:03.950 --> 23:05.919
on proving Sally Berg
was insane.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.054
Everybody in the room
knows she wasn't.

23:08.088 --> 23:10.591
We know it, the prosecution
knows it, so does the jury.

23:10.624 --> 23:13.059
Our case is getting
those 12 people

23:13.093 --> 23:14.661
to want to send her home.

23:14.695 --> 23:16.863
And Sally's testimony
is what we need

23:16.897 --> 23:19.199
to ring in their ears,
not Dr. Lanning,

23:19.232 --> 23:21.467
who goes from courthouse
to courthouse

23:21.502 --> 23:23.469
collecting cashier's checks.

23:23.504 --> 23:25.471
Our defense is emotion.

23:25.506 --> 23:27.541
We rest
on the highest note.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.075
I agree.

23:29.109 --> 23:31.612
You're forgetting judge Hiller.
she is going to instruct.

23:31.645 --> 23:33.614
If our case came down
to Dr. Lanning,

23:33.647 --> 23:34.815
we'd be dead.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.883
He's right, Ellenor.
temp insanity --

23:36.917 --> 23:40.821
we're just arguing that
with a wink. The jury knows it.

23:40.854 --> 23:43.890
If we try to fool them,
we just lose credibility.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.458
Eugene's right.

23:48.529 --> 23:50.831
It's a big risk.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.600
But we have to take it.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.238
You ready to close?

23:58.271 --> 24:01.675
Well, I guess I have to be.

24:12.152 --> 24:14.988
That was very moving
for me --

24:15.021 --> 24:18.058
getting the marriage
license.

24:18.091 --> 24:20.627
How was it for you?

24:23.897 --> 24:25.932
Why are we fighting?

24:25.966 --> 24:27.601
We always seem to fight

24:27.634 --> 24:29.069
when we talk
about getting married.

24:29.102 --> 24:30.671
Why?

24:30.704 --> 24:32.038
I don't know.

24:34.708 --> 24:36.610
Do you want
to get married, Bobby?

24:36.643 --> 24:40.614
Lindsay,
I would marry you tonight.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.149
I just --
I just hate weddings,

24:43.183 --> 24:46.019
and I'd be lying
if I said

24:46.052 --> 24:48.955
I was getting all excited
about this ceremony.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.691
How can a person
hate weddings?

24:50.724 --> 24:53.627
Because it's all about
the catering

24:53.660 --> 24:56.096
and dresses and flowers
and who's invited

24:56.129 --> 24:57.964
and who's sitting
at whose table.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.966
It should be
the most intimate moment

25:00.000 --> 25:01.635
of a couple's life,

25:01.668 --> 25:03.303
and they spend
the day hoping

25:03.336 --> 25:05.305
that the guests
are taken care of.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.841
There's so much pressure
that everything go smoothly.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.611
I hate weddings.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.882
There I said it.

25:18.585 --> 25:22.556
But marriage...

25:22.589 --> 25:24.991
I can't wait for that.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.297
Would you really
rather elope?

25:31.331 --> 25:33.700
Truthfully, yes.

25:33.734 --> 25:36.703
It would be me and you
without all the distractions,

25:36.737 --> 25:37.971
but I know you want
the big wedding day,

25:38.004 --> 25:40.073
-and if that'syour dream --
-I wish it were your dream.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.908
Lindsay, I've only had
two dreams my whole life.

25:41.942 --> 25:43.076
One was to pitch
for the Red Sox.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.579
The other
was to meet and marry

25:45.612 --> 25:48.882
the greatest woman
in the whole world.

25:51.284 --> 25:54.655
One for two isn't bad.

25:54.688 --> 25:57.858
Now, if I could just get you
to take a little medication

25:57.891 --> 25:59.660
for your mood swings...

25:59.693 --> 26:01.895
-Is that so?
-Ow, ow, ohh.
okay, okay, uncle.

26:15.642 --> 26:19.880
I suppose we could pass a law.

26:19.913 --> 26:23.684
If you kill my child,
I get to kill you.

26:23.717 --> 26:27.688
If you rape my child,
I get to kill you.

26:27.721 --> 26:30.757
On a pure emotional level,

26:30.791 --> 26:34.628
that doesn't really offend me,
truth be told.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.096
On an emotional level,

26:36.129 --> 26:39.032
I admit to taking
some satisfaction

26:39.065 --> 26:41.167
in Michael Whittier's death,

26:41.201 --> 26:43.770
if he did
what he was accused of.

26:43.804 --> 26:48.308
I say "if"
because I'm not sure yet.

26:48.341 --> 26:52.646
Michael Whittier
never got his day in court.

26:52.679 --> 26:56.650
He was executed
before proven guilty.

26:56.683 --> 27:00.654
None of us can take
any satisfaction in that

27:00.687 --> 27:03.657
emotionally or intellectually.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.126
One of the reasons
we have laws

27:06.159 --> 27:09.796
is to prevent people
from going around with guns

27:09.830 --> 27:13.700
being ruled by their emotions.

27:13.734 --> 27:16.803
I sympathize with Sally Berg,

27:16.837 --> 27:20.140
as I know you do,

27:20.173 --> 27:25.145
but she wasn't acting
out of insanity on that day.

27:25.178 --> 27:29.950
She made a series
of conscious choices.

27:29.983 --> 27:34.087
She had the steadiness of hand
to open a combination lock,

27:34.120 --> 27:36.156
to load a revolver,

27:36.189 --> 27:40.360
to drive a car through traffic
without incident.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.428
She had the presence of mind

27:42.462 --> 27:45.431
to park where she could avoid
police detection.

27:45.465 --> 27:49.435
She had an understanding
that what she did was illegal,

27:49.469 --> 27:52.438
as indicated by her raising
her hands in surrender

27:52.472 --> 27:55.909
immediately after firing
the shots.

27:55.942 --> 28:00.380
She willfully, deliberately,

28:00.413 --> 28:03.717
with malice aforethought,

28:03.750 --> 28:07.253
committed a premeditated murder.

28:07.287 --> 28:10.991
I don't think
there's any doubt about that.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.860
The only real question here

28:13.894 --> 28:16.863
is whether you'll embrace
her vigilantism

28:16.897 --> 28:20.333
by becoming vigilantes
yourselves

28:20.366 --> 28:25.433
or you'll instead uphold
the law you swore to uphold.

28:26.507 --> 28:31.411
This is your trial now,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:31.444 --> 28:35.448
This is your society.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.772
I am not a psychiatrist,

28:58.805 --> 29:01.441
and neither is Mr. Bay,

29:01.474 --> 29:06.279
but I know of no medical
opinions or studies

29:06.312 --> 29:10.734
that say rage automatically
makes you act wildly.

29:12.553 --> 29:16.790
Sometimes,
if the rage is profound enough,

29:16.823 --> 29:20.460
I would imagine
it could take you over

29:20.493 --> 29:23.329
to a point
where you are even capable

29:23.363 --> 29:27.534
of cold methodical vengeance.

29:27.568 --> 29:32.098
This is the kind
of profound rage and grief

29:33.840 --> 29:37.477
that took over Sally Berg.

29:37.511 --> 29:40.480
I won't pretend to know

29:40.514 --> 29:42.482
what was going on
inside her head.

29:42.516 --> 29:47.020
I have never had a child
raped and murdered,

29:47.053 --> 29:49.890
and I would guess
none of us here

29:49.923 --> 29:54.928
would presume
to know such horror.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.508
This is Jessica Berg.

30:07.541 --> 30:13.379
She loved to collect
and trade PokÃ©mon cards.

30:13.413 --> 30:17.117
She liked her stuffed animals
more than her dolls.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.253
She...

30:20.286 --> 30:25.358
She loved to play soccer.

30:29.563 --> 30:33.199
I would like
to take a moment,

30:33.233 --> 30:37.638
and I would ask you
to try and imagine

30:37.671 --> 30:41.842
the last few minutes
of her life.

31:25.018 --> 31:28.021
Imagine being her mother.

32:05.592 --> 32:06.960
REBECCA:
You're going to elope?

32:06.993 --> 32:09.362
Shh, he'll hear you.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.133
Well, isn't he going
to be part of it?

32:13.166 --> 32:15.201
I'm going to surprise him.

32:15.235 --> 32:17.538
You're going to throw
a surprise elopement?

32:17.571 --> 32:19.540
This is the best way to handle
those 390 invitations.

32:19.573 --> 32:21.742
We elope and tell people
that we're already married,

32:21.775 --> 32:23.710
and then we can have
a small ceremony later

32:23.744 --> 32:26.279
and invite the people
that we really want.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.248
Am I on that list?

32:28.281 --> 32:30.216
Lindsay are you
sure about this?

32:30.250 --> 32:31.417
I'm sure.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.119
But I need you
two to pull it off.

32:33.754 --> 32:35.722
-Tonight?
-Tonight.

32:35.756 --> 32:38.525
Like in three hours
from right now?

32:38.559 --> 32:39.425
Yes.

32:40.627 --> 32:43.196
Oh, my god.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.966
(giggles) Yeah.

32:51.471 --> 32:53.574
If I lose this trial
because you cried...

32:53.607 --> 32:55.275
They didn't see me cry.

32:55.308 --> 32:56.376
They saw you cover
your face.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.378
I doubt they thought you were
trying to hide a pimple.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.180
The problem isn't me crying.

33:00.213 --> 33:05.018
The problem is there were tears
in the jurors' eyes.

33:09.189 --> 33:13.359
Look, Ellenor said
she'd still be willing

33:13.393 --> 33:15.395
to take involuntary.

33:16.797 --> 33:19.032
I think we should
give it to them.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.634
I thought they said no
to that upstairs.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.636
If she walks,
they'll hate that worse.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.304
I'll talk to Scott.

33:24.337 --> 33:25.438
No.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.575
Helen, if we plead out
on involuntary,

33:28.609 --> 33:31.311
the perception upstairs
will be I lost.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.347
I need a guilty here.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.117
This can't be
about job security.

33:37.150 --> 33:39.653
Easy for you.
you're not under review.

33:39.686 --> 33:41.387
Richard.

33:41.421 --> 33:45.058
She committed a first-degree
murder, Helen.

33:45.091 --> 33:48.328
I don't want
to give her involuntary,

33:48.361 --> 33:50.631
and I don't
want to lose my job.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.477
How long
do we have to wait?

34:04.511 --> 34:08.348
The judge is going to keep them
till 9:00 since it's Friday,

34:08.380 --> 34:11.417
and if they
haven't decided by then,

34:11.451 --> 34:13.219
they're going to suspend
until Monday.

34:13.253 --> 34:16.489
This is killing me.

34:16.523 --> 34:19.458
Me, too.

34:26.466 --> 34:28.434
Richard said no
to involuntary.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.436
Why?

34:30.469 --> 34:31.572
Principle, I guess.

34:31.605 --> 34:33.306
You can overrule him,
Helen.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.510
It's his call.

34:36.543 --> 34:37.710
Ellenor,

34:37.744 --> 34:41.481
can I talk to you in private
for a second?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.388
I just talked to Lindsay.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.291
She and Bobby
are getting married tonight.

34:51.324 --> 34:53.860
-What?
-She's surprising him
with an elopement.

34:53.893 --> 34:56.196
Oh, men just love
to be surprised like that.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.097
Are you serious?

34:57.130 --> 34:58.865
Yes. she says
she wants us to be there.

34:58.899 --> 35:00.534
I said we could be here
till 9:00.

35:00.567 --> 35:02.135
She's going to try
to hold the service,

35:02.168 --> 35:04.137
but the priest
has got a plane to catch.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.672
Is she pregnant?

35:05.706 --> 35:08.341
No. she says this is what
he really wants.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.210
She wants to surprise him.

35:10.243 --> 35:11.678
Helen, Ellenor...

35:11.712 --> 35:14.848
The jury is back.

35:36.336 --> 35:37.771
Thank you.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.807
The defendant
will please rise.

35:45.278 --> 35:46.713
Madame Foreperson,

35:46.747 --> 35:49.816
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

35:49.850 --> 35:51.217
We have, your honor.

35:51.251 --> 35:52.553
What say you?

35:52.586 --> 35:54.821
Commonwealth
vs Sally Berg --

35:54.855 --> 35:58.825
on the count of murder
in the first degree,

35:58.859 --> 36:00.994
we find the defendant
not guilty.

36:04.865 --> 36:08.234
On the count of murder
in the second degree,

36:08.268 --> 36:11.538
we find
the defendant guilty.

36:14.741 --> 36:17.844
Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

36:17.878 --> 36:21.582
Security,
take the defendant into custody.

36:21.615 --> 36:23.283
We're adjourned.

36:35.829 --> 36:37.731
Sally,

36:37.764 --> 36:39.800
we're going to appeal.

36:39.833 --> 36:42.869
We will appeal it.

36:42.903 --> 36:45.338
What's the sentence?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.741
It's a life sentence,

36:47.774 --> 36:51.011
but we're going to do
everything that we can.

36:51.044 --> 36:53.046
I promise.

36:56.917 --> 36:58.985
I promise.

37:28.649 --> 37:30.817
Alright enough is enough.

37:30.851 --> 37:32.553
Wha--What the
hell is going on?

37:32.586 --> 37:33.654
Well, this is
your bachelor party.

37:33.687 --> 37:34.721
Bachelor party?

37:34.755 --> 37:36.823
Rebecca, guys are supposed
to throw bachelor parties.

37:36.857 --> 37:38.825
Yeah, well, we just wanted
to make sure you got one.

37:38.859 --> 37:40.894
You know, sometimes weddings
can just sneak up on you,

37:40.927 --> 37:44.030
and how sad would it be if you
didn't get to have -- ow!

37:44.064 --> 37:45.298
What happened?

37:45.331 --> 37:46.733
Rebecca just hit me.

37:46.767 --> 37:47.768
Where am I?

37:47.801 --> 37:49.570
All right, all right,
all right, turn around.

37:49.603 --> 37:50.704
Should I give the signal?

37:50.737 --> 37:52.506
-No, not yet.
-What signal?

37:52.539 --> 37:56.042
Okay, take your blindfold off.
Now, Lucy!

38:03.684 --> 38:07.854
What?
I'm in Fenway Park?

38:07.888 --> 38:10.323
Yes, you are.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.457
But why?
what am I doing here?

38:11.491 --> 38:13.059
Well, you're doing
what everybody does
in Fenway park.

38:13.093 --> 38:14.394
You're eloping.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.396
Excuse me?

38:16.429 --> 38:17.898
You're eloping.

38:23.704 --> 38:27.608
Oh, my god.

38:27.641 --> 38:30.043
Oh, my god.

38:39.653 --> 38:42.388
Is this for real?

38:42.422 --> 38:44.591
If you want it to be.

38:45.926 --> 38:47.561
FATHER MARTIN:
Hey, Bobby.

38:47.594 --> 38:48.762
You can do this?

38:48.795 --> 38:52.398
I got special permission
from the bishop.

38:52.432 --> 38:53.767
And this would be official?

38:53.800 --> 38:54.835
Like Pearl Harbor.

38:54.868 --> 38:55.736
Quiet.

38:58.038 --> 38:59.873
It would be official.

38:59.906 --> 39:02.743
I figured we could have
a more traditional ceremony

39:02.776 --> 39:04.611
a little later with our families
and close friends,

39:04.645 --> 39:05.712
but tonight

39:05.746 --> 39:08.114
I thought you might like
to pitch for the Red Sox.

39:08.148 --> 39:09.349
I'll catch.

39:11.518 --> 39:14.755
I don't mean to rush,
but I've got a 10:00 flight.

39:14.788 --> 39:16.890
You're not rushing.
I want you to do this right.

39:16.923 --> 39:18.625
Are you sure?

39:22.529 --> 39:24.665
Let's get married.

39:24.698 --> 39:26.132
JIMMY: Hold on!

39:26.166 --> 39:27.167
HELEN:
Did we miss it?

39:27.200 --> 39:28.535
You're about to.

39:28.569 --> 39:30.470
HELEN: Oh, god,
I'm going to cry.

39:30.504 --> 39:32.739
In addition to the flight,
I'm getting old.

39:32.773 --> 39:34.474
Can we...

39:34.508 --> 39:36.476
Okay, ready --
if you are.

39:36.510 --> 39:38.812
I do -- I am.

39:38.845 --> 39:39.880
JIMMY: Look --
they're on the scoreboard.

39:39.913 --> 39:45.485
Please.

39:45.519 --> 39:46.419
Father.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.488
Okay.

39:48.522 --> 39:50.824
Now, this obviously
is not a cathedral

39:50.857 --> 39:52.826
known for its happy endings,

39:52.859 --> 39:56.830
but Fenway Park
certainly is a symbol

39:56.863 --> 40:02.703
of a deep lifelong
commitment of joy...

40:02.736 --> 40:04.705
And of pain.

40:04.738 --> 40:05.806
Father.

40:08.875 --> 40:09.876
I, Bobby...

40:12.879 --> 40:14.681
I, Bobby...

40:14.715 --> 40:16.149
Take thee, Lindsay...

40:16.182 --> 40:17.884
Take thee, Lindsay...

40:17.918 --> 40:19.686
To be my wedded wife,

40:19.720 --> 40:21.722
to have and to hold...

40:21.755 --> 40:24.190
To be my wedded wife,

40:24.224 --> 40:25.892
to have and to hold...

40:25.926 --> 40:28.729
From this day forward,
for better, for worse...

40:28.762 --> 40:30.731
From this day forward,
for better, for worse,

40:30.764 --> 40:33.199
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and health --

40:33.233 --> 40:36.436
I've been memorizing this
for a long time.

40:37.604 --> 40:41.842
To love
and to cherish...

40:41.875 --> 40:46.212
Till death us do part.

40:46.246 --> 40:49.482
This is my solemn vow.

40:53.186 --> 40:55.088
Well...

40:55.121 --> 40:57.490
I, Lindsay...

40:57.524 --> 40:58.692
I, Lindsay...

40:58.725 --> 41:00.827
Uh, you haven't memorized this,
have you?

41:00.861 --> 41:01.828
I need a little help.

41:01.862 --> 41:03.564
All right --

41:03.597 --> 41:06.232
take thee, Bobby,
to be my wedded husband...

41:06.266 --> 41:08.935
Take thee, bobby,
to be my wedded husband...

41:08.969 --> 41:11.738
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

41:11.772 --> 41:14.608
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

41:14.641 --> 41:17.811
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer...

41:17.844 --> 41:20.547
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer...

41:20.581 --> 41:22.148
In sickness
and in health,

41:22.182 --> 41:24.284
to love
and to cherish...

41:24.317 --> 41:28.555
In sickness and in health,
to love and to cherish...

41:28.589 --> 41:30.891
Till death do us part...

41:30.924 --> 41:33.927
Till death do us part.

41:35.796 --> 41:37.831
Do you have the rings?

41:37.864 --> 41:40.033
Not yet.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.302
Oh, all right.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.838
Then by the powers
vested in me

41:44.871 --> 41:47.941
under the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, under God --

41:47.974 --> 41:50.911
and I suppose
under the Boston Red Sox --

41:50.944 --> 41:54.881
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

41:56.617 --> 41:59.052
I guess that means
he's off the market now.

41:59.085 --> 42:02.322
Whoo!

42:02.355 --> 42:05.959
Whoo!

42:11.297 --> 42:12.933
I love you.

42:12.966 --> 42:14.801
I love you.

42:14.835 --> 42:17.871
Do we all get to go
on the honeymoon?

42:17.904 --> 42:20.807
One toast.
thank you all for being here.

42:20.841 --> 42:22.809
It probably
goes without saying --

42:22.843 --> 42:26.212
which is good
because I never say it --

42:26.246 --> 42:30.016
but, uh,
you people are my best friends.

42:30.050 --> 42:34.755
You mean
the world to me...

42:34.788 --> 42:37.290
And, uh...

42:37.323 --> 42:39.893
This woman --

42:39.926 --> 42:42.763
she is my world,

42:42.796 --> 42:45.966
and people shouldn't cry
on baseball fields.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.834
Let's go.

42:47.868 --> 42:50.370
(all laughing)

42:50.403 --> 42:52.238
I love you.

42:52.272 --> 42:55.175
Obviously he's not
a Red Sox fan.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.910
Here -- you take it.

42:56.943 --> 42:58.912
No, I don't want it.

42:58.945 --> 43:00.180
Congratulations,
sweetie.

43:00.213 --> 43:01.915
Congratulations.

43:01.948 --> 43:04.618
I can't believe it.

44:10.316 --> 44:13.319
â™ª

44:36.810 --> 44:37.811
WOMAN: You stinker!
