<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:01.967 --> 00:03.566
<i>Catherine, in all those years</i>

00:03.607 --> 00:06.158
that I was watching over
you, all I ever wanted

00:06.159 --> 00:08.426
<i>was to meet you.</i>

00:08.428 --> 00:10.295
Vincent, you're
not a monster.

00:10.297 --> 00:12.764
<i>You saved my life.</i>

00:13.767 --> 00:15.800
Dad!

00:16.669 --> 00:17.869
Catherine's blood contained

00:17.871 --> 00:19.391
no common identifiers
with your father.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.661
I'm not quite following.

00:20.678 --> 00:22.758
There was no match between
Catherine and your father.

00:24.575 --> 00:26.158
<i>I was part</i>
<i>of a highly classified</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:28.276
<i>unit of super soldiers.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:30.796
These people from Muirfield,
they will not stop until

00:30.798 --> 00:32.715
<i>- they've buried their mess.</i>
<i>- Vincent, Muirfield is</i>

00:32.717 --> 00:33.916
<i>out there hunting you.</i>

00:43.560 --> 00:46.095
Vincent!

00:46.097 --> 00:48.814
Don't shoot!
She's my daughter.

02:23.327 --> 02:24.226
Forbes.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.278
JT?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.447
Oh. Hey, Cat.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.216
How's it going, at 5:00 a.m.?

02:31.218 --> 02:33.168
Just checking in to see if
you have any leads on Vincent.

02:33.170 --> 02:35.170
You mean since you asked me
eight hours ago?

02:35.172 --> 02:39.041
It wasn't eight hours,
it was... nine.

02:39.043 --> 02:42.344
Cat, this has been going on
for almost three months.

02:42.346 --> 02:44.913
Maybe you ought to--
I don't know--

02:44.915 --> 02:46.548
take a little break maybe.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.767
Anyway, anything?

02:53.056 --> 02:55.257
Okay, well, I'm still hacked in

02:55.259 --> 02:56.859
to the city's
surveillance cameras,

02:56.861 --> 03:00.646
scanning social media sites,
cross-checking his photo

03:00.648 --> 03:04.032
with facial recognition,
but so far, nada.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.485
Vincent is out there somewhere;
I know it, I feel it.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.704
Muirfield could've easily just
killed him, but they didn't.

03:08.706 --> 03:10.122
They captured him,

03:10.124 --> 03:11.773
which means that they need him
for something.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.742
Which means we're the only ones
who can save him

03:13.744 --> 03:14.993
from all the awful things

03:14.995 --> 03:16.462
that they've done to him.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.946
Come on, Cat,
don't you think I know that?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.131
I care about him, too!

03:19.133 --> 03:20.382
I mean, I've been trying

03:20.384 --> 03:22.050
to save Vincent
for, what, ten years?

03:22.052 --> 03:23.085
I owe him.

03:23.087 --> 03:24.920
But I love him.

03:24.922 --> 03:26.621
And I don't care
if it makes sense to you

03:26.623 --> 03:29.975
or to anybody else, I am not
gonna stop until I find him.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.762
And I don't care
if it makes sense to you

03:33.764 --> 03:35.264
I'm sorry.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.801
No, it's okay, I understand.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.021
It's just...

03:43.023 --> 03:45.474
I'll be honest,
I'm not just worried about him,

03:45.476 --> 03:46.975
I'm worried about you, too.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.861
I mean, you've got Vincent,

03:48.863 --> 03:51.363
all the craziness
at the precinct,

03:51.365 --> 03:53.198
your dad passing away.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.284
It's been what,
like, a month since the funeral?

03:55.286 --> 03:57.152
Okay, don't worry about me.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.754
Okay?

03:58.756 --> 04:02.424
Just... don't stop
looking for Vincent.

04:02.426 --> 04:03.976
Please.

04:11.384 --> 04:14.102
I don't know if you've noticed,
which you probably haven't

04:14.104 --> 04:16.021
'cause you've been mostly AWOL
around here lately--

04:16.023 --> 04:18.055
not that I'm complaining...
I'm sorry.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.892
The point is,

04:19.894 --> 04:21.276
the workload's doubled
ever since

04:21.278 --> 04:22.844
the D.A. overturned
Joe's cases.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.479
And although I'm used
to covering for you--

04:24.481 --> 04:26.014
again, not like I mind...

04:26.016 --> 04:27.032
No, you should.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.400
It's just...

04:28.402 --> 04:30.619
Look, I know how much
you love the guy,

04:30.621 --> 04:32.621
but I think I have
the right to know

04:32.623 --> 04:33.989
how much longer
this is gonna go on.

04:33.991 --> 04:35.824
Until I find him, Tess, okay?

04:35.826 --> 04:37.543
Right, but what if you can't?

04:40.463 --> 04:41.830
Look, I'm sorry.

04:41.832 --> 04:43.198
I'm your friend,
I'm allowed to blunt.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.383
It's one of the perks.

04:46.169 --> 04:50.005
Look, I don't want to be
the bad guy here, I don't,

04:50.007 --> 04:51.974
but you know
as well as I do

04:51.976 --> 04:54.376
that the odds of finding
a missing person after...

04:54.378 --> 04:56.044
You sound like JT.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.481
You guys ganging up on me?

04:59.483 --> 05:02.317
I'm not giving up
until I find him, Tess.

05:02.319 --> 05:03.819
That's funny.

05:03.821 --> 05:05.437
That's exactly what Joe said

05:05.439 --> 05:06.688
about finding
his brother's killer:

05:06.690 --> 05:08.190
"I'm not giving up."

05:08.192 --> 05:10.108
It was all he cared about,
but it kept him from

05:10.110 --> 05:11.893
focusing on
all the other cases,

05:11.895 --> 05:15.030
and that's what's caused
this mess and cost him his job.

05:15.032 --> 05:16.898
And me my boyfriend.

05:18.734 --> 05:22.087
Just make sure you know what
it's costing you, Cat, okay?

05:22.089 --> 05:23.839
Make sure it's worth it.

05:23.841 --> 05:27.926
I know what it's costing
me, Tess, believe me.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.464
Sometimes when I'm alone,

05:32.466 --> 05:34.416
and it's late and it's quiet,

05:34.418 --> 05:38.270
I just... I just want to cry.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.555
For Vincent,
for my Dad.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.107
But I can't.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.476
I won't let myself,
not until I find Vincent.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.861
I have to stay strong.

05:45.863 --> 05:46.928
It's a dangerous game,

05:46.930 --> 05:48.397
putting yourself
on hold like that.

05:48.399 --> 05:51.066
It's gonna catch up with you
sooner or later.

05:51.068 --> 05:52.651
I know.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.702
Catherine!

05:53.704 --> 05:55.871
Speaking of beasts.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.274
Catherine, I need
to talk to you.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.776
In private.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.778
<i>This better be good.</i>

06:03.780 --> 06:05.613
Because I don't care if
the D.A. put you in charge,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.215
I don't have to listen to you.
I know, but...

06:07.217 --> 06:09.001
Maybe I haven't been
around much lately,

06:09.003 --> 06:11.219
but you know what I'm doing,
and I don't expect any flak,

06:11.221 --> 06:13.505
because if I hadn't saved your
life, you wouldn't even be here.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.290
And you know
how grateful I am.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.958
And, honestly, when you
couldn't help me find Vincent,

06:16.960 --> 06:18.343
which was the only reason

06:18.345 --> 06:20.128
I saved your sorry ass
in the first place,

06:20.130 --> 06:21.680
I should've just left
well enough alone

06:21.682 --> 06:23.965
when your beast side died,
you know what I mean?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.851
No offense.
None taken.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.386
And, for the record...

06:27.388 --> 06:29.571
Catherine, JT found Vincent.

06:29.573 --> 06:33.241
He couldn't get in touch
with you, so he sent it to me.

06:33.243 --> 06:35.160
He sent what to you?

06:45.751 --> 06:49.751

06:55.049 --> 06:56.550
Are you sure
it's Vincent?

06:56.552 --> 06:58.001
Facial recognition's
still working on it.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.219
Wait, what?

06:59.221 --> 07:00.720
You said it was him
when you called.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.522
No, I said it might be him.

07:02.524 --> 07:04.624
Well, if you weren't sure,
then why did you send it over?

07:04.626 --> 07:06.510
I'm sorry, do we even like you?
Come on, come on.

07:06.512 --> 07:09.312
Well, you should test
the whole shot.

07:09.314 --> 07:11.448
Right.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.772
How long ago did you find this?

07:18.774 --> 07:21.458
Just before
I sent it to you guys.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.361
What? What kind of
software are you using?

07:24.363 --> 07:25.829
There's nothing
wrong with my software.

07:25.831 --> 07:27.130
Then why isn't
it finding a match?

07:27.132 --> 07:28.248
I don't know.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.466
Maybe 'cause it's not him.

07:29.468 --> 07:30.500
Let me try something.

07:30.502 --> 07:33.303
Don't touch my stuff.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.754
There a reason

07:34.756 --> 07:36.423
why you want it to
be Vincent so badly?

07:36.425 --> 07:38.058
I'm just saying,
last time, it was 'cause

07:38.060 --> 07:40.727
you wanted to kill him
so you could save yourself.

07:40.729 --> 07:43.213
What do I have to do to prove
I'm not a beast anymore?

07:43.215 --> 07:45.649
Maybe donate your body
to science?

07:45.651 --> 07:46.933
Catherine? What are you doing?

07:46.935 --> 07:48.318
Where are you going?

07:48.320 --> 07:51.021
Going to save Vincent,
or whoever that is.

07:55.611 --> 07:57.410
Come on, come on!

07:57.412 --> 07:59.062
Out of the way!

07:59.064 --> 08:02.449
Tess, I'm heading to
Brooklyn Shipyards, pier 48.

08:02.451 --> 08:04.501
I might need some backup.
What's your...

08:04.503 --> 08:05.535
Moron!

08:05.537 --> 08:06.503
...ETA?

08:06.505 --> 08:08.571
Cat, is that you?

08:08.573 --> 08:10.123
Heather?

08:10.125 --> 08:12.209
You know, I'd like to think

08:12.211 --> 08:16.713
that you're actually
returning my phone call finally,

08:16.715 --> 08:19.299
Heather, I am... I am so sorry.

08:19.301 --> 08:21.417
Um, just out of curiosity,

08:21.419 --> 08:24.137
when was the last time
you were home?

08:24.139 --> 08:26.022
I-I really don't have time
to explain right now.

08:26.024 --> 08:27.107
Can I call you back?

08:27.109 --> 08:28.091
Cat, that's the problem.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.392
You never have time anymore.

08:29.394 --> 08:30.927
Ever since the funeral,

08:30.929 --> 08:32.361
you've been, like,
impossible to get ahold of,

08:32.364 --> 08:34.063
and I'm worried about you.

08:34.066 --> 08:35.597
Are you, like,
undercover or something?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.817
Or something.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.986
Do you not see
the flashing light?!

08:41.039 --> 08:43.106
Cat, listen, I need to make sure

08:43.107 --> 08:44.491
that you're coming tonight,

08:44.493 --> 08:45.942
because I cannot
do this speech without you.

08:45.944 --> 08:47.460
What speech?

08:47.462 --> 08:49.629
At the tribute
Dad's law firm is throwing him.

08:49.631 --> 08:51.331
They're making him
a name partner, remember?

08:51.333 --> 08:53.133
Wait, that's-that's tonight?

08:53.135 --> 08:56.086
Cat, you promised
that you would be there.

08:56.088 --> 08:58.454
I know that you're busy and all,
but this is for Dad.

08:58.456 --> 09:00.507
This matters.

09:00.509 --> 09:03.093
Don't worry,
I'll be there, okay?

09:03.095 --> 09:05.145
Good. Um...

09:05.147 --> 09:07.597
And then maybe
we can talk afterwards.

09:07.599 --> 09:09.733
We-we really need to talk.

09:09.735 --> 09:12.986
It's about dad.

09:42.099 --> 09:45.518
You know, you should
be flattered.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.804
I wouldn't risk
coming out in the open

09:47.806 --> 09:49.556
for just anybody.

09:49.558 --> 09:52.342
But seeing as how many years
I've been looking for you...

09:54.145 --> 09:57.197
...I just wanted to make
sure it really was you.

10:02.119 --> 10:03.703
Look at me.

10:05.573 --> 10:07.791
Look at me.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.391
You do know who I am, right?

10:58.393 --> 11:00.491
Yeah. You're somebody
I want to kill.

11:00.516 --> 11:01.295
Why?

11:01.296 --> 11:04.264
Just because I'm the one
who turned you into a beast?

11:04.266 --> 11:06.466
Pretty good reason,
don't you think?

11:06.468 --> 11:09.969
I suppose if I was in
your shoes, I'd think the same.

11:09.971 --> 11:11.855
But in fairness,
back when I first

11:11.857 --> 11:13.723
took over Muirfield
from my dad,

11:13.725 --> 11:15.925
I was just a kid,

11:15.927 --> 11:18.194
a genetic scientist
looking for a job.

11:18.196 --> 11:22.449
Government knocked on my door,

11:22.451 --> 11:24.200
wallet in hand,

11:24.202 --> 11:26.870
asked me if I could build them
a super soldier.

11:26.872 --> 11:28.288
And here I am.

11:28.290 --> 11:29.539
And here you are.

11:29.541 --> 11:32.325
An experiment gone awry,
but nonetheless,

11:32.327 --> 11:35.879
a potentially profitable one
on the open market.

11:35.881 --> 11:40.417
You're a valuable weapon,
Mr. Keller,

11:40.419 --> 11:44.838
at least... now that
I've captured you.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.141
What makes you think
I didn't just capture <i>you?</i>

11:48.143 --> 11:51.794
Because... you're the one
in the cuffs.

11:51.796 --> 11:54.297
Alloy steal and titanium.

11:54.299 --> 11:56.149
You forget,

11:56.151 --> 11:58.852
I know exactly what
you're capable of.

11:58.854 --> 12:00.970
After all,

12:00.972 --> 12:02.739
I made you.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.161
Now it's time to make
you even more valuable.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.167
Stop him!

12:25.629 --> 12:28.164
Go.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.519
Where is he?!

12:32.521 --> 12:34.670
Do you see him?!

12:48.403 --> 12:49.786
Vincent?

12:49.788 --> 12:51.020
Thank God I found you!

13:03.502 --> 13:05.718
Vincent...

13:06.887 --> 13:08.721
Vincent.

13:11.676 --> 13:13.760
What, you followed me here?

13:13.762 --> 13:15.428
You got more darts in that thing?
Yeah.

13:15.430 --> 13:17.063
But one's all
we needed last...

13:17.065 --> 13:19.549
time.

13:24.321 --> 13:25.655
There he is!
Shoot him!

13:30.695 --> 13:32.862
That's impossible.

13:38.369 --> 13:39.569
Watch out!

13:46.344 --> 13:49.095
It's okay.
It's okay.

13:49.097 --> 13:50.246
It's over.

13:50.248 --> 13:52.015
Hey, you're going
to be okay.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.521
His scar's gone.

14:01.642 --> 14:04.777
All that matters is
that you're back, safe.

14:04.779 --> 14:08.031
I never stopped
looking for you.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.702
Who are you?

14:26.587 --> 14:27.850
At least let me

14:27.851 --> 14:29.701
stay until he wakes up,
just to be safe.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.737
I don't need you to
protect me from Vincent.

14:31.739 --> 14:34.022
Catherine, I know I haven't
earned your trust back yet,

14:34.024 --> 14:36.408
but the only way
I can truly make my amends

14:36.410 --> 14:38.994
is to keep trying,
and that starts with helping him

14:38.996 --> 14:41.213
and protecting you.

14:41.215 --> 14:42.881
We don't need your help.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.475
What?
Look, I don't like the guy any more

14:53.477 --> 14:56.061
than you do, but aren't you
a little concerned about what

14:56.063 --> 14:57.429
Muirfield did
to Vincent?

14:57.431 --> 14:58.897
I mean, let's face it.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.482
He clearly
different.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.900
And, frankly,
a little scary.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.003
Scary, JT, really?
What are you, like, six?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.822
Come on, it took
three tranq darts

15:06.824 --> 15:08.490
to stop him. Three.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.859
He didn't even
recognize you, Cat.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.914
Okay, where am I?

15:15.916 --> 15:17.699
It's okay,
it's okay. Just-just...

15:17.701 --> 15:19.451
take it eas...
take it easy.

15:19.453 --> 15:20.619
Okay, you're home.

15:20.621 --> 15:23.171
Home?

15:23.173 --> 15:25.707
Okay, just relax.

15:25.709 --> 15:28.677
Vincent, look at me.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.245
Do you remember me?

15:30.247 --> 15:32.180
I'm... I'm Cat.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.082
Catherine.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.535
Catherine.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.069
Yeah.

15:39.889 --> 15:42.440
No. Sorry.

15:43.976 --> 15:47.896
Okay. Uh, do you
know who he is?

15:47.898 --> 15:50.265
Your husband?

15:50.267 --> 15:53.819
Okay, look, you seem
like nice people,

15:53.821 --> 15:55.603
honestly,
you really do, and

15:55.605 --> 15:58.039
you are smoking hot,

15:58.041 --> 16:00.208
but, unfortunately,
I think you're confusing me

16:00.210 --> 16:02.377
with somebody else,
so I will just be...

16:03.747 --> 16:05.580
It's all right.

16:05.582 --> 16:08.466
It's all gonna come
back to you. Just...

16:08.468 --> 16:11.136
Do you remember
anything from the last

16:11.138 --> 16:13.338
three months?
Being captured?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.290
What happened to you?

16:15.292 --> 16:17.843
I got to go.

16:17.845 --> 16:20.262
Go? Go where?

16:21.797 --> 16:23.598
Recognize him, big guy?

16:23.600 --> 16:26.184
That's us, taken 11 years ago.

16:26.186 --> 16:31.740
Which means, you and I-- we've
known each other a long time.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.326
I completely lost
track of time.

16:51.328 --> 16:53.661
I promised my sister I'd be
there for my dad's tribute.

16:53.663 --> 16:55.347
It's okay. I got this.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.148
I'm serious.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.800
That's important. Go.

16:58.802 --> 17:00.501
I can't just leave Vincent,

17:00.503 --> 17:02.637
not after we finally found him.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.505
You're not leaving him.
I got him.

17:04.507 --> 17:07.642
All right.

17:07.644 --> 17:10.779
But whatever you do,
don't let him leave, promise.

17:10.781 --> 17:13.681
Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.

17:13.683 --> 17:16.284
Okay.

17:34.704 --> 17:38.056
I am telling you,
somebody set me up.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.258
Made me think
I'd finally found Keller

17:40.260 --> 17:42.543
so he could flush me out
into the open and kill me,

17:42.545 --> 17:44.279
and I want to know who!

17:44.281 --> 17:45.880
Well, first of all, Zhao,

17:45.882 --> 17:47.399
you don't tell me what to do.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.550
I don't work for you,
you work for me.

17:49.552 --> 17:50.902
You don't understand.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.737
Somebody's out
to get me, Reynolds.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.722
And whoever it is
stole my formula

17:54.724 --> 17:56.441
and turned Keller into the beast
that I was gonna turn him into!

17:56.443 --> 17:57.826
Look,

17:57.828 --> 17:59.577
maybe it's time
we shut Muirfield down.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.563
Shut Muirfield down?
I <i>am</i> Muirfield.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.749
Okay, listen to me.
Now, I've warned you before.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.201
As soon
as your experiments start

18:06.203 --> 18:07.735
getting out of control, we...

18:07.737 --> 18:09.504
My experiments have made us
both a lot of money,

18:09.506 --> 18:12.173
so don't threaten me.
And just so we're clear,

18:12.175 --> 18:14.242
if I go down,
you go down, too.

18:14.244 --> 18:17.012
The FBI came to me
15 years ago, okay,

18:17.014 --> 18:18.463
not the other way around.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.931
These may be my creations,

18:19.933 --> 18:22.150
but you're the ones
who wanted it black ops,

18:22.152 --> 18:23.852
so you try to shut me down,

18:23.854 --> 18:26.171
and I start talking
to the press, understand?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.023
Keller's worth a lot
of money to me,

18:28.025 --> 18:29.557
and I want him back.

18:31.261 --> 18:33.778
What happened?

18:33.780 --> 18:38.199
I don't know yet, but
Zhao is still alive.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.768
Does he know we set him up?
Not yet.

18:40.770 --> 18:43.321
We got to get Vincent to go
after him again. Otherwise,

18:43.323 --> 18:45.991
Zhao is gonna slither away for
good. Has Vincent checked in?

18:45.993 --> 18:47.826
No, he's not at the boat,
either.

18:47.828 --> 18:49.828
I don't even know where
to start looking for him.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.379
I think I do.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.915
Zhao said a cop got in the way
this morning.

18:53.917 --> 18:57.552
A female cop.

19:01.790 --> 19:04.426
Would you like to try this?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.516
Hey! There you are!

19:11.518 --> 19:14.436
Hey. I am so
sorry I'm late.

19:14.438 --> 19:15.687
Oh, it's okay, I'm just glad
that you're here.

19:15.689 --> 19:17.022
Look at you.
You look so beautiful!

19:17.024 --> 19:19.824
No, I just, uh, wanted
to dress up for Dad.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.945
So, uh, what is it you've been
trying to tell me so badly?

19:23.947 --> 19:28.333
Um, not here, Cat. Not now.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.035
It's too important,
but we'll talk after?

19:30.037 --> 19:31.453
I'm sorry.
Yeah. No.

19:31.455 --> 19:32.820
Could I borrow you for a sec?
Yeah, yeah. Oh.

19:32.822 --> 19:35.423
And don't forget,
you promised to speak

19:35.425 --> 19:36.758
for us tonight.
Yes.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.427
Okay.
Yeah.

19:49.839 --> 19:51.423
Ms. Chandler?

19:51.425 --> 19:53.391
I'm Bob Reynolds.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.343
I just wanted
to introduce myself,

19:55.345 --> 19:57.312
and let you know how sorry
I am for your loss.

19:57.314 --> 19:59.564
Your father was
a very good man.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.567
Thank you. Uh,
how'd you know him?

20:02.569 --> 20:06.454
Mm, crossed paths on a couple
of cases over the years.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.656
I'm an FBI Agent.
Really?

20:08.658 --> 20:12.744
Wow. Uh, Dad never mentioned
he worked with the FBI.

20:12.746 --> 20:14.588
Yeah, he probably
didn't want to bore you.

20:14.613 --> 20:15.965
Yeah.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.698
He said you're a detective,
is that right?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.334
Yeah, I'm over
at the 125th.

20:19.336 --> 20:20.769
Oh. You homicide? Vice?

20:20.771 --> 20:23.204
No, I actually
used to be

20:23.206 --> 20:25.540
special crimes,
but, um, right now,

20:25.542 --> 20:28.560
I'm just helping out with
a missing persons case.

20:28.562 --> 20:31.312
Ah, missing persons.

20:31.314 --> 20:34.799
They're sometimes
the most frustrating.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.151
And heartbreaking.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.820
Tell me about it.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.557
Um... it was
nice to meet you.

20:42.559 --> 20:44.242
You, too.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.228
By the way...

20:48.981 --> 20:52.283
You should know that your dad
talked about you all the time.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.185
He was super proud of you.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.638
Worried, but proud.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.756
Worried how?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.126
I don't know.
He never would say.

21:01.128 --> 21:02.877
I always just assumed he didn't
like your boyfriend or something.

21:02.879 --> 21:04.863
Fathers never think
anybody's good enough

21:04.865 --> 21:06.681
for their daughters.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.583
How true.

21:08.585 --> 21:11.186
Yeah.

21:21.147 --> 21:24.432
I think I know
where Vincent is.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.455
So, do we, uh, entertain a lot?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.273
No, no. We just have

21:32.275 --> 21:34.325
a very big bar.
And the vault.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.277
What are these,
safe deposit boxes?

21:36.279 --> 21:37.778
What do we use these for?

21:37.780 --> 21:39.998
Uh, well, actually...

21:40.000 --> 21:44.118
Are you sure you don't remember
any of this?

21:44.120 --> 21:46.921
If I did, would I be asking?

21:46.923 --> 21:49.457
No, uh, sorry, never mind.

21:49.459 --> 21:51.809
Uh, the truth
is, this...

21:51.811 --> 21:54.512
you know, used to be a
gentlemen's club a long time ago

21:54.514 --> 21:59.067
and it was just sitting
around empty, so we...

21:59.069 --> 22:01.269
moved in.

22:01.271 --> 22:03.137
Just the two of us?

22:03.139 --> 22:05.273
Yep, just you and me.

22:07.309 --> 22:09.644
But a-as friends.

22:09.646 --> 22:13.114
Good friends,
best friends but friends.

22:13.116 --> 22:14.966
Only. Just.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.451
This isn't

22:16.453 --> 22:19.170
helping, is it?

22:19.172 --> 22:21.973
What about the girl?

22:21.975 --> 22:25.159
The girl? You mean... Cat?

22:25.161 --> 22:27.262
Yeah, she made it
sound like were...

22:27.264 --> 22:30.014
close or something.
I mean, were we?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.884
No, you <i>are</i> close.

22:32.886 --> 22:34.602
Seriously,
it's like...

22:34.604 --> 22:36.304
borderline epic.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.860
What do you remember?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.312
About anything.

22:44.314 --> 22:46.114
I mean, y-you seemed to...

22:46.116 --> 22:48.316
know what you were doing
at the warehouse this morning.

22:48.318 --> 22:50.251
Which means,
by definition,

22:50.253 --> 22:53.738
you must've stored and processed
something in your memory banks.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.708
Look, you seem
like a nice guy.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.876
But, honestly, if you
keep asking me questions,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.828
I'm gonna have
to break your neck,

23:00.830 --> 23:02.196
so, you know...

23:02.198 --> 23:04.499
I wouldn't.

23:11.206 --> 23:12.707
Hello?

23:12.709 --> 23:14.875
I'm sorry, who?

23:14.877 --> 23:17.729
Condor? No, uh,
you got the wrong number.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.046
I got to go.

23:19.048 --> 23:21.232
What? No, y-you can't go.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.017
Sorry, I'm late.
Late?

23:23.019 --> 23:24.218
Late for what? No.

23:24.220 --> 23:25.486
Vincent, you have to stay.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.604
I promised Cat.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.607
Tell her you couldn't stop me.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.748
Please don't make me

23:36.750 --> 23:39.000
shoot you again.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.850
What? What-what is it?

23:57.085 --> 23:58.436
Why are you smiling?

24:01.974 --> 24:04.091
On his own dime and time,

24:04.093 --> 24:06.644
Thomas did more
pro bono work

24:06.646 --> 24:09.230
than any lawyer I know
and, for that and more,

24:09.232 --> 24:12.066
we honor his name on
our letterhead tonight

24:12.068 --> 24:13.735
and from now on.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.908
JT, is everything all right?

24:20.910 --> 24:22.293
No, actually.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.295
Vincent's gone.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.781
What? How could
you let this happen?

24:26.783 --> 24:29.450
I didn't really...

24:29.452 --> 24:32.387
have a choice.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.287
And now...

24:34.556 --> 24:36.140
Did he say where he was going?

24:37.227 --> 24:38.343
...daughter, Catherine,
to say a few words

24:38.345 --> 24:39.627
on behalf of
his family.

24:39.629 --> 24:40.978
Cat?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.680
JT, talk to me, damn it.

24:42.682 --> 24:43.931
Sorry.

24:43.933 --> 24:46.150
Can't.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.653
JT? JT?

24:48.655 --> 24:51.239
JT?

24:52.140 --> 24:55.142
I am so sorry.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.572
I still can't believe
Vincent tranq'd you.

25:04.752 --> 25:06.885
He would never
do that to you. Here.

25:06.887 --> 25:09.171
Well, maybe not
the old Vincent.

25:10.173 --> 25:11.807
He's gone, Cat.

25:11.809 --> 25:12.925
I know he's gone, JT.

25:12.927 --> 25:13.926
No, I mean

25:13.928 --> 25:15.710
he's gone mentally.

25:15.712 --> 25:19.064
Far as I can tell, he can't
remember anything about you,

25:19.066 --> 25:22.935
me, college, his
childhood, nothing.

25:22.937 --> 25:25.387
It's as if his memory's
been wiped clean.

25:25.389 --> 25:27.389
I'm not sure

25:27.391 --> 25:28.857
he's ever gonna remember us.

25:28.859 --> 25:30.342
I don't believe that.

25:30.344 --> 25:32.711
What are you doing?

25:32.713 --> 25:35.113
You said Vincent said
he was late for something.

25:35.115 --> 25:36.949
Maybe it has to do
with that guy that got away.

25:41.454 --> 25:43.672
There. Forward
that to Gabe.

25:43.674 --> 25:46.591
Have him run an I.D. check through
every database he can access.

25:46.593 --> 25:48.427
Maybe if we can find
who Vincent was after,

25:48.429 --> 25:50.078
we can find Vincent.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.130
Keep me posted.

25:52.132 --> 25:53.632
Wait, where
are you going?

25:53.634 --> 25:56.435
Do a little surveillance.

26:05.194 --> 26:06.761
Damn it.

26:06.763 --> 26:08.814
Hey, so we don't screw up
any more cases,

26:08.816 --> 26:10.232
can you take
a look at this?

26:10.234 --> 26:12.100
Don't you ever knock?

26:12.102 --> 26:14.036
Sorry, old habit.
I keep forgetting

26:14.038 --> 26:16.271
Joe's gone and you're in charge
now. For some reason,

26:16.273 --> 26:19.574
my brain just, like,
can't process that. Go figure.

26:21.777 --> 26:23.879
You recognize this guy?

26:23.881 --> 26:26.798
No, never seen him before.
That's the problem.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.501
He doesn't exist anywhere
on any database.

26:29.503 --> 26:31.169
How does someone stay off
the grid in this day and age?

26:31.171 --> 26:33.288
I don't know. Friends
in high places, maybe?

26:33.290 --> 26:34.723
Is this a case
we're working on?

26:34.725 --> 26:36.591
No, it's a case
Catherine's working on.

26:36.593 --> 26:37.626
And she asked you to help?

26:37.628 --> 26:38.793
What, did she lose her mind?

26:38.795 --> 26:40.062
No, she lost Vincent.

26:40.064 --> 26:41.480
And the last time
she saw him,

26:41.482 --> 26:43.015
he was after
whoever this guy is,

26:43.017 --> 26:44.466
which is what I'm trying
to figure out.

26:44.468 --> 26:46.234
Whatever. Let me know

26:46.236 --> 26:47.436
if I have enough
for an arrest, okay?

26:47.438 --> 26:48.687
I'm going home.

26:48.689 --> 26:50.238
So that's it?
You don't care?

26:50.240 --> 26:53.308
About Cat? Always.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.743
About Vincent,
um...

26:54.745 --> 26:56.161
I don't know.

26:56.163 --> 26:57.746
I mean, personally, I like him--

26:57.748 --> 26:59.614
at least I used to--
but I'm just really tired

26:59.616 --> 27:01.649
of watching him ruin her life.
Enough already.

27:01.651 --> 27:03.118
Do you care that we might
be able to save him,

27:03.120 --> 27:04.669
like Catherine saved me?

27:04.671 --> 27:07.506
I'm sorry, when you say "we,"
do you mean we humans

27:07.508 --> 27:08.957
or we beasts?

27:08.959 --> 27:10.475
And by "we," I mean you.

27:10.477 --> 27:12.427
Tess, I am not a beast anymore.

27:12.429 --> 27:14.129
If I was, don't
you think Muirfield

27:14.131 --> 27:16.331
would still be after me, too?
I don't know,

27:16.333 --> 27:18.261
okay? All that crap just
gives me a headache anyway,

27:18.262 --> 27:19.612
and I wish I never
even knew about it.

27:19.613 --> 27:21.921
But you do, which means you were
meant to know about it,

27:21.922 --> 27:24.473
which means you
were meant to help.

27:24.475 --> 27:26.458
Whether you're tired of it
or not.

27:30.113 --> 27:32.280
What is it?

27:32.282 --> 27:33.782
It's a match.

27:33.784 --> 27:35.317
Popped up on
the SEC database

27:35.319 --> 27:37.753
of all places.
Whoever was

27:37.755 --> 27:40.288
covering his tracks must
have forgot to look there.

27:41.124 --> 27:42.841
Li Zhao?

27:42.843 --> 27:44.242
Li Zhao, who's that?

27:44.244 --> 27:45.911
He's the geneticist
I tried to find

27:45.913 --> 27:47.796
when I first started
looking for a cure,

27:47.798 --> 27:51.333
until I realized he's the one
who created Muirfield.

27:51.335 --> 27:55.554
Vincent's going after the man
who turned him into a beast.

28:18.995 --> 28:20.162
Condor.

28:20.164 --> 28:21.196
What happened?

28:21.198 --> 28:23.582
Sir, I don't know.

28:23.584 --> 28:26.118
I let Zhao think
that he had caught me.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.335
And I had him,

28:27.337 --> 28:29.371
but...

28:29.373 --> 28:31.706
Sir, who is Catherine Chandler?

28:31.708 --> 28:34.176
Nobody you need to worry about.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.962
Yeah, but she seemed to know me

28:36.964 --> 28:40.382
and... I believed her.

28:40.384 --> 28:41.850
So? You're trying to tell me
you're surprised

28:41.852 --> 28:43.218
that you had a life before this?

28:43.220 --> 28:44.886
Did that never occur to you?

28:44.888 --> 28:47.055
Of course not, sir, but when...

28:47.057 --> 28:48.807
Then forget about it.

28:48.809 --> 28:51.860
You can't let it distract you,
do you understand?

28:51.862 --> 28:54.079
You've got a job to do, soldier.

28:54.081 --> 28:57.149
This is why you were chosen,
what you were trained for.

28:57.151 --> 28:58.984
That is all you need
to remember.

28:58.986 --> 29:01.786
Now get back on Zhao's trail
before he disappears again

29:01.788 --> 29:04.789
and eliminate him this time,
understood?

29:04.791 --> 29:06.541
Understood, sir.

29:30.784 --> 29:32.452
<i>Stop him!</i>

30:00.331 --> 30:01.781
Gamble paid off.

30:01.783 --> 30:03.166
He came back.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.951
Nothing wrong
with his short-term memory.

30:04.953 --> 30:05.918
What's he doing?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.337
He's on the move.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.871
If Gabe's right,
he's following Zhao,

30:08.873 --> 30:10.489
although I have no idea how.

30:10.491 --> 30:12.508
I wouldn't try to stop him
if I were you.

30:12.510 --> 30:13.826
I'm not.

30:13.828 --> 30:15.044
If he's after Muirfield,

30:15.046 --> 30:16.429
I want to be there
when he finds him.

30:16.431 --> 30:18.715
We talking revenge?

30:18.717 --> 30:21.768
No, justice.
I'll call you back.

30:40.454 --> 30:42.121
Okay, JT, I give up.

30:42.123 --> 30:45.792
I have no idea
how Vincent is tracking Zhao.

30:45.794 --> 30:48.328
I might know.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.029
According to the blood sample

30:50.031 --> 30:53.166
from the tranq dart, it looks
like it might be all part

30:53.168 --> 30:54.884
of the new Vincent.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.535
I'm listening.
There's been a small

30:56.537 --> 30:58.304
but significant change
in his DNA.

30:58.306 --> 31:00.873
Simply put,
Vincent can now slow down

31:00.875 --> 31:03.326
and redirect the hemoglobin
in his blood

31:03.328 --> 31:05.428
to heighten specific senses.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.713
Okay, I'm not following.
Look, when you and I

31:07.715 --> 31:10.400
walk down a street,
our senses can only tell us

31:10.402 --> 31:11.484
what's happening at that moment,

31:11.486 --> 31:14.654
right? But an apex predator...

31:18.442 --> 31:19.992
...he can use his senses
to track down

31:19.994 --> 31:23.363
<i>another animal that</i>
<i>passed by that same spot...</i>

31:24.564 --> 31:26.783
...hours or even days before.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.000
JT, there are eight million

31:28.002 --> 31:29.118
people in this city--

31:29.120 --> 31:31.087
How could Vince possibly
track...

31:31.089 --> 31:32.622
Do you know that grizzlies
have been known

31:32.624 --> 31:34.674
to track their prey
over 20 miles across the wild?

31:34.676 --> 31:36.342
Yeah, a grizzly,
maybe, but not a...

31:36.344 --> 31:38.211
A beast?

31:40.131 --> 31:41.764
Whoa!

32:54.288 --> 32:56.088
Who did this to you?!

32:57.007 --> 32:58.791
Who are you working for?

33:32.409 --> 33:34.527
Vincent!

34:04.691 --> 34:05.992
Vincent!

34:13.951 --> 34:15.501
Who sent you?

34:15.503 --> 34:17.335
Vincent, where are you?

34:23.578 --> 34:25.911
Vincent...

35:03.467 --> 35:05.217
What?

35:05.219 --> 35:07.753
This is how we met.

35:07.755 --> 35:10.006
You saving me.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.009
Whether you remember
it or not,

35:13.011 --> 35:15.728
we're meant to be.

35:19.002 --> 35:21.775
Our preliminary investigation
indicates that the explosion

35:21.776 --> 35:24.243
was not related to any
form of terrorism.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.685
That said, however,
the investigation is ongoing.

35:30.731 --> 35:32.380
Bad news.

35:32.382 --> 35:35.550
None of the bodies
at the scene matched Zhao's DNA.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.235
Got away again.

35:39.188 --> 35:40.722
Damn it.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.190
At least Muirfield's destroyed.

35:42.192 --> 35:43.992
Yeah, but with Zhao
still on the loose,

35:43.994 --> 35:45.610
it won't be long before he finds
a way to start another

35:45.612 --> 35:47.532
Muirfield, and we're
right back where we started.

35:48.197 --> 35:51.199
So what do we do?

35:51.201 --> 35:54.119
Bank on Vincent
to follow orders.

35:54.121 --> 35:57.739
Hope my daughter
doesn't get in the way again.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.728
Here, sit down.

36:21.230 --> 36:23.231
No, I'm fine, really.

36:23.233 --> 36:24.599
Sit.

36:37.063 --> 36:39.798
Too bad you can't heal
yourself anymore.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.000
That's different, too.

36:52.695 --> 36:55.930
Look, I just want
to say I'm sorry.

36:55.932 --> 36:58.333
For what?

36:58.335 --> 37:00.735
For not remembering
any of this,

37:00.737 --> 37:01.936
not...

37:01.938 --> 37:04.339
not remembering you.

37:05.191 --> 37:07.242
It's okay, you will.

37:07.244 --> 37:09.277
Bright side,
in the meantime,

37:09.279 --> 37:12.580
we get to fall in love
with each other all over again.

37:12.582 --> 37:15.717
What makes you
so sure we will?

37:15.719 --> 37:17.919
'Cause we don't
have a choice.

37:17.921 --> 37:20.672
I told you, we're meant to be.

37:21.924 --> 37:24.192
You really believe that,
don't you?

37:24.194 --> 37:26.628
I do.

37:26.630 --> 37:29.314
And I know you do, too.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.833
You just...

37:31.835 --> 37:34.168
don't remember it yet.

37:35.471 --> 37:38.473
But you do believe
me, don't you?

37:38.475 --> 37:40.558
About us?

37:43.279 --> 37:45.030
Yes.

37:46.315 --> 37:48.516
But... I...

37:48.518 --> 37:51.102
But what?

37:51.104 --> 37:53.354
Vincent, what aren't
you telling me?

37:53.356 --> 37:55.940
You can trust me;
we can trust each other.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.358
We always have.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.245
Did Zhao do
this to you?

38:00.247 --> 38:01.663
Was this just
about revenge...

38:01.665 --> 38:02.797
Let it go.
No.

38:02.799 --> 38:04.365
Please, don't.

38:04.367 --> 38:06.384
I just...

38:08.254 --> 38:11.589
I just want
to help you.

38:11.591 --> 38:14.159
I... hate that they
did this to you.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.745
I... I hate that
they keep hurting you

38:16.747 --> 38:19.264
and I don't understand why.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.851
Why can't they...

38:22.853 --> 38:27.021
why can't they just
leave you alone?

38:31.327 --> 38:33.445
I don't know.

38:33.447 --> 38:34.896
But I can't

38:34.898 --> 38:38.900
answer any more questions--
do you understand?

38:41.504 --> 38:43.855
Yes.

38:43.857 --> 38:45.824
Yes, all right.

38:45.826 --> 38:48.460
I'm sorry.
It's just...

38:54.216 --> 38:57.769
It's been a long three months.

38:59.054 --> 39:01.606
All that matters
is that you're back,

39:01.608 --> 39:04.559
and that Muirfield's gone,
and they can't...

39:04.561 --> 39:07.278
hurt anyone else
like they hurt us.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.980
Zhao got away.
I know.

39:08.982 --> 39:12.484
I know, and we will
find him, I promise.

39:14.153 --> 39:16.321
But not tonight.

39:18.073 --> 39:20.542
Tonight...

39:20.544 --> 39:24.111
please don't go.

you love you me ♪

40:20.853 --> 40:22.437

40:22.439 --> 40:25.807
I've lost... so much.

40:27.644 --> 40:30.511
I can't lose you
again, too.

40:48.698 --> 40:49.964
Hello?

40:49.966 --> 40:52.366
Cat, it's Tess.
Where's Vincent?

40:52.368 --> 40:53.868
Tess. What?

40:53.870 --> 40:57.405
Vincent.
Do you know where he is?

40:58.974 --> 41:01.559
I think you
better get down here.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.850
What happened?
I got to tell you, Cat,

41:08.852 --> 41:11.319
this is gonna be pretty
hard to keep under wraps.

41:11.321 --> 41:12.353
Why? Who's the victim?

41:12.355 --> 41:14.322
Li Zhao.
It gets worse.

41:14.324 --> 41:16.741
He wasn't just killed,
he was mauled to death,

41:16.743 --> 41:19.193
as if by a wild animal.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.785
Where's Vincent?
