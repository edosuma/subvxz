00:05.695 --> 00:07.290
Whoo!

00:09.000 --> 00:15.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:32.494 --> 00:33.947
Hey, beautiful!

00:34.533 --> 00:35.778
Are you talking to me?

00:35.898 --> 00:38.371
No, I'm talking to your friend,
uh, Jon Lovitz over here.

00:38.491 --> 00:40.661
Fuck, yes, I'm talking to you.
What's happening?

00:40.695 --> 00:41.388
Asshole.

00:41.508 --> 00:45.267
Oh, come on, don't call me an asshole.
They sell sunscreen to everybody.

00:45.301 --> 00:47.704
I got a question for
you. And that is...

00:47.739 --> 00:50.307
Why am I so damn hot in here?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.176
Yeah, what you know
about money, girl?

00:52.211 --> 00:54.479
What you know
about money, girl?

00:54.513 --> 00:56.615
We should go.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:56.649 --> 00:58.617
Okay, ladies, let me just
break it down for you, okay?

00:58.652 --> 01:00.453
Before you make yourselves
look any stupider.

01:00.488 --> 01:02.589
I'm a closing pitcher
for Texas, girl.

01:02.623 --> 01:05.726
And I close in more ways,
than just on the mound.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.362
Well, that's good news,
cause I don't date athletes.

01:08.397 --> 01:10.198
Oh, not yet you don't.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.434
Right? First time
for everything, huh?

01:16.407 --> 01:18.475
Go on. Go, go.

01:23.382 --> 01:26.618
Hey, hey, slow down.
Wait up. Look, hey, uh...

01:26.652 --> 01:29.955
I'm drunk, okay, and I'm, uh...

01:29.989 --> 01:33.359
I was, I was acting like a jerk, and
that's, that's not me. I mean...

01:33.393 --> 01:38.898
I mean, it is me, I'm a baseball player,
but I'm not a dumb jock, and I...

01:38.933 --> 01:41.267
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that stuff.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.504
I was rely nervous, and...

01:44.538 --> 01:46.606
It's because...

01:48.275 --> 01:49.375
I like you.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.616
Okay?

01:57.386 --> 02:00.389
Oh my God! Shit.

02:03.093 --> 02:05.128
Aw, aw...
Oh, shit, no, no.

02:05.162 --> 02:06.896
Somebody call an ambulance.

02:06.931 --> 02:11.602
What are we gonna do? We
got playoffs, B. Playoffs!

02:11.636 --> 02:14.505
I'm fine...

02:52.548 --> 02:56.418
Hey, you. It's kinda quiet without,
uh, little dude here. Huh?

02:56.452 --> 02:59.221
It's fucking awesome.
Finally shit's back to normal.

02:59.255 --> 03:02.123
I'm once again a single
thick-dick swinging bachelor,

03:02.158 --> 03:04.993
no dumb baggage to
fucking carry me down.

03:05.027 --> 03:08.964
Thank you, Christ, for allowing
all this awesome stuff to happen.

03:08.998 --> 03:10.599
Hey, Kenny, you know,
I was thinking...

03:10.633 --> 03:12.667
If you want, Maria and I
could do some redecorating.

03:12.669 --> 03:16.071
Maybe swap out some of these hot
babes for some new hot babes.

03:16.105 --> 03:20.442
That way when Toby comes back to visit,
he's got some new shit to get baby hard to.

03:20.476 --> 03:21.977
I wouldn't hold
your breath on that.

03:22.011 --> 03:23.445
The kid's gone.

03:23.479 --> 03:25.747
The sooner we accept
that, the better we'll be.

03:25.781 --> 03:27.682
As soon as we get this nursery
changed back into my dojo,

03:27.717 --> 03:29.484
I can get my shit
fucking ripped again.

03:29.518 --> 03:31.686
Okay, aye, aye, Captain.

03:32.755 --> 03:35.156
What the fuck is that?

03:35.190 --> 03:37.891
Fuck.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.760
Holy shit.
It's Spurgen, the hermit crab.

03:40.795 --> 03:42.729
He lives in a fucking bowl?

03:42.763 --> 03:45.697
He must be getting
high as fuck!

03:45.732 --> 03:48.166
Goddamnit. Now I gotta figure out
what to do with this dumb thing.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.503
If I were you, I would smash the
fuck out of that crab with a hammer.

03:52.537 --> 03:54.205
No.
No, no. We...

03:54.239 --> 03:55.506
This is Toby's favorite
pet. He probably misses him.

03:55.541 --> 03:57.742
Maria, feed this fucking crab.

03:57.776 --> 03:58.976
Okay.

04:00.546 --> 04:02.947
- Love you!
- Love you, too.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.649
Seems like you guys
are happy again.

04:04.683 --> 04:06.785
Mmm-hmm, this
is awesome!

04:07.386 --> 04:08.353
Awesome.

04:13.793 --> 04:17.563
Peek-a-boo. Just kidding.
Psyche your mind, it's me.

04:17.596 --> 04:19.699
You wanted to see me?

04:19.733 --> 04:21.601
What do
you want to do?

04:21.635 --> 04:24.972
Offer your franchise star player
a blowjob, slash, hand job...

04:25.006 --> 04:27.174
For saving your stinky ass.

04:27.209 --> 04:28.609
Star player...

04:28.644 --> 04:31.679
That's exactly what I
wanted talk to you about.

04:31.713 --> 04:36.751
You are no longer
the star player of the Mermen.

04:36.785 --> 04:38.585
Come on, man. What the fuck
are you talking about, dude?

04:38.620 --> 04:40.787
After I just saved your
asses at the game...

04:40.822 --> 04:42.589
You don't even play
for the team anymore.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.357
What the fuck are
you talking about?

04:45.460 --> 04:47.327
Because you're
playing for Texas.

04:49.864 --> 04:51.731
What?

04:51.765 --> 04:53.266
You're getting
called up, Kenny.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.970
You gotta be shitting me.

05:01.574 --> 05:03.475
I mean, finally, motherfuckers.

05:03.509 --> 05:05.443
I knew this was gonna happen.

05:05.477 --> 05:07.178
I just can't believe it took these
dudes this long to figure it out.

05:07.212 --> 05:08.646
Jesus Christ.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.281
Their closer got
hit by a truck.

05:11.316 --> 05:15.519
Now that Ivan fucking sucks,
I'm the logical choice. Ha.

05:15.554 --> 05:21.092
I've been wanting to kick your old, worthless
ass off my team for such a long time.

05:21.126 --> 05:24.496
Well, I look forward to never seeing
your wrinkly fucking face again, either.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.398
Fuck you, you
fat, fucking honky.

05:26.432 --> 05:29.768
And fuck you too,
you black dick licker.

05:31.638 --> 05:32.805
You shit's licker!

05:32.839 --> 05:34.506
Fuck you!

05:34.541 --> 05:36.375
Oh, fuck you and your Mama too!

05:36.409 --> 05:37.610
I hope you get AIDS.

05:37.644 --> 05:40.213
Bye, bye, motherfucker!

05:40.247 --> 05:43.216
These vessels follow the same
course as your harmonious arteries.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.118
But they return the blood
into two different systems...

05:45.153 --> 05:47.120
Everybody be cool, this
isn't a school shooting!

05:47.155 --> 05:49.090
It's something
far more fantastic.

05:49.124 --> 05:50.591
Sir?
Sir, yourself.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.359
Where's Andrea?

05:52.393 --> 05:55.195
You can't keep storming into my classrooms.
We're broken up.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.299
What? No, no, no, no.
That breakup wasn't real.

05:59.333 --> 06:03.536
Sure, You betrayed me and my party,
but that breakup was spoken in anger.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.505
And, I'm sorry for
that. It didn't count.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.106
It didn't?

06:07.140 --> 06:09.675
No, this is the
breakup that counts.

06:11.145 --> 06:12.445
You're an asshole.

06:12.479 --> 06:14.680
Easy, let's not
get bitter, okay?

06:14.714 --> 06:16.982
I know a lot of you guys
are looking at me and saying,

06:17.017 --> 06:20.952
"Hey, there's a dude who
is exactly my same age."

06:20.986 --> 06:24.588
Well, truth be told. I'm
a grown-up, real person.

06:24.622 --> 06:28.125
Sure your bodies might be tight.
You might like to have sex in amazing,

06:28.159 --> 06:31.061
cool, intricate positions.
But besides that shit...

06:31.095 --> 06:33.296
all don't have a fucking clue.

06:33.331 --> 06:37.935
The shit y'all are doing. The fucking Facebook
shit, the Internets, the fucking DVDS.

06:37.969 --> 06:41.272
That's all bullshit.
Your shit isn't real.

06:41.306 --> 06:47.078
But from where I'm standing, a full
grown man, who has achieved his dreams.

06:47.113 --> 06:50.215
Yeah, that's right. I'm
going back to the majors.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.684
My shit is about
as real as it gets.

06:52.719 --> 06:56.154
And besides, I can
out-party, out-drink,

06:56.188 --> 06:58.990
and out-fuck,
each of you.

06:59.024 --> 07:02.527
Youth can suck my dick.

07:02.561 --> 07:08.433
So unless you have anything to add.
Then consider this relationship over.

07:08.467 --> 07:12.269
Have a nice life.
I'll never forget you.

07:12.304 --> 07:14.905
And I know you won't forget me.

07:14.940 --> 07:19.510
Cause I popped that cherry.
That's right, I tore it out for all you young guys.

07:43.536 --> 07:46.038
Saying good-bye to
you, is gonna hurt.

07:46.072 --> 07:49.107
I ripped up a lot of fucking awesome
waves on this boogie board.

07:49.142 --> 07:51.576
Basically owned
this goddamn beach.

07:51.611 --> 07:53.412
Adios, friend.

07:54.947 --> 07:56.615
We had a good time
here in Myrtle.

07:56.649 --> 08:00.986
But, now it is time to say
goodbye to your glorious shores.

08:01.021 --> 08:03.389
So crazy that this is the end.

08:03.423 --> 08:06.892
It's not a bad thing, though, Stevie.
Don't be all sad and fucking melancholy. It's...

08:06.926 --> 08:08.961
Maria, you must be pretty
happy though, huh?

08:08.995 --> 08:12.030
Texas has a fucking weather
climate very similar to Mexico...

08:12.065 --> 08:14.132
Except it doesn't stink like
fucking buttholes and donkeys.

08:18.203 --> 08:21.305
Hey, don't think I just didn't catch that
fucking non-verbal loaded exchange, there.

08:22.741 --> 08:24.574
Permission to speak
freely, Kenny?

08:25.510 --> 08:26.910
Permission granted.

08:26.944 --> 08:28.611
You know how you
always say we're like...

08:28.646 --> 08:32.715
Astronauts, or lead guitarists,
and we're not cut out for family.

08:32.749 --> 08:35.484
I said that about
myself, but continue.

08:35.519 --> 08:39.054
Okay, well. I'm just
starting to think like...

08:39.089 --> 08:44.627
Maybe I am one of those pussies
that does like family.

08:44.661 --> 08:46.195
What the hell are
you saying, Stevie?

08:47.698 --> 08:52.502
Kenny, Maria is pregnant.

08:52.536 --> 08:55.539
How can you tell, man?
I mean, she always looks like she's pregnant.

08:55.573 --> 09:01.345
She pissed on one of those sticks.
I held it under her pussy myself. It's legit, man.

09:01.379 --> 09:04.415
Well, what the fuck, dude? We're gonna have
to go and investigate some options, now.

09:04.449 --> 09:06.484
Maybe an abortion clinic, dude.

09:06.519 --> 09:09.187
The last thing we need in Texas, is
another goddamn baby dragging us down.

09:09.222 --> 09:11.923
Did you not learn anything
from our time from Toby?

09:11.957 --> 09:14.758
Kenny. That's what I wanted
to talk to you about...

09:16.728 --> 09:19.129
We're not going
to Texas with you.

09:19.163 --> 09:24.433
We're going to stay here and we're gonna
build a life together, in Myrtle.

09:29.072 --> 09:30.705
Stevie, have you
thought this through?

09:30.739 --> 09:32.273
I mean, you're really
willing to forgo...

09:32.308 --> 09:34.776
All the status that'll come
with being my associate?

09:34.810 --> 09:36.645
Give up your possible
fucking co-starring role,

09:36.679 --> 09:39.247
in the reality series
I'm developing? Huh?

09:43.153 --> 09:44.653
Yes.

09:44.687 --> 09:47.589
What? You're, you're
thinking about it?

09:47.624 --> 09:50.592
I've thought about it.
Kenny, we're staying in Myrtle.

09:55.999 --> 10:00.535
Well, I suppose if you're gonna
do that, you're gonna need this.

10:05.107 --> 10:06.607
What is this?

10:07.976 --> 10:10.177
It's the keys to
the Panty Dropper.

10:10.212 --> 10:12.413
If you're gonna stay in
Myrtle, and become a man,

10:12.447 --> 10:15.817
then you're sure as hell, gonna need
a man's water recreational vehicle.

10:15.851 --> 10:17.519
I don't know
what to say.

10:17.553 --> 10:21.690
I do. Steven
Bernard Janowski.

10:21.725 --> 10:24.494
You are hereby relieved of
your duties as my assistant.

10:24.528 --> 10:28.031
You have served
me well, hombre.

10:28.066 --> 10:31.902
And I give you the right to name your
child after me. Regardless of gender.

10:33.205 --> 10:34.605
Gracias.
For real?

10:34.640 --> 10:36.240
For reals, dog.

10:36.275 --> 10:39.811
Come here, you two.
Come here. Come here.

10:50.456 --> 10:52.224
It's a special moment, guys.

11:12.347 --> 11:16.082
Kenny. I wasn't expecting
to see you again.

11:16.117 --> 11:19.619
Yeah, well, surprise, surprise.
How's it feel to have your mind blown?

11:21.655 --> 11:24.990
I'm moving to Texas. Got
called up to the Majors, so...

11:25.024 --> 11:28.159
Gonna go live a life of being
much richer and famouser.

11:28.194 --> 11:30.294
So you really got called up?

11:30.329 --> 11:34.299
Yup. I put in the hard work,
and did all the shit, and...

11:34.333 --> 11:37.502
I beat this Russian.
And I earned my spot.

11:37.536 --> 11:39.537
Congratulations.

11:39.572 --> 11:41.540
I just stopped by
actually because...

11:41.574 --> 11:44.310
I found something that I think
Toby's probably gonna want.

11:47.114 --> 11:49.349
A marijuana pipe?

11:49.383 --> 11:51.651
Well, technically I use
this pipe to smoke DMT.

11:51.686 --> 11:54.654
But, now it's the
home to Spurgen.

11:55.789 --> 11:58.290
His hermit crab.
It's a pet.

11:58.325 --> 12:01.760
Is it cool if I enter your domicile
to return to him his property?

12:01.794 --> 12:03.328
Come on in.

12:05.348 --> 12:07.297
Hey... What's up,
you little jerk?

12:08.500 --> 12:09.903
l got something for ya.

12:10.023 --> 12:14.372
It's Spurgen. It's your pet
hermit crab. You remember him?

12:16.442 --> 12:19.946
Also wanted to have a man-to-man
talk with you, if that was cool.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.783
Due to some recent events...

12:23.818 --> 12:27.087
I don't think I'm going to be
able to be around you, as...

12:27.122 --> 12:30.658
As much as I have been
in the past few weeks.

12:30.693 --> 12:33.561
I've got an incredible
job opportunity.

12:33.596 --> 12:38.866
That is going to force me to relocate
to a much dryer, more arid climate.

12:40.568 --> 12:44.470
But I hope that you know
that, while I'm gone...

12:44.505 --> 12:50.176
All the wealth that I will acquire.
All the fame, and fortunes...

12:50.210 --> 12:52.578
And all the women
that I will bed.

12:52.612 --> 12:56.749
I will be doing all that stuff,
so that you'll be proud of me.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.287
So that you can be
proud of your dad.

13:02.723 --> 13:04.190
Kenny...

13:06.560 --> 13:10.130
Just wanna thank
you for coming by.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.500
When you left me...

13:13.535 --> 13:18.340
When we were gonna go
to Tampa. It hurt a lot.

13:20.143 --> 13:23.613
And I know when I left
you, it hurt you too.

13:24.748 --> 13:26.683
And I just wanna
say, I'm sorry.

13:28.553 --> 13:31.221
I didn't just come
back for Toby.

13:33.391 --> 13:39.162
I mean, I did, but I also
came back for you, too.

13:45.334 --> 13:48.837
Well, your timing kinda sucks.
I'm getting ready to move to Texas and shit.

13:49.839 --> 13:51.239
Right.

13:52.508 --> 13:55.844
Not gonna really...
Not gonna be around.

14:00.784 --> 14:02.318
I'm gonna go.

14:03.721 --> 14:05.321
See ya, Toby.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.194
Adios, April.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.185
How you doing, Kenny?

15:09.219 --> 15:11.020
Yeah, I'm doing good.

15:11.054 --> 15:12.989
Well, there's no
time for a pep talk.

15:13.023 --> 15:17.628
But, I would like to take a knee
here with you and, say a prayer.

15:17.662 --> 15:19.596
Will you pray with me?

15:19.631 --> 15:21.632
To, to Jesus?
Yes, sir.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.702
Okay, yeah.

15:24.736 --> 15:28.840
Dear Jesus, we come
to you with gratitude...

15:28.875 --> 15:32.678
On this evening, with thanks
for shepherding this man,

15:32.712 --> 15:35.514
Kenny Powers, to a
personal victory.

15:35.548 --> 15:37.916
The fact that we sit here, now,
with you Lord, in this clubhouse.

15:39.319 --> 15:44.389
Is proof that Kenneth
Powers has successfully...

15:44.423 --> 15:46.824
Sucked his dream's dick, Lord.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.225
Thank you, Jesus.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.160
Thank you, Jesus, for that.

15:50.195 --> 15:53.130
Kenny sucked, and he stroked.

15:53.164 --> 15:55.767
Kenny learned how to breathe
through his nose while doin' it.

15:55.801 --> 15:59.704
Kenny found a free finger
to touch ass along the way.

15:59.739 --> 16:01.673
And that took commitment, Lord.

16:01.708 --> 16:07.047
But, you, and I, and Kenneth know
that there is much more to come.

16:07.081 --> 16:08.482
The finish
line, Jesus.

16:08.549 --> 16:10.317
Hallelujah!

16:10.351 --> 16:13.487
Give him strength of fist
to stay among the stroke.

16:13.521 --> 16:18.125
That you relax his throat, to, to
embrace this bulging opportunity.

16:18.159 --> 16:19.293
Give me strength,
fucking Jesus.

16:19.327 --> 16:21.595
Give him his strength,
Lord Jesus.

16:21.629 --> 16:23.430
Endless strength,
fucking Jesus.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.465
He's gonna bring the
fortified ejaculation.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.501
Mmm!

16:27.535 --> 16:31.304
Tonight, for the first time, in his own
public demonstration in front of you!

16:31.338 --> 16:33.373
And the world, Jesus.

16:33.408 --> 16:35.242
Super chill, Jesus Christ.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.611
It's cum time.

16:39.348 --> 16:41.850
And it's up to you, Kenny.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.286
Spit

16:45.755 --> 16:46.956
or swallow?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.827
You know the answer...

16:54.465 --> 16:56.600
Thank you,
Jesus. Amen.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.335
Fuck yeah,
Jesus. Amen.

17:01.372 --> 17:02.572
Take it down.

17:35.036 --> 17:37.338
Kenny! Kenny!

17:37.372 --> 17:40.241
All right, baby, one's the fucking
fastball, two's the curve ball.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.343
You got it. Let's
do it. Let's go.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.197
Strike!

19:06.363 --> 19:09.097
That was the moment
I realized I had finally achieved...

19:09.132 --> 19:12.033
Everything I worked
so hard for.

19:12.068 --> 19:16.405
Despite the countless obstacles and
adversities I faced along the way.

19:16.439 --> 19:19.474
It was that exact moment, when I
looked into that batter's eyes...

19:19.509 --> 19:22.979
And I saw stone cold,
child-like fear.

19:23.013 --> 19:28.017
For the first time in so many moons,
I felt I was in total control.

19:28.051 --> 19:32.555
I held my own destiny in my hands,
as sure as I held that baseball.

19:32.590 --> 19:37.694
My future, everything, comes
down to one final pitch.

20:10.064 --> 20:12.365
What the fuck? What
the fuck, Kenny?

20:20.006 --> 20:21.807
Where the fuck are you going?

20:21.841 --> 20:23.308
Home, motherfucker.

20:27.012 --> 20:28.680
I'm in a fucking
Cameron Crowe movie!

20:28.714 --> 20:30.648
Whoo!

20:32.751 --> 20:36.754
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

20:36.788 --> 20:39.357
Whoo! Fuck me!

20:48.668 --> 20:50.635
Whoo, they gonna be pissed.

22:06.914 --> 22:11.919
One of baseball's greats, Kenny Powers,
has perished in a horrific car accident.

22:11.953 --> 22:14.921
A pitching phenomenon
and a controversial figure...

22:14.956 --> 22:17.091
The moments
directly following a comeback,

22:17.125 --> 22:19.293
are hands fucking down
the sweetest part.

22:22.164 --> 22:26.767
When everybody you've ever known, the whole
world in fact, celebrates your success.

22:31.807 --> 22:34.308
Everyone gets some.

22:34.342 --> 22:37.611
The little people who acted as stepping
stones on your path to success...

22:41.016 --> 22:43.517
They can brag to their children
about how they aided you.

22:48.023 --> 22:51.592
Even if it was only in some
stupid, insignificant way.

22:58.133 --> 23:00.301
Even the enemies you've
made along the way...

23:03.271 --> 23:05.506
They have to begrudge the fact that
you've shoved their jealousness,

23:05.541 --> 23:07.275
lack of faith, and spite...

23:09.011 --> 23:11.345
Right back in their
fucking hater faces.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.627
But I imagine it's probably sweetest
for those that truly believed in you.

23:30.432 --> 23:33.200
Those that stood by you
through the good times...

23:37.739 --> 23:39.539
And the not so good times.

23:49.381 --> 23:51.983
Standing by a champion
is a feat unto itself.

23:52.017 --> 23:54.385
I mean, it's not as much work
as actually doing the comeback,

23:56.254 --> 23:58.288
but it still should
count for something.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.603
I hope this inspirational novel story
helps to give you inspiration,

24:13.638 --> 24:15.973
in your attempts to stop being
a regular, normal person.

24:16.007 --> 24:18.676
And to start being
a champion instead.

24:18.710 --> 24:21.246
Dreams and riches do come
true for some people.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.684
Take it from me,
Kenny Powers. I'm out.

24:25.719 --> 24:28.354
The end...of the book.

24:38.364 --> 24:41.867
I cannot find my phone.
I think I left in my purse.

24:56.681 --> 24:58.348
Big Cannons.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.856
What in the fuck?

25:08.192 --> 25:09.559
I'm alive.

25:11.629 --> 25:16.065
I... I can
see that.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.468
The news said...
I know what the news said.

25:18.502 --> 25:20.269
I'm sorry.

25:20.304 --> 25:23.172
I would've been here sooner, but
I had to get my truck back.

25:23.206 --> 25:27.208
Kenny, what is going on?
Your hair is bleached.

25:27.243 --> 25:30.011
I know, it's to conceal
me. Now, just calm down.

25:30.045 --> 25:32.146
Hear what I have to say.

25:32.181 --> 25:34.482
When I came back from Mexico
I made you a promise...

25:34.517 --> 25:38.086
That I would do whatever it
takes, to make this thing work.

25:38.121 --> 25:40.988
And I failed you
on that promise.

25:41.023 --> 25:46.195
I was hypnotized by my vast
fame and my immense power.

25:46.229 --> 25:49.432
My incredible ego had
gotten the better of me.

25:49.466 --> 25:53.103
I used to think that the only
way to live was by winning...

25:53.137 --> 25:57.574
And now I realize that,
sometimes, losing is cool too.

25:57.609 --> 25:59.276
How do you mean?

25:59.310 --> 26:00.978
Well, like, having a family.

26:01.012 --> 26:03.080
I mean, not that having
a family is losing.

26:03.114 --> 26:07.218
I mean, it's winning, kind
of, but you know what...

26:07.252 --> 26:11.089
The bottom line, I want to
be there for you, April.

26:11.123 --> 26:15.494
I want to be there for Toby.
I want to be there for our fucking family.

26:16.996 --> 26:20.165
Kenny, everybody
thinks you're dead.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.269
I know. This was
the only way.

26:23.304 --> 26:25.605
The press would have
never left us alone.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.308
Really?

26:27.342 --> 26:29.710
Mmm-hmm.

26:29.744 --> 26:32.447
You couldn't have just stayed in the majors
and me and Toby could have come with you?

26:36.051 --> 26:39.553
Uh-uh. Just... No,
I don't think that...

26:39.588 --> 26:41.655
I don't think that
would've worked.

26:41.689 --> 26:44.958
I'm pretty sure this is the
right choice for our family.

26:53.466 --> 26:55.901
Come inside, you
son of a bitch.
