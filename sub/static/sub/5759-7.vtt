WEBVTT

00:00.460 --> 00:01.358
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.370 --> 00:03.462
Woman:
THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.262
IT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO READ BEFORE

00:04.300 --> 00:06.165
YOUR MEETING
WITH BRENDA MCGOWAN.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.337
LEE'S GOING TO HELP YOU
WITH COLLEGE.

00:07.370 --> 00:08.792
HEY, WHAT'S THIS SONG?
( music playing )

00:08.840 --> 00:11.502
IT'S NOT A SONG THAT TIPPY'S
SINGING, IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.507
WHERE IS THIS AREA CODE,
ANYWAYS?

00:12.540 --> 00:14.076
YORK COUNTY.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.099
DID ALI KNOW ANYBODY
FROM THERE?

00:15.140 --> 00:17.142
THERE WAS A COLLEGE THERE,
I JUST SAW IT.
CICERO.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.169
YEAH, LOOK.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.671
I GAVE THE R.V. TO "A"
FOR NOTHING.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.278
I THINK "A" GAVE YOU
SOMETHING REAL.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.685
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
DR. PALMER.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.779
WILL YOU TELL HER
TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT GIRL?

00:26.820 --> 00:28.412
WHAT GIRL?
THAT BLONDE GIRL.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.587
ARE YOU BRENDAN?
YEAH. IF YOU WANT,

00:30.630 --> 00:32.154
I COULD GO THROUGH SOME
OF THESE SCHOOLS WITH YOU.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.657
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU
WERE THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO WOULD LEAD SOMEBODY ON

00:34.700 --> 00:37.123
JUST TO GET WHAT
YOU WANTED.
YOU'VE NEVER
HAD TO BE CHARMING

00:37.170 --> 00:39.832
'CAUSE MOMMY AND DADDY HAVE
A SAFETY NET OF CASH
TO CATCH YOUR FALL.

00:39.870 --> 00:42.134
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO MOM
TO MAKE HER CHANGE HER
MIND ABOUT EUROPE?

00:42.170 --> 00:43.398
THE ONLY REASON YOU
WANT HER TO GO SO BAD

00:43.440 --> 00:46.102
IS SO YOU COULD START
BOFFING YOUR TEACHER AGAIN.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.734
THAT WAS MRS. GRUNWALTZ,
OUR FORMER HOUSE MOTHER.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.906
LEGEND HAS IT
SHE WAS FIRED.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.078
APPARENTLY YOU COULDN'T
GET ANYTHING PAST THAT BITCH.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.678
Man: DETECTIVE WILDEN,
HE'S DEAD.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.347
HANNA'S WORRIED THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
TO PIN IT ON HER MOM.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.140
THEY ARE BOTH GOING
TO NEED HELP.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.181
I KEEP A GUN LOCKED
IN MY DESK.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.414
IT'S MISSING.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.087
IT'S THE GUN.
AT LEAST I THINK IT IS.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.427
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT?
THEY FOUND IT

01:03.460 --> 01:05.189
IN MY MOM'S CLOSET.
I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.720
Man:
HOLD IT! DON'T MOVE.

01:18.470 --> 01:21.837
YOU WON'T SAY WHY
YOU HAD THE GUN.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.768
OR WHERE YOU
GOT THE GUN.

01:23.810 --> 01:27.416
OR WHY IT APPEARED YOU
WERE BURYING THE GUN
ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.886
YOU WANT SOME?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.456
HAN NA,

01:32.490 --> 01:36.586
YOU DON'T NEED A LAWYER
TO TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT
YOU'D LIKE A CUP COFFEE.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.121
NO, THANK YOU.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.090
HOW ABOUT I TELL
YOU WHAT I KNOW?

01:45.530 --> 01:48.090
YOU WERE CARRYING A CONCEALED
FIREARM WITHOUT A LICENSE.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.578
THE GUN IS
A .38 CALIBER REVOLVER.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.431
YOURS HOLDS SIX BULLETS,

01:55.480 --> 01:58.449
BUT YOU HAD ONLY FOUR.
STRAIGHTAWAY YOU
GOTTA WONDER WHERE

01:58.480 --> 02:00.175
THE OTHER BULLETS WENT,
RIGHT?

02:00.220 --> 02:02.882
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT
A THIRD-DEGREE FELONY CHARGE

02:02.920 --> 02:04.387
FOR CARRYING
A CONCEALED WEAPON.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.852
THAT'S UP TO
A SEVEN-YEAR SENTENCE.

02:08.890 --> 02:12.894
HANNA, I DO NOT WANT
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.228
NEITHER DO YOU.
NEITHER DO YOUR PARENTS.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.899
BUT I NEED YOU TO THINK ABOUT
WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT

02:17.930 --> 02:20.239
AND WHY.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW I WASN'T
JUST PROTECTING MYSELF?

02:22.540 --> 02:25.236
A HUNCH.
( knock on door)

02:25.270 --> 02:26.703
THAT'LL BE YOUR MOM.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.601
HANNA, WE'RE GOING.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.777
HER BAIL'S BEEN PAID
AND HER LAWYER'S ON THE WAY.

02:31.810 --> 02:34.142
COME ON.
I WILL WALK YOU OUT.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.484
THEY CALLED YOU?

02:42.530 --> 02:46.250
THEY'RE KEEPING THE GUN.
FOR TESTING.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.824
WHAT KIND OF TESTING?

02:50.430 --> 02:51.727
DAD.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.931
THE KIND THAT DETERMINES
WHETHER YOUR DAD'S GUN

02:53.970 --> 02:56.438
WAS USED TO KILL
A POLICE OFFICER.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.639
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.641
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT'S *

03:10.690 --> 03:12.885
* WHERE THIS ONE
YOU SAVE *

03:12.920 --> 03:14.888
* GOT A LOCKET,
IN YOUR POCKET *

03:14.920 --> 03:17.855
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

03:17.890 --> 03:20.597
* EVER SHOW YOU
THAT I KNOW YOU *

03:20.630 --> 03:22.723
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:22.770 --> 03:25.466
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET

03:25.500 --> 03:28.298
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

03:30.840 --> 03:31.909
WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
BE AT SCHOOL TODAY.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.931
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:33.980 --> 03:36.699
THERE'S NO SCHOOL UNTIL
THE D.A. CALLS.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.479
I COULD GET SEVEN YEARS--

03:38.510 --> 03:39.977
SEVEN YEARS?
FOR WHAT?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.976
Hanna:
CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON,

03:42.020 --> 03:44.739
ATI'EMPTING TO DESTROY EVIDENCE.

03:44.790 --> 03:47.588
MURDER. I DON'T KNOW,
WHATEVER THEY FIND.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.917
YOU'RE NOT A MURDERER.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.450
WELL, I'M RUINING
MY MOM'S LIFE,

03:50.490 --> 03:52.299
SO THAT'S GO'I'I'A COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.456
Emily:
HANNA, LISTEN TO ME.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.650
"A" PLANTED YOUR MOM'S CELL
PHONE IN WILDEN'S CASKET.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.395
"A" FISH ED THAT CAR
OUT OF THE LAKE.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.022
AND TWO DAYS AGO, "A" CALLED
THE COPS ON YOU.

03:59.070 --> 03:59.832
THIS IS A SET UP.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.735
GOD, WAS THAT
JUST TWO DAYS AGO?

04:01.770 --> 04:03.499
MAYBE THIS IS IT,
HANNA.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.861
I THINK YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR
PARENTS ABOUT "A".

04:05.910 --> 04:08.936
NO. EM, NONE OF THAT MA'I'I'ERS
IF MY MOM PULLED THE TRIGGER.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.345
Hanna: SHE'S THE ONE WHO LIED
ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS THE NIGHT

04:10.380 --> 04:14.043
WILDEN DIED, AND SHE'S THE ONE
WITH A GUN IN HER CLOSET.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.775
HEY, EMILY.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.811
EM? ARE YOU THERE?

04:17.850 --> 04:19.852
I NEED TO CALL YOU
RIGHT BACK, OKAY.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.988
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
AND WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT?

04:24.030 --> 04:27.397
I'M ON THE TEAM.
AS OF TODAY.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.419
YOU GO TO ROSEWOOD NOW?

04:28.460 --> 04:29.996
YEAH.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.965
SO, YOU JUST SWITCHED
SCHOOLS MID-SEMESTER? WHY?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.365
BE'ITER SWIM TEAM,

04:34.400 --> 04:35.936
BE'ITER CHANCE
OF A SCHOLARSHIP.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.359
PLUS, I DIDN'T
LIKE PRIVATE SCHOOL.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.935
I NEVER REALLY FIT IN.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.541
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR SHOULDER.
MUST SUCK TO BE OFF THE TEAM.

04:44.580 --> 04:45.842
I KNOW HOW MUCH
IT MEANT TO YOU.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.370
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.980
JENNA'S TOLD ME
A FEW THINGS.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.279
LOOKS FUN.
TOO LATE TO SIGN UP?

05:04.100 --> 05:07.035
( knock on door,
door opens )

05:10.010 --> 05:12.331
I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TOLD THE COPS.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.870
WORD FOR WORD.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.673
I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.701
I SAID NOTHING
ABOUT YOUR GUN,

05:17.750 --> 05:19.103
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.970
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.488
WHERE YOU FOUND IT,
AND WHY THE HELL YOU TOOK IT

05:23.520 --> 05:25.886
TO THAT COLLEGE.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.854
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT MOM.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.120
PROTECT MOM?
HANNA...

05:30.160 --> 05:32.082
IF YOU TOOK THAT GUN
FROM MY OFFICE--

05:32.130 --> 05:33.597
I DID NOT TAKE
THE GUN.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.321
I FOUND IT IN MOM'S
LUGGAGE FROM NEW YORK.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.005
( phone buzzing )

05:44.040 --> 05:46.634
SHUT THAT THING OFF,
AND COME DOWNSTAIRS.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.750
WHEN YOU CALLED ME BACK
FROM THAT SORORITY PARTY,

06:00.790 --> 06:02.018
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TELL ME THAT YOU'D FOUND

06:02.060 --> 06:03.584
THE PERSON ALI WAS
TALKING TO, NOT THAT--

06:03.630 --> 06:04.722
HANNA GOT ARRESTED.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.990
YEAH. NOT THAT.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.157
WHERE'S EMILY?
IT'S NOT LIKE HER TO BE LATE.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.122
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE
GOT A HOLD OF HANNA.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.161
YEAH, OR SHE COULD
BE AVOIDING ME.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.737
ALL RIGHT, WELL YOU NEED
TO APOLOGIZE OR GET OVER IT

06:15.770 --> 06:16.839
OR DO WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO DO, OKAY?

06:16.870 --> 06:19.031
I DON'T CARE WHO SAID WHAT
TO WHO, BUT WE NEED ALL

06:19.070 --> 06:21.129
BRAINS ON BOARD AND WE'RE
ALREADY DOWN ONE. YOU GOT IT?

06:21.180 --> 06:22.772
AYE AYE, CAPTAIN.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.479
UGH. TASTE THIS.
IT'S DISGUSTING.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.613
NO, YOU JUST SPIT
IN IT.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.617
( footsteps approaching )

06:30.650 --> 06:31.719
HEY, EM.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.012
YOU TALK TO HANNA?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.049
IS THIS MINE?

06:34.090 --> 06:35.057
YEAH, BUT DON'T.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.225
HOW IS SHE?

06:38.260 --> 06:41.127
FREAKED OUT. SHE'S WAITING
TO HEAR BACK FROM THE D.A.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.025
ABOUT THE CHARGES.
MEANWHILE, THE COPS

06:43.070 --> 06:44.492
ARE RUNNING TESTS ON HER
DAD'S GUN TO SEE

06:44.530 --> 06:46.122
IF IT WAS USED
TO KILL WILDEN.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.159
THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.065
YEAH. IT'S CALLED BALLISTICS.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.069
WHEN YOU FIRE A GUN,
THE BARREL LEAVES GROOVES

06:52.110 --> 06:54.169
ON THE BULLET.
LIKE A PATTERN.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.178
AND IF THE PATI'ERN OF THAT
BARREL MATCHES THE BULLET

06:56.210 --> 06:59.475
THAT KILLED WILDEN, THEN BAM,
THAT'S THE MURDER WEAPON.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.048
AND THERE'S MORE. SHANA'S BACK.
PERMANENTLY.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.114
SHE ENROLLED AT ROSEWOOD HIGH,

07:05.150 --> 07:06.913
AND TOOK MY SPOT
ON THE SWIM TEAM.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.154
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

07:08.190 --> 07:09.726
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GIRL
WHO MAY HAVE TRIED

07:09.760 --> 07:12.058
TO SET US ON FIRE,
RUN YOU OVER, SITTING NEXT

07:12.090 --> 07:13.591
TO US IN SOCIAL STUDIES.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.996
BUT WHY? WHAT DOES
SHANA HAVE AGAINST US?

07:16.030 --> 07:18.123
WELL, MONA SAID SHANA
WAS IN LOVE WITH JENNA.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.195
AND THAT THEY WERE
BOTH AFRAID OF MELISSA...

07:20.240 --> 07:21.093
WHO MOVED TO LONDON.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.461
SO, MELISSA MOVES OUT;
SHANA MOVES IN.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.808
AND JENNA GETS A NEW SEEING
EYE DOG AT ROSEWOOD HIGH.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.808
( plates breaking )

07:27.840 --> 07:30.104
( sighing )

07:31.950 --> 07:33.679
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING,
GUESS WHO'S IN CHARGE

07:33.720 --> 07:36.484
OF TRAINING THE NEW GUY
AND RUNNING THE OPEN MIC
NIGHT TOMORROW?

07:36.520 --> 07:39.148
HEY, LET ME HELP.

07:39.190 --> 07:42.626
JUST SIT DOWN,
SE'I'I'LE IN, OKAY?

07:42.660 --> 07:44.628
I'LL DEAL WITH IT,
MY BROTHER KNOWS HIM.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.055
HI. FIRST DAY?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.863
THAT OBVIOUS?

07:50.900 --> 07:54.563
YOU'RE CONNOR, RIGHT?
YOU PLAY LACYRECASl-ISE WITH MIKE.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.205
( laughs )
WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE
BETTER ON THE FIELD.

07:58.870 --> 08:03.079
I JUST WISH THAT
I COULD ERASE EVERYTHING
FROM THAT NIGHT.

08:03.110 --> 08:07.570
I'M SORRY, TOO. I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU THE REAL
REASON WHY I WAS THERE.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.943
WELL, HOW COULD YOU?
I BULLDOZED OVER EVERY
OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAD.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.049
I BULLDOZED OVER YOU.
I BULLDOZED OVER

08:14.090 --> 08:15.978
HANNA WHEN SHE TRIED
TO TELL ME ABOUT THE GUN.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.885
I'M BASICALLY
A HUMAN BULLDOZER.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.721
AND NOW I'M BULLDOZING
OVER YOUR APOLOGY.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.558
I'M REALLY SORRY.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.273
SO, YOU EXCITED FOR YOUR GAME
ON SATURDAY? GUILFORD, RIGHT?

08:33.310 --> 08:37.144
YEAH. MRS. WELCH IS MAKING
ME REDO THIS ESSAY,

08:37.180 --> 08:39.546
I GOT TO GET AT LEAST
A B OR I'LL BE
SITTING THE BENCH.

08:39.580 --> 08:40.615
HMM.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.548
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.583
MIKE SAYS YOU'RE, LIKE,
SOME WRITING GENIUS.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.088
MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST LOOK IT OVER?
MAKE SURE IT'S IN ENGLISH?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.610
UM...

08:51.990 --> 08:54.049
YEAH, SURE.
I COULD DO THAT.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.692
GREAT.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.897
PH EW.

09:00.270 --> 09:03.103
SHE FOUND THE GUN
IN YOUR BAG, ASHLEY.
IN YOUR CLOSET.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.131
HANNA, HOW COULD
YOU SAY THAT?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.603
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.834
LET HER TALK.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.178
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

09:10.210 --> 09:12.178
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOUR SHOES AND THEN--

09:12.210 --> 09:14.644
THEY WERE RUINED.
I THREW THEM OUT.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.114
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.

09:17.150 --> 09:18.788
IT'S ABOUT WHAT SHE FOUND.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.117
YOU TOOK MY GUN.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.583
TOM, YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.949
WELL, PLEASE, TELL ME!

09:23.990 --> 09:28.222
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE
AND I DID NOT BRING
A GUN INTO THIS HOUSE.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.761
THEN WHO DID, ASHLEY?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.997
I DON'T KNOW. I AM TELLING
THE TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW!

09:33.040 --> 09:36.294
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT
MY GUN WAS USED TO KILL
A POLICE OFFICER--

09:36.340 --> 09:38.035
SOMEONE IS SETTING ME UP!
WHO?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.708
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

09:39.740 --> 09:42.208
I DON'T KNOW.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.844
1--
DO YOU KNOW CRAZY
THIS SOUNDS?

09:43.880 --> 09:46.769
( indistinct conversation )

09:47.750 --> 09:49.115
( sighs )

09:53.290 --> 09:54.689
GUYS.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.120
UGH. MO' MONA,
MO' PROBLEMS.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.149
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

09:58.190 --> 10:00.158
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.088
I'M SORRY;
THAT WASN'T A QUESTION.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.826
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
ALONE.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.098
YOU SAID WE WERE
IN THIS TOGETHER,

10:06.130 --> 10:07.461
AND THEN YOU
JUST DISAPPEARED.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.606
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO
SAY TO SPENCER,
YOU CAN SAY TO ALL OF US.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.839
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.849
I'VE BEEN TRACKING DOWN
MY MISSING R.V.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.098
THAT'S WHERE I'VE BEEN.

10:19.150 --> 10:22.142
TOBY TOOK IT.
HE GAVE IT TO "A",

10:22.180 --> 10:24.114
BUT SPENCER ALREADY
KNEW THAT.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.788
SHE'S BEEN COVERING
FOR HIM.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.214
YOU'RE LYING.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.727
I'M REALLY NOT.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.227
THEN YOU'D
BETTER HAVE PROOF.

10:32.260 --> 10:35.252
LOOK, I'LL TAKE HEELS OVER
A HOODIE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK,

10:35.300 --> 10:37.120
BUT JUST 'CAUSE
I'M NOT "A" ANYMORE,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.730
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T RECON
YOUR ASSES WHEN I NEED TO.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.193
SO, YEAH, I HAVE PROOF.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.178
SPENCER, SAY SOMETHING.

11:02.220 --> 11:05.121
MONA MAY NOT BE "A",
BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY STILL A B.

11:05.160 --> 11:05.888
DID YOU SEE THAT
SMIRK ON HER FACE?

11:07.030 --> 11:09.157
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT SPENCER WOULD
KEEP THAT FROM US.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.259
YOU KNOW THERE WAS
A REASON TOBY DID THIS.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.790
I MEAN, THERE HAS TO BE.
REASON OR NOT,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.139
I CAN'T HELP THINKING HANNA
WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS
IF WE STILL HAD THAT R.V.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.298
WHAT IF MONA HAD SOMETHING
THAT COULD PROVE THAT
HANNA'S MOM WAS INNOCENT?

11:19.340 --> 11:21.877
PROOF THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
WANTED WILDEN DEAD.

11:21.910 --> 11:23.901
A VIDEO, A PHOTO,
ANYTHING.

11:23.950 --> 11:28.171
( phone ringing )

11:28.220 --> 11:29.312
Aria:
HANNA?

11:29.350 --> 11:31.147
MY PARENTS TOOK
MY CELL PHONE,
SO DON'T CALL IT.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.441
OKAY.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.253
HER PARENTS TOOK HER PHONE.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.917
LOOK, HANNA, WE HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.928
WELL, CAN IT WAIT?
THEY COULD PICK UP ANY MINUTE.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.188
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

11:39.230 --> 11:42.051
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
TO TALK TO HER PARENTS.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.397
Hanna:
"A" IS FRAMING MY MOM,

11:43.430 --> 11:45.159
ALL RIGHT.
SHE DIDN'T KILL WILDEN,

11:45.200 --> 11:46.895
SHE DIDN'T PUT THE GUN
IN HER OVERNIGHT BAG.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.760
"A" DID.
I WALKED RIGHT INTO THE TRAP.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.301
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT EMILY THINKS--

11:50.340 --> 11:52.877
I KNOW WHAT EMILY THINKS, BUT
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO THEM.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.935
BECAUSE "A" IS THREATENING
TO TAKE DOWN MY MOM

11:54.980 --> 11:58.006
AND MY DAD IF I SAY ONE THING
ABOUT MY MOM BEING FRAMED.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.143
ONE WORD,
ONE FREAKING LETTER,

12:00.180 --> 12:02.011
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S LOCKED UP.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.189
( sound of phone picking up,
numbers dialing )

12:04.220 --> 12:06.882
Ashley:
TOM, DON'T--

12:06.920 --> 12:07.682
Ashley:
DON'T CALL HER.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.085
Tom:
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THIS.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.326
Ashley:
SHE ALREADY DOES.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.193
SHE DOESN'T WANT US
TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.095
ARE WE GONNA LISTEN?

12:17.430 --> 12:21.332
Ashley: DAMN IT, TOM,
HE THREATENED ME.
HE THREATENED HANNA.

12:21.370 --> 12:23.304
I COULDN'T COME UP WITH
THE KIND OF MONEY
HE WANTED TO GET HIM

12:23.340 --> 12:25.069
TO LEAVE TOWN,
SO I TOOK THE GUN

12:25.110 --> 12:27.101
FOR PROTECTION.

12:27.140 --> 12:30.769
Ashley: YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.209
NO, YOU CAN'T JUST
SHOW UP HERE--
YOU CAME

12:32.250 --> 12:35.014
TO ME FOR MONEY,
AND YOU LEI-T WITH MY GUN.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.472
DON'T ACT LIKE
I'M NOT INVOLVED.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.011
I WAS SCARED, OKAY?

12:39.050 --> 12:42.110
I TOOK THE GUN
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.459
HE GRABBED THE GUN OUT
OF MY HANDS, AND I RAN.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.549
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DID NOT SHOOT HIM.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.522
( pounding on door)

12:54.840 --> 12:56.967
HEY.
HELLO, CALEB.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.159
OH, CALEB.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.336
ARE YOU OKAY?
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU.

12:59.370 --> 13:01.531
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT HANNA,

13:01.580 --> 13:03.070
BUT YOU CANNOT BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.372
NO, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. NOW.

13:04.410 --> 13:07.140
NO, DAD, STOP--
HANNA, PLEASE.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.249
SHE'S IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
THE LESS PEOPLE

13:08.280 --> 13:09.247
SHE SPEAKS TO THE BETTER.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.487
I AM NOT HERE TO QUESTION HER.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

13:11.520 --> 13:15.217
YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
CALEB, WE WILL CALL YOU
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.921
JUST PLEASE, GO.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.208
I KNEW THAT THIS
WOULD HAPPEN.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.073
NOW, INSTEAD OF
FINDING OUT FROM US,
THEY FOUND OUT FROM MONA.

13:40.250 --> 13:44.186
IF WE JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH,
I KNOW THAT THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.859
IF WE TELL THEM,
IT'S OVER.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.619
I'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO MY MOM.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.480
WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.349
TOBY.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.030
I WENT BACK TO RADLEY.

14:00.070 --> 14:04.268
I TALKED TO EDDIE LAMB.
I ASKED HIM ALL ABOUT
WHAT DR. PALMER SAID.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.904
ABOUT THE BLONDE GIRL.
ALL OF IT.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.875
AND WHAT DID HE SAY?
DID HE MENTION ALI?

14:09.910 --> 14:12.470
HE KNOWS SOMETHING,
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA TELL ME.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.943
NEITHER WILL MY DAD.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.369
YOU SPOKE WITH YOUR
FATHER ABOUT THIS?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.082
I TRIED TO.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.610
IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.084
LOOK, I'VE RUN OUT
OF LEADS, SPENCE.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.382
BUT "A" STILL
KNOWS SOMETHING.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.658
"A" IS THE ONLY CHANCE
I HAVE OF FINDING OUT

14:27.700 --> 14:30.021
WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED TO MY MOM.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.363
SPENCER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:38.410 --> 14:40.105
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA FORCE
YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND,

14:40.140 --> 14:42.506
BUT I HAVE TO FIX THIS,
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.407
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
I'VE GOT TO EARN
BACK SOME TRUST.

14:45.450 --> 14:46.644
( phone ringing )

14:46.680 --> 14:47.977
GIRL ( over phone ):
GAMMA ZETA CHI.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.545
HI, MY NAME IS SPENCER...

14:53.190 --> 14:55.385
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
COPIED THE CLIFF'S NOTES.
WELL, IT WAS THE ONLY

14:55.420 --> 14:58.253
THING THAT MADE SENSE.
AND I USED PROPER CITATION.

14:58.290 --> 15:03.068
YES, I SEE THAT.
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE
FOOTNOTE FOR WIKIPEDIA.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.526
CONNOR?

15:06.570 --> 15:08.993
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.235
I'M HELPING HIM
WITH HIS ENGLISH PAPER.

15:11.270 --> 15:14.137
YOU GOING OUT?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.205
YEAH, WHAT'S IT
LOOK LIKE?

15:16.240 --> 15:18.276
OKAY, WELL WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO BE BACK?

15:18.310 --> 15:19.242
LATER.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.168
DID YOU TALK TO MOM TODAY?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.175
YEP.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.448
HEY, HAVE FUN.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.420
ALL RIGHT, SO...

15:31.460 --> 15:35.419
PAGE THREE.
JUST BECAUSE FAULKNER
USED RUN-ON SENTENCES,

15:35.460 --> 15:36.688
DOES NOT MEAN
THAT YOU GET TO.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.062
IS HE COOL WITH ME
BEING HERE?

15:42.340 --> 15:44.934
YEAH, IT'S NOT
ABOUT YOU.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.998
( knock on door)

15:50.050 --> 15:53.042
HAN NA?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.048
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THEY LET YOU IN.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.640
MY DAD PRACTICALLY
THREW CALEB OUT THE DOOR.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.011
I BROUGHT AN EXCUSE.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.413
HOMEWORK.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.024
THANK YOU.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.652
WAIT, I'M NOT IN PHYSICS.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.225
I WAS COUNTING ON YOUR
PARENTS NOT KNOWING THAT.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.328
MUST BE WEIRD
HAVING YOUR DAD HERE.

16:14.370 --> 16:17.066
I HAVEN'T REALLY
FOUND A WORD FOR IT YET.
BUT YEAH.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.465
HOW ARE YOU?
REALLY.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.330
I'M IN PURGATORY.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.473
A CONDITION OF TEMPORARY
PUNISHMENT AND SUFFERING,

16:23.510 --> 16:26.445
FROM WHICH I MAY
NEVER LEAVE.
I LOOKED IT UP.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.574
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING I COULD
FIND ON PROSECUTING MINORS

16:29.620 --> 16:33.408
AND STATE MINIMUMS FOR
THIRD-DEGREE FEDERAL OFFENSES.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.451
THAT WAS BEFORE THEY TOOK
AWAY MY INTERNET.

16:35.490 --> 16:38.357
IF YOUR MOM DIDN'T...

16:38.390 --> 16:41.223
DO IT, THEN IT MAY NOT
BE THE GUN, HANNA.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.420
OKAY, WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.462
"A" CAN'T TAM PER WITH
BALLISTICS EVIDENCE.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.764
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT "A" CAN
AND CANNOT DO.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.030
THE SOONER WE ACCEPT
THAT THE BETTER.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.504
LOOK, I'M NOT JUST HERE
FOR FAKE HOMEWORK.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.508
I WANT THE DASH CAM
FOOTAGE THAT MONA GAVE YOU.

16:53.540 --> 16:54.632
THE ONE FROM
WILDEN'S CAR.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.375
NO. HELL NO.

16:56.410 --> 16:57.775
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WANT IT FOR.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.072
I DON'T CARE.
EMILY,

16:59.110 --> 17:03.547
MY MOM IS IN THAT VIDEO HITTING
WILDEN WITH A CAR, ALL RIGHT.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.410
I SHOULD HAVE JUST
LISTENED TO MONA
AND BURNED IT

17:05.450 --> 17:06.747
THE SECOND THAT
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.814
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.213
THE FIRST HALF OF THE VIDEO
LOOKS BAD FOR YOUR MOM,

17:09.260 --> 17:13.424
BUT THE SECOND HALF PROVES
THAT JENNA AND SHANA ARE
CONNECTED TO WILDEN.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.257
THEY CARRIED HIM OFF
THE ROAD IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

17:15.300 --> 17:18.519
AND NO ONE REPORTED ANYTHING.
THE COPS NEED TO SEE THAT.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.391
IT COULD LOOK LIKE
THEY WERE HURTING HIM,
AND NOT HELPING HIM.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.068
AND AT THE VERY LEAST,
IT ADDS IN TWO MORE
SUSPECT S TO THE MIX.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.328
LOOK, ANYTHING I DO
BACKFIRES.

17:26.370 --> 17:29.430
IF I SAY ONE WORD ABOUT
"A", MY DAD GOES DOWN.
DO YOU GET THAT?

17:29.480 --> 17:32.074
THAT'S IF YOU SAY SOMETHING,
HANNA, NOT ME.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.214
PLEASE, HANNA.
THIS COULD BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

18:13.590 --> 18:14.079
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.185
NO, I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.448
THIS WAS FUN.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.320
I TOLD YOU FAULKNER
WASN'T ALL THAT BAD.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.124
I MEANT YOU.
IT'S NICE HANGING
OUT WITH YOU.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.467
THAN KS.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.365
YEAH, NEXT TIME WE OUGHT
TO DO THIS OVER BURGERS
INSTEAD OF BOOKS.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.403
OH, NO.
YOU DON'T NEED
THAT MUCH HELP.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.839
YOU'LL DO FINE.
( chuckles )

18:32.870 --> 18:34.474
OH, BUT HAVE
A GREAT GAME SATURDAY.

18:34.510 --> 18:38.173
GO SPORTS, AND ALL THAT.
( chuckles )

18:41.450 --> 18:45.284
I'M SORRY,
I'M NOT INTERESTED
LIKE THAT.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.413
( chuckles nervously)

19:31.570 --> 19:33.561
( food sizzling )

19:33.600 --> 19:36.398
ASHLEY.
ASHLEY!

19:36.440 --> 19:39.432
YOU TRYING TO BURN
THE HOUSE DOWN?

19:39.470 --> 19:42.439
IT'S FINE. I'M FINE.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.441
NO, YOU'RE NOT FINE.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.442
WHAT DID VERONICA SAY?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.812
THEY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING YET.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.623
WHAT ELSE?

19:59.460 --> 20:01.428
ASH.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.566
THE FACT THAT WE
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING,

20:04.600 --> 20:07.239
NOT ABOUT HAN NA,
NOT ABOUT THE GUN...

20:11.470 --> 20:13.904
IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.504
OH! DAMN IT!

20:19.550 --> 20:21.438
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

20:21.480 --> 20:22.469
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
FOR TWO SECONDS.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.219
JUST, HOLD ONTO THIS.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.328
JUST TELL ME
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.590
Tom:
PEOPLE COULD BELIEVE THAT.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.632
I COULD BELIEVE THAT.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.262
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT, TOM.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.438
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.473
Emily:
HANNA WANTED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.445
SHE ALSO WANTED ME
TO COP A FEEL ON
HER BEHALF, BUT...

20:58.490 --> 21:01.482
HER PARENTS SAID THEY
WOULD CALL ME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED,

21:01.520 --> 21:03.579
BUT I HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.349
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.028
WE HAVE THE TRUTH
ON OUR SIDE THIS TIME.

21:08.530 --> 21:11.567
THANKS FOR THIS.
YEAH.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.022
Spencer:
EM!

21:13.070 --> 21:14.731
HEY, EMILY.

21:14.770 --> 21:18.467
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
I KNOW WHO ALI WAS CALLING.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.307
AT LEAST I THINK I DO.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.477
I WAS TALKING TO ALL
OF THESE SORORITY GIRLS,

21:21.510 --> 21:23.307
AND THEY DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
A HIDDEN ROOM,

21:23.350 --> 21:25.739
BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
THERE WAS THIS HOUSEMOTHER--

21:25.780 --> 21:27.475
THE GRUNWALD.
YEAH.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.819
EXACTLY. AND SHE WOULD
DISAPPEAR FOR HOURS
AT A TIME,

21:30.850 --> 21:33.353
AND THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
POOF, SHE WOULD REAPPEAR

21:33.390 --> 21:35.449
AS IF SHE'D NEVER
LEI-T THE HOUSE.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.754
WHAT IF MRS. GRUNWALD
WAS USING THAT
HIDDEN ROOM?

21:37.790 --> 21:39.485
WHAT IF THAT'S
WHO ALI WAS CALLING?

21:39.530 --> 21:41.521
I DON'T THINK
THE GRUNWALD
WORE BOARD SHORTS.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.495
OKAY, SO WE GOT
THAT PART WRONG.
BUT THIS IS OUR CHANCE

21:44.530 --> 21:47.590
TO GET IT RIGHT.
MRS. GRUNWALD COULD
KNOW WHO WAS AI-TER ALI.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.609
IT COULD BE "A".
IT COULD BE THE SAME PERSON
WHO'S FRAMING HANNA'S MOM.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.700
LOOK, YOU WANNA
HELP HANNA, RIGHT?
SO, LET'S GO TALK

21:53.740 --> 21:55.537
TO MRS. GRUNWALD TODAY,
OKAY? YOU AND ME.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.572
SPENCER, STOP.
HAVING MONA'S R.V.
COULD'VE HELPED HANNA.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.441
AND I'M NOT GOING
ON ANOTHER WILD GOOSE
CHASE WITH YOU

22:00.480 --> 22:02.414
JUST SO YOU CAN CLEAR
YOUR GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

22:02.450 --> 22:05.442
LOOK, I WANT TO EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING, BUT I JUST
CAN'T. NOT YET.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.754
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT TOBY,
BUT I REALLY WISH

22:07.790 --> 22:09.610
YOU'D THINK ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU
WERE HURTING.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.019
( sighs )

22:17.970 --> 22:20.939
( classical music playing )

22:51.000 --> 22:52.627
HEY.

22:52.670 --> 22:54.160
HI. WHAT'S UP?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.838
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

22:55.870 --> 22:57.838
DO WHAT?

22:57.870 --> 23:00.634
HOOK UP WITH CONNOR
LAST NIGHT!

23:00.680 --> 23:03.035
WHAT?

23:03.080 --> 23:04.604
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

23:04.650 --> 23:07.414
WHERE DO YOU THINK?
I WAS JUST IN
THE LOCKER ROOM.

23:07.450 --> 23:08.519
AND YOU CAN'T...

23:19.660 --> 23:21.890
( laughing )

23:21.930 --> 23:24.660
EXCUSE ME.
HI, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.622
Boy: SHE CAN'T GET
ENOUGH, CAN SHE?

23:26.670 --> 23:27.830
MM-MMM.

23:29.470 --> 23:32.564
ALL RIGHT, IN CASE YOU
OR ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE CONFUSED,

23:32.610 --> 23:35.431
YOU TRIED TO KISS ME,
AND I PUSHED YOU OFF,
AND THEN YOU LEI-T.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.902
ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.578
THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED,
OKAY?

23:38.610 --> 23:40.077
YOU CAN QUIT
THE INNOCENT VIRGIN ACT.

23:40.110 --> 23:41.611
( gasping )

23:41.650 --> 23:44.141
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:44.190 --> 23:47.512
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU
AND MR. FITZ WEREN'T
JUST SCRABBLE BUDDIES.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.913
EXCUSE ME?

23:48.960 --> 23:51.520
HOW MANY POINTS
FOR THE WORD "SLUT"?

23:51.560 --> 23:52.982
( boys snickering )

23:58.970 --> 24:01.837
MS. MONTGOMERY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.683
YOU STILL OKAY ON GAS?

24:19.720 --> 24:21.654
YEAH.

24:21.690 --> 24:25.956
( slow song playing )

24:25.990 --> 24:29.653
IS SHE EXPECTING YOU?
MRS. GRUNWALD?

24:29.700 --> 24:31.725
NO.

24:32.870 --> 24:36.567
* MY WEAKNESS
YOUR SCORE *

24:36.600 --> 24:37.965
* REMEMBER ME

24:38.010 --> 24:39.864
I'M SORRY, SPENCER.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.608
I KNOW.

24:45.650 --> 24:52.613
* WILL WE ALL FALL
WILL WE ALL FALL DOWN *

24:54.120 --> 24:57.009
* WE ALL FALL DOWN

25:00.090 --> 25:04.595
* I'VE TRIED TO TELL
THE TRUTH SO MANY TIMES *

25:04.630 --> 25:09.590
* AND I'VE BEEN ALIVE
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT *

25:09.640 --> 25:10.959
* AND IT'S NOT MINE

25:11.010 --> 25:12.034
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:14.840 --> 25:17.274
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?

25:17.310 --> 25:20.279
BEFORE I CAME IN.

25:20.310 --> 25:24.940
ARIA, THOSE GUYS ARE JERKS.
YOU CAN'T JUST LET SOME
STUPID RUMOR GET TO YOU--

25:24.990 --> 25:28.118
IT'S NOT "SOME STUPID RUMOR"
IF THERE'S SOME TRUTH
TO IT, EZRA.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.254
LOOK, YOU CANNOT BE
THE GUY THAT HELPS ME
FEEL BETTER ANYMORE.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.619
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

25:35.660 --> 25:38.663
JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME.
PLEASE.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.203
( church bell ringing )

26:09.160 --> 26:11.663
( birds squawking )

26:40.160 --> 26:42.651
DO YOU SEE A STREET SIGN
ANYWHERE?

26:42.700 --> 26:46.625
NO. NOTHING.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.237
Little Girl:
MOMMY, COME ON.

26:51.270 --> 26:52.760
Spencer:
EXCUSE ME.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.209
SORRY, I THINK WE'RE LOST.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.244
DO YOU KNOW IF
SAW MILL ROAD IS UP AHEAD?

27:12.860 --> 27:14.293
Toby:
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.845
( students talking
indistinctly )

27:40.190 --> 27:42.283
MONA. WE NEED TO TALK.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.426
WE'RE TALKING NOW?
TELL ME WHAT "A"
HAS ON TOBY.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.779
'KAY? I NEED TO KNOW.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.094
DON'T WE ALL?
MONA, PLEASE.
I WANT IN.

27:51.130 --> 27:53.837
ON WHAT?
ON WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE GOING ON.

27:53.870 --> 27:56.896
YOU TRACKED DOWN YOUR R.V.
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT
SPENCER AND TOBY.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.807
YOU'VE GOT THE FAST TRACK
ON "A", WHILE THE REST
HAVE NOTHING.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.902
I'M NOT THE ONE PULLING
THE STRINGS ANYMORE, EMILY.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.713
ALL I HAVE IS AN EMPTY R.V.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.040
EVERYTHING BAD THAT
I'VE DONE,
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE,

28:12.090 --> 28:14.251
"A" HAS PROOF.

28:14.290 --> 28:17.054
ONE WRONG MOVE
AND WE ALL GO UP IN FLAMES.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.955
MAYBE THIS TIME,
WE DON'T GET OUT OF THEM.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.489
ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS THE RIGHT PLACE?
YEAH, THIS IS THE ADDRESS.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.839
EXCUSE ME?

28:47.490 --> 28:49.788
HI. WE WERE HOPING
TO SPEAK WITH MRS. GRUNWALD.

28:49.820 --> 28:50.855
IS SHE HOME?

28:53.130 --> 28:55.098
IT'S IMPORTANT.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.928
THERE'S NO ONE HERE BUT ME.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.393
AND I ONLY DEAL WITH
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.101
WELL, WE MUST HAVE
THE WRONG ADDRESS.

29:25.290 --> 29:31.195
( phone dialing )

29:31.230 --> 29:33.494
( phone ringing )

29:38.240 --> 29:40.105
I'M STARVING.
LET'S GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.973
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I MEAN, I HAVE A LARGE
PIT IN MY STOMACH,

29:43.010 --> 29:44.875
BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.400
YOU DEFINITELY NEED
TO EAT SOMETHING.

29:46.450 --> 29:49.419
I'M NOT DRIVING BACK TO ROSEWOOD
WITH LOW-BLOOD-SUGAR SPENCER.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.486
THAT'S WORSE THAN
NO-CAFFEINE SPENCER.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.910
WOW, YOUR GIRLFRIEND
SOUNDS AWESOME.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.385
IT WAS THREE SUMMERS AGO.
IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS.

30:26.390 --> 30:28.210
WELL, I MUST HAVE MISSED IT.

30:28.260 --> 30:32.082
WELL, MY FRIENDS
AND I AREN'T REALLY
SURE THAT SHE'S GONE.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.620
MAYBE YOU STILL
KNOW THIS PERSON.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.595
I DIDN'T KNOW HER ALIVE.
I CERTAINLY DON'T
KNOW HER DEAD.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.996
MAYBE YOU ONLY SPOKE
WITH HER ON THE PHONE.

30:39.030 --> 30:40.588
SHE MIGHT'VE GONE
BY THE NAME VIVIAN.

30:42.170 --> 30:45.003
SHE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY
WAS AI-TER HER, SO MAYBE
SHE WAS ASKING FOR HELP,

30:46.340 --> 30:49.275
I'M SORRY,
IT DOESN'T RING A BELL.

30:49.310 --> 30:52.609
THE GIRLS SAID YOU
DISAPPEARED EVERYDAY
FOR HOURS AT A TIME

30:52.650 --> 30:54.641
AND THEN YOU WOULD
SUDDENLY REAPPEAR
AS IF YOU'D NEVER LEI-T.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.012
SO, I KNOW THAT IT
WAS YOU ON THAT PHONE.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.518
Spencer:
AND THEN ONE DAY YOU
WERE GONE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

30:59.550 --> 31:01.359
WERE YOU RUNNING
SOME KIND OF BUSINESS?

31:01.390 --> 31:05.121
Mrs. Grunwald:
I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND, REALLY.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.049
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.591
I'M NOT WHO YOU
THINK I AM.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.897
EXCUSE ME.

31:23.680 --> 31:27.548
( phone ringing )

31:35.390 --> 31:36.550
( knocking on door)

31:36.590 --> 31:38.581
GO AWAY.

31:41.960 --> 31:42.995
HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

31:43.030 --> 31:44.895
MIKE, JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE, PLEASE.

31:51.970 --> 31:52.868
ARIA--
LOOK,

31:52.910 --> 31:55.606
I'M SORRY YOUR WHOLE TEAM
THINKS I'M A SLUT.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.041
I'M SORRY ABOUT MOM GOING AWAY.
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.210
( sighing )

32:11.190 --> 32:13.181
I MESSED UP.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.061
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT CONNOR WAS MAKING
THAT STUFF UP.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.691
LOOK, I'M YOUR BROTHER.

32:22.740 --> 32:25.038
I'M SUPPOSED
TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.662
STAND UP FOR YOU.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.348
I'M GONNA MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, OKAY?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.614
OKAY?

32:54.700 --> 32:56.190
WHERE YOU BEEN?

32:56.240 --> 33:01.007
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I JUST NEEDED SOME AIR.

33:03.780 --> 33:08.615
YOU KNOW, I TOOK
THE OLD FOOTPATH
BEHIND THE MENDEZ HOUSE.

33:08.650 --> 33:11.483
THE ONE THAT LEADS
TO THE POND.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.715
( chuckles )

33:13.750 --> 33:16.651
YOU USED TO TAKE ME SKATING
THERE WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.423
NOW IT'S ALL DRIED UP.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.799
THAT HAPPENS THIS
TIME OF YEAR.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.264
BUT IT'LL FILL UP AGAIN.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.659
( sighs )
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.341
IT'S MY FAULT THAT
MOM EVER GOT INVOLVED
WITH WILDEN.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.610
IT'S MY FAULT
THE POLICE FOUND THE GUN.

33:41.650 --> 33:45.780
GOD, HOW COULD
I BE SO STUPID?

33:45.820 --> 33:49.779
I MEAN, I TRY TO FIX THINGS.
AND IT JUST...

33:49.820 --> 33:51.321
IT JUST GETS WORSE.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.555
HANNA, I WISH YOU'D
COME TO ME.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.392
YEAH.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.569
WELL, THE WAY CALEB
DESCRIBED IT...

34:06.710 --> 34:08.530
HON ESTLY, DAD...

34:11.810 --> 34:14.210
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WANTED ME TO.

34:37.670 --> 34:40.434
SHE WOULD RATHER FRY
THE HAIR OFF HER HEAD
THAN TALK TO ME.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.108
SHE COULD BE
TELLING THE TRUTH.

34:42.140 --> 34:43.437
SHE'S NOT.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.708
I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO BACK HOME

34:44.750 --> 34:47.401
EMPTY-HANDED,
BUT WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

34:47.450 --> 34:50.339
YOU'RE FOLLOWING
A LEAD THAT CAME
FROM A BIRD.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.280
MAYBE IT WAS NEVER
A REAL CLUE.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.414
MAYBE ALISON'S GRANDMOTHER
CALLED THAT NUMBER
INSTEAD OF ALI.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.678
YOU HAVE TO LEARN WHEN
TO LET GO, SPENCER.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.827
ME? I NEED TO LEARN
WHEN TO LET THINGS GO?

35:01.860 --> 35:04.397
I MIGHT BE TRUSTING A BIRD,
BUT YOU'RE TRUSTING "A".

35:06.830 --> 35:10.664
I'M GONNA GO SEE WHAT
THEY HAVE ACROSS THE STREET.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.134
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANYTHING?

35:25.820 --> 35:30.382
( choir singing in distance )

35:41.600 --> 35:43.591
( choir continues )

36:01.820 --> 36:03.879
( church bells ringing )

36:50.900 --> 36:52.458
SPENCER,
WHAT IS IT?

36:52.510 --> 36:54.330
SHANA'S HERE.
I JUST SAW HER.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.402
Toby:
THAT'S JENNA'S CAR.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.348
COME ON.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.787
GET IN, GET IN!
GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO, GO.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.858
WHAT WAS THAT?

37:10.890 --> 37:13.324
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.349
( gasping )

37:16.900 --> 37:18.367
OH, MY GOD.

37:32.950 --> 37:36.317
* IF YOU NEED MY HANDS TO PULL
YOU UP ABOVE THE EARTH *

37:40.790 --> 37:43.008
* WELL I WILL LII-T YOU UP

37:43.060 --> 37:48.498
* TO SHOW YOU JUST
HOW MUCH YOU'RE WORTH *

37:48.530 --> 37:50.748
CHOCOLATE OR RASPBERRY?

37:50.800 --> 37:52.495
'KAY, YOU CAN STOP
WITH THE SYMPATHY FOOD.

37:52.530 --> 37:55.533
HMM.
CHOCOLATE. OBVIOUSLY.

37:59.940 --> 38:01.908
LOOK, IF I COULD'VE
HAD ANYONE ELSE
WORKING TONIGHT,

38:01.940 --> 38:02.907
YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.908
NO, IT'S FINE. REALLY.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.770
AND PLUS I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

38:06.810 --> 38:09.916
SAYS MY SUDDENLY WISE
YOUNGER BROTHER.

38:09.950 --> 38:13.841
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER, I DID
PUT HIM ON GARBAGE DUTY.

38:13.890 --> 38:14.857
HUH, IT DOES.
THANK YOU.

38:14.890 --> 38:15.857
( footsteps approaching )

38:15.890 --> 38:18.051
HEY.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.924
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE
STILL TALKING TO ME?

38:21.960 --> 38:22.949
YEAH.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.522
HOW WAS THE GRUNWALD?

38:25.570 --> 38:26.821
SHE SAID THAT SHE
DIDN'T KNOW ALI.

38:26.870 --> 38:28.929
BUT I THINK THAT SHANA
GOT TO HER FIRST.

38:28.970 --> 38:30.369
YOU THINK OR YOU KNOW?

38:30.400 --> 38:33.801
I SAW HER THERE.
SHANA. IN CREEPY-VILLE.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.305
WHAT IS LIEUTENANT TANNER
DOING HERE?

38:40.980 --> 38:43.312
MAYBE SHE'S
INTO SLAM POETRY?

38:47.850 --> 38:48.817
EMILY.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.816
LIEUTENANT TANNER, HI.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.487
DID MY MOM TELL YOU
ABOUT THE EVENT TONIGHT?

38:52.530 --> 38:54.896
UH-UH. I SAW A FLYER
UP AT THE STATION.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.750
BUT I'M NOT HERE
FOR THE MUSIC.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.768
CAN YOU GET SOMEONE
TO COVER YOU FOR YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

38:58.800 --> 39:00.495
ME?
UH-HUH.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.691
UM, YEAH. SURE.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.503
GOOD. I NEED YOU
AT THE STATION.

39:04.540 --> 39:06.599
ALONE.
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.552
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE YOU?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.492
I DON'T KNOW.

39:33.530 --> 39:36.693
SOMEONE SAW YOU HERE THIS
MORNING PUTTING UP A FLYER.

39:36.740 --> 39:40.506
AN HOUR LATER
I FIND THIS ON MY DESK.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.428
I DIDN'T WRITE THIS.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.972
THERE'S A MOTHER'S DAY CARD
ON YOUR MOM'S DESK.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.898
HANDWRITING'S A MATCH.

39:49.850 --> 39:51.078
Emily:
DID SHE SEE THIS?

39:51.120 --> 39:52.985
NOT YET.

39:54.790 --> 39:57.850
LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T
PUT THIS ON MY DESK.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.881
WHO DID?

39:59.930 --> 40:03.024
IT'S PROBABLY SOMEONE'S
IDEA OF A PRANK.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.858
SOME PRANK.
FRAMING SOMEONE FOR MURDER.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.822
( phone ringing )

40:07.870 --> 40:09.963
HOLBROOK?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.798
OKAY. I'M COMING.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.899
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CONTINUE THIS LATER.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.911
FIRST HANNA, NOW EMILY.

40:21.950 --> 40:22.871
DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.875
LIKE WHAT?

40:23.920 --> 40:25.217
LIKE ONE OF US IS NEXT.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.888
TELL ME ABOUT SHANA.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.182
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH
TO TELL, REALLY.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.586
I SAW HER IN THAT TOWN,
AND THEN SHE JUMPED
IN JENNA'S CAR

40:30.620 --> 40:31.450
AND SHE DROVE AWAY.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.720
WE TRIED TO FOLLOW,
BUT WE LOST HER.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.897
( classical music playing )

40:34.930 --> 40:36.625
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

40:53.110 --> 40:55.442
( indistinct conversations )

42:00.210 --> 42:01.973
HEY, STOP!
STOP, THAT'S MY CAR.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.044
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:20.930 --> 42:23.034
Tanner:
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

42:23.070 --> 42:24.765
IN A COURT OF LAW.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

42:24.810 --> 42:26.903
TO AN ATTORNEY,
IF YOU--
SHE DIDN'T DO IT!

42:26.940 --> 42:28.635
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED
TO YOU--
YOU HAVE TO

42:28.680 --> 42:30.773
BELIEVE ME.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

42:30.810 --> 42:33.040
MOM! COME ONE,
TELL HER THAT
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.913
THAT GUN WAS USED TO KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN,

42:35.950 --> 42:38.214
AND YOUR MOTHER'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ON THE BULLETS.

42:40.950 --> 42:43.350
I NEED YOU TO LOOK
AFTER HANNA.

42:43.390 --> 42:46.086
WHATEVER SHE NEEDS.
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ME,
PLEASE...

42:46.130 --> 42:48.690
( sighs )
MOM...

42:48.730 --> 42:50.698
I LOVE YOU.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.368
( engine starts )
