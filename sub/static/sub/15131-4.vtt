Did you, um...

did you get any sleep?

01:10.031 --> 01:13.199

Looks like you're healing.

H.R. policy... any doctor who
suffers a trauma in the hospital

02:03.449 --> 02:06.084
I had a patient

I believe he wanted me
to give this to Selena.

02:09.173 --> 02:10.286
I'll give it to her.

02:10.336 --> 02:11.755
No, it's okay. I can just hand it to her myself.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.591
- I'll be two seconds.
- No way.

- Yes, I am a doctor, but I don't work here.

at my brother's arm?

- Okay.

for bleeding in your abdomen.

The patient's love-handles are fatty.

04:36.729 --> 04:37.583
There's no way that those shears

04:37.633 --> 04:39.296
- could've penetrated the fascia.
Man: - S-she just called me fat!

04:39.346 --> 04:41.009
I-I meant fleshy, sir.

04:41.059 --> 04:43.670
Okay, there's no free fluid
in the abdomen. You're lucky.

04:43.705 --> 04:45.505
I think it's safe to take the shears out.

04:45.573 --> 04:47.808
- I'll do it.
- No, no. This is Reid's patient.

GSW, and from the looks of
things, there's no exit wound.

05:31.684 --> 05:33.919
Small caliber. .22, maybe?

05:33.987 --> 05:35.153
You see a lot of this kind of stuff here?

05:35.221 --> 05:36.989
No, but I was a field medic in Afghanistan,

05:37.056 --> 05:38.357
so I've seen it before.

05:38.391 --> 05:40.625
Penetrating wound like this
definitely needs imaging.

05:41.242 --> 05:44.037
I mean, there's no exit wound, so,
you know, it could've migrated to

05:44.087 --> 05:46.579
just about anywhere. It's an
extremely dangerous situation.

05:46.629 --> 05:48.131
- I need to call an ambulance right now.
- No!

05:48.181 --> 05:49.773
- Hey, what are you doing?
- No hospitals.

05:49.823 --> 05:51.603
You need to go
to an emergency room right now.

while we are sleeping,

And then shoots me.

Do we have a wound debridement tray, please?

He's in really rough shape right now!

but you do not understand.

07:42.972 --> 07:44.133
Listen, nobody's calling the cops.

07:44.183 --> 07:46.474
- Let's sit down and talk about this.

your options here, man.

is gay, okay?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.770
Okay, I'm sorry. I know the situation there.

08:15.838 --> 08:17.939
Then you know if I go home, I'll be killed.

08:18.006 --> 08:19.473
We can't go home.

08:22.858 --> 08:24.145
Okay, I'll take out the bullet.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.613
- Let's take it out.
- Yeah.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.348
- Okay.
- Let's go.

08:27.415 --> 08:29.216
- I'll take the bullet out.
- All right.

Well, Glen, your lungs sound crackly.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.137
And with your fever being so high,

09:25.172 --> 09:26.872
I'm going to have to admit you.

09:26.940 --> 09:28.107
Oh, I-I never get sick.

09:28.175 --> 09:30.276
I never spent a single day in a hospital.

You're gonna miss your trip to Point Pelee.

09:32.512 --> 09:34.046

09:34.080 --> 09:36.715
I was hoping to get a glimpse of
the redheaded woodpecker today.

09:36.749 --> 09:39.818
I always get a photo of it
for Rita every year.

09:39.852 --> 09:42.454
Well, if your fever goes down
and your lungs improve,

09:42.488 --> 09:45.990
- you will be out birding again soon.
- Whoo-hoo!

09:46.025 --> 09:49.494
Never spent a day
in a hospital... that's lucky.

09:49.529 --> 09:51.696
Well, it's uneventful, that's true.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.131
[coughing]

09:53.165 --> 09:55.900
Okay, Glenny, I'm gonna go
and get some of your things.

09:55.935 --> 09:57.368
You might need your slippers.

09:57.402 --> 09:59.904
We'll keep a close eye on him, all right?

09:59.939 --> 10:01.072
Mm-hmm.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.910
Slowing down, Alex? Need a nap?

10:05.945 --> 10:09.814
- Nope.
- Fantastic.

10:09.848 --> 10:11.949
[siren wailing in distance]

10:15.687 --> 10:19.890
[sighs] Manual extraction
of an impacted bowel...

10:19.924 --> 10:21.925
haven't done that since med school.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.694
[chuckles] It's not so bad.

10:23.729 --> 10:25.762
Yeah, I'm just not a big fan of poo.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.097
[chuckles]

10:27.131 --> 10:28.765
Alex, are you bleeding?

10:31.569 --> 10:32.569
You okay?

10:32.603 --> 10:34.171
Yeah, it's nothing. I'm fine.

10:34.205 --> 10:36.706
No, you're not. Come on.

10:39.443 --> 10:40.943
[clears throat]

10:40.978 --> 10:44.080
I think the underwire of your
bra is yanking on your staples.

10:44.114 --> 10:46.182
I'm gonna put a dressing on it, okay?

10:46.216 --> 10:48.351
Okay.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.521
Are you afraid to look at your own blood?

10:51.555 --> 10:52.989
[sighs]

10:54.925 --> 10:55.892
I didn't used to be.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.060
Hmm.

10:58.128 --> 11:00.196
Just don't say anything, okay?

11:00.264 --> 11:02.932
Right.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.302
There's something else you might
remember about the old you.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.704
She had loyal friends.

11:08.738 --> 11:09.972
Still does.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.909
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:13.976 --> 11:15.778
So, you're worried about Dr. Murphy?

11:15.845 --> 11:17.646
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.816
You're an orthopedic surgeon.
Has he broken his wrist?

11:20.884 --> 11:21.983
Shrink humor.

11:22.018 --> 11:24.820
- He's a friend.
- Just a friend?

11:24.854 --> 11:25.954
Yes, he's my doctor, Stu.

11:26.022 --> 11:27.856
And he's been canceling my appointments.

11:27.924 --> 11:30.591
And, uh, well, he doesn't seem like himself.

11:30.659 --> 11:32.294
Well, if he's not seeing his patients,

11:32.361 --> 11:34.662
I'm his department head.
I could talk to him.

11:34.696 --> 11:37.098
Thank you.

11:37.166 --> 11:40.936
[breathing deeply]

11:41.003 --> 11:43.104
[sighs]

11:46.175 --> 11:47.408
[door opens]

11:47.476 --> 11:49.544
- Gavin: Dr. Dey.
- [sighs]

11:52.247 --> 11:54.715
Thanks for sharing an office with me.

11:54.783 --> 11:56.116
Don't you ever knock?

11:56.184 --> 11:57.518
No.

12:00.456 --> 12:01.456
You a vegetarian?

12:01.490 --> 12:03.857
- No.
- Your washing machine broken?

12:04.826 --> 12:06.994
No, it works fine, thank you.

12:07.028 --> 12:08.028
I see.

12:08.096 --> 12:10.097
Band T-shirt, listless demeanor...

12:10.131 --> 12:11.365
you're heartbroken.

12:14.336 --> 12:16.603
Well [sighs]

12:16.637 --> 12:18.705
nothing you can do about that.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.911
[door closes]

12:24.946 --> 12:26.913
[breathes deeply]

12:29.851 --> 12:31.485
Ugh.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.221
Oh.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.924
[chuckling] Hello! Yes!

12:38.959 --> 12:41.294
Yes! Mmm.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.664
Mmm.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.637
[door opens]

12:51.671 --> 12:54.039
[clears throat, sighs]

12:54.073 --> 12:56.041
Forgot my luescher color cards.

13:01.314 --> 13:05.283
You familiar with the nature of
my clinical trial, Dr. Murphy?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.586
Palliative patients. Drug trial.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.022
I'm documenting the effects of LSD

13:10.056 --> 13:12.190
on the anxiety of terminal patients.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.758
And, uh...

13:13.792 --> 13:17.396
those sugar cubes are the delivery method.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.834
How many did you take?

13:22.868 --> 13:24.369
Three.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.738
Yeah. You'll be tripping soon.

13:26.772 --> 13:31.609
But don't worry,
it'll only last 12 to 14 hours.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.944
[breathing shallowly]

13:32.978 --> 13:34.145
Hi, Glen.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.247
- Jackson, what's going on?
- SATs are dropping,

13:36.281 --> 13:37.815
and he's having a hard time
catching his breath.

13:37.889 --> 13:39.264
- Even with the nasal prongs?
- Yeah.

13:39.314 --> 13:40.423
[weakly] I want Rita.

13:40.514 --> 13:43.630
Okay, can you, uh, go and try to
find Mrs. Brown for me, please?

13:43.680 --> 13:46.823
Okay, try to remain calm.
I'm gonna have a listen.

13:50.395 --> 13:52.996
Hi, there, Glen. I'm Dr. Bell.

13:53.031 --> 13:54.731
Everything okay here?

13:54.766 --> 13:55.802
He's having trouble breathing.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.753
Dawn?

13:57.063 --> 13:59.735
Hey, Jackson, can you just elevate the head
of his bed a little further?

13:59.785 --> 14:00.572
Yeah.

14:00.627 --> 14:03.106
Alex, what are you hearing?

14:03.140 --> 14:05.141
Nothing. I can't hear a heart.

14:08.131 --> 14:10.200
Joel: - Okay.
- Yes, yes. Like that.

14:10.269 --> 14:12.270
- There we are.
- Just like that. You're strong.

14:12.337 --> 14:13.638
Didn't even travel very far at all.

14:13.705 --> 14:15.139
Look!

14:15.206 --> 14:16.340
There... whoa!

14:16.408 --> 14:17.441
Look at me!

14:17.509 --> 14:18.976
Get me some pressure on this, please.

14:19.043 --> 14:20.443
Tourniquet him as tight as we can.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.979
We need as much pressure as we can get.

14:22.013 --> 14:23.513
What did you do to my brother?!

14:23.547 --> 14:26.116
The bullet was plugging a hole
in your brother's artery, Paul.

14:26.184 --> 14:28.218
I removed the bullet. The hole was exposed.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.020
I promised to save you. Now I've killed you.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.756
- My brother, my only brother!
- Paul, you need to be calm right now.

14:32.824 --> 14:34.658
We're gonna try and fix him right here.

14:34.725 --> 14:36.359
Okay, that artery is torn to shreds.

14:36.394 --> 14:38.995
But you know what? I do believe
that I can tie it up, though.

14:39.029 --> 14:41.898
- Cut off the blood supply to his hand?
- No, um...

14:41.965 --> 14:44.434
- [sighs] Paul, I'm gonna need your help.
- Okay.

14:44.502 --> 14:47.019
Okay, I'm not a nurse. I'm a doctor.
I can help you if you tell me what you want.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.930
Okay, doctor. Thank you.
The ulna will pick up the slack.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.556
Can you open a new suture kit
for me, please?

14:51.606 --> 14:52.005
Okay.

14:52.055 --> 14:54.643
- Paul, get some gloves on for me, please.
- They're right there.

14:54.711 --> 14:55.845
Right down there.

14:57.181 --> 14:59.266
Now, watch what I'm doing, buddy.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.449
Watch what I'm doing here.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.019
Selena and I are gonna tie
up the artery, and we're
gonna stop the bleeding.

15:03.086 --> 15:05.855
Gabriel, listen to me. I'm gonna
do this as quick as I can,

15:05.923 --> 15:08.557
but I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is gonna hurt a lot.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.025
Gabriel: - No! No!
- Hold your brother.

15:10.092 --> 15:12.060
Aah! [grunts]

15:12.094 --> 15:13.395
[screaming]

15:13.463 --> 15:15.864
Hold him, Paul.

15:15.898 --> 15:16.865
Stop!

15:16.933 --> 15:19.335
Stop! It is too much for him!

15:19.402 --> 15:21.370
Okay, you know what? This is
useless. We need painkillers.

15:21.404 --> 15:24.267
- Okay.
- What? Wait a minute. Where are you going?

15:24.317 --> 15:25.474
To go buy drugs.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.708
[door opens]

15:26.742 --> 15:29.477
Alex: It's called situs inversus totalis.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.380
Basically, all of your organs are backwards.

15:32.414 --> 15:35.483
- Backwards organs? Like how?
- Like a mirror image.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.785
Everything that we normally see
on the left...

15:37.820 --> 15:40.121
your heart, your stomach...
it's on the right.

15:40.493 --> 15:42.207
- My heart's over here?
- Yes.

15:42.257 --> 15:43.724
Hope Zion has never had
a patient like you, Glen.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.593
You are a medical marvel.

15:45.627 --> 15:48.028
Oh, this is crazy.

15:48.063 --> 15:50.365
I've always just been ordinary.

15:50.399 --> 15:52.633
Rita calls me her "common house sparrow."

15:52.668 --> 15:54.569
And now you're telling me that...

15:54.603 --> 15:57.004
Inside, you are not at all common.

15:58.142 --> 15:59.907
I'm the redheaded woodpecker.

15:59.941 --> 16:02.576
Alex, can you come have a look at this?

16:05.180 --> 16:08.282
How that got missed,
I will never understand.

16:08.316 --> 16:12.119
I was listening to his lungs, not his heart.

16:12.153 --> 16:15.155
Okay. Myocardial damage.

16:15.190 --> 16:17.457
Glen, it looks like
you've had a heart attack.

16:17.772 --> 16:18.661
A heart attack?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.626
Have you had any sharp pains
in your chest recently?

16:21.045 --> 16:23.530
- About 10 days ago or so?
- Uh...

16:24.350 --> 16:27.930
I-I was putting some jack pine
in my backyard. I...

16:27.980 --> 16:29.427
The birds like to nest in it.

16:29.477 --> 16:31.834
But I thought it was just overstraining.

16:31.909 --> 16:34.740
- No, that was probably a heart attack.
- A heart attack?

16:34.775 --> 16:36.322
So, we're gonna need to monitor your heart

16:36.372 --> 16:38.019
while we wait for your lungs to clear,

16:38.153 --> 16:39.444
- okay?
- Oh, boy.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.748
This is shaping up to be quite a day.

16:42.783 --> 16:45.751
Just embrace your inner redhead.

16:45.786 --> 16:47.220
[both chuckle]

16:47.254 --> 16:49.522
[Gavin sobbing]

16:54.031 --> 16:55.895
I'm an orange.

16:55.929 --> 16:58.497
[whimpers] Everybody wants to peel me.

16:58.532 --> 17:01.600
Jimmy: Gavin, you're not
an orange. You're a man.

17:01.635 --> 17:04.837
These are just the physiological
symptoms of the drug.

17:04.871 --> 17:07.638
- Drug?
- Dr. Murphy is extremely high on LSD.

17:07.673 --> 17:08.973
I'm an orange.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.344
We can't leave him like this.

17:12.412 --> 17:14.512
No, of course not.
You said he was depressed?

17:14.579 --> 17:15.613
This is an opportunity.

17:15.681 --> 17:17.316
You want to experiment on him?

17:17.383 --> 17:20.315
- No, I want to treat him.
- Uh...

17:20.483 --> 17:21.914
You offered me a job
because you wanted to be

17:21.964 --> 17:24.021
at the forefront
of the psychedelic renaissance.

17:25.022 --> 17:26.424
Okay.

17:26.492 --> 17:29.661
You C.C. me on your notes.

17:33.766 --> 17:35.500
All right, my man. You're coming out.

17:35.568 --> 17:37.769
- Come on. Come on.
- Ohh. Ohh.

17:37.837 --> 17:38.869
Watch your head.

17:39.782 --> 17:40.704
Lorazepam.

17:40.772 --> 17:42.340
Lorazepam's not strong enough.

17:42.407 --> 17:44.141
The lorazepam is for Paul,

17:44.176 --> 17:46.774
because we can't have
your retractor being jumpy.

17:47.365 --> 17:50.004
For Gabriel, I got you some ketamine.

17:50.054 --> 17:51.370
Joel: Wait a minute. You found ketamine?

17:51.420 --> 17:53.216
- Yep.
- Where did you find that?

17:53.266 --> 17:55.218
- Don't ask.
- Okay.

17:55.286 --> 17:56.386
Take that.

17:56.454 --> 17:57.688
Gabriel.

17:57.722 --> 18:00.491
Joel: Well, that should
seriously dull the pain.

18:00.558 --> 18:02.325
Let's give that a minute to work.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.895
And then we'll tie off this artery.

18:04.963 --> 18:06.897
[coughing]

18:06.931 --> 18:08.899
[monitors beeping rapidly]

18:08.967 --> 18:10.868
Alex: Okay, he's spitting up blood.

18:10.935 --> 18:12.502
Glen, you're gonna be okay.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.537
Flash pulmonary edema.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.938
You're gonna be okay, Glen.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.340
[continues coughing]

18:17.375 --> 18:20.343
Okay, he's getting worse.
Let's prep him for surgery.

18:20.378 --> 18:21.844
What happened?

18:21.912 --> 18:23.546
- Glen, we've got you. We got you.
- Glenny!

18:23.614 --> 18:25.315
- Don't try to... don't try to talk.
- Glenny?

18:25.349 --> 18:27.250
- Your husband needs surgery, okay?
- What?!

18:27.284 --> 18:30.219
The heart attack ruptured
a muscle in his heart. He
needs mitral valve repair.

18:30.286 --> 18:32.722
- No! No, no.
- Listen to me. You're gonna be fine, okay?

18:32.756 --> 18:34.223
Glenny, I'm here, honey.

18:34.257 --> 18:36.959
Rita, Dr. Bell's gonna take
very good care of your husband.

18:37.027 --> 18:38.595
If you can escort Rita to the waiting room,

18:38.645 --> 18:42.097
and we will come and find you
as soon as we're through, okay?

18:45.703 --> 18:46.801
Okay, your four hours are up.

18:46.869 --> 18:49.204
Consider yourself back on the board.

18:50.140 --> 18:51.206
[coughing]

18:51.884 --> 18:53.968
- So, you're left-handed.
- Yes.

18:54.018 --> 18:55.677
Which means you're used to
thinking backwards.

18:55.745 --> 18:57.746
Alex: Uh, you could say that.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.114
Okay, every tool in this hospital

18:59.149 --> 19:02.784
is for right-handed surgeons.
How do you do that?

19:02.818 --> 19:06.054
I just do the opposite of everything you do.

19:06.088 --> 19:07.088
Can I have a minute?

19:07.122 --> 19:08.557
Sure.

19:09.892 --> 19:12.694
Surgery with Dawn first day
back. That's gonna be...

19:12.728 --> 19:15.296
- fun.
- [chuckles]

19:15.330 --> 19:17.731
Hey, um, I-I-I wanted
to make reservations tonight

19:17.766 --> 19:19.267
for Scaramouche.

19:19.301 --> 19:22.570
Well, I don't know how long
this case will take, but, um...

19:22.604 --> 19:23.737
I love Scaramouche.

19:23.772 --> 19:25.173
Well, we don't have to go.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.108
Uh, we could go for a drink
or something like that.

19:27.142 --> 19:28.242
We don't have to go there.

Okay.

No. I feel sick.

I think I should sit this one out.

Okay. Go home.

What is love?

- What kind of love?
- Crazy love!

21:16.402 --> 21:18.246
It didn't work out! She was...

21:18.296 --> 21:20.333

Neuroscientists don't think
that there <i>is</i> a self.

Yeah, but we're not neuroscientists here.

21:30.037 --> 21:32.338
We're psychiatrists. The self
is our bread and butter,

21:32.373 --> 21:34.374
so what do you believe about the self?

21:34.441 --> 21:37.142
I believe that we all have
a one true self that we
can uncover and become.

32:39.138 --> 32:42.440
I'm having another strong feeling.

32:42.474 --> 32:44.041
Of anger?

32:45.777 --> 32:48.112
No.

32:48.180 --> 32:50.781
The other one.

32:50.849 --> 32:52.783
Love?

32:55.688 --> 32:57.755
[laughing softly]

33:01.526 --> 33:04.061
Alex: Okay, almost there.

33:04.129 --> 33:05.796
[monitors beeping]

33:05.864 --> 33:08.032
[sighs]

33:09.319 --> 33:10.514
Done.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.109
Good job.

33:13.821 --> 33:16.440
Baumann, put our patient into Trendelenburg.

33:19.944 --> 33:22.045
We are gonna shake the hell out of this guy.

33:22.113 --> 33:24.080
I'm sorry. Shake him?

33:24.148 --> 33:25.749
It's the only way to de-air his heart.

33:25.816 --> 33:27.784
We don't do it...
he could have a massive stroke.

33:27.818 --> 33:29.819
Vent on. Leave some blood behind.

33:29.887 --> 33:30.920
Consider it done.

33:30.988 --> 33:33.723
Baumann, sustained puff on the lungs.

33:33.758 --> 33:36.325
Ready?

33:36.393 --> 33:38.228
- Yeah.
- Shake.

33:39.463 --> 33:43.366
[laughing]

33:43.400 --> 33:46.002
Are you laughing, Alex?

33:46.036 --> 33:49.372
[continues laughing]

33:49.406 --> 33:51.774
Thank you, Dawn, really.

33:51.808 --> 33:54.710
Welcome back, Dr. Reid.

33:54.778 --> 33:57.280
- Now shake!

34:00.443 --> 34:03.109
The video would only be used
for educational purposes.

34:03.177 --> 34:04.611
Med students everywhere

34:04.645 --> 34:07.213
could benefit from seeing your surgery.

34:07.247 --> 34:08.614
I don't know.

34:10.271 --> 34:13.445
I would also like you to
consider being an organ donor.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.284
You could really help someone
with your condition.

34:17.027 --> 34:19.092
Just think about it, okay?

34:20.645 --> 34:22.389
Thanks, doc.

34:25.991 --> 34:28.235
I'm just happy to be alive.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.291
Your wife's happy, too.

34:32.512 --> 34:34.675
I don't know about this inversus thing.

34:34.725 --> 34:36.994
I-I don't want this attention.

34:37.862 --> 34:39.554
Please tell Dr. bell that.

34:39.719 --> 34:40.818
Sure.

34:42.469 --> 34:44.725
But, you know, this condition
makes you special.

34:44.775 --> 34:46.219
It's nothing to hide, Glen.

34:46.268 --> 34:49.597
You met Rita. <i>She's</i> the rare bird.

34:49.859 --> 34:51.844
She's the redheaded woodpecker,

34:51.893 --> 34:54.364
and I'm the common house sparrow.

34:55.149 --> 34:57.640
And that's what's worked for us
for 20 years.

34:58.310 --> 35:00.035
I don't want to mess that up.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.684
You're afraid things will change
because you're different?

35:02.946 --> 35:05.030
I like my life the way it is.

35:06.007 --> 35:08.777
What if <i>you</i> found out you were
completely different inside?

35:09.229 --> 35:11.142
Wouldn't <i>you</i> be scared
things would change?

35:11.176 --> 35:13.277
[sighs]

35:18.803 --> 35:21.485
Ah, yes. Lost and found,
the hidden gems you contain.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.320
Yeah.

35:24.262 --> 35:26.616
Deep down, you're really
enjoying wearing that shirt, aren't you?

35:26.943 --> 35:27.925
[laughs]

35:29.398 --> 35:31.008
You were kind of amazing today.

35:31.058 --> 35:32.696
I mean, you've got nerves of steel.

35:33.372 --> 35:34.432
Thank you.

35:34.482 --> 35:35.666
It's all in a day's work.

35:36.671 --> 35:38.501
And... [sighs]

35:38.762 --> 35:40.704
there's this. Um...

35:41.665 --> 35:43.651
A few days ago,
a patient of mine passed away,

35:43.701 --> 35:46.765
um, and I found this
among his personal effects.

35:46.874 --> 35:50.089
His... his name was... Roy Wilson?

35:51.748 --> 35:53.359
Roy died, huh?

35:53.896 --> 35:55.285
Yeah, he did, unfortunately.

35:55.625 --> 35:56.725
I liked him.

35:56.775 --> 35:58.047
Me, too.

36:02.348 --> 36:03.426
Um...

36:03.461 --> 36:05.861
[chuckles sadly]

36:06.701 --> 36:09.709
He was paying me back
money that he stole from me.

36:10.977 --> 36:12.810
It was kind of our thing.

36:15.879 --> 36:18.463
Can you give this to Paul and Gabriel?

36:19.315 --> 36:20.906
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

36:22.202 --> 36:23.416
And, listen, if you're ever interested

36:23.466 --> 36:25.477
in moonlighting in street medicine,

36:25.937 --> 36:28.271
my little clinic isn't going anywhere.

36:29.753 --> 36:31.517
Cool, I'll keep that in mind.

36:32.321 --> 36:33.472
Good.

36:34.001 --> 36:35.190
Thank you again.

36:37.227 --> 36:38.860
[sighs]

36:53.754 --> 36:54.976
Hey.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.978
You, uh, feeling better? I heard you, uh...

36:58.741 --> 37:00.542
had an experience.

37:01.043 --> 37:02.916
You're a little wavy, but I'm all right.

37:03.437 --> 37:06.080
That's... that's, uh... that's good.

37:06.130 --> 37:07.713
[chuckles]

37:09.337 --> 37:12.726
I had such a clear picture of my future.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.996
Maggie and I would have a baby,
probably get married,

37:16.031 --> 37:19.366
and then I would work here.
She would become a surgeon.

37:20.122 --> 37:21.558
And, uh [sighs]

37:21.608 --> 37:23.707
I feel like my fate's changed.

37:24.272 --> 37:25.257
And I saw it as the end.

37:25.307 --> 37:28.856
And then I had this realization that...

37:30.968 --> 37:32.672
when your fate changes...

37:32.999 --> 37:34.703
You change your fate.

37:37.851 --> 37:40.788
I might go somewhere else for a while.

37:41.834 --> 37:43.456
Where?

37:45.702 --> 37:47.188
I don't know.

37:49.776 --> 37:50.891
Oh.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.094
Well, hey, uh...

37:59.261 --> 38:02.136
good luck to you, man. I hope you...

38:03.186 --> 38:05.314
good luck to you. I hope you...

38:13.511 --> 38:14.520
Hey.

38:28.346 --> 38:30.616
This is the part of me that is for you.

38:35.485 --> 38:36.841
