00:30.914 --> 00:33.542
Astagnant low pressure trough

00:33.583 --> 00:37.041
will produce a fourth
straight day of rain.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.317
Hmm...

00:39.355 --> 00:40.845
Any of you guys
have that thing

00:40.890 --> 00:42.187
when you wake up
in the morning

00:42.225 --> 00:44.250
and see the rain and cry?

00:44.294 --> 00:47.855
Cheer up, Bill.
You'll be dead soon.

00:47.897 --> 00:50.365
Looks like the end
of days is upon us.

00:51.568 --> 00:53.195
See?

00:53.236 --> 00:54.635
Hold on.

00:54.671 --> 00:56.696
I think we're going from flood
watch to flood warning.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.937
Water levels at the upper Brazos
River are rising dangerously,

00:59.976 --> 01:03.207
causing flood warnings to be
issued for all low-lying areas,

01:03.246 --> 01:05.714
including Heimlich
and Travis Counties.

01:05.749 --> 01:08.013
Okay.

01:08.051 --> 01:09.450
Evacuation Plan A, everyone.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.954
I want an orderly,
efficient egress

01:11.988 --> 01:15.446
to the shelter
at Tom Landry Middle School.

01:17.927 --> 01:20.259
Out of my way, Boomhauer!

01:27.337 --> 01:32.331
Find land.
Plant this.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.570
I will meet you
at the rendezvous.

01:55.265 --> 01:58.826
Did Uncle Hank order a duck?

01:58.868 --> 02:01.359
Because there's one
in the mailbox.

02:04.507 --> 02:06.634
The flood's coming!

02:06.676 --> 02:09.235
Why are you all
just standing around!

02:09.279 --> 02:11.907
We've got to get to the shelter!

02:11.948 --> 02:13.074
We'll be safe there.

02:13.116 --> 02:15.277
Bobby, I need you
to calm down.

02:15.318 --> 02:17.218
You know I'm
Red Cross-certified

02:17.253 --> 02:18.584
to be the shelter leader

02:18.621 --> 02:20.589
and I promise you
everything is going to be okay.

02:20.623 --> 02:21.783
Now, go pack

02:21.825 --> 02:24.851
one suitcase and
no stuffed animals.

02:27.463 --> 02:30.159
Okay. One stuffed animal.
Not the bunny.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.839
They say one of the big problems
in a shelter

02:37.874 --> 02:40.035
is people often get
shelter shock,

02:40.076 --> 02:42.840
where they become
dependent and childlike.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.813
We don't have a lot of room
for error with Bobby.

02:44.848 --> 02:45.974
Don't worry, Hank.

02:46.015 --> 02:48.506
Bobby will not
go baby on my watch.

02:48.551 --> 02:50.485
I'll put pepper
on his thumbs just in case.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.784
Okay. Now I've got
to do a final sweep

02:52.822 --> 02:54.517
of the neighborhood
and then get the pets

02:54.557 --> 02:56.616
to a kennel on higher ground.

02:56.659 --> 02:58.058
I'm counting on you
and Luanne to wrap

02:58.094 --> 03:00.722
everything up
and get to the shelter.

03:02.198 --> 03:05.759
It's like God took our picture

03:05.802 --> 03:08.236
before he kills us.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.863
Go! Go! Go!

03:12.108 --> 03:13.803
Come on, Bill! Time to go!

03:13.843 --> 03:15.276
What in the hell?

03:15.311 --> 03:17.142
Dang it, as shelter leader,

03:17.180 --> 03:20.377
one of my duties is
to keep you from drowning.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.815
Maybe I'll float.

03:21.851 --> 03:24.149
Bill, get up and let Peggy
take you to the shelter.

03:24.187 --> 03:25.484
That's an order.

03:25.521 --> 03:27.989
If you say so.

03:28.024 --> 03:29.753
Now Peggy's
a little stressed out

03:29.792 --> 03:31.851
so don't stare at her
while she drives.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.927
Remember, Lady Bird.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.193
The other dogs will be looking

03:37.233 --> 03:38.291
to you for leadership.

03:38.334 --> 03:39.460
Be strong.

03:52.282 --> 03:55.149
Dang it,
I need to find higher ground.

04:09.065 --> 04:10.692
Look, Minh!

04:10.733 --> 04:13.031
Chaos already ruling.

04:13.069 --> 04:14.764
This like when city of
Luang Prabang fall,

04:14.804 --> 04:18.296
and we snagged sweet
diplomatic license plates.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.536
Oh! This our chance
to get prime real estate.

04:20.576 --> 04:21.702
But where?

04:25.481 --> 04:28.314
The heights! Run!

04:29.218 --> 04:31.209
Connie! Blankets!

04:33.690 --> 04:36.488
I always thought
I'd die in this gym.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.255
Bobby. Please stop
being so dramatic.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.785
Everything will be just fine.

04:40.830 --> 04:43.958
Oh, my God. I have three socks
and no underwear.

05:10.994 --> 05:12.461
Hello?

05:12.495 --> 05:15.089
Hello? Anybody here?

05:15.131 --> 05:17.156
Oh, my God.
The red phone.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.394
Dang it, Everett.

05:18.434 --> 05:19.628
Were you off
combing your mustache?

05:19.669 --> 05:20.658
I need a status report.

05:20.703 --> 05:22.193
Uh, Everett's not here.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.366
This is Hank Hill, Assistant
Manager, Strickland Propane.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.273
Everett's gone?
All right, listen.

05:27.310 --> 05:28.436
This is T. Beck Minzimyre

05:28.478 --> 05:29.911
with the Upper Brazos
River Authority.

05:29.946 --> 05:31.538
The storm's knocked out
all of our remote sensors,

05:31.581 --> 05:33.105
so I'm going
to need your help.

05:33.149 --> 05:35.845
Sir, I have mentally
rehearsed many emergency

05:35.885 --> 05:38.046
talk-through scenarios.
Go ahead.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.645
Okay. Check the monitors.

05:39.689 --> 05:41.748
Do you see any damage
to the face of the dam?

05:41.791 --> 05:44.351
Oh, God... I am seeing some
hairline cracks... yes.

05:44.394 --> 05:45.952
That's okay.
They're always there.

05:45.995 --> 05:47.758
But if they start
getting too big,

05:47.797 --> 05:49.594
you'll have to open
the floodgate.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.294
I could open it now,
just to be safe.

05:52.335 --> 05:54.166
No! I mean no.

05:54.203 --> 05:55.500
The rain could still let up.

05:55.538 --> 05:56.732
Open that floodgate now,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.434
and a dozen homes
and businesses are gone.

05:58.474 --> 05:59.634
Oh, okay, I won't
open the floodgate.

05:59.675 --> 06:01.404
Now don't get bullheaded
about it.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.708
Keep the gate closed too long
and the dam could break.

06:03.746 --> 06:05.737
All of South Arlen
would be destroyed.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.808
Okay so I'll open
the floodgate, but only if...

06:08.851 --> 06:10.318
Look, I've got a bass boat
stuck in a turbine

06:10.353 --> 06:11.843
at the LBJ dam.

06:11.888 --> 06:16.291
You're just going to have to use
your best judgment on this.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.894
Fresh cinnamon rolls,

06:24.934 --> 06:26.834
courtesy of the
Emergency Operation Center.

06:26.869 --> 06:28.200
We thought you might
be getting hungry.

06:28.237 --> 06:31.400
I could eat.

06:31.441 --> 06:35.741
Nice. You'll make sure
these get inside, right?

06:37.947 --> 06:40.415
Dad? Are we going
to be okay?

06:40.450 --> 06:43.317
Okay? Joseph,
how does being

06:43.352 --> 06:45.820
the best-looking kid
on earth sound to you?

06:45.855 --> 06:48.085
Because that's what
you're going to be

06:48.124 --> 06:51.582
when I'm done building an ark
for you, your mother and me.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.856
Hey! There's food!

06:58.901 --> 07:00.835
The Army guy's
got food for us!

07:00.870 --> 07:02.633
Mmm! That smells
delicious!

07:02.672 --> 07:04.640
Who's in charge here?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.972
I don't know.
I guess the Army guy.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.637
Actually, it's supposed
to be Hank, but he's not...

07:09.679 --> 07:11.340
Look, we've got a situation
at the East Shelter.

07:11.380 --> 07:13.143
So you're going to have to
hold the fort for a while.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.412
Here's your shelter kit.

07:15.451 --> 07:16.884
Here's your satellite phone.

07:16.919 --> 07:18.614
If you need to talk
to the emergency op center,

07:18.654 --> 07:21.748
just hit speed dial,
pound sign, one.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.589
Speed dial, pound sign, one.

07:24.627 --> 07:26.754
Hey! It worked!

07:26.796 --> 07:29.697
So until Uncle Hank gets here,

07:29.732 --> 07:33.668
Mr. Dauterive is going
to be our leader?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.830
God help us.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.739
Mom! Can I go play hide-
and-seek with Joseph?

07:38.774 --> 07:40.002
Hide-and-seek?

07:40.042 --> 07:42.442
Oh, my God, it's happening.

07:42.478 --> 07:43.843
Bobby! Grow up!

07:43.880 --> 07:45.404
Now here's the
school's master key.

07:45.448 --> 07:47.939
Go to the teacher's lounge,
have some coffee,

07:47.984 --> 07:49.451
and bitch about your friends.

07:49.485 --> 07:52.784
Okay.

07:54.524 --> 07:55.923
Continued heavy rain

07:55.958 --> 07:57.585
with little chance of clearing
through the evening.

07:57.627 --> 08:00.118
Good Lord,
are the cracks getting bigger?

08:05.635 --> 08:08.934
<i>Open the floodgate and a dozen
homes and businesses are gone.</i>

08:08.971 --> 08:11.735
<i>Or the dam breaks and all of
South Arlen will be destroyed.</i>

08:11.774 --> 08:13.264
Oh, God. What do I do?

08:13.309 --> 08:16.403
I don't know!
I don't know!

08:24.353 --> 08:25.843
Oh, God.

08:43.405 --> 08:44.964
Cherry?

08:45.007 --> 08:46.338
I love cherry.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.774
Good call, Bill.

09:00.690 --> 09:02.715
Bill! Hank still
isn't here.

09:02.758 --> 09:03.884
Where is he?

09:03.926 --> 09:06.258
I think Bobby's
got shelter shock.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.455
He's reverting.

09:07.496 --> 09:08.724
Where is Hank?

09:08.764 --> 09:11.665
Now, now, Peggy, I'm sure
Hank is fine.

09:11.701 --> 09:12.668
You are?

09:12.702 --> 09:13.896
Yes, I am.

09:13.936 --> 09:16.928
Oh, so everything's
going to be okay?

09:16.973 --> 09:17.962
That's right.

09:18.007 --> 09:19.668
Now why don't you lay
down in bed

09:19.709 --> 09:22.337
and I'll get you a nice,
hot bowl of chicken soup.

09:22.378 --> 09:23.436
How does that sound?

09:23.479 --> 09:26.004
Well, that does sound nice.

09:26.048 --> 09:27.743
I'll need a spoon.

09:29.685 --> 09:31.084
It's also a fork

09:31.120 --> 09:33.054
for those nice bits of chicken.

09:40.963 --> 09:43.830
Shelter leader Dauterive here.

09:43.866 --> 09:45.163
Mm-hmm.

09:45.201 --> 09:46.168
I see.

09:46.202 --> 09:47.430
People,

09:47.470 --> 09:50.268
I've just been informed
that a wall of water

09:50.306 --> 09:53.366
from Tut Rampy Dam has destroyed
several homes

09:53.409 --> 09:54.774
on River Oaks Drive,

09:54.810 --> 09:57.540
and may have reached
the new outlet mall.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.406
We live on River Oaks!

10:00.449 --> 10:03.350
My father-in-law mall-walks
at that mall.

10:05.221 --> 10:06.813
Hank, you're alive!

10:09.492 --> 10:11.722
Did everyone who lives
below the dam get here okay?

10:11.761 --> 10:12.785
Don't worry, Hank.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.056
They're all safe.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.120
I saw to that.

10:15.164 --> 10:18.622
Oh, thank God.
You saw to that?

10:18.668 --> 10:20.795
Yup. I'm the shelter leader.

10:20.836 --> 10:22.201
But I'm supposed...

10:22.238 --> 10:23.535
I got the phone.

10:23.572 --> 10:26.006
So they made you the leader?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.806
Is everyone taking turns, or...

10:28.844 --> 10:31.438
Yeah, well, we'll get this
all straightened out.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.449
I'm just glad I made it out
of there, it was horrible.

10:34.483 --> 10:36.917
But at least I was able
to save South Arlen.

10:36.952 --> 10:37.976
How'd you do that?

10:38.020 --> 10:39.419
Well, I opened the floodgate

10:39.455 --> 10:41.184
to relieve the pressure
on the dam.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.623
Wait, you opened
the floodgate?

10:43.659 --> 10:46.457
He's the Arlen Flooder.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.520
You heartless bastard!

10:48.564 --> 10:50.054
All right, people, easy!

10:50.099 --> 10:52.363
I'm sure Hank has a good
explanation

10:52.401 --> 10:54.995
for destroying your homes
and outlet mall.

10:56.605 --> 11:00.097
Well, I was authorized by
T. Beck Minzemeyer to...

11:00.142 --> 11:01.268
You made that name up.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.834
No. The phone was ringing.

11:02.878 --> 11:04.345
The red phone.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.610
Oh, and who was on the other
end, Commissioner Gordon?

11:06.649 --> 11:09.516
No, listen, I was
watching the cracks.

11:09.552 --> 11:11.952
They went from hairline cracks,

11:11.987 --> 11:14.046
to very thick hairline cracks.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.081
Hank, I went to bat for you.

11:16.125 --> 11:19.288
An excuse like that
makes us both look bad.

11:21.364 --> 11:23.798
Hey, let's go
to the girls' locker room

11:23.833 --> 11:26.324
and stand where
naked girls have stood.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.768
Okay.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.663
Wait.

11:30.706 --> 11:33.732
I'm not so sure about my
yearbook photo.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.971
I think in ten or 15 years

11:36.011 --> 11:39.208
I might regret
wearing that headband.

11:39.248 --> 11:41.876
Or maybe I won't. Come on.

11:43.285 --> 11:46.152
I already told you:
The dam had cracks.

11:46.188 --> 11:48.156
Every dam has cracks, stupid.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.555
You tell him, Everett.

11:49.592 --> 11:51.492
Everett's been working at
that dam for 20 years

11:51.527 --> 11:52.824
and we never lost a single home

11:52.862 --> 11:54.887
on his watch.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.329
Everett?

11:56.365 --> 11:59.129
Wait a minute, you're the guy
who abandoned his post.

11:59.168 --> 12:01.068
Hey, don't make this
about Everett.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.901
Now, come on, people.

12:03.939 --> 12:07.136
I've known Hank Hill almost all
my life, and if he was afraid...

12:07.176 --> 12:08.336
I was not afraid.

12:08.377 --> 12:10.038
I had a difficult
decision to make,

12:10.079 --> 12:12.138
but I weighed the choices
and I acted!

12:12.181 --> 12:13.648
In other words...

12:14.884 --> 12:16.476
Hey, you take that noise back!

12:16.519 --> 12:18.316
You don't know anything
about this

12:18.354 --> 12:19.844
because you left your post.

12:19.889 --> 12:22.119
Yeah, well, maybe if I'd stayed
at my post,

12:22.158 --> 12:23.819
we'd still have an outlet mall.

12:23.859 --> 12:26.521
Look, in my training
to be the shelter leader...

12:26.562 --> 12:27.995
Bill's the shelter leader!

12:28.030 --> 12:29.895
Mm-hmm.

12:36.372 --> 12:40.570
Ready? I'm about to make love
to the camera.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.380
Man, I never noticed
how much you blink.

12:47.416 --> 12:52.820
Ah... most desirable
address in all of gym is ours.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.983
Yes, people admire us.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.084
But how do we make them fear us?

13:00.095 --> 13:03.826
The man who controls the phone
controls the shelter.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.891
Control the man who
controls the phone, Kahn.

13:05.935 --> 13:06.902
Understood.

13:06.936 --> 13:08.904
I see... mm-hmm...

13:08.938 --> 13:10.599
beef stroganoff.

13:10.639 --> 13:12.937
I'll inform my people.

13:12.975 --> 13:17.207
Isn't that like the president
reading a school lunch menu?

13:17.246 --> 13:21.307
Surely a man in your position
has more global concerns.

13:21.350 --> 13:24.410
Well, I could
use someone to...

13:24.453 --> 13:26.250
I'll get bullhorn!

13:28.491 --> 13:30.789
Bill... In charge?

13:30.826 --> 13:32.589
I mean... Bill?

13:32.628 --> 13:34.960
Hank, do you have
any loose floorboards

13:34.997 --> 13:37.397
I could scavenge
for my Ark's gangplank?

13:37.433 --> 13:40.402
Joseph's been looking
a little mutinous lately.

13:40.436 --> 13:42.370
Dale, put that stuff back.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.304
You're not the boss of me.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.366
Bill's the boss of me,
and he says my plan

13:47.409 --> 13:49.036
is bold and innovative.

13:57.553 --> 14:00.852
Dang it, someone's got to snap
this place into shape.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.558
These are for emergencies.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.722
The electricity could go off
at any moment.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.232
Hey, why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.598
Okay.

14:12.635 --> 14:13.761
We just had lunch.

14:13.802 --> 14:15.736
We're supposed to be rationing
our food

14:15.771 --> 14:17.568
in case supplies
get interrupted.

14:26.549 --> 14:29.313
Dang it, Bill, you can't be
monkeying around

14:29.351 --> 14:30.978
with the emergency phone.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.079
Suppose the EOC is trying
to get through

14:33.122 --> 14:34.589
with important information?

14:34.623 --> 14:36.215
I got to tell you, Hank,

14:36.258 --> 14:39.159
those guys think everything's
an emergency.

14:39.194 --> 14:41.458
Bill, give me the phone.

14:41.497 --> 14:43.692
You can keep the hat
and the road flares,

14:43.732 --> 14:46.292
but you can't be trusted
with our only lifeline

14:46.335 --> 14:47.495
to the outside world.

14:52.708 --> 14:53.675
Let go, Hank. Stop it.

14:53.709 --> 14:55.870
You're creating a panic.

14:55.911 --> 14:57.071
Kahn!

14:57.112 --> 14:58.841
Kahn, get your men.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.075
Kahn has men?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.016
Take Hank to the cage.

15:04.053 --> 15:05.645
There's a cage?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.724
Come on.

15:10.759 --> 15:11.885
You can't do this.

15:11.927 --> 15:13.690
Let go of me!

15:13.729 --> 15:15.219
Hey!

15:15.264 --> 15:17.824
Parents, tell your children
they can sleep soundly tonight.

15:17.866 --> 15:20.300
Shelter leader Dauterive
has locked up

15:20.336 --> 15:21.598
the Arlen Flooder!

15:29.678 --> 15:32.374
Come on, Hill,
got to stay in shape.

15:32.414 --> 15:34.405
Give me three more good ones.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.576
I swear.

15:35.618 --> 15:36.846
I don't know how
all that toilet paper

15:36.885 --> 15:37.852
got under my cot!

15:39.254 --> 15:41.688
Got dang it, Bill,
what's gotten into you?

15:41.724 --> 15:42.782
You are out of control.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.850
Strong leaders
always make enemies

15:44.893 --> 15:47.225
and that's why
they make strong cages.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.163
Cage was my idea.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.192
Ironic, huh?

15:54.236 --> 15:57.694
Okay, lazy bones,
time for breakfast!

15:59.508 --> 16:00.941
Where's Hank?

16:00.976 --> 16:02.603
Uh, Hank went with Kahn

16:02.645 --> 16:04.977
to work up a skit
about hygiene.

16:05.014 --> 16:07.915
Hmm.
That sounds like Hank.

16:10.853 --> 16:12.377
Your hillbilly pal

16:12.421 --> 16:15.356
is drunk on power for once, instead
of corn squeezin's.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.189
I should have taken
control the minute I walked in here.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.195
Oh, so you have eye

16:20.229 --> 16:22.163
on top job.

16:22.197 --> 16:23.755
No! But I mean,
look at us.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.426
Don't worry.
I support coup.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.458
And then maybe you'll give me
five minutes alone

16:27.503 --> 16:28.595
with sticky bun cart.

16:28.637 --> 16:30.969
Look, we need
to get out of here, Kahn.

16:31.006 --> 16:31.973
Give me a hand.

16:34.276 --> 16:36.506
So, Nancy,
what do you think of my ark?

16:36.545 --> 16:38.012
Pretty yar, huh?

16:38.047 --> 16:39.412
Oh, it's real yar, shug.

16:39.448 --> 16:42.008
Now climb on down
and get something to eat.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.014
Okay, attention, people.

16:48.057 --> 16:51.823
It seems that we're all out
of cinnamon sticky buns...

16:52.895 --> 16:54.192
But the children love them.

16:54.229 --> 16:56.663
You said we'd never run out
of cinnamon sticky buns.

16:56.699 --> 17:00.362
Well, uh, we had plenty, but...
Hank ate 'em!

17:01.670 --> 17:02.659
That's right.

17:02.705 --> 17:04.104
But don't worry.

17:04.138 --> 17:06.039
I have procured enough
Carnation Instant Breakfast

17:06.075 --> 17:07.064
for everyone.

17:16.251 --> 17:17.980
Go, you mighty behemoth!

17:39.208 --> 17:40.766
What are you doing?!

17:40.809 --> 17:43.744
You can't just stick pictures
of yourselves in the yearbook!

17:43.779 --> 17:46.748
Take it up
with the class president.

17:46.782 --> 17:49.410
Do you know how much trouble
you could get into

17:49.451 --> 17:52.420
for submitting fraudulent clubs
and activities pages?

17:52.454 --> 17:53.443
Uh, no.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.286
But these yearbooks
won't come out

17:55.324 --> 17:57.155
until we already
graduate, right?

18:00.362 --> 18:01.795
I call prom queen!

18:08.070 --> 18:09.867
That's right,

18:09.905 --> 18:10.872
hayseeds.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.339
Keep watching your food.

18:12.374 --> 18:14.569
You don't want
to eat your fingers.

18:14.610 --> 18:15.907
Shut up, Kahn.

18:15.944 --> 18:17.138
Let's get out of here.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.678
Thanks for the tip, Kahn.

18:25.721 --> 18:26.915
What?!

18:26.955 --> 18:29.185
You show terrible
judgment in trusting me.

18:29.224 --> 18:30.782
How can I follow you?

18:30.826 --> 18:32.225
Can I have my
bullhorn back now?

18:32.261 --> 18:35.719
Sure. The batteries are dead,
but you can wave it around.

18:37.132 --> 18:39.828
Hank, Hank, Hank,
what am I going to do with you?

18:39.868 --> 18:42.564
I may just have
to break out the dodge balls

18:42.604 --> 18:44.504
and let the crowd have at you.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.132
Will you listen
to yourself, Bill?

18:46.175 --> 18:48.735
You sound like some kind
of crazed gym teacher.

18:48.777 --> 18:50.972
Is that the kind
of leader you want to be?

18:51.013 --> 18:52.776
I didn't seek the hard hat.

18:52.815 --> 18:54.806
The hard hat
was thrust upon me!

18:54.850 --> 18:56.340
Fair enough, but dang it,

18:56.385 --> 18:58.410
this rain is gonna
stop sometime,

18:58.453 --> 19:00.045
and when it does...

19:05.394 --> 19:08.056
Aw, Bill, did it already stop?

19:08.096 --> 19:10.257
It's still muggy out.

19:10.299 --> 19:11.561
Bill, you got lucky.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.693
The flood ended
before we used up

19:13.735 --> 19:15.600
all our food and toilet paper,

19:15.637 --> 19:17.730
but now it's time
to do your job.

19:17.773 --> 19:18.853
The goal of a shelter leader

19:18.874 --> 19:20.239
is to get these people

19:20.275 --> 19:22.266
out of the shelter
and back to their real lives.

19:22.311 --> 19:23.869
But my real life sucks.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.473
Bill, you've done a
good job of keeping people happy...

19:27.516 --> 19:29.711
mostly by turning
them against me...

19:29.751 --> 19:32.345
but this is your chance
to go out on top.

19:32.387 --> 19:35.356
You could be
like Ted Williams.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.357
Heck, people are
still fighting

19:36.391 --> 19:38.382
over his frozen head.

19:42.831 --> 19:45.891
Everyone, I have
an announcement.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.392
But first, I'd like to say
that it's been an honor

19:49.438 --> 19:50.700
leading all of you.

19:50.739 --> 19:52.604
We love you!

19:54.042 --> 19:55.066
When I first...

20:02.417 --> 20:05.113
The flood is over!

20:10.659 --> 20:13.628
Wow, the Armageddon
is beautiful.

20:13.662 --> 20:15.220
It smells so fresh.

20:15.264 --> 20:16.128
Is it safe?

20:16.164 --> 20:17.358
What about upriver?

20:17.399 --> 20:19.390
You can all go home.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.466
Oh, Mr. Trunkers,
there you are.

20:24.506 --> 20:25.530
Let's go!

20:29.544 --> 20:31.375
His name is Peanuts.

20:36.251 --> 20:38.549
They don't need me anymore.

20:38.587 --> 20:41.454
Well, that means
you did your job, Bill.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.755
Go on, C.J.,
ask the nice man.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.091
Could you come
talk to my scout troop?

20:47.129 --> 20:50.724
The topic is "What it takes
to be a good leader."

20:53.302 --> 20:55.293
Oh, and is this yours?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.100
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

20:57.139 --> 20:59.198
Flooder!

21:05.080 --> 21:07.139
It's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.047
Yep, it is.

21:09.084 --> 21:12.645
You should've seen
the rainbow yesterday.

21:12.688 --> 21:18.352
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>
