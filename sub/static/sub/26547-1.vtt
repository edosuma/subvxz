01:20.789 --> 01:22.290

01:22.332 --> 01:23.625
I can't remember the lasttime you did a field test.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.502
Have you ever done a field test?

01:25.543 --> 01:26.961
- Good morning, Ben.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.129
Oh, those are fantastic.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.380
I'm gonna need a newvendor report on those

01:36.054 --> 01:37.347
Morning, Phil.- Hey!

01:37.388 --> 01:38.723
- I like to keep up with what'shappening with new vendors.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.142
It's all part ofbeing a good VP.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.227
- But you're not a VP.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.561
- Well, not yet.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.816
- You're a director,just like me.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.567
- But I have plans.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.319
- There still needsto be a job opening.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.737
- You haven't heard.- Heard what?

01:52.779 --> 01:53.738
- Hey Alex!

01:53.780 --> 01:55.198

01:59.452 --> 02:01.037
but grab a helmet and join me.

02:01.079 --> 02:01.996
It'll be fun!

02:02.997 --> 02:05.083
- Oh, I have a 9:30call with Oslo.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.168
We're onboarding anew ski vendor, so.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.503
- That's fantastic news!

02:08.503 --> 02:11.214
- It is fantastic news,especially since I just found a

02:11.256 --> 02:13.258
place where we candistribute our new gear.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.175
- You did?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.053
- Where?

02:17.095 --> 02:18.221
- Hackett, Arizona.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.431
Former tire factory,perfect for the

02:20.473 --> 02:22.141
distribution center you wanted.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.768
- What about itsenvironmental compliance?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.186
- They're already up on all the

02:25.186 --> 02:26.729
Green Building CouncilStandards, with just the bare

02:26.771 --> 02:29.607
minimum for us to get itin shape for our usage.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.860
- Well, all righty.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.987
Grab a helmet Ben,and tell me more.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.113
- On my way!

02:35.155 --> 02:36.406
Told you I had plans.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.452
(Roger chuckles)

02:43.830 --> 02:45.582
- It's my fault, Ishould've just gone up

02:45.623 --> 02:46.916
when Roger asked me to.

02:46.958 --> 02:47.876
- Why didn't you?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.502
- You know I don't rock climb.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.045
Kayak...

02:51.045 --> 02:51.880
Or ski...

02:51.921 --> 02:52.881
Camp.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.340
- And yet?- And yet,

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
how do you say no toa job at the biggest

02:55.884 --> 02:58.177
outdoor recreationalgoods retailer?

02:58.219 --> 03:00.013
- You don't.- Exactly.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.723
I mean, the company'sreputation is the reason why

03:01.764 --> 03:03.725
I agreed to be recruited.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.979
Even if outdoorsy isn'texactly my natural orientation.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.065
- Executive Assistantgrapevine says

03:11.065 --> 03:13.568
Tom Davis is staying inSpain after his honeymoon,

03:13.568 --> 03:15.486
which means--- A VP spot is opening up.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.113
- Mm-hmm.- Ben's gonna go hard

03:17.155 --> 03:19.490
for that spot, andhe has seniority.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.575
- Well, he may have only been at

03:20.575 --> 03:22.035
Great Frontiers for a year--

03:22.076 --> 03:24.579
- And a half--- But, Roger respects you.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.415
Maybe that's why Roger wantsto talk with you later.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.500
- I hadn't thought about that.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.835
But Ben's alreadygot a lead on Roger's

03:30.877 --> 03:33.046
new distribution center, so--- So?

03:33.087 --> 03:35.298
Find something elseto take the lead on.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.767
(upbeat music)

03:47.602 --> 03:50.855
(horses whinnying)

03:55.693 --> 03:58.029
(laughing)

04:00.365 --> 04:03.117
(loud hammering)

04:09.582 --> 04:10.667
- All right.

04:16.965 --> 04:17.966
All right.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.012
Young man, a little mementofrom your stay with us.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.514
Thank you so much.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.643
All right, all for you.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.519
High five.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.813
Five!

04:31.813 --> 04:33.815
All right.- Thank you so much, Josh.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.525
- You're welcome.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.362
Michael!- Hey, how are you?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.655
- Good to have you back.- Yeah, great to be back.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.656
- How are you?- Good, good, good.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.991
- Good.- Yeah, I left the office

04:43.032 --> 04:44.784
and went straightto Fresno Airport.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.203
You know I'm not gonnamiss the Centennial, now.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.288
- Would not have beenthe same without you.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.164
Checked in?- No, no.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.082
I'm gonna go do it right now.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.333
- Get checked in, come meet me.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.086
- Okay, see you later.- All right, see you.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.092
- There you go.- Okay.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.929
- Hi, hello, how are you?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.683
Is that Serena Monroe'scar I saw leaving?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.518
- It was.- It was, okay.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.354
Did she make us an offer?- She did.

05:13.396 --> 05:17.191
- Good, I'll file it away inmy special filing cabinet.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.991
- That is why I do the filing.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.953
(sighs) It's a good offer, Josh.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.581
- A good offer in theory.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.416
I don't need to read thatcontract from that ranch

05:33.458 --> 05:35.460
to know that they just wannalevel this place for pasture.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.504
- And if the banks cared aboutkeeping this place intact,

05:38.546 --> 05:40.381
we wouldn't be where we are.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.719
But numbers with deadlinesare all banks care about.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.888
And we need tostart caring, too,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.514
while we still havea say in the matter,

05:48.556 --> 05:50.725
which we won't bythe end of the month.

05:50.725 --> 05:54.145
- Centennial is in a week.- I know.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.439
And Serena says shewants an answer by then.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.067
She knows exactly when thebanks will come calling.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.027
- And Dad would be really upset.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.030
If he knew we were thinkingabout selling this place.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.907
- But Dad didn'twanna turn Harmony

06:05.907 --> 06:08.534
into a dude ranch, either.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.577
But we did.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.453
We had to.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.331
And it almost worked.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.752
- Almost.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.089
(soft music)

06:24.759 --> 06:26.886
- Hi, Grace said I should just--

06:26.928 --> 06:28.429
- Yes, here.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.347
Try this.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.226
Potential vendor.- Okay.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.063
Oh.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.028
What is it supposed to be?- In theory,

06:44.070 --> 06:45.613
freeze-dried lasagna.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.782
- Takes like oatmeal.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.951
- I'll put that down as a pass.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.328
But that is not why you're here.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.624
I think...

06:56.666 --> 06:58.584
I think a change is in order.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.460
- Regarding?

07:00.211 --> 07:02.004
- The Great Frontiers retreat.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
- Retreat?- Retreat.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.219
As you know, every yearwe pick someplace new.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.762
Maui, Yosemite, Grand Cayman.

07:09.804 --> 07:10.847
That was nice.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.516
But I have a new idea.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.937
Harmony Dude Ranchin North Dakota.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.398
- Dude?- Ranch.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.526
I've always had a softspot for the Old West.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.819
This one's new on the market.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.737
700 acres, owned bya brother and sister,

07:26.779 --> 07:28.698
Josh and Taylor Ketchum.- Hold on,

07:28.739 --> 07:31.159
you're thinking about buying?- I am.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.326
That's the new idea.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.829
- Only for a retreat.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.123
- You have another suggestion?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.875
- Well, it's justcompany-wide we only

07:38.916 --> 07:40.960
have a few retreats every year.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.878
- That's true.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.132
- Wait, what about, what ifwe used it as something else

07:46.174 --> 07:47.091
for the rest of the time?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.593
Like an employeetraining center.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.678
I mean, we're growingout of the one in Denver.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.846
- I like where you're going.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.806
- I mean, we could evendo our bootcamps there.

07:53.848 --> 07:54.724
- Yes.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.017
Oh, that's perfect!

07:56.809 --> 07:58.311
Why don't you goand scout the place

07:58.352 --> 07:59.937
and see if it's up toGreat Frontiers standards?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.939
- You want me to scout--- I know, I know.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.524
Normally Ben goes, but he's off

08:03.566 --> 08:05.693
to Arizona scouting thepotential distribution center.

08:05.693 --> 08:06.986
- Right, it's just--- Should only

08:07.028 --> 08:08.321
take a couple of days.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.822
But it has to be ASAP.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.949
My agent tells me there'sanother offer on the place.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.201
- But I--- Look,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.119
if Harmony isn'tright we'll pass.

08:16.329 --> 08:21.000
By then, Ben should be backand he can take it from here.

08:21.042 --> 08:21.918
What do you say?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.590
(upbeat music)

08:44.065 --> 08:46.234
- Reception's a bitspotty out here.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.822
Harmony Ranch is just up ahead.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.949
- Thank you.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.514
- Reins.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.059
Gotta keep 'em closer to you.- Like that?

09:47.962 --> 09:50.965
(horses whinnying)

09:51.966 --> 09:55.094
(camera shuttering)

10:05.187 --> 10:08.107
(horse snuffling)

10:24.665 --> 10:27.752
(guests chattering)

10:29.670 --> 10:32.965
- Welcome to Harmony!- Hi, I'm a late arrival.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.009
- Ms. McKenna fromGreat Frontiers?

10:35.051 --> 10:36.052
- Yes.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.261
Please, call me Alex.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.930
You must be one of the Ketchums.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.182
- Sure am.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.016
Taylor Ketchum,nice to meet you.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.100
- Nice to meet you.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.353
This place is amazing.- Thanks.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.855
I grew up here so it's kindahard to have perspective.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.190
- I know exactly what you mean.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.566
I grew up in suburban Ohio.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.526
I didn't realize howbeautiful it was until I left.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.695
- Oh, well I'll have totake your word for it.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.364
The leaving andcoming back part.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.573
I've never been to Ohio.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.116
I mean, I've neverbeen anywhere, really.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.202
I would like to go places.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.620
(laughing)

11:02.662 --> 11:04.538
Okay, let's get you situated.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.457
- Okay.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.085
(upbeat music)

11:10.169 --> 11:11.837
- All right.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.713
Thanks.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.715
- Hey, Josh.

11:15.966 --> 11:20.471
I kinda overslept and missedthe lasso lesson this morning.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.098
- How long you been coming here?

11:22.139 --> 11:23.933
- I don't know, five years, why?

11:23.974 --> 11:26.185
- You should know it's alariat, it's not a lasso.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.479
- Right, right.- So.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.149
- How 'bout now?- Yeah, now's fine.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.234
Let's go.- Okay.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.404
- I can't believe you guysare selling the ranch.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.364
It seems so popular.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.990
- Yeah, this week, sure.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.993
But that's because of ourCentennial celebration.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.578
A lot of our regularguests are back,

11:44.578 --> 11:45.955
so we're busier than usual.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.873
But catch us most any other time

11:47.915 --> 11:51.168
and there are halfas many folks here.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.045
- So beautiful.- Thanks,

11:53.087 --> 11:56.173
but we got a late start inthe dude ranch business.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.176
We were still a working ranchonly until six years ago.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.511
- What made you change it?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.014
- Our dad passed away.- Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.433
- Thank you.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.436
Dad thought dude rancheswere basically resorts.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.104
And he wasn't wrong.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.315
But maybe if we'd gonethat route earlier.

12:16.652 --> 12:20.489
I know you're just taking alook around for your boss,

12:20.531 --> 12:23.451
but if you don't mind,I'd appreciate it if you'd

12:23.451 --> 12:26.120
keep the fact we're sellingto yourself, at this point.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.831
I don't wanna upsetany longtime guests.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.416
- My lips are sealed.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.918
- Wow, is this my cabin?- It is.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.547
Well, yours and Jill's.- Jill?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
(laughing)

12:38.799 --> 12:40.009
- Jill Tanner from Modesto.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.137
Nice to meet you, Alex.- And you are my--

12:43.179 --> 12:45.306
- Cabinmate for a couple days.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.390
- Oh.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.683
I just thought that--- Your reservation

12:47.725 --> 12:49.810
came so last secondthat we had to bunk up.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.854
Mr. Hilton's officesaid it would be okay

12:51.896 --> 12:53.939
since you were only gonna behere 'til day after tomorrow.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.358
- That is true.- And the only other option

12:56.400 --> 12:58.068
was the ranch hand bunk house.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.738
- Oh, well, we'll befine, this is great.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.864
- Okay.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.157
I have to head backto the front desk,

13:03.282 --> 13:05.075
and I have to start preppingthe coals for dinner.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.077
- Taylor's barbecue is the best.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.788
- And my pumpkincheesecake's even better.

13:08.829 --> 13:09.830
- Mm, accurate.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.083
Don't fret.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.002
I promise, I'm great at sharing.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.296
You can ask my ex-husband.- Oh.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.005
- Gary.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.089
It's all amicable.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.382
I'm the kinda personwho always wanted

13:20.424 --> 13:21.842
to go outdoors andfind adventures,

13:21.842 --> 13:23.302
and he's more ofa watch adventures

13:23.344 --> 13:24.678
from a distance kind of guy.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.138
So now I can come toplaces like Harmony

13:26.180 --> 13:28.349
for a fresh startand meet new people.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.350
Like you.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.684
Look at me, oversharing.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.229
(laughing)- Okay then.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.022
- Come on, let meshow you your room.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.565
- Ooh, wait, okay.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.110
(lasso whipping)

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279
- All right?- Okay.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.697
I think.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.865
- Now, you got this.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.977
(cat meowing)

14:13.018 --> 14:18.107
- There you go.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.153
- And then when youget really good,

14:23.195 --> 14:25.072
you can start doing this stuff.

14:26.198 --> 14:26.949
- [Alex] What?

14:26.991 --> 14:27.825
(Alex squealing)

14:27.866 --> 14:30.452
- Whoa, Josh.- I am so sorry.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.204
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.915
- Most guys justask for my number.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.961
- You all right?- Yeah.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.424
This is what we calla funny story one day.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.633
(laughing)

14:44.675 --> 14:45.759
- Let's start over.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.595
Josh Ketchum,co-owner of Harmony.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.888
- Alex McKenna.- Nice to meet you.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.433
This is my guest.- Nice to meet you.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.268
- Nice to meet you.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.311
- McKenna, I don't--

14:55.352 --> 14:56.604
- I just got here.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.105
Late arrival.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.107
- Yeah, no, I get all the names,

15:00.149 --> 15:02.860
I just don't recognize that one.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.736
- Oh.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.239
- Welcome.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.825
- Don't get mad.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.201
- Well, that's practically aguarantee he's gonna get mad.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.161
- Why am I getting mad?

15:12.202 --> 15:15.039
- See?- Nothing's official.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.625
- Are you a lawyer or something?

15:17.666 --> 15:18.626
- Definitely not.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.003
- Okay, then whatbrings you here?

15:21.045 --> 15:24.006
- It's the ranch.- To scout and possibly buy.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.091
- Are you from Monroe?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.468
Because Monroe knows whatthis property looks like.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.886
- I'm sorry, what's Monroe?

15:28.927 --> 15:31.138
- Alex is from Great Frontiers.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.432
- I don't know that ranch.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.808
- No, it's not a ranch.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.644
We're the leading onlineretailers of sportswear,

15:36.644 --> 15:39.104
camping gear,mountaineering equipment.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.189
Really never heard of us?

15:40.314 --> 15:42.816
- Do you sell cowboy boots?- Actually, no.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.277
- Then no.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.363
So you'll understand thatI don't understand why

15:47.404 --> 15:48.822
you'd want to buy this place.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.240
- I'm just here to scout.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.452
And possibly buy for a companyretreat and training center.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.333
- A retreat and training center.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.835
I wish we had a contract.- You do?

16:01.877 --> 16:04.630
- Yes, I'd file itin my special file.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.385
Ms. McKenna, I don'twanna sell this ranch.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.469
I especially don't wanna sell it

16:10.511 --> 16:12.304
to some corporateraider who doesn't have

16:12.346 --> 16:14.348
enough sense to wearthe proper boots.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.975
- These are excellent boots.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.476
- They're not for riding.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.811
That's what we do here.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.606
Very sorry to waste your time.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.903
- I apologize.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.906
My brother can bea little stubborn.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.618
- Well, as it happens,that makes two of us.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.751
(upbeat music)

16:44.003 --> 16:45.713
(phone ringing)

16:45.754 --> 16:47.464
- Alex McKenna's office.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.882
- [Alex] Hello, Carla?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
Carla?- Alex?

16:50.467 --> 16:51.885
- Carla, hi.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.388
Oh, so glad I got through.- Where are you right now?

16:54.430 --> 16:58.308
- I am standing undera tree, next to a pond.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.810
The guests call it Two Bar Tree.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.896
It's like the only place hereyou can get any cell service.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.482
I just emailed you somepictures of the ranch.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.278
- [Carla] Oh, it's pretty.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.405
- It's even prettier in person.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.449
Roger is gonna love this place.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.117
- Do they wanna sell?

17:15.159 --> 17:16.285
- Well, the sister does.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.078
And from what shesaid, the finances are

17:18.078 --> 17:22.124
a little precarious, whichactually works out in our favor.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.376
- Oh, I thought youwere just scouting.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.211
- I am.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.589
But if Roger buysHarmony, based on my info,

17:28.630 --> 17:29.965
that'll put me ina good position.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.926
- Mm, the VP position.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.303
- Exactly.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.097
Hey, will you do me a favor,since you're basically my only

17:37.139 --> 17:38.307
access to wifi right now?

17:38.348 --> 17:40.100
Can you look upMonroe Ranch for me?

17:40.100 --> 17:43.228
(keyboard clicking)

17:44.438 --> 17:45.522
- Monroe.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.525
Looks like they're aranching conglomeration.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.360
- Makes sense.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.446
I think they're the other offer.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.573
- We haven't put in an offer.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.657
- Yet.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.788
(soft music)

18:00.788 --> 18:03.916
(guests chattering)

18:05.000 --> 18:06.293
- Hey, folks!

18:06.335 --> 18:07.544
If I can grab yourattention for one second,

18:07.586 --> 18:10.255
I just wanted to remindeveryone that this is

18:10.297 --> 18:12.633

18:12.674 --> 18:13.967

18:14.009 --> 18:15.511
We're expecting apretty good crowd.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.346
We've all had Taylor'scooking by now,

18:17.387 --> 18:19.139
so you know how goodthe food's gonna be.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.891
- Mm-hmm.- Especially the pies.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.476
(laughing)Pecan, my favorite.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.977
I just wanted to givea heartfelt thank you

18:26.730 --> 18:28.816
and your loyalty isvery appreciated.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.692
So just wanted to say thank you.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.152
That's enough talking by me.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.862
Enjoy your night,enjoy the food.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.696
(guests applauding)

18:34.738 --> 18:37.574
(upbeat music)

18:40.160 --> 18:43.288
(guests chattering)

18:45.582 --> 18:49.837
- I ate way too much.(laughing)

18:49.878 --> 18:52.589
- Jill Tanner?- Michael Getz!

18:52.631 --> 18:53.715
Oh!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.343
- What are you doing here?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.178
- You told me aboutthis place ages ago!

18:58.220 --> 19:00.305
- Yeah, but--- Michael, this is Alex.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.557
My temporary cabinmate.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.433
Alex, this is Michael.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.977
An old co-worker of mine.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.562
- Yes.- We met earlier.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.025
- Jill here was the besthuman resources director ever.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.360
- Oh stop.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.612
It's true though.- I'm sure it is.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.365
- She was fantastic.- Aw, wow,

19:18.407 --> 19:19.324
I can't believe I'm seeing you.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.450
- Will you guys excuse me?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.035
- Oh, absolutely.- Okay.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.747
Hey, you wanna sit over there?- Yeah.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.457
- See you.- Mr. Ketchum?

19:28.876 --> 19:31.128
- Was my father.- Josh.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.380
Can I talk to you for a minute?

19:33.380 --> 19:34.256
- Sure.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.468
- You do need to sellthe ranch, don't you?

19:39.553 --> 19:41.013
- It is looking that way.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.765
- Monroe's theonly bidder so far?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.393
- Perhaps.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.228
- How much time do you haveleft with your creditors?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.688
(laughing)

19:49.730 --> 19:52.232
- If I told you that, I'dbe a terrible businessman.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.151
And contrary to mypresent situation,

19:54.192 --> 19:56.653
I'm not a terrible businessman.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.613
- Good to know.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.906
Look, I deal withvendors all the time,

19:58.906 --> 20:00.365
so I have a pretty goodsense when someone's

20:00.407 --> 20:02.409
running out of timefor other offers.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.578
My assistant tellsme that Monroe

20:04.620 --> 20:06.413
is a major ranch conglomeration,

20:06.413 --> 20:09.833
so it's unlikely they'regonna keep Harmony intact.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.711
- And Great Frontiers will?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.380
They will keep thisas a company retreat?

20:15.422 --> 20:18.508
- We wanna buy a ranch,not a piece of land.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.638
- I appreciate those words.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.767
But I still think there'sa better way, Ms. McKenna.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.644
- Alex.- Alex.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.236
(birds chirping)

20:37.277 --> 20:40.113
(rooster crowing)

21:31.123 --> 21:33.125
- Knew if I showed uphere at the crack of dawn

21:33.166 --> 21:34.084
I'd find you.

21:35.168 --> 21:36.128
- Morning Serena.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.630
- Don't be mad at me.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.506
- What do you expect?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.674
You're trying to buy my ranch.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.677
- You're selling it.- No, Taylor.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.846
Taylor put it onthe market, not me.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.265
- She's always beenthe sensible one

21:48.307 --> 21:51.560
between the two of you.(horse snorting)

21:51.601 --> 21:52.644
- So what am I?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.187
- You're the same guyyou were in high school.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.398
The kind who pretendsto be practical.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.984
Always wishing onstars and hoping that

21:59.026 --> 22:02.195
Harmony Ranch willreturn to its glory days.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.905
But that's not gonna happen.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.742
- So I should sell to you?

22:06.783 --> 22:07.826
- Unless you prefer the bank

22:07.868 --> 22:10.537
to swoop in like asuper villain, then yes.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.874
- I'll pass.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.625
- I'm not the badguy here, Josh.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.462
I'm trying to make thebest of a bad situation.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.051
- So you'll keep it intact?

22:24.092 --> 22:25.969
- You know that'snot on the agenda.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.349
- Unfortunately, theanswer's still no.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.604
- Hey, hey, Josh!

22:35.645 --> 22:37.397
Between MonroeRanch and the bank,

22:37.439 --> 22:39.107
at least we're the known entity.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.567
Who knows what's gonnahappen if the bank

22:40.567 --> 22:43.945
repossess and sellsit to some stranger?

22:43.987 --> 22:44.946
Think about that.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.704
It was good to see you.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.592
(upbeat music)

23:12.265 --> 23:15.394
(camera shuttering)

23:32.744 --> 23:34.996
(door slamming)

23:35.038 --> 23:35.914
- Ms. McKenna?

23:39.626 --> 23:41.711
Would you mind ifwe spoke in private?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.506
(soft music)

23:44.548 --> 23:46.174
So if Great Frontiersbuys this place,

23:46.216 --> 23:48.093
you're going tokeep it as a ranch?

23:49.136 --> 23:50.637
- I'm pretty surethat's the plan.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.598
- I need you to be really sure.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.809
Alex, Harmony is somuch more than just

23:55.809 --> 23:57.644
these picturesyou've been taking.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.895
I need to preserve some of that,

23:58.937 --> 24:00.480
and I need you tounderstand this place

24:00.480 --> 24:03.859
like I understand it inorder to make that happen.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.776
- So show me.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.029
Guide me throughthe ranch experience

24:08.071 --> 24:10.449
so I fully understand.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.117
- In what, a day?

24:12.159 --> 24:13.743
You're leaving tomorrow.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.829
- What if I extend mytrip through the weekend?

24:15.871 --> 24:16.913
Does that work for you?

24:18.915 --> 24:20.333
- Yeah.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.710
Yeah, that will work for me.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.171
- Great.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.172
When do we start?

24:28.008 --> 24:28.800
- Dawn.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.804
- Dawn.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.932
Great.

24:36.975 --> 24:37.976
(upbeat music)

24:38.018 --> 24:40.896
(rooster crowing)

24:43.899 --> 24:46.818
(alarm beeping)

24:49.779 --> 24:52.449
(phone ringing)

24:54.910 --> 24:57.579
(phone beeping)

25:05.170 --> 25:09.132
(speaking foreign language)

25:09.174 --> 25:10.175
- [Computer Program]Now, repeat.

25:10.217 --> 25:14.429
(speaking foreign language)

25:14.471 --> 25:16.515
- What are you listening to?(Taylor yelling)

25:16.556 --> 25:18.642
- Italian lessons.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.102
- For cooking?- No, for life.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.521
You know, in caseI ever go to Italy.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.983
Have you thought aboutwhat you'll do next?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.276
You know, once Harmony,

25:29.903 --> 25:30.987
no coffee for me, thanks.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.697
- It's not for you.- Well then,

25:32.739 --> 25:34.783
who's it for?- Ms. McKenna.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.078
- Pause, backup.

25:38.078 --> 25:38.954
What?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.289
- Gonna show her around theranch the next couple days,

25:41.331 --> 25:43.291
to make sure shesees it like we do.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.377
- Why?- 'Cause I'd like

25:45.418 --> 25:46.753
to know there'sat least a chance

25:46.753 --> 25:48.421
of preserving Harmony's history.

25:52.384 --> 25:56.304
(coffee grinder grinding)

25:56.346 --> 25:59.266
- Whoa, I thoughtthis was a dude ranch!

25:59.307 --> 26:00.517
- It's not all horses.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.435
Michael and I aregoing bike riding.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.478
- Oh.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.897
You and Michael.- It's not like that.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.567
We worked together.- Right.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.193
Back when you were married.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.571
- Well, true.- You're not married now.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.032
- Also true.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.160
- So it could be like that.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.915
- That never occurred,I haven't been

26:23.957 --> 26:26.710
on a date in 15 years.

26:26.751 --> 26:27.961
(gasping)

26:28.003 --> 26:29.796
I look like I'm goingon the Tour de France.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.966
- You look like you'regoing on a bike ride.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.469
And are very well protected.

26:36.469 --> 26:37.387
(laughing)

26:37.429 --> 26:38.847
- Oh.- Look, I'm gonna be

26:38.888 --> 26:40.640
staying for a couple moredays, through the Centennial.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.808
I'll talk to Taylorabout moving me.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.892
- Don't be silly!

26:42.934 --> 26:44.436
This cabin's toobig for only me.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.939
This is perfect.(loud knocking)

26:47.981 --> 26:48.773
Michael!

26:49.983 --> 26:52.110
Do you think I havetime to change?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.032
- I think you're good.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.830
(soft music)

27:10.170 --> 27:15.342
(phone ringing)(phone beeping)

27:22.599 --> 27:25.268
(Alex groaning)

27:33.151 --> 27:35.737
(upbeat music)

27:40.492 --> 27:41.368
- She's up.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.536
- You said dawn.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.997
- I did, I just didn'tthink you'd make it.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.207
- Well, shows you.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.751
You exceptionally thirsty?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.379
- I figured you fora coffee drinker.

27:52.420 --> 27:56.716
- I am, but I'm also extremelypicky about my coffee.

27:56.716 --> 27:57.592
- Try it.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.887
(horses whinnying)

28:00.887 --> 28:02.055
- How?

28:03.223 --> 28:06.351
- Well, cowboys are pickyabout their coffee, too.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.812
- That is good.(laughing)

28:10.855 --> 28:13.024
- You do know we needto fix this, right?

28:17.070 --> 28:19.322
- What's wrong with my boots?- Everything.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.200
(loud thudding)

28:22.242 --> 28:23.827
Lost and found.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.121
It never ceases to amaze mewhat some people leave behind.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.372
- Are there any other options?

28:27.414 --> 28:30.083
- That is the last ina ladies' size six.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.503
Your jeans, youmight wanna fix that.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.423
- These are Armani, so.- I know, that's my point.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.218
Let's see, these should work.- Okay.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.471
- What's your favorite color?- Pink.

28:45.181 --> 28:45.974
- Let's go with blue.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.225
Matches your eyes.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.104
- Is there anything else?- Gets a bit chilly,

28:51.104 --> 28:55.358
so there we go.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.069
- Perfect.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.078
You want me toclean the stables?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.246
- That's right.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.916
- Interesting sales techniqueyou have, Mr. Ketchum.

29:11.958 --> 29:15.420
- Well, you wanted tosee a side of the ranch

29:15.462 --> 29:18.798
that wasn't so pretty.- This definitely qualifies.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.967
- Cleaning stalls wasthe very first chore

29:21.009 --> 29:22.385
that Dad gave Taylor and I.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.971
Said it was thefoundation of any ranch.

29:25.013 --> 29:25.889
- Explain?

29:27.807 --> 29:30.268
- Well, having a comfortableplace for the horses to sleep

29:30.310 --> 29:31.686
keeps 'em calm.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.980
And since they're the backboneof everything we do here,

29:34.022 --> 29:35.899
as long as they're happy,things run smoothly.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.735
- Well, unfortunately for me,that is perfectly logical.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.320
But I would counter withthe fact that no one

29:40.361 --> 29:43.156
from my company is gonnawanna do this on a retreat.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.033
- Really?- Mm-hmm, yep.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.159
- Team building.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.995
Nothing bonds peoplequite like tedious labor.

29:49.996 --> 29:50.872
- Right.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.959
- Do you need me toexplain it to you, or?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.171
- No, I got this.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.048
- Let's see it.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.263
(loud scraping)

30:07.305 --> 30:09.933
(laughing)

30:09.974 --> 30:13.102
(fast upbeat music)

30:15.522 --> 30:18.358
(Alex screaming)

30:18.358 --> 30:20.235
- Give a girl a littlewarning next time.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.530
- Sorry, hay is coming in.- Thank you.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.576
Okay!

30:34.791 --> 30:36.084
Okay!

30:36.125 --> 30:38.253
(laughing)

30:47.887 --> 30:48.596
(laughing)

30:48.638 --> 30:50.265
You have goats?

30:50.306 --> 30:51.474
- I hope so.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.517
Otherwise, I'm not surewho I've been feeding

30:52.559 --> 30:53.560
for the past year.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.062
- Hey.- Here, you wanna feed 'em?

30:56.062 --> 30:58.147
- Yes!- Look, he's already started.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.191
Come here.- Come on, guys.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.248
we're trying toimpress this lady.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.417
- Well then maybe you shouldhave led with the goats.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.752
(laughing)

31:19.752 --> 31:20.712
(goats bleating)

31:20.753 --> 31:21.588
(Alex gasping)

31:21.588 --> 31:22.964
- Don't watch your diet yet?

31:24.257 --> 31:25.091
Yeah.

31:26.884 --> 31:29.512
(soft music)

31:32.390 --> 31:33.933
- When do I get to ride?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.226
- One thing at a time.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.188
Oh, man.- Here you go.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.023
- Hey.(phone chiming)

31:45.445 --> 31:46.571

31:46.613 --> 31:48.239
- No, no, no, goahead, go ahead.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.866
Enjoy these guys.(phone ringing)

31:49.907 --> 31:50.700
Come on.

31:53.036 --> 31:53.828
(bell ringing)

31:53.870 --> 31:56.205
(upbeat music)

31:56.247 --> 31:59.125
(phone ringing)

31:59.167 --> 32:02.253
- Roger Hilton.- Hi, it's Alex.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.379
(goats bleating)

32:03.421 --> 32:05.882
- My what a lovely singingvoice you must have.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.427
- Sorry, I triedto call earlier.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.263
Service is prettyhit-or-miss around here.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.514
Mostly miss.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.100
Gotta grab it while I can.- Are you headed back soon?

32:16.142 --> 32:18.102
- That is what I wantedto talk to you about.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.605
I'm gonna need to staya couple more days.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.023
- Why?

32:22.065 --> 32:25.318
- Well, I came to an agreementwith one of the owners, Josh.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.486
- What agreement?

32:26.486 --> 32:28.863
You're out there toscout, not make deals.

32:28.905 --> 32:29.989
- I know.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.157
It's just, if we want achance to make a deal,

32:31.157 --> 32:33.618
then we have toget them to let us

32:33.660 --> 32:34.827
be the ones who buy it.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.996
- So there is another buyer?

32:37.038 --> 32:39.248
- Yeah, it's a big ranch.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.583
They wanna swallow Harmony up.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.836
But Josh does not want that.- Ah ha.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.630
And what does Josh want?

32:47.006 --> 32:48.716
- To keep his family'sranch the way it's been

32:48.758 --> 32:50.176
for the past 100 years.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.345
If we can convincehim we'll do that,

32:52.387 --> 32:54.347
I think we'll beatout the other buyer.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.640
(blender rumbling)

32:55.682 --> 32:57.225
He wants to show me thefiner points of ranch life

32:57.266 --> 33:00.061
so I'll better appreciatewhat this place has to offer.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.354
- Really?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.231
Are you okay with that?- Absolutely.

33:03.272 --> 33:06.984
It's been interesting so far.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.695
But I need to staythrough until Saturday.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.989
They're having aCentennial celebration.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.281
- Celebration?

33:12.323 --> 33:13.408
I love a celebration.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.079
- Do I have your okay then?- You do.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.416

- Okay.- Oh, and Alex.

Don't make any promisesto the Ketchums.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.214
- I got it.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.387
- Smoothie?- No, I'm good.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.931
You ready to talk about this?- Let's do it.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.410
(upbeat music)

34:08.546 --> 34:11.090
- [Josh] So you were sent hereto scout, not make an offer?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.300
- [Alex] That's right.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.802
- It seems like youwanna buy this place.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.096
Why would you bedoing all this stuff?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.515
- It's a long story.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.310
- Well, good thing we have time.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.396
And you wanna massage itall the way to the seam.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.314
- Oh.- Yeah.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.358
- There's a VP position opening.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.819
I'm in competitionwith someone for it.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.321
He's bringing in a big deal,

34:33.362 --> 34:35.740
so I need to bring onein, too, if I want a shot.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.203
- So it's just business.

34:41.704 --> 34:44.165
- You say that likeit's a bad thing.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.875
- It is, if it's the only thing.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.294
- Oh, come on,you're one to talk.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.797
Your entire life is aboutthe business of this ranch.

34:50.838 --> 34:54.509
- Now, how would you knowwhat my whole life's about?

34:54.550 --> 34:55.593
- Okay, fine.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.472
Tell me one of your interestsoutside of ranching.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.643
And don't say football,'cause all guys say football.

35:05.019 --> 35:06.604
- Hmm.- Mm-hmm.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.274
- Stars.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.445
I can name every singlemajor constellation

35:14.487 --> 35:16.322
in the northern hemisphere.- Wow.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.284
Hmm.

35:20.326 --> 35:23.496
Well, I guess, I guess NorthDakota's probably pretty good

35:23.496 --> 35:27.416
for that kind of thing.- It is one of the best.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.417
You tried it?

35:28.459 --> 35:30.670
- I haven't had a chance yet.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.839
Fell asleep superearly last night.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.507
It's funny, usuallyI am up all night

35:34.507 --> 35:36.509
on my phone answeringa million emails.

35:36.509 --> 35:39.846
But I can't do that here.- Perfect.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.472
Lose the phone.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.015
Embrace the nighttime sky.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.643
The moon's almost full, sothe stars aren't as bright,

35:45.685 --> 35:48.437
but it's amazing.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.816
- I just might do that.- You should.

35:56.529 --> 36:00.783
Okay, so outside of work, whatare some of your interests?

36:00.825 --> 36:01.701
- Football.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.205
(laughing)

36:06.205 --> 36:08.457
(upbeat music)

36:08.499 --> 36:09.625
- Woo!- Oh!

36:10.501 --> 36:13.170
Oh!- Oh, man!

36:13.212 --> 36:16.424
- Are you okay?- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.426
I'm telling you, thatrock came out of nowhere.

36:18.467 --> 36:19.802
- They're knownfor their stealth.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.971
- Oh!- That's impressive.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.057
You managed to hit the onespot that wasn't protected.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.559
- Yeah, it's okay.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.810
It's just nothing.- Mm.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.228
- Yeah, it's just myshoulder, it's good, yeah.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.272
- Hold on, strong man.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.192
Just until we getback to the ranch.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.401
- All right, whoa.- You can ride

36:35.401 --> 36:36.652
with one arm.- What are you?

36:36.694 --> 36:38.905
Some kind of fielddoctor or something?

36:38.946 --> 36:40.072
(laughing)

36:40.072 --> 36:43.201
- Well, I'm a mom,so same thing.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.536
- So, how are the twins?

36:45.578 --> 36:47.288
- They just startedmiddle school.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.414
- Really?- Mm-hmm.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.083
- Gary has them this week, so--

36:51.125 --> 36:54.462
- Are you okay with all that?- Oh, great.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.464
Gary's great, I'm great.

36:56.505 --> 36:59.592
We just ultimatelyweren't great together.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.593
- Hm.- It happens.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.428
- I see.- What about you?

37:02.470 --> 37:05.514
Are you dating?- Not since Susie.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.600
Do you remember her?- Is she the one who

37:07.600 --> 37:09.393
brought her dinner tothe Christmas party?

37:09.435 --> 37:11.979
- Yeah, yeah she wasalways really particular

37:12.021 --> 37:13.147
about her food.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.776
But we broke up not longafter I got my new job.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.570
- No one since?- Not yet.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.698
I mean, this time, I'mshooting for amazing.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.495
- Well, who knows?

37:27.536 --> 37:28.955
Maybe she'll come out of nowhere

37:28.955 --> 37:30.456
when you least expect it.

37:31.749 --> 37:32.875
Like a rock.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.632
- Right, but how areyou not a Seahawks fan?

37:39.674 --> 37:40.967
- Because I grew up in Ohio,

37:40.967 --> 37:42.510
and you pick you teamwhen you're little

37:42.551 --> 37:43.844
and you stick with it forthe rest of your life,

37:43.886 --> 37:45.054
no matter what.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.014
Those are the rules,don't ask me why.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.641
Believe me, there aretimes every season

37:48.683 --> 37:53.145
I wish I was born in Boston.- Oh, no thanks.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.814
This is GiGi.- GiGi?

37:56.148 --> 37:57.733
- Yeah, this is oneof Taylor's horses.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.111
- She's a beauty.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.946
Hi.- You've ever ridden a horse?

38:03.614 --> 38:04.907
- Used to be my whole life.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.744
- Horses?

38:10.621 --> 38:11.455
- Yeah.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.833
- Really?

38:13.874 --> 38:15.960
- Yeah, I rode dressagefor five years,

38:16.002 --> 38:18.546
up until I turned 15.- Wow.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.717
What made you quit?- Money.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.761
- Yeah, money.

38:25.803 --> 38:26.887
- My mom sold insurance,

38:26.929 --> 38:29.348
my dad was a highschool science teacher.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.725
They both knew howmuch it meant to me,

38:30.766 --> 38:33.769
so they worked extra so I couldkeep riding and competing.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.399
When I realized how hardit was on them, I quit.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.111
- Really?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.696
Just like that.- Probably counts as

38:43.696 --> 38:44.822
my first heartbreak.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.160
- You ridden since?- No.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.706
- Maybe we should change that.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.629
- Yeah?- Yeah.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.007
(soft music)

39:23.069 --> 39:25.863
(upbeat music)

39:57.645 --> 39:59.814
(laughing)

40:02.900 --> 40:05.402
- Man, I am impressed.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.697
Now we just needto get you a hat.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.907
(laughing)

40:09.949 --> 40:11.200
- Why, do you have anyin the lost and found,

40:11.242 --> 40:12.785
'cause I'm almost aspicky about my head wear

40:12.785 --> 40:16.247
as I am about my coffee.- Lost and found, huh?

40:16.288 --> 40:17.289
- (laughing) Hey.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.457
- I knew I recognizedthose boots.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.709
Hey, I'm about to go into town

40:20.751 --> 40:22.086
to get some suppliesfor the Centennial.

40:22.169 --> 40:25.005
Do you want to come with andpick up some new clothes?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.633
- I would love that.- Great.

40:27.633 --> 40:28.509
- Bye.

40:34.056 --> 40:36.976
- We like her?(horse snorting)

40:37.017 --> 40:38.352
Yeah, I think so, too.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.314
(upbeat music)

40:47.403 --> 40:49.947
(slow music)

40:59.373 --> 41:02.501
(upbeat music)

41:02.501 --> 41:05.087
(car rumbling)

41:06.672 --> 41:09.008
- You know, I can'thelp but noticing,

41:09.008 --> 41:12.469
as resistant as Josh is tothe idea of selling the ranch,

41:12.511 --> 41:14.972
you don't seem quiteso upset about it.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.516
- Don't get me wrong,I love the ranch.

41:17.516 --> 41:20.811
This whole place, I meanmy heritage is here.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.938
I even convinced Joshto build a little museum

41:22.980 --> 41:24.690
to the history of Harmony.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.359
- But?

41:28.819 --> 41:30.905
- But the world is a lotbigger than one ranch,

41:30.946 --> 41:32.114
and I wanna see it.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.949
I have friends fromhigh school already

41:33.991 --> 41:35.618
on their third passport.

41:35.659 --> 41:39.538
And here I am, buildingbarbecues and making pies.

41:39.538 --> 41:41.290
All of which are good, trust me.

41:46.670 --> 41:47.796
(bell chiming)

41:47.838 --> 41:50.049
Okay, clothes are inhere, food is at the back.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.300
So I'm gonna gather my supplies,

41:51.342 --> 41:53.761
and then we can meetback here at the bait.

41:53.802 --> 41:54.720
- The bait.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.145
Hmm.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.488
(laughing)

42:22.915 --> 42:23.999
Taylor?

42:25.417 --> 42:28.337
(Taylor shushing)

42:30.547 --> 42:31.382
What?

42:32.925 --> 42:33.801
What?

42:38.889 --> 42:41.934
Who is that?- Serena Monroe.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.186
- Monroe, as in Monroe Ranch?

42:44.228 --> 42:45.771
- She's gonna push mefor an answer about

42:45.771 --> 42:47.898
buying the ranch, andwe don't have one yet.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.108
- Okay, well, thendefinitely stay back.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.192
- Okay.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.029
- [Serena] Thanks so much.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.865
- Okay, she's gone, you're good.

42:59.201 --> 43:01.787
- Serena's always been alittle intimidating for me.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.205
I was even nervous around her

43:03.247 --> 43:05.124
when she and Josh used to date.

43:07.793 --> 43:10.629
- Wait, so Serenaand Josh used--

43:10.671 --> 43:11.880
- Oh, yeah.

43:11.964 --> 43:14.216
But that was before he wentto college and met Claire.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.969
She was the one whobroke his heart.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.512
- Claire?- Mm-hmm.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.889
She was his fiance fortwo years in grad school,

43:20.931 --> 43:23.934
and then one day hecame home from Ithaca

43:23.976 --> 43:25.019
and they weren'tengaged anymore,

43:25.060 --> 43:26.061
and he never talked about it,

43:26.103 --> 43:28.147
but I could tellit bothered him.

43:28.188 --> 43:30.316
- Wait, you don't thinkSerena trying to buy the ranch

43:30.316 --> 43:32.693
is personal, do you?- No, it's just good business.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.861
And if there's anything that

43:33.902 --> 43:36.030
Serena's all about,it's business.

43:36.071 --> 43:37.823
(bell chiming)

43:37.823 --> 43:40.034
Actually, Clairewas like that, too.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.080
Huh, I guess Josh has a type.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.752
And that's me totallyoversharing about my brother.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.837
(laughing)

43:51.879 --> 43:52.671
- Okay.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.049
(laughing)

43:56.842 --> 43:59.345
(upbeat music)

44:05.017 --> 44:06.352
(loud knocking)

44:06.393 --> 44:08.354
- Am I interrupting?- Ben, perfect.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.022
This will go muchfaster with two people.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.358
- Is that the--- Folding kayak.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.152
Prototype from Oregon,lighter material.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.028
Come on.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.032
So what brings you by?

44:20.074 --> 44:21.700
- Well, I've been doingsome more research

44:21.742 --> 44:23.702
on the Arizonadistribution facility.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.245
- Pop that into place, there.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.248
- Thinking longterm, itoccurs to me we'll probably

44:28.290 --> 44:31.001
need a second onewithin a couple years.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.836
- Tighten your bow strap.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.046
Second one, what?

44:34.088 --> 44:35.798
- Second distribution facility.

44:35.839 --> 44:40.886
So the way I'm figuring is,why not secure that second site

44:40.928 --> 44:42.888
right now, while we'realready thinking about

44:42.888 --> 44:44.014
what we really need?

44:45.099 --> 44:46.225
- And you're bow faring.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.019
- This time we buildit from scratch,

44:49.061 --> 44:51.397
we build it to ourown specifications,

44:51.397 --> 44:52.940
like we've always talked about.

44:52.981 --> 44:55.192
- You have a place in mind?- I do.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.779
Harmony Ranch, North Dakota.

45:02.574 --> 45:05.202
(soft music)

45:10.290 --> 45:14.253
(Jill and Michael chattering)

45:27.724 --> 45:30.269
(upbeat music)

45:40.446 --> 45:41.530
- Hey.- Oh!

45:41.572 --> 45:43.198
- Sorry, didn'tmean to disturb you.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.283
- Oh, no, it's okay.

45:44.366 --> 45:45.242
Taylor told me aboutthis place earlier,

45:45.284 --> 45:46.326
so I wanted to check it out.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.538
So all of this is Harmony?

45:51.457 --> 45:52.207
- Mostly.

45:52.249 --> 45:55.002
But also in echoes.

45:56.295 --> 45:57.588
(laughing)

45:57.629 --> 45:59.381
Yeah, that's Hank Ketchum.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.466
He founded the ranch.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.468
- And had a flair for fashion.

46:02.509 --> 46:03.719
- [Josh] Yes, he did.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.388
- How long has the ranchbeen in your family?

46:06.430 --> 46:08.474
- Four generations.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.058
Hoping there'll be a fifth.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.563
- Did you know how muchtrouble the ranch was in?

46:16.148 --> 46:17.149
- No.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.318
No, dad was incharge, and I was away

46:19.318 --> 46:22.029
at grad schooluntil six years ago.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.615
- Where'd you go?- Cornell.

46:25.699 --> 46:26.909
MS in Animal Science.

46:27.034 --> 46:29.244
And it's also where I ranacross a little coffee shop

46:29.286 --> 46:30.496
called Aunt Mary's Coffee,

46:30.496 --> 46:32.289
and I still get the beansfrom there to this day.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.500
- I fully support thatextravagant decision.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.667
- Yeah, thank you.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.337
And by the way, love the outfit.

46:38.378 --> 46:39.254
- Thank you.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.381
I'm aware that it'sfunny that I work

46:41.423 --> 46:42.841
for an outdooradventure gear company

46:42.883 --> 46:45.177
and I had to getmy ranch wardrobe

46:45.177 --> 46:47.387
at a local general store, but.

46:47.429 --> 46:49.014

46:49.014 --> 46:52.184

55:55.560 --> 55:57.062
How did you get him to do it?

55:57.854 --> 55:59.898
- Just handed him a bowl.

55:59.939 --> 56:02.859
(laughing)

56:02.901 --> 56:04.402
- Good morning.

56:04.402 --> 56:05.737
- Hi!

56:05.779 --> 56:08.073
- It has occurredto me, Ms. McKenna,

56:08.114 --> 56:10.742
you have yet to experiencethat most basic excursion

56:10.784 --> 56:13.703
on this ranch.- And what is that?

56:13.745 --> 56:14.621
- Trail riding.

56:16.289 --> 56:17.165
- Finally!

56:18.416 --> 56:19.542
- Let's go!- Okay!

56:20.293 --> 56:22.921
(soft music)

56:31.679 --> 56:33.515
(Alex sighing)

56:33.556 --> 56:34.641
- How does it feel?

56:35.809 --> 56:37.393
- It's amazing.- Yes it is.

56:40.730 --> 56:41.606
You know what?

56:41.773 --> 56:43.608
Come see, somethingI wanna show you.

56:43.608 --> 56:44.484
Come on.

56:55.703 --> 56:57.664
So this was the first cabinbuilt on the property.

56:57.705 --> 57:00.500
My great-grandfatherbuilt it 100 years ago.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.793
- [Alex] 100 years ago?

57:01.793 --> 57:03.002
Wow, you guys havereally kept it up.

57:03.044 --> 57:04.963
- Well, that's all Taylor,for the Centennial.

57:05.004 --> 57:06.172
It's a special place.

57:06.214 --> 57:08.299
You know, my grandfatherwas actually born here.

57:08.341 --> 57:09.217
- Wow.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.886
- Yeah, he used to teachus all about the stars

57:11.928 --> 57:15.765
and the constellations,and the moon, too.

57:15.807 --> 57:17.892
- Moon gazing?- Wishin' on a moon,

57:17.934 --> 57:19.185
especially an autumn moon.

57:20.061 --> 57:21.271
Why an autumn moon?

57:22.814 --> 57:24.816
- It's the only time theweather's really cool enough

57:24.858 --> 57:27.068
you can pause to reflect.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.571
- Take stock of what you have.

57:29.612 --> 57:30.864
- Yeah.

57:30.905 --> 57:32.407
- So peaceful here.

57:34.325 --> 57:37.078
(birds chirping)

57:38.288 --> 57:39.664
- It's almost hard tobelieve there was one point

57:39.706 --> 57:40.582
when I was getting my master's,

57:40.623 --> 57:42.000
I almost didn't come back here.

57:42.041 --> 57:42.917
- Why?

57:45.336 --> 57:48.798
- Love, or what Ithought was love.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.050
But turns out it wasn't.

57:52.010 --> 57:54.095
Guess everyone getshurt from time to time.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.472
- Hmm, not me.

57:56.514 --> 57:57.640
Not really.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.350
I mean, a few bruiseshere and there, but.

57:59.350 --> 58:00.852
(laughing)

58:00.894 --> 58:04.147
I guess I never reallyhad time for a real risk.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.106
- Why is that?

58:06.441 --> 58:09.194
- My parents made so manysacrifices for me growing up,

58:09.861 --> 58:11.696
I didn't wanna let 'em down.

58:11.696 --> 58:14.908
So I worked really hard soI could get a scholarship

58:14.949 --> 58:16.201
and go to the best schools,

58:16.242 --> 58:17.577
so I could get the best job,

58:17.619 --> 58:19.787
and the best job after that.

58:19.829 --> 58:20.914
- Yeah.

58:20.955 --> 58:22.040
- Now, I've got this great job,

58:22.040 --> 58:25.585
but working really hardfor a promotion, so.

58:26.544 --> 58:28.880
- What do you think'snext for you after that?

58:30.006 --> 58:31.925
- I don't know.

58:31.966 --> 58:33.009
Thought I knew.

58:36.888 --> 58:38.723
Josh, I work for anoutdoors adventure company

58:38.765 --> 58:41.726
and I don't have time to gooutdoors and have an adventure.

58:41.726 --> 58:43.394
- That's not right.- So not right!

58:43.394 --> 58:44.729
(laughing)

58:44.729 --> 58:48.107
But this, I mean, all of this,

58:48.900 --> 58:51.027
and the horses,this feels right.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.242
- Why do you think I fightso hard for this place?

58:58.034 --> 58:59.160
- I get it.

58:59.869 --> 59:00.912
It has to stay a ranch.

59:00.954 --> 59:02.038
It has to stay Harmony.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.270
- Riding, looking at old cabins,

59:25.270 --> 59:27.438

59:28.273 --> 59:31.025
- Seriously.- Seriously.

59:31.067 --> 59:31.943
- Seriously?

59:33.069 --> 59:35.822
Is pie baking somethingthey do on the dude ranch?

59:35.863 --> 59:37.365
- Well, there werespecial circumstances

59:37.407 --> 59:40.410

Oh, looks likeBen went with him.

59:51.045 --> 59:51.754

59:51.796 --> 59:52.797
That's odd.

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:09.480
- Everything'sbeen the clincher.

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:11.899
Just let me knowwhen Roger gets back.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:13.401
- Okay, I'll do my best,but you're not easy

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:15.194

- I think my pride isa much bigger wound.

1:00:39.677 --> 1:00:40.553
I'm so clumsy.

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:42.096
I tripped over my own feet.

1:00:42.138 --> 1:00:43.765
(laughing)

1:00:43.806 --> 1:00:45.266

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:50.355
- I told her Harmonywas a great place.

1:00:50.355 --> 1:00:51.856
- Yes, you did.

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:53.900
He'd come back in the officeafter spending time here,

1:00:53.941 --> 1:00:55.943
and say, guys, guys, you have

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:59.155

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.118
It's why I came here.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.037
To see if you were right.

1:01:06.079 --> 1:01:07.747
You were right.- All right.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:10.875

1:01:33.773 --> 1:01:34.649

1:01:35.942 --> 1:01:37.026
All that talk aboutthe moon earlier

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:38.611
made me realize Ihaven't had a chance

1:01:38.653 --> 1:01:40.154
to go stargazing yet.

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:43.282
(laughing)

I know a great spot.

- And?- It's basically

1:02:28.494 --> 1:02:29.787
an hour and a half.

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:32.915
- That's not far at all.- No, it isn't.

1:02:33.958 --> 1:02:34.834

1:02:53.311 --> 1:02:56.147
- Okay, so there's Orion.- Oh, that's an easy one.

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:57.148
Anyone can find him.

1:02:57.231 --> 1:02:58.483
He's always got hisbelt sitting up.

1:02:58.524 --> 1:02:59.650
(laughing)

1:02:59.692 --> 1:03:01.152
- All right.

1:03:01.152 --> 1:03:02.653
All right, somethingmore difficult.

1:03:02.653 --> 1:03:04.363
- Yeah, come on, dazzle me.

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:08.284

1:03:30.181 --> 1:03:32.225
You would pick the horse.- I would.

1:03:37.688 --> 1:03:40.399
If you're cold, we can go in.

1:03:42.568 --> 1:03:43.778
- No, I'm good.

1:03:47.448 --> 1:03:48.241
- There you are!

1:03:48.282 --> 1:03:50.201
Oh, didn't mean to interrupt.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.641

(laughing)

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:34.495

- You know, Roger snores loudly.

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:02.273

And stop evading my question.

1:05:06.444 --> 1:05:07.320
Why are you here?

1:05:08.362 --> 1:05:09.947
- You know Roger, helikes to see things

1:05:09.947 --> 1:05:12.366
with his own eyes, kick thetires before making a move.

1:05:12.408 --> 1:05:13.492
You know?- So he's gonna

1:05:13.534 --> 1:05:17.538
make a move on Harmony?- Yeah, I'm sure of it.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.629
- Did I see you holdingAlex's hand last night?

1:05:26.088 --> 1:05:27.548

- Yeah, but if hercompany buys Harmony,

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:34.096
then they'll come back.

1:05:34.138 --> 1:05:35.890
She might be back, andthen you could stay on.

1:05:35.931 --> 1:05:37.808

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:39.018

I wouldn't be ableto get anything done.

1:06:06.379 --> 1:06:08.297

- Ben's the one thatcame with Roger, right?

1:09:05.850 --> 1:09:08.269
- Yes, and he's prettysure that Roger wants

1:09:08.310 --> 1:09:09.186
to buy Harmony.

1:09:11.605 --> 1:09:14.358
- And keep it intact like it is?

1:09:14.358 --> 1:09:16.443
- I think so.- Yes!

1:09:16.485 --> 1:09:18.654
(laughing)

1:09:19.405 --> 1:09:20.573
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.

1:09:20.614 --> 1:09:22.199
Thank you so much.- No, don't thank me.

1:09:22.241 --> 1:09:23.367
It's you.

1:09:23.409 --> 1:09:24.201
You're the one whokept this place

1:09:24.243 --> 1:09:24.952
working all these years.

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:27.162
I'm so glad you did.

1:09:27.204 --> 1:09:28.747
- You really likeit here, don't you?

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:29.915
- Are you kidding?

1:09:29.957 --> 1:09:31.500
I love it.

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:32.960
I really do.- Yeah.

1:09:33.002 --> 1:09:33.878
That's good.

1:09:38.382 --> 1:09:39.466
That's great.

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:41.385
- I gotta go talk to Roger.- Yeah.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:43.554
Okay, yeah.- Okay.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:44.680
- All right.

1:09:46.181 --> 1:09:47.808
Hey, Alex?- Yeah.

1:09:49.643 --> 1:09:50.769
- Save me a dance later?

1:09:51.729 --> 1:09:52.605
- I'll save two.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:00.154
- Yes.

1:10:05.242 --> 1:10:06.327
(loud clanging)

1:10:06.368 --> 1:10:10.289
- Oh, close, close.(loud clanging)

1:10:10.331 --> 1:10:11.665
- Oh, wow.

1:10:12.416 --> 1:10:13.584
- Huh?- Very nice.

1:10:13.584 --> 1:10:15.252
- Roger?- There she is.

1:10:15.252 --> 1:10:17.546
- I was so surprised whenTaylor told me you were here.

1:10:17.588 --> 1:10:19.381
- Well, I had to comefor the celebration.

1:10:19.423 --> 1:10:20.299
- You had a chanceto look around?

1:10:20.341 --> 1:10:21.425
- A little.

1:10:21.425 --> 1:10:22.468
I got up at first lightand went for a walk.

1:10:22.509 --> 1:10:23.844
Tried to get Ben to come with.

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:25.346
- Yeah, my hip's still cramped

1:10:25.387 --> 1:10:26.680
from sleeping on the sofa.

1:10:26.722 --> 1:10:28.724
- Well, I can assure you theguest cabins are much nicer.

1:10:28.766 --> 1:10:30.726
Employees are gonna be fightingover who gets which one.

1:10:30.768 --> 1:10:31.977
- For?- The retreat,

1:10:32.019 --> 1:10:33.979
here at Harmony.- Oh, I already

1:10:34.021 --> 1:10:35.773
bought a new company retreat.

1:10:37.566 --> 1:10:38.692
- I'm sorry, what?- Yeah, a great deal

1:10:38.817 --> 1:10:41.612
came up yesterday fora property in Hawaii.

1:10:41.612 --> 1:10:44.365
- Ben just said that--- Yeah, I said he was

1:10:44.406 --> 1:10:45.824
interested in buying Harmony.

1:10:45.866 --> 1:10:48.535
I never said it wasfor the retreat.

1:10:49.703 --> 1:10:51.163
- Then what are you?- Well, Ben suggested

1:10:51.205 --> 1:10:53.082
we build a seconddistribution center here.

1:10:53.123 --> 1:10:54.875
- Totally new fromthe ground up.

1:10:57.628 --> 1:10:58.629
- Seriously?

1:10:58.671 --> 1:10:59.880
- Don't you like the idea?

1:11:01.423 --> 1:11:03.592
- Josh is nevergonna go for that.

1:11:03.634 --> 1:11:08.639
- Then we don't tell Josh.- Don't tell Josh what?

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:11.976
- Josh, didn't knowyou were there.

1:11:15.521 --> 1:11:17.106
- Don't tell Josh what?

1:11:18.148 --> 1:11:21.110
- That Roger isafraid of horses.

1:11:21.151 --> 1:11:22.027
- That's okay.

1:11:23.654 --> 1:11:26.365
You're just planning ontearing this place down?

1:11:28.659 --> 1:11:30.661
After you buy it andput a giant warehouse

1:11:30.703 --> 1:11:32.663
for all your adventure stuff.

1:11:32.663 --> 1:11:33.580
Guess I was standingthere a little bit longer

1:11:33.622 --> 1:11:35.165
than you thought.- Josh.

1:11:35.165 --> 1:11:36.333
- I've heard enough.

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:45.426
- Josh.

1:11:47.553 --> 1:11:51.432
- Well, looks like the Harmonydeal just fell through.

1:11:52.516 --> 1:11:55.352
Fortunately, we still have theArizona distribution center

1:11:55.352 --> 1:11:59.648
in place, so guess wecan get going on that.

1:11:59.690 --> 1:12:00.983
Yeah?

1:12:01.025 --> 1:12:03.652
(soft music)

1:12:05.654 --> 1:12:08.449
(birds chirping)

1:12:09.324 --> 1:12:10.159
- Josh!

1:12:12.286 --> 1:12:13.537
Josh.

1:12:13.579 --> 1:12:14.538
You have to believe me.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:16.123
I had no idea thiswas gonna happen.

1:12:17.624 --> 1:12:18.834
- I know.

1:12:18.876 --> 1:12:21.545
Alex, I thought thatselling my family's heritage

1:12:21.587 --> 1:12:22.796
for pasture was a bad idea,

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:27.468
but a distributioncenter is much worse.

1:12:27.509 --> 1:12:28.886
- I'm so sorry.

1:12:30.054 --> 1:12:31.764
I wish there wassomething more I could do.

1:12:35.726 --> 1:12:37.144
- Maybe this is a good thing.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:40.731
You know, Taylor,she's ready to travel.

1:12:40.773 --> 1:12:42.066
This ranch is holding her back.

1:12:42.107 --> 1:12:43.359
That's not fair to her.

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:44.276
- What about you?

1:12:48.906 --> 1:12:49.782
- I'll be fine.

1:12:51.742 --> 1:12:54.369
Thank you for trying to help.

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:57.873
- I had to, I love this place.

1:12:59.416 --> 1:13:00.167
- Me, too.

1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:16.266
- Hey.- Sorry, it was too good.

1:13:16.308 --> 1:13:18.727
(laughing)

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:24.650
- So that's it, then?

1:13:25.651 --> 1:13:26.527
- That's it.

1:13:27.945 --> 1:13:29.154
(sighs)

1:13:29.196 --> 1:13:30.072
- What now?

1:13:34.952 --> 1:13:35.828
- We sell.

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:39.331
It's been inevitable.

1:13:41.166 --> 1:13:42.835
I just had a hardtime admitting it.

1:13:46.296 --> 1:13:47.840
- So weird looking outat all this activity

1:13:47.881 --> 1:13:49.883
and it won't change a thing.

1:13:49.925 --> 1:13:50.759
- Yeah.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:54.805
Should know I had aconversation with Alex

1:13:54.805 --> 1:13:57.057
that maybe this is a good thing.

1:13:57.099 --> 1:13:58.225
- How'd you figure?

1:14:01.436 --> 1:14:03.147
- I've been working toohard hanging onto the past.

1:14:03.188 --> 1:14:05.732
And maybe it's time tolet it go, let you go.

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:08.902
Off on your adventures.

1:14:12.489 --> 1:14:14.366
- You know I do love this place.

1:14:16.076 --> 1:14:16.952
- I know you do.

1:14:18.537 --> 1:14:19.997
Got a lot of good memories here.

1:14:21.874 --> 1:14:23.667
- And we'll alwayshave each other.

1:14:24.710 --> 1:14:26.670
- You're not gettingrid of me that easy.

1:14:26.712 --> 1:14:27.796
(laughing)

1:14:27.921 --> 1:14:29.882
Lasso your friends,embarrass you a little bit.

1:14:29.923 --> 1:14:31.508
- Gonna have to find me, first.

1:14:34.511 --> 1:14:37.848
(guests chattering)

1:14:37.848 --> 1:14:40.017
- The lesser of two evils.

1:14:40.058 --> 1:14:40.934
- Yep.

1:14:57.034 --> 1:15:00.370
- (laughing) Yeah.

1:15:00.412 --> 1:15:01.497
There we go.

1:15:02.873 --> 1:15:04.500
- Roger?- Alex.

1:15:04.541 --> 1:15:07.044
Before you say anything,I have one question.

1:15:08.295 --> 1:15:10.047
Do you know wherethey keep the waders?

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:11.924
- What?

1:15:12.049 --> 1:15:13.175
- 'Cause I think weshould go fishing.

1:15:24.019 --> 1:15:26.939
(reel whirring)

1:15:28.982 --> 1:15:30.025
I love fishing.

1:15:31.944 --> 1:15:32.819
I love nature.

1:15:34.905 --> 1:15:36.865
It's why I started GreatFrontiers in the first place.

1:15:36.907 --> 1:15:38.867
For people like me wholove being outdoors

1:15:38.909 --> 1:15:40.410
in all its glory.

1:15:40.452 --> 1:15:41.745
- Can we just talkabout this, now?

1:15:41.745 --> 1:15:42.663
- In a minute.

1:15:45.666 --> 1:15:47.042
Now, I think it'simportant in life

1:15:47.167 --> 1:15:50.045
when a person loves what theydo and does what they love.

1:15:51.213 --> 1:15:54.341
'Cause then it'll havemeaning and value.

1:15:55.509 --> 1:15:57.135
When you truly valuesomething you always strive

1:15:57.177 --> 1:15:58.220
to do right by it.

1:15:59.471 --> 1:16:00.722
- Look, if you love natureas much as you claim you do,

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:02.891
then even the idea oftearing all this down,

1:16:02.933 --> 1:16:04.893
getting rid of the ranchjust so we can have

1:16:04.935 --> 1:16:09.231
another warehouse, itshould be appalling to you.

1:16:11.024 --> 1:16:13.235
You know I think it is.- Do you?

1:16:13.277 --> 1:16:15.946
- Yes.- Why?

1:16:15.988 --> 1:16:17.197
- Because it's wrong!

1:16:18.156 --> 1:16:21.994
These trees, thisriver, the horses.

1:16:25.664 --> 1:16:29.001
People, they all have value.

1:16:32.921 --> 1:16:35.257
- And that is why Iwanted you to be the one

1:16:35.299 --> 1:16:36.174
to come out here.

1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:39.469
- What?

1:16:39.469 --> 1:16:41.513
- You are an intelligent person.

1:16:41.555 --> 1:16:43.307
A great executive.

1:16:43.348 --> 1:16:46.643
Your co-workers love you,yet you're not a pushover.

1:16:46.643 --> 1:16:48.478
But if you're gonna moveup into the VP position,

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:50.814
I need to know thatyou love what I love.

1:16:51.815 --> 1:16:52.649
This.

1:16:53.984 --> 1:16:57.279
- So my coming out here was--

1:16:57.321 --> 1:17:00.407
- I like to think of itas a fishing expedition.

1:17:01.491 --> 1:17:02.326
Of a kind.

1:17:03.785 --> 1:17:06.330
- If I had to choose betweenthe development and the land--

1:17:06.371 --> 1:17:07.497
- Which would it be?

1:17:08.498 --> 1:17:10.542
- The land.- That's what I like to hear.

1:17:13.086 --> 1:17:14.338
Look, I love my company,

1:17:14.338 --> 1:17:15.631
and I am proud ofwhat we've become,

1:17:15.672 --> 1:17:18.175
but it can't allbe about business.

1:17:19.801 --> 1:17:21.845
- But this seconddistribution center.

1:17:21.845 --> 1:17:23.972
- Oh, that was nevera consideration.

1:17:24.723 --> 1:17:26.016
- Ben thought it was.

1:17:26.058 --> 1:17:27.517
- Which is why hedoesn't work for me

1:17:27.559 --> 1:17:30.228
as of about 42 minutes ago.

1:17:31.521 --> 1:17:33.565
I wanted to know if he couldstill push for his project

1:17:33.607 --> 1:17:35.233
if he saw the beauty firsthand.

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:37.736
He could.

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:44.034
- So what are youplanning for Harmony?

1:17:45.243 --> 1:17:46.119
- Nothing.

1:17:47.371 --> 1:17:49.206
I chose a dude ranch mainlybecause of your history

1:17:49.247 --> 1:17:50.582
with equestrian riding.

1:17:53.001 --> 1:17:54.127
- You know about that?

1:17:54.169 --> 1:17:56.713
- Oh, our backgroundchecks are very thorough.

1:17:56.713 --> 1:17:59.049
(laughing)

1:17:59.091 --> 1:18:01.551
I thought you'd respondwell to horses again.

1:18:03.261 --> 1:18:06.264
- Okay, but what about thenew Great Frontiers retreat?

1:18:07.724 --> 1:18:11.686
- Well, I really did geta great deal in Hawaii.

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:16.733
But what do youthink I should do?

1:18:22.155 --> 1:18:23.031
- I think,

1:18:25.617 --> 1:18:27.911
I think I have a newidea I wanna run by you.

1:18:27.953 --> 1:18:29.955
Just might giveeveryone what they want.

1:18:38.630 --> 1:18:41.049
(soft music)

1:18:41.091 --> 1:18:43.176
- So does that meanHarmony won't be open

1:18:43.218 --> 1:18:44.511
for guests anymore?

1:18:44.553 --> 1:18:46.346
- It won't be open for anyone.

1:18:48.140 --> 1:18:49.015
I'm sorry.

1:18:49.933 --> 1:18:51.601
- Oh, honey, don't apologize.

1:18:51.643 --> 1:18:53.979
You're the one havingto leave your home.

1:18:55.355 --> 1:18:56.189
- Yeah.

1:18:57.524 --> 1:18:58.859
It's becoming real.

1:18:59.985 --> 1:19:01.111
- Do you know where Josh is?

1:19:01.111 --> 1:19:02.154
- He's with Serena.

1:19:03.113 --> 1:19:03.822
- Why?

1:19:03.864 --> 1:19:04.906
- To sign the contracts.

1:19:06.116 --> 1:19:07.659
- Oh, no.

1:19:07.701 --> 1:19:09.411
No, where are they?

1:19:10.537 --> 1:19:11.455
- In the house.

1:19:21.798 --> 1:19:23.925
- So this includesall the horses?

1:19:23.967 --> 1:19:26.344
- Yes, they'll bewell taken care of.

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:28.638
- I know.

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:30.182
You love your horses.

1:19:31.141 --> 1:19:33.894
- You can come visitthem anytime you want.

1:19:33.935 --> 1:19:36.021
Like I said, I'm notthe bad guy here.

1:19:42.819 --> 1:19:43.653
- Stop!

1:19:45.572 --> 1:19:46.782
Josh, you don't wanna do this.

1:19:46.823 --> 1:19:49.034
- This is the best option.

1:19:49.075 --> 1:19:50.160
- What if it's not?

1:19:50.202 --> 1:19:52.120
- Who are you?- I'm Alex McKenna.

1:19:52.162 --> 1:19:53.997
I'm the new VP atGreat Frontiers.

1:19:53.997 --> 1:19:55.749
And I have aproposition for you.

1:19:58.126 --> 1:20:01.046
(upbeat music)

1:20:01.087 --> 1:20:02.547
So it seems likeeveryone has an opinion

1:20:02.589 --> 1:20:04.299
about what to dowith Harmony Ranch.

1:20:04.341 --> 1:20:06.343
Serena wanted to turnit into graze land.

1:20:06.343 --> 1:20:09.513
- And Great Frontiers hasdiscussed repurposing the land,

1:20:09.554 --> 1:20:11.014
for a distribution warehouse.

1:20:11.014 --> 1:20:12.849
- And I originally cameout here to scout it

1:20:12.849 --> 1:20:14.935
for a trainingcenter and retreat.

1:20:14.976 --> 1:20:19.523
But the best idea would beto keep it the way it is.

1:20:19.564 --> 1:20:20.482
Only busier.

1:20:22.275 --> 1:20:23.360
- How?

1:20:23.401 --> 1:20:24.903
- Well, dude ranchesare big business.

1:20:24.945 --> 1:20:27.072
Everyone loves coming hereand dressing up like a cowboy

1:20:27.113 --> 1:20:30.075
or a cowgirl andgoing on adventures.

1:20:30.116 --> 1:20:31.910
- True.- And while Great Frontiers

1:20:31.952 --> 1:20:34.496
is an amazing company withmillions of loyal customers--

1:20:34.538 --> 1:20:37.541
- We've never had a westernoutfitting division.

1:20:39.292 --> 1:20:40.460
Until now.

1:20:41.586 --> 1:20:43.380
- We wanna have a reliablepartnership destination

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:45.173
for our customersas an incentive.

1:20:45.215 --> 1:20:48.301
- We'd call it GreatFrontiers at Harmony Ranch.

1:20:48.343 --> 1:20:52.389
Your ranch, ourproducts, everybody wins.

1:20:52.389 --> 1:20:54.224
- We'll pay off whatyou owe the bank

1:20:54.224 --> 1:20:57.102
and go forward asequal partners.

1:20:57.143 --> 1:20:59.271
If that's all right with you.

1:20:59.312 --> 1:21:03.066
- And--- Oh, right.

1:21:03.066 --> 1:21:05.569
Taylor, it turns outthe Great Frontiers team

1:21:05.610 --> 1:21:07.487
is in dire need ofan executive chef,

1:21:07.529 --> 1:21:09.072

1:21:10.907 --> 1:21:12.200
You don't suppose--- Yes, yes.

1:21:12.242 --> 1:21:13.660
- But don't you wannahear the full offer?

1:21:13.702 --> 1:21:15.245
- No, no, no, I get it.

1:21:15.245 --> 1:21:19.082
I'm your chef, ifthat's okay with you.

1:21:19.124 --> 1:21:20.000
- Yeah.

1:21:24.296 --> 1:21:26.089
Is this for real?

1:21:26.089 --> 1:21:28.258
- I told you I'dfight for Harmony.

1:21:35.140 --> 1:21:36.808
- I'm gonna take that as a yes.

1:21:36.850 --> 1:21:38.476
- It's a yes from me.

1:21:38.518 --> 1:21:39.728
- Yes, definitely.

1:21:39.769 --> 1:21:41.646
Definitely yes.- All right.

1:21:47.777 --> 1:21:48.695
- Would you excuseme for a minute?

1:21:48.737 --> 1:21:49.529
- Yeah.

1:21:52.449 --> 1:21:54.618
Yes!(laughing)

1:21:57.245 --> 1:21:58.330
- [Alex] Ben!

1:22:03.293 --> 1:22:05.587
- I was really hopingto storm off in a huff.

1:22:05.629 --> 1:22:08.214
- I'm sorry.- Why?

1:22:08.256 --> 1:22:09.424
You won.

1:22:09.466 --> 1:22:10.800
- It's not about winning.

1:22:12.010 --> 1:22:14.054
Okay, maybe in the beginningit was about winning.

1:22:14.095 --> 1:22:16.097
Definitely in the beginningit was about winning,

1:22:16.139 --> 1:22:18.808
but now it's more aboutdoing what's right

1:22:18.808 --> 1:22:23.021
for this ranch, and thepeople, and the land.

1:22:23.063 --> 1:22:26.274
- Wow, you reallysound like Roger.

1:22:26.316 --> 1:22:28.318
Good job.- Thanks.

1:22:30.487 --> 1:22:31.321
Good luck, Ben.

1:22:32.238 --> 1:22:34.699
I mean that.- You do, don't you?

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:37.911
All right.

1:22:38.662 --> 1:22:39.663
I hope things work out for you.

1:22:39.704 --> 1:22:41.247
- Thank you.

1:22:41.289 --> 1:22:42.415
You, too.

1:22:46.336 --> 1:22:49.422
(soft guitar music)

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:54.344
- I still cannot believeyou saved this place.

1:22:54.344 --> 1:22:55.720
- Well, you and Taylor arethe one who kept it going

1:22:55.762 --> 1:22:58.223
long enough for thecavalry to arrive.

1:22:58.264 --> 1:22:59.516
- So what are thecavalry's plans?

1:22:59.516 --> 1:23:01.267
You heading back to Seattle?

1:23:01.309 --> 1:23:03.353
- Well, Roger has aprivate plane chartered

1:23:03.353 --> 1:23:04.813
for tomorrow morning, so.

1:23:06.356 --> 1:23:07.691
- Oh.

1:23:07.691 --> 1:23:12.779
- But I was thinking aboutstaying a little while longer.

1:23:14.531 --> 1:23:15.615
- How much longer?

1:23:15.657 --> 1:23:17.283
- Well, I told Rogerit might be a good idea

1:23:17.325 --> 1:23:18.827
while we get the newdivision up and running,

1:23:18.868 --> 1:23:21.287
if I stay entrenchedin the environment,

1:23:21.329 --> 1:23:23.373
you know, so I knowwhat I'm talking about.

1:23:23.415 --> 1:23:25.291
- It's a pretty smart idea.

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:27.877
- You think so?- I do, I do.

1:23:27.877 --> 1:23:29.129
And I think youmight need someone,

1:23:29.170 --> 1:23:31.214
I don't know, who knowsthe Western lifestyle.

1:23:31.256 --> 1:23:33.717
- You may need someone tohelp you out with the horses.

1:23:33.717 --> 1:23:34.467
- It's very true.

1:23:34.509 --> 1:23:35.802
I happen to know a guy.

1:23:37.303 --> 1:23:38.555
- Well, I know a girl.

1:23:38.555 --> 1:23:41.433
- She have any experience?

1:23:41.474 --> 1:23:42.642
- She has potential.

1:23:45.228 --> 1:23:47.731
When will she start?- Right away.

1:23:50.358 --> 1:23:51.609
- Wait, this first lessondoesn't have anything

1:23:51.651 --> 1:23:53.611
to do with a pitchforkand hay, does it?

1:23:53.653 --> 1:23:55.447
- No, but it does involveputting those boots

1:23:55.488 --> 1:23:59.284
to good use.

1:23:59.325 --> 1:23:59.951
