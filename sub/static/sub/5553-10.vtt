00:03.038 --> 00:05.830
Sheldon Cooper's
descent into madness...

00:05.846 --> 00:09.315
day two.

00:09.317 --> 00:10.850
It's 2:25 a.m.,

00:10.852 --> 00:14.787
and I feel the urge to urinate.

00:14.789 --> 00:18.090
My normal urination time
is 7:10 a.m.,

00:18.092 --> 00:21.027
but here I am,
in the middle of the night,

00:21.029 --> 00:23.195
struggling to keep my mind sharp

00:23.197 --> 00:26.999
and my pajamas dry.

00:27.001 --> 00:28.301
It's only a matter of time

00:28.303 --> 00:32.872
before my tenuous grasp
on reality fades.

00:32.874 --> 00:36.842
I suppose I should pee while
I still know what a toilet is.

00:51.292 --> 00:54.160
Since when do you hum songs?

00:54.162 --> 00:55.294
What are you talking
about?

00:55.296 --> 00:56.595
You were just humming.
Are you sure?

00:56.597 --> 00:59.565
Sometimes when my brain
really gets moving,

00:59.567 --> 01:02.134
it makes noise.

01:02.136 --> 01:04.437
How does your brain feel about
calculating the surface tension

01:04.438 --> 01:05.705
of the domain walls?

01:05.707 --> 01:08.007
Let's see.

01:09.210 --> 01:12.311
Hey! I <i> was</i> humming.

01:12.313 --> 01:15.514
One point
for Hufflepuff.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.386
What song is that?

01:20.388 --> 01:23.222
Well... Hum it again.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.926
Is that the <i> SpongeBob</i> song?

01:26.928 --> 01:31.097
♪ Who lives
in a pineapple ♪ Nope.

01:31.099 --> 01:32.498
Whatever. Can we just
get back to this?

01:32.500 --> 01:33.866
I feel like I know
what song that is,

01:33.868 --> 01:36.402
but I can't put
my finger on it.

01:36.404 --> 01:39.572

02:24.959 --> 02:27.159
Hello, yes, I was hoping
you could help me.

02:27.161 --> 02:31.731
What song is this?
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la. ♪

02:31.733 --> 02:33.132
You don't know?

02:33.134 --> 02:34.600
Well, how dare you
call yourselves

02:34.602 --> 02:37.903
a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

02:37.905 --> 02:40.706
My goodness. Do you sing along
to the greatest hits

02:40.708 --> 02:43.009
of Elvis Presley
with that mouth?

02:43.011 --> 02:45.478
Well, they were no help at all.
Which is crazy,

02:45.480 --> 02:49.515
since rock and roll is all
about good customer service.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.550
Yeah. So you have a song
stuck in your head.

02:51.552 --> 02:52.818
It happens to everybody.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.887
Well, I'm not everybody.
I have an eidetic memory.

02:54.889 --> 02:57.089
I should be able to remember
what song this is,

02:57.091 --> 02:58.024
but I can't.

02:58.026 --> 02:59.892
Something's wrong with me.

02:59.894 --> 03:02.962
I told you if we were patient,
he'd figure it out for himself.

03:02.964 --> 03:05.698
Oh... I was always afraid
this day would come.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.302
This might be the first step
of my descent into madness,

03:09.304 --> 03:12.938
where I gradually test
the limits of public nudity.

03:13.775 --> 03:14.740
Public nudity?

03:14.742 --> 03:17.977
Eh, that just means
going barefoot.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.887
Hello?
Hi, Dave.

03:27.889 --> 03:29.188
Uh, it's Amy.

03:29.190 --> 03:31.791
Oh. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?

03:31.793 --> 03:34.827
Terrific. And pleasantly
surprised to hear from you,

03:34.829 --> 03:37.363
given how I acted
on our last date.

03:37.365 --> 03:38.397
Yeah, well,

03:38.399 --> 03:39.832
we both made mistakes, you know.

03:39.834 --> 03:42.802
I took the last breadstick,
you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

03:42.804 --> 03:47.006
like he was Leonard Nimoy
and you were my ex-boyfriend.

03:47.008 --> 03:49.375
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

03:49.377 --> 03:51.310
Well, I was wondering

03:51.312 --> 03:54.046
if you'd like to get dinner
again sometime.

03:54.048 --> 03:55.681
Yes, please.

03:55.683 --> 03:58.551
Great.
Let me just check

03:58.553 --> 04:00.353
my schedule, he said,

04:00.355 --> 04:03.189
trying to seem like a man
with things on his schedule.

04:03.191 --> 04:05.491
How 'bout Saturday?

04:05.493 --> 04:06.859
Uh, hmm...

04:06.861 --> 04:08.361
Let me see. Uh, Friday,

04:08.363 --> 04:10.029
farmers' market with Jay Z.

04:10.031 --> 04:13.032
Sunday, piano shopping
with Elton John.

04:13.034 --> 04:14.700
Saturday works.

04:16.838 --> 04:20.339
Oh. Did you know,
at the United Nations,

04:20.341 --> 04:23.042
there's a Department
for Outer Space Affairs?

04:23.044 --> 04:24.643
Really? Why?

04:24.645 --> 04:26.379
They exist
in case we ever make contact

04:26.381 --> 04:27.780
with an alien civilization.

04:27.782 --> 04:31.317
Mm, boy, that's one of those
jobs that's boring, boring,

04:31.319 --> 04:33.119
boring, then, "Oh, God!

04:33.121 --> 04:36.389
Where's the memo
with what we do now?!"

04:37.425 --> 04:39.058
Oh, this is cool.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.427
So, a few weeks ago,
I set up a fan page

04:41.429 --> 04:44.163
on Facebook for our band and...
Wait a second.

04:44.165 --> 04:47.600
How could you do that
without consulting me?

04:47.602 --> 04:48.634
It's not a big deal.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.902
It just took, like,
five minutes to set up.

04:49.904 --> 04:51.504
That's not the point.

04:51.506 --> 04:54.340
When we created
Footprints on the Moon,

04:54.342 --> 04:58.043
we agreed that every band
decision would be mutual.

04:58.045 --> 05:00.346
Now you're just trying to
take over the whole thing.

05:00.348 --> 05:03.783
You know,
maybe I should go solo.

05:03.785 --> 05:05.818
But someone joined
our page.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.787
We have an actual fan.

05:07.789 --> 05:09.688
All right.

05:09.690 --> 05:12.024
This thing's bigger than you
and me-- band's back together.

05:14.162 --> 05:15.594
So, listen to what he wrote.

05:15.596 --> 05:18.397
Uh, "I saw you play
at the comic book store.

05:18.399 --> 05:19.732
You guys rock."

05:19.734 --> 05:22.034
And then there's
a animated smiley face

05:22.036 --> 05:24.236
raising the roof like this...

05:26.174 --> 05:27.740
We did raise the roof
that night.

05:27.742 --> 05:29.375
Yeah, we totally did.
Why do rock stars

05:29.377 --> 05:32.845
do drugs when this feels so great?

05:35.149 --> 05:38.784
♪ Why can't I recall
this song? ♪

05:39.554 --> 05:44.023

you take a break

05:56.871 --> 05:58.537
and do something
else for a while?

05:58.539 --> 06:01.674
There was a project I've
been thinking about starting.

06:01.676 --> 06:02.908
Okay, great. What is it?

06:02.910 --> 06:05.077
I'll show you.

06:07.949 --> 06:10.683
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon,

06:10.685 --> 06:13.018
you were driven mad
by an earworm.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.387
Your mind,
once your most trusted asset,

06:15.389 --> 06:18.357
is now a sack of parrots
and monkeys.

06:18.359 --> 06:19.959
So...

06:19.961 --> 06:21.794
I'm going to tell you
everything you need to know.

06:21.796 --> 06:24.096
Uh, first, music is dangerous.

06:24.098 --> 06:27.333
The movie <i> Footloose</i> tried to
warn us, but we wouldn't listen.

06:27.335 --> 06:30.803
Oh, wait.
♪ Everybody cut footloo... ♪

06:30.805 --> 06:32.304
Nope.

06:32.306 --> 06:36.642
I'll pay $1,000 to watch you
cut footloose.

06:37.512 --> 06:39.678
This is Penny.

06:40.515 --> 06:43.282
She is your friend.

06:43.284 --> 06:45.751
If she offers you food,
it's safe to take it.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.554
You probably
paid for it, anyway.

06:50.725 --> 06:52.758
So, you're really going out
with Dave again?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.993
Why not?

06:53.995 --> 06:55.327
He's actually a very nice guy.

06:55.329 --> 06:57.196
But he spent an entire date

06:57.198 --> 06:59.532
talking about how much
he loves Sheldon.

06:59.534 --> 07:01.667
That's nothing Sheldon
hasn't done before.

07:03.638 --> 07:05.404
Dave's just a big
fan of his work.

07:05.406 --> 07:08.173
Besides, he said he
wouldn't bring it up again.

07:08.175 --> 07:10.409
Okay. So where's he taking you?

07:10.411 --> 07:13.479
Oh, he's coming here.
I'm actually making dinner.

07:13.481 --> 07:15.548
Oh. That's a big step.

07:15.550 --> 07:16.882
It is?

07:16.884 --> 07:19.318
Yeah. You're inviting him
into your home.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.619
It's intimate.

07:20.621 --> 07:23.556
It's where your underpants live.

07:23.558 --> 07:25.891
You know what? Good.

07:25.893 --> 07:29.428
I tried to get back together
with Sheldon; he shot me down;

07:29.430 --> 07:30.829
Dave likes me.

07:30.831 --> 07:33.966
Maybe intimate
is what I need.

07:33.968 --> 07:35.267
You sure?

07:35.269 --> 07:38.003
You've never really been
with a man.

07:38.005 --> 07:42.241
Do you really want to start
with one that's six-foot-seven?

07:42.243 --> 07:44.343
Why not?

07:44.345 --> 07:47.646
'Cause it's like taking
your driver's test in a bus.

07:51.352 --> 07:54.720
Maybe we should post a comment
back to our fan and thank him.

07:54.722 --> 07:56.188
What should we write?

07:56.190 --> 07:58.924
How 'bout, uh...
Oh, how 'bout,

07:58.926 --> 08:00.726
"We might be
Footprints on the Moon,

08:00.728 --> 08:05.297
but your kind words sent
us over the moon."

08:05.299 --> 08:08.867
Someday you're gonna make
an amazing grandma.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.502
What do you
want to write?

08:10.504 --> 08:13.539
Something bad-ass,
you know, like...

08:13.541 --> 08:15.574
"Thanks for diggin' our vibe.

08:15.576 --> 08:17.343
"We'll keep rockin'

08:17.345 --> 08:20.679
if you keep rollin'."

08:20.681 --> 08:22.181
Dude, if I was wearing a bra,

08:22.183 --> 08:24.984
I'd throw it at
your head right now.

08:24.986 --> 08:27.753
I'll keep rockin'.
You don't do that.

08:29.757 --> 08:31.991
Okay. I posted it.

08:31.993 --> 08:33.491
So, who is this guy?

08:33.494 --> 08:37.129
Let's see.
Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

08:37.131 --> 08:39.298
Cool name.
Yeah.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.933
He's 24. He's a deejay.

08:41.936 --> 08:44.135
He brews his own beer.
He's got

08:44.138 --> 08:47.906
awesome tattoos. Dude, he's
got a hot girlfriend, too.

08:47.908 --> 08:52.111
Damn. I don't know if he's
our biggest fan or I'm his.

08:53.714 --> 08:55.881
Hey, Trent just liked
our comment.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.050
He is so cool!

08:58.052 --> 08:59.385
No hard feelings,

08:59.387 --> 09:01.987
but I'm throwing my
hypothetical bra at him.

09:14.268 --> 09:17.569
Oh, my God, he won't stop.

09:17.571 --> 09:21.240
How does he keep coming up
with new ways to be annoying?

09:21.242 --> 09:24.643
Nobody knows.
That's why he's number one.

09:25.946 --> 09:28.047
Can you please go talk
to him?

09:28.049 --> 09:30.883
Come on. I take care of him all
day long. You do it for once.

09:30.885 --> 09:33.952
Once? Who got the gum
out of his hair?

09:33.954 --> 09:37.656
What do you want, a medal?
It was your gum.

09:37.658 --> 09:40.659
Fine.

09:40.661 --> 09:41.794
I love you.

09:41.796 --> 09:43.162
Who cares?

09:45.933 --> 09:47.900
What are you
doing in my room? I...

09:47.902 --> 09:50.769
Stop it! That's mine!

09:50.771 --> 09:53.672
Why are you so strong?!

09:56.310 --> 09:58.410
Problem solved.

10:09.356 --> 10:11.190
Oh, yeah,
he got a tuba.

10:20.562 --> 10:24.564
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon...

10:24.566 --> 10:26.566
this is a thermostat.

10:26.568 --> 10:29.803
It controls the temperature
of the apartment.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.540
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

10:33.542 --> 10:36.576
If you find this too cold,
then put on a jacket.

10:36.578 --> 10:40.413
A straitjacket, 'cause 72's
the best and you're crazy.

10:41.283 --> 10:43.449
Now... this...

10:43.451 --> 10:45.318
is your spot.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.554
You're very protective of it.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.522
When anyone else tries
to sit here,

10:49.524 --> 10:51.457
you berate them relentlessly.

10:51.459 --> 10:55.161
It sounds mean, but
somehow you make it adorable.

10:56.898 --> 10:59.799
People are also delighted
by your love of pranks.

11:00.936 --> 11:03.436
For example, Leonard has no idea

11:03.438 --> 11:04.904
what I did to his coffee.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.175
It wasn't "replace it
with Folger's crystals,"

11:09.177 --> 11:11.211
I'll tell you that much.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.847
Hey, can we please
get back to work?

11:13.849 --> 11:15.548
This is Leonard.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.383
He's your best friend
in the world.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.786
All right, just stop.
This is ridiculous.

11:21.356 --> 11:23.857
Sometimes he gets cranky,

11:23.859 --> 11:26.693
but you can trust him
with your life.

11:26.695 --> 11:30.063
And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.266
Thank you.

11:33.268 --> 11:35.501
Oh, no, he's drinking it.

11:39.741 --> 11:40.940
Look at this.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.776
Trent is rebuilding
a vintage motorcycle.

11:43.778 --> 11:46.512
Hmm.
That is so cool!

11:46.514 --> 11:48.481
Old broken things
are so much better

11:48.483 --> 11:51.584
than new things that work.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.052
Who's Trent?

11:53.054 --> 11:54.287
Oh, he's our fan.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.389
- Fan of what?
- Uh...

11:56.391 --> 11:59.893
Did you forget?
We're in a band.

11:59.895 --> 12:02.629
You mean because you played one
time in the comic book store?

12:02.631 --> 12:06.566
And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

12:06.568 --> 12:08.034
Hey,

12:08.036 --> 12:11.070
dude, Trent just checked in at
the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

12:11.072 --> 12:14.040
Really? You want to go
down there and meet him?

12:14.042 --> 12:16.309
Are you stalking him?
That's creepy.

12:16.311 --> 12:17.677
It's not creepy.

12:17.679 --> 12:20.013
I built a Footprints on the Moon
fan page, Trent joined it.

12:20.015 --> 12:22.048
After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

12:22.050 --> 12:23.549
go back in the archive
of his feed

12:23.551 --> 12:24.984
until I found
his Twitter handle.

12:24.986 --> 12:27.253
From there, it was easy to find
him on Instagram, Snapchat

12:27.255 --> 12:28.788
and pretty much track
his every movement.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.858
So if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

12:32.694 --> 12:34.694
Maybe I should marry Trent.

12:34.696 --> 12:37.897
Yeah, like she
could get Trent.

12:40.735 --> 12:42.101
This is delicious.

12:42.103 --> 12:43.336
Thank you.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.939
Been a long time since
I had a home-cooked meal.

12:45.941 --> 12:48.141
When you were married,
did your wife cook?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.809
Not at first, no.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.412
But when she began cheating
on me with a French chef,

12:52.414 --> 12:54.714
she became quite the wiz
in t kitchen.

12:54.716 --> 12:56.282
So, a little silver lining.

12:56.284 --> 12:57.650
I suppose.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.653
Yeah. Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

13:00.655 --> 13:04.157
like a properly-seasoned
bowl of onion soup.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.793
How long have you,
uh, lived here?

13:06.795 --> 13:08.795
About five years.

13:08.797 --> 13:11.097
I'm actually thinking
of moving to a better place

13:11.099 --> 13:13.466
now that I don't need
to be so close to...

13:13.468 --> 13:14.968
Well, you know.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.869
I do. The brilliant physicist

13:16.871 --> 13:20.139
that I now know lives
in the area, not that I care.

13:20.141 --> 13:22.775
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

13:22.777 --> 13:25.278
so, I pretty much had
to take him everywhere.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.046
<i>Had</i> to or <i> got</i> to?

13:27.048 --> 13:28.214
Sorry.

13:28.216 --> 13:30.717
My fault. I brought him up.
Yeah.

13:30.719 --> 13:32.051
Well, let's change the subject.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.020
No more mentions
of you-know-who.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.755
That's a cool train.

13:35.757 --> 13:37.924
Where did you get that?

13:39.027 --> 13:41.928
♪ Bah, bah, bum-bum,
bah, bum, bum. ♪

13:52.140 --> 13:53.673
This song

13:53.675 --> 13:54.874
is never going to stop.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.409
Have you ever dealt
with something

13:56.411 --> 13:59.012
so relentlessly irritating?

13:59.881 --> 14:03.449
That's a trick
question, right?

14:03.451 --> 14:04.984
Well, I shouldn't
be surprised.

14:04.986 --> 14:06.486
There's a rich history of

14:06.488 --> 14:08.154
brilliant minds
descending into madness.

14:08.156 --> 14:09.655
Come on, Sheldon.

14:09.657 --> 14:12.358
There are plenty of smart people
who don't have mental problems.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.493
Yup, she's right.

14:13.495 --> 14:15.461
For every Newton who had
a psychological issue,

14:15.463 --> 14:17.363
there's an Edison
who was just a jerk.

14:17.365 --> 14:19.766
That could
totally be you.

14:19.768 --> 14:23.636
Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

14:23.638 --> 14:25.204
And Pythagoras had

14:25.206 --> 14:26.873
an irrational fear of beans.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.242
Tesla fell madly in love
with a pigeon

14:29.244 --> 14:32.378
who he claimed loved him back.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.515
Maybe he just had bread
in his pocket.

14:36.851 --> 14:38.785
The list extends
outside of science.

14:38.787 --> 14:41.754
Painters like Van Gogh
and Pollock,

14:41.756 --> 14:43.623
chess champion Bobby Fischer,

14:43.625 --> 14:46.592
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boy...

14:57.505 --> 14:59.038
I remember the song!

14:59.040 --> 15:00.907
It's called
"Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!

15:00.909 --> 15:02.408
Oh, thank goodness!

15:02.410 --> 15:04.811
I'm not crazy!

15:04.813 --> 15:07.480
I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

15:09.784 --> 15:13.052
There goes our shot at
him living on the roof.

15:15.256 --> 15:18.458
So, all right, there he is.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.461
So, should we
introduce ourselves?

15:21.463 --> 15:24.030
No! Let him spot us.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.565
I wonder

15:25.567 --> 15:28.034
if he's listening
to our music right now.

15:28.036 --> 15:29.335
Could you imagine?

15:29.337 --> 15:31.270
What a cool way
for us to meet.

15:31.272 --> 15:34.740
He's playing our song and
looks up, and there we are--

15:34.742 --> 15:38.945
his favorite two-piece acoustic
sci-fi novelty rock band.

15:38.947 --> 15:40.413
And he's, all, like,

15:40.415 --> 15:43.583
"Aren't you the guys from
Footprints on the Moo...?"

15:43.585 --> 15:45.451
Ooh, what is he doing?!

15:48.823 --> 15:50.089
I can't watch.

15:50.091 --> 15:51.691
I-I-It's okay.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.559
Oh, it's okay.
He's done.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.761
Why is he looking at it?!

15:56.831 --> 16:00.199
Eh, no, he's not going
to eat it, is he?

16:00.201 --> 16:01.834
Come on, Trent,
you're better than...

16:06.474 --> 16:09.175
Let's just go.

16:09.177 --> 16:12.211
Hey, aren't you
the guys...?

16:12.213 --> 16:15.281
Nope!
Never heard of 'em!

16:19.387 --> 16:20.820

16:20.822 --> 16:22.722
I wonder why it was
this particular song

16:22.724 --> 16:24.257
that was stuck
in my head.

16:24.259 --> 16:25.958
I don't know.
It's pretty catchy.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.560
Do you even like the Beach Boys?

16:27.562 --> 16:29.529
They have "beach"
right in the name.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.898
What do you think?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.233
Well, now that you can focus
again, what do you say

16:34.235 --> 16:36.169
we get back to surface tension
of domain walls?

16:36.171 --> 16:38.838
Of course. I'm already
seeing a more efficient way

16:38.840 --> 16:41.174
of taming the ultravi...

16:41.176 --> 16:43.609
I know why
the song was in my head.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.179
Why?
It's about Amy.

16:46.181 --> 16:48.548
Okay, look, I know
Amy's like an old lady,

16:48.550 --> 16:50.716
but she's not old enough
to have a song

16:50.718 --> 16:52.818
from the '60s written about her.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.854
It's about
how she made my life better.

16:54.856 --> 16:56.222
Consider the lyrics.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.391
"I was living like half a man.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.860
"Then I couldn't love,
but now I can.

17:00.862 --> 17:02.061
"More soul than

17:02.063 --> 17:03.062
"I ever had.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.631
I love the way
you soften my life."

17:05.633 --> 17:08.568
Well, she did soften your life,
didn't she?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.935
Yes!

17:09.938 --> 17:12.505
She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

17:14.909 --> 17:16.108
I have to go.

17:18.313 --> 17:20.246
Aw.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.882
Am I like the dryer
sheets of your heart?

17:25.118 --> 17:27.553
Better. You're the
lint trap of my love.

17:27.555 --> 17:29.555
Aw.

17:38.066 --> 17:39.732
That's an interesting
tie clip.

17:39.734 --> 17:40.900
Oh, thanks.

17:40.902 --> 17:42.668
It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.571
It's useful for calculating the
number of atoms in a substance,

17:45.573 --> 17:49.475
or causing regret
in anyone who asks about it.

17:49.477 --> 17:50.977
Oh, I...

17:50.979 --> 17:53.646
I think it's neat.

17:53.648 --> 17:55.448
Oh!
Sorry. Sorry.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.416
No one's ever liked
the tie clip before,

17:57.418 --> 18:00.253
so I just lost
all control. I...

18:00.255 --> 18:02.855
No, it... it's okay,
and we are on a date.

18:02.857 --> 18:05.291
I'm... I'm just
a little nervous.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.427
Well, no need
to be nervous with me.

18:08.429 --> 18:11.464
I'm just a harmless giant
from a foreign land.

18:14.402 --> 18:16.636
You know, I'm just
being silly. I...

18:16.638 --> 18:19.372
I don't know what
I'm waiting for.

18:22.043 --> 18:22.942
Amy?

18:22.944 --> 18:24.510
Amy.

18:24.512 --> 18:25.778
Amy?

18:26.848 --> 18:28.881
That's Sheldon.

18:28.883 --> 18:30.983
You're kidding!
How's my hair?

18:36.791 --> 18:39.191
Sheldon, this-this isn't
a good time.

18:39.193 --> 18:40.760
I don't care.

18:40.762 --> 18:43.329
Amy, there was a song I
couldn't get out of my head.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.532
Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

18:46.534 --> 18:51.237
and like that earworm, I can't
get you out of my heart.

18:51.239 --> 18:54.006
So, what I'm trying to say is,

18:54.008 --> 18:57.076
you're my heartworm.

18:58.246 --> 19:02.615
The metaphorical kind, not-not
the poodle-killing kind.

19:02.617 --> 19:04.817
W-W-W-What?

19:04.819 --> 19:06.886
If I may...

19:06.888 --> 19:09.021
I believe
what he's saying,

19:09.023 --> 19:10.790
in a charming
and delightful way,

19:10.792 --> 19:12.792
is that he loves you
and wants you back.

19:12.794 --> 19:14.327
Dave Gibbs,
huge fan of your work.

19:14.329 --> 19:16.162
Oh.
Don't mind me.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.501
I'm-I'm sorry; I didn't
realize you were on a date.

19:22.503 --> 19:25.237
No, it-it... it's okay.
Keep going?

19:25.239 --> 19:27.873
Amy, if you want to be
my girlfriend again,

19:27.875 --> 19:30.242
I really want to
be your boyfriend.

19:30.244 --> 19:33.012
I really want that, too.

19:33.014 --> 19:36.682
Good. Because I love you.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.653
I love you, too.
