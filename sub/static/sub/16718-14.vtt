00:05.560 --> 00:07.120
So far at...

00:07.360 --> 00:09.400
The procedure is called
deep brain stimulation.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.720
Rollie, you did a great job.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.000
You're a doctor, Rollie,
you always will be.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.520
Let me go.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.160
-Will he die?
-No, no way.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.280
Do you want the truth?

00:20.400 --> 00:21.440
Or should I speak as a doctor?

00:21.560 --> 00:23.120
-I want the truth.
-What's your name?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.200
-Ariel.
-Ariel, I'm Dr.  Rorish.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.280
-I am sorry.
-What?

00:26.880 --> 00:27.840
Her father could not be saved.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.120
Be quiet!

00:36.280 --> 00:37.400
Are you ready?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.760
I can get closer if you want

00:42.040 --> 00:43.000
All right.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.920
-Can you hear it?
-Yes.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.480
I can hear you daddy.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.600
I can hear you.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.800
- Cut open, Dr.  Dixon.
-I'm trying.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.680
You have really nice eyes.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.520
What does that mean?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.640
What?

01:11.760 --> 01:13.880
Ma'am, could you just
stay where you are, please?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.320
What was your name again?

01:15.840 --> 01:16.800
Dr.  Dixon.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.240
I just got a text message from
Dr.  Pruitt from the Peterson.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.040
Dr.  Dixon.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.840
Have the wound inspected
in 2 days despite antibiotics.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.560
-Dr.  Dixon.  That sounds nice.
-What did she say?

01:26.680 --> 01:27.680
I do not know.
They are all emojis.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.760
She sweats, is mad and dead?

01:29.880 --> 01:32.320
It says she had a great
day at work and she laughs.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.120
Moment.  Did you write back?

01:35.280 --> 01:36.720
Yes, I invited her
over for coffee.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.800
Not correct.  You said you were
disgusted and you wanted to...

01:41.520 --> 01:42.480
Do not ask.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.560
-For real.
-Oh God.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.640
Give me your cell phone.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.000
A virgin beginner wants
to give me tips for women?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.320
Beautiful eyes, baby.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.840
-Good, let's go.
-Good decision.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.280
Dr.  Dixon.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.200
-Dr.  Willis.
-Jo.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.760
The fire brigade needs a doctor in
the event of a construction site accident.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.200
I do it.  Where do i have to go

02:03.320 --> 02:06.680
Downtown.  Northwest
corner at Olympus Bank.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.800
Do you need help?  I have time.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.800
Here we go.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.120
Dr.  Dixon, go.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.360
What do you have here?

02:13.480 --> 02:15.560
A 14-year-old, severe
burns to her eyes and neck.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.960
My eyes are burning...
I can't see anything.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.480
-What happened?
-Pepper spray.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.960
According to the school, a
genius did it in the heater duct.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.080
-The future of America.
-Stay with me, Kean.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.920
Don't rub your eyes
and don't panic, will you?

02:28.040 --> 02:29.000
Dr.  Dixon, let's go!

02:29.120 --> 02:30.240
Ok what do we have?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.160
A 14-year-old with
a slight sore throat,

02:33.280 --> 02:35.520
Broken thigh on the right,
she was trampled down.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.520
Oh my god it hurts

02:37.640 --> 02:39.800
Calm down, little one.
And hold still.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.120
-Where is Willis?
-Campbell sent him out.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.160
Yet again?
Okay, let's bring her in.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.880
We have to bring them in.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.160
Clean up aisle four.
Guys, come on.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.320
Chief, I heard two of
your men are down.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.040
On the ground?  They are up.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.600
On which floor?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.480
Floor?  They are up there.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.920
On the crane.
The foreman and his brother.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.440
They've been up
there for two hours.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.280
My men can't get it out.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.120
One of them is stuck in the
rope drum and his brother is

03:13.240 --> 03:16.240
being held by the same rope
at the other end of the crane.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.880
DELGADO & SÃ–HNE
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

03:20.800 --> 03:21.840
Family business?

03:22.360 --> 03:23.320
Twenty years so far.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.000
Dad died years ago, the sons
took over and are struggling.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.600
How high do we have to go?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.000
Forty floors.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.800
Are you afraid of heights?

03:35.360 --> 03:36.320
Fear?  Absolutely not.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.680
So are you ready for this?

03:37.880 --> 03:38.840
Why, surely.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.040
It burns so much!

03:43.200 --> 03:44.640
This will help flush your eyes.

03:44.760 --> 03:45.840
Another dose of Dilaudid.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.040
How often do I have to flush?

03:48.160 --> 03:49.120
A few liters.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.320
It does not help.
Please, it hurts!

03:51.440 --> 03:53.920
I take over.  Dr.  Dixon, I need
some soda from the break room.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.000
-What?
-Just get it.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.920
Dr.  Kean, have you ever
straightened a break by train?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.000
I was just watching.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.920
Fine, but I'm warning you.
It won't be nice.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.360
It's time to get her
to the operating room.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.960
-It's okay.
-What are you doing?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.960
We gave you painkillers

04:07.400 --> 04:09.840
but that will hurt, okay?
So please lie still.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.960
Ready?  Dr.  Kean?
Start spinning.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.640
No stop!  It hurts!

04:16.600 --> 04:19.360
I promise, as soon as the bone is
straightened, things will be better.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.600
Go on.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.520
All right.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.280
-They only had this diet...
-Good.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.000
Carbon dioxide and a low pH
level relieve the burning sensation.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.160
It helps!  Thank you.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.880
Watch out, guys,
we'll pass the back.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.680
So what do we have here?

04:38.280 --> 04:41.360
A 54 year old with shortness
of breath, suffering from asthma.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.280
The pepper spray
caused an asthma attack.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.640
Is that Mr. Hazelton?

04:46.640 --> 04:47.720
This is the teacher.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.960
Leighton, please.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.960
Relocate him.  At three.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.680
One two Three.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.920
-Here he comes.
-We have to turn it.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.040
All together, one, two, three.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.520
We got him.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.280
Diffuse inhalation and exhalation.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.680
The saturation falls.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.200
Let's give him albuterol and
ipratropium bromide right now.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.080
And get magnesium
and methylprednisolone.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.400
Folks, the patient
is worse off, go!

05:14.520 --> 05:15.480
I'm already on it.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.560
Oh my God.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.200
Hey hey  You have
to lie down.  Lay down.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
What's going on here?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.040
Nice view.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.200
The wind comes up
every few minutes.  Come.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
What happened?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.840
The rope slipped, the pulley
loosened and buried Jorge.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.280
Rob tried to stop it, it
got caught in the thread.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.160
Robbie?  I am dr
Willis, this is Dr.  Savetti.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.320
We want to help you.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.440
Always check that
you are double secured.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.560
Every 2 m you hang out
and hang yourself in the next.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.280
I wanted to save Jorge.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.320
As we crawled, my arm caught.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.840
Please... go to Jorge.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.200
Please calm down.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.000
OK?  Please take it easy.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.320
-Where is the other one?
-On the thread.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.600
The same cable
caught his brother Jorge,

06:20.720 --> 06:22.160
he is stuck at the
other end of the crane.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.000
-Can you disconnect the cable?
-No, if we loosen it up,

06:28.400 --> 06:30.880
the force of the drum will
pull Robbie into the wind.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.440
We'll see after the brother.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.160
I'll be right back.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.120
Savetti.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.720
How many shifts did you have?

06:47.360 --> 06:48.320
Two.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.920
I am fine.  Let's move on.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.160
Jorge!  What's happening?
Man are you okay

07:02.400 --> 07:05.560
Jorge, I am Dr.  Willis.
This is Dr.  Savetti.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.920
We're here to get you out.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.160
It is so hard.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.560
Listen to me

07:11.680 --> 07:14.200
I know it's hard.
Pay attention to your breathing.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.280
All right?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.920
How is robbie doing

07:17.040 --> 07:19.320
I was told it was
trapped in the drum.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.080
Why don't you get him out?

07:24.680 --> 07:27.120
Keep going.
We'll get you both out.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.000
Can you take the
pressure off this cable?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.880
Just a few centimeters
would be enough.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.360
I need a chain and
a pulley up here.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.480
Save my brother

07:38.640 --> 07:40.320
Jorge?  What's happening?
Are you all right?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.520
Okay, go see him.  I stay here.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.040
Will you give me your radio?

07:48.760 --> 07:49.920
-Savetti?
-Yes.

07:50.440 --> 07:54.080
Come on.  If the cable
becomes tighter, it will split it.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.280
Magnesium and
prednisolone entered.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.360
The wheezing becomes
worse, we have to intubate.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.520
Thank you.  Tube, please.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.160
Yuck, did she just put
that down his throat?

08:17.760 --> 08:18.760
Enter ketamine, please.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.920
Will he get well again?

08:20.040 --> 08:21.240
Please calm down.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.400
The tube is well placed.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
Can someone please tell me
something?  He is my teacher.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.080
Could someone
take them out please?

08:26.400 --> 08:28.520
No... I need to know.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.920
Please keep calm.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.159
The CO2 concentration is
too high, he has acidosis.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.120
Dr.  Dixon, he
needs ventilation.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.520
Watch out, behind you.
It's coming.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.720
-Thank you.
-I have it.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.039
Well he's stable

08:42.440 --> 08:44.360
but he still needs ventilation.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.120
Bring him to the
side area, Dr.  Dixon.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.840
And check his heart.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.680
It doesn't move.
The cable does not move.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.760
Keep trying.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.160
Save my brother and let me die.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.480
We won't do that.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.120
I need to talk to him right away.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.840
Give me your radio, will you?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.120
Robbie?

09:16.880 --> 09:17.880
Robbie can you hear me

09:19.000 --> 09:19.960
Yes.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.560
Everything will be fine.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.040
But what were you
doing here anyway?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.080
You shouldn't even be here.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.960
Robbie?  Robbie?

09:32.800 --> 09:33.840
Willis!

09:33.960 --> 09:34.920
What's happening?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.320
He's passed out.  Come here.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.840
What did he say?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.080
Stay with him, he mustn't move.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.280
Please tell me what's
going on.  You're welcome.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.080
Come on, stay up.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.000
Robbie's pulse went weak.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.480
We have to get him
out of here immediately.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.800
Then we can free the
brother with the drum.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.960
As?  The guy said we
can't disconnect the cable.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.080
We're going to amputate his arm.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.320
What do you have there mama

10:16.440 --> 10:19.840
A 63-year-old woman passed
out with a blunt head injury

10:19.960 --> 10:21.600
and pulsating wound found.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.680
The housekeeper found
her at the bottom of the stairs.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.160
She smells like alcohol.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.640
That's probably why she fell.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.320
Let's do a tox screen
and a CT, please.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.640
-Ready?
-Yes, on three.  One two Three.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.520
-Let's apply it.
-And off.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.600
We made it.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.080
The pupils are the same
size and respond to light.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.640
Jesse, 4.0 on a big needle,
we gotta stop the bleeding.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.720
Come immediately.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.680
Forgiveness.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.160
Dr.  Rorish, this
is Dr.  Blackwell.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.600
He is an orthopedist who
is allowed to treat here.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.480
I did not request an
orthopedic consultation.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.880
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not here.
She is my wife.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
OK.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.240
The cornea was not damaged.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
The pain should go
away soon, and the

11:16.160 --> 11:18.560
medications here
should help your lungs.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.720
In a few hours you will be fine.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.720
What exactly happened?

11:24.120 --> 11:25.920
Someone put pepper
spray down the heater duct.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.000
When the heating was
turned on, it was sprayed.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.200
Heat and chemicals reacted
and that made it worse.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
Dangerous prank.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.880
We all choked.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.880
Everyone pushed past to get out.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.920
And then Mr. Hazelton collapsed.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.800
Why does someone do that?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.360
Because everyone hates him.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.600
He's always doing
surprise tests, and he

11:47.720 --> 11:49.760
gives twice as much
homework as the others.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.840
Last week he confiscated
Olivia and my cell phones

11:52.960 --> 11:55.600
and read the news out loud
in front of the class, right Liv?

11:55.800 --> 11:56.760
Absolutely.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.920
But he'll be fine, right?

12:02.120 --> 12:04.040
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to
reveal anything about other patients.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.800
We need the hacksaw
here immediately!

12:19.920 --> 12:22.840
The way must be clear and the
emergency vehicle must be ready to go.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.160
Are you amputating him up here?
Are you crazy?

12:25.760 --> 12:26.760
We don't have any tools.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.440
Do you have any
other suggestion?

12:29.640 --> 12:31.400
There has to be another way.
Break open the drum?

12:31.520 --> 12:32.920
Too late.  In any
case, he loses his arm.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.280
He will thank us when
he wakes up alive.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.000
Hey you said
everything was fine.

12:48.840 --> 12:49.800
It is.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.880
I hope so.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.080
My hands ached,
so I took paracetamol

12:59.200 --> 13:01.720
and then had some
wine with dinner.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.680
Judith's arthritis
recently flared again.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.600
How long have you been taking
pain medication for your arthritis?

13:07.960 --> 13:11.360
Two... No, three years.
Yes, three years.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.760
-Upon need?
-Yes, as needed.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.480
-Hey, Lily.
-Hi, Dr.  Campbell.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.200
Mom what happened

13:20.360 --> 13:22.920
Your mother got
dizzy climbing stairs.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.000
She hit her head.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
Are you all right?
When can she go home?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.480
All right, Lily.
I'll be fine soon.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.840
Drive up the car.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.880
We need to get an X-ray
and a CT scan before you go.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.160
This can take a few hours.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.640
You can wait in the family
room, it's more cozy there.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.640
No, I want to stay with her.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.040
May I have a moment with you?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.680
Sure, with pleasure.

13:47.920 --> 13:52.360
I would like to take Judith with
me and look after her myself.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.200
She is conscious
but has a serious fall.

13:56.840 --> 13:57.960
I don't want to take any chances.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.000
If I suspect swelling of the
brain, I bring it here immediately.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.560
I know it's hard,

14:03.400 --> 14:04.360
to retire,

14:06.080 --> 14:07.680
but Judith is with Dr. Rorish
in the best of hands.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.280
With all due respect, you are
certainly a very good doctor,

14:11.040 --> 14:14.640
but I would like to look
after them myself, at home.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.040
I have to take good
care of all of my patients

14:19.360 --> 14:21.040
even those who are
married to doctors.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.320
This isn't the first time
this has happened.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.600
We were at a consultation

14:29.280 --> 14:30.360
sent her to rehab.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.080
We're working on it.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.000
That was just a relapse.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.120
You know how easy
it makes the rounds.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.960
I just want to
protect my family.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.240
Will... please?

14:53.840 --> 14:58.200
I understand your concerns,
but am Dr.  Rorish's opinion.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.880
We can't fire her yet.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.960
I'll keep Judith's problems
to myself, I promise.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.640
The school called this
a prank that went wrong.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
I call it a stop.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.000
How long does my father
have to stay on the device?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.840
A few hours to a few days.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.400
We just don't know yet.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.920
He's always had asthma, but
I've never seen him like this.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.120
Usually pepper spray
is quite harmless,

15:30.840 --> 15:32.520
but sometimes it
triggers extreme reactions.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.600
Is that you?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.320
Miss I think you...

15:35.440 --> 15:37.160
All right.  Stay with him.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.760
See what you did, you bitches?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.760
This is my father

15:41.200 --> 15:43.040
and he can no longer
breathe because of you.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.680
I don't know what you think,
but we are the victims here.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.840
Oh, you are victims.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.560
-Ms.  Hazelton.
-You do not even know me.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.880
Right.

15:52.560 --> 15:57.040
Being pretty and popular
doesn't get you anywhere.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.160
And he wants to teach you that

16:00.120 --> 16:01.480
and with that you thank him?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.640
He could have
died because of you.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.800
Ms. Hazelton.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.120
It's understandable that you're
angry, but you can't do that here.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.520
-I am sorry.
-Good.  I go.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.240
Anyway, man.  Or?

16:17.920 --> 16:19.000
Liv?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.520
As soon as we tie off the
vessels, blood stops flowing.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.440
Then we saw through
the bone and get it out.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.160
For how much longer?
This is not doing so great.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.760
We have to work faster.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.160
I cannot reach the deep
arm artery from here.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.520
-Do you need more light, doc?
-Yes.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.440
I can't get it.

16:57.000 --> 16:57.960
I'll get another one for you.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.160
What the fuck are you doing?

17:00.280 --> 17:01.520
I said I would do it.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.520
No!  Damn it!

17:06.079 --> 17:07.119
-Mario!
-Hold on!

17:12.640 --> 17:14.200
-Help!
-Hold on!

17:14.880 --> 17:15.839
Mario!

17:17.280 --> 17:18.240
Are you all right?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.400
This thing cuts off my leg.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.119
Wait a minute, I'll
get a fuse cable.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.520
Okay hold up  I'm coming down.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.400
No, you stay there.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.760
You have to remove the
arm or it will bleed to death.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.560
What are you doing?
We need the cable.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.760
The belt cuts the
blood in his leg.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.200
He'll lose it if he
doesn't get up.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.040
Here, take my hand.
Take my hand

17:44.480 --> 17:45.440
Come.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.040
There.  Connect with the cable.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.080
-OK.
-Okay, we have him.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.680
-Come on!
-And up!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.160
And up!

18:04.440 --> 18:06.440
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.320
Well, we have to hurry.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.840
How long will she have
to walk on the crutches?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.800
A few weeks, then she
will need a little operation.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
Thank you Dr.  Leighton.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.000
Is your mom not here yet?

18:24.920 --> 18:26.080
Emma, â€‹â€‹should we take you with us?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.800
No, that's fine.
She is on her way.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.160
Do you want to
pack up your things?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.120
I'll get the forms ready
for your mother then.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.880
It will take a few more hours.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.440
She's at a party
with my stepfather.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.080
Your daughter in
the emergency room

18:43.200 --> 18:44.920
is probably not a
good reason to miss it.

18:45.640 --> 18:46.600
OK.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.200
Do you need anything else?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.040
No thanks.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.400
Judith Blackwell.
Your CT scan is normal.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.480
Are there any breaks?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.880
Not new, but there, she
has a lot of older fractures.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.880
Her husband said she
had fallen several times.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.160
You mean after a
paracetamol-chardonnay menu?

19:12.520 --> 19:13.480
Dr.  Kean.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.640
I'm sorry.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.360
Wait.  Do you see this here?

19:19.560 --> 19:23.240
This is a spiral fracture on
the spoke that never healed.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.400
-No fall causes such a thing.
-So what?

19:26.520 --> 19:29.600
This is what you get when
the arm is violently broken.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.520
No wonder she's addicted.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.240
-Have you heard from Pruitt?
-Not yet.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.560
It just makes itself scarce.
Do not worry.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.120
Or you screwed it up.
Give me my cellphone

19:44.240 --> 19:46.720
You have to wait at least
2 hours for the message.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.920
Says who?

19:48.120 --> 19:49.680
-All.
-Age, he's right.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.680
Think first, then thumbs.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.640
Thank you.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.920
Dr.  Leighton, something
is wrong with my dad.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.280
Dad?

20:03.360 --> 20:04.480
A circulatory collapse.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.320
Albuterol overstimulated the
heart and caused arrhythmia.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.680
He has to go to the Center Stage.  Come on.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.080
Stop!  Where are you taking him?

20:10.920 --> 20:11.880
Dad!

20:12.000 --> 20:13.840
Stop!
Dad where are you being taken

20:13.960 --> 20:16.080
Miss i'm sorry  You
have to wait outside.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.240
Say he'll get well.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.560
We will let you know as soon
as we know anything new.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.080
What?

20:26.120 --> 20:27.480
Come on, Doc.
You have to hurry up.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.560
Jorge is hardly breathing!

20:30.720 --> 20:32.480
We have to take
that arm off now.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.480
You cut the artery, I
cut through the bone.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.000
He needs to get out of here.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.280
I don't see anything, too much blood.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.360
You have to feel it.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.240
Wait a minute, I
think I feel it.  There.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.400
Through the bone.
Let's get him out.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.760
-Where is this platform?
-Here.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.280
We'll take it over now.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.680
-Do you have him?
-We got him.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.440
I feel a pulse.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.760
Good okay

21:24.520 --> 21:27.040
Get ready to roll up the drum.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.760
Get ready to spin,
then pull it out.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.080
Hold on, Jorge.
We'll get you out of there.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.480
Ready?  Now!

21:38.240 --> 21:39.280
He is released!

21:40.080 --> 21:41.040
And he breathes.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.960
Give me board
and cervical support!

21:43.080 --> 21:45.840
A dramatic nightly rescue
mission at L.A. Heights

21:46.160 --> 21:47.600
came to a head when...

21:47.720 --> 21:51.920
With arthritis, I sometimes
take too much and fall.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.080
Judith, we know it
wasn't you yourself.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.280
It's okay, I'm fine.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.240
Dr.  Kean made
a couple of calls.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.000
You have been to 6 different
emergency rooms for the past 2 years.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.440
That does not concern you.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.520
It is our business if
someone abuses you.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.320
-Even if it's your husband.
-Stop!  Don't say that.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.400
What's going on here?

22:13.560 --> 22:15.400
We're looking after your wife.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.800
Lily, you should take
care of your mother.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.400
I've been on the phone.
What's in it?

22:20.520 --> 22:23.520
All right, honey.
We discussed the treatment.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.160
Not any longer longer.
We go home now.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.440
Dr.  Kean, please
check your values.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.960
What do you think you are doing?
This is my wife.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.840
And she is my patient.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.840
I saw the recordings.
And the emergency rooms.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.280
I told you she was in trouble.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.400
And until I know more,
it's my job to protect them.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.720
I don't feel safe
sending her home.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.360
-And?
-Weak, but there.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.840
Apparent ventricular
tachycardia.  I shock him.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.080
Good, charge up to 100.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.160
Moment.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.240
A moment.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.400
It's ventricular, but
that's Torsade-de-Pointes.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.600
And don't we shock?

23:20.720 --> 23:23.640
We convert.  Put the
defibrillator on a pacemaker.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.000
Turn up the
frequency and energy.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.600
Overdriven pacemaker?

23:27.440 --> 23:30.440
Turn up amps and frequency
until we control the heart.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.360
It works, please.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.320
Press there.  Now
switch down the frequency

23:39.440 --> 23:40.600
and current to end
the tachycardia.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.240
Well, back in the Sinus.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.720
Good work.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.840
Wow.  Well done Dr.  Leighton.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.480
Is there an emoji for that too?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.560
His pulse is weak.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.720
You can hear noises.
An air embolism.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.040
That's what happened
when you saved me.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.840
Robbie!

24:11.960 --> 24:13.560
-How far is it?
-Ten minutes.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.960
Let's put it on its side.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.200
What's happening?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.160
He has air in his
heart.  On the side,

24:18.280 --> 24:19.280
it does not get into
the coronary artery.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.880
What did you do to
my brother, please?

24:21.280 --> 24:23.080
That was the only way
we could save you both.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.200
Oh no oh god

24:28.640 --> 24:30.720
Robbie, come on man.
You can do that.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.520
Listen to me  Don't let him die.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.880
Robbie, wake up.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.880
Have you always
wanted to be a doctor?

24:48.400 --> 24:49.760
That, or a ballet dancer.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.720
But I can't dance, so...

24:52.960 --> 24:54.840
My dad always
wanted me to follow

24:54.960 --> 24:56.600
in his footsteps, but
that didn't work out.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.200
Why not?

25:00.080 --> 25:01.160
I tried,

25:02.800 --> 25:04.440
But nothing I did
was ever good enough

25:05.760 --> 25:08.480
And then my mom
stopped doing it.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.320
He's so controlling,
you have no idea.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.520
Then tell me.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.840
Everyone thinks he's
such an important surgeon,

25:21.960 --> 25:24.480
but they have no
idea what he really is.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.080
Just because he gives
me money, he thinks I'm his.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.840
Sometimes I wish he was dead.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.040
Lily,

25:33.800 --> 25:38.000
if your dad hurt you
or your mom, tell us.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.760
Lily, stop that.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.320
That's enough.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.440
Are you still here?

26:05.560 --> 26:07.000
The others are all gone.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.920
My mom is still at
that stupid party.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.600
I saw you take
Mr. Hazelton into this room.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.240
He's fine, right?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.320
You didn't seem to care before.
What's different now?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.320
I didn't say I don't
care. I am not a monster.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.320
Whoever it was
didn't want to hurt him.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.800
No?  What did they think
was going to happen?

26:31.320 --> 26:33.480
At least not.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.000
He'll get well again.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.840
Good.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.720
But he went through a lot today.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.960
He hated us before,
now he'll really hate us.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.760
And how do you feel?

26:50.880 --> 26:51.880
Because of Mr. Hazelton?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.960
As for yourself.
You said he hates you.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.400
I just wondered
how you see yourself

26:57.920 --> 26:59.560
I?  I'm okay

27:00.560 --> 27:02.240
And dude, you're a
nurse, not a psychologist.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.960
I don't have to be a
psychologist to see what I see.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.560
And what do you think you see?

27:08.440 --> 27:12.960
A nice girl named
Emma who is in a fight.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.280
You think I'm having a
fight with Mr. Hazelton?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.200
No, but with the other Emma

27:18.960 --> 27:20.520
the ones you don't like very much.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.320
I think you can beat her.

27:25.320 --> 27:28.400
You just have to choose
who you want to be.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.720
None of this is proven.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.240
But there are clues.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.880
I've known Ross for 20 years.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.840
When her daughter had problems

27:53.960 --> 27:55.240
at school, I helped find help.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.080
God I let the guy
operate on my daughter

27:59.560 --> 28:00.760
so much do i trust him.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.400
But nobody knows what's
going on behind closed doors.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.480
You know that
better than anyone.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.880
Judith is addicted.
It could have been herself.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.240
Maybe she became addicted
because her husband beat her.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.520
Dr.  Rorish, quick, it's
about the Blackwells.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.000
-Judith?
-No, Dr.  Blackwell.

28:25.880 --> 28:26.880
What happened?

28:27.000 --> 28:27.960
Probably a stroke.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.120
He was at Judith's bed,
he talked strangely and fell.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.120
Ross, can you answer me?

28:32.760 --> 28:33.720
He has aphasia.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.240
Ross, squeeze my fingers.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.840
And on the right he is weak.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.120
A carotid dissection.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.480
That explains the
stroke symptoms.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.280
Blood clots.
It went straight to the brain.

28:45.920 --> 28:46.960
Look at these wounds.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.320
He was hit.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.680
That probably caused
the aortic dissection.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.160
His neck must have
tilted back somehow.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.680
Do we give him tPa?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.640
In the event of injury, it is
risky to give it peripherally.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.120
We could put it in the
artery at the edge of the clot.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.360
Yes that is a good idea.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.280
Let's get him up to radiology.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.000
I do not understand that.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.320
A few minutes ago he was fine.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.600
The injury can be
a day or two old.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.920
Maybe it happened
while fighting with Judith.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.080
She couldn't possibly
have hit him back that hard.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.400
Not with this force.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.880
Maybe he wasn't
arguing with her.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.960
Maybe he defended her.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
What happened?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.600
A 32 year old with a
suspected air embolism.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.200
He suffered cardiac
arrest on the way.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.520
Robbie!

29:43.280 --> 29:45.840
Robbie!  Please don't die!

29:46.920 --> 29:48.120
We need a central
venous catheter.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.680
-Take him to bed two.
-All right.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.440
Put the catheter to the
heart, we suck the air out.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.440
Ready?  One two Three!

29:58.240 --> 29:59.440
Ready to turn.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.600
There you are.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.400
That's it

30:08.160 --> 30:09.440
He has ventricular fibrillation.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.520
Give him amiodarone.

30:10.680 --> 30:11.680
Yes doctor

30:18.280 --> 30:19.440
Is everything ok?

30:19.560 --> 30:20.920
Yes I'm fine.  So.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.040
You must go.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.160
No I'm fine.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.960
Go to sleep.  That is an order.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.640
Katether is inside.  Dr.
Leighton.  Prepare the syringe.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.560
No air bubbles.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.640
Once again.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.400
Ok i got it

30:52.520 --> 30:53.560
The blood pressure rises.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.920
Well, let's put him on his back.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.400
Well done Dr.  Leighton.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.040
Where is she?  Where is my mom

31:22.240 --> 31:23.960
-In a private room.
-Where is he?

31:24.840 --> 31:26.560
-I can't tell you that.
-I can find her alone.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.200
Hey  Hey

31:33.040 --> 31:34.720
The CT room is
one of the few rooms

31:34.840 --> 31:36.480
where we have
surveillance cameras here.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.640
What's this?

31:38.560 --> 31:40.040
Why can't Lily see us?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.520
Look at.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.520
Turn that off.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.560
No, I think you should see this.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.400
I said turn it off.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.560
How long has it been going on?

32:05.320 --> 32:06.560
You do not understand this.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.800
She doesn't want to hurt us.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.040
It's our fault, we spoiled her.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.480
I know my parents are in there.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.360
At the bar I was told
where she was.  I want in.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.440
Lily, stop it.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.600
Get out of here.
I want to go to my parents.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.360
You will never see
your parents alone again.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.640
No... I... I have to see you.

32:25.960 --> 32:26.960
Please, Will.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.800
It's a family matter.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.520
Lily, please come here.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.160
We know you hurt them.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.360
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.440
Was it the money?

32:37.560 --> 32:38.840
-No.
-Would you like to cut the money?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.440
I contacted the
hospital attorney.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.520
He will help you
with an injunction.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.480
Ross, tell him he's wrong!

32:44.600 --> 32:46.000
You are not allowed to
protect them any further.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.120
Shut up.
You can't prove anything.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.400
Yes, we can.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.840
You both need help.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.360
She doesn't mean it.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.040
Judith, stop it.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.840
It's over.
It doesn't go on like this any longer.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.160
No, I want...
I want to see her.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.520
No no.  Mom!

33:03.640 --> 33:05.720
Mom, they're taking me.  Mom!

33:06.480 --> 33:08.560
She made life hell for us.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.120
She is our child.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.200
Mom!  Mom!

33:11.320 --> 33:13.000
-I am sorry.
-You're welcome!  Help me!

33:16.640 --> 33:17.960
Mom!

33:20.600 --> 33:21.640
Judith...

33:35.640 --> 33:38.800
He's been on a lot of pain
medication so he's a little confused.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.800
Hi.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.520
Hey

33:58.800 --> 34:00.920
I should never have
let you on the crane.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.880
Nobody is to blame.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.199
Remember the first
day we started with Dad?

34:22.840 --> 34:24.159
The old man just didn't stop.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.239
He showed off because his
boys followed in his footsteps.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.600
And then he invited
everyone for a beer.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.040
But he had forgotten his wallet.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.440
And we had to pay.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.560
Right.  And we divided it up.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.800
I'm sure Dad knew
exactly what he was doing.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.320
No...

34:46.520 --> 34:47.960
This time we don't share.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.239
It's your turn, brother.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.960
Half a man cannot run a company.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.640
If I tear off your other arm

35:00.000 --> 35:02.400
would you still be a
bigger man than all of us

35:03.920 --> 35:05.000
even than me.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.240
We make it...

35:11.360 --> 35:12.440
Together.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.240
Are you in?

35:28.960 --> 35:29.920
Yes.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.360
Count me in.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.600
Good news, his
oxygenation is going well.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.440
Mr. Hazelton, someone
wants to see you.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.160
What are you doing here

35:51.560 --> 35:53.240
Nevermind.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.320
Emma, â€‹â€‹wait.  You're welcome.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.120
Can Emma and I be
alone for a moment?

36:01.640 --> 36:02.720
It's okay.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.080
I'll take you to the waiting room.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.320
Good to see you're
better, Ms. Easton.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.080
You were probably
worse off than me.

36:17.640 --> 36:18.720
Just a little.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.040
Do you have any
idea who that was?

36:22.880 --> 36:23.840
No.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.560
I just wanted to
see if you were okay.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.920
We don't have to hold a meeting
right away because of that.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.560
Out of curiosity.
You don't know who it

36:30.680 --> 36:32.280
was, but maybe you
know why it was done.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.480
I dont know.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.280
Maybe you could be
nicer to your students.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.760
That's the problem?
That i'm not nice

36:39.360 --> 36:42.400
Who that was must have
thought you weren't nice.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.720
Maybe you think I'm not nice

36:45.120 --> 36:46.200
Do not know what I am thinking.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.280
You don't know anything about me.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.720
You like emily dickinson

36:53.560 --> 36:54.960
but Wordsworth does not.
I know that.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
What?

36:57.680 --> 37:00.760
You know a lot about 19th
century English literature.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.920
You are not the
hardest working student,

37:04.040 --> 37:06.360
you focus too much
on your social life.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.320
But there are moments when
your mind and your imagination

37:12.320 --> 37:13.720
are simply magical.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.320
I doubt it.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.920
I'm sorry, Mr. Hazelton.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.840
It was me. I did this to you.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.960
I am so sorry.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.640
Emma, â€‹â€‹it's good.  Come here.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.280
You made a mistake.
We all do that.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.480
"In the end, Pip realizes
that his 'great expectations'

37:54.880 --> 38:00.080
did not concern the world;
what he needed was in him. "

38:02.560 --> 38:03.680
This is from my book review.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.720
Yes that's true.

38:06.960 --> 38:10.040
As I said, lovely.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.800
Hey, look, we did it.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.520
Read.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.840
What?  What is she saying?

38:28.280 --> 38:30.880
Dr.  Pruitt says she would
love to go hiking with you.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.360
-Hike?
-Yes.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.560
That should be
a coffee invitation.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.800
I am not a wanderer.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.920
I look silly in shorts, I
don't even have boots.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.800
That's a catastrophe.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.480
-Are you going home at last?
-Yes.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.600
Do you know what
your problem is, Savetti?

39:03.080 --> 39:05.440
You are good but want to show
everyone that you are great.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.640
Do you know the
difference between things?

39:10.240 --> 39:13.600
No idea.
Brains, talent, courage?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Knowing your limits.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.040
The step from cowboy
to idiot is not great.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.200
I've seen this in
action all the time.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.840
The best soldiers
risk the most, but it's

39:21.960 --> 39:24.080
also the ones who
wear their body armor.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.480
I'll remember that for the next
time I hang around the crane.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.240
I'm serious.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.880
You are about
to be really great.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.560
Try to be less stupid.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.360
And then I'll send the rest.

39:50.480 --> 39:51.960
-Hey, Rollie.
-Hey, Leanne.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.760
Do you miss us

39:54.880 --> 39:56.200
I'm here for my final check-up.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.200
I'll be back in a few
days on medical advice.

39:58.400 --> 40:02.480
You look great.  You have all
your hair again.  Congratulations.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.000
They're still a
bit gray, but I'm

40:04.120 --> 40:05.440
pleased with the compliment.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.680
Dr.  Rorish?
do you remember me?

40:11.760 --> 40:12.760
Ariel?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.880
Can I talk to you alone?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.640
For sure.  Are you
here with your aunt

40:22.160 --> 40:23.320
No, I came by bus.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.680
From Minnesota?

40:26.160 --> 40:27.200
From New Mexico.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.360
Okay, come this way.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.560
Who is this?

40:38.880 --> 40:39.960
She was a patient.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.160
She and her father had
an accident and he died.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.160
What is she doing here now?

40:47.200 --> 40:48.520
I have no idea.
