00:03.270 --> 00:06.189
Coffee to go, please.

00:06.189 --> 00:07.065
Adam?

00:07.065 --> 00:08.025
Oh, hey, guys.

00:08.025 --> 00:08.983
How's it going?

00:08.983 --> 00:09.901
Ah, I'm tired.

00:09.901 --> 00:11.111
I haven't gotten any sleep

00:11.111 --> 00:12.695
since I moved in with Jennifer.

00:12.695 --> 00:15.073
All right.
Up top, brother.

00:15.073 --> 00:16.533
No, it's--it's not that.

00:16.533 --> 00:17.825
The problem is
her tiny bed.

00:17.825 --> 00:20.828
There's no space.
That girl's all
knees and elbows.

00:20.828 --> 00:23.623
Get a bigger bed.
We've had one
for ten years.

00:23.623 --> 00:24.791
We're like boxers.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.209
When we're done mixing it up,

00:26.209 --> 00:29.171
we like to go
to our own corners.

00:29.754 --> 00:33.007
And the rounds never last
more than three minutes.

00:33.007 --> 00:34.301
If you want more
than three minutes,

00:34.301 --> 00:38.846
then be ready
more than three minutes
before Sports Center.

00:39.639 --> 00:43.185
Or be willing
to face that direction.

00:43.185 --> 00:44.102
Hey.

00:44.102 --> 00:45.145
Record Sports Center.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.313
You won't have to rush.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.816
I work better
with a deadline.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.318
He does.

00:51.318 --> 00:55.697
Uh, I'll think about
that bigger bed thing.

00:57.615 --> 00:59.576
Apple pie
for breakfast?

00:59.576 --> 01:00.910
Here's my thinking
on that.

01:00.910 --> 01:03.246
You'd be fine
if I ordered
apple Danish

01:03.246 --> 01:07.041
which is basically
flat apple pie.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.961
Good use
of your brain.

01:11.254 --> 01:12.880
Oh, whoa.

01:13.756 --> 01:14.382
What?

01:14.382 --> 01:16.801
Hey, Audrey.
Magilla.

01:16.801 --> 01:18.178
Russell.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.762
This is my new friend,
Dani.

01:19.762 --> 01:21.973
Dani, this is Jeff,
Audrey.

01:21.973 --> 01:23.641
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:23.641 --> 01:24.892
- Pleasure's mine.
- Hello.

01:24.892 --> 01:28.313

he's a gentle giant.
Don't be afraid.

Good stuff, Russell.
Good stuff.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.277
Well, I am going to
meet you at the table

01:34.277 --> 01:37.239
'cause I have to go to
the little girl's room.

01:37.239 --> 01:39.073
Ooh, okay.

01:41.409 --> 01:42.244
Russell...

01:42.244 --> 01:45.580
Is it bring your daughter
to work day already?

01:45.580 --> 01:46.664
No, but I get it.

01:46.664 --> 01:50.210
Hey, guess what.
She's a lifeguard.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.462
Lucky drowning victims.
How old is she?

01:52.462 --> 01:55.923
Don't you mean
how old isn't she?

01:55.923 --> 01:57.259
[LAUGHS]

01:57.259 --> 01:58.009
Just kidding.

01:58.009 --> 01:59.927
But seriously,
call Jack Bauer

01:59.927 --> 02:02.639
because she's 24.

02:02.639 --> 02:05.142
24? Whoa.

02:05.142 --> 02:06.351
Sit down and eat, Jeff.

02:06.351 --> 02:08.853
How old now.
How'd you do that?

02:08.853 --> 02:11.273
How'd a guy your age
pull that off?

02:11.273 --> 02:12.274
Age is not an issue.

02:12.274 --> 02:15.152
Mostly because
I lie about it.

02:15.152 --> 02:16.986
It's a good system.

02:16.986 --> 02:20.198
You may possibly
be my new hero.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.033
Hey, I'm flattered.

02:22.033 --> 02:26.078
Listen, I gotta go
read the menu to Dani.
See ya.

02:26.078 --> 02:28.206
Ah, you keep up
the good work, Dani.

02:28.206 --> 02:33.545
Lifeguards are the doctors
of our beaches.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.842
Okay, we're good.
Beat it.

02:39.842 --> 02:41.344
Okay.

[SIGHS]

02:44.138 --> 02:46.057
Where's my pie?

02:46.057 --> 02:48.560
You're warming it.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.608
And now it's a Danish.

03:02.824 --> 03:03.408
Sorry.

03:03.408 --> 03:07.454
I don't think
I deserved a pant load
of apple pie.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.206
Uh, you did.

03:09.206 --> 03:11.123
I can't believe you--

03:11.123 --> 03:13.835
Is that crust
on your face?

03:15.086 --> 03:17.922
You ate the butt pie?

03:19.006 --> 03:20.842
It was paid for.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.888
Look, I don't expect you
not to find other women
attractive,

03:25.888 --> 03:29.601
but is our relationship
at a point where you
feel comfortable

03:29.601 --> 03:30.727
doing it in front of me?

03:30.727 --> 03:32.895
All right, you're right.

03:32.895 --> 03:34.146
I was pretty rude.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.607
And I'm sorry.

03:35.607 --> 03:37.609
And just so you know,

03:37.609 --> 03:40.111
you don't have to worry.

03:40.111 --> 03:44.156
I would never leave you
for a 24 year old.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.158
[SNORTS LAUGHTER]

03:47.285 --> 03:48.370
Thank you.

03:48.370 --> 03:50.538
That is a load
off my mind.

03:50.538 --> 03:53.875
- You're being sarcastic.
- I am.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.669
Because you don't think
I can attract a 24 year old.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.963
Not even if you
were wearing a suit

03:58.963 --> 04:01.132
made out of Justin Timberlake.

04:01.132 --> 04:04.386
You're forgetting
you were 24

04:04.386 --> 04:06.263
when you fell for my charms.

04:06.263 --> 04:06.929
Oh, your charms?

04:06.929 --> 04:08.890
When I first saw you,
you were screaming

04:08.890 --> 04:11.268
at a girl
for over pumping the keg.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.561
It was gonna be
all foam!

04:13.561 --> 04:14.812
You know what...

04:14.812 --> 04:16.273
you believe what you want
to believe.

04:16.273 --> 04:19.609
You're just lucky
there's no way
we can prove it.

04:19.609 --> 04:21.278
Maybe there is.

04:21.278 --> 04:23.363
What are you talking about?

04:23.363 --> 04:24.906
I'll give you one night.

04:24.906 --> 04:26.408
Go out,
take off your wedding ring,

04:26.408 --> 04:28.618
and try to get
a young girl's phone number.

04:28.618 --> 04:31.329
You do not want me
to call your bluff.

04:31.329 --> 04:32.204
Oh, I'm not bluffing.

04:32.204 --> 04:35.458
But if you don't want
to embarrass yourself
by trying,

04:35.458 --> 04:36.668
I would totally
understand.

04:36.668 --> 04:39.045
Let's make it a bet.
What are we playing for?

04:39.045 --> 04:42.924
There, uh,
should be something at stake.

04:42.924 --> 04:44.676
Oh, something is.

04:44.676 --> 04:45.343

never lost that before.

What do you think?

05:21.463 --> 05:23.548
A new queen size bed.

05:23.548 --> 05:27.427
Oh, this is great!
I thought we couldn't
afford one.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.177
We can't.

05:28.177 --> 05:30.555
It's my old bed.
I got it out of storage.

05:30.555 --> 05:33.433
Wow. I forgot
how comfortable it is.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.935
Yeah. You know
when we got it,

05:35.935 --> 05:37.687
Sonia wanted
to get the cheaper one,

05:37.687 --> 05:41.148
but I convinced her
to go top of the line.

05:42.149 --> 05:44.235
Pretty smart, huh?

05:44.235 --> 05:46.404
Sonia?

or do other things

05:55.455 --> 05:57.665
in a bed you bought
with your ex.

05:57.665 --> 05:58.416
Honey, you already have.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.710
But I didn't know it then.
That was when we were dating.

06:00.710 --> 06:04.381
Now we're engaged, and this is
our apartment-- this can't be
our bed.

06:04.381 --> 06:08.468
Come on, I'm not
getting any sleep
in the little bed.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.970
The little bed
is killing me.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.389
I'm sorry, Adam.
It needs to go.

06:12.389 --> 06:15.392
Why? You didn't have a problem
with the chair I brought over.

06:15.392 --> 06:19.646
That's because you and Sonia
didn't have sex on it.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.898
Okay, the chair goes, too.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.858
Come on, Jennifer.

06:23.858 --> 06:25.443
Look, I know
it's irrational.

06:25.443 --> 06:26.861
But every time
I got into that bed

06:26.861 --> 06:29.906
I'd feel like Sonia
was in it with us.

06:32.950 --> 06:33.701
Really?

06:33.701 --> 06:37.329
What? No, I was just
thinking about...

you're so pretty.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.583
Look, let's just
buy a new bed.

06:40.583 --> 06:45.588
No, no. When we got engaged,
we agreed we wouldn't start
our life together in debt.

We don't need
that pressure.

gonna do?

06:59.351 --> 07:00.019
Why am I secure?

deal with Sonia in your bed,

07:02.730 --> 07:06.901
but you're fine
with all the guys
who've been in mine.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.950

10:07.665 --> 10:09.291
One last chance
to call it off.

10:09.291 --> 10:12.169
No, no. I don't want
to call it off.

10:12.169 --> 10:13.129
Why? Do you?

10:13.129 --> 10:16.548
Does this answer your question?

10:22.513 --> 10:25.182
I'm gonna need some butter.

10:32.356 --> 10:33.232
Hi.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.067
Hi. I'm Jeff.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.319
I'm Beth.
I like your shirt.

10:37.319 --> 10:41.532
Oh, thanks.
My wife bought it
for me.

10:41.532 --> 10:43.367
Um, hold on, hold on.

10:43.367 --> 10:44.576
I...when...

10:44.576 --> 10:47.371
When I said wife,
uh...

10:47.371 --> 10:49.749
I meant my dead wife.

11:00.134 --> 11:02.219
Hi.

11:06.515 --> 11:08.350
I'm back.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.018
Whatcha doin'?

11:09.018 --> 11:11.437
Still designing
the sales brochures

11:11.437 --> 11:12.479
for those condos--look.

11:12.479 --> 11:15.316
I don't like the way
we left things before.

11:15.316 --> 11:16.233
Bup--bup--bup.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.610
I've decided
nothing happened before.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.988
We have a clean slate,
and to start...

11:20.988 --> 11:24.784
I have Chinese food
and a movie.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.119
Oh. Okay, I like it.

11:27.119 --> 11:27.870
What movie did you get?

11:27.870 --> 11:30.915
-Sideways.
- Oh, good, I love that one.

11:31.582 --> 11:33.500
- You've seen it?
- Uh-huh.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.626
Really? With who?

11:34.626 --> 11:37.629
One of the guys?
One of the little bed guys?

11:37.629 --> 11:38.798
What happened
to a clean slate?

11:38.798 --> 11:41.550
You would
love a clean slate,
wouldn't you.

11:41.550 --> 11:42.885
It was your idea.

11:42.885 --> 11:43.427
Why "all"?

11:43.427 --> 11:45.763
Why'd you have to say
"all the guys"?

11:45.763 --> 11:46.597
It's a figure of speech.

11:46.597 --> 11:49.475
Neither one of us
should have to apologize
for our pasts.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.603
Why did you make me
get rid of the Sonia Bed
and chair?

11:52.603 --> 11:56.148
Okay. You're right.

11:57.024 --> 11:58.525
How about this?

11:58.525 --> 12:01.320
I made you
get rid of two things
from your past,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.447
so I'll get rid of
two from mine.

12:03.447 --> 12:07.118
A picture from my trip
to Mexico with Jason.

12:07.118 --> 12:10.621
The cookbook
with the first recipe
I made for Michael.

12:10.621 --> 12:11.873
Both gone.

12:11.873 --> 12:13.457
Now we're even.

12:13.457 --> 12:17.544
Not...really.

12:17.544 --> 12:19.756
I mean, Jason and Michael.

12:19.756 --> 12:23.009
That's two relationships
to my one. So...

12:23.801 --> 12:28.139
The guide book
I took to Barbados
with Ann.

12:28.139 --> 12:29.473
Now we're even.

12:29.473 --> 12:31.267
No.

12:31.267 --> 12:34.145
Now it's three items
to two.

12:34.145 --> 12:35.855
So...

12:37.273 --> 12:40.151
From Nick
on Valentine's Day.

12:40.151 --> 12:41.861
Three all.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.612
Okay.

12:43.612 --> 12:45.948
You wanna rumble?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.452
This sexy, sexy
mix CD

12:50.452 --> 12:55.457
made for me by Cindy
for our third anniversary
trip to Nantucket.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.584
Where we had sex!

13:05.885 --> 13:07.678
Steven.

13:07.678 --> 13:09.638
Josh.

13:09.638 --> 13:11.891
Alejandro.

13:13.392 --> 13:16.728
I'm gonna go roll around
in the Sonia Bed.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.278
You, uh, put that
on my tab.

13:24.278 --> 13:26.655
Cheers.

13:28.532 --> 13:29.909
I enjoy a cocktail.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.328
I like a drink,
and I enjoy drinking it.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.913
Big drinker.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.415
You're welcome.
You enjoy that.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.419
Hey, how's it going
old man?

13:40.419 --> 13:41.921
What are you doing here?

13:41.921 --> 13:42.713
I wouldn't miss this.

13:42.713 --> 13:45.799
Hey, I'm a big drinker.
I'm actually a drunk.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.801
Hey, where ya going?

13:47.801 --> 13:49.386
That stuff's gold.

13:49.386 --> 13:52.556
I'm a little rusty.
It's still early.

13:52.556 --> 13:54.475
It's later than you think.

13:54.475 --> 13:55.017
Ladies!

13:55.017 --> 13:58.896
Check it out.
Here comes Plan B.

13:58.896 --> 13:59.396
Hi.

13:59.355 --> 14:01.732
Hi, you must be Jeff.
I'm Tawney.

14:01.732 --> 14:02.483
Hello, Tawney.

14:02.483 --> 14:05.069
Yeah, Tawney's
one of Dani's
little buddies.

14:05.069 --> 14:08.030
Russell said
you used to live
with George Clooney.

14:08.030 --> 14:10.657
Russell and I
need to talk.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.785
Two seconds.
Two seconds.

14:13.785 --> 14:14.370
[LAUGHS]

14:14.370 --> 14:16.663
- She a hooker?
- You gonna have sex with her?

14:16.663 --> 14:18.832
- No.
- Then she's not a hooker.

14:18.832 --> 14:21.252
You say you're friends
with George Clooney,

14:21.252 --> 14:22.920
you get a phone number--
real simple.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.214
You think you have
to lie to get a number?

14:25.214 --> 14:29.218
I've been watching you.
You do.

14:29.218 --> 14:30.552
Don't you want
to prove Audrey wrong?

14:30.552 --> 14:34.515
This is not about proving
to Audrey. It's about
proving to myself.

14:34.515 --> 14:37.309
Am I past my prime?
Have I lost it?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.852
Yes and yes.

14:38.852 --> 14:41.939
All right.
I'll be with the girls.

14:49.906 --> 14:50.990
I just don't know
what to do.

14:50.990 --> 14:55.036
I mean neither of us
can change what we did
before we met.

14:55.036 --> 14:55.536
Yeah.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.788
You know, most people
deal with this stuff

14:57.788 --> 14:59.040
before they get engaged.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.085
You guys just dove in
after seven months.

15:03.085 --> 15:05.587
Are you pregnant?

15:05.587 --> 15:07.673
- No.
- It's okay if you are.

15:07.673 --> 15:11.135
Just don't tell anyone
I gave you wine.

15:11.135 --> 15:12.344
I'm not pregnant.

15:12.344 --> 15:15.847
I just don't want
our insecurities
to mess things up.

15:15.847 --> 15:17.141
I mean, Adam's the one.

15:17.141 --> 15:20.102
And I had to chase him
for a while.

15:20.102 --> 15:21.228
[LAUGHS]

15:21.228 --> 15:22.354
Jeff pursued me.

15:22.354 --> 15:27.193
'Course I was carrying
a three foot party sub
at the time so...

15:27.193 --> 15:30.446
Did you guys have problems
dealing with your past?

15:30.446 --> 15:31.613
Yeah, a little at first.

15:31.613 --> 15:33.699
But the longer
you're with someone,

15:33.699 --> 15:34.783
the stuff just fades away.

15:34.783 --> 15:38.704
Yeah. I just have
to get Adam to see that.

15:38.704 --> 15:39.455
Yeah.

15:39.455 --> 15:42.041
I wish we were
secure as you and Jeff.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.292
Well, don't
get too secure.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.086
Then you start
taking your wife for granted

15:45.086 --> 15:48.797
by drooling over some
24 year old right
in front of her.

15:48.797 --> 15:55.012
So you sent him to a bar
without his wedding ring
to hit on young girls.

15:55.012 --> 15:56.973
Yep.
[LAUGHS]

15:56.973 --> 15:59.183
Guess you showed him.

15:59.183 --> 16:01.393
I am not worried.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.187
Jeff's a good looking guy.

16:03.187 --> 16:07.483
In a statue on Easter Island
kinda way.

16:07.984 --> 16:09.901
Plus, he's kind of
a doofus.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.279
He walks around
singing Huey Lewis songs.

16:12.279 --> 16:13.655
And the man can't
brush his teeth

16:13.655 --> 16:17.118
without putting
his other hand
down his shorts.

16:17.618 --> 16:19.536
Then as long as he's
down at that bar

16:19.536 --> 16:21.038
singing and brushing
his teeth,

16:21.038 --> 16:23.749
you have nothing
to worry about.

16:32.299 --> 16:35.469
Ten minutes, and she
hasn't even maced him.

16:35.469 --> 16:38.347
The old veteran
might still have it.

16:38.347 --> 16:39.973
You know who
he reminds me of?

16:39.973 --> 16:41.725
The 1977 World Series.

16:41.725 --> 16:44.228
Reggie Jackson hit
three home runs.

16:44.228 --> 16:46.147
I was there.

16:46.147 --> 16:47.564
Wow!

16:47.564 --> 16:51.568
Wait a second,
you weren't even born then.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.988
You know what,
you're right.

16:54.988 --> 16:56.240
You caught me.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.659
It's time to come clean.

16:58.659 --> 17:00.661
I was not there.

17:01.995 --> 17:05.041
So this is your email,
your web address,
your screen name.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.709
- Have a phone number?
- I don't give it out.

17:07.709 --> 17:08.377
I'm sort of private.

17:08.377 --> 17:12.881
But you seem
like a nice guy so, okay.

17:22.224 --> 17:23.892
Hi, is this seat taken?

17:23.892 --> 17:25.519
No.

17:25.519 --> 17:27.896
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.649
Feel like buying a girl
a drink?

17:30.649 --> 17:31.900
Well, sure.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.362
What's a lady like you
doing in a place like this?

17:35.362 --> 17:38.074
Oh, I had a fight
with my husband.

17:38.074 --> 17:39.533
He was sort of
being a jerk.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.827
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.538
He met this 24 year old slut--

17:44.538 --> 17:47.749
We don't know
she's a slut.

17:47.749 --> 17:49.293
She's a lifeguard.

17:49.293 --> 17:52.296
Are all lifeguards sluts?

17:52.296 --> 17:54.756
I'm doing a thing.
All right.

17:54.756 --> 17:56.592
As I was saying...

17:56.592 --> 18:00.429
My husband
carried on about her
right in front of me

18:00.429 --> 18:01.680
like I wasn't even there.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.515
It made me feel
taken for granted.

18:03.515 --> 18:06.560
Well, my wife thought
she was the only one

18:06.560 --> 18:09.355
who could ever
find me attractive.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.233
It made me
feel taken for granted.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.736
She shouldn't
have done that.

18:16.903 --> 18:19.531
He shouldn't have either.

18:26.913 --> 18:28.249
Wanna go back to my place?

18:28.249 --> 18:30.834
What kinda girl
do you think I am?

18:30.834 --> 18:32.669
I'm hoping lifeguard.

18:32.669 --> 18:37.758
Well, you know they are
the doctors of our beaches.

18:38.884 --> 18:42.053
By the way,
get anybody's number?

18:42.053 --> 18:45.391
Just yours.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.775
Jack and Coke.
And a, uh, Cosmo.

19:05.369 --> 19:06.412
Hey.

19:06.412 --> 19:06.912
Hey.

19:06.828 --> 19:09.165
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

19:09.165 --> 19:10.582
Another box?

19:10.582 --> 19:13.419
How much more stuff
do you have?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.878
No, look,

19:14.878 --> 19:17.298
this box is full
of our past, right?

19:17.298 --> 19:18.715
Mmm. Yeah.

19:18.715 --> 19:21.468
And this one's empty.

19:21.468 --> 19:22.636
But...

19:22.636 --> 19:26.640
The seashell we found
the first time
we went to the beach.

19:27.391 --> 19:31.270
The matches
from the restaurant
where you proposed.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.897
The bottle of wine
I drank tonight

19:33.897 --> 19:36.650
trying to figure
this whole thing out.

19:36.858 --> 19:39.445
Whoa, you drank
the whole bottle?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.197
It took a lot of figuring.

19:41.197 --> 19:45.617
My point is that one's
as full as it's ever
gonna get.

19:45.617 --> 19:49.037
But this one,
we'll be adding to
for the rest of our lives.

19:49.037 --> 19:51.081
And before we know it,
it'll be so full

19:51.081 --> 19:53.792
that that one,
will seem like nothing.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.796
You're the best.

20:00.216 --> 20:04.261
And one brand new spatula.

20:05.221 --> 20:10.434
What do you say we go make up
in our big queen sized bed?

20:10.434 --> 20:12.561
[GASPS]
The Sonia Bed.

20:12.561 --> 20:17.483
What do you say
we stop calling it
the Sonia Bed?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.401
Yeah, uh, gotcha.

20:24.531 --> 20:26.492
[SIGHS]

20:32.248 --> 20:35.166
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]

20:37.461 --> 20:40.922
Wow, is that really
how you dance?

20:42.299 --> 20:42.841
No.

20:42.841 --> 20:49.139
That's just a fake
old guy dance I do as a joke.

20:50.181 --> 20:51.224
Wait a second.

20:51.224 --> 20:53.310
You're not really 27,
are you?

20:53.310 --> 20:56.480
You know what,
you caught me.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.774
It's time to come clean.

20:58.774 --> 21:01.026
I really dance like this.
