WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.501
So, where were we?

00:05.601 --> 00:07.603
Previously on Rogue.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.139
Listen to me, Ethan, don't go
anywhere near her apartment.

00:10.239 --> 00:11.707
She's setting you up.

00:11.807 --> 00:16.178
One of you guys is gonna tell
me what the fuck is going on.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.317
I am Marty Stein.

00:21.417 --> 00:23.052
I'm a lawyer.

00:23.152 --> 00:24.420
I know who you are.

00:24.487 --> 00:26.222
Yay! Then we're halfway there.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.695
What do you want?

00:32.795 --> 00:37.667
For now, I want my fucking name back.

00:39.969 --> 00:41.637
You okay?

00:41.737 --> 00:44.173
- Goodbye, Marty.
- What?

00:44.273 --> 00:47.810
Betsy, I just, I said I
was sorry. You're right!

00:47.910 --> 00:50.780
Bitching and moaning isn't going
to do either one of us any good.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.249
<i>I have the flash drive.</i>

00:53.349 --> 00:56.619
We should talk.

00:56.719 --> 00:58.487
Oh, we're gonna talk, Marty.

00:59.355 --> 01:00.656
We're gonna talk.

01:04.794 --> 01:06.295
I have a pulse!

02:41.891 --> 02:43.692
Go get me a coffee, Marty.

03:21.097 --> 03:23.165
So, I guess we're even now, huh?

03:30.806 --> 03:32.975
Did you hire someone to try to kill me?

03:33.075 --> 03:35.244
- Straight to the point.
- That's right.

03:36.412 --> 03:37.813
No.

03:38.714 --> 03:39.915
Why would I do that?

03:42.318 --> 03:44.111
Tilda Switzer said that
you hired the Russians.

03:44.146 --> 03:47.936
- Tilda Switzer is a lying fucking bitch.
- Yeah? Set me straight then, Marty.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.525
Set me straight.

03:52.395 --> 03:53.963
What?

03:54.063 --> 03:57.500
I admit, I may, in a manner of
speaking, gotten the ball rolling.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.634
On Mia?

03:58.734 --> 04:00.937
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia

04:01.003 --> 04:03.439
was behind the short selling
of the mine, which means what,

04:03.539 --> 04:05.775
which means she had access
to the auditor's report.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.077
She read the auditor's report.

04:08.177 --> 04:10.613
The auditor who's plane
crashed mysteriously?

04:10.713 --> 04:13.416
Well, I prefer
"tragically", but whatever.

04:13.516 --> 04:16.319
Was Mia just a tragic loose end?

04:16.418 --> 04:20.389
Mia short selling the stock was
gonna scupper the entire deal.

04:20.488 --> 04:22.558
And let me tell you something,
it was a big fucking deal.

04:22.658 --> 04:24.560
The Russians wanted her out.

04:24.660 --> 04:27.029
The Russians put a hit out on her

04:27.096 --> 04:28.976
against my knowledge.
Why would I want her dead?

04:28.998 --> 04:30.466
I wanted to know what she knew.

04:30.566 --> 04:32.902
I wanted to know how
she got her information.

04:34.136 --> 04:36.038
So I hire Greg Barrett to find out.

04:36.138 --> 04:38.474
He came back with a very
interesting little story.

04:38.574 --> 04:40.977
About a magic flash drive,

04:41.077 --> 04:44.680
that had the ability to
get inside the NSA database.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.851
Which means what? Which means they
have access to every individual,

04:48.951 --> 04:51.354
every company, worldwide.

04:51.454 --> 04:54.457
- Sounds ridiculous.
- Ridiculous, right? That's what I thought.

04:54.557 --> 04:57.126
Until I had Mia taken for a
little test drive the other day

04:57.226 --> 05:00.096
before you heroically
came and rescued her.

05:00.196 --> 05:03.171
- So, you had Barrett hire me.
- I knew you'd find the girl.

05:04.734 --> 05:06.369
You put me in the line of fire, Marty.

05:08.070 --> 05:09.372
- What?
- Unintentionally.

05:09.472 --> 05:11.107
- Unintentionally?
- Yeah.

05:12.241 --> 05:13.743
Think about it, what was I doing,

05:13.843 --> 05:16.612
you were starting a new business, right?

05:16.712 --> 05:18.881
I was throwing you work,
I was throwing you a bone.

05:18.948 --> 05:21.250
I didn't know this was gonna turn
into a giant fucking clusterfuck.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.519
Why didn't you fucking call me?

05:23.619 --> 05:25.454
Why didn't you give me a heads up?

05:25.554 --> 05:28.157
I'll tell you why, cause
you're a fucking piece of shit.

05:28.924 --> 05:29.925
Yeah.

05:31.193 --> 05:32.528
Yeah.

05:32.628 --> 05:34.930
I appreciate there may be a
little bad blood between us.

05:35.031 --> 05:37.500
A little bit of bad
blood, just a little bit.

05:39.135 --> 05:40.803
Let me tell you something.

05:40.903 --> 05:44.774
You stick with this girl and
you're gonna wind up dead.

05:44.874 --> 05:46.208
You're gonna wind up dead.

05:46.308 --> 05:48.944
All of a sudden you're
concerned with my wellbeing, huh?

05:49.011 --> 05:50.212
You're un-fucking believable, Marty.

05:50.312 --> 05:51.714
- What do you know about her?
- You're a fucking worm.

05:51.814 --> 05:54.984
- What do you actually know about her?
- You know what?

05:55.051 --> 05:56.952
You wanna talk business.
Let's talk business.

05:57.053 --> 05:58.220
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.389
- Okay. Just business.
- Yeah.

06:00.489 --> 06:02.258
All right.

06:02.358 --> 06:04.093
You've got Mia, I've got the drive.

06:04.193 --> 06:06.162
Lets put the two together.

06:06.262 --> 06:08.164
- You get money.
- Yeah.

06:08.264 --> 06:10.299
- And I get what I want.
- Which is?

06:11.767 --> 06:13.402
My name.

06:17.273 --> 06:18.874
And the drive.

06:24.547 --> 06:26.715
We figure out how this thing works.

06:28.084 --> 06:30.352
- We set a new password.
- Okay.

06:30.453 --> 06:34.557
Now, we don't need her, we get rid
of her. And then, it's you and me,

06:34.657 --> 06:38.397
on top of the fucking
ziggurat, where we belong.

06:41.864 --> 06:44.567
I'm the devil you know, Ethan.

06:47.002 --> 06:48.537
- Like it or not.
- Yeah.

06:52.608 --> 06:54.844
This is not me.

06:54.944 --> 06:56.464
What the fuck? What are you doing here?

06:56.479 --> 06:57.713
Get... Jesus!

07:00.115 --> 07:02.218
- Marty.
- What?

07:02.318 --> 07:03.798
You have not been returning our calls.

07:03.819 --> 07:06.555
I've been a little bit busy,
Alexei, if you don't mind.

07:07.156 --> 07:09.024
Mr. Kelly.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.726
I'm sorry, do I know you?

07:10.826 --> 07:13.095
No, but I know you.

07:13.195 --> 07:15.631
I've been watching you on home videos.

07:15.731 --> 07:18.601
- Is that right?
- At the slaughterhouse.

07:18.701 --> 07:20.803
It is quite a daring rescue you made.

07:25.241 --> 07:27.992
You think I have never been
shot in the guts before?

07:28.944 --> 07:30.957
I'm not aiming at your guts.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.414
Neither am I.

07:35.084 --> 07:39.221
You made promise to us. Now
you are ducking our calls.

07:39.421 --> 07:40.656
This is very concerning.

07:40.756 --> 07:42.796
I'm not ducking anything.
No one's ducking anything.

07:42.825 --> 07:45.594
And I don't appreciate you just
dropping in on me like this.

07:45.694 --> 07:47.162
I'm a little busy, Alexei.

07:47.263 --> 07:49.765
I will talk to you when
I'm good and fucking ready.

07:50.566 --> 07:52.735
Or you can talk to us now.

07:54.203 --> 07:55.971
I'm calling Bershov.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.609
Jesus!

08:00.709 --> 08:03.212
Bershov wants to keep you alive for now.

08:03.312 --> 08:05.447
But there is a tax on this.

08:06.515 --> 08:08.917
Did he fail to mention that?

08:09.018 --> 08:10.719
Let us talk terms.

08:10.819 --> 08:12.888
Okay, let's talk terms.

08:12.955 --> 08:14.323
Go fuck yourself.

08:14.423 --> 08:16.492
The tax is half million a week.

08:18.627 --> 08:19.962
Um... A, no.

08:20.062 --> 08:23.599
And B, addendum, Get
the fuck out of my bar.

08:23.699 --> 08:25.701
Fuck off me, get the fuck off me.

08:27.703 --> 08:28.971
Uh-uh. Hey.

08:30.272 --> 08:32.474
Back up, now.

08:41.582 --> 08:44.229
You shoot him, I shoot you.

08:44.574 --> 08:46.755
- Is that what we want?
- No.

08:48.757 --> 08:51.894
You know your men have been
dropping like flies lately.

08:51.994 --> 08:54.181
Can you afford to lose another one?

09:00.369 --> 09:01.470
Okay.

09:02.705 --> 09:04.907
So what do we do here?

09:05.007 --> 09:06.275
How much does Marty owe you?

09:06.375 --> 09:09.378
- I don't owe him shit.
- Shut the fuck up.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.780
The price is the price.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.951
But I tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

09:16.018 --> 09:18.354
Same price to keep you both alive.

09:18.454 --> 09:19.788
Minus the phone.

09:19.888 --> 09:21.690
You have 48 hours.

09:21.790 --> 09:24.560
That's a lot of money in a
very short amount of time.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.462
You're clever boys.

09:27.162 --> 09:28.731
You will find a way.

09:53.555 --> 09:54.990
Okay, Marty.

09:57.159 --> 09:59.361
What's your deal with Bershov?

10:03.165 --> 10:07.069
Bershov was tying to tie up
the loose ends on the deal.

10:07.169 --> 10:10.239
And then, I find out
that Barrett was killed,

10:10.339 --> 10:11.907
and I figured, I'm not stupid, I'm next.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.411
So I go into hiding, I
figure out my next move

10:15.511 --> 10:19.348
and I go to Bershov, with a new offer.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.985
- The drive.
- The drive.

10:23.085 --> 10:24.186
Yeah.

10:26.388 --> 10:28.524
Okay.

10:28.624 --> 10:30.826
I'm gonna call you later
today with my decision.

10:33.061 --> 10:35.898
You're in this as much
as I am, you know that.

10:37.366 --> 10:39.234
Get yourself a new phone.

10:41.136 --> 10:43.005
Anna Drubeskaya.

10:44.106 --> 10:45.841
That's her name.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.317
For such a tiny person, you
step like a fucking elephant.

11:31.787 --> 11:32.921
It's good to see you.

11:34.556 --> 11:35.556
You, too.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.494
How you feeling?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.462
Like I slept in a ditch.

11:40.562 --> 11:43.365
It was more of a gully than a ditch.

11:43.465 --> 11:46.702
You look like you've been, uh,
sleeping in some gullies yourself.

11:49.805 --> 11:51.507
Lowry was here.

11:52.841 --> 11:55.110
He wasn't his usual warm self.

11:56.111 --> 11:57.145
Oh?

11:58.447 --> 11:59.915
You know anything about that?

12:02.417 --> 12:05.954
Some people have a weird
way of showing concern.

12:06.054 --> 12:07.256
Mmm-hmm.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.793
I told him.

12:11.894 --> 12:13.328
You told him what?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.097
What do you think?

12:15.197 --> 12:17.399
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

12:17.499 --> 12:20.168
- Why would you...
- You were missing.

12:20.235 --> 12:23.839
- I thought it had something to do with it.
- Who else knows?

12:23.939 --> 12:26.174
I don't know. You'd have to ask Lowry.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.509
You called my Lieutenant?

12:27.609 --> 12:29.311
No, I didn't call your lieutenant.

12:29.411 --> 12:30.946
What about the mayor? Does he know?

12:31.013 --> 12:32.915
Did you go to the home, did you
tell my mom? Did you tell her

12:33.015 --> 12:36.652
that your son who you don't
remember is now also a dirty cop?

12:39.388 --> 12:41.123
What did you say to Marty?

12:42.658 --> 12:44.459
I told him about Greg Barrett,

12:44.560 --> 12:47.963
and I told him about Ethan. I told
him what you told me to tell him.

12:48.931 --> 12:50.098
How'd he react?

12:50.198 --> 12:51.934
Like he always does, he
said thank you very much

12:52.034 --> 12:53.702
and he kicked my ass out of there.

12:55.804 --> 12:58.373
Why didn't you call me after you left?

12:58.473 --> 13:04.079
I was going to, but I wanted
a bite to eat, I got hungry.

13:06.081 --> 13:07.249
And then what?

13:07.316 --> 13:09.851
Then I get outside and this motherfucker

13:09.952 --> 13:13.188
hits me over the head, throws me in
a car and takes me out to the woods.

13:13.288 --> 13:15.457
- Why did he take you?
- I don't know.

13:18.093 --> 13:20.095
Do you think I'm lying?

13:20.195 --> 13:21.730
I don't think it was random.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.198
I don't think it's random either,

13:23.298 --> 13:25.701
but all the fucker said
was dig your own grave.

13:27.569 --> 13:29.471
Did you see anything or hear anything?

13:29.571 --> 13:31.640
Yeah, a lot of Russian.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.043
There was one with a cell,
he said a name... Tilda...

13:35.143 --> 13:38.880
Sweetzer, Swetzer...

13:38.947 --> 13:42.351
Switzer, Switzer. Tilda Switzer,
that's it. Tilda Switzer.

13:44.119 --> 13:46.221
So the dead Russian we found

13:46.254 --> 13:48.857
strangled and bludgeoned
in the shallow grave.

13:50.459 --> 13:51.960
You do that?

13:54.162 --> 13:55.664
It was pretty impressive, huh?

13:56.965 --> 13:58.634
I suppose.

13:58.734 --> 14:01.169
You've had some practice,
digging your own grave.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.039
Get myself out, too, apparently.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.108
Apparently.

14:09.177 --> 14:11.146
Why don't you help get
me the fuck out of here?

14:30.632 --> 14:31.667
Yeah?

14:35.404 --> 14:37.239
Something you forgot to yell at me for?

14:40.475 --> 14:42.110
Sure, come on in.

14:45.714 --> 14:47.883
This place is a piece of shit.

14:47.983 --> 14:50.185
Well, I've been in
places like this before,

14:50.285 --> 14:53.622
and I've worked my way right out of it.

14:53.722 --> 14:57.092
Besides, the last spot I was in
really didn't work out, you know.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.361
Doesn't mean you gotta
punish yourself like this.

14:59.461 --> 15:01.430
Well, some people do what they gotta do.

15:02.864 --> 15:04.465
What're you doing here, Z?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.706
- You okay?
- I don't know.

15:20.382 --> 15:23.385
Look, I can't help if I
don't know what's going on.

15:26.855 --> 15:28.056
I'm pregnant.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.758
Oh.

15:29.858 --> 15:30.858
Yeah.

15:32.461 --> 15:33.895
And it's, uh...

15:35.630 --> 15:37.733
Don't you dare even
ask me if it's yours.

15:37.833 --> 15:41.403
Hey, listen, I'm sorry, but I thought
we were doing... I thought you was on...

15:41.503 --> 15:42.604
I was.

15:43.138 --> 15:44.473
Huh?

15:44.573 --> 15:48.310
That's all you gotta say? "Huh?"

15:48.410 --> 15:50.479
I come over here and tell you
that I'm pregnant with your child

15:50.579 --> 15:52.280
and the best thing you
can muster up is "huh"?

15:52.380 --> 15:53.782
Z, look, I'm...

15:53.882 --> 15:55.183
Just gimme a second, I'm processing.

15:55.217 --> 15:56.518
I knew this was a mistake.

15:56.618 --> 15:58.286
Z, come on, hold on.

15:58.386 --> 16:01.256
All right, just give me
a second, this is a sign.

16:01.356 --> 16:02.791
- A sign?
- Yes.

16:02.891 --> 16:05.761
You and me and Eli,
we should be a family.

16:06.995 --> 16:08.630
How are you supposed
to take care of a family

16:08.730 --> 16:10.532
when you can't even
take care of yourself?

16:10.632 --> 16:12.934
I'm standing right here, that
gotta count for something.

16:13.034 --> 16:16.538
- Counts for very little.
- But not for nothing. Right?

16:21.676 --> 16:24.579
I got my asset forfeiture hearing today.

16:26.081 --> 16:29.117
I'll get my store back, and
I'm gonna get this shit right.

16:29.217 --> 16:30.519
I've heard that one before.

16:31.353 --> 16:33.388
Listen,

16:33.488 --> 16:35.123
I'm gonna take you
out to dinner tonight.

16:36.024 --> 16:37.993
Somewhere nice.

16:38.059 --> 16:40.495
You know, we can talk about
this a little bit more.

16:44.900 --> 16:48.170
The sitter's got school in the morning,
so it's gotta be an early night.

16:48.236 --> 16:50.038
I'll pick you up at seven.

16:51.439 --> 16:53.408
And you better take me somewhere nice.

17:11.526 --> 17:13.028
What's up?

17:13.127 --> 17:15.564
I need you to look into
something for me, Jen.

17:15.664 --> 17:17.132
Sure. You got a social?

17:17.232 --> 17:18.767
No, just a name.

17:18.867 --> 17:19.968
Hit me.

17:22.804 --> 17:23.805
There.

17:26.273 --> 17:28.476
Her name is Anna Drubeskaya.

17:28.577 --> 17:30.712
You looking for anything specific?

17:30.812 --> 17:33.148
No. I looked for it online,
I couldn't find anything.

17:33.248 --> 17:35.083
Yeah, okay. I'll take a look.

17:39.688 --> 17:41.256
Hey, are you okay?

17:41.356 --> 17:44.092
That's a relative term these days, Jen.

17:45.427 --> 17:47.195
Yeah. You got that right.

17:48.396 --> 17:50.198
Thanks. Thanks for doing this.

17:52.467 --> 17:53.535
No worries.

17:53.635 --> 17:54.636
Okay.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.340
Tilda Switzer?

18:37.379 --> 18:38.880
Federal agent.

19:20.588 --> 19:21.589
Fuck.

19:38.773 --> 19:40.542
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.712
Well, how'd it go?

19:43.812 --> 19:46.381
He wants to work with us.
You, me and the flash drive.

19:49.017 --> 19:50.885
What did you say?

19:50.986 --> 19:53.388
- I told him I'd think about it.
- You trust him?

19:58.093 --> 19:59.194
What's wrong?

20:01.596 --> 20:03.398
The Russians found us, Mia.

20:03.498 --> 20:04.498
Shit.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.601
What did they want?

20:09.504 --> 20:10.939
I mean, specifically.

20:11.039 --> 20:14.209
Half a million dollars. Is
that specific enough for you?

20:17.312 --> 20:18.413
What?

20:20.281 --> 20:24.619
Marty cut a deal to save his
own ass. Now they wanna collect.

20:25.487 --> 20:26.955
We have 48 hours.

20:27.055 --> 20:28.590
"We"?

20:28.690 --> 20:31.159
As far as they're concerned,
they think I'm with Marty.

20:34.462 --> 20:36.431
We should just go.

20:36.531 --> 20:38.266
You know, we should get on
the next flight and just leave.

20:38.299 --> 20:40.702
- Go? Go where?
- I don't know. Anywhere.

20:40.802 --> 20:42.170
And leave the drive?

20:42.270 --> 20:45.673
Yeah, fuck the drive.
Okay? I don't need it.

20:45.774 --> 20:48.276
We don't need it. We could just go
somewhere together and start over.

20:48.376 --> 20:50.845
I'm not starting over, Mia.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.580
And I'm not running.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.150
I tried that once
before. It doesn't work.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.053
Okay, then what? Hmm?

20:58.153 --> 21:00.313
Even if we could get our
hands on half a million dollars

21:00.321 --> 21:02.121
do you think that they're
gonna leave us alone?

21:02.190 --> 21:03.758
You think the Russian's
are just gonna let us go?

21:03.858 --> 21:05.298
If you want to go, I won't stop you.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.040
Oh, what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

21:07.128 --> 21:08.430
That means I can't force you

21:08.530 --> 21:09.664
to do something that you don't wanna do,

21:09.697 --> 21:11.099
that's what it means.

21:17.439 --> 21:18.440
Yeah.

21:19.674 --> 21:20.675
You're right.

21:23.645 --> 21:26.245
And we're in this together, so if
that means we stay, then we stay.

21:26.714 --> 21:27.816
Hmm.

21:31.419 --> 21:34.322
How are we gonna get our
hands on that much money?

21:47.035 --> 21:48.169
Marty.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.738
Uh...

21:50.839 --> 21:53.741
I didn't know we had
something on the books today.

21:53.842 --> 21:55.977
Come to think of it, I don't
even know where the books are.

21:56.077 --> 21:57.745
No, no worries.

21:57.846 --> 22:01.049
I just came by to say hi,
see how you were doing.

22:01.883 --> 22:03.818
Well, I'm glad you did.

22:03.918 --> 22:06.421
I still feel terrible about
that whole mix up with the...

22:06.521 --> 22:08.089
Uh, with the...

22:08.189 --> 22:10.058
- Well...
- What? Oh!

22:10.158 --> 22:12.727
Oh, you mean the abandoning
me in my hour of need,

22:12.794 --> 22:14.729
when I'm the one most responsible

22:14.829 --> 22:16.698
for getting you elected to
the United States senate,

22:16.798 --> 22:19.067
you mean that little mix up, Bob?

22:19.167 --> 22:21.236
Marty, I wanted to help
you out, you know that,

22:21.302 --> 22:25.673
but the team, they felt
us being seen together,

22:25.773 --> 22:27.675
you know, given your little, well...

22:28.710 --> 22:31.279
- Problem.
- Bob, listen to me.

22:31.379 --> 22:32.480
Water under the bridge.

22:33.448 --> 22:34.649
It's good to hear.

22:34.749 --> 22:36.784
Besides, I knew you didn't
need my help to rebound.

22:36.885 --> 22:38.686
I saw Furnell's retraction.

22:38.786 --> 22:40.788
I never doubted your innocence,
Marty, not for a second.

22:40.889 --> 22:43.224
Well, Bob, you know what?
I really do appreciate that.

22:43.291 --> 22:44.531
That's very nice of you to say.

22:45.416 --> 22:50.431
This is a list of undeclared donations
right into your war chest, Bob.

22:50.532 --> 22:52.400
Violations of almost every campaign

22:52.500 --> 22:53.935
finance law, on the books.

22:54.002 --> 22:56.571
I mean, as far as I know, I'm no expert.

23:00.175 --> 23:01.342
Where'd you get these?

23:02.710 --> 23:03.945
That's a good question, Bob.

23:04.012 --> 23:06.314
You buried those pretty
deep, I gotta say.

23:06.414 --> 23:07.749
It wasn't easy.

23:17.792 --> 23:18.860
Please.

23:20.595 --> 23:21.596
Please.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.978
You know, I've been doing a
lot of thinking lately, Bob.

23:37.078 --> 23:40.181
- Of course.
- I mean, what with my situation

23:40.248 --> 23:43.451
and the trauma and all,
I got to wondering...

23:43.551 --> 23:47.589
What am I going to leave behind,
you know, what is my legacy gonna be.

23:48.489 --> 23:49.691
You've been thinking that?

23:49.791 --> 23:52.627
I mean, maybe I've been taking too much.

23:52.727 --> 23:56.397
Taking from the city, from
the state, from the country.

23:56.497 --> 23:59.634
Maybe that's why friends
were so quick to abandon me

23:59.734 --> 24:02.737
at the very first sign of smoke.

24:02.837 --> 24:04.172
Now, Marty, I just said...

24:04.272 --> 24:06.274
Hey, hey,
hey. Nah-uh-uh.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.576
That's on me. On me.

24:08.676 --> 24:11.012
That's my responsibility. No one else.

24:11.079 --> 24:13.181
We teach others how to treat us.

24:13.281 --> 24:14.616
Boy, is that ever the truth.

24:17.018 --> 24:19.120
And that's why I was thinking,

24:19.220 --> 24:22.357
I want to start giving back. You know?

24:24.826 --> 24:25.827
Uh...

24:27.528 --> 24:28.529
Well...

24:29.464 --> 24:32.166
What do you have in mind?

24:32.267 --> 24:37.038
Well, I was thinking, you
know, with your help, of course,

24:37.138 --> 24:41.409
that I would be appointed to the
District Court of the state of Illinois.

24:46.581 --> 24:47.882
Uh...

24:47.982 --> 24:50.351
You want to be a Federal judge?

24:51.586 --> 24:53.577
- Bingo, Bob.
- Marty, I can appreciate that

24:53.612 --> 24:57.225
this last week has gone a long
way to repairing your reputation,

24:57.292 --> 25:01.195
but even if I could make a case
for you, and that is a big if.

25:01.329 --> 25:02.630
Even then,

25:02.730 --> 25:05.733
District Court Judge is
a lifetime appointment

25:05.833 --> 25:08.703
and there's just no
spots available right now.

25:08.803 --> 25:11.005
Why don't you let me deal with that?

25:16.044 --> 25:17.912
Nice to see you, Senator.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.908
I should keep running.

25:47.809 --> 25:49.711
You probably should.

25:49.811 --> 25:53.247
But if I do, something tells me
you'll just pop around the next corner.

25:53.348 --> 25:55.917
And the next one, and
the next one after that.

25:56.017 --> 25:57.819
You know, I was thinking Gibsons.

25:57.919 --> 25:59.654
You know, low key.

25:59.754 --> 26:01.923
What do you think? Like,
maybe, 20, 30 people?

26:02.023 --> 26:03.758
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:03.858 --> 26:06.194
I'm talking about your retirement party.

26:07.895 --> 26:10.176
That's funny. I have few more
rounds left in me yet, Marty.

26:13.534 --> 26:15.136
What?

26:15.236 --> 26:17.438
I swear to God, I've found this old lamp

26:17.538 --> 26:19.273
and whenever I rub it,

26:19.374 --> 26:22.143
a genie pops out and grants me.

26:22.243 --> 26:25.847
any wish I want.

26:25.947 --> 26:28.015
This is tax fraud, Your Honor.

26:28.116 --> 26:30.017
Right there, in black and white.

26:43.698 --> 26:45.099
You son of a bitch.

26:45.166 --> 26:46.768
I'll foot the bill for your party.

26:46.868 --> 26:49.003
A simple "Thank you" will be sufficient.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.638
Go fuck yourself.

26:52.707 --> 26:55.009
That's it, run it off,
girl. Sweat it out!

26:58.780 --> 27:01.015
Mr. Dinard, do you have
anyone who'd like to make

27:01.115 --> 27:03.484
a statement on your behalf?

27:03.584 --> 27:06.154
Uh, no, I believe that you have
the paperwork in front of you...

27:06.254 --> 27:08.456
Special Agent Lowry and Agent Deakins.

27:08.556 --> 27:09.924
Yes, I have the letters.

27:10.024 --> 27:12.293
I'm asking you whether you
have anyone who is willing

27:12.393 --> 27:14.262
to speak for you in court today.

27:14.362 --> 27:18.199
No, I didn't realize that I
needed to have representation.

27:19.167 --> 27:20.167
So, that's a no?

27:21.202 --> 27:22.437
Yes, Your Honor.

27:22.537 --> 27:24.972
My understanding was that
this was just a formality.

27:25.072 --> 27:26.941
And who told you that, sir?

27:27.041 --> 27:29.477
Special Agent Lowry and Agent Deakins.

27:29.577 --> 27:31.879
Well, if that is what
they told you, Mr. Dinard,

27:31.979 --> 27:33.614
I'm afraid that they're ill-informed.

27:38.986 --> 27:40.388
Am I keeping you, Mr. Dinard?

27:42.824 --> 27:45.827
- No, sir.
- Glad to hear it.

27:45.893 --> 27:47.762
The court rules in favor of the State.

27:47.862 --> 27:49.564
Your Honor, please.

27:49.664 --> 27:51.466
- Sir, listen, I had a deal.
- We're done.

27:51.566 --> 27:53.868
- Your deal is not my concern.
- Why not?

27:53.901 --> 27:57.305
This court has full discretion
and has no obligation

27:57.405 --> 28:00.241
to honor any previous arrangements
that you might've made.

28:00.341 --> 28:02.043
That is fucking bullshit.

28:02.109 --> 28:03.211
Mr. Dinard,

28:04.145 --> 28:05.746
your assets were seized

28:05.780 --> 28:07.782
to prevent the ongoing continuation

28:07.882 --> 28:09.350
of a criminal enterprise.

28:09.450 --> 28:12.920
You are a drug dealer, you're
a murderer, you're a gangster,

28:12.987 --> 28:15.723
and as far as I am
concerned, you're a terrorist.

28:15.823 --> 28:18.263
You're the embodiment of everything
that is wrong in this city.

28:18.326 --> 28:20.561
Now this threatening attitude

28:20.661 --> 28:22.563
might work well for
you out on the street,

28:22.630 --> 28:26.133
but you will not hold this court
hostage with your thug-like attitude

28:26.234 --> 28:28.536
and your tactics. We're done here.

28:48.322 --> 28:49.957
Patty.

28:50.057 --> 28:51.826
Buddy, you do not have to do this.

28:51.926 --> 28:53.794
Hey, it was me they tried to kill.

28:54.996 --> 28:55.997
Ow!

28:56.831 --> 28:58.132
Not an invalid.

28:59.634 --> 29:00.634
Okay.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.819
Is he really necessary?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.588
Insurance against you ripping me off,

29:20.688 --> 29:22.757
- among other things.
- Oh, yeah?

29:22.857 --> 29:24.325
You guys have met before. Right?

29:24.425 --> 29:26.260
Oh, we have had the pleasure, yes.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.760
Do you have the drive, Marty?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.769
So, what am I looking for?

29:34.869 --> 29:38.205
Well, no team sports, obviously,
there's too many X-factors.

29:38.306 --> 29:39.840
So what does that leave? Golf? Tennis?

29:39.907 --> 29:42.109
- Ping pong?
- What about MMA?

29:42.209 --> 29:43.769
How about something with a little grace,

29:43.778 --> 29:45.580
a little brawn, little brains?

29:45.613 --> 29:49.283
We're not buying tickets,
Marty, we're placing a bet.

29:49.383 --> 29:51.352
I'm putting up the cash, my call.

29:51.452 --> 29:53.254
I thought the government
took all your cash.

29:53.354 --> 29:57.933
Government couldn't find all my
cash if I drew them a treasure map.

29:58.326 --> 29:59.894
Okay, what are you suggesting?

29:59.961 --> 30:02.530
How about the fine art of boxing?

30:04.498 --> 30:05.866
Fine. Sure. Start with that.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.572
Okay, I'm gonna need some guidance here.

30:11.672 --> 30:14.075
Pull up a list of all the
domestic fights for this evening,

30:14.175 --> 30:15.710
anything that's officially sanctioned.

30:15.810 --> 30:19.046
Then we need to find
doctors, trainers, promoters,

30:19.146 --> 30:20.748
anybody with an inside scoop.

30:26.587 --> 30:30.424
Our teams are going through
Tilda Switzer's house as we speak.

30:30.491 --> 30:32.059
Heading to your office next.

30:32.159 --> 30:33.794
- Waste of time.
- Why's that?

30:33.894 --> 30:35.196
There's nothing to find.

30:35.296 --> 30:37.131
Your boss was gruesomely murdered.

30:37.231 --> 30:38.666
You think that was a mistake?

30:38.766 --> 30:42.357
I don't know what this is,
maybe a jealous ex-boyfriend.

30:42.392 --> 30:43.504
No.

30:43.604 --> 30:45.940
I think she was involved
with the wrong people.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.075
Wrong people, what wrong people?

30:48.175 --> 30:50.044
She was a boring businesswoman.

30:50.144 --> 30:52.480
In charge of one of
the largest operating

30:52.580 --> 30:54.649
uranium mine's in North America.

30:56.117 --> 30:58.185
Teetonka Chicago Inc.,

30:58.285 --> 31:00.888
six months ago, was
hovering at 53 cents.

31:00.988 --> 31:04.425
As of market close, it's at 266 a share.

31:04.525 --> 31:06.694
Too bad they don't pay
me in stock options.

31:06.761 --> 31:08.796
Can you explain how that
surge is even possible?

31:08.896 --> 31:10.364
Look, I am not a financial analyst.

31:10.464 --> 31:12.307
I only answer the phones.

31:18.205 --> 31:21.575
If you know something,
we can protect you.

31:22.410 --> 31:24.145
Unlikely.

31:24.245 --> 31:25.925
You don't even know
who to protect me from.

31:31.952 --> 31:33.921
What we know is that the Russian mob

31:34.021 --> 31:37.324
is responsible for Tilda's death.

31:37.992 --> 31:40.461
We just don't know why.

31:40.561 --> 31:43.531
Do you need to see
what they did to Tilda?

31:43.597 --> 31:47.668
What do you think they're gonna
do to you once they know we spoke?

31:47.735 --> 31:50.604
You think they're gonna trust
you to keep your mouth shut?

31:51.505 --> 31:52.505
I have nothing to say.

31:53.340 --> 31:55.176
Okay.

31:55.276 --> 31:58.579
Then can you confirm
the Teetonka Chicago Inc.

31:58.679 --> 32:01.459
Was in the process of
being sold? Is that right?

32:01.494 --> 32:02.450
No.

32:03.017 --> 32:04.819
No?

32:04.919 --> 32:06.959
Then how do you explain
the articles in the Tribune

32:06.987 --> 32:09.056
discussing the sale
to Blasko Industries?

32:09.156 --> 32:12.326
I didn't say it wasn't happening,
I said I couldn't confirm it.

32:12.426 --> 32:14.995
- Why? - It's called a
"non-disclosure agreement".

32:15.096 --> 32:18.165
I'm not asking you to
discuss anything confidential.

32:18.265 --> 32:21.302
You're asking me to discuss
information that you already have,

32:21.402 --> 32:23.904
which is a waste of our time.

32:23.971 --> 32:25.873
If you want anything
else, get a warrant.

32:25.973 --> 32:27.742
Or speak with our lawyer, Marty Stein.

32:31.212 --> 32:33.214
Your lawyer Marty Stein?

32:34.281 --> 32:35.316
Wow.

32:48.596 --> 32:49.764
Henry.

32:50.431 --> 32:51.999
Marty!

32:52.099 --> 32:54.635
I haven't seen you since
that Arizona/Oregon disaster.

32:54.702 --> 32:56.937
Yeah, that did not go so
well. How you holding up?

32:57.738 --> 32:59.373
Well, Mitzi passed.

32:59.473 --> 33:01.542
- Sorry to hear that.
- Why?

33:01.642 --> 33:03.583
- Who are they?
- Friends.

33:04.095 --> 33:06.380
Yeah? Then why are they eye
balling me like fucking cops?

33:06.480 --> 33:08.182
Jesus Christ, Henry.

33:08.282 --> 33:12.286
You're one paranoid
son-of-a-bitch, you know that?

33:12.386 --> 33:14.455
What are we doing here today?

33:14.555 --> 33:17.424
We would very much like
to place a bet, Henry.

33:17.525 --> 33:19.493
- Your phone broken?
- Actually, yeah.

33:19.593 --> 33:22.029
But we thought we better make
this one in person, anyway.

33:22.129 --> 33:23.531
Why?

33:23.631 --> 33:25.391
We're talking about a
larger bet than normal.

33:25.466 --> 33:27.902
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about a quarter mil.

33:30.304 --> 33:32.072
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

33:32.173 --> 33:34.708
- Marty, I can't cover that.
- Sell some of it off.

33:34.809 --> 33:36.644
- Even if I did...
- Even if you did what?

33:36.744 --> 33:39.246
You gonna let a bet this
size walk out the door?

33:39.346 --> 33:40.514
Really, Henry?

33:42.850 --> 33:44.451
That's a lot of money for
a football game, Marty.

33:44.485 --> 33:46.086
Who said anything about football?

33:46.187 --> 33:48.189
- Oh, what're we talking about?
- Talking about boxing.

33:48.289 --> 33:49.490
- Boxing?
- Yeah.

33:50.324 --> 33:51.625
Archuleta/Garcia.

33:51.692 --> 33:53.727
- No way, can't do it.
- Why not?

33:53.828 --> 33:56.730
Archuleta's a six to one
favorite, Marty. I can't do it.

33:56.831 --> 33:59.166
- Who said anything about Archuleta?
- What?

33:59.266 --> 34:03.404
Who said anything about
Archuleta? We're talking Garcia.

34:03.504 --> 34:05.506
And I just told you, Archuleta's
a six to one favorite.

34:05.573 --> 34:07.493
I mean, you do understand
what that means, right?

34:07.541 --> 34:08.708
Yeah.

34:08.809 --> 34:10.844
It means that if Garcia wins,

34:10.945 --> 34:14.475
we stand to make a shit ton of
money, that's what that means.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.719
You come in here after two years,

34:18.819 --> 34:20.920
without an invite, with
people I don't know,

34:21.021 --> 34:25.192
and you wanna put a quarter million
dollar bet on a six to one underdog?

34:25.292 --> 34:27.261
Someone's trying to rip me off.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.362
No one's trying to rip you off, Henry.

34:29.463 --> 34:31.098
No one's trying to fuck with you.

34:32.065 --> 34:34.034
We are placing a bet.

34:34.134 --> 34:35.536
That's called gambling.

34:37.972 --> 34:39.172
What the hell is this?

34:39.273 --> 34:43.077
$250,000 American cash, greenback.

34:46.981 --> 34:48.581
What're you doing bringing it here?

34:48.681 --> 34:50.516
Show of good faith.

34:50.618 --> 34:53.152
You get to hold on to
that money until the fight.

34:57.591 --> 34:59.860
All right. I'll take your money.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.662
I'm gonna need to count it first.

35:01.762 --> 35:02.930
Knock yourself out.

35:08.769 --> 35:10.304
Should you be working, son?

35:10.404 --> 35:11.472
Never felt better.

35:19.246 --> 35:22.616
Gonna be honest with you,
not a lot to go on here.

35:22.716 --> 35:26.186
I appreciate that, which is
why we're not looking for much.

35:26.287 --> 35:29.056
A wiretap on Marty Stein
isn't exactly nothing.

35:29.123 --> 35:30.591
He's an officer of the court.

35:30.691 --> 35:31.926
Technically, I suppose.

35:37.197 --> 35:38.966
Judge Warner already issued a warrant

35:39.033 --> 35:41.535
for Switzer's home and office.

35:43.070 --> 35:45.673
You're asking me to
take a big step here.

35:46.707 --> 35:49.743
Based on what? A hunch?

35:49.843 --> 35:52.413
The original warrant further indicated

35:52.513 --> 35:54.615
Marty Stein's involvement
in the kidnapping

35:54.715 --> 35:57.551
and attempted murder
of Detective Finnegan.

35:57.651 --> 35:59.853
Your case is circumstantial, at best.

36:01.388 --> 36:02.489
Right now, it is.

36:02.589 --> 36:03.724
Which is why we're here.

36:06.193 --> 36:08.595
Even if I give you what you want,

36:09.763 --> 36:13.269
there's a decent chance another
judge overturns this on appeal.

36:14.301 --> 36:16.501
Cross that bridge when we come to it?

36:26.313 --> 36:28.582
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

36:40.861 --> 36:42.496
Agent Lowry.

36:42.596 --> 36:43.831
Come by to say thanks?

36:43.897 --> 36:45.733
No. Not exactly.

36:45.833 --> 36:49.203
- I don't understand.
- Didn't seem like the judge did either.

36:50.704 --> 36:53.207
It went against you?

36:53.307 --> 36:54.708
I'm sorry, Marlon.

36:54.808 --> 36:57.611
I know you stuck your neck out for us.

36:57.711 --> 37:00.114
Don't even worry about it. I'm
not really here for an apology.

37:01.315 --> 37:02.483
Then what are you here for?

37:04.184 --> 37:06.020
Working with you guys...

37:06.120 --> 37:07.454
You know, helping you all out,

37:07.554 --> 37:10.924
it was the first time in my life
I was part of something good.

37:11.759 --> 37:12.993
Somethin' right.

37:14.528 --> 37:17.765
I'm wondering if there's
anything you all can use me for.

37:17.865 --> 37:19.143
You mean like a CI?

37:19.178 --> 37:20.834
Nah, I'm not a snitch.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.336
Then what?

37:22.403 --> 37:25.506
Did you graduate from
Quantico and not tell anybody?

37:25.606 --> 37:28.842
I'm talking about, you know, outreach.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.444
Working with the community.

37:30.544 --> 37:32.880
Trying to keep these kids
away from this type of life.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.048
Agent Lowry.

37:34.681 --> 37:36.183
- Yeah.
- Who is this?

37:37.251 --> 37:39.053
Well, this is Marlon Dinard.

37:39.153 --> 37:40.454
He's been helping with the...

37:40.554 --> 37:42.322
Unless the rest of that
sentence is he's helping you

37:42.423 --> 37:44.723
finish collect statements
from your agents,

37:44.892 --> 37:46.226
I don't give a fuck.

37:46.326 --> 37:48.395
I've got three dead agents
and not enough answers.

37:48.495 --> 37:50.064
I needed those statements yesterday.

37:50.164 --> 37:52.933
Well, I understand, but I was
just telling Mr. Dinard that...

37:53.033 --> 37:55.102
To get the fuck out of my task force.

37:57.938 --> 37:59.606
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

38:05.312 --> 38:07.748
Listen, Marlon, why don't you
see me in a couple of months?

38:07.848 --> 38:10.715
- I'll see what we can work out.
- Listen, I don't have a couple of months.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.986
Okay? This shit has to happen.

38:13.087 --> 38:15.556
Well, I don't have
time right now, Marlon.

38:17.758 --> 38:18.826
I'm sorry.

38:22.029 --> 38:23.130
Good luck to you.

38:44.585 --> 38:46.620
Hey.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.188
What can I getcha?

38:48.255 --> 38:49.756
Three bourbons, please. Thank you.

38:49.823 --> 38:50.858
I'll have a water.

38:50.958 --> 38:52.126
Have a drink, will you?

38:52.226 --> 38:53.506
I'll take the water like I said.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.761
Coming up.

38:58.799 --> 39:00.167
He doesn't look like he's very injured.

39:00.234 --> 39:02.469
Well, thank God, because the
commission wouldn't let him fight.

39:02.569 --> 39:04.271
I don't believe his manager's
lettin' him in there.

39:04.371 --> 39:05.839
He's going to get killed.

39:05.939 --> 39:09.309
For $80 million, I'd fight
with a torn rotator cuff.

39:09.409 --> 39:10.944
Fine by me. Let him die.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.579
Come on now.

39:12.679 --> 39:14.014
Ding ding.

39:16.617 --> 39:17.918
Come on now.

39:18.018 --> 39:19.753
Step back. Step back.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.056
Easy. What the... Easy.

39:23.157 --> 39:24.391
Why is he fuckin'...

39:24.491 --> 39:26.609
He's going toe-to-toe
with him. Back up!

39:26.627 --> 39:28.095
Shit.

39:28.128 --> 39:31.765
Jesus Christ. Oh! Shit.

39:31.865 --> 39:34.301
There it is, goddammit!

39:34.401 --> 39:36.403
You know what? I think
I'm gonna have that drink.

39:36.503 --> 39:37.783
- You guys want anything?
- No.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.184
Be right back.

39:44.144 --> 39:45.546
- Hey.
- Do you have anything?

39:45.646 --> 39:47.181
I'm working on it.

39:47.281 --> 39:50.317
Whoever she is, Anna Drubaskaya
is a hard girl to find.

39:50.417 --> 39:52.319
- Keep me posted all right?
- Deal.

39:52.419 --> 39:54.575
Miss, can I get a Maker's?

40:02.796 --> 40:04.631
So, I thought we said
about seven, right?

40:10.370 --> 40:12.439
Why don't you come in for a sec?

40:12.539 --> 40:14.107
- All right.
- You want something to drink?

40:14.942 --> 40:15.976
Yeah. Sure.

40:23.283 --> 40:24.384
Where's Eli?

40:25.552 --> 40:26.887
Sent him to my mom's.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.889
Oh. That's a good idea.

40:50.944 --> 40:52.779
Marlon, you know I
care about you, right?

40:54.248 --> 40:56.250
Of course, I know that.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.585
We've been through some stuff together.

40:58.685 --> 41:02.522
That's damn straight.

41:02.623 --> 41:04.825
But we've always managed to
stay in each other's lives.

41:07.961 --> 41:08.996
Yeah.

41:09.796 --> 41:10.931
That's all I want.

41:11.632 --> 41:12.633
Please,

41:14.901 --> 41:16.169
just let me get through this.

41:21.642 --> 41:22.943
You're great with Eli,

41:24.778 --> 41:27.981
and he absolutely
adores having you around.

41:28.115 --> 41:30.751
That's good, because
I'm not going nowhere.

41:32.552 --> 41:33.587
Marlon...

41:35.555 --> 41:37.357
Hey, baby, listen. Today at court

41:38.592 --> 41:40.427
that was just a little
setback, you know.

41:40.527 --> 41:41.662
I'm not finished.

41:42.896 --> 41:44.998
The way that judge talked to you...

41:46.733 --> 41:48.468
Look. I know,

41:49.403 --> 41:51.505
it was wrong, he was wrong.

41:52.306 --> 41:53.774
It was what he said.

41:57.210 --> 42:00.347
And I've been turning a
blind eye for too long,

42:03.016 --> 42:04.217
to who you are...

42:06.253 --> 42:07.988
To what you are.

42:10.624 --> 42:13.827
Hey, I can change.

42:13.927 --> 42:15.362
All right? I can make this right.

42:15.462 --> 42:17.030
For you and for Eli.

42:18.131 --> 42:19.266
And for our baby.

42:21.902 --> 42:23.704
I can't have that around my kid.

42:31.812 --> 42:33.313
I made an appointment today.

42:37.317 --> 42:39.086
I'm going to get it taken care of.

42:41.355 --> 42:43.323
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

42:46.293 --> 42:47.694
You see, I thought you said...

42:47.794 --> 42:49.696
I know what I said.

42:54.301 --> 42:56.703
It wasn't an easy decision, Marlon.

42:56.803 --> 42:59.506
This is not your decision
to make by yourself!

43:00.540 --> 43:01.675
Yes, it is, Marlon.

43:04.511 --> 43:05.712
It's done.

43:08.915 --> 43:10.016
My mind's made up.

43:50.323 --> 43:52.726
This is bad, Marty, this kid's
getting his fuckin' ass kicked.

43:52.793 --> 43:54.060
He's toying with him.

43:54.161 --> 43:55.429
Garcia, come on. Tell me
you're toying with him.

43:55.529 --> 43:57.030
There, there. Stick it, will you?

43:58.532 --> 44:00.167
- Here you go.
- Go, go at him!

44:01.568 --> 44:03.069
Come on, kick his ass.

44:03.136 --> 44:04.971
Take it to the final. Go, baby, go.

44:10.577 --> 44:12.279
His fucking shoulder's gone.

44:12.379 --> 44:13.847
There it is! He's
gotten off the left hand.

44:13.947 --> 44:16.183
He's got nothin' left.
Come on, now. Finish him!

44:16.283 --> 44:18.251
- Finish him.
- It's a dent.

44:21.788 --> 44:24.024
Yeah! Yeah, we did it! We've done it!

44:24.124 --> 44:26.026
We've done it! We did it!

44:33.533 --> 44:35.101
- Hey.
- Shit.

44:46.780 --> 44:49.950
I'm assuming that you
don't have my money.

44:50.050 --> 44:51.351
You fucking ripped me off.

44:51.418 --> 44:52.978
I ripped you off? How did I rip you off?

44:52.986 --> 44:54.855
Six to one on that fight.
It was fucking fixed.

44:54.955 --> 44:56.595
You listen to me. I
want my fucking money.

44:56.656 --> 44:57.858
- And I want it right now.
- I don't got it.

44:57.958 --> 44:58.992
What can I tell you?

45:00.290 --> 45:02.346
- You know what?
- Ethan, don't.

45:02.381 --> 45:04.096
- Listen, motherfucker.
- Ethan, there's another way.

45:04.131 --> 45:06.800
You took a quarter million
fucking dollars from me.

45:06.900 --> 45:08.935
- I don't have it. What can I tell you?
- Really?

45:09.035 --> 45:12.205
I'll tell you something, you got one vote
for you, and you have one against you.

45:12.305 --> 45:14.865
Marty, he's your friend,
what it's gonna be?

45:15.041 --> 45:16.476
- Not my friend.
- Oh, yeah?

45:17.511 --> 45:19.646
- Wait! Wait!
- Wait, what?

45:19.713 --> 45:21.833
- What do you mean wait?
- I'll get you your fucking money.

45:21.915 --> 45:24.784
Oh, really? Because two seconds ago,
you didn't have my fucking money.

45:24.851 --> 45:26.653
Two seconds ago, I didn't have
a fucking gun stuck in my ear.

45:26.753 --> 45:28.188
Come here. Let's go.

45:37.531 --> 45:39.332
Mia. Stay in the car.

45:39.432 --> 45:41.134
What? Why?

45:41.201 --> 45:42.936
Because I don't know what's
going on up there, that's why.

45:43.036 --> 45:44.871
Okay, well, I can take
care of myself, Ethan.

45:44.938 --> 45:46.406
All right. Just stay in the car.

45:46.506 --> 45:48.742
Let's go. Get out.

45:48.842 --> 45:50.877
I'm gonna stay too, I'm
gonna talk to the girl.

45:52.279 --> 45:53.847
Get out of the car, Marty.

45:53.947 --> 45:54.981
Okay.

46:13.733 --> 46:14.834
Who the fuck is he?

46:16.670 --> 46:18.505
- What is this?
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

46:18.605 --> 46:21.808
This is the guy who's been
fucking backing your bets?

46:21.908 --> 46:25.478
Alexei! You are one dumb
fuck, you know that, Henry?

46:25.512 --> 46:26.880
You already have my money?

46:26.913 --> 46:28.348
No, but actually, you got ours,

46:28.448 --> 46:30.617
you fat Russian fuck. You piece of shit.

46:32.018 --> 46:33.820
What the fuck is going on?

46:33.920 --> 46:38.458
Your boy didn't cover his bet.
That's what's fucking going on.

46:38.558 --> 46:40.864
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true!

46:42.262 --> 46:43.430
And what was the bet?

46:43.463 --> 46:45.899
It was a quarter of a million
dollars. Garcia over Archuleta.

46:45.999 --> 46:47.601
This is how you planned to pay me?

46:47.667 --> 46:50.403
- With this insane wager?
- It wasn't insane, you...

46:50.503 --> 46:54.274
A six to one underdog,
not exactly a sure thing.

46:54.374 --> 46:56.476
I knew he had a torn rotator
cuff, you fuckin' dumb...

46:56.576 --> 46:59.112
- You fucking set me up!
- Shut up!

46:59.212 --> 47:01.348
We did our homework, we made a bet.

47:01.414 --> 47:04.718
Nevada Boxing Commission
reported no injury.

47:04.818 --> 47:05.919
They don't know yet.

47:07.053 --> 47:08.088
And how did you?

47:09.689 --> 47:11.491
How do you think?

47:11.558 --> 47:13.560
- The drive.
- That's right.

47:13.660 --> 47:16.363
I caught an email between
the trainer and the doctor.

47:16.463 --> 47:20.066
And because of this you
think I owe you money?

47:20.166 --> 47:21.334
- Depends.
- On?

47:21.434 --> 47:24.204
Yeah? Whether you're a
welching coward or not.

47:24.304 --> 47:25.905
That fucking bet was no good.

47:28.008 --> 47:30.110
And still you took it?

47:30.210 --> 47:33.113
- He fucking ripped me off, Alexei.
- Quiet!

47:36.816 --> 47:38.332
I'm not going to pay your money.

47:38.367 --> 47:40.787
- What's that?
- Really?

47:40.887 --> 47:45.392
But for this week, your debt
is paid. For this week only.

47:45.492 --> 47:48.561
And how much longer do you
expect us to keep paying, Alexei?

47:48.662 --> 47:50.163
I'm just curious.

47:50.263 --> 47:52.632
However long Mr. Bershov says so.

47:55.068 --> 47:56.569
Now get the fuck out of here.

48:00.573 --> 48:01.808
Come on.

48:29.703 --> 48:31.104
Hey.

48:31.204 --> 48:33.406
I need to see you. It's pretty urgent.

48:33.506 --> 48:35.008
- Hey, you know...
- Ethan, seriously...

48:35.108 --> 48:36.776
Let me call you back in a few minutes.

48:36.876 --> 48:39.112
- Yeah. Bye. -
Fine. Bye-bye.

48:40.647 --> 48:42.282
Who was that?

48:42.382 --> 48:45.062
It was Jen. I forgot I was supposed
to have a drink with her tonight.

48:45.151 --> 48:46.720
A drink?

48:46.820 --> 48:49.055
Yeah. She hasn't been
doing so well with,

48:49.122 --> 48:52.459
you know, losing her uncle and
she needs somebody to talk to.

48:52.559 --> 48:54.761
So I'll just drop you
back at your place.

48:54.894 --> 48:56.496
You know, why don't I just come along?

48:57.530 --> 48:58.898
I don't think that's a good idea.

49:05.505 --> 49:06.606
Oh, okay.

49:08.241 --> 49:09.809
Whatever you think is best.

49:33.566 --> 49:34.868
Jen, it's me.

49:55.421 --> 49:58.792
- Hey, Judge.
- Now don't do anything foolish, son.

50:00.260 --> 50:01.628
Give me your wallet.

50:05.265 --> 50:06.633
Wallet.

50:06.699 --> 50:08.134
And that cellphone, too.

50:11.371 --> 50:12.372
Cellphone.

50:13.907 --> 50:15.341
What do you want?

50:15.441 --> 50:18.745
I don't want to be here with
you, Judge. That's for sure.

50:18.845 --> 50:22.649
Where I want to be is
with my girl, celebrating.

50:22.749 --> 50:25.752
That's how my day was meant to go.

50:25.852 --> 50:27.420
But instead, I'm here with you.

50:30.490 --> 50:32.625
Man, I haven't even eaten yet.

50:32.725 --> 50:33.993
I'm hungry, what about you?

50:34.093 --> 50:36.563
Now look, what I said
in that courtroom...

51:04.858 --> 51:05.859
I forgot.

51:06.726 --> 51:07.760
What?

51:08.928 --> 51:10.663
How much I missed this place.

51:15.468 --> 51:16.569
Did you miss me?

51:17.871 --> 51:19.672
- Hmm?
- No.

51:19.772 --> 51:22.342
Come on, you missed me.

51:26.212 --> 51:28.248
You still got any of that, uh,

51:28.348 --> 51:31.985
stuff, in that desk?

51:32.085 --> 51:33.786
I'll get the mugs.

51:36.522 --> 51:37.857
You think Marty went to bed?

51:37.891 --> 51:40.393
I mean, it's been over
an hour and not one call.

51:48.668 --> 51:50.503
- Hello?
- It's Mia.

51:50.603 --> 51:53.072
Mia? This is unexpected.

51:53.172 --> 51:54.874
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

51:54.974 --> 51:56.609
Come over with Ethan in the morning.

51:57.977 --> 51:59.097
We need to talk alone.

52:02.181 --> 52:03.283
Are you there?

52:05.084 --> 52:07.253
Oh, I'm listening.

52:07.353 --> 52:09.589
Route 401 Diner on Sixth.

52:09.689 --> 52:11.157
Meet me there in half an hour.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.094
Was that Mia Rochlan?

52:16.729 --> 52:18.631
- Sounds like it.
- I thought she was dead.

52:18.731 --> 52:19.731
Let's go.

52:21.467 --> 52:22.468
There goes that drink.

52:24.704 --> 52:25.705
Come on, let's go.

52:28.908 --> 52:31.756
- You all right?
- Yes, stop asking that.

52:46.359 --> 52:49.329
Ma'am, Harper Deakins, DEA.

52:49.429 --> 52:50.897
With the Chicago Gang Task Force.

52:50.964 --> 52:53.399
This is Detective Patrick Finnegan.

52:53.499 --> 52:55.234
We're hoping you can
help us with something.

52:58.304 --> 52:59.872
- Hey.
- You get something?

53:00.540 --> 53:02.275
Yeah.

53:02.375 --> 53:04.210
Well, don't keep me in
suspense, let's go. What is it?

53:04.310 --> 53:06.679
Well, it's... You should
know it's not great.

53:06.779 --> 53:07.981
Okay, let me see it.

53:11.751 --> 53:14.020
Seems your girlfriend has a nasty habit

53:14.120 --> 53:15.688
of turning up around dead bodies.

53:17.156 --> 53:19.125
- She knew him.
- Who?

53:19.225 --> 53:20.626
Vasily.

53:20.727 --> 53:22.061
Yeah.

53:23.363 --> 53:24.731
She shot him.

53:24.831 --> 53:27.600
Mia... You know, whatever
her name is, she knew him.

53:32.238 --> 53:34.640
It says here Anna Drubeskaya
was killed two years ago

53:34.741 --> 53:36.376
in a subway explosion in Moscow.

53:37.677 --> 53:38.711
You sure can pick 'em.

53:38.811 --> 53:40.580
What's that supposed to mean?

53:40.680 --> 53:42.080
I did all right with you, didn't I?

53:42.749 --> 53:44.083
Thank you.

53:44.183 --> 53:46.786
Can't exactly use you as
a reference though, can I?

53:48.254 --> 53:49.255
No.

54:02.702 --> 54:03.702
There's one.

54:18.885 --> 54:21.054
- Evening, sir.
- Hello.

54:21.087 --> 54:22.889
What can I get you?

54:22.989 --> 54:24.069
Coffee.

54:24.090 --> 54:25.591
Okay, coming up.

54:42.108 --> 54:43.376
There's two.

54:59.959 --> 55:02.228
So, what is good here?

55:02.328 --> 55:04.630
I don't know. You called
the meeting, you tell me.

55:09.569 --> 55:11.104
Anna Drubeskaya.

55:12.271 --> 55:13.673
The walking dead.

55:16.209 --> 55:17.577
Even the dead have to eat.

55:22.014 --> 55:23.116
We don't need him.

55:26.185 --> 55:27.353
Excuse me?

55:28.287 --> 55:29.856
You have the drive.

55:29.956 --> 55:31.090
You have me.

55:31.190 --> 55:33.294
It's a match made in heaven.

55:34.327 --> 55:37.224
All we need to do is
get rid of Ethan Kelly.
