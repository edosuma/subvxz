WEBVTT

00:09.067 --> 00:10.933
How's everything on
the home front?

00:10.933 --> 00:12.800
- I mean, it's been tough.
- You have to worry

00:12.800 --> 00:15.933
about Rob, and how you could be
strong and better for you,

00:15.933 --> 00:18.233
and now your baby.
Don't you want to get your

00:18.233 --> 00:20.200
- together?
- I do.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.133
We're gonna go out
of town for a month.

00:22.133 --> 00:24.133
- Is Scott going?
- No.

00:24.133 --> 00:25.967
This is gonna be,
like, the longest I'm away from

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
- the kids and Kourt ever.
- How do you feel?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.333
Well, I'm kind of
anxious.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.567
Any time I have too much time on
my hands, I'm not exactly sure

00:31.567 --> 00:41.633
what to do.â™ª â™ª

00:41.633 --> 00:43.467
Gabbana, go in and
get it.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.867
I accidentally threw the ball in
the Jacuzzi, and she just, like,

00:45.867 --> 00:47.633
- can't figure it out.
- Is she in there just

00:47.633 --> 00:49.200
- chilling?
- It's right there,

00:49.200 --> 00:50.867
isn't it?
Just get on the step.

00:50.867 --> 00:53.033
Look.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.933
- I know, I'm trying to show you.
- I don't get it.

00:55.933 --> 00:59.067
You'll jump in a pool, you won't
jump in a three-foot hot tub?

00:59.067 --> 01:02.100
There's a  staircase
here!

01:02.100 --> 01:03.900
She went on the step,
you guys.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.700
Uh-oh, gettin' it.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.133
- Good girl, finally!
- There you go.

01:10.133 --> 01:14.867
- Yeah! Good girl!
- This dog's a champion.

01:32.767 --> 01:35.900
Oh, Northie,
come here right now!

01:35.900 --> 01:39.433
- Oh...
- Northie!

01:39.433 --> 01:43.967
Aah! Hello!
Why are you so cute?

01:43.967 --> 01:45.933
- What am I gonna do?
- Say hi

01:45.933 --> 01:47.900
- to Uncle Robbie.
- Did you say hi to

01:47.900 --> 01:50.800
Uncle Robbie?
Hey.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.467
See what happens
when you go in hiding for three

01:52.467 --> 01:54.600
years?
So how the hell are you,

01:54.600 --> 01:56.467
- Haberstran?
- I'm good.

01:56.467 --> 01:59.300
Are you and, like,
Chyna better, though?

01:59.300 --> 02:01.300
Yeah, we're, like,
completely all good.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.367
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, everything's good.

02:03.367 --> 02:05.967
You know what I was
thinking, guys?

02:05.967 --> 02:08.767
MJ's birthday is coming up,
and I thought we could all go

02:08.767 --> 02:11.533
down there and have dinner with
her for her birthday.

02:11.533 --> 02:15.267
And we could take her to the
races the next day at Del Mar

02:15.267 --> 02:17.233
- racetrack.
- She likes that?

02:17.233 --> 02:19.067
Her favorite thing to
do is go to the races.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.733
- Can I bring the kids?
- Yeah.

02:20.733 --> 02:22.533
- I'm in.
- She would love that.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.533
And Kourtney's going to be back
from her trip, so she'll bring

02:24.533 --> 02:26.533
her kids, too.
But we could go down and take

02:26.533 --> 02:29.067
her to dinner.
And we'll invite Chyna so she

02:29.067 --> 02:30.700
can get to know her a little
better, too.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.400
Yeah, that would be so
much fun.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.033
I really think it's
important that we go and

02:36.033 --> 02:39.633
celebrate my mom's birthday with
her and bring the whole family.

02:39.633 --> 02:43.967
Rob hasn't seen her in a long
time, so with Rob coming--

02:43.967 --> 02:46.933
and if Chyna comes with him--
I think she would really, really

02:46.933 --> 02:49.200
- be excited.
- Why do you have a bowl

02:49.200 --> 02:51.167
- of marbles?
- The bowl of marbles

02:51.167 --> 02:53.767
represents how many weekends I
have left in my life.

02:53.767 --> 02:56.033
- What?
- How do you know,

02:56.033 --> 02:57.700
- though?
- Assuming I would live

02:57.700 --> 02:59.667
- till 80 or 85.
- What happens when you

02:59.667 --> 03:02.100
- have four marbles left?
- I know.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.133
I didn't think about it like
that.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.933
- Like, that's horrible.
- Is that why they say

03:05.933 --> 03:08.600
- you're losing your marbles?
- I'm losing my marbles.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.067
That's where the term comes
from.

03:16.967 --> 03:19.200
- Turn left.
- Oh, shut up!

03:19.200 --> 03:21.767
- Hi.
- Fresh shave? Laser?

03:21.767 --> 03:23.733
I get laser hair
removal. Look...

03:23.733 --> 03:25.600
- You look real shiny.
- You can't see my hair?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.633
I have hair-- little stubs?
Look, you can.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.600
- No. Nothing.
- They're little, but

03:29.600 --> 03:32.300
look how thin they are. See?
How is real estate?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.033
Like, flipping?
Is that, like, preoccupying your

03:34.033 --> 03:35.867
- time and stuff?
- No, I mean, listen,

03:35.867 --> 03:37.500
all the real estate stuff is
great.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.200
It's just at the end of the
night, when I lay my head down

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
on the pillow and I'm alone, and
it's, like, I know my kids are

03:41.200 --> 03:45.467
across the country, I just feel,
like, super alone sometimes.

03:45.467 --> 03:49.400
It's just tough, 'cause, like,
I see pictures she posted, and,

03:49.400 --> 03:52.700
like, she'd send me videos of
the kids, and I'm just, like...

03:52.700 --> 03:54.800
- That's good, though.
- It's amazing.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.233
I don't want it any other way.
But then it just makes me miss

03:57.233 --> 04:00.033
- them more and more.
- I get it's hard for

04:00.033 --> 04:03.167
Scott to be away from Kourt and
the kids, but Kourtney and Scott

04:03.167 --> 04:06.567
are co-parenting, and this has
to be their new normal--

04:06.567 --> 04:09.100
them having separate family
vacations.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.533
But that doesn't mean that he
should let this dictate his

04:11.533 --> 04:13.500
happiness.
He can't just be miserable

04:13.500 --> 04:15.767
'cause his kids are with their
mom.

04:15.767 --> 04:19.000
It's just sad.
Like, it's just weird when, you

04:19.000 --> 04:21.133
know, memories are happening and
I'm not there.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.167
And that's usually when I get,
like, upset.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.733
I think we all have
our, like, individual style that

04:35.733 --> 04:39.000
we just wear every single day.
Kim's into kimonas...

04:39.000 --> 04:41.533
What's a "kimona"?
kimon-o.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.400
- Kimono, kimono.
- Do you want me to tell

04:43.400 --> 04:46.167
you what your style is-- you
wear black?

04:46.167 --> 04:47.967
No, no, can I tell you
what her style is?

04:47.967 --> 04:51.133
- Your style, yeah.
- Whatever I wear.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.067
You guys, I'm worried
about Scott.

04:53.067 --> 04:56.433
I feel like he's in, like, kind
of like a low point in his life

04:56.433 --> 04:59.133
with Kourtney and the
family gone.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.400
And you just, like, get in a rut
and you stay in it.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.000
Don't you know about that
lifestyle?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.700
- I do.
- Right.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.467
I like it when he was
always really dressed up.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.400
It reminded me of, like, the
Frank Sinatra days.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.500
Well, I mean, I miss
the Lord version of Scott.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.567
He needs to shave and
wear a pocket scarf.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.167
No, the beard has
changed his life, so he could be

05:17.167 --> 05:20.733
the Lord in other ways.
The last that I remember that

05:20.733 --> 05:25.400
Scott was, like, fun and silly
was when he embodied the Lord.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.133
With this crown, I
crown you Scott Disick, the new

05:28.133 --> 05:30.233
Lord of the Manor.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.533
- Long live His Lordship.
- What's up, London?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.467
- Lord Disick is here!
- He was always dressed

05:34.467 --> 05:37.333
to the nines and was always,
like, really elaborate,

05:37.333 --> 05:39.167
- over the top.
- Going up.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.733
That looks great,
Scott.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.733
Hello, ladies and

05:42.733 --> 05:46.100
gentlemen.
Tonight we dine like gentlemen!

05:46.100 --> 05:49.267
But I feel like lately
Scott's been, like, forgetting

05:49.267 --> 05:52.100
to have fun and takes life too
seriously.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.000
So I do wish that we got some
more of the Lord version of

05:55.000 --> 05:57.133
Scott.
And maybe help him find some

05:57.133 --> 06:00.300
happiness just for him.
When you talk to me, what do

06:00.300 --> 06:02.700
you-- what's your focal point?
Like, what do you stare at?

06:02.700 --> 06:04.533
I don't know.
Nothing bad.

06:04.533 --> 06:06.500
- Oh, are you sure?
- Yeah.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.400
'Cause you look at my
teeth a lot.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.167
And I'm wondering is something
in them?

06:10.167 --> 06:12.133
It's hard for me to talk
to somebody...

06:12.133 --> 06:14.000
What... You just
looked at my teeth again.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.433
- What's in them?
- Nothing, they're good.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.400
- Edamames.
- Thank you.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.200
So what's going on
with Miss North?

06:31.200 --> 06:33.800
- Thank you.
- She had her second

06:33.800 --> 06:36.000
violin lesson today.
She loves it.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.967
- That's so cute.
- She's, like, so

06:37.967 --> 06:39.733
obsessed.
The teacher was like, "She's

06:39.733 --> 06:42.167
gonna learn to read music before
she can read the alphabet."

06:42.167 --> 06:44.833
That's so cool.
Sophia's like, "North is so

06:44.833 --> 06:46.733
lucky.
Her dad is gonna teach her how

06:46.733 --> 06:49.800
to sing, like how Daddy teaches
the boys how to play

06:49.800 --> 06:51.467
basketball."
So cute.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.200
Do you have to do the boys'
hair?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.800
No, the boys do their
own hair.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.300
You just have to keep their hair
short.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.733
Then you don't have to
worry about it.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.267
Yeah.
But Sophia's hair is, like,

06:59.267 --> 07:01.667
work.
Like, Sophia just started not

07:01.667 --> 07:03.733
crying when I wash her hair,
'cause it would get so, like,

07:03.733 --> 07:05.833
knotty.
And, like, brushing through the

07:05.833 --> 07:08.233
back part of her hair was
always, like, work.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.833
I've got to figure out
how to do North's hair.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.733
I can do her hair in a ponytail
or a bun.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.833
That's cute.
I love her hair in a bun.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.700
But she'll be like,
"I want a braid like Elsa!"

07:17.700 --> 07:19.267
I like how they love
Elsa.

07:19.267 --> 07:21.233
Totally, but I'm not
that good at braiding her hair,

07:21.233 --> 07:25.100
and I really want to learn how.
North is so proud of her curly

07:25.100 --> 07:28.467
hair, but she's very opinionated
on how she wants to wear her

07:28.467 --> 07:30.700
hair.
And as a mom, you don't want to

07:30.700 --> 07:33.533
have to tell her, "I don't know
how to do your hair."

07:33.533 --> 07:36.500
It's, like, such a prideful
thing to be able to make her

07:36.500 --> 07:39.000
look pretty and make her feel
confident.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
It's important to me.
North said to me, "Mama, you

07:42.000 --> 07:44.200
want curly hair?"
And I said yeah, and she goes,

07:44.200 --> 07:47.333
"Okay, how you get curly hair,
you get a spray bottle, and you

07:47.333 --> 07:50.267
go ch-ch-ch, and you
scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.

07:50.267 --> 07:51.867
And that's how you get good
curls."

07:51.867 --> 07:53.600
And I'm like, "Okay."
She already knows how

07:53.600 --> 07:55.333
- to do her own hair.
- Okay.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.033
That's so freakin'
cute.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.000
Oh, my God, there's a
mouse filter!

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
When I'm a mouse.
The dog filter doesn't work.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.767
What's this new
Snapchat on Instagram?

08:13.767 --> 08:15.700
I don't know.
I don't like change.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.467
I just got used to this
Snapchat.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.300
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mom.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.600
- Hey, L.D.
- What in God's name are

08:21.600 --> 08:23.867
- you doing?
- This is for you.

08:23.867 --> 08:27.200
- We're bringing back the Lord.
- What the...

08:27.200 --> 08:30.633
Yeah.
This is epic. Ep-ic!

08:30.633 --> 08:33.633
We miss the Lord, okay?
So bring it back.

08:33.633 --> 08:36.433
My mom and I decided
that we want to try to prevent

08:36.433 --> 08:39.233
any more of our family members
from being, like, stuck in a

08:39.233 --> 08:43.067
dark, sad place.
So why not show Scott his old

08:43.067 --> 08:47.667
Lord swag and see if he misses
it the way we miss the Lord.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.100
- You know what this is.
- Is that from the

08:50.100 --> 08:51.900
- Hamptons?
- Yes, it is.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.133
You guys don't call me a hoarder
for nothing.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.367
- Look how gorgeous you are.
- I've always wanted to

08:56.367 --> 08:58.100
- wrap myself in velvet.
- That was on the

08:58.100 --> 08:59.700
- flagpole?
- Yes.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.800
I never knew you guys
wanted the Lord back so bad.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.067
I actually thought the Lord was
a bit on the obnoxious side.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.967
Oh!
Oh.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.400
- Oh, my God.
- Okeydokey.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.000
I'm not mad.
But the Lord does...

09:11.000 --> 09:14.200
- bring out another side of me.
- Oh, my God.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.433
This is exactly what
I'm talking... about.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.167
I'm not gonna lie.
Seeing all my old, uh, Lord

09:20.167 --> 09:23.967
paraphernalia feels pretty good.
I mean, I just felt like when I

09:23.967 --> 09:25.933
was a lord, I was flying all
over the world, getting in

09:25.933 --> 09:27.767
trouble.
But if everybody wants it, I'm

09:27.767 --> 09:29.433
more than happy to bring it
back.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.533
- Look what I found.
- Wow.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.033
This is almost like...

09:34.033 --> 09:35.567
- Look.
- ...bone with a horse

09:35.567 --> 09:37.600
- handle.
- Look.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.767
Yeah.
Let me see if I still got it.

09:39.767 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.033
Ah, ho, ho, ho!
I appreciate you guys wanting

09:47.033 --> 09:50.233
the Lord back.
Getting me excited, really is.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.967
Chyna.
Hey, Khloe wants to ask you

09:59.967 --> 10:01.233
- something.
- I have a real

10:01.233 --> 10:03.833
question.
So, I want to know how to, like,

10:03.833 --> 10:06.900
isolate my upper thighs and make
them, like, wiggle.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.700
- Okay.
- How do I do that?

10:08.700 --> 10:10.400
You just, like, kind
of, like, wiggle your legs.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.800
- Am I doing it?
- Like your thigh

10:11.800 --> 10:13.100
- muscles.
- Am I doing it?

10:13.100 --> 10:14.767
- She's wearing jeans.
- You can't have on

10:14.767 --> 10:16.067
- jeans, though.
- Oh, okay.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.767
And then, once that
wiggles, then your ass wiggles.

10:18.767 --> 10:22.833
Yes!
Okay, you got to...

10:22.833 --> 10:25.200
you got to really t-teach me
in-depth.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.867
No, I'll show you,
it's super easy.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.833
Oh, good! Good! Okay.
Thank you.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.133
- Bye.
- Y'all are so fun.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.800
All right.
I'll call you later.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.000
It is really nice that
my sisters and I are forming a

10:39.000 --> 10:43.367
better relationship with Chyna.
And it's just good to have no

10:43.367 --> 10:46.633
bad energy or tension within the
family, that everyone is just

10:46.633 --> 10:49.300
smooth and cordial, and this is
what family is.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.467
- Well, hello there.
- Should we go in your

10:52.467 --> 10:53.600
- room?
- Hi,

10:53.600 --> 10:55.700
- Roberto.
- Hey, my little friend.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.333
- Wait, your bed looks smaller.
- Well, that's 'cause

10:58.333 --> 11:00.500
- it's covered in pillows.
- Leave my pillows

11:00.500 --> 11:03.767
alone.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.900
So, what are you two
doing?

11:05.900 --> 11:09.700
Um... MJ's birthday is
on Tuesday.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.633
And we're all going to this
horse race because

11:12.633 --> 11:15.267
Mom met my dad at
the Del Mar racetrack, and,

11:15.267 --> 11:17.900
like, she's told
us this story every day.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.467
- That's...
- I don't know if I could

11:19.467 --> 11:21.100
- do that.
- What?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.600
I can't go to the horse
races and stuff.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.600
I just don't feel comfortable
wearing the same shirt, and

11:26.600 --> 11:28.500
- shorts, and sandals, and a hat.
- If you wear sweats,

11:28.500 --> 11:30.400
I'll wear sweats.
What do I care?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.367
I'm just not
comfortable.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.367
- 'Cause what?
- 'Cause of my weight, I'm

11:34.367 --> 11:36.367
- just not comfortable, like...
- So you're not coming

11:36.367 --> 11:41.200
- to San Diego?
- I... I mean, I might.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.333
- Might not.
- Obviously, I know

11:44.333 --> 11:47.533
clothes is a big deal and you
want to feel comfortable, but I

11:47.533 --> 11:50.133
also want Rob to come and kind
of push himself to make these

11:50.133 --> 11:53.133
memories.
My grandmother is, you know,

11:53.133 --> 11:55.933
turning 82, and God forbid
anything were to happen, I think

11:55.933 --> 11:58.567
he would be really upset with
himself about that.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.567
Rob, you said you were gonna
come.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.967
- I know.
- It's your

12:02.967 --> 12:05.900
grandmother's 82nd birthday.
How could you not go?

12:05.900 --> 12:10.567
I don't know.

12:10.567 --> 12:13.467
- â™ª â™ª- I got rid of the

12:13.467 --> 12:15.900
Bugatti.
I should buy a fighter jet, no?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.867
You know, if I'm gonna get my
Lord back on, I think I

12:17.867 --> 12:20.233
definitely need to bring Lord
Airways into the mix.

12:20.233 --> 12:22.733
- I need a plane already.
- Only 40 million bucks.

12:22.733 --> 12:25.000
- No big deal.
- If you didn't want to

12:25.000 --> 12:27.333
come to San Diego, 'cause you
were, like, insecure and

12:27.333 --> 12:30.000
couldn't find anything to wear,
we can, like, find a stylist to

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
- get you, like, stuff.
- Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.233
You have to, like, start
getting up and getting dressed

12:34.233 --> 12:36.667
and, like, getting motivated.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.733
Being in London brings
back so many memories of being

12:49.733 --> 12:53.233
royal, and I just feel like I
need a plane already.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.567
This is the only thing I've
never gotten.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.567
Being back in London definitely
reminds me of my roots.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.467
And when I say "roots," I mean
my lordship, where I became the

13:01.467 --> 13:04.500
- Lord.
- You should get that

13:04.500 --> 13:06.233
- one.
- Wow, look at that

13:06.233 --> 13:08.133
thing.
I think Khloe and Kris are

13:08.133 --> 13:10.067
right.
I need to let the Lord back out.

13:10.067 --> 13:13.000
And going shopping at the
biggest air show in the world is

13:13.000 --> 13:16.267
not a bad place to start.
I got rid of the Bugatti.

13:16.267 --> 13:19.300
- I should buy a fighter jet, no?
- Imagine trolling

13:19.300 --> 13:21.567
- around Calabasas in this?
- This has got to be

13:21.567 --> 13:23.667
- quicker than a Bugatti.
- Oh, for sure.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.767
You know, if I'm gonna
get my Lord back on, I think I

13:25.767 --> 13:27.967
definitely need to bring Lord
Airways into the mix.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.933
Does this come in a
two seater?

13:29.933 --> 13:31.967
- It might get lonely in there.
- Get a picture of me.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.033
This is not bad.
I don't think there's anything

13:35.033 --> 13:37.767
more royal you could do than
probably owning your own private

13:37.767 --> 13:41.433
- aircraft.
- Only 40 million bucks.

13:41.433 --> 13:45.167
That's not that bad.
Â£40 million for a one seater?

13:45.167 --> 13:47.300
Two seater's probably 60
million-- no big deal.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.000
It's cab fare.
I've narrowed it down to at

13:50.000 --> 13:52.767
least I know which brand I want.
And it's definitely Gulfstream.

13:52.767 --> 13:55.233
- Definitely Gulfstream.
- A lord wouldn't fly in

13:55.233 --> 13:58.233
anything less than a Gulfstream.
And it's true.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.900
It makes sense.
Lordstream.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.233
Lordstream.
What are you gonna put on the

14:03.233 --> 14:06.733
- side of the plane?
- Lord.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.333
Are we gonna go
swimming today?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.733
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:18.733 --> 14:20.733
- One...
- Hi.

14:20.733 --> 14:24.567
...two, three!
Yay! Kick, kick, kick...

14:24.567 --> 14:26.700
What are you doing,
Northie?

14:26.700 --> 14:30.900
Ready, set, dive.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.933
How cute is her dive?

14:34.933 --> 14:38.933
So, Rob says he's not
coming to San Diego?

14:38.933 --> 14:41.933
No, well, he said, you
know, he's just insecure,

14:41.933 --> 14:45.167
he has no new clothes, and he
just doesn't feel, like,

14:45.167 --> 14:47.867
- appropriate going like that.
- That's weird.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.867
Who knows, he might
come.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.567
- But you know.
- Yeah.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.000
Call him
and talk him into it.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.767
- Where are you going, Ryan?
- All right, I'll call

14:55.767 --> 14:58.433
him.
I understand that Rob is

14:58.433 --> 15:01.700
not comfortable in his own skin
and he doesn't have anything to

15:01.700 --> 15:04.600
wear, but, like, it's not a
reason to miss my grandma's

15:04.600 --> 15:06.700
birthday.
We can pull clothes for him.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.567
We can have stuff made.
Like, as long as he's open to

15:09.567 --> 15:12.433
the idea, we can definitely find
him something to wear.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.500
- Yo.
- Hey, what are you doing?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
We're driving to take
some pictures.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.633
- We're going to Reseda...
- Oh, that's cute.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.267
What I wanted to see if you
didn't want to come to San Diego

15:22.267 --> 15:24.600
'cause you were, like, insecure
and couldn't find anything to

15:24.600 --> 15:27.600
wear, we can, like, find a
stylist to get you, like, stuff.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.200
I mean, I'm just sick
and tired of wearing, like,

15:31.200 --> 15:34.000
Gucci sandals and a black
T-shirt and a Dodger hat.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.133
You know what I mean?
Especially to the horse race

15:36.133 --> 15:38.700
- stuff.
- Yeah, but we never know

15:38.700 --> 15:41.267
how many birthdays she's gonna
have left, and I just don't want

15:41.267 --> 15:44.133
you to use, like, "Oh, I have
nothing to wear" as an excuse

15:44.133 --> 15:46.333
- for, like, another year.
- Yeah.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.633
I think you have to,
like, just for even your own

15:48.633 --> 15:51.933
soul, like, you have to just
start getting up and getting

15:51.933 --> 15:54.367
dressed and, like, getting
motivated.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.700
I know. I mean, if we
can find something, yeah,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.167
obviously I'm happy to try
stuff.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.167
All right, let me see
what I can do and, like, what I

16:01.167 --> 16:03.167
could find, and we'll go from
there.

16:03.167 --> 16:06.367
- All right.
- Okay, I'm gonna take a

16:06.367 --> 16:08.267
five-minute nap.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.833
- Hi.
- Welcome to Kimble

16:23.833 --> 16:25.167
- Studio. How you doing?
- Hi. How are you?

16:25.167 --> 16:26.800
- Good. How are you?
- Ooh, look at those

16:26.800 --> 16:28.300
- braids.
- It's like teal at

16:28.300 --> 16:29.800
- the bottom.
- Hi!

16:29.800 --> 16:31.467
- How are you?
- Good.

16:31.467 --> 16:34.133
Kim Kimble is a
celebrity hair stylist who

16:34.133 --> 16:37.567
teaches how to do different hair
techniques.

16:37.567 --> 16:41.133
So it's, like, so exciting that
we're gonna meet with her and

16:41.133 --> 16:44.200
she's gonna teach us how to
braid and how to just take care

16:44.200 --> 16:46.467
of curly hair.
I'm, like, struggling.

16:46.467 --> 16:49.467
North's hair is, like, ringlets,
like, curly, curly, curly, so I

16:49.467 --> 16:52.833
definitely want her to, like,
feel proud of her hair and wear

16:52.833 --> 16:55.533
it... Like, anytime she sees
someone with curly hair, she,

16:55.533 --> 16:57.733
like, runs up to them and was
like, "You have curly hair like

16:57.733 --> 16:59.233
me!"
Aw.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.067
And I just want to,
like, figure out how to do her

17:01.067 --> 17:03.267
hair.
I mean, Khadijah and I talk

17:03.267 --> 17:05.100
- about it all the time.
- I literally can't

17:05.100 --> 17:07.600
do my child's hair.
It's kinda bad, it's kinda bad.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.400
I can absolutely help
you.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.033
I can show you how to work with
curly hair...

17:11.033 --> 17:12.700
- Okay.
- ...and if you want me

17:12.700 --> 17:14.300
to, I can give you some little
braid techniques.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.333
You can do some just little
cute... that's really cute now.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.933
So, with the braid, you take
three separate pieces...

17:18.933 --> 17:20.933
Uh-huh.
- ...and you just take

17:20.933 --> 17:24.800
your finger underneath the top
piece... and then you go under.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.433
You got to braid it so it's on
to the hair.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.600
I know. I just don't
know how to do that.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.667
See, I'm working all
three, and as I'm going, I'm

17:32.667 --> 17:35.467
grabbing pieces of hair and
connecting it with that piece

17:35.467 --> 17:36.967
- here.
- Yeah.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.233
So, I would start
with this one going under.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.233
- Under.
- And then now this

17:41.233 --> 17:43.300
goes in this hand and that goes
in that hand.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.200
Now that part going under.
Under the middle.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.200
Okay, okay.
And that goes under, and then,

17:48.200 --> 17:49.800
- like...
Uh-oh, you're back

17:49.800 --> 17:51.200
- going in, you're going in now.
- Shoot.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.033
- It's the other way.
- Okay. So...

17:53.033 --> 17:54.800
This is bad.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.900
It's definitely overwhelming

17:57.900 --> 18:00.233
figuring out how to do these
braids.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.767
I ruined this whole girl.
I... honestly thought it would

18:03.767 --> 18:08.000
be so much easier to learn,
but I feel like, with practice,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.667
- I know I can totally do it.
- You know what? I can

18:09.667 --> 18:11.667
give you one of these to take
home if you want to practice.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.167
- Really?
- And then at the

18:13.167 --> 18:15.167
- next session, I can just...
- Oh, my gosh, North...

18:15.167 --> 18:17.667
- Check it out for you.
- Yes! Thank you so much.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.167
- No problem. Any time.
- Like, this is super

18:20.167 --> 18:29.567
helpful.â™ª â™ª

18:29.567 --> 18:31.433
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.600
Oh, that's a cool
outfit.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.500
- Thanks.
- I like that, and it

18:35.500 --> 18:37.000
makes you look skinny and.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.800
Yeah. What's on the
bottom of your shoes?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.433
- What is it?
- 500 dots.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.567
- You just counted that?
- What are you  Rain Man?

18:44.567 --> 18:47.567
No. I didn't count your
dots. Those look like the

18:47.567 --> 18:49.167
- little velvet stickers.
- A weird chick.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.667
You know, that you put
under something.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.933
I actually put 500
velvet dots on there.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.267
How was, um...
the aviation show in London?

18:56.267 --> 18:57.933
- Oh. Insane.
- It was?

18:57.933 --> 18:59.933
One of the sickest
trips I've ever been on.

18:59.933 --> 19:01.567
- Really?
- Literally, every

19:01.567 --> 19:04.433
company that makes airplanes,
whether they're private jets,

19:04.433 --> 19:08.667
business jets, fighter jets, all
come to this show, and I just

19:08.667 --> 19:11.033
looked at, like, everything,
just 'cause, you know, it's not

19:11.033 --> 19:13.033
easy when you're shopping for a
jet, it's not like just going to

19:13.033 --> 19:15.733
a car dealership, so it's the
only time you can, kind of,

19:15.733 --> 19:19.233
- compare plane by plane...
- Wait. You're looking for

19:19.233 --> 19:21.433
- a plane?
- Yeah.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.433
- Why?
- I'm over cars. I've

19:23.433 --> 19:25.867
been there and done it. I've had
everything. Now the next step is

19:25.867 --> 19:29.067
airplanes, you know what I mean?
It's been fun trying to figure

19:29.067 --> 19:31.433
out what kind of aircraft I
want, what kind of configuration

19:31.433 --> 19:34.900
I want. And I'd obviously put
"Lord" on the side, nothing

19:34.900 --> 19:36.933
pretentious, you know what I
mean?

19:36.933 --> 19:39.100
I'm kind of getting
worried that Scott's missing the

19:39.100 --> 19:43.133
point. We didn't mean to fly to
London and go buy a jet. We all

19:43.133 --> 19:47.067
just miss the Scott that was
just so wild and fun, you know?

19:47.067 --> 19:49.567
- Not, like, extreme.
- I mean, I'm thinking

19:49.567 --> 19:51.767
about chartering a plane to get
to San Diego.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.700
Hmm. Well, I think
that's a bit (Eastern European

19:53.700 --> 19:56.267
- extravagant.
- It's definitely a bit

19:56.267 --> 19:59.567
extravagant, but Daddy needs a
plane.

19:59.567 --> 20:04.567
- â™ª â™ª- We got a ton of, like,

20:04.567 --> 20:07.267
super dope stuff for you to try
on.

20:07.267 --> 20:09.433
Yeah.
Honestly, I'm just

20:09.433 --> 20:13.967
more comfortable with the
baseball hat and sweat shorts.

20:13.967 --> 20:16.867
What's going on with my
brother? He just deleted all of

20:16.867 --> 20:18.367
- the pictures of Chyna...
- Oh, no.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.400
And everywhere in the
media, it says they're broken

20:20.400 --> 20:27.267
- up.
- Oh,.

20:33.867 --> 20:37.233
You have a ducky in
your pool. You got to see it.

20:37.233 --> 20:41.067
Oh! Let me get my
Snapchat.

20:41.067 --> 20:43.300
Hello, my little
friend.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.533
- It's a duck in the pool.
- The little guy.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.933
- With the big one.
- With the big duck!

20:47.933 --> 20:52.433
- Oh, he's cleaning himself.
- Quacker. Hi!

20:52.433 --> 20:54.333
Do you remember me?
No!

20:54.333 --> 20:57.733
No! Khloe! I wanted him
to feel comfortable.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.733
- It's really hot out here.
- It's really hot.

20:59.733 --> 21:01.700
I'm wearing a hat and
I'm hot.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.967
So, Kim sent all these
people to... for me to try these

21:04.967 --> 21:07.567
clothes on?
Nothing's gonna fit me, though,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.867
so... we'll be good.
It'll be real quick.

21:10.867 --> 21:14.233
- â™ª â™ª- I totally get why Rob

21:14.233 --> 21:16.767
doesn't have the best attitude
when it comes to this. He's

21:16.767 --> 21:20.233
uncomfortable in his own body.
Trying on clothes is really the

21:20.233 --> 21:23.733
last thing he wants to do. But
I'm gonna stay positive, and I

21:23.733 --> 21:26.567
hope that he finds something
he feels great in and he's

21:26.567 --> 21:29.100
gonna want to... come to
San Diego?

21:29.100 --> 21:33.133
We got a ton of, like, super
dope stuff for you to try on.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.833
- Yeah.
- So, what are you

21:34.833 --> 21:37.133
comfortable wearing? 'Cause all
you do is wear black right now.

21:37.133 --> 21:39.367
Are you com... like, do you just
want to stick with black?

21:39.367 --> 21:42.933
- I don't even know.
- Do you want to try on

21:42.933 --> 21:46.000
- a pair of jeans?
- I mean, honestly, I'm

21:46.000 --> 21:48.733
just more comfortable with the
baseball hat and sweat shorts

21:48.733 --> 21:51.600
- and sandals.
- But you can't just

21:51.600 --> 21:54.867
wear, like, a black T-shirt and
basketball shorts every day.

21:54.867 --> 21:59.700
- No. I get it...
- I'm a little confused

21:59.700 --> 22:02.633
by how Rob is acting. You know,
his complaint is that he has no

22:02.633 --> 22:06.233
clothes to wear to San Diego,
but now that he has options of

22:06.233 --> 22:09.333
clothes to wear, he's not even
willing to try on anything.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.633
I mean, I, like, wasn't
even comfortable, like...

22:11.633 --> 22:15.133
- over 100 pounds ago, so...
- If you just tell me,

22:15.133 --> 22:17.233
like, a genre... Like, if you
don't want to be in, like a suit

22:17.233 --> 22:19.100
- for this, that's fine.
- I'm just not

22:19.100 --> 22:22.400
comfortable, like... I don't
know.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.433
See, if only I
could take Celine's head...

22:34.433 --> 22:36.467
- Khadijah, what?
- Stick it in between

22:36.467 --> 22:39.167
my legs like this, then I would
be able to do this.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.433
Oh, for, like, a split
second, I thought that was,

22:41.433 --> 22:43.300
- like, a kid.
- I just said, if I

22:43.300 --> 22:45.067
- could get...
- Do you know my nanny was

22:45.067 --> 22:46.733
- holding that?
- Really?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.933
And the housekeeper
walked in and was, like, in the

22:49.933 --> 22:51.933
back, going, "Northie, you're
still here?"

22:51.933 --> 22:53.933
And then she was like,

22:53.933 --> 22:56.067
"Wait, no, it's a..."
You're like, "Uh,

22:56.067 --> 22:58.800
that is the furthest from what
my daughter looks like. Thanks."

22:58.800 --> 23:00.800
- I know.
- Wouldn't it be nice

23:00.800 --> 23:03.500
if you could give North two,
like, French braids?

23:03.500 --> 23:06.400
- That's, like, my dream.
- I wanted... I want

23:06.400 --> 23:09.400
- you to try and braid.
- Okay. So, uh, let me

23:09.400 --> 23:12.567
- show you how I would do it.
- Now, lay that one

23:12.567 --> 23:15.567
down.
And grab.

23:15.567 --> 23:19.867
â™ª â™ªKimberly, this is

23:19.867 --> 23:22.533
becoming a braid not attached to
her head.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.800
I know, I forgot this
side.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.167
I just don't get why this is,
like, still so difficult.

23:28.167 --> 23:31.667
I've been practicing a lot, and
my braiding skills are a

23:31.667 --> 23:34.900
disaster.
I just really hope that I can

23:34.900 --> 23:37.100
- figure this out.
- In a way does it

23:37.100 --> 23:39.100
bother you? Do you feel like, I
don't know how to do my

23:39.100 --> 23:40.600
- daughter's hair?
- Yeah.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.100
It's kind of
embarrassing.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.100
You know, I don't
think you need to be

23:44.100 --> 23:46.933
embarrassed, but I think you
guys would feel so much better

23:46.933 --> 23:49.000
do my
daughter's hair."

23:49.000 --> 23:57.833
Yeah.â™ª â™ª

23:57.833 --> 23:59.767
- Who is that?
- Scott.

23:59.767 --> 24:02.000
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Just roaming around.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.167
You're just bored, in
the area?

24:04.167 --> 24:07.567
You can play with Saint.
He's literally the best.

24:07.567 --> 24:10.867
But he said "Dada" the other
day, and I was like, "How dare

24:10.867 --> 24:13.533
you not say 'Mama' first?"

24:13.533 --> 24:15.567
Starting off young
with problems.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.900
Wait, what's going on
with my brother? He just deleted

24:17.900 --> 24:20.067
- all of the pictures of Chyna...
- Oh, no.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.433
And everywhere in the
media, it says they're broken

24:22.433 --> 24:24.433
- up.
- Oh,.

24:24.433 --> 24:29.400
Let's call Rob.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.200
I'm
sorry, the person you are trying

24:31.200 --> 24:32.700
- to...
- Something's going on.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.700
He's not answering my calls, and
I texted him...

24:34.700 --> 24:36.433
I just wrote him, too.
I'm supposed to look at houses

24:36.433 --> 24:38.433
- today at 4:00 with him.
- Does this mean he's

24:38.433 --> 24:39.933
not gonna come to San Diego,
probably?

24:39.933 --> 24:43.900
Totally.
I mean, I can call Chyna.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.233
I think we go for it.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.633
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:49.633 --> 24:52.033
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

24:52.033 --> 24:55.300
Um, about to start
getting my makeup done.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.700
- What are you doing?
- I just, um, am sitting

24:57.700 --> 25:00.100
here with Scott, but I've been
trying to get a hold of my

25:00.100 --> 25:03.767
brother, and he is totally MIA.
Oh, and then he deleted all of

25:03.767 --> 25:05.733
his Instagrams.
Like a lunatic.

25:05.733 --> 25:07.733
Yeah.
He does stuff for, like, a

25:07.733 --> 25:09.733
- reaction.
- Cry for help.

25:09.733 --> 25:11.333
Like, for example, he
asked me about his business

25:11.333 --> 25:14.267
stuff, and then I gave him my
honest opinion, and then he got

25:14.267 --> 25:16.500
upset with me.
Like, I'm just trying to be

25:16.500 --> 25:19.600
stress-free, 'cause Rob doesn't
realize, like, when he's not in

25:19.600 --> 25:21.867
a good mood, it affects
everybody.

25:21.867 --> 25:25.067
And I just don't want, like,
this stuff to transpire to the

25:25.067 --> 25:27.633
- baby, you know?
- Yeah, totally.

25:27.633 --> 25:30.800
Honestly, I think he
doesn't want to go to MJ's

25:30.800 --> 25:34.533
- birthday party on Tuesday.
- Stop.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.133
And I feel like that's
what this is all about.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.133
- Totally.
- "'Cause if I start an

25:38.133 --> 25:40.533
argument with Chyna, and I
really don't want to go..."

25:40.533 --> 25:42.867
- Totally.
- "...even more reason

25:42.867 --> 25:45.767
for me not to go to MJ's party
and I can blame it on Chyna

25:45.767 --> 25:48.367
maybe."
I just don't even know

25:48.367 --> 25:51.633
what to say.
I know that Rob and Chyna have,

25:51.633 --> 25:55.133
like, an unstable relationship.
There's obviously, two sides to

25:55.133 --> 25:57.933
every story.
And, you know, they just know

25:57.933 --> 26:00.500
how to push each other's
buttons, and my brother just,

26:00.500 --> 26:03.600
like, shuts down, and doesn't
really tell us because he

26:03.600 --> 26:06.600
doesn't want us to turn against
him or against her.

26:06.600 --> 26:13.500
So instead he just comes up with
all of these excuses.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.867
I really didn't feel
comfortable driving all the way

26:15.867 --> 26:18.133
down to San Diego.
If I had to look down and say,

26:18.133 --> 26:20.200
what would a lord do?
He'd charter an aircraft.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.167
We took the
airplane.

26:22.167 --> 26:24.533
That's crazy.
Guys, let's all move down one

26:24.533 --> 26:26.367
- seat.
- Why, who's here?

26:26.367 --> 26:28.033
- Who's here?
- Chyna.

26:28.033 --> 26:30.167
- And who's she with?
- Herself.

26:30.167 --> 26:34.033
- Because Rob canceled.
- Well, that's, that's a

26:34.033 --> 26:35.033
shame.

26:45.433 --> 26:49.233
Thanks, guys, for
flying the friendly skies.

26:49.233 --> 26:53.500
Quite frankly, with all this
Lord talk, I really didn't

26:53.500 --> 26:56.067
feel comfortable driving all the
way down to San Diego,

26:56.067 --> 26:58.767
especially with summer traffic.
All right, boys and girls, let's

26:58.767 --> 27:00.733
get going.
If I had to say what would a

27:00.733 --> 27:02.733
lord do, I know what he would
do.

27:02.733 --> 27:05.567
- He'd charter an aircraft.
- All right, guys.

27:05.567 --> 27:12.933
We're gonna rock and roll.â™ª â™ª

27:12.933 --> 27:14.467
- Mama.
- Yeah?

27:22.033 --> 27:23.700
I fall asleep before her
every night.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.533
Have you, um, talked to Rob?

27:26.533 --> 27:29.333
No.
I texted him my new number and,

27:29.333 --> 27:31.267
- like, he didn't respond.
- No, I've been texting

27:31.267 --> 27:32.933
him and calling him and he won't
answer.

27:32.933 --> 27:34.867
Hey.

27:34.867 --> 27:36.467
- Hi.
- Are you guys on your

27:36.467 --> 27:39.100
- way?
- Yeah, we're here.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.967
We landed and we're just driving
to the hotel.

27:41.967 --> 27:44.200
- You landed?
- Yeah, we took the

27:44.200 --> 27:47.133
- airplane and now we're here.
- What?

27:47.133 --> 27:51.300
That's crazy.
Okay, we'll see you soon.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.967
I know I really wanted
the Lord back, but I feel like

27:53.967 --> 27:56.467
- we're now creating a monster.
- I don't think, like...

27:56.467 --> 28:01.133
Scott's really understanding,
like, what we mean when we,

28:01.133 --> 28:03.033
- like, bring the Lord back.
- I don't want Scott to

28:03.033 --> 28:04.900
spend money.
I don't want Scott to be a

28:04.900 --> 28:07.000
douche bag again and be
obnoxious.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.633
All I want is, like, a little
personality.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.500
That's all.
Uh-oh. I can't control it.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.900
Oh! You just threw your
Shopkins...

28:12.900 --> 28:15.533
I can't control it!
Aah!

28:15.533 --> 28:24.900
I just can't!â™ª â™ª

28:24.900 --> 28:28.733
Come on, cheese.

28:28.733 --> 28:32.567
- Hold on. Hold my hand.
- We're all in San Diego

28:32.567 --> 28:35.000
at the La Valencia.
We used to stay here when we

28:35.000 --> 28:37.333
were kids.
I love spending time with my

28:37.333 --> 28:40.600
grandma and the whole family,
but I wish my brother was here.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.467
- What's up?
- Let's get this show on

28:42.467 --> 28:44.533
- the road.
- Hey. I know.

28:44.533 --> 28:47.700
You look great.
So, just so you guys know, um,

28:47.700 --> 28:49.633
- Chyna is gonna...
- You guys are drinking

28:49.633 --> 28:51.333
- tequila in here?
- ...meet us-- yeah-- at

28:51.333 --> 28:52.733
- the restaurant.
- Yeah.

28:52.733 --> 28:56.933
- So she's coming without him?
- Yeah.

28:56.933 --> 28:58.633
Well, you know what?
Here's the thing.

28:58.633 --> 29:01.267
She really wanted to come and
show her support for MJ and say

29:01.267 --> 29:03.533
"happy birthday" and be with all
of us.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.433
It's nice that
she's... it's nice that she's...

29:05.433 --> 29:07.767
- making an effort.
- I mean, I just think

29:07.767 --> 29:10.767
that Rob just, like, honestly
has to just start being honest.

29:10.767 --> 29:13.067
Like, enough with the excuses.
Like, we're never gonna believe

29:13.067 --> 29:14.700
him.
If you don't want to come, just

29:14.700 --> 29:16.933
say, "I don't want to come."
That's what pisses me off so bad

29:16.933 --> 29:19.133
- about him.
- She's trying to make an

29:19.133 --> 29:21.533
effort for the both of them,
because I think she's just

29:21.533 --> 29:24.100
throwing... you know, a towel in
the air, going, "I don't even

29:24.100 --> 29:25.633
know what to do."
You think she just

29:25.633 --> 29:27.200
threw a towel in the air?

29:27.200 --> 29:37.833
Well, whatever it is.â™ª â™ª

29:37.833 --> 29:40.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.467
- Happy birthday!
- Look at this.

29:42.467 --> 29:44.200
Oh, my gosh.
And the balloons...

29:44.200 --> 29:46.200
"Happy birthday, MJ!"

29:46.200 --> 29:49.167
- Happy birthday, MJ!
- Happy birthday.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.667
- Cheers.
- It's my MJ's birthday!

29:51.667 --> 29:54.800
You look beautiful.
MJ, look how hot you look.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.367
- I know. I know.
- No, really.

29:57.367 --> 29:58.967
- I'm just kidding.
- It's wild.

29:58.967 --> 30:00.867
So are you looking
forward to the races, girls?

30:00.867 --> 30:03.267
Your mother and I grew up there.

30:03.267 --> 30:04.933
- Yes, we did.
- My mom found a husband

30:04.933 --> 30:06.667
there.
Yeah.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.033
If we're going to feed
them, can we move them down one?

30:09.033 --> 30:11.333
Guys, let's all move
down one seat.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.200
- Why, who's here?
- Who's here?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.600
Chyna, but she can sit
there.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.567
- And who's she with?
- Herself.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.333
- Because Rob canceled.
- Well, that's-that's a

30:20.333 --> 30:22.833
shame.
That's a shame.

30:22.833 --> 30:24.567
Rob should've been the one to
come.

30:24.567 --> 30:26.967
Well, guess what.
Look at the glass half-full.

30:26.967 --> 30:28.833
- All right.
- I don't want any

30:28.833 --> 30:33.300
negative waves.
It really makes me sad when Rob

30:33.300 --> 30:37.233
misses any event, and especially
a family celebration.

30:37.233 --> 30:44.800
But I need to be as positive as
possible to make my mom happy.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.900
- â™ª â™ª- You are now...

30:48.900 --> 30:51.367
The Duke!
Duke Disick!

30:51.367 --> 30:53.367
What?
What does this really mean?

30:53.367 --> 30:56.333
- Is there something more to this?
- We just want you to

30:56.333 --> 30:58.700
- just... be fun.
- Hi.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.700
- Hi.
- It sucks that Rob's

31:00.700 --> 31:02.067
- late.
- He blocked you, too.

31:02.067 --> 31:08.133
But why would he block
us?

31:08.133 --> 31:12.467
- â™ª â™ª- Hi.

31:12.467 --> 31:14.467
- Hi.
- Hi!

31:14.467 --> 31:18.900
Happy birthday.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.033
- Thank you for coming.
- Happy birthday, MJ.

31:21.033 --> 31:23.200
- Thank you for coming.
- Hi, everybody.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.933
I don't know where to start.
Hi, boo.

31:24.933 --> 31:26.700
How are you?
You look so cute.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.500
It sucks that Rob's late, but
it's, like, so nice that Chyna

31:29.500 --> 31:32.400
made this effort to come down
and spend my grandma's birthday

31:32.400 --> 31:34.467
- with us.
- When you were texting

31:34.467 --> 31:37.833
- Rob, did it go through?
- I texted him the night

31:37.833 --> 31:39.833
before I called you and was
like, "Have you talked to him?"

31:39.833 --> 31:41.333
Mm-hmm.
- This was what I sent

31:41.333 --> 31:42.933
him.
And I thought he would at least

31:42.933 --> 31:44.700
respond, because it was, like, a
cute baby pic.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.367
- No, that's super cute.
- You know what?

31:46.367 --> 31:49.800
I almost feel like he likes it
when we're all stalking him.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.667
I texted him
yesterday.

31:51.667 --> 31:54.167
But try to text again
now... and see if it says

31:54.167 --> 31:55.933
"delivered."

31:55.933 --> 31:59.400
I'm like, this dude... like, he
blocked all my friends.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.967
- Oh, he blocked you, too.
- Why would he block us?

32:02.967 --> 32:05.533
- Khlo, what is that?
- What?

32:05.533 --> 32:07.533
- Why?
- Grandma, he's a

32:07.533 --> 32:09.600
- little off.
- Tell... uh, tell him,

32:09.600 --> 32:11.833
Chyna, that Mary Jo wants to
talk to him.

32:11.833 --> 32:14.133
He blocked me, too.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.033
- He blocked us.
- What is he doing?

32:16.033 --> 32:19.400
Does Rob normally,
like, just run away like that?

32:19.400 --> 32:21.667
That's how he's been for
the last, like, three years.

32:21.667 --> 32:24.800
Like, he came to my wedding.
He went to a fitting.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.300
- Yeah.
- And he left.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.467
- It's just...
- That's crazy.

32:29.467 --> 32:31.667
He is.
I don't even know, like, what

32:31.667 --> 32:34.067
- the answer is.
- Yeah.

32:34.067 --> 32:36.800
It was really nice,
though, that you came to, um, my

32:36.800 --> 32:40.467
grandma's birthday...
that you drove all the way

32:40.467 --> 32:43.033
- out, even without Rob.
- So sweet.

32:43.033 --> 32:44.833
- Chyna...
- Chyna, she's opening

32:44.833 --> 32:46.167
- your gift.
- Oh, me?

32:46.167 --> 32:48.367
Oh, my gosh.
Stop it, you guys, but keep it

32:48.367 --> 32:51.500
coming.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.867
- Do you like it?
- So cute. I love it.

32:53.867 --> 32:55.633
Ooh!
Look how cute.

32:55.633 --> 32:57.633
- Thank you, darling.
- You're welcome.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.567
Happy birthday.
From me and Rob.

32:59.567 --> 33:01.633
Yeah. From both of you.
Thank you so much.

33:01.633 --> 33:03.967
And baby.
Look, I have to show you this.

33:03.967 --> 33:06.467
So this is the front face of the
baby.

33:06.467 --> 33:09.467
- It's like the...
- So cute. Beautiful.

33:09.467 --> 33:10.800
Uh-huh.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.267
- Make me gonna cry.
- I'm disappointed that

33:14.267 --> 33:20.767
Rob wasn't able to come down,
but nevertheless, my mom has had

33:20.767 --> 33:25.367
the best, best birthday and that
makes me so happy.

33:25.367 --> 33:29.300
And almost all the rest of the
family is here, so... I think we

33:29.300 --> 33:34.567
did a really good job.

33:34.567 --> 33:39.633
Make a wish.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.767
Take a picture of the
cake.

33:41.767 --> 33:45.033
Happy birthday, Mom.
We love you.

33:53.867 --> 33:57.900
Oh!
Wow, you look nice.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.833
- So dapper!
- What the hell is this?

34:01.833 --> 34:04.633
What do you think this
royal crest means?

34:04.633 --> 34:07.467
Whoa, I don't know,
but it looks like my last name

34:07.467 --> 34:09.900
- and I'm loving it.
- You are now...

34:09.900 --> 34:11.900
- The Duke!
- ...the Duke.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.967
- Duke Disick.
- What?

34:13.967 --> 34:16.333
Scott is out of
control, so Kim and I are

34:16.333 --> 34:20.800
thinking, let's make this a fun
thing.

34:20.800 --> 34:24.000
What's higher than a lord?
A duke.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.433
Let's get Lord a duke title.
He can be the Lord and the Duke,

34:27.433 --> 34:29.867
but at least maybe the Duke has,
like, a clean slate.

34:29.867 --> 34:33.967
And he could be...
whatever persona he wants to be

34:33.967 --> 34:36.300
- as the Duke.
- I don't think I want

34:36.300 --> 34:40.300
- to be referred to as the Dooken.
- As the Dookie.

34:40.300 --> 34:43.100
Right.
Except she was like...

34:43.100 --> 34:46.333
- The Dookie.
- Are you okay?

34:46.333 --> 34:48.333
What about the Double
Ds?

34:48.333 --> 34:51.333
- The Double Ds.
- Scott, you got some

34:51.333 --> 34:53.733
- Double Ds.
How-how are you, Duke

34:53.733 --> 34:56.900
- Disick?
- Double.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.700
Right.
What does this really mean?

34:59.700 --> 35:02.367
- Is there something more to this?
- It's like us saying we

35:02.367 --> 35:05.033
miss the Lord, that doesn't mean
we need you to be, like, like,

35:05.033 --> 35:08.367
big ballin' and, like, trying to
buy planes.

35:08.367 --> 35:12.067
We just want you to... just
be fun.

35:12.067 --> 35:14.133
I'm not gonna lie, I'm
definitely the type of guy that

35:14.133 --> 35:18.167
covers some of my problems with
materialistic items.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.533
And I'm pretty sure when the
family came to me and said they

35:21.533 --> 35:24.733
wanted more of the Lord, they
really just kind of more so

35:24.733 --> 35:28.167
wanted to get me out of, like,
the little funk that I was in.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.700
Yeah, I definitely appreciate
that they notice and care.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.533
I can't ask for much more than
that.

35:33.533 --> 35:36.633
I realize I don't have to go
that far with the whole Lord

35:36.633 --> 35:38.900
thing, and I can calm down and
just be myself.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.500
Just a... Just a
dookie.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.000
There's nothing wrong
with a good ol' clean dook.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.667
No.

35:52.833 --> 35:56.000
Oh, I can't stand
looking like this.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.333
I think I need my hair up or
something.

35:58.333 --> 36:02.667
There's just, like, no makeup in
Nantucket.

36:02.667 --> 36:05.100
First of all,
Nantucket.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.400
You're talking,
looking like this?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.367
But I'm not
complaining about it.

36:09.367 --> 36:12.633
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Kathy called

36:12.633 --> 36:15.067
me last night looking for Rob,
and so did the twins.

36:15.067 --> 36:18.067
And I said, "Oh, he hasn't been
around, I haven't seen him."

36:18.067 --> 36:21.300
We can't, like, act like what
he's doing isn't wrong.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.967
If this was any man that we were
with, we would be pissed.

36:23.967 --> 36:25.800
- How dare...
- I don't even know

36:25.800 --> 36:27.367
- what he's doing.
- He hasn't spoken to

36:27.367 --> 36:28.933
- her in days.
- Why?

36:28.933 --> 36:30.633
How dare you leave
a preg-- I don't give a.

36:30.633 --> 36:34.500
You still need to check on her.
Would you be happy with Kanye if

36:34.500 --> 36:37.133
he disappeared for five days and
never reached out to you?

36:37.133 --> 36:38.800
- No, I'd die.
- Right.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.967
I don't care if it's our
brother; facts are facts.

36:40.967 --> 36:45.100
- It's crazy how he's acting.
- That's so  up.

36:45.100 --> 36:49.133
Rob is going to be a dad, and he
has a family to answer to, so I

36:49.133 --> 36:52.733
feel like now, more than ever,
Rob can't handle things the way

36:52.733 --> 36:54.500
he once did.
He has to deal with his

36:54.500 --> 36:56.100
problems.
He can't just run away and

36:56.100 --> 36:58.100
ignore them.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.333
- Buenos dÃ­as.
- Rob, why did you

37:03.333 --> 37:06.100
disappear?
It's ridiculous that he keeps

37:06.100 --> 37:21.567
doing this disappearing act.
What the hell is going on?

37:21.567 --> 37:23.367
Do you love how Mommy
did your braids?

37:23.367 --> 37:26.000
I love your braids.
You love your braids Mama did?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.900
Okay, let's go to KoKo's room
and say "Let's go, guys."

37:28.900 --> 37:32.533
Hi, you!
I couldn't make it down

37:32.533 --> 37:35.567
for MJ's birthday dinner,
but I wanted to make sure that I

37:35.567 --> 37:37.867
could make it down for the races
to at least see her for a little

37:37.867 --> 37:39.767
bit.
And it's just nice to have a fun

37:39.767 --> 37:42.467
day out like this.
It's kind of like dressing up,

37:42.467 --> 37:46.500
and I love horses and being
around them, so yeah, it's cool.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.767
Oh, my God, it's my
baby!

37:49.767 --> 37:52.333
- My baby's here. Hi.
- What do you think

37:52.333 --> 37:54.300
- of her hair?
- Give me my hug or

37:54.300 --> 37:55.900
we're going to have a problem.
I need a hug.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.300
I did her hair myself.
Do you like it?

37:57.300 --> 37:58.700
You did?
Oh, it's so good.

37:58.700 --> 38:02.700
I worked so hard on
these braids, and it's, like,

38:02.700 --> 38:05.233
such a fun experience in the
morning with North and I, like,

38:05.233 --> 38:07.667
just getting her ready and
getting her hair done.

38:07.667 --> 38:09.867
And I'm just excited for
everyone to see them.

38:09.867 --> 38:13.067
I went to a hair tutorial place.
Kim Kimble-- she taught me how

38:13.067 --> 38:15.600
to make braids.
I mean, I think anything with

38:15.600 --> 38:18.700
parenting just takes time.
You're not gonna know how to do

38:18.700 --> 38:21.900
everything overnight.
All you can really do is try

38:21.900 --> 38:24.267
your best and just keep on
learning and keep on practicing,

38:24.267 --> 38:26.267
and that's really all you can
hope for.

38:26.267 --> 38:28.267
All right, should we
go?

38:28.267 --> 38:32.933
- Uh, let's go outside!
- Let's go outside!

38:40.433 --> 38:44.233
MJ...!
Hi!

38:44.233 --> 38:46.233
I was saying, "That girl
looks like Kendall."

38:46.233 --> 38:48.233
- Mwah.
- How are you?

38:48.233 --> 38:50.500
- Happy birthday!
- I'm so glad to see you.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
I'm so happy to see
you.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.067
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Oh, my God!

38:56.067 --> 38:58.433
- It's the Duke!
- How the hell are you?

38:58.433 --> 39:00.567
The Duke!
Oh, my goodness, Dookie!

39:00.567 --> 39:02.567
I haven't rocked
anything like this in a long

39:02.567 --> 39:05.167
time.
I'm throwing Duke way out of the

39:05.167 --> 39:08.600
water.
I'm not a duke.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.733
I'll stay the Lord.
I want to say, from the deepest

39:10.733 --> 39:14.400
bottom of my heart, thank you
for bringing the Lord back.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.333
It feels so good.
You know, I'm happy that

39:17.333 --> 39:20.000
everybody supports the Lord.
'Cause I've always been the

39:20.000 --> 39:22.200
Lord, and the Lord is here to
stay.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.667
- And that's it.
- Scott, do you want to

39:24.667 --> 39:27.067
- bet?
- I like the first one.

39:27.067 --> 39:29.767
Put some money on number one for
me.

39:29.767 --> 39:33.567
Luminance to the

39:33.567 --> 39:35.567
- inside gate.
- Okay, I think it's gonna

39:35.567 --> 39:41.867
start soon, bub.

39:41.867 --> 39:45.167
- Who's winning?
- I have no idea!

39:45.167 --> 39:47.167
Who are you yelling

39:47.167 --> 39:49.167
- for?
- One and two!

39:49.167 --> 39:53.700
- Those are ours!
- Number one won.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.800
- We won!
- Looks like somebody's

39:55.800 --> 39:59.767
- buying themselves an aircraft.
- Mom, this is so fun!

39:59.767 --> 40:02.300
- Do you like it?
- Scott and I won.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.933
I didn't win.
Aw, man.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.933
- All right.
- I want to collect!

40:06.933 --> 40:09.200
- Collection!
- We won.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.333
- I'm going home ahead.
- We won.

40:11.333 --> 40:15.167
Wow.
It was a good luck item to come

40:15.167 --> 40:18.000
- back as the Lord today.
- See?

40:28.200 --> 40:31.167
What the 's wrong
with your door?

40:31.167 --> 40:34.467
- Buenos dÃ­as.
- Hey, Rob.

40:34.467 --> 40:38.633
Ooh, you're back and
in full effect.

40:38.633 --> 40:45.933
Why didn't you go to San Diego?â™ª â™ª

40:45.933 --> 40:49.767
Of course, now that we're back
in L.A., Rob conveniently is

40:49.767 --> 40:52.800
found and answers his phone and
unblocks all of us all of a

40:52.800 --> 40:55.100
sudden.
It's ridiculous that he keeps

40:55.100 --> 41:07.167
doing this disappearing act.
Rob, why did you disappear?

41:07.167 --> 41:11.233
Rob, why did you
disappear?

41:11.233 --> 41:13.367
I just didn't want to
hear from everyone about

41:13.367 --> 41:15.933
anything regarding anything, so
I choose to block everybody and

41:15.933 --> 41:17.933
- that's it.
- Why didn't you go to

41:17.933 --> 41:19.933
- San Diego?
- 'Cause I went to Vegas

41:19.933 --> 41:21.933
- instead.
- So that's more

41:21.933 --> 41:24.267
important than your
grandmother's 82nd birthday?

41:24.267 --> 41:28.100
No, I just didn't feel
like going because, um, me and

41:28.100 --> 41:30.167
Chyna just got in a little... a
little disagreement.

41:30.167 --> 41:32.667
That was it.
So I was just like, "I'm just

41:32.667 --> 41:34.800
gonna leave."
She just gave me a reason to not

41:34.800 --> 41:37.233
want to go with her to San
Diego.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.967
I was just like, "All right, my
boys are going to Vegas.

41:39.967 --> 41:41.967
Road trip. I'm good."
So you really went to

41:41.967 --> 41:45.467
- Vegas?
- He really did.

41:45.467 --> 41:47.833
I just feel like you
need to communicate more and

41:47.833 --> 41:50.333
tell us, like, when you're going
through something so we can help

41:50.333 --> 41:52.367
you.
Like, if you don't want to go to

41:52.367 --> 41:54.367
San Diego, that's fine, but
maybe, like, tell us.

41:54.367 --> 41:55.867
Yeah, just be like,
"Everyone off my back."

41:55.867 --> 41:58.467
Obviously I get it.
Communication, sending a text

41:58.467 --> 42:01.633
message.
But with you guys, if I said,

42:01.633 --> 42:04.033
"Oh, I'm gonna take a couple
days off," then everyone would

42:04.033 --> 42:06.367
freak out, think something's
wrong.

42:06.367 --> 42:08.533
"What's wrong with Rob?"
Show up in my bedroom.

42:08.533 --> 42:12.500
Like, you guys are just... it
just gets very dramatic.

42:16.567 --> 42:19.333
If Rob feels that we
are really dramatic and

42:19.333 --> 42:23.133
judgmental, I feel like we all
have to take heed to that.

42:23.133 --> 42:26.400
What's done is done, and I'm
just happy that Rob is now able

42:26.400 --> 42:30.067
to talk to us about things.
I really hope though that we

42:30.067 --> 42:33.833
each learn something from this.
I hope Rob knows that he doesn't

42:33.833 --> 42:36.233
have to just block every family
member that exists.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.700
Okay, so how are you and Chyna
now, good?

42:38.700 --> 42:40.700
- Yeah, we're all good.
- But you guys keep

42:40.700 --> 42:42.700
going... Like, I feel like you
guys have high highs and low

42:42.700 --> 42:44.700
lows.
How can we, like, keep it, like,

42:44.700 --> 42:46.700
- even?
- You guys just can't push

42:46.700 --> 42:48.700
- each other's buttons.
- No, I push her buttons

42:48.700 --> 42:51.233
all the time.
She pushes mine all the time.

42:51.233 --> 42:53.233
- You know?
- Do you think life is

42:53.233 --> 42:56.433
- better with four kids or two?
- Life is better with

42:56.433 --> 42:59.667
me.
No kids.

42:59.667 --> 43:02.600
I just think, for
me, four or six.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.167
You?

43:05.167 --> 43:06.833
Oh, Khloe's whole
ass was out.

43:06.833 --> 43:09.333
- My ass was out?
- Your whole entire

43:09.333 --> 43:11.600
- ass.
- I'm wearing Spanx, but

43:11.600 --> 43:14.133
- he pulled up my shirt.
- Oh.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.600
I have a good ass, so
you guys are fine.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.267
- Coming up next week...
- I didn't know water

43:19.267 --> 43:21.600
aerobics was so sexual.
I just don't know if it's the

43:21.600 --> 43:23.900
most appropriate thing spending
time with women that are, like,

43:23.900 --> 43:26.167
- 20 years older than me.
- Like, since when

43:26.167 --> 43:28.467
were you interested in water
aerobics?

43:28.467 --> 43:30.833
Yeah, that's a little
odd.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.033
The sleep paralysis
is, like, really getting to me.

43:33.033 --> 43:35.933
- Nothing can move.
- You have a week in

43:35.933 --> 43:38.700
- Paris, Milan, and then London.
- I can't travel that

43:38.700 --> 43:40.700
- much.
- Well, you're already

43:40.700 --> 43:42.700
- booked.
- I'm, like, scared.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.700
I'm freaking out.
