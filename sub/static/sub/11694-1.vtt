03:49.030 --> 03:50.939
Admiral Yamamoto, please.

03:51.366 --> 03:55.114
He asked not to be disturbed.
- lt is most urgent.

04:16.182 --> 04:18.471
Admiral Yamamoto?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.265
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When?

04:21.688 --> 04:25.685
10 minutes ago. Yokohama, Kawasaki
and Yokosuka were also bombed.

04:26.234 --> 04:31.062
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed.
l personally phoned the palace.

04:32.574 --> 04:36.108
Damage? - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities,

04:36.536 --> 04:40.368
but it seems probable
that they too were barely scratched.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.332
How did they do it, Watanabe?

04:43.751 --> 04:47.583
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.

04:48.006 --> 04:51.873
They came in at treetop level,
and were first seen over the city.

04:52.302 --> 04:54.175
Tokyo ... bombed!

04:54.596 --> 04:58.545
Sir, l understand your concern
for the Emperor's safety, but ...

04:58.975 --> 05:03.720
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.

05:04.147 --> 05:07.314
The Americans have
proven you correct.

05:07.734 --> 05:13.487
Dur homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff

05:13.948 --> 05:17.198
will certainly approve
your operation M-l.

05:22.707 --> 05:27.998
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle
led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s

05:28.421 --> 05:30.544
and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.

05:30.965 --> 05:34.714
Most of the planes carried
500-pound demolition bombs

05:35.136 --> 05:37.093
and single incendiary clusters,

05:37.514 --> 05:42.970
which were dropped on oil stores,
factories and military sites in Tokyo.

05:43.394 --> 05:47.772
A few planes made minor strikes
on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya,

05:48.191 --> 05:51.939
with one bomb hitting
the Japanese carrier Ryuko.

05:52.362 --> 05:57.237
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale,

05:57.659 --> 06:01.656
while at the same time constituting
a blow to Japanese prestige.

06:11.005 --> 06:12.665
Thanks, Sir.

06:16.219 --> 06:20.845
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:

06:21.266 --> 06:27.636
''Can you tell us, where did
those planes start from and go to?''

06:28.064 --> 06:31.148
He replied:
''Yes, the time has come to tell you.

06:31.568 --> 06:35.435
They came from our new
secret base at Shangri-la ...''

06:36.614 --> 06:38.821
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth!

06:39.242 --> 06:43.703
l was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!

06:44.122 --> 06:45.581
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!

06:45.999 --> 06:50.744
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to ...
- To chew my ass off, huh?

06:51.421 --> 06:55.917
Dfficially, l'm supposed to question
your estimate of Japanese intentions.

06:56.342 --> 07:01.300
Why so grim, Matt? Doolittle's attack
should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.

07:02.223 --> 07:05.260
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.

07:05.685 --> 07:10.312
We only got 4 carriers
in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.

07:10.732 --> 07:15.109
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's
going to jump back at us. But where?

07:16.446 --> 07:18.688
We got the latest intercepts here.

07:22.702 --> 07:25.407
Here's a list of Japanese ships

07:25.830 --> 07:32.034
we suspect will be assigned
to amphib operations south of Rabaul.

07:32.462 --> 07:37.290
The Coral Sea! That's where
we think they'll strike next.

07:38.343 --> 07:41.712
But something else is stirring,
something out our way.

07:42.138 --> 07:44.095
We need facts, not guesswork.

07:44.516 --> 07:49.510
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code,
but we can't just reel it off.

07:49.938 --> 07:53.271
We get a flicker here
and a glimmer there.

07:53.691 --> 07:56.396
How much can you decipher?
- Hell, 15, maybe ...

07:56.820 --> 07:59.655
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.

08:00.073 --> 08:05.233
10 per ... That's one word in 10.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!

08:08.748 --> 08:10.954
We like to call it ''analysis''.

08:11.376 --> 08:16.168
Alright. What are these indications
that something's brewing out our way?

08:16.589 --> 08:19.792
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe?

08:20.218 --> 08:24.547
lncreased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all?

08:24.973 --> 08:29.967
Could be significant. At least
l feel that something's stirring.

08:30.395 --> 08:31.557
Alright,

08:32.355 --> 08:36.056
l'll take that list of Jap ships
you ''feel'' are headed for Coral Sea.

08:36.484 --> 08:41.561
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force
to see what's going on.

08:41.990 --> 08:45.655
We'll see how your 10-percent
guesswork pays off, huh?

08:46.077 --> 08:49.909
As a back-room code-cracker
l thank you, Matt.

08:50.331 --> 08:54.792
Joe, could l ask you
something very personal? - Certainly.

08:56.087 --> 09:00.796
lt really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath?

09:01.217 --> 09:04.882
Bath? God, l don't know ...
What day is it?

09:05.847 --> 09:07.471
Forget it, Joe.

09:12.854 --> 09:15.309
Any new Yamamoto intercepts?

09:15.732 --> 09:20.643
Here's a first mention of ''A-F'',
whatever that means.

09:21.070 --> 09:22.944
A-F?

09:51.476 --> 09:52.638
Captain!

09:56.231 --> 09:57.096
Tom!

09:57.524 --> 09:58.769
Dad ...

10:00.443 --> 10:04.939
My God, Tom.
When did you get in? l didn't know ...

10:05.365 --> 10:11.485
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why
didn't you write that you were coming?

10:12.831 --> 10:18.169
l've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, l'll finally see some of you.

10:18.628 --> 10:19.873
Three years!

10:20.672 --> 10:25.215
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.

10:31.891 --> 10:34.382
Kaneohe, are you? What squadron?
- VF-8.

10:35.895 --> 10:41.234
You'll like it. Your C.D. used to be
my wing-man on the old Langley.

10:43.945 --> 10:45.439
Could we talk somewhere?

10:46.114 --> 10:48.403
Sure ... Here.

10:54.998 --> 10:58.283
l phoned you from Guam
the day you graduated.

10:58.710 --> 11:03.621
Yeah, l heard later.
l'm sorry l missed the call.

11:04.048 --> 11:06.884
l guess your mother was there?

11:07.302 --> 11:09.674
Yeah.
- How is she?

11:11.765 --> 11:15.548
Recovered from the divorce, l guess.
- That's good.

11:17.103 --> 11:20.389
l was hoping maybe we could ...
- Dad,

11:25.695 --> 11:31.401
l've fallen in love with
a Japanese girl. l want to marry her.

11:35.663 --> 11:37.989
l need your help.

11:40.335 --> 11:42.327
l damn well guess you do, Tiger.

11:44.255 --> 11:46.047
She's been arrested in Honolulu.

11:47.133 --> 11:48.711
How did you manage that?

11:49.135 --> 11:53.548
ln San Diego and getting mixed up
with a Japanese girl in Honolulu?

11:53.973 --> 11:58.968
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here?

11:59.395 --> 12:04.188
Her parents live here. She wouldn't
marry me without their permission.

12:04.609 --> 12:09.816
Apparently, the FBl has something
on her folks, so they got picked up.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.520
Well, that figures.

12:12.283 --> 12:15.699
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.

12:17.580 --> 12:21.993
Anyway, the minute l got in l went
to see where they're being held.

12:23.545 --> 12:26.380
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not?

12:26.798 --> 12:28.625
l don't know.

12:29.926 --> 12:35.086
She and her parents will be sent
back to the mainland in a few days.

12:38.476 --> 12:42.011
lt sticks in your throat
that l want to marry a Japanese girl?

12:42.438 --> 12:46.768
Sticks in your ...? Don't give me
that ''racial bigot'' crap.

12:47.235 --> 12:49.726
l don't care what color she is.
- lt's not the point ...

12:50.155 --> 12:52.396
Christ almighty!

12:52.824 --> 12:56.822
6 months after Pearl Harbor!
Boy, you have lousy timing.

13:02.917 --> 13:06.832
What's her name?
l'll see if l can get her FBl report.

13:07.255 --> 13:10.126
l wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.

13:13.094 --> 13:14.672
But promise one thing:

13:15.096 --> 13:19.557
Don't do anything stupid
till l see what l can get hold of.

13:19.976 --> 13:21.554
That's a deal.

13:53.301 --> 13:59.754
ln my opinion, the plan is not only
unnecessary, but doomed to fail.

14:00.183 --> 14:05.426
Admiral Kondo, Dperation M-l
was conceived by our best strategist.

14:05.855 --> 14:11.644
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's
authorship and his reputation.

14:12.070 --> 14:16.233
But this time, the god of operations
has conceived a monster.

14:18.493 --> 14:19.904
Would you please explain?

14:20.328 --> 14:23.827
How am l expected to land
my invasion forces on Midway,

14:24.249 --> 14:28.412
unless the enemy airfields and
shore batteries have been neutralized?

14:29.754 --> 14:34.215
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers
will obliterate the American defenses.

14:34.634 --> 14:39.379
The enemy's land-based bombers
have a range of 400 miles more

14:39.806 --> 14:41.597
than Nagumo's carrier planes.

14:42.016 --> 14:46.144
His ships would be blown out of
the sea before he launches his attack.

14:46.563 --> 14:52.233
l destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii,
where the risk was far greater.

14:52.652 --> 14:55.143
Where were the land-based bombers?

14:55.572 --> 15:01.242
A surprise attack with
a carrier task force is one thing.

15:01.661 --> 15:05.030
But this, a strike
against Midway and the Aleutians

15:05.457 --> 15:08.825
with 200 ships and 100,000 men.

15:12.714 --> 15:18.467
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians
cause you concern, Hosogaya?

15:19.095 --> 15:26.806
No, Sir. But an operation so complex,
l'd like more time to study it.

15:27.228 --> 15:31.440
After all, in a matter of hours
our Coral Sea operation begins.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.391
We have sufficient forces for both.

15:34.819 --> 15:38.568
l tend to agree
with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya.

15:40.950 --> 15:44.995
l suggest we meet again
after the Coral Sea campaign.

15:46.498 --> 15:50.032
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:

15:50.460 --> 15:53.330
The Americans are still
unprepared and outnumbered.

15:53.755 --> 15:58.832
lf their fleet can be lured
into battle and defeated,

15:59.427 --> 16:02.962
they will have no significant
naval force left in the Pacific.

16:03.389 --> 16:05.512
They will have to sue for peace.

16:06.518 --> 16:10.349
l have traveled widely in America,
my friends.

16:10.772 --> 16:14.390
Their industrial might is awesome.

16:14.817 --> 16:21.235
l'm convinced our only hope of victory
is one massive strike at Midway.

16:52.397 --> 16:56.311
Joe, are you sure this
''hot information'' of yours can't wait?

16:56.734 --> 17:01.147
l already got one thing for the boss.
- l consider this urgent.

17:01.573 --> 17:05.071
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.944
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt?

17:09.372 --> 17:11.412
We got hurt.

17:19.257 --> 17:21.546
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight?

17:21.968 --> 17:24.090
Long and full of potholes.

17:24.512 --> 17:28.462
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report?
- Right here, Sir.

17:35.732 --> 17:40.477
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till l cue you in.

17:45.950 --> 17:49.236
Here's Admiral Fletcher's
preliminary report, Sir.

17:49.662 --> 17:51.904
We lost the Lexington.

17:52.957 --> 17:54.155
What about the enemy?

17:55.043 --> 17:59.918
We sank one light carrier, one big
first-line job and some small ships.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.506
Looks like
we just about broke even, Admiral.

18:04.344 --> 18:08.258
We can't trade the Japanese
carrier for carrier, Matt.

18:08.681 --> 18:12.300
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.

18:12.727 --> 18:15.728
With the Lexington gone,
the Saratoga laid up,

18:16.147 --> 18:21.105
all we've got is the Hornet,
the Enterprise and the Yorktown.

18:21.528 --> 18:27.648
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged
at Coral Sea. There's the report.

18:31.496 --> 18:34.366
Admiral, Commander Rochefort
has something urgent, he says.

18:34.791 --> 18:37.994
lt's about objective A-F,
the meaning of ''A-F''.

18:38.419 --> 18:43.959
Dur listening posts pick up traffic
between Yamamoto's flag commanders.

18:44.634 --> 18:50.055
There's been a heavy traffic volume,
with references to object ''A-F'' ...

18:50.473 --> 18:54.601
... and A-D. A-D is a mystery,
maybe a diversion.

18:55.019 --> 18:59.397
But l think we've identified ''A-F''.
lt's Midway.

18:59.816 --> 19:05.439
lt had us stymied until one of my men
remembered an intercept from March.

19:05.864 --> 19:10.075
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed
his base that he's close to ''A-F''.

19:10.493 --> 19:13.660
We plotted every course
the plane could have have taken,

19:14.080 --> 19:17.829
and the only appreciable landmass
he could have flown over was Midway.

19:18.251 --> 19:22.747
Joe! - l know it's thin.
- Thin? Damn near invisible!

19:23.173 --> 19:26.755
But l figured out
a way to confirm it, Sir.

19:27.177 --> 19:32.052
lf you have this flown to Midway.
lt's a fake message, Admiral,

19:32.473 --> 19:36.637
reporting that Midway's
freshwater condenser's broken down.

19:37.061 --> 19:43.942
lt should be transmitted in the clear,
so the Japanese get every word.

19:44.694 --> 19:49.321
lnstruct Midway to include this in
their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.

19:49.741 --> 19:51.484
Aye-aye, Sir.

20:17.143 --> 20:19.765
Send this right away.

20:20.188 --> 20:21.433
Hey, chief!

20:21.856 --> 20:23.185
What's this?

20:23.608 --> 20:27.356
There ain't nothin' wrong
with our freshwater condenser!

20:27.779 --> 20:30.696
Dombrowski, send it.

20:34.118 --> 20:37.701
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.

20:55.974 --> 21:00.018
Have this intercept coded
and transmitted to fleet headquarters!

21:29.674 --> 21:33.458
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission

21:33.887 --> 21:37.053
from Kwajalein
to Yamamoto's headquarters:

21:37.682 --> 21:41.300
''A-F has trouble
with its freshwater condenser.''

21:41.728 --> 21:43.222
''A-F'' has to be Midway lsland.

21:46.524 --> 21:51.352
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt.
l'm calling in the whole staff.

21:53.072 --> 21:56.109
This is how
l expect the battle to develop:

21:56.534 --> 22:01.280
The northern force, under Hosogaya,
strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.

22:01.706 --> 22:06.167
To keep Nimitz's attention
away from our main objective.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.456
He will not realize
our objective is Midway

22:09.881 --> 22:13.961
until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island

22:14.385 --> 22:16.758
and destroy the American
planes and shore batteries.

22:17.180 --> 22:21.723
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.

22:22.143 --> 22:26.437
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet,

22:26.856 --> 22:29.063
most certainly his carriers,
to repel the invasion.

22:29.484 --> 22:33.268
His carrier commander
will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey.

22:36.199 --> 22:39.568
l have studied his tactics
and l have studied the man.

22:39.994 --> 22:43.244
Halsey is courageous,
tough-minded and not afraid of risks,

22:43.665 --> 22:46.037
but we will turn
these strengths against him.

22:46.459 --> 22:50.243
lt will take Halsey's task force
at least 48 hours to reach Midway.

22:50.713 --> 22:54.794
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have
crushed Midway and be waiting for him.

22:56.010 --> 22:58.418
You'll have a better position,

22:58.847 --> 23:02.678
and at least
a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers,

23:03.101 --> 23:07.145
and 4 to 5 times
the number of screening vessels.

23:07.564 --> 23:13.400
Assuming the American fleet is still
guarding Hawaii when we strike.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.192
Nimitz is crippled
and on the defensive.

23:16.614 --> 23:20.564
He must deploy his remaining strength
around his most valuable Pacific base.

23:20.994 --> 23:23.033
l agree with Admiral Nagumo.

23:23.454 --> 23:26.325
We must make certain
where the enemy fleet is.

23:26.750 --> 23:33.251
l propose we send 2 flying boats
to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.

23:34.674 --> 23:39.336
We fuel them by tanker submarine and
fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.

23:39.762 --> 23:43.677
They then report whether or not
the American fleet is actually there.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.556
A very wise precaution indeed.

23:46.978 --> 23:51.687
We will call it ''Dperation K''.
Does anyone have any other thoughts?

23:52.108 --> 23:53.567
Yes.

23:55.361 --> 23:57.687
We can achieve a great victory,

23:58.114 --> 24:02.361
providing Nimitz and Halsey
do exactly what you expect.

24:06.414 --> 24:09.581
The Enterprise and the Hornet
are due in by sundown.

24:10.001 --> 24:12.836
The rest of the task force
should be in by morning.

24:13.296 --> 24:16.630
The Yorktown is more
severely damaged than we thought.

24:17.050 --> 24:19.089
How soon can we dry-dock her?

24:19.510 --> 24:24.338
By the 17th, if a Jap sub
doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.

24:24.766 --> 24:28.514
Admiral Fletcher
just radioed in with a repair list.

24:30.772 --> 24:35.434
Tell the yard repairman l want
every workman he can get to board her.

24:36.152 --> 24:39.319
That sharpshooter from Washington
just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.230
Who did they send?
- Captain Vinton Maddox.

24:42.659 --> 24:45.066
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!

24:45.495 --> 24:50.073
See that he's thoroughly briefed,
and get Captain Garth up here.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.536
Admiral,
why don't you let me handle it?

24:53.962 --> 24:57.544
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.

25:01.177 --> 25:05.969
Are those arming switches fixed?
- No, we still got some damn snafu.

25:06.391 --> 25:12.809
Get them working 100% , or rip them
out of all our SBDs. ls that clear?

25:13.231 --> 25:15.900
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.

25:22.156 --> 25:26.071
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early,
but it's our only chance to talk.

25:26.494 --> 25:29.448
lt's DK. Did you get the report?
- Yup.

25:29.873 --> 25:32.198
l've already read it.

25:36.171 --> 25:38.080
Did you know your girl

25:38.506 --> 25:41.875
belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations?

25:44.971 --> 25:48.174
l saw the magazines,
but l didn't know it was propaganda.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.766
The Attorney General's office
says it's subversive.

25:52.187 --> 25:57.312
And the FBl doesn't think she's
telling the truth about coming here.

25:57.734 --> 26:01.150
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure l can! And l can clear it up!

26:02.572 --> 26:05.526
You cool down
and let me handle this!

26:06.868 --> 26:11.411
Tom, l don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not?

26:12.874 --> 26:15.447
l guess l have no alternative,
do l, Sir?

26:16.127 --> 26:17.502
l guess you don't.

26:23.676 --> 26:27.259
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.

26:27.680 --> 26:31.381
Should we get right to it, Captain?
- Certainly, Admiral.

26:31.809 --> 26:35.558
l'm sure you're aware of Washington's
opinion on this Midway invasion.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.353
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.

26:38.775 --> 26:42.475
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.

26:42.904 --> 26:47.613
Could we speak in private?
- lf you'd feel more comfortable.

26:57.085 --> 27:02.126
These enemy radio intercepts
your intelligence has accumulated ...

27:02.549 --> 27:07.625
Very detailed ... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th?

27:08.888 --> 27:12.802
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.

27:13.226 --> 27:18.267
Washington's sure Yamamoto's
feeding you this to hide his plans.

27:18.690 --> 27:21.228
Very definitely possible.

27:21.651 --> 27:25.696
Well, then how can you insist ...
- Because l believe it's factual.

27:26.114 --> 27:28.819
l'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.

27:29.492 --> 27:31.449
But if you're wrong, Admiral,

27:31.869 --> 27:34.954
if you send our carriers
into a Japanese ambush,

27:35.373 --> 27:37.994
the entire West Coast and Hawaii
will be open for invasion.

27:38.418 --> 27:40.541
Fully aware of that, Captain.

27:40.962 --> 27:44.497
You mean, the safe play
is to defend the home folks first?

27:45.759 --> 27:49.423
With respects, Admiral,
it's the smart play.

27:56.102 --> 27:57.976
Captain, if we surprise the enemy,

27:58.396 --> 28:00.768
catch him where he's not expecting us,

28:01.191 --> 28:04.061
we can drive him back 3,000 miles.

28:04.485 --> 28:09.231
And keep him pinned till we can
take him on in his own front yard.

28:09.657 --> 28:12.409
My instructions were
to convey Washington's deep concern

28:12.827 --> 28:16.872
over the safety
of the West Coast and Hawaii.

28:17.290 --> 28:21.667
ls Washington ordering me
to defend Hawaii or the West Coast?

28:22.754 --> 28:23.750
No, Sir.

28:24.172 --> 28:26.295
My orders were simply to consult.

28:26.716 --> 28:30.167
No, Sir,
l have no such orders for you.

28:31.679 --> 28:36.555
Commander Blake, send the fleet to
repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.265
lssue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

28:39.687 --> 28:44.100
Admiral, may l see you a moment?
- Excuse me, Captain.

28:54.035 --> 28:57.819
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.

28:58.248 --> 29:02.459
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital

29:02.877 --> 29:06.495
it must be not only damn serious,
it must be critical.

29:06.923 --> 29:11.549
Admiral, l have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.

29:11.970 --> 29:16.596
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code,
the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.

29:17.016 --> 29:21.974
How long do you need for the new code?
- A month, maybe two.

29:22.397 --> 29:25.647
Sir, do you still
want that fleet order issued?

29:28.027 --> 29:30.234
Yes. Target: Midway.

29:56.014 --> 29:59.015
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.

29:59.434 --> 30:01.473
Thank you, Captain.

30:01.895 --> 30:06.806
Rear Admiral Kusaka,
my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.

30:07.233 --> 30:09.605
Where's Commander Genda?

30:10.028 --> 30:13.860
He's in sick bay, Admiral. lnfluenza.

30:14.282 --> 30:16.275
When does the doctor think
he can resume his duties?

30:16.701 --> 30:18.112
ln 2 or 3 days.

30:19.329 --> 30:23.077
l don't like beginning this operation
without my best air commander.

30:23.500 --> 30:28.921
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.

30:29.464 --> 30:31.207
Fuchida too?

30:33.093 --> 30:34.468
We'll need a replacement.

30:34.886 --> 30:37.721
Genda suggests
a veteran torpedo pilot:

30:38.139 --> 30:40.262
Lieutenant Tomonaga.

30:40.975 --> 30:45.139
lf Genda says so,
l want to see Tomonaga right away.

30:45.772 --> 30:46.970
Yes, Sir.

30:52.362 --> 30:57.273
Fuchida, the man who led
my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.

30:57.700 --> 31:01.365
Genda, who planned it, both ill.

31:02.539 --> 31:06.204
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.

31:06.918 --> 31:10.121
Dnly an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.

31:51.921 --> 31:54.792
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.

32:12.692 --> 32:14.934
Here we are. The Sakura family.

32:15.361 --> 32:19.774
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant.
l can find my own way out.

32:29.292 --> 32:32.827
Miss Sakura,
l'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.

32:33.254 --> 32:35.413
Please come in.

32:37.717 --> 32:42.379
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.

32:42.806 --> 32:44.051
How do you do?

32:44.474 --> 32:48.721
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.

32:49.145 --> 32:52.229
Yes. Well, thank you.

33:00.365 --> 33:03.319
lf l embarrassed you, forgive me,

33:03.743 --> 33:08.820
but l wanted you to see that they
are not a threat to national security.

33:09.249 --> 33:11.870
l never really
thought they would be, Miss Sakura.

33:12.293 --> 33:15.330
l suppose it goes with the times.

33:15.755 --> 33:18.958
And l shouldn't be bitter?

33:19.384 --> 33:21.341
l never said that.

33:21.761 --> 33:23.469
Damn it, l'm an American!

33:24.222 --> 33:28.551
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans?

33:29.602 --> 33:31.061
Pearl Harbor, l guess.

33:35.692 --> 33:38.776
Look, l've read the FBl report.

33:39.195 --> 33:41.686
Ask me anything you want to.

33:42.115 --> 33:43.526
Alright.

33:44.075 --> 33:48.951
Your father has been seen frequently
entering the Japanese consulate.

33:49.372 --> 33:52.159
He has old friends there.

33:52.584 --> 33:53.828
l see.

33:55.295 --> 33:59.375
What about these
patriotic organizations you belong to?

33:59.799 --> 34:02.586
My father enrolled me in those
when l was born.

34:03.011 --> 34:07.139
Dut of respect for him
l never resigned, but l wasn't active.

34:07.557 --> 34:09.348
l see.

34:09.766 --> 34:15.010
What about those magazines
they found in your parents' apartment?

34:15.440 --> 34:18.856
The ''Prairie Shimbun''?
Published in Wyoming.

34:19.277 --> 34:22.860
My father has
deep emotional ties for Japan,

34:23.281 --> 34:27.445
but even so he thought
it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.

34:27.869 --> 34:30.407
Why did he subscribe?

34:31.456 --> 34:33.947
He's a traditional and honorable man.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.625
He was once indebted to the man
who publishes the ''Prairie Shimbun''.

34:40.882 --> 34:44.333
Look, Miss Sakura,
l understand you came to Hawaii

34:44.761 --> 34:48.094
to ask your parents' permission
to marry my son.

34:49.224 --> 34:50.089
Yes, l did.

34:50.516 --> 34:54.181
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl?
- l didn't want to implicate Tom.

34:54.978 --> 34:57.897
Why won't you see him?
He's in love with you, he tells me.

34:58.316 --> 35:01.815
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. l don't either.

35:03.405 --> 35:07.070
Because my parents have
forbidden me to marry outside my race.

35:13.748 --> 35:15.824
l want you to tell him for me.

35:18.586 --> 35:20.911
l can't tell him that.

35:21.548 --> 35:23.754
He wouldn't believe me.

35:24.175 --> 35:27.046
Besides, l'd just as soon
he didn't know we'd talked together.

35:28.304 --> 35:29.763
Look, Miss Sakura,

35:30.807 --> 35:32.182
Haruko,

35:32.642 --> 35:36.058
Tom's based
at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.

35:37.105 --> 35:40.225
Send for him, please.

35:40.650 --> 35:45.277
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.

36:23.943 --> 36:26.399
Damn itching is driving me crazy!

36:26.821 --> 36:30.570
All those medics can do is
smear this God-awful paste on it.

36:30.992 --> 36:35.405
When they get the nerve to come near.
- l know l'm a bad patient.

36:35.830 --> 36:40.575
But a skin disease! Df all the stupid,
useless things to get laid up with!

36:41.002 --> 36:45.379
lt's driving me nuts. l can't even
think! - We don't have much time.

36:45.798 --> 36:50.259
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now,
and l've got hard decisions to make.

36:50.678 --> 36:54.012
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance.

36:56.768 --> 37:00.184
l know he's junior
to a lot of other flag officers,

37:00.605 --> 37:04.934
and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.

37:09.656 --> 37:12.229
Well, you asked for my recommendation.

37:14.869 --> 37:17.076
l can just picture
Washington's reaction

37:17.497 --> 37:21.162
if l hand over the Hornet and
the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.

37:21.584 --> 37:26.211
Especially with the static l'm getting
for expecting the Japanese at Midway.

37:27.549 --> 37:32.756
You told me once, Chet:
''When you're in command, command.''

37:34.180 --> 37:37.549
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

37:38.268 --> 37:42.431
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations
on bringing your cripple in.

37:42.855 --> 37:47.103
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got
much time, so l'll make this fast.

37:47.527 --> 37:52.817
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while.

37:53.241 --> 37:58.828
l'm sending you out again, Jack,
in 72 hours. ln full combat readiness.

37:59.247 --> 38:03.992
That's impossible! lt'll be 3 months
before the Yorktown's in commission.

38:04.419 --> 38:08.748
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.

38:09.173 --> 38:10.716
You follow him 48 hours later.

38:11.718 --> 38:15.087
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.

38:15.513 --> 38:18.004
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.

38:19.559 --> 38:22.975
And he sure as hell
can't learn it by tomorrow, can he?

38:24.022 --> 38:25.101
No.

38:27.191 --> 38:31.984
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, l'm still in a state of shock.

38:32.530 --> 38:35.484
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand? - Coming fine, Sir.

38:35.909 --> 38:37.985
We could have used you at Coral Sea.

38:38.411 --> 38:41.745
He's on your Air Dperations staff
on the Yorktown.

38:42.165 --> 38:43.279
Good.

38:45.209 --> 38:51.082
We face the biggest force the enemy
has ever sortied, over 200 ships.

38:51.508 --> 38:53.381
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.

38:53.802 --> 38:56.553
Yamamoto himself is commanding.

38:57.138 --> 39:01.302
We know when
and from where he's going to sail,

39:01.726 --> 39:03.469
we know their original courses.

39:03.895 --> 39:09.518
We don't know their rendezvous point,
course changes or when they'll strike.

39:09.943 --> 39:15.779
They could hit from the northwest,
but intelligence doesn't support that.

39:16.199 --> 39:20.066
Ray, assuming
this isn't just an elaborate ruse,

39:21.037 --> 39:23.908
Washington thinks it is,
but assuming they're wrong,

39:24.332 --> 39:27.452
what kind of move do you suggest?

39:31.965 --> 39:36.841
Well, l'd take my carriers here,
to a point northeast of Midway,

39:37.261 --> 39:39.669
and wait for Nagumo's carriers.

39:40.098 --> 39:43.218
Why not head northwest
and hit them head-on?

39:43.643 --> 39:46.134
There's a chance
Washington may be right.

39:47.021 --> 39:49.691
You think Hawaii and the West Coast
could be the real target?

39:50.108 --> 39:55.778
lt doesn't really matter, provided
l'm in a position to cut them off.

39:56.823 --> 39:59.396
lf it's Midway, l'll bushwhack them.

39:59.826 --> 40:04.986
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take
command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.

40:05.415 --> 40:09.828
The Yorktown will be at sea
in less than 72 hours.

40:10.253 --> 40:15.211
l don't need to stress that Yamamoto
outweighs us in every department.

40:15.633 --> 40:20.876
Dur 3 carriers are all that stands
between the enemy fleet and our coast.

40:21.639 --> 40:25.055
Now, your point of rendezvous,
what should we call it?

40:26.060 --> 40:28.053
''Point Luck'', Sir.

40:30.773 --> 40:34.688
Sounds like a prayer,
but it's damned appropriate.

40:35.153 --> 40:36.351
Son of a bitch!

40:36.988 --> 40:38.233
Nurse!

40:39.115 --> 40:41.322
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.

40:42.243 --> 40:44.734
Wanted to call the nurse
to have that tree cut down.

40:45.163 --> 40:47.832
lt spoils my view of the boatyard.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.043
Feeling DK?

40:51.461 --> 40:56.538
l can't sleep. l can't eat.
l just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.

40:56.966 --> 41:00.252
You ever try an oatmeal
and water bath? Don't.

41:01.304 --> 41:05.349
l want to thank you for recommending
me to take your place.

41:05.809 --> 41:07.089
l have a question:

41:07.727 --> 41:09.767
Did that itch go to your head?

41:11.523 --> 41:14.013
Stop underestimating yourself.

41:14.442 --> 41:17.692
Any skipper who can keep
his cruisers and destroyers

41:18.112 --> 41:22.489
alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.

41:22.909 --> 41:25.364
You know, you and l ...

41:27.956 --> 41:30.114
Bill, we're kind of different.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.706
You think l can do it as well as you?

41:35.255 --> 41:37.212
l can only tell you this, Ray:

41:37.632 --> 41:41.131
You play it the way you feel it,
not the way you think l'd play it.

41:41.553 --> 41:46.013
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and
chew his ass. Nothing more to it.

41:48.726 --> 41:52.060
Christ, no! You want to catch this?
We'd lose the God-damned war!

41:59.237 --> 42:00.612
Dh, by the way,

42:01.906 --> 42:05.904
l'll have somebody cut down
that tree for you. - Yeah.

42:28.349 --> 42:32.133
ln carrying out the task
assigned in Dp-Plan 29/ 42,

42:32.979 --> 42:36.728
Enterprise and Hornet will act
on the principle of calculated risk,

42:37.525 --> 42:43.361
which means avoiding exposure
to attack by superior enemy forces

42:43.781 --> 42:49.654
without good prospect of inflicting
greater damage to the enemy.

43:22.946 --> 43:25.069
Sir, three boilers
are out of commission.

43:25.490 --> 43:28.859
The yard manager says
he needs another two days.

43:29.285 --> 43:34.872
Delaney, l expect the yard
to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.

43:36.084 --> 43:37.993
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.

43:38.419 --> 43:40.875
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00

43:41.297 --> 43:44.382
you'll rendezvous with Enterprise
and Hornet on schedule.

43:44.801 --> 43:48.252
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.

43:49.138 --> 43:52.424
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.

43:57.438 --> 44:00.938
We just haven't any future, Tom.

44:01.359 --> 44:04.775
l figured that's what it was.

44:05.196 --> 44:07.236
We don't.

44:07.657 --> 44:09.365
We really don't.

44:09.784 --> 44:11.113
l wish you'd go now.

44:12.996 --> 44:17.124
l don't love you anymore.
lt was a mistake.

44:21.337 --> 44:23.045
Say it to my face.

44:28.553 --> 44:31.304
say it to my face, God damn it!

44:46.154 --> 44:48.193
lt'll be DK.

44:51.409 --> 44:52.689
Shit. Wait and see!

44:53.119 --> 44:56.488
1919, the Marines were practicing
dive-bombing off Haiti.

44:56.915 --> 44:59.453
Everybody said:
''Premature, wait and see.''

44:59.876 --> 45:03.292
We waited, then the Germans
showed us in '37 in Madrid.

45:03.713 --> 45:06.382
You mean like at Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor, shit!

45:06.799 --> 45:12.339
ln '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor
could be attacked from the air.

45:12.764 --> 45:16.927
And Admiral Ramsey predicted
it would happen, in detail.

45:17.352 --> 45:20.269
When was that?
- 1937, pal.

45:21.231 --> 45:23.022
Wait and see. We waited.

45:23.650 --> 45:26.604
December 7th, we saw.

45:27.028 --> 45:31.192
The wait-and-seers
will bust your ass every time.

45:31.616 --> 45:34.451
l'll drink to that.
- Bet your ...

45:36.246 --> 45:40.374
How long have you been here?
- Long enough to hear your lecture.

45:40.792 --> 45:43.543
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you?

45:43.962 --> 45:46.998
Alright ... Well, l'm celebrating
my birthday. That's how l am.

45:47.423 --> 45:49.546
That's a problem
we all have once a year.

45:50.385 --> 45:53.836
My God,
now you got my kid flying for you.

45:54.264 --> 45:56.506
How's the boy doing?
- Just fine.

45:56.933 --> 46:02.224
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.

46:03.398 --> 46:05.639
Coming from you that means a lot.

46:06.067 --> 46:11.654
No. He's good man, a natural pilot,
good attitude, good marksman.

46:12.073 --> 46:18.491
Tom's only deficiency
would be in enemy identification.

46:20.999 --> 46:24.165
He's got to learn, you don't win a war
by kissing the enemy.

46:24.586 --> 46:28.334
For Christ's sake ... - Well, he told
the whole God-damned squadron.

46:28.757 --> 46:32.421
l met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.

46:32.844 --> 46:36.888
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing.

46:38.433 --> 46:39.595
l've got to shove off.

46:41.895 --> 46:46.604
Scuttlebutt says you're going out
on the Yorktown. - That's right.

46:47.025 --> 46:51.936
Well, keep your dumb ass
out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.

46:52.572 --> 46:55.857
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy.
l appreciate it.

46:57.368 --> 46:58.779
He'll be fine, Matt.

47:10.173 --> 47:13.339
Tom! - Nice of you
to take the time to see me off, Dad.

47:13.760 --> 47:17.176
But your squadron isn't due to ship
for a week. Why are you boarding?

47:17.597 --> 47:22.342
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir?
Your buddy Jessop transferred me.

47:22.769 --> 47:24.726
l didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!

47:25.188 --> 47:30.016
You wanted me shipped out,
to stop me from doing anything stupid!

47:30.443 --> 47:34.772
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, l knew nothing about it!

47:35.198 --> 47:37.487
l have to report on board, Sir.

47:48.753 --> 47:51.161
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

47:58.513 --> 47:59.793
DK, Sir.

48:06.354 --> 48:11.395
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you?

48:12.735 --> 48:17.481
l'm gonna do something l don't do,
at least not since Annapolis.

48:17.907 --> 48:24.028
l'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows l owe you some.

48:24.456 --> 48:30.494
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this?

48:31.087 --> 48:32.166
Don't ask.

48:32.589 --> 48:35.792
Matt, l could find out.
- Don't, Harry.

48:40.513 --> 48:45.389
The report contains all the bureau
has on ... - A Japanese?

48:46.019 --> 48:50.764
Dn an American citizen
named Haruko Sakura und her parents.

48:52.317 --> 48:56.017
They look DK to me,
but l'm not in your business.

48:56.446 --> 48:58.403
lt sounds like you are.

49:00.450 --> 49:04.282
Harry, l want you
to investigate this personally.

49:05.330 --> 49:07.618
They'll be sent
to the mainland next week.

49:08.333 --> 49:11.250
lf they're clean,
and l'm betting they are,

49:11.669 --> 49:13.579
l want that shipment cancelled.

49:14.005 --> 49:18.667
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!

49:19.093 --> 49:21.501
This is tampering!

49:26.142 --> 49:28.218
Alright, what have we got?

49:28.645 --> 49:31.314
What are these people to you?

49:32.815 --> 49:36.944
Someday,
the girl may be my daughter-in-law.

49:38.655 --> 49:44.775
You're pressuring me to take
improper action for personal reasons.

49:45.203 --> 49:47.575
lmproper action, hell!

49:47.997 --> 49:51.082
They're no more
a threat to national security

49:51.501 --> 49:53.790
than your pet Airedale.

49:56.297 --> 50:00.959
l'll have to report your request.
lt'll go into your record.

50:01.386 --> 50:02.714
lt's not for me.

50:03.888 --> 50:08.965
You know l wouldn't ask you
for myself. l'm asking you for my kid.

50:09.394 --> 50:11.470
Jesus Christ, Harry!

50:12.397 --> 50:14.306
l'm begging you!

50:23.783 --> 50:26.654
Alright, l'll investigate it.

50:30.290 --> 50:31.749
Thanks, Harry.

50:36.379 --> 50:38.170
And, Captain,

50:40.884 --> 50:43.090
this'll wash it with us.

50:46.014 --> 50:49.133
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

51:01.905 --> 51:03.150
Captain?

51:05.199 --> 51:07.073
Thank you, Corporal.

51:08.661 --> 51:10.453
Reporting as ordered, Sir.

51:10.872 --> 51:15.368
Sorry to send the Marines after you,
but you didn't answer my messages.

51:15.793 --> 51:18.082
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.

51:18.504 --> 51:22.039
You can cut out that midshipman-crap,
you're talking to your old man.

51:22.884 --> 51:24.378
l'll try to remember it.

51:25.553 --> 51:30.760
l'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl,

51:31.184 --> 51:35.513
l personally vouched
for Haruko and her parents,

51:35.938 --> 51:38.097
and went way out on a limb for them.

51:38.524 --> 51:41.312
l didn't know
what weight it would carry,

51:41.736 --> 51:44.061
but you know, there it is.

51:44.489 --> 51:45.734
Thanks.

51:47.658 --> 51:49.735
Dne more thing:

51:51.579 --> 51:53.868
l didn't ask your C.D.
to ship you out.

51:54.290 --> 51:57.125
You spoke to him, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.

51:57.877 --> 52:01.246
He asked me how l felt about ...
- Haruko and me, right?

52:01.673 --> 52:06.050
lf you couldn't do anything about it,
why couldn't you leave it alone?

52:06.636 --> 52:09.507
Jessop thought
he was doing us both a favor.

52:09.931 --> 52:13.181
l did all l could,
and a lot more than l should've.

52:13.685 --> 52:15.724
You're paid to fly fighter planes,

52:16.145 --> 52:19.395
not to sit in your cabin
and cry over your girl's picture.

52:19.816 --> 52:24.277
You better shape up, Tiger, before
a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!

52:39.460 --> 52:42.034
Just received this message, Sir.

52:42.463 --> 52:46.212
Dperation K, the reconnaissance flight
to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.

52:46.634 --> 52:49.007
Cancelled? Why?

52:49.429 --> 52:52.845
Dur scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.

52:55.768 --> 52:59.849
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force
should be warned immediately.

53:00.273 --> 53:04.223
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up
the transmission when we did.

53:04.652 --> 53:05.815
Suppose he didn't.

53:06.321 --> 53:09.487
He will assume the American carriers
are at Pearl Harbor.

53:09.907 --> 53:13.277
And that is where our latest
intelligence reports place them.

53:13.703 --> 53:16.324
What latest intelligence reports?

53:16.748 --> 53:21.410
Have any of our submarines sighted
the US fleet in the last 20 hours?

53:21.836 --> 53:28.420
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason
for them to move their carriers.

53:28.843 --> 53:33.671
We must not break radio silence and
risk letting them know our location.

53:34.098 --> 53:40.433
The element of surprise is one of the
most important aspects of our attack.

53:57.706 --> 53:59.449
Admiral, this is our search plan.

54:00.166 --> 54:03.582
An air search involving 22 PBYs,

54:04.003 --> 54:07.704
each plane flying 700 miles out,
covering an 8-degree sector.

54:08.133 --> 54:10.968
We'll have a 180-degree view
at anything coming from the west,

54:11.386 --> 54:14.802
and still have a flanking area
northeast of Midway for our carriers.

54:15.223 --> 54:18.509
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

55:32.717 --> 55:36.168
Jesus, how many of those can you eat?

56:06.417 --> 56:09.621
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.

56:12.840 --> 56:15.083
No sightings.

56:16.386 --> 56:20.253
ls there any defense measure
we've overlooked?

56:20.682 --> 56:22.758
That had top priority, Admiral.

56:23.184 --> 56:28.724
You sent everything we had:
tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns.

56:29.149 --> 56:34.190
lt's miserable waiting for an attack
on your own people, hoping it happens.

56:34.612 --> 56:37.613
More pressure from Washington?
- Not a whisper.

56:38.032 --> 56:41.900
Frankly,
l'd rather have them raising hell.

57:01.639 --> 57:03.015
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid?

57:03.433 --> 57:06.054
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.

57:06.853 --> 57:10.897
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs
we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.

57:11.524 --> 57:12.900
DK, Reid.

57:29.917 --> 57:32.753
ln less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians,

57:33.171 --> 57:37.334
and we will still be groping to Midway
in this filthy squall.

57:37.759 --> 57:41.708
We're not due to launch
our first air strike for 36 hours.

57:42.138 --> 57:44.973
Dur predictions are for clear weather
before then, Admiral.

57:45.850 --> 57:49.800
l keep wondering what Dperation K
uncovered at Pearl Harbor.

57:50.230 --> 57:52.388
Were the American carriers there?

57:52.857 --> 57:58.895
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.

58:01.324 --> 58:04.111
Damn communications blackout!

58:14.504 --> 58:18.039
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!

58:18.466 --> 58:19.581
Here we go.

58:31.270 --> 58:35.648
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.

58:41.698 --> 58:44.485
The Aleutian lslands
are being invaded, Admiral.

58:51.249 --> 58:54.618
Washington could still be right.

58:55.044 --> 58:59.920
lt could be a feint for an attack
on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.

59:00.341 --> 59:02.085
Dr what we've defended against.

59:02.510 --> 59:06.840
Today. Dur PBY should tell us today.

59:30.121 --> 59:32.529
Hey, do you see what l see?

59:34.751 --> 59:36.293
Damn right, l do!

59:37.920 --> 59:43.342
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.

59:43.760 --> 59:47.129
That's all? Just ''Main body''?
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.

59:51.351 --> 59:54.850
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!

59:55.688 --> 01:00:00.730
Radio's picked up it's transmission.
lt's alerting Midway.

01:00:01.152 --> 01:00:02.646
Break radio silence.

01:00:03.071 --> 01:00:07.614
Advise Admiral Yamamoto:
lnvasion force has been discovered.

01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:15.571
6 large ships in a column, bearing
262 degrees, distance 700 miles.

01:00:18.545 --> 01:00:23.503
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.

01:00:23.925 --> 01:00:25.834
Enigma!

01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:30.931
You know what l mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.

01:00:33.852 --> 01:00:36.638
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.

01:00:37.063 --> 01:00:41.191
11 ships, course 090, speed 19 knots.

01:00:41.609 --> 01:00:43.768
Just what kind of ships?

01:00:44.195 --> 01:00:48.572
First transmission said ''Main body'',
but didn't mention carriers.

01:00:48.992 --> 01:00:55.279
That PBY, Strawberry-9,
was at the end of his 700-mile leg.

01:00:55.957 --> 01:00:59.041
Nagumo's carriers could be
following the large ships.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.370
Maybe beyond his horizon.

01:01:01.796 --> 01:01:05.379
lf they are, Fletcher's too far north.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.379
He has to move at top speed now to get
within striking distance by sunset.

01:01:10.805 --> 01:01:14.139
But if Nagumo's carriers are
coming in behind the storm front ...

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.884
Fletcher'd be caught
between two forces.

01:01:17.312 --> 01:01:20.811
Yes, if we let him head
for that main body sighting.

01:01:24.986 --> 01:01:29.981
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NDT main body.

01:01:30.408 --> 01:01:33.362
Expect enemy carrier strike
tomorrow behind storm front ...

01:01:33.786 --> 01:01:38.247
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.

01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:45.002
CinCPAC must think the PBY
sighted only Kondo's invasion force.

01:01:45.423 --> 01:01:48.792
But if it's Nagumo's attack force
with its carriers,

01:01:49.218 --> 01:01:52.588
and its scouts find us
before we find them ...

01:01:57.936 --> 01:01:59.727
Sound general quarters!

01:02:13.284 --> 01:02:17.946
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.

01:02:18.373 --> 01:02:22.999
We intercepted a radio transmission
from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto.

01:02:23.419 --> 01:02:29.671
lntelligence does not report
any movement of the American fleet.

01:02:30.093 --> 01:02:33.544
Whatever doubts we may have had ...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.

01:02:33.972 --> 01:02:38.135
We have no definitive intelligence
reports, only opinions and estimates.

01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:41.726
And Yamamoto's silence
does not make them a fact.

01:02:42.146 --> 01:02:45.432
Admiral.
- Genda.

01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:54.235
My apologies. l've been
away from my duties much too long.

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:57.533
Genda, how are you?

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:03.079
l'm well enough
to take charge of air operations.

01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:07.000
And so you shall, my friend.

01:03:08.047 --> 01:03:12.425
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area?

01:03:12.844 --> 01:03:17.802
Where l would deploy my carriers
if l were an American commander.

01:03:18.224 --> 01:03:22.720
There, northeast of Midway.

01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:33.478
Times like this,
Joe, l miss the flatlands.

01:03:34.532 --> 01:03:40.286
lt's a big body of water out there.
l'm a fella from the Texas prairie.

01:03:40.705 --> 01:03:44.039
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.

01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:47.413
You could wade across it
at the height of the rainy season.

01:03:47.837 --> 01:03:50.506
During summer
we made clay pots out of its bottom.

01:03:56.095 --> 01:04:00.307
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure
as hell earned your pay this month.

01:04:02.435 --> 01:04:04.558
Well, thank you, Sir.

01:04:05.271 --> 01:04:10.479
To cover the area, we will launch
scout planes from Akagi and Kaga,

01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:14.069
and our cruiser escorts
will launch 5 seaplanes.

01:04:15.114 --> 01:04:18.614
Very good. And until our scouts
have searched the area,

01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:22.867
we'll hold our most experienced pilots
and half our aircraft in reserve.

01:04:23.289 --> 01:04:24.665
But the American fleet

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:29.543
can't be anywhere near Midway. We
shouldn't hold back our best pilots.

01:04:30.004 --> 01:04:32.330
We've been over this before.

01:04:32.841 --> 01:04:36.541
Admiral,
our first strike must be decisive.

01:04:36.969 --> 01:04:42.391
lf we don't destroy Midway's airstrip
and planes, we invite a counterstrike.

01:04:44.102 --> 01:04:45.596
Commander Genda?

01:04:48.982 --> 01:04:50.808
l agree with you, Sir.

01:04:51.275 --> 01:04:53.601
Let our younger pilots
fly the first strike.

01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:59.236
l am sure they can do the job.
lf not, we can launch a second strike.

01:04:59.659 --> 01:05:01.817
That is how it will be.

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:10.251
Suddenly, the man who led us
to victory at Pearl Harbor

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:12.828
is choked by caution.

01:05:13.256 --> 01:05:15.747
He senses danger out there.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.551
So do l.

01:05:19.971 --> 01:05:24.384
Their transports wouldn't be so close
if they didn't plan to invade soon.

01:05:24.809 --> 01:05:27.135
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:30.563
Yes, but from where?
He could pop out anywhere.

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:36.018
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first.

01:05:36.446 --> 01:05:38.106
lf he hits our blind side ...

01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:44.901
Why don't we get some eyes out there?
10 SBDs will cover our northern flank.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:47.369
DK. But no more than 100 miles out.

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:52.618
l want to recover them fast,
in case the PBYs make contact first.

01:06:19.197 --> 01:06:22.233
You DK?
- Yeah. - Here.

01:06:24.327 --> 01:06:29.369
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:32.875
He gets his dope straight
from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?

01:06:33.294 --> 01:06:37.292
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.

01:06:37.715 --> 01:06:39.755
You're crazy!

01:06:41.094 --> 01:06:45.341
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed
to be sacked out. What're you doing?

01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:48.349
We couldn't sleep.

01:06:49.519 --> 01:06:54.644
l know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:58.355
Yes, Sir.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.218
Excellent weather forecast.

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:33.557
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet
to conceal us from enemy scout planes,

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.975
and above unlimited visibility
straight into Midway for our flyers.

01:07:40.737 --> 01:07:43.489
Commence launching.

01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:26.443
All our cruisers' scout planes
are in the air, except one.

01:08:26.866 --> 01:08:29.488
The Tone is having catapult problems.

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:33.488
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long?

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.328
Half an hour, Sir.

01:08:36.751 --> 01:08:39.158
ln case the Americans suddenly appear,

01:08:39.587 --> 01:08:43.834
l suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave
on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.

01:08:44.384 --> 01:08:48.796
Armed with torpedoes
to deal with enemy carriers? - Yes.

01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:50.845
Dur planes and the Kaga's.

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:55.761
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by
with bombs for Midway.

01:08:58.606 --> 01:09:01.014
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:34.807
Now it's up to our strike leader.

01:09:35.727 --> 01:09:38.810
Tomonaga is the best we've got.

01:10:09.802 --> 01:10:11.000
Howie?

01:10:20.897 --> 01:10:23.139
lt's the whole damn Jap navy!

01:10:25.068 --> 01:10:29.813
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.

01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:38.028
We got 'em! lt's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.

01:10:50.635 --> 01:10:53.126
''Enemy carriers''? That's all?

01:10:53.555 --> 01:10:58.216
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since.

01:10:58.852 --> 01:11:04.272
lf he was on course and on schedule,
he made the contact about here,

01:11:04.691 --> 01:11:07.063
250 miles out.

01:11:07.485 --> 01:11:10.154
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:25.960
You certain it was Strawberry-5?

01:11:27.171 --> 01:11:28.963
Positive, Skipper.

01:11:29.924 --> 01:11:32.296
How far are we
from that contact point?

01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:34.343
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.

01:11:34.763 --> 01:11:38.807
Bandits! Sweet mother of God,
hundreds! - Where, damn it?

01:11:40.143 --> 01:11:42.681
Four ... no, five o'clock!

01:11:44.897 --> 01:11:46.558
Jesus!

01:11:51.404 --> 01:11:55.188
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:57.492
Are you certain?

01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:01.077
Alright, just let us know
the second you get anything else.

01:12:01.497 --> 01:12:05.163
Nothing more. No word from our scouts
since that ''Many planes'' flash.

01:12:05.585 --> 01:12:10.128
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5?
- No call letters were sent.

01:12:11.383 --> 01:12:13.708
Maybe he was jumped
by enemy fighters.

01:12:14.135 --> 01:12:18.881
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?

01:12:20.016 --> 01:12:22.305
Those Japs
will never find us in this soup.

01:12:22.727 --> 01:12:28.682
And we'll never find their carriers
unless we break into the clear.

01:12:29.109 --> 01:12:32.358
Damn it!
l should've risked going straight in.

01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:44.069
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:50.542
Lieutenant, they're behind us!
l see 2 carriers and a battleship.

01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:53.538
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

01:13:03.893 --> 01:13:07.891
''Fletcher to Spruance. Second
sighting reported, Strawberry-5:

01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:12.692
2 enemy carriers, battleship.
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.

01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:17.523
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.

01:13:17.949 --> 01:13:20.357
Speed: 25 knots.''

01:13:20.785 --> 01:13:22.944
Came right out of the slot
where Nimitz figured.

01:13:23.454 --> 01:13:26.989
''Proceed southwesterly,
attack enemy carriers.

01:13:27.417 --> 01:13:30.536
Will follow as soon as
search planes recovered. Fletcher.''

01:13:30.962 --> 01:13:33.963
Signal ''Ahoy'', Captain Browning.

01:13:34.924 --> 01:13:36.833
To battle stations.

01:14:10.126 --> 01:14:13.827
Get the control tower.

01:14:16.966 --> 01:14:19.374
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up?

01:14:19.802 --> 01:14:23.171
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.

01:14:23.598 --> 01:14:25.507
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.

01:14:25.933 --> 01:14:29.350
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:35.519
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock.

01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:41.524
l see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.867
Let's see how many
we can drop on the first pass.

01:14:53.878 --> 01:14:55.705
Two bogies under you!

01:15:00.134 --> 01:15:04.428
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!

01:15:08.685 --> 01:15:10.594
Get him off me!

01:15:14.524 --> 01:15:18.059
Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you!

01:15:19.612 --> 01:15:24.404
l'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!

01:15:25.744 --> 01:15:28.199
Look out, Rainbow! Dn your tail!

01:15:28.621 --> 01:15:31.112
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!

01:15:41.676 --> 01:15:44.001
Look at that Jap bastard!

01:15:45.138 --> 01:15:50.808
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!

01:15:51.436 --> 01:15:54.354
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.

01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:58.473
Report please!
What is your condition? Report!

01:15:59.819 --> 01:16:00.815
Good God!

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:03.479
Give me the tower.

01:16:06.534 --> 01:16:08.776
Andy, they blew
right through Parks' fighters!

01:16:09.203 --> 01:16:11.611
Get your people under shelter!

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:28.962
Jesus!

01:16:29.975 --> 01:16:31.089
Come on!

01:16:38.357 --> 01:16:40.480
Attack in squadron order!

01:18:04.652 --> 01:18:07.487
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.

01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:10.527
Dur landing strip's still operational.

01:18:41.272 --> 01:18:44.107
Tomonaga
is asking for a second strike.

01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:49.609
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.

01:18:50.031 --> 01:18:54.076
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft,
in the air and on the ground.

01:18:54.494 --> 01:18:59.072
But the pilots you chose
did not destroy the airstrip.

01:18:59.707 --> 01:19:04.286
We have 93 planes and our best pilots
waiting on our flight decks.

01:19:04.712 --> 01:19:06.954
The entire force should be sent now.

01:19:07.382 --> 01:19:12.969
The entire force? Dur planes are armed
with torpedoes on Genda's advice.

01:19:13.388 --> 01:19:16.424
Hardly suitable for bombing
an airstrip. Correct, Commander?

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.350
They should be immediately
rearmed with bombs below deck.

01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:25.598
We must make certain
that Midway can mount no air attacks.

01:19:26.192 --> 01:19:29.811
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request
is also a warning.

01:19:30.238 --> 01:19:32.360
Midway is still a threat to us.

01:19:32.782 --> 01:19:35.024
So are the American carriers.

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.409
lf they are nearby, yes.

01:19:37.829 --> 01:19:40.699
But after 2 hours,
our scouts have reported nothing.

01:19:41.124 --> 01:19:44.908
You're forgetting, scout number 4
was a half-hour late taking off.

01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:49.037
lt will not reach it's maximum
search range for another hour.

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.923
Tomonaga's planes
will be returning soon.

01:20:02.353 --> 01:20:06.731
They can be quickly refueled
and rearmed for sea action.

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:11.479
ln case our scouts
sight any enemy ships.

01:20:11.905 --> 01:20:13.447
Admiral?

01:20:17.243 --> 01:20:18.702
Very well.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.872
Drder our torpedo bombers
to be rearmed with contact bombs.

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:27.285
As soon as they are ready,
we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.

01:21:00.745 --> 01:21:02.619
57 planes on the line, Sir.

01:21:03.039 --> 01:21:06.325
The Hornet will probably
launch about the same number.

01:21:07.418 --> 01:21:12.625
What's the enemy carriers' position?
- 135 miles, Sir.

01:21:13.049 --> 01:21:16.215
lf we launch immediately,
do our pilots have enough fuel?

01:21:16.636 --> 01:21:19.092
Yes, Sir. lf the weather holds,

01:21:19.514 --> 01:21:22.930
they navigate perfectly and
aren't over the target too long.

01:21:23.351 --> 01:21:28.808
lf we launch now, we might
catch Nagumo like a sitting duck.

01:21:29.232 --> 01:21:34.475
lf we wait, it will give him time
to refuel and reload.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.907
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers.

01:21:38.324 --> 01:21:41.278
l know.
- lntelligence says he has 4.

01:21:41.703 --> 01:21:45.783
lf those other 2 suddenly pop up ...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.

01:21:49.752 --> 01:21:54.415
But we have 2 certain targets
135 miles away that don't expect it.

01:21:57.635 --> 01:22:02.262
Let's get Enterprise
and Hornet turned into the wind.

01:22:07.479 --> 01:22:08.889
lt's from Admiral Spruance.

01:22:09.314 --> 01:22:14.390
Enterprise and Hornet are launching
every aircraft they've got.

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:27.367
Air controller reports our strike
force will be over the deck in 1 hour.

01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:31.658
Just the time we need to finish
arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.

01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:35.290
Your confidence
is most reassuring, Kusaka.

01:22:35.882 --> 01:22:41.172
Dur scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.

01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:46.099
All except scout number 4.

01:23:05.954 --> 01:23:07.448
10 enemy ships sighted.

01:23:07.872 --> 01:23:14.954
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

01:23:15.547 --> 01:23:19.046
Which scout radioed the contact?
- Number 4, Sir.

01:23:22.303 --> 01:23:25.090
How far along are we on rearming?
- Almost half, Sir.

01:23:25.515 --> 01:23:27.223
Drder it halted.

01:23:27.642 --> 01:23:32.351
Radio scout 4 to ascertain
ship types and maintain contact.

01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:44.903
Friendlies, Sir.
Dur search planes returning.

01:23:45.326 --> 01:23:48.695
They'll be on board
in under 15 minutes.

01:23:49.122 --> 01:23:51.363
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:57.248
Dur planes from Enterprise and Hornet
should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.

01:23:57.672 --> 01:24:00.756
They're not on the same course?

01:24:01.175 --> 01:24:03.749
We're counting on it, Admiral.

01:24:04.178 --> 01:24:09.553
Nagumo has to hold course
until he recovers his planes.

01:24:09.976 --> 01:24:14.437
240 degrees puts our people on him
with unfueled aircraft on his decks.

01:24:29.662 --> 01:24:33.494
l don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:35.458
And where's Bombing 8?

01:24:36.252 --> 01:24:38.660
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.

01:24:39.589 --> 01:24:42.376
Ain't they supposed to be with us?

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.430
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.

01:24:48.306 --> 01:24:50.762
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!

01:24:51.184 --> 01:24:54.185
Either my compass is fouled up,
or we're not heading 240.

01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:00.393
There's nothing out there.
l know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.

01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:04.188
Will you tell us, Sir?

01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:10.238
l figure they moved east
since we launched, away from Midway.

01:25:13.164 --> 01:25:17.114
Roger. - What good's our orders,
if the skipper's gonna lead us off?

01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:18.825
l don't like it.

01:25:19.671 --> 01:25:21.295
Take it easy.

01:25:21.714 --> 01:25:26.709
lf anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!

01:25:33.935 --> 01:25:37.351
Sir, another message from scout 4.

01:25:39.399 --> 01:25:44.357
3 additional enemy ships sighted, 250
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

01:25:44.779 --> 01:25:49.275
Apparently 2 cruisers,
a carrier believed to be the Yorktown.

01:25:49.701 --> 01:25:53.532
lmpossible. The Yorktown was
virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.

01:25:53.955 --> 01:25:57.538
They can't have repaired her
and brought her here in 10 days.

01:25:57.959 --> 01:26:00.248
We must assume they have!

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.161
lf it is it,
we must destroy her at once.

01:26:03.965 --> 01:26:06.041
l see.

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.793
Suddenly, the threat
from Midway's bombers seems

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:14.594
less to you than when you urged me
to rearm our planes with bombs!

01:26:15.018 --> 01:26:17.805
Admiral, Midway must wait.

01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:21.230
We should rearm our bombers
and attack that carrier.

01:26:21.899 --> 01:26:24.307
Back to torpedoes again?

01:26:24.736 --> 01:26:30.074
More wasted time! - Tomonaga,
this is Genda. Do you read me?

01:26:33.495 --> 01:26:36.247
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.

01:26:36.665 --> 01:26:40.164
Do you read me?
- l read you, Sir. - Report please.

01:26:40.584 --> 01:26:45.828
Request permission to land. My pilots
report almost empty fuel tanks.

01:26:46.257 --> 01:26:50.753
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.

01:26:51.596 --> 01:26:53.422
Do l have permission?

01:26:54.057 --> 01:26:58.351
Admiral Yamaguchi advises
that we attack the enemy carrier and

01:26:58.770 --> 01:27:01.059
launch our bombers at once,
however they're armed.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.229
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's
pilots will crash into the sea!

01:27:06.027 --> 01:27:08.944
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.

01:27:16.496 --> 01:27:17.776
Alright.

01:27:18.832 --> 01:27:22.082
Wait until we've recovered
all our airborne aircraft.

01:27:22.502 --> 01:27:27.413
While they are landing on the deck,
rearm our bomber with torpedoes.

01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:30.249
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.

01:27:43.272 --> 01:27:46.190
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.

01:27:47.234 --> 01:27:50.770
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

01:27:59.456 --> 01:28:01.532
Pilots, man your planes!

01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:36.175
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.

01:29:36.594 --> 01:29:40.010
Tomonaga?
- He was the last to touch down.

01:29:41.349 --> 01:29:46.806
l want to close range on the enemy
carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!

01:29:58.825 --> 01:30:00.069
From Admiral Nagumo:

01:30:00.493 --> 01:30:04.277
''Enemy force composed of
1 carrier, 5 cruisers, 5 destroyers,

01:30:04.706 --> 01:30:07.660
sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.''

01:30:08.084 --> 01:30:09.578
Dne carrier?

01:30:11.170 --> 01:30:15.120
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!

01:30:15.675 --> 01:30:21.298
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it
a few days earlier than planned.

01:30:26.769 --> 01:30:28.643
Dh, thanks, Matt.

01:30:29.063 --> 01:30:31.898
l'd give my retirement pay
to know what Nagumo's doing.

01:30:32.317 --> 01:30:36.267
The same thing we are, Admiral,
sweating it out.

01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:49.620
Skipper!

01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.000
l see it.

01:30:58.009 --> 01:31:02.718
What'd l tell you, Huntington?
The skipper can smell them out.

01:31:06.934 --> 01:31:10.351
See if you can raise Bombing 8
and Fighting 8. They must be near.

01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:13.607
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.

01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:19.232
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!

01:31:19.656 --> 01:31:22.775
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me?

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:28.658
DK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.

01:31:29.082 --> 01:31:31.407
Red Fox Leader to Kits,
we're going in!

01:31:31.834 --> 01:31:36.543
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.

01:31:36.965 --> 01:31:43.133
And stay together as long as you can.
l say again: stay in tight!

01:31:57.526 --> 01:32:01.690
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers
off port quarter!

01:32:14.168 --> 01:32:17.003
They're coming in
without fighter protection.

01:32:17.421 --> 01:32:19.710
Mindless suicide!

01:32:20.133 --> 01:32:22.968
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.

01:32:23.386 --> 01:32:27.004
We can't attack their carrier
while we're busy dodging them.

01:32:27.432 --> 01:32:29.223
They're using up all our fighters.

01:32:29.643 --> 01:32:33.640
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!

01:32:34.063 --> 01:32:36.436
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!

01:32:40.528 --> 01:32:44.478
This is Kit 6, l got 3 of them
on my tail. Somebody help me!

01:32:55.084 --> 01:32:58.251
Below you, bandits! No, no!

01:33:01.007 --> 01:33:03.379
Dh God damn! No!

01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:17.146
Stay in formation!

01:33:17.565 --> 01:33:21.777
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces!

01:33:22.195 --> 01:33:24.021
l'm hit, l'm hit! Dh, Jesus!

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.120
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!

01:33:33.832 --> 01:33:34.863
Look out!

01:33:39.295 --> 01:33:42.082
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!

01:33:51.349 --> 01:33:52.808
Huntington!

01:33:53.851 --> 01:33:55.809
Huntington, are you dead?

01:33:59.565 --> 01:34:01.060
Follow me.

01:34:21.379 --> 01:34:23.087
Waldron, get your nose up!

01:34:25.425 --> 01:34:27.631
Pull up, pull up!

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.646
What happened?
- Dne of our torpedo groups attacked.

01:35:29.072 --> 01:35:32.523
Yeah, but which one?
What the hell happened?

01:35:36.037 --> 01:35:39.323
Casualty report, Sir:
Dne of our fighters took a minor hit,

01:35:39.749 --> 01:35:43.367
no shipboard damage, no casualties.

01:35:47.965 --> 01:35:53.340
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.

01:36:13.491 --> 01:36:15.816
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.

01:36:16.244 --> 01:36:19.031
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
15 minutes to target.

01:36:19.456 --> 01:36:23.370
Who's coordinating the attack?
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.

01:36:37.682 --> 01:36:41.051
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs.

01:36:41.478 --> 01:36:44.514
l say again: Arm bombs!

01:36:49.277 --> 01:36:50.439
God damn it!

01:36:53.281 --> 01:36:56.198
Don't touch
that damned electric arming switch!

01:36:56.618 --> 01:36:59.453
Use manual control!

01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:03.738
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.

01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:06.872
Rotten gadget! Who the hell
invented the electric arming switch?

01:37:07.295 --> 01:37:11.838
Yamamoto, who else? Now what?
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs?

01:37:12.258 --> 01:37:15.758
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!

01:37:17.305 --> 01:37:19.179
Helen Leader, out.

01:37:44.457 --> 01:37:48.123
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here!

01:37:50.713 --> 01:37:51.911
l feel them!

01:37:52.882 --> 01:37:54.625
Hope he's right.

01:38:07.939 --> 01:38:09.517
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,

01:38:09.941 --> 01:38:13.772
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon!

01:38:14.195 --> 01:38:18.738
l got 3 ...
Sweet Jesus, l got 4 Jap carriers!

01:38:20.201 --> 01:38:23.535
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!

01:38:29.877 --> 01:38:32.914
Yes, sky watch?
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many?

01:38:33.339 --> 01:38:35.877
Two separate groups.

01:38:41.764 --> 01:38:46.177
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it? You boys ready?

01:38:46.895 --> 01:38:50.429
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!

01:38:50.857 --> 01:38:53.478
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:

01:38:53.902 --> 01:38:58.445
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits!

01:38:58.865 --> 01:39:01.819
l count 12
coming in from starboard, Admiral.

01:39:02.243 --> 01:39:04.117
14 from port side, Sir!

01:39:04.537 --> 01:39:07.207
All these can't be from one carrier.

01:39:07.624 --> 01:39:11.538
They must be coming from Midway.
- Dr a second carrier.

01:39:11.961 --> 01:39:16.173
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since
it sighted the one enemy carrier.

01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:18.667
Soryu should send out its scout plane.

01:39:19.093 --> 01:39:22.427
We must make certain
of what we're up against.

01:39:22.847 --> 01:39:25.255
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.

01:39:38.738 --> 01:39:41.443
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.

01:39:42.367 --> 01:39:46.495
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!

01:40:05.682 --> 01:40:10.011
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!

01:40:13.606 --> 01:40:17.105
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!

01:40:21.864 --> 01:40:23.524
Ramos, 2 o'clock!

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:32.864
Nice shootin' !

01:40:39.257 --> 01:40:41.379
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!

01:40:46.931 --> 01:40:49.636
You got him! Nice goin' !

01:40:55.606 --> 01:41:00.269
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
3 bandits at 12 o'clock divin' on you!

01:41:00.695 --> 01:41:03.186
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!

01:41:29.682 --> 01:41:34.593
We've quashed all of their attacks,
and not one torpedo has come close.

01:41:35.021 --> 01:41:38.473
Sacrifice themselves like samurai,
these Americans.

01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:44.107
That last attack pulled our entire
fighter cover down to sea level.

01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:46.986
Now they're looking for survivors.

01:41:48.034 --> 01:41:50.572
We have no fighter umbrella over us?
- No, Sir.

01:41:50.995 --> 01:41:54.744
We're trying to recall them,
get them back up to patrol altitude.

01:41:55.166 --> 01:41:59.745
How many fighters are standing by
to cover our attack on that carrier?

01:42:00.171 --> 01:42:02.497
Barely enough to do the job.

01:42:28.116 --> 01:42:31.449
They're American carriers,
no doubt about it, Yorktown class.

01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:34.443
Get through
to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!

01:42:41.546 --> 01:42:43.004
Why are you waiting?

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:46.626
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!

01:43:01.899 --> 01:43:03.773
What's it look like down there?

01:43:08.239 --> 01:43:09.614
A Jap destroyer!

01:43:10.616 --> 01:43:13.570
Going someplace
in one hell of a hurry.

01:43:18.208 --> 01:43:20.496
DK, follow it. See where it leads us.

01:43:21.711 --> 01:43:25.495
Commander McClusky, look at
the fuel gauge. We have to turn back.

01:43:25.923 --> 01:43:28.000
l know, l know.

01:43:34.057 --> 01:43:39.513
The last two attacks were made
by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!

01:43:39.937 --> 01:43:43.472
There is more than one
enemy carrier nearby. There must be!

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:47.186
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't
the Soryu's scout plane reported?

01:43:47.612 --> 01:43:51.111
We don't know. lt should have sighted
the American ships 10 minutes ago.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.485
Sir, all the bombers
are rearmed and ready.

01:44:00.375 --> 01:44:04.242
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.963
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!

01:44:18.393 --> 01:44:23.434
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till l report contact!

01:44:24.482 --> 01:44:27.317
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:

01:44:27.735 --> 01:44:31.187
Have them in sight.
4 enemy carriers.

01:44:31.614 --> 01:44:35.778
l say again: 4 enemy carriers.

01:44:47.088 --> 01:44:50.089
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!

01:44:50.508 --> 01:44:52.584
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

01:44:53.928 --> 01:44:58.923
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

01:45:00.936 --> 01:45:04.719
l'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.

01:45:05.815 --> 01:45:08.935
Keep trying. We're supposed to
coordinate our attack.

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.355
Either their navigation is fouled up
or this is the wrong rendezvous point.

01:45:14.782 --> 01:45:16.656
Keep trying, damn it!

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:19.034
Mabel Leader, come in!

01:45:24.375 --> 01:45:28.207
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning
into the wind, preparing to launch.

01:45:28.630 --> 01:45:31.299
l don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.

01:45:31.716 --> 01:45:34.503
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in!

01:45:38.139 --> 01:45:42.600
lt's no use. Commander Massey
and Commander Thach don't answer.

01:45:43.019 --> 01:45:45.261
DK, hang on. We're going in.

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:50.315
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can
draw some heat off the guys that do.

01:45:50.735 --> 01:45:55.562
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate
on that big bastard up forward.

01:46:57.593 --> 01:47:02.256
Commander McClusky, they've got
bombs all over their flight deck!

01:47:03.266 --> 01:47:04.725
Bull's eye!

01:47:10.815 --> 01:47:14.860
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!

01:47:15.278 --> 01:47:19.774
Raven Leader to Raven 6.
l got a hit, Commander McClusky.

01:47:20.658 --> 01:47:23.445
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!

01:47:28.333 --> 01:47:30.658
Bull's eye!

01:47:33.796 --> 01:47:38.791
Commander, l got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:41.751
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.311
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.410
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky?

01:48:31.062 --> 01:48:35.190
Helen Leader to squadron:
3 enemy carriers burning.

01:48:35.608 --> 01:48:37.565
Time to go home.

01:49:15.606 --> 01:49:18.892
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.

01:49:19.318 --> 01:49:21.856
The cruiser Nagara is close by.

01:49:23.198 --> 01:49:27.147
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi.

01:49:31.915 --> 01:49:35.533
l can't tell you where to find the
enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.005
Their last position was radioed
by scout 4 several hours ago.

01:49:40.423 --> 01:49:44.373
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir?
- lt hasn't been heard from.

01:49:44.802 --> 01:49:51.137
Then how do l find them, Sir?
- Fly to their last reported position.

01:49:51.559 --> 01:49:55.639
Then just trust your luck
that somehow you will find them.

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:13.706
Do you hear anything? - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.

01:50:20.755 --> 01:50:23.756
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- l see them.

01:50:28.763 --> 01:50:30.803
Dur fighters
are forming for an attack!

01:50:33.184 --> 01:50:37.728
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back ... - Stay off the radio!

01:50:38.147 --> 01:50:41.896
We'll let them
lead us to their carrier.

01:50:52.287 --> 01:50:57.162
l got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes?

01:50:57.583 --> 01:50:58.959
Dff the port quarter, Sir.

01:51:06.217 --> 01:51:10.297
l'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:15.951
Jesus!

01:52:32.637 --> 01:52:34.594
He's alive, Captain.

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.674
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.

01:52:39.102 --> 01:52:44.523
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
020 degrees, 30 miles and approaching.

01:52:44.941 --> 01:52:49.152
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
020 degrees, approaching, 30 miles.

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.228
Sound general quarters!

01:54:35.051 --> 01:54:38.633
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:43.924
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't
send visual signals in this smoke.

01:54:44.352 --> 01:54:47.353
You better transfer the flag, Sir.
l suggest to the Astoria.

01:54:47.772 --> 01:54:52.149
Matt, you better stay aboard,
help Murray with the flight ops.

01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:57.071
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!

01:55:03.913 --> 01:55:09.156
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire!

01:55:10.003 --> 01:55:14.000
l repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.

01:55:14.424 --> 01:55:19.845
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None
of the senior officers survived.

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:24.430
The scout plane from the Soryu
is approaching. His radio is out.

01:55:29.438 --> 01:55:34.266
He's gonna be DK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.

01:55:54.839 --> 01:55:56.547
Hi, Dad.

01:55:59.844 --> 01:56:02.514
l'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.

01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:11.269
There's a picture of Haruko and me
that l'd like you to bring ashore.

01:56:13.316 --> 01:56:15.143
l'll take care of it, Tiger.

01:56:21.282 --> 01:56:22.657
Thanks, Dad.

01:56:31.209 --> 01:56:34.957
Dnly 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again?

01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:40.041
Yes, Sir. l think l can guarantee
you 15 knots in an hour.

01:56:40.468 --> 01:56:45.426
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang
the topside fires are under control.

01:56:45.849 --> 01:56:47.473
Aye-aye, Sir.

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:53.517
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me?

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.315
Sure.

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.898
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

01:57:03.199 --> 01:57:06.568
Did you confirm it?
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.

01:57:06.995 --> 01:57:10.909
''Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
1st report, 3 enemy carriers afire.''

01:57:11.333 --> 01:57:12.577
Hallelujah!

01:57:13.001 --> 01:57:19.003
3 of their 1st-line carriers, Admiral!
lsn't that worth a ''hot-diggity-damn''?

01:57:19.423 --> 01:57:23.718
Good advice, Joe, but there's still
that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:27.671
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.

01:57:28.099 --> 01:57:32.262
Badly? - Yes, but she's underway.
- Dperational?

01:57:32.687 --> 01:57:37.895
Dur whole force may be in jeopardy
if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:40.725
They still have a tremendous fleet.

01:57:41.154 --> 01:57:44.071
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.

01:57:45.325 --> 01:57:48.943
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.

01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:53.451
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home?

01:57:53.875 --> 01:57:56.366
Before they can hurt us again? Yes.

01:58:00.006 --> 01:58:02.461
That may be the smart play.

01:58:02.884 --> 01:58:07.130
Trouble is: l want that 4th carrier!

01:58:21.611 --> 01:58:24.731
What's wrong?
- Your right wing tank is punctured.

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:29.695
We haven't had time to repair it.
- ls the left tank fueled? - Yes, Sir.

01:58:30.411 --> 01:58:33.496
A few hours ago
we filled the sky with our planes.

01:58:33.915 --> 01:58:39.289
Now we win or lose
with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.

01:58:47.637 --> 01:58:51.931
The skipper wants to know, can you
maintain this speed? - 18 knots.

01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:56.562
Very good. - All we gotta do
is find that 4th Jap flattop.

01:58:56.979 --> 01:58:59.186
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.

01:58:59.607 --> 01:59:03.985
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.

01:59:05.113 --> 01:59:07.650
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.

01:59:08.074 --> 01:59:12.072
We found him, Delaney. Just give us
all the old lady's got left.

01:59:13.663 --> 01:59:16.332
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:21.541
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!

01:59:21.963 --> 01:59:24.715
Let's get everything airborne
while we still can.

01:59:25.133 --> 01:59:28.798
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!

02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:51.755
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!

02:01:09.737 --> 02:01:12.608
Watch out! Get down!

02:02:21.309 --> 02:02:26.054
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier!

02:02:26.522 --> 02:02:30.472
l repeat: Two torpedoes
hit the carrier! Returning to base.

02:02:30.902 --> 02:02:34.852
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.

02:02:38.827 --> 02:02:41.448
Delaney, what's the situation below?

02:02:41.871 --> 02:02:44.444
No good. All boilers are out.

02:02:44.874 --> 02:02:48.706
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:56.635
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.

02:02:57.053 --> 02:03:00.801
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes ...

02:03:03.643 --> 02:03:06.430
How many are we sending out?
- 24 dive-bombers.

02:03:06.854 --> 02:03:10.104
We'll have to try it
without fighter protection.

02:03:10.525 --> 02:03:12.933
What about the Hornet?
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.

02:03:13.361 --> 02:03:19.031
16 dive-bombers left, and Matt Garth
is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.

02:03:19.451 --> 02:03:23.744
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.

02:04:32.648 --> 02:04:35.140
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:38.854
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.325
Kobayashi said the carrier was
on fire. Did you see any smoke?

02:04:43.743 --> 02:04:47.361
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.

02:04:47.789 --> 02:04:50.410
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!

02:06:10.204 --> 02:06:13.408
Sir, we must withdraw.

02:06:15.710 --> 02:06:18.913
How will we apologize to His Majesty?

02:06:19.339 --> 02:06:21.166
Leave that to me.

02:06:21.591 --> 02:06:28.258
l am the only one
who must apologize to His Majesty.

02:06:44.447 --> 02:06:45.692
Thank you.

02:06:47.033 --> 02:06:49.987
That was the LSD, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.

02:06:50.411 --> 02:06:52.368
His plane is all shot up.

02:08:27.634 --> 02:08:31.713
l wonder if Matt knew how big we won.

02:08:32.138 --> 02:08:34.510
l think l know what he'd have said:

02:08:36.226 --> 02:08:39.226
''lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:41.389
Yamamoto had everything going for him,

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:45.433
power, experience, confidence ...

02:08:46.903 --> 02:08:52.110
Were we better than the Japanese,
or just luckier?''
