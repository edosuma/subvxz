Kamale and them took everything.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.538
The fuck you talking about?

02:08.538 --> 02:10.178
They had a gun to may face, bruv.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.620
Wha gwan?

02:18.740 --> 02:22.580
He was with all of them. I couldn't
do nothing by myself, bruv.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.140
This is some joke thing, right?

02:58.140 --> 02:59.140
Mum.

03:03.820 --> 03:05.420
You going to get out of bed today?

03:07.220 --> 03:10.140
What are you doing?!
It's too bright!

03:19.580 --> 03:21.860
You should try and eat something.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.899
You need a new colour in here, Mum.

03:34.900 --> 03:37.219
It's making you depressed.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.580
I'm going to paint it for you.

03:51.820 --> 03:52.900
Ra'Nell!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.220
Ra'Nell, it's Gem!

04:04.419 --> 04:05.780
Kamale come in and took the food.

04:05.781 --> 04:07.339
That's not my problem.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.539
I got to tell Bobby that you let
Kamale come and take his food away.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.139
Hold on, Lee, we done
warned you about Kamale

04:13.140 --> 04:14.380
and them London Fields, man.

04:14.381 --> 04:17.298
Dushane, you're not listening.
You owe Bobby three grand.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.658
How can we owe three grand

04:18.659 --> 04:20.817
when you're the one supposedly
runnin' Summerhouse, bruv?

04:20.819 --> 04:22.500
Who the fuck are you talking to?

04:22.501 --> 04:25.419
Hey, listen. Come on, man.
We're going to get your money.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.500
When?

04:26.501 --> 04:27.500
A week.

04:28.860 --> 04:32.659
You'll keep Bobby Raikes waiting
a week for his paper? Good luck.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.378
So why don't you cover us, then?

04:34.379 --> 04:36.858
I'm not pickin' up
your fucking debts, you prick.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.140
Go on, fuck off. I'm eating.
Fuck off.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.418
I'm sick of that fat fuck,
you know.

04:48.419 --> 04:49.538
I'm telling you now,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.300
we ain't getting nowhere
with this guy on top of us.

04:52.301 --> 04:54.339
We need to go
and talk to Raikes direct.

04:54.340 --> 04:56.739
Bro, we can't talk to Raikes direct,
bruv.

04:56.740 --> 05:00.099
Especially
if we ain't got that paper for him.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.380
I know you can help, man,
with this fact.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.139
Femi.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.978
Femi.

05:07.979 --> 05:09.978
A lot of the boys
don't do cards no more.

05:09.979 --> 05:11.740
Some of them even had to get jobs.

05:11.741 --> 05:14.859
It's that Chip and PIN, man -
it's made it hard for all of us.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.338
Even the Postman.

05:16.339 --> 05:18.378
Used to be you could
get a postman easy,

05:18.379 --> 05:20.818
but now they're all scared -
they check up on them now.

05:20.819 --> 05:23.180
What you saying?
I might need this real quick, bruv.

05:23.181 --> 05:24.859
I'll talk to my postman.

05:24.860 --> 05:25.938
Why don't you do that, then?

05:25.939 --> 05:27.260
Femi!

05:29.980 --> 05:31.778
That didn't sound too positive.

05:31.779 --> 05:33.258
He'll come through.

05:33.259 --> 05:34.540
Fucking hope so, mate.

06:12.980 --> 06:17.780
CHILDREN CHATTER

06:43.540 --> 06:45.738
You want that bit?
Want me to weigh that for you?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.700
Nice piece of yam that is, darling.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.499
Here, let me weigh it for you.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.980
Yeah?

07:00.180 --> 07:03.339
Want anything else? £7.30.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.419
Here, take it, darling.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.698
Take it.

07:06.699 --> 07:08.540
Pay me next time, yeah?

07:18.900 --> 07:19.860
(Stop it.)

07:21.700 --> 07:24.059
(Stop looking at me.)

07:24.060 --> 07:26.540
(I don't want no-one looking at me.)

07:27.860 --> 07:29.180
Stop it!

07:30.180 --> 07:31.380
Don't look at me!

07:31.381 --> 07:32.780
CLATTERING

07:55.220 --> 07:58.020
You OK? Can I help you?

08:00.020 --> 08:01.020
Oh, my gosh!

08:05.500 --> 08:07.860
'Do you have a history
of mental illness, Lisa?'

08:17.460 --> 08:21.900
OK, we think the best thing
would be for you to come in.

08:23.340 --> 08:30.059
Is there anyone at home?

08:30.060 --> 08:31.940
Do you have you any children?

08:33.740 --> 08:35.140
Lisa?

08:38.820 --> 08:42.340
Because obviously, if you did,
we'd need to see about their care.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.979
I ain't got no children.

08:48.980 --> 08:50.300
PHONE CHIMES

08:51.740 --> 08:54.459
It's Precious again, man.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.538
You're a liar!

08:55.539 --> 08:56.540
Why would I lie?

08:57.860 --> 09:01.139
Hey, Dushane, wha gwan
for my man, Ra'Nell?

09:01.140 --> 09:04.459
Who is he?

09:04.460 --> 09:05.338
Shanked up his dad last year.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.020
What, that's Wayne Smith's kid?

09:07.021 --> 09:11.939
Yeah, cuz.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.218
You know who I am, innit.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.058
Everybody knows you, Dushane.

09:15.059 --> 09:16.140
Come here.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.580
I want to ask you something.

09:21.581 --> 09:25.299
Ain't it about time
you started rolling with us?

09:25.300 --> 09:26.940
I can't do that.
My mum wouldn't like it.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.060
Look, hold that.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.339
What's wrong with you?

09:36.340 --> 09:37.818
You don't want the money?

09:37.819 --> 09:39.060
All right, all right.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.459
You know what? It's cool. Cool.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.459
Listen. Anyone bullying you

09:43.460 --> 09:45.620
or disrespecting you,
you let me know, yeah?

09:45.621 --> 09:47.340
I'll sort that out for you.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.620
Smart yout'.

09:55.621 --> 09:57.659
Bruv, what's wrong with you?

09:57.660 --> 09:59.578
If someone offers you money,
take it.

09:59.579 --> 10:01.420
Especially when it's
someone like Dushane.

10:01.421 --> 10:02.939
That's you, not me, innit.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.179
She's not even here, bruv.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.899
Stop.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.940
You all right?

10:36.260 --> 10:39.620
You want to go down the chippie
and get something to eat?

10:40.700 --> 10:43.059
Nah, man. I'll wait for my mum.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.059
You go, innit.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.860
Nah, it's cool, I'll wait with you.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.340
Gem.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.740
Gem, wake up.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.380
Gem, you should go home.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.858

See you in the morning.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.179
Hello, Mum, it's me. Where are you?

12:18.180 --> 12:20.100
When are you coming home?

12:49.620 --> 12:50.620
Yo, bruva.

12:55.460 --> 12:59.139
It's a good address. Swiss Cottage.
£5,000 on there.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.539
Pin, code ten, everything.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.420
But you have something for me, yeah?

13:03.421 --> 13:05.099
I will have. What?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.859
Give me three days, I'll get it.

13:06.860 --> 13:09.499
Are you trying to boy me off?
I already paid my postman.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.539
What the fuck's your problem,
blood? You ain't takin' no risks.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.979
It's man that's puttin' in
the work out here.

13:15.980 --> 13:17.579
I want my money, Dushane.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.899
It's free money, man. Chill out.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.940
Fucking ponce.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.100
All right, Kerry?

13:28.101 --> 13:29.619
Hiya. I'm fine, how are you?

13:29.620 --> 13:30.858
Anything new for today?

13:30.859 --> 13:33.340
No, it's all exactly the same
as yesterday.

13:33.341 --> 13:35.420
Cool.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.380
Lisa?

14:00.540 --> 14:01.500
Lisa, it's Leon.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.700
When did you come in here, Lise?

14:09.220 --> 14:11.180
Lisa, how long you been in here?

14:13.980 --> 14:16.660
Someone lookin' after Ra'Nell?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.939
What you doin', man?

14:28.940 --> 14:32.419
We're going to need brushes, innit.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.460
You know what,
I can't even afford this.

14:34.461 --> 14:36.180
Shit, they're taking the piss.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.539
Ra'Nell? Hello, Ra'Nell.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.820
Oh, you all right, Heather?

14:40.821 --> 14:42.819
All right? What ya doing?

14:42.820 --> 14:43.940
Painting my mum's room.

14:43.941 --> 14:45.579
What colour?

14:45.580 --> 14:46.940
Loyal wheat.

14:49.780 --> 14:52.939
That's nice.

14:52.940 --> 14:55.139
Are you pregnant or just fat?

14:55.140 --> 14:56.100
Hey, shut up, man.

14:56.101 --> 14:57.779
Seven months, only two to go.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.459
Have you done the scan?

14:59.460 --> 15:01.660
Listen to you talking
about scans and stuff.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.340
Why do you need all them lights?

15:04.341 --> 15:07.939
I'm doing up a flat and there's not
much natural light in there.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.780
Be well bright with all of them.

15:09.781 --> 15:12.140
Yeah. I'm guessing it will be.

15:13.620 --> 15:16.019
You boys got five minutes?

15:16.020 --> 15:17.140
Yeah.

15:17.141 --> 15:19.860
Come on, you can help me
with this stuff to the car.

15:22.140 --> 15:24.339
Here, take that.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.939
Nah, you're all right.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.419
Thank you.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.700
Man, what ya doin'?

15:29.701 --> 15:32.739
Oh, he's all right. You deserve it.

15:32.740 --> 15:36.739
Thank you, boys.

15:36.740 --> 15:38.699
Say hello to your mum for me.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.059
Yeah, I will.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.979
She's a milf.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.459
Shut up, man.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.099
What, so you're telling me

15:47.100 --> 15:48.420
THEY LAUGH

16:02.660 --> 16:07.979
Flat this big, you get a very good
crop. Very good crop.

16:07.980 --> 16:12.339
Don't worry. You don't have
to do nothing.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.099
I take care of everything.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.420
Cool.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.379
You're a friend of my dad's.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.860
I was, I ain't seen Wayne
in a long time.

16:39.861 --> 16:41.579
How do I know you're not lying?

16:41.580 --> 16:44.939
You don't, you're just going
to have to trust me.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.098
I'm here about your mum.

16:46.099 --> 16:47.380
What about my mum?

16:47.381 --> 16:49.940
She's OK, but she's in hospital.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.659
What do you mean she's in hospital?

16:53.660 --> 16:57.859
Don't worry, she's not sick.

16:57.860 --> 16:58.940
She'll be all right.

16:58.941 --> 17:01.700
I brought you some jerk chicken.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.740
You better save me some, y'know!

17:21.300 --> 17:25.739
I'm guessing you don't want
to stay with your dad?

17:25.740 --> 17:29.819
No. I don't even know
where the fuck he is.

17:29.820 --> 17:32.939
Thing is, if you ain't got
no-one to stay with,

17:32.940 --> 17:35.619
no family or nothin',
they're going to put you into care.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.300
That's why your mum never told
the doctors about you.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.738
I'm not going into care,
I can look after myself.

17:41.739 --> 17:43.420
But she might not be back
for a while.

17:43.421 --> 17:45.180
I said I ain't going into care!

17:53.940 --> 17:56.900
OK. This is what we're going to do.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.579
You're going to stay here.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.780
But under my terms, yeah?

18:06.180 --> 18:08.619
Right, you go to school every day.

18:08.620 --> 18:14.339
You keep yourself and this place
clean for your mum.

18:14.340 --> 18:18.820
No hanging out on the estate and you
go to your bed at night - early.

18:19.780 --> 18:20.940
That's the deal.

18:20.941 --> 18:23.700
Now, can you cook?

18:25.620 --> 18:27.700
I can bring you some stuff
you can heat up.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.500
When do I get to visit her?

18:32.580 --> 18:35.859
That's going to be tricky,
cos if the doctors see you,

18:35.860 --> 18:37.940
they put two and two together and...

18:42.060 --> 18:43.819
I'll see what I can do.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.419
If I write a note,
would you give it to her?

18:46.420 --> 18:48.099
Yeah, course.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.020
Now eat up.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.180
LOUD MUSIC

19:02.780 --> 19:04.660
INAUDIBLE CHATTER

19:07.420 --> 19:09.380
LOUD MUSIC CONTINUES

19:16.620 --> 19:18.139
What the fuck's he doing here?

19:18.140 --> 19:19.620
Who's that, Lee?

19:19.621 --> 19:22.139
Soldier outta Summerhouse.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.340
Is he the one
that lost our bit of grub?

19:24.341 --> 19:26.420
Yeah, that's the cunt.

19:28.340 --> 19:29.460
You've got fucking cheek.
What ya doin'?

19:29.461 --> 19:32.819
Came to give Bobby his paper.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.859
I want to give it to him personally.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.500
Give me the fucking paper, mate.
Go on, go on, gimme.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.060
Fuck you, you cunt.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.500
Sit down.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.898
What's your name, kid?

19:59.899 --> 20:00.900
Dushane.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.980
Yeah.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.778
It don't want to be shy.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.138
It's all there, man.

20:11.139 --> 20:12.060
You got two minutes.

20:12.061 --> 20:17.379
Let me ask you a question, yeah?

20:17.380 --> 20:20.099
Feds know people are buying
and selling in Hackney.

20:20.100 --> 20:25.619
Now, as long as we don't make no
noise, they don't really care.

20:25.620 --> 20:28.100
It's part of the fabric
of life, innit?

20:28.101 --> 20:31.779
Fabric of life? Look, this is all
very interesting but...

20:31.780 --> 20:35.219
Let me run Summerhouse.

20:35.220 --> 20:38.499
That position's filled,
you know that.

20:38.500 --> 20:42.539
I ain't dubbing Lee or nothin',
but you think Kamale

20:42.540 --> 20:49.619
and them London Fields boys can come in to
Summerhouse if Lee is doing his job right?

20:49.620 --> 20:53.700
But that don't change what happened,
man, and it shouldn't have happened.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.300
So what do you want from me?

20:57.301 --> 20:59.859
Eight ounces of brown, to start.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.339
Eight?

21:01.340 --> 21:03.099
I can move that easy.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.058
So you want to do business
with me, yeah?

21:05.059 --> 21:05.538
That's right.

21:05.539 --> 21:06.218
Why?

21:06.219 --> 21:07.578
I want a life.

21:07.579 --> 21:09.420
But you're breathing, ain't you?

21:09.421 --> 21:13.779
I want a good life. I was born
and bred in Summerhouse.

21:13.780 --> 21:16.539
I'm 26 years old.

21:16.540 --> 21:21.739
I got nothing else to be,
'cept this.

21:21.740 --> 21:28.940
I was born in Summerhouse.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.180
We going to do business or what?

21:35.060 --> 21:36.739
'Light, very important.'

21:36.740 --> 21:39.499
Always keep this distance from here.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.820
What about the water?

21:40.821 --> 21:42.619
Water is here. Pump is always on.

21:42.620 --> 21:43.820
You like gardening?

21:43.821 --> 21:46.619
I love gardening but it's not like
growing tomatoes.

21:46.620 --> 21:47.140
Same, same but different.

21:47.141 --> 21:49.939
You don't go to prison
for growing tomatoes!

21:49.940 --> 21:53.059
Most important thing not to go
to prison is smell.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.060
Smell?

21:54.061 --> 21:55.579
Smell from plant very strong.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.259
Extractor take away the smell.

21:58.260 --> 22:00.380
How long does it take
to grow a crop?

22:00.381 --> 22:06.179
13 weeks. When you grow,
you must always have shiny leaf.

22:06.180 --> 22:08.419
Dark green. Pale, no good.
Yellow, no good.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.860
Means you not feed it right.

22:09.861 --> 22:12.779
Every day, you check the pH water.

22:12.780 --> 22:17.500
Temperature. Make sure pump is
always working. Shiny, shiny leaf.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.219
You want, I buy your crop off you.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.018
What you going to give me for it?

22:22.019 --> 22:23.218
I give you good price.

22:23.219 --> 22:24.260
What price?

22:24.261 --> 22:26.059
Good price.

22:26.060 --> 22:33.140
No, Vincent, I need the exact price.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.420
What's goin' on?

22:47.421 --> 22:49.260
What's happenin'? All right?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.219
What's this?

22:54.220 --> 22:55.500
There's a name in there.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.660
It's got to be this one,
the right one.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.740
Y'all right, girl? What ya saying?

23:34.420 --> 23:36.459
Ra'Nell put some
clothes together for you.

23:36.460 --> 23:38.540
He asked me to give you this.

23:42.940 --> 23:44.579
He's a good kid, ya know.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.899
He's got some fire in his belly.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.380
He's all right.

23:49.820 --> 23:54.659
Listen, Lis.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.699
And that's all right for now.

23:56.700 --> 23:59.499
But I've seen too many people
stay doped up on these things,

23:59.500 --> 24:02.819
and that ain't no way
to get better, trust me.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.139
So, when you're feeling up to it,

24:05.140 --> 24:08.339
I want you to come to
the gym and train.

24:08.340 --> 24:12.179
It'll do you good,
and don't worry about Ra'Nell.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.779
I'll look after him.

24:13.780 --> 24:20.340
It'll be all right.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.299
If your mum doesn't come home
tonight, you going to tell someone?

24:36.300 --> 24:38.498
I don't need to,
I already know where she is.

24:38.499 --> 24:39.460
Where?

24:42.420 --> 24:43.740
Come on, tell me.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.458
They put her in a mental hospital.

24:47.459 --> 24:48.700
No.

24:48.701 --> 24:50.700
When is she coming home?

24:50.701 --> 24:52.819
I don't know.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.579
Shit.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.220
She'll be all right though, yeah?

24:56.221 --> 24:59.019
Yeah, hopefully.
Can't even visit her.

24:59.020 --> 25:01.899
If they found out about me,
they'd put me in care.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.498
So don't be telling no one, bro.

25:03.499 --> 25:04.940
I won't.

25:08.660 --> 25:09.820
Marnie!

25:22.580 --> 25:24.659
'Keep your head still, bro.'

25:24.660 --> 25:26.619
I'm talking.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.980
How am I supposed to talk
if I can't move my head?

25:28.981 --> 25:31.219
I can talk without moving my head,
watch me.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.779
Did you see my head move?

25:32.780 --> 25:34.819
That's cos you're talking shit,
cuz.

25:34.820 --> 25:38.059
My head moves when I talk cos
I talk important shit.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.579
To fuck up my hair.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.419
You're done.

25:42.420 --> 25:46.100
Nah, nah, I'm not done, Fam, look.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.058
Are you Rossie?

26:35.059 --> 26:36.060
Who's asking?

26:40.460 --> 26:41.380
Come on, man.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.018
What's wrong with you? Hurry up.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.300
Fucking open it!

26:46.980 --> 26:47.860
Keep still, man.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.580
Fuckin' hold him down.

27:09.860 --> 27:11.020
What?

27:11.021 --> 27:12.739
It's the wrong finger.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.980
Bruv, they ain't gonna know
the fucking difference.

27:14.981 --> 27:18.299
Of course they'll know the fuckin'
difference, bruv, look.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.259
They look the same to me.

27:20.260 --> 27:23.139
I'm telling you, you need
to get the right finger.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.939
You saying I need to cut
the other finger off now?

27:26.940 --> 27:29.379
Attention to detail, innit?

27:29.380 --> 27:31.139
Come on.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.578
You're sick.

27:32.579 --> 27:33.460
Come on.

27:35.900 --> 27:39.379
My sister's kid, 17 years old,
got a glass eye,

27:39.380 --> 27:44.939
all because this got
poked in his face.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.259
Now a situation has become vacant.

27:47.260 --> 27:51.299
My mate here, Lee, he's moving up.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.260
Congratulations.

27:52.261 --> 27:55.979
So that means that you two and me
are going to do business together,

27:55.980 --> 28:00.459
but we're going to do business
exactly how I say.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.019
Because what this is,
is a special relationship.

28:03.020 --> 28:05.339
I'm trusting you with my food.

28:05.340 --> 28:06.980
You can trust us.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.100
I know that I can trust you.

28:14.420 --> 28:16.419
Because I know who your family are.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.420
Give 'em the parcel.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.699
Bring me the paper in a week.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.139
What about Kamale?

28:25.140 --> 28:28.579
What about him?
You're running Summerhouse now.

28:28.580 --> 28:31.020
Whatever you feel to do, fine by me.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.540
What you saying, cuz?

29:08.541 --> 29:10.060
Nah chill man, jam.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.859
I came to tell you we're running
Summerhouse now.

29:13.860 --> 29:17.179
All them stunts you pulled before,
coming in and taking man's food,

29:17.180 --> 29:18.859
can't happen again, understand?

29:18.860 --> 29:21.099
What about Lee Greene?

29:21.100 --> 29:30.140
Don't worry about Lee Greene,
he's moved on.

29:34.220 --> 29:35.378
What ya doing, man?!

29:35.379 --> 29:37.620
Stay the fuck out of Summerhouse,
ya listening?

29:42.300 --> 29:44.580
You know me, I don't
come nowhere to talk, blud.

29:44.581 --> 29:48.219
Anyway, I saw his face.
He weren't even listenin' to you.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.060
You know what you started now, innit?

29:50.061 --> 29:55.300
He already started it.

31:11.100 --> 31:16.460
INDISTINCT CHATTER

31:33.540 --> 31:36.699
Listen, we've got this place in
Finchley, all set up, ready to go.

31:36.700 --> 31:40.099
Going country, that's full on,
that's 24/7.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.340
You sure you can handle
that sort of pressure?

31:42.341 --> 31:44.419
They know what they have to do.

31:44.420 --> 31:45.620
How much do you want?

31:47.220 --> 31:48.940
Box of each.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.100
That's a lot of money.

31:56.020 --> 31:58.940
You better know what you're doing.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.339
Oi!

32:09.340 --> 32:11.740
Come here, let me
talk to you quick.

32:15.340 --> 32:18.099
See, Dris, Chantelle.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.099
They're all making mad paper,
you know.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.179
Even little Michael, ten years old.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.939
Making his money.

32:23.940 --> 32:26.299
What are you lot saying?
Want to make paper?

32:26.300 --> 32:27.819
Yeah, I do.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.900
What about you, Ra'Nell?

32:31.260 --> 32:34.059
Look, bruv, I know your mum's
in the Hackney nuthouse.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.259
I didn't say nothing, I swear.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.699
Don't worry, bruv, this is
Summerhouse, word gets around.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.099
Look, I know how it
is with family and that.

32:43.100 --> 32:47.539
I know your dad ain't around,
but we are.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.459
It's you that has to step
up for her like a man, ya know.

32:50.460 --> 32:51.820
Take care of her and all that.

32:51.821 --> 32:55.539
Listen, we're your family now.

32:55.540 --> 32:59.259
Think of all these lot
as your cousins, you get me?

32:59.260 --> 33:01.260
We'll look out for you, Fam,
don't worry.

33:05.860 --> 33:08.299
I'm going to pick you lot up, innit.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.819
When?

33:09.820 --> 33:12.339
When you see me,
that's when it is.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.218
Fucking hell man, when?

33:14.219 --> 33:15.618
Just be ready.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.500
Bruv, we're going to be rich.

33:26.980 --> 33:28.859
You know how gay you look?

33:28.860 --> 33:32.299
Shut the fuck up.
You know how fucking skinny you look?

33:32.300 --> 33:32.860
Prick

33:32.861 --> 33:37.219
You think I'm joking?

33:37.220 --> 33:39.739
I got a knife. I don't have
to do none of this gay shit.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.419
What ya saying, Shane?

33:41.420 --> 33:42.780
Hey, what ya saying, man?

33:42.781 --> 33:45.299
I need to ask you a favour.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.660
What is it?

33:48.340 --> 33:53.099
I'd appreciate it if you

33:53.100 --> 33:54.458
His mum's a good friend of mine.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.500
So what, bruv?

33:55.501 --> 33:59.619
Still got nothing to do with you.
Like this is our thing.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.219
If we want to talk to someone,
we're going to talk to them.

34:03.220 --> 34:05.660
I'm looking after him
while his mum's in hospital.

34:05.661 --> 34:07.739
I promised I'd keep him
out of trouble.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.620
Didn't you just hear what he said?

34:10.980 --> 34:13.018
Think about it, yeah?

34:13.020 --> 34:15.179
Plenty other kids out there, man.

34:24.340 --> 34:25.978
What are you thinking about?

34:25.980 --> 34:28.139
Who the fuck does he think he is?

34:30.179 --> 34:31.260
You know what?

34:32.659 --> 34:33.538
Leave Ra'Nell out this time, yeah?

34:33.539 --> 34:34.739
What, cos of him?

34:34.741 --> 34:36.899
It's more trouble than it's worth.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.978
Fuck him.

34:38.980 --> 34:41.018
Come.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.900
Yo, get up, jump on this bar.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.219
We're done.

34:46.221 --> 34:47.739
Got shit to do.

34:47.739 --> 34:49.179
Come on, man.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.219
Yo.

35:11.220 --> 35:13.939
You good?

35:13.940 --> 35:14.618
Get in the car, man.

35:14.619 --> 35:15.820
I need to get my dog.

35:15.821 --> 35:24.779
You wanna make money or you wanna
take your dog for a walk?

35:24.780 --> 35:26.180
What you talkin' about?

35:26.181 --> 35:27.859
You ain't comin'.

35:27.860 --> 35:28.660

35:28.661 --> 35:31.660

36:07.340 --> 36:11.700
Only joking, man.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.220
Oi, tell him I'm only joking.

36:18.340 --> 36:20.939
Gem, you ever been country before?

36:20.940 --> 36:25.979
I went once
to Hampshire with my nan.

36:25.980 --> 36:28.619
He though we're going to country
with nan, or something.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.299
He did not just say that.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.339
Nah, nah, nah. That's not the kind of
country he's talking about.

36:34.340 --> 36:37.019
Listen, Gem. There's a
whole 'nother country.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.620
It's not that place you
been before. Trust me.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.700
He's talking about his fuckin' nan.

36:48.780 --> 36:49.900
You OK?

37:23.460 --> 37:28.540
DOORS SLAM SHUT

37:33.420 --> 37:34.740
DUBSTEP MUSIC

37:34.741 --> 37:37.699
Burst his brain, blud.

37:37.700 --> 37:41.499
This is shit, man.
You can't even fucking play.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.579
Thing's hard, bro.
You get sore thumbs!

37:44.580 --> 37:47.620
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

37:51.820 --> 37:53.179
You lot listen, yeah.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.339
This is Robert, my best fiend.

37:55.340 --> 38:02.539
Hey, wake up, man. What's wrong
with you? Gazin' on the game, man.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.898
In't that right, Robert?

38:03.899 --> 38:04.980
Yeah?

38:06.300 --> 38:09.139
Yeah? Go sit over there or

38:09.140 --> 38:10.260
Fuck, man.

38:12.980 --> 38:15.060
Make sure you bring

38:16.540 --> 38:20.260
Nice to meet you, fam.
Fuck, say summat.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.340
This place is dirty.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.859
Oi, listen. Man's gonna blitz

Yo, come here, let me talk to you.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.779
Come, Rob, get up, man.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.540
Or go in the other room, man.
What's wrong with you?

38:47.260 --> 38:49.700
Now, it's a simple ting, bruv.
All you got to remember

38:49.701 --> 38:52.299
is make sure you bring back
the right money every time.

38:52.300 --> 38:55.699
You understand? All right,
otherwise it's gonna get political.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.859
I don't care if it's even
like £5 - it don't matter.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.979
You get me? It's the principal.

39:00.980 --> 39:04.580
All right, that £5 there
represents respect, yeah?

39:06.940 --> 39:10.299
Anyone fucks up, it reflects
one everyone, you understand?

39:10.300 --> 39:13.060
All right,
go and do your ting, man. Go on.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.299
Come and get this crack in.
Fuck all this game shit, man.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.019
But I just don't get it.

39:19.020 --> 39:22.699
Look, all you have to do, yeah,
is practise with your tongue, innit.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.860
Get it all agile, look see.
Drop to the back like this.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.019
Under your tongue like this.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.180
Can you see?

39:31.181 --> 39:33.819
Does it look like
I'm holding anything?

39:33.820 --> 39:36.100
See, because I've got
five on this side,

39:36.101 --> 39:38.620
got seven on this side here.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.660
Cos it's all the way back there.

39:43.661 --> 39:47.539
See that? Right, look.

39:47.540 --> 39:49.020
Go on, try it.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.540
At the back, under your tongue.

39:53.541 --> 39:55.060
Way back.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.620
That's it, yeah. Go on.
Way down at the back.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.899
Shit, what the...?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.140

40:07.460 --> 40:09.819
Oi, what's this street called?

40:09.820 --> 40:11.339
Just in case I get lost.

40:11.340 --> 40:12.780

40:31.780 --> 40:33.780

40:43.780 --> 40:46.459
Here you go,

40:46.460 --> 40:50.059
What did you say to Dushane
and dem? You had no right.

40:50.060 --> 40:56.059
What was the deal? You can stay here
as long as you behave yourself.

40:56.060 --> 41:00.459
You're a hypocrite. You were
on the road with my dad, right?

41:00.460 --> 41:02.538
You were in jail with him,
for fuck's sake.

41:02.539 --> 41:04.940
I see you talkin' to Dushane
or Sully or any of them,

41:04.941 --> 41:09.299
I'm calling social services and I'm
telling them you're here on your own.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.618
What? You'd hurt my mum like that?

41:10.619 --> 41:13.100
Don't you think it hurts her more
you hanging with them?

41:13.101 --> 41:15.101
