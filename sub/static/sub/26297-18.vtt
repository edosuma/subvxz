WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.526
ADULT ADAM: The '80s marked the rise of the cooking show.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.963
There was Yan,
The Galloping Gourmet,

00:07.007 --> 00:10.140
the Cajun cook, and,
of course, a Swedish Muppet.

00:10.184 --> 00:13.013
But my mom's lifelong hero
was Julia Child.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.492
I'm Julia Child.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.103
ADULT ADAM: Julia's show,
The French Chef,

00:16.146 --> 00:18.192
was the inspiration
for our family's

00:18.235 --> 00:21.064
deliciously cheesy
"French phase."

00:21.108 --> 00:23.762
BEVERLY: For Erica,
savory Quiche Lorraine.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.895
For Murray,
melty cheese fondue.

00:25.938 --> 00:29.072
It's like nachos
without the hassle.

00:29.116 --> 00:33.120
And for
my hungry bear, potatoes
au gratin, extra gratin.

00:33.163 --> 00:36.123
This is gonna wreck me.
Thanks, Mom.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.689
ADULT ADAM: Julia even
inspired my mom to write

00:37.733 --> 00:39.256
The Beverly Goldberg
Cookbook.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.345
She sent it to
every publisher in town,

00:41.389 --> 00:44.261
confident that she'd take
the cooking world by storm.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.436
Or... Not.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.308
Aw, honey,
what's wrong?

00:47.351 --> 00:48.874
Nothing.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.963
I'm just tearing up 'cause
Julia's chopping an onion.

00:51.007 --> 00:54.097
You do know that
that onion is on TV, right?

00:54.141 --> 00:56.317
Okay, fine!

00:56.360 --> 00:58.014
It's my cookbook.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.103
I sent it out to
some publishers,

01:00.147 --> 01:03.324
and they said I was poop
and that my cooking was poop

01:03.367 --> 01:05.587
and that my
one and only
dream is poop!

01:05.630 --> 01:07.328
No one has
just one dream, Bevy.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.373
I'm sure you got
plenty of others.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.158
Well,
like Barry becomes a doctor,

01:11.201 --> 01:13.812
Erica wins a Grammy,
Adam gets a rare disease

01:13.856 --> 01:15.162
that prevents
his snuggly little body

01:15.205 --> 01:17.381
from developing
into a full adult man.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.036
Bev, none of those dreams
are about you,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.517
and one in particular
is very troubling.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.954
Damn it, I know!
Erica's never gonna
win a Grammy!

01:24.997 --> 01:27.391
Okay, I'm sure it's not
as bad as ya think.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.740
Lemme see that letter.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.438
Take your pick.

01:30.481 --> 01:34.181
"Dear Ms. Goldberg,
your blending of fish and veal

01:34.224 --> 01:37.358
"is both upsetting
and against God's plan."

01:40.187 --> 01:42.276
♪ I'm twisted up inside

01:42.319 --> 01:45.148
♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:48.151 --> 01:49.848
♪ I don't know the future

01:49.892 --> 01:53.504
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

01:53.548 --> 01:55.898
ADULT ADAM:
It was March 13th,
1980-something,

01:55.941 --> 01:58.422
and my brother had
a new concern
about his future.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.512
Listen up. I've got some
deeply upsetting news, JTP.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.993
ALL: JTP!
No! Not the time.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.516
Mr. Glascott just called

02:05.560 --> 02:07.388
an emergency college
meeting with me

02:07.431 --> 02:08.954
by chasing me down the hall.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.304
Oh, no. What's wrong?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.523
Turns out, we all need
recommendation letters

02:12.567 --> 02:14.395
from teachers to
get into college.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.831
And?

02:15.874 --> 02:18.616
Wait, you all knew about this
and didn't tell me?

02:18.660 --> 02:20.009
I tried to tell you,
but you said...

02:20.052 --> 02:22.968
Stop speaking, Matt Bradley!
Yeah, that e-exactly.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.622
Seriously,
you all have 'em?

02:24.666 --> 02:27.190
Definitely to rub it in your
face, but Geoff got 12 reccos.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.888
Twelve? That's almost
a baker's dozen!

02:29.932 --> 02:31.673
Gimme one.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.631
I'll just open it and
change the name from
Geoff to Big Tasty.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.633
ALL: No!
What's the big deal?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.157
Bar, those letters
were written about me.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.419
And they need to be
sent in sealed

02:38.462 --> 02:40.160
so the admissions people
know they're legit.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.683
So, you're saying
I'm going to actually

02:41.726 --> 02:44.207
have to ask a teacher to
write nice stuff about me?

02:44.251 --> 02:45.904
Ha! You're not
going to college.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.471
College-what?
Who said college?

02:47.515 --> 02:48.690
Whoa, where'd he come from?

02:48.733 --> 02:50.605
For a big man,
he moves like a phantom.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.041
Because college is the only
thing that matters to me...

02:52.084 --> 02:53.347
That and the thermostat.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.132
Okay, don't freak out
and call me a moron,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.918
but I've apparently thus far
failed to "obtain"

02:59.962 --> 03:05.359
a "recommendation letter"
from a "teacher" at "school."

03:05.402 --> 03:07.926
Stop with the quotes.
My God, I raised a moron.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.798
You have.
"This is your fault."

03:09.841 --> 03:11.452
ADULT ADAM: Luckily,
our school had

03:11.495 --> 03:12.888
an insanely nice
science teacher

03:12.931 --> 03:14.063
who couldn't say no to anyone.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.412
Dr. Katman?
Down here!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.414
Oh, no!

03:17.458 --> 03:18.894
You're lying on
a bed of nails!

03:18.937 --> 03:21.636
Physics is just so bitchin'!
Am I right?

03:21.679 --> 03:23.333
Wanna try?

03:23.377 --> 03:26.206
Mmm. Well anyway,
I know this is last minute,

03:26.249 --> 03:27.642
but apparently you
gotta have a teacher

03:27.685 --> 03:30.558
write you a college
rec...Aw, buddy!

03:30.601 --> 03:33.474
I am so honored
you asked me.
Truly, man!

03:33.517 --> 03:35.258
Really?
Call me a proton!

03:35.302 --> 03:37.217
That's how positive I am!

03:37.260 --> 03:39.610
Dude, I really
owe you one!Stop.

03:39.654 --> 03:43.092
Just like a neutron,
there's no charge.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.486
And also please
don't put any of
those jokes in my letter.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.531
ADULT ADAM: With that,
Barry's problem was solved.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.621
And after all
my mom's rejection letters,

03:50.665 --> 03:52.971
she turned to her hero,
Julia Child, for answers.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.451
Adam, I need your help.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.975
This is a legitimate,
real emergency.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.760
Oh, my God, what?

03:58.803 --> 04:03.068
I've thought of a super-easy,
foolproof way to sell my book.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.983
I'm gonna do a cooking show
like Julia Child,

04:05.027 --> 04:08.204
and you are gonna
be my director and
my on-camera sidekick.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.423
I didn't follow any of that,

04:09.466 --> 04:11.642
but I'm pretty sure
it's not an emergency.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.428
You know, at first,
the rejection letters
were devastating,

04:14.471 --> 04:17.692
but then I remembered
that Julia didn't become
famous

04:17.735 --> 04:20.303
'til she was 50
and had her own cooking show!

04:20.347 --> 04:22.305
Huh?
That's where you come in.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.654
Or go out
as fast as I can

04:23.698 --> 04:25.221
'cause what you just said
is horrifying.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.658
But this is so
up your alley, Adam.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.573
You're always running around
with a video camera.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.663
Me? Nah, that's like
the opposite of what I do.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.578
You got a camera
in your hand right now.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.319
Good eye!
Good eye.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.799
Thing is,
I was just about to

04:37.842 --> 04:40.410
put this in the garage
'cause making childish movies

04:40.454 --> 04:41.759
just doesn't
appeal to me anymore.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.805
Let's start filming, kiddo.

04:43.848 --> 04:47.417
This karate tortoise outfit
is already making me schvitz.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.202
Okay, fine!
I still make awesome movies!

04:50.246 --> 04:52.814
But I honestly don't know
the first thing about making
a cooking show.

04:52.857 --> 04:56.992
ADAM: It's
The Chadam Cooking Hour:
episode 140!

04:57.035 --> 05:00.822
Okay, fine!
I made six years' worth
of cooking shows!

05:00.865 --> 05:02.476
Doesn't mean
I can help you!

05:02.519 --> 05:04.826
Adam, please.
Be my cooking sidekick.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.306
It's my dream.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.917
Adam, I saw
the rejection letters!

05:08.960 --> 05:10.353
It was too much!

05:10.397 --> 05:13.182
Just help the lady
with her dream!

05:13.225 --> 05:15.576
Even if I wanted to help,
I don't run a TV station.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.186
I'm just a kid
with a camera.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.014
What about public access?

05:19.057 --> 05:21.016
They'll let anyone on there.

05:21.059 --> 05:25.499
I watch this one program
where a lady answers
tax questions in a bikini.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.197
Her information
is definitely wrong,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.721
but I'm a loyal viewer.
BEVERLY: Perfect.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.984
I'm gonna call public access
and verbally harass

05:33.028 --> 05:34.421
the first person
who picks up

05:34.464 --> 05:36.074
and tell them that
we are coming down there!

05:36.118 --> 05:37.815
We're gonna be TV stars!

05:37.859 --> 05:40.731
ADULT ADAM: While I was facing a world of embarrassment,

05:40.775 --> 05:43.647
Barry was ready to rub his recco letter in Erica's face.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.954
Hey, my Caboodle!
Erica's Caboodle!

05:45.997 --> 05:47.477
BARRY: Silence!

05:47.521 --> 05:51.394
In my hand, I hold a glowing
recco from Dr. Katman.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
Oh, man, what a relief!
Yeah.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
Feels good to know
I'm not gonna be

05:55.224 --> 05:58.445
a full-time drain on society
like your miserable
couch sloth of a girlfriend.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.622
Excuse me?
You've worn sweats
for six straight days.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.450
You get it.
Well, I wouldn't be so cocky.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.626
You don't even know what
that teacher wrote about you.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.324
I'm sure it's great.
Dr. Katman's super nice
and also,

06:08.368 --> 06:09.978
he has, like,
the most hilarious
science jokes.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.415
They guy's nice, all right.
If anything, too nice.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.417
The kind of nice
you almost don't trust.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.462
It's like,
"What are you hiding, man?"

06:15.505 --> 06:17.899
It is like he's hiding
something.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.074
Erica, stop.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.728
Don't whip him
into a frenzy

06:20.771 --> 06:23.687
just because
he commented on your
current life situation.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.776
I'm not. I'm just stating
the simple fact

06:25.820 --> 06:27.561
that one single letter
can ruin his life forever.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.214
I gotta see
what's in this letter!

06:29.258 --> 06:30.781
Barry, stop.
You can't look at that.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.392
Wait, I got something.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.871
What's "poosnicken" mean?

06:33.915 --> 06:35.264
Is that good
from an educator?

06:35.307 --> 06:36.483
Doesn't sound good.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.006
Ta.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.529
Couch sloth my ass.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.053
Dude, she's just
messing with you 'cause
she's in a bad place.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.359
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.144
And yet, it's too late.
I assumed.

06:46.188 --> 06:49.191
ADULT ADAM: And so,
Barry broke the sacred code
of the recco letter

06:49.234 --> 06:51.933
using a high-tech method
he learned from watching
Murder, She Wrote.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.022
Oh, crap! It worked!

06:54.065 --> 06:56.590
"It is a great honor
and privilege to give

06:56.633 --> 06:59.549
"Barry Goldberg
my highest recommendation."

06:59.593 --> 07:02.160
Uh, Bar? The steam
is making the ink run!

07:02.204 --> 07:03.771
Don't panic!
We'll just dry it
off with the iron.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.036
Oh, no!
The iron's intense heat
is burning the paper!

07:08.079 --> 07:11.082
Don't panic.
I'll just spray it with
water from this bottle.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.433
Oh, no! The charred
remnants are soaked,

07:13.476 --> 07:15.130
and now the ink's
running even more!

07:15.173 --> 07:16.958
Don't panic!
I'll just hit it
with the iron again!

07:18.525 --> 07:19.743
Let me try to piece it
back together!

07:19.787 --> 07:21.658
Time to panic!
Aah! Aah!

07:21.702 --> 07:23.573
The charred remnants
are burning my hands!

07:23.617 --> 07:25.445
ADULT ADAM: While Barry
destroyed his letter,

07:25.488 --> 07:28.883
my mom was taking a page
from Julia Child
for our first rehearsal.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.015
And action.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.800
Hi, I'm Adam.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.671
Hello! I'm Beverly Goldberg.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.281
Welcome to
The Goldberg Gourmet.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.501
Bon appetit!

07:38.545 --> 07:39.763
And cut.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.984
Okay, I got some
performance notes.

07:43.027 --> 07:46.074
Hit me.
So, you're a human person.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.858
So, you should
talk like one.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.861
And action.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.472
Well, hello!Cut.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.951
Hello!
Cut.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.345
Hello, I'm Beverly Goldberg...
Cut!

07:56.388 --> 08:00.088
Welcome to
The Goldberg Gourmet.
Bon appetit.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.481
And... Cut.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.308
I think
I know what's happening.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.397
Seems whenever I say "action,"

08:05.441 --> 08:08.183
your mom panics
and becomes Julia Child.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.794
Oh,
don't be ridiculous!
Here, I'll prove it.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.536
Say "action"
and watch me cook.Action.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
This lovely dish is made

08:15.582 --> 08:18.193
with saltwater prawns,
Parmesan cheese,

08:18.236 --> 08:20.282
and butter
because butter is better!

08:20.325 --> 08:22.458
I'm Julia Child!
Cut.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.329
Okay, maybe
I am doing a little something.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.809
And I'm doing
a lot of quitting.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.332
Good luck
with your project.Wait, why?

08:27.376 --> 08:29.726
'Cause you're gonna
embarrass me
on public television,

08:29.770 --> 08:30.988
seen by dozens.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.990
And it doesn't matter to you
that this might

08:33.034 --> 08:35.210
actually help
sell my cookbook?No!

08:35.253 --> 08:38.126
'Cause my mom
making a cookbook
is also embarrassing,

08:38.169 --> 08:41.782
and so are your aprons
and weird parm dishes
and everything about you.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.697
It's pure embarrassment,

08:43.740 --> 08:45.960
and you have no idea
what it feels like.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.353
Oh-ho, and you think
I'm never embarrassed by you?

08:48.397 --> 08:50.051
Um, no!

08:50.094 --> 08:52.096
I think you made it
pretty clear you love
everything that I do.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.577
So, you don't think
I'm embarrassed
when I have friends over,

08:54.621 --> 08:57.580
and you do one of your
creepy shows with
a ventriloquist dummy?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.582
You bought us
matching outfits!

08:59.626 --> 09:01.236
And you don't think
I was embarrassed

09:01.279 --> 09:03.934
to watch a three-hour
one-man show

09:03.978 --> 09:06.894
where you played
an eclectic cast
of international characters?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.853
You said my Jamaican accent
was spot-on, mon!

09:09.897 --> 09:11.115
And you don't think
I was embarrassed

09:11.159 --> 09:13.988
to run down to your school
with an extra pair of pants

09:14.031 --> 09:17.252
because of the thing
I promised never to
speak about?

09:18.470 --> 09:20.385
Promise broken!

09:20.429 --> 09:23.475
Baby, you are ten thousand
times more embarrassing
than I will ever be,

09:23.519 --> 09:25.739
but it doesn't matter
because I love you
more than anything!

09:27.262 --> 09:28.698
Clearly, you don't feel
the same way.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.660
And cut!

09:33.703 --> 09:34.704
Come on.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.839
ADULT ADAM: Even
though Barry torched
his college recco,

09:38.882 --> 09:41.450
he knew Doc would be more than happy to write him a new one.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.409
Hey, Doc! Got a sec?
Of course, Goldie!

09:44.453 --> 09:46.281
A little time
for my star student.

09:46.324 --> 09:50.328
But first, let me wet the
ole whistle with some wine.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.287
Oh, you say
this is just water.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.636
I didn't say anything.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.599
A toast to you!

09:59.642 --> 10:00.991
Fun.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.558
So, what's the important news?
I'm excited.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.821
You should be. Remember
that letter you wrote me?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.823
Of course. Your college
recommendation letter.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.695
Yeah, that's the one.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.697
Turns out, I read it
against your wishes

10:10.740 --> 10:12.307
and destroyed it
with fire and water.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.961
But you're gonna write me
a new one

10:14.004 --> 10:16.006
'cause you did say
I'm your star student.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.356
It doesn't feel like that
anymore, pal.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.837
Wow, I'm like
really mad right now.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.360
I understand
why you would be,

10:22.404 --> 10:25.233
but I'm very confused by
your smile and cheery tone.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.538
Well, let me clear it up.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.063
I'm really pissed, and I'm not
gonna write  for you,

10:29.106 --> 10:30.891
because what you did
was really  up.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.197
But I still need
a recco for college.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.547
I'd ask
another teacher, pal.
I wish you all the best.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.071
Uh-oh.
Yeah, uh-oh!

10:37.114 --> 10:39.116
You better go
because I'm saying words

10:39.160 --> 10:40.814
that I never thought
I would say to a child!

10:43.512 --> 10:45.079
Hey, man, you okay?

10:45.122 --> 10:46.950
You've barely touched
your Fruit Roll-Up finger.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.039
Eh. Last night,
I got into it with my mom,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.040
and she
kinda got in my head.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.390
How?

10:52.434 --> 10:53.783
Do you guys think
I'm embarrassing?

10:58.048 --> 11:00.311
Oh, balls! You're all
avoiding eye contact!

11:00.355 --> 11:03.097
Bro, I think it's pretty
well-known that you're...
Unique.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.838
I'd say one of a kind.
Your own man.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.667
Those are just nice ways
of saying I'm super
embarrassing!

11:07.710 --> 11:09.494
What's up?

11:09.538 --> 11:11.932
Adam's mom caved
and finally admitted
the kid's an embarrassment.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.411
Oh, sure.
What?

11:13.455 --> 11:15.718
You're my girlfriend!
You're aware of this, too?

11:15.762 --> 11:18.155
It's endearing.
Aww...

11:18.199 --> 11:20.288
Also...  Aw!

11:20.331 --> 11:23.204
How can my own mother
protect and praise me
with a lifetime of lies?

11:23.247 --> 11:25.206
So, you're saying
she's a bad mom

11:25.249 --> 11:27.861
for accepting the humiliation
you bring her
with grace and kindness?

11:27.904 --> 11:31.038
Yes!
God, I suck!

11:31.081 --> 11:33.649
For the first time ever,
my mom needed me
to support her,

11:33.693 --> 11:35.346
and I flat-out said no.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.131
Well, there has to be some way
you can make it right.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.437
It's obvious!

11:39.481 --> 11:42.223
I'll just co-host a public
access cooking show with her!

11:42.266 --> 11:43.964
Not sure
how obvious that was.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.748
My mom wants to be
the darling of the food world

11:45.792 --> 11:46.923
who sells
millions of cookbooks,

11:46.967 --> 11:50.057
and I will not rest
until it happens!

11:50.100 --> 11:52.276
As I was off to help my mom
with her TV dreams,

11:52.320 --> 11:54.626
Barry was on a mission
for a new recco.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.193
All right,
before I do,

11:56.237 --> 11:57.934
let's just take a look
at some of the work

11:57.978 --> 11:59.283
you did this year
in my class.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.807
What is this?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.199
That's my napkin holder.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.027
And this?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.203
That's a shoe holder,
for the holding of shoes.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.378
What exactly is this?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.989
Bird house.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.382
And where exactly
would a bird live?

12:11.426 --> 12:15.430
On top of it.
Or it could lie down here
or walk around over here.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.694
Thank you for your time.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.000
You were stage crew
for two days

12:20.043 --> 12:21.958
and dropped
a chandelier on my head.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.220
Thank you for your time.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.962
In order to save you
time and energy,

12:26.006 --> 12:28.486
I've written the
recommendation letter myself.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.315
If you could just sign it...
"Barry Goldberg can squat
a baby elephant

12:31.359 --> 12:34.405
"and bench 275 an unlimited
number of times."

12:34.449 --> 12:36.930
Uh-huh. Just right
at the bottom there...

12:36.973 --> 12:39.236
Tell you what,
if you can do one pull up,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.978
I'll sign this letter and walk
it to the college myself.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.899
Thank you for your time.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.859
Well, you can't
just give up.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.731
You need a good recco
to get into...Shh!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.733
Don't say that
word 'cause Dad will hear.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.780
Oh, man, I've sunk
so low that I've stopped
my own brother

13:00.823 --> 13:01.998
from getting into...

13:02.042 --> 13:04.435
No!
I destroyed the letter.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.873
This whole
mess is my fault.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.613
I only convinced you
that Doc wrote you

13:08.657 --> 13:11.355
a bad  recco
'cause I was jealous.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.053
'Cause I'm going to ?

13:13.096 --> 13:14.184
Yes!

13:14.228 --> 13:17.274
You're about to go on
a wild  adventure.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.668
I know I thought
that dropping out
of

13:19.711 --> 13:21.975
was the right move,
but I'm realizing that

13:22.018 --> 13:24.847
I really needed
to grow up a bit.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.545
Look,
I know you're freaking out
about your future,

13:27.589 --> 13:28.895
but if anyone's
gonna be a rock star,

13:28.938 --> 13:29.983
it's my rock star sister.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.289
That means a lot.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.943
I'm sorry I've been
such a jerk.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.292
It's cool.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.207
Everyone stresses out
when it comes to college.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.427
Who said college?
What happened? Tell me!

13:39.470 --> 13:41.864
Okay! Fine! I messed up.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.215
No, I did. I got in
Barry's head and made
him open his recco.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.130
And then he ruined it.
Wait, you know?

13:47.174 --> 13:48.784
Yes!
I found that charred,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.873
damp letter
right where you left it.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.484
Gah! Why didn't Mom
clean that up?

13:53.528 --> 13:54.964
Because you're a dumbass,

13:55.008 --> 13:58.620
which is why I went to Katman
and got you a brand-new recco.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.404
How is this happening?

14:00.448 --> 14:03.755
The man said no
and cursed me out
in the nicest possible way!

14:03.799 --> 14:07.498
Because this man
doesn't take no for an answer
when it comes to college.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.586
But listen to me.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.589
Do not betray your weird,
happy teacher again.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.114
As a matter of fact,
just steer clear
of him forever.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.767
My God, you're actually
super effective

14:15.811 --> 14:17.030
and good at Dad stuff
when you care.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.946
That's on you
for not being interesting.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.600
You gotta promise me
you're gonna go against

14:22.644 --> 14:26.735
all your instincts and not be
a moron who opens this letter.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.564
Can you do that?
Can you not be a moron?

14:29.607 --> 14:33.133
Honestly, that's asking a lot.
It really is, Dad.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.265
ADULT ADAM: As Barry took on
the challenge of a lifetime,

14:35.309 --> 14:37.615
I was ready to give my mom
her lifelong dream.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.660
Oh, Lord.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.358
Oh, Lord in poop.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.751
You know what?
You were right.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.622
This is not gonna help me
sell my cookbook.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.450
All I'm gonna do
is make a fool of myself.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.278
Mom! Look at me.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.542
You're in my world now,
the AV world.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.935
This is where I shine.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.676
So you just have to
follow my lead,

14:54.719 --> 14:56.199
and I'll make you look good.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.288
Okay, I am so confused.
You said...

14:58.332 --> 15:00.334
I know what I said,
and I was wrong.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.901
You've always been there
to support me

15:01.944 --> 15:04.555
with your love and kindness
and new pants.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.818
And now it's my turn
to support you.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.343
So take my hand
and let's go be
on a TV station

15:09.386 --> 15:10.779
that legally has to let
anyone on.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.697
Preheat that oven.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.742
It's parmin' time.

15:17.786 --> 15:21.355
ADULT ADAM: Oh, yeah. Years of making my own movies had led to this moment.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.879
And rolling.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.404
Hi, I'm Adam...
Ooh, boy.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.319
In that moment,
I discovered

15:29.363 --> 15:31.365
that when I go in front
of an actual TV camera,

15:31.408 --> 15:34.194
I freeze up
with crippling stage fright.

15:34.237 --> 15:37.023
It's true, my body
literally shuts down.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.677
Okay...

15:39.721 --> 15:40.896
Guess that's my cue.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.767
Hi.
Hello and welcome.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.379
I'm Beverly Goldberg,
and this is my little
sous-chef, Adam.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.685
Adam, say hello
to the viewers.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.513
Adam.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.386
Me.
Now, the secret to
shredding mozzarella

15:52.429 --> 15:54.997
is to put the block of cheese
in the freezer first.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.956
Sous-chef Adam,
the grater, please.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.220
My hands are numb.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.613
Over the teeth
and through the gums,

16:02.657 --> 16:04.920
look out, tummy,
here it comes.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.053
Hoooo!

16:07.096 --> 16:10.056
Whoooo is excited
about my shrimp parm?

16:10.099 --> 16:11.579
Well, I sure as heck am.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.060
Five stars, Mama.
Oh...

16:14.103 --> 16:16.976
You can find this parm
and many more parms like it

16:17.019 --> 16:18.847
in The Beverly Goldberg
Cookbook.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.544
I'm passing out.

16:20.588 --> 16:23.939
That's right. Coming soon
to book retailers near you.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.201
I'm passing out.
What?

16:25.245 --> 16:26.463
I'm passing out.

16:26.507 --> 16:27.725
Do you want to sit down
or something?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.205
I'm gone! I'm gone.
I'm down.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.861
I'm Beverly Goldberg,
thank you, and good night.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.558
Mama's...
Mama's here, schmoo!

16:36.082 --> 16:37.561
ADULT ADAM:
With my dad's help,

16:37.605 --> 16:39.868
Barry got a new
college recco from Doc,
or so he thought.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.522
Hey, Goldie.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.741
Listen, I didn't
sleep all night after
I unloaded on you.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.221
Not my best me.

16:45.265 --> 16:48.311
No, I deserved that surprising
barrage of potty language.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.922
Look, I know how important
that letter is to you,

16:50.966 --> 16:52.228
so I wrote you another one.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.404
You wrote a third letter?
Third?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.406
Buddy, this is
the second one
right here.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.931
No,
this is the second letter.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.585
You gave it to my dad
yesterday.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.848
He may have given it to you,
but I didn't give it to him.

17:03.892 --> 17:07.200
Wait!
That's why my dad told me
not to talk to you!

17:07.243 --> 17:08.636
He didn't want us
to figure this out.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.638
Figure what out?
What the hell is in
that envelope, pal?

17:10.681 --> 17:11.900
God only knows!

17:11.943 --> 17:13.423
We gotta open that letter.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.122
But what about trust and all
that stuff you got mad about?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.558
I've never been
on this side of it before!

17:17.601 --> 17:19.734
It is really
eating away at me, buddy!

17:19.777 --> 17:22.780
Me too!
But how do we open this
letter without ruining it?

17:22.824 --> 17:25.087
With the answer
to everything.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.307
Science!

17:27.350 --> 17:29.744
ADULT ADAM: That day,
my brother set off to solve
the mystery of a lifetime,

17:29.787 --> 17:30.919
and that night,

17:30.962 --> 17:32.703
I was reliving the
embarrassment of a lifetime.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.966
I'm down.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.579
Hey, pickle, maybe you should
just watch The A Teaminstead?

17:38.622 --> 17:41.973
I just wanted to see
if my on-camera debut
was as bad as I thought.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.454
And it's worse.

17:44.498 --> 17:47.240
No. You were adorable.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.111
You don't have to
do that, Mom.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.721
I just really
wanted to help you.

17:52.419 --> 17:56.684
Listen, lovebug,
you putting yourself
out there to support me,

17:56.727 --> 17:59.556
it helped me more
than you could ever know.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.429
Come on, I just ended up
embarrassing you again.

18:02.472 --> 18:06.389
Adam, I love every
embarrassing thing
about you.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.217
It's what makes you
the most special,

18:08.261 --> 18:10.567
brilliant boy
anyone could ever ask for.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.659
Well, if this cookbook thing
doesn't pan out,

18:15.703 --> 18:18.358
at least we learned you're
shockingly awesome on camera.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.055
Forget TV.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.973

it's important to always
