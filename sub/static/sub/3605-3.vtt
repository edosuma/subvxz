I put my job ahead of
my family,

for dinner and a strange man
is answering my wife's phone.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.029

18:52.299 --> 18:57.589
That she became an artist.
That she has a daughter
named Francoise.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.921
Do you ever wonder
if maybe she didn't
run away?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.306
To be perfectly honest,
there was a time
when I thought

19:04.394 --> 19:06.385
maybe you knew more
than you were saying.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.470
After all, we were
away that weekend,

19:08.565 --> 19:10.521
but you were in town,
Nathan.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.647
And I knew that
you and Kelly had been
seeing each other.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.732
I never told your mother,
but I hired
a private investigator.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.655
Turns out,
you're in the clear.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.909
Kelly, in fact,
used her credit card

19:27.000 --> 19:30.208
to buy a one-way ticket
to London Heathrow,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.210
where she claimed
her checked baggage.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.880
And no one has
seen or heard
from her since.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.255
You think it's possible
something else might
have happened, Millie?

19:39.346 --> 19:42.463
Trust me.
I've been over this
ad nauseum.

19:43.475 --> 19:47.764
Kelly was willful
and spiteful
and full of herself.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.303
(LAUGHS)

19:49.397 --> 19:54.687
Add to that,
me not being the most
attentive of mothers,

19:56.029 --> 19:57.940
no wonder she ran off.

20:02.410 --> 20:06.323
I've got a hair, nail
and body-sculpting thing
and I don't want to be late.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.494
I understand.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.822
So, you'll show
yourself out?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.407
Of course.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.602
Here you go.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.191
Broke out
the good stuff.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.147
(LAUGHS) I've already
had too much.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.655
And my mom
would kill me
if she found out.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.986
There's no way
she'll find out.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.787
You're right.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.866
You know,
my folks won't be back
until Monday.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.710
Is that an invitation?

20:55.797 --> 20:56.752
Do you want it to be?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.296
I don't know.
You've been drinking.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.248
I wouldn't want
to take advantage.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.758
Don't be such a prude.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.973
You want it, Nathan?
Come and get it.

21:27.245 --> 21:30.362
Come on, Nathan.
Come and get it.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.242
You better give me that.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.539
Come and get it.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.162
Give me that.
(LAUGHS) No. Whoa!

21:45.096 --> 21:46.176
No!

21:53.646 --> 21:55.637
You wanted to see me?

21:56.274 --> 21:58.856
Millie called.
Chardonnay.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.528
She said you came to her
asking questions about Kelly.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.191
Do you have any idea
what your trip
down memory lane

22:07.285 --> 22:09.992
is doing to
that poor woman?
Thank you.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.496
Kelly didn't disappear.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.950
She died.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.375
l was there.
What I want to know is why
I can't remember anything.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.916
How would I know?

22:27.722 --> 22:29.758
Because every time
there's a secret
buried some place

22:29.849 --> 22:32.135
I find you with a shovel
behind your back.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.344
You should write
Mother's Day cards.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.178
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this,
one way or the other.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.389
So you can tell me or...

22:40.652 --> 22:41.937
Fine. I took care of it.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.738
And you don't need
to know the details.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.275
You made sure
I wouldn't remember
anything, didn't you?

22:51.704 --> 22:55.413
You were drunk and foolish.
So, yes, I took care of it.
All of it.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.742
I had the Haitian
wipe your memory.
I disposed of her body.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.372
I bought the plane ticket
to London...

23:00.463 --> 23:01.703
It was an accident, Mom.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.663
Well, it didn't look
like one, dear.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.295
So what would you
have me do?

23:07.762 --> 23:10.549
Her death would have
ruined your life.

23:14.227 --> 23:18.186
I'm just waiting for the part
that makes any of this okay.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.686
I made a choice
to protect my son.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.067
You want to vilify me
for that, fine.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.361
I've been vilified
for so much less,

23:27.448 --> 23:31.612
but, please, Nathan,
don't destroy yourself
over this.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.034
So, what?
You're gonna have
your old friend Millie

23:34.122 --> 23:35.612
go on believing that
her daughter ran away

23:35.707 --> 23:38.414
because she was
a bad mother?

23:38.501 --> 23:42.164
Yes. Millie has made
her peace with this.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.255
| suggest you do the same.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.258
I'll be in touch.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.679
MlLLlE: Did you
forget something?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.886
There's something
I need to tell you, Millie.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.767
And I'm not sure
how to do it.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.849
You all right, Nathan?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.940
Look, I can't tell you
how I know this

24:08.948 --> 24:10.939
when I'm not really sure
I should.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.023
What are you
talking about?

24:13.786 --> 24:14.775
Justsayit

24:15.121 --> 24:18.204
Kelly didn't run away.
She died.

24:19.751 --> 24:22.538
And lwas there.
It was an accident.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.040
And it was my fault.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.632
She got on a plane.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.879
There's no plane ticket.
She died, Millie.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.714
And the whole thing
was covered up
by my family.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.802
What kind of twisted,
pathetic game
are you playing?

24:39.896 --> 24:43.138
I'm just trying to tell you
the truth, for once.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.606
I think you should leave.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.275
Please. Go.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.834
I'm sorry.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.010
So, you never answered
the question.

25:39.497 --> 25:40.953
Oh. I don't know.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.578
It's just, you know,

you look back on your life

it hasn't amounted
to much.

talking about?

25:48.798 --> 25:51.961

about trying to help people.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.009
Has it?
Because all | see is pain.

locked them up,

actually helping anybody.

Why would I need
to see Bennet?

38:58.337 --> 39:00.498
He retired.
He's no longer
interested in us.

39:04.301 --> 39:06.838
He may have
changed his mind.

39:34.873 --> 39:39.207
Nathan seemed
very confused.

39:40.337 --> 39:43.170
Wanted to make sure
I heard his side
of the story.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.424
It was upsetting,
to say the least.

39:47.511 --> 39:50.048
Well, Nathan has
always been
overly theatrical.

39:50.138 --> 39:54.598
You know, I'm sure
that's why he's drawn
to the spotlight of politics.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.597
What exactly did he say?

39:58.605 --> 40:00.436
lfeel so silly
telling you this.

40:00.691 --> 40:03.603
No, please, he’s my son.
/ want to know.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.401
He said that
Kelly was dead.

40:06.488 --> 40:09.571
That he was with her
when she died.

40:09.658 --> 40:11.649
(LAUGHS)
/ told him, "No.

40:11.743 --> 40:15.861
"She bought a ticket,
got on a plane
and never looked back. "

40:15.956 --> 40:19.995
Millie, lam so sorry
that he bothered you
with this.

40:20.711 --> 40:24.750
Nathan...
Nathan just hasn't
been himself lately.

40:27.217 --> 40:30.175
You know how much
I've always cared
for Nathan.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.674
I apologize
for his behavior.

40:33.682 --> 40:37.300
No one should have
to go through
that pain twice.

40:38.520 --> 40:42.763
/ can honestly say,
I don’t care anymore.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.767
ljust hope Kelly's happy.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.573
I think that's about
as close to closure
as I'm ever going to get.

40:55.704 --> 40:56.693
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:56.788 --> 40:59.200
Would you excuse me
just one second?

40:59.291 --> 41:00.280
Hello?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.912
Package is delivered.

41:03.754 --> 41:06.211
Wonderful.
Thank you so much.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.206
Something important?

41:10.719 --> 41:11.708
Not at all.

41:11.803 --> 41:12.963
Good.

41:14.681 --> 41:15.921
Where were we?

41:16.516 --> 41:17.505
Closure.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.683
Of course. To closure.

41:20.312 --> 41:21.848
To closure.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.376
