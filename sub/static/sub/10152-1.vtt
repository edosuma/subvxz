01:51.744 --> 01:53.812
- Bang bang, bang bang!

02:41.895 --> 02:44.763
Bang bang!

02:44.765 --> 02:46.498
Ferris, you're
supposed to be dead!

02:46.500 --> 02:48.667
- Hey hey, Jamison, Ferris.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.470
Come on boys, take
it easy, would you?

02:51.472 --> 02:52.871
- He's being stupid!

02:52.873 --> 02:54.306
- Hey!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.175
What did I tell you
about using that word?

02:56.177 --> 03:00.479
We don't call each other
names in this family, do we?

03:00.481 --> 03:01.280
- No sir.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.381
- All right.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.615
- You're supposed
to say special.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.816
- Now play nice together

03:04.818 --> 03:06.752
or you're not gonna
play together at all.

03:07.887 --> 03:08.820
- Yes sir.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.256
All right, let's play fair.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.259
- Okay but when I shoot
you, you go down like this.

03:14.261 --> 03:14.860
Bang bang!

03:14.862 --> 03:17.196
- Oh, you got me.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.530
- Hooray!

03:19.332 --> 03:20.933
- Who wants iced tea?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.968
- I'm thirsty, let's go kids!

03:22.970 --> 03:24.436
Come on.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.762
Jamison where's your brother?

03:50.764 --> 03:51.830
- I don't know.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.465
- He was right here.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.267
- He went that way.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.903
- Ferris!

04:04.377 --> 04:05.544
Ferris?

04:07.380 --> 04:08.513
Ferris!

04:19.926 --> 04:21.392
Ferris!

04:27.033 --> 04:28.467
Ferris, wait!

04:28.469 --> 04:29.534
Wait!

04:32.772 --> 04:33.972
Ferris!

04:44.684 --> 04:46.785
- Hey, you're on
private property.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.487
Hands where I can see them.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.554
- He's got a gun!

04:50.791 --> 04:52.424
- Ferris, no!

04:55.862 --> 04:56.895
No!

05:39.372 --> 05:40.939
- Yeah well, I've had
enough wild nights

05:40.941 --> 05:42.741
to last me a few lifetimes.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.943
And they'll be around
for three or four more,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.345
you know what I mean?

05:46.347 --> 05:47.579
- I think I do.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.481
- Not yet, sweetie.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.018
Look, when I started this band
it was all about the music.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.821
Now it seems to be
just one huge party

05:55.823 --> 05:57.989
sort of blended together.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.660
You doing anything tonight?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.562
- Um, I don't know.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.933
- Well, have you
seen my trailer?

06:07.935 --> 06:10.001
- We're just warming
them up for you.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.140
- Um Trent, we
need you on stage.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.541
Now.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.444
- All right, sorry
to spoil the party.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.379
Got a date.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.747
- Well thank you very much.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.749
Oh.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.651
I'm Gina Alexander.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.021
All right guys that's a wrap.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.490
Start loading the gear.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.557
Trent!

06:34.494 --> 06:35.994
- Is she serious?

06:36.696 --> 06:37.829
- Asshole.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.665
The accent was definitely fake.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.901
- He's really from
Australia, I Googled it.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.770
- Well his accent's still fake.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.605
- Hey, Collin, Mitch, wait up.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.006
- Oh, Trent.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.908
Oh I love your accent!

06:49.910 --> 06:54.179
Let's go to Vegas and elope,
you big Australian man.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.515
- I can't believe that you
guys are actually jealous.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.682
- Yeah right.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.684
- Hey Collin, can I take a look?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.952
Thanks.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.821
- My favorite interview
was Concrete Dumptruck.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.456
That guy was sick.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.591
- Yeah I wanna know who names
their kid Concrete Dumptruck.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.193
They should be in prison.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.197
- Hey, when you dumped
the footage on the drive

07:12.199 --> 07:14.065
did you look through
the other interviews?

07:14.067 --> 07:19.204
You were gonna do it, you
said you wanted to take notes.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.106
- Yeah.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.508
- But, um.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.145
Oh my God.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.947
My entire film.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.016
- What are you talking about?

07:31.018 --> 07:34.219
- Everything except the
interview with Trent is gone.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.221
- No, let me see this.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.824
- Oh I am so screwed.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.566
- Uh, it's not a big deal.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.468
We can go back and reshoot it.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.869
- No, they all left.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.704
This is the last show.

07:57.844 --> 07:58.777
- Hi there folks.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.911
I'm here live on the scene

07:59.913 --> 08:02.180
of Gina Alexander's
rock documentary,

08:02.182 --> 08:03.782
where she has managed to delete

08:03.784 --> 08:06.117
almost her entire
footage, every interview.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.186
Gina, tell us how you feel.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.189
Yeah, okay, there
you have it folks.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.924
Another great moment brought
to you by Mitchell J. Pretti,

08:12.926 --> 08:15.166
you can catch more
of my highlights on
my YouTube channel.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.591
- You're Connor's boy, right?

08:46.993 --> 08:48.760
- You from Saxlow?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.230
- Where's your father?

08:57.003 --> 09:00.171
You know he tried to blow up
one of our trucks last week.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.807
Everybody says he's gone crazy.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.678
- Leave us alone.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.916
- We're gonna take this property
one way or another, boy.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.120
I'll turn this whole
town against you!

09:32.104 --> 09:33.738
Donald Connors.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.878
- I think we need to talk.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.323
- I needed that
footage to graduate.

09:51.325 --> 09:55.927
It was only like 10 or 12 of
some of the coolest interviews

09:55.929 --> 09:58.730
of some of the most awesome
bands still alive today.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.931
- Mitch.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.270
- Hey, Gina, don't
feel bad about it okay?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.672
I remember when I was 12,
I lost all my footage.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.640
- Will you just shut up?

10:08.642 --> 10:09.642
- Seriously.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.076
- Enough.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.813
- Awkward.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.649
What mile marker are we at?

10:17.651 --> 10:21.953
- Get off at the next exit, we
can stay at my mom's tonight.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.355
- No, I just wanna
get back okay?

10:23.357 --> 10:25.624
- We're all exhausted,
and I'm starving.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.292
I know a great pub up ahead.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.894
- I'm not hungry.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.830
- Then have a drink.

10:34.734 --> 10:35.800
- Yeah.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.636
- Yeah!

10:37.638 --> 10:40.071
- Welcome to Kern County.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.008
Home of, nothing.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.059
Hey, 10 bucks says the average
sum total of front teeth

11:01.061 --> 11:02.761
in this bar is two point five.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.829
- Dude, this isn't Virginia.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.999
- Just saying.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.101
- All right, let's do this.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.071
- Come on Gina, turn
that frown upside down.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.839
We're getting drunk.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.411
- First round on me.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.446
- IDs?

11:25.818 --> 11:26.885
- Thanks.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.322
- Hold on big guy.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.724
This you?

11:32.726 --> 11:33.458
- Yeah.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.427
- Sure don't look like you.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.828
- I get that a lot.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.463
War changes a man.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.742
- Vietnam?

11:55.214 --> 11:58.416
Okay, maybe we are in Virginia.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.020
Seriously?

12:04.924 --> 12:06.024
- Come on.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.159
- Here.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.360
- Thank you.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.441
In Virginia, if I
divorce my wife,

12:23.443 --> 12:26.511
is she still my mom
or am I an orphan?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.884
Being an orphan must suck.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.486
- Dammit Mitch.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.121
- What?

12:36.956 --> 12:40.024
- I'm gonna go clean off
some of the past 10 hours.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.127
- What?

12:42.995 --> 12:44.529
- She's an orphan.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.798
And you are an idiot.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.868
- How did I not know this?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.503
I've known her
longer than you have.

12:51.505 --> 12:55.206
- Maybe you should talk less
and listen a little more.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.547
- Donald!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.951
- Do you know who belongs
to that black SUV?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.520
- They just came in.

13:14.827 --> 13:15.827
- So where'd you take her?

13:15.829 --> 13:16.961
- I took her to Hardee's.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.429
- That girl lets you
take her anywhere.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.098
How long you guys
been going out?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.032
- Four days?

13:21.034 --> 13:22.333
- That's a record for you.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.434
- It is.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.103
- How've you been Mr. Connors?

13:25.105 --> 13:27.172
I haven't seen you in a while.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.974
- Whisky, bourbon.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.044
- Okay.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.582
- So it would have
been a crime not to.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.318
When they came over,
and it was like...

13:41.921 --> 13:42.921
- Wow.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.990
- I look stupid.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.493
- No, you look great.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.363
- Finish your story.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.232
- No no, it was stupid.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.234
Just, it was dumb.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.335
- Wow.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.237
Mitch Pretti.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.506
If I had only known makeup was
all it took to shut you up,

14:01.508 --> 14:03.241
I would have worn it years ago.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.343
- No you wouldn't have.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.078
- What?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.013
- Nothing.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.116
Guys, can we get the check?

14:12.118 --> 14:14.485
These guys are creeping me out.

14:14.487 --> 14:18.523
- But you, you're the one
that wanted to come here.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.124
- Yeah, I know.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.926
I'll be in the car.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.196
- Really?

14:27.299 --> 14:31.135
- So, two brews
and a pina colada.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.040
- This was his.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.542
- Yeah, right.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.219
- It's been a while, Connors.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.190
Hear you're still holding out.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.494
Look, Donald.

14:57.296 --> 15:00.198
Saxlow was willing to push
her offer up to $600,000.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.201
They won't buy any of us
out until you sign on.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.336
- Not my problem.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.975
- Dammit Donald, you're not
the only one affected by this.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.544
The bank's about
to take my house.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.982
Pete, he hasn't worked
in seven months.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.652
- They killed my son, John.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.423
You think they should
have my land too?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.161
- It was an accident.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.130
It was just an accident.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.265
Do yourself and
your family a favor

15:34.267 --> 15:35.600
and take the money.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.635
You can start over.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.539
- Did they put you up to this?

15:43.409 --> 15:46.144
- I've never seen 'em
before in my life.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.254
Hey, it's been 10 years, Donald.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.588
Just move on.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.092
- Could you move on
if it was your son?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.161
And you see his
killers every day?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.329
Could you?

16:16.308 --> 16:17.709
- What just happened?

16:19.211 --> 16:21.279
- Probably just
fighting over you.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.647
- Shut up.

16:23.282 --> 16:26.451
- Let's finish these
beers and get out of here.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.052
All right, cheers.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.689
Do you remember what happened
last time I was here?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.290
- You mean when my mom started

17:06.291 --> 17:07.724
playing her Joni
Mitchell records

17:07.727 --> 17:09.694
and telling us stories
about LA in the '70s

17:09.695 --> 17:11.529
while forcing you to
model my dad's old clothes

17:11.531 --> 17:12.530
around the living room?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.564
- Yeah.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.032
Let's not do that again.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.467
- I'll do my best.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.637
- Coming!

17:25.244 --> 17:26.411
Oh, Mitch!

17:26.413 --> 17:27.412
- Hi Mom.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.780
- What are you doing here?

17:28.782 --> 17:30.148
Come in, come in.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.151
So happy to see you, hi, hi.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.120
- Hey, you remember
Collin, right?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.723
- Of course I do,
how could I forget?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.559
You look just like
my ex-husband Morty.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.693
Good to see you.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.663
And you must be Gina.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.267
Mitch tells me that
you are making a movie.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.268
- We were.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.636
- We are.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.807
- So guess what guys,
I'm so happy you're here.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.608
I have The Princess Diaries.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.079
- Actually Mom, we're just
hoping to crash for the night.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.582
- Mitch, are you sure your
friends don't wanna play Boggle?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.352
And if not, I have those
Joni Mitchell records.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.088
Do you remember this?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.423
- Oh, I remember.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.292
- It's been a long
day, really long day.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.860
We'll catch up in
the morning, okay?

18:15.862 --> 18:19.464
- Oh okay, my sweet, sweet boy.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.431
- Thanks Mom.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.833
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.767
- Me too.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.236
- Okay, let me take your bags.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.306
Everything's upstairs
that you'll need.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.574
- Come on guys!

18:29.576 --> 18:30.708
- Goodnight.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.177
- Goodnight, so
nice to meet you.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.416
Are you sure that you guys don't
want some milk and cookies?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.717
- We're fine Mom.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.651
- Okay.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.719
But I do have Ben & Jerry's.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.553
- Mom!

18:42.555 --> 18:43.654
- Okay.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.492
I'm glad you're here, sweetie.

18:49.428 --> 18:50.828
- You guys, sorry about my mom.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.763
It's amazing she
survived the '70s.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.332
- I love your mom.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.170
That's so cute.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.346
I didn't realize you had such
a crush on Richard Greico.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.648
- Yeah, it was
kind of a big deal.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.453
- Exactly the same.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.654
It's weird.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.523
- Guys, don't touch
anything, okay?

19:18.525 --> 19:19.790
Just, nothing.

19:20.692 --> 19:21.759
- Karaoke?

19:21.761 --> 19:23.661
- Yeah my mom made me do that.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.496
- There's seven of them.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.298
- Yeah.

19:27.799 --> 19:28.799
- Seven.

19:28.801 --> 19:29.734
- Mhm.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.702
- Why don't you do some for us?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.305
- No, no guys, I'm gonna
go get ready for bed.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.473
- Come on, Danny in Grease.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.709
- You sleep in my room, I'm
gonna sleep in the guest room.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.844
- Funny boy, come on.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.445
- Look guys, it's
not funny, okay?

19:41.447 --> 19:45.483
- Camera out of the face,
this isn't TMZ, goodnight.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.884
- We were only teasing.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.553
- He's sensitive.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.862
I will sleep on the floor.

19:59.565 --> 20:00.531
- Okay.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.233
- I'll take that.

20:33.765 --> 20:34.799
- Hey.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.375
You awake?

20:48.513 --> 20:50.448
- Now I am.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.517
What's up?

20:54.386 --> 20:55.920
- I can't sleep.

20:59.391 --> 21:02.026
- Think about The Notebook.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.730
- Shut up, that's
my favorite movie.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.298
- Yeah, I know.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.870
- You can come up
here if you want.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.806
The floor must not
be that comfortable.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.408
- Why?

21:17.410 --> 21:19.877
So you can take advantage of me?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.946
- Fine, stay down there.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.784
- Shh, I'm trying to
think about The Notebook.

21:53.545 --> 21:56.981
So this is what a
mattress feels like.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.689
What's wrong?

22:05.924 --> 22:08.726
You still thinking
about the footage?

22:12.431 --> 22:14.532
- It's a frikkin' disaster.

22:17.436 --> 22:20.771
- You don't think Steven
Spielberg ever made mistakes?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.343
Look, when we get back to LA,

22:25.345 --> 22:28.679
I will help you shoot that
other project you wanted to do.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.750
- You're really sweet to me.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.452
- Shh, whoa.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.955
I don't wanna ruin my
bad boy image, you know?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.557
People talk.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.075
Sorry.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.079
- I, uh...

24:58.563 --> 25:00.698
- What the fuck have you done?

25:01.633 --> 25:03.033
- 10 years now.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.772
10 years I've been telling
you people to stay away,

25:08.774 --> 25:10.774
but you keep coming back.

25:11.109 --> 25:14.044
You fucking murdered my son!

25:14.279 --> 25:17.982
You keep harassing my family.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.518
You know, there comes a time

25:20.520 --> 25:23.053
when a man can't
take it anymore.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.823
When a man is no
longer responsible

25:25.825 --> 25:29.560
for his actions to
protect what's his.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.929
A man has his limits!

25:34.165 --> 25:37.301
- Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.239
You're already dead.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.275
Now you untie me now,

25:47.078 --> 25:48.812
or they'll just keep
sending more people

25:48.814 --> 25:51.215
until your entire
family is dead.

25:51.816 --> 25:54.018
- Why are you doing this to us?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.253
What did we do to you?

25:59.157 --> 26:01.825
- You think it was
something you did?

26:01.827 --> 26:06.096
You're not even a
blip on our radar.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.966
You're nothing!

26:11.069 --> 26:12.069
You hear me?

26:12.071 --> 26:13.737
You're nothing.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.706
You're just in the way!

26:15.708 --> 26:18.576
- My son wasn't nothing!

26:25.650 --> 26:27.117
- Sooner or later,

26:30.188 --> 26:33.290
we're not even gonna
have to do anything!

26:33.292 --> 26:35.759
The whole town has
turned against you.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.694
- Fuck you.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.828
- Fuck you!

26:37.830 --> 26:40.798
- No, no, fuck you.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.368
You miserable bastard, fuck you!

26:44.370 --> 26:46.136
He was my son,

26:46.138 --> 26:50.140
and you shot him
down like a dog!

26:55.780 --> 26:57.181
You know,

26:58.984 --> 27:01.619
the good book says

27:02.921 --> 27:04.855
an eye for an eye.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.124
But you and I,

27:08.693 --> 27:11.662
we're gonna start with a hand.

27:20.872 --> 27:23.073
- My mom has one of the
best-kept plant collections

27:23.075 --> 27:24.274
in Southern California.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.876
- Well that is a stretch.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.378
Kern County, definitely.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.049
Now listen, I know your
diet is terrible at school,

27:32.051 --> 27:35.819
so while I have you here,
you are going to eat.

27:38.123 --> 27:41.892
- Why do you use bottled
water on your plants?

27:42.961 --> 27:44.194
- Habit, I guess.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.363
- Doesn't that get expensive?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.799
- Well, with all the
contamination from the fracking,

27:48.801 --> 27:49.933
I'd rather spend the money.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.368
- What contamination?

27:51.370 --> 27:54.405
- See, we have veins of Shell
gas and oil beneath the town.

27:54.407 --> 27:57.808
And Mitch was just a
teenager when Saxlow came in

27:57.810 --> 27:59.810
and started fracking the ground.

27:59.812 --> 28:03.247
Problem was, it caused
severe environmental damage,

28:03.249 --> 28:06.684
and that included contamination
to our water supply.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.752
They began buying
up all the property

28:08.754 --> 28:10.954
and trying to get everybody
out before they could be sued.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.057
- Are they trying
to buy you out too?

28:13.059 --> 28:16.160
I mean, they haven't found
any poisons here, yet.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.997
So I just do the bottled water
as a precautionary measure.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.099
But, you know, the other people,

28:22.101 --> 28:24.868
their water, undrinkable.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.037
They say it is so poisonous

28:27.039 --> 28:29.907
that it can cause damage to
your central nervous system,

28:29.909 --> 28:32.076
make you paranoid and crazy.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.877
- I don't know much about that.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.047
- Too focused on Richard
Greico and karaoke, huh?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.950
- I hate you so much right now.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.455
- So there were
protests as well,

28:44.457 --> 28:46.156
and some turned violent.

28:46.158 --> 28:49.026
There was even a young boy
who they accidentally shot,

28:49.028 --> 28:51.795
and they used that as a
platform to end the violence,

28:51.797 --> 28:55.365
but, oh, this is a poor town.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.401
And so, after a while,

28:57.403 --> 29:00.337
people saw the money
that they were offering

29:00.339 --> 29:02.473
as some sort of savior.

29:02.475 --> 29:06.443
So money made people forget
that they killed that young boy.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.813
- How could they get away
with something like that?

29:09.815 --> 29:10.781
- I'll tell you how.

29:10.783 --> 29:14.151
A lot of reporters and
lawyers came into town,

29:14.153 --> 29:16.320
and they started
asking questions.

29:16.322 --> 29:20.858
Saxlow spent millions of
dollars cleaning up their mess.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.263
But you know, in court, it's
not who's right who wins,

29:26.265 --> 29:28.065
it's who has the most money.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.900
- Where did the shooting happen?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.835
- Oh, just up the
hill right here!

29:31.837 --> 29:35.305
I think there's part of an old
bunker or something up there.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.441
No one's been up there in years.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.809
But you know what?

29:38.811 --> 29:42.079
Someone should make
a movie about that.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.117
- What?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.787
- You wanna graduate, don't you?

29:52.390 --> 29:53.323
- No.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.958
No way, are you kidding me?

29:54.960 --> 29:55.993
- This is it.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.461
- I agree, this is it.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.396
- It's a good idea, right?

30:00.999 --> 30:02.933
- Thanks, Mrs. Pretti.

30:03.101 --> 30:04.168
- Okay, everybody eat.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.435
I'm excited, go.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.021
- I'm sorry.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.102
- You're such a gentlewoman.

31:15.975 --> 31:19.176
- What happened to
helping me shoot a new film?

31:20.044 --> 31:21.245
- Didn't mean today.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.279
- Guys.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.316
- What is that?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.085
- Is that blood?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.654
- I think it says something.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.323
I sav yav?

31:33.325 --> 31:35.492
- It says I saw you.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.597
- Do you think it was
that guy from last night?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.165
- Oh my God.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.301
We should go to the police.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.039
Mitch, what are you doing?

31:49.041 --> 31:50.908
That's disgusting!

31:58.583 --> 32:00.117
- It's corn syrup!

32:01.119 --> 32:01.985
- Asshole.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.186
- It was a joke!

32:03.188 --> 32:04.254
- Load the gear.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.390
We're leaving, Mitch.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.058
- Clean it off.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.928
- No sense of humor.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.700
- Careful with the camera.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.568
- Hope there's nothing
expensive in there.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.080
Let's go.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.250
Oh shit.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.419
- Your mom is so cute.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.954
I love her.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.056
- Hey, she wants
to come with us.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.292
- Sandwiches and waters.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.460
- Mom, we're fine.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.394
- No, you're gonna
be starving later.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.429
Please take it, thank you.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.396
- Thanks Mrs. Pretti.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.564
- Oh you're welcome.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.266
Oh, so happy to see you.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.434
- Bye Mom!

32:50.436 --> 32:52.402
- So happy happy happy.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.670
- Drive, please.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.672
- Love you, you be safe okay?

32:55.674 --> 32:56.540
- We will.

32:56.542 --> 32:57.441
- You guys be safe okay?

32:57.443 --> 32:58.742
- Okay, bye!

33:00.545 --> 33:02.012
- Love you!

33:03.314 --> 33:05.282
- Lord have mercy on that woman.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.684
She's gonna be the end of me.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.163
Yeah, looks like we're
gonna be walking from here.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.033
- You realize if we
go past this point,

33:23.035 --> 33:24.468
it's illegal.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.438
- No more than
killing a little boy.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.610
I think this road should
take us right to it.

33:34.312 --> 33:35.178
- Yeah.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.747
Why not, let's go.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.170
- You guys sure you got it all?

34:00.172 --> 34:01.371
- Yes your highness.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.074
- Let's go.

34:06.611 --> 34:09.246
- My prison name
will be C killer.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.415
You know the good news is that

34:11.417 --> 34:14.451
here we can still get our
degrees on the inside, so.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.553
- Will you guys just come on?

34:29.167 --> 34:30.333
- Hey.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.103
Did I do something
to make you angry?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.105
- We should get a move on.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.476
- Wait, check that out.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.545
- Come on Mitch, it's
getting old dude.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.813
- No, seriously.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.284
Yes!

34:50.254 --> 34:51.487
All right.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.224
- This place is crazy.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.492
- Get a shot of this.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.827
Get those too.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.196
Mitch, get some wild sound.

35:06.671 --> 35:09.106
- Think anybody can see us?

35:10.741 --> 35:12.175
- Let's see.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.854
Hey, get a closeup, okay?

35:24.655 --> 35:27.190
Woo, you like that?

35:28.759 --> 35:29.893
- Very funny.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.628
- What, if you're gonna
make me be up here

35:31.630 --> 35:33.563
I might as well have some fun.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.664
- Hey guys?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.566
I think I found a way in.

35:37.168 --> 35:38.568
- Whoa.

35:40.771 --> 35:43.673
Well come on, what are you
waiting for, Christmas?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.542
- Guys, I'm not sure about this.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.144
Let's just turn around.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.412
- After you made us hike
all the way up here?

35:49.414 --> 35:50.547
- Yeah I don't know man,

35:50.549 --> 35:51.815
maybe she's right.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.251
- Look, you're never
gonna make good films

35:54.253 --> 35:56.720
if you're afraid to
take a few risks, okay?

35:56.722 --> 35:58.855
And you, don't be a pussy.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.891
Don't be a little
pussy, let's go.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.425
- Fine.

36:02.427 --> 36:03.293
- Let's do this.

36:03.295 --> 36:03.860
- Let's make this quick.

36:03.862 --> 36:04.794
- Okay.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.297
Creepy bunker, here we come.

36:11.536 --> 36:12.769
Need help?

36:17.441 --> 36:18.708
Ladies last.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.586
- There are probably
100 people watching us

36:29.588 --> 36:31.288
with those cameras right now.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.656
- If they care so much,

36:32.658 --> 36:35.859
then why would they leave
a giant hole in the gate?

36:35.861 --> 36:40.497
- Yeah, and a security system
older than the dinosaurs.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.237
- You okay?

36:47.738 --> 36:48.772
- Yeah.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.675
Hey, are you mad at me?

36:51.677 --> 36:54.477
You've been acting weird
ever since last night.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.847
- This isn't the time and
place to talk about this.

36:58.783 --> 37:00.884
- What happened last night?

37:03.387 --> 37:04.321
- Nothing.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.389
- Oh come on, in my bed?

37:06.391 --> 37:07.824
- You offered, man.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.960
- You guys had sex in my bed?

37:09.962 --> 37:12.229
How am I ever gonna
sleep in there again?

37:12.231 --> 37:13.797
I'm gonna have to burn it.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.667
- Real classy.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.603
- Oh yeah, well I'm
not the one who had sex

37:19.605 --> 37:21.671
in somebody else's bed.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.455
Hang on, I'm stuck.

37:39.657 --> 37:40.757
Okay.

37:48.699 --> 37:49.733
- Hey, hey.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.534
Get a shot of this.

38:11.322 --> 38:13.790
This place looks abandoned.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.695
- Hey, what do you
think they did in here?

38:18.697 --> 38:20.630
- I'll tell you what
they didn't do in here.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.465
They didn't have sex in here.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.967
- Yeah, nice, Mitch.

38:32.843 --> 38:33.843
- Hey.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.814
Um, look, I'm really sorry.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.418
- It's fine.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.087
- I just, you know,

38:44.089 --> 38:47.357
I have trouble getting
close to people is all.

38:48.759 --> 38:51.394
- I'm just glad I'm
getting this all on camera.

38:51.396 --> 38:52.862
- Jerk.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.712
- Pretty cool, right?

39:08.714 --> 39:10.347
It looks like these
guys are in collusion

39:10.349 --> 39:12.716
with the local county to give
'em a kickback of the profits

39:12.718 --> 39:15.018
if Saxlow can get all the land.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.886
- That's a really
good find, Mitch.

39:16.888 --> 39:17.888
- Thank you.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.724
What was that?

39:26.898 --> 39:27.898
Oh shit!

39:31.402 --> 39:32.135
- Come on!

39:32.137 --> 39:33.103
- Collin!

39:33.105 --> 39:34.504
There's another door over here!

39:34.506 --> 39:35.672
- Here, hold this.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.577
There's a lock on it.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.379
- Here, use this.

39:52.022 --> 39:52.856
- Go!

39:52.858 --> 39:54.090
You got it.

40:06.103 --> 40:07.704
- Hurry up, come on.

40:07.706 --> 40:08.571
What now?

40:08.573 --> 40:09.406
- Climb!

40:09.408 --> 40:10.407
- What are you serious?

40:10.409 --> 40:11.107
Look at this shit.

40:11.109 --> 40:11.975
- You have any better ideas?

40:11.977 --> 40:12.977
- Dude just climb it!

40:14.745 --> 40:16.746
- Feel free to help me anytime.

40:18.015 --> 40:19.015
Shit!

40:20.684 --> 40:21.684
All right.

40:34.498 --> 40:35.632
Hurry up!

40:36.567 --> 40:37.734
Come on.

40:40.938 --> 40:41.704
- Shit.

40:41.706 --> 40:42.572
- You all right?

40:42.574 --> 40:43.440
- Yeah, come on.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.442
Let's go!

41:02.660 --> 41:03.626
- Mr. Kane?

41:03.628 --> 41:05.495
They're getting away.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.896
- That's okay, let them go.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.631
- They took some files.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.633
- Those kids from last night?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.702
- So you know who they are?

41:12.704 --> 41:15.238
- Just some kids
I saw at the bar.

41:17.107 --> 41:20.810
- Your usefulness to
us has come to an end.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.479
- Wait, what?

41:24.515 --> 41:26.483
No, no!

41:29.520 --> 41:30.153
I'll find them.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.788
- You've already failed.

41:31.790 --> 41:32.989
- Donald's screwed
up in the head,

41:32.991 --> 41:34.123
he won't listen to reason.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.259
- Saxlow doesn't pay
you for mistakes.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.094
We pay you for action.

41:38.963 --> 41:41.030
Now Mr. Grey has been
missing for days.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.632
We need to get to
the bottom of this,

41:42.634 --> 41:45.702
and you already know too much.

41:47.972 --> 41:49.005
- Please.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.607
No, please!

41:57.248 --> 41:58.648
- Did we lose 'em?

41:58.650 --> 42:00.850
- Yeah, they're gone,
I don't see them.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.019
- Shit, okay, gotta breathe.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.621
- That's the last
time I ever listen

42:04.623 --> 42:06.089
to one of your
dumbass ideas again.

42:06.091 --> 42:06.890
- What?

42:06.892 --> 42:08.091
My dumb ideas?

42:08.093 --> 42:09.859
This was your fucking
idea to come up here.

42:09.861 --> 42:10.860
You kidding me?

42:10.862 --> 42:12.195
- Both of you shut up.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.296
Shut up.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.064
We're all in this together,

42:15.066 --> 42:17.166
let's just figure
a way out of here.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.702
- Gina, I say we
forget about this film,

42:19.704 --> 42:21.237
we go back to LA right now.

42:23.073 --> 42:26.142
- Great idea, how
do we get back?

42:29.547 --> 42:31.848
- It's over there somewhere.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.785
Hey, check your phone,
see if the GPS is working.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.954
Maybe we can find a good route.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.157
- Oh damn.

42:42.793 --> 42:44.160
Yeah, it's dead.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.896
- Of course.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.265
- Oh my gosh.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.702
I think you need stitches.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.037
- It's fine.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.042
- You have an
audience, you know.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.977
- What the hell is your problem?

43:00.979 --> 43:02.278
- I've just noticed
this habit of yours

43:02.280 --> 43:05.048
to lure men into bed
and then toss 'em aside.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.651
- That was three years ago,
and if I remember right,

43:08.653 --> 43:10.787
you were the one that
did the manipulating.

43:10.789 --> 43:12.956
- Wait, what are we
talking about here?

43:14.058 --> 43:16.326
- Do you wanna tell
him, or should I?

43:19.296 --> 43:21.331
- You had sex with him too?

43:21.333 --> 43:23.066
- Yeah, to her credit,
she only found out

43:23.068 --> 43:25.268
that we're friends
about two weeks ago.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.070
- Wow, okay.

43:27.938 --> 43:28.771
- Collin.

43:28.773 --> 43:29.906
- Whatever.

43:29.908 --> 43:33.376
Believe me, she was well on
her way to ditching you too.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.711
- Shut up Mitch.

43:34.713 --> 43:35.345
- I'm just looking
out for you man.

43:35.347 --> 43:36.679
- Shut the fuck up, man.

43:36.681 --> 43:38.161
- Why don't you shut
the fuck up, ass?

43:40.918 --> 43:41.985
- You lost?

43:41.987 --> 43:45.855
- Yeah, we're
looking for our car.

43:47.191 --> 43:49.225
- All right, follow me.

43:53.131 --> 43:57.934
You're gonna follow Justin
Bieber's evil twin up here?

43:57.936 --> 43:59.802
- What else are we gonna
do, it's getting dark.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.638
- She probably wants
to sleep with him too.

44:02.339 --> 44:04.140
- This is not a good idea.

44:06.210 --> 44:07.810
- This isn't over yet.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.646
- Oh whatever, dude.

44:10.247 --> 44:12.315
- What are you doing out here?

44:12.317 --> 44:14.417
- I should ask you that.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.719
- We were on a hike.

44:19.256 --> 44:21.424
- Making a documentary.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.930
Our house is close by.

44:27.932 --> 44:30.800
My dad can give you
a ride to your car.

44:53.757 --> 44:54.991
- Jamison?

44:55.859 --> 44:58.061
- I found 'em lost in the hills.

44:58.063 --> 45:01.030
- Sorry, we just need
to get back to our car.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.965
- I told 'em Dad
could give 'em a ride.

45:02.967 --> 45:04.300
- Oh, he'd be happy to.

45:04.302 --> 45:07.003
And he'll be home any minute.

45:07.738 --> 45:09.338
That needs attention.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.241
- It's just a scratch really.

45:12.243 --> 45:13.943
- Let me take care of it.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.445
It's no trouble, come with me.

45:15.447 --> 45:18.715
And you can all put your
things on the back porch.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.215
- Thank you.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.217
- Take this.

45:37.835 --> 45:40.737
- This is a nasty cut.

45:52.382 --> 45:54.751
That should be good for now.

45:56.286 --> 45:57.820
- Thank you.

46:04.962 --> 46:07.096
- Make yourselves at home.

46:07.098 --> 46:10.233
It's not often we
get any visitors.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.138
Oh, let me go get some snacks.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.944
- Can you move over?

46:34.258 --> 46:35.558
- Who are they?

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
- None of your
business, dillweed.

46:37.562 --> 46:39.162
I found them.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.465
- You found them?

46:43.367 --> 46:45.034
Excuse my brother.

46:45.036 --> 46:46.869
He's a dillweed.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.839
How do you do?

46:49.841 --> 46:52.108
- Jesus, they're not royalty.

46:52.110 --> 46:53.409
- It's polite.

46:55.312 --> 46:56.445
Kelsey.

46:57.981 --> 46:58.948
- Collin.

46:58.950 --> 47:00.383
- And Gina.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.454
- What are you wearing?

47:05.456 --> 47:06.856
- Clothes.

47:06.858 --> 47:09.592
- Go to your room and
put on something decent.

47:09.594 --> 47:12.161
What if your father
were to come home?

47:14.832 --> 47:17.300
- Do you guys have an
extra outlet I could use

47:17.302 --> 47:18.501
to charge my iPhone?

47:18.503 --> 47:22.238
- You know actually
Mom, I can take him.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.373
Come with me, mister handsome.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.142
- Why thank you.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.144
- Don't let them bore you.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.011
- Let's go.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.013
- Kelsey.

47:44.394 --> 47:45.628
- Thank you.

47:47.164 --> 47:49.265
She was being paranoid.

47:49.267 --> 47:50.466
It's fine.

47:52.236 --> 47:55.304
- Oh, all we have
here is well water.

47:57.441 --> 47:58.908
- Well.

48:05.582 --> 48:08.251
- My husband should
be home any moment.

48:08.253 --> 48:09.385
- Great.

48:16.393 --> 48:19.896
- Wow, your muscles are strong.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.531
- How old are you?

48:24.034 --> 48:25.067
- 18.

48:26.570 --> 48:28.204
- Perfect.

48:29.573 --> 48:33.242
- All right, you can plug
your phone in over there.

48:33.244 --> 48:34.477
- Ah, right.

48:34.479 --> 48:36.612
- Mom wants me to change.

48:36.614 --> 48:39.448
- Thanks for letting
me use the outlet.

48:41.051 --> 48:43.185
I like all your stuffed animals.

48:46.456 --> 48:47.990
Yeah.

48:47.992 --> 48:51.027
- You know, we don't
really get many visitors.

48:51.029 --> 48:54.163
Especially not
handsome ones like you.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.567
Don't worry, I'll be quiet.

49:09.079 --> 49:11.047
- Is that your husband?

49:15.519 --> 49:17.520
- You make an adorable couple.

49:17.522 --> 49:18.654
- Oh, we're not.

49:18.656 --> 49:21.090
- No, just friends.

49:25.729 --> 49:28.097
- Do you have
an older son as well?

49:28.099 --> 49:31.033
- No, these are
our only children.

49:33.537 --> 49:38.240
Oh, Ferris, my oldest,
was killed many years ago.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.443
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

49:42.279 --> 49:45.081
My parents died
when I was young.

49:48.018 --> 49:49.151
- Well if you'll excuse me,

49:49.153 --> 49:51.721
I am going to finish
preparing supper.

50:02.532 --> 50:04.266
- So what's it like?

50:06.003 --> 50:07.737
- What's what like?

50:08.338 --> 50:10.306
- Not having parents.

50:10.308 --> 50:14.010
- Well I lived with
my uncle, he was nice.

50:14.012 --> 50:15.678
But you should be grateful

50:15.680 --> 50:17.780
you have both your
parents with you.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.115
- No.

50:19.117 --> 50:22.084
Sometimes I wish I
didn't have parents.

50:22.086 --> 50:24.186
- Why would you say that?

50:24.188 --> 50:26.689
- Well, just not my dad.

50:28.392 --> 50:30.726
He never lets me do anything.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.428
Anything.

50:34.398 --> 50:35.631
- Mary?

50:36.800 --> 50:39.602
- Kelsey, your father's home!

50:41.538 --> 50:43.105
- It's that guy from last night.

50:43.107 --> 50:44.473
- What are they doing here?

50:44.475 --> 50:47.176
- These lovely folks need
a ride back to their car

50:47.178 --> 50:50.613
because Jamison found them
lost behind the house.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.082
- We were hiking.

50:53.550 --> 50:56.152
- I guess I should have
been expecting you.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.186
- What?

50:59.489 --> 51:00.589
- Hey Dad.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.492
- Hey guys.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.531
- Sure, I could give you
a ride back to your car.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.166
But you must be hungry,

51:10.168 --> 51:13.069
why don't you stay and
join us for dinner?

51:13.071 --> 51:14.136
- Sure!

51:14.438 --> 51:15.671
- Great, well that's wonderful.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.273
Kids, go wash up.

51:17.275 --> 51:20.109
Mary, I'll help
you in the kitchen.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.751
- I am not going in there.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.319
- Are you kidding me?

51:30.321 --> 51:32.254
This is the perfect subject
for your documentary,

51:32.256 --> 51:33.756
locals affected by the fracking.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.724
- That guy is a total freak.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.326
- He barely said anything.

51:37.328 --> 51:38.727
- Tell him.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.868
That's the guy from last
night, the guy from the pub.

51:45.870 --> 51:47.203
- And?

51:47.205 --> 51:48.604
- The guy that
bashed the other guy.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.739
- Yes, I know, which makes
it an even better story.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.541
You guys, this is a
much better documentary

51:52.543 --> 51:53.776
than the band stuff.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.678
This could be award winning.

51:57.481 --> 51:58.514
Kelsey.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.416
- Jerk.

52:00.852 --> 52:03.619
- Thanks for backing me up.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.857
- I guess we're both
full of surprises.

52:19.203 --> 52:20.369
Thanks for dinner.

52:20.371 --> 52:21.871
- This food looks amazing.

52:21.873 --> 52:23.372
- Thank you dear.

52:26.443 --> 52:27.576
- Eat up.

52:32.749 --> 52:35.518
So what's wrong with your car?

52:36.453 --> 52:37.820
- Nothing.

52:37.822 --> 52:41.524
We just got turned around
when we were on our hike.

52:45.929 --> 52:48.264
- Mm, it's so good.

52:53.637 --> 52:55.271
- Excuse me.

53:01.912 --> 53:02.912
- Mm.

53:04.414 --> 53:05.214
- Yes?

53:05.216 --> 53:06.615
- Mr. Connors?

53:06.617 --> 53:08.317
Sorry to bother you sir.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.685
- Is there a problem?

53:09.687 --> 53:11.187
- Yes sir, there was a report
of three college students

53:11.189 --> 53:13.189
that went missing, we
were just wondering

53:13.191 --> 53:15.191
if maybe you'd seen
anything unusual.

53:15.193 --> 53:18.327
- No, it's been pretty
quiet around here.

53:18.329 --> 53:19.295
- Yes sir.

53:19.297 --> 53:20.462
Well there were three of them

53:20.464 --> 53:22.765
and they were last
seen in this area.

53:22.767 --> 53:25.367
- Well I'll keep my eyes open.

53:25.369 --> 53:28.871
Along with the other one
that also went missing.

53:28.873 --> 53:29.705
- Sorry?

53:29.707 --> 53:32.875
- Yes, a Mr. Grey,

53:32.877 --> 53:35.778
Mr. Arthur Grey from
Saxlow Industries.

53:35.780 --> 53:38.347
He also went missing.

53:38.349 --> 53:39.315
- Goodness.

53:39.317 --> 53:40.583
- Anything.

53:40.585 --> 53:43.586
- No, I don't know
anything about that either.

53:43.588 --> 53:47.890
My family's just sitting down
to dinner, so if you'll...

53:47.892 --> 53:49.358
- I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.492
- All right, good night.

53:50.494 --> 53:51.460
Stay safe.

53:51.462 --> 53:52.695
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

54:05.642 --> 54:07.409
He's got them.

54:44.681 --> 54:46.482
- Who was at the door, honey?

54:46.484 --> 54:47.716
- Bible salesman.

54:47.718 --> 54:49.718
- They never quit, do they?

54:52.455 --> 54:54.556
So where did you say
you're from again, dear?

54:54.558 --> 54:55.658
- Los Angeles.

54:56.660 --> 54:57.626
- Big city.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.595
That's so exciting.

55:05.535 --> 55:07.503
- Um, I'm not feeling well.

55:07.505 --> 55:08.837
- Would you like some water?

55:08.839 --> 55:10.606
- No, thank you.

55:10.608 --> 55:12.474
- Can I get you something else?

55:12.476 --> 55:13.342
Some milk?

55:13.344 --> 55:14.576
- Really, I'm okay.

55:27.390 --> 55:29.858
- I think I should take
them to their car now.

55:29.860 --> 55:30.959
- So soon?

55:33.330 --> 55:34.797
- It's dark out.

55:42.472 --> 55:43.939
- Thank you again for dinner.

55:43.941 --> 55:46.375
- Certainly, you take care now.

55:48.111 --> 55:50.946
- Nice meeting all
of you, goodbye.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.000
- Why don't you boys
ride in the back,

56:12.002 --> 56:14.837
we'll let the young
lady ride up front.

56:17.874 --> 56:18.907
- Wait.

56:21.945 --> 56:23.946
It was nice meeting you, okay?

56:23.948 --> 56:24.913
- You too.

56:24.915 --> 56:26.882
See you soon.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.884
- Yeah, have fun.

56:31.621 --> 56:33.122
- Coming, coming.

56:37.660 --> 56:39.094
Prick.

56:47.504 --> 56:51.039
- Where'd your friend get
that nasty cut on his leg?

56:51.941 --> 56:54.810
- He slipped on
some jagged rocks.

56:57.881 --> 57:00.816
- You think they'll
be okay back there?

57:08.158 --> 57:10.492
- We parked on a dirt
road near a gate.

57:10.494 --> 57:11.827
It said Saxlow.

57:13.663 --> 57:16.765
- I know, I know where that is.

57:17.734 --> 57:21.170
Now where did I put that,

57:22.639 --> 57:23.639
oh there.

57:28.845 --> 57:31.013
Now I think we're ready.

57:56.506 --> 57:58.507
- He's looking right at me.

57:58.509 --> 58:00.843
- We'll be at the truck soon.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.299
- Why am I...?

58:58.167 --> 59:00.769
- Oh, you just relax.

59:05.174 --> 59:08.844
- My face feels like
it was smashed in.

59:12.715 --> 59:13.916
Where's Collin?

59:13.918 --> 59:15.784
- Oh, he's fine.

59:17.754 --> 59:19.588
- Can I see him?

59:19.590 --> 59:21.924
- You'll see him soon enough.

59:21.926 --> 59:24.793
You've been in a
horrible accident.

59:24.795 --> 59:26.962
Just relax, honey.

59:30.600 --> 59:31.733
- What is this?

59:31.735 --> 59:33.669
- Oh, that's just
a heart monitor.

59:33.671 --> 59:35.704
The hospital told
us to put it on

59:35.706 --> 59:38.073
until the ambulance arrives.

59:38.875 --> 59:40.208
Relax honey.

59:48.184 --> 59:49.818
You don't go riling her up.

59:49.820 --> 59:51.119
- Hey, get lost Mom.

59:54.223 --> 59:56.258
- You get some rest.

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:40.102
- Do you know how I
can get this thing off?

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.303
- Does it hurt?

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.774
- Just help me get
it off, please.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.709
- No, I'm not allowed.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.779
What are you doing?

01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.881
- I need to find my friends.

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.088
- Okay, look, if I help you,

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:04.259
will you promise to stay
and hang out for a while?

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.094
I'll even forgive you.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:08.363
- Forgive me for what?

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.233
- For being part of
Saxlow Industries.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.402
- What are you talking about?

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:15.270
Just take me to my friends.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.738
- No no, not yet.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.140
- Yes, now.

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.211
What the fuck?

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.247
- I'm sorry, look, I
can't let you leave.

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.249
- Give me that.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.421
- I'm sorry, okay, it's not...

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.257
I'm sorry.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:51.900
- Thirsty?

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.804
- What are you doing?

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.973
Why am I tied up?

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.477
Gina, Mitch!

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:06.014
- You can yell all you want
but they can't hear you.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.784
Is this yours?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.355
- No, we found
that in the bunker.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:16.057
- Is that when you cut your leg?

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:17.059
- Yeah.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.228
- Not on jagged rocks.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.296
- No.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:28.170
- He told me you'd come.

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:29.504
- What are you talking about?

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:32.040
- No no no no no, no more lies.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:34.910
I know who you are
and why you're here.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.545
- We got lost, we
couldn't find our car.

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:39.147
- Do you think I'm
a fucking idiot?

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.949
You work for them!

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.218
- Who is them?

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.854
This is a mistake, all right?

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.255
If you let me go...

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:51.226
I've been letting you
people go for 10 years!

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.994
You trespass on my property,

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.429
you intimidate my children,

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.064
you lie, you lie
right to my face.

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:57.499
- That is not us!

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.034
- You're a little fucking liar!

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.508
- Listen, this is
just a mistake.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.876
- All right, now listen to me.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.044
- Don't.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.246
- Now listen to me,
this is very important.

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:13.415
I want you to pay attention.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.984
I need for you to
understand this.

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:18.854
Stop fucking with my family!

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:29.531
- I didn't wanna do this,
but you left me no choice.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.376
- Let my friends go.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.245
This was all my idea,
I made them do it.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.481
It had nothing to do with them.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:23.919
I thought this was all just
a big misunderstanding.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.657
- Please let them go.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:31.960
- Goodness, you're a
little hero, aren't you?

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.228
Now hold still.

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:42.003
I know, I know, but listen,

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:44.406
it's going to purify
you from the inside out.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:45.640
All right?

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.591
- Hello mister handsome.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.162
Mama says your ribs are broken.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:10.665
The ambulance is coming to
take you away real soon, okay?

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.469
- Where the hell am I?

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.538
- You're back with
me, silly boy.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.141
We just made love in this
room a little bit ago.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.710
- What are you talking about?

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.478
Why am I here?

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.512
Ow!

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.085
- Daddy says it's necessary.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.087
- Your dad's a fucking asshole!

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.489
- Don't say that about
your future father-in-law.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.690
- What?

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.425
- Soon as your better
we're gonna get married.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.060
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:40.495
- I know, I can't wait either.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.730
It's gonna be soon though.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.531
- Ow.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.266
- Shh, baby it's okay.

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:46.568
It's all right.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.204
- No no no, get the
fuck off the bed!

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:50.705
Ow, fuck!

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.444
- You know,

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:01.182
I thought maybe we could
fool around for a little bit.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.184
- Shit.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:06.021
Where are my friends?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.792
- You're never gonna get
out of here, you know.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.496
Not without my help anyways.

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.768
What are you looking for?

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.540
Do you think I'm beautiful?

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.146
Most boys do.

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:34.549
- Yeah.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.751
Yeah, I could see that.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:44.225
- You know, Daddy doesn't
like me seeing boys.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.264
Is that better?

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:51.332
You don't have to fight.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.805
- Shit, fuck.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.075
Ow!

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.143
Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:04.345
- Please, get back
in bed please, or my
dad's gonna kill me.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.247
- Not my problem.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.116
- You leave, I'll scream.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:11.453
- Then go ahead and
scream, you little bitch.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:45.066
- Oh yeah, I sent you a request.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.304
- What's wrong with you people?

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.006
Take me to Collin, please.

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:54.709
I just need to know he's okay.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:16.531
You were really hoping we
could be friends, weren't you?

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.081
- Jamison, bring...

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.051
Dammit Jamison!

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:41.122
Can you do something
right for once, just once?

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:45.626
Now go help your sister and
bring her down to the basement!

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:46.961
Come on boy!

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.017
- What the hell did you do?

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:11.486
- He tried to leave.

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.490
Will you help me get him to Dad?

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:17.458
- No, Dad wants her first.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.626
Let's go.

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:21.155
Throw that one on the tarp,
and then get over here

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:24.225
and help me get this
one up on the table.

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:27.795
- Gina!

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.497
What are you doing to her?

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:30.498
- Come on, boy.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.732
- This is stupid.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.234
- What did I tell you
about using that word?

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:35.736
Don't you ever use
that word again!

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.840
Now help me carry him.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.709
Come on, grab that side.

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:51.652
- I will kill you
when I get out of here.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.787
- I don't think so.

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.155
Tape his mouth shut.

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.125
Just do it!

01:14:58.127 --> 01:14:59.260
- I am.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.162
- Oh just give me that.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:04.966
Look, go get that one
and put her in the chair.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.205
Just pick her up Jamison!

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.206
- I can't!

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:13.808
- Oh my God, can
you do anything?

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.784
Take these and strap
her in from the back.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:25.119
- I need your help.

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:27.655
- Fine, fine,
Jamison, go with her.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:28.956
I'll do this.

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.204
Lots of work.

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.140
Lots of work left to do.

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.116
Work to do.

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.853
- Where is he?

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.122
There he is, let's go.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.257
Come on, grab his foot.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.092
Grab his foot!

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.928
- We don't have to do this.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.029
- I said do it.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.196
Grab his foot.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:10.598
Let's go!

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.187
- Good, good, good.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:35.957
Yeah, bring that one and
put him in the corner here.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.194
- Dammit, get him up.

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:44.131
- Good, bring him over here.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:46.367
Put him in the corner here.

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:52.206
Stand him up for me, hold him.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.109
Hey kid, can you hear me?

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.078
I wanna ask you a question.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.212
- What?

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.114
- How did you like
fucking my daughter?

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.686
You murder my son and then
you defile my little girl?

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:07.888
What is wrong with you people?

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.692
- Mitch, what did
they do to you?

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.961
- No no no, you did this to him.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.964
This is your fault,
and I hate you for it!

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.033
- You're a fucking psycho!

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.235
Your son brought us here!

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.937
- No no no, you're
lying, you're lying,

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:26.641
see your pretty little boyfriend
here, he already confessed!

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.877
- I'm so sorry.

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.079
I should have listened.

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.714
- Do you know what
you people are?

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:34.915
You are parasites!

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:37.351
You just take and take and take

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:40.054
until all I have left is hate!

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.889
God!

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.959
Hand me that screwdriver.

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:46.360
Give me the screwdriver.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.796
No not that one,
the big, this one.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.264
Now pay attention.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:53.300
And you pay attention
too, you pay attention.

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:58.372
- Collin!

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:00.141
- Pay attention.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.912
- Stop, please.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:07.248
Let him go, it's all
my fucking fault.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.150
- Are you paying attention?

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:11.819
- Whatever we did,
it's my fault.

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:12.987
Kill me.

01:18:12.989 --> 01:18:14.221
- Kill you?

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.157
Oh, your turn is gonna come.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.358
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.994
to make sure none of you
people ever come back!

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:21.862
- Collin.

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.901
- Do you like watching this?

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.937
Do you like watching me
take your friend's life

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:33.207
piece by piece, 'cause
that's what you did to me.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:36.844
You took my life,
bit by bit by bit.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:37.912
- Please.

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:41.215
Please, whatever you want.

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.489
- Whatever I want?

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:50.891
Do you know what I want?

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.061
I want my son back!

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.369
- Please.

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.906
I can't lose him.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.277
I love him.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.315
- Love?

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.953
Jamison, lift him up!

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:21.856
Get over there and lift him up!

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:28.095
Love?
- No, no.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.133
- I'm gonna show you love.

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.835
There's love!

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.371
All right, go take the
slack out of his chain.

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:38.339
Go take him out.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.307
- No, Collin.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:49.450
- I don't think we
need this anymore.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:54.421
- We were just
trying to make a film.

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:55.956
We wanted to show people...

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:56.958
- Lift him up.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.294
- No Collin, no.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.563
- All right, take him off.

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:05.032
- No, no.

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:08.035
- Come here and pull this
table out of the way.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:15.109
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:18.479
Running down his leg and all
the way into the lower leg

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:21.048
is the popliteal artery.

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:24.251
If you cut that and you
have your subject elevated,

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:26.954
he'll bleed out in
just a few minutes.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.857
- How do you know they're
not telling the truth?

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:32.126
- Don't ever you
question me, boy!

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:33.394
Ever!

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:40.301
Pay attention.

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:44.605
Right here.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.108
Right there, open it up.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.281
And here, same thing.

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:55.583
Right here.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.395
Dress this body,

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:11.131
and put the limbs
in that garbage can,

01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:15.002
and then move the table
back to where it was.

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:21.141
And then I want her
up on the table.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:24.078
Have that done
before I get back.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.608
- Yeah, we got blood.

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:02.676
- Doesn't matter.

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:05.145
Mr. Kane said they're all here.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.547
Finish the job.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:27.534
- You're just your
dad's little tool.

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:28.669
- Hey fuck you!

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.137
Fuck my dad.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.307
- If he's such an asshole,

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.242
why do you listen to him?

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.644
He doesn't even see you anymore.

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:41.148
I can tell by the
way he looks at you.

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:43.684
All he sees is disappointment.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.152
- Well you're
gonna be dead soon,

01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:46.754
so it doesn't matter
what you think.

01:23:46.756 --> 01:23:51.625
Well you'll still always
know what he really feels.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:58.098
Mitch, you're alive?

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.435
- Stay the fuck away from me.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:04.772
- Look, we'll tell the
police it was all your dad.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.142
You know what you're
doing is wrong.

01:24:08.144 --> 01:24:09.143
- No no no, no.

01:24:09.145 --> 01:24:10.677
No, what you did was wrong.

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:12.379
You're the one who came here.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.681
You're the one who
made my dad angry.

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:16.583
This is your fault!

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:19.286
- You could still have
a normal life someday.

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:20.554
- I said shut up!

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.523
You think your life is normal?

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:24.425
I'm just as normal as you,

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:26.794
why can't you see that?

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.599
- It's only a matter of
time before you're caught.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:38.105
- You are never gonna see
the light of day again.

01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:39.306
Ever!

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:49.616
- Gina.

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.187
I'm gonna die out here.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:54.388
- No Mitch,

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:56.623
you're gonna be
just fine, trust me.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:59.426
- I'm sorry about what
I said the other day.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.695
About you being an orphan.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:06.366
- Let's just get out of here.

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.236
- My mom.

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.739
Oh God, my mom.

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:16.443
Can you please tell her

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:20.247
that I'm sorry that I never...

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.583
- Mitch no!

01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:24.451
We're gonna be okay, Mitch.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.386
Mitch, come on.

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:27.855
Mitch, no.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.158
No, Mitch, no.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160
No.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.379
- Why are you crying?

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.783
Please, stop crying.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:07.294
- Your dad will never
be proud of you,

01:26:07.296 --> 01:26:09.496
no matter what you do.

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.410
- Came from the basement.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.406
- Son of a...

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.711
Son of a bitch!

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:37.384
What happened?

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:38.485
- Dad, I'm sorry.

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:39.586
- Where's the girl?

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:40.587
- They came down here.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.788
I was doing everything you said.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:45.259
She hit me and left, I
did everything you said.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.996
- You're fucking worthless!

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.411
- If you'd like to make a call,

01:28:37.413 --> 01:28:38.945
please hang up and try again.

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.920
- Oh no, no no no no!

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:52.626
I knew I shouldn't have left
those kids alone with you.

01:28:52.628 --> 01:28:53.927
That was stupid!

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:55.362
- Let me go!

01:28:55.364 --> 01:28:58.498
- No, that's not
part of that plan.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.733
- No.

01:28:59.735 --> 01:29:01.702
- You are not going anywhere.

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:07.741
You know, this is
all your fault.

01:29:07.743 --> 01:29:10.711
But now, you and the shadow gang

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:13.947
are not gonna bother me anymore!

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.460
- It wasn't us.

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:32.632
We were just trying to
make a film for school.

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:38.772
- That warm feeling you're
experiencing right now?

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:42.809
That's your brain shutting down.

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:49.549
I think my son Ferris must
have felt that same feeling.

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.522
- Get away.

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:58.492
- Oh for God's sake.

01:29:58.494 --> 01:30:00.994
Have some fucking dignity.

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:06.733
Oh you're so precious.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:09.102
You just don't wanna give up.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.510
Well, it's your time now.

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.946
Say goodnight.

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:09.956
- God, Mom.

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:11.191
- Stop it.

01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:13.059
- It hurts.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.012
What is it?

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.683
- What happened?

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:58.939
- I need an ambulance.

01:32:58.941 --> 01:33:00.774
I need an ambulance now.

01:33:00.776 --> 01:33:03.643
Cassidy Way and
Crown Valley Road.

01:33:03.645 --> 01:33:05.712
I don't know, it's two people,

01:33:05.714 --> 01:33:07.948
it doesn't look
like an accident.

01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:09.916
I need an ambulance now.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:11.651
One of them is alive.

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:14.020
One of them is alive, hurry!

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.756
- Help me.
