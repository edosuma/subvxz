WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:06.420
So, Dyson, you're not worried about
your co-workers walking in on us?

00:06.507 --> 00:09.123
Gotta love statutory holidays.

00:15.016 --> 00:18.634
Right on your desk, huh?
Hardly police protocol.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.116
That was...

00:40.208 --> 00:42.950
Loud.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.126
I hope the neighbours
don't call the cops.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.498
I am the cops.

00:46.589 --> 00:50.298
Well, thank you for responding
to my emergency, Officer.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.716
'Cause when I need to heal,
I need it now.

00:52.803 --> 00:56.967
Yeah, funny thing, though, I didn't
notice so much as a scratch on you.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.175
What can I say? l was hungry.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.476
Speaking of which, who's a
girl got to do around here

01:02.563 --> 01:04.599
to get some breakfast, huh?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.850
Breakfast, huh?

01:08.945 --> 01:10.901
That might make things confusing.

01:10.988 --> 01:14.480
Fine. No breakfast. Is that a rule?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.066
I never much liked rules,
but maybe we should have some.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.823
Seriously? It feels kind of high school.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.246
I wouldn't know, never went.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.073
Okay.

01:25.127 --> 01:30.463
Well, in the spirit of
clarifying this, what else?

01:31.968 --> 01:36.337
Rule number two: No discussing our
arrangement with other people.

01:36.430 --> 01:41.720
Hmm, exception--Kenzi. She already
knows and she pouts when l fib.

01:41.811 --> 01:45.850
Okay. Rule three: We come, we go,

01:45.940 --> 01:48.056
no questions asked,
no sad good-byes.

01:48.150 --> 01:53.611
Ooh, good one. And how about,
as long as we're doing this,

01:53.698 --> 01:57.907
you don't get to give me that, "I
don't get to take this case" speech.

01:57.994 --> 02:01.202
As long as you always tell
me what cases you do take.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.904
Deal.

02:02.999 --> 02:06.036
And as far as seeing other people?

02:06.127 --> 02:09.164
Well, we're not exclusive, right?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.084
Right.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.087
--Right.
--Right. Okay.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.053
--What are you doing?
--Wa|king you to your car.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.977
No sad good-byes, remember?

02:27.148 --> 02:29.981
I'm not crying, I'm just seeing you out.

02:30.067 --> 02:34.436
Don't you get it, Dyson?
I can take care of myself.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.657
Hey, princess.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.329
Oh, great.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.122
Sorry about your--

02:51.213 --> 02:52.828
Get in the van.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.299
Nuts.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.085
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.092
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.095
My love carries a death sentence.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.177
l was lost for years,

03:07.271 --> 03:09.933
searching, while hiding,

03:10.024 --> 03:14.142
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:14.236 --> 03:19.151
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:27.041 --> 03:32.877
Ms. Sizemore, Bo Investigates
is the premier P.l. service in the city.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.214
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.710
I honestly don't know
where else to turn.

03:36.801 --> 03:39.964
Well, tell me what we're
dealing with here.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.467
She's trying to kill me. I know that
may not seem like a big deal.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.141
Oh, that sounds like
a massive dealio, yes.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.810
Does this "she" have a name?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.229
Ms. Snickerpants.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.820
Your boss?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.690
My cat.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.319
Uh huh.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.402
I went to the police. They
looked at me like I was crazy.

04:05.496 --> 04:09.865
Crazy? Gosh, hardly.

04:09.959 --> 04:13.042
You know we get paid in
real-life money, right?

04:13.129 --> 04:14.744
Oh.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.005
Would you like some more cream soda?

04:19.093 --> 04:22.335
Could we please get
some more cream soda?

04:22.430 --> 04:25.342
Bo will be here any minute.
She's just detained.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.890
Probably wrangling
another sociopathic kitty.

04:27.977 --> 04:35.725
Oh, Ms. Snickerpants isn't a
sociopath, she's possessed. See?

04:35.818 --> 04:40.027
Yes. That's becoming quite clear.

04:40.114 --> 04:43.732
I'm just going to check
my messages again, okay?

04:43.826 --> 04:46.738
This really puts the "suck" in succubus.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.540
Yanking girls off the street, huh?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.788
It's a helluva way to drum
up business for the dim sum.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.212
You guys go wait in the van.
I got little Miss Thing here.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.835
Thing this.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.686
You know, you really
should invest in a cup.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.694
Thanks, but I'll take my
Egg Foo Young to go.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.366
You're out of luck, kid.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.615
I should know. I feed off the stuff.

05:41.509 --> 05:51.009
So, I'm Mayer. The boob that you nailed
in the kishkes is my nephew, Seymour.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.932
I told you she was no good.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.184
Oh, I'd say she's very good.
Now get her some water.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.855
Water!

06:02.863 --> 06:05.149
Now we can talk.

06:08.369 --> 06:13.659
I'd like to hire you. Investigate
a little problem I'm having.

06:13.749 --> 06:17.662
You kidnap me, clearly
need family therapy.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.459
It's not a great first impression, Mayer.

06:19.547 --> 06:23.790
Let me explain.
Maybe we can help each other.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.840
Like I mentioned, I'm a luck Fae.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.795
I feed off the luck of humans
who come here to bet.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.972
In the human world, | work as a bookie,

06:32.059 --> 06:36.302
run numbers on everything from
sports to natural disasters.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.979
Sounds super, but I'm
not much of a gambler.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.897
No, but you're something better.

06:40.985 --> 06:45.319
You're not a Dark Fae.
You can go where my guys can't.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.362
What? Places that
require good hygiene?

06:47.449 --> 06:51.658
I'm serious. I've been
duped by a human.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.908
My security tapes from yesterday.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.241
l was having a business
matter with Seymour,

06:58.335 --> 07:01.327
when in came one of my
favourite customers, Roger.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.253
--[BO] He got a last name?
--No last name required.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.546
He always paid cash.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.501
I've been feeding off Roger for years.
The schmuck virtually had no luck left.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.006
So, why did you take his bet?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.930
Well, I got to make cash
for the guys upstairs.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.508
I take it you're acquainted
with The Morrigan?

07:15.603 --> 07:16.683
Yeah, what a peach.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.180
Don't get me started.

07:18.272 --> 07:22.515
Still, it's a perfect fit--| eat
and provide funds for our side.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.852
This time, things didn't go as planned.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.188
Now, I had drained Roger of all his luck.

07:29.283 --> 07:33.151
There was no way he could
have won on his own.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.546
[BO] Again, I'm here...?

07:53.641 --> 07:56.132
I need an outsider to
investigate Roger.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.933
Someone who won't
advertise my little problem.

07:59.021 --> 08:03.060
Even if I could forget that you
van-napped me, which I won't,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.060
why would I help you?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.063
Because I can give you
ten minutes with my niece.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.236
Oh, tempting. Is she cute?

08:09.323 --> 08:13.407
Word on the street is you want
to know where you came from.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.450
She sees things.

08:15.537 --> 08:19.576
I'll let you have a taste
for free and you'll see.

08:19.667 --> 08:25.412
Cassie's the real deal.
A bona fide oracle.

08:25.506 --> 08:29.215
[gong]

08:32.012 --> 08:35.300
What up, homies?

08:35.391 --> 08:37.382
[BO] You got to be kidding me.

08:41.105 --> 08:44.188
Bo, pick up. This is me
leaving a fifth message.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.810
I really hope you're on your way.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.643
Paranoid Puss in Boots
is getting shifty.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.604
Where are you going?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.281
To find a private investigator
who will take me seriously.

08:54.368 --> 08:58.702
Ma'am, we are serious as shit,
okay? Bo is just a little late.

08:58.789 --> 09:03.158
How are you going to find a way to cure
my cat if you can't even find your boss?

09:03.252 --> 09:09.623
Bo's not my boss. She's the muscle.
Well, the love muscle of sorts.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.878
--Amateurs.
--Okay. Fine.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.129
Bo's obviously not coming,

09:13.220 --> 09:17.554
but I am willing to take
your case for half the price.

09:17.641 --> 09:21.179
Please. I'm not going
to hire the assistant.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.019
And I can't cover the check.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.691
Thanks, Bo.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.647
You? You're going to read my future?

09:34.742 --> 09:39.076
What was, what will be,
the whole shit sandwich.

09:39.163 --> 09:43.076
I need to know who my parents
were. But how do I know if--

09:43.167 --> 09:48.082
I'm telling the truth?
Why don't we visit your past?

09:48.172 --> 09:53.542
See if we can't stir up something
significant. Come here.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.179
You were 18.

10:07.274 --> 10:12.268
He was your first love. Kurt. No, Kyle.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.614
He wanted what all boys want.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.906
Your parents taught you
it was wrong, very wrong.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.326
But he persisted and you adored him.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.876
Then you got hungry.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.422
You fed on him, drained him,
then passed out.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.133
When you awoke, you came
face-to-face with your true self,

10:40.224 --> 10:42.465
with your birthright.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.345
With death.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.226
You had no idea what that meant.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.730
What you were--
a sinner, a killer, a beast.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.938
So you ran. Haven't been back since.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.911
I told you l was legit.

11:03.997 --> 11:08.787
Channeling totally gives me
cottonmouth. You got a mint?

11:20.556 --> 11:23.673
So, we got a deal?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.428
You can't trust her.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.305
Another groin shot for the road?

11:27.396 --> 11:31.639
| find out how Roger beat the
house, Cassie reads me again.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.816
This time, about my parents.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.485
Good luck.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.814
Like you got any to spare.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.783
[BO] Hello.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.287
You're a tardy 'tang.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.039
Did Kenzi wake up on the
wrong side of the bed?

11:53.130 --> 11:55.792
We can't afford beds, remember?
We had a meeting.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.669
Aw, shit. Client.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.886
Yeah, I upload the
calendar to your phone,

11:59.970 --> 12:01.801
l tape post-it reminders over the sink.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.631
--Kenzi.
--Dude, I even learned how to spreadsheet.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.842
Me. 'Cause it's my way of contributing.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.847
Somebody's got to
keep you on schedule.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.519
I'm not a train.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.349
No, you're the talent
with a great caboose.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.229
Do you think I like
acting like the adult?

12:16.320 --> 12:20.984
Probably no more than I enjoy being
abducted off the street two hours ago.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.029
And I'm a dink.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.904
No, I should have called
once I earned my freedom.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.405
What happened?

12:26.496 --> 12:31.365
Van, Dark Fae. Potential
information about my parents.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.700
I'm sorry.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.001
Fortune cookie?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.043
Now where are you going?

12:36.131 --> 12:40.215
Okay, just bank the outrage for awhile,
okay? Mama's too tired to chat.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.886
Oh, but could you call Dyson and
tell him I'd love to talk? Thanks.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.931
Will do... partner.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.056
So, we'll take this image
from the security tape

12:56.151 --> 12:59.109
and we'll run it through
the facial recognition.

12:59.196 --> 13:05.032
And she wets herself over
your geek skills. My bad.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.949
I don't like you working for Mayer.

13:07.037 --> 13:11.701
Too bad you don't get to tell me what cases
I can take anymore, as per our agreement.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.875
Just think of it as getting
free intel on the Dark.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.079
Why doesn't Mayer have his
own guys looking into this?

13:18.173 --> 13:21.586
He probably doesn't want his
Fae bosses to know he got conned.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.259
Interesting. Here it is.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.302
Thanks. See you around?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.680
Could be.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.932
Right behind you.
Just got to hit the ladies' room.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.273
Ijust barfed in my mouth.

13:42.364 --> 13:46.607
Dude, I can't believe I backed you with
Bo. You make me look like a total tool.

13:46.702 --> 13:51.412
The worst part is you treated her like
shit, but somehow, you're forgiven.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.958
That is why I'm no
longer on Team Dyson.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.035
Peace.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.177
[BO] So, what was that back
there with Dyson, huh?

14:12.269 --> 14:14.931
[KENZI] A pretty nice house
for a compulsive gambler.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.308
[BO] Pretty nice change of topic.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.484
Hi. Sorry to bother you,
but we're here to see--

14:22.571 --> 14:26.155
Roger. Of course. Welcome.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.571
Thank you.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.828
--Just in time to party.
--Though we're a tad bit underdressed.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.459
Oh, whiskey. Thank you.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.632
Classy.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.630
Unlike, say, boinking peeps to death?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.463
--Touché.
--So, where's Mayer's big winner?

14:50.557 --> 14:54.049
Ah, Kenzi...

14:54.144 --> 14:57.352
This isn't a "party" party.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.564
Here he is.

15:08.658 --> 15:12.901
The guest of honour, my Roger.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.159
He looks... peaceful.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.207
And really, really dead.

15:20.087 --> 15:24.126
[SOBBING]

15:25.592 --> 15:28.208
When did he bite it?

15:28.303 --> 15:32.296
Two days ago. Excuse me.

15:33.934 --> 15:38.223
That was twenty-four hours before he
walked into Mayer's and placed a bet.

15:38.313 --> 15:43.728
Yeah, no kidding. Mayer was
wrong. Roger wasn't unlucky.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.936
No. He was a bloody miracle.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.212
You didn't eat one of
those toadstools, did you?

16:06.299 --> 16:11.714
No. But riddle me this--how does a dead
guy walk around town placing bets?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.547
I mean, I've heard gambling's
an addiction, but come on.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.225
A dead human walking? Uh oh.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.269
What? Fae Zombies?

16:21.356 --> 16:25.599
The Chinese call them Hsien.
We call them body jumpers.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.902
They can inhabit a recently dead
human just by touching them.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.069
What, like a ghost?

16:30.157 --> 16:34.446
Well, except they have bodies, but
they don't like them. Nasty bastards.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.901
Well, what's so bad about that?

16:35.996 --> 16:40.615
It's distasteful. Humans are
for feeding off of, not wearing.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.701
Ha. That's funny.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.751
It's what I do.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.084
That's your third energy drink
and you still look like shit.

16:52.179 --> 16:57.299
Hale, she is relentless. This is
the first break I've had all week.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.806
I can manage, brother. Thanks, though.

17:05.901 --> 17:12.192
Clearly. Listen, what's it
like with a succubus? Tell me.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.613
You remember Daphne?

17:13.700 --> 17:14.985
--The nymph?
--Uh huh.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.941
Hourly, yes.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.825
Well, I lost her number
and I don't even care.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.126
Damn.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.297
[BO] Hey. We were just
talking about you.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.123
ReaHy?

17:32.219 --> 17:36.633
Yes. I was saying that if
anyone in town knows a Hsein--

17:36.723 --> 17:38.964
Hsein?

17:39.059 --> 17:42.643
God, for a bunch of far-out fairy folk,
you guys are pretty judgemental.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.313
I know Hsein, our side.
Works as a morgue attendant.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.357
There. Was that so hard, huh?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.985
Do you want my help or not?

17:53.073 --> 17:56.861
Of course. Never know when I might
get injured on an investigation.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.159
Need a little healing.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.077
What about rule number two?

18:01.164 --> 18:03.746
Come on, Dyson.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.540
Rules are meant to be broken.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.368
Later, Kenzi.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.333
Yeah. How did that taste, baby?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.338
Looks like you owe me
fifty bucks, buddy.

18:16.429 --> 18:22.265
Consider yourself schooled. Don't
play pool with une petit hustler.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.602
[whistling]

18:27.524 --> 18:33.019
Here's my free lesson--
Don't play pool with a Siren.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.354
Was it something I sang?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.699
Okay, okay, okay.

18:36.783 --> 18:41.573
Hey, look, if you're bringing a
human act here into Fae world,

18:41.663 --> 18:44.279
--you'll need to nut up.
--Y'a|l don't play fair.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.457
Right. But in your world,
people always do the right things.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.206
The good side always wins
and the nice guy gets the girl.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.207
And what's your point?

18:51.298 --> 18:55.382
My point is that you have to show
people that you can handle your shit.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.460
That you're more than just a sidekick.

18:58.555 --> 19:04.767
I don't give a rat's ass what
any of you think, only Bo.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.722
[HALE] Oooh.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.353
Better.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.084
Eddie. What is it with
the blondes, man?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.965
Oh, don't even start playing.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.092
I'm not looking. Get back in there.

19:43.183 --> 19:47.096
I'm not playing. Get back in.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.098
Awww!

19:49.189 --> 19:52.022
Dyson .

19:52.108 --> 19:53.689
Hey, who's the dame?

19:53.777 --> 19:57.520
Dame? What, did someone
from 1932 follow us in?

19:57.614 --> 20:00.777
Bo, meet Eddie. Light Fae.

20:00.867 --> 20:06.282
Likes to wear corpses around and
gets himself in all kinds of trouble.

20:06.373 --> 20:12.790
Remember those Elvis sightings in
the '70s? Yeah, that was all Eddie.

20:12.879 --> 20:13.789
Congrats.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.713
Cured now. Learning to
appreciate my own body.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.336
You know what the
twelve steps taught me?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.171
I gotta call my sponsor.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.305
You really crossed the wrong guy
this time. Mayer's apoplectic.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.057
Seriously pissed.

20:31.147 --> 20:36.642
"Mayer" Mayer? I'd never deal with
the Dark. Come on, Scout's honour.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.476
Honour's never been
your strong suit, Eddie.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.028
I swear on my mama's sacred skin.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.903
Come on. You know how our
people keep tabs on everyone?

20:43.993 --> 20:46.655
Like across party lines?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.828
Rumour has it Lucas is in town.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.030
Who's Lucas?

20:50.125 --> 20:54.710
Dark Fae Hsien. Very nasty fellow.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.334
Makes Eddie's transgressions
look positively PG.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.210
That's sweet.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.086
Where is he? The real Lucas?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.509
You know the deal,
you want to find a real Hsien--

21:03.596 --> 21:05.552
You find his real body.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.264
Time to break the bad news to Mayer.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.843
You're on your own. I can't
enter Dark Fae territory.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.474
Oh, come on.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.936
Feh!

21:18.027 --> 21:21.190
A [Yiddish] body jumper in my house?

21:21.281 --> 21:27.242
If somebody hired a Hsien to bring
me down, I want to know who, ASAP!

21:27.328 --> 21:31.367
He didn't bring you down,
you just got stiffed, literally.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.700
Stop hockin' me a chinick. I
don't talk business with humans.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.126
No, you just gobble up
their cash and luck.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.705
I got played out of serious
bank, two hundred thou,

21:40.800 --> 21:43.382
earmarked for my Fae bosses.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.588
If I don't nip this in the bud,
I'm chopped liver. Plowed under.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.388
--What, they'd kill you?
--No, no, no.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.138
I hate to think of what
they'll do to my family.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.641
Are you picking?
Were you born in a barn?

21:55.732 --> 21:58.599
--I have allergies.
--Get out of here!

22:00.904 --> 22:04.988
Bo? Could you ask Mayer who
would want to ruin his reputation?

22:05.074 --> 22:07.656
I mean, he's such an
enchanting guy, I can't imagine.

22:07.744 --> 22:12.659
I've been losing a lot of business to a
backroom gamer named Jesper Salming.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.956
Professional rival?
Always a worthy suspect.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.908
I can't get you an invitation.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.120
--I generally don't need one.
--[Mayer] But here's his address.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.133
Well, thank damn I'm here.

22:25.220 --> 22:29.759
Can't just walk into an underground
gambling den and get the kingpin to talk.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.305
A little giggle, a little
tongue down his throat

22:31.392 --> 22:33.428
and I can probably make him ice skate.

22:33.520 --> 22:38.685
Magic hoo-hah aside, backroom poker
is complicated. Almost ceremonial.

22:38.775 --> 22:43.189
I should know, my dad would spend hours
playing. Taught me everything I know.

22:45.198 --> 22:51.285
If we do this, go in, how
do I know I can trust you?

22:51.371 --> 22:54.989
Bo, are you serious?

22:55.083 --> 22:56.163
Wha?

22:56.251 --> 23:02.121
See! That was a bluff, huh.
How do you like my poker face?

23:02.215 --> 23:06.709
Oh, it's on, bitch. Ante up.

23:28.575 --> 23:35.572
Backroom poker's like golf on meth.
And, baby, I'm getting a contact high.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.334
Dude, I could rule this game.

23:41.421 --> 23:45.039
Check out the cougar, she plays
with her straw every time she bluffs.

23:45.133 --> 23:45.918
So?

23:46.009 --> 23:48.170
What the players subconsciously
do each time they bluff

23:48.261 --> 23:50.001
or when they know
they got the goods?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.427
That's their tell.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.927
Learn someone's tell, then you can
always learn their next move.

23:55.018 --> 23:59.261
Thank you, Rainman. But keep your
eyes open. Take note of the exits.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.266
I'll talk to the players. See if
they've seen anything weird

24:01.357 --> 24:02.938
like an empty body lying around.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.062
And I'll find Jesper.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.780
Unless he finds me first.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.362
Okay, I'm out. Remember the signal?

24:17.457 --> 24:19.072
Back in fifteen or I fake a seizure.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.123
That's my girl.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.101
You're a collector?

24:44.192 --> 24:49.107
Wow. These paintings are incredible.

24:49.197 --> 24:52.735
I took it from a twelfth-century
French chateau.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.077
Do you always take what you want?

24:55.161 --> 24:59.404
I'm not above using
force when necessary.

24:59.499 --> 25:05.244
You are easily the most
beautiful piece in here.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.829
Well, wait until you see the rest of me.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.795
Hey. I'm Mighty Mario.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.504
--Oh. Is that so?
--Yeah.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.339
Well, hello.

25:18.434 --> 25:21.801
Cowboy Hat, he yawns
when he's bluffing.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.683
Talking for two minutes, you
already figured out his tell, huh?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.765
That's pretty good.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.645
I call.

25:31.572 --> 25:37.989
Hey, Hot Box. Looks like I got my
lucky charm for the night, huh?

25:38.079 --> 25:42.118
You should check out Pit Stains, he bites
his nails when he knows he's toast.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.039
--No kidding, huh?
--Yeah.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.210
--|t's cold in here.
--|'|| keep you warm.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.471
So, where's the body, Jesper, huh?

26:06.566 --> 26:08.352
--Hm?
--Where's the Hsien?

26:08.443 --> 26:10.183
What Hsien?

26:10.278 --> 26:13.190
The one you're using
to take down Mayer.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.488
Mayer took me for
everything I had at the track,

26:15.575 --> 26:19.193
so if you're taking him down, I want in.

26:19.287 --> 26:25.499
All I know is that you are
one powerful succubus.

26:25.585 --> 26:26.665
What?

26:26.753 --> 26:32.999
Twenty years from now, when you've
really learned to channel your power,

26:33.092 --> 26:37.677
I would not be able to resist you...

26:37.764 --> 26:40.676
even knowing that
you are spying on me.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.098
Who told you I was coming?

26:42.185 --> 26:46.804
What does it matter?
You're not leaving.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.101
--[JESPER] Oh, my.
--Then you won't mind telling me

26:53.196 --> 26:54.231
who robbed Mayer?

26:54.322 --> 26:58.565
Why would I bother to
eliminate that low-level bookie?

27:00.286 --> 27:02.368
'Cause you're clearly
such a reasonable guy.

27:02.455 --> 27:08.075
You have no idea what I am.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.545
I didn't peg you for frigid.

27:12.632 --> 27:18.252
You will be one beautiful, cold corpse.

27:19.555 --> 27:22.262
[BO screaming]

27:26.354 --> 27:28.561
someone DGGdS a manicure.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.731
Woo, baby. Got the backdoor flush!

27:31.818 --> 27:34.150
--Yeah! Alright!
--Oh my god, that's beautiful!

27:34.237 --> 27:36.569
Read 'em and weep, boss.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.817
Bo, is that a signal?

27:38.908 --> 27:40.614
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Look at this.

27:40.701 --> 27:44.319
Pit Stains--he just shoved an
ace up his sleeve. Is that bad?

27:44.413 --> 27:46.995
Son of a bitch! He's a cheat.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.498
[KENZI] Alright.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.127
Eat crowbar!

28:06.018 --> 28:07.554
Okay.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.641
Dude, you're like an icicle.

28:13.442 --> 28:14.272
Do you know the way out?

28:14.360 --> 28:18.273
Yeah, turn left at
Mario and then book it.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.276
Bye-bye, retirement fund.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.574
Bo, Bo.

28:27.039 --> 28:31.624
--[HALE] Eat my ball.
--[KENZI] Yo! 911 booty call, like, now.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.043
Better down another espresso.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.961
[DYSON] Help me with her.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.208
[HALE] Come on. Come on.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.915
[DYSON] Hold on, Bo.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.299
--You got her?
--I got her.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.006
God, what the hell did
you do to yourself?

28:49.770 --> 28:50.850
You're freezing.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.145
Rule three--no questions, remember?

28:53.232 --> 28:56.224
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stay
with me. What did he look like?

28:56.319 --> 29:00.232
Big. European. Terrible kisser.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.655
Agh! Agh!

29:02.742 --> 29:06.985
His hands frosted over.
He was cold as hell.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.571
It's Hrimthurs--it's a Frost Giant.
Their touch can stop a man's heart.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.655
You could have been killed.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.538
You really, really need to
work on your foreplay.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.335
Is that a new rule?

29:16.422 --> 29:18.378
Just good manners.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.755
Don't hold back. Take what you need.

29:36.359 --> 29:39.897
[thumping]

29:39.987 --> 29:46.574
So, uh, seen any movies
late--lately, or...

29:46.661 --> 29:48.117
No.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.371
Did my troll get out?

29:52.458 --> 29:55.950
Bo and Dyson, just talking.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.410
[glass breaking]

29:57.505 --> 30:01.589
You know, a lot of meeting. Just...

30:02.802 --> 30:05.293
Lots of talking.

30:07.056 --> 30:10.048
Red Cross ain't got nothing on you.

30:10.142 --> 30:14.260
Hey. Hey, you okay?

30:14.355 --> 30:16.437
It's not as bad as it looks.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.109
Shit.

30:22.196 --> 30:25.233
--So much for keeping our secret.
--Yeah, sorry about that.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.317
[KENZI] Bo. Oh my god, not a scratch.

30:29.412 --> 30:34.281
Dude, your junk could cure cancer.
Though you look kind of green.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.785
I'm a quarter leprechaun.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.743
[KENZI] Really? Listen,
what are we going to do next,

30:38.838 --> 30:40.294
now that we know that
Jesper was tipped off

30:40.381 --> 30:42.747
by someone who worked for Mayer?
[cell phone ringing]

30:42.842 --> 30:47.131
Dyson. Eddie, calm down, man.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.133
Who's there?

30:50.224 --> 30:52.306
Eddie?

30:52.393 --> 30:55.180
It went dead. Morgue.

30:55.271 --> 30:59.765
--Not really dressed for it.
--He|lo? Mayer snitch? Anyone?

30:59.859 --> 31:03.522
Yeah, you guys go. Yeah, I got this.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.696
Left behind again?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.613
Want to shoot some stick?

31:11.704 --> 31:15.538
Sorry, Hale. I got my own shit to solve.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.871
Getting better.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.432
Goon-mobile, check.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.521
Bumbling idiot, check.

32:14.016 --> 32:17.554
Holy honey pot. Oh!

32:22.483 --> 32:26.396
Hey. Hey, I took too much, didn't I?

32:28.030 --> 32:31.363
No. You took what you had to.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.906
[BO] Where is he?

32:41.127 --> 32:42.742
Eddie?

32:46.132 --> 32:47.747
[DYSON] Eddie!

32:50.386 --> 32:54.470
Dyson. What up, brother?

32:54.557 --> 32:57.390
--He|lo.
--Are you okay?

32:57.476 --> 33:00.468
Never better. So, what up?

33:00.563 --> 33:03.896
You called me. Sounded like
you were going to soil yourself.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.564
You said, "He's here."

33:05.651 --> 33:07.892
--Yeah, he was.
--Lucas?

33:07.987 --> 33:09.477
Yeah, my fellow Hsien.

33:09.572 --> 33:14.487
Wanted to know if I'd been
talking to that succubus.

33:14.577 --> 33:18.411
He really doesn't like you
sniffing in his business.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.284
But that's okay. I scared
him off, though.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.582
--You did?
--Yeah.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.957
You know, I've learned some
interesting things in the past few days.

33:28.674 --> 33:33.043
That Fae can be bookies.
That body jumpers exist.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.593
That people often have a
tell when they're bluffing.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.891
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?

33:50.529 --> 33:52.815
Eddie's not here anymore, is he?

33:54.283 --> 33:56.444
No.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.991
[DYSON] No!

34:00.539 --> 34:01.995
Bo!

34:03.876 --> 34:05.457
It's locked.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.627
Go. I got this.

34:08.714 --> 34:13.083
Ah! Ah! Arrggh!

34:15.387 --> 34:19.801
I know you can onlyjump bodies
by touching them, Lucas.

34:19.892 --> 34:24.386
So, come easy or make this hard, but
either way, this is the end of the line.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.527
Is that the best you got, huh?

34:45.251 --> 34:47.082
I'm just warming up.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.392
Let's dance.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.512
Bring it, juice monkey.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.561
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

35:10.317 --> 35:12.854
When you're dead, I'm going to
wear your corpse like a coat.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.901
I'm calling PETA.

35:17.491 --> 35:21.404
Then, I'm gonna rip Dyson to
itty-bitty pieces. Using your hands.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.235
Speaking of itty-bitty...

35:23.330 --> 35:24.831
[crunching sound]

35:28.502 --> 35:29.912
[roaring]

35:42.725 --> 35:44.716
No more bodies within reach.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.098
I pull this trigger, you are as
dead as the one you are in.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.359
What the hell took you so long?

35:59.325 --> 36:03.113
Who paid you to take down
Mayer? Where's his money?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.114
Somewhere you'll never find it.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.121
Whatever.

36:10.002 --> 36:16.293
We got all the time in
the world, unlike you.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.125
I can already smell that
corpse starting to rot.

36:19.219 --> 36:23.212
A few more hours, it'll be so decomposed,
you won't be able to stay in it.

36:26.727 --> 36:31.471
If you don't get back to
your own body soon, Lucas,

36:31.565 --> 36:36.275
you'll be worm food. Like all
of your little human puppets.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.445
Or hey, how about I lock you in
one of those body drawers, huh?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.271
That's a hell of a way to
spend your final hours.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.655
He forced me into Roger's corpse.
Fixed the bet at Mayer's.

36:44.745 --> 36:48.784
Said if I didn't trick that old bookie,
I wouldn't get my body back.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.160
"He" who, Lucas?

36:54.713 --> 36:59.798
...expensive card game
going here tonight...

36:59.885 --> 37:03.798
This is Lucas, your body jumper.
He's here to tell us who ripped you off.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.129
He better.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.885
[BO] So, you gonna let us in?

37:06.975 --> 37:10.183
You, yes. Him, no.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.885
I can't enter without his permission.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.972
We work for different sides. I don't
want him knowing my business.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.524
And I don't want the Ash
knowing that I was involved in it.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.523
So you both stay quiet,
everybody wins.

37:23.117 --> 37:25.199
On your blood honour?

37:28.914 --> 37:32.873
Bad peace is better than good war.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.673
What's with the meat delivery?

37:45.764 --> 37:48.506
Don't you recognize your good
buddy, Lucas, huh, Seymour?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.760
The jig is up.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.308
You?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.098
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.178
Can't be.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.731
[LUCAS] Believe it, pal.
Seymour and his buddy hired me.

37:57.818 --> 38:00.525
--My real body's in his car.
--[SEYMOUR] Stupid corpse jockey.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.523
This wouldn't have happened
if you weren't so stupid.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.195
Ah, pot, meet kettle.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.398
[Yiddish]

38:05.492 --> 38:10.111
--You never let me do anything.
--My sister's only son?

38:10.205 --> 38:14.414
I taught you everything,
but common sense.

38:14.501 --> 38:17.368
Three hundred years.
You finally grow a backbone

38:17.463 --> 38:21.081
and you can only use it
to usurp your own uncle?

38:21.175 --> 38:22.961
All I wanted was some respect.

38:23.051 --> 38:28.136
Respect? You're dead to me.

38:30.726 --> 38:33.934
I guess I'll go collect
the body of evidence?

38:40.694 --> 38:42.150
In there?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.448
Kenzi!

38:50.162 --> 38:53.654
I've really got to pee.
Please don't tell Bo I'm here.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.952
[DYSON] Back in your body, Lucas.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.293
Well, that's new.

39:06.094 --> 39:09.006
You're welcome.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.053
And as for you...

39:13.852 --> 39:15.262
What is this, a blind date gone bad?

39:15.354 --> 39:18.517
Yeah, that's right, mock the human,
'cause that's not getting old.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.347
None of you take me seriously,

39:20.442 --> 39:23.434
okay, except Bo. And I
want to keep it that way.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.611
Then I won't mention
this little debacle.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.029
Right. Then I won't tell her
how much it hurts you

39:28.116 --> 39:30.277
every time you two are together.

39:30.369 --> 39:34.829
Yeah, I noticed. But we
both know it's worth it.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.117
What, are you back on Team Dyson?

39:40.212 --> 39:41.998
You wish.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.580
Come on, we're getting t-shirts.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.468
--[BO] Kenzi.
--Hey.

39:57.563 --> 40:01.147
--What are you doing here?
--He texted. We text.

40:01.233 --> 40:04.691
Yeah, you know. Backup.

40:08.073 --> 40:08.858
Weirdo.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.691
Oh, he's not so bad.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.652
I was talking about you, freak.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.203
So, Seymour, huh?

40:17.291 --> 40:21.660
He's a traitor. My own flesh and blood.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.913
[BO] What are you
going to do with him?

40:23.005 --> 40:25.337
[MAYER] Put him somewhere
safe, what else?

40:25.424 --> 40:27.540
You're more familiar with the Light.

40:27.634 --> 40:32.003
My side, we don't believe in mercy.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.213
He's family.

40:34.308 --> 40:37.766
So, you promise not to tell,
I'll let you see the oracle.

40:37.853 --> 40:42.096
"Let", my balls, buddy. That was the
first deal, she made good on it.

40:42.190 --> 40:46.354
You want Bo to keep your little secret?
That's a whole new shebang.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.686
What do you want?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.691
I'll take the debt.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.740
You never know when I might need
to collect on your blood honour.

40:53.827 --> 40:57.285
You're not too bad for a succubus.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.205
Not so bad yourself,
considering you're Dark Fae.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.624
So join us.

41:02.711 --> 41:05.293
I'm not picking sides.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.417
At least not until I find
out about my parents.

41:10.552 --> 41:12.588
Cassie's in the back.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.153
I'd like to feed off you.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.782
I'd make a bad snack.
Never had much luck.

41:39.873 --> 41:43.457
You taste like a survivor.

41:43.543 --> 41:48.833
But if I can't eat you, maybe I
can use you. If you need a job.

41:48.924 --> 41:51.666
I got a job, but thanks.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.135
Let's do it.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.024
A girl.

42:10.112 --> 42:13.946
Your mother. Betrayed by
the one she loved the most.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.819
But she escaped after all those years.

42:16.910 --> 42:20.823
Searching, yearning
for her child. For you.

42:20.914 --> 42:24.372
She will be coming.
There will be a battle.

42:24.459 --> 42:27.826
Death. You will have to choose.

42:27.921 --> 42:33.166
She's coming. She's coming!
She's coming, she's coming!

42:33.260 --> 42:36.002
I'm gonna ralph!

42:38.557 --> 42:41.640
What was that? Because
that was not my memory.

42:41.727 --> 42:45.140
No duh.

42:45.230 --> 42:49.018
Do not tell anyone that just happened.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.645
What does it mean?

42:50.736 --> 42:54.320
You're a major player.

42:54.406 --> 42:58.274
Fate has some serious plans for you.

43:02.998 --> 43:04.784
Later.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.286
So?

43:14.968 --> 43:17.425
It was a long shot.

43:17.512 --> 43:20.345
Maybe it's better not knowing.
Family... It's complicated.

43:20.432 --> 43:24.550
Kenzi, she's alive.

43:26.855 --> 43:29.392
My mother's alive.
