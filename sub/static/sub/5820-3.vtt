00:01.040 --> 00:03.360
( Horn blaring )

00:03.560 --> 00:06.404
( panting )

00:15.320 --> 00:16.401
Try again.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.291
Tobin, it's not stopping.
Light it up. You hear me?

00:19.440 --> 00:21.124
( Static crackling )

00:21.280 --> 00:23.203
- Tobin!
- ( walker snarling )

00:23.360 --> 00:25.044
- Michonne.
- Got it.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.606
Shit! Shit!
It was half.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.125
Jesus, it was more than half.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.691
We just gotta stay ahead of them.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.450
They walk, we run.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.250
- Daryl on radio: Rick!
- I'm here.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.561
What's going on back there?

00:37.760 --> 00:39.603
Rick:
Half of them broke off.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.410
They're going toward Alexandria.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.604
Towards you?

00:46.760 --> 00:49.127
We ran ahead.
There's a horn or something.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.760
Loud, coming from the east.
It's not stopping.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.082
I'm gonna gas it up,
turn back.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.647
Rick:
We have it. You keep going.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.086
They're gonna need
our help.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.282
Gotta keep
the herd moving.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.930
Daryl: Not if it's going down,
we don't.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.610
The rest of that herd
turns around,

01:03.760 --> 01:05.444
the bad back there gets worse.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.602
Daryl?

01:09.760 --> 01:11.285
Yeah, I heard you.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.850
( High-pitched whine )

01:20.000 --> 01:22.446
Nicholas.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.120
- Ah!
- You okay,'

01:25.280 --> 01:27.282
It's my ankle.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.131
All right, come on.
Grab on. Let's go.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.805
Come on.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.849
It's coming
from back home.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.968
- It has to be.
- He did this.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.964
He brought us all out here to die.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.128
- He killed Carter.
- Carter was dead already.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.965
Now they're in trouble
back there and we're done.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.004
- We're good as dead.
- Hey, calm down.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.491
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:48.640 --> 01:51.211
We are done.
And it's 'cause of him.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.522
Shut up and move.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.648
Come on.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.725
Damn it.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.804
All right, listen up.
Here's the new plan.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.123
I go back, get the RV,
circle around the woods on Redding.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.009
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.491
I can lead them away again.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.404
RV's a mile back.
I can go with you.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.403
I'll handle it.
Just get home.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.164
They might need you there.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.369
Glenn, Michonne.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.524
If something's in front of you,
you kill it.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.842
No hiding, no waiting.
You keep going.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.849
I'm going with you.
You can't do this on your own.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.883
- Glenn, I can do this.
- You need to help me.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.486
- We've got to get these people back.
- Yeah.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.167
Thing is, they aren't all
gonna make it.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.368
- Rick.
- You try to save them, you try,

02:41.520 --> 02:43.727
but they can't keep up,
you keep going.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.770
You have to.
You make sure you get back.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.042
- ( Man screams )
- ( walkers snarling )

02:54.920 --> 02:56.922
( screaming )

02:57.080 --> 02:59.162
Oh, God!

03:00.400 --> 03:02.402
Oh, God!

03:07.520 --> 03:09.841
(gurgling )

03:18.920 --> 03:22.766
( horn continues blaring )

03:22.920 --> 03:24.410
( horn stops )

03:24.560 --> 03:27.245
Rick:
The horn stopped. Good.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.088
Get back safe.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.604
( Theme music playing )

04:35.480 --> 04:38.131
Glenn:
We're ahead of it. 10 minutes.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.124
20 minutes, maybe.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.126
We all keep up the pace,
we all get back home.

04:45.280 --> 04:49.444
So if we don't, that's it, huh?

04:49.640 --> 04:51.324
Sturgess: We don't even know
what's waiting for us.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.051
David: It's gonna be okay.
We have walls for a reason.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.851
That sound. Maybe someone plowed
right through.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.411
Maybe we're walking
back to nothing.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.847
Shh, my wife's back there.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.568
Mine, too.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.326
Look, don't worry
about what's gone wrong.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.244
Figure out how
to make this go right.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.051
We're moving in the same direction
everything else is.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.531
We're gonna catch up
with something.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.364
We're gonna catch up
with a lot of things

05:15.520 --> 05:17.568
and we're gonna end them.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.643
We have no choice.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.848
We gotta keep going forward.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.401
( Walkers snarling )

05:36.680 --> 05:38.569
Stay here.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.609
Don't shoot
unless you have to.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.366
Come on. That's us.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.931
<i>'</i> ( Gunshots )
' ( groans )

06:25.400 --> 06:26.811
Glenn:
Sturgess!

06:56.920 --> 06:58.968
(groaning )

07:01.480 --> 07:04.165
- ( growling )
- ( screams )

07:24.000 --> 07:26.480
I know what it means.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.008
We gotta keep moving, right?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.685
Hey, we gone
five miles out yet?

07:40.840 --> 07:43.844
Give or take some yardage.
You got a reason for asking?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.810
Next intersection we're gonna
spin around and go back.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.849
The plan
is to go 15 more.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.685
Yeah, I'm gonna change that.
Five's gonna have to work.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.367
The magic number's 20.
That's the mission.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.364
That's making sure they're off munching
on infirm raccoons

07:58.520 --> 08:00.887
the rest of their undead lives
instead of any of us.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.526
Sasha: You want to go,
we can't stop you.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.365
But without you,
they could stop us.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.441
Nah, I got faith in you.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.682
- Sasha: Daryl!
- Abraham: Don't do it, man!

09:06.600 --> 09:08.489
- Can I take a look?
- Please?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.565
Is it bad?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.402
- It's about what you'd expect.
- Huh, didn't expect this.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.763
How long you been married?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.611
Three months.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.569
She wasn't my wife
from before.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.802
How'd you meet?

09:34.120 --> 09:37.488
It was early on.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.808
Aaron found me.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.770
I was alone,
lost everything.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.287
Everyone.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.762
Myself, I--
I wasn't crazy.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.130
I just gave up
on being someone,

09:53.320 --> 09:55.448
an actual person.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.365
Know what I mean?

09:58.520 --> 10:01.205
I do.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.251
We found Betsy on the way back
to the community.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.530
She still saw me.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.489
After I thought
I was dead and gone,

10:11.640 --> 10:13.847
she was my first friend.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.321
Then she was more.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.721
She made me more.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.850
Even better than howl used to be.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.449
But if I could make it back,
I'd want to say good-bye.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.450
Tell her...

10:29.600 --> 10:33.047
finding her in all this,

10:33.200 --> 10:35.601
that was everything.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.487
We need to stop
and bandage him up.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.361
No, we keep moving.
I'm okay.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.807
You won't be if we don't
stop your bleeding.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.689
We'll find a place.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.406
Can't stop out
in the open too long.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.845
Come on.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.610
Let's check if these cars work first,
see if they can get us back.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.842
I'll stay with them.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.965
( Hammer clicks )

11:38.840 --> 11:42.049
Listen, I need to get home,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.521
but I'm not leaving them behind.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.610
We patch Scott up,
we get going.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.366
Rick knows
what he knows.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.130
We're ahead of the herd.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.169
Maybe half an hour now.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.642
We can stop.
We can make it.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.131
Mm-hmm.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.811
This is halfway home, right?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.644
Yeah.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.681
This is where it happened.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.811
I said it at the dealership.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.241
Me and Aiden didn't know
what we were doing.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.563
The people
on your crew who died?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.369
They weren't afraid.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.329
We were.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.210
Glenn:
No luck.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.368
We have to stay on foot.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.489
Nicholas was here last.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.688
He can show us the way.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.330
Uh, okay.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.283
All right.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.002
Glenn:
There's no cars.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.561
<i>L</i> 9011 you.
<i>I</i> 9011 you.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.689
Oh, Jesus.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.604
<i>Sturgess'?</i>

13:24.960 --> 13:26.724
He left us behind.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.048
( Crunching )

13:51.040 --> 13:54.044
( high-pitched whine )

14:04.600 --> 14:06.568
Herd's that way.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.164
Shit.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.202
- Nicholas.
- Uh...

14:27.560 --> 14:29.164
( lock clicks )

15:04.480 --> 15:06.084
We stay quiet,

15:06.240 --> 15:09.403
patch Scott and Annie up,
get out of here.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.484
Those walkers in the alley
and down the street,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.808
they're blocking
the way out of town.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.646
We can't take 'em on,
not in the shape that we're in.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.485
We'll have to lead them away
if we have to.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.802
Because that's been
working well lately.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.728
I'm trying here.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.723
I'm not giving up.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.326
Yeah, not yet.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.444
Hey, I was thinking,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.001
if we can find a way to distract
the herd coming in,

15:42.160 --> 15:43.810
then they won't make it
back to the community.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.081
How?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.163
Burn one
of the buildings.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.970
Hopefully more.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.088
They'll get drawn to it
and they'll stop here.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.129
It's gonna take
some time.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.248
I'll do it.
You stay with them.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.323
It's my plan.
It's on me.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.687
You have a wife, Glenn.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.207
That's why I'm doing this.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.124
You've got to get everybody back.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.408
You're the one who can.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.642
If I take too long,
you just go.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.768
I'm not leaving without you.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.890
- That is not the way this works.
- I will meet you there.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.283
If I get stuck out here, I'll find
some way to show you guys I'm okay.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.842
We all have a job to do.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.371
There's a feed store.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.524
It's old.
A lot of dry stuff inside.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.170
It should go up easy.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.926
I'll go with you.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.009
I can--
I can draw a map.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.527
No.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.887
You lead the way.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.371
Just gotta do one thing first.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.644
( Static hissing )

17:17.319 --> 17:19.482
( crunching )

17:22.720 --> 17:25.564
Glenn on radio:
Rick, it's Glenn.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.644
We're in a town five degrees east
of the green marker.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.644
If you get around on Redding in the next
20 minutes, you should be good.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.962
I think that's how far
we're ahead of the herd.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.488
I'm gonna try to set a fire
and distract them.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.450
If you don't see smoke,
they're still coming your way.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.568
<i>L</i> Qot to go.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.563
Good luck, dumb-ass.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.882
( Panting )

18:18.320 --> 18:20.721
( ragged breathing )

18:31.080 --> 18:35.051
Heath: That'll keep you going
until we get you back to the infirmary.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.283
Annie, I'm gonna
figure out a crutch for you.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.841
Just leave me.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.764
What?

18:44.480 --> 18:46.403
I'm slowing you down.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.001
We're gonna hit more roamers.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.889
It's that simple.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.963
Leave me.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.646
Leave us.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.684
No.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.605
It's stupid for you guys
to wait on me.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.330
We'll all go down.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.083
Scott:
Come on, man, wake up.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.049
You don't want to do it now,

19:10.200 --> 19:12.567
you do it out there.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.883
We get into trouble
again, you run.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.362
- And you don't look back.
- No, if we go, we go together.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.763
We got each other's backs
just like always.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.129
Okay, we don't leave
people behind.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.964
Not us.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.767
No one is leaving
anyone behind.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.527
I'm gonna find something
for you, Annie.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.369
<i>He'! '</i>

20:03.520 --> 20:05.204
Do you have
a problem with me?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.848
I'm just looking out
for my people.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.766
And you think that I'm not?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.882
Look, I heard what Rick said.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.329
Which part?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.249
How they wouldn't all make it.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.166
They meaning us and not you.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.051
How you should leave us behind
if we can't keep up.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.522
Glenn is out there risking his life
for you and for everyone else

20:37.680 --> 20:40.843
and I'm still here, so I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.287
Things are gonna get worse
and then we'll see.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.920
Yeah, we will.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.122
Rick said what he said

20:52.280 --> 20:55.045
because sometimes
you don't have a choice.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.770
That is not how we do it.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.048
Because you've never had
to do it any other way.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.531
- ( Scoffs )
- You haven't been through it,

21:00.680 --> 21:03.411
- Michonne--
- not really. Not like Rick.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.564
Rick was out there.
I was out there.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.404
We know, you don't.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.608
But if you don't learn,
you will die, we will.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.569
I've been doing runs
from the start, okay?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.882
- I know what it's like.
- Have you ever had to kill people

21:15.080 --> 21:17.208
because they'd already killed your
friends and were coming for you next?

21:17.360 --> 21:21.046
Have you ever done things that made you
feel afraid of yourself afterward?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.680
Have you ever been
covered in so much blood

21:23.880 --> 21:27.043
that you didn't know if it was yours
or walkers' or your friends'?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.965
Huh?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.805
Then you don't know.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.683
(walker snarling )

22:04.880 --> 22:06.803
Wait.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.325
It should be me.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.808
He was on my crew.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.884
His name was Will.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.566
He was 19.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.245
We left him behind.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.847
You're not that guy anymore.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.291
Hey, you are here now.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.488
You are not
that guy anymore.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.443
Okay.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.767
( Distant gunfire )

23:07.920 --> 23:09.649
Shit.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.370
Is that home?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.409
We need to go now.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.689
Heath:
Okay. Okay, let's go.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.080
Come on.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.241
( Distant gunfire )

23:24.400 --> 23:26.482
We gotta go now.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.246
( Walkers snarling )

23:29.400 --> 23:31.448
( distant gunfire )

23:34.880 --> 23:38.407
( snarling )

23:38.600 --> 23:40.887
Michonne: The ones from down
the street and in the alley,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.247
they're getting drawn
by the gunfire.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.568
( Gunfire continues )

23:55.600 --> 23:58.649
Soon as they clear,
we head for the feed store.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.451
Till then we sit tight,
keep quiet.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.402
( Panting )

24:17.920 --> 24:18.921
(grunts)

( snarling )

26:18.920 --> 26:21.287
( clattering )

26:22.800 --> 26:24.290
Heath:
They heard that.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.720
Heath: They know we're in here now.
We can't wait them out.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.281
The herd, it's gonna
be here any minute.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.802
What?

26:50.320 --> 26:52.368
They're coming.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.806
( Snarling )

26:58.960 --> 27:01.167
(gunfire)

27:04.880 --> 27:08.009
Go! Come on!

27:08.160 --> 27:10.242
Where's the feed store?

27:10.440 --> 27:11.487
Go! The other end of town.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.641
- We can try--
- We can't.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.529
Glenn said we got to go.
We go now.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.405
(groaning )

27:20.560 --> 27:21.925
Ah!

27:23.880 --> 27:26.281
Just run!

27:26.440 --> 27:29.683

27:29.840 --> 27:33.686
- ( gun clicks)
- ( screaming )

27:51.280 --> 27:53.601
It's just up ahead.
We light it up and we go.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.921
There's gotta be another building.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.286
- Glenn: We gotta go.
- Um...

28:15.720 --> 28:18.451
- Glenn: Where?!
- Nicholas: Uh, uh...

28:20.320 --> 28:21.890
- Nicholas!
- This way.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.849
- This-- this way.
- Go! Go!

28:32.280 --> 28:35.124
You go over first,
and then we'll help Scott.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.486
No, they're coming.
Just go.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.847
We're doing this.
Come on.

29:12.520 --> 29:16.491
Come on!

- Nicholas: No!
- ( snarling )

29:30.440 --> 29:32.488

31:05.680 --> 31:06.966

31:07.120 --> 31:09.964
We gotta keep going.
We don't have a choice.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.407
We don't have a choice.
Come on!

31:25.200 --> 31:27.282
Up here! Up here!

Come on.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.210
Heath:
There's no smoke.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.562
It doesn't mean
they didn't make it.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.561
The herd's still coming, but this creek
should slow them down some.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.365
Glenn.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.602
I'm in place
by my best guess.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.370
You guys make it back yet?

36:05.520 --> 36:07.409
( Static hissing )

36:09.120 --> 36:11.009

Won't be long now.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.682
They're almost here.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.962
I'll get them going
your way again.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.088
How 'bout that, Daryl?

36:41.240 --> 36:43.527
He's gonna be coming our way.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.922
( Distant gunfire )

36:54.080 --> 36:56.765
There's gunfire
coming from back home.

36:56.920 --> 36:59.924
We gotta sit with it
and hope they can handle it.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.560
I think they can.
They have to.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.883
We keep going forward
for them.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.203
Can't turn back
'cause we're afraid.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.642
We ain't afraid.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.007
Rick:
This is for them.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.482
Going back now before it's done,
that'd be for us.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.611

almost here.
