01:59.620 --> 02:00.686
- Do you have any money?
- Um...

02:00.788 --> 02:02.521
That's okay.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.095
Brandon, look.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.201
Where do you think that is?

02:18.973 --> 02:20.939
It's just a model, Darcy.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.009
It's not a real place.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.978
I bet it's Ireland.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.548
Mom said Christmas is beautiful
in Ireland.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.317
Someday I'll have a Christmas
just like that.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.388
Everything will be perfect.

02:57.111 --> 02:59.178
Okay, Michelangelo,
it's a Christmas card.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.713
- Not the Sistine Chapel.
- It's not done.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.748
You never think it's done,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.683
but it's always gorgeous.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.717
You can touch it up
in Photoshop.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.352
Not the same.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.788
You'll be signing one of these
cards at my funeral.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.224
You could try singing me
a Christmas carol.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.693
It might get me in the mood,
get me to work faster.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.297
Singing is for those
with a joyful inner voice.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.932
I don't have one of those.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.734
Of course you do.
You just need to nurture it.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.436
Mm-hmm,
don't change the subject.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.538
That should have been
to the copywriter an hour ago.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.907
Tom's there until two o'clock
today, I checked.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.042
That's something else
you've been taking

03:30.144 --> 03:31.643
your sweet time with.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.613
It'll happen
if it's supposed to.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.716
Oh, hi, Tom. No one
here was talking about you.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.853
I was just telling Carmen

03:41.956 --> 03:46.592
how I, uh, I-I need to get this
done for you.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.994
- Oh.
- Very soon.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.430
Darcy, I love how much detail
you put in your work.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.198
I can almost
hear those carolers singing.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.735
- It just needs a little more--
- Lil' more shading on the tree.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.138
Yeah, exactly.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.208
Well, perfection
is worth waiting for.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.446
Just drop that in my office
whenever you're done.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.547
Okay.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.215
Carmen.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.123
Okay, you stalled long enough
to get him to come up here.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.690
No, it's really not done.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.827
Perfect is the enemy
of done.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.196
Darcy, tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.430
The official gateway

04:25.532 --> 04:29.034
to the glorious
Christmas season.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.270
During which
you will make yourself crazy

04:31.372 --> 04:33.305
attempting to achieve
the impossible goal

04:33.407 --> 04:34.706
of a perfect Christmas.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.943
Not impossible.
I just haven't done it yet.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.612
I will see you tomorrow.
Five o'clock sharp.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.144
Hey, Brandon. Happy
Thanksgiving. You almost here?

05:12.246 --> 05:13.979
Uh, I'm about
to head into the store.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.814
Tell me again, what kind
of cheese I'm supposed to get.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.383
The gouda kind, the bada kind?

05:18.485 --> 05:20.319
Oh, speaking of cheesy.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.988
<i>- So Kraft Singles then?</i>
- Not funny.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.057
My first-choice cheese
is the herbed goat cheese,

05:25.159 --> 05:27.025
but if they don't have that,
then just get a plain one.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.660
<i> I definitely</i>
<i>do not want a goat cheese</i>

05:28.762 --> 05:30.562
<i>that was rolled in fruit
or something.</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:32.264
If you do get the plain one,
then I want

05:32.366 --> 05:33.899
another herbed cheese

05:34.001 --> 05:35.267
<i>like a-a dill havarti,</i>

05:35.369 --> 05:36.335
<i>but if you get
the herbed cheese,</i>

05:36.437 --> 05:37.369
<i>then I want smoked gouda</i>

05:37.471 --> 05:38.770
<i>for counterpoint.</i>

05:38.872 --> 05:41.106
Darce,
dinner is gonna be great.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.375
Your parents
will get along fine.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.043
Thanks, Brandon. And hurry.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.083
- Darcy, I'm here.
- Hi, mom.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.253
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, hi.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.390
- So who's coming?
- Um, dad, of course.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.293
And Carmen, and Brandon.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.529
When are you going to give
that nice Brandon a chance?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.264
As I've discussed with you
many times,

06:06.367 --> 06:07.966
Brandon and I are just friends.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.868
Better than being alone
coming up on Christmas.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.737
I want more than to just
not be alone.

06:11.839 --> 06:12.938
I want to be
with the right person.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.740
Like my copywriter, Tom.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.808
He appreciates
my attention to detail.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.578
He is the sort of person
I should be with.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.614
You let too many shoulds
run your life, Darcy.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.383
Mom, I know
you're full of opinions,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.084
but you don't actually
have to say them all out loud.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.086
It's how I show that I care.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.454
So did you bring the pie?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.457
Did I what?
Wait till you try these.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.893
This bakery got
a five-star Yelp review.

06:34.995 --> 06:39.297
Oh, uh, I thought you were gonna
make grandma's recipe.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.434
I know, but every year you tell
me I've done something wrong,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.569
so I thought, you know,
if I brought this,

06:44.671 --> 06:47.272
they'd be perfect,
like you want them.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.940
Okay, uh, that's, that's not
what I, I meant, but--

06:49.042 --> 06:50.976
I bring the best pies
in the city

06:51.078 --> 06:52.978
and they're still not
good enough for you.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.413
Fine, I suppose
I'll just throw them away.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.681
No, no, no,
I'm sure it'll be delicious.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.283
- You have great taste.
- Thank you.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.485
Thank you for the pie.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.686
Hey, hey, hey!

07:04.024 --> 07:05.590
Why can you not have
two Thanksgivings

07:05.692 --> 07:07.459
like any other normal child
of divorce?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.127
Because my wonderful parents
are so mature,

07:09.229 --> 07:11.430
they can handle the occasional
holiday meal together.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.267
Hi, dad. Happy Thanksgiving.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.501
I brought
the green-bean casserole.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.638
- I just need to put it together.
- Oh.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.506
Uh, okay.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.010
Bill, you're not helping.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.845
Oh, Darcy doesn't mind.
Do you, kiddo?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.147
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.348
- Hi.
- Hey-hey-hey.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.817
Uh, I got a little more

07:31.919 --> 07:33.618
than you asked for.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.023
- Oh, Brandon. Brandon.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.025
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- How are you?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.160
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.362
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right. Good to see you.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.565
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.172
I have no idea
what she asked for.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.874
Kiddo, is there supposed to be

07:55.976 --> 07:57.609
smoke coming out of the oven?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.979
What? No. No, no, no, no.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.783
- Oh.
- Ooh.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.760
Cheer up, Darce.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.730
It's still delicious.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.732
Well, like 90 percent
of it's delicious, you know?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.001
Holiday disappointment
is inevitable.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.936
Well, if every holiday
went perfectly,

08:25.038 --> 08:26.171
how would we ever
tell them apart?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.607
Oh, I gave up on perfect
years ago.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.675
Every time I try to make
something perfect,

08:30.777 --> 08:32.244
it always turned out wrong.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.279
Oh, like the time
we had spaghetti and meatballs

08:34.381 --> 08:36.280
for Thanksgiving,
because you forgot to mention

08:36.383 --> 08:38.015
that you invited your cousins
to swing by.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.918
Hey, that was fun.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.886
Just as
I'm putting out the turkey

08:41.989 --> 08:43.788
for the three of us,
up rolled an RV

08:43.890 --> 08:46.291
with a dozen starved cousins
expecting dinner.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.893
So, back to the kitchen for me.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.961
That Thanksgiving
was complete chaos.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.396
You two were so mad
at each other.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.431
Well, in those days
it wasn't a holiday

08:53.534 --> 08:55.467
unless we were
at each other's throats.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.236
- Holiday traditions are weird.
- That's not what I meant.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.138
Well, like,
it's just not Christmas for me

09:00.240 --> 09:02.908
without this hideous
inflatable Santa Claus

09:03.010 --> 09:05.377
wearing Bermuda shorts.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.746
I hated it for years, but my dad
thought it was hilarious

09:07.848 --> 09:09.881
and now
it's my Christmas tradition.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.583
For my mother it wasn't
Christmas unless we played

09:11.685 --> 09:13.218
her Christmas album.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.287
She's leaving out
that it is one hundred percent

09:15.389 --> 09:18.323
in Gaelic. No idea
what they were saying. Hah.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.258
And the singing's
a wee bit off-key.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.995
But she loved us, so she
tortured us with it every year.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.232
Bill and I loathed it,
but when she passed,

09:27.334 --> 09:28.767
I couldn't bring myself
to throw it out.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.268
I wish I could have a Christmas
like you did

09:30.370 --> 09:31.570
when you were a kid in Ireland.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.673
They weren't all that great,
Darcy.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.841
It just seems like the way
Christmas should be.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.810
One of my favorite Christmases
gone wrong

09:38.912 --> 09:41.012
was when our flight got grounded
in Buffalo.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.247
When we were on our way home
from--

09:42.349 --> 09:44.316
Yeah, our semester abroad.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.685
We had to sleep on our backpacks

09:46.787 --> 09:48.286
because all the hotels
were full.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.088
And there was no food
because the supply trucks

09:50.190 --> 09:52.123
couldn't get through
the ten feet of snow.

09:52.225 --> 09:56.461
Oh, and the s-stupid Oompah band
kept playing polkas...

09:56.563 --> 09:58.096
It was the worst Christmas ever.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.633
Huh, what? No, come on,
that was like one of my best.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.069
You have a really odd sense
of fun, Brandon.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.108
I just want a perfect holiday.
Just once.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.944
One time
where nothing went wrong.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.647
That's just not real life,
Darcy.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.515
A girl can dream, I guess.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.952
Well, I'm exhausted.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.188
I don't know how you're gonna
stay up all night.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.123
There's only two hours
until midnight.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.993
12:01, and then it's officially
the day after Thanksgiving

10:28.095 --> 10:29.628
and the Christmas decorating
begins.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.962
It's still
the day after Thanksgiving

10:31.064 --> 10:31.997
in the morning, you know?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.898
It's tradition.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.534
Well, I know how important
decorating is to you, kiddo,

10:36.637 --> 10:38.637
so I will get out of your hair.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.171
- I'll stay and help.
- Oh, good.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.074
I've got some heavy boxes
for you to drag out.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.676
- Thanks, Darce.
- I love you.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.277
That was delicious,
despite the turkey.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.413
Oh. Well, I tried.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.086
That was a really fun night.

10:55.188 --> 10:58.056
Your parents only sniped
at each other three times.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.557
Total win.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.060
It is a pretty good record
for them, huh?

11:02.162 --> 11:05.730
Okay. Point me to the heavy
things that need lifting.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.099
- It's not time yet.
- Oh, come on, be a rebel.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.934
- Let's start early.
- No. We can't.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.004
It's still Thanksgiving,
it's not right.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.040
Yeah, you're right,
the, uh, Christmas police

11:15.142 --> 11:16.508
could find out, huh?

11:16.610 --> 11:18.109
Oh.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.545
Okay, compromise.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.280
We take out the boxes now,

11:22.382 --> 11:25.283
but we don't open them
until midnight.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.285
Deal?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.753
12:01.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.922
Deal.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.357
But we cannot do any decorating

11:32.459 --> 11:35.193
without the proper regalia.

11:38.498 --> 11:42.634
A <i> My Favorite Things</i> mercantile.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.903
Every village needs one,
am I right?

11:45.005 --> 11:47.872
Where else would you get
your warm, woolen mittens?

11:47.974 --> 11:51.376
Or your schnitzel
with noodles. Oh.

11:51.478 --> 11:57.615
Maybe in Pub.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.452
Oh, only the classics
served in Pub.

12:00.554 --> 12:05.223
Oh, this is too cute!

12:05.325 --> 12:08.059
Okay. I'd live here.
I claim this as my house.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.930
Uh, n-n-no.
That is where I live.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.899
Ouch. So I'm homeless.

12:15.001 --> 12:19.504
No. You would live here.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.941
Hm, well, uh, uh, do I at least
get to pick where it goes?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.543
No! No. No, that's my job.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.613
Okay, boss.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.684
Uh... where does this go?

12:33.954 --> 12:37.155
Um, here.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.924
And what about this guy?

12:40.026 --> 12:43.328
- Ooh, ooh, careful.
- I'm being careful.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.998
He goes right here.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.468
Isn't it a little boring, doing
it the same way every year?

12:50.570 --> 12:54.205
I mean, you have almost
infinite possibilities here.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.174
We could try some of them.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.444
This is how I want it.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.112
How do you know what you want
if you haven't tried

13:01.214 --> 13:02.680
all the options?

13:02.783 --> 13:06.117
Because this way works.
This way makes sense.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.053
You know, nothing bad
will happen

13:09.156 --> 13:11.890
if you change something.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.892
Why does anything
have to change?

13:13.994 --> 13:17.896
Well, because life is change.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.198
And that's why my Christmas
village doesn't, okay?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.968
I don't have control over life!
I have control over this...

13:24.070 --> 13:26.037
Why are you being so weird
about this?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.539
This is something
I look forward to every year,

13:27.641 --> 13:30.475
and you're ruining it.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.010
Ruining it? Great. Okay.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.712
Well, I thought
I was part of your fun,

13:34.815 --> 13:37.916
but if not, I'll just go home.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.984
See you later, Darcy.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.522
Brandon, wait. Oh...

13:46.159 --> 13:47.325
Oh, no.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.900
How did I not know
this place was still around?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.337
This is where I first fell
in love with Christmas villages.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.541
- We do keep unusual hours.
- Uh, yeah, it's...

15:10.644 --> 15:12.143
It's 2:00 in the morning.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.946
Well, it is the day
after Thanksgiving.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.382
Officially,
the start of Christmas season.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.218
That's what I always say.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.889
So what are you missing?

15:27.661 --> 15:30.995
- What?
- From your Christmas village.

15:31.097 --> 15:35.867
Oh. Well,
I broke my post office.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.535
You can't have
a perfect Christmas village

15:37.637 --> 15:40.004
with no post office.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.706
Do you have an Irish one?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.644
I've got one right here.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.479
Oh.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.815
It's perfect.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.651
I'll take it. Thank you.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.886
When I was a little girl

15:54.988 --> 15:58.056
and things weren't so great
at home,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.825
I used to come here and stare
at the Christmas villages.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.195
I dreamed of a place
where all your worries were gone

16:04.297 --> 16:07.231
and it was the perfect
Irish Christmas.

16:07.334 --> 16:11.035
You know, uh, I have
some one-of-a-kind pieces.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.236
Over here.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.878
She looks just like me.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.015
She'd be right at home
in your Irish Christmas village.

16:24.117 --> 16:27.952
- How much?
- For you, it's on the house.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.454
- Really?
- Hm.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.422
Thank you.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.158
It's my pleasure.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.294
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.186
Here's to a perfect Christmas.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.569
Alexa, turn off alarm.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.678
What?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.417
Did I take an Ambien
last night?

18:04.951 --> 18:07.085
- Merry Christmas, love.
- Merry Christmas, love.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.823
Hot chocolate.
With a bit of whipped cream.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.559
Just the way you like it.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.294
Why are you two together?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.996
And smiling and...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.498
Why are you talking like that,
dad?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.333
Whatever do you mean?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.702
This is how I talk.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.204
Are you all right, love?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.708
Uh, no.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.244
Have your hot chocolate.
You'll feel better.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.989
This is the best cocoa
I've ever had.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.691
Oh, thanks, dear.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.693
Wait till you try the waffles.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.228
Waffles?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.138
Where am I?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.309
Have a seat, love.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.213
Just the way you like them.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.588
- You guys are punking me.
- We're what now?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.091
This is some kind
of reality show

19:20.193 --> 19:22.426
where you gaslight
the children of divorce

19:22.529 --> 19:25.563
with happiness and everything
they've ever wanted, huh?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.431
Darcy, you're not making
any sense now.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.268
I'm not making any sense?
You guys can't stand each other.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.702
- Where'd you get that now?
- No.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.739
From your divorce!

19:34.841 --> 19:37.475
Your mother and I
have been

19:37.577 --> 19:40.778
happily married for 30 years.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.048
Huh. I must be dreaming.

19:44.150 --> 19:47.752
Oh! It is time to wake up now,
Darcy. Wake up! Wake up!

19:47.854 --> 19:50.621
Your blood sugars must be low.
Eat up your waffles, love.

19:50.723 --> 19:54.058
I don't want waffles! I wanna
understand what is going on.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.929
No waffles,
on Christmas morning?

19:58.031 --> 20:01.065
- I'm sorry. What now?
- Christmas morning.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.501
When we have waffles
and hot chocolate

20:03.603 --> 20:06.571
and then we open presents.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.906
But it was Thanksgiving
yesterday.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.275
No, it was Christmas yesterday,
love.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.077
You just said
it's Christmas today.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.846
And it will be Christmas
tomorrow.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.015
What are you talking about?

20:18.117 --> 20:21.118
It's Christmas every day
here in Christmas Town, love.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.687
Christmas Town?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.656
Christmas Town?

20:25.758 --> 20:26.991
Ah, no.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.163
I'm insane.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.265
Carmen was right.
The stress got to me.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.968
I've had a psychotic break...

20:37.070 --> 20:39.637
I can't do this!
I have to get out of here.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.176
Come on, Bill.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.054
I'm in my Christmas village.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.297
I'm in my Christmas village.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.671
I'm in my Christmas village!

21:13.773 --> 21:15.339
It's a Christmas miracle!

21:17.143 --> 21:19.043
- Honey!
- Your waffles.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.244
Oh!

21:24.584 --> 21:26.417
Mom, these are so good.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.352
Oh, thank you, love.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.421
Shall we do
the Christmas presents?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.656
Ho-ho-ho!

21:38.931 --> 21:42.500
A sketchbook. I love it.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.102
- I knew you would.
- Thank you.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.205
- You're welcome.
- This is perfect.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.841
- This. Open this one next.
- Okay.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.944
Mmm...

21:55.548 --> 21:58.249
You guys...

21:58.351 --> 22:00.318
It's beautiful!

22:01.187 --> 22:03.354
Aw, thank you.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.268
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.708
Merry Christmas.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.143
Merry Christmas.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.084
Gingerbread man?

22:33.186 --> 22:35.753
Oh. Thank you.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.522
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.792
Mm. Oh.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.862
Hm.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.365
Perfect.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.306
Hello, gorgeous.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.111
Tom? Why-why are you here?

23:00.213 --> 23:02.146
Where else would I be?

23:02.248 --> 23:03.514
I can't imagine
spending Christmas

23:03.616 --> 23:05.349
without my lovely girlfriend.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.584
Girlfriend?

23:06.686 --> 23:09.987
Of course.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.690
And, and since when
are you Irish?

23:12.792 --> 23:15.326
I don't understand the question,
sweetheart.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.129
Never mind.

23:18.231 --> 23:21.665
Good, 'cause it's a perfect day.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.767
For what?

23:24.170 --> 23:26.003
We're goin' on a ride.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.983
It always snows
on our carriage ride.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.786
- You doing okay?
- Oh, my gosh.

23:46.225 --> 23:50.127
It's just as wonderful
as I always thought it would be.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.197
- Smells like Christmas.
- Ah.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.199
Every single day.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.805
It's time for one
of your Christmas presents.

24:03.342 --> 24:06.644
Now, you get to design

24:06.746 --> 24:08.712
your very own
Christmas sweater.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.817
- Really?
- Anything you want.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.518
Made to order.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.121
- Anything?
- Choose your color.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.096
Cool.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.936
Hm.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.911
- I love it!
- Let's go show 'em off.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.188
Tom, you're right.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.557
Ah.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.033
Will you close your eyes for me?

25:09.876 --> 25:12.309
All right. You can look now.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.915
Snow? But how?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.417
- Christmas magic.
- Oh, yeah.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.759
- This calls for a snowman.
- My thoughts exactly.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.436
This is the best snowman
I have ever made.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.804
It's perfect.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.009
- You get me.
- I know.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.614
It's snowing.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.016
All in the hour.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.756
That's so beautiful.
I'll be right back.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.629
Mom, do you have a timer set
for the turkey?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.464
Oh, you know I don't need one.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.966
You're just keeping
an eye on it?

26:09.068 --> 26:13.671
Oh! The turkey always comes out
just right.

26:13.773 --> 26:17.341
- These ovens are foolproof.
- Should have known.

26:17.443 --> 26:18.576
Mm.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.646
All this rich food.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.981
I'm gonna go for a run
in the morning

26:24.083 --> 26:26.517
or I'm gonna outgrow my pants.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.486
Uh, no one gains weight
in Christmas Town, love.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.157
- You can eat what you want.
- Shut up.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.859
- Sorry.
- No, I mean, that's amazing.

26:35.962 --> 26:39.163
You're perfect.
Just the way you are.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.764
And you always will be.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.202
Oh, man.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.837
I love it here.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.452
Oh, look,
there's a bench right up front.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.337
- Carmen?
- Mayor Carmen.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.774
Seriously? Like, she won an
election? People voted for her?

27:23.876 --> 27:27.177
Oh, Mayor Carmen is the town's
most popular resident.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.180
- She's a delightful woman.
- Huh?

27:30.282 --> 27:31.682
Another Christmas miracle.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.751
Happy Christmas,
everyone.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.853
As your mayor, it is my honor
to welcome you all

27:35.955 --> 27:38.088
to tonight's wonderful concert.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.458
The perfect ending
to another perfect Christmas.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.360
So without further ado,

27:43.462 --> 27:46.330
please welcome

Somebody really has
the Christmas spirit.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.781
<i>♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪♪</i>

29:12.051 --> 29:15.385
I have one more surprise for ya.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.755
Uh, this has already been
the best day ever.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.991
And now it's even better.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.395
Go on. Open it.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.239
It's beautiful.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.740
Thank you, Tom.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.186
Well, goodnight.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.155
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.689
Merry Christmas, Darcy.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.325
Merry Christmas.

29:58.798 --> 29:59.663
<i>Hey, so it's aft</i>

29:59.732 --> 30:02.432
<i>Hey, so it's after Thanksgiving</i>

30:02.535 --> 30:04.168
<i>which means you're probably out
buying a Christmas tree</i>

30:04.270 --> 30:05.969
but this is like
the 16th time I've called.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.071
You're gonna have to talk to me
at some point,

30:08.174 --> 30:10.240
especially,
since I'm coming over.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.813
Having trouble
finding what you want?

30:50.783 --> 30:51.982
Uh, yeah, actually.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.384
Um, uham,

30:54.486 --> 30:56.520
I'm looking for a peace offering

30:56.622 --> 30:58.021
for a Christmas super fan

30:58.123 --> 31:00.057
and it's gotta be perfect.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.492
Oh, that is tricky.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.862
Does she have
a Christmas village?

31:04.964 --> 31:07.364
Yeah, a real cute
Irish one, yeah.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.033
But, uh,
it seems like she's already got

31:10.135 --> 31:12.369
everything she needs,
though. So...

31:12.471 --> 31:15.906
Perhaps, something
from our one-of-a-kind section.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.616
Whoa!

31:27.620 --> 31:30.020
It's perfect, isn't it?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.591
Yeah, it is.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.704
It's Christmas again!

31:55.648 --> 31:57.814
- Merry Christmas, mom and dad.
- Mm.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.784
- Merry Christmas, Darcy.
- Merry Christmas, Darcy.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.920
- Here you go!
- Ooh, thank you.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.722
Do I smell waffles?

32:05.824 --> 32:07.557
You sure do. Come on.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.794
- Mm.
- More hot chocolate?

32:10.896 --> 32:13.130
Six seems a little naughty.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.299
It is Christmas.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.467
Good point, dad.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.002
Fill her up.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.542
Oh. A green one.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.045
Thanks, mom and dad.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.346
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.735
Yup.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.383
Gingerbread man?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.652
Thank you.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.621
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

33:14.927 --> 33:16.727
Oh, hello, gorgeous.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.030
Hey, Tom.
Fancy meeting you here.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.366
We always meet here.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.469
I know, it was...
It was just a...

33:25.571 --> 33:28.071
Never mind.
Shall we go for a ride?

33:37.583 --> 33:40.350
So I was I thinking
kind of, like a crew neckline.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.220
Thought maybe this green
and blend it with this green,

33:43.322 --> 33:45.856
kinda give it like
an overall, like, faded effect.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.524
- Mm.
- Isn't it great? Yeah.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.910
Another perfect snowman.

34:07.012 --> 34:09.079
Another perfect Christmas
with you.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.750
- Mm.
- More potatoes, Sylvia?

34:13.851 --> 34:16.186
- Mm. Why, thank you, Bill.
- Can I get in on that?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.788
There's totally room.
Right there.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.257
- I'll go first.
- Yes.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.159
I never get full.

34:26.465 --> 34:30.734
<i>♪ O Christmas tree

34:30.835 --> 34:35.438

34:39.878 --> 34:42.212
I have one more surprise for ya.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.784
Ah-ha! It's beautiful.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.351
Thank you.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.458
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.399
Darcy?

35:05.104 --> 35:07.971
Come on! You know
I hate it when we fight.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.275
I have a present.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.116
Okay, if you didn't want me
to let myself in,

35:19.218 --> 35:21.651
you shouldn't have told me
where the spare key is.

35:27.092 --> 35:28.525
Darcy?

35:31.864 --> 35:35.432
Darcy, you here? No.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.933
Great.

35:43.775 --> 35:44.908
Hm.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.452
What the...

35:56.555 --> 35:57.787
Darcy?

35:57.890 --> 35:59.089
Darcy!

35:59.892 --> 36:01.258
Darcy?

36:05.797 --> 36:06.796
Man, where are you?

36:13.105 --> 36:14.771
Mm...

36:16.808 --> 36:18.375
Ha.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.424
- Good morning. Oh.
- Good morning.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.560
Hey, are there any shops
open today?

36:36.662 --> 36:39.396
Of course, love.
They're open Christmas hours.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.531
- Why do you ask?
- Well...

36:41.633 --> 36:44.801
It occurred to me that I never
get you guys any presents.

36:44.903 --> 36:45.869
Uh, sure,
we don't need anything.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.038
Sure, we got plenty of presents.

36:48.140 --> 36:50.240
But none of them are from me.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.609
You guys are so good to me.
I'd like to get you something.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.478
- Ah, that's sweet.
- If unnecessary.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.948
Okay. I'm going
to get you presents.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.316
Don't you want
your waffles first?

36:59.418 --> 37:00.784
It's okay.
I'll grab a cookie.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.941
"'Twas the night
before Christmas

37:25.043 --> 37:26.309
when all through the house

37:26.411 --> 37:27.811
not a creature was stirring,

37:27.913 --> 37:29.779
not even a mouse.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.882
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

37:32.985 --> 37:36.086
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there.

37:40.192 --> 37:42.959
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

37:43.061 --> 37:46.763
while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads.

37:46.865 --> 37:50.000
And mama in her 'kerchief
and I in my cap,

37:50.102 --> 37:54.771
had just settled down
for a long winter's nap...

37:54.873 --> 37:57.874
when out on the lawn
there arose such a clatter,

37:57.976 --> 38:00.877
I sprang from my bed
to see what was the matter.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.680
Away to the window,
I flew like a flash.

38:03.782 --> 38:08.118
Tore open the shutter
and threw open the sash.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.987
The moon on the breast
of a new fallen snow

38:11.089 --> 38:12.455
gave the luster of mid-day..."

38:12.557 --> 38:15.692
Hiya. Let me get those
wrapped up for you.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.727
Thank you.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.463
Oh, you know,
I'm not sure I have any money.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.799
Oh, try your pocket.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.701
That's where
most people keep their money.

38:31.243 --> 38:32.609
Hm.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.212
Uh, you know, I am just gonna,

38:36.315 --> 38:38.615
I'm gonna grab a few more,
uh, a few, a coup...

38:38.717 --> 38:40.984
- Some. I'll be right back.
- Go ahead.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.907
- Ooh.
- Oh! I'm so sorry.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.276
- Darcy?
- Brandon?

39:06.378 --> 39:08.044
I-I'm so glad I found you!

39:08.146 --> 39:10.180
Where have you been hiding
this whole time?

39:10.282 --> 39:12.882
What are you talking about?
This is a dream, right? Uh...

39:12.984 --> 39:15.385
This is a dream,
I-I ate some bad curry

39:15.487 --> 39:18.321
and now I'm dreaming I'm
in your Irish Christmas village?

39:19.191 --> 39:20.290
Brandon?

39:20.392 --> 39:22.892
Brandon-Brandon?
You woke up here?

39:22.994 --> 39:25.528
Yeah, in that little stone house
you said was mine.

39:25.630 --> 39:28.598
It's really you!

39:28.700 --> 39:30.967
- Who else would I be?
- Ah! Another version of you.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.136
It's hard to explain, but I
don't think you're dreaming,

39:33.238 --> 39:34.704
unless we're having
the same dream.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.439
Is that a thing?
Can that happen?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.242
What's the alternative? Another
dimension in the multiverse?

39:39.344 --> 39:40.610
A psychotic break?

39:40.712 --> 39:43.780
Does it matter?
Brandon, it's great here.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.082
It's Christmas every day.
Nothing ever goes wrong.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.650
And you can eat
whatever you want.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.085
You never gain any weight.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.787
- I can get behind that.
- Hm. Hm...

39:50.889 --> 39:53.456
Oh, oh, and...

39:53.558 --> 39:55.925
you always have cash.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.461
- Okay.
- It's kind of the perfect place.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.630
Come on. I'll take you home.
My parents will make us waffles.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.298
- Your parents?
- Oh, yeah.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.235
They're together here.
And my dad is Irish now.

40:05.337 --> 40:08.304
- Well, actually... Yeah.
- Everyone's Irish here. Yeah.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.974
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Oh, hi, Tom.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.743
- Tom, like, Tom from work?
- Yeah.

40:13.845 --> 40:17.213
Like her boyfriend, Tom.
Uh, what's your name?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.649
Um, Brandon.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.084
You have a boyfriend now?

40:21.186 --> 40:22.819
Apparently.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.021
- Hey, ready to go for our drive?
- Hm.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.658
Oh, I thought
we were gonna have waffles.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.060
Oh, we always
go for our ride now.

40:31.163 --> 40:34.597
Uh, could we go later?
Or tomorrow?

40:36.535 --> 40:39.536
You know what? It's Christmas.
We can do whatever we want.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.673
We can have waffles
and then go for a ride.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.475
Yeah?

40:45.577 --> 40:48.144
Whatever you want. Here,
let me help you with those.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.380
- No, I-I got 'em.
- Oh, I insist.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.349
Okay, here you go, big guy.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.451
Huh?

40:57.456 --> 40:58.855
Shall we?

41:01.393 --> 41:02.459
Mm.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.531
Sylvia,
these waffles are amazing!

41:08.633 --> 41:11.301
And Bill,
this cocoa, it's the best.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.102
Oh, cheers, Brandon.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.241
Let's go for our drive now,
dear.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.543
Oh, that's a great idea.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.379
Um, sure.
I guess we could all go.

41:23.482 --> 41:24.914
- Yeah.
- Hm.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.687
Sorry.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.455
There's not really any room.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.658
- Uh, sure there is.
- Oh!

41:35.760 --> 41:37.427
Uh... Yeah, well,
maybe we should--

41:37.529 --> 41:39.996
No, no, no, no. It's just...
We'll be fine.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.264
We'll just, oh...

41:41.366 --> 41:42.665
- Just get all snuggly.
- Ooh. Okay.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.667
Uh, there we go. Just...

41:44.769 --> 41:47.370
- That's my arm.
- Oh, sorry. Okay.

41:47.472 --> 41:49.639
Giddy up! Huh?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.175
Oh! Okay.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.389
All right.
Christmas-sweater time.

42:06.491 --> 42:08.458
Oh, what? That's it?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.926
Yeah.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.095
Wait, you don't go anywhere else
in this thing?

42:12.197 --> 42:13.563
No.

42:13.665 --> 42:17.233
So you just do the exact
same drive every day?

42:17.335 --> 42:19.769
Our days are exactly
as they're supposed to be.

42:22.574 --> 42:25.975
Come on, Darcy, let's get you
that Christmas sweater.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.211
I think it'll be fine.
Come on. Come on.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.316
- Take my hand.
- Yeah. All righty.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.387
- What is this place?
- Oh, just you wait.

42:40.825 --> 42:43.326
We can pick anything we want.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.862
- Anything?
- Mm-hmm.

42:47.399 --> 42:48.731
Okay.

42:48.833 --> 42:51.367
- Yes. Yes. Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

42:51.469 --> 42:54.370
Yes.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.781
Oh, ye old Pub.
Now we're talking.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.115
I could use a pint.

43:06.217 --> 43:07.483
Oh, we're not here for drinking.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.590
Don't worry,
it's easier than it...

43:14.859 --> 43:15.925
looks.

43:20.198 --> 43:21.798
Yeah.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.701
Hey, Darcy,
I bet you can't do this.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.669
Oh, I bet I can.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.338
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

43:29.608 --> 43:32.609
Oh, okay.
There you go. Yeah...

43:32.711 --> 43:34.077
It's just old me.

43:34.879 --> 43:36.279
This is awesome.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.421
Darcy is a gazelle
in a Christmas sweater.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.326
Oh, you're-you're graceful
is what I meant.

43:50.428 --> 43:53.096
Aw, thank you.

43:53.198 --> 43:55.031
- Should we spin?
- Yes.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.038
Hey, Darce, check this out.

44:14.653 --> 44:15.752
Whoo.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.192
Whoo!

44:24.596 --> 44:27.096
Very nice.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.803
Hi there, folks,
be sure to check out

44:33.905 --> 44:36.272
our delicious eggnog, cider

44:36.374 --> 44:39.509
and hot chocolate
with extra cream. Yummy.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.312
- Is that Carmen?
- Sort of.

44:43.415 --> 44:46.249
Darcy. Tom, Bill, Sylvia.

44:46.351 --> 44:47.850
So very delightful to see you

44:47.952 --> 44:50.119
on this most perfect
Christmas day.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.854
Carmen,
this is my friend, Brandon.

44:51.956 --> 44:54.490
Hello, Brandon,
everyone is always welcome

44:54.592 --> 44:55.725
here in Christmas Town.

44:55.827 --> 44:56.893
Oh.

45:00.732 --> 45:02.665
It's good. It's good.

45:02.767 --> 45:05.435
You'll like this version of her.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.804
<i>♪ Oh jingle bells
jingle bells ♪</i>

45:07.906 --> 45:10.373
<i>♪ Jingle all the way ♪</i>

45:10.475 --> 45:12.575
<i>♪ Oh what fun it is to ride ♪</i>

45:12.677 --> 45:14.777
<i>♪ In a one-horse
open sleigh... ♪♪</i>

45:17.415 --> 45:19.382
I admit, Darcy, I finally get

45:19.484 --> 45:20.783
what you love so much
about this village.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.852
It's really beautiful here.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.354
It is, isn't it?

45:25.457 --> 45:26.689
It seems like
you might have overcorrected

45:26.791 --> 45:28.725
a little on Carmen, though.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.460
- What?
- I mean, I know she was gloomy.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.729
But this version of Carmen
is ridiculously cheerful.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.130
She's like a pod person.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.532
What does that have to do
with me?

45:36.634 --> 45:38.234
Come on, this whole place,
everyone in it,

45:38.336 --> 45:40.303
it's all your fantasy.

45:40.405 --> 45:43.072
Your parents back together,
you dating Mr. Perfect,

45:43.174 --> 45:46.175
Christmas every day,
everything under control,

45:46.277 --> 45:48.878
no room for change
or improvisation.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.581
Everything according to plan,
your plan.

45:51.683 --> 45:54.016
It's-it's your Christmas village
come to life.

45:54.119 --> 45:56.753
But I didn't make it happen. I
woke up here just like you did.

45:56.855 --> 45:59.055
Well,
keep telling yourself that.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.324
Uh, why are you trying
to ruin this for me?

46:03.294 --> 46:05.228
I'm sorry you find the truth
so upsetting.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.663
I think I've had enough
of your company for a while.

46:07.766 --> 46:09.265
Goodnight, Brandon.

46:09.367 --> 46:10.933
Yeah, sure.
Okay, I'll just go home.

46:11.035 --> 46:13.369
Oh, no, sorry, I can't do that
because I'm stuck here

46:13.471 --> 46:15.104
in your weird little
Christmas fantasy land.

46:15.206 --> 46:18.107
So I'll just go back to my
adorable stone house, I guess.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.144
Good. Fine. Merry Christmas.

46:22.914 --> 46:26.916
Ah, I finally have you
all to myself.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.996
Thank you. I'll-I'll wear it
with the other ones.

46:40.098 --> 46:41.731
Layering is in now, right?

46:46.704 --> 46:49.105
- Goodnight, Darcy.
- Merry Christmas, Brandon.

46:50.341 --> 46:51.941
Tom.

46:52.043 --> 46:55.378
Right. Sorry. That was weird.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.115
Merry Christmas, Tom.
Goodnight, Tom.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.863
I'm sorry. I was a jerk.

47:47.532 --> 47:48.998
Forgive me?

47:52.270 --> 47:53.369
Brandon!

47:53.471 --> 47:55.438
I said I'm sorry.

47:57.609 --> 48:01.277
Relax. I can't stay mad at you.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.578
Come on.

48:04.315 --> 48:05.348
There's something
I wanna show ya.

48:05.450 --> 48:07.450
- What?
- You'll see.

48:07.552 --> 48:08.451
- What is it?
- You'll see.

48:08.553 --> 48:09.952
Tell me.

48:15.093 --> 48:16.459
- Check it out. Check it out.
- Huh.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.294
Ah.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.001
I know,
it's like a Disney movie, right?

48:25.103 --> 48:28.104
I had no idea
it was so beautiful out here.

48:30.608 --> 48:33.576
Reminds me of that hike we went
on freshman year. Remember?

48:35.113 --> 48:36.379
You know,
I never told you this,

48:36.481 --> 48:40.049
but... I thought
it was gonna be a date.

48:41.819 --> 48:43.853
It was.

48:43.955 --> 48:46.222
- No, it wasn't.
- It was supposed to be.

48:46.324 --> 48:49.992
But, I, uh, I didn't exactly
have game when I was 18.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.395
You could say that again.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.397
- Don't rub it in.
- Rarr.

48:54.499 --> 48:57.500
It's probably
the biggest regret of my life

48:57.602 --> 48:59.568
that I didn't kiss you that day.

49:02.006 --> 49:03.339
Well, I'm glad you didn't

49:03.441 --> 49:05.374
because odds are
we would have broken up

49:05.476 --> 49:07.743
and I wouldn't have
my best friend.

49:07.845 --> 49:09.845
Right. Your best friend.

49:11.683 --> 49:13.282
Hey, we don't know
where this goes.

49:13.384 --> 49:15.017
We shouldn't...
We should go back.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.520
Well, there's an easy way
to fix that.

49:17.622 --> 49:20.156
We keep walking and find out.

49:20.258 --> 49:22.992
Oh. Okay, Magellan.
Aye, aye, captain.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.801
- Oh, look, a deer! Whoa!
- There's another one. Whoa!

49:31.903 --> 49:33.235
Are you okay?

49:33.338 --> 49:36.038
Absolutely. Totally fine.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.607
Okay.

49:40.979 --> 49:42.745
Hey, wait.
We should see where this goes.

49:42.847 --> 49:43.846
Yeah.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.216
Now,
that is picturesque.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.351
Yeah.

49:51.055 --> 49:53.155
- Should we say hi?
- Sure.

49:54.692 --> 49:55.725
Hey.

49:57.028 --> 49:58.294
Hi.

49:58.396 --> 50:01.397
I wish I had an apple for you.

50:01.499 --> 50:04.533
Your wish is granted.

50:06.104 --> 50:07.503
I love it here.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.574
- Good.
- Is that tasty?

50:11.676 --> 50:13.709
Ooh. Yes. Oh.

50:17.248 --> 50:19.782
Uh, gosh, it's getting cold.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.017
Hell yeah.

50:22.854 --> 50:25.421
- Gingerbread man?
- Ah! Thank you.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.989
Oh, whoa.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.992
These look so delicious.

50:32.964 --> 50:34.330
Did you have enough?
Was that good?

50:34.432 --> 50:37.333
Mm. Thank you.

50:37.435 --> 50:39.802
Mm. Mm.

50:39.904 --> 50:41.837
- Mm. Yeah.
- Gosh.

50:41.939 --> 50:44.807
After me?

50:44.909 --> 50:46.008
Brr, I'm cold.

50:46.110 --> 50:48.911
Yeah, let's make a fire.

50:51.983 --> 50:53.416
Okay.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.685
Yes.

50:56.788 --> 50:57.920
Right.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.793
I wonder if there's anything
on TV here.

51:03.895 --> 51:08.931
Come on,<i> Real Housewives</i>
<i>Of The North Pole.</i> Please.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.806
<i>Yule Log</i> TV it is.

51:16.908 --> 51:18.841
I always wanted my fireplace
and stereo.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.992
- No? Okay, so...
- No. Not gonna work.

51:37.095 --> 51:39.095
What are we going for,
like, regal

51:39.197 --> 51:42.965
or, uh, rugged or inscrutable?

51:43.067 --> 51:46.001
- Just be you. That's all I need.
- Okay.

51:53.377 --> 51:54.376
Just need to get
a little closer.

51:54.479 --> 51:56.078
Okay. Okay.

51:57.181 --> 51:58.114
Oh, those are like ice.

51:58.216 --> 52:00.249
Oh, you're so sensitive.

52:00.351 --> 52:03.352
Yeah, let me warm 'em up for ya.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.988
Oh, you'ight.
That is much better.

52:06.090 --> 52:07.123
Yup.

52:27.445 --> 52:30.479
- Hot cider, love?
- Uh. Ah.

52:30.581 --> 52:33.716
Dad! That's so nice of you.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.651
You're usually out
this time of day,

52:35.753 --> 52:37.353
but you're inside today.

52:37.455 --> 52:39.722
Yes. Thank you.

52:40.525 --> 52:43.259
Darcy!

52:43.361 --> 52:44.760
Darcy?

52:46.764 --> 52:48.330
- Oh, Darcy!
- Come on in.

52:48.432 --> 52:51.333
There you are.
I was so worried.

52:51.435 --> 52:53.335
I-I looked for you, uh-uh,
in-in the square

52:53.437 --> 52:55.704
and on the road and the mill
and the pub.

52:55.806 --> 52:57.673
You weren't
at any of those places.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.576
I know. I'm sorry. I...

53:00.678 --> 53:02.678
I was just trying
something different today.

53:02.780 --> 53:05.948
Different? But why?

53:06.050 --> 53:07.716
Our days
are exactly as they should be.

53:07.818 --> 53:10.186
Oh, you're all here.

53:10.288 --> 53:12.855
You're usually out at this time.

53:12.957 --> 53:15.958
Yup! All inside today.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.160
Today is different.

53:18.262 --> 53:20.095
I better get the dinner ready.

53:23.467 --> 53:25.100
Well...

53:25.203 --> 53:27.903
Uh, don't let us keep you
from...

53:28.005 --> 53:29.838
wherever it is
you need to be going.

53:32.376 --> 53:35.644
Oh, I'm right
where I'm supposed to be.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.682
- Hm.
- Hm.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.484
I am leaving.

53:42.587 --> 53:44.286
<i>♪ Dashing through the snow ♪</i>

53:44.388 --> 53:46.255
<i>♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪</i>

53:46.357 --> 53:48.824
<i>♪ O'er the fields we go ♪</i>

53:48.926 --> 53:51.026
<i>♪ Laughing all the way ♪♪</i>

54:00.705 --> 54:03.072
"Up the chimney
he rose.

54:03.174 --> 54:06.642
He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.979
And away they all flew,
like the down of a thistle.

54:10.081 --> 54:14.049
But I heard him exclaim,
ere he drove out of sight...

54:14.151 --> 54:18.254
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night."

54:21.859 --> 54:23.959
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course!

54:24.061 --> 54:26.462
I can always make time
for my constituents.

54:26.564 --> 54:28.097
No, no, no, I mean, as a friend.

54:28.199 --> 54:29.765
Oh. Okay.

54:32.803 --> 54:35.271
No, I really think you should
think about joining the choir.

54:35.373 --> 54:36.939
It's such a great Christmas
experience, you should.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.607
- You should.
- I know, but I can't.

54:38.709 --> 54:40.509
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.280
So.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.882
What did you wanna talk about?

54:46.984 --> 54:49.952
Well, I'm starting to wonder...

54:51.789 --> 54:53.956
You know, like,
when you have a favorite sweater

54:54.058 --> 54:56.692
and it's really comfortable
and soft,

54:56.794 --> 55:00.362
but it has, maybe,
a few stains and some holes.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.697
It's not really
a dress-up sweater,

55:01.799 --> 55:03.999
though it does make you laugh.

55:04.101 --> 55:07.870
But, when, out in the world,
you want a newer, fancier

55:07.972 --> 55:10.539
more put-together,
less-frumpy sweater.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.908
The kind of sweater
that makes a statement

55:13.010 --> 55:15.978
about who you are and who you're
supposed to be with,

55:16.080 --> 55:20.049
even if it's not as soft
as your old one.

55:20.151 --> 55:24.486
I think maybe you just need
to wash it a few more times.

55:24.588 --> 55:26.588
It's more
of a-a metaphorical sweater.

55:26.691 --> 55:28.424
See, Tom--

55:28.526 --> 55:30.159
Oh, don't worry about it.

55:30.261 --> 55:32.428
He'll propose
when the time is right.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.430
No, no, no. No, no,
that's not what I--

55:34.532 --> 55:37.199
He's handsome, kind,

55:37.301 --> 55:41.170
dependable, neat, punctual.

55:41.272 --> 55:43.272
He's everything
anyone could want.

55:44.442 --> 55:47.376
Right. You're right.

55:47.478 --> 55:50.179
I don't wanna be with someone
who can't write things down

55:50.281 --> 55:53.882
and is messy and unpredictable
and funny and exciting

55:53.984 --> 55:56.685
and wrong for me.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.554
Totally wrong for me.

55:58.656 --> 56:02.191
Just trust that things are
how they are supposed to be.

56:02.293 --> 56:03.659
Perfect.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.529
Yeah. Perfect.

56:14.739 --> 56:16.405
Hey.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.674
- Hey, hey, you, uh, yesterday--
- Yeah, wait, stop, stop, stop.

56:18.776 --> 56:21.176
I don't want you to
say anything we can't take back.

56:21.278 --> 56:22.544
- Darcy, just-just wait. Hang on.
- No, no, no.

56:22.646 --> 56:24.246
Please let me say this.

56:24.348 --> 56:26.715
You are so important to me.

56:26.817 --> 56:30.652
You are my oldest friend,
my best friend.

56:30.755 --> 56:33.188
And that's how
I want it to stay.

56:33.290 --> 56:35.657
That's what works.
That's what makes sense.

56:35.760 --> 56:38.894
Makes sense?
What about what feels right?

56:38.996 --> 56:40.396
We would drive each other crazy.

56:40.498 --> 56:42.364
In a good way.

56:42.466 --> 56:45.267
- We're too different.
- We're complementary.

56:45.369 --> 56:47.369
You need a puzzle piece
you fit together with.

56:47.471 --> 56:50.706
- Not an identical puzzle piece.
- You create chaos.

56:50.808 --> 56:53.475
Ah. I push you
out of your comfort zone.

56:55.479 --> 56:57.880
Brandon, I'm with Tom now.
You have to accept that.

56:57.982 --> 57:01.383
With Tom?
Tom is not a real person.

57:01.485 --> 57:03.085
This is not a real place.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.187
None of this is real!

57:05.289 --> 57:07.089
We can't know that!

57:07.191 --> 57:10.426
So what, you're just planning
on staying here forever?

57:10.528 --> 57:12.861
Why not? Things are good here.

57:12.963 --> 57:14.863
- It's perfect here!
- Perfect?

57:14.965 --> 57:17.633
Nothing ever changes!
Christmas has lost all meaning.

57:17.735 --> 57:21.069
It was special because it came
once a year. Once!

57:21.172 --> 57:23.071
There's only one reason I've
been putting up with all this

57:23.174 --> 57:25.007
and that's you, because I lo...

57:28.479 --> 57:30.179
Oh...

57:31.682 --> 57:34.149
Yeah. 'Cause I'm an idiot.

57:36.253 --> 57:37.953
I thought
this was the perfect opportunity

57:38.055 --> 57:41.290
for me to finally show you
how good we could be together.

57:41.392 --> 57:44.593
But all you want is a dream,
a safe, ordered fantasy

57:44.695 --> 57:47.429
where you can hide behind
all your comfortable traditions

57:47.531 --> 57:49.898
instead of taking a risk
on anything real!

57:50.000 --> 57:51.900
No, no, no, Brandon.
Brandon, wait.

57:52.002 --> 57:53.602
I can't believe it took me
this long to realize

57:53.704 --> 57:55.904
you don't want change.
Let me finish, please, okay?

57:56.006 --> 57:58.640
You keep doing the same thing
over and over again!

57:58.742 --> 58:01.143
And that's not real life, Darcy.

58:01.245 --> 58:02.311
Brandon!

58:05.783 --> 58:06.915
Oh, what?

58:21.532 --> 58:22.731
Tom.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.934
I'm so glad I found you.
Brandon just--

58:26.036 --> 58:27.936
Don't worry, Darcy.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.573
There's still time
to go for a ride.

58:41.852 --> 58:44.953
Why don't you pick some colors?
You'll feel better.

58:51.595 --> 58:54.696
Oh. Uh, but what other colors
do you want?

58:55.966 --> 58:57.099
None.

58:58.802 --> 59:02.604
Black isn't very, um,
Christmassy.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.607
Neither am I today.

59:11.515 --> 59:14.216
Well, I had to add something
to make it a Christmas sweater.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.217
I see.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.335
What's that?

59:33.437 --> 59:36.438
It's a snowma-corn.
The first of its kind!

59:39.443 --> 59:42.144
There's no such thing
as a snowma-corn.

59:42.246 --> 59:44.947
- There could be.
- That's funny.

59:57.127 --> 59:58.961
What about salad for dinner?

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.232
Christmas pizza?

01:00:04.335 --> 01:00:06.835
We always have turkey
for Christmas.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.172
But it's always Christmas.
Couldn't we go out for Chinese?

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.943
Guess that's a no.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:18.680
Okay.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.252
Ah.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:25.721
Thanks.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:30.225
Don't you like it?

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:34.329
It's not that.
It's beautiful. It's just...

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.299
Don't you think that doing the
same thing every day is boring?

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.668
No.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.770
Getting to live
the perfect Christmas

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:44.172
over and over again
with the perfect woman...

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.209
that's a dream come true.

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:53.315
Yes. A dream come true.
Goodnight.

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:10.799
- Tsk. Morning, Darcy.
- Mm...

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.135
How about I make
another batch of waffles?

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:16.271
No. Thank you.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.246
Is there a burger joint in town?

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.048
We could go down to Pub.

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:30.686
Yeah, Pub sounds good.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.590
Happy Christmas, dears!

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.259
- Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.760
Thank you.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:41.930
Can I get a burger?

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.399
Well, since it's Christmas,

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:46.501
we only have
the Christmas special.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:50.605
Turkey, gravy
and all the fixin's.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:55.010
Of course.
Um, three specials. I guess.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.779
Now, would you like that
with hot chocolate,

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.581
hot cider or eggnog?

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:02.117
- Surprise me.
- Comin' right up.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:05.087
Mm.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.759
I brought you one of each.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.134
Lovely. Thank you.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.205
Which one do you want?

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:24.740
We'll have whichever.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.876
- But which do you want?
- Whichever you don't want.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:30.979
If I weren't here,
which one would you drink?

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:35.217
But you are here. We want to
make sure you get what you want.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.319
Dad, do you have any opinions?

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:40.088
Whatever you want is fine by me.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.823
Really? No opinions?

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.226
Look, love,
we just want you to be happy.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.228
Okay, then,
what would make me happy

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.764
is if you guys made a decision.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.232
- We couldn't do that.
- No.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:53.568
We know how much you like
being in charge.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.736
Yeah,
we want to be certain

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:56.605
that you get what you want.

01:02:56.707 --> 01:02:58.340
I don't want any of this.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.442
Then what do you want?

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:01.643
I want a burger.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:04.312
I don't think they have those.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.716
I know. I will have the cider.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.651
All right, love.
If that's what you want.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:29.337
Darcy! There you are.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:30.972
I was looking for you
everywhere.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.675
- You found me.
- We're late for our ride.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.778
I'm not really feeling like
riding today.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.114
Well, it's-it's Christmas.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:40.816
Couldn't we do anything else?

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:46.888
Come on. Something different.
Please.

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:53.528
Whoa! You're going
the wrong way!

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:56.097
Darcy.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.801
Oh, fudge this.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:02.871
What? That's not what I meant.
I meant figgy pudding.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.942
I mean, toasted chestnuts!

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:09.044
W-w-what, what the humbug
is happening?

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:11.980
Darcy, that is no kind
of language for Christmas.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.316
What are you talking about? All
I'm saying are Christmas words!

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:16.618
Oh, I think we both know
what you're trying to say.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.553
And it's lacking
in the holiday cheer department.

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:21.022
It is not possible
for a person to be cheerful

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:22.290
one hundred percent of the time.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.226
Well, not with that attitude.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.898
Well, the chorus was lovely,
wasn't it?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.868
Hm.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.304
Um, so let me guess. You're
gonna give me a necklace now.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:39.474
- Of course.
- And then we're gonna kiss.

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:42.377
Of course.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:46.181
You know what? I...
Why don't we just skip all that?

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:49.551
I kind of feel like
being alone tonight. Okay?

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.086
Merry Christmas.

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.496
I'm getting out of here.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.901
Stop that car now!

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.323
Striped woolen muffler!

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.601
Frosted fruitcake!

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:17.572
Okay. Come on.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:20.275
Gate, secret door, ladder.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:32.787
Jingle bells!

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.442
Stocking stuffer!

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:07.822
- Gingerbread man?
- Thank you.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.927
- Gingerbread man?
- Not today.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.597
But it's Christmas.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.333
Oh, is it? I hadn't noticed.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:20.802
It's only my millionth spin
on the infinite carousel

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:22.437
of Christmas that never ends.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.607
So forgive me
if I want one gumdrop day

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.676
without one
of your stupid gingerbread men!

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.347
Oh, oh, oh, no, no. Oh, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:33.815
No, no, don't take it...
Uh, I take it back.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:36.484
Don't do that.
Merry Christmas.

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:39.320
Thank you! I-I love
your gingerbread men, okay?

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:41.056
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:44.159
Santa does love you! Okay.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.801
Christmas not going
how you planned?

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:57.839
You?

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.209
You did this to me.

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:05.080
It was that stupid figurine
you gave me.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.682
I opened a door.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:09.517
You're the one
who went through it.

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:11.886
Well, open it back up...

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:14.055
"Elsie," 'cause I want out.

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:16.925
It's not a literal door, Darcy.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:19.961
This world, it's yours.

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:23.631
Only you can get yourself
out of it.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.466
But how?

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:28.903
What do you really want, Darcy?

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:31.906
- To go home.
- No.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:33.942
In your heart of hearts,

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:36.478
what do you really want?

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.283
Ah, well,
you better figure it out...

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.388
or it's Christmas sweaters
forever.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:53.060
Well, w-what do you mean? Elsie?
Christmas what?

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.466
Nutmeg!

01:08:58.568 --> 01:08:59.834
<i> What do I want?</i>

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.769
What kind
of candy-cane question is that?

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:04.906
I know what I want.
I want to go home!

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:10.645
Oh, frost you, snow guy.
And frost this place.

01:09:14.084 --> 01:09:15.917
I am never getting home.

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:29.264
Mayor Carmen's voice
was pitch perfect tonight.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.599
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, yes, yes.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.773
What are you doing here, pet?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.675
What are you doing?

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.278
- I don't know.
- Oh, you look so sad.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.613
I-I-I'll make hot chocolate.

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.349
My current problem
is beyond hot chocolate.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.353
I don't understand.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:55.456
No problem
is beyond hot chocolate.

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:57.859
Tsk. And that's the problem.

01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:01.196
Okay, now,
now I really don't understand.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:02.697
I know.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:07.368
I miss you guys.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.137
Well, we're right here.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.706
Not these yous.
I miss the real you.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:15.210
I miss your laugh

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:16.711
and your opinions.

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:20.348
If the real you
could hear me say that,

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.718
I would get such an earful
of "I told you so."

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:34.796
I love you guys.

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:37.799
I don't tell you enough.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:39.601
- We love you, too.
- We love you, too.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:14.936
Darcy?

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:21.509
May I?

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.357
I'm worried about ya.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:39.160
We're all worried about ya.

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:40.194
We all love you, Darcy,

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:44.299
but we can tell you're unhappy.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.901
And we haven't been dancing
in days.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.036
I don't understand
what's changed,

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.804
but...

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:52.507
I want to fill you
with comfort and joy.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.975
Tell me how.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:57.779
I'm not really sure.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:04.118
Well, I have an idea.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.820
Are you willing
to try something?

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:09.991
Trust me.

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:24.672
You're gonna look
like Cinderella.

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:28.309
- Yeah.
- Those beautiful soft curls.

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.678
The curls
are coming out really nicely.

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.483
So pretty.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:41.422
What does it say?

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.147
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

our very own Miss Christmas.

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.867

Merry Christmas, Darcy.

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.999
Mom, dad, it's beautiful.

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:34.135
It's not perfect, but...

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:35.837
I love it.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.238
You put on the finishing touch.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.541
- Thanks.
- Where should it go?

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:41.642
Right there.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:44.178

- Yeah. I know, right?
- Ooh. Oh, I like that.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.341
- You like it? Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah, it's very good, you.

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:15.109
Well, what about this one?

<i>♪ O night divine ♪</i>

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:24.552

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:27.522
Annoying.
Don't. Don't throw at me.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.524
I'd be so upset
if you throw that back at me.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.426

- Yeah, I would. No!

- Tom--
- I know, it's overwhelming.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:59.921
- Uh, n-no--
- Darcy...

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:03.357
Would you do me the great honor
of marrying me?

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:04.859
Uh...

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:12.867
No.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.169
Sorry?

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.605
I don't love you.

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:20.675
I-I don't understand.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:24.278
- Uh, we're perfect together.
- No.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.081
We're the same puzzle piece.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:28.783
I, I need to be with someone

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:32.353
who pushes me
out of my comfort zone,

01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:33.588
who makes me a better person,

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.290
who reminds me

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:38.326
that perfect isn't about

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:40.661
how something looks,

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.830
it's about how it feels.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.500
But we gave you everything
you could possibly dream of.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:50.004
What I want isn't a dream.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.038
It's reality.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.374
It's messy and difficult

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:56.277
and wonderful.

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:00.948
It's my mom full of opinions

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:05.019
and my dad who laughs
too loud...

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:10.491
and my friend who is weird,

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:13.894
and dark and lovely

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:16.297
just as she is.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:17.798
As you all are.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:26.040
There isn't only one right way
to do Christmas.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:29.443
There are other sbesides y

01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:32.580
and other beverages
besides eggnog,

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:35.249
cider and hot chocolate.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.251
Break out of the box.

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:40.955
Let yourselves
build snow unicorns.

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:43.090
Wear a purple sweater.

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.092
I believed that Christmas
should be a certain way.

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:46.994
And I was wrong.

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:49.997
So wrong.

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:58.472
Darcy, don't go in that.

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.108
I think it's my way home.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.279
Thank you for everything.

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:07.882
Merry Christmas, Tom.

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:27.068
It was only a dream.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:29.303
It was only a...

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.272
Uh...

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.718
You two are not gonna cause
anymore trouble.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.724
I look ridiculous.

01:18:52.695 --> 01:18:54.095
Who cares?

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.453
Brandon?

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.190
Darcy?

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:28.929
I-I wasn't sure if I was
ever gonna see you again.

01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:32.600
I wasn't sure
you'd even want to.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:35.636
- W-well, uh, you know...
- I...

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:39.373
I'm sorry that I got hung up
on the idea of being perfect,

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:43.310
which is crazy
because there's no such thing.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:47.581
I've been holding back
all these years

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:51.652
because I've been afraid
of change.

01:19:51.754 --> 01:19:55.823
I've been afraid
of losing my best friend,

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:58.459
instead of realizing
that everything I want

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.528
is standing right here
in front of me.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.299
I love my best friend.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:08.636
I wanna kiss my best friend.

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.706
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

01:20:22.118 --> 01:20:24.919
So what is with this dress?

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:29.824
Oh, um, well, I was crowned
Miss Christmas Town.

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:32.359
And Tom proposed
in front of the whole town

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.662
while Carmen serenaded us.

01:20:34.764 --> 01:20:37.832
Tsk. So standard
Christmas Town stuff.

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.366
Yeah. Pretty much.

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:57.184
It makes me so happy
to see you with Brandon, love.

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.120
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
And you can say it.

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.323
- What?
- "I told you so."

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:06.227
- I would never.
- Mm-hmm. You were right.

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:10.164
Hey, Darcy. Where do you
want me to put this?

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:13.701
You decide.
I'm happy with whatever.

01:21:13.803 --> 01:21:15.369
Okay, you know I told you

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.504
I love you exactly
the way you were, right?

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.440
Aw, that's sweet.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.351
That is not that horrible
record of your mother's.

01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:32.086
- Is it?
- Yes. It is.

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:33.520
Darcy said I could play it

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:34.989
because it makes me
feel like Christmas.

01:21:35.091 --> 01:21:36.824
Well, then I get to play
my <i> Dogs Barking</i>

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.025
<i>Jingle Bells</i> album.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:39.994
- Not that awful--
- You know what?

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:42.730
We'll try it. I love you guys.

01:21:42.832 --> 01:21:44.231
You know,
there is an alternate universe

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.500
where you are very, very nice
to each other.

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:49.837
Let's try to tap into that, huh?
Merry Christmas.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.907
Kid's got a point.

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:56.010
Yes. You haven't food
in your teeth yet.

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:58.112
So there's that.

01:21:58.214 --> 01:21:59.747
Thanks.

01:21:59.849 --> 01:22:01.048
And the smell
of the Christmas tree

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.550
is overpowering
your terrible perfume.

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:05.252
So that's nice.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:11.425
- Merry Christmas, Bill.
- Merry Christmas, Sylvia.

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:14.061
I thought it wasn't a holiday
for you without a turkey.

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:15.796
Oh, I think it's gonna be
a very long time

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:17.464
before I feel like turkey again.

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:20.367
Hey, Darcy, who's
the extra place setting for?

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.469
Oh, just you wait.

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:27.041
- Hey, come on in.
- Hey. Thanks.

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:28.542
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey.

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:30.711
Hey, thanks so much
for inviting me, Darcy.

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:32.579
It's actually my first Christmas
not flying home,

01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:35.249
so I wasn't really sure
what I was gonna do.

01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:36.283
Yeah, come on in.

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:37.584
So glad you could join us, man.

01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:39.720
- You must be Brandon, right?
- Yeah.

01:22:39.822 --> 01:22:41.388
- Yeah, I've heard all about you.
- Cool.

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.091
Uh, Tom, I actually thought
you could sit over here.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:45.626
Next to Carmen.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:47.161
Yeah, sounds good.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:54.168
Everybody, thank you for coming

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:58.072
to our first Everybody's
Favorite Food Christmas.

01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:01.642
I'm so happy to be able to spend
this day with people I love.

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.077
- Hear, hear.
- Mm, hear, hear.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.012
- Cheers.
- Cheers everyone.

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:08.015
- Cheers.
- All right, dig in.

01:23:08.117 --> 01:23:09.516
- That was great!
- Oh, man.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.018
I could get used
to these kind of Christmases.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.087
Well, try not to get
too attached.

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:14.288
I might wanna change it up
next year.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:17.191
Yeah, well, whatever you want.

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.326
Whatever we want.

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:22.296
Darcy, where is
your Christmas village?

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:24.732
Oh, I decided it was time
to let that go.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:42.016
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:44.351
It's perfect.
