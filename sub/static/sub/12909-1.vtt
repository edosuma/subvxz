00:55.380 --> 00:57.850
- Want some, buddy?
- Cheers.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.690
This way, please.

01:37.740 --> 01:41.840
The doctor will be with you
soon to explain the procedure.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.500
Hi, I'm Mark. This is Laura.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.170
Hi, I'm Bruce.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.290
- Are you nervous?
- A little.

01:52.340 --> 01:55.690
It's OK. It's fine. I
studied medicine at uni.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.650
They do these things all the time.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.530
I asked when I got here.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.250
This drug we're testing is
actually made by a UK company.

02:02.300 --> 02:06.580
I wouldn't be surprised if British
doctors were overseeing things.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.570
How do? Am I the last one in?

02:11.620 --> 02:14.010
- Looks like it.
- I couldn't find the place.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.890
- You haven't done this before?
- You've got to be kidding!

02:16.940 --> 02:19.730
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't
spent all my cash. I'm skint.

02:19.780 --> 02:23.090
We get dinner, breakfast and
Â£600. That's my ticket home.

02:23.140 --> 02:26.810
- Where's home?
- Leeds. Can't you tell? Huh!

02:26.860 --> 02:28.650
I'm still not sure.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.490
Most of us won't even get the
real stuff, whatever it is.

02:31.540 --> 02:34.890
They just give you an injection and
then you lie down for a few hours.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.060
- How do you know?
- I've done it loads of times.

02:40.220 --> 02:42.170
Don't tell them, though.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.690
- What if it's dangerous?
- It's not dangerous.

02:45.740 --> 02:49.460
They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.
- You'll be fine.

02:52.140 --> 02:53.410
I'm Henry.

02:53.460 --> 02:56.090
Some of you may feel a little drowsy.

02:56.140 --> 02:58.490
That's nothing to worry about.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.480
If you drift off to sleep, that's fine.

03:02.860 --> 03:06.490
- Wake me up when it's all over, will you?
- When do we get out of here?

03:06.540 --> 03:09.010
- Lunchtime tomorrow morning.
- Is lunch included?

03:09.060 --> 03:12.570
If you want anything, you can just
ring the bell. Any other questions?

03:12.620 --> 03:15.930
Yeah. When do we get paid?

03:15.980 --> 03:19.450
- 'How long have you been travelling?
- 'Two weeks.'

03:20.800 --> 03:22.070
Enter!

03:28.420 --> 03:30.980
So, are we all set?

03:32.660 --> 03:35.330
- Yes, Dr Leese.
- Excellent.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.050
Then carry on.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.730
Did you see that?

04:46.700 --> 04:49.340
- What?
- One of them just left.

04:50.460 --> 04:54.160
Come on, we must find him
before Dr Leese gets back.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.930
Doctor!
- Have you seen one of the patients from Green Fern?

05:45.980 --> 05:48.780
No, sir. I was just about to go home.

05:49.940 --> 05:51.420
OK.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.740
Please, no!

06:16.780 --> 06:18.490
I don't want to drown no more

06:18.540 --> 06:20.690
I'm sick of the same old people

06:20.740 --> 06:23.010
The kind that'll sell your soul

06:23.060 --> 06:25.050
Trade it for a shining stone

06:25.100 --> 06:27.610
Ain't nothing in this life for free

06:27.660 --> 06:30.130
Running from the greatest evil

06:30.180 --> 06:32.370
It finally dawned on me

06:32.420 --> 06:34.490
A man's got to fight temptation

06:34.540 --> 06:38.850
Keep the wolves from the door

06:38.900 --> 06:43.130
I hear them scratching
like I don't know better

06:43.180 --> 06:48.090
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?

06:48.140 --> 06:54.100
It won't be long before I
cave in and open up the door.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.130
Ah! Horrible weather!

07:25.180 --> 07:28.210
I know, I've been standing
in it for the last half-hour.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.530
Oh, I'm sorry. Here you are.

07:30.580 --> 07:34.450
What's this?
- It's an After Eight. I was just having dinner.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.410
- Very nice.
- What we got, then?

07:36.460 --> 07:38.800
Suicide, by the look of it.

07:39.380 --> 07:41.010
15 floors.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.370
- Name?
- Flaxton Court.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.410
No, the body, not the building.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.450
Oh, er... Mark Henson. I got his wallet.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.610
Also, an electronic door
pass from a secondary school.

07:52.660 --> 07:54.250
Must have been a teacher.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.890
Could've been a cook.
Mustn't jump to conclusions.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.690
What, like he did?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.290
Yeah, well, er... check this place out

08:02.340 --> 08:05.270
and then send uniform
round to next of kin.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.730
Heywood.

08:06.780 --> 08:10.090
- Er... excuse me, sir.
- Who are you and what do you want?

08:10.140 --> 08:13.500
- Er... Sayyad, sir.
- Is that a greeting, or is that your name?

08:14.900 --> 08:18.090
- PC Sayyad.
- PC Sayyad. That's right.

08:18.140 --> 08:20.450
- Are you the first attending officer?
- Er... no, sir.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.740
- So, why are you talking to me, then?
- I don't think he jumped, sir.

08:25.180 --> 08:26.570
Oh, you've got some other theory

08:26.620 --> 08:29.570
about how he ended up splattered
across the pavement, have you

08:29.620 --> 08:30.970
He was pushed.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.900
No! Please!

08:35.620 --> 08:37.409
What makes you think that?

08:37.460 --> 08:40.610
I was second on the scene and I took his pulse.
- Had one, did he?

08:40.659 --> 08:45.210
No, sir. He was dead
by the time I got here.

08:45.260 --> 08:47.530
But there was something on his skin.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.650
Some sort of adhesive.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.600
What are you talking about?

08:54.420 --> 08:57.570
I mean, it was like there had been
adhesive tape around his wrists.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.090
Like he was tied up?

08:59.140 --> 09:01.730
So, where is this tape?

09:01.780 --> 09:04.610
- Well, I don't know, I...
- So, you examined the body,

09:04.660 --> 09:07.090
you found traces of
something on the wrists,

09:07.140 --> 09:10.290
so, why have you left him there?!
Why haven't the hands been bagged?!

09:10.340 --> 09:13.540
Well, I...
- Call to Forensics, all right?! Do it now!

09:19.180 --> 09:21.890
- What was that all about?
- Some bloody amateur.

09:21.940 --> 09:25.090
- I need you to bag the hands.
- We'll bag them straightaway.

09:25.140 --> 09:28.140
- Adhesive tape?
- Could've been anything.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.740
Let's check the roof.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.890
You all right, Derek?

09:57.940 --> 10:01.040
You'd think they'd have
a lift that worked.

10:01.420 --> 10:03.370
You didn't come up here, then.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.360
I did come here, I didn't see anything.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.010
Maybe you didn't look.

10:45.340 --> 10:50.490
Someone comes to his flat, ties
up his hands, takes him up top.

10:50.540 --> 10:53.700
Why, Guv? What's the point? He's nobody.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.520
Well, someone thought
he was worth killing.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.780
That PC you were talking
to, what was he called?

11:20.500 --> 11:22.690
Light 'em up

11:22.740 --> 11:25.340
We running London town

11:28.860 --> 11:33.020
We'll raise the underground

11:38.540 --> 11:40.610
We'll hit the ground

11:43.100 --> 11:47.180
We're gonna burn the place down

11:51.420 --> 11:54.620
Turn it up loud

11:56.220 --> 11:59.330
You ain't messing with a rascal...

11:59.380 --> 12:01.720
Read the sign, innit? Look.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.170
What?

12:06.500 --> 12:09.500
Look, you can't leave the bike here, man.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.650
You're late.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.570
And the Leech wants to see you.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.260
- When?
- Half an hour ago.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.930
Enter!

12:53.980 --> 12:57.090
You were wanting to see me, Mr Leese.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.450
Yes. Come in, Stefan. Close the door.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.530
Stefan Kowolski... is that right?
- Yes.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.170
You haven't been here long.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.130
Two weeks.

13:08.180 --> 13:10.130
You're temporary. From the agency?

13:10.180 --> 13:11.530
Yes.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.580
Agency sent me here.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.050
How long have you been in this country?

13:17.100 --> 13:19.650
I, erm, came here two year ago.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.810
- From Poland.
- Yes, sir.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.570
And you're interested
in a career in the NHS?

13:24.620 --> 13:26.570
In, erm, clinical pharmacy.

13:26.620 --> 13:29.490
Well, there's always openings
for bright, young people

13:29.540 --> 13:31.370
and you're doing very well.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.170
You might want to take a look at your English, though.
- Sir?

13:34.220 --> 13:37.370
You typed up this report to the
North London Cancer Network Board?

13:37.420 --> 13:40.360
- Yes.
- There were quite a few errors.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.530
I, erm...

13:44.580 --> 13:45.850
I don't see.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.650
Third line. Cytotoxins.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.490
That's "cyto" with a C, not an S.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.930
Ah, yes.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.010
There's a couple more.

13:56.060 --> 14:00.290
Top of that paragraph. There's
only one S in "aseptic".

14:00.340 --> 14:03.890
And there should be two T's in Dr Bennett.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.010
I'm, erm, sorry.

14:06.060 --> 14:09.250
If you want a full-time job,
you'll have to try a little harder.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.210
If you're prescribing
drugs, the smallest mistake

14:12.260 --> 14:14.490
can have serious consequences.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.970
Yes, sir.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.170
Of course, there's not many

14:17.220 --> 14:19.090
permanent contracts around at the moment.

14:19.140 --> 14:23.450
It won't be easy, but I might be
able to help you, as a friend.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.770
Mr Leese...

14:25.820 --> 14:28.530
I'd like to get to know
you a bit better, Stefan.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.890
I think we can help each other...
- No!

14:30.940 --> 14:33.930
Is not right. - I'm sorry? - I'm
sorry, Mr Leese. I'm not like that.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.250
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you do with your hand.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.970
I don't know what you're talking
about. This isn't good enough.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.220
Do it again. Now get out.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.250
'I'm not going back.'

15:16.300 --> 15:19.850
I didn't join the Serious Fraud
Office to be a typist, Marcus.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.650
- You ARE going back.
- Why?

15:22.700 --> 15:26.370
Because we've actually got
someone inside. That's you.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.570
Leese has accepted you.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.290
And you're close to him.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.890
Too bloody close!

15:31.940 --> 15:35.410
Marcus, I've got that intel you
wanted. Capitax Enterprises.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.330
Thank you, Alison.

15:38.140 --> 15:41.250
You want to get Leese? You
want to bring him down?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.050
Yeah.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.490
Then don't say a word to
Eleanor about what happened.

15:46.540 --> 15:47.980
OK?

15:50.060 --> 15:52.800
And thanks, Stefan. We owe you one.

15:55.740 --> 15:59.820
'Tell me something, Arrash. Why
did you want to be a policeman?'

16:01.660 --> 16:03.970
I don't want to be a policeman.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.930
I want to be a detective.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.850
OK. Why do you want to be a detective?

16:12.140 --> 16:14.330
It's what I've always wanted.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.410
You did the detective course at Hendon.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.090
Top of the class.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.530
Commendations all round.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.290
From there, you went straight
to Bromley for three months.

16:24.340 --> 16:26.570
That didn't work out too well.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.770
- Ah, it was all right.
- They didn't want you.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.450
They sent you back here.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.450
Yeah, but it was a three-month fill in, maternity leave.
- That's right.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.700
She went off and had a
little baby detective.

16:38.420 --> 16:41.220
But then she didn't go back to work.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.460
They got someone else in.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.290
I, erm...

16:48.340 --> 16:50.130
didn't know that.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.170
I'm telling you now.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.770
Thank you.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.010
I'm trying to help you, Arrash,

16:56.060 --> 16:59.060
although you probably
don't see it that way.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.859
There's a difference
between smart and smartarse.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.609
From what I hear from Bromley,

17:07.660 --> 17:10.760
they couldn't wait to see the back of you.

17:11.020 --> 17:15.010
If you're a TDC, you cannot
step on people's toes.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.660
How many interviews have you had?

17:19.420 --> 17:20.730
Four.

17:20.780 --> 17:23.319
That should tell you something.

17:24.980 --> 17:26.450
Listen...

17:27.220 --> 17:28.770
.. you're clever.

17:28.820 --> 17:33.980
You're good at the job. We both know
that. So, what are you doing wrong?

17:36.740 --> 17:42.170
Well, it seems that you conducted
yourself pretty well last night.

17:42.220 --> 17:45.180
The murder at Flaxton Court.

17:47.340 --> 17:49.570
They're saying it's a murder now.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.770
I've had a request in from a DI Heywood...

17:52.820 --> 17:55.170
offer of six months probationary.

17:55.220 --> 17:58.090
Starting when?
- They want to see you first thing Monday morning.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.340
That soon enough for you?

18:04.420 --> 18:05.810
Thank you, Sergeant.

18:05.860 --> 18:08.460
Arrash, don't screw it up.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.810
OK. This is going very well, isn't it?

18:17.860 --> 18:21.170
The Serious Fraud Office supplying the NHS

18:21.220 --> 18:23.010
with free secretarial assistance.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.370
But to be honest with you, I've
yet to be convinced that this man,

18:27.420 --> 18:31.130
David Leese, is our
best way into UK Remicon.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.930
And let's not forget they're
the ones we're after.

18:33.980 --> 18:37.410
David Leese is a chief pharmacist
for six London hospitals

18:37.460 --> 18:40.730
with a combined budget of
almost 150 million a year,

18:40.780 --> 18:44.370
and yet he's managing to spend almost
a third of it with the same company.

18:44.420 --> 18:49.650
All with UK Remicon, at prices
way above the generic brands.

18:49.700 --> 18:52.050
He's taking backhanders. Well, he must be.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.490
Isn't it obvious?

18:53.540 --> 18:56.730
UK Remicon are bribing him to
choose their products for the NHS.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.290
They're making millions.

18:58.340 --> 19:00.250
Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.530
You've issued a Section 2 on his accounts?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.970
- He has three bank accounts.
- Uh-huh.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.290
- Nothing.
- And his lifestyle?

19:09.340 --> 19:12.250
He drives a Porsche. He
eats in the best restaurants.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.730
- He has a second home in the country.
- He can afford to.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.650
He's earning 95,000 a year. And
he has a wife who also earns.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.370
He's married?

19:21.140 --> 19:24.010
- You sound surprised... why?
- Cos...

19:27.020 --> 19:28.290
What?

19:29.780 --> 19:31.920
Because he's a bastard.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.050
Eleanor, um...

19:35.100 --> 19:38.100
Can we have a word alone?.. Do you mind?

19:56.460 --> 20:00.610
Has something happened that I should know about?
- No.

20:00.660 --> 20:04.140
Meaning it hasn't happened
or I shouldn't know about it?

20:06.740 --> 20:07.930
OK.

20:07.980 --> 20:10.370
Let's talk about UK Remicon.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.170
A British company with a market
capitalisation of 50 billion.

20:14.220 --> 20:18.650
They employ 37,000 people in
England, Ireland and Scotland.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.130
- They're criminals.
- They're protected.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.890
As you'd expect, they have
some very powerful friends,

20:24.940 --> 20:26.410
in business and in government.

20:26.460 --> 20:31.330
Right now, I have three teams,
30 people, working on this.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.570
We've scanned over 10,000 documents,

20:33.620 --> 20:35.610
spent God knows how many man-hours,

20:35.660 --> 20:37.690
and you think I'm going to risk it all

20:37.740 --> 20:39.770
for your Batman and Robin antics?

20:39.820 --> 20:43.610
My Batman and Robin antics
are why you employed me.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.850
You go after UK Remicon
down the usual channels,

20:46.900 --> 20:48.490
you're going to get nowhere.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.410
Even if you get them to court,

20:50.460 --> 20:53.010
UK Remicon is too big, too smart.

20:53.060 --> 20:55.650
But Dr David Leese isn't.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.900
He's our way in.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.640
Two more weeks.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.610
Right.

21:08.660 --> 21:12.290
You need to take a look at his
private correspondence. Contacts.

21:12.340 --> 21:15.610
Find something, anything, that
links Dr Leese to UK Remicon.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.490
But how would I do that? How
do I get back into his office?

21:19.540 --> 21:21.010
You'll find a way.

21:21.060 --> 21:25.140
Oh, and, Stefan, be careful.

21:36.100 --> 21:39.740
So tell me, Henry, how was your day?

21:41.220 --> 21:42.890
Boring.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.050
- At the car wash?
- Yeah.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.970
What's it called again?

21:47.020 --> 21:48.490
Squeegees.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.740
That is a stupid name for a car wash.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.690
I want to see you.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.170
I know.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.970
I drove all that way and
you weren't even there.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.530
If you start that again, I'm going to sign off.
- Don't!

22:04.580 --> 22:06.210
Don't...

22:06.260 --> 22:08.170
We'll be together soon.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.450
I wish I was with you now.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.610
And what would you do?

22:12.660 --> 22:15.500
If you were here, right now?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.730
I don't know.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.940
I bet I can guess.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.970
Anyway, I might be coming to London.

22:30.020 --> 22:31.610
When?

22:31.660 --> 22:33.050
Quite soon.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.450
Will I see you?

22:34.500 --> 22:37.770
It depends. Are you still on that stuff?

22:37.820 --> 22:40.810
What?
- The medicine. Are you still taking it?

22:40.860 --> 22:41.930
No.

22:41.980 --> 22:43.530
You shouldn't, Henry.

22:43.580 --> 22:46.880
It does things to you.
You shouldn't trust it.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.540
Henry?

22:58.820 --> 23:01.160
Henry, are you still there?

23:05.340 --> 23:06.900
Henry?

23:08.580 --> 23:10.090
Are you there?

23:10.140 --> 23:11.490
I have to go.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.090
I heard.

23:13.140 --> 23:14.650
I'll call you later.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.210
I know you will.

23:16.260 --> 23:18.010
I love you, Henry.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.700
I really do.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.770
Hello, love.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.530
You have a good day?

23:41.580 --> 23:43.250
Yeah.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.170
It was all right.

23:46.380 --> 23:50.980
- Who was that you were talking to just now?
- There was no-one.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.100
Right. I'll make supper.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.970
By the way, I've just noticed the car.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.650
What about it?

24:02.700 --> 24:05.770
- It's got a big dent in it.
- What?

24:05.820 --> 24:07.610
On the front bonnet.

24:07.660 --> 24:11.530
- Are you saying I did it?
- I just wondered...

24:11.580 --> 24:15.850
You think I'd have bashed the car and I wouldn't have told you?
- No.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.850
I only just noticed it myself

24:17.900 --> 24:19.970
and I was wondering how
it happened. That's all.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.650
- I'd have noticed if I'd hit something.
- It's just that...

24:22.700 --> 24:26.300
Why do you have to make
such a big deal out of it?

24:29.380 --> 24:31.100
You're right.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.450
I'll make supper.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.540
'Alison...?'

24:45.500 --> 24:48.450
Can you get this for
me? I need a Section 2.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.810
Who's Elizabeth Leese?

24:50.860 --> 24:53.890
Erm, David Leese works for the
City of London Health Trust.

24:53.940 --> 24:56.090
- She's his wife.
- And you think he might be

24:56.140 --> 24:58.490
running something through her accounts?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.650
I'm looking for any
connection to UK Remicon.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.450
- I'll get on to them.
- Great.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.490
- Stefan...
- What?

25:04.540 --> 25:07.290
I haven't seen you around
much the last two weeks.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.210
What have you been doing?

25:09.260 --> 25:11.930
Working for Marcus. Why
do you want to know?

25:11.980 --> 25:14.090
I just wondered.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.770
Do you fancy dinner next week?

25:16.820 --> 25:20.210
Tuesday. My brother and his
girlfriend are coming round.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.170
- Tuesday?
- Yeah.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.820
- Yeah. All right.
- Great.

26:17.060 --> 26:18.850
Oh...

26:18.900 --> 26:20.610
What are you doing?

26:20.660 --> 26:22.660
Kamil, shut the door!

26:38.700 --> 26:42.170
English, Jan. Remember?
We speak in English.

26:42.220 --> 26:48.090
The landlord call. He
want to, erm, put up rent.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.490
What did you tell him?

26:56.860 --> 27:00.730
I tell him, erm, call back, speak to you.

27:00.780 --> 27:03.010
Toilet broken.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.570
This place stinks!

27:22.660 --> 27:26.970
Who's here?
- Aunt Darya, Aunt Minoo and two people from Mum's work.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.850
- Why?
- It's her birthday. - Whose?

27:29.900 --> 27:32.170
I don't know. One of them.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.170
Arrash! There you are!

27:38.220 --> 27:39.970
Come in. Your aunts are here.

27:40.020 --> 27:42.010
Aunt Darya. Aunt Minoo.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.050
And this is Mrs Clayton
who works in my office.

27:45.100 --> 27:48.490
Your mother's told me so much about you, Arrash.
- Dinner's nearly ready.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.130
Are you going to get changed?

27:50.180 --> 27:55.770
- Oh, Mum, I've got to do my bike.
- Now? - I've got the race tomorrow.

27:55.820 --> 27:58.490
Gerald used to like
bicycling, didn't you, Gerald.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah...

28:02.700 --> 28:04.860
All right. Ten minutes.

28:07.140 --> 28:09.140
I'll get you a beer.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.370
'Mr Menakis,'

28:11.420 --> 28:13.090
you can't do this!

28:13.140 --> 28:16.290
We have a fixed-term agreement which
runs for another three months!

28:16.340 --> 28:18.290
'I told you the rent would rise.'

28:18.340 --> 28:20.410
No. No. You never said that.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.970
Anyway, you have to give
us notice. That's the law!

28:24.020 --> 28:26.930
'Don't tell me about the
law. I know the law.'

28:26.980 --> 28:29.810
We're already paying you enough.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.060
We can't afford any more.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.170
Here.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.040
Thanks.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.970
I got some news today.

28:55.020 --> 28:57.090
Oh, yeah, what's that?

28:58.660 --> 29:00.410
I'm moving to CID.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.540
What? You've got another placement?

29:05.220 --> 29:06.970
Six months as a TDC.

29:07.020 --> 29:10.410
That's brilliant, Rash.
That's really great.

29:10.460 --> 29:14.160
I can't believe you're
sitting out here by yourself.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.060
This time...

29:21.020 --> 29:23.560
.. I just want to get it right.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.460
Come on, dinner will be ready.

30:59.740 --> 31:01.570
'All competitors, all competitors,

31:01.620 --> 31:05.890
'the 25 to 35 year category
race will begin in five minutes.

31:05.940 --> 31:09.050
'This is your five-minute
warning.' - Hey, Rash. - Hey.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.740
Just one moment.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.140
Hi.

31:26.380 --> 31:30.370
Hi.
- I haven't seen you at one of these before.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.730
- I haven't been to one before.
- So, are you just supporting someone?

31:33.780 --> 31:37.180
- Or are you here to have fun?
- <She's with me.

31:40.380 --> 31:43.140
Just here for fun, then.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.650
Who are you?

31:47.700 --> 31:49.500
I'm her brother.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.800
Brother and sister?

31:53.820 --> 31:55.420
That's nice.

31:57.180 --> 32:00.370
I'll, er, see you later.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.820
Yeah, if you can keep up.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
I was talking to her.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.050
Just chatting up the opposition?

32:19.100 --> 32:21.300
I wasn't chatting him up.

32:22.420 --> 32:24.490
He was chatting me up.

32:28.220 --> 32:29.820
Good luck.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.890
Come on, boys!

32:46.700 --> 32:49.490
'On your marks!

32:49.540 --> 32:51.010
'Get set!'

32:59.740 --> 33:01.410
Come on, Rash!

33:08.780 --> 33:10.450
Come on, Rash!

33:11.620 --> 33:12.960
See ya!

33:39.100 --> 33:41.420
Come on, Rash! Come on!

33:44.340 --> 33:46.620
Come on, Rash!

34:15.420 --> 34:18.290
- You were brilliant, Rash!
- Thanks.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.050
Hold this.

34:25.860 --> 34:29.380
Congratulations. - What do
you mean? - You came third.

34:30.460 --> 34:32.850
- I came second. YOU came third.
- We'll see.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.010
And I'd have come first if
you hadn't got in my way.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.330
- I didn't get in your way.
- You swerved in front of me!

34:37.380 --> 34:41.380
Well, if I was in front of
you, I must have come second.

34:43.020 --> 34:45.770
You know what? It doesn't matter.
It doesn't make a difference.

34:45.820 --> 34:48.560
Are you going to be at East London?

34:48.780 --> 34:50.980
- The triathlon?
- Yeah.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.880
I'll see you there.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.300
Yeah, you'll see my back!

35:12.300 --> 35:14.610
Arrash Sayyad.

35:14.660 --> 35:17.170
Where does that name come from?

35:17.220 --> 35:19.250
Ah, I was born here.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.900
Um, my parents came from Tehran.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.100
Your dad a policeman?

35:26.140 --> 35:27.820
Um, he was.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.730
Bromley didn't like you
very much, did they?

35:32.780 --> 35:35.580
I didn't like them very much either.

35:36.660 --> 35:39.600
What, you think you can pick and choose?

35:39.740 --> 35:43.340
- I didn't ask to leave.
- No. No, I can see that.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.250
You'll be working with DS Sands,
standing in for DC Westfield.

35:52.300 --> 35:56.530
- He's on sick leave.
- Ah, thank you, Guv. I'm grateful.

35:56.580 --> 35:59.490
Yeah, well, don't be. Some little
bastard stuck a knife in him,

35:59.540 --> 36:00.650
and if you want the truth,

36:00.700 --> 36:03.800
I'd rather Jack was
standing here than you.

36:07.100 --> 36:10.570
That was good work the other
night. The sticky tape.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.130
I'm not saying we wouldn't
have got there in the end,

36:13.180 --> 36:15.570
but you were quick off
the mark. I like that.

36:15.620 --> 36:19.260
So, I want you to work on
the Henson investigation.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.890
You got a problem with that, Derek?

36:22.940 --> 36:25.580
No, Guv. Not at all.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.780
That's going to be your spot there.
- Right.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.530
Witness statements. House-to-house.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.810
CCTV. Pathology report.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.490
Henson's medical records.
Go through them all.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.210
I'm sorry about DC Westfield.

36:48.260 --> 36:50.130
What do you know?

37:02.140 --> 37:04.140
'I've got good news.'

37:04.660 --> 37:07.660
- What's that?
- 'I'm coming to London.'

37:08.740 --> 37:10.010
When?

37:11.340 --> 37:13.010
'This evening.'

37:13.060 --> 37:14.490
Can I see you?

37:14.540 --> 37:18.440
'Of course you can. Why do
you think I'm telling you?'

37:18.820 --> 37:20.690
Where will you be?

37:21.380 --> 37:23.980
'Can you meet me off the train?'

37:25.100 --> 37:26.380
When?

37:27.540 --> 37:28.880
'6.30.'

37:30.180 --> 37:32.050
I can't. I'm working.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.050
'It's a car wash, Henry.
They won't miss you.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.900
'They don't even know you're there.'

37:40.660 --> 37:42.530
Of course you can.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.490
- 'Which station?'
- Canary Wharf.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.130
Come down to the platform. East-bound.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.290
Remember. 6.30.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.610
'Why?'

37:53.500 --> 37:55.570
Because it's romantic, Henry.

37:55.620 --> 37:59.090
You can get a bus to the
station, come down the escalator

37:59.140 --> 38:01.540
and meet me on the platform.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.410
- 'All right.'
- And don't tell anyone!

38:05.460 --> 38:07.660
It's just you and me. Hm?

38:08.380 --> 38:10.650
I've got to go. Bye.

38:13.660 --> 38:15.600
Sweet little Henry.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.240
He'll be there.

38:26.740 --> 38:29.010
The Serious Fraud Office
is bad for business

38:29.060 --> 38:30.890
and that's bad for government.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.010
Which is why I'm here.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.420
Have you got any news for me?

38:37.100 --> 38:39.500
Have you heard from them yet?

38:40.300 --> 38:42.650
The SFO? Nothing. I
assume they're trawling

38:42.700 --> 38:44.290
through our banking records.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.780
Hmm, company AND individual.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.850
How are things at UK Remicon, William?

38:51.900 --> 38:53.250
I want them off our back.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.770
The trouble with The Serious Fraud Office

38:55.820 --> 38:58.980
is that once they get
started, they don't stop.

39:01.620 --> 39:04.810
Gemma, I'm off to Southwark, I
probably won't be back today.

39:04.860 --> 39:09.060
- So, can you leave that stuff on my desk?
- Yes, Mr Leese.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.650
'I have a source within the SFO

39:12.700 --> 39:15.370
'and I hear they've
moved into a new phase.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.610
'They may have gone undercover.

39:17.660 --> 39:20.930
'It's going to make it
harder to protect you.'

39:20.980 --> 39:23.130
You're in government. Can't you stop them?

39:23.180 --> 39:26.290
They're a completely independent
organisation, William.

39:26.340 --> 39:29.490
They report to the Attorney
General. They do not work for him.

39:29.540 --> 39:32.010
- You know that.
- Even so...

39:32.100 --> 39:34.770
Well, if they do something stupid.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.980
'If they step out of line,
we may be able to step in.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.650
'What exactly are they looking for?

39:42.700 --> 39:45.290
'Financial fraud, business malpractice,

39:45.340 --> 39:49.300
'bribing or coercing of
doctors or NHS officials.'

39:50.580 --> 39:53.330
Nothing, I'm sure, that would
concern anyone at UK Remicon.

39:53.380 --> 39:54.770
- Of course not.
- Unless, of course,

39:54.820 --> 39:57.920
there was something you
weren't telling me.

40:05.860 --> 40:07.570
Stefan?

40:07.620 --> 40:09.490
What do you want?

40:10.460 --> 40:12.690
I, um...

40:12.740 --> 40:15.010
I leave this for Mr Leese.

40:17.260 --> 40:19.770
He's gone for the day. I'll take it.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.690
Oh. Thank you...

40:21.740 --> 40:23.010
Gemma.

40:39.260 --> 40:41.200
Where are we going?

40:47.340 --> 40:48.730
Flaxton Court?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.450
That's right.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.290
I... just wondered.

40:52.340 --> 40:55.970
Do you mind if we keep the
chit-chat down to a minimum?

40:56.020 --> 40:57.250
I'll be honest with you.

40:57.300 --> 41:00.650
The last thing I need right now
is a Trainee Detective Constable,

41:00.700 --> 41:03.130
especially one who thinks
he knows everything.

41:03.180 --> 41:07.180
- Nothing personal.
- It sounds pretty personal to me...

41:07.700 --> 41:09.530
You might be right.

41:09.580 --> 41:11.410
I spoke to Bromley.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.050
I know all about you.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.500
And if I want conversation,
I've got the radio.

41:36.940 --> 41:39.280
Er, have forensics been in?

41:39.860 --> 41:41.210
No, they haven't.

41:41.260 --> 41:44.450
I mean, why would they need
fingerprints or luminol

41:44.500 --> 41:47.050
or a complete bleeding crime report?

41:47.100 --> 41:48.650
Of course they've been in

41:48.700 --> 41:50.170
(Pillock.)

41:57.460 --> 41:59.690
Er, what are we looking for?

41:59.740 --> 42:02.840
We're looking for the
reason he was killed.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.850
Mark Henson.

42:06.900 --> 42:10.620
Teaches French and German
at a local secondary.

42:11.740 --> 42:14.140
No girlfriend. No boyfriend.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.170
Nice little flat.

42:17.220 --> 42:18.690
Big mortgage, though.

42:18.740 --> 42:21.840
Must be getting some
help from Mum and Dad.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.320
What are you doing?

42:31.820 --> 42:33.810
Er, just taking a photo.

42:33.860 --> 42:36.600
What, as a souvenir? Just leave it!

42:43.340 --> 42:45.650
Maybe we should talk to
someone at his school.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.410
Do you think so? Really

42:48.460 --> 42:51.450
Ah, why didn't I think of that?

42:51.500 --> 42:53.020
Come on!

43:04.300 --> 43:06.290
Mark had been here for two years.

43:06.340 --> 43:08.680
We were completely shocked.

43:09.380 --> 43:12.020
- This is his classroom?
- Yes.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.690
I'm going to need to see his locker.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.980
The quiet room. Any personal possessions.
- Of course.

43:19.620 --> 43:23.340
Had he...? Had he been behaving
strangely in any way or, um...

43:25.940 --> 43:29.450
- .. had anything upset him?
- I wasn't aware of anything untoward.

43:29.500 --> 43:33.210
He'd just agreed to direct Bugsy Malone.
- I did Bugsy!

43:33.260 --> 43:36.130
- Oh, what part were you?
- Dandy Dan.

43:36.180 --> 43:40.090
Excuse me? I don't think he was
killed because of a school play.

43:43.900 --> 43:45.730
Laura! Come in.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.690
This is Laura Jones,

43:47.740 --> 43:49.530
she works in our maths department.

43:49.580 --> 43:53.610
She knew Mark best. This is
Detective Sergeant Sands and...

43:53.660 --> 43:55.530
How did you know Mark Henson?

43:55.580 --> 43:58.420
Er, we did teacher training together.

43:59.660 --> 44:02.860
After that, we spent the summer travelling.
- Where were you?

44:04.100 --> 44:06.850
- What?
- When you went travelling?

44:06.900 --> 44:08.770
We were in India.

44:10.740 --> 44:14.250
- When was this?
- Six years ago.

44:14.300 --> 44:17.450
But we kept in touch. We stayed friends.

44:17.500 --> 44:21.410
- So, what can you tell us about him?
- Was he worried about anything?

44:21.460 --> 44:23.170
Or did he have anything on his mind?

44:23.220 --> 44:25.450
Three weeks ago, he got quite upset.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.170
We both were.

44:27.220 --> 44:28.970
Why?

44:29.020 --> 44:32.530
Someone we knew got killed in an accident.

44:32.580 --> 44:34.250
He was a friend.

44:34.300 --> 44:37.340
- Who was he?
- His name was Steve Mullen.

44:38.860 --> 44:41.650
I can't believe it, both of them...

44:41.700 --> 44:44.290
You don't have to say any
more if you prefer not to.

44:44.340 --> 44:46.540
Yes. She does, actually.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.690
What happened to Steve Mullen?

44:49.740 --> 44:51.860
A car accident.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.770
A hit-and-run.

45:12.300 --> 45:14.770
Henry, I want to talk to you.>

45:20.460 --> 45:24.130
Mr Robinson called me from
the car wash. What happened?

45:37.740 --> 45:39.170
I didn't like working there.

45:39.220 --> 45:41.530
You could have talked to me!

45:41.580 --> 45:43.090
You don't listen.

45:43.140 --> 45:44.850
That's not true!

45:44.900 --> 45:46.330
I got you that job.

45:46.380 --> 45:49.850
I know it's not much, washing
cars, but if you don't work,

45:49.900 --> 45:52.690
you're not going to have
control over your life.

45:52.740 --> 45:55.860
It's not just about the
money! It's important!

45:57.460 --> 46:00.650
Why haven't you been
taking your medication?

46:00.700 --> 46:02.130
You've been in my room?!

46:02.180 --> 46:04.610
I'm trying to look after
you. It's all I ever do!

46:04.660 --> 46:06.660
Why have you stopped?

46:07.700 --> 46:09.640
It doesn't help me.

46:10.940 --> 46:14.180
All these big pharma companies,
they want to control me.

46:15.620 --> 46:17.210
They just make things worse.

46:17.260 --> 46:18.650
Who said that?

46:18.700 --> 46:20.840
That's not you talking.

46:21.620 --> 46:24.620
- Who's been telling you that?
- No-one.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.890
It's that computer of yours.

46:26.940 --> 46:29.890
You spend hours upstairs in your room.

46:29.940 --> 46:32.220
You're talking to someone.

46:33.860 --> 46:36.260
Why don't you leave me alone?

46:37.540 --> 46:40.050
I didn't like the job.

46:40.100 --> 46:41.850
I left.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.970
I can get another one.

47:19.820 --> 47:22.290
'Henry, I'll see you very soon.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.440
'Canary Wharf. On the platform. Remember.'

47:29.820 --> 47:31.650
A bit of a coincidence.

47:31.700 --> 47:32.970
What?

47:33.900 --> 47:35.530
That Mark Henson's pushed off a roof

47:35.580 --> 47:37.650
and just three weeks
before, someone he knew,

47:37.700 --> 47:41.400
someone he was close to,
is killed in a hit-and-run.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.370
Get onto traffic command.

47:43.420 --> 47:45.610
I want all the details
about Mullen's death.

47:45.660 --> 47:49.650
- Witness statements, CCTV, the usual.
- All right.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.400
And in the meantime, keep
your opinions to yourself.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
All right, Dandy Dan?

48:43.540 --> 48:45.210
There you go.

49:04.340 --> 49:07.740
Here's the Luton collision report you asked for.
- Thanks.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.170
I'm sorry.

49:47.220 --> 49:49.760
I'm going to be late tonight...

49:50.820 --> 49:52.410
Paperwork, yeah.

49:52.460 --> 49:54.730
I'll be as quick as I can.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.370
'I can't believe it,'

50:07.420 --> 50:09.160
both of them...

50:48.500 --> 50:49.970
Oh, sh...

50:51.700 --> 50:53.090
Oh!

50:53.140 --> 50:54.940
Er, Mrs Philips?

50:56.620 --> 50:58.650
I will deal with this in the morning.

50:58.700 --> 51:00.730
I just need to have
another word with Laura.

51:00.780 --> 51:03.930
- She has left. You just missed her.
- Where does she live?

51:03.980 --> 51:06.530
- Well, I...
- It's really important, Mrs Philips.

51:06.580 --> 51:08.410
Two people are dead.

51:08.460 --> 51:10.890
Do you think she could be in danger?

51:10.940 --> 51:12.370
I just need to speak to her.

51:12.420 --> 51:15.820
Well, she has a flat in South London.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.890
Here.

51:18.940 --> 51:20.450
- Is this her mobile?
- Yes.

51:20.500 --> 51:23.700
You might be lucky, you
might just catch her.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.010
Thank you.

51:25.060 --> 51:28.050
Yes, Mum. I'm just at the station.

51:28.100 --> 51:30.610
I'll call round later. All right?

51:30.660 --> 51:33.570
- '.. currently unavailable...'
- Voicemail.

51:33.620 --> 51:37.210
She gets the DLR to Canary Wharf.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.930
It's just two minutes up the road.

51:51.300 --> 51:54.490
'Move away from the edge of Platform 2.

51:54.540 --> 51:56.970
'This train is ready to leave.

51:57.020 --> 52:00.570
'The next train will
leave in two minutes.'

53:26.980 --> 53:29.650
Laura? Laura! Laura? Laura! Laura!

53:30.660 --> 53:32.060
Laura?

53:40.060 --> 53:41.730
Laura? Laura!

53:42.860 --> 53:45.400
Has anyone called an ambulance?

53:55.820 --> 53:57.130
I'm Arrash Sayyad.

53:57.180 --> 53:59.570
Stefan Kowolski. I work for
the Serious Fraud Office.

53:59.620 --> 54:01.450
- Name?
- David Leese.

54:01.500 --> 54:04.250
It can't have been an accident.
She was killed. She was murdered.

54:04.300 --> 54:06.490
You used them in some
sort of medical experiment.

54:06.540 --> 54:07.930
That's what connects them.

54:07.980 --> 54:11.340
There are two other people in this
photograph. Find out who they are.
