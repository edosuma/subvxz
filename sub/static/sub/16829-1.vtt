WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.167
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...

00:02.169 --> 00:05.404
Will you please marry me?
No.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.438
I can't.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.073
I'm married to someone else.

00:08.075 --> 00:11.110
Ralph, I was so worried
about you.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.177
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.445
I'm glad you're okay, too.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.080
You took my son
into the canyons,

00:15.082 --> 00:17.182
near landslides
and accidents,

00:17.184 --> 00:19.218
and you brought him home safe.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.186
Meet my new trainee.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.454
Tim Armstrong.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.023
Hello.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.758
So I wanted to ask if you,

00:25.760 --> 00:27.259
uh, would like to go to the

00:27.261 --> 00:29.762
lake Tahoe jazz
and heritage festival.

00:29.764 --> 00:31.063
Oh, I...

00:33.100 --> 00:34.800
Wi-with Tim.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.268
You're a genetic fluke,
so freaking what?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.302
It doesn't matter.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.671
What matters in life
is love.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.173
You pushed your love
out the door

00:41.175 --> 00:43.042
to spend the weekend
with another man.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.779
Come on, where
are you going?

00:46.781 --> 00:48.213
I'm gonna stop Paige.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.383
I love her.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.584
I'm a moron.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.289
(Jet engines whooshing)

00:57.291 --> 00:59.792
Man:
<i> Blackjack 1, am I imagining</i>
<i> things, or did you just pull</i>

00:59.794 --> 01:01.693
a quick nose-up with
a tight rollback back there?

01:01.695 --> 01:04.129
Roger that, Blackjack 2,
and if I were a mig,

01:04.131 --> 01:06.298
I'd have set up
for a high-side gun pass

01:06.300 --> 01:07.833
and lit you up.
Negative.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.367
I would have barrel-rolled
right out of the situation.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.570
(Instrument panel beeping)

01:11.572 --> 01:13.138
What the hell?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.540
Was that a curse word,
Blackjack 1?

01:14.542 --> 01:16.275
I don't think
I've ever heard you...

01:16.277 --> 01:17.142
What's wrong?
(Instruments beeping)

01:17.144 --> 01:19.144
<i> I'm accelerating,</i>

01:19.146 --> 01:20.212
but not at my command.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.213
Plane is nonresponsive.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.214
Same here.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.449
Gaining altitude.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.886
Stick is dead.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.454
Lost all comms to ranger.
Can you connect with base?

01:28.456 --> 01:29.788
(Instruments beeping)

01:29.790 --> 01:31.090
No joy.
Okay.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.357
Stand by to eject.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.726
Punch-outs a no-go!

01:34.728 --> 01:36.795
(Jet engines rumbling)

01:40.334 --> 01:42.101
Woodrow, are you trying
to lock in on me?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.235
I'm not doing anything.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.503
My bird's gone rogue.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.606
June, get off of my six!

01:47.608 --> 01:48.807
Morales, my slammers
have gone hot.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.646
You have to shake me now.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.780
Female navigation voice:
Five miles from destination,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.315
Tahoe crystal lake resort.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.349
Almost there.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.184
What do I say when I see her?

01:59.186 --> 02:00.519
Poetry.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.720
Poetry?

02:01.722 --> 02:04.857
Paige, to Tim, please say<i> nada,</i>

02:04.859 --> 02:08.227
but say<i> sí</i> to my giant
medulla oblongata.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.728
How much Tequila have you had?

02:09.730 --> 02:10.863
Enough to write that poem.

02:10.865 --> 02:12.281
Look, Walt.

02:12.282 --> 02:13.698
Just speak from your heart.
Can you do that?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.501
No.
Then try this.

02:15.503 --> 02:19.771
You can't spell "hypothalamus"
without "us."

02:19.773 --> 02:21.840
Huh?

02:21.842 --> 02:23.208
Hello?

02:23.210 --> 02:25.511
Walt?

02:25.513 --> 02:28.247
You go get 'em, tiger.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.282
Okay.

02:31.886 --> 02:35.721
Let's find happy's hubby.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.590
Paige:
<i> You know, I can't remember</i>

02:37.591 --> 02:39.458
the last time I had
a nutsy cluster bar.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.592
I can't remember
the last time

02:40.594 --> 02:42.261
I had a date
go so sideways.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.795
(Chuckling):
Oh, come on,
it's not your fault.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.264
No, it's just,

02:45.266 --> 02:47.332
this place is famous
for its 24-hour dining room,

02:47.334 --> 02:49.801
so I figured we would
get a late meal,

02:49.803 --> 02:52.437
sit on the terrace
under the moonlight.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.439
Instead it's
nutsy cluster bars

02:54.441 --> 02:56.108
from the vending machine.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.776
(Laughing):
You could not predict
that the board of health

02:57.778 --> 02:59.578
would close the place,
and, you know,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.513
the reservation mix-up
was a fluke.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.421
Let me ask you something.
Mm-hmm?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.656
Were you
a little bit relieved

03:10.658 --> 03:12.357
that they messed up
our adjoining suites?

03:13.327 --> 03:14.826
What?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.762
No. Why would...
Why would you ask that?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.564
(Exhales)
Honestly?

03:18.566 --> 03:21.500
I thought I picked up
on a vibe at the garage

03:21.502 --> 03:23.835
that maybe you wanted
to stay there.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.305
And... look,
i know

03:26.307 --> 03:28.574
this is weird, like, we've only
been on a couple of dates,

03:28.576 --> 03:32.411
and then Walter sends us on
some romantic weekend getaway.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.513
And, you know,
i thought maybe

03:34.515 --> 03:37.349
you would be relieved
that the only rooms they had

03:37.351 --> 03:39.351
were single rooms
on opposite sides

03:39.353 --> 03:40.586
of the resort.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.521
Look, what I'm trying
to say, Paige,

03:42.523 --> 03:46.959
is... I like you... a lot,

03:46.961 --> 03:49.595
and if there's anything

03:49.597 --> 03:53.599
holding you back in L.A.,
then just let me know.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.935
I'll understand.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.238
No.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.472
There's nothing
holding me back.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.375
You sure?

04:04.511 --> 04:05.344
Yes.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.013
Well, that is good news.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.504
(Phone rings)

04:32.506 --> 04:34.640
And that is cabe's ring.
(Paige chuckles)

04:34.642 --> 04:36.708
And I have to answer
cabe's ring.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.610
I'm so sorry.
Duty calls.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.746
Hey, boss man,
what's up?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.014
I hate to ruin your weekend,

04:42.016 --> 04:43.515
but I need you back here pronto.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.750
We got a problem.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.322
(Phone buzzes)

04:53.027 --> 04:54.393
(Phone beeps)

04:54.395 --> 04:56.361
Cabe, why are you
calling so late?

04:56.363 --> 04:57.729
Cabe:
Where the hell are you?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.398
I'm at the garage
and the doc said you went out

04:59.400 --> 05:00.399
and I need you back here now.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.068
Uh... might be a while.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.736
What's "a while"?

05:04.738 --> 05:06.905
Seven hours.
Cabe: Seven hours?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.640
What the hell are you doing
seven hours away from here?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.741
Tahoe.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.443
Oh, boy.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.744
Telling me.
Okay.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.346
You can destroy
your personal life later.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.315
Right now, I need you to get
to plimpton airfield.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.983
It's just south of the lake.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.618
I sent a plane to pick up
Paige and Tim.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.020
N... I... cannot get on a plane
with them.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.455
You can and you will.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.390
I need team scorpion
and all I've got

05:25.392 --> 05:26.925
is a drunk behaviorist.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.360
Hungover behaviorist.
(Bottle clatters)

05:30.564 --> 05:31.797
Happy and sly are on their way.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.498
I need you to move your ass

05:33.500 --> 05:35.434
because what I'm about
to tell you

05:35.435 --> 05:37.369
is gonna make all our other
cases look like warm-ups.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.403
Happy's on her way?

05:38.405 --> 05:40.088
Yeah.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.772
And you need a pot of coffee
and some mouthwash.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.008
In that order.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.046
Okay, strapped in,
ready to go.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.514
Can't. Still waiting
on one more.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.515
One more?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.416
Who?

05:51.418 --> 05:52.484
(Door closing)

05:52.486 --> 05:53.452
Hello.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.786
Hel-hello?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.855
What are you doing here?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.790
Well, all our talk
about jazz music

05:58.792 --> 06:01.493
made me want to go see
the festival, so here I am,

06:01.495 --> 06:04.096
but cabe called,
so no music for me.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.534
All right, wheels up.
Time's wasting.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.608
Cabe!

06:16.610 --> 06:18.477
We got here as fast as we could.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.544
You brought the kid?!

06:19.546 --> 06:20.712
He's 11.
I'm babysitting.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.664
I can't leave him alone.

06:22.665 --> 06:24.615
You were scared to take the bus
at night by yourself.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.585
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.053
Any developments
since you called, cabe?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.521
No. Admiral horton pace

06:29.523 --> 06:31.156
should be here shortly
to fill us in more.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.458
What we do know
is all signs point

06:33.460 --> 06:34.760
to the f-130s being hacked,

06:34.762 --> 06:35.994
and whoever did it

06:35.996 --> 06:37.629
has had them engaged
in a dogfight

06:37.631 --> 06:39.898
for the past hour
over the eastern conejo valley.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.566
They've worked
their way south

06:41.568 --> 06:43.602
to where they're just a few
miles from our current location.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.771
Waking up half of Los Angeles
in the process.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.606
I bet the press
is all over this.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.641
No, we told them that the jets
were running combat simulations.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.510
We can't have the world know
that we're not in control

06:51.512 --> 06:52.644
of our own warplanes.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.645
All other aircraft

06:53.647 --> 06:55.414
has been grounded and disabled.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.385
You look terrible.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.185
He's right, you look
like you're gonna be sick.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.422
Yeah, 'cause I'm looking at you
in pajamas.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.890
You know, we rushed over here.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.892
Where's happy?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.127
She's on her way.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.929
It should be
very comfortable.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.898
What about the others?

07:12.900 --> 07:13.965
Paige, Tim, Walter.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.967
They just landed
from Tahoe.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.436
They'll be here any minute.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.737
Walter went up to Tahoe?

07:19.673 --> 07:20.772
Oh, boy.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.607
Mom's gonna be confused.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.675
(Door opens)

07:37.858 --> 07:39.791
Navy personnel
will be here soon.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.093
Grab a coffee,
perk up.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.695
It's gonna be a long day.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.105
Before the others get here,
we should talk.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.708
Let's skip your rejection
of my proposal

07:56.710 --> 07:58.009
because you're married.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.845
Great surprise,
by the way,

07:59.847 --> 08:01.480
and get to the lies.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.014
I've never lied to you.
Really?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.516
I hacked L.A. county records.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.717
There's no marriage license
for you,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.185
so either you're not married

08:07.187 --> 08:08.653
or you deleted the evidence

08:08.655 --> 08:10.522
so I can't find out
who your better half is.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.625
One, I am married.
Two, I didn't delete anything.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.927
Three, I don't lie to you.
Four, I'm in love with you.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.664
That's gonna make things weird
for your anniversary, won't it?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.902
Is it Collins?

08:23.904 --> 08:25.770
What?
When he kidnapped me

08:25.772 --> 08:27.105
he said you couldn't say yes
to my proposal.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.824
Why would he say that?

08:28.825 --> 08:30.542
The same reason
he talks to sock puppets,

08:30.544 --> 08:32.210
because he's bat poop crazy.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.647
All right, you're being
truthful-- not Collins.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.583
Doc, look, do you trust me?

08:38.585 --> 08:39.784
No.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.219
Fine. Do you love me?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.888
Yeah.
Then if your love

08:42.890 --> 08:44.689
is stronger than your distrust,
please understand

08:44.691 --> 08:46.124
that I'm in a situation
with another guy

08:46.126 --> 08:47.993
who I don't love,
who I have never loved,

08:47.995 --> 08:50.095
but that's all
i can tell you.
Why?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.963
Toby, that's all I can tell you
right now,

08:51.965 --> 08:53.999
but if you give me
a little bit of time,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.667
I will fix it
and tell you everything,

08:55.669 --> 08:57.836
okay?

08:57.838 --> 09:00.138
Crap. Now I trust you,
too.
Good.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.741
Now, there are two f-130s
screaming across L.A.,

09:02.743 --> 09:04.709
so we've got more important
things to worry about.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.746
Walter:
<i> Sly,</i>

09:07.748 --> 09:08.847
cabe filled me in earlier.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.016
Right. On your way
back from Tahoe.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.050
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.552
Sly,

09:13.554 --> 09:15.220
while we're waiting for
the admiral to get here,

09:15.222 --> 09:17.322
link up to the naval base's
operating system.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.591
See if we can find a back door
into those planes.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.159
I am already into it.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.894
What is that nonsense?

09:22.895 --> 09:24.628
Uh, this is super fun guy
cuckoo Clay.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.897
I'm stressed
and it helps.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.099
Two-two hands.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.734
Okay, look, does anybody
have a read

09:29.736 --> 09:31.736
on where these plane are
right now?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.705
(Planes roaring overhead)

09:33.707 --> 09:35.207
There's your answer.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.708
I'm gonna look
for vulnerable ports

09:36.710 --> 09:38.677
on the military wireless
server networks.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.179
And I just got the Navy's
radar feed up on our monitors.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.783
They're circling L.A.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.821
Okay, how was the world's
most awkward plane ride?

09:51.858 --> 09:53.692
Oh, good gravy;
You didn't tell her.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.960
Refuse to engage.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.027
Oh, please.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.228
You could hack in your sleep.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.363
I'm hardly a distraction.

10:00.634 --> 10:05.136
You know, I read this article
about this guy in San Pedro,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.739
who has the two largest
aluminum foil balls in socal.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.874
He charges a buck
to see them.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.875
Do you know

10:10.877 --> 10:12.777
what I admire most
about this guy

10:12.779 --> 10:14.779
with those giant balls?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.915
You know what attribute
really stands out

10:16.917 --> 10:18.783
for the giant balls guy,
Walter?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.052
I will tell her how I feel
when I get the chance,

10:21.054 --> 10:23.154
but right now,
there are out of control f-130s

10:23.156 --> 10:24.789
screaming across L.A.,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.791
so we have more important things
to worry about.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.893
Where have I heard that before?

10:28.895 --> 10:30.228
(Door opens)

10:31.398 --> 10:32.263
Admiral.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.232
Cabe gallo. Any updates?

10:34.234 --> 10:37.235
No. All we could obtain is a
brief recording of the pilots.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.837
Morales:
Plane is nonresponsive!

10:38.839 --> 10:41.006
Woodrow:
Same here! Gaining altitude!

10:41.008 --> 10:43.775
Stick is dead!
After that,
the hackers cut the comms.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.744
Best tech minds in the
government couldn't crack it.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.780
Uh, we're the best tech minds
in the government.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.248
You being smart with me?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.183
Actually, we're
smart with everybody.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.655
The world's superpower
can't control its aviation,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.023
I'm getting sass from this guy

10:58.025 --> 10:59.691
and a giant baby
in his underwear?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.259
Cabe:
They don't mean

11:01.261 --> 11:04.396
any disrespect.
It's just them being themselves.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.399
Can I talk to you
for a second?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.706
Quick question.
Yeah.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.108
This might be the biggest case
that this team has ever had,

11:17.110 --> 11:20.945
and I'm worried that Walter
might be a little... unfocused.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.815
No matter what it is, Walter
always gets the job done, so...

11:23.817 --> 11:26.017
Yeah, well, what about him
just appearing in Tahoe,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.352
saying he was there
to hear jazz?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.720
I mean, do you believe that?

11:28.722 --> 11:29.954
I mean,
he obviously wanted

11:29.956 --> 11:31.456
to see you badly enough
that he was willing

11:31.458 --> 11:32.691
to drive through the night
to do it.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.092
So...
I don't know.
I...

11:34.094 --> 11:35.727
I hope not.
Things are much simpler

11:35.729 --> 11:37.062
if that's not the case.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.464
Really? How so?

11:43.837 --> 11:46.404
(Quietly): Hey. Did you, uh,
mess with my marriage records?

11:46.406 --> 11:49.074
Absolutely I did.
You want Toby to find out

11:49.076 --> 11:50.408
who you're really married to?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.910
Just focus
on the matter

11:51.912 --> 11:53.311
at hand.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.413
(Speaking inaudibly)

11:55.415 --> 11:56.748
Speaking of which...

11:56.750 --> 11:57.916
Excuse me.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.184
Excuse me!

11:59.186 --> 12:02.253
Guys, we could use
all hands on deck.
Right.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.189
And we are right here
with you, Walter.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.258
I just need everyone fixed
on-on the case.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.395
(Chuckles) And like I said,
we are right here with you.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.431
Okay? It's not like I can help
you hack a military computer.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.100
(Rapid beeping)

12:15.769 --> 12:18.002
Pace:
Good god.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.438
Woodrow's locked
on morales.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.443
Woodrow, you are locked in!
It's not me!

12:25.445 --> 12:27.779
My fire control
is completely disabled!

12:27.781 --> 12:31.783
Al, you're right
in the crosshairs.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.451
Oh, god.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.787
They can't eject. We got
to disarm those weapons now.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.355
What do you think
we're trying to do?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.424
They're heading
towards the ocean!

12:39.426 --> 12:42.060
(Whooshing)

12:53.373 --> 12:55.206
(Beeping)

12:59.379 --> 13:02.313
(Trilling)
Guys, the comm link
just went live.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.816
Why would they turn her comms
back on now?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.886
This is Blackjack 1,
lieutenant commander woodrow.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.054
Does anyone copy?!
Blackjack 1,

13:10.056 --> 13:12.390
this is admiral pace. I'm here
with homeland agent cabe gallo

13:12.392 --> 13:15.527
and an independent team. We're
trying to get you landed safely.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.395
I have no control
of my aircraft.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.397
I'm currently
in an auto-loop pattern.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.334
I just shot down my wingman,
lieutenant morales,

13:23.336 --> 13:24.469
over the pacific.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.804
No, no. Lieutenant commander...

13:25.806 --> 13:27.572
What's her first name, cabe?
June.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.575
June, this is Dr. Curtis
with scorpion,

13:30.577 --> 13:32.977
the team the admiral just
mentioned. Listen carefully,

13:32.979 --> 13:35.079
you didn't shoot down
your friend.
Yeah,

13:35.081 --> 13:36.481
hackers who took over your plane
fired that weapon.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.082
You're responsible for nothing.
(Phone rings)

13:38.084 --> 13:40.251
I need to take
this. Woodrow,

13:40.253 --> 13:42.420
fill in agent gallo.
Give him a full debriefing.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.489
First, my airspeed
increased independently.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.491
Then altitude.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.492
I lost all flight controls
and communications.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.829
One system failure
after another.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.832
That's why the hackers
turned on her comms.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.501
They wanted us to hear,
blow by blow,

13:56.503 --> 13:58.503
how an f-130
was systematically usurped.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.505
They
wanted June

14:00.507 --> 14:03.041
to debrief us so we could hear
how good they are at their jobs.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.477
It's-it's an advertisement,
a psychological tool.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.581
They are smart.
This is just the beginning.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.616
I just got off
the phone with D.C.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.019
Four U.S. destroyers
have been cyberjacked

14:15.021 --> 14:17.455
and positioned 300 yards outside
of Miami, Boston,

14:17.457 --> 14:18.590
Portland, and long beach.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.491
High-explosive
bgm missiles

14:20.493 --> 14:22.427
are pointed directly
at each of those cities.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.495
All of our aircraft, our
battleships have been grounded,

14:24.497 --> 14:26.564
and we've shut down
our nuclear silos.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.499
The United States,

14:28.501 --> 14:31.302
as of right now,
is a nation without defense.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.391
USS<i> hawthorne,</i> USS<i> crittinden,</i>
<i> corbett,</i> and<i> Rooney,</i>

14:53.393 --> 14:55.360
all under hacker control.
Happy:
Are you evacuating

14:55.362 --> 14:58.096
the cities?
We do that,
the story gets out

14:58.098 --> 14:59.931
we've lost control
of our military.
Cabe: I can think

14:59.933 --> 15:01.266
of a few nations
that would act immediately

15:01.268 --> 15:03.401
if they knew
we were defenseless.
Okay,

15:03.403 --> 15:06.104
can't you manually disengage
the missiles on the destroyers?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.273
Most ships' magazines
have automated blast doors.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.641
Assume they've been closed
by the hackers

15:09.643 --> 15:11.476
and the crew's been locked out
from the missiles.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.678
Exactly what happened.
And you know that
for certain?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
You've been in
contact with the ship?
Yes. Their comms are working.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.348
If he can talk
to the ships

15:17.350 --> 15:19.417
and we can talk to June, can
the hackers hear us right now

15:19.419 --> 15:21.552
and any plans...
(Quietly): We might devise?

15:24.224 --> 15:26.457
You know, I'm not too worried
about these hackers!

15:26.459 --> 15:28.593
Took 'em an hour of joystickin'
around to bring down a plane.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.328
If they had real skills,
they'd have June

15:30.330 --> 15:32.230
doing scissors and rolls
right now.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.365
Someone shut that guy up!

15:34.367 --> 15:35.400
What are you thinking?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.438
Okay, see? The punks that are
behind this don't speak English.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.607
If they did, they'd have
sent June into a tailspin,

15:42.609 --> 15:45.476
'cause I just called 'em out,
and they are egomaniacal,

15:45.478 --> 15:47.445
highly intelligent,
and antisocial.
So are we.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.515
But they are businessmen.
They positioned ships

15:50.517 --> 15:54.052
at the four corners
of the country. Why?

15:54.054 --> 15:56.220
Symbolic. "We got you boxed in."

15:56.222 --> 15:59.057
They are trying to prove
themselves to potential clients

15:59.059 --> 16:00.959
who want to bring the U.S.
to its knees.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.493
These guys
are bright,

16:02.495 --> 16:05.530
18 to 25-- because young people
are driven to prove themselves--

16:05.532 --> 16:07.632
and-- if I had
to guess--

16:07.634 --> 16:09.534
eastern European, because

16:09.536 --> 16:11.703
instead of focusing
on our monetary system

16:11.705 --> 16:14.372
or electrical grid,
they went after our military.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.241
These are children
of cold war parents

16:17.243 --> 16:19.510
who grew up hearing about
the mighty U.S. war machine.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.712
And I bet

16:20.714 --> 16:22.981
they smoke
those skinny euro cigarettes.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.383
That's how you profile.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.151
Walter:
Okay,

16:27.153 --> 16:29.153
let's assume Toby's right.
I am!

16:29.155 --> 16:31.022
So, sly, focus
on eastern Europe,

16:31.024 --> 16:33.191
see if we can track
the signal

16:33.193 --> 16:34.843
that's hacking June's plane.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.494
If we find the hackers,
we end all of this.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.197
All right, Ralph, do you think
you can run a rehash check,

16:39.199 --> 16:41.733
see if they're pulling this
off with a ddos attack?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.268
Sure. But can I get
some fruity moons or something?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.771
You find the European hackers,
I'll get you fruity moons.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.206
Unbelievable.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.507
Lieutenant commander,
can you stay with us

16:49.509 --> 16:50.508
while we sort this out?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.276
Don't have much of a choice.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.145
Happy and I will jump
on the dark web,

16:54.147 --> 16:56.514
see if anyone's bragging about
what they did to uncle Sam!

16:56.516 --> 16:57.515
Sylvester:
No need.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.584
I just traced the hack
to a section

16:59.586 --> 17:01.486
of Sofia, Bulgaria.
Toby:
Eastern Europe.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.588
Wow,
who could've predicted that?
Looks like they jumped

17:03.590 --> 17:05.323
onto a signal
from a Pentagon white shoe out

17:05.325 --> 17:06.758
of long beach.
What's a white shoe?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.761
Pentagon keeps nondescript
buildings in most U.S. cities.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.130
They're there
to maintain relay signals

17:12.132 --> 17:13.531
for military operations.
Walter:
That's how

17:13.533 --> 17:16.518
they're controlling the ships.
They're infiltrating

17:16.519 --> 17:19.504
white shoe signals in Boston,
Miami, Portland, and here.
Toby: They're using

17:19.506 --> 17:21.272
our own signals
to control our ships?

17:21.274 --> 17:23.274
Like when a bully
makes you hit yourself.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.377
So if we can get to the white
shoe office in long beach,

17:26.379 --> 17:28.713
then I can... I can hack
their server,

17:28.715 --> 17:31.716
see if I can figure out a way
to disrupt the hacker's signal.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.519
Then I tell the authorities
in the other three cities

17:34.521 --> 17:36.788
how to do it, and then we kill
the signal simultaneously

17:36.790 --> 17:39.290
and regain control of the ships.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.526
Now, Toby, I left
my car in Tahoe

17:41.528 --> 17:43.161
and Paige's is at her house,

17:43.163 --> 17:45.447
so we'll need
to borrow yours.
Okay,

17:45.448 --> 17:47.732
but I just had it washed in '08,
so be careful with it.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.234
Really?
So...

17:50.236 --> 17:52.804
You and Paige?
Why not Sylvester and Paige?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.472
No, sly will be with you
and cabe

17:54.474 --> 17:56.374
on the way to Bulgaria
to find the hackers.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.143
Oh, so you stay with Paige
and you ship me off to Bulgaria?

17:59.145 --> 17:59.644
Tim...

17:59.646 --> 18:00.778
Easy, buddy.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.346
Sly can handle whatever
the hackers

18:02.348 --> 18:03.815
throw at him tech-wise,
and you two

18:03.817 --> 18:05.817
are necessary law enforcement
in a foreign country.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.319
It's a logical way
to divide workload.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.620
Oh, yeah.
It's a load, all right.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.255
Well, if you don't agree
with my decision making,

18:11.257 --> 18:13.491
perhaps you should change
your homeland assignment.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.625
Tim: And perhaps
you should just tell us

18:14.627 --> 18:16.327
what you were doing in Tahoe,
Walter.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.196
Okay, this is not
the schoolyard.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.797
We got some serious work to do.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.265
Got it?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.101
Got it.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.435
Got it.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.671
Tim, Walter's the boss.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.339
We follow his lead.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.740
Yes, sir.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.445
Truth is, as much
as I hate flying, I am excited

18:34.447 --> 18:36.447
to get out of this garage.
Between Tim and Walter

18:36.449 --> 18:39.517
and happy and Toby,
it's too tense.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.588
I'm getting out of my jimjams.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.756
Admiral.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.658
All aircraft are grounded.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.328
How are you gonna find a plane
that can go at least mach 4

18:50.330 --> 18:52.196
and get you to Bulgaria
in two hours?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.531
Don't worry, I got an idea.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.299
Toby:
Um, speaking of planes,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.835
if the hackers pick up that
we're messing with their signal,

18:57.837 --> 19:00.271
they will drive June's plane
into the ground.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.373
Or, if this takes too long,

19:02.375 --> 19:04.909
there's always the chance
she runs out of gas and crashes.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.761
That's exactly what we want.

19:06.762 --> 19:08.612
It's not what<i> I</i> want!
No, no. Hear me out.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.283
If June does a fuel dump, the
plane will plummet instantly,

19:12.285 --> 19:15.453
because swept-wing aircraft have
the glide capacity of a rock.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.222
Sly can calculate it
so it nose-dives for our garage.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.690
And with the engine off,
the hackers

19:19.692 --> 19:21.359
won't be able
to control the plane.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.361
Then we just get the plane's
original, unhacked firmware

19:23.363 --> 19:24.862
back onto
the jet's computer.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.164
And I can do it with this.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.698
With a stud finder?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.800
You know, I can't go near stud
finders. They always go off.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.369
You've told that joke
before, okay? Happy.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.471
Data can be sent
over the lasers.

19:33.473 --> 19:37.175
I can send new firmware directly
into the jet's comm system.
Walter: It has

19:37.177 --> 19:39.477
an independent battery.
Even with the engine off,
it can accept the data.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.811
Happy:
And it's housed in
the nose of the plane

19:40.813 --> 19:43.347
that will point towards us
as it falls to earth.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.717
By "us," am I safe to assume
you're gonna put me in the path

19:46.719 --> 19:48.169
of a plummeting
f-130?

19:48.170 --> 19:49.620
I will build the laser
from the stud finder,

19:49.622 --> 19:51.722
some laser levels,
and sly's laser tag guns.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.424
You will prep the firmware.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.560
Walter:
Okay, June,
you'll have to be

19:55.562 --> 19:58.896
no more than 500 feet
from the rooftop to guarantee

19:58.898 --> 20:02.433
that the download works.
So I'll have seconds to restart
my engine solely on fumes,

20:02.435 --> 20:05.336
pull out of a nosedive,
and skim over rooftops

20:05.338 --> 20:07.272
to a safe landing somewhere?

20:07.273 --> 20:09.207
Aha. The safest bet
is the L.A. riverbed,

20:09.209 --> 20:10.741
four miles east of here.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.411
Million-to-one shot
but it could work.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.680
(Whooshing)

20:15.682 --> 20:17.648
Almost ready.
Happy, laser update?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.550
Don't worry about me.
Do your job.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.285
God forbid something goes wrong,
we get crushed.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.620
I'm really concerned
for your widower.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.821
Think he'll handle it well?

20:23.823 --> 20:24.922
Okay, that's it.
We're done talking.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.525
♪ I was walking ♪

20:27.527 --> 20:31.662
♪ down the street one day ♪

20:31.664 --> 20:35.299
♪ feeling lost and all alone ♪

20:35.301 --> 20:36.467
Happy:
Paige, how goes it with you?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.703
Uh, to be honest,
it's kind of awkward.

20:38.705 --> 20:42.440
She meant: How close
are we to the Pentagon office?

20:42.442 --> 20:44.542
Oh.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.310
Yeah, we're not
that far out at all.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.312
Sly, are the calculations
ready for June?

20:48.314 --> 20:50.014
Getting the final specs now.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.516
June, I need to know
the entire weight of your plane,

20:52.518 --> 20:54.252
including you
and your flight suit,

20:54.254 --> 20:57.321
the wingspan of your plane,
and your current velocity.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.656
Oh, hey.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.724
You Bruce?

20:59.726 --> 21:00.937
Yes, sir.

21:00.938 --> 21:02.149
We talked on the phone.

21:02.150 --> 21:03.361
I have to remind you
that all you were told

21:03.363 --> 21:04.495
is highly confidential.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.464
You repeat any of it,
it's a felony.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.898
I'm a Vietnam vet
and a patriot.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.433
My lips are sealed.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.501
And I got this baby

21:10.503 --> 21:12.637
fueled and prepped.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.172
It'll hit mach 4,

21:14.173 --> 21:15.706
have you in Bulgaria
faster than you could

21:15.708 --> 21:17.308
get home in L.A. traffic.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.809
And it's not
computerized at all?

21:18.811 --> 21:19.977
Nothing to hack.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.612
And you secured
us a pilot?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.847
You're looking at him.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.819
I know what you're thinking,

21:28.821 --> 21:30.788
but I was a good pilot
back in my day.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.856
How many missions?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.724
None.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.926
Right after my training

21:35.928 --> 21:37.395
we had a fire in my barracks.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.730
I burned my hands bad,
so they grounded me.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.699
I helped others
get ready to fight,

21:41.701 --> 21:43.934
but I never got to do
my part myself.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.404
So, please,

21:46.406 --> 21:47.772
let me serve my country.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.941
Okay, okay, June is ready.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.077
Is this guy gonna take us
to meet our pilot?

21:57.583 --> 21:58.749
Oh, poop.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.685
I've got the main
power cable

22:00.687 --> 22:02.620
and two back-ups
in case of failure.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.854
Okay, I'm almost done.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.324
Hook them up.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.458
Lenny.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.559
Huh?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.061
Jerry.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.862
What are you doing?
What?
Nothing.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.098
Norman, Jared, vern.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.101
You're calling out men I know
to see if I show guilt markers?

22:17.103 --> 22:19.103
Maybe.
Vern's my deli guy.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.706
Yeah, I've seen how
he handles your provolone.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.640
You're an idiot.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.775
No, I'm just hurt and angry.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.043
Do you have
any idea how

22:26.045 --> 22:27.762
what I'm going through feels?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.480
It feels like you just
took my heart and tore it

22:29.482 --> 22:31.749
from my body and then
just shoved it right up my...

22:31.751 --> 22:33.117
(Plane engine roaring)

22:41.728 --> 22:43.494
...and then it just lies there,
covered in flies.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.779
Even the dog doesn't want it,

22:44.780 --> 22:46.063
even though he ate it
in the first place.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.598
That's what's left of my heart!

22:47.600 --> 22:49.150
Hate to interrupt the fighting,

22:49.151 --> 22:50.701
but I need to make sure
your heads are in the game

22:50.703 --> 22:51.736
before I dump my fuel.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.903
We're fine.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.505
Toby's shutting up now.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.023
Good...

22:56.024 --> 22:57.540
Because if the hackers
keep up this same loop pattern,

22:57.543 --> 22:58.909
I'll be over you
again in minutes,

22:58.911 --> 23:00.678
and once my tanks are on empty,

23:00.680 --> 23:03.147
I'll be heading into
a complete vertical nosedive.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.049
Yup, straight down right
at us at terminal velocity.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.118
Oh, for Pete's sake,
don't say terminal.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.827
So...
So, I...

23:16.829 --> 23:17.828
Okay, go first.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.563
I'll go f... yeah.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.799
Can you, um...?
Hmm?

23:21.801 --> 23:24.502
Oh, yeah.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.637
So, I'm gonna take you
at your word that

23:26.639 --> 23:27.972
you were in Tahoe
for the festival,

23:27.974 --> 23:29.073
but Tim...

23:29.075 --> 23:30.808
Tim does not take me at my word.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.811
That's his prerogative,
but I told the truth.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.979
Be that as it may,
you heard the admiral.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.981
The U.S. is being forced
into civil war,

23:36.983 --> 23:39.049
our weapons being forced
against ourselves...

23:39.051 --> 23:41.719
And we don't need scorpion
turning against itself, as well,

23:41.721 --> 23:45.656
but with me and Tim
and Toby and happy, we are,

23:45.658 --> 23:47.658
and that's not ideal
when the stakes are high.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.793
I... understood.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.796
So, for now,
just steer clear of Tim.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.831

23:53.833 --> 23:55.800
♪ On you ♪

23:55.802 --> 23:59.870

24:04.210 --> 24:05.977
It is kind of

confusing that you'd give away
tickets to a jazz festival

24:07.747 --> 24:08.879
and show up, anyway.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.948
(Plane engine roars)

24:10.950 --> 24:13.651
Uh... we should put
our comms back in.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.487

24:16.489 --> 24:18.222
Two kilometers

We're positioned.
Bring her in nice and steady.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.127
Woodrow:
How about extremely fast
and out of control?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.496
Forgive me, getting a little

24:25.498 --> 24:26.697
beaded up about this plan.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.532
Beaded up: Sweaty, worried.

24:28.534 --> 24:29.934
I know my pilot terms.

24:29.936 --> 24:30.935
Lieutenant,

24:30.937 --> 24:32.803
that fancy plane you're flying,

24:32.805 --> 24:33.971
all the minds
who designed it,

24:33.973 --> 24:35.606
compared to us
they're morons,

24:35.608 --> 24:36.774
so no need to sweat it.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.176
(Quietly):
She should be terrified.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.913
Okay, you should be in
position in two, one...

24:42.915 --> 24:44.682
Ring the admiral's
doorbell.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.783
That means dump the fuel.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.618
That one I didn't know.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.954
Here goes.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.592
Engine's shutting down.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.896
Oh, man, here she comes.

25:00.867 --> 25:01.866
Right for our butts.

25:01.868 --> 25:02.867
Firing the laser.

25:02.869 --> 25:03.801
Uh, two degrees north.

25:05.238 --> 25:07.271
How we doing down there?

25:07.273 --> 25:08.772
The laser's locked on your nose.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.241
Uploading the firmware.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.709
Woodrow:
<i> Estimating I'm three</i>
<i> nautical miles</i>

25:11.711 --> 25:13.711
from your roof.
You might want to bail.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.579
We bail, the laser could shift
and you'd die.

25:15.581 --> 25:16.714
We're staying.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.399
If these are
our last moments together,

25:18.400 --> 25:20.083
I propose we die
with no secrets between us.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.986
No.
I'll go first.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.988
Sometimes when I'm alone in the
garage I sniff your work gloves.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.256
Great, now I can die disgusted.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.790
Guys?
Another time?

25:26.792 --> 25:28.626
The mix of lavender hand cream
and motor oil

25:28.628 --> 25:29.994
reminds me of your
emotional dichotomy.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.896
Woodrow:
Ten seconds to the envelope.

25:31.898 --> 25:32.863
Past that I can't pull out.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.835
That jet's getting awfully big.

25:37.837 --> 25:38.736
Eight seconds.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.870
Okay, now your turn.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.871
Who is your husband?!

25:40.873 --> 25:43.207
(Computer beeping)

25:43.209 --> 25:44.975
Punch it, June!

25:46.279 --> 25:47.611
Hit the deck!

25:47.613 --> 25:48.812
(Screams)

25:52.818 --> 25:53.951
Made it.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.220
L.A. riverbed is my bingo.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.955
Fuel's at zero.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.990
I'm setting down.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.660
Thank you... to you
and your whole team.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.862
Hey, you okay?

26:04.864 --> 26:06.297
Yeah.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.067
You gonna answer
that question or what?

26:13.205 --> 26:16.206
I've given to you my heart

26:16.208 --> 26:18.576
and my soul, more than
I've ever given to anyone.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.911
Now, in your head
that may not add up to 100%.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.446
Tough.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.980
The one percent is the price
of admission to happyland.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.049
You have to pay.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.085
I am not an open book.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.020
Get used to it!

26:30.022 --> 26:31.789
I'm not in happyland!
I'm in angryworld.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.757
Next stop resentment town.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.027
That's your team
we're listening to?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.762
Ah, not if I can help it.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.998
I'm gonna take this comm out
until we land.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.034
You know...

26:44.036 --> 26:45.636
You've played my hand.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.104
Now I have no choice
but erasure.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.139
And I don't mean
the delightful synthpop duo.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.841
What is this?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.009
Oh, I'm literally
and figuratively

26:52.011 --> 26:53.177
sweeping away
the proposal.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.012
It's hereby rescinded.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.097
Like hell it is.

26:56.098 --> 26:57.181
What do you care?
You're married.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.083
I am going to fix it.

26:59.085 --> 27:02.019
My proposal was a contractual
offer: All of me for all of you.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.888
You can't meet my terms,
so, offer off the table.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.024
Pardon me.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.062
Cabe:
<i> Okay, NATO's granted us</i>

27:12.064 --> 27:13.163
permission to land

27:13.165 --> 27:15.799
under the cover
that we're U.S. military

27:15.801 --> 27:17.735
delivering the valkyrie
for Bulgarian training.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.103
We've been
combing through

27:19.105 --> 27:20.771
the eastern European
dark web and the name

27:20.773 --> 27:22.906
that keeps coming up
regarding criminal matters

27:22.908 --> 27:24.375
in Sofia is one

27:24.377 --> 27:25.743
Dimitri borosevich,

27:25.745 --> 27:27.745
aka "na skunks."

27:27.747 --> 27:28.912
What does that mean?

27:28.914 --> 27:29.813
The skunk.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.315
He appears to be

27:31.317 --> 27:33.217
the underground kingpin
of the city.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.952
Yeah, international warrants
for wire fraud,

27:34.954 --> 27:37.471
identity theft,
gambling rings...

27:37.472 --> 27:39.989
Well, Sofia isn't a big town,
so if he's not behind the hacks,

27:39.992 --> 27:42.993
he'll be getting kickbacks
from the people who are.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.663
Find the skunk,
find the hackers.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.064
Putting together cultural
protocols for Bulgaria.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.198
There's a few things you'll need

27:48.200 --> 27:49.967
on the ground.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.736
This isn't an engineering or
mechanical issue, so<i> pardonne.</i>

27:55.975 --> 27:57.675
Gentlemen,
when we touch down

27:57.677 --> 27:59.309
I recommend expediency.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.079
Won't take the Bulgarian
military long to see through

28:02.081 --> 28:03.247
that training jet story.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.414
Toby:
All right, I'll just give you

28:04.417 --> 28:05.416
Bulgarian essentials.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.017
No is yes, yes is no.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.018
Come again?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.003
It's unique to the country.

28:09.004 --> 28:09.987
For "yes,"
they shake their head.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.388
For "no," they nod up and down.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.791
No way that could
cause confusion.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.893
I agree completely.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.127
That felt way too odd.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.232
(Tires screeching)

28:31.977 --> 28:33.077
No one's around.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.978
Government building
on a Saturday.

28:34.980 --> 28:35.979
It's abandoned.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.082
You can get us in here?

28:38.084 --> 28:40.284
Well, you can't be friends
with happy Quinn for seven years

28:40.286 --> 28:42.986
without learning stuff.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.055
(Exhales)
Okay.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.425
Walter:
Okay, I'm into the Pentagon
server. Three minutes

28:48.427 --> 28:50.728
and we'll shut down the signal
controlling the<i> corbett.</i>

28:50.730 --> 28:52.496
Boy, that thing looks mean.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.138
Cabe:<i> If things get hot,</i>
<i> don't be a hero.</i>

29:01.140 --> 29:02.484
You're a civilian.

29:02.485 --> 29:03.829
You get on that plane
and go home.

29:03.830 --> 29:05.174
I am not gonna abandon you guys.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.277
Good luck.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.445
Toby:
Hey, found more

29:08.447 --> 29:10.147
on El skunko.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.115
Latest arrests:

29:11.117 --> 29:12.816
Four in the last two months,

29:12.818 --> 29:13.917
all for gambling.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.186
All out of one building
in a slum

29:16.188 --> 29:18.055
in the nadezhda area of Sofia.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.289
I'll send the address.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.891
So, what are we supposed
to do when we get there?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.860
Just politely ask
to meet the skunk?

29:22.862 --> 29:23.994
(Laughs)

29:23.996 --> 29:25.129
That's like walking
into little Italy

29:25.131 --> 29:26.830
and asking to see don corleone.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.465
You got to make him want
to talk to you.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.933
We got to get in his game,

29:29.935 --> 29:32.035
take enough of his money
to get his attention.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.203
Doesn't seem
like the type of guy

29:33.205 --> 29:34.772
who'd take too favorably
to that.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.039
Well, looks like
you'll find out, sly.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.207
I am?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.642
Why me?

29:38.643 --> 29:40.076
I mean, do you
really want me and cabe

29:40.079 --> 29:41.178
running odds
on dealt hands?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.313
No, you're the man
for the job.

29:43.315 --> 29:47.084
I had the consulate get us ten
grand for a gambling stake.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.219
Cabe, is that the car
you got for us?

29:49.221 --> 29:51.822
Yeah, I told the embassy we
needed something so we'd fit in.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.094
We're not gonna fit in that!

29:57.096 --> 29:59.229
Just downloading the last
of the software and then...

29:59.231 --> 30:01.331
Done.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.200
Should be done
in a minute or so.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.102
Uh, Toby, Walt's almost ready.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.170
How are sly and...

30:06.172 --> 30:07.938
Comms don't
work in here.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.174
The walls are aluminum,
forming a Faraday cage.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.142
The windows are protected by,

30:12.144 --> 30:14.244
uh, scrambling data technology.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.313
The Pentagon does not
like bugging.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.082
(Takes deep breath)

30:19.084 --> 30:21.318
Beautiful view.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.123
Yeah.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.959
Um...

30:28.961 --> 30:30.828
So there might have
been another reason

30:30.830 --> 30:33.230
why I drove to Tahoe,

30:33.232 --> 30:34.264
beyond my interest in jazz.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.133
Oh... okay.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.685
I believe that
this team functions best

30:37.686 --> 30:39.236
under the policy of openness
and-and honesty,

30:39.238 --> 30:41.572
and I wasn't honest earlier,
so, Paige...

30:41.574 --> 30:44.107
Uh, for a long time I've wanted

30:44.109 --> 30:45.542
to tell you
something and...
Walter.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.144
Oh, my god.
I know.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.178
It's a big deal, so it's time

30:48.180 --> 30:49.513
that i-i finally say it.
No, no.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.448
Walter, look,
it's coming right at us.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.620
Oh, boy, that's a missile.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.627
Flight speed of their
ballistic missile,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.095
800 kilometers an hour,

31:05.097 --> 31:06.396
or 497...
How long do we have, Walter?

31:06.398 --> 31:07.464
50 seconds.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.368
No, no, it took
over a minute

31:11.370 --> 31:13.103
to get up here by elevator.
Stairs are too slow.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.104
What do we do then?!

31:14.105 --> 31:15.104
Here, I have an idea.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.007
Hold sly's cuckoo Clay.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.945
Okay, how did the hackers know

31:21.947 --> 31:23.213
we were trying
to interrupt the signal?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.481
Must've been monitoring
connection traffic

31:24.483 --> 31:25.983
from that server room.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.885
Either way, Walt and Paige
have 38 seconds

31:27.887 --> 31:29.987
until kablooie!
Not good.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.557
(Both grunting)
Yeah, thanks.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.630
(Clangs)
Oh, boy.

31:39.632 --> 31:42.032
Okay, now,
cover your hands

31:42.034 --> 31:44.234
in sly's cuckoo Clay.
It will protect our hands

31:44.236 --> 31:46.136
but also has
a low coefficient of friction

31:46.138 --> 31:47.304
so we'll slide
down fast.

31:47.306 --> 31:50.040
Descent should only take
a few seconds.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.009
Fewer if we fall.
Happy:
Okay, how long

31:52.011 --> 31:53.610
until the missile hits?
20 seconds.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.482
We got to go faster!
I'm going as fast as I can!

31:59.919 --> 32:01.652
What do you mean there's
a missile headed for them?

32:01.654 --> 32:04.021
How is "missile heading
for them" confusing?

32:04.023 --> 32:05.589
We're getting
closer.

32:09.662 --> 32:10.594
I can't believe
this is happening.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.097
Walter:
Get down!

32:17.036 --> 32:18.402
(Paige gasps)

32:21.106 --> 32:23.707
(Exhales) That was close.
I think we're okay.

32:23.709 --> 32:24.708
(Creaking)

32:24.710 --> 32:26.443
The cable's gonna snap!
What?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.245
Get us out of here!

32:28.247 --> 32:30.347
Okay.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.683
(Grunting)

32:33.986 --> 32:36.586
Open! Open!
(Grunts)

32:36.588 --> 32:37.955
All right, hurry, hurry.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.957
Hurry, okay.
Okay.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.658
All right, get out.
Walter.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.694
(Grunting)
Walter.

32:43.696 --> 32:44.561
Walter.

32:45.731 --> 32:46.730
(Gasps)

32:46.732 --> 32:48.532
(Both coughing)

32:48.534 --> 32:50.000
You okay?
Yeah.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.502
Yeah. Hurry. We got
to get out of here.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.272
(Sirens wailing in distance)

32:55.274 --> 32:58.008
Happy? Toby? Why
don't we have comms?

32:58.010 --> 33:00.210
We're outside.
The heat from the missile
ionized the air,

33:00.212 --> 33:02.346
and it's disrupted the signal.
We need to get back

33:02.348 --> 33:04.581
to the garage.
Whoa. We have a
transportation problem.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.685
Toby's having
a bad 24 hours.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.087
(Phone rings)

33:10.089 --> 33:11.655
Uh, hey.
Tim:
Paige,

33:11.656 --> 33:13.222
are you okay?
It's been radio silence!
Walter: Yes, Tim,

33:13.225 --> 33:14.641
we're both fine, thank you

33:14.642 --> 33:16.058
for a...
You promised.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.463
But the Pentagon is going
to need a new relay server.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.732
And a new building to put it in.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.067
Guys, the destroyers
are still under hacker control.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.403
Their signal wasn't even
interrupted for a second.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.405
They spoofed a signal
to the white shoe office

33:28.407 --> 33:31.141
to sniff out anyone
who could be posing a threat.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.543
They're not really using
the Pentagon relay system.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.545
They must be using a satellite.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.547
Yes. Sending code directly

33:37.549 --> 33:40.083
to the ship's operating system.
Tim:
And the U.S. can't shoot down

33:40.085 --> 33:42.386
any satellites because
we disabled all our missiles

33:42.388 --> 33:44.087
this morning.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.072
Can you hack the satellite?

33:45.073 --> 33:46.056
I need to get back
to the garage.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.557
Uh, cabe, we're stranded.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.059
Homeland can
get you a car.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.727
Wait, why? Where's my car?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.396
Toby wants to know
where his car is.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.332
(Crowd screaming)

33:55.334 --> 33:57.234
Oh, my god.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.803
Kind of all over.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.238
What does that mean?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.106
We just texted you homeland's

34:03.108 --> 34:05.242
local office.
Okay, I'll-I'll call 'em.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.177
Okay.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.678
Cabe, those guys are smart.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.747
You need to find them soon.
We will.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.816
So long as sly
wins at baccarat.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.518
All right, kid,
we got to jump.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.520
We just got to where
we're supposed to be.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.268
This is
skunk's hq.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.070
Total dump

34:33.072 --> 34:35.272
with chauffeurs
and nice cars out front.
Translation:

34:35.274 --> 34:37.140
It's a casino.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.109
I think you guys
are significantly overestimating

34:39.111 --> 34:41.678
my gambling abilities.
Toby:
No, you can take that house

34:41.680 --> 34:44.247
blindfolded and deaf. Which you
will be, essentially, because

34:44.249 --> 34:45.682
I'm sure
they jammed communications

34:45.684 --> 34:46.683
to prevent cheating.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.585
Listen, sly, these guys,

34:48.587 --> 34:50.420
they're just animals.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.222
All you got to do is gain
their respect, okay?

34:52.224 --> 34:55.592
Be the Alpha. Control the game.
Own the room.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.794
He's right, sly.
Alpha.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.230
Someone tries to take something
from you, you take it back.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.865
Don't ever let someone
take something from you

35:01.867 --> 35:03.133
that's important.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.270
Think timbo's talking
about the waitress.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.438
Cabe:
Remember, the fate
of the free world

35:08.440 --> 35:10.207
may be in your hands.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.242
You win every cent you can

35:12.244 --> 35:14.144
as fast as you can
to draw skunk out.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.379
Okay, i-i guess.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.248
But, uh...

35:18.250 --> 35:21.551
What exactly are the rules
of baccarat?

35:22.554 --> 35:24.254
Oh, good,
you're here. Yeah,

35:24.256 --> 35:26.223
I want to use my phone to begin
a trace of satellites

35:26.225 --> 35:28.225
in geosynchronous orbit
over Los Angeles.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.560
What? Did you get homeland
to send a car?

35:30.562 --> 35:33.430
I did. I also accidentally
saw one of your texts.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.765
"Hello, Mr. Armstrong.
This is the concierge

35:35.767 --> 35:38.101

35:40.439 --> 35:43.406
from adjoining rooms
to separate singles."

35:45.177 --> 35:46.409
You changed the reservation?

35:46.411 --> 35:48.145
There's, uh, an explanation.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.296
Did you also call
the dining room,

35:49.297 --> 35:50.446
pretending to be
the board of health?

35:52.818 --> 35:55.886

on a single hand.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.660
I'm gonna stay on the natural.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.766
Go ahead. That's a five.
You can draw.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.507
That's a bust! Ooh!

37:58.777 --> 38:00.377
This is fun.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.881
They're gonna get very pissed
very quickly.

38:04.883 --> 38:05.949
Perfect.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.617
Paige, uh, maybe
we should stay

38:07.619 --> 38:09.753
in one place so that the-the
homeland car can find us.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.688
I'm walking
to the freeway off-ramp.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.622
They can find me there.
Uh, maybe that
is more efficient.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.625
It is not about efficient,
Walter! It is about

38:15.627 --> 38:17.460
getting away from you!
You're-you're
upset.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.329
Wow! You are
a genius.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.664
I'm gonna take this out
so the team can't hear

38:20.666 --> 38:21.865
what I'm about to say.
You can actually

38:21.867 --> 38:23.400
leave the comm in.
We're still within range

38:23.402 --> 38:24.713
of the missile ionization.

38:24.714 --> 38:26.025
I am taking this out
as an indicator

38:26.026 --> 38:27.337
of me doing whatever the hell
i want without some...

38:27.339 --> 38:29.406
Stupid genius
telling me what to do.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.807
Fair enough.
Why did you call

38:30.809 --> 38:31.741
the hotel?

38:31.743 --> 38:34.010
Uh, because, uh...

38:34.012 --> 38:36.413
Because you are a jealous infant
who can't find

38:36.415 --> 38:38.715
your own way to happiness,
so you choose to disrupt

38:38.717 --> 38:40.717
the happiness of everyone else.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.987
Well, not intentionally.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.989
I can't believe
you sabotaged me.

38:47.826 --> 38:51.361
I've been waiting two years
to tell you this, Walter.

38:51.363 --> 38:55.065
You... were... wrong.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.504
Oh!
(Laughs)

39:01.506 --> 39:04.341
That's what's called
hitting the tie.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.109
You know,
statistically,

39:06.111 --> 39:08.511
betting on the tie
is an idiotic move

39:08.513 --> 39:11.014
but not when you know
what you're do... ah...

39:11.016 --> 39:13.083
You are doing quite well.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.353
You and friends
would like to go vip?

39:16.355 --> 39:19.923
Uh, yeah, that sounds like fun.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.459
He did it.
We're gonna meet the skunk.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.461
Yep.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.363
(Phone rings)
Yeah.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.530
This is admiral pace.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.099
Get me gallo.
Toby:
Sorry, he's out

39:29.101 --> 39:31.634
of comm range watching Sylvester
play baccarat in an underground

39:31.636 --> 39:33.636
Bulgarian casino
with a criminal named skunk.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.804
What?
Happy:
How can we help,

39:34.806 --> 39:37.140
admiral?
Get word to gallo

39:37.141 --> 39:39.475
that all the nuclear subs have
returned to base except for one.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.044
<i> Ohio</i> class, the<i> Clayton.</i>

39:41.046 --> 39:43.480
It's gone missing off the coast
of Southern California.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.415
Are you saying the hackers
are controlling a sub

39:45.417 --> 39:46.416
with nukes on it?

39:46.418 --> 39:47.884
That's exactly what I'm saying.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.491
(Phone buzzing)

40:10.175 --> 40:12.509
I would like
to explain myself.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.779
I don't want to hear it.
There's no excuse.

40:15.781 --> 40:19.616
That's true.
But there is context.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.684
I don't care.

40:30.162 --> 40:33.897
I went to Tahoe
to tell you I love you.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.834
Tim:
Hey, Walter?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.169
We're out of the card room,

40:39.171 --> 40:42.005
and your comm's up
and running again.

40:42.007 --> 40:45.074
And when we get out of here,
we're gonna have a little talk.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.536
So, we're just
gonna stand here,

40:56.537 --> 40:58.120
or one of you guys
gonna ask us to dance?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.893
Oh, you must be skunk.

41:03.895 --> 41:04.994
It's a pleasure.

41:06.798 --> 41:10.633
Baccarat is practically
a coin flip, but you

41:10.635 --> 41:13.803
hit 15 hands
in a row.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.238
You cheat.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.173
No, once the shoe
is down to two decks,

41:17.175 --> 41:18.641
it's the simplest math.

41:18.643 --> 41:19.742
He's a math genius.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.144
We're just trying to get
your attention.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.245
Cabe:
We wanted a meeting

41:22.247 --> 41:23.913
with the main man in Sofia.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.915
We knew that
wouldn't come cheap.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.984
Your reputation precedes
you all the way to the U.S.

41:32.557 --> 41:33.690
(Whispering):
Yes is no,

41:33.692 --> 41:35.692
no is yes.
Oh, I mean, um...

41:35.694 --> 41:36.860
You're really something.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.929
You got my attention.

41:39.931 --> 41:40.897
Who are you?

41:40.899 --> 41:42.999
We do financial
reappropriation

41:43.001 --> 41:44.000
in the cybersphere.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.970
Online bank thieves.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.973
Yeah, we farmed out a job
to a group in Sofia, hackers,

41:49.975 --> 41:51.074
gave them all the
intel on the bank,

41:51.076 --> 41:52.909
paid them their fee,
they stole the cash,

41:52.911 --> 41:53.910
never turned over a dime.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.512
Too bad for you.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.914
We figure anybody
working this area

41:57.916 --> 41:59.182
pays you regular tribute.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.084
So, for their address,
we'll give you

42:01.086 --> 42:02.285
the money we earned,

42:02.287 --> 42:05.889
our ten-grand buy-in
and a finder's fee

42:05.891 --> 42:07.957
if the intel nabs the punks.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.198
(Grunts)

42:16.868 --> 42:18.034
I'm okay.

42:32.584 --> 42:34.117
Which are missing?

42:34.119 --> 42:37.120
Ace of diamonds, two of spades,
king of clubs.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.328
Hmm.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.869
Only people who can pull off
what you say

42:52.871 --> 42:54.971
are called "the bootleggers."

42:54.973 --> 42:57.907
I give you information,

42:57.909 --> 42:59.776
you give me

42:59.778 --> 43:01.210
him.
Me?

43:01.212 --> 43:03.012
(Chuckles)
For just one game.

43:03.014 --> 43:06.916
There is Chinese whale, chingwe,
been wiping me out.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.785
He plays today.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.119
I want back my lev.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.322
I think you might need
to find another math genius

43:12.324 --> 43:13.957
to help you win back your lev.

43:13.959 --> 43:15.959
(Clears throat)
Okay?
I... um...

43:17.963 --> 43:19.028
(Under breath):
Excuse us.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.930
Okay.

43:22.367 --> 43:26.703
Kid, these bootleggers
have taken out a fighter jet,

43:26.705 --> 43:29.205
controlled four Navy destroyers,

43:29.207 --> 43:31.274
and now they have a sub
with nukes on it.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.176
We're talking the balance
of the free world here, sly.

43:33.178 --> 43:34.777
(Whispering):
So, pretend to scratch

43:34.779 --> 43:35.912
your ear and take
your comm out.

43:35.914 --> 43:36.913
Give it to me.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.081
It can't be
found on you.

43:38.083 --> 43:39.849
We'll be back
to get you after

43:39.851 --> 43:41.017
the threat is neutralized.

43:41.019 --> 43:42.118
You're serious?

43:42.120 --> 43:43.953
As a heart attack.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.622
Like the one I'm about to have?

43:46.391 --> 43:48.091
Okay, skunk.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.728
You got a deal.

43:57.369 --> 43:58.701
So, the hacked
sub is somewhere

43:58.703 --> 44:00.370
off the coast
of California,

44:00.371 --> 44:02.038
but whether it's going north
or south is anyone's guess,

44:02.040 --> 44:03.406
including
the sub captain.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.642
Okay, they're in communication
with admiral pace,

44:05.644 --> 44:08.344
but their sonar, depth finder
and radar have all gone dark.

44:08.346 --> 44:10.279
The fastest way to find
the sub would be to use

44:10.281 --> 44:12.281
the sonar capabilities
of the USS<i> corbett.</i>

44:12.283 --> 44:14.350
But the<i> corbett's</i> under control
of the hackers.

44:14.352 --> 44:17.220
Yeah, so we'll need
a top-down approach.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.656
You get it? Top-down?

44:19.657 --> 44:20.990
'Cause the<i> corbett's </i>
being controlled

44:20.992 --> 44:23.159
by a satellite that's
above them. It's top-down...

44:26.097 --> 44:27.430
I'm gonna clean up
some more confetti.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.365
Walter:
Top-down? That's brilliant.

44:29.367 --> 44:30.589
We can't destroy the satellite

44:30.590 --> 44:31.812
because the missiles
are grounded,

44:31.813 --> 44:33.035
but if we can disrupt
the satellite's signal

44:33.038 --> 44:34.270
before it gets to the ship,

44:34.272 --> 44:35.838
then we can regain control
of the destroyer.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.408
But even if we disrupt
the signal, you can't reprogram

44:38.410 --> 44:41.077
the<i> corbett's</i> computers without
physically being on the boat.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.845
You try to go out
to that destroyer, Walt,

44:42.847 --> 44:44.847
I guarantee you the hackers
will use the ship's weaponry

44:44.849 --> 44:45.982
to turn you into Swiss cheese.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.283
And it's moot, anyway,

44:47.285 --> 44:48.351
because we have
no way to disrupt

44:48.353 --> 44:50.353
the hackers' sat signal
to the ship.

44:50.355 --> 44:51.287
Yes, we do.

44:51.289 --> 44:52.455
Confetti.

44:52.457 --> 44:53.456
What about it?

44:53.458 --> 44:54.857
If we create a metallic shower,

44:54.859 --> 44:56.292
like confetti,
in the air above the ship...

44:56.294 --> 44:57.960
It will interfere
with the satellite signal

44:57.962 --> 44:59.195
long enough for us
to regain control

44:59.197 --> 45:00.296
of the destroyer's computers.

45:00.298 --> 45:02.065
Except the forecast only calls

45:02.067 --> 45:04.033
for a chance of silver

45:04.035 --> 45:05.268
with a light
drizzle of copper.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.136
How the hell are you
gonna make it rain aluminum?

45:07.138 --> 45:09.305
Easy. Happy just needs
to borrow her father's flatbed,

45:09.307 --> 45:10.807
get to the weapons
museum where cabe

45:10.809 --> 45:11.808
got the valkyrie from,

45:11.810 --> 45:13.276
and then commandeer a trebuchet.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.147
Paige and I are gonna visit
your friend in San Pedro, Toby,

45:18.149 --> 45:19.348
the one with the giant balls.

45:19.350 --> 45:20.349
Sor...

45:20.351 --> 45:21.718
I'm sorry, what?

45:21.720 --> 45:23.152
Drop your pants.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.287
Pardon me?

45:24.289 --> 45:25.822
You change.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.490
Look like us,

45:27.492 --> 45:30.059
or chingwe gets suspicious,
won't play you.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.862
I have an issue
with changing in public.

45:32.864 --> 45:35.364
Chingwe, he's good player, hmm?

45:35.366 --> 45:36.833
Clever.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.401
Smart cheater.

45:38.403 --> 45:40.336
You outcheat him.

45:40.338 --> 45:41.471
Uh... uh, no.

45:41.473 --> 45:43.072
I intend to play
with my intellect

45:43.074 --> 45:44.507
because cheaters get hurt.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.342
Don't worry
about his gunmen.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.944
We have our own.

45:47.946 --> 45:50.346
Shooting starts,
just hit the deck.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.848
(Lightly gasps)
Once you've
taken him

45:51.850 --> 45:53.516
for three million U.S.,

45:53.518 --> 45:55.418
we'll shut down the game.
You go home.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.953
Here.

45:57.922 --> 46:00.022
Final touch.

46:00.024 --> 46:01.190
It belonged to Oleg.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.365
What happened to Oleg?

46:09.367 --> 46:11.200
Turn left in 1.3 miles.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.103
You know, you haven't said

46:14.105 --> 46:16.005
a whole hell of a lot
since Walter

46:16.007 --> 46:18.441
said he loved Paige.

46:18.443 --> 46:20.176
I'm concentrating
on the mission.

46:20.178 --> 46:21.177
You're stewing.

46:21.179 --> 46:22.245
I'm not St...

46:22.247 --> 46:24.280
(Sighs)

46:24.282 --> 46:25.915
I feel like Walter
was dishonest.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.984
Well, this might
sound odd, but...

46:27.986 --> 46:31.287
Behaviorally, that might
be progress for Walter.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.289
Yeah, well, he and I still
need to have a little talk.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.291
Does that include him getting
slugged in the mouth?

46:35.293 --> 46:36.459
It's an option
currently being considered.

46:36.461 --> 46:37.527
Well, move off it.

46:37.529 --> 46:39.028
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

46:39.030 --> 46:41.364
Besides, if you even
get in a glancing blow,

46:41.366 --> 46:43.833
you'd probably pop his head off.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.468
These guys are smart;
They're not sturdy.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.403
Turn.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.444
You okay?

46:58.383 --> 47:00.316
Happy and Toby
are a minute out.

47:00.318 --> 47:03.486
I know.
I heard their call.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.421
It's very kind
of that gentleman

47:05.423 --> 47:07.490
with the aluminum balls
to let us rent his truck.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.325
You've said that three times.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.961
Just acknowledging
a human kindness.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.396
Walter, accept the fact
that by sabotaging

47:13.398 --> 47:15.898
my weekend with Tim
you acted horribly.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.333
Also accept the fact
that this topic

47:17.335 --> 47:19.569
won't be discussed
until I am ready to discuss it.

47:19.571 --> 47:21.404
Okay? You are not in control.

47:21.406 --> 47:23.539
Okay.

47:23.541 --> 47:25.241
It's good to know.

47:25.243 --> 47:27.210
(Horn honks)

47:27.212 --> 47:28.344
Oh, good. They're here.

47:39.490 --> 47:42.859
We brought the solution,
straight from 300 bc.

47:42.861 --> 47:45.528
Okay, let's get set up fast.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.364
I'll call admiral pace
and make sure

47:48.365 --> 47:50.232
he's downloaded our plan
to the three other cities.

47:50.235 --> 47:52.134
She doesn't know what
i muttered over the comms.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.336
What, about being in love
with her?

47:53.338 --> 47:54.971
She doesn't need
to know that.

47:54.973 --> 47:57.073
And, besides, what you
heard was out of context.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.341
Oh, put it in context.

47:58.342 --> 47:59.608
I'd prefer that we
forget it happened.

47:59.609 --> 48:00.875
Right, we'll pretend
you don't love Paige

48:00.879 --> 48:02.445
and I'll pretend happy
isn't married to some yahoo.

48:02.447 --> 48:04.080
What's amazing
is the sanest thing

48:04.082 --> 48:05.214
we'll do today is launch

48:05.216 --> 48:06.549
an enormous aluminum ball
at a battleship.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.219
I'm teaming
with her today.

48:11.356 --> 48:12.655
I will set up the trebuchet

48:12.657 --> 48:14.257
and dial in the trajectory.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.026
Okay, I'm heading to the Marina
to hotwire you a boat.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.628
Once the satellite signal
is blocked,

48:18.630 --> 48:20.329
you need to be on the destroyer.

48:20.331 --> 48:22.398
You'll only have two minutes
to reprogram the system.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.332
Actually, 90 seconds.

48:23.334 --> 48:24.600
Okay, authorities in Miami,

48:24.602 --> 48:26.202
Portland and Boston
have all collected

48:26.204 --> 48:28.237
their aluminum and are
creating their projectiles.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.072
After what happened with
the high-rise in long beach,

48:30.074 --> 48:32.074
admiral pace believes
that if this doesn't work,

48:32.076 --> 48:33.309
the hackers will launch
all remaining missiles

48:33.311 --> 48:34.377
onto U.S. soil.

48:35.914 --> 48:37.947
Walter, this is a real gamble.

48:45.556 --> 48:47.123
Remember,

48:47.125 --> 48:48.324
no talking.

48:48.326 --> 48:50.059
Your accent
gives you away.

48:50.061 --> 48:52.561
He's got to think
you're one of us.

49:06.010 --> 49:08.711
Happy, I spoke with the
captain of the<i> corbett.</i>

49:08.713 --> 49:10.413
They're expecting me.

49:10.414 --> 49:12.114
Happy: Are you expecting
what the hackers will do

49:12.116 --> 49:14.383
when you get close?
They'll open fire

49:14.385 --> 49:15.701
with the forward guns?

49:15.702 --> 49:17.018
This is not bulletproof,
and neither are you.

49:17.021 --> 49:19.388
Yeah, well, I have a plan.

49:19.390 --> 49:20.489
Dodging bullets

49:20.491 --> 49:22.959
in a boat is not a plan!

49:25.129 --> 49:26.329
Ready?
Toby: This has a shot

49:26.331 --> 49:28.197
if Walter can make it
out to that ship.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.298
No gunfire yet.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.466
Maybe the hackers
aren't looking

49:30.468 --> 49:31.534
through the ship's
security cameras.

49:34.339 --> 49:36.272
(Rapid gunfire continues)

49:36.674 --> 49:37.974
You were saying?

49:37.976 --> 49:40.076
Toby, prepare to fire
the trebuchet.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.510
I don't have much time here!

49:41.512 --> 49:44.246
Okay, all the other cities
are ready for the order.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.715
Three seconds,
I'm through this rope,

49:45.717 --> 49:47.049
then it's great balls of fire.

49:47.051 --> 49:49.485
Three, two... one.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.287
Fire!

49:57.362 --> 50:00.563
(Gunfire)
Happy, progress report!

50:00.565 --> 50:03.232
We need phosphoric acid
and aluminum to eat the rust.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.735
Anybody got a soda? A cola?

50:05.737 --> 50:08.304
Oh, I have a Dr. shazz
in my bag.

50:08.306 --> 50:10.740
I packed a midnight meal
for the proposal celebration,

50:10.742 --> 50:12.308
which, of course,
never happened.

50:12.310 --> 50:13.826
Okay, just get it!

50:13.827 --> 50:15.343
Okay, Paige, help me
re-tie the trigger rope.
On it.

50:19.384 --> 50:20.649
Chingwe:
200,000.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.718

51:18.676 --> 51:22.278
Do not offend my guest.

How many cards?

51:35.359 --> 51:36.525
One card.

Uh...

51:37.795 --> 51:39.829
Yes. One card.

What is he doing?

52:00.284 --> 52:01.283
(Grunts)

52:01.285 --> 52:03.035
Genius, huh?

52:03.036 --> 52:04.786
What kind of genius
busts a drawn straight?

52:04.789 --> 52:06.322
A confused kind.

52:06.324 --> 52:08.324
Why can't you guys
just nod "yes" and "no,"

52:08.326 --> 52:10.493
like every other country?

52:10.495 --> 52:14.463
"Fresh rinse of bel hair
cuts and shampoo."

52:16.134 --> 52:18.167
"Warlock's chest comic store"?

52:18.169 --> 52:19.602
I use punch cards.

52:19.604 --> 52:20.836
It's silly
if you don't.

52:20.838 --> 52:22.538
It's like leaving your money
on the table.

52:24.542 --> 52:25.908
That was a poor choice of words.

52:25.910 --> 52:27.209
I'm sorry.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.377
Bus pass?

52:32.850 --> 52:36.452
With stamp for
U.S. government

52:36.454 --> 52:38.687
employee discount.

52:38.689 --> 52:40.389
Online bank thieves?

52:40.391 --> 52:41.557
I doubt it.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.194
Your friend with
the slick hair,

52:45.196 --> 52:47.196
his name was
gallo, huh?

52:47.198 --> 52:50.866
"I won big for skunk.

52:50.868 --> 52:56.238
He's taking me out for

52:56.240 --> 52:57.439
We're not actually going

52:57.441 --> 52:58.741
to a celebration dinner,
are we?

53:02.547 --> 53:04.780
The guns keep on firing
whether I go forward or retreat.

53:04.782 --> 53:06.315
I'm dead if you don't hurry!

53:07.285 --> 53:08.484
Faster, Toby!

53:08.486 --> 53:09.485
Oh, you know,
rust, corrosion,

53:09.487 --> 53:10.619
you never see
it forming,

53:10.621 --> 53:11.687
and then one
day it's there.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.489
You know why?
I know why.

53:13.491 --> 53:14.657
And it's not because
of the analogy

53:14.659 --> 53:15.724
you're about to make.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.193
Because of neglect.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.461
Because of foreign elements
like air and water

53:19.463 --> 53:20.563
reacting with the iron.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.464
Elements the iron
never saw coming.

53:22.466 --> 53:23.799
Elements the iron was
completely blindsided by.

53:23.801 --> 53:25.367
Guys, Walter's being shot at.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.969
All I'm saying is...

53:29.574 --> 53:30.940
Paige:
Oh, boy!

53:30.942 --> 53:33.509
Miami, Portland, Boston,
launch your balls!

53:38.382 --> 53:39.882
It worked!

53:39.884 --> 53:42.318
The hackers don't have control
of the guns anymore.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.586
Captain, do you have
a status report?

53:43.588 --> 53:44.987
Captain conniff:
We have control of the vessel.

53:44.989 --> 53:46.555
Walt, get the hell
on that boat.

53:49.493 --> 53:51.627
Was a hell of a ride in,
Mr. o'brien.

53:51.629 --> 53:53.596
I'm captain conniff.
The bridge, captain. Now.

53:53.598 --> 53:54.964
You don't stand
on ceremony.

53:54.966 --> 53:56.465
Well, if I don't
reprogram

53:56.467 --> 53:58.067
your firmware
within 90 seconds,

53:58.068 --> 53:59.668
your ship goes back into
the hands of the hackers.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.005
We're losing
our aluminum cover.

54:03.007 --> 54:04.640
Ten seconds.

54:04.642 --> 54:05.775
The firmware
is reprogrammed.

54:05.776 --> 54:06.909
All the other
ships have to do

54:06.911 --> 54:08.611
is open this e-mail
and click the file.

54:08.613 --> 54:10.613
All the ships have the file
and the instructions.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.248
We have a clear sky.

54:12.250 --> 54:13.315
Did this work?

54:13.317 --> 54:16.385
(Computer beeping)

54:16.387 --> 54:18.904
Yep.

54:18.905 --> 54:21.422
Portland, Boston, Miami
are back under Navy's control.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.458
We're manually disabling
all weapons

54:22.460 --> 54:23.525
till this threat
is gone.

54:23.527 --> 54:24.860
It's a good start.

54:24.862 --> 54:26.695
Now we need to find
that missing nuclear sub.

54:26.697 --> 54:29.498
We may be taking the stinger
out of this operation soon.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.667
Tim and I are pulling up
to the hacker location

54:31.669 --> 54:32.935
skunk gave us.

54:38.042 --> 54:40.876
(Brakes squeak)

54:43.848 --> 54:44.813
(Car door closes)

54:49.020 --> 54:50.819
That's the building.

54:52.323 --> 54:53.622
Hey, hold on,
that's the building, too.

54:54.692 --> 54:56.625
Oh, man,
every apartment

54:56.627 --> 54:58.627
on this block
is 236 cherkovna.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.995
Tim:
There must be 50 units.

54:59.997 --> 55:01.630
There's no way we got time
to check them all.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.898
Hey.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.069
Hey.

55:07.071 --> 55:08.504
Listen up.

55:08.506 --> 55:10.439
I got 500 American
for some information.

55:14.779 --> 55:16.645
Are all these units
236 cherkovna?

55:16.647 --> 55:19.782
236 a, b, c, d.

55:19.784 --> 55:21.684
All right, which one of them

55:21.686 --> 55:23.986
has a bunch of teenage boys
with computer skills?

55:25.623 --> 55:28.107
I tell you for a thousand.

55:28.108 --> 55:30.592
You know, the only thing I hate
more than street drug dealers

55:30.594 --> 55:31.960
is one that makes
my job harder.

55:31.962 --> 55:33.595
Tim:
Listen.

55:33.597 --> 55:35.030
You get them out here,
you get your grand.

55:35.032 --> 55:36.465
Okay?

55:36.467 --> 55:37.700
You're a
very angry man.

55:37.702 --> 55:39.468
Boss.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.520
(Cabe groans)

55:58.522 --> 56:00.489
I think they knew
we were coming.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.396
Now we're stuck
in the middle of Bulgaria

56:07.398 --> 56:09.131
with no leads
and no time.

56:09.133 --> 56:10.666
(Groaning):
Thanks.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.471
Maybe not.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.047
(Grunts)

56:25.049 --> 56:26.915
Stick with him!

56:26.917 --> 56:28.984
(Dog barking in distance)

56:36.494 --> 56:37.860
Give it up, kid.

56:41.132 --> 56:42.898
No idea what you just said.

56:44.568 --> 56:46.668
(Grunting)

56:46.670 --> 56:48.670
I'm pretty sure that was
Bulgarian for "ow."

56:48.672 --> 56:50.806
(Grunting)

56:50.808 --> 56:52.741
(Sonar beeping)

56:52.743 --> 56:54.610
Nothing.
So sign of the sub.

56:54.612 --> 56:56.745
Best course of action is
to get this ship to shore

56:56.747 --> 56:58.013
before something
else goes wrong.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.515
Walter:
What's that over there?

56:59.517 --> 57:00.916
That's just an air pocket
created by

57:00.918 --> 57:02.017
a massive school of fish.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.185
It's nothing.

57:03.187 --> 57:04.620
Uh, it depends if the air

57:04.622 --> 57:06.155
is made of oxygen
or something else.

57:07.091 --> 57:08.624
The pacific herring
will pass gas

57:08.626 --> 57:09.658
to create
distracting bubbles

57:09.660 --> 57:11.777
to confuse predators.

57:11.778 --> 57:13.895
You think the fish are farting
away from the submarine?

57:13.898 --> 57:15.031
Possibly.

57:15.032 --> 57:16.165
Just hold the sonar
for a moment.

57:16.167 --> 57:18.767
Let's see what's coming up
behind those fish.

57:22.072 --> 57:23.472
I want to find
this missing sub

57:23.474 --> 57:24.740
as bad as you do,
but there's nothing...

57:24.742 --> 57:25.741
Over there.
(Sonar pings)

57:25.743 --> 57:27.743
From the west.
I'll be damned.

57:27.745 --> 57:28.911
That's the sub.

57:31.482 --> 57:33.148
This is Walter o'brien,

57:33.150 --> 57:34.883
a government
tech contractor

57:34.885 --> 57:36.785
on board the USS<i> corbett,</i>

57:36.787 --> 57:39.455
trying to contact
the<i> Clayton.</i>

57:39.457 --> 57:40.722
Do you copy,<i> Clayton?</i>

57:42.593 --> 57:44.526
<i> Clayton,</i> do you copy?

57:46.530 --> 57:49.131
This is captain Braden
of the USS<i> Clayton.</i>

57:49.133 --> 57:51.700
<i> I hope you have some info</i>
<i> regarding our whereabouts.</i>

57:51.702 --> 57:53.035
We've been flying blind
for some time now.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.036
Walter:
Captain,

57:54.038 --> 57:56.138
you are headed due east.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.640
Your craft is approaching
the McEwan pipeline.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.142
Okay, now we know where I'm at,

58:00.144 --> 58:02.144
but I still don't have control
over my ship.

58:02.146 --> 58:03.245
Walter:
Understood.

58:03.247 --> 58:05.080
Finding you was step one.

58:05.082 --> 58:08.550
Bringing you and your nuclear
weapons in safely is step two.

58:08.552 --> 58:10.986
Just not sure how
to do that yet.

58:10.988 --> 58:13.489
Oh... that's our answer!

58:13.491 --> 58:16.625
When I was a kid, I got a metal
detector for my birthday,

58:16.627 --> 58:18.160
and I tested it out
by putting it up

58:18.162 --> 58:19.661
against our old tube TV.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.730
It created a magnetic field
that ruined the set.

58:21.732 --> 58:23.499
Dad was not happy.

58:23.501 --> 58:24.766
So you want to create
a magnetic field

58:24.768 --> 58:26.535
in the water to disrupt
the hackers' link

58:26.537 --> 58:27.703
to the sub's
computer system.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.271
We can use the McEwan pipeline.

58:29.273 --> 58:31.173
It's metal. If we put enough
strong magnets inside,

58:31.175 --> 58:32.975
it'll create a palpable
magnetic field.

58:32.977 --> 58:35.143
And when the sub passes
through the field

58:35.145 --> 58:36.645
and the hackers'
signal is disrupted,

58:36.647 --> 58:38.330
we reboot back control,

58:38.331 --> 58:40.014
and the<i> Clayton</i> quickly
gets to the surface

58:40.017 --> 58:41.149
and powers down the sub.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.718
Once we power down,

58:42.719 --> 58:44.286
they won't be able
to retake control of the vessel.

58:44.288 --> 58:46.021
We just float,
wait for rescue.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.524
One question-- how do we get
magnets inside a pipe

58:48.526 --> 58:49.892
that's full of thousands
of gallons of oil?

58:49.894 --> 58:51.994
We hack the system and drain
the pipe-- I can swing it.

58:51.996 --> 58:53.695
The base has several
decommissioned rail guns.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.697
They're full of
industrial-grade magnets.

58:55.699 --> 58:56.765
Uh, captain,
call the base.

58:56.767 --> 58:57.900
Tell them we're
on our way!

59:02.039 --> 59:04.106
(Folk music playing over radio)

59:05.309 --> 59:07.242
You know, Bulgaria is lovely.

59:08.312 --> 59:10.245
But not always.

59:10.247 --> 59:11.980
Like in 1928,

59:11.981 --> 59:13.714
when you guys had that
massive earthquake,

59:13.717 --> 59:16.251
and then America sent
a bunch of aid

59:16.253 --> 59:18.820
to help rebuild the region.

59:18.822 --> 59:20.689
America and Bulgaria
getting along!

59:20.691 --> 59:24.760
You lost me 250,000 lev.

59:24.762 --> 59:26.728
There's no talking your way
out of this.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.697
(Sighs)

59:32.336 --> 59:33.902
Wait a minute.

59:35.139 --> 59:36.939
I only lost 210,000.

59:36.941 --> 59:38.206
There was still chips
on the table

59:38.208 --> 59:39.308
when I was getting pulled away.

59:39.310 --> 59:40.809
Why don't you shut up?

59:40.811 --> 59:43.278
I lost exactly $209,420.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.280
And the bulge in
this guy's pocket

59:45.282 --> 59:47.182
is approximately
1.75 inches thick,

59:47.184 --> 59:48.617
which makes sense,

59:48.619 --> 59:50.836
since the
international standard

59:50.837 --> 59:53.054
for currency paper
is .0043 inches thick.

59:53.057 --> 59:55.257
400 $100 lev bills

59:55.259 --> 59:57.225
would be 1.72
inches thick,

59:57.227 --> 59:58.293
which is just
about my estimate.

59:58.295 --> 59:59.895
I said be quiet.

59:59.897 --> 1:00:02.331
No, you be quiet.

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:03.599
What are you saying?

1:00:03.601 --> 1:00:04.600
In short, Mr. skunk,

1:00:04.602 --> 1:00:05.934
the gorilla next to me

1:00:05.936 --> 1:00:06.969
has pocketed your money.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:08.337
He's liar.
(Whimpers)

1:00:08.339 --> 1:00:09.771
Pull over.

1:00:15.079 --> 1:00:17.346
(Owl hooting)

1:00:18.849 --> 1:00:20.315
I cashed in the chips.

1:00:20.317 --> 1:00:23.318
I forgot I put money
in the pocket.

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:24.886
Here.

1:00:24.888 --> 1:00:25.954
Honest mistake.

1:00:34.231 --> 1:00:35.297
Let's go.

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:45.741
(Grunts)

1:00:47.344 --> 1:00:49.344
How many magnets do we need?

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:51.647
Happy said at least 12.

1:00:54.284 --> 1:00:55.417
You hack the pipe yet?

1:00:55.419 --> 1:00:57.419
Uh, to completely
shut off oil flow

1:00:57.421 --> 1:00:58.320
for good
would take hours,

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.422
but best I can do is make

1:01:00.424 --> 1:01:02.090
the pipeline run
a diagnostic test.

1:01:02.092 --> 1:01:03.659
That'll stop the oil flow for

1:01:03.661 --> 1:01:05.427
about 12 minutes,
thus draining the pipe,

1:01:05.429 --> 1:01:08.697
but once the time's up,
the oil flow restarts.

1:01:08.699 --> 1:01:10.032
Anyone still in the pipe
drowns in oil.

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:11.617
Oh, sounds lovely.

1:01:11.618 --> 1:01:13.201
Got the reboot protocol
ready for the sub,

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:14.369
but you guys
have to hurry.

1:01:14.371 --> 1:01:16.405
The eta for the pipeline
is ten minutes.

1:01:16.407 --> 1:01:17.806
Soon as we're out of the hatch,

1:01:17.808 --> 1:01:19.291
drop this on the pipe,

1:01:19.292 --> 1:01:20.775
the charge will electrify
the magnetic field.

1:01:20.778 --> 1:01:22.044
Where did you get that?

1:01:22.046 --> 1:01:23.812
Let's just say
the officer's club

1:01:23.814 --> 1:01:24.946
doesn't have
air-conditioning anymore.

1:01:24.948 --> 1:01:27.783
You're a real live wire,
you know that?

1:01:27.785 --> 1:01:28.884
Guys, time's a factor.

1:01:28.886 --> 1:01:30.085
Right!

1:01:30.087 --> 1:01:31.720
Shutting off oil flow now.

1:01:31.722 --> 1:01:33.422
Happy, Paige,
let's get in that hatch

1:01:33.424 --> 1:01:34.756
and get that pallet inside.

1:01:38.328 --> 1:01:40.462
(Grunting)

1:01:40.464 --> 1:01:41.797
Where are your friends?

1:01:41.799 --> 1:01:43.732
Listen, I'm not Walter,
so I can't make

1:01:43.734 --> 1:01:45.967
heads or tails
of what's on this thing.

1:01:45.969 --> 1:01:47.703
My best guess

1:01:47.705 --> 1:01:49.104
is that after the hackers
realized that people

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:51.006
were onto them in the U.S.,
they ran off,

1:01:51.008 --> 1:01:52.374
set up shop
in some other locale.

1:01:52.376 --> 1:01:54.176
This guy stayed behind
with his tablet

1:01:54.178 --> 1:01:56.445
to keep the link
to our military assets

1:01:56.447 --> 1:01:58.814
connected until his pals
could finish up.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:02:00.716
Walter, do you copy?

1:02:00.718 --> 1:02:01.750
Cabe.

1:02:01.752 --> 1:02:03.418
I got nothing
off this kid.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:04.953
His tablet's gibberish.

1:02:04.955 --> 1:02:06.354
He doesn't speak any English.

1:02:06.356 --> 1:02:08.023
His pockets are empty
except for

1:02:08.025 --> 1:02:09.458
some cash,
an employee I.D. Card

1:02:09.460 --> 1:02:11.426
to a movie theater,
and a gum wrapper.

1:02:11.428 --> 1:02:13.028
He works in a movie theater?

1:02:13.030 --> 1:02:14.396
Apparently. Why?

1:02:14.398 --> 1:02:15.731
Most theaters show movies

1:02:15.733 --> 1:02:18.066
digitally now,
so that's 900 gigabits

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:19.234
per second,
so its movies

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:21.086
are beamed by satellite,
which means

1:02:21.087 --> 1:02:22.937
that theater is one of the only
places in Bulgaria

1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:24.740
that has the bandwidth necessary

1:02:24.742 --> 1:02:26.108
to implement
a military-grade hack.

1:02:26.110 --> 1:02:27.809
This jerk sent his pals
to the movies.

1:02:31.281 --> 1:02:34.282
Interpol will be by to get you
before it gets too cold.

1:02:41.425 --> 1:02:42.991
(Grunts)

1:02:42.993 --> 1:02:45.060
(Groans)

1:02:46.797 --> 1:02:49.331
My glasses. My glasses.

1:02:53.003 --> 1:02:54.436
(Gasps)

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:55.971
Are you okay?

1:02:55.973 --> 1:02:57.105
No.

1:02:57.107 --> 1:02:58.907
My friends and I are
in a lot of trouble,

1:02:58.909 --> 1:03:00.842
and I know it sounds crazy,
but millions could die,

1:03:00.844 --> 1:03:02.043
and they don't
even know it.

1:03:02.045 --> 1:03:03.044
I need to use
your phone.

1:03:03.046 --> 1:03:05.514
I'm afraid I don't own a phone.

1:03:07.151 --> 1:03:08.950
Well, what about
that thing?

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:11.553
Uh, plays white noise only.

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:14.055
I use to remove
distractions

1:03:14.057 --> 1:03:16.191
when I converse
with nature.

1:03:16.193 --> 1:03:18.059
Well, I can fix this
to call my friends.

1:03:18.061 --> 1:03:20.128
It is my husband mikael's,

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:22.063
but he won't mind.

1:03:22.065 --> 1:03:24.366
What you need is yours.

1:03:24.368 --> 1:03:26.268
(Chuckling):
Oh, thank you.

1:03:27.404 --> 1:03:29.905
The sub is two minutes
from the pipeline.

1:03:29.907 --> 1:03:31.139
Guys, I need an update.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.440
We're going
as fast as we can.

1:03:32.442 --> 1:03:34.476
It's dark, the
fumes are terrible,

1:03:34.478 --> 1:03:35.844
and we can barely see
where we're going.

1:03:35.846 --> 1:03:36.912
(Both scream)

1:03:38.081 --> 1:03:39.447
(Both grunt)

1:03:39.449 --> 1:03:40.582
You guys okay?

1:03:40.584 --> 1:03:44.152
Happy?!
Yeah, we're fine.

1:03:44.154 --> 1:03:45.587
Dirty, but fine.

1:03:45.589 --> 1:03:48.590
Look for the hexagonal
13-c seal.

1:03:48.592 --> 1:03:51.193
Put the magnets along that seam.

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.129
I found it.

1:04:07.110 --> 1:04:10.245
Sonar's picked up mass readings
of the magnetic field.

1:04:10.247 --> 1:04:12.347
It's working,
but you guys have to hurry.

1:04:12.349 --> 1:04:13.882
Toby:
Really hurry!

1:04:13.884 --> 1:04:15.050
In a few minutes,
the pipeline's

1:04:15.052 --> 1:04:16.335
diagnostic is over

1:04:16.336 --> 1:04:17.619
and you are gonna drown
in liquid dinosaur.

1:04:24.995 --> 1:04:27.162
(Muttering):
Hmm, let's go up here.

1:04:27.164 --> 1:04:29.397
(Radio warbling,
static crackling)

1:04:29.399 --> 1:04:31.466
♪ ♪

1:04:34.471 --> 1:04:36.938
Thank you, bilyana.

1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:41.409
Oh, you have done so much
in so little time.

1:04:41.411 --> 1:04:42.410
It's so peaceful here.

1:04:42.412 --> 1:04:44.362
You know, I work really...

1:04:44.363 --> 1:04:46.313
I really work better
in a more calm environment.

1:04:46.316 --> 1:04:49.251
Where I work, everyone
is so mad at each other.

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:52.320
I really envy you
and your husband's solitude.

1:04:52.322 --> 1:04:53.355
(Chuckles)

1:04:53.357 --> 1:04:55.023
You see, mikael?

1:04:55.025 --> 1:04:59.895
We got it so good,
even American is envious.

1:05:00.998 --> 1:05:03.198
Oh, that is mikael?

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:05.400
A... ficus?

1:05:05.402 --> 1:05:07.235
Yes.

1:05:07.237 --> 1:05:10.138
Well, I hate to radio and run,

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:11.239
but i-i just need to reset
this crank

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:13.074
co I can get a call
up to my pilot.

1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:19.347
It's time to finish
our drive.

1:05:21.685 --> 1:05:24.519
Thank you for your help.

1:05:24.521 --> 1:05:25.954
Shall we?

1:05:27.557 --> 1:05:29.691
(Clanking)

1:05:29.693 --> 1:05:31.126
Okay, that's the last of them--
is that enough, Walter?

1:05:31.128 --> 1:05:32.360
The magnetic field is strong,

1:05:32.362 --> 1:05:34.329
and the sub's already
entered it.

1:05:34.331 --> 1:05:35.931
But it won't disrupt
the hackers' signal

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:37.399
unless there is
an electric current

1:05:37.401 --> 1:05:38.500
running through it,
so get out.

1:05:38.502 --> 1:05:39.701
Now.

1:05:42.105 --> 1:05:44.172
Sub's halfway through the field.
Toby, get the current ready.

1:05:44.174 --> 1:05:46.441
I'm holding old sparky
as I speak.

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:49.077
You drop that wire while Paige
and happy are still inside,

1:05:49.079 --> 1:05:50.578
the current's gonna ignite
that residual oil,

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:52.013
and they will be burned alive!

1:05:52.015 --> 1:05:53.615
Hey, Tim, I'm a genius.

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:55.050
I know how fuel
and electricity work.

1:05:59.189 --> 1:06:00.655
(Grunts, gasps)

1:06:00.657 --> 1:06:02.390
Move it!

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:05.026
I can't help it if I'm not
wearing men's combat boots.

1:06:05.028 --> 1:06:06.594
They're called
steel-toed work boots,

1:06:06.596 --> 1:06:08.363
and they're headed for your butt
if you don't grab my hand!

1:06:08.365 --> 1:06:10.165
(Grunting)

1:06:10.167 --> 1:06:11.466
Toby:
Guys!

1:06:11.468 --> 1:06:14.102
Give or take 20 seconds,
and you're covered in oil!

1:06:14.104 --> 1:06:16.171
Not in the fun,
bikini-wrestling way!

1:06:16.173 --> 1:06:17.973
The sub's almost
out of the field.

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:20.008
We're losing our window
to regain control of the vessel.

1:06:21.078 --> 1:06:23.678
(Both grunting)

1:06:24.982 --> 1:06:26.314
Run!

1:06:26.316 --> 1:06:30.051
You have ten seconds!
Where the hell are you guys?

1:06:30.053 --> 1:06:31.419
Right here!

1:06:34.157 --> 1:06:36.091
Light it up!

1:06:38.996 --> 1:06:40.028
(Electrical humming)

1:06:40.030 --> 1:06:40.996
Paige:
We dropped the wire!

1:06:40.998 --> 1:06:42.063
The magnetic field

1:06:42.065 --> 1:06:43.565
is perfectly charged.

1:06:43.567 --> 1:06:45.600
But the sub's
past through range.

1:06:45.602 --> 1:06:47.035
We missed it by seconds.

1:06:47.037 --> 1:06:47.869
Braden:
Confirmed.

1:06:47.870 --> 1:06:48.702
But I still don't have control

1:06:48.705 --> 1:06:49.704
over my ship.

1:06:49.706 --> 1:06:51.356
Toby:
Uh, Walt,

1:06:51.357 --> 1:06:53.007
remember when you tried
to screw with the signal

1:06:53.010 --> 1:06:55.443
from the Pentagon office
and they destroyed a high-rise?

1:06:55.445 --> 1:06:56.595
What do you think
they'll do now?

1:06:56.596 --> 1:06:57.746
(Alarm blaring)
Sounds like retaliate.

1:06:57.748 --> 1:06:59.631
What you hear

1:06:59.632 --> 1:07:01.515
is a nuclear missile going
into launch prep sequence.

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:02.717
The hackers are
launching a warhead?

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:04.219
It's more peacocking.

1:07:04.221 --> 1:07:05.653
They're showing buyers
the full extent

1:07:05.655 --> 1:07:08.089
of what they'll do if anyone
tries to screw with 'em

1:07:08.091 --> 1:07:09.424
like we just did.

1:07:09.425 --> 1:07:10.758
Preliminary data
guarantees a strike

1:07:10.761 --> 1:07:12.594
on the continental
United States.

1:07:12.596 --> 1:07:14.195
Cabe, we've got countdown
on a missile

1:07:14.197 --> 1:07:15.697
that travels
14,000 miles per hour,

1:07:15.699 --> 1:07:18.133
and the only way to stop it is
you getting to those hackers

1:07:18.135 --> 1:07:20.468
and snuffing the signal
that's controlling all of this.

1:07:20.470 --> 1:07:21.703
I'm driving
a two-cylinder lawn mower,

1:07:21.705 --> 1:07:23.155
and I've got it floored,

1:07:23.156 --> 1:07:24.606
and we're still a few minutes
from the theater.

1:07:24.608 --> 1:07:26.307
(Alarm blaring)
That's gonna be a problem

1:07:26.309 --> 1:07:28.209
'cause this missile launches
in less than three minutes.

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:29.444
And I just ran the coordinates.

1:07:29.446 --> 1:07:31.713
It's headed for Cody, Wyoming.

1:07:31.715 --> 1:07:33.048
Toby:
Population 10,000.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:35.683
Hackers made
a very strategic choice:

1:07:35.685 --> 1:07:37.485
Demonstrate
their destructive ability

1:07:37.487 --> 1:07:39.287
without completely
crippling the country.

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:40.688
Because crippling
the country is what they're

1:07:40.690 --> 1:07:42.440
going to be selling
for billions.

1:07:42.441 --> 1:07:44.191
We're looking at a blast radius
of three miles,

1:07:44.194 --> 1:07:46.494
immediately vaporizing
all of Cody's residents.

1:07:46.496 --> 1:07:48.630
With the fallout
affecting millions.

1:07:48.632 --> 1:07:50.799
I can assure you none of that
is going to happen.

1:07:50.801 --> 1:07:52.233
The missiles won't fire

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:54.369
because we can manually
disengage our reactor,

1:07:54.371 --> 1:07:56.104
causing the sub to sink.

1:07:56.106 --> 1:07:57.806
The missile can't fire
without power.

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:02.077
And your ship can't resurface,
and you and your men die.

1:08:02.079 --> 1:08:04.112
Braden: There's only 110 of us.
It's a good trade.

1:08:04.114 --> 1:08:05.113
Sir, you can't do that.

1:08:05.115 --> 1:08:06.114
You're only in this situation

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:07.482
because I slipped on the incline

1:08:07.484 --> 1:08:09.117
and we didn't get the wire
on the pipe in time.

1:08:09.119 --> 1:08:10.218
Walter, it is my fault.

1:08:10.220 --> 1:08:11.653
Braden:
It's what we signed up for

1:08:11.655 --> 1:08:13.438
when we volunteered, ma'am.
Walter: No, no, captain.

1:08:13.439 --> 1:08:15.222
I understand the greater-good
concept better than anyone,

1:08:15.225 --> 1:08:16.391
but you're not
thinking logically.

1:08:16.393 --> 1:08:18.526
With respect,
we can find a way...

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:19.978
He's thinking
like a military leader.

1:08:19.979 --> 1:08:21.429
I only want to hear
from geniuses at this moment.

1:08:21.431 --> 1:08:22.697
What? Cabe and i
are the only ones

1:08:22.699 --> 1:08:23.832
that understand
this situation, Walter.

1:08:23.834 --> 1:08:25.517
Paige:
Hey!

1:08:25.518 --> 1:08:27.201
If we want to stop America
from attacking itself,

1:08:27.204 --> 1:08:28.403
we need to stop
attacking each other.

1:08:28.405 --> 1:08:30.288
So shut up and grow up

1:08:30.289 --> 1:08:32.172
because we have about a minute
to save 110 sailors

1:08:32.175 --> 1:08:34.175
and over 10,000 people
before that missile takes off.

1:08:34.177 --> 1:08:35.176
Braden:
Negative.

1:08:35.178 --> 1:08:36.961
Our duty is to protect

1:08:36.962 --> 1:08:38.745
our nation's citizens,
and I'm about to see it through.

1:08:38.748 --> 1:08:41.249
Captain, you also have
a duty to your crew.

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:44.152
And if you sacrifice their lives
without getting all the facts,

1:08:44.154 --> 1:08:45.286
then you've failed
them as a leader!

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:46.821
If my team says
they can pull it off,

1:08:46.823 --> 1:08:48.790
they can pull it off.

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:51.459
From one military man
to another, trust us.

1:08:51.461 --> 1:08:53.561
And it will require
a lot of trust,

1:08:53.563 --> 1:08:55.296
because I have a solution.

1:08:55.298 --> 1:08:57.499
But for it to work, the first
thing you need to do, captain,

1:08:57.501 --> 1:08:59.434
is allow that nuclear missile
to launch.

1:09:04.741 --> 1:09:06.641
I'm sorry, Walter.
I-i thought I just heard you say

1:09:06.643 --> 1:09:09.410
that we should
let the missile launch.

1:09:09.412 --> 1:09:12.680
Yes! Now, the nuke travels
so fast that within seconds,

1:09:12.682 --> 1:09:14.415
it'll be so far away
from the sub

1:09:14.417 --> 1:09:16.484
that the sub's computer system
will no longer control it.

1:09:16.486 --> 1:09:18.720
Then the missile's own
computer GPS kicks in.

1:09:18.722 --> 1:09:20.588
And Walter can hack that system.

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:22.490
I'll redirect the GPS

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:25.260
and send it to a deep ocean
trench with soft silt,

1:09:25.262 --> 1:09:26.928
where it will settle
without detonating.

1:09:26.930 --> 1:09:28.363
That would be the tongo trench

1:09:28.365 --> 1:09:30.431
in the south pacific.

1:09:30.433 --> 1:09:32.167
They have less than 30 seconds
to launch.

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:33.501
You better be sure about this,
Mr. o'brien.

1:09:33.503 --> 1:09:35.336
Happy:
From launch to impact in Cody

1:09:35.338 --> 1:09:37.105
is about 3.8 minutes.

1:09:37.106 --> 1:09:38.873
And once I start messing around
with the missile's GPS,

1:09:38.875 --> 1:09:41.376
the hackers will see what I'm
doing and then try and stop us,

1:09:41.378 --> 1:09:42.710
so whoever hacks
the fastest wins.

1:09:42.712 --> 1:09:43.878
It's our only option.

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:45.180
Tim:
Speaking of hackers,
we're here.

1:09:45.182 --> 1:09:46.881
Walter: The servers need
to be kept cool

1:09:46.883 --> 1:09:48.516
so the top floors
are easy to ventilate.

1:09:48.518 --> 1:09:49.951
Countdown to launch.

1:09:49.953 --> 1:09:51.252
In five...

1:09:51.254 --> 1:09:51.886
Four...

1:09:51.888 --> 1:09:52.921
Three...

1:09:52.923 --> 1:09:55.190
Two... launch.

1:09:55.192 --> 1:09:57.258
(Rocket whooshing)

1:10:02.499 --> 1:10:04.966
I'm into the missile's GPS.

1:10:04.968 --> 1:10:06.968
If the hackers are watching,
they'll see pretty quickly.

1:10:06.970 --> 1:10:08.937
Uh, they're in.
They're rewriting my code

1:10:08.939 --> 1:10:10.338
as soon as I finish.

1:10:10.340 --> 1:10:11.606
Well, don't let them.

1:10:11.608 --> 1:10:12.774
Not that easy.

1:10:12.776 --> 1:10:14.275
Their advantage is

1:10:14.277 --> 1:10:15.944
they already hacked
the sub's platform codes,

1:10:15.946 --> 1:10:17.712
which are also
in the missile.

1:10:17.714 --> 1:10:19.948
It's like they have an 80-yard
head start in a 100-yard dash.

1:10:19.950 --> 1:10:22.383
Man, why do we always have
to suck at sports?

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:23.985
They're setting up
a permanent blocking program

1:10:23.987 --> 1:10:26.654
that'll stop me
from redirecting the missile.

1:10:26.656 --> 1:10:28.423
Walter:
I can't stop them.

1:10:28.425 --> 1:10:30.792
Best I can do
is set up some roadblocks

1:10:30.794 --> 1:10:32.460
that'll slow them down
until cabe gets them.

1:10:32.462 --> 1:10:33.828
Clear.
Walter:
Cabe?

1:10:33.830 --> 1:10:36.264
Closing in on them now.
Walter: Hurry!

1:10:36.266 --> 1:10:38.800
The nuke detonates over Cody
in 150 seconds.

1:10:38.802 --> 1:10:39.934
Right now,
they're finishing a code

1:10:39.936 --> 1:10:42.270
<i> that guarantees</i>
<i> a nuclear strike.</i>

1:10:42.272 --> 1:10:43.571
<i> I'm watching their work</i>
<i> as I speak.</i>

1:10:43.573 --> 1:10:45.240
<i> I'm barely slowing them down.</i>

1:10:45.242 --> 1:10:46.541
<i> Cabe, I'm throwing</i>
<i> every hurdle I can</i>

1:10:46.543 --> 1:10:48.009
at them-- they're just
an entry key away

1:10:48.011 --> 1:10:49.344
from countless people dying.

1:10:52.983 --> 1:10:54.315
(Chuckles)

1:10:54.317 --> 1:10:55.316
(Gunshot)

1:10:55.318 --> 1:10:56.584
On the ground!

1:10:56.586 --> 1:10:57.986
Hands behind
your head.

1:10:57.988 --> 1:11:01.256
You don't move,
i won't shoot you.

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:02.624
Cabe:
Okay, Walter,

1:11:02.625 --> 1:11:03.991
we disconnected their signal
analog style.

1:11:03.994 --> 1:11:05.026
Do your thing.

1:11:05.028 --> 1:11:06.027
Great work, cabe.

1:11:06.029 --> 1:11:08.429
Entering the coordinates.

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:15.770
Missile redirected.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:18.023
Braden:
This is captain Braden.

1:11:18.024 --> 1:11:20.275
Happy to report we have
full control over the vessel,

1:11:20.277 --> 1:11:23.278
and all readings show
our missile is headed directly

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:25.330
to the tongo trench.

1:11:25.331 --> 1:11:27.381
Okay, Tim and I will pick sly up
from dinner,

1:11:27.384 --> 1:11:28.850
and we're on our way home.

1:11:28.852 --> 1:11:30.885
Man, we're all
sweating it out here,

1:11:30.887 --> 1:11:33.788
and sly gets to gamble
and have a fancy dinner?

1:11:33.790 --> 1:11:36.324
Love to trade places
with that guy.

1:11:37.661 --> 1:11:39.027
American westerns

1:11:39.029 --> 1:11:41.796
always let the hero
say last words.

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:42.864
(Cocks gun)

1:11:42.866 --> 1:11:44.999
But this is not movie.

1:11:45.001 --> 1:11:47.502
That's okay.
All I was gonna say is "duck."

1:11:47.504 --> 1:11:48.503
Hmm?

1:11:48.505 --> 1:11:49.737
(Whooshing)

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:54.075
(Laughing)

1:11:57.314 --> 1:11:58.780
(Laughs)

1:11:58.782 --> 1:12:00.815
In American westerns,

1:12:00.817 --> 1:12:04.352
the hero sometimes tells
the bad guys

1:12:04.354 --> 1:12:06.954
to try their luck.

1:12:06.956 --> 1:12:08.423
But this isn't a movie.

1:12:11.594 --> 1:12:13.094
I already racked it.

1:12:13.096 --> 1:12:14.896
Oh, I thought I...

1:12:14.898 --> 1:12:16.331
I thought I could... you know...

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:18.066
No. It's racked.

1:12:18.068 --> 1:12:21.035
(Clearing throat):
Okay, well I thought
it was going to be cool, so...

1:12:21.037 --> 1:12:22.337
Bruce:
Big guy.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:23.805
Oh, thank god.
Here, please, please,

1:12:23.807 --> 1:12:25.506
please, take this from me.
Okay, all right.

1:12:25.508 --> 1:12:27.075
Okay.
Time to say good-bye.

1:12:27.077 --> 1:12:28.910
How did you find out
where I was?

1:12:28.912 --> 1:12:31.346
Someone named mikael contacted

1:12:31.348 --> 1:12:32.880
the plane's radio,
left coordinates in the woods,

1:12:32.882 --> 1:12:34.716
I picked up the car,
followed you here.

1:12:34.718 --> 1:12:37.418
Feels good to have completed
a real mission.

1:12:37.420 --> 1:12:38.920
You said it was
mikael who called?

1:12:38.922 --> 1:12:40.088
Oh, yeah. Funny fella.

1:12:40.090 --> 1:12:41.840
Sounded like a girl.

1:12:41.841 --> 1:12:43.591
Let's go find
your friends.
Okay. Sounds good.

(Voice mail beeps)
You have one new message.

1:13:11.121 --> 1:13:12.420
Man:
Hello, Ms. dineen.

1:13:12.421 --> 1:13:13.720
This is
the Tahoe crystal lake resort.

1:13:13.723 --> 1:13:16.157
We're sorry your stay with us
was cut short,

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:17.292
but we'd like to offer you...

1:13:17.293 --> 1:13:18.426
(Voice mail clicks off,
door opens)

1:13:18.428 --> 1:13:19.927
Sylvester:
Everybody!

1:13:19.929 --> 1:13:21.829
I got papa carpinni's.

1:13:21.831 --> 1:13:26.501
I got lasagna, eggplant parm,
chicken parm.

1:13:26.503 --> 1:13:29.036
Cabe and Tim
are debriefing homeland.

1:13:29.038 --> 1:13:30.354
They should be back soon.

1:13:30.355 --> 1:13:31.671
Oh, nobody touch
cabe's garlic bread.

1:13:31.674 --> 1:13:33.708

1:13:39.883 --> 1:13:43.451
You know, the reason
i love papa carpinni's

1:13:43.453 --> 1:13:45.720
is because they serve
their food family style.

1:13:45.722 --> 1:13:49.090
And anyone who isn't
willing to accept

1:13:49.092 --> 1:13:52.059
the family-style arrangements
at scorpion

1:13:52.061 --> 1:13:53.494
doesn't get to eat...
(Snapping fingers)

1:13:53.496 --> 1:13:55.730
The family-style
offerings.

1:13:55.732 --> 1:13:57.165
Which is a shame,

1:13:57.167 --> 1:13:59.700
because in my experience,
family style

1:13:59.702 --> 1:14:02.503
has a lot of great benefits.

1:14:02.505 --> 1:14:03.638
We get it.

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:05.072
Your analogy is as heavy-handed

1:14:05.074 --> 1:14:06.674
as Toby's aluminum ball speech.

1:14:06.676 --> 1:14:07.809
Let's just eat.

1:14:08.945 --> 1:14:10.211
No.

1:14:10.213 --> 1:14:12.547
It's been so tense around here

1:14:12.549 --> 1:14:14.582
that I wanted to leave
you people

1:14:14.584 --> 1:14:16.184
for the first time
in my life.

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:17.985
And when I did,
i got so far away,

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:19.454
I was in the
middle of nowhere,

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:21.456
and you know
what I learned?

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:23.090
Being alone sucks.

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:24.959
You wind up
talking to plants.

1:14:24.961 --> 1:14:26.828
And you guys are acting

1:14:26.830 --> 1:14:28.830
mad and-and weird

1:14:28.832 --> 1:14:30.498
around each other.

1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:32.066
And it's different.

1:14:32.068 --> 1:14:33.468
And I hate it.

1:14:34.671 --> 1:14:37.205
So... no.

1:14:37.207 --> 1:14:41.242
Nobody gets any food
until I hear it.

1:14:47.050 --> 1:14:48.950
I'm willing to
eat family style.

1:14:48.952 --> 1:14:52.587
Toby? Are you willing to eat
family style?

1:14:52.589 --> 1:14:54.722
Is this the whole family?

1:14:54.724 --> 1:14:55.990
Like, you, me and your husband?

1:14:55.992 --> 1:14:57.692
Toby.
See?

1:14:57.694 --> 1:15:01.128
Fine. I can eat family style.

1:15:01.130 --> 1:15:03.030
But it's got to be
a family of two.

1:15:03.032 --> 1:15:06.567
I promise I will fix
my situation.

1:15:19.115 --> 1:15:21.048
Actually, I'm not
that hungry.

1:15:27.090 --> 1:15:28.689
All right.

1:15:28.691 --> 1:15:30.925
Papa carpinni's.

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:33.094
You better not have messed
with my garlic bread.

1:15:33.096 --> 1:15:35.696
Hey.
Glad you guys are home again.

1:15:35.698 --> 1:15:37.064
Good to be home.

1:15:41.604 --> 1:15:43.137
Minute to talk?

1:15:43.139 --> 1:15:44.272
Sure.

1:15:48.244 --> 1:15:49.710
So, uh, earlier today,

1:15:49.712 --> 1:15:51.145
Tim wanted to knock
your head off.

1:15:52.148 --> 1:15:53.581
And I stood up for you,

1:15:53.583 --> 1:15:55.016
not because you're right,

1:15:55.018 --> 1:15:57.151
but because I care for you,

1:15:57.153 --> 1:15:59.654
and I know how bad
it hurts to lose

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:01.656
a woman you have
feelings for.

1:16:01.658 --> 1:16:03.090
Paige and I are only...

1:16:03.092 --> 1:16:05.092
Stop it, son.

1:16:05.094 --> 1:16:06.961
In this area,
I'm substantially

1:16:06.963 --> 1:16:08.062
smarter than you are.

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:10.131
At the end of the day,

1:16:10.133 --> 1:16:11.799
Paige is an amazing person.

1:16:11.801 --> 1:16:12.900
Agreed.

1:16:12.902 --> 1:16:14.702
And you messed
with her life.

1:16:15.939 --> 1:16:19.040
You pulled pranks to disrupt
her relationship with Tim.

1:16:19.042 --> 1:16:20.141
That's high school nonsense.

1:16:20.143 --> 1:16:23.077
Yeah, it wasn't
my finest moment.

1:16:23.079 --> 1:16:24.745
It hurts me to
tell you this,

1:16:24.747 --> 1:16:27.048
but you like facts,
so here it is:

1:16:27.050 --> 1:16:28.849
She deserves more than
you're capable of giving her

1:16:28.851 --> 1:16:30.251
at this stage in your life.

1:16:31.588 --> 1:16:33.721
I thought you cared for me.

1:16:33.723 --> 1:16:35.656
And that's why I'm
telling you this.

1:16:36.593 --> 1:16:38.993
You're not fully formed yet.

1:16:38.995 --> 1:16:41.362
You're almost there,
but you're half-baked.

1:16:41.364 --> 1:16:43.864
And for you to try
to go to win the love

1:16:43.866 --> 1:16:46.033
of a woman like Paige
before you're ready

1:16:46.035 --> 1:16:48.235
is selfish and wrong.

1:16:48.237 --> 1:16:50.104
And it's not fair to her.

1:16:50.106 --> 1:16:52.173
(Sighs)

1:16:56.312 --> 1:16:59.914
I'm concerned that
if I wait too long...

1:16:59.916 --> 1:17:02.183
Uh, I've waited too long.

1:17:02.185 --> 1:17:04.685
Yep.
You could lose her,

1:17:04.687 --> 1:17:07.288
but it's not about you.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.323
It's about Paige.

1:17:09.325 --> 1:17:11.258
It's about the whole team.

1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:12.627
It's about Ralph.

1:17:12.629 --> 1:17:14.261
These are real stakes, son.

1:17:23.106 --> 1:17:24.171
Uh, Tim.

1:17:24.173 --> 1:17:26.240
I-i know you wanted

1:17:26.242 --> 1:17:27.375
to talk with me,

1:17:27.377 --> 1:17:30.177
but I think I can
save us both time.

1:17:33.216 --> 1:17:36.283
I'm sorry for what I did.

1:17:36.285 --> 1:17:38.319
I won't cause
any future problems.

1:17:41.658 --> 1:17:42.990
Really?

1:17:45.395 --> 1:17:47.695
Okay.

1:17:47.697 --> 1:17:49.964
Thank you.

1:17:49.966 --> 1:17:51.332
Okay.

1:17:51.334 --> 1:17:53.167
Hey, Tim...
You want a plate?

1:17:54.137 --> 1:17:56.303
Uh, no. I'm good.
Thank you.

1:17:56.305 --> 1:17:58.272
Uh, Paige and I are actually
gonna go pick up Ralph,

1:17:58.274 --> 1:18:00.074
and then go to
Betty's restaurant.

1:18:00.076 --> 1:18:03.210
Apple juice for the kid,
live jazz for us.

1:18:03.212 --> 1:18:04.278
Ah, I'm pooped.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:05.946
I'm gonna take my pasta home.

1:18:05.948 --> 1:18:08.716
Sly, I can give
you a lift.

1:18:08.718 --> 1:18:10.818
Walter destroyed
my ride, so...

1:18:10.820 --> 1:18:12.219
I guess we'll take
the company car.

1:18:12.221 --> 1:18:15.322
Cabe, I picked up,
so you can clean up.

1:18:15.324 --> 1:18:16.424
Happy:
I'm going, too.

1:18:16.426 --> 1:18:17.925
I'll see you
guys tomorrow.

1:18:20.296 --> 1:18:21.328
Have a good night, Walter.

1:18:21.330 --> 1:18:24.465
Yeah, uh, you, too.

1:18:29.839 --> 1:18:32.440
(Door closes)

1:18:39.282 --> 1:18:40.881
Woman:
Hello. How may I help you?

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:42.249
Yes, hello.
Uh, health department?

1:18:42.251 --> 1:18:44.151
Yeah, I would like
to make a complaint

1:18:44.153 --> 1:18:46.220
about Betty's restaurant.

1:18:47.757 --> 1:18:50.191
(Sighs)

1:18:50.193 --> 1:18:52.793
Sir? Are you still there?

1:18:53.996 --> 1:18:55.796
Yeah, you know, uh,
i made a mistake.

1:18:55.798 --> 1:18:57.198
Sorry.

1:18:58.801 --> 1:19:00.868
