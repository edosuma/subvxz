00:54.805 --> 00:57.388
<i>They are coming to get you, Barbara.</i>

00:57.516 --> 00:59.723
<i>Stop it!
They are coming.</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:07.683
They don't like being awakened this way.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.436
Why do you have to be so mean?
Hey, I'm your older brother.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.612
Being mean and heartless
is part of my job.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.194
They're going
to get you, little sister.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.370
Johnnie, now you're being silly
and I don't want to hear it.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.914
Will you cut it out,
right now?

01:27.337 --> 01:30.250
You never know
when to stop, do you? Never!

01:32.593 --> 01:35.130
What's the matter, Barbara?
You gettin' scared?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.211
You're still scared
of her, aren't you?

01:37.306 --> 01:39.468
That's why
we're here, isn't it?

01:39.558 --> 01:42.801
No, that's not
why we're here.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.095
Tell me somethin', will ya?

01:46.189 --> 01:49.648
Why do we have to put ourselves
through this... charade?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.897
Because she is
our mother!

01:51.987 --> 01:54.274
Can't you at least give her
one day out of your life?

01:54.364 --> 01:57.231
One day? This is the fourth
time we've been up here...

01:57.326 --> 01:59.442
in the three months
since she died.

01:59.536 --> 02:03.120
I'm spending more time with her
now than when she was alive.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.706
And you know why?
Don't start.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.954
She couldn't possibly
be buried in the city.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.082
No. That would
have been much too easy.

02:10.172 --> 02:13.790
<i>She knew I'd have to be
the one to drive you up here.</i>

02:13.884 --> 02:17.548
That's why she had herself buried 200
miles from the nearest glass of beer.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.346
Johnnie, now we're here. Will
you just please stop it?

02:20.432 --> 02:23.094
Stop what?
The truth?

02:23.185 --> 02:26.177
She drove our father
to an early grave.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.182
She drove
me away from home,

02:28.315 --> 02:31.853
and she damned near drove you into a convent.
That's not true.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.353
When's the last time you had a date?
That is none of your business!

02:35.447 --> 02:38.690
The one thing
she never, ever drove...

02:38.784 --> 02:41.071
was 200 miles
to visit anything.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.780
Johnnie, please. Now, I need
you to stop talking like that.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.036
Don't talk like that.
Not here.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.083
What do you mean,
“not here”?

02:50.212 --> 02:53.955
Not here. Not in the middle of-
Of what?

02:54.049 --> 02:57.587
Show some respect.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.636
Ha! You're afraid,
aren't you?

03:00.764 --> 03:04.974
You really are afraid of this place.
God, you never stop!

03:07.562 --> 03:10.771
For the love of God, Johnnie.
Bastard!

03:10.899 --> 03:14.358
Jesus, you're weird. Let's just
get through this, can we, please?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.731
Just get it over with.

03:16.822 --> 03:20.190
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.118
- Barbara-
- For the love of God, Johnnie.

03:29.960 --> 03:35.581
They're horny, Barbara.
They've been dead a long time.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.924
Look! Look!
There's one of them now.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.304
He wants you!

03:44.391 --> 03:47.509
He's getting closer.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.975
Dangerously closer!
Stop it. John!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.647
He's going to hear you!

03:54.901 --> 03:58.565
It doesn't matter.
He knows we're here.

03:58.655 --> 04:03.240
It's too late now.
There's no escape!

04:03.326 --> 04:06.409
No, Mother!

04:06.496 --> 04:08.954
You bastard.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.119
Johnnie-

04:11.209 --> 04:14.747
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.795
Hey! I'm sorry.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.129
Hey, man, are you okay?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.840
Is there something
we can do to help?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.052
It's weird, huh?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.176
Aaah.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.513
- Aaah!
- Uh, uh- Oh-

04:39.279 --> 04:40.735
Oh-

05:11.770 --> 05:14.182
Johnnie!

05:15.982 --> 05:17.518
Johnnie!

05:25.200 --> 05:28.568
Help! Help!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.573
Please, my brother's hurt!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.933
Hey! Hey, mister! Hey!

05:53.937 --> 05:55.928
Please, we need help.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.888
Please, mister, help us.

06:33.268 --> 06:37.603
Oh, sh-
No! No!

07:51.012 --> 07:52.548
Hey. Hey!

07:52.639 --> 07:54.676
Hey! Is there anybody here?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.097
Hey!

07:58.228 --> 07:59.718
Hello?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.135
Hello?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.932
Hello.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.542
Hello?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.914
Hello?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.378
Hello?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.126
Hello?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.943
Oh, no!

11:09.919 --> 11:12.001
Oh-

11:39.657 --> 11:42.319
Anyone else inside?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.741
Huh?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.074
You got any shotguns in there?

11:47.165 --> 11:49.202
Hunting rifle, anything.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.125
I don't know.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.328
I don't know.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.547
What?
I don't-

11:57.675 --> 11:59.541
You don't know?
No.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.045
Hey. Hey.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.177
Hey. Hey. Hey.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.017
Hey, come on! Come on!

12:09.145 --> 12:11.261
Come on!

12:14.275 --> 12:16.482
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

12:16.611 --> 12:18.727
Come on.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.564
Come on!

12:22.700 --> 12:24.737
No! Come on.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.989
Come on!

12:29.123 --> 12:30.989
Come on. Come on.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.911
Come on!  No!

13:34.480 --> 13:36.847
Die! Damn it!

14:02.759 --> 14:04.670
Who is he?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.251
Do you know him?

14:11.434 --> 14:14.722
It's all right. it's all right.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.678
Did what you had to do.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.721
Do you know any of them?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.767
Ones outside?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.531
This isn't your house?

14:28.618 --> 14:32.202
You don't live here?

14:32.288 --> 14:36.282
Look. Talk to me, girl.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.368
Do you have a car?
Huh?

14:39.462 --> 14:42.671
Huh?

14:42.757 --> 14:46.045
Do you have a car?

14:46.135 --> 14:49.844
Yes. I- No. My brother-

14:55.812 --> 14:58.679
The windows. They're not strong
enough to break through the door,

14:58.773 --> 15:01.390
but they can get through
the window glass.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.435
Goddamn you!

17:11.321 --> 17:13.608
Goddamn all of you!

18:26.063 --> 18:27.599
Truck's on empty.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.938
We can't take the chance of running
dry out in the middle of nowhere.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.312
We'll hole up here.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.318
Hope that some help comes.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.083
My name is Ben.
What's your name?

18:51.672 --> 18:53.834
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.468
- Yes.
- Now look here, Barbara.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.138
I don't need you falling apart on me.
You understand?

19:02.224 --> 19:06.058
I see what you did over there. I
know you can fight when you have to.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.432
Well, you have to now.
Right now.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.264
Fight what you're thinkin'.
Fight what you're feelin'.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.566
The fight'll keep you strong,
keep you thinkin' straight.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.109
What's happening?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.690
I don't know.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.736
Nobody knows.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.210
Radio in the truck.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.669
All I heard was trash talk.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.720
Same as always.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.014
People tryin' to sound
like they know what's goin' on.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.012
They don't really know shit!

20:29.103 --> 20:30.639
Same as always.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.891
One guy saying it's...

20:39.071 --> 20:42.234
escaped prisoners on the loose
from up at Hennessey.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.861
Another guy saying it's...

20:44.952 --> 20:48.320
some kind of chemical spill
makin' everybody go crazy.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.914
They don't know shit.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.427
How do they explain...

21:05.514 --> 21:08.256
a man walkin' around
with his neck broken?

21:09.518 --> 21:12.601
A man shot full of holes...

21:12.688 --> 21:14.850
and still comin' at you?

21:18.360 --> 21:22.319
Assholes... down in Evans City
out for a good time...

21:22.406 --> 21:24.693
with their guns
and their six-packs.

21:26.619 --> 21:31.238
Assholes tryin' to round them up
and put them in the back of trucks.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.913
Like they know what
they going to do with them.

21:39.089 --> 21:43.708
They had 10, 20 of them
in the back of this panel truck.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.254
They opened the door
to let another one in.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.553
They come spillin' out of there...

21:52.603 --> 21:54.093
like bugs.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.292
I was at a diner.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.042
Windows shot out.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.178
Lady next to me shot dead.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.509
Others too.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.819
I saw six or seven go down.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.619
Car exploded outside.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.657
My car caught on fire.

23:40.753 --> 23:45.168
It was like- like a war.

23:47.885 --> 23:52.345
Some of those things
made it inside the diner.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.677
Started comin' after us.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.602
Some good ol'
boy comes chasin' him.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.476
Mean son of a bitch
got some kind of...

24:02.566 --> 24:04.853
hot-shit gun,
like an M-16 or somethin'.

24:04.944 --> 24:09.063
He starts-
shooting wild.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.615
Bullets tearin' up the place.

24:12.701 --> 24:17.787
I saw one of those things
take 30 hits and keep on comin'.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.161
The damn thing had to be dead,
but it kept on comin'...

24:22.252 --> 24:24.368
till it took a hit in the head.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.538
That brought it down.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.299
The only way to stop 'em-
You got to-

24:30.386 --> 24:31.876
You got to...

24:33.389 --> 24:35.050
get 'em in the head.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.970
Look, I don't know what's goin' on,

24:38.060 --> 24:40.722
but I sure as hell know
that it ain't no prison break.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.226
It ain't no kind of chemical that I ever
heard about can make a dead man walk.

24:46.318 --> 24:51.233
This is something that nobody has ever
heard about and nobody's ever seen before.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.699
This is hell on earth.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.372
This is pure hell on earth.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.265
Damn!

25:29.737 --> 25:32.980
Doesn't take long for the world
to fall apart, does it?

25:59.641 --> 26:02.133
There's got to be guns
in this house.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.146
Maybe upstairs.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.773
I'm going to go
take a look around.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.446
You all right down here alone?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.656
There's something up there.
What?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.822
What is it?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.403
It's all right.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.122
It's nothin' to worry about.

27:08.085 --> 27:12.044
- What is it?
- It's nothin'. It's nothin'.
It's all right.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.261
Ben!

28:05.934 --> 28:08.392
It's all right. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, mister!

28:08.478 --> 28:11.641
- It's just us!
- Who the hell is “us"?
- Tom Bitner, sir. That's me.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.185
Harry, what's going on?
This here's Harry Cooper.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.608
That's his wife callin'
down in the cellar.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.857
They got a sick little girl
down there too.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.439
My woman's down there too,
that's Judy Rose Larson.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.774
Um, that's all of us.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.780
Do you mind if we ask
who the hell you are now?

28:25.871 --> 28:30.035
- Girl's Barbara. I'm Ben.
- You damned near broke my arm, Mr. Ben.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.036
Harry, for God's sake!

28:32.127 --> 28:34.744
- Aren't you going to answer her?
- Harry, please answer me!

28:34.838 --> 28:36.829
Uh, it's all right.
We're all right.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.758
- There's some people up here.
- Didn't you hear all the noise up here?

28:40.844 --> 28:42.391
We could've used some help.

28:42.417 --> 28:45.454
Hey, maybe you can see through walls.
I can't.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.005
We heard some
bangin' around up here.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.262
It could've been those things
for all we could tell.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.310
We just heard
some bangin' around is all.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.307
No, no, that ain't right.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.607
We heard the girl callin' out,
askin' if anyone was here.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.560
We was just scared, that's all.
Want to know the truth?

28:59.655 --> 29:01.521
We was scared to hell.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.736
You live here, Tom?

29:07.246 --> 29:11.991
No. This is my Uncle Rege's house.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.825
Him and my cousin Satchel.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.914
Ol' Uncle Rege, he's dead.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.745
I seen him. I swear to God.
I touched him.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.455
He was stone cold dead.
He died today.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.415
- And that's the truth!
- Harry, please!

29:21.551 --> 29:24.839
Let's go. We can talk in the cellar.
Me and Judy Rose,

29:24.930 --> 29:26.762
we walked on over to be
with Satchel, you know?

29:26.848 --> 29:29.886
Radio said there was some kind of trouble.
We didn't see nothin'.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.934
We didn't see nothin'. Home to
here, we didn't see nothin'.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.887
Damn it!
We have heard all this before!

29:34.982 --> 29:37.770
I didn't hear it before, Cooper.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.941
Go on, Tom.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.521
Well, me and Judy Rose,
we walked on over like we said.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.777
We wasn't here more than 10
minutes when Mr. Cooper there,

29:45.867 --> 29:47.778
he come bangin' on the door.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.782
How'd you get here?
You don't look like neighbors.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.113
Oh, what? You tryin' to figure
out if somebody's got a car?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.119
You don't think we've
all been through this before?

29:55.210 --> 29:56.951
Mine is broken down
on the interstate,

29:57.045 --> 29:59.412
and the kid here doesn't own one,
if you can believe that.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.789
Damn!
What about you, Mr. Ben?

30:01.883 --> 30:04.716
You don't exactly look
like neighbors yourself.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.630
Truck- outside, out of gas. Gas?

30:09.725 --> 30:14.014
Evans City is five miles away.
Hey, we can make five miles on freakin' fumes!

30:14.104 --> 30:16.015
Yeah, what if
we don't make it?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.813
You willin' to take that chance?

30:17.899 --> 30:19.685
Besides,
Evans City's a war zone, man.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.358
I know. I been there.

30:21.445 --> 30:25.734
It's going to take us a hell of a lot more
than five miles before we find any real help.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.198
There's a gas pump out by the shed.
Huh?

30:28.285 --> 30:30.822
But Uncle Rege,
he keeps it locked.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.994
Do you know where the key is?

30:33.081 --> 30:36.199
No, but I could hunt for it.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.127
We will, but not now.
It could take too long.

30:40.213 --> 30:43.001
Besides, we might never find it.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.049
We got to figure out
what we're doin' first!

30:46.136 --> 30:49.049
- Finish your story, Tom.
- This is bullshit.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.255
If we're going to do something,
let's do it.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.967
If we're going to stand around and
bullshit, let's do it in the cellar...

30:54.102 --> 30:57.640
where it's safe. I'm not so sure goin'
down in that cellar is a smart move.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.684
What do you mean?
I mean I'm not so sure...

30:59.775 --> 31:02.233
lookin' ourselves down in that
cellar is such a smart move!

31:02.319 --> 31:04.731
I'm not goin' down there until
I know what all the options are.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.903
What damned options?

31:06.990 --> 31:10.028
And who the fuck gave you the right
to decide for the rest of us?

31:10.118 --> 31:12.530
I'm not deciding for you
or anybody else, Cooper.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.989
I'm thinkin' about my own ass!
Now, you want to go down in that cellar, go!

31:16.124 --> 31:19.037
Nobody's stoppin' you.
For God sakes, Harry, what's going on?

31:19.127 --> 31:21.869
Damn it, Helen!
Will you quit yelling at me?

31:21.963 --> 31:24.079
I can't think straight
with you yelling at me!

31:24.174 --> 31:27.383
You know, I've only been
around you a minute or two,

31:27.469 --> 31:30.052
but that's enough time for me
to know that I don't like you.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.425
I'm sure you feel the same
about me, so let's just...

31:32.516 --> 31:34.974
try to stay out of each
other's way, all right?

31:38.438 --> 31:40.975
Go on, Tom.
What else you got to tell?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.231
Well, like I said,

31:46.321 --> 31:50.736
Judy Rose and I, we wasn't here
more than 10 minutes, and...

31:50.826 --> 31:53.113
Mr. Cooper, he come bangin'
on the door, you know.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.410
We let him in,
him and his wife,

31:55.497 --> 31:57.454
and I seen
their little girl was hurt,

31:57.541 --> 31:59.077
so I, uh-

31:59.167 --> 32:01.124
I tried to call for help, you know.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.122
The phone's makin' this funny sound.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.623
Tried and tried,
and I couldn't call nobody.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.798
That's when Uncle Rege, uh,

32:09.636 --> 32:12.298
he come walkin' out
of the bedroom, you know?

32:12.389 --> 32:14.847
He was dead a minute before.
I swear to God.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.221
<i>He was not dead.
He couldn't have been.</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:21.645
Y-You were wrong.
You made a mistake. That's all.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.650
He was dead.
I know he was.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.853
What happened?

32:29.948 --> 32:33.691
Uncle Rege, he went
after my cousin Satchel.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.449
H-He- He went
after him like, uh-

32:39.833 --> 32:41.494
I don't know.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.875
Anybody else in the house?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.536
No, just them.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.636
Tom, I'm afraid
your cousin is dead.

32:53.722 --> 32:58.137
Uh-huh. I know he's dead.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.716
Shot himself.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.097
I mean, Uncle Rege comin'
after him and all, you know?

33:04.191 --> 33:06.307
I run down here and got the
shotgun, but what could I do?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.358
I couldn't imagine
shootin' Uncle Rege.

33:09.863 --> 33:13.527
Couldn't imagine
doin' a thing like that.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.154
And that's when I told everyone
to go down in the cellar.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.236
Goin' down in the cellar,
that's my idea.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.744
- It was a good idea.
- Look. Look outside.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.675
- Into the cellar, quick.
- No, that cellar's a death trap.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.381
Those things don't have much strength,

33:38.475 --> 33:41.012
but get enough together. they may
be able to break through the door.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.684
Be cornered down there.
No way out.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.729
We'd do better fightin' 'em off here
where there's still some way to escape.

33:45.815 --> 33:48.807
A way out is a way in.
T-The windows-

33:48.944 --> 33:50.901
Maybe we can board 'em up.
There's no time.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.396
Those things are- Look, there's
only three of them, man.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.857
I've handled more than that by myself.
We found these two guns.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.363
I'm worried about more of 'em comin'.
That cellar door won't hold 'em.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.696
- Oh, and the windows will.
- Look, I don't need this!

34:01.790 --> 34:05.408
I told you before, you want
to go downstairs, go on. Get!

34:05.502 --> 34:08.244
You can be boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.454
What you going
to do, Tom?

34:15.512 --> 34:19.505
Judy Rose, come on up.
We need your help.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.591
You're crazy!
You're out of your minds.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.518
This here's Judy Rose.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.138
Go get them old shelves out of the kitchen.
What are we doin' now?

34:28.525 --> 34:31.438
We're going to board up them windows.
Tommy!

34:31.527 --> 34:34.235
Board up the windows? Are you
sure we're going to be all right?

34:34.322 --> 34:37.360
There are more of them things out there.
More of them things like Uncle Rege.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.359
Tommy!
Go on. Do what I tell ya!

34:45.083 --> 34:50.123
I shut this door, I'm not openin' it until
somebody comes who can get us out of here.

34:50.213 --> 34:54.252
If somebody like that comes,
we'll try to remember to call you.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.676
Idiots! You lamebrains!

34:59.806 --> 35:01.467
You're going to die up here.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.558
You're going to die.

35:17.907 --> 35:21.946
You're going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.029
Daddy's found someone,
and we're going to get some help.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.659
What's happening? They
decided to stay upstairs.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.537
What about us?
it's safer down here.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.045
- What about Sarah?
- It's safer down here, Helen.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.968
There's just that one hammer.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.222
Here. Use this.
Nail 'em up quick and dirty.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.974
Get the windows covered
as fast as you can.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.306
We'll go around later
and reinforce them.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.358
Anybody find any keys,
hang on to 'em.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.605
How many people are up there?
There's two more.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.656
- And they've got the gun.
- No, they've got two guns.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.656
They might have a hundred
guns, for all I know.

36:04.746 --> 36:09.035
But it doesn't matter,
because it's safer down here!

36:09.125 --> 36:11.537
We're going up.
We've got to get help for Sarah.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.744
I'm not opening that door,
Helen, and neither are you.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.839
And if you try, so help me I'll kill you.
You'll what?

36:17.926 --> 36:20.543
That is your daughter lying there.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.753
We have got to
get her to a doctor!

36:22.847 --> 36:24.758
There's no doctors
upstairs, Helen.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.887
And there's
no way out of here!

36:29.104 --> 36:32.187
None of those yo-yos has a car!

36:32.273 --> 36:35.937
What a place to be stuck!

36:36.027 --> 36:38.985
Middle of nowhere.
Bunch of yo-yos.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.154
Judy Rose, help me here!

36:41.282 --> 36:45.241
That's it. Grab this. Perfect.
Fever's gotten worse.

36:46.746 --> 36:50.159
Look, she's going
to be all right.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.787
Somebody'll come.
We'll get out of here.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.837
We're all going to be all right.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.005
Did you find anything?

36:59.134 --> 37:01.626
I'm done over here.
They're crazy.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.802
They're out of their minds.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.175
You bunch of yo-yos!

37:15.150 --> 37:19.815
This is the last of the big stuff, huh?
Not going to do it.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.487
Hey, Tom, give me a hand.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.410
Turn it over.
Come on. Come on.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.872
Get the legs off. Shit!

37:42.010 --> 37:43.763
All right. We'll leave our gun here.

37:43.789 --> 37:45.778
I'll be back.
Come on, come on, come on!

37:45.847 --> 37:47.838
Get over here.

37:52.103 --> 37:55.346
Okay, great.
Bring my gun when you come back.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.024
Come on. Nail it up.

38:04.949 --> 38:08.613
Just get it up.
We'll reinforce it later.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.111
They're so slow!

38:11.706 --> 38:17.167
We could just walk right past 'em.
We wouldn't even have to run.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.120
We could just walk
right past 'em.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.124
We have the guns.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.426
If we're careful,
we can get away.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.471
You told me to fight.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.640
Well, I'm fighting.
I'm not panicking.

38:32.727 --> 38:36.641
This place is not safe,
not upstairs or down.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.895
We should leave
before it's too late.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.022
Look, I know you want
to get out of here,

38:43.112 --> 38:46.070
and so do I,
and we're going to do it.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.320
We're going to figure out a way to
get to that gas, and we'll be gone.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.027
Now, you're doin' fine, all right?
I'm doin' fine.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.283
We're all doin' just fine.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.036
We're going to make it,
if we're careful.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.118
Like you said,
we've got to be careful.

39:00.255 --> 39:04.499
Get them doors down and nail 'em up!
That's it! Nice goin'!

39:06.052 --> 39:08.840
Is she crazy or what?

39:13.226 --> 39:15.934
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.387
Tommy!
Easy- Easy.

39:20.275 --> 39:24.564
Wait for Tom. Wait.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.645
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
All right. Nail it up.

39:26.781 --> 39:30.194
Nail it up! Come on. Come on.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.196
Just get a few nails in.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.198
Okay. Get some in the table top.
All right?

40:23.838 --> 40:28.628
It's all right. Come on.
Keep nailing. Keep pounding.

40:28.718 --> 40:32.302
Get a hole for that one. Come on, Tom.
Tom! Oh, yeah, another door.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.303
Let's get this baby off.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.602
That's good.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.146
Easy, easy, easy.
All right.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.553
Hit it.
Come on!

41:17.058 --> 41:19.641
Hey, we're goin'
upstairs for a minute.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.014
We're going to leave
the weapons here, all right?

41:24.941 --> 41:28.229
Hey, hey, Tom. Tom.
Wait a minute.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.538
Wait a minute.
Don't go up.

41:53.636 --> 41:57.971
It's all right.
Come on. Don't look at it.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.579
What is this?
All new stuff in here?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.630
Uncle Rege was
fixin' up the place.

42:33.092 --> 42:35.299
- No good.
- it's better than nothin', Ben.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.383
No good.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.147
Hey, Tom.
Television.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.979
Check it out and see
if anything's on.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.038
Tellin' you what to do,
I think.

43:15.635 --> 43:19.253
Damn. This must really be big.

43:22.350 --> 43:26.344
Station's in Zelienople.
it's only about 20 miles from here.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.099
Might as well be a hundred.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.608
- Says they're going to come on live.
- Yeah? Well, we can't wait.

43:37.698 --> 43:39.860
Give me a hand with some
of that lumber over there.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.740
We can use some of this stuff
to cover the windows downstairs.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.115
I'm some kind of stupid.
What?

43:49.210 --> 43:52.669
Them old doors, the ones we took
down, they're all in the cellar.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.048
Heads up down there!

44:06.769 --> 44:08.806
- Idiots!
- What's happening up there?

44:08.896 --> 44:12.981
How do I know what's
happening up there?

44:13.067 --> 44:15.525
Said they were going
to board it up.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.694
- Board it up, please.
- And you refused to help them.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.738
That's right, Helen.
I refused.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.738
Right! I refused.
You know why?

44:23.828 --> 44:25.990
Because they're wrong.
it's a stupid idea.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.913
The cellar is the only
safe place in the house.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.991
You watch.
You just watch.

44:31.085 --> 44:35.454
They're going to come begging for us to let
them in down here before this is all over.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.835
And what will you do then?

44:37.925 --> 44:41.293
- Will you open the door then?
- Mr. Cooper?

44:41.429 --> 44:44.012
Harry.

44:44.098 --> 44:47.557
Mr. Cooper, we need the doors that's down
there so we can board up the windows.

44:47.643 --> 44:52.763
- For God's sakes, Harry!
- Then fuck him!

44:52.857 --> 44:55.098
Mr. Cooper,
can you hear me?

44:56.277 --> 44:59.190
Cooper! You open
this door right now!

44:59.280 --> 45:02.523
We need those doors,
Cooper!

45:05.661 --> 45:11.031
I got a shotgun out here. Open this door,
motherfucker, or I'll blow it to shit!

45:11.125 --> 45:13.742
What are you doing? Cooper
Open this door, now!

45:13.878 --> 45:16.745
What do you hope to accomplish?
Shut up, Helen!

45:16.839 --> 45:20.377
I'm counting to three,
then I'm coming through.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.379
We're going to open!

45:26.849 --> 45:29.682
I'm counting.
That's one-

45:36.859 --> 45:40.352
What you going to do, Cooper?
That's two!

45:40.446 --> 45:43.313
Better open this door
right now, Cooper!

46:02.176 --> 46:03.632
Get your hands off of me.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.087
Look. From now on,
you leave that door open!

46:07.181 --> 46:10.424
We may want to get down there. We may need
to get down there if those things break in.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.476
Yeah, sure. You want
the best of both worlds.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.849
You get caged in up here, you want
to be able to run downstairs.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.022
That's not the way
it's workin', pal.

46:18.109 --> 46:21.272
You want to get in that cellar, you get
in there now or you can forget it!

46:21.362 --> 46:24.855
I'm not boxin' myself in down there until
there's absolutely no other choice.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.281
And I'm not gamblin'
with my daughter's life!

46:27.368 --> 46:31.987
You want to stay up here, that's your
decision, but don't count on me to help you.

46:32.081 --> 46:35.290
Look, I am not counting on you for shit.
That's why I'm not going to let you-

46:35.376 --> 46:37.834
If you're going to keep on
fighting, then get out!

46:37.920 --> 46:40.213
This is our house.
This is Tommy's house.

46:40.239 --> 46:42.530
You're just all playin'
rooster with it.

46:42.591 --> 46:46.835
I'd like to know where you'd all
be if we didn't let you in here.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.546
Where would you be
if we kicked you the hell out?

46:49.640 --> 46:53.224
We're not going to kick anyone out, Judy Rose.
We're not going to do anything like that.

46:53.311 --> 46:57.270
Now, come on. Let's try to work together
and get some of this damn shit done!

47:24.508 --> 47:26.340
You ought to keep her covered.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.760
Get some blankets
from upstairs or somethin'.

48:01.462 --> 48:03.419
How'd she get hurt?

48:03.506 --> 48:06.874
One of those people
bit her on the arm.

48:17.561 --> 48:21.270
What? You want
this one too?

48:27.655 --> 48:33.446
We have to get help.
We have to get a doctor for Sarah.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.903
We're going to try.

48:35.996 --> 48:40.661
Since you ain't doin' nothin', maybe you
want to start lookin' for those keys.

48:44.171 --> 48:48.506
What keys? Keys to the
gas pump out back.

48:48.634 --> 48:52.093
You mean, there's a car?
It's a truck!

48:52.179 --> 48:54.637
The gas pump
is locked.

48:54.723 --> 48:57.010
The keys could
be anywhere!

49:03.274 --> 49:07.017
You know where- keys- I'm-

49:07.111 --> 49:10.194
I'm looking for-
Oh, my God.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.865
Oh, my God.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.194
Oh, my God.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.724
I need the hammer in here.

49:43.939 --> 49:46.021
Bring the hammer-

49:57.077 --> 50:00.035
Tommy!

50:10.508 --> 50:14.547
Tommy!
Tommy!

50:14.637 --> 50:18.255
Helen, we ought
to get downstairs quickly!

50:24.939 --> 50:26.725
Damn.

50:28.484 --> 50:32.523
Cooper, get me them nails
over there and that wrench!

50:32.613 --> 50:33.237
Helen!

50:33.263 --> 50:35.756
I can't let go.
You got to help me out.

50:35.866 --> 50:39.029
Get me the wrench and nails, man!
Helen!

50:39.119 --> 50:40.530
Cooper!

50:54.426 --> 50:57.964
This is definitely not going to work.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.977
We've got to get
downstairs quickly.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.820
Take your hands off of me.
Take your hands-

51:08.846 --> 51:10.002
Take your hands off of me!

51:10.067 --> 51:11.978
Damn it!

51:21.620 --> 51:24.078
No!

51:24.164 --> 51:28.749
No, don't shoot it.
It's Mr. Magruder from the Legion Hall.

51:28.836 --> 51:30.608
You shot Mr. Magruder!

51:30.634 --> 51:33.856
Look at his back.
- You shot him!

51:33.924 --> 51:36.962
Look at his back. I didn't do that.
Look there.

51:37.052 --> 51:40.386
Barbara.

51:40.472 --> 51:43.009
Just like Uncle Rege. They're dead,
but they're coming right for us.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.263
No. That's impossible.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.936
That just can't be.

51:49.023 --> 51:52.186
Grab him. We'll throw him
up and out the window.

52:02.202 --> 52:03.317
Is he dead?

52:05.372 --> 52:09.616
Is he dead? You're all seeing this.
Is he dead?

52:09.710 --> 52:12.748
Stop it! You're losing it, girl.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.956
You are losing it!

52:16.050 --> 52:17.961
You think so?

52:23.349 --> 52:25.465
Whatever I lost,
I lost along time ago.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.550
And I do not plan on
losing anything else.

52:27.645 --> 52:30.387
You can talk
to me about losing it...

52:30.481 --> 52:34.190
when you stop screaming at each other
like a bunch of two-year-olds.

52:45.913 --> 52:48.496
You all right?
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.493
You all right?
Look at me.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.996
It's going to be all right, okay?

52:53.087 --> 52:55.704
How many bullets
does this thing hold?

52:55.798 --> 52:58.756
Fifteen. There's more in the desk.

53:03.931 --> 53:06.673
Look, we have a few more
windows to cover up, all right?

53:06.767 --> 53:09.099
Why don't you grab some of that
lumber over there and get started.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.765
It's going to take us a while.
Okay?

53:15.109 --> 53:17.897
Tommy. Tommy.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.604
<i>Hospitals are deluged</i>

54:03.699 --> 54:10.071
<i>Random acts of violence are being committed
by people in a trance-like or hypnotic state.</i>

54:10.164 --> 54:14.203
<i>They've lost their ability to communicate
and reason, and they do not respond...</i>

54:14.293 --> 54:16.625
<i>to command or authority.</i>

54:16.712 --> 54:20.671
<i>Civil forces and the military have been
mobilized but the violence is so widespread...</i>

54:20.758 --> 54:25.093
<i>that it is impossible for rescue
services to respond with any efficiency.</i>

54:25.179 --> 54:28.843
<i>People left to defend themselves are
caught in a river of...</i>

54:38.233 --> 54:41.521
<i>Citizens faced with the collapse of
local police and fire departments...</i>

54:41.612 --> 54:44.104
<i>have taken the law
into their own hands.</i>

54:44.198 --> 54:47.190
<i>Civil and social services have
been disrupted or suspended</i>

54:47.284 --> 54:49.241
<i>Most communities
are without telephones.</i>

54:49.328 --> 54:53.822
<i>Many are without power,"
some are without gas and water</i>

54:53.916 --> 54:56.783
<i>The scientific community
is focusing on the phenomenon.</i>

54:56.877 --> 55:02.293
<i>Specifically, on that trance-like state
that seems to characterize the assailants-</i>

55:02.382 --> 55:05.545
<i>clearly a behavioral disorder.
But what could have caused...</i>

55:05.636 --> 55:09.470
<i>so widespread and dramatic a condition
as the one we are facing tonight?</i>

55:09.556 --> 55:13.515
<i>We've heard speculation on everything from
the ozone layer and chemical weapons...</i>

55:13.602 --> 55:16.264
<i>to, uh,</i>

55:16.355 --> 55:20.474
<i>voodoo, mysticism and organisms from space.</i>

55:20.567 --> 55:23.104
<i>Biologists in Stockton, California,
have released a report...</i>

55:23.195 --> 55:25.311
<i>stating that the, uh,</i>

55:25.405 --> 55:28.989
<i>bodies of
the recently dead are...</i>

55:29.076 --> 55:30.908
<i>returning to life,</i>

55:33.163 --> 55:37.157
<i>driven by an unknown force that enables
the brain to continue to function.</i>

55:40.546 --> 55:46.167
<i>Doctors at the Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta reject that theory,</i>

55:46.260 --> 55:48.877
<i>calling it "preposterous
beyond belief"</i>

55:48.971 --> 55:52.009
<i>They feel that the only
reasonable explanation...</i>

55:52.099 --> 55:54.716
<i>is a germ- uh, a bacteria
or a virus that has...</i>

55:54.810 --> 55:57.518
<i>a mind-altering effect
on its victims,</i>

55:57.604 --> 56:01.017
<i>though how such a germ could have
been delivered so quickly...</i>

56:01.108 --> 56:04.442
<i>and over such a vast area
does remain a mystery.</i>

56:04.528 --> 56:08.271
<i>It's being called "Judgment Day"
by religious lea-</i>

56:52.326 --> 56:55.489
Hey, man. Where you takin' that? Huh?
What the hell-

56:55.621 --> 56:58.363
That stays up there, pal. Will
you get off my back, Goddamn it!

56:58.498 --> 57:01.035
Damn it!

57:02.586 --> 57:05.328
Damn it! Nice going, asshole!
You smashed it!

57:05.464 --> 57:08.252
You were taking it downstairs!
I was not!

57:08.383 --> 57:11.171
You stupid-
You fuck-

57:12.638 --> 57:15.050
Damn you!
I'll kill you.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.139
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

57:17.225 --> 57:20.434
That was our only way
of finding out what was going on,

57:20.520 --> 57:23.012
and you smashed it!

57:23.106 --> 57:25.768
I wasn't taking it downstairs!

57:25.859 --> 57:29.693
You can't get any reception
in a basement, dickhead!

57:32.282 --> 57:34.148
What the hell
is she doin'? Hey!

57:43.043 --> 57:45.034
Is that your Uncle Rege?
Looks like him.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.665
Do you think he might have
a set of keys in his pocket?

58:04.898 --> 58:08.562
We've got to get the keys.
Damn it, stay back here!

58:36.596 --> 58:38.086
We can get away.

58:39.391 --> 58:41.678
No, it's too dangerous.

58:41.768 --> 58:44.009
I'm telling you,
we could make it!

58:44.104 --> 58:46.766
Five miles. We got that kid.
Cooper's kid.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.474
- Leave him. We'll bring help.
- We better make some kind of damn move.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.067
We're drawing a crowd here.

59:01.329 --> 59:03.286
You know I'm right.

59:03.373 --> 59:07.037
Like I told you,
we can walk right by them.

59:07.127 --> 59:10.461
I got 'em. I got the keys.

59:12.340 --> 59:15.708
We got to get to the gas.
It's our best chance.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.464
All right. Everybody,
back inside quick!

59:24.478 --> 59:26.515
Damn it! Get in here!

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.563
I want you to stay inside. What?

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.978
Keep the rifle. You can't
go out without the guns.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.982
We have Tom's gun. If something
happens, I want that rifle in here.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:21.111
- I don't want any locked doors between me and this guy.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:21.899
Do you think that-

01:00:21.925 --> 01:00:23.843
- Shut up, Cooper.
I don't want to hear another word.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:27.371
The only way I'm going out there is with
you and that rifle keepin' things straight.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.289
Tom, let's go.
it's you and me.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.036
I'm coming with you.
I can drive.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.083
No, you're staying here.
Somebody's gotta drive,

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.506
somebody's got to do the gas, and
somebody's gotta ride shotgun.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:43.759
That means three of us goes out. Tommy,
tell them I know how to drive. I can do it!

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:46.341
Her daddy's got trucks. She's been
driving since she was little.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.894
All right. Is that shotgun loaded?

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.847
Yeah, I got shells in my pocket.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:58.985
Can't tell how many
are on the porch.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.029
Probably be the toughest
getting past those.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:04.154
Once we get to the yard, we oughta be all right.
Not too many out there.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.825
There's no way.
This is crazy.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.534
We're never going
to make it.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.993
Hah!

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.558
You keep an eye
on us outside.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.766
When we get that gas and start driving
back, get that kid up there fast.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.726
Judy, get in that truck, all right?

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.312
Get in; get it started.
Don't stop, no matter what happens.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:43.898
Tom and I will keep those things off of you.
You just move!

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.781
Heads up!

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.499
Go! Come on!
Get in the truck!

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.797
Get in!

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:13.052
No! Oh, God!

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.137
Oh, God!

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.573
Damn it!

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:02.192
Shut the door!
Shut the door!

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.271
Darn you piece of shit!
Start!

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.599
Come on! Come on! Wait! Wait!

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.053
Ben, come on!

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.557
What's happening?

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.900
Ben!

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.326
Judy Rose, slow down!
We lost Ben!

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:57.748
Judy Rose, stop!
Stop the car!

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.075
We lost Ben!
Go back!

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.081
Judy!

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.873
Ben!

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.385
We lost Ben!
What?

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.178
We lost Ben! Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.557
I was hollering at you!
Go back and pick him up!

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:28.362
Tommy, here he comes! What should I do?
I don't wanna leave you!

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.440
Go down there
and get him, Judy Rose!

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.986
- These are the wrong keys!
- What?

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:39.581
These are the wrong damn keys!

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.375
Tom! What the hell
are you doing?

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.393
I want you down
in that cellar, Helen!

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.771
There's nothing more we can do up here.
Not now.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.444
Do what he says. We're
gonna try to get to town.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:13.195
At least I am. I f I can find
any help, I'll be back.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.195
Come on.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.118
We mustn't leave Ben!

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:33.802
But we should wait until Ben gets back.
I'll wait as long as I can.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.004
Right now, I want you in
that cellar where it's safe.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:39.679
But maybe we should-
Into the cellar, Helen. Now.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.262
Your daughter needs you.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:18.838
Sarah?

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.234
Oh, my baby!

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.749
I want that gun.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.381
God. You go to hell.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.179
I want that gun. Give it up, Cooper!
just crawl back into-

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:08.351
Help me! No!

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.024
Cooper! Cooper!

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.317
Open this door,
Goddamn it!

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:19.032
Son of a bitch, Cooper!

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:22.782
Open it up!
Cooper!

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:34.381
Cooper! Open this door!

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.755
Goddamn it!

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:45.392
Barbara!
Give that to me!

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.347
Cooper! Son of a bitch!

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.901
Let me in!
Let me in!

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.275
Cooper!

01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:00.778
Open the door!

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:06.363
Cooper!
Let me in!

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.341
Cooper!

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.853
- Go on! Push!
- I'm trying!

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.649
Push!

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.205
Let him in!
Let him in!

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:54.622
The gun! Get his gun!

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.191
S-Sarah?

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.069
Shoot it.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.532
No.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.990
Shoot it, Cooper.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.993
No, I-
Shoot it, Cooper.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.416
But... it's my-

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.835
No!

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.510
Ohh.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:06.783
Stop it! Ben, are you crazy?
Stop it!

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.577
Cooper, no!
Cooper!

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:17.411
No! God!

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.215
Madness.

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.286
They're coming.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.742
No.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.291
- We can still make it.
- No, I can't.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.163
I'm hurt bad.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.961
Go on.
Get out of here. Go!

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.634
I'll bring help if I can.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:07.836
Go!

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.156
Oh, God!

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.491
<i>Do not attempt
to reach friends or family</i>

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.043
<i>Do not attempt to reach
any of the rescue stations...</i>

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:35.212
<i>identified in previous advisories.</i>

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.916
<i>They may no longer be in operation.</i>

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:41.799
<i>Repeating this advisory number nine from
the Office of Emergency Preparedness...</i>

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.507
<i>dated 11:00 p.m. August 23, 1989.</i>

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.719
<i>It has been confirmed
that the bodies of the dead...</i>

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:52.101
<i>are being reactivated
by forces as yet unknown.</i>

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.432
Got that right.

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:58.111
<i>These reactivated
bodies are weak and uncoordinated</i>

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.532
<i>but are capable of inflicting
damage on people and on property.</i>

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.906
<i>They are to be considered
extremely dangerous,</i>

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:09.114
<i>especially when encountered
in large numbers.</i>

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:13.247
<i>These bodies can be disposed of
in only one known manner-</i>

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.578
<i>that is by incapacitating the brain.</i>

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.630
They got that right too.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.003
<i>These reactivated bodies...</i>

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.462
<i>will attack warm-blooded animals
of all species,</i>

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:27.265
<i>including human beings,
without pro vocation,</i>

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.931
<i>and will devour flesh of any prey.</i>

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:35.185
<i>It's been confirmed that acts
of homicide and cannibalism...</i>

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:37.979
<i>reported through the afternoon and evening...</i>

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.186
<i>of August 23, 1989...</i>

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:42.989
<i>are attributable,
at least in part,</i>

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.487
<i>to these reactivated bodies.</i>

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:27.366
Don't shoot!

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.990
Don't shoot!

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.955
Johnnie!

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:52.384
Jesus Goddamn holy-lovin' shit!

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.061
What in the name
of Jupiter's balls...

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:57.889
are you doin' out here
alone, little lady?

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.135
...they're hangin' out down there.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.839
'Cause me and the boys
must have dragged out...

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:15.721
at least seven, eight
of them down there already.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.271
Very interesting. Tell me,
Chief, are these things slow-moving?

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:22.564
Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.393
Ward, puttin' on a little
extra weight, aren't you, buddy?

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:50.252
They're us.
We're them, and they're us.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:53.508
Say what?

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:57.053
Nothing.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:21:00.682
No more
beer for you, man!

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:04.687
- Having fun?
- Give me a break.

01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:55.384
Whoa.
Drag that outta here.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.213
I'm goin' in there. Watch your back.
There may be more of 'em.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.797
All right.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:11.810
Oh!

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:15.067
You came back.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.032
You came back.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:30.085
There's another one for the fire.
