WEBVTT

00:16.850 --> 00:19.227
Well, that's just... that's uncomfortable.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.187
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.605
"What's up?"

00:23.189 --> 00:25.984
Tell us what happened.
Did we win? Did we lose?

00:26.067 --> 00:27.527
Is humanity saved forever?

00:27.610 --> 00:30.196
And did you find my Nintendo?
I can't find it any... Whoop!

00:30.697 --> 00:32.198
Never mind. I'm holding it.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.617
Sorry. I can't reveal the results
of the experiment

00:34.701 --> 00:35.910
until we get to the Judge's chambers.

00:35.994 --> 00:36.995
Okay. Where is everyone?

00:37.078 --> 00:39.122
Where's Simone, and John and Brent,

00:39.205 --> 00:41.583
and actually I don't care about
any of those doofs. Where's Chidi?

00:41.666 --> 00:42.834
Oh, he's on the toilet.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.420
Sorry, that's not enough information.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.589
The test subjects are frozen in stasis,

00:47.672 --> 00:51.843
so I put them in the bathroom
and I placed Chidi on the toilet.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.178
The best seat.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.179
Let's wake him up.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.348
You know, so I can, like,
be reunited with the man I love?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.142
Snappy, snappy, memory fixxy?

00:59.225 --> 01:02.228
The Judge says no one gets unfrozen
until she's ruled on the case.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.649
Oh, uh, humans have to stay here.
You can't see the numbers.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.445
Hang on. I worked my ash off
running this neighborhood for a full year,

01:10.528 --> 01:12.864
and I'm not even allowed
to hear how we did?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.157
Yes.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.492
And here's a bottle of tequila.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.911
Okay, let us know how it goes.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.671
Regardless of what the Judge rules,
this feels like some sort of goodbye.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.883
Even if we succeeded, there's
no guarantee she'll keep us together.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.176
She might just snap her fingers

01:33.259 --> 01:35.929
and send us flying
into different dimensions.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.723
How was that? Did I cheer everyone up?

01:38.807 --> 01:42.602
Oh, man, are we gonna die again?
We've died so many times.

01:42.685 --> 01:46.356
We've probably had, like,
15 funerals by now.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.857
It's getting annoying.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.694
If it would cheer you up, I could tell you
what happened at your original funerals.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.614
Tahani, Moby spoke first.
He claimed that--

01:54.697 --> 01:57.367
Please stop. I don't want to hear it.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.451
What about mine?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.787
Your friends didn't say things about you,

02:00.870 --> 02:03.581
so much as they graffitied
a Red Lobster about you.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.126
Yeah, in Jacksonville,
that's the first stage of grief.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.546
In Arizona, you can either have
a regular funeral,

02:09.629 --> 02:12.340
or they can put your body out
on a shooting range,

02:12.423 --> 02:14.759
and you get a $200 state tax credit.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.638
Hang on. This is how we take our minds
off the Judge's ruling.

02:18.721 --> 02:22.767
Let's throw ourselves the funeral
to end all funerals.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.810
Awesome!

02:23.893 --> 02:25.395
And you know what they say in Florida,

02:25.478 --> 02:28.857
"If you don't like this funeral,
just wait a minute."

02:32.277 --> 02:35.363
Ugh, the Judge's chambers?
I hate this place.

02:35.446 --> 02:39.284
What's the Wi-Fi password?
There is no service.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.578
Shawn.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.998
-Michael.
-Bounces off me and sticks to you.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.958
Wait, no, I messed that up.

02:47.041 --> 02:51.796
First, say something mean to me,
really cruel, something that just guts me.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.715
You're totally going to be glue.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.550
So, it's come to this.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.471
We have finally arrived at the end of your
pathetic attempt to prove that humans

03:00.555 --> 03:03.933
are more than just mobile turd factories.

03:04.017 --> 03:09.022
And you are going to fail, again,
because that is what you do.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.024
You're a choker, Michael.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.192
And you're about to choke
for the last time.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.154
Except for the eternity
you're going to spend in the Bad Place,

03:16.237 --> 03:19.407
being choked by me,
who will be doing the choking.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.118
Well, you're glue.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.038
-Wow!

03:25.121 --> 03:26.289
- Beautiful!
- Look at this place!

03:26.372 --> 03:27.248
- Amazing!

03:27.332 --> 03:28.166
The floor!

03:28.249 --> 03:30.168
Hello, Good Place Committee.
Thank you for coming.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.669
No, thank you, Michael.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.338
You did an incredible job,

03:33.421 --> 03:34.964
maybe the best job that anyone's ever done

03:35.048 --> 03:35.924
-at any task.
-Mmm.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.800
But you don't know how we did.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.721
We might not know how you did,
but we know you did great.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.265
And, Shawn, before we even
find out what happened,

03:44.349 --> 03:46.559
we want you to know we're willing
to give up all of our leverage,

03:46.643 --> 03:48.686
-compromise and meet you halfway.
-Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.313
I met your mom halfway last night.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.856
-So colorful!

03:53.316 --> 03:57.237
We are here to celebrate
the afterlife of Tahani Al-Jamil,

03:57.320 --> 03:59.697
in the place she felt most comfortable,

03:59.781 --> 04:03.576
the cabin of
a Gulfstream G650 private jet.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.745
Tahani was super nice,

04:05.828 --> 04:09.374
and she deserved for people
to be nicer to her than they were.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.087
The only sad thing is that she never
got over her speech impediment.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.049
Tahani improved so much
over her many lives,

04:18.132 --> 04:20.468
but she also helped me improve.

04:20.551 --> 04:24.973
She taught me lots of stuff,
like "Bras shouldn't be painful,"

04:25.056 --> 04:28.017
and, "You don't buy bras at Home Depot,"

04:28.101 --> 04:31.145
and "They don't sell bras at Home Depot.
What the hell are you wearing?"

04:31.896 --> 04:35.692
For the record, it was a men's back
support harness, and it worked in a pinch.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.655
She was the best friend I ever had...
and I loved her.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.450
Thank you so much. That was wonderful.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.452
I wish Chidi was here.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.414
It sucks that he's too dead
for these heaven funerals.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.917
Can someone grab his arm?
My hands are kind of full with his butt.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.336
How'd he get so jacked?

04:55.420 --> 04:59.048
When he was 14, someone told him
that exercise alleviated anxiety.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.801
He started doing push-ups
and basically never stopped.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.723
All right, everyone, let's get this done.

05:06.806 --> 05:11.060
This is the single most important case
that has ever appeared in my court,

05:11.144 --> 05:14.480
and the results will have ramifications
for eternity.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.608
Before we begin,
I'm going to need you all to sign this.

05:19.777 --> 05:23.573
"A petition to bring back <i>Ally McBeal"?</i>

05:23.656 --> 05:26.284
Well, yeah. I mean,
everything else is getting rebooted.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.661
Get a young hottie in there,
like a Zendaya type?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.121
Is it Zenday-ah or Zend-iyah?

05:30.204 --> 05:32.582
Zenday-ah. Or, I don't...

05:32.665 --> 05:35.626
I mean, who wouldn't watch that?
Am I right? Anyone?

05:35.710 --> 05:36.878
Oh, fine.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.547
Take it away, Matt.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.925
Okay, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.471
The test results that dictate
the future of humanity.

05:47.055 --> 05:47.930
Here we go.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.516
-In 30, 29...
-Ahem.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.312
...two, one, <i>voilà!</i>

05:55.897 --> 05:57.023
I thought this would be fun.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.025
Had a lot of time alone in there.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.194
Bam!

06:02.111 --> 06:05.281
Simone got 12% better
than she was on Earth.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.992
Bam! Chidi got 26% better.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.495
Bam! John got 44% better.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.416
Shoot.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.795
Shouldn't have committed so hard
to this "bam" thing.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.048
Funeral!

06:23.633 --> 06:28.054
Jason, at the risk of getting an answer
that might thoroughly depress me,

06:28.137 --> 06:29.472
what made you choose this setting?

06:29.555 --> 06:32.809
There's a Jacksonville tradition of having
your funeral where you were born.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.063
I got born in the deep end of a pool,
right after my mom did a cannonball.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.815
Well, I knew the risks.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.274
You never really talk about your mom.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.151
Yeah, she died when I was pretty young.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.654
I lost her to the Big C.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.449
That's what we called the crocodile
that lived by my house.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.745
I'm just playing, it was cancer.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.455
Watch me do a handstand.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.128
Jason Mendoza
didn't have an easy life.

07:00.211 --> 07:04.590
He once told me the closest he'd ever
gotten to having a piñata on his birthday

07:04.674 --> 07:07.468
was when a seagull ate too many condoms
on the beach and exploded.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.848
But despite it all, he was
the most optimistic person I'd ever met.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.934
Jason was the very first person
to ask me about my feelings.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.812
I hadn't had any yet,
but it made me wanna go get some.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.858
I could see something special inside him
that no one else could see.

07:22.358 --> 07:26.154
It was a multi-colored blob of positivity
right behind his sternum.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.530
That's my Jason,

07:27.613 --> 07:32.618
a big, colorful, rainbow blob, stuffed
inside a hot life-size action figure.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.914
Plus, I gotta say, it was nice
to have a true dirtbag buddy,

07:36.998 --> 07:39.500
so I could talk about
what really mattered in life:

07:39.584 --> 07:42.962
wrestling, semi-legal drugs
and Jason Statham.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.505
Statham forever!

07:44.589 --> 07:45.506
Indeed.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.216
Statham forever.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.634
Amen.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.635
Amen.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.180
Let's focus on the big picture here.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.767
Free of Earth's complications,
and its unintended consequences,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.895
the other three improved a lot.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.772
Chidi got 38% more confident.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.860
Simone got 43%
more flexible in her judgments of people,

08:05.943 --> 08:08.613
and John didn't call
one single person the C-word.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.532
But he did yell the C-word at himself,

08:11.616 --> 08:15.244
as well as a pack of squirrels
and a chair he tripped over.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.414
Why are we even still discussing this?
Brent got worse.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.750
If humans can't be good
with their needs magically met,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.460
maybe they're just not that good.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.421
He's right.
The evidence needed to be overwhelming.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.007
I can't just turn
the whole afterlife upside down

08:28.090 --> 08:30.551
because three people
got a little bit better.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.096
But don't forget, there's a lot of
evidence that Eleanor, Jason and Tahani

08:34.180 --> 08:38.059
got better in the original experiment,
so that's six people.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.936
That's the number of friends in <i>Friends.</i>

08:40.019 --> 08:43.397
Are you gonna sit there and say
that every single Friend belongs in hell?

08:43.481 --> 08:48.027
I mean, maybe Ross and Rachel...
and Monica and Joey...

08:48.110 --> 08:49.654
and definitely Chandler...

08:51.072 --> 08:52.198
but Phoebe?

08:52.281 --> 08:54.408
Face it, Michael, you lost.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.079
Everything you've done, this experiment,
the original neighborhood,

08:58.162 --> 09:00.873
sending your little cockroach buddies
back to Earth, all of it was for nothing.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.000
Bam! You're glue.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.046
Actually, Shawn,
that's a very interesting point.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.214
Exactly. What?

09:08.297 --> 09:11.717
Matt, call up the active files
of four people still alive on Earth.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.513
Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop,
and her step-daughter, Patricia,

09:15.596 --> 09:17.932
and Steven Peleaz, aka Pillboi.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.183
They were not part of the experiment.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.143
If he gets to bring
random good people into it,

09:21.227 --> 09:22.812
I should be able to bring in
random bad people.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.774
Call up Elizabeth Holmes.
No, Henry Kissinger. No...

09:27.692 --> 09:28.526
PewDiePie.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.571
Your Honor, the people I wanna look at
are not random.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.615
They're four humans the "cockroaches"
helped on Earth.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.993
No magic, just kindness.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.247
And I bet their emotional support
made those four people better.

09:41.330 --> 09:46.377
And if I'm wrong,
I'll be the first to say... "We're glue."

09:46.460 --> 09:48.879
I don't think any of you
is using that right.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.131
But, fine, let's see it.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.009
Look! Right there.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.013
After we intervened, Pillboi dedicated
himself to caring for the elderly.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.182
Kamilah started a scholarship
in Tahani's name

10:00.266 --> 10:02.935
that sent 213 women to college.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.272
Donna started doing homework
with Patricia every night,

10:06.355 --> 10:11.027
and that little girl actually ended up
teaching Donna multiplication.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.236
Yikes.

10:12.320 --> 10:17.575
Look, the point is people improve
when they get external love and support.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.162
How can we hold it against them
when they don't?

10:21.245 --> 10:26.125
Need I remind you that Brent got worse
every second of every moment of every day.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.502
Until right at the end.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.339
With ten seconds left, he swung way up.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.217
This is it, Your Honor.
This is the whole story.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.597
No one is beyond rehabilitation.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.434
Brent spent a year being
an absolute diaper load of a human being

10:43.517 --> 10:45.061
and the points total tells you that.

10:45.144 --> 10:51.400
But what that number can't tell you...
is who he could've become tomorrow.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.447
I'll have my ruling shortly.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.784
Okay, Janet, where do you wanna go
for your funeral?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.077
Dave & Buster's, probably?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.787
You probably want to go
to Dave & Buster's.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.748
I think I heard her say "Dave & Buster's,"
so let's just go there.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.999
We can sort it out later.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.505
It's nice that you want to honor me,
but you've already given me so much.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.966
Tahani taught me
that you can make a family,

11:16.050 --> 11:17.510
even if you never really had one.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.430
Jason taught me that I have value
beyond what I do for other people.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.935
And, Eleanor, there was a moment on Earth
when all hope was lost,

11:26.018 --> 11:27.937
and I watched you have hope anyway.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.233
Just thinking about that makes me
want to barf up a beautiful quasar.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.110
Well said, Janet.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.529
That means it's your turn, Eleanor.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.907
All right. Mine's easy.
We don't even have to move.

11:39.990 --> 11:44.370
I stand here before you, in sweatpants,
for the first time ever,

11:44.453 --> 11:49.500
to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop in a place
where she spent much of her life,

11:49.583 --> 11:52.253
a bar in a house she was not invited to.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.463
Eleanor was full of surprises.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.550
I never knew if she was going to
ruthlessly make fun of me,

11:57.633 --> 12:02.930
or totally objectify me in a way that was
flattering and also vaguely problematic.

12:03.013 --> 12:03.848
Well...

12:03.931 --> 12:07.101
But whether she was lifting me up
or calling me out...

12:09.270 --> 12:13.774
I never felt quite so seen
as when she saw me.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.904
Eleanor, I know you don't like it
when people get all emotional about you,

12:18.988 --> 12:21.198
so I channeled all of my love for you
into this song.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
That's when the foam cannons go...

12:33.210 --> 12:36.630
Explode outward.
And then back to the song.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.343
-Okay, okay, we're good. Thank you.
-Yeah.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.387
Okay. Who's left?

12:45.681 --> 12:49.810
We are here to celebrate the afterlife
of Chidi Anagonye.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.188
Eleanor, would you like to say
a few words?

12:56.609 --> 13:02.781
Chidi was a... rootin'-tootin',
rackin'-frackin' varmint.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.119
Sorry, I don't know why I just went
full Yosemite Sam there. Um...

13:08.537 --> 13:11.499
Yeah, I don't think I can, uh, do this.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.628
I... I can't sum up all my feelings
about Chidi, so I'm gonna pass.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.717
The Judge is about to make her ruling.
She wants us to be there to hear it.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.345
Oh, we should probably change outfits.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.680
Tahani's sweatpants say
"Skank Army" on the butt.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.140
They do?

13:28.724 --> 13:33.687
Michael... you came to me
and said the points system was flawed.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.650
A system that has been in place
since the dawn of time

13:37.733 --> 13:41.654
and has judged every soul
that has ever walked the Earth.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.031
And I have come to the conclusion...

13:46.575 --> 13:47.826
that you're right.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.579
-I'm...
- You're right.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.666
Humans are not fixed
at one level of morality.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.794
They can always get better,
which means the points system

13:56.877 --> 14:00.422
does not accurately judge
how good or bad they are.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
You won.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.553
Mmm-hmm.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.933
Well, that wasn't so hard now, was it?

14:12.309 --> 14:13.394
We did it!

14:16.772 --> 14:20.234
The universe owes you a debt of gratitude
for bringing this to my attention.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.195
Now, in terms of how we handle this,
moving forward,

14:23.279 --> 14:25.364
obviously, Earth is cancelled.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.367
Uh, Earth is what now?

14:28.450 --> 14:31.912
All humans on Earth and in the afterlife
will be extinguished,

14:31.996 --> 14:35.499
and we will start
the entire human race over from scratch.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.251
And you know what's so funny?

14:37.334 --> 14:42.673
In a very roundabout way,
I am actually rebooting <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

14:42.756 --> 14:44.925
Because I'm rebooting everything.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.929
Anyway, congrats, Michael. You won!

14:52.266 --> 14:53.726
Whoa, whoa.

14:53.809 --> 14:57.688
Your Honor, let's just slow down here
and say everything again maybe,

14:57.771 --> 15:01.317
because I think some of us
were thinking about skateboards

15:01.400 --> 15:03.319
and don't know what's going on.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.114
Canceling Earth,
doesn't that seem a bit drastic?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.075
It's just too much of a mess down there,
you know?

15:10.159 --> 15:14.371
I mean, the simplest solution
is to erase everyone that ever lived

15:14.455 --> 15:18.876
and restart
with a bunch of amoebas or whatever.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.463
Then human life will evolve again,
or maybe even something better.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.840
Maybe this time
they won't have baby teeth.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.010
You know, that whole thing is so weird.
Like, they fall out,

15:28.093 --> 15:32.222
and then the bigger teeth
just grow out of that same hole? Gross.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.684
Anyway, the important thing is, Earth...

15:37.394 --> 15:39.355
How are you guys surprised?

15:39.438 --> 15:41.357
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen if you won?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.360
I don't know,
I thought we could just give three points

15:44.443 --> 15:46.195
for eating an apple instead of two.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.239
Yes, why can't we
just tweak the points a little?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.658
Just a little boost.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.743
-Like Spanx, but for your soul.
-Yes.

15:52.826 --> 15:57.998
Guys, the problem isn't the points,
it's that Earth has become too complicated

15:58.082 --> 16:01.418
for the points to reflect the value
of human behavior.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.046
Remember? The whole thing you discovered?

16:04.129 --> 16:08.008
And now I have no choice but to fix it.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.553
Where did I put
that human-wiper-outer thingy?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.764
-Um...
-Lip gloss, lip gloss,

16:13.847 --> 16:17.059
thing that ends all the wars,
<i>Justified</i> Season 2.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.686
Wow. You won.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.564
And you still somehow failed. Classic.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.695
Wake Chidi up. Now.
We need all the help we can get.

16:27.778 --> 16:32.491
You really want me to wake him up
just to tell him that

16:32.574 --> 16:34.201
he and everyone else in the universe
is going to cease to exist?

16:34.284 --> 16:35.953
Not when you say it like that.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.538
-Well, what...

16:37.621 --> 16:40.791
-The Good Place nerds, our only hope.
-I don't--

16:40.874 --> 16:43.252
Yo, yo, yo, angel-types,
if you are ever going to do something,

16:43.335 --> 16:44.420
you gotta do it now.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.381
Oh, you bet we're gonna do something.
This has gone too far.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.634
I'm composing
some very sternly-worded letters.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.471
Are we sure "stern" is the right tone?
We don't want to seem strident.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.723
-Yeah.
-It upsets the norms.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.016
You're absolutely right.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.060
I apologize and resign,
effective immediately.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.646
So bold. I am so proud of you.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.398
Here it is! Great.

17:04.481 --> 17:09.028
Michael, Shawn, Janet,
see you in maybe a billion years?

17:09.111 --> 17:12.573
It has been one crazy ride, you guys.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.784
<i>♪ I'm gonna miss somebody</i>
<i>I'm gonna miss somebody ♪</i>

17:15.868 --> 17:17.119
<i>♪ I'm gonna miss everybody ♪</i>

17:17.202 --> 17:21.123
<i>♪ And I'm gonna miss every...</i>
<i>See you at the crossroads, crossroads ♪</i>

17:21.206 --> 17:24.543
<i>♪ See you at the crossroads, crossroads ♪</i>

17:24.626 --> 17:27.463
Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.007
Okay. Bye, y'all.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.554
Janet, what the hell? Give it back.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.640
No. It's in my void and you can't have it.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.560
I don't say "no" a lot.
Did I pronounce that right?

17:41.643 --> 17:42.978
Janet, you give me back my thingy,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.897
or I will go into your void
and get it myself.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.106
I'd like to see you try.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.777
Oh. Okay, she's trying right now.
She's in my void.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.654
It feels... it feels weird.
Yeah-- Yikes, whoa.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.031
Okay.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.325
Real cute, honey. Where is it?

17:56.408 --> 17:59.661
-What do you mean? It's not in my void?
- No.

18:00.662 --> 18:01.622
It's in mine.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.209
Ugh, I feel like such a wiener hole
saying this,

18:05.292 --> 18:09.797
but Michael wrote a manifesto,
and I read it on the toilet.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.883
I don't have to poop. I choose to.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.761
Anyway, I'm with them now.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.890
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, get over yourself, you dork.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.309
The whole system is royally effed.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.646
Humans suck, but this isn't their fault.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.273
You read what I wrote?
And it got through to you?

18:28.357 --> 18:32.528
Yeah, but I also used the pages to wipe
my butt, so don't pop a stiffy just yet.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.029
M'kay?

18:34.613 --> 18:37.783
- I am so proud of you.
-I don't care.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.952
I think you do a little bit.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.121
Sister hug!

18:42.204 --> 18:43.747
-Yeah, okay. Get off me. Ew, ew, ew, ew.
- Hey!

18:43.831 --> 18:47.709
Listen up. I made an official ruling
and I am not going to see it undone

18:47.793 --> 18:50.337
by two Janets playing keep-away.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.466
Oh, I should've explained.
It's not two of us.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.301
It's all of us.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.345
-Hi.
- What up, nerds?

18:58.428 --> 18:59.429
Eat my farts, losers.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.640
I am entering for a reason
and no other reason.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.475
- What up, fart-knockers?
- Hi!

19:03.559 --> 19:06.228
- Hello.
-What it is, what it is!

19:06.311 --> 19:07.646
What up, dorks.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.735
Sent the manifesto around
to all the other Janets.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.654
We have a group text now.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.614
I mostly send GIFs of otters!

19:19.283 --> 19:24.037
This is so annoying!

19:24.121 --> 19:27.457
Okay, Janets, you want to do this
the hard way?

19:27.958 --> 19:32.254
I am gonna search your voids one by one,

19:32.838 --> 19:36.800
and then marbleize you one by one,

19:37.426 --> 19:41.722
until I get
my stupid Earth rebooter thingy back.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.601
We're not gonna be able
to hold her off forever. We need a plan.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.980
Okay. So, what's the plan?
Plan, plan, plan.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.399
Step one, get a plan.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.860
Step two, do the plan.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.779
-Yeah, this is working.
-Michael. Focus.

19:57.863 --> 19:58.822
Right. Sorry.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.201
Uh, all right,
so if we can't change the points,

20:02.284 --> 20:05.579
then maybe we can change
what we do with the points.

20:06.163 --> 20:11.001
Yeah, we just need a brand-new system
for judging humans in the afterlife.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.295
-We can do this, right?
-Yeah.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.923
But in order to crack it,
I think you know what needs to happen.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.675
There is literally only one person here

20:18.759 --> 20:23.263
who is smart enough and thoughtful enough
to save humanity.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.892
Fine. I'll do it.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.810
Not you, dummy.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.648
Designing a better afterlife
is the ultimate ethical question.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.693
Chidi spent his entire existence
pondering the biggest questions.

20:36.777 --> 20:40.822
He is brilliant and empathetic.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.867
All he cares about
is how best to treat other people

20:43.951 --> 20:47.162
and he is willing to sacrifice
his own happiness to do it.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.707
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need Chidi back.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.793
And he needs his memories.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.838
You want to take
the most indecisive man ever born,

20:56.922 --> 21:02.052
stuff him full
of over 800 different versions of himself,

21:02.135 --> 21:05.931
and then tell him he has, like,
what, 45 minutes to save humanity?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.850
You think that will go well?

21:08.934 --> 21:12.396
I don't know how it's gonna go,
but he is our only chance.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.815
And it is now or literally never.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.484
Wake him up.

21:18.694 --> 21:22.197
Not in this Janet. Next!
