00:01.724 --> 00:05.034
Previously on "Survivor"

00:05.068 --> 00:09.724
At the karma tribe all eyes were
On the returning players.

00:09.758 --> 00:11.182
They've had their moment to
Shine.

00:11.206 --> 00:12.103
It's our chance.

00:12.137 --> 00:16.448
Joe and I are under a
Magnifying glass.

00:16.482 --> 00:22.000
Another returning
Player was being targeted.

00:22.034 --> 00:23.793
I'm all about blindsiding
Wentworth.

00:23.827 --> 00:25.241
I think that's a great idea.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.931
And chris wanted to
Bring in war dog.

00:27.965 --> 00:31.551
Now would be a really good
Time to make a move on.

00:31.586 --> 00:32.448
Wentworth.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.827
But war dog had his Own agenda.

00:33.862 --> 00:35.034
It's got to be keith.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.344
How is keith in the game
Helping the war dog out?

00:38.379 --> 00:40.482
And the answer is, he is not.

00:40.517 --> 00:42.965
At tribal council,
Keith was voted out.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.862
Keith, the tribe has spoken.

00:45.896 --> 00:48.241
God!

00:48.275 --> 00:51.206
And had a decision to Make.

00:51.241 --> 00:52.758
My god.

00:52.793 --> 00:56.862
Go home or grab the
Torch and go to the edge of.

00:56.896 --> 00:57.310
Extinction.

00:57.344 --> 00:59.137
Come on, god.

00:59.172 --> 01:03.275
Come on.

Aaaah!

01:34.172 --> 01:36.517
Man!

01:36.551 --> 01:37.758
I'm so sorry.

01:37.793 --> 01:38.827
No, dude.

01:38.862 --> 01:39.689
I'm sorry.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.448
Don't be sorry.

01:42.482 --> 01:43.793
This is insane.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.034
This is actually insane.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.344
I'm scared out of my mind.

01:46.379 --> 01:47.103
It's dark.

01:47.137 --> 01:48.034
It's freaking dark.

01:48.068 --> 01:49.562
You literally cannot see in
Front of you.

01:49.586 --> 01:51.344
Keith, it's rough out here.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.310
I'm going to tell you straight
Up.

01:53.344 --> 01:56.482
It's really rough out here.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.689
I haven't eaten in days, man.

01:57.724 --> 01:58.586
Are you serious?

01:58.620 --> 01:59.517
Yes.

01:59.551 --> 02:02.793
I definitely want to get
Sleep tonight.

02:04.137 --> 02:06.448
It's an emotional roller
Coaster out here.

02:06.482 --> 02:12.137
And knowing all of that, I feel
Now responsible for keith.

02:12.172 --> 02:14.517
I definitely want to get some
Food.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.310
There is no food here.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.344
You gotta get it yourself.

02:17.379 --> 02:21.172
I was ready to raise that mast,
But now, I'm in that "Motherly".

02:21.206 --> 02:24.172
Role and I hate to leave him
Alone.

02:24.206 --> 02:32.206
I have to stay to make sure he's
Okay.

02:34.275 --> 02:41.758
I have to stay to make sure he's
Okay.

02:41.793 --> 02:42.689
There's something.

02:42.724 --> 02:43.620
Ing this' up.

02:43.655 --> 02:46.655
There's new things.

02:46.689 --> 02:50.241
My god!

02:50.275 --> 02:52.034
"Keith" and "Reem."

02:52.068 --> 02:57.551
this freaking game, bro.

02:57.586 --> 02:59.586
Wow!

02:59.620 --> 03:00.862
It's a map.

03:00.896 --> 03:03.896
Mast.

03:03.931 --> 03:07.137
Wreck.

03:07.172 --> 03:09.344
Steps?

03:09.379 --> 03:12.517
It says that there's these
Stairs.

03:12.551 --> 03:15.862
I have no idea where they are,
Which is interesting because

03:15.896 --> 03:17.931
I've kind of scoured this beach,
I thought.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.310
But I didn't see anything.

03:19.344 --> 03:22.620
I mean, granted, this island is
Huge.

03:22.655 --> 03:26.137
It's exhausting.

03:29.103 --> 03:30.448
Do you see anything?

03:30.482 --> 03:32.137
No.

03:32.172 --> 03:33.068
There's no step paths.

03:33.103 --> 03:35.551
My god!

03:35.586 --> 03:40.724
I don't know how far I need
To go or if I'm just wandering.

03:40.758 --> 03:41.689
Endlessly.

03:41.724 --> 03:44.137
It's difficult because this
Island is huge.

03:44.172 --> 03:47.344
But then, I see the steps.

03:47.379 --> 03:48.206
We're at the steps.

03:48.241 --> 03:49.034
Are we?

03:49.068 --> 03:54.551
Without a doubt.

03:54.586 --> 04:02.586
Probli'm tired.

04:04.413 --> 04:07.931
Something's in there.

04:07.965 --> 04:10.310
It's rice!

04:10.344 --> 04:11.482
Thank god!

04:11.517 --> 04:13.793
Yay!

04:13.827 --> 04:19.482
Hala-freaking-lula.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.067
My god.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.586
This is hardly any rice.

04:22.620 --> 04:23.793
My god.

04:23.827 --> 04:26.172
Damn it!

04:26.206 --> 04:31.517
That freaking note says, "You
Have to work hard for everyth."

04:31.551 --> 04:32.206
Everything."

04:32.241 --> 04:34.758
We have to do this every day.

04:34.793 --> 04:38.103
Apparently, every time we've got
To climb up mount everest to.

04:38.137 --> 04:43.206
Find a little bit of rice.

04:43.241 --> 04:51.241
This sucks!

04:52.586 --> 05:00.586
Come on in, guys!

05:01.034 --> 05:04.241
Kama getting your first look at
The new manu tribe.

05:04.275 --> 05:08.827
Keith voted out at the last
Tribal council.

05:08.862 --> 05:11.551
All right, for today's
Challenge, you're going to race.

05:11.586 --> 05:14.586
To assemble a wheelbarrow.

05:14.620 --> 05:18.000
You'll push is through a series
Of obstacles collecting.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.137
Sandbags.

05:19.172 --> 05:22.034
You'll then dump the sandbags
Into a trough, take the.

05:22.068 --> 05:26.172
Wheelbarrow apart, and use the
Pieces to build a slickshot.

05:26.206 --> 05:30.413
You'll use the slingshot to fire
Sandbacks at targets.

05:30.448 --> 05:35.448
The first tribe to knock down
All four targets wins reward.

05:35.482 --> 05:36.493
You want to know what you're
Playing for?

05:36.517 --> 05:37.482
Yes!

05:37.517 --> 05:39.551
Once again you have a Choice.

05:39.586 --> 05:44.689
Comfort.

05:44.724 --> 05:45.724
Or...

05:48.172 --> 05:52.448
You got it.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.827
Chickens.

05:53.862 --> 05:54.724
Wow!

05:54.758 --> 05:57.000
I love chickens.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.034
Three hens, one Rooster.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.034
Big choice.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.838
Cam aykama, you have two extra p
Sitting two out.

06:01.862 --> 06:06.896
Who is it going to be?

06:06.931 --> 06:09.103
Everybody else gets a minute to
Strategize.

06:09.137 --> 06:09.758
We'll get started.

06:09.793 --> 06:14.758
It's going to be fun.

06:14.793 --> 06:16.103
All right, here we go.

06:16.137 --> 06:17.344
For reward.

06:17.379 --> 06:20.862
Survivors ready?

06:20.896 --> 06:23.000
Go!

06:23.034 --> 06:24.655
The first thing you.

06:24.689 --> 06:28.000
Have to do is assemble the
Wheelbarrow.

06:28.034 --> 06:32.482
That's going to take team work,
Good communication.

06:32.517 --> 06:37.827
Manu quickly working together to
Get the wheel and the axle in.

06:37.862 --> 06:43.379
Kama now has their wheel in.

06:43.413 --> 06:46.000
David guiding them.

06:46.034 --> 06:48.862
Keep going!

06:48.896 --> 06:50.586
Let's go!

06:50.620 --> 06:55.620
It's manu out of the Gate first.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.724
The trib who has yet to win a
Challenge this season.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.344
This thing is heavy.

06:59.379 --> 07:01.448
Kama now right on Their tail.

07:01.482 --> 07:05.034
It is erik, julie, and joe for
Kama.

07:05.068 --> 07:09.241
It is david, devon, and war dog
For manu.

07:09.275 --> 07:10.206

There you go!

07:16.655 --> 07:18.034
Now you're good!

07:18.068 --> 07:20.148
Now you're untying knots trying
To release that first batch of.

07:20.172 --> 07:21.586
Sandbags.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.827
Kama untied their knots a lot
Faster.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.344
Kama is now in the lead.

07:27.379 --> 07:30.448
Manu now has their sandbags.

07:30.482 --> 07:31.413

Doing a nice job of maneuvering.

07:37.379 --> 07:38.172
Their wheelbarrow.

07:38.206 --> 07:38.827
It is heavy.

07:38.862 --> 07:39.793
It is awkward.

07:39.827 --> 07:44.379
Nothing about it is easy.

07:44.413 --> 07:47.344
Kama now wheeling into that
Second batch of sandbags.

Julia, and victoria.

08:17.793 --> 08:19.965
Turn it this way.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.517
They have to take it
Apart and build a slingshot.

08:26.551 --> 08:29.965
Manu has to toss by hand, taking
More time.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.344
You've got to get them all in
There.

The wheelbarrow and build a.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.413
Slingshot.

08:45.448 --> 08:46.758
Good job.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.206
Good job.

08:49.241 --> 08:51.379
Kama struggling to Get it in.

08:51.413 --> 08:52.586
Something is not lining up.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.724
And here comes manu now.

08:54.758 --> 08:56.482
You will know when it's in.

08:56.517 --> 08:59.655

09:09.448 --> 09:13.310
Once again, chris is in the hero
Role.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.493
Can he get it done this time?

09:14.517 --> 09:16.034
And he does.

09:16.068 --> 09:17.241
Manu has their first.

09:17.275 --> 09:22.379
It's going to be gavin for kama
And chris for manu.

09:22.413 --> 09:23.862
There are four targets.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.103
You've got to knock down all
Four.

09:26.137 --> 09:29.793
Gavin just misses.

09:29.827 --> 09:33.068
Chris hits the second target for
Manu!

09:33.103 --> 09:36.172
Manu has half their targets
Down, only two lift.

09:36.206 --> 09:37.620

Go.

Big reward on the line.

09:42.793 --> 09:45.896
Julia knocks the first target
Down for kama.

09:45.931 --> 09:46.965
She's going to go again.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.827
It is 2-1.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.827
You got it.

09:50.862 --> 09:51.620
Chris back.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.068
And he's got the third target.

09:53.103 --> 09:54.034
One target left.

09:54.068 --> 09:58.827
One more!

09:58.862 --> 10:02.103
Julie just misses on The second.

10:02.137 --> 10:03.320
Chris could win it right here.

10:03.344 --> 10:04.896
Love it, chris, love it.

10:04.931 --> 10:06.000

Challenge of the season!

10:16.172 --> 10:18.517
Good job, everybody.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.413
We needed that win.

10:21.448 --> 10:24.241
Manu, first win of The season.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.172
It's a big one.

10:25.206 --> 10:27.413
What's it going to be, comfort
Or chickens?

10:27.448 --> 10:28.206
Chicken.

10:28.241 --> 10:29.413
Chicken.

10:29.448 --> 10:32.000
All right, manu,
Chickens will be waiting for you.

10:32.034 --> 10:33.172
Back at camp.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.769
Grab your stuff, head back to
Camp, and enjoy your best.

10:34.793 --> 10:36.000
Victory.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.482
Cam ai got nothing for you.

10:37.517 --> 10:38.034
Grab your stuff.

10:38.068 --> 10:38.862
Head back to camp.

10:38.896 --> 10:41.275
Thanks, jeff.

10:41.310 --> 10:42.241
We should be happy.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.482
It's our first win.

10:44.517 --> 10:48.586
But suddenly, my ankle started
Throbbing when I was leaving the.

10:48.620 --> 10:52.034
Challenge, and I looked down and
It was really tender, and it.

10:52.068 --> 10:56.241
Started looking swollen, and now
I can't even move it.

10:56.275 --> 10:58.517
It keeps getting worse.

11:17.482 --> 11:18.034
I don't care.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.586
Just drop me wherever.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.413
In the second part of the
Challenge we had to disassemble.

11:22.448 --> 11:28.551
The wheelbarrow and I lifted up
A pin and it fell on my ankle.

11:28.586 --> 11:31.482
I was so focused on the
Challenge I thought I'll worry.

11:31.517 --> 11:32.689
About it later.

11:32.724 --> 11:36.241
It hurt and I just pulled my
Foot out, and I got the wheel.

11:36.275 --> 11:39.206
Out, and we ran to finish.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.275
And I didn't notice.

11:40.310 --> 11:43.103
It was hurting but not this bad.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.413
As I'm walking to camp, I guess
I calmed down or something, and.

11:46.448 --> 11:49.931
It just started throbbing and
Progressively got worse and.

11:49.965 --> 11:51.068
Worse.

11:51.103 --> 11:53.551
And I'm just, like, worried
Because I've never broken.

11:53.586 --> 11:54.827
Anything.

11:54.862 --> 11:55.931
I don't know.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.103
Like, I just eye just don't want
This to be serious.

11:59.137 --> 12:02.724
Seriously, if you need
Anything, call us.

12:02.758 --> 12:05.344
We'll grab it for you.

12:05.379 --> 12:06.034
Okay?

12:06.068 --> 12:09.758
Let's give her some space.

12:09.793 --> 12:12.896
I would like to look at our
Beautiful chickens.

12:12.931 --> 12:17.275
My god!

12:18.551 --> 12:21.034
No, he's going to be dead.

12:21.068 --> 12:25.758
The chickens, we can eat the
Chickens before our most.

12:25.793 --> 12:26.907
Important immunity challenge.

12:26.931 --> 12:29.413
I'm so pumped.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.044
Rotisserie chicken sounds
Amazing, doesn't it?

12:31.068 --> 12:34.551
All I have to do is sit here
In pain and listen to what.

12:34.586 --> 12:38.000
They're going to do to these
Chickens and it's so upsetting.

12:38.034 --> 12:39.827
I'm just like, poor chickens.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.793
What did they do to the players?

12:41.827 --> 12:45.172
Like, the players signed up for
The game not the chickens.

12:45.206 --> 12:47.517
So why should they be penalized.

12:47.551 --> 12:50.000
It takes a couple of hours to
Kill it, pluck it.

12:50.034 --> 12:51.148
Who is killing the chicken?

12:51.172 --> 12:52.241
God.

12:52.275 --> 12:54.896
There's no way I'm killing
Anything.

12:54.931 --> 12:56.734
If they're going to lay eggs,
That's awesome, that's why we.

12:56.758 --> 13:00.344
Shouldn't kill them all.

13:00.379 --> 13:05.034
Coming into this game, I
Always said, if my tribe were to.

13:05.068 --> 13:07.344
Win chickens, I would release
The chickens.

13:07.379 --> 13:12.206
But how... how would I be able to
Do it with this busted ankle.

13:12.241 --> 13:15.620
I think they're going to get
At least one.

13:15.655 --> 13:17.034
Not today.

13:17.068 --> 13:21.206
Did the chickens do?

13:21.241 --> 13:24.275
You eat chicken back home,
Though, right?

13:24.310 --> 13:26.000
We're bleeding heart hypocrites.

13:26.034 --> 13:29.206
These chickens don't deserve
To die.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.517
I'm with you.

13:30.551 --> 13:34.862
Convince them not to kill the
Chickens then to prove it.

13:34.896 --> 13:39.241
I'm not I setting the chicken
Free.

13:39.275 --> 13:41.827
I wouldn't tell on you.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.931
But I think it would come back
To haunt you.

13:44.965 --> 13:46.689
I need an accomplice.

13:46.724 --> 13:49.827
I... I count my out.

13:49.862 --> 13:50.965
Count me out.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.310
It was probably the most
Surprising part of my game so.

13:53.344 --> 13:58.827
Far when wendy asked me to be an
Accomplice in a jail break.

13:58.862 --> 14:00.448
She wants to set chickens free.

14:00.482 --> 14:02.965
She's literally willing to
Sacrifice her entire game of.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.655
"Survivor" to save these
Chickens.

14:04.689 --> 14:09.206
I don't think I've ever met
Anyone like wend pep she's a.

14:09.241 --> 14:12.241
Lovable, emotional nut.

14:20.620 --> 14:26.448
We lost the reward challenge
Today, which kind of sucks.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.448
But we haven't lost an immunity
Challenge yet.

14:28.482 --> 14:29.734
We haven't had to go to tribal
Yet.

14:29.758 --> 14:31.965
And that's way more important.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.310
You were so great.

14:33.344 --> 14:34.413
They got lucky.

14:34.448 --> 14:35.000
Whatever.

14:35.034 --> 14:35.586
We're all still here.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.931
That's all that matters.

14:37.965 --> 14:40.379
Let's rest tonight and let's
Crush them tomorrow.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.896
I have found myself in a
Group of six... me, julie, julia,

14:44.931 --> 14:46.551
Gavin, ron, and erik.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.724
Which makes a lot of sense
Because there's a general.

14:48.758 --> 14:51.655
Feeling on the tribe that
Returning players have played.

14:51.689 --> 14:52.241
Before.

14:52.275 --> 14:53.517
They've had their shot.

14:53.551 --> 14:56.689
This is our first chance, and we
Should get to play before they.

14:56.724 --> 14:58.000
Do.

14:58.034 --> 15:05.379
Joe and aubry are a target, and
Aurora is the only one who seems

15:05.413 --> 15:06.872
1,000% on board with the
Returning players.

15:06.896 --> 15:11.241
So if we were to lose the next
Immunity and we had to go to.

15:11.275 --> 15:15.034
Tribal I think one of them's got
To go.

15:15.068 --> 15:18.724
Hoare you feeling about
Everything?

15:18.758 --> 15:19.344
About?

15:19.379 --> 15:21.000
If we lose a challenge?

15:21.034 --> 15:24.551
I feel like if we lose, we've
Got six of us.

15:24.586 --> 15:27.413
It's a matter of deciding which
One of the three you want to.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.724
Vote out.

15:30.758 --> 15:33.793
In joe and aubry kind of come
As a pair.

15:33.827 --> 15:34.379
They do.

15:34.413 --> 15:38.344
What do we do?

15:38.379 --> 15:40.586
You and aubry are a pair?

15:40.620 --> 15:43.793
I mean, we are kind of on the
Bottom of the barrel.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.517
I don't think there is a Barrel.

15:45.551 --> 15:48.310
I mean overall like, you
Know, what I mean.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.310
Of all the people playing in the
Game.

15:50.344 --> 15:51.965
My god.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.034
Joe is over there, and I had no
Idea!

15:55.068 --> 15:57.310
You guys feel good?

15:57.344 --> 16:01.517
I mean, obviously, we can tell
That you guys are all kind of.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.941
Talking amongst yourselves and
Trying to figure it out, and me.

16:03.965 --> 16:05.206
And her, we're getting nervous.

16:05.241 --> 16:10.896
I feel like I just can't get a
Read on victoria and ron because.

16:10.931 --> 16:13.182
You ask them kind of what
They're thinking, and they only.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.482
Give you nothing.

16:14.517 --> 16:19.206
So I have a funny feeling that I
Might be on the chopping block.

16:19.241 --> 16:20.137
So do you guys feel good?

16:20.172 --> 16:21.000
Yup.

16:21.034 --> 16:21.793
Okay.

16:21.827 --> 16:23.172
I mean, it's very clear.

16:23.206 --> 16:26.931
Yeah, I got super weird Vibes?

16:26.965 --> 16:27.344
Same.

16:27.379 --> 16:29.103
Okay.

16:29.137 --> 16:33.000
I think joe is looking for
Redemption, just like I am, and.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.344
We are scared coming into this
New group of players.

16:35.379 --> 16:37.896
I guess this is the point in
The game now where...

16:37.931 --> 16:41.034
at least we're seeing what
People's true colors are.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.310
I think returnees are an easy
Target.

16:43.344 --> 16:50.896
So I feel like I do need the
Idol.

16:50.931 --> 16:52.344
I'm looking for the idol.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.689
I'm looking high, low, in trees.

16:55.724 --> 17:00.758
I dig up around tree mail,
Digging on the side of the path.

17:00.793 --> 17:07.586
Looking in trees.

17:07.619 --> 17:12.689
I mean, it's something I've
Dreamed about my entire.

17:12.723 --> 17:13.758
"Survivor" experience.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.344
I feel like it's in here.

17:15.378 --> 17:20.827
I've done nearly everything in
"Survivor," except win and get a.

17:20.862 --> 17:21.964
Hidden immunity idol.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.758
And I know how hard it is to
Win, and I'm here to win.

17:25.792 --> 17:30.275
But first I need to check one
More thing off my "Survivor".

17:30.310 --> 17:31.413
Checklist.

17:31.448 --> 17:33.044
I want every experience on
"Survivor," and that's one I.

17:33.068 --> 17:35.034
Haven't had.

17:35.068 --> 17:37.275
So I keep looking.

17:37.310 --> 17:38.241
There's something here.

17:38.275 --> 17:46.275
Anything I can see to find the
Idol.

17:53.206 --> 17:59.517
Can the congratulations!

17:59.551 --> 18:02.137
"You have found the hidden
Immunity idol."

18:02.172 --> 18:05.655
I find the idol, and I break
Down in tears.

18:05.689 --> 18:08.931
I never... I never thought I'd
Find one.

18:08.965 --> 18:12.379
And I've been through so much in
"Survivor," and this is.

18:12.413 --> 18:14.413
Something that I haven't gotten
Yet.

18:14.448 --> 18:17.034
I'm so proud of myself.

18:17.068 --> 18:19.379
It's worth the effort to work
Through the struggle.

18:19.413 --> 18:21.620
And I love this game so much.

18:21.655 --> 18:29.655
I'm going to make it work for
Me.

18:32.724 --> 18:35.896
All creatures scerve to live.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.931
Do you eat meat at all?

18:37.965 --> 18:40.379
If you were to kill the
Animal, I wouldn't.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.286
You can eat it from the store
But you wouldn't if somebody.

18:42.310 --> 18:44.310
Else did it.

18:46.413 --> 18:52.655
They're dead already, but
They're actually treated worse.

18:52.689 --> 18:56.379
We need to try to win this
Game, and to win this game we.

18:56.413 --> 18:57.034
Need strength.

18:57.068 --> 18:59.517
Wendy is losing her mind.

18:59.551 --> 19:02.482
Back home she eats chicken and
Pork and meat and all that.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.758
She's like, "I know I'm
Hypocrital."

19:05.793 --> 19:09.413
I said, "Absolutely right,
You're hip kittal."

19:09.448 --> 19:12.241
but we're not.

19:12.275 --> 19:16.413
If you can so help tyou can be a
Vegetarian.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.448
You're going to be a vegetarian?

19:18.482 --> 19:18.862
Yes.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.103
All right.

19:20.137 --> 19:22.458
Even when she's on the losing
Side of an argument, she's so.

19:22.482 --> 19:26.931
Stubborn to the point she said
She's going to be a vegetarian.

19:26.965 --> 19:31.379
Wendy, mark my words, the minute
I find out you have one piece of.

19:31.413 --> 19:33.965
Meat in your belly just don't
Talk to me again.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.724
She's lost her rocker.

19:38.758 --> 19:40.931
You want to kill it, fine.

19:40.965 --> 19:41.344
Whatever.

19:41.379 --> 19:42.586
I'll kill it.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.551
But do not sit on your high
Horse and tell me that we can't.

19:45.586 --> 19:46.448
Eat that chicken.

19:46.482 --> 19:49.620
Doesn't she eat chicken back
Home?

19:49.655 --> 19:53.655
Chicken you eat at home comes
From a worse place than here

19:53.689 --> 19:54.862
it's ridiculous.

19:54.896 --> 19:58.517
If this tribe loses again, I
Would want to target wendy.

19:58.551 --> 20:01.034
Because wendy does not want to
Kill the chickens.

20:01.068 --> 20:04.448
She had to be carried into camp
Because her ankle is so bad, and.

20:04.482 --> 20:07.724
On top of that, I saw one vote
At tribal for me, and that was.

20:07.758 --> 20:08.689
From wendy.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.862
There is one thing I wanted to
Tell you guys.

20:10.896 --> 20:15.931
At some point, people... sometime
It's better to stick together.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.793
I don't know.

20:16.827 --> 20:18.689
We've got four right here,
Right?

20:18.724 --> 20:21.034
I mean, if you're coming
After me, I have to get you.

20:21.068 --> 20:22.000
Before you get me.

20:22.034 --> 20:23.000
It's kill or be killed.

20:23.034 --> 20:29.000
If you come after me, like, I
Mean, watch out.

20:44.965 --> 20:47.137
To get to today's immunity
Challenge?

20:47.172 --> 20:48.310
Yes!

20:48.344 --> 20:51.206
First things first,
Julie, got to take back the.

20:51.241 --> 20:53.000
Idol.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.206
We noticed.

20:56.241 --> 20:59.344
Watch out.

20:59.379 --> 21:02.137
Once again, immunity
Is back up for grabs.

21:02.172 --> 21:06.310
For today's challenge, three
Tribe members will be in a boat.

21:06.344 --> 21:10.793
The other four tribe members
Will be tethered to the boat.

21:10.827 --> 21:16.241
On my "Go," those four will dive
In, begin swimming and put boat.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.689
To a tall tower.

21:17.724 --> 21:20.551
Wowns reach the tower, the tribe
Members in the boat, will climb.

21:20.586 --> 21:23.172
Up, leap off, and grab a key.

21:23.206 --> 21:27.655
Once you have all three keys,
You'll use them to unlock a.

21:27.689 --> 21:28.379
Chest.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.793
Inside the chess, puzzle piece.

21:30.827 --> 21:36.344
Use the puzzle pieces to solve a
Chip's wheel.

21:36.379 --> 21:41.034
First tribe to spin their wheel,
Raise their flag, wins immunity,

21:41.068 --> 21:42.448
Safe from the vote.

21:42.482 --> 21:44.896
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will become the third.

21:44.931 --> 21:49.931
"Edge of extinction."

21:49.965 --> 21:52.689
Kama, you have two extra
Players.

21:52.724 --> 21:57.034
You're going to sit two out.

21:57.068 --> 21:58.275
Victoria, julia will sit out.

21:58.310 --> 22:00.517
Give you a minute to strategize.

22:00.551 --> 22:01.931
We'll get started.

22:01.965 --> 22:04.034
All right, here we go.

22:04.068 --> 22:05.413
For immunity.

22:05.448 --> 22:08.689
Survivors ready?

22:08.724 --> 22:12.793
Go!

22:12.827 --> 22:14.758
Brand-new "Survivor" challenge.

22:14.793 --> 22:18.965
Four members of each tribe will
Swim literally pulling their.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.827
Other tribe members in a boat.

22:20.862 --> 22:23.034
You are trying to get them to
That tower.

22:23.068 --> 22:24.344
Come on, guys!

22:24.379 --> 22:25.068
Let's go!

22:25.103 --> 22:25.586
Let's go!

22:25.620 --> 22:27.655
Good job, guys!

22:27.689 --> 22:30.448
Out of the gate, we
Are dead even.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.965
You're doing great!

22:32.000 --> 22:38.275
That is what you call
Team work right there.

22:38.310 --> 22:42.137
Wendy, even with a bad ankle,
Very good in the water.

22:42.172 --> 22:45.068
We are neck and neck right now.

22:45.103 --> 22:46.689
You've got to get to the ring.

22:46.724 --> 22:50.448
That will line up the boat.

22:50.482 --> 22:52.586
Go, go, go!

22:52.620 --> 22:53.000
Go!

22:53.034 --> 22:53.965
Wait, wait!

22:54.000 --> 22:56.482
It's going to be
David heading up.

22:56.517 --> 22:58.862
Kama is there.

22:58.896 --> 23:06.103
There goes gavin.

23:06.137 --> 23:07.413
Gavin has the key for kama.

23:07.448 --> 23:08.655
He's got to get back.

23:08.689 --> 23:10.379
David has the key for manu.

23:10.413 --> 23:12.689
He's got to get back.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.517
You're good!

23:13.551 --> 23:14.655
Go, wentworth!

23:14.689 --> 23:17.448
Gotta get in the boat.

23:17.482 --> 23:21.379
You're good, go, Julia.

23:21.413 --> 23:24.689
Wentworth now out on the beam
Looking for that second key.

23:24.724 --> 23:26.620
Kelley has hers.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.689
Julia has it.

23:27.724 --> 23:33.482
She's in the water.

23:33.517 --> 23:34.241
Go, lauren!

23:34.275 --> 23:35.862
Go, go!

23:35.896 --> 23:43.551
Manu in the lead Right now.

23:43.586 --> 23:46.758
Lauren has the third key.

23:46.793 --> 23:47.689
Gaubry!

23:47.724 --> 23:52.172
Aubry heading for her third and
Final key.

23:52.206 --> 24:00.206
Start swimming in.

24:01.137 --> 24:02.965
Aubry with the third key for
Kama.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.862
She's got to get back to the
Boat.

24:05.896 --> 24:06.413
You're good!

24:06.448 --> 24:10.034
Go!

24:10.068 --> 24:12.551
Kama trying to get back in this.

24:12.586 --> 24:13.655
You're good, manu.

24:13.689 --> 24:14.517
Get up!

24:14.551 --> 24:16.000
Get up that ladder.

24:16.034 --> 24:20.482
Let's go, guys.

24:20.517 --> 24:24.172
Kama trying to stay Close.

24:24.206 --> 24:25.724
Manu still in the lead now.

24:25.758 --> 24:28.758
They have won only one challenge
This season.

24:28.793 --> 24:30.103
Here comes kama.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.965
Gotta get everybody here.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
You're good.

24:33.034 --> 24:34.034
Go, aubry.

24:34.068 --> 24:35.827
It is david on the keys for
Manu.

24:35.862 --> 24:38.724
He's got that chest open.

24:38.758 --> 24:42.241
There are three sets of pieces.

24:42.275 --> 24:48.724
You're solving that one first.

24:48.758 --> 24:50.551
Kama now has their chest open.

24:50.586 --> 24:54.103
They can start working on the
Wheel.

24:54.137 --> 24:55.793
The first bag are the spokes.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.448
You have to figure out which
Pieces go together so that they.

24:58.482 --> 24:59.482
Fit in perfectly.

24:59.517 --> 25:04.862
This is a puzzle in the form of
A ship's wheel.

25:04.896 --> 25:07.103
Manu won the last challenge for
Reward.

25:07.137 --> 25:10.517
They have yet to win an immunity
Challenge.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.689
No, this isn't long enough,
Right?

25:12.724 --> 25:13.862
Yes, it is.

25:13.896 --> 25:14.724
It works.

25:14.758 --> 25:15.965
It's all about Communication.

25:16.000 --> 25:16.586
Perfect.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.689
Where does this one go?

25:19.724 --> 25:23.310
Kama quickly back in This.

25:23.344 --> 25:26.862
They think they have the spokes
Together.

25:26.896 --> 25:29.206
Good job, kama!

25:29.241 --> 25:30.896
Come on, guys!

25:30.931 --> 25:33.137
Kama moving on to bag
Number two.

25:33.172 --> 25:35.103
They've got their spokes put
Together.

25:35.137 --> 25:37.344
It's now manu who is struggling.

25:37.379 --> 25:38.620
It's not going to work.

25:38.655 --> 25:40.655
This one, this one!

25:40.689 --> 25:41.586
Come on!

25:41.620 --> 25:43.482
You look at it and you tell me
What to do.

25:43.517 --> 25:46.000
The two veterans,
David and wentworth, struggling.

25:46.034 --> 25:48.379
On this puzzle and they have
Given up the lead.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.724
They are absolutely nowhere with
The spokes.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.000
Those don't go together.

25:52.034 --> 25:53.103
I know.

25:53.137 --> 25:54.551
This can't go here.

25:54.586 --> 25:55.620
Why is this on here?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.793
Immunity on the line.

25:57.827 --> 26:04.275
Kama has a big lead right now,
And they know it.

26:04.310 --> 26:08.689
Kama moving on to that third and
Final section.

26:08.724 --> 26:10.034
Where they put the handles in.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.068
Okay, okay.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.965
Go, go!

26:13.000 --> 26:18.344
Manu is wrong again!

26:18.379 --> 26:18.965
Wow!

26:19.000 --> 26:24.689
Kama thinks they have it.

26:24.724 --> 26:26.448
For the win.

26:26.482 --> 26:29.034
Woooo!

26:29.068 --> 26:33.000
Kama wins immunity
Sending manu back to tribal.

26:33.034 --> 26:35.310
Council.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.034
Sorry.

26:37.068 --> 26:39.034
Sorry, guys.

26:39.068 --> 26:41.344
Puzzles are hard.

26:41.379 --> 26:43.965
Puzzles are hard.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.724
Kama, for the third
Straight time, immunity yours.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.482
Nobody going home from your
Tribe.

26:51.517 --> 26:52.344
Grab your stuff.

26:52.379 --> 26:53.689
Head back to camp.

26:53.724 --> 26:56.758
Enjoy another night off.

26:56.793 --> 26:59.655
Once again, manu, tribal
Council, somebody will be the.

26:59.689 --> 27:02.586
Third person voted out of this
Game.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.758
Grab your stuff.

27:03.793 --> 27:04.965
Head back to camp.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.413
See you tonight at tribal.

27:06.448 --> 27:09.793
Losing the immunity challenge
Was incredibly devastating, but

27:09.827 --> 27:11.803
I've always been wanting to
Target wentworth, and I think.

27:11.827 --> 27:15.034
People are going to be really
Focused on wendy.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.206
So I have a real opportunity to
Take out wentworth.

27:17.241 --> 27:19.931
I trust my "Survivor" instincts.

27:19.965 --> 27:23.965
It's telling me right now target
Wentworth.

27:50.896 --> 27:53.896
Challenge, I'm injured, and I
Still killed it.

27:53.931 --> 27:55.793
I feel like dithe best I could
Have done.

27:55.827 --> 27:57.310
I'm really sorry, guys.

27:57.344 --> 27:58.413
No, no.

27:58.448 --> 27:59.310
I'm sorry.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.620
You guys have nothing to be
Sorry about.

28:01.655 --> 28:05.517
I'm bummed because I know all
Eyes are on me at the moment and

28:05.551 --> 28:07.931
I feel like tonight I'm going
Home.

28:07.965 --> 28:10.655
This is the lowest of low so
Far.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.068
I just want to cook the
Chicken for us.

28:13.103 --> 28:14.551
Are you guys okay with that?

28:14.586 --> 28:15.620
I'm okay with it.

28:15.655 --> 28:18.103
You don't have to convince me
To kill a chicken.

28:18.137 --> 28:22.103
If it's up to me tonight,
They're not eating that chicken.

28:22.137 --> 28:23.551
Ready to do that thing.

28:23.586 --> 28:25.482
I have to find my flint.

28:25.517 --> 28:26.103
Where is the flint?

28:26.137 --> 28:28.551
The flint is on the...

28:28.586 --> 28:30.241
don't do it to me, all.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.724
Don't do it to me.

28:31.758 --> 28:33.551
It's supposed to go there.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.448
Dude, I'm the last one that
Started it.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.310
And it was in that area.

28:37.344 --> 28:39.724
You think you left it in this
Area?

28:39.758 --> 28:41.413
I did not touch it from here.

28:41.448 --> 28:43.551
I would wait to kill the
Chicken?

28:43.586 --> 28:44.068
Yeah.

28:44.103 --> 28:44.931
Where's wendy at?

28:44.965 --> 28:45.862
She walked off.

28:45.896 --> 28:47.103
She walked off?

28:47.137 --> 28:48.137
Down the beach.

28:48.172 --> 28:50.482
Do you think she took it to
Save her chicken?

28:50.517 --> 28:51.965
No, that would be insane.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.482
That would be psychotic.

28:54.517 --> 28:57.517
I took their flint.

28:57.551 --> 28:58.793
I'm sure it's around here.

28:58.827 --> 29:02.172
Being the smatter I am, I
Thought they can't cook a.

29:02.206 --> 29:04.206
Chicken without fire.

29:04.241 --> 29:07.241
And they can't make a fire
Without flint.

29:07.275 --> 29:08.907
Is there any possibility that
Webdy took it?

29:08.931 --> 29:12.344
She was up to the camp while
We were all talking and as soon.

29:12.379 --> 29:14.241
As we were done, she runs away.

29:14.275 --> 29:16.137
She did actually come to Camp.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.000
Would you mind asking her, Dude?

29:18.034 --> 29:20.172
Should I be the one.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.413
Just ask her.

29:21.448 --> 29:23.286
, "Girl, do you have the flint?"
I'll go with you.

29:23.310 --> 29:26.137
The flint, it disappeared,
And there's this theory floating.

29:26.172 --> 29:29.137
Around that maybe wendy took it
Because she's been against us.

29:29.172 --> 29:30.275
Cooking the chicken.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.034
Strategy here.

29:31.068 --> 29:31.827
Approaching her.

29:31.862 --> 29:33.103
How are you?

29:33.137 --> 29:38.068
I'll let you approach, and
I'll just kind of... at the right.

29:38.103 --> 29:41.413
Time I'll come in like bad cop.

29:41.448 --> 29:43.620
Everyone is losing their mind
Because of the flint.

29:43.655 --> 29:47.482
They're probably going to want
To vote out wendy because of the.

29:47.517 --> 29:50.172
Chicken debate but I want to
Take out wentworth.

29:50.206 --> 29:53.034
You may get your wish about
The chicken.

29:53.068 --> 29:55.103
We actually can't seem to find
The flint.

29:55.137 --> 29:57.000
You haven't seen it lying
Around, have you?

29:57.034 --> 29:58.241
Chris had it.

29:58.275 --> 30:02.413
Yeah, chris had it, and he
Doesn't know where he put it.

30:02.448 --> 30:05.827
He had it this morning.

30:05.862 --> 30:11.896
How do you feel, talking shop
A little bit about tonight.

30:11.931 --> 30:14.724
Let's say I were to be going
Home today.

30:14.758 --> 30:17.758
You may not go home.

30:17.793 --> 30:19.413
What are you thinking right Now?

30:19.448 --> 30:21.172
It would be cool to make a
Big move.

30:21.206 --> 30:22.413
It's got to be kelley.

30:22.448 --> 30:23.310
Right.

30:23.344 --> 30:25.413
But ift requires some
Conversations...

30:25.448 --> 30:28.241
you guys go ahead, and I'm
Sorry... don't think I'm sulking.

30:28.275 --> 30:30.896
Wendy is absolutely the best
Smoke screen.

30:30.931 --> 30:36.931
She has delivered on a silver
Platter, vote me out.

30:38.931 --> 30:41.103
We'll get the fire going.

30:41.137 --> 30:41.758
Did you find it.

30:41.793 --> 30:42.758
She didn't take it.

30:42.793 --> 30:43.896
She did not.

30:43.931 --> 30:44.344
No.

30:44.379 --> 30:45.689
I don't, so.

30:45.724 --> 30:48.137
Where is it.

30:48.172 --> 30:49.517
David, it's still wendy.

30:49.551 --> 30:50.655
Yeah, yeah.

30:50.689 --> 30:52.448
I don't want to vote out wendy.

30:52.482 --> 30:54.275
I think wendy is someone I can
Use.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.172
She's loyal to me.

30:55.206 --> 30:56.758
She'll vote with me I think
Every time.

30:56.793 --> 30:58.172
You want to kill the chicken?

30:58.206 --> 30:59.172
Yeah.

30:59.206 --> 31:02.034
What we really want is to
Send kelley home.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.251
Kelley wentworth needs to go
Home.

31:03.275 --> 31:09.137
And now, it's a matter of
Pulling over chris.

31:09.172 --> 31:12.137
What do you want to do Tonight?

31:12.172 --> 31:14.482
I think the safest thing to
Do is wentworth.

31:14.517 --> 31:15.034
Wentworth?

31:15.068 --> 31:18.137
Yeah.

31:18.172 --> 31:20.793
Don't say anything to lauren or
War dog.

31:20.827 --> 31:23.517
I think war dog would be a
Number.

31:23.551 --> 31:24.907
I'm going to be honest with You.

31:24.931 --> 31:28.448
I think... I really believe in my
Heart of hearts if you tell war.

31:28.482 --> 31:32.103
Dog what we're doing tonight,
This entire thing blows apart.

31:32.137 --> 31:33.344
Kelley is not going home.

31:33.379 --> 31:36.241
He's in much tighter with her
Than anybody knows.

31:36.275 --> 31:38.758
Wentworth, she's too good to
Keep around.

31:38.793 --> 31:42.482
The problem si'm in pretty close
With war dog, and david wants it.

31:42.517 --> 31:44.034
To be just us four.

31:44.068 --> 31:49.586
But back home in my real life,
I'm someone who is open with.

31:49.620 --> 31:50.793
Everybody.

31:50.827 --> 31:56.103
So my biggest fear is that I
Burn bridges with some of the.

31:56.137 --> 31:58.413
Relationships I've built out
Here.

31:58.448 --> 31:59.413
Just to prepare for tonight.

31:59.448 --> 32:00.034
Yeah.

32:00.068 --> 32:00.724
What are you thinking?

32:00.758 --> 32:02.206
I mean, wendy.

32:02.241 --> 32:02.827
Is it?

32:02.862 --> 32:03.931
What do you think?

32:03.965 --> 32:05.586
I mean, talk to me.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.068
Do you have another idea?

32:07.103 --> 32:08.344
We could brainstorm now.

32:08.379 --> 32:09.448
Yeah.

32:09.482 --> 32:12.241
I think it's either going to be
Wendy or wentworth.

32:12.275 --> 32:14.758
She plays this game kind of like
A snake, dude.

32:14.793 --> 32:18.482
I'll go with what you want to
Do.

32:18.517 --> 32:20.241
Wendy shouldn't obvious vote
Tonight.

32:20.275 --> 32:22.931
Wendy's got a hurt ankle.

32:22.965 --> 32:27.896
Wendy doesn't want anything to
Do with any of the chickens.

32:27.931 --> 32:32.655
But chris approached me for the
Second time to keep options over.

32:32.689 --> 32:33.689
To take out wentworth.

32:33.724 --> 32:36.344
I trust wentworth more than
Chris.

32:36.379 --> 32:39.931
I decide maybe it's not wendy or
Wentworth.

32:39.965 --> 32:40.620
Maybe it's chris.

32:40.655 --> 32:42.068
Chris, he's out to get you.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.172
This guy's a problem.

32:43.206 --> 32:44.827
I want him out.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.068
This guy...
what votes do we have?

32:47.103 --> 32:48.251
It's basically four-three,
Right.

32:48.275 --> 32:51.482
I just have to get rick and
We have to keep it shush.

32:51.517 --> 32:53.034
Tell me what rick says.

32:53.068 --> 32:54.862
What do we do with this guy?

32:54.896 --> 32:56.344
Get him out.

32:56.379 --> 32:59.793
So chris is coming after me now,
Saying my name and trying.

32:59.827 --> 33:03.034
Potentially put this plan
Together to get me out.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.482
That's not going to work for me.

33:04.517 --> 33:07.034
If you're coming for me, like,
You have to go.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.000
No more wendy.

33:08.034 --> 33:11.172
Vote chris.

33:11.206 --> 33:14.758
Look, here's the deal, chris
Says leave open the possibility.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.241
That maybe we take wentworth out
Tonight.

33:17.275 --> 33:19.103
Did you already talk to her
About this?

33:19.137 --> 33:21.137
I talked to her first.

33:21.172 --> 33:22.344
I want to talk to you first.

33:22.379 --> 33:24.241
I don't want to bring david in.

33:24.275 --> 33:26.517
I don't want to bring wendy in.

33:26.551 --> 33:29.620
If you're in, we both talk to
Lauren and make it happen and.

33:29.655 --> 33:31.689
Take one of the big threats out
Of this game.

33:31.724 --> 33:33.137
Crap.

33:33.172 --> 33:36.551
War dog wants to get chris out,
Because chris is going after.

33:36.586 --> 33:38.482
Kelley which I'm like

33:38.517 --> 33:41.034
I'm glad he doesn't know I've
Been going after kelley.

33:41.068 --> 33:43.206
It would be you, me, lauren and
Kelley?

33:43.241 --> 33:44.482
Yeah, four-three.

33:44.517 --> 33:47.482
I don't want to alienate
David because, like, I do think.

33:47.517 --> 33:48.689
He's a number for you and I.

33:48.724 --> 33:52.310
If you're in with this plan,
I'm in with you talking to

33:52.344 --> 33:53.344
David.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.000
I've been waiting all game to
Make a big move.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.758
Apparently today is the day for
Big moves.

33:57.793 --> 34:00.689
It sucks because now it's all
Coming to a head, and I'm.

34:00.724 --> 34:04.517
Getting pushed into a corner
Where I'm gog have to betray.

34:04.551 --> 34:05.000
Someone.

34:05.034 --> 34:05.724
I'm a villain now.

34:05.758 --> 34:09.516
I've been turned into a villain.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.793
She wasn't ever supposed to
Know her name was coming up.

34:14.827 --> 34:15.757
And now she does.

34:15.793 --> 34:16.931
So... >> he played himself.

34:16.965 --> 34:19.447
We weren't going to approach
Wardog.

34:19.482 --> 34:20.827
We have a lot to talk about.

34:20.862 --> 34:24.034
My god, now it looks like
Wendy isn't even an option to.

34:24.068 --> 34:27.620
Vote for anymore, which was a
Simple vote.

34:27.655 --> 34:30.965
Now it's become a vote between
Wentworth and chris.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.068
It sounds like we have our Way.

34:33.103 --> 34:33.655
We do.

34:33.688 --> 34:34.931
What do you think?

34:34.965 --> 34:39.516
Wardog paint aid very pretty
Picture of kelley's loyalty.

34:39.551 --> 34:40.516
Here she comes.

34:40.551 --> 34:41.551
Yeah.

34:41.585 --> 34:43.516
Now rick and I find
Ourselveses in the middle.

34:43.551 --> 34:45.344
Whatever name rick and I land
On...

34:45.379 --> 34:47.447
I've been brought up to Speed.

34:47.482 --> 34:48.482
Okay.

34:48.516 --> 34:51.000
That is who should be
Going home tonight.

34:51.034 --> 34:53.482
David, I don't trust anybody.

34:53.516 --> 34:56.379
On one hand it's good to vote
For wentworth, because she's the.

34:56.413 --> 34:58.310
Person I least trust in this
Game.

34:58.344 --> 35:01.379
But funny thing is, if I vote
Chris out, no one in the game.

35:01.413 --> 35:04.517
Would know that I'm the one
Coming after wentworth.

35:04.551 --> 35:09.000
No matter what, tonight's tribal
Council is going to be huge.

35:09.034 --> 35:11.827
Secrets are going to get
Exposed.

35:11.862 --> 35:13.724
Betrails are going to get
Exposed.

35:13.758 --> 35:18.000
And I think nobody is gog view
Any of those betrails kindly or.

35:18.034 --> 35:20.310
Quietly.

35:47.965 --> 35:51.068
Watching at home how would you
Judge this tribe?

35:51.103 --> 35:52.344
Losers.

35:52.379 --> 35:56.034
We have three immunities and one
Win we end up with an injured.

35:56.068 --> 35:56.758
Player.

35:56.793 --> 35:59.551
Don't forget about the flint.

35:59.586 --> 36:01.551
We lost the flint in camp Today.

36:01.586 --> 36:03.172
And arguing over the Chickens.

36:03.206 --> 36:04.379
It was a disaster.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.182
Lauren, what was the
Argument about the chickens?

36:06.206 --> 36:10.275
Wendy decided that she would
Not eat a chicken if we killed.

36:10.310 --> 36:11.448
It.

36:11.482 --> 36:13.724
I mean, I didn't feel like it
Was much of an argument.

36:13.758 --> 36:16.241
It wasn't like, "I'm going to
Cause chaos if you guys kill a."

36:16.275 --> 36:17.482
Chicken."

36:17.517 --> 36:20.034
It was basically, "I don't feel
Comfortable."

36:20.068 --> 36:20.965
I'll step aside."

36:21.000 --> 36:25.275
Wardog, is that your Take on it?

36:25.310 --> 36:28.275
She eats chicken back home
With no problem.

36:28.310 --> 36:29.448
She said, you're right.

36:29.482 --> 36:30.344
I'm going to be a vegetarian
Now.

36:30.379 --> 36:31.172
How is that?

36:31.206 --> 36:33.206
It's almost like talking to
Myself.

36:33.241 --> 36:35.344
She has a lot of wardog in her.

36:35.379 --> 36:36.517
Warpup.

36:36.551 --> 36:39.482
Technically I have been
Vegetarian for eight days now,

36:39.517 --> 36:41.655
So I'm that stubborn.

36:41.689 --> 36:45.862
So, devens, when you
Lose one after another after.

36:45.896 --> 36:49.689
Another, there's a point where
It might just become I have to.

36:49.724 --> 36:50.793
Kick into game mode.

36:50.827 --> 36:54.034
I can't worry anymore about the
Tribe.

36:54.068 --> 36:57.620
The first two tribals was
Based on we need to get stronger.

36:57.655 --> 36:59.344
And it's not working.

36:59.379 --> 37:02.551
So you have to re-evaluate, and
I think a lot of people had that.

37:02.586 --> 37:04.517
Running through their minds
Today.

37:04.551 --> 37:06.551
Wentworth, did you
Feel a shift after today's loss,

37:06.586 --> 37:08.000
Three this a row.

37:08.034 --> 37:10.827
Something has to change.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.103
We're obviously doing
Something long and it's coming.

37:13.137 --> 37:14.310
Down to loyalty.

37:14.344 --> 37:15.769
As we get smaller and smaller
And that you recall, you're.

37:15.793 --> 37:18.068
Going to have to trust the
People you're with.

37:18.103 --> 37:21.206
David, it's an
Interesting ideal if a tribe.

37:21.241 --> 37:24.896
Were to give up on itself and
Lts ability to win, then.

37:24.931 --> 37:27.379
Somebody who is slowing you down
In challenges isn't as big a.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.620
Problem.

37:28.655 --> 37:31.448
Well, that's, I think,
Exactly what's going to happen.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.655
Tonight.

37:32.689 --> 37:35.448
So whether or not someone is a
Liability in a challenge is.

37:35.482 --> 37:36.689
Irrelevant.

37:36.724 --> 37:39.448
I think that tonight is really
About eliminating the biggest.

37:39.482 --> 37:41.034
Social threat.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.862
Wentworth, that
Seemed to get your attention.

37:43.896 --> 37:47.758
Yeah, I mean... there could be
Multiple plans going on.

37:47.793 --> 37:48.551
I'm not sure.

37:48.586 --> 37:49.827
Uhm...

37:49.862 --> 37:52.103
I rarely see you
Being unable to answer.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.310
I'm trying to process what
David said.

37:55.344 --> 37:59.482
Don't worry...
yeah, don't worry about it.

37:59.517 --> 38:01.275
He's just talking.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.044
Wardog, what do you make of
David's comments?

38:03.068 --> 38:06.586
A lot of his comments kind of
Throw me a little bit off.

38:06.620 --> 38:07.448
Balance, to be honest.

38:07.482 --> 38:09.034
I'm sticking to my plan.

38:09.068 --> 38:11.413
And I think cohesion is the best
Way forward.

38:11.448 --> 38:15.103
Wendy, when you hear
This comment from david, does it.

38:15.137 --> 38:18.931
Make gu, "Maybe there's more
Game afoot?"

38:18.965 --> 38:23.241
honestly, whatever happens in
Tribal council, I always feel.

38:23.275 --> 38:25.965
Like the tribe is a pyramid of
Different layers and I'm right.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.034
At the bottom.

38:27.068 --> 38:29.044
I'm just extracting all my
Information from what's.

38:29.068 --> 38:29.551
Happening right now.

38:29.586 --> 38:31.379
Wow.

38:31.413 --> 38:33.000
Devens, this is fascinating!

38:33.034 --> 38:36.551
A tribe that seems to have
Nothing going on but loss after.

38:36.586 --> 38:41.275
Loss after loss right now seems
To be playing a very complex,

38:41.310 --> 38:42.965
Layered game, only eight days
In.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.551
I hope this can be our
Advantage because kama hasn't.

38:47.586 --> 38:50.724
Done any of this, and we have
Three days of pure strategy.

38:50.758 --> 38:53.275
Under our belt right now so
We're playing a much more.

38:53.310 --> 38:54.586
Developed game.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.734
I think just coming out here,
You don't realize how good these.

38:56.758 --> 38:57.517
Players are.

38:57.551 --> 38:59.724
Like, these are real
Conversations.

38:59.758 --> 39:00.769
These are real relationships.

39:00.793 --> 39:01.862
These are real people.

39:01.896 --> 39:09.310
And that's something that you
Can't feel back home.

39:09.344 --> 39:12.034
All right, it is time To vote.

39:12.068 --> 39:15.068
Lauren, you're up.

39:47.172 --> 39:50.172
I'll go tally the Votes.

39:58.379 --> 40:01.034
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you.

40:01.068 --> 40:07.034
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

40:07.068 --> 40:07.793
Okay.

40:07.827 --> 40:12.034
I'll read the votes.

40:12.068 --> 40:13.413
First vote,

40:13.448 --> 40:17.724
Wentworth.

40:17.758 --> 40:22.620
Chris.

40:22.655 --> 40:23.482
Wentworth.

40:23.517 --> 40:27.034
That's two votes wentworth.

40:27.068 --> 40:28.068
Chris.

40:28.103 --> 40:36.103
We're tied, two votes wentworth,
Two votes chris.

40:37.206 --> 40:38.172
Chris.

40:38.206 --> 40:45.586
That's three votes chris, two
Votes wentworth.

40:45.620 --> 40:48.413
Third person voted out of
"Survivor,"

40:48.448 --> 40:48.793
Chris.

40:48.827 --> 40:49.206
That's four.

40:49.241 --> 40:49.931
That's enough.

40:49.965 --> 40:56.275
You need to bring me your torch.

41:05.448 --> 41:09.068
Chris, the tribe has Spoken.

41:09.103 --> 41:17.103
Time for you to go.

41:19.137 --> 41:25.655
Time for you to go.

41:38.068 --> 41:43.034
Screw those guys. I'm getting
Back in the boat.

From our next episode.

42:12.241 --> 42:14.793
Next time on "Survivor"

42:14.827 --> 42:18.000
You can fly the coop...
I finally did my plan of.

42:18.034 --> 42:19.482
Releasing the chickens!

42:19.517 --> 42:21.517
But you can't escape A twist.

42:21.551 --> 42:24.517
Everybody, drop your buffs.

42:24.551 --> 42:26.551
Now we have to cannibalize
Ourselves.

42:26.586 --> 42:30.413
We are switching from
Two tribes to three tribes.

42:30.448 --> 42:31.965
It's a whole new dynamic now.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I just got lied to my face.

42:34.034 --> 42:36.517
Tomorrow it's going to be
Motivation and refocus.

42:36.551 --> 42:37.551
Tonight it's painful.

42:37.586 --> 42:39.586
Something in my stomach hurts.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.344
I didn't see the blindside
Coming.

42:41.379 --> 42:44.862
This is a blindside inside of a
Blindside but it's a redeeming.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.137
Blindside.

42:46.172 --> 42:48.079
I've been given a second chance
And I'm going to mieskt of it.

42:48.103 --> 42:49.241
