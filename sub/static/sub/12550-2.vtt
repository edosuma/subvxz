01:25.960 --> 01:27.680
Run!

01:33.680 --> 01:36.280
Come on, boy.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.040
Don't you want a closer look?

01:40.359 --> 01:42.320
Ya-aa-aah!

01:44.840 --> 01:46.799
Good sense of smell, have you?

01:46.799 --> 01:49.879
Oh, yes...best nostrils
in the galaxy, official!

01:49.879 --> 01:52.120
And you like my perfume? Lovely.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.839
Then sniff this!
SHE SQUEALS

02:02.280 --> 02:03.759
SQUEALING CONTINUES

02:07.120 --> 02:08.919
I've found a secret room! Not now.

02:10.559 --> 02:12.280
Get it open!

02:12.280 --> 02:15.479
It's locked! That thing's real,
isn't it? It's real...

02:15.479 --> 02:17.280
This place is sealed!
You're finished!

02:17.280 --> 02:20.440
- Right here, right now!
- This way!

02:20.440 --> 02:23.559
LAUGHING AND GROWLING

02:23.559 --> 02:25.880
Maria! Come on!

02:25.880 --> 02:27.640
Maria!

02:32.039 --> 02:36.080
Luke! Sarah Jane.
I was wrong, it is aliens.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.560
Yeah, I know! Raaagh!

02:38.560 --> 02:39.640
Right, listen...

02:39.640 --> 02:42.800
She said make a smell, make a big
enough smell and you'll get away!

02:42.800 --> 02:45.880
What'll we do, fart our way out?
Would that be funny? What?!

02:45.880 --> 02:48.160
Come out, little ones...

02:48.160 --> 02:51.479
They're nearby, Daddy.
I can smell you.

02:51.479 --> 02:54.320
A strong smell, think! A skunk?

02:54.320 --> 02:56.960
Yes! Wolverine.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.639
Pure masculine action. Yaaarggh!

03:01.880 --> 03:03.959
COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING

03:06.040 --> 03:07.680
Go, go, go!

03:12.760 --> 03:16.840
COUGHING

03:16.840 --> 03:18.919
Hunt them.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.920
GROWLING

03:23.920 --> 03:28.200
Wait for me! Sarah Jane! Come on,
Sarah Jane!

03:28.200 --> 03:30.680
ZAPPING NOISES
Sarah Jane, please! Sarah Jane!

03:32.960 --> 03:34.040
Into the car!

03:34.040 --> 03:35.559
Come on, hurry!

03:38.120 --> 03:41.960
What's that? Sonic lipstick.
Of course. What is he doing here?

03:41.960 --> 03:45.640
Sorry. Somebody else's life in
my hands, just what I needed!

03:48.560 --> 03:51.039
They're getting away.

03:51.039 --> 03:53.160
That's not fair, Daddy!

03:53.160 --> 03:56.279
That woman cheated!
I want my hunt! Come here...

03:56.279 --> 03:59.680
That woman had some
sort of sonic disruptor.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.119
This is a level five planet,
they're primitives.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.440
How did she get that? Who is she?

04:05.440 --> 04:09.359
The galactic police?
She could be one of their agents.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.759
No, she's human, she smelt...

04:11.759 --> 04:13.720
soupy, they all do.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.360
Still, if that's her only weapon,
she's no big deal.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.959
Daddy. I want my hunt!

04:18.959 --> 04:21.478
You'll have your
hunt later, I promise.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.399
Tonight's the night
the lights go out!

04:24.399 --> 04:26.680
THEY ALL LAUGH

04:27.320 --> 04:29.519
I want answers.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.159
I've just been chased by aliens and
you aren't even freaking out. Why?

04:33.159 --> 04:37.840
Who are you? You've gotta go home,
forget this ever happened. Go home!

04:37.840 --> 04:40.319
No. I'm part of this, I
want to find out the truth.

04:40.319 --> 04:43.000
What's in there
and who's that woman?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.639
Just leave us alone, OK?

04:44.639 --> 04:47.999
The police won't leave you alone,
when I tell 'em what happened.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
Show me!

04:49.999 --> 04:52.039
OK!

04:52.039 --> 04:55.040
At last.
We've waited so long for this moment.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.839
Times have been hard.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.159
They've been closing in on us from
all sides.

04:59.159 --> 05:02.000
Judoon, forcing us out,
the other families against us.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.800
This will give us a new beginning.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.799
Wealth, security.

05:05.799 --> 05:08.040
When we have the money, what then?

05:08.040 --> 05:10.279
We'll buy a fleet of battle cruisers.

05:10.279 --> 05:13.839
Return home
to Raxacoricofallapatorius.

05:13.839 --> 05:17.280
I shall smite the Grand Council,
crush the Senate.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.840
The Blathereen and the Hostrozeen
will beg for mercy at my feet!

05:22.400 --> 05:25.079
But we mustn't get carried away.

05:25.079 --> 05:29.800
First things first. We have the
equation, nothing can stop us.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.399
Now it begins!

05:31.399 --> 05:34.799
The inhabitants of Raxa...Raxa...
Oh!

05:34.799 --> 05:37.280
Raxacoricofallapatorius.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.519
The outcast Slitheen Family are
scavengers, thieves of technology,

05:41.519 --> 05:44.399
known to infiltrate low-tech planets
by hiding in the skins

05:44.399 --> 05:46.720
of the dominant native species.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.039
Slitheen in Downing Street. What?

05:50.039 --> 05:51.800
Something a friend said once.

05:51.800 --> 05:56.240
Gas exchange from skin
compression often results in...

05:56.240 --> 05:59.479
Farting. Farting's funny.
Right, what's going on in here?

05:59.479 --> 06:02.080
Why don't you bring round
the whole school?

06:02.080 --> 06:04.800
If he tells anyone
who's gonna believe him? Wait,

06:04.800 --> 06:08.119
I've had monsters from space on me
and no-one tells me what's going on.

06:08.119 --> 06:11.880
Shut up for the minute, I'm
busy and you're not important.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.799
Even if it is getting like
Clapham Junction up here. Right.

06:14.799 --> 06:17.519
The Slitheen have taken
over Coldfire Construction.

06:17.519 --> 06:19.799
Put up buildings all
around the world. Why?

06:19.799 --> 06:23.439
I think know. There's a hidden
room in the school, I saw inside.

06:23.439 --> 06:26.999
What's in there? I've got a theory,
Mr Smith could help.

06:26.999 --> 06:29.600
Who's that, your dad?
Mr Smith, I need you!

06:42.479 --> 06:44.800
'Good afternoon, Sarah Jane.'

06:44.800 --> 06:47.040
Oh, yes! Is that a computer?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.559
'Who's that?' Nobody.
Mr Smith, Luke would like some help.

06:49.559 --> 06:52.919
'Certainly. Hello, Luke.'
Hello, Mr Smith.

06:52.919 --> 06:55.160
Bring up our satellite
image of London.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.120
Now plot the positions of every
school put up by Coldfire.

07:03.559 --> 07:06.040
Ealing, that's us.
St Cheldon's Comp, Upminster.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.679
Schools at Epping,
Amersham, Richmond, Morden...

07:08.679 --> 07:12.040
The ends of tube lines -
if I'm allowed to speak.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.760
This is real, all of it's real!

07:13.760 --> 07:19.040
The talking computer's real,
the Slitheens are real. Oh, yes!

07:19.040 --> 07:23.079
Mr Smith, plot the position of
every Coldfire building put up

07:23.079 --> 07:25.439
in the last 18 months in the world.

07:25.439 --> 07:29.479
'Accessing...'
Paris, Sydney, Beijing.

07:29.479 --> 07:32.680
Not all capital cities, they're
spread out all over the place.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.159
They look pretty random.

07:34.159 --> 07:38.200
Wait. Underground railways - they've
all got underground railways!

07:38.200 --> 07:39.880
Don't have to thank me. Link them.

07:41.879 --> 07:47.840
London, Barcelona, Washington DC,
Santiago, Los Angeles, Sydney,

07:47.840 --> 07:50.880
Beijing, Moscow, Naples, Paris.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.600
There's a Slitheen at every site.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.480
And there are ten cities, ten sites.
Right, call the army.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.000
Oh, right, cos that always
makes things better.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.280
It's not your job. There's a
cleverer way of going about things.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.480
But what's it all for,
what are they doing?

08:04.480 --> 08:06.680
Secret room, what was in there?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.960
Sarah Jane.
I've done something really stupid.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.119
A really bad social mistake.

08:12.119 --> 08:14.999
I told the Slitheen how
to destroy the world.

08:19.439 --> 08:23.759
I've input the boy's catalyst
equation. Now it works perfectly!

08:23.759 --> 08:26.200
We'll take the night side first,

08:26.200 --> 08:29.960
build up the charge, section
by section. And then...

08:32.759 --> 08:38.919
This is Glune Fex Fize Sharleveer
Slam Slitheen to all Slitheen units.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.759
Is everybody ready?

08:41.759 --> 08:44.440
It wasn't working until
I gave them the answers.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.599
Oh, Luke... The power cut
last night was a test run.

08:48.599 --> 08:51.520
But our candles went out
and that's not electric.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.119
'When the capacitors are charged up
they act as transducers,

08:55.119 --> 08:58.600
'converting heat and light
into electrical energy.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.119
'That's how the loop works,
it's not connected physically.'

09:02.119 --> 09:04.720
What has underground
railways got to do with that?

09:04.720 --> 09:08.639
The system generates enormous heat.
They act as a cooling system!

09:08.639 --> 09:11.600
Glad we sorted that out. People
getting ill, food going off,

09:11.600 --> 09:14.120
that's the effect of being
next to the capacitors.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.000
'Indeed. Even on standby,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.520
'the transducers would cause
cellular decay in organic matter.'

09:19.520 --> 09:21.160
With this system they can drain

09:21.160 --> 09:24.440
energy from the Earth. Our school's
the last link in the chain.

09:24.440 --> 09:30.199
But - it needs the whole chain to do
that? Yeah. We bomb the school?

09:30.199 --> 09:33.440
If we get in, could you destroy
the system safely? I think so.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.160
If we reset the system, shut it
down. I'd need a cutting tool.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.760
What about this?

09:39.760 --> 09:43.439
Yeah, and how do we get past
the Slitheen? We bomb them!

09:43.439 --> 09:47.600
'Sarah Jane. I've just picked up this
report on an American news channel.'

09:47.600 --> 09:49.760
Breaking news...

09:49.760 --> 09:54.199
there's a massive loss of power on
the west coast of North America.

09:54.199 --> 09:56.399
Los Angeles has gone dark.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.199
It's starting...

09:58.199 --> 10:00.160
And I told them how to do it.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.039
The day I was born
I saved the world.

10:02.039 --> 10:04.040
Now I've helped to destroy it.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.720
It works!
Section one down, grazie, Napoli!

10:08.720 --> 10:10.759
Thank you. Moving to Section two.

10:10.759 --> 10:12.440
Hello, Washington DC!

10:12.440 --> 10:14.440
Howdy, London!

10:14.440 --> 10:18.680
Connect! Mr Smith. Give me everything
you've got on the inhabitants of...

10:18.680 --> 10:20.999
Raxacoricofallapatorius.
You're making that up.

10:20.999 --> 10:24.959
Any weaknesses, anything we can
use to fight them. 'Accessing.'

10:24.959 --> 10:28.600
Anybody could have made that mistake.
No, only he could. Clyde!

10:28.600 --> 10:30.959
Duh! Let's have a High School
Musical moment,

10:30.959 --> 10:32.199
a group hug'll sort it.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.360
You're right, as if a teacher
could have worked out that diagram.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.200
And the power loss is
spreading westwards.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.280
China is now without power.

10:40.280 --> 10:44.960
It may be only a matter of time
before the effect spreads here.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.999
Oh, boy...

10:48.999 --> 10:52.400
'I have lost the signal.'
Anything on the Slitheen yet?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.720
'Accessing.'

10:54.720 --> 10:56.199
Come on!

10:58.440 --> 11:00.640
Section nine clear...

11:00.640 --> 11:03.160
Dormez bien, Paris!

11:03.160 --> 11:06.320
That makes us next.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.520
So synchronize the mega-wattage.
Er...

11:09.520 --> 11:12.800
Oh, for the love of Clom!

11:18.880 --> 11:21.080
Mr Smith does like to take his time.

11:22.679 --> 11:24.119
Come on.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.199
'Raxacoricofallapatorians.
Calcium-based life-forms.'

11:30.199 --> 11:32.600
Give us the weaknesses!
'Weaknesses.'

11:32.600 --> 11:34.319
'They are a naturally hardy race.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.080
'However, their bodies are
notoriously hyper-sensitive to...'

11:38.080 --> 11:39.559
No!

11:41.359 --> 11:47.480
The Prime Minister has promised the
blackouts will not affect the UK.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.359
Thank you, Prime Minister.

11:49.359 --> 11:51.320
We can't stop them without this.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.879
It's real. The end of the world.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.279
Thanks to him. Will you shut up!

11:56.279 --> 11:58.959
No Mr Smith. No sonic lipstick.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.280
No Plan B.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.319
But we are the only people in
the world who can stop this.

12:05.319 --> 12:08.559
And we will.

12:08.559 --> 12:12.080
Time to go back to school!

12:12.080 --> 12:14.480
Without the sonic thing we can't
stop them!

12:14.480 --> 12:16.840
Plus they'll get us
before we even reach...

12:16.840 --> 12:19.360
If you can't say
anything useful, go home!

12:19.360 --> 12:21.719
Wait! This morning,
the Slitheen Jeffrey,

12:21.719 --> 12:23.639
he went mad when he nicked my bag.

12:23.639 --> 12:25.800
So? What's a Slitheen
gonna care about that?

12:25.800 --> 12:29.120
You saw him, he sniffed it, he was
scared! What was in that bag?

12:29.120 --> 12:32.560
My books, some Tangfastics, and
my lunch. What was in your lunch?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.640
Cold chip sandwich. I made it.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.599
I wasn't eating from
the canteen of death.

12:36.599 --> 12:39.200
What? They're allergic
to potato? Bread? Butter?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.479
No, the Slitheen in the office,
ate a sandwich.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.399
What was on the chips?
Salt and vinegar.

12:43.399 --> 12:46.679
Salt! Must be it. If the Slitheen
are made mostly of water,

12:46.679 --> 12:48.719
it would dehydrate them, like slugs.

12:48.719 --> 12:51.400
No, they put extra salt in
everything, bread, butter,

12:51.400 --> 12:52.960
it's something else...

12:52.960 --> 12:56.160
It's gotta be the vinegar!
Vinegar, that's acetic acid.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.600
It reacts with calcium.
They're made of calcium!

12:58.600 --> 13:01.720
I'm right. It's the vinegar!
Kitchen!

13:01.720 --> 13:03.560
So what're we gonna do,

13:03.560 --> 13:07.319
just stand there and throw
pickled eggs at them?

13:07.319 --> 13:08.879
Get it all into these.

13:08.879 --> 13:12.920
I was joking. The car's not gonna
start, how do we get back to school?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.639
We run!

13:16.720 --> 13:22.199
The capacitors are charged! Time for
the coup de grace. The denouement.

13:22.199 --> 13:24.479
Daddy. You promised I could do it.

13:24.479 --> 13:27.559
It's appropriate, don't you think?

13:27.559 --> 13:29.999
We are doing this for our children.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.279
Yes.

13:32.279 --> 13:37.240
A new beginning
for a new generation of Slitheen.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.320
Go ahead, lad.

13:41.839 --> 13:44.160
Turn out the sun...

13:44.160 --> 13:47.560
WHIRRING

13:47.560 --> 13:50.840
It just stopped,
engine's dead, they're all dead.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.800
So all this fighting aliens stuff,

13:52.800 --> 13:55.160
you've been doing
it for years? Not now, Clyde.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.719
Did you go up to the
career guy at school and say,

13:57.719 --> 14:00.640
"I wanna defend the planet from
alien invaders?" Not exactly.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.440
So how did it start?

14:02.440 --> 14:05.319
It's a long story. If we survive,
I'll be happy to tell you.

14:05.319 --> 14:07.319
WHOOSH!

14:07.319 --> 14:10.319
What's going on?
It's transduction, like the candles.

14:10.319 --> 14:12.760
They've switched off the sun!
They're draining it.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.920
It's getting cold.
We've got about 32.5 minutes.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.119
Everyone's gonna die. I told you!
We're going to stop them!

14:19.119 --> 14:20.640
What? The four of us?

14:20.640 --> 14:22.519
With vinegar in plastic squeezies?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.359
Alan, where's Maria?
She's at her mate's, I think.

14:30.359 --> 14:32.839
You think?
This is the end of the world!

14:32.839 --> 14:35.320
It's a power cut, Chrissie,
it was on the news.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.519
The nights are drawing in and you
think it's the end of the world.

14:38.519 --> 14:40.559
Look! The sun's blue, it's freezing!

14:40.559 --> 14:42.639
Where is Maria, where is she?

14:46.280 --> 14:47.480
Daddy, she's come back!

14:47.480 --> 14:50.360
So what? She's an old woman with a
funny lipstick. End of.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.520
My hunt! Ah-ah!

14:54.520 --> 14:57.080
I think an adult'd
better deal with them this time.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.959
HE CHORTLES

15:05.120 --> 15:06.720
They just let us walk in here!

15:06.720 --> 15:10.439
They want us here. Well, what luck,
because we want to be in here.

15:10.439 --> 15:12.280
The secret room? It's this way...

15:12.280 --> 15:18.760
Ah, human children, the stench
of Haribo and chicken nuggets.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.039
Get off this planet! Shush now.

15:21.039 --> 15:25.000
It's time to hunt.
The hunt is an instinct with us.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.880
The only way to keep
our food safe in the days

15:27.880 --> 15:30.839
when the Baaraddelskelliumfatrexius
beasts

15:30.839 --> 15:34.720
wandered the plains of
Raxacoricofallapatorius. The what?

15:34.720 --> 15:38.120
Sort of like giant squirrels.
We killed them all centuries ago.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.439
But the hunting instinct remains!

15:40.439 --> 15:42.040
Now! Yaaargh!

15:42.040 --> 15:44.759
Didn't like that, did you? Vinegar!

15:44.759 --> 15:46.640
Get back!
Sarah Jane, this way! Maria?

15:46.640 --> 15:48.959
It's working.
We're doing our bit, you do yours!

15:48.959 --> 15:50.480
One step further...

15:52.559 --> 15:55.040
RAA-AA-AARGH! Keep back!

15:55.040 --> 15:57.199
HE GROWLS

15:57.199 --> 15:58.679
You're afraid.

15:58.679 --> 16:01.439
A Slitheen girl your age would do
it, wouldn't think twice.

16:01.439 --> 16:03.759
But all the fight's gone out of you.

16:03.759 --> 16:06.560
You just stand there
shaking in your shoes.

16:06.560 --> 16:11.200
That's why we survive,
that's why you're losers.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.279
All of you on this rubbish planet.

16:14.279 --> 16:16.840
That's why we win! Argh!

16:17.440 --> 16:21.200
HE SCREAMS

16:21.200 --> 16:22.400
Oops.

16:27.079 --> 16:28.719
Oh, great.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.040
I did it!

16:32.040 --> 16:34.199
I exploded the Headmaster.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.560
WAILING

16:38.560 --> 16:41.440
One of the Family...
something's wrong!

16:41.440 --> 16:43.679
Daddy, look!

16:43.679 --> 16:47.279
It's Glune, he's been vinegared!

16:49.199 --> 16:53.440
This is Kist Magg Thek Lutovin Day
Slitheen calling the Family,

16:53.440 --> 16:54.880
we are under attack.

16:54.880 --> 17:01.079
Glune Fex Fize is dead. Emergency
Plan A, all operators here, now!

17:01.079 --> 17:02.319
Daddy!

17:02.319 --> 17:04.720
Everything's going to be all right.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.079
They're here.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.480
In here.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.679
And so are our uninvited guests!

17:19.679 --> 17:22.239
Behold, the capacitor!

17:22.239 --> 17:25.358
We drain the energy
into these and store it.

17:25.358 --> 17:28.600
In ten minutes this planet's
atmosphere gets snatched away,

17:28.600 --> 17:31.640
but we'll be safe and warm in here.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.120
And then a spacecraft picks us up.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.119
And we sell everything we've
collected. Why are you doing this?

17:38.119 --> 17:41.600
The Family came here once before,
just a routine job,

17:41.600 --> 17:43.280
but they never came back.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.640
I think I might know what happened.
Who happened.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.040
This planet will pay in blood!

17:48.040 --> 17:51.440
They were our Family!
And Luke is mine!

17:51.440 --> 17:53.160
This will give us a new beginning!

17:53.160 --> 17:56.839
My son won't have to live like I've
had to, cringing in the darkness.

17:56.839 --> 18:01.520
And I want my son to live, to grow
up. I want what's best for him!

18:01.520 --> 18:04.640
Your stupid son gave us
what we needed.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.680
I didn't! What?

18:06.680 --> 18:09.000
I thought I did, but I didn't.
You made the mistake.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.200
When you showed me the diagram,

18:11.200 --> 18:15.400
you didn't tell me that you'd steal
power from the sun... It'll explode.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.120
It's a bluff! What's a bluff?

18:17.120 --> 18:20.759
Florm? Well, the boy might be right.
CRASH!

18:20.759 --> 18:22.360
It's happening. Turn it off!

18:22.360 --> 18:24.160
You heard her, turn it off!

18:24.160 --> 18:26.999
There's vinegar in this! Water!

18:26.999 --> 18:29.759
That's a bluff.

18:29.759 --> 18:31.679
I knew that wouldn't work.

18:31.679 --> 18:36.239
If I reset the system, you can
cancel the overload, make it safe?

18:37.760 --> 18:41.519
Yes! Right. Son, reset the system!

18:58.760 --> 19:00.879
It's reset. The system's off.

19:00.879 --> 19:04.880
Now I'll just have to synchronise
the mega-wattage. Now!

19:05.999 --> 19:07.439
Daddy!

19:07.439 --> 19:09.200
Mum!

19:09.200 --> 19:11.320
Yaaargh! Luke!

19:19.600 --> 19:22.160
EVERYONE SHOUTS AT ONCE

19:23.600 --> 19:25.199
HE GROWLS
Aa-aa-aah!

19:27.199 --> 19:29.600
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING

19:36.199 --> 19:38.600
SCREAMING

19:38.600 --> 19:42.160
It's going to blow up! Out now!

19:42.160 --> 19:47.759
It's out of control! Wait for me!

19:53.360 --> 19:55.799
Resynchronize the mega-wattage!

19:55.799 --> 19:59.480
Quickly,
we've got to get out of here!

20:02.480 --> 20:05.599
You can't leave us in here!
Use your sonic device,

20:05.599 --> 20:08.840
open the door. Open the door!
I'm only 12!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.599
He's my son!

20:11.599 --> 20:14.200
Please, let him live.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.800
Luke.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.960
You can't let them out!

20:18.880 --> 20:22.400
SCREAMING

20:29.160 --> 20:31.399
It's burnt itself out.

20:31.399 --> 20:34.920
We did it!
He was a child. 12 years old.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.560
It was them or us!

20:40.079 --> 20:42.760
Some of the Slitheen got away,
I saw them vanish.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.200
Their machine's useless now.
We broke the chain.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.400
Except there's buildings
round the world

20:47.400 --> 20:49.440
with secret rooms
and alien machinery.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.520
Bye now, love to the Brig!

20:51.520 --> 20:55.080
Just sorted that. Some friends of
mine are going to clear it all up.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.360
Friends from UNIT? Uh-huh.
What's UNIT, a furniture shop?

20:58.360 --> 21:00.440
Where were you? Come here!

21:00.440 --> 21:02.999
Oh, where've you been?

21:02.999 --> 21:05.960
We just went up town,
grabbed some burgers.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.560
The power went off, I was so
worried! Now it's back on.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.760
Oh, Sally Anne, bless you,
for looking after my Maria.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.320
My head was full of things
that could've happened.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.840
OK, where've you really been?

21:16.840 --> 21:19.119
What d'you mean?
Such a useless liar.

21:19.119 --> 21:20.800
Shut up, Alan.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.799
Did you see the sun? It went blue!

21:22.799 --> 21:25.919
I mean I've heard of a blue
moon, that's quite romantic

21:25.919 --> 21:27.759
but it was terrifying.

21:29.279 --> 21:31.599
I was just gonna make tea,
are you staying?

21:31.599 --> 21:35.720
Em, don't tell me, Tuesday,
Spanish omelette.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.839
As it happens. So predictable.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.999
Go on then, twist my arm. Just
this once, I'll suffer your cooking.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.919
That's brilliant! Oh, sweetheart.

21:43.919 --> 21:46.880
I may not live here,
but I'm still looking after you.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.240
Right, cos I'm so useless. You are!
The sun went out and you lost her!

21:50.240 --> 21:52.200
She was off
gallivanting with Suzie Q!

21:52.200 --> 21:55.160
Sarah Jane, her name is Sarah Jane.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.440
Whatever, Sarah Jane.

21:59.239 --> 22:01.799
Tell you what, though.

22:01.799 --> 22:04.640
Funny things have been happening
since you moved in here.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.319
I'm beginning to get suspicious.

22:06.319 --> 22:08.520
Suspicious of what?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.319
Well, think about it, right.

22:10.319 --> 22:13.679
You move in, opposite Sarah Jane
and everyone turns into zombies.

22:13.679 --> 22:16.480
Then you're with Sarah Jane
and the pop factory blows up.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.399
Then you run off with Sarah Jane
and the sun goes out.

22:19.399 --> 22:22.440
Just ask yourself what have
those things got in common?

22:22.440 --> 22:25.400
Or rather,
who have they got in common? Eh?

22:25.400 --> 22:28.160
I don't know. Me.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.080
It's all happening to me!

22:30.080 --> 22:34.720
I just can't move for disasters,
it's like I'm cursed!

22:38.159 --> 22:40.120
What's that for, sweetheart?

22:40.120 --> 22:41.640
It's cos you're cursed!

22:44.240 --> 22:46.199
Here's your reward,

22:46.199 --> 22:48.239
a nice cuppa.

22:48.239 --> 22:51.360
Oh, d'you mind? Just make sure
you put that back where it belongs.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.519
Is this from outer space?

22:53.519 --> 22:55.080
No, Venezuela.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.080
You ask too many questions, Clyde.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.279
Too late to stop me now.

22:59.279 --> 23:00.879
I suppose.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.080
That's how I got started,
asking questions.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.399
But you never told me.

23:05.399 --> 23:08.480
How did you discover all
this stuff, aliens and things?

23:08.480 --> 23:11.680
I met this man called the Doctor.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.359
He was an alien, too.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.920
What, like a big green thing?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.640
No, he looked just like you and me.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.799
Except he was nothing like
you and me.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.080
He took me out into space
far away from Earth.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.640
You travelled through space?

23:24.640 --> 23:28.919
And time. I saw planets and galaxies
and all sorts of creatures,

23:28.919 --> 23:31.200
things you would never imagine.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.520
So where is he now, then,
this Doctor?

23:33.520 --> 23:36.800
Still out there. Still wandering.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.960
Still wonderful.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.120
And he left me behind
with his legacy, I suppose.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.040
To help and to protect.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.079
To make a stand
and to never give up.

23:47.079 --> 23:52.000
He sounds cool. Cool? Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.120
So, are you gonna see him again?

23:54.120 --> 23:55.599
I hope so.

23:56.559 --> 23:59.680
The thing is, Clyde, you can't
tell anyone about these things.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.280
It's got to be our secret.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.079
Can I trust you? Yeah.

24:04.079 --> 24:06.880
Promise. Thank you.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.600
Sarah Jane, Maria's here. Coming!

24:09.600 --> 24:13.120
He's gone back to calling you
Sarah Jane. It should be Mum!

24:13.120 --> 24:14.720
D'you think?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.400
Yeah, tell him.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.600
Yeah, I don't know how.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.280
'Diagnostic checks completed.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.520
'All systems are functioning
normally.'

24:35.520 --> 24:38.519
All right, while they're downstairs,
where are you from?

24:38.519 --> 24:41.760
'All systems are functioning
normally.' Who built you?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.679
'All systems are functioning
normally.

24:44.679 --> 24:47.119
'Beware your curiosity, boy.'
ZAP!

24:47.119 --> 24:49.679
MR SMITH CHUCKLES
Freak weather conditions?

24:49.679 --> 24:53.160
Temporary reversals of the Earth's
magnetic poles? That's the one.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.800
Mr Smith, start a rumour.

24:54.800 --> 24:59.159
Insert the words "temporary reversal
of the Earth's magnetic poles"

24:59.159 --> 25:01.000
into media reports. 'Confirmed.'

25:01.000 --> 25:03.080
Can't believe we can't tell anyone.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.600
I should get millions
for what I did today.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.480
We all did it.
But who worked out the vinegar?

25:08.480 --> 25:11.079
Thank you, Clyde Langer!

25:11.079 --> 25:12.800
I'll walk you to the bus stop.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.480
You're right.
This is great. Weird, but great.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.799
And you lot need me. Can't believe
you were gonna save those Slitheen.

25:19.799 --> 25:23.840
They tried to destroy the entire
planet, billions of people,

25:23.840 --> 25:25.639
what was the big dilemma?

25:25.639 --> 25:27.360
Bus stop.

25:28.919 --> 25:31.520
You were good...

25:31.520 --> 25:34.640
and if anyone says you're
not cool, I'll set 'em right.

25:37.720 --> 25:42.280
He's right. Ah, you were amazing.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.160
Again.
I nearly destroyed everything.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.360
I messed up. I messed up.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.159
New block, the strangeness of it...

25:50.159 --> 25:52.079
of all people,
I should have seen it.

25:52.079 --> 25:54.639
Instead, oh,
I sent you and Maria right in there

25:54.639 --> 25:56.480
and that was nearly the end of you.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.639
But I'm still here.
Always will be...

25:59.639 --> 26:01.280
Mum.

26:23.639 --> 26:27.240
The Lavender Lawns rest home is
apparently being haunted by a nun.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.640
Help me. Doesn't Mr Smith believe
in ghosts? And neither do I.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.880
When weirdo nuns turn up
on your doorstep

26:33.880 --> 26:36.680
asking about freaky,
glowing alien gizmos.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.880
One thing you never do,
is tell them you've got one.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.840
The talisman is dangerous?
More than you can imagine.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.760
No, wait. Luke!

26:43.760 --> 26:46.479
The Abbess will want to see you.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.440
The Abbess?
Luke, he's been nabbed by a nun.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.360
Really? Protecting a gorgon here?

26:51.360 --> 26:54.680
A creature
with writhing serpents for hair.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.679
The sisters, they protect her.

26:58.679 --> 27:01.679
Look on the face of the
gorgon and feel your flesh

27:01.679 --> 27:02.799
turn to stone.

27:02.799 --> 27:04.039
SCREAMING

27:13.079 --> 27:16.119
