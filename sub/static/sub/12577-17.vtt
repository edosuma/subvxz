00:32.000 --> 00:33.267
yep.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.267
yep.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.667
yep.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.433
What's with hank?

00:40.500 --> 00:43.033
Why, I think he's worried
about his mom.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.600
Are you worried
about your mom, hank?

00:46.667 --> 00:48.933
He's worried
about his mom.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.867
( sighing ):
she and her friends

00:50.933 --> 00:53.267
were supposed to get
here two hours ago.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.833
Why she had
to take on

00:54.900 --> 00:57.267
all this highway
driving at her age

00:57.333 --> 01:00.067
just to see a museum
of miniatures...

01:00.067 --> 01:01.933
Oh! The one
at port aransas?

01:02.067 --> 01:03.667
( exasperated sigh ):
yes.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.467
well, maybe she stopped
on the way

01:05.533 --> 01:06.933
to make herself look nice.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.833
That's something ladies do.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.667
I was married
to one once.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.367
( sighs )

01:19.067 --> 01:20.933
my god, it's
almost 4:00.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.567
Would it cheer you up

01:22.633 --> 01:25.333
if I stuffed some fig newtons
up my nose?

01:25.400 --> 01:27.067
Aah...

01:28.300 --> 01:29.767
Mom, you made it.

01:29.833 --> 01:32.167
You know, you've still
got four hours of driving

01:32.233 --> 01:33.933
before you get
to port aransas.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.700
I'm not sure I...
oh, honey

01:35.767 --> 01:37.933
we stopped at
the pancake house

01:38.067 --> 01:39.933
and one thing
just led to another.

01:40.067 --> 01:43.933
Blueberry pancakes mean
blueberries in the pancakes

01:44.067 --> 01:46.933
not buttermilk grill cakes
with blue sauce on top.

01:47.067 --> 01:48.600
They brought
you new ones.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.267
That's not the point.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.967
It was horrible.

01:52.067 --> 01:52.967
This is lillian.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.067
She's delicate.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.600
Pleased to meet you,
lillian.

01:55.667 --> 01:56.600
oh!

01:56.667 --> 01:58.433
That was much
too sudden.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.667
You know, mom,
that van of yours

02:00.733 --> 02:02.300
is a lot to handle.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.300
In many ways, it's
more of a light truck.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.300
Maybe this trip
is just too much
for you to take on.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.633
Yep. I think it is.

02:09.699 --> 02:10.967
Well, I have to drive.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.100
I'm the youngest.

02:12.167 --> 02:14.300
Maureen's only
ten years older

02:14.367 --> 02:15.967
but she lost
her license.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.867
It was took last march.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.167
Delia gets angry.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.967
The doctor
calls it "road rage."

02:21.067 --> 02:22.300
Oh, I'll drive.

02:22.367 --> 02:23.967
It's only been
40 years.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.967
We are talking
about a bicycle?

02:26.067 --> 02:27.867
I don't have
a choice, peggy.

02:27.933 --> 02:30.067
I've got to drive them
the rest of the way.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.633
Hank, if you want to go visit
a miniature museum

02:32.700 --> 02:34.200
then just come
out and say so.

02:34.267 --> 02:35.533
I won't tell anyone.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.967
I hate miniatures.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.967
I've hated them
since I was a kid.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.633
Mom only took
them out when

02:40.700 --> 02:42.300
she was heading
into a funk--

02:42.367 --> 02:46.067
Like, between the time
I was ten and 14.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.067
( dale snickering )

02:48.067 --> 02:51.167
enjoy your trip
to the miniature museum, hank.

02:51.233 --> 02:52.633
Hope you can fit inside.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.633
( laughing )

02:54.700 --> 02:55.967
( choking )

02:56.067 --> 02:57.967
( chuckling ):
yeah, man, you know

02:58.067 --> 02:59.633
talkin' 'bout
ol' party van

02:59.700 --> 03:01.800
man, hank gets out...
little ol' lady.

03:01.867 --> 03:04.100
( speaking gibberish ):
have good time...

03:04.167 --> 03:05.600
With them lil' ol' ladies.

03:05.667 --> 03:06.833
Very funny, guys.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.767
I can't think
of anything funnier

03:08.833 --> 03:11.300
than a man having to take care
of his mother.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.767
Ho! That's
just hilarious.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.600
You think your
mother would find
that funny, dale?

03:16.667 --> 03:18.900
Not the way you tell it.

03:30.367 --> 03:33.600
Yep, the wildflowers
sure are lovely this spring.

03:33.667 --> 03:34.933
I always say

03:35.067 --> 03:37.400
there's nothing like
texas wildflowers.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.933
You think we arizonans
don't have flowers?

03:40.067 --> 03:41.367
I never said that.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.733
Tilly, that boy of yours
just called me a liar.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
I did not!

03:44.867 --> 03:46.900
Hank, just apologize
to delia.

03:46.967 --> 03:48.400
But I never said...

03:48.467 --> 03:50.167
Delia gets a little
out of sorts

03:50.233 --> 03:51.933
when her blood sugar
falls low.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.567
Otherwise, she's lovely.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.600
Here's a piece
of hard candy, dear.

03:55.667 --> 03:56.933
mmm.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.800
( sucking noises )

03:58.867 --> 04:00.833
♪ uptown girl ♪

04:00.900 --> 04:04.300
♪ you know she's living
in her uptown world... ♪

04:04.367 --> 04:06.667
bill:
* and when she's walking *

04:06.733 --> 04:09.533
♪ she's looking so fi-i-ine... ♪

04:09.600 --> 04:10.333
bill?

04:10.400 --> 04:11.333
Yeah.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.667
You shouldn't have to be

04:12.733 --> 04:14.500
working with your hands, peggy.

04:14.567 --> 04:15.767
You're a lady.

04:15.833 --> 04:16.966
( chuckling ):
oh...

04:17.067 --> 04:18.200
Oh, bill.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.300
Here, let me help.

04:20.367 --> 04:21.800
It must be nice
having a man

04:21.867 --> 04:23.800
around the house
again, huh, peggy?

04:23.867 --> 04:25.633
Actually, hank has
only been gone

04:25.700 --> 04:26.967
an hour and a half.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.533
I'll tell
you, peggy

04:28.600 --> 04:30.533
i'd never leave you
for an hour and half.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.367
Your shirt is... Very dirty.

04:33.433 --> 04:35.967
( chuckles ):
oh, that's not dirt.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.800
That's, that's chili sauce

04:37.867 --> 04:40.067
and such.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.467
( turns radio on )

04:47.533 --> 04:48.967
what's that boy doing?

04:49.067 --> 04:50.967
I'm just getting
a traffic report.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.900
Radio makes lillian
carsick.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.067
You can't get carsick
from a radio.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.967
Carsick's an
inner-ear thing.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.200
Turn on the radio.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.933
I'd prefer not to risk it.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.067
I was a nurse
for 40 years.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.067
I know
all about carsick.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.067
I've never been
carsick in my life.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.100
What should I do?

05:10.167 --> 05:11.233
The problem with you

05:11.300 --> 05:12.867
is you never know
what to do.

05:12.933 --> 05:13.900
You just met me.

05:13.967 --> 05:15.500
I know your kind.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.900
Would you please
turn on the radio?

05:17.967 --> 05:20.533
( static )
( gagging )

05:20.600 --> 05:22.700
all right, ladies.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.433
You can get back in.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.633
Careful, bobby.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.233
You know how your mother and I
worry about you.

05:31.300 --> 05:36.733
Uh, you know, she worries
about you, too, Mr. Dauterive.

05:36.800 --> 05:37.900
She does?

05:37.967 --> 05:39.533
I guess.
I don't know.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.200
( excited giggling )

05:41.267 --> 05:42.700
lillian:
look, everyone.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.200
Port aransas.

05:44.267 --> 05:47.300
Tilly:
it looks like
a miniature island.

05:47.367 --> 05:49.600
Oh, it's a shame
it has to get bigger.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.433
I want to remember it
like this.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.500
So I guess all of you
are as crazy for miniatures

05:55.567 --> 05:56.867
as my mom, huh?

05:56.933 --> 05:59.267
I wouldn't use the word "crazy."

05:59.333 --> 06:00.433
To the miniatures.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.833
All:
To the miniatures.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.767
( knocking on door )

06:19.833 --> 06:21.533
huh, what?

06:24.067 --> 06:25.267
Oh, hurry.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.767
We're going to be
late for the museum.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.633
It's not even 5:00 a.m.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.967
That kind of attitude

06:30.067 --> 06:31.967
is not going to get you
ready any faster.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.100
Okay, okay.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.467
Will you ladies
just give me

06:35.533 --> 06:36.767
a few minutes
to shave?

06:36.833 --> 06:37.967
no.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.767
Hank ( chuckling ):
well, looks like

06:41.833 --> 06:43.600
we might have gotten here
a little early.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.267
What's the big joke?

06:45.333 --> 06:46.767
It's not a joke.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.433
Then it's us,
isn't it?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.267
Apparently,
we amuse you
in some way.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.067
( under breath ):
I wish.

06:54.067 --> 06:56.767
Well, that
was interesting.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.267
Stay. Watch.

06:58.333 --> 07:01.067
Lyle neff is one
of the world's

07:01.067 --> 07:03.067
most renowned
micropointilists.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.367
Lyle neff?

07:04.433 --> 07:05.533
Oh, god

07:05.600 --> 07:08.633
I haven't heard that name
since I was 13.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.833
You know, I'd always pictured
him with a scrawnier mustache.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.067
They say the sprites
talk through his hands.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.767
That's a nice-looking...

07:16.833 --> 07:18.333
Ah... Seal.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.733
It is an otter.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.633
Lyle neff would never
waste his time on seals.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.167
Seals are
trash mammals.

07:24.233 --> 07:25.633
Everybody knows that.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.333
( sighing )

07:27.400 --> 07:29.833
tilly:
six cucumber sandwiches,
please.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.300
Uh, I'll have
the hamburger
sandwich instead.

07:33.367 --> 07:36.333
The cucumber sandwiches
are delicious here.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.967
I don't like
cucumber.

07:38.067 --> 07:38.900
( all gasp )

07:38.967 --> 07:41.633
I apologize
for my son.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.867
Come on, mom.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.967
You don't have
to apologize for me.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.733
Apparently, I do.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.167
Mom? It's me, hank.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.367
Just came to say
good night.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.633
Shouldn't you be in bed?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.867
It's almost 7:30.

07:56.933 --> 07:58.167
Look at this.

07:58.233 --> 08:00.167
Don't they look happy?

08:00.233 --> 08:01.567
They like it here.

08:01.633 --> 08:04.900
Uh, mom, those
are just glass.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.600
I know that, hank.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.933
My point is
they're from the island

08:09.067 --> 08:11.133
and they like being home.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.067
You're not falling into
one of those funks

08:13.133 --> 08:14.233
are you, mom?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.267
I haven't seen you, uh...

08:16.333 --> 08:18.933
Socialize
with your miniatures since...

08:19.067 --> 08:21.433
Gosh, since you were married
to dad.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.567
I'll helps you with your dishes.

08:24.633 --> 08:26.567
mom?

08:26.633 --> 08:28.900
Mom, what should I do?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.467
mom?

08:30.533 --> 08:33.133
( sighing )

08:33.200 --> 08:34.299
quiet, you!

08:39.067 --> 08:40.732
Bill:
cleaning?

08:40.799 --> 08:41.933
How did you
get in, bill?

08:42.067 --> 08:43.600
You gave me a key,
remember--

08:43.667 --> 08:45.167
When you went
on vacation

08:45.233 --> 08:46.767
so I could feed
ladybird.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.700
That was six years ago.

08:48.767 --> 08:51.367
Uh-huh. It's probably a good
thing I held on to it, too.

08:51.433 --> 08:52.767
After all,
you never know when...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.167
Peggy:
I want it back.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.833
now!

08:55.900 --> 08:57.367
All right. Let me help you

08:57.433 --> 08:59.433
with that trash.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
Why is he
hugging our trash?

09:01.567 --> 09:03.667
As long as he
does not take it

09:03.733 --> 09:05.233
into his house

09:05.300 --> 09:07.100
we're okay.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.800
( door closing )

09:08.867 --> 09:10.067
oh, no.

09:12.433 --> 09:18.467
Hank:
i'll have a dune-burggy,
medium rare, and a beer.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.067
At last, a few signs
of civilization.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.333
Hey, guys.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.967
How those longhorns
looking for next year?

09:25.067 --> 09:26.700
Totally awesome,
dude.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.800
"awesome."

09:27.867 --> 09:28.833
( chuckling )

09:28.900 --> 09:30.367
that's what I like to hear.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.533
Let me buy you a beer
and we can talk some football.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.967
Don't mind if we do.

09:34.900 --> 09:38.567
( both screaming )

09:39.967 --> 09:41.500
hey, fellas, slow down.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.567
We've got the whole bench
to go over.

09:43.633 --> 09:45.567
( chuckling )

09:45.633 --> 09:48.300
I tell you, this is just
what I needed.

09:48.367 --> 09:49.533
I spent the day

09:49.600 --> 09:53.333
with about 500 years
of old lady.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.300
Oh, if they could see me now
having a beer and a hamburger

09:57.367 --> 09:59.767
that would push them
right over the edge

09:59.833 --> 10:00.833
I tell you what.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.867
( knocking )

10:07.933 --> 10:10.000
hold onto your hats, ladies.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.833
The museum'll still be there
at dawn.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.833
( loud music and chatter )

10:15.900 --> 10:17.867
no. What...?

10:17.933 --> 10:20.833
Hey, you kids
knock it off!

10:20.900 --> 10:23.967
Come on!
some of us are trying to sleep!

10:24.033 --> 10:25.500
Okay, you asked for it.

10:25.567 --> 10:26.700
you.

10:26.767 --> 10:29.000
What room are
your parents in?

10:29.067 --> 10:31.000
( gagging )

10:31.067 --> 10:34.033
oh, for goodness sake!

10:35.567 --> 10:38.200
And none of you heard
any of that last night?

10:38.267 --> 10:39.733
no.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.867
( high-pitched whine )

10:40.933 --> 10:44.567
i-I smell something unpleasant
in this hallway.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.700
It's making me rather...

10:46.767 --> 10:48.500
( retching )

10:48.567 --> 10:51.067
hank:
son, your blinker's on.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.833
Merge. Merge, already.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.500
( groaning )

10:54.567 --> 10:56.033
oh, look at this crowd.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.700
That museum
is going to be a madhouse.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.567
I think it would be safest

11:02.633 --> 11:05.133
if we used a buddy system
to get around.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.233
Hank, you're making
too much out of this.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.633
Mom, that fella asked you
to show him your high beams.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.933
Now, do you even know
what he meant?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.167
Of course I do.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.800
I've been driving
longer than you.

11:16.867 --> 11:19.067
No. Mom, what
he meant was...

11:19.133 --> 11:21.167
Oh, hank, look--
a unicorn.

11:21.233 --> 11:24.100
I have
just the little nook for you

11:24.167 --> 11:26.300
oh, yes, I do.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.733
Peggy! Isn't it funny

11:31.800 --> 11:34.633
we ran into
each other here
just by chance?

11:34.700 --> 11:37.833
I didn't even
know you shopped
at this market.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.567
It's the one
closest to the house, bill.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.733
I think so, too.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.067
You know what I'm shopping for?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.133
Food.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.800
I didn't ask you, all right?

11:45.867 --> 11:48.067
I'm having a barbecue
this afternoon.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.567
See you there.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.267
No, you will not.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.367
Okay, then. 4:00.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.867
( loud music and chatter )

11:59.533 --> 12:01.600
( groans )

12:10.533 --> 12:11.567
( gasps )

12:11.633 --> 12:15.367
( whooping )

12:15.433 --> 12:16.633
oh, god.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.800
All right, gentlemen and ladies,
let's take a vote.

12:20.867 --> 12:22.133
Warm water...

12:22.200 --> 12:23.300
( cheering )

12:25.333 --> 12:27.133
♪ give it to me, baby... ♪

12:27.200 --> 12:30.333
or... Cold water?

12:30.400 --> 12:33.067
( cheering )

12:34.200 --> 12:35.667
cold water it is!

12:35.733 --> 12:37.867
( animal-like grunting )

12:37.933 --> 12:38.967
rockadillo...

12:39.067 --> 12:40.633
Do your stuff!

12:40.700 --> 12:42.567
( deejay laughing )

12:42.633 --> 12:45.100
but-but cold water's going
to make their...

12:45.167 --> 12:46.300
( shuddering groan )

12:46.367 --> 12:48.467
okay, let's go,
buddy up.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.133
Delia, you hold
maureen's hand.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.133
no.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.133
We're fighting.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.533
She ate
the last scone.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.233
And it was delicious.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.900
( groaning sigh )

12:56.967 --> 12:57.900
r-randy!

12:57.967 --> 12:58.967
Randy, chad

12:59.067 --> 13:00.300
it's me, hank!

13:00.367 --> 13:02.933
Hey, it's that dude
from last night.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.367
( grunting )

13:05.433 --> 13:06.367
( sighs )

13:06.433 --> 13:07.600
i'm sorry.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.200
I didn't mean
to let that happen.

13:09.267 --> 13:10.567
The problem
with you is

13:10.633 --> 13:12.700
you never mean to
let anything happen.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.900
It's a horrible,
empty way to live.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.967
Barbecuing?

13:19.067 --> 13:19.967
no!

13:20.067 --> 13:20.967
Go away!

13:21.067 --> 13:22.267
This is peggy's.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.067
She's got no one
to do her barbecuing

13:24.100 --> 13:25.367
now that hank's left her.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.767
"left her"?

13:26.833 --> 13:28.567
He's only on a two-day trip
with his mom.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.133
And four other
single women.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.300
( horns honking )

13:35.367 --> 13:37.233
"how's my driving?"

13:37.300 --> 13:38.400
i'll tell you.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.300
Mom, right this
number down--

13:40.367 --> 13:43.167
"1-800...

13:43.233 --> 13:47.500
E-a-t-s-h..."

13:47.567 --> 13:48.500
Uh...

13:48.567 --> 13:49.833
Never mind.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.833
Deejay:
spring break '99 continues

13:51.900 --> 13:54.500
with some of the hottest bands,
bods and buns

13:54.567 --> 13:56.167
on the port I call aransas!

13:56.233 --> 13:58.500
Am I right, rockadillo?!

13:58.567 --> 14:00.900
( animal-like grunting )

14:00.967 --> 14:03.367
and party '99 is
only getting better

14:03.433 --> 14:06.800
'cause adam sandler's going
to be performing live!

14:06.867 --> 14:08.133
( howls )

14:08.200 --> 14:11.267
( cheering )

14:20.400 --> 14:21.767
there, you're packed.

14:21.833 --> 14:24.333
But we haven't seen
the glade of elsinore

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
at the museum.

14:25.567 --> 14:26.767
Forget about the museum.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.500
We've got to get off this island

14:28.567 --> 14:30.933
before they run out of beer
and start rioting.

14:31.067 --> 14:34.167
The glade of elsinore is crafted
from real flowers.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.500
That means the pigments
fade, stupid.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.267
I don't care.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.367
We're leaving.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.233
Oh, you're impossible.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.700
( hip-hop music playing )

14:49.767 --> 14:51.500
I tell you what--
it'll be great

14:51.567 --> 14:53.767
when all these kids
look like miniatures

14:53.833 --> 14:55.433
in our rear-view
mirror, huh?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.467
( hank chuckling )

14:57.533 --> 14:58.467
( sighs )

14:58.533 --> 14:59.833
when you're all back safe

14:59.900 --> 15:01.967
in your homes
and planned communities

15:02.067 --> 15:03.167
you'll thank me.

15:03.233 --> 15:04.833
My god, hank, stop!

15:04.900 --> 15:07.067
Mom, I told
you, I will...

15:07.100 --> 15:08.300
Hank, stop this van.

15:08.367 --> 15:09.067
Hank:
what is it?

15:09.067 --> 15:10.367
Are you okay?

15:10.433 --> 15:11.533
No, I'm not.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.500
I'm not okay at all.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.633
I've left my unicorn.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.300
( horrified gasping )

15:17.367 --> 15:18.833
we have to go back
for it.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.433
We'll Miss the
ferry. I can't.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.333
Hank, tiny glass unicorns
are as hard to find

15:23.400 --> 15:24.667
as a real unicorn.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.400
I can't leave without mine.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.067
Now I've had
enough, mom.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.367
Forget the damn unicorn

15:29.433 --> 15:31.333
and all these
stupid little dolls

15:31.400 --> 15:32.833
from when you
went weird.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.067
Oh, delia was right.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.533
Hank, you are impossible.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.067
Which one of you is delia?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.067
She is.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.733
I could commit you like that.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.633
Oh, no.

15:42.700 --> 15:43.800
Stay put.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.267
mom!

15:59.700 --> 16:00.700
( sighs )

16:00.767 --> 16:02.133
now, these should
hold you

16:02.200 --> 16:03.700
till I get back.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.733
I wanted milk,
not cream.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.467
Cream makes me logy.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.600
Live with it.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.700
Excuse me.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.467
Have you seen a
nice-looking older lady--

16:17.533 --> 16:19.533
Gray hair, yellow
golf sweater?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.733
Mmm, stand right there

16:21.800 --> 16:23.067
while I think
about it.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.200
What?

16:24.267 --> 16:26.267
I don't see why I need to...

16:26.333 --> 16:27.967
Yo, gotcha!

16:28.067 --> 16:30.700
Hey, can't you see I'm looking
for a lady?

16:30.767 --> 16:32.467
We're all looking
for ladies, dude.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.367
That's what spring break
is all about.

16:34.433 --> 16:35.867
Yeah!
yeah!

16:38.200 --> 16:39.467
Bill?

16:39.533 --> 16:41.467
Why isn't
bobby playing?

16:41.533 --> 16:44.633
You don't look good,
mr. Dauterive.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.800
Have you been
in a fire?

16:46.867 --> 16:47.933
( whimpering )

16:48.067 --> 16:48.967
( sobbing )

16:49.067 --> 16:50.133
bill, are you okay?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.533
No, I am not okay.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.700
I am... I'm not
okay at all.

16:53.767 --> 16:57.400
I didn't make you a barbecue
just so you wouldn't show up

16:57.467 --> 17:00.867
and I didn't come here to
not watch bobby play ball!

17:00.933 --> 17:01.867
Bill, please!

17:01.933 --> 17:03.200
People can hear you!

17:03.267 --> 17:04.367
I don't care!

17:04.433 --> 17:06.067
Maybe it's
time they did!

17:06.067 --> 17:07.067
Hey, coach!

17:07.067 --> 17:08.267
You, coach!

17:08.333 --> 17:09.800
Why aren't you
playing bobby hill?

17:09.867 --> 17:11.666
I am responsible
for that boy!

17:11.733 --> 17:12.800
You play him now!

17:12.867 --> 17:14.099
You hear me?!
you!

17:14.166 --> 17:15.433
( groans )

17:15.500 --> 17:19.099
oh, peggy... I'm
not angry at you.

17:19.166 --> 17:22.067
Bill, you get
your arm off me!

17:22.099 --> 17:25.067
( bill groaning )

17:25.067 --> 17:26.067
oh, yeah!

17:26.067 --> 17:27.233
Come on, cougars!

17:27.300 --> 17:28.233
Come on!

17:28.300 --> 17:29.433
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

17:31.433 --> 17:33.467
mom.

17:33.533 --> 17:34.867
mom?

17:34.933 --> 17:36.400
mom?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.367
( sighs )

17:39.433 --> 17:41.067
excuse me.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.667
I'm looking for a
nice-looking older
lady... Sweater.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.367
Uh, she-she
needed a unicorn.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.700
Don't they all?

17:46.767 --> 17:48.433
Was she here?

17:48.500 --> 17:51.400
She left a few minutes
ago, one unicorn richer.

17:51.467 --> 17:52.933
Damn those stupid
miniatures!

17:53.067 --> 17:54.667
They're going to
get her killed.

17:54.733 --> 17:55.933
You don't
know anything.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.533
What?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.767
Miniatures probably saved
your mother's life.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.433
What's that supposed to mean?

18:01.500 --> 18:03.833
Do you know how hard it is
to be a woman in this world?

18:03.900 --> 18:05.300
I do.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.267
Women come in here all the time
and they are sad

18:07.333 --> 18:08.967
and they are lonely
and they are frumpy

18:09.067 --> 18:10.467
and they tell me
how my tiny

18:10.533 --> 18:12.500
individually hand-crafted,
investment-grade art is

18:12.567 --> 18:14.633
the only thing
keeping them sane.

18:14.700 --> 18:15.833
Do you understand?

18:15.900 --> 18:17.767
Does that sound like
your mother?

18:17.833 --> 18:19.100
no.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.633
Well... Maybe

18:20.700 --> 18:24.167
when her marriage to my
dad was breaking up, but...

18:24.233 --> 18:25.767
So, uh...

18:25.833 --> 18:29.867
So, this little glass crap
really helped her out, huh?

18:29.933 --> 18:31.200
huh.

18:31.267 --> 18:34.067
I guess I owe someone
an apology.

18:34.067 --> 18:36.067
Accepted.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.067
Uh...

18:38.133 --> 18:39.067
Mom...

18:39.133 --> 18:40.400
About back in the car...

18:40.467 --> 18:41.400
Well, uh...

18:41.467 --> 18:42.400
Well, here.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.933
What is it?

18:44.067 --> 18:47.300
Uh, it's the los angeles
international airport

18:47.367 --> 18:49.267
carved in a walnut shell.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.600
Oh, look at the detail.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.433
Don't worry,
little puppy.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.633
Someone's coming
to claim you.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.967
It's wonderful.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.133
Yeah, it's a...
it's a neff.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.300
( younger crowd cheering )

19:05.100 --> 19:06.933
we got to go, mom, now.

19:07.067 --> 19:09.333
The last ferry
leaves in 15 minutes

19:09.400 --> 19:12.167
and the brochure
recommends getting there

19:12.233 --> 19:13.767
ten minutes
in advance.

19:25.733 --> 19:27.333
( sighs )

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
maureen! Maureen!

19:44.400 --> 19:45.833
( startled yell )

19:45.900 --> 19:48.267
takes two minutes
to develop.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.533
Hank...

19:52.600 --> 19:55.333
They passed her over the crowd
like a beach ball.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.433
Ah, hell.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.733
Invasion!

20:07.567 --> 20:09.233
Hey now, you...

20:09.300 --> 20:10.767
( animal-like grunting )

20:12.900 --> 20:14.733
hey!

20:16.400 --> 20:17.467
hey!

20:17.533 --> 20:19.033
those are prescription,
dang it!

20:19.100 --> 20:20.500
Give me that!

20:20.567 --> 20:21.500
You damn...

20:21.567 --> 20:22.500
( grunts )

20:22.567 --> 20:23.867
get your...

20:23.933 --> 20:26.433
No, help, man!
get off the...

20:36.233 --> 20:40.067
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

20:43.300 --> 20:44.767
( gasps )

20:55.267 --> 20:56.200
oh, no.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.900
Don't worry.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.400
We're going
to make it.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.067
( gasping and shrieking )

21:02.533 --> 21:05.233
hank:
oh, god, no!

21:05.300 --> 21:07.067
Everybody stay calm.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.900
We just experienced
severe tire damage.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.400
You said you'd get us
out of here.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.567
Tilly, your boy is
all talk.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.900
I hate you.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.567
Hank, get us
out of here.

21:17.633 --> 21:19.067
We're down to the rims.

21:19.133 --> 21:22.233
If we drive on them, they
may never be true again.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.067
( helicopter rotors
whirring )

21:25.467 --> 21:26.900
hank:
oh, no.

21:26.967 --> 21:29.967
Hold onto your hats, ladies.

21:43.933 --> 21:45.733
Oh, look,
everyone...

21:45.800 --> 21:47.100
Port aransas.

21:47.167 --> 21:50.300
Oh, I can't wait
to get there.

22:02.467 --> 22:03.400
Who's ready?

22:03.467 --> 22:04.567
Lay it on me.

22:04.633 --> 22:06.567
Well, I probably
could use a beer.

22:06.633 --> 22:07.567
Dale.

22:07.633 --> 22:08.733
Thank you.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.900
Boomhauer.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.900
Dang ol' thanks, man.

22:11.967 --> 22:13.133
Bill.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.300
( grunts )

22:15.367 --> 22:16.500
( groans )

22:16.567 --> 22:18.333
oh, sorry about that...

22:18.400 --> 22:22.400
And, uh, thanks for looking
after peggy for me, bill.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.533
ow!

22:23.600 --> 22:25.900
It won't happen
again, hank.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.400
yep.

22:27.467 --> 22:30.100
I know your kind.
