I'd like to get a list
of those students.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.280
You know, I'm having a hard time believing
any of our students would be involved

26:37.304 --> 26:39.386
in something like this.

26:39.723 --> 26:44.057
I feel like they'd be more inclined to
go after a teacher or a fellow student.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.309
Me.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.970
But not the mayor.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.223
[phone vibrating]
I'm sorry.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.818
Oh... It's the superintendent.
Hold on.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.738
- Hi, Lisa.
- [over phone] Calvin, are you by your computer?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.570
No, not at the moment. Why?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.241
[Lisa continues indistinctly]

27:08.460 --> 27:09.666
What do you mean "everything"?

27:09.711 --> 27:11.417
[school bell ringing]

27:17.219 --> 27:18.425
[indistinct chatter]

27:25.561 --> 27:29.804
[girl] Okay, anyone can read anything
we've sent to each other, since...?

27:30.107 --> 27:31.187
Since I got a phone.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.641
Since you got a phone,
or this phone?

27:34.695 --> 27:39.029
Well, the SIM card. I mean, I haven't
deleted anything in, like, what?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.610
So, what, five years?

27:41.451 --> 27:42.657
[sharp exhale]

27:43.453 --> 27:45.614
What have we talked about?

27:46.707 --> 27:49.494
Jesus... what have we said?

27:51.044 --> 27:53.285
[whooping alarm]

27:53.338 --> 27:55.704
Baby, what did the doctor say?

27:56.758 --> 28:00.125
He said a lot of women
over the age of 40 miscarry.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.512
Let me just read a few of the Pornhub
videos our principal has viewed

28:03.557 --> 28:05.138
over the last couple months.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.345
"Cute teen makes her pussy pulse
with orgasm."

28:08.645 --> 28:12.308
Principal Turrell couldn't even make
amends with his father before he died.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.564
Like, that's really cold.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.895
Like his wife was begging him to

28:15.944 --> 28:17.547
and he couldn't put aside
his own bullshit.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.482
It's like you have no emotion.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.987
Just saying.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.399
But the main thing we need
to talk about

28:23.452 --> 28:25.555
are the eight nude photos of his
daughter in his iPhoto library.

28:25.579 --> 28:26.944
Have you seen the pictures?

28:26.997 --> 28:29.613
They're from three
and a half years ago,

28:29.666 --> 28:32.312
which would have made Allison Turrell
only six and a half when they were taken.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.827
She's in the bath,
and you can see everything.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.122
- Disgusting! Oh, my God!
- [wild laughter]

28:38.175 --> 28:40.175
[female student] Let me ask you,
Principal Turrell,

28:40.219 --> 28:42.961
did your 6-year-old daughter
consent to those?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.008
[vibrating text alert]

28:46.058 --> 28:48.411
[man] Well, I got the email about the
school board meeting tomorrow night?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.622
- [vibrating text alert]
- Gonna vote on whether to fire the principal.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.979
[woman] There was always something about
him that just didn't sit right with me.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.309
- [man] Hmm.
- [phone vibrates]

28:55.359 --> 28:56.565
You and a lot of people.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.562
[sent text tone]

28:58.987 --> 29:02.650
[woman] I mean, I just find
the whole thing very disturbing.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.279
Disturbing?

29:06.328 --> 29:08.819
There are boundaries, Lily,
between a father and a daughter.

29:09.289 --> 29:12.372
You may not believe that, but there are.
Absolutely.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.750
I was never comfortable seeing
you naked after you were two.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.336
Why?

29:19.424 --> 29:20.424
You're my daughter.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.249
Not a good enough reason.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.543
But that's exactly what I mean.
I'm your daughter.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.836
Why would you be weirded out?

29:26.807 --> 29:28.547
Lily, that's enough.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.554
All I'm trying to say...

29:32.229 --> 29:35.392
is that nudity isn't
inherently sexual.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.807
And it's the same thing
with these photos.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.397
They're not sexual. It's you guys
that are making them sexual.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.188
Okay, just because a young girl is
naked, doesn't mean it's sexual

29:44.241 --> 29:45.321
or creepy or pervy.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.323
And it doesn't make him
a child molester.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.576
Lily, give me a break.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.363
Mom, there's a naked photo of me on
the mantelpiece at two years old.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.657
Do you think
that is child pornography?

29:54.710 --> 29:58.453
Lily, I am not going to sit here and
listen to you defend a child molester.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.858
[Lily] But that's my point,
he's not a child molester. [scoffs]

30:00.882 --> 30:03.794
He is a victim in this.
Just like his daughter.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.172
Lily, you like to debate.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.007
And I respect that.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.701
You want to play devil's advocate.
You're smart.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.558
You don't know the first thing
about this world, sweetheart.

30:12.602 --> 30:17.392
And you call us prudes, old-fashioned,
but I'm gonna tell you something.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.397
I've been
on this earth 45 years,

30:19.443 --> 30:20.808
and if there's one thing I know,

30:20.861 --> 30:23.022
men will be men,
girls will be girls,

30:23.071 --> 30:26.234
and until you can protect yourself,
I'm going to do that for you.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.523
[stabs at plate, exhales]

30:29.077 --> 30:30.077
[Lily] Wow.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.043
[door slams]

30:39.629 --> 30:43.121
You guys ever see that video of
the family on safari in Africa?

30:43.175 --> 30:45.917
And they get mauled
by like seven tigers?

30:47.095 --> 30:48.095
No, Donny.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.014
I missed it.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.726
It's pretty cool.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.900
[soft electronic music playing]

31:18.710 --> 31:19.790
[sent text tone]

31:20.712 --> 31:21.712
[dog barking in distance]

31:23.048 --> 31:24.048
[sent text tone]

31:25.717 --> 31:28.049
[keyboard clacking]

31:28.929 --> 31:30.044
[received text tone]

31:33.683 --> 31:34.683
[sent text tone]

31:49.282 --> 31:51.819
[keyboard clacking]

31:58.291 --> 31:59.781
[message received tone]

32:29.448 --> 32:30.563
[message received tone]

32:55.390 --> 32:56.721
Hey, Principal Turrell.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.906
[Sarah] What do you have
to hide anyway though?

33:07.235 --> 33:08.771
Excuse me?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.310
Have you seen her...?

33:10.363 --> 33:14.231
I mean, like a million nudes,
super gross porn history,

33:14.284 --> 33:16.320
super pervy texts,

33:16.369 --> 33:20.203
and, like, life-altering shit-talk
about almost everyone at this school.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.248
And my family.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.374
[Em] Fair enough.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.498
[Bex] Me too.
[Sarah] Me three.

33:24.544 --> 33:27.160
My iPhoto looks like
a fucking snuff film.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.920
[all laugh]

33:28.965 --> 33:31.206
- [Lily] I love you.
- Hopefully nudes...

33:31.259 --> 33:32.294
[sarcastic laughter]

33:32.344 --> 33:33.629
[girl 2] What are you doing?

33:33.678 --> 33:35.134
[Bex] Looking at Turrell's hack.

33:35.639 --> 33:39.006
[Lily] One hundred and forty-two
thousand downloads, that's like...

33:39.476 --> 33:41.182
three times the size of Salem.

33:41.228 --> 33:44.516
[scoffs] I'm sorry, but I just
don't have, like, any sympathy

33:44.856 --> 33:46.642
for people
that get their shit hacked.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.274
[Lily] For real?

33:49.611 --> 33:51.547
Yeah, I mean, there's two types of
people in this world, you know?

33:51.571 --> 33:55.029
Like, the people that have come to
terms with privacy is just dead.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.844
And, like, you know,
then there's the old people

33:56.868 --> 33:58.188
that are still trying
to fight it.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.995
I guess. [girl 2] I mean,
the Internet is amazing.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.953
Like, this guy in Minnesota,
he's like 42, whatever.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.665
But basically he subscribed
to my Amazon wish list

34:09.714 --> 34:12.706
and now legit he just buys
me shit all the time.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.248
Why?

34:14.302 --> 34:16.072
I don't know. I guess he just
really likes my lnsta, you know?

34:16.096 --> 34:19.213
Like, he likes that I'm real
and, like, I'm cool,

34:19.266 --> 34:21.202
- and, you know, I'm a free soul.
- [girls stifling laughter]

34:21.226 --> 34:24.138
It's really sad, because
basically 90 percent of people

34:24.187 --> 34:28.396
are just so sad and lonely and
have such an unfulfilling life.

34:29.150 --> 34:33.188
If I'm, like, inspiring people,
you know, and my life is so cool

34:33.237 --> 34:35.695
and, like, people connect
with me on such a level,

34:35.739 --> 34:38.947
then, like, basically my job
for the day is done.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.431
[Bex, stifling laughter] But what's that got
to do with people's shit getting hacked?

34:42.455 --> 34:43.911
- [phone vibrates]
- Oh, hold on.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.493
I gotta get this. Hi, baby!

34:48.085 --> 34:49.085
[Em] Bye, baby!

34:49.129 --> 34:51.120
[Sarah] Um... Okay...

34:52.090 --> 34:53.090
Come here.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.255
Yeah, come here.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.297
I love a little
Princess Leia hair.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.637
[whispered] Carrie, if you're
listening, we miss you.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.397
[administrator] The thing to do is to
go out there and speak from the heart.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.318
Tell the board and the parents what
being principal has meant to you

35:15.363 --> 35:16.978
for the last nine years.

35:17.032 --> 35:20.195
Tell them you understand
their concerns.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.155
And resign with grace.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.168
Mark.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.674
Mark?

35:37.260 --> 35:38.420
Hello?

35:40.347 --> 35:41.757
Dude, what are you doing?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.384
- Agh!
- [Lily screams]

35:44.434 --> 35:46.245
- [Lily] What the fuck!
- Oh, yeah, got you now, bitch!

35:46.269 --> 35:47.509
- [Lily] Help me!
- Got you now!

35:47.604 --> 35:49.811
- [wild laughter]
- [Lily gasps]

35:49.856 --> 35:52.689
Oh, my God! You piece of shit.
You should have seen your fucking face.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.349
You piece of shit.
It was a fucking joke.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.984
Goddammit.
Oh, my God. Priceless.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.736
Hey, come here. Come here.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.735
You should have seen
your stupid face.

36:06.873 --> 36:07.873
Whatever.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.330
What are you doing tonight?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.743
Em and Sarah might be having
some people over.

36:13.797 --> 36:16.834
Oh, yeah? That's what I heard.
Hmm. Look at you.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.625
Yeah, am I invited?
Hmm...

36:21.262 --> 36:22.593
Guess I can ask.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.429
See you there.
[laughs]

36:26.101 --> 36:27.466
[tense music playing]

36:42.659 --> 36:44.570
[hostile clamoring]

36:47.080 --> 36:48.490
[clamor continues]

36:57.924 --> 36:59.960
I know I've met
a lot of you before.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.459
But in light
of the circumstances...

37:02.512 --> 37:04.127
[woman 3] Please, let him speak.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.556
Thank you.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.014
I'd like to just
introduce myself to you.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.013
And tell you
why I became a teacher.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.769
- [man 1] Because you're a pedophile!
- [crowd] Yeah!

37:14.649 --> 37:16.480
I grew up not far from here.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.523
In a neighborhood that didn't afford
the same opportunities as Salem.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.528
The schools were underfunded,

37:22.574 --> 37:25.862
the teachers, by and large,
didn't care as much, and...

37:26.244 --> 37:30.283
Up until I was a sophomore in high school,
I never even dreamed of going to college.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.698
I was shy and,
to a certain extent, lost.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.540
[man 2] We don't need your fucking
life story, just fucking resign!

37:38.965 --> 37:41.297
[yelling, boos]

37:41.342 --> 37:45.176
[man 2] We fucking trusted you,
and you betrayed that trust.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.158
- [man 1] We saw the pictures!
- [man 2] We gonna stand here

37:47.182 --> 37:49.201
- and listen to this man?
- I will not walk away from these students.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.681
I will not resign!

37:50.727 --> 37:51.807
[man 2] What the fuck?

37:53.354 --> 37:54.434
This piece of shit!

37:54.481 --> 37:55.750
- [Turrell] Just listen...
- [spits]

37:55.774 --> 37:58.231
I will leave it to you,
my community.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.983
My community of peers,
I leave it in your hands.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.023
[man 2] Lock him up!

38:03.072 --> 38:04.800
- [crowd takes up chant]
- [crowd] Lock him up!

38:04.824 --> 38:08.533
No matter how salacious
the details are,

38:08.912 --> 38:14.953
I invite you to look at the
context of who I am as a person.

38:15.502 --> 38:19.836
- Lock him up! Lock him up!
- I am not the monster that you think I am!

38:20.256 --> 38:22.087
[man 2] Lock him up!

38:22.133 --> 38:25.591
[crowd continues chanting]
Lock him up! Lock him up!

38:31.100 --> 38:33.807
- [glass shatters]
- [Allison screams] Mom!

38:33.853 --> 38:35.809
[vandal]
Kid molester motherfucker!

38:37.440 --> 38:39.556
[chanting continues]

38:43.488 --> 38:46.855
There's no way
the hacker's a student, okay?

38:46.908 --> 38:51.572
He's probably just some like 20-something,
disgruntled-ass loner IT dude

38:51.621 --> 38:54.704
who jacks off to Fight Club in his
mom's basement like every night.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.831
Oh, my God.
Brad Pitt's abs? I can't.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.832
[boy] Why would he come
for Turrell?

38:58.878 --> 39:00.618
[Em] Motive's irrelevant.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.130
What's the motive behind
300 mass shootings every year?

39:04.175 --> 39:06.507
There is none.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.863
People just burn out, want to
take down their little universe.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.549
I just had this scary thought
that, like...

39:11.558 --> 39:14.925
we're all characters onThe Sims
and none of us know it.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.476
[boy] Porn taught me
how to fuck.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.978
But that's the problem.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.059
You think it taught you
how to fuck...

39:21.484 --> 39:23.349
It didn't.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.549
This is why every guy I meet on Tinder
wants to choke me on our first date.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.565
[scoffs] I learned how to eat
pussy by watching porn.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.357
[girls laugh]

39:31.411 --> 39:33.322
Just by looking in your eyes,

39:33.371 --> 39:35.971
I can tell that you don't know the
first thing about eating pussy.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.619
Whatever.
Guess you'll never know.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.586
Tragic.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.995
What about you, Mark?

39:44.007 --> 39:46.464
What?
[Bex] Like eating pussy?

39:48.511 --> 39:49.876
[clears throat] Yeah.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.548
Yeah, I do.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.463
Is that true, Lil?

39:55.894 --> 39:57.555
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.612
[whispers] You are such a bitch.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.199
I'm not a bitch. I'm a feminist.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.679
[Mark] Do you think it's cool
to be a slut?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.085
Huh?

40:23.046 --> 40:24.377
Keep going.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.334
It's fucking obvious
that you said something to Bex.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.675
Keep going.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.135
I don't know about, like,
me going down on you.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.920
Yeah, about the fact
that you haven't?

40:34.933 --> 40:37.800
What, do you think it's cool
to fucking tell your friends?

40:38.102 --> 40:40.514
Let me ask you something, Mark.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.556
You think if I never went down on you,
you might mention it to Mason?

40:44.943 --> 40:47.400
Matter of fact, I wouldn't.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.299
I'd just bring it up to you.
I'd be like, "Hey, Lily, why don't you suck my dick?"

40:50.323 --> 40:52.109
Hey, Mark,
why don't you eat my pussy?

40:52.158 --> 40:54.490
Because I'm really fucking angry
at you right now.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.614
[scoffs] How fucking convenient.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.994
[Lily] Mark was the first guy
I ever had sex with,

41:03.169 --> 41:05.626
that I ever snuck out
of my house to meet,

41:05.964 --> 41:07.920
that told me I was beautiful,

41:08.216 --> 41:09.126
that I was smart.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.585
Fuck you, Lily!

41:11.552 --> 41:13.884
Fuck you.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.407
- [Lily] That he missed me.
- [Mark] You think you're so fucking cool. Huh?

41:15.431 --> 41:17.387
All the fucking time
in your little fucking skirt

41:17.433 --> 41:18.661
and your little fucking panties.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.550
[Lily] That he wanted me.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.873
Outside, dancing with Sarah, with
your tits out and your ass out,

41:22.897 --> 41:24.558
you look fucking ridiculous.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.768
[Lily] That he loved me.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.458
You think you're any different than
any fucking whore on Instagram?

41:29.737 --> 41:33.400
Do you think anyone cares about
what the fuck you have to say?

41:33.449 --> 41:37.192
[Lily] He was the first guy who ever
made me feel good about being me.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.157
You should have
some fucking self-respect.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.533
[Lily] And the first guy
that I ever wanted to hurt back.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.929
[Mark] Don't cry, don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay? Hey, you shouldn't cry.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.801
I'm a little drunk.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.640
[received text tone]

42:09.193 --> 42:11.104
[Mark] You're fucking beautiful
when you cry.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.044
- [kissing sounds]
- [heavy breathing]

42:31.966 --> 42:33.422
[instrumental music playing]

43:12.215 --> 43:13.500
[door opens]

43:13.549 --> 43:14.735
[woman] Hon, when are you
coming to bed?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.590
[man clears throat] In a bit.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.294
I have some stuff to finish up.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.509
Okay, well, uh,
just don't forget that

43:22.558 --> 43:24.161
you have to take Carlie
to dance in the morning.

43:24.185 --> 43:25.595
Oh, right, yeah.
Okay?

43:25.645 --> 43:27.260
I'll come to bed soon.
Okay, love you.

43:28.356 --> 43:30.642
[door shuts]
Love you more.

43:37.740 --> 43:38.740
[soft moaning]

43:45.498 --> 43:46.783
[distorted audio]

43:53.381 --> 43:54.917
We're gonna start
with tweets here

43:54.966 --> 43:58.333
in which you used
the hashtag "we are legion."

43:59.971 --> 44:03.463
That would seem to insinuate that you're
a member of the hacker group Anonymous.

44:03.516 --> 44:06.053
[laughs] No, I'm not.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.638
No, I just... I'm a supporter.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.308
A supporter? Why?

44:12.733 --> 44:14.473
'Cause they're bad-ass.

44:14.527 --> 44:17.314
And they can do shit that, like,
no offense, but the police...

44:17.738 --> 44:19.899
[clears throat] police can't do.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.360
Do you think this is a game?

44:22.785 --> 44:25.948
Ruining peoples' lives,
do you get your kicks from this?

44:25.997 --> 44:27.157
[laughs]

44:27.790 --> 44:29.371
Look up at me
when I'm talking to you.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.498
You know,
it just occurred to me...

44:31.836 --> 44:33.997
You ought to be careful
going after this guy.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.006
Why is that?

44:36.924 --> 44:39.882
I'd think about whether or not
you have anything to hide.

44:40.595 --> 44:41.755
[Patterson] Is that a threat?

44:42.013 --> 44:43.799
It sure sounded like
a threat to me.

44:44.473 --> 44:47.886
Look, I'm just playing this out
to its logical conclusion.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.495
- [phone vibrates]
- [text message ding]

44:50.146 --> 44:52.506
[officer] Your conclusion is
coming real soon. [phone dings]

44:53.232 --> 44:54.688
[laughs loudly]

44:54.734 --> 44:55.849
[more text message dings]

44:56.652 --> 44:59.234
Looks like half of Salem
just got hacked.

45:00.281 --> 45:01.737
[phone slides across table]

45:02.325 --> 45:03.405
[message dings continue]

45:04.827 --> 45:05.987
[Patterson sighs]

45:06.787 --> 45:07.787
[text message ding]

45:12.501 --> 45:13.661
[received text tone]

45:41.614 --> 45:44.651
[Lily moaning on video]

45:50.665 --> 45:51.665
[received message tone]

45:53.209 --> 45:54.244
[received message tone]

45:57.171 --> 45:58.206
[received message tone]

45:58.256 --> 45:59.256
[sniffling]

46:19.193 --> 46:20.979
[sobbing]

46:25.199 --> 46:26.385
- [received message tone]
- [Lily sobs]

46:26.409 --> 46:27.945
[Bex] But how did it start?

46:29.245 --> 46:31.281
I was babysitting for him.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.952
And afterwards,
he'd always give me a ride home.

46:38.421 --> 46:43.165
The only guys that have ever been
into me were like dumb 16-year-olds.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.966
In the car rides home, he'd...

46:46.804 --> 46:51.343
ask me all these questions that
I've never been asked before.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.808
And he'd listen to what I'd say.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.058
And we never actually hooked up.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.478
There was one thing
that happened...

47:03.571 --> 47:06.859
where he put his hand
on my thigh one time.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.240
And I just melted.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.703
Then I freaked out.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.910
You know, 'cause of...

47:22.048 --> 47:27.042
Carlie and Rose and just
seeing them all the time, and...

47:28.262 --> 47:30.218
I quit babysitting.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.848
Then one night he texted me.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.557
And I wrote back.

47:39.398 --> 47:42.890
But you're 18
and he's, like, 40.

47:44.695 --> 47:48.313
I know,
but I really liked him, Bex.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.445
[softly] He has kids.

47:53.496 --> 47:56.954
- I'm not a bad person, Bex.
- I know, I know.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.119
I love you.

48:02.088 --> 48:03.578
I love you, too.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.125
No matter what.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.962
No matter what.

48:38.707 --> 48:39.947
Have a good day!

48:44.380 --> 48:47.747
[Lily] I read this quote from
this writer whose name I forget.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.175
[phone clicks]

48:52.221 --> 48:53.586
But it said something like,

48:56.392 --> 48:58.929
ten percent
of the population is cruel.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.476
[received text tone]

49:06.068 --> 49:07.979
And, like, ten percent
is merciful.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.028
[received text tone]

49:19.665 --> 49:23.624
And the other 80% can be
swayed in either direction.

49:27.715 --> 49:31.958
I'm also pretty sure that that writer
has never seen a WorldStar fight vid.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.967
Or 4chan or Twitter.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.265
[loud grunt]

49:39.143 --> 49:43.477
Or had their best friend share their
nudes with her boyfriend, and in turn,

49:43.522 --> 49:45.683
the entire fucking school.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.439
[Johnny] Yeah, fuck Diamond.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.245
I can't fucking believe
he sucked Bex's dick.

49:49.278 --> 49:50.484
It's disgusting.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.188
I'm still gagging. I used to
share drinks with that fucker.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.279
[Lily]
But it is scary to think about.

49:58.579 --> 50:00.410
Because you don't know
who's who.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.081
Or how easily
they can be swayed.

50:06.462 --> 50:07.918
And at the end of the day,

50:08.964 --> 50:11.546
nothing unites us
like a good tragedy.

50:14.303 --> 50:16.543
[athlete 1] Did you hear when
he's coming back to school?

50:17.306 --> 50:18.306
No.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.674
I give him, like, five days
before he commits suicide.

50:23.395 --> 50:24.805
I would.

50:29.318 --> 50:30.808
[Lily]
And the worse it gets,

50:31.487 --> 50:33.853
the more entertaining
it is for you,

50:36.075 --> 50:37.281
this high school,

50:37.910 --> 50:39.400
this bullshit town,

50:40.287 --> 50:41.777
and the rest of the world.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.070
Can I go to the bathroom?

50:43.874 --> 50:45.705
[Johnny] He's being a little
fucking bitch.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.453
We should do
something about that.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.087
I'll drive.

50:52.508 --> 50:53.839
- I'm in.
- Come on, man.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.169
I'm fucking in.

50:55.844 --> 50:56.844
[athlete 2] Me too.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.553
- You in? Yeah?
- Let's fuckin' do it.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.759
What about you?
You?

51:02.226 --> 51:03.261
You fucking in?

51:03.811 --> 51:04.891
You in?

51:05.312 --> 51:06.665
How about you fucking pussies,
you in?

51:06.689 --> 51:07.749
- Yeah!
- Teach Diamond a lesson?

51:07.773 --> 51:08.933
[athlete 3] Let's do it.

51:08.983 --> 51:10.564
[Johnny] Hey, gentlemen.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.520
[clears throat]
What do they call us?

51:12.987 --> 51:14.568
[athletes]
Slay 'em High Killas!

51:15.406 --> 51:18.318
[Johnny] I'm sorry, I'm sorry... What do they...
What do they call us?

51:18.367 --> 51:19.927
[athletes, louder]
Slay 'em High Killas!

51:19.952 --> 51:21.408
[Johnny]
What do they call us?

51:22.663 --> 51:24.654
What do they fucking call us?

51:25.124 --> 51:26.660
Slay 'em High Killas!

51:26.709 --> 51:28.700
Fuck these pussies!
Fuck these faggots!

51:54.069 --> 51:55.980
[Lily] 'Cause it's all
just a movie, right?

52:15.633 --> 52:18.090
[Lily] Hey, what's up?

52:18.719 --> 52:20.425
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

52:21.639 --> 52:22.639
What?

52:27.227 --> 52:28.667
Do you have a birthmark
on your back?

52:30.564 --> 52:31.804
- No.
- No?

52:33.275 --> 52:34.606
You sure about that, Lily?

52:35.611 --> 52:36.646
Yeah.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.071
[laughs] You're lying.

52:38.572 --> 52:39.857
You're fucking lying.

52:40.616 --> 52:41.616
Show me.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.566
No.

52:43.619 --> 52:45.575
[metal bat dragging on ground]

52:52.670 --> 52:53.670
[sharp clang]

52:55.381 --> 52:56.621
[cheerleaders scream]

52:57.299 --> 52:59.836
[bat clatters]

53:03.263 --> 53:04.423
[bat continues rolling]

53:07.101 --> 53:09.137
[gasps] What the fuck!

53:09.186 --> 53:11.472
- What the fuck are you doing?
- [Mason] Stop fighting.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.333
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Stop fucking fighting, Lily.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.143
What the fuck are you doing?

53:15.567 --> 53:17.023
[Mark shushing]

53:17.069 --> 53:18.229
I want to tell you something.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.904
When I looked through all the
photos in Nick Mathers' leak,

53:23.117 --> 53:24.482
I started to think to myself,

53:26.370 --> 53:28.281
"This girl looks
pretty fucking familiar."

53:28.831 --> 53:30.071
[Lily] Don't do this.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.205
What do you think, Lily?

53:35.504 --> 53:36.504
Lily.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.290
- [Lily sobs]
- Look familiar?

53:39.091 --> 53:41.047
- No.
- [Mark] It doesn't, huh?

53:41.719 --> 53:43.530
- [voice breaking] Get off me.
- [Mark] That's what I thought.

53:43.554 --> 53:46.136
I thought there's no fucking way
this could be Lily.

53:46.181 --> 53:48.467
- My little Lily.
- Get the fuck off me.

53:49.643 --> 53:50.883
I just wanna make sure.

53:53.814 --> 53:57.727
So turn around, be a nice
little girl, and show me.

53:58.819 --> 54:00.650
Show me
you're telling the truth.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.232
- Show it.
- Get the fuck off me.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.568
All right.

54:05.617 --> 54:08.199
[Lily gasps]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.926
- [sobbing]
- Hold her down, hold her down.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.413
Oh, look. Hold it, hold it.

54:13.459 --> 54:15.324
Yup, there it is!
[laughs]

54:15.836 --> 54:17.542
- [Lily sobs]
- Here.

54:19.882 --> 54:21.122
Wow!

54:23.844 --> 54:26.284
Turn her face around. Let me get
her face in the fucking shot.

54:26.805 --> 54:28.966
Is it wrong that
I'm actually enjoying this?

54:29.016 --> 54:31.598
Didn't you used to
fucking babysit his kids?

54:31.643 --> 54:34.555
- Get off me. I don't know. Get off me!
- [Mark] You listen to me.

54:34.605 --> 54:37.221
Now you listen to me.
You fucking humiliated me.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.811
Now it's my turn
to humiliate you.

54:40.235 --> 54:43.853
I'm going to show the whole fucking
world what a dirty whore you are.

54:44.406 --> 54:45.646
Stop fucking crying.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.236
Stop fucking feeling sorry
for yourself.

54:48.827 --> 54:50.283
There's gonna be no sympathy
for you.

54:50.329 --> 54:52.194
You brought this
on your fucking self.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.321

54:57.044 --> 54:58.625
[Lily sobs]

54:58.670 --> 55:00.150
[Mark]
Let's get the fuck out of here.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.629
[Lily continues sobbing]

55:06.345 --> 55:08.506
[Mark] The world's gonna know!

55:28.325 --> 55:31.613
[camera shutter clicking]

55:34.373 --> 55:37.365
[clicking accelerates]

55:41.296 --> 55:43.816
The weird thing is, you don't know
how many people have seen it.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.790
You could have them saved
on your computer right now.

55:46.844 --> 55:49.256
You can look them up
after I leave

55:49.304 --> 55:52.091
and share them with
who-the-fuck-ever you want to.

55:53.100 --> 55:56.638
My entire life,
every room that I walk into,

55:56.687 --> 56:00.145
every job interview
or first date,

56:00.899 --> 56:03.561
I'll have that sinking feeling
in my stomach.

56:05.988 --> 56:07.569
So I made a promise.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.151
If I ever found out
who did this to me,

56:10.200 --> 56:12.862
I would hurt them
as much as they hurt me.

56:12.911 --> 56:14.117
[students cheering]

56:14.162 --> 56:15.368
Is that the right thing to do?

56:16.164 --> 56:19.531
I don't know. Don't tell me
it's not justifiable.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.417
It's not like
I fucking killed her.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.293
[phone dings]

56:27.926 --> 56:29.917
[dinging continues]

56:34.433 --> 56:36.515

56:38.937 --> 56:40.552
Fuck me!

56:51.533 --> 56:52.533
[Lawrence] Lillian.

56:54.912 --> 56:55.912
What?

56:56.705 --> 56:58.745
I can't... No, I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

56:59.291 --> 57:01.623
Lily, come back here.

57:03.211 --> 57:04.371
Lily?

57:06.548 --> 57:08.129
[Lily] I can't do it right now.

57:08.842 --> 57:09.842
[Rebecca] Lily?

57:10.385 --> 57:11.215
[Lawrence] Lillian.

57:11.261 --> 57:12.592
[doors slamming]

57:15.933 --> 57:17.139
Lily?

57:21.229 --> 57:23.374
- I want to ask you a question, Lily.
- Let's not do this now...

57:23.398 --> 57:26.105
I just want to talk to you.
I want to ask you a question.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.688
And I want you
to be honest with me.

57:28.737 --> 57:31.215
- Lily. Lily, look at me.
- [softly] Jesus, please don't do this, please.

57:31.239 --> 57:32.820
Lily, I just... I...

57:33.492 --> 57:35.153
I want to know the truth.

57:35.202 --> 57:38.410
Is... Was that you in the photos
on Nick Mathers' phone?

57:39.289 --> 57:41.643
- Lily, look at me. Lily? Look at me.
- Please, don't do this.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.532
This is a simple question
I'm asking you.

57:43.585 --> 57:45.576
I am begging you.
Don't do this.

57:45.629 --> 57:48.416
Is that you
in those photos? Lily?

57:50.801 --> 57:52.211
Lily, I just want
to know the truth.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.216
Is this you?
Did you do this?

57:54.262 --> 57:56.449
[voice breaking] Stop, stop, stop.
Just stop. Please stop.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.963
- Lily.
- Stop.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.881
I'm your mother. I...

57:59.935 --> 58:02.551
You... you are my daughter.
I have spent 18... Look at me.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.845
I have spent 18 years
raising you.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.684
I just want to know the truth.

58:06.733 --> 58:08.940
- Is that you in those photos?
- Dad?

58:08.986 --> 58:10.817
[Lawrence]
Answer the question, Lily.

58:19.037 --> 58:20.037
Yes.

58:21.873 --> 58:22.873
Yes.

58:23.291 --> 58:24.622
- It's you.
- Yes.

58:26.461 --> 58:27.826
What is wrong with you?

58:29.464 --> 58:31.250
What is wrong with you?

58:32.634 --> 58:34.499
How could you do that?

58:34.553 --> 58:36.656
- Now get up. Get up.
- No, please don't make me do this.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.511
Get up right now! Come on.

- I don't want to go.

58:39.850 --> 58:42.262
- [Lily] I love you! I love you!
- No.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.205
- Please, I'm so sorry. I love you!
- [Rebecca] Get up. Stand up.

58:44.229 --> 58:47.096
- No, Mom, I'm gonna get up. Please!
- Stand up! Go.

58:47.149 --> 58:49.185
Dad, please! Please, Dad!

58:49.234 --> 58:51.816
- It's not possible.
- Please let me stay! Don't do this.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.898
Don't do this,
don't do this, don't...

Salem's number one slut.

59:52.214 --> 59:54.546
- Say what's up, Lily!
- [Lily] Leave me the fuck alone.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.173
Say hi, baby. Say hi.

59:57.219 --> 59:59.447
- Can you blow us a kiss, Lily?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:02.075
I know she likes to use her mouth.
I don't know what the problem is.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.160
- Leave me the fuck alone...
- Come on, Lily, blow us a kiss, baby.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.766
[Lily] Leave me the fuck alone.
Leave me the fuck alone.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.414
- What's that, bitch?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.553
Leave me the fuck alone.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.542
You think any man's
ever gonna wanna fuck

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.308

after Googling you?

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.316
Your life is over.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.522
You ought to just...

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.633
take what you can get
where you can get it.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:19.817
You know what I'm saying?

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.071
- So come on and get it, bitch.
- Fuck you.

think you're going, Lily?

Hey, the harder you make me work, the
harder I'm gonna make you hurt, bitch!

[Ennio Morricone's
"Violenza lnattesa" plays]

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.126
[Lily] So here's the thing
that really bothers me.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.003
Who sees a naked photo of a girl
and their first thought is,

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.387
"Yo, I gotta kill this bitch"?

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:28.475
Turns out,

than you'd think.

a little desensitized to violence.

And mobs.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.983

or complicit.

is laughing at us,

in our humiliation.

Well, somebody did it, Marty.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.113
And if it wasn't you,
then who was it?

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.612
You need to give us a name.

- I'm not.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.642
- You wear a dress on our date.
- [man 2 on TV laughs]

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:47.307
[woman on TV] And if I win?
So do you.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360
[sent text tone]

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.784
[received text tone]

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:00.998
[sent text tone]

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.220
[upbeat fight music plays]

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:33.937
[Em] When I grow up, I wanna be a director
and only make male rape revenge films.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.447
Like Deliverance?
Ew, no. That's gross.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.653
I want it to be sexy.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.114
Like, if someone
remade Straw Dogs,

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.516
but instead of Susan George getting raped,
Dustin Hoffman gets raped.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.407
[Bex] Why hasn't Nancy Meyers,
like, made that already?

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.291
If life were a movie,

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.749
this would be the obligatory
"girl shaves her head" scene.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.458
Def.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.124
Actually, no, that would've
happened, like, last week.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:58.671
This would be, like, "girl burns this
motherfucking town to the ground" scene.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.088
That would be dope.

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:02.465
Girl, I'm glad
this isn't a movie, though.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.511
'Cause if it was, you would
definitely die at the end.

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.554
Why the fuck do I gotta die?

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:10.002
'Cause the slut's gotta go, baby.
"'Cause the slut's gotta go."

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:10.890
Fuck you, guys.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.104
What the fuck?

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.027
[Lily] What? Are you guys
seeing this right now?

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.564
[Em] What now?
Marty Kolker uploaded a video.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.069
[Marty on phone]
My name is Marty Kolker.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.657
I'm not Erostratus.
This wasn't my idea.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.959
But after Mayor Bartlett's
information was leaked,

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.996
I started to monitor the
amount of data being uploaded

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:37.087
and downloaded from each IP
address in and around Salem.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.544
There was one that stood out.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:42.513
Lily Colson's.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:48.265
I then confronted her about it at school.
What the fuck?

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:50.979
She not only admitted
to being behind the hack,

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:53.141
but she also said
that if I didn't help her...

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.979
She said that
if I didn't help her,

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.425
she would release
all my personal information,

01:07:58.449 --> 01:07:59.859
as well as my father's.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.362
[sobbing]
I'm so sorry.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.119
I was scared. I didn't know
what else to do. I'm so sorry.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.370
Why would he say that?

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.812
[Bex] No, this is fucked up.
[Lily] I don't even know how to do this.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.748
How can he just say that
without showing any proof

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.900
that that even happened?
[Em] Did he just make that shit up?

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.777
Or is, like... Is it really
coming from your house?

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.631
[Bex] Oh, shit.
[Sarah] This isn't good.

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:19.863
[Bex]
Everyone's tweeting about it.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.798
How many people
are gonna believe this?

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.728
How many people are gonna
think that I did this?

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.590
Did Mom set the alarm, Sarah?

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.801
[Sarah] Uh, I don't know.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:29.678
[Em] I think I should go check.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:43.868
Did you set the alarm?

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.527
[Nance] I think so, why?

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.162
I feel anxious. I don't know.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.578
[Nance] You... You want a Xanax?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.375
No.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.305
[automated voice]
Zone Four arming.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:16.060
Cannot arm.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.189
[Em] Mom, what's Zone Four?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.145
[Nance] The glass sliding doors.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.779

- [rustling]

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.883

[thumping, cracks]

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:55.555
[breathing heavily]

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:58.985
[Nance] Sarah?

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.945
Is everything okay?
Uh, no, not really.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.397
Well, can I help?

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.450
No, it's fine.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.701
[automated voice]
Bypass Zone Four.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:13.750
[Sarah] Em?

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:16.034
Em?

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:22.419
[gunman] Quiet.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.754

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.682
Zone Six cannot arm.

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:07.548
[shrieks]

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.219
[in a hiss] I know your mom has guns here.
Where are they?

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.429
[mumbles]
Where?

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.394
Upstairs.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:52.597
[gunmen whispering]

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.877
[Lily] I know you both
hate me right now.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:35.507
And you probably just saw that
video, and you believe it.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.644
That I really need you to know
that it's not true.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.848
Because I wouldn't hurt people
like this.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:48.020
And because of everything that's happened,
I know you're not gonna to believe that.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.324
But... I thought you should
hear it from me directly.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.739
I didn't do this.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:00.372
I... I wouldn't wish this
upon anyone.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:08.373
And I know that I've made some mistakes,
but I'm... I'm not a bad person.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:16.718
I miss you a lot. And I really
just want to come home.

You know how
they ruined our town.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.477
Are we gonna sit back
and let them get away with it?

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:40.736

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:43.022

We're not going anywhere, Lily.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.074
You can hide all you want.

But we're gonna
fucking find you, bitch.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:00.377

[panting]
[Nick] Quick.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:25.781
We have to move.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.858
They can't see us here, okay?

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.617
You can't be here.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:31.289
Lily.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.539
[sobs] They killed Nance.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:35.825
They killed Nance,
and they took Sarah and Em.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.327
And they're gonna come for me!
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.254
Okay? Let's go upstairs.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.665
I can't move.
Come here. Up.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:46.881
Come here, come here.
[continues sobbing]

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.315
Hi, hey.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.995
You're okay. They probably just
took them to the police station.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:02.415
We're gonna help, okay?
I promise.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.039
I'm so scared.
I know.

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:08.255
The whole fucking world
has lost its mind.

I don't know...

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.350
Lily...
It's okay. I can do it.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.060
Lily, Lily.
I can do it.

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:25.608
It is gonna be okay.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.275
[whispers] You are safe now.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:34.777
I'll take care of you.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:38.572
I will protect you.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.456
God, you're beautiful.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:47.675

[Nick]
You fell in love with me.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.765
Did you think
I was in love with you?

01:20:58.395 --> 01:20:59.475
That's why you did this.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:06.897
[whispering] I would never
ever do something like this.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:15.110
Tell the fucking truth.

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:24.410
All this pain and chaos, Lily...

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:26.255
[Lily gasps]

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.253
[breathing shortens] And I
never even got to fuck you.

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:37.598
No, no, no, no...

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:38.976
Kiss me.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.138
[whimpers]

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:43.429
Please...
Kiss. Me.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:45.726
Don't hurt me.

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:55.899
[Johnny]
First, we're gonna kill you.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.702
Then the Lacey sisters.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.125
And then...

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:05.121
we're gonna kill
that slut Lily Colson.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.958
Hey, pussy. Get over here.
Tie her up, let's go.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.402
[Diamond]
I'm so sorry, Bex.

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.323
No...

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.529
[voice breaking]
No, no, no, no...

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.122
[Bex sobbing]

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:44.081
Please don't do this...

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:45.366
I don't have a choice.

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:47.208
I'm begging you.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:50.746
This isn't you.
You're not like this.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.633
Please don't do this.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.549
[exhaling sharply]

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.554
You want to kiss me, Daddy?

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.610
Yes.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:14.603
You want to touch me, Daddy?

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.487
Yes.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.451
You want to fuck me, Daddy?

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.081
Yes.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.577
You promise to be gentle?

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:34.217
I promise.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.487
[Nick shrieks]

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.034
[clattering]

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.037
Bitch!

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:07.156
Damn it, Lily!
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:08.915
Open the fucking door, Lily!

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:10.534
[screams]

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:11.667
[pounding on door]

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.712
[screaming]

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:19.092
Lily, it was a fucking mistake.
Open the fucking door.

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:21.466
Open the fucking door, Lily!

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.631
Open the door.

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:28.685
It is not what it looks like,
Lily. I didn't kill him.

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:31.434
What the fuck are you doing?
Open it up.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.187
Open the fucking door, Lily.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.399
Goddammit, Lily,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.865
I have lost everything, okay?
I have nothing.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:45.160
Open the door right now
or I'm leaving.

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:48.242
I need you to open the door
right fucking now!

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:49.747
Right now!

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:54.711
Open this fucking door,
you little shit.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.917
[banging]

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.541
Open the fucking door!

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.131
- [lock pops]
- [exclaims]

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.182
[knife slashes]

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:18.602
[gagging]

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.317
[gasping]

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:29.624
[head bumps floor]

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:35.165
[straining, gasping]

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.228
[sobbing]

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.865
[whispering] I'm so scared.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.698
I don't want to die here.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.120
[sobbing]
This isn't you, Diamond.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:22.207
I'm not gonna do it.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:23.671
I'm not gonna tie her up.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.960
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:28.676
Look at your life.
She... She ruined it.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.637
She humiliated you.

01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:41.153
No.

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:43.900
She didn't humiliate me.
You did.

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:53.446
[Johnny]
Tie her up.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.491
[Diamond]
No. Fuck you.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:58.994
You're not a hero, Diamond.

01:27:03.176 --> 01:27:04.586
[grunts]
[thuds]

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.297
One of you motherfuckers
grab him.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:08.116
Bring him out in the street.
Let's hang this bitch.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.677
Let's get this show
on the fucking road, boys!

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.064
[Richter over loudspeaker]
Patriotic citizens.

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.049
Anybody with information

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:58.721
leading to the whereabouts
or capture of Lily Colson...

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:04.564
will not only be looked upon as a
hero amongst the good people of Salem

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:07.229
but will be
most handsomely rewarded.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:25.084
What the fuck?

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:32.299
[Richter over loudspeaker]
Beware, we're gonna find you.

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.222
It's not just me looking.

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:38.431
It's the town. It's the FBI.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.350
So you best do the right thing.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.229
Make it easy on yourself.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.400
I'm telling you.
She didn't fucking do this.

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.444
[Richter]
You tell that to the FBI.

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:54.192
They confirmed Marty's story

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.737
about the amount of data
that Lily was uploading.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:28:59.489
Then why aren't they here?

01:29:11.137 --> 01:29:12.343
[tires screech]

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.466
Who the fuck is that?

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:21.432
Lily, he's gonna kill you!

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:31.893
You sure you even know how to
hold that thing, little girl?

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:41.052
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill a cop?

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:42.825
[Em] Lily!

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:45.449
You aren't allowed
to shoot a cop.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.210
- [groans]
- [both scream]

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:50.339

[body thuds]

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:01.059
Em! Sarah!

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:02.344
[Sarah whimpering]

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:04.892
Lily...

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:06.272
[Lily] Are you okay?
[Em] Yeah.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.899
[Lily]
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:10.310
- [Sarah] I love you.
- Are you okay? I love you.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.149
I love you both so much.

01:30:12.198 --> 01:30:13.563
[all crying]

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:16.450
They killed her.
They fucking killed Nance.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.698
Where's Bex?

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.099
- [engine starts]
- [Johnny] Let's fucking go!

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.079
[tires screeching]
[engine revving]

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.824
Sarah!

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:28.707
[Johnny, indistinct]

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:31.419
Let's go!
Slay 'em High, motherfuckers!

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:40.848
Why?

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:42.884
[screaming]

01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:54.438
[Johnny] Film this shit.
We gotta show everybody.

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.948
- [athlete] Yeah!
- [Johnny] Spin those tires.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:59.484
Slay 'em High,
all right, boys?

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:03.121
Don't fuck around! Finish it!
Keep going!

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:09.085
- [horn blares]
- [tires screeching]

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.246
[choking]

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.422
[all yelling]

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:46.364
Dude, they're fucking crazy.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.422
I'm gonna take
these bitches out.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:31:59.586
[shouting]

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:08.102
Fuck this! Fuck!

01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:33.461
If you wanna surrender,
we'll stop shooting.

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:36.508
[Johnny]
Fuck you, cunts!

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:40.426
[weapons cocking]

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:51.148
You're good?

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.894
Yeah.
Fuck!

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.197
Fuck.

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:12.579
Son of a bitch.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:16.090
Okay.

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:19.590
Okay, all right,
I-I surrender. Don't shoot!

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:21.714
[pistol clatters]

01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:23.337
Don't shoot, please.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:25.221
[Lily] Get on your knees.

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:29.221
- Get on your fucking knees!
- Okay.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:36.607
Don't kill me, please.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.530
I...

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:41.438
Pl-Please don't kill me.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:50.371
Bex, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, please.

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.366
[whispers]
Please don't kill me.

01:33:54.838 --> 01:33:56.624
All right, I didn't...
I didn't mean it.

01:33:57.090 --> 01:34:00.628
God, please, Bex. Please, I'm begging you.
Don't fucking kill me.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.757
Please!

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.422
Look... Look, it was fucking
stupid, all right? I know.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:10.162
All right? I'm sorry for everything.
I regret everything.

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:12.768
I got carried away. I'm sorry.
Please don't fucking kill me.

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:16.518
Please.

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:18.520
Hey.

01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:21.443
Please don't fucking kill me.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:32.666
Let's go.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.423
Thank you.
[Bex] Mm-hmm.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:51.633
You okay?
Uh, yeah.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:54.469
[Diamond] You okay?
[Bex] Yeah.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:35:00.316
Thanks for not murdering me,
I guess.

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:01.646
- [chuckles]
- You're welcome.

01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:04.781
You should go.

01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:06.481
Yeah.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.320
Yeah, I should.
Yeah.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.449
Okay.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.582
[exhales]

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:21.246
I mean, uh...

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:22.883
Not all men.

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:23.926
[laughs]

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:29.137
[Bex] I don't know what
I'd do without you guys.

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:30.342
[kissing]

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:35.765
[Lily] My name is Lily Colson.
I'm 18 years old.

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:39.598
And I don't know if me and my friends
are gonna live through the night.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.603
This entire fucking town
wants to kill us.

01:35:46.115 --> 01:35:49.653
And they may say that it's because
they thought I was behind it

01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:51.284
or that I'm a whore,

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.694
I'm immoral, I'm a homewrecker,

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.703
I deserve it, I have it coming.

01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:57.745
Well, guess what?
I didn't hack anybody's shit.

01:35:57.794 --> 01:35:59.830
I didn't do it.
And I don't know who did.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.870
As for being a whore,

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:05.210
a homewrecker, immoral?

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.420
Sure.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.920
It doesn't hold a fucking candle
to your righteousness.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.055
That's the real sickness here,

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.262
your righteousness
and hypocrisy.

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:20.347
It's the simple fact that you
can't live by the rules you set,

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.106
yet you still pretend.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.226
This is your world.
You built this.

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:28.570
If it's too strict,
tear it the fuck down.

01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:30.944
But don't look at me.

01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:34.743
Don't take your hate out on me.
I just got here.

01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:37.947
[distant gunfire]

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:40.788
And I have no clue where to go,

01:36:40.837 --> 01:36:44.705
because from the moment I arrived,
all I was ever given were orders.

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:47.047
Smile.
