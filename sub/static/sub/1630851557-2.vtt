WEBVTT

00:20.354 --> 00:21.772
Pay attention, Hugo.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.982
Watch me hit my neighbor's yacht.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.362
They keep having loud parties
late at night.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.405
It drives me crazy

00:31.156 --> 00:32.406
that they never invite me.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.289
-Did you hit it?
-Nope.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.333
I hit my own yacht.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.168
Such is life.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.004
It doesn't always turn out
the way you expect.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.756
Let me guess.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.884
The next part of your story
is gonna teach me that lesson?

00:50.968 --> 00:53.387
No, no, no.
This is a completely different lesson.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.347
No matter what task you have,

00:55.430 --> 00:58.851
to succeed, it takes a village.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.812
Right. A village. Lesson learned.
Can I have a turn at hitting the golf--

01:01.895 --> 01:04.147
I had been working
at Las Colinas a few weeks.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.234
I was feeling on top of the world.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.446
And as always,
extremely handsome.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.033
Sarape.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.578
It pains me
that you'll be by yourself all day

01:17.661 --> 01:19.955
now that both Mom and I
are working the weekend.

01:20.998 --> 01:21.999
Sure you'll be okay?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.585
Somehow I'll find a way to survive.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.129
Want a cigarette?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.840
Those snobs fired me.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.049
Can you believe it?

01:33.135 --> 01:34.344
Forgive me, Mother Mary.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.140
I took the bus all the way to Las Playas
only for them to fire me.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.641
They say it's because I don't see well.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.352
-Oh, no. That's so unfair, Mom.
-Oh, no. You're gonna be here all day?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.606
So I told them, "No, you're the ones
who can't see straight, all right?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.024
I wear glasses now."

01:47.941 --> 01:50.110
But they're still upset
about what happened last time.

01:50.194 --> 01:51.320
They're so picky.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.823
I mean, hey, anybody could
confuse bleach for carpet cleaner.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.951
I swear that filthy Persian rug
looks better white anyway!

02:06.835 --> 02:09.838
I can't believe my mom
just lost another job.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.758
Even with her new glasses,
her sight is getting worse.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.928
I gotta find a way to make money faster.

02:17.179 --> 02:21.016
You always come out ahead.
You're Máximo Gallardo.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.227
When you were ten years old,

02:23.310 --> 02:26.146
you sold those misprinted T-shirts
that said, "Apaculco."

02:27.523 --> 02:29.483
You see the bright side of everything,
don't you?

02:29.566 --> 02:31.568
It's one of my best traits.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.404
That and my enchanting gaze.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.453
I'm very sorry, amigos.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.331
Wow, sweet motorcycle.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.668
How can Héctor afford
a motorcycle that nice?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.295
He has your same job.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.423
Don Pablo, do you have a second?

02:54.550 --> 02:56.927
English, please. And make it quick.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.220
Yes.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.264
I'd like your opinion on something.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.599
Why do I always get low-paying customers

03:02.683 --> 03:04.852
while Héctor always finds
the big spenders?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.563
Héctor doesn't find the biggest spenders.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.022
He creates them.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.152
Oh, he creates them. Of course.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.740
I should have known, uh--
So smart. So, so smart.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.993
-You don't understand.
-Not a clue.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.995
Follow me.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.843
So I turned to Chuck Norris and tell him,

03:37.926 --> 03:41.054
"I'm not gonna say anything to her.
She could kick both our asses."

03:43.974 --> 03:46.852
Hey, Don Pablo. What can I do for you?

03:46.935 --> 03:50.397
Beto, how has Máximo been doing
here at the pool?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.858
Well, no one, and I mean, no one

03:52.941 --> 03:56.361
gets our guests more iced teas
and lemonades than this guy right here.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.989
Don't smile, kid. It's an insult.

04:00.657 --> 04:05.287
Máximo, do you know how much money
we make selling lemonade?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.207
Peanuts, Máximo. Peanuts.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.083
Yes, talk to me. I'm here for you.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.044
Here. Watch Héctor.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.670
Chips and salsa. You got it.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.548
Now, how about we throw in
a couple mango margaritas

04:16.632 --> 04:18.634
and make this a real vacation, eh?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.969
-That sounds delicious.
-That's the spirit.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.721
I don't usually offer this to everyone,

04:22.804 --> 04:26.934
but I can tell that you both have very,
very, very, very, very refined palates.

04:27.017 --> 04:32.481
So, how does the owner's
top-shelf reserve reposado sound?

04:33.857 --> 04:34.900
Just for you.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.151
Yeah, sounds good.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.611
My heart rest easy.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.740
Coming right up.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.369
And remember, Máximo,

04:45.869 --> 04:47.829
our guests have a lot of money.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.998
They want the resort experience,

04:50.499 --> 04:53.001
and sometimes it helps
to remind them of that.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.256
I had my mission.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.342
If the resort experience
was what the guests wanted,

05:00.425 --> 05:03.345
then that's what I was going to give them.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.429
So…

05:04.513 --> 05:07.391
…your job was to convince people
to spend more money?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.059
Exactly.

05:09.685 --> 05:13.105
Because the more I get guests to pay,

05:14.815 --> 05:16.483
the bigger the tip I get.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.319
Everyone wins.

05:20.571 --> 05:25.242
Well, not the guests. They lose. A lot.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.121
Anyway, it's called upselling.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.000
And once Don Pablo
explained upselling to me,

05:33.083 --> 05:37.880
I realized that
that was my ticket to more riches.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.350
You've got some great options.

05:50.434 --> 05:54.521
The fajitas are fantastic
and our club sandwich is pretty good.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.565
But now, picture this:

05:56.648 --> 05:58.901
The two of you staring at the ocean,

05:58.984 --> 06:02.487
eating a tower of shellfish
plucked from the sea just moments before.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.865
You're not just ordering
the seafood tower,

06:04.948 --> 06:08.327
you're ordering the ocean itself.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.830
You hear that?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.582
The club sandwich is pretty good.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.212
I'll stick with that and, um,
maybe a side of calamari.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.296
You got it.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.381
I'm gonna go for a dip.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.050
Excuse me.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.179
Anything else for you, sir?

06:27.262 --> 06:30.307
Oh! Oh, no, I can't eat.
I'm-- I'm too nervous.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.808
My stomach's in knots.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.644
Why?

06:36.563 --> 06:40.526
It's our last night here
and later this evening, I'm proposing.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.111
That's fantastic. Congratulations.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.446
Thanks.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.825
May I ask what you have in mind?

06:48.909 --> 06:52.454
I thought I would wait until sunset,
then ask her on the beach.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.544
I'm sure that will be… just fine.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.007
Hold on. Wait a second.

07:09.721 --> 07:10.973
Is anything wrong with that?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.766
Oh, not at all.

07:12.850 --> 07:16.270
Of course,
it's no triple-platinum proposal package.

07:16.854 --> 07:17.938
That's okay.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.774
Some people don't think
these things are a big deal.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.110
No! No, no, no. This-- This is a big deal.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.320
What's in the triple-platinum package?

07:26.697 --> 07:28.657
What do you think is in it?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.701
-Music?
-Music. Of course.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.494
-Okay. And champagne?
-Champagne!

07:32.578 --> 07:33.954
Champagne flowing everywhere.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.039
-And maybe a bunch of flowers.
-Fireworks!

07:36.623 --> 07:39.251
Fireworks? That's amazing.
I was about to say flowers.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.045
How much is this gonna be?

07:47.885 --> 07:50.179
-One…
-One thousand?

07:50.888 --> 07:53.599
Yes, $1,000.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.976
But I must warn you,

07:56.059 --> 07:59.271
it's only for that very special woman.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.815
No one is more special than Kathy.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.234
We met in kindergarten
when she pushed me off the tire swing.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.319
Four stitches.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.321
That's when I knew she was the one.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.906
Here, I'll show ya.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.367
This was us at our senior prom.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.036
The theme was "beneath the stars."

08:14.119 --> 08:16.914
We danced to "Wonderful Tonight."
That's our song.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.294
Okay, you've convinced me.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.589
I'll get you an invoice and arrange
that package for you for tonight.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.007
That's amazing!

08:27.090 --> 08:30.052
I'm-- I am so glad I found you!

08:30.135 --> 08:32.804
You didn't find me. You created me.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.847
-Huh?
-See you soon.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.558
Operation upsell was in full effect.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.852
I was already counting the money
in my head.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.356
Those people are nuts.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.149
I see perfectly fine.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.400
Mom, I'm watching TV.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.363
Hey, Mom.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.157
Know what else is super dirty?

08:52.908 --> 08:53.909
My room.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.954
Yeah, I saw. I already cleaned it.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.459
You have the day off.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.964
Wouldn't you rather not clean?
You never do anything fun.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.633
Cleaning is a blast.

09:10.926 --> 09:14.555
Seriously. When I was your age,
I begged my mom to let me mop the floors.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.850
What? For all you know, it's true.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.727
Let's get out of the house.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.855
I wanna show you a cool place.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.909
Why did you bring me here?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.745
You want me to go deaf too?

09:39.496 --> 09:40.539
Hold on.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.208
How do you know any of that happened?
You weren't even there.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.752
Ninety percent of this stuff
I heard about later.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.963
Ten percent is poetic license.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.884
Anyway, I was very excited
about my big upsell.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.927
Julia, you're not gonna believe this.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.555
I just sold that guy
our triple-platinum proposal package.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.807
Do we sell proposal packages?

09:58.891 --> 10:00.601
No. I made it up.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.770
So, who should I tell about this
so they can write up an invoice,

10:03.854 --> 10:06.523
organize it, do all the work,
and I can get my share of the money?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.984
If you sold something
that we don't actually offer,

10:09.484 --> 10:12.446
the person you need to see
to make it happen is you.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.198
Oh, no. Not that guy.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.533
He has no idea what he's doing.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.120
Máximo, I'm serious.
First of all, triple-platinum?

10:20.621 --> 10:22.623
What kind of dummy falls for
such a ridiculous name?

10:22.706 --> 10:26.084
Second, you're putting the reputation
of the whole resort on the line.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.920
Chad is in charge of the invoices.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.130
He's going to be furious
when you tell him what you sold.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.423
What'd you just sell?

10:31.507 --> 10:35.552
The triple-platinum proposal package.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.472
The triple-platinum proposal package?

10:38.555 --> 10:39.765
That sounds…

10:39.848 --> 10:40.933
awesome!

10:41.016 --> 10:42.976
Just make a list of what's in it,

10:43.060 --> 10:44.853
and I will get you an invoice.

10:44.937 --> 10:48.023
Hey, sweetie,
I have to cancel our lunch date

10:48.106 --> 10:50.651
'cause my mom needs me
to take her car shopping today.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.027
Why does she need you for that?

10:52.110 --> 10:54.321
Baby, I had to teach you
how to change a flat tire.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.698
I have to take Polaroids of her
while she's sitting in there

10:56.782 --> 10:58.534
to see which one she looks best in.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.328
All right. Gotta go.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.789
Um, find me later with that list
and I'll get you an invoice.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.917
Uh, and what--
what's your name again? Máxico?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.335
Máximo.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.003
Mexico is the country we're in.

11:10.879 --> 11:11.880
Totally.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.551
A list? What kind of list?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.177
I shouldn't be planning a proposal.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.345
How do I even start?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.389
I will help you. Just come with me.

11:20.889 --> 11:21.890
Totally.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.905
Why is this suite abandoned?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.200
-Is it haunted?
-No.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.912
It's just been under construction
for ages now.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.999
This resort doesn't have
as much money as you think.

11:50.085 --> 11:54.756
So, you can do the proposal
over there by the gazebo.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.509
Oh, what about that cliff
over by the gardens?

11:57.593 --> 11:59.219
It gets the most amazing sunsets.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.472
The cliff is perfect. Thank you.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.770
So is this where you go and hide
when you're supposed to be working?

12:08.854 --> 12:10.272
No. The thing is, in the lobby,

12:10.355 --> 12:12.691
I'm only allowed to have
this facial expression

12:12.774 --> 12:14.860
even if I want to punch
the guest in the throat.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.613
But instead of doing that,

12:18.447 --> 12:19.865
I just like to come up here

12:20.365 --> 12:23.118
and make little drawings in my notebook.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.788
I sketch different patterns and designs.

12:28.916 --> 12:33.295
I-- I always wanted to be in fashion.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.796
Can I see some of them?

12:35.422 --> 12:36.423
Really?

12:51.688 --> 12:52.689
Wow.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.859
These are amazing.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.197
You're really talented.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.199
Thanks.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.743
I wish I could spend more time on it, but…

13:05.244 --> 13:06.745
but it's just…

13:08.205 --> 13:09.414
…just a crazy dream.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.832
What's crazy about it?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.168
It's impossible, Máximo.

13:13.836 --> 13:18.131
When my family moved here from Medellín,

13:18.715 --> 13:20.467
I thought I'd get this job to save money

13:20.551 --> 13:22.928
and surround myself
with the latest fashions.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.972
But it's already been three years and…

13:26.390 --> 13:27.683
I'm still at the front desk.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.435
I don't know what to do anymore.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.562
Hey,

13:31.645 --> 13:33.230
when I was a boy,

13:33.313 --> 13:36.817
people told me working at Las Colinas
was a crazy dream,

13:37.901 --> 13:39.444
but look at me now.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.405
So…

13:42.990 --> 13:44.533
don't give up on your crazy dream.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.995
Especially when you're so talented.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.047
Okay, so we have… the location.

13:59.131 --> 14:03.093
I'll help you with the flowers, but you're
gonna need more staff to help you.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.095
I'll give you the roster
with everyone's names.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.140
Perfect. I'll ask Memo to help us too.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.017
What's he really good at?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.810
Seeing the bright side of everything.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.272
And, oh! He has an enchanting gaze.

14:20.819 --> 14:24.114
Mom, look. You're gonna
like this one. It's religious music.

14:24.198 --> 14:27.117
The album is called
Defenders of the Faith.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.289
"Judas"! He's the one who betrayed Jesus!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.917
No. Saint Judas.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.712
See? It says the word "priest" right here.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.797
Ah, okay.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.882
Nora?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.220
Emilio?

14:46.845 --> 14:48.430
I knew it was you.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.600
Wow! You look great.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.521
What brings you to my st-- my business?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.064
Oh, no reason. Just browsing.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.565
You like Judas Priest?

14:58.649 --> 14:59.691
Yes.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.527
She loves them. She's their biggest fan.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.654
Well, then, please, take that album!

15:03.737 --> 15:05.113
It's on the house.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.323
Thank you.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.784
It's wonderful to see you, Emilio.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.744
But we have to leave.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.579
Right now.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.290
Come back soon.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.585
-Thanks.
-And if you like thrash,

15:18.669 --> 15:20.128
I also recommend Megadeth.

15:26.969 --> 15:30.097
You came to the right person
for help with a wedding proposal.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.349
I was there
for my first sister's first proposal,

15:32.432 --> 15:35.936
for my second sister's first proposal,
for my first sister's second proposal.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.730
I wasn't there for
my third sister's first proposal,

15:38.814 --> 15:40.566
but the guy was so nervous he threw up.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.818
So, I'm kinda glad I missed that one.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.611
That's what I'm doing.

15:44.695 --> 15:45.863
-One…
-Hi.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.281
-But no.
-I'm helping a guest

15:47.364 --> 15:48.740
plan a sunset proposal

15:48.824 --> 15:51.618
and he would really love for you
to sing "Wonderful Tonight."

15:52.494 --> 15:54.204
We would be honored to perform.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.664
-Thank you so much.
-For…

15:55.747 --> 15:57.624
A cut of the tip.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.044
Of course.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.255
-Beto!
-Hey, what up?

16:03.338 --> 16:06.633
We need help spicing up
a marriage proposal for a guest.

16:06.717 --> 16:07.718
Any ideas?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.136
Yeah, sure.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.804
I could pretend to rob the lady,

16:10.888 --> 16:13.599
and the guy could make a big show
out of saving her from me.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.060
Or maybe you could provide some champagne?

16:17.144 --> 16:20.022
Of course. But it's gonna cost you though.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.901
So as the resort's special event planner,

16:23.984 --> 16:27.237
we knew we'd need your help
planning this special event.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.906
And yes, you'll get part of the tip.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.492
I did have a wedding cancel last week.
I won't get into why.

16:32.576 --> 16:35.329
I'll just say,
leave skydiving to the experts.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.668
Long story short,
they never used their fireworks torito.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.800
Fireworks. That's perfect.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.552
Is it dangerous?

16:50.636 --> 16:52.262
Compared to skydiving?

16:52.346 --> 16:53.347
Yes.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.226
Okay, I got the invoice from Chad.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.771
Now all I have to do is have
Jessie sign it, and then I make, what?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.731
Ten percent? Twenty percent? Fifty?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.608
A pat on the back
and whatever tip he wants to give you.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.278
I can work with that.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.280
Have you seen Jessie?

17:10.364 --> 17:13.784
I think he was by the phone a minute ago,
but we can go check.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.244
So how you been enjoying Jane Eyre?

17:17.037 --> 17:20.540
Oh, it's great.
I-- I love Jane and all her Eyre'ing.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.669
-Just delightful.
-You haven't started yet, have you?

17:24.169 --> 17:25.963
There's just so many pages.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.297
Oh, there he is.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.132
But, Dad,
this is very important to me.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.510
Kathy deserves
the greatest proposal possible.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.972
Well, yeah, it might not be
responsible to you, but still.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.056
Wait.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.476
-What was he talking on again?
-A pay phone.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.396
It's like a smartphone

17:42.479 --> 17:44.857
that's glued to the wall
that you put coins in.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.068
Anyway…

17:48.151 --> 17:50.404
I don't know. I will work extra shifts.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.781
I promise you,
I will figure out a way to pay you back.

17:52.865 --> 17:56.159
-I don't think Jessie has any money.
-Of course he has money.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.744
I know I don't have any money.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.789
Then how can he afford to stay here?

18:00.873 --> 18:04.126
Yes, we were very lucky
to win that church raffle.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.503
How is he answering
all our questions like that?

18:06.587 --> 18:08.213
I don't know. It's weird.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.133
Okay, Jessie's broke.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.551
But my family is also broke.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.844
And we are for sure broker.

18:14.344 --> 18:17.264
Besides, I put a lot of work
into this and he agreed to it.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.348
Máximo, he didn't even know

18:18.432 --> 18:20.142
he needed all of that
until you told him he did.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.227
I can't help it that I'm so persuasive.

18:22.311 --> 18:23.312
Hey, Máximo.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.856
Um, do you have that invoice
for me to sign?

18:27.900 --> 18:30.152
My family desperately needed the money.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.029
But knowing Jessie was poor like me,

18:32.112 --> 18:34.573
it just didn't feel right.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.491
I'm very sorry,

18:36.575 --> 18:39.161
but we aren't going to
be able to provide you with

18:39.244 --> 18:41.872
the triple-platinum package

18:42.414 --> 18:44.583
on such short notice after all.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.377
Oh, well… Well, shoot.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.464
Well, then I guess
I'll have to go back to plan A

18:50.547 --> 18:51.632
and do it on the beach, huh?

18:53.926 --> 18:56.970
I just hope Kathy's not disappointed
that it isn't more special.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.641
I appreciate everything, Máximo.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.568
Don't you feel better now
that you did the right thing?

19:12.736 --> 19:13.862
You know what?

19:14.655 --> 19:15.697
Nope.

19:15.781 --> 19:18.450
I feel worse. Much, much worse.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.499
Tell me now,
who was the record shop guy?

19:25.582 --> 19:26.959
Emilio.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.128
We went out ages ago.

19:30.754 --> 19:31.839
He was your boyfriend?

19:33.090 --> 19:35.801
But he's cool.
He owns a record shop, and you…

19:37.094 --> 19:38.345
clean for fun.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.389
Excuse me, but for your information,

19:40.472 --> 19:42.975
he's the only other man
besides your father who I've kissed, okay?

19:43.559 --> 19:44.601
I was young once too.

19:44.685 --> 19:46.103
Don't believe you there either.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.607
Look, photos from my quinceañera.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.819
He actually was your boyfriend.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.239
And my escort to the party.
He was so handsome.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.366
He went on to marry a gal from Taxco.

19:59.449 --> 20:04.454
Aw, my best friend, Elena.
We used to go out dancing all night.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.583
Dancing? Night?

20:09.668 --> 20:11.420
-Hey.
-Máximo,

20:11.503 --> 20:15.257
did you know Mom was
a man-eating troublemaker in her day?

20:15.340 --> 20:17.217
Shh, stop it.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.343
What's wrong, son?

20:18.427 --> 20:20.846
-I had a really hard day.
-Oh, no.

20:20.929 --> 20:21.889
Wow!

20:22.389 --> 20:24.808
Look at the size of that cake.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.644
Wow. Look at the size of that cake.

20:27.728 --> 20:30.355
Five tiers.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.192
And there's like 200 people there.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.736
-Yeah.
-How could Grandma's family afford that?

20:35.819 --> 20:37.279
Here's the thing.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.947
Back in Mexico,

20:39.031 --> 20:42.534
when we wanted to celebrate someone
for a quince años or a wedding,

20:43.160 --> 20:46.538
everyone would find a way to contribute.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.791
We basically invented crowdsourcing.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.296
This is Marco. He bought my bouquet.

20:54.838 --> 20:58.175
And this is Rosa, she bought my dress.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.052
As I listened to my mother

21:00.135 --> 21:03.263
talk about everyone coming together
to make this day of her life special,

21:03.347 --> 21:04.932
even though they couldn't afford much,

21:05.599 --> 21:07.309
I was suddenly inspired.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.564
I gotta go back to work.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.274
Ugh, I hate that hotel.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.819
But I will say
it's turning him into a hard worker.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.657
And so, even though Jessie
can't afford a big proposal,

21:21.740 --> 21:24.743
we can still all chip in
to help make it special.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.870
Not for money, but for love.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.789
So who's with me?

21:37.214 --> 21:39.967
I'll help. Maybe I could sing something.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.677
I was kicked out of the school choir,

21:41.760 --> 21:43.220
but only because I was chatty.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.806
And we still have the cliffs.
That's a romantic place to propose.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.183
No, after you told everyone
the proposal was off,

21:48.267 --> 21:50.686
Mónica booked a cliffside
aerobics session up there.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.272
Cliffside aerobics?
Ay, that sounds dangerous.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.982
That's why she collects money up front.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.692
So where can we do this quickly?

21:56.775 --> 22:00.279
We need someplace unique
and private and memorable.

22:00.863 --> 22:01.947
-The balcony.
-The laundry room.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.116
The balcony! Great idea.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.327
We have to get everything together
before sunset, so let's hurry!

22:08.620 --> 22:10.622
The laundry room can be romantic.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.460
It feels like an eternity
has gone by since then.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.424
I feel like an old lady now.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.594
Oh, no, you're still young.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.928
You have good eyesight.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.848
And hey, even without your glasses on,
you described those pictures perfectly.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.604
Well, honestly,

22:33.687 --> 22:35.147
I could barely see them.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.567
I can describe them
because I know them by heart.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.823
I'm losing my sight and it scares me.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.079
Know what?

22:51.830 --> 22:54.291
I just thought of something
we can see together. Come on.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.005
It's so beautiful.

23:02.341 --> 23:04.468
Sometimes you can be angelic, huh?

23:07.471 --> 23:11.725
How sweet you're saying that before
you listen to your new Judas Priest album.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.196
Watch your step.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.572
-Oh.
-Careful.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.327
Uh… Hi.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.007
What? Jessie, a tire swing?

23:44.091 --> 23:47.219
It's time to go home now

23:47.803 --> 23:50.889
And I've got an aching head

23:50.973 --> 23:54.101
I don't remember
the exact words that Jessie said.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.769
All I remember is that

23:55.853 --> 23:59.022
we helped give two sweet kids
the happy moment they deserved.

23:59.106 --> 24:03.986
I say my darling
You are wonderful tonight

24:04.069 --> 24:05.195
-Yes!
-Yes!

24:05.279 --> 24:07.990
Oh, my darling

24:08.073 --> 24:12.160
You are wonderful

24:12.244 --> 24:15.664
-Tonight
-Yes.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.541
Let's go celebrate.

24:24.882 --> 24:25.966
Thank you again, Máximo.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.468
I-- I can't believe you
put all this together.

24:28.552 --> 24:29.887
Even the tire swing.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.347
Yeah, where'd you get
a tire from so quickly, anyway?

24:33.182 --> 24:34.433
I know a guy.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.032
She said yes!

24:50.115 --> 24:52.409
He's yelling that
to everyone we see.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.120
You were totally right,
I shouldn't have been so nervous.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.080
-Thank you!
-Congratulations.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.165
Who's that?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.584
I met him at the bar.
He's a great listener.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.628
Good.

25:03.128 --> 25:05.422
Oh, look.
Now we're actually under the stars.

25:05.506 --> 25:08.425
Hey, yeah.
It's almost as pretty as the gym.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.720
-It definitely smells better.
-Yeah.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.764
Two glasses of champagne, please.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.724
Yeah, sure. What's the room number?

25:18.727 --> 25:20.020
Actually, I'll take care of it.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.982
Your least expensive, please.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.943
You know what, Máximo?

25:27.653 --> 25:28.654
It's on the house.

25:29.863 --> 25:30.864
Thank you, Beto.

25:32.658 --> 25:33.951
I like that kid.

25:34.451 --> 25:37.079
My mother was afraid
that the resort would change me.

25:37.162 --> 25:39.248
But maybe, just maybe…

25:40.707 --> 25:42.751
It would be the other way around.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.686
Well done, Mr. Rochester.

26:01.854 --> 26:03.438
It's a reference from Jane Eyre,

26:03.939 --> 26:06.233
the book you haven't started reading yet.

26:08.068 --> 26:10.195
I'm gonna go home tonight
and start reading it

26:10.696 --> 26:12.447
just so I can make sure
that's a compliment.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.119
Hey there, beauty queen.
You wanna come dance?

26:17.202 --> 26:18.370
Yes.

26:21.290 --> 26:22.916
Hey.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.385
That gringo can't dance, huh?

26:34.928 --> 26:36.054
Nope.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.390
Not one bit.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.737
Triple-platinum.
