(PHONES RINGING)

05:33.781 --> 05:34.678
How many?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.178
200 plus, sir, and building.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.078
Convoys?

05:37.080 --> 05:37.945
Eight.

05:37.947 --> 05:39.178
The nearest is Bread, off Dover.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.678
Nine colliers and a
destroyer escort, sir.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.879
What's the weather
in the channel?

05:42.881 --> 05:44.879
MET OFFICER: Reports
say it's clearing, sir.

05:44.881 --> 05:47.045
Cloud feet now at 8,000 feet.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.412
Who's at Manston?

05:48.414 --> 05:49.712
Three squadron, sir.

05:49.714 --> 05:50.812
Get them up.

05:50.814 --> 05:52.812
And 32 at Biggin Hill.

05:52.814 --> 05:55.145
Put 111 at Northolt on standby.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.412
Roger that.

05:56.414 --> 05:59.678
Two-four-nine and
six-zero-three squadrons.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.047
One-zero Angels to two-zero.

06:08.047 --> 06:09.712
Acknowledge, quick.

06:09.714 --> 06:11.211
Squadron six-zero-zero.

06:11.213 --> 06:16.078
Two-three Angels one-eight.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.547
Not even the Luftwaffe
would go up in this sludge.

06:25.013 --> 06:25.879
B-flight!

06:25.881 --> 06:26.680
Scramble!

07:25.714 --> 07:26.415
Just delivering this.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.111
From the Squadron Leader.

07:31.113 --> 07:32.944
It says, well done.

07:32.946 --> 07:34.946
For what, not dying?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.944
Not joining me?

07:42.946 --> 07:43.781
Officers only.

08:24.781 --> 08:26.978
I thought nylons
were forbidden.

08:26.980 --> 08:29.745
They are.

08:29.747 --> 08:30.714
You won't tell, will you?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.547
(MUSIC PLAYING)

08:49.114 --> 08:50.547
Shit day all around.

08:56.181 --> 08:59.678
We'll be lucky to see the
month out at this rate.

08:59.680 --> 09:00.878
I hate it.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.678
Placing markers on
that board, knowing...

09:03.680 --> 09:04.747
Some of us won't come back?

09:07.813 --> 09:09.811
Do you say a little prayer?

09:09.813 --> 09:11.279
Don't get too excited.

09:11.281 --> 09:13.813
You're worth putting nylons
on for and that's about it.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.081
(PIANO PLAYING OUT OF TUNE)

09:42.081 --> 09:45.014
(WHISTLES)

10:53.947 --> 10:55.146
We are not bombers, sir.

10:55.148 --> 10:56.879
We are fighter pilots.

10:56.881 --> 10:59.112
In Poland, we shot
down many Germans.

10:59.114 --> 11:02.945
This skill, our
experience, your RAF needs.

11:02.947 --> 11:07.912
Having said that,
Urbanowicz, there

11:07.914 --> 11:10.179
is the question of English.

11:10.181 --> 11:11.612
The language.

11:11.614 --> 11:14.744
Yes, I understand most of
you can barely speak a word.

11:14.746 --> 11:16.012
You understand wrong, sir.

11:16.014 --> 11:17.179
Many of...

11:17.181 --> 11:19.912
Urbanowicz, I do
admire your conviction.

11:19.914 --> 11:24.812
However, the first Polish crews
will be trained for bombers.

11:24.814 --> 11:25.614
Dismissed.

11:36.081 --> 11:38.446
They did rather better
against the Luftwaffe

11:38.448 --> 11:40.779
than we give them
credit for, sir,

11:40.781 --> 11:42.745
considering the antiques
they were flying.

11:42.747 --> 11:43.677
That's the point.

11:43.679 --> 11:45.711
We have radar, a
plotting system.

11:45.713 --> 11:47.246
Hugely sophisticated.

11:47.248 --> 11:51.912
Can we risk it in the hands of
a bunch of marauding bandits?

11:51.914 --> 11:55.146
Stash the Poles somewhere
they'll do the least harm.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.212
That's pretty much what
we've been doing, sir.

11:58.214 --> 11:59.614
And Urbanowicz?

12:02.914 --> 12:04.945
English is half decent.

12:04.947 --> 12:06.712
I like his spirit.

12:06.714 --> 12:08.712
Send him to training.

12:08.714 --> 12:11.979
Feed him into an undermanned
fighter squadron.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.446
See how he gets along.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.712
You got that, Urbanowicz?

12:34.714 --> 12:35.578
Yes.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.146
Angels one-eight, 1,800 meters.

12:37.148 --> 12:38.112
Thousand, Urbanowicz!

12:38.114 --> 12:39.745
18,000!

12:39.747 --> 12:40.945
And it's feet, not meters.

12:40.947 --> 12:43.745
We want to fly at
them, not under them.

12:43.747 --> 12:45.879
BLUE LEADER (ON RADIO):
Bandits sighted in this area.

12:45.881 --> 12:46.912
Keep an eye out, boys.

12:46.914 --> 12:47.981
Bandits, 1 o'clock.

12:50.781 --> 12:51.446
Here they come.

12:51.448 --> 12:52.081
Scatter!

HIGGINS (ON RADIO):

14:35.847 --> 14:39.845
KENT (ON RADIO):
Drinks are on you, sir.

14:39.847 --> 14:42.414
I had you at a
million paces up there.

14:42.416 --> 14:45.079
I know how huffy you Yanks
get when we don't let you win.

14:45.081 --> 14:45.779
Canadian, sir.

14:45.781 --> 14:48.745
As well you know.

14:48.747 --> 14:49.479
How was it?

14:49.481 --> 14:50.545
Rear view is not great.

14:50.547 --> 14:52.912
It's a tight squeeze
in the cockpit.

14:52.914 --> 14:54.712
But the fuel injections
mean you can bank

14:54.714 --> 14:55.879
her tighter without a stutter.

14:55.881 --> 14:56.779
I mean it.

14:56.781 --> 14:58.912
She's a hell of a fighter, sir.

14:58.914 --> 15:01.046
Though I reckon I'd get
outfoxed in a Hurri any day.

15:01.048 --> 15:02.179
That's just as well.

15:02.181 --> 15:03.545
Sir?

15:03.547 --> 15:06.380
Your request for a transfer
from testing to combat

15:06.382 --> 15:08.046
has been accepted.

15:08.048 --> 15:11.046
New outfit, 303,
flying out of Northolt.

15:11.048 --> 15:11.912
Fantastic.

15:11.914 --> 15:14.812
If you say so.

15:14.814 --> 15:18.112
It's with a bunch of
foreigners, Poles.

15:18.114 --> 15:20.046
Been whoring themselves
across Europe, flying

15:20.048 --> 15:22.012
with whoever will have them.

15:22.014 --> 15:25.812
But they'll be
brand new, my boy.

15:25.814 --> 15:27.547
Once you knock them into shape.

15:30.014 --> 15:31.845
Sense of humor, sir.

17:06.847 --> 17:09.079
I just resigned from
Czech Air Force.

17:09.082 --> 17:10.046
They go to bombers.

17:10.048 --> 17:11.413
Fuck the bombers!

17:11.415 --> 17:12.944
I'm a fighter pilot.

17:12.946 --> 17:15.378
In France, I downed 15 ME109s.

17:15.381 --> 17:16.845

17:16.847 --> 17:18.944
15, sure.

17:18.946 --> 17:20.744
I'm the best.

17:20.747 --> 17:23.678
You're lucky to have me
in your shitty squadron.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.979
And also, I understand Polish.

17:24.981 --> 17:27.148
So don't go calling me an
asshole behind my back.

17:45.115 --> 17:45.947
They're here, sir.

17:48.847 --> 17:49.712
What about ranks?

17:49.714 --> 17:52.080
Do they keep their Polish ones?

17:52.082 --> 17:54.379
Have the Air Ministry decide.

17:54.381 --> 17:55.981
Least of our
problems, I'd imagine.

18:04.982 --> 18:06.912
God, they're a mess.

18:06.914 --> 18:09.912
They have hauled their asses
halfway across Europe, sir.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.346
Even so.

18:11.348 --> 18:14.049
They're going nowhere near
my planes looking like that.

18:16.914 --> 18:18.080
I'll call my tailor's.

18:18.082 --> 18:19.879
I'll fix them up.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.745
That'll cost a fortune, sir.

18:21.747 --> 18:23.082
I'll pay for it
myself, if I have to.

18:27.747 --> 18:29.912
Right, you shower
of Polish scum.

18:29.914 --> 18:31.812
Pay attention!

18:31.814 --> 18:32.714
Go on, tell them!

18:38.215 --> 18:40.779
For some reason, the powers
that be have deemed you

18:40.781 --> 18:42.879
fit for purpose.

18:42.881 --> 18:47.147
Now it's my duty to teach you
your arses from your elbows!

18:47.149 --> 18:50.946
Things such as, there
is the sergeant's mess

18:50.948 --> 18:53.047
and that is an officer's mess.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.980
And you must go
to the right one!

18:54.982 --> 18:57.880
Once we decide which of you lot
deserve to be called officers,

18:57.882 --> 18:58.680
that is.

19:07.115 --> 19:08.846
Is that it?

No, that's the

an excellent flyer.

But we've only got
your word for that.

Fact is...

21:13.081 --> 21:14.214
Sorry, but it's important we...

No, the last line is
X-V-R-F. Can you explain?

Shitty Sergeant.

21:45.882 --> 21:48.112
Again.

21:48.114 --> 21:51.079
Most importantly, some of you
have only flown fixed wheel.

21:51.081 --> 21:51.946
These?

21:51.948 --> 21:52.980
These go up.

21:52.982 --> 21:53.880
You just have to
remember to bring

21:53.882 --> 21:54.948
it back down before you land.

22:01.815 --> 22:03.112
Is there a
problem, Lokuciewski?

22:03.114 --> 22:07.746
Sir, you teach us MPH not
KPH, gallons not liters,

22:07.748 --> 22:09.112

22:09.114 --> 22:11.548
But the one thing we all
already know how to do is fly!

Urbanowicz and many
others, they already fight.

22:17.782 --> 22:18.646
Why not us?

22:18.648 --> 22:19.780
Because they're up to scratch.

22:19.782 --> 22:20.913
You want to die in
your first mission

22:20.915 --> 22:23.012
because you can't
read a fuel gauge?

22:23.014 --> 22:24.446
Listen, our
country is destroyed.

are doing fucking nothing!

We fly in combat many years.

22:30.681 --> 22:31.546
We kill Germans.

22:31.548 --> 22:32.279
We know how fly this plane!

22:32.281 --> 22:34.780
Yeah, but you lost!

22:34.782 --> 22:35.946
You lost.

22:35.948 --> 22:40.079
Poland, France, you
lost, god damn it!

22:40.081 --> 22:42.379
You stay where
you are, airman.

22:42.381 --> 22:44.447
We speak English in
the Royal Air Force.

22:44.449 --> 22:45.046
Right.

22:45.048 --> 22:46.379
You can fly.

22:46.381 --> 22:47.546
I get that.

22:47.548 --> 22:49.079
But there's other
attributes as important,

22:49.081 --> 22:52.079
like unity, like discipline.

22:52.081 --> 22:54.780
Every bullet fired out of these
guns has to be considered,

22:54.782 --> 22:56.279
has to be the right choice.

22:56.281 --> 22:58.679
Every maneuver up there has
to be the best, the quickest.

22:58.681 --> 22:59.546
That way we win.

22:59.548 --> 23:01.715
That way we survive, gentlemen!

23:16.214 --> 23:16.979
Thanks.

23:16.981 --> 23:19.946
How's the other half?

23:19.948 --> 23:22.945
Settling in all right?

23:22.947 --> 23:24.713
It's a long way
from Winnipeg, sir.

23:24.715 --> 23:25.548
That's for sure.

23:31.449 --> 23:33.679
Problem?

23:33.681 --> 23:36.679
Sir, I... sir, I've
been thinking about

23:36.681 --> 23:37.681
putting in for a transfer.

23:43.449 --> 23:44.846
Why would you want to do that?

23:44.848 --> 23:46.279
Why not, sir?

23:46.281 --> 23:50.079
Poles hate me more than they
hate the goddamn Germans.

23:50.081 --> 23:53.012
Well, maybe not that much.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.813
The fact is, we are
due to start training

23:55.815 --> 23:57.414
flights as of tomorrow.

23:57.416 --> 23:59.679
Sir, these men
are irresponsible,

23:59.681 --> 24:00.880
arrogant, and ill-disciplined.

24:00.882 --> 24:03.414
Well, you're their
commanding officer.

24:03.416 --> 24:05.780
If they're ill-disciplined,
then I should be concerned

24:05.782 --> 24:06.914
about you rather than them.

24:15.416 --> 24:19.813
Look, Johnny, I know we've both
drawn the short straw here.

24:19.815 --> 24:22.012
But the shit hit
the fan weeks ago.

24:22.014 --> 24:23.846
Spitfires, Hurricanes
are getting

24:23.848 --> 24:26.146
destroyed as fast as new
ones are being delivered.

24:26.148 --> 24:29.679
The level of casualties,
you've seen the figures?

24:29.681 --> 24:31.046
Yeah.

24:31.048 --> 24:32.681
They're only the ones they're
prepared to make public.

24:37.148 --> 24:41.947
Certified daily losses,
the past week alone.

24:46.148 --> 24:47.347
So you see, Johnny.

24:47.349 --> 24:50.046
I can't let you transfer
anywhere till I have

24:50.048 --> 24:52.780
a fully operational squadron.

24:52.782 --> 24:56.679
Which means I am relying on you
to knock the Poles into shape,

24:56.681 --> 24:58.014
sooner rather than later.

25:11.748 --> 25:12.480
How was it?

25:12.482 --> 25:13.646
Brilliant machine.

25:13.648 --> 25:16.414
Better than anything
I've flown before.

25:16.416 --> 25:17.780
Definitely, yeah.

25:17.782 --> 25:18.813
Any problems?

25:18.815 --> 25:20.945
The same issues,
throttle working

25:20.947 --> 25:23.615
in reverse, constant
speed propellers.

25:27.681 --> 25:28.414
Fuck!

25:28.416 --> 25:30.679
The wheels aren't down!

25:30.681 --> 25:32.012
CONTROLLER 1 (ON
RADIO): Wheels down!

25:32.014 --> 25:32.914
Wheels down!

25:49.881 --> 25:52.414
You really think they're
going to trust us in combat now?

25:52.416 --> 25:53.447
It's not my fly.

25:53.449 --> 25:54.945
It's the fucking wheels!

25:54.947 --> 25:56.812
I forgot the fucking wheels!

25:56.814 --> 25:57.615
I'm flying good!

26:52.948 --> 26:56.047
Picked up by sea plane
and you just watched?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.812
The same pilot could be
back, attacking us tomorrow.

26:58.814 --> 27:01.147
You tell us don't kill
pilots in a parachute.

27:01.149 --> 27:03.080
Not sporting, old chap.

27:03.082 --> 27:06.946
But when they are rescued,
we do kill them, yes?

27:06.948 --> 27:09.679
The Germans have
sea rescue planes.

27:09.681 --> 27:10.946
We don't.

27:10.948 --> 27:14.013
And marker dye to help
identify the pilots.

27:14.015 --> 27:17.913
Even the life jackets go
poof, inflate themselves.

27:17.915 --> 27:20.712
All things we're looking into.

27:20.714 --> 27:23.080
Look, I realize the
uncertainty back home.

27:23.082 --> 27:24.546
It can't be easy.

27:24.548 --> 27:27.812
Maybe you'd be better off
elsewhere with your own kind.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.080
There's a Polish
squadron coming online

27:30.082 --> 27:33.812
soon, 303 out of
Northolt, comprising

27:33.814 --> 27:35.047
your fellow countrymen.

27:35.049 --> 27:36.779
How does that appeal?

27:36.781 --> 27:38.812
I'm here to serve, sir.

27:38.814 --> 27:41.180
Wherever.

27:41.182 --> 27:42.380
Sorry about that.

27:42.382 --> 27:46.047
Fine pilot, but a bit
of a loose cannon.

27:46.049 --> 27:47.712
He's right about
our sea rescue.

27:47.714 --> 27:49.013
It's a disgrace.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.047
That last 109 he downed,
he only fired 15 rounds.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.946
We're taking naive
young boys and sticking

27:53.948 --> 27:55.080
them in aeroplanes.

27:55.082 --> 27:56.678
We're filling cockpits, sir.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.745
That's all.

27:57.747 --> 27:59.946
What if they're
all as good as him?

27:59.948 --> 28:01.180
The Poles, I mean.

28:01.182 --> 28:03.948
Sir, what if they're all
as good as Urbanowicz?

28:07.815 --> 28:09.913
OK, listen up.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.213
Today's a training exercise.

28:11.215 --> 28:12.980
Protecting the Blenheim Bombers.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.380
Remember, we work as a team.

28:15.382 --> 28:17.047
And above all, you
obey my instructions.

28:17.049 --> 28:17.848
You got that?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.049
Frantisek, what's the phrase?

28:32.882 --> 28:34.946
Wheelies up, wheelies down.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.113
Good boy.

28:48.748 --> 28:49.480
No heroics.

28:49.482 --> 28:51.447
Is that understood?

28:51.449 --> 28:52.813
Is that understood?

28:52.815 --> 28:54.980

I can't hear you!

Anyone else who
breaks formation,

29:29.915 --> 29:32.780
I'll shoot you down myself!

Not any farther, son.

30:34.149 --> 30:35.713
I'm Polish pilot!

30:35.715 --> 30:36.813
I want souvenir.

30:36.815 --> 30:37.514
It's his.

30:37.516 --> 30:38.846
He shoot it down.

30:38.848 --> 30:39.713
Please!

30:39.715 --> 30:40.913
For mess well.

30:40.915 --> 30:41.813
Go on, then.

30:41.815 --> 30:42.615
Be quick.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.147
Yes!

31:58.149 --> 31:59.813
Training flights
are just that.

31:59.815 --> 32:01.679
If you go around
shooting up the enemy,

32:01.681 --> 32:03.880
you compromise the safety
of the entire squadron

32:03.882 --> 32:05.080
and the Blenheims.

32:05.082 --> 32:08.381
And from now on, no
more individual heroics.

32:08.383 --> 32:13.080
You will observe strict
R/T procedure at all times.

32:13.082 --> 32:14.813
One final thing.

32:14.815 --> 32:18.980
I have a message here
from Air Chief Marshal.

"Congratulations to 303

down to Paszkiewicz

Sir.

33:10.015 --> 33:12.715
Myself and all the men,
we want to thank you.

33:14.882 --> 33:15.681
It means a lot.

33:20.982 --> 33:22.946
Good work, Kent.

33:22.948 --> 33:24.980
Money well spent, sir.

33:24.982 --> 33:27.713
There's this guy in
260 keeps asking me out.

33:27.715 --> 33:29.013
And I really like him.

33:29.015 --> 33:29.980
Then go.

33:29.982 --> 33:31.447
Well, I want to.

33:31.449 --> 33:34.746
But then I think,
what if he's killed?

33:34.748 --> 33:37.813
See, that's why
I always say yes.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.946
Because they're
likely to die soon?

33:39.948 --> 33:41.913
Because maybe we all are.

33:41.915 --> 33:45.980
Every day, more of them
go up and fewer come back.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.913
We must be running
out of pilots.

33:47.915 --> 33:49.946
Good ones, anyway.

from all of us...

40:41.082 --> 40:42.213
happened in the pub.

41:19.082 --> 41:21.080
Thanks for the invite, boys!

41:21.082 --> 41:22.913
But we have to keep a lid on it.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.814
Anybody finds out,
we'll be on a charge.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.013
We'll hide you under the bed.

41:28.383 --> 41:29.880
Hey, get the
girls some drinks.

41:29.882 --> 41:30.880
What would you like?

41:30.882 --> 41:32.946
What have you got?

41:32.948 --> 41:34.814

is last resort, maybe.

What's the problem?

45:03.450 --> 45:05.679
It's the size and direction.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:24.082
ME109 and an
Heinkel over Dover.

01:08:24.085 --> 01:08:24.948
Dover?

01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:26.814
You weren't vectored there.

01:08:26.817 --> 01:08:28.948
Witnesses?

01:08:28.951 --> 01:08:29.715
You know by now.

01:08:29.716 --> 01:08:30.915
No witnesses, no kill.

01:08:30.917 --> 01:08:32.814
There is no witnesses,
because you fuck off

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.082
and leave me on my own again!

01:08:34.085 --> 01:08:34.848
Hey!

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:38.050
You two, knock it off!

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:39.314
Go smarten yourselves up.

01:08:39.317 --> 01:08:41.983
You've been invited to
a party in your honor.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.550
The Dorchester of all places.

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:46.617
Dismissed!

01:08:51.885 --> 01:08:53.617
New word, Kentowski.

01:09:14.051 --> 01:09:17.747
Received a wire from East
Grintstead, burns unit.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.015
Krol's stable,
but it's too early

01:09:19.018 --> 01:09:20.750
to assess the damage long term.

01:09:24.018 --> 01:09:25.680
Right then.

01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:27.550
Let's go party.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.816
Good luck with
your driving test.

01:09:42.818 --> 01:09:44.050
I don't have one.

01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:46.182
They're suspended for
the war, thank goodness.

01:09:46.184 --> 01:09:47.015
Lucky for you.

01:09:47.018 --> 01:09:47.617
Cheeky bugger.

01:09:50.384 --> 01:09:51.381
You coming in with us?

01:09:51.384 --> 01:09:52.648
It's your night.

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:55.783
Wouldn't want to gate
crash the glory boys.

01:09:55.785 --> 01:09:57.149
I'll be in the pub
around the corner.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.149
The Crown.

01:09:58.151 --> 01:09:58.951
URBANOWICZ: Zumbach!

01:10:16.683 --> 01:10:18.617
This is like in Warsaw
not so long time ago.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:25.382
You'll be back
there soon enough.

01:10:25.384 --> 01:10:26.648
Back to what?

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:29.449
The Germans, the Russians
gorge themselves.

01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:30.951
They leave us with
an unsavory carcass.

01:10:35.718 --> 01:10:36.617
Thank you.

01:10:41.684 --> 01:10:42.983
Vintage.

01:10:42.985 --> 01:10:45.682
Tattinger or Ruinart, probably.

01:10:45.684 --> 01:10:47.449
Tattinger, I believe, sir.

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:49.885

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:26.149
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:28.682
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:33.052
our hostess for this
evening, Mrs. Smythe-Bingham.

01:11:38.818 --> 01:11:40.816
Air Chief Marshall.

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:46.416
My lords, ladies and
gentlemen, and especially

01:11:46.418 --> 01:11:47.749
the Polish pilots.

01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.985
(APPLAUSE)

01:11:54.985 --> 01:11:59.016
As you know this evening is all
about showing our appreciation

01:11:59.018 --> 01:12:02.682
to these brave men who've
left their faraway land

01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:06.551
to come and fight for us
in the skies over England.

01:12:46.684 --> 01:12:51.916
Finally, it falls upon me
to present 303 squadron

01:12:51.918 --> 01:12:55.015
with a new mascot.

01:12:55.017 --> 01:12:56.918
(BARKING)

01:12:59.984 --> 01:13:01.517
His name is Cooper.

01:13:01.519 --> 01:13:05.949
And I trust he'll be as loyal
to you as you have been to us.

01:13:05.951 --> 01:13:08.551
(APPLAUSE)

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:14.117
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:13:20.818 --> 01:13:24.115
Here they are.

01:13:24.117 --> 01:13:25.785
Quite a party, gentlemen.

01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:33.916
Three weeks ago,
we were all mad men.

01:13:33.918 --> 01:13:40.751
Now, champagne, fine
food, and beautiful women.

01:13:43.684 --> 01:13:44.849
We have a dog.

01:13:44.851 --> 01:13:48.182
When we are dead,
what happens to the dog?

01:13:48.184 --> 01:13:48.950
You eat it.

01:13:53.419 --> 01:13:57.215
This event was conceived
with the best intentions.

01:13:57.217 --> 01:13:59.816
These people wanted to
show their gratitude.

01:13:59.818 --> 01:14:03.450
And the men do appreciate it.

01:14:03.452 --> 01:14:06.015
I'm sorry, sir.

01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:06.883
I apologize.

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:08.682
The men are dead on their feet.

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:09.816
No need.

01:14:09.818 --> 01:14:12.082
I understand.

01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:14.417
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:14:14.419 --> 01:14:15.684
Enjoy the rest of your night.

01:14:18.984 --> 01:14:23.082
Ludwik, Ziggy, Anton.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:25.115
You won't see them
drinking your champagne.

01:14:25.117 --> 01:14:28.749
And all of this, while your
own city is being bombed,

01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:30.682
your people out in the streets!

01:14:30.684 --> 01:14:33.948
Shut the fuck up.

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:41.383
They're butchering
us, shooting, hanging.

01:14:41.385 --> 01:14:42.684
All over Poland.

01:14:45.452 --> 01:14:46.785
People we love.

01:15:18.051 --> 01:15:19.082
Sorry, you're too late.

01:15:19.084 --> 01:15:22.816
We've already eaten.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.915
I need you to
take me somewhere.

01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:27.417
My driving's not so bad, then?

01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.584
I'm too drunk to notice.

01:16:09.018 --> 01:16:10.417
Wouldn't hang about, you two.

01:16:10.419 --> 01:16:11.684
More Jerry bombs forecast.

01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:24.915
You know what they say
about imminent danger?

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:27.052
It's the most
powerful aphrodisiac.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:43.083
I wasn't judging
you the other day.

01:16:43.085 --> 01:16:45.383
I took things for granted.

01:16:45.385 --> 01:16:47.815
It was wrong.

01:16:47.817 --> 01:16:49.016
Forget it.

01:16:49.018 --> 01:16:50.085
I overreacted.

01:16:56.784 --> 01:17:04.682
You know, before
all this madness,

01:17:04.684 --> 01:17:05.750
they'd have called me a tart.

01:17:08.185 --> 01:17:10.951
Now there's a war on,
I'm just a good sport.

01:17:13.684 --> 01:17:16.916
And when this is all
over, who's going to know

01:17:16.918 --> 01:17:20.150
about my summer of love?

01:17:20.152 --> 01:17:22.850
Not my bloody husband,
whoever he might be.

01:17:45.683 --> 01:17:47.818
Don't suppose you have
girls like me in Poland.

01:17:51.818 --> 01:17:56.951
Phyllis, I doubt there's
anyone quite like you anywhere.

01:18:04.452 --> 01:18:06.885
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:40.050
(MUMBLING) Look at me.

01:18:40.052 --> 01:18:42.183
I looked like a Rembrandt.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:45.949
Now, like a Picasso.

01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:49.783
Trust me, you're
always a Picasso.

01:18:49.785 --> 01:18:50.684
Don't make me laugh.

01:18:53.684 --> 01:18:58.183
They let me go out soon, I hope.

01:18:58.185 --> 01:18:59.684
I have to go back up there.

01:19:04.684 --> 01:19:07.116
How are my boys?

01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:09.383
Are they still going good?

01:19:09.385 --> 01:19:11.383
They're remarkable men, Krol.

01:19:11.385 --> 01:19:13.050
You should be proud of them.

01:19:13.052 --> 01:19:16.216
I know I am.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.417
I am.

01:19:18.419 --> 01:19:20.551
It is an honor and a
privilege to fly with them.

01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:39.684
The Kosciuszko Squadron.

01:19:43.985 --> 01:19:45.951
You are one of us now.

01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:03.684

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.651
Come on, come on, come on!

01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:46.983
I'll take another back up.

01:20:46.985 --> 01:20:47.785
Get it ready.

01:20:52.052 --> 01:20:52.916
Hey.

01:20:52.918 --> 01:20:54.749
What are those?

01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.451
Benzedrine.

01:20:55.453 --> 01:20:57.150
You should try it.

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.716
They give it to us
instead of sleep now.

01:20:59.718 --> 01:21:02.116
I've asked them to get
you guys some leave, but...

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.083
There's a war on.

01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:04.883
I know.

01:21:04.885 --> 01:21:08.383
Anyway, what do
we do with leave?

01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:10.083
Two weeks now, no pay.

01:21:10.085 --> 01:21:11.549
Well, we've sorted that.

01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:13.949
Squadron Leader Kellet has
decided to pay all your wages

01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:16.949
himself for the time being.

01:21:16.951 --> 01:21:18.183
You see Krol?

01:21:18.185 --> 01:21:19.649
Yeah, I did.

01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:23.749
He'll live, but he won't be
back with us any time soon.

01:21:23.751 --> 01:21:25.384
Should outlive us all.

01:21:25.386 --> 01:21:26.582
Listen.

01:21:26.584 --> 01:21:28.883
There's something
I've got to show you.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:30.085
It's important.

01:21:43.684 --> 01:21:46.816
Emptying guns at
nothing and flying home.

01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:48.016
Who?

01:21:48.018 --> 01:21:50.682
Gabriel Horodyszcz.

01:21:50.684 --> 01:21:53.584
He's a danger to himself
and the whole squadron.

01:24:34.684 --> 01:24:35.119
Hello, handsome.

01:24:39.019 --> 01:24:41.851
ROLLO: You're confusing me
with the man I used to be.

01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:00.916
I do realize we've
been on for 26 hours...

01:25:00.918 --> 01:25:03.051
32, sir.

01:25:03.053 --> 01:25:04.682
The thing is, it's working.

01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:06.217
Their forward base is depleted.

01:25:06.219 --> 01:25:09.017
And if we sustain this level,
they won't be able to rebuild.

01:25:09.019 --> 01:25:11.816
We're knocking them down at a
rate of 2 to 1 for our losses.

01:25:11.818 --> 01:25:13.051
Last push, gentlemen.

01:25:13.053 --> 01:25:16.917
Win this and I'll tuck
you into bed myself.

01:25:16.919 --> 01:25:18.450

01:35:04.852 --> 01:35:06.917
have a great debt of gratitude.

01:35:06.919 --> 01:35:09.151
126 kills in six
weeks, gentlemen.

01:35:09.153 --> 01:35:10.917
303 is now officially
the highest

01:35:10.919 --> 01:35:12.850
scoring squadron in 11 group.

01:35:12.852 --> 01:35:15.750
That means in the entire RAF.

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.217
Gentlemen, your
contribution has been

01:35:17.219 --> 01:35:19.119
nothing short of miraculous.

01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:43.217
BBC ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER):
After six years

01:35:43.219 --> 01:35:45.451
of war in the streets,
millions gather

01:35:45.453 --> 01:35:47.817
to salute the Allied forces.

01:35:47.819 --> 01:35:49.750
Comrades from the
battlefront, wounded

01:35:49.752 --> 01:35:51.917
from every theater of war.

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:54.117
Representatives of millions
who fought and worked

01:35:54.119 --> 01:35:56.984
for that final victory.

01:35:56.986 --> 01:35:59.217
A two-mile long procession,
made up of units

01:35:59.219 --> 01:36:02.784
from every corner of the
globe, of every color, race,

01:36:02.786 --> 01:36:04.117
and creed.

01:36:04.119 --> 01:36:06.418
And now, the fly past
from our remarkable airmen

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:09.817
of the Royal Air Force,
headed up by three

01:36:09.819 --> 01:36:11.817
Hurricanes of 263 squadron.

01:36:11.819 --> 01:36:13.717
Heroes to a man.

01:36:13.719 --> 01:36:14.817
Fucking heroes.

01:36:14.819 --> 01:36:15.650
BBC ANNOUNCER
(VOICEOVER): There's

01:36:15.652 --> 01:36:16.652
jubilation in the streets.

01:36:28.086 --> 01:36:28.919
This is my family.

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.151
See?

01:36:34.153 --> 01:36:34.752
Baczewski.

01:36:37.952 --> 01:36:41.217
Once we make vodka.

01:36:41.219 --> 01:36:44.750
Now the Soviets take control.

01:36:44.752 --> 01:36:45.952
We have nothing.

01:36:51.986 --> 01:36:53.884
BBC ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER):
At the same time,

01:36:53.886 --> 01:36:57.017
from various assembly points,
an Allied marching column

01:36:57.019 --> 01:36:58.484
starts through the streets.

01:36:58.486 --> 01:37:03.217
Over 21,000 fighting men and
women of the Allied forces.

01:37:03.219 --> 01:37:05.217
All our gallant Allies...

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:07.950
Indian, Australian,
and Canadian.

01:37:07.952 --> 01:37:09.284
Gallant allies.

01:37:09.286 --> 01:37:10.817
BBC ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, a separate,

01:37:10.819 --> 01:37:12.217
mechanized column moves...

01:37:12.219 --> 01:37:14.917
Not all of them.

01:37:14.919 --> 01:37:17.019
Wouldn't want to offend
fucking Stalin, would we?

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.750
Thought you weren't allowed
to march in the victory parade.

01:37:25.752 --> 01:37:28.051
I'm meeting the others.

01:37:28.053 --> 01:37:31.950
And Kentowski.

01:37:31.952 --> 01:37:35.384
He wouldn't march without us.

01:37:35.386 --> 01:37:36.217
Loyalty.

01:37:36.219 --> 01:37:37.819
Rare commodity.

01:37:58.786 --> 01:38:00.153
I have three days
to leave the country.

01:38:03.952 --> 01:38:05.884
What do you mean?

01:38:05.886 --> 01:38:07.119
They're kicking me out.

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:16.117
After... after everything?

01:38:16.119 --> 01:38:17.719
They can do that?

01:38:23.086 --> 01:38:26.151
ZUMBACH: If you don't enroll
in the resettlement scheme,

01:38:26.153 --> 01:38:28.086
you've outstayed your
welcome, it seems.

01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:36.950
The English want us to
repatriate, but back to what?

01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:41.683
Some Selesian salt mine?

01:38:41.685 --> 01:38:44.784
Already men are
dying there, punished

01:38:44.786 --> 01:38:47.950
for what they did here.

01:38:47.952 --> 01:38:53.019
Poland may have won the
war, but we lost the peace.

01:39:06.053 --> 01:39:09.019
I'll never forget
you, Jan Zumbach.

01:39:12.786 --> 01:39:19.652
It's been precious,
every minute.

01:39:23.986 --> 01:39:24.886
Three years.

01:39:30.886 --> 01:39:34.850
I knew it couldn't last
forever, but today of all days,

01:39:34.852 --> 01:39:37.086
we're supposed to
be celebrating.

01:39:46.986 --> 01:39:53.418
I once said I doubt there's
anyone quite like you anywhere.

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.852
I was right.

01:40:01.386 --> 01:40:02.819
Where will you go?

01:40:05.819 --> 01:40:06.585
What will you do?

01:40:10.952 --> 01:40:15.118
France and the US.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.719
Africa, maybe.

01:40:19.086 --> 01:40:20.086
I'll find something.

01:40:22.919 --> 01:40:24.784
I would ask you to
come with me, but...

01:40:24.786 --> 01:40:26.917
I'd say yes.

01:40:26.919 --> 01:40:29.384
You wouldn't say yes.

01:40:29.386 --> 01:40:30.552
Not even if you wanted to.

01:40:33.154 --> 01:40:37.552
I've known from the start
you'd never leave Rollo.

01:40:44.952 --> 01:40:47.886
