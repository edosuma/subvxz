18:15.608 --> 18:18.356
So, forgive me, Woofy Dog.

18:18.821 --> 18:20.755
[ Sobbing ]

18:24.107 --> 18:26.427
Everything
just got so out of hand.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.896
I am not proud of it.

18:29.104 --> 18:30.536
[ Grunts, sobs ]

18:30.617 --> 18:32.488
I have never known my life
without you,

18:32.581 --> 18:35.948
and I don't even want to think
about what that would be like,

18:36.037 --> 18:37.951
and these last few days
when you said

18:38.020 --> 18:39.850
I wasn't your sister anymore,

18:40.134 --> 18:43.242
I honestly thought
I was going to die!

18:43.352 --> 18:44.668
- [ Groans ]
- Okay! Fine!

18:44.753 --> 18:45.845
Stop! God!

18:46.314 --> 18:47.728
You're my sister again.

18:48.929 --> 18:50.495
Are you sure?

18:50.919 --> 18:53.648
Because there's some people
who use the word "Sister,"

18:53.743 --> 18:55.043
but it doesn't
really mean anything,

18:55.206 --> 18:56.487
and they just go off to college

18:56.570 --> 18:57.802
and they never
see each other again

18:57.874 --> 18:59.200
and they only call
when it's time to put

18:59.282 --> 19:01.416
their parents in a home
or exchange Christmas cards,

19:01.489 --> 19:02.900
and that's it.

19:03.005 --> 19:04.853
But that's not
the kind of sister I want to be.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.570
I want to be the kind of sister
you call all the time

19:07.675 --> 19:10.141
and we laugh about
how crazy mom's being.

19:10.225 --> 19:11.187
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

19:11.293 --> 19:12.595
And your kids
look a little like me

19:12.690 --> 19:14.006
and my kids look
a little like you

19:14.103 --> 19:16.228
and we all go to King's Island
every year together

19:16.322 --> 19:18.242
and wear
matching t-shirts.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.373
I'll agree to everything,
except the t-shirts.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.660
No matching shirts.
You got it.

19:26.105 --> 19:26.981
[ Chuckles ]

19:27.908 --> 19:28.524
[ Clears throat ]

19:28.599 --> 19:31.265
Here, let's, uh...
try to fix this thing.

19:31.362 --> 19:33.710
I think I still might have
some glue left over

19:33.803 --> 19:35.585
from your toothbrush.
[ Chuckles ]

19:35.695 --> 19:37.060
[ Sobs ]

19:39.300 --> 19:40.546
[ Chuckling ] Okay.

19:40.699 --> 19:42.602
- [ Coughs ] Mm-hmm.
- [ Mumbling ]

19:43.674 --> 19:45.157
Okay.
[ Chuckles ]

19:46.303 --> 19:47.580
Hey, Dr. Goodwin.

19:47.673 --> 19:49.999
I found something
I think you might like.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.157
Oh, my stars!

19:53.239 --> 19:56.326
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

19:56.422 --> 19:57.676
Oh, my goodness!

19:57.763 --> 20:01.137
I heard about this family
who found a lost dog,

20:01.298 --> 20:03.285
and they treated him very well

20:03.376 --> 20:05.398
and he loved them so much.

20:05.641 --> 20:06.955
They called him Colin Firth

20:07.070 --> 20:09.090
after the handsome
and emotionally vulnerable

20:09.193 --> 20:11.149
British actor.
[ Chuckles ]

20:11.287 --> 20:13.908
So, this should make you
feel good, huh?

20:14.072 --> 20:16.262
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, are you kidding?

20:16.375 --> 20:20.239
He's amazing.
Yes, you are. Just amazing.

20:20.433 --> 20:22.692
[ Voice breaking ]
He really is.

20:22.791 --> 20:25.082
[ Chuckles ] And he looks
so much like Toffee.

20:26.162 --> 20:27.502
Excuse me?

20:27.611 --> 20:29.712
Oh, well,
Toffee only had three legs.

20:29.825 --> 20:31.541
But other than that,
they're twins.

20:31.699 --> 20:33.058
Wait, what?

20:33.223 --> 20:35.510
Are you kidding me?
This isn't Toffee?

20:35.599 --> 20:36.569
Oh, no, ma'am.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.979
But I can already tell
this little guy's gonna fill

20:39.063 --> 20:41.805
the giant gaping hole
in my heart.

20:41.901 --> 20:44.743
[ Chuckles ] Well, you know,
having a dog with four legs

20:44.845 --> 20:46.576
could be quite an adjustment.

20:46.706 --> 20:48.511
I'd certainly be
willing to help out.

20:48.609 --> 20:51.016
Hey, you know,
there's a great dog park nearby.

20:51.115 --> 20:53.607
We could all go after work.
It could be fun.

20:53.758 --> 20:55.753
[ Chuckling ]
No, thanks.

20:57.095 --> 20:59.197
<i>Some things</i>
<i>are hard to let go of.</i>

21:00.590 --> 21:02.408
<i>Some things are easy.</i>

21:02.495 --> 21:04.202
Sorry, Margie.
Just not my cup of tea.

21:04.307 --> 21:06.351
I don't think
I'm the target audience.

21:06.485 --> 21:07.418
Really looking forward to

21:07.516 --> 21:09.589
"Secrets Of The Ya-Ya
Sisterhood," though.

21:09.696 --> 21:11.624
[Whispers]
Ya-Ya.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.552
<i>And some things,</i>
<i>you never should.</i>

21:14.647 --> 21:16.346
So, I'll, uh,
text you some dates

21:16.447 --> 21:17.800
when you could maybe
come to visit,

21:17.880 --> 21:19.852
you know, like, uh,
when no one else is around.

21:19.932 --> 21:20.547
[ Chuckles ]

21:20.632 --> 21:24.155
Oh!
I have a brother again!

21:24.593 --> 21:25.380
[ Chuckles ]

21:26.355 --> 21:27.668
I really don't know
why you love me so much.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.218
I've done nothing
to deserve it.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.379
[ Grunts ]
Yeah, okay.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.072
You can let go now.
