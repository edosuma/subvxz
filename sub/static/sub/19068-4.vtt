WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.069
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:05.437
Daniel!

00:07.675 --> 00:08.707
Grayson.

00:08.709 --> 00:12.444
I give to you wireless power.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.581
Experiencing some technical
difficulties, sir.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.083
- I'd swear.
- We've met?

00:18.085 --> 00:21.153
Yes, I was thinking
the same thing.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.756
How long must I spend
skulking in the shadows?

00:23.758 --> 00:25.557
I wanna walk in the sun
like any other man.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.327
Sir, the sun.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.428
Damn.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.531
Be my husband,
and I will be your wife.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.666
What are you thinking about?

00:34.668 --> 00:37.836
I was thinking
about Lady Jayne Wetherby

00:37.838 --> 00:39.304
And her vampire hunting, of course.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.573
Now that the seers are dead,

00:41.575 --> 00:44.743
he will much more easily attract
others of his kind.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.845
Soon, London will be crawling
with the vermin.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.482
Lady Jayne is a huntsman.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.217
Seems the Ordo Draco

02:32.219 --> 02:34.920
is more forward-thinking
than I gave it credit for.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.955
Strange times.

02:36.957 --> 02:40.559
Wonderfully strange.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.728
You'll kill her.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.329
If I kill her,

02:44.331 --> 02:47.466
the Order will just send
somebody else to replace her.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.235
You'll end it with her.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.603
Now why would I do that?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.239
She's a vampire hunter.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.842
Renfield, not only will I evade

02:56.844 --> 02:59.845
her slightest suspicion,

02:59.847 --> 03:00.879
I'll take from her a prize

03:00.881 --> 03:03.982
she's given no other man.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.417
Her love.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.386
No.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.656
Something far more precious...

03:10.658 --> 03:11.890
Her trust.

03:14.994 --> 03:17.563
Make a reservation tomorrow night,

03:17.565 --> 03:21.233
8:00, for two at the Savoy.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.839
The most exclusive, visible
table in the main dining room.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.840
Yes, sir.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.595
Hello, master.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.304
Given the extent
of the putrefaction,

03:59.306 --> 04:00.906
I say the female is the youngest,

04:00.908 --> 04:04.243
five years sired, maybe less.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.310
This one, on the other hand,

04:05.312 --> 04:06.912
is clearly much older,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.714
a century undead at least.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.749
I mean, that said,
neither of the vampires

04:10.751 --> 04:12.918
are old enough to be the ones
that killed our seers.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.920
But the one who eluded you?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.755
There, sire, I suspect,

04:16.757 --> 04:18.257
which would make him older still.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.358
Old enough to be the one
we're searching for?

04:20.361 --> 04:23.528
Oh, he will be
a formidable opponent.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.696
Too formidable?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.698
If so, Mr. Browning, then god help you,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.400
because if I can't kill the beast,

04:28.402 --> 04:32.571
no one can.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.507
Josef Cervenka.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.876
My right hand.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.911
Maybe.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.480
A long time ago.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.749
Nonsense.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.652
You are once more
under my battlements.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.720
I summoned you here for a reason,

04:48.722 --> 04:51.089
and very soon,

04:51.091 --> 04:52.924
we shall destroy our greatest enemy.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.926
The Ordo Draco?

04:54.928 --> 04:57.596
The same.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.564
Rich men who've bet
their future on oil,

04:59.566 --> 05:01.066
but I've discovered a technology

05:01.068 --> 05:02.067
that will destroy them.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.102
But they are stronger than ever.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.504
Precisely.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.372
Just this night,
I saw two of my brood

05:07.374 --> 05:10.042
slaughtered by a huntsman,

05:10.044 --> 05:12.844
a female of all things.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.415
That's why I need your help.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.351
I know her.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.820
Then we will peel the flesh
from her bones.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.622
Not yet.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.425
We cannot defeat them
by killing them one by one.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.493
We must attack the source
of their power:

05:28.495 --> 05:30.062
their wealth.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.930
To pick their pockets
like a common thief?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.498
There's no honor in that.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.001
I'm sorry, sir. I heard voices.

05:36.003 --> 05:40.906
Renfield, this is my old friend
Josef Cervenka.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.808
He will be staying in this house

05:42.810 --> 05:45.610
as long as he wishes.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.184
Such a shock.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.455
As a boy, Daniel was diagnosed

06:30.457 --> 06:33.492
with an irregular heartbeat.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.793
I supposed it was just
a matter of time

06:34.795 --> 06:36.595
before it gave out.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.563
Still, he was so young

06:38.565 --> 06:42.134
to die of a heart attack.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.468
Maybe I should just thank the lord

06:43.470 --> 06:44.669
for the time we did have together.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.738
Mm.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.521
We shall drape the walls
and the ceiling

07:02.523 --> 07:05.157
with garlands of peonies
and apple blossoms.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.058
What do you think, Harker?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.494
Oh, whatever pleases Mina.

07:09.496 --> 07:13.098
I want this engagement party
to be perfect for her.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.666
Thank you, Mr. Grayson.
Are you quite sure...

07:14.668 --> 07:16.101
Of course.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.471
It'll be honor to host
your engagement party.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.906
And candelabras.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.240
Silver candelabras everywhere,

07:22.242 --> 07:25.510
on the tables and in all
the floral arrangements.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.512
Candelabras it will be.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.014
Mina?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.949
Mina, darling, come here.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.585
I want to show you how you're
going to make your entrance.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.654
One moment.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.624
I want you to tell me what you think

07:39.626 --> 07:40.926
About general Arthur Ogilvy.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.194
So we'll make your entrance...

07:42.196 --> 07:43.895
It seems he's
the military's leading advocate

07:43.897 --> 07:46.598
for war against the Ottoman Empire.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.233
Well, appearances can be deceiving.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.168
Explain.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.637
In private, he opposes the war.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.506
The real advocate is his number two,

07:54.508 --> 07:56.475
General Colin Shaw,
the war hero.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.677
Very popular in the public sphere.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.513
Hmm, and yet this war hero is willing

08:01.515 --> 08:02.848
to spill an ocean of blood to control

08:02.850 --> 08:05.517
the region's vast oil reserves.

08:05.519 --> 08:09.154
But general Shaw believes
the Ottomans are a real threat.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.956
You're not suggesting
he's advocating war

08:10.958 --> 08:12.257
for personal financial gain.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.558
He's a puppet.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.993
Powerful men
have staked their fortunes

08:14.995 --> 08:16.027
on the presumption that the future

08:16.029 --> 08:18.697
will be fueled by oil.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.098
It seems they've not only
declared war

08:20.100 --> 08:24.002
on the Ottoman Empire,
but on Grayson energy.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.173
You and me and everything
we worked so hard for.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.941
Head up, Lucy.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.776
You don't walk down
the stairs, you glide.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.311
I want you to find out
everything you can

08:33.313 --> 08:35.313
About this General Shaw, Harker.

08:35.315 --> 08:39.717
His weaknesses. His failures.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.152
Unless, of course,
you'd like to stay here

08:41.154 --> 08:44.256
and discuss floral arrangements.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.728
Leave it with me.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.730
Mina.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.775
Make your entrance from down here.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.349
Fireworks, we must have
fireworks with our aperitifs.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.751
Lucy, do stop.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.920
You'll make Mr. Grayson
regret his hospitality.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.021
Nonsense.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.056
We're ready for another test run.

09:18.058 --> 09:22.160
Ladies, this is
my chief engineer, Mr. Kowalski.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.930
I'll be down in a minute.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.331
Is he referring
to the resonator machine?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.901
- Are you testing it now?
- Just routine.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.203
If you'd like to stay and watch,
you can.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.040
Oh, lord, Mina, must we?

09:35.042 --> 09:39.010
Miss Westenra.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.812
If you wish to leave,
I can easily arrange

09:40.814 --> 09:43.882
a second carriage
for Miss Murray.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.588
Enjoy, as always.

10:00.633 --> 10:04.869
I presume everything is
in order, Mr. Kowalski.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.038
Commence stage one.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.374
Stage one!

10:09.376 --> 10:10.709
Mark!

10:19.018 --> 10:21.286
Stage two! Mark!

10:34.867 --> 10:36.301
Temperature reading?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.435
Steady.

10:37.437 --> 10:41.806
Well inside specification.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.108
The night of the party,

10:43.110 --> 10:47.379
You could've fried an egg on this.

10:47.381 --> 10:50.682
Aah!

11:20.713 --> 11:22.414
- Is everyone okay?
- Are you unhurt?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.115
We're fine, we're fine.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.950
What happened?

11:25.952 --> 11:27.786
The cooling system
performed perfectly,

11:27.788 --> 11:31.690
illlustrating the weakest link
in the design:

11:31.692 --> 11:33.124
the metal used for the casing.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.893
Renfield.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.028
I'll initiate a survey of all
the british steel manufacturers

11:37.030 --> 11:39.164
that work with nickel-steel alloys.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.231
Thank you.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.466
I don't suppose nuts and bolts

11:41.468 --> 11:43.501
can measure up
to your stock in trade.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.236
Sorry?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.872
Why, flesh and blood, of course.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.074
There can be no higher calling

11:49.076 --> 11:51.309
than the practice of medicine.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.777
The ability to save lives

11:52.779 --> 11:56.748
makes all our efforts here
seem trivial.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.220
Thank you, Mr. Grayson.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.354
Resemblance?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.357
No. She <i>is</i> Ilona.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.027
My wife died four centuries ago.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.729
I know. I was there.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.197
Then she has been born again,

12:12.199 --> 12:14.265
and the fates
have returned her to you.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.367
Now, you listen to me, Josef.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.502
You must never again mention

12:17.504 --> 12:19.304
Mina Murray's resemblance
to my wife.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.106
Do you understand me?

12:21.108 --> 12:23.842
Never. To anyone.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.080
- Where are you going?
- Out.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.042
Perhaps a glass of champagne

12:58.044 --> 12:59.944
To kill the time?

12:59.946 --> 13:03.381
No, thank you.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.131
What a lovely surprise.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.599
I'd expect you to be at the florist

13:21.601 --> 13:24.836
up to your neck
in peonies and apple blossoms.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.012
- Is something wrong?
- No.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.886
Listen, um,

13:41.888 --> 13:43.288
I've been reconsidering the idea

13:43.290 --> 13:46.257
of having the engagement party
at Carfax.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.493
Why?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.830
- Well, I... I feel uncomfortable.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.264
It's a huge imposition,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.500
and, well, frankly,

13:55.502 --> 13:58.903
I don't understand Mr. Grayson's
motives for hosting it.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.473
I mean, you're just one
of his employees after all.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.508
Well, I'd like to think

14:03.510 --> 14:04.843
I'm a little more than just that.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.010
Yes, of course.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.215
I don't know why he's so interested in...

14:10.217 --> 14:11.516
In us?

14:11.518 --> 14:14.385
He's assumed
this very intense involvement

14:14.387 --> 14:18.223
in our relationship
as if he's a part of it somehow.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.225
Well, that's because,

14:20.227 --> 14:22.627
I suppose in a way, he is.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.433
When we split up,
it was Mr. Grayson

14:28.435 --> 14:30.001
who took me aside
and made me realize

14:30.003 --> 14:31.569
what a fool I was.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.571
He made me see you
and respect you

14:33.573 --> 14:39.510
not just a prospective wife and mother,

14:39.512 --> 14:42.080
but a woman with aspirations

14:42.082 --> 14:45.016
every bit as important as my own.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.618
He did that?

14:46.620 --> 14:49.020
Yes.

14:49.022 --> 14:52.557
I didn't wanna tell you.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.459
Look, I know you hate

14:54.461 --> 14:56.661
all of this bother
over arrangements...

14:56.663 --> 14:57.929
Very much so.

14:57.931 --> 15:01.332
So let Lucy handle them.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.001
She lives for it.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.905
All you have to do is turn up
on time for the party.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.306
And in the meantime?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.541
Bury yourself in work.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.610
You're right.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.680
Of course you're right.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.424
Once you have graded
those papers,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.593
you will find in university storage

15:28.595 --> 15:31.329
18 recently slaughtered lambs.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.964
Extract the hippocampus from each

15:32.966 --> 15:35.667
and prepare them for dissection

15:35.669 --> 15:38.336
by the neurology students.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.538
I shall be back
in a couple of hours.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.042
Try not to disappoint me.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.980
Is there something wrong?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.348
Actually, I'd hoped for something

15:50.350 --> 15:53.751
a little less prosaic.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.453
Now, now, Mina.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.588
We mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.992
Better to be the tortoise
than the hare, yes?

16:02.695 --> 16:06.664
Anything but the lamb, I suppose.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.770
What is this witchcraft?

16:12.772 --> 16:16.207
Science.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.642
If this works,

16:17.644 --> 16:20.611
then we shall walk in daylight.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.614
To walk in the sun?

16:23.616 --> 16:27.018
Can you imagine us, liege?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.987
Immortal,

16:28.989 --> 16:31.689
invincible by night and by day.

16:31.691 --> 16:35.727
Yes, yes, it is all
very thrilling, I'm sure.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.284
<i>Noroc.</i>

17:20.739 --> 17:23.374
I can feel the sun.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.343
I can feel its warmth.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.647
Master.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.849
No.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.252
Josef.

17:34.254 --> 17:38.423
No.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.457
Yes.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.259
Yes, it worked.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.860
You call this a success?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.629
Don't you see?

17:44.631 --> 17:48.566
But only in the tissue
surrounding the injection site.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.701
Without a functioning heart,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.137
The serum cannot be distributed
throughout your body.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.740
All we need now
is a dispersion agent.

17:55.742 --> 18:00.211
The problem is one of mechanics,
not chemistry.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.481
The heart is simply a pump,
nothing more.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.583
If we can make mine function,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.718
the problem is solved, correct?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.621
Yes.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.225
These cells are alive.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.793
So?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.329
Blood cells die within an hour
or so of extraction.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.698
This slide is dated 1887.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.733
That's nine years ago.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.902
And this is why you couldn't
meet me at the florist?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.404
That makes no sense.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.939
What I can't understand is
how you can maintain

20:07.941 --> 20:11.342
such a willful disinterest
in your own engagement party.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.743
What?

20:12.745 --> 20:15.546
Honestly, Mina, it's like
talking to a man sometimes,

20:15.548 --> 20:17.648
nose buried in whatever silly thing

20:17.650 --> 20:19.417
has captured his attention.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.985
Lucy, what's wrong?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.625
I hate this.

20:30.495 --> 20:34.732
Lucy, I... I don't understand.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.867
You wouldn't, would you?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.004
You're not the one
attending to every detail

20:40.006 --> 20:42.740
for an extravagant party

20:42.742 --> 20:44.242
to celebrate the end
of the only thing

20:44.244 --> 20:46.811
that's ever mattered to her.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.246
Lucy.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.514
It's true.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.584
Things will never be the same.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.654
We will always be friends.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.959
Oh, Mina, darling.

21:01.961 --> 21:06.564
You are so terribly clever,
yet so terribly stupid.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.300
No, you are to be married,

21:09.302 --> 21:12.270
and that is that.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.608
You understand?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.577
No.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.911
I don't.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.549
Hmm.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.084
Get your things.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.086
We'll go to the cafe.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.323
There's a million things
to talk about.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.432
I am sorry, sir, I am assured

21:41.434 --> 21:44.735
my lady will be down presently.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.937
I have all the time in the world.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.007
Sir.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.580
Mr. Grayson.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.916
How unexpected.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.553
I must apologize for my absence

22:02.555 --> 22:04.055
from dinner at the Savoy.

22:04.057 --> 22:07.491
It was as inexcusable
as it was unavoidable.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.461
Oh, please, I had forgotten
about it entirely.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.798
By requesting the pleasure
of your company this evening.

22:13.800 --> 22:18.669
About you Americans,
it is your relentless optimism.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.604
I promise you a spectacle

22:20.606 --> 22:24.842
that you will not soon forget.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.878
Come now, Mr. Grayson.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.514
Surely, a man of your affluence

22:30.516 --> 22:32.550
can find a dinner companion
for the evening.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.718
Certainly.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.453
It's just
that this particular diversion

22:35.455 --> 22:37.755
Is beyond the petty refinements
of other women.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.658
Only you possess the sensibilities

22:40.660 --> 22:42.159
to appreciate it fully.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.761
Your flattery is too obvious.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.629
Flattery is a dull blade

22:45.631 --> 22:49.600
that I would never employ
against one such as yourself.

22:51.037 --> 22:54.705
This diversion,

22:54.707 --> 22:56.640
If it displeases me, you will agree

22:56.642 --> 22:58.976
not to call on me ever again.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.612
- Yes.
- Really?

23:08.954 --> 23:11.822
Yeah!

23:11.824 --> 23:14.191
Aah!

24:34.974 --> 24:37.041
Elsa, from the kitchen.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.679
Oh, dear.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.114
I trust she has no close relatives.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.783
Like all our staff,
none close enough

24:45.785 --> 24:48.152
To note her absence,

24:48.154 --> 24:51.222
Though I will miss
her apple crumb cakes.

24:55.660 --> 25:00.030
Bloody Cervenka.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.899
I've interviewed three men
from Shaw's regiment,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.701
two political opponents
and an adjunct

25:03.703 --> 25:05.135
who was dishonorably discharged,

25:05.137 --> 25:07.137
and none had a bad word
to say.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.806
You sound disappointed.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.874
No, I'm not disappointed.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.642
It's just I don't understand

25:11.644 --> 25:13.277
why Grayson's so interested.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.879
I mean, frankly, I've admired Shaw

25:14.881 --> 25:18.282
since I was a boy.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.117
I actually chose him for a subject

25:20.119 --> 25:22.887
for a biography in school.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.523
Do you wanna know something
very, very odd?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.591
What?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.261
For all my recent digging,

25:30.263 --> 25:31.629
I've not been able to uncover

25:31.631 --> 25:33.998
one single fact
that I didn't include back then.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.533
Perhaps there is nothing more
to tell.

25:35.535 --> 25:38.602
- That's why.
- Perhaps.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.743
Tell me something, Szabo.

25:45.745 --> 25:49.146
Have you ever met a man
without any secrets?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.749
I've destroyed
over half a dozen Nosferatu

25:51.751 --> 25:54.952
and they are summoned
by their sire.

25:54.954 --> 25:58.289
Now, I... I share your concerns
about the American,

25:58.291 --> 26:00.925
but he is hardly the greatest
threat that we face.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.794
Agreed, but we must
not underestimate Grayson

26:03.796 --> 26:05.796
nor the power of his purse.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.865
Making inroads with his man Harker

26:07.867 --> 26:09.366
is a start, but nonetheless.

26:09.368 --> 26:13.637
Yes, I think Grayson
does bear scrutiny.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.840
I agree with Jayne.
The Order needn't be involved.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.612
I shall see to it personally.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.781
Good. Keep me informed.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.384
Ah, our distinguished guests
have arrived.

26:27.386 --> 26:31.121
Welcome, General Shaw,
General Ogilvy.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.356
My lady. My lord.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.726
Please, gentlemen, sit down.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.262
So, General,

26:38.264 --> 26:39.930
You assured us total control

26:39.932 --> 26:41.999
of the persian oil fields by March.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.668
Yes, of course,
but as you may know,

26:44.670 --> 26:47.605
the situation has become
much more complex.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.607
How so? Please explain.

26:49.609 --> 26:50.674
May I?

26:50.676 --> 26:52.142
Of course.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.111
Our provocateurs have been unable

26:54.113 --> 26:57.281
To foment so much
as a border skirmish

26:57.283 --> 26:59.950
since the sultan issued a decree
to his men

26:59.952 --> 27:02.820
to stand down under pain of death.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.989
So you see,
there's little we can do,

27:04.991 --> 27:08.659
save a full-scale
preemptive invasion.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.428
Of course,
parliament would never...

27:37.789 --> 27:41.025
My condolences, General Shaw.

27:41.027 --> 27:45.696
It appears General Ogilvy
hanged himself.

27:45.698 --> 27:46.997
His adjunct will discover him

27:46.999 --> 27:51.902
in the washroom of his quarters
tomorrow morning.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.004
Tragic.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.808
So, General, when can we expect

27:57.810 --> 28:01.478
to begin the Ottoman offensive?

28:01.480 --> 28:04.181
Shall we say August?

28:06.117 --> 28:08.318
Yes, sir.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.387
August.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.191
It is an interesting case,

28:14.193 --> 28:16.760
one which requires
your particular talents.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.996
What are your intentions?

28:18.998 --> 28:22.332
Discover the one thing
Mr. Alexander Grayson

28:22.334 --> 28:24.001
loves most in all the world.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.103
Mm-hmm.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.839
Corrupt it. Deface it.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.942
Obliterate it from this earth.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.912
Is the Order aware of your intention?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.947
They're aware that
I'm investigating Mr. Grayson.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.083
Please. Answer the question.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.150
Well, you know as well as I

28:40.152 --> 28:41.285
that if they did, I would be forced

28:41.287 --> 28:42.720
to explain my motivation.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.122
You mean your son's recent suicide

28:45.124 --> 28:47.491
after the death of his lover?

28:47.493 --> 28:51.061
I only wish to clarify the situation,

28:51.063 --> 28:53.197
and that is thus:

28:53.199 --> 28:55.733
you wish to employ my services

28:55.735 --> 29:00.504
in order to execute
an unsanctioned operation.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.841
As I said before,
not completely unsanctioned.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.546
I understand.

29:09.548 --> 29:12.549
May I then rely on your complete
discretion in this matter

29:12.551 --> 29:14.318
so that I may engage
another contractor?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.353
That will not be necessary.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.022
I have decided
to accept the assignment.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.125
Despite it being unsanctioned?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.526
Because it is unsanctioned,

29:22.528 --> 29:25.963
I will require double my standard fee.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.335
Plus expenses, of course.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.271
Of course.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.185
Mr. Harker?

30:13.846 --> 30:17.147
It seems her ladyship
wishes to see me tonight.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.515
No details.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.118
How intriguing.

30:25.056 --> 30:26.890
Sir, how long is Mr. Cervenka

30:26.892 --> 30:28.025
going to be our guest?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.194
You heard me.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.096
As long as he wishes.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.998
Do you have any objections?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.100
Oh, yes,

30:37.102 --> 30:39.136
Quite a growing number
of objections...

30:40.372 --> 30:42.973
Chief among which
is his lack of discretion

30:42.975 --> 30:45.008
and complete absence of self-control.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.080
You're right.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.282
He can be impetuous.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.151
But Josef has saved my life
on the battlefield

30:54.153 --> 30:56.553
more times than I care to count.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.222
He's like my brother,

30:58.224 --> 31:00.424
more than my brother.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.893
His loyalty is absolute,

31:02.895 --> 31:04.394
and he will obey my orders.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.363
Nevertheless, he has demonstrated

31:06.365 --> 31:08.665
that his obedience and loyalty fall

31:08.667 --> 31:12.569
a distant second and third
to his nature.

31:12.571 --> 31:16.540
He cannot be domesticated,
nor fully trusted.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.541
Why?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.443
He knows your true feelings

31:19.445 --> 31:22.145
toward Miss Murray, for one,

31:22.147 --> 31:23.914
and their origins.

31:23.916 --> 31:25.983
I've sworn his silence.

31:25.985 --> 31:30.053
A silence I'm sure
he means to keep,

31:30.055 --> 31:33.523
but only insofar
as he's capable of keeping it.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.593
It's not <i>his</i> loyalty that worries me.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.973
I'm glad you came.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.342
These things are best done in person.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.345
What things?

31:55.347 --> 31:57.414
Well, I did enjoy our soiree last night,

31:57.416 --> 31:58.682
and I do find your company,

31:58.684 --> 32:01.151
on occasion, most agreeable,

32:01.153 --> 32:04.121
but I'm afraid I must terminate
this relationship.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.023
How distressingly predictable.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.392
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.928
- I'll be on my way.
- No, wait.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.197
Exactly what is this predictability

32:14.199 --> 32:16.934
that you find so...
- distressing?

32:16.936 --> 32:19.069
Well, not so much distressing
as disappointing.

32:19.071 --> 32:24.508
The situation is clear,
crystal clear, in fact.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.444
- Must I go on?
- Please do.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.012
You're a woman
who takes great pleasure

32:29.014 --> 32:31.281
in asserting her domination
over men.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.350
However, once you do,

32:33.352 --> 32:35.352
you very soon grow bored
with them.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.220
True enough. Go on.

32:37.222 --> 32:40.223
Since we met,
you've made every effort

32:40.225 --> 32:41.959
to do the same with me,

32:41.961 --> 32:44.695
and in this,
you have utterly failed.

32:44.697 --> 32:45.729
Oh.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.297
This failure to dominate me

32:47.299 --> 32:50.434
has led to you being infatuated
with me.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.536
Such is the intensity
of your emotions

32:52.538 --> 32:54.037
that they threaten your sense

32:54.039 --> 32:56.173
of independence and control.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.375
The only way
to reassert this control

32:58.377 --> 32:59.977
is by terminating our relationship.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.145
Oh, you do flatter yourself so.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.782
Your vulnerability is evident
by your withdrawal.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.484
I call your actions cowardice.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.252
I call your ploys tedious.

33:09.254 --> 33:12.456
You still assert
that you feel nothing for me?

33:15.626 --> 33:17.494
Nothing at all.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.030
Follow me, sir.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.634
- This way, sir.
- Tonight's engagement?

33:24.636 --> 33:25.702
I imagine so.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.270
And does it give you
great pleasure

33:27.272 --> 33:29.039
to see me here as he arrives?

33:29.041 --> 33:31.775
The game, Mr. Grayson,
requires at least three players.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.511
Someday, madam,

33:34.513 --> 33:38.382
you'll realize
I was never playing.

33:47.225 --> 33:50.193
The huntress made a fool of you.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.361
You know nothing.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.064
I followed you.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.767
I heard every word.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.602
Who gave you permission
to follow me?

33:58.604 --> 34:00.504
I could smell her stink on you

34:00.506 --> 34:04.708
when you returned home last night.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.576
I could never have believed
you would consort

34:06.578 --> 34:10.313
with such a despicable creature.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.552
Do you not understand?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.822
We have a very complex strategy.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.389
Some of our tactics are distasteful.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.659
- Disgusting.
- Perhaps.

34:23.661 --> 34:28.565
But they are necessary
if we are to emerge victorious.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.101
We are playing a very dangerous

34:31.103 --> 34:33.870
and a very unforgiving game.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.406
By seducing their huntress,
I take her out of their game.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.476
Ah, but not anymore

34:39.478 --> 34:42.212
because there she is,

34:42.214 --> 34:45.248
back on the board,

34:45.250 --> 34:47.317
hunting us, killing us.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.186
Do you not remember
when we were the hunters

34:49.188 --> 34:51.855
and they were the prey?

34:51.857 --> 34:56.426
Would harvest a hundred souls
before breakfast.

35:03.234 --> 35:07.671
Please, my liege.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.774
I beseech thee. Let me kill her.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.317
Make her scream.

35:40.872 --> 35:44.141
Mr. Harker?

35:48.179 --> 35:49.412
You sent me the note?

35:49.414 --> 35:51.381
Peter Lang,

35:51.383 --> 35:55.552
formally Corporal Lang
of Her Majesty's Rifle Brigade.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.524
You have the truth I seek
regarding Shaw?

36:00.526 --> 36:04.461
I do. Cost you 10 bob to hear it.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.206
I've got an address for you

36:16.208 --> 36:18.241
and a name,

36:18.243 --> 36:21.278
a lady called Vera Markham.

36:26.784 --> 36:27.918
Who is she to him?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.220
See for yourself.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.680
Who is it?

36:56.682 --> 36:59.716
Uh, my name's Jonathan Harker.

37:02.486 --> 37:04.588
Yes?

37:04.590 --> 37:07.691
I'm looking for Vera Markham.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.559
I'm Vera Markham.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.495
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.330
Your heart... There was a man.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.765
No, no, he's gone,
he's gone, he's gone.

38:21.767 --> 38:25.935
He's gone.
You scared him away.

38:25.937 --> 38:30.440
Oh, god.
Oh, you saved my life.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.917
What were you doing in
my bedroom in the first place?

38:40.919 --> 38:45.989
I suffer from insomnia
from time to time,

38:45.991 --> 38:49.826
and it's my habit
to take long, nighttime walks.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.329
As of late, I find myself

38:52.331 --> 38:56.333
increasingly drawn to this street.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.627
The one we've been searching for?

39:24.629 --> 39:26.429
I believe so.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.739
So London is free again?

39:37.908 --> 39:39.075
Excellent.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.910
Thank you, sir.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.746
Your methods, though.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.681
It was reckless, foolhardy, even,

39:44.683 --> 39:46.483
To lure such a creature into your home.

39:46.485 --> 39:50.887
- But surely you must see...
- There was no chance.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.939
You would not have recognized her.

40:09.941 --> 40:14.944
So contrite, so gentle, so shy.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.980
I have sheared the tiger's claws.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.582
Just as you said you would, sir.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.185
Although some doubted me.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.188
She'll never see me now.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.758
The Ordo Draco has lost
its most dangerous weapon,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.560
and it doesn't even know it.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.930
And you were able to remove
Josef in the process.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.733
A masterstroke.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.636
Yes.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.872
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't mention it.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.941
Josef was a soldier.

40:44.943 --> 40:48.011
He would have understood.

40:55.486 --> 40:58.054
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice a knight

40:58.056 --> 41:01.124
to capture a queen.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.031
Good-bye, Josef.

41:16.574 --> 41:20.243
Tomorrow, we get back
to work, renfield.

41:20.245 --> 41:23.913
We need that alloy for the resonator.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.982
Yes, sir.

41:42.099 --> 41:45.835
Ma'am, may I help you with that?

41:47.571 --> 41:49.639
Wha...

41:54.845 --> 41:56.913
Police business.
He's a known criminal.

41:56.915 --> 42:00.750
No cause for alarm.

42:15.099 --> 42:18.167
Come on, let's get out of here.
