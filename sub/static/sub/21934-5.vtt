WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.404
(mellow piano music playing)

00:03.437 --> 00:05.439
(indistinct chatter)

00:12.813 --> 00:14.548
WALTER: Is my tie too short?
PAIGE: It's fine.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.649
What about my collar?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.385
(chuckles) I'll straighten
it for the hundredth time,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.053
if that calms you.

00:19.087 --> 00:22.223
Why are you so stressed
about some nerd gala?

00:22.256 --> 00:24.358
Vor is the Norse
goddess of wisdom,

00:24.392 --> 00:27.461
and the Vor Collective is
the top one percent

00:27.495 --> 00:29.197
of the top
one percent of minds.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.065
It's as if Mensa had
its own Mensa,

00:31.099 --> 00:32.100
and that's why
I need your help.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.467
My help? With what? Yeah.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.536
These people are
all geniuses,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.171
and you know how
to talk to my kind

00:37.205 --> 00:38.606
better than I do.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.709
So you will charm the
pants off the membership,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.145
and once they see
that I'm with someone

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
as incredible as you,

00:46.180 --> 00:47.648
they will realize that
they were wrong about me

00:47.681 --> 00:50.218
and let me back
into the club.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
Allowing you back in?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
Why are you... Why are you
telling me this now?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.588
And what did you do
to have a fallout?

00:54.622 --> 00:55.656
(scoffs):
Nothing.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.091
It's a small disagreement,

00:57.125 --> 00:59.193
easily rectified with
your social skills.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.195
So, uh, focus, you're on.

01:01.229 --> 01:04.232
Oh, boy.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.799
Sir, here you are.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.335
Thank you.
My pleasure.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.871
(Paige speaking indistinctly)

01:10.904 --> 01:12.240
(laughter)

01:13.507 --> 01:15.876
(forced chuckle)

01:15.909 --> 01:18.512
That's very...
Gentlemen.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.182
O'Brien, you got some nerve
showing your face here.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.650
Oh, Vadat.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.817
What a sense of humor.
Darling...

01:23.851 --> 01:25.719
Thank you. Cheers.
Your wine.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.156
Hold a moment.
She's with you?

01:28.189 --> 01:31.292
Yes. She is my
girlfriend.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.059
We've been intimate.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.296
(quietly):
Unnecessary detail.

01:35.329 --> 01:39.133
Ms. Dineen, you have been
a pleasure to talk to,

01:39.167 --> 01:41.835
but none of us are willing
to engage with this man.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.604
He's currently
on probation.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.174
Yes, he told me that
he and the group had

01:46.207 --> 01:47.841
some kind of small disagreement,

01:47.875 --> 01:50.244
but surely we can
bury the old hatchet.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.512
Disagreement?

01:51.545 --> 01:52.780
Is that what you told her?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.582
Nine members were hospitalized.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.285
Hospitalized?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.319
(whispering):
What did you do?

01:58.352 --> 01:59.119
He infected us with

01:59.153 --> 02:01.655
Shigatoxigenic serotype E. Coli.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.357
I was merely trying
to prove my theory

02:03.391 --> 02:04.858
that certain bacteria
could survive

02:04.892 --> 02:05.793
in an animated state that...

02:05.826 --> 02:08.296
You brought a pathogen
to a dinner party.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.630
So everybody could see.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.165
In ice cubes.
Oh, boy.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.433
In a crystal ice bucket.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.502
I had to bring them
in ice so that

02:14.535 --> 02:15.836
they could reach
suspended animation,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.838
and these parties
are fancy.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.308
Or would you have preferred
a Styrofoam chest?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.276
I would have preferred
not to contract what my doctor

02:22.310 --> 02:23.377
described in his report as--

02:23.411 --> 02:25.613
excuse my directness--

02:25.646 --> 02:28.148
"explosive diarrhea."

02:31.219 --> 02:34.455
I didn't think anyone would
actually digest the cubes.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.358
You could have stopped
after "I didn't think."

02:38.626 --> 02:41.195
Ms. Dineen, it has truly
been my pleasure

02:41.229 --> 02:43.664
to meet you.
Mr. O'Brien,

02:43.697 --> 02:46.200
until the board makes
a final determination

02:46.234 --> 02:48.702
as to your membership status,
I suggest you go.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.275
Well, that was...

02:54.308 --> 02:55.909
A total disaster?

02:55.943 --> 02:58.746
Aw, come on,
it can't be that bad.

02:58.779 --> 03:02.316
Your shocks are shot,
the brakes are worn through,

03:02.350 --> 03:03.784
leaks like a full diaper.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.486
Leaks what?
Oil,

03:05.519 --> 03:06.754
coolant, transmission fluid,

03:06.787 --> 03:08.222
brake fluid,
power-steering fluid.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.823
And I can't get
that Laura Branigan cassette

03:09.857 --> 03:11.692
out of the tape player

03:11.725 --> 03:14.262
without taking apart
the whole radio.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.264
Why did you buy this heap?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.232
'Cause in addition to taking
my passport, gun, and badge,

03:18.266 --> 03:21.235
Homeland also took back
my SUV two days ago.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.237
I know why
we're all poor.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.307
Elon Musk aside, most
geniuses suck with money.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.742
But you've had
a steady job for decades.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.844
Yeah, a steady government
law enforcement job.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.380
It's not exactly
the road to riches.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.948
I had $65K saved,
and I gave each of you

03:34.982 --> 03:37.251
$10K to start paying
you back for my bail.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.819
We told you not to do that,
dummy.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.721
Cabe Gallo doesn't owe.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.656
I'm down to my last 15 grand,

03:42.690 --> 03:43.957
and I bought
this car for 500,

03:43.991 --> 03:45.359
and now you're telling me
it's not worth...

03:45.393 --> 03:46.360
My time.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.861
Might not conk out on you
today or tomorrow,

03:47.895 --> 03:48.996
but it will soon.

03:49.029 --> 03:52.466
I can fix it, but parts alone
will run you thousands.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.304
Never took you
for a whitewalls guy.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.972
Yeah, well, I haven't
been myself lately.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.442
Took my gun and my tin.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.677
Now I got a badge
that says "intern."

04:03.711 --> 04:06.414
Now that you mention it,
I could use a coffee.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.682
That's very funny.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.519
But I'll get you a cup
because you helped with the car.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.620
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.787
No café con leche,
por favor.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.589
Happy, shame on you.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.358
Come on, I need to get
perked up.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.293
You need to get
knocked up,

04:19.327 --> 04:20.728
and coffee's a
violation of STORK.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.496
Oh, I don't want
to know about this.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.864
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.400
Happy and I have conceived
a conception plan.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.501
It's called STORK.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.670
"S" is for sexy time
only at moments

04:29.703 --> 04:30.471
of optimal fertility.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.740
I'm not interested
in your sexy time.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.808
I'm barely interested
in our sexy time.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.410
"T" is temperature.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.612
I'm gonna keep my gooty
at a cool 97 degrees

04:38.646 --> 04:41.315
to maximize efficacy
of my spermatozoon.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.883
So all boxers,
no briefs.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.486
I don't want coffee anymore.
I feel sick.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.621
"O" is for organic.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.057
Treat our bodies
like all-natural shrines.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.025
"R"... reduce stress.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.462
And "K,"
keep the tenets of STORK.

04:54.495 --> 04:58.399
Coffee is a stimulant that
increases blood pressure

04:58.432 --> 05:01.034
just like stress,
so that's a no-go.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.603
And I-I seriously doubt

05:02.636 --> 05:03.704
that the sludge
that Cabe's making

05:03.737 --> 05:04.705
is organic.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.407
It definitely is not.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.008
What's with you guys
and the acronyms?

05:08.041 --> 05:11.445
Now that you've told Cabe
how you plan to impregnate me,

05:11.479 --> 05:12.813
I'd like to leave.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.647
We need to get to that

05:13.681 --> 05:16.049
Tech-Splosion conference
now, anyway.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.351
Mm, yeah, we should
drum up some work

05:17.385 --> 05:19.086
to fill little
Tobina's college fund.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.488
Well, Walt and Paige said
they'd meet us there.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.056
I can give you guys a ride.
Plenty of room.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.825
No way am I getting
into that death trap.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.527
HAPPY: That thing is
on its last legs.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.062
Come on, husband.
I'm driving.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.431
All right,
suit yourself.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.501
But this old gal,
she ain't that bad.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.439

Excuse me, sir.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.057
You're here to take
the bar exam?

05:57.090 --> 06:00.828
Uh, yes. I took the
first half yesterday.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.029
You weren't here.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.897
The proctors rotate.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.833
Mr. Cohen and I are
on duty today.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.635
You seem confused.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.002
Um... yes.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.838
Someone is sitting
where I sat yesterday,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.473
and I thought it was
same-seatsies.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.809
No, not same-seatsies.
Sit wherever you want.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.479
Most students cluster based on
where they went to law school.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.814
Oh, I didn't go
to law school.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.517
You don't have a law degree?

06:23.551 --> 06:24.918
How do you expect
to pass the bar?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.520
I studied on the flight.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.423
Just find a desk.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.702
You've been pretty
quiet this morning.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.604
One might say moody.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.105
You'd be moody, too,

06:45.138 --> 06:47.808
if you were just thrown out
of a world-class think tank

06:47.841 --> 06:49.009
like the Vor Collective.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.446
Yep. That mood
would be elation.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.413
They're a bunch
of nerd-turds.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.215
Who cares if they don't
like you, Walter?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.217
Uh, that is easy for you to say.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.486
Y-You waltz in,
and in two seconds

06:58.519 --> 06:59.487
they're eating out of your hand.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.155
I can't get humans to like me,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.024
I can't get the mentally enabled
to accept me.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.025
I'm a man without a home.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.193
You have a home.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.728
Scorpion's your home.
I'm your home.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.532
No, I-I know, I just...
this Vor situation,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.901
it's... it's deflating.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.470
Well, then... inflate yourself.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.572
You're in dork heaven.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.509
No, there's a robotics booth,
there's a Trelfie station,

07:21.542 --> 07:24.612
where you take traveling
selfies or something.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.013
Oh, wow, I guess.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.649
Oh, I am excited to
see Richard Elia's

07:28.682 --> 07:29.617
new E-Life presentation.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.520
The E-Life by Elia line
provides high-end

07:32.553 --> 07:34.555
home security, uh,

07:34.588 --> 07:35.789
virtual reality
home movies,

07:35.823 --> 07:36.790
wellness monitoring.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.592
But what I'm really
excited to see

07:38.626 --> 07:40.628
is his new phone banking app.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.563
"Underwritten with
over a billion dollars

07:42.596 --> 07:43.864
"in private equity,
E-Life banking

07:43.897 --> 07:46.099
"provides the common man

07:46.133 --> 07:48.135
Wall Street-quality
financial advice for free."

07:48.168 --> 07:49.169
All through

07:49.202 --> 07:51.672
Barnaby, the Banking Butler.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.840
It's a digital interface to
make the whole experience fun.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.074
You know about the software?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.776
When I was working with Elia,
right after you fired me...

07:55.809 --> 07:57.077
Water under the bridge.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.112
They were coding
the app software.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.714
I'm surprised he's
unveiling it today,

08:00.748 --> 08:03.517
'cause they were way behind
just a few months ago.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.218
Brought all the boxes.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.522
What, what the hell is this?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.190
Oh, these are the boxes
from in the trailer.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.025
No, I said the boxes
by the trailer,

08:12.059 --> 08:13.093
not in the trailer.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.829
Intern.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.131
Well, they all say "marketing."

08:18.165 --> 08:20.601
Oh, that's stuff
Ray put together

08:20.634 --> 08:22.002
during the month
he took over Paige's job.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.704
Right after you fired me.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.972
Really got to let that go.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.841
Can you just go get the stuff
I made? Posters, flowcharts...

08:27.875 --> 08:29.009
Morning traffic,
he won't get back

08:29.042 --> 08:30.177
before things start up here.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.079
Just dig through the box,
see if there's

08:32.112 --> 08:33.581
anything salvageable.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.215
Oh, man, it's Vadat.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.219
Okay, let's just play it cool.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.022
Hey, Vadat, so, uh,
it's really funny

08:42.055 --> 08:43.657
to be seeing you
two days in a row.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.125
Are you...

08:45.158 --> 08:48.095
you looking forward
to a little Tech-Splosion?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.164
Ms. Dineen, it's lovely
to see you again.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.633
We've got a booth
to recruit new members,

08:52.666 --> 08:55.669
so feel free to stop by
for refreshments.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.904
Our ice is safe.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.672
CABE:
Hey, Walt.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.108
I found a DVD.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.811
Scorpion.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.978
Computers.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.046
Adventure!

09:06.079 --> 09:07.047
Sinkhole!

09:07.080 --> 09:08.181
Whatever your needs,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.217
Scorpion is genius.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.321
Star wipe.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.322
VADAT:
Wow.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.324
Impressive.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.192
Oh, that just ruined
any chance I have

09:19.226 --> 09:21.061
of getting back
into the Vor Collective.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.731
Uh, Walter, it was
not about the video.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.733
I have two words for you:

09:25.766 --> 09:27.901
explosive diarrhea.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.704
And that's my cue
to go take a walk.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.906
Ray Spiewack is a man of action.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.908
He's the leader of the Scorpion.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.077
Ray Spiewack is super sexy.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.847
Come on, everybody,
we're gonna have some fun.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.184
Stressed out?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.385
Job pressures?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.387
Wish you could
shut out the world?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.922
And how.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.092
Try the Senseless
3000, the future

09:52.125 --> 09:53.794
of high-tech
sensory deprivation.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.996
This one
of those quiet tanks?

09:56.029 --> 09:59.332
Oh. You heard
me rehearsing.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.934
How'd my pitch sound?

10:00.968 --> 10:02.402
Intriguing.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.436
Good.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.939
Did you know the best part
about this product?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.941
Space-age memory foam
that'll make you feel

10:07.975 --> 10:10.110
completely weightless
and at peace.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.979
No bright lights,
no sound...

10:12.012 --> 10:14.915
No crappy car, no trial.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.850
Why don't you take her
for a spin?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.385
Yeah?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.953
Yeah.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.990
Sit here.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.860
Just, uh, settle in there.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.963
There you go.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.666
(grunts)
It's pretty comfy.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.769
Well, I'm gonna run to my car
and grab some promo T-shirts,

10:35.803 --> 10:38.772
but, uh, the door doesn't lock,
so you can exit anytime.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.708
Okay.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.409
Enjoy, sir.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.047
PAIGE:
Okay. See you soon.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.248
That was Toby and Happy.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.083
They're running late. They're
picking up organic coffee.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.919
Part of their STORK thing.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.788
What is with those guys
and acronyms?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.224
(gunshots)
Everybody, hands up!

10:57.257 --> 10:58.225
(people screaming)

10:58.258 --> 11:00.027
Follow our instructions,
and no one gets hurt!

11:01.895 --> 11:02.896
Let's get out of here.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.397
There is no way out!

11:05.899 --> 11:07.968
Doors are rigged
with explosives.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.972
You open one door,
they all detonate.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.474
Now, everybody
into the main theater. Now!

11:14.507 --> 11:16.877
Move!
(gunshots continue)

11:16.910 --> 11:19.146
(people screaming)
Move! Move!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.749
Move!

11:26.453 --> 11:28.922
(speaking Spanish)

11:28.956 --> 11:29.990
Move, move!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.291
(men shouting in Spanish)

11:31.324 --> 11:33.326
Move!

11:37.064 --> 11:38.799
Richard.

11:38.832 --> 11:42.435
Why is it every time you guys
are around, things turn to crap?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.004
All cell phones in here.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.474
(speaking in Spanish)

11:47.507 --> 11:49.476
Cell phones, now.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.311
Rápido. (whispering): Where's that
older guy you guys were with?

11:51.344 --> 11:52.345
Did-did he get away?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.247
Walt, he's right,
Cabe's not here.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.783
Don't worry, Mr. Vadat.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.251
My associate is
a trained federal agent.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.953
I guarantee
he's working right now

11:59.987 --> 12:01.989
toward a way
of getting us out of here.

12:02.022 --> 12:06.059
♪ Are the voices in your head

12:06.093 --> 12:09.830
♪ Calling Gloria...

12:10.864 --> 12:12.866
♪ Gloria. ♪

12:19.539 --> 12:22.509
(sirens wailing)

12:22.542 --> 12:24.444
LEADER (over tablet): Richard
Elia and his technological ilk

12:24.477 --> 12:27.114
are nothing more
than digital pusher men,

12:27.147 --> 12:30.150
getting the populace hooked
on fingertip convenience:

12:30.183 --> 12:34.087
instant access to music,
films, information,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.523
with notification chimes
engineered

12:36.556 --> 12:39.259
to release endorphins,
to get the sheep addicted,

12:39.292 --> 12:42.495
unaware their personal data's
being harvested and sold,

12:42.529 --> 12:43.931
until, one day,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.800
privacy as we know it
is gone forever.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.436
Did you really do that
with chimes?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.804
Maybe.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.840
Mr. Elia has two hours

12:52.873 --> 12:55.008
to destroy all personal data
he's collected

12:55.042 --> 12:57.044
from users of his technology

12:57.077 --> 12:58.946
over the past 20 years.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.414
The thoughts,
habits and profiles of billions

13:01.448 --> 13:04.384
will be liberated
from Elia's grasp.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.986
We'll never get
that done in time.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.022
If a single e-mail remains,

13:09.056 --> 13:11.524
we will execute every hostage.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.027
And lest Elia's tech team doubts

13:14.061 --> 13:15.362
whether they should
heed our demands...

13:17.998 --> 13:22.235
...if they don't, Sir Richard
receives the first bullet.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.237
Do it.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.605
Do what he says.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.907
These guys mean it.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.075
COP:
Detective Meller!

13:28.108 --> 13:29.376
Detective.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.078
These guys drove
up to the barricade.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.080
They say there's a federal agent
embedded with the hostages.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.348
Uh, Dr. Toby Curtis, Happy
Quinn, we work for Scorpion.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.984
A federal subcontractor

13:37.017 --> 13:39.086
under the direction
of Homeland Agent Cabe Gallo.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.054
Look, well, I recorded
the kidnappers' demands.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.555
It's our only look inside

13:42.589 --> 13:44.091
since they disabled
the security cameras.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.259
You can see the hostages
in the background.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.995
Which one is the federal agent?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.429
Uh, there's Walt and Paige.
And...

13:49.462 --> 13:50.563
Elia but no Cabe.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.966
He's got to be hiding in
the outer concourse somewhere.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.001
Ah, this is good.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.402
Oh, that's good.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.070
She normally says "Not good."

13:57.104 --> 13:58.271
What the hell
are you two talking about?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.207
What we're talking about is that
we have a man on the inside,

14:00.240 --> 14:02.009
and he's a badass.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
(whirring)

14:07.114 --> 14:09.449
(exhales)

14:09.482 --> 14:11.484
(grunts)

14:13.486 --> 14:15.488
(sighs)

14:24.431 --> 14:26.599
Where the hell is everybody?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.538
(beeping steadily)

14:38.011 --> 14:39.379
This is bad.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.114
FOX: Mezzanine is clear.
Checking the floor. Over.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.050
(radio crackles)

14:43.083 --> 14:44.051
(footsteps approaching)

14:52.159 --> 14:54.127
What the hell's going on?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.299
(phone ringing)

15:16.316 --> 15:18.151
(grunting)

15:28.161 --> 15:30.163
(choking)

15:36.036 --> 15:37.037
(grunts)

15:40.140 --> 15:42.175
(phone ringing)

15:42.209 --> 15:45.045
(grunts)

15:45.078 --> 15:47.047
CABE: Yeah.
Cabe, where the hell you been?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.350
Napping. Hold on,
I'm putting my Bluetooth in.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.220
So I assume you're aware
that something crazy's

15:53.253 --> 15:53.720
going down in here.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.155
Fill me in.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.489
Yeah, anti-tech group
has got, like,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.358
12 people at gunpoint
in the theater,

15:58.391 --> 16:00.493
including Walter and Paige,
and Elia's in there, too.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.195
(grunting)

16:02.229 --> 16:03.663
How many bad guys?

16:03.696 --> 16:06.366
Uh, looks like
there's four in there.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.634
Well, in case you're unaware...

16:09.269 --> 16:10.470
...this place is rigged
to blow to bits

16:10.503 --> 16:11.571
if any of these doors
are opened.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.006
HAPPY:
The authorities know.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
Barricades are all around,
cops are everywhere.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.309
Is that Agent Gallo?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.245
Hand it over. Agent Gallo,

16:18.278 --> 16:19.646
this is Detective Meller, LAPD.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.314
Hey, Detective.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.384
Be advised, I've already
taken out one Caucasian male,

16:24.417 --> 16:26.219
early 30s.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.421
And I'm in possession
of a SIG 9mm.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.457
Sir,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.092
I ran your badge number,
and the system says

16:32.125 --> 16:34.427
that you've been suspended
for being charged

16:34.461 --> 16:35.495
with felonious conduct.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.596
Not good.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.200
Yeah. I told you she
normally says that.

16:40.233 --> 16:44.037
We will be relieving you
of this.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.273
Password to your
company's server?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.440
Why do you need it?

16:47.474 --> 16:49.109
I ordered my staff
to delete all data.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.277
They're doing it as we speak.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.811
I want my team
to watch your team.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.812
Make sure all those terabytes

16:52.845 --> 16:55.348
are dwindling down to zero
like they should.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.416
The password.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.521
"King Richard."

17:04.724 --> 17:06.693
It's easy to remember.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.828
(typing)
(computer beeps)

17:08.861 --> 17:10.363
Mr. Gallo.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.631
How do you feel about being

17:11.664 --> 17:14.401
criminally prosecuted
by your employer?

17:14.434 --> 17:15.468
I'm tickled pink.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.637
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.339
You think Cabe is in on it?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.541
Well, I'm looking at a
disgruntled federal employee,

17:21.574 --> 17:22.742
discharged five years

17:22.775 --> 17:25.478
from retirement, who's already
admitted that he's armed,

17:25.512 --> 17:26.779
and neutralized one person.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.182
A bad guy. I took out a bad guy.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.318
N-No, that's my phone,
and you are crazy

17:31.351 --> 17:32.452
if you think my friend's crazy.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.121
I have seen many agents snap,

17:34.154 --> 17:36.123
and I don't know whose
side this guy is on.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.624
Detective,
press is getting antsy.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.792
They want a statement.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.162
Don't let them leave. I still
got questions for them.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.530
I don't know what's
going on here.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.798
Uh, Cabe? You-you got to avoid
running into anyone else

17:45.832 --> 17:47.500
until we can figure out a plan.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.435
RAVEN (over radio):
Fox, this is Raven.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.237
I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.571
I need you to get me
a Flashcat cable

17:51.604 --> 17:52.672
from one of the booths
out there.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.507
Do you copy?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.809
What's the issue?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.678
It's not connecting
to the final page.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.414
It's probably a bad cable.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.483
Fox, ETA on that Flashcat?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.252
Do you copy?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.487
Probably left his walkie off.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.521
I'll just grab
it myself.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.789
Just be quick about it.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.659
I'm worried about Cabe.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.794
What if the guy runs into him?

18:14.827 --> 18:18.131
Well, if that happens, Cabe's
not the one I'm worried about.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.567
They're gonna send someone
when that guy I knocked out

18:20.600 --> 18:22.435
doesn't come back with a cable.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.172
TOBY: Cabe, just make yourself
scarce and-and be careful.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.606
Look, man, I-I got to go.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.807
We got to figure out a way
to see what's going on

18:27.840 --> 18:28.741
in that theater.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.942
How the hell are we
gonna get eyes in there?

18:29.976 --> 18:33.646
I checked online. There's no
security cameras in the theater.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.616
Um, we'll hack Walt's laptop,
we'll spy through his eyepiece.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.617
There's no way
that the kidnappers

18:37.650 --> 18:40.253
will let Walt open his laptop.
They're hostages.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.489
They probably can't even move,
let alone take out their toys.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.225
Well, that's it.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.593
Elia's toys.
They're already out.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.795
H-He was unveiling
a host of new devices today.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.863
Pull up the
Tech-Splosion website.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.303
Eyes on your own paper.

18:56.336 --> 19:00.440
(phone vibrating)

19:00.473 --> 19:01.874
(phone clicks)

19:04.611 --> 19:06.713
(sighs)

19:07.880 --> 19:09.549
A hostage situation?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.551
Yeah, I don't have any time
to explain.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.952
Now, listen to me.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.020
If I were gonna find

19:14.053 --> 19:17.557
a Flashcat cable in this joint,
where would I go?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.426
I have to think that they'd
have a robotics booth.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.593
That would have a Flashcat.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.496
Okay.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.232
I see some robot stuff.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.400
Get in touch
with Toby and Happy.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.601
They'll download you.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.504
Things are really bad.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.274
Really, really bad.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.608
Oh, please don't hang up,
please don't hang...

19:35.642 --> 19:36.676
(groans)

19:36.709 --> 19:39.646
I'm in the middle
of taking the bar exam. Crap.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.722
There it is.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.793
Flashcat cable.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.562
(whirring)

19:55.595 --> 19:56.729
What the hell?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.770
Two down.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.572
Cops think Cabe is involved?

20:05.605 --> 20:06.373
That is insane.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.840
Listen, Happy's hacking
the camera

20:07.874 --> 20:10.277
in Elia's facial-recognition
doorbell display.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.944
It's gonna give us
a live peek into that theater.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.313
Once we get some intel,

20:13.346 --> 20:14.481
we'll probably need your help,

20:14.514 --> 20:15.948
so stay by the phone?

20:15.982 --> 20:17.284
Okay, please don't hang up. I...
(groans)

20:17.317 --> 20:19.319
Double crap.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.625
Busted.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.993
Triple crap.
Sir, you are hereby

20:27.026 --> 20:29.262
expelled from this bar
examination for cheating.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.930
Okay. Hold on.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.665
This is not a game show.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.635
You do not get a lifeline
when you don't know the answers.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.270
Please, if you just let me
get my laptop

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
out from under my desk
out there, I can show you

20:39.306 --> 20:41.408
case files that prove
that I work in conjunction

20:41.441 --> 20:44.010
with Homeland Security,
as well as news feeds online

20:44.043 --> 20:45.945
of a Los Angeles
hostage situation

20:45.978 --> 20:47.547
that I am currently
assisting with.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.351
You are either
telling the truth,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.720
or that is the coolest lie
I have ever heard.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.889
Wait here.
I'll go get the proof.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.458
Raven, do you copy?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.593
Raven!

21:00.627 --> 21:02.495
He's getting frustrated.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.064
Frustrated kidnappers
hurt people.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.066
I'm sure Cabe's disrupted
his plans.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.369
Now we need a plan of our own.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.304
No. You're reckless.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.073
I promise you, I have solved
many difficult cases.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.343
But he does have a point.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.077
You wrecked my Ferrari,
lost software

21:18.110 --> 21:20.079
that cost me a billion-dollar
smart building,

21:20.112 --> 21:21.414
discharged my space rocket.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.316
He gave me explosive diarrhea.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.419
You win.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.822
CABE:
All right.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.824
Anybody come up
with a strategy yet?

21:31.858 --> 21:34.060
It's like Whack-A-Mole
around here.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.762
Bad guys keep coming
out of the woodwork.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.930
Okay, I am hacking
Elia's doorbell hardware

21:37.964 --> 21:40.032
so we can get eyes
on the situation...

21:40.066 --> 21:41.401
I'm in.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.635
Great. What do you see?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.771
Empty theater seats.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.639
They need to turn
the camera toward them.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.509
Yeah, well, do whatever you can
to get their attention.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.478
I am doing that right now.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.650
Psst.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.752
(whispering): Am I the only one
who sees that light blinking?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.423
It's Morse code.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.457
It's Happy.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.758
How do you know?

22:05.792 --> 22:08.495
Because the doorbell just
said, "It's me, stupid."

22:08.528 --> 22:10.730
We need a distraction
so I can get it.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.900
Fox and Raven
are not responding.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.134
We need to get this done
and get out.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.704
(clears throat)
Hey, uh, excuse me...

22:17.737 --> 22:19.739
Sit down. Uh... If you're
trying to get into my system,

22:19.772 --> 22:20.973
I think I can help.
LEADER: I said sit.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.142
I'm just saying that I think
that I could help assist you...

22:23.175 --> 22:25.678
(people screaming)
(grunts)

22:27.914 --> 22:28.948
Stay back.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.750
This is not your boardroom.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.118
You are not in charge!

22:32.151 --> 22:33.553
(Elia grunts)

22:33.586 --> 22:35.588
(Elia grunting)

22:35.622 --> 22:36.956
Here.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.426
(Leader continues kicking)

22:39.459 --> 22:40.893
Well, we got Walt's POV.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.463
Okay, link his audio
with Cabe's Bluetooth.

22:43.496 --> 22:46.599
Look, we're getting a visual
right through his shirt pocket.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.402
Oh, man, Elia's getting it bad.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.169
(grunts)

22:50.202 --> 22:51.871
Stop! Stop! Stop!

22:51.904 --> 22:53.406
I'm the best hacker here.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.941
Yeah, I-I'll get you
into Elia's server,

22:54.974 --> 22:56.409
you can see the d-data
being deleted.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.209
Just-just leave him alone, okay?

22:57.243 --> 22:59.178
LEADER: If you're
playing games,

22:59.211 --> 23:00.847
people die.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.683
Respectfully,
I am a programmer by trade.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.184
But I'm a skilled hacker.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.420
Oh, as skilled as you are
with toxic micro-bacteria?

23:07.454 --> 23:08.888
Forgive me if I
don't trust you with my life.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.056
LEADER:
Enough.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.558
You both say
you can do the job,

23:11.591 --> 23:12.625
then you both
do the job.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.861
And you both have blood
on your hands if you fail.

23:14.894 --> 23:15.895
But you are not going
to be looking

23:15.928 --> 23:17.497
at Elia's data deletion.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.198
If this isn't about
destroying the data

23:19.231 --> 23:22.401
he collected, why are we here?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.074
This is about Elia's
banking software.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.177
Smart man.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.713
And whether my men have gotten
cold feet and abandoned me,

23:33.746 --> 23:35.014
or have been intercepted
by forces

23:35.047 --> 23:36.182
outside that theater door,

23:36.215 --> 23:38.451
I am not
leaving without my money.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.019
You have my people
obsessively deleting data

23:40.052 --> 23:42.555
so they won't notice the bank
accounts are being emptied.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.756
Correct.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.558
Both of you,

23:45.592 --> 23:46.493
over here, and get to work.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.464
(Elia exhales)

23:55.001 --> 23:56.469
That was pretty brave of you,

23:56.503 --> 23:58.971
creating a distraction.

23:59.005 --> 24:02.108
Yeah, well, you won't be
very proud of me in a moment.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.176
Why?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.846
I never finished
the bank software.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.881
There is no money.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.253
(quietly): This
isn't working...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.622
Yes, there's a defective cable.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.056
We've known that for some time.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.258
Nope. There's nothing wrong
with the connecting cable.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.827
The software isn't working.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.797
Oh, no. Oh, no.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.567
We can't help them rob
Elia's bank because...

24:27.600 --> 24:28.668
There is no bank.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.637
Coding won't be done
for six months.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.639
But t-today's presentation...?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.206
Smoke and mirrors.
None of it's ready.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.276
Not the software,
not Barnaby the Banking Butler,

24:37.309 --> 24:38.745
and definitely not the funding

24:38.778 --> 24:40.279
that these guys
are trying to siphon off.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.247
Once the kidnappers realize

24:41.280 --> 24:42.949
that there's no pennies
in the piggy bank...

24:42.982 --> 24:44.984
They have no reason
to keep the hostages alive.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.795
I want all funds transferred
to this account number

24:55.828 --> 24:57.997
in Gibraltar.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.231
Problem?

24:59.265 --> 25:01.100
No. No, no.
I can hack this.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.202
It's just, uh,
well-designed software,

25:03.235 --> 25:04.571
so it will take a while.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.705
You have five minutes.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.813
Okay, Walt will stall
for a 300 count

25:13.846 --> 25:16.082
while we try
to save everyone in there.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.750
CABE (grunting): All right.
You guys got to build

25:17.784 --> 25:19.786
some kind of fake bank site
or something

25:19.819 --> 25:23.255
so it'll look like Walter is
doing what that bastard wants.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.657
Happy and I aren't
skilled enough

25:24.691 --> 25:26.292
to pull that off fast.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.660
I know the young esquire who is.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.228
Uh, hold on.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.264
Stopped a nuclear satellite
from hitting L.A.,

25:32.298 --> 25:35.768
rescued a drowning
woman from a tar pit.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.870
Your team's done
some pretty amazing work.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.873
And now, this convention center
is being overrun

25:40.907 --> 25:43.610
by a madman.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
And I need to help my friends.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.814
Okay, man. Here's the deal.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.722
(garbage crunching, sloshing)

25:55.755 --> 25:57.590
Sit there, use the
sink as a desk.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.291
I'll watch you, make sure
everything's on the up and up.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.893
That's not really sanitary.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.729
There's somewhere else
you can sit.

26:02.762 --> 26:03.830
(water gurgling in toilet)

26:03.863 --> 26:05.031
I'll take the garbage can.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.933
(phone vibrating)

26:06.966 --> 26:08.300
Toby.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.769
Sly, I-I got Cabe patched in.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.569
Here's a ten-second recap.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.839
The bad guys don't
hate technology.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.607
They want to rob
Elia's new bank.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.975
But there is no bank.
Elia never set it up,

26:16.008 --> 26:17.744
so Walter's about to be
killed because he's hacking

26:17.777 --> 26:19.311
a banking Web site
that doesn't exist.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.213
Oh, boy.
Suppose I should whip up

26:21.247 --> 26:23.382
a fancy pseudo-site
to buy him some time?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.383
Yeah, Walter's got about

26:24.416 --> 26:25.317
four and a half minutes
until he takes a bullet.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.854
(whispers):
Oh, man, this is intense...

26:27.887 --> 26:29.922
Yeah, I could whip up
something basic for him,

26:29.956 --> 26:32.224
I could hack into the router
at the convention center,

26:32.258 --> 26:33.893
and then Walter could find it.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.762
Cabe, I just got an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.363
(Cabe grunting)

26:37.396 --> 26:38.865
All right. Whatever it takes.
I don't care...

26:38.898 --> 26:40.066
TOBY:
Hold on.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.868
The kidnappers are eventually
gonna expect to see money

26:41.901 --> 26:43.202
in their account.
How do you fix that?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.371
They're using
Imperial Gibraltar Bank.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.840
It's a haven for criminal funds.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.842
Well, I don't have enough time
to set up the fake site

26:49.876 --> 26:50.977
and hack a bank.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.344
If we could get right
into the server,

26:52.378 --> 26:55.014
then I could mask their
wire transfer protocols,

26:55.047 --> 26:57.183
make it look to the bad guys
that they just got their funds.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.418
Fine. Then Toby and I
will get you the password

26:59.451 --> 27:00.920
to the bank's servers
to save you time.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.823
H-How? It's not like
we can get to Spain.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.424
Imperial Gibraltar Bank has
branches all over the U.S.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.759
to launder dirty money.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.161
There's one in Bellflower.
Let's hit it.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.163
Hold on!

27:11.197 --> 27:12.799
Detective Meller says
you need to stay put.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.433
Look, I understand y-your
psychological need

27:14.466 --> 27:16.669
to blindly follow authority,
but Detective Meller's a putz.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.804
There are people in there
counting on us.

27:17.837 --> 27:21.140
And one of them is under
suspicion of pulling this stunt,

27:21.173 --> 27:23.275
and you've just admitted
to being on his team,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.844
so you're both
under suspicion, too.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.178
Neither of you
are going anywhere.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.947
Excuse me, Detective.
(clears throat)

27:27.980 --> 27:29.882
This is Sylvester Dodd,
attorney at law.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.950
(whispering):
You can't say that.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.885
If you are telling my clients

27:32.919 --> 27:35.454
that they can't move, then that
is a custodial interrogation

27:35.487 --> 27:37.156
and as such,
you must formally arrest them.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.292
That's what we're
trying to avoid, Sly.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.161
However, you've already stated
that they are under suspicion

27:42.194 --> 27:43.763
merely because
they work with someone

27:43.796 --> 27:47.166
who you believe may be involved
with a hostage-taking.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.836
And you must know that
under the law mere suspicion

27:49.869 --> 27:51.370
is not enough for an arrest.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.939
You have to have reasonable,

27:52.972 --> 27:55.341
articulable suspicion in order
to bring my clients in.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.209
Well, do you?
Other than a hunch?

27:57.243 --> 27:58.845
W-What are the facts?

27:58.878 --> 27:59.979
Can you lay them out for me?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.814
Otherwise, since you've
already admitted

28:01.848 --> 28:03.315
that you don't meet
the legal standard,

28:03.349 --> 28:05.752
I look forward
to the massive civil suit

28:05.785 --> 28:08.420
that I will file against you
for wrongful arrest.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.956
In fact,

28:09.989 --> 28:11.357
I hope that you do arrest them.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.992
I can put another wing
on my house.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.461
Matlock, baby.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.832
(car doors opening and closing)

28:19.866 --> 28:22.001
(tires squeal)

28:23.870 --> 28:26.839
I'm such an idiot.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.507
One press of this,

28:28.540 --> 28:32.011
and I'd rise out of a trap door
and onto the stage.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.247
Had this place rigged
so balloons would drop,

28:35.281 --> 28:38.117
strobe lights, confetti canons,
music blaring--

28:38.150 --> 28:40.252
all to distract from the fact

28:40.286 --> 28:43.489
that my product wasn't real yet.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.291
All style, no substance--

28:45.324 --> 28:47.426
that's not how I like to think
of myself.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.996
You took a beating to
help everyone here.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.363
That's substance.

28:51.397 --> 28:55.134
I care so much about
what people think of me,

28:55.167 --> 28:57.837
of being accepted
by Silicon Valley

28:57.870 --> 29:00.539
and these 20 year-old idiots
designing the latest apps.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.408
Supposed to be
smarter than that.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.976
Seems no matter
how smart you are,

29:04.010 --> 29:07.213
being accepted
will always matter.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.953
You're just vamping here.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.454
You can't just
keep typing gibberish.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.123
My team knows
our predicament.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.324
I don't know what
they're planning,

29:18.357 --> 29:19.525
but they are
planning something,

29:19.558 --> 29:20.993
so, please, trust me.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.964
In one minute,
I kill one hostage.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.232
Perhaps...

29:26.265 --> 29:28.234
the pretty girl
you were sitting with.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.902
No, no. No, no, no! No. No, No.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.403
That won't be necessary.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.240
I'm almost into the software
for the banking Web site

29:34.273 --> 29:37.009
and I-I will direct it to
transfer you your money, okay?

29:37.043 --> 29:38.477
HAPPY:
Sly, get that fake site

29:38.510 --> 29:41.080
operational now or
Paige is done for.

29:41.113 --> 29:41.780
Okay. I am almost finished.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.083
Cabe, you better be in position.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.919
All right, almost ready.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.424
SYLVESTER: Hacking the Trelfie
computer into my interface now.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.560
I'm gonna keep you in a mid-shot

29:54.593 --> 29:57.496
so the Bluetooth in your ear
isn't as noticeable.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.231
20 seconds.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.499
Get her up.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.070
Hey. Hey. Hey!

30:05.137 --> 30:06.538
(hostages screaming)

30:06.572 --> 30:08.107
This isn't anyone's hero time!

30:08.140 --> 30:09.441
In ten seconds, she dies.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.243
Please, please, please.
I can solve this.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.013
I can solve it. Just...
Five seconds.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.214
(cash register bell rings)

30:15.247 --> 30:16.983
(British accent):
Hello.

30:17.016 --> 30:21.020
I'm Barnaby,
your banking butler,

30:21.053 --> 30:23.956
faithful financial friend.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.958
SYLVESTER:
Okay, guys.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.093
You need to get the password
from the bank

30:27.126 --> 30:28.560
so I can get into their system

30:28.594 --> 30:29.862
and fake the transfer.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.131
(brakes squeal)

30:33.265 --> 30:34.500
Just got here. We're on it.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.640
Okay. I have entered
your account number.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.109
CABE (British accent):
Jolly good, gov'nor.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.878
I've received your order

30:45.912 --> 30:48.280
for a wiring of funds.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.282
It will be several minutes

30:50.316 --> 30:53.886
before I can provide
a confirmation.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.455
Tell me when
the transfer's done.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.992
You're still
taking the exam?

31:00.026 --> 31:02.461
(sighs) Yes. The bar isn't
offered again until February,

31:02.494 --> 31:04.630
and I need to become
a lawyer ASAP.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.032
Are you sure about this?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.433
No, but we need the password

31:07.466 --> 31:09.268
and this is the fastest way
to get it. Now let's go.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.370
Th-th-- Just-just,
read the note one more time.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.372
"This is a robbery.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.607
Give us your server password
and no one gets hurt."

31:15.641 --> 31:16.909
It's direct and clear.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.010
Th-that's a good note.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.912
Good luck, baby.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.014
I'm gonna keep
my fingers crossed for you.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.085
Fine.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.056
It-it really only takes one
person to hand over a note.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.299
CABE (British accent):
Transferring funds.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.668
All is hunky-dory.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.171
Please stand by.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.706
It's amazing
we're still alive,

31:47.739 --> 31:50.342
'cause his accent sucks.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.311
Let's get ready to get
out of here.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.981
If that money
doesn't come through...

31:55.014 --> 31:57.283
Where the hell is it?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.151
We'll get this done.

31:59.185 --> 32:02.688
Scorpion is a group
of professionals.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.024
(alarm ringing)
(yelling)

32:05.057 --> 32:06.492
Sly, the password is B-9-T...

32:06.525 --> 32:07.726
How did they get it?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.029
I think they just robbed a bank.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.597
HAPPY:
Put the police channel

32:11.630 --> 32:13.632

32:43.429 --> 32:45.097
(grunting)

32:53.039 --> 32:54.773
Oh, man, Barnaby's

32:54.806 --> 32:56.342
Cabe, you better win already.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.610
I'm about to make it
look like those jerks

32:58.644 --> 33:00.246

33:12.124 --> 33:14.793
Done. They have
the fake cash.

Uh, Barnaby, time's up.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.330

Straighten your tie and get

33:25.104 --> 33:26.772
CABE:
Sir,

33:26.805 --> 33:30.642
(panting): your funds
have been transferred,

33:30.676 --> 33:36.182
$1 billion to the Imperial
Gibraltar Bank account

33:36.215 --> 33:38.050
number 0-6-

33:38.084 --> 33:40.486
0-1-4-5.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.820

33:47.126 --> 33:48.527

33:52.098 --> 33:54.333
And I'll keep mine.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.801
Now, back with the others!

33:58.270 --> 34:00.139
(siren wailing)
I hear sirens.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.240
This is not good.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.409
Police pursuits are stressful.
and that violates STORK.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.144
(passing horn honking)
So does being in jail.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.787
You're supposed to be wearing boxers!
STORK, remember?

34:25.197 --> 34:27.433
I-I thought you said
you wouldn't kill us.

34:27.466 --> 34:31.103
I'm not. I'm just gonna
wound you all very badly.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.438
Gunshots to the abdomen

34:32.471 --> 34:34.540

34:34.573 --> 34:36.375
So when the police race in here,

34:36.408 --> 34:38.844
they'll be too busy doing triage
to follow us.

34:38.877 --> 34:39.611
So thank you

37:42.961 --> 37:45.464
Barnaby?

37:45.497 --> 37:47.866
Thanks for the shortcut, kid.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.668
Bad guys are down.
All is well.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.037
Roger that, Cabe.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.473
Now it's time to get
back to the test.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.807
Uh, yeah, about that.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.344
Uh... time ran out
a few minutes ago.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.511
Test's over.

37:59.545 --> 38:00.679
What?

38:00.712 --> 38:04.015
I was only able to finish
about 70% of the questions.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.852
For what it's worth,
world's got lots of lawyers.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.687
Not many heroes, though.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.622
Thanks.

38:10.656 --> 38:14.292
Problem is,
my friend needs a lawyer.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.862
(sighs heavily)

38:16.895 --> 38:19.698
Mr. Curtis, Mrs.
Quinn, I apologize

38:19.731 --> 38:21.700
for my error
in judgment.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.803
It's okay, you can't help it--
you have a small brain.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.373
How about I arrest you
for public indecency?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.507
Or he can keep his mouth shut,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.409
put his pants on,
and we can go home.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.077
I like her idea.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.514
Me, too.

38:39.585 --> 38:43.389
Well, with all the press here,
it's only a matter of time

38:43.422 --> 38:45.457
before it gets out
that I was prepared

38:45.491 --> 38:47.526
to put on a bogus
dog-and-pony show today.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.428
It's funny,
there was a time

38:49.461 --> 38:51.963
when I cared about the science,

38:51.997 --> 38:55.501
technology, about what's
actually important to society,

38:55.534 --> 38:58.370
not just about looking important
to certain groups of people.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.708
Don't be so hard on yourself.

39:02.741 --> 39:06.512
You know, anyone could
have fallen into that trap.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.481
Real quick thinking
with that trapdoor in there.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.750
Any chance I could
steal you back from Scorpion?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.785
(chuckles)
Nope.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.456
Kinda... got a
thing for my boss.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.524
Well, hopefully,
next time

39:18.557 --> 39:20.659
I see you two...
(groans)

39:20.692 --> 39:22.894
...it doesn't involve
a catastrophe.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.597
But I won't hold my breath.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.638
I, uh...
wanted to say thanks.

39:32.671 --> 39:36.475
We never would have survived
if it wasn't for you.

39:36.508 --> 39:37.843
Both of you.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.778
Well, thank you, Vadat.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.114
I guess that means I'm back
into the Vor Collective?

39:43.148 --> 39:44.683
Seriously?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.452
No.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.786
Explosive diarrhea?

39:47.819 --> 39:50.622
Kind of a hard thing
for the fellas to look past.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.658
I understand.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.993
(exhales):
(chuckles)

39:55.026 --> 39:57.429
Let's go home.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.733
Mmm. Boston cream.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.570
I got jelly in my belly and
a bear claw with my name on it.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.005
I thought donuts
violate STORK.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.974
We're scrapping STORK.
Yeah.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.676
Now we're focusing on fun.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.545
Good. We're done with
the stupid acronyms.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.648
No. Freewheeling
Unencumbered Newlyweds.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.186
What's up
with him?

40:21.219 --> 40:24.923
Oh, he's trying to find
a loophole to the bar exam.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.058
All you have to do is ask
if you can represent yourself.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.495
Kid... Then I could be your paralegal,
and I can co-chair with you,

40:29.528 --> 40:30.596
and feed you advice...
Sly...

40:30.629 --> 40:31.863
Well, no,
there's a few cases

40:31.897 --> 40:33.098
where this would
actually work. It's...

40:33.131 --> 40:34.232
Sylvester.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.200
You did the
best you could.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.903
You tried to do
the impossible for me.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.638
No matter what happens
with my case,

40:39.671 --> 40:42.974
I'm a hell of a lucky guy
to have a friend like you.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.578
All right?

40:48.079 --> 40:50.582
(sets mug down)
All right, I'm heading home.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.118
Oh. Hey, Pops,

40:53.151 --> 40:53.985
some of my online

40:54.019 --> 40:56.522
gearhead pals have
cheap cars for sale.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.490
More reliable than that heap.

40:58.524 --> 41:02.127
(sighs) You know, I caught
two bad guys with this baby.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.995
Not to mention,

41:04.029 --> 41:06.865
the motorcycles crashing
into the wagon jarred

41:06.898 --> 41:09.167
the cassette tape loose.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.169
No, I'm sticking with it.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.279
(starts engine)

41:21.312 --> 41:24.583
(engine squeaking, chugging)

41:26.117 --> 41:28.153
(engine knocks loudly)

41:29.287 --> 41:32.691
(loud clattering,
engine sputters, dies)

41:32.724 --> 41:34.760
CABE:
Little help?!

41:34.793 --> 41:36.061
How much farther?

41:36.094 --> 41:38.830
Closest garage, uh,
with a lift is three miles.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.298
Nah, two words--
"tow truck."

41:40.331 --> 41:42.200
Two words:
"We're broke."

41:42.233 --> 41:44.570
You know what I want?
For Paige to push for a while.

41:44.603 --> 41:47.038
(phone vibrating) What was that?
I can't hear you.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.807
Guys, I passed
the bar!

41:48.840 --> 41:50.141
Oh, fantastic!

41:50.175 --> 41:51.843
Way to go, Sly!

41:51.877 --> 41:53.679
The proctor must have put
a rush on my results.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.046
I only finished 70%
of the test.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.615
But I guess I got
all 70 right.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.216
Congratulations, Counselor.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.252
(chuckles) You know,
JD means Juris Doctor.

42:01.286 --> 42:02.721
You're
not a doctor.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.056
Sylvester Dodd, the doctor--
sounds pretty good.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.559
You're not a doctor. HAPPY:
Really need Paige to push now.

42:07.593 --> 42:08.660
PAIGE:
Huh? What was that?

42:08.694 --> 42:09.661
Still can't hear you.
