BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS IS MR.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.636
BECAUSE I REALLY NEED,
LIKE, TWO OR THREE.

( doorbell rings )

02:54.174 --> 02:56.844
OH HI. UH, NO ONE
ORDERED PIZZA HERE.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.713
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'D LOVE A SLICE.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.483
NO, I'M ONE OF THE
BUSINESS GRANT WINNERS.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.319
WOW, I SHOULD'VE WORN
MY COCKTAIL HELMET.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.688
I HAD NO IDEA THIS
COUNCILMAN MEL BURKE GUY

03:07.721 --> 03:09.690
WAS HOLDING SUCH
A FORMAL AFFAIR.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.860
- UH, COUNCILMAN? STUFFED
SHIRTS IS HE? HESE

03:12.893 --> 03:14.662
WELL, CAN'T YOU TELL
JUST BY LOOKING?

03:14.695 --> 03:19.433
I MEAN, SINCE THE COUNCILMAN IS
OBVIOUSLY SOME OLD WHITE GUY?

03:19.467 --> 03:21.535
WELL, CLEARLY I'M
UNDERDRESSED FOR THIS.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.604
NO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.806
YOU'VE GOT THOSE ON YOUR PANTS.S

03:25.839 --> 03:27.608
OH YEAH. ( chuckles )

03:27.641 --> 03:29.677
YOU THINK IT'S SAFE TO TAKE
OFF THE FLASHING LIGHTS?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.645
OH, HANG ON. WAIT TILL
THIS TRUCK PASSES.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.847
- OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD.
- OKAY.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.784
YOU KNOW, I WAS SO FOCUSED
ON GETTING HERE ON TIME

03:36.817 --> 03:38.752
THAT I COMPLETELY
FORGOT TO PUT ON A TIE.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.455
AND BY "PUT ON" I MEAN "BUY."

03:41.489 --> 03:43.691
WELL, I THINK WE CAN
GET YOU A LOANER.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.225
COME HERE.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.828

03:47.861 --> 03:49.830
OH, HERE.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.633
- YEAH, THIS ONE'LL WORK.
- THANKS.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.437
HERE'S A HINT: IT GOES
AROUND YOUR NECK.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.772
I LIVE A RELATIVELY
TIE-FREE LIFE.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.508
COULD YOU SHOW ME HOW
TO DO IT PROPERLY?

04:00.541 --> 04:02.676
OH, A MAN WHO LIKES TO BE
TOLD HOW TO DO SOMETHING?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.545
YOU SHOULD BE STUDIED
BY SCIENTISTS.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.913
I'M HOPING YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.648
WELL, I EXPERIMENTED IN COLLEGE.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.217
- SO SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT.
- OKAY.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.620
HERE WE GO.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.923
SO YOU TAKE THE FAT END...
GOES AROUND THE SKINNY END

04:15.956 --> 04:17.625
TWO TIMES.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.793
THEN YOU BRING IT
UP AND THROUGH.

04:19.827 --> 04:24.432
AND THEN YOU GO BACK DOWN
THROUGH THE RABBIT HOLE.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.233
SEE? I DIDN'T KNOW THERE
WAS A RABBIT HOLE.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.436
AH. ALL RIGHT, THERE.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.638
AH, YOU LOOK VERY DISTINGUISHED.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.673
- SO WE CAN FOOL 'EM.
- ( chuckles )

04:32.706 --> 04:34.908
AHEM, EXCUSE ME.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.910
BURKE, DO YOU THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

04:36.944 --> 04:39.613
FOR THE HOST TO BE DOWN HERE
IN MY ROOM PLAYING DRESS-UP?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.015
BURKE? YOU'RE COUNCILMAN BURKE?

04:42.049 --> 04:44.318
YEP, I'M THE OLD STUFFED SHIRT.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.819
WELL, IN MY CASE STUFFED BRA.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.689
NOT FOR REAL. I MEAN,
IT'S JUST A FUNNY JOKE.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.625
OH, JOE LONGO, THIS IS, UH...

04:51.659 --> 04:54.328
THIS IS, UH... HE
WILL NOW TELL US.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.696
GEORGE KARPELOS JR.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.399
- ALL RIGHT IF I CALL YOU JUNIOR?
- WELL, NOBODY DOES.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.669
WELL, JUNIOR, YOU'RE
WEARING MY FAVORITE TIE.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.737
- OH, I AM SO SORRY.
- NOPE, IT'S OKAY.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.640
- THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA.
- THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.342
I TOLD YOU BEFORE, BURKE...

05:08.376 --> 05:09.743
KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT
OF MY DRAWERS.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.779
ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR
THE IMAGE, LONGO.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.815
HEY, YOU DON'T FOLD A PANCALDI.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.750
YOU ROLL IT, STARTING
WITH THE NARROW END.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.719
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER? YOU
PUT SWEATERS ON HANGERS.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.389
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT SWEATERS ON HANGERS?
- BEATS ME.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.693
( sighs ) NO PUKE ON THE FLOOR.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.796
NO ALCOHOL POISONING. NO
BROKEN GLASS IN MY HAIR.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.297
I MEAN, NOTHING
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.999
BUT SOMEHOW IT WAS
STILL A FUN PARTY.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.435
DID YOU ENJOY YOURSELF?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.637
IT WASN'T ABOUT ENJOYMENT TONIGHT, BURKE.
IT WAS ABOUT BUSINESS.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.606
I MADE $1,500 AND SOME
VERY IMPORTANT CONTACTS.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.775
OH REALLY? MISS BLUE DRESS
WAS AN IMPORTANT CONTACT?

05:41.809 --> 05:43.711
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.
I WASN'T THE ONE

05:43.744 --> 05:46.680
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BASEMENT PLAYING
SPIN THE BABY BOTTLE WITH JUNIOR.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.717
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF BEING
SOME SORT OF CRADLE ROBBER?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.786
BURKE, HE'S STILL GOT THAT LITTLE
SOFT SPOT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.590
- AND YOU'RE, WHAT, 33?
- UH, NOT FOR 275 DAYS.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.793
WHAT? I HAVE A BIRTHDAY
APP ON MY PHONE.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.629
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.931
HE LEFT WITHOUT ASKING FOR MY NUMBER,
SO HE MUST NOT BE INTERESTED.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.967
NAH, JUNIOR JUST PROBABLY HAD
TO RACE HOME BEFORE HIS CURFEW.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.970
( bike bell rings )

06:10.003 --> 06:13.507
HEY. SORRY, I KNOW IT'S
REALLY REALLY LATE,

06:13.541 --> 06:16.043
BUT I GOT HALFWAY HOME AND REALIZED
THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN SOMETHING HERE.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.979
- OH, WHAT DID YOU FORGET?
- TO GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.715
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.817
- IT TURNS OUT I'VE GOT IT RIGHT HERE.
- GREAT.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.855
SO I'LL CALL YOU AND,
UM, WE CAN TALK.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.357
WELL, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.560
OH YEAH. YOU KNOW
HOW I CAN TELL?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.563
- YOUR LIPS ARE MOVING.
- AND SO ARE YOURS.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.398
WE MAY YET HAVE
PUKE ON THE CARPET.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.968
SO WERE YOU IN INDIA
AS PART OF YOUR

06:41.001 --> 06:42.903
SKI-BUM-AROUND-THE-WORLD PHASE?

06:42.936 --> 06:46.406
- NO, THAT WAS ACTUALLY DURING MY RHODES-SCHOLARSHIP PHASE.
- SERIOUSLY?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.408
WHAT, A GUY CAN'T
BE A RHODES SCHOLAR

06:48.442 --> 06:51.545
AND A SKI INSTRUCTOR AND
A RECYCLING ENTHUSIAST?

06:51.579 --> 06:52.846
NO, HE TOTALLY CAN BE.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.749
IT'S JUST HE'S USUALLY NOT
THE GUY TALKING TO ME.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.820
SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

06:59.853 --> 07:02.756
- I WAS IN THAILAND...
- AH, DRUG HOLIDAY?

07:02.790 --> 07:06.527
- PEACE CORPS.
- OF COURSE.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.929
AND I WAS JUST SO UPSET BY
THE TRASH IN THE STREET...

07:08.962 --> 07:10.931
YOU KNOW, THE PLASTIC
BAGS, THE BOTTLES.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.633
IT JUST ATE AWAY AT ME.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.934
OOH, COULD HAVE BEEN PARASITES.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.504
YOU KNOW, ONCE I DRANK THIS
THAI COCKTAIL AND I THOUGHT,

07:16.537 --> 07:18.071
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO EAT THE WORM.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.475
TURNS OUT, NO.

07:21.509 --> 07:26.446
SO I EDUCATED MYSELF ON THE
RECYCLING PROCESS AND... BOOM.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.550
- ECOFLEECE WAS BORN.
- WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.984
I MEAN, YOU'VE HAD
SO MANY ADVENTURES

07:31.018 --> 07:33.453
ALL OVER THE WORLD
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.155
YOU KNOW, THE AGE THAT YOU ARE.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.659
WHATEVER... AGE THAT IS.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.561
YEAH, I GUESS. BUT YOU...

07:40.594 --> 07:42.095
YOU'RE AN ELECTED
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.931
YOU MUST BE THE YOUNGEST
COUNCILWOMAN EVER.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.800
HOW OLD ARE YOU? LIKE 27, 28?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.636
- 20...
- STOP.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.571
NO, SERIOUSLY, STOP.
YEAH, I'M 28.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.448
( bell ringing )

08:01.481 --> 08:04.918
- GOOD MORNING, MR. SHAMTOUB.
- THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.187
DID YOU WAKE UP THIS MORNING
WITH A THROBBING MIGRAINE

08:07.220 --> 08:11.224
- THAT MADE YOU WANT TO RUN INTO TRAFFIC?
- UM, NO.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.461
BUT I'M READY AND EAGER
TO GET GOING ON THE BLOG,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.564
SEEING AS YOU NEED A
NEW EDITOR AND ALL.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.567
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS
THE EDITOR POSITION, MISS SCANLON.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.636
YEAH, BUT I'M THE ONLY
ONE ANYONE LIKES.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.905
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.774
FRANKLY, I DON'T
LIKE ANY OF YOU.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.877
AH, HERE IS THE OTHER CANDIDATE.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.812
ROMAN MAIZES?

08:31.845 --> 08:34.615
MY LITTLE RADICAL PONY, YOU
LOOK EXTRA ANGRY TODAY.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.849
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT YOU.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.586
( mock laughing ) ENOUGH.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.555
LET'S GET DOWN TO
THE NITTY GRITTY.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.624
MAIZES, WHY SHOULD YOU
BE THE NEW EDITOR?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.526
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BRING STANDARDS
BACK TO "THE GRANT RANT"...

08:46.560 --> 08:49.496
- AND RAM THEM DOWN EVERYONE'S THROAT.
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.264
"THE GRANT RANT" SHOULD
BE A PUBLIC FORUM

08:51.298 --> 08:53.533
WHERE ANYONE CAN SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.236
THEN YOU SHOULD BE EDITOR
OF THE BATHROOM WALL.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.838
ZIP IT.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.708
I WANT EACH OF YOU TO SHOW
ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT BLOGWISE.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.710
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS
TO CREATE A SAMPLE.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.045
THAT'S NOT FAIR. ONLY 24 HOURS?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.981
I DID NOT HEAR JACK BAUER
WHIMPERING ABOUT IT.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.150
CLOCK'S RUNNING. TICK TICK.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.789
JACK BAUER WOULD HAVE ALREADY
KILLED THREE PEOPLE.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.259
( knocking at door )

09:19.292 --> 09:21.795
HEY. WELL, LET'S SEE.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.264
UM, IT'S THE GIRL SCOUTS
WHO SELL THE COOKIES,

09:24.297 --> 09:26.233
SO YOU MUST BE SELLING TICKETS

09:26.266 --> 09:29.036
FOR THE SCOUTS' ANNUAL
PANCAKE BREAKFAST.

09:29.069 --> 09:33.573
YEAH. IF I SELL 100 MORE
TICKETS, I WIN A CAP GUN.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.575
- OKAY IF I COME IN?
- YEAH SURE, COME ON IN.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.577
MEL'S NOT HERE THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

09:37.611 --> 09:40.814
BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME OF DAY
WHEN GROWN-UPS ARE AT WORK.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.683
I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO SEE YOU.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.551
MEL SPOKE SO HIGHLY OF
YOUR BUSINESS ACUMEN

09:44.584 --> 09:45.853
WHEN WE HAD DINNER
THE OTHER NIGHT.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.321
SHE SPOKE HIGHLY OF ME?
WHAT, WAS SHE DRINKING?

09:48.355 --> 09:51.191
- OH YEAH... TEQUILA.
- I SEE.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.260
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST HOPING
I CAN GET YOUR INPUT

09:53.293 --> 09:54.828
ON MY RECYCLED
FABRIC BUSINESS...

09:54.862 --> 09:56.697
JUST FINDING
INVESTORS AND STUFF.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.866
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
YOUR BUSINESS PLAN.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.641
CLEARLY YOU'VE PUT A LOT
OF TIME INTO PRESENTATION.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.710
( laughs ) IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

10:09.743 --> 10:11.912
THE RAZZLE-DAZZLE
THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.914
SORRY. ORGANIZATION
ISN'T MY STRONG SUIT,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.949
BUT THE IDEA IS SOLID.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.818
SEE, LOOK.

10:17.851 --> 10:22.222
RECYCLE THE PLASTIC BOTTLES
INTO A LIGHTWEIGHT THREAD.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.291
THAT'S NOT BAD. ORIGINAL PRODUCT.
IT'S CLEAN AND GREEN.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.926
THAT SHOULD ATTRACT
A LOT OF BUYERS.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.896
BUT NOTHING SELLS ANYTHING BETTER
THAN A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING,

10:28.929 --> 10:33.701
NOT EVEN THIS NAPKIN
FROM CHILI'S.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.268
HAD THE WINGS, DID YOU?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.705
OKAY, FACE TO FACE...
I CAN DO THAT.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.673
YEAH? YOU SURE YOU GOT
THE PASSION TO DO THAT?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.875
RENT A CAR, DRIVE AROUND THE
COUNTRY, SHAKE SOME HANDS?

10:41.909 --> 10:45.345
- WELL, UH, I CAN'T DO THAT.
- CAN'T SHAKE HANDS?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.681
WHAT, YOU GOT A GERM THING?

10:47.715 --> 10:50.617
NO NO, I CAN'T RENT A CAR.
I'M ONLY 24.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.387
24? WOW!

10:54.421 --> 10:57.657
( laughs ) THAT IS
REALLY REALLY YOUNG.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.393
DID I JUST SAY WOW?
I MEANT HOLY CRAP.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.330
ALL RIGHT, I'LL FIGURE OUT
THE TRANSPORTATION THING.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.165
BIGGER QUESTION:
HOW DO I WEED OUT

11:05.198 --> 11:07.367
THE BAD LEADS FROM
THE RIGHT CONTACTS?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.670
24... DUDE, YOU'RE
STILL GROWING.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.140
IT'S... I'M SORRY. I JUST NEED
A MINUTE FOR THAT TO SINK IN.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.242
OKAY, I'M GOOD. CAN
I GET YOU A DRINK?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.846
- OKAY. GOT MILK?
- AH, ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT ME.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.148
NO, I'D REALLY LIKE SOME MILK.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.386
WOW! OKAY. MILK COMING RIGHT UP.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.356
YOU WANT THAT IN A SIPPY
CUP OR A BIG BOY CUP?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
- HEY.
- HEY.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.431
SO, UM, INTERESTING NEWS TODAY.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.001
OH, LOOK, THAT WHOLE THING
WAS OVERBLOWN, OKAY?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.370
THE MAYOR WAS JUST GIVING THAT
HITCHHIKER A RIDE WHEN SHE...

11:43.403 --> 11:46.106
WELL, TECHNICALLY HE...
PASSED OUT IN HIS LAP.

11:46.139 --> 11:50.343
- I MEANT NEWS ABOUT YOUR FRIEND JUNIOR.
- GEORGE?

11:50.377 --> 11:53.413
NO, JUNIOR, AS IN SEVERAL
YEARS YOUR JUNIOR.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.415
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW HE'S
A LITTLE YOUNG FOR ME.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.084
HE'S 24, BURKE. HE TOLD ME.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.219
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

11:59.252 --> 12:03.723
- THAT'S A PRETTY BIG AGE GAP.
- WELL, IT'S ONLY FOUR YEARS.

12:03.757 --> 12:07.961
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?
- I TOLD HIM I WAS 28.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.164
- YOU'RE NOT 28.
- AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.934
YEAH... WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT IT.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.735
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ANYWAY?

12:15.769 --> 12:18.772
BECAUSE... I JUST DON'T WANNA
SEE YOU GET HURT, THAT'S ALL.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.975
I MEAN, YOU GUYS ARE AT TOTALLY DIFFERENT
POINTS IN YOUR LIVES, YOU KNOW?

12:22.009 --> 12:24.444
I MEAN, YOU'RE RAISING
KIDS, HE IS A KID.

12:24.477 --> 12:28.448
- HE'S GOT TWO ROOMMATES, YOU'VE GOT TWO FROWN LINES.
- HEY!

12:28.481 --> 12:32.052
I'M JUST SAYING HE PROBABLY
STILL GETS CARDED AT BARS.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.354
WELL, I GET CARDED SOMETIMES.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.357
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
LIKE A PITY CARD.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.962
I HOPE THAT KARAOKE BOWLING
WASN'T TOO SILLY FOR YOU.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.297
NO. ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LOVE THE BOWLIOKE.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.500
I MEAN, I GOT TWO STRIKES AND I HIT THE
HIGH NOTE IN "MY HEART WILL GO ON."

12:47.534 --> 12:50.170
ALMOST HIT IT. YOU WERE
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE.

12:55.208 --> 12:59.112
I GOTTA BE HONEST... I'M FALLING
PRETTY HARD FOR YOU, MEL BURKE.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.454
- GEORGE, LISTEN...
- UH-OH, WAS THAT TOO AGGRESSIVE?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.923
- WAS IT TOO MUCH TONGUE?
- NO NO NO NO NO.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.392
DON'T CHANGE THE TONGUE.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.862
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION INSIDE.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.467
IF THIS IS ABOUT MY BODY
SPRAY, I CAN CHANGE IT.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.935
I GOT A FREE SAMPLE IN THE MAIL.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.237
I'M NOT ATTACHED TO IT AT ALL.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.473
NO NO NO NO NO, YOU'RE FINE,

13:26.506 --> 13:28.842
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
BOLT WHEN YOU HEAR THIS.

13:28.876 --> 13:33.413
UM, I'M NOT EXACTLY 28.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.415
- OH?
- YEP.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.484
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.519
I'M 30.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.223
31. 32.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.458
- DO I HEAR 33?
- NO NO NO, THAT'S IT.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.295
I'M... I'M 32.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.431
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I THINK YOU'RE AWESOME.

13:51.464 --> 13:55.435
- I'M EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN YOU.
- ALSO GOOD AT MATH.

13:55.468 --> 13:59.072
- SO THE AGE DIFFERENCE DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:59.106 --> 14:02.009
IF THIS IS YOU AT 32, I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE YOU AT 40.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.411
I CAN WAIT. I CAN WAIT.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.147
( car horn honks )

14:07.180 --> 14:09.516
OH HEY, THIS IS GREAT.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.451
A FRIEND OF MINE
OWNS A SKI LODGE

14:11.484 --> 14:14.321
AND HE'S WILLING TO LET US IN A
COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE OPENING.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.589
SATURDAY MORNING WE CAN HAVE THE
ENTIRE MOUNTAIN TO OURSELVES.

14:16.623 --> 14:21.094
- IT'LL BE ROMANTIC.
- I WISH I COULD, BUT I GOTTA TAKE RYDER TO A SOCCER GAME.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.030
I PROMISE YOU'LL HAVE FUN.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.498
I'M SURE I WOULD, GEORGE, BUT
I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE
END OF THE SEASON

14:27.034 --> 14:30.103
AND COACH THINKS RYDER MAY
ACTUALLY GET OFF THE BENCH.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.239
I UNDERSTAND. NO PRESSURE.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.441
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SLEEP ON IT

14:34.474 --> 14:37.244
AND I'LL BE BACK HERE FIRST
THING SATURDAY MORNING,

14:37.277 --> 14:40.547
SUITED UP, READY TO DO SOME
BOARDING WITH MY SNOW BUNNY?

14:45.118 --> 14:48.021
I WANNA BE A BUNNY.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.498
( sitar music playing )

14:58.531 --> 15:02.535
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
- MUSIC... A LITTLE SITAR.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.605
OKAY, THIS IS A LITERARY BLOG.
THERE IS NO MUSIC.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.340
UH, A BLOG CAN BE
WHATEVER IT WANTS TO BE.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.210
WELL, THEN LET'S JUST MAKE A
LITTLE SLUMBER PARTY CHAT ROOM.

15:12.545 --> 15:17.150
- WHAT IS THAT MUSIC?
- OH, IT'S A NATIVE PUNJABI FOLK SONG.

15:17.184 --> 15:21.188
AH, THE MUSIC OF MY CHILDHOOD.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.325
I WAS BEATEN. TURN IT OFF.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.495
WHAT BRAZEN AND SLIGHTLY
RACIST ASS-KISSING.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.100
I HAVE READ BOTH OF
YOUR SAMPLE BLOGS.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.103
AND CONGRATULATIONS, LENNOX.
YOU ARE THE NEW EDITOR.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.506
HA! I MEAN NICE TRY.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.675
AND CONGRATULATIONS, ROMAN.
YOU ARE THE NEW EDITOR.

15:42.709 --> 15:46.179
HA! AND I MEAN HA!

15:46.213 --> 15:48.982
WAIT, WHAT? WHICH ONE
OF US IS THE EDITOR?

15:49.016 --> 15:52.185
( laughs ) YES. YOU'RE
BOTH CO-EDITORS.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.022
- BUT I CAN'T WORK WITH HIM.
- YEAH, AND SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.556
( laughing ) AS I WAS HOPING.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.492
I EXPECT LITERARY VIOLENCE.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.263
LET THE BLOG BEATDOWN BEGIN.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.469
WHO'S WINNING... THE BLUE
GUYS OR THE RED GUYS?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.404
OH, THE YOU-COULDN'T-
CARE-LESS GUYS.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.307
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S ABOUT GEORGE.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.576
I'VE BEEN WRESTLING
WITH THIS FOR HOURS

16:16.609 --> 16:19.612
AND IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST
AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN OUR LIVES.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.548
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.483
DO YOU HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

16:23.516 --> 16:26.086
LIKE, WHEN I SAY THOSE EXACT
SAME WORDS, ARE YOUR EARS UNABLE

16:26.119 --> 16:27.620
TO PICK UP THE
FREQUENCY OF MY VOICE?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.623
IF ONLY. NO, IT JUST STRUCK ME.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.260
WELL, I'VE BEEN STRIKING
YOU FOR DAYS, YES!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.128
I'M RAISING TWO KIDS AND
FURTHERING MY CAREER,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.664
AND HE'S STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE WANTS TO BE WHEN HE GROWS UP.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.134
ARE YOU... ARE YOU
KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.136
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I'VE BEEN SAYING TO YOU.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.038
HE WANTS ME TO BE A SNOW
BUNNY, BUT I HAVE TO BE

16:45.072 --> 16:47.307
A RESPONSIBLE GUARDIAN AND
CITY OFFICIAL, YOU KNOW?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.576
WE JUST... WE DON'T HAVE
THE SAME GOALS RIGHT NOW.

16:49.609 --> 16:54.547
- ( doorbell rings )
- THERE'S LIKE A BIG BLONDE ECHO IN HERE.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.084
YES YES. YOU'RE AT TOTALLY
DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR LIVES.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.719
IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DATE
SOMEBODY THAT MUCH YOUNGER THAN YOU.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.521
IT NEVER WORKS OUT,
AND BESIDES THAT,

17:01.554 --> 17:04.057
HONESTLY IT JUST LOOKS WEIRD.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.426
- HEY, JOE!
- HEY! HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW ARE YOU?

17:06.459 --> 17:07.594
MM, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.431
JOE, WHO IS YOUR DELIGHTFUL
YOUNG LADY FRIEND?

17:11.464 --> 17:15.034
- MISS TEEN TOLEDO?
- OH, THIS IS MANDY.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.604
SHE WAS AT THE SMALL BUSINESS
ENTREPRENEURS NIGHT.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.539
OH YES, I REMEMBER YOU.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.675
- BLUE DRESS... BABY BLUE DRESS.
- YEAH.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.445
- I'M A LITTLE EARLY.
- EIGHT YEARS EARLY.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.746
OH... ( laughs )

17:26.779 --> 17:28.781
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.288
HEY, JOE, HAVE YOU SEEN MY
FUNNY HAT WITH THE POM-POMS?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.657
YEAH. I BURNED IT
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.427
WOW, A LITTLE OVERDRESSED FOR
RYDER'S SOCCER GAME, AREN'T YOU?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.629
WHAT IS IT, AN AWAY
GAME IN ANTARCTICA?

17:42.662 --> 17:46.299
RYDER IS CARPOOLING TO
SOCCER WITH JULIO'S MOTHER

17:46.333 --> 17:49.502
AND I AM GOING OUT FOR A ROMANTIC
DAY ON THE SLOPES WITH GEORGE.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.071
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M... I'M SORRY.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.274
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST NIGHT?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.575
LET ME JUST RECAP IT FOR YOU.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.212
I SAID, "MEL, YOU REALLY
NEED TO DUMP GEORGE."

17:59.246 --> 18:02.549
AND YOU SAID, "JOE, YOU MAKE A LOT
OF SENSE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT."

18:02.582 --> 18:04.817
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
ANYTHING I'D EVER SAY.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.620
ARE YOU DOING THIS BECAUSE I
WENT OUT WITH MANDY LAST NIGHT?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.522
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JOE,
EVERY DECISION I MAKE

18:09.556 --> 18:11.424
DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND
WHO YOU BABYSIT.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.094
LOOK, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.099
- YOUR FACE?
- NO.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.834
THIS IS MY FAKE SMILE, OKAY?

18:21.868 --> 18:25.172
I SPEND HOURS AND HOURS EVERY
DAY MAKING THIS BIG FAKE SMILE

18:25.205 --> 18:27.574
WHILE I CLOSE DEALS
FOR THE CITY,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.075
RAISE MONEY FOR THE BOOSTER CLUB

18:29.108 --> 18:31.411
OR CONVINCE PRINCIPALS NOT
TO KICK KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.446
NOW LOOK. DO YOU
KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.684
I WAS JUST GONNA GO WITH YOUR FACE AGAIN.
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.553
THIS IS MY REAL SMILE...
A GENUINE SMILE.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.689
THIS IS WHAT I GET WHEN
I THINK OF GEORGE.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.193
LAST NIGHT I REALIZED I HAD NEARLY
FORGOTTEN WHAT THAT WAS LIKE.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.562
BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT
AGAIN, I DON'T WANNA LOSE IT.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.332
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO BE A
RESPONSIBLE CITY COUNCILWOMAN

18:52.365 --> 18:56.436
AND SOMETIMES I CAN
BE A SNOW BUNNY.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.240
- SO TODAY'S BUNNY DAY?
- HELL YEAH!

19:00.273 --> 19:03.843
- ( bike bell rings )
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW, YOUR PAPERBOY'S HERE.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.613
- HEY THERE.
- HELLO.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.549
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT DRESSED FOR THE SLOPES.
- I KNOW.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.852
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY
ABOUT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.588
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU HAVE TO
TAKE RYDER TO HIS SOCCER GAME,

19:15.622 --> 19:17.790
THEN I'M GONNA GO
WITH YOU BECAUSE

19:17.824 --> 19:20.327
I JUST WANNA BE WITH
YOU, WHEREVER THAT IS.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.463
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?
- OF COURSE.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.665
AND YOU'D DO THIS FOR ME?

19:29.236 --> 19:31.304
( disposal gurgling )

19:33.440 --> 19:35.608
OKAY.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.644
( grinding )

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
- ( grinding stops )
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.350
- YOU LOOK AWFULLY HOT.
- OH YEAH, I'VE GOT A FEW LAYERS ON.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.618
NO, I MEAN YOU LOOK
HOT, AS IN AMAZING.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.687
OH. WELL, THEN I SHOULD
GO TAKE THIS OFF

19:47.720 --> 19:50.590
- BEFORE I OVERHEAT.
- AND I'D BETTER HELP YOU DO THAT.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.460
OH. ( giggles )

19:53.493 --> 19:54.627
WHAT ABOUT RYDER'S SOCCER GAME?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.229
GIVE ME 20 MINUTES.
MAKE SOME SANDWICHES.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.372
AND THAT'S WHEN MIKE
FARADAY CHARGED THE GOAL

20:05.405 --> 20:07.474
AND I WOUND UP WITH
HIS CLEATS IN MY CUP.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.810
- MM, SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUDDY. WHAT WAS THE FINAL SCORE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.212
I WAS IN AND OUT OF
CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL THE PIZZA.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.783
AH, LOOK WHO'S HOME.

20:16.816 --> 20:20.287
- HOW WAS SKIING?
- OH, IT WAS FANTASTIC, EXHILARATING!

20:20.320 --> 20:22.289
I FELT LIKE I WAS
24, WHICH I'M NOT

20:22.322 --> 20:25.592
- AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
- SHE EVEN DID THE BLACK DIAMOND RUN.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.594
OH, I WOULDN'T SAY I DID
THE BLACK DIAMOND RUN

20:27.627 --> 20:29.596
AS MUCH AS I FELL DOWN
THE BLACK DIAMOND RUN.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.997
DO WE HAVE ANY ICE PACKS?

20:32.899 --> 20:36.669
- OH YEAH, CLEATS.
- I'LL GET YOU SOME.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.873
SEE YA, BUDDY.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.344
LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE GLOWING.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.546
YEAH. I THINK I GOT
A LITTLE WINDBURN.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.482
NO, I MEAN YOU
LOOK REALLY HAPPY.

20:49.516 --> 20:53.520
YEAH? WELL, I AM. I
REALLY REALLY AM.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.788
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
I NEED IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.790
- I MADE SOUP. YOU WANT...
- OH, I WOULD LOVE SOME SOUP.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.959
- AND CRACKERS.
- OKAY.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.931
GEORGE, YOU TAKE MY
ADVICE SERIOUSLY, RIGHT?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.566
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.
- GOOD.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.502
LOOK, YOU GOTTA BE ALL
IN ON THIS DEAL, OKAY?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.371
YOU GOTTA BE COMMITTED.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.307
PEOPLE WHO INVEST IN YOU
ARE EXPECTING A RETURN.

21:14.341 --> 21:17.777
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE BUSINESS OR MEL?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.646
ALL OF IT.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.649
WELL, I'M IN IT 100%, JOE.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.950
100%.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.719

21:28.455 --> 21:30.022
- AH, THANKS.
- YEAH.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.291
I'M GONNA HEAD UPSTAIRS
AND TAKE A HOT BATH.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.995
RACE YA.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.567

21:42.635 --> 21:46.639
( instrumental music playing )
