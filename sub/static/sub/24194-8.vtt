BERTRAM GILFOYLE: You wanted
an alternative to Laurie Bream?

Pied Piper Coin.

00:12.797 --> 00:13.797
Mm.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.714
I promised Richard

definitively that we will not.

00:27.714 --> 00:29.047
Have you received my proposal?

00:29.131 --> 00:30.547
Very promising.

00:30.630 --> 00:35.547
Look, Monica, I will do the ICO,
but only if you do it with me.

00:35.797 --> 00:37.881
Pied Piper Coin
is totally gonna work.

00:37.964 --> 00:38.922
Yes! Totally is.

00:54.881 --> 00:56.213
Okay, everybody.

through thick and thin,

unlike K-Hole,

03:18.881 --> 03:23.006
which took their game
and totally bailed on us.

It is slow.

It's a killer new game.

we would launch it
on your network.

05:59.755 --> 06:01.881
It's a sweet indie RPG.

You're gonna have
80,000 instant users.

Yao

09:42.338 --> 09:43.338
This guy.

09:44.338 --> 09:45.547
He's a Chinese manufacturer

09:45.630 --> 09:48.589
who just announced
a partnership with
guess who?

09:48.672 --> 09:49.881
Laurie Bream.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.630
She just led
a $200 million round
for something called YaoNet.

are manufacturing phones,

10:01.380 --> 10:02.547
Oh, shit.

10:02.630 --> 10:04.463
They're not helping us.
They're attacking us.

10:04.547 --> 10:05.672
It's the 51% attack.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.630
Has to be.
I'm sorry, what?

10:07.714 --> 10:08.672
A 51...

10:15.089 --> 10:16.630
A 51% attack...

10:19.213 --> 10:21.714
The beauty of our
decentralized internet

10:21.797 --> 10:23.672
is that no one controls it.

10:23.755 --> 10:27.797
But if 51% were controlled
by one entity,

10:27.881 --> 10:30.172
like, say,
Laurie and Yao,

10:30.255 --> 10:31.755
they could rewrite
the rules for everyone.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.589
They can delete
all of our users,

10:33.672 --> 10:36.380
all of our developer apps,
crash our coin.

10:36.463 --> 10:39.797

Right now, they have
45% of our total.

10:48.630 --> 10:50.172
And gaining.
Wait, Gilfoyle.

10:50.255 --> 10:53.255
Could you write a patch
that kicks all of Yao's
users off the network?

10:53.338 --> 10:55.297
I would have to rewrite
our consensus protocol,

10:55.380 --> 10:57.297
but I could probably
get that done in eight hours.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.505
Okay, that's good.

10:58.589 --> 10:59.755
And-- and how long do we have

10:59.839 --> 11:01.172
till we lose control
of the network?

11:01.255 --> 11:03.714
At this rate,
half that.

11:08.964 --> 11:10.422
I just went for a run.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.213
I sprinted...

11:14.297 --> 11:15.505
up the last bit, there.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.213
I did open palm.

11:20.297 --> 11:21.547
Aaah!

11:21.630 --> 11:23.964
Wh

11:24.047 --> 11:26.672
Richard, there's no
easy way to say this.

11:26.755 --> 11:29.089
Jian-Yang is moving
back into the house.

11:30.463 --> 11:31.755
Right?

11:31.839 --> 11:34.964
Gavin, you've staked
the entire future
of this company

11:35.047 --> 11:37.338
on the Signature Box Three.

11:37.422 --> 11:38.463
Where are they?

11:38.547 --> 11:40.839
Well, the last two months
have been challenging.

11:40.922 --> 11:42.255
The Chinese were petulant.

11:42.338 --> 11:44.463
The North Carolinians
proved very entitled.

11:44.547 --> 11:47.964
And I held out hopes
for our experiment
in the Yukon Territories.

11:48.047 --> 11:49.297
But as it happens,

11:49.380 --> 11:52.338
the Inuit are surprisingly
adept at collective bargaining.

11:52.422 --> 11:53.755
But fear not,

11:53.839 --> 11:56.422
I am in the early
stages of a new plan.

11:56.505 --> 12:01.172
Did you know that some of
America's most capable,
motivated laborers

12:01.255 --> 12:03.422
are at this moment
awaiting execution?

12:03.505 --> 12:04.755
Gavin.

12:04.839 --> 12:07.755
How many boxes have you
actually managed to produce?

12:07.839 --> 12:09.297
Well, we have the 40 prototypes,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.380
which we've been
using to drive sales.

12:11.463 --> 12:13.589
And?
And...

12:14.964 --> 12:16.630
they are very impressive.

12:16.714 --> 12:17.714
I see.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.755
I guess it's time we tell you.

12:20.839 --> 12:22.380
We've been exploring
the viability

12:22.463 --> 12:23.922
of an acquisition with Amazon.

12:24.006 --> 12:25.547
Rachel:
The talks are still
preliminary,

12:25.630 --> 12:27.881
but thus far, they seem
quite promising.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.297
You expect me
to work for Jeff Bezos?

12:30.380 --> 12:31.755
No fucking way.

12:31.839 --> 12:33.338
I mean, don't take this
as any kind of threat,

12:33.422 --> 12:36.422
but if Amazon buys
this company, I am out.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.463
We spoke to Jeff an hour ago.

12:38.547 --> 12:41.922
It sounds like the two of you
are on the same page about that.

12:44.672 --> 12:47.047
Priyanka, start separating
legitimate users

12:47.131 --> 12:48.131
into their own pool.

12:48.213 --> 12:50.338
Becky, I need you to
rate-limit enemy devices.

12:50.422 --> 12:53.547
Danny, find shortcuts to deploy
a new consensus protocol.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.839
Sorry, but we're never
gonna finish in time.

12:55.922 --> 12:57.297
Not with that attitude.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.922
Yeah, we would need
to add a shit ton
more users immediately.

13:00.006 --> 13:03.463
Working on it. Colin, hey.
It's-- it's Richard Hendricks.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.881
Leaving you another voicemail.

13:04.964 --> 13:08.006
Um, just wanted
to talk to you
about your game.

13:08.089 --> 13:12.297
And, uh, those, uh, 80,000
users you got there.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.881
And also, to apologize
for last night.

13:14.964 --> 13:18.338
You know, I was just
really wasted.
I was so drunk.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.006
We had such
a crazy party going on.

13:20.089 --> 13:22.297
Anyway, call me back
and we'll, uh,

13:22.380 --> 13:24.047
we'll chat some
"Gates of Galloo."

13:24.131 --> 13:25.297
We'll, uh, we'll "Galloo" it up.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.547
How's that sound?
Well, just call me back.

13:27.630 --> 13:30.422
Okay? It's-- it's
Richard Hendricks, it's...

13:31.589 --> 13:33.338
Thank you. Bye.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.338
Left another voicemail.
Doesn't really matter.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.463
He's gonna be off the grid
for the next three days.

13:37.547 --> 13:39.589
What?
Yeah, I just spoke
with his girlfriend.

13:39.672 --> 13:41.714
Whatever the fuck you said,
he took really hard.

13:41.797 --> 13:43.714
Colin went camping. Alone.

13:43.797 --> 13:45.630
Well, did she say
where he went?

13:45.714 --> 13:47.297
The Los Trancos Preserve?

13:47.380 --> 13:49.839
Wait. I know exactly
where that is.

13:49.922 --> 13:51.380
I used to go
foraging for mushrooms

13:51.463 --> 13:53.839
with my friend Muriel there
before she passed away.

13:53.922 --> 13:56.131
I could drive up there
and-- and look for him.

13:56.213 --> 13:57.505
It's only 20 miles away

13:57.589 --> 13:59.797
and they don't really
enforce the speed limit.

14:01.089 --> 14:03.131
Fuck your Volt.
I'll drive.

14:04.714 --> 14:06.714
What
I'm borrowing my Tesla.

14:06.797 --> 14:09.047
It's my Tesla.
I pay for it.

14:09.131 --> 14:10.881
And if I don't get
to Colin in time,

14:10.964 --> 14:12.672
Pied Piper ceases to exist.

14:12.755 --> 14:15.630
So, pretty please with
a fucking cherry on top,

14:15.714 --> 14:17.505
can I borrow the Tesla
I bought for you?

14:19.089 --> 14:20.839
Can Jared drive?
No.

14:21.964 --> 14:23.213
Fine.
Thank you.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.047
So...?

14:30.131 --> 14:31.630
So... we're fucked.

14:31.714 --> 14:33.213
No, we're not.
Okay, we just...

14:33.297 --> 14:34.297
We need a few more users

14:34.380 --> 14:36.672
to give Gilfoyle
some breathing room and...

14:36.755 --> 14:38.797
And what if you call
Dana from Quiver?

14:38.881 --> 14:40.547
He hates me.
Everybody does.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.630
And to be honest,
they're right.
I'm an asshole.

14:42.714 --> 14:43.964
No, you're not, Richard.

14:44.047 --> 14:45.213
Yes, I am.

14:45.297 --> 14:47.797
Colin was here last night,
out there in the hallway,

14:47.881 --> 14:48.839
down on his luck

14:48.922 --> 14:51.047
and he was begging me
to take his subscribers.

14:51.131 --> 14:52.672
And I told him to...

14:52.755 --> 14:55.172
kiss... my piss.

14:56.172 --> 14:57.505
You what?
Kiss my piss.

14:57.589 --> 14:59.172
I said it again and again.

14:59.255 --> 15:01.881
Oh my God. I did a dance.

15:03.755 --> 15:07.755
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's just move on
from... this.

15:07.839 --> 15:11.172
I am a spiteful,
vengeful prick.

15:11.255 --> 15:12.672
Oh my God, Richard.

15:12.755 --> 15:13.797
Yes, you fucked up.

15:13.881 --> 15:16.089
But that doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

15:16.172 --> 15:18.672
Look at you,
you're sitting here,
regretting it.

15:18.755 --> 15:20.172
That's not the move
of an asshole.

15:20.255 --> 15:23.338
Okay? I mean, you think
a guy like Gavin Belson
just sits around,

15:23.422 --> 15:25.255
feeling bad about
being a dick to people?

15:25.338 --> 15:26.630
He doesn't even notice, okay?

15:26.714 --> 15:27.839
The guy's a prick
when he was on top

15:27.922 --> 15:29.672
and now after
everything that
just happened,

15:29.755 --> 15:30.755
he's still gonna be a prick.

15:30.839 --> 15:32.630
What do you--
What do you mean?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.255
Everything that just happened.
What happened?

15:34.338 --> 15:37.755
I just read that Amazon's
probably gonna be
acquiring Hooli.

15:37.839 --> 15:38.797
What?

15:38.881 --> 15:40.797
Yeah, so Gavin Belson's
gonna be out on his ass,

15:40.881 --> 15:42.839
but do you think he's gonna
change at all because of it?

15:42.922 --> 15:44.589
No, he's always gonna be a...

15:44.672 --> 15:45.505
prick.

15:45.589 --> 15:47.797
Exactly.
Okay, so stop
whipping yourself

15:47.881 --> 15:50.714
and let's just figure out
what we can do.
He's a prick.

15:50.797 --> 15:51.881
Yes.
Gavin Belson is a prick.

15:51.964 --> 15:53.006
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.714
He's a... he's a total...

15:55.797 --> 15:59.131
fucking prick.
Wait, where
are you going?

15:59.213 --> 16:00.839
Dinesh:
How could it be
this crowded?

16:00.922 --> 16:02.297
Burning Man's
in two weeks,

16:02.380 --> 16:04.839
so people are beta testing
their new gear.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.172
Why would people
who aren't refugees

16:07.255 --> 16:09.630
choose to come here
and live like refugees?

16:09.714 --> 16:11.839
You know that's not,
like, a desirable thing, right?

16:11.922 --> 16:13.672
Living like a refugee? Ugh!

16:13.755 --> 16:16.922
This place is offensive
to homeless people.

16:17.006 --> 16:18.797
Gavin :
Hello?
Hello, Gavin?

16:18.881 --> 16:21.672
It's Richard Hendricks.
Richard Hendricks.

16:23.089 --> 16:24.505
Mind the glass.
Yeah.

16:26.047 --> 16:28.131
Oh. It's all
smashed up again.

16:28.213 --> 16:29.922
What do you want, Richard?

16:31.714 --> 16:32.630
I need your help.

16:32.714 --> 16:33.922
Look, my network
is in trouble.

16:34.006 --> 16:36.172
And I know that deep down,
in your heart, what you...

16:36.255 --> 16:38.047
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You're not gonna give me

16:38.131 --> 16:39.505
another one
of your inspirational,

16:39.589 --> 16:42.006
in defense of
great technology speeches,
are you?

16:42.089 --> 16:43.630
Stand up and
fight for innovation,

16:43.714 --> 16:44.672
that kind of bullshit?

16:44.755 --> 16:47.255
No. Exactly the opposite.

16:47.338 --> 16:50.047
I happen to know
that a man named Yao

16:50.131 --> 16:52.006
fucked you over.

16:52.089 --> 16:53.672
How would you like
to fuck him back?

16:54.672 --> 16:55.797
I'm listening.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.463
I need you to attack me.

16:59.922 --> 17:01.547
Gavin :
John? It's Gavin Belson.

17:01.630 --> 17:03.755
Oh. Hello.

17:03.839 --> 17:06.006
Listen, John.
Do we still
have the prototypes

17:06.089 --> 17:08.006
of my Signature
Box Three strung up?

17:09.172 --> 17:10.338
Yeah.

17:12.338 --> 17:14.755
They told us they
were gonna send more, but...

17:15.755 --> 17:17.047
they never did.

17:17.131 --> 17:18.297
Well, that's a long story.

17:20.463 --> 17:22.672
I got time.
Yeah, listen, John...

17:22.755 --> 17:25.714
I need you
to give admin access
to Richard Hendricks.

17:25.797 --> 17:28.006
Becky, did you run
connection throttling

17:28.089 --> 17:29.881
on the latest batch
of device IDs?

17:29.964 --> 17:31.964
Yes. You know why?

17:32.047 --> 17:33.422
I'm not a moron.

17:33.505 --> 17:35.422
Oh, I see.
I'm the asshole.

17:35.505 --> 17:36.422
Really?

17:36.505 --> 17:37.922
You really wanna
have this conversation?

17:38.006 --> 17:39.547
You're both assholes.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.672
Shut the fuck up.

17:42.922 --> 17:44.589
The fuck does it matter.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.922
We're never gonna finish
this patch in time, anyway.

17:48.881 --> 17:51.213
Wait, what the fuck...

17:51.297 --> 17:52.505
just happened?

17:55.213 --> 17:57.089
Dick, where are you?

17:57.172 --> 17:58.255
I'm at Gavin's.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.755
I just gave his boxes permission

17:59.839 --> 18:01.547
to mimic a shit-ton
of phones on our network.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.047
A second attack.

18:03.131 --> 18:04.338
Richard :
Yes, exactly.

18:04.422 --> 18:07.172
Now Yao can't get to 51%.
Where are we with the patch?

18:07.255 --> 18:09.463
Close, but you do realize

18:09.547 --> 18:11.255
that now that
we're below 51%,

18:11.338 --> 18:13.006
we can't deploy it.

18:13.089 --> 18:14.463
For now, we can't win.

18:14.547 --> 18:17.131
But since Gavin
is holding off Yao,
we can't lose either.

18:17.213 --> 18:19.131
He just bought us some time.

18:19.213 --> 18:21.047
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

18:21.131 --> 18:22.964
Well, Gavin,
thank you very much.

18:23.047 --> 18:26.047
You just gave me
and my guys
a fighting chance.

18:26.131 --> 18:27.797
Is that what just
happened here, Richard?

18:27.881 --> 18:29.047
Yes.

18:30.047 --> 18:31.505
No?
Seems to me,

18:31.589 --> 18:34.047
you are the one
that just gave me
a fighting chance.

18:35.213 --> 18:36.380
Ni hao.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.547
It's Gavin Belson
for Mr. Yao.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.422
What the fuck are you doing?

18:41.505 --> 18:43.881
Jared:
This is the last road, Dinesh.

18:43.964 --> 18:45.089
He's not here.

18:47.922 --> 18:51.422
Colin! Colin!

18:51.505 --> 18:52.797
Will you shut the fuck up?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.839
How would you like to
die today, motherfucker?

18:54.922 --> 18:56.505
No, it's not a real
death threat, sir.

18:56.589 --> 18:58.839
Jared: I'm sorry.
I'm just stressed.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.505
Shut up for a second.
You hear that?

19:00.589 --> 19:02.380
(gunfire and screaming
continue)

19:07.089 --> 19:08.755
(gunfire and screaming
continues)

19:15.505 --> 19:18.505
So, you want us to delete
all of our phones?

19:18.589 --> 19:20.297
Right now,
we're in a standoff.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.672
You can't win,
but if you back off, I can.

19:23.755 --> 19:25.338
I have more
devices than anyone,

19:25.422 --> 19:26.839
I will reach 51%,

19:26.922 --> 19:28.630
and take control of
this little shit's network.

19:28.714 --> 19:30.006
You know,
can I chime in here?

19:30.089 --> 19:34.463
I actually think that
this is a bad idea, and...

19:34.547 --> 19:36.881
In exchange for deleting
your principal competition,

19:36.964 --> 19:38.714
I'm simply asking
for a partnership

19:38.797 --> 19:40.338
between your venture
and Hooli.

19:40.422 --> 19:42.505
Well, he's actually

the connection could--

19:44.255 --> 19:45.714
for fuck's sake.

19:45.797 --> 19:47.672
I'm sure my board would find

19:47.755 --> 19:50.213
an arrangement
between YaoNet and Hooli

19:50.297 --> 19:52.213
vastly preferable
to fire sale-ing

19:52.297 --> 19:53.964

19:54.047 --> 19:55.380
My proposal is I help you,

19:55.463 --> 19:57.755
in exchange for a 20% stake
in your venture.

19:57.839 --> 19:59.255
And I have
a counterproposal,

19:59.338 --> 20:03.338
that you do not do that.

20:03.422 --> 20:04.630
Gavin...

20:05.964 --> 20:07.297
How do we proceed?

20:08.755 --> 20:09.797

Gavin is fucking us.

You're not wrecking mine.

limits performance

Hey, Richard.
I know what might

very carefully

about the next words
that come out of your mouth.

23:14.839 --> 23:15.797
Oh, shit.

No, not yet.
Hold on a moment.

I thought you'd
wanna see it happen.

Wait.

Take what?

23:54.297 --> 23:55.922
Pied Piper.

23:56.006 --> 23:57.463

23:57.547 --> 24:00.213
Just please don't destroy it.

24:00.297 --> 24:02.047
I'd rather give it away
than watch it die.

24:03.338 --> 24:05.797
As much as I hate to admit,

24:05.881 --> 24:09.131
who better to take it
than you, Gavin?

24:09.213 --> 24:12.547
I mean, you're
really the only one

24:12.630 --> 24:15.755
who realizes what
the decentralized internet
could be.

24:15.839 --> 24:18.505
I find this uninteresting.
Can we proceed?

24:18.589 --> 24:20.463
You wrote the patent
and gave it to me.

24:20.547 --> 24:24.463
Hell, you hired
the best 63 distributed
systems engineers in the city.

24:24.547 --> 24:28.755
I mean, you could build this
into what it was meant to be.

24:28.839 --> 24:29.797
Gavin, enough.

24:29.881 --> 24:32.338
Come on, you know
that my network

24:32.422 --> 24:34.797
is way better than
some knockoff.

24:34.881 --> 24:37.505
And instead of taking
a minority stake
in their company,

24:37.589 --> 24:39.422
you could take
total control of mine.

24:40.714 --> 24:41.672
Why would you turn that down?

24:41.755 --> 24:44.255
Let's make it official.
I will, uh...

24:45.922 --> 24:50.131
I will sign my company
over to you.

24:50.213 --> 24:51.922
It's yours, Gavin. You win.

24:53.922 --> 24:55.006
Okay?

24:55.089 --> 24:57.672
Take it.
Just please don't delete it.

24:57.755 --> 24:59.172
All our phones
are turned off, now.

24:59.255 --> 25:02.797

Pied Piper immediately

25:03.755 --> 25:05.255
Not if I walk away first.

Mr. Hendricks here

25:24.630 --> 25:26.338
