00:14.120 --> 00:19.720
<i>Aethelflaed, the Lady of Mercia,</i>
<i>has died and I am bereft.</i>

00:20.640 --> 00:23.240
<i>Aethelhelm has sought to install</i>
<i>his grandson,</i>

00:23.320 --> 00:25.560
<i>Aelfweard, on the Mercian throne.</i>

00:25.640 --> 00:27.680
<i>But Edward was ruthless…</i>

00:28.240 --> 00:29.800
Did you see the ealdormen?

00:29.880 --> 00:31.640
I did. They are dead.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.160
I will do as God wills.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.880
I will be king of the Angles
and of the Saxons.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.400
<i>Aelswith,</i>
<i>fearing for her granddaughter's safety,</i>

00:40.480 --> 00:43.080
<i>took Aelfwynn and fled Mercia.</i>

00:44.480 --> 00:48.280
<i>The distraught Brida</i>
<i>has taken Father Pyrlig prisoner,</i>

00:48.360 --> 00:50.840
<i>but his kindness has eased her pain.</i>

00:50.920 --> 00:52.760
Your daughter is at peace now.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.360
Maybe in finding peace of your own,
you might repent.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.480
<i>Aelflaed has become enthralled</i>
<i>by the visionary, Aalys.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:03.480
Travel with us and do not tell them.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.960
It is a holy tribute.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.920
<i>While her father Aethelhelm,</i>
<i>thwarted by Edward once again,</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:13.880
<i>must find new ways to exert his influence.</i>

01:13.960 --> 01:18.520
This is not the way
succession is determined!

01:18.600 --> 01:20.040
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:23.840 --> 01:28.240
You murderer!
You killed my husband!

01:28.320 --> 01:32.200
- You killed our ealdormen!
- Oi! Get back here!

01:32.280 --> 01:34.720
- You killed them all!
- Ignore threats. Maintain your dignity.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.600
Do not rise to provocation.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.840
What news do you bring?
Has Eoferwic located Pyrlig?

01:40.920 --> 01:42.760
No news of Father Pyrlig, Lord King.

01:42.840 --> 01:47.320
But I imagine Sigtryggr will be unsettled
by the news from here.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.760
Yes.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.840
Perhaps we should make overtures
to reassure them. Scotland too.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.280
Let King Constantin know
we are minded to renew the alliance.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.760
My Lord, I do not serve you.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.760
I am here only to say my farewells.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.200
Whilst I understand your reasons,
I cannot be a part of this.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.520
Oh, how virtuous.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.680
Aelfwynn would have presided
over a civil war.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.000
I loved my sister. I do not dishonor her.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.560
You simply do what is best for Mercia.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.200
Should I have shown more mercy?

02:28.040 --> 02:29.040
Was there another path?

02:31.320 --> 02:33.480
A kingdom is never made without bloodshed.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.760
But it does not need to be ruled by fear.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.360
Show the world that you are just
and that you live by the faith.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.160
As a sign of our wish to atone

02:47.520 --> 02:50.040
and reconcile with the sons of Mercia,

02:51.720 --> 02:55.240
we offer our fast
until the masses are completed.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.040
Accept these offerings
from our table.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.240
Feast here as our guests,
even as we refrain.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.280
It is my hope
we put this turbulence behind us.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.160
Do you think he's sincere?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.960
I can no longer read his mood.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.320
I feel just sickened
with it all.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.600
The brutality,
the way he dishonors Mother.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.560
It's because
you are a fine and true young man

03:20.640 --> 03:22.360
who, one day, will be a mighty king.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.600
If this is so, then why…

03:28.360 --> 03:30.080
Why does he not name me the aetheling?

03:30.160 --> 03:33.600
Some men cannot think of their own demise.
It frightens them.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.960
But with your permission,
I will find a way to resolve this.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.800
I need to be certain
that nothing can be traced back to me.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.320
The men can bear none of my insignia.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.640
Yes, I understand and they will say
they are from King Sigtryggr.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.280
I know what I'm doing.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.560
You do realize this could start a war
between Christian and Dane?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.280
Hopefully, yes.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.080
Ideally,
the King falls in battle

04:04.160 --> 04:08.360
and Aelfweard inherits a land
free of the heathen curse.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.480
Time is running out for my bloodline.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.520
Could you not wield influence
another way?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.440
Build a few minsters or declare a miracle?

04:19.520 --> 04:22.000
How charmingly old-fashioned, Bresal.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.120
No, like the King,

04:25.200 --> 04:29.440
I have learned nothing is
as effective as the stench of death.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.680
Do not worry.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.960
When we have delivered the tapestry,
you may return home from the Holy Isle.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.240
With God's speed, the King
may never learn that I have been away.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.800
The light is fading.
We shall be forced to sleep under trees.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.240
You must regret
traveling with simple folk.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.000
You are not simple folk.
You are a gift from the Lord.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.560
The life of a queen
can be somewhat lonely.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.320
Please…

05:02.560 --> 05:04.840
Be careful.
It could be a trick for thieves.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.080
- Stand back until they are gone.
- Lady, please.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.280
- Have pity.
- We must help this traveler, my lady.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.200
Do not be softhearted. Stay.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.920
He is a soul in need.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.440
What happened here with you…

05:21.320 --> 05:23.680
Which one of these
is the farm girl from Lewes?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.120
I am the visionary.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.000
A visionary,
but you did not see us coming.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.000
Whose men are you?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.520
We were sent by King Sigtryggr.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.320
All of Mercia's ealdormen?
All of them?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.800
Slaughtered, yes.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.640
With his sister not yet cold.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.200
She must have restrained Edward
more than we knew.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.440
I fear we could be next,
that he will come to conquer.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.720
Take a band to the border
and double the patrol.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.040
- Send a warning to the King himself.
- Yes.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.960
Dispatch a warrior
to speak this in my name,

06:03.800 --> 06:08.000
"If he chooses to come north,
we will be ready."

06:18.680 --> 06:20.000
We are restored!

06:21.240 --> 06:23.280
Remove the Saxon sign!

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
Burnstone.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.480
Very pretty.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.760
Someone will buy it.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.720
Lord Haesten, Lord Haesten!

06:59.000 --> 06:59.960
You must see this.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.080
Jesus, please…

07:34.840 --> 07:35.680
Who did this?

07:39.160 --> 07:41.520
They were sent from the King of Jorvik.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.600
They said Sigtryggr wanted vengeance.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.360
They spared me to spread the word.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.480
Are you pilgrims?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.480
Travelers with the dead queen.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.520
Take the body down
and clear all traces of this.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.440
Now!

09:13.680 --> 09:17.280


09:18.320 --> 09:19.760
How many return to us?

09:20.440 --> 09:21.280
How many?

09:22.080 --> 09:25.320
- Warn the alehouse! Osferth's thirsty!

09:31.520 --> 09:34.080
Aethelstan, go straight to the boatman.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.800
Get something fast.
We can sail at high tide.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.240
You're still alive.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.720
Just.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.760
Just is enough.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.160
What of Stiorra and her husband?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.920
They are restored

10:00.840 --> 10:01.680
just.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.160
But

10:06.320 --> 10:07.600
Lady Aethelflaed…

10:09.240 --> 10:10.880
She has been taken from us.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.960
That is a cruelty, Father.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.040
But she's at peace.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.520
It is of some comfort.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.680
There has been much cruelty.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.200
Have you…

10:35.040 --> 10:36.000
Um…

10:37.640 --> 10:39.960
- Have you walked at all?
- A little.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.840
Many things are difficult, but

10:45.320 --> 10:46.880
my body is strong.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.560
- And my heart--
- Will be avenged.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.560
Brida lives.
We fear she has Father Pyrlig.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.760
At high tide, we take a boat to track her.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.560
- With that you could come…
- The Lord is not calling me to revenge.

11:03.000 --> 11:03.960
No.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
Of course.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.520
To kill her might be my destiny alone.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.800
Perhaps it's not your destiny.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.680
You have a good life here, Father.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.240
Now that Lady Aethelflaed is departed,

11:21.560 --> 11:22.840
you could find a wife,

11:23.800 --> 11:25.120
have more children.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.120
One son lost as a babe.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.880
One now lying injured.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.040
A daughter who fought alone for her life.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.120
I would not curse another child
with me as a father.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.360
What of the son who was hidden,
who does not know his father?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.760
You do not know that.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.400
It is not safe for you to know that.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.840
His time will come.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.560
Besides…

12:01.880 --> 12:02.840
Aethelflaed

12:04.560 --> 12:06.120
is not departed.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.040
She, uh…

12:08.840 --> 12:09.960
She's with me still.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.960
Then we both must walk
with wounds that will not heal.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.880
Here. This way.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.440
We are not here to be seen.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.160
Where is our boat?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.560
- Where is the sea?
- There is no sea.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.880
Girl, you have no sense.
I have changed the plan.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.880
- In here…
- What is happening?

12:35.440 --> 12:38.720
- Is someone planning on having me killed?
- No, child.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.840
Someone is planning on giving you life.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.760
What?

12:43.640 --> 12:47.080
I will not have you living in the shadows,
waiting for some assassin.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.040
My mother bore that danger every day.

12:49.120 --> 12:53.040
Yes and living the way she did
put a poison in her flesh

12:53.120 --> 12:55.200
and robbed me of my most cherished gift.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.320
What is your plan for me?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.200
I have chosen you a husband.

13:03.000 --> 13:03.880
Someone you know.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.800
I will explain.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.920
I have been asked to convey a message
of great seriousness and secrecy.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.120
The Lady Aelswith has noted
your affection for her granddaughter

13:24.200 --> 13:27.160
and asks that you convey yourself
to Buccstan for Sunday.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.920
There you will meet
with Lady Aelfwynn and marry her.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.920
Why have I been selected
for this alliance?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.040
Because you're a nobody.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.080
If Aelfwynn marries you,
no ealdorman can force her hand.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.120
Then I will be honored
to preserve the safety of the princess.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.720
Osferth.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.680
The great warrior Haesten, a man of trade.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.760
I had heard of this,
but I did not believe it.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.320
A trader and owner of 30 ships.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.920
You should see my settlement, Uhtred.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.440
Twice the size of this one,
fertile farms and fat women.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.360
Not like this…

14:42.200 --> 14:43.280
only fit for…

14:45.000 --> 14:45.920
pigs.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.840
You have plenty of insults for a man
who can no longer wield a sword.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.480
I can wield it, Uhtred.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.640
I think you should go.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.160
No.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.040
We must speak, somewhere out of sight.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.880
- There's nothing I want from you.
- Believe me, Uhtred.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.000
We must speak.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.720
Where's this visionary now?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.360
I placed her with my kin.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.360
To trade her?

15:34.440 --> 15:35.600
To keep her safe.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.440
War will come from this.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.920
Why would Sigtryggr do
something so stupid?

15:40.000 --> 15:40.840
He has not.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.920
It's not his command.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.040
His brother, then? Or Brida?

15:46.640 --> 15:49.240
Perhaps Mercians,
seeking revenge.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.480
There's quite a few who hate Edward now.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.680
This is a bad omen, Lord, for all of us.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.360
I fear this death
will only deliver more death.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.720
Why did you bring me this?

16:01.800 --> 16:04.360
We both have interest
in keeping the peace, Uhtred.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.920
Me to trade and you, well…

16:08.640 --> 16:13.080
I cannot think Edward will spare
your daughter when he retaliates.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.120
We must make Sigtryggr denounce this act.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.600
Finan, Osferth, remain here.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.040
You must guard
the Queen's body with all honor.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.640
Sihtric, Aethelstan,
go to Aegelesburg, both of you.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.480
If they hear of this,
come north to warn me.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.560
No, we cannot hide news
of the Queen's slaughter. It's wrong.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.080
She has a son who should know, a father.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.440
Aethelhelm will want revenge.
He will blame all Daneland for this.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.080
You will not have to hide it for long.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.840
I will be swift and then I will bring
the Queen's body to Aegelesburg myself.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.280
Haesten, come with me to Eoferwic.
Tell them what you've heard.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.120
- Let me come to Eoferwic.
- Aethelstan!

16:49.200 --> 16:53.200
- Let him. I will have no part in this.
- You are already a part of it. We all are.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.480
If they hear
this story of Sigtryggr killing a queen,

16:55.560 --> 16:58.120
there will be a slaughter
beyond Brida at her worst.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.480
Does that not get heavy?

17:11.839 --> 17:13.960
You do not have to hold your sword.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.520
You're stronger than me.
The sword makes us equal.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.520
How far are we going?

17:31.079 --> 17:32.359
This is where the journey ends.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.280
Head south,
eventually you'll reach Winchester.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.520
Hear me on this.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.400
Edward does not want battle
with Daneland or with Danes.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.360
Come with me
to Winchester and seek a peace.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.360
They will execute me
before I'm within the gates.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.160
I will stand for you.
You will be under my protection.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.960
The war should end, Brida.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.000
The war you started

17:57.840 --> 17:59.120
and the war within you.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.560
Good luck with the wolves.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.360
Father Pyrlig?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.840
I accept your offer
of safe passage and protection.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.480
Take me to Uhtred.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.720
But my offer was to Edward.
He is the king.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.160
But Uhtred is the enemy
with whom I must reconcile.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.880
If I am to come to peace, he's the one.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.400
What? I thought you believed
I was ready for redemption.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.480
We've had no word
of the Visionary's demise.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.920
Word of this should be spreading!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.920
The bodies will be found.
They were left hanging near an open road.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
If this has gone wrong--

18:53.080 --> 18:55.000
You'll do what?
Send an assassin to kill me?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.320
What's Aethelstan doing here?

19:01.760 --> 19:03.200
The King must've summoned him.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.680
Someone is ahead of me.
They're trying to make use of this moment.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.480
- And the whereabouts of Lady Aelswith?
- Still making inquiries.

19:09.560 --> 19:14.480
We must locate her and the Lady Aelfwynn
in case there is a plot forming.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.120
Do not start changing the plan.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.680
In a fight to the death,
a man must be nimble.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.720
I jump to escape being pushed.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.120
We will be noticed.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.560
- Sihtric. We will be found.
- Not if you stay quiet.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.960
Learn to move by stealth.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.840
Lord King, a moment?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.720
We are leaving
to visit some of my new estates.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.760
It cannot wait, Lord King.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.680
An atrocity has occurred
against the faith.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.120
Big ride for a small woman.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.400
It belongs to my husband.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.840
Traveling light?

20:01.160 --> 20:02.040
Empty-handed…

20:06.240 --> 20:07.920
I do not know who you are

20:08.760 --> 20:10.880
and I do not need your money.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.560
Did the family reward you, then?

20:13.480 --> 20:16.080
Show gratitude for all you did?

20:20.280 --> 20:23.960
Where are they,
Ladies Aelfwynn and Aelswith?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.160
Where have they gone?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.680
I do not owe you an answer.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.760
People are

20:30.440 --> 20:34.200
concerned for Lady Aelfwynn's safety.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.440
So, if you remember where they are…

20:42.280 --> 20:43.200
…find me.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.040
- I want the horse I paid for. Go.
- All right.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.400
- I need to leave Aegelesburg tonight.
- That man is looking for Aelfwynn.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.440
That one.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.160
That is not good.
Is he the King's man?

20:58.240 --> 20:59.280
I do not know.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.680
Do you know where they went?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.280
- You do not have to tell me the place--
- Yes, I do.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.000
I will travel there to warn them
that they are being tracked

21:11.320 --> 21:13.840
if you stay to keep one eye on the King.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.440
Little Aalys

21:22.480 --> 21:28.160
slaughtered as she carried the tapestry
on its sacred journey.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.320
Hung from a tree
like a piece of rotten meat.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
The visionary.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.160
A symbol of your common people, murdered.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.360
Let us join together now

21:44.440 --> 21:48.840
to confront this Dane threat
before Sigtryggr

21:48.920 --> 21:52.440
and his brother unite to slaughter us all!

21:55.680 --> 21:57.160
Where did you hear this news?

22:03.000 --> 22:07.840
You know I have friends in every town,
but I urge you, Lord King,

22:07.920 --> 22:09.560
you cannot delay a response.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.200
Fury must be met with fury.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.200
Or the common people
will act on your behalf.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.280
I would like to have this
properly confirmed.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.320
You choose now to act with caution?

22:27.400 --> 22:30.040
When you have shown such boldness of late?

22:30.120 --> 22:33.880
The pilgrims may be resting peacefully
in Lindisfarne as we speak.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.280
Or killers maraud your lands
without consequence--

22:37.360 --> 22:38.240
Perhaps!

22:39.560 --> 22:42.320
But I will not be moved
to retaliate until I am certain.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.480
Is there truth in it?

22:54.560 --> 22:55.800
I can make inquiries.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.120
If he is correct,
it will indeed cause dismay.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.400
And great division
between Christian and Dane.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.920
I've observed
you have not yet left Mercia.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.800
I hope I have reassured you
I'm not wholly impulsive.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.040
I need men here I can trust.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.880
Stay here and watch Aethelhelm.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.760
If he has heard this much,
he's going to hear much worse.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.840


23:40.080 --> 23:41.720
I am insulted.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.200
Let me assure you,
if I were attacking Wessex,

23:50.280 --> 23:52.320
I would do more than strangle a queen.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.360
To be fair, Uhtred said this.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.880
Who do you think is responsible?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.360
- Who acts in your name?
- No one.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.000
This is the work of Edward himself.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.000
He hated the Queen, and he hates us.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.000
He has killed her to justify a war.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.520
He does not want a battle.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.520
But when he hears of this,
he will have to retaliate.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.800
Which is why we have sent men
to our border.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.600
I will go to him with your denial.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.440
Though were you to journey with me,
this matter could be settled easily.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.640
And leave Eoferwic undefended once again?

24:25.920 --> 24:27.560
I have given my word.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.720
That is enough.

24:34.160 --> 24:36.520
He suffers from his allies deserting him.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.840
I did not desert you.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.400
I have men this moment
preparing to track Brida--

24:42.480 --> 24:43.960
Yet we sit alone in Eoferwic.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.680
I'm trying to save you
from a battle you will not win!

24:47.880 --> 24:50.680
Edward has twice the sliver,
twice the armies.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.200
Now he has Mercia--

24:52.280 --> 24:55.440
I am not afraid of a man
who cannot even protect his own wife.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.240
Take me to the visionary.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.760
I must find out who spread these lies.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.840


25:15.920 --> 25:17.240
There's a rider!

25:18.720 --> 25:20.000
Out of the way, men!

25:20.480 --> 25:21.320
What approaches?

25:21.400 --> 25:23.680
They say
a messenger from the Danes.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.800
- What is the word of Sigtryggr?
- A declaration.

25:31.880 --> 25:37.040
"If King Edward chooses to come north,
we will be ready."

25:41.880 --> 25:44.840
Sigtryggr has, in essence, called for war.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.640
No, he has warned us not to approach.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.800
- It is different.
- I do not understand this reluctance.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.840
Aethelstan?

25:53.720 --> 25:54.720
Is Uhtred with you?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.240
No, he is visiting his daughter.

25:58.120 --> 26:03.080
Now your greatest warrior has abandoned
his post at Rumcofa to join Sigtryggr!

26:03.160 --> 26:05.120
Lord Uhtred is a man of honor!

26:05.200 --> 26:08.160
He goes only to see his child,
so do not inflame the matter.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.640
Be wiser.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.920
Please, Lord Aethelhelm.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.240
Rather than press for battle,
I would ask you take a gift to the Scots.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.440
They will be nervous of trouble
on their border.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.360
Then, if that is your order,

26:37.720 --> 26:40.200
I shall gladly leave Aegelesburg.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.280
You speak your mind.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.640
I heard you were quite the fighter.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.600
I need a loyal man
to lead the Mercian Guard.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.800
Live here alongside them
and be my presence here in Aegelesburg.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.360
Perhaps that man could be you
in recompense for--

27:07.440 --> 27:08.480
My banishment?

27:09.640 --> 27:12.480
There are worse fates
than to be raised by Uhtred.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.920
It'll be a better use of your talent
than spying on your father.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.720
I should like to accept.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.600
Do you want my oath?

27:35.240 --> 27:36.120
Do I need it?

27:37.440 --> 27:41.040
If I cannot trust my son, who can I trust?

27:43.200 --> 27:44.680
I'm not sure this is wise.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.920
If Edward cannot be provoked,
perhaps Sigtryggr can.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.480
He's clearly anticipating an attack,
so let's give the heathen what he wants.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.520
Come and meet my men.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.560
They are common folk.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.640
You'll like them.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.400


28:07.360 --> 28:10.080
Ignore it. Go to sleep.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.080
I cannot.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.560
I have too much to consider.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.560
What day will he come for us?

28:17.920 --> 28:23.040
I have said Sunday.
So, now we must be patient.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.080
What is it like to be married?

28:31.200 --> 28:35.480
When one is married to the right person,

28:36.600 --> 28:39.520
it is the greatest gift
the Lord can bestow.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.320
The passions of the flesh

28:44.000 --> 28:48.640
when enacted within loving matrimony
are transporting.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.960
When one feels the tremors
of male affection--

28:55.040 --> 28:58.200
- Grandmother.
- It is but an honest answer.

29:00.120 --> 29:04.320
It is why Alfred and I
had such beautiful children.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.560
What if one is married
to the wrong person?

29:08.640 --> 29:09.880
I hardly know Cynlaef.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.680
I hardly knew Alfred.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.120
It is the way of things.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.280
With the wrong person

29:19.960 --> 29:22.720
I'm told marriage is a living hell.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.720
Nonetheless, the bond holds fast.

29:34.400 --> 29:38.520
It grieves me to be
the bearer of such news.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.560
I know how much
the visionary meant to you all.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.080
And to think of that child strangled,

29:53.400 --> 29:56.400
defiled, her body hung from a tree!

29:58.240 --> 29:59.080
It's unbearable.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.960
My man Bresal here…

30:03.960 --> 30:08.040
informs me that
the Dane assassins who killed her

30:08.120 --> 30:13.200
now disguise themselves in godless Rumcofa

30:13.280 --> 30:15.840
among the heathen settlers there.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.160
I cannot be seen

30:21.560 --> 30:24.400
to go against my King's command.

30:25.400 --> 30:31.480
But if any of you wishes to avenge this,

30:33.160 --> 30:39.120
there will be warm fires
to welcome you in my camp.

30:41.280 --> 30:46.880
For too long we have let
the Dane threat live alongside us,

30:47.440 --> 30:54.000
welcomed them into our homes,
our food in their mouths

30:55.360 --> 30:58.240
while they plot bloody outrage!

30:58.320 --> 31:04.520
Any man who wishes
to avenge themselves is free to go

31:04.600 --> 31:09.760
to seek the justice your King should seek!

31:10.800 --> 31:13.280
- Whose men are you?
- We come from the King.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.320
Dane murderers are hiding here
and you must hand them over.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.200
Of course, my men will attend to it.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.600
Bresal, no Dane here would kill
Queen Aelflaed. They are good people.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.880
Why do you speak of Queen Aelflaed?

31:41.840 --> 31:42.960
Cynlaef!

31:43.040 --> 31:44.560
Get your arse out here!

31:46.520 --> 31:48.000
- No Cynlaef?
- No, why?

31:48.080 --> 31:48.960
What's wrong?

31:49.600 --> 31:52.000
I need someone to alert the men downriver.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.760
But quietly, so it doesn't look like
we want a fight. Soldiers have arrived.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.560
They say they're from Edward,
but I'm not sure I believe it.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.360
- I'll go.
- No!

32:00.440 --> 32:02.200
I can raise the men of Rumcofa.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.680
They know me,
and no one will notice me leave.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.000
Do that.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.640
Send them up and wait downriver
until I say it's safe to return here.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.320
Swear it.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.760
I swear. Go.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.640
What are you doing?
These are innocent folk!

32:37.720 --> 32:38.640
Get your hands off her!

32:40.960 --> 32:42.440
Tell your men to stand down!

32:44.440 --> 32:45.480
Who are you?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.760
Finan! These men have been here before!

32:49.840 --> 32:52.920
Danes of Rumcofa have murdered our Queen!

32:53.000 --> 32:55.680
Queen killers!
Dane-loving scum!

32:55.760 --> 32:59.080
Do your duty
and rid the cockles from the wheat!

33:04.840 --> 33:05.680
Stop it!

33:06.360 --> 33:08.400
Danes here! Christian there!

33:09.280 --> 33:10.480
Separate them.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.200
Dane! Saxon!

33:36.920 --> 33:39.600
Danes in here, go! Come on!

33:39.680 --> 33:41.520
Father, declare a sanctuary! Go!

33:45.240 --> 33:46.400
You'll be safe in here.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.480
Bresal, they are good people--

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
Get off me!

34:38.360 --> 34:41.480
Osferth, Cynlaef! This way!
We must get Ingrith!

34:44.120 --> 34:46.360
Check the docks!

34:48.280 --> 34:49.120
Come with me!

34:53.239 --> 34:54.560
Ingrith!

35:00.159 --> 35:01.840
Get out of my way!

35:04.520 --> 35:05.680
Ingrith!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.120
- Ingrith, go!
- Come on!

35:10.800 --> 35:11.760
Fight me, boy!

35:26.160 --> 35:27.000
Ingrith!

35:35.080 --> 35:36.040
Ingrith!

35:47.200 --> 35:49.080
- No!
- No!

35:51.280 --> 35:53.640
You're all right!
You're all right. Hey, hey!

35:54.720 --> 35:55.600
It's all right.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.720
- Help!
- Where's the wound?

35:58.800 --> 36:01.000
- Where is it?

36:04.320 --> 36:07.680
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!

36:10.600 --> 36:14.160
- It's all right.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.400
Don't let me die, Finan!

36:16.480 --> 36:22.960
- Shh, I'm here with you.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.920
Do not be afraid, Aalys.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.200
Uhtred is no danger.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.720
He seeks only to make this right.

37:04.920 --> 37:08.920
I swear I mean you no harm.
I come only to hear your story.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.360
The men that attacked the Queen…

37:26.280 --> 37:28.640
they claimed to come from Sigtryggr, yes?

37:33.400 --> 37:35.360
How did they know where to find her?

37:38.440 --> 37:40.640
We told no one the Queen rode with us.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.400
Her menfolk would have forbidden it.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.160
Did they say why they wanted the Queen?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.440
They did not want her.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.360
They came for me.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.480
They did. They spoke my name.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.680
But the Lord guided her.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.520
She stood for me,
claimed my place in the slaughter.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.600
I wanted only to see the Holy Isle.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.960
Why did St. Cuthbert lead me…

38:16.360 --> 38:17.760
…then let this happen?

38:48.240 --> 38:49.080
I've got him.

39:01.760 --> 39:02.960
I'm sorry.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.480
It's my fault!

39:08.360 --> 39:09.600
It's all my fault.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.440
<i>Pater noster qui es in caelis…</i>

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
Do not do that.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.240
Danes, they have other customs.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.800
Take the survivors to Danelaw.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.600
Mercia is no place for us.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.040
We will take Osferth back
to the place of his birth.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.280
Let him rest in Wessex.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.080
Take Finan with you to meet Uhtred.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.960
I will meet Sihtric
on the road to Aegelesburg.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.400
Take Aalys to Lindisfarne.
I have a friend there who will hide her.

40:12.880 --> 40:16.000
Killing a Queen, I follow.
But who would want to kill a farm girl?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.000
Someone who wishes to stir the people.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.640
Brida?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.080
It is too sly for her.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.800
Whichever, I ride to tell the King.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.040
He can perhaps be restrained
if he knows his wife was not the prey.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.840
This is slightly
on the light side, Uhtred.

40:34.640 --> 40:38.360
I should be properly compensated
for the hospitality I have shown the girl.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.640
You were compensated

40:40.480 --> 40:42.600
by whatever you stole from the dead Queen.

40:46.440 --> 40:48.400
People do not entirely change, Haesten.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.520
Let them through!

40:54.600 --> 40:55.960
News from Rumcofa!

40:58.360 --> 41:00.560
- Fetch the guard!
- This way?

41:00.640 --> 41:01.720
Lord Aelfweard.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.680
- I'm Aethelstan--
- I know who you are.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.840
I cannot forget the boy held hostage
with me in Winchester

41:08.840 --> 41:10.400
who offered the Danes his life for mine.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.560
There is talk of an uprising in Rumcofa.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.120
People there found
the men that slew the visionary.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.960
You need to go inside immediately.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.680
And you need to fetch the King… now.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.200
We were close in spirit once.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.960
When she was first brought
to the palace, I felt…

41:52.080 --> 41:54.080
…I had found…

41:55.560 --> 41:57.560
not a beloved but at least a friend.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.760
Someone should tell her father.

42:03.680 --> 42:08.960
That falls to me, as penance
for ignoring his warnings about the Danes.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.320
Have him brought
from the road to Scotland.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.600
She was dishonored in life,
so she will be honored in death.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.200
We must ready both armies
to extract justice from Sigtryggr.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.600
His wife… for mine.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.040
I have been told the news.

42:53.920 --> 42:54.800
It is…

42:57.320 --> 42:59.000
…beyond words.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.640
I did not know her well…

43:05.240 --> 43:08.400
But you humped her husband nonetheless…

43:10.280 --> 43:11.880
ignored the bonds of matrimony,

43:11.960 --> 43:14.600
gave your flesh freely
and brought the wrath of God.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.640
Lord…

43:18.160 --> 43:20.040
that is your own guilt speaking.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.680
Do not seek to place this on me
for I am blameless--

43:22.760 --> 43:23.960
We are not blameless!

43:25.920 --> 43:28.280
How can this be anything
other than judgment?

43:29.560 --> 43:32.480
My God is not vengeful
and neither should you be.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.120
This is the work of men, not God.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.240
Find the men that wronged her
and have them feel your wrath.

43:44.080 --> 43:44.920
Forgive me.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.320
I'm not myself.

43:51.720 --> 43:56.160
In truth, I feel a burning shame.
I did not love her as I vowed to.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.880
I am not… I am not a good man.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.520
You are a good man.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.640
It matters not you did not love her.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.800
Others did. That is enough.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.920
Tell the boy the dreadful news.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
<i>Pity him.</i>

44:25.760 --> 44:27.040
Do not pity yourself.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.120
Think of no one but me.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.120
Look at nothing but my eyes.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.240
Feel nothing but my body.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.240
Swear to me this will not destroy you.

46:02.200 --> 46:05.400
Be a good king, not a good man.

46:12.480 --> 46:16.160
Men, women and children
herded into my church and slaughtered.

46:17.080 --> 46:19.320
Farm boys wrenched
from their loving mothers.

46:20.920 --> 46:25.400
All unprovoked,
all taken when they had no sword.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.840
What reason did they give
for the King's wrath?

46:28.760 --> 46:30.960
They claimed it was revenge
for the death of the Queen.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.160
Their reason is to cleanse
all Danes from Saxon lands.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.960
Although they have lived alongside them
for many years,

46:38.040 --> 46:39.480
they do not want them there.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.680
Your new King and Queen will protect you.

46:42.760 --> 46:46.200
You are no longer people of Mercia
but live under the shield of Eoferwic.

46:47.280 --> 46:50.320
Christians will not harm you here.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.040
Ordinary Christians do not hate Danes.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.600
And yet Edward
will no longer let us thrive here!

46:57.360 --> 46:58.320
We will avenge you.

47:01.840 --> 47:02.840
We will avenge you.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.240
We have to go to war.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.920
We will go north and confront Sigtryggr.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.960
Send word he will pay in blood
for this affront to us all.

47:30.520 --> 47:32.720
You fight under one king
for the first time.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.240
No longer men of Wessex or Mercia…

47:38.040 --> 47:40.000
but Saxons all.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.120
Come.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.600
Take some guards to find Lord Aethelhelm.
Bring him home to us, child.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.480


48:04.080 --> 48:06.720
Sihtric… tell me.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.360
News is being spread in Aegelesburg

48:08.440 --> 48:10.680
with talk of confronting
the Danes in battle.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.240
- How did the news come?
- Lord Aethelhelm.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.160
He spoke of the dead visionary
and pressed for vengeance

48:17.240 --> 48:19.200
- but did not speak of the Queen.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.120
He did not know. She journeyed in secret.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.040
What if he planned it?

48:30.720 --> 48:32.280
- The killing…
- What? Of his own daughter?

48:32.360 --> 48:33.400
No, of Aalys.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.560
Aethelhelm was unaware
his daughter traveled with the pilgrims.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.680
So he arranged to kill the visionary
to poison the people against the Danes.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.040
Then I almost pity him.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.240
Do not pity him.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.000
What he has unleashed
will throw my daughter against the Saxons.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.880
- We must alert Edward to the enemy within.
- Lord!

49:01.000 --> 49:02.280
What are you doing here?

49:03.640 --> 49:04.960
Aelfwynn is in Buccstan.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.240
What news of Rumcofa?

49:15.280 --> 49:16.760
- What of my son?
- My family?

49:16.840 --> 49:17.960
Your son lives, Lord.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.320
Your wife and children too, but…

49:21.560 --> 49:23.040
many in Rumcofa…

49:25.520 --> 49:26.520
Where is Osferth?

49:27.880 --> 49:30.800
- Finan, where is Osferth?
- Finan!

49:32.240 --> 49:35.040
Tell us. Where is Osferth?

49:41.200 --> 49:42.440
Make way for the King!

49:45.200 --> 49:48.160
Sigtryggr, let me lead a warrior band.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.200
Let me do
more than buttress a shield wall.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.000
Let him join the vanguard. Walk out front.

50:04.680 --> 50:07.240
If you ask me to, I will turn back now.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.640
I will not ask.

50:09.720 --> 50:13.320
If the King seeks to threaten us,
we retaliate…

50:14.720 --> 50:17.280
even if it means fighting
against those that I love.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.440
I never wanted to rend you
from your family.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.680
I held the peace
so I may hold you, unfractured.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.800
I am not fractured.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.560
And we are united.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.600
We leave to join our men
on the border without delay.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.600
We summon the Saxon king!

50:53.480 --> 50:57.040
And in three days… in three days,

50:57.120 --> 51:00.480
our army will destroy
Edward's army upon the high hills.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.520
Yes.

51:01.600 --> 51:07.200
In three days, we slaughter him,
his offspring

51:07.280 --> 51:09.080
and those who fight in his name.

51:12.840 --> 51:14.720
Tell the coward boy the battle place.

51:15.400 --> 51:16.880
Tell him Sigtryggr will be waiting.

51:17.520 --> 51:24.520
Sigtryggr!

51:41.880 --> 51:43.120
Lord Aethelhelm.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.800
We have scattered many men
in search of you.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.320
And you're the one to find gold.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.800
I've been asked to bring you back
to Aegelesburg.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.840
Why?

51:57.440 --> 51:59.360
I do not know the reason, Lord.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.120
Please just return with me.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.320
Not today.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.400
Feed him.

52:08.640 --> 52:09.600
Make him welcome.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.400
This way, Lord Aethelstan.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.440
The little bastard knows something
he will not tell me.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.360
Perhaps you'd like to get it out of him.

52:24.320 --> 52:29.000
Come, see the men we have gathered
for this adventure.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.200
- The King will need--
- Lord, I must speak.

52:35.080 --> 52:38.640
The bastard may be concealing
that which I myself learned in Rumcofa.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.640
Your daughter was traveling
with the pilgrims

52:46.720 --> 52:48.040
and was also slaughtered.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.320
Lord.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.240
Did you hear that?

53:06.880 --> 53:08.520
I saw her body in Rumcofa, Lord.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.720
It's been taken to her husband.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.240
Forgive me, had we any idea…

53:18.000 --> 53:19.320
Lord, it's not my fault.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
Had you have said…

53:25.520 --> 53:28.120
I think it is quite clear
where the blame lies.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.320
Lord, put down the knife.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.360
No.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.040
It is the honorable way.

54:10.120 --> 54:12.760
Since when have we done
the honorable thing, Lord?

54:13.440 --> 54:15.480
Your grandson needs you alive.

54:16.800 --> 54:20.760
My grandson's fortunes are ruined.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.360
Without the Queen…

54:25.960 --> 54:27.920
…our influence dies.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.240
Then make them rise again.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.760
Finish what you've started.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.160
I know you can do this, Lord. I know it.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.080
Find yourself.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.120
Find it.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.600
Fight.
