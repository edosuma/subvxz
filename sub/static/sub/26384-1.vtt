<i>Testing.</i>

01:30.717 --> 01:33.318
<i>Okay, so here we are.</i>

01:33.320 --> 01:36.054
<i>My name's Dawn, Dawn DeFeo,</i>

01:36.056 --> 01:38.456
<i>and this is where I live.</i>

01:38.458 --> 01:41.759
<i>It's finally here,
my big day.</i>

01:41.761 --> 01:45.196
<i>Eighteen and ready
to conquer the world.</i>

01:45.198 --> 01:47.464
<i>Back here, my family's
throwing a party.</i>

01:47.466 --> 01:50.634
<i>As if Italians need another
excuse to celebrate.</i>

01:50.636 --> 01:53.071
<i>Say hello to my new camera,
Allison.</i>

01:53.073 --> 01:55.306
<i>Hello to my new camera,
Allison.</i>

01:55.308 --> 01:57.144
<i>Smartass.</i>

01:59.179 --> 02:00.743
<i>Just my luck, right?</i>

02:00.745 --> 02:02.712
<i>Born on the same day
as my big, dumb brother.</i>

02:04.316 --> 02:08.584
<i>Bring it back!
Shaggy took my Weeble.</i>

02:08.586 --> 02:10.720
Fanabla, <i>Jody!
You ruined my shot!</i>

02:10.722 --> 02:12.692
<i>I'm telling!</i>

02:14.258 --> 02:15.826
<i>Hey, cut it out, you pigs!</i>

02:15.828 --> 02:19.128
<i>Marc, don't make me break
your other arm.</i>

02:19.130 --> 02:22.231
<i>You rotten little shits!
Stop it! Mom!</i>

02:22.233 --> 02:25.233
<i>And this is my mommy,
who makes the best cakes</i>

02:25.235 --> 02:27.636
<i>and the best cannoli
in the whole entire world.</i>

02:27.638 --> 02:31.474
<i>I spent all day long making
this cake. What're doing?</i>

02:31.476 --> 02:34.342
<i>Ronnie!
What are you doing?</i>

02:34.344 --> 02:38.112
<i>You're turning my $1.19 a pound
ground round into charred ash!</i>

02:38.114 --> 02:41.381
<i>Where's Butch? Better not be
smoking that shit again.</i>

02:41.383 --> 02:44.218
- <i>Get out here!</i>
- <i>All right, I'm here.</i>

02:44.220 --> 02:46.724
<i>Quit busting my chops.
Get out of my face.</i>

02:52.461 --> 02:54.728
Now look what
I've gone and done.

02:54.730 --> 02:57.396
Ma, I'm not six years old
anymore, all right. Cut it out.

02:57.398 --> 03:01.335
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't
get smark with your mother.

03:01.337 --> 03:02.735
Been looking for you
for 20 minutes. Where you been?

03:02.737 --> 03:04.603
I was with Donna Benedettio,

03:04.605 --> 03:06.605
helping her fix the antennae
on her television.

03:06.607 --> 03:09.709
I bet that wasn't all you were
doing. Donna Benedettio.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.210
I don't want you hanging out
with that <i>puttana.</i>

03:11.212 --> 03:12.611
She's from the gutter.

03:12.613 --> 03:14.379
What plays in the gutter
stays in the gutter.

03:14.381 --> 03:16.482
Don't forget that.
Right, we're from Brooklyn.

03:16.484 --> 03:17.716
Makes us practically royalty.

03:17.718 --> 03:19.519
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

03:19.521 --> 03:22.387
Ronnie, please,
stop it, it's his day.

03:22.389 --> 03:24.555
His day, every day's his day.

03:24.557 --> 03:26.892
Hanging around my house
like a bum.

03:26.894 --> 03:29.360
Huh, smoking pot
with his hippy friends,

03:29.362 --> 03:31.429
not out in the real world
making something of himself,

03:31.431 --> 03:33.565
fighting for his country
like a real man, huh?

03:33.567 --> 03:36.803
Send him to that hell so he
can come back in a bodybag?

03:38.537 --> 03:42.506
Besides, he's applied
to Syracuse for next semester,

03:42.508 --> 03:43.840
didn't you, Butch?

03:43.842 --> 03:45.409
He's gonna get in,
I know he will.

03:45.411 --> 03:46.876
Come on, who you kidding?

03:46.878 --> 03:48.447
He ain't got the brains
for college.

03:49.281 --> 03:50.648
Whoo!

03:50.650 --> 03:52.782
Now everyone be nice. Okay.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.951
- Hello sweetheart.
- Hi Papa.

03:54.953 --> 03:58.654
- Hi honey.
- Thank you for coming.

03:58.656 --> 04:02.357
Oh, we wouldn't miss this
blessed occasion, Louise.

04:02.359 --> 04:05.528
They grow up and they don't want
to visit Grandpa...

04:05.530 --> 04:07.664
- Silenzio, Michael.
- ...in the city.

04:07.666 --> 04:10.199
- Good to see you.
- You too.

04:10.201 --> 04:12.634
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Pappa.

04:12.636 --> 04:17.439
Look. You're going off
to college, I understand.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.773
Yeah.

04:18.774 --> 04:20.576
How you gonna get there?

04:20.577 --> 04:23.579
You're not gonna walk.
There, buddy.

04:23.581 --> 04:24.979
Don't be jealous.

04:24.981 --> 04:27.414
- Doll, here.
- No way.

04:27.416 --> 04:29.517
Pappa, no, it's all too much.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.618
Family is everything,
you know that.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.787
I own the dealership,
don't worry about it.

04:33.789 --> 04:35.522
Thank you, Nona. Guys, look!

04:35.524 --> 04:38.226
You're kidding me.

04:38.228 --> 04:40.293
Oh my gosh.

04:40.295 --> 04:42.629
These are some foxy wheels.

04:42.631 --> 04:44.331
This is groovy.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.932
Oh my god.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.901
- How do I look.
- You look so good.

04:47.903 --> 04:51.437
Give me those keys. If he wants
a car, he should earn it.

04:51.439 --> 04:52.872
Like I did.

04:52.874 --> 04:55.541
The last time I checked,
you were on my payroll.

04:55.543 --> 04:58.376
Give those back to the kid.
He's my grandson.

04:58.378 --> 05:00.379
I want him
to have those keys.

05:00.381 --> 05:03.782
Now stop this shit. Go inside
that fancy house of yours.

05:03.784 --> 05:06.888
Go get me a glass
of vino, please.

05:15.961 --> 05:19.563
<i>Maddon'.</i>
You call this marinara?

05:19.565 --> 05:21.699
That's how Ronnie likes it.

05:21.701 --> 05:25.806
Well, it tastes like your
father's old socks.

05:26.805 --> 05:28.605
- Ma, don't!
- What?

05:28.607 --> 05:31.742
Ronnie don't like
his gravy so strong.

05:31.744 --> 05:33.710
Is that man putting his hands
to you again?

05:33.712 --> 05:36.646
No, Ma, everything's good.

05:36.648 --> 05:39.882
In fact, we've been talking
about the future.

05:39.884 --> 05:42.254
The future?

05:43.455 --> 05:45.688
Yeah.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.424
I didn't want to say anything
until we made our decision,

05:48.426 --> 05:50.693
but...

05:50.695 --> 05:54.597
Ronnie got a job offer
in California.

05:54.599 --> 05:58.667
It's good money, and chance
for him to forge his own path.

05:58.669 --> 06:00.334
You know, and with Butch

06:00.336 --> 06:03.404
and then Dawn going
to college next year,

06:03.406 --> 06:05.342
we really don't need
all this room.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.711
Are you selling my house?

06:09.713 --> 06:11.478
I don't know, Ma, we...

06:11.480 --> 06:13.651
Like I said,
we haven't made any decisions.

06:16.051 --> 06:17.518
Hey Nona.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.986
Hi sweetheart.

06:18.988 --> 06:20.857
Mmm.

06:21.690 --> 06:23.657
Love you, Mom.

06:23.659 --> 06:26.962
I don't want you kids down the
cellar all day. We got company.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.601
You know, they say if you play
this song backwards

06:36.603 --> 06:38.603
you can hear the voice
of Satan.

06:38.605 --> 06:41.841
It's the sound your mother made
when she gave birth to you.

06:41.843 --> 06:43.608
Ha ha ha, real funny.

06:43.610 --> 06:46.012
All right,
name your first crush.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.612
Loretta Lynn.

06:48.614 --> 06:49.948
Shut the fuck up, Beak.
I've got it.

06:49.950 --> 06:53.352
Angie fucking Dickinson,
<i>Police Woman.</i>

06:53.354 --> 06:56.021
What I wouldn't do with those
two magnificent melons.

06:56.023 --> 06:58.025
You're so gross.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.596
Butch DeFeo.

07:03.628 --> 07:05.331
Okay.

07:07.933 --> 07:09.599
Next one. A verb.

07:09.601 --> 07:11.501
Great, now I'm busy
smoking it.

07:11.503 --> 07:13.906
She said verb,
not herb, you putz.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.707
One more time, Pelskie,
and I'll...

07:16.709 --> 07:18.008
And you'll what, huh, Beak?

07:18.010 --> 07:20.709
Hey, guys, mellow the fuck out,
okay?

07:20.711 --> 07:22.682
I'll choose.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.382
Murder.

07:28.819 --> 07:30.687
Okay.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.891
Next one...

07:34.126 --> 07:35.492
Current state of mind.

07:35.494 --> 07:37.426
Insane.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.532
Okay.

07:41.431 --> 07:44.400
And last one...

07:44.402 --> 07:45.801
favorite room in the house.

07:45.803 --> 07:47.503
Any room
where I can do this.

07:48.873 --> 07:51.140
You are disgusting,
you know that?

07:51.142 --> 07:53.574
You're a pig, Pelskie.
Oh, get off me.

07:53.576 --> 07:55.909
- Get her.
- Mess up my hair.

07:55.911 --> 07:58.882
Well, mine would be
the red room.

08:01.184 --> 08:02.916
What the hell is a red room?

08:02.918 --> 08:05.685
Well, read it,
and I'll show you.

08:05.687 --> 08:07.556
Okay.

08:09.624 --> 08:13.727
Butch DeFeo is going
to murder you

08:13.729 --> 08:17.099
after going insane
in the red room.

08:31.012 --> 08:34.013
This used to be
our secret hiding place.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.951
Come on, follow me.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.925
Whoa.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.429
Get off me.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.029
Hey, did you see that?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.998
Watch your fuckin' hands,
you jerk!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.101
That wasn't me.
That was a ghost.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.176
Come on in, gather around.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.679
Nope.

09:08.713 --> 09:10.080
Butch, aren't you coming?

09:10.082 --> 09:13.652
All right.

09:16.855 --> 09:18.423
Right here.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.927
Now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

09:26.563 --> 09:28.230
Okay.

09:28.232 --> 09:31.500
Now, growing up on Long Island,
we've all heard the stories

09:31.502 --> 09:34.803
about how this area was believed
to be a portal

09:34.805 --> 09:36.837
of spirit energy,

09:36.839 --> 09:39.777
a place where the living
could commune with the dead.

09:41.811 --> 09:44.547
This book belonged
to our grandmother.

09:47.916 --> 09:49.716
In order for a summoning
to take place,

09:49.718 --> 09:51.921
there must always
be an offering.

09:58.994 --> 10:02.228
She taught us that if we focused
our thoughts hard enough

10:02.230 --> 10:05.532
we could harness that energy
and invite it in.

10:05.534 --> 10:07.569
Hmm.

10:20.914 --> 10:22.580
Your mother sucks cocks
in hell.

10:22.582 --> 10:23.952
Shhh.

10:37.563 --> 10:42.702
Now that is seriously
some heavy shit.

11:13.698 --> 11:15.731
What in God's name
is going on down here?

11:15.733 --> 11:18.299
Daddy, we were just
playing around, okay?

11:18.301 --> 11:21.702
Get your ass upstairs if you
know what's good for you.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.837
Hmm? Goes for the rest
of you.

11:23.839 --> 11:25.606
Get the hell out of my house,
you goddamn losers.

11:25.608 --> 11:28.843
All of you, get out!
Get out! Get out!

11:28.845 --> 11:30.278
Daddy, listen to me.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.346
Okay, it wasn't his fault.

11:32.348 --> 11:34.681
I'm the one that told them
they could go in there.

11:34.683 --> 11:36.749
Haven't I told you I don't allow
dopers and whores

11:36.751 --> 11:40.020
or <i>mulignans</i> in my house,
didn't I tell you that?

11:40.022 --> 11:41.821
- Huh?
- That's funny.

11:41.823 --> 11:44.291
'Cause all I see is a sad,
pathetic old pig.

11:44.293 --> 11:47.960
No! Butch! Are you okay?

11:47.962 --> 11:50.196
- What'd you call me?
- Daddy, no!

11:50.198 --> 11:52.263
No, not that, please!

11:52.265 --> 11:55.200
No! No,
you're not doing that, Daddy!

11:55.202 --> 11:58.103
Huh? Huh?

11:58.105 --> 12:00.271
Who do you think you are?

12:00.273 --> 12:01.777
Don't you ever...

12:02.677 --> 12:04.075
ever...

12:04.077 --> 12:06.646
ever talk to me
that way again.

12:06.648 --> 12:08.148
That's enough!

12:09.081 --> 12:10.914
Daddy, please.

12:10.916 --> 12:13.717
Get upstairs, you little pansy.
Change your clothes.

12:13.719 --> 12:15.889
Your mother wants to cut
the goddamn cake.

12:18.825 --> 12:22.159
Butch, let me see.
Are you okay?

12:22.161 --> 12:24.030
Oh my god.

12:25.296 --> 12:27.199
It's okay.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.336
It's looking better.

12:31.871 --> 12:33.973
Gotta get out
of this house, Butch.

12:35.373 --> 12:37.307
Just gotta drive somewhere,

12:37.309 --> 12:39.208
far away,
as far as we can go.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.444
I've tried.

12:41.446 --> 12:44.814
- Right? He always finds me.
- Please.

12:44.816 --> 12:48.988
It's never gonna end, until that
son of a bitch is gone for good.

12:51.088 --> 12:53.992
It's either gonna be us or him,
you know that.

13:05.369 --> 13:09.905

Happy birthday, Butch,

13:29.991 --> 13:32.058
my favorite brother
in the whole wide world.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.695
Thanks buddy.

13:34.963 --> 13:37.263
Happy 23rd, son.

13:37.265 --> 13:39.164
My baby's all grown up.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.902
I'm so proud.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.405
Hey.

13:48.108 --> 13:50.142
See? My son.

15:42.216 --> 15:44.251
Okay.

16:57.385 --> 16:59.988
This song gets me so hot.

17:00.522 --> 17:02.622
It's the best.

17:02.624 --> 17:04.594
The best!

17:11.464 --> 17:13.464
What's wrong?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.467
Hmm?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.338
Can I get your attention?

17:25.046 --> 17:29.380
Take me inside
and fuck me.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.448
You know I can't do that.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.419
Why not? Are you afraid big bad
Ronnie'll catch you in the act?

17:35.421 --> 17:36.987
Give you another beating?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.125
Hey, shut your trap!

17:41.393 --> 17:44.593
Hey, did you bring
that acid tab for me?

17:44.595 --> 17:47.331
Really? We've been going
together six months.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.100
- That's all I'm good for?
- No.

17:51.102 --> 17:54.471
<i>You're listening to WAGL 1340,</i>

17:54.473 --> 17:57.707
<i>the smooth sounds
of Long Island.</i>

17:57.709 --> 18:00.041
But you brought it?

18:00.043 --> 18:01.711
Oh shut up already.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.482
All right.

18:15.725 --> 18:18.359
Last train to nirvana,

18:18.361 --> 18:20.563
ready for departure.

19:01.368 --> 19:04.803
Donna? Donna, someone's inside.
They've got a gun.

19:06.472 --> 19:09.240
Stop! Stop!

19:15.516 --> 19:18.586
Get off! Get off! Get...!
Donna, get off!

19:20.385 --> 19:21.754
Donna... Dawn?!

19:27.125 --> 19:30.527
Needle dick,
piece of shit!

19:30.529 --> 19:32.430
Son of a fucking bitch!

19:32.432 --> 19:35.832
Have you lost
your goddamn mind?!

19:35.834 --> 19:39.334
Damn you, Ronnie,
let me back in this goddamn car!

19:39.336 --> 19:43.139
I need my fucking shoe!

19:52.382 --> 19:54.449
Fuck you!

20:27.649 --> 20:30.719
Whoo.

20:54.508 --> 20:55.708
Who's there?

21:37.749 --> 21:41.217
<i>Some people have
a deep, abiding respect</i>

21:41.219 --> 21:44.721
<i>for the natural beauty
that was once this country.</i>

21:45.923 --> 21:48.492
<i>And some people don't.</i>

21:49.526 --> 21:51.692
<i>People start pollution,</i>

21:51.694 --> 21:53.597
<i>people can stop it.</i>

22:52.685 --> 22:54.521
Ow!

23:08.667 --> 23:09.968
What...?

24:03.484 --> 24:05.484
Oh my God.

25:26.862 --> 25:28.728
Mom?

25:28.730 --> 25:30.066
I'm home.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.871
<i>And now,
for a morsel</i>

26:13.873 --> 26:15.705
<i>of mind-melting madness.</i>

26:18.177 --> 26:19.777
Trick or treat!

26:19.779 --> 26:21.578
Oh, look
what the cat dragged in.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.215
Hey, leave some
for the rest of the block.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.087
Why do I have
to be Cinderella again?

26:30.089 --> 26:34.223
Woolworths don't have Howdy
Doody in your size. Hold still.

26:34.225 --> 26:38.028
What's with these flimsy five
and dime costumes these days?

26:38.030 --> 26:42.598
In my day, Halloween
was a serious business.

26:42.600 --> 26:48.537
In the old country we called it
<i>La Notte delle Streghe.</i>

26:48.539 --> 26:50.206
The Night of the Witches.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.941
Witches? Real witches?

26:52.943 --> 26:55.611
Ma, enough. I don't want you
scaring the kids.

26:55.613 --> 26:59.214
Yes, Bella, witches,
real witches.

26:59.216 --> 27:02.616
See, in ancient times,
it was the night

27:02.618 --> 27:05.620
the dead
returned to their homes,

27:05.622 --> 27:09.591
when dark spirits ran amok
across the countryside,

27:09.593 --> 27:11.625
and when offerings were made

27:11.627 --> 27:14.863
for the coming
of the winter solstice.

27:14.865 --> 27:18.564
Offerings like giving candy?

27:18.566 --> 27:20.167
No.

27:20.169 --> 27:23.873
I'm talking
about real offerings.

27:24.672 --> 27:26.539
Sacrifices.

27:26.541 --> 27:28.007
Ma, give it a rest.

27:28.009 --> 27:29.810
Bang bang!

27:29.812 --> 27:31.245
- Oh no!
- You're dead!

27:31.247 --> 27:33.613
Jody, no shooting
in this house.

27:33.615 --> 27:36.047
You can't kill the undead.

27:36.049 --> 27:38.717
Who are you supposed to be?

27:38.719 --> 27:43.222
<i>♪ She was a V-A-M-P vamp ♪</i>

27:43.224 --> 27:46.958
Why don't you get your big,
fat vamp off my piano, huh?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.761
You let her go out
dressed like this?

27:48.763 --> 27:50.695
Daddy, get with the times.

27:50.697 --> 27:52.630
I'll get with the times when you
go upstairs and put on a coat.

27:52.632 --> 27:54.099
- No, but Dad...
- But nothing.

27:54.101 --> 27:56.737
You listen to your father.

28:00.207 --> 28:02.873
Butch, what are you doing
out of bed?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.842
I thought I heard something
in my room.

28:04.844 --> 28:07.578
Come here, you.
Shoot up all of Dodge City.

28:07.580 --> 28:08.712
Who are you, Wyatt Earp?

28:08.714 --> 28:09.847
Bang bang bang!

28:09.849 --> 28:13.317
What...
What did you hear, son?

28:13.319 --> 28:16.623
It sounded like voices.

28:17.556 --> 28:19.657
Voices?

28:19.659 --> 28:21.926
Butch, we've all
been downstairs.

28:21.928 --> 28:24.062
No, not your voices.

28:25.096 --> 28:27.066
Voices coming from my wall.

28:30.235 --> 28:32.001
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.203
I don't wanna be out
all night, all right?

28:34.205 --> 28:36.873
All right. Will you drop me off
at the train station?

28:36.875 --> 28:39.007
- Bring me my pocketbook.
- Oh, my gloves.

28:39.009 --> 28:42.180
Yes, we'll take you to the
train station, Ma. Let's go.

28:43.613 --> 28:46.615
Now Butch, I want you
to go upstairs

28:46.617 --> 28:48.584
and get in bed, <i>subito.</i>

28:48.586 --> 28:52.123
And if you get hungry, there's
minestrone in the ice box.

29:16.845 --> 29:18.612
Ronnie!

29:25.220 --> 29:27.185
If I see you, you're dead.

29:35.096 --> 29:37.863
Come on, where are ya?

29:37.865 --> 29:40.101
Show your face, I kill ya.

29:41.669 --> 29:43.401
It'll be okay, Jody.

29:47.106 --> 29:49.108
It's gonna be okay.

29:55.214 --> 29:58.018
Broke into
the wrong house, guys.

30:01.687 --> 30:04.121
Why would they do this?
They didn't even steal anything.

30:04.123 --> 30:06.659
I don't know.
It'll be okay.

30:10.261 --> 30:13.964
Where are ya?!
You're a dead man!

30:13.966 --> 30:15.296
Stay.

30:15.298 --> 30:17.201
Ronnie!

30:34.183 --> 30:36.319
Son of a bitch!

30:37.987 --> 30:39.923
Goddamn it.

30:43.025 --> 30:44.359
Where is he?

30:44.361 --> 30:48.195
No! No! No, Ronnie! Please!

30:48.197 --> 30:51.368
Get off me.
Where the fuck is he?

30:58.807 --> 31:01.041
Fucker. Where is it?
Where is it?

31:01.043 --> 31:03.475
I'm asking where it is!
Tell me, you son of a bitch.

31:03.477 --> 31:06.979
- Don't! Stop it!
- Where is it?

31:09.850 --> 31:12.484
Did you steal from me?!
Did you fucking steal from me?!

31:12.486 --> 31:16.856
Did you fucking steal from me?!
Did you fucking steal from me?!

31:16.858 --> 31:18.423
Stop, Daddy!

31:18.425 --> 31:20.759
If you fucking did
I'll kill you.

31:20.761 --> 31:22.394
You son a bitch!

31:22.396 --> 31:25.030
Let go of him!
Let go of him! Let go...

31:27.201 --> 31:31.406
That would be the cops.
I called them.

31:36.175 --> 31:37.942
Don't do it.

31:37.944 --> 31:41.010
Don't do it, Daddy.

31:41.012 --> 31:45.782
No broken windows,
no signs of forced entry,

31:45.784 --> 31:48.486
and you're not away
of anything that was stolen?

31:48.488 --> 31:50.519
Well, my husband's
personal safe...

31:50.521 --> 31:52.087
Nothing was taken, officer.

31:52.089 --> 31:54.324
- I put the kids down.
- Where's Butch?

31:54.326 --> 31:56.226
Who's Butch, ma'am?

31:56.228 --> 31:57.826
Oh, he's my eldest son.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.362
He's the only one
who's been home tonight.

31:59.364 --> 32:01.131
And is Butch
in the house now?

32:01.133 --> 32:03.833
Well yes,
but he's been quite ill.

32:03.835 --> 32:06.300
Doctors say he's got the bug
that's been going around.

32:06.302 --> 32:09.470
I'd still like to speak with
him, if it's all the same.

32:09.472 --> 32:11.239
You know, it's Halloween.

32:11.241 --> 32:13.208
It's probably some neighborhood
bums playing pranks.

32:13.210 --> 32:16.245
But they didn't take nothing
so let's just call it a night.

32:16.247 --> 32:18.846
- What do you say?
- Your son, Mr. DeFeo?

32:18.848 --> 32:20.114
Yeah.

32:20.116 --> 32:22.083
- Are you Butch DeFeo?
- Yes sir.

32:22.085 --> 32:24.951
Mind telling us what happened
while your family was out?

32:24.953 --> 32:29.422
I don't know. I was asleep
upstairs, like my mother said.

32:29.424 --> 32:31.292
I didn't hear nothing.

32:31.294 --> 32:34.027
Butch, sweetheart, you don't
look so good. Go upstairs.

32:34.029 --> 32:35.962
Hold on, hold on.

32:35.964 --> 32:39.099
You expect us to believe that
someone ransacked this house,

32:39.101 --> 32:41.368
except for the one you were in,
and you didn't hear a thing?

32:41.370 --> 32:44.004
If my boy says he didn't see
nothing or hear nothing,

32:44.006 --> 32:47.274
he didn't hear nothing,
that's all.

32:47.276 --> 32:49.876
All right, Mr. DeFeo,
thank you for your time.

32:49.878 --> 32:51.578
If you or your wife think
of anything else,

32:51.580 --> 32:53.947
or you find out
that something was stolen,

32:53.949 --> 32:55.947
please, give us a call.

32:55.949 --> 32:59.552
Oh, thank you very much,
appreciate it, guys.

32:59.554 --> 33:03.488
Incidently, sir, shouldn't have
your firearm out like that.

33:03.490 --> 33:06.257
Yeah, you're right.
Have a good night, guys.

33:06.259 --> 33:08.362
Keep your family safe.

33:10.095 --> 33:11.765
Let's get out of here.

33:18.604 --> 33:20.405
Did you do it, Butch?

33:20.407 --> 33:22.439
Did you take the money
from the safe?

33:22.441 --> 33:24.908
You'd be the first
to know if I did.

33:24.910 --> 33:29.111
You've been acting weird
ever since...

33:29.113 --> 33:31.281
Since the moment you decided we
should play the game

33:31.283 --> 33:33.019
with them again.

33:37.289 --> 33:41.390
Remember when we used
to talk to them?

33:41.392 --> 33:43.559
And they would
keep us safe

33:43.561 --> 33:49.298
whenever Daddy was drinking
or in one of his moods?

33:49.300 --> 33:53.235
Well, something different
happened there the other day.

33:53.237 --> 33:58.639
Okay, I don't know what it was
or how to explain it, but...

33:58.641 --> 34:02.946
it was almost
like we made them angry.

34:03.614 --> 34:05.249
How?

34:09.319 --> 34:12.253
What did they used
to tell us?

34:12.255 --> 34:14.190
How we would always live here.

34:16.292 --> 34:18.625
We've been talking
about moving out.

34:18.627 --> 34:20.995
Mom and Dad have been talking
about moving out.

34:20.996 --> 34:22.996
Come on, Butch.

34:22.998 --> 34:25.130
We were kids, playing a game.

34:25.132 --> 34:27.369
It was all
in our imagination.

34:32.039 --> 34:33.907
Well...

34:33.909 --> 34:35.945
if we did wake them up...

34:37.378 --> 34:40.215
then maybe there's a way
we can put them back to sleep.

36:07.997 --> 36:11.634
- Talk to me.
- Where is it?!

36:12.533 --> 36:15.102
What?

36:15.104 --> 36:17.069
- Where is it?!
- I don't understand!

36:17.071 --> 36:19.238
Where is it? Where is it?

36:19.240 --> 36:21.173
What's happening?

36:21.175 --> 36:23.608
- Where is it? Fucking money!
- What?! What?!

36:33.253 --> 36:36.154
I'm gonna die, Louise.

36:36.156 --> 36:38.992
- Ronnie!
- I'm gonna die!

37:25.203 --> 37:28.836
<i>And here's the star
of</i> Name That Song,

37:28.838 --> 37:31.476
<i>Jack Atwater.</i>

39:18.407 --> 39:20.407
Quick, shut the door

39:20.409 --> 39:22.245
What's going on?

39:24.380 --> 39:26.181
There's someone parked
across the street.

39:26.183 --> 39:28.583
Butch, they've been watching
the house.

39:28.585 --> 39:30.885
Yeah, they're still there.

39:30.887 --> 39:32.523
Butch, go look.

39:33.489 --> 39:35.522
They're right there.

39:35.524 --> 39:37.827
Butch, don't let 'em
see you.

39:39.861 --> 39:43.296
I wonder if it's the people
who broke into the house.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.964
Do you think they're casing
the neighborhood?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.399
Should I call the cops again?

39:46.401 --> 39:48.570
Looks like they're gone now.

39:53.574 --> 39:55.441
Butch, I don't know.

39:55.443 --> 39:58.244
I have a strange feeling
that something really bad's

39:58.246 --> 40:00.182
about to happen.

40:01.548 --> 40:03.349
Butch, why ain't you
talking to me?

40:05.353 --> 40:07.288
You okay?

40:14.460 --> 40:18.332
Stop playing around, okay?
You're really scaring me.

40:23.903 --> 40:25.735
Butch, stop,
what are you doing?

40:25.737 --> 40:27.740
Yes.

40:28.874 --> 40:30.544
Yes.

40:32.244 --> 40:35.248
Don't blame her.
It's not her fault.

40:36.816 --> 40:39.014
Yes.

40:39.016 --> 40:41.219
Let go.

40:42.419 --> 40:43.688
Yes.

40:46.390 --> 40:48.660
I can't do that.

40:54.264 --> 40:55.699
Not now.

40:59.336 --> 41:00.872
I promise.

42:25.351 --> 42:27.353
What are you doing
in here?

42:28.353 --> 42:31.756
Butch?

42:57.114 --> 42:58.613
Daddy, what is going on?

42:58.615 --> 43:00.581
- Stay right here, don't move.
- No.

43:03.852 --> 43:06.522
Knock it off, Shaggy!

43:11.026 --> 43:12.859
It's just me.

43:12.861 --> 43:14.763
Shh.

43:31.044 --> 43:34.478
Good boy.

43:42.156 --> 43:44.422
Daddy!

43:44.424 --> 43:46.393
Son of a bitch.

43:48.661 --> 43:52.566
Come to my house
in the middle of the night!

43:57.769 --> 44:00.039
Show your face, you coward!

44:05.211 --> 44:07.509
Come on, I'm waiting!

44:07.511 --> 44:08.980
Come on!

44:10.982 --> 44:13.085
It's okay.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.225
Yes.

44:23.227 --> 44:25.493
<i>For the last time,
I wanna know what's going on.</i>

44:25.495 --> 44:27.129
I know.

44:27.131 --> 44:29.701
<i>There's nothing
going on. go back to bed.</i>

44:30.501 --> 44:32.468
But I can't.

44:32.470 --> 44:35.636
<i>I'm scared. I saw a man
in a car outside my window.</i>

44:35.638 --> 44:37.641
I don't want to.

44:39.242 --> 44:40.907
<i>Would you
listen to her?</i>

44:40.909 --> 44:42.909
<i>Your family's lives
are in danger.</i>

44:42.911 --> 44:44.878
You can't make me...

44:44.880 --> 44:48.682
<i>You're insane? This
goddamn family's gone insane!</i>

44:48.684 --> 44:50.520
...kill them.

45:07.602 --> 45:11.070
I can't talk about it right now,
Ma, I've got too much going on.

45:11.072 --> 45:13.505
Yes, I'm gonna make the lasagne.
I'm making your favorite recipe.

45:13.507 --> 45:16.075
I'm gonna kill both of you
if you don't knock it off.

45:16.077 --> 45:18.077
I've got finals
to study for.

45:18.079 --> 45:19.778
These kids are driving me
up the wall.

45:19.780 --> 45:21.713
No, Ma, not this weekend.

45:21.715 --> 45:23.949
I've got too much going on.

45:23.951 --> 45:25.850
Tell Dad thank you
for the card.

45:25.852 --> 45:28.118
Of course we're coming
for Thanksgiving.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.623
Oh shoot! I don't remember, is
it two cups of polenta or three?

45:31.625 --> 45:33.991
I've gotta go, Ma. Ronnie's
almost home. Talk to you later.

45:33.993 --> 45:36.227
Love you, bye.

45:36.229 --> 45:38.165
That's not fair.
I want some.

45:39.866 --> 45:43.233
Marc, what did I tell you?
No fluffernutter before supper.

45:43.235 --> 45:46.003
Goddamnit, Ma, these are
the best things going!

45:46.005 --> 45:48.805
You watch that filthy mouth
or I will wash it out with soap!

45:48.807 --> 45:50.740
Oh, Ma.

45:50.742 --> 45:54.278
Allison, do not even think about
drinking out of that bottle.

45:57.016 --> 45:58.947
Oh, damn it, Allison!

45:58.949 --> 46:00.315
Sorry. It was an accident.

46:00.317 --> 46:02.585
- Clean it up.
- I'm cleaning it.

46:02.587 --> 46:05.186
- Hey, Mrs. D.
- Is Butch around?

46:05.188 --> 46:07.056
- Hi boys. He's up in his room.
- Scram.

46:07.058 --> 46:09.625
He's still feeling
under the weather.

46:09.627 --> 46:12.661
What's wrong with him? Haven't
seen his ugly mug for weeks.

46:12.663 --> 46:15.062
- I wish I knew.
- Give me that!

46:15.064 --> 46:18.033
- It's almost time to eat.
- Is there pasta?

46:18.035 --> 46:20.234
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind at all.

46:20.236 --> 46:22.803
- Doesn't your mother feed you?
- Sure.

46:22.805 --> 46:26.841
There's no comparison between
her rump roast and yours.

46:26.843 --> 46:30.009
Stop. Cut it out. Stop.

46:30.011 --> 46:32.913
Come on, guys. Last one upstairs
is a rotten egg.

46:32.915 --> 46:34.985
Stop. It's my dad.

46:37.085 --> 46:39.018
Well, I guess I'm late
to the party, huh?

46:39.020 --> 46:41.956
Ronnie, they were
just horsing around.

46:41.958 --> 46:43.726
Yeah, I can see that.

46:44.726 --> 46:46.593
Having a big party?

46:46.595 --> 46:50.129
Butch should be down soon,
if you wanna stay for supper.

46:50.131 --> 46:52.999
Yeah, sure. Why not?

46:53.001 --> 46:55.068
Therefore...

46:55.070 --> 46:58.638
<i>I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

46:58.640 --> 47:00.339
It's been three months,

47:00.341 --> 47:02.373
they're still playing
this bullshit.

47:02.375 --> 47:04.809
Leave it to the bleeding heart
liberal media to stick it

47:04.811 --> 47:06.280
to the last great leader.

47:08.148 --> 47:10.285
What do you say, fellas?
Can I offer you a cold one?

47:11.317 --> 47:14.052
Uh... Sure, Mr. DeFeo.

47:14.054 --> 47:16.355
There you go.

47:16.357 --> 47:18.158
Yeah.

47:20.660 --> 47:23.730
Daddy, I'm just trying
to study here.

47:30.069 --> 47:32.268
Ahh.

47:32.270 --> 47:35.771
You know, back in my day, when
we paid our neighbors a visit

47:35.773 --> 47:38.877
we showed our elders
the proper respect.

47:40.811 --> 47:43.213
We didn't put our lazy
unshowered, good-for-nothing

47:43.215 --> 47:45.151
keisters on
their fine furniture.

47:47.119 --> 47:49.951
We didn't sit inappropriately
next to their teenage daughters.

47:49.953 --> 47:51.754
Daddy, please stop.

47:51.756 --> 47:55.424
And we especially
didn't make lewd sexual remarks

47:55.426 --> 47:57.025
in front
of our own mothers.

47:57.027 --> 47:59.094
Hey, Mom, I'll help you.

47:59.096 --> 48:01.897
Back in my day...

48:01.899 --> 48:03.832
- we showed 'em who was boss.
- Daddy...

48:03.834 --> 48:05.999
- In my day, that's what we did!
- Daddy!

48:06.001 --> 48:07.769
We showed 'em who was boss!

48:07.771 --> 48:09.736
We showed 'em who was boss!

48:09.738 --> 48:11.939
- We showed 'em who was boss!
- No!

48:11.941 --> 48:13.807
You see that?!
Is that what you want?!

48:13.809 --> 48:15.108
You fuckin' mutt!

48:15.110 --> 48:16.713
Leave her alone!

48:18.380 --> 48:20.881
Let's show the boys a little
party. Is that what you want?

48:20.883 --> 48:23.083
You little whore!
Is that what you are?!

48:23.085 --> 48:25.451
You want these fucking mutts
all over you?!

48:27.422 --> 48:30.891
Is that what you like? You want
these animals all over you?!

48:30.893 --> 48:33.793
You want these fucking mutts
all over you?!

48:33.795 --> 48:36.929
You want these fucking animals'
hands all over you?!

48:36.931 --> 48:39.200
I'll fucking kill you!

48:44.939 --> 48:46.738
<i>I hope</i>

48:46.740 --> 48:50.175
<i>that I will have hastened
the start</i>

48:50.177 --> 48:52.378
<i>of that process of healing</i>

48:52.380 --> 48:54.445
<i>which is so
desperately needed.</i>

48:54.447 --> 48:58.049
<i>I regred deeply any injuries
that may have been done</i>

48:58.051 --> 49:01.087
<i>in the course of the events
that led to this decision.</i>

49:04.056 --> 49:08.728
<i>...rediscover
those shared ideas...</i>

49:20.305 --> 49:22.008
Let me see, Mom.

49:26.177 --> 49:28.914
This has been going on
for years.

49:30.215 --> 49:34.386
It has to stop now
before it's too late.

49:36.820 --> 49:38.887
Did I ever tell you
I used to have

49:38.889 --> 49:43.193
the most vivid dreams when I was
a girl growing up in this house.

49:44.894 --> 49:48.763
I dreamed of having
my own family,

49:48.765 --> 49:51.301
the children I would bring
into this world.

49:54.338 --> 49:56.874
Your grandmother told me
they were premonitions.

49:57.974 --> 49:59.876
And she was right.

50:03.246 --> 50:05.148
But lately...

50:06.849 --> 50:09.052
my dreams
have been different.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.956
I see the end coming.

50:16.424 --> 50:18.961
A terrible...

50:19.861 --> 50:21.263
beautiful...

50:22.163 --> 50:23.432
end.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.336
I see rain...

50:28.569 --> 50:30.871
and blood.

50:31.838 --> 50:34.108
And when it's all over...

50:36.376 --> 50:38.045
...I feel...

50:38.845 --> 50:40.748
at peace.

50:43.883 --> 50:46.516
Because...

50:46.518 --> 50:49.189
we're all together
when it happens...

50:50.556 --> 50:52.825
in our safe place.

50:54.893 --> 50:56.395
In our home.

50:59.065 --> 51:01.768
<i>High Hopes.</i>

51:23.621 --> 51:28.891
Yeah, it don't take
much to point a gun at somebody.

51:28.893 --> 51:33.126
But it does take some serious
balls to pull that trigger.

51:33.128 --> 51:36.231
You made me proud
today, son.

51:36.233 --> 51:38.031
But remember this,

51:38.033 --> 51:40.200
next time it might be you
looking down the barrel

51:40.202 --> 51:42.238
of that rifle.

52:13.100 --> 52:15.236
What the hell?

52:49.702 --> 52:52.201
I'm fed up, Ronnie!
I don't wanna hear it no more!

52:52.203 --> 52:54.202
Louise, I've had that rifle
20 years.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.405
Never once did it misfire,
not once, okay?

52:56.407 --> 52:58.206
I checked the chamber.
There were two rounds in there.

52:58.208 --> 53:00.510
Should've blown my fucking head
off but it didn't.

53:00.512 --> 53:02.278
I know why now.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.546
I was spared, Louise.

53:03.548 --> 53:05.949
That's just great,
Ronnie!

53:05.951 --> 53:07.617
Now it's a sign from God

53:07.619 --> 53:09.283
of your redemption?

53:09.285 --> 53:11.719
You think locking us up
in these bars

53:11.721 --> 53:14.188
and putting statues all over
the house of the virgin Mary

53:14.190 --> 53:16.158
is gonna make up
for all your sins?

53:16.160 --> 53:18.326
You said yourself there's
something wrong with this house.

53:18.328 --> 53:21.330
You've always said that.
Maybe you're right.

53:21.332 --> 53:23.130
You really don't get it,
do you?

53:23.132 --> 53:26.099
It's not about
the goddamn house.

53:26.101 --> 53:28.436
It's about you.

53:28.438 --> 53:29.503
No.

53:29.505 --> 53:33.173
Open your eyes.

53:33.175 --> 53:34.474
Butch is in trouble,

53:34.476 --> 53:37.410
serious trouble.

53:37.412 --> 53:39.347
What are you gonna do about it?

53:39.349 --> 53:41.246
I've told you
a hundred times, Louise,

53:41.248 --> 53:43.482
I've got the goddamn devil on
my back with that fucking kid!

53:43.484 --> 53:45.652
Butch is not the devil.

53:45.654 --> 53:50.456
He's our son. And he needs us,
now more than ever.

53:50.458 --> 53:52.525
Six months in basic training
with the corp,

53:52.527 --> 53:55.261
that's what that kid needs,
they'll make a man out of him.

53:55.263 --> 53:56.995
He's hooked on drugs.

53:56.997 --> 54:00.365
He needs professional help,

54:00.367 --> 54:02.167
not a goddamn drill sargeant.

54:02.169 --> 54:05.137
No son of mine is going
to some methadone clinic.

54:05.139 --> 54:08.209
I'll commit him to Bellevue
before a place like that.

54:09.744 --> 54:12.111
I am done
with this conversation.

54:12.113 --> 54:14.445
Louise, I'm talking to you.

54:14.447 --> 54:17.014
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

54:17.016 --> 54:19.384
I am going to my mother and
fathers' and bringing the kids.

54:19.386 --> 54:21.251
No you're not.

54:21.253 --> 54:24.454
I need time away from this
house, and time away from you.

54:24.456 --> 54:27.324
You're not gonna leave me now.
I'm under so much pressure.

54:27.326 --> 54:30.260
Okay, listen to me, I'm begging
you. Just listen to me, Louise.

54:30.262 --> 54:34.330
If I don't come up with that
money I don't know what I'll do.

54:34.332 --> 54:37.200
I'm sorry, okay?
Just stay and talk to me.

54:37.202 --> 54:39.602
Be with me now, okay?
Please, I'm begging you.

54:39.604 --> 54:41.138
I'm begging you,
don't go over there.

54:41.140 --> 54:43.439
Don't go away now.

54:45.476 --> 54:47.610
Stay with me.

54:47.612 --> 54:49.478
Just...

54:49.480 --> 54:50.780
stay with me now.

54:50.782 --> 54:53.385
Jesus.

54:55.753 --> 54:57.389
Come with me.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.487
Butch?

55:43.363 --> 55:44.532
Look at this.

55:45.799 --> 55:48.567
Holy shit.

55:48.569 --> 55:50.869
Found it this morning.

55:50.871 --> 55:52.838
How much is there?

55:52.840 --> 55:56.144
$50 thousand, maybe more.

55:57.311 --> 56:00.345
Butch, you said
you didn't take it.

56:00.347 --> 56:02.650
I... I didn't.

56:04.617 --> 56:08.384
I mean, my mind
is all twisted up.

56:08.386 --> 56:10.821
I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

56:10.823 --> 56:13.623
I just spend night

56:13.625 --> 56:15.659
after night

56:15.661 --> 56:17.564
after night...

56:18.598 --> 56:19.833
watching.

56:21.365 --> 56:23.068
Watching what?

56:26.137 --> 56:28.338
Watching you.

56:33.677 --> 56:36.546
Did you know that the natives
on this part of Long Island

56:36.548 --> 56:38.750
have a ritual
for burying their dead?

56:41.451 --> 56:43.585
Every winter...

56:43.587 --> 56:48.460
they would banish
all the most savage criminals,

56:49.893 --> 56:51.692
all the outcasts,

56:51.694 --> 56:55.196
all the enemies
of the tribe.

56:55.198 --> 56:56.731
They would tie them to trees,

56:56.733 --> 57:00.736
leaving them to die slowly

57:02.338 --> 57:04.805
from the exposure,

57:04.807 --> 57:06.542
starvation...

57:09.244 --> 57:11.146
disease...

57:12.447 --> 57:14.183
madness.

57:15.317 --> 57:17.353
And then,
when they were dead...

57:18.219 --> 57:20.219
they would bury them,

57:20.221 --> 57:21.623
face down.

57:23.491 --> 57:27.825
Butch, look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

57:27.827 --> 57:29.528
but you have
to get out of here.

57:29.530 --> 57:32.598
Did you know that everyone
in this house

57:32.600 --> 57:34.836
sleeps face down?

57:35.870 --> 57:38.906
Every single night.

57:39.906 --> 57:41.842
No one stirs.

57:43.976 --> 57:45.445
Not even a sound.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.280
It's as if everyone

57:49.282 --> 57:51.719
goes to the same place...

57:53.320 --> 57:55.322
shares the same dream...

57:56.754 --> 58:00.526
All tucked warmly
in their beds.

58:02.493 --> 58:04.363
So quiet...

58:05.830 --> 58:07.399
a calm...

58:08.634 --> 58:10.503
so at peace.

59:13.694 --> 59:16.331
Butch... Butch, look.

59:24.671 --> 59:26.638
Butch, we have to get
out of here.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.609
Come on, let's go.

59:31.644 --> 59:33.009
What the fuck?!

59:33.011 --> 59:34.847
What have we done?

59:35.815 --> 59:37.581
We awakened them.

59:37.583 --> 59:42.920
Hey, Butch,
I overheard Daddy earlier.

59:42.922 --> 59:47.525
He was saying he wants to have
you locked up, committed.

59:47.527 --> 59:49.758
All right, we have to get you
someplace where he...

59:49.760 --> 59:54.363
I'll be okay.
But I think you should go.

59:54.365 --> 59:55.765
- What?
- Tonight.

59:55.767 --> 59:59.401
Okay, what are you
talking about?

59:59.403 --> 01:00:01.404
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:04.107
What do you think is gonna
happen to the kids if I'm gone?

01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:07.512
Don't you think he's gonna
go after them next?

01:00:09.447 --> 01:00:11.479
There is no way out.

01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:13.382
No.

01:00:13.384 --> 01:00:15.353
Not for any of us.

01:00:17.021 --> 01:00:18.789
Except you.

01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:15.234
He's dangerous.

01:06:19.794 --> 01:06:22.129
Go away!

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:40.813
Go away!

01:06:41.814 --> 01:06:43.950
Leave me alone!

01:06:50.188 --> 01:06:52.188
Leave me alone!

01:07:01.798 --> 01:07:04.035
Go away!

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.854
What if he refuses
to go?

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:20.493
- He's not gonna cooperate.
- He's lost his mind.

01:09:20.495 --> 01:09:23.331
We'll have
to restrain him.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:26.566
I'm telling you,
it's either us or him.

01:09:26.568 --> 01:09:29.268
I already mixed in
a sedative.

01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:33.042
I'm getting him
out of this house.

01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:37.309
What if
he refuses to go?

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.049
I've got
the devil on my back.

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:48.353
We might have
to restrain him.

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.858
Does everybody
know what to do?

01:09:55.429 --> 01:09:58.162
Do not let him know
what we're planning.

01:09:58.164 --> 01:10:01.068
I think
I hear him coming.

01:10:07.173 --> 01:10:09.073
We were getting worried
about you, son.

01:10:09.075 --> 01:10:10.941
You've been sleeping
all day.

01:10:10.943 --> 01:10:12.609
Huh? You must
be hungry, son.

01:10:12.611 --> 01:10:15.945
Come on, join us for some
supper, what do you say?

01:10:15.947 --> 01:10:17.381
Got my cast off today.

01:10:17.383 --> 01:10:20.050
Looks like I can
beat you up, again.

01:10:20.052 --> 01:10:21.618
Says someone
who fell down the stairs.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.953
You pushed me.

01:10:22.955 --> 01:10:24.921
- I did not.
- Yes you did.

01:10:24.923 --> 01:10:28.157
Go ahead, take your coat off,
son, have some dinner, come on.

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:30.358
Butch, come sit down, baby.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.497
I made you
your favorite dish.

01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:37.332
Hey Butch, any idea where
your sister might have gone?

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:41.136
- No sir.
- I'm sure she'll be back soon.

01:10:41.138 --> 01:10:43.938
Why don't we just enjoy
our last meal together?

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.279
Jody, would you like to lead
the family in grace?

01:10:54.184 --> 01:10:56.284
Thank you for our home so sweet;

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.219
Thank you for the food we eat;

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:00.454
Thank you for the birds
that sing;

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:01.989
Thank you God for everything.

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:05.359
Amen.

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.595
That was lovely.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.164
Shall we eat?

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:22.044
Some storm
we have tonight, huh?

01:11:24.745 --> 01:11:26.614
Want some?

01:11:31.052 --> 01:11:32.453
No. No!

01:11:35.188 --> 01:11:36.321
God...!

01:11:36.323 --> 01:11:37.723
It's just a storm.

01:11:39.726 --> 01:11:41.492
- Go away.
- Butch.

01:11:41.494 --> 01:11:43.060
Go away!

01:11:43.062 --> 01:11:45.499
Butch, calm down.
What's wrong with you?

01:11:46.499 --> 01:11:47.666
Leave us alone!

01:11:47.668 --> 01:11:49.636
Come on.

01:11:51.337 --> 01:11:53.403
Whoa. Put down the knife.
You're gonna...

01:11:53.405 --> 01:11:54.505
Everybody stay back!

01:11:54.507 --> 01:11:55.706
Whoa whoa whoa.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.477
You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:12:04.716 --> 01:12:06.552
Crazy son of a...

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:14.993
Leave me alone!

01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:18.364
Go away!

01:12:19.464 --> 01:12:21.030
Butch, don't be afraid.

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:22.467
Where do you think
you're going?

01:13:32.232 --> 01:13:34.699
Sorry to show up
so late, Nona.

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:38.503
Oh, the storm's
getting closer.

01:13:38.505 --> 01:13:40.673
I had to get out
of there, Nona.

01:13:42.474 --> 01:13:45.178
There's something really wrong
with that house.

01:13:46.245 --> 01:13:48.611
You've always known

01:13:48.613 --> 01:13:50.482
that the house is...

01:13:51.517 --> 01:13:52.615
special.

01:13:52.617 --> 01:13:55.487
But what is it
about the house?

01:13:56.553 --> 01:13:58.421
When I met your grandfather

01:13:58.423 --> 01:14:02.757
he had big ideas
and big dreams

01:14:02.759 --> 01:14:04.659
and he worked hard.

01:14:04.661 --> 01:14:08.363
When your mother was born
he took me out to Long Island.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:11.702
He was already working
two jobs.

01:14:12.836 --> 01:14:14.835
But...

01:14:14.837 --> 01:14:18.372
he scrapped together
enough money

01:14:18.374 --> 01:14:20.541
to buy a small parcel

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:23.210
in Amityville.

01:14:23.212 --> 01:14:27.249
He felt a strong
connection there, we both did.

01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:30.718
He bought the land
from a wealthy man

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.453
named Moynahan.

01:14:32.455 --> 01:14:36.690
My Michael spent the next year
building our house,

01:14:36.692 --> 01:14:38.459
your house.

01:14:38.461 --> 01:14:43.796
It was everything
he ever wanted for his family.

01:14:43.798 --> 01:14:48.434
And that's why we named it
High Hopes.

01:14:48.436 --> 01:14:52.704
Over time, we attained a life
of certain means.

01:14:52.706 --> 01:14:54.774
The house took care of us,

01:14:54.776 --> 01:14:59.279
and we took care of it,
you see?

01:14:59.281 --> 01:15:03.916
But Nona, the house,
whatever lives there,

01:15:03.918 --> 01:15:06.318
it makes things happen,

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.755
bad things.

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:10.521
Were you reading
from the book?

01:15:10.523 --> 01:15:13.725
Nona, we were just playing.

01:15:13.727 --> 01:15:15.492
Just like you taught us
when we were small.

01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:18.929
Conjoration isn't a game,
<i>bambolina.</i>

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.533
You know this.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.267
Now come on,

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.669
tell Nona everything.

01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:36.548
I'm afraid, Nona.

01:15:37.548 --> 01:15:39.918
It feels like we're being...

01:15:40.652 --> 01:15:43.285
haunted.

01:15:43.287 --> 01:15:46.556
We're all haunted
by something,

01:15:46.558 --> 01:15:48.490
by our past,

01:15:48.492 --> 01:15:50.595
by our mistakes...

01:15:51.295 --> 01:15:52.293
by our sins.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.299
Shhh.

01:15:58.301 --> 01:16:00.839
You'll be safe here
with Nona tonight.

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:01.921
Bogeyman?

01:22:53.757 --> 01:22:55.693
Where are you going, child?

01:22:56.728 --> 01:22:57.759
Home.

01:22:57.761 --> 01:22:59.863
I'm going home.

01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:03.263
It's not safe for you
out there,

01:23:03.265 --> 01:23:07.735
not tonight,
not with this storm outside.

01:23:07.737 --> 01:23:09.773
What have you done to us, Nona?

01:23:10.974 --> 01:23:12.339
They are angry.

01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:16.846
Dawn, please don't go back
to that house!

01:25:42.281 --> 01:25:43.881
Mom?

01:25:43.883 --> 01:25:45.251
Dad?

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.029
No!

01:26:07.373 --> 01:26:09.273
Oh my God!

01:26:09.275 --> 01:26:12.111
No! Allison!

01:26:13.444 --> 01:26:15.380
Allison!

01:26:20.284 --> 01:26:22.354
Oh my God.

01:26:23.988 --> 01:26:25.257
No.

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:37.231
Oh my God! Butch.

01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:40.502
What are you...?
What are you doing?

01:26:40.504 --> 01:26:44.238
Please. Butch, don't.
You have to help me.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.309
Butch, what are you doing?

01:26:48.443 --> 01:26:52.182
Please, Butch, you have to.
Please.

01:26:53.049 --> 01:26:55.048
Please stop!

01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:57.019
No!

01:26:59.387 --> 01:27:00.619
Butch, don't.

01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:02.322
Please, don't!

01:27:02.324 --> 01:27:04.556
You don't have
to do it to me.

01:27:04.558 --> 01:27:07.359
Butch! No!

01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:11.064
Please, Butch,
you don't have to do this!

01:27:11.066 --> 01:27:13.969
Stop! Butch, no!

01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:28.283
No!

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:40.624
<i>There's no way out,
Dawn...</i>

01:27:40.626 --> 01:27:43.460
- <i>I see rain...</i>
- <i>...not for any of us.</i>

01:27:43.462 --> 01:27:45.062
<i>...and blood.</i>

01:27:45.064 --> 01:27:46.530
<i>There's no way out.</i>

01:27:46.532 --> 01:27:48.464
<i>And when
it's all over...</i>

01:27:48.466 --> 01:27:50.102
<i>There's no way out.</i>

01:27:51.335 --> 01:27:54.137
<i>...I feel at peace.</i>

01:27:54.139 --> 01:27:56.038
<i>What did they used
to tell us?</i>

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.173
<i>How we would always
live here.</i>

01:27:58.175 --> 01:28:01.378
<i>There's no way out, Dawn.</i>

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.646
<i>We're all together
when it happens...</i>

01:28:04.648 --> 01:28:06.381
<i>in our safe place.</i>

01:28:06.383 --> 01:28:08.283
<i>What did they used
to tell us?</i>

01:28:08.285 --> 01:28:10.286
<i>That we would
always live here.</i>

01:28:10.288 --> 01:28:12.057
<i>...in our home.</i>

01:28:13.924 --> 01:28:16.460
<i>High Hopes.</i>

01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:42.014
Now I lay me down to sleep;

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:45.087
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep;

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:50.425
And if I die before I wake;

01:28:51.658 --> 01:28:53.993
I pray the Lord

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.131
my soul to take

01:29:09.576 --> 01:29:11.212
Dawn?

01:29:16.049 --> 01:29:17.551
Dawn?

01:29:56.619 --> 01:29:59.620
<i>Six members of a suburban
New York family</i>

01:29:59.622 --> 01:30:01.690
<i>have been found shot to death
in their beds.</i>

01:30:01.692 --> 01:30:04.291
<i>It appears that all of them
were murdered while asleep.</i>

01:30:04.293 --> 01:30:07.195
<i>The victims have been
identified as members</i>

01:30:07.197 --> 01:30:09.364
<i>of the DeFeo family.</i>

01:30:09.366 --> 01:30:13.066
<i>They were found by a 23
year old son Ronald DeFeo</i>

01:30:13.068 --> 01:30:17.206
<i>who is believed to be the only
surviving member of the family.</i>

01:32:44.611 --> 01:32:46.477
You're going
to love this one.

01:32:46.479 --> 01:32:49.213
It's a real charmer,
perfect for a new family.

01:32:49.215 --> 01:32:53.216
George and Kathy,
come on in.

01:32:53.218 --> 01:32:56.755
Let me show you how the other
half of Amityville lives.
