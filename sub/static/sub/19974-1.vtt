01:23.226 --> 01:56.004
,,

02:27.516 --> 02:29.620
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
will arrive shortly.

02:33.772 --> 02:35.869
What progress have you made,
General Votruba...

02:36.561 --> 02:38.745
in your recruiting your Czech
anti-Soviet battalion?

02:39.482 --> 02:42.758
- You know the Fuhrer counts on you.
- Yes, but it's extremely difficult...

02:43.853 --> 02:47.716
our peasants and workers are,
unfortunately very sympathetic to the Russians.

02:48.421 --> 02:52.082
Perhaps our production would increase
if our Skoda workers were allowed higher pay...

02:53.295 --> 02:55.134
since our food allowance is very low...

02:55.815 --> 02:57.562
frequently resulting in exhaustion.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.842
Admittedly, your workers may be
under paid as workers...

03:02.852 --> 03:06.387
but as an inferior race, as slaves,
they are highly over paid.

03:06.927 --> 03:08.579
Give them higher wages, you say?

03:09.170 --> 03:11.697
So they can print more of this underground propaganda?

03:16.590 --> 03:18.800
They distribute this criminal material
everyday in the Skoda plant.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.800
Every department is contaminated!

03:32.980 --> 03:36.440
Herr Excellence, the Reich Protector!

04:40.290 --> 04:42.840
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
wishes to say...

04:43.050 --> 04:45.470
that the reports from Skoda
are a putrid mess.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.760
The stinking swine at Skoda
refuse to work.

04:50.430 --> 04:55.140
In Skoda, there are 37,000 workers there.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.400
And the sabotage is out of control ...

04:58.600 --> 05:00.730
yet only 50 were executed.

05:00.940 --> 05:02.230
Why not 500?

05:02.440 --> 05:03.900
What did he say?

05:04.110 --> 05:07.780
He said "Shooting only 50 out of 37,000 is ridiculous"...

05:07.990 --> 05:11.120
he demands at least 500 lives.
The restrictions mean nothing at all.

05:11.330 --> 05:13.450
Silence!

05:16.870 --> 05:19.710
The munitions factory in Czechoslovakia ...

05:19.920 --> 05:22.130
will be put in the hands of the Gestapo.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.090
I personally, will be responsible for Skoda.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.510
If I may, your Excellence...

05:26.720 --> 05:31.850
isn't there some better way,
something not so drastic...

05:32.050 --> 05:35.640
Is this man crazy ...

05:35.850 --> 05:39.270
talking to me in this language?

05:39.480 --> 05:42.980
I insist that all Czech only speak
in German. You got that?

05:43.190 --> 05:46.400
German! German! German! German!

05:46.610 --> 05:51.780
I'll teach these sheep
at the Skoda factory to obey...

05:52.030 --> 05:54.200
not to turn to listen to
or obey traitors ever again.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.160
My car!

06:14.390 --> 06:19.230
For those who failed to understand
his Excellence's last remarks...

06:19.480 --> 06:21.270
the entire Czech armament production ...

06:21.480 --> 06:26.190
is now transferred to my authority,
under the Gestapo.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.570
The Reich Protector himself
will supervise personally...

06:29.780 --> 06:33.870
the necessary executions at the Skoda plant.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.120
To Skoda!

07:01.100 --> 07:03.100
Mrs. Dvorak!

07:03.310 --> 07:05.400
- Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.
- Good morning.

07:05.610 --> 07:07.730
I hope I can have 2 lbs. of potatoes.

07:07.980 --> 07:12.030
I'm sorry, Mrs. Novotny,
perhaps tomorrow.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.030
The turnips are nice.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.450
Well, I guess it will have to be turnips
again, and a nice head of cabbage.

07:17.660 --> 07:20.960
- Why is your motor running?
- Just waiting for my fare.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.540
You know that gasoline is
ordered not to waste?

07:23.750 --> 07:26.250
Yeah, but my battery is run down,
it won't start up again.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.510
Stop the motor!
Stop the motor!

07:31.380 --> 07:33.680
Now, start it up again.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.560
I... I guess it must have charged up.

07:39.770 --> 07:44.690
So, you carry on this sabotage trick
to use up our fuel supply.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.940
- Continue and do not stop.
- I do not know, don't understand it.

07:47.190 --> 07:50.110
- I had to crank it up this morning.
- Drive to the police precinct.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.200
- Yeah, but it never charged up...
- Forward! Forward!

08:06.500 --> 08:09.250
Vanya was arrested.
Get going, quick.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.760
Haya.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.340
Pardon me Miss, but did you see
a taxi cab waiting?

08:48.590 --> 08:50.050
Yes, a few minutes ago...

08:50.260 --> 08:53.050
but he seemed to had some trouble
with the Occupational Police.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.680
They drove off with him.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.340
Thank you.

09:11.070 --> 09:12.940
Go over there.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.410
You, look over there.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.910
Hey, Miss..

09:20.410 --> 09:23.750
A man running out from that alley.
Did you see him?

09:26.580 --> 09:27.830
Yes.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.640
In which direction did he run?

09:41.390 --> 09:43.100
This way!

09:55.150 --> 09:57.030
You better go home, now.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.700
And put it on the book.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.790
Thank you, Mrs. Dvorak.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.530
Identification cards.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.460
One, please.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.870
Heydrich been shot!

11:21.120 --> 11:24.420
Heydrich been shot!

11:25.380 --> 11:27.750
Heydrich shot!

11:27.960 --> 11:30.460
Heydrich been shot!

11:42.100 --> 11:43.640
Stop the film!

11:43.850 --> 11:44.940
Lights on!

11:45.150 --> 11:47.110
Stop the film!

11:47.980 --> 11:50.360
Who started this applause?

11:50.570 --> 11:52.320
Who started it?

11:52.530 --> 11:53.820
Answer me.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.410
No one here applauded.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.700
I demand who started this applause.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.120
The unknown soldier.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.540
Get out your identification cards.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.330
No one is permitted to leave.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.540
You stay here.
No one is permitted to leave.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.840
No one can leave!

12:11.050 --> 12:12.670
- Mister?
- What?

12:14.090 --> 12:16.470
Wait a minute, Anna,
what's the hurry?

12:16.720 --> 12:19.010
Bohemia Herald!
New race decree!

12:19.260 --> 12:20.470
Read all about it!

12:20.680 --> 12:22.640
Bohemia Herald!
New race decree!

12:22.850 --> 12:24.770
Who cares? We got the hangman!

12:31.900 --> 12:36.950
<i>State of emergency loitering forbidden,
close doors and windows.</i>

12:37.160 --> 12:39.910
<i>No loitering.
State of emergency.</i>

12:49.250 --> 12:50.290
No! No!

12:50.500 --> 12:52.380
- But I'm to stay here.
- No you can't.

12:52.630 --> 12:55.550
But why?
Because of the taxi cab driver's arrest?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.090
I don't know, orders.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.680
But I can't go home. Someone
may have recognized me.

12:59.890 --> 13:02.560
- Go to a hotel.
- But they'll check all the hotels

13:02.760 --> 13:05.600
- Where shall I go?
- I can't take you!

13:27.000 --> 13:30.750
I always dreamed of giving a my
little girl the most beautiful trousseau...

13:31.000 --> 13:34.250
But with these Germans, all the shops have been scrapped bare.

13:34.460 --> 13:39.260
But mother, I can't imagine anything
prettier. And it was yours.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.720
- All it needs is a little cutting down.
- Cutting down?

13:42.930 --> 13:45.060
Now look, Aunt Millie, I suggested it
3 months ago and everyday since.

13:45.310 --> 13:48.600
- Now there is only 2 weeks left.
- Hello, girls.

13:48.810 --> 13:50.400
- Hello father.
- Hello, Stepan.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.060
Helene.

13:52.270 --> 13:53.770
Nothing wrong, Stepan, is there?

13:53.980 --> 13:55.690
No, no, nothing at all.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.700
- Someone shot Heydrich.
- Shot Heydrich? When?

13:58.900 --> 14:01.320
- Where?
- At noon on Kladno Avenue...

14:01.530 --> 14:04.620
what we now must call "Ludendorf Street".

14:05.120 --> 14:07.250
It's all in the paper there.

14:08.410 --> 14:09.870
Father.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.670
Yes?

14:11.920 --> 14:14.880
I think I must have seen him.
The man who shot...

14:20.510 --> 14:22.260
Close the door.

14:25.010 --> 14:27.720
- I'm sure I saw him.
- You haven't seen anyone.

14:27.930 --> 14:31.560
- I'm certain I have.
- You haven't seen anyone!

14:31.770 --> 14:33.900
Father, you don't have any connection...

14:34.110 --> 14:39.780
No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically
disconnected for over 15 years now.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.950
It's best in such matters, one doesn't talk.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.950
Example: You tell it to A...

14:46.160 --> 14:49.450
A entrust it to B,
B confines in C...

14:49.660 --> 14:54.790
C reposes the secret to D and it's
not very far from E or F.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.170
F reports it G
and G stands for Gestapo.

14:59.380 --> 15:02.220
Yes, I understand. But to you father...

15:02.430 --> 15:05.220
Listen, come here, come here. Look.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.480
Here.

15:11.690 --> 15:13.480
Definition of "No one"...

15:13.690 --> 15:17.650
"not any, not one, not a single one, none!"

15:17.900 --> 15:20.690
Not to me, not to your mother
not to your little brother...

15:20.900 --> 15:24.740
not even to your fiance, Jan.
No one is "no one"!

15:25.200 --> 15:30.580
Look, I've had that old battery for 5 years.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.870
It's full of quarks!

15:32.080 --> 15:34.580
There is some quarks to the tags, also.

15:34.790 --> 15:38.340
According to the Gestapo, they belong to a car that was burned...

15:38.550 --> 15:40.590
last October.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.680
- Is that the late paper?
- Yep.

15:45.890 --> 15:47.390
Can I look at it?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.310
Yep.

16:01.813 --> 16:03.000
Your cab was a getaway car!

16:05.895 --> 16:07.250
I don't know nothing about it.

16:07.660 --> 16:10.080
You will talk to the Gestapo.

16:32.930 --> 16:34.770
Attention!

16:38.190 --> 16:40.770
"By order of the Occupational Police...

16:40.980 --> 16:42.610
"all restaurants, cafes,
theaters...

16:42.820 --> 16:44.940
"and public buildings will
close immediately.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.360
"Curfew, 7:00 O'clock, sharp.

16:47.570 --> 16:51.780
"After this hour, any person on the
street will be shot on sight."

16:56.500 --> 16:59.210
- He must have gotten over the border.
- There are no borders anymore.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.170
The trains are all stopped,
the frontier closed.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.130
If he only got out of Prague,
that's all I want.

17:04.339 --> 17:07.089
- It looks like they're in a awful sweat.
- You bet.

17:11.260 --> 17:14.349
Excuse me, we have to close now.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.980
Thank you, sir.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.610
There must be some other way than assassination.

17:29.820 --> 17:32.950
What will be the result?
More terror, more bloodshed.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.080
It will be like the student massacre
at the university

17:35.290 --> 17:39.040
But Jan, those 120 boys gave their
lives to tell the world...

17:39.250 --> 17:42.380
that we are still Czech.
That we will always be Czech.

17:42.580 --> 17:45.380
- Yes, I agree on that...
- At least

17:45.590 --> 17:46.590
Shush, Beda.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.050
Say, what is the specific gravity
of phosphorus, future brother-in-law?

17:51.470 --> 17:53.680
I haven't the faintest idea.

17:54.010 --> 17:55.510
You've got me there, Beda,
I don't know.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.140
But you're a chemists, you ought
to know it by heart.

17:58.350 --> 18:00.140
Well, Jan?

18:00.350 --> 18:02.560
Yes, let me see now...

18:02.770 --> 18:04.440
specific...

18:05.190 --> 18:07.150
Uh ah, as a chemists, I only have to
know where to look it up.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.820
You have to know it by heart,
future brother-in-law.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.320
Jan, you have to hurry if you're
to be home before curfew.

18:13.530 --> 18:16.910
Beda, go to the kitchen and tell Auntie
to wrap something up for Jan to eat.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.410
With all the restaurants closed tonight,
you'll simply starve.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.410
Well, thank you very much Mrs. Novotny.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.290
- I'll say good night then.
- Good night, Jan.

18:24.830 --> 18:25.960
Come.

18:27.590 --> 18:30.670
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.470
Good night, darling.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.680
Good night.

18:53.570 --> 18:55.700
I got your name from the florist
across the street.

18:55.910 --> 18:59.162
<i>Mascha, is someone there?</i>

18:59.621 --> 19:00.751
Is nowhere else I can go!

19:00.951 --> 19:02.689
<i>- Mascha.</i>
- Yes, Auntie.

19:02.889 --> 19:05.027
No, no, there's no one.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.290
You helped me once before,
Miss Novotny.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.800
- Yes, but...
<i>- Mascha!</i>

19:10.000 --> 19:11.340
Coming, Auntie.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.590
Come in quick.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.430
In here.

19:18.850 --> 19:21.000
Put your book away, Beda,
it's almost dinner time.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.230
<i>Yes, mother.</i>

19:27.900 --> 19:29.650
Hello.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.950
What beautiful roses!

19:35.160 --> 19:39.530
Mascha, aren't you going
to introduce me?

19:39.740 --> 19:42.200
Yes, of course. Mister...

19:42.410 --> 19:46.500
- Karel Vanek.
- Won't you please come in, Mr. Vanek?

19:48.750 --> 19:50.210
Come.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.420
Stepan...

19:51.630 --> 19:55.340
Father, I want you to met a friend,
Mr. Vanek.

19:55.550 --> 19:57.720
- Your daughter and I met...
- At the symphony.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.640
My father, Professor Novotny.

20:00.850 --> 20:03.100
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

20:03.310 --> 20:06.850
I had the honor of being introduced
to your daughter at intermission.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.900
I had the score of the symphony with me.

20:09.110 --> 20:10.980
Oh, are you a musician, Mr. Vanek?

20:11.190 --> 20:14.150
No, only a amateur.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.490
I happen to be an architect.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.410
I almost went along with
Mascha that evening...

20:19.620 --> 20:21.660
only at the last minute,
I don't feel too well.

20:21.870 --> 20:25.330
Oh, that's too bad,
but than again...

20:25.540 --> 20:27.330
I wouldn't have had the pleasure of
escorting your daughter home.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.880
Oh, then you live in this district,
Mr. Vanek?

20:30.080 --> 20:34.340
No... no, I just happen to be
in the neighborhood.

20:34.550 --> 20:37.110
Thought I would drop by
and pay my respects.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.540
Young man, did you realize
it was already after 7 o'clock?

20:39.640 --> 20:40.704
I have 6:30.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.640
The correct time is 7:15. Your watch
must be slow, Mr. Vanek...

20:46.850 --> 20:50.310
And tonight,
that might be dangerous.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.480
Yes, I suppose I better run along.

20:53.690 --> 20:56.570
If you're on the street after 7 o'clock,
they shoot you on sight.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.740
Right, father...

20:58.918 --> 21:00.192
Dinner is ready, lady.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.040
You mustn't think of leaving.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.540
- Millie, set another place, please.
- Yes.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.870
Luckily Mr. Vanek, we prepared
for another guest this evening.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.710
You will join us for dinner,
won't you?

21:15.260 --> 21:17.630
I hardly know what to say...

21:18.550 --> 21:21.890
Don't say anything, Mr. Vanek,
it's quite unnecessary.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.430
Isn't it, Mascha?

21:32.020 --> 21:34.230
Don't be deceived by this china,
Mr. Vanek.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.990
- Turnips again.
- And cabbage.

21:37.190 --> 21:39.160
My husband likes for me
to use this service...

21:39.360 --> 21:41.740
just to retain the memory
of the good old days.

21:41.950 --> 21:43.200
Let me correct you, Helene.

21:43.410 --> 21:45.120
Not in memory of the good old days...

21:45.330 --> 21:47.500
but of the bad new ones.

21:47.710 --> 21:49.000
That is a meat platter.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.460
It contains cabbage.
It should contain meat.

21:51.670 --> 21:54.210
That's why I insist it should be
on the table before us.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.380
I agree with you,
Professor Novotny.

21:56.590 --> 21:59.550
What do you think of the shooting
of Heydrich, Mr. Vanek?

21:59.760 --> 22:03.100
It was completely unexpected,
wasn't it?

22:03.390 --> 22:06.270
It was rather inevitable,
don't you think, Mr. Vanek?

22:06.970 --> 22:08.850
Yes.

22:09.140 --> 22:12.230
Well, we're all very glad that
he managed to escape.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.650
I'll see who it is.

22:29.750 --> 22:32.750
- It was Mrs. Sacha.
- Our janitor.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.380
All males over the age of 13...

22:35.590 --> 22:39.170
must register with the police
before tomorrow night.

22:39.590 --> 22:42.180
Anyone without a police card
will be shot.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.800
That leaves you out, Beda.

22:44.010 --> 22:46.350
Apparently they don't think much
of Czech boys over 11.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.140
Alright. Let them think that.

22:50.140 --> 22:53.060
There may be some news on the radio.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.270
Possibly.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.360
Beda, you can take a recess from that
cabbage and turn on the radio.

22:57.570 --> 22:59.990
Yes, sir.
Thanks.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.410
Beda, you have hardly touched your food.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.740
I prefer bread.

23:07.030 --> 23:10.080
Careful, that's an ersatz,
it mustn't be...

23:10.290 --> 23:15.880
- Oh, I knew it.
- Poor Beda.

23:17.380 --> 23:19.710
"Fight on, my merry men all...

23:19.920 --> 23:23.180
"I'm a little wounded, but I'm not slain".

23:23.720 --> 23:27.010
It's nothing, I'm all right.
I'll be alright mother.

23:27.350 --> 23:29.720
- I think it will need stitches.
- May I see it, Beda?

23:29.930 --> 23:32.810
- Let's go and, put it under the faucet.
- No, Auntie.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.310
I don't think it will need stitches,
Mrs. Novotny.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.020
If you have a bit of bandage, a little
cotton, and some iodine...

23:39.230 --> 23:42.110
- It's bleeding though.
- I think we can stop that.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.700
Alright, Beda.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.160
Can you hold that please? Twist it.

23:48.410 --> 23:50.370
<i>We interrupt our program to give
you the latest order...</i>

23:50.580 --> 23:51.790
<i>of the Occupational Authority.</i>

23:52.000 --> 23:55.830
<i>Any person aiding the escape of the
assassination or providing him with shelter...</i>

23:56.040 --> 23:57.290
<i>will be executed.</i>

23:57.500 --> 23:59.300
<i>All relatives of such accomplishes...</i>

23:59.550 --> 24:02.210
<i>are subject to the same penalty of death.</i>

24:02.420 --> 24:05.090
<i>The population is hereby warned
to report any information...</i>

24:05.300 --> 24:07.340
<i>leading to the assassin at once."</i>

24:07.550 --> 24:10.640
<i>Anyone with holding such information
must reckon with the blood debt...</i>

24:10.850 --> 24:14.690
<i>this monstrous crime has laid upon the entire Czech nation...</i>

24:14.890 --> 24:18.270
Those geniuses up there think they
can intimidate the Czechs...

24:18.480 --> 24:21.070
with public warnings, dopes.

24:23.820 --> 24:28.030
They will need something more concrete
to surrender their beloved assassin.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.910
Something to make them jump.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.920
- Czaka!
- What?

24:36.460 --> 24:38.670
Are you listening to me at all?

24:38.880 --> 24:41.000
I beg your pardon?

24:42.130 --> 24:44.170
What are you doing there?

24:44.420 --> 24:46.470
Nothing.

24:48.220 --> 24:52.180
File C. Yes, that's right.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.480
Czaka is spelled with a "C".

24:55.770 --> 24:57.560
Curious, aren't you?

24:57.770 --> 24:59.520
Curious on what the Gestapo
may have ...

24:59.730 --> 25:02.320
on file on the honorable brewer Czaka.

25:02.530 --> 25:06.650
I will tell you: "His beer is good."
Salute!

25:12.120 --> 25:14.120
But he, himself, rather stinks.

25:14.330 --> 25:16.580
: Right. I hope you're
at home this weekend.

25:16.790 --> 25:19.380
- You're a smart ass.
- Don't talk German to me.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.960
If I'm going to police your
fascinating people properly...

25:22.170 --> 25:24.880
I have to learn your crazy
language to perfection.

25:25.130 --> 25:27.630
Here is the first list, Herr Inspector.

25:41.650 --> 25:43.320
Editor...

25:43.520 --> 25:45.230
Railway worker...

25:45.480 --> 25:46.940
Clergyman.

25:47.150 --> 25:50.030
That's good.
Priest are always good.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.740
They do more harm than anyone else...

25:52.950 --> 25:54.950
offending in every sermon.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.040
Listen, I have a good suggestion.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.710
Nykvar, the poet.

25:58.910 --> 26:00.420
Nykvar?

26:00.620 --> 26:02.840
What for?
He is not political.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.800
He only writes folk ballads,
children' poems, fables.

26:06.050 --> 26:09.550
Herr Gruber, if it's your intention to
Germanize the protectorate...

26:09.760 --> 26:13.350
that is exactly where you should begin,
with the children.

26:16.310 --> 26:19.230
You're an extraordinary patriot, Czaka.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.830
I'm sorry, professor...

26:42.040 --> 26:45.290
do you think I might ask the janitoress if
there is an available room here...

26:45.500 --> 26:47.710
in the house where I might stay over?

26:47.920 --> 26:49.550
I happen to know there's nothing.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.470
There is an available couch in my study...

26:51.680 --> 26:53.800
That I can personally assure you
is not uncomfortable.

26:54.050 --> 26:56.680
It has already been made up.
You're welcomed to it.

26:57.770 --> 26:59.560
Very kind of you,
but...

26:59.770 --> 27:03.230
There is hardly an alternative,
is there Mr. Vanek?

27:03.730 --> 27:07.070
I hope those chimes
don't keep you awake.

27:08.570 --> 27:10.950
Wenceslas hymn?

27:11.150 --> 27:14.370
I should be use to it.
I hear it every morning.

27:14.780 --> 27:18.580
What funny times. A man meets my
daughter at a symphony concert once ...

27:18.830 --> 27:20.700
and the next week he moves in.

27:20.910 --> 27:24.500
Do you think the neighbors might gossip?
What of Jan?

27:24.710 --> 27:29.630
- I don't see why the neighbors should hear of it at all.
- Well, the janitoress knows.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.340
She does?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.630
Yes.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.260
Who told her?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.680
We have our breakfast quite early,
Mr. Vanek.

27:40.890 --> 27:44.730
Since it's forbidden to lecture
at the university any longer...

27:44.940 --> 27:48.520
some of my former students come here
to continue their studies.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.690
-  Good night, monkey.
- Professor, I must speak with you.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.570
You have to excuse me.

27:52.820 --> 27:56.740
and a old fellow like me can't
keep up with you younger men.

27:56.950 --> 27:59.330
Good night, Mr. Vanek,
I hope you rest well.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.160
Good night, monkey.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.960
Good night, father.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.710
You don't need to tell him anything,
he knows.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.880
You told him?

28:14.090 --> 28:16.470
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't let me.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.850
Father is an old revolutionary.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.930
He was in exiled with the
founders of the Republic.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.450
<i>British broadcasting...</i>

28:38.660 --> 28:43.080
<i>The Czech government in exile here
informs that the daring execution...</i>

28:43.290 --> 28:48.830
<i>of the hangman Heydrich is expected to
be followed by a nationwide bloodbath...</i>

28:49.040 --> 28:52.800
<i>as savage as only the
Nazi barbarians can be.</i>

28:54.210 --> 28:55.620
This woman who lead our men
the wrong way...

28:55.960 --> 28:59.670
must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.720
Maybe, but I don't know her name.

29:06.770 --> 29:09.150
Pick it up, again.

29:22.370 --> 29:25.750
There, put it back in place.

29:26.870 --> 29:27.910
Good.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.330
You say you never learned
where the girl lives?

29:31.540 --> 29:34.090
- No.
- Here is the coffee, Herr Ritter.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.260
Thank you very much.

29:37.010 --> 29:39.050
Real coffee.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.600
Now, Mrs. Dvorak,
let's start from the beginning.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.480
Now, don't be nervous, Mrs. Dvorak.

29:47.680 --> 29:51.190
I am prepared to devote to you
all of tonight...

29:52.860 --> 29:55.360
even longer, if necessary.

29:56.570 --> 29:58.900
Well?

30:07.580 --> 30:09.660
That's the girl.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.340
I want you to listen to me very closely,
Mrs. Dvorak.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.880
Do you realize where you are?

30:20.130 --> 30:21.760
Yes.

30:22.010 --> 30:25.180
And exactly,
where are you?

30:27.270 --> 30:28.720
Gestapo.

30:28.930 --> 30:33.020
And you actually believe you will walk
out of here without telling us the truth?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.910
Now.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.660
This girl...

30:48.370 --> 30:51.250
who sent our men the wrong way...

30:51.460 --> 30:55.380
she must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.720
<i>It is now 8 a.m.
Last night the Fuhrer's own physician...</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:03.800
<i>performed an extremely delicate
operation on the spinal cord...</i>

31:04.010 --> 31:06.430
<i>on his excellency the Reich Protector...</i>

31:06.640 --> 31:09.270
<i>removing 3 pistol bullets.</i>

31:11.100 --> 31:14.940
- Anything?
- No. Nothing yet.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.230
Here.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.400
Several people have been arrested.

31:22.650 --> 31:25.620
It is reliably reported that the
Gestapo have a definite clue...

31:25.820 --> 31:28.620
- that will lead directly to the assassin.
- The taxi driver.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.910
- No, no.
- But, who else?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.210
I don't know.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.460
I must leave at once.

31:35.670 --> 31:38.630
<i>An important announcement from
the Occupational Authorities.</i>

31:39.050 --> 31:41.130
<i>Taking personal charge...</i>

31:41.340 --> 31:42.760
<i>the chief of the Gestapo from Prague...</i>

31:42.970 --> 31:45.550
<i>Kurt Haas, has ordered instant retaliation...</i>

31:45.760 --> 31:48.550
<i>for the insufficient cooperation of the civilian population.</i>

31:48.760 --> 31:51.470
<i>Most severe methods are to be expected.</i>

31:54.060 --> 31:55.730
They know nothing.

31:55.940 --> 31:59.190
If they did, they would not threaten.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.730
Miss Novotny.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.570
Open up!

32:09.950 --> 32:12.620
Come with me. You, stay here.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.210
Who are you?
What's your name?

32:19.420 --> 32:22.130
- Karel Vanek.
- You live in this house?

32:23.710 --> 32:25.670
Who are you?

32:26.090 --> 32:29.010
I am Professor Novotny.
Whom are you looking for?

32:29.220 --> 32:31.100
- For you!
- No!

32:31.300 --> 32:34.020
Quiet, no interference!

32:34.390 --> 32:36.600
On what grounds?

32:37.440 --> 32:40.230
For the loathsome abominable
crime committed  against..

32:40.440 --> 32:45.900
the person of the
Reich Protector. And the refusal...

32:46.110 --> 32:48.740
of Czechs who resist
to cooperate with us.

32:48.990 --> 32:50.030
Who shall be held hostage until the killer...

32:50.280 --> 32:53.120
is delivered to the authority.

32:53.410 --> 32:55.000
And what if he is not surrendered?

32:55.250 --> 32:58.040
This response is from the Occupation Authority.

33:00.580 --> 33:05.760
If I understand you correctly, and for the
benefit of my family and students...

33:06.010 --> 33:07.880
the loathsome abominable crime...

33:08.090 --> 33:11.470
comitted against his excellency,
the Reich Protector...

33:11.720 --> 33:14.180
or more correctly, the unheard of...

33:14.390 --> 33:17.850
traitorous behavior of my countrymen...

33:18.060 --> 33:22.810
in failing to cooperate wholeheartedly 
with their "German protectors"...

33:23.020 --> 33:25.070
compels you to hold me hostage...

33:25.280 --> 33:29.070
together with others in whom, I presume,
until the assassin is surrendered..

33:29.320 --> 33:31.950
our lives becoming forfeit for his?

33:32.160 --> 33:33.740
- I believe that is correct?
- Correct

33:34.080 --> 33:37.370
- Father, no. They can't...
- Oh yes, they can.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.870
They can arrest me,
they can arrest a hundred more.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.960
Indeed, they can arrest as many hundreds
as they have on their lists.

33:45.340 --> 33:49.050
But I don't believe they will find
one single traitor among us.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.300
- Or in all of the Czech nation.
- Who are you and all these others?

33:52.510 --> 33:54.970
Some of my former students.
I give them private tutoring.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.180
Or is that forbidden too?

33:56.390 --> 34:00.440
Keep your mouth shut, or you'll get some
real tutoring. Make yourself ready.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.690
How can you take my husband for
something he knows nothing about?

34:02.900 --> 34:04.610
No interruptions!

34:04.810 --> 34:07.030
- Ludmilla.
- Yes?

34:07.230 --> 34:10.320
Will you get some of my things ready?
Just a few for tonight.

34:10.530 --> 34:11.570
Yes.

34:11.780 --> 34:14.159
No razors are permitted.

34:16.489 --> 34:19.449
I trust you will all continue
with your studies?

34:19.830 --> 34:23.380
Don't let yourself be snowed
under at Valley Forge.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.550
Father!

34:29.840 --> 34:31.590
Good luck.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.340
- Thank you.
- Now please go.

34:35.219 --> 34:36.560
All of you.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.310
- Stepan, I'm frighten.
- I know, I know

34:41.520 --> 34:43.560
Monkey.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.230
Thank you, sister.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.070
Goodbye, son.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.530
Remember all this, well.

34:53.739 --> 34:55.659
I will.

35:03.580 --> 35:05.420
I'm ready.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.630
Vystyd, Priest

35:13.800 --> 35:16.600
Votruba, General.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.770
Pravotka, Jew.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.020
Necval, Writer.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.150
Schyler, Clerk.

35:33.740 --> 35:37.030
Matouseck, Worker.

35:39.410 --> 35:41.290
Attention!

35:45.870 --> 35:48.170
Who is the oldest?

35:49.670 --> 35:52.460
All men over 50 raise your arms.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.970
You, your name.

35:57.430 --> 35:59.100
Professor Stepan Novotny.

35:59.350 --> 36:01.720
Stand at attention when you address me!

36:02.680 --> 36:06.560
Novotny, you're in charge
of this barracks.

36:06.770 --> 36:10.440
Will be completely responsible for
compliance with camp regulations.

36:10.860 --> 36:13.440
Base cleanliness must be maintained.

36:13.650 --> 36:16.240
No spit or dirt on the floor.

36:16.450 --> 36:20.490
All shoe laces, suspenders,
neck ties, and belts...

36:20.700 --> 36:23.250
must be turned into to the
commandant's office within one hour.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.790
Understood?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.370
Don't shake your head, speak!

36:28.120 --> 36:32.300
Father should have dressed more warmly.
Because it is damp and cold out there.

36:34.670 --> 36:38.010
The assassin must give himself up,
or he's a monster.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.930
If I knew who he was,
I'd go out and tell the police.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.930
- Anyone in Prague should.
- Aunt Millie, it's not as simple as that.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.230
- Why not?
- Whoever help him...

36:47.430 --> 36:49.810
can't go to the Gestapo
after last nights broadcast

36:50.020 --> 36:53.900
It would be like signing his own death
warrant. Him and his whole family.

36:54.110 --> 36:55.860
Any one who knows...

36:56.110 --> 36:59.650
and helps him,
is as guilty as the assassin.

37:00.070 --> 37:01.820
Mascha!

37:02.240 --> 37:05.540
Jan, look after Mascha.

37:06.580 --> 37:08.200
Mascha, is there something I can do?

37:08.450 --> 37:10.500
There is only one hope...

37:10.790 --> 37:13.290
that he gives himself up.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.750
Yes, I'm afraid so.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.380
Oh darling, I'm sorry, but ...

37:18.720 --> 37:20.430
I have to get back to the lab.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.140
Yes.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.260
Funny, when I left you last night...

37:25.470 --> 37:29.850
I met a chap coming up the stairs
with some red roses.

37:30.480 --> 37:36.110
Oh yes, the florist sent
them to my mother.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.940
She is one of his old customers.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.910
I'll see who it is.

37:48.450 --> 37:50.830
- Beda!
- They called off the school for the whole week.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.500
They said on account of Heydrich...

37:52.710 --> 37:56.170
But I heard they are using the rooms for
the wounded from Russian battles.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.630
- How about father?
- Nothing yet.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.510
Mascha, if you hear anything be sure
to let me know.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.880
- I will, Jan, and goodbye darling.
- Good bye.

38:02.090 --> 38:03.800
- Good bye, Jan.
- Good bye, Beda.

38:04.680 --> 38:08.970
- Beda, your bandage is all filthy.
- It isn't filthy, it's just a little tangled.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.350
- I'll fix it.
- No, I better do it. Come with me.

38:17.070 --> 38:21.150
You ought to take lessons from Mr. Vanek.
He's an expert at bandaging.

38:36.860 --> 38:38.900
You're next, Mr. Dedic.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.740
Good afternoon, doctor.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.910
Good afternoon.

38:50.210 --> 38:52.210
His case history, doctor.

38:53.420 --> 38:55.090
How's everything going?

38:55.290 --> 39:00.090
Yesterday I was afraid of complications,
but today it's been pretty good.

39:04.600 --> 39:07.810
- Here are the bandages, doctor.
- Thank you. That's all.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.450
I took two sedatives.
Look at that

39:25.660 --> 39:28.490
Naturally, anyone who has been
through your last 24 hrs

39:28.700 --> 39:31.120
Yesterday, when Vanya was arrested,
it looked pretty serious

39:31.330 --> 39:33.670
So we had to leave you on your own.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.130
- I understood.
- You did a great job, Svoboda.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.760
Now they let lose their
horrible bloodbath.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.800
Yes.

39:42.010 --> 39:44.550
They've already sized over 400 hostages.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.470
We anticipated hostages.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.060
Yes.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.440
Yes, we did,
didn't we?

39:56.860 --> 40:02.030
I spent last night with the family
of Professor Novotny, the historian.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.030
No...

40:04.240 --> 40:06.120
No previous acquaintance.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.280
His daughter helped me.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.410
She directed the black shirts the wrong way.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.160
This morning...

40:16.040 --> 40:17.670
Dedic...

40:17.880 --> 40:19.460
I've decided to give myself up.

40:19.670 --> 40:23.170
- Svoboda!
- Oh, I'm not trying to make any noble gestures.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.430
Or become a heroic martyr...

40:26.640 --> 40:29.220
But 400 lives...

40:29.470 --> 40:31.640
Four hundred?

40:31.850 --> 40:34.060
Dedic, I'm only one, only one.

40:34.270 --> 40:36.520
Have you thought about what must be
done to drive the Germans out?

40:36.730 --> 40:40.270
You'll be needed, Svoboda.
You have no right to surrender.

40:42.150 --> 40:43.940
Don't worry...

40:44.150 --> 40:47.870
They won't torture any information
out of me.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.160
All they'll get is my dead body...

40:50.370 --> 40:53.080
a written confession and the evidence.

40:53.290 --> 40:56.830
The bullets they remove from Heydrich
will give them that.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.920
The gun will be absolute proof.

41:00.170 --> 41:01.670
No...

41:01.880 --> 41:03.260
the underground has nothing to fear.

41:03.510 --> 41:04.880
But it has, Svoboda.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.220
Listen, you're an physician.

41:07.470 --> 41:09.550
If a man showing your symptoms
came into your clinic...

41:09.800 --> 41:13.100
wouldn't you diagnose his case
as nerves shot to pieces...

41:13.350 --> 41:15.730
hysteria cause by exhaustion?

41:15.930 --> 41:17.350
Would you advise a patient in that state...

41:17.560 --> 41:21.060
to make an irrevocable decision?
You would not!

41:22.400 --> 41:26.240
Svoboda, you were chosen to act as
a representative of the Czech people.

41:26.450 --> 41:29.490
The Czech people have executed "the Hangman".

41:29.740 --> 41:33.290
400 lives! Yes, Svoboda,
What is 400 lives?

41:33.490 --> 41:35.450
This is a war of millions...

41:35.660 --> 41:39.000
and the execution of Heydrich is only one battle in that war.

41:39.210 --> 41:40.960
But a most important one.

41:41.170 --> 41:43.750
And if you surrender yourself,
alive or dead...

41:44.000 --> 41:46.260
The Czech people will have lost that battle.

41:46.510 --> 41:49.220
Every Czech person will say to themselves:
"We dare not resist!"

41:49.470 --> 41:52.180
"The Nazi terrorist is too much for us!"

41:52.600 --> 41:54.220
Svoboda...

41:54.470 --> 41:58.020
three years ago we lost our army.

41:58.230 --> 42:01.650
We stood on the streets crying like
children and watched it surrender.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.610
So we built a new one...

42:03.820 --> 42:07.860
A ghost army that will haunt them
until their blood runs cold!

42:08.070 --> 42:11.910
Now, you would have this
army surrender too?

42:29.180 --> 42:33.680
What about this Novotny family?
I take it you were sufficiently cautious?

42:34.010 --> 42:36.600
They know nothing of me.

42:36.890 --> 42:40.230
I used the name of Vanek,
told them I was an architect.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.350
You're sure you didn't leave no clues
to your real identity...

42:42.560 --> 42:46.690
- positive connecting link?
- None, I'm sure.

42:48.150 --> 42:50.030
Dedic...

42:51.490 --> 42:53.530
what about the taxi driver?

42:53.740 --> 42:57.370
Jumped out of the window at the
Gestapo. They got nothing from him

42:59.460 --> 43:01.670
I never met the man.

43:02.460 --> 43:04.540
I wish I had.

43:05.340 --> 43:07.920
You better let me have that gun.

43:10.090 --> 43:11.260
You have a fool proof alibi...

43:11.470 --> 43:15.140
but with that gun and those bullets there,
they would chew that apart.

43:34.150 --> 43:36.200
One moment.

43:36.410 --> 43:38.820
You forgot your prescription.

43:54.510 --> 43:56.010
Miss Novotny.

44:03.270 --> 44:06.640
Dr. Svoboda,
may I talk to you alone?

44:07.060 --> 44:09.610
Nurse, please.

44:11.270 --> 44:13.280
What are you going to do?

44:14.900 --> 44:16.820
How did you happen to find me?

44:18.280 --> 44:20.280
That's not important.

44:20.570 --> 44:24.370
It was Beda, it was your bandage
that gave me the idea you were a physician.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.870
You said you hear the
Wenceslau hymn every morning.

44:27.080 --> 44:31.040
So, when I noticed this hospital
across from the church...

44:31.710 --> 44:34.760
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.550
Nothing?

44:36.760 --> 44:38.180
Last night you spoke differently...

44:38.380 --> 44:41.050
when it was your life in danger.
Now you think you're safe.

44:41.260 --> 44:44.220
So now it's nothing,
nothing to be done?

44:44.430 --> 44:47.850
Dr. Svoboda, you're the only one
who can save my father.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.770
What are you going to do?

44:49.980 --> 44:53.230
I can not surrender to the Germans,
if that is what you mean.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.190
But they will kill him for what you did!

44:55.400 --> 44:57.570
- Let me explain.
- Alright, explain.

44:57.780 --> 44:59.990
Explain why the man who helped you
was taken away to his death...

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
while you stood there silent.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.540
But don't think I will be silent,
I tell you, I won't!

45:04.740 --> 45:06.950
I won't let you kill my father,
because I won't!

45:07.160 --> 45:11.000
Miss Novotny, consider what possible benefit...

45:11.210 --> 45:14.250
it could do your father,
for whom I have the deepest admiration...

45:14.500 --> 45:16.840
if you denounce me.

45:17.050 --> 45:20.811
- You would involve your entire family.
- You were counting on that, weren't you?

45:21.011 --> 45:23.390
You think you have control over me
because we helped you.

45:24.760 --> 45:29.850
This is not a threat, but a simple fact.
One you must not forget.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.850
You have it all nicely worked out.

45:33.100 --> 45:36.020
If I tell them, then all my
family will be shot.

45:36.230 --> 45:39.570
If I keep silent,
only my father will be shot.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.570
In other words,
you simple statement of fact is...

45:41.780 --> 45:46.030
we are lost in any case because we were
generous enough to save your life.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.000
You're just a cold blooded coward.
You are no better than Heydrich, himself.

45:49.250 --> 45:52.500
Even the Gestapo couldn't be as
inhuman as you are!

46:12.770 --> 46:14.850
- Petschek Bank.
- Gestapo headquarters?

46:15.060 --> 46:16.440
- Yes, quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.

46:16.650 --> 46:18.650
Hurry, please.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.170
Driver!

46:44.550 --> 46:46.680
Driver!
Driver!

46:47.180 --> 46:48.760
Driver! Can't you hear me?

46:49.140 --> 46:52.390
You're going the wrong way.
Stop!

46:55.980 --> 46:58.400
- Who are you?
- Miss Novotny, you must be out of your mind.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.150
- Do you know what you're doing at all?
- Stop, driver.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.320
I have no time now to give you a
lecture on political principles.

47:02.530 --> 47:03.990
Haven't you any idea what is
going on here?

47:04.200 --> 47:06.660
- This is war, and you're in it.
- Who are you, and where are you taking me too?

47:06.910 --> 47:08.490
Don't be frightened,
we aren't taking you anywhere.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.740
We just want to explain to you...

47:10.950 --> 47:15.210
<i>- Help, let me out please!
- What going on here?</i>

47:15.420 --> 47:17.630
This driver took me the wrong way here, but I told him...

47:17.830 --> 47:20.340
- Where do you want to go, Miss?
- To the Gestapo.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.340
<i>Gestapo?</i>

47:25.430 --> 47:27.390
But he drove the other way...

47:27.590 --> 47:29.600
then this strange man...

47:29.800 --> 47:32.220
<i>Strange man?</i>

47:32.430 --> 47:32.955
Where is he?

47:33.155 --> 47:35.560
I don't know what she is talking about,
so help me.

47:35.810 --> 47:39.230
I didn't hear the little lady at all.
I'm hard of hearing...

47:39.440 --> 47:42.360
getting pushed around by the tweezers.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.780
Alright, you're blocking traffic,
you better keep moving.

47:50.740 --> 47:54.330
Why did you want to go to the Gestapo?
Did they send for you?

47:54.540 --> 47:58.000
- Com'on baby, tell us.
- Com'on, out with it.

47:58.210 --> 47:59.920
No, No...

48:00.170 --> 48:04.010
Well, if they didn't send for you, what
business have you got with those butchers?

48:04.880 --> 48:07.720
What does a decent Czech girl want
with the Gestapo anyway?

48:07.930 --> 48:11.600
Who are you squealing on you
little Judas? That poor driver?

48:11.810 --> 48:13.890
What did he do to you, huh?

48:17.690 --> 48:19.770
The Gestapo!

48:30.410 --> 48:33.200
- No, don't let them.
- You needn't be afraid, Miss

48:33.410 --> 48:36.200
- You wanted to be taken to the Gestapo?
- Yes.

48:36.410 --> 48:39.620
Have you received a summons, or do
you wish to make a statement?

48:39.830 --> 48:41.290
I haven't received any summons.

48:41.500 --> 48:44.420
Alright miss, you will be taken to
the headquarters safely.

49:03.020 --> 49:05.230
Mascha Novotny,
for Inspector Ritter.

49:05.440 --> 49:08.690
Here is your pass, Miss Novotny.
Heil, Hitler.

49:08.940 --> 49:11.240
Miss Novotny,
it will be a few minutes.

49:14.030 --> 49:16.740
Perhaps I might go to the washroom?

49:16.950 --> 49:18.660
My cheek is bleeding again.

49:18.870 --> 49:21.620
Right across the corridor,
first door to the left.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.890
Your pass, miss??

49:42.690 --> 49:44.440
Over there.

49:45.230 --> 49:47.110
Your pass?

49:49.230 --> 49:51.360
You've been to Herr Ritter's office?

49:51.570 --> 49:54.200
- Yes.
- And you have already made your statement?

49:54.410 --> 49:56.070
Yes.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.740
That's strange.

49:57.950 --> 50:00.540
That pass should be
signed and stamped.

50:00.790 --> 50:04.670
- There must have been should kind of mistake.
- We don't make mistakes here!

50:05.630 --> 50:08.710
My father had nothing to do
with the shooting yesterday.

50:08.960 --> 50:12.510
He was doing research at the library
all day.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.470
You can easily get proof.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.810
- And this is the statement you came to make?
- Yes.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.560
But I understood only a few minutes ago...

50:26.150 --> 50:27.900
you wanted to leave...

50:28.110 --> 50:32.650
without the benefit of this
extremely valuable testimony.

50:34.610 --> 50:37.530
We are very grateful to you...

50:37.740 --> 50:40.040
for not leaving us.

50:40.830 --> 50:42.370
Just wait a minute.

50:43.750 --> 50:46.130
First she tried to break out
without seeing me.

50:46.330 --> 50:49.960
Now she would have us believe she came
only to have her father released.

50:50.170 --> 50:52.920
- Bunk!
- What does she look like?

50:53.130 --> 50:55.260
Young, quite attractive...

50:55.510 --> 50:57.930
brown eyes, about 22, I would say.

50:58.140 --> 51:01.010
Burnett, 5ft 4?

51:01.220 --> 51:03.560
Yes!

51:13.740 --> 51:16.990
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long,
Miss Novotny.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.370
It's too bad for us,
you see.

51:19.580 --> 51:22.790
Before you explained about your father...

51:23.000 --> 51:25.210
I honestly hoped you came ...

51:25.410 --> 51:29.170
because of the one million marks reward.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.420
Can you appreciate my disappointment?

51:54.230 --> 51:57.450
Come here, Mrs. Dvorak.
Come, come, come.

51:57.990 --> 52:00.240
Wait over here

52:00.990 --> 52:03.660
Is this the girl who sent the our
men the wrong way?

52:10.750 --> 52:12.590
You don't know her at all?

52:12.800 --> 52:15.880
Yes, I know her.

52:16.550 --> 52:21.720
- She is Miss Novotny.
- Did she come to your shop at noon yesterday?

52:24.260 --> 52:26.060
No.

52:27.060 --> 52:31.860
You know what will happen
to you if you lie?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.110
Yes.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.610
Take her!

52:44.700 --> 52:48.080
Marvelous people,
these Czechs.

52:49.670 --> 52:52.330
Stubborn to the end.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.920
To the bitter end...

52:55.130 --> 52:57.090
Miss Novotny.

52:59.510 --> 53:01.640
Get me Inspector Gruber.

53:01.840 --> 53:05.310
I'm glad you're not involved in
this beastly crime.

53:05.510 --> 53:07.980
Hello?
No, Herr Gruber.

53:08.810 --> 53:12.060
Don't question her anymore.
Make her feel safe.

53:12.270 --> 53:14.310
She is our only good lead, so far.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.110
Tell her you'll let her go...

53:16.320 --> 53:18.150
but hold her here, some excuse...

53:18.400 --> 53:19.990
typing the record or something.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.570
Long enough for us to work.

53:46.470 --> 53:48.140
Attention!

53:48.350 --> 53:49.980
Attention!

53:53.230 --> 53:56.270
Barrack leader
Novotny. 42 men.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.820
Form into straight lines.

53:59.030 --> 54:00.860
Stand up, all of you!

54:01.070 --> 54:02.910
Form up! Faster!

54:03.110 --> 54:06.200
As you stand!

54:06.830 --> 54:10.120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

54:10.330 --> 54:14.460
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

54:14.670 --> 54:15.670
What's your name?

54:15.880 --> 54:17.420
Vasily.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.300
Vasily.

54:20.550 --> 54:23.970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

54:24.180 --> 54:26.760
What does this mean?

54:26.970 --> 54:29.010
<i>- Name?
- Santroch.</i>

54:34.690 --> 54:36.690
No, Herr Inspector.

54:36.980 --> 54:38.400
Nothing.

54:39.570 --> 54:41.610
Here is your report.

54:41.820 --> 54:45.280
Your statement and incident
on the streets.

54:45.490 --> 54:47.410
Sign it.

54:49.030 --> 54:51.660
5:30.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.040
In exactly 30 minutes...

54:55.250 --> 54:59.340
the first 40 hostages will be executed.

55:01.630 --> 55:04.470
Sign all four copies.

55:04.880 --> 55:08.680
By the way, your father is
not among the 40...

55:09.680 --> 55:11.850
this morning.

55:27.360 --> 55:31.160
You are free to leave now,
Miss Novotny.

55:31.540 --> 55:33.000
Heil, Hitler.

55:35.510 --> 55:39.560
Mascha, I didn't lose my head at all...

55:39.770 --> 55:44.060
even when they found out about your
friend sleeping here the night before last

55:44.270 --> 55:45.270
Aunt Millie!

55:45.480 --> 55:49.320
Don't worry, I stopped
all chance of gossip.

55:49.530 --> 55:55.330
Nip it in the bud. I told them it was
your fiance who stayed over, Jan.

55:55.530 --> 55:56.870
Jan!

56:00.120 --> 56:03.630
- Jan, darling I must talk to you.
- I must talk to you too.

56:03.830 --> 56:06.340
- Where have you been?
- We better go inside.

56:11.840 --> 56:16.220
I'll tell you where I've been:
at the Gestapo since 6:00 this morning.

56:16.430 --> 56:18.390
What did they ask you about, Jan?

56:18.600 --> 56:20.600
They wanted to know where
I spent last night.

56:20.810 --> 56:22.690
- And?
- I told them I was here, of course!

56:22.900 --> 56:25.310
- Of course.
- Mascha, what is this all about? Who is this man?

56:25.520 --> 56:27.730
- What did they ask about him?
- O Inspector Gruber questioned me...

56:27.940 --> 56:30.400
wanted to know if I knew him.

56:36.410 --> 56:38.950
How did he happen to
come to your house?

56:39.200 --> 56:41.580
- He dropped in just after you left.
- To see your Father?

56:41.790 --> 56:45.380
- Was it something political?
- No, nothing political.

56:46.210 --> 56:49.500
He came to see me.

56:50.380 --> 56:51.550
You?

56:51.760 --> 56:54.970
You see, we met at the
symphony last week...

56:55.180 --> 56:58.010
yesterday he...

56:58.220 --> 57:01.890
- dropped in quite unexpectedly.
- And stayed for the night.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.850
It was curfew hour.
He had to stay over.

57:05.100 --> 57:07.440
Charming coincidence.

57:08.570 --> 57:11.570
He was the man who brought you
those roses, wasn't he?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.780
Yes.

57:15.030 --> 57:18.200
"The florist sent them to my mother".
That was a lie too.

57:18.580 --> 57:22.370
Jan, You don't think I...

57:22.580 --> 57:25.170
had anything to do with that man?

57:25.420 --> 57:28.790
Mascha, I always thought that everything between us would be above board...

57:29.000 --> 57:31.550
Open, clean.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.010
Darling, you know I love you.

57:34.220 --> 57:36.930
Please try to believe in me, Jan.

57:37.180 --> 57:39.100
Mascha, why didn't you tell me?

57:39.300 --> 57:41.560
Don't ask me why.

57:41.770 --> 57:44.480
If you love me, Jan,
you must believe in me.

57:44.940 --> 57:47.060
You're all I have to believe in.

57:47.270 --> 57:49.610
You know that.
Don't let me down.

57:50.570 --> 57:54.700
Jan, I'll never forget that
you believed in me.

58:07.580 --> 58:09.500
Miss Novotny?

58:09.710 --> 58:12.670
Gestapo. You're under arrest.

58:18.220 --> 58:20.510
We checked your story,
Miss Novotny...

58:20.720 --> 58:24.600
In all of Prague,
no architect called Vanek exists

58:24.850 --> 58:26.230
You're lying.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.980
Where did you say you met him first?

58:28.230 --> 58:29.690
At symphony hall.

58:29.900 --> 58:32.400
You said you met him
during the intermission?

58:32.610 --> 58:35.900
No, he had the seat next to mine.

58:36.110 --> 58:37.700
And he told you his name was Vanek?

58:37.910 --> 58:39.990
Yes, Karel Vanek.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.330
- What's his real name?
- I don't know.

58:43.540 --> 58:46.080
What illegal organizations does
your daughter belong too?

58:46.290 --> 58:48.120
None at all. Mascha is a music student.

58:48.370 --> 58:50.210
This Karel Vanek...

58:50.420 --> 58:54.160
Isn't he one of your husbands former
colleagues from the university?

58:54.360 --> 58:55.420
A fellow teacher?

58:55.630 --> 58:59.050
- Professor Novotny had never met him before.
- Where does this man live?

58:59.260 --> 59:01.350
How shall I know?
He didn't tell me.

59:01.600 --> 59:05.310
Is it usual for your niece to entertain
strange gentlemen at night?

59:05.520 --> 59:06.350
No.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.270
How many times did he sleep over
at your apartment?

59:09.560 --> 59:12.440
Only that night.
And on the account of curfew.

59:12.650 --> 59:15.320
Why did he come that particular night?

59:15.530 --> 59:18.860
- I don't know.
- Answer properly!

59:19.070 --> 59:22.030
You know we have means
to make you talk.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.450
Maybe you have heard about
the rooms below.

59:25.700 --> 59:27.160
What was his exact reason for coming?

59:27.540 --> 59:31.210
A former call, to pay respects
to my daughter is all.

59:31.420 --> 59:34.880
Why did you sister-in-law say it was your daughters fiance?

59:35.090 --> 59:38.630
Because I was afraid the neighbors
would gossip about a stranger.

59:39.130 --> 59:42.680
What was this "stranger"'s real name?

59:42.890 --> 59:44.760
- Mr. Vanek.
- You're lying!

59:44.970 --> 59:47.020
- I'm not lying.
- No?

59:47.230 --> 59:48.770
We'll soon find out.

59:48.980 --> 59:51.150
Do you know where your sister is
right now at this moment?

59:51.350 --> 59:53.820
She is where everybody ends up
who doesn't tell us the truth!

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.440
Mrs. Dvorak!

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.580
The whole family sticks to the same story...

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.750
But I don't believe this man,
Karel Vanek, exists

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.130
This letter arrived at the Novotny
apartment half an hour ago...

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.930
by special messenger with a bouquet of roses...

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.140
from a  "Mr. Karel Vanek".

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.180
Vanek!

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.430
Interesting.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.900
Why, this is ridicules!

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.440
You told me that this man doesn't exists

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.440
Curios.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:23.450
He doesn't exist, yet here he is.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:31.450
You're not going to tell me we went through
all this trouble for a silly love affair?

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.330
Looks that way.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.330
What do you suggest, Gruber?

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.710
That we release the girl.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.510
- What?
- What else can we do?

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.170
Are we suppose to interfere with lovers?

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.760
Or are we?

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:33.190
Miss Mascha, I had to come and offer
all my sympathy to you and your mother ...

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.230
for your father's arrest.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.150
I have been unable to get that
tragic scene out of my mind.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.870
Ever since yesterday morning, I've been in the
depths of despair trying to quiet my conscience.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.120
- I came to offer my help.
- Help!

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.830
You're talking of help!

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.120
The one responsible for all
we have been through!

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.670
<i>You spent the night with your conscience brother you?</i>

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.590
<i>We spent it with the Gestapo!</i>

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:56.050
<i>My whole family is still there.</i>

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.170
<i>You're the one the Gestapo wants!</i>

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.260
<i>You killed...</i>

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.810
<i>any feelings I...</i>

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.430
<i>ever had for you.</i>

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.520
<i>The things we've been through merrily
because you spent the night here...</i>

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.400
<i>- Mr. Vanek.
- Mascha...</i>

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.400
I can't tell you how sorry I am...

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:20.240
that my thoughtlessness has
brought to you.

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:23.450
Whatever you think of me,
I deserve and more.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.210
Tell me the truth!

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.080
Alright, Mascha, I will.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.920
<i>I gave you a false name.</i>

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:37.460
<i>My name is not Karel Vanek,
and I'm not an architect.</i>

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.630
<i>I am Dr. Franticek Svoboda...</i>

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.340
<i>resident surgeon
at St. Pancrazio hospital .</i>

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.930
<i>Why didn't you tell me that right away?</i>

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.350
<i>Maybe we ought to go into
the living room.</i>

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.690
<i>- Out here we might be overheard..</i>

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.320
<i>Mascha, I must make an confession.</i>

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:04.780
<i>I love you.</i>

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.740
I did take advantage of the curfew law
to stay over night...

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:12.120
But now it seems my silly little
escapade has boomeranged...

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.170
And I have fallen head over heels
with you Mascha.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.960
And that is my only excuse for the
trouble I've made you.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.010
I think I understand you much better now,
Dr. Svoboda.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.600
And you do forgive me?

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:30.560
<i>I really ought to blame myself. After all...</i>

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.890
- Shut it down!
- Well...

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.560
This puts us right back to where we started.

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.480
There is something fishy about all of this.

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.690
Why can't we admit when we are through?

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.360
You've have wasted all our time over
a cheap romance.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.120
Release the family, start from scratch...

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.870
before Berlin comes down on our necks.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.508
They're lovers.
Maybe.

01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:56.210
I remember exactly, because it was the
same day his Excellency was shot.

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.670
- You're sure of the time?
- I have the operation reports right here.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.260
Dr. Svoboda assisted me while I
performed the Cholecystectomy.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:07.390
During the operation he was in charge
of the suction pump apparatus as usual.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:11.010
Dr. Kesselbach, I understand you
also function as physician ...

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.770
for storm troop 34.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.390
Yes, sir.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.980
And Dr. Svoboda was there that day,
throughout the operation?

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:19.020
Yes, for 42 hours.

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.360
He stood only a few feet away from me.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:24.400
You understand, Herr Inspector,
these intestinal operations...

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.860
- require constant control...
- I understand, Dr. Kesselbach, Thank you.

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:31.200
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you, professor.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.500
Heil, Hitler!

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.040
Heil, Hitler!

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:43.760
Frankly, I dislike being beaten.

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:46.470
Even by our most distinguish poet.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.510
You know, Mr. Necval, I always wanted
to met your personally...

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.720
- and now at last..
- I had always hoped to met you, Professor Novotny.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.470
- and now at last..
- Excuse me, Mr. Necval...

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.600
- I wonder if I could bother you?
- Yes?

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.650
I happen to just scribble something
down today just to...

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:01.570
a few lines for a song maybe.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.480
You being such a big writer,
I thought if you have the time...

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:06.650
please look it over. Fix it up a bit?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.820
My friend, I have all the time
in the world here...

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.660
until these who'eses...

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.080
Well, this is a scribble.

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.080
Here, you better read it to me.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:27.760
"Fellow patriots,
the time has come.

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:30.840
Fellow patriots,
there is work to be done.

01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:34.470
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.190
Keep it burning, keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.650
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.610
but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.650
Ever onward,
no returning...

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.780
the senseless butcher will be learning...

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:52.660
that this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:55.950
Carry on,
when we are gone.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.540
No surrender!"

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.790
Of course you could made
that a lot better.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.050
No, my friend...

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.010
let's have it just as it stands.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.180
How does it go again?
"Fellow patriots..." Let me see that please?

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:17.930
"The time has come.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.850
Fellow patriots,
there's work to be done.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.190
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.020
Keep it burning...

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:30.690
Keep it burning, forward on
the road that has no turning.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.660
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:36.120
but shout to the end:...

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.910
'No surrender!'."

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.409
<i>So we must answer to terror with terror</i>

01:07:43.637 --> 01:07:46.127
<i>theirs  is the murder of hostages...</i>

01:07:46.607 --> 01:07:49.488
<i>Ours is the slowing down of
the German war machine.</i>

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:55.076
By the end of the week
all war production must be lowered by a full 25%.

01:07:55.843 --> 01:07:57.780
I work in the office of a
former hardware factory.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.180
Now making parts for heavy tanks.

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.430
A few days ago, a telegram
came in from Berlin...

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.230
to stop immediately the manufacture
of 5 special tank parts.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.020
Because the new model tanks they have
started making for the Russian front.

01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:13.150
Luckily, I saw the telegram
before anyone else saw it.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360
So I tore it up and threw it in the stove.

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:16.700
But what will happen?

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.319
They'll go on making the same 5 parts.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.700
But when we send them to Germany...

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.290
they won't fit the new tanks.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:30.670
Emil?

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.380
I think you all know sufficiently...

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:40.470
by my work with this group
in the past..

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.100
that no sacrifice has been
too great for me.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.439
Yet I tremble before the bloodshed...

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.649
that threaten so many innocent victims.

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.779
850 hostages have been arrested by now.

01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:57.700
<i>More than 250 are already dead.</i>

01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.950
<i>The very flower of our Czech nation...</i>

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.279
<i>faces systematic annihilation.</i>

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.410
Scientists, leaders of commerce and industry, artists...

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.630
even priests of God!

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:12.420
So I ask, regardless of sentiment...

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:17.130
Can our nation afford the loss of
these outstanding citizens?

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.890
I say to myself, again, and again...

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.470
this man, whoever he is...

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.680
whoever executed "the Hangman",
is a great patriot...

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:27.479
a hero!

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:31.859
But still, I can't help myself...

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.439
I keep thinking: "If this man would
surrender himself...

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:40.529
If he would say: 'Here I am, do with me
what you will, but spare the innocent'"...

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.240
Wouldn't that be better for our beloved country?

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.830
So I ask our group here,
if it should agree with me...

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.800
to move to submit my proposal
to the Central Committee.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.410
Already people are saying...

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.040
it is sheer lunacy to sacrifice
hundreds of lives for one.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.380
Emil, where did you hear people
saying such things?

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.960
All over Prague.

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.170
I've even heard people blaming
the underground...

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.760
for this new wave of German terror.

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:17.050
Not where I work,
and I keep my ears open.

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.510
- Right.
- I've listened to many women...

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.020
some of them wives and
mothers of hostages.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.460
Not one of them spoke a
single word against this.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.480
I'm absolutely against the motion.

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:32.480
I must ask to be excused on
voting on this matter.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.900
My older brother was one of the hostages
executed this morning

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:41.070
All those in favor,
raise their hands.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.000
Now the "nays"?

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.000
I think the "nays" have it.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.670
We have to adjourn now,
it's getting near curfew.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.760
Leave one by one at irregular intervals.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.740
Dr. Pillar, is any one in your group...

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.250
know anything about you
except your first name?

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.830
Only the leader, Bartos.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.420
Anyway, you better not attend
any further meetings.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.380
You're the only one in this group
involved in the Heydrich affair.

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:38.420
Anyone who was involved should have
severed connection with this group.

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.720
I understand.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.820
Bartos, I just told the doctor here
not to attend ...

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.740
any meetings of your group
until further notice.

01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:02.740
Dr. Pillar, use the stairs, please.

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.210
I think this group will have to be
dissolved immediately.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.540
I know exactly what you're thinking.
That peculiar motion.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.760
- You know this man well?
- Certainly.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.340
He's been with us 2 years,
contribute a lot of money.

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.430
How does he function in your group?

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.010
He uses our beer wagons to
distribute our leaflets.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.770
He's the big brewer, Czaka, Emil Czaka.

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:33.520
Remember 2 years ago when that group
in Pilsen, was betrayed to the Gestapo...

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:36.860
- and 12 were executed?
- The Pilsen raid.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.543
Yes, I know.
Czaka was suspected for a while.

01:12:39.743 --> 01:12:42.740
But it was established that
the traitor spoke perfect German...

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:45.070
and a very thorough investigation
proved that Czaka...

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.120
doesn't speak a bit of German.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.040
You think I put myself in danger?

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.750
In all probability you talked yourself
into kingdom come.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.380
But you suggested it.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.460
I suggested you feel out the grounds,
test their morale.

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:02.970
I didn't suggest you crawl out on a limb
and saw yourself off.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:09.390
- Take some cheese, it's good.
- No I have no more appetite.

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:12.310
Maybe...

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.350
maybe it would be safer if I left town?

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:19.070
Sorry sir, once you work for the Gestapo...

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.230
you work for the Gestapo.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.360
Then I insist you give me
a special body guard.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:26.410
I will not do anything without it.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.530
You'll do everything,
... and like it.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.250
Herr Gruber,
how can you treat me like this?

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.910
I've done so much for you all these years,
and for Germany!

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.830
And why did you do so much for us,
Czaka?

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.960
Because as a real Czech patriot
I realize our entire future...

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.090
depends on unconditional collaboration
with greater Germany.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:48.680
And I thought you did it
for business reasons.

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.140
For certain favors...

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.680
for certain very profitable military contracts.

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:55.560
May I?

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:02.190
- Nice gold lighter.
- You like it?

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.700
You wouldn't think of bribing me...

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.200
with a gold lighter.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:11.330
Czaka, Czaka, Czaka...

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.620
Suppose I pay you for police protection?

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:17.920
Oh, just like life insurance?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.630
How much of a premium would you
be willing to pay?

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.550
How much do you want?

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.470
2,000 marks.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.340
2,000 marks per week?

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:30.800
Per day.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.850
2,000 marks per day?

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.930
Only a few days until we
round up your friends...

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.440
then you just drop the insurance.

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:42.570
Say 5 days,
10,000 marks.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.280
Suppose it lasts a month?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.070
So what? Another 50,000 marks.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.580
Why Czaka, you are a big beer magnat.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.620
Just another drop in the barrel.

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:12.260
Make that check payable to the treasurer
of the Occupational Police Fund.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.270
That's it, Czaka.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.070
I am the treasurer.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.240
I know.

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:45.520
- Yes?
- Your Father will be executed...

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:49.860
at 6:00 this morning. You will be allowed
to see him before he is taken away.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:54.280
In a half an hour the police car will take
you to the camp. That's all.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.830
You have ten minutes,
no more.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.630
Monkey.

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:21.890
Yesterday I was questioned about that
gentleman who visited us.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:25.020
Me too, but everything turned out all right.

01:16:25.230 --> 01:16:28.100
He came back to apologize...

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:31.900
and offered me any help we might need.

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:33.780
That's good.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:37.740
How is mother and Ludmilla?
and Beda, how is he?

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:40.370
Mother tried to see you.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.040
I was permitted to write her a letter.

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:47.960
I think the censor will let it through.

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.830
It was only personal.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.550
I also started a letter to Beda...

01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:59.300
I was sure it would not pass.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.930
I'll tell it to you, Mascha,
and you repeat it to him.

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:09.850
What I now want to say to you my son...

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.610
is meant for you when you
are a grown man...

01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:16.820
the now mighty invaders...

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:20.700
will now have been thrown off our land
for quite some time.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:22.780
"Quite some time."

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:25.490
I hope you will be living in a free land...

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.040
where the people are truly governed
by themselves and for themselves.

01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:33.500
Those will be great days to live.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.710
"Those will be great days to live."

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.050
In a land where all the men, women, and
children will have enough good food to eat.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.680
And time to read, and to think...

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:49.480
and to talk things over with one another
for their own good.

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:54.230
When such great days do come...

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.950
don't forget that freedom is not
something one possesses...

01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:02.110
like a hat or piece of candy.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.330
The real thing is fighting for freedom.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:09.000
And you might remember me...

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.670
not because I've been your Father...

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:13.750
but because...

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.920
I also died in this great fight.

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:18.840
"Because I also died...

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:22.050
in this great fight."

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.410
Time is up, Novotny!

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:03.970
<i>Attention.</i>

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.970
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.270
He still has his life in your hands.

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:21.610
Who was the man you helped escape...

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.950
when you sent our men the wrong way?

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.570
I tell you I sat on that
investigating committee myself...

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.860
and Czaka was entirely clear
of that raid in Pilsen.

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:43.780
Because the traitor spoke German and Czaka doesn't...?

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.990
Yes.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.580
Yet when he came to Prague and brought his brewery...

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:50.210
he paid with a Deutsche check
from the Bank of Berlin...

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.380
according to a little research of my own.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.000
Maybe Czaka does understand German.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.607
Listen, I've got an idea.
It might work now after these 2 years.

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.390
I don't know, but we can try.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.060
What?

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:14.480
We can use Rudy
for this.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.070
Hello, Beda.

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:22.610
Father was shot this morning.

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:25.450
Shot?
But I...

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.910
- Mascha!
- Jan, will you come with me please?

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.540
I'm going to the camp to claim his body.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:35.290
But Mascha here is a list of all those
who were executed this morning.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:39.210
Your father's name is not among them.
See here, under the N's.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.680
Only 4, Navitol,
Napitol, Naavi and Nimocek.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.890
But I saw him on the truck this morning ...

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.430
Yes, Miss Novotny?

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:51.230
Oh, your Father.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:54.230
No, that list is correct.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.270
No. Just a little mistake.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:58.940
You were right, Jan.

01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:01.400
Mother! Mother!

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.030
They play with human beings
like a cat with a mouse.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.830
I don't care.
I don't care!

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.620
As long as he is alive.

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:39.480
- Yes?
- Bartos just called me to met him for lunch.

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:41.940
A sort of informal meeting.
What shall I do?

01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:43.950
Go!

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.070
What?

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.740
Listen, I'll arrest him when I see fit,
not before.

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.500
What about these two that you still
only know by their first names?

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.790
<i>But they will kill me!</i>

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.630
Alright, you'll have your police guard.
Where do you want them, and when?

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.920
Back room...

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.010
Cafe Kramer.

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:08.050
Mr. Emil.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.310
- Well, Emil.
- Emil!

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.100
I want you to met my Uncle,
Mr. Dedic, just in from Kladno.

01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:17.770
- You're having lunch with us?
- Yes, I only have time for a quick bite...

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.020
before I catch my train to Karlsbad.

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:22.900
Passing through I thought I would
say hello to my nephew.

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:25.400
Well, my pleasure, sir.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:27.700
Won't you be seated?

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.620
Uncle.
Matushka.

01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:31.990
Emil.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
just between ourselves...

01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:45.510
I don't recommend the goulash,
but the paprica liver...

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.930
simply prewar!

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.350
And speaking of food,
or rather "No food"...

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:56.140
I heard the most wonderful Hitler story
yesterday. You understand German?

01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:57.390
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.730
You have to excuse me, I can only tell it in
German or I'll ruin the whole joke.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.240
Well, I know a little school book German.
That is if you want me to hear it!

01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:09.780
- Of course.
- Sure you'll translate for us, Matushka.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.540
Goebbels comes to Hitler...

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:19.500
"Adolf, we have food for 5 years."

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.790
"Five years? Really?" Said the Fuhrer.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.340
"Yes, five years," Goebbels said.
And the Fuhrer said...

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:28.590
"I must tell Herman Goring"

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.300
"No, by God,"
replies Goebbels.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:37.350
"Do not tell Herman.
It's just the two of us, you and me."

01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:57.910
I happen to remember another Hitler joke.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.290
Hitler said to one of his elite guards...

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.250
I forget how it goes.

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.130
Yesterday you showed a very good memory...

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.210
for the teachings of your Gestapo friends...

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.650
when you tried to convince us that we should surrender
the man who shot Heydrich.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.260
So, you don't understand German,
you slimy scum?

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.760
No, I don't. I swear!

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:28.780
Drag him back,
keep him quiet.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.820
<i>Here, help me, police!</i>

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.790
Get out! Through the window!

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.210
Help, police!

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.500
- Let's get out of the kitchen.
- Go ahead, we'll cover you!

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.820
Halt! Put your hands up!

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.870
Friends, I am Jan Pestuca,
editor of the "Prague Evening News"...

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.750
<i>and I have been requested to
speak to each barracks.</i>

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.330
<i>At 5 O'clock, we hostages...</i>

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.380
<i>will be given the opportunity to
address all of Czechoslovakia...</i>

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:31.510
<i>for a full hour's broadcast</i>

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.720
<i>Each barracks will be represented
by 2 or 3 volunteers...</i>

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:40.520
who will speak of the necessary of the
immediate surrender of the assassin.

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.900
Volunteer speakers must be
ready at 4:30 sharp.

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:48.900
Attention!

01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.660
It's clear as daylight...

01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:03.160
they're trying to use us as a cat's paw
to get the assassin for them.

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:06.540
I say, let the Czech people decide.

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:09.130
Our lives,
or the assassin's.

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.760
I hope there will be no such
volunteering in here.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.590
What else is there to do?

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.890
It's not only a question of saving
the 300 of us still alive.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.180
But after we're shot, what then?...

01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:21.600
there will be another 300, then 3,000.

01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:23.930
There will be no end until
they get the assassin.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.650
There will be no end anyway,
and they never needed a beginning.

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:29.190
They slaughtered thousands
long before Heydrich.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.690
Just for breathing Czech air.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:35.570
Has it ever occurred to you professor
that the assassin is letting us pay for his act...

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:39.700
While he goes scot free?
He, and his underground pals.

01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:52.900
I don't intent to wast my
time with you here.

01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:56.440
What we want is the identity
of this man, Dedic.

01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.650
Aldrich Krapke, the engineer?

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:02.700
- Yes.
- As an educated man...

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:07.870
surely you are intelligent enough to see the
unpleasant experiences ahead of you.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.870
You understand, Aldrich...

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.960
when Herr Gruber
says "unpleasant"...

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:15.790
he's merely being polite.

01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.800
What's he doing here?

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.630
He belongs here, Gestapo informer.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.130
I don't get it.

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.050
You'll get it soon enough...

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:27.300
right through your head just
before we knock it off.

01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:30.020
Why, you stinking fat crawling scum, you!

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.890
You shut your mouth you
filthy Bolshevik traitor!

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.980
- Sabotador...
- Chega!

01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:39.900
You don't have to prove to us
that you're not one of them.

01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:43.740
Katerina Honiga,
private secretary.

01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:47.240
You sabotaged your factory very cleverly.

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.660
Perhaps you are...

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:52.660
clever enough not to want to
visit our vault downstairs?

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:55.420
Perhaps you prefer to talk to me...

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.630
in private.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.340
No, I can tell you right here
what I think of you.

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:03.010
- You pig.
Yes, you better not see her alone...

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:06.800
you stool pigeon, or she'll scratch your
eyes out, you fascist blood hound.

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:11.850
Big talk. Ten minutes down below and
you'll beg them to kill you.

01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:16.650
Your mothers use to lay with rats!

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.440
their milk was sewage.

01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:23.190
Take them to the vaults.
All of them!

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.030
Tell them I want to know
about this Dedic.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.740
- Down there!
- Take them!

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.750
Are these all the volunteer
speakers you have?

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.790
Commandant, barracks 2 and 3 failed to
produce anyone who volunteered.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.630
Herr Commandant, in our barrack #5,
they also tried to prevent us...

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.180
Quiet. Be ready to began your
speeches in exactly 2 minutes

01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:49.260
Yes sir, I just have another idea
to jot down for my speech.

01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:53.350
That is not necessary.
Here are your speeches.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.270
<i>We must climb the path to loyal collaboration...</i>

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:02.110
<i>and our very first step must be
to surrender the assassin.</i>

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.110
Just plain common sense.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.240
I was always against using force.

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:10.950
<i>Not one of us would hesitate to die
for the true welfare of our nation.</i>

01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:13.740
But people of Prague,
I ask you...

01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:17.920
shall we perish for the vicious act
of a murdering manic?

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.960
Stop that immediately!

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:22.630
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not gonna be shot!

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.340
- Everyone sit down!
- Be quiet!

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.520
The Germans have succeeded, in part
in shattering the unity of the city.

01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:33.190
Many people are now using
the word "assassin"...

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.190
whereas before they only spoke
of him as the "executionar".

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.110
If I may suggest, perhaps you should all
know what Dedic wants you to do.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.160
He's at my apartment now.

01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:46.200
His condition is serious.
Shot through the lung

01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:48.700
But why did he go,
of all places, to you?

01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:52.580
- It was a terrible risk to expose you.
- He took every possible precaution.

01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:56.380
He changed taxi's a number of times.
Went through buildings and backyards...

01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:58.300
until he was dead certain no one had followed him.

01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:59.920
He could have come here just as well.

01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:03.010
And we would have called in another
doctor without involving you.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:06.050
He did not just come to me
just for me to treat his wound.

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:09.270
- What else?
- To give me in detail my instructions.

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:12.100
- Instructions?
- Where do you come into this?

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:15.190
As Dedic sees it, we are faced
with two vital problems...

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.360
each depended upon the other.

01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:20.940
If we could find a way of saving the lives
of the remaining hostages...

01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:22.990
or as many as possible...

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.030
we would at the same time restore
the unity of the city.

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.580
it would be a tremendous victory...

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.170
But in the end, it's either the hostages
or you. We can't save both.

01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:38.880
I don't see any possible chance of us
getting these 2 birds with one stone.

01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:41.970
As Dedic sees it,
there is a chance.

01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:45.930
What about those bloodstains
in your cab?

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.140
I never would have put 2 and 2 together...

01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:50.520
the car washer here calls me tonight...

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.020
and tells me he found blood drops
on the backseat of my cab.

01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:56.940
- Just then I was home eating my soup...
- I'm not interested in your soup.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:00.070
What makes you think I'm
interested in a cab...

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.650
where some passenger maybe
had a nose bleed?

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.660
Herr Gruber, he recognized the description
of Dedic from tonight's newspapers...

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.490
as one of his passengers.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:12.370
- Where did you drop this passenger?
- Well... that's the trouble...

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.410
I don't remember.

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:19.040
Maybe he was the one I took
to Czerny St, but, maybe not.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.340
This is crap!

01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:23.340
We have a list of his runs today.

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:26.800
We could send someone to
everyone of these places.

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:30.600
Listen, you tell me at 11:30 at night...

01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:34.310
that this man went to one of 15
different houses this afternoon...

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:37.400
And you really think this Dedic, if it was he...

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.310
will kindly wait for us...

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.280
until we come to call on him
to pay our respects?

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.320
Get them out of here!
Go home and finish your soup.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.620
Querida?

01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:00.130
Arnold...

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.170
Come here.

01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:09.760
Hey!
Hey, you with the soup!

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.020
What was that address you think
you dropped him at?

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:15.810
<i>Czerny St,
61 Czerny St.</i>

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.100
Czerny St. Czerny St.

01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:20.730
Czerny St, 61.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.860
Czerny St.
Czerny St.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.650
Czerny St!

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.070
Czerny St.

01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:33.830
Czerny St.

01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.500
"Czerny St, 21."

01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:48.090
From 21 to 61,
is 20 houses.

01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:51.760
- Dr. Svoboda?
- Yes.

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.890
Gestapo.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.350
- You live here alone?
- Yes.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.270
You didn't per chance receive a visit
from a man with a bullet wound?

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.570
No.

01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:17.830
- You can't go in there!
- Stop this non-sense!

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.250
Men!

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.670
Open!

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:38.600
Well, the situation here would tend
to exclude the presences...

01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:41.520
of any third person.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.700
Sorry...

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.290
but you see, we are looking for
the uncle of a certain Mr. Bartos...

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.370
Who asked me to deliver his last farewell.

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.580
In person.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.650
Muller, check the whole building
from cellar to roof.

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.940
Every room and closet.

01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:29.690
Yes, sir.
Attention.

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:35.070
Come in doctor, come in. No, no, no,
Miss Novotny, please remain as you are.

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:37.910
I'm only staying a little while.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.500
Catch my breath, and smoke a cigarette.
If I may, doctor?

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.180
Well, well, my young friend...

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.760
I don't mind admitting I'm surprised.

01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.140
You see doctor, personally,
I have never been fully convinced...

01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:02.930
Of your marvelous quick success of Miss Novotny.

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.850
And you, Miss Novotny,
you surprise me even more.

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:09.020
After all, you're engaged to be
married in a few weeks...

01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:12.030
but I suppose that in wartime
life moves a lot faster.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.780
Inspector, there is a limit to these insults.

01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:18.580
Of course, doctor,
my humble apologies mademoiselle.

01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:22.540
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- Just a few more puffs.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.460
You see...

01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:27.290
I had no idea I would find you here...

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.170
at least not tonight.

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:34.680
In my stupid way, I thought I would
find a certain gentleman...

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.970
who in turn, would help me find
that other gentleman.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:42.100
You remember,
whom you helped Kladno Av..

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:44.810
That's all very interesting,
Inspector...

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.190
But if you insist on keeping us company...

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.020
Perhaps you would like a glass of wine
to go with your cigarette.

01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.700
Well, well, doctor,
I would be delighted.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.860
You have no beer?

01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:59.950
Of course you have no "beer".

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.450
Beer wouldn't be the thing in such
a romantic atmosphere.

01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:13.800
Sorry, Inspector,
the rug.

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:17.430
But better be careful when you
stumble near me again, doctor...

01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:22.100
my boys here got just a little nervous just then.

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.860
We have fulfill your orders.

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.260
Horak, I thought you might
be curious to met...

01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:07.640
Dr. Franticek Svoboda,
surgeon at St. Pancrazio hospital.

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:14.650
The same gentleman who visited your fiance the other night...

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.490
under the name "Karel Vanek".

01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:22.160
Inspector,
why did you have me brought here?

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:25.790
Horak, I thought we both had the
right to the whole truth.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.000
You ought to know what
your fiance is up too.

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:34.710
Well, I guess this all becomes a
personal matter between you three.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:38.470
Let's go.
I think I'll leave you alone.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.890
Good night.

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.680
Jan, you mustn't...

01:37:46.770 --> 01:37:50.560
Well, what are you staring at?
You think you own me?

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.400
You were lying to me all along.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.480
Yes I was. I just fell in love with him ...

01:37:55.690 --> 01:37:58.780
<i>That's all there was to it.
Can't you understand that?</i>

01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:00.610
<i>Yes.</i>

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.370
<i>I'm sorry Franticek, for all that's happened...</i>

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:05.530
Horak!

01:38:08.290 --> 01:38:12.000
It looks like both of us
had delusions tonight.

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.510
- Find something, Mueller?
- Not at all, Herr Inspector.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.430
- Am I free to leave now?
- Not yet.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.800
What do you say to having a drink on me?
That is an order. Muller!

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.850
I want you to watch this house, closely.

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.020
If those two try to leave,
find out where they go.

01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:33.900
- As you order, Herr Inspector.
- Schirmer we'll leave you in the morning.

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.120
The small leather case on the desk.
The hypodermic.

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:05.100
Come on sweetheart, get it off your chest.

01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:08.730
Take it from me. No woman
should be trusted to long.

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.190
Ain't it the truth?

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.860
Don't be a sucker, big boy.
There are more fish to come.

01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:19.490
Well, 6:00 already. What do you say
we go over to his place?

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.790
That is an order too.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.500
You shouldn't talk.
This wound is serious.

01:39:23.710 --> 01:39:27.420
I haven't much time.
I must finish telling you.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.170
Miss Novotny, all our thanks...

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.510
you're a good fighter.

01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:40.310
Almost everything in this plan
depends on you.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.810
It will be very difficult...

01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:49.230
I believe the people of Prague...

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.320
will come to help us.

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:15.470
- Gruber come in yet?
- No.

01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:19.470
No, and his office can't seem to get in
touch with him. He was out all last night.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.360
That must be the little cutie who
let him down so hard.

01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:36.900
The German offered 20 marks if we could
get info about her cheating before.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.200
It was like pulling teeth.

01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:41.700
Couldn't even get him to talk about her.

01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:45.450
Why does this flatfoot have to know
so much about this dame's lovelife?

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.540
All he told me was he caught
her cheating last night.

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:52.380
Myself, I figured it must had something to do with...

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.800
politics.

01:40:56.010 --> 01:40:59.680
Because Gruber says, how could a
nice girl like that run around like that...

01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:03.350
when her father is one of the hostages
going to be killed any minute.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.350
Come on, fatty,
wake up.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.480
Let me sleep...

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.690
you'll get your money tonight.

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:12.020
I'll be waiting.

01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:20.700
So long, big boy.
Just pretend you never knew her.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.910
Too-da-lu!

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.490
Is it possible now,
to tell his real name?

01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:31.120
No, but his name will not be forgotten.

01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:34.500
One day the school children will honor it.

01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:38.380
"In retaliation for the cowardly
murder of the Reich Protector...

01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:41.710
it is ordered that commencing at 2:00 today...

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:47.840
executions will be carried out
every 2 hrs instead of 24...

01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:49.510
unless the assassin is surrendered."

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.060
Pardon me.

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:02.360
Good morning, Mr. Czaka.

01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:44.330
- This is absurd.
- But I tell you I'm sure.

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:47.040
- You've mistaken me for somebody else.
- No, I'm sure of it.

01:44:47.250 --> 01:44:49.130
Miss please,
everyone is looking at us.

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.186
- I tell you, you're absolutely wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:54.075
Please, miss, please.

01:44:54.598 --> 01:44:56.562
You must met me,
I have to talk to you alone.

01:44:57.139 --> 01:44:58.794
Miss, what do you want
with this gentleman?

01:44:59.571 --> 01:45:01.064
It is nothing,
absolutely nothing.

01:45:03.043 --> 01:45:04.699
What do you mean by that?
Such impertinence.

01:45:05.962 --> 01:45:09.178
Gestapo. Inspector Schirmer.

01:45:10.162 --> 01:45:12.403
Of course.
Naturally that's different then.

01:45:13.179 --> 01:45:15.867
I don't know this person.
I've never seen her before.

01:45:17.067 --> 01:45:19.120
Miss Novotny, we will clear up
this matter somewhere else.

01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:23.080
I think you better take this gentleman
along to headquarters.

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:26.750
But this is absurd. I will report you
to the proper authorities

01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.840
Alright, alright.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.050
I will not go.

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.590
Orders is orders.

01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.010
I will see that you are
properly cared for also.

01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:50.570
And where is this note she wrote?

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.690
Here.

01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:55.360
"I recognize you.

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:58.240
must talk to you immediately at once."

01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:02.660
Well, what does it mean?

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.710
Miss Novotny,
this time you're going to talk.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.170
You recognize Mr. Czaka as whom?

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:15.380
What did you want to say to him
alone that was so important, huh?

01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:18.510
Let me tell you, Herr Ritter,
it's very simple.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.260
She says she recognizes me as someone she helped escaped...

01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:24.520
from Karls Ave. From the Black shirts

01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:30.690
The lady insists that I am the man
who shot Heydrich.

01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:34.070
Me, of all people!

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.870
That is perfectly ridiculous
of course, Mr. Czaka...

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.910
but... just wait here a moment...

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.540
please.

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.020
The following 3 persons will
please step forward.

01:46:54.230 --> 01:46:57.860
You can't take me!
No, no, I won't go! I won't go!

01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:01.400
I helped to catch the assassin.
I want to see the commandant!

01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:03.070
I want to see the commandant!

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.110
I want to see the commandant!
I want to see the commandant!

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.380
The following 3 persons
will step forward.

01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:21.840
Necval.

01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:23.880
Skalda...

01:47:24.670 --> 01:47:25.880
Votruba.

01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:29.300
My name shouldn't be counted. That was
the agreement for speaking on the radio.

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:31.100
Shut up!

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:34.600
All three of you,
forward march!

01:47:44.150 --> 01:47:49.320
Miss Novotny, perhaps you are afraid
because you lied to us before...

01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:56.620
But if you tell the truth now,
I promise to overlook that.

01:47:57.170 --> 01:48:01.840
Remember, we won't stop the executions
until we have the assassin.

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.840
In a few hours,
in any case by tomorrow...

01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:10.300
all hostages will have been shot.

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.980
The odds for your Father...

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.940
are growing smaller by the minute.

01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:23.860
This is your last chance,
Miss Novotny.

01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.160
I was on the Karls Ave.

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.740
You saw the assassin run from the alley?

01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:34.200
Yes, it was the man I saw in the restaurant.

01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.580
- The brewer, Czaka?
- Yes.

01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:39.370
In what direction did he escape from?

01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:42.920
Just around the corner from Dresden St,
just where I told the officer.

01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:45.630
Did you see him running until
he was out of sight?

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.970
No, there was a passing cab,
and it drove off with him.

01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:54.260
For your sake, Miss Novotny,
I'm glad you added that detail.

01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:59.640
It confirms with a voluntary statement
from the same cab driver.

01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:02.810
Ritter, bring in Czaka.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.150
And the horse cab driver.

01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.360
That's him, alright.

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.580
I've never seen this man before.

01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:16.120
You picked him up on the corner of Karls Ave and Dresden?

01:49:16.330 --> 01:49:19.160
Yes, sir. And he said:
"Drive as fast as you can."

01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:21.880
Where did he ask to be taken?

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.840
Some place with furnished rooms,
with no questions asked.

01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:27.380
Like I told you this morning.

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.180
It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous!

01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:35.140
The man has got me mixed up
with somebody else.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.310
Herr Standarten Fuhrer...

01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:42.850
during the time of the assassination
of his Excellency...

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.320
the late Reich Protector...

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.240
at that very time, I was having
lunch at the Golden Quail...

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.070
Where I always eat,
just like today.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.780
You can check it quite easily.

01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:55.910
Do you remember day when
the Reich Protector was shot?

01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.410
Naturally, what Czech doesn't?

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:01.330
- It was last Wednesday at noon.
- Exactly.

01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.250
And on that day, at that time, did
Mr. Czaka have lunch at your restaurant?

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.380
- Now you'll see...
- No, your excellency.

01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:09.510
No, Mr. Czaka didn't come in that day.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.720
I remember it like my own birthday.

01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:14.760
I held his usual table for him,
your excellency.

01:50:14.970 --> 01:50:19.390
I even said to Albert here,
maybe Mr. Czaka is sick or something.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.060
- But Novak, I was there.
- No, Mr. Czaka.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.320
No, Mr. Czaka, I remember because I put
on your table your favorite Rhine wine...

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.440
the old Riesling. But I had to take it off
when you didn't show up.

01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:32.700
No.
You're all mixed up.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.990
You, how can you make such a mistake?

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.870
Please try to remember.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.370
I was there.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:47.090
Freddy, you brought me
a pack of cigarettes.

01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:49.760
I dropped them on the floor,
remember?

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.800
No, Mr. Czaka, that was the day
before the shooting.

01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:59.350
Pauline, didn't you check my hat that day,
as always?

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.390
Didn't I even pinch your cheek,
and you said: "No, Mr. Czaka"?

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.270
Didn't I tip you nicely,
as always?

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:07.190
You always do, Mr. Czaka,
but not that day.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.360
- You didn't come that day.
- You're crazy!

01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:13.150
You, all of you, crazy!

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.320
What's going on here anyway?

01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:20.200
What is the meaning of all of this?
I demand an explanation!

01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:23.000
Stop shouting at me,
Mr. Czaka.

01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:25.710
We demand an explanation.

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.880
Where were you at the time
of the assassination?

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.670
I told you.

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.180
I told you, in the Golden Quail, eating.
And after lunch I had a business...

01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:38.260
conference with Mr. Tomas Pulta,
the bearing manufacturer.

01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:41.600
Yes, in his own apartment until 5:30.

01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:44.270
How do you remember that time so well?

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.690
Because at 6:00 I had another appointment right here...

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:49.980
in the Gestapo,
with Inspector Gruber.

01:51:50.190 --> 01:51:54.190
I was with him until way after midnight helping him prepare the list...

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.740
the list of the hostages.

01:51:59.490 --> 01:52:01.370
Brodavka.

01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:06.370
Vystyd.

01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:10.790
Pescacek.

01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:15.220
Walk out!

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.510
- Good bye, Pescacek.
- Good bye.

01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:22.970
Come on, come on.

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:25.680
Sing "The Invisible Torch"!

01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:29.730
<i>...and pass it along...</i>

01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:33.820
<i>Keep it burning,
Keep it burning,</i>

01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:38.240
<i>keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.</i>

01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:41.950
<i>Die if you must,
for a cause that is just...</i>

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.950
<i>but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.</i>

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.710
Stop the singing!

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:50.040
<i>- Ever onward, never returning
- Silence!</i>

01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:53.840
- the filthy butcher will be learning.
-Stop the singing!

01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:57.760
<i>this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.</i>

01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:01.930
<i>Carry on,when we are gone.
No surrender!"</i>

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:03.970
<i>No surrender!</i>

01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:08.890
I must regret to inform you,
the bearing manufacturer, Mr. Pulta...

01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:12.690
was one of the hostages executed
at 2:00 this afternoon.

01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:15.730
Pulta?
Shot?

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:19.490
How does he get on the list?
I had business with him.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700
I didn't suggest his name.

01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:24.620
I suppose I ought to apologize
for neglecting to notify you?

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:29.210
In any case, his widow Mrs. Pulta,
testifies you never appeared that day.

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.750
- What?
- But, here is another lady...

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.550
- who can tell us the exact reason.
- I don't know this woman.

01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.010
Mrs. Nimitz, last night you testified that
on the day of the assassination...

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:43.010
the cab brought a certain well dressed
man to your rooming house.

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.720
Yes, this man here.

01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:48.890
Will you repeat your testimony please?
Just as you gave it last night?

01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:52.520
He came exactly at half pass twelve noon.

01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:54.820
I showed him a room for 3 marks.

01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:57.900
He told me he was expecting a
lady friend, if I wouldn't mind.

01:53:58.110 --> 01:54:01.030
I said: "Well, if you guarantee
she's decent, who cares".

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.910
- So then, he gave me 5 marks.
- Lies! All lies!

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.950
How can you listen to
these traitorous Czechs?

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:09.660
How can you take their word
against mine! I protest!

01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:12.870
You know I'm loyal. For years I've kept
you informed of the underground.

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.550
Only yesterday you got seven through
me! Seven! Only yesterday!

01:54:18.210 --> 01:54:19.800
How can you be so unfair?

01:54:20.010 --> 01:54:23.390
Will you kindly permit the
witness to continue?

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.060
Uninterrupted.

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.690
Will you go on, Mrs. Nimitz,
please.

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:37.860
Well, no lady showed up
all afternoon long.

01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:40.780
Just heard him walking up
and down the room.

01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:44.530
And after a while he comes out and says
he wants to telephone somebody ...

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:47.120
but I said: "I wouldn't even have a phone
if I could afford one ...

01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:49.580
because it is more trouble than it's worth."

01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:54.290
Then about half past five, he comes out
wants to see the afternoon papers...

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.750
all about the shooting of the "Hangman"...

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.090
Reich Protector Heydrich.

01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.510
Then he just put on his hat and went.

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.510
But this morning, after I was
questioned and went home...

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.810
I remember something I found
after this gentleman left his room.

01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:13.270
Here, I brought it with me,
even though it's real gold.

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.530
It has your initials,
Mr. Czaka.

01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:29.660
I don't understand.

01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:31.700
I had it,
this morning.

01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:33.750
I'm sure.

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.420
I must have left in the restaurant.

01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:40.170
This is a frame up.
A fantastic frame up!

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.050
Don't be preposterous.

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:44.970
Are you trying to say the whole city
of Prague is conspiring against you?

01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:48.510
None of these people
know each other at all.

01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:06.030
A minute ago, you said you had
no telephone at all. Didn't you?

01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:08.030
Yes.

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.870
Alright!

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:15.250
Now I'll prove that everything
you said was a filthy dirty lie...

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:18.790
And this whole thing nothing
but a criminal conspiracy.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.550
She said I was in her rooming house
between 12:30 and 5:30.

01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:23.760
Very well.

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.930
She also says
she hasn't got a telephone.

01:56:27.130 --> 01:56:32.260
Then how was it at 2:30 I was talking
to somebody on the telephone?

01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:35.350
And who was that somebody?

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.230
Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:45.030
I demand that Inspector Gruber be
brought in immediately to confirm this.

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:47.320
I also demand the
arrest and investigation...

01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:51.160
everyone of these slimy perjurers.

01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:52.410
Call Inspector Gruber.

01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.000
We have been unable to contact
Inspector Gruber all day.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.460
His office is still trying to locate him.

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:17.640
Just for a pick me up.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.410
No more beer around?

01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:39.710
No more beer.

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:41.710
What's so funny all of a sudden?

01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:45.420
- I like that lipstick.
- What lipstick?

01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:48.720
All over your face.

01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:02.020
I see!

01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:03.860
Yeah...

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:07.280
that lipstick on the doctor's face was perfect...

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:10.360
not all smeared up.

01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:14.830
You're right, Jan, old boy,
your girl is still all yours.

01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:17.950
They staged it.
But a little too perfectly.

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.410
Thanks for the assassin.

01:58:21.330 --> 01:58:22.620
What do you mean?

01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:28.000
If they staged that bedroom act, then the
uncle must have really been there...

01:58:28.210 --> 01:58:34.340
and your little girl put one over
on old man Gruber.

01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:36.050
And why?

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:40.310
Because one or the other
must be the assassin...

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:43.810
Dr. Svoboda or Uncle Dedic.

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:49.360
And your little sweetheart is an 
accomplice to the same assassins.

01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:53.240
But this time she is going to talk,
and talk fast.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.650
It's broken.

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:38.080
Miss Novotny,
your assassin Mr. Czaka...

01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.160
seems to have a perfect alibi...

01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:42.160
No less than Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:46.420
Yes, Miss Novotny,
Inspector Gruber.

01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:48.880
You just wait till he gets here.

01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:51.510
But what about all the hostages
in the meantime?

01:59:51.710 --> 01:59:55.259
The executions will cease the
minute the case is finished.

01:59:55.459 --> 01:59:56.268
Not before.

01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:00.390
But, if Gruber confirms Czaka's alibi...

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.060
everyone of the witnesses today...

02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:06.980
with you first, will go to the
wall with the hostages.

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:14.530
Well, we will now go look into
this alibi of Dr. Svoboda.

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:16.490
It's really worth looking into you know.

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.700
Then we'll take care of you and
your faithful sweetie.

02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:23.250
Now if you will excuse me, Mr. Horak,
I will have to hurry.

02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:28.580
Just relax.

02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:38.470
Can you tell me where to find
Dr. Svoboda?

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:40.760
He is in operating, assisting Professor Kubicek.

02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:42.560
Thanks.

02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:00.970
Close the door, Beda.

02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:05.510
Plenty lucky for you mother was
worried about Mascha...

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.390
and sent me to ask you.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.190
<i>Attention!
Gestapo Inspector Gruber!</i>

02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:11.600
<i>- Wait!
- Attention! Attention!</i>

02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:14.190
<i>Gestapo Inspector Gruber!</i>

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.110
<i>Inspector Gruber,
report to headquarters at once!</i>

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.530
Beda, go over there and wait.

02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:27.540
See if the Gestapo goes poking around.
If she shows up, don't let her go up there.

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.870
I won't, future brother-in-law.

02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:36.840
St. Pancrazio Hospital,
and step on it!

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.560
Dr. Svoboda?

02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.650
That's Dr. Svoboda.

02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:05.570
- Detective Gruber, you looking for me?
- Yes.

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.950
Just a few questions, doctor.

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.000
Where can we talk undisturbed?

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.250
Here, in the locker room.

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:20.010
Talk me doctor,
when you fellows operate...

02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:22.010
you always wear these masks?

02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.300
Naturally, against infection.

02:03:31.770 --> 02:03:33.600
I thought you said
we could talk here all alone?

02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:37.560
It's all the same.
My colleague, Dr. Pillar.

02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:40.900
Inspector Alois Gruber,
Gestapo.

02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:51.750
You were the other one at the operation
the day he shot Heydrich.

02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:55.170
Exactly, Inspector,
Dr. Pillar as you say...

02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:59.170
did take my place that day,
with the mask.

02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:02.960
Very clever.

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:08.180
- May I use your telephone, Dr. Svoboda?
- No.

02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:11.810
No, you better not use that phone.

02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.600
You better put that down, doctor.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.060
I'm gonna put it where it belongs.

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:25.280
If you think you're gonna rush me from both sides...

02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:28.910
that I can only get to one of you in time...

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.580
Then you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised.

02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:36.000
I can shoot this gun a lot quicker...

02:04:36.210 --> 02:04:38.790
then both of you can jump.

02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:00.060
Not bad, doctor.

02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:01.820
That was close.

02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:03.730
But stand right where you are...

02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:06.450
or you get a slug in the gut.

02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:44.630
I was at the doctor when I heard
the radio call for Inspector Gruber...

02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:46.250
of course I came immediately.

02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:48.710
You say you were with him
this morning, Mr. Horak?

02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:53.590
Yes, you see the Inspector and I...

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.350
went to a cabaret last night.
Well, he stayed all night at my apartment

02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:59.140
When did he leave you?

02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:02.230
I should say about
10 o'clock this morning.

02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:05.690
- Did he happen to say where he was going?
- Yes, I believe he did.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:08.860
I think he mentioned he had an
appointment with a Mr. Czaka at his house.

02:06:09.070 --> 02:06:10.860
Where?

02:06:11.070 --> 02:06:13.150
Czaka's house.

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.450
Ritter, bring Herr Czaka around.

02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:18.660
Thank you, Mr. Horak.

02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:21.700
I'm sorry, but I have to hold you
like the other witnesses...

02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:24.540
until all of this is settled.

02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:43.730
Go to Czaka's house and see if
Gruber was there this morning.

02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:57.870
Mr. Czaka, when did you
last see Inspector Gruber?

02:06:59.830 --> 02:07:02.250
Yesterday afternoon.
Here at the Gestapo.

02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:05.710
And where were you this morning
from 10 o'clock on?

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.790
At home, until noon.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.670
And then two of Gruber's men came
to escort me to the Golden Quail.

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.720
Gruber wasn't with you before then?

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:19.550
No, I told you I haven't seen him at all today.

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.560
Excuse me.

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.520
Yes?

02:07:34.570 --> 02:07:36.450
Czaka...

02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:39.530
between 10 and 12 this morning...

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:42.120
Inspector Gruber
was with you...

02:07:42.330 --> 02:07:44.660
at your home.

02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:49.170
No, Herr Haas.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.800
- Who said that?
- Your butler.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:59.300
Why, Herr Haas,
that's impossible.

02:07:59.510 --> 02:08:00.970
The man can be insane.

02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:05.180
I demand to see him.
Face to face!

02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:10.230
At 10 o'clock this morning, when Inspector Gruber
arrived, I showed him into the study...

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.690
then Mr. Czaka sent me down to the
railway station for a timetable.

02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:16.900
Josef, where do you get these hallucinations,
haven't I always paid you well?

02:08:17.110 --> 02:08:20.620
- Why do you tell such lies?
- Will you kindly keep quiet Mr. Czaka?

02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:24.620
- Go on please.
- When I had returned, the Inspector had gone.

02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.710
- Where is the study?
- Right in there, but it's locked.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.500
After Mr. Czaka left, the maid wanted
to go in to clean...

02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:34.420
we couldn't find the key anywhere.

02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:36.760
Break the lock.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.470
Can't do that, it's an genuine antique.

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.990
That's Gruber's calling card.

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.490
Someone put them there!

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.410
Get the caretaker of the building!

02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:11.460
Timetable.

02:09:11.670 --> 02:09:13.420
Timetable?

02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:15.960
Switzerland.

02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:18.420
You said your butler had
hallucinations, Mr. Czaka?

02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:20.510
Your Excellency, I assure you I...

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.840
My desk!

02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:24.640
I protest!

02:09:24.850 --> 02:09:26.720
Checkbook.

02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.890
Czaka, this check for 10,000 marks...

02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.060
Whom did you give it to?

02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:35.820
To the Occupational Police fund.

02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.990
I'm not interested for what purpose you
gave the money, but to whom you gave it.

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:44.950
To Inspector Gruber.

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:47.080
Damned pig!

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.290
Yours, Mr. Czaka?

02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.590
No,I never had a gun.

02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:59.170
Herr Haas, this pistol was
made in England.

02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:02.550
The exact same caliber of the bullet
that killed the Reich Protector.

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.760
Impossible, Herr Haas!

02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:06.800
All of this is false,
completely false.

02:10:07.050 --> 02:10:09.720
If you only got Herr Gruber here, all
these accusations would be proven false.

02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:11.180
The whole thing is a frame up,
an awful frame up!

02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:14.480
Herr Fuhrer Standarten,
there is a mimeograph in closet.

02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.490
I'm innocence. I swear I am!

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:30.620
The underground planted all of this to
pin the assassination on me!

02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:32.500
Where is Haas?

02:10:32.710 --> 02:10:34.750
Herr Standarten Fuhrer!

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.050
Schirmer! Downstairs!

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:04.360
Miss Novotny,
you are free to go.

02:11:04.570 --> 02:11:06.320
Czaka was the assassin.

02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:09.580
We even found the gun in which
he shot Heydrich.

02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.620
The remaining hostages will be
released in the morning.

02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:16.210
Have you anyway of telling whether my father...?

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:17.500
No.

02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:21.050
This scum must have been working
for both sides all this time.

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:23.840
It looks like Gruber caught on to him
but couldn't be bribed.

02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:25.300
Not Gruber.

02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:28.010
So, Czaka had to get rid of him.

02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:38.020
Pull around the corner.

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:44.940
Czaka, get out of here.

02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:55.830
You're free, Czaka.

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.790
Free?

02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:01.040
- Free!
- Sure. Go on.

02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:03.750
Schirmer, I'll never forget you for this,
never forget you!

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.220
Go on! Run!

02:12:46.865 --> 02:12:47.812
Heil, Hitler!

02:12:50.608 --> 02:12:52.457
Excellency, this is the report
in code from Berlin.

02:13:34.452 --> 02:13:36.452
<i>Ever onward,
no returning...</i>

02:13:37.222 --> 02:13:39.293
<i>until the filthy butcher will be learning...</i>

02:13:39.925 --> 02:13:42.589
<i>this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.</i>

02:13:43.293 --> 02:13:47.021
<i>Carry on when we are gone.
No surrender!!</i>

02:13:48.342 --> 02:13:50.630
<i>No surrender!!</i>

02:13:51.764 --> 02:13:55.512
<i>NO SURRENDER !!</i>
