WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.435
- Have a great night, okay?
Because I am done.

00:03.471 --> 00:04.569
- What the hell is all this?

00:04.638 --> 00:06.704
- You're gorgeous.
- I'm taken.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.473
- What do you know about marc
the shark tremblay?

00:08.542 --> 00:11.476
- He's a dangerous guy.
Not to mention, a beast.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.312
- Well, stuart, it looks like
it's gonna be business after
all.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.648
- Business should
just be between members only.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.916
- I'd like stuart to join us.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.617
- Okay, jackie, listen to me.
Do you see naz?

00:19.653 --> 00:20.886
<i> - No, I tried to look for him,</i>

00:20.955 --> 00:22.320
But I don't see him anymore.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.923
- Hey-ho, detective!

00:24.992 --> 00:26.858
(crying out)

00:26.927 --> 00:29.227
- Police! Everybody stay where
you are!

00:30.264 --> 00:31.363
- Get him!

00:31.498 --> 00:32.764
(gunfire)

00:36.670 --> 00:37.802
- Cover the north exit.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.538
Tell backup to cover the south
when they get here.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.939
- Police!

00:40.941 --> 00:42.341
- Go, go, they went out
the side door!

00:42.476 --> 00:45.110
- This gang doesn't make sense
to me.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.547
Will calling the shots one day,
then this guy showing up? Mm-mm.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.348
- You really didn't have
to come.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.585
- I kind of did. I mean, I'm
still your emergency contact.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.191
(hip-hop music)

01:06.366 --> 01:09.301
- Can I help you? Hey, you!

01:10.304 --> 01:12.104
Are you gonna order something,
or what?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.339
(scoffing)
- what are you doing here?

01:14.408 --> 01:18.043
- I'm, uh, working, obviously.
And there's a lineup, so...

01:18.178 --> 01:20.712
- I didn't know you worked here.
- Yeah, it's my first day.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.946
- Wow.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.384
- Okay, so no coffee? Great.
Next!

01:26.420 --> 01:29.855
- No, no, no, no.
Uh, I want... Coffees. Um...

01:31.025 --> 01:33.958
I want coffee with you,
actually. Are you...?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.862
- Hey, boss.
This guy's harassing me.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.931
This guy's harassing me.
Do you mind kicking him out?

01:39.967 --> 01:41.499
- No, no, no!
- Is there a problem?

01:41.535 --> 01:42.834
- No.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.872
Yeah, actually, you might want
to watch out for her.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.340
Make sure she doesn't steal from
your cash register.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.543
She probably didn't put hustler
in her resumé.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.214
- Nope.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.217
- Hey.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.153
(sighing)
elliot, where's my coffee?
I gotta get to work.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.821
- Never mind, okay?
Can we just go?

02:03.858 --> 02:06.158
- No, I've been up for 37 hours,
I need a coffee.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.293
- Okay, mom, can we please--
- no, fine, I'll get it myself!

02:08.329 --> 02:10.429
(thudding)
- you're trying to ruin my life?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.364
- Elliot, maybe we...
We're gonna...

02:12.366 --> 02:14.099
Don't do any of
what you're gonna do.

02:14.168 --> 02:17.369
- Hey! I'm ruining your life?
- Yes.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.572
- How am I ruining your life?
- For making me fall for you.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.374
- What?!
- And then your mother

02:22.509 --> 02:24.509
Destroyed my entire family,

02:24.578 --> 02:27.445
And I'm the idiot for going to
dinner with your parents,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.447
And having believed
that they would actually think

02:29.517 --> 02:30.782
I'm a decent person...
- Okay, okay.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.050
- Because you made me
think that!

02:32.086 --> 02:34.118
You made me think that!
- Yeah, I loved you!

02:34.155 --> 02:35.654
I loved you!

02:36.924 --> 02:38.323
You promised me that
we were gonna pull it together,

02:38.458 --> 02:39.724
And we were gonna have
a normal life,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.093
And then you just took off
on me! And for what?!

02:42.129 --> 02:44.062
For the money!
- No!

02:45.032 --> 02:46.732
Yes, a little bit for
the money,

02:46.734 --> 02:48.733
I needed it for my mother,
but elliot,

02:48.769 --> 02:50.602
I am not a bad person.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.472
- I was trying to have a civil
conversation in there,

02:53.607 --> 02:54.873
But you wanted to be
an ass hole.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.407
- You treat me like a criminal,
elliot.

02:56.443 --> 02:59.111
- You are a criminal!
- So are you!

02:59.246 --> 03:01.213
You were right there with me
the entire time!

03:01.215 --> 03:04.315
- I left it behind!
- So did I!

03:05.619 --> 03:06.884
Why do you think I'm standing
here in this stupid hat

03:06.921 --> 03:08.954
And this stupid apron?!
- Jackie.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.823
You can take off the stupid hat
and the stupid apron,

03:11.892 --> 03:13.291
Because you're fired.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.294
- Ha. Ha!

03:17.631 --> 03:19.097
Awesome.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.500
I guess I'm gonna go back to
dealing drugs, then.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.969
- Yeah, good.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.411
- Elliot, she did help save--
- nah, I don't care.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.581
<i> ♪ pump up the jam,</i>
<i> pump it up ♪</i>

03:36.584 --> 03:38.216
<i> ♪ pump it up, yo,</i>
<i> pump it ♪</i>

03:38.252 --> 03:40.385
<i> ♪ pump up the jam,</i>
<i> pump it up ♪</i>

03:40.387 --> 03:42.020
<i> ♪ pump it up, yo,</i>
<i> pump it ♪</i>

03:42.089 --> 03:46.191
- Babe, I am heading...
Back in.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.726
(blender whirring)

03:49.530 --> 03:52.497
My gosh, it's so hard to work
on just two hours' sleep.

03:53.667 --> 03:58.270
But... That's why they pay me
the medium bucks.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.672
(chuckling)

04:04.611 --> 04:06.745
Uh, okay.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.147
Uh, what's wrong?

04:12.185 --> 04:14.352
- I just got off the phone with
my handler.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.754
She's coming down on me hard.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.625
Told your team of yahoos all of
this the other night.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.761
- Okay, wait, wait, len.
There's no need to name call.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.064
(fist thudding)
- why not? Hmm?

04:26.066 --> 04:28.166
Y'all went into that party
under-prepared.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.502
You arrested my guy
for minor possession charges!

04:31.538 --> 04:32.737
- Do not--

04:33.874 --> 04:35.307
Do not yell at me.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.844
(distant siren wailing)

04:39.880 --> 04:41.045
(sighing)

04:41.081 --> 04:42.347
- Sorry.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.616
I risked a lot for this case,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.186
And I just don't want it
to be for nothing.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.856
- But it's not for nothing!
It's not-- we...

04:51.892 --> 04:53.525
We're so close.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.461
So close to breaking up this
coyote alliance!

04:56.596 --> 04:58.930
And it's not just a few bikers!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.067
No, this group connects
every gang,

05:02.202 --> 05:05.537
Every organized crime system
that we know of.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.940
- But you didn't loop me in.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.009
- We--
- hey, hey, hey.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.945
You and your ex, greene,
were real tight,

05:14.081 --> 05:15.547
But it's like you didn't
want me there.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.649
- That is not what happened,
okay?

05:20.254 --> 05:22.220
Look, how was I supposed to know
that marc tremblay

05:22.289 --> 05:23.355
Was going to be at
that party?

05:24.658 --> 05:27.292
- It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.829
(sighing)
it's just stress.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.497
- Yeah.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.032
- I can deal with it.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.103
(kissing)
I can deal with it.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.907
(sighing)

05:44.111 --> 05:46.210
(indistinct chattering)

05:48.182 --> 05:51.049
- We get anywhere?
- Not yet.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.052
Spin team still working.
No hits on will or adeline.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.321
- We don't have any leads
on bishop either,

05:56.390 --> 05:58.656
So my intuition is saying
that will french

05:58.726 --> 06:00.192
Is the key
to the coyote puzzle,

06:00.327 --> 06:01.660
And that we have to find him.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.194
- The question is how?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.730
The guy's completely
disappeared.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.431
- Yo, whaddup, though?

06:06.566 --> 06:08.500
- Oh!
- Hey!

06:08.569 --> 06:11.636
- Hey, there he is!
- How you feeling, man?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.606
- Well, I'm never playing
golf again, I'll tell you that
much.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.874
- Aw...

06:17.677 --> 06:19.010
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.445
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.048
- Sam, you hungry?
There's burgers and fries,
there's a salad.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.883
- Uh, thank you, but no
thank you,

06:24.885 --> 06:27.018
'cause I promised my mom
that I would have lunch with
her today.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.586
- Oh, okay.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.957
I thought I might see you at
the hospital.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.892
- Yeah. Um...

06:34.928 --> 06:36.761
I sent you a text.

06:36.764 --> 06:40.031
I just, I thought that you would
have, like, a lot of visitors.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.435
- Well, I didn't.
Just a couple of grouchy nurses.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.304
- Oh. Wow.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.706
That's kind of surprising.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.875
- Duff. Wazowski. Office.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.412
(sighing)

06:55.482 --> 06:59.250
So... Was it worth it?
- Excuse me?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.986
- Your rooftop bust?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.588
An operation I did not
authorize, just to be clear.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.224
Anything to show for it?

07:06.226 --> 07:10.595
We're supposed to be arresting
an organized crime syndicate,

07:10.597 --> 07:12.129
Not the high school prom.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.333
- We learned the coyote alliance
is real.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.003
They have members
from the mafia, street gangs,

07:18.005 --> 07:20.071
Biker gangs, mexican gangs,

07:20.207 --> 07:23.641
All working a side hustle that
makes up the coyotes.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.877
We also learned...

07:25.879 --> 07:27.278
That will french is at
the heart of it.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.213
- And mr. French, where
is he now?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.515
- We don't know.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.418
- Listen, we have teams on
his house, on his businesses,

07:34.455 --> 07:38.022
And there's no action on
his credit cards his finances...

07:38.091 --> 07:39.958
- I see. Okay.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.629
I'm taking this over,
and thank you in advance,

07:44.665 --> 07:46.431
But I'll be putting my own team
together.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.366
- Sir, we understand your
frustration, we do.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.268
We share it in fact, but...

07:51.839 --> 07:54.706
We got a lot of promising leads.
Just give us another day.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.941
- To do what, exactly?
Arrest more innocent people?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.376
Endanger more lives?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.378
- They all weren't innocent,
per se.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.013
- To bring in will french.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.651
The coyote boss on a platter
to you, sir.

08:08.989 --> 08:13.859
- One day, 24 hours,
starting...

08:15.863 --> 08:16.928
Now?

08:21.401 --> 08:23.468
- Will french on a platter,
really?

08:23.470 --> 08:25.270
Given that he's disappeared
into thin air?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.138
- Well... I blame you!

08:27.207 --> 08:30.408
You're the one who taught me
to kiss ass and make empty
promises.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.978
- Michael says that he's taking
over the case tomorrow

08:33.113 --> 08:34.378
Unless we bring him
something solid.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.314
(sighing)

08:36.449 --> 08:39.150
- Nathan, you...
You got something?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.152
- I keep thinking about
marc the shark.

08:42.088 --> 08:43.621
He's a known coyote associate,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.757
We have him in a cell
not talking.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.825
Maybe we can crack him.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.829
- No, no, no. That'll put a nail
in the coffin on len's case.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.064
- Len's case is dead anyway.
I'll handle it.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.265
I'm not scared of len.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.368
He's coming to talk to us now.
You all stay on adeline.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.303
We'll let you know if we make
any headway.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.906
(sighing)

09:03.977 --> 09:06.878
- Yeah, sergeant, I'm not happy
about this either.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.912
(scoffing)

09:08.916 --> 09:10.048
- I've already talked to
your superiors.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.017
- I'm aware.
- Your detectives were clear

09:12.152 --> 09:13.785
That tremblay was len's mark,

09:13.920 --> 09:15.453
So they were supposed
to be hands off.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.456
- Yeah. It's like they wanted
to sabotage my case.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.591
Like this one here had
a personal beef.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.993
- Are you serious right now?

09:22.029 --> 09:23.294
- Uh, greene...

09:25.332 --> 09:28.466
Tremblay was doing blow with
a crowd of people,

09:28.468 --> 09:31.469
All of whom my detectives
understandably arrested.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.940
If they had ignored him, it
would've tweaked something for
the guy, don't you think?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.208
- Okay, but once they realized
tremblay was there,

09:37.210 --> 09:38.543
They should've aborted
the operation.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.279
- Listen, if my guys came in

09:41.348 --> 09:43.348
And asked me to bust up
a biker party,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.549
I would've said, "back off."

09:45.586 --> 09:48.285
But your guy walked
into the middle of their
investigation.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.754
That's not on us.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.557
So now, I'm gonna have to
ask you to back off.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.029
- So, what now?

09:58.164 --> 10:00.264
Can you release him so I can,
I don't know,

10:00.334 --> 10:01.566
Try to repair this mess?

10:03.736 --> 10:05.170
Guys, you got him on a minor
possession charge,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.505
He's not gonna talk for that.
- My two cents?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.642
You're working a guy who's more
wrapped up with the coyotes

10:10.644 --> 10:11.642
Than the bikers.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.445
- We know that marc uses
his satellite phone

10:13.580 --> 10:14.979
To communicate with
these guys.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.382
If we can get him to give up
will's pin, we'd be good to go.

10:17.517 --> 10:21.919
- Like I said, he's not going to
give up that kind of gas.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.322
Especially now
that he's been busted.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.991
His guys are gonna be
all over him like flies.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.660
- Maybe that's how we get him.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.063
We make him think
the jupiters are on to him,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.665
Maybe he starts looking
for protection.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.466
- Okay... How will you pull
that off?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.268
- We let him sweat it out
a little longer.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.671
Send in a sketchy dude.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.206
Make him feel like the bikers
put out a hit on him.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.808
Maybe then he starts talking.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.243
- One thing I know about marc,
he's paranoid as hell.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.080
- Where do we get a sketchy
dude?

10:49.116 --> 10:50.915
- There's lots of sketchy dudes
around here.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.317
This is the police force.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.354
(rhythmic music)

11:03.163 --> 11:05.563
- I've been slaving over
this for frittata.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.233
You need to enjoy every single
morsel, no rushing back to work!

11:09.269 --> 11:10.769
- I know.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.503
(knocking)

11:13.506 --> 11:15.106
- You need to spend quality time
with me.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.976
Every day is a blessing
when you get to be our age.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.978
- What, I'm lumped in with
your age now?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.579
(rapid knocking)

11:22.783 --> 11:23.915
Hey.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.785
(panting)
- adeline french.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.988
An off-duty cop spotted her
outside skippers' tackle box
in barrie.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.857
Thought he recognized her
from the apb.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.493
Look at this.
- I told them to look up north!

11:36.663 --> 11:38.262
Will french has a fishing cabin
on bass lake.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.664
If I was gonna hide out,
that's exactly where I would be.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.167
- Yeah.
- Road trip, okay.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.468
This is gonna be amazing.
I just gotta grab a few things.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.506
- Hey, kelly, I'm sorry...
- Oh no.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.475
- ...But sam has other plans.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.076
We're gonna sit down and
eat lunch,

11:52.079 --> 11:54.445
And talk about the podcast.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.480
- What podcast?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.750
- The podcast I sent you last
night. Brené brown,

11:58.819 --> 12:01.285
Vulnerability,
owning your own story.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.489
- Oh! Yeah, so like,
I didn't, uh, listen to it.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.158
- Jesus, samantha!
I'm trying to share, here!

12:07.194 --> 12:09.393
- No, you know what?
I'll probably...

12:09.429 --> 12:11.896
Yeah, I'll listen to it
on the road.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.565
- Road to where?

12:13.700 --> 12:18.369
- The road to catching
a drug kingpin, god willing.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.173
- Could you please go on
that road a little bit later?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.776
I've been alone for
two days now.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.710
- Mom, I love you.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.913
I do, I really do, but...

12:28.982 --> 12:31.249
If you're gonna stay here
for any longer,

12:31.251 --> 12:34.118
You really have to find someone
else to talk to besides me.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.254
- Oh, well aren't I the lonely
loser?

12:36.389 --> 12:40.258
- Well, welcome to the club,
because I feel like that every
day. I'm sorry. Okay!

12:40.260 --> 12:41.526
Let's go.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.264
(door buzzing)

12:46.266 --> 12:48.465
(chuckling)
- finally, you idiots grew
a brain.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.869
- Uh, no, sorry.
You're getting company.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.403
(chuckling)

12:54.107 --> 12:55.473
Alright, in you go.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.074
- Hey!

12:59.146 --> 13:00.611
(chuckling)

13:04.617 --> 13:05.549
Yeah...

13:06.686 --> 13:08.719
Okay, okay, yeah.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.022
(sighing)

13:12.125 --> 13:13.491
- What's your problem,
dickhead?

13:15.128 --> 13:18.629
- Sorry about that, cousin.
Just had a vision.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.300
Little men everywhere.
Am I right?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.468
- What?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.504
- Am I right?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.872
Hey.

13:29.709 --> 13:34.445
When I say they're little,
I mean they look like giants!

13:34.514 --> 13:39.149
But when they're little in here,
and they're little in here,

13:40.119 --> 13:42.320
I just see tiny, tiny men.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.990
Traitors are little.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.460
When you're little
like that,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.863
It's easy to squash you like
a humming bird.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.866
You ever squash a humming bird?

13:54.868 --> 13:57.468
<i> (marc): Okay, bro.</i>
<i> Just go over there--</i>

13:57.604 --> 13:59.771
- Impressed. Didn't know
the brother had it in him.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.408
- Yeah. He's a versatile guy.
- Mmm.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.078
You guys are tight,
you and nathan?

14:08.114 --> 14:10.981
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Guess I'm the bad guy, huh?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.285
- Look, man, we all just want
kelly to be happy.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.953
- Me too.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.288
(nathan speaking indistinctly)

14:17.357 --> 14:19.223
I love that woman.
- Good.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.624
'cause she's the real deal.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.859
<i> (marc): You're insane.</i>

14:21.994 --> 14:25.897
<i>(nathan): Wallets pay me gold to</i>
<i> squash the hummingbirds.</i>

14:25.899 --> 14:30.001
They can't do it themselves,
so they pay big man.

14:30.070 --> 14:34.505
Big man up here.
Take out the traitors.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.975
Big man need money too,
you know?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.311
Dolla, dolla bill, yo.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.580
- Wait.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.983
Are you saying that someone put
you in here to get at me?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.017
- Alright, that's my cue.
- Yeah.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.989
<i> (nathan): Hush, little baby.</i>
<i> Don't say a word.</i>

14:50.991 --> 14:52.991
- 'cause I didn't do a thing,
I'm not a traitor.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.694
- Whether you did or you didn't,
they think you did.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.666
- Guard! It's getting a little
crowded in here.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.902
- Marc.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.408
How you doing?

15:12.712 --> 15:15.213
- You're a cop.
- Sorry, man.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.695
- Okay, what road music would
you like?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.230
- Your call.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.433
- Uh... Okay,
<i> tainted love?</i>

15:35.568 --> 15:37.702
Or
<i> total eclipse of the heart?</i>

15:37.771 --> 15:39.570
- Mmm... Very different vibes.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.973
- That is the great thing about
love songs, you know?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.108
Uh, you can have tortured,
you can have happy,

15:44.110 --> 15:45.676
We got blues, we got pop.
You know what?

15:45.745 --> 15:48.646
It's very much like how
the greeks have six different
words for love.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.181
There's eros, there's philia,
there's agape, there's pragma...

15:51.217 --> 15:53.317
- If you're gonna be giving me
a seminar on the greek language,

15:53.353 --> 15:55.252
What's the point of listening
to music?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.388
- You know, I can very easily
do both.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.458
(chuckling)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.660
- Okay, let me ask you this...
- Okay.

16:02.729 --> 16:06.964
- What's the point of packing
a tote bag for a two-hour drive
up north?

16:07.934 --> 16:09.801
- Mmm. What a detectrice
you are. Well,

16:09.936 --> 16:12.669
'cause it's a two-hour
drive there, who knows how long
we're gonna be there?

16:12.706 --> 16:14.738
And it's a two-hour drive back,
we're gonna need things like
snacks,

16:14.774 --> 16:17.175
Sunblock, bug spray, zoloft,
a charger--

16:17.177 --> 16:18.443
- Ah.
(snapping)

16:18.578 --> 16:21.012
Didn't know you took zoloft.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.448
What is that for?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.816
- Nothing.
- Uh-huh.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.152
- Anxiety, you know?
Work, will french,

16:28.287 --> 16:29.887
Stretch marks,
they really get me down.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.824
Elliot, that's a good one.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.091
Naz...

16:34.227 --> 16:36.828
You know, just like,
lots of different stuff.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.496
It's purely situational.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.565
I started taking it after
steve left.

16:40.700 --> 16:45.302
- So... Steve left
ten years ago.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.240
- I saw naz at the hospital
with his ex.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.577
They were hugging closely.
- Oh.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.645
- He lied about it.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.981
(sighing)
- naz...

16:57.050 --> 16:59.950
- I said that I didn't see
them together.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.319
I lied right back, I--

17:03.489 --> 17:04.856
I just, I panicked.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.458
Maybe he still has feelings
for her.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.794
You know what? Maybe...

17:10.797 --> 17:12.797
That's okay, that's fine,
that's cool.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.132
And I still have, like residual
love for steve,

17:15.201 --> 17:16.534
Maybe that's what he...

17:18.638 --> 17:20.871
Maybe that's what he feels
for angie. It's just...

17:21.875 --> 17:23.408
It's just a different
kind of love.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.144
- I can help you, alright?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.279
You cooperate,
I'll get you a deal.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.714
- Get out of here,
alright?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.483
I'm not squealing.
What do I look like?

17:33.252 --> 17:34.552
- Okay.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.753
I'll leave you here.
You two have a good night.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.356
(nathan chuckling)
- wait!

17:41.561 --> 17:43.494
Do people think
that I said something?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.363
Because I didn't tell you
a damn thing.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.168
- Marc, come on. You know
you told me a thing or two.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.702
(chuckling)

17:53.339 --> 17:56.473
- Alright.
Just get me out of here.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.985
- Okay, slow down, slow down.
The cabin...

18:07.987 --> 18:09.987
Should be right up there.
Oh, yep, there it is.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.556
Okay, pull over. Pull over,
we can watch from here.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.260
- That must be adeline's car.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.631
I don't see will's anywhere.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.069
- Should I go knock on the door?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.005
- No, I think we should
wait it out.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.339
Maybe will will show up.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.275
But I'll text the station,
let 'em know we're here.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.444
- You know what?
If we're gonna sit here...

18:33.579 --> 18:34.945
(window whirring)

18:34.981 --> 18:38.015
I am rolling down this window so
we can smell this fresh air.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.350
Smell that!
(insect buzzing)

18:39.352 --> 18:40.885
- Mmm... Ouch!
(smacking)

18:44.891 --> 18:46.958
(light music)

18:47.093 --> 18:49.227
- Hey, um... Can I speak
to your manager

18:49.229 --> 18:51.195
For like two minutes, please?

18:52.398 --> 18:55.099
- Jimmy!
- Thank you.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.705
Hey, man. Listen, I'm really
sorry about this morning,

19:00.707 --> 19:03.774
But I just think you made
a huge mistake firing jackie.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.179
That whole scene that I caused
was completely my fault,

19:08.248 --> 19:09.647
She had nothing to do with it,

19:09.782 --> 19:11.281
She was defending herself,
you know?

19:12.585 --> 19:15.786
I'm not sure if you know this,
but you had the smartest,

19:15.855 --> 19:19.122
Most hard-working person making
coffee for you,

19:19.159 --> 19:20.391
And you let her go.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.993
I just, I'd really appreciate it
if you could call her

19:23.029 --> 19:25.095
And give her her job back
in the morning, or...

19:27.066 --> 19:29.534
(chuckling)
hey.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.168
- Hi, um...

19:32.539 --> 19:35.473
I already actually came back
and begged him for my job back.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.041
He decided to give me another
chance, but thank you.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.811
- Cool, um... Yeah, no,
I just,

19:40.813 --> 19:43.647
I didn't want to leave
town knowing I screwed you
out of a job.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.550
- Wait, you're leaving?
Where you going?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.785
- Halifax. I'm...

19:48.821 --> 19:50.821
Yeah, I'm going to school,
so...

19:51.791 --> 19:52.923
I'm heading out on a plane
tonight.

19:52.992 --> 19:56.293
(scoffing)
- wow!

19:57.564 --> 20:02.033
Hey, that's so awesome, elliot!
I'm so happy for you.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.901
- Jackie? Back to work.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.239
- Back to work.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.778
- I'll never love anybody like
I loved you.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.181
It just hurts too much.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.453
- "you are my one and only,

20:22.455 --> 20:25.189
And I will never love
anyone again."

20:25.258 --> 20:28.726
That kind of overly dramatic
love, now, that is pure eros.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.028
It's like teenagers, it's wild,
it's completely irrational.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.098
Very, very different from
pragma, okay?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.933
That is like a longstanding
love.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.402
That is like, way more mature,
pragmatic,

20:38.404 --> 20:39.670
You know,
as the name suggests.

20:39.805 --> 20:42.339
- You're still watching, right?
- Yeah, of course, you can rest.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.942
- Philia, that's like, you know,
comradery.

20:45.979 --> 20:48.279
Sisters in arms on
the battlefield type love.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.147
It's friends, it's like...

20:50.216 --> 20:51.615
Yeah, it's like close friends.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.550
And then my favourite
is philautia,

20:53.620 --> 20:55.820
Which is love of the self,
which is like--

20:55.955 --> 20:59.023
- Like vibrator love?
- No, not vibrator--

20:59.025 --> 21:00.357
- Like...
(buzzing, moaning)

21:00.426 --> 21:02.493
- No, it's not like that.
You know, it could be, though.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.762
It could be, because it means
compassion of the self. What?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.630
(gasping)
oh my gosh, she's coming over.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.165
She's gonna recognize you
from the boat.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.734
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What should we do?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.369
- It's fine, just go handle it.
- How?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.470
- I don't know, just go!
- Okay.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.575
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.511
- Can I help you?
- Sorry.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.713
We just got turned around,
so we pulled over,

21:22.848 --> 21:24.181
So we could just look
at the map.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.716
- Did will send you?

21:25.752 --> 21:28.286
- I'm sorry, I don't know
who will is.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.053
- Then who are you and what
do you want?

21:31.724 --> 21:33.524
- You know what, I'm just gonna
be straight with you,

21:33.593 --> 21:35.292
Even though it might backfire.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.893
Um... We...

21:37.563 --> 21:39.863
My wife and I, uh...

21:41.234 --> 21:44.568
We want your cabin, so...

21:44.637 --> 21:48.272
If you're wanting to sell it?
You wanna give me a call?

21:48.274 --> 21:50.141
We've had our eye on it
for years.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.776
Listen, honest-to-goodness,
it is our dream getaway.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.045
- This crap shack?
- That's the one.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.215
- Wow. That's a pretty
low bar.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.552
Well, since you're here,
do you want to come in and
take a look around?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.520
- Really? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.423
- Okay.
- Is she coming, or what?

22:05.558 --> 22:09.426
- No, she doesn't, she's shy.
So... She's also asleep.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.095
- Well, I'll wake her up.
- She won't like that.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.797
- Wifey!

22:17.503 --> 22:18.769
You coming?

22:20.740 --> 22:21.806
- Yeah.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.308
Oh.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.451
- Welcome....

22:33.453 --> 22:35.585
To my dysfunctional childhood.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.455
- Oh my gosh.
This place is gorgeous.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.990
- Cooler, anybody?

22:40.827 --> 22:43.260
I don't like to drink alone.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.528
- Oh, thanks.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.330
- I mean, obviously,
I find a way.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.466
- So, do you own
this place by yourself?

22:48.601 --> 22:51.802
- No. I mean, my brother and I,
we inherited it together.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.605
'cause my father used to come up
here to get away from my mom.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.408
He'd bring us along.
We'd gut fish.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.809
You know, it was every
girl's dream.

22:58.845 --> 23:01.745
- Is your brother interested
in... Selling?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.481
- Will can be very nostalgic,

23:03.483 --> 23:06.750
But I would love
to get rid of the place.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.019
How long have you two
been married?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.954
- Oh, 10.
- Oh, three, but...

23:10.990 --> 23:12.356
But it feels like 10.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.957
But, like, in a really...
In a nice way.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.258
We were actually just talking
about love

23:15.294 --> 23:17.161
In our relationship as...
(clearing throat)

23:17.230 --> 23:20.364
Based on, um,
long-term commitments, mature.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.532
- Oh, lesbian bed death?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.202
- Mm, that's not a thing.
- No, I jest.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.505
I jest. I actually find lesbians
very interesting in bed.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.541
- Well, we certainly know
our way around the old...

23:31.577 --> 23:32.977
Female genitalia.

23:32.979 --> 23:36.580
- So, if you... Hate it here,

23:36.715 --> 23:38.048
Why do you still come up?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.683
- I just...

23:40.620 --> 23:42.319
To get away.

23:42.355 --> 23:43.787
Life's stressing me out.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.789
- Oh, really?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.123
How come?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.126
- Um, business,

23:49.261 --> 23:50.394
Stuff with my brother.

23:50.529 --> 23:51.995
'cause he can be
a right asshole.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.532
He's... Condescending,

23:54.534 --> 23:57.001
He's cocky, he's controlling.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.203
I mean, all the c words.
And he thinks I'm stupid.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.538
But he thinks wrong.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.740
- So, what sort of business
do you do?

24:02.742 --> 24:04.942
(vehicle approaching)
- oh, christ.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.644
Uh... That's my brother.

24:08.714 --> 24:09.914
If he finds out I'm trying
to sell the place

24:09.916 --> 24:12.149
Behind his back, he's gonna...
He's gonna he's kill me.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.417
- Oh, you know what? It's okay.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.885
We can just go out the back.
No worries.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.954
- No, no, no, no.
Two minutes. Two minutes?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.622
- No, um--
- in that room right there.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.624
- I don't know about that.
- Just give me two minutes.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.293
- No, we can just go out the...
The back.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.827
- It's fine.
I'm gonna get rid of him.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.195
- Oh, okay.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.297
(panting)

24:29.635 --> 24:31.969
We have been looking
for this guy for days!

24:32.038 --> 24:33.637
- Wait, wait!
- We should go and arrest him!

24:33.772 --> 24:36.040
(phone vibrating)
- okay, yes! The midland police

24:36.042 --> 24:37.374
Are on their way.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.311
Plus I-I left my gun in the car
and I don't have a gun,

24:40.446 --> 24:42.512
So I just really think
we should wait for backup!

24:42.548 --> 24:44.581
- What do you mean,
you left your gun in the car?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.383
- She was watching! Not gonna
be like, just a second,

24:46.452 --> 24:48.452
Reach over, pull my gun out!
Plus I had to spin a yarn

24:48.521 --> 24:50.120
About our sexless
lesbian marriage.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.655
- Well, I got mine.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.058
We know this guy is armed.
We know he's dangerous!

24:54.060 --> 24:56.126
- Exactly. He's dangerous.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.661
(distant chattering)
so for now, we are just

24:57.796 --> 24:59.062
Gonna listen.
Maybe we learn something

24:59.098 --> 25:00.464
And we wait for backup.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.132
(will): Why aren't you
answering your phone?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.801
(adeline): Because I don't
like talking to you!

25:03.936 --> 25:05.201
(will): I don't care!

25:05.238 --> 25:07.004
- Okay, they're saying
something about getting played

25:07.073 --> 25:08.606
Or flayed or laid. I'm not sure.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.741
- How much longer for backup?
- Twelve minutes.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.743
(thudding, adeline screaming)

25:12.745 --> 25:13.977
- Are you kidding me?

25:15.414 --> 25:17.781
(door rattling)

25:19.685 --> 25:21.718
(kelly grunting)
- duff, let me try.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.557
Ow. Yeah, you know what?
You were right. Okay.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.626
Adeline! Adeline, are you okay?!

25:29.662 --> 25:31.328
(car tires screeching)
- nothing.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.097
Let's find a way
to get outta here.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.965
- You know what?
There's gotta be another door.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.967
There's always another door
in these old fishing cabins.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.636
- You're an expert
on fishing cabins now?!

25:38.771 --> 25:40.371
- I spent many a summer
on a lake with my--

25:40.506 --> 25:41.905
- I don't want to hear
a goddamn word

25:41.941 --> 25:44.174
About your goddamn uncle!
You do realize it's your fault

25:44.176 --> 25:45.308
We're in this mess, right?

25:45.344 --> 25:46.977
I had my gun!

25:47.013 --> 25:48.111
I was ready to arrest the guy!

25:48.180 --> 25:50.180
But no! You had to play it safe,

25:50.182 --> 25:52.582
Play by the rules,
wait for backup!

25:52.618 --> 25:54.050
- I get it!

25:54.086 --> 25:55.852
Okay? I get it.
It's all my fault.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.589
Cool kelly and scrupulous sam,
'twas ever thus. Are you done?

25:58.591 --> 26:00.123
'cause there's a lot more
useful things

26:00.192 --> 26:01.792
You could be doing right now!

26:01.794 --> 26:03.927
- Ears!
(gunshots)

26:08.000 --> 26:09.399
- I'm not sure
that was one of them.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.801
- Argh!

26:10.870 --> 26:12.970
I don't know
why I ever listen to you!

26:12.972 --> 26:15.072
- You don't listen to me.
Sometimes you defer to me,

26:15.207 --> 26:16.874
But you do not listen to me.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.176
- That's not true!
When do I not listen?!

26:19.311 --> 26:20.810
- Oh, I dunno! Len?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.880
(soft music)

26:25.551 --> 26:28.819
I warned you about going back
to a toxic well with that guy.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.289
What'd you do? Oh, you just
stopped talking to me.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.891
And then you got engaged to him!

26:34.927 --> 26:36.092
- 'cause that wasn't
your business!

26:36.128 --> 26:38.762
- You made it my business
when you told me about him!

26:38.831 --> 26:40.497
When you asked me to step in

26:40.499 --> 26:42.166
If you ever started
to fall for him.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.101
When you became my friend,

26:44.170 --> 26:46.036
You made it my business!

26:46.038 --> 26:47.705
Do you not see that?!

26:47.840 --> 26:51.441
You know what? Listen.
You think that I am so stunted

26:51.510 --> 26:53.177
When it comes to friendship,
but you wouldn't know

26:53.312 --> 26:55.179
True philia if it hit you
in the side of the head!

26:55.314 --> 26:57.181
And here's the thing...
(straining)

26:57.183 --> 26:59.582
...About not talking
to your friends!

26:59.619 --> 27:01.184
(objects thudding)

27:02.888 --> 27:04.588
You don't get to know
what I know!

27:05.524 --> 27:07.257
- Yeah, well, what do you know?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.060
- Gabrielle and nathan broke up!

27:10.195 --> 27:11.928
Naz told me last week!

27:12.931 --> 27:14.865
- S-sam, are you...
Are you serious?

27:16.201 --> 27:17.867
Sam.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.102
Sam!

27:20.205 --> 27:21.405
Are you serious?

27:21.540 --> 27:23.339
- Weird. Why are they trying
to hide this freezer?

27:23.376 --> 27:25.008
- Wazowski!

27:25.011 --> 27:26.143
(groaning)

27:27.213 --> 27:29.213
(gasping)
- oh.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.015
- Wazowski?

27:35.955 --> 27:38.088
Oh, boy.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.295
Body looks fully frozen.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.033
- You think will brought him
up here to kill him

27:50.102 --> 27:51.402
After the shakedown with naz?

27:51.537 --> 27:53.036
(sighing)
- says a lot if will's got

27:53.105 --> 27:54.438
The balls to kill a cartel guy.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.440
- Toolbox, toolbox!
It's through the hole,

27:56.442 --> 27:57.974
On the left.
Just go, go, go, go.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.242
- Yeah, okay.
(grunting)

27:59.278 --> 28:01.644
Hold on. Toolbox, toolbox,
toolbox....

28:01.681 --> 28:04.280
Ha! Here. Here.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.383
- I got it.
- Alright.

28:07.420 --> 28:11.154
See? And that is me listening.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.861
(sirens wailing in distance)

28:20.265 --> 28:22.266
(grunting)
oh, yeah.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.268
(vehicles approaching)
- okay.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.737
- Will's car's still here.
I'll check the cabin!

28:26.739 --> 28:29.072
- Okay. Hey, we need to put
an apb out

28:29.141 --> 28:30.607
On adeline french's car.
- Okay.

28:30.743 --> 28:31.875
- You need to go
through this cabin,

28:32.010 --> 28:33.610
Dust it and take
everything of interest.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.279
- Okay.
- Okay, call cib,

28:35.414 --> 28:37.147
Because there's a dead body
in the freezer.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.281
- You mean, like, cut up?

28:38.317 --> 28:39.582
- No, there's, like,
this really big freezer

28:39.618 --> 28:41.017
In the cellar,
so the body's fully intact.

28:41.053 --> 28:41.985
You're welcome.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.556
- Place is empty.
She's not there. Let's go.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.758
- Hey, also, the victim's name
is bishop logan.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.726
Our team's gonna be here
within the hour.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.529
<i> - And you've been a member</i>
<i> of the sons of jupiter</i>

28:52.565 --> 28:53.831
<i> For about 15 years?</i>

28:53.966 --> 28:56.299
<i> - Probably 20. I dunno.</i>

28:56.335 --> 28:57.901
<i> - Got your full patch in '08?</i>

28:58.036 --> 29:00.303
(scoffing)
- some damn fine acting chops

29:00.372 --> 29:01.704
You got there, sir.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.308
- This guy's jumpy,
so it didn't take much.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.042
- Yeah. Probably didn't help
that his bestie

29:06.078 --> 29:07.510
Turned out to be a cop too.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.313
- What is it, a side hustle?

29:09.315 --> 29:10.914
Or are you sort of, I dunno,

29:11.049 --> 29:12.983
Brokering between
the two organizations?

29:12.985 --> 29:14.984
- The jupiters won't mess
with the cartel.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.521
I tried to organize a talk,

29:17.523 --> 29:19.056
But my road captain
just shut it down.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.125
- You working with them
on the sneak?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.060
- So what if I am?

29:23.195 --> 29:24.661
You can't judge me, man.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.263
I thought we were tight.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.333
You coming over to my house,
eating all my food,

29:30.402 --> 29:31.735
Going on about francesca.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.137
What is she gonna do
when she finds out

29:33.272 --> 29:34.337
You're getting married?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.406
Are you even engaged?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.208
<i> - Yeah. I am.</i>

29:38.244 --> 29:39.910
<i> - Does francesca</i>
<i> know you're a cop,</i>

29:40.045 --> 29:42.345
<i> Or have been you faking it</i>
<i> with her this entire time too?</i>

29:42.381 --> 29:44.281
- Tell me, what do you know
about the coyotes? Hmm?

29:44.350 --> 29:45.816
- You sure had her fooled, man.

29:47.085 --> 29:49.753
You had us all fooled. Frances--
- listen to me.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.755
You need to worry about
yourself right now.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.761
I can get you a deal,
protection, all of that.

29:57.763 --> 29:59.162
But you gotta start singing.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.566
<i> Will's satellite-phone pin,</i>
<i> you know it?</i>

30:03.769 --> 30:06.303
- Did we just find out
that len has a girlfriend

30:06.438 --> 30:07.838
As part of his undercover play?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.405
- That's what it sounds like.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.443
- Why did adeline scream, duff?

30:13.445 --> 30:15.512
I mean, she sounded like
she was being attacked. Okay.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.915
Okay, one: Will killed
bishop and his sister.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.450
Two: Will killed bishop,
and his sister was in on it.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.986
Three: Will killed bishop
and his sister had an idea and--

30:23.121 --> 30:25.889
- When did, uh,
nathan and gabrielle break up?

30:26.024 --> 30:27.691
- Are you kidding me? What?

30:27.693 --> 30:29.092
- I mean--
- now you're interested?

30:29.094 --> 30:31.795
This is some serious friendship
currency here, okay?

30:31.930 --> 30:33.129
This is what friends do,

30:33.199 --> 30:34.998
And we are professional
colleagues.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.934
You see, gossip is good.
I've always told you that.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.669
It's a sharing of information,
an evolutionary tool.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.270
They broke up last week.
Apparently, it was mutual.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.005
(phone vibrating)

30:42.007 --> 30:42.806
- Hey.
- Wow...

30:42.875 --> 30:44.207
<i> - Hey. Good news.</i>

30:44.210 --> 30:46.209
Mark gave us will's
satellite phone pin.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.946
We can use that to turn on
the gps remotely and track him.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.148
Where are you guys?
- Sheppard and kingston road.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.950
Do we have backup ready
for dispatch?

30:52.952 --> 30:54.952
<i> (naz): We do.</i>
- Okay, let's do it.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.887
- Hi. Anna? It's nathan.
Yeah, we're ready to roll.

30:59.058 --> 31:02.526
41-22-12-2

31:02.528 --> 31:05.561
And 3-26-10-5.

31:06.565 --> 31:10.100
Okay.
I'm seeing 134a gibson lane?

31:10.102 --> 31:11.635
Okay, great.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.038
Thank you. Yeah, sure.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.907
I'd love to take you out
for a drink.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.575
Let's make it happen.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.377
(scoffing)
- hey.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.912
Okay, missy jeal-e-ous,

31:22.047 --> 31:23.513
Focus on the ring
on that finger.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.182
134a gibson lane.
We're headed there now.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.651
- Whatever.
(tires screeching)

31:27.653 --> 31:29.386
(horns honking)

31:32.157 --> 31:33.423
(tense music)

31:38.130 --> 31:40.530
Got your gun this time?
- Yeah, I got my gun.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.401
Police!
- Go, go! Police!

31:44.403 --> 31:46.136
Identify yourself!

31:46.205 --> 31:48.404
Again, identify yourself!

31:48.440 --> 31:49.739
- Duff, look.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.541
- Adeline's booze cans.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.281
Sam? Get the kit.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.384
It's in the trunk.
Looks like he od'ed. Buddy?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.953
Buddy, can you hear me?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.428
Hang on, will.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.066
He's still breathing.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.234
Come on, sam, hurry up.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.869
(weakly): Balda.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.103
(wheezing)

32:21.573 --> 32:23.139
Bitch is crazy.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.409
- Will, who's balda?

32:25.411 --> 32:26.776
Who's the bitch? Who's crazy?

32:26.812 --> 32:28.278
- She did this.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.113
(breathing heavily)

32:30.182 --> 32:31.314
Not me.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.216
- Where's adeline? Wi-will?

32:34.286 --> 32:36.153
Will, keep talking.
Come on, keep talking!

32:36.155 --> 32:38.655
Hurry, sam.
He's not breathing.

32:39.324 --> 32:40.523
- Okay.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.792
Ready?
- Yeah.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.004
(groaning)

32:54.006 --> 32:55.271
- Hey.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.341
I'm detective--
- samantha wazowski, I know.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.810
And right now you're stomping
all over a homicide

33:00.879 --> 33:03.813
Or suicide scene
in your excellent sneakers.

33:03.882 --> 33:06.016
I'm gonna have to ask you
and your partner, kelly duff,

33:06.018 --> 33:06.950
To skedaddle.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.352
- We, uh, should give you
a statement.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.221
We were here when he died.
He said something--

33:11.223 --> 33:13.590
- Zip it. We approach
every scene with an open mind.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.692
We can't have amateur theories
muddying the water.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.827
(scoffing)
- we get it.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.294
Your minds need to be empty,
hollow vessels.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.096
- An echo chamber of sorts.
- Mm.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.197
- You're catching on.
- Yeah.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.866
- Now, I need you both
to tiptoe your asses

33:23.001 --> 33:24.334
Outta here.
- Huh.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.535
- Good luck.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.306
- That's more of a<i> pas de barré,</i>
but okay.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.181
- Kelly, I need to talk to you.

33:38.984 --> 33:41.051
- Sam already told me.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.685
You and gabrielle broke up.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.887
I'm sorry.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.125
I'm really sorry, nathan,
but...

33:49.194 --> 33:52.195
I'm engaged now and I can't
confuse myself emotionally--

33:52.231 --> 33:54.664
- I know, but I--
- hey, hey!

33:54.666 --> 33:56.466
There she is. My baby!

33:56.502 --> 33:58.234
Come here, come here, come here.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.405
Oh, we made real progress today,
yeah?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.039
- Yeah, we did.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.743
Too bad we didn't get
to will before balda did,

34:06.812 --> 34:08.144
Whoever that is.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.714
- Alright, let's go home.
Come on.

34:10.716 --> 34:11.882
- You alright, nathan?

34:12.017 --> 34:14.750
- Yep. Yep, great.
Have a good night.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.819
- Okay.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.626
- Hey, sam in there?

34:23.662 --> 34:25.261
- Uh, no, I think she went home.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.631
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.299
- Without saying good night?

34:29.301 --> 34:32.569
- A bit of advice?
Honesty will never do you wrong.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.108
(indistinct chattering)

34:38.243 --> 34:41.378
- Tonight, my treat.
Jerk chicken, huh?

34:43.248 --> 34:45.715
- Hey, there's snacks
for you guys.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.117
- Thank you.
- Extra cheese.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.052
Okay. Listen.
Did you pack the extra soap

34:49.121 --> 34:50.186
And toothpaste that I got you?

34:50.322 --> 34:51.654
- Yeah.
- And then I sent your comforter

34:51.723 --> 34:52.923
And your matching shams
to residence--

34:53.058 --> 34:54.324
- Hey.

34:54.459 --> 34:55.792
I got it.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.327
I'm gonna be okay.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.261
- Yeah.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.331
I'm not sad.
I'm not sad. I promise.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.667
- Okay, kiddo. You're gonna
miss your plane. Alright?

35:03.669 --> 35:05.135
- Okay, let's do this.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.005
- You can't leave!
You can't leave!

35:12.611 --> 35:15.244
Not without saying
a proper goodbye.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.487
- Remember when we felt
love like that?

35:24.523 --> 35:27.423
- Yeah. It was horrible.
- It really was.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.893
- Thank god we numbed with age.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.361
- Crusted.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.562
I think the word is "crusted."

35:32.697 --> 35:34.197
- I'll think about you
every day, okay?

35:34.332 --> 35:35.464
- Oh...

35:36.168 --> 35:37.733
Only if it motivates you.

35:39.671 --> 35:42.105
I love you so much,
it's killing me.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.739
- Don't say that.
(jackie crying)

35:44.610 --> 35:46.309
I need you in the world.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.076

to clear the air

37:26.211 --> 37:27.743
About a few things.

Full honesty, alright?

Never do me wrong?

37:32.684 --> 37:35.318
- Oh. Okay.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.221
- When I started
this undercover play...

37:40.359 --> 37:43.092
I needed to get in deep
with these guys fast.

37:44.496 --> 37:47.030
I ended up bumping this homegirl
that was tight with marc.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.765
She was his nutritionist.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.034
(chuckling)
she was married,

37:51.036 --> 37:53.303
Wanted a little something
on the side.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.304
Well...

37:55.173 --> 37:56.573
It was the quickest way in, kel.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.974
But then she left her husband

37:59.011 --> 38:01.110
And I couldn't just
shut her out cold.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.846
I had to keep it going
just until--

38:02.981 --> 38:06.583
- Wait. Wait. Stop.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.584
Um...

38:08.654 --> 38:10.319
Are you telling me...

38:10.355 --> 38:12.254
That you got a girl
you been sleeping with?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.457
(scoffing)
- it's undercover.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.394
It's not real.
- No, len.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.733
It's still real.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.372
- I haven't slept with her
in a while.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.508
- In a while. Wow.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.908
Um...

38:34.079 --> 38:35.277
Have you been sleeping with her

38:35.314 --> 38:36.946
Since you've been
sleeping with me?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.950
- Not since you put on my ring.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.886
- Wait.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.154
Wait.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.090
(chuckling)
wait, wait, wait.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.525
- Kel, I needed
to keep it going.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.227
Hey, come on, kelly.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.363
You know the stakes
around these things.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.964
- You...

38:55.100 --> 38:56.900
Had to do drugs

38:57.035 --> 38:58.835
In order to work
your undercover plays.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.772
You had to be an asshole
to work your undercover plays.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.208
(sighing)

39:05.277 --> 39:06.842
You know, I need you
to get your stuff

39:06.878 --> 39:08.978
And get the hell out. Now.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.780
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen, kelly, come on.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.382
This is why I'm coming clean.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.016
- Len?! Len!
- Hey.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.285
- No.

39:17.589 --> 39:20.189
I don't know
what I was thinking, but...

39:21.660 --> 39:24.928
I'm not doing this.
I do not want to do this.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.330
- Yes, you do. Yes you do.
- No! No.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.599
I don't.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.203
(ring tinkling)

39:34.172 --> 39:35.704
We're done.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.675
For real, len.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.313
<i> (judy): Samantha,</i>
<i>I took your cue and got a life.</i>

39:43.448 --> 39:45.949

39:49.421 --> 39:50.753
<i> (laughing)</i>

39:50.822 --> 39:52.488
<i> Don't wait up!</i>

39:59.131 --> 40:00.963
(knocking)

40:02.134 --> 40:03.833
- Uh, god.

40:09.507 --> 40:12.575
Hi. You are interrupting
my movie night.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.511
'cause I got all
my creature comforts.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.647
I got chips, wine, cookies,
sandra bullock movies...

40:20.752 --> 40:22.385
Are you okay?

40:25.056 --> 40:27.924
(kelly sighing)
I'm sorry.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.060
- I knew I couldn't trust him.

40:31.196 --> 40:34.597
I knew it was too good
to be true.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.165
Everyone knew it.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.935
And yet,

40:39.004 --> 40:41.271
I let him convince me
that things had changed.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.473
- Because you wanted it.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.808
(kelly sighing)
because you loved him.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.409
- Did I?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.280
Do I?

40:52.017 --> 40:54.416
Or do I love the idea?

40:54.453 --> 40:56.151
Because...

40:56.188 --> 40:58.220
I love the idea, sam, so much.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.022
I love the idea.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.426
The two of us working together,

41:03.561 --> 41:05.495
Having a family, having a home.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.865
Growing old together.
I love the idea.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.970
Why do I love that idea?

41:14.039 --> 41:17.907
- Because it is a beautiful...
Idea.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.178
Just because you are strong,

41:22.180 --> 41:23.646
You're so strong,

41:23.781 --> 41:24.847
An independent woman,

41:24.883 --> 41:26.649
It doesn't mean
you can't wish for that.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.186
I love that idea too.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.922
- Why did it feel so right...

41:32.958 --> 41:34.523
With len?

41:35.460 --> 41:36.860
- Because it was familiar.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.730
The brain just really likes
things that are familiar.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.933
Just... Familiar
isn't necessarily good.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.468
- Yeah.
(sam chuckling)

41:45.603 --> 41:48.004
Like... Nathan?

41:50.074 --> 41:51.674
He's good.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.743
He's really good.
- Yeah.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.045
(sighing)

41:56.081 --> 41:58.548
- And he is certainly
unfamiliar.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.219
Why didn't I let that happen?

42:03.354 --> 42:06.155
- Well, you know
when you've been on the water

42:06.224 --> 42:08.558
For a long time,
you just get used to things

42:08.560 --> 42:12.428
Being uneven, and then when
you get back on even ground...

42:12.497 --> 42:14.297
You feel dizzy.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.299
You just...

42:16.434 --> 42:18.100
Needed to find your sea legs.

42:20.171 --> 42:21.670
- Yeah.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.376
The philia love,

42:27.412 --> 42:30.113
That's the friendship one,
right?

42:30.248 --> 42:32.114
- Yes, that is correct.
- Right.

42:32.150 --> 42:35.051
- Um, comrades
on the battlefield loyalty.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.186
- Right.
- Yeah.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.988
- I don't think
that's the word for us.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.256
(chuckling)
I think we're more...

42:42.927 --> 42:45.027
Scylla.
- No, scylla's...

42:47.866 --> 42:49.365
We're scylla.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.201
I love it. It's even better.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.071
- I love skelly.

42:55.206 --> 42:57.006
- I love skelly, too.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.709
♪ rip it out when it hurts you ♪

43:01.546 --> 43:03.079

43:08.153 --> 43:10.086
