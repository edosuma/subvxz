# Now once upon a time
They sang the vo-dee-o-doe

00:21.755 --> 00:24.708
# But that was long ago

00:24.923 --> 00:28.423
# Then everybody started in
To boop-boop-a-doop

00:28.636 --> 00:31.756
# They got tired of that, you know

00:31.973 --> 00:36.137
# But the tune for you and me...

00:41.858 --> 00:43.897
Very unnecessary.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.269
# ls that swinging symphony

00:46.488 --> 00:51.826
# They called it inka dinka dee
A dinka doo a dinka dee

00:52.076 --> 00:56.538
# Oh, what a tune for croonin'

00:57.373 --> 01:02.083
# lnka dinka dee a dinka doo a dinka dee

01:02.296 --> 01:06.708
# lt's got the whole world swoonin'

01:06.925 --> 01:09.842
# Eskimo belles up in...

01:10.145 --> 01:13.395
Let me hear those trumpets.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.693
That's not a trumpet.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.745
That's not a trumpet.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.327
That's a trumpet.

01:24.502 --> 01:28.998
# lnka dinka dee a dinka doo a dinka dee

01:29.215 --> 01:32.299
# Simply means a dinka dee a dinka doo

01:34.387 --> 01:37.257
# lnka dinka a dee a dinka doo

01:37.473 --> 01:39.929
Let me hear my symphony!

01:42.270 --> 01:43.681
What a band!

01:43.897 --> 01:48.724
# lnka dinka dinks
A dinka dinks a dinka dee

01:48.944 --> 01:53.072
# lt's got the whole world swoonin'...

01:53.782 --> 01:57.068
I'm walkin' down the street...

01:57.286 --> 01:59.526
I'm walkin' down the street...

02:03.541 --> 02:08.121
[high-pitched elongated notes]

02:09.130 --> 02:12.878
Tell me, Mr James,
now, just what did you accomplish?

02:14.385 --> 02:20.009
# lnka dinka dee a dinka doo a dinka dee...

02:20.226 --> 02:23.559
# Eee...

02:23.771 --> 02:28.765
That note was given to me by Bing
Crosby. And was he glad to get rid of it!

02:30.110 --> 02:33.277
# lnka dinka dee a dinka doo #

03:05.979 --> 03:10.143
Boys. Time to get up. Come on.

03:11.610 --> 03:14.066
It's Saturday. We've got to get going.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.732
- Where are we going?
- We're going to see my uncle Joe.

03:17.950 --> 03:20.406
What? I don't want to go to Uncle Joe's!

03:20.619 --> 03:23.620
- Come here!
- I don't wanna go!

03:23.831 --> 03:26.952
No, I want to watch my cartoons!
It's Saturday!

03:27.168 --> 03:29.493
You can't make us! We don't wanna go!

03:29.713 --> 03:32.832
- Stop it!
- No, we don't wanna go!

03:33.048 --> 03:38.921
We'll be good! We'll eat anything.
We'll clean our room. But no Uncle Joe.

03:39.139 --> 03:41.012
We don't have time for this.

03:41.224 --> 03:44.178
- Leave us alone!
- You wouldn't hurt Daddy.

03:48.481 --> 03:51.186
- It's early, Carl.
- I want to get there first.

03:51.401 --> 03:56.823
Whoever gets there first talks about you
until there's no point you even being there.

03:57.032 --> 03:59.403
Try to bring up Tina's drinking.

03:59.617 --> 04:02.287
- She's your cousin.
- You're more subtle.

04:11.505 --> 04:12.915
[buzzer]

04:13.131 --> 04:15.420
Carl and Nora McTeague.

04:21.515 --> 04:23.638
Welcome to hell.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.995
- Are we first, Douglas?
- Indeed, sir.

04:53.213 --> 04:57.046
No one else had the presence of mind
to be three hours early.

04:58.719 --> 05:03.215
- May I take your bird, madam?
- No, we'll give it to him ourselves.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.757
Care to wait in the drawing-room?

05:05.976 --> 05:10.685
- There was another car out front. Who...?
- Dr Hemmel is with your uncle.

05:10.898 --> 05:12.357
Anything wrong?

05:12.566 --> 05:16.611
Your uncle was coughing
most of the night, sir.

05:16.821 --> 05:19.692
What kind of cough? Was it dry or liquidy?

05:19.907 --> 05:24.368
It was just a cough, sir.
Next time I'll save you a sample.

05:26.372 --> 05:28.412
[plopping sound]

05:35.506 --> 05:37.416
He'll really like the bird.

05:37.634 --> 05:42.177
- It cost us $400, Carl.
- You have to spend money to make money.

05:42.389 --> 05:45.840
- Oh, my heavens!
- Yolanda, what's wrong?

05:46.058 --> 05:47.434
He's dead!

05:49.103 --> 05:54.181
One minute the doctor was examining him
and he say he was fine, and then...

05:55.694 --> 05:57.485
- He's dead.
- Come quickly!

05:57.696 --> 05:59.320
Yes!

05:59.531 --> 06:01.737
- [boy] Are we rich?
- [Carl] Maybe.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.782
Oh, my God.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.670
[Yolanda wails]

06:13.878 --> 06:16.452
Yolanda, go clean something.

06:21.178 --> 06:23.052
Stop that!

06:29.395 --> 06:31.102
It's Dr Hemmel!

06:31.313 --> 06:33.769
Of course it's Dr Hemmel.

06:33.982 --> 06:38.940
He used to brag how he got up at 5am
to play racket-ball at 71 years old.

06:39.154 --> 06:41.527
You don't hear him bragging now.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.649
[Uncle Joe chuckles]

06:43.867 --> 06:46.441
Truth be known, we are so relieved.

06:46.662 --> 06:49.414
When Yolanda came in screaming,
we thought...

06:49.624 --> 06:54.202
Well, all I can say is we're glad
you're still with us, Uncle Joe.

06:54.419 --> 06:59.462
- You look thrilled.
- We are. Especially the boys. Joe and Joe.

06:59.675 --> 07:04.302
Look, another little Joe in the oven.
Here's a doctor's note to prove it.

07:04.514 --> 07:07.763
- You look nice, Nora.
- Thanks, Uncle Joe. So do you.

07:07.975 --> 07:11.641
- Why don't we just cut the cable?
- It's too thick. Come on.

07:11.854 --> 07:14.559
Did you hear that? He said you look nice.

07:14.774 --> 07:18.724
- I think that's a good sign.
- I don't know what to think.

07:18.945 --> 07:21.649
Carl, I want a girl, honey.

07:21.864 --> 07:26.194
All right. I swear, after he's dead
we'll have a girl, I promise. OK?

07:34.293 --> 07:38.042
Uncle Joe?
Wanted to tell you about something.

07:38.256 --> 07:40.829
You should see how Big Joe...our Big Joe,

07:41.050 --> 07:44.088
what a head for business he has
at nine years old.

07:44.304 --> 07:47.470
He organised a lawn-mowing company
with fourth-graders.

07:47.682 --> 07:52.226
He's preparing himself in case he has to
take over a big business some day.

07:52.437 --> 07:54.476
So you're interested in money, huh?

07:54.689 --> 07:57.263
Uh-huh. Made ten bucks just coming here.

07:58.735 --> 08:01.023
I get another 20 if I kiss you.

08:02.405 --> 08:04.943
I'm thinking about it.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.702
All right.

08:12.583 --> 08:13.958
That's it.

08:24.762 --> 08:28.260
- What happened? Is he...?
- Coronary. He died instantly.

08:28.473 --> 08:32.258
- Really? You mean just...?
- And he left everything to you, sis.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.182
- Really?
- It wasn't him. It was Dr Hemmel.

08:35.397 --> 08:36.808
You son of a bitch.

08:37.025 --> 08:41.650
- You wish it was the old man, don't you?
- I did. Now I wish it was you.

08:41.861 --> 08:46.191
- How are your girls, Ed?
- Yes, we have girls. You know why?

08:46.409 --> 08:52.613
We wouldn't put Ed's sperm in a centrifuge
to separate the X's from the Y's!

08:52.831 --> 08:55.867
Brother, no matter how much
Uncle Joe is worth,

08:56.085 --> 08:59.371
there is a line below which we will not go.

08:59.588 --> 09:02.673
Jolene, Joette? Let's go in, girls.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.342
- We saw an ambulance!
- Dr Hemmel died.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.680
Ah.

09:12.852 --> 09:17.182
[makes flatulence sounds]

09:30.245 --> 09:33.909
Dennis, why don't you go and sit
at the kids' table?

09:34.124 --> 09:35.666
Make me.

09:45.010 --> 09:48.876
- Are you retarded?
- Not according to the tests.

09:49.097 --> 09:51.386
You just sit here and shut up.

09:51.599 --> 09:52.928
[starts again]

09:54.978 --> 09:57.185
- Yolanda!
- It's all over the place!

09:57.398 --> 10:01.062
He has a cold, Uncle Joe.
He didn't want you to get sick.

10:01.276 --> 10:03.601
Ed, your girls knocked over some milk.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.652
Well, Uncle Joe, I guess
you'll have to find a new doctor.

10:07.866 --> 10:12.612
What for? Doctors, medicine.
Who needs 'em, huh?

10:12.830 --> 10:16.199
You know who you should talk to
about this? Glen.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.086
This man keeps in shape. It's discipline.

10:19.295 --> 10:22.996
I exercise for a couple of weeks, that's it.
I admire you.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.380
Well, you know...

10:28.596 --> 10:31.265
Could you fit all your exercise equipment
into your new apartment?

10:31.474 --> 10:33.632
Frank!

10:35.645 --> 10:39.477
- What new apartment?
- Glen and Muriel are separa...

10:39.691 --> 10:41.931
That was a secret. I feel horrible.

10:42.151 --> 10:45.650
- I could cut out my tongue.
- Here's a knife.

10:45.863 --> 10:49.315
- No, really, I'm...
- You split up?

10:49.534 --> 10:51.574
No.

10:51.786 --> 10:54.110
- No!
- No!

10:54.330 --> 10:57.497
- Then why...?
- It's...

11:02.213 --> 11:08.086
You know I'm starting that new business?
Well, it takes a lot of time and energy,

11:08.302 --> 11:13.130
and when I'm with J... Muriel, I just...

11:13.350 --> 11:18.344
I am so crazy about her
that all I can think about is...

11:22.066 --> 11:25.400
- You know.
- Yeah.

11:25.612 --> 11:31.485
So I thought I'd move out for a while
and I'd be able to get some work done.

11:31.702 --> 11:33.990
[flatulence sounds]

11:35.038 --> 11:40.079
It's nobody's business what you two do.
You have no kids. You're both barren.

11:40.293 --> 11:45.833
Frank, I almost forgot to ask you.
How is Tina's hit-and-run case coming?

11:47.133 --> 11:49.209
- Hit-and-run case?
- Yeah.

11:49.427 --> 11:52.963
When Tina got drunk
and ploughed into that school bus?

11:53.182 --> 11:56.136
Ploughed? She just scraped paint off it.

11:56.351 --> 11:59.638
The brakes failed. Everyone was fine.
The kids, the nuns.

11:59.856 --> 12:05.229
I just thank God she wasn't in one of
those little sports cars like your girlfriend's.

12:05.444 --> 12:07.982
- They're death-traps.
- What?

12:08.197 --> 12:11.032
His girlfriend drives a Chrysler.
Big blue one.

12:11.242 --> 12:14.111
She's not my girlfriend!

12:16.830 --> 12:19.452
She's an instructor at the gym. I met...

12:19.666 --> 12:24.294
I left my gym bag at the gym
and she was bringing it back to me.

12:27.092 --> 12:31.966
I guess you have time to notice
these things now that you're not working.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.134
What happened?

12:35.349 --> 12:37.093
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

12:37.309 --> 12:40.145
There was a little cutback at Ed's place.

12:40.355 --> 12:43.272
They let go of some of the employees
that were...

12:43.482 --> 12:46.898
Selling company secrets.
Pass the butter, please.

12:47.112 --> 12:50.148
That's a lie and I'll prove it in court!

12:50.365 --> 12:53.282
- This Friday, right?
- We got a continuance.

12:53.493 --> 12:56.862
The court dockets were too filled
with drunk-driving cases.

12:57.079 --> 12:59.155
I skidded on a wet spot!

12:59.374 --> 13:02.541
- Somebody get her a drink.
- Get her a barrel.

13:02.752 --> 13:06.038
Please. Why must this happen
every time we get together?

13:06.256 --> 13:09.340
Can't this man have peace?
Hasn't he earned it?

13:09.550 --> 13:13.844
Delivering newspapers at four years old,
his little toes frozen.

13:14.055 --> 13:18.100
- It's all right.
- No. We've lost our sense of values.

13:18.309 --> 13:22.770
Maybe it's not mine to say, but
Nora and I... Come up here, sweetie...

13:22.981 --> 13:27.358
and Joseph and Jonas and little Josiah
on the way...we lead a simple life.

13:27.569 --> 13:30.570
We have each other,
and what the heck else is there?

13:30.781 --> 13:33.153
Joe-Joe, I'm just going to the market.

13:33.367 --> 13:34.397
Oh!

13:34.617 --> 13:37.286
Molly! Come here.

13:39.664 --> 13:44.493
These are my nieces and nephews.
Everyone, this is Molly.

13:44.712 --> 13:47.250
- Hi!
- Hi.

13:48.548 --> 13:52.083
- You wanted to see me?
- Would you buy some Oreos?

13:52.302 --> 13:56.347
We wouldn't be out of Oreos
if somebody hadn't eaten the insides

13:56.557 --> 13:59.594
and tossed the rest away,
you naughty boy.

13:59.810 --> 14:02.763
I'm old and rich.
I'll eat whatever parts I want.

14:02.979 --> 14:07.143
- If I want to eat the goddamn box, I will.
- Who wound you up today?

14:07.360 --> 14:10.563
- Better give me some money, then.
- Here.

14:12.448 --> 14:16.231
Take an extra hundred.
You might see something you want.

14:16.451 --> 14:19.655
You are such a dear.

14:19.872 --> 14:21.746
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

14:21.957 --> 14:23.997
Toodles!

14:40.310 --> 14:43.263
These are good melons. Yeah.

14:45.773 --> 14:47.565
Sweet, juicy.

14:47.775 --> 14:49.186
- Uncle Joe?
- Mm?

14:49.402 --> 14:51.146
- Who...?
- Mm?

14:52.239 --> 14:56.983
- Who...?
- Oh, that's Molly. She's living here.

14:57.201 --> 15:00.618
Housekeeper? Secretary?

15:00.830 --> 15:04.745
Well, not exactly. She's sort of...my nurse.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.621
- Nurse?
- Yeah. I decided I wanted a nurse.

15:12.843 --> 15:16.046
Someone to ease my suffering.

15:16.262 --> 15:18.006
An agency sent her?

15:18.223 --> 15:21.508
No, she delivered a pizza one night
and we got to talking.

15:21.726 --> 15:27.765
Turns out she'd like to be a nurse, so...
Yeah, she helps out in various ways.

15:31.236 --> 15:34.071
She's become very special to me.

15:54.509 --> 15:56.337
[cheering]

15:56.679 --> 15:59.135
Yeah!

16:02.434 --> 16:04.474
[inaudible]

16:23.038 --> 16:26.657
Thank you, Fred.
Hello, everyone. I'm Chris Schenkel.

16:28.502 --> 16:31.254
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:31.463 --> 16:33.503
On behalf of the Pro Bowlers Tour,

16:33.716 --> 16:37.299
we'd like to thank the people
of Milwaukee for their support.

16:37.512 --> 16:41.296
The top five qualifiers tomorrow
will begin play at 2.30.

16:41.516 --> 16:43.057
Shit.

16:44.143 --> 16:47.761
[female] You do this every time!
You ruin every vacation.

16:47.981 --> 16:51.764
- [male] Shut up!
- [female] It's always ''Let's drive a little further.''

16:51.985 --> 16:55.732
[female] Then there's no place to stay
and we wind up in a shithole!

16:55.947 --> 16:58.865
This is...this is unbelievable.

16:59.075 --> 17:01.114
Everywhere I stay, I'm next to this couple.

17:01.327 --> 17:02.738
[crockery smashes]

17:02.955 --> 17:05.624
Not literally them,
but people just like them.

17:05.833 --> 17:08.867
- It's like a franchise.
- [male] You made my life hell!

17:09.085 --> 17:12.251
- [female] Kiss my ass!
- [male] That would take all night!

17:12.464 --> 17:14.502
[door slams]

17:16.426 --> 17:18.549
Oh, God.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.511
You know, this is really stupid.

17:22.723 --> 17:26.590
ABC gives me a suite at the Marriott
and we're at the Bates Motel.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.140
Let's get out of here.

17:28.355 --> 17:31.855
Honey, you know
I get embarrassed at your hotel.

17:32.067 --> 17:36.776
Everyone always says, ''How's a schlep
like McTeague afford the Marriott?''

17:36.989 --> 17:40.322
''He sleeps with Robin Hunter,
the telecast producer.''

17:40.534 --> 17:44.579
''Really? He must screw better
than he bowls.''

17:44.788 --> 17:47.161
I do, don't I?

17:48.292 --> 17:51.992
I can't take it, Robin. I can't do it any more.

17:52.212 --> 17:54.370
What?

17:55.591 --> 17:58.509
- I'm giving up bowling.
- Why?

17:58.720 --> 18:04.306
My wrist. It's a pre-arthritic condition
and it's not going to get better.

18:04.516 --> 18:08.680
- You saw a doctor?
- No, Al the janitor at the bowling alley.

18:08.896 --> 18:11.897
He seemed to know his stuff
and took me right away.

18:12.108 --> 18:14.729
Of course I saw a doctor!

18:14.986 --> 18:19.030
I don't know. Cincinnati's
the last tournament of the season.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.573
I'm just going to bowl there and...that's it.

18:24.829 --> 18:26.905
Sweetheart.

18:33.671 --> 18:35.498
I'm sorry.

18:35.715 --> 18:40.424
I just wish for once
I could've finished in the top five,

18:41.513 --> 18:45.592
gotten on the national telecast just once.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.848
That would have been nice.

18:50.605 --> 18:53.891
- What are you going to do?
- Well...

18:54.109 --> 18:58.605
some guys offered to make me a partner
in this new bowling centre.

18:58.822 --> 19:03.069
They offered me 25% interest
for a 1 0% investment, 'cause I'd run it.

19:03.284 --> 19:04.743
It's a good deal.

19:04.953 --> 19:08.323
- It's great.
- Only I don't have the cash.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.078
- They want 300,000.
- Phew!

19:11.292 --> 19:14.958
So then I thought
maybe I'd be happy teaching.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.500
Yeah?

19:16.715 --> 19:23.085
Only, then you'd always
make more money than me.

19:23.305 --> 19:26.306
Who cares about that crap?
If you're happy teaching,

19:26.516 --> 19:31.013
then that makes me happy.
That's it. That's all there is.

19:34.316 --> 19:39.441
Her name is Molly Richardson.
She's 24 years old. She's English.

19:39.655 --> 19:43.605
She came here two years ago
as a nanny for a couple named Holcomb.

19:43.826 --> 19:48.821
When Mrs Holcomb eventually fired her,
Mr Holcomb attempted to kill himself.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.368
God.

19:50.582 --> 19:54.532
She bounced from job to job:
bikini model, physical therapist...

19:54.753 --> 19:57.873
- We're dead.
- ..until she started delivering pizzas.

19:58.090 --> 19:59.418
It pays to have skills.

19:59.634 --> 20:04.793
She moved in with Joe about three weeks
ago and she's been there ever since.

20:05.014 --> 20:06.473
As a nurse?

20:06.682 --> 20:09.885
She seems to spend
most of her time swimming.

20:10.978 --> 20:14.430
- In the nude. Here are some pictures.
- What?

20:15.650 --> 20:18.401
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

20:18.611 --> 20:22.194
- Are they having sex?
- Grow up. What do you think?

20:22.406 --> 20:24.649
She's going to get everything.

20:27.162 --> 20:31.111
That's the way these old guys are.
Biggest son of a bitch ever:

20:31.332 --> 20:35.200
she touches his old noodle
and his brains turn to frozen yoghurt.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.748
You would know.

20:36.963 --> 20:40.213
She'll screw him six feet under
and get everything.

20:40.426 --> 20:44.505
That's our money, and no English bitch
is gonna screw us out of it.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.426
Are they sleeping together?
Is there proof?

20:47.640 --> 20:51.970
- I need more time.
- They're humping too quick for pictures?

20:52.187 --> 20:55.521
- Let's get a better detective.
- How do we know you're any good?

20:55.733 --> 20:58.982
She found out you were fired
and that Glen left Muriel.

20:59.193 --> 21:03.026
My guy knew about Tina
while the car was still spinning.

21:03.239 --> 21:08.116
Yeah? Look at these pictures she got
of Glen and that gym instructor.

21:08.328 --> 21:10.866
Yeah.

21:12.915 --> 21:13.947
That's not me.

21:14.167 --> 21:17.288
It looks like you
and that's all that matters.

21:17.504 --> 21:22.001
- Use your gun!
- Glen, cut it out! Come here. Stop it.

21:22.217 --> 21:25.882
Stop it!
Don't you see what's happening here?

21:26.096 --> 21:28.054
Yeah, you're out of Scotch.

21:28.265 --> 21:31.017
Oh, Tina, go lie down.

21:31.227 --> 21:35.935
We caused this. All the backbiting
and the greed and the detectives.

21:36.149 --> 21:40.477
We've made each other look filthy.
Now it's come home to roost.

21:40.694 --> 21:43.316
Not one of us has the credibility

21:43.531 --> 21:47.031
to convince Uncle Joe that this girl
is just after his money.

21:47.243 --> 21:51.454
It's not our fault! It's his.
Sweet old Uncle Joe.

21:51.663 --> 21:55.079
We were all decent people
till he got his hooks into us.

21:55.293 --> 21:58.626
Except for Frank.
Frank was always a son of a bitch.

21:58.838 --> 22:03.630
It's true. Uncle Joe does this to us.
He pulls our strings and makes us dance.

22:03.842 --> 22:05.301
He's the devil.

22:05.511 --> 22:09.295
Every time you draw a line in the dirt
and say, ''No farther,''

22:09.515 --> 22:12.885
he draws one an inch farther
and you say, ''Why not?''

22:13.103 --> 22:15.142
''I've come this far already.''

22:15.355 --> 22:18.605
Then you look back
and can't even see where you started.

22:18.816 --> 22:22.601
Why don't we all stop here?
Let this bimbo have his money.

22:22.820 --> 22:25.394
Isn't our self-respect
worth more than any inheritance?

22:26.658 --> 22:27.653
No.

22:27.868 --> 22:32.861
Ed, we're just people. Nobody could
walk away from that much money.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.789
Daniel did.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.288
Who's Daniel?

22:38.503 --> 22:40.662
- Our cousin.
- What happened to him?

22:40.881 --> 22:46.171
He called Uncle Joe a mean, greedy, cruel,
grasping, evil, manipulative old man.

22:46.386 --> 22:49.969
- We all did.
- But Daniel said it to his face.

22:51.141 --> 22:52.517
Grapes.

22:52.726 --> 22:54.553
- What?
- They were having grapes.

22:54.769 --> 22:58.434
Daniel started screaming
about oppressed migrant workers.

22:58.648 --> 23:02.480
Joe said the workers could
go screw themselves in Macy's window

23:02.694 --> 23:04.983
and Daniel let him have it.

23:05.197 --> 23:08.780
I'll never forget it. Remember the look
on the old man's face?

23:08.993 --> 23:11.233
He died a little that night.

23:11.453 --> 23:17.787
Daniel went away. He just went away.
Took his wife and son and...

23:18.001 --> 23:20.374
Man, did we hate his son.

23:20.587 --> 23:24.454
- How come?
- He was so cute, you know?

23:24.674 --> 23:27.344
You wanted to smash his little face in.

23:27.552 --> 23:30.257
- Where is he now?
- In Brazil or somewhere,

23:30.473 --> 23:32.798
saving the rainforest or shit like that.

23:33.016 --> 23:37.560
His wife died a few years ago,
and young Daniel's some kind of athlete.

23:37.771 --> 23:41.983
- A bowler, I think.
- Could we find him?

23:44.112 --> 23:46.270
[crowd cheering]

23:49.075 --> 23:50.616
Excuse me.

23:59.752 --> 24:02.457
Wayne, come here. What's happening?

24:02.672 --> 24:05.506
I've never seen him like this.
He's in the zone.

24:05.717 --> 24:08.801
- Where does he stand? What's...?
- Right now, fifth.

24:09.011 --> 24:12.926
- You mean he could be on TV tomorrow?
- Looks that way.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.528
- Yeah.
- I am on fire!

24:27.739 --> 24:29.282
- You're fifth.
- I know!

24:29.491 --> 24:31.946
If I tell you something,
will you be nervous?

24:32.160 --> 24:33.903
- No way. I'm in the zone.
- OK.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.739
I can turn the telecast
into an enormous break for you.

24:37.957 --> 24:41.706
I can build a whole show around you.
''Cinderella Man''.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.043
Even if you lose the first match.

24:44.255 --> 24:48.088
Chris will interview you,
you'll be funny, charming...

24:48.301 --> 24:51.587
Next year you could be wearing
an ABC blazer.

24:51.805 --> 24:53.430
Ooh, I got a chubby.

24:53.641 --> 24:56.725
You've got to finish no worse than fifth.

24:56.935 --> 24:59.686
I'm in the zone. I'm up.

25:00.939 --> 25:03.146
[girl in crowd] Come on, Danny!

25:04.526 --> 25:06.353
Ha!

25:16.789 --> 25:18.828
[crowd goes wild]

25:30.553 --> 25:32.592
Yes!

25:54.118 --> 25:55.992
[crowd] Oh!

25:56.204 --> 25:59.121
- [man] Come on!
- [man] What's he doing?

25:59.332 --> 26:02.951
- Danny.
- It's nothing. I just lost my line a little.

26:03.170 --> 26:08.376
- Petraglia just finished with a 289.
- What? So?

26:08.591 --> 26:12.340
So you're still OK.
You're still fifth, but it's close.

26:16.225 --> 26:19.225
- All right. So what do I need?
- OK, last frame.

26:19.435 --> 26:22.721
- You need a mark and a three count.
- Strike or a spare?

26:22.939 --> 26:27.234
- And a three count.
- OK, I got it. I got it. It's OK.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.193
Get 'em, Danny.

26:32.949 --> 26:35.867
He seem nervous to you?

26:36.077 --> 26:39.826
You couldn't pull a pin out of his ass
with a tractor.

26:47.839 --> 26:50.295
[crowd] Oh!

26:52.302 --> 26:56.217
When they lose this long,
they don't know how to win.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.507
Come on, Danny!

27:12.614 --> 27:14.357
[hushed crowd]

27:29.173 --> 27:31.131
Yeah!

27:35.054 --> 27:40.095
[man in crowd] Damn, baby!
That's what I'm talking about! All right.

27:44.856 --> 27:47.773
All right. Just three more pins.

27:47.984 --> 27:49.526
- Yeah. I'll be...
- Danny.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.570
I'll be right back. Then we'll celebrate.

27:57.493 --> 27:58.573
Urgh!

27:58.786 --> 28:00.578
[crowd gasps]

28:01.790 --> 28:03.533
Oh, my God!

28:08.504 --> 28:10.544
[Danny] Aw!

28:23.353 --> 28:25.642
Feeling better?

28:28.692 --> 28:33.318
- I'm going out to get some more liquor.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

28:33.529 --> 28:36.199
Really? I think it's a great idea.

28:36.408 --> 28:41.485
- You're in your underwear!
- So now I can't go out in my underwear?

28:41.705 --> 28:43.497
- Danny...
- What?

28:43.707 --> 28:49.163
Just because I'm a miserable failure,
you think you can tell me what to do?

28:49.379 --> 28:52.666
Let me tell you,
Miss High-Powered Network Big Shot

28:52.883 --> 28:56.716
Don't I Look Hot In My ABC Blazer,
I am still a man!

28:56.929 --> 29:01.721
And if I want to go out in my underwear,
I am going out in my underwear!

29:01.933 --> 29:06.643
If I want to go out with no underwear,
I'm going out with no underwear.

29:06.856 --> 29:08.812
- You got that?
- Go ahead.

29:17.450 --> 29:20.404
OK, I guess we know who's boss, huh?

29:20.619 --> 29:23.656
- You need a doctor.
- Why don't you just say it?

29:23.873 --> 29:27.455
- Say what?
- You know. ''Danny, you blew it.''

29:27.668 --> 29:33.624
''You choked. You had it and you lost it!
You just never had the guts to win!''

29:33.841 --> 29:36.047
- What a shitty thing to say!
- I didn't say it.

29:36.261 --> 29:39.427
- You're thinking it.
- Well, yeah, I'm thinking it!

29:50.233 --> 29:55.191
You hit a car.
You could have killed somebody.

29:55.405 --> 29:57.563
The way I bowl?

30:00.493 --> 30:02.866
You know,

30:03.079 --> 30:06.413
I never regretted a moment until tonight.

30:08.877 --> 30:15.378
All those years of losing...this was
the first time I've felt like a loser.

30:17.678 --> 30:20.085
Come here.

30:20.305 --> 30:21.882
Come on.

30:23.391 --> 30:25.100
OK.

30:35.112 --> 30:38.695
Great. Now I'm impotent.

30:38.908 --> 30:43.036
- We just kissed for two seconds.
- Usually we're showering by now.

30:43.245 --> 30:44.823
[knock]

30:45.039 --> 30:47.078
That's probably the manager.

30:51.295 --> 30:53.122
Who are you?

30:53.338 --> 30:57.336
- Daniel McTeague?
- No shit. That's my name, too.

30:57.551 --> 31:00.754
No. I'm Laura Dinsmore.
I'm a private detective.

31:00.971 --> 31:05.051
You're a detective?
Great. Help me find my pants.

31:13.067 --> 31:15.819
- Mr McTeague.
- Just a minute.

31:16.028 --> 31:20.240
Do you have any where
she's leaning over a saddle looking coy?

31:21.576 --> 31:24.245
Is your father still in Brazil?

31:25.330 --> 31:27.617
- Dad?
- Yeah.

31:28.707 --> 31:31.033
No, that was years ago.

31:31.252 --> 31:37.421
He's been in Ethiopia, Chile, Uruguay.
He was with the Kurds for a while.

31:37.634 --> 31:41.084
Wherever there's injustice,
you can find my dad.

31:41.304 --> 31:47.556
You see, you two have never met him.
He's a great man, but he...

31:49.062 --> 31:53.189
When I was a kid, he gave away
my toys to the poorer kids.

31:53.399 --> 31:56.685
Not just the broken toys,
I mean the good toys.

31:56.903 --> 31:59.774
Then he'd want me to be happy about it.

32:04.745 --> 32:09.205
The family was thinking, if your dad
would try to make up with Joe...

32:09.415 --> 32:12.750
Look, my dad hated these people.

32:12.961 --> 32:17.173
He said they worshipped money
above all things, especially Uncle Joe.

32:17.382 --> 32:19.837
- They're just...
- Why don't you go back?

32:20.051 --> 32:24.761
If you could help, you'd share
in the inheritance, whichever relative got it.

32:24.973 --> 32:28.924
Oh, please.
What, I'm going to become like them?

32:29.145 --> 32:31.683
Kiss up to my uncle and wait for him to die?

32:31.898 --> 32:36.108
No, I'd rather the naked Limey chick
got the money. Sorry.

32:36.318 --> 32:40.067
No. It's nice to meet an honest man.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.523
Especially in your family.

32:47.913 --> 32:50.618
Oh. Sorry about your car.

32:50.833 --> 32:55.874
That's all right, it's a rental.
If you change your mind, give me a call.

32:57.172 --> 32:59.415
- Night.
- Goodnight.

33:05.055 --> 33:08.507
- You coming inside?
- He taught me how to bowl.

33:08.726 --> 33:10.765
Who did?

33:10.978 --> 33:13.303
- Uncle Joe.
- Really?

33:16.358 --> 33:20.142
What do you think, honey?
Should I go back there?

33:20.362 --> 33:25.072
- Well, I mean, if you hate him anyway...
- No, I don't hate him.

33:25.285 --> 33:30.279
No, my dad hated him.
I was just a kid. He was really nice to me.

33:31.749 --> 33:33.872
Well...

33:36.254 --> 33:38.959
Who am I kidding?

33:39.174 --> 33:43.420
I was thinking of going back
to see my uncle because I...

33:43.637 --> 33:47.254
I thought he might loan me money
for that bowling alley.

33:47.473 --> 33:50.178
People borrow money
from relatives all the time.

33:50.393 --> 33:53.429
- But my family...
- You know you're a decent person.

33:53.646 --> 33:58.308
Just decide what you want to do
and don't beat yourself up over it. OK?

33:58.526 --> 34:03.604
Maybe my relatives have changed.
Maybe they're not so ridiculous any more.

34:03.823 --> 34:07.488
# Happy birthday to you

34:07.702 --> 34:11.485
# Happy birthday to you

34:11.956 --> 34:16.915
# Happy birthday, Uncle Joe

34:17.129 --> 34:22.170
# Happy birthday to you #

34:25.762 --> 34:28.004
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Blow 'em out...

34:28.223 --> 34:31.806
Presents! I like presents,
especially from people who love me.

34:32.018 --> 34:33.927
And who would that be?

34:34.146 --> 34:37.266
We've got something very special for you.

34:37.732 --> 34:40.306
- I said cut the crap!
- Come on.

34:40.527 --> 34:44.608
- I can see your panties!
- Stop it. Right now. Come on.

34:44.822 --> 34:46.780
- Get off!
- Cool it!

34:46.992 --> 34:52.069
- Why don't you listen to me? Shithead.
- Stop it. Both of you.

34:52.289 --> 34:55.492
A movie? I haven't liked a movie
since De Mille died.

34:55.710 --> 34:58.711
- You'll like this one.
- Yeah?

34:58.922 --> 35:04.342
- Should the kids leave the room?
- No, no. I'll get the lights.

35:04.552 --> 35:07.304
- Leave it alone!
- Would you stop it?

35:07.513 --> 35:09.590
Come on, guys, sit down.

35:09.807 --> 35:13.757
- See, I told you.
- Shut up!

35:26.116 --> 35:29.614
Tell me more. Tell me
about what's happening in Asia.

35:29.828 --> 35:34.869
Remember this party? You hired
those people to come in and film it?

35:37.460 --> 35:41.920
We shouldn't have advisers there.
We'll get into a full Asian land war.

35:42.132 --> 35:47.838
You're such a beatnik, Daniel.
Sandals and white socks, that's you.

35:48.054 --> 35:50.344
The French, they knew when to get out.

35:50.557 --> 35:53.806
Hitler swapped them a bottle of wine
for their country.

35:54.018 --> 35:57.553
They took it. They...
Why are you filming this?

35:57.772 --> 36:00.346
l'm not paying you to film this. You...

36:00.567 --> 36:02.975
Where's my special boy?

36:03.195 --> 36:06.529
- Where's Uncle Joe's special boy?
- Here l am, Uncle Joe.

36:06.741 --> 36:10.868
Carl, get in touch with reality.
Where's Little Danny?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.410
Where's my special little boy?

36:14.623 --> 36:16.034
l'm right here.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.124
There you are.

36:18.335 --> 36:22.748
Here, film this. This is why l hired you.
You gonna do Durante?

36:22.965 --> 36:26.049
- Yeah.
- Good boy. Come on.

36:30.222 --> 36:35.643
[as Durante] # lnka dinka doo
A dinka dee a dinka doo

36:35.852 --> 36:40.645
# Oh, what a tune for croonin'

36:41.650 --> 36:47.107
# lnka dinka doo a dinka dee a dinka doo

36:47.323 --> 36:51.901
# lt's got the whole world...swoonin'

36:52.995 --> 36:55.913
# Eskimo belles up in...

36:56.123 --> 36:59.124
[ as Durante] Stop the musicl Stop the music.

36:59.335 --> 37:04.625
Folks, l want to welcome you
to my Great-Uncle Joe's 50th birthday party.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.129
Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha

37:07.343 --> 37:09.466
Remember, Uncle Joe...

37:09.679 --> 37:12.633
# Start off each day with a song

37:12.890 --> 37:16.094
# Even when things go wrong

37:16.310 --> 37:19.929
# You'll feel better, you'll even look better

37:20.148 --> 37:23.066
# l'm here to tell you you got to be go-getter

37:23.276 --> 37:25.981
# 'Cause you know that you can't go wrong

37:26.196 --> 37:30.110
# When you start off each day with a song #

37:31.159 --> 37:32.653
- Yeah.
- Yeahl

37:38.166 --> 37:40.075
Good boy.

37:42.170 --> 37:43.747
Uncle Joe,

37:43.963 --> 37:46.087
here's our present.

37:51.972 --> 37:54.888
- Who the hell is this?
- It's Danny.

37:55.099 --> 37:58.516
Danny Junior. We found him for you
for your birthday.

38:00.355 --> 38:05.694
- Danny?
- Uncle Joe. Happy birthday.

38:06.612 --> 38:08.319
Little Danny!

38:09.739 --> 38:11.946
Hug him. Go hug him.

38:12.742 --> 38:14.736
Stop the music, huh?

38:15.913 --> 38:19.033
- Hey!
- Hey.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.664
What a present!

38:24.213 --> 38:27.130
- Is your...?
- What?

38:27.341 --> 38:30.675
- Are you alone?
- Oh, yeah.

38:31.595 --> 38:33.885
Yeah.

38:34.098 --> 38:37.633
Well, let's go break the pinata.

38:38.518 --> 38:42.386
You can do it! Come on, get him!
Hit the pig!

38:43.566 --> 38:46.271
Douglas looks the same as he did
25 years ago.

38:46.486 --> 38:48.228
This is his son.

38:48.446 --> 38:51.897
- Come on, Douglas! You can do it!
- [Uncle Joe] Keep going.

38:56.579 --> 38:59.034
So your cousins brought you here, huh?

38:59.249 --> 39:01.536
Yeah, it was their idea.

39:01.750 --> 39:05.998
I wonder what made them
suddenly decide to do that.

39:09.050 --> 39:11.089
Don't know, huh?

39:11.302 --> 39:14.387
- I couldn't...
- They tell you about Molly?

39:15.723 --> 39:17.881
Yeah.

39:18.100 --> 39:22.810
- Yeah, they did.
- [Molly] Come on, you can do better than that.

39:25.942 --> 39:28.563
She's your new nurse, right?

39:28.777 --> 39:33.571
She's more than a nurse.
She's a...companion.

39:33.783 --> 39:38.826
- What do you think about that?
- Hey. You worked hard. You're entitled.

39:39.039 --> 39:41.909
What do you really think?

39:43.418 --> 39:49.290
I think it's ridiculous. I mean, I'm watching
you, you can barely wear your hat.

39:50.383 --> 39:53.967
Douglas, stop playing around
and fetch me a beer.

39:54.179 --> 39:56.338
My pleasure, sir.

39:57.432 --> 39:59.674
What are you two talking about?

39:59.893 --> 40:05.232
I was telling Danny about Molly.
How important she's become to me.

40:06.233 --> 40:11.275
I've been thinking that she's the person
in the world who's become closest to me.

40:11.488 --> 40:17.325
The person I'd most like to see have
some happiness, some good fortune.

40:20.039 --> 40:25.662
But seeing Little Daniel again
has made me think about...family.

40:25.877 --> 40:31.252
After all is said and done,
maybe family comes first, mm?

40:31.467 --> 40:35.963
Molly! What do you think?
Does family come first?

40:36.180 --> 40:38.932
I suppose it depends on the family, really.

40:39.141 --> 40:40.470
How wise.

40:40.684 --> 40:43.223
How deep, how pithy.

40:45.565 --> 40:49.609
Family, friends...who can choose?

40:52.030 --> 40:54.236
- Know what I'd like?
- [all] What?

40:54.448 --> 40:57.118
I'd like Danny to do Jimmy Durante for me.

40:57.326 --> 41:00.245
- Yes!
- Yeah, come on!

41:00.455 --> 41:03.740
- That would be just so happy-making.
- Yeah.

41:03.958 --> 41:06.579
No.

41:06.794 --> 41:09.796
Jesus! This is pathetic.

41:10.006 --> 41:14.503
- Shut up and do Durante.
- You do Durante! This is demented.

41:14.719 --> 41:20.758
This wasn't such a good present after all.
Molly, honey. Let's go inside.

41:20.976 --> 41:24.095
Your family's here.
They all want to be with you.

41:24.312 --> 41:27.017
But I'd rather just be with you.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.685
All right, then.
First let me get some sweeties.

41:33.030 --> 41:35.521
- Danny, are you married?
- No.

41:35.741 --> 41:39.157
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

41:39.369 --> 41:43.283
Bring her around tomorrow. Two o'clock.
We'll go swimming.

41:43.498 --> 41:45.740
Swimming. Great.

42:02.309 --> 42:04.847
I feel like a goddamn tea bag.

42:08.483 --> 42:10.604
Sorry, sir.

42:16.407 --> 42:19.195
- Let me ask you, Robin.
- Yes, sir.

42:19.410 --> 42:23.407
- Do you ever produce basketball games?
- I will, next season.

42:23.622 --> 42:25.449
You know what I hate?

42:25.665 --> 42:28.536
When the camera's on the stands
on some moron

42:28.753 --> 42:32.453
and his face is painted blue and white,
and I miss a basket.

42:32.674 --> 42:34.583
- So do I.
- Danny. And you?

42:34.801 --> 42:38.419
You going to bowl the rest of your life?
Hit the senior tours?

42:38.637 --> 42:42.682
Actually, I've given up bowling.
I have this injury.

42:42.892 --> 42:45.679
Oh, yeah, it's a rough sport.

42:50.148 --> 42:55.191
I was going to go back to college.
You know, get a teaching degree.

42:55.404 --> 42:58.904
You'll never make
the same money as Robin.

43:01.370 --> 43:06.031
We've decided that that's not important.

43:06.249 --> 43:07.707
Right.

43:09.544 --> 43:11.584
- Douglas!
- Yes, sir?

43:15.550 --> 43:18.171
Much obliged, sir.
May I change now, sir?

43:18.386 --> 43:22.135
- Go dance the hully-gully for all I care.
- Thank you, sir.

43:22.349 --> 43:27.344
Yeah, I know, teaching's
a wondertul thing. Very noble.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.516
Bowling ten years,
that leads to nothing?

43:30.732 --> 43:34.184
- You just throw those ten years away?
- Well, I...

43:41.243 --> 43:43.069
What?

43:43.286 --> 43:48.993
I have this opportunity to invest
in a bowling centre. It's an excellent deal.

43:49.209 --> 43:53.539
- But I'm...
- Short of money.

43:53.756 --> 43:54.871
Yeah.

43:55.090 --> 43:57.795
- How much?
- It's $300,000.

43:59.970 --> 44:04.015
[whistles Durante tune]

44:06.728 --> 44:09.265
Danny, come in the pool.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.892
Ah... Just...

44:22.742 --> 44:24.782
Ph! Pah!

44:25.996 --> 44:28.867
- Is this salt water?
- Yeah. Helps me float.

44:30.043 --> 44:34.539
This belt's not enough.
I can't use my legs.

44:34.756 --> 44:37.757
Tell you what,
I'll wrestIe you for the money.

44:37.967 --> 44:40.339
- What?
- I'll wrestle you.

44:40.553 --> 44:44.847
If you win, I'll give you $300,000.
If I win, you owe me nothing.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.931
[nervous laugh]

44:48.394 --> 44:52.178
Show that girlfriend of yours
what you're made of.

44:52.398 --> 44:55.814
Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna beat up
an elderly crippled man

44:56.027 --> 44:58.483
and she's gonna say, ''What a catch!''

45:00.031 --> 45:02.321
- Can your feet touch?
- No.

45:02.534 --> 45:04.360
Good.

45:04.577 --> 45:07.364
[cries out]

45:08.498 --> 45:11.868
- Danny?
- Come on, bowler!

45:13.086 --> 45:17.499
- Help me! Oh, man!
- Joe-Joe, that's enough. Let him up.

45:25.808 --> 45:27.183
Help!

45:27.392 --> 45:30.808
[Uncle Joe screams then Danny joins in]

45:37.235 --> 45:40.570
- I win the first round. Two out of three.
- No!

45:40.781 --> 45:42.820
You heard him. He quit.

45:48.330 --> 45:49.610
Where is he?

45:49.832 --> 45:52.619
- You OK?
- Get me out, honey.

45:53.836 --> 45:56.671
Jesus! You got the grip of a bear!

45:56.880 --> 45:59.550
40 years of lifting scrap metal.

45:59.758 --> 46:02.795
And I like to win.

46:03.011 --> 46:05.301
Yeah, well.

46:06.974 --> 46:09.466
I'll give you the money.

46:11.228 --> 46:13.304
300,000. It's yours.

46:16.359 --> 46:20.522
- You mean like a loan?
- No, no, no. It's yours. A gift.

46:21.739 --> 46:24.823
You're different from the others.
You're better.

46:25.033 --> 46:28.450
And for all the times you made me laugh.

46:28.663 --> 46:31.450
# lnka dinka dinka dinka dink #

46:31.666 --> 46:34.239
Uncle Joe, this is... I don't...

46:34.460 --> 46:38.292
- Still see your father?
- What? Oh, yeah, sure.

46:38.505 --> 46:42.041
I bail him out of jail, we make a day of it.

46:42.260 --> 46:45.095
- Strange man.
- Well, yeah, strange, sure.

46:45.304 --> 46:48.056
But with principles he believes in.

46:48.266 --> 46:51.053
I want you to call him from here.

46:51.269 --> 46:52.846
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:53.062 --> 46:58.021
That's really great. Because it's been
too many years, and it's silly...

46:58.235 --> 47:02.103
Tell him you came to me for money
and I'm giving it to you.

47:02.322 --> 47:05.073
You realise he was wrong and I was right.

47:05.283 --> 47:08.284
And you need what I've got
more than what he's got.

47:08.494 --> 47:10.737
Tell him and I'll give you the money.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.164
Robin, we're leaving.

47:30.892 --> 47:34.807
You know there's something
sicker about you than your legs?

47:43.780 --> 47:44.781
How about you, Molly?

47:45.302 --> 47:46.947
Wanna wrestle?

47:56.539 --> 47:57.867
Douglas!

47:58.123 --> 48:00.531
[thunder]

48:20.814 --> 48:24.098
- You had us worried.
- About what?

48:24.316 --> 48:28.777
Well, we put Uncle Joe to bed
and we realised how late it was,

48:28.988 --> 48:32.073
and we got concerned about you.

48:32.283 --> 48:36.744
Monday nights l go to this news-stand
to get the new TV Guide for Joe.

48:39.165 --> 48:43.542
He likes to get it early so he can
circle everything he wants to watch.

48:43.752 --> 48:45.995
Does he circle your ass?

48:47.090 --> 48:51.502
You really are a stupid sod, aren't you?
l'm going to bed.

48:53.095 --> 48:57.924
Uncle Joe was sprawled out up there.
You might want to push him to one side.

49:01.563 --> 49:04.729
- You think l'm bonking the old gent.
- Yeah, we do.

49:08.236 --> 49:10.145
Let me tell you, handsome.

49:10.363 --> 49:14.657
lf l were having sex with your Uncle Joe,
he'd be dead by now.

49:14.868 --> 49:17.784
Yeah, that's right. You're just his nurse. Huh!

49:17.996 --> 49:21.116
Yeah, l believe that. Excuse me a second.
Ha-ha-ha!

49:21.332 --> 49:24.250
l'm no more a nurse
than you are a human being.

49:24.461 --> 49:27.628
l'm here because l'm fun.
And l'm fun to look at.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.592
l don't mind, because l like it here.

49:30.800 --> 49:35.926
l like the car, the house, the comfort.
My life hasn't always been comfortable.

49:36.139 --> 49:41.383
Also, l like your Uncle Joe.
He's tough, he's funny and he's nice to me.

49:41.604 --> 49:43.727
But l'm not a whore.

49:43.940 --> 49:48.565
And if he asked me to sleep with him,
l'd leave. Goodnight.

49:50.655 --> 49:55.612
lt took you one day to get rid of Danny.
lmpressive, but that is not our last move!

49:55.826 --> 49:57.617
Move?

49:57.828 --> 50:00.401
You mean Danny's part of you?

50:00.622 --> 50:04.122
- We've been nice.
- But these are the finals, honey.

50:04.335 --> 50:06.576
- We're diving for every ball.
- What?

50:06.795 --> 50:09.916
l didn't like the Beatles and l don't like you.

50:10.133 --> 50:14.212
- You know, you're insane.
- Listen! People have accidents.

50:17.891 --> 50:21.425
- What?
- Frank, what are you saying?

50:21.644 --> 50:24.929
l'm saying people have accidents,
that's all.

51:16.784 --> 51:19.404
- Got you, boss.
- OK.

51:23.457 --> 51:25.283
Here.

51:28.921 --> 51:30.629
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

51:30.839 --> 51:35.050
- You still work here.
- l love this place.

51:36.804 --> 51:38.926
Who wouldn't?

51:40.057 --> 51:42.299
What do you want to see me about?

51:42.518 --> 51:47.013
Short and sweet. l figured you came back
sucking around for money,

51:47.230 --> 51:52.107
that you were like the others.
Maybe you're not.

51:52.319 --> 51:55.486
So l apologise. OK?

51:55.698 --> 51:57.442
Go home now.

51:57.659 --> 52:01.110
God, that was lovely.
l'm getting a little weepy.

52:03.205 --> 52:08.247
You're still a funny kid.
Not as cute as you used to be, though.

52:08.461 --> 52:11.663
Yeah, well, you're no Monet yourself.

52:11.880 --> 52:17.717
Well, l lived in the streets till l was 20.
l was homeless before it was popular.

52:19.013 --> 52:22.964
Can we go inside a second?

52:23.185 --> 52:27.182
l'm sorry that after all these years
l even mentioned money.

52:27.396 --> 52:29.639
l didn't mean to.

52:31.026 --> 52:33.694
Maybe l did. But anyway, l'm sorry l did.

52:33.904 --> 52:36.110
Still want the money?

52:36.322 --> 52:38.943
Jesus, you don't let up.

52:39.159 --> 52:43.488
Look, money's money, OK?
l need it just like everybody else.

52:43.705 --> 52:49.411
But money is not going to turn me into
a sycophantic ass-licking wacko.

52:49.628 --> 52:53.127
l have work to do.
Thanks for coming over.

52:54.882 --> 52:58.418
Before you go,
could you get me a cup of water?

53:00.097 --> 53:01.970
lt's hot in here.

53:02.182 --> 53:04.554
Yeah, OK.

53:12.984 --> 53:17.896
Hello? Long lsland Hauling?
l got a load sitting out here for a week.

53:18.115 --> 53:20.356
Fieldstone 855...

53:22.202 --> 53:24.242
What?

53:24.455 --> 53:30.209
What do you mean, they're out of business
25 years? l call them every day.

53:38.552 --> 53:40.380
Joe?

53:45.600 --> 53:48.768
- Joe?
- 25 years.

53:51.566 --> 53:54.436
Should l go get someone? Are you...?

53:56.362 --> 53:59.315
- l'm going to get someone.
- Danny!

54:02.576 --> 54:06.195
- Stay here.
- Are you all right?

54:08.249 --> 54:11.369
l have gaps. Lapses. l...

54:11.586 --> 54:16.082
- How often?
- More lately. l'm hurting the business.

54:16.299 --> 54:18.872
What? No, l mean, l'm sure...

54:19.093 --> 54:22.926
lf your cousins find out,
they'll take me to court.

54:23.139 --> 54:27.053
They'll declare me incompetent.
They'll pick me clean like buzzards.

54:28.894 --> 54:31.516
They'll put me away.

54:32.607 --> 54:35.359
l have an idea. Lock the door.

54:35.568 --> 54:36.897
Quick!

54:40.573 --> 54:43.444
Get a chair. Come on.

54:45.078 --> 54:48.412
- lt's really my lawyer's idea.
- OK.

54:48.624 --> 54:54.626
He says that l can turn all my affairs,
give everything over to one person now,

54:54.837 --> 54:58.373
before this gets worse, which it will.

54:59.843 --> 55:04.588
Someone l trust who'll take care of me,
who'll take care of the business.

55:05.723 --> 55:07.633
You understand?

55:07.851 --> 55:08.847
Yeah.

55:12.857 --> 55:15.312
l don't want to go into a home.

55:16.610 --> 55:19.065
l wouldn't let that happen.

55:22.073 --> 55:24.031
- You wouldn't?
- No.

55:24.243 --> 55:28.323
You understand? This person
gets control of my money now.

55:28.539 --> 55:32.205
Not when l'm dead. Now. All of it.

55:35.629 --> 55:37.206
Yes.

55:38.465 --> 55:44.089
l'll do it. l'm going to call my lawyers,
set up a meeting for next week.

55:45.431 --> 55:48.847
l'm going to sign these
and turn everything over to Molly.

55:49.059 --> 55:51.266
Right. Because l...

55:52.563 --> 55:54.472
- To Molly?
- Yes.

55:54.690 --> 55:59.566
She's been so kind to me.
Nobody's ever been so kind.

55:59.778 --> 56:04.440
- You're giving everything to Molly?
- Yeah. Who did you think l meant?

56:07.036 --> 56:08.863
You thought l meant you.

56:11.333 --> 56:13.704
No! No.

56:15.044 --> 56:18.496
- But Molly?
- You think it's a mistake.

56:18.715 --> 56:20.257
l don't know, l...

56:20.466 --> 56:23.587
l want to make love to her.

56:24.679 --> 56:27.715
- Joe.
- lf l did this, she...

56:27.932 --> 56:30.424
she'd make love to me. Don't you think?

56:31.937 --> 56:33.728
Joe, look.

56:33.938 --> 56:37.640
A lot of women will do that
for a lot less money.

56:37.859 --> 56:40.266
No. l want her.

56:40.486 --> 56:42.942
This doesn't sound so good to me.

56:43.156 --> 56:46.359
l just don't think that you're being...

56:46.576 --> 56:51.452
l just don't think that you've had time
to think this through.

56:51.665 --> 56:57.370
l'm so tired of thinking, ''Who should
l trust? Who's not just after my money?''

56:57.588 --> 57:02.001
Danny, help me. l'm exhausted. l...

57:03.927 --> 57:06.797
Maybe l should leave all the money to you.

57:10.934 --> 57:13.639
Well, why don't...?

57:13.854 --> 57:17.306
Why don't we talk about this later? OK?

57:17.524 --> 57:18.900
All right.

57:19.109 --> 57:23.570
ln the meantime, l think it would be best
if you just don't do anything.

57:23.781 --> 57:25.358
All right.

57:25.574 --> 57:29.406
l'm so tired.
Get Douglas to take me home.

57:29.620 --> 57:31.946
l'll be right back.

57:46.762 --> 57:49.929
[commentator]
Throws and shoots...and scores!

57:50.557 --> 57:54.223
Gimme the guy in the stands
with the blue and white face.

57:54.437 --> 57:56.845
That's good. Hold it. Take it.

57:57.064 --> 58:02.189
lt was the saddest thing you ever saw.
This tough old guy just shrivelled up.

58:02.403 --> 58:05.986
Dick, get ready to throw to a commercial.
Honey, l'm concentrating.

58:06.199 --> 58:08.571
- Coe scores!
- You missed the basket!

58:08.785 --> 58:11.786
Dick, sign off and go to commercial.

58:11.996 --> 58:13.823
- Music!
- [assistant] We're a minute under.

58:14.040 --> 58:17.908
You missed the basket
for the guy with the painted face.

58:18.128 --> 58:23.419
Wait a minute. Who's directing this,
you or me? Let me check.

58:23.634 --> 58:27.132
That's my ass!
That's my ass in the director's chair!

58:27.345 --> 58:29.503
Shit! l must be the director!

58:30.807 --> 58:35.184
- Stan, we're back in 20.
- No, it's OK. This guy'll do it. Here you go.

58:35.395 --> 58:37.637
Slide right in here, slugger.

58:37.856 --> 58:40.097
Get me a wide shot, then zoom in.

58:40.316 --> 58:42.024
Get outta here!

58:42.234 --> 58:44.560
l'm just getting the hang of this.

58:44.779 --> 58:48.611
- lt was nice meeting you and your ass!
- That's nice.

58:48.825 --> 58:51.612
Give me another shot of the painted face.

58:52.496 --> 58:54.369
What a pinhead.

58:54.581 --> 58:58.199
l have to work with that pinhead,
so l'll meet you at...

58:58.418 --> 59:02.915
l just wanted to tell you that
l'm moving in with Uncle Joe for a while.

59:03.132 --> 59:04.163
Really?

59:04.383 --> 59:08.843
Honey, l gotta keep an eye on him.
He's not all there.

59:09.054 --> 59:12.423
He's thinking of giving
that naked pizza girl $20 million.

59:12.641 --> 59:14.764
Yeah, that does seem wrong.

59:14.977 --> 59:18.809
But who should get it? Your cousins?
God, what a crew. Klingons.

59:19.023 --> 59:22.107
Well, he sort of mentioned that he might...

59:22.317 --> 59:26.814
- What?
- That he might give it to me.

59:28.491 --> 59:32.620
l'm not taking it that seriously.
That's not why l'm going over there.

59:32.829 --> 59:35.366
l'm just... l'm worried about him.

59:38.501 --> 59:42.914
Still, it's a funny idea, isn't it?

59:44.257 --> 59:47.791
You, me. Married.

59:48.886 --> 59:51.459
Living in that big house.

59:51.681 --> 59:53.804
Yeah, it's funny.

[# Steve Wood:
Money Slips Through My Fingers]

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.604
Don't forget, you owe me a dollar
for the shoes.

01:00:08.156 --> 01:00:11.988
Anyway, as l was saying,

01:00:12.202 --> 01:00:16.033
my lawyer says l can turn
all my money, everything,

01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:19.414
over to one person. Now.

01:00:19.626 --> 01:00:22.496
- You understand?
- Yes.

01:00:22.712 --> 01:00:26.129
- l don't want to end up in a home.
- You won't.

01:00:28.468 --> 01:00:31.967
l'm gonna do it.
l'll set up a meeting for next week

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.048
and l'm gonna turn
everything over to Danny.

01:00:40.479 --> 01:00:42.188
Danny?

01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:45.151
lt was his idea. Who did you think l...?

01:00:47.738 --> 01:00:50.692
You thought l meant you.

01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:55.403
- No. No, l just...
- Molly, what would people say?

01:00:55.621 --> 01:00:57.779
How would it look?

01:00:57.998 --> 01:01:02.625
What do you really know about this bloke?
You haven't seen him in 25 years.

01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:06.252
He shows up here
wanting money for a bowling alley.

01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:09.798
l don't know. l don't know who to trust.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:14.178
Maybe l should leave all my money to you.

01:01:23.565 --> 01:01:24.894
Joe-Joe.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.695
Yes!

01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:33.856
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:39.619
Excuse me. You have a call
from Washington DC, sir.

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:42.703
l'll take it upstairs.

01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:47.744
You stay here with Danny.
Talk. Enjoy yourself.

01:01:48.465 --> 01:01:50.589
Let's go, Douglas.

01:01:54.347 --> 01:01:57.265
You're working for your cousins,
aren't you?

01:01:59.936 --> 01:02:01.762
Wait a minute. How? Who?

01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:06.642
They let it slip out the other night
before they threatened to kill me.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.149
They did what?

01:02:11.406 --> 01:02:14.407
Tell your cousins l'm not afraid of them.

01:02:15.827 --> 01:02:18.152
And you leave Joe alone.

01:02:19.247 --> 01:02:22.617
You keep your breasts off his eyebrows.

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:28.043
- Hey, you little...
- Get off!

01:02:28.256 --> 01:02:31.091
- Come on!
- Mommy!

01:02:35.764 --> 01:02:37.472
lt's good.

01:02:37.683 --> 01:02:42.723
What's happening, Wonder Boy?
l mean, look at this.

01:02:45.148 --> 01:02:48.268
Her tongue is practically in his wallet.

01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:52.151
What are you drinking?

01:02:52.364 --> 01:02:56.576
lt's a 7-Up. l'm not much of a drinker.

01:02:56.785 --> 01:02:58.410
You will be.

01:02:59.245 --> 01:03:02.366
There's something l wanted to ask you.

01:03:03.709 --> 01:03:06.379
- Did you go and see Molly and...?
- No.

01:03:06.587 --> 01:03:09.540
Let me finish. All right?

01:03:09.756 --> 01:03:14.715
Did you go and see Molly
and threaten to kill her?

01:03:16.389 --> 01:03:21.383
What? You see how evil she is?
You see what we're dealing with?

01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:27.806
Why, we... We went to her to ask her
if Joe's taking his medication.

01:03:28.026 --> 01:03:30.433
You know, for his...circulation.

01:03:30.654 --> 01:03:35.445
She said, ''That's for me to know
and for you to worry about.''

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:36.903
She said that?

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:42.243
Then l said, ''l could kill you for that.''
OK, now you know the truth.

01:03:42.456 --> 01:03:47.203
God. First couple of days l was here,
she seemed so nice.

01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:49.993
That's before she saw you as a threat.

01:03:50.214 --> 01:03:53.833
We should have him declared incompetent.
Throw him in a home.

01:03:54.052 --> 01:03:58.180
- A home?
- You know, for his own protection.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:03.134
l hear things at the scrapyard.
There is something wrong with him.

01:04:03.353 --> 01:04:07.896
He screws things up, makes crazy deals.
He forgets deals he's made.

01:04:08.108 --> 01:04:14.313
Have you noticed anything
we could use to put the old man away?

01:04:16.157 --> 01:04:18.114
No.

01:04:18.326 --> 01:04:24.614
Keep your eyes open. And do something!
That's what you're here for.

01:04:26.377 --> 01:04:28.831
Joe? Joe!

01:04:29.046 --> 01:04:30.837
Joe.

01:04:31.047 --> 01:04:33.455
Here, have some water.

01:04:35.343 --> 01:04:37.882
Cough it up.

01:04:38.096 --> 01:04:41.014
Joe, drink some water!

01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:44.060
[Molly] Joe.

01:04:48.774 --> 01:04:50.814
That's it.

01:04:54.113 --> 01:04:56.104
Piece of fruit.

01:04:56.323 --> 01:05:01.151
She tried to kill him. She knows he has
a narrow gullet. All the McTeagues do!

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.157
Shut up.
She's the only one who helped me.

01:05:04.374 --> 01:05:07.956
l tried to help you, Uncle Joe,
but Carl stopped me!

01:05:08.169 --> 01:05:11.289
- Liar!
- Happy birthday, Uncle Joe!

01:05:14.008 --> 01:05:16.131
That was last week.

01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:19.504
You people are...

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:24.265
Come on, Molly. l've lost my appetite.

01:05:29.982 --> 01:05:32.984
l've made a decision.

01:05:42.454 --> 01:05:44.944
Here l am, Uncle Joe.

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:21.773
Everybody wants to get into the act!

01:06:21.994 --> 01:06:23.867
Remember, Uncle Joe...

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.662
# You gotta start off each day with a song

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:30.792
# Even when things go wrong

01:06:31.002 --> 01:06:33.789
# You'll feel better, you'll even look better

01:06:34.005 --> 01:06:36.627
# I'm here to tell you that you'll be a go-getter

01:06:36.842 --> 01:06:38.882
# 'Cause you know
That things can't go wrong

01:06:39.094 --> 01:06:42.178
# When you start off each day with a song...

01:06:42.556 --> 01:06:45.047
Just those in wheelchairs!

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:48.102
[both] # Cause you know
That things can't go wrong

01:06:48.312 --> 01:06:50.351
# When you start off each day with a song

01:06:50.565 --> 01:06:51.940
Big finish!

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:58.686
# When you start off each day with a song... #

01:06:59.198 --> 01:07:01.273
Ha-cha-cha-cha!

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.743
You're something.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:14.080
Robin. Hey. Where you going?

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:17.048
l'm just a little ''lnka-dinka-do'd'' out.

01:07:18.926 --> 01:07:21.500
What, do you think l enjoyed that?

01:07:21.722 --> 01:07:24.675
A week ago, you said it was pathetic.

01:07:24.891 --> 01:07:28.425
Now you're singing, dancing
and sliding down a banister?

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:32.594
Honey, she's a vixen.
She's not giving him his medicine,

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:36.979
she's gonna get his money
and dump him in a home. l know this.

01:07:37.195 --> 01:07:39.484
So it's not the money, it's your uncle.

01:07:39.697 --> 01:07:44.324
Exactly. He's opened up his heart to me,
you know.

01:07:44.535 --> 01:07:49.080
We've rekindled something
that we haven't had since l was a kid.

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:53.039
l mean, we got a bond growing here.

01:07:53.253 --> 01:07:56.835
Danny, l love you and l believe in you.

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:03.004
But isn't everything you're telling me
a big crock of bubbling shit?

01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:05.759
- No.
- lt's just the money.

01:08:05.974 --> 01:08:09.758
- lt's not.
- Mr Daniel.

01:08:09.978 --> 01:08:13.312
Your uncle has requested another chorus.

01:08:13.524 --> 01:08:17.520
- Come with me. Just leave.
- All my stuff's here.

01:08:17.736 --> 01:08:21.069
- All my clothes.
- l've seen your clothes. Just leave.

01:08:21.281 --> 01:08:24.198
Shall l tell him you're coming, sir?

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:29.535
lt's not the money.

01:08:40.384 --> 01:08:43.917
[Danny as Durante]
He's back! Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

01:08:54.857 --> 01:08:59.151
- More wine, sir?
- No, thank you, Douglas.

01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:03.027
- ls the chicken Kiev satisfactory?
- lt's excellent.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.737
Could you tell the cook that tomorrow
l'd like to have broiled salmon again?

01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:12.532
- Very good, sir.
- ls my uncle going to swim today?

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:16.250
He's not at home, sir.
He took the shuttle to Washington.

01:09:16.462 --> 01:09:20.330
- Business trip.
- Yes and no, sir.

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:23.835
- What does that mean?
- He took Miss Molly along.

01:09:25.638 --> 01:09:26.966
He did?

01:09:27.182 --> 01:09:30.799
Yes. He had me book
the honeymoon suite at the Coolidge Hotel.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.600
Honeymoon?

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:37.229
More wine, sir?

01:09:44.825 --> 01:09:49.617
This is a matter of life or death.
These are Mr McTeague's pills.

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:55.785
l have to get them to him in two minutes
and 45 seconds. l need the room number!

01:09:56.002 --> 01:09:58.920
l'm sorry, sir.
Mr McTeague was very specific.

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:02.335
No one is to have his room number.

01:10:02.551 --> 01:10:05.800
- l'll see to it that he gets the pills and...
- No!

01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:10.681
No! No, you don't understand.

01:10:10.893 --> 01:10:17.144
These pills only work if l give them to him
myself. lt's a very rare condition.

01:10:17.357 --> 01:10:21.818
Excuse me, sir.
Does this say ''moron''?

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:28.613
l will leave him your message.
Would you like a room?

01:10:28.828 --> 01:10:30.570
l'm his nephew.

01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:34.536
- Oh, his nephew.
- Yes.

01:10:34.749 --> 01:10:41.038
Because he gave specific instructions
not to give his room number to relatives.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.843
What's the matter with you? Do you
not care about this hotel's reputation?

01:10:49.056 --> 01:10:52.841
There is an old man shacked up here
with a very young girl.

01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:58.434
Sir, most of these rooms have old men
with young girls. This is Washington.

01:10:59.942 --> 01:11:03.987
All right, listen, pal. Just give me...

01:11:06.991 --> 01:11:09.945
..a room. A cheap one.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.200
Of course.

01:11:23.967 --> 01:11:26.588
[Uncle Joe] Come on, Molly. Drink up.

01:11:40.859 --> 01:11:42.187
[knocking]

01:11:42.402 --> 01:11:44.858
Yeah, come in. lt's open.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.567
Right there.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.280
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

01:11:57.167 --> 01:12:00.251
- Where's Molly?
- She's taking a walk.

01:12:01.797 --> 01:12:04.168
We had a fight.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.422
Nothing serious, l hope.

01:12:08.636 --> 01:12:12.469
Be honest. Do you think Molly
would even like me if l wasn't rich?

01:12:12.682 --> 01:12:16.301
Look, l don't want to say
anything against her.

01:12:17.604 --> 01:12:19.763
But like you say, let's be honest.

01:12:20.232 --> 01:12:23.435
How many girls like that
are with poor old guys?

01:12:23.653 --> 01:12:26.607
- Take some towels.
- What?

01:12:26.822 --> 01:12:30.108
For what they charge,
you should take everything.

01:12:30.326 --> 01:12:34.620
l'm trying to figure out a way
to get the bed out of here.

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:38.246
You are some piece of work,
do you know that?

01:12:40.086 --> 01:12:42.623
She's a good kid.

01:12:44.256 --> 01:12:47.423
That's why she can't...

01:12:47.635 --> 01:12:51.680
She can't...
can't just get herself to... You know.

01:12:53.725 --> 01:12:57.804
You mean you two didn't...?

01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:01.477
No.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:07.611
You know, l never believed
that anyone could love me for me.

01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:13.322
How could l,
when my own mother didn't?

01:13:15.037 --> 01:13:16.781
She didn't?

01:13:16.998 --> 01:13:19.952
She left me and my brother at a...

01:13:23.506 --> 01:13:26.956
..at a home in Albany when l was three.

01:13:27.175 --> 01:13:31.089
No note, no nothing.
Never asked about us.

01:13:31.304 --> 01:13:33.760
Never said, ''l'm sorry.''

01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:41.179
Your mother has to love you.

01:13:42.273 --> 01:13:43.471
Right?

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:48.983
So even if no one else does,
she has to, doesn't she?

01:13:51.741 --> 01:13:55.193
Well, if my own mother
couldn't love me, l...

01:14:03.129 --> 01:14:05.001
I...

01:14:08.216 --> 01:14:10.838
l love you, Uncle Joe.

01:14:14.223 --> 01:14:16.050
You do?

01:14:17.476 --> 01:14:19.718
Yeah, l do.

01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:25.599
Take me home, Danny.

01:14:29.614 --> 01:14:32.483
[Robin] He's throwing her out of the house?

01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:35.736
Honey, just wait a second, will you?

01:14:39.123 --> 01:14:42.706
- Danny!
- Honey, l had no choice.

01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:46.916
She wasn't going to bring him back
till she got what she wanted.

01:14:47.131 --> 01:14:49.669
You mean until she got what you wanted.

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:52.173
Honey, it's not like that.

01:14:53.263 --> 01:14:57.971
Look, Uncle Joe and l, we talked.
l mean, we really talked.

01:14:58.183 --> 01:15:01.683
He's been in Washington.
Some military contract.

01:15:01.896 --> 01:15:07.318
- Oh, yeah?
- We're going to go and see his attorneys.

01:15:07.527 --> 01:15:10.979
From now on, honey,
l'm going to be responsible for him.

01:15:11.197 --> 01:15:15.491
l'm gonna be here with him,
and...you know.

01:15:18.663 --> 01:15:20.703
Rich.

01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:25.992
- What about the deal with your cousins?
- My cousins are animals!

01:15:26.212 --> 01:15:29.130
They would put him in a home
if they could.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.583
l'll take care of their children,

01:15:31.802 --> 01:15:35.253
you know, give each kid
like a scholarship or something,

01:15:35.473 --> 01:15:37.927
but my cousins don't deserve anything.

01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:41.308
- You bastard!
- Frank, no!

01:15:41.519 --> 01:15:44.805
- Whatever happened to ''Hello''?
- We heard every word.

01:15:45.024 --> 01:15:47.479
- Did you listen at my door?
- Always.

01:15:47.693 --> 01:15:51.939
- l had no idea how sick you guys were.
- Come spend a day with us.

01:15:52.155 --> 01:15:55.073
- l'd rather shove this up my ass.
- l'll do it.

01:15:55.283 --> 01:16:01.572
- You're playing a lone hand, huh?
- l never agreed to anything with you.

01:16:02.499 --> 01:16:05.666
l only said l'd see
how things were with my uncle.

01:16:05.877 --> 01:16:08.499
l saw, and it made me sick.

01:16:08.714 --> 01:16:14.384
- You bastard.
- l like it better from her. lt's the accent.

01:16:14.595 --> 01:16:17.881
- l thought l'd find you together.
- We're not together.

01:16:18.098 --> 01:16:20.137
Right.

01:16:21.727 --> 01:16:25.226
Do you know, l thought
you were different than the others.

01:16:25.439 --> 01:16:27.765
But you're exactly the same.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:31.815
l am looking out for my uncle, OK?
For his welfare.

01:16:32.029 --> 01:16:35.113
Bullshit. They were willing
to wait until he died.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.482
But you're going to eat him raw.

01:16:37.701 --> 01:16:41.699
- Wait. Danny is not like that.
- Try to remember something, OK?

01:16:41.914 --> 01:16:44.370
ln the long run, nobody likes a tease.

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:48.795
You are a cheap,
chiselling, low-life hustler.

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:52.539
- [Carl] You said it!
- Well, it takes one to spot one.

01:16:58.431 --> 01:17:00.258
- Stop it!
- Great!

01:17:00.474 --> 01:17:04.555
Now you stop it,
after she gets in a shot.

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:10.938
l'll give you half a million dollars to leave.
Cash. Soon as l get the money.

01:17:11.153 --> 01:17:14.069
Better than delivering pizza,
even in a good year.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.406
She gets that and we get a couple
of lousy scholarships? That's not fair!

01:17:19.619 --> 01:17:23.569
No, l will give you half a million dollars
and you leave.

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:26.957
You'll give me half a million?
l'm getting it all!

01:17:27.168 --> 01:17:30.952
He sees right through you.
You're a walking fish-tank, baby.

01:17:31.173 --> 01:17:35.041
- You and your tan tushy can...
- l'll sleep with him.

01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:38.674
What?

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:44.014
- What, you're...you're gonna...?
- As soon as he gets back from work.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.897
l'll give him a right good one.

01:17:48.107 --> 01:17:50.349
You... See, it wouldn't...

01:17:50.568 --> 01:17:54.435
He wouldn't be interested in that.
lt wouldn't even matter.

01:17:54.655 --> 01:17:58.439
lt'll matter. l'll make it matter.

01:18:07.042 --> 01:18:08.915
# Inka dinka doo #

01:18:11.338 --> 01:18:13.331
Molly.

01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:17.250
Do you know that both of my daughters
are named Molly?

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.675
Oh, God.

01:18:19.888 --> 01:18:21.928
Oh, God.

01:18:26.103 --> 01:18:29.852
Oh, God. You think she'll do it?

01:18:31.109 --> 01:18:32.353
Yes, l do.

01:18:32.568 --> 01:18:36.483
You've given her no choice.
She'll do it just to beat you.

01:18:36.697 --> 01:18:40.648
Oh, Jesus. You think it'll work?

01:18:42.287 --> 01:18:44.743
A young girl with a body like that?

01:18:44.956 --> 01:18:49.333
There'll be nothing left of him
but a smile and an old hat.

01:19:03.099 --> 01:19:05.673
Welcome home, Joe.

01:19:10.399 --> 01:19:12.437
Hello, Molly.

01:19:16.654 --> 01:19:18.694
[inaudible]

01:19:19.449 --> 01:19:22.236
l'm tired. l'm going upstairs.

01:19:24.163 --> 01:19:25.158
Uncle Joe!

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.456
Wait!

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:34.375
Sir, will you need my assistance?

01:19:34.589 --> 01:19:37.959
No, Molly will assist me.

01:19:39.219 --> 01:19:41.841
Oh, l see. Very good, sir.

01:19:43.057 --> 01:19:45.345
Let's go.

01:19:49.939 --> 01:19:54.066
Sir? May l ask for a reference
before you go upstairs?

01:19:54.276 --> 01:19:56.352
Not now, Douglas.

01:20:00.449 --> 01:20:03.236
Goodbye, sir.

01:20:03.453 --> 01:20:06.406
Uncle Joe, wait! Please wait.

01:20:06.622 --> 01:20:10.999
- l have a surprise for you.
- Danny, don't.

01:20:13.838 --> 01:20:14.917
Up we go.

01:20:18.343 --> 01:20:21.012
His face! Did you see it?

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.091
l've never been in one of these before.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.642
[Uncle Joe] Hang on!

01:20:33.608 --> 01:20:35.849
Molly, let me say something.

01:20:36.069 --> 01:20:39.852
No. Don't say anything.

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:45.613
- A little young for you, ain't she, Joe?
- Who's there?

01:20:49.916 --> 01:20:52.074
Hi, Joe. lt's been a long time.

01:20:53.086 --> 01:20:57.214
- lt's Daniel.
- Daniel?

01:21:01.135 --> 01:21:07.257
- What are you...? You got so old.
- You're no Monet yourself.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.435
Molly, this is my cousin Daniel.
Danny's father.

01:21:15.066 --> 01:21:18.601
Danny asked me to come.
He's got a real regard for you.

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:24.242
He made me think that maybe things
are different than the way l remember them.

01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.034
But they're not, are they?
lt's still the same.

01:21:28.246 --> 01:21:32.742
God, this place still stinks from greed.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:35.332
Those who have it...

01:21:36.505 --> 01:21:38.712
and those who want it.

01:21:46.181 --> 01:21:47.675
Dad!

01:21:48.976 --> 01:21:54.053
- Hello, Daniel.
- You came! That was great of you.

01:21:55.065 --> 01:21:57.390
- l'm leaving.
- What?

01:21:57.610 --> 01:22:00.611
God. They're all still here.

01:22:00.821 --> 01:22:05.698
First your parents, now you. He'll outlive
your children and leave them nothing.

01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:07.487
You wanna lighten up?

01:22:07.703 --> 01:22:12.032
You know who ruins this world?
The greedy. That's it.

01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:17.083
They have it. l want it.
l have it. l want more.

01:22:17.297 --> 01:22:20.630
That's the real pollution. Greed.

01:22:23.177 --> 01:22:25.585
You know who l think ruins the world?

01:22:25.805 --> 01:22:31.262
Pompous, self-righteous, holier-than-thou
middle-aged fanatics in pony-tails

01:22:31.477 --> 01:22:34.395
who give away their kids' toys!

01:22:36.774 --> 01:22:40.393
- He's got you too, huh?
- No, he doesn't have me.

01:22:40.612 --> 01:22:43.946
- Can't the truth be in between?
- No!

01:22:44.157 --> 01:22:46.944
One way is all right,
one way is all wrong.

01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:49.532
His way or my way. Pick.

01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:51.121
- Dad.
- Pick!

01:22:56.378 --> 01:22:58.704
- You are just so...
- Pick!

01:23:02.175 --> 01:23:04.962
All right, then l pick him.

01:23:07.514 --> 01:23:11.464
At least he doesn't take himself
so goddamn seriously.

01:23:42.508 --> 01:23:44.465
l'm leaving.

01:23:46.345 --> 01:23:48.338
Why?

01:23:49.474 --> 01:23:54.716
l can't believe l was almost
going to screw the old boy for money.

01:23:55.938 --> 01:23:59.521
l suppose maybe l've always
been here for the money.

01:23:59.733 --> 01:24:02.604
Christ, l make myself sick.

01:24:02.821 --> 01:24:05.145
l have to get out of here.

01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:07.942
l understand.

01:24:09.619 --> 01:24:12.738
You'll take care of him, won't you?

01:24:13.498 --> 01:24:15.241
Of course.

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:19.326
You're not going to put him in a home?

01:24:19.546 --> 01:24:20.624
Never.

01:24:24.258 --> 01:24:26.168
Bye.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.146
Hey. You OK?

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:44.942
Yeah.

01:24:46.157 --> 01:24:50.782
God, that was some scene
with your father. l just...

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:55.032
What?

01:24:57.042 --> 01:24:58.786
That wasn't my father.

01:25:01.045 --> 01:25:03.583
What?

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:08.377
That was an actor.
My father wouldn't come here on a bet.

01:25:11.015 --> 01:25:13.968
- So you just...?
- lt was my only shot, honey.

01:25:14.184 --> 01:25:17.802
He wanted me to pick him over my father.

01:25:18.021 --> 01:25:20.691
Yes, and you said you never would.

01:25:20.899 --> 01:25:24.732
l didn't. l picked him over an actor.

01:25:27.073 --> 01:25:29.479
- Don't touch me.
- What?

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.784
- Hey. Come on. What's the matter?
- Danny.

01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:36.162
You dropped your compass in the woods
and you're lost.

01:25:36.373 --> 01:25:37.999
l'm not lost.

01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:42.586
- You don't see how sick this is?
- No!

01:25:42.796 --> 01:25:47.874
- Who got hurt?
- The truth got hurt. OK?

01:25:48.094 --> 01:25:52.092
lntegrity, self-respect,
decent human behaviour got hurt.

01:25:52.306 --> 01:25:56.434
l will be good to him.
Tell me who else will be as good.

01:25:56.643 --> 01:26:00.179
- That's not the point.
- No, that is the point.

01:26:01.399 --> 01:26:05.895
We've been through a lot together
and l think l've been pretty loyal.

01:26:06.112 --> 01:26:08.602
Honey, you've been great.

01:26:08.822 --> 01:26:13.818
But if you touch one cent
of your uncle's money, we're through.

01:26:15.413 --> 01:26:17.786
- What are you, crazy?
- l mean it.

01:26:17.999 --> 01:26:22.660
lf you take any of that money,
l will have no respect for you.

01:26:22.879 --> 01:26:26.461
Jesus! You sound like my father.

01:26:26.674 --> 01:26:31.384
No, l sound like the actor
who played your father. Enjoy your money.

01:26:38.019 --> 01:26:40.344
- Daniel McTeague Junior.
- Here.

01:26:44.777 --> 01:26:48.644
Your great-uncle has chosen,
for reasons l assume he's explained,

01:26:48.863 --> 01:26:51.021
to transfer to you all his assets,

01:26:51.241 --> 01:26:56.484
including full control of his commercial,
personal and financial affairs.

01:26:56.706 --> 01:26:59.576
My boy. My good boy.

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:05.834
l would like to give you a full picture
of your great-uncle's holdings.

01:27:06.047 --> 01:27:10.378
The McTeague Scrap Metal Company,
comprising scrapyards, trucking...

01:27:10.594 --> 01:27:12.219
Excuse me.

01:27:14.223 --> 01:27:18.517
Uncle Joe, there's something
l'd like to explain to you.

01:27:20.479 --> 01:27:24.477
First of all, when l came
to your birthday party that time,

01:27:24.692 --> 01:27:30.030
l had no idea this was going to happen.
l wasn't after your money.

01:27:30.238 --> 01:27:34.189
l know that. That's why l love you.

01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:42.660
Joe. l have to tell you something.

01:27:42.876 --> 01:27:44.251
What?

01:27:46.172 --> 01:27:47.714
l'm...

01:27:49.258 --> 01:27:52.212
going to take such good care of you.

01:27:54.306 --> 01:27:56.594
You're a good boy.

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:00.009
ls that it?

01:28:00.937 --> 01:28:03.475
- Yeah.
- Well, that was lovely.

01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:08.519
As l was saying, the McTeague
Scrap Metal Company, comprising...

01:28:08.735 --> 01:28:13.482
- Stop! Sign nothing!
- What the hell is this?

01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:16.736
Oh, my, my, my.

01:28:16.954 --> 01:28:19.409
lf deceit has a name, it's his name!

01:28:25.253 --> 01:28:30.794
Daniel, is it true? ls everything
these gerbils have been telling me true?

01:28:34.846 --> 01:28:36.885
Dad.

01:28:37.098 --> 01:28:38.094
Dad?

01:28:38.308 --> 01:28:41.891
Yes, Dad. Daniel McTeague Senior, his father.

01:28:42.104 --> 01:28:47.099
His real father, not the actor he hired
to come to your house last night.

01:28:48.194 --> 01:28:50.020
Danny.

01:28:52.989 --> 01:28:55.563
They told me that, Daniel.

01:28:58.329 --> 01:29:00.286
ls it true?

01:29:02.082 --> 01:29:04.538
Yeah. lt's true.

01:29:06.837 --> 01:29:13.374
You hired an actor to pretend he was me,
and then pretended to fight with him?

01:29:13.594 --> 01:29:17.342
And told him
you preferred Uncle Joe to me?

01:29:17.556 --> 01:29:21.340
Well, when you put it like that,
it sounds kind of bad.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:26.389
l know we've had our differences.
And l know you think l'm strange.

01:29:26.608 --> 01:29:28.564
No. No, Dad.

01:29:28.775 --> 01:29:32.608
l am. But l've always respected you,
Daniel. Always.

01:29:32.821 --> 01:29:35.739
l've always felt you had real character.

01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:37.195
Ha-ha!

01:29:40.121 --> 01:29:42.825
- Does money mean this much to you?
- No.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.124
l didn't go and see Uncle Joe
for the money.

01:29:46.335 --> 01:29:51.875
We made a deal. lf he kept the money
in the family, he'd get a cut. Right?

01:29:52.091 --> 01:29:54.629
- Yes, but...
- Then he double-crossed us.

01:29:54.845 --> 01:29:57.928
Because they're scum! They're greedy!

01:29:58.139 --> 01:30:01.639
We're greedy? We were willing to share.

01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:04.389
Dad.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.900
l don't know what happened.
l just got...sucked in.

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:15.322
First one thing didn't seem wrong,
then another, until...

01:30:15.532 --> 01:30:17.940
Nothing seemed wrong.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.077
l know. That's why l left.

01:30:35.302 --> 01:30:39.346
- How are you, Joe?
- l'm still eating grapes.

01:31:02.871 --> 01:31:05.956
- Uncle Joe.
- Save it.

01:31:07.418 --> 01:31:12.792
OK, Joe. Bare knuckles, toe to toe.
We've spent 20 years eating your shit

01:31:13.007 --> 01:31:17.086
and saying, ''Mm! What a cook.''
No more. We've hired attorneys.

01:31:17.302 --> 01:31:20.968
lf we don't get our share,
we'll get you declared incompetent.

01:31:21.182 --> 01:31:23.803
And we'll win,
because we found out things.

01:31:24.018 --> 01:31:27.102
You've got toys in the attic. Broken toys.

01:31:27.814 --> 01:31:31.977
And we'll hammer on you
until you cave in. Understand?

01:31:32.192 --> 01:31:35.442
- Or is your mind already gone?
- All right!

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.369
Sit down. All of you.

01:31:42.495 --> 01:31:44.321
- Uncle Joe...
- Quiet.

01:31:55.092 --> 01:31:57.083
Go ahead.

01:31:57.302 --> 01:32:00.468
As l was saying
before the circus came to town,

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.839
your uncle's holdings at their peak

01:32:03.058 --> 01:32:08.349
held a net - net, mind you -
financial value of just under $25 million.

01:32:12.275 --> 01:32:16.225
At the moment, however,
he is $95,000 in debt.

01:32:25.621 --> 01:32:30.201
- Wait a minute. He's...?
- ln debt beyond the value of his assets.

01:32:35.257 --> 01:32:38.127
The room, is it doing this?

01:32:40.095 --> 01:32:43.345
l fear this has come as a shock to you.

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:48.897
No. Shitting a sailboat, that's a shock.
This is a fucking catastrophe!

01:32:49.813 --> 01:32:53.313
The trip to Washington
was not for a military contract.

01:32:53.525 --> 01:32:58.353
lt was to work out an arrangement
with the lRS to keep Joe out of jail.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:02.866
That has been accomplished,
but everything is lost.

01:33:03.076 --> 01:33:07.240
Plus some arrangement
must be made for the 95,000.

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:15.037
How the hell do you lose $25 million?

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:17.756
lt's easier than you think.

01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:22.675
l overextended, made loans,
some claims the government wouldn't allow.

01:33:22.889 --> 01:33:26.554
- The penalties were...
- Hold it. l don't believe this.

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:29.602
lt's another one of his tricks.
A little test!

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:32.434
l will put you in touch with the lRS.

01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:37.145
They'll give you a full accounting
and a brochure for the auction.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:41.573
- Auction?
- They're taking my home.

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:44.737
Damn it! Stupid, stupid!

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:49.200
We played along!
We should've stepped in five years ago!

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:51.492
Two would have been enough.

01:33:51.710 --> 01:33:54.545
You stupid, pathetic old man.

01:33:54.755 --> 01:33:57.375
Goddamn it! One more word out of you,

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:01.919
l'll kick your ass so high up
you'll take off your shirt to shit!

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.046
Come on.

01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:06.637
Come on, bowling boy!

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:12.184
Stop it!

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:14.436
Frank, cut it out!

01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:24.401
- Stop! l've got a metal plate in my head.
- You do?

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.409
No!

01:34:28.037 --> 01:34:32.036
- That's enough.
- Get security to the conference room.

01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:35.252
That's enough. Get over here.

01:34:36.422 --> 01:34:38.330
Meathead!

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:41.086
You're insane, you know that?

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:45.299
Me? For five years, l begged you,
let's put him in a home!

01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:50.756
No, you didn't want to. You didn't have
the balls! None of you have any balls!

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.551
Frank?

01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:56.524
l've been waiting to do this a long time.

01:35:03.532 --> 01:35:04.943
Stop it.

01:35:05.159 --> 01:35:06.819
Come on.

01:35:07.036 --> 01:35:10.322
- l want them out of here!
- lt's all right!

01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:17.453
We were...

01:35:17.671 --> 01:35:20.293
We were just leaving, anyway.

01:35:21.175 --> 01:35:23.796
- What do we do now?
- Nothing!

01:35:24.012 --> 01:35:27.381
We wait around and dance at his funeral.

01:35:50.997 --> 01:35:53.120
You're still here.

01:35:55.085 --> 01:35:58.916
How long have you known you were broke?

01:35:59.130 --> 01:36:01.668
About a year.

01:36:01.883 --> 01:36:03.508
A year.

01:36:03.719 --> 01:36:10.255
So this whole time you were...what?
Schmucking with me? Every second.

01:36:10.475 --> 01:36:13.642
Danny, please, l had to find out,

01:36:13.853 --> 01:36:17.554
to know who'd care for me
when they knew l had nothing.

01:36:17.774 --> 01:36:22.935
And care will be required.
Your uncle's condition is degenerative,

01:36:23.155 --> 01:36:27.152
and whoever assumes control
over his finances

01:36:27.367 --> 01:36:29.823
must oversee the liquidation of his assets,

01:36:30.037 --> 01:36:32.742
be responsible
for the outstanding balance,

01:36:32.956 --> 01:36:35.412
and, of course, there's our bill.

01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:38.412
We will need you to sign these papers.

01:36:38.628 --> 01:36:41.036
lf you'd just told me the truth.

01:36:43.592 --> 01:36:47.507
l mean, l'm not saying
l'm a perfect guy or anything,

01:36:47.722 --> 01:36:53.344
but then maybe l could have felt
some compassion, some responsibility.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.802
Just the truth!

01:36:57.481 --> 01:37:01.693
The truth is, l'm an old guy.
l'm broke. l need help.

01:37:01.903 --> 01:37:04.654
Not now! Then.

01:37:05.739 --> 01:37:07.981
Now's no good.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.952
Now's too late.

01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:14.366
l crawled. l begged.

01:37:16.334 --> 01:37:18.907
l lost my girlfriend.

01:37:20.462 --> 01:37:22.918
l hate that you did this.

01:37:24.342 --> 01:37:28.210
Danny, l had to.
l had to find out who loved me.

01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:32.379
- Who...
- Nobody. Nobody loved you.

01:37:34.268 --> 01:37:35.597
Why should they?

01:37:38.064 --> 01:37:43.937
What's there to love?
What about you is there to love?

01:38:03.715 --> 01:38:08.592
l want a camera on the kid's father
when the kid's shooting the free throws.

01:38:08.804 --> 01:38:12.932
lf he misses, the expression
on the dad's face is another Emmy.

01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:15.180
Find the dad.

01:38:18.022 --> 01:38:21.106
- Mike, go back.
- Hey!

01:38:22.693 --> 01:38:25.230
- Stop!
- Girlie, if you don't sit down...

01:38:25.445 --> 01:38:28.019
Will you shut up a second?

01:38:32.203 --> 01:38:34.326
[man] l'll meet you over there.

01:38:46.718 --> 01:38:49.255
What happened?

01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:51.758
Uncle Joe was broke.

01:38:51.972 --> 01:38:54.545
- Come on.
- Broke.

01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:59.145
No, not just broke. ln debt.

01:38:59.355 --> 01:39:04.232
Everybody pushing and shoving,
and all the time the trough was empty.

01:39:08.531 --> 01:39:12.066
When did l get so obsessed with money?

01:39:12.284 --> 01:39:14.610
When did that happen?

01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:19.240
l mean, you've known me for years.
l was never like that.

01:39:19.459 --> 01:39:21.285
Was l?

01:39:21.502 --> 01:39:23.377
No.

01:39:27.634 --> 01:39:31.797
- What's going to happen to him?
- Uncle Joe?

01:39:32.013 --> 01:39:35.097
l assume my cousins will hang him.

01:39:35.308 --> 01:39:37.182
No, really.

01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:40.852
Really.

01:39:42.107 --> 01:39:45.357
l don't know. l don't care.

01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:47.850
You don't?

01:39:48.071 --> 01:39:51.522
Allow me to face up to it.
l wasn't there for him.

01:39:51.741 --> 01:39:54.114
l was there for the money, boom.

01:39:55.537 --> 01:40:00.246
That time when he told you
how scared he was to go into a home?

01:40:00.458 --> 01:40:03.662
You told me you felt sorry for him.

01:40:03.878 --> 01:40:05.836
l did.

01:40:06.506 --> 01:40:10.551
But don't you see? lt was an act.
He was putting on an act.

01:40:10.761 --> 01:40:14.425
- Anybody would have felt sorry for him.
- Even your cousins?

01:40:20.771 --> 01:40:23.772
[workman] Make sure you get
plenty of padding on there!

01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:27.309
Put it in last.

01:40:31.741 --> 01:40:33.983
Douglas. Douglas.

01:40:34.869 --> 01:40:36.363
Where's Uncle Joe?

01:40:36.579 --> 01:40:41.573
l couldn't say, sir.
l'm no longer in your uncle's employ.

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.828
- What?
- He can no longer pay my wages.

01:40:46.046 --> 01:40:49.084
Wages?
Don't you care what happens to him?

01:40:50.259 --> 01:40:53.628
Very droll, sir. Most amusing, sir.

01:40:53.887 --> 01:40:58.217
- Watch your back. Coming through.
- Where is he, in a nursing home?

01:40:58.434 --> 01:41:00.972
Out of the question. He can't afford it.

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:05.481
Hey. What...? What's he going to do?

01:41:05.691 --> 01:41:10.649
He can go dance the hully-gully
for all l care. Good day, sir.

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:40.889
[doctor being paged over tannoy]

01:41:47.692 --> 01:41:49.815
Where's your hat?

01:41:51.279 --> 01:41:54.364
Went in the auction. A buck's a buck.

01:41:54.575 --> 01:42:00.031
Your lawyer told me you were here.
What are you doing in the hospital?

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:02.655
l didn't feel good, stupid.

01:42:02.874 --> 01:42:06.540
- But a county ward?
- lt's all l can afford.

01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:13.133
lronic, huh?
l'm right back where my mother left me.

01:42:13.343 --> 01:42:18.254
You call me stupid. Work your way up
from nothing, from the street,

01:42:18.766 --> 01:42:21.436
you piss it all away.

01:42:21.644 --> 01:42:23.636
Did you just come to cheer me up, or what?

01:42:25.564 --> 01:42:29.229
- Come on. Where's all your crap?
- Huh?

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:33.061
Your stuff.
They didn't bring you in naked, did they?

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.697
- ln my bag.
- All right, come on, let's go.

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.323
- Where?
- What, suddenly you're particular?

01:42:43.416 --> 01:42:45.657
You're coming with me.

01:42:52.008 --> 01:42:57.215
Robin and l are getting married.
We decided to adopt you.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:03.515
- You and Robin...?
- We wanted to start a family anyway.

01:43:03.729 --> 01:43:06.764
At least this way
we know what we're getting.

01:43:10.402 --> 01:43:14.898
Signed you up for Little League.
Don't embarrass me.

01:43:23.456 --> 01:43:25.366
My son.

01:43:53.403 --> 01:43:56.738
Okey-doke. Watch your fingers.

01:43:56.949 --> 01:44:00.115
Hi, honey, l'm home!
Look what the stork brought us.

01:44:00.326 --> 01:44:02.865
- Hi, Uncle Joe.
- Hello, Robin.

01:44:04.539 --> 01:44:07.410
Danny bought me a hat.

01:44:07.627 --> 01:44:09.666
Smart choice.

01:44:10.755 --> 01:44:15.713
Well, this is my place,
and l think we'll all be very comfortable here.

01:44:17.386 --> 01:44:19.924
- Would you like to see your room?
- Sure.

01:44:20.139 --> 01:44:22.926
- Great.
- Here we go.

01:44:29.648 --> 01:44:35.272
There's a bed coming, and furniture.
We can squeeze this stuff into our room.

01:44:35.488 --> 01:44:39.983
- What do you think?
- l don't like it.

01:44:40.201 --> 01:44:44.744
- Robin went to a lot of trouble here.
- Sorry. l don't like it.

01:44:46.874 --> 01:44:51.418
Well...we could trade rooms.

01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:53.752
Come here.

01:45:03.182 --> 01:45:08.140
Danny and l will stay in there
and you can have this room. How about that?

01:45:11.608 --> 01:45:14.443
l don't like it.

01:45:14.653 --> 01:45:18.817
lt's probably temporary.
ln a year or so, Danny and l will buy a house.

01:45:19.032 --> 01:45:20.525
l won't like it.

01:45:22.369 --> 01:45:24.906
He's great, isn't he?

01:45:25.122 --> 01:45:27.874
He's like corn
that gets stuck in your teeth.

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:31.452
You keep sucking on it to get it out
but you can't!

01:45:35.673 --> 01:45:39.292
l'd like to go back to my mansion.
l love my mansion.

01:45:41.847 --> 01:45:43.721
Oh, God.

01:45:46.559 --> 01:45:49.097
Try to understand, OK?

01:45:51.648 --> 01:45:52.644
lt's gone.

01:45:55.319 --> 01:45:57.811
Everything is gone.

01:45:58.030 --> 01:46:02.608
You don't have your house.
You don't have your money.

01:46:02.826 --> 01:46:07.572
You don't have the scrapyard.
You don't even have your hat.

01:46:20.511 --> 01:46:23.084
Look out the window.

01:46:23.305 --> 01:46:25.346
Go ahead.

01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:55.121
- You're not broke, are you, Uncle Joe?
- l am richer than shit.

01:46:58.216 --> 01:47:04.385
Your attorneys, them hauling
your furniture out...you sitting in that ward?

01:47:04.598 --> 01:47:09.758
You put on a show for me.
The lawyers and l put on a show for you.

01:47:09.978 --> 01:47:13.263
l knew that guy wasn't your father.
Think l'm an idiot?

01:47:13.481 --> 01:47:17.182
And do you think l'm stupid enough
to lose my money?

01:47:17.402 --> 01:47:21.150
But why? l mean, why would you
make something like that up?

01:47:21.364 --> 01:47:26.074
l had to know who really loves me, huh?

01:47:28.663 --> 01:47:31.914
l found Molly. l like her, she's a nice kid.

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.284
Well, shall we go?

01:47:36.879 --> 01:47:39.086
l want you two to live with me.

01:47:39.299 --> 01:47:43.297
Not just live with me.
Whatever l own, you own.

01:47:43.512 --> 01:47:46.633
What's mine is yours. Ready?

01:47:48.225 --> 01:47:51.974
- l don't know what to say. lt's...
- No. No, wait, no!

01:47:52.187 --> 01:47:55.224
You can't do this to people.

01:47:55.441 --> 01:48:00.399
You can't lie and fake and manipulate.
l won't accept that.

01:48:00.612 --> 01:48:04.824
- So you don't want to live with me?
- You didn't let me finish.

01:48:06.493 --> 01:48:11.405
Just this once,
l'm going to let you off with a warning.

01:48:13.251 --> 01:48:14.910
Thank you.

01:48:15.127 --> 01:48:20.169
But you got to promise us,
no more deception.

01:48:20.382 --> 01:48:23.717
No more games. No more lies.

01:48:24.804 --> 01:48:27.175
You promise?

01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:31.138
l promise. Now, come on, let's go.

01:48:45.366 --> 01:48:48.616
# The best things in life are free

01:48:49.028 --> 01:48:52.030
# But you can keep them
