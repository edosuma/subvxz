WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.075
WITH MIKE WORKING IN ALASKA,

00:04.075 --> 00:06.207
SUSAN TOOK A JOB AS A NANNY.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.639
BREE'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH KEITH'S MOTHER...

00:08.639 --> 00:11.342
IS BREE THE ONE WHO'S GONNA BE
GIVING ME MY GRANDCHILDREN?

00:11.342 --> 00:13.214
GOT OFF TO A ROCKY START.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.046
THAT WAS
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.248
TOM AND RENEE HAD A SECRET.

00:17.248 --> 00:19.550
SHE CAN NEVER KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

00:19.550 --> 00:23.194
PAUL'S WIFE
HAD A CHANGE OF HEART...
 I WANNA MAKE LOVE AGAIN.

00:23.194 --> 00:26.026
AND A VERY BIG SECRET
OF HER OWN.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.198
BABY.

00:27.198 --> 00:28.659
MAMA.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.807
(Mary Alice) FELICIA TILLMAN
KNEW MANY THINGS.

00:36.807 --> 00:38.339
(clank)

00:38.339 --> 00:43.444
SHE KNEW PAUL YOUNG
HAD KILLED HER SISTER.

00:43.444 --> 00:49.350
SHE KNEW SHE HAD TO FIND PROOF.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.654
AND SHE KNEW
SHE WOULD NEED HELP.

00:55.326 --> 01:00.361
FELICIA ALSO KNEW SHE WAS
LUCKY TO HAVE A DAUGHTER

01:00.361 --> 01:04.394
WHO DID WHAT SHE WAS TOLD.

01:04.394 --> 01:06.397
HE'S SAID NOTHING TO YOU?

01:06.397 --> 01:08.699
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING THERE
FOR MONTHS NOW.

01:08.699 --> 01:10.701
WELL, I'VE TRIED
TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS,

01:10.701 --> 01:14.105
BUT HE REFUSES
TO DISCUSS AUNT MARTHA.
 DID YOU LOOK THROUGH HIS THINGS?

01:14.105 --> 01:17.108
MAYBE HE HAS SOME SORT
OF JOURNAL.
 WELL, I'VE LOOKED SOME.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.550
LOOK AGAIN.

01:20.851 --> 01:23.784
IS HE STILL BOTHERING YOU
FOR SEX?

01:23.784 --> 01:25.456
N-NOT REALLY.

01:25.456 --> 01:27.118
I'M SURPRISED.

01:27.118 --> 01:30.090
HE SEEMS LIKE THE TYPE WHO
WOULDN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

01:36.127 --> 01:39.330
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:39.330 --> 01:41.372
(whispers) BETH!

01:41.372 --> 01:44.635
HE WAS GOING TO KICK ME OUT.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.707
OH, PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.810
WE ALWAYS KNEW

01:49.810 --> 01:54.315
GETTING JUSTICE FOR AUNT MARTHA
WOULD REQUIRE SACRIFICES.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.489
BUT THIS...

01:58.489 --> 02:04.395
I ALLOWED MY OWN DAUGHTER
TO BE DEFILED BY THAT MAN.

02:04.395 --> 02:07.758
IT WASN'T THAT BAD, MAMA.

02:07.758 --> 02:11.502
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU ENJOYED IT?

02:11.502 --> 02:14.365
NO! OF COURSE NOT.

02:14.365 --> 02:19.210
IT JUST WASN'T AS UNPLEASANT
AS I THOUGHT IT... WOULD BE.

02:19.210 --> 02:24.915
(sighs) WELL, IF YOU'VE GOT
THE STOMACH FOR IT...

02:24.915 --> 02:27.418
THIS COULD WORK
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.620
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:29.620 --> 02:30.921
SEX MAKES MEN STUPID.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.923
THEY SAY THINGS IN THE DARK

02:32.923 --> 02:34.855
THEY CAN BARELY REMEMBER
COME SUNRISE.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.429
YOU WANT ME TO ASK
ABOUT AUNT MARTHA'S MURDER

02:38.429 --> 02:39.930
IN THE MIDDLE OF--

02:39.930 --> 02:42.763
I'M NOT SAYING USE IT
AS FOREPLAY.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.637
BUT AFTERWARDS, WHEN YOU'RE
BOTH JUST LYING THERE,

02:46.637 --> 02:48.769
WHEN HE'S...

02:48.769 --> 02:50.641
SPENT...

02:50.641 --> 02:52.773
GET HIM TALKING
ABOUT THE PAST.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.775
MAYBE HE'LL LET
SOME DETAIL SLIP,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.777
SOMETHING WE CAN USE, OKAY?

02:56.777 --> 03:00.781
I'LL TRY, MAMA.
I SHOULD GO.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.283
AND, BETH?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.915
SEX MAKES WOMEN STUPID, TOO.

03:04.915 --> 03:07.318
THEY START
FEELING THINGS THAT

03:07.318 --> 03:10.661
THEY HAVE
NO BUSINESS FEELING.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.664
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

03:13.664 --> 03:15.766
I DO, MAMA.

03:23.274 --> 03:27.878
YES, FELICIA TILLMAN
KNEW MANY THINGS,

03:27.878 --> 03:30.741
AND IF HER DAUGHTER
WERE STUPID ENOUGH

03:30.741 --> 03:33.914
TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH PAUL YOUNG,

03:33.914 --> 03:50.631
FELICIA KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE
TO PUNISH THEM BOTH.

03:50.631 --> 03:54.865
THANKSGIVING--IT'S A TIME
FOR DEFROSTING TURKEYS...

03:54.865 --> 03:58.809
FOR VISITING FAMILIES...

03:58.809 --> 04:02.913
FOR PERFORMING IN PAGEANTS.

04:02.913 --> 04:05.816
THANKSGIVING IS ALSO A TIME
FOR SHOPPING...

04:05.816 --> 04:08.649
WELL, DON'T JUST SIT THERE
SCRATCHING YOURSELF. HELP ME.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.382
AND STRESS.

04:11.382 --> 04:13.824
(sighs) (Spanish accent)
FRIJOLES, TAMALES?

04:13.824 --> 04:15.826
(normal voice) BABE, I THINK
YOU GOT THE WRONG BAGS.

04:15.826 --> 04:17.827
WHERE ARE THE YAMS
AND THE CRANBERRY SAUCE?

04:17.827 --> 04:20.331
HECTOR AND CARMEN
HAVE A BIG MEXICAN DINNER

04:20.331 --> 04:21.531
EVERY THANKSGIVING.

04:21.531 --> 04:23.534
SINCE WE INVITED THEM OVER,

04:23.534 --> 04:25.836
I TOLD THEM I'D SERVE
THEIR FAVORITE DISHES, LIKE...

04:25.836 --> 04:27.538
CHORIZO STUFFING, BOLLITOS,

04:27.538 --> 04:29.700
JALAPEÑO CORN BREAD.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.702
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
FOR GRACE.

04:31.702 --> 04:34.705
IT'S OUR FIRST HOLIDAY
WE'RE TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

04:34.705 --> 04:36.547
THAT WAS VERY SWEET
OF YOU.

04:36.547 --> 04:39.810
YEAH. SO GOOD LUCK.
WE EAT AT 2:00.

04:39.810 --> 04:40.881
WAIT, WAIT.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.913
I'M COOKING?

04:42.913 --> 04:45.416
YEAH. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
KNOWS ABOUT MEXICAN STUFF.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.887
YOU ROLL YOUR R's,
YOU CALL SOCCER...

04:46.887 --> 04:48.589
(Spanish accent) FúTBOL.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.691
YOU'RE MOCKING ME BECAUSE
I'M PROUD OF MY CULTURE?

04:50.691 --> 04:51.992
NO! I'M CELEBRATING IT.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.795
AND THERE'S TWO BAGS
OF YOUR CULTURE RIGHT THERE.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.368
START THE PARTY.

05:00.571 --> 05:01.972
SO, LYNETTE.
 HI.

05:01.972 --> 05:03.874
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THANKSGIVING?

05:03.874 --> 05:06.377
SAME AS ALWAYS--COOK BY MYSELF
FOR FOUR HOURS,

05:06.377 --> 05:08.379
CLEAN BY MYSELF
FOR THREE HOURS,

05:08.379 --> 05:10.080
EAT WITH MY FAMILY
FOR EIGHT MINUTES.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.513
WELL, THIS YEAR,
HOW ABOUT COMING TO--
 WE'RE IN.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.985
I HAVEN'T
EVEN INVITED YOU YET.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.988
YOU CAN INVITE ME OVER FOR
TURKEY AND A PUNCH IN THE FACE.

05:17.988 --> 05:21.422
IF IT GETS ME OUT OF COOKING,
I'M THERE.
 OH. WONDERFUL.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.425
OH. WAIT. SUSAN WAS ALREADY
COMING TO OUR PLACE.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.727
IS IT OKAY IF SHE COMES, TOO?

05:26.727 --> 05:28.729
WELL, I SUPPOSE
SHE'LL WANT OVERTIME,

05:28.729 --> 05:31.532
BUT I COULD USE
THE EXTRA KITCHEN HELP.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.764
AS A GUEST.

05:33.764 --> 05:35.105
OH, COME ON.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.067
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
AGAINST SUSAN?

05:37.067 --> 05:39.910
(sighs) SHE'S ALWAYS
SO PERKY AND POOR.

05:39.910 --> 05:42.443
IT'S AN ANNOYING COMBINATION.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.775
SHE'S MY FRIEND,
AND IT IS THANKSGIVING.

05:44.775 --> 05:47.618
I SUPPOSE IT IS A TIME
TO BE THANKFUL...

05:47.618 --> 05:50.020
AND I'M THANKFUL
I'M NOT HER.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.653
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
SHE CAN COME.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.955
(chuckles)

05:54.955 --> 05:58.028
(whispers) SHH, SHH.

05:58.028 --> 05:59.890
HEY.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.633
(door closes)
 THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF PLANS.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.865
WE'RE ALL HAVING THANKSGIVING
OVER AT RENEE'S. YOU, TOO.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.867
SHE'S OKAY WITH ME
AND M.J. COMING?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.440
OF COURSE. YOU KNOW HOW
SHE LOVES CHILDREN.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.041
YEAH. MEDIUM RARE.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.574
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.746
OH, I'M TRYING TO GET
PAIGE TO SLEEP,

06:15.746 --> 06:17.077
AND IF I STOP...

06:17.077 --> 06:19.049
(crying)

06:19.049 --> 06:20.881
THAT HAPPENS.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.383
I FIGURE 12 MORE LAPS,
AND SHE'LL BE ASLEEP,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.385
AND THEN I CAN PUT HER DOWN.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.887
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.389
I'M THINKING IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE SLEEP-TRAINED HER.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.791
SLEEP TRAIN?

06:30.791 --> 06:34.725
YEAH, YEAH. HERE.
YOU PUT 'EM IN THEIR CRIB,

06:34.725 --> 06:38.599
AND ESSENTIALLY, YOU LET 'EM
CRY IT OUT. COME ON.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.601
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.703
I JUST NEVER REALLY GOT
THE POINT OF IT.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.706
THE POINT IS SHE LEARNS
TO PUT HERSELF TO SLEEP.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.008
THE FIRST NIGHT SHE CRIES
FOR 20 MINUTES,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.911
THE SECOND, TEN.
BEFORE LONG, EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.913
EXCEPT
THE LONELY LITTLE PERSON

06:52.913 --> 06:56.046
WHO WAS CRYING AND NOW THINKS
SHE WAS ABANDONED.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.048
I KNOW IT SOUNDS HARSH,

06:58.048 --> 07:01.752
BUT IT'S REALLY A GIFT
YOU'RE GIVING THE CHILD.
 (Paige crying)

07:01.752 --> 07:04.054
THE GIFT
OF A TEAR-STAINED PILLOW.

07:04.054 --> 07:06.757
WHAT A LUCKY LITTLE GIRL.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.207
SOMETHING WRONG?

07:18.869 --> 07:21.712
NO.

07:21.712 --> 07:23.574
YOU SURE?

07:23.574 --> 07:25.876
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU WERE
A MILLION MILES AWAY

07:25.876 --> 07:28.879
WHILE WE WERE MAKING LOVE.

07:28.879 --> 07:31.221
WELL...

07:31.221 --> 07:33.053
IT'S JUST THAT...

07:33.053 --> 07:35.686
TALK TO ME.

07:35.686 --> 07:40.160
I MET A WOMAN TODAY
A-AT THE STORE,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.635
AND WHEN I TOLD HER
WHO I WAS MARRIED TO...

07:44.635 --> 07:47.998
SHE SAID YOU KILLED
MARTHA HUBER.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.701
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT IDLE GOSSIP?

07:50.701 --> 07:52.703
SHE SAID YOU HAD A MOTIVE.

07:52.703 --> 07:54.775
MARTHA WAS BLACKMAILING
YOUR WIFE.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.077
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.682
(sighs)

08:01.682 --> 08:03.854
YOU ARE A PASSIONATE MAN.

08:03.854 --> 08:05.556
I KNOW THAT FIRSTHAND,

08:05.556 --> 08:08.859
BUT SOMETIMES OUR EMOTIONS
CAN MAKE US DO CRAZY THINGS.

08:08.859 --> 08:11.722
IF MARTHA WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR MARY ALICE'S SUICIDE--

08:11.722 --> 08:13.724
STOP IT.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.026
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT I AM CAPABLE

08:16.026 --> 08:18.268
OF KILLING ANOTHER PERSON?

08:18.268 --> 08:20.771
MARTHA'S SISTER
SURE THINKS YOU ARE.

08:20.771 --> 08:23.804
WELL, HER OPINION
DOESN'T MATTER.
 WHY NOT?

08:23.804 --> 08:26.106
EVERYBODY KNOWS FELICIA TILLMAN
IS CRAZY.

08:27.778 --> 08:29.710
(sighs)
MARTHA SAID TO MY WIFE

08:29.710 --> 08:33.243
THAT SHE COULDN'T TRUST A THING
THAT HER SISTER SAID

08:33.243 --> 08:36.046
DUE TO HER SEVERE
MENTAL PROBLEMS.

08:36.046 --> 08:37.888
REALLY?

08:37.888 --> 08:39.820
YOU'RE SURPRISED?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.822
THE WOMAN CUT OFF
HER OWN FINGERS

08:41.822 --> 08:43.823
TO FRAME ME FOR MURDER.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.526
(chuckles) WHO DOES THAT?

08:47.798 --> 08:50.801
(footsteps retreat)

08:53.163 --> 08:55.836
(under breath)
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

09:06.677 --> 09:08.749
BREE?

09:08.749 --> 09:11.051
I BROUGHT THESE
SO IF YOU SAW ME COMING,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.753
YOU WOULDN'T SHOOT ME.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.688
UH, KEITH TOLD ME
YOU HAVE GUNS?

09:19.830 --> 09:23.894
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME
OFF THE HOOK. (chuckles)

09:23.894 --> 09:26.236
IN MY DEFENSE,
I'M AN UGLY DRUNK.

09:26.236 --> 09:28.739
WELL, YOU FOUND OUT
YOUR SON WAS DATING

09:28.739 --> 09:30.240
A SLIGHTLY OLDER WOMAN.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.803
OF COURSE YOU WERE
THROWN OFF BALANCE.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.244
IT WASN'T JUST THAT.

09:34.244 --> 09:37.007
I, UH, I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH SOME STUFF LATELY.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.009
OH. IS, UH, EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:39.009 --> 09:42.713
EVER SINCE RICHARD RETIRED
FROM THE ARMY,

09:42.713 --> 09:45.786
THINGS HAVE BEEN...
STRAINED.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.788
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.720
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.722
HE WAS ALWAYS
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY.

09:51.722 --> 09:55.025
WE GOT SO GOOD AT BEING APART,
WE FORGOT HOW TO BE TOGETHER.

09:55.025 --> 09:56.927
WELL, HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THIS
WITH HIM?

09:56.927 --> 09:58.929
I WANT TO,
BUT EVERY TIME WE TALK,

09:58.929 --> 10:00.931
IT TURNS INTO A FIGHT.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.933
TRYING TO PICK A MOVIE
FRIDAY NIGHT--

10:02.933 --> 10:05.205
THAT--THAT TURNED INTO
A 3-HOUR SCREAMING MATCH.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.207
WELL, HOLDING IT INSIDE
ISN'T THE SOLUTION.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.379
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.742
TRUST ME.
YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.745
WELL, IT'S JUST SO MUCH EASIER
WHEN KEITH IS AROUND.

10:14.745 --> 10:16.687
HE'S THE ONE THING
WE AGREE ON.

10:16.687 --> 10:19.619
I MEAN, I'M GLAD YOU TWO ARE
SPENDING THANKSGIVING TOGETHER,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.753
BUT WE'RE SURE GONNA
MISS HIM AT OUR TABLE.
 HMM. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

10:22.753 --> 10:25.255
(gasps) OH, OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO. NO.

10:25.255 --> 10:27.627
I-I WASN'T FISHING
FOR AN INVITATION.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.160
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T.
WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.662
YOU ARE SO SWEET,

10:31.662 --> 10:36.336
AND I PROMISE TO BE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.839
I KNOW YOU WILL,
BECAUSE AS KEITH TOLD YOU,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.640
I HAVE GUNS.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.375
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.878
I WAS TRYING TO GET MIKE
ON THE PHONE,

10:47.878 --> 10:49.880
BUT BETWEEN THE TIME CHANGE
AND HIS SCHEDULE,

10:49.880 --> 10:52.652
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO CONNECT.
 AW, THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.856
I JUST PUT PAIGE DOWN FOR A NAP.
COME. HAVE SOME ICED TEA.

10:55.856 --> 11:00.660
(Paige crying)

11:00.660 --> 11:04.835
MAYBE YOU CAN TRY MIKE TONIGHT
AFTER WORK.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.336
MAYBE.

11:06.336 --> 11:07.998
(Paige wailing)

11:07.998 --> 11:10.741
WOW. SHE SOUNDS
REALLY UNHAPPY.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.974
SHOULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.146
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:16.146 --> 11:17.447
(click)

11:17.447 --> 11:19.950
SO... WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE
IN ALASKA

11:19.950 --> 11:21.952
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR?

11:21.952 --> 11:23.814
COLD.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.160
GOOD TEA.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.162
REALLY, REALLY GOOD TEA.

11:32.162 --> 11:34.765
ALTHOUGH IT COULD USE
SOME LEMON.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.767
UM, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.777
(whispers) OH. SHH.

11:46.777 --> 11:47.938
(fusses)

11:47.938 --> 11:49.940
SUSAN.
 (gasps)

11:49.940 --> 11:52.482
WE STOPPED KEEPING LEMONS
UNDER THE BABY A WHILE AGO.

11:52.482 --> 11:54.815
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.818
LOOK, IT'S NOT FUN FOR ME
TO HEAR PAIGE CRY EITHER,

11:57.818 --> 12:01.151
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, IT'S GOING
TO BE BETTER FOR HER.

12:01.151 --> 12:04.094
IT'S NOT BETTER FOR ME. I TRIED
LETTING HER CRY YESTERDAY.

12:04.094 --> 12:07.097
IT WAS TOO UPSETTING.
LOOK AT MY NAILS. THEY'RE GONE.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.399
I HATE TO SAY IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

12:09.399 --> 12:12.402
BUT THIS IS YOUR JOB.
I NEED YOU TO DO IT MY WAY.

12:12.402 --> 12:15.505
I GET IT. YOU'RE THE BOSS.
THE MEAN, COLD--
 SUSAN.

12:15.505 --> 12:18.368
SORRY.

12:18.368 --> 12:20.410
(whispers)
UNFEELING BOSS.

12:22.512 --> 12:24.274
(doorbell rings)

12:26.777 --> 12:29.319
OH. HEY. HI.

12:29.319 --> 12:31.822
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE CABLE GUY.

12:31.822 --> 12:34.284
I'M TRYING TO GET
FREE PREMIUM CHANNELS.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.286
(chuckles) NO, NO, JUST ME.

12:36.286 --> 12:38.789
LYNETTE WANTED ME TO
BRING THIS OVER FOR THURSDAY.

12:38.789 --> 12:41.792
SHE DIDN'T THINK IT'D STAND
A CHANCE AT OUR PLACE.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.393
(chuckles) OKAY. BYE.

12:43.393 --> 12:44.795
UH, TOM?

12:44.795 --> 12:47.167
HUH?

12:47.167 --> 12:50.300
OH. OH, OH, RIGHT.
HERE. (chuckles)

12:50.300 --> 12:52.803
DO YOU MIND PUTTING THAT
IN THE KITCHEN?

12:52.803 --> 12:55.505
MY HANDS ARE KINDA...

12:55.505 --> 12:58.508
SURE. SURE.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.010
SO... HERE YOU GO.

13:00.010 --> 13:03.383
CHOCOLATE CREAM THIGH--
P-PIE.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.555
I SAID "PIE."

13:05.555 --> 13:08.158
ARE YOU BLUSHING?

13:08.158 --> 13:09.990
TOM, YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

13:09.990 --> 13:14.825
I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU
CAUGHT ME IN A TOWEL THEN, TOO.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.498
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.832
BLUE TOWEL, WHITE STRIPES,
CONEY ISLAND BEACH CLUB.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.876
I-IT WAS A GOOD TOWEL.

13:25.876 --> 13:28.538
UH, TOM.

13:28.538 --> 13:32.412
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.284
WHAT?

13:34.284 --> 13:36.286
OH, RELAX.
I'M NOT HITTING ON YOU.

13:36.286 --> 13:37.587
IT'S JUST...

13:37.587 --> 13:41.591
WELL, COME ON. I'M DIVORCED.
I'M VULNERABLE.

13:41.591 --> 13:44.394
I'LL TAKE MY COMPLIMENTS
WHERE I CAN.

13:44.394 --> 13:50.130
I KNOW IT'S BEEN OVER 20 YEARS,
BUT HOW DO I LOOK?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.162
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.466
I GOTTA GO. (chuckles)

13:56.466 --> 13:58.909
(clatter)

13:58.909 --> 14:00.370
TABLE.

14:03.313 --> 14:05.245
(door closes)

14:05.245 --> 14:06.516
OHH!

14:06.516 --> 14:07.517
OHH!

14:07.517 --> 14:08.418
OHH.

14:08.418 --> 14:10.120
(exhales deeply)

14:10.120 --> 14:11.251
(sighs)

14:11.251 --> 14:12.382
(chuckles)

14:12.382 --> 14:14.084
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

14:14.084 --> 14:17.387
I INVITED YOUR PARENTS
TO THANKSGIVING DINNER.

14:17.387 --> 14:22.432
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST TEN MINUTES
REMINDED YOU OF MY PARENTS?

14:22.432 --> 14:25.535
I WAS WORKING UP THE MENU
IN MY HEAD.

14:25.535 --> 14:26.566
(both chuckle)

14:26.566 --> 14:28.568
SO WHEN YOU WERE MOANING--

14:28.568 --> 14:30.570
I THOUGHT OF A NEW RECIPE

14:30.570 --> 14:33.173
FOR CHESTNUT STUFFING
WITH PANCETTA.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.975
THAT DOES SOUND GOOD.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.346
MM.

14:36.346 --> 14:39.349
AH. I WISH IT WAS JUST
YOU AND ME FOR THANKSGIVING.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.651
I HAD A WHOLE NIGHT PLANNED.

14:41.651 --> 14:45.055
WELL, HOW ABOUT WE DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL NEXT WEEKEND?

14:45.055 --> 14:46.886
JUST YOU AND ME?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.888
YES. WE'LL GO
SOMEPLACE ROMANTIC,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.061
AND I WILL PLAN
THE WHOLE THING.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.062
MWAH.
 MMM.

14:52.062 --> 14:53.293
GREAT.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.665
JUST DON'T DO IT
WHILE WE'RE MAKING LOVE.

14:55.665 --> 14:57.427
(chuckles)

14:57.427 --> 15:00.500
I AM FAMISHED. HOW ABOUT
I RUMMAGE AROUND IN YOUR KITCHEN

15:00.500 --> 15:03.433
AND FIND US SOMETHING
TO EAT?
 MM.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.042
(drawer slides open)

15:13.913 --> 15:14.985
(sighs)

15:33.403 --> 15:35.105
HEY! LOOK WHO'S HERE.

15:35.105 --> 15:36.236
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.968
HEY, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.310
AY, IT ALL SMELLS
SO WONDERFUL.

15:40.310 --> 15:43.313
WELL, CARLOS AND I HAVE BEEN
WORKING OUR BUTTS OFF ALL DAY.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.315
SHE DID HER HAIR FOR TWO HOURS

15:45.315 --> 15:47.617
AND TOLD ME WHERE
THE CAN OPENER WAS.
 WHO SET THE TABLE?

15:47.617 --> 15:49.379
JUANITA.
 UNDER MY SUPERVISION.

15:51.381 --> 15:54.154
WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 Sí.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.427
GRACE, SWEETIE, YOU WANNA GO UP
AND PLAY WITH JUANITA AND CELIA

15:57.427 --> 15:58.989
BEFORE WE EAT?
 YEAH.

15:58.989 --> 16:00.530
SO WHO WANTS A DRINK?

16:00.530 --> 16:03.593
I MADE MARGARITAS.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.635
SHE IS VERY PROUD
OF HER CULTURE.

16:05.635 --> 16:10.700
HEY. CARLOS, WHAT'S SPANISH
FOR "NO SEX FOR A MONTH"?

16:10.700 --> 16:12.402
AH, CARMEN KNOWS.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.204
(chuckles)

16:14.204 --> 16:16.476
SO, GABY,
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH THE PIES?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.508
(gasps)

16:18.508 --> 16:19.709
WHAT?

16:19.709 --> 16:23.213
I KINDA FORGOT TO PICK 'EM UP.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.485
I COOKED THIS ENTIRE MEAL,
AND YOU FORGET DESSERT?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.357
YOU HAD ONE THING TO DO.

16:27.357 --> 16:29.689
IT WAS YOUR WHOLE
"WHERE'S THE CAN OPENER?" THING.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.063
IT JUST THREW ME.
 WELL, GO THROW YOURSELF
IN THE CAR AND GET THE PIES.

16:33.063 --> 16:35.495
I CAN'T DRIVE.
I JUST HAD A GLASS OF WINE.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.598
WE'LL JUST HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
FOR DESSERT.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.131
I THINK I HAVE SOME
LEFTOVER HALLOWEEN CANDY...

16:41.131 --> 16:43.133
AND PUDDING MIX.
WHO DOESN'T LOVE PUDDING?

16:43.133 --> 16:46.636
GABY... GET THE PIES.

16:46.636 --> 16:49.709
UH... I CAN DRIVE YOU.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.411
THANK YOU, HECTOR.

16:51.411 --> 16:55.615
OH, FINE. LET'S GO GET
YOUR PRECIOUS PIES.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.419
AND LOSE THE ATTITUDE.
THIS IS YOUR SCREWUP, NOT MINE.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.121
CARLOS, WHAT'S SPANISH

17:01.121 --> 17:03.123
FOR "YOU'RE SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH TONIGHT"?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.356
(chuckles) CARMEN'S GOT
THAT ONE, TOO.

17:06.356 --> 17:08.228
(chuckles) SHE...

17:11.501 --> 17:13.403
HEY, RENEE.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.335
HAPPY, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.568
OKAY, YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT.
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

17:18.568 --> 17:22.342
OH. HELLO, M.J.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.513
M.J., WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO MRS. PERRY?

17:24.513 --> 17:26.616
SHE NEEDS MEDICATION?

17:28.648 --> 17:31.351
(whispers) THAT'S WHAT WE SAY
ABOUT HER.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.354
WHAT DO WE SAY TO HER?
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.585
(chuckles)

17:35.585 --> 17:37.527
PRECIOUS.

17:37.527 --> 17:41.391
WHAT'S THIS CHALK LINE?

17:41.391 --> 17:43.463
NO KIDS BEYOND THIS POINT.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.596
YOUR MOMMY CAN BRING
YOUR FOOD TO YOU.

17:46.596 --> 17:49.699
SERIOUSLY? THE KIDS' TABLE'S
IN THE DRIVEWAY?

17:49.699 --> 17:52.742
I PUT IT IN THE STREET,
BUT THE COPS MADE ME MOVE IT.

17:52.742 --> 17:53.773
HI.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.475
HEY, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.747
(door closes)
 OH. WHERE'S MY LITTLE PAIGE?

17:57.747 --> 18:00.750
OH, WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER
ON HER SLEEP SCHEDULE,

18:00.750 --> 18:02.752
SO PORTER AND PRESTON
ARE WATCHING HER.

18:02.752 --> 18:05.655
BUT DON'T WORRY, SUSAN.
I TOLD THEM IF SHE CRIES,

18:05.655 --> 18:08.818
THEY CAN PICK HER UP
AFTER 20 MINUTES.
 20 MINUTES. YOU'RE UP
TO 20 MINUTES NOW.

18:08.818 --> 18:11.521
IF THEY EVEN HEAR HER
OVER THE FOOTBALL GAME.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.793
(chuckles) WHAT?

18:16.166 --> 18:17.167
(sighs)

18:17.167 --> 18:20.370
(doorbell rings)

18:20.370 --> 18:21.631
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.303
WHAT?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.305
TOLD YOU SHE FORGOT.
LET'S GO.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.478
NO. NO. REMEMBER HOW AWFUL
YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

18:28.478 --> 18:30.480
ROY AND I SPENT
LAST THANKSGIVING

18:30.480 --> 18:33.483
AT PANCAKE CASTLE AND YOU
INVITED US TO YOUR HOUSE

18:33.483 --> 18:35.185
FOR THE NEXT YEAR?

18:35.185 --> 18:37.387
IT'S NEXT YEAR.

18:37.387 --> 18:40.150
I'M... SORRY.
IT SLIPPED MY MIND.

18:40.150 --> 18:43.122
WELL, THAT'S OKAY. WE CAN
GO BACK TO PANCAKE CASTLE.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.424
NO, WE CAN'T.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.426
THE BOARD OF HEALTH
SHUT 'EM DOWN.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.329
THOSE WEREN'T BLUEBERRIES.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.830
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.433
OF COURSE YOU'RE WELCOME
TO EAT WITH US.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.366
WELL, THANK YOU, BREE.
 (Keith) HEY. WE'RE HERE.

18:56.366 --> 19:02.141
OH, LOOK. INVITED GUESTS.
WE'LL GET OUT OF THE WAY.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.245
KEITH.
 HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.616
RICHARD, MARY.

19:06.616 --> 19:09.549
THEY WERE HONKING AT YOU BECAUSE
YOU WERE DRIVING SLOW

19:09.549 --> 19:11.251
IN THE FAST LANE.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
NO. I WAS DRIVING THE LEGAL
SPEED LIMIT IN THE LEFT LANE.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.256
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS
THE FAST LANE.
 HI.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.729
HAPPY THANKSGIVING. WE'D HAVE
BEEN HERE SOONER, BUT, UH--
 DROP IT, RICHARD.

19:24.734 --> 19:28.638
(horns honking)

19:28.638 --> 19:30.340
(sighs) COME ON. MOVE!

19:30.340 --> 19:32.302
I THINK IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

19:32.302 --> 19:34.374
WELL, THEY BETTER BE DEAD.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.376
THE BAKERY CLOSES
IN TEN MINUTES.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.408
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
FORGET THE PIES.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.910
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IF I SHOW UP EMPTY-HANDED,

19:40.910 --> 19:43.453
CARLOS WILL GO
ALL RICKY RICARDO ON MY ASS.

19:43.453 --> 19:44.914
(chuckles)

19:44.914 --> 19:47.487
(sighs) TAKE THE SHOULDER.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.219
WHAT?

19:49.219 --> 19:51.891
IT'S TOTALLY CLEAR, AND WE CAN
PASS BY THIS WHOLE MESS.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.294
GABY, IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.296
HECTOR, I AM SWEATING
IN A PICKUP,

19:56.296 --> 19:59.899
AND MY BUZZ IS WEARING OFF.
YOU DO NOT WANNA TANGLE WITH ME.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.502
PUNCH IT!
 (tires peal)

20:08.378 --> 20:10.310
MAYBE HE DIDN'T SEE US.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.713
(siren wailing, tires peal)

20:13.713 --> 20:17.216
(police radio chatter)

20:17.216 --> 20:18.448
SIR...

20:18.448 --> 20:21.351
YOU DO REALIZE THAT THE SHOULDER
IS USED JUST FOR EMERGENCIES?

20:21.351 --> 20:23.853
OFFICER, HI.
ARE WE GLAD TO SEE YOU.

20:23.853 --> 20:26.356
WE COULD REALLY USE
A POLICE ESCORT TO THE BAKERY.

20:26.356 --> 20:28.358
IT CLOSES IN TEN MINUTES.

20:28.358 --> 20:29.999
THAT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY,
MA'AM.

20:29.999 --> 20:34.334
"MA'AM"? OW. TALK ABOUT
POLICE BRUTALITY.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.666
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE.

20:36.666 --> 20:39.309
I-I HAVE THE REGISTRATION.

20:41.511 --> 20:45.415
AND DO YOU HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE?

20:48.318 --> 20:51.851
SIR... ARE YOU A CITIZEN
OF THE UNITED STATES?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.353
HEY! RACIST MUCH?

20:53.353 --> 20:56.286
JUST BECAUSE HE'S GOT DARK SKIN
AND DRIVES A CLUNKER

20:56.286 --> 20:58.288
AND HAS A COAT HANGER
FOR AN ANTENNA

20:58.288 --> 20:59.929
DOESN'T MAKE HIM ILLEGAL.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.531
GABY, PLEASE!

21:01.531 --> 21:03.533
HE HAS RIGHTS.
HE PAYS TAXES.

21:03.533 --> 21:05.865
WE'RE GETTING YOUR NAME,
OFFICER... MARTINEZ.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.297
DAMN! (sighs)

21:07.297 --> 21:10.300
JUST GIVE HIM YOUR LICENSE
SO WE CAN GET OUTTA HERE.

21:12.742 --> 21:15.044
(sighs)

21:15.044 --> 21:16.606
HECTOR?

21:16.606 --> 21:18.608
SIR,
STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE

21:18.608 --> 21:21.981
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE CAR, PLEASE.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.483
(seat belt clicks)

21:25.615 --> 21:27.286
HECTOR.

21:36.896 --> 21:37.897
OKAY!

21:37.897 --> 21:41.331
(girls shouting playfully)

21:41.331 --> 21:42.772
ISN'T THAT YOUR TRUCK?

21:42.772 --> 21:46.436
(sputtering)

21:46.436 --> 21:48.438
WHY IS IT MOVING LIKE THAT?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.712
(engine rattling, brakes squeal)

21:52.712 --> 21:54.884
WHERE'S MY HUSBAND?

21:54.884 --> 21:56.546
WHERE'S THE PIE?

21:56.546 --> 21:58.548
GABY, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:58.548 --> 22:00.620
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.092
THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME
DRIVING STICK SHIFT,

22:03.092 --> 22:04.323
AND MY NERVES ARE SHATTERED.
 WELL, WHERE'S HECTOR?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.925
HE GOT ARRESTED.
 ARRESTED? WHY?

22:05.925 --> 22:09.028
WELL, TRAFFIC WAS AWFUL,
AND THE BAKERY WAS CLOSING,

22:09.028 --> 22:11.531
SO HECTOR--
A-AND I BEGGED HIM NOT TO,

22:11.531 --> 22:15.935
DROVE UP ON THE SHOULDER,
AND THE POLICE CAUGHT US.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.437
POLICE?

22:17.437 --> 22:21.411
GRACE, GET IN THE TRUCK NOW.
 BUT WE HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

22:21.411 --> 22:24.113
I DON'T CARE. LET'S GO!
WHERE'S MY PURSE?

22:24.113 --> 22:26.345
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.677
I THINK THEY'RE ILLEGALS.

22:27.677 --> 22:29.579
ARE THEY GONNA DEPORT HECTOR?

22:29.579 --> 22:32.582
I DON'T KNOW. THEY JUST
TOOK HIM AND LEFT ME IN A CAR

22:32.582 --> 22:34.924
THAT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DRIVE.
 OKAY, CARMEN, WAIT.

22:34.924 --> 22:37.587
WE CAN GET YOUR HUSBAND OUT
OF THIS. WE'LL HIRE A LAWYER.

22:37.587 --> 22:40.590
THEY WILL HAVE HIM ON A BUS
BACK TO MéXICO BY TOMORROW.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.392
I HAVE TO MOVE
OUT OF OUR HOUSE

22:42.392 --> 22:44.394
BEFORE THEY TRACK DOWN
OUR ADDRESS.
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

22:44.394 --> 22:47.467
I HAVE RELATIVES IN TEXAS.
WE'LL STAY WITH THEM

22:47.467 --> 22:50.039
UNTIL I CAN THINK
OF WHAT TO DO NEXT.
 BUT WHAT ABOUT GRACE?
WHEN WILL I SEE HER AGAIN?

22:50.039 --> 22:52.742
I DON'T KNOW.

22:52.742 --> 22:54.404
SAY GOOD-BYE, GRACE.

22:54.404 --> 22:58.107
GOOD-BYE, GABY.

23:06.115 --> 23:09.088
HEY, KIDS, I PUT SOME SNACKS
ON THE TABLE.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.090
MRS. PERRY SLAPPED THE CATERER,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.092
SO DINNER'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE LATE.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.695
(crying in distance)
 DO YOU HEAR CRYING?

23:15.695 --> 23:17.427
MAYBE IT'S THE CATERER.

23:17.427 --> 23:19.429
NO, I THINK IT'S PAIGE.

23:19.429 --> 23:22.532
OH, YEAH. SHE'S BEEN CRYING
FOR A LONG TIME.

23:22.532 --> 23:24.704
SHE HAS?

23:24.704 --> 23:27.707
(crying continues)

23:29.408 --> 23:30.910
(speaking inaudibly)

23:30.910 --> 23:35.745
(sighs) WHO WANTS TO PLAY
SOME FOOTBALL?

23:35.745 --> 23:38.147
OKAY. GO LONG, GO LONG.

23:38.147 --> 23:40.119
OOPS! THAT'S MY BAD!

23:40.119 --> 23:42.622
I'LL GET IT! (laughs)

23:44.053 --> 23:47.156
OH! LOOK! HA! DID IT AGAIN.

23:47.156 --> 23:51.160
I'LL GET IT!

23:51.160 --> 23:54.163
(crying continues)

23:56.866 --> 23:57.967
WHOA!

23:57.967 --> 23:59.168
OH!

23:59.168 --> 24:02.672
(Paige crying)

24:02.672 --> 24:05.174
(man calling game indistinctly
on TV)

24:05.174 --> 24:08.017
LET'S GO, BOYS. COME ON!
 3rd AND 6.
YOU GOTTA THROW IT.

24:08.017 --> 24:10.650
(crying continues)
 OH, HE'S NOT GONNA.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.582
(man speaking indistinctly)

24:12.582 --> 24:14.584
COME ON!
THROW THE BALL!

24:14.584 --> 24:17.086
(crying continues)
 OHH!

24:17.086 --> 24:19.589
UGH. IT'S LIKE
THEY'RE TRYING TO LOSE.

24:19.589 --> 24:23.092
NOW 3rd AND 16 FROM THE 16
TO GIVE TO BLAKE ON THE DRAW,

24:23.092 --> 24:25.795
AND BLAKE IS HAMMERED
AT THE LINE FOR NO GAIN.

24:25.795 --> 24:28.067
OHH!
 COME ON!

24:28.067 --> 24:29.999
SO, UH, RICHARD, TELL US,

24:29.999 --> 24:33.042
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR RETIREMENT?

24:33.042 --> 24:35.705
WE'RE, UH,
WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING THAT.

24:35.705 --> 24:41.050
HE WANTS TO SAIL DOWN THE COAST
OF SOUTH AMERICA BY HIMSELF.

24:41.050 --> 24:44.013
BREE, THIS CRANBERRY SAUCE IS
DELICIOUS. WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?

24:44.013 --> 24:46.115
WELL--
 MIGHT I REMIND YOU,

24:46.115 --> 24:48.117
THE PLAN WAS ALWAYS FOR US

24:48.117 --> 24:50.059
TO SAIL DOWN THE COAST
OF SOUTH AMERICA.
 OH. (chuckles)

24:50.059 --> 24:53.222
PLEASE TELL US THAT SECRET,
BREE. I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

24:53.222 --> 24:56.095
IS IT CINNAMON?

24:57.897 --> 25:01.030
IF IT ISN'T,
CAN WE TALK ABOUT CINNAMON?

25:01.030 --> 25:04.073
I KNEW A STRIPPER IN BALTIMORE
NAMED CINNAMON.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.205
NICE BROAD.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.907
YOU CHANGED THE PLAN.

25:07.907 --> 25:11.180
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT SAID
YOU WANTED TO KEEP WORKING.

25:11.180 --> 25:13.242
WELL, I'M SORRY IF I BUILT UP
A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE

25:13.242 --> 25:16.245
WHILE YOU WERE TRAIPSING
AROUND THE WORLD.
 TRAIPSING?

25:16.245 --> 25:17.987
YES.
 LIKE WHEN I TRAIPSED
THROUGH IRAQ.

25:17.987 --> 25:20.089
IRAQ! MY GOODNESS.
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

25:20.089 --> 25:23.853
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT NOW,
DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD.

25:27.697 --> 25:30.700
SO... RICHARD, WE KNOW
THAT YOU LIKE SAILING.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.162
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MARY?
DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?

25:33.162 --> 25:34.163
ASK HIM.

25:34.163 --> 25:35.865
EXCUSE ME?

25:35.865 --> 25:37.867
HE HAS KNOWN ME FOR 35 YEARS.

25:37.867 --> 25:40.940
I'D BE CURIOUS IF HE COULD NAME
EVEN ONE THING I LIKE TO DO.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.813
UM...

25:43.813 --> 25:45.044
BITCH?

25:48.618 --> 25:50.620
NO. THE STRIPPER'S NAME
WAS GINGER.

25:50.620 --> 25:54.784
CINNAMON WAS HER SISTER.
KILLED BY A CAB.

25:54.784 --> 25:57.787
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

25:57.787 --> 26:00.960
DAD, MOM. (clears throat)
COME ON. YOU'RE GUESTS HERE.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.094
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER?
IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A WALL.
 A WALL THAT PAID
FOR YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL

26:05.094 --> 26:07.797
AFTER YOUR HOMEMADE WOODEN
PUZZLE BUSINESS WENT BELLY-UP.

26:07.797 --> 26:10.099
AND EVERYTHING YOU EVER DID
WAS A SUCCESS?

26:10.099 --> 26:12.802
IRAQ? NICE JOB!

26:14.043 --> 26:17.006
I CAUGHT SOME SHRAPNEL
IN KOREA.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.979
CAME THIS CLOSE
TO BEING A LADY. (laughs)

26:19.979 --> 26:23.152
SEE, BREE? THIS IS JUST
 WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

26:23.152 --> 26:25.715
YOU--YOU TALKED TO MY MOTHER?

26:25.715 --> 26:28.017
BREE SAID I SHOULD TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL.

26:28.017 --> 26:31.961
WELL, HERE IS HOW I FEEL.
I WANT A DIVORCE.

26:31.961 --> 26:35.194
WHAT?
 THANK YOU, BREE.
I DO FEEL BETTER.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.927
YOU TOLD MY MOM
TO GET A DIVORCE?

26:37.927 --> 26:39.629
I NEVER SAID "DIVORCE."

26:39.629 --> 26:42.371
YOU WANT OUT OF THIS?
FINE! I'M HAPPY TO OBLIGE!

26:42.371 --> 26:46.676
DAD! MOM, WAIT!

26:48.678 --> 26:52.942
AND YOU DIDN'T WANNA COME.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.151
I LOVE THE STUFFING.

27:02.151 --> 27:04.754
ARE YOU SURE?
NOT TOO DRY?

27:04.754 --> 27:06.355
NO. IT'S YUMMY.
 HMM.

27:06.355 --> 27:08.057
DID YOU USE PECANS?

27:08.057 --> 27:09.999
YES. IT'S MY MOTHER'S RECIPE.

27:09.999 --> 27:12.301
IT'S PROBABLY A LOT DIFFERENT
FROM THE STUFFING

27:12.301 --> 27:15.905
YOU HAD AS A KID.

27:15.905 --> 27:19.168
ACTUALLY, MAMA AND I DIDN'T
REALLY CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING.

27:19.168 --> 27:20.810
WHAT?

27:20.810 --> 27:24.113
DADDY LEFT
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

27:24.113 --> 27:25.414
AFTER THAT, MAMA SAID

27:25.414 --> 27:28.117
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

27:28.117 --> 27:31.320
SO YOU NEVER
HAD PEOPLE OVER?

27:31.320 --> 27:34.083
NO. IT WAS ALWAYS JUST...

27:34.083 --> 27:35.725
MAMA AND ME.

27:35.725 --> 27:38.127
THAT'S TOO BAD.

27:39.729 --> 27:42.431
WHEN I WAS 12,
I DID ASK MAMA

27:42.431 --> 27:46.866
IF I COULD HAVE A FRIEND
FROM SCHOOL TO EAT WITH US.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.267
DANNY SULLIVAN.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.400
I DIDN'T TELL HER
I'D INVITED A BOY

27:51.400 --> 27:53.672
UNTIL THANKSGIVING MORNING.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.005
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

27:56.005 --> 27:59.148
SHE STARTED SCREAMING
AT ME...

27:59.148 --> 28:03.813
SAYING BOYS WERE
ONLY AFTER ONE THING.

28:03.813 --> 28:06.956
WHEN HE SHOWED UP
AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR,

28:06.956 --> 28:09.959
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME
ANSWER IT.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.461
WE JUST...
SAT THERE AND ATE

28:12.461 --> 28:16.966
WHILE HE KNOCKED
AND... KNOCKED.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.370
FINALLY, IT STOPPED.

28:21.370 --> 28:27.076
YOUR MOTHER SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY UNHAPPY WOMAN.

28:27.076 --> 28:31.480
I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
SO MUCH WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.845
BUT NOW I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE JUST HOW...

28:35.845 --> 28:38.247
DAMAGED SHE IS.

28:38.247 --> 28:40.920
IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER
INTRODUCED US?

28:40.920 --> 28:45.855
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT YOU TWO
WOULD HAVE MUCH IN COMMON.

28:45.855 --> 28:50.199
I CAN THINK OF ONE THING.

28:50.199 --> 28:53.332
WE BOTH LOVE YOU.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.503
(kisses)

28:56.806 --> 28:59.809
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S GOOD
I WAITED THIS LONG

28:59.809 --> 29:01.811
TO HAVE A REAL THANKSGIVING.

29:01.811 --> 29:04.113
WHY'S THAT?

29:04.113 --> 29:07.977
BECAUSE NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

29:07.977 --> 29:09.148
(chuckles)

29:13.823 --> 29:15.124
HEY, GUYS. (chuckles)

29:15.124 --> 29:17.226
I BROUGHT YOU SOME TURKEY.

29:17.226 --> 29:18.788
CAN I HAVE SOME?

29:18.788 --> 29:20.790
WELL, SURE,
BUT... WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

29:20.790 --> 29:22.962
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE
THROWING THE FOOTBALL AROUND.

29:22.962 --> 29:27.136
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE SHE
KICKED IT DOWN TO YOUR HOUSE.

29:27.136 --> 29:29.268
AND HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?

29:29.268 --> 29:32.471
A WHILE AGO,
BEFORE THE BABY STOPPED CRYING.

29:36.145 --> 29:39.478
(man) AND 1:35 LEFT HERE
IN THE 2nd.

29:39.478 --> 29:43.282
...AT THEIR OWN 42-YARD LINE,
TRAILING 21 TO 3.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.385
(man continues indistinctly)

29:50.359 --> 29:52.161
HEY, GUYS, HOW'S IT GOIN'?

29:52.161 --> 29:54.063
UH, DALLAS IS LOSING.

29:54.063 --> 29:55.564
WHERE'S THE BABY?

29:55.564 --> 29:57.927
THEY HAVE NO PASSING GAME.
 GUYS!

29:57.927 --> 30:02.101
(thud)
 SUSAN?

30:10.179 --> 30:13.983
(man speaking indistinctly,
whistle blows)

30:16.946 --> 30:21.120
(loudly) AHH. (chuckles) WELL,
NOW I'M NOT SUSPICIOUS AT ALL.

30:23.052 --> 30:24.994
COME ON, SUSAN!

30:24.994 --> 30:27.556
(shoes clomp)

30:29.458 --> 30:31.901
AAH! OH! (panting)

30:31.901 --> 30:33.432
GOD, YOU SCARED ME.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.966
YOU... STAY RIGHT THERE.
GUYS?

30:36.966 --> 30:38.337
HEY. (makes clicking sound)

30:38.337 --> 30:40.069
(click, TV turns off)

30:40.069 --> 30:42.211
WILL YOU WATCH THE GAME
UPSTAIRS?

30:42.211 --> 30:44.143
I NEED TO TALK TO SUSAN.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.475
WHEN DID SUSAN GET HERE?
 BEATS ME.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.577
(footsteps retreat)

30:48.577 --> 30:50.079
WHAT THE HELL?

30:50.079 --> 30:52.381
I COULD HEAR HER CRYING
FOUR HOUSES AWAY.

30:52.381 --> 30:55.084
YES. AND LAST NIGHT,
SHE CRIED JUST AS LOUD,

30:55.084 --> 30:58.087
BUT TWO MINUTES LATER,
SHE PUT HERSELF TO SLEEP.

30:58.087 --> 31:00.960
SHE WAS SELF-SOOTHING.
THE SYSTEM WAS WORKING.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.063
I DON'T CARE. I THINK IT'S
A CRAPPY SYSTEM FOR LAZY MOMS.

31:04.063 --> 31:08.097
(gasps) LAZY MOMS?
WHO ARE YOU TO TALK?

31:08.097 --> 31:10.940
YOU HAVE ONE KID
EVERY... 18 YEARS.

31:10.940 --> 31:13.973
ME--I'VE GOT FIVE IN THE HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.176
IT'S A WAR. SO IF I NEED
TO PUT MY BABY ON A SCHEDULE

31:17.176 --> 31:19.878
TO STOP MY LIFE
FROM SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL,

31:19.878 --> 31:21.880
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

31:21.880 --> 31:26.015
WELL... (sighs) YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO IT ALONE,

31:26.015 --> 31:28.017
'CAUSE I QUIT.

31:28.017 --> 31:31.190
WHOA. HOLD ON.
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE EXTREME?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.891
(sighs) LYNETTE, I'M SORRY.

31:32.891 --> 31:37.066
I CANNOT STAND BY AND LISTEN
TO THAT BABY CRY.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.928
EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES?

31:38.928 --> 31:42.271
EVEN FOR ONE MINUTE.
IT'S MORE THAN I CAN HANDLE.

31:42.271 --> 31:44.903
I LISTEN TO M.J.
CRYING HIMSELF TO SLEEP

31:44.903 --> 31:48.537
EVERY NIGHT... (voice breaking)
BECAUSE HE MISSES HIS DAD.

31:48.537 --> 31:53.412
I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
BECAUSE MY KID IS CRYING.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.987
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH CRYING
IN MY LIFE. I CAN'T TAKE IT.

31:57.987 --> 32:02.921
OH, SWEETIE. SHH.
I'M SO SORRY.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.493
I HAD NO IDEA.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.926
I'M SORRY TO DUMP
ALL THIS ON YOU.

32:07.926 --> 32:11.160
I HAVE BEEN EMOTIONAL
ALL DAY. (sobs)

32:12.962 --> 32:15.004
GOD... (sniffles)

32:15.004 --> 32:16.305
IT'S THANKSGIVING,
AND I...

32:16.305 --> 32:19.108
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
TO SPEAK TO MIKE.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.973
YOU WANNA CALL HIM?
YOU CAN USE MY PHONE.

32:23.973 --> 32:26.145
TALK AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.717
ARE YOU SURE? IT...
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

32:28.717 --> 32:32.451
WELL... IT'S EITHER
TALKING TO YOUR HUSBAND

32:32.451 --> 32:33.952
OR SELF-SOOTHING,

32:33.952 --> 32:36.455
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THAT.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.058
(both chuckle)

32:43.032 --> 32:45.164
(grunts)

32:45.164 --> 32:47.666
OH! THANK GOD
YOU HAVEN'T LEFT.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.638
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:49.638 --> 32:51.640
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.542
CARLOS AND I HIRED
OUR FRIEND BOB.

32:53.542 --> 32:56.645
HE'S A LAWYER.
HE'LL FIND A WAY TO HELP YOU.
 HOW? WE'RE BREAKING THE LAW.

32:56.645 --> 33:00.249
WELL, AT LEAST TALK TO HIM.
YOU CAN'T JUST PACK UP AND GO.

33:00.249 --> 33:03.252
WE ALWAYS KNEW THIS DAY
MIGHT COME. THIS WAS THE PLAN.

33:03.252 --> 33:06.015
I'M STICKING TO IT.

33:07.756 --> 33:12.191
CARMEN,
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS.
 (door closes)

33:12.191 --> 33:14.063
HI, GABY.

33:14.063 --> 33:17.066
MAMA, AM I SUPPOSED TO PACK
ALL MY CLOTHES AND BOOKS?

33:17.066 --> 33:22.371
UH, JUST YOUR FAVORITE THINGS,
 MIJA, FOR A NICE, LONG VISIT.

33:22.371 --> 33:24.533
I'M GOING TO MEET
MY COUSINS.

33:24.533 --> 33:26.675
(sighs) I HEARD.

33:26.675 --> 33:28.737
(chuckles)

33:31.710 --> 33:34.243
LOOK, CARMEN, I KNOW
YOU'RE A PROUD WOMAN,

33:34.243 --> 33:36.245
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET US
HELP YOU.

33:36.245 --> 33:38.717
WE'RE FAMILY. I'M AFRAID
IF I LET YOU GO,

33:38.717 --> 33:40.719
I'LL NEVER SEE GRACE AGAIN.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.253
AND YOU MIGHT NOT
SEE JUANITA.

33:46.755 --> 33:49.258
STAY WITH US UNTIL
WE CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT.

33:49.258 --> 33:53.332
THEY'LL NEVER LOOK
FOR YOU THERE.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.033
AT THE VERY LEAST,

33:55.033 --> 33:58.137
WE CAN HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS
WITH THE GIRLS.

34:00.709 --> 34:03.072
PLEASE.

34:03.072 --> 34:05.414
I'M NOT READY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE YET.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.123
(sobbing)

34:24.693 --> 34:28.197
TOP YOU OFF?
 THANKS. I'M GOOD.

34:39.648 --> 34:43.212
WHERE THE HECK
DID LYNETTE GO?

34:43.212 --> 34:45.214
SHE CAN'T BE THAT FAR.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.391
SO THE HOUSE LOOKS GREAT.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.223
THANKS.

34:54.223 --> 34:55.694
YOU LIKE LIVING HERE?

34:55.694 --> 35:00.199
UH, YEAH. SURE.

35:00.199 --> 35:04.673
(chuckles) THAT DIDN'T
SOUND VERY CONVINCING.

35:04.673 --> 35:07.176
WELL, IT'S NOTHING
AGAINST FAIRVIEW.

35:07.176 --> 35:10.879
IT'S JUST... I'M SURROUNDED
BY COUPLES AND MARRIED PEOPLE.

35:10.879 --> 35:13.642
AND I'M ALONE.

35:13.642 --> 35:17.516
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

35:17.516 --> 35:22.521
WELL, IF I KNOW YOU,
THAT'S NOT GONNA LAST.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.593
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW.

35:24.593 --> 35:27.596
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE USED TO SAY
I WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

35:27.596 --> 35:31.360
NOW THEY SAY I'M
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FOR MY AGE.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.202
PLEASE.

35:33.202 --> 35:35.534
I JUST SAW YOU IN A TOWEL.

35:37.666 --> 35:39.668
DID YOU GET
YOUR PREMIUM CHANNELS?

35:39.668 --> 35:41.840
I DID...

35:41.840 --> 35:44.843
AND HIGH-SPEED INTERNET.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.345
(chuckles)
THERE YOU GO.

35:46.345 --> 35:47.446
(clink)

35:47.446 --> 35:48.717
(both chuckle)

35:48.717 --> 35:51.780
MMM.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.782
OH, YOU KNOW,
THERE WAS A TIME

35:53.782 --> 35:56.685
WHERE I COULD HAVE
ANY MAN I WANTED,

35:56.685 --> 36:00.389
AND... I DID.

36:02.231 --> 36:04.333
BUT I DID NOT CHOOSE WISELY.

36:04.333 --> 36:08.166
I WENT FOR THE RICH GUYS,
THE FAMOUS GUYS,

36:08.166 --> 36:10.699
THE ONES WHO BOUGHT ME
PRETTY THINGS.

36:10.699 --> 36:16.205
I SHOULD'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
A MAN WHO WAS KIND AND GENTLE,

36:16.205 --> 36:21.810
THE KIND OF MAN YOU'D ACTUALLY
WANNA RAISE A FAMILY WITH.

36:25.814 --> 36:29.658
I GOTTA HAND IT TO LYNETTE.
SHE SURE KNOWS HOW TO PICK 'EM.

36:29.658 --> 36:33.662
(door opens and closes)

36:33.662 --> 36:38.427
OHH. (sighs)

36:38.427 --> 36:40.969
HMM. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

36:40.969 --> 36:43.372
WELL...

36:43.372 --> 36:45.674
YOU, ACTUALLY.

36:45.674 --> 36:47.706
I HOPE
IT WAS COMPLIMENTARY.

36:47.706 --> 36:52.210
UH, VERY.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.982
(chuckles)

36:53.982 --> 36:55.384
(knock)

36:57.386 --> 36:59.718
HEY.
 COME ON IN.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.220
MY DAD'S HERE.
HE'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.723
(door closes)
 OH. HOW'S HE DOING?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.756
(sighs) WEIRDLY OKAY.

37:07.756 --> 37:10.359
AND HOW ABOUT YOU?

37:10.359 --> 37:12.661
FREAKED OUT.

37:12.661 --> 37:15.334
(clears throat)

37:15.334 --> 37:17.636
GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE 4 OR 34

37:17.636 --> 37:19.868
WHEN YOUR MOM AND DAD
AREN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE.

37:19.868 --> 37:23.472
IT'S HORRIBLE, I KNOW.

37:23.472 --> 37:24.773
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IRONIC?

37:24.773 --> 37:26.475
THANKSGIVING,
BIG FAMILY HOLIDAY.

37:26.475 --> 37:28.477
THAT'S THE DAY
I START THINKING

37:28.477 --> 37:30.779
THERE'S NO POINT
IN BEING MARRIED.

37:30.779 --> 37:33.382
YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT.
 WHY NOT?

37:33.382 --> 37:35.384
THEY WERE MARRIED
FOR 35 YEARS.

37:35.384 --> 37:38.587
IF IT COULD FALL APART
THAT QUICKLY...

37:38.587 --> 37:40.559
IT DIDN'T.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.731
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING,
KEITH.

37:42.731 --> 37:44.693
YOU JUST HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND
TO SEE IT.

37:44.693 --> 37:47.035
HMM. LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE IT EASIER.

37:47.035 --> 37:52.771
SON, ALL I'M SAYING IS TRY NOT
TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT MARRIAGE.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.844
REALLY? 'CAUSE I SEE A LOT
OF DIVORCED PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.479
SORRY.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.481
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M DIVORCED.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.613
BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP
ON MARRIAGE.

38:04.613 --> 38:08.357
BECAUSE WHEN IT WORKS,
IT'S GREAT.

38:08.357 --> 38:11.360
AND I STILL BELIEVE
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN FOR ME.

38:12.621 --> 38:15.624
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE I JUST
SAID THAT TO MY BOYFRIEND

38:15.624 --> 38:17.666
IN FRONT OF HIS FATHER.

38:17.666 --> 38:19.368
(sighs)

38:20.969 --> 38:23.672
YOU WANNA TAKE A WALK?

38:23.672 --> 38:26.605
MAYBE I CAN SALVAGE
ONE NICE THANKSGIVING MEMORY

38:26.605 --> 38:27.906
OUT OF THIS DAY?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.038
I'D LOVE TO.

38:30.038 --> 38:32.341
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET MY COAT.

38:38.647 --> 38:40.649
I HOPE
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

38:40.649 --> 38:42.651
WELL, IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME,

38:42.651 --> 38:45.624
BUT I PROMISE
I'LL HELP HIM THROUGH IT.

38:45.624 --> 38:48.397
KEITH'S A LUCKY GUY
TO HAVE YOU.

38:48.397 --> 38:49.898
THANK YOU.

38:49.898 --> 38:56.034
I KNEW YOU WERE SPECIAL
FROM THE MOMENT I MET YOU.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.867
(footsteps approach)

38:58.867 --> 39:01.339
YOU READY TO GO?

39:01.339 --> 39:02.611
ALL SET.

39:04.673 --> 39:07.776
(door closes)

39:17.055 --> 39:19.758
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.960
NOTHING.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.433
HE STILL INSISTS
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

39:24.433 --> 39:25.734
CLEARLY, IT'S TOO SOON.

39:25.734 --> 39:29.668
YOU HAVEN'T GAINED
HIS TRUST YET.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.773
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

39:34.773 --> 39:37.145
JOIN SOME
WINE-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB.

39:37.145 --> 39:39.608
START GETTING HIM DRUNK
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

39:39.608 --> 39:41.880
MAYBE HE'LL LET
SOMETHING SLIP.

39:43.552 --> 39:45.454
WHAT'S WRONG?

39:47.616 --> 39:50.088
MAMA...

39:50.088 --> 39:53.622
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
THE POSSIBILITY THAT...

39:53.622 --> 39:54.593
THAT WHAT?

39:54.593 --> 39:58.026
THAT PAUL DIDN'T KILL
AUNT MARTHA.

39:58.026 --> 40:00.929
NO.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.703
HAVE YOU?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.775
WELL...

40:06.775 --> 40:09.177
NO ONE ACTUALLY
SAW HIM DO IT.

40:09.177 --> 40:11.109
OH, MY GOD.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.512
HE SWEARS
HE DIDN'T KILL HER.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.913
AND YOU BELIEVE HIM.

40:17.686 --> 40:20.519
I WANT YOU
OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

40:20.519 --> 40:23.892
MAMA.
 YOU WILL LEAVE HERE,
GET YOUR THINGS,

40:23.892 --> 40:25.894
AND GET OUT
OF THAT HOUSE TODAY.

40:25.894 --> 40:27.526
I CAN'T.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.597
WHY NOT?

40:28.597 --> 40:31.530
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.701
WHAT?

40:32.701 --> 40:34.663
HE'S NICE TO ME.

40:34.663 --> 40:36.465
WHO CARES?!

40:37.666 --> 40:39.608
HE'S A COLD-BLOODED KILLER!

40:39.608 --> 40:41.069
MAMA, THE GUARDS.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.441
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU
TO BE THIS STUPID!

40:43.441 --> 40:44.943
SIT DOWN,

40:44.943 --> 40:47.746
OR YOUR VISIT'S OVER.
 DON'T TOUCH ME!

40:47.746 --> 40:51.019
MAMA!
 I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU

40:51.019 --> 40:53.482
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A MONSTER!

40:53.482 --> 40:57.556
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

40:57.556 --> 40:59.888
BETH!

41:03.031 --> 41:04.733
MOM, WE WANT BREAKFAST.

41:04.733 --> 41:06.735
OKAY, I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.868
BOB, THERE HAS GOT TO BE
SOME WAY

41:09.868 --> 41:11.870
WE CAN GET HECTOR HIS PAPERS.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.603
ISN'T THERE SOMEBODY
THAT WE CAN THROW MONEY AT?

41:14.603 --> 41:18.747
GUYS, IT'S TOO LATE FOR HECTOR,
AND AS LONG AS CARMEN IS HERE,

41:18.747 --> 41:21.079
SHE RUNS THE RISK
OF BEING DEPORTED, TOO.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.582
SHE EITHER TURNS HERSELF IN,
OR...

41:23.582 --> 41:25.954
I HAVE TO DISAPPEAR.

41:27.716 --> 41:30.218
YOU SAID CARMEN'S AT RISK.
WHAT ABOUT GRACE?

41:30.218 --> 41:33.191
SHE WAS BORN HERE.
SHE'S AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.724
OH.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.898
(Juanita) MOM!

41:39.898 --> 41:41.730
I SHOULD GO.

41:46.575 --> 41:50.078
WOW. THIS IS GREAT.
WAFFLES ARE MY FAVORITE.

41:50.078 --> 41:53.081
GOOD. YOU CAN HAVE THEM
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

41:53.081 --> 41:57.285
REALLY? WOW. I WISH
I COULD LIVE HERE ALL THE TIME.

41:59.588 --> 42:01.089
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

42:01.089 --> 42:04.092
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY
WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

42:09.257 --> 42:10.759
ONCE A YEAR,

42:10.759 --> 42:15.934
WE REMEMBER TO STOP
AND COUNT OUR BLESSINGS.

42:15.934 --> 42:20.108
WE GIVE THANKS FOR THE FRIENDS
WHO UNDERSTAND US...

42:22.571 --> 42:25.574
THE LOVERS
WHO MAKES US HAPPY...

42:27.716 --> 42:31.219
THE CHILDREN
WHO DO OUR BIDDING...

42:33.722 --> 42:39.588
YES, WE MUST ALWAYS BE THANKFUL
FOR WHAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN...

42:39.588 --> 42:44.593
EVEN IF
IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY.
