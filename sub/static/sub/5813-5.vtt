00:03.086 --> 00:04.963
Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.210
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.909
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.392
The camera caught a ghost on film.
Spirit photography.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.853
How do you think
angry spirits are born?

00:14.890 --> 00:18.611
They can't let go and they can't move on
and they stay here for years.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.488
They all feel disembodied, scared.

00:21.813 --> 00:22.893
Talking about ghosts.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.408
No!

00:25.567 --> 00:27.035
The Darkness. She saved me.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.822
- We're bound, Dean.
- She thanked me.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.782
- For what?
- Setting her free.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.749
I think Amara is The Darkness.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.334
The Devil's in that girl.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.795
Amara's hungry.
She's a growing girl.

00:40.958 --> 00:44.087
So, we have some ancient evil out
there just getting stronger by the day.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.379
I want that child.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.672
I'm hungry.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.556
The child eats souls.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.762
I'm hungry.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.468
Amara?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.522
I said I'm hungry.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.491
This place is way creepier in person.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.289
Hell yeah, it is.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.206
Ghostfacers can't capture the rage vibes.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.794
You think we'll see anything?

01:21.957 --> 01:23.129
You know why I got this room?

01:23.959 --> 01:27.680
It's supposed to get
the heavy paranormal action.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.017
And now we're in The Shining.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.434
Crap.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.039
Ooh, she's coming to get you.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.453
Shut up.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.293
Don't worry. I'm here.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.965
It's what we came here for, right?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.950
The hinges are falling.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.162
What?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.669
Help! Help!

02:45.749 --> 02:46.750
Help!

03:07.229 --> 03:08.321
Yo.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.949
Don't suppose you got a 20
on The Darkness?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.446
Uh, well, I thought
I had something earlier.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.158
Half a town flipped their gourds
and started attacking people,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.574
but turns out they'd eaten
rabid possum meat.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.622
Okay, they do realize
that possum is giant rat, right?

03:21.910 --> 03:23.082
It's a marsupial.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.454
Huh?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.468
Not the point. Look, check this out. Um...

03:26.790 --> 03:29.669
A couple was ax-murdered
in Fall River, Massachusetts at,

03:29.835 --> 03:31.007
wait for it,

03:31.169 --> 03:33.422
the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast Museum.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.556
- A B&B and a museum?
- Yeah.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.516
That doesn't sound
like a tourist trap at all.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.643
I mean, the thing is the inn was
Lizzie Borden's actual house.

03:41.805 --> 03:45.230
In 1892, she hacked up her dad
and stepmom there.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.769
Or allegedly hacked them up.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.404
She was acquitted, ended up spending
the rest of her days in Fall River

03:49.563 --> 03:51.816
hounded and persecuted by the townspeople.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.326
So you're thinking revenge killing?
Why now?

03:55.193 --> 03:57.867
It was probably just some psycho fan
who's seen too many slasher flicks.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.532
Could be. But the inn was locked up.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.122
No signs of entry or exit,
a half a dozen guests,

04:03.285 --> 04:05.083
none of whom saw or heard any intruders.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.585
Well, maybe the murderer
was actually competent.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.877
Wait a minute, I know what this is.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.515
This has something to do with
your freaky fetish for serial killers.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.476
- It's not a fetish.
- You've always wanted to see that house.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.346
Dean, two people are dead.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.355
In Lizzie Borden's home.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.101
We got no leads on Amara,
I say we check this out.

04:28.810 --> 04:33.361
Besides, the entire Borden clan are
buried in Fall River, including Lizzie.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.534
What do you wanna do about Cass?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.036
Oh, he's knee-deep
in binge-watching The Wire.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.538
Just started season two.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.995
Yeah, he's not coming out any time soon.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.538
All right.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.766
Borden B&B, how may I help you?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.890
So I guess now Lizzie Borden
has her own doll.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.351
Yeah, went a little overboard
on the crazy eyes.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.017
No, it's absolutely
not a crime scene anymore.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.904
Look, the room's been cleaned
and you're not even on the same floor.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.564
There's no reason to canc...

05:16.900 --> 05:18.780
People still freaked out
about the murders, huh?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.863
Some find it exciting.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.281
Can I help you boys?

05:22.447 --> 05:24.199
Yeah, we read about the tragedy

05:24.366 --> 05:26.334
and I'm a bit of a history buff,

05:26.493 --> 05:27.915
and I just wanted to ask...

05:28.078 --> 05:30.297
Do you think the killings
had anything to do with Lizzie Borden?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.082
I mean, her ghost or whatever.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.801
Probably just some crazed fan
broke in, right?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.629
These are great questions, guys.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.468
Ones we usually answer
for our paying guests.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.758
Right.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.016
Mason!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.698
You forgot to cancel the bakery order.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.764
Mom, I'm with customers.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.650
Two hundred dollars' worth of Danish
and no guests to eat it.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.608
- These guys can put away a few.
- It's coming out of your paycheck.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.781
Of course it is.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.117
Working with family can be tough.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.911
Twenty years.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.956
And you have your pick of rooms.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.833
We'll take the one the couple was in.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.369
- The deceased couple?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.836
We came a long way to see some ghosts.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.623
We figure there's the most unrest there.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.133
Uh, we're not renting that room right now.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.509
Out of respect.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.927
But you gotta get back
on that horse sometime.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.187
Lucky. We redid the room.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.517
Great.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.478
And now that we're paying guests,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.393
did you hear or see
anything unusual that night?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.321
Not until we heard the screams.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.942
I told Mom to stay downstairs
and I ran up there.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.655
Oh, God! Blood.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.574
And who was the couple?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.738
Local kids.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.741
I mean, nothing special about the girl,
but the guy...

06:47.908 --> 06:49.876
He was a descendant
of the original Bordens.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.465
Hmm. Thanks.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.592
I don't know where to put my eyes.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.312
I think I'm gonna throw up.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.219
We're surrounded by doilies.
They're everywhere.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.347
Okay, you think the innkeeper might
have mentioned this

07:10.513 --> 07:11.765
before he ripped us off.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.933
Ugh.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.856
I guess, you're gonna have to get yourself
another room.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.862
Because this was Lizzie's original room
and I'm not giving it up.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.147
What are you, four?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.556
Look at that.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.193
That jibes with what people online
have been saying about the upstairs.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.534
Crying in empty rooms, footsteps,
buzzing lights.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.126
Hmm.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.468
No secret panels or passageways
in the closet.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.383
Well, the world's smallest bathroom
is clean.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.518
What is that smell?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.895
I think it's this. It's like a...

07:51.554 --> 07:52.897
Lavender toilet water.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.395
Bottled toilet water?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.442
Why do you keep spraying it?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.859
I just wanted to see
if the squeezy thing worked.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.323
I think it was supposed
to be a perfume or something.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.904
All right, I'm gonna go
check out the rest of the inn

08:04.234 --> 08:06.077
'cause now I got grandma all over me so...

10:12.153 --> 10:14.281
Hey! Hey!

10:14.405 --> 10:15.406
Oh!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.430
Yeah, no Lizzie in the attic.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.930
But I did find a homemade EMF generator.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.559
Turned that beast off
and what do you know, no more signal.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.103
Shocking. The, uh, flickering lights?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.444
Wired to timers buried in the walls.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.608
Come on.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.949
Oh. And check out this baby.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.868
Huh?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.334
Covering up our very own sound system.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.004
I, uh, fished this out of the wall.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.304
Crying in empty rooms.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.680
And there's more.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.343
Running footsteps, uh,
creepy whispers you can't quite make out,

11:58.509 --> 12:01.183
one flushing toilet,
not quite sure what that's about.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.420
The whole place is a hoax, man.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.354
It's a tourist trap, just like I said.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.814
Yeah, but we still don't know
how that couple got axed.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.274
I mean, how did the killer get in and out?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.319
I don't know, why don't we Sherlock that
over a beer and a lobster roll, okay?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.112
I gotta get out of this doily coffin.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.041
Thanks.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.549
Detective Madsen? Agent Collins.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.423
You weren't Feds earlier.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.263
Well, uh, my partner and I were
undercover,

13:17.463 --> 13:18.931
investigating the original murders.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.220
Where the hell were you
when my mom was being...

13:24.554 --> 13:26.556
I'm so very sorry, Mr. Kemper. I...

13:28.599 --> 13:30.679
We're gonna find the son of a bitch
who's doing this.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.725
He had just finished locking up.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.754
No one was inside
but him and Mrs. Kemper.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.046
Staff went home hours ago.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.349
And no suspects
for the first murders either?

14:03.760 --> 14:04.761
Hi. I'm Agent Gabriel.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.930
Listen, I saw a guy hanging
around earlier,

14:07.180 --> 14:10.684
uh, snapping some photos and he ran
away when I tried to make contact.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.820
Let me guess... Short, chunky, baby-faced?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.355
Yeah, that's him.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.607
That's Len. Total teddy bear.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.014
I went to high school with him.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.162
Obsessed with ghosts but harmless.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.248
Ghosts?

14:26.407 --> 14:27.727
Is that a real issue around here?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.870
According to the Chamber of Commerce,
absolutely.

14:29.952 --> 14:30.953
Right.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.872
I'll send an officer over to Len,
get a statement from him.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.837
You know what, you guys got
your hands full,

14:35.124 --> 14:36.296
- we'll, uh, drop by.
Mmm-hmm.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.701
- Thanks.
- You betcha.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.225
Well, so far we got squat
that says ghost or anything remotely us.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.307
So maybe it's not our usual kind of gig.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.109
Maybe we're dealing with a serial killer.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.904
Oh, yeah, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

14:54.185 --> 14:56.358
- Agent Collins.
- This is Detective Madsen.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.605
There's been another victim.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.194
- Really?
- Axed in the next county.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.859
- God...
- I'm there now.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.616
- Thanks for letting me know.
- You're welcome.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.742
Another ax vic,
this one miles from the B&B.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.748
- Lizzie left home?
- Apparently.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.787
All right, I'll take the crime scene,
you take Len.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.763
Who found the body?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.846
Babysitter was home with the kid,
found dad in the driveway.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.009
Jeez.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.811
Thanks.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.692
I heard Jordie's dad pull up outside
and then there was this shout.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.989
I went to look and I saw the blood
before I saw him.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.525
I thought someone had spilled paint.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.028
And what about before?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.538
I mean, did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

15:47.822 --> 15:51.747
Uh, a sound? Smell?
There's no detail too small.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.620
No, it was like any other night.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.373
Mom!

15:57.540 --> 15:59.167
Jordie, are you all right?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.467
Did he see anything?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.549
No, he was inside the whole time.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.682
Ma'am, I'm Agent Collins with the FBI.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.060
I understand this is a terrible time,

16:13.222 --> 16:14.724
but if you can manage,
I would love to ask you a few...

16:14.891 --> 16:17.051
You need to get out of my house
is what you need to do.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.712
Of course, we can do this tomorrow.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.947
Get out!

16:36.412 --> 16:37.413
Wow.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.419
Didn't expect to see her here.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.755
Well, gotta live your bliss.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.258
You are a Lizzie Borden...

16:46.047 --> 16:47.674
I don't think "fan" covers it.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.888
Uh, super-fan.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.140
And curator.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.471
Mmm-hmm.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.191
And is that what you were doing tonight,
at the B&B?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.351
Curating?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.108
Oh. I, uh...

17:01.270 --> 17:03.523
Len, it's best just to go
with the truth here.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.617
I was trying to get
a picture of Lizzie's ghost.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.183
And is that what I saw you with?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.785
Yeah. It's, uh...

17:11.948 --> 17:15.794
It's what the Victorians used
for spirit photography.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.003
Mmm-hmm. And have you captured
any Caspers on that thing?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.290
Well, I've seen Lizzie at her house.

17:21.832 --> 17:25.962
She's this wispy, gray shadow,

17:26.127 --> 17:27.550
but she never shows up on film.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.466
Maybe I should go high-def.

17:31.801 --> 17:32.848
Why not go inside?

17:34.178 --> 17:36.852
I'm not exactly allowed
at the inn anymore.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.814
There's a minor restraining order.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.360
And there's a gag order
not to talk about the restraining order.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.196
But you're a federal agent.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.443
Buried the lead there a little, Len.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.570
Why don't you tell me
about the restraining order.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.411
It was Lizzie's 155th birthday.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.497
I couldn't get Lizzie's room, so...

17:57.159 --> 17:58.206
I stayed in the basement.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.871
For a couple days.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.584
Weeks. I wasn't bothering anybody.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.121
So it's safe to say
that you know the inn pretty well.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.508
Let me ask you, did anything about tonight
strike you as weird?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.139
Just you banging on the window.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.502
- Your chat room is open.
- Oh, God, no.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.526
I'm supposed to lead a live chat
about the ax murders in Fall River.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.730
I'm not Lizzie CNN!

18:23.394 --> 18:24.941
Yeah, I don't know why
anyone would think that.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.697
I'll close it down. Be right back.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.859
Okay.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.528
Four ax murders in two days, no leads.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.196
Whole town's panicking
like it's The Purge.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.363
Yeah, not the whole town.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.373
Mrs. Pinski doesn't seem too broken up
over the fact

18:36.532 --> 18:38.534
that her husband was butchered
in the driveway.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.499
You saw the body. She's in shock.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.706
Still.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.050
People have freaky-ass reactions to loss.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.192
Where did you see this?

19:11.525 --> 19:12.572
Uh...

19:12.860 --> 19:15.204
A site about ghosts.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.618
Uh, the paranormal.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.292
Len, you might be the worst liar
I've ever met.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.125
Tell me where you've seen this symbol.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.257
I can take you down to the station
to ask you there

19:26.415 --> 19:29.055
but then we gotta involve
the local police, your restraining order.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.420
Okay.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.672
Okay. Uh...

19:34.465 --> 19:37.765
I was outside Lizzie's house
a couple nights ago.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.434
Just trying to catch a picture of her.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.940
For a second I thought you were a...

19:47.770 --> 19:51.991
Never mind. Um, are you lost?
Or staying at the inn?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.825
I wish I were.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.489
I wanna see where Lizzie axed her folks.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.787
Oh. Well, uh, you were looking at it.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.419
Half of it.
That's where they found Andrew Borden,

20:03.577 --> 20:06.581
slumped over the couch
in the sitting room.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.589
I'm sorry, uh, how old are you?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.051
Poor Lizzie.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.218
I've been reading up on her.
Her parents sucked.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.470
I totally agree.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.851
Lizzie has been so misunderstood
by history.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.358
It's pretty obvious her uncle had
the stronger motive and opportunity.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.815
Oh, no, Lizzie definitely hacked them.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.697
You can see it in her eyes.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.858
Serial killer eyes.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.744
I ditched her quick after that.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.147
But you didn't tell the police?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.998
A, restraining order.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.000
B, what am I supposed to say?

20:47.163 --> 20:50.007
I was hanging out talking murder
with a 12-year-old girl

20:50.166 --> 20:51.246
in the middle of the night?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.676
Where does the symbol come in?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.595
She had it on her shoulder.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.345
I don't know if it was a scar
or a birthmark.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.428
- What did this girl look like?
- Um...

21:02.094 --> 21:04.438
A girl. Amara.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.687
That's what she said her name was.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.238
You know her.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.568
You said she was 12?

21:17.026 --> 21:19.779
Well, maybe a little younger or older.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.946
Who is she?

21:23.449 --> 21:24.826
She's a runaway.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.863
Do you know where Amara is now?
Is she still in town?

21:27.870 --> 21:30.089
I don't know. Why are you looking for her?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.624
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.883
You have to tell me.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.760
Please, I need to find her.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.387
Why?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.015
You won't believe me.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.223
Okay, well, uh, enjoy your Lizzie fest.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.897
Oh, hey, uh, no touching.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.268
I never touched you.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.426
I don't know what that girl
did to me,

22:15.584 --> 22:17.302
but I haven't been right since.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.098
I can't eat or sleep.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.096
I don't dream.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.936
And all the things I used to love,

22:26.095 --> 22:30.316
my Lizzie blog, the ghost conventions,
they leave me cold.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.144
I put this whole collection
on eBay last night.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.780
Now it belongs to some machinist in Ohio.

22:37.481 --> 22:41.782
What about super-fan, curator,
living the bliss?

22:42.444 --> 22:43.912
Just playing the part.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.288
Of what I used to be.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.751
You know, fake it till you make it.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.541
Or feel it.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.706
So is that what you were doing
at the inn tonight?

22:54.915 --> 22:56.167
- Faking it?
- No.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.211
I was looking for Amara.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.095
I want her to put me back.

23:01.589 --> 23:05.264
I've always been odd and quirky

23:06.302 --> 23:07.679
but I had a life.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.264
Friends.

23:09.430 --> 23:13.355
And now I remember how to talk to people,

23:14.310 --> 23:15.482
what to say...

23:16.854 --> 23:18.151
But I feel like I'm acting.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.154
Going through the motions.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.491
I'm like a robot puppet man.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.664
Wait, Amara was here? How?

23:32.369 --> 23:33.461
Oh, and the real crazy?

23:33.621 --> 23:35.123
Apparently she's like 12.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.753
What?

23:36.916 --> 23:37.963
How's that even possible?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.325
It ain't Wheaties she's eating,
I'll tell you that much.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.175
- Meaning?
- Len. He ain't doing so hot.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.258
I think Amara sucked out his soul.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.851
So, Amara's growing
like a radioactive weed?

23:55.017 --> 23:56.860
Yeah, by stuffing her face with souls.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.614
Does that mean she's gaining
more power, too? And for what?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.446
I don't know. That tsunami's gonna hit us
sooner or later,

24:02.691 --> 24:04.691
right now we gotta deal with
what we can deal with.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.988
All these spent shells
Amara's leaving behind.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.453
You don't think Len's our Lizzie Borden,
do you?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.458
No, I talked to his neighbors

24:11.617 --> 24:14.370
and except for me seeing him at the B&B,
he's been here all night.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.005
So, we can't kill him
'cause he hasn't done anything yet.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.841
Dean, we don't wanna kill him.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.628
We wanna save people, remember?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.721
Right, your new rules.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.502
Why hasn't he offed anybody?

24:27.591 --> 24:29.309
I mean, it took Jenna
all of walking downstairs

24:29.385 --> 24:30.477
to slit her grandmother's throat.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.229
Maybe not everybody
who gets their soul-sucked out

24:32.388 --> 24:33.389
turns into a killer.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.644
Or maybe he just hasn't
gotten around to it yet.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.040
All right, well, I think the best thing
is we just stick close

24:39.061 --> 24:40.358
until we figure out how to help him out

24:40.521 --> 24:43.570
which starts by you telling him
he's got no soul.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.447
- Me?
- Yeah.

24:45.776 --> 24:46.868
Why do I have to do it?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.912
Well, because you've been there,
you speak the language.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.493
He doesn't even know
he's been Hoovered yet.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.329
Yeah, but you have better relationship
with him than I do.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.664
Yeah, but you're better with that
whole sensitive, verbal massage.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.166
There's no sensitive way to tell him
his soul's been sucked out

24:57.287 --> 24:58.288
by a pre-historic tween.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.169
And even if Len does believe us,

25:00.541 --> 25:02.259
is that supposed to make him feel better?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.884
Fine. Probably couldn't
handle the truth anyway,

25:06.922 --> 25:08.424
he's a little fragile right now.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.718
Okay, well, great.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.103
Looks like we're babysitting
a 30-year-old man.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.435
There may be someone else
Amara got to as well.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.518
- Our hatchet man.
- Yeah.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.483
So, the murders started right around
the time Len saw Amara, right?

25:21.645 --> 25:24.444
Well, the wife of the last victim,
uh, Dawn Pinski,

25:24.606 --> 25:28.031
had this bizarre reaction
to hearing her husband got minced.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.445
I mean, like she couldn't care less.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.971
That's kind of the way I felt
the whole time I was soulless.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.832
Oh, yeah, you were one chilly droid.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.290
Anyways, detective thinks it's shock,

25:37.453 --> 25:40.423
but I think maybe Mom lost her soul
and picked up an ax.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.666
Hmm.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.268
- Hello?
- Sydney, this is Agent Collins.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.357
We're trying to find Mrs. Pinski,

26:02.519 --> 26:04.146
do you have any idea where she might be?

26:04.563 --> 26:07.988
Um, no, she, uh, didn't mention anything.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.878
Dawn didn't want me to come over today.

26:11.111 --> 26:14.581
Sydney, you are a part
of a federal murder investigation.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.034
You do not wanna hold
anything back from us.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.959
Okay, there might be one place
that she could be.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.503
Dawn has a friend, Nate.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.459
A special friend.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.038
Okay, I'm reading your mail.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.727
Look, I don't wanna get Dawn in trouble.

26:28.879 --> 26:29.926
Do you have an address?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.183
Kitten videos, chicken and waffles,
eucalyptus scent,

26:32.341 --> 26:33.388
don't care for it anymore.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.910
Used to swoon for dark curly hair.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.353
Now? Not so much.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.604
You think I had a stroke?

26:37.763 --> 26:39.106
Or maybe it's a brain tumor.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.647
What's really freaky is all the stuff
that used to make my skin crawl,

26:42.810 --> 26:43.811
HOW seems...

26:44.269 --> 26:45.270
Eh...

26:45.521 --> 26:47.023
I couldn't shake a guy's hand before.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.691
God, that wetness.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.697
Now, I could lick the sweat
off a stranger's...

26:50.859 --> 26:53.282
- Okay.
- Yeah, any body part, I'm serious.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.952
I feel weird, man.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.163
"Weird" how?

26:58.534 --> 27:01.708
Like somethings hatching inside of me.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.455
Something dark.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.041
With wings.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.379
- What?
- Nothing.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.593
You looked at Sam like...

27:11.755 --> 27:13.507
You guys know what's wrong with me.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.642
Hey.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.561
You don't have a soul, all right?

27:17.719 --> 27:18.720
Amara sucked it out.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.015
- What...
- Dean.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.149
You wanna be a little more blunt?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.231
How is that even possible?

27:25.727 --> 27:27.400
Look, this is just so you don't
get in trouble, all right?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.611
We'll be right back and then
we'll figure out what to do.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.241
Well, how do I get it back?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.617
My soul.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.948
Generally, you don't.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.035
It feels good to finally know.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.639
Hello.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.523
Something happened in here.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.519
Well, the blue car is the mom's.
I saw it last night.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.767
Jordie.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.556
Hey, buddy.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.898
You all right? Give me a sec.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.832
Oh, thank God.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.248
I thought you were dead.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.553
I can't believe
that I bagged both of you guys.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.930
Yeah, so it's, uh, Sydney,
the killer babysitter.

30:41.965 --> 30:42.966
Not the mom.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.015
So what's the story?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.930
You gonna hack us up like the others?

30:48.430 --> 30:49.682
I'm past that.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.143
You two are an offering to my new friend.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.027
Let me guess.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.527
Is your new bestie Amara?

30:58.774 --> 30:59.821
You know her?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.281
Yeah, we're tight.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.450
How did you two meet?

31:07.282 --> 31:09.205
Couple nights ago, I got pretty sloshed.

31:10.952 --> 31:15.583
This, uh, smug, little trust-fund dirtbag
had just dumped me.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.051
Excuse me, drunk girl?

31:19.669 --> 31:20.966
You shouldn't be driving.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.011
You could put your head through a window.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.013
Where are your parents?

31:30.597 --> 31:32.557
Did they bring you to this dump
on a school night?

31:33.850 --> 31:35.352
My parents used to do that.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.817
I found this place on my own.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.111
I like dark places.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.152
You're here alone?

31:45.821 --> 31:47.789
Okay, let's, uh...

31:49.699 --> 31:51.042
Let's get you inside.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.671
I'm Sydney, by the way.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.753
I'm going to help you, Sydney.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.003
You think I need help?

32:04.798 --> 32:06.800
Well, maybe you're right.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.554
Tonight, anyway.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.119
How did you...

32:28.155 --> 32:29.702
How did you do that?

32:30.657 --> 32:32.034
Oh, I feel like...

32:33.076 --> 32:36.205
I feel like ecstasy, orgasm,
chocolate cake.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.790
You're an angel.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.336
Do I look like a whiny, winged suck-up?

32:46.423 --> 32:47.970
Well, then what are you?

33:08.570 --> 33:12.245
Have you guys ever seen
the iced tea commercial

33:12.616 --> 33:14.459
where the lady is lying
on the inflatable raft

33:14.618 --> 33:17.747
and she's just drifting along
a sparkling pool?

33:18.747 --> 33:19.964
That's what it was like.

33:20.582 --> 33:21.799
Being with Amara.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.169
Bliss.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.179
No hurting,

33:26.338 --> 33:27.931
no sadness,

33:28.173 --> 33:29.425
no memories.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.434
So you don't want memories?

33:35.305 --> 33:38.275
Did you have nice parents, Sam?

33:40.310 --> 33:45.316
Because my folks treated me
and my sister like human ashtrays.

33:46.483 --> 33:49.703
I used to have to drink myself blind
to even look at these,

33:50.695 --> 33:52.197
let alone show anybody.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.333
And now, I don't know
what Amara did to me,

33:55.492 --> 33:56.664
but it's just skin.

33:59.162 --> 34:01.631
Right, well, that's really good for you.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.339
No more waking up screaming
from nightmares,

34:04.501 --> 34:06.094
no more flashbacks.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.135
Amara took away the pain.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.559
She lightened something in me.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.228
Except now you're an ax-murderer.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.398
I'm free.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.980
Before, there was always
this constant voice in my head,

34:25.438 --> 34:27.638
"You can't do that, it's wrong.
What if you get caught?"

34:27.774 --> 34:30.243
And now it is quiet.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.996
It is just me and what I want.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.168
And when you can do whatever you want,
you don't have to get caught.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.079
And then you can really fly.

34:41.663 --> 34:44.132
Were you flying when you diced up
that couple at the inn?

34:46.167 --> 34:48.716
When I found out that that pus-hole

34:48.878 --> 34:50.926
was taking another girl to the B&B...

34:51.089 --> 34:53.467
That's his deal-closing move...

34:54.676 --> 34:56.476
I didn't have to sit at home
and cry about it.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.347
And what about the innkeeper's mom?

34:58.513 --> 35:01.016
That piece of jerky,
she screwed me out of two weeks' pay.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.105
I used to fantasize about killing her
and now I am living the dream.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.458
So that's how you got in and out.

35:08.690 --> 35:09.737
You worked there.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.367
Just for one summer.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.473
What about Jordie's parents, huh?

35:14.529 --> 35:15.929
What, did they screw you over, too?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.039
Not me.

35:17.866 --> 35:18.867
Jordie.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.998
Where to start?

35:21.911 --> 35:25.131
Meth-dealing dad, slut mom.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.418
No, I saved Jordie.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.887
And I'm gonna take better care of him
than they ever did.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.223
Well, you said that we were, uh...

35:34.382 --> 35:35.725
We were an offering.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.803
Well, how are you planning on
bringing Amara here?

35:38.845 --> 35:40.563
Don't tell me that girl's got
a cell phone.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.190
I've been praying.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.732
And I know that she can hear me.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.233
I can feel it.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.695
She's close.

35:52.859 --> 35:53.906
She hasn't left me.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.070
Well, bring her on out.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.326
We've been hunting that bitch
for weeks.

35:57.739 --> 35:58.911
She is a goddess!

36:13.588 --> 36:14.760
Holy crap.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.800
I just did that.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.679
Hey. Hey.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.769
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take this away.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.521
The Darkness is coming.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.949
It's so peaceful.

36:35.068 --> 36:36.786
It's coming for all of us.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.350
Jordie, you have any, uh, family
you can stay with?

37:14.482 --> 37:19.488
When I was six months old,
my mom died and my dad was...

37:21.781 --> 37:23.249
Was never really around much.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.836
I realize that's nowhere close
to what you've lost

37:31.082 --> 37:32.550
but you're gonna survive this.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.173
People are gonna help you.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.348
There's Aunt Kathy.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.352
She comes at Christmas.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.699
First of all, I ripped my hand
out of the cuff.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.360
Well, you saved us, Len.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.369
Yeah, that's not why I mauled myself.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.698
I wanted to see if I could do it.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.167
It hurt like a mother,

38:06.701 --> 38:08.954
but it didn't wig me out at all.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.333
I picked up my thumb
like it was a mini hot dog.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.765
Len, I'm not gonna lie, that's worrisome.

38:15.877 --> 38:16.969
And that girl...

38:18.171 --> 38:19.969
My brain said I should help you,

38:20.131 --> 38:23.556
But I didn't really feel anything.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.345
For you or her.

38:26.805 --> 38:31.060
What kind of person can murder
and feel nothing?

38:34.020 --> 38:38.321
Len, whatever darkness you have
inside you,

38:39.901 --> 38:43.906
if there is a shred of conscience,
then there might be hope.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.912
No, Sam said once your soul is gone,

38:47.075 --> 38:48.292
you can't get it back.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.084
And I know for sure now.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.841
If I'm not stopped,
there'll be another kill.

38:57.877 --> 39:02.223
I can feel it, like a bubble rising up.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.889
So what do you wanna do?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.438
You could kill me.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.275
No, I can't, I...

39:14.519 --> 39:15.645
I don't wanna do that.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.319
Then there's only one thing.

39:21.568 --> 39:22.694
I'm gonna turn myself in.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.867
I'll confess to all the murders,
that way I can't get out.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.119
Hmm.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.083
Well, there's not too many

39:33.705 --> 39:35.878
soulless killers
that would give themselves up.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.136
I remember what it was like
to do the right thing.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.723
So I'm going through the motions.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.351
For as long as I can.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.813
Still can't believe Len turned
himself in.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.990
I mean, kinda makes sense.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.749
You know, people having
different reactions to losing their souls.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.819
I did.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.113
Everyone's got their own history, right?

40:08.448 --> 40:09.825
Len loses his heart,

40:09.991 --> 40:11.334
Sydney loses her head.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.372
What, are we looking
for the cowardly lion next?

40:18.833 --> 40:21.006
You know, I get this, like,
pit in my stomach,

40:21.169 --> 40:22.386
any time I think of her.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.006
The Darkness.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.344
Like we only know the tip
of what she is, what she does to people.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.390
You know, Len was freaked out by her
but Sydney...

40:33.556 --> 40:35.024
Sydney couldn't get enough.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.777
The bliss she was talking about, you know?

40:41.314 --> 40:42.486
What was it like for you?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.693
Did you feel like that with Amara?

40:45.985 --> 40:47.077
No.

40:47.695 --> 40:48.912
Oh, I mean, it was quiet.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.204
Yeah, until, uh...

40:52.367 --> 40:56.292
Until she started hatching killers
and rallying monsters to raise armies.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.766
So that's how we have to find her, huh?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.125
Follow the bodies?

41:01.542 --> 41:02.634
You got a better idea?

41:04.045 --> 41:05.805
We could follow
the crazy you've been seeing.

41:06.923 --> 41:10.894
Look at the rate Amara's growing,
sucking souls and getting stronger...

41:11.052 --> 41:12.520
She might not be that hard to find.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.222
Come on.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.254
Bye, Dean. I'll see you soon.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.123
English - SDH
