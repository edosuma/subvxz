WEBVTT

00:01.736 --> 00:03.204
April:
PREVIOUSLY ON
CHASING LIFE...

00:03.237 --> 00:05.306
I WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH DOMINIC.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

00:05.339 --> 00:08.509
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
IF I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:08.541 --> 00:09.710
-DO I?
-WHAT HAPPENED?

00:09.743 --> 00:12.779
ACCORDING TO HER,
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH APRIL.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.648
IT'S NOT TRUE, THOUGH,
AND IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
AVAILABLE, ANYWAY.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.550
-WE HAVE A MATCH.
-FINALLY!

00:17.585 --> 00:21.088
Sydney:
THE SICK KID, HIS NAME'S FINN.
HE HAS CANCER AND ONLY ONE LEG.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.390
-HI.
-NOT TO SPEAK ILL
OF THE DEAD,

00:22.422 --> 00:24.391
BUT THOMAS CARVER--
THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED,

00:24.425 --> 00:26.227
HE WAS
BLOWING MONEY, DRINKING.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.661
THE GUY HAD DEMONS
EVEN I FIND DARK.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.232
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW MY DAD.
I'M GONNA WRITE A BOOK.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.405
OH, WRITING MY BOOK WAS EASY.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.707
I STARED AT A BLINKING CURSOR
FOR SIX, SEVEN HOURS A NIGHT

00:39.740 --> 00:42.042
UNTIL I WAS CONVINCED
I WAS A TOTAL FRAUD,

00:42.076 --> 00:43.444
AND THEN I STARTED TYPING.

00:43.476 --> 00:46.146
WELL, I'VE GOT THE FEAR
AND INSECURITY PARTS
DOWN FOR SURE.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.716
WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ACTUALLY
START READING YOUR BOOK,
IT'S TERRIFYING...

00:48.749 --> 00:50.584
AND THRILLING.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.286
I'M SO EXCITED.

00:52.319 --> 00:56.090
WRITING A NOVEL IS
SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT
I COULD OR WOULD DO,

00:56.122 --> 00:58.292
KIND OF LIKE OWNING
YOUR OWN HOUSE.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.460
THAT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL!
I WANNA SEE IT!

01:00.493 --> 01:02.396
WELL, YOU CAN.
I'LL WARN YOU--
IT'S A DUMP,

01:02.429 --> 01:04.165
BUT I'LL MAKE
A HOME OUT OF IT...

01:04.198 --> 01:05.566
-(chuckles)
-...SOME DAY.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.168
SO, ANY THOUGHT
ON WHAT YOUR DEBUT
IS GONNA BE ABOUT?

01:08.201 --> 01:11.739
MMM, I HAVE THREE
OR FOUR IDEAS I'VE BEEN
KICKING AROUND FOR A WHILE.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.141
HONESTLY, I JUST--
WHATEVER I WRITE,

01:14.174 --> 01:16.644
I WANT IT TO HAVE A REAL SHOT
AT GETTING PUBLISHED.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.847
YOU KNOW, I COULD TALK
TO MY AGENT, NINA, ABOUT IT.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.615
YOU GUYS COULD
SIT DOWN, TALK ABOUT
THE PUBLISHING MARKET.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.486
REALLY? YOU THINK
SHE'D MEET WITH ME?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.420
-COME ON!
-(both laugh)

01:27.454 --> 01:30.290
THE SMART AND TALENTED DAUGHTER
OF A FAMOUS BEST-SELLING AUTHOR?

01:30.323 --> 01:31.859
-MMM.
-IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.329
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY IT,
I KIND OF BELIEVE IT A LITTLE.

01:36.362 --> 01:40.099
SERIOUSLY.
HEY, THANK YOU.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.603
IT'S NOTHING.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.240
YOU'RE A CATCH...

01:46.272 --> 01:49.343
-FOR A LITERARY AGENT.
-RIGHT.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.110
I KNOW SHE'S HEADING
BACK TO NEW YORK

01:51.145 --> 01:52.445
FOR PUBLISHER MEETINGS
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

01:52.479 --> 01:55.115
SO YOU SHOULD PLAN
ON MEETING MAYBE TOMORROW.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.685
YEAH, I CAN MAKE
MYSELF AVAILABLE.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.620
(chuckles)
COULD THIS DAY
GET ANY BETTER?

02:00.653 --> 02:04.825
APRIL CARVER, THERE ARE
BUT A FEW MAJOR MILESTONES

02:04.858 --> 02:08.628
IN EVER WOMAN'S LIFE
WHICH FOREVER SHAPE
AND DEFINE HER LEGACY,

02:08.662 --> 02:10.531
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,

02:10.563 --> 02:13.234
HAVE OFFICIALLY
COME UPON ONE OF YOURS.

02:13.266 --> 02:16.135
FOR THE TIME HAS
NOW COME TO PLAN...

02:16.170 --> 02:18.271
YOUR BACHELORETTE PARTY!

02:18.305 --> 02:22.175
-YES! YES!
-(both laugh)

02:22.209 --> 02:25.346
-(theme music playing)
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

02:25.378 --> 02:28.181
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

02:28.215 --> 02:32.920
♪ JUST RIGHT ♪

02:33.152 --> 02:38.292
♪ YOU COULD STAY ALL NIGHT
AND NEVER WANNA GO HOME ♪

02:38.324 --> 02:39.926
♪ 'CAUSE WE CAN'T STOP ♪

02:40.159 --> 02:41.628
♪ WE WON'T STOP. ♪

02:42.663 --> 02:43.697
I HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED

02:43.730 --> 02:44.865
ON THE WEDDING PART
OF THE WEDDING,

02:44.899 --> 02:46.800
THAT I TOTALLY FORGOT

02:46.834 --> 02:48.435
I GET A BACHELORETTE PARTY!

02:48.468 --> 02:50.271
WE BOTH DID. HOW DID WE FORGET
ABOUT A NIGHT

02:50.304 --> 02:51.938
FULL OF MALE STRIPPERS?

02:52.171 --> 02:54.375
OKAY, STRIPPERS ARE GREAT...

02:54.408 --> 02:56.610
-YEAH.
-...BUT-- WILD IDEA--

02:56.644 --> 02:58.378
WHAT IF WE DID

02:58.412 --> 03:00.580
SOMETHING THAT COULD INCLUDE
MY MOM AND GRANDMA.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.317
IT'S MY LAST WEEK AT HOME,
AND I JUST WANNA SHOW THEM

03:03.349 --> 03:04.717
THAT EVEN THOUGH
I'M MOVING OUT,

03:04.752 --> 03:06.554
THEY'RE STILL A HUGE PART
OF THIS NEXT PHASE OF MY LIFE.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.923
(scoffs) FINE.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.858
IF YOU WANT YOUR PARTY TO BE
MOM AND GRANDMA FRIENDLY,

03:10.890 --> 03:12.259
THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.962
WHAT ABOUT WE GO OUT FOR
A CLASSY WINE-TASTING

03:16.195 --> 03:17.631
AT SIP MAYBE,

03:17.664 --> 03:19.900
THEN HAVE A NICE DINNER OUT
AFTERWARDS?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.336
WHAT ABOUT BRENNA? SHE'LL BE
SO BUMMED TO BE LEFT OUT.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.503
OH NO,
I ALREADY TALKED TO HER.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.772
SHE TOTALLY GETS THAT
A BACHELORETTE PARTY

03:25.806 --> 03:27.373
THAT ISN'T 21-PLUS DOESN'T
REALLY COUNT,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.710
SO SHE'S SITTING THIS ONE OUT
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.513
SO, IT'S SETTLED.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.480
APRIL'S BACHELORETTE PARTY,

03:34.514 --> 03:36.516
A CLASSY AFFAIR.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.986
OH GOD. I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

03:40.219 --> 03:41.921
WITH ALL THESE NOVELTY
CAKE PANS NOW.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.692
OH MY. THIS IS...

03:45.692 --> 03:47.927
-GIRTHY.
-(giggles)

03:50.531 --> 03:54.668
(sighs) APRIL'S BACHELORETTE
PARTY IS TOMORROW NIGHT

03:54.701 --> 03:56.903
AND I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO GO, SO...

03:56.937 --> 03:59.539
SO I'M JUST GONNA BE
SITTING AT HOME, ALL NIGHT,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.609
ALL BY MYSELF.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.847
-I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
-I KNOW, RIGHT?

04:06.879 --> 04:09.015
A WHOLE NIGHT OFF
FROM APRIL'S WEDDING.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.352
I CAN JUST WATCH TV,
EAT JUNK FOOD,

04:11.384 --> 04:13.353
AND NOT HAVE TO WATCH
YOUTUBE VIDEOS

04:13.387 --> 04:14.687
THAT TEACH YOU
HOW TO CURL A RIBBON.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.557
-(both laugh)
-YO, I'M IN.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.292
SO, I'M GUESSING STILL
NO PUBLIC SCHOOL FRIENDS?

04:18.324 --> 04:20.728
NO, NOT YET. I MEAN, I TALKED
TO THIS ONE GUY,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.629
HE HAS LYMPHOMA.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.798
OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T
MAKE A NORMAL FRIEND.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.468
FINN IS NORMAL.
HE'S JUST SICK.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.935
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.338
HE HAS TO MAKE THIS MASK
ALL THE TIME.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.740
YOU SHOULD INVITE HIM OVER.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.475
I LOVE A MAN IN A MASK.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.343
WE'RE NOT EVEN
REAL FRIENDS YET,

04:37.377 --> 04:40.346
AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF THAT'S THE BEST IDEA.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.548
HOW COULD FINALLY MAKING
A FRIEND NOT BE THE BEST IDEA?

04:42.582 --> 04:44.851
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT FINN,

04:44.884 --> 04:47.487
I CAN'T HELP IT--
ALL I SEE IS CANCER.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.557
AND BECAUSE OF APRIL,
THERE'S THIS PART OF ME

04:50.591 --> 04:53.627
THAT FEELS LIKE I HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.362
BUT SCHOOL'S SUPPOSED
TO BE THE ONE PLACE

04:55.396 --> 04:57.831
WHERE I'M NOT WORRYING ABOUT
SOMEONE WITH CANCER.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.968
I GUESS, BUT ON THE OTHER
HAND, NEW GIRL,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.937
-BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.
-MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.408
MAYBE YOU'D BE MORE POPULAR
IF YOU STOPPED EATING
THOSE GROSS PICKLE CHIPS.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.875
SHUT UP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.446
-YOU CAN HAVE ONE.
-NO.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.579
THEY'RE SO GOOD.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.684
I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN WRACKING MY BRAIN,

05:16.716 --> 05:20.019
BUT NOTHING FROM DAD'S
LAST YEAR STANDS OUT TO ME.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.557
WELL, EDWIN SAID
HE COMPLETELY CHANGED.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.360
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE ANYTHING?

05:26.393 --> 05:28.961
I MEAN, THAT WAS
THREE YEARS AGO.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.031
I REMEMBER HIM
TRAVELING A LOT

05:31.064 --> 05:32.598
WHO WAS TRAVELING?

05:36.437 --> 05:37.504
MOM...

05:38.971 --> 05:41.442
NATALIE FOUND
A MANUSCRIPT

05:41.475 --> 05:43.009
THAT DAD WAS
WORKING ON WHEN HE DIED,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.745
AND IT'S BROUGHT UP...

05:44.778 --> 05:47.380
A LOT OF QUESTIONS
FROM HIS LAST YEAR.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.483
-HE WAS PROBABLY GOING--
-OH, STOP.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.452
YOU DAD'S PAST IS
A DOOR I JUST...

05:52.485 --> 05:54.120
I DON'T FEEL THE NEED
TO OPEN AGAIN.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.389
THIS IS APRIL'S
LAST WEEK AT HOME.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.959
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY THIS TIME
WITH MY WONDERFUL DAUGHTERS.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.762
-OKAY.
-(chuckles)

06:06.600 --> 06:10.403
"APRIL CARVER:
MOST IMPROVED."

06:10.437 --> 06:13.841
-FROM THE GYMNASTICS COACH.
-OH WOW. "MOST IMPROVED"

06:13.874 --> 06:16.576
IS BASICALLY JUST
SAYING YOU SUCKED LESS
BY THE END OF IT.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.146
-SO... (chuckles)
-AWW.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.449
-YOU WORKED SO HARD.
-DID I?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.653
MMM.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.858
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOUR LAST WEEK AT HOME.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.060
LEO AND I WILL BE CLOSE BY.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.562
I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE
SOME GETTING USED TO...

06:36.596 --> 06:40.667
NOT HAVING DINNER
WITH YOU EVERY NIGHT,

06:40.701 --> 06:44.805
-NOT HEARING YOU TWO
FIGHT OVER THE BATHROOM.
-(laughter)

06:45.872 --> 06:48.542
I'LL MISS JUST SEEING YOU
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.944
-MOM, STOP.
-NO, LOOKIT.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.747
I KNOW I'VE BEEN SPOILED
HAVING YOU HERE

06:53.781 --> 06:55.449
AS LONG AS I HAVE.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.485
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE PACKED
YOU UP FOR COLLEGE,

06:59.519 --> 07:01.754
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D BE LIVING HERE AGAIN.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.057
AND I NEVER
COULD HAVE GUESSED

07:04.091 --> 07:08.127
THAT WHEN YOU DID MOVE OUT,
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE
GONNA GET MARRIED.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.533
I NEVER COULD'VE GUESSED
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW,

07:12.565 --> 07:17.504
BUT THERE ARE
SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING
THAT I AM EXCITED ABOUT.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.507
I AM GETTING MARRIED.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.543
I'VE GOT AN AMAZING HONEYMOON
PLANNED IN ITALY,

07:23.576 --> 07:25.946
-I MIGHT WRITE A BOOK.
-(door opens, slams)

07:25.978 --> 07:28.447
Emma: AND DON'T EVER
CALL ME AGAIN!

07:32.185 --> 07:34.721
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE...

07:34.754 --> 07:36.723
GETTING TO KNOW
YOU LADIES.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.898
-(door opens, closes)
-WELL, SAM AND I BROKE UP.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.834
MOM, WHAT HAPPENED?

07:46.867 --> 07:49.636
WELL, WE WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS
AND WE COULDN'T WORK IT OUT.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.639
-WHAT KIND OF THINGS?
-NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
KIND OF THINGS.

07:52.673 --> 07:56.610
I'M FINE! HE'S A TOOL,
AND I'M MOVING ON.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.182
I WAS SO SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.785
HE WAS ONE OF BOSTON'S
BEST WRITERS,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.252
AND HE MUST'VE BEEN
A GREAT MAN.

08:06.485 --> 08:07.788
WELL, I THINK
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.889
AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR DOMINIC IS SO IMPRESSIVE.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.158
DOM IS A NATURAL TALENT,

08:12.192 --> 08:13.627
AND HE SAYS
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.629
WELL, THAT'S A LOT
TO LIVE UP TO,

08:15.661 --> 08:18.564
-BUT I'M PSYCHED TO TRY.
-AND I'M PSYCHED TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.968
OKAY, WELL,
I HAVE BEEN BRAINSTORMING
THIS ONE IDEA.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.637
IT WAS ACTUALLY INSPIRED
BY A PIECE I WAS RESEARCHING
FOR THE  POST.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.172
IT'S ABOUT A MISSING WOMAN
AND HER HUSBAND--

08:25.204 --> 08:28.007
THE MARKET'S PRETTY FLOODED
WITH  GONE GIRLS  RIGHT NOW.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.911
I HAVE THIS OTHER IDEA
THAT I REALLY LIKE.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.746
IT'S ABOUT THESE TWO
ADULT SISTERS, AND IT'S
THEIR DAD'S WEDDING DAY--

08:33.779 --> 08:35.115
APRIL, I'M GONNA
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.884
I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH LUCK
SELLING CHICK-LIT WRITERS.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.754
UMM, I HAVE THIS FUTURISTIC
LOVE STORY IDEA

08:40.787 --> 08:42.588
-I THINK IS PROMISING.
-FUTURISTIC?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.557
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
A LITTLE YOUNG ADULT-ISH,

08:44.591 --> 08:45.993
BUT THE STORY
COULD BE REALLY COMPELLING.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.528
-Y.A. IS A GREAT IDEA FOR YOU.
-REALLY?

08:48.562 --> 08:50.529
IT'S AN EVERGREEN MARKET,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

08:50.563 --> 08:52.665
THAT KIND
OF DEBUT NOVEL FROM YOU

08:52.698 --> 08:54.801
COULD BE POSITIONED
AS A YOUNG ADULT  KEYS.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.903
YOU THINK PEOPLE
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT?

08:56.937 --> 08:59.005
I THINK THE NEW YORK
PUBLISHING HOUSES WOULD.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.575
IF YOU COULD WORK ON THIS
FULL-TIME, IT'S POSSIBLE

09:01.607 --> 09:05.077
WE COULD HAVE A BOOK
ON SHELVES IN THREE YEARS,
MAYBE EVEN TWO.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
-TWO OR THREE YEARS?
-MM-HMM.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.984
(chuckles)
I GUESS...

09:11.018 --> 09:13.620
WITH MY DAD,
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE HE ALWAYS
HAD A BOOK COMING OUT.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.121
HE'S AN ESTABLISHED AUTHOR.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.090
I WOULD LOVE
TO WORK WITH YOU, APRIL.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.025
I HAVE TO HEAD BACK HOME
EARLY NEXT WEEK,

09:19.058 --> 09:21.161
SO IF YOU WANT TO GET STARTED,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY MEET AGAIN

09:21.193 --> 09:22.962
BEFORE I LEAVE
TO MAKE SOME PLANS.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.097
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:28.302 --> 09:30.202
April:
TWO OR THREE YEARS?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.773
DO I HAVE TWO OR THREE YEARS?
I MEAN, LET'S BE REAL.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.740
THIS COULD BE
MY ONLY BOOK.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.109
THIS COULD BE
WHAT I LEAVE BEHIND.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.044
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE
A DECISION ON WHAT TO WRITE

09:38.077 --> 09:39.278
WITH THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.048
I KNOW SHE'S SICK,
BUT SHE'S INTENSE.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.951
I LOVE IT.
PERFECT FOR YOU.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.952
FRANKIE, WHAT DID WE SAY
ABOUT UNFILTERED HONESTY?

09:45.985 --> 09:47.988
WELL, SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE. SORRY.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.923
YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING.

09:49.956 --> 09:52.158
LEO TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT HOW YOU TWO
FELL OUT OF TOUCH,

09:52.192 --> 09:55.227
BUT YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
HE THOUGHT OF WHEN IT CAME
TO HIS BEST MAN.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.099
THOUGH BY BEST MAN,
I WASN'T EXPECTING THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PERSON EVER.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.101
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER
IN HER AWKWARD STAGES.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.037
OH, YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT AWKWARD STAGES?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.840
-WELL, I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF AWKWARD--
-I WANT THOSE STORIES.

10:06.873 --> 10:11.177
OKAY, WELL, WE SHOULD FOCUS
ON THE MOST PERTINENT
TOPIC AT HAND,

10:11.211 --> 10:15.048
APRIL'S BOOK. THE SOLUTION
TO WHICH SEEMS QUITE CLEAR--

10:15.081 --> 10:18.751
-DO WHAT THE AGENT SAYS.
-(sighs) YOU THINK?

10:18.784 --> 10:21.788
WHEN YOU LOOK AT DECISIONS
LIKE THIS AS LIFE OR DEATH,

10:21.822 --> 10:24.390
OF COURSE THEY'RE PARALYZING.
SO STOP!

10:24.624 --> 10:27.394
YOU WANT TO BE
A PUBLISHED AUTHOR.
THIS AGENT CAN GET THAT FOR YOU.

10:27.626 --> 10:31.063
SO GO WRITE YOUR
YOUNG ADULT MASTERPIECE,
AND GET THE ENDURING FAME

10:31.097 --> 10:33.133
AND SOCIAL MEDIA BRAGGING
RIGHTS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.001
YEAH, AND WHEN
YOUR BOOK'S SUCCESSFUL,

10:35.034 --> 10:39.072
LEO CAN FINALLY BE
THE USELESS TROPHY HUSBAND
HE WAS ALWAYS DESTINED TO BE.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.008
ANOTHER FANTASTIC POINT.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.076
WELL, IF I WANT
TO GET PUBLISHED,
THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.080
THERE YOU GO!
NOW, GET TO WORK.
NO MORE STALLING.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.850
OH, SOMETHING ELSE CAME UP.
WE NEED ANOTHER BAND
FOR THE WEDDING.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.251
-CLASSIC STALLING TACTIC.
-NO, I'M SERIOUS.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.254
THE BAND CALLED.
THEY DOUBLE-BOOKED,
SO THEY CANCELED ON US.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.157
OKAY. WELL, FINE.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.991
-FRANKIE AND I WILL
FIND A BAND.
-YEAH.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.927
AND YOU FOCUS
ON WRITING YOUR BOOK.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.196
ALL RIGHT?
NOW WRITE!

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
WRITE LIKE
THE WIND. WRITE!

11:09.403 --> 11:12.339
BUNCH OF US ARE GOING
TO A PARTY AT TAYLOR'S TONIGHT.
CAN YOU MAKE IT?

11:12.371 --> 11:15.341
NO, I STILL CAN'T BE
OUT IN PUBLIC LIKE THAT.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.744
-GERMS AND STUFF.
-THAT BITES, MAN.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.880
-MAYBE NEXT TIME.
-YEAH. MAYBE.

11:28.154 --> 11:32.759
SO, GOING TO SCHOOL
IS THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO?

11:32.793 --> 11:37.197
-THAT'S A BUMMER.
-YEAH, WELL, I'M HAPPY TO BE OUT
OF MY BORING, STERILE HOUSE.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.200
DOCTOR'S THINK
I'M ALREADY TAKING A RISK
BEING BACK IN SCHOOL THIS FAST,

11:40.232 --> 11:43.036
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?
THIS IS THE FACE OF A REBEL.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.072
(both laugh)

11:45.105 --> 11:47.139
ARE YOU NEUTROPENIC?

11:47.173 --> 11:49.341
YEAH, I AM, AND HOW DO
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.477
MY SISTER HAS LEUKEMIA.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.014
I KNOW MORE
ABOUT CANCER AT 17
THAN I EVER THOUGHT I WOULD.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.850
YEAH, ME TOO.
(chuckles)

11:59.452 --> 12:01.888
HEY, YOU SHOULD
COME OVER TONIGHT.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.356
EVERYONE'S GONNA
BE OUT OF THE HOUSE
EXCEPT FOR ME AND MY FRIEND,

12:04.390 --> 12:08.095
AND BECAUSE OF MY SISTER,
THE HOUSE IS TOTALLY STERILE.

12:08.128 --> 12:12.231
YEAH. YEAH, I--
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.433
-COOL.
-YEAH, VERY COOL.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.735
THANKS.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.514
(deadpan)
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.250
(deadpan)
STOP. YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T GET EMOTIONAL.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.120
SO, HOW DO WE EVEN FIND
A WEDDING BAND?

12:34.153 --> 12:37.857
DO WE PUT UP FLIERS?
"WANTED: ONE WEDDING BAND."

12:37.890 --> 12:41.193
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
SOPHOMORE YEAR WE TRIED
TO START A COVER BAND?

12:42.294 --> 12:44.130
IT WAS ONE OF THE DUMBEST
THINGS WE EVER DID.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.067
SPEAKING OF DUMB
THINGS THAT WE DID,

12:48.100 --> 12:49.903
REMEMBER THAT TIME
THAT YOU EMAILED ME

12:49.936 --> 12:52.272
THAT YOU HAD CANCER
AND I NEVER HEARD
FROM YOU AGAIN?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.176
OH, BY THE WAY,
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.546
-OW! DUDE!
-DID YOU REALLY THINK THAT
AFTER YEARS OF RADIO SILENCE,

12:59.778 --> 13:01.114
THAT I WOULD
JUST HOP ON A PLANE,

13:01.148 --> 13:03.884
COME AND BE YOUR BEST MAN,
AND NEVER BRING THIS UP?

13:03.917 --> 13:05.451
YOU WERE
A REAL DOUCHE TO ME.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.288
OKAY, WELL, LOOK,
I WAS TO EVERYONE.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.190
SINCE WHEN WAS
I EVERYONE?

13:10.222 --> 13:12.292
MY BEST FRIEND WAS DYING

13:12.325 --> 13:14.193
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.196
I KNOW. I...

13:16.229 --> 13:19.032
DID A LOT OF STUPID THINGS
WHEN I WAS SICK.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.799
BUT I'M NOT
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.568
I'VE CHANGED. I HAVE.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.239
AND IF THERE'S
ANY SILVER LINING TO WHAT
GREW IN MY HEAD,

13:26.273 --> 13:29.208
IT'S THAT. I MEAN...

13:29.241 --> 13:33.413
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
SOMEONE AS SMART, AND...

13:33.446 --> 13:36.182
BEAUTIFUL,
AND WONDERFULLY WEIRD

13:36.216 --> 13:38.985
AS THAT GIRL YOU JUST MET,
WOULD MARRY THE OLD ME?

13:40.052 --> 13:41.254
(whispers) YEAH.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.561
YEAH, WELL, BEFORE SHE WISES UP
AND LEAVES YOUR BUTT
AT THE ALTAR,

13:47.594 --> 13:50.263
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO
WHAT YOU PROMISED WE'D DO.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.164
YES! TO THE INTERNET!

13:52.198 --> 13:56.469
LET'S SEE HERE.
ALL RIGHT, "WEDDING BANDS."

13:58.337 --> 14:01.240
AND THERE ARE
A HUNDRED PICTURES
OF GOLD RINGS.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.176
-HMM.
-WE'RE SCREWED.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.317
I CANT BELIEVE
YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER.
THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.586
I'M SO IMPRESSED.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.254
I HEARD NINA WAS IMPRESSED.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.256
SHE EMAILED ME
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.292
WELL, SHE WAS GREAT,
AND I'VE ALREADY STARTED

14:19.326 --> 14:21.027
OUTLINING AN IDEA
THAT SHE LIKES.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.331
WOW. SOUNDS LIKE THIS
IS COMING TOGETHER
PRETTY FAST.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.571
THIS MAY BE THE ONLY BOOK
I EVER GET TO WRITE.

14:31.605 --> 14:34.374
I WANNA LEAVE BEHIND
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

14:34.407 --> 14:39.312
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PRESSURE
YOU MUST FEEL,

14:39.346 --> 14:42.249
AND PUBLISHING A BOOK IS
DEFINITELY A WAY TO LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.384
TRY NOT TO THINK
SO MUCH ABOUT THE MARKET.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.921
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

14:51.423 --> 14:55.227
-(cellphone chimes)
-SORRY. IT'S PROBABLY LEO.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.398
OUR WEDDING BAND BACKED OUT.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.333
'CAUSE THE WEDDING,
THE BOOK, AND THE BACHELORETTE
PARTY WEREN'T ENOUGH.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.504
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'M HELPING YOU
WITH THE BOOK DILEMMA,

15:05.538 --> 15:09.042
BUT MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.378
-HEY.
-HEY.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.648
-HI.
-OH, HEY, DOMINIC IS
GETTING US A BAND,

15:14.681 --> 15:17.517
-AND A REALLY GOOD ONE.
-OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS DOMINIC IS,

15:17.549 --> 15:20.052
-BUT HE MIGHT BE
MY NEW BEST FRIEND.
-HOLD UP.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.088
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF DOM,
BUT FRANKIE AND I HAVE
THE BAND SITUATION COVERED.

15:23.123 --> 15:27.394
THAT IS SO NOT EVEN
THE SLIGHTEST BIT,
REMOTELY TRUE.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.596
WELL, HE KNOWS THIS BAND
PERSONALLY AND THEY DON'T
NORMALLY DO WEDDINGS,

15:29.629 --> 15:31.264
BUT HE THINKS THAT
THEY'LL DO IT AS A FAVOR.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.966
HE'S GONNA ASK THEM
AT THEIR SHOW TONIGHT.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.635
ISN'T BAND PROCUREMENT
TRADITIONALLY THE ROLE
OF THE GROOM?

15:36.669 --> 15:38.504
-UM, DID HE MAKE THAT UP?
-UMM...

15:38.538 --> 15:41.206
-YEAH, I THINK HE MADE THAT UP.
NO, THAT'S NOT A THING.
-HM-MMM.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.176
OKAY, WELL, JUST GIVE US
MORE TIME, OKAY?

15:43.209 --> 15:45.945
'CAUSE FRANKIE AND I,
WE'VE GOT SOME...

15:45.979 --> 15:47.346
SOLID LEADS.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.048
-BABE.
-YEAH.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.250
I JUST WANT MUSIC,
SO I CAN DANCE WITH YOU
AT OUR WEDDING.

15:51.283 --> 15:55.120
-WHO CARES WHO BOOKS THE BAND?
-ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL GO
TO THE SHOW TONIGHT.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.289
IT'S OUR WEDDING.
ONE OF US SHOULD BE THERE.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.125
AND SINCE YOU'RE
AT YOUR BACHELORETTE PARTY,

15:59.158 --> 16:01.561
FRANKIE AND I WILL GO
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE BAND
IS RIGHT FOR US.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.496
-OKAY, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO.
-OF COURSE WE DO!

16:05.565 --> 16:08.634
-I'LL TEXT DOM AND LET HIM
KNOW YOU'LL MEET HIM THERE.
-YAY!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.743
YEAH, AND WHEN GABE
CAME TO PICK ME UP,

16:16.975 --> 16:20.413
HE CAME RIGHT TO THE DOOR.
HE DIDN'T JUST TEXT AND SAY
HE WAS OUTSIDE.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.015
-AWW.
-GIVE IT TIME.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.384
SHE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
A BIT OF A BREAKUP.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.020
MEN ACT LIKE
THEY'RE ALL IN,

16:28.053 --> 16:30.724
BUT WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH,
THEY'RE OUTTA THERE.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.726
-AMEN, SISTER.
-I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.995
I'M SORRY
I'M CRASHING.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.197
YOU'RE NOT CRASHING.
MEG SAID SHE MIGHT BRING YOU.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.400
AND I'M... SO GLAD SHE DID.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.769
OH, GUYS, THIS IS
MEG AND VANESSA.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.739
-HEY.
-SORRY YOU GUYS MISSED
THE WINE-TASTING.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.706
WE TASTED
SOME OAKY WINES.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.743
AN HOUR AND A HALF
WITH A SOMMELIER,

16:49.775 --> 16:52.245
AND STILL THE ONLY WINE TERM
BETH KNOWS IS "OAKY."

16:52.278 --> 16:54.713
-(laughter)
-IT'S TRUE. LET'S GET YOU
CAUGHT UP, THOUGH.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.014
-ALCOHOL, STAT!
-YES!

16:56.048 --> 16:58.283
SOMETHING OAKY
COMING RIGHT UP!

16:58.317 --> 17:02.522
ISN'T IT SO AMAZING
THAT LEO AND APRIL
ARE GETTING MARRIED?

17:02.554 --> 17:05.090
YOU KNOW, WHEN APRIL
WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

17:05.125 --> 17:06.792
SHE DID VOW TO MARRY LEO,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.230
BUT AT THE TIME,
SHE MEANT LEO DiCAPRIO.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.799
-(laughter)
-I NEVER WOULD'VE LET HIM
FREEZE IN THE OCEAN.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.469
-YEAH, BUT DID YOU WANT
TO MARRY LEO OR JACK?
-DEFINITELY JACK.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.439
SEE? SEE? FICTIONAL CHARACTER
CRUSHES ARE ALWAYS BETTER
THAN THE ACTORS.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.708
I MEAN, EWAN McGREGOR
IN  MOULIN ROUGE

17:21.740 --> 17:24.778
-WAS MY SEXUAL AWAKENING.
-MMM. I DATED A GUY

17:24.810 --> 17:26.613
WHO WAS ONLY
INTO FICTIONAL CHARACTERS,

17:26.645 --> 17:29.115
-AND IT DIDN'T LAST LONG...
-Women: AW.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.317
-...EVEN WITH
THE DRESSING UP.
-(laughter)

17:31.351 --> 17:34.421
-YOU'RE GOING TO
EMBARRASS ME, AREN'T YOU?
-I'M... (chuckles)

17:34.453 --> 17:38.124
I HAD A THING
FOR LLOYD DOBLER
IN  SAY ANYTHING.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.826
YOU MEAN WITH THE TRENCH COAT
AND THE BOOM BOX?

17:40.058 --> 17:42.761
YES! HE WAS SO ROMANTIC
IN THAT MOVIE,

17:42.796 --> 17:46.266
AND HE WAS SO SEXY.
THOMAS TOOK ME TO SEE IT,

17:46.298 --> 17:49.402
AND THAT NIGHT AFTERWARDS,
WE HAD THE BEST...

17:52.838 --> 17:55.607
-DINNER.
-(laughter)

17:55.642 --> 17:59.311
-MOM!
-OH MY GOD!

17:59.345 --> 18:04.717
♪ CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU,
I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED
FOR MORE ♪

18:04.750 --> 18:10.123
♪ OOH, THIS IS REAL LOVE ♪

18:10.155 --> 18:12.724
I'M NOT IMPRESSED. YOU?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.662
YOU WOULD BE LUCKY
TO GET THESE GUYS
TO PLAY AT YOUR WEDDING.

18:18.330 --> 18:23.102
SO, IS THERE SOME SORT
OF HISTORY BETWEEN
THIS DOMINIC AND APRIL?

18:24.570 --> 18:27.105
-MAYBE.
-I KNEW IT! YOU'RE JEALOUS.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.241
AND A HYPOCRITE,
'CAUSE APRIL SEEMS
TO HAVE NO PROBLEM

18:29.275 --> 18:30.844
WITH THE FACT THAT
YOU AND I USED TO DATE.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.179
OKAY, I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT UNFORTUNATE WEEK

18:33.212 --> 18:35.114
IN SIXTH GRADE
REALLY COMPARES HERE.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.182
IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE
DOMINIC USED TO DATE APRIL.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.352
IT'S ALSO BECAUSE HE'S...

18:39.384 --> 18:41.820
EARNEST AND INGRATIATING.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.824
HE'S LIKE A GREETING CARD
WITH DIMPLES.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.594
(cheers, applause)

18:50.730 --> 18:53.199
HEY. HEY, YOU MUST BE FRANKIE.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.433
-HEY.
-DOMINIC.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.170
-GREAT BAND.
-YEAH, AMAZING SOUND.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.240
-WANT ME TO SEE IF THEY'LL
DO YOUR WEDDING?
-I DON'T KNOW.

19:00.272 --> 19:03.809
-STILL MULLING.
-YOU DON'T LIKE 'EM,
NO WORRIES.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.545
BUT IF YOU DO,
I SHOULD TALK TO THEM SOON.

19:05.577 --> 19:08.548
GONNA GRAB US ANOTHER
ROUND FROM BACKSTAGE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

19:10.682 --> 19:14.153
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO "CANCER MADE ME
A NICE GUY"?

19:14.186 --> 19:17.891
IT DID.
JUST... TO EVERYONE BUT HIM.

19:18.892 --> 19:22.528
THE GUY IS TRYING TO DO YOU
A FAVOR, AND YOU'RE TREATING
HIM LIKE CRAP.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.230
YOU WON, OKAY?
APRIL IS MARRYING YOU.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.333
NOW DOMINIC IS HER FRIEND,
SO YOU CAN EITHER ENGAGE

19:27.366 --> 19:29.701
IN THIS LAME
PISSING CONTEST FOREVER,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.938
OR YOU CAN TRY AND SUCK IT UP

19:32.171 --> 19:34.840
AND BE THE BETTER MAN THAT
YOU'VE CLAIMED YOU'VE BECOME.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.676
♪ NOW AND FOREVER ♪

19:45.919 --> 19:50.222
-SO YOU NORMALLY WEAR A MASK?

UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.458
OR IF I WANT
TO PLAY ZORRO.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.460
(laughs)

19:55.662 --> 19:57.829
FINN, IF YOU WANT
ANY SNACKS,

19:57.864 --> 20:00.199
-THOSE ARE ALL NEUTROPENIC.
-I'M OKAY. THANKS.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.902
HYPOTHETICALLY,
LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.704
-IS THERE A SECRET OPENING?
-FORD!

20:05.738 --> 20:07.973
WELL, MAKING OUT
REALLY ISN'T ON THE TABLE.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.343
THE WHOLE "UNCONTROLLED
ENVIRONMENT" THING,

20:10.375 --> 20:13.246
BUT LUCKILY I'M NOT
SWIMMING IN OFFERS.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.914
I'LL MAKE OUT WITH YOU.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.917
FORD, HE JUST SAID
THAT HE CAN'T MAKE OUT!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

20:19.952 --> 20:23.221
UM, MAYBE-- MAYBE I SHOULD--
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.924
WHY? ARE YOU TIRED.
IF YOU'RE TIRED,
YOU CAN LIE DOWN.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.661
NO, I'M NOT TIRED,
I JUST...

20:28.694 --> 20:31.631
I THOUGHT, BECAUSE OF
YOUR SISTER, YOU WOULDN'T
ACT WEIRD AROUND ME,

20:31.663 --> 20:34.701
BUT YOU'RE TREATING ME
LIKE SOME CANCER PATIENT.

20:38.270 --> 20:42.307
I'M-- I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE A CANCER PATIENT.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.377
AND I KNOW, BECAUSE OF APRIL,
HOW THINGS CAN BE BAD FOR YOU.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.347
-IT JUST MAKES ME ANXIOUS.
-WELL, IF I MAKE YOU SO ANXIOUS,

20:48.381 --> 20:51.984
-THEN WHY DID YOU INVITE ME?
-BECAUSE YOU HAVE CANCER
AND I FEEL BAD FOR YOU.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.390
I'M-- I'M SORRY.
I-- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.261
HEY, FORD,
YOU WANNA MAKE OUT?

21:03.296 --> 21:06.298
YEAH! YES.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.805
WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN ON
EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD BEHAVIOR.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.976
-DID MEG GIVE YOU A STERN
TALKING TO OR SOMETHING?
-OKAY, GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.278
I KNOW I GIVE YOU
A HARD TIME, BUT...

21:19.311 --> 21:21.314
I THINK YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.048
-OH.
-TWO WHISKEY SHOTS, PLEASE.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.818
SO, ARE YOU DATING ANYONE?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.654
ME? NO.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.023
NO, THE MONOGAMY THING
IS NOT REALLY FOR ME.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.326
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED? LIKE EVER?

21:33.358 --> 21:36.895
OH NO. PERSONALLY, NO.
GOD, I LIKE MY FREEDOM.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.565
BUT... BUT GOOD FOR YOU,

21:39.598 --> 21:42.969
FOR WANTING TO
COMMIT TO LEO AND BEING
OKAY WITH ALL OF THAT.

21:43.001 --> 21:47.306
NEVER BEING SINGLE AGAIN,
AND KNOWING HE'S THE LAST PERSON
YOU'RE EVER GONNA SLEEP WITH.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.376
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S WEIRD.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.880
-PEOPLE GET MARRIED
ALL THE TIME.
-YEAH.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.883
I MEAN,
NOT PEOPLE LIKE US.

21:56.915 --> 22:00.053
MOST PEOPLE CAN TIE THE KNOT,
AND SAY "FOREVER,"

22:00.086 --> 22:03.355
BUT DEEP DOWN KNOW THAT HALF
OF MARRIAGES END IN DIVORCE.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.991
THEY COULD BE SINGLE AGAIN.
THEY LIKELY WILL BE.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.362
BUT YOU AND I ARE
ACTUALLY COMMITTING TO

22:09.394 --> 22:11.631
SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES,

22:11.663 --> 22:14.067
POTENTIALLY THE VERY
FEW DAYS WE HAVE LEFT,

22:14.099 --> 22:16.335
TIED DOWN
TO ANOTHER PERSON.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.938
WHEN YOU AND I SAY
"TILL DEATH DO US PART,"

22:18.971 --> 22:21.740
WE REALLY MEAN IT.
IT'S THE END.

22:25.811 --> 22:28.346
BUT HEY,
IF THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

22:28.381 --> 22:31.584
MAZEL TOV. YOU ARE
A BRAVER WOMAN THAN I.

22:41.993 --> 22:45.397
WAIT! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
MY BACHELORETTE PARTY
IS OVER ALREADY?

22:45.431 --> 22:47.599
OH, BABE,
IT'S GOTTA END SOMETIME.

22:49.868 --> 22:53.105
-LET'S GO TO A STRIP CLUB!
-Girls: YES!

22:53.138 --> 22:55.974

22:59.912 --> 23:01.713

23:31.042 --> 23:34.413
HEY, SWEETIE,
YOU ARE BEING SO DELIGHTFUL,

23:34.447 --> 23:36.982
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ASK
WHAT'S WITH APRIL GONE WILD?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.817
BETH-- DEAR, SWEET BETH,

23:38.851 --> 23:41.653
WHAT WERE WE THINKING WITH
A CLASSY BACHELORETTE PARTY?

23:41.686 --> 23:44.656
I ADMIT IT MIGHT BE WEIRD
TO BRING YOUR GRANDMA
TO A STRIP CLUB,

23:44.690 --> 23:46.726
WHICH, BY THE WAY, IT IS!

23:47.960 --> 23:49.095
HI, FELLAS.

23:49.127 --> 23:52.798
MY ENTIRE LIFE IS
AT A CROSSROADS, OKAY?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.967
I HAVE ONE WEEK
LEFT AT HOME.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.936
THIS COULD BE ONE
OF MY ONLY NIGHTS

23:57.970 --> 24:01.840
TO BE A SINGLE GIRL OUT
WITH HER SINGLE GIRLFRIENDS.

24:01.874 --> 24:05.178
DO YOU REALIZE THAT
I COULD NEVER BE SINGLE AGAIN!

24:05.211 --> 24:09.714
THIS IS MY LAST FREAKING HURRAH,
AND THAT'S WHY WE GOTTA
DO IT RIGHT.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.551
HEY, COME ON,
IT'S NORMAL TO BE NERVOUS
BEFORE YOUR WEDDING,

24:12.585 --> 24:14.519
YEAH, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BE SINGLE AGAIN,

24:14.554 --> 24:18.590
BUT YOU'RE MARRYING LEO!
THINK OF ALL THE EXCITING THINGS
THAT COME WITH THAT.

24:18.624 --> 24:22.795
LIKE WHAT? BABIES?
GOLDEN ANNIVERSARIES?

24:22.828 --> 24:28.034
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
LIKE THAT, BUT I CAN'T COUNT
ON ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

24:29.067 --> 24:33.638
THAT'S WHY, TONIGHT,
HAS TO BE LEGENDARY.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.875
THAT'S WHY I NEED...

24:37.476 --> 24:40.246
(gasps)
A BUNCH OF DOLLAR BILLS!

24:40.479 --> 24:43.148
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
GET YOU SOME CHANGE.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.484
-COME ON. LET'S GET
A BETTER VIEW.
-OKAY.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.592
WHOO!

24:54.192 --> 24:56.929
-LET'S GO
CATCH UP WITH THE GIRLS.
-NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.598
I MEAN, IT WAS SWEET
OF APRIL TO INCLUDE ME,

24:59.632 --> 25:01.767
BUT, REALLY, SHE'S GONNA
HAVE A LOT MORE FUN
WITH HER FRIENDS.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.670
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HIDE OUT ALL NIGHT?

25:04.703 --> 25:07.539
-YOU SHOULD ENJOY THE SHOW.
-NO, I'M FINE.

25:07.573 --> 25:10.209
REALLY, STRIP CLUBS
ARE NOT MY SCENE.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.278
DISAGREE. STRIP CLUBS
ARE EVERYONE'S SCENE.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.981
I'M GOING TO PROVE
YOU WRONG, SARA CARTER.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.989
NATALIE?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.691
NATALIE,
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.730
TALKED TO THE GUYS,
AND THEY'RE IN IF YOU ARE.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.298
OH, THAT'S AWESOME. RIGHT?

25:34.299 --> 25:37.269
(clears throat)
DOMINIC, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.638
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.707
YOU'RE WELCOME, MAN.
HAPPY TO HELP.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.077
SO, ANY WORD FROM APRIL'S
BACHELORETTE PARTY?

25:46.112 --> 25:48.146
OH, YOU KNOW,
I DID JUST GET A TEXT--

25:48.180 --> 25:49.949
IT SAYS...

25:51.049 --> 25:54.319
"STRIPPERS!" WITH ABOUT
10,000 EXCLAMATION POINTS.

25:54.552 --> 25:55.922
-MMM!
-APRIL AT A STRIP CLUB.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.556
I'M SURE IT'S THE ONE
WITH THE BEST YELP REVIEWS.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.325
-RIGHT?
-(laughter)

25:59.557 --> 26:02.929
-SO SHE'S PRETTY TYPE "A," HUH?
-I TRIED TO TAKE HER
TO A RESTAURANT ONCE,

26:02.961 --> 26:04.763
THAT WE WERE
JUST PASSING BY--

26:04.797 --> 26:08.233
WHOA, WHOA, BAD MOVE.
WHAT IF SOMEONE GAVE THEM
TWO STARS IN JUNE 2011?

26:08.267 --> 26:11.871
(laughter)

26:11.903 --> 26:13.972
SO, HOW ABOUT YOU, LEO?
WHEN'S YOUR BACHELOR PARTY?

26:14.006 --> 26:16.208
UM, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE DOING ONE.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.077
ACTUALLY... SURPRISE!

26:19.111 --> 26:21.047
-IT'S NOW!
-(chuckles)

26:21.079 --> 26:23.182
REALLY? THIS IS
MY BACHELOR PARTY?

26:23.214 --> 26:25.151
YEAH, I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
WE GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.953
WE'VE GOT MUSIC, ALCOHOL,

26:27.987 --> 26:30.088
-FRIENDS.
-YEAH, FRIENDS.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.857
WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.
(clears throat)

26:34.026 --> 26:37.096
YOU WANT TO JOIN,
DIM...INIC?

26:37.128 --> 26:38.364
DOMINIC?

26:39.365 --> 26:41.800
SURE. WHY NOT?

26:41.834 --> 26:44.135
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THE PARTY STARTED.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.704
BACHELOR PARTY.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.140
-BAM!
-HERE WE GO.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.183
DON'T DO IT!

26:59.250 --> 27:01.287
YOU'RE KIND OF KILLING
THE MOOD HERE.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.089
FINN, I'M SORRY I SAID
THAT I FELT BAD FOR YOU,

27:04.123 --> 27:06.125
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS
TO PROVE A POINT.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.193
I'M NOT PROVING A POINT.
I'M JUST MAKING OUT
WITH A GIRL.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.096
BUT FORD IS
COVERED IN GERMS!

27:10.128 --> 27:12.365
I'VE SEEN HER LICK
A PARKING METER BEFORE!

27:12.397 --> 27:15.334
THAT WAS ONE TIME.
IT WAS TO MAKE A POINT
ABOUT BUREAUCRACY.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.068
IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.372
NO, I THINK IT IS, OKAY?

27:25.243 --> 27:27.779
I-- I CAN'T--
I CAN'T DO IT.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.317
-FINN, IT'S OKAY.
-NO, IT'S NOT, OKAY?

27:32.351 --> 27:35.121
I'M ALONE
IN A HOUSE WITH TWO GIRLS,
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

27:35.153 --> 27:37.957
IS GERMS AND HOW MUCH
I COULD REALLY USE A NAP.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.759
I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF 17-YEAR-OLD AM I?

27:40.792 --> 27:43.662
I KNOW I'M LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE, RIGHT,

27:43.695 --> 27:45.765
BUT SOMETIMES
THERE'S SO MANY RULES

27:45.798 --> 27:49.000
AND THINGS I CAN'T DO
THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL
MUCH LIKE LIVING.

27:53.138 --> 27:54.839
I HAVE AN IDEA.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.145
I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING WHEN
WOMEN SEXUALIZE THEMSELVES

28:00.179 --> 28:01.346
FOR THE PLEASURE
OF THE MALE GAZE.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.882
WELL, THEN DON'T THINK
OF IT LIKE THAT.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.849
THINK OF IT
AS A FAVOR TO ME.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.751
THIS WAS
YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.953
-SHUT UP.
-(both laugh)

28:22.334 --> 28:25.003
WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
NOT TIRED NOW.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.772
(laughing)

28:29.275 --> 28:30.976
-(rock music playing)
-(Sara whispering)
NATALIE, NO!

28:31.009 --> 28:32.845
-WHAT IS THIS ROOM?
-YOU'LL SEE!

28:32.877 --> 28:35.713
(sighs) OH MY-- JUST--

28:35.748 --> 28:38.784
-WE'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK HERE!
-SHH!

30:22.253 --> 30:24.923
LOOK AT THE ASS
ON THAT SAILOR!

30:24.957 --> 30:28.993
WOW! I NEVER PEGGED YOU
FOR AN ASS WOMAN, CARVER.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.563
YOU SHOULD GET UP THERE
AND DANCE WITH HIM.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.332

JUST GET UP AND DANCE.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.568

(whooping, cheering)

31:14.906 --> 31:17.276
MA'AM, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO STEP OFF THE STAGE

31:17.308 --> 31:19.545
-AND TAKE A SEAT.
-OH, NO, NO, READ THE SHIRT.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.380
"I'M THE BRIDE, BITCH"!

31:21.413 --> 31:23.882
-I'M STILL GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO STEP AWAY FROM--
-HEY, HOW DARE YOU?

31:23.915 --> 31:26.518
OKAY, I'M SOMEBODY'S WIFE,
BASICALLY.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.054
-SIR!
-YOU-- YOU-- HEY, YOU!

31:29.087 --> 31:31.624
GET YOUR DAMN HANDS
OFF MY GRANDDAUGHTER!

31:31.656 --> 31:32.891
(cell door slams)

31:32.924 --> 31:35.227
Man:
JAKE, YOU'VE GOT
TWO ON THE GATE.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.430
BUT... I'M A BRIDE.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.369
(lock clicking)

31:49.540 --> 31:51.943
YOUR MOM'S WORKING ON BAIL.

31:57.282 --> 32:01.220
YOU KNOW, I FINALLY
LET MYSELF CUT LOOSE

32:01.252 --> 32:05.124
AND HAVE... A WORLD-CLASS
BACHELORETTE PARTY,

32:05.156 --> 32:07.192
AND I END UP IN JAIL.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.993
YOU'RE IN JAIL
BECAUSE OF ME.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.196
YEAH, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE REACHED
FOR THE COP'S NIGHTSTICK, BUT...

32:12.230 --> 32:14.932
THAT'S NOT THE STICK
I WAS REACHING FOR.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.372
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

32:20.405 --> 32:23.107
YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE?

32:26.377 --> 32:30.015
EVERY CHOICE
IS THE RIGHT ONE
WHEN YOU MAKE IT.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.252
-YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?
-(chuckles)

32:35.688 --> 32:38.423
I'VE LONG SINCE GIVEN UP
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

32:38.457 --> 32:40.392
WHY THINGS ARE
THEY WAY THEY ARE.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.162
IS THAT HELPING YOU GET OVER
THINGS WITH SAM?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.631
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU GUYS?

32:45.663 --> 32:48.599
OH, HONEY, SAM...
(scoffs)

32:50.301 --> 32:53.271
SAM WANTS TO TRAVEL,
SEE THE COUNTRY.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.174
HE WANTS TO SPEND
THE WINTER IN SEDONA.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.608
AND HE WANTS YOU
TO GO WITH HIM.

32:58.743 --> 33:01.313
AND I WANNA SPEND
THAT TIME WITH YOU.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.750
I CAN'T HAVE YOU...

33:04.982 --> 33:07.318
STAYING BECAUSE
YOU'RE AFRAID I MIGHT DIE.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.588
NOBODY IN THIS FAMILY IS
DYING ANY TIME SOON!

33:10.622 --> 33:12.156
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.292
DIDN'T YOU BASICALLY
JUST SAY THAT?

33:17.096 --> 33:19.597
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY LEAVE YOU?

33:19.631 --> 33:24.635
THE SAME WAY
I'M LEAVING THE ROOM
I LIVED IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

33:24.670 --> 33:28.339
AND... MARRY A GUY
I REALLY JUST MET.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.075
AND THE WAY I...

33:31.276 --> 33:33.311
I HOLD MY BREATH

33:33.345 --> 33:36.214
EVERY TIME THEY TEST
MY BLOOD AND...

33:36.248 --> 33:37.682
SCAN MY BODY.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.353
YOU JUST HOPE
AND YOU PRAY THAT...

33:44.390 --> 33:46.325
AND IF THE RESULTS ARE BAD...

33:46.357 --> 33:49.260
YOU TRY TO ACCEPT IT,
AND YOU GET BACK UP,

33:49.294 --> 33:52.064
BECAUSE... BECAUSE...

33:52.096 --> 33:53.699
BECAUSE THAT'S THE DEAL.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.470
THERE'S NO LAST HURRAH,
IS THERE?

33:58.503 --> 34:01.707
NO, EVERY DAY IS
THE LAST HURRAH.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.345
YOU HAVE TO GO.
YOU KNOW THAT.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.547
I DO.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.585
BUT NOT BEFORE YOUR WEDDING.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.057
AND I NEED TO MAKE A DECISION

34:20.092 --> 34:23.061
ABOUT WHAT MAY BE
THE ONLY BOOK I EVER WRITE.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.797
I THOUGHT YOU'D DECIDED.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.297
SO DID I.

34:27.331 --> 34:30.235
I CAN'T LET FEAR
GUIDE THAT DECISION.

34:31.302 --> 34:33.371
I KNOW WHAT
I REALLY WANNA WRITE.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.840
I THINK I ALWAYS HAVE.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.110
-(lock clicks)
-Man: LADIES, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.713
-(sighs)
-YOU READY?

34:42.780 --> 34:44.349
HELL YES.

34:46.617 --> 34:49.521
WHAT ARE
YOU EVEN SAYING?

34:49.554 --> 34:52.224
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE!

34:52.257 --> 34:54.659
VAL KILMER IS NOT
THE BEST BATMAN!

34:54.693 --> 34:57.161
-I LIKE WHAT I LIKE.
-PFFT!

34:57.195 --> 34:58.563
-(scoffs) NO WAY.
-OKAY.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.532
-IT'S CHRISTIAN BALE. COME ON.
-YEAH!

35:00.565 --> 35:02.668
-THE VOICE. THE SUIT.
-THERE YOU GO. UH-HUH.

35:02.701 --> 35:08.172
-MMM! THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT
HE IS TALKING ABOUT.
-MMM!

35:08.206 --> 35:11.777
-Both: MMM!
-OH, YOU TWO ARE TOO CUTE!

35:11.809 --> 35:13.344
-I GOTTA TAKE A PICTURE.
-OOH, YEAH.

35:13.378 --> 35:14.847
-OKAY.
-READY?

35:16.347 --> 35:17.583
(clicks)

35:17.615 --> 35:20.818
ADORABLE. OOH!
I'M GRAMMING THIS IMMEDIATELY.

35:20.853 --> 35:24.389
-TAG ME.
-HASHTAG... DOMINO.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.425
OOH! IT'S YOUR NAME,
IT'S MY NAME.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.329
I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT.
AND I LIKE YOU, DUDE.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.898
-(chuckles)
BACK AT YOU, DUDE.
-I DO.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.367
OH. YOU'RE NICE.
YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.505
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.
YOU'RE A HARMLESS GUY.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.773
HARMLESS, HUH?
THAT'S SOMETHING
EVERYONE LIKES TO HEAR.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.643
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I JUST MEAN, I WAS...

35:44.675 --> 35:47.378
I USED TO WORRY THAT
YOU WOULD STAY PISSED AT ME

35:47.411 --> 35:50.181
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING
WENT DOWN WITH APRIL.

35:50.215 --> 35:54.719
OR WORSE, THAT YOU WERE
GONNA SWOOP IN AND TRY
AND STEAL HER FROM ME.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.389
BUT THAT ALL SEEMS KINDA
CRAZY NOW, DOESN'T IT?

35:57.422 --> 36:00.458
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT  PHANTOM MENACE  WAS
THE BEST  STAR WARS.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.161
BUT YOU KNOW, I GET IT,
BECAUSE YOU AND APRIL
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

36:03.195 --> 36:08.599
AND WHAT'S GREAT,
DIMPLES-- DOM-- DOMPLES,

36:08.634 --> 36:11.637
IS THAT WE CAN
BE FRIENDS NOW,

36:11.670 --> 36:13.938
BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.775
-YOU DON'T WANT APRIL BACK.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.536

36:45.570 --> 36:49.440
YOU KNOW WHAT?
APRIL WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.
YOU ARE A NICE GUY.

36:49.474 --> 36:52.878

37:45.797 --> 37:48.599
-EVERYTHING OKAY?
-WHAT? SORRY.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.670
I'M MEETING WITH NINA LATER,
SO I'M JUST WORKING
ON SOME NOTES.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.871
-OH.
-HOW'D LAST NIGHT GO?

37:53.905 --> 37:56.507
YEAH, IT WAS--
IT WAS-- IT WAS FINE.

37:56.541 --> 37:59.677
I'M THINKING WE SHOULD
GO WITH A D.J., THOUGH.

37:59.710 --> 38:04.048
-OH, GRANDMA AND APRIL
GOT ARRESTED.
-(gasps) REALLY?

38:04.282 --> 38:08.586
OH, IT WAS JUST A LITTLE
HARASSING-AN-OFFICER THING.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.922
THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

38:10.956 --> 38:15.594
AND I GOT TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL TALK
WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.063
DID WE MISS ANYTHING BIG?

38:18.295 --> 38:21.599
ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.367
-CAN WE TALK?
-SURE.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.304
WELL, WELL.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.840
STRIPPERS, JAIL,

38:28.873 --> 38:31.076
MYSTERY TALKS.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.943
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU MISSED OUT, BREN.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.945
SOUNDS LIKE WE BOTH DID.
(chuckles)

38:40.851 --> 38:43.521
-WHAT'S THIS?
-IT'S A SUMMARY PAGE

38:43.554 --> 38:45.056
FOR THE BOOK I WANNA
WORK ON WITH YOU.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.025
IS THIS THE PROJECT
WE TALKED ABOUT?

38:47.059 --> 38:48.893
IT'S A PROPOSAL
FOR MY MEMOIR.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.766
LOOK, ANOTHER
20-SOMETHING GIRL MIGHT

38:54.800 --> 38:57.969
COME IN HERE AND HAND YOU
A MEMOIR ABOUT HER FIRSTS--

38:58.003 --> 39:00.505
HER FIRST JOB,
HER FIRST APARTMENT,

39:00.539 --> 39:02.039
HER FIRST HEARTBREAK.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.608
BUT I HAVE TO THINK
OF ALL OF THESE THINGS
AS MY LASTS.

39:04.643 --> 39:08.746
BEING SICK MAKES
EVERY DECISION I MAKE
SO ENORMOUS,

39:08.780 --> 39:10.949
BUT IT ALSO KEEPS ME
FROM TAKING ANYTHING
FOR GRANTED,

39:10.981 --> 39:12.650
AND I THINK THAT
THAT'S A PERSPECTIVE

39:12.684 --> 39:14.485
THAT WILL MAKE
MY WORK STAND OUT.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.755
I KNOW--
I KNOW YOU WERE EXCITED
ABOUT MY YOUNG ADULT IDEA.

39:17.789 --> 39:21.460
I WAS TOO.
I WISH I COULD WRITE IT.
I COULD WRITE EVERYTHING--

39:21.492 --> 39:25.931
Y.A., CHICK LIT, SCI-FI,
EVEN ONE OF THOSE
2,000 PAGE BIOGRAPHIES.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.400
I WANT TO DO
EVERYTHING, BUT...

39:29.434 --> 39:32.670
(sighs)
IF I ONLY GET
TO TELL ONE STORY,

39:32.704 --> 39:34.873
IT'S GOTTA BE MY STORY.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.976
WOW. THAT'S REALLY
BRAVE OF YOU,

39:38.009 --> 39:40.644
BUT PUBLISHING IS
A CHALLENGING BUSINESS.

39:40.679 --> 39:43.414
MORE SO THAN EVER.
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU--

39:43.447 --> 39:46.050
I'M LOOKING
TO WORK ON PROJECTS
WITH BROADER APPEAL.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.153
IF YOU WANT TO WRITE
YOUR MEMOIR, I WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.090
BUT YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO WORK WITH.

39:53.692 --> 39:54.893
I WILL.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.764
-(Finn whispering)
NO, I SWEAR, THEY REALLY DID.
-Boy: COME ON.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.634
-I'M NOT JOKING.
I'M SERIOUS.
-DUDE. DUDE.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.871
-WHEN WAS THIS?
-IT WAS...

40:05.903 --> 40:07.972
-NO WAY, MAN.
YOU'RE LYING.
-I SWEAR.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.974
-COME ON.
-THEY REALLY DID.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.911
OOH!

40:14.746 --> 40:17.916
HEY, FINN.
SO GLAD YOU CAME OVER.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.952
WOULD YOU GUYS
GIVE US A SECOND?

40:21.952 --> 40:23.722
(boys laugh)

40:26.023 --> 40:28.693
(both laugh)

40:29.728 --> 40:31.996
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
YOURSELF A FAN CLUB.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.865
OH, WHO NEEDS FRIENDS
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAN CLUB?

40:34.900 --> 40:38.103
-FRIENDS ARE OVERRATED.
-NO, HEY, HEY, YOU'VE GOT
A FRIEND.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.708
-PICKLE CHIP?
-HEY, THOSE BETTER
BE NEUTROPENIC.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.911
NEUTROPENIC AND DELICIOUS.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.681
SO DELICIOUS, AND IT'S WEIRD.
I USED TO HATE THESE THINGS,

40:49.713 --> 40:52.217
-BUT I LOVE THEM NOW,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.
-THANK YOU!

40:52.449 --> 40:55.019
-FORD THINKS THEY'RE GROSS.
-WELL, THEY ARE,

40:55.052 --> 40:57.688
-BUT THEY'RE SO GOOD.
-(laughs)

41:02.561 --> 41:06.197
-A MEMOIR, HUH? VERY COOL.
-April:  Yeah.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.099
I don't know what sort
of market's out there
for the story of April Carver,

41:09.134 --> 41:12.170
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.
THE MARKET IS NOT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

41:12.204 --> 41:15.472
I HAVE TO USE THIS TIME
TO WRITE THE BOOK
I HAVE TO WRITE.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.641
-I HOPE YOU LET ME READ IT.
- Of course.

41:17.675 --> 41:20.478
You've really been there
for me through all of this.

41:20.512 --> 41:21.713
I'M RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.648
CAN I TAKE YOU OUT
FOR AN OFFICIAL THANK-YOU LUNCH?

41:23.681 --> 41:25.182
UH...

41:27.751 --> 41:29.820
NOW'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.623
OKAY. WELL,
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

41:31.655 --> 41:34.592
ACTUALLY, LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING
TO BE BUSY FOR A WHILE

41:34.626 --> 41:37.829
WITH SOME STUFF
FOR MY HOUSE AND...

41:37.862 --> 41:40.197
Why don't I call you
when things clear up?

41:40.231 --> 41:43.534
OKAY, GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR STUFF.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.853
(sighs)

42:08.626 --> 42:12.130
(end theme music playing)
