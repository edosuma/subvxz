00:30.024 --> 00:31.127
Jake.

00:31.247 --> 00:33.673
So, I just had this weird thought.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.069
Well, that's normal.

00:35.146 --> 00:37.964
People always have weird
thoughts around campfires.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.664
Well, I don't know.

00:39.741 --> 00:42.030
Isn't it sort of strange that we keep pets?

00:42.107 --> 00:43.809
We kind of make them worship us.

00:43.886 --> 00:44.944
What?

00:45.023 --> 00:46.255
Nah.

00:46.383 --> 00:48.405
No, seriously. Think about it.

00:48.482 --> 00:52.411
We're their only source of food
and water and, like, tummy rubs.

00:52.563 --> 00:54.261
They basically have to love us.

00:54.338 --> 00:55.923
What's wrong with tummy rubs?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.665
Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great.

01:00.247 --> 01:02.621
That one star is so crazy.

01:02.756 --> 01:04.369
Look like it's vibrating.

01:04.634 --> 01:05.914
It's so cool.

01:05.991 --> 01:08.477
Wonder what it is.
A planet?

01:08.579 --> 01:11.082
Do people live there?
Are they friendly?

01:11.159 --> 01:12.708
Do they keep pets?

01:12.785 --> 01:16.917
All right, buddy.
That's a little too much campfire.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.011
Time for bed.

Holy...

01:41.684 --> 01:42.897
Oh, dang.

01:48.153 --> 01:50.844
Uh... Okay.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.468
Man, this is screwy.

01:54.089 --> 01:56.330
Maybe it's the can of
beans we had for dinner.

01:56.779 --> 02:00.846
Looks, uh... Homey.
Whu-oh.

02:03.174 --> 02:04.390
Oh, right.

02:04.888 --> 02:06.762
Mm. Boobafina.

02:06.839 --> 02:08.959
Uh, just pay me back
when you can.

02:09.036 --> 02:11.542
- Aww! Hello.
- Huh?!

02:11.619 --> 02:12.812
Oh, hey!

02:12.947 --> 02:15.619
- You can see me?
- See you...

02:15.696 --> 02:18.002
But if I didn't see you...

02:18.115 --> 02:20.811
Wait. What did you originally ask me?

02:20.972 --> 02:22.425
Aw, forget it. It's cool.

02:22.502 --> 02:25.326
Do you... Want a drink or something?

02:25.403 --> 02:28.631
- Think I only have water, anyway.
- Whoop! Here I go. Bye.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.244
Oh!
That was sort of rude.

02:31.321 --> 02:32.912
I hope he comes back.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.891
That guy seemed lonely.

02:35.085 --> 02:37.345
Not a lot of other foxes up at this hour.

02:37.422 --> 02:39.752
Guess you get a lot of work done, though.

02:42.994 --> 02:44.718
Quittin' time.

02:46.505 --> 02:50.584
You don't have to go home, but
you... You know how it goes.

02:50.661 --> 02:52.652
Bounce House Princess.

02:58.677 --> 03:01.805
I didn't know
B.H.P. lived in a cave.

03:09.046 --> 03:11.540
Hey, this place is pretty nice.

03:14.853 --> 03:19.508
- Whoa.
- 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,

03:19.585 --> 03:24.483
47, 48, 49, 50! 51, 52...

03:24.560 --> 03:26.324
Who's there?

03:31.832 --> 03:33.498
Oh, oh!
Oh, my glob!

03:33.575 --> 03:36.056
Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob,
oh, my glob, oh, my glob!

03:39.592 --> 03:41.459
Six, four, three, two.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.400
Dude, what's your deal?

03:50.538 --> 03:52.327
Everything's okay now.

03:54.051 --> 03:55.186
Aw, geez.

03:55.265 --> 03:57.068
Poor Bounce House Princess.

04:15.262 --> 04:17.377
Bounce House Princess,
you listen to me.

04:17.454 --> 04:20.141
Are you gonna shut yourself
off from other people forever?

04:20.218 --> 04:23.206
I mean, he or she could
be really nice and...

04:23.881 --> 04:27.719
Okay. M... maybe if I just
stay very still it'll just...

04:27.861 --> 04:30.412
it'll just go away.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.446
Gosh. I hope B.H.P.'s okay.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.578
Feel bad for just splittin' like that.

04:35.902 --> 04:37.509
Maybe they sorted it out.

04:37.586 --> 04:39.302
They could have stuff in common.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.682
You never know until
you speak to the person.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.624
Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.573
What the... Ice King?

04:54.988 --> 04:57.527
Yeah, I guess there's
some cool people here.

04:57.604 --> 05:00.819
Music's a little loud, but
the punch is top-drawer.

05:01.315 --> 05:04.345
Hey, you should come to
one of my parties sometime.

05:04.422 --> 05:07.318
I'm friends with some pretty
cool people, too, you know?

05:07.395 --> 05:09.466
Uh-huh. Who are your friends?

05:09.543 --> 05:10.634
Oh, uh,

05:10.754 --> 05:12.651
- like that guy Finn?
- Finn?

05:12.728 --> 05:15.422
Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight.

05:18.031 --> 05:20.146
Oh, hi. Are you the ice dude?

05:20.223 --> 05:22.334
That's me... ice dude.

05:22.437 --> 05:25.282
Say, have you ever seen the
inside of an ice-bear cave?

05:25.359 --> 05:27.521
Did you say you know Finn the human?

05:27.598 --> 05:28.924
Hey, buddy!

05:29.001 --> 05:31.209
Buddy,
care to freshen me up?

05:31.286 --> 05:32.798
Yeah, yeah, now scram.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.381
Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now?

05:35.458 --> 05:38.692
Could you introduce us?
Oh, my glob, is he here now?

05:38.769 --> 05:42.071
So I guess you're more into
the little-brother type, huh?

05:42.148 --> 05:45.134
Hey, Lauren. I heard your
grandpa's giving out ice.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.813
Ice?! I'll give you ice!

05:55.092 --> 05:58.365
Ah, looks like I put this party "on ice."

05:58.442 --> 06:00.477
No wait. "You want ice? You... oh,

06:00.554 --> 06:03.318
you got iced." Anyway. Ai!

06:03.448 --> 06:06.451
Aw, don't look at me like that, Lauren.

06:10.973 --> 06:13.553
Aw, this party was weak anyway.

06:15.465 --> 06:16.870
Poor Simon.

06:16.978 --> 06:19.386
Poor Simon, I guess?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.246
Poor Simon, sort of?

06:21.323 --> 06:24.214
It's like some part of him
wants to be a sad wong lord.

06:24.413 --> 06:26.359
But why would anyone want that?

06:26.503 --> 06:29.094
Is there some incentive?

06:29.851 --> 06:33.257

07:06.863 --> 07:08.384
Sheesh.

07:09.231 --> 07:11.083
I wonder
if being a sad loner gives you

07:11.160 --> 07:13.474
more raw materials
to form song ideas.

07:13.655 --> 07:15.572
Is that where creativity comes from?

07:15.699 --> 07:17.375
From sad biz?

07:17.542 --> 07:19.473
I am so high up now.

07:19.687 --> 07:21.943
I'm so high up there is no high up.

07:22.263 --> 07:23.941
It's all just...

07:27.656 --> 07:29.416
Space lards!

07:29.493 --> 07:32.148
Aw, man. Jake would be flipping out,

07:32.225 --> 07:34.337
trying to get that super-rare milk.

07:34.414 --> 07:37.315
Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well.

07:37.392 --> 07:39.904
Whoa. What's going on?

07:39.981 --> 07:41.646
You can't see me, right?

07:48.799 --> 07:52.062
I'm in the mother lard!

07:59.509 --> 08:02.883
What? Space birth.

08:04.258 --> 08:08.448
Whoa-kay. Here we go.
Whoa! Bye, guys.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.431
Well, that was creative,
and it wasn't sad, either.

08:11.508 --> 08:14.883
So maybe birth is the greatest
creative statement in all the universe.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.924
Hey, baby.

08:16.003 --> 08:17.514
You gonna give me
a boost?

08:25.424 --> 08:26.913
Here comes Mars.

08:26.990 --> 08:29.176
What the heck is going on,
though?

08:29.471 --> 08:31.567
Everybody's leaving.

08:31.898 --> 08:35.667
- Fire defense missiles.
- Missiles away.

08:36.006 --> 08:39.126
Impact with
catalyst comet in five, four,

08:39.203 --> 08:42.000
three, two, one...

08:42.077 --> 08:45.300
Yes.
Do you think it worked, Starman?

08:45.377 --> 08:47.356
Uh, yeah, probably, right?

08:47.824 --> 08:50.709
Shoot! No effect!
It's still coming right at us!

08:50.786 --> 08:52.385
Was that all of our missiles?

08:52.462 --> 08:55.235
Uh, yeah. I'm surprised we
even had those ones. Like,

08:55.312 --> 08:57.111
who would we
shoot a missile at?

08:57.230 --> 09:00.028
- Who would we shoot at?
- I'm thinking, Starman.

09:00.105 --> 09:02.559
- Whoops.
- Grob, assessment.

09:02.636 --> 09:03.794
We're sunk, bro.

09:03.871 --> 09:07.661
This whole place is gonna be a
stinking, molten dump in a minute.

09:07.738 --> 09:09.138
It doesn't make sense.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.121
Every 1,000 years,
the catalyst comet mysteriously

09:12.198 --> 09:14.255
reincarnates itself
and collides with Earth,

09:14.332 --> 09:16.057
bringing with it
an agent of change,

09:16.134 --> 09:18.291
but the comet's
never been so off schedule,

09:18.368 --> 09:20.151
and it's never
freaking hit Mars.

09:20.228 --> 09:22.701
- What do you think, Finn the human?
- What?

09:22.778 --> 09:25.061
Who? Me?
You can see me, too?

09:25.138 --> 09:28.205
- Yes. I am Glob.
- Oh, yeah.

09:28.282 --> 09:30.335
Hey, do you ever say, "oh, my" glob"?

09:30.412 --> 09:32.576
No, but sometimes gob does.

09:33.887 --> 09:35.794
You're dreaming
so far from home.

09:35.871 --> 09:38.326
- It must be comet-related.
- Yeah.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.719
- But I got a question.
- What's that?

09:40.796 --> 09:44.646
Well, if just being born is
the greatest act of creation,

09:44.723 --> 09:47.441
then what are you
supposed to do after that?

09:47.716 --> 09:50.810
Isn't everything that comes
next sort of a disappointment...

09:50.887 --> 09:54.422
slowly entropying until
we deflate into a pile of mush?

09:54.499 --> 09:58.195
Well, it's not enough to have
created something amazing, right?

09:58.272 --> 10:01.562
What if I just let my Martian
super-society go to butt?

10:01.639 --> 10:05.076
But what's it worth if we all
gonna get blowed up right now?

10:05.653 --> 10:07.903
Whoa!
What are you doing?!

10:20.716 --> 10:21.950
Oh, my blood!

10:22.027 --> 10:23.543
What is it, boy?

10:24.761 --> 10:26.386
Glob is dead.

10:28.266 --> 10:31.657
Hello, Starman.
This is Evacuation Man.

10:31.734 --> 10:32.798
What's the sitch?

10:32.875 --> 10:34.915
- Can we go back yet?
- Yes.

10:34.992 --> 10:37.476
Gob/Glob/Grod/Grob
diverted the comet.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.991
- It's back on its normal path to Earth.
- And...

10:40.068 --> 10:43.421
- What about the G-man?
- No sign of Glob.

10:51.274 --> 10:53.813
Computer! What did we hit?!

10:58.098 --> 11:00.224
Oh, for real plops.

11:01.585 --> 11:03.827
Hey, I think Bounce House
Princess needs our help.

11:03.904 --> 11:05.082
Let's do it.
