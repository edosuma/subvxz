at getting back on SWAT?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.959

Cabbage Patch Dolls,

08:45.002 --> 08:48.223
I used what I had available to
take him out to save the infant.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.052
It was necessary.Look, the LAPD SWAT manual
clearly states

08:51.095 --> 08:53.750
that a rifle-breaching grenade
is only to be used on doors,

08:53.794 --> 08:55.796
tempered glass and other
inanimate objects.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.798
Never on a person's body.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.539
Luca, come on. I mean,
I already had it loaded.Look, I don't care

08:59.582 --> 09:00.931
what they taught you down
in Long Beach, Street.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.629

Hey, Hondo?

09:37.054 --> 09:40.405
Why doesn't Luca
want me back on the team?

09:40.449 --> 09:43.452
Street, you got to remember,
Luca's third generation SWAT.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.628
He's got a family
legacy to protect.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.891
He's always had a rep for
being a tough evaluator.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.893
Yeah, I mean, I've heard
the horror stories

09:49.937 --> 09:51.634
from Chris and Tan about
how tough he was on them

09:51.678 --> 09:53.418
through training, but, I mean,

09:53.462 --> 09:55.246
he's just making it
his mission to find

09:55.290 --> 09:57.422
the smallest excuses
to make sure I fail.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.033
Okay, so what
are you thinking?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.600
What? Because Luca
is your buddy

10:00.643 --> 10:02.645
and you let him crash on
your couch for a few months,

10:02.689 --> 10:04.386
he's gonna let you cruise
through the academy?

10:04.429 --> 10:06.475
All I want is a fair shot.Street, listen.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.652
Me, Deacon, Chris, Tan,
we see both sides.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.785
Luca will never understand
why you're willing

10:11.828 --> 10:13.308
to risk getting
kicked off the team.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.919
Luca's worldview

10:15.963 --> 10:18.052
has been beaten into him since
he learned how to crawl.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.663
Now, I'll talk to him,
but in the meantime,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.491
you show up,
you play hard.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.058
Kick some ass.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.626
I will.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.672
L.A.'s diamond district. Over
a hundred licensed jewelers

10:29.716 --> 10:32.022
moving tens of millions of
dollars of rock every day.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.285
This crew has only struck
within these borders.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.809
They've been careful to keep
their exposure time limited

10:35.852 --> 10:37.375
to under four minutes.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.550
Typical response time
for an LAPD chopper

10:38.594 --> 10:40.552
to get on top of someone
is five.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.467
Right, so they choose parking
garages close to their targets.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.686
They ditch the getaway vehicles,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.079
switch them out for ones
in clean plates.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.515
And then, it's two minutes
in any direction

10:46.558 --> 10:48.517
to three major freeways
that run through downtown.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.692
LUCA:
Every truck they steal,

10:49.736 --> 10:51.346
they reinforce
the front and back

10:51.389 --> 10:52.564
by welding on steel plates.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.696
So these guys are
awesome at getting away,

10:53.740 --> 10:55.176
but how are they getting in?

10:55.219 --> 10:56.568
Most diamond dealers
use three alarms,

10:56.612 --> 10:58.353
alerting the police if
any one of them fail.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.834
But nowadays 99% of alarms
run on cell networks.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.792
And during all three robberies,
employees and guards

11:02.836 --> 11:04.402
reported a complete loss
of cell service

11:04.446 --> 11:06.143
right before they got hit
by this crew,

11:06.187 --> 11:08.493
which means they're using
military-grade cell jammers.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.452
If no alarms reach LAPD
dispatch, how are we gonna know

11:10.495 --> 11:12.193
which diamond brokers
are being jacked?

11:12.236 --> 11:15.544
I had the tech boys send us
some cellular monitors.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.546
These things read
how weak or strong

11:17.589 --> 11:19.243
a cell signal is in a building.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.984
We install one of those
in every broker in the district.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.682
That way there if the
cell service goes dark

11:22.725 --> 11:24.466
in any one of them...That's the one
the crew's hitting.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.598
Like a cellular trip wire.Exactly.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.776
All right, let's roll
out and set some traps.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.301
You got some new intel
on this crew?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.085
All three brokers
that were targeted

11:35.129 --> 11:37.392
have financial ties to Farbrek.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.524
L.A.'s Israeli Mafia?

11:39.568 --> 11:41.439
The one that supposedly
doesn't exist?

11:41.483 --> 11:42.963
You think think this crew

11:43.006 --> 11:44.616
is only stealing diamonds
that belong to Farbrek?

11:44.660 --> 11:47.445
All three brokers hired guards
from the same security company.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.317
Owned by Aviv Cohen.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.192
He's supposedly
Farbrek's top enforcer.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.499
I know. We crossed paths when
I worked organized crime.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.588
We were building a case
against the Russian mob,

11:59.631 --> 12:01.633
and Cohen gave us
a lot of help.
Yeah.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.114
He fed you intel on the Russians
to get rid of his competition.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.987
Nobody makes a move in the
district without Cohen knowing.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.076
By now, he's searching
for the same suspects we are.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.599
If he finds them...

12:10.642 --> 12:11.774
Judge, jury and executioner.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.515
Who knows what kind
of collateral damage.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.212
What do you want to do?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.475
Talk to him.
But Cohen's dangerous,

12:17.519 --> 12:21.001
so I wanted at least one person
here to know where I was going.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.443
[indistinct chatter]

12:30.662 --> 12:32.664
[Cohen speaking Hebrew]

12:45.416 --> 12:48.202
Jessica.Aviv.

12:48.245 --> 12:51.683
Coffee?
No, I have a rule.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.642
No caffeine after dark,
or I would never sleep.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.513
Of course.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.298
The diamond brokers
who were robbed.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.866
I know your bosses
control them.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.345
I also know
that you're responsible

13:01.389 --> 13:02.651
for their protection.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.218
That's why I always liked you.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.655
You don't waste time, do you?

13:06.698 --> 13:10.485
[chuckles] My firm has started
its own investigation.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.096
We, uh, we filed claims
with the insurance companies...

13:13.140 --> 13:15.446
I know. I requested copies.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.885
All three brokers
had only the minimum coverage.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.540
Total value of the stones
stolen so far, 11 million.

13:22.584 --> 13:25.630
Total payout from all three
policies, three million.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.371
Leaving eight million reasons

13:27.415 --> 13:29.025
why you want your hands
on this crew.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.506
I'm only doing
what's within our legal rights

13:31.549 --> 13:34.030
to get back what was taken
from our client.Here's a deal.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
If you find the suspects
before we do,

13:35.902 --> 13:38.556
you call me and SWAT
takes them into custody.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.298
So you get to hang
another plaque on your wall

13:41.342 --> 13:42.865
while our diamonds get stuck

13:42.909 --> 13:45.389
in the probate court
for God knows how long, right?Aviv.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.652
If you help me get this crew
off the street

13:47.696 --> 13:49.089
without any more bloodshed,

13:49.132 --> 13:51.743
I will hand-deliver those stones
to you myself.

13:51.787 --> 13:55.573
These thieves killed
and injured some of my men.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.924
All the more reason
to let me put them behind bars.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.969
How do I know
you're gonna keep your word?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.580
I kept my word to you last time,
and I will this time.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.626
In both our jobs,

14:04.669 --> 14:07.455
having a friend is much smarter
than making an enemy.

14:07.498 --> 14:08.848
[sighs]

14:14.331 --> 14:15.942
TAN:
Here we go.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.945
What you got?Black Dodge Ram.
Engine's running.

14:18.988 --> 14:22.252
License number 2-6-1-P-C-E.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.298
No, doesn't come up stolen.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.736
It's registered
to Eddie Alvarez, 71.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.045
TAN:
Yeah, the only target

14:32.088 --> 14:33.916
Eddie's after
is the half-chicken combo.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.483
CHRIS: Hondo, I
ran every pickup

14:35.526 --> 14:36.963
in the area, no red flags.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.965
You and Deac, uh, spot anything
where you're perched?

14:39.008 --> 14:40.967
HONDO [over radio]: Negative.
Just keep your eyes open.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.664
If this crew makes a move,

14:42.707 --> 14:44.971
we need to be on top
of them quick.Roger that.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.930
That PR girl you've been after,
you have date number three yet?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.672
We did. And, uh, she's not
in PR. She's in marketing.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.413
What's her name?
Like, K-Kiva? Keela?

14:52.456 --> 14:54.676
Kira.Kira. That name
just sounds sexy.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.940
She's that one with the vintage
record collection, right?

14:57.984 --> 15:00.203
You notice I haven't
said anything about her today?I thought you said

15:00.247 --> 15:01.726
she might be
serious girlfriend material.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.119
Yeah, I thought so, too, but...

15:03.163 --> 15:05.817
Sounds like Kira's lost
her sizzle. [chuckles]

15:23.618 --> 15:25.968
[tablet beeping]Hey, we've got
a complete signal loss

15:26.012 --> 15:27.404
at Durant Diamonds.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.710
Hondo, the crew's moving
on a broker.

15:28.753 --> 15:29.929
Seventh and Broadway.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.457
[gunshots]

15:45.814 --> 15:47.990
This is 20-David to Command.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.252
We are trading fire

15:49.296 --> 15:51.602
with four heavily armed
suspects.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.305
DEACON:
30-David to Command.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.263
Suspect vehicle
feeling the scene.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.700
A gray crew cab pickup
heading east on Broadway.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.616
Suspect sporting heavy armor!

16:06.791 --> 16:08.750
Cover me.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.711
DEACON:
If we can't

16:13.755 --> 16:15.757
pierce that armor,
he's not going down.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.907
Did Hondo just skip a bullet?

16:35.951 --> 16:37.866
TAN: To get a different angle
on the armor?

16:37.909 --> 16:39.781
Guys talk about doing it,
but I've never seen it.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.705
This is 20-David to Command.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.750
One suspect down.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.710
White female.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
It's hard to believe that's
the suspect who came at us

17:03.109 --> 17:04.197
with a machine gun.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.589
Adina Bagdalov.

17:05.633 --> 17:09.071
22-year-old Israeli national
here on a student visa.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.942
I thought Jews
weren't supposed to get tattoos?

17:10.986 --> 17:12.509
TAN: I knew this
Jewish cop in Vice

17:12.553 --> 17:14.120
who got full sleeve
tats. He was killed,

17:14.163 --> 17:16.035
and his parents couldn't
bury him in the family plot.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.949
Well, she didn't think twice
about mixing it up with us.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.125
I doubt she cared
what her parents thought.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.040
She handled
that SAW like a pro.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.345
Well, in Israel, it's mandatory
for all men and women

17:22.389 --> 17:24.347
to join the military
when they turn 18,

17:24.391 --> 17:26.219
so she had plenty of training.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.785
She was a college student?

17:27.829 --> 17:29.222
That's what it
says on her visa.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.702
She came here to study
biology at Northridge.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.965
Then a month ago, she dropped
out, then disappeared.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.229
She have any other family here?No, not stateside.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.491
I called the Israeli consulate.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.883
They're trying to
track down next of kin.

17:38.927 --> 17:42.365
The three suspects who got away,
they're also women?

17:50.808 --> 17:52.332
Dr. Hughes is sending

17:52.375 --> 17:55.117
the postincident psych review
for your file.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.988
You're clear for duty.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.555
The suspect,

17:58.599 --> 17:59.991
she was a young woman.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.037
Yeah. Surprised the hell
out of me, too.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.039
Are you okay?I'm fine, Jess. You know me.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.388
Not as much as I used to.

18:05.432 --> 18:08.870
How are things
with your new guy?David?

18:08.913 --> 18:10.350
Good.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.614
I met his family the other night
for the first time.

18:13.657 --> 18:16.138
I couldn't really tell
if they liked me.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.488
Oh, come on. Stop it.
I'm sure they loved you.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.664
I mean, he's got no
chance of treating you

18:20.708 --> 18:22.710
like the last guy, but, uh...

18:22.753 --> 18:24.973
maybe he'll come close.What about you?

18:25.016 --> 18:27.497
Is there any lucky girl
in your life?

18:27.541 --> 18:29.325
No one serious.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.200
Okay, now that we've ID'd
one of the suspects,

18:34.243 --> 18:36.376
let's start making connections
to the other three.

18:36.419 --> 18:39.205
We're already doing it.
And I'll keep you posted.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.337
Thanks for getting me
cleared for duty.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.565
JESSICA:
Street.

18:51.608 --> 18:55.090
What's this?Request for a new
LRAD sonic rifle.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.179
Somebody trashed ours.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.572
We're facing massive
budget cuts.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.139
I cannot put this
request through.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.141
I'm sorry.I mean, just explain

19:02.184 --> 19:04.752
to the city controller it's
a nonlethal acoustic device...

19:04.795 --> 19:06.275
A sound gun.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.321
Believe me, she'll see
it as a waste of money.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.323
She's already on me
about the 500 Tac Lights

19:10.366 --> 19:11.759
I got ordered by accident.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.108
I can return them.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.284
Refund might cover the cost
of a new LRAD.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.720
The vendor won't take them back.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.200
What if I knew someone

19:18.244 --> 19:19.854
that could take those
off our hands?

19:19.897 --> 19:22.117
You know someone
who wants to buy 500 Tac Lights?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.162
Maybe.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.033
Someone legal?

19:25.076 --> 19:26.556
Of course.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.297
Why does everyone always assume
the worst about me?

19:28.341 --> 19:31.692
Just make sure no one sees you
haul them out of here.

19:39.787 --> 19:43.312
[microwave beeps]

19:43.356 --> 19:46.359
You know, in all the years
we've worked together,

19:46.402 --> 19:48.404
I don't think I've ever
seen you use a microwave.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.103
Usually the beeping
means your food is done.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.891
[microwave opens, closes]

19:56.934 --> 19:58.893
You ever kill a woman?

20:02.026 --> 20:03.941
No, I have not.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.947
Neither have I. Till today.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.080
[sighs]
We engaged an armed suspect.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.778
Makes no difference
what gender they are.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.998
So why do I feel bad about it?

20:17.041 --> 20:19.000
Because, if you're like me,

20:19.043 --> 20:22.003
you probably hold on
to some notion of chivalry.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.613
Handed down to us
by the old-timers

20:23.657 --> 20:26.225
who taught us
the codes of the street.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.270
My mama always told me

20:28.314 --> 20:31.491
that you protect the
women and the kids.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.145
Unfortunately, that's not
the world we live in today.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.887
We got kids
shooting up movie theaters.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.194
Moms pulling pieces
on each other

20:39.238 --> 20:41.196
because someone stole
a parking spot at yoga class.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.112
I mean, maybe there was
a nonlethal scenario

20:44.155 --> 20:45.592
that I should've thought about.Like what?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.637
There was no other scenario.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.340
[exhales]

20:58.344 --> 21:00.346
Hondo.

21:04.959 --> 21:09.224
Look, laying out
on that coroner's slab,

21:09.268 --> 21:10.921
she looked
like the girl next door.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.619
But you didn't shoot a woman.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.185
You shot a killer.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.232
Thanks, Deac.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.502
CHRIS:
And when exactly did

21:26.546 --> 21:28.722
Adina move out
of your dorm?About a month ago.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.202
I came home from class,
and all her stuff was gone.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.161
I figured she got homesick
and went back to Israel.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.816
You didn't get any calls or
texts from her after that?No.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.383
We weren't very close.

21:37.426 --> 21:40.081
I mean, she was always
either in class or at the gym.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.343
She basically
lived there.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.736
She ever talk
about her family?

21:42.779 --> 21:44.346
They were aid workers
who got killed

21:44.390 --> 21:45.782
crossing the border in Israel.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.349
Adina say how they died?

21:47.393 --> 21:50.091
No. I figured it was terrorism.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.528
I mean, you know how
messed up it is over there.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.530
Did she have a boyfriend
or any other friends on campus?

21:54.574 --> 21:56.445
No, but she mentioned
she had a few friends

21:56.489 --> 21:58.360
from back home
who were also here on visas.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.275
In L.A.?
No idea.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.190
Just heard her talking on
the phone with them a few times.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.802
[siren blaring]

22:06.977 --> 22:08.936
[siren blaring,
honking]

22:10.111 --> 22:12.418
[tires squeaking]

22:12.461 --> 22:14.463
Real discreet.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.336
Hey, you're the one who wanted
to do this in broad daylight.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.384
All right.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.778
Like I said,

22:24.821 --> 22:26.997
ten grand worth of Tac Lights,

22:27.041 --> 22:28.521
brand-new, in the box.

22:28.564 --> 22:32.220
Sweet. Still got guys in
narcotics duct-taping Maglites

22:32.263 --> 22:34.265
to the end of
their shotguns.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.095
Sure your captain
okayed this?
Of course.

22:38.139 --> 22:42.404
Hey man, we're just two friendly
law enforcement agencies

22:42.448 --> 22:44.711
filling gaps
in our inventories.Translation--

22:44.754 --> 22:47.148
let's make this quick before
someone notices they're gone.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.541
Whoa!

22:48.584 --> 22:50.760
What happened to this LRAD?

22:50.804 --> 22:52.196
Sarge got drunk at
Novak's bachelor party

22:52.240 --> 22:53.894
and dropped it
in a hot tub.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.591
Pretty sure the
components still work.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.637
[sighs]
This is not a fair trade.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.685
So, you working the Armory.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.644
That mean you're
not SWAT anymore?

23:04.687 --> 23:06.472
Temporary budget thing.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.430
[chuckles]
Translation--

23:08.474 --> 23:10.432
you pissed off
the wrong people.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.565
That's the Jim Street
I know and love.

23:12.608 --> 23:16.264
Let's just say it's a, uh...

23:16.307 --> 23:19.267
to-be-continued situation.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.443
I had Customs search
their database

23:21.487 --> 23:23.053
for all Israeli females

23:23.097 --> 23:24.925
who entered the country
on student visas.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.883
Three women were flagged
for extending their visas

23:26.927 --> 23:29.059
and then disappearing, so
we dug a little deeper.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.931
These three women served
in the same unit

23:30.974 --> 23:34.108
in the Israeli Defense Force.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.502
Shoshonah Peretz.
She arrived four months ago,

23:36.545 --> 23:38.329
enrolled at Otis
School of Design,

23:38.373 --> 23:40.636
and then, six weeks ago, she
dropped out and vanished.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.943
HONDO:
Dania Ganz. Accepted
to Loyola Marymount

23:42.986 --> 23:45.336
for political science, and then,
a month ago, she was gone.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.861
Tori Kavev.
She got into Pepperdine.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.689
Three weeks ago,
she ghosted.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.778
Now, all three of
these women grew up

23:51.821 --> 23:54.345
in the same settlement
here, in Rimon.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.173
It's a stone's throw from
the Palestinian border.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.740
Okay, I'm a believer.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.350
According
to Israeli border police,

23:59.394 --> 24:01.004
each of the girls had
at least one parent murdered

24:01.048 --> 24:03.398
who worked for a group by the
name of the Segol Foundation.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.226
The Jewish charity here in L.A.?

24:05.269 --> 24:07.054
Yeah, the foundation funds
the entire settlement

24:07.097 --> 24:08.229
and employs
everyone in it.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.013
And the border
police suspect

24:10.057 --> 24:11.362
that these girls' parents
were murdered for something

24:11.406 --> 24:13.277
they were trying
to smuggle over the border.

24:13.321 --> 24:16.629
Uncut diamonds.I called a friend
in Financial Crimes.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.979
He suspects that the
Segol Foundation is linked

24:19.022 --> 24:21.242
to Farbrek somehow, who uses the
charity to launder dirty money,

24:21.285 --> 24:23.244
but no one's ever
been able to prove it.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.855
This is about diamonds,
but it's also about revenge.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.249
Customs have any idea where
to find these girls?

24:28.292 --> 24:30.860
No, but even armed robbers
like to post to social media.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.819
These are the last pics
that she posted

24:32.862 --> 24:34.211
before scrubbing the account,

24:34.255 --> 24:35.865
about a month before
the robberies started.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.215
And that is Nicholas Darby.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.652
He and Shoshonah were enrolled

24:39.695 --> 24:41.218
in the same class.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.264
Deac, get the team
ready to roll.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.962
Did Cohen tell you

24:46.006 --> 24:48.095
about Farbrek's connection
to all of this?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.489
Nope, he left
that part out.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.499
Aviv?

25:02.544 --> 25:05.504
Shouldn't make a habit
of being seen together, Jessica.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.291
Why are you showing me this?

25:10.334 --> 25:12.728
She and her army buddies
are the ones ripping you off.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.643
But you already
knew that.

25:14.687 --> 25:18.168
Your bosses trick settlers into
smuggling diamonds into Israel,

25:18.212 --> 25:20.562
telling them the profits
support the homelands.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.522
It's not illegal to support
a worthy cause, or is it?

25:23.565 --> 25:25.393
Once those diamonds
arrived in L.A.,

25:25.436 --> 25:27.526
your bosses cover their tracks
by killing those girls' parents.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.353
Do you have anything
to do with that?

25:29.397 --> 25:30.920
Okay, here's the truth.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.356
I've never even been
to Israel, okay?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.358
I'm a horrible Jew.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.447
But your bosses did order
you to kill these young women

25:36.491 --> 25:37.753
if you find them
first, didn't they?

25:44.499 --> 25:47.589
If I find them,
I'll call you.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.244
Hate to lose a friend.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.637
If they turn up dead,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.508
you'll lose more
than just a friend.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.857
Bye, Jessica.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.559
[beeping]

26:04.258 --> 26:06.260
[distant door opens]

26:32.155 --> 26:34.505
Shosh, wh-what are you doing?
What are you doing with a gun?

26:34.549 --> 26:37.421
Metro SWAT! Get down![rapid gunfire, glass breaking]

26:37.465 --> 26:39.510
Deacon, Luca, cover the roof.LUCA:
Down, down!

26:39.554 --> 26:41.295
HONDO: Go! Tan, you're
with me! Move! Move!

26:41.338 --> 26:43.297
Down! Go!
Yeah, yeah.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.820
CHRIS:
Hands behind your back.I don't think...

26:44.864 --> 26:47.083
CHRIS: Hands behind your back!Okay.
Go!

26:47.127 --> 26:49.303
[panting]

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
Drop your weapon!

26:54.700 --> 26:56.876
[rapid gunfire]

26:58.181 --> 26:59.792
Suspect's coming your way!

27:01.010 --> 27:03.404
Drop the weapon!

27:09.105 --> 27:10.541
[gunshot]

27:16.286 --> 27:17.461
Hondo, suspect's going
for the one-side!

27:25.252 --> 27:27.428
Shoshonah, don't move.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.825
Don't do it.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.177
The glass!

27:37.220 --> 27:38.831
[Shoshonah grunts,
thudding]

27:38.874 --> 27:40.920
[glass clinking]

27:42.269 --> 27:43.618
[panting]

27:51.931 --> 27:53.715
You took quite a spill.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.109
You're lucky
you didn't slice an artery.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.154
You're the one
that killed my friend?

27:59.112 --> 28:00.983
DEACON:
You got one
hell of a crew.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.985
You know, most of the men
that we chase--

28:03.029 --> 28:04.726
they aren't half as tough
as you and your friends.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.207
But it's over, Shoshonah.
Unless your pals

28:07.250 --> 28:11.037
are on a suicide mission,
there's only one play here.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.261
HONDO:
All four of you
got the same tats?

28:18.305 --> 28:20.220
Part of our pact.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.917
"Never again"--
what does that mean?

28:21.961 --> 28:24.006
We refuse to be victims twice.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.534
That's your parents.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.623
We know Farbrek's

28:32.667 --> 28:34.713
responsible for their deaths.DEACON:
We also know that through

28:34.756 --> 28:36.192
the charity they control
that they forced your parents

28:36.236 --> 28:38.107
to smuggle blood
diamonds into Israel,

28:38.151 --> 28:40.327
promised them that the profits
would go to new settlements,

28:40.370 --> 28:42.198
and then repaid them with
bullets to the head.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.113
HONDO:
I don't want any more of
your friends to end up

28:44.157 --> 28:46.768
in the morgue like Adina.
Now, is that what you want?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.204
DEACON:
Family and friends
is important to you.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.902
But Shoshonah,
your silence--

28:49.945 --> 28:51.381
it's actually putting
your friends in danger.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.601
They're safe from you,
aren't they?

28:53.644 --> 28:56.038
The LAPD is not who you
need to be worried about.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.953
If Cohen and his men
get to them first,

28:57.997 --> 28:59.955
you know the torture
he'll put them through.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.783
DEACON:
If you truly
love your friends,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.393
you'll help us save them.

29:03.437 --> 29:07.223
And I promise you, we will
bring them in unharmed,

29:07.267 --> 29:11.097
and your story
will be heard.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.971
You're fixing it, huh?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.712
Uh-huh.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.063
I can't believe
Luca ran over it.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.152
What?

29:23.196 --> 29:25.067
He told me that...

29:25.111 --> 29:27.504
Wow.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
By the way,
if you're, uh,

29:31.857 --> 29:34.860
here to beg me to rejoin
the team, you're too late.

29:34.903 --> 29:37.210
I've realized
that my true calling is

29:37.253 --> 29:39.429
drying out circuit boards and

29:39.473 --> 29:41.475
watching everybody else
get to do all the cool stuff.

29:41.518 --> 29:44.695
Actually, I'm-I'm...

29:44.739 --> 29:47.133
I'm here for advice.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.048
Not sure why,

29:49.091 --> 29:51.224
considering the disaster
you call your love life.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.835
Well, you've been
my sounding board

29:53.879 --> 29:55.402
for all of my
romantic misadventures.

29:55.445 --> 29:58.666
I'd be honored
to return the favor.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.843
Okay, but when I tell you this,
can you please promise me

30:01.887 --> 30:06.065
you're not gonna spiral
into some juvenile sex fantasy?

30:06.108 --> 30:08.154
Sure.
It's about Kira.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.199
The marketing girl
with the rad vinyl collection?

30:10.243 --> 30:14.725
It turns out she has a
fiancé, a guy, and they...

30:14.769 --> 30:16.292
they want to recruit
me into being a part

30:16.336 --> 30:18.033
of their relationship.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.905
Let me get this straight.[inhales and exhales loudly]

30:19.948 --> 30:22.821
So, you're into Kira,
but she's engaged to a dude,

30:22.864 --> 30:25.911
and they-they both
want to date you?
I know.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.087
It's, uh... different.
Mm.

30:28.130 --> 30:30.654
I don't even know
if I want to meet him.Well, I do.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.613
I mean, any guy who's planning
a wedding with his bride-to-be

30:32.656 --> 30:35.094
while also lining up a second
hottie for a roll in the hay

30:35.137 --> 30:37.661
with his fiancée's
blessing...
Street!

30:37.705 --> 30:39.620
Spiraling.
Sorry.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.404
So, what about Kira?

30:41.448 --> 30:43.015
Do you really like her?Yeah.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.843
She's funny, she's smart.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.627
Chemistry is crazy.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.108
I honestly thought
I found someone

30:49.151 --> 30:50.805
I wanted to get serious with,

30:50.849 --> 30:53.590
but I can't do this...
polyamorous thing.

30:53.634 --> 30:56.419
Okay, I'll bite. Why not?

30:56.463 --> 31:00.423
Okay, one-- that's not
what I'm looking for.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.382
Two-- you've met my family.

31:02.425 --> 31:05.994
And as much as they love me,
it took them a long time

31:06.038 --> 31:08.127
to even accept
that I was bisexual.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.172
I can't imagine how they'd react

31:10.216 --> 31:13.175
if I brought a man anda woman
home for Christmas.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.350
[laughing]:
Yeah.

31:14.394 --> 31:16.178
[sniffs]

31:16.222 --> 31:19.529
You know what I've loved about
you since the first day we met?

31:19.573 --> 31:22.228
You don't give a damn
what anyone thinks.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.925
You're just you.

31:23.969 --> 31:28.408
Yeah, but being a third wheel
in a "throuple?"

31:28.451 --> 31:30.323
I mean, you wouldn't
be standing here

31:30.366 --> 31:32.542
talking to me if
you weren't at least

31:32.586 --> 31:36.242
tempted to be in a...
"throuple?" Is that...?

31:36.285 --> 31:38.244
That's what
we're calling it?
[laughs]

31:38.287 --> 31:41.247
Yeah. Whatever.I mean, who knows?

31:41.290 --> 31:43.945
They could be the
loves of your life.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.904
You should just do
what you want to do.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.949
Don't worry about what
anyone else thinks.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.951
Thanks.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.127
And I'm... I'm sorry.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.564
I didn't mean to, um, call
your relationships "disasters."

31:54.608 --> 31:58.307
[chuckles]
Well, they are, so...

31:58.351 --> 31:59.700
Maybe I just haven't met
the right couple yet.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.267
[chuckles]

32:01.310 --> 32:02.790
Here.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.924
This belongs in Black Betty.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.234
Gollen Precious Metals.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.106
Shoshonah told us this was
the next broker they're hitting.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.672
Only two of them now.
You think they'll still

32:15.716 --> 32:17.326
go through with it?They made a pact to steal back

32:17.370 --> 32:19.894
every single stone their
parents died for, bringing

32:19.938 --> 32:21.548
at least some restitution
to their families back home.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.332
Yeah, and from what
we've seen so far,

32:23.376 --> 32:26.292
even just two of these women,
lethal enough to pull it off.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.250
We know they'll shoot it out
before just giving up.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.252
Let's go. They're
hitting it at 4:00.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.298
We'll be there at 2:00.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.636
Any second now.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.176
[gasps]

33:26.917 --> 33:29.442
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.052
[grunts]

33:35.926 --> 33:37.624
They're here.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.495
Hondo, I have eyes on Cohen.

33:39.539 --> 33:42.020
Moving heavy with back-up
to the real target.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.760
Shoshonah fed us a diversion.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.153
Captain, what's your 20?

33:45.197 --> 33:47.373
Sixth and Broadway.
L.C.J. Metals.

33:47.416 --> 33:48.809
Roger that.
We're headed to you now.

33:50.419 --> 33:53.770
Stop and lay down your weapons.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.598
I said lay down your weapons.

34:02.344 --> 34:05.130
Where's our diamonds?They came last night.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.262
put them in the floor.Show us.

34:07.306 --> 34:09.308
Lay down your weapons.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.532
COHEN:
Your suspects,

34:16.576 --> 34:17.794
they're, uh, they're inside.

34:17.838 --> 34:18.882
I don't give third warnings

34:18.926 --> 34:20.014
and I don't shoot to wound.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.233
Jessica.
Aviv.

34:21.276 --> 34:24.323
Okay. Okay.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.632
Start walking.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.634
[siren approaching]

34:42.341 --> 34:43.516
Captain, you good?

34:43.559 --> 34:44.734
Yeah.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.954
[rapid gunfire]Cover! Cover!

34:46.997 --> 34:51.219
Luca. Smokes, strobes, noise--
whatever barricade gear we got.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.624
DANIA: Open it!MANAGER: I-I don't have
the combination.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.234
LAPD! Drop your weapons!

35:06.278 --> 35:08.106
LAPD has the place surrounded.
You got nowhere else to run.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.846
[rapid gunfire]

35:12.197 --> 35:13.589
[grunts]

35:13.633 --> 35:14.982
HONDO:
Move, move!

35:16.853 --> 35:18.812
Sir, come with me.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.902
[chuckles]

35:24.209 --> 35:25.862
Anyone clock how much
ammo they had?They've gone through

35:25.906 --> 35:27.777
a mag each already.They can't have much more.

35:27.821 --> 35:28.865
Yeah, well, it
only takes one.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.302
[grunts]

35:30.345 --> 35:32.217
HONDO:
Dania! Tori! Look,
we know why you're here,

35:32.260 --> 35:34.393
and we know what happened
to your parents.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.482
Enough people have died over
these rocks!

35:36.525 --> 35:37.657
Let's end this right now.

35:42.270 --> 35:43.228
Is that thing charged?

35:43.271 --> 35:44.316
All the way.

35:44.359 --> 35:45.752
Ears.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.537
Luca, move, move.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.712
Got it cranked to ten.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.149
[high-pitched sound shrilling]

35:51.192 --> 35:53.107
[screaming]

35:54.543 --> 35:57.155
[grunts][screams]

36:02.377 --> 36:03.335
LUCA: Suspects down!DEACON: Move, move, move!

36:03.378 --> 36:04.684
LUCA:
Go, go!

36:04.727 --> 36:07.426
Hands up! Don't move!

36:07.469 --> 36:10.168
[Dania and Tori panting]

36:12.039 --> 36:13.823
JESSICA: What happened to my phone call?

36:13.867 --> 36:15.651
To working with me?

36:15.695 --> 36:17.871
I have bosses, Jessica,
same as you.

36:17.914 --> 36:20.265
I don't question their orders,
I just carry them out.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.354
We recovered the diamonds.
Every stone.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.791
If you kept your word,
I would be handing them over

36:24.834 --> 36:27.228
to you right now.Okay, so let's try
and salvage our deal.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.709
You got a deal when I let you
walk away the first time.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.798
You should be sitting
in prison right now.

36:31.841 --> 36:35.236
But I'm not. Because one day you
know you're gonna need me again.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.064
I sent a copy over
to Organized Crime.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.197
They've been circling
Farbrek for years.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.024
Looks like a list
of names of people

36:41.068 --> 36:43.157
of people who like donating
to charity.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.941
Yeah, but I'm sure it won't
take long for them to match

36:44.985 --> 36:48.075
the names on that list to the
blood diamonds they belong to.

36:48.118 --> 36:52.035
Jessica, you don't have
to do this.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.864
Aviv, I told you.
In our line of work

36:54.908 --> 36:57.650
you need every friend
you can get.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.218
And you just lost
your best one.
Jessica...

37:02.220 --> 37:04.918
[sighs]

37:04.961 --> 37:07.964
Man, my ears
are still ringing.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.488
What'd you say?

37:09.531 --> 37:11.533
[both laugh]

37:13.274 --> 37:18.018
You know, we all...
obsess over our losses,

37:18.061 --> 37:21.891
but we never
celebrate the wins.

37:21.935 --> 37:25.286
Two months ago. A hostage
barricade on the 101.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.854
Meth-head from Carson,
kidnapped his ex-girlfriend,

37:27.897 --> 37:29.638
he tried to get her to jump into
the river. You remember?

37:29.682 --> 37:32.293
Oh, yeah, we had to shut down
the freeway for over two hours.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.164
We had a lot of pissed off
commuters that day.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.123
The ex-girlfriend,
you remember her?

37:36.166 --> 37:38.821
Yeah, yeah.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.301
Nina. Nina Dorin.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.782
33. Worked the deli counter
at Von's,

37:42.825 --> 37:44.827
trying to take care of two kids
on minimum wage.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.742
All while being stalked
by her tweaker ex.

37:46.786 --> 37:50.311
He tried to kill her
and you saved her life.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.183
Yeah.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.841
You know... [sighs]

37:58.885 --> 38:00.234
I-I get why we hold on

38:00.278 --> 38:01.801
to the bad things that
we have to do, but...

38:01.844 --> 38:04.282
but hold on
to the good things, too.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.637
Moscow Mule, right?

38:11.680 --> 38:13.073
You're not on call or anything?CHRIS: Nope.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.988
She did tell you everything.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.033
TY: Kira couldn't stop talking
about you,

38:17.077 --> 38:18.426
even after you told her off.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.210
Maybe because you did
tell her off.

38:20.254 --> 38:23.039
[chuckles] Not a fan
of our vetting process.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.824
Right. Sorry.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.956
We've just found that easing
into that conversation

38:27.000 --> 38:29.089
is sometimes easier
after you know one of us.

38:29.132 --> 38:31.352
Yeah, I'm, uh, still trying

38:31.396 --> 38:33.833
to wrap my head around
all of this.TY: Right.

38:33.876 --> 38:38.838
What exactly would I be
to the two of you?

38:38.881 --> 38:42.363
Well, there's a physical aspect,
of course.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.147
We can have a lot of fun.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.107
But, uh, ultimately,

38:47.150 --> 38:49.457
it's about so much more
than sex for us.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.285
We're interested in
a real partner,

38:51.329 --> 38:53.896
the whole package.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.030
And if I decide to do this...
what are the rules?

38:57.073 --> 38:58.901
Mm.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.077
Okay, uh, well.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.210
In the beginning,
if we plan dates

39:03.253 --> 39:05.168
it's never between
just two of us.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.648
Initially,
it's all about the trio.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.084
Over time, we're
gonna develop

39:08.128 --> 39:09.521
different dynamics
with each other.

39:09.564 --> 39:10.522
We're not the same person,

39:10.565 --> 39:11.871
so we're not all gonna have

39:11.914 --> 39:13.786
the same relationship.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.875
Another rule is
don't keep score.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.659
Mm.
Like, "I slept
with him twice,

39:17.703 --> 39:19.139
she needs to sleep
with me twice."

39:19.182 --> 39:21.446
Just let things be
what they are.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.099
Don't over-think it.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.798
And if you ever feel left out,
you just ask for what you need.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.103
We don't read minds.

39:27.147 --> 39:28.496
KIRA: And if anyone
is feeling jealous,

39:28.540 --> 39:30.803
just say so,

39:30.846 --> 39:32.587
and we'll figure out
a way to rebalance.

39:32.631 --> 39:36.199
TY: This only works if we all
feel secure and valued.

39:36.243 --> 39:39.420
Open and honest communication,
it's key, our Golden Rule.

39:41.117 --> 39:42.423
So what else
do you want to know?

39:47.733 --> 39:50.431
LUCA:
Talked to Hondo.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.390
Never pegged you as the
"run to teacher" type.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.304
Luca, come on.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.959
Don't tell me you haven't
seen me giving 110% out there,

39:57.003 --> 39:59.832
but all you do is you dress me
down, you dock me points...

39:59.875 --> 40:01.137
Look, I'm taking my job as

40:01.181 --> 40:03.009
a SWAT candidate evaluator
seriously.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.184
Be honest with me.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.055
Me going through the academy,

40:06.099 --> 40:07.927
am I just wasting my time?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.755
You want honest?
Yeah.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.191
If it were up to me, you would
not be in the academy.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.193
Okay? You had your spot,
you had a spot

40:13.236 --> 40:14.803
that a hundred guys
would kill for

40:14.847 --> 40:16.370
and you threw it away.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.198
You're right.

40:18.241 --> 40:21.201
But I'm not like
you, Luca, okay?

40:21.244 --> 40:22.768
I didn't have a family
to teach me

40:22.811 --> 40:24.552
what it means to be a part
of something special.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.206
I had to figure that out myself.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.164
And I only did when I lost it.

40:31.864 --> 40:36.172
Look, you've got more natural
talent and intuition for this

40:36.216 --> 40:38.131
than guys with decades
on the job.

40:38.174 --> 40:42.831
But this is more
than a job, it's a life.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.920
And you can't take shortcuts.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.226
I'm trying.

40:46.269 --> 40:49.359
Seriously, I am trying.

40:51.797 --> 40:53.668
All right, small arms training
tomorrow, 0500.

40:53.712 --> 40:57.106
If I was you, I'd finish up
here, hit the sack.
All right.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.586
That LRAD came in handy today.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.370
I never thought you'd actually
find the part to fix it.

41:00.414 --> 41:02.938
Try not to run
over it again.

Oh, come on, Momma,
don't say it. Don't say it.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.777
Well, make me a damn
