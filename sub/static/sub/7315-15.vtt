WEBVTT

00:04.704 --> 00:06.772
(horns honking,
traffic sounds)

00:09.109 --> 00:11.010
So, I guess
this is it?

00:11.012 --> 00:12.745
It's been nice knowing you, man.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.314
Here we go.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.123
Hard to believe
we're already seniors.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.225
Yeah, remember the first
time we came up here?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.394
We were so young--

00:28.396 --> 00:31.363
Believed everything
would always go our way.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.265
Can I tell you something, chris?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.768
Look, don't make this
any harder, chris, all right?

00:35.770 --> 00:38.203
I already know you didn't get
into georgetown with me.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.339
I got into northern.

00:40.341 --> 00:43.042
Hey, that's not bad,
I mean...

00:43.044 --> 00:45.310
Wait, what?

00:45.312 --> 00:47.446
Northern was my first choice.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.314
They have a top
pharmacy program.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.382
I know.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.151
But you're a marketing major.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.419
See, this is why I waited
to tell you.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.521
You said you didn't
even apply there, dude.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.624
I mean, when the hell did we
start lying to each other?

00:58.626 --> 01:01.693
(grunts)

01:01.695 --> 01:04.296
(both laughing)

01:04.298 --> 01:06.432
(tires screeching,
metallic crashing)

01:06.434 --> 01:08.600
What was that?

01:12.305 --> 01:14.373
No way.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.842
Whoa.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.775
(grunts)

01:49.777 --> 01:51.477
(groaning)

01:55.348 --> 01:56.315
(cries out)

01:58.418 --> 01:59.418
Ooh.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.625
Let's go again.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.393
I know I can get
a better score.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.429
Your fletc agent training--

02:10.431 --> 02:12.631
It's not going to
be a competition.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.533
Of course, but practice
makes perfect, right?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.435
Come on, one more round?

02:16.437 --> 02:17.870
Not today.
(sighs)

02:19.806 --> 02:21.473
You looking for a gold star?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.742
They have those?
Nope.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.412
He used to have the top score
in every training category.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.214
Still would if they hadn't
changed to a point-based system.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.349
(chuckles)

02:30.351 --> 02:31.583
Bell curve anyone? Hello?

02:31.585 --> 02:32.851
Tony:
Hello.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.386
How does it feel
to be a federal agent?

02:34.388 --> 02:35.821
Well, I'll feel better

02:35.823 --> 02:37.356
When I get my fletc
training done.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.690
The sequestration last year

02:38.692 --> 02:40.392
Delayed a lot of people
ahead of me.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.861
Took me a week just to get
an instructor to qualify me

02:42.863 --> 02:44.530
On the firing range.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.198
And I suppose you aced that?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.733
Well, they gave me a gun.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.535
So, what are you guys
doing here?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.303
Couldn't miss out on

02:51.305 --> 02:54.273
Some sweaty
woman-on-woman action, huh?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.575
No. Although it does save mcgee
a pay-per-view charge.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.944
We got a crime scene.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.546
Oh, okay, um, cool.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.648
Let me just shower
and I'll be right back.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.649
No, no time.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.750
Gibbs is in the car.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.351
We cracked a window.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.653
Uh, gibbs wants me

03:07.655 --> 03:09.288
In my sweaty old sweatpants?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.956
He wants you in that.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.660
Let's go, probie.

03:17.463 --> 03:21.466
Mcgee: Well, a passing driver
called in the wreck.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.634
Metro called us
when they found the cargo.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.369
Rifles are civilian.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.972
These aren't.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.707
Property
of the u.S. Marine corps.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.610
I'm guessing these
aren't bread rations.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.545
The bakery closed down
two years ago.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.980
Went out of business.

03:34.982 --> 03:35.981
Truck's not registered.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.950
And the driver's
long gone.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.551
Stolen marine crates?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.253
I'd get my hot cross buns
out of here, too.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.255
No, they had to have
left something behind.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.556
It's likely.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.858
We will definitely
check on that.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.694
Then go, do it.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.697
Probie!
Probie!

03:51.699 --> 03:52.698
You know, when we call,

03:52.700 --> 03:53.999
It usually means

03:54.001 --> 03:55.601
You come to us.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.672
At first, "probie" sounded
endearing and cute.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.908
Doesn't anymore.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.643
Missing driver, go.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.779
He was a disgusting slob
who lived in his truck.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.348
I found his dirty clothes,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.783
His dirty mattress,

04:11.785 --> 04:14.620
And his dirty, dirty porn.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.455
This is all part

04:16.457 --> 04:17.723
Of the rookie hazing thing, huh?

04:17.725 --> 04:18.724
It's not hazing.

04:18.726 --> 04:19.758
It's part of the job.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.593
Driver?
Um...

04:21.595 --> 04:22.928
I found blood
on the steering wheel,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.364
And what looks like blue paint

04:25.366 --> 04:26.665
On the broken windshield.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.267
All that studying paid off.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.802
Bell curve or not.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.437
What about those buckets?

04:32.439 --> 04:33.605
When I said

04:33.607 --> 04:36.008
He lived in his truck,

04:36.010 --> 04:37.643
It wasn't hyperbole.

04:37.645 --> 04:41.513
Huh, our missing driver
was not a fan of pit stops.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.948
Did you check them?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.483
Ha.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.518
Mm, for what?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.753
Contraband.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.920
It's the first place I'd hide

04:48.922 --> 04:50.489
Something I didn't want found.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.823
Hmm.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.824
I wish that didn't make sense.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.993
Hey!

04:54.995 --> 04:56.628
You missed something in there.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.631
Grading on a curve
hurts everyone.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.700
You want me to squeeze
all the way down there?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.669
You'd have to dangle me
by my ankles!

05:10.910 --> 05:14.379
Hey, boss, I think I found
the cause of the crash.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.049
Spray paint-- matches spatter
found on the windshield.

05:17.051 --> 05:20.319
Yeah, well,
maybe the sky was falling.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.553
Yeah.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.422
Deliberately?

05:23.424 --> 05:25.691
I don't know. Good question.

05:25.693 --> 05:29.594
Well, deliberately or not,
what are the cosmic chances

05:29.596 --> 05:31.763
Of a random bag
hitting a bakery truck

05:31.765 --> 05:35.734
That's hauling
stolen marine rifles?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.704
Well, not weapons.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.606
It's armor.

05:41.608 --> 05:42.741
Lots of it.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.511
Missing the nsn.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.714
Yeah, this one is, too.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.384
All of them.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.489
Pretty fast, abbs.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.959
I don't like guns, gibbs.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.728
Matter of fact, I hate them.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.563
Which is a strong word.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.797
But I am a professional, so...

06:05.799 --> 06:07.366
Your handiwork?

06:07.368 --> 06:09.034
Yeah, whenever
the marines accept

06:09.036 --> 06:10.569
Equipment from a manufacturer,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.671
It's stamped
with a national stock number

06:12.673 --> 06:14.573
For safety
and logistic reasons.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.675
All the vests in the truck
were missing them.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.577
Which means they never made it
to uncle sam.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.546
Or they were never meant to
in the first place.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.681
So, you tested to see
if they're fake?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.716
Yes, and my tests
revealed something

06:24.718 --> 06:26.151
Way worse.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.719
This is official

06:27.721 --> 06:28.754
Marine-issued body armor.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.755
When worn properly,

06:29.757 --> 06:32.023
It can stop a 30-caliber

06:32.025 --> 06:35.460
Armor-piercing round with only
an occasional broken rib.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.596
This vest is from the truck.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.031
Looks like the real deal.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.033
Well, it is except...

06:42.035 --> 06:44.703
When this is hit,
the ceramic plates,

06:44.705 --> 06:46.605
They shatter into deadly shards

06:46.607 --> 06:48.140
That bury themselves
inside the body.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.846
The vests are faulty.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.615
They're more like fatal, gibbs.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.818
And apparently someone
is trying to sell these.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.596
Okeydoke.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.566
Body armor manufacturers.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.435
Let me guess.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.770
The two with dod contracts
deny making faulty vests.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.839
They're sending representatives
just in case.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.007
Hmm.
Mcgee: No, that's not
what I mean.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.475
I'm saying it doesn't matter

07:23.477 --> 07:24.476
To anyone here.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.911
Delilah.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.679
Look, when you're ready,
so are we.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.781
Okay?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.916
I got to go.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.118
I'll talk to you later.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.986
Everything okay, mcgee?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.088
Delilah wants to stop by.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.190
That's awesome.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.958
I think so, too.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.993
Ever since the parsa takedown,
she's wanted to come by

07:41.995 --> 07:43.195
And thank everyone personally.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.530
Well, so what's the problem?

07:45.532 --> 07:46.865
The wheelchair.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.767
She's uncomfortable
being seen in it.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.836
I think she's still
getting used to the fact

07:50.838 --> 07:52.604
That it's permanent.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.873
I'm not sure what else
to do to help.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.608
Just don't not avoid
not making her

07:56.610 --> 07:57.843
Feel self-conscious about it.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.545
Dinozzo's right.
Yeah.

08:00.547 --> 08:01.847
Missing driver,
let's go.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.181
We've been processing

08:03.183 --> 08:04.850
The backpack found at the scene.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.618
We're thinking the owner saw

08:06.620 --> 08:07.953
Our driver from on high.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.921
Prints?
A bust.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.089
But we did learn
that in addition

08:11.091 --> 08:12.757
To dirt and tight spaces,

08:12.759 --> 08:15.560
Bishop is also good
with heights.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.598
That is all more hazing,
I take it?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.199
No, it's all part
of the job.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.101
(sighs)
anything else?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.870
Uh, found this
in the bottom of the backpack.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.271
Book notes from mrs. Bodey's

08:26.273 --> 08:27.639
12th grade english class.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.940
There's no name.

08:28.942 --> 08:29.975
Clearly male handwriting.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.209
And based on the sloppy prose,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.944
Our guy was skating

08:32.946 --> 08:34.045
Through senior year.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.547
Sickening.
Sickening.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.650
We found a mrs. Bodey at
columbia north high school.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.784
She id'd the handwriting.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.119
And therefore, our slacker.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.687
Pick him up.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.756
Sickening.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.627
Word around school

08:48.629 --> 08:50.629
Is chris valley
and chris hoffman

08:50.631 --> 08:52.163
Are attached at the hip.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.132
You guys go everywhere together.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.200
Do everything together.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.002
Chris squared.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.804
Look, it was
my backpack and paper.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.540
This is my fault.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.874
I should be
the one getting arrested.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.876
No way, dude.
You don't get to go alone.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.046
You want to go to jail?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.681
Just for
a couple nights, maybe.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.551
Anything to make you stand out
helps with scholarships, okay?

09:12.553 --> 09:15.320
Do you know the money that's
out there for reformed convicts?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.022
And talk about
a great application essay.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.190
I could re-apply to northern.
They'd eat that up.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.325
We'll-we'll
tell you everything

09:20.327 --> 09:22.327
As long as you arrest us.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.828
(laughs):
Okay.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.164
Did you drop the bag on purpose?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.165
No.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.700
I mean, I mean, yeah.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.336
Yeah, yeah, we deliberately
caused that wreck.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.038
Huh. Really?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.573
Why?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.241
Because it...

09:36.243 --> 09:38.076
Well, it fel...
It felt, it felt good.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.611
We're out-of-control teens, sir.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.346
We need the state to intervene.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.748
Nobody's going to jail!

09:43.750 --> 09:45.250
Aw, come on!

09:45.252 --> 09:46.351
Your backpack hit a truck

09:46.353 --> 09:47.719
Carrying illegal goods.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.654
And we need to
id the driver.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.690
So we're, like, heroes?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.692
This doesn't help us though.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.760
Okay.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.097
You help me id the driver,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.599
I think I could

10:00.601 --> 10:02.033
Maybe arrange a couple hours

10:02.035 --> 10:04.336
In a holding cell.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.871
Okay.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.973
We can work with that.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.642
So what happened?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.277
Uh, after the crash,
we climbed down to help.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.613
But when the driver got out,
he just took off.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.114
He seemed fine,
so we did the same.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.316
Right, I need
a description.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.819
Uh, he was a big guy.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.954
Overweight, wearing a shirt
that was too small.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.789
Uh, it had a logo on it.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.391
A gun logo.
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.293
For the gun show that they have
every year at the fairgrounds.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.794
It's going on
this week, right?

10:29.796 --> 10:30.929
Yeah, yeah.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.731
So, are you gonna
book us now?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.766
I doubt it.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.967
What if we punched you?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.837
Excuse me?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.939
Excuse me?!

10:40.941 --> 10:45.944
Bishop:
Assaulting a federal officer
carries a six-month minimum.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.146
They'd miss
fall enrollment.
(tony laughs)

10:48.148 --> 10:49.681
So, why are we just
walking around?

10:49.683 --> 10:52.283
Shouldn't we be
asking questions?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.952
The badges say plenty
around here.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.221
I want to see who finds us.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.355
Oh.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.090
Lot of firepower.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.725
Think it's all legal?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.694
I doubt it.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.230
That's why we have
ol' sig watching our back.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.731
Tell me about it.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.335
Ol' sig's there
all the time now.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.203
It's part of the job.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.272
Yep. That becomes
apparent

11:14.274 --> 11:15.907
When they send you down
the training alley,

11:15.909 --> 11:17.242
The one with the
cardboard people that,

11:17.244 --> 11:19.711
Like, pop out,
and you're alone.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.414
No team, no time
to analyze.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.417
It's just...
You and the gun.
(chuckles weakly)

11:25.419 --> 11:26.818
You shot the picture

11:26.820 --> 11:28.119
Of the mother holding the baby,
didn't you?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.455
I thought it was a gun wrapped
in a towel.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.690
Like <i>godfather part ii.</i>

11:31.692 --> 11:33.058
Oh, nice.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.326
You won't tell gibbs
or mcgee, right?
Well...

11:35.328 --> 11:37.328
Can I help you two?

11:37.330 --> 11:40.031
I'm not looking for trouble
at my show.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.434
Ncis special agent
dinozzo and bishop.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.135
Oh, agent, huh?

11:45.738 --> 11:47.138
Fay gussman.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.442
So, you kind of run
this place, <i>ms.</i> Gussman?

11:50.444 --> 11:53.211
This isn't some yokel operation

11:53.213 --> 11:55.714
Selling guns
to crooks or kids.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.215
I got permits
for all my operations

11:57.217 --> 11:59.484
Out in the office trailer.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.019
Ah. Well, we're not here
about permits.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.454
Have you seen this truck?

12:02.456 --> 12:05.323
Sure. Pillsbury doughboy.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.791
Excuse me?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.359
Belongs to a pudgy fella.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.862
Tries to sell at my show
every year without a permit.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.865
Was he trying to sell
marine body armor?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.467
Not here, for damn sure.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.402
I get rid of trouble
when I see it.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.239
Sure I got a name and address
written down somewhere.

12:22.842 --> 12:23.942
Be back in a minute.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.881
Let the badge
work for you.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.382
Mm.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.418
Is that more
body armor?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.253
Looks like it.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.858
For every one of our prepacked
care packages that you send

12:39.860 --> 12:42.026
To your son or daughter,
we'll donate five more.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.862
You can even choose to add
custom items:

12:43.864 --> 12:46.865
A favorite shampoo, sunglasses,
even body armor.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.199
It's against regulations

12:48.201 --> 12:51.002
To wear nonmilitary-
issue body armor.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.772
Well, it's better than wearing
a damaged vest.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.774
Or nothing at all.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.842
And thanks to congressional
budget cuts, that could happen.

12:57.844 --> 12:58.877
Is that one of ours?

12:58.879 --> 13:01.846
No. Different manufacturer.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.783
They're military-grade,
but sold on the civilian market.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.785
If you're looking
for something in particular,

13:06.787 --> 13:08.520
We can order
just about anything.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.955
You ever seen this truck before?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.357
We believe the driver

13:12.359 --> 13:14.125
Was selling
fraudulent military gear.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.295
No. Like I said, we only buy
and send the best.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.797
Troops deserve it.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.931
Amen.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.534
Wish I had more
vendors like karen.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.302
Got that name and address
for you.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.305
Doughboy's name is corey ruxin.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.841
Address is
in falls church.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.376
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.546
Federal agents!

13:34.548 --> 13:36.381
Mcgee:
Ncis!

13:42.822 --> 13:44.956
Gibbs:
Clear.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.558
Clear!

13:46.560 --> 13:48.860
This place is just
as filthy as his truck.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.396
And just as many guns.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.298
But minus the buckets.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.567
(groans)

13:55.569 --> 13:58.303
He could have used one earlier.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.138
Check this out.

14:20.059 --> 14:23.862
Ducky:
Three small-caliber gunshots
to the chest.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.498
However, there are only powder
burns on these two.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.001
First shot was at a distance,
duck?
Possible.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.571
Leaving the shooter free
to get close enough

14:33.573 --> 14:35.206
To administer these two.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.507
That's insurance.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.376
If our victim was selling
the faulty vests,

14:38.378 --> 14:41.446
Someone else made sure
to get to him before we did.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.883
They were tying up loose ends.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.251
Got papers and a cell phone

14:46.253 --> 14:47.952
Recently burned
in the fireplace.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.922
That ash is still warm.
It's gonna be a pain to process.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.957
Oh, I'll do it for you, tony.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.425
I'll bag it and tag it.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.394
Uh, arson cans are in
the mcrt truck, right?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.062
I got it.
Mm-hmm.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.130
Tony:
Thanks.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.965
That was weird.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.300
What, does she owe
you money?

15:02.302 --> 15:06.004
No, she's paying me
to keep a secret.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.139
Really? Is it a good one?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.274
Mm.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.976
Jimmy palmer, where you been?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.012
Been here the whole time, tony.
It's my job.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.281
And I usually notice
you doing it

15:16.283 --> 15:18.349
Because you have more to say,
much more.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.518
At least a "hello."

15:20.520 --> 15:22.287
Hello.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.488
(sighs)

15:23.490 --> 15:25.323
Why is everyone acting
so weird today?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.624
You can tell them,
mr. Palmer.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.692
We're all family here.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.361
I don't want to jinx it now,
doctor.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.997
Saying things aloud
doesn't change

15:32.999 --> 15:37.001
The probabilities
any more than rapping on hard,

15:37.003 --> 15:39.070
Organic tissue
will reverse them.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.339
He means knocking on wood.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.509
Uh, our birth mother
officially signed

15:44.511 --> 15:46.144
The adoption papers today.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.113
So, all she has to do now
is have the kid...

15:49.115 --> 15:50.248
And not change her mind.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.250
Oh, for heaven sake.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.952
I just jinxed it, didn't I?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.119
(phone ringing)
ya think?

15:55.121 --> 15:57.188
Yeah, abbs?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.123
I always do this.
I always say too much.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.733
Is there someplace
else I could wait?

16:08.735 --> 16:13.271
Do you mean is there
someplace else you could hide?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.573
No. You're gonna sit right
there and you're gonna think

16:15.575 --> 16:17.742
About what you
and your company have done.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.712
The faulty vests were the result
of a manufacturing defect, yes.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.047
But we knew about it,

16:23.049 --> 16:25.283
And we marked the entire batch
for destruction.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.018
None of these made it
to the market

16:27.020 --> 16:28.186
Or the military,
miss sciuto.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.022
I-I've been very
forthcoming with you.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.058
So, you think
I'm just being rude?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.127
A little childish maybe?

16:36.129 --> 16:37.295
Hmm.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.064
I believe in magic, prayer,

16:40.066 --> 16:42.667
And logic equally.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.103
Is that childish?

16:45.105 --> 16:47.138
No, it's impossible.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.373
So is what you're saying.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.409
If all defective body armor
was destroyed,

16:51.411 --> 16:54.078
Then why did we find
three crates of it

16:54.080 --> 16:55.413
(elevator bell dings)
in a derelict bakery truck?

16:55.415 --> 16:57.181
There must be some explanation.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.318
To hear about it.
Special agent gibbs,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.186
Benson honeycutt,

17:02.188 --> 17:04.355
Quality control manager
for dearborn dynamics systems.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.091
Still waiting on an explanation.

17:07.093 --> 17:10.728
Sure. So, recall protocol
is incredibly thorough.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.197
Not to mention
the legal hurdles
we have to jump.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.701
Even without nsns, each and
every product id number

17:16.703 --> 17:18.603
Is recorded and
accounted for.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.171
Paperwork would make
your head spin.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.173
Try us.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.075
Of course. Always happy

17:24.077 --> 17:25.543
To cooperate
with any investigation.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.046
Which means this isn't
your first one.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.751
Oh, look. My search shows

17:33.753 --> 17:36.054
That there was a combat zone
mishap report

17:36.056 --> 17:39.257
Involving your body armor.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.225
Yeah, that-that happened
two years ago.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.261
And marine sergeant freddie linn

17:43.263 --> 17:45.396
Is now paralyzed
from the waist down.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.632
And our vest was never proven
to be at fault.

17:47.634 --> 17:52.136
Which I understand sounds cold,
but it's-it's business...

17:52.138 --> 17:53.204
And the truth.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.206
Send linn's info to mcgee.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.275
We're gonna follow up
on this anyway.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.509
Good.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.246
Sit!

18:10.355 --> 18:12.223
Uh, gps error, mcgee?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.357
When I spoke
to sergeant linn,

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
This is where he said to meet.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.595
Didn't know
it was an empty field.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.669
Well, he said he'd be here
by 3:00.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.637
I'll give him another call.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.406
Man:
Heads up!

18:34.646 --> 18:36.581
Mcgee:
Freddie linn?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.850
Hey. You guys must be ncis.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.352
You mind grabbing me
my other half?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.754
Thank you.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.790
Man 2:
You good?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.158
Thanks.
All right.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.294
(grunting):
Sorry I'm late. Headwinds.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.662
That would explain

18:51.664 --> 18:53.231
The noise when I called.

18:53.233 --> 18:57.268
Yeah, well, I got tired
of hearing what I couldn't do

18:57.270 --> 18:59.237
And figured I'd give
people some other reason

18:59.239 --> 19:01.772
To stare, so I started
a skydiving company.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.307
So you were
a former paratrooper?

19:03.309 --> 19:04.342
No, no, no,

19:04.344 --> 19:06.144
But, uh, jumping sounded fun,

19:06.146 --> 19:08.279
And turns out,
you don't need legs to fall

19:08.281 --> 19:09.814
Or to turn a nice profit.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.316
Appreciate you taking the time.
Yeah, well,

19:12.318 --> 19:15.419
I wasn't thrilled
about digging this
up again,

19:15.421 --> 19:18.289
But, uh, when you said it had
something to do with bad gear,

19:18.291 --> 19:20.424
I was-I was curious.
What's this got to do with me?

19:20.426 --> 19:23.628
You don't believe your body
armor was faulty?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.831
I took four hits to the back
in a firefight outside of kabul

19:26.833 --> 19:29.300
And yeah, my armor shattered,

19:29.302 --> 19:31.602
But nothing's guaranteed
to hold up against that,
and any one

19:31.604 --> 19:34.305
Of those bullets could have been
the thing that clipped my spine.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.607
You seem pretty calm
about it all.

19:36.609 --> 19:40.344
Eh, letting go of blame-- it's
the first thing you gotta do.

19:40.346 --> 19:44.182
So please don't tell me
there's new blame to be had.

19:44.184 --> 19:48.519
Well, we're investigating
a batch of defective armor

19:48.521 --> 19:50.955
That may have been
sold illegally.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.657
Where'd your vest come from?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.359
(sighs):
Well, it's been two years.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.662
Do we... Do we have
to go down that road, sir?

19:57.664 --> 20:00.298
For the sake of the others,
let's be sure, huh?

20:02.501 --> 20:04.869
It was a gift from my mother.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.672
I don't have any
reason to ask her

20:07.674 --> 20:09.640
Where it came from,
and I'm not about to now.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.443
The guilt's gonna kill her.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.345
Gibbs:
Not her fault.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.480
Sorry.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.249
Oh, no, don't be.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.418
It's not as good as what I had
before all this,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.386
But, uh, it works.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.355
Do you mind if I ask you,

20:24.357 --> 20:27.525
How long did it take you
to get used to it?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.393
You don't.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.296
You just, uh, choose to move on.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.533
Which will be a lot easier
when you tell me

20:35.535 --> 20:38.269
This is all put to rest.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.871
Ducky:
Severe serrating
on the subdermis,

20:40.873 --> 20:46.010
The lacerations being
approximately three inches.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.979
Jimmy:
Severe serrating confirmed.

20:47.981 --> 20:50.615
Lacerations approximately
three inches.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.983
And again, no damage here.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.851
I mean, it's amazing

20:53.853 --> 20:56.420
What an actual working vest
can do.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.855
(growls)

20:57.857 --> 20:59.257
Honeycutt.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.524
While there's no way to prove

21:00.526 --> 21:01.726
What ultimately caused

21:01.728 --> 21:03.828
His paralysis,
sergeant linn's wounds

21:03.830 --> 21:07.265
Match those on the
ballistic dummy.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.733
These vests came

21:08.735 --> 21:10.268
From the same bad batch.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.869
Honeycutt.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.871
It's amazing how much damage
a bullet can do.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.840
Yes, and these
were low-velocity,

21:15.842 --> 21:17.775
Solid-point rounds.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.478
Do we really need to make
anything more powerful, doctor?

21:20.480 --> 21:24.749
There will always be a desire
for more power, dear boy.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.651
(pops)
oh!

21:26.653 --> 21:28.319
Ah. (chuckles)

21:28.321 --> 21:30.888
I'm so glad you gave up
all those silly superstitions

21:30.890 --> 21:33.391
About celebrating happy news.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.393
Jimmy:
Oh, yeah.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.827
Breena bought those
bubble gum cigars

21:36.829 --> 21:38.396
When we decided to adopt.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.431
What?!

21:40.433 --> 21:41.899
That's what these are?

21:41.901 --> 21:44.302
Yeah,
they were about to go bad.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.936
I mean, that's not gonna
jinx it, is it?

21:45.938 --> 21:46.937
Jimmy!

21:46.939 --> 21:48.039
That's not how

21:48.041 --> 21:49.040
These things work.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.841
It's not?
No!

21:50.843 --> 21:52.410
You need to touch
something wood.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.577
Like, right now.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.446
Let me get...
Uh, I...

21:56.548 --> 21:58.649
Everything in here is metal!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.384
I... (clears throat)

22:01.486 --> 22:03.721
Keep it.

22:10.762 --> 22:11.896
You finding
anything useful?

22:11.898 --> 22:13.664
No. I mean,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.033
About what?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.602
The case.
Oh, right.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.771
Uh, sergeant linn's mother
is here and on her way up.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.873
She say where she got the vest?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.008
Said she doesn't remember
sending it

22:24.010 --> 22:25.343
And insisted on coming in.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.677
I get the sense she's harboring

22:26.679 --> 22:29.914
More residual anger
than her son.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.783
Can I ask you a question?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.852
Mm-hmm. Just did.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.555
You were a sniper.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.490
How did you do it?

22:41.460 --> 22:42.927
Pulled the trigger.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.829
Right.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.964
But what did you...
What did you think about

22:46.966 --> 22:48.632
When you were taking aim?

22:48.634 --> 22:52.002
Smoke-checking
the target, bishop.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.104
Right.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.772
Of course.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.878
I'm malory linn,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.079
Freddie linn's mother.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.714
You the agent in charge?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.616
Yes, ma'am.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.851
Then I've got two questions.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.986
Why the hell is this
just coming out now?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.489
And who the hell is responsible?

23:11.491 --> 23:12.690
We understand your concern,
but...

23:12.692 --> 23:14.392
Save it!
You told me

23:14.394 --> 23:15.960
I sent my son body armor

23:15.962 --> 23:16.994
That got him paralyzed?

23:16.996 --> 23:19.029
Uh, yes, ma'am.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.631
Well, if that's true,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.400
We got more problems.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.667
Who is "we"?

23:23.669 --> 23:24.902
These are mothers

23:24.904 --> 23:26.470
Who have also sent their sons

23:26.472 --> 23:29.140
And daughters extra body armor.

23:29.142 --> 23:31.175
So either somebody starts
answering our questions

23:31.177 --> 23:34.044
Or we start asking them
in front of tv cameras.

23:48.794 --> 23:51.695
Well, they agreed to hold off
on contacting any news outlets.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.098
We just need a chance
to do our job, tim.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.867
After mrs. Linn found out
about the vests,

23:56.869 --> 23:59.570
She contacted every
military family she knew,

23:59.572 --> 24:01.605
Hence the mom militia.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.774
They all sent body armor?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.810
Well, that's what we're trying
to find out right now,

24:05.812 --> 24:08.446
But I think some are just
concerned moms and citizens.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.582
As they should be until we find
out the source of these vests.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.785
Manufacturer sent over
all the recall records.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.554
It's a lot of paperwork.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.888
Something could easily fall
through the cracks.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.223
Yeah, go, find out.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.492
(phone ringing)

24:22.761 --> 24:25.796
Delilah, hey.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.064
You're where?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.866
Professor x.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.868
Lieutenant dan!

24:30.870 --> 24:32.736
Dr. Strangelove.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.872
Ah, how about logan cale?

24:34.874 --> 24:36.807
Jake sully?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.108
The old lady from <i>titanic?</i>

24:38.110 --> 24:39.944
Tony!

24:39.946 --> 24:41.712
I thought we talked specifically

24:41.714 --> 24:43.547
About not listing
disabled movie characters.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.648
Delilah,

24:44.650 --> 24:45.883
I'm so sorry. I wish I knew

24:45.885 --> 24:47.017
That you were coming today.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.686
Relax, tim.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.554
I could've saved us
all the embarrassment.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.557
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who's embarrassed.

24:53.559 --> 24:54.992
What?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.861
I started it as a contest,

24:56.863 --> 24:58.796
And I still think I can name
more than tony.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.164
(laughs)

25:00.166 --> 25:01.966
Okay, fine, you
were right, tim.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.667
It feels really good to get out.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.135
Oh.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.004
Oh, okay then.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.039
Dod delilah, good to see you.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.808
Yeah, you, too.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.210
Hey, since you're all here,

25:13.212 --> 25:14.845
I would like to thank you
for taking out

25:14.847 --> 25:17.548
That evil, coward bastard,
benham parsa.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.849
Tony:
You know, that was actually

25:18.851 --> 25:19.984
The name
on the death certificate.

25:19.986 --> 25:20.985
(laughs)

25:20.987 --> 25:22.753
Delilah!

25:22.755 --> 25:24.054
Uh, incredible to see
you're doing so well,

25:24.056 --> 25:25.689
And I can't wait to catch up,

25:25.691 --> 25:27.625
But I have a break in the case.
You understand.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.860
Oh, go, babe.
Okay, two things.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.195
One, remember

25:31.197 --> 25:33.163
The charity woman we met
at the gun show?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.232
No. Yes, karen.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.001
According to malory linn's
bank statements,

25:37.003 --> 25:38.736
She wrote, uh, a check

25:38.738 --> 25:40.771
To home in your hands
foundation.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.940
Vest was part
of a care package.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.675
Which is why mrs. Linn
doesn't remember sending it.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.111
Charity must have shipped
other vests.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.013
Okay, that's the thing, too.
I have three other mothers

25:49.015 --> 25:51.815
Upstairs who sent care packages
via the same organization.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.551
Dates?
As recent

25:53.553 --> 25:54.919
As last month,
and they were sent to troops

25:54.921 --> 25:56.186
In multiple branches
of the military.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.289
The marine corps
has been on alert

25:58.291 --> 26:00.024
Since we found
the bakery truck.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.792
So we're gonna need to
coordinate with everyone now.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.193
Get dod

26:03.195 --> 26:04.929
Online in mtac.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.931
A friendly face
might speed things up.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.700
Oh, come on, you're just trying
to make me feel better.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.302
Well, it depends.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.270
How am I doing? It working?

26:14.205 --> 26:15.906
Kind of.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.211
Find the charity woman. On it.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.582
(elevator bell dings)

26:26.117 --> 26:28.819
Oh, do you want me
to roll you in?

26:28.821 --> 26:30.321
No, I was letting
you go first.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.090
Oh. Okay.

26:37.228 --> 26:38.929
Uh...
Ooh.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.364
I'm sorry,
I just need to turn around.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.800
Sorry. Um...
Oh.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.802
You know what, let me twist
you. I can help if I...

26:44.804 --> 26:45.936
If I twist you.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.805
Uh, you know what,
I'm just gonna back out.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.239
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.008
It's fine.
I'm sorry.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.110
Okay, okay.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.151
You know, there's tom cruise
in <i>born on the fourth of July.</i>

27:01.153 --> 27:03.220
Guy from <i>coming home.</i>

27:04.389 --> 27:07.057
That kind of only works
with tony.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.003
Bishop:
What's she waiting for?

27:19.005 --> 27:20.771
Tony:
Give it time.

27:20.773 --> 27:21.939
It's already been 35 minutes

27:21.941 --> 27:23.173
Since we traced her cell phone.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.275
I mean, she hasn't moved.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.011
She know we're watching?

27:27.013 --> 27:29.313
Are we being set up?
Should I call in backup?

27:29.315 --> 27:30.948
These have splinters.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.250
Give me a, uh, another
set of chopsticks.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.952
I'm overanalyzing again, huh?

27:34.954 --> 27:37.087
Soy sauce, please.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.724
Are you ignoring me
and eating?

27:40.726 --> 27:43.994
Work smarter,
not harder, bishop.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.096
Universe rolls on its own.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.765
Why get out and push?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.900
How does that apply
to carrying a gun?

27:49.902 --> 27:51.435
Like, say in the alley training,

27:51.437 --> 27:53.003
How do I know when I'm pushing?

27:53.005 --> 27:55.739
I'd love more advice.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.174
Advice, huh?
Mm-hmm.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.711
See what that says.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.882
(chuckles)
(sighs)

28:05.984 --> 28:07.751
Anything yet?

28:07.753 --> 28:09.887
(groans)
if she's in the middle

28:09.889 --> 28:11.221
Of nefarious charity dealings,

28:11.223 --> 28:13.957
I don't see... Oh, wait.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.125
I see something.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.428
Yep, yep.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.998
I see it.
Yeah.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.171
(tires squealing)

28:27.173 --> 28:29.373
(horn blaring)

28:29.375 --> 28:30.974
Federal agents!

28:30.976 --> 28:32.776
Turn off the vehicles.

28:32.778 --> 28:33.977
Put your hands on
the steering wheel.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.079
Please.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.413
Why don't you check

28:36.415 --> 28:38.048
The paper bag, emily post.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.022
Anything good?

28:45.024 --> 28:47.091
This is gonna
sound weird, but...

28:51.196 --> 28:54.198
They're extra-absorbent tampons.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.934
Hardly worth arresting me for.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.336
It's funny. I usually get
mine at the grocery store.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.771
Mm.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.073
And do you have
a favorite brand?

29:03.075 --> 29:05.175
Maybe.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.244
Well, that guy that you
freaked out in the pickup truck

29:07.246 --> 29:09.313
Is the father of a marine,

29:09.315 --> 29:11.315
And she has
a favorite brand, too.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.383
I was on my way to
the post office when he called,

29:13.385 --> 29:15.519
Wanting to add these
to her care package.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.354
So you stopped
just for that?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.189
I do whatever it takes.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.758
The least we can do
for our troops

29:20.760 --> 29:22.226
Is give them what they want.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.862
Hmm. Last time I heard,

29:24.864 --> 29:26.930
Our troops just want
gear that works.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.367
What is this?

29:30.369 --> 29:32.169
The vests you've been sending.

29:33.338 --> 29:34.805
Courtesy of this guy.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.142
We have proof
faulty vests

29:38.144 --> 29:40.177
Have come from
your organization.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.516
You've been buying
shoddy armor...
No.

29:45.518 --> 29:47.117
And pocketing the profit.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.218
No!

29:48.220 --> 29:49.887
I started my organization

29:49.889 --> 29:51.421
Because me father, his father

29:51.423 --> 29:54.124
And my great-grandfather
before him all served.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.293
I do it in their honor.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.228
For their sacrifice.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.198
What about
sergeant linn's sacrifice?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.071
Upon bullet impact,
the ceramic plates

30:08.073 --> 30:10.274
Shattered
and entered his lower back.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.444
I think I'm gonna be sick.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.085
Good.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.924
I had no idea they were faulty.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.325
He told me
they were authentic.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.260
Corey ruxin?

30:32.564 --> 30:35.098
Lives are at risk.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.202
But you can still help us
before more damage is done.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.539
I never asked ruxin questions

30:42.541 --> 30:46.176
Because it saved money.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.178
So I could send more.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.380
Where were you this morning?

30:50.382 --> 30:53.016
I was at the expo all day,

30:53.018 --> 30:55.052
Taking donations
and orders.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.353
You can check
credit card transactions.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.156
I'm the only employee we have.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.859
We're gonna need all
your shipping records,

31:01.861 --> 31:04.127
Names, unit numbers, everything.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.396
The faulty gear
is still out there.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.199
(phone rings)

31:09.201 --> 31:11.235
Yeah, mcgee?

31:11.237 --> 31:14.371
Dod's put out
a system-wide advisory

31:14.373 --> 31:16.406
On the faulty vests.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.041
It urges troops to use

31:18.043 --> 31:19.409
Only their
military-issued body armor.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.279
Sounds like there's
a "but" coming.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.915
According to my bosses
and marine forces

31:24.917 --> 31:26.250
Central command,
there's a team

31:26.252 --> 31:28.285
On an active recon mission
in helmand province.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.087
Afghanistan.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.356
It's a hot spot for
insurgent activity.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.261
And that's just
in the last month.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.129
The team's out
of radio contact.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.631
And not only will
the bulletin not
reach them...

31:40.633 --> 31:42.332
Mcgee:
We have confirmation

31:42.334 --> 31:44.368
That two squad members
received care packages

31:44.370 --> 31:45.669
From upline's charity.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.337
There are marines

31:47.339 --> 31:49.273
Wearing faulty gear into battle.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.519
They said they'd be right back.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.055
I-is the feed still live?
'cause it looks like they cut.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.391
Boys sent you up
to wait for word, huh?

32:07.393 --> 32:09.259
Rookie hazing?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.295
Uh...

32:11.297 --> 32:13.330
Two hot chicks...

32:13.332 --> 32:15.299
They probably figured
we'd get faster results.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.566
And I'm in a wheelchair.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.001
Double points.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.403
(laughs)
aw...

32:19.405 --> 32:20.570
Oh, no, you'd be surprised.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.272
People go out of their way
to help me now.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.441
Total strangers, boyfriends.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.475
I don't always need it.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.577
Well...

32:27.579 --> 32:30.047
People are generally good.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.617
Someone was selling
defective body armor,

32:33.619 --> 32:35.319
And then someone
killed that someone.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.987
And now we are
trying to get

32:36.989 --> 32:39.056
Some of those vests back
from a u.S. Marine

32:39.058 --> 32:42.159
Recon unit in afghanistan.

32:42.161 --> 32:46.430
Well, I guess we all
need help sometimes.

32:46.432 --> 32:49.199
Maybe.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.435
You read that
in a fortune cookie?

32:52.503 --> 32:54.538
Yeah.
(laughs)

33:01.279 --> 33:03.213
This recall paperwork
is mind-numbing.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.116
Well, legal statutes,
mandatory procedures,

33:06.118 --> 33:08.352
And corporate oversights
are meant to protect us.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.120
Whatever happened to darwinism?

33:10.122 --> 33:11.488
You have to sign
a release for that.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.357
Well, everything
here looks good.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.192
It appears the manufacturer
followed protocol

33:15.194 --> 33:16.426
And properly disposed

33:16.428 --> 33:18.061
Of the defective vests.

33:18.063 --> 33:19.463
Ha-ha!

33:19.465 --> 33:21.131
So it wasn't the
contractor in the lab

33:21.133 --> 33:22.432
With the faulty
body armor?

33:22.434 --> 33:23.667
First time for everything.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.102
Give me an update.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.370
Well, the charity woman's alibi

33:26.372 --> 33:28.205
Checks out for
the time of the murder.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.073
Marine unit in afghanistan.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.708
Uh... Bishop and delilah

33:31.710 --> 33:33.310
Are trying to get
a message to them.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.444
So far, no luck.

33:34.446 --> 33:37.180
Is there any good news?

33:37.182 --> 33:38.682
Tony:
Delilah seems to be
liking the distraction.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.350
Otherwise... Nothing good.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.385
Huh.

33:41.387 --> 33:42.386
Adjust your ascot

33:42.388 --> 33:43.487
And back up the
mystery machine.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.389
It sounds like
mcscooby's got a clue.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.356
Maybe...

33:46.358 --> 33:48.492
Boss, legally,

33:48.494 --> 33:50.127
The manufacturer has to hire
a recycling company

33:50.129 --> 33:51.528
To destroy the vests.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.596
I mean, that sounds
like something

33:52.598 --> 33:54.031
That should cost
a pretty penny.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.366
So the company took a hit?
No.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.235
According to last quarter's
earning statement,

33:58.237 --> 34:00.637
The body armor
division made money.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.806
Forms signed by
benson honeycutt.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.474
Makes no sense.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.143
How do you make money
off defective items?

34:06.145 --> 34:07.677
I knew the corporate stooge
had to be involved.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.746
Let's go.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.688
You better explain
all this to me

34:18.690 --> 34:20.490
Before my boss
comes in here.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.225
'cause he's not much
for legal forms.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.393
My company
followed

34:23.395 --> 34:25.095
The letter of
the law to a t.

34:25.097 --> 34:28.532
You've been making money
off your mistakes.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.468
There's nothing wrong
with good business.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.703
And scare tactics
don't work on me.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.073
I've stared into the
eyes of the irs before

34:36.075 --> 34:38.809
And I'm still
standing.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.710
Military lives
aren't write-offs.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.412
These
vests are.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.347
And we properly and
legally disposed of them.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.617
You have three seconds.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.320
Any manager worth
his salt will make

34:50.322 --> 34:51.555
Lemonade
from lemons.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.364
These lemons get
people killed.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.602
Your mound of paperwork
can't hide kickbacks.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.505
The recycling company was
paying you for the contract.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.273
My department, yes.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.809
The sale of valuable
goods is legal.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.778
So you knew they were
gonna sell the body armor.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.547
No, they were gonna sell
raw silicon carbide.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.615
It's used
in making

35:18.617 --> 35:20.450
Ceramic plates
in the armor.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.585
It's also used for
making everything

35:21.587 --> 35:23.487
From car brakes
to l.E.D. Lights.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.754
That's why they pay us.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.390
Look, if the
recycling company

35:27.392 --> 35:29.192
Is not destroying the vests
for the raw material,

35:29.194 --> 35:30.760
It's-it's not my problem.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.529
Legally, we are
in the clear.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.630
Mcgee:
Boss...

35:33.632 --> 35:35.365
You turning your back

35:35.367 --> 35:36.566
Makes you just as guilty.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.868
Mcgee:
Check this out.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.436
Personally,
I feel bad.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.704
But my job is
to audit the company.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.139
Nothing more.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.473
Yeah, well,
we got plenty more.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.675
Phone records.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.310
Mcgee:
You received six calls

35:47.312 --> 35:50.413
From fay gussman in
the last 24 hours.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.215
She runs more than
just the gun expo.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.618
She owns the recycling company.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.219
Tony:
Well, look at that.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.488
You and good ol'
guss are bffs.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.625
Let's ask her.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.326
Go on.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.696
You think she'll talk?

36:07.765 --> 36:09.733
Wait.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.905
She called me
when the vests

36:14.907 --> 36:16.306
Were found in the crash.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.175
She said she wanted
to tie up loose ends

36:18.177 --> 36:19.442
So it didn't get back to her.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.211
I didn't know that
that meant murder.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.582
You knew the vests were
never gonna be recycled.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.317
No.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.352
But I want to call a lawyer.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.225
You call gussman first.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.693
What? What for?

36:36.695 --> 36:39.896
You two are gonna
have a meeting.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.916
(dog barking in distance)

36:59.918 --> 37:02.252
(vehicles approaching)

37:02.254 --> 37:03.887
(tires screeching)

37:11.729 --> 37:12.896
Gibbs:
Ncis!

37:12.898 --> 37:14.331
Come out with your hands up!

37:19.003 --> 37:20.637
Go.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.242
(automatic gunfire)

37:31.482 --> 37:33.283
(bishop grunts)
tony: Bishop!

37:33.285 --> 37:34.684
Now!

37:44.262 --> 37:45.962
(gasps)

37:58.876 --> 38:00.277
(bishop groans)

38:00.279 --> 38:01.845
(dog barking in distance)

38:01.847 --> 38:03.546
(groans)

38:03.548 --> 38:04.981
Bishop.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.816
Bishop.
(groans)

38:06.818 --> 38:07.951
Bishop.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.053
(coughs)

38:10.055 --> 38:13.456
Oh, holy fish sticks,
that hurt.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.325
(distant siren wailing)

38:15.327 --> 38:17.294
Lucky you got the real thing.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.329
Mcgee:
Can't say the same thing
for ms. Gussman.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.399
She tried using one of those
faulty vests as a last resort.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.967
(moans)
is she dead?

38:23.969 --> 38:25.935
It all comes
around, bishop.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.937
(sirens approaching)

38:27.939 --> 38:29.572
(moans)

38:29.574 --> 38:32.042
All right?
Yeah.

38:32.044 --> 38:34.711
Thanks.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.653
Hey.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.355
Hey, back.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.357
Just got word from afghanistan.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.992
Marine unit made
it back safely.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.627
Mcgee:
And since we found the
rest of the faulty vests

38:50.629 --> 38:52.462
In gussman's storage unit,

38:52.464 --> 38:53.930
All body armor is accounted for.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.365
Mm, nice work.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.433
You, too.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.967
Thanks for including me.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.669
It was good.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.871
You ready to be back?
Oh, no.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.506
I think I still have

39:03.508 --> 39:05.642
A few things I need
to figure out.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.344
Plus, I need

39:07.346 --> 39:09.379
(bishop moans)
some more time
with this puppy.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.514
Although I'm
thinking bishop

39:11.516 --> 39:13.383
Might need it more than me.
Hey!

39:13.385 --> 39:15.452
Hi, how you
holding up?

39:15.454 --> 39:16.720
Bruised ribs.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.688
Can't breathe.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.990
Part of the job.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.092
No, it isn't.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.594
But the paperwork is.

39:31.068 --> 39:32.802
Agent gibbs?

39:34.071 --> 39:36.573
Do you mind if tim
gives me a ride home?

39:36.575 --> 39:38.141
Nah.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.843
Make him take you
to breakfast first.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.412
Ooh.
That sounds good.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.848
Actually, boss,
I had another stop in mind.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.416
It might take a little longer.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.985
Take as long as you need, tim.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.587
What are you two talking about?

39:50.589 --> 39:51.855
Should I be worried?

39:51.857 --> 39:53.590
No.

39:53.592 --> 39:54.924
Go.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.459
Go!

40:03.067 --> 40:05.068
(airplane approaching)
(car door closing)

40:05.070 --> 40:06.503
Delilah:
This is weird.

40:06.505 --> 40:07.737
Kind of creepy.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.005
Why is there a wheelchair

40:09.007 --> 40:11.474
In the middle
of that field?

40:24.188 --> 40:26.189
Freddie:
(whoops) bull's-eye!

40:26.191 --> 40:28.191
Seven out of ten!
I'll be right over,

40:28.193 --> 40:29.726
Agent mcgee.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.028
So he's...?

40:32.030 --> 40:33.963
I wanted you to meet him.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.432
He went through
some of

40:35.434 --> 40:37.467
The same things you have, and...

40:37.469 --> 40:40.870
Well, I thought
a talk would be nice.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.041
(exhales)
thank you.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.946
Come here.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.751
(sniffles)

40:55.719 --> 40:57.020
But if we're already here,

40:57.022 --> 40:58.655
We should do more
than just talk.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.056
What do you mean?

41:00.058 --> 41:02.492
I've always wanted
to go skydiving.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.993
Skydiving?

41:03.995 --> 41:05.895
Mm.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.964
I'll jump if you do.

41:12.169 --> 41:14.237
Um...

41:17.675 --> 41:21.678
