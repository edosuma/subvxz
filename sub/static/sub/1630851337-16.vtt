BLAKE, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SAY TO PEEDY RIGHT NOW

39:25.098 --> 39:30.103

YOU'RE A LIAR.

39:35.508 --> 39:36.710

40:13.980 --> 40:16.249
TEACH.
LABELS CAN'T DEVELOP THAT.

40:16.249 --> 40:20.854
THAT HAS TO COME FROM THE PERSON
AND THE ARTIST

40:20.854 --> 40:23.156
THAT IS JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE
OTHER THAN HAVING A PHENOMENAL

40:23.156 --> 40:25.425
