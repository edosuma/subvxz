[Pete] Down, boy!

11:20.430 --> 11:22.766
Keep shooting! Keep shooting!

11:22.849 --> 11:24.768
I want this for my private collection.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.188
Pistol!

11:28.271 --> 11:29.272
Pistol!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.149
Have you seen her, Maxie?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.026
Not a pigtail.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.152
And I've looked just about everywhere

11:34.235 --> 11:36.696
you'd expect to find
the world's smallest pilot.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.282
You pint-sized pilots
don't want to miss this.

11:39.366 --> 11:43.244
The Maple Mallard,
the world's largest jet,

11:43.328 --> 11:46.790
is warming up right now on runway 1.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.166
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.752
[Pete]
Folks, is my competition

11:50.835 --> 11:53.380
puttin' the squeeze on you

11:53.463 --> 11:55.006
with high prices?

11:55.090 --> 11:58.677
At Pete's RVs, Monty the Python and I

11:58.760 --> 12:01.596
will make sure no snake in the grass

12:01.680 --> 12:04.849
takes advantage of you, right, Monty?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.311
Hey, cut it out! Aak!

12:08.395 --> 12:10.730
Cut it out!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.819
Hey. Pete, why'd you stop?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.904
You were goin' real good.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.702
I don't believe this.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.286
Over a thousand commercials shot,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.664
and the spud picks now
to get stage fright.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.089
Hey, is he gettin' taller?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.924
Help me!

12:38.008 --> 12:39.884
That reptile really likes old Petey.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.386
Never mind that.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.930
Look at the disgusting colour
he's turning.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.432
[crtoakily] Mama.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.933

12:50.854 --> 12:52.230

12:52.689 --> 12:54.649
[jet engine starts]

12:54.733 --> 12:57.027
Pistol, get down from there!

13:00.113 --> 13:03.283
Gawrsh!
That was close.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.341
Aah!

13:31.478 --> 13:33.563
Wow! Neat-o!

13:33.646 --> 13:38.777
But I wanna fly. It's my life, my fate,
my destiny. I just know it is.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.779
I'm sure it is, Pistol.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.907
But you're also only 4 years old.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.367
4 1/2!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.285
She'll never see 5.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.792
You're a very grown-up
little girl, all right.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.294
We promised your daddy to look out for ya.

13:56.378 --> 13:59.714
We'd hate to have somethin' happen to ya.
Wouldn't we, Max?

13:59.798 --> 14:02.217
Oh, yeah. It would be tragic.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.220
I'm sorry, Mr G.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.805
[snorts]

14:06.888 --> 14:08.223
Blow.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.642
[toots]

14:10.767 --> 14:11.810
Don't worry, honey.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.771
Everything's gonna be okey-dokey.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.109
Gawrsh! Hyuk!

14:19.192 --> 14:20.527
Gross!

14:20.610 --> 14:22.445
There ya go, Pistol.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.407
[gasps] Can I have one of those?

14:25.865 --> 14:26.991
[Goofy]
Balloons?

14:27.075 --> 14:31.371
Hm. Well, I can't see that bags of air
are very dangerous.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.206
Uh, help her, Maxie.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.752
Hi, I'm Pistol.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.673
I sell balloons, not bullets.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.425
I want that one.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.177
Here!

14:46.261 --> 14:49.222
Not that. The red one.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.390
This one?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.392
No. No. The other red one.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.894
No, wait, wait, the next one.
No, no, two over from that one.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.646
Just take one.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.442
There you go, little miss rifle.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.110
It's Pistol!

15:02.193 --> 15:04.904
Well, I don't care if it's bazooka.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.240
You got the goods, now, hit the bricks!

15:07.323 --> 15:10.910
You're imposin' on my good nature!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.666
Wow!

15:19.169 --> 15:20.211
[evil chuckle]

15:20.295 --> 15:23.298
-Waah!
-What's the matter now?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.095
OK, OK!
Buy another one. Buy 'em all.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.181
Anything to keep you quiet.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.224
Thank you, Max.
You made me very, very, very,

15:33.308 --> 15:36.144
very, very, very happy. Goodbye!

15:36.227 --> 15:38.021
Everything all right, Max?

15:38.104 --> 15:39.522
Sure, Pop.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.025
Everything's under complete control.

15:46.404 --> 15:50.033
Mr G, Mr G, look at me,
look at me, look at me!

15:50.116 --> 15:52.035
-Aah!
-Aah!

15:52.118 --> 15:54.954
Whee!

15:55.038 --> 15:57.665
Pistol, come back here!

16:00.126 --> 16:03.338
[grunting] Just a little higher.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.050
Max-- Oh! Can you reach her? Ow! Ow!

16:07.133 --> 16:09.594
Gotcha! Aah!

16:10.387 --> 16:11.930
I got her...

16:13.765 --> 16:14.724
It's a start.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.852
Hey, everybody, look at me!
Look, I'm way, way up high!

16:17.936 --> 16:19.562
Looky, look at me.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.148
Come on, Maxie. We can't let her get away.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.278
Well, here goes nothin'.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.866
We now direct your attention
to the southwest field--

16:31.950 --> 16:34.285
where Giblet, the human cannonball clown

16:34.369 --> 16:37.539
will fly like very the wind itself.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.791
Ohh, I wanna try that next.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.168
Oh, you think we could
speed this up a might?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.384
Just stay still for another second.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.596
Sure this is... safe?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.181
Sure, it's safe.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.018
It ain't gonna hurt me a bit.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.936
Aah!

17:00.020 --> 17:02.897
Hey, no fair!
Let go of me!

17:03.023 --> 17:05.525
Hold still. This isn't gonna hurt a--

17:05.608 --> 17:08.862
Aah!

17:12.699 --> 17:15.035

17:18.288 --> 17:19.956

17:20.040 --> 17:22.125
Well, at Pete's RVs,

17:22.208 --> 17:25.754
you'll go ape over our low, low prices,

17:25.837 --> 17:28.923
-right, Coco?
-[bell rings]

17:29.007 --> 17:31.968

the plane stunt.

17:35.513 --> 17:39.392
Uh, say, this isn't dangerous, is it?

17:39.476 --> 17:40.643
You'll be fine.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.354
Coco's a great pilot.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.065
[grunting]

17:46.733 --> 17:50.403

gonna fly the plane?

17:50.487 --> 17:53.823
Don't worry.
He hasn't crashed one in days.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.617
Days?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.660
Take it away, banana-breath!

Never mind that, Pop. What're we gonna do?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.209
I'll ask the pilot.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.880
Uh, pardon me, Harry,

18:50.964 --> 18:54.009
but, uh, this is a life or
dismemberment situation.

both of us to shoot the thing.
