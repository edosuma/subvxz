Hold on 'cause I'm letting go

00:29.780 --> 00:33.160
I'm gonna lasso your heart like a rodeo

00:33.367 --> 00:36.997
I'm gonna give you some
till you want some more

00:37.204 --> 00:40.924
'cause all I see is an open door

00:41.124 --> 00:44.884
and I see where it's leading me
all of this energy

00:45.087 --> 00:48.627
been bottled up way too long
it's powerful, powerful

00:48.841 --> 00:52.391
you see what I'm getting at
I'm ready for all of that

00:52.594 --> 00:56.104
if I'm not a star, you're blind

00:56.306 --> 00:59.596
I've got rings on my fingers
and glitter in my hair

00:59.810 --> 01:03.060
I've got a one-way ticket
and I just got here

01:03.272 --> 01:06.942
I'm gonna run this town

01:07.150 --> 01:11.110
I'm gonna run this town
run this town

01:11.321 --> 01:14.911
I've got high heel stilettos
and I'm kicking in doors

01:15.117 --> 01:18.197
and kissing your ass
ain't what my lipstick's for

01:18.412 --> 01:22.122
I'm gonna run this town
run this town

01:22.332 --> 01:25.292
I'm gonna run this town

01:25.502 --> 01:28.962
where's breakfast?
I want waffles, spaghetti!

01:29.173 --> 01:32.433
Spaghetti waffles! Whoo. Whoo!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.644
Victor. Victor.
Please wait in the house, please.

01:34.845 --> 01:35.895
[Victor groans]

01:36.096 --> 01:38.886
My body is entering hunger shock.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.139
[Thud]

01:40.350 --> 01:43.980
Oh, bad news.
The cat pooped in the den.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.438
Worse news,
i used your blanket to clean it up.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.529
-We don't have a cat.
-No kidding.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.405
[Door slams and Victor laughs]

02:23.227 --> 02:24.477
[Door creaks]

02:24.686 --> 02:28.186
Oh. I-- sorry.
I didn't think you'd be awake.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.518
You have an appointment...

02:29.733 --> 02:32.323
...with guy Morgan,
i didn't think you'd wanna be late.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.408
Oh, look at you thinking. Cute.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.664
But I always have time for my portrait.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.406
Look alive. Paint.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.616
I'm feeling spiritually blocked.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.658
Draw me a sesame seed bath.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.251
Bath. Now.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.964
Now, make momma look more beautiful
and thinner.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.208
[Water running]

02:49.419 --> 02:50.669
And make that water more quiet.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.298
-Bev, you awake?
-Of course I'm awake.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.050
If I waited for you, I'd never be on time.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.723
Lucky you never wait for me, then.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.605
Katie:
Victor, no.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.207
Uh, don't you want a glass?

03:25.414 --> 03:31.424
Hmm. Earthy. A tad fishy.
Lovely gravel finish.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.419
Did you let Victor put worms
in the blender again?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.802
Yes. I mean, no.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.932
I mean, it just happened.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.810
You know nothing can kill me.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.643
Nothing.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.071
Gail: Step on it, Katie.
I cannot be late for this meeting.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.614
Just run them over if you have to.

03:53.817 --> 03:54.857
[Students screaming]

03:55.068 --> 03:56.318
[Cell phone rings
and Gail sighs]

03:56.528 --> 03:59.448
Hello? No, the kids don't need a library.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.866
I am the Dean, and the Dean gets
what she wants, and I wanna remodel.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.496
You're just boring. I'm being honest.
I don't know what else to tell you.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.785
Gail: And I wanted my office done
for my meeting with guy Morgan...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.630
...the music mogul, but no.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.955
And using bollywood
as a theme for the dance?

04:14.171 --> 04:17.671
That's totally un-American.
I don't care if it was my idea.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.553
Guy: Hello.
Gail: Oh. Oh.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.432
I'm Dean Van ravensway,
and you must be--

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
-guy Morgan.
-Ah, yes. Guy Morgan, a pleasure.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.353
You look like a man who knows things.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.111
Aha, even some things I shouldn't know.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.074
-And I'm Luke.
Gail: Great.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.364
[Gail laughs]

04:37.528 --> 04:39.278
[Guy chuckles]

04:46.411 --> 04:47.451
[Gail clears throat]

04:47.663 --> 04:51.583
So tell me, guy, is it true?
Are you the new judge on idol?

04:51.792 --> 04:55.132
Well, let's just say
that Randy may be in the doghouse.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.167
-Now, let's talk about my son.
-Of course.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.761
-Have you reviewed your schedule, Luke?
-Yes, I have.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.467
In fact, um, I'd like to add a music class.
Um, the music theory--

05:03.679 --> 05:07.219
Wellesley has a great business program.
That's why we're here.

05:07.724 --> 05:12.604
There are two types of people
in the music biz: Artists and businessmen.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.653
-Luke is a businessman.
-Of course.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.148
Katie, get in here. Look alive.
Make yourself useful.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.954
Luke is gonna need a tour of the campus.

05:25.409 --> 05:30.499
So text bev and ask her
to escort Mr. Morgan around campus.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.879
Now, Luke, if you are half as talented
a producer as your father--

05:34.084 --> 05:37.174
the verdict's still out.
He hasn't earned it.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.049
Heard the story of how I started
in the music business?

05:41.258 --> 05:44.718
-Yes, everybody's heard it, dad.
-Then everybody should know how it goes.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.177
There I was,
working for the rolling stones...

05:49.391 --> 05:51.231
-...when Mick himself--
-dad.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.647
Fine. As I said,
the verdict is still out on my son.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.566
He just produced an album
with the fruity dangers?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.436
Do you mean danger fruit?

06:02.613 --> 06:04.363
That record was amazing.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.493
I forgot what they were called because
they made me absolutely no money.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.831
[Chuckles]

06:09.036 --> 06:11.446
Thank you. Rare I meet anyone
who's heard their album.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.543
What, are you kidding?
They're a cult phenomenon.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.420
I'm sorry. Why are you talking?

06:17.961 --> 06:23.471
Guy: What I need is for Luke to learn
to spot a commercially viable star.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.795
Image drives the bottom line, right?

06:26.011 --> 06:29.351
I feel you. Would we have bieber fever
if he were an ugly troll?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.676
Actually, he is a tad hobbit-like, isn't he?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.232
I'd like Luke
to produce your semester showcase...

06:34.436 --> 06:38.306
-...to see if he can identify sellable talent.
-I produce the semester showcase.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.573
I will double your showcase budget.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.449
I will invite every talent scout I know.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.118
This could be the beginning
of a relationship...

06:47.324 --> 06:49.244
...between Wellesley
and Kensington records.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.411
Looks like we have a new producer.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.580
Oh, and this is my daughter, bev.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.748
Bev, this is the platinum-selling,
grammy-winning...

06:57.960 --> 07:00.800
...and very handsome producer,
guy Morgan.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.804
Could you give his son, Luke, a tour?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.836
Sure. Would you like
to see the Wellesley perks?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.681
Um, yes, brilliant. Sure.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.815
-Katie.
Bev: I love your accent.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.895
Gail: Katie.
Bev: Wanna come over tonight?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.440
What are you still doing here? Go.

07:15.644 --> 07:19.024
Guy and I have things we need to discuss.
Out. Now.

07:19.648 --> 07:25.028
So, guy, you've gotta tell me,
what was that like working under Mick?

07:33.912 --> 07:35.622
Watch out.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.121
-Dangerous balls.
-Ha, ha. Thanks.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.666
-So you womanned up and did it?
Boy 1: Hey!

07:42.880 --> 07:44.670
-Oh, I did it.
Boy 1: Hey!

07:44.882 --> 07:47.182
-What happened?
Boy 2: Can we have our ball?

07:47.384 --> 07:48.724
I didn't give my cd to Luke.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.887
I snuck it in his dad's bag.

07:52.097 --> 07:56.017
But guy Morgan has your demo.
That's huge. What you need is a champion.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.976
No, what I need is to graduate.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.692
You giving our ball back or what?

08:00.898 --> 08:04.528
Oh, do you want this?

08:09.323 --> 08:12.533
She shoots, she scores.
Unlike you, soccer boy.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.833
[Chuckles]

08:14.912 --> 08:18.622
Oh, so spill it. Is Luke Morgan
as hot as everyone tweets he is?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.172
Hotter.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.955
You should ask him to the dance.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.379
Because I'm so forward with guys.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.128
First time for everything, right?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.934
-Hi, Luke.
-Hello.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.391
You have to hear my demo.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.901
It's a retro-funk-jazz explosion.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.234
Back off. I was here first.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.900
Hold on, hold up. Please hold on.
My boy does not want your demos yet.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.320
Walk away. Move along. Bye.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.910
It was nice chatting
or whatever that was.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.448
-Yes, hi, I'm, uh--
-Luke Morgan, right?

08:55.661 --> 08:57.161
Who is producing the showcase.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.291
I don't think I'm gonna do the showcase,
so I need to keep a low profile--

09:00.499 --> 09:03.839
yeah, yeah. Listen close now.
There's two kinds of people in this school.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.554
There are the wannabes
and there's gonnabes.

09:07.756 --> 09:12.886
You and I, we're gonnabes. What do we do?
We stay away from the wannabes, all right?

09:13.095 --> 09:16.605
And girls named yolanda. There are three
of them and they are certifiably--

09:16.807 --> 09:18.887
crazy? You attract
crazy women? Shocking.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.941
It may seem like I don't have game,
but ladies love a listener.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.265
Plus, I'm telling you,
let me help you find acts.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.861
-Ah, so you're a talent scout?
-Well, bottom line, I'm a dj.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.818
-Oh, you're a dj as well?
-Check this.

Okay, yes. You could be very useful.
It was nice meeting you.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.755
You got a girl for the dance?
Because I can hook you up.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.091
Uh, no. Thanks.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.626

about bev Van ravensway?

-Supposed to see her tonight.
-Bev?

09:52.634 --> 09:53.684
-Yeah.
-She's hot...

09:53.886 --> 09:56.296
...but the girl is mad, mad drama, okay?

and you don't even know my name.

-Om!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.861
This is not a contest, Ms. Gail.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.869
Just concentrate on your breathing.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.537
My butt is numb.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.039
If your butt is suffering,
then you are suffering.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.667
In fact, your entire life is suffering. Why?

10:25.876 --> 10:28.956
Because you crave
that which is meaningless.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.171
Are you calling me shallow?

10:32.216 --> 10:38.006
No, I'm saying to stop your craving
and release your butt.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.812
Just release it. Release it, yeah.
Release that butt.

of "if you interrupt my meditation...

10:52.861 --> 10:56.031
...i will jerk your tail in a knot"
do you not understand?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.620
You told me
to tell you when dinner was ready.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.245
Oh, thank god.

-Oh. Um, dinner's ready.
-Tell me something I don't know.

11:36.530 --> 11:40.950
Do you have any idea how stressful it is
to run this academy?

11:41.285 --> 11:43.795
Yes, I spent the money at the spa.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.460
Five thousand dollars a night
is not very expensive...

11:47.666 --> 11:52.246

which is me having a nervous breakdown.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.547
Ow.

I don't need your spiritual counseling.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.518
I'm thinking of firing you.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.357
Pace yourself, Ms. Gail,
or you will not be one with everything.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.912
Honey, that's what I got you for.
Now, make me one with everything.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.447
This showcase is giving me the vapors.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.753

24:51.325 --> 24:53.955
I need a girl who's not gonna be
shipped to the loony bin.

24:54.161 --> 24:55.871
Hang on, I'm gonna hit the facilities.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.789
Facilities. That's a new one.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.878
-Hey, man. Sorry we're late.
-Hey, what's good, y'all?

25:01.084 --> 25:03.804
Nobody talks to my boy
until he comes from the facilities.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.174
We're here to impress.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.630
-This way, right? All right.
-Guys?

25:11.470 --> 25:13.890
[Singing]
When you're fighting just to keep it sane

25:14.097 --> 25:16.347
throw your will
at the eye of the hurricane

25:16.558 --> 25:18.728
-sing it out
-eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh

25:18.936 --> 25:22.226
-help me sing it out
-eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh

25:22.439 --> 25:24.939
if you wanna find out who you are
stop running

25:25.150 --> 25:28.400
in the end you'll figure out
it's all about nothing

25:28.612 --> 25:33.872
all night, it's gonna be all right
hey, hey, hey, hey

25:34.076 --> 25:40.786
all right
turn your dreams into your life

25:42.000 --> 25:43.500
that's good.

25:50.551 --> 25:53.851
I'm clean. No one followed me.
And I got your intel.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.970
Oh, Katie, baby, your life sucks.

25:57.182 --> 25:59.102
Trust me, it gets worse.

26:00.143 --> 26:03.693
Okay, dude, those guys, they
just went oral majority on me in there--

26:03.897 --> 26:06.067
-i was trying to hold them back--
-you're right.

26:06.275 --> 26:08.155
They have potential and they're great.

26:08.360 --> 26:13.570
But first, my talent-finding friend,
promise me no more auditions in the bogs.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.992
-The what?
-The loo.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.243
-Bathroom. Toilet.
-Got it.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.043
All right. Okay, come on.
I wanna show you something.

26:21.665 --> 26:25.345
So now I have to rehearse in secret.

26:25.544 --> 26:26.634
Why not, not rehearse?

26:26.837 --> 26:28.757
Make bev sound bad. What do you care?

26:28.964 --> 26:31.974
No song, no savings account. No life.

26:32.426 --> 26:33.926
[Chattering and laughing]

26:34.136 --> 26:36.546
Angela:
People. Coming. Now.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.940
Okay.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.849
Dude, what are we doing?
The suspense is killing me.

26:45.189 --> 26:46.939
Luke:
Can you grab the Mike?

26:47.149 --> 26:49.109
Not about to serenade
a brother, are you?

26:49.318 --> 26:51.108
Luke:
Dude, with bromance, comes a fine line.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.610
Mickey:
That I shall not cross.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.372
So sing something.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.545
Luke:
Okay.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.715
[Playing upbeat melody]

27:03.665 --> 27:06.415
[Singing] I'm lost in a world
that rattles my brain

27:06.627 --> 27:09.087
I'm cleaning up my life
from the mess you made

27:09.296 --> 27:10.706
oh, oh

27:11.173 --> 27:13.173
whoa, oh, oh, oh

27:14.968 --> 27:17.388
my soul's in debt, but my bills are paid

27:17.596 --> 27:20.096
I'd give anything just to make an escape

27:20.307 --> 27:21.887
oh, oh

27:22.392 --> 27:24.062
whoa, oh, oh, oh

27:25.062 --> 27:27.942
so you can keep
knocking, knocking, knocking

27:28.148 --> 27:30.478
baby, you're rockin'
but there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in

27:30.692 --> 27:32.112
[mouths]
He's amazing.

27:33.529 --> 27:35.199
Not again

27:36.114 --> 27:38.914
so keep on
knocking, knocking, knocking

27:39.117 --> 27:44.287
but, baby, you're better off walking
'cause I ain't gonna let you in

27:44.498 --> 27:46.078
never again

27:47.167 --> 27:49.707
I went out on a limb again

27:49.920 --> 27:52.460
I guess I had to lose to win

27:52.673 --> 27:56.973
I was too confused to know
which way to turn

27:57.177 --> 27:58.217
[cell phone beeps]

27:58.428 --> 28:01.058
-And she could be a millionaire....
-Crap.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.525
-Gail needs me to drive her home.
-I don't care

28:03.725 --> 28:06.345
'cause, baby, there's nobody home

28:06.562 --> 28:09.062
nobody's home at all, yeah

28:12.276 --> 28:13.316
[Mickey laughs]

28:13.527 --> 28:15.607
-What? Did you write that?
-Yeah.

28:15.821 --> 28:18.411
Reminds me of, um.... uh....

28:18.615 --> 28:21.945
-Danger fruit, right? Danger fruit.
-Ha, ha. Because I wrote their album too.

28:22.244 --> 28:24.704
Shut up. Took me forever
to find that bootleg online.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.873
-I love that album. That's crazy.
-Yeah.

28:27.082 --> 28:29.332
My dad doesn't know.
And he thought the record...

28:29.543 --> 28:31.253
...was a pile of crap.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.213
He thinks writing's a waste of time.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.470
Because he basically wants me
to be like him. Only with better hair.

28:37.968 --> 28:42.008
But the first thing I thought when
i heard those guys in the urinals was...

28:42.222 --> 28:43.262
...good acoustics.

28:43.640 --> 28:48.020
Second thought was these guys,
these guys could be great, if--

28:48.228 --> 28:49.268
you gave them your song.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.317
Mate, that's a brilliant idea.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.736
-So put them in the showcase?
-Put them in the showcase.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.244
Mickey:
Yeah.

28:57.446 --> 28:58.776
[Katie playing guitar and singing]

28:58.989 --> 29:05.499
You can never tell where this might go

29:05.787 --> 29:07.037
you wrote that song today?

29:07.247 --> 29:10.707
-You've been home for what, two hours?
-It's like an answer to his song.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.251
You really like this guy.

29:12.461 --> 29:14.131
Yeah, I'm an idiot.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.918
You have to sing that for him.

29:17.132 --> 29:20.182
What if you sang to him in secret?

29:22.012 --> 29:24.812
At the dance. Ta-da.

29:28.393 --> 29:31.233
Okay, I know the card's
like, really cheesy, but....

29:33.273 --> 29:35.733
Oh, god, I hope you like it.

29:36.068 --> 29:39.528
Ange, it's beautiful,
but are you crazy?

29:39.738 --> 29:41.738
No, I know you're crazy.

29:41.949 --> 29:42.989
Am not.

29:44.034 --> 29:47.004
-What if he doesn't even like me?
-You'll both be in disguise.

29:47.204 --> 29:49.834
It's your chance to see
if he was really flirting with you.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.580
I was naked. Of course he was flirting.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.463
And why even torture myself?
It's not like I can have him.

29:55.671 --> 29:57.551
Why not? Tell him how you feel.

29:57.756 --> 30:01.796
If he feels the same way, you can reveal
your hot self and he won't tell Gail.

30:02.177 --> 30:05.257
And if he hates the song,
leave the disguise on.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.735
Okay.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.600
I'm going to the dance.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.152
That's my girl.

30:13.397 --> 30:17.357
Maurice, no, no.
Again, in français, longer legs.

30:17.568 --> 30:20.858
I wouldn't go in your closet
for a little while, if I were you.

30:21.071 --> 30:22.781
What? Why?

30:22.990 --> 30:24.370
Hey. Wake up.

30:28.245 --> 30:29.795
Gail:
Katie!

30:29.997 --> 30:33.377
The cat has pooped in my closet.
I need you to clean it up.

30:33.584 --> 30:35.044
Go.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.962
I told you we don't have a cat.

30:37.171 --> 30:38.511
Angie, heads up.

30:40.465 --> 30:41.755
Katie!

30:46.972 --> 30:48.682
What's going on?

30:48.891 --> 30:50.271
Nothing.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.555
I am, uh, re-organizing and labeling. I....

30:53.770 --> 30:56.060
I took up crochet.
Do you want new socks?

30:56.273 --> 31:00.323
I would make you a sweater, but I hear
that the arms, that they're really hard.

31:03.572 --> 31:07.702
Oh, you thought you could sneak off
and go to the dance.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.080
After what you pulled today with guy.

31:10.287 --> 31:11.707
Oh, no, no.

31:11.914 --> 31:14.374
Oh, no, no, no.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.843
You're on Victor watch tonight...

31:17.044 --> 31:19.674
...tomorrow night and every night.

31:19.880 --> 31:20.920
Fun.

31:21.131 --> 31:24.221
I'll give Victor all the mothering
you don't have time for.

31:24.426 --> 31:27.796
Oh, I wish you could be my mommy.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.720
I'm off to my cinnamon colonic.

31:31.475 --> 31:33.735
[Hip-hop music playing on stereo]

31:34.686 --> 31:37.056
Katie: Hey. Get down.
You're gonna break yourself.

31:37.397 --> 31:39.647
Or worse, the furniture.

31:39.983 --> 31:43.073
Angela: Hello?
-Hey.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.490
-You look like you're having fun.
-Always.

31:46.823 --> 31:49.873
Well, I couldn't let you not go to the dance
without me.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.447
Besides, we have six hours
of shirtless team Jacob.

31:52.663 --> 31:55.543
So let's just get this party started.

31:55.749 --> 31:59.789
-So is Victor driving you nuts?
-I swear to you, he's not human.

32:00.045 --> 32:03.335
I mean, can you really blame him, though?
Just look at his family.

32:04.550 --> 32:05.800
Victor, what are you doing?

32:06.009 --> 32:07.839
[Yells]

32:13.308 --> 32:14.478
[Laughs]

32:15.853 --> 32:18.063
Oh, no. Great.

32:18.272 --> 32:20.482
Eh, she actually looks prettier
that way.

32:21.066 --> 32:24.106
Katie:
True. Ugh. Whatever.

32:25.279 --> 32:28.409
Why did I ever think that tonight
could've been something special?

32:29.199 --> 32:31.409
Think bev's all over Luke at the dance
right now?

32:31.618 --> 32:33.868
They're probably making out. See?

32:34.079 --> 32:37.289
-Victor, give it a rest.
-Just check it out. Come on.

32:40.502 --> 32:43.092
Luke is gonna produce
whoever wins this showcase.

32:43.297 --> 32:46.337
So we need a little insurance.

32:46.550 --> 32:49.720
-I know what I'm doing, mother.
Gail: Do you?

32:50.637 --> 32:53.467
I can't take it anymore, okay?

32:53.682 --> 32:55.682
I'm taking my life into my own hands.

32:55.893 --> 32:57.023
I'm talking to Luke.

32:57.603 --> 33:00.063
-Finally.
-Okay, but we have gotta be home...

33:00.272 --> 33:01.732
...before Gail gets here.

33:02.482 --> 33:03.782
What about the demon spawn?

Mm-hm.

All right. All right. Don't hate me.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.445
Okay, don't hate me. I'm sorry.

33:39.645 --> 33:43.025
But my name ain't ravi. It's Tony.

-Tony.
-Tony gupta from Jersey.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.530
-From Jersey.
-I am half Indian.

33:49.905 --> 33:53.245
My friends call me meatball
because the other half is Italian.

Truth is I always wanted to be an actor.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.202
But I never got my shot.

I'm working at kfc,
and one day, Gail comes in...

33:59.790 --> 34:02.170
...she's like, "are you Indian?"
I'm like, "what?"

34:02.376 --> 34:04.536
She's like, "are you a guru?"
I'm like:

[In Indian accent]
"Who is asking?"

34:06.505 --> 34:09.845
[In normal voice] She says, "someone
who's paying for some spiritual guidance."

And I'm like, "whaa! It's a miracle!"

a total immersion into a character.

It would start out at 90 degrees.

51:47.149 --> 51:51.649
And then it would just take you somewhere
that you never expected you would go.

51:53.071 --> 51:54.111
[Chuckles]

51:54.323 --> 51:56.783
-Doesn't really make any sense, does it?
-Not at all.

51:56.992 --> 51:59.122
Maybe you could just ask me
another question.

51:59.328 --> 52:01.998
I wasn't kidding when I said
we should write together.

52:02.206 --> 52:03.536
That's not a question.

52:03.749 --> 52:04.789
[Chuckles]

52:05.000 --> 52:06.130
Oh, okay.

52:06.335 --> 52:09.005
Um, how about what inspires you
to write music?

52:10.130 --> 52:12.170
What inspires me?
That's a good question.

52:13.842 --> 52:17.142
You know, I would have to say--
it would be, um....

52:18.931 --> 52:20.181
Inspiration!

52:21.058 --> 52:22.518
Oh. Wow. Ahem.

52:22.726 --> 52:25.146
You know,
inspiration is such a deeply, uh--

52:25.354 --> 52:30.734
it's personal. It's, like, kind of indefinable,
i guess you could say.

52:33.529 --> 52:36.029
It's just personal. Oh, my god.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.160
-I'm so sorry.
Luke: No, you're okay. Um....

52:39.368 --> 52:41.948
Bev: Did it get on your jacket?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

52:42.162 --> 52:44.162
Luke: No, you know what? You're fine.
It's just--

52:44.373 --> 52:45.543
oh, no. Uh....

52:45.749 --> 52:49.339
-Is grandma okay?
-Uh, no. Um, she has to go to the bathroom.

52:49.545 --> 52:52.425
-Oh, she does tell you everything.
Bev: I should go to the bathroom too.

52:52.631 --> 52:53.671
[Chuckles]

52:53.882 --> 52:55.722
I'll be right back.

52:59.221 --> 53:02.521
What are you doing? Get back out there.
This is working like a charm.

53:02.724 --> 53:05.524
What do you want me to do?
Send smoke signals?

53:05.727 --> 53:08.937
-No.
-Look, you can go back in there, okay?

53:09.147 --> 53:11.517
But you are so in over your head
you don't even know it.

53:11.733 --> 53:12.983
No, I'm not. You know what?

53:13.193 --> 53:15.453
I'm so sick of using your words.
I don't need you.

53:15.654 --> 53:17.704
I can do this on my own.
Luke wants me.

53:17.906 --> 53:19.736
I talk good.

53:20.534 --> 53:21.914
Hey, good luck.

53:25.956 --> 53:27.866
-Hi.
-Sorry.

53:28.083 --> 53:31.843
So let's talk classical music.
Who are your favorites?

53:32.045 --> 53:33.085
Mozart.

53:33.630 --> 53:34.960
Beethoven?

53:35.257 --> 53:37.587
Tchaikovsky. You are a swan lake girl,
aren't you?

53:38.302 --> 53:41.222
-I have bad news. My grandma croaked.
-Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

53:41.430 --> 53:43.810
-I should go.
-Look, if you wanna talk about it, i--

53:44.016 --> 53:47.846
you know, I would prefer to remember
my grandma's memory in silence.

53:49.188 --> 53:50.728
[Giggles]

53:52.524 --> 53:53.944
Crap.

54:02.034 --> 54:03.244
Mah-meh, mah-meh.

54:03.452 --> 54:06.752
Gail: Victor, if you have stolen my
commemorative Gandhi knife again...

54:06.955 --> 54:08.615
...i will make you into a eunuch.

54:11.335 --> 54:13.595
You were supposed to be
watching Victor.

54:13.795 --> 54:16.085
You told me you wanted the chandelier
to sparkle.

54:16.298 --> 54:19.798
Now I want you to throw out
my facelessness.

54:31.813 --> 54:33.653
[Doorbell rings]

54:37.819 --> 54:39.649
Victor, is bev in?

54:40.155 --> 54:44.485
[Singing] I'll tell you
when you can guess what song I'm playing

54:44.910 --> 54:45.990
is bev in?

54:46.203 --> 54:47.543
Guess what song!

54:47.746 --> 54:49.826
It doesn't sound like anything
I've ever heard!

54:50.040 --> 54:54.380
That's because I don't know how to play!
We could be here all day!

54:54.586 --> 54:56.416
Well, I could show you some chords!

54:58.340 --> 55:01.050
-I thought you wanted to see bev.
-Bev can wait a sec.

55:01.426 --> 55:02.546
-Okay.
-Yeah?

55:02.761 --> 55:05.141
Now, I'm gonna show you three chords.

55:05.347 --> 55:07.307
-And we're gonna turn it into a song.
-Okay.

55:07.516 --> 55:09.176
This is the first chord.

55:09.810 --> 55:11.270
It's an e.

55:11.562 --> 55:13.692
All right. Second chord.

55:14.523 --> 55:16.023
Go to g. Slide it up.

55:17.401 --> 55:18.861
Oh, yeah. Okay.

55:19.069 --> 55:22.069
There we go.
Slide it up again. You got an a.

55:22.447 --> 55:24.027
There. We're gonna put it together.

55:24.241 --> 55:25.871
-It's gonna be a whole song.
-Okay.

55:30.706 --> 55:31.826
Now.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.670
[Playing chords]

55:54.313 --> 55:57.403
Very good. You can play, you rascal.

55:57.608 --> 56:00.778
If you practice and with that haircut,
you could be a beatle.

56:00.986 --> 56:03.236
No, the stones are a lot better.

56:05.115 --> 56:07.115
-Luke.
-Hey.

56:07.326 --> 56:08.986
Katie: Hi.
-I keep running into you here.

56:09.203 --> 56:10.953
But no partial nudity this time.

56:11.163 --> 56:14.213
Um, I didn't know you and bev
had a date today.

56:14.416 --> 56:16.376
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm kind of surprising her.

56:16.585 --> 56:19.005
I'll go get her.

56:20.797 --> 56:22.297
He's crazy.

56:22.508 --> 56:24.128
So it looks like she lost her head.

56:24.676 --> 56:28.966
Oh. Yeah, it's an artist's rendition
of what's going on up there.

56:30.849 --> 56:32.269
You play a Gallagher?

56:32.935 --> 56:33.985
That is so cool.

56:34.186 --> 56:36.096
-You know guitars.
-No. Uh-uh.

56:38.190 --> 56:41.360
I mean, yeah, a little. Not really.

56:41.777 --> 56:46.697
Yeah, I know. I like the way the, um--
the rosewood holds the, uh....

56:48.158 --> 56:50.618
-The notes.
-Notes.

56:51.078 --> 56:52.118
Notes, yeah. Um....

56:53.705 --> 56:57.205
You always seem to disappear.
I really wish you wouldn't.

56:58.335 --> 56:59.955
You're actually quite cool.

57:00.754 --> 57:01.804
You think I'm cool?

57:04.132 --> 57:06.762
Luke. Hi.

57:06.969 --> 57:08.009
-What a surprise.
-Um--

57:08.220 --> 57:11.060
-oh, god, I love your skinny jeans.
-Oh, thank you. Uh....

57:12.057 --> 57:14.347
I brought my guitar.
We could write that song.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.310
-Awesome. Yeah.
-Okay.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.900
Oh, yeah. I guess I gotta go disappear.

57:20.482 --> 57:23.822
And can you just wait in there
for one minute?

57:24.027 --> 57:25.817
Thanks.

57:34.663 --> 57:36.793
-I need your new song.
-What? I'm not done yet.

57:36.999 --> 57:38.289
Give me what you have so far.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.710
-Come on.
-Don't break my heart.

57:40.919 --> 57:42.709
I will break more than that.

57:42.921 --> 57:44.671
-No, that's the Lyric.
-What?

57:45.465 --> 57:46.505
That's it?

57:46.842 --> 57:50.302
You have had forever to work on this.
Oh, my god, you're giving me a twitch.

57:50.512 --> 57:51.852
[Bev panting]

57:52.222 --> 57:53.682
Fine.

57:58.353 --> 57:59.403
Bev:
Victor?

57:59.605 --> 58:01.195
-Victor.
-Victor.

58:01.857 --> 58:03.817
Bev:
I know you're there.

58:10.574 --> 58:14.334
You're trespassing
and you've just entered a world of hurt.

58:14.536 --> 58:16.996
Yeah, well, I know all about
your surveillance crap, Victor.

58:17.206 --> 58:19.706
Your cameras hidden in every nook
and cranny, I know.

58:19.958 --> 58:22.918
-What kinds of nooks and crannies?
-You can't prove anything.

58:23.128 --> 58:26.088
Well, I won't tell mom
if you do me a favor.

58:27.049 --> 58:28.929
I need Katie to talk to me
with no one knowing.

58:29.134 --> 58:31.264
-No one can hear her. She can hear me.
[Mouths] Don't.

58:31.470 --> 58:34.220
-Is it possible?
-Say no.

58:35.557 --> 58:36.887
You've come to the right man.

58:37.309 --> 58:39.809
Watch and learn, ladies.

58:43.065 --> 58:44.695
[Beeping]

58:47.986 --> 58:49.396
I can hide a Mike anywhere.

58:50.197 --> 58:51.237
Mom swallowed one.

58:51.448 --> 58:53.738
And you don't wanna hear the live feed,
trust me.

58:53.951 --> 58:55.241
Oh, this is insane.

58:55.744 --> 58:57.084
I guarantee my work.

58:57.371 --> 58:59.211
-Hey, Victor, set up Katie.
-Okay.

58:59.414 --> 59:01.214
Here you go, Katie.

59:02.459 --> 59:04.209
I put this in my ear?

59:04.419 --> 59:07.459
You put it on your ear and you talk.

59:08.924 --> 59:11.264
Well, you are ugly,
you could probably fit all it in there.

59:11.969 --> 59:13.929
Luke, I'm so sorry.

59:14.179 --> 59:16.559
I have to give Katie a sisterly talk,
you know.

59:16.765 --> 59:18.635
She's so high-maintenance. Ha, ha.

59:18.851 --> 59:20.811
Anyway, well, where were we?

59:21.019 --> 59:22.349
Uh, well, we hadn't started.

59:22.563 --> 59:24.563
-Perfect. Let's start.
Katie: Bev.

59:24.773 --> 59:26.233
Uh, bev, hey, can you hear me?

59:26.441 --> 59:27.611
What do you wanna start with?

59:27.818 --> 59:28.858
-Katie: Bev?
-Yes.

59:29.069 --> 59:31.199
-What?
-What? Ha.

59:31.405 --> 59:33.325
Luke:
You wanna sing and I'll play Harmony?

59:33.532 --> 59:35.742
Uh, no.
I was thinking maybe you could sing...

59:35.951 --> 59:38.161
...and I could give you some lyrics
that I wrote.

59:38.370 --> 59:39.750
Luke:
That sounds good, okay.

59:39.955 --> 59:42.085
-I.... um....
Bev: I'll just write them down.

59:42.291 --> 59:43.881
They are, um.... um....

59:45.627 --> 59:46.797
Don't break my heart.

59:47.504 --> 59:48.884
Don't break my heart.

59:50.132 --> 59:51.842
Before I give it to you.

59:52.176 --> 59:53.636
Before I give it to you.

59:53.844 --> 59:56.304
Don't break my heart
before I give it to you, okay.

59:56.597 --> 59:59.517
Katie: Don't tell me no.
-Don't tell me no.

1:00:00.976 --> 1:00:02.346
Before I ask you to.

1:00:02.561 --> 1:00:04.191
Bev:
Before I ask you to.

1:00:04.396 --> 1:00:06.226
Don't tell me no, before I ask you to.

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:07.900
-Yeah.
-That's good. Um....

1:00:08.233 --> 1:00:09.283
Thanks.

1:00:09.484 --> 1:00:11.444
Luke:
Don't break my heart.

[Humming]

1:00:14.573 --> 1:00:15.823
Luke:
More?

1:00:16.033 --> 1:00:17.333
Don't say it doesn't fit.

1:00:17.534 --> 1:00:19.164
Don't say it doesn't fit.

1:00:19.661 --> 1:00:21.121
Before you try it on.

1:00:21.330 --> 1:00:22.790
Before you try it on.

1:00:22.998 --> 1:00:25.538
Don't say it doesn't fit
before you try it on.

1:00:25.751 --> 1:00:26.841
Bev:
Try it on.

1:00:27.044 --> 1:00:28.924
-I like it.
-Thanks. Ha, ha.

1:00:30.255 --> 1:00:33.625
Um, there's too much to lose.

1:00:33.842 --> 1:00:36.302
-There's so much to lose.
Katie: Too much to lose.

1:00:36.512 --> 1:00:38.302
Too much to lose.

1:00:38.514 --> 1:00:40.144
Katie: To be wrong.
-To be wrong.

1:00:40.349 --> 1:00:44.889
Too much to lose to be wrong.

1:00:45.103 --> 1:00:47.813
-Yeah. That's good.
Bev: Yeah.

1:00:48.482 --> 1:00:49.522
More? You got any more?

1:00:49.733 --> 1:00:52.573
Bev: Yeah.
-And it feels like there's something here.

1:00:53.195 --> 1:00:56.075
Bev: And it feels like
there's something here.

1:00:56.657 --> 1:00:58.367
And it feels like there's something here.

1:00:58.575 --> 1:01:01.785
But I wanna see it before it disappears.

1:01:02.246 --> 1:01:05.616
But I wanna see it
before it disappears.

1:01:08.794 --> 1:01:10.004
-Yeah.
Bev: Do you like that?

1:01:10.212 --> 1:01:11.252
[Bev chuckles]

1:01:11.463 --> 1:01:14.383
And if there's something real
between me and you.

1:01:14.716 --> 1:01:18.426
Bev: And if there's something real
between me and you.

1:01:18.637 --> 1:01:22.967
Luke: If there's something real between--
-or are we both open to?

1:01:26.895 --> 1:01:30.685
[Singing]
Don't break my heart before I give it to you

1:01:31.692 --> 1:01:35.362
don't tell me no before I ask you to

1:01:36.530 --> 1:01:40.490
don't say it doesn't fit before you try it on

1:01:40.701 --> 1:01:44.331
there's too much to lose to be wrong

1:01:45.664 --> 1:01:49.084
and it feels like there's something here

1:01:50.419 --> 1:01:54.959
but I wanna see it before it disappears

1:01:55.174 --> 1:01:59.894
and if there's something real
between me and you

1:02:00.095 --> 1:02:04.055
well, are we both open to

1:02:04.266 --> 1:02:08.396
all these possibilities

1:02:08.604 --> 1:02:13.234
so many little possibilities

1:02:25.037 --> 1:02:27.117
Katie: Who wants pie?
Both: Ugh!

1:02:27.789 --> 1:02:30.249
Sorry. Um, I was just gonna go
get some pie and thinking:

1:02:30.459 --> 1:02:34.549
"Why should I get pie for myself? There
might be other people that want some pie."

1:02:34.796 --> 1:02:35.836
I want pie.

1:02:36.048 --> 1:02:38.928
No, Katie, there's no pie needs here
at the moment. Thank you.

1:02:39.134 --> 1:02:40.264
You know what? I should go.

1:02:40.469 --> 1:02:43.559
Um, I've got some acts to finalize
for the showcase so I'll, uh--

1:02:43.764 --> 1:02:46.604
we were singing.
And we were doing things.

1:02:46.808 --> 1:02:48.768
And it was amazing. All of it.

1:02:48.977 --> 1:02:51.397
And I'll catch you later, okay?

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.055
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1:02:53.273 --> 1:02:55.153
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

1:03:06.662 --> 1:03:08.122

1:03:23.387 --> 1:03:24.797
[Katie shrieks]

1:03:25.681 --> 1:03:26.971
What are you doing in my bed?

1:03:27.182 --> 1:03:32.442
While waiting for you,
i meditated so strenuously that I fell asleep.

1:03:32.646 --> 1:03:36.606
[As ravi] Mr. Victor,
time for your weekly meditation.

1:03:37.234 --> 1:03:41.994
Today, we are working on, uh,
silence and potty training.

1:03:42.197 --> 1:03:44.237
Gail [Over monitor]:
Oh, sit.

1:03:45.742 --> 1:03:46.912
I said sit.

1:03:47.119 --> 1:03:50.369
What in the name of bhuvaneshwari?

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:53.076
[Gail clears throat]

1:03:54.293 --> 1:03:55.543
Holy cow.

1:03:55.752 --> 1:03:58.882
Uh, a bottle of wine ago,
i was gonna be sweet as sugar...

1:03:59.089 --> 1:04:03.839
...and apologize for living up
to the stereotype of stepmotherhood.

1:04:04.052 --> 1:04:05.222
Dumb.

1:04:05.470 --> 1:04:10.230
You know, by making you watch
my real daughter steal the boy you like...

1:04:10.434 --> 1:04:11.774
...and the song you wrote.

1:04:12.102 --> 1:04:13.482
You're saying you're sorry?

1:04:13.687 --> 1:04:16.227
Oh, bless your heart. No, no, no.

1:04:16.857 --> 1:04:22.277
I came to my senses and I realized
it was better to just tell you the truth.

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:25.910
You are never gonna amount
to anything.

1:04:26.116 --> 1:04:28.236
My mom is a beyotch.

1:04:28.452 --> 1:04:31.252
And you're a sneaky, sneaky spy,
Mr. Victor.

1:04:31.455 --> 1:04:32.875
How many cameras do you have?

1:04:33.081 --> 1:04:35.751
Enough to know your accent's
faker than my mom's soul.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:39.419
Oh, and don't get the dumb idea
to throw that showcase.

1:04:39.630 --> 1:04:40.920
Because I talked to a lawyer.

1:04:41.131 --> 1:04:45.761
And he found a loophole that allows me
to access that money your daddy left you...

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:48.509
...should I need it for a medical reason.

1:04:48.722 --> 1:04:51.562
You know, hello, longer legs.

1:04:51.767 --> 1:04:55.437
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Before you go--
-I'll sing for bev. Don't worry.

1:04:55.896 --> 1:04:57.896
Well, that was easier than I thought.

1:04:58.106 --> 1:04:59.936
Now, go and make me a vodka tonic.

1:05:00.150 --> 1:05:01.690
Hold the tonic.

[In normal voice]
Her reign of terror's gotta stop.

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.080
I'm in. What do we do?

1:05:15.290 --> 1:05:17.130
Look, there's nothing you can do.

1:05:17.793 --> 1:05:20.133
If you try to help,
it's just gonna make it worse.

1:05:20.337 --> 1:05:23.297
That woman is a demon
spawned from darkness itself.

1:05:23.507 --> 1:05:24.837

Hello, Ms. Gail.

1:05:27.010 --> 1:05:30.390
Have you, uh, released your mind
from the shackles of thinking today?

1:05:30.597 --> 1:05:32.517
-I'm working on it.
-Very good.

1:05:32.766 --> 1:05:35.516
-How was your meditation?
Gail: I hate you.

1:05:35.853 --> 1:05:38.103
Very good. You look pretty.

1:05:38.313 --> 1:05:40.023
I know.

1:05:41.692 --> 1:05:44.492
[In normal voice] That broad
ain't getting away with ruining your life.

1:05:44.695 --> 1:05:46.325
I'm pooping in her bed tonight.

1:05:46.530 --> 1:05:49.320
Victor, I thought you hated me.

1:05:49.533 --> 1:05:50.583
Are you an idiot?

1:05:50.784 --> 1:05:52.914
You're the only person
who knows my birthday.

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:54.950
The only one who says goodnight
to me.

1:05:55.163 --> 1:05:57.963
The only one who makes me
Mac and cheese.

1:05:58.167 --> 1:05:59.877
You're annoying and ugly...

1:06:00.085 --> 1:06:01.495
...but I sort of love you.

1:06:03.922 --> 1:06:05.552
I sort of love you too.

1:06:06.175 --> 1:06:10.645
But just promise me
you're not gonna do anything, okay?

1:06:11.096 --> 1:06:12.676
-You too.
-Oh, come on.

1:06:12.890 --> 1:06:14.770
-Just-- no-- ple--
-just-- no. Just--

1:06:14.975 --> 1:06:16.485
-no. Tony.
-Just one--

1:06:17.394 --> 1:06:18.734
okay.

1:06:18.979 --> 1:06:23.399
All right.
Well, now I get to go fold bev's delicates.

-Have you ever heard of knocking?
-Ever heard of I don't care?

1:06:42.794 --> 1:06:44.924
Where'd you put my blue blouse?

1:06:45.130 --> 1:06:47.220
Oh, okay.

1:06:47.424 --> 1:06:49.934
Okay, which one of these
do you like better?

1:06:50.844 --> 1:06:54.764
-You actually want my opinion?
-God, I know. What's wrong with me?

1:06:55.724 --> 1:06:59.564
You know how you're a bitch and I act
like I don't care, but truth is I'm sensitive?

1:06:59.770 --> 1:07:02.270
-Actually--
-i need someone to talk to like a sister...

1:07:02.481 --> 1:07:04.401
...and you're better than nothing.

1:07:05.859 --> 1:07:10.279
I'm nervous about tonight.
Oh, my god, why did I just tell you that?

1:07:12.157 --> 1:07:14.277
I don't know.

1:07:14.618 --> 1:07:16.828
It's like my whole body is freaking out.

1:07:17.037 --> 1:07:18.077
I have hives on my butt.

1:07:18.288 --> 1:07:20.748
I can't tell mom
and I can't talk to Luke about it.

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:22.208
He'll say something like:

1:07:22.417 --> 1:07:25.377
[In English accent] "Oh, one minute
you're talented and we're connecting...

1:07:25.587 --> 1:07:28.757
...and the next minute you're self-involved
and histrionic."

1:07:28.966 --> 1:07:32.216
-What does that even mean? I hate history.
-He said that?

1:07:34.054 --> 1:07:37.894
Listen, toadie, he's not falling for you,
he's falling for me.

1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:39.770
I just don't know who me is anymore.

1:07:39.977 --> 1:07:42.227
Why are you nervous?
You're not really singing.

1:07:42.437 --> 1:07:45.477
All you have to do is stand there
and look pretty.

1:07:47.067 --> 1:07:49.897
Have you ever thought
about how that makes me feel?

1:07:50.696 --> 1:07:52.106
You have talent.

1:07:52.322 --> 1:07:55.832
You could go on American idol
and forget about the rest of us.

1:07:56.076 --> 1:07:58.406
This is, like, my only chance.

1:07:59.121 --> 1:08:00.791
Pretty doesn't last very long.

1:08:00.998 --> 1:08:02.958
Just look at mom.

1:08:05.127 --> 1:08:06.247
You think I'm talented?

1:08:08.046 --> 1:08:10.166
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it.

1:08:11.842 --> 1:08:13.342
Wear the blue blouse.

1:08:13.552 --> 1:08:15.512
It makes your eyes pop.

Bev never sang at all?

1:15:25.776 --> 1:15:27.026
[Music resumes and crowd cheers]

1:15:27.236 --> 1:15:30.566
And she's about to not sing
for a whole bunch of people, so please--

1:15:30.781 --> 1:15:33.951
and on the dates, that-- that was you.

1:15:38.413 --> 1:15:40.543
[Singing]
I got nothing to lose

1:15:41.041 --> 1:15:42.381
I've been exposed

1:15:42.584 --> 1:15:44.674
I'm paying my dues

1:15:44.878 --> 1:15:45.998
playing the role

1:15:46.213 --> 1:15:48.553
I'm breaking the rules

1:15:48.757 --> 1:15:49.917
flow in the flow

1:15:50.133 --> 1:15:51.303
my camera!

1:15:51.510 --> 1:15:54.050

I'll break a sweat

1:15:56.807 --> 1:15:57.847
if you want it

1:15:58.058 --> 1:16:00.098
confess all your sins

1:16:00.310 --> 1:16:01.600
you know you got 'em

1:16:01.812 --> 1:16:04.022
the room's in a spin

1:16:04.231 --> 1:16:05.271
the fever's pitched

1:16:05.482 --> 1:16:07.442
-you gotta go. Come on, get out there.
Katie: Aah!

1:16:07.651 --> 1:16:09.321
I'm legit, I'm no counterfeit

1:16:09.528 --> 1:16:13.948
I'll make you believe in me

1:16:14.157 --> 1:16:16.907

1:16:42.644 --> 1:16:44.654
[crowd cheering]

1:16:48.901 --> 1:16:50.691
That's what I'm talking about.

1:16:52.529 --> 1:16:54.989

1:17:10.923 --> 1:17:12.223

1:17:26.813 --> 1:17:28.523
[Playing upbeat rock]

1:17:34.321 --> 1:17:38.321
There's a little secret
i would like to tell you

1:17:41.411 --> 1:17:46.081
there's a book of lies
i know they'll try to sell you

1:17:47.292 --> 1:17:50.842

to convince you to buy

1:17:51.046 --> 1:17:52.546
you need them

1:17:54.508 --> 1:17:57.888
so the next time you're down
look inside, not around

1:17:58.095 --> 1:18:01.225
I can dress myself

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:04.351
there's no need for someone's help

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.140
there's no one to blame

1:18:06.353 --> 1:18:12.073

'cause I have blessed myself

1:18:29.418 --> 1:18:36.258
do you ever wonder
how anything can make you cry?

1:18:36.466 --> 1:18:40.096
Have yourself discover

1:18:40.304 --> 1:18:47.274
that the pain you feel
is the pain that you deny

1:18:47.477 --> 1:18:50.687
you can bless yourself

1:18:50.898 --> 1:18:53.778
there's no need for someone else

1:20:03.387 --> 1:20:07.137

the next big album for Kensington records.

1:20:09.101 --> 1:20:10.891

Guy! Wait!

1:20:59.818 --> 1:21:03.278
-What now, Gail? More lies?
-Well, everyone lies in this business.

1:21:03.488 --> 1:21:04.528
It's called spin.

1:21:05.157 --> 1:21:06.487
So bev can't sing.

1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:08.410
That didn't stop Jessica Simpson.

1:21:08.619 --> 1:21:12.209
Well, we'll see what the school board
thinks when I give them a ring, shall we?

1:21:12.581 --> 1:21:15.331
How dare you? Teaching is my life.

1:21:15.542 --> 1:21:17.462
