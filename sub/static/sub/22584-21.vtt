00:02.320 --> 00:04.356
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:04.480 --> 00:07.995
Today, we have assembled
representatives of numerous worlds...

00:08.119 --> 00:10.588
to forge an unprecedented alliance.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.594
It's almost possible to forget
what she represents.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.598
According to every analysis,
this child is the offspring...

00:17.720 --> 00:20.314
of Commander Tucker
and Commander T'Pol.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.233
We think Terra Prime is involved...

00:22.360 --> 00:24.316
and it has something to do
with the child.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.271
Find it, you'll have the answers.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.197
I've never been pregnant, Trip.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.595
Then how do you explain all this?

00:30.880 --> 00:34.634
She's not here to do a story
on Enterprise, Travis. She's a spy.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.319
I'm returning Earth to its rightful owners.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.593
I have just taken over
the verteron array on Mars.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.871
I can now fire on any ship or facility
in the system.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.356
I have no intention
of using this weapon again...

00:52.480 --> 00:56.758
provided that every single non-human
in our system leaves...

00:56.880 --> 00:58.154
immediately.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.477
I know there will be questions.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.989
We've been dealing with non-humans
for almost a century....

01:04.120 --> 01:06.509
-Block that transmission.
-He's on every frequency.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.835
The signal's going system-wide.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.392
Target his ship.
Take out their communications.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.276
He's tied his warp reactor into the array.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.836
If we hit him
it'll take out half of Utopia Colony.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.714
-Open a channel to Starfleet.
-Judge the evidence for yourselves.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.398
Everything's jammed.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.830
The citizen-soldiers of Terra Prime
will act to protect you...

01:27.960 --> 01:31.919
against the most dangerous enemy
that humanity has ever faced.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.114
It's been a long road

01:41.920 --> 01:43.956
Gettin' from there to here

01:45.360 --> 01:47.191
It's been a long time

01:48.560 --> 01:51.870
But my time is finally near

01:52.520 --> 01:55.273
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:56.720 --> 01:59.075
I will touch the sky

01:59.200 --> 02:01.475
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:03.720 --> 02:06.393
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:06.520 --> 02:10.592
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:11.400 --> 02:14.119
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:14.240 --> 02:17.755
I've got faith to believe

02:18.840 --> 02:21.434
I can do anything

02:21.560 --> 02:25.269
I've got strength of the soul

02:26.160 --> 02:28.833
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:28.960 --> 02:32.589
I can reach any star

02:34.480 --> 02:36.471
I've got faith

02:38.160 --> 02:40.116
I've got faith

02:41.840 --> 02:44.832
Faith of the heart

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.840 --> 02:57.719
Do not be deceived.
This is no ordinary, innocent child.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.751
This is an alien-human hybrid.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.758
Living proof of what will happen
if we allow ourselves...

03:02.880 --> 03:04.871
to be submerged
in an interstellar coalition.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.593
Our genetic heritage....

03:07.720 --> 03:09.676
I want that transmission blocked.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.234
We're trying.
We can't break through the signal.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.272
Then find some way to contact
Enterprise. I want to speak to Archer.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.188
Terra Prime is dedicated to the
protection of life in all of its diversity.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.118
So for the next 24 hours,
we guarantee safe passage...

03:22.240 --> 03:24.390
to all aliens leaving our solar system.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.031
So long as non-humans keep
to their own worlds....

03:27.160 --> 03:29.355
Scan Paxton's ship for Vulcan bio-signs.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.119
Get a transporter lock
on the baby and T'Pol.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.918
But if any alien...

03:34.040 --> 03:37.032
if one single alien remains
after the deadline...

03:37.280 --> 03:41.717
Terra Prime will defend the sovereignty
of every single human being...

03:42.520 --> 03:45.478
and we will begin
by destroying the institution...

03:45.600 --> 03:50.116
whose blind arrogance and moral
cowardice have put us all at risk.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.992
Starfleet Command.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.838
We do not seek war...

03:55.000 --> 03:57.958
but if the aliens do not leave,
and force us to fight...

03:58.080 --> 04:01.789
I make this solemn promise to all
of the sons and daughters of Earth:

04:01.920 --> 04:03.717
Our future will be secure...

04:03.960 --> 04:07.635
because humanity will prevail.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.315
He's targeted us with the array.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.995
Apparently,
they don't like being scanned.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.678
Get us out of here.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.628
Damage?

04:21.760 --> 04:24.672
Massive power surge.
We've lost half our relays.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.360
The beam was only 2%
of the array's total output.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.708
He could have vaporized us.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.877
We'll consider ourselves warned.
Set a course to Earth.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.355
-lf you'll excuse me.
-Of course.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.879
Ambassador.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.355
Spontaneous demonstrations have
already begun...

04:45.480 --> 04:47.152
around the Vulcan compound.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.759
Isolated incidents, I'm sure.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.190
There are protestors chanting
outside the Andorian embassy.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.310
And they're using words
that aren't in the universal translator.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.716
It's obvious Paxton's ultimatum
is part of a coordinated plan.

05:00.840 --> 05:05.197
Why are we all still here?
We could be obliterated at any second.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.754
Paxton's a fanatic,
but he's a man of his word.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.677
He won't act before his deadline's up.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.314
The deadline aside,
the fact that Paxton has the support...

05:12.440 --> 05:15.432
of so many of your people
is almost as troubling.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.789
I agree.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.988
Earthmen talk about uniting worlds...

05:20.480 --> 05:22.789
but your own planet is deeply divided.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.151
Perhaps you're not quite ready
to host this conference.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.837
Paxton's holding two of my officers
hostage at the array.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.598
We can't attack it.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.551
The council's aware of that.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.477
If you can't bring yourself
to fire on them...

05:46.600 --> 05:48.352
another captain can be assigned
to Enterprise.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.995
-No one will think less of you.
-It's not just the hostages.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.071
Any attack on the array...

05:54.240 --> 05:57.437
will trigger a massive explosion
that could kill thousands of colonists.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.516
This wasn't an easy decision
for the council.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.949
The potential for disaster's even greater
than you think.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.753
Over the next 30 months,
the terraforming project...

06:04.880 --> 06:07.440
has 14 comets set to collide with Mars.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.109
Without the array to divert them
toward the polar caps...

06:11.240 --> 06:14.391
the comets could hit anywhere,
even the domed cities.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.311
I'll take in a small team. We'll break into
the facility and stop them.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.874
Paxton can destroy any ship
that approaches Mars.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.675
If he can't see us, he can't destroy us.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.076
It's unharmed, just as I said.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.075
Her medical readings appear normal.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.590
-There's nothing normal about it.
-She's not an "it."

06:48.280 --> 06:50.794
How did you obtain
our genetic material?

06:50.920 --> 06:52.911
The child is a binary clone.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.998
They'd need cells from both of us.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.318
The medical freezers on your ship
hold bio-samples from your entire crew.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.790
Terra Prime has supporters everywhere.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.036
Someone on Enterprise helped you?
Who?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.754
I've let you see your daughter.
That's my half of the bargain.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.393
Now it's your turn.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.114
I need to make modifications
on my ship.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.719
I'm listening.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.513
I need you to refine
my targeting system.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.037
You really think I'm gonna help you
turn that array into a weapon?

07:25.160 --> 07:28.038
You really think I'm going
to give you a choice?

07:46.360 --> 07:50.069
Two meetings in the span of a week.
People might start to talk.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.110
I don't like it any more than you do.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.117
So, you want to go to Mars
and you need my help.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.229
You know the situation.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.078
I believe I'm aware of the broad strokes.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.953
I also understand Paxton's tapped
into the planetary sensor grid.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.753
No one can get within 1,000 kilometers
of the verteron array...

08:04.880 --> 08:07.269
-without being detected.
-You're going to tell me how.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.994
What makes you think
I even have that information?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.873
Because your section routinely thinks
about the unthinkable.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.798
And because you'd never miss a chance
to put me in your debt.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.195
You're a good judge of character.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.591
The grid was designed to function
in the planet's original atmosphere...

08:21.720 --> 08:23.597
but terraforming's made the air
much thicker.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.517
How does that help us?

08:27.280 --> 08:29.475
Sections of the grid
continually need recalibration...

08:29.600 --> 08:31.318
and are prone to false signals.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.236
You can exploit that weakness.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.111
The good news is, with terraforming...

08:35.240 --> 08:37.707
there's no more need for pressure suits
in the lowland.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.671
Oxygen, yes. Thermal garments--

08:39.799 --> 08:43.587
According to this, if we keep our altitude
less than 10 meters above the surface...

08:43.720 --> 08:45.039
Paxton won't see us.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.196
You'll still need
to reach the surface undetected.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.471
That part's taken care of,
without your help.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.237
So, the student has surpassed
the teacher.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.238
When you're finished with Mars,
why don't you come work for me?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.590
I've got quite enough to keep me busy
on Enterprise.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.998
And if Archer's coalition is formed,
Enterprise could be busier than ever.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.309
Indeed?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.797
Well, then I imagine this will be
the last time we meet.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.318
Always the optimist.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.233
Good luck...

09:20.960 --> 09:22.154
Malcolm.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.671
Comet Burke,
deflected by the array eight years ago.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.553
Set to hit the north pole of Mars
at dawn.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.519
You're not serious.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.676
I have experience with comets, sir.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.759
Compared to penetrating Xindi
defenses, this'll be a walk in the park.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.518
But that's only 14 hours from now.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.518
What happens if this plan of yours
doesn't work?

09:52.640 --> 09:55.757
Enterprise will destroy the array
as ordered.

09:58.720 --> 10:03.157
All the rocking in the world will not
make that child Vulcan or human.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.438
Human and Vulcan genes
produced this child...

10:07.200 --> 10:11.398
which indicates our two species
have more similarities than differences.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.995
Don't you realize that baby is....

10:15.240 --> 10:18.596
That baby's as much a threat
to your species as it is to mine?

10:18.720 --> 10:22.110
-She's not a threat.
-That child is a cross-breed freak.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.595
How many generations
before our genome is so diluted...

10:24.720 --> 10:28.838
that the word "human" is nothing more
than a footnote in some medical text?

10:28.960 --> 10:32.191
The same thing could happen to your
people or don't you care about that?

10:32.320 --> 10:35.596
Neither of our species is what it was
a million years ago...

10:35.720 --> 10:38.996
nor what it will become in the future.
Life is change.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.395
Change in this case means extinction...

10:41.520 --> 10:45.718
and I for one will not let that baby
bring humanity to that point.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.713
-I won't let you hurt her.
-I won't have to.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.112
What does that mean?

11:04.120 --> 11:07.157
-We're within range.
-Bridge to Engineering.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.876
-Kelby here.
-We're coming up on the comet.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.433
I'm on it, sir.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.029
This is it, people. Cycle the ports.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.230
Ensign, rig the intakes
for cometary debris.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.554
Yes, sir.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.671
Engineering's good to go, sir.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.677
You've got full impulse
and warp standing by.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.917
All right, Travis.
Let's hitch a ride to Mars.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.753
Aye, aye, sir.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.433
-Thank you for seeing me.
-What's so urgent?

11:57.400 --> 12:00.358
-I never got my lawyer.
-You'll have to talk to the Captain.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.835
-Apparently, he's busy.
-We all are.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.794
That's it?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.756
I don't work for Terra Prime.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.795
I work for Starfleet Intelligence.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.438
That's not possible.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.914
You are not the only one
who wants to serve his people.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.156
If you were an Sl agent,
you'd be out of this brig...

12:25.280 --> 12:26.599
with one call to your division head.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.075
And everyone on Enterprise
would know who I am...

12:29.200 --> 12:31.873
including the real
Terra Prime operative.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.797
Mayweather, go ahead.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.635
We're ready for you in the Launch Bay.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.988
On my way.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.554
You know I'm going to tell
the Captain about this.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.352
He won't believe you.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.953
Probably not.
Why are you telling me this now?

12:53.080 --> 12:54.957
You're going after Paxton.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.753
If someone on Enterprise
is working for him...

12:59.120 --> 13:00.678
he could know you're coming.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.554
So you're revealing all of this
because you're worried about me.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.755
Yes.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.229
I'm touched.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.839
Travis, wait!

13:10.640 --> 13:13.200
You're not going to manipulate
me again.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.554
Goodbye.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.752
Keep the sensors locked on the array.
The moment it powers up--

13:26.880 --> 13:28.677
I won't hesitate, sir.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.792
I remember when you used to jump
every time the engines hiccupped.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.559
I still do. I'm just better at hiding it.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.469
Captain.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.949
Don't get too used to that chair.
I'm gonna want it back.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.474
Understood.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.152
You know, I never used to like Vulcans
all that much myself.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.076
They always seemed so smug...

14:02.680 --> 14:06.639
making us jump through hoops for every
little advance in warp technology...

14:06.920 --> 14:09.309
and they knew the answers all along.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.397
So what was it with you?

14:12.400 --> 14:15.676
The ears?
The fact that they're vegetarian?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.676
-They're not human.
-Well, can't deny that.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.437
And they sat by
while millions of our people died.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.634
World War lll.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.718
We didn't make contact with
the Vulcans until 10 years after the war.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.196
But they were up there.
With their superior technology.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.754
They could have stopped it
but they didn't.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.833
I think it suited their plans.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.236
A devastated Earth was much easier
for them to control.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.916
Is that the kind of paranoid crap
Paxton's been feeding you?

14:44.040 --> 14:45.598
Get back to work.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.915
You ever actually met a Vulcan?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.315
Your friend, she's the first.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.948
If you got to know some,
actually took the time to talk with one....

14:58.080 --> 15:00.674
Well, you obviously did more than talk.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.316
And look what you got for your trouble.
Some half-human thing.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.234
Go ahead.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.675
Okay.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.318
You're a traitor.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.992
A traitor to humanity.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.436
Hull plating's steady at 94%.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.191
What's wrong
with the inertial dampeners?

15:52.320 --> 15:54.709
We need to maintain
an erratic flight profile...

15:54.840 --> 15:57.308
so we look like a chunk of the comet.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.515
Thirty minutes to the atmosphere.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.476
I'm taking us closer to the nucleus.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.318
It's going to start getting a little rough.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.509
Start?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.153
Would you like me
to give you something?

16:10.280 --> 16:13.397
-I've already had the maximum dosage.
-Here's a bag.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.915
There's nothing aliens like better
than to see us fighting one another.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.270
-Where's T'Pol and the baby?
-They're together.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.436
You'll eat as soon as you finish
your work.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.959
I am finished.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.873
All you've done is try to sabotage
the targeting system.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.353
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.153
Please. I've been monitoring your work
from the control center.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.111
To be honest,
I'd have been disappointed...

16:34.240 --> 16:36.196
if you hadn't tried to sabotage the array.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.118
But you did.
Which proves you're a man of principle.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.630
That's why I know you're going to refine
the array just as you promised.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.548
I told you I'd make modifications
to your ship, not your weapon.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.713
In two hours, I am going to fire a
verteron beam...

16:49.840 --> 16:51.751
directly at Starfleet Command.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.077
Now, with this targeting system
the way it is I will hit Starfleet...

16:55.200 --> 16:58.033
but I'll also take out half
of San Francisco along with it.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.039
-I need a scalpel, not a bludgeon.
-I don't care what you need.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.877
Starfleet's been warned,
if that's what concerns you.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.357
Now, you can either help me, and a few
empty buildings will be destroyed...

17:13.599 --> 17:16.114
or you refuse me, and millions may die.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.038
You told Starfleet
when you're planning to fire the array.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.877
And you don't think
they're going to blast...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.069
this facility off the face of the planet?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.719
If you're so eager for a bloodbath,
a bloodbath is what you will get.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.429
Put him in detention.
And make sure he has a news screen.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.028
I want him to see the bodies when they
start to pull them from the rubble.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.675
Hello.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.838
I'm your mother.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.596
You're going to need a name.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.514
We should discuss that with your father.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.278
The gravity's starting
to tear the comet apart.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.876
We're picking up ionization
from the upper atmosphere.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.549
What was that?

18:46.680 --> 18:49.319
The engine shut down
but there were no warning lights.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.317
The console's locked up.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.997
Hull plating's off-line.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.198
Hull temperature's climbing.
We're coming in too hot.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.830
Bypassing auto flight control.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.716
-Switching to manual.
-At this speed?

19:21.840 --> 19:23.558
We're out of options.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.473
-Ground proximity?
-Five seconds to impact.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.280
Well, that was fun. Can we do it again?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.552
A mark 3 interlock.

21:13.960 --> 21:18.033
The closer we get, the more we risk
being spotted by Paxton's sensors.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.955
-Get close to that ridge line.
-I was thinking the same thing.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.195
You'll want to keep your arms
inside the vehicle at all times.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.954
Thirty-two.

21:46.080 --> 21:49.117
This is the 32nd planet I've set foot on.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.276
Two hundred and forty-eight.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.953
The verteron array is on the other side
of that rise.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.433
We'll head through there.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.230
I'm told you have something
to say to me.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.315
In private.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.876
I keep no secrets from my men.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.829
You and I both know that's not true.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.791
-Josiah, give us the room.
-I'll be outside.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.478
My daughter's ill.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.194
You'll arrange for medical care at once.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.438
No one leaves this facility.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.358
You will provide immediate transport
for my child...

22:35.480 --> 22:37.232
Commander Tucker, and myself.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.558
The hospital at Utopia Colony
will be suitable until Enterprise arrives.

22:43.520 --> 22:46.273
What, have you been inhaling
the atmosphere?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.358
What makes you think
you can dictate terms to me?

22:49.480 --> 22:50.515
This.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.998
Taggart's Syndrome.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.599
Since you obviously didn't die
by age 20, you're receiving treatment.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.313
-Rigellian gene therapy?
-You're not a doctor.

23:03.440 --> 23:07.479
The very thing you're warning humans
to avoid is what's keeping you alive.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.875
Alien knowledge, freely shared.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.510
You're not only a terrorist,
you're a hypocrite.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.870
This is not the time for timidity
and second guessing.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.672
We cannot afford to doubt ourselves.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.031
Colonel Green also said,
"To be human is to be pure."

23:20.160 --> 23:21.991
Under his rule,
you would have been euthanized...

23:22.120 --> 23:23.599
for having a genetic disorder.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.395
I'm not the first significant leader who
failed to measure up to his own ideals.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.796
-You're not significant.
-History will determine that!

23:31.360 --> 23:33.555
So go ahead,
tell my followers what you wish.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.592
See if they take the word of an alien
over mine.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.830
What's wrong with your child?

23:40.960 --> 23:43.952
Elevated white blood cell count,
low-grade fever.

23:44.120 --> 23:47.590
Well, its two halves are warring
with one another.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.713
Alien and human.
Conflict was inevitable.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.189
Josiah.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.399
Your child
and the Coalition of Planets...

24:02.680 --> 24:04.830
both doomed from the beginning.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.999
Ten meters.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.717
Paxton's deadline is up.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.076
We have to face an unpleasant reality.
Captain Archer's mission has failed.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.317
Paxton will need two minutes
to power up the array before he can fire.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.634
-Two minutes?
-It's enough.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.196
I'm not prepared to take that chance.
Your estimates could be wrong.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.959
I won't destroy the array
unless we have no other choice.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.435
-I understand your reluctance.
-I'm following orders.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.074
I'm giving you new orders. Do it now.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.954
Sorry, sir.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.275
I can have you relieved of duty.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.592
Actually, I can only be relieved
by a higher-ranking officer...

24:56.720 --> 24:58.039
in my chain of command.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.072
-Open a channel to Admiral Gardner.
-Belay that order.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.476
I won't risk exposing our position
by breaking radio silence.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.233
You're risking the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.397
I know what I'm doing.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.157
The guard's still walking away.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.838
There's another guard approaching.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.632
-Took you long enough.
-Where's T'Pol?

25:41.760 --> 25:44.274
Crew quarters. But Paxton's
getting ready to fire the array.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.355
If he powers it up--

25:45.480 --> 25:48.153
Enterprise has orders
to destroy the complex.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.039
I've spoken to our operatives.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.469
There's no indication that the Vulcans
have withdrawn...

25:55.600 --> 25:58.319
from their consulates
in Canberra or Berlin.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.790
I never expected them to comply.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.632
Let's get this done.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.518
I'm picking up a power surge
in the array.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.595
You're out of time.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.631
Destroy the complex now.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.711
Take us in, full impulse.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.753
Charge weapons.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.149
Josiah, begin the firing sequence.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.079
Target locked.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.353
Give the order.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.637
Coordinates locked in.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.390
Two minutes to pulse activation.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.392
Step away from the controls.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.794
Jonathan Archer.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.676
The man who delivered us
from the Xindi. Well, look at you now.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.075
-Archer to Enterprise.
-Go ahead, Captain.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.428
We're inside the control room.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.279
Standing by.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.869
Shut it down.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.991
Main controls are in there.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.909
Ninety seconds to pulse activation.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.357
The room's depressurizing,
get Malcolm out of here.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.115
Go!

27:40.800 --> 27:43.598
Plasma grid, control panel.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.950
I know the reason
you've turned your back on humanity.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.278
I blame your father.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.755
He wanted the secrets
of warp technology so badly...

27:55.880 --> 27:59.077
he allowed the Vulcans
to turn him into their pet human.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.153
And you, well...

28:01.600 --> 28:03.431
the sins of the father....

28:04.240 --> 28:07.596
Plasma grid off-line.
Firing sequence aborted.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.153
My father never asked anything
from anyone.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.078
His mining operations
transformed the moon...

28:17.880 --> 28:21.270
from a mere colony
into a completely self-sufficient world...

28:21.400 --> 28:24.198
and that is how
we should go to the stars.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.873
Taking the worlds we need
and taming them...

28:28.400 --> 28:32.439
with human hands, and human minds,
and human souls.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.675
That might have worked for the moon...

28:36.320 --> 28:38.629
but the galaxy's a lot more crowded
than we thought.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.638
-That's not our problem.
-It's an opportunity.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.678
It's over, Paxton.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.756
We're each his father's child.

28:52.520 --> 28:56.149
I've been a miner all my life.
You get used to the low oxygen.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.637
Firing sequence resumed.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.550
Pulse activation in 30 seconds.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.394
Pulse activation in 15 seconds.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.190
Ten, nine, eight....

29:21.320 --> 29:24.437
I've locked the sequence.
You can't stop it from firing.

29:25.160 --> 29:29.358
-I've locked it!
-Five, four, three, two, one....

29:32.280 --> 29:33.793
Pulse activated.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.353
Terra Prime, forever.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.875
Looks like Paxton's aim was off.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.988
With a little help from you.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.039
Maybe a little.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.954
Commander.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.113
She's dying.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.750
Captain's Starlog, January 22,2155...

30:15.760 --> 30:17.876
Enterprise is returning to Earth.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.356
Paxton is in custody,
but the consequences of his actions...

30:21.480 --> 30:23.357
continue to affect us all.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.716
I guess we shouldn't
keep calling her "she."

30:32.880 --> 30:34.108
Elizabeth.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.031
My sister would have liked that.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.078
It appears my initial prognosis
was incorrect.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.359
It's genetic.

30:56.400 --> 31:00.029
Her Vulcan and human DNA
aren't compatible.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.676
Is there anything you can do?

31:07.840 --> 31:09.956
I'm attempting to stabilize
her nucleotides...

31:10.080 --> 31:12.196
but there's never been a child like her.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.032
Her name is Elizabeth.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.356
I can't figure out
why the console locked up...

31:20.480 --> 31:22.755
at the same time the engine shut down.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.230
It does seem a bit coincidental.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.870
Flight control and engine power
are routed separately...

31:32.440 --> 31:34.112
until they reach...

31:37.280 --> 31:39.714
that junction. The panel's open.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.959
If ionized gas got in here...

31:42.080 --> 31:44.674
it could have melted
the primary circuits of both systems.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.916
It could have been knocked loose
by an impact.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.917
No. It's been forced.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.718
This was deliberate.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.269
Come in.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.352
On your feet, sir.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.033
Shuttlepod One was sabotaged.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.350
-Sabotaged?
-We nearly crashed!

32:03.480 --> 32:06.438
-ls this your signature?
-Yeah.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.909
-You think I had something to do with it?
-ls there any reason why we shouldn't?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.598
That's a Shuttlepod maintenance log.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.472
Commander Tucker took me
off that team...

32:14.600 --> 32:16.079
when he came back from Columbia.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.792
Who replaced you?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.358
-Who?
-Ensign Masaro.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.710
They really want to postpone
the conference?

32:27.840 --> 32:30.832
"Postpone" is a diplomatic way
of saying it's dead.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.279
Paxton's unnerved them...

32:32.400 --> 32:35.517
and there's not a lot I've been
able to say to change their minds.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.073
Excuse me, sir.

32:38.080 --> 32:42.153
-Sato, go ahead.
-It's Archer, are you still with Samuels?

32:42.680 --> 32:45.717
-We're in the Mess Hall.
-ls Ensign Masaro there?

32:49.240 --> 32:50.639
I don't see him, sir.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.955
We think Masaro may be working
for Terra Prime.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.992
Samuels may be in danger.
Reed and Mayweather are on their way.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.239
Wait here, sir.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.836
Samuels is in here. He's safe.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.194
Captain.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.554
-You don't want to do this.
-I have to.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.231
Give me the phase-pistol.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.070
-That's an order.
-I can't, sir.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.755
-Ensign.
-I wanted you to know...

33:28.720 --> 33:29.948
I'm sorry.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.270
I believed in what we were doing.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.989
Tell my parents I'm sorry.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.275
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.669
Ensign.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.237
I wish I could do more.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.035
I know.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.878
When you invited me to join this crew...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.797
I thought it would be
an interesting diversion...

34:09.920 --> 34:11.478
for a few months.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.757
Some time away from the complications
of family.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.232
Which on Denobula
can be extremely complicated.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.920
I didn't expect to gain another family.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.353
It hurts as if she were my own child.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.550
Make something good
come from this, Captain.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.549
Fellow delegates, this last week...

34:58.200 --> 35:01.431
we've seen what humans can be
at their worst.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.316
But we cannot, we must not...

35:04.760 --> 35:08.196
use that as an excuse
to end the dream that began here.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.470
For then, the demons of our past
will have won.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.119
Instead, I want to look to the future...

35:17.640 --> 35:21.838
and begin by honoring the people
responsible for our being here tonight.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.956
They represent all of us at our best.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.230
Up until about 100 years ago...

35:36.560 --> 35:39.711
there was one question
that burned in every human...

35:40.160 --> 35:43.709
that made us study the stars
and dream of traveling to them.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.753
Are we alone?

35:48.520 --> 35:51.239
Our generation is privileged...

35:52.800 --> 35:55.234
to know the answer to that question.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.071
We are all explorers...

35:59.440 --> 36:02.193
driven to know what's over the horizon...

36:03.440 --> 36:05.635
what's beyond our own shores.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.235
And yet...

36:13.200 --> 36:14.838
the more I've experienced...

36:16.840 --> 36:18.592
the more I've learned...

36:20.120 --> 36:22.111
that no matter how far we travel...

36:23.640 --> 36:25.631
or how fast we get there...

36:27.880 --> 36:30.110
the most profound discoveries...

36:31.040 --> 36:34.874
are not necessarily
beyond that next star.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.153
They're within us...

36:41.280 --> 36:43.919
woven into the threads that bind us.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.159
All of us...

36:48.440 --> 36:49.873
to each other.

36:52.560 --> 36:56.678
The final frontier begins in this hall.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.996
Let's explore it together.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.071
I hear the conference is back on track.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.315
It's a first step.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.830
The Captain says it's going to take
years to work out the details.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.918
But it'll happen,
and you're part of the reason why.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.553
Just doing my job.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.829
So was l.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.155
I know.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.232
If Vulcans and Andorians can get along,
you'd think we could.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.436
A lot of details to work out.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.316
Isn't that the fast way home?

38:04.800 --> 38:07.314
The least I can do is give you a ride.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.279
The Launch Bay's this way.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.314
Come in.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.314
The delegates at the conference...

38:41.920 --> 38:43.911
they've asked about the service...

38:48.520 --> 38:49.953
for Elizabeth.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.078
They want to attend.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.272
She was important.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.597
There's something else.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.438
I spoke with Phlox.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.396
It turns out there was a flaw
in the technique...

39:12.760 --> 39:15.877
that Paxton's doctors used
in the cloning process.

39:20.080 --> 39:23.038
Human DNA and Vulcan DNA...

39:25.040 --> 39:28.828
Phlox says there's no medical reason
why they can't combine.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.869
So if a Vulcan and a human...

39:38.640 --> 39:40.835
ever decided to have a child...

39:45.120 --> 39:46.917
it'd probably be okay.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.991
And that's sort of comforting.
