Hi, there.

00:39.590 --> 00:41.590
Hi. I'm Cindy.

00:41.592 --> 00:43.326
The only way I
believe I'm pretty

00:43.328 --> 00:45.061
is if strangers
have sex with me.

00:45.063 --> 00:47.797
Well, maybe I could help fill
you up with self-confidence.

00:47.799 --> 00:48.898
Brian.

00:48.900 --> 00:49.932
Hello there, sexy.

00:49.934 --> 00:50.933
Hey, do you mind?

00:50.935 --> 00:52.268
We were having
a conversation.

00:52.270 --> 00:55.972
My house has 8,000 square feet,
zero bookshelves.

00:55.974 --> 00:58.240
Wow, that's impressive.

00:58.242 --> 01:00.142
I'm a writer,
published twice.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.078
I own a cinder block yard.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.146
Have over 12,000
cinder blocks.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.916
If you ever need cinder block,
I can get you good price.

01:06.918 --> 01:08.084
Thank you.

01:08.086 --> 01:11.020
I-I have a six-CD changer,
so you can pretty much

01:11.022 --> 01:13.189
fill the tray
and create a world.

01:13.191 --> 01:14.623
Come have sex with me.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.493
My mother will make you
farkshekoosh when we are done.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.929
Okay.

01:19.931 --> 01:21.197
Wait!

01:21.199 --> 01:23.632
I have a time machine.

01:23.634 --> 01:25.134
You do?

01:25.136 --> 01:26.168
Yeah, you want to see it?

01:26.170 --> 01:28.604
Yes, I want to see it!

01:28.606 --> 01:29.972
Better luck next time, pal.

01:29.974 --> 01:31.807
Some people got moves,
others don't.

01:31.809 --> 01:33.009
Been that way forever.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.010
You.

01:34.012 --> 01:36.145
Me. Sex.

01:36.147 --> 01:37.913
Him legend.

01:42.819 --> 01:45.054
Shh.

01:45.056 --> 01:48.524
Why do you keep a sleeping baby
in your time machine room?

01:48.526 --> 01:51.093
I-I don't know,
my decorator's terrible.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.897
(whooshing)

02:05.542 --> 02:06.876
Where are we?

02:06.878 --> 02:10.079
Ford's Theater,
April 14, 1865.

02:10.081 --> 02:12.014
Ooh, Valentine's Day.

02:12.016 --> 02:13.349
How romantic.

02:13.351 --> 02:16.352
Uh, yeah, sure,
you know me.

02:16.354 --> 02:17.586
(moaning)

02:17.588 --> 02:19.055
(gunshot)

02:19.057 --> 02:20.222
(all gasping)

02:20.224 --> 02:22.691
Oh, my God,
the president's been shot!

02:22.693 --> 02:25.161
If you ask me, the
president's the lucky one.
How's that?

02:25.163 --> 02:27.863
He doesn't have to sit
through the rest of the show.

02:27.865 --> 02:28.998
(both laughing)

02:29.000 --> 02:30.433
(gunshot)

02:33.003 --> 02:35.071
(door creaks)

02:37.174 --> 02:38.941
(murmuring)

02:38.943 --> 02:41.077
Yes, I'd like
to return this printer.

02:43.213 --> 02:45.748
(whooshing)

02:45.750 --> 02:47.917
HERBERT MORRISON:
<i>The frame is crashing</i>
<i>to the ground,</i>

02:47.919 --> 02:49.952
<i>not quite to the mooring mast!</i>
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

02:49.954 --> 02:51.754
<i>And all the passengers</i>
<i>screaming around here!</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:54.023
<i>And just when you thought</i>
<i>it couldn't get any worse,</i>

02:54.025 --> 02:56.292
<i>there's a dog having sex</i>
<i>with a woman!</i>

02:56.294 --> 02:58.861
<i>Oh, I know I said,</i>
<i>"Oh, the humanity!" before,</i>

02:58.863 --> 03:01.197
but seriously, oh, the humanity
<i>even more right now!</i>

03:01.199 --> 03:03.132
<i>I mean, come on!</i>

03:08.105 --> 03:11.073
So that's what restaurants
were like before desegregation.

03:11.075 --> 03:13.442
It was quiet.
It <i>was</i> quiet.

03:17.147 --> 03:19.081
Wow, Brian,
you've had quite a string

03:19.083 --> 03:21.150
of female guests
spend the night lately.

03:21.152 --> 03:23.052
Yeah, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

03:23.054 --> 03:25.187
You should see the way
<i>I</i> have to pick up chicks.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.289
Hi.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.458
(giggling)

03:32.729 --> 03:33.963
(whooshing)

03:33.965 --> 03:36.732
Well, I guess you can call
me the Man of La Muncha.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.100
(laughs)

03:38.102 --> 03:40.236
Hey, why does your
time machine have a sticker

03:40.238 --> 03:42.138
that says
"property of Stewie Griffin?"

03:42.140 --> 03:44.773
Uh, well, I-I...

03:44.775 --> 03:46.242
(sighs)

03:46.244 --> 03:47.843
All right, to be
completely honest,

03:47.845 --> 03:49.979
and because we've already
had sex, it's not mine.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.781
I use it all the time,
and the owner has no idea.

03:52.783 --> 03:54.316
In fact, he'd
kill me if he knew.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.519
Really? Won't he see that thing
on the control panel

03:56.521 --> 03:57.920
that says "years traveled"?

03:57.922 --> 03:59.355
What thing?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.527
Here's where Brian goes berserk.

04:04.529 --> 04:06.595
(yelling)

04:09.266 --> 04:11.901
(yelling continues)

04:16.006 --> 04:19.208
(yelling winds down)

04:19.210 --> 04:21.143
Look, it's no big deal.

04:21.145 --> 04:23.045
Just reverse it
and take off the miles.

04:23.047 --> 04:25.614
That's what I do
when I take my dad's car out.

04:25.616 --> 04:27.683
Are you... are you 16?

04:27.685 --> 04:29.351
I will be next September.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.886
Well, I think someone

04:30.888 --> 04:34.190
has a Barnes & Noble gift card
coming for their silence.

04:40.063 --> 04:41.897
(groaning)

04:41.899 --> 04:43.265
(grunts, glass breaks)

04:47.871 --> 04:49.872
(electrical hissing)

04:52.042 --> 04:53.742
(high-pitched chirping)

04:53.744 --> 04:55.311
(electrical hissing)

04:57.480 --> 04:59.815
Brian, what the hell
are you doing in here?

04:59.817 --> 05:01.183
What's happening
to my time machine?

05:01.185 --> 05:02.418
I-I don't know, man.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.320
I-I saw Meg leaving
a minute ago,

05:04.322 --> 05:05.688
going, "Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"
but I-I don't know.

05:05.690 --> 05:08.924
(loud, droning whirring)

05:11.194 --> 05:12.261
(whooshing,
electrical hissing)

05:12.263 --> 05:14.330
(explosive pop, whirring)

05:20.337 --> 05:22.638
Oh, my God, it's having
a complete meltdown!

05:24.274 --> 05:26.709
(electrical hissing, beeps)

05:26.711 --> 05:28.010
(loud whooshing)

05:28.012 --> 05:30.446
(yelling)

05:41.057 --> 05:42.391
What happened?

05:42.393 --> 05:43.926
I don't know.

05:43.928 --> 05:46.195
(steam hissing)

05:46.197 --> 05:48.964
Dear God, my
time machine!

05:50.767 --> 05:53.369
You, uh... you want
to tell me about this?

05:53.371 --> 05:55.371
See? I told you.
It was Meg.

05:55.373 --> 05:56.405
I don't think so.

05:56.407 --> 05:58.374
The crotch doesn't
look like a BMX track.

05:58.376 --> 06:00.409
You bastard! You've been
using my time machine

06:00.411 --> 06:01.710
to nail your
bar skanks!

06:01.712 --> 06:03.412
Oh, come on,
they're not all bad.

06:03.414 --> 06:05.648
Oh, yes, I've seen the
women you bring home.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.783
That stutterer?
She was a real prize.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.652
How are you enjoying
your meal?

06:09.654 --> 06:13.489
L-L-Lois, it's
d-d-d-delicious.

06:13.491 --> 06:15.391
Oh, for crying out loud.

06:15.393 --> 06:17.459
Peter, why are you turning up
the heat again?

06:17.461 --> 06:20.129
Lois, this woman
is obviously freezing.

06:20.131 --> 06:21.664
Brian, I want
you to tell me

06:21.666 --> 06:23.432
exactly what you did
to my time machine.

06:23.434 --> 06:26.268
Well, I didn't want you
to find out I'd been using it,

06:26.270 --> 06:29.405
so I tried turning the
chronological gauge backward.

06:29.407 --> 06:31.173
It's not designed to
go backward, Brian.

06:31.175 --> 06:34.009
The question is, how
am I going to fix it?

06:34.011 --> 06:36.345
What the hell?

06:46.656 --> 06:50.092
Dear God,
everything's moving backward.

06:50.094 --> 06:51.360
What? What are
you talking about?

06:51.362 --> 06:53.262
I don't know
what the hell you did

06:53.264 --> 06:54.830
with all your
messing around, Brian,

06:54.832 --> 06:56.131
but somehow my machine seems

06:56.133 --> 06:57.800
to have reversed
the direction of time.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.301
Reversed the
direction of time?

06:59.303 --> 07:01.003
Stewie, what does
that even mean?

07:01.005 --> 07:02.438
I don't get it.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.344
Okay, now I get it.

07:19.456 --> 07:22.157
Stewie, you can't just change
the direction of time.

07:22.159 --> 07:23.392
H-How is this even possible?

07:23.394 --> 07:24.793
Well, clearly,
when you attempted

07:24.795 --> 07:26.662
to reverse the gauge
on my time machine,

07:26.664 --> 07:28.964
you somehow released a quantum
shock wave powerful enough

07:28.966 --> 07:31.233
to push the flow of time
in the opposite direction.

07:31.235 --> 07:34.636
I can only surmise that you and
I were isolated from its effects

07:34.638 --> 07:36.305
because we were inside
the machine

07:36.307 --> 07:37.706
at the moment
of temporal inversion.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.675
Are you...
are you sleeping?

07:39.677 --> 07:41.810
Huh? No, no, I...
No, I was listening.

07:41.812 --> 07:44.480
What kind of jerk alters time,
and then falls asleep?

07:44.482 --> 07:47.683
Look, I'm sorry, Stewie,
but do you think you can fix it?

07:47.685 --> 07:50.152
Well, it's gonna take a while
to rebuild the machine,

07:50.154 --> 07:52.388
and even longer to
recalibrate it for normal time,

07:52.390 --> 07:54.356
but I've taken on
bigger challenges before.

07:54.358 --> 07:57.926
I had to explain to America why
Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.

07:57.928 --> 08:00.295
Face.

08:01.598 --> 08:04.333
There, now you've got
a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

08:04.335 --> 08:05.868
What are you talking about?

08:05.870 --> 08:07.436
What's going on?

08:07.438 --> 08:10.572
I think you're getting
a diaper change.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.108
Aah! Get that poop-filled thing
away from me!

08:13.110 --> 08:16.211
No! Oh, God,
it's cold!

08:16.213 --> 08:19.515
Whew! Smells like somebody
needs a diaper change.

08:19.517 --> 08:20.549
Damn right I do!

08:20.551 --> 08:22.251
Now, get this turd-filled
sack off...

08:22.253 --> 08:24.753
Oh, my God,
it just went back in my body.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.956
Hey, look, what's
wrong with Peter?

08:27.958 --> 08:30.292
(snoring)

08:30.294 --> 08:32.861
Oh, you smell that?
He's passed out drunk.

08:32.863 --> 08:35.264
Does no one in this house
have any dignity?

08:35.266 --> 08:36.732
(whooshing)

08:36.734 --> 08:39.501
Hey, Lois, I'm home from
the Clam, and I'm horny.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.514
(tires squealing)

08:54.651 --> 08:57.553
(tires squealing)

08:57.555 --> 09:00.255
Hmm. Seems like reverse
time did that kid a favor.

09:00.257 --> 09:02.124
I'm not so sure about that.

09:03.426 --> 09:06.361
Stand up! You're gonna
break that thermometer!

09:12.836 --> 09:14.903
My God, it's...
it's extraordinary.

09:14.905 --> 09:16.405
They all seem to be

09:16.407 --> 09:19.107
completely unaware
that anything is amiss.

09:19.109 --> 09:21.176
(squeaking)

09:24.981 --> 09:27.182
(squeaking)

09:30.086 --> 09:32.521
"Your trash barrels
were a little close

09:32.523 --> 09:34.756
"to our driveway. Joe.

09:34.758 --> 09:36.592
"P.S. Please close
the windows

09:36.594 --> 09:38.594
"when you're giving
piano lessons.

09:38.596 --> 09:41.563
My legs don't work,
but my ears do."

09:43.166 --> 09:46.301
Brian, what are you doing
staring in Quagmire's window?

09:46.303 --> 09:49.171
Man, watching sex
in reverse is just bizarre.

10:00.383 --> 10:02.518
God, where does Quagmire
meet these women?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.186
(moaning)

10:07.390 --> 10:09.491
This is why Boxbuster
went out of business.

10:09.493 --> 10:11.426
Hey, what's going on
over there?

10:14.964 --> 10:16.698
(both gasp)

10:21.838 --> 10:23.739
My God, look at all
this devastation!

10:23.741 --> 10:24.840
What the hell happened?

10:24.842 --> 10:26.141
(whoosh, chicken clucks)

10:26.143 --> 10:29.411
(grunting)

10:29.413 --> 10:30.979
(clucks)
(grunts)

10:30.981 --> 10:33.649
(yelling)

10:33.651 --> 10:34.716
(grunts)

10:34.718 --> 10:37.719
(grunting)

10:37.721 --> 10:41.557
(groans)

10:41.559 --> 10:45.527
(slow-motion groaning)

10:45.529 --> 10:47.629
(grunting)

10:52.168 --> 10:54.836
(high-pitched whirring)

10:54.838 --> 10:56.939
(airplane engine whirring)

11:00.510 --> 11:05.080
(tires squealing, thudding)

11:05.082 --> 11:09.117
(grunting)

11:09.119 --> 11:11.186
(screaming)

11:17.360 --> 11:19.227
Okay, Seamus, today's the day

11:19.229 --> 11:21.096
you finally ask out
that barista.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.031
What's the worst
that could happen?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.618
You know, that chicken's kid
is in my preschool class.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.720
I don't really want
to be friends with him,

11:44.722 --> 11:45.988
but he knows a lot of chicks.

11:45.990 --> 11:47.723
And backwards rim shot.

11:47.725 --> 11:49.658
(backwards rim shot)

11:51.794 --> 11:54.830
Oh, Brian, this is gonna be
more difficult than I thought.

11:54.832 --> 11:56.898
Damn it, I hate
these new stairs!

11:56.900 --> 11:58.834
(screaming)

11:58.836 --> 12:01.570
(bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep)

12:01.572 --> 12:02.804
(thumping, bleep)

12:02.806 --> 12:04.740
What are you watching?

12:04.742 --> 12:06.308
<i>Meet the Press;</i>
<i>it's really weird.</i>

12:06.310 --> 12:09.111
In reverse time, the Republicans
make outrageous statements

12:09.113 --> 12:11.813
and then the host asks
an unrelated question.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.582
Global warming is a myth.

12:13.584 --> 12:16.818
God created everything, and
the world is getting colder!

12:16.820 --> 12:19.588
What is your tax plan?

12:19.590 --> 12:20.789
That's odd.

12:20.791 --> 12:21.690
What?

12:22.959 --> 12:26.928
Man, we got a large number
of clovers on our lawn.

12:26.930 --> 12:30.666
No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:30.668 --> 12:32.734
Oh, hey, Cleveland.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.507
Australia, here I come.

12:38.509 --> 12:39.641
Look at that, Brian.

12:39.643 --> 12:41.677
Cleveland is back living
across the street.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.679
Cleveland left Quahog
quite some time ago,

12:43.681 --> 12:46.181
yet we only just recently
entered reverse time.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.716
So what does that mean?

12:47.718 --> 12:50.719
Well, it suggests that time may
not simply be flowing backwards;

12:50.721 --> 12:52.654
it may, in fact,
be accelerating.

12:52.656 --> 12:54.456
Accelerating?
Why would that be happening?

12:54.458 --> 12:55.624
I'm not sure.

12:55.626 --> 12:56.658
Have you ever heard
of a phenomenon

12:56.660 --> 12:58.360
called time dilation, Brian?

12:58.362 --> 12:59.461
Sure.
No, you haven't.

12:59.463 --> 13:01.296
Time dilation,
in forward time,

13:01.298 --> 13:03.131
is a phenomenon caused
by a variety of factors

13:03.133 --> 13:05.467
in which time
moves more slowly.

13:05.469 --> 13:07.402
In reverse time,
it stands to reason

13:07.404 --> 13:09.638
that the same phenomenon would
cause time to accelerate.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.707
I'll have to consult
my quantum calculations

13:11.709 --> 13:14.409
to try to isolate the
factors responsible.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.648
What the hell was that?

13:19.650 --> 13:21.717
This is more intense
than when I fought a rabbit

13:21.719 --> 13:23.051
in that karate tournament.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.820
That's weird. You're doing
reverse cutaways now?

13:24.822 --> 13:26.988
What the hell is... (screams)
What? What's the matter?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.361
Dear God, I'm un-teething.

13:33.363 --> 13:35.664
Brian, it appears the
flow of reverse time

13:35.666 --> 13:37.232
is beginning to
affect us as well.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.700
What does that mean?

13:38.702 --> 13:41.169
It means I'm going to have
to relive everything.

13:41.171 --> 13:43.238
Every painful,
awkward moment.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.340
Like that time I forgot
what came after "G"

13:45.342 --> 13:46.742
and had to fake it.

13:46.744 --> 13:50.178
♪ A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

13:50.180 --> 13:53.782

14:09.299 --> 14:11.566
(crying, groaning)

14:11.568 --> 14:12.701
What the devil is that?

14:12.703 --> 14:13.902
It's Peter and Chris.

14:13.904 --> 14:15.570
Sounds like they're
in trouble.

14:15.572 --> 14:19.074
(groaning)

14:19.076 --> 14:21.243
My God, why is there
vomit everywhere?

14:21.245 --> 14:22.711
Is that the Ipecac bottle?

14:22.713 --> 14:23.979
Oh, no.

14:23.981 --> 14:25.247
No, please, not this.

14:25.249 --> 14:27.315
Oh, God, it's not gonna be
coming out of us;

14:27.317 --> 14:28.784
it's gonna be going...
(vomit noise)

14:28.786 --> 14:30.952
Oh, dear God...

14:30.954 --> 14:32.621
(groaning)

14:32.623 --> 14:34.689
Aah! What the hell?

14:35.892 --> 14:38.760
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!

14:38.762 --> 14:40.862
Dad, I'm scared.

14:41.831 --> 14:44.332
(crying)

14:44.334 --> 14:45.967
Oh, God, this is so disgusting.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.670
I think I'm gonna puke.

14:48.672 --> 14:50.338
(bleep)

14:50.340 --> 14:52.474
(coughing)

14:55.144 --> 14:57.245
Stewie, I don't care
what it takes.

14:57.247 --> 14:59.347
We have got to fix this.

14:59.349 --> 15:01.983
We just ate so much vomit.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.286
Brian, it gets worse.

15:04.288 --> 15:06.054
Look.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.458
Yeah, Bonnie's pregnant
with Susie. So?

15:10.460 --> 15:12.794
That means Susie's
been un-born.

15:12.796 --> 15:14.329
Oh, my God.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.264
Stewie, you're not
that much older than Susie.

15:16.266 --> 15:18.200
Brian, if we don't find a way

15:18.202 --> 15:19.835
to push time forward again soon,

15:19.837 --> 15:23.371
I, too, shall be un-born.

15:28.277 --> 15:30.679
♪ You've got

15:30.681 --> 15:36.451
♪ The AIDS.

15:36.453 --> 15:38.453
That guy's gonna feel
so much better

15:38.455 --> 15:40.555
after we do what we got planned.

15:45.962 --> 15:48.563
How much time do we have
before you're un-born?

15:48.565 --> 15:50.999
With the time acceleration,
I'm not quite sure.

15:51.001 --> 15:53.235
But trust me, I can feel
myself getting younger.

15:53.237 --> 15:55.070
All right.

15:55.072 --> 15:56.204
The machine has
been repaired.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.340
Now all I've got to do
is isolate the cause

15:58.342 --> 15:59.474
of the acceleration curve

15:59.476 --> 16:01.643
and see if I can
duplicate the shock wave.

16:01.645 --> 16:02.878
(screams)

16:02.880 --> 16:04.145
What's the matter?

16:04.147 --> 16:06.648
I've regressed to my
pre-ambulatory stage.

16:06.650 --> 16:08.250
I can no longer walk!

16:08.252 --> 16:10.652
(grunting)

16:10.654 --> 16:13.054
My God, Stewie,
you look terrible.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.756
Brian, I suddenly feel as if

16:14.758 --> 16:17.893
I've just been through
some sort of major trauma.

16:17.895 --> 16:21.029
Uh-oh. I think I know
what that major trauma was.

16:21.031 --> 16:22.998
(gasps)
My birth.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.799
Dear God, I've got
to get out of here!

16:26.102 --> 16:27.836
(gasps)

16:31.007 --> 16:32.574
Oh, he's so cute.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.609
Oh, my God, we're getting
closer to the beginning.

16:34.611 --> 16:36.211
You're Lacey Chabert.

16:36.213 --> 16:37.879
Oh, boy, a baby.

16:37.881 --> 16:40.715
I saw my Spanish teacher
leave one of you in a trash can.

16:40.717 --> 16:42.083
Brian, help!

16:42.085 --> 16:43.785
Stewie, what do I do?

16:43.787 --> 16:46.054
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

16:46.056 --> 16:48.123
I want to be the baby!

16:48.125 --> 16:49.758
Look at that head.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.393
Well, Lois,
this kind of completes

16:51.395 --> 16:53.361
your little carnival here.

16:53.363 --> 16:54.529
Hey, little guy.

16:54.531 --> 16:56.398
You ever need white,
corner-of-the-mouth stuff,

16:56.400 --> 16:58.566
you come to your grandpa.

16:58.568 --> 17:01.870
Stewie, this is
your new home.

17:01.872 --> 17:03.238
Brian, help!
It's up to you.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.974
You've got to restore
the flow of time.

17:05.976 --> 17:08.443
My life depends on it!

17:09.712 --> 17:11.980
What? Stewie, I don't know
how to fix that machine.

17:11.982 --> 17:13.214
Trust me, you can do it.

17:13.216 --> 17:15.317
You're so talented
in so many ways.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.318
Like what?

17:16.320 --> 17:17.953
Like... You...

17:17.955 --> 17:19.587
Just write down however
you think you're talented,

17:19.589 --> 17:21.323
and I'll sign it.

17:23.426 --> 17:24.960
Well, it's up to you, buddy.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.195
Save this marriage.

17:32.735 --> 17:35.804
Oh, my God,
it's the greased-up deaf guy

17:35.806 --> 17:38.306
running backwards toward
that grease truck explosion.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.475
Oh, the grease burns so bad!

17:40.477 --> 17:42.177
I can't hear!

17:44.013 --> 17:46.147
(in deeper voice):
Boy, I am late for that meeting.

17:49.952 --> 17:52.754
Come on, math, you dick.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.360
Come on, Brian.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.300
(machine whirring)

18:05.302 --> 18:06.368
All right, think, think.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.203
What do I do? What do I do?

18:08.205 --> 18:10.472
All right, could it be
as simple as this?

18:10.474 --> 18:12.040
"Invert time flow."

18:12.875 --> 18:14.609
Ah-ah-ah.

18:14.611 --> 18:15.810
Ah-ah-ah.

18:15.812 --> 18:17.278
Ah-ah-ah.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.849
Oh, he's perfect.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.818
Time of birth: 11:34 a.m.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.353
Come on, Brian, hurry.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.988
(cheering)

18:26.990 --> 18:28.323
It's a girl!

18:28.325 --> 18:30.358
With a penis and no vagina.

18:32.128 --> 18:35.830
No...!

18:35.832 --> 18:37.298
I think I can hear the ocean.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.134
Smell it, too.

18:39.136 --> 18:40.335
All right, what do I do?

18:40.337 --> 18:42.670
Wait a minute,
what did I do before?

18:42.672 --> 18:44.305
That's all I have to do, right,

18:44.307 --> 18:47.175
is duplicate the circumstances,
but do it the opposite way.

18:47.177 --> 18:48.910
All right,
I was standing right here,

18:48.912 --> 18:52.213
the machine was on,
I broke the glass...

18:52.215 --> 18:54.215
and I turned the gauge backward.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.885
Maybe if I turn it
in the other direction.

18:58.687 --> 19:01.256
(electrical buzzing)

19:21.343 --> 19:23.278
Ooh, a quarter.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.780
Who cares what that doctor found
on my nuts?

19:25.782 --> 19:27.849
This is a good day.

19:27.851 --> 19:29.050
It worked.

19:29.052 --> 19:30.819
I don't believe it. It worked.

19:35.624 --> 19:37.258
Brian, there you are.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.293
Where have you been?

19:38.295 --> 19:39.727
Meg, where's Stewie?

19:39.729 --> 19:41.396
Stewie? Who's Stewie?

19:41.398 --> 19:42.931
Here it comes.
Push, Mrs. Griffin.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.099
(groaning)

19:44.101 --> 19:45.700
You know what?

19:45.702 --> 19:48.436
I take it back, those panties
are gonna be in the way.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.138
Okay, here comes the baby.

19:50.140 --> 19:51.606
(groaning)

19:51.608 --> 19:53.408
Bloody hell!

19:53.410 --> 19:54.576
It's a boy.

19:54.578 --> 19:56.878
(cheering)
Oh, thank God.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.247
Oh, he's so beautiful.

19:59.249 --> 20:01.382
Mrs. Griffin, your husband's
standing right here.

20:01.384 --> 20:03.785
What should we name him?

20:03.787 --> 20:06.588
I kind of like
Brian's name: Stewie.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.590
That's a wonderful name, Brian.

20:08.592 --> 20:09.891
Stewie.

20:09.893 --> 20:11.759
Hi, Stewie.

20:11.761 --> 20:13.228
You did it, Brian.
I've got to say,

20:13.230 --> 20:15.463
I didn't think you were
gonna be able to pull it off,

20:15.465 --> 20:16.798
but you did it.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.900
You saved my life.

20:18.902 --> 20:21.736
And for that,
I shall be forever grateful.

20:21.738 --> 20:25.073
Hey, I couldn't imagine life
without you, buddy.

20:25.075 --> 20:28.309
You know, I forgot what a
man cave I had in Lois's uterus.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.145
While I was waiting for
you, I was shooting pool.

20:30.147 --> 20:33.348
Had to hold the cue at
weird angles, but still.

20:37.119 --> 20:39.854
Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing?

20:39.856 --> 20:42.991
Is he smart, or is he...
like me?

20:42.993 --> 20:45.059
He's perfect.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.802
CHRIS:
<i>You guys heard the baby</i>

20:54.804 --> 20:56.204
<i>talking in there, didn't you?</i>

20:56.206 --> 20:58.006
LOIS:
<i>Chris, that's ridiculous.</i>
