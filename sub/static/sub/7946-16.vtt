15:02.250 --> 15:03.501
A-ha! Look at

15:03.502 --> 15:04.751
your arm!

15:02.250 --> 15:04.751
I know...

15:04.792 --> 15:07.042
I've been working out.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.083
No, I mean,

15:08.084 --> 15:09.084
look at these scratches.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.042
- You got these
- in the nest!

15:11.083 --> 15:12.083
- You have
- the toupee!

15:12.918 --> 15:14.042
Hang on...

15:14.083 --> 15:15.727
- All this time you were
- trying to convince me

15:15.751 --> 15:17.334
- I can get by
- without my hair,

15:17.375 --> 15:18.792
- And it was you
- who stole it?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.125
- Hey, wait,
- I can explain.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.042
- So Luke took
- the toupee?

15:22.083 --> 15:23.209
I'm glad I'm not

15:23.210 --> 15:24.334
the only one.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.167
- Wait a minute,
- you stole it too?

15:26.209 --> 15:27.272
Actually,

15:27.273 --> 15:28.334
Luke didn't steal it.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.542
- He took it
- from a bird,

15:29.584 --> 15:31.268
- Who stole it from Zuri,
- who got it from Ravi,

15:31.292 --> 15:32.393
- Who found it
- where Emma hid it,

15:32.417 --> 15:34.334
- After she took it
- from you. Ha!

15:34.959 --> 15:36.250
Man, I'm good!

15:36.292 --> 15:37.834
- I'm gonna sell
- so much bug spray.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.792
- Okay, so
- I took it!

15:40.834 --> 15:42.418
But what was I

15:42.419 --> 15:44.000
supposed to do,

15:40.834 --> 15:44.000
leave it in that tree?

15:44.042 --> 15:45.063
I was trying to do

15:45.064 --> 15:46.083
Bertram a favor.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.209
See, Melinda had just done

15:47.210 --> 15:48.292
a double backflip,

15:48.334 --> 15:49.834
- when I noticed
- the toupee.

15:52.459 --> 15:53.938
JESSIE: Luke started yammering

15:53.939 --> 15:55.417
that the toupee was

15:52.459 --> 15:55.417
in bad shape

15:55.459 --> 15:57.042
- because he had to
- wrestle it away

15:57.083 --> 15:59.042
- From a pterodactyl
- with a temper.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.042
- I haven't seen
- this many feathers

16:01.083 --> 16:02.209
Since I got tangled up

16:02.210 --> 16:03.334
in that kick line

16:01.083 --> 16:03.334
at the Cotton Club!

16:05.334 --> 16:06.688
JESSIE: He didn't want

16:06.689 --> 16:08.042
to get caught

16:05.334 --> 16:08.042
holding the rug,

16:08.083 --> 16:09.792
- but before
- he could fix it...

16:09.834 --> 16:11.334
(BERTRAM HUMMING)

16:15.083 --> 16:17.042
Hey, Bertie!

16:17.083 --> 16:18.810
- What brings you
- into this neck of the woods?

16:18.834 --> 16:20.313
My job,

16:20.314 --> 16:21.792
unfortunately.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.459
Oh, cheer up, bub.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.668
The Great Depression

16:25.669 --> 16:26.834
is over.

16:26.876 --> 16:28.459
- You haven't seen
- my paycheck.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.375
Out!

16:36.209 --> 16:37.230
I meant to go back

16:37.231 --> 16:38.250
and get the toupee

16:36.209 --> 16:38.250
cleaned up,

16:38.292 --> 16:39.563
but I've been so busy

16:39.564 --> 16:40.834
helping Bertram

16:38.292 --> 16:40.834
with his choreography,

16:40.876 --> 16:42.167
- I totally
- forgot about it.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.584
How could you forget

16:43.585 --> 16:44.959
you had my toupee?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.188
All day I've been talking

16:46.189 --> 16:47.375
about how much I need it.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.939
In my defense,

16:48.940 --> 16:50.459
your dancing

16:47.417 --> 16:50.459
is very distracting.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.230
Okay, so apparently

16:53.231 --> 16:54.375
everyone's guilty.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.730
First thing tomorrow,

16:55.731 --> 16:57.042
I'll issue a mass grounding.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.560
- But for now, - the important
- Thing is

16:58.584 --> 16:59.834
- We know where
- the toupee is!

16:59.876 --> 17:01.042
- It's in
- the freezer!

17:01.083 --> 17:02.480
Well, an icy toupee

17:02.481 --> 17:03.876
is fine with me!

17:03.918 --> 17:04.939
It'll thaw out

17:04.940 --> 17:05.959
before my first

17:03.918 --> 17:05.959
pop 'n lock.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.460
Is he talking about

17:09.461 --> 17:10.917
his dance moves,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.917
or his joints?

17:13.459 --> 17:15.041
I don't see it!

17:15.083 --> 17:16.584
- There it is!
- My toupee?

17:16.626 --> 17:17.834
No, but I solved

17:17.835 --> 17:19.041
the mystery of

17:16.626 --> 17:19.041
the missing remote.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.250
Yay!

17:26.541 --> 17:27.935
- Now, I'm not trying
- to accuse anyone,

17:27.959 --> 17:29.268
- But one of you
- has the toupee.

17:29.292 --> 17:31.042
- Jessie, I do not mean
- to pick nits,

17:31.083 --> 17:32.272
But that is

17:32.273 --> 17:33.459
a textbook example

17:31.083 --> 17:33.459
of an accusation.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.272
Now, listen here.

17:36.273 --> 17:37.459
You were all

17:35.083 --> 17:37.459
in on the grift.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.022
You're all hoodlums, punks,

17:39.023 --> 17:40.542
goons, flimflam artists...

17:40.584 --> 17:42.042
- If she keeps
- talking like this,

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
I'm calling a doctor.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.251
Cram it,

17:46.252 --> 17:47.417
Jeeves!

17:47.459 --> 17:48.501
It's her process.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.542
Just go with it.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.209
- Now, whoever took that toupee
- out of the freezer

17:53.250 --> 17:54.585
And isn't coming clean

17:54.586 --> 17:55.918
is the lowest of the low.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.250
(CROAKING)

17:57.292 --> 17:58.542
Can it, Kippy.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.459
Perhaps Mrs. Kipling

18:01.460 --> 18:02.500
is hungry.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.293
She can't be. I just gave her

18:04.294 --> 18:06.042
some grub. Two frozen rats.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.542
(CROAKING)

18:07.584 --> 18:09.959
Really? Then that means

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
you were the last one

18:11.001 --> 18:12.001
in the freezer, Jessie.

18:12.042 --> 18:13.542
And that's where

18:13.543 --> 18:15.042
the toupee was last seen...

18:15.083 --> 18:16.542
Wait, you guys think

18:16.543 --> 18:18.000
I pinched the rug?

18:18.042 --> 18:19.459
- That's a bunch
- of hooey!

18:19.500 --> 18:21.185
- I never touched it, see,
- and I'll prove it to you.

18:21.209 --> 18:22.667
Here's what happened...

18:22.709 --> 18:23.917
JESSIE: Rat wrangling

18:23.918 --> 18:25.125
was never my favorite chore...

18:25.167 --> 18:27.584
Still, this dame was game.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.522
I gave a hungry lizard

18:30.523 --> 18:31.959
her chow, and that's all

18:29.083 --> 18:31.959
she wrote.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.042
- Anyone who thinks
- I took Bertram's toupee is...

18:34.083 --> 18:35.083
(RECORD SCRATCHING)

18:39.083 --> 18:40.375
Ugh.

18:41.542 --> 18:42.959
- There's a rat
- in this story,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.022
And it's not

18:44.023 --> 18:45.042
the one Kipling ate!

18:45.083 --> 18:46.834
You fed Bertram's toupee

18:46.835 --> 18:48.584
to Mrs. Kipling?

18:48.626 --> 18:50.292
- It was an
- honest mistake!

18:50.334 --> 18:52.292
- I didn't mean to mess up
- the toupee!

18:52.334 --> 18:54.042
We messed it up.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.209
You destroyed it.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.647
And you call yourself

18:56.648 --> 18:58.042
a fake detective.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.724
- Hey, I'm the one
- who solved the crime!

18:59.751 --> 19:01.167
- You committed
- the crime!

19:01.209 --> 19:02.643
- I'm pretty sure - those cancel
- Each other out!

19:02.667 --> 19:03.855
No, no...

19:03.856 --> 19:05.042
(ALL ARGUING)

19:05.083 --> 19:06.563
Stop it! You were all

19:06.564 --> 19:08.042
involved in this.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.355
And thanks to you,

19:09.356 --> 19:10.626
my reunion concert

19:08.083 --> 19:10.626
is ruined!

Nanny,

19:13.731 --> 19:15.000
ground thyself.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.000
Hey, Bertram.

19:21.042 --> 19:23.042
- I'm sorry I fed
- your toupee to the lizard.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.397
I tried to find a card

19:24.398 --> 19:25.709
for that, but no such luck.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.397
It's okay. You didn't know

19:28.398 --> 19:29.709
what you were doing.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.311
- Which is kind of
- par for the course.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.751
Look, Bertram,

19:34.792 --> 19:36.084
I really think

19:36.085 --> 19:37.375
you should perform

19:34.792 --> 19:37.375
with Badd Direction.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.522
You've waited

19:38.523 --> 19:39.626
25 years for this!

19:39.667 --> 19:41.355
I can't. Not without

19:41.356 --> 19:43.042
my secret weapon.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.230
Well, I've only known you

19:44.231 --> 19:45.375
without your hair, and...

19:45.417 --> 19:47.167
- I think
- you're wonderful.

19:47.209 --> 19:48.334
I mean, think of all

19:48.335 --> 19:49.459
the things you're good at.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.083
- Like what?
- Well, you can...

19:51.125 --> 19:52.709
Huh?

19:52.751 --> 19:54.375
- And there's...
- Uh...

every single one

20:01.544 --> 20:02.626
of those kids

20:00.459 --> 20:02.626
went out of their way

20:02.667 --> 20:04.459
- to make sure you
- looked great tonight.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.083

- laundry for you.

- Coming tomorrow.

- rooting for you

- on that stage tonight,

- Showing everyone
- why you still get

- Free fish
- in Finland.

20:32.876 --> 20:34.209

- but...

20:34.250 --> 20:35.272
No, no, no.

20:35.273 --> 20:36.292
No buts.

20:36.334 --> 20:37.834
- Now you get up
- on that stage

20:37.876 --> 20:39.685
- And you give those - fans what they've
- Been waiting for.

- Their social security
- checks?

20:43.250 --> 20:45.042
No!

- has a new direction,

20:46.834 --> 20:48.313

20:48.314 --> 20:49.792
better, and bald!

20:49.834 --> 20:51.751
You're right! I'm going

to go out there

20:49.834 --> 20:53.667
and give it my all!

20:53.709 --> 20:55.375
- I just hope they don't
- laugh at me.

20:55.417 --> 20:56.459
Of course

20:56.460 --> 20:57.500
they won't

20:55.417 --> 20:57.500
laugh at you!

20:57.542 --> 20:59.001
They paid $65 to see

20:57.542 --> 21:00.459

21:58.398 --> 21:59.876
Bertram's crowd surfing

21:56.918 --> 21:59.876
was rather unpleasant.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.064
His heinie is

22:01.065 --> 22:02.209
excessively sweaty.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.667
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

22:07.876 --> 22:09.376
You're all

22:09.377 --> 22:10.876
bald, too?

22:10.918 --> 22:12.584
Wow! And I thought

22:12.585 --> 22:14.250
the fans were

22:10.918 --> 22:14.250
flipping their wigs.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.730
See? All Bertram

22:15.731 --> 22:17.167
needed was

22:14.292 --> 22:17.167
a little confidence.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.271
You are all

22:21.272 --> 22:22.542
my disciples!

22:22.584 --> 22:24.188
And I...

22:24.189 --> 22:25.792
I'm a golden god!

22:27.000 --> 22:28.042
Wow.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.959
- I think we built up
- his confidence

22:30.000 --> 22:31.063
A little

22:31.064 --> 22:32.125
too much.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.480
Oh, no! He's gonna

22:33.481 --> 22:34.792
crowd surf again!

22:34.834 --> 22:36.083
Run!

22:36.125 --> 22:38.042
- (THUDDING)
- (GLASS BREAKING)

22:38.083 --> 22:39.522
JESSIE: So,

22:39.523 --> 22:40.959
the bug spray people

22:38.083 --> 22:40.959
told me to bug off.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.439
My career was as dead

22:42.440 --> 22:43.876
as those roaches.

22:43.918 --> 22:45.418
But at least I cracked

22:45.419 --> 22:46.918
the Case of the Wandering Wig.

22:47.626 --> 22:48.918
Still...

22:48.959 --> 22:50.251
There was one little question

22:50.252 --> 22:51.542
gnawing at me.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.000
- If the lizard
- ate the hair,

22:53.042 --> 22:54.959
- Then why hadn't the perp
- pooped the toup?

23:00.042 --> 23:02.000
(CROAKING)

23:03.305 --> 23:09.241
