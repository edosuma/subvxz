00:01.502 --> 00:05.106
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.342
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.211
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.244 --> 00:11.679
and by the time I got here,

00:11.712 --> 00:15.549
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.452
I hid who I really was

00:18.486 --> 00:22.656
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.094
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.465
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.499 --> 00:34.302
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.072
I am Supergirl.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.607
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:39.640 --> 00:41.809
My whole life,
I've been a sidekick.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.079
Watching my dad's camera
be destroyed
reminded me of something.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.381
He gave his life
protecting this country.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.683
And if I do this,
I can honor him.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.818
MON-EL: Mother?

00:50.851 --> 00:52.420
Father?

00:52.453 --> 00:53.454
My son.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.357
To new friends!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.559
The portal would help
your planet immensely

00:58.592 --> 01:01.129
and it would help me
get home to mine.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.230
Ready to
change the world?

01:02.263 --> 01:04.198
You have no idea.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.283
-(SCREAMS)
-What's the hurry?

01:23.717 --> 01:24.718
(SCREAMING)

01:24.752 --> 01:26.120
No!

01:28.556 --> 01:29.557
(GROANS)

01:33.461 --> 01:34.695
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:45.773 --> 01:47.208
Are you okay?

01:47.675 --> 01:49.210
Stay back!

01:49.243 --> 01:50.811
I'm here to help.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.213
Don't hurt me!

01:54.715 --> 01:55.883
WINN: James?

01:55.916 --> 01:57.451
Police are
on their way, buddy.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.486
You good?

02:00.821 --> 02:02.190
James?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.591
Let's call it a night.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.501
Okay. I mean,
I love him. I do.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.504
I... I love him. But come on.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.839
JT has got to be the only one

02:18.872 --> 02:20.241
holding up
the reunion right now.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.475
Oh, obviously.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.244
Here, but let me
ask you this, right?

02:23.277 --> 02:26.314
Would you rather
have an NSync reunion

02:26.347 --> 02:27.548
or JT and Britney
back together?

02:27.581 --> 02:30.751
-Ugh! My OTP.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:30.784 --> 02:32.486
That's an impossible
question to answer,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.422
and you are cruel for asking.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.657
Yeah. Well, you know,
sometimes my Luthor genes
just shine through.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.491
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

02:37.525 --> 02:39.693
Thanks for catching
lunch with me.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.929
Yeah. Well, since
I canceled on you
the last three times

02:41.962 --> 02:43.631
and you said
you couldn't get away,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.266
I figured you were worth
the extra effort.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.235
Yeah, what's
keeping you so busy?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.736
It's top secret.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.904
Intriguing.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.342
As soon as I can tell
anyone anything,
you will get an exclusive.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.779
I'm working
with a new partner.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.314
-KARA: Mmm.
-Yeah, she's...

03:00.348 --> 03:01.949
She's fantastic.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.485
It's... It's like having
a mentor, you know?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.354
You'll...
You'll love her. Promise.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.555
You got to
give me something.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.657
I have to have something
to look forward to.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.325
Okay. Something
to look forward to.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.394
What do you know
about quantum entanglement?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.796
-"Quantum" wh...
-Polyatomic anions?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.499
(LAUGHS)

03:18.532 --> 03:19.700
Well, when you see
what we're doing with them,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.302
-it will blow you away.
-I can't wait.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.736
-(LAUGHS)
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

03:22.770 --> 03:24.272
Oh.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.939
Actually, this is...
This is her.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.575
I'm gonna have to go,
'cause we're doing
our first test today.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.610
Oh, it was so good to see you.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.712
-Next time, lunch is on me.
-Okay. Cool.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.746
Bye.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.584
(INHALES) Hmm.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.322
JAMES:
Thanks, brother.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.491
Hey, hey! Look who it is.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.593
You know what?
I love these falafels.
Do you?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.728
Because they are,
like, the best in the city.
I gotta say.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.697
Yeah, they are
the best in the city.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.998
You know that
because I told you
about this falafel stand.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.500
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.701
And I'm totally
stalking you

03:53.734 --> 03:55.769
because, dude,
what happened?

03:55.803 --> 03:57.538
Last night you were just...

03:57.571 --> 03:59.407
You were just, like,
one and done.
That's not like you.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.742
In all honestly,
that woman was more afraid

04:01.775 --> 04:03.811
of Guardian than she was
of her attackers.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.046
That can't be true.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.381
No, dude, you didn't
see her.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.283
I'm sure she was in shock.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.618
Yeah, but it's...
It's bigger than that.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.952
It's... It's happening a lot.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.622
So, people see this big guy
in this scary mask

04:14.655 --> 04:16.657
and they freak out,
they run away.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.059
-Just like Clark's friend.
-Oh, you mean...

04:19.092 --> 04:20.861
I feel like they're
more frenemies.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.363
You know what I mean.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.533
It's just that
Guardian is not...

04:25.566 --> 04:27.668
He's not this beacon of hope
that I thought he would be.

04:27.701 --> 04:31.305
I mean, basically,
all I'm doing is
beating people up.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.473
Whoa, dude, we are...

04:32.506 --> 04:34.608
We are doing
a lot of good here.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.577
We...
We're making a difference.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.480
I mean, Supergirl, Superman,
they're making a difference.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.814
They're changing
hearts and minds.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.316
They inspire people.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.818
Guardian inspires fear.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.534
Ma'am?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.306
Oh, is that an earthquake?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.577
Ma'am, stop
what you're doing.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.947
Everybody get out of here!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.516
Go! Go, go, go, go!

05:15.549 --> 05:17.485
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go!

05:17.518 --> 05:20.588
This is Agent Schott.
We have a hostile telekinetic
in Simmons Square.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.390
Let's go!
Get out of here!

05:22.423 --> 05:23.657
(ALL SCREAMING)

05:25.793 --> 05:26.794
Watch out!

05:27.961 --> 05:29.797
Move! Move, move, move! Move!

05:43.944 --> 05:45.746
(ALL CHEERING)

05:49.717 --> 05:51.885
Hey, where'd the alien go?

05:51.919 --> 05:52.953
She's gone.

05:53.887 --> 05:54.888
I don't know.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.796
REPORTER: (ON TV)
Authorities are investigating

06:02.830 --> 06:04.565
a targeted alien
terrorist attack

06:04.598 --> 06:06.600
that occurred earlier today.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.636
Law enforcement has no leads
on the identity

06:08.669 --> 06:09.737
of the alien or motive,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.138
but tensions are on the rise

06:11.171 --> 06:13.674
as fear of another
attack...

06:13.707 --> 06:15.142
If the news
keeps stirring up fear,

06:15.175 --> 06:16.910
there's gonna be a witch hunt
for whoever this alien is.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.879
Things could
get out of hand very fast.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.449
Okay. So, we figured out
what kind of alien she is.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.116
-She's a Phorian.
-ALEX: A what?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.986
I never realized
any had taken
refuge here on Earth.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.456
Historically,
they're a peaceful
race of aliens.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.957
Today, not so peaceful.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.494
Thank God Supergirl was there.
Hundreds could've been hurt.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.028
Normally, their telekinetic
powers are benign.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.631
I've never heard of a Phorian
doing so much damage.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.433
And they're also telepathic
like Martians.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.934
They are connected
through their thoughts.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.770
Do you think
more of them will attack?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.172
For now, let's just treat
this as a lone-wolf situation.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.707
So, how do we find her?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.041
Supergirl and Mon-El are out
surveying the city

06:48.075 --> 06:50.444
to see if they can
come up with anything.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.879
I'd be happy to help.
I can get out there
and see if there's any leads.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.515
Mr. Olsen,
you've been very helpful.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.784
This is a DEO matter.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.486
We'll let you know
if we need
Guardian's skill set,

06:58.519 --> 06:59.753
-but for now...
-I got it.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.095
Today was just
our first test.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.898
You can't expect it
to be perfect
on the first attempt.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.534
I quadruple checked
my calculations on this, okay?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
The reaction
of the polyatomic anions

07:15.569 --> 07:18.238
was supposed to be
strong enough to spark
the core of the generator.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.776
Neither of us
has gotten to where we are
without persistence.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.678
If I can't make this work,
we won't be able to power

07:24.712 --> 07:26.647
the portal
that we're building.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.916
This was supposed to
revolutionize the way
everything was transported,

07:28.949 --> 07:32.019
eliminate famine,
the need for fossil fuels.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.687
I wanted to help my planet.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.022
And get you home to yours.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.525
And you will.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.092
You're making
advancements in science

07:39.126 --> 07:42.830
that most people on Earth
could not even dream of.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.833
No one said it would be easy.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.535
What if I can't
make it work?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.604
What if I can't
get you home?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.873
I have confidence
in you, Lena.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.578
I am going
to the test facility

07:57.611 --> 08:00.247
to check the progress
of the portal.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.850
I know you don't
believe it yet,

08:02.883 --> 08:05.719
but you're going
to make this work.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.639
Wh... Dude!

08:57.705 --> 08:58.939
MAN: That'll be 20.

Please, don't shoot me.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.992
Come on, it's just
a little bag of weed.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.093
It's for my anxiety.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.196
I was kidnapped recently
and I'm very, very tense.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.066
Wait! You know the attack
on Simmons Square?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.200
Yeah. What about it?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.802
That woman.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.704
The one with
all the crazy powers?

09:30.738 --> 09:32.072
Everyone's
looking for her, right?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.608
I know where she lives.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.881
(DOOR CREAKS)

10:17.017 --> 10:18.018
Wait!

10:23.991 --> 10:25.025
It's okay.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.027
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.904
It's all right, see?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.172
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.057
We've been in here
a long time.

Mmm. This

11:06.333 --> 11:08.001
is a really good burger.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.273
Okay.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.077
I know you don't
wanna be here with me.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.849
I'm just trying to
help you, Marcus.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.483
I'm trying to help you
and your mom.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.452
I promise you that.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.221
But the authorities
are after her

11:28.255 --> 11:30.290
because she did
a bad thing.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.729
And if you help us find her,
then we can protect her

11:35.763 --> 11:38.966
from doing something bad
to somebody else.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.870
So do you have any idea
where she could be?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.341
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

11:48.375 --> 11:51.344
Maybe she should give him,
like, some action figures.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.980
Right?

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
Like, if somebody
had given me
action figures

11:55.048 --> 11:58.051
when they interrogated me
about my dad
when I was 10,

11:58.085 --> 11:59.052
like, I would...

11:59.086 --> 12:01.488
I would've sung
like a canary.
I'm just saying.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.156
This kid
is completely shut down.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.025
And pulling him into
an interrogation room

12:05.058 --> 12:06.760
like some criminal
off the street,

12:06.794 --> 12:09.096
I don't think
is the best way
to get him to open up.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.431
So, you're not only
a masked vigilante

12:11.464 --> 12:15.102
and a photographer,
you're also
a child psychologist now.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.371
I'm just saying this kid's
life has been upended badly.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.007
Okay, first,
he's a refugee.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.441
Then his mom
ends up missing.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.844
And if he's turned on
the TV at all since yesterday,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.546
all he's seen are adults
yelling about her,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.248
calling for blood.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.317
I wouldn't trust
anybody either,
if I was this kid.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.518
James is right.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.020
I've been in there for hours,

12:33.053 --> 12:34.888
and all he does
is just stare at the camera.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.897
He's looking at you.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.866
(LAUGHS)

12:45.899 --> 12:47.400
At... At me?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.002
Through a wall, Alex?

12:53.406 --> 12:56.910
He's an alien with telekinetic
and telepathic powers.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.511
Hey, look at that.
It's like the...

12:58.545 --> 13:00.280
The... The Mona Lisa.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.149
You said that he
connected with you.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.851
He thought
the Guardian
was a monster,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.185
and then I
took my helmet off,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.054
and I guess he saw someone
who looked like him.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.122
He identified
with you, James.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.024
Are you saying you want
Mr. Olsen to question the boy?

13:11.058 --> 13:12.926
Well, Marcus
doesn't trust me.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.828
Okay? But he
could trust James.

13:14.862 --> 13:15.996
I mean, out of here.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.031
In a more
conducive environment.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.901
We have to find his mother
before she attacks again.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.170
If I can help this kid,
I'd like to.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.473
All right.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.877
Take the day,
see if you can find out
where the boy's mother is.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.311
We'll check in
with you later.

13:35.215 --> 13:39.286
Hey...
You'll be good with him.

Uh...

13:53.333 --> 13:57.037

you, like...
You do here, right?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.039
Yes.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.174
Yes. Here at the DEO,
we scan for many things.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.010
Mmm-hmm.
So, you could, like...

14:03.043 --> 14:04.544
You could, like,
press a button

14:04.577 --> 14:09.116
and it would scan
the Earth's orbit for,
like, my parents' ship.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.583
I certainly could,
but I already did that

14:10.617 --> 14:12.119
when they led us
back to Earth.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.988
I tracked their progress
as they went out

14:15.022 --> 14:17.624
of Earth's atmosphere
and flew away to Daxam.
Bye-bye.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.360
Can you show me
how you did that?

14:21.294 --> 14:22.329
Yeah.

it down in disgust

14:51.158 --> 14:53.093

that gave it away?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.463

14:58.131 --> 15:01.134
Failure is a part
of the process, Lena.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.136
I told you
this was going to take time.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.673
It's not about time.
I'm just not getting it.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.976
You know, maybe
we should pay a visit
to Stryker Island.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.311
Get Lex Luthor to come in
and save the day.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
You think he could
get this working?

15:13.480 --> 15:16.349
Lex was the genius
who was supposed to
save the world.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.285
You know, I...

15:18.318 --> 15:20.153
I just thought
if I could make this work,

15:20.187 --> 15:23.523
I would prove to the world
and to my mother

15:23.556 --> 15:26.493
that I was as good as
the golden boy.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.329
I think most of all,
I just wanted
to prove it to myself.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.298
You don't have to
prove anything.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.434

I'm saying it as a scientist.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.973
As someone who knows.

15:41.308 --> 15:45.112
But you need to stop trying to
think like your brother.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.147
From what you've
told me about Lex,

15:47.180 --> 15:50.650
he's a man
who's concerned with power.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.186
And that's how you've been
trying to fix this.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.722
Give it more power,
you think it will work.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.390
Yeah, but it just
keeps blowing.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.560
But you're not a person
who's consumed with power.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.462
Are you?

16:02.495 --> 16:06.099
So, if you weren't
trying to do
what Lex would do,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.369
what would you do?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.572
I'd try to find a way
to increase the anion input

I've had this one forever.

to be a photographer
in the first place.

right before he passed away.

escaping our planet.

to hear that.

I saw her, it...

make me feel anger.

which should prevent him
from having another episode.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.717
Well, he's safe,
but his mother's
still out there.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.119
We need to get him
to tell us where she is.

24:47.153 --> 24:52.559
Well, our best chance at that
now is Mr. Olsen.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.562
James.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.997
I spent the entire day
with that kid

24:58.030 --> 24:59.966
and all I got
was a couple of sentences.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.970
You were right, J'onn.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.539
This is a DEO matter.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.940
I should not have
involved myself.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.920
J'ONN J'ONZZ: James.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.323
Look, I know
what I said earlier on,

25:24.356 --> 25:26.693
but we could really
use your help here.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.827
It has to be you.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.897
Why?
Because I'm black?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.298
You look the same
as he does too.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.701
-Why don't you talk to him?
-It's more than that.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.637
He sees something in you.

25:37.670 --> 25:41.641
I brought him to CatCo
and I risked
everybody's safety.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.176
Supergirl had to come
save everybody.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.845
Me, him...

25:45.878 --> 25:49.315
She kept everybody safe
and I had no idea what to do.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.783
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

25:50.817 --> 25:52.885
You know,
I remember that feeling.

25:52.919 --> 25:57.924
On Mars, we were encouraged
to decide our line of work
when we were very young.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.828
Everyone had no problem
pinpointing their futures.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.196
I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.898
I was just waiting for a sign.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.300
Did you find one?

26:08.334 --> 26:10.002
My first daughter.

26:10.036 --> 26:13.740
When she came along,
I finally realized
I had a mission in life.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.175
I had someone
who relied on me.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.210
Having her gave me direction.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.312
Protecting her
made me realize

26:20.346 --> 26:23.282
I had a gift
for keeping people safe.

26:23.315 --> 26:27.787
So I, um... I joined
the law enforcement on Mars.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.190
I became
the Martian Manhunter.

26:32.391 --> 26:36.028
And you think
me talking to Marcus

26:36.062 --> 26:38.097
would give me
that kind of purpose?

26:38.130 --> 26:42.034
I saw a reflection
of myself in my daughter.

26:42.068 --> 26:47.006
I think you already
see a reflection
of yourself in him.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.945
You want to find out
what kind of hero you can be?

26:52.979 --> 26:55.147
Right here
is a great place to start.

27:01.888 --> 27:05.257
We've been searching the city
for signs of another attack,
nothing yet.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.726
Have you two found anything?

27:06.759 --> 27:08.227
We looked into
the Phorian's physiology.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.229
Turns out that a major shift
in atmospheric energy

27:10.262 --> 27:13.365
can cause a change
in their mental state.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.101
But what causes
a shift like that?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.970
Okay. So, this measures
electromagnetic activity
around the city.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.140
There was a large spike
around the time of the first
fight on the street yesterday.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.410
And let me guess,
another spike during
the attack on CatCo today?

27:24.443 --> 27:25.812
WINN:
Hey, good guess.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.147
But that spike was about
five times the size.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.849
Have we determined
what caused the spike?

27:29.882 --> 27:32.151
Yes. High levels of polyatomic
anions released

27:32.184 --> 27:33.285
in the atmosphere.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.754
Wait. I... I saw Lena.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.422
She said she's working
on a new project.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.891
She mentioned those anions.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.392
That can't be
a coincidence, can it?

27:40.426 --> 27:42.294
Definitely not.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.696
I'm gonna call Lena.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.802
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

27:53.873 --> 27:55.775
Hello, Supergirl.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.681
Rhea?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.051
You sound surprised.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.086
-Trace the call.
-If you've done
anything to Lena...

28:07.119 --> 28:08.921
You'll what,
lecture me?

28:08.955 --> 28:10.256
We will find you.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.926
You have no idea where I am
or what I'm doing.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.428
How does it feel
to be powerless?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.230
If this is about Mon-El,
you have to come to terms

28:18.264 --> 28:20.466
with the fact that
he chose to stay here.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.769
No, he made a choice
to come home,

28:22.802 --> 28:24.203
to be king to his people.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.138
And we would
have been happy to go,

28:26.172 --> 28:28.941
but you were too selfish
to allow that.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.476
What's she saying?

28:30.509 --> 28:32.478
-(SPEAKERPHONE BEEPS)
-Everything I do,
I do for my people.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.080
Everything you do for yours

28:34.113 --> 28:36.315
is to bolster
your broken ego.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.885
You need this planet
to worship you,

28:38.918 --> 28:42.021
the last daughter
of a failed world,

28:42.054 --> 28:45.124
because otherwise,
your survival means nothing.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.225
You're delusional.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.193
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) No.

28:47.226 --> 28:51.097
On the contrary,
I see everything clearly.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.100
I came here in peace,
which you refused.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.069
And all of the ugliness
that's transpired

28:57.103 --> 29:00.406
is because of your
righteousness, Kara Zor-El.

29:00.439 --> 29:04.911
Everything that happens
from now on is your doing.

29:04.944 --> 29:09.081
Every city that burns,
every nation that falls,

29:09.115 --> 29:12.251
for every child of Earth
that cries out,

29:12.284 --> 29:14.253
"Why is this happening?"

29:14.286 --> 29:17.857
The answer is Supergirl.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.092
Kara has done nothing. Okay?

29:20.126 --> 29:20.960
This is all you!

29:20.993 --> 29:22.995
Oh, of course
you're there with her.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.264
The Kryptonian girl
who bewitched you.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.266
Mother, you're...
You're mad at me here, okay?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.101
Don't... Don't take it
out on this planet.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.302
You are better than this.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.872
Anger has nothing to do
with what I'm doing.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.841
Then why?
Why are you still here?

29:34.874 --> 29:37.877
I'm here to
wake you up, Mon-El.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.214
Did you manage
to trace the call?

29:42.248 --> 29:44.083
No. There was too much
electromagnetic interference.

29:44.583 --> 29:45.918
(SIGHS)

29:48.487 --> 29:51.223
-Was that my phone?
-Yeah.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.859
Telemarketer.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.831
Hey, Marcus.

29:58.865 --> 30:00.499
Look, I know that
you didn't mean

30:00.532 --> 30:03.269
to attack everybody
the way that you did before.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.104
Okay?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.074
And neither did your mom.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.379
Look, all I'm trying to do
is make sure

30:13.412 --> 30:16.115
that everybody who saw
her picture on the news

30:17.316 --> 30:19.185
knows that's not
the real her, right?

30:21.253 --> 30:25.291
Every planet we go to,
they make us go away.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.826
What do you mean?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.963
They always try to hurt us.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.431
They think we're bad.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.233
I thought it would be
different here.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.369
I liked it here.

30:41.140 --> 30:46.212
When I was a kid,
I used to get bullied.

30:46.245 --> 30:50.516
See, I went to a school
where there weren't a lot of
people who looked like me.

30:50.549 --> 30:57.089
And then when my dad died,
it just got a lot worse.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.326
See, he was...
He was my guardian.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.997
He was the guy
that made me feel safe.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.301
So, after he was gone,
I just...

31:09.335 --> 31:10.436
I put up this wall.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.272
And I didn't let anybody in.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.243
Until I moved to Metropolis,

31:17.276 --> 31:20.146
and then I made a new friend.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.049
And this guy
was different, too.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.652
And I didn't realize
how different he was.

31:26.685 --> 31:30.389
I just knew that
he understood something
that most people didn't.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.491
And because of that,
I trusted him.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.228
And eventually,
I let him in.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.267
Do you know
what happened?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.371
That wall came down.

31:49.741 --> 31:55.181
You see, Marcus,
sometimes you
can meet somebody

31:55.214 --> 31:57.049
and they can become
your friend.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.386
And by trusting them,

32:00.419 --> 32:02.989
everything in your life
can change.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.425
I can see her.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.528
My mom.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.164
Can you?

32:12.198 --> 32:13.299
But I don't know
where she is.

32:13.332 --> 32:18.170
It's somewhere
I've never seen before.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.673
Can you take me to her?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.209
You'll protect her?

32:25.044 --> 32:26.545
I will protect you both.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.414
I promise.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.455
Okay, we're now monitoring
all electromagnetic activity
within the region.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.057
If anyone powers up
this device,

32:38.090 --> 32:39.191
we're gonna know
exactly where they are.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.726
Good.
Then we can strike.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.995
Marcus knows where his mom is,
but he's gotta take us to her.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.231
I'm afraid I can't
let him out of here.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.766
Mon-El's mother created
some sort of device
with Lena Luthor.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.435
She could set it off
at any moment.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.737
It's just not safe for Marcus
outside of containment.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.072
But his mom
is still out there.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.606
I could...
I could go with them.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.775
I have a mobile version
of that telekinetic dampener.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.410
It should have
plenty of juice

32:58.444 --> 33:02.014
to keep Marcus and his mom
from going all Carrie.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.483
I'm sorry, guys.
It's too risky.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.453
J'onn, you said that
you found your mission
with your daughter.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.556
This is mine.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.094
Be safe, James.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.462
Thank you.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.496
Let's go.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.272
Marcus, be careful.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.341

33:31.277 --> 33:32.278
Marcus?

33:35.314 --> 33:36.382

33:37.816 --> 33:40.286
-Marcus.
-Mom.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.094

These are my friends.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.295

33:51.130 --> 33:52.631
Thank you.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.135
Look, we know that you did not
attack the square on purpose.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.304
-It's okay. You're safe now.
-How?

33:58.337 --> 34:02.641
This bad boy
is gonna protect you.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.078
-All of us?

never to doubt yourself again.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.485
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
Why won't it turn off?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.254
I don't know,
she must've made it
self-sustaining somehow.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.455
What did you do, Mother?

36:30.556 --> 36:32.258
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
-Marcus.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.826
I need you
to look at me.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.329
I told you I would
keep you and your mother safe

36:37.363 --> 36:40.566
and I am not
breaking that promise.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.534
You're bringing
something here.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.669
What?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.472
You'll see.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.341
(GRUNTS)

36:50.942 --> 36:52.444
-(THUDS)
-RHEA: Argh!

36:53.279 --> 36:54.446
(CLATTERING)

36:57.283 --> 36:59.618
(THUD)

36:59.651 --> 37:03.455
Marcus,
I need you to hear me.

37:03.489 --> 37:06.458
I need you to let me in
like you would
let a real friend in.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.295
James, it's not working.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.496
We have to get out of here.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.298
I'm not leaving them!

37:18.970 --> 37:20.372
(CRASH)

37:22.508 --> 37:24.810
You don't mess with my family.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.545
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

37:29.448 --> 37:31.483
What is that?

37:31.517 --> 37:33.485
A White Martian gave me this.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.554
What are you doing?

37:35.587 --> 37:38.790
The White Martians
developed this technology

37:38.824 --> 37:41.427
in order to keep the Greens

37:41.460 --> 37:42.861
under their control.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.535
It traps a Martian
in his own mind.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.937
A never-ending
nightmare.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.039
Pretty savvy if you ask me.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.474
-(THUD)
-J'onn!

37:56.074 --> 37:57.643
J'onn!

37:58.977 --> 38:01.480
You've learned
a lot of things

38:01.513 --> 38:02.881
about this world, Mother.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.784
I've had to.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.554
And did you learn
that we're not
bulletproof here?

38:11.022 --> 38:12.658
Whoa.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.426
James!

38:14.460 --> 38:16.662
You just have to
look inside of yourself

38:16.695 --> 38:20.732
and see the strength
and the courage
that I see in you.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.302
You're not alone.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.573
You are not alone!

38:31.777 --> 38:32.778
JAMES: Hey.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.691
That is a hero without a suit.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.001
Put the gun down, Mon-El.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.569
You don't want to hurt me...

38:57.603 --> 38:58.637
Shut up!

38:58.670 --> 39:00.472
The Kryptonian girl was right.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.876
You are a hero of Earth.

39:06.478 --> 39:09.848
But would a hero
kill his own mother?

39:13.184 --> 39:16.422
When you were a boy
and I would put you
to sleep at night,

39:18.056 --> 39:20.358
you used to say to me

39:21.026 --> 39:22.861
that you would
always love me.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.499
And even though
you've turned
your back on me,

39:28.099 --> 39:29.735
I know you love me.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.638
Where's Father?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.944
Where is my father?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.648
Your father was so hurt

39:43.715 --> 39:45.751
when you abandoned us
that he

39:46.918 --> 39:48.420
took his own life.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.491
No.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.060
Mon-El, you are not
going to kill me.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.795
Whatever you think of me,

39:58.096 --> 39:59.665
I'm still your mother.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.567
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:18.249 --> 40:21.953
We were not the only people
to escape the destruction
of our planet.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.524
Thousands of
Daxamites survived.

40:26.825 --> 40:30.462
Hundreds of ships
spread across the galaxy.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.564
They just needed
a way to get here.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.619
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

40:55.721 --> 40:57.923
-Agent Danvers...
-Yeah.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.091
We have
multiple bogies heading
into National City.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.727
-How many?
-Twenty-five,

41:01.760 --> 41:03.529
No, 50, 100...
Maybe more.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.863
What's happening?

41:28.920 --> 41:30.055
Welcome

41:31.557 --> 41:33.959
to New Daxam.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.528
(WHOOSHING)
