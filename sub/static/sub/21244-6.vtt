00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.580 --> 00:06.080
Previously...

00:06.080 --> 00:07.960
I was wondering
if you'd be willing

00:07.960 --> 00:12.960
to talk to the Organization
about officially recruiting me.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.540
( cackles )

00:15.540 --> 00:16.960
Oh, you're serious.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.500
Interesting. You wanna
go to college,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.460
but the Organization
is trying to stop you,

00:22.460 --> 00:24.080
sort of like how I want
to be a spy,

00:24.080 --> 00:25.790
and you're trying
to stop me.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.080
Marisa, I'm just
trying to protect you.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.120
Maybe I don't need
protecting.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.420
Maybe I'm not the dumb weak friend
that you seem to think I am.

00:31.420 --> 00:32.500
I didn't mean--

00:32.500 --> 00:35.250
And you don't care
about protecting me.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.620
It is all about you
and what you want.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.790
It is always about you,

00:39.790 --> 00:41.830
and I am so sick of it,
so you know what?

00:41.830 --> 00:44.120
I am making a choice.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.460
I'm backing off
this friendship.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.040
Taking a break from you.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.040
Hey, stranger.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.580
Haven't talked
to you all day,

00:59.580 --> 01:01.830
except if you count
earlier, you know,

01:01.830 --> 01:03.500
in the hallway where
I said, "Hey, Marisa,"

01:03.500 --> 01:05.710
and you ignored me
and ran away.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.880
I didn't know
you can run that fast.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.460
You should try out
for track.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.040
Well, is this seat taken?

01:15.040 --> 01:17.380
Oh, no. Have a seat.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.250
Oh, cool.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.750
Over there.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.420
On second thought,
I will just stand.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.210
Mmm.
Yummy.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.290
Spaghetti.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.460
Remember. Remember
when we were kids,

01:34.460 --> 01:35.710
we used to call it
"pasketti"?

01:35.710 --> 01:38.580
Aw!
Good times.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.620
( clears throat )

01:40.620 --> 01:43.290
Okay, Marisa, come on. How long
are you gonna be mad at me?

01:43.290 --> 01:45.040
KC, what part of
"taking a break"

01:45.040 --> 01:46.830
do you not understand?

01:46.830 --> 01:48.290
I'm not saying I'm
never gonna talk to you again,

01:48.290 --> 01:50.290
because clearly,
I'm talking to you right now,

01:50.290 --> 01:52.000
but I'm only talking
to you right now

01:52.000 --> 01:53.670
to tell you I don't
wanna talk to you anymore,

01:53.670 --> 01:55.500
so if you could go away
so I can stop talking to you.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.580
Okay, Marisa,
we both know

01:57.580 --> 01:59.710
that eventually, we're
just gonna hug it out,

01:59.710 --> 02:01.500
get fro-yo and be
besties again.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.000
Can we just skip
to the fro-yo part,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.460
and get this
over with, please?

02:04.460 --> 02:08.170
Oh, KC, thank you
for explaining it to me,

02:08.170 --> 02:10.040
because as you
previously mentioned,

02:10.040 --> 02:11.880
when I said I wanted
to be a spy,

02:11.880 --> 02:13.880
that I'm not very bright.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.500
But now, thanks to you,
I understand everything,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.500
and in case you missed it,
I'm being sarcastic.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.500
Nope. Pretty much
nailed that.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.710
Well, can I at least
sit with you,

02:27.710 --> 02:29.880
'cause I know
you hate eating alone.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.460
I'm not eating alone.

02:31.460 --> 02:35.290
I'm having lunch with
my good friend Joe.

02:35.290 --> 02:37.420
Uh, I'm not Joe.
My name is Brady.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.080
Yeah, right.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.080
But we're such good friends
that I call him Joe.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.580
It's a nickname for Brady.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.500
Actually, it's
a nickname for Joseph.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
- Yeah, she's right.
- ( forced laughter )

02:51.500 --> 02:54.620
You're so funny, Joe.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.420
Hey, remember when
we were kids,

02:56.420 --> 02:59.670
and we used to call
this "pasketti"?

02:59.670 --> 03:02.500
No, 'cause I just met you.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.710
Okay, well,

03:04.710 --> 03:07.460
I'm starting to sense you won't
be forgiving me any time soon,

03:07.460 --> 03:10.290
so I will just
eat lunch with this guy.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.120
Cool. Pull up a chair.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.830
On second thought,
I'll go to the library.

No. No, no, no.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.540
This cannot be happening.
Mom!

04:17.540 --> 04:19.460
What, are we under attack?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.460
Or worse, is Mrs. Goldfeder
coming over

04:21.460 --> 04:23.750
with family vacation photos?

04:23.750 --> 04:25.880
No. Marisa is walking
to school with some lanky guy

04:25.880 --> 04:27.620
named Brady.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.420
I'm supposed to be
her only lanky friend.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.290
Now I'm completely
friendless.

04:32.290 --> 04:34.620
Unless she's just
doing this to annoy me.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.290
If you're telling this story
to annoy me,

04:36.290 --> 04:38.710
it's working.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.670
Judy, can't you see
that KC's upset?

04:41.670 --> 04:43.880
Honey, look,
it's gonna be all right.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.290
Marisa's been your best friend
since you were three years old.

04:46.290 --> 04:48.290
She's a part of your life,
and a part of this family.

04:48.290 --> 04:51.290
Part of the reason
this town has a teen curfew.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.580
But Mom, you
weren't there, okay?

04:53.580 --> 04:56.000
You didn't hear
the things she said to me.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.920
Honey,
these things happen.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.830
I used to fight like
two cats in a pillowcase

04:59.830 --> 05:01.420
with my best friend Josie.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.210
You didn't invent
teen drama.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.170
This is not teen drama.
This is the end of my life!

05:07.790 --> 05:11.830
I guess she really did
save the drama for her mama.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.960
Judy, please.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.500
I mean, what else
was I supposed to do?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.120
Go to the Organization
and say,

05:17.120 --> 05:18.670
"Yeah, my best friend
Marisa,

05:18.670 --> 05:20.420
who hasn't read a book
since Where's Waldo,

05:20.420 --> 05:22.710
is completely qualified
to be a spy."

05:22.710 --> 05:24.500
Now she'll never
talk to me,

05:24.500 --> 05:26.290
and I'm gonna die
all alone.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.290
All right.
Calm down.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.460
Just go and make it right
between the two of you.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.960
Otherwise, I'm gonna have
to be your new best friend.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.830
Yep, and we'll get
matching track pants,

05:35.830 --> 05:38.750
and spend
all our time together.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.330
Okay, I'll apologize to
Marisa until she forgives me.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.330
Can I ask you a question
about parenting?

05:46.330 --> 05:48.330
Mm-hmm.
What's up?

05:48.330 --> 05:50.920
Is it hard for you to pretend that
you actually care about this stuff?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.250
Don't you ever just
wanna laugh in her face?

05:53.250 --> 05:54.830
You know something, Judy.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.500
If you wanna pass
as a human being,

05:56.500 --> 05:58.420
you might try
acting like one.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.250
You need to learn
empathy, missy.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.420
Instead of making
your little snide remarks,

06:02.420 --> 06:03.790
try actually taking
an interest in people.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.080
If you want interest,
open a savings account

06:08.080 --> 06:10.380
at the bank of who cares!

06:10.380 --> 06:12.120
Oh.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.540
That does sound kinda bad.

06:20.420 --> 06:21.710
Oh, whoops a daisy.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.920
Dropped my papers.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.790
Oh. Hey, Monique.

06:25.790 --> 06:27.790
Hi, Ernie.

06:27.790 --> 06:30.500
Our model UN team really killed it
this week against Madison High, huh?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.960
Yeah, in fact,

06:31.960 --> 06:33.500
I'm throwing a little
celebration for the team

06:33.500 --> 06:35.330
at my house
tomorrow night.

06:35.330 --> 06:38.460
France is coming, Italy's
coming, India's coming.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.420
- You should come too, Canada.
- I'd love to.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.710
- I'll wear my traditional Canadian garb.
- Which is?

06:43.710 --> 06:46.460
- Exactly what I'm wearing.
- All right.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.540
- What time does the party start.
- Whenever you get there.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.920
Okay.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.420
Hey, Marisa, um...

07:01.420 --> 07:04.420
I just wanted to say that you were
100% right and I was 100% wrong.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.540
Wouldn't that make me
200% right?

07:06.540 --> 07:08.290
Okay, you're not
making this very easy.

07:08.290 --> 07:11.080
But look,
I hate this, okay?

07:11.080 --> 07:12.500
I miss you,
and I miss us,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.500
and I will do anything
to make it up to you.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.750
- Wow, you really are sorry.
- Yes, I am.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.330
And you'll do anything
to make it up to me?

07:21.330 --> 07:25.000
Well...
except that.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.710
Then we have
nothing else to talk about.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.380
Fine.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.120
Hey, Marisa.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.500
Who's that girl again?

07:37.500 --> 07:40.620
No one. Just someone
I used to be friends with.

07:40.620 --> 07:43.250
Let's go.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.500
Hey, is this Joanna?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.540
Hey, yeah, this is KC.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.750
Um, I was just connecting
with some old friends

07:54.750 --> 07:56.460
to see if you wanted
to hang out tonight.

07:58.420 --> 07:59.920
KC Cooper.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.500
Uh, from Girl Scouts.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.750
Tall, dark brown hair.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.330
Big feet.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.000
Uh, oh,
you remember that time

08:12.000 --> 08:13.380
I accidentally got gum
stuck in your hair,

08:13.380 --> 08:15.500
and then your mom
had to cut it out,

08:15.500 --> 08:17.170
and it left
a little bald patch,

08:17.170 --> 08:19.000
and we just laughed
and laughed and...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.080
Hello?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.960
Hello.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.420
Well, there goes
both of 'em.

08:26.420 --> 08:29.710
Oh, hey, Judy. Will
you hang out with me?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.540
Sure. Just until
I find my headphones.

08:32.540 --> 08:34.670
Oh, there they are.
Hang's over.

08:34.670 --> 08:36.420
Wait, wait, wait.

08:36.420 --> 08:38.750
It's just,
you know,

08:38.750 --> 08:40.620
Marisa's not
talking to me,

08:40.620 --> 08:43.380
and I don't really have
anything else to do tonight.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.420
Believe it or not,
I don't have that many friends.

08:45.420 --> 08:46.670
No, I believe it.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.460
Oh ho ho,
oh, oui, oui.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.080
( knocking on door )

09:02.500 --> 09:04.380
( clears throat )

09:04.380 --> 09:07.500
Hello, Canada.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.000
On behalf of Japan,
I want to welcome you

09:10.000 --> 09:11.620
to my Model UN
feast-ival.

09:11.620 --> 09:12.830
I made food from
every country

09:12.830 --> 09:14.500
represented
by our team.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.250
Impressive.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.500
The only thing
you don't have

09:17.500 --> 09:20.960
is our team.
Where is everyone?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.960
Oh, yeah, they all canceled
at the last minute,

09:23.960 --> 09:27.000
except for Switzerland, who never
committed in the first place.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.670
( forced laughter )

09:29.670 --> 09:33.670
Ah, UN humor.
Never gets old, huh?

09:34.790 --> 09:36.670
So it's just
the two of us?

09:36.670 --> 09:39.170
Hey, their loss
is our gain.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.880
Our weight gain.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.880
So what country
are tater skins from?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.880
The People's Republic
of Idaho?

09:46.880 --> 09:50.380
( forced laughter )

09:50.380 --> 09:51.670
That's funny.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.880
I love you...
I mean, I love that joke.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.080
Hey, what's going on
down here?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.330
Oh, we're celebrating the
success of our Model UN team.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.250
Oh, cool.
Hey, can I have some?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.880
- There's not enough.
- Don't be silly, Ernie.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.960
There's literally enough
for the actual UN.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.120
Would you like
to join us?

10:09.120 --> 10:10.750
Absolutely.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.500
Join us.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.920
Yeah, everyone else
canceled.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.500
The more,
the merrier.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.250
Come on,
what do you say?

10:18.250 --> 10:20.250
Make sure you say
the right thing.

10:23.170 --> 10:25.250
You know what?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.790
I will join you.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.790
And here I was thinking
I had nothing to do tonight.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.420
Turns out there's a party
in my own house.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.920
( laughs )

10:40.290 --> 10:42.620
Oh, this looks dope.
Where's this from?

10:42.620 --> 10:47.250
It's an Estonian cheese from
a region known as Buttinsky.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.120
Huh. Never heard of it.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.790
Really, KC?

10:50.790 --> 10:53.210
Because I'm pretty sure
you've been there many times.

10:53.210 --> 10:55.210
Some might say you're the
honorary mayor of Buttinsky.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.500
Wait a minute.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.460
KC? How did I not
put this together?

10:59.460 --> 11:01.250
You're the KC Cooper
who founded

11:01.250 --> 11:03.330
Hamilton High's
Model UN group.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.040
Guilty.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.170
I can't believe I'm here
with the KC Cooper.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.710
You're, like, a legend.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.750
Oh, stop it.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.960
Yes, it's true,
she's a legend.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.830
And like most legends,

11:15.830 --> 11:17.290
she doesn't like to talk
about her accomplishments.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.710
She likes to sit alone
in her room,

11:18.710 --> 11:20.670
and remember
the good old days.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.830
Go ahead, KC.
Go back to your room.

11:23.830 --> 11:26.880
Go remember.
Go on.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.620
You were just a freshman

11:28.620 --> 11:31.330
when your Model UN team
got to the New York finals.

11:31.330 --> 11:33.830
Yeah. You know,
I will never forget

11:33.830 --> 11:36.460
giving my keynote address in front
of the actual General Assembly.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.040
No way! You have to
tell us all about it.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.380
Does she?
Does she really?

11:41.380 --> 11:43.790
Ernie, sh!
KC's talking.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.040
You know, honestly, guys,

11:46.040 --> 11:48.210
it's been so long,
I barely remember the details.

11:48.210 --> 11:49.880
Hey, how about
some tacos?

11:49.880 --> 11:52.920
But I do believe it went
a little something like this.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.250
My esteemed colleagues
at the United Nations.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.830
I believe it was Boutros
Boutros-Ghali who once said,

11:57.830 --> 12:00.830
"With the rise of
our economic globalization,

12:00.830 --> 12:03.330
it is more pressing
now than ever

12:03.330 --> 12:05.420
that we not leave behind the
developing nations of the world."

12:05.420 --> 12:06.880
Is she kidding me?

12:06.880 --> 12:10.460
No. Boutros Boutros-Ghali
really said that.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.120
Now sh!

12:12.120 --> 12:13.710
Yeah, okay? While you're
at it, make me a taco.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.460
It's gonna be
a long speech.

12:24.330 --> 12:27.080
That was the best nap
I have ever had.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.380
I love algebra class.

12:29.380 --> 12:33.290
Wait, this isn't
algebra class.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.670
Am I in a dream?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.500
I hope it's not that one
where I'm a fish,

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
and I spend
all my time in school.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.880
( distorted voice )
Marisa Miller.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.250
Yes.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.620
We've been watching you.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.620
We know what you did
to bring down

12:46.620 --> 12:48.250
the head of
the Other Side.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.670
We're very impressed.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.330
I'm sorry.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.920
Can you say that again?

12:53.920 --> 12:56.080
I can barely
understand what you're saying,

12:56.080 --> 12:57.790
and it sounded like
something important,

12:57.790 --> 12:59.830
like a compliment.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.790
Is this better?

13:01.790 --> 13:03.460
(voice deepens )
Is this better?

13:03.460 --> 13:05.710
Much.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.170
As I was saying, we're impressed
with your intelligence,

13:08.170 --> 13:10.420
and we'd like you
to join the Organization.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.830
I'd love to!

13:11.830 --> 13:13.330
You're not interested.

13:13.330 --> 13:15.330
No, I totally am.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.330
Just tell us, and we'll
wipe your memory.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.620
No, I'm committed.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.670
- What?
- I said I'm committed.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.460
You know what? I'm having
trouble hearing you now.

13:24.460 --> 13:25.540
I'll just come in.

13:34.540 --> 13:37.420
Welcome to
the Organization, Marisa.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.330
Brady?
You are a spy?

13:40.330 --> 13:41.330
Yes, I am.

13:41.330 --> 13:42.750
What a coincidence

13:42.750 --> 13:45.080
that we just, like,
randomly met at school.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.120
Wait, it wasn't
a coincidence, was it?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.460
I'm gonna be
good at this.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.920
After you.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.920
Hey. You're already here.
Wait, am I late?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.710
No, you're right on time.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.500
I always arrive early
so I can practice saying

14:05.500 --> 14:06.790
the hard-to-pronounce
menu items.

14:06.790 --> 14:09.210
You know, my friend Marisa,

14:09.210 --> 14:11.670
she actually once pronounced
scissors as "skissors."

14:11.670 --> 14:13.540
( laughter )

14:13.540 --> 14:17.210
Forget about her, 'cause tonight
is about new friendships.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.580
I really like
your jacket.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.460
Oh, thanks.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
Okay, go ahead.

14:22.460 --> 14:26.040
- Let the fire storm of mocking begin.
- Excuse me?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.750
No, it's all right, girl, I can handle it.
Um, try something like this.

14:28.750 --> 14:32.290
KC, nice shoes. Do they
come in girl sizes?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.080
It's funny because
I got big feet,

14:38.080 --> 14:40.250
and you know,
guy shoes.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.670
I actually think
your look is really cool.

14:44.670 --> 14:47.380
Oh. Thanks.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.580
Did you ever consider
dying your hair blonde?

14:53.580 --> 14:55.670
- Why would I do that?
- No reason.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.210
Look, there's KC.
I knew she believed in me.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.500
I'm gonna go over
and thank her

15:02.500 --> 15:04.380
for recommending me
to be a spy.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.380
She never recommended you.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.210
Of course she did.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.210
Why else would you have
invited me to play?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.460
You mean recruited you.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.000
Right. Still learning
the lingo.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.460
So wait.
KC didn't recommend me?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.290
Then why did you
recruit me?

15:21.290 --> 15:23.170
Marisa, we've been
keeping an eye on you.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.500
We think that you are
really smart,

15:25.500 --> 15:27.290
and have the potential
to be a great spy.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.290
Thank you.

15:29.290 --> 15:32.330
I can't wait to rub this
in KC's face.

15:32.330 --> 15:35.880
Actually, she can't know that you're
a spy and that I'm your handler.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.080
- Why not?
- No idea.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.290
The Organization just
wants her to think

15:40.290 --> 15:42.460
I'm another student at Hamilton.
Just following orders.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.960
So she really never
recommended me?

15:44.960 --> 15:46.620
Sorry, no.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.960
You know what?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.330
Let's get out of here.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.330
Hey, it's me.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.290
Yeah, Marisa's on board.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.290
Doesn't suspect a thing.

16:15.330 --> 16:18.460
I can't believe you. I was the one
who was interested in Monique

16:18.460 --> 16:21.210
and now, all of a sudden,
she's your best friend?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.750
I went through
a lot of trouble--

16:22.750 --> 16:24.500
Into deceiving her
into thinking

16:24.500 --> 16:25.880
there was a party here?

16:25.880 --> 16:28.380
There was a party.
A party of two.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.120
Until you came in
and hypnotized her

16:32.120 --> 16:35.290
with your
Boutros Boutros-Ghali talk.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.880
You stole her
from me.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.420
If I could steal her,

16:39.420 --> 16:40.880
she probably wasn't
yours to begin with.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.290
You know what?

16:43.290 --> 16:45.540
I've noticed a disturbing
pattern with you, KC.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.380
First, you don't
listen to people.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.420
Then you dump on 'em.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.960
And finally,
you alienate 'em.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.380
You did it to me,
you did it to Marisa,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.750
and then you did it
to Monique.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.460
Okay, that is not true. Monique and
I had a great time last night.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.000
- You tried to turn her into Marisa.
- I did not.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You asked her
to dye her hair blonde.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.540
As a style choice.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.170
I thought it would make
her blue eyes pop.

17:06.170 --> 17:09.210
Marisa's eyes are blue.
Monique's are brown.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.540
Uh, not if she wore
the contacts I gave her.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.920
Okay, I'm being ridiculous.
I'm sorry.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.580
Okay, I just...

17:17.580 --> 17:20.170
I miss my best friend,

17:20.170 --> 17:24.330
and I know it's no excuse,
so I'm sorry, Ernie.

17:24.330 --> 17:25.670
Don't apologize to me.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.670
I'm your brother.

17:27.670 --> 17:29.540
I'm stuck with you.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.080
It's Monique you should
be apologizing to.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.330
While you're at it,
put in a good word for me.

17:34.330 --> 17:35.750
It's not too late
to turn this thing around.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.750
Yeah, you're right.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.080
I'll apologize to her on Friday
when I hang out with her.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.790
No, I want to hang
out with her on Friday.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.880
Sorry, just girls only.
Me and Marisa.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.290
Her name's Monique.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.330
I knew that.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.960
Here's the deal, Marisa.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.290
You're gonna make up with KC,
and you're gonna do it today.

17:55.290 --> 17:58.120
- That's right. Today.
- Why do you even care?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.830
Because she's trying
to steal my girl,

17:59.830 --> 18:01.620
and it has to stop.
Got it?

18:01.620 --> 18:04.380
Never gonna happen.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.580
So what I'm hearing is,
you'll think it over?

18:06.580 --> 18:10.330
No, what you're hearing is,
never gonna happen.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.790
Great. So you'll get back
to me in a couple of days

18:12.790 --> 18:15.000
with your
definitive answer?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.880
I am done with KC.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.670
I'm never gonna
have a girlfriend.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.290
Hey.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.170
I got your
first assignment.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.790
Oh, I'm ready.
Just name it.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.540
You're going to be
best friends with KC again.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.500
Can't I do something
more pleasant,

18:32.500 --> 18:35.210
like take a math test
or rip up my own fingernails?

18:35.210 --> 18:37.170
Marisa...

18:37.170 --> 18:39.750
we think that KC
might be giving intel

18:39.750 --> 18:41.290
to the Other Side.

18:41.290 --> 18:44.210
Your mission is to regain her
trust and get her to talk.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.120
Are you sure?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.750
KC never does
anything wrong.

18:47.750 --> 18:51.290
Well, she negotiated with
the head of the Other Side

18:51.290 --> 18:54.120
- behind our back.
- She did.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.330
And stole a helicopter.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.830
She did.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.330
Oh, and she told you
that she was a spy,

18:58.330 --> 18:59.920
and didn't
memory spray you.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.710
She did...
and she didn't.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.670
Anyway...

19:04.670 --> 19:07.460
we don't know for sure if the
Other Side has turned her.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.960
That's why we need you to make up with
her and find out anything you can.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.830
Mission accomplished.

19:12.830 --> 19:15.290
Wait, I say that
when I'm done, right?

19:15.290 --> 19:17.040
I'm still learning
the lingo.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.210
ANNOUNCER:
Coming up after the break,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.000
Lulu introduces her top choices
for her Prince Charming

19:32.000 --> 19:33.460
to her bestie Cassandra.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.000
Will Cassandra approve?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.420
Who cares what
Cassandra thinks?

19:38.420 --> 19:39.880
She may be your friend
now, Lulu,

19:39.880 --> 19:41.460
but the second you say
one wrong thing to her,

19:41.460 --> 19:43.170
she'll never
talk to you again,

19:43.170 --> 19:45.880
and you wind up being alone,
yelling at the TV.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.670
- So what are we watching?
- Hey, Marisa.

19:50.670 --> 19:53.460
Marisa!
Hey! Hey, you're here.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.500
And you're talking to me.
Wait, are we making up?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.420
- Please tell me we're making up.
- We're making up.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.460
You're welcome.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.830
Marisa, I am so sorry.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.460
Honestly, you're
my best friend,

20:06.460 --> 20:07.500
and I never meant
to hurt your feelings.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.920
No, it was
all my fault.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.750
I thought about
what you said.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.380
Like I was actually gonna
ever be in the Organization.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.460
I mean,
what was I thinking?

20:15.460 --> 20:17.880
I don't know
the first thing about spying.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.500
So let's hang out.
Catch up.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.290
You know what,
I would love to.

20:21.290 --> 20:24.460
- ( bracelet chimes )
- But it turns out I can't,

20:24.460 --> 20:26.670
'cause I have a last-minute
mission in Mexico,

20:26.670 --> 20:28.420
so I gotta go
pack my gear. Sorry.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.000
Oh, well,
let me help you,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.670
and you can tell me
all about it.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.380
Really?
You'd do that?

20:33.380 --> 20:35.920
- What are best friends for?
- Thanks.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.380
Rob, your name's on TV.
