00:02.097 --> 00:03.423
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.424 --> 00:04.596
An arena tour.

00:04.598 --> 00:06.987
You co-headlining with Juliette.

00:06.988 --> 00:08.438
I'm not saying "no."

00:10.125 --> 00:11.654
It's over, Gunnar.

00:11.708 --> 00:13.171
If that's not an affair,
then what is it, then?

00:13.172 --> 00:16.608
Peggy Kenter overdosed on
sleeping pills. She what?

00:16.609 --> 00:18.520
You had an affair with her, right? No.

00:18.521 --> 00:20.799
We want you to hit the road
with us when we head back out.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.226
Seriously? Full member.

00:22.227 --> 00:23.505
How long you gonna keep up

00:23.506 --> 00:26.024
this whole "no sex until marriage" thing?

00:26.025 --> 00:29.041
You, this family... don't
hold your breath, sweetie.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.651
Will you marry me?

All right. All right, good.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.389
Good, good, good. Is she
still not here yet?

01:06.390 --> 01:07.299
Nope.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.888
What? Which is why I think this
whole tour's a very bad idea.

01:10.889 --> 01:13.346
Look, Rayna, I'm really sorry.
She should be here any second.

01:13.347 --> 01:15.141
This is really not like her.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.254
Oh, Glenn, you're hilarious.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.955
Can you believe we just did that?

01:24.830 --> 01:26.744
It was definitely worth the wait.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.635
I meant getting married.

01:30.377 --> 01:34.355
Oh. Yeah, it was nice. Still is.

01:36.457 --> 01:38.082
We should probably tell people.

01:38.369 --> 01:39.690
Like our managers?

01:40.016 --> 01:41.978
I was talking about more like our parents.

01:44.705 --> 01:48.234
We could do that... or we can do this.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.175
What? What? What?

01:57.176 --> 02:00.403
Oh, no. I forgot.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.205
I have to endure Rayna James.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.264
I have to go to the recording studio.

02:04.385 --> 02:06.968
Can that wait? We just got married.

02:06.969 --> 02:09.203
As much as I would love
to put Rayna off now,

02:09.204 --> 02:11.548
the live version of the "Wrong
Song" just hit the charts,

02:11.549 --> 02:14.044
and the studio version's
gonna be a much bigger hit.

02:14.045 --> 02:16.953
You're so sexy when you talk business. Mmm.

02:32.717 --> 02:33.702
Yeah.

02:34.316 --> 02:35.863
Hey, it's just my opinion.

02:37.452 --> 02:38.178
Hell, if you don't like it...

02:38.179 --> 02:39.341
what are you doing?

02:39.748 --> 02:41.613
We're not getting anything done here, so...

02:42.548 --> 02:45.567
I'm gonna go home. Now Jeanne
said we needed three more songs,

02:45.568 --> 02:47.513
and we can't stop. We don't have anything.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.323
It's kinda hard to write a
song without any good lyrics.

02:51.891 --> 02:53.834
Would you mind telling me
why you're punishing me?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.210
All right, that's fine.

03:00.607 --> 03:01.396
Oh, so now you're gone?

03:01.397 --> 03:02.699
Yeah, I'm leaving. What
do you want me to do?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.469
I've gotta go meet Avery in the mornin'.

03:04.828 --> 03:06.838
So you two back together now, huh? No.

03:07.085 --> 03:08.885
Actually, he's giving me
the keys and moving out

03:08.886 --> 03:10.496
so I can have the place.

03:11.622 --> 03:13.431
All right. Hey, when are
we gonna write again?

03:13.432 --> 03:15.122
When would you like to write again?

03:15.128 --> 03:15.940
You need a couple of days,

03:15.941 --> 03:17.504
or you just wanna do it yourself?

03:20.230 --> 03:21.488
Excuse you.

03:35.653 --> 03:37.876
Man, you throw this kind
of party every night?

03:37.877 --> 03:41.235
Ain't nothing wrong with mixing a
little business with pleasure.

03:41.236 --> 03:42.414
Works for me.

03:42.757 --> 03:45.295
Speaking of business, you
spoke to the boys back home?

03:45.296 --> 03:46.175
Not yet.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.709
I thought we agreed on the terms.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.001
I can't exactly fire them over the phone.

03:50.002 --> 03:51.857
I mean, I grew up playing with these guys.

03:51.858 --> 03:55.024
You call that bar band boy
back home and you tell him

03:55.025 --> 03:56.817
you're moving up to the big times.

03:56.818 --> 03:58.856
All right, well, I'm... I'm
headed back tomorrow,

03:58.857 --> 04:00.419
so I'll tell 'em.

04:00.504 --> 04:03.198
You know, I'm supposed to
play one last gig with 'em.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.064
You know, I owe 'em that much.

04:05.065 --> 04:06.227
From now on,

04:06.871 --> 04:08.737
you don't owe nobody nothin'...

04:10.201 --> 04:11.362
But me.

04:16.076 --> 04:17.370
All right, I'm out.

04:17.370 --> 04:20.601
It's one thing for rock stars
to flake on recording sessions,

04:20.603 --> 04:23.830
but it's another for spoiled pop tarts.

04:24.429 --> 04:26.536
Just call me when she gets
here, all right? Okay.

04:27.710 --> 04:29.289
So what's happening with the tour, y'all?

04:29.290 --> 04:30.764
Are we lining up the dates?

04:30.765 --> 04:32.196
Considering we're turning on this tour

04:32.197 --> 04:34.820
 faster than anybody in this
business ever has, it's great.

04:34.821 --> 04:36.212
We gonna start a secondary market's town
that are dying

04:37.165 --> 04:39.094
for a Rayna james/ Juliette Barnes concert.

04:39.095 --> 04:41.260
So we'll still sell out
while sound and lighting

04:41.261 --> 04:43.496
are working out the kinks,
then we'll hit the majors.

04:43.497 --> 04:45.679
So wheels up would be when? Uh, Sunday.

04:46.087 --> 04:47.766
That gives us three days
of full tech rehearsal

04:47.767 --> 04:50.192
in the arena. I know that's fast, but...

04:50.193 --> 04:52.074
No, that's good.

04:57.853 --> 05:00.580
Deac, Deac, during your
lead on "need me" tonight,

05:00.581 --> 05:02.420
rock with me, man. Put on a show.

05:02.421 --> 05:03.488
I thought I was.

05:03.489 --> 05:05.516
Well, more. Perform, you know? Bring it.

05:05.517 --> 05:07.216
You want me to jump around and make faces?

05:07.217 --> 05:09.708
No, man, all I'm saying is
this ain't Rayna James, man.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.071
This is rock 'n' roll. All right.

05:11.072 --> 05:15.388
Guys, guys, this is Carmen
Gonzalez from "Tremelo" magazine.

05:15.389 --> 05:17.596
She's writing a cover story on...

05:18.833 --> 05:20.559
You know, the new version of the band.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.608
Why don't reporters kiss me like that?

05:22.609 --> 05:23.921
You look good. So do you.

05:23.922 --> 05:24.879
Obviously doing good.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.794
I'm looking forward to
that in depth interview.

05:26.795 --> 05:28.194
Oh, you don't want me. Talk to these guys.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.077
These are the real names.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.534
That's right we're the real names.

05:30.535 --> 05:32.689
Are you ready for round three of...

05:32.940 --> 05:34.960
Guess what? So are you now.

05:34.961 --> 05:40.011
Let me hear you make some
noise for the revel kings!

05:42.656 --> 05:43.818
Hey, y'all.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.465
Where you been?

05:47.392 --> 05:48.714
Getting married.

05:50.513 --> 05:52.048
When the hell did you do that?

05:52.049 --> 05:53.760
I told you, just now.

05:53.761 --> 05:55.610
Y'all should communicate better.

05:55.745 --> 05:58.828
You... are you out of your mind?
Did you at least get a prenup?

05:58.829 --> 06:00.998
Glenn, do I look like an idiot?

06:01.276 --> 06:02.888
Can we just get this
song over with, please?

06:02.889 --> 06:05.189
I've got a hot husband at
home and a honeymoon to plan.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.528
Hey, fellas.

06:07.015 --> 06:10.224
Can I talk to the beautiful
bride alone for a second?

06:10.822 --> 06:11.856
Yeah.

06:17.223 --> 06:19.216
Guess congratulations are in order.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.336
Nice ring.

06:22.663 --> 06:23.872
Well, thank you.

06:24.070 --> 06:25.984
But you're not here to talk about my ring.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.156
No, I wanna start the tour on Sunday.

06:28.498 --> 06:29.851
Are you kiddin'?

06:30.003 --> 06:31.237
Mnh-mnh. Wait.

06:31.238 --> 06:34.318
Why do you even wanna
go out on tour with me?

06:34.536 --> 06:35.614
You hate me.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.404
I only hate sunburns and hangovers.

06:37.405 --> 06:38.763
This is just business.

06:38.764 --> 06:40.328
Everything okay at home?

06:41.324 --> 06:42.966
Well...

06:43.276 --> 06:45.084
Marriage is complicated.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.524
I heard your husband's
campaign's gotten pretty ugly.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.343
Oh, follow politics, do you?

06:49.396 --> 06:50.927
Just the scandals.

06:50.997 --> 06:53.534
Right. And you would know
something about that.

06:54.356 --> 06:55.492
Yeah, seems to me

06:55.493 --> 06:58.943
you need me right now every bit
as much as I might need you.

07:01.541 --> 07:02.927
You in?

07:07.553 --> 07:09.163
Honey, I'm home!

07:11.889 --> 07:12.939
I told 'em.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.347
I can see that.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.903
So should I call you "mom" and "dad"?

07:18.904 --> 07:20.646
Have you talked this
through with your coaches?

07:20.647 --> 07:23.661
 because you clearly didn't see
the need to discuss it with us.

07:23.662 --> 07:26.331
 I'm sorry, but we just
got married, not y'all.

07:26.332 --> 07:29.143
Forgive me, miss, but we don't
even know you... at all.

07:29.998 --> 07:32.645
Son, you need to stop and you
need to think this through.

07:32.646 --> 07:34.868
It's done, and it was our choice.

07:34.869 --> 07:35.920
He's right,

07:36.742 --> 07:38.709
and we have to respect their decision, Brock.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.800
But you have got to respect this family.

07:40.966 --> 07:43.788
Before word of this crazy
elopement gets out,

07:43.789 --> 07:45.590
I want this marriage done right.

07:45.597 --> 07:48.326
It's legal. Done right in the eyes of God.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.865
No son of mine's getting
married at some courthouse

07:50.866 --> 07:52.252
and calling it done.

07:53.059 --> 07:54.261
We have an actual ceremony.

07:54.262 --> 07:57.294
Uh, we... we can do that. Right, honey?

07:58.195 --> 07:58.948
Of course.

07:58.949 --> 08:01.340
This month, then. Given the circumstances,

08:01.341 --> 08:03.433
it'll be just family and close friends.

08:04.013 --> 08:04.957
I'm on the church board,

08:04.958 --> 08:06.772
so I can arrange to have it happen quickly.

08:06.773 --> 08:08.786
Um, I can't do that, actually.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.184
I have to go on tour on Sunday. What?

08:11.185 --> 08:12.847
With Rayna James. It just happened.

08:12.848 --> 08:14.395
Well, then we'll make it on Saturday.

08:14.769 --> 08:16.338
Does that work with your busy schedule?

08:16.339 --> 08:17.374
Yes.

08:17.827 --> 08:20.524
I've always wanted a big church wedding.

08:26.779 --> 08:29.088
I don't understand. I thought
you were working on an album.

08:29.089 --> 08:32.253
Well, that was the plan,
but "wrong song" is just,

08:32.323 --> 08:33.660
you know, chartin' out of the blue,

08:33.662 --> 08:35.740
and everybody thinks we
should run with that

08:35.741 --> 08:38.897
and, you know, you and I still need money.

08:38.898 --> 08:41.082
Yeah. So... so Sunday.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.183
Yeah. For how long?

08:43.184 --> 08:46.116
Um, you know, U.S. leg,
all told, in and out,

08:46.117 --> 08:48.047
probably about five months.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.778
So you're just gonna
pack up for five months

08:51.779 --> 08:53.098
and leave the family.

08:53.249 --> 08:54.463
I'm not, uh...

08:54.464 --> 08:56.250
I'm... I'm, uh...

08:56.432 --> 08:58.538
I'm gonna take the girls with me this time.

08:59.376 --> 09:00.762
Rayna, that's crazy.

09:01.136 --> 09:02.403
I mean, come on. The girls are in school.

09:02.404 --> 09:03.881
The election's around the corner.

09:03.882 --> 09:04.563
You're not taking them away.

09:04.564 --> 09:06.051
Well, I feel like I need to take 'em away

09:06.052 --> 09:09.528
from a toxic environment, from
a family that I don't trust,

09:09.529 --> 09:11.981
and I'm sorry to say, Teddy,
but that includes you.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.237
Okay, look, well, I'm sorry,

09:13.238 --> 09:15.172
but you can't make a
decision like that alone.

09:15.173 --> 09:17.440
You stole money. You lied to me about it.

09:17.441 --> 09:18.599
There is a woman in the hospital

09:18.600 --> 09:20.365
who tried to commit suicide over it.

09:20.366 --> 09:21.813
So, yeah, I do think I
can make that decision.

09:21.814 --> 09:22.354
Let me tell you something.

09:22.355 --> 09:24.260
You are not taking the girls away from me,

09:24.261 --> 09:26.015
not without a fight. You hear me?

09:50.175 --> 09:51.356
Is this too flashy?

09:51.357 --> 09:53.656
I don't think I've ever heard
you ask that question before.

09:53.657 --> 09:55.080
Well, we've got a game in Cleveland,

09:55.081 --> 09:56.760
then one in green bay, then I'm back here.

09:56.761 --> 09:58.368
All right, so Cleveland's a maybe.

09:58.369 --> 10:01.515
Oh! Juliette has to be
in Dallas the next day.

10:01.746 --> 10:04.256
Great. Two nights with
my wife in two months.

10:04.257 --> 10:06.552
Just the honeymoon I was hoping for.
I'm sorry.

10:06.553 --> 10:08.739
Can you guys give us a minute, please?

10:17.464 --> 10:18.312
What's wrong?

10:18.313 --> 10:20.455
No, I just wish you
would've discussed all this

10:20.456 --> 10:21.858
with me beforehand.

10:22.662 --> 10:25.781
You don't discuss every detail
of your football career with me.

10:25.782 --> 10:27.296
This is my job. Yeah, you're right.

10:27.297 --> 10:29.215
I just, you know, I think
we should talk about it.

10:29.216 --> 10:31.732
That's what normal married people do.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.773
Talk about arena tours
and football careers?

10:34.774 --> 10:36.688
Come on, babe. You know what I mean.

10:37.657 --> 10:39.828
You know what I think we should talk about?

10:45.802 --> 10:48.441
No. That's not really talking.

10:48.442 --> 10:50.820
Mmm. Seriously.

10:51.289 --> 10:53.058
What are we gonna do when you're on tour?

10:53.114 --> 10:55.459
We're gonna just hook up when we can,

10:55.460 --> 10:59.502
and... sex in between, and we'll be fine.

11:01.012 --> 11:03.662
In the meantime, you can get out so that...

11:04.020 --> 11:05.354
I can try on some wedding dresses.

11:05.355 --> 11:06.790
Mm. Okay.

11:08.530 --> 11:09.805
I'll see you in a bit.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.415
New polls show Coleman
only got a slight bump

11:23.416 --> 11:25.218
from the release of those photos.

11:28.968 --> 11:30.594
Hey. Take a seat.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.312
I went to see Peggy.

11:34.313 --> 11:35.879
Hey. Yeah? How is she?

11:35.880 --> 11:39.697
She's gonna be fine. Her
husband was with her.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.779
It's within reach, Teddy.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.683
Yeah, but for what?

11:46.824 --> 11:48.275
I mean, she almost died.

11:49.768 --> 11:52.151
And now my old friend
Coleman's become an enemy.

11:52.152 --> 11:54.725
It's politics, and when you win,

11:55.224 --> 11:56.695
you're gonna repair those relationships...

11:56.696 --> 11:57.937
Rayna's leaving.

11:58.712 --> 11:59.671
What?

11:59.672 --> 12:03.202
She's going on tour, and she's, uh...

12:04.456 --> 12:06.635
She said that she wants to
take the girls with her.

12:06.713 --> 12:07.512
When?

12:07.513 --> 12:08.563
Sunday.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.953
Well, she can't do that. Not now.

12:10.954 --> 12:12.739
It's too close to the election.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.707
I know.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.271
But to tell you the truth, Tandy,

12:18.272 --> 12:20.827
I'm not even sure I
should try and stop her.

12:29.601 --> 12:30.871
Hey, darlin'. Yeah?

12:30.872 --> 12:32.387
Why don't you sit up here?

12:32.713 --> 12:33.918
Seats are all taken, Cy.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.177
Not this one.

12:40.575 --> 12:41.592
Really?

12:43.695 --> 12:46.148
Now you're gonna get much better
stories out of him than me.

12:46.149 --> 12:47.488
I mean, they're not true, but they're good.

12:47.489 --> 12:49.124
You know, I don't care about his stories.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.311
I care about yours.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.035
You're in a whole bunch of 'em, right?

12:52.185 --> 12:53.695
I mean, the parts I remember, at least.

12:53.696 --> 12:56.218
Yeah, well, I'm just glad that
you're alive to tell 'em,

12:56.559 --> 12:58.648
especially after what happened to Vince.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.248
Yeah.

13:00.974 --> 13:03.493
Can I ask you something? You're gonna.

13:03.494 --> 13:05.017
Why don't you ever just settle down

13:05.018 --> 13:07.701
and get fat and happy?

13:08.892 --> 13:09.960
This part of the interview?

13:09.961 --> 13:12.098
No. This is me being nosey.

13:12.099 --> 13:13.711
Oh, okay. Well...

13:14.756 --> 13:15.723
I don't know, you know?

13:15.724 --> 13:18.506
Maybe I just never found the right one.

13:18.507 --> 13:19.783
At the right time.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.429
Yeah.

13:22.396 --> 13:24.055
Even if I had, you know,

13:24.301 --> 13:28.022
me and happy... we don't
get along too good.

13:28.161 --> 13:29.659
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.743
Remember that? A little bit.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.776
Oh, you're really gonna do it?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.787
Mm, so...

13:41.737 --> 13:42.677
What's it like joining one

13:42.678 --> 13:44.975
of the biggest rock 'n'
roll bands in the world?

13:45.653 --> 13:46.784
Loud.

It's gonna kill it.

14:00.470 --> 14:01.502
You think?

14:04.516 --> 14:05.854
Well, you know...

14:06.372 --> 14:08.032
I've been doing this a long time.

14:08.085 --> 14:10.637
I know when it's time to
get back out on the road.

14:10.638 --> 14:12.973
But you beat down my door to do an album.

14:12.974 --> 14:15.912
I know. I really wanna do it.

14:15.997 --> 14:17.576
So why are you doing this?

14:19.661 --> 14:22.728
My marriage. My family.

14:24.606 --> 14:26.056
It's a mess.

14:26.911 --> 14:29.491
No, I-I, uh, I wanna do our album,

14:29.492 --> 14:32.511
but I've got to get out of Nashville.

14:37.172 --> 14:39.583
If I don't, I just don't know what's...

14:46.675 --> 14:48.027
Yeah. There he is.

14:48.028 --> 14:50.500
Talk to me. Don't. Seriously. Don't.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.622
You deserve this, brother.

14:53.097 --> 14:55.683
I can't believe you actually
came home with a deal.

14:56.113 --> 14:57.627
When we moving to Atlanta?

14:57.966 --> 14:59.015
We're not.

15:00.157 --> 15:03.114
Dominic wants to sign me as a solo artist.

15:03.997 --> 15:05.991
What'd he say when you
told him to screw off?

15:07.725 --> 15:08.663
I didn't.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.437
Dude, we made a vow that none of us

15:12.438 --> 15:14.066
would ever screw each other like this.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.997
We were kids when we said that.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.783
Now what'd you guys expect me to do?

15:17.784 --> 15:20.087
I can't say no to this. It's the real deal.

15:20.088 --> 15:21.844
And we're not? That's not what I'm saying.

15:21.845 --> 15:23.725
Look, there's nothing I can
say to make this better.

15:23.726 --> 15:24.903
I just wanna end right.

15:24.904 --> 15:27.227
I wanna play the last show
with you guys and go out with a bang.

15:39.565 --> 15:40.928
You know what? I'm all about the music.

15:40.929 --> 15:41.611
You know that.

15:41.612 --> 15:43.599
I know that you're all about Avery Barkley,

15:43.600 --> 15:45.880
because you sure as hell
aren't about your friends.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.225
Good luck in Atlanta... douche.

15:53.181 --> 15:54.742
Come on. I hate that guy.

16:11.697 --> 16:13.467
If you've got something
more important going on,

16:13.468 --> 16:15.095
I'm happy to wait.

16:15.181 --> 16:19.255
No. No, just dealing with tour details.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.163
It's nothin' as more
important as my weddin'.

16:21.164 --> 16:23.639
She just inquired where the
wedding party should sit.

16:23.996 --> 16:26.540
Sean's cousin Bradley will be his best man.

16:26.541 --> 16:27.878
They're very close.

16:28.013 --> 16:30.151
Uh, who is in your bridal party?

16:31.053 --> 16:33.215
I thought I would ask your Dana

16:33.216 --> 16:35.376
to be one of my junior bridesmaids,

16:35.377 --> 16:37.700
and then my friend Emily is
gonna be the maid of honor.

16:37.701 --> 16:39.566
Well, I thought she was your assistant.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.526
Yes. But we're very close.

16:43.012 --> 16:45.596
And my manager Glenn is gonna
walk me down the aisle.

16:45.597 --> 16:46.843
Not your mother?

16:46.844 --> 16:49.004
Ah. She unfortunately can't make it,

16:49.005 --> 16:50.572
it being last minute and all.

16:50.573 --> 16:52.853
I'm sure those rehab
facilities are quite strict

16:52.854 --> 16:54.231
with patients leaving.

16:54.262 --> 16:55.899
Was she excited when you told her?

16:55.900 --> 16:58.131
I haven't gotten the
chance to tell her yet.

16:58.132 --> 17:00.887
Really? Don't you want her to meet the man

17:00.888 --> 17:02.839
that you're gonna spend the
rest of your life with?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.355
Of course I do.

17:05.575 --> 17:07.030
Yeah, I guess you were wrong about me

17:07.031 --> 17:08.751
never being a part of your family.

17:08.752 --> 17:12.242
Oh, honey, eloping with my
son is not the same thing.

17:12.776 --> 17:15.570
I expect a lot from Sean's wife.

17:15.977 --> 17:17.395
You know what they say.

17:17.608 --> 17:18.993
You don't marry the man.

17:19.241 --> 17:20.674
You marry the family.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.419
What are y'all doing here? Rayna.

17:32.454 --> 17:34.278
You going on tour right now is bad enough,

17:34.279 --> 17:36.739
but taking your children
is beyond the pale.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.135
Oh, my God.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.656
You talked to Teddy.

17:41.657 --> 17:44.252
He was upset. We're all upset.

17:44.253 --> 17:46.551
You can't yank those girls out of school.

17:46.552 --> 17:48.152
What kind of parent does that?

17:48.153 --> 17:49.816
You talking to me about parenting?

17:49.817 --> 17:51.645
Okay, look, I-I made my mistakes,

17:51.646 --> 17:54.095
but I would never, never
have left your mother alone

17:54.096 --> 17:54.915
in a situation...

17:54.916 --> 17:56.516
don't you bring my mother into this.

17:56.517 --> 17:58.909
Don't be foolish enough
to consider divorce.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.271
Custody battles always seem to

18:02.357 --> 18:04.376
shine a light on the issues of paternity,

18:04.377 --> 18:07.343
and it would be a shame
if Maddie were to learn

18:07.344 --> 18:09.291
the truth about her real father.

18:12.689 --> 18:14.187
Get out of my house.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.330
I'm trying to save your family.

18:16.331 --> 18:18.196
Get out of my house.

18:18.378 --> 18:19.651
Both of you.

18:21.338 --> 18:22.868
Right now.

18:39.242 --> 18:40.632
I guess it was a good thing

18:40.633 --> 18:42.945
I never got around to changing the locks.

18:43.114 --> 18:44.708
I packed your stuff up.

18:45.081 --> 18:48.344
I see that. I noticed
you, uh, moved the couch

18:48.345 --> 18:49.876
to where you always wanted it.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.677
I actually think it looks better there.

18:55.993 --> 18:57.492
So you gonna get a roommate?

18:57.769 --> 18:59.780
No, I'd rather be alone at this point.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.324
Look, Scarlett...

19:03.865 --> 19:05.331
If I could take back what I did...

19:05.332 --> 19:08.243
doesn't matter. Well,
if we hadn't broken up,

19:08.244 --> 19:09.870
you never would've gotten the deal.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.022
And I definitely wouldn't
be doing all the music

19:12.023 --> 19:15.168
that I'm doing and... probably
just would've ended up.

19:15.366 --> 19:17.121
Mrs. Avery Barkley.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.400
Still has a nice ring to it.

19:21.209 --> 19:23.891
Well, I'm sure your future
wife will really enjoy it.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.466
Well, I guess I should get goin'.

19:33.057 --> 19:34.551
Can I get a hug, at least?

19:51.933 --> 19:53.128
I swear...

19:53.965 --> 19:55.255
I look at you...

19:57.664 --> 19:59.383
And I'm still ruined.

20:02.728 --> 20:04.129
Avery...

20:17.810 --> 20:19.857
So, Deac, last night on "need me"...

20:19.858 --> 20:22.095
Oh. Yeah. I'll try to
step it up there for you.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.774
Oh, you did. Thing is, I
felt a little stepped on.

20:25.408 --> 20:26.328
Yeah?

20:26.329 --> 20:28.826
Yeah. You dragged that lead
out a little too long.

20:29.222 --> 20:31.671
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to find that happy medium.

20:31.672 --> 20:33.823
That's why I brought it up, so you will.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.444
Okay, we're ready.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.572
You know what? I'm good. Thank you. Okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.734
Whoa, look at you.

20:41.735 --> 20:43.154
Can't stand all this primpin'.

20:43.155 --> 20:44.559
Makes me agitated.

20:44.627 --> 20:47.685
Yeah? Is it that, or is
it this big Rayna tour?

20:49.051 --> 20:50.255
What?

20:51.581 --> 20:53.892
She's going out with Juliette Barnes.

20:54.438 --> 20:55.913
Are you kidding me?

20:55.992 --> 20:57.799
Co-headlining arenas.

20:58.787 --> 21:00.054
Damn.

21:00.678 --> 21:02.595
Who's she got playing guitar for her?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.140
Who, Rayna? Yeah.

21:04.454 --> 21:05.808
Does it matter?

21:05.844 --> 21:07.547
No. Just curious.

21:07.752 --> 21:10.784
Deacon, right up here in the middle.
I'm good right here.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.008
How you doin'? Guys, take five.

22:01.009 --> 22:02.215
All right.

22:02.229 --> 22:03.775
So I have great news.

22:03.776 --> 22:06.670
Ah, you found another city
where our schedules overlap?

22:06.671 --> 22:09.467
Uh... no. I talked to your
mom's drug counselor,

22:09.468 --> 22:11.514
and there's a family day tomorrow,

22:11.515 --> 22:13.830
so we're scheduled to visit around 11:00.

22:13.831 --> 22:16.261
Wait. You... called my mom's rehab?

22:16.262 --> 22:18.565
Yeah. I thought you wanted me to meet her.

22:18.566 --> 22:20.123
Isn't that what you told
my mom this morning

22:20.124 --> 22:21.745
when you were at the wedding planner?

22:23.111 --> 22:27.184
Ah, that was... so sweet
of you to do, babe.

22:27.573 --> 22:28.624
Yeah. Um...

22:28.625 --> 22:31.734
I just... my mom and I have a
very complicated relationship.

22:31.735 --> 22:36.839
I just feel like maybe I
should go alone first.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.550
You sure you don't want
me to drive you? Yeah.

22:38.551 --> 22:41.232
I can get there on my own. Okay.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.852
The song is awesome.

22:42.853 --> 22:44.183
Thank ya.

22:47.573 --> 22:50.460
That was... never our issue.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.481
Uh... I gotta get goin'.

23:03.528 --> 23:06.242
Dominic wants me back in the studio today.

23:07.091 --> 23:08.693
Hey, you wanna come with me?

23:08.863 --> 23:09.905
To Atlanta?

23:09.906 --> 23:10.943
Yeah.

23:12.004 --> 23:14.406
I don't think so. Um...

23:15.188 --> 23:17.018
But J.T. And the boys
must be over the moon...

23:17.019 --> 23:18.461
big record deal and all.

23:20.427 --> 23:21.602
Uh...

23:22.052 --> 23:23.302
Actually...

23:24.394 --> 23:26.068
I'm going it alone.

23:26.482 --> 23:28.253
Not because I wanted to.

23:28.516 --> 23:30.155
But Dominic...

23:30.252 --> 23:31.762
Wait. You...

23:32.826 --> 23:34.195
You fired J.T.?

23:34.196 --> 23:37.230
I had to let 'em go. There's a difference.

23:38.427 --> 23:40.033
Only to you.

23:41.381 --> 23:44.675
I-I cannot believe I let myself
forget how selfish you are.

23:44.897 --> 23:46.873
There's something else I forgot about you.

23:47.767 --> 23:49.740
You hurt people...

23:50.007 --> 23:52.218
people who do not deserve to be hurt.

23:53.488 --> 23:55.795
You leave your keys, and you ge.

24:12.988 --> 24:14.039
Hey.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.071
Hey.

24:16.053 --> 24:17.796
Brought you some coffee.

24:19.431 --> 24:20.682
Thanks.

24:21.309 --> 24:23.074
You look really good, mama.

24:23.858 --> 24:25.345
Oh. Working really hard.

24:26.346 --> 24:27.945
It's so good to see you.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.226
It reminds me what I'm working so hard for.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.857
Did you read my letter?

24:32.189 --> 24:35.503
Uh... it's actually not what
I'm here to talk about.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.897
I have some good news.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.207
I'm getting married.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.139
His name's Sean. Sean Butler.

24:44.140 --> 24:45.787
He's a football player.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.257
He's an amazing guy, and, uh,

24:48.407 --> 24:51.388
we're having a big church
wedding this Saturday,

24:51.389 --> 24:53.363
just like we always used to talk about.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.982
Why are you not excited for me?

24:57.983 --> 24:59.396
It's not right.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.921
You don't even know Sean.

25:00.922 --> 25:04.194
This isn't about Sean, honey.
It's about you.

25:04.195 --> 25:06.266
Baby, you got a hole so deep inside of you,

25:06.267 --> 25:09.429
and I know that because I've got
the same hole inside of me,

25:09.430 --> 25:11.825
and you think that saying
some vows to somebody

25:11.826 --> 25:14.071
you hardly know is gonna fill that up?

25:14.072 --> 25:15.982
I am nothing like you.

25:16.727 --> 25:20.049
Baby, no amount of marrying
is gonna quiet your demons.

25:20.505 --> 25:22.696
Just because they preach that you in rehab

25:22.697 --> 25:24.863
doesn't mean you have to
preach it at me, okay?

25:24.864 --> 25:26.316
I'm getting married,

25:26.735 --> 25:28.791
and I'm gonna have a real family.

25:28.925 --> 25:30.545
You don't care about me.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.867
You just can't stand to see me happy.

25:34.721 --> 25:36.246
And are you?

25:47.185 --> 25:48.560
Hey. Hey.

25:48.783 --> 25:49.847
How are you?

25:49.848 --> 25:51.270
I've been better. How are you?

25:51.352 --> 25:52.760
Yeah. Oh, yeah. How you doing?

25:52.761 --> 25:54.330
I'm all right. Yeah.

25:54.331 --> 25:56.229
You left your strap at the house.

25:56.230 --> 25:58.415
Oh. He probably didn't have the guts

25:58.416 --> 26:00.501
to bring it by himself
after I went off on him.

26:00.502 --> 26:03.466
Yeah, I'm sorry he's such a jerk.

26:03.467 --> 26:07.106
Me, too. We should start a
club, call it "Avery's exes."

26:07.299 --> 26:08.701
Great name for a band.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.381
It's kinda catchy. Mm-hmm.

26:10.382 --> 26:11.618
'Cause I don't think we'll be going by

26:11.619 --> 26:13.410
"the Avery Barkley band"
anymore, that's for sure.

26:13.411 --> 26:15.795
Yeah, well, I'm glad you guys
are going on. Hell, yeah.

26:15.856 --> 26:17.043
Unlike Mr. rock star,

26:17.044 --> 26:19.267
we actually like playing
for beer and pizza.

26:19.268 --> 26:21.384
We just gotta cancel the show tonight,

26:21.404 --> 26:22.948
start the singer search, and, uh...

26:22.949 --> 26:24.949
what if you found somebody
really last minute?

26:26.863 --> 26:30.097
I know this blonde singer girl.
She knows all your songs.

26:30.894 --> 26:32.656
You don't wanna do that, do you?

26:32.789 --> 26:35.395
Yeah. I don't want you to cancel the show.

26:35.396 --> 26:38.082
Oh, man. Let's do it. Absolutely.

26:40.703 --> 26:43.109
♪"Keep on going till you're gone♪

26:43.863 --> 26:47.071

26:51.236 --> 26:52.813

26:56.640 --> 26:58.093
We should talk.

26:58.888 --> 27:00.066
You're right.

27:02.452 --> 27:03.663
I'm sorry about...

27:03.664 --> 27:06.261
not... about that.

27:06.545 --> 27:07.894
I wanna get promoted,

27:07.895 --> 27:10.974
and I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to make that happen,

27:10.975 --> 27:14.101
including patching things
up with you and Scarlett.

27:14.102 --> 27:15.026
We're fine.

27:15.365 --> 27:16.921
Everybody's talking about
what's going on with you.

27:16.922 --> 27:18.441
Even Jeanne asked me about it.

27:18.442 --> 27:20.541
I was writing my own songs for three years,

27:20.542 --> 27:24.282
churning out stuff I liked.
I can get that back.

27:24.283 --> 27:26.286
Not to question your musical genius,

27:26.287 --> 27:28.321
but... you and Scarlett...

27:28.589 --> 27:31.384
Ironic as it may be coming from me,

27:31.710 --> 27:34.101
you're better together than you are apart.

27:38.778 --> 27:41.201
Well, it's still looking pretty tied to me.

27:46.487 --> 27:48.459
Well, look at y'all, thick as thieves.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.193
Settle down, Rayna. I'm not
gonna settle down, daddy,

27:51.194 --> 27:52.675
'cause unlike everybody else around here,

27:52.676 --> 27:54.621
I don't do exactly what you tell me to do.

27:54.622 --> 27:56.445
Hey, wait a minute. What is this all about?

27:56.446 --> 27:57.685
Oh, he didn't tell you? He didn't tell you

27:57.686 --> 27:58.817
he and Tandy made a little visit

27:58.818 --> 28:00.474
over to the house for a
little intervention?

28:00.475 --> 28:01.944
I simply told her she had obligations

28:01.945 --> 28:03.634
to you and the family, that's all.

28:03.635 --> 28:05.504
That's all? "Oh, wouldn't it be a shame"

28:05.505 --> 28:08.164
if Maddie were to find out
who her real father is?"

28:08.601 --> 28:10.300
Son, listen to me. That is not...

28:10.301 --> 28:11.638
you listen to me.

28:11.836 --> 28:14.096
Now Maddie is my daughter,

28:14.097 --> 28:16.297
no matter who her biological father is.

28:16.298 --> 28:17.257
You mean, you knew that...

28:17.258 --> 28:18.471
of course I knew.

28:18.472 --> 28:21.415
If the time ever comes when we
need to tell her the truth,

28:21.416 --> 28:23.005
that's for us to decide, not you.

28:23.006 --> 28:23.867
And let me tell you something.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.809
You ever threaten to
destroy that bond again,

28:25.810 --> 28:28.718
I will come for you. You understand me?

28:33.912 --> 28:35.368
Unfortunately...

28:35.696 --> 28:38.230
Neither of you understand my intentions.

28:38.231 --> 28:41.575
Oh, I absolutely understand
your intentions.

29:01.347 --> 29:04.286
Deac, you killed it tonight, man.

29:04.287 --> 29:08.080
Yes, you sure did. I do believe
you found the happy medium.

29:08.081 --> 29:11.078
Now straight up, tell us, how
you doing with all this?

29:11.079 --> 29:14.437
It's good. Just getting used
to the volume of it all.

29:14.438 --> 29:16.221
Yeah, it's about to get
a lot louder, brother...

29:16.222 --> 29:18.717
South America, Australia, Asia.

29:18.718 --> 29:20.456
Hey. Hey, long road, baby.

29:20.457 --> 29:22.994
We just wanna make sure
you're into riding with us.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.588
Who else is gonna play with
you ugly bastards, huh?

29:26.588 --> 29:28.053
Just because you pulled the hot reporter

29:28.054 --> 29:30.060
does not mean you are
prettier than me. Ooh!

29:30.061 --> 29:31.254
He's right.

29:33.549 --> 29:34.825
You okay?

29:36.091 --> 29:39.741
Oh, yeah, just... head hurts a little bit?

29:40.809 --> 29:42.411
I'm gonna go back to the hotel.

29:43.511 --> 29:45.069
You want some company?

29:46.019 --> 29:47.843
You gonna bring that thing with you?

29:49.174 --> 29:51.730
I'm willing to hand it over
for something in return.

31:19.728 --> 31:20.656
Thank you.

31:20.657 --> 31:22.369
You wanna make it a permanent thing?

31:23.033 --> 31:24.459
Serious? Mm-hmm.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.635
Our crowd loved you.

31:25.636 --> 31:26.847
We know you can write great lyrics,

31:26.848 --> 31:29.084
and, hell, you already got
a publishing deal, right?

31:29.244 --> 31:30.300
Yeah, I do.

31:30.301 --> 31:33.133
So let's get some new songs
up and do this every night.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.024
Don't answer. Just think
about it, all right?

31:38.155 --> 31:39.324
All right?

31:44.311 --> 31:45.401
Hey.

31:46.667 --> 31:48.188
How'd it go with your mom?

31:49.720 --> 31:50.995
Good.

31:51.626 --> 31:53.394
She couldn't be happier.

31:54.276 --> 31:55.943
She gonna be able to come to the wedding?

31:55.944 --> 31:57.781
It'd be great to have the
whole family there together.

31:57.782 --> 31:59.260
Let's go somewhere.

31:59.549 --> 32:01.679
We don't have to go as far as South beach,

32:01.680 --> 32:03.749
but... New York?

32:03.750 --> 32:06.281
Are you serious? Babe, I
can't go up to New York.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.741
I gotta watch game tape tonight.

32:07.742 --> 32:09.478
I gotta meet the trainer at dawn.

32:12.019 --> 32:13.217
Come here.

32:18.299 --> 32:21.258
Now this is the way to watch game tape...

32:21.259 --> 32:23.386
snuggling with my wife.

32:25.321 --> 32:26.815
I love you.

32:28.622 --> 32:30.088
Me, too.

32:31.521 --> 32:34.518
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

32:34.519 --> 32:37.420
I told you I was gonna dirty you up, boy.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.197
Hey, you think maybe the
bass is a little too dirty?

32:40.198 --> 32:43.291
No. I think your ears ain't
used to that platinum sound,

32:43.292 --> 32:45.570
ya heard? Real talk.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.099
I let you down yet?

32:47.100 --> 32:48.982
No, man. Look, it sounds great,

32:48.983 --> 32:51.509
and I... it's just, I'm used to
something a little different,

32:51.510 --> 32:52.708
that's all.

33:24.970 --> 33:28.443
You were right. It's way
better than an interview.

33:31.827 --> 33:34.727
You know that we're gonna have
to do one eventually, right?

33:35.789 --> 33:37.044
Do we?

33:37.756 --> 33:38.538
Really?

33:38.539 --> 33:40.310
I know you hate talking about yourself.

33:40.344 --> 33:42.432
That's one of your more
endearing qualities.

33:42.433 --> 33:45.457
Oh. I have an endearing quality.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.924
That's good to know.

33:48.749 --> 33:50.191
Are you okay?

33:51.395 --> 33:55.497
Yeah. Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

33:56.575 --> 33:59.088
'Cause there's an edge
to your put-on charm.

34:01.510 --> 34:03.141
I know you too well.

34:06.055 --> 34:08.329
Maybe you should know me
well enough to let it go.

34:10.784 --> 34:14.312
I tried that once 14 years ago,

34:14.313 --> 34:17.563
and... I still regret it.

34:20.540 --> 34:23.344
Vince's car accident...

34:25.295 --> 34:27.496
When I left you guys, you
kept drinking, didn't you?

34:27.498 --> 34:28.869
What are you doin'?

34:30.205 --> 34:31.469
What?

34:32.108 --> 34:33.735
You're being a reporter.

34:34.217 --> 34:37.222
No, I'm being... I'm being a friend.

34:40.175 --> 34:42.072
I'm worried about you.

34:46.174 --> 34:47.413
Well...

34:47.789 --> 34:49.300
I appreciate it.

34:50.774 --> 34:51.824
Yeah?

34:51.824 --> 34:52.989
Yeah.

34:54.312 --> 34:56.079
Let me show you how much.

35:07.167 --> 35:08.652
Girls asleep yet?

35:08.957 --> 35:10.095
Yeah.

35:12.761 --> 35:14.468
Good night. Night.

35:14.524 --> 35:15.600
Hey.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.880
You know what you did yesterday,

35:19.881 --> 35:21.840
standing up to daddy about Maddie...

35:21.841 --> 35:24.264
oh, please, don't tell me you're surprised.

35:25.036 --> 35:26.233
No.

35:27.179 --> 35:28.616
I was grateful.

35:30.023 --> 35:32.667
And, you know, it got me
thinking about, um...

35:37.407 --> 35:39.844
Just all this, what we're doing.

35:39.988 --> 35:42.860
And I think we just need to
be honest with each other.

35:44.166 --> 35:46.362
'Cause I don't think this is
about what's been going on

35:46.363 --> 35:49.054
the last few weeks. I think
it's what's been going on

35:49.055 --> 35:50.711
the last few years.

35:54.264 --> 35:56.218
I, you know, I love you.

35:58.217 --> 35:59.952
I've always loved you.

36:04.047 --> 36:05.842
I just don't know that, um,

36:05.843 --> 36:07.634
I just don't know that I'm happy.

36:07.635 --> 36:09.673
I don't know that you're happy, either,

36:10.092 --> 36:12.242
if we're really being honest.

36:14.498 --> 36:16.261
But our girls love their parents,

36:16.262 --> 36:17.748
and they don't know
what's going on with us,

36:17.749 --> 36:19.553
and they don't know what's
going on in this marriage,

36:19.554 --> 36:21.831
and it... it needs to stay that way.

36:24.576 --> 36:25.877
As far as I'm concerned,

36:25.878 --> 36:29.778
all they need to know is that
mommy's going out on tour again,

36:29.779 --> 36:31.556
daddy's running for mayor.

36:33.206 --> 36:34.874
They'll come out on the road with me

36:34.875 --> 36:37.134
whenever their school schedule permits.

36:37.135 --> 36:40.071
Call each other on the phone.
We'll video chat.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.573
I'll come home whenever I can,

36:42.574 --> 36:45.687
just like we've done
hundreds of times before.

36:46.981 --> 36:48.286
All right.

36:50.538 --> 36:52.501
I think that's a good decision.

36:55.927 --> 36:57.235
And the tour...

36:57.236 --> 37:00.545
I... I think it's the perfect cover.

37:01.378 --> 37:03.450
Both publicly and privately.

37:04.927 --> 37:06.219
Yeah.

37:07.715 --> 37:08.996
Rayna...

37:10.697 --> 37:13.686
I never imagined that we'd
ever end up like this.

37:14.910 --> 37:17.687
And I love you, too, and I
wanna try and make this work.

37:38.231 --> 37:40.081
Just needs more height up here.

37:40.940 --> 37:44.475
You... you look lovely.

37:44.832 --> 37:46.448
Thanks, Glenn.

37:48.097 --> 37:52.530
Ah. Photographers are already
five deep around the church.

37:52.823 --> 37:54.706
It's gonna be a zoo over there.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.005
You want me to ride with
you just to make sure

37:56.006 --> 37:57.128
everything goes smoothly?

37:57.129 --> 37:59.777
And ruin my grand entrance? Come on.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.194
You know me.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.020
I can take care of myself.

38:07.529 --> 38:08.465
What's that?

38:08.466 --> 38:10.105
Messenger just delivered it.

38:10.373 --> 38:11.776
"This was my grandmother's.

38:11.777 --> 38:12.880
"I'm sure she'd want you to wear it

38:12.881 --> 38:16.343
when you join our family. Love, Sean."

38:16.474 --> 38:17.688
Aw.

38:18.518 --> 38:19.913
Let's see.

38:20.826 --> 38:23.148
Here. You wanna hold this?

38:25.742 --> 38:27.288
It's perfect.

38:36.445 --> 38:38.021
Heard you played with J.T.

38:38.022 --> 38:39.847
And the rest of Avery's band last night.

38:40.107 --> 38:41.320
Mm-hmm.

38:41.450 --> 38:42.733
How'd that go?

38:43.068 --> 38:44.701
They asked me to join the band.

38:45.403 --> 38:46.869
Not surprised.

38:47.029 --> 38:50.005
But... singing somebody else's songs

38:50.006 --> 38:53.023
just made me think how much
fun I have singing ours.

38:54.839 --> 38:57.669
And I did finish the
lyrics to that one if...

38:57.798 --> 38:59.363
You wanna read 'em?

38:59.364 --> 39:00.492
No.

39:02.288 --> 39:03.853
Rather hear 'em.
