WEBVTT

01:11.574 --> 01:16.034
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

01:16.245 --> 01:22.531
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.917
Hey!

01:56.654 --> 02:00.900
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

02:03.910 --> 02:07.528
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

02:07.747 --> 02:10.616
Excuse me.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.585
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

02:28.973 --> 02:34.215
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

02:44.569 --> 02:47.321
I broke the window again.

02:47.530 --> 02:51.479
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

02:51.700 --> 02:58.069
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

03:03.127 --> 03:07.622
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone...

03:07.839 --> 03:13.544
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.212
And who do you think that guy was?

03:18.390 --> 03:23.051
- Emilio Estevez.
- "The Mighty Duck". I was there!

03:23.269 --> 03:28.938
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

03:32.568 --> 03:37.443
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

04:11.185 --> 04:15.395
Oh, man. It was perfect that time.

04:15.605 --> 04:18.226
Four months of work for nothing.

04:21.652 --> 04:25.067
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

04:25.280 --> 04:32.277
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.071
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

04:39.292 --> 04:42.743
<i>She is so into you.</i>

04:47.090 --> 04:51.169
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, "T.J. Hooker".

04:54.972 --> 05:00.178
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

05:00.393 --> 05:06.015
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

05:07.399 --> 05:10.850
Way to go! You got her badge number.

05:11.069 --> 05:18.565
And you got a date to meet her at
The Municipal State Court. Up top.

05:18.783 --> 05:21.025
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

05:30.669 --> 05:35.496
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

05:35.715 --> 05:38.549
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

05:38.759 --> 05:42.341
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.
- Steve Butabi.

05:42.554 --> 05:46.302
- You're brothers?
- No.

05:46.515 --> 05:50.559
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

05:50.769 --> 05:54.019
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

05:54.230 --> 05:59.437
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

06:05.156 --> 06:09.901
- Is that...?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

06:10.119 --> 06:13.902
Richard Grieco.

06:17.333 --> 06:21.117
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.207
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

06:24.422 --> 06:30.294
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

06:30.510 --> 06:36.798
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

06:37.016 --> 06:43.220
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

06:43.439 --> 06:49.441
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary TV-star.

06:49.652 --> 06:53.780
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.403
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

07:00.620 --> 07:04.534
So, maybe when we get in?

07:04.748 --> 07:12.791
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

07:13.005 --> 07:17.916
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

07:18.135 --> 07:23.294
"The Mighty Duck", man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

07:26.140 --> 07:29.142
"Emilio...!"

07:31.770 --> 07:36.682
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

08:03.173 --> 08:08.000
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

08:09.803 --> 08:13.670
That was in my nose.

08:16.267 --> 08:22.636
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

08:22.856 --> 08:26.640
Get off... Watch it!

08:30.529 --> 08:35.770
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

08:35.991 --> 08:42.030
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

08:42.248 --> 08:45.367
Is it better than last year's?

08:45.584 --> 08:50.162
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

08:51.839 --> 08:54.045
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

08:54.258 --> 08:58.800
It's a health shake.
It helps me hit my physical peak.

08:59.012 --> 09:02.594
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

09:02.807 --> 09:07.966
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

09:08.186 --> 09:14.140
Steve? In the store in a half hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

09:14.358 --> 09:18.901
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

09:19.112 --> 09:22.315
"Flying rat's ass..."
That would be wild to see.

09:22.532 --> 09:28.651
Steve, at the store in a half hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

10:26.460 --> 10:31.252
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.381
Are you all right? Sure?

10:51.690 --> 10:58.487
Finally. An hour and a half late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

10:58.697 --> 11:02.563
Idiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

11:02.783 --> 11:07.112
Idiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

11:13.084 --> 11:19.619
Hi. How are you paying for these?
Cash, check or charge?

11:19.839 --> 11:22.330
- Charge.
- Okay.

11:22.550 --> 11:27.674
- Is this a Visa or a Mastercard?
- Move your thumb.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.805
Good one. Okay.

11:32.559 --> 11:39.805
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

11:48.322 --> 11:52.782
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorization. Card number?

11:52.993 --> 11:56.741
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

11:56.954 --> 12:00.738
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

12:00.958 --> 12:07.042
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

12:07.255 --> 12:10.837
I can go for that.

12:11.050 --> 12:15.794
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

12:17.680 --> 12:23.350
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.638
Hi. Can I help you?

12:29.857 --> 12:34.649
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

12:34.860 --> 12:38.194
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

12:38.406 --> 12:40.861
Let's shake it.

12:41.075 --> 12:47.195
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

12:47.414 --> 12:51.458
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

12:51.667 --> 12:55.961
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. Idiot... Useless!

13:06.430 --> 13:11.340
- Steve...?
- Don't look.

13:11.559 --> 13:15.177
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

13:15.396 --> 13:21.433
So, you're back from school, working
for your dad at the lamp store?

13:21.650 --> 13:26.111
I missed you. You said when I
got back, we could get together.

13:26.322 --> 13:29.856
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.989
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

13:34.203 --> 13:41.201
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

13:41.459 --> 13:46.121
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

13:46.339 --> 13:52.874
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

13:53.094 --> 13:57.174
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

13:57.390 --> 14:01.802
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

14:02.019 --> 14:07.474
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

14:08.816 --> 14:14.236
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

14:14.446 --> 14:18.395
You know, Steve likes you very much.

14:18.616 --> 14:25.448
Mr. Butabi. Is Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

14:25.664 --> 14:29.530
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

14:29.750 --> 14:32.585
- we won't have to hire salesmen.

14:32.795 --> 14:38.547
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

14:38.758 --> 14:45.756
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl... Yes, you do!

14:45.972 --> 14:51.179
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

14:51.394 --> 14:55.307
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

14:55.522 --> 15:04.145
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy Island".

15:04.363 --> 15:07.814
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

15:08.033 --> 15:13.157
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

15:13.370 --> 15:20.084
Is this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

15:22.420 --> 15:26.369
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

15:26.590 --> 15:32.425
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

15:36.807 --> 15:41.267
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

15:41.478 --> 15:45.890
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

15:46.107 --> 15:50.104
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

15:50.319 --> 15:56.321
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside...

15:56.532 --> 16:00.481
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

16:00.702 --> 16:08.496
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

16:08.709 --> 16:13.869
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

16:14.089 --> 16:18.750
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

16:18.968 --> 16:25.716
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

16:25.932 --> 16:29.348
That's why we love you and hate you.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.810
- Still friends?
- You know it.

16:33.022 --> 16:36.224
I'm glad we had this talk.

16:52.496 --> 16:55.781
I had a great idea for the store...

16:55.999 --> 17:02.250
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about... Hey, what's up?

17:02.463 --> 17:06.959
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

17:07.175 --> 17:11.503
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.757
Why are you forgetting our plans?

17:14.973 --> 17:19.848
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

17:20.060 --> 17:26.858
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

17:27.067 --> 17:32.357
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

17:32.572 --> 17:38.111
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

17:38.327 --> 17:41.244
- We can't...
- We can. You know why?

17:41.455 --> 17:46.579
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

17:46.792 --> 17:51.370
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

17:51.588 --> 17:56.249
We can get into the Roxbury.

17:56.467 --> 18:00.132
Roxbury...!

18:04.808 --> 18:09.801
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

18:11.522 --> 18:18.354
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

18:20.279 --> 18:23.944
- Hello?
- What's up?

18:24.157 --> 18:29.151
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

18:29.370 --> 18:34.790
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.539
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

18:40.755 --> 18:45.665
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

18:45.884 --> 18:51.589
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

18:51.806 --> 18:55.388
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

19:11.698 --> 19:13.571
Good.

19:13.783 --> 19:16.404
What's going on...?

19:18.287 --> 19:21.785
Are you from out of town...?

19:56.819 --> 20:02.323
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

20:02.532 --> 20:07.407
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- Isn't on our things-to-do-list.

20:07.620 --> 20:12.577
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

20:12.790 --> 20:16.373
I don't want to!

20:17.670 --> 20:21.537
How do I get through
to this individual?

20:21.757 --> 20:25.007
Doug is like a fax machine.

20:25.218 --> 20:30.425
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

20:30.640 --> 20:36.060
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

20:36.269 --> 20:42.223
- Actually, I always screw it up...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

20:42.440 --> 20:49.356
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

20:49.572 --> 20:54.648
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

21:21.933 --> 21:26.310
<i>You can take away our phones
and our keys, but not our dreams.</i>

21:26.520 --> 21:30.767
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

21:30.982 --> 21:33.473
Later much!

21:36.654 --> 21:43.534
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

21:43.743 --> 21:46.613
How old are these? How embarrassing.

21:46.829 --> 21:51.289
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.627
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- It looks like you were making out.

22:08.222 --> 22:13.049
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

22:13.268 --> 22:17.728
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

22:19.524 --> 22:24.683
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

22:24.903 --> 22:29.399
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

22:29.615 --> 22:35.867
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

22:36.079 --> 22:40.123
<i>No, you take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.</i>

22:42.460 --> 22:47.702
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

22:47.923 --> 22:53.627
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

22:55.763 --> 23:01.765
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

23:01.976 --> 23:07.480
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

23:07.689 --> 23:09.729
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

23:09.940 --> 23:15.183
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

23:15.404 --> 23:19.484
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

23:19.700 --> 23:23.613
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

23:23.828 --> 23:26.663
See you next week.

23:26.872 --> 23:31.783
<i>- My good hombre. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.</i>

23:32.002 --> 23:36.414
- You're brothers?
- No... Yes.

23:36.630 --> 23:39.714
- Man!
- Works every time.

23:39.925 --> 23:43.009
Now I remember. You can't come in.

23:45.179 --> 23:50.006
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

23:50.225 --> 23:54.223
Time to play a little softball.

23:54.437 --> 24:00.226
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You still can't come in.

24:00.442 --> 24:05.816
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

24:08.616 --> 24:12.447
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

24:12.660 --> 24:18.663
George Washington
and George Washington?

24:20.418 --> 24:27.914
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

24:28.132 --> 24:33.636
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.551
Thanks... Great.

24:42.310 --> 24:46.854
- Is that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

24:47.065 --> 24:50.516
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

24:50.735 --> 24:56.523
- That's just Weight Watchers...
- ATM. That's it.

25:02.745 --> 25:07.371
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

25:07.583 --> 25:11.283
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

25:13.463 --> 25:17.542
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

25:17.758 --> 25:25.135
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

25:25.348 --> 25:27.885
Jesus, man.

25:28.100 --> 25:32.678
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

25:34.522 --> 25:40.773
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

25:40.986 --> 25:45.777
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

25:45.990 --> 25:52.870
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

25:53.914 --> 25:56.914
- Amazing.
- It all comes from within.

25:57.125 --> 26:00.374
He felt it because he's an actor.

26:01.795 --> 26:07.037
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

26:21.437 --> 26:26.940
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

26:27.150 --> 26:31.147
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

26:34.280 --> 26:37.780
What's up...?

26:40.787 --> 26:45.495
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

26:45.707 --> 26:50.036
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

26:50.253 --> 26:54.120
What's up? Two, three, four...

26:58.510 --> 27:01.047
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

27:01.262 --> 27:04.263
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

27:04.473 --> 27:10.676
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

27:10.895 --> 27:13.564
Who are your friends?

27:13.773 --> 27:18.399
- Mr. Zadir owns the place.
- Doug Butabi.

27:18.610 --> 27:23.686
You look like good boys.
Come to my VIP table.

27:23.906 --> 27:26.575
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

27:26.784 --> 27:31.445
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

27:35.500 --> 27:41.169
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

27:41.380 --> 27:47.215
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

27:47.426 --> 27:51.589
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

27:51.805 --> 27:56.799
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

27:59.186 --> 28:02.685
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

28:02.898 --> 28:06.729
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

28:06.943 --> 28:10.358
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

28:12.823 --> 28:16.737
No.

28:16.950 --> 28:23.320
All right... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

28:23.540 --> 28:27.288
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

28:29.670 --> 28:36.087
I'm honored to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

28:36.300 --> 28:41.971
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.632
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

28:45.850 --> 28:50.180
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

28:50.396 --> 28:57.015
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.901
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

29:04.116 --> 29:08.612
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

29:08.829 --> 29:13.953
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

29:15.376 --> 29:18.994
Okay. Continue.

29:19.212 --> 29:25.713
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

29:25.927 --> 29:30.089
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

29:30.305 --> 29:35.809
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside...

29:36.018 --> 29:40.229
...it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

29:40.439 --> 29:45.065
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

29:45.276 --> 29:47.767
Doesn't that blow your mind?

29:48.946 --> 29:53.607
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

29:53.825 --> 29:59.945
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

30:00.164 --> 30:04.457
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

30:04.668 --> 30:08.914
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

30:09.130 --> 30:12.463
Great. Let's work.

30:12.674 --> 30:17.051
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

30:17.262 --> 30:19.669
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

30:19.889 --> 30:23.257
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

30:23.475 --> 30:28.183
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

30:28.396 --> 30:33.390
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

30:33.609 --> 30:38.851
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

30:39.072 --> 30:42.654
We have to get a meeting. Steve...?

30:56.670 --> 30:59.243
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

30:59.464 --> 31:03.710
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

31:03.926 --> 31:07.176
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

33:16.038 --> 33:19.407
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

33:27.882 --> 33:31.048
1980. Good year.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.877
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

33:35.096 --> 33:43.007
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

33:43.228 --> 33:48.684
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

33:48.899 --> 33:54.273
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

33:54.487 --> 33:57.986
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

33:58.199 --> 34:03.987
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

34:04.204 --> 34:10.206
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

34:10.418 --> 34:14.830
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

34:15.047 --> 34:18.746
- Yes, sir.
- It has to be in a can.

34:18.967 --> 34:21.172
He can't hear you.

34:21.385 --> 34:25.844
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

34:26.056 --> 34:29.056
- And your dad.
- What?

34:30.268 --> 34:34.679
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

34:34.897 --> 34:38.348
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

34:38.565 --> 34:42.016
Disco-dicks.

34:44.237 --> 34:48.899
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

34:49.117 --> 34:53.695
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

34:56.165 --> 35:02.036
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

35:02.253 --> 35:08.587
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

35:08.800 --> 35:12.963
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

35:13.179 --> 35:17.425
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

35:17.640 --> 35:22.801
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.721
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

35:26.940 --> 35:33.061
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

35:36.240 --> 35:40.237
She approved. Approved.

35:44.580 --> 35:50.499
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

36:00.886 --> 36:06.924
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

36:07.142 --> 36:12.597
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

36:12.813 --> 36:19.526
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

36:19.736 --> 36:24.148
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

36:24.364 --> 36:27.484
Let's set up a meeting.

36:27.700 --> 36:32.243
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

36:32.455 --> 36:34.743
Meeting!

36:34.957 --> 36:38.372
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

36:38.585 --> 36:43.080
This Italian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

36:43.297 --> 36:46.630
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

36:46.842 --> 36:52.381
- They're right behind you.
- BMW... Vanilla, mostly.

36:52.597 --> 36:56.261
- There you are.
- We got scared.

36:56.475 --> 37:00.175
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

37:00.395 --> 37:03.763
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

37:03.980 --> 37:07.978
Oh, okay.

37:08.193 --> 37:11.811
Like some other girls
would steal us away...

37:12.030 --> 37:17.071
Oh, right. Oh!

37:19.660 --> 37:23.824
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

37:24.040 --> 37:28.666
No... Yes! Oh, man.

37:28.877 --> 37:34.298
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

37:37.760 --> 37:41.971
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

37:43.265 --> 37:48.804
You know what I always thought
would make a cool "Twilight Zone"?

37:49.020 --> 37:52.886
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

37:53.106 --> 37:59.108
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

37:59.320 --> 38:01.893
No.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.529
Why don't you come over here?

38:05.742 --> 38:10.202
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.738
What?

38:19.420 --> 38:22.753
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

38:22.965 --> 38:28.255
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

38:29.554 --> 38:36.302
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

38:36.518 --> 38:41.808
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

38:44.024 --> 38:47.808
Steve!

38:50.905 --> 38:55.116
- I was wondering...
- What are you doing?

38:55.326 --> 39:00.829
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.158
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

39:04.375 --> 39:10.626
- Is that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

39:10.839 --> 39:14.918
I could see myself in your pants.

39:15.134 --> 39:20.258
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

39:24.184 --> 39:30.600
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra...

39:30.814 --> 39:36.400
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

39:36.610 --> 39:41.568
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

39:41.782 --> 39:45.993
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

39:46.202 --> 39:48.953
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

39:49.163 --> 39:52.531
Really? A cat? Interesting.

39:52.749 --> 39:58.205
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

39:58.420 --> 40:03.296
Something small, warm, fuzzy...

40:03.508 --> 40:05.999
Is this your first time?

40:06.219 --> 40:09.837
Yes. Isn't it yours?

40:11.849 --> 40:15.680
- Is this your first time?
- What?

40:15.894 --> 40:20.639
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

40:20.857 --> 40:28.815
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

40:29.030 --> 40:33.407
All right. Hey, where are you going?

40:38.246 --> 40:43.951
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just...

40:49.380 --> 40:54.719
Not that it hasn't happened before.
It was okay.

40:54.927 --> 40:58.675
I'm gonna go back in and...

41:02.100 --> 41:05.017
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

41:11.983 --> 41:17.225
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

41:25.203 --> 41:30.706
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

41:30.916 --> 41:34.201
Post-It notes to annotate important
documents.

41:34.419 --> 41:39.164
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

41:39.380 --> 41:43.248
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

41:43.468 --> 41:48.710
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

41:48.930 --> 41:54.304
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do... 12:30?

41:54.519 --> 41:57.639
Let me see.

42:02.109 --> 42:04.944
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

42:05.153 --> 42:09.281
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

42:09.490 --> 42:15.325
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

42:16.746 --> 42:21.289
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

42:23.544 --> 42:28.585
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

42:30.883 --> 42:37.336
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

42:37.556 --> 42:43.842
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

42:44.060 --> 42:46.931
Are your delicate fingers injured?

42:47.147 --> 42:51.524
- We're working our asses off.
- Our week's filling up quick.

42:51.734 --> 42:55.233
We've made
important business contacts.

42:55.446 --> 42:58.779
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

42:58.990 --> 43:03.451
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

43:03.660 --> 43:08.951
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

43:09.166 --> 43:14.408
- Yeah... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

43:14.629 --> 43:20.880
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

43:21.093 --> 43:27.095
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

43:27.306 --> 43:30.509
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

43:30.726 --> 43:36.680
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

43:36.898 --> 43:40.480
What about the stockroom?

43:41.568 --> 43:45.067
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

43:45.280 --> 43:49.111
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

43:49.325 --> 43:53.452
We'll make it without you.
You'll see.

43:53.662 --> 43:58.868
I'll see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

43:59.083 --> 44:05.203
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

44:05.422 --> 44:09.585
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.676
- Plus with my milky white skin...
- This is a major family crisis.

44:14.888 --> 44:18.138
I have to take
a rain check on this convo.

44:19.559 --> 44:25.679
Nice bulbs, Emily. And I don't
mean that metaphorically.

44:26.690 --> 44:31.185
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

45:11.144 --> 45:15.307
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

45:15.523 --> 45:20.943
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

45:21.153 --> 45:26.858
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

45:35.582 --> 45:39.994
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

45:40.210 --> 45:43.081
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

45:43.296 --> 45:49.665
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

45:49.885 --> 45:52.174
We have a meeting.

45:52.387 --> 45:57.298
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

46:00.144 --> 46:04.473
- Dooey... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

46:04.690 --> 46:09.979
- Raging party last night.
- Is that what my mother told you?

46:10.194 --> 46:14.108
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

46:14.323 --> 46:19.613
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

46:19.827 --> 46:24.405
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

46:24.623 --> 46:29.119
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

46:29.335 --> 46:33.498
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

46:33.714 --> 46:39.052
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

46:49.102 --> 46:53.016
That doesn't feel good at all...

46:54.815 --> 46:58.398
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

46:58.610 --> 47:04.564
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

47:04.782 --> 47:08.281
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

47:08.494 --> 47:12.657
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

47:12.872 --> 47:17.035
I know your tricks, Dooey.

47:29.678 --> 47:32.762
Maybe we should just go back to work.

47:32.973 --> 47:37.967
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

47:38.185 --> 47:42.681
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

47:47.819 --> 47:50.855
Cambi's number.

47:52.114 --> 47:58.234
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

47:58.453 --> 48:03.410
Diabetic.
I could see us doing that again.

48:03.624 --> 48:07.407
Maybe even a couple of times a week.

48:07.627 --> 48:11.790
The ladies await, my friend. Cell.

48:13.924 --> 48:18.004
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

48:18.219 --> 48:21.837
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

48:23.849 --> 48:27.893
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

48:28.103 --> 48:32.598
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

48:34.692 --> 48:39.816
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

48:41.906 --> 48:45.239
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

48:45.450 --> 48:49.033
That's a sweet show, too.

48:51.706 --> 48:57.993
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

48:58.212 --> 49:01.912
<i>- I'm at the Skybar.
- We'll be right there.</i>

49:02.132 --> 49:07.089
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

49:07.303 --> 49:10.920
Did you have a good time last night?

49:11.139 --> 49:15.302
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

49:15.518 --> 49:19.515
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

49:19.730 --> 49:24.391
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

49:24.609 --> 49:29.151
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

49:31.030 --> 49:36.487
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'll have to check your bag.

49:36.703 --> 49:44.116
The movie on this flight will be...
I can't think of any more.

49:44.334 --> 49:51.296
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

49:51.507 --> 49:57.461
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

49:57.679 --> 50:02.838
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

50:03.058 --> 50:09.724
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

50:13.650 --> 50:18.775
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

50:18.988 --> 50:22.938
<i>- You guys are a big waste of time.
- Como what?</i>

50:23.159 --> 50:28.318
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

50:28.538 --> 50:33.532
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

50:33.750 --> 50:37.369
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

50:37.588 --> 50:41.252
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

50:41.466 --> 50:45.048
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

50:45.260 --> 50:50.301
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

50:50.515 --> 50:56.220
<i>That's the problem. Poor schmucks
look just the same as rich schmucks.</i>

51:08.572 --> 51:14.111
- No... Yes...
- This is the worst day of my life.

51:14.327 --> 51:18.027
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

51:18.247 --> 51:21.662
I don't know how to respond to that.

51:21.875 --> 51:29.004
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

51:29.215 --> 51:33.792
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

51:34.010 --> 51:38.173
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

51:38.389 --> 51:47.391
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

51:47.605 --> 51:51.389
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

51:51.609 --> 51:55.107
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

51:55.320 --> 52:01.239
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

52:01.450 --> 52:07.238
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

52:07.455 --> 52:13.327
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

52:13.544 --> 52:19.297
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

52:19.507 --> 52:24.501
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

52:24.720 --> 52:29.215
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

52:29.432 --> 52:33.346
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

52:33.560 --> 52:36.182
- Do you want...?
- Stop talking to me.

52:36.397 --> 52:38.887
Fine. My pleasure.

53:22.936 --> 53:28.808
Little Post-Its, you little idiot.

53:29.024 --> 53:32.144
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

53:41.200 --> 53:45.245
<i>- You should take a lesson from it.
- Grieco.</i>

54:11.727 --> 54:17.101
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

54:17.315 --> 54:22.475
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

54:22.695 --> 54:28.649
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

54:28.867 --> 54:35.782
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

54:35.998 --> 54:40.077
Something has come up. Excuse me.

54:40.293 --> 54:46.247
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

54:46.465 --> 54:51.340
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

54:51.553 --> 54:57.175
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

55:00.268 --> 55:05.013
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

55:05.230 --> 55:08.599
I heard about your brother.

55:08.817 --> 55:14.440
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

55:14.656 --> 55:20.029
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

55:20.244 --> 55:24.111
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

55:24.330 --> 55:31.495
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

55:31.712 --> 55:36.836
It sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

55:37.050 --> 55:40.833
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

55:41.053 --> 55:44.836
That could take till... Saturday.

55:45.056 --> 55:50.346
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

55:50.560 --> 55:57.013
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

56:01.112 --> 56:03.270
I'll see you.

56:08.535 --> 56:14.287
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

56:40.186 --> 56:43.555
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

56:46.609 --> 56:50.688
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

57:23.640 --> 57:29.475
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

57:29.687 --> 57:32.889
"Covers the development of..."

57:33.106 --> 57:38.147
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

57:38.360 --> 57:43.781
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

57:43.990 --> 57:50.703
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

57:50.913 --> 57:55.373
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

57:55.584 --> 58:01.289
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'll have to read, and homework...

58:01.505 --> 58:06.131
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

58:06.343 --> 58:09.047
Do you want me to be less horny?

58:09.262 --> 58:14.552
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

58:14.767 --> 58:20.886
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

58:21.105 --> 58:24.474
Recliners and sofa beds...

58:24.692 --> 58:28.523
- And end tables and...
- Chairs.

58:28.737 --> 58:33.813
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

58:34.033 --> 58:40.201
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than Ikea... Home Depot.

58:44.625 --> 58:48.409
Ikea!

58:58.220 --> 59:03.427
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

59:04.892 --> 59:10.478
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

59:10.689 --> 59:14.733
What? No, I don't mean that.

59:14.943 --> 59:19.105
It's just that I don't...

59:23.408 --> 59:25.531
Okay.

59:37.962 --> 59:44.046
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

59:44.259 --> 59:47.710
I owe you big time for inviting me.

59:47.929 --> 59:53.682
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

59:55.519 --> 01:00:00.725
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.482
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

01:00:06.153 --> 01:00:10.778
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:15.901
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude...

01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:23.414
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up...! Idiot.

01:00:25.252 --> 01:00:29.201
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:35.127
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:40.089
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:44.553
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:49.229
- 10-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

01:00:49.439 --> 01:00:54.101
I'm having a hell of a time.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:06.574
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

01:01:06.787 --> 01:01:11.034
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:15.081
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

01:01:15.295 --> 01:01:23.752
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

01:01:23.969 --> 01:01:28.677
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.968
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

01:01:35.186 --> 01:01:40.393
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

01:01:40.608 --> 01:01:46.313
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

01:01:46.529 --> 01:01:51.440
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:54.232
You want to make a toast?

01:01:54.453 --> 01:01:58.070
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:09.127
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:14.085
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

01:02:14.303 --> 01:02:18.086
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

01:02:18.306 --> 01:02:23.347
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.642
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:39.193
Dad? Is there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

01:02:39.408 --> 01:02:45.112
<i>- Yes... No!
- That is so funny.</i>

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:50.453
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.074
Let me explain something.

01:02:53.294 --> 01:02:57.956
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:03.218
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:10.308
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

01:03:10.517 --> 01:03:15.593
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:20.309
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

01:03:20.526 --> 01:03:25.946
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

01:03:27.865 --> 01:03:31.565
These are perfectly normal feelings.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.664
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:59.220
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

01:03:59.434 --> 01:04:01.971
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:07.428
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:13.318
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:18.771
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

01:04:18.992 --> 01:04:21.198
Give me a call or page me.

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:26.286
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

01:04:26.498 --> 01:04:28.870
See you.

01:04:36.298 --> 01:04:41.173
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

01:04:41.386 --> 01:04:45.763
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:50.350
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no...

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:57.061
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

01:04:57.274 --> 01:05:01.852
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:05.189
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:11.325
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

01:05:11.536 --> 01:05:15.119
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:23.621
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:28.879
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $150.

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:32.675
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

01:05:32.888 --> 01:05:40.467
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:46.024
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

01:05:46.233 --> 01:05:50.146
I have to go. Leave me a message.

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:56.279
Hey... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

01:05:56.490 --> 01:06:01.995
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

01:06:02.204 --> 01:06:07.909
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:26.005
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join...

01:06:26.225 --> 01:06:30.969
Did we already start? Oh.

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:36.561
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:40.144
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:45.948
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:53.914
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

01:06:54.123 --> 01:06:58.203
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

01:06:58.419 --> 01:07:04.254
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

01:07:04.465 --> 01:07:08.463
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

01:07:08.677 --> 01:07:10.919
"Love Emily."

01:07:19.937 --> 01:07:23.685
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

01:07:23.899 --> 01:07:30.896
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

01:07:36.743 --> 01:07:40.076
Oh, I'm done.

01:07:40.288 --> 01:07:44.996
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:50.450
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:56.791
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:02.763
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:09.513
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

01:08:09.729 --> 01:08:14.022
My dad already paid the caterer.

01:08:15.609 --> 01:08:21.113
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

01:08:21.322 --> 01:08:24.857
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

01:08:31.122 --> 01:08:36.542
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:42.249
Now, Emily.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.372
With this ring...

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.434
Doug!

01:09:01.648 --> 01:09:05.395
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:08.859
Turn that music off!

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:14.147
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:19.527
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:23.447
- Mr. Butabi, I can't...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:30.913
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

01:09:41.807 --> 01:09:46.267
Emily... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:51.435
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:57.733
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

01:09:57.946 --> 01:10:03.781
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

01:10:03.993 --> 01:10:07.657
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.286
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:10:22.759 --> 01:10:26.127
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

01:10:26.345 --> 01:10:31.931
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:38.677
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:46.650
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

01:10:46.862 --> 01:10:50.729
Plus, I've always loved you.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.157
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

01:10:58.372 --> 01:11:03.792
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

01:11:06.212 --> 01:11:11.004
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today...

01:11:13.385 --> 01:11:18.212
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:21.550
That was all right.

01:11:21.767 --> 01:11:25.811
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:33.222
Look, Steve...

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.700
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

01:11:44.786 --> 01:11:50.491
I've been thinking...
You're my brother.

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:56.745
We're brothers,
and when we're together...

01:11:58.465 --> 01:12:01.038
I just...

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:06.339
You don't drag me down.

01:12:07.806 --> 01:12:11.885
I drag me down.

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:16.145
And you...

01:12:17.064 --> 01:12:20.064
You complete me.

01:12:20.275 --> 01:12:24.224
- Shut up.
- What?

01:12:24.445 --> 01:12:29.190
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:52.299
It seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:57.752
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

01:12:57.973 --> 01:13:00.725
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer...

01:13:00.934 --> 01:13:05.263
What other young man
does that remind you of?

01:13:06.522 --> 01:13:11.598
- Myself as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

01:13:15.405 --> 01:13:20.778
Mr. Grieco...
You see right through me.

01:13:33.879 --> 01:13:37.378
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:40.295
And you look good also.

01:13:40.509 --> 01:13:45.384
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

01:13:45.597 --> 01:13:49.843
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:54.519
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.189
- Is that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

01:14:02.403 --> 01:14:05.273
Pull over. Let's check it out.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:18.872
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:25.832
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

01:14:26.048 --> 01:14:31.967
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.758
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

01:14:40.602 --> 01:14:45.347
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:48.898
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.234
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:05.746
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

01:15:05.957 --> 01:15:09.539
- Our club?
- I cut you in. It was your idea.

01:15:09.752 --> 01:15:14.627
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

01:15:14.839 --> 01:15:17.840
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:23.008
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.428
What is he up to now?

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.305
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:30.519 --> 01:15:33.603
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

01:15:38.026 --> 01:15:42.402
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

01:15:42.613 --> 01:15:48.318
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:51.784
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

01:15:51.996 --> 01:15:56.823
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

01:15:57.042 --> 01:16:01.584
That voice sounds so familiar.

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:08.634
- Are you...?
- Doug?

01:16:08.843 --> 01:16:12.793
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

01:16:13.014 --> 01:16:17.058
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

01:16:17.267 --> 01:16:23.102
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

01:16:23.314 --> 01:16:26.848
Am I what you expected?

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:31.561
I totally approve.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:37.365
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

01:16:39.453 --> 01:16:42.204
Hottie police officer?

01:16:42.414 --> 01:16:47.324
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

01:16:47.543 --> 01:16:52.085
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.884
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:16:58.094 --> 01:17:02.719
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.880
I broke the window again.
