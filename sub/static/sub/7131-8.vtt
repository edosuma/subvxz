[bell dings]

00:12.000 --> 00:13.792
You and Helen?

00:13.792 --> 00:17.583
She's a wild one, with that
little swastika down there?

00:17.583 --> 00:19.291
That's a flower.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.667
He's going around
telling people

00:20.667 --> 00:23.125
I have some sort
of anti-Semitic twat?

00:23.125 --> 00:25.417
Oh, I'm gonna
fucking kill him.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.917
Okay, now I'm
a little scared.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.458
He  should be scared.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.333
Fucking brilliant.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.291
Really?

00:32.291 --> 00:35.333
I would love to do this.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.291
Great.

00:37.291 --> 00:39.875
Do you want me
in your show?

00:42.166 --> 00:44.959
A key?
After two weeks?

00:44.959 --> 00:48.041
It's just--
it's too much too fast.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.834
You have to tell her
how you feel.

00:50.834 --> 00:52.333
I know she's your friend,

00:52.333 --> 00:55.458
but I'm not sure she has
our best interests at heart.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.834
No?

00:56.834 --> 00:58.500
She's clearly
in love with you.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.542
Beverly?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.291
[laughing]
Oh, that's crazy.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.417
Oh, please.
Look at her hair.

01:06.709 --> 01:09.583

01:46.625 --> 01:49.208
[gunshot]

02:02.667 --> 02:04.625
There's timing.
How was the gym?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.250
This idiot woman
on the treadmill next to me

02:07.250 --> 02:10.750
was yakking on her phone
the entire time.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.166
I hate people.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.917
And there's
a big bloody sign

02:13.917 --> 02:15.792
right in front
of her, saying,

02:15.792 --> 02:17.917
"No phones."

02:17.917 --> 02:18.959
I rest my case.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.250
So I'm staring at her,

02:20.250 --> 02:22.750
trying to blow her up
with my mind,

02:22.750 --> 02:26.417
and then I look up at the sign,
and then I look back to her,

02:26.417 --> 02:29.917
then up at the sign again,
and she's just rattling on,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.625
- totally oblivious.
- Mm.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.208
I swear,

02:33.208 --> 02:34.917
it was all I could do
not to grab her fucking phone

02:34.917 --> 02:37.083
and throw it across the gym.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.583
Why didn't you just
say something?

02:38.583 --> 02:41.375
Ah, I didn't want to make
a big deal of it.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.750
Ah, look who's here.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.208
Oh.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.166
Oh, look.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.667
There's your girlfriend.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.917
She's not my--

02:47.917 --> 02:49.625
- Morning.
- Hi.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.667
Whoo.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.041
Almost got me there.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.291
Almost.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.625
Actually, you are just
the person I wanted to see.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.542
- Oh?
- I got the weirdest call

02:59.542 --> 03:01.333
yesterday
from Matt LeBlanc's agent,

03:01.333 --> 03:03.667
saying you'd offered him
a role in Opposite?

03:03.667 --> 03:05.041
Oh, right.

03:05.041 --> 03:07.125
I was like, "What?"

03:07.125 --> 03:08.458
So sorry,
totally our fault.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.125
Matt read the script,
wanted to do it.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.291
We didn't know
how to say no.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.000
Welcome to my world.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.500
We finally told him
last night.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.208
It was not pretty.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.625
Well, next time, I'd just
appreciate a little heads-up.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.709
Absolutely.

03:20.709 --> 03:23.875
Hopefully there won't be
a next time.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.542
Anyway, uh, we are late
for a table read.

03:26.542 --> 03:27.625
We got to go.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.083
Bye-bye.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.542
I like her.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.667
She's great,
isn't she?

03:34.667 --> 03:36.625
Um...

03:36.625 --> 03:38.125
Whoo.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.583
Almost got me again.

03:39.583 --> 03:42.333
I know.
[laughs]

03:42.333 --> 03:44.458
[laughs]

03:44.458 --> 03:46.000
What the hell was that?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.750
What?

03:47.750 --> 03:50.500
What?
She practically ran me over.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.208
It was an accident.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.375
Maybe the first time.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.500
You're saying
it was deliberate?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.792
Well, it's not like I'm
a squirrel crossing the highway.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.208
Oh, please.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.542
And did you notice
she hardly looked at me?

04:01.542 --> 04:02.667
- No?
- No.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.041
She only looked at you.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.250
Well, I've always had
a way with the lesbians.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.208
At school, they used to say
I could turn a woman gay.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.750
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
I found it deeply troubling.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.291
Speaking of which...

04:16.291 --> 04:17.709
[engine revs]

04:17.709 --> 04:20.583
[sighs]
I suppose we had to
see him eventually.

04:20.583 --> 04:24.709
Look, actors don't get cast
in parts all the time.

04:24.709 --> 04:26.208
He's a big boy.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.542
At a certain point, he's just
gonna have to acc--

04:27.542 --> 04:30.250
- Hey.
- Morning.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.750
Clearly he has not
reached that point.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.792
I would say not.

04:37.792 --> 04:41.333
Oh, so awful.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.291
[sighs]
Okay.

04:43.291 --> 04:46.667
Well, let us know
if you hear anything else.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.333
Oh.
[sighs]

04:48.333 --> 04:49.500
Good news?

04:49.500 --> 04:52.667
Up Till Now
had to shut down.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.417
What? Why?

04:54.417 --> 04:57.500
The guy playing the best friend,
the stand-up, Adam Bailen?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.834
I think it's Ballen.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.542
No, Bailen.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.750
Are you sure?

05:01.750 --> 05:03.542
She said Bailen.

05:03.542 --> 05:05.792
All this time
I've been saying Ballen.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.291
That's embarrassing.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.583
- What about him?
- He's dead.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.375
What?

05:11.375 --> 05:14.750
He fell off the back
of a boat last night.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.375
They just found his body.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.583
Oh, my God.

05:18.583 --> 05:22.458
What was he doing
on a boat?

05:22.458 --> 05:24.208
Boating?

05:24.208 --> 05:27.291
Why?

05:27.291 --> 05:30.208
[sighs]

05:30.208 --> 05:31.709
He was so young.

05:31.709 --> 05:35.792
And so talented,
really funny.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.000
I know.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.291
And he had just lost
all that weight.

05:39.291 --> 05:42.208
Oh, it's heartbreaking.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.291
- So now we have to recast?
- Oh.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.041
It's the middle
of pilot season.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.834
- What a fucking nightmare.
- [sighs]

05:50.834 --> 05:52.458
What about Matt LeBlanc?

05:52.458 --> 05:54.166
God knows he's available.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.709
Hmm.
Not too old?

05:56.709 --> 05:59.250
Well, what's-his-name
could have an old best friend.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.333
Nah, sounds depressing.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.375
- I guess.
- I still like him, though.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.625
We should keep him in mind
for something.

06:06.625 --> 06:07.792
Hmm.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.458
What?

06:10.458 --> 06:12.625
You still pissed
at Merc?

06:12.625 --> 06:15.375
What do you think?
Why?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.750
So, what's the big news?

06:17.750 --> 06:21.542
Well, we were talking about
possible hosts for your show.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.417
Yeah?
You like my new list?

06:23.417 --> 06:26.291
Mm, it's definitely better,

06:26.291 --> 06:28.667
in that all of them
are alive.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.166
[scoffs]
You're welcome.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.375
Except for Gene Rayburn,

06:32.375 --> 06:35.333
who is, in fact, dead.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.542
Oh, man.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.208
I can't catch a break.

06:38.208 --> 06:41.834
That's fine, 'cause we
actually have an idea

06:41.834 --> 06:43.208
that we are
very excited about.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.125
Well, if you're excited,
I'm excited.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.458
(Helen)
Oh, I'm excited.

06:46.458 --> 06:47.542
There's an actor.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.041
He's charming.
He's funny.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.500
- And alive?
- Very much so.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.625
Sounds perfect.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.125
[all laugh]

06:53.125 --> 06:55.750
He's never done
anything like this before.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.333
So who is it?
You're killing me here.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.583
Oh, just you wait.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.125
- Do you want to...?
- Yeah.

07:01.125 --> 07:04.500
This should
really come from me.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.959
Matt LeBlanc.

07:08.959 --> 07:09.917
[laughs]

07:09.917 --> 07:11.083
That's a joke, right?

07:11.083 --> 07:12.709
Am I laughing?

07:12.709 --> 07:15.166
Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:15.166 --> 07:16.709
Not a fan?

07:16.709 --> 07:19.083
There's no way that cocksucker
is hosting my show.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.709
Really?

07:20.709 --> 07:23.333
See, I thought
you wanted to get on the air.

07:23.333 --> 07:28.000
Look, there's got
to be somebody else.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.500
Mm, not for me.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.667
You know Helen.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.417
When she gets an idea
in her head...

07:33.417 --> 07:36.250
Please, I am begging you,
don't do this.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.875
Come on,
we've got history.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.959
Oh, I think we are all aware
of our history.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.583
Oh, Jesus.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.250
Is that what this is?
Because she told you about--

07:47.250 --> 07:50.542
Absolutely not.
Give me some credit.

07:50.542 --> 07:55.250
I swear
on my little swastika tattoo,

07:55.250 --> 07:58.709
this is nothing personal.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.417
[chuckles]

08:01.417 --> 08:04.375
Are you fucking kidding me?
Merc Lapidus?

08:04.375 --> 08:06.083
I'm telling you, he said
he can't do it without you.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.250
- Bullshit.
- I talked to the man myself.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.041
Well, I don't care.
No fucking way.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.583
Look, I get it.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.083
Obviously, you don't,
'cause if you did--

08:13.083 --> 08:15.500
Can you set aside your personal
feelings for one minute?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.458
- No.
- This is a business decision.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.291
You asked me
to bring you a project.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.917
This is an amazing project.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.750
Okay, maybe I should have been
more specific.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.041
Bring me a project
that isn't produced

08:25.041 --> 08:26.458
by a lying, evil,

08:26.458 --> 08:31.166
piece-of-shit,
fuckface scumbag.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.542
- [chuckles]
- How are you?

08:32.542 --> 08:34.583
- We love you.
- [giggling]

08:34.583 --> 08:36.291
Oh.
Love you too.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.583
Uh, we know
you're eating, but--

08:38.583 --> 08:41.792
Yeah, sure.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.417
San...ni...ichi.

08:43.417 --> 08:45.083
[camera shutter clicks]

08:45.083 --> 08:46.291
Huh?

08:46.291 --> 08:50.959
[all speaking Japanese]

08:50.959 --> 08:52.166
How we doing here?

08:52.166 --> 08:55.291
- Again?
- Yeah.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.959
San...ni...ichi.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.291
[camera shutter clicks]

08:59.291 --> 09:03.417
[all speaking Japanese]

09:03.417 --> 09:06.166
[camera shutter clicks]
- There you go.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.375
[speaking Japanese]

09:07.375 --> 09:08.583
Okeydokey.
This was great.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.500
Bye-bye.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.458
Go on.
Konnichiwa.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.000
He got fat.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.417
[scoffs]

09:17.417 --> 09:19.250
At least listen
to the deal.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.583
Jesus Christ.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.500
It's not just money.
I got you points.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.208
You would own
a big piece of the show.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.166
I don't care. I'm not gonna be
a fucking game-show host.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.375
First of all,
it's more than just a game show.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.625
This has the potential
to be an event.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.458
Apparently it is huge
in Holland.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.458
Everything's huge
in Holland.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.583
The stupid country's,
like, this big.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.000
Look, my job
is to advise you.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
You want my advice?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.333
Don't be a schmuck.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.375
This could be
serious money for you,

09:44.375 --> 09:48.250
and right now
you need serious money.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.792
Okay, now, here's
my advice for you.

09:49.792 --> 09:51.041
I don't give a shit.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.542
I'll--I'll--

09:52.542 --> 09:54.583
I'll sell my beach house
before I work with that--

09:54.583 --> 09:56.417
that hugging,
two-faced, balding--

09:56.417 --> 09:58.291
Don't say Jewish.
Don't say Jewish.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.583
- Don't say Jewish.
- I wasn't gonna say Jewish.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.834
Okay.
Okay, I'm just--

10:01.834 --> 10:03.458
I'm just doing my job.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.250
[phone rings]

10:08.250 --> 10:10.542
Beverly Lincoln on one.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.125
[whispering]
Um, totally not a big deal,

10:21.125 --> 10:25.250
but in the future,
when Beverly calls,

10:25.250 --> 10:28.667
would you mind
not shouting it over to me?

10:28.667 --> 10:31.375
Oh, okay.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.083
[normal voice]
Like I say, not a big deal.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.083
[chuckles]

10:34.083 --> 10:37.583
But maybe skip
the intercom too.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.417
Just come in
and quietly say,

10:40.417 --> 10:42.542
[whispering]
"It's you-know-who."

10:42.542 --> 10:44.166
[whispering]
You-know-who.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.417
- [normal voice] Got it.
- [chuckles]

10:46.417 --> 10:49.458
Also, let's maybe
leave her off my phone sheet,

10:49.458 --> 10:51.375
just in case
people are like,

10:51.375 --> 10:53.542
"Mm, mm, mm," you know?

10:53.542 --> 10:54.917
Again...

10:54.917 --> 10:56.542
Not a big deal.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.917
- Exactly.
[elevator bell dings]

11:02.083 --> 11:04.375
Um, by the way,

11:04.375 --> 11:07.709
you-know-who
is still on hold.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.041
Right, yes.

11:09.041 --> 11:10.041
Thank you.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.792
[chuckles]

11:16.291 --> 11:19.041
[exhales sharply]

11:21.959 --> 11:23.291
[phone beeps]

11:23.291 --> 11:25.375
Hey, you.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.458
- Hello.
- Sorry about that.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.834
He had to pull me
out of a meeting.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.208
It's all right.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.125
So, what's cooking?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.667
I, uh,
just had a question.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.500
- Shoot.
- And be honest.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.291
- When am I not?
- Right now.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.792
Oh, all right.
What?

11:39.792 --> 11:43.000
[sighs]
Does Helen have
an issue with me?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.125
What?

11:45.125 --> 11:46.834
Helen? No.

11:46.834 --> 11:51.166
I just got a very strange vibe
from her yesterday.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.250
From Helen?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.375
That's crazy.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.500
Helen loves you.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.750
- Big, big fan.
- Really?

11:58.750 --> 12:01.291
Because it seemed like
she was trying to run me over.

12:01.291 --> 12:04.041
Oh, that's just Helen
having a little fun.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.333
[door opens]

12:05.333 --> 12:08.500
And I want it on my desk
first thing!

12:08.500 --> 12:10.667
- Ugh!
- Who was that?

12:10.667 --> 12:13.083
That idiot,
what's-his-name in research.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.083
Who, Stuart?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.333
Yes.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.458
Should we just fire him?

12:17.458 --> 12:19.500
Maybe. Maybe.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.875
Smart.
[clicks tongue]

12:20.875 --> 12:23.333
[chuckles]

12:23.333 --> 12:24.500
[sighs]

12:24.500 --> 12:25.709
[door closes]

12:25.709 --> 12:29.333
[ringtone playing]

12:29.333 --> 12:30.583
[cell phone beeps]

12:30.583 --> 12:32.875
- Yo.
- Matt, it's Britta.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.375
Hey.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.208
So it took me, like,
five minutes, and guess what.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.875
I've already got a potential
buyer for the beach house.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.375
Wow.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.250
That was fast.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.125
You know me.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.333
Who is it?

12:47.333 --> 12:49.500
- Uh, I can't tell you.
- Seriously?

12:49.500 --> 12:51.834
Oh, they made me sign
a confidentiality thing.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.000
Wow.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.875
Okay.
Miley Cyrus?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.583
That would be
telling you.

12:56.583 --> 12:57.542
I get it.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.083
- Jim Carrey?
- Stop.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.959
Who's the Bee Gee
that's still alive?

13:00.959 --> 13:02.875
- Barry?
- Is it him?

13:02.875 --> 13:05.125
I am not playing
this game.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.333
All right, well,
just tell me one thing.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.458
Has this person
ever been back to the future?

13:10.458 --> 13:13.083
Anyway, they want to come
Friday morning.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.750
Can you make
yourself scarce?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.041
I have to be scarce?
It's my house.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.917
Well, first of all, the seller
should never be there.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.250
Plus, his people
actually insisted on it.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.250
- So it's a he?
- I never said that.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.583
- Matt Damon.
- I'm not telling you.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.291
- Harrison Ford.
- I'm gonna hang up.

13:26.291 --> 13:27.458
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.917
Stop it.

13:28.917 --> 13:32.000
- So Friday morning?
- Yeah, fine.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.417
And they know I'm not taking
a penny less than my asking.

13:35.417 --> 13:36.625
I was very clear.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.917
Okay.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.083
I'll let you know
how it goes.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.333
Great.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.417
- Benedict Cumberbatch.
- No.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.083
- That's a real person, right?
- Yeah.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.458
Bye.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.583
[cell phone beeps]

13:53.458 --> 13:56.458
What the hell?

13:56.458 --> 13:58.125
Hey, hey.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.709
Hi.
Hello?

13:59.709 --> 14:02.500
Hi. What are you doing?
Those are our cars.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.792
Actually,
they're Mr. LeBlanc's cars.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.458
- Brilliant.
- Yeah, well, okay, technically,

14:06.458 --> 14:08.583
but he gave them to us.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.458
Well, I guess technically
he's taking them back.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.959
Unbelievable.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.750
(Beverly)
And yet in every way
believable.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.083
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.792
Just let me speak
to Mr. LeBlanc.

14:16.792 --> 14:19.375
I'm sure
I can persuade him to--

14:19.375 --> 14:20.166
Really?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.542
The cars?

14:21.542 --> 14:24.458
You're taking back
the cars?

14:24.458 --> 14:26.458
Is this how you're gonna
punish us?

14:26.458 --> 14:29.792
Doesn't this seem a little bit
petty, even for you?

14:29.792 --> 14:31.750
(man)
Nice persuading.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.041
You're a baby!

14:33.041 --> 14:34.750
It's fine.
Let it go.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.792
Oh, yeah, do you know what?
Take your bloody cars!

14:37.792 --> 14:39.834
Who cares?
Take--take them!

14:39.834 --> 14:42.208
Go! Go! Go!

14:44.959 --> 14:46.291
Aren't your sunglasses
in there?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.750
Oh, shit.
Fuck!

14:47.750 --> 14:51.166
Wait! Wait!

14:51.166 --> 14:53.834
Wait! Wait!

14:53.834 --> 14:55.709
[keys clacking,
bell dings]

14:55.709 --> 14:58.166
[seagulls crying]

15:00.583 --> 15:01.959
You're still here.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.333
I'm leaving now.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.875
Uh, that's what you said
half an hour ago.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.333
Calm down. I'm going.
This is good-bye.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.542
Yeah, I didn't believe it
when Cher said it,

15:10.542 --> 15:12.208
and I don't believe it now.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.166
Go.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.917
Okay.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.333
What are you doing?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.125
I'm just gonna get some coffee
on the way out.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.000
- Do you want some?
- You've got to get out of here.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.166
[doorbell buzzes]

15:21.166 --> 15:23.375
Oh, shit.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.667
Oh, well.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.875
Not "oh, well."
Go out the back.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.709
Relax.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.667
I just want to see
who it is.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.291
All right.
And then you'll go?

15:32.291 --> 15:34.375
Then I'll go.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.291
[intercom beeps]
- Hi.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.500
It's Ron.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.625
Come on in.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.250
[intercom beeps,
gate opens]

15:40.250 --> 15:42.375
I don't even recognize
that guy.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.667
What's he been in?

15:43.667 --> 15:45.375
Real estate.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.375
He's the agent.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.375
What the fuck?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.041
Oh, right.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.250
You were on his show.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.166
His show?

16:03.166 --> 16:05.417
(Britta)
Okay, you saw him.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.583
Now leave.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.917
Dude!
[laughs]

16:08.917 --> 16:10.417
Are you looking
at this place too?

16:10.417 --> 16:12.166
Uh...

16:12.166 --> 16:14.417
No.
I live here.

16:14.417 --> 16:15.834
No way.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.083
They told me
it was someone famous,

16:17.083 --> 16:19.500
but I never thought of you.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.417
Well, it's me.

16:21.417 --> 16:22.792
This is crazy.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.500
Can you imagine
if I bought your house?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.333
I cannot.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.875
How do you even have the money
for this?

16:28.875 --> 16:31.375
I know, right?
It's nuts.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.583
I got three movies
back-to-back.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.333
- Seriously?
- It's this franchise.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.250
They're based
on this trilogy.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.583
I haven't read 'em,
'cause there's, like, three.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.291
Sure.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.500
Anyway, how about a tour?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.750
Actually,
I was just on my way out.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.041
He was.

16:47.041 --> 16:50.291
No, come on, man.
You got to show me around.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.333
Fine.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.417
Living room.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.792
Holy shit.

16:58.792 --> 17:01.458
This is awesome.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.583
Yep.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.750
- I would not change one thing.
- Okay.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.625
This is like
a fucking '90s museum.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.750
- [chuckles]
- What?

17:08.750 --> 17:10.667
It's like time
stopped in here.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.458
[laughs]
My parents had these chairs.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.083
Uh, by the way,
all the furnishings

17:15.083 --> 17:18.500
are included
in the sale price.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.875
Oh, my God.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.333
Was that you?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.417
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.166
Jesus.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.667
That piano is white!

17:32.667 --> 17:33.875
- You play?
- No.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.583
- You want to hear me play?
- No.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.458
All right, tour's moving.
Tour is moving!

17:38.458 --> 17:42.834
[playing upbeat song]

17:43.458 --> 17:44.834
Sorry.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.333
Whoa.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.333
Nice.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.625
And this is what 70 feet
of ocean frontage looks like.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.333
Oh, look at this.

17:56.333 --> 18:00.166
I'll bet you had some wild
parties back in the day.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.834
Yeah.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.667
It was me, Abe Lincoln,
and some guys from the Bible.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.125
Tour's moving!

18:07.125 --> 18:10.542
[keys clacking, bell dings]

18:10.542 --> 18:11.709
Hey.

18:11.709 --> 18:13.542
[whispering]
You-know-who on two.

18:13.542 --> 18:14.834
What?

18:14.834 --> 18:16.375
Oh.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.792
Thank you, Peter.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.959
Oh, eh, door closed?

18:19.959 --> 18:22.709
Yeah, sure, why not?
[chuckles]

18:26.333 --> 18:27.709
[exhales sharply]

18:27.709 --> 18:30.000
- Hi, honey.
- I need to speak with you.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.208
What's up?

18:31.208 --> 18:32.458
No, in person.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.625
Want to go for a hike
this afternoon

18:34.625 --> 18:36.709
or maybe grab a drink?

18:36.709 --> 18:39.625
I wish.
I am so swamped.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.458
Pilot season.
Blah!

18:41.458 --> 18:43.291
[chuckles]

18:43.291 --> 18:45.625
All right, well, I could come
over there if it's easier.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.542
Here?
No. No.

18:47.542 --> 18:51.041
That's crazy.
I'll come to you.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.667
How about
behind your stage?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.166
Behind our stage?

18:55.166 --> 18:56.458
Where the Dumpsters are?

18:56.458 --> 18:57.750
Are you serious?

18:57.750 --> 18:58.792

[keys clacking]

19:00.542 --> 19:02.208
All right, that's it.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.583
That's the house.
There you go.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.208
Bye-bye.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.458
(Stoke)
Hey, wait a second.
Can I ask you something?

19:07.458 --> 19:09.792
No.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.291
[sighs]

19:11.291 --> 19:13.959
What?

19:13.959 --> 19:17.208
Okay, so I got all this money
from these movies,

19:17.208 --> 19:21.417
and my guy is telling me
I got to buy something,

19:21.417 --> 19:22.583
but...

19:22.583 --> 19:25.959
I don't know shit
about real estate.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.041
Haven't heard
a question yet.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.041
Oh, okay, so I've seen a bunch
of different places,

19:30.041 --> 19:34.291
and this is definitely
the coolest.

19:34.291 --> 19:37.208
- Still no fucking question.
- Oh, okay.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.667
So I-I realize it's yours,

19:39.667 --> 19:41.750
but just, like...

19:41.750 --> 19:44.291
investment-wise...

19:44.291 --> 19:47.375
if you didn't have to sell it,
would you buy this place?

19:47.375 --> 19:49.041
What do you mean,
if I didn't have to sell it?

19:49.041 --> 19:50.792
Who told you
I have to sell it?

19:50.792 --> 19:52.792
- Uh...
- I may have said something.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.458
I don't have to sell it.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.125
I thought Britta said--
Yeah, I probably misheard.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.291
I don't have to
fucking sell it at all.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.709
Look, honey, don't--

20:00.709 --> 20:03.500
Okay, all right,
anyone who's an asshole,

20:03.500 --> 20:06.625
get out of my house.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.625
Get out of my house.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.667
Out of my house.

[exhales sharply]

20:11.917 --> 20:14.000
Take your fucking
grapefruit candles

20:14.000 --> 20:15.500
and get out of my house.

20:15.500 --> 20:19.166
And this is why we don't like
the seller at a showing!

20:21.333 --> 20:24.500
- What about just the piano?
- Out of my house!

What?

We are meeting in rubbish.

Ooh.

What is going on?

21:02.792 --> 21:04.375
Nothing.

Okay, you know
when I said

21:08.166 --> 21:11.166
Helen doesn't have
an issue with you?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.542
- Right.
- Helen has an issue with you.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.417
- Thank you.

21:16.417 --> 21:18.000

21:18.000 --> 21:20.834
Oh, you're gonna laugh.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.583
I bet I don't.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.709
It's so crazy, but...

21:27.583 --> 21:30.959
She's got this idea

21:30.959 --> 21:33.583
you might be...

- What?
- In love with me.

to say it like that.

My God.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.667
Of all the things
I imagined.

21:49.667 --> 21:50.792
- It's mad.
- I know.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.250
That's what I told her.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.583
So is she worried
you're in love with me?

21:54.583 --> 21:56.250
No.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.542
Well, why is that
so unlikely?

21:58.542 --> 22:01.458
In this fantasy world of hers,
I'm in love with you,

22:01.458 --> 22:03.583
but you're not
in love with me?

22:03.583 --> 22:05.709
Nope.

22:05.709 --> 22:07.417
Well...

22:07.417 --> 22:09.709
that's a bit rude.

22:09.709 --> 22:13.917
I guess she's thinking
it's more likely that...

22:13.917 --> 22:17.041
What, that it would go
this way, but not this way?

22:17.041 --> 22:19.083

in this scenario,

Carol is not
in love with me.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.875
