Good evening, ladies.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.278
No.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.713
Max, what are you doing?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.482
I know this neighborhood
is a circus,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.283
But our window's
becoming a freak show.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.519
Max, I don't think that
bearded lady earlier

00:20.521 --> 00:22.154
Was doing it on purpose.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.655
It's more
of a menopause thing.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.724
He can't afford a cupcake.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.393
He can't even
afford two wheels.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.495
[knocks]

00:29.497 --> 00:30.963
Hi. What can I get you?

00:30.965 --> 00:31.964
I'll take one vanilla.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.465
That'll be $4.

00:33.467 --> 00:37.469
Actually, madam, tonight
I'll be paying with a poem.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.706
We're paying
with a poem, madam.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.510
I pull. Shadows push.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.545
I was a child then.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.747
[whispers]
I was a child then.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.584
Spit it out.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.319
Hey, you want a poem?

00:54.321 --> 00:55.421
Roses are red,
violets are blue,

00:55.423 --> 00:57.523
Get a job!

00:57.525 --> 01:00.159
And another wheel!

01:00.161 --> 01:01.193
That felt good.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.594
I get why you do that.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.763
Wait till you get actual
fist-to-face contact.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.499
That's a real high.

Welcome to

01:22.216 --> 01:24.216
Where'd you hear about us?
Kitchen nightmares?

01:24.218 --> 01:27.086
[chuckles]
okay, max, let's get to it.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.620
We have to decide
what we're each gonna make

01:28.622 --> 01:29.955
For our pastry school
homework.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.523
Or true to form,
I'll blow it off,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.392
Beat you up,
and take yours.

01:33.394 --> 01:37.863
Of the top of my giant head,
I'm thinking sticky buns.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.532
Deke's dark sticky buns.

01:40.534 --> 01:44.436
We're talking about dessert, not
what's going on in your pants.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.072
Well, I would've baked brownies
until I remembered

01:47.074 --> 01:51.543
I smoked all the ingredients.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.213
Oh, my god,
guess who texted me again.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.547
Dame judi dench?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.982
Dame judes texts me
all the time.

01:56.984 --> 02:00.385
She's thirsty.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.422
More like "damn, judi dench."

02:03.424 --> 02:06.058
Oh, hi, deke.
Didn't know you were here.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.759
You're everywhere.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.829
Pastry school, on the phone with
max talking about pastry school,

02:10.831 --> 02:13.398
And now here at the counter
talking about elder sex

02:13.400 --> 02:15.501
With a beloved star
of stage and screen.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.835
You're like--

02:16.837 --> 02:18.570
What?

02:18.572 --> 02:22.708
Denzel washington trapped
in channing tatum's body?

02:25.512 --> 02:28.113
I get that a lot.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.348
Anyway, max,

02:29.350 --> 02:31.116
This is the fourth time
chef nicolas

02:31.118 --> 02:32.651
Has texted me
outside of school.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.320
And this time
he sent me a video. Look.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.157
Then, caroline, you spoon
the fat from the pan...

02:38.159 --> 02:40.325
It's him making breakfast
with his shirt open.

02:40.327 --> 02:44.263
What do you think it means?

02:44.265 --> 02:47.599
That he doesn't have
a fear of bacon splatters.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.135
He's totally flirting
with me, right?

02:50.137 --> 02:52.271
Totally. Chef nicolas
is hot for ya.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.373
He has to double up on aprons
when you're around,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.675
Know what I'm sayin'?

02:56.677 --> 03:00.279
Deke, this is just private
best friend stuff between girls.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.047
You know,
that you're not a part of.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.883
Can I not be a part of it?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.485
And since chef nicolas
is your teacher

03:06.487 --> 03:08.287
And I work at the school,

03:08.289 --> 03:10.289
I'd appreciate it if we kept
this just between us three.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.357
And me. I saw it
over your shoulder.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.892
Doesn't hold a candle

03:13.894 --> 03:16.795
To my series
of pantless meatloaf videos.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.699
Meatloaf.
Pick up.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.668
Okay, okay, max,
if you have time to lean,

03:22.670 --> 03:24.469
You have time to clean.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.205
And if I have time
to give you a punch,

03:26.207 --> 03:29.474
We have time to have lunch.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.544
Max, should we help him
find his mom?

03:37.083 --> 03:39.585
Oh, no, now there's
two of them.

03:39.587 --> 03:43.589
Like gremlins.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.192
Now, come on.
This is a diner, not study hall.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.260
You're working.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.229
I call it "spiritually dying,"

03:50.231 --> 03:52.331
But working's a good word
for what we do here too.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.067
We could figure it out
tomorrow night over some drinks.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.603
Couple of white wine spritzers.
Know what I'm sayin'?

03:57.605 --> 04:01.273
That you're a recently-widowed
woman on a girls' trip in boca?

04:01.275 --> 04:04.176
Well, I already ate my water,
so I'm good to go.

04:04.178 --> 04:07.246
I am out the door.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.681
Hi, I'm deke.
Bye, max.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.618
Oh, he's your friend?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.186
For a minute I thought
he was that kid

04:14.188 --> 04:17.889
I had out of wedlock
with linda evans.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.092
Okay, why are you
in here not working?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.194
And why are you
doing it without me?

04:22.196 --> 04:24.096
Look, I've been
texting with nicolas.

04:24.098 --> 04:27.432
He thirstay.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.269
He wants me to meet him for a
drink after his dinner tomorrow.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.305
After his dinner.
You know what that means.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.740
That he thinks he doesn't
have to buy you dinner

04:34.742 --> 04:37.409
Before he makes you
his slampiece?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.244
After dinner
is a booty call.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.746
Or as they say in France,

04:40.748 --> 04:43.415
[french accent]
"a call du bootay."

04:43.417 --> 04:45.083
So I need you
to hang out with me,

04:45.085 --> 04:47.286
Because if I don't have anything
else to do at that time,

04:47.288 --> 04:48.820
I won't be able
to resist him.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.222
I don't see it.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.923
Maybe because he never
pulled a knife on me,

04:51.925 --> 04:54.259
But to me he's,
like, asexual.

04:54.261 --> 04:58.930
Yeah, like a sexual object.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.433
Okay, well, I told deke I'd help
him with his homework,

05:01.435 --> 05:02.734
So you can
hang out with us.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.069
Hang out with deke?

05:04.071 --> 05:07.105
I didn't even like
the muppets on tv.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.341
But fine, it'll--
it'll keep me busy,

05:09.343 --> 05:11.643
Because max,
when nicolas looks at me,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.779
It does something
to my insides,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.580
And I want this
to be a relationship

05:15.582 --> 05:19.084
Before he does
something to my insides.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.186
If you keep talking
about your insides,

05:21.188 --> 05:24.890
I'm gonna kick you
on your outsides.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.527
Okay, so as far
as my dessert homework goes--

05:28.529 --> 05:29.961
He just texted me again.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.097
<i>"ou es-tu?"</i>
<i>"where are you?"</i>

05:32.099 --> 05:35.167
And he used <i>"tu"</i> not <i>"vous."</i>

05:35.169 --> 05:37.536
We've gone there.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.172
Then why are you still here?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.974
Because I can't go there, max,
I'm not ready.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.478
Oh, wax situation?

05:46.480 --> 05:49.047
Guys don't care about that.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.283
So as far as my dessert goes,
I went all-out

05:51.285 --> 05:53.218
And actually did
some real research.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.986
You googled desserts
with dirty names?

05:54.988 --> 05:56.855
Correcto.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.457
And it was harder
to pick one than I thought.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.960
I mean, you got your bundt cake,
your lady fingers,

06:01.962 --> 06:05.330
Kumquat pie...

06:05.332 --> 06:07.332
"kum" and "quat."

06:07.334 --> 06:09.000
It was right there the whole
time. How could I not see it?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.970
So I dug deep,
and I have the winner.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.906
Croquembouche.

06:14.908 --> 06:19.478
I don't know what that is,
but she sounds like a whore.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.480
It's a traditional
french wedding cake

06:21.482 --> 06:23.515
With vanilla cream-filled
profiteroles

06:23.517 --> 06:25.217
Dipped in hand-made
caramel.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.353
Said the only person here
not in pastry school.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.322
Oh, cool.
I didn't know what it was.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.324
Maybe I can help.

06:32.326 --> 06:37.295
I happen to know nicolas loves
a [accent] pear tarte tatin.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.402
Ta-ta-tan! No.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.771
I thought I'd distract myself
by going out with you guys,

06:45.773 --> 06:47.372
But it feels like
the day in high school

06:47.374 --> 06:50.375
I hung out with the smokers
for street cred.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.943
And I used to hang out
with rich geeks like you

06:51.945 --> 06:53.912
When I needed lunch money.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.781
I'm texting nicolas.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.349
What?

06:57.351 --> 06:59.217
You said you didn't
want him to think you were

06:59.219 --> 07:00.786
Up for a wham-bam,
thank you, mademoiselle.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.388
You're right, max.
I shouldn't text him.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.923
[phone vibrates]

07:04.925 --> 07:07.225
He just texted me again.
What's one drink?

07:07.227 --> 07:10.061
$18.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.230
It is?
Yeah, you better text him.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.100
We need a grown-up
to pay for the drinks.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.270
I'll just say I'm with friends,
and he can join for a drink.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.272
Isn't that what people do?
I forget.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.308
I haven't been a person
or done anything in so long.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.812
Or done a person
in so long.
[laughs]

07:26.814 --> 07:29.047
I won't let it get that far.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.882
And by that I mean you won't.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.084
I'll give you a signal and then
you'll say we have to go.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.521
What's the signal?
Full penetration?

07:39.325 --> 07:41.259
No, before that.

07:41.261 --> 07:45.130
So just the tip?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.708
I think I'll just wink.

08:09.188 --> 08:13.458
So, croquembouche?

08:13.460 --> 08:16.194
I can't pretend to talk.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.231
I hope his tongue
is wearing protection.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.636
Hey.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.438
Are we making you
uncomfortable?

08:26.440 --> 08:29.174
No, no, it's just that
I usually like to fast-forward

08:29.176 --> 08:33.278
Through the kissing parts
when I watch porn.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.881
Come on, relax, max.
We're just having some fun.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.949
It's just that
you're our teacher,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.318
And your spittle
is all over her mouth.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.822
We're not in class.
Do you see batter or bowls?

08:43.824 --> 08:46.691
Well, we're hoping
not to see any balls.

08:48.728 --> 08:53.365
I see the outline
of one of 'em.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.202
Just don't think of me
as a teacher right now.

08:57.204 --> 09:01.740
Well, I'm kind of
learning a lot.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.709
You know, for someone
who wasn't gonna have sex,

09:04.711 --> 09:07.546
She's having sex.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.647
I'm leaving.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.315
I haven't felt this awkward

09:10.317 --> 09:11.917
Since my mom had sex
with my prom date

09:11.919 --> 09:15.220
In the limo
and made me drive.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.589
Your mom sounds cool.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.525
Come on, you can't leave.
We just got here.

09:20.527 --> 09:24.529
Well, she's about to get there,
and I don't wanna see it.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.598
Well, we can make out.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.768
[laughs]
you wanna make out? With me?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.170
[chuckles]
no, a comedy make-out.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.839
You know, like...
[babbling]

09:40.947 --> 09:43.915
Well, you make it look
so tempting.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.951
[laughs] come on,
it'll be hilarious.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.421
Let my mouth be
your tongue's panic room.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.623
And chef nicolas
could use a few pointers.

09:51.625 --> 09:56.528
[moaning]

09:58.898 --> 10:01.866
Yeah, he's really
bad at it.

10:01.868 --> 10:02.867
All right, why not?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.569
It might even
get their attention.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.870
On the count of three.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.405
One, two...

10:07.407 --> 10:10.875
[both babbling]

10:10.877 --> 10:11.876
Did they look?

10:11.878 --> 10:14.479
No, he's busy rounding third.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.480
My turn.

10:15.482 --> 10:18.149
[groaning]

10:18.151 --> 10:19.150
[laughs]

10:19.152 --> 10:21.987
Max, what's happening?

10:23.255 --> 10:26.558
Hey.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.596
[groaning]

10:31.598 --> 10:35.000
He's licking your face.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.267
Leave them alone.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.236
Deke seems to know
what he's doing.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.305
Respect.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.909
Well, hate to comedy
make out and run,

10:44.911 --> 10:48.313
But, well, I'm already
mentally at yummy donuts

10:48.315 --> 10:51.249
Trying to binge eat
this image out of my mind.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.288
Hold on, max. The signal.

10:57.290 --> 11:02.293
See, this is why
I don't do girlfriend.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.896
Come on, we have somewhere to go
or be, something like that.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
Well...

11:08.001 --> 11:13.004
[chuckling, panting]

11:13.006 --> 11:15.140
We have to go.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.508
See you later.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.209
<i>Au revoir.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

11:18.211 --> 11:20.712
[thuds]

11:27.720 --> 11:30.722
'sup?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.524
Not much.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.393
'sup with you?

11:35.395 --> 11:38.129
[phone ringing]

11:38.131 --> 11:41.032
Sorry, I have to get this.
It's my wife.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.035
Hello?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.304
Girrrl...

11:53.546 --> 11:55.714
Oh, I totally forgot
to tell you.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.849
You're terrible
at making out.

11:57.851 --> 12:01.653
Well, I never had
a father to teach me.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.254
[elevator dings]

12:03.256 --> 12:04.556
Hey, big mary.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.493
Hallway lunch.
Love that for you.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.095
And you.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.330
This could've been your
walk of shame right now

12:12.332 --> 12:15.333
If I hadn't
stepped in, winky.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.435
Yes, last night
got a little out of hand.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.038
Oh, it was pretty much
in your hand.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.874
No, it was not, max.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.909
Yes, there might have been
a tasteful graze,

12:24.911 --> 12:27.112
Just to figure out
how european he was down there.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.881
Good news, it's not
wearing a floppy beret.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.951
So we are right on track for
a perfect fairy-tale romance.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.086
Yeah, the princess
and the penis.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.790
See you at the diner, max.
<i>Au revoir, mes amis.</i>

12:38.792 --> 12:41.126
I have to kinda
tell you something

12:41.128 --> 12:43.094
That you have to
promise you kind of

12:43.096 --> 12:44.729
Definitely won't
tell caroline.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.798
Are you about to tell me
that when she speaks french

12:46.800 --> 12:48.133
It makes you want
to slam your head

12:48.135 --> 12:49.734
Through that
plate-glass window too?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.971
Heh. Well, the thing is
he's married.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.640
He's married?
How do you know?

12:55.642 --> 12:58.777
He's not wearing a ring,
and he doesn't seem dead inside.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.079
His wife called him
after you guys left.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.114
How could he do that?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.783
He's french?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.451
And not tell caroline.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.119
He's french?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.387
What a jerk.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.056
Fronch?

13:12.058 --> 13:14.225
I'm telling her right now.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.394
Wait, wait, wait, max,
he'll know it was me.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.097
Can you just wait until after
I turn in my croquembouche?

13:19.099 --> 13:22.300
I'm already on thin ice
with <i>"au bon pain</i> in my ass."

13:22.302 --> 13:24.002
This sucks.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.271
He's married, and caroline
has this weird thing in her head

13:26.273 --> 13:30.708
That she has to marry
someone who isn't married.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.312
<i>Bonjour, bebe. Ca va?</i>

13:34.314 --> 13:36.314
Oh, boy.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.016
I'm not really good
with any languages.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.820
They think it's because
I got hit by three cars.

13:41.822 --> 13:46.024
Fyi, if you ever get hit,
just stay down.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.860
Well, guess what.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.329
I got you and me salads.
Girls' lunch.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.031
Well, I usually just have

13:53.033 --> 13:56.334
Peanut butter and crackers
in the dark.

13:56.336 --> 14:01.039
I hear so much about salad
I've always wanted to try it.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.508
Sure. Sit. Have some salad.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.109
You and me, me and you.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.178
Getting to know
more about each other.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.114
So bebe, tell me
everything about nicolas.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.950
He's the best.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.386
He has the heart
and eyes of a dog.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.723
So nicolas, where
do you think he is?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.625
He just said
he had a lunch date.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.193
Date?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.528
Did he use the word "date,"

14:23.530 --> 14:25.063
Or are you just
using the word "date"?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.798
I mean, it's not like
he's dating anyone.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.299
[chuckles]
is he?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.468
No, why would he
be dating anyone?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
Exactly, why would he
be dating anyone?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.073
Yeah, I mean, he's married.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.242
[spits]

14:37.244 --> 14:38.810
Married?

14:38.812 --> 14:43.448
You know, salad tastes
just like lettuce.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.223
You are not
going to believe this.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.560
Kendall jenner
is applying to colleges?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.996
Come on, max, no.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.699
Nicolas is--and get ready--
married.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.868
I kissed a married man.
I'm so mortified.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.004
Please don't ever tell anyone
I kissed a married man.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.407
Okay, I won't tell anyone.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.675
Tell anyone what?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.610
Caroline kissed
a married man.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.880
But don't tell anyone.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.181
All right, I want
to go on the record

15:17.183 --> 15:18.883
That I didn't know.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.219
Kissing a married man has never
been in my life plan.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.121
It's not on my vision board
or in my dreamscape.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.722
I am not that kind of person.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.925
But she is the kind of person
who has a vision board

15:26.927 --> 15:29.727
And says "dreamscape,"
so let's judge her on that.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.763
I won't judge you, caroline.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.197
I once went out
with a married woman.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.632
I didn't know she was married

15:34.634 --> 15:36.301
Until her spouse came
and beat me up.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.704
Lesbians are strong.

15:42.541 --> 15:46.110
Listen, married, not married,
don't be so american.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.947
You know, in poland,
the wedding vows say,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.049
"do you take this woman...

15:51.051 --> 15:55.620
And maybe some others?"

15:55.622 --> 15:58.222
Well, not polish,
and not a lesbian yet.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.224
So I'm very upset.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.793
And, max, why are you
just standing there?

16:01.795 --> 16:02.827
Why haven't you
said anything?

16:02.829 --> 16:05.096
Eh...

16:05.098 --> 16:07.365
Um...
I kind of knew.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.770
You kind of knew
he was married?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.672
You kind of knew and didn't
kind of tell me?

16:14.674 --> 16:15.907
What kind of friend
are you?

16:15.909 --> 16:17.342
I just found out myself.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.676
Well, then why didn't
you tell me?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.678
I was going to,
but then deke asked me not to

16:20.680 --> 16:22.280
Until he handed in
his homework.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.614
And also I thought
you might cry.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.950
Oh, and you didn't
want to upset me?

16:25.952 --> 16:29.120
Nah, I didn't
want to deal with it.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.022
'cause when you cry,
you don't just cry once.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.657
It's like a six-cry thing.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.659
You've got the first shock cry,
the silent cry,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.527
The ugly cry,
the cry because you're crying,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.262
The cry after you say
you're not gonna cry anymore,

16:38.264 --> 16:42.767
And then the final cry,
which is probably my fault.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.470
Well, you're wrong, max,
I'm not gonna cry over this,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.505
Because I haven't gone
far enough down the road.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.807
Yes, I was just beginning
to think about our future,

16:49.809 --> 16:50.641
But I'm not that invested.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.710
Oh.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.811
Then what's this?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.613
My dupe pad.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.449
That's right. And look what
I found written on the back.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.852
"caroline and nicolas
saintcroix.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.820
"mr. And mrs. Saintcroix.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.722
Caroline saintcroix."

17:04.724 --> 17:07.825
That's just being silly.
Every girl does that.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.228
You're 40.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.398
[elevator dings]

17:13.400 --> 17:14.966
Oh, man, this is heavy.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.634
I know, very heavy.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.969
We're back here,
and I have to deal with the fact

17:17.971 --> 17:22.507
That I was dry-humped
by a married man.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.475
No, I think he meant
his dessert is heavy.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.512
But yeah, you got
a lot going on.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.813
So what do you
want us to do?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.248
Should we throw down?
Mess his ass up?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.016
Kick him in the face?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.819
Or just ignore it so I don't
get kicked out of school?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.422
No, I'll deal
with nicolas later.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.057
You sure?

17:39.059 --> 17:43.061
'cause I've always wanted
to kill a french person.

17:43.063 --> 17:47.265
Again.
[laughs]

17:47.267 --> 17:50.001
Thanks, but stay out of it.
I've got this.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.870
I'm gonna rip him a new one.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.873
Bonjour, caroline.
<i>Bonjour, nicolas.</i>

17:55.875 --> 17:56.874
That wasn't a rip.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.710
Wasn't even a tear.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.712
Go, go, you two.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.015
Got a big, hot bundt here.

18:04.017 --> 18:05.883
Go, go, don't be late.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.752
You sure that's
a croquembouche?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.488
'cause it looks like
a coyote poop tree.
[laughs]

18:12.624 --> 18:13.958
Caroline, can you
watch the phones for me

18:13.960 --> 18:16.194
While I give chef nicolas
this note from his wife?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.728
You know what?
I'll give it to him.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.897
I have something
I have to say to him anyway.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.734
Oh, for next girls' lunch,
have you ever had sandwiches?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.804
'cause I'm thinking
of trying one.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.542
[knocks]

18:31.544 --> 18:33.611
Not you.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.815
You have got this.
You have got this.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.650
You broke up
with a kennedy cousin.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.119
You can do this.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.154
Caroline,
do you need something?

18:43.156 --> 18:46.591
I just wanted to give you
this phone message you just got.

18:46.593 --> 18:50.461
From your wife.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.997
From your wife.
Juliette.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.833
I know her name.
You're married.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.904
Yes, you just got
a message from my wife.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.508
I feel like something's getting
lost in the translation here,

19:03.510 --> 19:06.777
So let me be clear.
It's over between us.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.481
Why?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.683
Why?
Because you're married.

19:12.685 --> 19:16.120
Again, I know that.
But why?

19:16.122 --> 19:18.956
What--what do
you mean "why"?

19:18.958 --> 19:23.694
Why? Because you are married.
Vous est marie!

19:23.696 --> 19:26.497
And note, I did not
use    <i>"t</i>because we are

19:26.499 --> 19:29.700
Back on the more formal
"vous" terms.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.603
Look, caroline,
my wife is in France,

19:32.605 --> 19:34.805
And we have
an understanding.

19:34.807 --> 19:38.476
Well, I'm having a hard time
understanding any of this.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.511
And whatever arrangement
you and juliette have,

19:40.513 --> 19:41.846
It's over
between you and me.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.416
Here.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.020
You are very cute
when you're angry.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.022
I am?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.857
Actually, you are very cute
all the time.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.992
Cute and sexy.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.128
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to...

19:57.130 --> 19:58.696
Put my lips onto yours.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.298
You did?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.999
Yes.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.703
Caroline, you are a smart,
sexy, delicious woman.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.205
And now that I've kissed--

20:07.207 --> 20:08.873
Do you have something
in your eye?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.708
No, no, no, no, no.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.711
[knocks]

20:13.713 --> 20:16.247
It's never you!

20:18.850 --> 20:20.184
I'm sorry, what is happening?

20:20.186 --> 20:22.887
Chef nicolas, uh, you need
to get back in there

20:22.889 --> 20:24.422
Because the chef
with the neck tattoo

20:24.424 --> 20:26.324
Is trying to pass off
a store-bought tiramisu.

20:26.326 --> 20:31.062
There is one every year.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.597
Caroline.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.667
Are you okay?
What did he say?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.169
He said he's married,
and it's confusing,

20:38.171 --> 20:40.338

No drama, no more crying.
