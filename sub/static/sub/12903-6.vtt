00:02.469 --> 00:04.203
Okay, Mr. Fibonacci,

00:04.205 --> 00:07.806
let's see how we did
with your hair transplant.

00:09.810 --> 00:13.245
I think you're gonna be
very happy.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.715
Wow.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.051
This is fantastic.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.387
Thank you, doctor.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.721
You're very welcome.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.456
Good luck
fighting the girls off.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.326
Hey, doc, just a sec.

00:27.328 --> 00:32.398
I have a little pain
in... in my side.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.532
That's odd.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.567
Have you had a kidney removed
lately?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.136
I don't think so.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.338
My wife usually handles
that stuff.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.206
Yeah, well, you know what?
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.209
I mean, I might call the cops
and report an organ theft,

00:44.211 --> 00:45.878
but just to be totally safe.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.746
Will do. All right, thanks, doc.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.815
You bet.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.678 --> 01:20.245
Stay with me, Tribeca.
Is she gonna be okay?

01:20.247 --> 01:22.548
No,
she's definitely going to die.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.916
Will you marry me?

01:23.918 --> 01:26.585
I said I'm going in!
I'm going in!

01:26.587 --> 01:29.188
I'm going in!

01:30.925 --> 01:34.126
Angie.
Come to the other side, Angie.

01:34.128 --> 01:37.196
Sergeant Pepper? Where are you?

01:37.198 --> 01:38.630
I'm here.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.965
Where?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.134
Hi, Angie.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.802
I...

01:43.804 --> 01:45.270
Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop!

01:45.272 --> 01:46.939
Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop!
Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.307
Nurse!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.111
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

01:52.113 --> 01:54.046
What are you doing here?

01:54.048 --> 01:55.781
What am I doing here?
I'm your husband.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.717
We moved in together after they fit
all the brains back in your head.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.621
Looks like
someone needs his mommy.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.822
Tribeca.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.158
I'll be right there.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.362
You wanted to see us, sir?

02:43.364 --> 02:46.265
I need you two
to get over to the hospital.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.700
Somebody's stealing organs.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.136
Do we know who?
It would save a lot of time.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.372
I'm afraid not.
But we better find out

02:53.374 --> 02:56.208
before the mayor opens his
new cancer research wing.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.044
After his campaign manager
turned out to be a murderer,

02:59.046 --> 03:02.214
he's desperate for anything
to boost his approval ratings.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.484
So he opens a cancer wing to
appease the anti-cancer voters.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.786
I know, Tribeca.
It's a cynical time.

03:07.788 --> 03:11.390
Now, because of the very
specific nature of the case,

03:11.392 --> 03:15.727
the department has assigned a
romance novelist to advise you.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.498
Her thoughts may seem whimsical
and pointless at first,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.568
but in the end, you'll realize
she was right all along.

03:22.570 --> 03:27.072
Geils, Tribeca,
Miss Jackie Wilder.

03:30.678 --> 03:35.581
I'll never forget you,
my succulent, rippling man lion.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.482
And I'll never forget you,

03:37.484 --> 03:40.586
chick I met on the elevator
30 seconds ago.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.388
Hello, detectives.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.657
I'm very much looking forward
to working with...

03:45.659 --> 03:47.526
Wait a second.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.194
You two are in love.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.530
What? That's ridiculous.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.565
Don't tell a tale
to a tale teller.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.601
It's the oldest story
in the world.

03:55.603 --> 03:59.738
Girl cop gets boy partner,
boy falls in love with girl,

03:59.740 --> 04:03.108
girl explodes
and falls in a year-long coma.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.776
You couldn't be more wrong.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.279
You should stick to
writing novels, Ms. Wilder.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.549
You. Your story's written
all over your face.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.084
Poor family.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.785
Ran away with a circus
for a better life.

04:13.787 --> 04:19.257
11 long, hard years of riding
the rails as a strongman.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.794
I bet you're still sending money
home to Romania, kid?

04:25.966 --> 04:29.968
And you. You are a lover.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.572
A man of passion and romance.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.708
I see you dead in a boating
accident in 16 months.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.278
Damn it.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.384
Scholls.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.585
Tribeca.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.153
Ooh, cozy.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.621
What are we looking at, Scholls?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.922
Wait a minute.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.824
You two...

04:52.826 --> 04:54.993
Patient went in for
a routine hair transplant,

04:54.995 --> 04:56.295
came out missing a kidney.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.096
Anything point to who did this?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.498
We won't know
until we cut him open.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.733
I'm sorry, until you what?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.302
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to keep quiet.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.970
This is a crime scene.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.239
Here, put a little bit of this
under your nose for the smell.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.341
Thank you.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.845
Sir, I'm
not gonna ask you again.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.149
Yeah. Whoever did this
had medical training.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.018
You can see here and here where
they clamped the blood supply,

05:20.020 --> 05:21.753
and look at the suture knot.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.021
This was no butcher.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.856
This was a crime of passion.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.325
Someone did this for love.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.293
Actually, Jackie, we find that,
generally,

05:28.295 --> 05:30.996
organ theft is a crime
for money and profit.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.865
Really, Detective Tribeca?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.367
Is that what you find?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.035
Well, let me tell you
what <i> I</i> find.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.138
I find that it's very tough
for you to be back in a hospital

05:40.140 --> 05:42.341
after what happened to you.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.010
The sounds, the smells.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.046
They bring back
a flood of memories.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.283
Year of life... gone.

05:51.285 --> 05:54.886
A year that could have been.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.489
Aching in your loins.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.790
Hey.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.526
I've had bad loins
since I was a kid.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.863
We should have a word with
the chief of the hospital.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.733
Let's start with "hello"
and then go from there.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.469
Nothing happens in this hospital
that I don't know about.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.037
So, who do you think
is stealing organs?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.405
Someone is stealing organs?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.340
We have to put a stop to that
immediately.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.909
Are you aware this is
the only hospital in Los Angeles

06:17.911 --> 06:19.244
that turns a profit?

06:19.246 --> 06:21.213
I don't think I like
what you are insinuating.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.548
Yes, we make money.
We do it honestly.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.251
We gouge the patients
in their most vulnerable time.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.253
Can I have another blanket,
please?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.555
Yes, of course you can.
I will get it myself.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.857
2 grand.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.692
We're gonna need a list
of the nurses and doctors

06:33.694 --> 06:35.427
who were present
during those surgeries.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.862
I'd be happy to help,

06:36.864 --> 06:39.398
but there would be
some small processing fees.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.699
How about this...

06:40.701 --> 06:43.235
You give us a list,
or you go to jail.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.103
You'll like it. It's free.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.607
Socialist.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.111
Hey, are you okay?
You look a bit tired.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.881
I haven't been sleeping much.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.182
Angie Tribeca?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.450
Nurse Lowboobs.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.752
How you doing
since the coma, baby?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.754
We were so worried about you.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.689
I feel much better, thanks.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.259
And where's that cute guy that used
to come and visit you every day?

07:07.261 --> 07:09.928
He's right here.
Detective Geils.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.097
No, not him. Another man.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.966
Scruffier. More of a movie guy.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.302
It sounds like you're describing
Eddie Pepper,

07:17.304 --> 07:20.772
but that's impossible
because he... he...

07:20.774 --> 07:24.376
Disappeared under
mysterious circumstances?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.746
It was just a dream.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.047
Was it?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.449
I don't know anymore.

07:30.451 --> 07:33.485
I think you do.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.723
He's out, Dr. Brainerd.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.592
Thank you, Dr. Stein. Scalpel.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.594
So, did you notice
anything unusual

07:42.596 --> 07:44.896
during Mr. Fibonacci's
hair transplant?

07:44.898 --> 07:47.899
No, no. It was totally routine.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.568
Would someone mop my brow?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.837
Of course, doctor.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.007
Have you seen this kidney?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.510
Gross.
Why would you show me that?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.579
Because this kidney went missing

08:00.581 --> 08:02.747
from your patient
during your surgery.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.785
Sorry, Dr. Stein.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.420
Nurse Barton, try to be
a little more careful.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.188
I remember
he said something about that.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.857
Would someone rub my shoulders,
please?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.458
Of course, doctor.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.026
Come on, more pressure.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.595
Applying more pressure.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.331
Okay. All righty.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
I'm ready for the new hair.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.102
Thank you.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.670
Stapler.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.842
You know, I wouldn't
even have the expertise

08:30.844 --> 08:32.110
to remove a kidney.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.179
I was booted out
of surgical rotation

08:34.181 --> 08:37.048
because of my phobia
of internal organs.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.783
See?

08:38.784 --> 08:41.720
Organophobic.
His story checks out.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.689
Nurse, would you finish up,
please?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.892
Of course.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.567
So, what you're saying is
you're nowhere.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.968
Just remember,

08:56.970 --> 09:00.205
you can't spell "nowhere"
without "now" and "here."

09:00.207 --> 09:02.307
Lieutenant, can you take
this woman off our case?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.742
She's incredibly irritating.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.977
Why don't you let me worry
about who's on the case

09:05.979 --> 09:08.213
and you worry about shutting
down the organ pipeline

09:08.215 --> 09:10.215
before the mayor's
ribbon cutting.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.183
Wait a minute.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.818
Pipeline.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.087
Pipeline. That's it.
Pipelines have two ends.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.056
If we can't figure out
how the organs are coming in,

09:18.058 --> 09:21.159
maybe we can figure out
where they're coming out.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.994
The black market.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.163
In my fifth novel,
"Passion Feast,"

09:25.165 --> 09:27.165
the heroine bought all her
handbags on the black market

09:27.167 --> 09:28.667
in hopes of convincing Thomas

09:28.669 --> 09:30.902
that she was an heiress
instead of a shop girl.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.171
But what she didn't know is

09:33.173 --> 09:36.341
that Thomas was only
a cobbler's son.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.244
Of course. The black market.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.546
Tanner, what do you know
about the black market?

09:41.548 --> 09:43.415
Why are you asking me?

09:43.417 --> 09:45.383
No reason.
I just thought you might know.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.685
Why would I know?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.753
Because you're a detective
with experience on the streets.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.455
So, why didn't you ask Tribeca?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.791
Because I can't tell if she has
experience on the streets or not.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.926
I know he doesn't.

09:54.928 --> 09:59.431
I have some.
On my father's side.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.602
Boy, that was uncomfortable.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.036
Excuse me, Ms. Wilder.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.805
Would you mind signing my copy
of your third novel,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.306
"A Confusing Promise"?

10:08.308 --> 10:12.377
I will, but there's something
I need to do first.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.750
There. That's better.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.152
Now, who should I
make it out to?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.955
Monica Scholls.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.459
Enjoy.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.398
"Dear Monica,
the baby you're raising"

10:33.400 --> 10:36.134
was not born out of
a Canadian love tryst.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.303
Keep dancing
like no one's watching.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.438
"Jackie Wilder."

10:55.956 --> 10:58.390
Hit "basement," please.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.179
Ding.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.648
No, no, this is only 2.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.456
Firearms!
Get those untraceable firearms!

11:31.458 --> 11:34.459
Cigarettes!
Non-electric cigarettes!

11:34.461 --> 11:37.896
Quaaludes! Vintage Quaaludes!

11:37.898 --> 11:40.632
Grenade sample?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.973
Can you tell us where we can
find the illegal organs?

11:48.975 --> 11:51.643
There's a guy just over there.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.311
Best organs in town.

11:58.218 --> 12:02.220
Well, hello, Nurse Barton.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.691
We should go pick her up.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.929
Can we look just for
a second, just for fun?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.764
Now, we discussed this.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.667
You're right.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.843
Nurse Barton.

12:24.845 --> 12:29.414
Does that hurt,
when I use that name, "nurse"?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.250
Your parents had all these
hopes and dreams for you,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.586
and all you could
become is a nurse.

12:34.588 --> 12:40.592
The lowest of the low,
contributing nothing to society.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.527
A parasite.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.795
Take it easy, Tribeca.

12:43.797 --> 12:47.265
I think it's amazing
that you became a nurse.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.567
I definitely feel safer
with him.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.736
Just tell me, sweetheart.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.471
Tell me how you got the kidney.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.473
I told you.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.475
After the doctor left,

12:57.477 --> 13:01.279
I made an incision,
and I took the kidney out.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.483
You're a lying whore!
Who is she?

13:05.485 --> 13:08.086
She's a romance novelist
who's working the case with us.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.656
Okay, so you're doing good
cop/bad cop/romance novelist?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.658
Believe me, not by choice.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.494
There's no way she has the surgical
training to remove a kidney.

13:16.496 --> 13:20.331
You remember in my fourth novel,
"Open Wide, Say"

13:20.333 --> 13:22.000
an orderly is charged

13:22.002 --> 13:24.169
for overdosing patients
with morphine

13:24.171 --> 13:28.173
until they realize he has
no idea how to start an I.V.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.609
She's protecting the person who
did this because she loves him.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.144
Or her.

13:33.146 --> 13:37.982
You remember my second novel,
"Summer Scissor Sisters."

13:37.984 --> 13:39.317
We'll have the judge
go easy on you

13:39.319 --> 13:40.852
if you tell us
who you're working with.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.987
It was just me alone.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.690
I see. He's married.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.260
And you think he's gonna
leave her for you.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.365
Take it from me, sweetheart.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.434
They never leave.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.705
I have nothing more to say.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.940
Here.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.546
She's protecting someone in that
hospital... someone she loves.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.217
But she confessed.
Lock her up, throw away the key.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.552
I'll call the mayor, tell him he's
clear to open up the cancer wing.

14:14.554 --> 14:18.156
We get cancer, we go there, they
treat us, everybody's happy.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.458
I don't know, Lieutenant. I
don't think she did it, either.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.827
So, now everybody we lock up
has to have done it?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.963
Tribeca, what do you think?

14:24.965 --> 14:29.167
I hate to say it, but,
Jackie Wilder's right.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.902
I agree.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.904
Whoever did this
is still out there.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.739
There's only one way
to draw them out.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.908
Geils does surgery...

14:36.910 --> 14:38.576
on me.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.412
Tribeca, for God's sake, you
know about your fear of comas.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.548
Let me be the patient,
you be the doctor.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.384
If I'm ever gonna put this fear
behind me,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.987
I got to go back under.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.891
But everyone heard me volunteer,
right?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.097
Hold on a second, Dr. Stein.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.032
You're gonna be okay.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.834
I know. I trust you.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.770
But be on the lookout for anybody
trying to take my organs.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.006
Copy that.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.509
All right, let's get started.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.281
Sharp cutty thing.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.516
Ooh.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.618
Right through the glove.
Shit, that hurt.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.220
Okay, here we go.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.456
Concentrating, concentrating.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.892
Geils, can I talk to you
for a second?

15:27.894 --> 15:29.994
Yeah, sure, what's up?

15:34.234 --> 15:37.101
Our son, Angela,
who's his mother?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.470
That really important,
who's his mother?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.206
Do people really care
who their mom is?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.975
In my family, it's a tradition.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.910
It was some Canadian chick
I slept with

15:45.912 --> 15:47.912
who I've never spoken to again.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.480
What part of that
doesn't make sense?

15:49.482 --> 15:53.451
As far as I'm concerned,
you're Angie's mother.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.919
Case closed.

15:54.921 --> 15:59.123
Case reopened
based on new evidence.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.495
Yeah, that's pretty damning.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.232
Monica, I'm sorry.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.136
Goodbye, Geils.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.006
Come on, don't do the walk-away.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.012
Where's my scalpel?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.348
Where's Dr. Stein?

16:26.419 --> 16:29.187
My God.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.456
Angie, you're gonna be okay,
you hear me?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.691
I'm gonna find your kidney, and
I'm gonna put it back inside you,

16:33.693 --> 16:36.294
and everything's gonna be okay
because I love you.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.997
And that thing with me
and Scholls, it's over.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.433
I broke it off
no matter what she says.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.103
It's you and me all the way,
baby.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.506
He's never gonna leave her,
is he?

16:49.275 --> 16:51.642
It's Dr. Stein,
the anesthesiologist.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.645
He takes the organs, and I sell
them on the black market.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.714
It's a profit scheme.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.716
I'm so proud of you.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.586
I'm proud of all of you,
because in the end...

17:17.069 --> 17:19.436
Dr. Stein, hold the elevator.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.808
Thanks so much.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.380
Angie.
Come to the other side, Angie.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.250
Sergeant Pepper? Where are you?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.684
I'm here.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.253
Where?

17:35.255 --> 17:37.088
Marco?

17:37.090 --> 17:39.090
Rubio.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.204
Boop!

17:53.206 --> 17:55.406
Boop! Boop!

17:55.408 --> 17:58.076
Hi there.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.011
Sergeant Pepper.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.280
Angie.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.749
Angie. Angie.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.050
Angie.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.686
What happened?
Did they take my kidney?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.355
Yes, but I found it,
and I put it back in.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.392
Angie, we did it.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.427
You conquered your fear
of comas,

18:16.429 --> 18:19.430
and I conquered my fear
of performing surgery.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.965
Thanks, Geils.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.468
So, I told you this when
you were unconscious,

18:23.470 --> 18:25.103
but Scholls and I...

18:25.105 --> 18:28.072
And this was completely
my decision... we broke up.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.707
I'm sorry.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.609
I think it really bothered her

18:31.611 --> 18:33.611
that I lied about
who I had the baby with.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.213
Women are complicated.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.647
Anyway, I'm kind of hoping...

18:36.649 --> 18:40.284
Geils, I think I have to
find some things out first.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.320
Yeah. Sure.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.889
Of... of course.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.257
What things?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.992
It's kind of personal.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.827
Okay. I get that.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.265
Can I know?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.800
No. No.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.903
Thanks for putting
my kidney back.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.105
I'll think about you
every time I pee.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.740
Yo.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.843
Jackie Wilder's new book just
came out based on this case.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.880
Check it out.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.084
I am so excited
to cut the ribbon

19:13.086 --> 19:17.021
for the Joe Perry Center for
Weird Moles and Worrisome Lumps.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.191
It is my dream
to one day cure cancer

19:20.193 --> 19:21.692
so that, once again,

19:21.694 --> 19:25.596
we may all enjoy the pleasures
of smoking and drinking.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.803
Hey, Nurse Lowboobs?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.172
What is it, Sugar?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.440
I was wondering if I could see
the visitors log

19:36.442 --> 19:37.775
from when I was in a coma.

19:37.777 --> 19:42.146
Sure, yeah. I got it right here.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.048
Thanks.
