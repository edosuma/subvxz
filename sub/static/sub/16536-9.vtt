WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:02.961
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.087 --> 00:04.880
<i>It's the man who killed Majid Nassar.</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:07.216
I think the people who did this
are trying to make Jason do something.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.801
You have an hour. After that,

00:08.926 --> 00:11.220
you'll either find your son
safe at home... or not.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.639
I killed Majid Nassar.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.809
The deputy director of the FBI
killed the most wanted terrorist?

00:16.934 --> 00:17.893
I'm afraid so.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.312
Cheer up, Peter. You're about
to be a heartbeat away.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.314
Assuming you make it to V.P.,

00:22.440 --> 00:24.066
when I take Kirkman down,

00:24.191 --> 00:25.985
I'll make sure
I don't leave you behind.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.486
<i>11:14 p.m.</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:28.654
<i>- Look into it.</i>
- Wait.

01:49.527 --> 01:52.363
<i>Madam Speaker, congratulations
on your new position.</i>

01:52.488 --> 01:53.906
<i>Let me start by asking,</i>

01:54.031 --> 01:55.825
<i>do you, like your colleagues
in the Senate,</i>

01:55.950 --> 01:59.203
<i>view these confirmation hearings
as anything more than a formality?</i>

01:59.328 --> 02:00.913
<i>Tom Kirkman is our president</i>

02:01.038 --> 02:02.915
<i>because he wasn't
at the State of the Union.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:05.876
<i>Peter MacLeish is a hero
because he lived through it.</i>

02:06.001 --> 02:09.045
<i>Certainly, survival shouldn't be
the only qualification</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:11.757
<i>when it comes to leading
our country, should it?</i>

02:11.882 --> 02:14.051
She's intimidated by you.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.888
She's done everything from <i>Megyn Kelly</i>
to <i>Jimmy Kimmel.</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:21.559
"Intimidated" isn't the word
that comes to mind.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.854
162 Independents
in the new house.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.230
How can she read that

02:26.355 --> 02:28.399
as anything other than
America's endorsement

02:28.524 --> 02:30.734
of their first Independent president?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.862
Trust me. She'll find a way.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.951
<i>Madam Speaker, what do you hope to learn
from Congressman MacLeish's testimony?</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:41.912
Has she done any irrevocable damage
to our nominee this morning?

02:42.037 --> 02:45.958
No, just continuing her never-ending
quest to cast doubt on his qualifications.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.461
She'd be better off taking a cue from
the Senate. They made it perfectly clear.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.589
No one wants to play politics
with this confirmation.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.049
I wish I saw her face
when the vote came back unanimous.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.552
You think steam can actually
come out of someone's ears?

02:57.219 --> 02:58.596
You remembered my order.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.557
Double Americano. Three pumps vanilla,
one pump caramel.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.726
It's too ridiculous to forget.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.063
Hey.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.815
Why are you so calm?
Don't you check your e-mail?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.442
Not in the last 45 seconds. Why?

03:11.567 --> 03:12.818
A security breach.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.988
All right, let's get the NSA Director
on the phone. I want the full story

03:16.113 --> 03:18.032
- before we notify the president.
- Let's go.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.754
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.464
They've been digging through
Atwood's office all morning.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.175
- You know what's going on?
- It's an internal review.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.094
Why is Atwood being investigated?
How do you know that's what's happening?

03:39.220 --> 03:43.265
Because here comes the Director
of Internal Affairs, John Foerstel.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.392
Agent Wells. Hi.

03:45.768 --> 03:46.977
A word?

03:47.811 --> 03:51.023
- His name is Gabriel Thompson.
- He worked as a systems analyst

03:51.148 --> 03:53.275
for the National Security Agency
for the last 20 years.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.277
And yesterday he just
walked out the front door

03:55.402 --> 03:57.947
- with a ton of classified information?
- Which this morning the NSA is calling

03:58.072 --> 03:59.698
- a "significant breach."
- How significant?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.867
Well, the prototype hard drive
Thompson took

04:01.992 --> 04:04.036
is capable of storing terabytes of files.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.788
NSA estimates it'll take days

04:05.913 --> 04:07.873
to comb through the system
and assess the stolen data.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.625
Luckily, the press
hasn't gotten wind of that.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.502
Only a matter of time
before that happens.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.545
Agreed. What do we know
about this Thompson?

04:13.671 --> 04:16.130
I mean, is this espionage?
Is a foreign government involved?

04:16.257 --> 04:17.382
Well, it's uncertain, sir.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.885
NSA's throwing all their resources
into tracking him down.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.304
And Whitaker promised to brief you
as soon as he knows more.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.014
We need to get ahead of this now.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.309
It's nice to see you,
Agent Wells. It's been a while.

04:27.434 --> 04:31.021
Well, John, in your line of work,
that's generally considered a good thing.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.189
Hm.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.359
Look, I know that you were close
with Jason Atwood,

04:35.484 --> 04:38.570
but it's a friendship
that could cause problems for you.

04:38.696 --> 04:39.697
Why?

04:39.822 --> 04:41.907
- Am I under investigation, too?
- Come on.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.535
You're smart enough to know
that you're wrapped up in this.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.079
You were with Jason at the prison
when Nassar was murdered, you were

04:47.204 --> 04:49.373
- with him during the interrogation.
- What is the point of this?

04:49.498 --> 04:51.750
You of all people know
that Jason's not a murderer.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.044
Well, I can't exactly
ignore a confession.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.839
If this was so cut-and-dry,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.216
why are you doing
an investigation at all?

05:00.676 --> 05:02.469
All right, I'll bite.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.473
If Jason Atwood
didn't kill Majid Nassar, who did?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.104
You're not doing yourself
any favors, Hannah.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.149
And I know you'd rather answer
my questions than a federal prosecutor's.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.943
Wow.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.945
- We used to be on the same side.
- Yeah.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.281
And we still would be
if you and Jason had ever learned

05:22.406 --> 05:24.950
how to play by the rules
like I warned you two years ago.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.702
Instead, here we are.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.080
Oh, and, Hannah,

05:30.914 --> 05:33.625
I'm paying Jason
a visit this afternoon.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.252
Your stories better match.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.218
Hello?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.970
<i>Hey, Chuck,
think you can get</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:47.306
<i>the Peter MacLeish vetting files
out of the RMD</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:50.059
<i>- and meet me at my house in 20 minutes?</i>
- Yes.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.729
<i>But, Hannah, what the hell's going on?</i>

05:53.854 --> 05:56.023
I'll explain when you get there.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.818
You brought Emily coffee?
You never bring me coffee.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.487
- What do you want, Seth?
- Majid Nassar.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.822
- He's still dead, right?
- Remember when I told you

06:03.947 --> 06:05.282
the press was gonna want answers

06:05.407 --> 06:07.493
on who killed the most-wanted
terrorist in U.S. history?

06:07.618 --> 06:09.119
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm telling you they want answers.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.288
- You got to hold them off, Seth.
- And when I can't?

06:11.413 --> 06:14.333
When the <i>Post</i> runs an op-ed
or the <i>Times</i> accuses us of a cover-up?

06:14.458 --> 06:16.293
Listen, POTUS is meeting
with the FBI today.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.504
Just buy us some time
to get the answers we need.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.839
- If you do, coffee for you next time.
- All right.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.342
Hey, look at this. Gabriel Thompson
just dumped a massive amount

06:23.467 --> 06:24.676
of government documents on WikiLeaks.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.096
Seriously? WikiLeaks?
Isn't that, like, a whistleblower clichÃ©?

06:27.221 --> 06:30.015
Not when the docs are all linked
to members of the previous administration.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.016
Which Kirkman served in.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.643
<i>Material continues</i>

06:32.768 --> 06:35.854
<i>to be released via WikiLeaks
involving questionable activities</i>

06:35.979 --> 06:38.816
<i>by members of
President Richmond's cabinet.</i>

06:38.941 --> 06:40.818
<i>It appears that
several cabinet members</i>

06:40.943 --> 06:42.361
<i>were abusing their power</i>

06:42.486 --> 06:44.196
<i>by receiving money
in exchange for access.</i>

06:44.321 --> 06:45.447
<i>Travel doc--</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:48.367
Okay, so he's claiming
that Richmond's cabinet was corrupt.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.661
I guess we can take espionage
off the list.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.664
- How bad is it?
- It looks a lot worse than it is, sir.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.374
Yeah, pay-for-play
sort of things, mostly.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.501
The Treasury Secretary
was paid to give speeches

06:57.626 --> 06:59.294
at corporate retreats
for banking CEOs.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.338
Commerce Secretary
took overseas research trips

07:01.463 --> 07:03.006
paid for by foreign lobby groups.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.467
The optics are terrible,
but it's not exactly high crimes.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.553
But they are crimes, right?

07:07.678 --> 07:09.638
Counsel's office says yes,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.348
but so far the blow-back's been minimal,

07:11.473 --> 07:13.225
and most of the people
that he's referencing

07:13.350 --> 07:14.852
died during the Capitol bombing.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.812
Everyone but me.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.564
And that's a problem, sir.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.815
Why? What did he say?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.233
Well, that's exactly it.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.193
Your files haven't been released.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.571
- Why would he hold my files back?
- Maybe it's a strategy.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.907
He's waiting till the press is in a frenzy
so he has the whole country's attention.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.409
Look, I-I hate to ask,

07:30.534 --> 07:32.077
but if we're gonna get hit,

07:32.202 --> 07:34.079
we need to know how to respond.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.707
And Mr. President,
do you have anything to hide?

07:45.466 --> 07:48.051
Do I have anything to hide?

07:48.177 --> 07:50.888
I'm sorry to ask, Mr. President,
but we just want to protect you.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.683
I appreciate that, Aaron.
No, I have nothing to hide. No secrets.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.059
Is it possible that he knows about

07:56.185 --> 07:58.103
- Leo's paternity question?
- It's a non-story.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.189
They'd find that out
as quickly as Lisa Jordan did.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.107
Maybe he knows we're sitting
on the Atwood confession.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.401
I've been getting hit from
some national newspaper guys.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.069
We're not sitting on anything.
We're investigating.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.280
As soon as we have answers,
so will the American people.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.782
So why would
this so-called whistleblower

08:10.908 --> 08:14.119
release every cabinet member's
tax returns, their banking records,

08:14.244 --> 08:16.121
except yours?

08:16.246 --> 08:17.456
Look, we can speculate all day

08:17.581 --> 08:19.791
on what Mr. Thompson thinks
he might have on me.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.627
The truth is we need to find him.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.629
Until the NSA knows exactly
what he's stolen,

08:23.754 --> 08:26.798
- he's a threat to our national security.
- All right, sir, we'll stay on top of it,

08:26.924 --> 08:28.425
- keep you posted.
- Thank you.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.640
Let me get this straight.
You're saying that Peter MacLeish,

08:34.765 --> 08:36.975
the guy about to be confirmed
as vice president,

08:37.100 --> 08:39.977
is somehow involved in the conspiracy
that destroyed the Capitol.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.898
I know. It's a lot to process.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.567
My parents' divorce
was a lot to process.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.278
This is next-level, Hannah.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.493
I don't know, but it's also hard to ignore
when you lay it all out like this.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.412
Here's the problem.
Foerstel's already suspicious of me.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.790
But I can't back off MacLeish. Not now.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.335
I need hard evidence against him,
but the only evidence I have right now--

09:03.460 --> 09:05.837
I know. I know. 11:14 p.m.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.506
Right.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.008
I looked everywhere.
I've got nothing.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.469
Right, which is why you need
to re-examine MacLeish's files

09:12.594 --> 09:14.429
and see if there's a connection.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.979
Chuck, I know
you're taking a risk by being here,

09:22.104 --> 09:24.439
so if you needed to leave,
I'd understand.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.527
Hannah, when you come asking for help,
it's never easy,

09:28.652 --> 09:30.654
and sometimes not even legal.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.826
But you're smart and dedicated
and usually right,

09:35.951 --> 09:37.744
so tell me what I need to do.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.373
To be honest,
I'm not comfortable

09:41.498 --> 09:43.000
going after the "Miracle on the Potomac"

09:43.125 --> 09:45.210
just because you've got a bone to pick
with the president.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.795
Congressman, you're new here.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.047
So let me give you
a little bit of free advice.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.383
D.C. is all about relationships.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.343
And this relationship, yours and mine,

09:53.468 --> 09:55.220
is not one you want to sour.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.140
This is a confirmation,
not a coronation.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.559
It's not our job to give the president
what he wants.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.353
Our job is to determine
what's best for the country.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.771
Yes, ma'am.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.358
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll see you inside.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.071
Congressman, Mrs. MacLeish.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.407
Kimble, I hope
you're not too easy on him today.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.242
I'm so glad I ran into you.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.495
I would have hated starting the day
without wishing you the best of luck.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.539
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.210
Congresswoman.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.881
Do you mind if I ask

10:31.006 --> 10:32.841
what it is you have
against Kirkman and myself?

10:34.676 --> 10:38.305
I don't trust anyone who has things
handed to them in life...

10:40.182 --> 10:41.391
Especially power.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.191
11:14 p.m.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.610
I got nothing here, Hannah.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.279
I know it sounds crazy,
but my source was right about room 105.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.240
She was right about MacLeish,
so there's got to be something to this.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.952
I thought that I would find those numbers
on some of the time stamps on these files.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.206
What if it's not a time?
I mean, what if it's a date?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.457
Look at this.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.542
This is the after-action report

11:07.668 --> 11:10.170
that earned him the Bronze Star
in Afghanistan.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.258
November 14, 2005.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.262
11:14 p.m.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.056
P.M...

11:21.181 --> 11:22.891
- Peter MacLeish.
- Peter MacLeish.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.894
Okay.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.648
Okay, but this document
isn't exactly a smoking gun.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.066
MacLeish's unit was attacked
by the Taliban,

11:31.191 --> 11:32.943
and he managed to save most of his men.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.987
I mean, this report's an endorsement
of his bravery and heroism.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.241
Yes, but room 105, at a first glance,
didn't look like a bomb shelter, did it?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.786
You think his file isn't telling you
the whole story?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.330
I think that I'd like to hear
from the men who were there,

11:45.455 --> 11:47.082
whether they saw things
the same way.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.001
<i>To be the only survivor
of the Capitol bombing,</i>

11:50.127 --> 11:52.254
<i>I know, does not qualify me
for higher office,</i>

11:52.379 --> 11:53.672
<i>but when President Kirkman...</i>

11:53.797 --> 11:54.840
MacLeish is crushing it.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.968
- This guy was made for TV.
- I know. If we don't wrap this up today,

11:58.093 --> 12:00.345
you can go hard after Hookstraten
for holding it up.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.764
I mean, public opinion will
definitely be in our favor.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.811
Another dump on WikiLeaks.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.772
Congressional memos, e-mails,
legislative briefings.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.023
Doesn't look like
anything on Kirkman.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.525
No, nothing here can touch him.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.484
That's not true.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.113
Have you seen the leaked memo
on Senator Hazelton?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.866
The country would've been
better off if he'd stayed retired.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.534
Might be true,
but his office just called.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.704
We just pissed off the one man
in Washington we can't afford to piss off.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.456
How did <i>we</i> piss him off?

12:32.836 --> 12:33.962
Senator Hazelton?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.714
He retired
at the end of last term.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.340
He came back
after the Capitol bombing

12:37.466 --> 12:39.384
when the governor of Vermont
appointed him.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.137
And just named the new chair
of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.055
The senator has tremendous power.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.517
His committee can lock down
any debt, tax, spending bill we suggest.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.728
And what about the memo
was so offensive?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.355
"Senator Hazelton
is a lecherous old man

12:52.481 --> 12:54.357
more accustomed
to groping female staff

12:54.483 --> 12:55.692
than promoting them."

12:55.817 --> 12:58.028
Again, why is this my problem?

12:58.153 --> 13:00.739
Because he wants you
to fire the author immediately.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.199
Okay, who's the author?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.204
I am, sir.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.258
Senator, please understand

13:20.383 --> 13:24.429
that my words are in no way a reflection
of how the president feels about you.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.600
That was written years ago,
long before I even met the president.

13:28.725 --> 13:33.730
I sincerely apologize
for embarrassing you in any way.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.901
And you think that's enough?

13:39.402 --> 13:41.446
Senator, I know you want me
to fire Ms. Rhodes,

13:41.571 --> 13:44.282
but I've known Emily
for many years.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.284
And I can tell you
her apology is sincere.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.621
Oh, she means it all right.
Now. When she's scared.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.123
She had a whole different attitude
when she first wrote that smear,

13:52.249 --> 13:54.584
back when she was a nobody,
a jumped-up little House staffer,

13:54.709 --> 13:58.129
and I was finance chairman,
served in two cabinets,

13:58.255 --> 14:00.131
elected to six consecutive terms.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.633
Again, Senator,
I hear what you're saying.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.094
I'm just trying to find us
a way to move forward.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.598
Mr. President, I came out
of retirement to serve again

14:08.723 --> 14:10.642
because my country needed me.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.727
I just helped your nominee,
Peter MacLeish,

14:12.853 --> 14:15.772
through a speedy Senate confirmation,
and this is my reward?

14:15.897 --> 14:18.650
To be libeled by one of your staffers?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.652
Senator, we were all thrown
by these leaked documents.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.321
I just think we should be going
after the people that leaked them,

14:23.446 --> 14:25.949
- not the people that wrote them.
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.285
Perhaps you would feel differently

14:28.410 --> 14:30.787
if it was your character
that had been smeared.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.626
You know the power
I wield in the Senate.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.504
I'll give you some time to consider in
what way and how publicly

14:39.629 --> 14:41.047
you want to do this.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.968
But she needs to be gone
by the end of business.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.975
- Mr. President.
- Senator.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.483
Unbelievable.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.654
Like it or not,
he's not an enemy you want to make.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.657
He can hold up your entire economic
agenda for the next three years.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.745
You don't have a choice.
You have to accept my resignation.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.501
I appreciate the question,
and I-- and I understand it.

15:18.627 --> 15:22.297
Um, my public life's been an open book.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.382
Ever since I was a little boy,

15:24.507 --> 15:27.302
I-I took to heart John F. Kennedy's
call to service.

15:27.844 --> 15:32.390
I hope over the course of this hearing,
you're seeing how I lived up to that call.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.642
And do you think

15:33.767 --> 15:36.186
<i>you're qualified for the office
of Vice President?</i>

15:36.311 --> 15:38.980
<i>- My father instilled in me that...</i>
- Look at him.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.358
It's like he's channeling Camelot.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.526
He even looks like a Kennedy.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.697
Here's the contact info for
the eight members of MacLeish's unit

15:47.822 --> 15:51.076
on the 11/14 mission
living in the Virginia-Maryland area.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.619
Oh, great.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.584
I can't cover this much ground by myself.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.086
You take Virginia. I'll take Maryland.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.673
Just consider this an unofficial
battlefield promotion to field agent.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.924
Um...

16:06.049 --> 16:08.051
Also, call me on this,
not your regular phone.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.596
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes
computer guy.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.015
Chuck, I know I'm asking a lot,

16:14.140 --> 16:16.434
but there's a short list of people
that I trust right now.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.020
One of them is in jail
for something he didn't do,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.398
and the other one... is you.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.950
I got to tell you,

16:32.075 --> 16:34.577
I was relieved
when they gave me your case

16:35.745 --> 16:38.373
'cause I thought if anybody can help you,
it's gonna be me.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.291
John, you could never play the good cop.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.086
Just ask the questions,
and let's get this thing going.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.589
Why'd you waive
your right to an attorney?

16:47.882 --> 16:50.093
I have nothing to defend.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.636
I'm guilty.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.556
So you intended to poison Nassar
before you arrived at the prison?

16:54.931 --> 16:56.599
I had the Thallium

16:57.600 --> 17:00.937
in a salt packet hidden in my pocket.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.983
And you weren't at all concerned
about surveillance footage?

17:05.108 --> 17:08.278
There's a blind spot
by the North Hall corridor.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.823
An officer told me about it
some years ago

17:11.948 --> 17:16.286
in case I needed to have
an off-the-record with a prisoner.

17:16.411 --> 17:19.748
<i>I waited until
we cleared the cameras.</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:22.333
<i>I passed the food tray.</i>

17:22.459 --> 17:24.794
<i>Put the salt in Nassar's plate.</i>

17:25.420 --> 17:27.213
<i>How'd you know it was his?</i>

17:27.630 --> 17:29.632
<i>He's Muslim.</i>

17:29.758 --> 17:31.801
<i>Specially prepared halal meals.</i>

17:34.095 --> 17:35.972
Can we verify everything he's saying?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.349
My team's working on it, sir,
but so far, everything he said

17:38.475 --> 17:40.685
matches the forensic evidence
taken from the scene.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.354
- You came up with Jason Atwood, right?
- Yes, sir.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.523
We were in the same class at Quantico.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.275
Had our first assignments together.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.237
Could you ever imagine that he was
capable of committing such a crime?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.824
I've worked in the Office
of Professional Responsibility

17:54.949 --> 17:56.534
for 13 years, Mr. President.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.870
We may not want to think the worst
of people, but sometimes

17:58.995 --> 18:00.246
they leave us no choice.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.499
Right.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.681
Sir.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.267
We have an update
on the NSA whistleblower.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.852
Okay.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.314
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.398
What's going on?

18:27.524 --> 18:28.566
We found him, sir.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.235
- We found Gabriel Thompson.
- Where is he?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.362
He's on foreign soil, Mr. President.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.155
I thought we froze his passport.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.573
- How did he get out?
- He didn't.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.200
He's right down the street.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.537
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.664
He's seeking asylum
in the Venezuelan Embassy.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.125
No extradition treaty with the U.S., sir.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.502
You're telling me
he's right here in Washington, D.C.,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.295
and we can't touch him?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.764
<i>I'm afraid I cannot
turn over Gabriel Thompson,</i>

18:59.889 --> 19:03.434
<i>Mr. President. He's seeking asylum,
and we must respect that.</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:05.603
Mr. Ambassador,
there is a big difference

19:05.728 --> 19:08.690
between not sending back a petty criminal
who was arrested for marijuana

19:08.815 --> 19:11.776
and a fugitive who we consider
a threat to our national security.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.237
<i>Not technically, Mr. President.</i>

19:14.362 --> 19:16.114
<i>I can't dictate your nation's laws,</i>

19:16.239 --> 19:18.158
<i>and you cannot dictate mine.</i>

19:21.744 --> 19:24.372
Venezuela won't give him back... yet.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.791
I'll circle back to the drawing board,
see what I can do.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.793
We're still on the clock
with Hazelton, sir.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.545
One thing at a time, Seth.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.756
One thing at a time?
Since when?

19:33.882 --> 19:35.300
<i>Congressman MacLeish,</i>

19:35.425 --> 19:37.302
now, during your first tour
in Afghanistan,

19:37.427 --> 19:40.763
you were awarded a Bronze Star
for combat bravery.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.642
Now, can you please describe
the events of November 14, 2005,

19:44.767 --> 19:46.436
<i>to the best of your recollection?</i>

19:46.561 --> 19:49.314
Can you describe the events
of November 14, 2005...

19:49.439 --> 19:51.316
...to the best of your recollection?

19:51.441 --> 19:54.235
Captain MacLeish led
a Ranger Special Forces unit...

19:54.360 --> 19:57.655
...into a remote Afghani village
outside of Marja.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.909
As soon as we moved in,
our unit hit an IED, and...

20:01.034 --> 20:03.912
We were ambushed
by Taliban forces.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.330
Insurgents were heavily armed, and...

20:05.455 --> 20:07.582
We were pinned down
almost immediately.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.833
Hit, bleeding...

20:08.958 --> 20:11.336
Half my men clinging to life.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.838
The other half frozen in fear.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.715
And I--
And I include myself in that.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.009
I acted on pure instinct.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.678
Captain MacLeish returned enemy fire
single-handedly,

20:20.803 --> 20:22.305
drove back the insurgents...

20:22.430 --> 20:24.265
Allowing medics to get to us in time.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.977
The truth is I presided over
a failed mission that day.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.439
We didn't take the village,
and we lost a lot of good men.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.816
<i>I'm alive
because of Captain MacLeish.</i>

20:33.942 --> 20:36.527
So there's only one word to use
to describe a man like him.

20:36.653 --> 20:37.820
He's a hero.

20:37.946 --> 20:38.947
He's a hero.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.031
He's a hero.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.158
Well, that's what my medal says I am,

20:42.951 --> 20:44.619
but a hero?

20:44.744 --> 20:48.039
No. I only did what anyone
in my position would have done.

20:48.164 --> 20:52.001
It doesn't make me a hero.
It simply makes me who I am today.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.551
Every guy in his platoon
says the same thing.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.053
Let me guess, that he's a hero.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.972
<i>I know. Same answer I got, too.</i>

21:04.097 --> 21:05.515
Maybe your informant was wrong.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.517
Or maybe everyone
got the same talking points.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.186
I got one interview left.
I'm not giving up till it's over.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.281
You know you spend a lot more time
in my office than I do, right?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.409
- We need to talk about Hazelton.
- Don't worry about it. It'll blow over.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.245
- Just give it some time.
- No, it won't.

21:27.370 --> 21:30.498
And the president can't put me first,
not before critical legislation we need

21:30.623 --> 21:32.375
to get this country back on its feet.

21:32.500 --> 21:36.212
Stimulus bills, job creation,
those things go through appropriations,

21:36.337 --> 21:37.547
- through Hazelton.
- Emily,

21:37.672 --> 21:39.090
the president didn't accept
my resignation

21:39.215 --> 21:41.592
when I leaked the Al-Sakar video.
He barely even knew me.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.094
You're his most trusted adviser.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.179
- He's not gonna accept yours.
- I know.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.889
Which is why you're gonna accept it.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.563
No.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.441
It's your job to protect the president,

21:56.566 --> 21:58.568
even when that means
protecting him from himself.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.571
Emily, have you ever considered the fact
that he won't accept your resignation

22:01.696 --> 22:03.489
because he needs you here?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.577
And he's not the only one.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.919
- Hi.
- I can come back.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.921
- No, no. Stay.
- You're fine. What is it?

22:20.590 --> 22:23.301
This is what I like to call
"I told you so",

22:23.426 --> 22:25.303
a list of every media outlet
in the country

22:25.428 --> 22:27.805
and their requests
for an exclusive with the president

22:27.930 --> 22:30.808
to discuss, among other things,
the Nassar murder investigation.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.769
Feel free to tell them no, Seth.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.979
- You know that.
- Can't blame them for trying.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.523
I mean, who doesn't want
five minutes with the president?

22:38.524 --> 22:39.942
Wait, what did you just say?

22:40.777 --> 22:42.111
I said who doesn't want--

22:42.236 --> 22:43.946
Five minutes with the president.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.574
Emily, call the Venezuelan Ambassador,

22:46.699 --> 22:48.242
and you tell him I'm on my way.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.621
- What just happened?
- No idea.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.794
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't realize
your husband had passed away.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.296
He re-upped without telling me.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.632
He said he couldn't leave things
the way they were.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.843
And his first tour with the Ranger unit,
that was commanded

23:05.968 --> 23:07.970
- by Congressman Peter MacLeish.
- I think so.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.598
Steven never liked
talking about his service.

23:10.723 --> 23:14.185
I didn't even realize
he enjoyed his time in the Army

23:14.310 --> 23:16.771
until one day the Army
shipped home his foot locker.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.023
In it were all these mementos.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.983
You know, medals that he had won,

23:21.776 --> 23:23.653
letters from his old buddies.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.572
Tons of pictures of his tours.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.867
Sarah, do you mind
if I take a look at that foot locker?

23:29.992 --> 23:30.785
Sure.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.460
Right this way.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.337
Thanks.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.508
Mr. Thompson, I'm Aaron Shore,
Chief of Staff to the president.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.845
I know who you are.
I'm on Venezuelan soil, Mr. Shore.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.221
You can't arrest me.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.223
I'm well aware of diplomatic law.

23:52.348 --> 23:53.850
Well, then, why are you here?

23:53.975 --> 23:55.476
Because I know what you want.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.855
Really?

23:59.355 --> 24:02.150
<i>CNN</i> says I want radical transparency.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.027
The <i>New York Times</i> says
I want anarchy.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.281
What's your guess, Mr. Shore?

24:09.365 --> 24:11.534
Five minutes with the president.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.878
What makes you so sure
I want to see the president?

24:22.837 --> 24:25.840
You've been very specific
with what you've posted on the Internet.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.259
First you attacked members
of the Richmond cabinet,

24:28.384 --> 24:30.720
every one of them, except Kirkman.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.222
Then you went after
his most trusted adviser.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.100
You made sure he'd notice.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.685
Am I getting warm?

24:40.396 --> 24:41.939
Yes.

24:43.357 --> 24:46.235
Hell of a way to get an audience
with the leader of the free world.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.863
We use the tools we have, Mr. Shore.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.658
Yes, but you've hurt,
perhaps irreparably, a good friend,

24:54.327 --> 24:57.205
a brilliant, loyal adviser
to the president,

24:57.330 --> 25:00.875
and being that I'm the one person
who can grant you access to the president,

25:01.250 --> 25:03.252
why should I reward you with his time?

25:03.377 --> 25:07.548
Because I had to hang Emily Rhodes
in the wind to get your attention.

25:09.091 --> 25:12.220
But I'm also the guy
that can save her career.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.486
They were on the same mission.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.655
Catalan and MacLeish know each other.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.865
11/14, that's what my source
wanted me to know.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.200
Oh, my God.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.868
<i>Yeah, I know it's not a smoking gun,</i>

26:17.994 --> 26:21.122
but it puts us a hell of a lot closer
than it did an hour ago.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.834
Chuck, I'm going to need into
the counter-terror joint database.

26:28.838 --> 26:29.880
<i>Chuck.</i>

26:30.006 --> 26:31.882
- What?
<i>- Are you still there?</i>

26:32.008 --> 26:34.385
<i>- Hello?</i>
- They shut me out of my computer.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.512
<i>- What?</i>
- My login's not working.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.515
Foerstel must know you took MacLeish's
files off-site without clearance.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.852
He is heading right towards me.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.687
That means he's gonna be
looking for you, too.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.355
<i>Hannah, don't come back.
Find a way.</i>

26:47.857 --> 26:49.191
Finish this.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.331
- Gabriel Thompson wants a meeting with me?
- Yes, sir.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.500
And to facilitate one, he gave me this.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.087
- What is it?
- It's a show of good faith, sir.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.589
It's proof that everything

27:11.714 --> 27:13.424
Emily said about
Senator Hazelton is true.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.594
A year's worth of inappropriate
e-mails, text messages,

27:16.719 --> 27:18.429
chats with a Senate page.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.724
And he's agreed to stop releasing files
and hand over everything he has?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.517
If you meet with him, yes.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.858
I'm not sure inviting a man
who stole classified documents

27:30.983 --> 27:32.693
into the White House is an option,

27:32.818 --> 27:34.070
no matter what he has.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.283
But we do have to take care of this
business with Senator Hazelton.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.285
Let's see if we can
get him over here now.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.912
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Aaron.

27:43.037 --> 27:44.038
Sir.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.961
Congresswoman Hookstraten,
last time we spoke,

27:51.087 --> 27:53.214
I told you I'd keep you updated
on the Capitol bombing.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.217
Did you find what you were
looking for in room 105?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.218
Yes, I did.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.762
And I need you to delay
the MacLeish hearings.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.306
Go on.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.141
<i>Congresswoman, I can't talk
about this over the phone,</i>

28:04.266 --> 28:07.144
but I'm working a lead that could prove
damning to Peter MacLeish.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.604
But I need time.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.608
Ms. Wells, you're asking me
to put my reputation on the line.

28:12.733 --> 28:13.984
How much time?

28:14.110 --> 28:15.736
As much as you can give me.

28:20.908 --> 28:21.951
Mr. President.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.619
Thank you
for taking the time.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.793
I thought I made myself clear.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.171
- Why is she still working here?
- Because, Senator,

28:34.296 --> 28:37.591
I'm the one who chooses
which of my staffers I let go.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.510
And I try to make a point

28:39.635 --> 28:41.512
by not starting out with my best one.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.805
Excuse me?

28:42.930 --> 28:45.182
Everything Ms. Rhodes
said about you is true,

28:45.307 --> 28:46.976
and I have the proof to back it up.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.686
I don't believe you.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.021
I think you've heard
of our recent interactions

28:51.147 --> 28:53.357
with Gabriel Thompson,
the NSA whistleblower?

28:53.482 --> 28:57.653
So far, everything that he's released
has proved to be 100% accurate.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.157
Sir, he has you dead to rights.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.325
An 18-year-old Senate page.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.046
This is extortion.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.882
No, Senator,

29:18.007 --> 29:20.885
I am simply presenting you
with the truth.

29:21.010 --> 29:23.345
Extortion would be threatening

29:23.471 --> 29:25.973
to compromise
the American economic stability

29:26.098 --> 29:28.184
unless I fire one of my staff members

29:28.934 --> 29:31.520
because she wrote something
that you didn't like.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.232
You have a wife of 35 years,

29:35.357 --> 29:37.693
two beautiful children,
three grandchildren.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.905
Earlier, you retired
to spend time with them.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.033
I strongly suggest
you consider doing that again.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.846
So, what about you?

30:07.723 --> 30:09.725
Think you want to stick around
a little longer?

30:11.811 --> 30:14.688
Luckily, there's no place I'd rather be.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.399
Good.

30:31.539 --> 30:35.251
So, it turns out that America's favorite
vice presidential candidate

30:35.376 --> 30:38.003
and the CIA's most wanted mercenary

30:38.420 --> 30:39.755
know each other.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.888
- You're not buying it's a coincidence.
- Sorry.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.224
If Catalan worked intel
on the 11/14 mission,

30:50.349 --> 30:53.269
the CIA would have a file on it.
Did you pull it?

30:55.104 --> 30:56.480
I would have if there was one.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.399
Are you kidding me?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.776
- Someone buried it?
- So I looked deeper.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.028
I found this.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.035
It was written by an agency liaison
on the ground.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.955
Not quite the same story
that MacLeish has been telling.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.456
"On November 14, 2005,

31:14.582 --> 31:18.168
a Ranger unit massacred
a series of Afghani villages

31:18.294 --> 31:21.630
after several of their unit
had been killed by a Taliban sniper.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.800
Three villages in 24 hours.
Countless dead."

31:25.759 --> 31:27.386
And the Pentagon whitewashed this?

31:29.138 --> 31:31.265
Peter MacLeish isn't a war hero.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.768
No, he's a war criminal.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.282
I heard about Emily.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.368
So that's one crisis resolved.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.288
Now I'm reading about the other one,
Gabriel Thompson.

31:54.622 --> 31:58.208
This is his psychological profile,
courtesy of the State Department,

31:58.334 --> 32:00.127
federal law enforcement, and the NSA.

32:02.129 --> 32:03.839
Alex, what the hell am I missing?

32:03.964 --> 32:07.384
I mean, it seems like
every time I turn around,

32:07.509 --> 32:09.386
there's someone who's served
this country faithfully,

32:09.511 --> 32:12.306
and then out of the blue,
decides to turn against it.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.476
Are you talking about the whistleblower
or Jason Atwood now?

32:15.601 --> 32:16.727
Both of them.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.354
NSA analyst turns traitor.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.981
Deputy FBI director commits murder.
It doesn't add up.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.528
What does your gut say about Thompson?

32:27.655 --> 32:31.200
Well, despite the advice
of my National Security Team,

32:31.325 --> 32:33.243
the protocols of
the Office of the Presidency,

32:33.369 --> 32:35.663
and my own common sense...

32:37.665 --> 32:39.708
...I don't think this guy's crazy.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.585
He's smart.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.797
And he knows once he leaves
the protection of the embassy,

32:45.339 --> 32:47.549
he's going to prison for a long time.

32:47.675 --> 32:50.761
So whatever the reason
for wanting to sit down with you is,

32:50.886 --> 32:53.806
it must be pretty important
for him to trade in his life for it.

32:57.351 --> 32:58.811
Well, what could it be?

32:59.353 --> 33:01.563
That's the part I can't figure out.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.733
You will. You just need to look deeper.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.717
Empty your pockets.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.837
In a few moments, they're going to be
taking you to federal prison,

34:06.962 --> 34:08.630
so I need to make this quick.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.341
I know you had
a stepdaughter named Charlotte

34:11.467 --> 34:13.677
who was an intern
in Congressman Ellsworth's office.

34:13.802 --> 34:17.181
I know that she was at the State
of the Union and died in the bombing.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.768
Different birth father and last name,
made it harder to make the connection.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.855
I also understand that you raised her
since she was a baby,

34:24.980 --> 34:26.607
so she was yours, too.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.443
Children should never die
before their parents.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.860
No.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.987
No, they should not.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.992
And I am very sorry for your loss.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.244
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.831
And as a father,
I understand your anger and your grief.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.668
But it still doesn't answer
my main question.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.839
You sacrificed a great deal
to have this meeting with me.

34:51.465 --> 34:52.674
Why?

34:53.007 --> 34:55.677
I needed someone I could trust

34:56.469 --> 34:59.223
to make sure an attack like that
never happens again.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.391
And what makes you think
you can trust me?

35:01.517 --> 35:03.268
Oh, I did my research,

35:03.685 --> 35:06.688
read every e-mail you sent,
every document you wrote.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.858
Your ethics are above reproach.

35:10.692 --> 35:14.071
Not to mention every fourth text you send
is to your children.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.996
Inside that evidence bag
is my pocket change.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.459
There is a fake coin, a quarter.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.088
Inside it is the hard drive I took.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.048
I did not make copies.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.309
Why are you giving this to me?

35:46.061 --> 35:50.566
Because you have much bigger problems
than me, Mr. President.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.822
Transport is ready.

35:58.740 --> 36:02.244
Careful who you show
file 12-80C to, sir.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.756
Mike, that man gave up
his career and his freedom

36:14.882 --> 36:16.842
for what's on this hard drive.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.345
I want to know why.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.984
This laptop's air-gapped.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.571
So if there's malware on this drive,
it'll only affect this computer.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.449
De-encryption software's already running.

36:40.574 --> 36:41.992
How do you know all this?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.827
Before I was assigned
to your protective detail,

36:43.952 --> 36:46.121
I rotated through investigations,

36:46.246 --> 36:48.832
threat assessment,
and our technical department.

36:48.957 --> 36:51.752
Two and a half years staring
at computer code.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.129
Let's just say
I like working for you more.

36:54.588 --> 36:55.672
Good.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.299
Look, until we know
exactly what this is,

36:57.424 --> 36:59.259
I want it to stay between us.
Understood?

36:59.384 --> 37:00.594
Yes, sir.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.596
Mr. President.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.850
Congresswoman Hookstraten
just called for an extended recess.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.311
- She's delaying MacLeish's hearing.
- Why?

37:09.436 --> 37:10.854
She's being cagey,
but a House staffer says

37:10.979 --> 37:13.690
she's got information on MacLeish
that could be critical to the hearing.

37:13.815 --> 37:14.858
We're trying to find out more.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.861
The Congresswoman and I don't agree
on much, but she's not crazy.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.988
She must think that she's got
something substantial on him,

37:20.113 --> 37:22.199
otherwise she wouldn't risk it.
Get me MacLeish.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.283
Yes, sir.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.827
Mike, I'll make sure you're not disturbed.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.665
Well, I guess I'll just get right to it.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.376
Congresswoman Hookstraten
thinks she has information on you

37:32.501 --> 37:35.003
- that can alter the hearings.
- You know what it is?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.506
No. No, I don't.

37:37.631 --> 37:40.592
But if there's something you need
to tell me, Peter, this is the time.

37:41.969 --> 37:44.346
Well, everything I've ever told you
has been true.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.890
I served my country loyally.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.976
I dedicated myself to my family,

37:49.101 --> 37:53.188
the people of my district,
the entire nation.

37:53.647 --> 37:54.856
Okay.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.026
Okay. I hope you understand I had to ask.

37:58.151 --> 38:00.904
Yeah, of course, of course.
And thank you for your support.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.448
You know it always...
It always means the world.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.076
- Sorry to trouble you, Peter.
- No. No, no.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.327
Okay.

38:08.829 --> 38:11.373
No, you know, sir, there...

38:11.498 --> 38:13.834
There's something
that's been nagging at me.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.880
Jason Atwood confessed
to murdering Majid Nassar.

38:19.006 --> 38:21.216
The agent he valued the most,

38:21.341 --> 38:23.427
uh, Special Agent Hannah Wells...

38:23.552 --> 38:24.928
I don't know.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.722
I-I heard she lost
someone in the bombing.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.890
Maybe that's got
something to do with it, but...

38:30.684 --> 38:33.228
She seemed to be
a bit obsessed with me.

38:34.313 --> 38:37.232
I just hope she isn't trying
to convince the speaker of any, uh...

38:37.357 --> 38:39.568
fantasy or conspiracy theory.

38:40.235 --> 38:43.071
Thank you for letting me know.
I'll keep an eye out.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.489
Yeah.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.700
Good night, Peter.

38:58.712 --> 38:59.755
Agent Wells.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.922
<i>Just in time.</i>

39:01.048 --> 39:03.300
I found the evidence I was looking for
on Peter MacLeish.

39:03.425 --> 39:04.801
<i>I'll explain everything
when I get there.</i>

39:04.926 --> 39:06.511
I'm just heading up Constitution now.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.014
Thank you for letting me know.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.063
Congressman George,

39:16.188 --> 39:17.898
gather the rest of the committee.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.775
My witness will be here in 10 minutes.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.109
Yes, ma'am.

39:32.954 --> 39:37.167
I didn't get a chance to thank you earlier
for saving my job today.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.668
Thank you.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.421
Don't even mention it.
You're a good employee.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.967
You did all of that
to keep a good employee around.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.601
All right, I may have other reasons.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.024
Well, I have work to do.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.568
If you think of any of those reasons,
let me know, okay?

40:06.780 --> 40:07.823
Hey, Emily.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.577
When you're finished
with work tonight...

40:16.164 --> 40:17.332
...dinner?

40:20.460 --> 40:21.837
Okay.

40:36.685 --> 40:37.936
Come on!

40:41.022 --> 40:44.818
I located File 12-80C. I was waiting
for you before I opened it.

41:04.546 --> 41:05.672
Move!

41:30.655 --> 41:32.115
Who created this?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.116
We did, sir.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.743
United States Government.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.079
November 17, 2013.

41:38.205 --> 41:40.916
Special Committee
for Threat Assessment, Pentagon.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.417
Classified Top Secret.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.253
This is the Capitol bombing.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.423
Right down to the same ordinance.

41:48.548 --> 41:51.259
They're assessing
our security vulnerabilities.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.388
They war-gamed this out
years before it even happened.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.976
Someone inside the U.S. government

42:00.101 --> 42:03.605
handed over the blueprints to Majid Nassar
for the Capitol bombing.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.195
There's a traitor among us.
