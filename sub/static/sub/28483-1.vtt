00:23.457 --> 00:26.025
 - [Brian] It's the last thing
          you think of

00:26.027 --> 00:28.293
      until it becomes the
    only thing you think of.

00:29.697 --> 00:33.065
It can happen to anyone, at any
            moment.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.406
         (gentle music)

02:00.488 --> 02:02.421
     - I tell Jim and Katie
    no running in the house,

02:02.423 --> 02:05.324
  and then you come flying in
  here like a bat outta hell.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.458
   - They're not even up yet.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.627
   Come here, take off these
            clothes.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.329
  - Oh, are you doing laundry?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.597
 - I'll do whatever you want me
             to do.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.133
      (Mary Beth laughing)

02:14.135 --> 02:16.268
    (Katie and Jim laughing)

02:16.270 --> 02:17.236
          - Oh, darn.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.239
     If you had only run a
  little faster this morning.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.607
             - Oh.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.242
  I'll keep that in mind next
             time.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.812
  - So, which of your buddies

02:26.814 --> 02:28.881
from Alcoholics not-so-Anonymous

02:28.883 --> 02:30.782
 are going up to Wisconsin with
              you?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.751
   - Oh, the usual suspects.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.220
       Kevin, Joe, Henry.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.722
   We're just going up there
     to finish up the deck.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.790
  It's not like we're gonna be
   boozing the whole weekend.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.626
            - Mmhmm.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.461
      - Besides, you know
    that I'm a two beer guy.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.229
 - Yeah, because anything after
             that,

02:44.231 --> 02:46.431
and I could have my clothes off
             and--

02:46.433 --> 02:47.766
        - How dare you?
            - Daddy!

02:47.768 --> 02:48.634
             - Oh!

02:48.636 --> 02:52.804
   (Brian growling playfully)

02:52.806 --> 02:54.206
         Love you guys.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.576
    I'm gonna take a shower.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.417
 Fantastic, I'm gonna get this
 over to production right away

03:05.419 --> 03:09.421
 and your ETA will be 28 days.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.856
       No, no, thank you.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.724
      All right, bye-bye.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.628
   - [Thomas] Brian, can you
   please check on the status

03:16.630 --> 03:17.829
 of these three orders please?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.831
       - Yes, sir, I can.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.768
 All right, these two went out
           yesterday.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.736
          - Fantastic.
         - And this one

03:24.738 --> 03:26.905
actually went out this morning.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.474
            - Great.
         - And this one

03:30.277 --> 03:31.843
I just collected the deposit on.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.379
             - Wow.
           - Uh huh.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.681
    - Is that a new account?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.883
           - Uh huh.
            - Nice.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.718
     - You bet your bippy.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.987
  So, um, oh wait, I'm sorry,

03:42.923 --> 03:45.624
do you, do you smell something?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.259
         What is that?

03:47.261 --> 03:49.361
    I think I smell a bonus.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.697
      - Yeah, we'll talk.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.432
 - I'm gonna be looking for it.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.536
    (bowling ball rumbling)

03:57.538 --> 03:58.804
        (Kevin laughing)

03:58.806 --> 04:00.022
 - [Kevin] Hey, don't be afraid

04:00.023 --> 04:01.239
to actually hit the pins, Henry,
              huh?

04:01.242 --> 04:01.974
             - Wow.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.492
 We've been playing for years,

04:03.493 --> 04:05.009
   you'd think you would have
 actually gotten better by now.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.412
    - Ah, you'll get it next
 time, you'll get it next time.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.780
   - Don't lie to him, Brian.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.450
        (guys laughing)

04:11.452 --> 04:12.618
     - [Henry] Hey, shots!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.586
           - Oh yeah!
         - Here you go.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.854
     - Here's your drinks.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.023
       - Thank you, Jen.
       - Thank you, Jen.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.791
- Ooh, Brian, you sure know how
           to score.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.361
      - Um, yeah, thanks.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.997
You know who really knows how to
             score?

04:24.999 --> 04:27.666
             Joey.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.334
   Scored post season tickets
      like it was nothing.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.920
      Real man of action.

04:31.921 --> 04:33.504
  - One of the perks of being
   top salesman of the year.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.757
          (chuckling)

04:34.758 --> 04:36.008
- I cannot believe in a million
             years

04:36.010 --> 04:38.644
  that I'm actually excited to
   go back to Cleveland, huh?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.478
         - No kidding.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.912
          Thanks, Jen.
            - Yeah.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.714
- All right, to, uh, Cleveland.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.616
            - Yeah!
  - Woo-hoo, just gotta rock.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.422
- Mmm, sweet nectar of the gods.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.658
- Get me a little something for
             Joey.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.460
        (guys laughing)

04:56.830 --> 04:58.463
  - Jenny is so far out of his
            league,

04:58.465 --> 05:00.499
  they're not even playing the
          same sport.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.034
    Come on Bri, you're up.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.568
- All right, all right, let's do
              it.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.638
      (upbeat rock music)

05:08.375 --> 05:09.541
              Oh!

05:09.543 --> 05:11.343
       (pins clattering)
              Yes!

05:11.345 --> 05:13.378
    - Oh, you're kidding me!
          - Fuck, Bri!

05:13.380 --> 05:16.315
     At least make it look
    like you're trying, man.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.517
    - Language, brother, you
    know I don't like that.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.753
   - Sorry, I forgot how good
     of a Catholic you are.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.389
    Or maybe, you know, it's
     because you had such a

05:24.391 --> 05:27.926
 massive crush on Sister Alice,
              huh?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.629
You know, you used to curse like
            a sailor

05:30.631 --> 05:32.064
     until she came along.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.031
  Though, she was pretty hot.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.866
             - Shh!
         - Who, Jenny?

05:34.868 --> 05:35.967
         I know, right?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.536
            So hot.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.705
     Well, you can lay off
     Kev, I got her number.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.639
          - [Guys] Oh!

05:42.042 --> 05:45.043
       (insects chirping)

05:53.987 --> 05:54.920
            - What?

05:54.922 --> 05:57.389
      - Mary Beth, did you
     do something different

05:57.391 --> 05:58.857
   with the mashed potatoes?

05:58.859 --> 06:01.026
  - I did, I added some fresh
             dill.

06:01.028 --> 06:01.927
        Do you like it?

06:03.931 --> 06:04.863
       - It's different.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.767
- How's Joe's car coming along?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.736
 Did you guys find the problem?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.437
     - Ah, we gotta switch
     out the muffler first,

06:12.439 --> 06:13.739
  but I'm sure it'll be okay.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.741
       - It's a big job.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.742
- Nah, you know I like that kind
           of stuff.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.810
        (armpit farting)

06:18.812 --> 06:21.947
  - Jim, at the table, really?

06:21.949 --> 06:23.548
  - That was grandpa, not me!

06:23.550 --> 06:25.751
     - Oh, that wasn't me.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.820
At least, I don't think that was
              me.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.222
 - Looks like we might have to

06:30.223 --> 06:31.623
  switch out grandpa's muffler
              too.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.658
  (kids and grandpa laughing)

06:33.660 --> 06:34.593
       Nice chicken, mmm.
        - Thanks, babe.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.998
 - Any chance there'll be room
  for me in that car tomorrow?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.032
         - Yeah, right.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.567
   You're not going up there.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.404
      I don't even like it
     when he goes up there.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.406
I got a bad feeling about this,
             Brian.

06:48.509 --> 06:52.077
 - Mom, you say the same thing
          every time.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.113
  And every time, I come home
    in one piece just fine.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.483
      Oh, I love you, ma.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.452
  - [Mrs. Sweeney] I love you,
              too.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.155
         (gentle music)

07:03.157 --> 07:05.024
  - [Mr. Sweeney] Good night.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.892
      - Have a nice night.
         - Good night!

07:11.965 --> 07:14.800
        (Brian sighing)

07:15.669 --> 07:17.736
   - The kids are finally...

07:19.973 --> 07:21.106
            Asleep.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.074
    - You like what you see?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.075
          - Yes I do.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.011
           Yes I do.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.689
  - Good, 'cause then you can
         remember this

07:37.691 --> 07:39.057
 when those trashy local girls

07:39.059 --> 07:41.860
 try to get your attention this
            weekend.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.597
   (Brian growling playfully)

07:53.106 --> 07:54.706
         (both moaning)

07:54.708 --> 07:56.041
        - [Katie] Mommy?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.912
     - [Brian] Don't worry
   about it, she'll be fine.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.916
        - [Katie] Mommy!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.486
      (Mary Beth sighing)

08:07.488 --> 08:09.521
  - I should go check on her.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.655
         - No, let me.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.625
It's probably just the monsters.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.598
  - You are such a good daddy.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.166
 Now go get rid of that monster
             quick,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.535
   then come back here, okay?

08:23.537 --> 08:26.238
   - [Brian] Mmm, yes, ma'am.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.010
   What's wrong, Snugglehead?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.812
  - I think the monsters came
             back,

08:33.813 --> 08:35.046
   and they're under my bed.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.251
       I can smell them.

08:39.253 --> 08:42.687
 - Really, you can smell them,
              hmm?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.823
     Well, I thought I got
     rid of them last time,

08:44.825 --> 08:47.058
 but I better double-check for
          sure, okay?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.128
       All right, hello?

08:50.998 --> 08:52.864
    Anybody underneath here?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.268
  Any of you sneaky monsters?

08:59.540 --> 09:02.574
  - Oh, maybe that's what I'm
           smelling.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.610
            - Mmhmm.
        - Sorry, daddy.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.045
         - Why, Katie?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.280
        - Sorry, daddy.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.949
    - Why didn't you tell me
    that old stinky hotdogs

09:10.951 --> 09:12.918
      keep monsters away?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.653
     - That actually works?

09:14.655 --> 09:15.620
   - [Brian] Oh, that totally
             works.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.855
         - Put it back!

09:16.857 --> 09:18.991
       (Brian chuckling)

09:18.992 --> 09:21.126
- Katie, this is why you're not
  allowed to eat in your room.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.962
  This is kinda gross because
     I don't even remember

09:23.964 --> 09:25.931
 the last time we had hot dogs.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.401
        How about this?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.569
  Next time, why don't you try
          being brave?

09:31.572 --> 09:34.206
        - [Katie] Brave?

09:34.207 --> 09:36.841
     - Oh yeah, being brave
      is the very best way

09:36.843 --> 09:39.244
  to keep monsters from coming
             back.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.979
     Think you can do that?

09:47.354 --> 09:49.854
   Bravery Bear, meet Katie.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.057
  Katie, this is Bravery Bear.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.159
       - That's Bubbles.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.095
  - Well, he's been promoted.

09:57.097 --> 10:02.133
  So, anytime you get scared,
    it's Bravery Bear's job

10:03.036 --> 10:05.070
     to make you feel safe.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.038
   So you just give him a big
            squeeze.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.741
     Think you can do that?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.642
            - Okay.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.876
          - All right.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.777
       I love you, honey.

  Yeah, so I take it that I'm

11:07.000 --> 11:08.299

         That's enough.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.137

          - Fuck off.

12:54.040 --> 12:54.973
            - Okay.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.777
    I always love coming to

     - I'm fucking leaving!

            - Okay.
     - All right, let's go.

      out Ricky, let's go!

13:38.285 --> 13:40.185

     wife, you dumb bitch!

      Pussy motherfuckers!

14:37.344 --> 14:39.344
Well, you can take this with ya!

14:40.413 --> 14:41.646
 - [Joe] I rode with him in the
           ambulance.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.949
      The cops drove Henry
    and Kevin to the cabin.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.452
 The nurse said he'll be fine.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.990
   That he has a hangover and
  just needs to sleep it off.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.058
- Thanks for calling and letting
            me know.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.061
     I'm on my way, so I'll
   see you in a couple hours.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.098
  - [Joe] Sorry again, we may
  have overdid it last night.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.032
           - Shocker.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.674
  Jim, Katie, go get dressed.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.276
 You're going to the sitter's.

15:13.914 --> 15:17.515
  (phone ringing and buzzing)

15:21.388 --> 15:22.587
             Hello?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.456
        (dramatic music)

15:25.458 --> 15:26.958
   Yes, this is Mrs. Sweeney.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.265
             What?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.528
        - Brian has been
   stabilized and transferred

16:03.530 --> 16:04.595
  to the intensive care unit.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.596
     - I don't understand.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.432
   How is this even possible?

16:07.434 --> 16:10.468
     First I'm told that my
 husband has a severe hangover,

16:10.470 --> 16:14.305
  and now you're telling me he
   has a severe brain injury?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.208
  - Mrs. Sweeney, I apologize
  for the initial misdiagnosis

16:17.210 --> 16:18.810
       upon his arrival.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.411
       On the surface, it
   appeared to be a hangover.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.413
  When there were no signs of
   improvement this morning,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.048
  we began a round of testing.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.451
   The CAT scan came back and
            revealed

16:26.453 --> 16:28.186
  substantial brain swelling.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.722
    That bar keeps us pretty
      busy and we thought

16:30.724 --> 16:32.290
        he was another--
       - Okay, whatever.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.458
      What does this mean?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.728
   - What it means is that if
 the swelling does not go down,

16:36.730 --> 16:39.163
  we have to perform surgery.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.066
      Look, Mrs. Sweeney,
    what I'm gonna tell you

16:42.068 --> 16:43.267
       will not be easy.

16:45.005 --> 16:45.770
         - Wait, wait.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.139
             What?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.707
   You are not saying that--

16:49.709 --> 16:53.544
   - Please, there's a strong
possibility he may not make it.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.014
             - No.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.133
       No, you're wrong.

16:58.134 --> 17:00.251
     - Please understand--
  - No, you're fucking wrong!

17:00.253 --> 17:01.653
       - I know this is--
             - No!

17:01.654 --> 17:03.054
 I want to see my husband right
              now!

17:04.557 --> 17:06.190
 - I will get someone for you.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.429
  Nurse Lisa to 1012, please.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.409
      - Oh my God, Brian!

17:24.411 --> 17:27.111
 - The bruising got much worse
           overnight.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.746
He didn't look like this when he
             was--

17:28.748 --> 17:30.782
  - Are the restraints really
           necessary?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.485
   - A lot of times, patients
      with these injuries,

17:34.487 --> 17:36.587
 when they wake up, they become
           combative.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.690
   - Can I be alone with him,
            please?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.691
        - Oh, of course.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.428
 If you need me, I'll be right
            outside.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.165
            - Hey...

17:47.167 --> 17:50.234
 Oh my God, what did they do to
              you?

17:52.672 --> 17:53.604
              Bri?

17:54.441 --> 17:55.807
      Stay with me, okay?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.076
        Can you hear me?

17:59.712 --> 18:00.845
         Stay with me.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.284
We're gonna get you home, okay?

18:08.388 --> 18:12.523
(Mary Beth crying and sniffling)

18:25.338 --> 18:28.206
        (dramatic music)

18:40.753 --> 18:42.420
    - Mrs. Sweeney, if Brian
           recovers--

18:42.422 --> 18:43.354
            - When.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.258
 - When Brian recovers, there's
    still no way of knowing

18:47.260 --> 18:48.893
  to what degree, and patients
          with this--

18:48.895 --> 18:50.728
    - He's going to be fine.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.199
    - There's a measurement
 called the Glasgow Coma Scale.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.735
  Brian's current ranking is a
             three.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.220
    - That's not bad, right?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.704
  I mean, how many numbers are
             there?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.607
- The scale is from three to 15.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.678
    Mrs. Sweeney, we're not
equipped to handle the severity

19:07.680 --> 19:08.930
        of his injuries.

19:08.931 --> 19:10.181
 There's a specialist in Green
              Bay

19:10.183 --> 19:11.516
 that we would like to transfer
            him to--

19:11.518 --> 19:12.817
           - No, no.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.386
             Here.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.889
    This is where I want my
    husband transferred to.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.491
      He's one of the best
 neurosurgeons in the country.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.426
 He's in Chicago, close to our
             home,

19:22.428 --> 19:23.861
 and that is where I want him.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.865
   I believe that's actually
 closer than Green Bay, right?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.434
     - Yes, that's correct.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.837
  Dr. Synkowski's a brilliant
           physician.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.439
I can see that you've done your
           research.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.908
         - Yes, I have.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.376
I did some right after you told
               me

19:38.378 --> 19:39.944
  my husband was misdiagnosed.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.352
          - Oh my God!
             - Hey.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.656
  - [Mrs. Sweeney] Oh my God!

19:51.658 --> 19:53.591
        (dramatic music)

19:58.398 --> 20:00.631
  - Joe, tell me what the fuck
           happened.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.033
    - We didn't do a thing.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.434
   One minute, we're leaving,
  and the next, we look back,

20:03.436 --> 20:05.536
  and Brian's sprawled on the
            ground.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.706
 - Where the hell are Kevin and
             Henry?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.692
    Do they know something?

20:10.693 --> 20:12.677
   - No, no, they're back at
   the cabin sleeping it off.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.478
 They have no idea how bad this
              is.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.348
 We were told he just had a bad
           hangover.

20:21.287 --> 20:21.986
          - Let's go.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.990
           - Steve--
            - Steve!

20:41.674 --> 20:43.674
           (sighing)

20:43.676 --> 20:45.243
          - You ready?

20:45.245 --> 20:45.977
            - Yeah.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.353
          (rock music)

20:55.355 --> 20:58.256
   - Hey, what can I get ya?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.360
     - Can you tell me what
   happened here last night?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.028
 - Always a good time, friend.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.031
  - Can you be more specific?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.002
   - From what I understand,

21:11.003 --> 21:13.404
     a couple of big shots
  rolled in here from Chicago,

21:13.406 --> 21:16.641
throwin' money around, which we
             like,

21:16.643 --> 21:21.712
 and uh, shootin' their mouths
   off, which we don't like.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.414
        - Is that right?

21:23.416 --> 21:26.917
     - And one of them shot
   it off a little too much,

21:26.919 --> 21:29.287
 and he had to be rolled right
              out.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.889
   Which is what he deserved.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.492
- That big shot happens to be my
            brother!

21:35.428 --> 21:36.994
   Now cut the shit, old man,

21:36.996 --> 21:39.997
     use your fuckin' head,
     and be more specific!

21:39.999 --> 21:41.799
       - Whoa, I'm sorry.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.704
Uh, I thought you were lawyers.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.975
 I didn't know you were crazy.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.679
  I don't know what happened.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.880
      I wasn't even here.

21:55.882 --> 21:59.884
  I only know what I know from
          drunk folks,

22:00.953 --> 22:03.988
     so, I can't help you.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.750
- What the hell, Steve, you're a
              cop!

22:15.751 --> 22:16.901
    You know you can't pull
      a gun out like that!

22:16.903 --> 22:18.319
 - [Steve] Just get in the car.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.736
     - Where we going now?
       - Police station.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.871
 - What, to turn ourselves in?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.473
  - No, to see what they know.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.913
        (dramatic music)

22:59.078 --> 23:00.778
     - [Dr. Synkowski] Uh,
    Excuse me, Mrs. Sweeney?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.046
             - Yes?
      - I'm Dr. Synkowski.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.147
    How are you holding up?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.583
 - [Mary Beth] Uh, I'm okay, I
             guess.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.335
- [Dr. Synkowski] I understand.

23:07.336 --> 23:09.086
 Look, I'm gonna spare you the
 statistics for the time being.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.722
- I appreciate that, and please,
   you can call me Mary Beth.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.357
       - Okay, Mary Beth.

23:13.358 --> 23:14.991
  Um, I'm sure at this point,
    you're very well-versed

23:14.994 --> 23:16.961
on how serious the situation is.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.964
    - Yes, very much so, but
     he's not a statistic,

23:19.966 --> 23:21.732
  and he's not going to be one
            either.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.834
   - Okay, I can't guarantee
            success,

23:23.836 --> 23:26.404
   but I can guarantee that I
 will do everything in my power

23:26.406 --> 23:27.538
     to help your husband.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.041
   - I already like you more
     than the other doctor.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.678
    - Well, you should, I'm
  quite good, as is my staff.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.230
    You know, for starters,

23:36.231 --> 23:37.781
 we know the difference between
           hangovers

23:37.784 --> 23:39.183
 and traumatic brain injuries.

23:40.653 --> 23:44.088
   Okay, look, stay as strong
  as your husband, Mary Beth.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.990
 We might just walk out of this
             okay.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.792
          - I hope so.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.897
        (dice rattling)

23:55.768 --> 23:57.668
     - [Marilyn] All right.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.806
  - This game is so much fun.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.541
       - This game sucks.

24:03.543 --> 24:06.477
   - Oh, come on, you're the
 one who picked it out, buddy.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.812
And besides, there's still time
             left.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.146
  You can come back and slay.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.116
 - I like to play with my dad.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.752
 He plays it differently, more
              fun.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.721
   - Well, how does he do it?

24:19.058 --> 24:20.224
          - Different.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.892
 Just wait 'til dad gets back.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.829
   - Daddy's not coming back.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.297
       - Don't say that!

24:26.298 --> 24:27.764
- Yeah, Katie, don't, don't say
             that.

24:27.767 --> 24:28.666
          Jim's right.

24:29.769 --> 24:30.901
        - But it's true.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.971
    That's why mommy cries.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.842
      - Dad will be back!

24:37.844 --> 24:39.710
- Hey, guys, listen, you don't,

24:40.580 --> 24:41.779
 don't have to worry about it,
             okay?

24:41.781 --> 24:43.180
     He'll, he'll be back.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.854
        (dramatic music)

24:55.761 --> 24:56.694
           Hey, Bri?

24:58.798 --> 24:59.897
        Can you hear me?

25:03.836 --> 25:04.768
            I um...

25:04.770 --> 25:08.005
I just wanted to tell you that I
           love you.

25:09.242 --> 25:11.141
You know, that-that we all love
              you.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.780
        Please wake up.

25:19.118 --> 25:23.120
 (Marilyn sniffling and crying)

25:38.638 --> 25:42.106
   I'm gonna need you to stay
    with me, you understand?

25:44.243 --> 25:47.244
    You made me promise that
    you would look after me,

25:47.246 --> 25:49.847
 and that job is not done yet,
             okay?

25:51.284 --> 25:53.317
 Jim and Katie, they need you.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.653
      Mary Beth needs you.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.921
    We all need you, Brian.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.961
 - Hey, Elaine, it's Mary Beth.

26:07.833 --> 26:08.699
           I'm okay.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.167
      Um, is Henry there?

26:10.169 --> 26:11.969
 I've called a couple times...

26:13.739 --> 26:15.239
  Okay, well, I just think it
           would help

26:15.241 --> 26:17.308
 if maybe the guys would just,
           you know,

26:17.310 --> 26:19.043
     stop by or something.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.179
  I mean, he's in Chicago now,
 so the drive won't be so far.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.247
      - I'll let him know.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.751
      - Okay, yeah, um...

26:27.753 --> 26:29.687
 Please tell him that I called.

26:29.689 --> 26:30.588
            - Sure.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.091
    I'm so sorry, Mary Beth.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.059
       - Thanks, Elaine.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.333
 - Henry, you really should go
            see him.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.269
           - I know.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.071
     I just feel so guilty.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.675
     We-we should have done
           something.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.311
        (dramatic music)

27:06.792 --> 27:10.127
    (heart monitor beeping)

27:12.698 --> 27:15.265
- I knew something would happen.

27:18.371 --> 27:21.071
His mother said the same thing.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.975
I shouldn't have let him leave.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.178
     - It's not your fault.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.082
     - That piece of shit.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.884
  Sue him to the fuckin' moon,
           Mary Beth.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.252
    Sue him and that shitty
     hospital that thought

27:35.254 --> 27:36.854
    he was taking a siesta.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.689
- Okay, we'll look into it, Joe.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.324
 There are bigger issues right
              now.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.761
     I'm focusing on Brian
     getting through this.

27:43.763 --> 27:47.197
- That guy deserves to be behind
             bars.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.766
       - [Joe] Or worse.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.833
   - I'm good with that too.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.935
    - Stop it, both of you.

27:52.972 --> 27:56.073
      (Mary Beth sighing)

27:56.075 --> 27:57.007
             Hey...

28:01.414 --> 28:02.946
          - Excuse me.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.348
  - Doc, is he getting better?

28:05.251 --> 28:07.051
  - Actually, he's regressing.

28:07.053 --> 28:10.220
    Um, when he is awake, he
     doesn't say that much,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.289
   and quickly goes back out.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.724
Seems like his only good moments

28:13.726 --> 28:15.292
are when his family and friends
           are here.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.396
      - What is she doing?

28:19.397 --> 28:20.830
     - Well, the nurses do
     a routine sternum rub.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.033
     It's just to stimulate
    some sort of a reaction.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.034
 - [Brian] What are you doing?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.102
        - Um, like that.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.771
       - Hey, hey Brian.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.174
          Hey, Brian.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.977
  - You pussy motherfucker...

28:35.414 --> 28:36.847
 - Why is he talking like that?

28:36.848 --> 28:38.281
   He never uses that kind of
           language.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.017
   - He has no idea what he's
            saying.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.220
   Basically, imagine if you
   took all of his thoughts,

28:43.222 --> 28:46.123
   put 'em in a blender, and
   then just poured them out.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.926
  - Shut up douchebag, please.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.829
        (Brian mumbling)
     - Okay, but I-I mean,

28:51.831 --> 28:55.933
   that's, that's still good,
             right?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.935
   - Uh, yeah, we'll take it.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.109
        (siren wailing)

29:05.111 --> 29:07.778
    - I know you're focused
      on Brian right now,

29:09.281 --> 29:11.081
   and as well you should be,
             but...

29:13.219 --> 29:15.319
  We need to talk about Ricky
            Stubbs.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.222
       - What about him?

29:20.459 --> 29:23.961
- He has to pay for what he did.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.863
 - Steve, I can't do this right
              now.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.164
   - Look, that piece of shit

29:27.166 --> 29:29.366
 didn't even get arrested that
             night.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.303
 I mean, the police talked to a
          few people,

29:33.305 --> 29:36.173
 even though everyone knew what
           happened,

29:36.175 --> 29:38.108
nobody actually saw it go down.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.477
       - Please, Steve--

29:40.479 --> 29:42.446
  - They know that Stubbs did
             this!

29:42.448 --> 29:43.380
         They know it!

29:44.517 --> 29:45.816
     What are we gonna do?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.788
            (scoffs)

29:50.790 --> 29:55.359
     - Steve, I, my husband
   is dying in the hospital.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.796
    I have two kids at home,

29:58.798 --> 30:01.131
confused as all hell about their
             daddy.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.836
    I can't worry about that
  asshole right now, I can't!

30:07.306 --> 30:09.439
   All I care about is Brian
     getting through this.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.275
          That is it.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.943
             Okay?

30:12.945 --> 30:16.046
  So, you do what you feel you
          have to do.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.515
 But I know what I have to do.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.588
         (somber music)

30:35.301 --> 30:38.235
       (Brian screaming)

30:51.617 --> 30:54.151
   I should have been there.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.986
- Okay, you are here more than I
              am,

30:55.988 --> 30:57.588
   and I get paid to be here.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.857
 - He was probably so scared to
           be alone.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.293
  - Well, I suspect he was in
  too much pain to feel fear.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.464
  Look, Brian has had a bleed
    into his spinal column,

31:07.466 --> 31:09.533
     and this has caused an
   injury to the nerve root,

31:09.535 --> 31:12.135
which in turn has caused severe
           back pain.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.273
      And now, here's the
      controversial part.

31:16.275 --> 31:21.144
  I recommend removing part of
  the left front temporal lobe

31:21.146 --> 31:22.880
in order to relieve some of the
           pressure.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.215
     This will also aid in
preventing any additional damage

31:25.217 --> 31:26.350
   to the rest of the brain.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.284
             - Oh!
             - Mom!

31:27.286 --> 31:30.120
- I think we need to set up this
           procedure

31:30.122 --> 31:31.572
      as soon as possible.

31:31.573 --> 31:33.023
  As a matter of fact, I would
  like to schedule the surgery

31:33.025 --> 31:34.625
     for tomorrow morning.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.226
     - If there is any more
     talk about cutting out

31:36.228 --> 31:37.527
 a piece of my husband's brain,

31:37.529 --> 31:38.629
  I will take him out of here

31:38.631 --> 31:41.932
   into another facility, Dr.
           Synkowski.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.001
- I understand your trepidation,

31:44.003 --> 31:46.904
  but the fact that Brian has
 slipped back into a deep coma

31:46.906 --> 31:49.172
      more than two weeks
    after the initial injury

31:49.174 --> 31:52.409
   suggests that we will not
     have a good prognosis.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.146
  Mary Beth, your husband has
            suffered

31:56.148 --> 31:58.115
a severe traumatic brain injury.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.218
  Excessive compression of an
  area such as the brain stem,

32:01.220 --> 32:02.686
    which is responsible for
           regulating

32:02.688 --> 32:04.488
  consciousness and breathing

32:04.490 --> 32:08.325
      can lead to extreme
         disabilities.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.259
           Or death.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.963
 - So then what, if you do it?

32:14.066 --> 32:17.134
    He turns into "One Flew
    Over the Cuckoo's Nest",

32:17.136 --> 32:20.087
         or something?

32:20.088 --> 32:23.039
   - Doctor, I think what my
 mom is trying to find out is,

32:23.042 --> 32:25.542
  what kind of person is Brian
          going to be

32:25.544 --> 32:27.010
    if he gets this surgery?

32:28.514 --> 32:32.249
  - Unfortunately, there is no
   definitive answer to that.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.451
- So we're just rolling the dice
             then?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.320
    I mean, I get that he's
      in a coma right now

32:36.322 --> 32:39.323
  and our options are limited,
   but Jesus Christ, I mean--

32:39.325 --> 32:42.726
     - Doc, are you saying
    this will save his life?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.261
  - [Dr. Synkowski] There's no
          guarantees.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.297
     I'm saying that I feel
    this is his best option.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.569
  - And if he was your family,
           your son,

32:53.505 --> 32:55.639
 is this the decision that you
          would make?

32:56.575 --> 32:58.342
     - Without hesitation.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.211
        (dramatic music)

33:03.182 --> 33:06.049
     Okay, I'll prepare the
           paperwork.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.611
    - Brian has received his
          sacraments,

33:35.614 --> 33:37.481
  and now the rest is in God's
             hands.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.583
          Have faith.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.552
      - Thank you, Father.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.056
Don't forget Bri, you promised.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.294
     - [Mr. Sweeney] Miss,
  could you give us a minute?

33:51.296 --> 33:52.229
         - Absolutely.

33:54.767 --> 33:55.732
             - Hey.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.802
   You're not going anywhere.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.072
 So you might as well wake up.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.677
  Please Bri, please wake up.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.213
          I need you.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.451
   I need you baby, please...

34:16.121 --> 34:18.255
    (Brian clearing throat)

34:18.257 --> 34:19.188
              Bri?

34:21.060 --> 34:21.942
             Brian?

34:21.943 --> 34:22.824
          - Oh, Brian!
         - Oh sweetie!

34:23.728 --> 34:28.264
          - Oh my God!
        (all chattering)

34:28.266 --> 34:29.800
            - Mary?
          - Yes, baby.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.275
       - Oh, the doctor!

34:41.280 --> 34:43.112
  - Brian, it's Dr. Synkowski.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.181
      How are you feeling?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.617
      - I've been better.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.768
 - I think we can postpone the
            surgery.

35:04.770 --> 35:09.840
          - Oh my God!
        (all chattering)

35:27.526 --> 35:29.893
          (rock music)

35:34.233 --> 35:36.233
  - [Jenny] Here you go, boys.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.134
         - Thanks, hun.

35:39.338 --> 35:40.737
        - Somebody die?

35:40.739 --> 35:42.772
You guys look depressed as hell.

35:42.774 --> 35:43.740
            - Brian.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.711
 Brian had an accident, he's...

35:47.713 --> 35:48.712
       Not in good shape.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.249
  - Oh my God, what happened?

35:53.218 --> 35:54.684
      Is he gonna be okay?

35:54.686 --> 35:55.619
        - He'll be fine.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.421
      We're just a little
    pissed that he got hurt.

35:59.424 --> 36:00.857
     Thanks for the drinks.

36:02.794 --> 36:03.760
            - Sure.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.164
    These are on the house.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.367
     - [Henry] Thanks, Jen.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.745
  - We should have been there.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.680
We gotta go see him, he probably
            feels--

36:23.682 --> 36:25.782
 - I just can't right now, man.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.285
     I can't fuckin' stand
     to see him like that,

36:28.287 --> 36:29.786
     and I don't even know
    if I can look Mary Beth

36:29.788 --> 36:30.887
     in the eye right now.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.623
   - It's not about you, man.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.725
       It's not about us.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.360
   I feel guilty as hell too,

36:37.362 --> 36:39.930
  but he can't feel like we're
    turning out back on him!

36:40.899 --> 36:41.932
        He's our friend!

36:41.934 --> 36:45.535
    I don't understand, why
wouldn't you want to go see him?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.903
  - Don't tell me how to feel,
             Kevin!

36:46.905 --> 36:49.706
  - All right, that's enough,
            fellas.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.607
        Just calm down.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.519
 - As with other TBI survivors,

37:02.521 --> 37:03.920
Brian's recovery is dependent on

37:03.922 --> 37:06.289
how quickly we can start working
           with him.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.624
     - Okay, what do I do?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.392
 - Well, being as for the past
           two weeks,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.528
     he's been able to stay
     awake during the day,

37:11.530 --> 37:13.230
      and the fact that we
     no longer consider him

37:13.232 --> 37:15.365
   a candidate for surgery--
     (Mary Beth chuckling)

37:15.367 --> 37:17.500
    I think we can start the
    rehabilitation process.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.970
  It is vital to his recovery.

37:19.972 --> 37:21.238
      - Whatever it takes.

37:34.353 --> 37:37.020
        (dramatic music)

37:45.564 --> 37:46.830
            - Brian?

37:46.832 --> 37:47.797
           You okay?

37:50.936 --> 37:51.868
            - Fine.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.593
    - [Dwayne] What's this?

38:17.462 --> 38:19.329
           - A bird.
       - Good, one more,

38:19.331 --> 38:21.731
   and then we're gonna start
    from the top, all right?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.666
            - Okay.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.436
       - Just get off me!

38:28.307 --> 38:29.839
      I don't belong here!

38:29.841 --> 38:30.907
     What are these people?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.609
      I don't belong here!

38:32.611 --> 38:33.743
   Get the fuck away from me!

38:33.745 --> 38:34.878
Dude, get the fuck away from me!

38:34.880 --> 38:36.846
   - Amber, go get security.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.849
  - I'm not like these people!

38:39.851 --> 38:41.751
    I don't belong, back up!

38:41.753 --> 38:43.320
 - [Dwayne] Hey, It's cool man.

38:43.322 --> 38:46.589
   - It's not cool, it's not
         fucking cool!

38:49.094 --> 38:50.860
      I don't belong here!

38:52.631 --> 38:55.765
  I wanna go home, I wanna go
             home!

38:55.767 --> 38:58.535
I don't belong here, goddamn it!

39:03.008 --> 39:04.708
       I wanna go home...

39:13.819 --> 39:16.886
   What do you mean, what do
    you mean start talking?

39:16.888 --> 39:18.121
      Where's my pudding?

39:18.123 --> 39:19.422
        Come on, bitch!
            - Brian!

39:19.424 --> 39:20.857
          Brian, stop!

39:21.793 --> 39:24.627
     What-what's happening?
        - What the fuck?

39:24.629 --> 39:26.429
       - He is all yours.
      - I will smash you--

39:26.431 --> 39:28.098
  - How come he's acting like
             this?

39:28.100 --> 39:30.567
- He became violent in the rehab
            center,

39:30.569 --> 39:32.902
and is demanding to leave, okay?

39:32.904 --> 39:35.939
 He is not cooperating at all.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.541
 You have to take your husband
             home.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.010
      - What am, what am I
    supposed to do with him?

39:41.012 --> 39:42.379
          Brian, stop.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.419
        (Brian sobbing)

39:49.421 --> 39:51.855
 - [Brian] Take me home, Mare.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.825
      I don't belong here.
         - Okay, okay.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.695
        (dramatic music)

40:05.804 --> 40:06.770
             Wait.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.547
      You wanna sit down?

40:52.884 --> 40:54.217
        Good night, Bri.

40:56.221 --> 40:59.856
    (Brian grumbling softly)

41:18.643 --> 41:21.511
        (birds chirping)

41:27.886 --> 41:30.119
       Yes, once a week.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.489
That's all I can work right now.

41:32.491 --> 41:33.990
 I've explained this all in the
           paperwork

41:33.992 --> 41:35.525
 a couple of weeks ago when my
            husband

41:35.527 --> 41:37.160
    was kicked out of rehab.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.095
He needs my full attention right
              now.

41:41.967 --> 41:42.932
        Okay, thank you.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.034
              Bye.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.508
   Katie, I can give you more
 of your own if you're hungry.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.610
    Please don't touch your
           father's.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.979
    Honey, you have to eat.

41:57.282 --> 42:00.149
   - No, I need to go to the
        hardware store.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.184
 - Okay, I'll drive you, Brian.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.218
    What do we need from the
        hardware store?

42:02.220 --> 42:03.152
           - Mm-mmm.

42:04.556 --> 42:07.056
I need more pop, but I can drive
            myself.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.174
       - [Mary Beth] No.

42:08.175 --> 42:09.291
- Brian, you'll be driving soon
            enough,

42:09.294 --> 42:11.594
  but it's just, it's too soon
           now, okay?

42:12.931 --> 42:15.031
    - I can drive just fine.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.200
   - [Mary Beth] You haven't
 eaten since you've been home.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.635
            Please.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.703
         - I'm thirsty.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.105
  I need to go to the hardware
             store.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.973
- They sell pop at the hardware
             store?

42:23.975 --> 42:25.608
            - Yeah.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.777
 - Okay, but you can't live on
           pop, Bri.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.145
        You need to eat.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.647
- Look Bri, you gotta eat, okay?

42:30.649 --> 42:31.814
 You love cheeseburgers, right?

42:31.816 --> 42:33.650
  - Come on, I want more Coke!

42:33.652 --> 42:36.085
        Hardware store!
          - Okay, hey.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.820
       Look at me, okay?

42:39.257 --> 42:41.257
    If you eat that burger,
   I'll take you for a ride,

42:41.259 --> 42:43.860
     and we'll get more pop
   or wherever you wanna go.

42:46.731 --> 42:49.032
  - I don't want to go to the
             store.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.067
     I want to play a game.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.101
    - That's fine, I can, I
    can stay and watch them.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.170
          - Thank you.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.315
All right, do you see anything?

43:14.893 --> 43:18.695
   Honey, we have enough pop
   to last us a while, okay?

43:18.697 --> 43:21.331
  Let's try and find something
 to eat that looks good to you.

43:23.702 --> 43:25.234
      We have enough, Bri!

43:25.236 --> 43:27.203
    Come on, you need food!

43:27.205 --> 43:29.639
   We need to find something
       you'll eat, stop!

43:30.342 --> 43:31.374
     - [Brian] What do you
     want me to eat, Mare?

43:31.376 --> 43:32.726
    - [Mary Beth] Anything!

43:32.727 --> 43:34.077
      - Pick something, or
    you want me to pick it?

43:34.079 --> 43:36.145
       Great, what, dip?

43:36.147 --> 43:38.081
         Need some dip.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.116
       Here we go, chips.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.401
        Oh, more chips.

43:41.402 --> 43:42.685
   - Mister, you need to calm
         yourself down

43:42.687 --> 43:44.854
    before I do it for you.
      - Let's just do it.

43:44.856 --> 43:47.690
    You gonna calm me down,
         motherfucker?

43:47.692 --> 43:49.092
         Calm me down.

43:49.094 --> 43:50.226
         Calm me down!

43:53.932 --> 43:55.865
         There, there!

43:55.867 --> 43:57.166
         Eat up, pussy!
            - Brian!

43:57.168 --> 43:58.868
       - [Brian] Eat 'em!

44:01.006 --> 44:03.857
        - I am so sorry.

44:03.858 --> 44:06.709
   I am so sorry, please let
   me explain, I'm so sorry.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.888
        (Brian groaning)

44:41.880 --> 44:44.047
           (sighing)

44:53.425 --> 44:57.694
(muted television conversation)

45:00.899 --> 45:03.766
        (dramatic music)

45:45.777 --> 45:47.276
       (loud rock music)
 (loud television conversation)

45:47.278 --> 45:48.211
            - Brian!

46:03.461 --> 46:04.393
             Brian!

46:12.070 --> 46:14.671
             Brian!

46:14.672 --> 46:17.273
    ¶ I'm rolling down into
          dreamland ¶

46:19.978 --> 46:21.878
   - Why are you blasting the
             music?

46:23.281 --> 46:24.213
             Brian?

46:25.550 --> 46:27.016
       Hey, are you okay?

46:32.290 --> 46:33.823
  - Where are my power tools?

46:35.894 --> 46:37.360
      - I'm not sure, Bri.

46:37.362 --> 46:38.861
     Packed away somewhere.

46:40.532 --> 46:43.332
   You need to take a shower,
  it'll make you feel better.

46:45.236 --> 46:46.969
- I want to build us a new deck.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.339
            - Okay.

46:52.010 --> 46:54.010
     That'd be nice, uh...

46:55.079 --> 46:59.248
   Hey listen, so someone is
    coming over for a visit.

47:00.285 --> 47:01.851
We gotta get you in the shower.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.219
      (Mary Beth clapping)
            - Great.

47:04.923 --> 47:07.490
    - There are a couple of
  reasons for my visit today.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.458
     Not only did I want to
     come by and say hello

47:09.460 --> 47:12.328
  and see how you were doing,
 but I wanted to give you this.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.065
     - Do you like to jog?

47:16.067 --> 47:17.266
         Are you fast?

47:17.268 --> 47:18.968
        I'm really fast.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.570
   Do you want to go jogging?

47:20.572 --> 47:24.106
  - Uh, yeah, I like to jog, I
            suppose.

47:24.108 --> 47:26.008
     Not sure how fast I am
           nowadays--

47:26.010 --> 47:26.876
       - I'm really fast.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.010
    We-we can go right now.

47:28.012 --> 47:32.215
   - A-anyway, this is a call
   log from all your clients.

47:34.252 --> 47:36.219
 Does he remember work at all?

47:37.188 --> 47:40.990
 - I'm uh, I'm right here, you
          can ask me.

47:40.992 --> 47:43.492
- I'm sorry pal, just after your
           accident,

47:43.494 --> 47:45.127
  the clients called in, some
             daily,

47:45.129 --> 47:47.430
     to check in on you and
    see how you were doing.

47:47.432 --> 47:49.932
 And that's a call log from all
            of them.

47:51.069 --> 47:54.203
     - That's great, that's
      so kind of everyone.

47:54.205 --> 47:57.073
  Please extend our gratitude
  from us if they call again.

47:58.409 --> 48:01.544
     - Also, your coworkers
    took it upon themselves

48:01.546 --> 48:03.346
    to put together a little
      collection for you,

48:03.348 --> 48:04.914
after they heard what happened.

48:04.916 --> 48:07.016
 - I'm-I'm ready to go back to
          work again.

48:07.652 --> 48:09.318
   - Mary Beth, as you know,

48:09.320 --> 48:11.921
 Brian has a lot of friends at
          the office.

48:11.923 --> 48:13.289
 And you know, we just want you
            to know

48:13.291 --> 48:15.958
    that you've been in our
     minds this whole time.

48:16.995 --> 48:17.960
         - Oh my gosh.

48:17.962 --> 48:21.097
   Once again, please, thank
        everyone for us.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.199
    This is beyond gracious.

48:23.201 --> 48:25.635
   This means so much to us.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.621
   - We just want you to know

48:28.622 --> 48:29.971
    that your family doesn't
      ever have to worry,

48:29.974 --> 48:32.408
   'cause it seems that Brian
           qualifies

48:32.410 --> 48:34.143
   for permanent disability.

48:35.380 --> 48:38.214
     - Oh, uh, well, thank
    you, but don't you think

48:38.216 --> 48:41.017
 it's a little too soon to make
           that call?

48:41.019 --> 48:42.418
I mean, I'd like to wait and see

48:42.420 --> 48:44.587
  how his rehabilitation goes.

48:44.589 --> 48:47.990
  - Well, if Brian accepts the
  permanent disability offer,

48:47.992 --> 48:49.926
then he can take all the time he
             needs.

48:49.928 --> 48:52.395
     He doesn't have to go
    back to work right away.

48:52.397 --> 48:54.563
He shouldn't even have to think
           about it.

48:54.565 --> 48:56.132
       - I'm right here!

48:57.201 --> 48:59.969
God, quit treating me like I'm a
             child!

49:01.039 --> 49:02.705
    I can walk, I can drive,

49:02.707 --> 49:05.141
   I can do everything I did
            before!

49:07.712 --> 49:09.679
   I want to go back to work!

49:12.116 --> 49:13.049
           Douchebag!

49:26.965 --> 49:28.314
          I can work!

49:28.315 --> 49:29.664
  - Bri, Bri, he won't let you
           come back.

49:29.667 --> 49:31.500
  You're not well enough yet.

49:31.502 --> 49:34.503
  I'm gonna find you someplace
      good to rehab, okay?

49:34.505 --> 49:37.473
     I promise, we'll just
   start there and see what--

49:37.475 --> 49:39.976
   - No, I'm not fucking back
             there!

49:39.978 --> 49:42.729
       (glass shattering)

49:42.730 --> 49:45.481
      I'm not, goddamn it!
   - Hey, stop it right now!

49:45.483 --> 49:46.415
             Stop!

49:50.188 --> 49:51.520
     Don't fucking do that!

49:52.623 --> 49:55.491
        (dramatic music)

50:15.513 --> 50:18.014
    I'm sorry, I just don't
     know where else to go.

50:18.016 --> 50:18.748
         He needs help.

50:18.750 --> 50:20.483
         We need help.

50:20.485 --> 50:21.584
    - Mary Beth, you have to
           understand

50:21.586 --> 50:23.652
    that Brian's actions are
          symptomatic

50:23.654 --> 50:25.388
of the damage that was sustained

50:25.390 --> 50:28.024
      to the injury to the
   left front temporal lobe.

50:28.026 --> 50:32.361
    Uh, well, his short term
  memory and cognitive ability

50:32.363 --> 50:34.630
  will be compromised as well.

50:34.632 --> 50:36.499
      Most likely, Brian,

50:36.501 --> 50:38.234
     he won't remember some
     of the things he does,

50:38.236 --> 50:39.986
even minutes after he's done it.

50:39.987 --> 50:41.737
    There's a chance he will
     not recognize people,

50:41.739 --> 50:44.774
     or even understand who
     they are in his life.

50:44.776 --> 50:48.411
   - Well, he started having
    these outbursts of anger

50:48.413 --> 50:50.279
  that I've never seen before.

50:50.281 --> 50:51.380
     I mean, we have kids.

50:52.216 --> 50:53.082
           - I know.

50:53.084 --> 50:54.483
     Well, it's a concern.

50:54.485 --> 50:56.519
    I can only tell you that

50:56.520 --> 50:58.554
     this is going to be a
   challenging time for your
            family.

50:58.556 --> 51:01.057
 Look, I want you to call this
   number when you get home.

51:01.059 --> 51:03.192
    By the time you call, I
  will have spoken with them,

51:03.194 --> 51:04.827
     and they will tell you
     when to bring Brian in

51:04.829 --> 51:06.796
  to start the rehabilitation
            process.

51:06.798 --> 51:08.764
 - [Mary Beth] But nobody will
           take him.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.666
- Call that number when you get
             home.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.836
           (sighing)

51:13.838 --> 51:15.638
      - Dr. Synkowski I...

51:17.208 --> 51:18.541
    I don't have the words.

51:18.543 --> 51:20.409
  You are just the best, thank
              you.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.279
  - Those words are fine, and
           accurate.

51:24.315 --> 51:25.648
       - Have a good day.
     - You too, Mary Beth.

51:25.650 --> 51:26.816
       I'll see you soon.

51:49.574 --> 51:52.575
       (doorbell ringing)

51:57.482 --> 51:59.815
- Hey man, your total is $14.50.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.395
       (change rattling)

52:29.480 --> 52:32.381
     - Yeah, oh, sorry man.

52:33.885 --> 52:34.817
        Thanks, keep it.

52:36.220 --> 52:37.153
          Hey, Brian?

52:38.456 --> 52:41.357
      (upbeat rock music)

52:41.359 --> 52:42.858
          Eat up, bud.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.546
         Extra sausage.

52:47.547 --> 52:48.796
 I know how much you like extra
            sausage.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.166
         - No I don't.

52:51.903 --> 52:55.404
  Hey, so uh, Henry and uh...

52:57.575 --> 52:59.058
         The other one.

52:59.059 --> 53:00.542
            - Kevin.
    - Yeah, yeah, I thought,

53:00.545 --> 53:01.877
  I thought they were coming?

53:03.214 --> 53:06.448
    - Bri, they feel really
    bad about what happened.

53:07.385 --> 53:09.485
     - They-they shouldn't.

53:09.487 --> 53:10.419
           I mean...

53:12.890 --> 53:14.590
         You know what?

53:14.592 --> 53:16.425
    We should all go bowling
           together.

53:18.196 --> 53:20.329
 - A little soon for that, no?

53:20.331 --> 53:22.331
     - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

53:22.333 --> 53:27.403
 I mean, this looks a lot worse
          than it is.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.773
   I'm, uh, I'm almost fully
           recovered.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.608
         - Fair enough.
         - Yeah, yeah.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.348
- [Joe] Don't worry about that,
             buddy.

53:40.818 --> 53:42.218
   Those bottles are tricky.

53:45.289 --> 53:48.791
       (car horn honking)

53:48.793 --> 53:49.625
         - [Brian] Hey.

53:49.627 --> 53:50.693
       - [Mary Beth] Hey.

53:50.694 --> 53:51.760
  - [Joe] You win the lotto or
           something?

53:51.762 --> 53:52.995
           - Sort of.
         (Joe laughing)

53:52.997 --> 53:55.331
     Brian, you're going to
    the best rehab facility

53:55.333 --> 53:56.599
         in the state.

53:56.601 --> 53:58.367
      - That's great news!
             - Yes!

53:58.369 --> 53:59.802
     I mean, paying for it
   will be a different story,

53:59.804 --> 54:02.238
 but what matters is Brian will
          finally get

54:02.240 --> 54:03.672
       the help he needs.

54:03.674 --> 54:04.807
     - I'm not going there.

54:06.310 --> 54:07.776
   - You have to go to rehab,
             Brian.

54:07.778 --> 54:08.944
    You have to get better.

54:11.282 --> 54:12.014
          - I'm fine.

54:13.284 --> 54:15.417
           I'm good.
    - Hey, you're not fine.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.186
  You're still in pain, honey,

54:17.187 --> 54:18.954
     and your outbursts are
    becoming more frequent.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.857
Hey, this is a good thing, okay?

54:23.928 --> 54:25.661
        - I'm not going.

54:25.663 --> 54:26.595
           I'm fine!

54:29.533 --> 54:32.768
  ¶ You better watch out, you
   better not make me late ¶

54:32.770 --> 54:34.937
    ¶ I say hey, hey, hey ¶

54:34.939 --> 54:36.538
        - Later, Brian.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.474
     I'll set up the whole
   bowling thing, no worries.

54:38.476 --> 54:39.408
         - Sounds good.

54:40.711 --> 54:41.644
         I'll be there.

54:42.747 --> 54:45.848
     ¶ Sweet home Chicago ¶

54:56.494 --> 54:57.426
             - Mmm.

54:58.529 --> 55:00.863
- Did you enjoy having Joe over?

55:00.865 --> 55:02.364
             - Mmm.

55:02.366 --> 55:03.065
            - Yeah?

55:06.671 --> 55:08.570
            - Mare?
         - Yeah, Brian?

55:10.541 --> 55:12.641
 - Am I doing better than I was
           yesterday?

55:13.678 --> 55:15.811
- [Mary Beth] Yes, yes you are.

55:19.517 --> 55:22.685
         - [Brian] Hmm.

55:22.687 --> 55:23.952
    - [Mary Beth] So, we're
     starting your therapy

55:23.954 --> 55:25.688
   in a couple of days, Bri.

55:25.690 --> 55:26.722
        Are you excited?

55:29.360 --> 55:31.794
    - I don't need therapy!

55:31.796 --> 55:33.362
   I'm not like those people.

55:33.363 --> 55:34.929
     How many fucking times
      do I have to say it?

55:34.932 --> 55:36.565
      - I think we should
    give them a try, Brian.

55:36.567 --> 55:38.667
     I think they can help.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.903
       - No, they can't.

55:40.905 --> 55:43.072
That place is for crazy people.

55:43.874 --> 55:45.607
             Fuck!
     - Brian, you're going!

55:45.609 --> 55:46.792
             Okay?

55:46.793 --> 55:47.976
  You have to get better, Dr.
             Syn--

55:47.978 --> 55:49.511
         - Goddamn it!

55:49.513 --> 55:51.680
         (tense music)

55:51.682 --> 55:53.549
     - Brian, no, Brian...

55:57.455 --> 56:01.390
 (Mary Beth breathing shakily)

56:05.429 --> 56:06.628
         - Oh my God...

56:17.808 --> 56:20.843
       (Mary Beth crying)

56:31.822 --> 56:34.690
        (dramatic music)

57:03.921 --> 57:05.187
        - Running away?

57:09.727 --> 57:10.993
       - Going to rehab.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.165
    I can't hurt you, Mare.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.668
     I can't hurt the kids.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.139
I don't know who this person is.

57:32.883 --> 57:34.616
I just want to be myself again.

57:41.892 --> 57:43.492
       I'm so, so sorry.

57:47.965 --> 57:52.100
      I didn't think I was
    capable of hurting you.

58:01.212 --> 58:05.614
    I didn't think I needed
   rehab, but obviously I do,

58:06.484 --> 58:10.252
      if I could just turn
   into a monster like that.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.491
      My mind, it's so...

58:16.861 --> 58:18.093
     I'm just so confused.

58:20.097 --> 58:22.898
 I-I-I don't get it, I-I just,

58:24.802 --> 58:28.837
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.573
         (Brian crying)

58:41.652 --> 58:44.853
- [Mary Beth] You didn't mean to
            do that.

58:44.855 --> 58:47.222
  They're gonna help you, Bri.

58:48.592 --> 58:49.925
       I know they will.

58:51.562 --> 58:54.229
  - I love you, I love you so
             much.

59:16.787 --> 59:18.404
 - Don't worry about finishing.

59:18.405 --> 59:20.022
  Let's focus on starting and
seeing how far we can get, okay?

59:20.024 --> 59:20.956
            - Okay.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.928
     - How is this supposed
    to make me feel better?

59:25.930 --> 59:27.763
- Jon, we've been through this.

59:27.765 --> 59:28.931
 This will strengthen your arms

59:28.932 --> 59:30.098
 and get your coordination back
           on track.

59:30.100 --> 59:33.702
 - My arms and coordination are
             fine!

59:33.704 --> 59:35.904
- Okay, keep doing the work and
            show me.

59:37.174 --> 59:38.574
           - Asshole.

59:38.576 --> 59:39.341
          - Excuse me?

59:39.343 --> 59:40.275
           - Not you.

59:41.579 --> 59:42.311
         Well, you too.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.281
        (Brian groaning)

59:46.283 --> 59:47.816
   - Who's crying over there?

59:48.686 --> 59:49.618
    I didn't know this was a
            nursery.

59:49.620 --> 59:51.587
    I thought it was rehab.

59:51.589 --> 59:52.321
         - Go to hell.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.191
  - Jon, go resume your work.

59:56.193 --> 59:58.894
   - Ashley, men are talking,
      go clean something.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.697
        (Brian grunting)
     What happened to you?

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.866
    - None of your business.

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:07.069
- [Jon] Oh, he doesn't like me,
            Ashley.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:09.104
- Oh, it's hard to imagine why.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.772
        - No, it's not.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.507
         He's a prick.

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:14.241
    - Well, finish that step
   and do something about it.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.078
 - Now, that's not appropriate.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.913
  - At least I'm not grunting
   over here like a porn star

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:18.814
       giving me a woody.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.015
    - You call that a woody?

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.751
     I feel sorry for your
          girlfriend.

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:25.387
  - What'd you just say to me?

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.790
        (Brian grunting)

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.058
    - Good, great job Brian.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.159
        (clapping) Whoo!

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.029
   You're awesome, all right.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.397
  Way to go, how do you feel?

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.309
          - Hi, Brian.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:52.914
      How was rehab today?

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.684
            - Fine.

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:56.418
            - Good.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.655
      That's a cool medal.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:05.227
- Yeah, my sister gave it to me.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.062
        - That's sweet.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:09.831
         Can I see it?

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:15.137
            - Yeah.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:20.308
          - Thank you.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.051
            - Uh...

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:36.858
- So, when this timer goes off,

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:38.927
  ask me for your medal back,

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.329
   and I will give it to you.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.264
             Okay?

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:46.201
       - Ask for it back?
            - Mmhmm.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.470
This goes off, ask for it back.

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:53.275
       - Okay, then what?

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:54.176
        Coloring blocks?

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.480
   - Your brain was injured,
    and we have to rehab it.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:02.284
     And that comes in the
   form of reading, writing,

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:05.954
 memorization exercises, focus
 tasks, and critical thinking.

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:15.330
   (puzzle pieces clattering)

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:21.870
    - So we, we are talking
  about color, coloring books?

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.406
  I mean, this is, this is kid
             stuff.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:25.908
        These are toys.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.409
 - Well then, show me you don't
           need them.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.113
           Red nine.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.518
  - I know what a red nine is,
              doc.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.333
      - Very good, Brian.

01:02:52.136 --> 01:02:53.068
          Quite good.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.187
           Very good.

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:26.434
        (timer beeping)

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.406
 Do you need something from me,
             Brian?

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:36.444
         - Um, mm-mmm.
             - No?

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.345
             Okay.

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:51.593
        - Oh, thank you.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:52.894
 - [Dr. Jacobs] You're welcome.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.511
  - Mom, can we go to the toy
          store later?

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:12.480
    - We'll see how daddy's
    feeling a little later.

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:14.182
         Okay, sweetie?

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.883
 - Yeah, I wanna go to the toy
           store too.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.520
      - We're going home.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.424
    - Yes, we're going home.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.396
            - Home!

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:30.498
   (Brian pounding furiously)
    - Okay, everyone relax.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.435
            - Daddy!
 - Hey, everyone relax, relax.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:36.238
You can't do that Brian, do you
            hear me?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.505
              Bri!

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.107
        Do you hear me?

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.476
    You can't ever do that!

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:42.410
        Close the door!

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.981
   (Katie breathing heavily)
     It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.552
        Close the door.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.454
   Close the door, it's okay.

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:53.555
           It's okay.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:58.627
        (dramatic music)
        (water running)

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:19.681
              Bri?

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.154
   Hey, what did I say about
     running in the house?

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:29.157
  - If we did it again, you'd
  ship us off to Indian-Asia.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:30.292
     (Mary Beth chuckling)

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:31.960
          - Indonesia.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.629
Do you know what they do to kids
             there?

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.232
          Nobody does.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:38.934
             Whoa!
        (kids laughing)

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:40.101
      Where's your father?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.069
           - Outside.
            - What?

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:42.704
    What's he doing outside?

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:43.705
       - He's in the car.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:45.941
            - What?

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:49.010
      (suspenseful music)

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.394
             Brian?

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.563
         Whatcha doin'?

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:15.003
    - I was hoping maybe the
 driving thing would come back.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.240
Maybe even that I never lost it.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.010
      - I'm sorry, honey.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.480
  Do you want me to drive you
    around for a little bit?

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.022
            - Mare?

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:34.756
         - Yeah, Brian?

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.260
 - Am I doing better than I was
           yesterday?

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.131
   - Yes, Brian, yes you are.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:51.406
        (Brian grunting)

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:56.111
   - Hey, yeah, you're flyin'
         today, Brian.

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.512
           Nice job.
            - Yeah.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.848
  - It's only been a couple of
            months,

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.183
and you're puttin' in the work,
   you're seeing the results.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.385
       Great, great job.

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:05.353
 Hey uh, how are you sleeping?

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:08.356
            - Fine.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.458
  - How many hours do you get?

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.659
         - Uh, I dunno.

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:14.195
  - Can you keep track for me?

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:18.800
            - Okay.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.142
    - I've been through too
  much to deal with this shit!

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.576
      All of you motherf--
            - Stop!

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:30.512
            Stop it.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.482
   We're here to get better.

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:38.219
   - They're just making sure
   we don't get worse, moron!

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:40.422
             - No.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.826
  They're here to help us get
  back to how we were before.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:50.098
- Things will never be how they
  were before, you dumb shit.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.200
     There's no going back.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.502
    This is who we are now.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.538
   - Hey, you can get better,
             Brian.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:59.024
            - Yeah.

01:07:59.025 --> 01:08:00.542
    You can improve the same
  way waking up in the morning

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:02.544
     improves your chances
     of plowing Kate Upton

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:03.711
     later that afternoon.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:06.648
      - Okay, who is that?

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:07.749
      She sounds familiar.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.716
          - Seriously?

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.220
    Man, your eggs must have
     really got scrambled.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:13.855
 Everybody knows who Kate Upton
              is.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:18.158
  - Blonde, she has big boo...

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.261
   Blue eyes, the blue eyes.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.529
 She's in a lot of movies, guys
           love her.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:23.865
  I don't really see it, but,

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:27.167
 okay, you know, I totally see
              it.

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:29.804
         - Oh, oh, oh!

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.639
            - Yeah.
             - Ah.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.774
  - Oh, okay, yeah, she's hot.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.844
 - Yes, she's very pretty, yes.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:48.288
- So, when the timer goes off--

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.542
        (timer beeping)

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.794
  Ask me for your medal back,
             okay?

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:53.761
            - Okay.

01:08:57.767 --> 01:09:01.269
   - We're very excited about
    your progression, Brian.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.537
   You're working very hard.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.340
   - It's all for my family.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.408
       - What about you?

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.546
  - Without them, nothing else
            matters.

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.550
  - You love them, don't you?

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:17.285
            - I do.

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.795
       I choked my wife.

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:32.233
           - You did?

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:43.877
     - That's why I'm here.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.546
 That's why I'm busting my ass.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:48.316
      That's why I'm gonna
    continue to bust my ass,

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:52.819
   until I get better, 'cause
   that's what they deserve.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:56.791
         - Fair enough.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:07.235
        (timer beeping)

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:09.971
      - Can I have, uh...

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:18.780
      - [Dr. Jacobs] What?

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:25.520
        - Can I have...

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.420
  - What do you need from me,
             Brian?

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:31.326
         - Pop, a pop.

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:32.260
          I'm thirsty.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:34.729
            - Sure.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.779
    - He didn't even want to
  come up here this afternoon.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:53.848
            - Brian?

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:01.489
 - Bri, we drove all the way up
              here

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.958
 to speak with Ms. Clarkson and
           Mr. Hill.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.827
 Can you please just listen to
             them?

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.763
  They're gonna ask you a few
           questions.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:14.902
 - Brian, I uh, I do understand
     that this is something

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:17.939
    you probably don't want
      to talk about, okay?

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.375
      Now, being that you
   weren't at the pre-trial,

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.676
 you don't know that Mr. Stubbs

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:23.544
was charged with felony assault

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:24.846
  with the intent to do bodily
             harm,

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.614
 due to his attack against you.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.753
 - Look, Brian, your testimony

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:33.621
      can literally be the
  difference on whether or not

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.590
 he's convicted for what he did
            to you.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.827
 - Brian, it seems that you and
          your family

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.296
   have suffered quite a bit

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.464
due to Mr. Stubbs' actions that
            evening.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:46.034
     Now, we can make sure
     that he pays for that.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.703
     It's a felony charge.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:50.672
  - Not only that, but you can
          move forward

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:53.408
 on a civic case for additional
            damages.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.642
    - I'm not gonna testify.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:57.712
  I don't even want to attend.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:02.784
    I just want to focus on
 getting my life back together.

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:03.718
           That's it.

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:07.488
- Like I told you on the phone,

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.924
  he didn't want to go to the
           pre-trial,

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:11.759
 he didn't want to come up here
             today,

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:15.663
 and unfortunately, he doesn't
    want to go to the trial.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:21.803
  - Mr. Sweeney, we're banking
  on you as our star witness.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.971
It's imperative that you attend
           the trial.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:27.675
    - I don't remember much.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.377
   - That may be enough right
             there.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:30.878
    - It's not enough, it...

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.684
     - Are you okay, Brian?

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.686
- He gets headaches frequently.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:41.923
     - [Leslie] Did he get
  those before this happened?

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.743
             - No.

01:12:44.744 --> 01:12:47.562
   Nor did he have the memory
loss, or the violent outbursts.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:49.497
      - Violent outbursts?

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:51.432
      - Yes, very violent.

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:53.668
       And very intense.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:58.005
  He goes from zero to nuclear
    in a matter of seconds,

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.841
  and usually without warning.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.811
    The doctor told us that
    this was actually common

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:06.614
for someone with Brian's type of
            injury,

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.083
 but before this happened, he,

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:11.953
   he rarely lost his temper.

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:14.422
  - All the more reason to go
  after this guy, there's no--

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:16.591
     - We, uh, understand.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:19.827
  Look, we'll keep him on the
          witness list

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:22.029
  just in case he changes his
          mind, okay?

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:24.565
 I hope you feel better, Brian.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:26.901
   - Thank you, Mr. Sweeney.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.042
    - [Ashley] Keep working.

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:43.484
 - Look somewhere else, Sally.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.922
 - It looks like a little girl

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.656
 trying to play with a bowling
             ball.

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:50.591
         - Focus, Jon.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.629
   - You're really sweating.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:55.797
           Too heavy?

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.665
    Need a hand over there?

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.200
   - Keep talking, funny man.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.436
- Hey Ash, uh, should we step in
             there?

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.838
    - No, they talk crap to
    each other all the time.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.507
  I think it's good for them,
  the whole competition thing.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.510
- Did mommy forget to pack you a
              bag?

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:13.181
              Huh?
 - Looks like you wanna go huh?

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.016
           - Oh jeez!
           - Damn it!

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.851
- [Ashley] Hey, hey, stop that's
            enough!

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.786
      (trainers shouting)

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.888
         - Don't move!
            - Whoo!

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.156
           Yeah baby!

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:24.125
     - Let's go, let's go!
           - Come on!

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:28.796
            - Brian!
 - Hey, hey, down, down, down.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.631
     - [Ashley] Hey, stop.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:36.604
        - Unacceptable.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.673
You could have hurt yourselves,
           or worse,

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:39.941
   one of the other patients.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.175
      Mr. Sweeney, you've
   already been kicked out of

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:43.544
   a rehab facility for being
        violent, right?

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:45.680
            - Nice.

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.114
 - Oh, you think this is funny?

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:50.651
     - You should be happy.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.921
   We showed a lot of stamina
     and strength in there.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:55.122
            - True.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.824
 Couldn't do that a month ago.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:59.827
   - It's a testament to the
   quality of this facility.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.563
  I understand if you want us
 to be in a promotional video,

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:04.599
   and we accept your offer.

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:07.535
   If the price is right, of
            course.

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:09.704
  - And I'm gonna need my own
            trailer.

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:11.506
    - Two trailers for him.

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:14.108
The second one's for his massive
             balls.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:15.543
      Attacking a Marine?

01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:17.778
          - A Marine?

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.647
  You look more like a hippie.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:22.016
    Besides, you did kind of
  throw a medicine ball at me,

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.551
        so there's that.

01:15:24.254 --> 01:15:28.189
       - All good points.
 - Enough, Abbott and Costello.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.502
  Look, if this happens again,

01:15:29.503 --> 01:15:30.814
  I'll be forced to remove you
          guys from--

01:15:30.815 --> 01:15:32.126
    - You asked if I skipped
    lunch earlier in there.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:33.094
      I did, I'm starving.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.546
              You?

01:15:34.547 --> 01:15:35.997
         - I could eat.
 - We done here drill sergeant?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.515
             - Yes.

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:39.032
    You both are free to get
   the hell out of my office.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:46.607
  (people chattering quietly)
       (soft jazz music)

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.179
- I didn't hurt you earlier, did
               I?

01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:53.915
- Don't flatter yourself, Sally.

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:55.983
           All right.

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.552
        (Jon chuckling)

01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:00.021
    Maybe a little bit, but
   it's all good, no worries.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:03.891
 It's part of the reason I gave
  you so much shit this week.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.060
       - The only reason?

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.865
   - Because you can do this.

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:14.569
 I can see it in your eyes, but
             you--

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.903
       (fork clattering)

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.105
     - [Brian] It's, it's,
     it's fine, it's fine.

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:31.319
 - But you whine, and crumble,
  and you're better than that.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:33.788
Things are different for us now.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.991
  Mood swings, forgetfulness,
   strength coming and going,

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:38.359
 shot balance, all that stuff.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:40.695
     The only thing we can
     do to get ahead of it

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:43.631
 is if we, if we work our asses
              off.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:47.969
  - Will we ever be ourselves
             again?

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:52.873
     - We'll always be us.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.277
    We'll just be a new us.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:16:59.880
  - I kinda liked the old me.

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:01.315
           - Too bad.

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:05.052
   You think I wanted an IED
  bomb to explode in my face,

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.855
  kill my brothers and sisters
    in some desert shithole?

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.392
          - IED bomb?

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:14.862
      Wow, I had no idea.

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:19.700
      - So, what happened?

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:22.737
        - I don't know.

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:24.772
    I don't wanna tell you.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.107
        - [Jon] Why not?

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:31.779
 - It's, uh, it's embarrassing.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:40.021
     We think I was sucker
   punched outside of a bar.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:42.156
          - We think?

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:49.130
       Well, there's some
   cowardly people out there.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:50.665
      Got you and me both.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.135
    Don't be ashamed of what
        happened to you.

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:56.103
      Wear it with pride.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.309
        (birds chirping)

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.288
       - You hungry, Bri?

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:15.222
             - Mmm.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:19.894
      Therapy is draining.
     (Mary Beth chuckling)

01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:21.095
  - I heard you made a friend.

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:23.330
          - Hmm, Jon.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.232
   Got nailed by a car bomb.

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:26.901
     Now he's got the PTSD.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:28.969
         - Is he nice?

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:31.338
  - Mmm, he's sort of a dic...

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:33.941
             Tator.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:38.846
   Um, always bossing people
            around.

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:42.249
    - Feeling better, daddy?

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:44.952
     - A little bit, Karen.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.390
- Why did you just call me that?

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.903
      (Mary Beth sighing)

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:08.342
 - So, how long did the jagoff
   that did that to you get?

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:09.977
             Seven?

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.812
      I'm guessing seven.

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:13.380
         - Nothing yet.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.850
The court proceedings are taking
            forever.

01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:18.452
     - That animal is still
   out there walking around?

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:19.353
         - I guess so.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.223
  - How's Mary Beth feel about
             that?

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:24.158
       - She's mad at me.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.193
         - Mad at you?

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:29.764
 You're the one who got sucker
            punched.

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:32.967
    - Yeah, she's mad at me
    because I won't testify.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.836
      - You won't testify?

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:39.874
       Why the hell not?

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.210
  - They're gonna ask me about
          that night.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:45.212
   - [Jon] So the fuck what?

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:46.347
      - I don't remember.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.984
- You have to at least go, man.

01:19:51.087 --> 01:19:53.053
   He can't get away with it,
             Brian.

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:55.523
   - I'll look like an idiot.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:01.262
 - Well, all the therapy in the
  world ain't gonna help that.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:17.511
 - So I thought that movie was
          pretty good.

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:20.915
    I mean, the story wasn't
   great but the acting was,

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.917
          it was good.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.385
 What was that actress's name?

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:26.954
          - Which one?

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.157
          Kate Upton.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.091
           - Uh huh.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:35.029
 She was, she was pretty good.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:36.497
            - Mmhmm.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:40.167
 So um, don't we have to go get
  the kids from the sitter's?

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.036
   - I'll go grab 'em later.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:45.840
I thought that it would be nice
  to have a little alone time.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.314
     - [Brian] I love you.

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:54.949
       - I love you too.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:01.155
    (Brian's family talking
     and laughing quietly)

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:03.324
       - [All] Surprise!

01:21:03.326 --> 01:21:06.861
    (all talking excitedly)

01:21:12.068 --> 01:21:14.869
      - I love you, daddy!
             - I...

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.904
     - Honey, what's wrong?

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:18.439
   - I didn't see it coming.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.973
   - Hey, that's how surprise
         parties work.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:23.978
 - I should have saw it coming.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.879
     - No, no, no, no, no,
   don't get mad at yourself.

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:27.648
   Everybody can be surprised
      by a surprise party

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.083
  because nobody thinks their
             family

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:31.418
is gonna sink to such a level to
             do it.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.455
     You know what I mean?
         - That's true.

01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:38.459
 (upbeat acoustic guitar music)

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:45.499
    - I gotta tell you, the
   day they wheeled you out,

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.234
   I knew you were a fighter.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.186
 I knew you were gonna make it,

01:21:49.187 --> 01:21:51.137
   and I knew that you would
      see a day like this.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.606
         - Thanks, doc.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:55.276
   And thank you for coming,
     that was really cool.

01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:59.380
Can I, can I ask you a question?

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:03.517
 I have this thing on the crown
          of my head.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.586
I'm scared to death to touch it.

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.555
  - And you just don't want to
  touch the top of your head?

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:10.024
         - [Brian] No.

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:11.576
 - Well, my first thought would
               be

01:22:11.577 --> 01:22:13.127
  don't touch the top of your
          head, okay?

01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:14.261
         Listen to me.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:16.213
  I'm sure everything's fine,

01:22:16.214 --> 01:22:18.164
    but the injury was only
    a few months ago, okay?

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:21.402
    So it is common to have
  weird little things happen.

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:23.170
     That being said, let's
    schedule an appointment,

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.405
    we'll take a look at it.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:26.507
            - Daddy!

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:27.942
         - Hey, honey.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.176
     - Play a song for us!

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:30.544
      - Oh, not right now,
          Snugglehead.

01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.146
     I think everyone is--
        - Come on, dad!

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:33.314
 You're awesome on that guitar!

01:22:33.316 --> 01:22:35.049
      Everybody loves it!

01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:38.185
            - Sure.
        - Come on, dad!

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:40.654
            - Yeah.
      - Maybe a quick one.

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:43.657
          Thanks, Jim.
       - You're welcome.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:44.591
            - Okay.

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:49.163
    - Everyone be quiet, my
   daddy's gonna play a song.

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:54.735
   (guitar strings strumming)

01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:56.670
     - I haven't picked one
    of these up in a while.

01:22:56.672 --> 01:22:58.739
  I'm sure it's like riding a
          bike, right?

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:05.646
   (guitar strings strumming
         discordantly)

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:14.755
 (gentle acoustic guitar music)

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:21.762
      (all talking loudly)
        (dramatic music)

01:23:36.379 --> 01:23:39.113
         (gentle music)

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:47.755
          - Come here.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:55.562
     - You're so beautiful.

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:11.245
       (Brian shuddering)

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:26.827
        Maybe next time.

01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:31.465
  - I'm sorry if I rushed you,

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:34.133
   it just seemed like you've
   been doing so much better.

01:24:34.136 --> 01:24:35.069
           It's okay.

01:25:14.243 --> 01:25:15.342
   - [Steve] What's up, bro?

01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:16.243
         - [Brian] Hey.

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:19.446
           Thank you.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:29.890
- I talked with Leslie Clarkson
             today.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:32.226
         Remember her?

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:34.328
            - Nope.

01:25:36.265 --> 01:25:37.564
    - She's the prosecutor.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.235
            - Okay.

01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:45.239
  - You need to meet with her.

01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:46.507
         - No, I don't.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.309
           - Brian...

01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:55.315
Ricky Stubbs made you like this.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.254
   - I don't care about that
    stuff right now, Steve.

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:02.456
- You act like that doesn't even
            matter.

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:04.858
 Okay, he needs to be in a cell
           somewhere.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:09.630
 - Great, so what good is that
          gonna do me,

01:26:09.632 --> 01:26:10.831
    putting his ass in jail?

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.433
      Is it gonna help me

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:17.204
 remember what I ate for dinner
          last night?

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:18.772
Is it gonna help me do anything?

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:21.909
  I don't care about that shit
           right now.

01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:23.777
  All I care about is getting
            better.

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:25.779
 - He's a piece of shit, Brian.

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:28.315
    He needs to get what he
        deserves, okay?

01:26:28.317 --> 01:26:30.717
    And Clarkson is gonna do
 that, but she needs your help.

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:32.586
     - Steve, I don't care.

01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:35.255
  - Man, you are not thinking
      straight right now.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:40.561
 Okay, that's, that's why we're
   here, trying to help you.

01:26:41.564 --> 01:26:42.596
      - I'm not that bad.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.835
I'm better than I was yesterday.

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:50.270
        - You are, bro.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:53.740
       Look, mom and dad,

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:56.977
  I mean, they're gonna try to
   baby you through all this,

01:26:56.979 --> 01:26:58.712
     but I'm not going to.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.415
     I'm your brother, I'm
     the only one who knows

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:02.849
  what a thick head you have.

01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:07.254
I'm just trying to look out for
           you, man.

01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:28.008
          (rock music)

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.315
     - [Henry] Hey, Brian!

01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:37.985
     - Oh, good to see you.
        - Yeah, you too.

01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:41.488
- Hey Bri, it's so great to see
           you, man.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:43.023
 - [Brian] Yeah, you too buddy.

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:44.725
    - [Joe] That's for sure.

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:46.560
         - Hey, Brian!
           - Oh, hi!

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:48.996
         - How are you?

01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:50.664
     - Great, almost 100%.

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:51.765
      - That is so great.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:54.468
           Hey, Joe.

01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:56.186
             - Jen.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:57.903
     Okay, that's great, we
    better go get our shoes.

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:00.874
            - Okay.

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:01.775
- Well, if there's anything you
             need,

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:02.943
     you just let me know.

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:03.877
        - Okay, thanks.

01:28:12.488 --> 01:28:13.887
      - Did you see that?

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.456
    - Joe, I'm not looking,
    this isn't high school.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.626
     - It's starting to get
         uncomfortable.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.362
       You can tell she's
  undressing me with her eyes.

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:23.330
             - Who?

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:24.831
             - Jen.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.333
   She needs to get over it.

01:28:26.335 --> 01:28:27.301
     I'm just not into her.

01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:29.303
  I got all these other babes.

01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:40.614
        (Joe chuckling)
            - Yeah.

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:41.548
           You're up.

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:01.935
        (Brian shouting)

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:02.969
          - Oh, shit!

01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:05.539
         Motherfucker!

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:09.343
        No, get off me!

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:11.978
     Fucking floor is wet!

01:29:14.717 --> 01:29:15.716
 What kind of fucking joint is
             this?

01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:17.818
       Clean your floors!

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:20.954
  'Cause someone can get hurt.

01:29:36.004 --> 01:29:38.872
        (dramatic music)

01:29:49.852 --> 01:29:52.686
     - Hey man, we were all
     a little off tonight.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.523
You still did better than Henry.

01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:34.194
         (tense music)

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:42.035
    (Ricky speaking muffled)

01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:42.903
        (Brian gasping)

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:44.871
        (Brian mumbling)

01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:48.508
  - [Mary Beth] Are you okay,
         what's wrong?

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:51.011
         Are you okay?

01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:56.583
      - [Brian] I'm okay.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:02.622
- [Mary Beth] Just go to sleep,
             okay?

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.651
    - Yeah, as it turns out,

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:34.553
  I'm actually not so good at
   the whole shopping thing.

01:31:35.858 --> 01:31:39.526
 - Well, exactly, and this will
             help.

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:43.930
           - Ah, mmm.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:46.600
           Mmm, mmm.

01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:52.138
              Hmm.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.008
         Hmm, hmm, hmm.

01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:01.848
            - Mmhmm.

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:05.252
    You know, I don't think
   they sell go fuck yourself

01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:06.786
   at the supermarket, Brian.

01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:09.155
   - Well, maybe they should.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:11.791
             - Hmm.

01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:15.929
      You forgot charcoal.

01:32:18.934 --> 01:32:19.900
          - Gas grill.

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:21.835
          - And food.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:23.837
       - That's, no, I...

01:32:27.009 --> 01:32:27.941
            Damn it!

01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:30.710
        - It's a start.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.846
- What do you mean it's a start?

01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:35.248
   It's been several months.

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.182
           I mean...

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:38.818
  Just, I want to get better,

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.987
I want to at least feel normal.

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:45.292
- Okay, it's like losing weight.

01:32:46.562 --> 01:32:48.995
      Nobody notices their
   weight loss as it happens,

01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:51.197
       day by day, right?

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:55.835
  But as the months go by and
 the clothes don't fit as well,

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:59.172
  and-and people find the need
 to poke holes in their belts,

01:32:59.174 --> 01:33:04.244
  all right, but when they see
 pictures of their old selves,

01:33:04.713 --> 01:33:07.213
  they realize how tremendous
       their journey was.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:10.884
             - Hmm.

01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:14.054
          Okay, fine.

01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:16.856
        (timer beeping)

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.794
         Medal, please.

01:33:20.796 --> 01:33:23.330
         (gentle music)

01:33:25.867 --> 01:33:26.800
            - Okay.

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:53.053
  - Would you like to talk to
 me about what's bothering you?

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:10.470
            Okay...

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:34.961
 I can't do this anymore, Bri.

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.471
 I feel like I've been demoted.

01:35:44.473 --> 01:35:46.973
  Like I hardly matter to you
            anymore.

01:35:52.414 --> 01:35:54.414
   The kids and I are walking
    on eggshells around you

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:56.082
  so you don't just fire off.

01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:05.992
I'm sick of feeling invisible to
              you,

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:11.164
    and feeling like less of
    a woman because of that.

01:36:21.543 --> 01:36:26.412
 I have poured all of my energy
  into helping you get better.

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:27.447
       But what about me?

01:36:29.885 --> 01:36:31.117
       I have needs too.

01:36:36.057 --> 01:36:38.792
   I feel like I'm only half
    still in this marriage.

01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:44.998
         It's not fair.

01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:58.511
    Maybe you don't have any
    feelings for me anymore.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:36:59.445
         Maybe you do.

01:37:01.116 --> 01:37:02.048
        I wouldn't know.

01:37:09.424 --> 01:37:11.324
     But I know I still do.

01:37:16.198 --> 01:37:17.831
       I still love you.

01:37:36.952 --> 01:37:37.917
           - I know.

01:37:49.164 --> 01:37:51.998
    I see how you look at me
 when I walk through the door,

01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:58.037
desperately hoping to recognize
   the man that you married.

01:38:01.343 --> 01:38:02.408
        And the kids...

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.282
 Hoping they'll see the father
  that they used to play with.

01:38:13.555 --> 01:38:15.355
     I know how much you've
          sacrificed.

01:38:18.994 --> 01:38:19.959
       I love you, Mare.

01:38:21.897 --> 01:38:22.629
         I can feel it.

01:38:25.467 --> 01:38:27.200
 I just don't know how to love.

01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:31.104
        (dramatic music)

01:38:47.289 --> 01:38:50.356
      (Mary Beth moaning)

01:39:11.346 --> 01:39:14.580
     (Mary Beth chuckling)

01:39:21.089 --> 01:39:22.655
     - Good morning, lover.

01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:24.424
  - Good morning, good lover.

01:39:24.426 --> 01:39:25.358
              Mmm.

01:39:27.729 --> 01:39:30.463
         (both moaning)

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:35.168
           Hey, Mare?

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:37.103
    - [Mary Beth] Yeah, Bri?

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:39.037
 - Am I doing better than I was
           yesterday?

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.106
            - Um...

01:39:42.277 --> 01:39:45.712
     Yes, Bri, yes you are,
     Brian, so much better.

01:39:48.616 --> 01:39:49.549
              Hey!

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:53.203
            Thanks.

01:39:53.204 --> 01:39:54.387
   - You should have some of
    that, it's really good.

01:39:54.389 --> 01:39:55.254
         - I'm trying.

01:39:55.256 --> 01:39:56.289
      - Morning, rugrats!

01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:57.323
      - [Jim] Morning dad!

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:58.624
     - You look good, dad!

01:39:58.626 --> 01:40:01.494
 - Oh, thank you Katie, I feel
             great.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.096
 All right, see you guys later.

01:40:03.098 --> 01:40:04.130
          Bye, lover.

01:40:04.766 --> 01:40:06.299
             - Bye.

01:40:06.301 --> 01:40:09.035
         (gentle music)

01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:48.041
  - I ain't takin' any deals.

01:40:48.043 --> 01:40:50.143
   Why you all even offering
       me a deal anyways?

01:40:50.145 --> 01:40:51.677
    You ain't got a witness,

01:40:51.679 --> 01:40:53.813
  which means you ain't got a
             case.

01:40:53.815 --> 01:40:55.281
    You all ain't got shit.

01:40:55.283 --> 01:40:57.183
- [Miranda] Okay, Ricky, that's
            enough.

01:40:57.185 --> 01:40:59.302
   You want us to do our job,

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.420
  then be quiet and let us do
it, or you're out of this room.

01:41:01.423 --> 01:41:02.722
     - Ricky, we got this.

01:41:04.626 --> 01:41:08.227
   - The last thing I need on
  my record is another felony,

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:10.763
  not to mention five years of
           probation.

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:14.734
    - Although out of line,
     my client does present

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:16.335
 an interesting point, Leslie.

01:41:17.305 --> 01:41:19.238
You don't have any witnesses, do
              you?

01:41:20.742 --> 01:41:22.141
        Trey, anything?

01:41:24.112 --> 01:41:25.678
   - We have a case, Miranda.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.712
      Don't kid yourself.

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:29.148
      We just want to save
    the family more trouble

01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:30.583
 than they have to go through.

01:41:31.419 --> 01:41:35.288
   - Yeah, and uh, just to be
             clear,

01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:37.290
    this is a one-time deal.

01:41:37.292 --> 01:41:39.358
 It expires once you leave this
             room.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.160
  - What, is that supposed to
           scare us?

01:41:41.162 --> 01:41:44.263
   Come on Leslie, we're not
            novices.

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:48.334
 Look, either drop the charges,
   or we'll see you in court,

01:41:48.336 --> 01:41:50.503
and we both know that you don't
           want that.

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:02.849
      (Mary Beth sighing)

01:42:05.553 --> 01:42:07.720
  - Mom, why can't we go too?

01:42:07.722 --> 01:42:10.790
- Yeah, grandpa lets me help him
             drive.

01:42:10.792 --> 01:42:12.758
   I'll drive all the way to
           'Sconsin.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.360
      (Mary Beth laughing)

01:42:14.362 --> 01:42:16.762
     - I'll tell you what,
   maybe grandpa will let you

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:20.166
help him drive to the sitter's,
             okay?

01:42:20.168 --> 01:42:22.168
Get your stuff, it's almost time
             to go.

01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:30.776
         - Oh, hey Bri.

01:42:30.778 --> 01:42:32.678
 Did you, uh, have a change of
             heart?

01:42:33.581 --> 01:42:34.514
            - Nope.

01:42:34.516 --> 01:42:37.884
 - Ms. Clarkson said she would
  keep you on the witness list

01:42:37.886 --> 01:42:41.287
         in case you--
     - Mare, I'm not going.

01:42:42.157 --> 01:42:43.623
            I'm not.

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:48.528
    - Bri, for some reason,
     you don't give a damn,

01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:50.696
        okay, but we do.

01:42:50.698 --> 01:42:54.333
   We care about you, and we
  want to see you get justice

01:42:54.335 --> 01:42:56.869
for what this degenerate did to
              you.

01:42:56.871 --> 01:42:58.704
  I mean, he ruined your life,
             Brian!

01:42:58.706 --> 01:43:01.641
   - For fuck's sake, Steve,
    we've been through this.

01:43:01.643 --> 01:43:02.775
            - What?

01:43:02.777 --> 01:43:04.944
           - Brian--
       - No, dad, please.

01:43:06.548 --> 01:43:09.282
      I told you, I don't
    care about Ricky Stubbs,

01:43:09.284 --> 01:43:10.750
     and I don't care what
    happens to Ricky Stubbs.

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.217
   - Well, maybe you should!
        - Don't tell me

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.921
  what the fuck I should care
         about, Steve!

01:43:14.923 --> 01:43:15.855
             Don't!

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.927
       I barely remember
   anything from that night.

01:43:20.929 --> 01:43:24.397
    Shit, I barely remember
    anything from yesterday.

01:43:24.399 --> 01:43:26.566
Do you have any idea what that's
             like?

01:43:26.568 --> 01:43:29.735
    Waking up every morning,
   spending hours desperately

01:43:29.737 --> 01:43:33.639
    just trying to remember
  what you did the day before,

01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:36.509
     conversations you had,
     who you had 'em with.

01:43:41.416 --> 01:43:45.818
   All I do is pray and work

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.555
   and do everything I can to
  just find one little shred,

01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:51.924
 one little shred of the man I
          used to be.

01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:56.362
You think I care about justice?

01:43:57.265 --> 01:43:59.332
  There is no fucking justice.

01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:01.634
           - Brian--
         - He's right.

01:44:02.604 --> 01:44:03.769
          He's right.

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:04.837
        Leave him alone.

01:44:05.873 --> 01:44:08.474
 We need to respect his wishes.

01:44:08.476 --> 01:44:11.344
        (dramatic music)

01:44:27.462 --> 01:44:28.894
      - Hey, Snugglehead.

01:44:30.898 --> 01:44:34.300
     Look, I'm really sorry
    I got upset downstairs.

01:44:34.302 --> 01:44:38.871
 Just, your Uncle Steve can be
 pretty frustrating sometimes.

01:44:39.707 --> 01:44:40.640
          - It's okay.

01:44:44.712 --> 01:44:45.578
             Here.

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:46.445
Maybe you can hang out with him.

01:44:47.015 --> 01:44:49.382
 - [Mary Beth] Katie, honey, we
          have to go.

01:44:50.885 --> 01:44:51.917
      - Thank you, Katie.

01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:56.322
       I love you, honey.
       - I love you too.

01:45:00.428 --> 01:45:03.562
      (Jon humming softly)

01:45:06.067 --> 01:45:09.035

01:45:37.799 --> 01:45:39.065
   Who pissed in your grits?

01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:41.701
   - I don't even eat grits.

01:45:41.703 --> 01:45:43.369
          Just drive.

01:45:43.371 --> 01:45:45.071

01:46:14.351 --> 01:46:15.801
  - [Jerry] He probably didn't
want to get his ass beat again.

01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:17.136
   (Mick and Jerry laughing)

01:46:17.138 --> 01:46:18.971
    - No, stop, stop, stop.

01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:26.078
     The only coward is the
    one sitting right there.

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:30.116
     - [Bailiff] All rise.

01:46:40.695 --> 01:46:42.428
- You should have gone up there.

01:46:44.499 --> 01:46:45.765
     - Fuck, man, you too?

01:46:46.634 --> 01:46:47.733
    We've been through this.

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:49.034
    I don't remember enough.

01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:50.936
       - That's bullshit.

01:46:52.707 --> 01:46:53.639
        - I wish it was.

01:46:55.076 --> 01:46:57.109
  - I'm not saying you should
 lie, but at least go up there

01:46:57.111 --> 01:46:59.011
 and spit in the guy's mouth or
           something.

01:46:59.013 --> 01:47:01.030
        (Brian sighing)

01:47:01.031 --> 01:47:03.048
  - Jon, I just wanna move on.

01:47:04.152 --> 01:47:05.684
 I might be able to go back to
           work soon.

01:47:05.686 --> 01:47:08.687
 - Yeah, a nine to five sounds
             great.

01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:09.855
 - What's your fuckin' problem?

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:11.424
- [Jon] The only problem I have

01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:12.558
is I don't have a medicine ball

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.093
to throw at your face right now.

01:47:16.464 --> 01:47:17.563
- I don't need that shit today,
              Jon.

01:47:17.565 --> 01:47:18.898
  That's not why I came here.

01:47:19.734 --> 01:47:20.866
     - Why'd you come here?

01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:23.202
        - To get better.

01:47:23.204 --> 01:47:24.837
         - Yeah, yeah.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.907
   You wanna move on and get
            better.

01:47:27.909 --> 01:47:29.675
   The fastest way to move on

01:47:29.677 --> 01:47:32.511
is to see that justice is done.

01:47:32.513 --> 01:47:34.847
    It's good for you, it's
      good for your soul.

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:37.950
  - Like I said, if I could, I
             would.

01:47:40.154 --> 01:47:42.555
        - Unacceptable.

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:44.957
    - Goddamn it, why don't
      you just worry about

01:47:44.959 --> 01:47:46.058
   your own fuckin' problems?

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:46.926
            - Yeah.
            - Right?

01:47:46.928 --> 01:47:48.661
    - Yeah, run away, Sally.

01:47:48.663 --> 01:47:49.762
     You're great at that.

01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:52.164
      Take this with you.

01:47:53.601 --> 01:47:56.802
        (dramatic music)

01:47:56.804 --> 01:48:00.239
  - [Ricky] Well, you can take
         this with ya!

01:48:02.543 --> 01:48:03.876
      - Get your car keys.

01:48:03.878 --> 01:48:05.644
 - No, I'm busy getting better.

01:48:07.114 --> 01:48:08.247
        - Get your keys.

   - Dr. Winston, if a person
  were to suffer from damages

01:48:59.033 --> 01:49:04.169
     such as subdural brain
          hemorrhage,
   lacerations to the brain,

01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:07.239
     significant damage to
     the left frontal lobe,

01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:10.175
      as well as bleeding
    into the spinal column,

01:49:10.177 --> 01:49:12.044
   what sort of possible side
            effects

01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:14.680
   could one expect from such
           injuries?

01:49:14.682 --> 01:49:15.981
    - Objection, your honor.

01:49:15.983 --> 01:49:17.767
    This line of questioning

01:49:17.768 --> 01:49:19.552
  has nothing to do with this
             trial.

01:49:19.554 --> 01:49:20.920
 - Your honor, on the contrary,

01:49:20.922 --> 01:49:23.055
   Mr. Sweeney sustained such
            injuries

01:49:23.057 --> 01:49:26.191
due to Mr. Ricky Stubbs' actions
   on the night in question.

01:49:26.193 --> 01:49:28.827
   Now in order for the court
  to understand the full scope

01:49:28.829 --> 01:49:31.864
  of Mr. Stubbs' actions, it's
    important that they know

01:49:31.866 --> 01:49:34.633
  the repercussions of damages
    suffered by Mr. Sweeney

01:49:34.635 --> 01:49:35.935
      as a direct result.

01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:39.271
          - Overruled.

01:49:39.273 --> 01:49:42.241
 Dr. Winston, please answer the
           question.

01:49:42.243 --> 01:49:43.742
    - Thank you, your honor.

01:49:43.744 --> 01:49:45.294
  If a person were to come in

01:49:45.295 --> 01:49:46.845
   with the injuries that you
           described,

01:49:46.847 --> 01:49:49.748
 they would be diagnosed with a
 severe traumatic brain injury

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.117
   otherwise known as a TBI.

01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:55.220
In short, they would have issues
   with executive disfunction

01:49:55.222 --> 01:49:57.189
   and stroke-like symptoms.

01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:59.058
  In layman's terms, what that
             means

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.194
  is they would have problems
 with focusing, concentration,

01:50:02.196 --> 01:50:06.131
   memory, mood stability, as
    well as muscle weakness.

01:50:06.133 --> 01:50:09.201
    Survivors can also have
    problems with seizures,

01:50:09.203 --> 01:50:12.104
hydrocephalus, or be in a coma.

01:50:12.106 --> 01:50:15.341
   - Now, you said survivors.

01:50:15.343 --> 01:50:18.243
   Does that mean that person
  suffering from such injuries

01:50:18.245 --> 01:50:20.045
   could possibly face death?

01:50:20.047 --> 01:50:23.182
     - Absolutely, as well
    as permanent disability.

01:50:23.184 --> 01:50:27.186
 (gentle acoustic guitar music)

01:51:11.932 --> 01:51:14.667
    - Dr. Flemming, in your
    professional experience

01:51:14.669 --> 01:51:16.268
  and after reviewing all the
            material

01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:19.171
 presented to you by the state,
   can you say with certainty

01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.173
   what caused Mr. Sweeney's
           injuries?

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:22.207
             - No.

01:51:22.209 --> 01:51:25.044
  No, after reviewing the MRI,

01:51:25.046 --> 01:51:29.114
  I cannot say with any degree
   of certainty what or whom

01:51:29.116 --> 01:51:31.216
  might have caused the injury

01:51:31.218 --> 01:51:36.288
     to Mr. Sweeney's left
  frontal and temporal lobes.

01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:39.925
  - Well, is it possible that
 his injuries are the result of

01:51:39.927 --> 01:51:43.762
  being intoxicated and simply
losing his balance and falling?

01:51:44.365 --> 01:51:47.166
          - Certainly.

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.968
  Falling head-first onto any
 hard surface such as concrete,

01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:52.104
 or even the corner of a table

01:51:52.106 --> 01:51:54.873
   could lead to this type of
            injury.

01:51:54.875 --> 01:51:56.175
         (upbeat music)

01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:05.250
 - Your honor, the prosecution
     has failed to provide

01:52:05.252 --> 01:52:08.187
   a single, actual witness.

01:52:08.189 --> 01:52:09.888
  We appreciate the testimony

01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:11.890
  of Mr. Sweeney's family and
            friends,

01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:15.394
as well as the expert testimony
  of these esteemed physicians

01:52:15.396 --> 01:52:17.830
albeit in a hypothetical manner,

01:52:17.832 --> 01:52:21.734
     as none of this proves
    that my client did this.

01:52:21.736 --> 01:52:23.335
   At this time, we'd like to
            request

01:52:23.337 --> 01:52:24.737
  that this case be dismissed,

01:52:24.739 --> 01:52:26.872
    and all charges dropped
          immediately.

01:52:26.874 --> 01:52:30.175
       I mean, unless the
 prosecution is able to produce

01:52:30.177 --> 01:52:33.345
 a single witness that actually
           witnessed

01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:35.247
   this alleged assault by my
            client.

01:52:37.485 --> 01:52:39.384
   - [Judge Collins] Does the
 prosecution have any witnesses

01:52:39.386 --> 01:52:40.886
       they wish to call?

01:52:40.888 --> 01:52:43.789
        (dramatic music)

01:52:46.193 --> 01:52:48.393
        - What the hell?
         - What is it?

01:52:48.395 --> 01:52:50.329
    (all talking excitedly)
            - Order!

01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:51.964
      Order in the court!

01:52:51.966 --> 01:52:53.932
        (gavel pounding)
             Order!

01:52:53.934 --> 01:52:56.034
 - Your honor, the state would
          like to call

01:52:56.036 --> 01:52:58.904
Mr. Brian Sweeney to the stand.

01:52:58.906 --> 01:53:00.906
   He has always been on our
         witness list,

01:53:00.908 --> 01:53:03.909
  which was of course provided
  to Mr. Stubbs' defense team.

01:53:07.081 --> 01:53:09.014
- Okay Mr. Sweeney, please take
           the stand.

01:53:09.016 --> 01:53:10.816
         - Oh, come on!
         (men shouting)

01:53:10.818 --> 01:53:12.551
   (Brian's family clapping)
            - Order!

01:53:12.553 --> 01:53:14.052
         Order, order!
        (gavel pounding)

01:53:14.054 --> 01:53:15.988
    Order in this courtroom!

01:53:20.895 --> 01:53:23.428
    - Raise your right hand,
    left hand on the Bible.

01:53:24.331 --> 01:53:26.198
    Do you swear to tell the
    truth, the whole truth,

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.901
      and nothing but the
    truth, so help you God?

01:53:28.903 --> 01:53:29.835
            - I do.

01:53:36.377 --> 01:53:39.511
 - Mr. Sweeney, can you recall
           the events

01:53:39.513 --> 01:53:41.046
   of the night in question?

01:53:45.586 --> 01:53:49.388
    - I was a different man
     before this happened.

01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:51.990
          (soft music)

01:54:17.551 --> 01:54:19.518
 You might get what you deserve
             today.

01:54:20.321 --> 01:54:21.253
         You might not.

01:54:23.457 --> 01:54:24.990
  I really don't give a damn.

01:54:26.427 --> 01:54:29.261
You've taken enough from me and
           my family.

01:54:34.134 --> 01:54:37.035
   That all ends today when I
  walk out of this courtroom.

01:54:37.905 --> 01:54:39.037
      All I care about...

01:54:42.076 --> 01:54:43.976
Is being the man that my family

01:54:46.914 --> 01:54:48.247
    and my friends deserve.

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.886
           That's it.

01:54:58.158 --> 01:54:59.157
      - Thank you, Brian.

01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:03.128
  That'll be all, your honor.

01:55:04.031 --> 01:55:06.598

   - We have no questions for
