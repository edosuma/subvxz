02:54.774 --> 02:56.606
- Scarlet?
- Excuse me,

02:56.608 --> 02:58.858
I'm sorry to bother you
this late.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.945
I'm looking for my child.

03:00.947 --> 03:04.072
He wandered off, and I think
he's somewhere around the area.

03:04.074 --> 03:06.701
I'm sorry,
I just got home.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.535
Would you
mind helping me look?

03:08.537 --> 03:10.829
Nobody's answering their
doors and I'm afraid

03:10.831 --> 03:12.206
something will happen to him.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.583
I really can't, I'm
expecting someone any minute.

03:14.585 --> 03:18.671
I could really use
another set of eyes, please.

03:18.673 --> 03:20.005
I'm sure there
are other people home

03:20.007 --> 03:22.259
who could help you, I'm sorry.

03:23.093 --> 03:24.969
Can I at least
give you a picture of him,

03:24.971 --> 03:26.303
just in case?

03:26.305 --> 03:30.725
Sure, but I'm terrible
with faces, just slip it

03:30.727 --> 03:31.561
under the door.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.688
Isn't he beautiful?

03:35.690 --> 03:37.690
If you'd just keep an eye
out for him, I'd really

03:37.692 --> 03:40.817
- appreciate it.
- No problem, good luck.

04:21.402 --> 04:22.237
Hello?

04:23.196 --> 04:24.030
Hey.

04:25.364 --> 04:28.865
No, that's fine, that's
fine, I'm still setting up

04:28.867 --> 04:31.451
and hey, when you get
here, I have to show you

04:31.453 --> 04:33.162
this picture this woman gave me.

04:33.164 --> 04:36.040
She came looking for her kid.

04:36.042 --> 04:39.876
No, really, it's fine,
just hurry up.

04:39.878 --> 04:42.420
Okay, love you too, bye.

05:01.859 --> 05:04.860
- Hello?
- It's me again.

05:04.862 --> 05:07.532
- Any luck?
- Unfortunately no.

05:08.366 --> 05:10.493
- Can I ask a favor of you?
- What is it?

05:12.119 --> 05:13.994
Nobody else
is answering their doors,

05:13.996 --> 05:17.497
I was wondering if you have
a flashlight I could borrow.

05:17.499 --> 05:19.292
He'll know it's me
if he sees it.

05:19.294 --> 05:22.044
I'm sorry, I
don't think I have one.

05:22.046 --> 05:23.254
Please,
nobody else will help us.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.963
You really need to
ask someone else, I've told you

05:24.965 --> 05:26.131
I can't help you.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.215
He's only five
years old,

05:27.217 --> 05:30.054
he's my only child,
please, will you just look?

05:32.931 --> 05:33.932
I'll be right back.

05:38.563 --> 05:40.021
Rachel.

05:40.023 --> 05:41.062
Where are the others?

05:41.064 --> 05:42.733
Inside.

05:47.571 --> 05:51.114
This is really old,
I can't guarantee it'll work.

05:51.116 --> 05:52.410
Thank you so
much, sorry to bother you.

05:54.244 --> 05:55.244
Enjoy your dinner.

06:13.056 --> 06:15.097
Enjoy your dinner?

06:33.910 --> 06:36.410
Call Scarlet Jones?

06:43.335 --> 06:44.711
Hey, are you almost here?

06:47.172 --> 06:50.590
The woman came back again
and I just feel weird.

06:50.592 --> 06:52.302
She said something
kind of strange.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.890
Okay, just hurry up.

06:59.643 --> 07:01.102
Okay.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.143
Okay.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.667
I never left these open.

08:54.008 --> 08:56.424
Leave right now or I'm calling
the police.

08:56.426 --> 08:57.425
Please,
he needs help.

08:57.427 --> 09:00.136
Get away from my door.

09:00.138 --> 09:01.722
You can't leave
us out here.

09:01.724 --> 09:04.641
Can't you see he needs help,
please?

09:08.439 --> 09:09.607
Open the door.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.548
Did you take your
pill this morning?

12:24.093 --> 12:24.969
It's rosemary.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.186
I'm gonna have to stay the
night again.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.020
Again?

12:36.648 --> 12:37.815
Uh-huh.

12:39.234 --> 12:40.652
Deadline's tomorrow.

12:42.861 --> 12:44.655
It's the biggest project
of the quarter.

12:45.782 --> 12:49.326
Boss is asking the whole team
to burn the midnight oil.

13:14.226 --> 13:19.231
I told you not to take too
many of those fucking pills.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.525
I'm gonna be late now.

13:21.776 --> 13:23.361
Make sure you clean all this up.

18:33.838 --> 18:39.844
No, no, no, let me out,
let me out, let me out,

18:40.511 --> 18:41.471
let me out!

18:43.348 --> 18:48.353
Let me out,
no, please, let me out!

18:53.690 --> 18:55.609
Let me out, let me out!

19:35.899 --> 19:37.234
John, leave, no!

19:44.951 --> 19:45.785
What?

20:28.453 --> 20:29.287
Wait, no!

20:32.040 --> 20:33.039
No!

20:33.041 --> 20:33.875
Get out!

20:41.925 --> 20:43.967
Get out of there, go, go!

20:59.024 --> 20:59.859
Wait.

21:13.790 --> 21:14.624
No, stop!

21:40.733 --> 21:43.485
No, John.

23:55.284 --> 23:56.119
Oh look!

23:59.914 --> 24:02.915
It's a hag stone, a stone
with its middle missing?

24:02.917 --> 24:04.543
It's supposed to
bring good luck.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.877
We could use some good luck.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.004
If you look through it,

24:09.006 --> 24:10.880
you're supposed to
see other worlds.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.676
Oh yeah, you want
to try it out?

27:33.461 --> 27:34.295
Can I help you?

27:51.271 --> 27:52.480
How much for the book?

27:55.148 --> 27:58.695
I'm afraid this particular
book is not for sale.

28:02.282 --> 28:04.199
Then why is it here?

30:46.737 --> 30:48.071
You okay?

31:11.428 --> 31:13.055
You all right, Pam?

31:14.890 --> 31:15.725
Yeah.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.976
I'm all right.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.354
What happened?

31:21.356 --> 31:22.732
I thought you were choking.

31:24.024 --> 31:26.192
No.

31:26.194 --> 31:29.364
Mason, I have to tell
you this, my dream, I...

31:32.617 --> 31:35.912
I was down here
in the kitchen

31:37.163 --> 31:42.916
and the wind was blowing
really loudly so I looked

31:42.918 --> 31:47.881
out the window and the trees
were being ripped apart.

31:51.718 --> 31:58.392
The wind just got louder and
louder until it was painful.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.354
And then it just stopped.

32:04.398 --> 32:06.024
And it got dark.

32:08.319 --> 32:10.571
And then I felt
something near me.

32:12.322 --> 32:14.157
I couldn't see it though,
I could just...

32:16.327 --> 32:17.161
Feel it.

32:27.004 --> 32:30.340
That's a disturbing dream,
sweetheart.

32:37.264 --> 32:39.434
But it was just a dream, right?

32:41.101 --> 32:42.394
Come on, let's go back to bed.

33:09.964 --> 33:11.131
Pam?

33:12.215 --> 33:13.051
It's here.

33:14.551 --> 33:15.677
It knows we see it.

33:45.750 --> 33:46.831
What are you doing?

33:46.833 --> 33:50.211
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

33:50.213 --> 33:52.507
My necklace, my stone
necklace, where is it?

33:53.465 --> 33:55.465
I threw it away.

34:20.451 --> 34:23.788
Oh my God.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.596
What, Pamela, what am I
looking at?

34:40.596 --> 34:45.601
Just look at it.

35:00.949 --> 35:03.992
What happened to it, Mason?

35:03.994 --> 35:05.621
Mason, what did you do with it?

38:27.864 --> 38:30.868
Mason, Mason.

38:32.996 --> 38:35.999
Mason, Mason.

38:38.208 --> 38:39.042
Mason.

38:40.377 --> 38:41.211
Wake up.

38:46.049 --> 38:47.551
It's not following me anymore.

39:34.181 --> 39:37.933
You know the morning
when we were at the motel?

39:37.935 --> 39:40.187
You said that it's not
following you anymore?

39:44.192 --> 39:45.440
You know what, never mind.

39:45.442 --> 39:48.278
Just forget I said anything.

39:50.281 --> 39:51.366
The seeing hole.

39:53.159 --> 39:54.702
The seeing hole from the stone.

39:56.578 --> 39:57.996
That's what was following me.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.873
And I never said it was gone.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.919
Are you saying the stone is
still here?

40:04.962 --> 40:07.672
I threw it out, Pamela,
I threw it away.

40:07.674 --> 40:08.507
No.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.844
It's right here.

41:22.498 --> 41:24.956
Pamela, Pamela, are you okay?

41:24.958 --> 41:29.964
I can't see, I can't see,
I can't see anything.

41:35.427 --> 41:37.177
There seems to be nothing
wrong with her physically,

41:37.179 --> 41:39.639
Mason, but we'd like to
keep her for a day or two

41:39.641 --> 41:42.601
for psych observation,
is that okay with you?

42:45.581 --> 42:47.790
Sir, can I come in, please?

42:47.792 --> 42:49.833
What is it you want?

42:49.835 --> 42:50.669
We're closed.

42:51.712 --> 42:53.295
I need your help.

42:53.297 --> 42:56.008
Help regarding what?

43:10.815 --> 43:11.648
Hey.

43:13.317 --> 43:14.569
Hey, where are you going?

43:15.904 --> 43:17.485
I need your help.

43:33.795 --> 43:34.630
So.

43:36.007 --> 43:38.927
You've decided to return
what you've taken.

43:40.969 --> 43:42.513
Something happened to Pamela.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.140
I just thought that...

43:46.643 --> 43:48.811
And you thought what, exactly?

43:53.148 --> 43:55.358
I thought you would know
something about the book.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.650
Maybe it had something...

43:56.652 --> 43:58.946
Yes, it belongs to me.

44:00.281 --> 44:02.614
I didn't know she
had taken it.

44:02.616 --> 44:03.909
It's just a book.

44:04.911 --> 44:08.248
Any recipes or spells
in it are just for fun.

44:10.792 --> 44:11.625
You're a liar.

44:15.505 --> 44:17.128
Listen.

44:17.130 --> 44:19.967
Some strange things are happening
to my girlfriend, Pamela.

44:20.927 --> 44:22.969
I need your help.

44:22.971 --> 44:25.764
I've never believed in this
kind of thing before, but...

44:26.723 --> 44:28.306
I think I'm starting to.

44:28.308 --> 44:31.728
And between that weird book
and that creepy hag stone,

44:32.605 --> 44:34.898
she seems to think
things are following her.

44:35.984 --> 44:36.900
Hag stone.

44:38.277 --> 44:40.696
Yes, the stone.

44:41.864 --> 44:43.282
She's had it for a while now.

44:44.491 --> 44:46.201
Then she started
sleeping with it.

44:47.328 --> 44:48.869
Recently it started
to freak me out,

44:48.871 --> 44:51.621
but now she's going
berserk over it.

44:51.623 --> 44:54.209
Now she seems to think
something's following her.

44:55.085 --> 44:56.337
Can you tell me anything?

44:58.339 --> 45:00.672
Did you see this something?

45:00.674 --> 45:01.508
No.

45:03.719 --> 45:04.553
I mean...

45:05.888 --> 45:07.762
I don't know.

45:07.764 --> 45:09.766
I did feel something.

45:11.895 --> 45:12.770
Something cold.

45:28.411 --> 45:29.537
You should distance
yourself from her.

45:30.496 --> 45:31.454
What?

45:31.456 --> 45:33.416
You should distance
yourself from me.

45:34.542 --> 45:35.375
Leave.

45:36.627 --> 45:38.628
But Pamela...

45:41.924 --> 45:43.382
Now.

45:43.384 --> 45:44.217
What...

45:59.900 --> 46:02.485
Her optic nerves are
in perfect condition.

46:02.487 --> 46:05.445
I'm not going to refer
her to the optometrist,

46:05.447 --> 46:08.824
but I'm going to give you a
number to a psychotherapist.

46:08.826 --> 46:12.286
Pamela's issues are rooted
somewhere in her mind.

46:12.288 --> 46:14.496
Her affliction is real, Mason,

46:14.498 --> 46:16.375
even if it's not apparent to us.

46:21.797 --> 46:24.049
Why is she wearing those?

49:29.027 --> 49:29.860
Shit, Pam.

49:32.614 --> 49:34.115
You scared the hell out of me.

49:37.451 --> 49:38.578
Are you feeling any better?

49:40.371 --> 49:41.789
I can see now, Mason.

49:42.831 --> 49:44.290
What?

49:50.589 --> 49:51.924
I can see now.

50:02.101 --> 50:03.768
I can see everything.

50:09.317 --> 50:10.818
I'm scared, Mason.

50:13.737 --> 50:16.573
Nothing is solid anymore,
everything is

50:17.991 --> 50:20.619
opening up, like flowers.

50:23.413 --> 50:24.331
Mason, please.

50:26.083 --> 50:26.917
Help me.

50:42.516 --> 50:43.768
Help me, Mason.

53:56.460 --> 53:58.001
As you can see,
it's complete pandemonium

53:58.003 --> 54:00.212
and chaos in the streets.

54:00.214 --> 54:03.176
I thank you for allowing me to
be your...

54:05.219 --> 54:07.931
Your final newscaster here on...

54:09.766 --> 54:10.808
Channel four news.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.853
I trust that everyone
is with their loved ones

54:16.313 --> 54:18.980
or doing what they love or
making love.

54:18.982 --> 54:21.693
For me, it's even...

54:22.694 --> 54:23.528
Oh my God.

54:24.656 --> 54:25.822
It's happening.

54:50.389 --> 54:53.849
Apocalypse, yeah right.

54:53.851 --> 54:56.309
Why are people so asinine?

54:56.311 --> 54:59.188
I mean, this isn't the first
time we tried

54:59.190 --> 55:00.775
to predict the end of the world.

55:01.859 --> 55:05.194
I remember this whole Mayan
Calendar crap a few years ago.

55:05.196 --> 55:08.532
You know, it had everyone
turning into preppers.

55:09.741 --> 55:13.703
Well, I think it's just,
well, stupid,

55:13.705 --> 55:17.373
how so many people can put
so much thought into the end

55:17.375 --> 55:22.380
over the present and now,
here I am, 2015,

55:24.549 --> 55:27.800
January 1st, and...

55:27.802 --> 55:32.807
No end of the world, no
UFOs, solar flares, no comet

55:34.808 --> 55:37.311
and, uh, no return of Cthulhu.

55:38.478 --> 55:43.484
Nope, it's just me
and my cubicle

55:43.860 --> 55:45.778
and another shitty day.

56:25.692 --> 56:28.110
It's 6:30 AM in
our paradise we call

56:28.112 --> 56:31.780
East Prairie, and there isn't
a lot of surprises this week.

56:31.782 --> 56:33.949
We're going to have a lot
of highs in the upper 70s

56:33.951 --> 56:35.576
and things are going to...

56:37.788 --> 56:39.079
- I
- wonder if they noticed

56:39.081 --> 56:41.623
if I didn't show up today.

56:41.625 --> 56:44.418
Business is business as
usual, I like to always say.

56:44.420 --> 56:47.630
Everstone Medical has once
again surpassed X Quartech

56:47.632 --> 56:50.507
as the worlds most valuable
company after the release

56:50.509 --> 56:53.802
of their new medication,
absorvital, that has been proven

56:53.804 --> 56:57.139
to eradicate autism within
children and adults.

56:57.141 --> 57:00.144
Yes, and X Corp's
stock has been on the decline...

57:02.480 --> 57:03.688
What in the hell is that?

57:03.690 --> 57:05.313
Suggesting that
its fast growth phase,

57:05.315 --> 57:09.025
rare for a company of its
size, may be coming to an end.

57:09.027 --> 57:10.777
Speaking of coming
to an end,

57:10.779 --> 57:12.487
there has been speculation...

57:12.489 --> 57:15.449
Suggesting that
its fast growth phase,

57:15.451 --> 57:18.994
rare for a company of its
size, may be coming to an end.

57:18.996 --> 57:20.746
Speaking of coming
to an end,

57:20.748 --> 57:24.083
there has been speculation of
just that

57:24.085 --> 57:25.166
as it pertains to the world.

57:25.168 --> 57:27.460
We may have narrowly
escaped armageddon

57:27.462 --> 57:28.837
a little over two years ago

57:28.839 --> 57:31.257
from the supposed
Mayan prediction...

57:31.259 --> 57:32.844
I don't
remember having this box.

57:33.802 --> 57:35.304
God, I'm losing it today.

57:36.431 --> 57:38.889
Speculations have
gone on to say that a local

57:38.891 --> 57:42.143
conglomerate, ironically
made to save lives,

57:42.145 --> 57:45.520
may be the cause
of said apocalypse.

57:45.522 --> 57:48.232
Skepticism has run heavy
over this story

57:48.234 --> 57:49.900
since its announcement.

57:49.902 --> 57:52.360
We actually go live to
Morgan Middlebrook,

57:52.362 --> 57:55.114
our man on the street,
as he gives us a look

57:55.116 --> 57:57.824
on how the city has been
taking the news

57:57.826 --> 58:00.037
of possible imminent death.

58:09.630 --> 58:12.840
No, no, no.

58:12.842 --> 58:13.676
No.

58:14.969 --> 58:17.679
Oh, you're so gonna charge
me for this, I know it.

58:22.768 --> 58:25.393
Where the hell did that
come from?

58:25.395 --> 58:28.105
Another day of being alive
after the apocalypse scare.

58:28.107 --> 58:31.067
Yes, yet another
prediction has...

58:43.623 --> 58:46.331
Steps to
building self motivation,

58:46.333 --> 58:50.168
how to motivate yourself
written by Rob Fladry.

58:50.170 --> 58:52.922
You have no personality,
low self esteem,

58:52.924 --> 58:56.132
and have driven yourself
into a safe routine life.

58:56.134 --> 58:58.219
And if you want to excel,
you need to remember

58:58.221 --> 59:01.889
these three steps, have a cause,
be hungry

59:01.891 --> 59:04.266
and let go of the past.

59:04.268 --> 59:07.561
Step one, I can't think
of a more powerful source

59:07.563 --> 59:10.690
of motivation than a
cause that you care about.

59:10.692 --> 59:13.567
Such cause can inspire
you to give your best,

59:13.569 --> 59:15.362
even in the face of adversity.

59:16.531 --> 59:17.699
It can make you do the seeming...

59:19.032 --> 59:22.367
Watch where you're...

59:22.369 --> 59:23.246
Just going.

59:24.496 --> 59:27.375
Shut up,
Julian, shut up and walk away.

59:28.668 --> 59:33.673
Oh, God, she's beautiful, why
is she just staring at me?

59:42.306 --> 59:45.475
Aw, crap, not this guy,
every morning.

59:47.811 --> 59:50.061
No, I want to get
an email to...

59:50.063 --> 59:51.063
I wish
you'd get in the elevator

59:51.065 --> 59:55.067
with me, I wonder if he
senses the awkwardness

59:55.069 --> 59:58.031
of these elevator rides so
he fakes phone conversations.

01:00:01.659 --> 01:00:05.744
Yeah, sure, I'll just hit
a button that you normally

01:00:05.746 --> 01:00:10.373
can hit yourself, sure,
no, no, problem, no, no,

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:13.170
not at all, you're the boss.

01:00:14.172 --> 01:00:16.799
I'm just another slave
to your grindstone.

01:00:19.092 --> 01:00:20.094
I swear.

01:00:21.804 --> 01:00:23.679
Catch that Bucks
game yesterday?

01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:25.264
No.

01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:27.476
Dean, all right, yeah,
no, good job.

01:00:28.393 --> 01:00:29.478
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:01:22.781 --> 01:01:24.407
Everstone Medical
Supplies has been serving

01:01:24.409 --> 01:01:27.367
the great city of East
Prairie for almost 40 years,

01:01:27.369 --> 01:01:30.788
founded in 1975 by my
great friend and father,

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:32.456
Patrick Romero, he
helped make this company

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:33.873
what it is today.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:37.420
Basing its success on three
core beliefs, speedy deliveries,

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:40.172
building a personal
relationship with clients,

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:44.217
and keeping the highest
recovery rate in the country.

01:01:44.219 --> 01:01:45.969
Here at EMS, we don't
just save lives...

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.821
It's her.

01:02:04.781 --> 01:02:05.782
It's really her.

01:02:09.286 --> 01:02:10.495
I can't believe it, she's...

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:15.500
Did she even see me?

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.713
What is she doing here?

01:02:39.484 --> 01:02:41.319
She's still out there.

01:02:43.947 --> 01:02:47.822
What is she doing with that
teddy bear?

01:02:47.824 --> 01:02:48.949
What in the hell?

01:02:48.951 --> 01:02:50.492
Tonight we are live
on the streets

01:02:50.494 --> 01:02:51.994
where you can see people
are in celebration

01:02:51.996 --> 01:02:53.956
over another day of being alive.

01:02:57.543 --> 01:03:01.547
Yes, it is true, yet another
prediction has been debunked.

01:03:02.422 --> 01:03:05.259
People are excited,
Tom, people are excited.

01:03:07.719 --> 01:03:11.264
Yes, another prediction
has been debunked,

01:03:11.266 --> 01:03:13.849
giving us all another
reason to appreciate

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:15.851
the lives that we live,
now, let's see if we can't

01:03:15.853 --> 01:03:18.353
pull the people off the
street and get their opinion.

01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:21.398
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, how
do you feel about tonight?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.692
I feel excited
about tonight.

01:03:22.694 --> 01:03:23.692
That's enough.

01:03:48.386 --> 01:03:50.261

building self motivation.

01:04:57.956 --> 01:05:01.706
How to motivate yourself,
written by Rob Fladry.

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:06.795
Step two, being hungry, wanting
something is not enough.

01:05:06.797 --> 01:05:09.715
You must hunger for it.

01:05:09.717 --> 01:05:12.134
Having your desire won't take
you through the difficult

01:05:12.136 --> 01:05:14.512
times since you don't want
things badly...

01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:31.862
Morning, thanks for
calling Everstone Medical

01:05:31.864 --> 01:05:34.324
tech support, this is
Julian speaking.

01:05:35.659 --> 01:05:37.578

Can I have your first
and last name, please?

01:05:44.335 --> 01:05:45.835
Do you have a number I
can reach you in case

01:05:45.837 --> 01:05:47.005
we get disconnected?

01:05:48.922 --> 01:05:51.340
Is there a secondary number
I can reach you

01:05:51.342 --> 01:05:52.802
in case I can't
reach you there?

01:05:54.804 --> 01:05:56.014
How can I help you today?

01:05:58.725 --> 01:06:00.891
Good morning, thank you
for calling...

01:06:00.893 --> 01:06:02.058
- I
- don't know why I can't stop

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.773
thinking about her, there's
just something about her.

01:06:09.527 --> 01:06:12.155

01:06:17.826 --> 01:06:18.867

we change them...

01:07:52.255 --> 01:07:53.089
Hello?

01:08:04.266 --> 01:08:07.143
Hey, hey, I just saw
you turn out the light.

01:08:07.145 --> 01:08:07.978
Answer the door.

01:08:10.105 --> 01:08:11.315
What is she doing here?

01:08:16.486 --> 01:08:17.484
Hello?

01:08:17.487 --> 01:08:19.365
Oh, she's beautiful.

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:23.578
All right.

01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:26.747
I can do this.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:35.505
Oh, God, who am I kidding, I
can't do this, I can't do this.

01:08:38.008 --> 01:08:39.216
Who am I kidding?

01:08:39.218 --> 01:08:40.219
Who am I kidding?

01:08:41.761 --> 01:08:43.054
He's not gonna answer.

01:08:43.055 --> 01:08:45.014
Why do I have to be
so awkward all the time?

01:08:45.015 --> 01:08:48.478
I mean, lions,
they're not awkward.

01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:52.147
I was shocked too.

01:08:53.106 --> 01:08:55.734
Just to see someone.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:02.573
I know this sounds crazy,
I can't imagine

01:09:02.575 --> 01:09:04.160
what you must be going through.

01:09:07.496 --> 01:09:10.206
It's kinda nice to be not
be talking to the wind

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:12.710
or inanimate objects around me.

01:09:14.587 --> 01:09:16.214
I mean, you're here
and I'm here.

01:09:20.676 --> 01:09:23.719
I remember when I couldn't
even pass by people

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.223
just walking down the street.

01:09:26.307 --> 01:09:29.602
Painful memories
right now.

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:34.941
Walking hand in hand?

01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:42.738
I know you're in there, just
answer the door, dammit.

01:09:50.163 --> 01:09:52.000
Okay, I can do this.

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:55.544
Be a lion.

01:10:01.174 --> 01:10:03.592
News anchors
John Carlo Hernandez,

Morgan Middlebrook.

01:10:13.812 --> 01:10:16.565
Hey you, come here,
no, closer.

01:10:23.155 --> 01:10:27.743
All types of men, and I'm
just waiting for you to call.

01:10:28.785 --> 01:10:32.287
So I can show you just
how much I like you,

01:10:32.289 --> 01:10:33.957
how much I want you.

01:10:36.335 --> 01:10:41.132
At only 4.99 a minute, how
could you resist this, Julian?

01:10:42.717 --> 01:10:43.551
Julian?

01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:46.137
Julian?

01:10:47.804 --> 01:10:48.639
Julian?

01:10:52.435 --> 01:10:53.975
Julian?

01:10:53.977 --> 01:10:54.811
Julian.

01:10:56.813 --> 01:10:57.648
Julian!

01:10:58.857 --> 01:10:59.691
Julian!

01:11:01.819 --> 01:11:02.654
Julian!

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.114
Julian!

01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:08.075
Julian!

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:04.421
Steps to
building self motivation,

01:12:04.423 --> 01:12:05.881
how to motivate...

01:12:45.339 --> 01:12:46.546
Huh?

01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:48.676
This
is it, she's talking.

01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:53.095
And I'm talking.

01:12:53.097 --> 01:12:55.014
You stroll down the
street with this dumb look

01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:57.808
on your face, you come over
to this newspaper stand,

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:00.936
grab that newspaper and
go into this building.

01:13:00.938 --> 01:13:03.521
Oh, do
not mess this up, Julian,

01:13:03.523 --> 01:13:05.733
do not mess this up.

01:13:05.735 --> 01:13:07.734
- With the same dumb look.
- Yeah, but...

01:13:07.736 --> 01:13:09.569
What, are you stupid
or something?

01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.279
- No, I...
- What do you even do in there

01:13:11.281 --> 01:13:12.739
I'm just going to work.

01:13:12.741 --> 01:13:14.744
Work?

01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:18.248
Wait, work, what?

01:13:21.292 --> 01:13:22.207
I know
I'm supposed

01:13:22.209 --> 01:13:24.085
to be paying attention to her
right now,

01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:25.588
God, she's beautiful.

01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:27.547
She's so...

01:13:30.259 --> 01:13:32.426
Wait, what did she say?

01:13:32.428 --> 01:13:36.514
There is no more work,
there are no people.

01:13:36.516 --> 01:13:41.644
There is just you and me.

01:14:00.706 --> 01:14:05.294
I am standing here in
downtown with...

01:14:06.337 --> 01:14:08.714
One minute away from the
moment of destruction.

01:14:10.508 --> 01:14:12.507
As you can see, it's complete
pandemonium and chaos

01:14:12.509 --> 01:14:13.343
in the streets.

01:14:15.512 --> 01:14:18.515
I thank you for allowing
me to be your...

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.353
Your final newscaster,
here on...

01:14:25.022 --> 01:14:26.065
Channel four news.

01:14:27.859 --> 01:14:31.735
I trust that everyone
is with their loved ones

01:14:31.737 --> 01:14:34.615
or doing what they love or
making love.

01:14:37.368 --> 01:14:41.077
For me it's even...

01:14:41.079 --> 01:14:43.248
Oh my God, it's happening.

01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:56.367
Apocalypse, yeah right.
