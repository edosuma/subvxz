00:08.376 --> 00:12.378
 [wind blowing, birds chirping]

00:13.581 --> 00:15.381
       - [O.S.] I dunno,

00:15.382 --> 00:17.182
  he just seems to be working
    us a lot harder lately.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.151
      Like, practices are
     getting a lot rougher

00:19.153 --> 00:21.420
    and just, like, a lot of
 exercise and a lot of running.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.389
  You know how I love running.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.224
            I dunno.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.625
   Yeah, I heard there was a
    party going on tonight,

00:26.627 --> 00:28.761
    I dunno if I want to go.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.531
 I don't know if I want to sit
    around Robbie's basement

00:32.533 --> 00:35.434
    while you guys make out
      in the laundry room.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.771
   Which Mark, Mark Mendola?

00:38.773 --> 00:41.140
       It doesn't matter.
        I'm babysitting.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.108
          Yes, again.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.376
         I dunno maybe.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.778
        How late are you
     gonna be hanging out?

00:45.780 --> 00:47.646
         - Hi, sorry.
         - I gotta go.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.314
      - Do you know where
      the post office is?

00:49.316 --> 00:51.150
     - Uh, the post office?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.786
     Uh, I'm not real good
     with directions, uh...

00:53.788 --> 00:55.972
            Oh, hey.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.157
     Can you help this lady
    get to the post office?

00:58.159 --> 01:01.126
        - Are you Anna?
        - Uh... Yeah!

01:02.630 --> 01:06.298
    [struggling, screaming]

01:35.763 --> 01:37.429
      [light piano music]

03:04.919 --> 03:08.320
     [video games playing]

03:08.322 --> 03:11.623
       - [O.S.] Jacob can
      you come down here?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.264
  Your dad should be home any
   minute with a new sitter.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.834
     Get down here and help
     me with your brother.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.385
          - Bye, Mom!

03:44.692 --> 03:46.592
             - Hi.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.993
       You must be Anna.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.761
   - And you're Mr. Thompson?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.430
         - Yeah, yeah,
      call me Dan though.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.899
  - It's so nice to meet you.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.969
    - Yeah, Maggie has been
      a lot less reliable

03:56.971 --> 03:58.570
 since she got her braces off.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.340
         I dunno what's
      going on with that.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.943
     It's me and my wife's
      anniversary tonight,

04:04.945 --> 04:07.512
        so you're really
     saving our butts here.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.648
    - Aw, happy anniversary.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.317
          - Thank you.
           Thank you.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.588
So, the kids have had play dates
     with the Abbott girls.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.925
    Ashley and - what's the
    little quiet one's name?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.294
             Um...

04:22.963 --> 04:24.830
           I forget.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.698
       - I just call them
       Sleepy and Grumpy.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.402
 - [laughs] Sleepy and Grumpy,
          that's good.

04:30.404 --> 04:34.906
     Yeah, well, our kids,
they tend to be more energetic.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.676
       They're good kids,
          great kids.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.745
      They're just...woo!

04:39.747 --> 04:41.980
       And then there's--
    then there's our oldest.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.583
            He's 11,
 he just started middle school

04:44.585 --> 04:48.687
      and you know, and...
      stones are dropping.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.455
     You know what I mean?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.691
  - That's okay, I can handle
        an 11 year old.

04:52.693 --> 04:57.029
  - Yeah, Maggie said you were
    quite the child herder.

04:57.031 --> 05:01.500
    You got a Facebook page
        and everything.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.871
    - Did you see my page?
    - No, no. I don't um...

05:05.873 --> 05:08.707
  I barely go on the computer.

05:08.709 --> 05:12.010
Yeah, I don't have one of those.
It's a little too much sharing.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.713
      But Joyce might've.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.754
         - And what age
       are the other two?

05:22.756 --> 05:26.925
   - Uh, Sally just turned 9,
   she just had her birthday.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.862
     And Christopher is 4.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.732
            He's a--
    He's a cute little guy.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.401
       He won't give you
       much of a problem.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.470
      - They're good ages.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.539
           [yelling]

05:41.408 --> 05:44.409
  - Give it back, Christopher!
  - Boys, slow it down.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.479
      [yelling continues]

05:48.382 --> 05:50.782
           - Mama?
           - Mm-hmm.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.484
- Is the new babysitter a girl?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.052
      - Yes, she's a girl.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.022
  - Because I like it when I'm
 not the only one all the time.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.057
     - You can't catch me!
     - Guys!

05:59.059 --> 06:02.928
    [yelling, rough housing]

06:04.365 --> 06:05.897
    - You guys. No, no, no.
          No jumping.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.566
            Come on,
      keep it downstairs.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.868
          Jacob! Hey!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.803
             [thud]

06:11.805 --> 06:12.738
             Jacob!

06:12.740 --> 06:13.939
       - I'm okay, Mommy.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.908
        - Little idiot!
        - Jacob.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.810
        - You know what?

06:18.812 --> 06:19.811
            - What?

06:19.813 --> 06:22.514
        - Hand it over.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.083
             Jacob!

06:25.085 --> 06:27.452
   - Hand it over!
   - He won't leave me alone!

06:27.454 --> 06:29.454
 The kid won't leave me alone,
       it's not my fault.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.790
      - Give me the game.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.992
       Till the weekend.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.093
          - For what?!

06:35.095 --> 06:37.396
         - I can't keep
      doing this with you.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.997
      You want me to keep
     paying for babysitters

06:38.999 --> 06:39.998
    till you're in college?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.434
             - Yes.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.403
       - Like it or not,
    you're the big brother,

06:44.405 --> 06:46.705
    and I need you step up.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.841
  You're not a little anymore.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.043
      - Jakey's gotta take
          care of us.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.578
      - Shut it, meat bag.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.847
             - Hey!

06:56.483 --> 07:00.852
  - [two-way radio] Hey Jake.

            Pick up!

07:02.022 --> 07:04.122
      - Hey. yeah. Howie.
       What do you want?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.591
     - Wanna come watch me
    play the new Dark Realm?

07:06.593 --> 07:10.095
     - Uh, no, no, I can't.
    Getting babysat tonight.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.497
            - Ooh...
     Maggie's coming over?

07:12.499 --> 07:15.667
      She so fine now she
      got her braces off.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.903
     - Uh, no, not Maggie.
          Someone new.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.439
        Her best friend
         or something.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.574
     - My mom lets me watch
     my sister after school

07:22.576 --> 07:23.842
  till she gets home from work

07:23.844 --> 07:25.677
          and I'm born
    three months after you.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.978
        - Good for you.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.581
   - Hey, so, remember how my
    cousins went on vacation

07:29.583 --> 07:30.716
           to Nevada?

07:30.717 --> 07:31.850
      Well they brought me
         back something

07:31.852 --> 07:34.119
  that's gonna blow your hole.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.153
         - What is it?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.456
       - I stashed it in
        your tree house.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.224
  Meet me there after bedtime.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.526
           - Alright.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.594
      I'll think about it.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.697
        - Over and out.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.765
          [door opens]
             - Hon?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.169

             Okay.

        - Hi, I'm Joyce.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.676
             - Hi.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.210
   It's so nice to meet you.
    Your house is beautiful.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.813
   - Sorry it's kinda a mess.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.549
     - I'll be right down.
     - Okay.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.955
- Can I get a hug before we go?
- Daddy!

08:09.957 --> 08:13.992
- Miss you.
- Thank you. I'll miss you, too.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.894
    - You smell funny, Dad.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.630
        - It's cologne.
    Your mom got it for me.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.031
       - What's cologne?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.933
      - It's like perfume
      for daddies.
      - Yeah.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.535
         - Okay, guys.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.136
    This is Anna, she's your
    babysitter for tonight.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.906
            - Anna!
            - Hi.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.742
     - I'm Sally.
     - And I'm Christopher!

08:30.744 --> 08:32.010
- That's my brother Christopher.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.044
      - Hey, Christopher.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.212
      - Beep, beep, beep.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.650
     - Oh, who's that guy?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.052
      - That's Glow Nose.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.587
          - Glow nose.
             Okay.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.855
         - He was my--
         - He was my--

08:43.857 --> 08:45.807
      - No, he was Jake's,

08:45.808 --> 08:47.758
   when he was a little kid,
    and then he was Sally's,

08:47.761 --> 08:49.194
       and now he's mine.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.896
      - He looks like he's
       had a lot of love.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.064
        - Yes, he does.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.668
    [footsteps approaching]

09:02.209 --> 09:04.309
  - Chris and Sal are babies.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.245
     I don't need her here.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.948
       - You know, this a
      really special night

09:09.950 --> 09:12.684
      for your mom and me.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.220
 - When are you gonna be back?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.655
      - [O.S] Jake's gonna
        be in trou-ble.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.823
       Ha-ha, ha, ha-ha!

09:18.825 --> 09:21.326
      - You'll be asleep.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.568
     [O.S.] Get downstairs
    and meet the new sitter.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.404
   - They already ate dinner

09:32.405 --> 09:33.905
     but if they get hungry
     they can have a snack.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.042
   There's cookies, crackers,
  gummies are in the cupboard.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.244
      There should be some
  baby carrots in the crisper.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.979
       Yes, there are...

09:40.981 --> 09:43.982
    -I left the number
    for the restaurant--
    - I have a pet hamster.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.350
        - And the number
       for my cell phone.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.985
 - His name's Admiral Wubbles.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.654
            - Yeah?
  You'll have to introduce me.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.289
        Do the kids have
       their own phones?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.991
       - "No cell phones
       till high school."

09:52.993 --> 09:54.960
  - That's right, family rule.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.662
 But feel free to call my cell
  anytime, with any questions.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.830
            - Okay.

09:58.831 --> 09:59.997
      - He's coming down.
      - Daddy!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.366
        - What else does
       she need to know?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.602
        - Ah, let's see.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.237
       They will probably
      try to convince you

10:06.239 --> 10:08.039
        to let them play
         in the garage.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.374
        Do not let them.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.677
    - What's in the garage?

10:11.678 --> 10:13.979
   - A '73 Corvette Stingray
 coupe that I restored myself.

10:13.981 --> 10:14.846
             So...

10:14.848 --> 10:16.915
            - Nice.
            - Yeah.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.983
     - Yeah, I had it bored
     and stroked to a 383.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.385
         Got about 400
      horsepower in that--

10:20.387 --> 10:22.754
 - I thought we were in a rush?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.623
      - Yeah, yeah we are.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.660
 And we're taking the minivan.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.262
 - So, bedtime is nine o'clock.

10:31.264 --> 10:35.000
  Jacob can stay up till 9:30
       but only to read.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.101
  They so should go down easy

10:36.103 --> 10:37.869
         because we had
     soccer practice today.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.839
      This one had ballet.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.074
 - Any allergies or medications
      I should know about?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.843
            - Ah...
     No, nothing like that.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.244
      - Nope, good genes.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.880
      - You have to watch
  Christopher brush his teeth.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.016
       Otherwise he just
      eats the toothpaste.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.051
             - Ah.
          There he is.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.419
   This is Jake, our oldest.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.955
      Jake, this is Anna,
        the new sitter.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.691
          - Hi, Jake.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.027
          - Say hello.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.294
             - Hey.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.230
  - A wealth of conversation.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.432
     He's mad at me because
       I took away his -

11:07.434 --> 11:09.701
       what is it called,
      hand-held DX thing.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.203
             - Oh.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.704
 - Okay, where is my good coat?
 Is it upstairs or where is it?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.239
    - Right in front of you.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.274
 - Alright kids, gather around.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.877
      Where's Christopher?
          Christopher!

11:18.879 --> 11:20.845
    - It's your anniversary!

11:20.847 --> 11:22.313
        - Say goodnight.
        - Goodnight.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.448
        - Nighty night!

11:23.450 --> 11:25.450
           - Alright,
      listen up you three:

11:25.452 --> 11:28.453
    Anna here is in charge,
             okay?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.722
          You be good
     and do what she says.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.389
            Capiche?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.824
          - Ka-peach.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.060
      Ka-peach, ka-peach,
           ka-peach!

11:35.062 --> 11:36.161
      - Good night, guys.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.462
         - Good night.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.764
       - Home by eleven.
            - Yeah.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.065
       - Enjoy your meal.
       Happy anniversary!

11:40.067 --> 11:41.332
          - Thank you.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.234
    - Bye guys, I love you!
    - Love you.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.236
    - [O.S.] Love you, too!

11:46.139 --> 11:48.473
     - What shall we play?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.477
     - Do you want to draw?
     - No.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.778
   - What do you want to do?

11:53.780 --> 11:56.848
   We could play board games?

11:57.484 --> 12:00.251
        [engine starts]

12:01.755 --> 12:03.221
      We could do make-up.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.356
             - No!
           I'm a boy!

12:05.358 --> 12:07.892
    - Can we get ice cream?

12:07.894 --> 12:13.498
             Um...
    Oh, let's play dress-up!

12:13.500 --> 12:18.937
   Yes, let's play dress-up!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.778
      - You coming, Jacob?

12:26.780 --> 12:27.879
        - Don't bother.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.882
       Jacob never plays
        with us anymore.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.890
 - Dress-up's for girls, Chris.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.892
       - Okay, what dress
         should I wear?

12:40.894 --> 12:43.294
     - This one, this one,
     or this one?
     - That one!

12:43.296 --> 12:45.530
          - Which?
          - This one.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.098
       - Right?
       - That's awesome!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.968
  - That's the best darn dress
        that I ever saw!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.836
 - And then she becomes queen.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.839
 And so then they can't decide
  who's gonna be queen again--

12:54.841 --> 12:58.076
 - So why don't they play 'rock
  paper scissors says shoot?'

12:58.078 --> 13:00.245
      - They can't play
      rock paper scissors.
      - Oh yeah.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.813
   - And so then they decide

13:01.815 --> 13:03.782
       that they're both
      gonna rule together.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.017
          - Hey guys.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.854
  What if I told you that you
    don't have to be a boy,

13:09.856 --> 13:14.392
     or a girl, or a human,
      or really anything?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.995
           You can be
      whatever you wanted.

13:16.997 --> 13:22.133
     And all you had to do
          was pretend.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.871
   Because Pretending is this
    super power we all have.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.540
        When we pretend,

13:28.542 --> 13:32.143
        we can be anyone
         we want to be.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.280
         And if you get
       really good at it,

13:35.282 --> 13:37.549
     people won't even know
   you're pretending anymore.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.417
    - I wanna play pretend!

13:39.419 --> 13:41.186
            - Okay.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.601
       [distant yelling]
    [footsteps approaching]

14:05.312 --> 14:08.213
           Cool room.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.984
        - It's alright.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.230
        - Lemur-boy, huh?

14:25.465 --> 14:28.032
   You ever read Death Vice?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.802
             - No.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.970
        Mom and Dad say
       it's too violent.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.441
      - Well, your parents
     aren't here right now,

14:36.443 --> 14:39.143
           are they?

14:52.158 --> 14:54.893
         See ya later?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.932
      - I never feel great
   leaving them with someone

15:00.934 --> 15:03.501
         we don't know.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.637
    - I thought Anna seemed
     like a very nice girl.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.673
       - Yeah, I noticed.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.248
      - The kids are gonna
         be fine, okay?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.450
   Jan Abbott said that Anna
    is great with her girls

15:19.452 --> 15:23.321
     and we both know that
      they're nightmares.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.089
      Tonight's about us.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.226
        Thirteen years.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.030
  Our marriage is a teenager.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.500
I think we deserve a night off.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.670
           - I agree.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.539
          - New dress?
          - Yes.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.574
       - Now you notice.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.010
     - I, I noticed before.

15:46.012 --> 15:52.216
  It just took a little while
  for the polaroid to develop.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.585
          - Thank you.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.960
   - I am Princess Petalsong.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.029
     My leaves are vibrant,
       my fruit is tart,

16:05.031 --> 16:06.731
     and my roots run deep.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
  She's from Enchanted Forest.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.101
         On Toon Tube?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.502
    Mommy bought it for me.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.204
     It's my favorite show.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.007
            - Rarr!

16:16.009 --> 16:18.509
             - Wow,
    what a big scary Bronto!

16:18.511 --> 16:20.611
       Look how the floor
     shakes when he moves.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.013
       - What the heck?!

16:22.015 --> 16:23.481
       Were those Mommy's
         good pillows?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.718
            - Rarr!

16:26.720 --> 16:28.686
  - What'd you stuff it with?

16:28.688 --> 16:30.254
         - Sweatshirts.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.290
   - Now this is Pretending.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.994
     Not some out-of-a-bag
  get-up your mom bought you.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.464
      - He ruined Mommy's
         good pillows!

16:39.466 --> 16:44.035
    - Sometimes it's okay to
    destroy things for fun.

16:44.037 --> 16:47.438
    Good job, Christosaurus.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.609
            - Jacob!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.545
      Daddy's old uniform!

16:54.547 --> 16:56.781
       - Jacob's gonna do
        pretend with us!

16:56.783 --> 16:58.449
       - Leave me alone.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.018
        - Just get offa.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.121
   - Anna, we're not allowed
    to play with this stuff.

17:03.123 --> 17:09.227
    - Well Sal, Mom and Dad
     aren't here, are they?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.199
        - That's right.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.335
           - No fair.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.469
    - Hey, you were supposed
        to be pretending

17:18.471 --> 17:21.204
     to be something, too!

17:21.207 --> 17:23.441
        - I already am.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.644
        - Whatdya mean?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.549
     - I'm a photographer!

17:31.551 --> 17:37.355
Yeah, I travel around the world
         taking photos
     of amazing creatures.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.424
        Hey Christopher,
     what do dinosaurs do?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.692
    - Sit down and eat meat!

17:41.694 --> 17:44.495
   - [chuckles] That's right.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.198
             Smile.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.369
   Alright, give us a twirl,
           Princess.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.240
           Beautiful.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.708
           Stand up.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.645
       Come on, big boy.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.250
    Alright stand together.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.418
       Raise that trophy
        over your head.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.087
But not like you're victorious,

18:09.089 --> 18:12.190
      like you're going to
    smash it on top of her.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.860
      Sally, stop smiling.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.531
         Stop smiling.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.667
             Good.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.635
        [ominous music]

18:24.637 --> 18:27.305
               ¶¶

18:29.476 --> 18:31.676
        [camera clicks]

19:16.256 --> 19:17.822
       - Did you do this?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.690
      - Yeah, I did that.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.692
      - When did you have
        time to do that?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.928
      - I had enough time
       on my lunch break

19:23.930 --> 19:27.198
        to run them here
         from Vinnie's.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.167
       - Vinnie!
       - Remember Vinnie?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.735
           - Vinnie.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.302
        - Vinnie was 75
     when we first met him.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.771
        - How old is he?
        - Vinnie was 75.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.439
      - So he's a 104 now.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.308
           [laughing]

19:37.310 --> 19:38.643
    - Remember what he said?

19:38.645 --> 19:39.544
       - I don't remember
         what he said.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.579
   - "Red is for the passion.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.882
  White is for the longevity."

19:44.884 --> 19:47.318
        - That's right.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.287
         - We got that.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.700
      - We got them both.

19:50.701 --> 19:52.112
    - [O.S.] I don't want to
       play this anymore.

19:52.113 --> 19:53.524
      - Yeah, let's play a
        different game.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.759
           - Alright.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.061
     How about Hide & Seek?
            Not it!

19:57.063 --> 19:58.329
           - Not it!
           - Not it!

19:58.331 --> 19:59.397
          - Jake's it!

19:59.399 --> 20:02.967
             - No.
    No, no, I'm not playing.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.203
   I'm not-- I'm not playing.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.337
     I don't want to play.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.306
      - Oh, come on, Jake.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.841
   Don't you want to find me?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.220
        - One hundred...

20:22.222 --> 20:23.521
         ninety-nine...

20:23.523 --> 20:25.456
        Ninety-eight...

20:25.458 --> 20:27.858
        ninety-seven...

20:28.494 --> 20:30.962

         and I know it.

47:47.165 --> 47:50.333

        to hear one word

49:45.350 --> 49:47.183
      about all the games
      we've been playing.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.218
    Okay, now I've been nice
      to you guys so far--

49:49.220 --> 49:51.320
       - You haven't been
          nice at all.

49:52.991 --> 49:57.093
     - That is what happens
      when you misbehave.

49:58.463 --> 50:01.130
  Now I want you to stay here
and be quiet until I come back,

50:01.132 --> 50:03.566

        [doorbell rings]

50:44.475 --> 50:46.675
         - Who are you?

50:47.545 --> 50:49.578
     - I'm the babysitter.

      - Um, no you're not.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.750
       - Of course I am.
          Who are you?

50:54.752 --> 50:56.752
         - I'm Maggie.

50:56.754 --> 50:59.455
           You know,
  the Thompson's usual sitter?

50:59.457 --> 51:01.557
     See, I was supposed to
     watch the kids tonight

51:01.559 --> 51:03.592
    but this guy I know that
     goes to college asked

51:03.594 --> 51:04.819
    if I wanted to hang out

51:04.820 --> 51:06.045
      and I've been really
  wanting to hang out with him

51:06.046 --> 51:07.271
  so I couldn't say no, right.

51:07.272 --> 51:08.497
 So I called my friend Anna to
see if she could babysit for me

51:08.499 --> 51:09.849
     and she said she would

51:09.850 --> 51:11.200
    and I've been texting to
    see how it's been going

51:11.202 --> 51:12.802
     but Anna hasn't gotten
   back to me which is weird

51:12.804 --> 51:14.303
  because she's like the most
  promptest text backer ever--

51:14.305 --> 51:16.138
         - It's Maggie!

51:16.140 --> 51:17.373
          - Maggie...

51:17.375 --> 51:18.508
     - [O.S.] and the last
        thing she posted

51:18.509 --> 51:19.642
  was that she was coming here

51:19.644 --> 51:21.243
       and since then she
     hasn't posted anything

51:21.245 --> 51:22.711
   so I just thought I'd like
     come by on my way back

51:22.713 --> 51:24.563
 to make sure everything's okay
         but then like,

51:24.564 --> 51:26.414
   you're here and she's not
      and I'm kinda like,

51:26.417 --> 51:29.485
        WTF is going on.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.123
    - [O.S.] Right, Maggie.

51:34.125 --> 51:39.361
       Yeah, so you're a
        friend of Anna?

51:39.363 --> 51:40.429
      Yeah. She got sick.
        Food poisoning.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.633
 And the Thompson's called me.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.403
    They're a family friend.

   Well, do you think I could
   just say hi for a second?

        - [O.S.] No! No.

         You know what,
        they're asleep.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.178

  I won't tell Dan and Joyce,
           I promise.

51:57.448 --> 51:58.747
             - No.

         You know what?
          Stay there.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.517

      And you like Maggie.

52:33.618 --> 52:36.152
       You wouldn't want
 anything bad to happen to her,
