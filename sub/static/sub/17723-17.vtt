00:18.218 --> 00:19.385
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:24.056
(slurring): Wow! That same
guy just dunked it again.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.292
That's an
instant replay, Dad.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.628
Still.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.397
(laughs):
Okay, okay.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.398
Cheers.
Good night, Dad.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.400
Yeah, good night.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.035
<i>What?</i> Oh, come on.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.370
Let's kill this bottle.
You know,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.172
when we bought
this bottle today,
didn't we agree

00:40.174 --> 00:42.941
that it was gonna be
a two-month supply?
Uh-huh.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.713
Whoa! Those two
months flew by, huh?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.081
Whoa!

00:49.083 --> 00:51.316
WARNER (chuckles):
Okay.
Well...

00:51.318 --> 00:54.520
I guess I'll go to bed.
Yeah.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.588
Right? Whoa.
(chuckles)

00:59.159 --> 01:01.393
Ship it in the sand dome.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.730
And...

01:04.732 --> 01:07.733
and ish... banny banny...

01:07.735 --> 01:10.169
gunda to form it.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.108
How does your dad not Janis
Joplin choke-puke himself

01:16.110 --> 01:18.277
to death every night?

01:22.949 --> 01:25.117
Bazza Ronin, Dad.

01:28.455 --> 01:31.190
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.096
(screaming)

01:37.098 --> 01:39.098
What happened?! Oy!

01:39.100 --> 01:42.568
Was the raccoon masturbating
at the window again?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.303
No. Your dad

01:44.305 --> 01:47.306
peed on our couch!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.109
What?

01:50.111 --> 01:52.544
He must have gotten up in
the middle of the night,

01:52.546 --> 01:55.147
still drunk, and thought
this was the toilet.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.448
(quietly):
God.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.951
Ew!

01:58.953 --> 02:01.220
Hey, Bloody
Mary, anyone?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.288
No. No more drinking.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.590
No more drinking in this house.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.159
Oh, come on, Camila! Please!
Nope. Nope.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.760
If you want
to continue to drink,

02:08.762 --> 02:10.329
you will not be living
in our home.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.763
Okay, got it.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.166
I'll just keep it
at the white meats,

02:14.168 --> 02:16.135
vodka and gin.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.736
Wha...? No.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.505
Beer and wine. Got it.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.906
No.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.141
Wine coolers and...

02:22.143 --> 02:24.910
uh, cooking sherry. Done.
It's easy.

02:24.912 --> 02:25.744
No.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.279
Vanilla extract and...

02:27.281 --> 02:29.348
and turpentine!
No, Crawford, nothing!

02:29.350 --> 02:31.150
You know what?
As a show of solidarity,

02:31.152 --> 02:33.152
Warner and I are gonna
quit drinking, too.
Yeah.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.920
(laughing)

02:34.922 --> 02:36.321
What? No, no...

02:36.323 --> 02:39.691
no, no, no, <i>no.</i>

02:39.693 --> 02:41.593
Okay, well, if Crawford stops,
we all stop.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.262
It's only fair.
Okay, honey,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.330
in all honesty,
if I want to have a drink,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.498
there's nothing you
can do about it, so...

02:46.500 --> 02:47.499
(chuckles)

02:47.501 --> 02:51.503
Oh! Oh! Aah! The pee
couch, the pee couch!

02:51.505 --> 02:53.005
The pee couch.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.642
I can't believe you took
a called third strike

02:56.644 --> 02:59.211
in a slow-pitch
softball game.

03:02.649 --> 03:06.185
She <i>was</i> one
of their better pitchers.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.887
She was in a wheelchair.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.159
You know why I stink
so badly at baseball?

03:14.161 --> 03:16.795
Maybe it's because you
were never there to teach me.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.232
Right. That's why every
NBA player without a father

03:20.234 --> 03:23.302
turned out spazzy.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.838
Edna, do we have
any Gatorade?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.474
What have you done
to deserve Gatorade?

03:31.177 --> 03:33.178
Gatorade is a reward.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.081
What water and salt
was lost from your body

03:36.083 --> 03:39.251
that needs to be
replenished?

03:39.253 --> 03:43.155
The tears from when you
took a called third strike?

03:44.257 --> 03:47.092
This is how you make up
for abandoning me?

03:47.094 --> 03:50.195
By insulting me after
I've let you live with me?

03:50.197 --> 03:51.663
When I didn't live with you,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.833
I didn't know
how bad you stunk.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.835
(stammers)

03:56.837 --> 03:58.270
You know what?

03:58.272 --> 04:00.105
Forget it.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.273
Edna.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.676
I found 28 cents
in right field
for your change jar.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.846
What are you, uh,
doing with all that money?

04:07.848 --> 04:11.850
I want to send my cousin, Señor
Junior, to junior college.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.919
What's he doing now?

04:13.921 --> 04:17.489
Señor Junior stay back
in junior high.

04:18.891 --> 04:23.462
Now Señor Junior high
school senior, señor.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.297
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

04:26.432 --> 04:27.332
<i>Sí.</i>

04:29.369 --> 04:30.902
I mean, Nicholson is hammered
all the time

04:30.904 --> 04:33.272
and he makes millions.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.541
And the, and the pope drinks
wine, for Pete's sake.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.310
So, uh...

04:38.312 --> 04:40.379
you guys really decided
to quit drinking?

04:40.381 --> 04:41.713
(chuckles):
Yes, you bet.
Mm.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.282
Um, could you

04:43.284 --> 04:45.050
hand me that
hand sanitizer, please?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.051
Oh.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.719
Thank you so much.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.155
Crawford!

04:51.324 --> 04:53.292
What is the matter with you?!

04:53.294 --> 04:54.660
I don't know.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.296
I mean, my body feels
like I was happily dead

04:57.298 --> 04:59.464
and then I was violently
brought back to life

04:59.466 --> 05:01.900
by some horrible experiment.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.337
(low grunting)

05:06.572 --> 05:10.242
Can we please get some more gum
in this office?!

05:11.511 --> 05:15.580
I'm so sick and tired of working
in a freaking gum-less office!

05:17.283 --> 05:19.685
Hey, so what brought on
this whole "no drinking" thing?

05:19.687 --> 05:21.953
Dad peed on the couch
and then Camila overreacted,

05:21.955 --> 05:23.922
and now the three of us
aren't drinking.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.325
Oh, Camila quit, too?

05:26.327 --> 05:27.492
Yeah, but she's fine--
you know,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.528
she doesn't drink
as much as we do.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.863
(laughs):
I don't need red wine.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.666
<i>You...</i> need red wine.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.158
So, what's it like
not drinking?

06:00.160 --> 06:03.795
It's like being Mormon
except you only get one wife.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.166
(chuckles): This is
never gonna work, man.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.701
No, no, no, no, no.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.969
It's gonna work,
it's gonna work.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.972
Hey, does your pot dealer
sell heroin?

06:17.143 --> 06:19.211
(quietly):
Hey.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.093
So, no drinking, huh?

06:36.729 --> 06:40.165
What the hell are we gonna do
from 5:00 to 11:00?

06:40.167 --> 06:43.101
We could play charades.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.508
I would rather read the Bible
with a gun in my mouth.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.510
Okay, what about hobbies?

06:51.512 --> 06:54.246
Crawford, you must have some
hobbies after all these years.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.582
Hmm. You know, I think
you might have something there,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.451
little missy.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.119
I'll be right back.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.624
If he brings back the scissors,
I get the first haircut.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.526
Still wet!

07:08.895 --> 07:11.096
Here you go, son.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.231
Oh, Dad, no, I don't want
to play guitar, man.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.467
Oh, here, here, here.
I don't want to play guitar.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.436
You know, it
might help us.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.038
Take our minds off not drinking.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.041
ALL (sighing quietly):
Drinking.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.913
(playing gentle melody)

07:27.915 --> 07:30.549
Hey, not bad, Crawford.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.584
Come on, Warner.

07:32.586 --> 07:36.354
(playing blues)

07:38.624 --> 07:41.660
There we go.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.994
Yeah!

07:46.499 --> 07:49.668
(blues continue)

07:49.670 --> 07:51.336
Whoo!

07:53.005 --> 07:54.339
Hey, whoa, whoa,

07:54.341 --> 07:56.475
whoa, whoa.
(imitating tapping cymbals)

08:02.315 --> 08:04.249
Camila...

08:04.251 --> 08:06.284
it was Simon & Garfunkel,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.487
not Simon, Garfunkel
& Garfunkel's wife

08:08.489 --> 08:10.655
banging on a table.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.757
(resume playing blues)

08:12.759 --> 08:14.326
¶

08:14.328 --> 08:16.995
(singing lively melody)

08:19.665 --> 08:22.334
Whoa!

08:23.669 --> 08:25.837
Edna, what are you
still doing here?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.573
You got something
to tell me, <i>ese?</i>

08:31.143 --> 08:33.678
Actually, I do.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.482
I was thinking that I want
my socks to be rolled
into balls from now on,

08:37.484 --> 08:38.683
instead of folded together.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.051
Hmm.

08:43.723 --> 08:45.724
Are you stealing from me?!

08:45.726 --> 08:47.158
What?!

08:47.160 --> 08:49.961
The jar. Change was...

08:49.963 --> 08:51.696
up here.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.065
Now... down here.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.704
Why would I steal your change?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.006
Ha!

09:01.008 --> 09:03.575
Look around this apartment.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.013
You TV, you stereo,

09:08.015 --> 09:09.648
this plant.

09:11.417 --> 09:14.886
You living pretty high,
<i>muchacho.</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:20.592
Edna, I'm... I'm not
stealing your change.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.928
I gave you change, remember?
Yesterday.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.330
Yes.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.165
That's true.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.569
So am I still a suspect?

09:30.571 --> 09:33.038
You free to go.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.773
But...

09:34.775 --> 09:36.908
no leave town.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.611
You still <i>hombre</i> of interest.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.782
(electronic tones sound)

09:44.750 --> 09:46.451
(quiet sigh)

09:46.453 --> 09:48.853
(electronic tones sound)

09:51.357 --> 09:52.791
(electronic tones sound)

09:52.793 --> 09:56.027
What's happening
with your phone?!

09:56.029 --> 09:58.697
Edna's convinced that my dad
is stealing change from her,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.031
so she keeps sending me

10:00.033 --> 10:01.766
these threatening
text messages for him.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.868
Check this out.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.871
"I kill him during
he watch loud opera."

10:08.641 --> 10:13.445
"I fry-pan his head
during Geo-purdy."

10:13.447 --> 10:16.715
"I make blender angry
at his hand fingers." Like...

10:18.050 --> 10:19.818
You sure a dog
didn't just grab her phone

10:19.820 --> 10:22.220
and start randomly
biting buttons?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.756
Hi, guys. How's the
no-drinking going?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.291
Uh, yeah, not bad,
actually.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.227
Yeah. We're filling up
the time by writing songs.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.428
Songs?
Mm-hmm.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.730
I didn't know
you guys played music.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.068
WARNER: Would you like
to hear something?
Nope.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.104
This is a
workplace,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.906
not two idiots
on a college quad.

10:41.908 --> 10:45.410
Come on. Song! Let's get a song,
right, guys? Song!
(Warner and Crawford protesting)

10:45.412 --> 10:47.245
A song! Song!
Eli, no, no.
No. No. No.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.847
(chanting):
Song! Song! Song!
No, no!

10:48.849 --> 10:51.816
Song! Song! Song...
CRAWFORD:
No!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.518
A minor.
(playing guitars)

10:56.255 --> 11:00.925
¶ My daddy was
a drunken loser ¶

11:00.927 --> 11:04.462
¶ I was raised
by a drunken dad ¶

11:04.464 --> 11:07.632
¶ Like me,
I became ¶

11:07.634 --> 11:09.634
¶ A boozer

11:09.636 --> 11:13.204
¶ And I raised you
as a drunken dad ¶

11:13.206 --> 11:14.706
¶ But

11:14.708 --> 11:19.010
¶ I still made it
to your wedding on time ¶

11:19.012 --> 11:23.314
¶ You drove the car
through the reception line ¶

11:23.316 --> 11:25.650
¶ Back then
drunk driving wasn't ¶

11:25.652 --> 11:27.819
¶ Such a crime

11:27.821 --> 11:30.855
¶ Raised by a drunken dad

11:30.857 --> 11:32.457
Take it, Warner.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.526
(playing recorder)

11:41.567 --> 11:43.568
¶ A good dad

11:43.570 --> 11:45.537
¶ I could not be

11:45.539 --> 11:48.073
¶ I was raised by a drunken

11:48.075 --> 11:50.709
¶ Dad

11:50.711 --> 11:54.913
¶ And the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree ¶

11:54.915 --> 11:58.083
¶ My son is a drunken dad

11:58.085 --> 11:59.818
¶ So sad

11:59.820 --> 12:03.388
¶ My son is a drunken

12:03.390 --> 12:06.458
¶ Dad.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.663
(applause)

12:13.599 --> 12:14.933
That was really moving.

12:14.935 --> 12:15.934
Well, it was emotional.

12:15.936 --> 12:19.070
Yeah. Cool beans, huh?
Listen,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.072
I run the local
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Uh-huh.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.742
And I was wondering
if you guys would come down

12:23.744 --> 12:25.076
and play at a meeting.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.346
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, th-that'd be great.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.382
Cool. Thanks. Awesome.
(chuckles)
WARNER: Okay.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.585
Warner...

12:33.587 --> 12:37.655
we just got signed
by Capitol Records.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.627
Dad, I-I think
you're still drying out.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.196
He just asked us to play
at an A.A. meeting.

12:45.198 --> 12:49.234
Well, I guess we should
do what the label says.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.203
EDNA:
Mr. Eli,
Yeah.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.939
here your sock how you want.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.610
No.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.146
No, Edna. I-I meant
that each sock would be rolled

13:01.148 --> 13:05.216
into a tiny ball, not all
of them in one big ball.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.386
Oh, boy.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.455
You no gonna like your shirts.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.159
Hello.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.894
Hey. Where you been?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.996
I got a flu shot
at the pharmacy.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.964
Because who better
to administer medical care

13:19.966 --> 13:23.835
than the guy who puts price tags
on flip-flops?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.837
Nice watch.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.139
Oh, thank you. It's new.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.174
Where'd you get it?

13:29.176 --> 13:31.009
Excuse me, Mr. David.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.844
Where's my money, bitch?!
Hey, hey.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.981
What are you talking about?

13:36.983 --> 13:40.018
Dad, are you stealing change
from Edna's jar?

13:40.020 --> 13:43.154
Stealing? Stealing?

13:43.156 --> 13:46.024
Oh, because I can't have
beautiful things?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.158
I'm the one

13:47.160 --> 13:48.593
who was robbed.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.961
Of my dignity!

13:49.963 --> 13:51.696
Good day!

13:52.865 --> 13:54.632
There's something
I want to watch on TV.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.868
Pretend I stormed out.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.909
(jingling)

14:24.196 --> 14:26.130
You steal my change!

14:26.132 --> 14:29.067
No, I didn't. Check your jar.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.136
It's full,
isn't it?

14:32.138 --> 14:33.905
I think you owe me an apology.

14:33.907 --> 14:37.008
I sorry.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.410
I don't accept your apology.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.046
You have disgraced Jesus.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.882
(jingling)

14:46.218 --> 14:47.886
Wait a second.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.687
This no my jar.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.489
This jar smaller.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.558
Or Edna bigger.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.561
Let me see that.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.863
Hey, you're right.
That is smaller.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.164
Let's take him out, man!

15:00.166 --> 15:02.767
Hey... wait...

15:02.769 --> 15:05.737
Let's follow him and catch him
in the act.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.574
No. I catch him
in the act last week.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.578
He had laptop on sink.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.580
Wait a minute,
he doesn't have a laptop.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.782
Oh, that was mine.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.754
Hello, my name is Bob T.,

15:22.756 --> 15:24.555
and I'm an alcoholic.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.725
OTHERS:
We know.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.728
Okay. So,
let's get this meeting started

15:30.730 --> 15:34.032
and give a special welcome
to two new attendees,

15:34.034 --> 15:35.566
Crawford and Warner.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.136
OTHERS:
Hi, Crawford and Warner.
Hi. Hi.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.139
These guys are here
to open the meeting with

15:41.141 --> 15:42.540
an inspirational song

15:42.542 --> 15:44.709
that I think everyone here
can relate to.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.544
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for
having us. Yeah.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.313
Keep fighting, gang.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.381
Hopefully this will help.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.116
Okay.

15:52.118 --> 15:56.487
¶ Sometimes life
can be so tough ¶

15:56.489 --> 15:59.324
¶ You want to scream
"I've had enough" ¶

15:59.326 --> 16:02.093
¶ At times like that we know

16:02.095 --> 16:05.997
¶ Just what
you think ¶

16:05.999 --> 16:09.834
¶ But keep that bottle
on the shelf ¶

16:09.836 --> 16:12.971
¶ Look in the mirror
and ask yourself ¶

16:12.973 --> 16:16.341
¶ "Now,
do I really need ¶

16:16.343 --> 16:19.444
¶ This drink?"

16:19.446 --> 16:21.846
We're losing 'em, Dad.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.148
Yeah. I know.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.783
Maybe we should do the one
we wrote this morning.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.186
No, no, no, no. It's not
ready, it's not ready.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.021
Yeah, but it's...
Warner, it's our only hope.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.790
We can all hear you.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.159
Well,

16:35.161 --> 16:37.528
as I've just said, the musical
question... (chuckles)

16:37.530 --> 16:41.332
¶ Do I really need this drink?

16:43.268 --> 16:45.770
Well, the answer is... yes.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.606
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up

16:48.608 --> 16:51.175
¶ It'll get you
through the day ¶

16:51.177 --> 16:53.778
¶ Bottoms up,
bottoms up ¶

16:53.780 --> 16:56.180
¶ That's the alcoholic way

16:56.182 --> 16:58.783
¶ Fly away
from it all ¶

16:58.785 --> 17:00.985
¶ On the wings of alcohol

17:00.987 --> 17:03.388
¶ Have a drink, have a ball

17:03.390 --> 17:05.390
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up

17:05.392 --> 17:06.557
Take it, Warner.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.626
(whistling softly)

17:11.697 --> 17:13.698
Sorry.
¶ Bottoms up

17:13.700 --> 17:15.066
¶ Bottoms up

17:15.068 --> 17:17.235
¶ That's how we start the day

17:17.237 --> 17:18.903
¶ Bottoms up

17:18.905 --> 17:22.573
¶ Bottoms up,
and work turns into play ¶

17:22.575 --> 17:24.575
¶ And who cares if you find

17:24.577 --> 17:27.078
¶ That you're slowly
going blind ¶

17:27.080 --> 17:29.714
¶ You'll be drunk,
you won't mind ¶

17:29.716 --> 17:32.216
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up

17:32.218 --> 17:33.651
Everybody!
¶ Bottoms up

17:33.653 --> 17:34.819
ALL:
¶ Bottoms up

17:34.821 --> 17:37.422
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up

17:37.424 --> 17:39.724
¶ Bottoms up,
bottoms up ¶

17:39.726 --> 17:41.926
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up

17:41.928 --> 17:43.261
¶ Look around

17:43.263 --> 17:45.730
¶ Watch the
news, it'll ¶

17:45.732 --> 17:48.166
¶ Give you the blues

17:49.101 --> 17:51.669
¶ That's why God gave us booze

17:51.671 --> 17:54.739
¶ Bottoms up, bottoms up.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.075
Hey, Dave.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.710
OTHERS:
Dave!

17:59.712 --> 18:01.412
How's life treating you,
Mr. Sachs?

18:01.414 --> 18:05.716
The world's a giant dog turd
and I'm a plastic bag.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.752
You gonna get that thing today
or what?

18:07.754 --> 18:11.155
Got two pockets full of hope.
(jingling)

18:13.125 --> 18:16.561
What the hell is my
dad doing at this bar?

18:16.563 --> 18:21.099
Maybe he have sex with men
in bathroom for change.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.166
Come on.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.569
EDNA:
Aha!

18:24.571 --> 18:26.304
My change!

18:26.306 --> 18:28.439
What?!
Dad,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.241
is that Edna's change?

18:30.243 --> 18:32.777
Did you follow me
all the way here?
Yes!

18:32.779 --> 18:34.979
And what were you doing
for an hour in that store

18:34.981 --> 18:37.148
that sells wheelchairs
and bedpans?

18:37.150 --> 18:41.219
You don't want to wait till you
need a bedpan to get a bedpan.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.254
I kill you, muchacho!

18:43.256 --> 18:45.556
Hold on, hold on.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.325
I can explain.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.327
Look.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.163
I felt really bad about
all that stuff I said to you

18:52.165 --> 18:54.132
after the softball game

18:54.134 --> 18:57.168
and how you felt about me
abandoning you. I thought maybe

18:57.170 --> 18:58.903
I could make it up
to you a little,

18:58.905 --> 19:01.139
so I'm trying to get you
that Bionic Baby toy

19:01.141 --> 19:02.573
you loved as a kid.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.308
Bionic Baby?

19:04.310 --> 19:08.179
The one you threw out the car
window after Grandma's funeral?

19:08.181 --> 19:11.349
Yes. Anyway, I couldn't find
anyplace that sold them,

19:11.351 --> 19:14.318
so I tracked down the only place
that had one, here,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.921
in this game.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.757
Bionic Baby!

19:19.759 --> 19:22.927
Oh, my gosh! I can see him!
He's at the bottom!

19:22.929 --> 19:24.595
I didn't think it was
gonna be so hard to get,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.797
but after I spent
the only 40 bucks I had trying

19:26.799 --> 19:30.501
to grab that sucker, I started
borrowing Edna's change.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.537
Stealing!

19:32.539 --> 19:35.139
I was gonna pay it back,
I swear.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.508
I'm gonna get you, Bionic Baby!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.610
Can I have five beers, please?
Same for me, please!

19:39.612 --> 19:42.280
That's not a good idea.
No, no. No, no.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.314
CRAWFORD:
Now, hold on!

19:43.316 --> 19:45.716
No, no. Hold-hold on!
Hold on! Hold on!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.351
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!

19:47.353 --> 19:48.219
Crawford?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.353
David?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.154
Warner?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.056
Edna?

19:52.058 --> 19:53.658
If you're here
for Bionic Baby,

19:53.660 --> 19:57.862
you're gonna have to go
through me and her.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.730
What are you
talking about?

19:59.732 --> 20:00.865
CRAWFORD:
No, we're here

20:00.867 --> 20:02.667
to keep these A.A. people
from drinking.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.202
Hurry, Warner.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.071
¶ There's a new libation
that is sweeping ¶

20:07.073 --> 20:09.073
¶ The nation

20:09.075 --> 20:11.375
¶ It's called water

20:11.377 --> 20:13.477
WARNER:
¶ Water

20:13.479 --> 20:16.314
CRAWFORD:
¶ It's called water.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.555
(playing soft melody)

20:26.758 --> 20:29.193
So, you guys are drinking again?
Yeah,

20:29.195 --> 20:33.064
we decided that music destroys
more lives than alcohol.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.098
ELI:
No!

20:34.100 --> 20:36.934
Oh, come on!

20:38.403 --> 20:41.906
How much did you pay for that
box of soon-to-be ocean garbage?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.508
I didn't. My dad and Edna and I
carried it out

20:44.510 --> 20:46.344
when those two started
a drunken riot.

20:47.846 --> 20:50.114
Hey, how's it going?
Did you get it yet?

20:50.116 --> 20:52.450
No, no, no. Just
all this junk.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.785
No. This not junk.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.687
This is Saturday night out.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.257
Ooh! Ooh!

20:59.259 --> 21:03.928
Well, Edna and I have
a little surprise for you.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.097
We turned over your couch.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.465
(exhales)

21:07.467 --> 21:09.467
That's awesome.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.135
Thank you.

21:11.137 --> 21:14.272
Now you play
until you get Bionic Baby.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.375
Or...

21:19.278 --> 21:21.345
...you could just...

21:30.722 --> 21:33.324
...do that.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.493
Bionic Baby!

21:35.495 --> 21:37.928
(sputters, zooming sounds)

21:37.930 --> 21:41.265
Now, no more Bionic Baby,

21:41.267 --> 21:42.566
no more songs,

21:42.568 --> 21:45.369
and back to work.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.373
<i>Vámonos.</i>
