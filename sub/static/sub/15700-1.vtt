00:19.567 --> 00:20.942
<i>Michael.</i>

00:21.108 --> 00:24.067
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?</i>

00:24.233 --> 00:25.525
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

00:25.733 --> 00:28.442
<i>And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.</i>

00:28.608 --> 00:31.900
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...
Just please hear me out.</i>

00:32.067 --> 00:35.275
<i>Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.</i>

00:35.442 --> 00:38.025
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.</i>

00:38.192 --> 00:41.025
<i>Try and make believe
this is not just madness...</i>

00:41.192 --> 00:44.192
<i>... because this is not just madness.</i>

00:44.567 --> 00:46.817
<i>Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?</i>

00:46.983 --> 00:49.525
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting...</i>

00:49.692 --> 00:52.858
<i>... I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

00:53.067 --> 00:55.817
<i>There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...</i>

00:55.983 --> 00:58.525
<i>... scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.</i>

00:58.692 --> 01:01.608
<i>And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...</i>

01:01.775 --> 01:05.775
<i>... the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

01:05.942 --> 01:07.983
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

01:08.150 --> 01:10.775
<i>I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

01:10.942 --> 01:12.983
<i>... that I'm covered
with some sort of film.</i>

01:13.150 --> 01:17.733
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

01:17.900 --> 01:20.692
<i>And at first I thought,
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

01:20.858 --> 01:23.275
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.</i>

01:23.442 --> 01:25.150
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

01:25.317 --> 01:27.983
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn."</i>

01:28.150 --> 01:31.442
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

01:31.608 --> 01:35.650
<i>... this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

01:35.817 --> 01:38.692
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion
of renewal...</i>

01:38.858 --> 01:41.608
<i>... that happens in
the final moment before death."</i>

01:41.775 --> 01:45.358
<i>And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

01:45.567 --> 01:48.525
<i>... because I looked back
at the building...</i>

01:48.692 --> 01:51.317
<i>... and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.</i>

01:51.483 --> 01:53.567
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

01:53.733 --> 01:57.775
<i>... that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

01:57.942 --> 02:01.233
<i>... not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

02:01.400 --> 02:04.192
<i>... but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:09.025
<i>... whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...</i>

02:09.192 --> 02:12.525
<i>... the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...</i>

02:12.733 --> 02:16.275
<i>... more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

02:16.442 --> 02:20.317
<i>And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...</i>

02:20.483 --> 02:22.692
<i>... for the best part of my life.</i>

02:22.858 --> 02:26.692
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

02:26.858 --> 02:28.108
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

02:28.275 --> 02:32.025
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

02:32.192 --> 02:36.567
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

02:36.733 --> 02:40.942
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

02:41.108 --> 02:43.567
<i>It must stand the test of time."</i>

02:43.733 --> 02:46.775
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

02:49.358 --> 02:52.233
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.942
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.</i>

02:55.108 --> 02:59.358
<i>So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

02:59.525 --> 03:02.192
<i>Because I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.</i>

03:02.400 --> 03:03.692
What does that exactly mean?

03:03.900 --> 03:06.275
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

03:13.275 --> 03:15.025
We found 97.

03:21.608 --> 03:24.733
<i>I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.</i>

03:24.900 --> 03:27.067
She will not go away.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.025
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

03:32.233 --> 03:35.317
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

03:35.483 --> 03:38.692
<i>... about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

03:38.900 --> 03:42.233
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

03:42.400 --> 03:44.275
...pending and unresolved.

03:44.442 --> 03:47.025
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

03:47.233 --> 03:50.692
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.942
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:58.567
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

03:58.733 --> 04:01.192
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

04:01.358 --> 04:04.817
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

04:05.025 --> 04:07.483
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

04:08.608 --> 04:10.650
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.067
I'll see the turn.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.608
Check.

05:10.108 --> 05:11.358
Check.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.108
Check.

05:13.275 --> 05:15.275
Half the pot. Two hundred.

05:15.442 --> 05:17.150
Two hundred to go.

05:28.233 --> 05:29.525
You don't remember me, huh?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.025
We played together a couple times.

05:33.192 --> 05:35.275
That lamp place on Bowery.

05:35.442 --> 05:38.108
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

05:38.733 --> 05:40.692
- The Galaxy.
- That's it.

05:40.858 --> 05:44.025
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

05:44.233 --> 05:47.442
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.025
- You don't remember me?
- I remember you.

05:51.192 --> 05:53.442
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

05:54.192 --> 05:55.942
You bought some hair too.

05:56.608 --> 05:58.400
With your money.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.692
So, what happened with the bar?

06:01.858 --> 06:03.608
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

06:03.775 --> 06:07.942
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

06:08.108 --> 06:10.567
That was a good location.

06:10.733 --> 06:13.567
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept telling me.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.567
Action's on you.

06:16.192 --> 06:17.942
I bet the pot.

06:20.692 --> 06:22.525
Good to see you again.

06:55.275 --> 06:56.275
Hello?

06:56.442 --> 06:57.692
<i>- Michael.
- Walter.</i>

06:57.900 --> 07:01.108
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.</i>

07:01.275 --> 07:05.358
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

07:05.567 --> 07:07.442
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

07:07.608 --> 07:08.608
Just now?

07:08.775 --> 07:11.442
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.</i>

07:11.608 --> 07:13.692
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

07:13.858 --> 07:15.025
Where?

07:15.192 --> 07:19.025
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

07:19.192 --> 07:20.192
Is he drunk?

07:20.400 --> 07:23.233
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.</i>

07:23.400 --> 07:24.900
Tell him to stay off the phone.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.358
<i>All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?</i>

07:27.525 --> 07:29.275
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

07:29.858 --> 07:32.025
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

07:32.192 --> 07:33.608
I'm walking to the car right now.

07:33.775 --> 07:37.150
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.</i>

07:37.317 --> 07:40.900
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

07:41.067 --> 07:42.525
All right. I'll be in the car.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.817
<i>What they did, see,
they changed the grade there.</i>

08:38.983 --> 08:40.775
They widened the street.

08:40.942 --> 08:43.858
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

08:44.025 --> 08:48.525
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

08:48.692 --> 08:52.275
...and they've got these new...
These... These...

08:52.442 --> 08:54.525
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.983
- That corner there. It is blinding.
- They'll have to work that out.

08:58.150 --> 09:00.983
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

09:01.150 --> 09:05.775
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

09:05.942 --> 09:08.192
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

09:08.400 --> 09:13.317
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

09:13.483 --> 09:16.400
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

09:16.567 --> 09:18.150
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.525
Well, that sounds ominous.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.275
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

09:24.442 --> 09:27.400
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.358
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.483
A trial lawyer.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.525
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

09:33.733 --> 09:37.275
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

09:37.442 --> 09:40.442
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

09:40.608 --> 09:44.358
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

09:44.525 --> 09:48.192
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

09:48.358 --> 09:50.400
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

09:50.567 --> 09:51.817
I suggest you go local...

09:51.983 --> 09:54.858
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

09:55.025 --> 09:57.067
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

09:57.233 --> 09:59.275
Hey, you believe this?

09:59.442 --> 10:01.733
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 12 years!

10:01.900 --> 10:05.650
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

10:05.817 --> 10:09.108
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

10:09.275 --> 10:11.483
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.858
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.900
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.983
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

10:21.150 --> 10:22.900
I don't know what Walter
promised you...

10:23.067 --> 10:26.525
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

10:26.733 --> 10:29.817
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

10:29.983 --> 10:31.608
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

10:31.775 --> 10:34.358
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.025
Elliot.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.483
The guy was running! In the street!

10:39.650 --> 10:44.358
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle...

10:45.900 --> 10:49.358
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

10:49.567 --> 10:51.733
You answer me that!

11:05.067 --> 11:07.442
What if someone had stolen the car?

11:10.567 --> 11:11.775
Happens all the time.

11:11.942 --> 11:14.025
Cops like hit-and-runs.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.233
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.608
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

11:19.775 --> 11:23.108
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

11:23.275 --> 11:25.525
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

11:25.692 --> 11:27.275
And the guy you hit?

11:27.442 --> 11:30.817
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

11:34.025 --> 11:35.733
There's no play here.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.858
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.692
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.942
The math on this is simple.

11:44.108 --> 11:47.108
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

11:48.233 --> 11:52.358
That's the police, isn't it?

11:52.567 --> 11:53.942
No.

11:54.775 --> 11:56.442
They don't call.

12:01.192 --> 12:02.525
Hello.

12:03.608 --> 12:05.900
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.567
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.608
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.858
You got a pen?

15:56.108 --> 15:58.192
Mom, where's my cards?

16:03.233 --> 16:05.067
Where's my cards?

16:19.275 --> 16:20.608
Is my other deck in here?

16:20.775 --> 16:22.192
Did you eat?

16:22.358 --> 16:24.233
Dad's down there waiting already.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.275
There were cards in our bathroom.

16:26.442 --> 16:27.692
Yes, I had a waffle.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.733
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.233
It's a miracle.

16:36.025 --> 16:37.525
Gloves?

16:44.358 --> 16:45.317
Henry!

16:50.108 --> 16:51.525
Come on.

16:53.525 --> 16:54.858
Get in.

16:57.108 --> 16:58.442
Got it?

17:04.275 --> 17:06.858
<i>So no one's even sure
exactly where they are...</i>

17:07.025 --> 17:10.192
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

17:10.358 --> 17:13.067
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.442
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

17:16.608 --> 17:17.608
Right.

17:17.775 --> 17:21.233
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.567
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.650
This is where they all came.

17:26.817 --> 17:29.817
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

17:29.983 --> 17:32.025
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

17:32.192 --> 17:35.358
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.

17:35.817 --> 17:37.525
And nobody has any alliances.

17:37.733 --> 17:40.983
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

17:41.150 --> 17:43.150
...maybe the person you're talking to...

17:43.317 --> 17:45.817
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.692
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.192
Sounds familiar.

17:50.358 --> 17:53.275
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

17:53.442 --> 17:56.608
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

17:56.775 --> 17:59.525
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?

18:00.275 --> 18:02.525
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.567
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

18:05.733 --> 18:07.192
- The book?
- Yes.

18:07.358 --> 18:08.733
Bring it on Saturday, I'll...

18:08.900 --> 18:12.150
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

18:12.317 --> 18:13.442
Okay.

18:13.608 --> 18:16.025
Well, here we go.

18:16.192 --> 18:18.858
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

18:22.983 --> 18:25.483
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah, kiddo.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.067
Thanks.

18:35.317 --> 18:38.817
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,
assorted sizes.</i>

18:39.025 --> 18:41.983
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.</i>

18:42.150 --> 18:45.233
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.650
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

18:47.817 --> 18:50.317
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

18:50.525 --> 18:52.900
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.817
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.692
He says you're still gonna be short.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.608
How short?

19:13.775 --> 19:17.192
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

19:17.358 --> 19:20.400
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?

19:20.567 --> 19:23.567
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

19:23.733 --> 19:27.608
He took 1500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.400
Make a bid.

19:31.150 --> 19:33.650
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

19:33.817 --> 19:35.858
Just lying around, no.

19:37.942 --> 19:40.483
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.

19:40.650 --> 19:41.650
Forget that.

19:41.858 --> 19:46.150
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

19:46.317 --> 19:49.525
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

19:50.025 --> 19:54.317
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

19:54.483 --> 19:58.192
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

19:58.358 --> 20:00.150
He's gotta have something.

20:00.317 --> 20:01.817
He's got the two kids with her.

20:01.983 --> 20:05.650
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

20:05.817 --> 20:10.483
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.525
Make an offer.

20:16.025 --> 20:20.358
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

20:20.525 --> 20:25.067
But live like that? Even they do a program...
She did, I think, once, two years.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.233
And then they slip? Forget it.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.775
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

20:30.775 --> 20:32.942
What's my timeframe here?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.275
I don't know.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.442
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.567
I'll ask.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.275
- Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.

21:18.525 --> 21:21.775
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

21:21.942 --> 21:23.942
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.442
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave
he can be right now.</i>

21:26.608 --> 21:28.942
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled.</i>

21:29.108 --> 21:30.525
Any chance she knows that?

21:30.692 --> 21:34.317
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

21:34.483 --> 21:36.983
<i>She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.</i>

21:37.192 --> 21:38.400
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

21:38.567 --> 21:40.692
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.942
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

21:42.108 --> 21:45.650
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

21:45.817 --> 21:47.025
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

21:47.192 --> 21:50.442
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

21:50.608 --> 21:52.525
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

21:52.692 --> 21:54.650
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

21:54.858 --> 21:56.025
Thanks.

21:56.192 --> 21:57.817
Hey, where are we with Marty?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.317
We left word.

22:00.483 --> 22:02.650
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

22:02.817 --> 22:04.817
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

22:04.983 --> 22:06.650
<i>- This is Miami?
- Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

22:06.817 --> 22:08.317
And they charged him.

22:08.483 --> 22:11.775
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client...</i>

22:11.942 --> 22:17.400
<i>I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

22:17.567 --> 22:19.608
<i>- Yeah.
- Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

22:19.775 --> 22:22.317
<i>- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.</i>

22:23.067 --> 22:26.108
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

22:26.275 --> 22:27.525
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

22:27.692 --> 22:30.150
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

22:30.358 --> 22:33.692
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

22:33.858 --> 22:35.400
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

22:35.567 --> 22:36.900
He's a former commissioner.

22:37.067 --> 22:40.025
<i>None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:42.275
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

22:42.442 --> 22:44.775
<i>- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

22:46.567 --> 22:47.858
Are we merging?

22:48.858 --> 22:50.525
Marty Bach's in London.

22:50.733 --> 22:53.817
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

22:53.983 --> 22:56.108
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.858
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

22:59.025 --> 23:02.192
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.525
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

23:04.692 --> 23:06.483
Like I would know.

23:07.108 --> 23:08.358
I don't know.

23:08.525 --> 23:12.192
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

23:12.942 --> 23:14.608
Your phone's ringing.

23:15.483 --> 23:16.942
Evan?

23:17.733 --> 23:20.483
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.608
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

23:23.775 --> 23:26.192
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction...

23:26.358 --> 23:29.900
<i>At the moment,
U/North currently has 70,000 employees...</i>

23:30.067 --> 23:33.108
<i>... in 62 countries around the world.</i>

23:34.692 --> 23:36.317
<i>Around the planet.</i>

23:37.442 --> 23:41.192
<i>Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.</i>

23:42.275 --> 23:47.025
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.858
We have... We have, right now...
We have...

23:53.025 --> 23:56.233
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

23:56.400 --> 23:59.192
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

23:59.358 --> 24:02.108
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...

24:02.275 --> 24:04.025
...so you can imagine...

24:04.192 --> 24:07.608
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is...

24:07.775 --> 24:09.233
Overwhelming.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.650
It's just enormous.

24:13.150 --> 24:16.442
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues...

24:17.733 --> 24:20.025
It's quite substantial.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.775
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

24:22.942 --> 24:25.150
...what our in-house department does...

24:25.317 --> 24:30.567
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

24:30.733 --> 24:33.067
...to determine the jurisdiction...

24:33.233 --> 24:35.483
...and to outsource our business...

24:35.650 --> 24:39.108
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

24:39.525 --> 24:42.150
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

24:42.317 --> 24:45.650
<i>... how do you keep a balance
between work and life?</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:47.275
<i>Balance?</i>

24:49.858 --> 24:53.108
I think that's... That's something that...

24:53.275 --> 24:56.608
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

24:56.775 --> 24:59.567
It's a shifting balance, really.

24:59.733 --> 25:02.900
It's, you know, you... You try to...

25:03.067 --> 25:06.358
<i>When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...</i>

25:06.567 --> 25:08.400
...who needs balance?

25:09.525 --> 25:11.983
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

25:12.192 --> 25:16.150
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

25:16.317 --> 25:18.483
When Don asked me to take...

25:18.650 --> 25:21.108
When Don Jeffries brought...
Don Jeffries brought me...

25:21.275 --> 25:24.233
Don Jeffries brought me in here
12 years ago...

25:24.400 --> 25:27.525
...trusted me, mentored me.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.650
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

25:31.358 --> 25:35.150
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

25:35.942 --> 25:39.483
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

25:39.650 --> 25:42.400
But, is it challenging? Yes.

25:42.567 --> 25:48.233
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

25:48.400 --> 25:53.525
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

25:53.692 --> 25:57.650
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

25:57.858 --> 25:59.692
...you're in the wrong place.

25:59.858 --> 26:04.942
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and...

26:05.775 --> 26:07.525
We're in the middle of an interview.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.692
They said it was urgent.

26:11.692 --> 26:13.150
Jesus.

26:13.858 --> 26:15.650
For chrissake.

26:17.233 --> 26:19.067
You're saying he did this in...?

26:19.233 --> 26:20.317
Oh, my God.

26:20.483 --> 26:23.150
- Barry.
- Hang on.

26:23.650 --> 26:28.775
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

26:30.775 --> 26:32.108
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

26:32.275 --> 26:35.942
<i>... I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

26:36.108 --> 26:40.900
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

26:41.067 --> 26:44.858
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

26:45.025 --> 26:47.983
<i>It must stand the test of time."</i>

26:48.192 --> 26:50.942
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

26:51.108 --> 26:54.567
<i>This moment, today,
here, this room, this air...</i>

26:54.733 --> 26:59.150
<i>... and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.</i>

26:59.317 --> 27:01.108
<i>There's a reason.</i>

27:01.275 --> 27:02.983
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

27:03.150 --> 27:07.650
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

27:07.817 --> 27:11.525
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

27:11.733 --> 27:13.983
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,
for God's sake.</i>

27:14.483 --> 27:19.275
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

27:19.442 --> 27:23.150
It was... It was... It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

27:23.317 --> 27:26.400
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

27:26.567 --> 27:29.942
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

27:30.692 --> 27:34.858
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

27:35.025 --> 27:38.733
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

27:38.900 --> 27:42.192
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

27:42.358 --> 27:44.775
...85,000 documents in discovery.

27:44.942 --> 27:49.150
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

27:49.317 --> 27:53.775
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

27:53.942 --> 27:56.025
- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.150
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

27:59.317 --> 28:00.650
He's got some champagne.

28:00.817 --> 28:05.567
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

28:05.733 --> 28:09.275
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

28:09.442 --> 28:12.858
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

28:13.025 --> 28:17.108
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna...

28:17.275 --> 28:19.567
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

28:19.733 --> 28:22.983
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

28:23.150 --> 28:28.233
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year..."

28:28.400 --> 28:29.983
- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

28:30.150 --> 28:33.483
Because it's years! It's lives!

28:33.650 --> 28:36.483
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

28:36.650 --> 28:40.858
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

28:41.025 --> 28:42.400
I mean, is this me?

28:42.567 --> 28:46.900
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

28:47.067 --> 28:51.275
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

28:51.442 --> 28:53.442
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

28:53.608 --> 28:55.858
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?

28:56.025 --> 28:58.983
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

28:59.150 --> 29:01.692
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

29:01.900 --> 29:05.067
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

29:05.233 --> 29:06.900
- That was our agreement.
- Sue me.

29:07.067 --> 29:08.275
We okay in there?

29:09.233 --> 29:11.983
We're fine. We're fine.

29:15.525 --> 29:17.650
They killed them, Michael.

29:17.817 --> 29:21.025
Those small farms, the family farms.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.692
Did you...? Did you...?
Did you meet Anna?

29:23.900 --> 29:24.900
No.

29:25.067 --> 29:28.192
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

29:28.358 --> 29:30.317
She's God's perfect little creature.

29:30.525 --> 29:33.942
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12 percent of my life...

29:34.108 --> 29:37.733
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.692
When did you last take one of these?

29:39.858 --> 29:42.567
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

29:42.733 --> 29:45.192
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

29:45.358 --> 29:48.608
- If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.

29:48.775 --> 29:51.442
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

29:51.608 --> 29:54.317
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

29:54.483 --> 29:56.817
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a manic-depressive.

29:57.317 --> 30:00.275
I am Shiva, the god of death.

30:00.692 --> 30:03.650
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

30:05.150 --> 30:09.817
<i>We came back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...</i>

30:09.983 --> 30:13.983
<i>... and we were in shock, but we still...
We had to milk.</i>

30:14.192 --> 30:16.608
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

30:16.775 --> 30:17.775
<i>No.</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:20.983
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

30:21.150 --> 30:23.733
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

30:23.900 --> 30:26.150
<i>- From your mother?
- Yes.</i>

30:26.317 --> 30:28.317
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

30:29.025 --> 30:32.650
<i>Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.</i>

30:33.400 --> 30:36.067
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people..."</i>

30:36.233 --> 30:37.483
<i>Anna.</i>

30:38.150 --> 30:39.900
<i>- Anna.
- "Down at...</i>

30:40.067 --> 30:41.733
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

30:41.900 --> 30:43.817
<i>- I'm just...
- Excuse me.</i>

30:43.983 --> 30:46.067
<i>- Anna, they're...
- What's he doing?</i>

30:46.233 --> 30:48.942
<i>Excuse me. She's a...
No, this is testimony. This is...</i>

30:49.108 --> 30:51.108
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

30:51.275 --> 30:53.650
<i>You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.</i>

30:53.817 --> 30:55.525
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, l...</i>

30:55.692 --> 30:58.275
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

30:58.442 --> 31:03.358
<i>And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

31:03.525 --> 31:08.275
<i>... that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

31:08.442 --> 31:12.233
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

31:12.400 --> 31:14.317
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

31:14.900 --> 31:18.358
<i>- This is my offering!
- No, I want this on the record!</i>

31:18.567 --> 31:19.775
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

31:19.942 --> 31:23.483
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are
my offering. This is my shame.</i>

31:23.650 --> 31:26.400
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

31:26.567 --> 31:29.983
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God...</i>

31:37.692 --> 31:39.233
I guess that's it.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.692
When do we get Don?

31:48.317 --> 31:50.817
She said to try back in half an hour.

31:51.025 --> 31:53.900
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

31:55.150 --> 31:57.775
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.525
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.983
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

32:06.192 --> 32:10.317
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

32:12.108 --> 32:13.525
Michael Raymond Clayton.

32:13.733 --> 32:18.608
<i>Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

32:18.775 --> 32:22.483
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

32:22.650 --> 32:25.317
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

32:25.483 --> 32:28.650
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

32:28.817 --> 32:30.442
<i>... in 1977.</i>

32:30.608 --> 32:34.983
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.</i>

32:35.650 --> 32:40.150
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

32:40.317 --> 32:43.233
<i>1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

32:43.400 --> 32:45.358
<i>... Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

32:45.525 --> 32:48.900
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.525
So he's a partner?

32:51.400 --> 32:53.900
No. He's listed as special counsel.

32:54.067 --> 32:56.108
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

32:57.025 --> 32:59.650
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?</i>

32:59.817 --> 33:02.192
<i>He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?</i>

33:02.358 --> 33:06.025
<i>This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?</i>

33:20.233 --> 33:22.525
- Hi.
- Close the door.

33:22.983 --> 33:26.983
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

33:27.567 --> 33:29.400
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

33:29.567 --> 33:33.150
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

33:33.317 --> 33:37.900
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

33:38.067 --> 33:41.942
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

33:42.108 --> 33:44.608
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

33:44.775 --> 33:48.942
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

33:49.108 --> 33:52.067
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

33:52.233 --> 33:55.525
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

33:56.692 --> 33:58.025
All right.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.733
We're stuck here overnight.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.192
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.358
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

34:05.525 --> 34:07.192
- I am.
- Where do we stand with that?

34:07.358 --> 34:09.525
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

34:09.733 --> 34:11.775
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

34:11.942 --> 34:14.192
Other side wants to talk,
they can call New York.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.442
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

34:17.608 --> 34:20.692
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

34:21.067 --> 34:22.650
Find it.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.942
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

34:33.108 --> 34:37.525
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

34:37.692 --> 34:40.942
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a...</i>

34:41.317 --> 34:43.192
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

34:43.358 --> 34:47.900
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

34:48.067 --> 34:51.483
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.650
They don't know why or anything.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.983
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

34:57.150 --> 34:59.025
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

34:59.192 --> 35:00.400
That's the chapter.

35:00.567 --> 35:03.525
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

35:03.733 --> 35:05.025
<i>That's the title.</i>

35:05.192 --> 35:10.858
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

35:11.025 --> 35:12.983
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

35:13.525 --> 35:15.442
They all think it's just them.

35:15.608 --> 35:19.650
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

35:19.858 --> 35:21.983
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

35:22.150 --> 35:25.650
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

35:25.817 --> 35:29.442
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

35:30.650 --> 35:35.317
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

35:35.483 --> 35:37.275
...to hear it?

35:37.442 --> 35:39.358
Yeah. But later they will.

35:39.525 --> 35:42.358
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.775
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

35:45.942 --> 35:47.900
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

35:48.067 --> 35:51.358
<i>- Who?
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

35:51.525 --> 35:54.192
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Henry, it's after 11.</i>

35:54.358 --> 35:56.150
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

35:56.317 --> 36:00.317
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.150
<i>The book is Realm and Conquest.</i>

36:03.317 --> 36:05.067
Realm and Conquest.

36:05.233 --> 36:08.317
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

36:08.483 --> 36:11.025
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

36:11.900 --> 36:16.317
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

36:20.525 --> 36:23.942
<i>Realm and Conquest. Thank you.</i>

36:47.150 --> 36:49.150
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

36:49.358 --> 36:50.817
- You're late.
- I know.

36:50.983 --> 36:53.483
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

36:53.692 --> 36:55.358
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

36:55.567 --> 36:57.692
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.150
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

37:00.650 --> 37:03.650
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

37:03.858 --> 37:05.775
...then it's just a matter of time.

37:05.942 --> 37:08.692
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

37:08.983 --> 37:11.442
What happened after is worse.

37:11.608 --> 37:15.525
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.817
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

37:17.983 --> 37:21.650
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

37:21.817 --> 37:24.608
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

37:24.775 --> 37:26.358
What does this mean?

37:26.775 --> 37:28.317
I'm not sure.

37:28.525 --> 37:31.150
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

37:31.317 --> 37:33.108
He wasn't really making much sense.

37:33.275 --> 37:34.817
This is totally unacceptable.

37:35.025 --> 37:37.942
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

37:38.108 --> 37:40.025
In the morning, I have to call my board.

37:40.233 --> 37:44.775
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

37:44.942 --> 37:49.108
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

37:49.275 --> 37:51.067
I understand.

37:52.150 --> 37:54.150
What sickness is he talking about?

37:54.358 --> 37:56.983
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.442
Frostbite.

37:58.942 --> 38:00.567
You think this is funny?

38:00.733 --> 38:03.025
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

38:03.192 --> 38:07.650
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

38:07.817 --> 38:10.525
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

38:10.692 --> 38:13.358
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

38:14.067 --> 38:16.608
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

38:16.775 --> 38:19.608
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

38:19.775 --> 38:23.525
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

38:23.733 --> 38:26.692
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

38:26.900 --> 38:29.525
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

38:29.733 --> 38:32.483
...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

38:32.650 --> 38:34.650
I thought you wanted an explanation.

38:34.858 --> 38:37.567
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.775
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.733
He was mostly just quiet.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.775
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

38:51.942 --> 38:54.442
- He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?

38:54.608 --> 38:56.358
A super job, Elston.

38:56.525 --> 39:00.192
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

39:00.358 --> 39:01.775
I'll do that for sure.

39:22.150 --> 39:23.775
Did you see her?

39:24.108 --> 39:26.275
- Who?
- Anna.

39:26.817 --> 39:28.192
No.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.942
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

39:33.817 --> 39:35.483
Well, we need her.

39:37.317 --> 39:42.108
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

39:43.192 --> 39:46.692
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.608
No, they're lost.

39:50.775 --> 39:53.817
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.858
This what you wanted?

39:57.442 --> 39:58.942
To be a janitor?

39:59.400 --> 40:02.483
Live like this? All this?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.942
Do what you do?

40:05.858 --> 40:07.733
It can't be.

40:08.608 --> 40:09.650
It's...

40:09.817 --> 40:13.442
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

40:14.067 --> 40:16.192
That's... That's how it feels.

40:17.150 --> 40:21.858
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

40:23.608 --> 40:25.442
Get some sleep.

40:41.317 --> 40:42.317
<i>Hello?</i>

40:42.525 --> 40:46.317
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

40:47.358 --> 40:48.692
<i>You have a number?</i>

40:48.858 --> 40:51.942
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

40:52.108 --> 40:53.983
<i>No. The account number.</i>

40:54.150 --> 40:58.358
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

41:00.275 --> 41:02.275
Excuse me one moment.

41:02.733 --> 41:06.358
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

41:06.525 --> 41:08.567
12-BKR-6.

41:10.025 --> 41:11.983
Am I speaking with Verne?

41:13.108 --> 41:14.400
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

41:14.567 --> 41:17.900
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

41:18.067 --> 41:20.067
Don said that I could...

41:21.775 --> 41:24.025
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.150
<i>Do you have e-mail
at your current location?</i>

41:26.358 --> 41:27.567
I do.

41:27.733 --> 41:29.900
<i>- Are you alone?
- I am.</i>

41:30.692 --> 41:34.900
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

41:35.067 --> 41:36.483
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

41:36.650 --> 41:37.942
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

41:38.108 --> 41:41.067
<i>But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

41:41.233 --> 41:42.942
Okay. Thank you.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.858
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

42:10.025 --> 42:12.858
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

42:13.025 --> 42:15.692
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.

42:15.858 --> 42:18.817
Is the lease worth anything?

42:22.317 --> 42:24.817
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...

42:25.233 --> 42:27.983
The fixtures are gone, but there's...

42:29.692 --> 42:32.858
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

42:34.442 --> 42:35.983
But there's a...

42:40.317 --> 42:43.400
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

42:45.192 --> 42:47.275
Okay, yeah, I will.

42:47.900 --> 42:49.442
All right. Thanks.

42:59.775 --> 43:01.358
Come on, Arthur.

43:03.983 --> 43:05.275
Arthur!

43:06.733 --> 43:07.817
Arthur, open the door.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.275
Arthur, open the door!

43:16.108 --> 43:18.525
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

43:19.817 --> 43:21.067
Arthur, op...!

43:21.900 --> 43:23.983
Open the fucking door!

43:30.358 --> 43:31.817
Arthur!

43:32.608 --> 43:35.233
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!

43:45.692 --> 43:46.858
Arthur?!

43:58.192 --> 44:00.025
- Mr. Verne, hey.
- Hey, Danny.

44:00.192 --> 44:02.442
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

44:02.608 --> 44:05.483
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

44:05.650 --> 44:07.525
- We ready?
- Yep.

44:11.692 --> 44:13.733
For chrissake.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.775
Don Jeffries signed this?

44:16.233 --> 44:18.817
That's really his signature?

44:18.983 --> 44:20.942
Where's the original?

44:21.108 --> 44:26.150
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

44:32.275 --> 44:35.150
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

44:35.775 --> 44:37.317
Well, I don't know, Marty.

44:37.483 --> 44:41.442
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

44:46.192 --> 44:47.775
What are we looking for?

44:47.942 --> 44:52.150
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.108
What a mess this is.

44:59.733 --> 45:00.983
I want all this...

45:01.900 --> 45:06.025
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

45:07.108 --> 45:08.525
Any luck, Michael?

45:09.233 --> 45:13.358
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

45:13.525 --> 45:15.483
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

45:15.650 --> 45:16.858
Did you try his apartment?

45:17.025 --> 45:18.192
- He moved.
- I know.

45:18.358 --> 45:20.692
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

45:20.900 --> 45:23.525
- I called, I got the machine.
- So he could be anywhere.

45:23.733 --> 45:26.692
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.608
- Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, India.

45:29.775 --> 45:32.900
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

45:33.067 --> 45:34.900
Barry's taking over on U/North.

45:35.067 --> 45:36.858
We got a lot of groveling to do.

45:37.025 --> 45:39.150
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

45:39.317 --> 45:40.525
I was punting.

45:40.733 --> 45:43.358
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.

45:43.567 --> 45:44.525
Saddle up?

45:44.733 --> 45:47.775
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

45:47.942 --> 45:50.275
- Where?
- Does that really matter?

45:50.442 --> 45:53.358
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

45:53.525 --> 45:56.858
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

45:57.025 --> 45:59.233
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why the hell not?

45:59.400 --> 46:03.192
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.942
Did you see this fucking tape?

46:05.108 --> 46:07.817
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

46:07.983 --> 46:11.108
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

46:11.275 --> 46:14.775
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

46:14.942 --> 46:17.608
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

46:29.233 --> 46:31.275
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

46:32.442 --> 46:36.108
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

46:36.275 --> 46:38.442
Every five minutes, copy that.

47:14.525 --> 47:16.608
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

47:16.775 --> 47:20.025
<i>If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.</i>

47:21.192 --> 47:23.442
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

47:23.608 --> 47:28.025
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.</i>

47:29.858 --> 47:32.817
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

47:33.608 --> 47:36.692
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.942
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.

47:39.108 --> 47:40.567
But you gotta call me back.

47:40.733 --> 47:43.150
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

47:43.483 --> 47:45.400
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

47:45.567 --> 47:48.567
<i>Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

47:48.733 --> 47:51.108
<i>And there's a chemical part.
We both know it.</i>

47:51.483 --> 47:53.483
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

47:53.692 --> 47:56.817
<i>... then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

47:56.983 --> 48:00.442
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

48:00.608 --> 48:03.192
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

48:03.358 --> 48:05.025
You're right about what we are.

48:05.733 --> 48:09.192
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.</i>

48:09.358 --> 48:10.942
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

48:11.108 --> 48:14.567
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

48:16.525 --> 48:18.442
But we came to this, Arthur.

48:19.358 --> 48:22.442
<i>We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.</i>

48:22.608 --> 48:26.692
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

48:27.650 --> 48:29.442
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

48:31.067 --> 48:33.192
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

48:33.358 --> 48:35.692
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

48:35.900 --> 48:38.608
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

48:38.775 --> 48:42.983
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

48:43.150 --> 48:45.567
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

48:45.733 --> 48:49.733
<i>Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

49:50.192 --> 49:52.650
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

49:52.817 --> 49:54.192
Hang on.

49:57.567 --> 49:59.108
<i>Anna!</i>

50:01.108 --> 50:03.192
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

50:05.817 --> 50:07.525
<i>- Anna!
- Anna!</i>

50:08.483 --> 50:10.775
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

50:13.400 --> 50:15.483
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

50:26.900 --> 50:27.983
Hello?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.567
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

50:30.733 --> 50:33.317
<i>- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?</i>

50:33.733 --> 50:35.317
<i>I guess.</i>

50:35.483 --> 50:37.442
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

50:37.608 --> 50:40.233
<i>- Yeah.
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

50:40.400 --> 50:44.942
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

50:45.108 --> 50:47.817
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

50:47.983 --> 50:50.358
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

50:51.525 --> 50:55.317
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

50:56.150 --> 50:58.275
Why are you choosing me?

50:59.567 --> 51:01.942
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

51:02.108 --> 51:03.650
<i>That's for sure.</i>

51:03.858 --> 51:05.817
I mean, does it...?
Does it really matter?

51:05.983 --> 51:10.150
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're...</i>

51:10.317 --> 51:11.608
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

51:11.775 --> 51:15.442
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

51:15.608 --> 51:17.608
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

51:17.775 --> 51:19.442
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

51:19.608 --> 51:22.358
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

51:22.525 --> 51:23.942
That guy?

51:24.108 --> 51:27.608
Same guy. Same guy.

51:28.233 --> 51:29.608
Sorry.

51:30.650 --> 51:34.942
No. That's... That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

51:35.108 --> 51:37.817
<i>She can't believe I can do anything
on my own.</i>

51:37.983 --> 51:39.442
Well, that'll change.

51:40.192 --> 51:41.483
<i>I guess.</i>

51:41.650 --> 51:44.650
<i>Yeah, but, see,
that's something we can show her.</i>

51:44.858 --> 51:47.983
<i>That you can do something.</i>

51:48.150 --> 51:51.275
<i>That we could... We could do that together
if you want. I mean...</i>

51:51.442 --> 51:53.692
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

51:54.650 --> 51:57.275
I can get you 12 by Monday.

51:57.442 --> 51:59.483
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

51:59.692 --> 52:01.150
How do you figure that?

52:01.317 --> 52:04.858
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

52:05.025 --> 52:07.150
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

52:07.317 --> 52:10.233
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.650
What's the car worth?

52:11.817 --> 52:14.025
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

52:14.192 --> 52:18.067
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

52:18.233 --> 52:20.858
I can't. I did that three months ago.

52:21.817 --> 52:23.525
Are you back at the tables?

52:23.692 --> 52:26.608
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

52:29.775 --> 52:31.817
I hope you're kidding.

52:31.983 --> 52:36.025
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

52:37.650 --> 52:39.650
Do everyone a favor.

52:39.858 --> 52:44.233
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

52:45.025 --> 52:46.483
You got a week.

52:47.858 --> 52:50.650
- Hey, Michael. How are you?
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

52:50.817 --> 52:54.108
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

52:54.275 --> 52:56.317
I am trying to get him out
in 15 minutes.

52:56.483 --> 52:58.900
- Is he upstairs?
- He's taken over the living room.

52:59.067 --> 53:00.983
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

53:01.150 --> 53:05.900
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.900
Marty?

53:24.150 --> 53:27.025
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

53:27.692 --> 53:30.525
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

53:30.692 --> 53:32.567
...he's building a case against U/North.

53:32.733 --> 53:34.733
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?

53:34.900 --> 53:36.317
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

53:36.858 --> 53:39.525
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

53:39.692 --> 53:43.858
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

53:44.025 --> 53:46.983
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

53:47.150 --> 53:50.692
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.400
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

53:53.983 --> 53:55.775
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

53:55.942 --> 53:59.483
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

53:59.650 --> 54:03.358
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.442
Listen, Marty...

54:07.400 --> 54:09.733
...I'm in a bind here.

54:10.900 --> 54:13.650
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

54:14.817 --> 54:17.150
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

54:17.317 --> 54:20.150
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

54:20.317 --> 54:21.900
Eighty thousand.

54:22.067 --> 54:23.525
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

54:23.692 --> 54:26.483
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

54:27.233 --> 54:30.525
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

54:30.942 --> 54:32.650
There's nothing final on the merger.

54:32.817 --> 54:35.733
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

54:35.900 --> 54:38.567
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

54:38.733 --> 54:40.650
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

54:40.817 --> 54:43.858
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

54:44.025 --> 54:45.692
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.567
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

54:48.733 --> 54:50.317
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

54:50.525 --> 54:52.525
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

54:52.692 --> 54:55.275
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

54:55.442 --> 54:57.108
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

54:57.275 --> 55:00.317
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

55:00.483 --> 55:02.150
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.

55:02.317 --> 55:03.525
You think that's special?

55:03.692 --> 55:06.358
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

55:06.858 --> 55:10.192
At this, what you do, you're great.

55:10.358 --> 55:14.650
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

55:14.817 --> 55:17.817
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

55:17.983 --> 55:22.025
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

55:22.192 --> 55:25.608
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

55:25.775 --> 55:29.775
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

55:30.650 --> 55:33.150
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

55:33.733 --> 55:37.025
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

55:37.192 --> 55:38.817
- I never said that.
- No?

55:38.983 --> 55:40.317
Maybe you should have.

55:40.483 --> 55:45.150
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

55:45.317 --> 55:48.483
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

55:48.650 --> 55:50.775
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

55:51.567 --> 55:54.900
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

55:55.275 --> 55:59.233
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

55:59.400 --> 56:02.983
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

56:03.150 --> 56:04.442
Jesus, Marty.

56:04.692 --> 56:06.108
Hey.

56:06.275 --> 56:08.317
When did you get so fucking delicate?

56:09.400 --> 56:10.983
I'm late.

56:50.567 --> 56:53.650
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

56:53.817 --> 56:55.817
It's not that kind of a problem.

56:57.483 --> 56:59.858
- How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

57:11.858 --> 57:15.692
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

57:15.858 --> 57:18.983
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

57:26.358 --> 57:29.317
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

57:29.525 --> 57:32.275
- What?
- I wanna go home.

57:32.442 --> 57:34.233
Come on, Henry.

57:37.650 --> 57:38.650
Hold up!

57:41.692 --> 57:43.525
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

57:45.192 --> 57:48.150
Arthur! Arthur!

57:48.317 --> 57:49.650
Wait up.

57:50.483 --> 57:53.858
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

57:55.275 --> 57:58.025
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

57:58.858 --> 58:01.483
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

58:01.650 --> 58:05.233
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's... It's still warm.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.025
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

58:11.067 --> 58:12.817
So welcome home.

58:13.983 --> 58:16.900
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

58:17.067 --> 58:19.442
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

58:19.608 --> 58:21.442
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

58:21.608 --> 58:24.108
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

58:24.275 --> 58:27.525
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

58:27.692 --> 58:31.275
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

58:31.900 --> 58:33.317
And how's that going?

58:33.483 --> 58:35.942
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

58:36.233 --> 58:41.650
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

58:41.817 --> 58:43.108
That's my goal.

58:43.275 --> 58:46.650
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

58:46.817 --> 58:48.192
No. No. You're wrong.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.483
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

58:52.650 --> 58:55.817
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

58:55.983 --> 59:00.483
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

59:00.692 --> 59:04.442
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

59:04.608 --> 59:07.358
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

59:07.817 --> 59:11.775
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

59:11.942 --> 59:13.192
You got great cards here.

59:13.358 --> 59:16.692
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

59:16.858 --> 59:20.067
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

59:20.233 --> 59:22.942
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

59:23.108 --> 59:24.858
...and you've got
your arms around it.

59:25.025 --> 59:28.358
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

59:28.525 --> 59:31.067
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

59:31.233 --> 59:34.525
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

59:34.692 --> 59:38.150
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

59:38.358 --> 59:41.567
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

59:41.733 --> 59:45.983
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

59:46.150 --> 59:48.025
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

59:48.192 --> 59:50.692
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

59:50.858 --> 59:54.358
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

59:54.525 --> 59:56.692
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

59:56.858 --> 1:00:00.650
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

1:00:04.358 --> 1:00:06.275
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

1:00:06.442 --> 1:00:08.317
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

1:00:08.483 --> 1:00:13.358
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

1:00:13.525 --> 1:00:16.358
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

1:00:16.525 --> 1:00:18.358
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

1:00:18.525 --> 1:00:21.525
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

1:00:23.025 --> 1:00:27.317
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

1:00:27.483 --> 1:00:28.983
I'll help you think this through.

1:00:29.192 --> 1:00:31.400
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

1:00:32.067 --> 1:00:35.733
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:40.567
Michael, I have great affection for you.

1:00:40.733 --> 1:00:45.025
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

1:00:45.650 --> 1:00:47.483
If you wanted to have me committed...

1:00:47.650 --> 1:00:51.525
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

1:00:51.692 --> 1:00:54.317
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

1:00:54.525 --> 1:00:56.483
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

1:00:56.650 --> 1:00:59.025
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

1:00:59.483 --> 1:01:04.733
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:08.275
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

1:01:08.442 --> 1:01:11.150
You think you got the horses for that?

1:01:11.317 --> 1:01:14.025
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

1:01:15.317 --> 1:01:19.442
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

1:01:20.275 --> 1:01:22.108
I'm not the enemy.

1:01:22.608 --> 1:01:24.650
Then who are you?

1:01:37.275 --> 1:01:39.192
<i>We find the seed.</i>

1:01:43.192 --> 1:01:45.275
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

1:01:48.192 --> 1:01:50.317
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

1:01:52.483 --> 1:01:54.400
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

1:02:06.150 --> 1:02:07.858
<i>We find the seed.</i>

1:02:11.983 --> 1:02:13.858
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

1:02:17.108 --> 1:02:19.067
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

1:02:21.275 --> 1:02:22.525
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

1:02:40.775 --> 1:02:42.567
What the hell is he doing?

1:03:00.108 --> 1:03:01.858
<i>We find the seed.</i>

1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:07.150
<i>You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

1:03:07.317 --> 1:03:09.192
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

1:03:09.983 --> 1:03:11.150
Yes!

1:03:11.483 --> 1:03:15.358
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

1:03:15.525 --> 1:03:18.942
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.</i>

1:03:19.108 --> 1:03:22.650
<i>So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...</i>

1:03:22.817 --> 1:03:28.067
<i>... for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.</i>

1:03:28.233 --> 1:03:31.525
<i>June 19th, 1991.</i>

1:03:31.775 --> 1:03:33.400
"Conclusion:

1:03:33.567 --> 1:03:36.233
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:41.650
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

1:03:42.525 --> 1:03:45.483
<i>Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?</i>

1:03:45.650 --> 1:03:48.525
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

1:03:48.692 --> 1:03:51.775
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

1:03:51.942 --> 1:03:53.775
Okay? Okay.

1:03:53.942 --> 1:03:56.358
<i>"In-house field studies
have indicated...</i>

1:03:56.525 --> 1:04:01.275
<i>... that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...</i>

1:04:01.442 --> 1:04:05.608
<i>... are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...</i>

1:04:05.775 --> 1:04:09.692
...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

1:04:09.858 --> 1:04:12.233
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:15.733
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

1:04:15.900 --> 1:04:17.983
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

1:04:18.525 --> 1:04:21.275
<i>- "Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.</i>

1:04:21.442 --> 1:04:24.358
<i>... that it is tasteless, colorless
and does not precipitate...</i>

1:04:24.525 --> 1:04:27.150
<i>... has the potential
to mask and intensify...</i>

1:04:27.358 --> 1:04:29.900
...these potentially lethal exposures."

1:04:30.067 --> 1:04:31.858
Now, I love this.

1:04:32.025 --> 1:04:33.942
Not only is this a great product...

1:04:34.108 --> 1:04:37.817
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

1:04:37.983 --> 1:04:40.692
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

1:04:40.858 --> 1:04:45.067
<i>... the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...</i>

1:04:45.233 --> 1:04:50.108
<i>... would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.</i>

1:04:50.358 --> 1:04:53.358
<i>These costs,
while assumed to be significant...</i>

1:04:53.525 --> 1:04:55.358
<i>... were not summarized here."</i>

1:04:55.525 --> 1:04:57.442
Which, loosely translated, means:

1:04:57.608 --> 1:05:01.650
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

1:05:01.858 --> 1:05:04.983
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

1:05:05.275 --> 1:05:08.817
<i>"Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...</i>

1:05:09.025 --> 1:05:11.692
<i>... would compromise
the effective marketing of Culcitate...</i>

1:05:12.358 --> 1:05:15.567
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

1:05:15.733 --> 1:05:18.817
...of United-Northfield's
trade secret language."

1:05:20.150 --> 1:05:24.733
<i>You don't need me
to tell you what that means.</i>

1:05:25.025 --> 1:05:26.317
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1:05:30.025 --> 1:05:32.525
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

1:05:34.358 --> 1:05:35.983
You have to contain this.

1:05:37.692 --> 1:05:39.942
- Contain?
- Right.

1:05:40.483 --> 1:05:42.525
Well, that's my question.

1:05:43.317 --> 1:05:47.650
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

1:05:47.817 --> 1:05:49.650
Along those lines.

1:05:49.817 --> 1:05:52.817
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

1:05:53.733 --> 1:05:58.192
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

1:05:58.358 --> 1:06:00.192
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

1:06:00.942 --> 1:06:02.900
We deal in absolutes.

1:06:03.067 --> 1:06:05.983
Okay. I understand that. I do.

1:06:06.150 --> 1:06:11.567
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

1:06:11.733 --> 1:06:13.567
Well, the other way?

1:06:15.608 --> 1:06:17.483
Is the other way.

1:06:21.358 --> 1:06:23.858
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

1:06:24.025 --> 1:06:27.525
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

1:06:34.483 --> 1:06:36.275
Do you think it's doable?

1:06:37.733 --> 1:06:41.025
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

1:06:41.192 --> 1:06:44.275
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...

1:06:44.442 --> 1:06:45.775
Okay.

1:06:49.817 --> 1:06:53.317
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

1:06:57.025 --> 1:06:59.858
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

1:07:00.025 --> 1:07:03.150
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

1:07:03.317 --> 1:07:05.483
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
- Come on.

1:07:05.692 --> 1:07:08.108
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:10.858
Come on.

1:07:11.025 --> 1:07:12.650
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1:07:12.858 --> 1:07:14.775
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1:07:15.567 --> 1:07:18.233
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:20.358
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1:07:22.775 --> 1:07:24.650
All right, Eddie.

1:07:24.817 --> 1:07:28.108
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1:07:28.275 --> 1:07:29.692
Happy birthday.

1:07:29.858 --> 1:07:31.650
You have time for cake?

1:07:32.150 --> 1:07:34.400
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1:07:34.567 --> 1:07:35.567
You going in?

1:07:37.317 --> 1:07:39.483
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

1:07:39.650 --> 1:07:41.025
You're not both running out?

1:07:41.192 --> 1:07:42.983
I got a situation.

1:07:43.150 --> 1:07:44.817
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

1:07:44.983 --> 1:07:47.358
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

1:07:47.525 --> 1:07:50.483
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1:07:50.650 --> 1:07:53.567
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

1:07:53.733 --> 1:07:56.108
Good. You can drive him home.

1:07:56.275 --> 1:07:57.692
Just stay for an hour.

1:07:58.275 --> 1:08:00.067
The girls did all this stuff.

1:08:00.983 --> 1:08:02.358
He'll be asleep by then.

1:08:06.233 --> 1:08:08.317
Timmy's been calling me.

1:08:12.317 --> 1:08:13.817
He's afraid to talk to you.

1:08:14.025 --> 1:08:15.150
He should be.

1:08:15.317 --> 1:08:17.900
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?

1:08:18.067 --> 1:08:20.025
The kids are freaking out.

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:21.775
The in-laws are freaking out.

1:08:22.733 --> 1:08:25.775
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

1:08:25.942 --> 1:08:29.608
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1:08:29.775 --> 1:08:32.400
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1:08:32.567 --> 1:08:36.275
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1:08:36.442 --> 1:08:37.483
I got my hands full.

1:08:37.942 --> 1:08:41.358
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1:08:42.650 --> 1:08:44.650
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1:08:45.858 --> 1:08:49.067
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

1:08:49.233 --> 1:08:53.525
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1:08:54.567 --> 1:08:56.275
Is that pointed at me?

1:08:58.567 --> 1:09:01.317
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1:09:01.483 --> 1:09:03.858
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1:09:04.025 --> 1:09:06.483
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

1:09:06.692 --> 1:09:09.733
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:11.483
That was my big play, all right?

1:09:11.650 --> 1:09:15.483
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1:09:15.650 --> 1:09:18.233
Okay. Okay.

1:09:19.275 --> 1:09:21.233
Cool down. I hear you.

1:09:26.150 --> 1:09:28.192
I'd be pissed off too.

1:09:34.483 --> 1:09:36.108
Just hang for an hour.

1:09:37.025 --> 1:09:39.067
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1:10:13.358 --> 1:10:15.733
Ready? And, lift.

1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:18.233
Ready and go.

1:10:42.192 --> 1:10:43.233
Wipe.

1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:54.317
You better hit it.

1:11:27.858 --> 1:11:29.192
We're good.

1:12:03.525 --> 1:12:06.650
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1:12:06.817 --> 1:12:08.817
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1:12:09.025 --> 1:12:10.942
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1:12:11.108 --> 1:12:14.192
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...

1:12:14.358 --> 1:12:16.233
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:18.650
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1:12:18.858 --> 1:12:21.442
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

1:12:21.608 --> 1:12:23.608
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

1:12:23.775 --> 1:12:25.983
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

1:12:26.192 --> 1:12:27.858
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:40.275
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?

1:12:40.442 --> 1:12:41.775
Henry, get in the car.

1:12:44.442 --> 1:12:45.858
Good to see you, Hen.

1:12:47.775 --> 1:12:50.525
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

1:12:51.525 --> 1:12:55.192
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1:12:55.358 --> 1:12:56.983
In front of the kid?

1:12:57.192 --> 1:13:00.650
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1:13:01.692 --> 1:13:05.275
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1:13:05.775 --> 1:13:08.067
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1:13:09.192 --> 1:13:11.692
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1:13:16.983 --> 1:13:19.942
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

1:13:20.108 --> 1:13:21.942
Because of drugs, right?

1:13:22.108 --> 1:13:23.900
That and everything else.

1:13:55.233 --> 1:13:56.692
What?

1:13:58.983 --> 1:14:00.358
Your Uncle Timmy...

1:14:01.025 --> 1:14:06.483
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1:14:07.525 --> 1:14:10.692
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1:14:10.858 --> 1:14:13.983
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1:14:15.025 --> 1:14:18.900
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1:14:19.067 --> 1:14:21.275
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1:14:21.442 --> 1:14:23.233
But when you see him like that...

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:26.150
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1:14:26.358 --> 1:14:28.900
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

1:14:29.067 --> 1:14:32.650
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1:14:32.858 --> 1:14:35.233
I know that. I know it.

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:36.692
Okay?

1:14:40.942 --> 1:14:45.108
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:50.150
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1:14:51.858 --> 1:14:53.192
Okay?

1:15:06.358 --> 1:15:07.692
Hello?

1:15:17.692 --> 1:15:21.567
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1:15:21.733 --> 1:15:26.358
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1:15:26.692 --> 1:15:32.025
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1:15:32.192 --> 1:15:36.525
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1:15:37.525 --> 1:15:40.442
There's pills all over the place.

1:15:41.233 --> 1:15:46.317
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1:15:47.025 --> 1:15:49.400
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1:15:49.567 --> 1:15:53.150
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so...

1:15:55.525 --> 1:15:58.650
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

1:15:59.233 --> 1:16:03.817
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1:16:04.858 --> 1:16:06.150
Can I get in there?

1:16:06.358 --> 1:16:09.358
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1:16:10.067 --> 1:16:14.233
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:17.525
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1:16:18.192 --> 1:16:21.233
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:25.108
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1:16:25.525 --> 1:16:26.900
Sorry.

1:16:28.942 --> 1:16:30.400
Sure.

1:16:36.692 --> 1:16:37.650
Okay.

1:16:41.900 --> 1:16:46.483
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1:16:48.150 --> 1:16:49.317
I'll tell him hello.

1:16:49.483 --> 1:16:51.483
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

1:16:52.358 --> 1:16:53.733
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:55.692
I'm sorry for your loss.

1:17:14.192 --> 1:17:16.775
- Michael.
- Jeff.

1:17:16.942 --> 1:17:18.400
This is tough.

1:17:18.567 --> 1:17:20.150
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1:17:31.692 --> 1:17:33.900
Dumb son of a bitch.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:35.525
What a thing.

1:17:35.692 --> 1:17:37.942
- Hold on.
- I don't even know...

1:17:38.108 --> 1:17:40.025
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.

1:17:40.192 --> 1:17:43.400
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1:17:43.567 --> 1:17:47.025
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1:17:47.567 --> 1:17:50.567
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1:17:51.233 --> 1:17:53.067
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1:17:53.233 --> 1:17:54.775
Go. Go.

1:17:55.525 --> 1:17:56.858
You okay?

1:17:57.567 --> 1:17:59.317
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:18:00.608 --> 1:18:02.650
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1:18:05.525 --> 1:18:09.733
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:11.150
Not a chance.

1:18:11.317 --> 1:18:13.108
I just couldn't get through to him.

1:18:13.275 --> 1:18:16.442
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:20.525
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1:18:22.567 --> 1:18:24.442
It's gotta be an accident.

1:18:24.608 --> 1:18:26.150
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1:18:26.358 --> 1:18:29.317
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1:18:29.483 --> 1:18:31.733
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:34.150
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1:18:34.317 --> 1:18:37.317
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1:18:37.525 --> 1:18:38.900
Why?

1:18:40.358 --> 1:18:43.525
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:50.858
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1:18:51.358 --> 1:18:52.983
Good years.

1:18:54.525 --> 1:18:58.692
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1:19:01.525 --> 1:19:04.025
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1:19:05.192 --> 1:19:06.817
You can say it.

1:19:09.358 --> 1:19:11.275
We caught a lucky break.

1:19:14.275 --> 1:19:16.567
We did, didn't we?

1:19:21.275 --> 1:19:24.692
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1:19:24.858 --> 1:19:26.608
- They accepted?
- In principle.

1:19:26.775 --> 1:19:29.608
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1:19:29.775 --> 1:19:32.692
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1:19:32.858 --> 1:19:34.733
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:38.983
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1:19:40.692 --> 1:19:43.817
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1:19:45.233 --> 1:19:46.567
It's...

1:19:46.733 --> 1:19:48.400
It's what we got.

1:19:49.525 --> 1:19:52.358
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

1:20:25.150 --> 1:20:26.150
Hello.

1:20:26.317 --> 1:20:28.900
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1:20:29.067 --> 1:20:30.150
<i>Who is this?</i>

1:20:30.358 --> 1:20:33.817
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1:20:34.025 --> 1:20:36.858
<i>- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?</i>

1:20:37.025 --> 1:20:40.858
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1:20:41.233 --> 1:20:42.817
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1:20:43.025 --> 1:20:45.858
<i>This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1:20:46.025 --> 1:20:47.983
<i>- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.</i>

1:20:48.192 --> 1:20:52.400
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again...

1:20:52.567 --> 1:20:54.858
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

1:20:55.358 --> 1:20:57.317
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1:20:57.525 --> 1:20:59.942
She's in the city right now?

1:21:00.108 --> 1:21:01.650
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1:21:01.858 --> 1:21:04.858
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1:21:37.525 --> 1:21:38.775
<i>Anna.</i>

1:21:41.192 --> 1:21:42.650
Anna?

1:21:43.483 --> 1:21:46.442
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1:21:46.608 --> 1:21:49.275
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1:21:50.567 --> 1:21:52.442
Please open the door, Anna.

1:22:03.733 --> 1:22:05.442
What are you thinking?

1:22:06.233 --> 1:22:11.525
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1:22:14.358 --> 1:22:17.650
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1:22:19.525 --> 1:22:23.358
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1:22:23.525 --> 1:22:25.858
...and show me, and I would see...

1:22:26.858 --> 1:22:29.692
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:34.775
Even this morning...

1:22:34.942 --> 1:22:36.525
...I mean, I thought:

1:22:38.067 --> 1:22:42.733
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1:22:42.900 --> 1:22:47.983
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1:22:50.608 --> 1:22:55.442
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

1:22:55.608 --> 1:22:58.275
...for a first-class ticket.

1:22:58.442 --> 1:22:59.900
And I just...

1:23:03.858 --> 1:23:05.775
I got on the plane.

1:23:08.525 --> 1:23:10.483
I believed him.

1:23:15.233 --> 1:23:19.900
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1:23:20.733 --> 1:23:24.733
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1:23:24.900 --> 1:23:28.358
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1:23:29.442 --> 1:23:32.358
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.

1:23:32.525 --> 1:23:34.067
No.

1:23:35.233 --> 1:23:37.400
He made me promise.

1:23:38.900 --> 1:23:43.275
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:45.817
No.

1:23:50.567 --> 1:23:53.525
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1:24:06.233 --> 1:24:09.108
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

1:24:10.608 --> 1:24:12.275
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

1:24:13.192 --> 1:24:16.275
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1:24:16.442 --> 1:24:18.608
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1:24:19.983 --> 1:24:22.400
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

1:24:22.567 --> 1:24:25.192
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1:24:25.358 --> 1:24:27.858
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1:24:28.025 --> 1:24:29.650
You really wanna know?

1:25:46.900 --> 1:25:49.150
This just gets better and better.

1:25:50.775 --> 1:25:52.358
What are we doing?

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:54.942
Freeze!

1:27:55.108 --> 1:27:57.817
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1:27:58.025 --> 1:28:00.275
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!

1:28:00.442 --> 1:28:02.983
Get your hands up now! Now!

1:28:03.150 --> 1:28:05.067
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.

1:28:05.233 --> 1:28:08.108
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1:28:08.275 --> 1:28:11.567
- Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

1:28:11.733 --> 1:28:13.567
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1:28:13.733 --> 1:28:16.192
- I said, who else is here?
- Nobody's here!

1:28:16.358 --> 1:28:17.733
Check in there.

1:28:18.525 --> 1:28:21.817
You move, I'll take your head off.

1:28:51.692 --> 1:28:56.108
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1:28:56.275 --> 1:28:58.358
- Now I owe them both my balls.
- I'm sorry.

1:28:58.525 --> 1:29:00.525
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

1:29:00.692 --> 1:29:03.775
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1:29:03.942 --> 1:29:05.317
It's bad. I know it.

1:29:05.483 --> 1:29:08.525
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1:29:08.692 --> 1:29:10.692
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

1:29:10.858 --> 1:29:13.192
- Who called 911?
- What?

1:29:13.525 --> 1:29:16.442
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1:29:16.608 --> 1:29:19.025
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you...?

1:29:19.192 --> 1:29:20.775
This never happened.

1:29:22.067 --> 1:29:24.108
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1:29:24.275 --> 1:29:26.317
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1:29:26.525 --> 1:29:30.650
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1:29:30.817 --> 1:29:32.900
You know exactly what you are.

1:29:46.525 --> 1:29:48.025
We tried calling you six times.

1:29:48.192 --> 1:29:50.317
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1:29:52.192 --> 1:29:53.650
We gave it our best shot.

1:29:55.025 --> 1:29:57.483
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1:29:57.692 --> 1:29:59.525
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1:30:20.942 --> 1:30:22.442
Is everything all right?

1:30:22.608 --> 1:30:23.817
It's fine, yeah.

1:30:24.525 --> 1:30:27.608
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...

1:30:27.775 --> 1:30:30.817
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1:30:31.025 --> 1:30:33.233
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1:30:33.400 --> 1:30:35.483
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1:30:56.025 --> 1:30:57.358
Hello.

1:31:02.442 --> 1:31:05.733
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1:31:06.317 --> 1:31:07.608
What?

1:31:15.025 --> 1:31:17.150
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1:31:17.358 --> 1:31:18.817
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1:31:19.025 --> 1:31:20.775
We have a situation.

1:31:40.525 --> 1:31:42.108
Hey, did they find you?

1:31:42.275 --> 1:31:45.317
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1:31:53.483 --> 1:31:54.817
Marty.

1:31:55.150 --> 1:31:58.317
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1:31:58.525 --> 1:32:00.483
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late...

1:32:00.692 --> 1:32:02.317
We never got to finish last night.

1:32:02.483 --> 1:32:04.608
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1:32:04.775 --> 1:32:07.817
- No, I left right after you left.
- If you say so.

1:32:08.025 --> 1:32:10.692
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1:32:10.858 --> 1:32:14.150
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1:32:14.317 --> 1:32:17.483
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1:32:17.692 --> 1:32:20.608
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1:32:20.775 --> 1:32:24.108
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1:32:24.275 --> 1:32:26.525
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1:32:27.025 --> 1:32:29.817
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1:32:30.358 --> 1:32:32.650
So we cut you a check this morning.

1:32:32.858 --> 1:32:36.150
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

1:32:36.317 --> 1:32:40.442
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1:32:44.192 --> 1:32:46.650
What if Arthur was on to something?

1:32:46.817 --> 1:32:48.483
What do you mean? On to what?

1:32:48.650 --> 1:32:51.525
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1:32:51.692 --> 1:32:53.817
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1:32:54.025 --> 1:32:56.442
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1:32:56.608 --> 1:32:59.525
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1:32:59.692 --> 1:33:01.692
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1:33:01.858 --> 1:33:04.608
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1:33:04.775 --> 1:33:08.192
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1:33:08.358 --> 1:33:10.775
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1:33:10.942 --> 1:33:12.983
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1:33:13.192 --> 1:33:16.150
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1:33:16.317 --> 1:33:18.025
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1:33:18.192 --> 1:33:21.858
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1:33:22.025 --> 1:33:24.692
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1:33:25.192 --> 1:33:26.858
That's 80.

1:33:27.358 --> 1:33:29.150
We're calling it a bonus.

1:33:30.025 --> 1:33:32.025
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1:33:32.192 --> 1:33:33.817
That's assuming this all works out.

1:33:34.025 --> 1:33:35.150
You're doing this now?

1:33:36.858 --> 1:33:40.150
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1:33:40.358 --> 1:33:43.192
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1:33:43.358 --> 1:33:45.483
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1:33:45.650 --> 1:33:47.358
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1:33:47.525 --> 1:33:51.317
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1:33:51.525 --> 1:33:54.067
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1:33:54.733 --> 1:33:57.442
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1:33:57.608 --> 1:34:00.275
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1:34:00.442 --> 1:34:03.025
- If I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

1:34:03.192 --> 1:34:04.442
So there you go.

1:34:04.608 --> 1:34:06.275
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1:34:07.150 --> 1:34:09.317
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1:34:09.692 --> 1:34:12.983
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1:34:13.608 --> 1:34:16.317
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

1:34:17.108 --> 1:34:21.192
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1:34:24.775 --> 1:34:26.150
You're welcome.

1:35:18.983 --> 1:35:21.358
You said 12. This is 75.

1:35:21.525 --> 1:35:23.650
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1:35:23.858 --> 1:35:25.692
No. I'm working.

1:35:28.150 --> 1:35:31.650
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1:35:31.858 --> 1:35:33.525
You're just doing your job.

1:35:33.692 --> 1:35:35.192
That's right.

1:35:36.108 --> 1:35:37.817
Take it easy, Gabe.

1:35:38.858 --> 1:35:40.192
Michael.

1:35:51.942 --> 1:35:53.358
<i>Check.</i>

1:35:55.192 --> 1:35:56.483
<i>Check.</i>

1:35:56.817 --> 1:35:59.525
- Check.
- Half the pot. Two hundred.

1:35:59.692 --> 1:36:00.983
Two hundred to go.

1:36:38.358 --> 1:36:40.108
So, what happened with the bar?

1:36:40.275 --> 1:36:42.317
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1:37:04.775 --> 1:37:07.525
What are you doing? You just got here.

1:37:07.692 --> 1:37:09.650
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1:37:09.817 --> 1:37:13.983
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1:37:49.692 --> 1:37:50.775
Get out.

1:37:52.150 --> 1:37:54.275
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1:37:56.025 --> 1:37:56.983
<i>- Walter?
- Michael.</i>

1:37:57.192 --> 1:37:59.358
<i>- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.</i>

1:38:03.775 --> 1:38:05.692
You have eight...

1:38:06.608 --> 1:38:09.317
<i>... six, five...</i>

1:38:09.525 --> 1:38:11.817
<i>... four, three...</i>

1:38:12.025 --> 1:38:13.650
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1:38:17.067 --> 1:38:20.108
<i>- Tell him to stay off the phone.
- All right. But you're on it?</i>

1:38:20.692 --> 1:38:22.150
Am I clean?

1:38:22.317 --> 1:38:23.525
Just keep walking.

1:38:23.692 --> 1:38:25.942
You copy. Am I clean?

1:38:26.150 --> 1:38:29.150
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1:38:29.692 --> 1:38:33.233
<i>- to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:35.858
<i>- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.</i>

1:38:39.525 --> 1:38:42.983
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1:39:11.108 --> 1:39:14.650
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...

1:39:16.442 --> 1:39:18.358
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1:39:25.942 --> 1:39:29.150
- I don't know what Walter promised you...
- A miracle worker!

1:39:29.317 --> 1:39:32.525
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1:39:32.692 --> 1:39:34.525
"Hang Tight. I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1:39:34.692 --> 1:39:36.358
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

1:39:36.525 --> 1:39:40.067
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1:39:45.858 --> 1:39:47.775
We're up. Just got a signal.

1:40:11.608 --> 1:40:13.983
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1:40:14.150 --> 1:40:15.317
Maybe he's lost.

1:40:15.525 --> 1:40:17.317
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.

1:40:20.650 --> 1:40:21.858
He was alone, right?

1:40:22.025 --> 1:40:24.817
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

1:40:27.275 --> 1:40:28.900
We gotta turn around.

1:40:59.108 --> 1:41:00.733
Talk to me.

1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:02.483
It's strobing.

1:41:02.650 --> 1:41:05.025
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1:41:20.858 --> 1:41:22.442
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1:41:22.608 --> 1:41:23.983
- Where?
- He took...

1:41:24.483 --> 1:41:26.442
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:39.358
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

1:41:39.525 --> 1:41:41.650
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

1:41:51.817 --> 1:41:54.483
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

1:41:54.692 --> 1:41:57.692
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1:42:04.567 --> 1:42:07.192
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1:42:07.358 --> 1:42:08.442
The signal or the grid?

1:42:08.608 --> 1:42:11.317
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

1:43:02.525 --> 1:43:03.983
Give me the cell.

1:43:06.525 --> 1:43:08.192
Our signal's good.

1:44:46.025 --> 1:44:47.275
What?

1:44:49.900 --> 1:44:51.608
Thanks, Mickey.

1:44:51.775 --> 1:44:53.442
Just get me out of here.

1:45:01.150 --> 1:45:04.858
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1:45:05.025 --> 1:45:08.650
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...

1:45:08.858 --> 1:45:10.317
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

1:45:10.525 --> 1:45:13.025
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
- No. Michael Clayton.

1:45:13.483 --> 1:45:14.525
What?

1:45:14.692 --> 1:45:17.608
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1:45:18.650 --> 1:45:19.650
What?

1:45:21.358 --> 1:45:23.150
Holy shit.

1:45:37.358 --> 1:45:42.275
<i>It has been and it remains
the U/North position...</i>

1:45:42.442 --> 1:45:46.525
<i>... that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.</i>

1:45:46.692 --> 1:45:50.775
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1:45:50.942 --> 1:45:56.108
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1:45:56.275 --> 1:45:58.817
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1:45:59.025 --> 1:46:02.442
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1:46:02.650 --> 1:46:06.525
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1:46:07.525 --> 1:46:11.942
<i>You all have
a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1:46:12.525 --> 1:46:16.483
<i>... which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:</i>

1:46:16.692 --> 1:46:19.442
<i>Over the past several months
we had gotten word...</i>

1:46:19.608 --> 1:46:22.942
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1:46:23.108 --> 1:46:26.942
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1:46:27.442 --> 1:46:28.900
<i>We also learned...</i>

1:46:29.067 --> 1:46:33.025
<i>... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1:46:33.192 --> 1:46:35.275
<i>... up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1:46:35.692 --> 1:46:39.942
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1:46:40.108 --> 1:46:44.650
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1:46:44.858 --> 1:46:46.150
...in the middle there.

1:46:46.942 --> 1:46:48.650
<i>Finally...</i>

1:46:48.817 --> 1:46:53.150
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1:46:53.317 --> 1:46:55.150
...and that the tax benefit...

1:46:55.317 --> 1:46:58.525
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1:46:58.692 --> 1:47:01.150
...and within this fiscal year...

1:47:01.317 --> 1:47:07.150
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1:47:07.692 --> 1:47:11.858
<i>The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...</i>

1:47:12.317 --> 1:47:17.108
<i>... the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.</i>

1:47:17.275 --> 1:47:18.983
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1:47:19.150 --> 1:47:22.400
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1:47:23.483 --> 1:47:26.983
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1:47:27.192 --> 1:47:29.442
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1:47:31.858 --> 1:47:32.817
Well...

1:47:55.942 --> 1:47:57.775
How'd it go in there?

1:48:00.817 --> 1:48:02.983
Pretty freaky, huh?

1:48:03.192 --> 1:48:06.150
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1:48:08.692 --> 1:48:11.942
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1:48:13.525 --> 1:48:17.192
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1:48:20.358 --> 1:48:21.858
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1:48:22.025 --> 1:48:24.150
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1:48:24.317 --> 1:48:25.650
What do you think I'm doing?

1:48:25.858 --> 1:48:27.650
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1:48:27.817 --> 1:48:30.483
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1:48:30.692 --> 1:48:34.317
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1:48:34.525 --> 1:48:36.692
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1:48:36.858 --> 1:48:40.150
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1:48:40.358 --> 1:48:41.650
I'm calling Marty.

1:48:41.858 --> 1:48:44.192
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1:48:44.358 --> 1:48:47.150
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1:48:47.358 --> 1:48:49.150
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1:48:49.358 --> 1:48:53.150
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1:48:53.317 --> 1:48:56.733
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1:48:56.900 --> 1:48:59.650
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1:48:59.858 --> 1:49:03.483
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1:49:03.692 --> 1:49:06.358
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1:49:06.525 --> 1:49:07.858
This conversation is over.

1:49:08.025 --> 1:49:11.483
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1:49:11.650 --> 1:49:14.150
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1:49:14.358 --> 1:49:17.817
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1:49:18.150 --> 1:49:21.275
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1:49:21.442 --> 1:49:24.858
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1:49:25.025 --> 1:49:26.900
...and you're gonna kill me?

1:49:27.858 --> 1:49:30.650
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1:49:30.858 --> 1:49:34.525
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1:49:34.692 --> 1:49:38.525
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1:49:40.025 --> 1:49:41.483
What do you want?

1:49:41.650 --> 1:49:43.150
What do I want?

1:49:43.358 --> 1:49:44.942
I want more.

1:49:45.442 --> 1:49:47.192
I want out.

1:49:47.358 --> 1:49:49.983
And with this, I want everything.

1:49:51.775 --> 1:49:52.983
Is there a number?

1:49:53.192 --> 1:49:54.775
Ten is a number.

1:49:54.942 --> 1:49:56.983
Ten? Ten what?

1:49:59.025 --> 1:50:00.483
Ten million?

1:50:00.692 --> 1:50:04.108
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1:50:04.692 --> 1:50:06.567
You know what's great about this?

1:50:06.733 --> 1:50:09.025
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1:50:09.608 --> 1:50:11.525
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1:50:11.692 --> 1:50:14.650
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1:50:16.525 --> 1:50:18.900
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1:50:19.067 --> 1:50:21.192
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1:50:21.358 --> 1:50:22.858
Where? My car?

1:50:24.442 --> 1:50:25.483
All right.

1:50:26.650 --> 1:50:29.650
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1:50:29.858 --> 1:50:31.650
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1:50:34.025 --> 1:50:38.775
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1:50:38.942 --> 1:50:42.650
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1:50:42.858 --> 1:50:44.942
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1:50:45.108 --> 1:50:47.483
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

1:50:47.650 --> 1:50:50.233
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:51.733
Karen?

1:50:52.442 --> 1:50:54.317
- One second.
- Everything okay?

1:50:55.692 --> 1:50:56.650
Yes.

1:50:57.692 --> 1:51:01.483
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1:51:01.650 --> 1:51:02.775
- Yes.
- Say it!

1:51:02.942 --> 1:51:06.817
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1:51:06.983 --> 1:51:09.275
- Karen! Everyone's waiting.
- I'm coming, Don.

1:51:10.317 --> 1:51:11.650
You have a deal.

1:51:12.233 --> 1:51:13.483
You're so fucked.

1:51:13.858 --> 1:51:15.150
What?

1:51:15.692 --> 1:51:17.525
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1:51:17.692 --> 1:51:19.942
- Take a wild guess.
- Is there a problem?

1:51:20.108 --> 1:51:22.817
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1:51:22.983 --> 1:51:25.775
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

1:51:25.942 --> 1:51:27.525
Is this fellow bothering you?

1:51:27.692 --> 1:51:28.942
Am I bothering you?

1:51:29.108 --> 1:51:33.150
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1:51:33.317 --> 1:51:34.983
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1:51:35.192 --> 1:51:38.817
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1:51:39.692 --> 1:51:40.983
All right. Here we go.

1:51:41.150 --> 1:51:44.317
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1:51:45.942 --> 1:51:48.650
- What are you doing?
- We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1:51:48.858 --> 1:51:51.150
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1:51:51.358 --> 1:51:54.608
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1:51:54.775 --> 1:51:56.942
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1:51:57.108 --> 1:51:58.858
Have your guys cover every exit.

1:51:59.025 --> 1:52:01.817
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1:52:02.483 --> 1:52:03.817
Did you get all that?

1:52:04.025 --> 1:52:06.192
Yeah. Got it.

1:52:09.858 --> 1:52:12.650
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1:52:12.858 --> 1:52:14.317
Sure.

1:52:14.692 --> 1:52:17.483
Just stay close, okay?

1:52:17.650 --> 1:52:18.858
Okay.

1:53:29.442 --> 1:53:31.275
So, what are we doing?

1:53:38.358 --> 1:53:40.317
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1:53:42.192 --> 1:53:43.858
Just drive.
