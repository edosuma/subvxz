WEBVTT

00:57.084 --> 00:59.780
You will tell me
all that you know.

01:00.955 --> 01:02.599
Who you are...

01:02.623 --> 01:04.715
how you ended up here...

01:06.827 --> 01:10.140
what you are doing.

01:10.164 --> 01:12.098
And you will talk.

01:16.404 --> 01:19.396
I'm not going
to tell you anything.

01:50.369 --> 01:53.539
The Soviets had some success

01:54.367 --> 01:56.164
with pure ethanol.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.290
This formula

02:01.307 --> 02:04.111
is of my own design.

02:04.136 --> 02:06.638
A mixture of sodium Pentothal

02:07.321 --> 02:10.600
and several other agents
I have found...

02:10.624 --> 02:12.536
effective

02:12.560 --> 02:14.805
in extracting the truth.

02:14.829 --> 02:17.457
It will not take long
for it to start working.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.981
You're going to be dead soon,
you know.

02:23.337 --> 02:26.116
Truth or not.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.852
I tell you, I think this
stuff's working already.

02:28.876 --> 02:31.955
You know, I...

02:31.979 --> 02:34.277
I have, uh, studied America.

02:35.583 --> 02:37.312
Carefully.

02:38.352 --> 02:41.698
I believe in knowing

02:41.722 --> 02:44.468
my enemy.

02:44.492 --> 02:48.138
I believe a man is as big
as what he's seeking.

02:48.162 --> 02:50.824
I believe you're a big man,
Mr. MacReedy.

02:52.399 --> 02:54.845
My name is Saleem Ulman.

02:54.869 --> 02:56.996
You will tell me who you are.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.589
I'm very Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo

03:05.613 --> 03:08.859
of the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

03:08.883 --> 03:12.329
You know, a few months ago,
I had, uh,

03:12.353 --> 03:16.032
not even heard of NCIS.

03:16.056 --> 03:20.220
And that may have cost the lives
of several of my people.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.541
That will not happen again.

03:24.565 --> 03:26.977
Now, please, tell me,

03:27.001 --> 03:29.561
what is your mission?

03:35.109 --> 03:39.322
We're... we're tasked
with pursuing crimes

03:39.346 --> 03:42.425
that involve the United States
Navy or Marine Corps

03:42.449 --> 03:44.060
and their families.

03:44.084 --> 03:49.290
And our duties are expansive.

03:50.624 --> 03:55.071
International terrorism,
espionage.

03:55.095 --> 03:57.073
Even, uh, you know,

03:57.097 --> 03:58.608
an eight ball
of methamphetamine.

03:58.632 --> 04:00.793
Stand down,
Petty Officer Dimarco!

04:02.169 --> 04:04.281
- You hit him high, I'll hit him low.
- I don't like

04:04.305 --> 04:06.149
- the sound of that.
- You hit him low, I'll hit him high.

04:06.173 --> 04:08.151
Our team consists
of a gang of four.

04:08.175 --> 04:09.452
Tight-knit.

04:09.476 --> 04:12.055
My partner is Tim McGee.

04:12.079 --> 04:13.957
Small muscles, big brain,
heart of a lion.

04:13.981 --> 04:16.593
Together, we're virtually
unstoppable.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.928
- Virtually.
- I got him!

04:18.952 --> 04:20.579
Tony, he's going for the knife!

04:22.089 --> 04:24.467
Our team leader is the fearless.

04:24.491 --> 04:27.370
Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

04:27.394 --> 04:31.074
Former gunnery sergeant,
marine sniper,

04:31.098 --> 04:33.977
coffee aficionado
and functional mute.

04:34.001 --> 04:36.012
- Piece of cake.
- Simple as pie.

04:36.036 --> 04:37.731
Yeah, smooth as silk.

04:40.975 --> 04:43.043
And the fourth member
of your team?

04:45.212 --> 04:47.357
Lost her.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.859
- Her?
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.883 --> 04:54.164
For the last four years,
that slot has been filled

04:54.188 --> 04:59.035
by Mossad Liaison Officer
Ziva David.

04:59.059 --> 05:01.838
- Mossad.
- Mossad.

05:01.862 --> 05:06.509
- And, uh, NCIS.
- That's right.

05:06.533 --> 05:09.846
The organizations

05:09.870 --> 05:12.315
responsible for the deaths
of my men.

05:12.339 --> 05:15.352
Oh, geez.
Well, all I can say is,

05:15.376 --> 05:18.607
if we killed them,
they must have been bad guys.

05:19.747 --> 05:21.180
They were martyrs for the cause!

05:22.850 --> 05:25.895
So, your team is here,
then, what, to finish the job?

05:25.919 --> 05:28.064
To shut down my organization?

05:28.088 --> 05:31.167
Say, can I get a glass
of Chardonnay or something?

05:31.191 --> 05:33.861
Is your team here
to finish the job?!

05:35.429 --> 05:38.108
Not only are you wrong,

05:38.132 --> 05:41.878
but you're wrong
at the top of your voice.

05:41.902 --> 05:44.514
What does that mean, huh?

05:44.538 --> 05:46.650
Can you imagine Nicholson
in Bad Day at Black Rock?

05:46.674 --> 05:48.718
- I would have liked to see that.
- Listen to me.

05:48.742 --> 05:51.988
Where is the rest of your team?

05:52.012 --> 05:54.658
I don't know.

05:54.682 --> 05:57.776
I don't care about your team.

05:59.253 --> 06:02.381
I don't care about my team.

06:07.761 --> 06:09.854
Hmm. Okay.

06:11.799 --> 06:13.777
You were driving in the desert

06:13.801 --> 06:16.179
without backup.

06:16.203 --> 06:18.748
So, what are you doing here?

06:18.772 --> 06:21.217
Well, Saleem,
there's only one force on Earth

06:21.241 --> 06:24.254
that can short-circuit
a man's better instincts,

06:24.278 --> 06:26.189
put fire in his veins

06:26.213 --> 06:28.258
and makes him dive
headlong into danger

06:28.282 --> 06:31.376
with no regard
for his own well-being.

06:33.487 --> 06:36.923
Vengeance, Saleem.

06:39.259 --> 06:41.784
I'm here to kill you.

06:52.973 --> 06:54.964
Vendetta.

06:58.379 --> 07:02.125
DiNozzo is an Italian name.

07:02.149 --> 07:04.694
An educated man.

07:04.718 --> 07:07.731
Got my BS from Yale University.

07:07.755 --> 07:09.799
Yale.

07:09.823 --> 07:12.569
I got my BS on the streets.

07:12.593 --> 07:14.104
Yale.

07:14.128 --> 07:17.140
You guys got a lousy
football team.

07:17.164 --> 07:19.376
18 national championships.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.611
Wow. When was
the last time you won one,

07:21.635 --> 07:22.879
a hundred years ago?

07:22.903 --> 07:24.281
1927.

07:24.305 --> 07:25.982
Oops.

07:26.006 --> 07:28.218
Short memories.

07:28.242 --> 07:32.455
As a people,
that is my impression of you.

07:32.479 --> 07:34.324
Wait, sorry,
you did an impression of me?

07:34.348 --> 07:35.425
I missed it.

07:35.449 --> 07:37.327
Go back, do it again,
but this time,

07:37.351 --> 07:39.863
why don't you
gargle with some sand.

07:39.887 --> 07:41.765
Get that basso profundo going.

07:41.789 --> 07:43.099
That's how you nail my essence.

07:43.123 --> 07:44.467
It's all in the voice.

07:44.491 --> 07:47.370
How did you choose me...

07:47.394 --> 07:49.506
as the, um...

07:49.530 --> 07:52.842
target of your bloodlust?

07:52.866 --> 07:54.844
I didn't.

07:54.868 --> 07:58.949
Hell, a little while ago,
I didn't even know you existed.

07:58.973 --> 08:01.875
I was happier then.

08:03.777 --> 08:06.122
Tony, I'm not
your home theater guy.

08:06.146 --> 08:07.524
Don't be redunculous.

08:07.548 --> 08:09.292
Of course you're
my home theater guy.

08:09.316 --> 08:10.760
All right,
you getting a picture?

08:10.784 --> 08:12.762
Yeah, it's just not crisp,
you know.

08:12.786 --> 08:14.164
It's not rich.

08:14.188 --> 08:16.700
What's your source,
Blu-ray or satellite?

08:16.724 --> 08:20.003
Neither.
It's the, uh, streaming HD thing

08:20.027 --> 08:21.204
from a Netfilms account.

08:21.228 --> 08:22.439
The greens are blue,

08:22.463 --> 08:24.541
the blues are green,
the oranges are pink

08:24.565 --> 08:26.610
and the reds
are sort of eggplant-y.

08:26.634 --> 08:28.244
Sounds like a problem
with your component cables.

08:28.268 --> 08:29.546
You streaming
through a wireless setup?

08:29.570 --> 08:30.847
Because if it's HD,

08:30.871 --> 08:32.148
you really need
Wireless-N components.

08:32.172 --> 08:35.784
Also, plasma... 1080i, 1080p?

08:35.808 --> 08:37.120
Will you just come over
and fix it?

08:37.144 --> 08:38.388
What's in it for me?

08:38.412 --> 08:40.523
Digitally remastered
1955 classic,

08:40.547 --> 08:42.125
Bad Day at Black Rock.

08:42.149 --> 08:43.960
Spencer Tracy with one arm.

08:43.984 --> 08:45.795
Is that anything like money?

08:45.819 --> 08:47.230
Because money is what
is customarily exchanged

08:47.254 --> 08:48.465
for services rendered.

08:48.489 --> 08:50.367
It's computers. It's your thing.

08:50.391 --> 08:53.036
If I had a thing, I would
show it off all the time.

08:53.060 --> 08:54.638
There are rules
against that, DiNozzo.

08:54.662 --> 08:55.905
Grab your gear.

08:55.929 --> 08:57.226
We got a dead petty officer.

08:58.098 --> 08:59.309
Another meth overdose?

08:59.333 --> 09:00.698
You know as much as I do.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.415
Tony, now?

09:05.439 --> 09:07.384
It feels like now.

09:07.408 --> 09:09.352
- You want to go?
- No, you go.

09:09.376 --> 09:10.920
I got to gather my thoughts.

09:10.944 --> 09:12.536
Hey, boss?

09:14.081 --> 09:17.050
I think it's time
we filled the empty chair.

09:18.519 --> 09:20.397
Oh, you do?

09:20.421 --> 09:22.265
Yeah, we do. It's, uh...
it's the right time.

09:22.289 --> 09:23.667
We got to get started on this.

09:23.691 --> 09:25.811
Personnel files are starting
to stack up on your desk.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.278
Okay.

09:35.302 --> 09:37.514
You pick. After we get back.

09:37.538 --> 09:39.149
Fist things first... got to
narrow down prospective agents.

09:39.173 --> 09:40.250
It's got to be a woman.

09:40.274 --> 09:41.618
Those are just the women.

09:41.642 --> 09:42.852
Are there photos in here, boss?

09:42.876 --> 09:44.754
Boss, really? Tony picks?

09:44.778 --> 09:46.289
Because, you know,
coming from anyone else,

09:46.313 --> 09:48.058
that might be considered
a lapse in judgment.

09:48.082 --> 09:50.293
Okay, you both pick.

09:50.317 --> 09:52.195
That makes much more sense.

09:52.219 --> 09:53.897
You don't trust me
to be professional?

09:53.921 --> 09:55.513
No casting couch.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.537
Petty Officer Kevin Wingate.

10:00.561 --> 10:01.771
Disciplined for drug possession.

10:01.795 --> 10:02.939
Low quantity.

10:02.963 --> 10:05.108
- Personal use?
- What kind of discipline?

10:05.132 --> 10:06.976
60-day restriction.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.445
Oh. He hasn't been off the boat?

10:08.469 --> 10:10.213
Not in two months.

10:10.237 --> 10:11.581
Well, he didn't
get the dose on land,

10:11.605 --> 10:12.816
he could have cooked
it up himself.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.684
Or someone brought it to him.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.252
Shipmates thought he'd kicked.

10:16.276 --> 10:18.054
I guess he fell off.

10:18.078 --> 10:19.956
We do not guess, Timothy.

10:19.980 --> 10:24.661
Nor do we assume, presume,
conjecture or prognosticate.

10:24.685 --> 10:29.199
While not officially a member
of our field team,

10:29.223 --> 10:33.403
Ducky is an essential element
in the investigative process.

10:33.427 --> 10:36.639
An encyclopedic mind
that never stops working.

10:36.663 --> 10:39.943
Sometimes his mind is connected
directly to his mouth.

10:39.967 --> 10:42.445
Dilated pupils,

10:42.469 --> 10:43.480
profuse sweating.

10:43.504 --> 10:44.848
His shirt's still damp.

10:44.872 --> 10:48.084
Brings to mind a classmate
of mine in medical school.

10:48.108 --> 10:52.622
E. Landon Reginald
Ailsworth III.

10:52.646 --> 10:53.857
Nobody's named that.

10:53.881 --> 10:55.458
Except his father.

10:55.482 --> 10:57.160
And his father's father.

10:57.184 --> 10:59.429
Reggie concocted
his own amphetamines.

10:59.453 --> 11:01.531
He liked to use the stuff
to keep himself awake

11:01.555 --> 11:03.666
while cramming for exams.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.636
Ended up the final himself
when he passed out

11:06.660 --> 11:08.171
half an hour
before pencils down.

11:08.195 --> 11:09.806
Reggie made it.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.775
This fellow
was not so fortunate.

11:11.799 --> 11:14.477
Death about six hours ago.

11:14.501 --> 11:17.881
McGee, finish sketching
an inventory

11:17.905 --> 11:19.349
of Wingate's locker.

11:19.373 --> 11:20.617
DiNozzo, duty roster.

11:20.641 --> 11:23.453
Prints, trace... scour this ship.

11:23.477 --> 11:26.378
So many tasks, so few hands.

11:27.414 --> 11:31.528
Have either of you two
heard from Ziva?

11:31.552 --> 11:32.862
No.

11:32.886 --> 11:34.030
You?

11:34.054 --> 11:35.231
No.

11:35.255 --> 11:38.601
It's all so very sad.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.136
But I suppose the time comes

11:40.160 --> 11:42.172
to move on.

11:42.196 --> 11:44.164
Yeah.

11:47.401 --> 11:49.870
- Thank you, pantsuit girl.
- Mm-hmm.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.551
This is Claire Connell
from the DEA.

11:54.575 --> 11:56.553
Pleased to meet you,

11:56.577 --> 11:58.188
Special Agent DiNozzo.

11:58.212 --> 11:59.255
Hi.

11:59.279 --> 12:01.324
Tony.

12:01.348 --> 12:02.892
We don't really stand
on formality here.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.127
Why don't you have a seat.

12:04.151 --> 12:05.728
Wowsers! That's some grip.

12:05.752 --> 12:08.031
Yeah. I was a pack-a-day smoker.

12:08.055 --> 12:10.046
Quit by occupying my hands
with Power Putty.

12:11.258 --> 12:12.569
Look at that.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.170
Demonstrates strong will.

12:14.194 --> 12:15.371
Excellent aptitude scores,

12:15.395 --> 12:18.274
high reviews from her colleagues
at the DEA.

12:18.298 --> 12:19.676
I see that.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.111
So, why would you want
to leave, then, Claire?

12:22.135 --> 12:24.569
I was involved in a relationship
of a personal nature.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.517
Became difficult for, uh,
the other party

12:27.541 --> 12:28.751
to control their emotions

12:28.775 --> 12:30.386
in the workplace setting.

12:30.410 --> 12:32.401
Yeah. Got to hate clingy guys.

12:33.714 --> 12:34.757
Clingy girls?

12:34.781 --> 12:36.025
He didn't ask.

12:36.049 --> 12:37.694
- So don't tell.
- It was interfering

12:37.718 --> 12:39.262
with my ability
to perform my duties

12:39.286 --> 12:41.064
- at the highest level.
- Sure, sure.

12:41.088 --> 12:43.366
You know those movies where they
have the really beautiful woman,

12:43.390 --> 12:46.202
but they put her in the big
glasses and tie her hair back

12:46.226 --> 12:47.403
and have her march around

12:47.427 --> 12:49.138
in the big, baggy clothes,

12:49.162 --> 12:51.941
but then the turn comes,
the penny drops,

12:51.965 --> 12:55.745
and the ugly duckling magically
transforms into a swan?

12:55.769 --> 12:57.413
Oh, that won't be an issue.

12:57.437 --> 12:58.781
I find that

12:58.805 --> 13:00.984
my looks have the tendency

13:01.008 --> 13:03.286
to prevent people
from taking me seriously.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.654
That's fantastic.

13:04.678 --> 13:06.055
She has my vote.

13:06.079 --> 13:08.124
- Really?
- Really.

13:08.148 --> 13:10.326
All right, okay.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.794
Let's start
the on-the-job training.

13:11.818 --> 13:14.130
Of course, Special Agent Gibbs
will make the final decision.

13:14.154 --> 13:15.932
Let's go see him.

13:15.956 --> 13:17.901
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.269
Okay.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.004
Right this way.

13:21.028 --> 13:22.739
You know,
it's all about chemistry,

13:22.763 --> 13:25.909
the zing, the s... the pah!

13:25.933 --> 13:28.111
What is "pah"?

13:28.135 --> 13:29.779
Pah. You know.

13:29.803 --> 13:31.915
Got to know how to zig
when I zag.

13:31.939 --> 13:34.417
Got to know how to bob
when you weave,

13:34.441 --> 13:35.818
rock when he rolls.

13:35.842 --> 13:37.887
That's the pah of it all.

13:37.911 --> 13:39.956
Pah!

13:39.980 --> 13:42.816
- She's unflappable.
- She's unflappable.

13:47.821 --> 13:49.379
Strike one.

13:51.992 --> 13:56.005
Might be a little easier to find
a new drummer for Spinal Tap.

13:56.029 --> 13:59.175
Ziva's not replaceable.

13:59.199 --> 14:03.046
The, um... the one you lost.

14:03.070 --> 14:07.283
Then, why aren't you
looking for her?

14:07.307 --> 14:11.387
If I could drag her back,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

14:11.411 --> 14:13.402
But that's impossible.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.414
Ziva David is dead.

14:33.267 --> 14:34.677
I've always been fascinated

14:34.701 --> 14:37.380
by simple cause and effect
reactions...

14:37.404 --> 14:40.049
what can be done
to the human body

14:40.073 --> 14:42.166
just by adding or subtracting.

14:43.510 --> 14:48.057
My own personal drug of choice
since my college days

14:48.081 --> 14:50.293
is caffeine.

14:50.317 --> 14:53.980
Keeps me sharp, alert.

15:00.627 --> 15:03.907
You are probably
feeling clarity,

15:03.931 --> 15:06.910
an impulse to talk
without censor.

15:06.934 --> 15:10.280
It's a chemical process
taking place in your brain.

15:10.304 --> 15:11.681
Now,

15:11.705 --> 15:13.750
I understand
your instinct to resist,

15:13.774 --> 15:16.719
but in actuality,
you are speeding the release

15:16.743 --> 15:20.873
of adrenaline,
which only serves as a catalyst.

15:25.219 --> 15:27.797
That's better.

15:27.821 --> 15:30.949
It's less painful that way.

15:35.762 --> 15:40.199
Who is in, um, control
of the flow of information?

15:42.102 --> 15:46.082
Must be a lonely place to sit
at the top of the pyramid.

15:46.106 --> 15:48.751
Not to mention...

15:48.775 --> 15:51.107
wee bit uncomfortable.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.391
Leon Vance.

15:55.415 --> 15:58.161
Some people don't like him,
some people don't trust him,

15:58.185 --> 16:00.897
wish someone else
were in his place.

16:00.921 --> 16:03.900
Show me someone who doesn't
complain about their boss,

16:03.924 --> 16:06.836
they're either lying
or they're unemployed.

16:06.860 --> 16:09.973
Got an update on the meth ring?

16:09.997 --> 16:13.009
Petty Officer Dimarco
is recovering.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.944
Question him today.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.179
Hope he can shed some light,

16:16.203 --> 16:18.047
at least on who put
the knife in him.

16:18.071 --> 16:20.483
One set of prints, Leon.

16:20.507 --> 16:22.998
He was so out of his mind
that he stabbed himself?

16:24.678 --> 16:26.789
Been hitting a lot of dead ends.

16:26.813 --> 16:28.291
Yeah, well,
we've been one short.

16:28.315 --> 16:29.292
How goes the search

16:29.316 --> 16:31.194
for David's replacement?

16:31.218 --> 16:32.595
DiNozzo's got a new candidate.

16:32.619 --> 16:33.763
You heard anything about Ziva?

16:33.787 --> 16:34.764
No.

16:34.788 --> 16:36.799
Two months in the dark now.

16:36.823 --> 16:39.969
But Mossad tends to operate
behind a veil of secrecy.

16:39.993 --> 16:42.105
You've confirmed
she's part of Mossad again?

16:42.129 --> 16:43.539
Yeah, I believe so.

16:43.563 --> 16:45.775
- Field?
- Likely.

16:45.799 --> 16:47.699
But you haven't heard anything?

16:49.303 --> 16:51.748
You've got a good relationship
with Director David.

16:51.772 --> 16:53.016
You figure

16:53.040 --> 16:54.717
the subject of his daughter
must have come up.

16:54.741 --> 16:56.286
Man's got to have some feelings

16:56.310 --> 16:58.187
about putting her back
in the field.

16:58.211 --> 17:02.792
Well, he must be sharing them
with somebody else if he does.

17:02.816 --> 17:04.977
Eli's being tight-lipped
about it.

17:09.256 --> 17:12.201
Like you, Leon?

17:12.224 --> 17:14.837
I don't have anything to share.

17:14.861 --> 17:16.172
But you think he does.

17:16.195 --> 17:18.528
And I'm tap-dancing
around the edges.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.236
Yeah, I know how that goes.

17:25.238 --> 17:27.183
Petty Officer, I know that,

17:27.207 --> 17:28.217
physically, you've been through

17:28.241 --> 17:30.687
quite an ordeal
these past few months.

17:30.711 --> 17:33.407
We're hoping that you could tell
us where the drugs came from.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.826
Well, I wouldn't know
what they look like, sir.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.194
I mean, I don't take drugs.

17:38.218 --> 17:40.863
Someone must have slipped them
in my orange juice.

17:40.887 --> 17:43.232
Why would they do that?

17:43.256 --> 17:45.101
Isn't that how you take them?

17:45.125 --> 17:47.103
Where did you see that?

17:47.127 --> 17:49.339
I think it was
an episode of 90210.

17:49.363 --> 17:50.974
I never really liked that show.

17:50.998 --> 17:52.299
Not my cup of tea.

17:54.167 --> 17:57.513
So, how come Agent McGee
is conducting the interrogation?

17:57.537 --> 17:59.349
We prefer the word "interview."

17:59.373 --> 18:01.384
"Interrogation," uh, has

18:01.408 --> 18:03.086
a negative association.

18:03.110 --> 18:04.220
Okay.

18:04.244 --> 18:05.254
Got it.

18:05.278 --> 18:06.856
So, what do they call
these rooms?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.958
Observation.

18:08.982 --> 18:11.151
And the other side of the glass?

18:12.319 --> 18:14.297
Not everything has a name.

18:14.321 --> 18:16.599
I thought I heard someone
refer to it as interrogation.

18:16.623 --> 18:19.569
Well, you know, maybe that's
some kind of informal shorthand.

18:19.593 --> 18:20.703
Oh, really?

18:20.727 --> 18:21.738
Yeah.

18:21.762 --> 18:22.872
Agent McGee's in there

18:22.896 --> 18:25.174
softening the big guy up
for the bigger guy.

18:25.198 --> 18:27.276
Agent Gibbs
is going to crack him.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.045
Crack him for what?

18:29.069 --> 18:30.780
Buying the wrong hit of meth?

18:30.804 --> 18:32.839
This guy doesn't know
anything about anything.

18:35.308 --> 18:38.154
You expect him
to give up his dealer?

18:38.178 --> 18:39.889
Well, let's see if you
can figure it out.

18:39.913 --> 18:42.425
Is this some sort of test?

18:42.449 --> 18:44.961
You like tests?

18:44.985 --> 18:47.886
Is that some sort of test?

18:49.356 --> 18:51.200
No.

18:51.224 --> 18:55.004
I mean, it's...
e-everything's a test.

18:55.028 --> 18:57.087
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.878
Looks like
they pulled up stakes.

19:01.902 --> 19:03.946
Haven't been able to determine
where they resettled,

19:03.970 --> 19:05.248
if they resettled.

19:05.272 --> 19:06.249
Captives?

19:06.273 --> 19:07.316
Possibly.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.085
NCIS confirmed the presence

19:09.109 --> 19:11.120
of a woman... no I.D. and no idea

19:11.144 --> 19:12.688
whether or not
she's still with them.

19:12.712 --> 19:14.757
You're doing a bang-up job
there, Chad.

19:14.781 --> 19:17.493
I'm a long way
from Dubai, Gibbs.

19:17.517 --> 19:19.695
Our local network tends to rely

19:19.719 --> 19:21.697
on nomads roaming the desert.

19:21.721 --> 19:23.399
They don't tend
to like our faces much.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.368
Though they'd respect mine
more than they would yours.

19:25.392 --> 19:27.170
You think so, huh?

19:27.194 --> 19:28.404
One look
at that baby-smooth skin

19:28.428 --> 19:29.839
and they might think
they spotted another girl.

19:29.863 --> 19:31.174
Careful.

19:31.198 --> 19:33.238
Don't go getting all native
on me out there, Dunham.

19:35.168 --> 19:38.314
Chad reporting from Chad.

19:38.338 --> 19:41.017
Next up, Captain Rebecca
"Becky" Hastings,

19:41.041 --> 19:42.919
U.S. Air Force.

19:42.943 --> 19:43.986
Fighter jock.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.822
Yeah, grounded for medical.

19:45.846 --> 19:48.091
Natural born thrill seeker.

19:48.115 --> 19:50.293
Likes to live on the edge,
take risks.

19:50.317 --> 19:51.461
Pretty eyes.

19:51.485 --> 19:53.496
Thinks NCIS might offer some

19:53.520 --> 19:54.564
new challenges.

19:54.588 --> 19:55.731
Real daredevil.

19:55.755 --> 19:57.633
What do you think?

19:57.657 --> 20:01.528
Oh, uh, well, women.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:07.901 --> 20:10.426
So, what was that about,
with Dunham?

20:12.506 --> 20:15.805
Tracking terrorist training
camps in the Sahara Desert.

20:17.777 --> 20:20.423
And the woman you were
talking about, the captive...

20:20.447 --> 20:22.677
uh, any theory who she is?

20:24.818 --> 20:28.731
Dunham says that Mossad presence
has increased in North Africa.

20:28.755 --> 20:30.867
Prepping an offensive?

20:30.891 --> 20:33.870
Or course correction,
cleaning up a failure.

20:33.894 --> 20:35.671
What kind of failure?

20:35.695 --> 20:38.174
The kind with casualties.

20:38.198 --> 20:39.893
Is that all you know?

20:42.369 --> 20:43.880
That's all you can tell me.

20:43.904 --> 20:45.047
I got it.

20:45.071 --> 20:46.516
All right.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.118
You know, in Arabic, the word
for "desert" is "sahara,"

20:49.142 --> 20:51.821
so Sahara Desert
is actually Desert Desert.

20:51.845 --> 20:53.437
Lot of sand.

20:54.881 --> 20:56.759
Doc pulled the plug
on my Dimarco interview.

20:56.783 --> 21:01.397
Said the, um, strain was
too much for his weakened heart.

21:01.421 --> 21:03.286
Yeah.

21:05.225 --> 21:07.803
Gibbs signed off on the new
girl... Rebecca Hastings.

21:07.827 --> 21:08.971
Seems like a pistol.

21:08.995 --> 21:11.274
Or a firecracker.

21:11.298 --> 21:12.458
Maybe a spitfire.

21:18.305 --> 21:20.149
I've been thinking about buying

21:20.173 --> 21:22.518
some tight red leather pants.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.487
You know, something
that really cradles my butt.

21:24.511 --> 21:25.821
It's not normal.

21:25.845 --> 21:27.423
I'm kidding.
I'm not really going to buy...

21:27.447 --> 21:29.091
It's not normal that we
haven't heard from Ziva.

21:29.115 --> 21:30.293
I mean, nothing!

21:30.317 --> 21:32.295
Not in this much time.

21:32.319 --> 21:33.796
It's not normal.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.465
Well, maybe she just wants
to make a clean break of it.

21:36.489 --> 21:37.500
Well, maybe

21:37.524 --> 21:39.135
from some of us,
but not all of us.

21:39.159 --> 21:41.519
Unless you did something to her
you're not telling me about.

21:46.066 --> 21:48.398
It's not normal.

21:50.904 --> 21:52.281
No, it's not.

21:52.305 --> 21:54.684
Thank you.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.987
What if she
can't contact us, huh?

21:58.011 --> 21:59.789
What if something's
stopping her?

21:59.813 --> 22:01.958
Or someone.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.926
Yeah.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.062
I'm not the only one
thinking this, am I?

22:06.086 --> 22:07.096
No.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.598
And you know Gibbs is thinking

22:08.622 --> 22:10.366
about it, too...
he's not talking about it,

22:10.390 --> 22:11.567
but he's definitely
sniffing around.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.202
So, what are you
going to do about it?

22:13.226 --> 22:14.437
Everything I can.

22:14.461 --> 22:16.405
I'm going to start digging.

22:16.429 --> 22:18.274
Well, you can't do it alone.

22:18.298 --> 22:20.476
You going to stop me?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.991
That's not what I said.

22:25.739 --> 22:27.516
When he wakes up,

22:27.540 --> 22:30.253
you will learn...

22:30.277 --> 22:32.321
what a mistake your partner made

22:32.345 --> 22:33.937
following your lead.

22:47.095 --> 22:49.307
You believe I am responsible

22:49.331 --> 22:51.242
for the death
of this Ziva David.

22:51.266 --> 22:54.345
So, you travel halfway

22:54.369 --> 22:56.514
around the world

22:56.538 --> 22:59.517
to kill me.

22:59.541 --> 23:00.718
That is insane.

23:00.742 --> 23:02.978
I'm insane?

23:04.346 --> 23:05.947
You kill indiscriminately.

23:07.582 --> 23:11.462
Wars are measured
in body counts.

23:11.486 --> 23:12.864
The news carries

23:12.888 --> 23:15.199
a running tally.

23:15.223 --> 23:18.202
You change the world

23:18.226 --> 23:19.716
with rivers of blood.

23:20.829 --> 23:24.709
There is no reason
to kill just one person.

23:24.733 --> 23:27.930
Oh, sure, there is.

23:30.071 --> 23:31.868
How did you find me?

23:34.109 --> 23:35.953
I'm skilled.

23:35.977 --> 23:37.455
You did it...

23:37.479 --> 23:39.223
by yourself?

23:39.247 --> 23:41.459
Really?

23:41.483 --> 23:42.693
No.

23:42.717 --> 23:43.945
Not really.

23:47.923 --> 23:50.050
How did you find me?

23:52.427 --> 23:54.361
Who are you leaving out?

23:56.131 --> 23:57.975
I can't believe you were going
to leave me out.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.677
It wasn't personal.

23:59.701 --> 24:01.846
Abby, it was
for your own benefit.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.247
So, which was it?

24:03.271 --> 24:04.515
Abby Sciuto,

24:04.539 --> 24:06.984
NCIS resident
forensic scientist,

24:07.008 --> 24:08.986
heart and soul,

24:09.010 --> 24:10.721
a paradox wrapped
in an oxymoron,

24:10.745 --> 24:12.089
smothered in contradictions
in terms,

24:12.113 --> 24:13.758
sleeps in a coffin.

24:13.782 --> 24:16.427
Really, the happiest goth
you'll ever meet.

24:16.451 --> 24:17.862
It was hubris, you know.

24:17.886 --> 24:20.498
McGee thought he could do it
without you, and he was wrong.

24:20.522 --> 24:22.700
- He was so wrong.
- No, no, no. Abby, Abby,

24:22.724 --> 24:24.602
I was the one that wanted
to enlist your help.

24:24.626 --> 24:26.704
Can we get past this?

24:26.728 --> 24:28.139
Please.

24:28.163 --> 24:30.374
We've been tracking
Ziva's movements as best we can.

24:30.398 --> 24:31.676
Since when?

24:31.700 --> 24:33.144
Since she stayed in Israel.

24:33.168 --> 24:36.147
And took Rivkin's place
on the Kidon unit.

24:36.171 --> 24:37.982
I've been doing the same thing.

24:38.006 --> 24:40.851
I mean, it's weird
that Ziva hasn't contacted me.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.153
It'd be one thing
if she just hadn't

24:42.177 --> 24:43.521
picked up the phone
and called me,

24:43.545 --> 24:45.289
but I've tried to reach her
several different ways.

24:45.313 --> 24:46.824
Psychics, crystals or telepathy?

24:46.848 --> 24:48.726
No jokes.

24:48.750 --> 24:49.994
Okay?

24:50.018 --> 24:51.395
Ziva is universally absent.

24:51.419 --> 24:52.697
It's freaking me out.

24:52.721 --> 24:54.899
All right,
let's compare notes here.

24:54.923 --> 24:57.234
We've got NCIS on the ground
in Dubai trying to figure out

24:57.258 --> 24:58.536
what Mossad is up to.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.804
While Mossad's trying
to figure out

24:59.828 --> 25:00.938
what some terrorist is doing.

25:00.962 --> 25:02.840
And somewhere in the middle
of this is Ziva.

25:02.864 --> 25:05.109
And we know that Gibbs thinks

25:05.133 --> 25:07.478
the director knows more
than he's letting on.

25:07.502 --> 25:09.914
And no one's
telling us anything.

25:09.938 --> 25:11.716
- So, we have two options.
- And they're both illegal.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.384
Hack into Mossad...

25:13.408 --> 25:15.252
Or hack into Vance.

25:15.276 --> 25:17.188
Oh, that's it.

25:17.212 --> 25:18.689
I'm out of here.

25:18.713 --> 25:19.690
I'm done.

25:19.714 --> 25:21.025
So much for the daredevil.

25:21.049 --> 25:22.026
Forgot about her.

25:22.050 --> 25:23.027
Whatever.

25:23.051 --> 25:25.563
Let's get hacking.

25:25.587 --> 25:28.032
Yeah, Gibbs is, uh,
in interrogation.

25:28.056 --> 25:29.033
I'll take it.

25:29.057 --> 25:31.235
Damocles.

25:31.259 --> 25:33.004
Yeah, I know.
Like "The sword of."

25:33.028 --> 25:34.872
Out of Aqaba.

25:34.896 --> 25:35.873
Where is that, Jordan?

25:35.897 --> 25:38.409
- Tony.
- Nothing.

25:38.433 --> 25:40.211
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

25:40.235 --> 25:41.679
Are you Special Agent DiNozzo?

25:41.703 --> 25:43.728
No, I am.

25:44.773 --> 25:45.783
Who are you?

25:45.807 --> 25:47.918
Um, I'm Officer Heather Kincaid.

25:47.942 --> 25:49.773
I'm here about
the job interview.

25:51.046 --> 25:53.124
That you apparently
forgot about.

25:53.148 --> 25:55.026
No, I didn't.

25:55.050 --> 25:56.060
I didn't forget.

25:56.084 --> 25:57.895
I mean, you know...
Call you back.

25:57.919 --> 25:59.530
Uh, Heather Kincaid.

25:59.554 --> 26:01.098
Let's see, Seattle PD,

26:01.122 --> 26:02.366
just like your father
and your uncle.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.268
And two brothers.

26:04.292 --> 26:05.936
Four-year varsity starter.
U-Dub volleyball?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.071
- Go Huskies, yeah.
- Yeah.

26:07.095 --> 26:08.806
Listen, can you walk
while you talk?

26:08.830 --> 26:10.941
You know, I've actually
never attempted something

26:10.965 --> 26:13.010
so complex before,
but I'm a quick learner.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.412
- Sarcasm.
- Mm-hmm.

26:14.436 --> 26:15.946
I like sarcasm.

26:15.970 --> 26:17.314
Who doesn't?

26:17.338 --> 26:18.930
Not that much.

26:23.111 --> 26:25.756
Like I told you last time
I was brought in, sir,

26:25.780 --> 26:28.183
someone must have
slipped the drugs to me.

26:29.651 --> 26:31.796
Lots of enemies on board?

26:31.820 --> 26:33.464
No, sir.

26:33.488 --> 26:35.800
So, it's the opposite, then.

26:35.824 --> 26:37.134
Lots of friends.

26:37.158 --> 26:38.402
Yes, sir.

26:38.426 --> 26:39.737
I'm not sure what it is

26:39.761 --> 26:41.305
you're looking for exactly,
but...

26:41.329 --> 26:42.473
You're sure you're it?

26:42.497 --> 26:43.841
That's the pitch
you've been getting?

26:43.865 --> 26:46.477
Yeah, everybody's a perfect fit
for this job.

26:46.501 --> 26:48.435
Sure. In this economy.

26:50.505 --> 26:52.049
Can't just drop someone
in the mix.

26:52.073 --> 26:54.118
It's a lot harder
than it looks. Trust me.

26:54.142 --> 26:56.187
I'm only asking for a shot.

26:56.211 --> 26:57.855
Well, I don't know
if we need the help.

26:57.879 --> 26:59.590
Frankly, you got
a pretty good gig already.

26:59.614 --> 27:00.982
You don't need us.

27:02.083 --> 27:05.296
It's not you, it's me.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.651
Do you really want to do this?

27:07.789 --> 27:09.867
It's ridiculous.

27:09.891 --> 27:11.769
Look at this guy... this guy,

27:11.793 --> 27:13.537
who we've been
babying and coddling

27:13.561 --> 27:15.973
and nursing back to health
for the last three months.

27:15.997 --> 27:18.676
The poor, helpless drug victim
with the bad heart.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.844
Almost killed him.

27:19.868 --> 27:20.978
He's the dealer!

27:21.002 --> 27:22.913
After the first overdose

27:22.937 --> 27:24.315
- of your own rotten stash,
- his own rotten stash,

27:24.339 --> 27:26.117
- you dosed yourself.
- This guy dosed himself

27:26.141 --> 27:28.219
to draw suspicion
away from the fact that

27:28.243 --> 27:29.787
- you're the damn pusher!
- He's the pusher.

27:29.811 --> 27:31.055
He just wanted to get high.

27:31.079 --> 27:33.591
I didn't mean
for Kevin to end up dead.

27:33.615 --> 27:35.192
You got to believe me, sir.

27:35.216 --> 27:36.293
I'm sorry.

27:36.317 --> 27:38.696
And two dead
before we figured it out.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.930
Anyway, we're not hiring
right now.

27:39.954 --> 27:41.251
Sorry to waste your time.

27:52.567 --> 27:54.111
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:54.135 --> 27:56.380
It's the goat!

27:56.404 --> 27:57.548
The goat.

27:57.572 --> 27:58.949
Sounds like you got something.

27:58.973 --> 28:00.384
We're the two zuzim.

28:00.408 --> 28:03.954
Gibbs is our father,
and he used us to buy the goat.

28:03.978 --> 28:05.289
It all makes sense now.

28:05.313 --> 28:06.957
Sure.

28:06.981 --> 28:07.958
We accessed Mossad's

28:07.982 --> 28:09.660
encrypted files.

28:09.684 --> 28:10.828
They weren't in English,

28:10.852 --> 28:12.997
so we had to do a little
rudimentary linguistics.

28:13.021 --> 28:15.232
Hit the Hebrew school
nursery rhymes.

28:15.256 --> 28:16.567
Chad gadya, Tony, chad gadya.

28:16.591 --> 28:19.822
"One little goat that my father
bought for two zuzim."

28:21.863 --> 28:24.875
It was originally
an Aramaic children's song.

28:24.899 --> 28:27.211
Actually, way it goes,
uh, there's a part

28:27.235 --> 28:28.913
with God, an Angel of Death

28:28.937 --> 28:31.916
- and the killing...
- # That killed the butcher #

28:31.940 --> 28:34.051
- # That slew the ox #
- Killed the butcher.

28:34.075 --> 28:36.353
# That drank the
water that quenched the fire #

28:36.377 --> 28:38.656
# That burnt the stick
that beat the dog #

28:38.680 --> 28:40.658
# That bit the cat
that ate the goat #

28:40.682 --> 28:43.427
# Which my father
bought for two zuzim #

28:43.451 --> 28:44.862
# Chad gadya... #

28:44.886 --> 28:48.056
# Chad gadya. #

28:50.859 --> 28:52.236
So, what's the goat?

28:52.260 --> 28:54.505
It's the information
that McGee and I recovered

28:54.529 --> 28:56.240
from the burnt laptop
in Ziva's apartment.

28:56.264 --> 28:58.042
With the location of a camp

28:58.066 --> 29:00.411
in North Africa
run by a man named Saleem Ulman.

29:00.435 --> 29:02.913
We gave it to Gibbs,
Gibbs gave it to Vance,

29:02.937 --> 29:06.283
Vance gave it to Eli David,
who read it,

29:06.307 --> 29:08.018
and then he put Ziva and a team

29:08.042 --> 29:09.887
on a Jordanian freighter
called the Damocles.

29:09.911 --> 29:11.121
Out of Aqaba.

29:11.145 --> 29:13.023
Uh, yeah.

29:13.047 --> 29:14.592
Bound for the Horn of Africa.

29:14.616 --> 29:15.926
You got a manifest?

29:15.950 --> 29:17.061
It's a cargo ship.

29:17.085 --> 29:19.563
Could be a direct supply line
to Saleem.

29:19.587 --> 29:20.698
Where is it now?

29:20.722 --> 29:21.799
Don't know.

29:21.823 --> 29:23.100
Find it.

29:23.124 --> 29:24.935
We tried. It's...

29:24.959 --> 29:26.537
There's no record of it
appearing anywhere after May.

29:26.561 --> 29:27.738
Why not?

29:27.762 --> 29:29.573
'Cause it was lost at sea.

29:29.597 --> 29:31.792
Damocles went down
in a storm, 28th of May.

29:33.334 --> 29:36.030
Off the coast of Somalia.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.174
There were no survivors.

29:44.879 --> 29:47.424
After that...

29:47.448 --> 29:49.927
business as usual
lost all meaning.

29:49.951 --> 29:51.562
Blah, blah, blah.

29:51.586 --> 29:53.315
Computer stuff, blah.

29:54.989 --> 29:56.867
Autopsy report.

29:56.891 --> 29:58.235
Words.

29:58.259 --> 29:59.770
Just, there's so many words

29:59.794 --> 30:01.272
and-and there's things and...

30:01.296 --> 30:02.907
and stuff and emotions.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.626
Thanks for listening.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.610
Got a dead marine.

30:06.634 --> 30:08.145
Grab your gear.

30:08.169 --> 30:10.247
Got a missing kid.
Grab your gear.

30:10.271 --> 30:11.916
Some idiot smuggled a koala

30:11.940 --> 30:13.317
on a submarine. Grab your gear.

30:13.341 --> 30:16.320
Grab your gear. Grab your gear.
Grab your gear, your gear.

30:16.344 --> 30:17.936
No.

30:20.315 --> 30:22.783
No.

30:32.226 --> 30:33.591
No?

30:34.629 --> 30:36.674
We have an obligation.

30:36.698 --> 30:40.464
Saleem Ulman's got to be stopped
before one more person dies.

30:42.837 --> 30:44.702
Make your case.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.117
It's a supply chain.

30:47.141 --> 30:48.752
Everything moving
through the area...

30:48.776 --> 30:51.488
by ship, by truck,
by camel, by donkey.

30:51.512 --> 30:53.324
Everything Saleem
and his men need

30:53.348 --> 30:54.992
to stay alive
somewhere in the desert.

30:55.016 --> 30:57.795
NCIS on the ground in Africa has
tried to track common elements.

30:57.819 --> 31:00.331
Like weapons,
medical supplies, car parts,

31:00.355 --> 31:01.799
gasoline, food, drink.

31:01.823 --> 31:03.000
We have zeroed in

31:03.024 --> 31:05.035
on items
of a more personal nature...

31:05.059 --> 31:06.470
various, uh, batteries,

31:06.494 --> 31:08.572
electronics,
even music and entertainment.

31:08.596 --> 31:10.841
Because they are human,
after all.

31:10.865 --> 31:13.477
This is the manifest from
the lost cargo ship, Damocles.

31:13.501 --> 31:16.013
We know it was heading
for Saleem's camp,

31:16.037 --> 31:18.682
and it contains the cipher
to breaking our code.

31:18.706 --> 31:20.351
And have you?

31:20.375 --> 31:22.553
We believe we have.

31:22.577 --> 31:24.488
We've isolated the needle
in the haystack...

31:24.512 --> 31:27.358
an anomaly, one specific

31:27.382 --> 31:28.959
characteristic.

31:28.983 --> 31:30.594
A brand-name foreign import

31:30.618 --> 31:33.130
not easily available
in Europe or Africa.

31:33.154 --> 31:35.232
Got it all the way
from the United States

31:35.256 --> 31:36.734
at high cost, high difficulty.

31:36.758 --> 31:38.385
What are we talking about?

31:41.129 --> 31:43.120
Ta-da.

31:50.905 --> 31:53.373
You had to have your Caf-POW!
Didn't you?

31:54.275 --> 31:55.586
Hey, it's just a little

31:55.610 --> 31:57.021
chemical addiction; Don't worry.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.456
Maybe you picked that up
at your American college!

31:59.480 --> 32:01.492
Hey, maybe we're not so bad!

32:01.516 --> 32:04.385
You ought to rethink
your master plan!

32:06.154 --> 32:07.164
You okay, McGee?

32:07.188 --> 32:09.133
You awake?

32:09.157 --> 32:10.768
Yeah. When do we move?

32:10.792 --> 32:12.102
Not yet.

32:12.126 --> 32:13.537
He's rattled.

32:13.561 --> 32:15.005
It may be our best shot.

32:15.029 --> 32:16.164
Not yet.

32:17.198 --> 32:18.722
Wait for my cue.

32:20.601 --> 32:22.813
Questions
are being asked in town

32:22.837 --> 32:24.381
about missing NCIS agents,

32:24.405 --> 32:27.584
concern that U.S. forces
might mobilize.

32:27.608 --> 32:29.720
One of you will tell me
the identities

32:29.744 --> 32:32.189
and locations of all
the operatives in the area,

32:32.213 --> 32:34.477
and the other one will die.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.397
I'll give you a moment

32:40.421 --> 32:42.150
to decide who lives.

32:51.799 --> 32:54.825
Well, how was your summer?

33:09.851 --> 33:13.497
Out of everyone in the world
who could have found me,

33:13.521 --> 33:15.921
it had to be you.

33:18.226 --> 33:20.571
You're welcome.

33:20.595 --> 33:24.041
So, are you glad to see me?

33:24.065 --> 33:26.659
You should not have come.

33:28.836 --> 33:30.114
All right, then.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.482
Good catching up.

33:31.506 --> 33:33.133
I'll be going now.

33:34.175 --> 33:37.554
Oh. Oh, yeah, I forgot.

33:37.578 --> 33:40.357
Taken prisoner.

33:40.381 --> 33:43.680
Are you all right, McGee?

33:45.086 --> 33:47.452
I'm just glad you're alive.

33:49.257 --> 33:51.969
You thought I was dead.

33:51.993 --> 33:54.894
Oh... oh, yeah.

33:57.532 --> 33:59.343
Then, why are you here?

33:59.367 --> 34:01.278
Well, McGee...

34:01.302 --> 34:02.880
McGee didn't think
you were dead.

34:02.904 --> 34:07.238
Tony, why are you here?

34:09.777 --> 34:13.440
Couldn't live without you,
I guess.

34:15.283 --> 34:17.774
So, you will die with me.

34:19.954 --> 34:22.466
You should have left me alone.

34:22.489 --> 34:24.034
Okay, tried, couldn't.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.435
Listen, you should know

34:25.458 --> 34:27.170
I've taken some kind
of truth serum,

34:27.195 --> 34:28.572
so if there's any questions, uh,

34:28.596 --> 34:31.241
that you don't want
to know the answer to...

34:31.264 --> 34:33.043
I did not ask for anyone

34:33.067 --> 34:36.213
to put themselves
in harm's way for me.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.649
I do not deserve it.

34:38.672 --> 34:40.384
So, what are you doing out here,

34:40.408 --> 34:42.286
some kind
of a monastic experience?

34:42.310 --> 34:44.471
Doing penance?

34:45.513 --> 34:47.757
It is justified.

34:47.782 --> 34:50.045
Get over yourself.

34:51.085 --> 34:53.053
I have.

34:54.789 --> 34:58.035
Now, you tell Saleem
everything he wants to hear,

34:58.059 --> 35:00.704
and you try to save yourselves.

35:00.728 --> 35:03.073
I am ready to die.

35:03.097 --> 35:05.409
That's not how it works.

35:05.433 --> 35:08.478
How what works?

35:08.502 --> 35:10.581
The plan.

35:10.605 --> 35:13.174
You have an escape plan?

35:15.676 --> 35:17.821
Tony...

35:17.845 --> 35:21.592
they have 30 men, heavily armed.

35:21.616 --> 35:26.096
They have antitank,
antiaircraft weapons.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.998
What do you have?

35:28.022 --> 35:32.269
Well, that's where things
get a little tricky.

35:32.293 --> 35:34.137
- You don't have it.
- What do you mean,

35:34.161 --> 35:35.606
we don't have it?
That satellite photo

35:35.630 --> 35:37.641
is showing thermal activity
at this location.

35:37.665 --> 35:40.277
- Agent DiNozzo...
- We got 4x4s coming and going.

35:40.301 --> 35:41.778
We don't know how much longer
this guy's going to be there.

35:41.802 --> 35:43.647
We served this up
on a silver platter.

35:43.671 --> 35:45.349
You don't know
that he's there at all.

35:45.373 --> 35:47.150
We're not talking
about kicking in a door

35:47.174 --> 35:49.219
and dragging a guy out in cuffs.

35:49.243 --> 35:51.355
It's a military mission
on foreign soil.

35:51.379 --> 35:52.956
And he's a target of interest.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.558
And he's our only interest.

35:54.582 --> 35:56.226
Now, I've talked
with the Joint Chiefs,

35:56.250 --> 35:57.494
I've talked with Mossad.

35:57.518 --> 35:58.829
Hard truth is that

35:58.853 --> 36:00.530
we're not going
to send a SEAL team

36:00.554 --> 36:02.532
into the desert
based on a theory

36:02.556 --> 36:06.403
that Saleem Ulman can't live
without his daily Caf-POW!

36:06.427 --> 36:08.171
- Director...
- We need confirmation

36:08.195 --> 36:10.129
that he's there...
we don't have it.

36:11.499 --> 36:15.979
Under the present circumstances,
we just can't do it.

36:16.003 --> 36:19.404
I wish the circumstances
were different.

36:20.441 --> 36:22.204
So do I.

36:32.253 --> 36:34.197
Hey.

36:34.221 --> 36:36.052
- Hey!
- What?

36:38.125 --> 36:39.636
Is that it?

36:39.660 --> 36:43.106
Yeah. What else is there?

36:43.130 --> 36:47.644
Well, maybe we send a couple
of agents to the region.

36:47.668 --> 36:49.846
What for?

36:49.870 --> 36:52.683
Gather some intel.

36:52.707 --> 36:56.453
You know, put some eyes
on the target.

36:56.477 --> 36:58.488
Change the circumstances.

36:58.512 --> 37:01.825
- Change... the circumstances?
- Yeah.

37:01.849 --> 37:04.461
And you can sell that to Vance?

37:04.485 --> 37:07.364
Oh, yeah.
Strictly investigatively.

37:07.388 --> 37:09.333
- Of course.
- Of course.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.568
Wow. You guys have
a whole little thing going on

37:11.592 --> 37:13.337
that I'm not seeing,
but I get it.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.771
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge,
Bob's your uncle.

37:14.795 --> 37:16.773
- I'm hip. I dig it.
- Good, 'cause I need volunteers.

37:16.797 --> 37:19.042
I volunteer myself
and Special Agent McGee

37:19.066 --> 37:20.577
for the secret fact-finding
mission thingy,

37:20.601 --> 37:21.812
that's not secret,
in the Sahara.

37:21.836 --> 37:23.080
What are you going to do?

37:23.104 --> 37:25.048
You don't want to know.

37:25.072 --> 37:26.974
Good talk.

37:32.913 --> 37:34.124
Thanks for volunteering me.

37:34.148 --> 37:35.392
Come on!

37:35.416 --> 37:36.927
You always said you wanted
to travel.

37:36.951 --> 37:38.328
On my own time.

37:38.352 --> 37:40.330
On your own dime? Are you crazy?

37:40.354 --> 37:42.288
We could never afford this.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.171
That does it
for Quadrant Whiskey Four.

37:48.195 --> 37:49.719
Yeah.

37:54.235 --> 37:55.612
There's no sighting.

37:55.636 --> 37:57.627
I'm going to call it in.

37:58.973 --> 38:00.736
Uh... Timmy?

38:02.977 --> 38:04.087
Hello, gentlemen. Hi there.

38:04.111 --> 38:06.547
We come in peace. Say the thing.

38:08.482 --> 38:09.617
Say the other thing!

38:21.562 --> 38:25.709
Wait... you got captured
on purpose?

38:25.733 --> 38:27.811
Yeah.

38:27.835 --> 38:29.379
These men are killers, Tony.

38:29.403 --> 38:30.881
I know.

38:30.905 --> 38:35.051
That's why we have to stay alive
long enough to not get dead.

38:35.075 --> 38:37.454
That would involve
being rescued.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.623
Yes, it would.

38:39.647 --> 38:41.825
How long will it take?

38:41.849 --> 38:43.260
I don't know.

38:43.284 --> 38:45.362
How long do you think
I've been talking?

38:45.386 --> 38:46.897
What's the plan?

38:46.921 --> 38:50.867
Oh, well...

38:50.891 --> 38:52.102
we fail to contact Dubai,

38:52.126 --> 38:53.637
word gets to the carrier group

38:53.661 --> 38:56.306
in the Med and they scramble
F-22 Raptors

38:56.330 --> 39:00.510
that burn sand into glass.

39:00.534 --> 39:03.814
How long that's going to take,
I don't know.

39:03.838 --> 39:05.649
Hours or...

39:05.673 --> 39:07.575
days.

39:09.210 --> 39:12.737
Ziva, can you fight?

39:16.417 --> 39:17.694
Oh, hey, Saleem.

39:17.718 --> 39:20.230
What's up, man?
What's the commotion?

39:20.254 --> 39:21.731
We're moving out.

39:21.755 --> 39:22.999
Oh, well, that's good.

39:23.023 --> 39:24.534
I was getting kind of tired
of this place.

39:24.558 --> 39:26.269
We're not taking prisoners.

39:26.293 --> 39:29.506
Oh, well, okay,
it was nice talking with you.

39:29.530 --> 39:32.108
No. We're not done yet.

39:32.132 --> 39:33.610
If they do not check in,

39:33.634 --> 39:35.212
their people will come
looking for them.

39:35.236 --> 39:37.013
- Ziva, shut up.
- Kill me.

39:37.037 --> 39:38.882
You'll need the Americans
for leverage.

39:38.906 --> 39:41.885
I don't make bargains.

39:41.909 --> 39:43.672
- Do you make pizza?
- What?

39:47.748 --> 39:50.927
Stop! Stop! There's something
I haven't told you yet.

39:50.951 --> 39:52.462
And what is that?

39:52.486 --> 39:54.698
Well...

39:54.722 --> 39:56.099
I told you about the...

39:56.123 --> 39:57.868
the brains,
I told you about the guts,

39:57.892 --> 39:59.369
I told you about the muscle,

39:59.393 --> 40:00.871
the scientist, the politician,

40:00.895 --> 40:02.739
the leader. I told you

40:02.763 --> 40:05.642
about every member of the team
except myself.

40:05.666 --> 40:06.943
The part I play.

40:06.967 --> 40:08.525
Yeah, which is?

40:10.004 --> 40:11.248
I'm the wild card.

40:11.272 --> 40:12.916
I'm the guy who looks
at the reality

40:12.940 --> 40:14.784
in front of him
and refuses to accept it.

40:14.808 --> 40:16.920
Like, right now,
I should be terrified, right?

40:16.944 --> 40:18.788
But I'm not,
'cause I just can't stop

40:18.812 --> 40:20.891
thinking about the movie,
True Lies.

40:20.915 --> 40:22.125
You know, where Arnie's strapped
to the chair

40:22.149 --> 40:23.260
and shot full of truth serum,

40:23.284 --> 40:25.980
then he picks his cuffs
and kills everybody.

40:27.254 --> 40:29.484
You have 30 seconds
to live, Saleem.

40:32.326 --> 40:34.938
You're still bound.

40:34.962 --> 40:36.606
You're lying.

40:36.630 --> 40:39.776
I can't lie.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.045
And I didn't say I was going
to be the one to kill you.

40:42.069 --> 40:44.401
Remember when I told you
my boss was a sniper?

40:54.148 --> 40:56.026
Go.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.327
All assault teams move out!

40:57.351 --> 40:58.552
Get me contact!

41:01.522 --> 41:03.099
Okay.

41:03.123 --> 41:04.283
Look out!

41:06.026 --> 41:07.203
Come on.

41:07.227 --> 41:08.805
Here we go.

41:08.829 --> 41:10.106
All right.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.999
Come on. All right, Ziva,
here we go.

41:37.925 --> 41:39.950
Let's go home.

41:54.842 --> 41:57.072
Just another day at the office.
