00:11.713 --> 00:12.946
God!

00:12.981 --> 00:15.640
Some men find pregnant women sexy.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.466
Me? My penis is sad.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.149
Why isn't this working?

00:20.183 --> 00:21.545
I don't know. I think
I have to come first.

00:21.579 --> 00:22.875
I think you have
to have a bigger dick.

00:22.910 --> 00:24.476
Shut the fuck up!
Ah, yeah!

00:24.510 --> 00:27.042
There you go. Ah!
Ouch! Bent it.

00:28.877 --> 00:30.608
Fucking vagina is exploding!

00:30.642 --> 00:33.175
I appreciate it. I'll call you back.
All right, bye-bye.

00:34.515 --> 00:36.386
Honey, calm down, calm down, okay?

00:36.421 --> 00:39.892
Maybe you should've fucking
calmed down nine months ago

00:39.926 --> 00:42.362
and I would be closing on
the CEO of Lindsay Foods

00:42.396 --> 00:44.532
at 2:00 instead of trying
to pop out Marty Jr.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.535
out of the eye of a fucking needle!

00:48.205 --> 00:52.413
Oh, great. Now... now a
vulture is gonna swoop in

00:52.447 --> 00:54.350
and steal my golden egg!

00:54.384 --> 00:56.919
Fuck!

00:56.953 --> 00:58.354
Lindsay Phillips, please.
Kaan.

00:58.388 --> 00:59.921
Marty Kaan, Galweather Stearn.

00:59.956 --> 01:01.189
Fuck you!

01:01.223 --> 01:04.257
Yes, I heard that Kinsy had to cancel.

01:04.292 --> 01:08.194
- Pay...
- ...back is a bitch.

01:08.229 --> 01:10.029
Uh, is this cucumber in here?

01:10.064 --> 01:11.296
Yes. Do you like it?

01:11.331 --> 01:12.531
Yeah, it's great.

01:12.565 --> 01:13.765
Fuck off.

01:19.176 --> 01:21.210
Monica and I have always played dirty.

01:21.244 --> 01:24.415
How is scheduling a custody
mediation playing dirty?

01:24.449 --> 01:27.388
In the middle of the week
when I have an engagement

01:27.422 --> 01:29.057
and I gotta fly all the
way back here for it?

01:29.091 --> 01:30.725
She's trying to fuck with me.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.462
Or she really wants this to work out

01:32.496 --> 01:34.565
and she's trying to be
a real mom to Roscoe.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.269
She did give birth to him.
No, her vagina did.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.438
And if Monica wants custody
of everything that's been

01:39.473 --> 01:41.675
up in there...
She better not try to get

01:41.709 --> 01:43.111
custody of O'Henry on my watch.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.783
Ooh. You don't have
to call dibs.

01:46.817 --> 01:48.318
O'Henry loves Pinky Tuscadero.

01:48.352 --> 01:49.586
Mm-hmm.

01:57.297 --> 01:58.665
I love you.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.269
Relax. I just wanted
you to know.

02:02.304 --> 02:04.939
Take care of O'Henry for me.

02:04.974 --> 02:07.609
Mm-hmm.

02:13.183 --> 02:14.383
Hey!
Hey!

02:14.417 --> 02:15.717
Where ya headed, pal?

02:15.752 --> 02:17.119
Coffee.

02:17.153 --> 02:19.154
Oh, coffee?
Here, got it for you.

02:19.188 --> 02:21.323
You're welcome.
Let's turn around.

02:21.357 --> 02:22.657
By the way, enormous congrats

02:22.692 --> 02:25.059
landing this week's client.

02:25.094 --> 02:26.494
Mega church equals mega business.

02:26.529 --> 02:27.962
Yeah, can I tell you,
I am so amped about going

02:27.997 --> 02:29.697
to your hometown.
Spokane, right?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.499
It is Spokane! You
think we'll find

02:31.533 --> 02:33.567
any skeletons in the old Spokane closet?
Like what?

02:33.602 --> 02:35.136
Oh, if I could dream, secret sex tape?

02:35.170 --> 02:37.472
Yeah, secret love child with an uncle.

02:37.507 --> 02:40.042
Right. Or I don't know,
secret wedding.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.179
Oh, that's right.
We found out about the wedding.

02:46.217 --> 02:49.820
Officer Dangler.
Dick Dangler.

02:49.854 --> 02:51.889
Looking for a naughty bride.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.031 --> 03:02.265
Do you like him?
Because honestly,

03:02.300 --> 03:04.234
he was the most
expensive one they had.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.602
Marty told us about it last week,

03:05.636 --> 03:07.337
and we just wanted
to say big congrats.

03:07.371 --> 03:09.906
And you thought
having Officer Big Dick

03:09.940 --> 03:12.742
dry hump me in our office
was the best way to do that?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.877
Great. What'd I tell you?
She hates it. She loves it.

03:14.911 --> 03:16.579
Look at her. She hates it.
She loves it.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.381
Jeannie, I wanted
to get you a penis cake.

03:18.416 --> 03:21.852
Wh... I'll take the penis cake
as well.

03:21.887 --> 03:25.222
Chocolate, please?

03:25.257 --> 03:28.427
Well, looks like someone's gonna
have to take another trip

03:28.461 --> 03:30.562
down to the penis cake bakery, Doug.

03:30.596 --> 03:32.898
Well, what can I say?
They make great cakes.

03:34.434 --> 03:37.369
I hear your custody battle's
heating up.

03:37.404 --> 03:39.305
Fucking ex-wives.

03:39.339 --> 03:40.773
Well, the word "battle" makes it seem

03:40.807 --> 03:42.374
like Monica actually
has a chance in hell,

03:42.409 --> 03:44.544
which she doesn't,
so I'm good on that front.

03:44.578 --> 03:46.913
Now I'm just focusing on how

03:46.947 --> 03:49.249
to bust Skip's nut sack.

03:49.283 --> 03:50.483
The White Knight's looking good.

03:50.518 --> 03:53.053
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.

03:53.087 --> 03:54.821
But you know, come to think of it,

03:54.856 --> 03:56.089
fuck all that!

03:56.124 --> 03:57.424
You're the motherfucking Rainmaker.

03:57.458 --> 04:00.126
Fucking A!
I'm Marty goddamn Kaan.

04:00.161 --> 04:02.896
Yes, you are, motherfucker.
We <i>are</i> Galweather's relationships.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.764
How about we we urge our friends

04:04.798 --> 04:06.399
to threaten to leave Galweather? Yes.

04:06.433 --> 04:08.801
Shit this brick
right before the vote goes down

04:08.836 --> 04:10.803
leaving Skip no time to woo them back.

04:10.837 --> 04:13.573
Oh, that's making me so hard, Marty.

04:13.607 --> 04:15.408
Hey, thanks for tellin
the dildo twins.

04:15.443 --> 04:16.877
Hey.

04:19.047 --> 04:21.281
Sorry. Good morning.

04:21.315 --> 04:23.318
Good morning, potty mouth.

04:23.352 --> 04:25.587
You know, I'm sure Jeannie
is storming in here to tell me

04:25.621 --> 04:27.489
about landing her first whale. Really?

04:27.524 --> 04:29.325
Yeah, she just reeled in
a big one all by herself.

04:29.359 --> 04:33.429
Well, must be getting good
advice from someone.

04:33.464 --> 04:34.764
Yep.

04:34.798 --> 04:36.165
You know, Kinsley consultants

04:36.199 --> 04:38.934
has had a lot to say
about you, Jeannie.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.436
Oh.

04:41.471 --> 04:43.038
So good luck this week.

04:43.072 --> 04:45.207
Thank you.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.341
You never forget your first one.

04:47.376 --> 04:49.677
<i>So, Jeannie, why did we have</i>

04:49.711 --> 04:51.879
<i>to find out about Wes the hard way?</i>

04:51.913 --> 04:55.950
Dougie, Dougie, Jeannie
didn't tell us about Wes

04:55.984 --> 04:58.453
because a woman believes that
she has more power over a man

04:58.487 --> 05:00.388
if said man thinks that said
woman is still bangable.

05:00.422 --> 05:01.523
Right, Jeannie?

05:01.557 --> 05:03.892
That is incorrect. Yes.
Under your sway.

05:03.927 --> 05:07.063
That's not true.
Okay, I could get you guys to do anything:

05:07.097 --> 05:08.398
switch work streams,
prep the deck for me,

05:08.432 --> 05:11.167
That time I almost
got you two to kiss?

05:11.202 --> 05:13.470
That was me using my superpowers.

05:13.505 --> 05:15.806
That is fraud analysis.
We never kissed.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.042
No, men will do anything
for the unconquered pussy.

05:19.076 --> 05:21.144
All right, handle it, Hoovie.

05:21.178 --> 05:22.212
Shining Light Christian Center

05:22.246 --> 05:23.647
run by Reverend Thomas Tyler.

05:23.681 --> 05:25.481
So you dated a guy
who became a reverend.

05:25.516 --> 05:27.083
Just because I know him, I dated him?

05:27.117 --> 05:28.751
In my fantasy, yeah, you did.

05:28.785 --> 05:30.519
Also in my fantasy, she's wearing

05:30.553 --> 05:32.887
this schoolgirl outfit that's insane.

05:32.922 --> 05:34.255
Yes!
Dirty girl.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.757
It's too small for you. Excuse me.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.926
Why don't you wear underwear?
Okay, I'm right here.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.995
And the pigtails.
She's been a naughty...

05:40.029 --> 05:42.497
You were naughty. All right.
Go, go. Give us a taste.

05:42.531 --> 05:44.866
He did used to sniff my hair
in Sex Ed.

05:46.269 --> 05:48.670
Dude was kinda obsessed
with the Van Der <i>Hooven.</i>

05:48.704 --> 05:50.371
I'd jump in there if you let me.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.106
Well, now he's all about
business and God.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.075
Shining Light saw its revenues plummet

05:54.110 --> 05:55.376
by over $10 million last year,

05:55.411 --> 05:57.946
so our job is to turn

05:57.980 --> 06:01.049
that end-state vision
around by energizing revenues

06:01.083 --> 06:03.518
and leaning hard
on a massive brand repo.

06:03.553 --> 06:05.554
He wants to be the next
Joel Osteen celebrity preacher.

06:05.588 --> 06:08.357
But?
But...

06:08.391 --> 06:10.726
the al bogey is to leverage
this engagement

06:10.760 --> 06:14.863
to get Galweather a nice big fat
slice of that mega church pie.

06:14.898 --> 06:17.433
You know, God, Inc. is
the new rock and roll.

06:17.467 --> 06:20.736
Yes, and Joel Osteen is fricking Bono.

06:20.770 --> 06:24.073
New frontier.
Tell you what, kid.

06:24.107 --> 06:26.308
You hit nothing but neon this one,

06:26.343 --> 06:28.811
you will be the stuff of legend.

06:28.845 --> 06:31.280
Mmm, can I get an amen?!

06:31.314 --> 06:33.348
<i>Amen!</i>

06:34.650 --> 06:37.453
Jeannie Van Der Hooven!

06:37.487 --> 06:39.754
Oh!

06:41.156 --> 06:42.390
Hmm.

06:43.659 --> 06:45.093
Whoops.

06:45.127 --> 06:47.595
Okay.

06:47.629 --> 06:49.664
Just like 1997, huh?

06:51.167 --> 06:52.901
It's good to see you.

06:52.936 --> 06:54.403
Thomas is a wonderful pastor,

06:54.437 --> 06:57.473
and our church has grown
so very, very fast.

06:57.508 --> 07:00.410
But, and there's always a but.

07:00.444 --> 07:02.279
We have held steady at 50,000 members

07:02.313 --> 07:03.681
of our flock in recent years

07:03.715 --> 07:06.083
and another quarter-million
between the six churches

07:06.118 --> 07:08.286
in our Shining Light family,
but we've leveraged up

07:08.320 --> 07:10.288
inside the bubble and we need

07:10.323 --> 07:12.358
to convince the board
to spend more in order

07:12.392 --> 07:13.959
to attract new members.

07:13.994 --> 07:15.594
If we can't get the board

07:15.628 --> 07:17.329
to invest in new membership,

07:19.365 --> 07:20.998
Old Testament stuff, huh?

07:21.033 --> 07:22.133
Fire and brimstone.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.101
We need you guys to present the board

07:24.136 --> 07:26.270
with a comprehensive media package

07:26.304 --> 07:29.472
and a viable
business model. Okay?

07:29.507 --> 07:33.109
Yeah? And you have my complete
support with the board.

07:33.143 --> 07:35.311
It's what we do.

07:35.346 --> 07:36.613
Amen.
Amen.

07:36.647 --> 07:39.015
Amen.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.053
I can't say it,
I'm Jewish. Amen.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.655
Here's the church.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.457
Here's the steeple.

07:46.491 --> 07:48.626
Open the doors, Tammy
Faye wants some people.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.628
Clyde, do a dirty performance
improvement diagnostic.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.497
Oh, no, no.

07:52.531 --> 07:55.200
Your superpowers
no longer work on me, woman.

07:56.702 --> 07:57.903
Okay.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.171
What?

07:59.205 --> 08:01.173
It's nothing.

08:03.410 --> 08:04.577
Shit.

08:04.612 --> 08:06.713
Potty mouth, party of one.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.982
Jeannie, we're in a church.

08:09.016 --> 08:10.651
Then say a prayer for me because

08:10.685 --> 08:12.019
there's my mother.

08:12.053 --> 08:13.286
Hello, Mama.

08:14.889 --> 08:18.057
One word about my engagement,
and I will cut off O'Henry,

08:18.091 --> 08:19.758
Supa-Dupa and Knight Rider,
and I will throw them

08:19.793 --> 08:21.393
in a Mexican dogfight.

08:21.427 --> 08:24.496
And if she invites you
to dinner, you know what to say.

08:24.530 --> 08:26.698
<i>- Mmm.
- Phoebe, dinner smells delicious.</i>

08:26.732 --> 08:28.366
Let me tell you something
about this woman.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.934
She is naughty!
She's hilarious.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.369
You didn't tell me
your mom was so funny.

08:32.404 --> 08:33.370
Oh, Jeannie doesn't like my jokes.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.672
She says they're dirty.

08:34.706 --> 08:36.373
They are dirty.
Especially the one...

08:36.408 --> 08:38.208
Okay, Mom, I work with
these people, so don't...

08:38.243 --> 08:41.044
Jeannie's always so touchy.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.380
Oh, nothing wrong with being touchy.

08:42.414 --> 08:43.849
Oh, she's so touchy, right?

08:43.883 --> 08:45.884
What else is she, huh?
What else?

08:45.918 --> 08:48.053
Uh, let me tell you what else she is.

08:48.088 --> 08:50.523
She is, uh, Junior Miss Spokane 2002.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.091
Hello.

08:52.126 --> 08:53.726
You must be so proud.

08:53.761 --> 08:55.895
Is that real?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

08:55.929 --> 08:57.396
Jeannie, baby, pop me
one of these waves.

08:57.431 --> 08:58.698
Hit me with one of the...
Or you know what?

08:58.732 --> 09:00.233
Maybe pop on the crown?

09:00.267 --> 09:01.534
Oh, I'll pop it somewhere all right.

09:02.903 --> 09:05.304
Jeannie worked the circuit for years.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.206
Is that right? Mm-hmm. Oh, my God.

09:07.241 --> 09:09.209
Phoebe, I can't believe I'm
about to share this with you.

09:09.243 --> 09:10.743
I actually did beauty
pageants myself. Oh!

09:10.777 --> 09:12.144
What a coincidence. So did I.

09:12.179 --> 09:13.713
Yeah, well, I was crowned king

09:13.747 --> 09:14.981
17 times in a row.
Well, I won

09:15.015 --> 09:16.882
most flair in Little Prince Charming.

09:16.917 --> 09:18.317
I don't believe that.

09:18.351 --> 09:20.052
Well, I coached the hell
out of Jeannie.

09:20.086 --> 09:22.087
Oh.
And she was

09:22.122 --> 09:24.088
the sexiest little kid on that stage.

09:24.123 --> 09:25.223
"Sexy" seems like the wrong word.

09:25.257 --> 09:28.092
Then she just up and quit.

09:28.127 --> 09:29.995
I didn't quit.
I got into Columbia.

09:30.029 --> 09:31.562
So tell me about L.A.

09:31.597 --> 09:33.264
I mean, I'm always
threatening to visit,

09:33.298 --> 09:34.498
but she's always saying no.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.933
Well, I'm never home.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.769
I travel all the time for work.

09:38.803 --> 09:40.771
You know, guys, I was
happily married at her age.

09:40.806 --> 09:42.106
Oh, too bad.

09:42.141 --> 09:45.809
What... whatever
happened to that Wes?

09:45.843 --> 09:47.912
I told you-- we broke up.

09:47.946 --> 09:50.481
"Broke up."

09:50.515 --> 09:51.749
I just saw him when I...

09:51.783 --> 09:53.150
Yeah, no, the breakup.

09:53.184 --> 09:55.085
I remember that now.
That was tough for you.

09:55.119 --> 09:56.686
Good thing is, though, uh,

09:56.721 --> 09:58.488
she's killing it at work.

09:58.522 --> 09:59.923
She is on the fast track to partner.

09:59.957 --> 10:01.591
Well, Jeannie always
gets what she wants.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.125
She's just like her daddy.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.494
Where is Daddy now, Mom?
Huh?

10:05.528 --> 10:07.362
Where is he?

10:07.396 --> 10:09.197
Well, you know your father

10:09.231 --> 10:10.465
works late.

10:10.499 --> 10:12.433
He really wanted to meet your friends.

10:12.468 --> 10:13.768
Oh, next time.
Mmm.

10:13.802 --> 10:15.670
Right.
My dad works late a lot.

10:15.704 --> 10:17.138
Uh, he's also out of town a lot.

10:17.172 --> 10:20.208
'Cause he travels for business.

10:20.243 --> 10:22.645
A lot.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.280
He's always fond of

10:24.314 --> 10:26.783
been a bit elusive that way.

10:26.817 --> 10:28.051
Right, Mom?

10:31.055 --> 10:33.490
Well, I think I'll go
check on the chicken.

10:33.525 --> 10:34.992
Okay.
Mmm.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.360
Yeah, you do that.

10:52.876 --> 10:54.543
Hello?

10:54.577 --> 10:56.545
Who's in here?

10:57.747 --> 10:59.181
Jeannie...

10:59.215 --> 11:01.083
Van Der Hooven.

11:01.117 --> 11:03.352
Why do you always say my full name?

11:03.386 --> 11:05.521
Oh!

11:07.724 --> 11:09.892
Wow. Thou shan't fuck thy
secretary after all. Oh, wow.

11:09.926 --> 11:11.160
Uh...

11:11.194 --> 11:13.262
Sniffing more than hair
these days, huh?

11:13.296 --> 11:16.332
Yeah, I'm going to need you
to put that away.

11:17.768 --> 11:19.569
Yeah, this is, uh, just a...

11:19.603 --> 11:20.870
a one-time thing.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.572
Swear to... swear to God.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.075
You know, my wife,
she-she...

11:25.109 --> 11:26.844
all she cares about is Shining Light

11:26.878 --> 11:30.348
and business and being a
celeb preacher's wife.

11:30.383 --> 11:32.450
She's completely...

11:32.485 --> 11:34.520
abandoned our marriage.

11:34.554 --> 11:37.556
You know, maybe I should have
married someone like you.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.024
You know, I have always liked you,

11:39.058 --> 11:41.526
Miss Junior Miss Spokane 2002.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.894
All right, you're kind
of getting off track here.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.465
The point is, I have needs.

11:48.101 --> 11:50.102
A man of God is still just a man.

11:50.136 --> 11:52.937
Oh, you poor guy.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.475
Choose your dick or God.

12:07.752 --> 12:10.053
Uh, Mr. Kaan.
Heard you had to fly in.

12:10.087 --> 12:12.055
What, you think I'd miss
this party? Are you nuts?

12:12.089 --> 12:14.157
Uh, well, then,

12:14.191 --> 12:15.258
Mr. Kaan,
Ms. Talbot,

12:15.292 --> 12:16.960
the intention of this afternoon

12:16.995 --> 12:18.395
is to reach a settlement.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.564
No lawyers; just
working it out

12:20.599 --> 12:24.068
in a reasonable fashion--
two concerned parents.

12:24.102 --> 12:26.238
- Where's the other concerned parent?
Marty-pants...

12:26.272 --> 12:29.275
he is my son, too.
ah, you just

12:29.309 --> 12:31.244
figure that shit out
after eight, nine years?

12:31.278 --> 12:33.446
Yeah, you fucking crackhead.
Why don't you take

12:33.480 --> 12:34.948
the pipe out of your
mouth? Figure that out.

12:34.982 --> 12:36.816
Do you... do you see
what I'm dealing with here?

12:36.851 --> 12:38.084
O-o-okay. Such anger.

12:38.118 --> 12:39.118
Uh, Ms. Talbot,

12:39.153 --> 12:40.353
you requested this mediation.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.188
Why don't you go first and...

12:42.222 --> 12:44.590
Equal time.
I want equal time.

12:44.624 --> 12:47.526
Oh, a 50-50 split.
No. Not gonna happen.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.294
We're not going to have him
living out of a suitcase

12:49.328 --> 12:51.196
while he's shuttling
back and forth between my house

12:51.230 --> 12:52.697
and fucking Cruella de Vil's mansion.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.932
Uh-uh, not split weeks;
I want years.

12:54.967 --> 12:57.134
Mr. Kaan has had Roscoe
for five years.

12:57.169 --> 12:59.537
I want Roscoe for five years.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.139
Uh, that's a...
a little different than...

13:02.174 --> 13:04.274
what we had discussed.
I don't care.

13:04.309 --> 13:06.443
You're not even here half the time.

13:06.477 --> 13:08.178
Oh, I've also requested

13:08.212 --> 13:09.979
a long-term engagement
here in Los Angeles.

13:10.014 --> 13:12.348
You can write that.

13:12.382 --> 13:13.950
I'm actually going to be home
more than you.

13:13.984 --> 13:16.319
Yeah, well, you're still
going to be you.

13:16.353 --> 13:18.388
You know, narcissistic,

13:18.423 --> 13:19.890
fucking burnout,
pill-popping...

13:19.924 --> 13:21.458
Oh, again with the drug...

13:21.492 --> 13:23.961
Don't write that down.
It... you know what?

13:23.995 --> 13:29.333
I am addicted to many things,
but drugs is not one of them.

13:30.736 --> 13:32.504
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

13:32.538 --> 13:35.540
How's O'Henry?
Henry? Uh, who's Henry?

13:35.574 --> 13:37.142
O'Henry. It's my dick.

13:37.176 --> 13:39.510
And her foot is rubbing it right now.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.148
You are very fucked-up.

13:44.182 --> 13:45.983
You kind of like it.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.318
Is-is... is it still there?

13:48.352 --> 13:49.886
Yes.

13:49.921 --> 13:51.821
Uh, okay, well, then, uh,

13:51.855 --> 13:54.257
I think I'm going to, uh, leave the...

13:54.291 --> 13:56.593
the two of you alone for a moment,

13:56.628 --> 14:00.598
and, uh, I'll be...
I'll be right... right back.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.874
You can't win this thing.

14:08.908 --> 14:12.511
I've made mistakes with Roscoe
that I can't make better,

14:12.545 --> 14:14.580
but I still have time to fix it.

14:14.614 --> 14:17.249
You know what it's like
to grow up and miss your mom.

14:19.552 --> 14:21.519
You hear yourself?

14:21.554 --> 14:23.121
You can't help it, Monica.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.689
You're empty.

14:24.723 --> 14:27.358
You can't fill that shit up.
Maybe.

14:27.392 --> 14:29.893
Do you remember when we
found out that I was pregnant?

14:32.463 --> 14:34.898
I wanted this little boy, too.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.605
And I...

14:41.639 --> 14:43.808
I wanted...

14:55.454 --> 14:57.989
Can we just stop being so serious?

15:00.692 --> 15:03.393
Come on.

15:03.428 --> 15:05.762
♪ Oh, I feel... ♪

15:05.797 --> 15:07.330
Come on.
♪ Spent ♪

15:09.366 --> 15:12.001
♪ So fast, so fast ♪

15:16.339 --> 15:18.173
♪ So fast. ♪

15:21.111 --> 15:22.912
Uh...

15:22.946 --> 15:26.649
Listen, uh,
about last night--

15:26.683 --> 15:30.419
Suzanne is kind of suspicious.

15:30.454 --> 15:31.954
She thought she saw
some lipstick on me,

15:31.988 --> 15:34.089
so I kind of told her
that I was working late

15:34.124 --> 15:35.791
with you and you accidently

15:35.826 --> 15:38.093
brushed up against me, so...

15:39.962 --> 15:42.263
Jesus, I suck at fornicating.

15:42.298 --> 15:44.265
The dick is closed for business.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.134
Thomas?
Yes.

15:46.168 --> 15:47.602
They're ready to go over

15:47.637 --> 15:48.937
your light cues for Sunday morning.

15:50.373 --> 15:51.940
Righty, honey. I'll...

15:53.042 --> 15:54.442
Uh, this is...

15:54.477 --> 15:56.311
Bye. Bye, Jeannie.

16:01.985 --> 16:03.752
So...

16:06.156 --> 16:07.956
I've asked around about you,
and you...

16:07.991 --> 16:10.225
were a little fast
in the panties back in the day.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.695
Hmm? So...
I guess I'll let you

16:12.729 --> 16:15.498
prep for tomorrow, yeah?

16:16.533 --> 16:18.334
Oh, the board can be

16:18.368 --> 16:20.236
a prickly bunch, but I'm sure

16:20.271 --> 16:21.971
it'll all go according to God's plan.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.673
Amen.

16:25.509 --> 16:27.109
Hmm.

16:29.513 --> 16:31.180
Amen.

16:31.214 --> 16:33.849
Hey, baby.

16:33.884 --> 16:35.717
Yeah, I, uh...

16:35.752 --> 16:38.154
thought I was going
to have time to come back,

16:38.188 --> 16:40.423
but I just had to go
right into the mediation.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.358
Yeah, I'm at the airport now.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.759
Ha.

16:46.096 --> 16:47.863
Yeah, I love you, too.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.100
I'll call you when I get there.

16:51.134 --> 16:52.668
Bye-bye.

16:56.374 --> 16:59.075
Hey, you guys are
getting serious, huh?

17:00.444 --> 17:02.445
It's such bullshit.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.781
This is your "save a ho" mode.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.249
I've seen it before,

17:06.282 --> 17:09.219
and trust me, it never ends well.

17:09.253 --> 17:13.557
Yeah, well, you're right.

17:13.592 --> 17:16.694
Damaged and unfixable--

17:16.728 --> 17:18.194
that used to be my type.

17:18.229 --> 17:19.563
But where did it get me?

17:19.597 --> 17:21.632
Right here, right?

17:21.665 --> 17:24.268
Having empty sex

17:24.303 --> 17:26.404
with a woman I never even
should have married.

17:27.772 --> 17:29.240
I love April.

17:30.442 --> 17:32.143
Roscoe loves her, too,

17:32.177 --> 17:33.712
and not just because he has to.

17:33.746 --> 17:35.113
It's good.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.116
Uh, Mr. Kaan?

17:38.151 --> 17:39.384
Ms. Talbot?

17:39.419 --> 17:42.354
I got to catch a flight.

17:48.762 --> 17:50.997
We were just looking for you.

17:51.031 --> 17:53.766
We are ready if the board is.

17:53.801 --> 17:56.168
Well, Jeannie, we have been thinking.
Praying.

17:56.203 --> 17:58.504
Yes, praying, and we just don't feel

17:58.538 --> 18:00.673
that you and your team
are just a good fit

18:00.707 --> 18:02.508
for Shining Light.

18:02.543 --> 18:05.177
Right, Thomas? Yeah.
You're right.

18:05.212 --> 18:07.579
I had a feeling
that you might say that.

18:07.614 --> 18:10.782
Well, you can take the girl
out of Spokane, but...

18:12.952 --> 18:15.154
You're right about that.
Okay, so, uh,

18:15.188 --> 18:17.256
we should just go?
Yeah, I think that's best.

18:17.291 --> 18:18.791
I'll probably...
I'm just going to...

18:18.825 --> 18:20.827
And I'll explain to the
board about your absence,

18:20.861 --> 18:23.330
and I'll make it discreet.

18:23.364 --> 18:26.367
You are a blessing.
Ah.

18:26.401 --> 18:29.470
Well, we're ready if you're
ready for the presentation.

18:29.505 --> 18:31.272
Um, actually we're, uh, we're leaving.

18:31.307 --> 18:33.275
What are you talking about?

18:33.309 --> 18:35.277
Some things happened
while you were away.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.446
And...

18:37.481 --> 18:40.149
And I messed up.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.887
So...

18:44.922 --> 18:46.022
So let's go.

18:46.056 --> 18:48.491
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's hit it.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.493
Wait a minute. What are we going
to do about Nick Peterman, though?

18:50.528 --> 18:52.329
What are you talking about?

18:52.363 --> 18:53.530
Nick Peterman of Peterman Media.

18:53.564 --> 18:55.298
We need to be careful.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.867
Since he is one of
Galweather's biggest clients.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.837
He's already agreed
to fly into Spokane.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.907
I don't know how much time we have.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.543
I guess we just should promise to
partner him with another client.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.978
Oh, this would have been
such a great marriage,

19:06.012 --> 19:07.212
Mm-hmm.
but...

19:07.247 --> 19:08.814
I know.
So...

19:08.849 --> 19:11.417
your firm handles Peterman Media?
Mm-hmm.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.752
Yeah.
Oh.

19:12.786 --> 19:14.220
Yeah, they were interested

19:14.254 --> 19:16.522
in getting into faith-based
content, so I pitched them

19:16.556 --> 19:17.689
a partnership with Shining Light.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.824
He was very excited.
Oh.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.325
We started talking about

19:20.359 --> 19:22.226
TV ministry, books,
reality TV and this and that.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.595
He thinks you guys are going
to be the next Osteen, but...

19:24.629 --> 19:26.397
Jeannie, this is
a done deal. Let's...

19:28.132 --> 19:31.234
Listen, I do want to say before
we leave, I really am sorry.

19:31.268 --> 19:35.104
And I'm sorry for her as well.
You know what?

19:35.139 --> 19:36.673
If Nick is flying in right now,

19:36.707 --> 19:38.241
we can take a meeting with him.

19:38.276 --> 19:40.410
Take that long.
We can...

19:40.445 --> 19:42.079
Probably couldn't hurt.

19:42.113 --> 19:44.281
Yeah.
Yeah. Let's do it.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.750
Yeah, let's do it, guys.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.685
Nick, thanks again for flying in.

19:47.719 --> 19:51.022
I think Shining Light
is the perfect investment.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.224
And I will be your primary.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.426
Yes, me, too.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.963
Okay. Yeah, I'm glad
we could we make the deal.

19:58.997 --> 20:01.832
All right. Okay, bye.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.369
You are really good at your job.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.038
That is because my job

20:07.072 --> 20:09.206
requires me to lie, Mom.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.609
Something I perfected
a long time ago, right?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.244
I never asked you to lie, Jeannie.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.547
You did. You did.

20:16.581 --> 20:19.417
And you still want to keep doing it.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.788
But I... can't.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.828
I didn't break up with Wes.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.497
We're engaged.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.632
The wedding is in two months

20:34.666 --> 20:36.834
and I didn't tell you because

20:36.868 --> 20:41.438
I don't want us to do the whole
"Why isn't Daddy around?" dance

20:41.473 --> 20:44.108
that we've been doing
for the last 16 years.

20:44.142 --> 20:47.011
We have to lie and pretend

20:47.045 --> 20:50.614
about every goddamn thing.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.783
About how he hurt you.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.519
About how he hurt me...

20:57.221 --> 20:59.123
...when he left.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.625
But people talk, Mom.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.129
People fucking know
that Daddy wasn't at work, okay?

21:05.164 --> 21:08.332
And no matter how many
pageants you made me do,

21:08.367 --> 21:09.867
people still knew, okay?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.270
We were still the same fucking family.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.440
And I am done pretending.
I'm done.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.375
But you keep going, okay?

21:17.409 --> 21:19.076
You have a blast.

21:27.084 --> 21:29.352
Monica.
Awkward.

21:29.387 --> 21:32.688
Nobody's here but me.

21:32.722 --> 21:35.223
So where's the old man?

21:35.258 --> 21:38.660
Jeremiah is with your son.

21:38.695 --> 21:40.696
It's Thursday.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.364
Roscoe has dance.

21:42.398 --> 21:44.333
Everybody knows Roscoe has dance.

21:44.367 --> 21:47.336
Oh, aren't you the happy
little homemaker.

21:47.370 --> 21:50.872
What can I do for you, Monica?

21:50.907 --> 21:54.543
Well, I think you've heard
some bad things about me.

21:54.578 --> 21:56.578
And some of them might be true.

21:56.613 --> 21:58.414
I'm not perfect.

21:58.448 --> 22:01.017
But then neither are
you, though, right?

22:01.051 --> 22:04.487
Yeah, Marty ran a hypothetical
past a friend of ours--

22:04.521 --> 22:07.023
lawyer.

22:07.058 --> 22:08.492
GHB can be tricky.

22:08.526 --> 22:11.261
I don't like
to be fucked with, Monica.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.364
I bite, too.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.499
Well, I want to be friends.
I'm here to be friends.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.834
I want to be a good mom

22:16.868 --> 22:18.336
to Roscoe.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.371
And I realize that
you're here to stay.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.439
That's right.
I am staying here.

22:22.473 --> 22:24.241
Indefinitely.

22:24.275 --> 22:29.079
And I knew it when I heard him
tell you that he loved you.

22:29.113 --> 22:31.615
And now that I know how serious
the both of you are,

22:31.649 --> 22:33.750
I will respect the fact

22:33.784 --> 22:36.686
that your place is here
with my husband.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.254
Oh, ex-husband.

22:38.288 --> 22:39.622
Habit.

22:43.159 --> 22:47.695
Whoo. Marty always did
love 'em feisty.

22:47.730 --> 22:52.867
Now believe me, from
here on out, hands off Marty.

22:52.901 --> 22:56.403
Yesterday was just a mistake.

23:10.452 --> 23:14.088

23:14.122 --> 23:18.125

Hey...

23:25.835 --> 23:30.172
great job on Shining Light.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.341
Thanks.

23:32.376 --> 23:35.777
Are you proud of me?

23:35.812 --> 23:38.580
Hey, come here.

23:38.615 --> 23:41.116
Of course I'm proud of you.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.468
Hey, baby.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.605
Crazy-ass week.

24:05.975 --> 24:08.678
Now I know why I hate church.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.815
How was mediation?

24:12.850 --> 24:14.817
Ridiculous.

24:14.852 --> 24:16.686
Yeah.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.388
Monica actually thinks she has
a shot of getting Roscoe back.

24:19.423 --> 24:21.557
She's delusional.

24:21.591 --> 24:24.794
Hmm. So you decided to fuck
some sense into her.

24:24.828 --> 24:26.896
Yeah?

24:31.902 --> 24:34.537
I got to say, Marty, you called it.

24:34.572 --> 24:37.374
You said she wanted
to fuck you in mediation,

24:37.408 --> 24:39.009
so you were right.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.680
Oh, come...

24:43.715 --> 24:47.083
April, stop, please.

24:47.118 --> 24:48.418
Don't pack?

24:48.453 --> 24:50.087
Oh, yeah, that's right.

24:50.121 --> 24:51.555
Let me... let me sit back

24:51.589 --> 24:54.057
and hear some of that Marty Kaan spin.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.026
Go on, sell me.

24:56.060 --> 24:57.427
Fucking sell me, Marty.

24:57.461 --> 25:00.664
No? Nothing?
I'll go for you.

25:00.698 --> 25:04.000
My name is Marty Kaan.

25:04.035 --> 25:07.604
And everything you thought
you knew about me, you don't.

25:10.608 --> 25:14.211
I am smarter than you, and
I will make you need me.

25:14.245 --> 25:15.679
And then I'll show you how

25:15.714 --> 25:18.182
I am completely
incapable of being loyal

25:18.216 --> 25:20.552
to anything or anyone but myself.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.721
I'll blow the fucking shit
out of any goddamn thing

25:22.755 --> 25:25.057
that could ever be
good for me in my life.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.226
What happen...

25:27.260 --> 25:28.461
What happened to the girl who's, like,

25:28.495 --> 25:30.463
here's my friend in Tampa,

25:30.498 --> 25:32.132
and I want you to have...?

25:32.166 --> 25:33.767
You're in the middle
of a custody battle

25:33.801 --> 25:35.369
and she's trying to take
your son from you.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.537
Who, by the way, deserves way
better than the two of you.

25:37.571 --> 25:39.305
And in the middle of that,

25:39.340 --> 25:41.574
your dick got hard.

25:41.609 --> 25:43.276
Who does that?!

25:43.310 --> 25:45.544
Me! I'm fucked up!

25:53.920 --> 25:55.654
I hate myself

25:55.688 --> 25:58.790
because I knew who you were...

25:58.825 --> 26:01.726
and I still fucking
fell for your shit.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.628
I guess that's 'cause I'm
fucked up, too, right, Marty?

26:03.663 --> 26:05.164
We all know that, I'm fucked up.

26:05.198 --> 26:07.065
You know what, you're more fucked up

26:07.099 --> 26:09.801
and you are way too fucked up for me.
April, please, please.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.937
Please, please,
please don't, just don't...

26:12.972 --> 26:17.441
Were you inside of her when
you told me you loved me?

26:17.476 --> 26:19.444
Huh?

26:19.478 --> 26:21.646
Aw.

26:24.949 --> 26:26.750
Over, right?

26:26.784 --> 26:29.919
Okay, so don't speak
to my son on the way out.

26:29.953 --> 26:31.754
Leave my key on the counter.

26:34.958 --> 26:36.025
Wow.

26:36.059 --> 26:40.130
Marty fucking Kaan.

26:40.164 --> 26:41.831
Oh...

26:41.866 --> 26:43.467
Oh.
