00:45.545 --> 00:47.422
Can you let the dog in?

00:53.803 --> 00:57.515
I know the allure of operating
one of these noble machines,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.225
but stop this instant!

01:05.565 --> 01:07.233
- Got him?
- Got him.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.076
Uh, don't got him.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.370
Then leave it to the professionals.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.042
Yeah! Look at us!

01:25.627 --> 01:28.213
Freeze, you pint-sized punks!

01:30.006 --> 01:31.925
You two take the gnomes
back to Trollmarket.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.053
We'll get Señor Uhl's truck back
before anyone notices...

01:35.136 --> 01:36.304
Oh, no.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.806
Hands where I can see 'em!

01:39.224 --> 01:43.102
Looks like your little prank
is gonna get you serving a little time.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.687
You wanna press charges?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.814
Hmm.

01:45.897 --> 01:52.445
No, I have something far worse
planned for them. Saturday detention.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.085
You never got detention
before you met this boy.

02:07.168 --> 02:11.089
Jim had nothing to do with this.
I can screw up on my own, you know.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.135
We'll talk about this later.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.553
I don't get it.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.389
Were you pulling a prank
to impress that girl Claire?

02:19.472 --> 02:22.851
I don't think Señor Uhl's truck
would impress anyone, Dr. L.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.728
You know, girls don't always fall
for the bad boys, Jim.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.859
- Sometimes, they appreciate chivalry.
- Uh, thanks for the dating advice, Mom.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.028
Oh. And try not to burgle any cars
on your way there.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.948
Catch you on the flip side, Dr. L.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.539
- Hey, ready to get this over with?
- Are you joking?

02:44.622 --> 02:48.793
We're spending an entire Saturday
without the slightest possibility

02:48.877 --> 02:50.503
of almost getting killed.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.380
This is a vacation.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.300
- I told you I don't need a ride!
- Yeah, love you too, pal.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.719
Is that Coach dropping off Steve?

02:57.802 --> 02:59.929
Great. Vacation canceled.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.557
There are no cell phones allowed.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.686
You can survive without your texts,
and your apps and your beepy-boops.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.564
Your facey-spaces and tweety flaps.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.274
What?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.902
Nein! For your transgressions,

03:13.985 --> 03:16.362
you are to do homework
the entire duration.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.658
- What if I already did my homework?
- You will sit and stare at the wall.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.621
You will not leave this room. If I find
one of you has left without permission,

03:24.704 --> 03:26.331
then you will all face punishment.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.458
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.003
What is that, Mr. Domzalski?

03:32.086 --> 03:35.715
Oh, this?
Uh, a Diablo Maximus Breakfast Burrito.

03:35.798 --> 03:39.802
Ah. Diablo Maximus
Breakfast Burrito.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.763
- Smells delicious.
- It's my favorite.

03:41.846 --> 03:45.433
Oh, your favorite, you say?
You steal my favorite truck...

03:45.516 --> 03:49.479
- Uh...
- ...I steal your favorite burrito.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.357
As they say, fair play is turnabout.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.400
Detention will start now!

04:00.031 --> 04:01.699
I eat when I'm worried.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.076
Now I can't do that.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.994
Curse you, Señor Uhl.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.623
Diablo Maximus Breakfast Burrito. Hmm.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.334
I feel guilty sitting here
when there's a chance Gunmar's out.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.212
Look, Blinky and Aaarrrgghh!!!
are already looking into it.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.257
Without proof that
Gunmar really escaped,

04:17.339 --> 04:19.634
there's no point causing a panic
in Trollmarket.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.806
Mind your own business.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.684
Mind your own face, buttsnack.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.896
Since when are you
and Dumbledork such besties?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.400
Oh, what? No, we're not besties!
Ew! That guy? No!

04:37.986 --> 04:39.988
It can't be that spicy.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.365
It is that spicy!

04:42.448 --> 04:45.410
It took three years to build up
the tolerance for a single bite,

04:45.493 --> 04:48.246
and he’s harfing it down in one go!

04:48.329 --> 04:49.706
Hmm.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.542
Ah. Das gut.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.212
Oof. Oh.
Got a bit of a kick, ja?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.632
Ugh. Good hit, Steve.
Way to protect our cover.

04:59.716 --> 05:04.095
I'm starting to think Jim and the others
aren't here on official business.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.807
Wait, are you saying we gave ourselves
detention for nothing?

05:07.890 --> 05:11.936
Why is everyone gossiping,
and not gossiping with me?

05:12.020 --> 05:16.024
Oh, my gosh. Are they
gossiping about me?

05:16.107 --> 05:18.484
- I'll gossip with you, Mary.
- Shut up, Shannon.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.529
Stop squabbling!
From now on, not another word!

05:23.781 --> 05:25.408
Oh.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.743
Ay-yi-yi! Oh!

05:28.745 --> 05:33.791
My Underlord, the Pale Lady
has blessed me with another vision.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.754
The surface on fire. A war.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.257
When the flames die out, darkness.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.342
Only you remain.

05:43.426 --> 05:48.264
- And the flesh child?
- He has many friends who protect him.

05:48.347 --> 05:52.894
Before the Trollhunter succumbs,
you must lay waste to his guard.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.480
That is exactly the plan
that I have set out.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.900
This is not prophecy. It is plagiarism!

05:58.983 --> 06:04.322
How dare you besmirch
the Pale Lady's wisdom?

06:05.156 --> 06:07.533
Sire, you must be hungry.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.703
We have prepared a feast of Siamese...

06:10.787 --> 06:11.913
Cats?

06:11.996 --> 06:15.833
All you have to offer is cats
and empty words.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.795
- Wait, My Lord.
- You mustn't leave.

06:18.878 --> 06:25.009
Ugh! You may advise me,
but I take orders from no one.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.097
Hmm.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.933
Hmm.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.936
Queen Usurna
demands to see the Trollhunter.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.397
And I’ve demanded a pair
of reading glasses.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.858
- But has anyone dared to craft those?
- Hardly.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.695
It has come to her attention
that Blood Goblins and gruesomes

06:44.779 --> 06:47.073
have been sighted in Arcadia.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.783
What? Why did you tell her, Vendel?

06:48.866 --> 06:52.537
I didn't. I wasn't even aware
of these developments.

06:52.620 --> 06:57.041
She also knows that the Bridge
was left unguarded

06:57.125 --> 06:58.459
during your rescue mission.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.836
She knows a lot.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.380
So, it is true.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.678
Whoever is telling Usurna these things
isn't important.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.639
What matters is she's making a case
to prove a conspiracy.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.057
Before this blows up...

07:13.141 --> 07:15.560
...I suggest you retrieve
the Trollhunter.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.855
And while you're at it, find my staff.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.528
I shall return to the forest
for any evidence of Gunmar I may find.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.612
How ironic.

07:26.696 --> 07:31.409
After all of this,
I have become part of a conspiracy.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.368
Mm.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.581
Ugh!

07:36.664 --> 07:38.624
He hasn't been back in a while.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.127
- You think something happened?
- Like what exactly?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.087
You know something we don't?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.798
- Where are you going?
- Just to see where he went.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.759
- We're not supposed to leave.
- I'm just peeking my head out.

07:49.510 --> 07:53.055
Whoa! Ooh. Too spicy!

07:54.557 --> 07:58.519
- It's like a broken yogurt machine.
- Ew!

07:58.603 --> 08:02.398
Sounds like lasagna
getting shot out of a T-shirt cannon.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.192
That burrito had
three ghost peppers in it.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.986
Too much spice
for his delicate Austrian stomach.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.239
- He could be in there all day.
- All day?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.157
Ugh!

09:02.959 --> 09:03.960
Yeah!

09:29.902 --> 09:31.696
Set them free.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.949
Hmm.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.126
So, it is true.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.147
So, you are out.

10:06.230 --> 10:11.986
And you are a long way from Trollmarket.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.444
You should've run.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.906
I do not run. I am Draal.

10:56.989 --> 11:01.619
Protector of James Lake,
the Bular Slayer.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.037
Protector of Jim?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.083
Hmm.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.970
Who else could have told Queen Usurna
of our recent escapades?

11:20.054 --> 11:23.015
Listen, Mr. More-Eyes-Than-Brains.
I ain't no snitch.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.685
If it wasn't you, then how does Usurna
have such intimate knowledge

11:26.769 --> 11:28.354
of our undoings?

11:28.437 --> 11:31.357
Whoa, ixnay on the Queen-say.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.443
Ah, Queen Usurna.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.571
To what do we owe the
exquisite pleasure?

11:37.655 --> 11:40.866
I demand the Trollhunter.
You cannot hide the human forever.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.703
Master Jim had academic matters
of the utmost importance to attend.

11:44.787 --> 11:48.874
The Trollhunter has until sundown
to surrender himself to the Tribunal,

11:48.958 --> 11:52.711
or we'll have no choice
but to issue a warrant for his arrest.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.716
Wow, what cat peed in her corn flakes?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.429
Ten seconds.

12:01.512 --> 12:06.392
Clock is ticking. Uh, dekes left,
dekes right. Palchuk. For the win.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.937
Oh, Jim fouls him!

12:10.020 --> 12:12.940
Boo, Jim! Boo!

12:13.023 --> 12:16.902
So is it true? Did you guys
really steal Señor Uhl’s truck?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.362
Technically, we didn’t steal it.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.489
- We were just, uh... uh...
- Yeah.

12:20.573 --> 12:25.035
- Uh, we were...
- Guys, this town is a snoozefest.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.205
Nothing ever happens here.
What else did they expect us to do?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.415
Read a book?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.585
I mean, come on.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.003
What about you, Mare?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.421
My only crime was love.

12:35.504 --> 12:39.967
Miss Janeth caught me making out under
the bleachers with Tight Jeans Hank.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.846
Why would you make out with someone
from our rival school?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.223
He's forbidden fruit.
You wouldn't understand.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.644
- Is there anyone you haven't kissed?
- Jealous?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.605
What freshman did you beat up
to wind up here?

12:52.688 --> 12:55.566
What? What makes you think
I beat someone up, huh?

12:55.649 --> 12:58.360
Ever consider maybe
I'm not just a bully?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.404
That maybe I can be a good guy?

13:00.488 --> 13:03.073
Says the student
currently serving detention.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.951
Burn!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.829
I don't know why we have to be so mean
to each other.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.582
You know, everyone goes through stuff.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.375
So we act out.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.878
Only reason we're here is...

13:15.961 --> 13:18.672
'cause we weren't smart enough
to get away with it.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.843
We should be nicer.
I mean... who are we kidding?

13:22.927 --> 13:25.095
None of us are perfect.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.182
The least we can do
is to be honest for once.

13:28.265 --> 13:33.145
Maybe then we can help each other out,
you know? Make this world tolerable.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.439
What are you in here for?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.649
Embezzlement.

13:36.732 --> 13:40.110
Apparently there are limits to my power
as Student Body Treasurer.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.823
And the game is over!

13:44.907 --> 13:47.868
Jim's booed out of the stadium.

13:47.952 --> 13:52.706
He'll never feel happiness again!
Boo-hoo-hoo!

13:52.790 --> 13:55.960
- "Oh, no. My life is terrible!"
- Ugh.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.463
It's almost 3:00. We better head
back to class before Uhl returns.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.883
"I only know lows. I don't know highs."

14:02.967 --> 14:04.134
Psst, Master Jim.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.970
Uh... I'll catch up with you guys.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.888
I just gotta tie my shoes.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.017
Oh! He dunks on Jim!

14:12.101 --> 14:14.311
What are you doing here?

14:14.395 --> 14:18.190
Usurna plans to interrogate you
about inconsistencies in our stories.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.987
Don't worry. I have a foolproof plan.
We'll lie like the wind.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.406
- No Blood Goblins.
- Exactly.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.367
We'll say the Blood Goblins
were of a local variety.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.828
- And the gruesome was a lost...
- Tourist.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.080
Yes. And as for Draal
leaving his post...

14:33.163 --> 14:36.041
She knows Draal left his post?

14:36.125 --> 14:41.171
No, I should just be honest for once.
I need to tell Queen Usurna everything.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.631
I'd rather she hear it from me.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.217
No! We were the ones
who plotted this rescue mission.

14:45.301 --> 14:50.389
Which you only had to do because I chose
to go into the Darklands alone.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.850
Any consequences should fall on me.

14:52.933 --> 14:56.145
You will be admitting to treason
against Trollmarket.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.147
I'm still the Trollhunter.

14:58.230 --> 15:02.443
I stand by my actions even if the
Tribunal doesn't understand them.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.371
- Where'd he go?
- Quick. Back to class!

15:16.248 --> 15:17.249
Ouch!

15:20.169 --> 15:23.339
Oh, I can't feel my lips.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.095
How are we supposed to get
to the classroom now?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.555
We can cut through the cafeteria.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.975
- Wait, where's Jim?
- Jim's probably already there. Come on!

15:36.685 --> 15:37.519
Oh!

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
"Jim's already there"? Yeah, right.

15:39.813 --> 15:43.651
- Time for some Creepslayerz recon?
- I'll hunt down Jim.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.945
You keep the plebes in the dark.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.571
Then it's set.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.783
When I get outta here, I'll go straight
to Trollmarket to tell Usurna everything.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.494
Draal?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.329
You scared the great morkus out of us.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.997
What's Draal doing here?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.627
Why is he charging at us?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.339
Not Draal anymore!

16:06.757 --> 16:08.467
He has been touched by
the Decimaar Blade.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.471
The Decimaar Blade? Then Gunmar is out.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.849
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

16:18.769 --> 16:19.979
Get down!

16:22.731 --> 16:25.275
Milk! Milk! Where do they keep the milk?

16:25.359 --> 16:27.319
Ah!

16:32.533 --> 16:35.160
What? No. They left the room!

16:37.496 --> 16:38.831
That was too close.

16:38.914 --> 16:43.335
- Wait. Now where is Steve?
- Probably back in the room with Jim.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.504
Come on! No time to waste!

16:50.634 --> 16:52.720
Draal, you are being controlled.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.847
He cannot hear you, Master Jim.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.727
Dark magic too strong!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.648
Steve? Is that you?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.276
It's Uhl, the Unforgiving!

17:07.358 --> 17:09.903
Eli? Who's behind here?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.698
Do I hear fighting? Open these doors!

17:12.781 --> 17:14.532
- Look out!
- Oh, no.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.913
I refuse to fight you!
Fight it, Draal. Fight it!

17:20.998 --> 17:22.165
Open these doors!

17:22.249 --> 17:24.585
Hurry!
We cannot hold these doors for long.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.470
Huh.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.188
Open these doors!
Fine. I'll find another way.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.402
Not another step.
I don't want to have to do this.

17:54.698 --> 17:58.619
Please. I'm not going
to fight my friend.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.998
I can't fight my friend.

18:10.798 --> 18:14.051
Your friend is gone.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.763
You fight everyone else.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.475
- Even your Tribunal is against you.
- What?

18:21.558 --> 18:27.689
I am Gunmar. These aren't my only eyes.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.360
We'll save him.
And we'll stop you, Gunmar.

18:31.443 --> 18:36.115
You can't even kill this broken husk
that threatens your life.

18:36.198 --> 18:42.079
Kill this one-armed trash, or else
it will be used against you again.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.833
What do you want from me?
If you want to fight someone, fight me!

18:45.916 --> 18:51.797
I'd rather kill you with my own hands.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.011
Fight me!

18:58.095 --> 19:01.265
Fight me! Not Draal!

19:01.348 --> 19:03.517
No, not Draal.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.064
- Are you injured?
- No, I'm fine.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.150
But what do we do?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.485
Another Saturday detention
will do you no good.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.488
I suggest you collect yourself
and get back to class.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.407
Huh?

19:20.492 --> 19:21.785
What is that?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.876
Hmm. Who’s that? Who’s over there?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.351
Where's Lake?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.521
Right here, Señor Uhl.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.982
Just needed to sharpen my pencil.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.942
Ooh.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.403
I heard screaming and fighting.

19:56.486 --> 20:00.073
- Which of you left the room?
- We didn't hear anything.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.241
You told us to stay here.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.536
If no one is going to come forward,

20:04.620 --> 20:07.831
then all of you
will have detention next week!

20:09.416 --> 20:10.250
Ah.

20:11.251 --> 20:16.340
Mr. Pepperjack, you are a smart
young boy with a promising future.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.176
Possibly no detention next week.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.094
Who left the room?

20:24.806 --> 20:25.807
Nobody?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.436
You said we weren't supposed
to get out of our seats.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.522
So, you think you kids
can take me for a fool?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.983
Well, you know what? I have proof!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.778
Come with me. Now!

20:38.862 --> 20:40.530
Who did this?

20:40.614 --> 20:43.992
Looks to me like a prank
from our school rivals.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.161
"I hate Arcadia Oaks Academy."

20:46.245 --> 20:50.749
Probably Tight Jeans Hank. He was
pretty P.O.'d when I called it off.

20:53.001 --> 20:58.298
Very well then, you may leave.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.009
Who did that?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.804
I'll find out,
if it's the last thing I do!

21:10.269 --> 21:11.687
So, Draal is...?

21:11.770 --> 21:15.065
No, he’s not.
We can save him, right, Jimbo?

21:15.148 --> 21:17.943
You tell me. You saw him.
You were in the hall.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.737
That wasn't you
in the mole mascot costume?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.322
- What?
- Then who?

21:22.406 --> 21:25.659
Steve! He
disappeared from class.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.619
Steve saw Jim?

21:27.703 --> 21:31.832
Are you telling me that...
that Steve knows?

21:31.915 --> 21:34.793
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

21:44.344 --> 21:48.015
Under the authority of Trollmarket,
James Lake Jr.,

21:48.098 --> 21:51.935
you are under arrest
for the release of Gunmar,

21:52.019 --> 21:56.315
breaking your sacred oath,
and treason against trollkind.
