WEBVTT

00:46.588 --> 00:48.328
Come on, Jim.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.339
You've been taking pictures of
buildings all during our trip.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.503
Take a shot of me!

00:53.303 --> 00:56.716
You just stand by the door!
=I don't understand.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.887
It's a deserted chapel, and
somebody's holding the door!

01:00.894 --> 01:01.894
That's good!

01:03.564 --> 01:05.600
Oh, god!

01:16.410 --> 01:18.150
Run! Run!

01:18.161 --> 01:19.196
I ook!

01:19.204 --> 01:21.320
It's Frankenstein!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.330
Well, what do you think?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.202
About what? = the film?

01:29.214 --> 01:30.954
The, the, the thing
going through the door.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.206
Scary. - Ha?

01:32.217 --> 01:33.627
Where did you get that?
I got it.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.341
And no one else has seen it.
It's an exclusive.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.336
Oh, no. Gil, it's a phony.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.133
Those guys obviously
staged the whole thing

01:39.141 --> 01:40.347
so they'll get their
names in the paper.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.385
So what's up?

01:41.393 --> 01:42.724
You know, you better
think of something better

01:42.728 --> 01:44.264
because you're
going out on this story.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.688
What story?

01:45.856 --> 01:47.096
The monster story.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.930
No, no, ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.183
Mac, I don't want to go
out on a monster story.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.309
You don't want to go out?

01:52.863 --> 01:55.195
Every time I give
you a good lead,

01:55.198 --> 01:56.734
you tell me you
don't want to go out.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.622
Or if you do go out, you
come back with nothing!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.866
Not my fault.
And what about what you do to my stories?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.202
What do I do?
I can't believe we're

02:02.205 --> 02:05.365
talking about this again. I didn't want
to have this conversation one more time.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.835
The one you headlined "women
forced to work on rape factory,"

02:09.838 --> 02:11.078
when that was a rope factory.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.499
That was a typo. - A typo?

02:12.716 --> 02:15.879
Besides, "rape" is a grabber.
He's right. It is a big grabber.

02:15.886 --> 02:20.129
Look, didn't you hire me to raise
the journalistic level of this paper?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.175
Wrong!

02:21.183 --> 02:24.641
I hired you to raise the
vocabulary level of this paper.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.469
I want to keep the
journalistic level very low.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.401
Why do you think I teamed you up with him?
Hey!

02:29.608 --> 02:31.644
I'm a team player.
Mac, this is crap.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.651
Crap? I like crap.
I love crap. I need crap.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.478
Crap is what sells newspapers.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.277
Look around you... crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

02:39.284 --> 02:41.070
May I say I have no
problem with crap?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.910
Good boy. I'll be right back.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.287
Look, when you talk
to me, don't touch me.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.329
I don't touch you.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.917
No? What do you call, uh,
this and that and this?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.506
I don't want you to do this
or this, and especially this.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.129
I don't do that.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.468
Well, in case you think of
it, I don't want you to do it.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.381
You're going out right away.
What have we got?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.640
Planes, trains, buses.
Where are we going?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.388
Transylvania.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.853
What am I doing here?
Why am I working here?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.064
I should be going to Moscow.
I should be going to the middle east.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.229
Transylvania. All right!

03:16.697 --> 03:17.732
Where is that?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.123
Uh, I don't know.
It's over there, some place.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.156
We're going over
there some place.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.821
Fine. - We'll find it.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.615
You better find it
because I'm counting

03:25.622 --> 03:27.533
on you guys for a
Frankenstein story.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.160
I'm sorry? You're counting
on us for a what story?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.329
Frankenstein!
You remember Frankenstein?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.337
Big guy.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.545
Frankenstein.
I don't think he was still alive.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.914
You didn't think?
You didn't think. That's right.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.086
You didn't think.
He was never alive, shmohawk.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.755
That's the point.
That was a book!

03:40.762 --> 03:42.423
That was a movie!
That wasn't real life.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.046
And it certainly isn't the news!

03:44.057 --> 03:45.422
Well, I think it is.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.515
These guys are
watching that monster.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.601
And they think he looks
like Frankenstein!

03:49.604 --> 03:50.844
You're giving me a headache.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.847
Listen, why don't you take your
headache and get the hell out of here?

03:52.858 --> 03:55.474
Only when you come back, you
better come back with a story.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.648
A town in fear, uh, a mad scientist.
Something.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.943
Because if you guys come back with
nothing, you're both fired!

04:03.243 --> 04:04.904
You can't fire me. I'm your son.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.072
Prove it!

04:08.123 --> 04:09.363
Okay, okay.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.951
Here's the cassette.
Nah, now, we're not, uh,

04:10.959 --> 04:12.915
pushing it just a little
with this Frankenstein thing.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.705
I love to push it.
Why can't you be like him?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.293
I tell him that...
Are you going to come back with a story?

04:16.298 --> 04:17.333
Yes, dad. - You see that?

04:17.339 --> 04:19.250
Why don't you listen to him?
Listen to him.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.253
He makes me sick.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.419
Dark, demented scientist.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.592
Information, okay.
The stones of easter island.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.080
- I don't want to hear that.
- The landing strips in the andes.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.180
Now, hear this, both of you.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.728
Next week, I want
a banner headline:

04:33.899 --> 04:36.060
"Frankenstein lives!"

04:50.123 --> 04:52.990
J this can't be happening. J

04:53.627 --> 04:56.619
j so much I can't explain.

04:57.172 --> 05:01.962
J there's a logical j
j explanation for everything. J

05:04.221 --> 05:07.588
j done talking about the ways. J

05:07.849 --> 05:10.261

05:10.268 --> 05:16.184
j but if you need to, need to j
j reach me, you can call me. J

05:16.191 --> 05:21.481

j transylvania 6, ooh. J

05:39.464 --> 05:42.752
Ja shadow's in the waves. J

j a shape I can't forget. J»

05:46.471 --> 05:51.431
j things enter my room at j
j night and disappears. J

05:53.562 --> 06:01.560
j a piercing bloody scream is j
j bad cliche of a bad dream. J

06:01.570 --> 06:07.361
j but if you need to, need to j
j reach me, you can call me. J

06:07.367 --> 06:12.578

06:58.376 --> 07:01.914
J transylvania 6-5000. J

07:01.922 --> 07:03.162
j transylvania-6... j

07:03.173 --> 07:05.129
I don't understand it.
Rome, Paris Vienna.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.714
We had all that lousy weather.
Ll. Ook at this.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.379
Yeah, certainly, doesn't look
like... what did your dad say?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.501
"Town in fear,” does it?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.262
Transylvania's cute.
= it's cute.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.432
Laura, don't go too far.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.568
Hey, hey, hey.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.899
Go play with that kid.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.068
I don't want to play with the kid.
She's not my age.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.156
Play with the kid.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.947
Why should I play with
the... oh, I know why.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.157
Oh, excuse me.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.089
Hi

07:46.216 --> 07:48.047
You know, I saw
you sitting in the bus.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.051
I was going to come back.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.210
But I know...
But you were too bashful.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.221
That's right.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.345
And now, that we've met, I'm
gaining some self-confidence.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.384
Oh, good!

07:55.392 --> 07:58.259
Then it'll be easier for
you to deal with rejection.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.476
I aura!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.095
I told you to stay near me.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.267
Gil, stop playing with Laura.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.898
Uh, she's a lovely child. Is she yours?
Come on.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.862
Ah, Americans?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.608
Welcome to transylvania.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.200
I am mayor lepescu.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.444
Enjoy our shops.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.570
Enjoy our food.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.412
Enjoy our way of life.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.451
And be sure you
attend our annual wine

08:23.461 --> 08:25.417
festival known the
continent over.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.834
Great, we can get drunk together.
When is this wine festival?

08:27.841 --> 08:28.876
It begins tomorrow.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.592
And lasts as you Americans
say: "Till the cows go home"!

08:35.265 --> 08:36.380
I never say that, do you.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.471
Never.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.056
I say itonce in a
while, but I certainly

08:39.059 --> 08:42.052
don't say it in anything
other than a whimsical way.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.023
If you want to know my name, I'm...

08:55.035 --> 08:56.635
- Elizabeth Ellison.
- Elizabeth Ellison.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.037
I know.

08:59.205 --> 09:03.949
Uh, listen, Elizabeth, um, I'm
not staying at this, uh, hotel.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.370
I'm staying in another hotel.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.369
Can I call you by any chance?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.120
Would you, uh, like
to do something?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.997
Or would you like to go out
for dinner or something?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.874
I'm Jack Harrison, by the way.
I'm sorry.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.252
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you also.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.088
Look, I'll only be in
town a couple of days.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.382
So am I. I'm just
here a couple of days.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.849
Mommy, where's our room?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.434
We're going there now, honey.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.764
Hang on. I'm going to be right back.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.605
Hi, I'd like to ask you a question.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.898
This is just between you and me.
Yes, sir.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.780
Is there anything
happening around here?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.909
I see... you want a woman?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.653
No, no, no, no.
Has there been any trouble?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.746
Any strange goings on?

09:43.750 --> 09:44.750
Strange?

09:45.001 --> 09:49.040
You're looking for
something kinky?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.375
No, no, no, no.
Let me, let me put it this way.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.965
I've heard stories.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.042
Stories? About us?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.256
I mean Frankenstein.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.934
Who?

10:02.519 --> 10:05.056
Frankenstein.
You know Frankenstein, don't you?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.016
Frankenstein? Yes! The monster.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.724
That Frankenstein.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.443
N uta! 0, ho, ho

10:16.574 --> 10:17.984
yes, uncle?

10:17.992 --> 10:20.358
Have you seen
Frankenstein lately?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.615
Frankenstein?

10:25.542 --> 10:26.873
I don't think so.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.538
Oh, mayor.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.295
No, don't bother the mayor.
Please don't.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.630
This man is asking
about a Frankenstein.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.632
Frankenstein?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.161
Frank Sinatra.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.664
I was asking about
frank Sinatra, really.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.586
You understand the joke.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.677
It was just a silly...
I was kidding.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.546
Where... where have you been?
What's all this about?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.318
Nothing. I asked the
clerk a simple question.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.428
What kind of question?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.187
I asked about Frankenstein.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.731
What? - Frankenstein, okay?

11:33.735 --> 11:35.350
I asked about Frankenstein.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.897
I am sorry.

11:36.905 --> 11:40.022
We're in town five minutes, and you
ask a pointblank question like that?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.569
Should I have eased into it?
What do you think?

11:41.576 --> 11:42.782
I'm sorry. I don't know.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.034
Frankenstein.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, my friend was just kidding.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.114
That's an American, uh, joke.
It's a big joke.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.125
I know...

11:50.877 --> 11:52.117
Oh no, wait.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.206
This is transylvania.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.924
You don't want to
ask us about Dracula?

12:00.803 --> 12:01.918
Okay...

12:01.930 --> 12:04.888
Or how about the "creature
from the black lagoon"?

12:05.850 --> 12:08.341
Hey, I've got Godzilla
in the back room.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.684
I like it. It's a good one.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.177
How about the blob?

12:12.190 --> 12:15.307
Hey! I haven't seen him.
But ask me about the blob!

12:15.818 --> 12:18.309
You incredible asshole!
We are here five minutes,

12:18.321 --> 12:19.811
make me the laughingstock
of transylvania.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.687
They laughed at me, too.
Deservedly so!

12:23.409 --> 12:24.819
Go, bring them to me.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.907
Thank you.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.160
Look, there's the castle.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.449
Doesn't it have an
ominous aura about it?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.652
"An ominous aura"?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.497
Yeah.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.951
Where's my wallet?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.376
Wallet?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.126
May I help you?

13:18.589 --> 13:21.752
Hi, um. This is Mr. Harrison.
I'm Mr. Turner.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.712
Ah, yes.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.335
You are expected.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.442
Get away from there.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.864
Come on, get, get, stop!

13:50.872 --> 13:53.113
Get away, stop, yeah.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.708
Excuse me.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.043
Get out of here.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.874
Get away from there
you, you fool!

14:00.048 --> 14:03.040
You, you, you stupid idiot!

14:05.928 --> 14:08.715
No, you, you, you idiot!

14:10.099 --> 14:11.839
Oh, it's good.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.178
Ouch!

14:18.733 --> 14:22.066
You, you go there.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.780
Don't judge this hotel by me.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.066
I'm just the token brute.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.117
Token brute? - Yeah, here.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.746
Is good, huh?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.123
Is funny!

14:38.336 --> 14:40.873
Oh, there, uh, eh, heh?

14:41.339 --> 14:42.339
Is funny!

14:42.632 --> 14:44.042
Yeah, come.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.259
The owner would like
to have you for lunch,

14:48.429 --> 14:50.636
figuratively speaking.
Haha, of course.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.095
If you need anything,
my name is fejos.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.013
Fejos. - Fejos.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.937
Agele... I'm sorry.
Is that your last name?

14:59.941 --> 15:00.976
No, no.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.067
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.479
We don't speak...

15:08.658 --> 15:10.865
Transylvania.
Do we have a phrase book?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.870
Is good? - Is good.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.613
It's very good. - Is good, eh.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.036
Is good, huh?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.205
Is good? - Uh, I guess.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.170
My friends, we are expecting you.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.043
The mayor?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.751
Yes. I am also the
owner of the castle.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.922
Ah, many hats, huh?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.548
As you Americans say:
"Nothing wrong with making a buck."

15:36.686 --> 15:37.766
That's all.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.094
Later, we shall eat.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.062
But first, let me show
you to your rooms.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.148
Great.
Uh, I, I can show them, huh?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.193
Fine, fejos.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.903
Let me show you to your rooms.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.494
Good, ha? - Ha?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.916
Easy. - Very good.

16:01.919 --> 16:02.919
Eh, is good, ha?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.416
He's got a million of them.
Yeah!

16:08.259 --> 16:10.466
You're going to love it here.
= careful.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.721
And for you,
a little orange juice,

16:15.725 --> 16:19.138
maybe a little blue juice,
a little pineapple juice.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.726
The coffee's not ready yet.
Thank you.

16:21.689 --> 16:25.932
This is a theme hotel.
It's a little like Disneyland.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.901
Only, of course, it is
themed transylvanian lore.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.399
When your editor wired
that you are coming,

16:31.407 --> 16:33.648
I welcomed the
opportunity to show

16:33.659 --> 16:36.742
that there are no
scary monsters here!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.654
The only monster
is the phone bill.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.244
Do you expect a lot
of business here?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.170
Ooh, as you Americans say:

16:48.174 --> 16:50.005
"We'll have to beat
them off with a rake"!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.009
Radu.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.796
Yes, master.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.180
This is Mr. Turner.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.807
Hello, master.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.141
And this is Mr. Harrison.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.180
Hello, master.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.271
Well, he's a cute
little fellow, isn't he?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.349
He's part of the whole story.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.275
That is why I have hired
people like him and fejos.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.079
Well, they have that
certain transylvanian flair.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.781
Uh, we're ready for lunch, rad...

17:24.794 --> 17:25.829
Yes, master.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.004
I'm busy now. I'm busy.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.382
Ok, uh, get ready.
I need the grapefruit.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.800
What do you want?
The grapefruit.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.218
I'll get it. - I'll get it.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.178
I'll get it. - I'll get it.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.221
All right.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.307
I'll get it. We just need three.

17:45.314 --> 17:51.184
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.111
Okay, then we get the bowls.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.279
I'll cut the grapefruit.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.165
You don't cut anything.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.830
All right. I want help you.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.290
Okay.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.385
What is this?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.141
Ah, that's lemon
juice for the tea.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.310
Stay away from me.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.306
Okay, let's see we got the
sandwiches over there.

18:30.318 --> 18:33.105
We got the butter over there.
Everything is here and there.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.645
I know that. - Yes, master.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.988
I am not your master.
You are my wife.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.358
But I'm your wife, master.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.327
Go away, lupi.
I cannot stand subordinates.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.492
Neither can il. I'll stay away.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.539
Did you miss me?

18:54.342 --> 18:55.342
Let go.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.459
Let me help. - I said let go.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
Ok, take it.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.093
I've got it.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.260
Now, what are you going to do with it?
Hand it to you.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.725
What is this for?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.386
It's for you.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.101
You are such a lowlife...

19:14.111 --> 19:15.396
Okay...

19:16.572 --> 19:17.778
Is this right?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.272
Don't be a noitch.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.569
I just want to make
everything perfect

19:21.577 --> 19:23.693
for you because you deserve it.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.287
Once and for all,
stay away from me.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.281
Don't touch me. Leave me alone.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.292
Okay.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.295
Maybe later.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.173
I'll be lewd when you come back.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.639
I ewd?

19:51.065 --> 19:52.851
Lunch, young masters.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.604
I prepared it all myself.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.820
How nice.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.322
You... you want cream?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.909
Is good. You cream, eh.
No, no, no, thank you.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.282
Smell, is good.
I can smell it fine.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.245
Is fresh. - It's very fresh.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.411
Take it out of there.
Oh, but it's, it's good.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.625
Thank you. - No cream?

20:12.837 --> 20:13.872
Eh, sugar?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.582
Now, this good. This nice.
Very nice.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.875
You smell there.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.877
Smell it. Is good.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.087
Here... this good.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.133
Smell this.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.090
Smell everything here.

20:27.935 --> 20:28.935
Here.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.886
Smell this. Smell the glass.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.475
That's good.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.481
Fejos.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.146
They're very nice. - Eat, eat.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.396
You got it in your eye.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.408
Just a little bit.

20:43.951 --> 20:44.986
Heh, do it again.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.535
Here, phone.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.626
Transylvania 6-5000.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.796
Mayor, it's for you.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.513
Hello. Ow! The phone bit me.

21:07.850 --> 21:12.935
Hey, did you hear the one
about the surgeon with lobotomy?

21:13.314 --> 21:15.145
No, the surgeon with lobotomy?
Yeah.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.607
You don't "lo-bother-me,”
I don't "lo-bother-you."”

21:22.156 --> 21:23.362
yeah, it's funny, ha?

21:36.003 --> 21:37.789
What do you want?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.628
I have to do my work.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.339
Your work is my work.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.301
I have no time.
Your time is my time.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.044
I have to get the mints.
= I'll get them.

21:47.056 --> 21:47.841
No. - Yes.

21:48.015 --> 21:48.800
No. - Yes.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.638
No. - Yes.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.427
No. - Yes.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.140
No. - Okay.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.020
Kiss goodbye?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.185
I'll keep it warm for you.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.358
Mints, master? =no.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.446
Mints, master? = no thanks.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.324
Mints, master? =no.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.163
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
I must go into the town.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.704
But, uh, feel free to
inspect the castle.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.079
Sure you will find no
ghouls lurking about.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.502
May I suggest something?

22:24.510 --> 22:26.216
You do suggest
something, you baboon.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.209
Give me a break.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.677
I'm going to start
working the story, okay?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.842
I say we go to town, check
out the local papers,

22:30.850 --> 22:31.850
hit the chapel.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.521
Ah, one o'clock.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.560
I'm late.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.101
Frankenstein!

23:13.434 --> 23:14.434
Hello!

23:23.152 --> 23:24.517
Anybody here?

24:09.907 --> 24:13.866
These old chandeliers have
a tendency to give way.

24:14.745 --> 24:15.745
Who are you?

24:17.247 --> 24:18.862
I'm inspector percek.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.582
A better question is
what are you doing here?

24:22.044 --> 24:23.875
I heard they were
having a novena.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.081
Novena?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.538
Isn't this our lady
of perpetual sorrow?

24:27.549 --> 24:28.584
No.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.754
I must be in the wrong church.
Excuse me.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.947
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.320
I've been working pretty hard.
But listen...

24:59.331 --> 25:01.451
I don't have time right now.
I've got some time off.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.784
And, uh, I was wondering,
could we have dinner tonight?

25:04.795 --> 25:05.875
I've got... hey, hey...
= oh, oh!

25:05.879 --> 25:06.994
Who are you talking to?
What are you doing?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.006
You don't knock?

25:08.382 --> 25:09.667
I got to knock?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.290
It's impolite to into a
person's room without knocking.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.196
Okay, okay, whatever you want.
You want to know what I'm doing?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.926
I'm sorry. I was interrupted...

25:15.097 --> 25:16.132
By a wind.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.471
So what about tonight?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.010
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.053
I knocked.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.470
You didn't wait for
"who is it?" And...

25:21.478 --> 25:23.309
Oh, now, I got to wait for "who is it?"
How long is this...

25:23.313 --> 25:24.313
Out, out, out.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.773
Well, no, you can get a
babysitter at the hotel.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.563
No, no, no. I'm sure they have one.

25:30.571 --> 25:34.155
Or, you know, Laura seems so
capable, she's very grown up.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.773
You've got to say "who is it.”

25:36.118 --> 25:37.949
Excuse me, hold on one second.
Gee.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.988
All right, who is it?

25:38.996 --> 25:40.406
Wait till I'm outside. - Right!

25:40.706 --> 25:41.991
I'm sorry.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.446
Elizabeth, are you there? Hello?

25:44.126 --> 25:45.126
Hello?

25:46.587 --> 25:48.669
Why didn't you say "who is it"?
I might, if you...

25:48.672 --> 25:49.661
I mean, I knocked!
1 know it's you.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.233
It's boring already.
What's your news?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.291
My news, in case you're interested...
= I'm not really.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.669
The editor of the local
paper was very close-mouthed.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.840
Did you check any
of the back issues?

25:57.848 --> 26:00.260
Yes, I don't understand this.
I'm very suspicious.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.258
There wasn't even a hint
of any tourist scares.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.509
Of course, it's a real paper.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.182
Their editor doesn't fall for
stupidity like, uh, other people.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.148
I did find one small
item about a Dr. malavaqua

26:09.151 --> 26:11.767
who lost his license to practice
medicine, thank you very much.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.145
So what? My doctor lost his
license to practice medicine.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.772
Yeah, but maybe that malavaqua
was delving into the unknown.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.945
Maybe he was traversing
uncharted territory.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.613
Maybe... - Maybe? No, no, no.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.452
You've got nothing there.
Don't you get that?

26:22.456 --> 26:23.696
There's no story there.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.617
What is this "maybe"?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.365
Just the same, I want to
go to the old age home.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.707
I want to investigate. = fine!

26:27.711 --> 26:28.871
You want to investigate,
that's great.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.039
Just don't make up anything.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.082
Don't make up stories.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.172
I never made up a
story in my life.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.049
Uh, please don't hit me.
And what about your first job?

26:36.053 --> 26:37.884
Your father told you to find
people who look like their pets.

26:37.888 --> 26:38.968
I did. - No, you didn't.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.758
You found people who look like
animals and gave them pets.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.222
That's called initiative.
What about you?

26:42.226 --> 26:43.511
You don't know what
reporting means.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.682
Did you check out the castle?
Uh, yeah, Gil. There's nothing.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.894
Just rooms.

26:47.898 --> 26:48.933
Just what I saw.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.147
Nothing. Oh, oh, okay...

26:50.150 --> 26:51.640
I go to check out the chapel.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.860
If this isn't suspicious,
the chief of police tried to kill me.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.354
I just came from there.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Gil.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.197
That's what the police in
this town are looking to do.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.816
Uh, uh, where are you
getting that from?

27:00.828 --> 27:02.489
You know, you really are
just like your father.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.906
Your job is about writing
down what you see.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.199
Don't you start about my father.
Usually, they exist.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.323
He's the one paying our checks!
He paid for us to come here.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.870
Stop it. I'm not going
to listen to this again.

27:08.877 --> 27:09.992
You're so childish.
Hum, hum, hum...

27:10.003 --> 27:11.413
You really are a baby. - Hoohoo.

27:11.588 --> 27:12.873
Hum, hum. You're sick.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.048
Come in.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.338
Hey, I got a message for you.
=-from whom?

27:18.512 --> 27:20.673
Some old, uh, gypsy
man delivered it.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.216
Here, here.

27:25.686 --> 27:26.766
No, no, no. Not now!
Is good, ha?

27:26.770 --> 27:27.805
No, it's not good now.
Is good...

27:27.813 --> 27:28.893
It's bad time. - Why?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.103
Goodbye. We're busy. - No, wait.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.438
I, I want to show you something!
Now, get out.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.556
Wait! = qut!

27:32.568 --> 27:34.980
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.487
Ha?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.236
Is good, ha? =no.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.525
Eh, weh? - Goodbye.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.693
What? - Goodbye.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.494
Out!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.073
God that man is pathetic.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.081
What does this say?

27:47.541 --> 27:48.906
"Laughter conceals fear.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.908
And the wheel of
truth has many spokes.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.331
The answer you seek lies
with madame morovia."

27:54.006 --> 27:56.338
Gypsies.
Now, we're getting somewhere.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.547
A touch of the old world.

28:02.639 --> 28:06.097
Ll ife has run its course.

28:06.852 --> 28:10.015
But as the rain enters the sea...

28:10.230 --> 28:14.519
So tears surround
with a predestined hand.

28:15.360 --> 28:22.448
Existence is to be absconded
with eternal consciousness.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.739
We cannot tell where
the path leads.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.403
But the impossible, sometimes,

28:28.415 --> 28:31.657
permits itself the
luxury of occurring.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.791
How can we truly preserve the
universe beyond the sphere?

28:37.758 --> 28:43.173
The allegory of a physical mouth is
for the spiritual one to understand.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.889
Excuse me, madame morovia. We were...
=l see a creature.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.387
Not the one you seek.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.095
The creature walks
as a man by day,

28:53.357 --> 28:58.772
but as the full moon
rises, he becomes a wolf.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.816
He is a werewolf.

29:01.823 --> 29:02.823
Werewolf?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.782
You must find him.

29:06.245 --> 29:11.285
Destroy him and put
him out of his torment.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.651
Why are you telling us this?
Why don't you go to the police?

29:13.919 --> 29:17.377
They laugh at me as
they laugh at you.

29:17.381 --> 29:18.791
Where do we find this werewolf?

29:19.508 --> 29:23.626
He goes by the name
of Lawrence malbot.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.131
He is my son.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.350
Your son?

29:29.601 --> 29:33.185
I pray that his
suffering will end

29:33.397 --> 29:38.061
and his soul rests
in eternal peace.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.270
I sleep now.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.661
Uh, I don't think she
has any more to tell us.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.270
Ll ife has run its course.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.527
This is my contribution to
journalism waiting for a werewolf.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.616
Let's go inside and
ask him some questions.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.820
Sure. What are we going to ask him?
Uh, how often do you shave?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.552
Are you a loner?
Or do you go out in a pack?

30:37.044 --> 30:38.044
Maybe we should wait.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.559
Did you see that?

31:03.570 --> 31:04.855
He looked up at full moon.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.072
So what?

31:08.742 --> 31:09.777
Come on.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.182
You hear that? A wolf.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.033
Wait.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.197
I think he stopped moving.

32:18.562 --> 32:19.562
Who are you?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.095
Who sent you? My wife?

32:21.523 --> 32:24.139
Oh, my god. I'm terribly sorry.
We thought you were an animal.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.317
He is.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.440
Come on. - Not now, Larry.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.736
The magic is gone.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.994
Uh, you had to shine that
flashlight right on his ass.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.579
You embarrassed
the hell out of me.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.074
Who knew we'd run right
smack in the middle of it?

32:42.085 --> 32:44.167
Do you make that much noise
when you're having sex?

32:44.171 --> 32:45.786
I don't remember because
I've been here too long.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.628
Where are you going?
Uh, I got a lead.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.799
Sure, you do.

32:48.925 --> 32:49.914
You just get some sleep.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.291
Tomorrow, go and
see that doctor.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.385
When you don't find anything,
I'm wiring Mac that, uh,

32:53.388 --> 32:55.344
Frankenstein doesn't
live here anymore.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.474
And get the hell out of my room.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.187
A lot of hostility, Jack.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.323
Can I offer you more wine?
Oh, no. No, thank you.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.489
So what was I saying?

33:18.955 --> 33:22.664
Oh, uh, you were running from
your ex-husband and, uh, whatnot.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.828
I wasn't really, you
know, running away.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.703
It's just that he
keeps bothering me.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.794
Oh.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.540
He wasn't too happy when
I got custody of Laura.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.877
And then he got violent.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.630
Do you know that I had
to pick up a wine bottle

33:37.641 --> 33:39.552
and smash him over
the head with it

33:39.559 --> 33:40.924
just so I could
get away from him?

33:40.936 --> 33:42.016
Bad news.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.811
He gets me so mad!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.268
He's like a nut when
things don't go his way.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.017
Sounds like...
Oh, what a lovely couple.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.312
Are you local people or
just pissing through?

33:53.823 --> 33:55.609
Ah, we are just “pissing”
through, I think.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.450
Uh, well, um, actually,
I'm from New York.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.408
New jork!

33:59.412 --> 34:00.822
We know that one, of course.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.240
“New jork." Hit it boys.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.659
Start spreading the news.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.168
I'm leaving today.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.333
Hey, come on, boys.
Pick up the tempo!

34:11.341 --> 34:13.172
They have a great, uh, they
have a great video of this.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.335
Have you seen the video?

34:14.344 --> 34:15.958
I want to be a part of it.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.132
New jork, new jork.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.844
Oh, for crying out loud!

34:20.100 --> 34:23.092
Such a happy people with
their "new jorks, new jorks."

34:23.103 --> 34:24.967
But hey! Enough about me.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.687
I can't imagine what you
could be investigating here.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.022
Oh, neither can I. No, no.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.639
Don't, I... I don't
want to talk about it.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.692
No, no, no. Just tell me,
tell me, tell me, tell me.

34:35.072 --> 34:39.315
Actually, I'm investigating,
um, uh, Frankenstein.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.655
I know, I know. It's my sort of point.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.577
You asked. I'm sensitive about it.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.951
You mean, the monster? The rrrh!

34:49.795 --> 34:51.878
With the bolts and the elevated...

34:54.967 --> 34:57.550
I'm gone. - Um, are you kidding?

35:49.689 --> 35:50.689
Who's there?

35:51.316 --> 35:53.523
Who is it? Who's here? Who is it?

35:53.902 --> 35:55.813
Jack! Jack!

35:56.196 --> 35:57.527
Jack! - What? What?

35:57.530 --> 35:58.810
What's the matter?
What happened?

35:59.449 --> 36:00.985
I think there's
something in this room.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.862
Where? What?

36:03.078 --> 36:04.739
There's nothing in here.
=I don't know.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.282
I don't know. May...
Maybe it went out the window.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.289
Maybe?

36:09.668 --> 36:10.874
It's morning already.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.915
There's nothing out there.
=I don't know.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.412
What did you see?
= I'm not sure.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.630
Uh, I think it was some sort
of a creature or something.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.372
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.002
You smell perfume?

36:22.347 --> 36:23.347
Yes.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.797
I know what's in this room.
What?

36:24.808 --> 36:27.174
The creature from estee lauder.
You're joking, but I'm nervous.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.425
It's jet lag.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.846
Go back to sleep.

36:31.815 --> 36:34.227
The facts, Gil! The facts!

36:35.026 --> 36:36.026
The facts.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.245
The facts.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.737
Let him spend a
night in this room.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.868
He thinks... is that a bomb?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.866
What's that? What is that?

36:57.465 --> 36:58.500
Here.

36:58.508 --> 36:59.873
What's that? What?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.755
No, it's no... nothing.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.885
What have I done?

37:10.270 --> 37:11.885
Do over here.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.849
Now, do over here.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.639
Now, do over there.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.483
Lupi, leave me alone.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.486
Right.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.403
Do over here.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.405
Now, do over here.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.874
Lupi. - What?

37:34.878 --> 37:37.335
I said leave me alone.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.874
I'm helping you.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.589
Ah, you big lug.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.629
Ah, radu. Yes, master?

37:43.928 --> 37:46.419
Have you seen the mayor?
Yes, master. He's at breakfast.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.921
Why do you call me master?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.172
That's what you are.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.845
No, no, no, no. My name is Gil.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.433
Call me Gil.
I could not do that.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.390
Oh, sure you can.
Go ahead. Now, try it.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.351
Geh

37:58.943 --> 38:00.604
hello, Gil.

38:00.862 --> 38:01.897
Yes, Gil.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.027
Tha... that's fine.
Call me, call me master.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.365
Thank you, master.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.029
Ah, Mr. Turner.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.412
Good morning. - Good morning.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.422
Eqg?

38:20.548 --> 38:21.879
Cute. No, thank you.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.916
I sort of pack them in,
as you Americans say.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.338
They're standing in the aisles.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.632
Mayor, are we the only
guests in the hotel?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.551
Sure. Eh, this contractors.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.300
We don't open officially
yet for another month.

38:33.895 --> 38:34.895
Why?

38:35.730 --> 38:36.719
I don't know.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.767
L... 1 thought I saw
someone in my room.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.981
I guess I was just dreaming.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.440
This castle can do it to you.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.901
First night I slept here...

38:44.656 --> 38:46.192
I thought I saw Dracula.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.331
That's funny.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.166
Are you and youru
partner having breakfast?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.250
No, he's still asleep.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.746
If you see him, tell him I'm going
into town to check on some things.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.122
Oh, yes, sure.

39:07.136 --> 39:08.171
Hey! - What?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.339
I want to show you something.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.133
Jeez, you scared
the hell out of me!

39:11.474 --> 39:12.964
Wait, wait, here. Here.
I got to get...

39:12.976 --> 39:14.682
No, no, wait! I don't have time.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.348
I want to show you.
Here, here, wait.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.308
See?

39:19.315 --> 39:20.315
Here.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.772
Oh, it's a beautiful day today.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.649
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

39:28.074 --> 39:30.406
What the hell? - No, I fine.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.286
You.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.110
I want you to try. Here.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.706
Here.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.614
No, no, no, no. I've got to go.
=you do it!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.491
Is good. Go, you be...
=you're insane!

39:40.336 --> 39:41.336
Hey!

39:42.505 --> 39:43.665
You can do it!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.382
Hey!

39:46.467 --> 39:47.798
Okay, we run!

40:29.552 --> 40:30.587
Radu.

40:30.970 --> 40:31.970
Yes, master.

40:32.597 --> 40:36.260
I want you to be sure no
one goes in the guest rooms.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.267
Yes, master.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.128
Hi. Yes?

41:15.139 --> 41:17.004
I'd like to see Dr. malavaqua.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.928
Only relatives of the
guest are allowed to visit.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.843
I can't even see the doctor?

41:22.355 --> 41:23.970
He only sees people
by appointment.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.268
Oh, okay, fine.
I'll make an appointment.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.146
He is not making
appointments at this time.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.566
I see.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.107
Ok, thank you for your help.

42:10.903 --> 42:11.903
Hi, ladies.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.404
Beautiful, isn't it?

42:19.579 --> 42:20.579
Have a nice day.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.298
Run! Run!

42:38.473 --> 42:39.588
I ook!

42:39.599 --> 42:41.806
It's Frankenstein!

42:42.018 --> 42:43.303
I don't like this.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.224
I don't like this at all.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.725
This film must be destroyed.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.898
Old age home... nothing!
All those disabled people.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.446
There's something going.
I don't know what.

43:00.453 --> 43:01.909
I don't know. Why all that security?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.370
I said okay, but when we see the
police, you do the talking.

43:04.373 --> 43:05.373
Hi

43:10.046 --> 43:13.504
I can well understand
your Frankenstein fixation.

43:13.508 --> 43:16.466
After all, you are
in transylvania.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.628
But in your own country...

43:20.098 --> 43:24.842
They still seek to write lurid
stories about your Jesse James

43:24.852 --> 43:26.012
or your dillinger.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.351
That was a long time ago.

43:27.355 --> 43:28.595
That is my point.

43:29.315 --> 43:33.979
The sinister image of transylvania
is our "long time ago."

43:34.278 --> 43:37.065
If you want to write about us,

43:37.073 --> 43:39.655
write about a happy transylvania.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.403
Our new sewer system.

43:41.410 --> 43:45.323
Our skyscraper...
Six floors, you know.

43:45.498 --> 43:48.490
Our newspaper didn't send us all
this way to write about a sewer.

43:49.085 --> 43:52.577
We can't have you
bothering Dr. malavaqua

43:52.588 --> 43:53.873
with your ludicrous questions.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.546
He's a busy man.

43:55.842 --> 43:58.549
Oh, really?
Is that why his license was revoked?

43:59.137 --> 44:00.137
Now, come on.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.294
This line of
inquiry is fruitless

44:02.306 --> 44:03.887
and beyond your concern.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.097
We must bid you a good day.

44:05.101 --> 44:06.716
What about all the people...
We're going now.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.513
What about them?
Thank you very much.

44:08.521 --> 44:09.852
Fine, fine.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.221
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

44:11.691 --> 44:14.808
And you are too serious.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.810
You must learn to frolic.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.229
Take up dance. Who knows?

44:19.240 --> 44:21.151
You could be another
Dean Astaire.

44:25.079 --> 44:28.071
Did you happen to catch the look on
their faces when I mentioned malavaqua?

44:28.082 --> 44:29.697
Okay, so they don't
want to talk about it.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.916
They're hiding something.
I don't believe that percek.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.001
All right. I got a few free hours.
Let's go.

44:34.005 --> 44:34.994
Where?

44:35.006 --> 44:37.167
To see that doctor and,
uh, get a second opinion.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.175
All right.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.802
Get down.

44:52.982 --> 44:53.982
Get up.

44:55.610 --> 44:56.610
Get down.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.242
Come on.

45:06.662 --> 45:07.662
Get up.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.803
The guard isn't there.
Why did you get down?

45:14.003 --> 45:15.914
I got into a rhythm.
What? Get up.

45:37.026 --> 45:38.311
Now, that's a coincidence.

45:38.653 --> 45:40.314
We just talked to percek and
the mayor about the doctor.

45:40.321 --> 45:41.481
Next thing we
know, they're here.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.104
I'd like to know what's
going on in there.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.605
Come on, maybe we can
get in through the back.

45:44.617 --> 45:45.617
Okay.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.173
What's this?
This is a chance to break in.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.417
You climb over this gate.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.463
One arm.

46:05.471 --> 46:07.007
If it's our chance,
why am I breaking in?

46:07.014 --> 46:09.734
You look more like a mental case.
Very funny. You know, I'm scared.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.307
What if this is electrified?
Here.

46:12.311 --> 46:14.431
There, see? It's not electrified.
Now, climb the gate.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.345
What if the guard sees me?
Just go.

46:16.565 --> 46:17.565
Okay, okay...

46:24.490 --> 46:27.072
Uh, patient trying to get out!
Patient trying to get out!

46:27.785 --> 46:28.905
What the hell are you doing?

46:29.453 --> 46:30.693
Hey, you!

46:33.708 --> 46:34.708
Please!

46:36.419 --> 46:37.784
Where do you think
you are going?

46:38.296 --> 46:39.296
Get back in there.

46:40.798 --> 46:41.833
You are new here?

46:42.591 --> 46:44.252
Didn't you get your
observation today?

46:45.219 --> 46:47.005
Later. Get back to work.

46:52.893 --> 46:56.602
Why this renewed concern
about my experimenting again?

46:57.023 --> 47:02.643
Two reporters have been inquiring
about, uh, Frankenstein monster.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.940
Frankenstein?

47:06.574 --> 47:07.905
That's ridiculous.

47:07.908 --> 47:08.908
Yes.

47:09.201 --> 47:11.157
That's what I told them.

47:12.872 --> 47:16.160
Your friend hunyadi
is the only one

47:16.167 --> 47:19.375
who might fit that
bizarre description.

47:19.378 --> 47:23.212
And you assured me
that he is deceased.

47:25.092 --> 47:28.129
May I see his file?

47:29.472 --> 47:31.884
Certainly, inspector percek.

47:32.892 --> 47:35.224
I filled out the death
certificate myself.

47:41.859 --> 47:45.727
And these others...
Patrick Glenn...

47:46.322 --> 47:48.529
Odette Barlow, John vlad.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.449
All dead as well? - Yes, sir.

47:52.661 --> 47:55.619
Ooh, you seem to be
in a roll, malavaqua.

47:57.583 --> 48:00.290
I enjoy these little visits.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.503
They relieve me of the
burdens my job can bring.

48:27.154 --> 48:29.566
Transylvania 6-5000.

48:29.865 --> 48:32.197
Fejos, could I
please speak to rad...

48:32.410 --> 48:34.366
Radu!

48:34.829 --> 48:37.912
Where are you? Here.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.075
Yes, master.

48:42.795 --> 48:45.161
Radu, are you alone?
Yes, master.

48:45.714 --> 48:46.794
Please, rad...

48:46.799 --> 48:49.757
Go to the laboratory and make
sure that hunyadi is there.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.212
He may be on the loose again.

48:51.220 --> 48:52.756
Yes, master. - Thank you

48:55.307 --> 48:58.094
Jack! I found out something.
How the hell do I get out of here?

48:58.102 --> 48:59.558
Simple. Go to the front
and climb over the wall.

48:59.562 --> 49:00.927
Take off the robe.
Are you crazy?

49:00.938 --> 49:02.394
The guard out front knows me.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.767
Trust me. - Uh, yeah.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.515
How come I always have
to do the trusting?

49:06.527 --> 49:08.188
Are you a middle child? - Yeah.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.195
So?

49:09.947 --> 49:10.947
Go!

49:23.043 --> 49:24.999
Man trying to get in!
Man trying to get in!

49:25.004 --> 49:26.665
Hey! Hey! You!

49:27.756 --> 49:28.836
It's you again!

49:29.049 --> 49:30.835
I told you before,
you couldn't come in.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.333
Now, get out!

49:36.474 --> 49:37.509
Stay out!

49:40.436 --> 49:42.552
That was brilliant.
But don't do that to me anymore.

49:42.563 --> 49:44.303
I'm anxiety prone.
Okay, did you get anything?

49:44.315 --> 49:45.896
Or did I waste my expertise
on dilly-dallying.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.767
Listen to this. Malavaqua called
that little weasel at the castle.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.392
Which weasel? = rad...

49:50.404 --> 49:52.269
He works for the doctor.
They're anxious to find hunyadi.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.522
And get this, they're
supposed to go to the lab.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.364
Who's hunyadi? And what lab?
=I don't know.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.858
But with all this
subterfuge and double talk,

49:57.870 --> 49:59.280
you got to admit
we're on to something.

49:59.288 --> 50:01.199
Maybe.
Maybe? I got a "maybe" out of you?

50:01.207 --> 50:02.947
Come on, let's go back to
the castle and see rad...

50:02.958 --> 50:04.698
Okay, you go.
And I'll meet you there later.

50:04.919 --> 50:05.919
Why aren't you going?

50:06.170 --> 50:07.205
I'm going to a picnic.

50:09.548 --> 50:10.548
Picnic?

50:28.108 --> 50:29.439
It's a lady doll.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.688
Just as I thought.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.114
Malavaqua has played
me for a fool.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.537
Put this in my car.

50:47.545 --> 50:48.580
Fvidence.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.168
I love you so much and everything.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.840
I wanted to help you because...

51:30.588 --> 51:33.125
Hi!

51:34.049 --> 51:35.880
Where is radu? =no.

51:35.884 --> 51:37.374
No radu. - No rad...

51:37.386 --> 51:39.377
Hey, you come in here.

51:39.388 --> 51:40.924
What are you doing in there?
= no, it's nice.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.371
Come in here.
Don't! Don't pull me.

51:56.822 --> 51:57.822
Radu?

52:20.429 --> 52:21.669
Boo! - Oh!

52:21.680 --> 52:23.716
My god. - Do not be afraid.

52:23.724 --> 52:24.884
Afraid?

52:24.892 --> 52:27.133
My name is odette. - Great.

52:28.687 --> 52:29.687
Listen.

52:30.022 --> 52:31.853
They are the children of the night.

52:32.107 --> 52:33.688
They're doing it out in the daytime.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.058
They make beautiful
music, don't they?

52:36.070 --> 52:37.560
The sound like wolves to me.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.217
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Have you been in my room at night?

52:41.617 --> 52:42.823
Did you want to hurt me?

52:43.369 --> 52:44.825
I do not.

52:45.204 --> 52:46.694
Bite you, yes.

52:46.705 --> 52:48.320
Wait a minute. Wait a minute...
I love you.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.368
Great, great, okay.
I want to kiss you.

52:50.376 --> 52:51.991
Can't we have lunch
first or something?

52:52.002 --> 52:54.118
Put your hands on my hips.
Okay...

52:54.713 --> 52:56.704
Put your arms around me.

52:57.466 --> 52:59.172
Put your face to my breast.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.258
Tell me you want me, too.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.220
Speak to me, baby. - I'm trying!

53:05.516 --> 53:08.428
Oh, I want you so bad, it hurts.

53:08.435 --> 53:09.595
You do?

53:10.604 --> 53:11.604
Oh, yeah.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.763
Oh, I like that.

53:15.526 --> 53:16.891
I want do to it some more.

53:18.612 --> 53:19.818
Oh, that hurt!

53:23.242 --> 53:24.322
Who is it?

53:26.120 --> 53:28.236
I better see who it is. Okay...

53:32.292 --> 53:33.532
Don't come in.

53:38.549 --> 53:40.085
Oh, come on now.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.874
Wait a minute.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.139
Aha.

53:49.768 --> 53:51.804
Hey! Is fast!

53:52.312 --> 53:53.677
What are you doing here?

53:53.689 --> 53:56.021
I'm meditating.
Did you see Dracula?

53:56.024 --> 53:57.935
Yah, yah. When it first came out.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.558
Not the movie! The person.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.106
Never mind. Never mind.
No, no, wait!

54:01.113 --> 54:02.694
Hey, I want to
show you something.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.657
Oh, my god! Are you okay? Look!

54:06.660 --> 54:07.866
Poor thing.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.176
Radu!

54:23.427 --> 54:24.712
Yes, master.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.211
Is hunyadi in the lab?
I have no time to check.

54:27.222 --> 54:28.632
I'm being followed, master.

54:28.974 --> 54:31.932
Radu, you're my friend
for 20 years. I love you.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.721
Please, don't call
me master anymore.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.727
Yes, ma... - That's good.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.106
Master.

54:38.984 --> 54:40.474
Well, maybe next time. Let's go.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.372
Thank you, radu.
You're very kind.

54:56.335 --> 54:58.291
You two are both
so helpful to me.

54:59.922 --> 55:02.789
Well, I'm all ready.

55:04.635 --> 55:05.875
Let's get to work.

55:29.952 --> 55:31.692
It's good to be home.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.537
My friends.

55:45.717 --> 55:47.503
Pompous percek.

55:48.387 --> 55:52.255
He thinks I'm satisfied with
just playing with white mice?

55:52.766 --> 55:54.302
Iitzy to fritzy, mitzy to fritzy!

55:54.810 --> 55:59.179
He thinks he can snuff
out the creative genius

55:59.189 --> 56:02.852
of the great victorio malavaqua?

56:03.235 --> 56:06.068
Mitzy, vitzy! Mitzy and vitzy.

56:06.071 --> 56:08.232
Shut up, you lowlife! =I'm low.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.652
I'm lower. - Yes!

56:12.202 --> 56:13.202
Yes!

56:14.913 --> 56:17.529
How dare they make
fun of my father.

56:17.833 --> 56:20.199
My father was a great scientist.

56:22.004 --> 56:24.586
He devoted his whole
life to try to cure

56:24.590 --> 56:27.548
the common cold by
injecting foreign viruses.

56:27.968 --> 56:30.084
And instead of being
honored for that...

56:31.054 --> 56:35.138
He's remembered as the man
who brought herpes to sicily.

56:37.603 --> 56:39.013
Don't worry, papa.

56:39.354 --> 56:42.812
My work will clear the
name of malavaqua forever!

56:44.902 --> 56:47.314
Hunyadi!

56:49.156 --> 56:51.522
Do not know.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.898
I don't know either!

56:52.910 --> 56:54.866
I tell you two to
keep an eye on them!

56:54.870 --> 56:57.031
And he's out scaring the
hell out of everybody!

56:57.414 --> 56:59.575
It's difficult working two jobs.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.865
Sure!

57:00.876 --> 57:04.414
It's more important to
feed those pigs upstairs!

57:04.838 --> 57:08.046
How dare they turn
this magnificent castle

57:08.258 --> 57:10.749
into a haven to
titillate tourists!

57:10.761 --> 57:12.592
I hate it! - You hate it what?

57:12.804 --> 57:14.760
I hate it a lot!
You hate a lot, what?

57:14.765 --> 57:16.175
You hate it a lot, master.

57:16.183 --> 57:18.094
I hate it a lot, master.

57:18.101 --> 57:19.216
That's better. - Thank you.

57:19.227 --> 57:20.933
You're welcome.
You're welcome, what?

57:20.938 --> 57:23.304
You're welcome, master.
= shut up, you two!

57:23.482 --> 57:25.143
You matrimonial masochists!

57:25.317 --> 57:28.309
You found each other, but
you can't find anybody else!

57:31.823 --> 57:33.563
What are you laughing at?

57:33.575 --> 57:37.159
The joke is on you, you
stupid... get to work!

57:37.162 --> 57:38.743
This place is a mess! Clean up!

57:38.956 --> 57:40.537
Wash up! Clean up the floors!

57:40.540 --> 57:42.747
I got to work. Where's my notes?

57:42.751 --> 57:44.833
I got to get my notes!

57:50.425 --> 57:52.586
Lupi, radu,
please, don't work so hard.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.004
Sit down. Take a rest.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.886
This is your coffee break.
Sit down, please.

57:56.890 --> 57:58.551
Relax. Go ahead.

57:59.226 --> 58:00.557
That's nice. That's nice.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.810
Would you like some Espresso?
No, thanks.

58:04.940 --> 58:05.940
Okay...

58:07.109 --> 58:08.189
Are you crazy?

58:08.902 --> 58:10.517
What the hell are you doing? Get up!

58:10.529 --> 58:12.736
When there's so much of work
to do, you sit down on a job?

58:12.739 --> 58:14.570
What do you take me for? A sucker?

58:24.876 --> 58:25.911
Odette?

58:28.588 --> 58:30.169
Where's... - Where's odette?

58:31.925 --> 58:33.711
Where's my odette?

58:34.302 --> 58:36.418
What am I running here?
An outpatient clinic?

58:36.430 --> 58:38.261
I have to let them
do what they want.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.596
They are my masters.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.848
What? Is everybody your
master, you cockroach?

58:41.852 --> 58:42.967
I'm not.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.427
Shut up!
Now, you're both going to get it good.

58:45.439 --> 58:46.519
You want to get it good?

58:46.523 --> 58:47.683
Wait, wait.

58:47.858 --> 58:50.065
You're favorite. He, she is still here.

58:50.485 --> 58:51.600
Believe me.

58:52.571 --> 58:53.651
My favorite.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.362
My favorite's here?

58:56.366 --> 58:57.572
Quick, quick.

58:57.951 --> 58:59.282
Well, check up on the animals.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.902
I've got to see how my
experiments are coming up. Quick!

59:01.913 --> 59:04.074
My experiments. My favorite.

59:04.416 --> 59:05.997
Alive. Alive.

59:06.168 --> 59:07.704
Alive. Alive.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.831
Dead. - I know that.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.704
All right. = alive.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.498
Alive. Alive.

59:15.093 --> 59:17.004
Dead. - Alive!

59:17.012 --> 59:18.968
Dead. - He's alive!

59:20.307 --> 59:21.717
Come on.

59:21.975 --> 59:22.975
Come.

59:23.894 --> 59:24.894
Come on.

59:26.980 --> 59:27.980
Dead!

59:28.106 --> 59:30.097
Seven alive, two dead.

59:31.068 --> 59:33.855
Seven alive, two dead.

59:35.989 --> 59:39.231
Soon you'll be perfect,
my favorite one.

59:39.409 --> 59:40.615
Does this hurt?

59:40.619 --> 59:41.825
Does this hurt?

59:41.828 --> 59:43.659
Does this hurt? Does this hurt?

59:44.498 --> 59:46.204
Good, everything hurts.

59:47.626 --> 59:49.708
It's time to get to work.

59:52.631 --> 59:54.997
Do you want to wait
for lightning, master?

59:56.301 --> 59:59.088
I don't work with lightning.
I hate it! Ptchoo!

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.299
I work with all this other shit!

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:20.531
Look, Elizabeth, we're both,
uh, really on vacation now.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.242
I et's look at life as adults.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:28.789
We're alone in
unfamiliar territory...

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.496
Sharing the same,
uh, environment...

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.456
Sharing the same air.

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:42.794
Go ahead, I'm listening.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:43.966
That's okay, I'll wait.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.014
You want some?

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.470
No, thanks.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.594
Jack, Jack, Jack!

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:52.095
I've been looking
all over for you. Hi!

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.268
Hi. - What is it now?

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.733
Uh, can I talk to you alone? I'm sorry.
No, no.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:57.771
Go ahead, Jack.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.111
I got to go find Laura before
she wanders too far off.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:01.446
Sorry, Elizabeth. Thank you.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.941
This better be good. - Okay.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.068
This better be good.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.240
I was following radu,
when out of nowhere,

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.284
I was accosted by a lady Dracula.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.829
She was half-naked and she
nearly swallowed my face.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:16.586
What? Is she here? Here?

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.959
Here, here. You know, Gil.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.084
I don't blame you anymore.
I blame myself.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.881
I'm the one who came along
in this misguided mission.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.174
No. It's not.
The infantile stupidity.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.718
First the chief of
police attacks you.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:28.886
He did. The thing swang by my face.
I'm sure, it swang by your face.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.930
Yeah. Then we go to a gypsy camp.
Some phony gypsy camp.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.473
It's the story of your life.
That was a legitimate lead.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.890
Turns us both into peeping Toms.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.436
And last night, the avon lady strikes.
Oh, it's so spooky.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.604
The minute you come in, she's gone.
Right when you...

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.227
And now, today, a woman,
uh, eats your head.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.694
Not a woman. The same woman!
What are you trying to do?

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.359
You want to kill me? You want to kill you?
No, I love you, Jack.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.947
You love me?
If this is love, hate me, please,

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.657
because I hate your guts.
1 don't hate you.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.276
For 35 years,
I've washed your clothes.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:49.368
Don't choke me like that.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.657
Listen to your stories.
I've put up with your crap.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.371
No, frank, come on!
That's too tight!

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.911
Now, we're here, I'm
going to wring your neck.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:54.954
No, Elizabeth!

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.207
Laura! I aura!

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.081
Okay, okay.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:02.127
Get up.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.592
I swear you'll kill me.
You okay?

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.465
Okay. - Fine.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.843
Fine? You okay? = I'm fine.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.017
Okay.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:11.971
Were you angry?
Good. Was I angry?

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.060
Were you angry? - Was I angry?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.975
Yes. - No I wasn't angry.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:17.934
Why did you do that? - Why?

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:19.103
Yeah. - Here, look!

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.522
What are you doing?
Get him off me.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.305
I aura?

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.057
I aura!

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.723
Laura, it's your mommy!

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.958
I aura!

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.681
Jack! I can't find Laura. What?

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:35.352
What happened?

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:38.428
Where did you go?
Which way did she go?

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.396
Laura! Make a circle.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.106
Laura!

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:53.902
I aura!

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.747
I aura!

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:11.170
I aura!

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:12.591
I aura!

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:14.339
My god, where is she?

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.675
Look, this area is too much.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.681
Go to town and get the police.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.434
No, I want to
stay here and look.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.851
No, somebody has to go to town.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.606
Then him?

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.101
He can cover more
ground than you can.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.524
Go ahead.
Don't worry. We'll find her.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.281
Okay. - Okay.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.778
But I'll be right back.

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:36.202
Go that way. Yeah.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:38.989
I aura!

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.046
I aura!

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:58.929
I aura!

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:03.684
I aura!

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:54.606
Help me! Help me!

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.950
Somebody help me!
Help me somebody!

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.238
Help me!

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.949
Help me! Help me!

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.906
Help me! Help...

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:18.971
I aura!

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520
Jack!

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.762
Gil, where are you?

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.991
Down, boy, down.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.286
Eh, can we talk?

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.617
Can you talk?

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:56.634
The wolfman.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.015
Jack!

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.011
Do you believe me now?

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:06.890
Take me home!

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:13.772
Did you see him?

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.649
Who?
The wolfman grabbed my friend.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.569
Tell it to the marines.
No, no. He attacked me.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.449
Arrest him. - What?

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.906
Meddling in police affairs.
No, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:24.245
There's a little girl
lost in these words.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:25.929
And these woods are
full of god knows what.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.407
It's getting out of control.
What are we going to do now?

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:31.245
Now, we are going
to the wine festival.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:33.747
The wine festival? At a time like this?
Take him away.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.208
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.460
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.587
Inspector percek,
don't you think it's time

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.931
that we alert the townspeople
to the danger surrounding us?

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:49.388
That's exactly
what we must not do!

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.895
Don't forget, when
we were children,

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:59.193
the streets echoed with
cries of Frankenstein!

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.949
People boarded up their homes.

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:04.944
Women and children
were afraid to go out.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:08.365
That must not happen again.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.661
He'll be all right, master.
I gave him a shot.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.503
Why did you bring him here?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.836
All right!
Back off that growling crap!

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.508
I've been trying to listen here!

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.883
He's okay.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.430
Now, why did you bring
this guy here, huh?

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.053
I couldn't get the
dude off my back.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.349
What were you doing
out there to begin with?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.517
I was taking a whiz.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.185
Why did you attack
that other guy?

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:36.729
He scared me.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.435
He scared you?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.733
You look like this!

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:40.981
And he scared...
Get the hell out of here!

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.734
Get him back in the cage
before I send him to the pound!

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:50.661
Hey, doc, you know, I think
I like the pound better.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:53.330
You ungrateful bonehead!

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.258
Come here, come here!
Let me pull that thing off!

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.380
You can't get me in here.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.965
Dig your frizzy hairdo, doc.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.718
Hey, hey, hey, you pretzel!

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.133
Hey, twisto! Come over here.
= twisto.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.062
How come you grabbed this
reporter by the cojones?

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.729
He stepped on me.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.649
He stepped on me!
He stepped on me!

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.611
Come on, doc. Over here.
Shut up!

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.071
Up yours, hairy!

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.532
I'll tear every bit of hair
you have out of your ass.

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.783
Now, you all had your
nice little excuses,

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:28.243
and I'm the one
who's in the soup!

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:31.225
Now, what am I going to do what
this, uh, this meddling reporter?

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.957
Don't hurt him, please?

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.456
My bloodshot beauty speaks up.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.502
She doesn't want me to hurt him.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.636
What do you want?
A quickie before dinner?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.421
I want him.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:50.015
I need him. I love him.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.303
Oh, oh, I love him
so much, it hurts.

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:55.680
What do you know
about love, nymphonies?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.188
If I didn't have you chained to the
wall, no man in this town would be safe.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.435
Stop that! I'm your doctor!

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:01.982
Get against the wall!

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.569
Now, listen to me, all of you.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.739
The police are breathing
down on my neck.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.579
From now on, I don't want
anybody to leave this lab.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:16.951
You hear? Anyone!

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.879
And you, you infectious
incompetent bug,

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.342
you have any idea
where hunyadi is?

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.300
I have a hunch.
I know you got a hunch!

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:29.763
But you know where hunyadi is?

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.008
I do. He's in the abandoned stable.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.099
Well, go find him. Quick!

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.224
How long are you going
to keep me in here?

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.778
It could be...
How do you Americans say:

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.274
"Until the cows come home.”

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.499
Sorry.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:11:00.252
Elizabeth. What did you do?
Your daughter... stop.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:01.955
Why did they put you in here?

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.082
Where's Laura?
And where's your friend?

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.379
Well... - Answer me!

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.753
Okay, okay.
And where are all the police?

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.762
That I can answer.
They took the night off.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.968
They took the night off? = yeah.

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:16.935
What kind of a place is this?
They should be out there

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:19.146
looking for my daughter.
They're at the wine festival.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.106
The wine festival. - Yeah.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.194
Then I'm going there
to beat a few heads.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.526
Well, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.071
Hey, I'll meet you in town.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:36.705
Madame morovia, I got to talk to you.
It's urgent.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.576
I didn't believe your story before
about the wolfman, but now I do.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:43.539
When the full moon rises...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Never mind that.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.505
We followed Lawrence
malbot under the full moon.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.922
But he turned out to be a
guy making out with a girl.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.385
That was my husband.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.717
He is a wolf.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.306
My son is the wolfman.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.266
Oh, okay, well, where is he?
He's got my friend.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.510
There's a child missing.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.389
The answer lies in
the secret passageway

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:02.560
under the bridge of the castle.
Bridge?

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.894
Jump off and swim
to the embankment.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.942
There's no water under there.
Then don't jump off.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:13.243
Walk under it, and
you will find a door.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.746
I sleep now.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.651
Full house.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.428
You got him! You got him!

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:23.597
Shut up! I'm working.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.557
I knew you could
do it all along.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.444
I'll get the rope.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.780
I feel like throwing up.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.583
I think he's throwing up.
Yuck! Monster breath!

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.204
And take this! Take this!

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.672
Take it again! Take it again!

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.003
He's weakening.

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.504
Call his mother!

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.322
I got him! I got him!

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.619
You big bully.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.209
Now, your knees are
in a lot of trouble.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.709
This... this is cowww caca.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:38.342
You lumping monster!

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:45.394
My gloves! My gloves! My gloves!

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.975
Are you alive?

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.276
I had better days.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.816
Move over.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.485
Nice.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:00.036
Okay...

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.907
Come on, now. Hold on.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.124
We got to hurry.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.966
It's so good to have you
back where you belong.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.139
Look at your ears.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:20.967
They're completely rusted.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.007
I've got a lot of
work to do on you yet.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:25.847
Yes, master.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.559
And when you're finished
with him, you can help me.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:32.479
Me! Me! Me!
All you ever think about is "me"!

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:35.690
You're right, master.
I will not talk of me anymore.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:38.359
How are you?

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.272
It's over.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.148
You madman! What have you done?

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.486
Well, you, what are you
doing in my laboratory?

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.151
You killed him.
He's under sedation.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:21.274
We took a pint of blood.
Ab positive.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.154
Oh, oh, Gil, thank god.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.572
Okay, malavaqua,
where's the little girl?

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.162
What a story.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:32.580
Story?

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.413
There'll be no stories until
my experiments are completed.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.504
Radu, attack!

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.921
Master, I've had enough
aggravation for one day.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.213
I said attack! = all right.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.631
Get him.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.064
I got you now, you communist.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.564
My, my, my pinkie!

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:05.488
Oh, thank you!

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:06.906
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.245
Help! Help!

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.168
God!

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.161
All right.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.412
You want to play rough.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:17.583
Take this!

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.255
Yah!

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:23.419
Time you've had enough, eh?

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.510
How about this one!

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.968
Where are you going?

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.557
Get the girl!

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.475
Come on! Come on, big guy!

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:33.016
You big... come on! No-good bum!

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.768
Never mind me.
Do something about malavaqua.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.266
The only way to stop his madness

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.609
is to get him out of the lab.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.479
Jack! Get him... get him out!
Get him out of the lab!

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.446
You rat! You would murder my work!

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.447
Oh, what have I done?

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.862
This is... this is embarrassing.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.074
Are you... are you all right?

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:53.999
Who are you?
Would you like some Espresso?

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.868
Ra... radu, are you ok?

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.334
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you, fart-butt!

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.922
And you're not going
to ruin my work!

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.717
Are you okay?

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.053
Are you sure you, uh,
wouldn't like some Espresso?

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:08.342
I could make some... for you!
I'll kill you!

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.806
I'll eat your eyeballs!

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.017
You no-good... ah! Ah!

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.728
Here, undo this. Let me go.
Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:17.223
Not my pants!
This belt! This belt!

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.353
Where is she, doctor?

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.485
It was hunyadi.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.111
But he meant her no harm.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.446
He just found her
wandering in the woods.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.987
No harm? Her mother's in town,
worried sick about her.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.044
Hold on. Hold on a minute.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:40.962
Here she is. She's fine.

01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:42.498
No, don't! Don't you... ugh!

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.343
Please, he's too strong for you!

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.016
Wait, wait!

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.100
I know where he's going.

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:56.561
He's taking the little girl to her mother.
We must get to town.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.325
I'll explain everything
to you along the way.

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:09.426
Oh, yeah. I'm going into town.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.143
I'm sleepy.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:40.998
This I don't believe.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.710
You're sitting
here, guzzling wine

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.500
while my daughter
is still missing.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.414
Ms. Ellison, calm yourself.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.130
We shall look for her
after the festival.

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.429
Oh, no. You get up!

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.886
And you look for her now!

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.849
What are you doing?
What's going on?

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:02.892
It's crazy!

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:10.863
Frankenstein!

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.412
The monster has returned!

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:26.787
She's dead!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
He has my daughter!

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:37.388
Baby.

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:55.448
I aura.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:56.532
I aura.

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:57.993
Mommy. - Baby!

01:21:57.996 --> 01:21:59.657
Mommy. - Baby.

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:04.742
You're all right.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.341
Don't let that monster get away.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.765
His enemy is fire.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:26.517
Light the torches.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:36.194
Burn him.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:08.889
Light the fire.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:14.941
Stop! Stop! What are you, crazy?
Give me that thing!

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.191
Oh, gosh. How are you?
Are you okay?

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:20.113
Oh, we're fine.
Thank god, you're here.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.735
You won't believe
what's been happening.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.203
He's Frankenstein!

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.996
He must be destroyed!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.490
He's not Frankenstein!

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:28.834
He is. Look at him!
No, please, please, everybody!

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.668
Listen to me!
This is not Frankenstein.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.672
He's one of us.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:33.418
That's Kurt hunyadi!

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:34.840
Nonsense!

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:39.211
This monster is one
of his experiments.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:42.256
The product of a demented mind.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.132
That's not true! = grab him!

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.853
He's got a demented mind! Not me!

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.393
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
= don't listen to him.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.435
This is a mistake.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.354
Foreigners, they
know nothing about us.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:54.362
Go get him!

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.406
This is a bad time.
Come on, get him!

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.868
Get back, or I'll cut you!

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:13.207
Back! - That hurts.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:14.751
Oh, okay, come on!

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.674
Come on! You want to eat some glass?

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:18.844
Huh?

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.507
Go ahead. Go ahead!

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.423
Please, please, everybody!
You all got to hear something.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.307
Let's hear what he has to say!

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.226
Yeah! Let's listen to him!

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.396
Yes, let's hear him out!

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.890
Yeah!

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.234
This man is Kurt hunyadi.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:39.439
After a car accident,
his body was mangled

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:40.905
and he was partially paralyzed.

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:44.027
But some people
here in your town

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.322
couldn't stand the sight of him.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:48.906
So they had him transferred
from intensive care

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.033
to your phony rest home.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.378
Where I performed
reconstructive surgery.

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:58.749
Yes, with wire and
pipes and nuts and bolts.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.045
What can I do?

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:01.422
They take the money...

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.717
That the government
gives them to fix him up.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:06.973
And they put it in his pocket!

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:08.144
Yes!

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.136
Who would do such a lousy thing?

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:12.732
Who?

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:15.474
Yes! Who would do that?

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:16.645
Who?

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:20.441
It was your police
and your mayor.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.984
They even ordered
Dr. malavaqua to pull the plug!

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:28.119
It was a compassionate decision.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:31.160
But no, he wouldn't
listen to me.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.998
And look at the
beast he created.

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:42.502
Are you going to take the word of a
madman and a fugitive from justice?

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.546
No! No! No! - I mean yes!

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:46.763
You should take the word.

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.428
Of course, not. - Take my word.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.675
Gil! - Is he crazy?

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:50.686
He gets confused.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:56.936
What? Are you crazy?
Shut up, old man!

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:57.978
These is stupid. Hey!

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:18.329
There, inside this car, more
of malavaqua's handiwork!

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.876
The proofs are those creatures!

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:22.879
You want these things
living in your town?

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.001
I ook at this!

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.798
Eating in your restaurants?
= no!

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.263
And what about this monster?

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.975
Wolfman! - Not the wolfman.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.348
This is Lawrence malbot Jr.

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:37.855
That's Larry? - No, it's my son!

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.020
It is! Ltis! This is Larry malbot!

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:43.195
He has a rare condition
called hypertrichosis.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.272
I started growing hair.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.615
It grew. It grew.

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:49.575
It wouldn't stop growing.

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:52.286
I've been trying to give him
electrolysis treatments. Show them!

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:55.501
See?

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.458
I can go to the beach now.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:27:02.206
Yes. But you see, unfortunately,
Larry's mother, madame morovia,

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:05.709
spread these lies about
Larry because, you see,

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.212
she is ashamed
that he is her son.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.556
Junior.

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:14.426
I'm sorry.

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:18.139
Please forgive me.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.061
Ah, you stink.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.283
It's a mummy.

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:31.944
It's alive!

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:33.661
Radu, lupi, quick!

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:34.825
Come cut the bandages.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:42.458
Okay, now.
Do you all remember ugly Hattie?

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.924
The girl had been
dipped in the ugly pond.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.667
Remember how she used to look?
Show them.

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:54.971
That's enough.
So you keep her in a coffin?

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:56.437
Sick.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.269
After the intensive
plastic surgery,

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:00.184
I had to keep herin a
high oxygen environment.

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.103
But now, she's
ready to come out.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.189
She's beautiful. - Wait!

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.117
Wait, there's more.
I also gave her a body lift.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:19.749
Bazoonkers!

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:22.874
I never counted on bazoonkers.

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:25.751
I am so content.

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.295
You should be. = don't look.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:33.426
Very nice. Indeed.

01:28:34.935 --> 01:28:39.895
But then your cosmetic
fakery deal is this...

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.647
Freak of nature.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.480
This lowly, stooped-over
geek was allowed

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.979
to fornicate with
one of his own kind.

01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:51.523
Just look...

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:57.989
At the offspring
created by such an ugly union.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.576
Daddy, mommy!

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.956
Daddy, what is he
saying about me?

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:09.962
Now, wait a minute.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.301
You can say all
you want about me,

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:15.547
but when it comes to my
son, I draw the line.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.724
We've taken a lot of
garbage for a long time.

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:20.514
Yes, master. No, master.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.721
And we've put up
with it, haven't we?

01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:24.688
Yes, master.

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:27.434
We're sick and tired of it.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.650
How dare you pick on my son?

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.985
And your wife.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:35.984
My lovely wife.

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:38.991
Radu.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:43.409
And we deserve some respect!

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:48.872
Stand up straight.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:09.184
Radu, lupi, from now on,
I want to be good to you two all the time.

01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:12.399
No, no, no, no. Just kidding.
I was just kidding.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:13.692
I love you. I love you.

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:17.200
You were wohderful.

01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:20.491
Me? If it wasn't for you, I'd be
investigating the transylvania

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.113
penal system from the inside.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.240
However...

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:28.082
We're not going to be
needing this... anymore.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:33.375
Odette, would you come on out?

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.714
No. - Okay, fine.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:39.631
What are you doing sitting here?

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.058
Kiss me. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:30:42.062 --> 01:30:43.518
Why don't you take
these out first?

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:44.521
You know why?

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:46.138
Because you're not a vampire.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:47.810
Oh, I know.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.937
But it gets me attention.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:51.606
You don't need that
kind of attention.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:52.898
Yes, I do.

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.737
I'm ugly.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:56.864
How can you say that?
You're gorgeous.

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.153
Look at my nose.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:00.989
Your nose is perfect.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:03.913
I gave her a nose job.

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:09.661
You are beautiful.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:12.251
No, I'm not. =you are.

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.013
I et's dance.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:22.386
I'll lead.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:25.142
Gill

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:27.600
I can't believe it!
Look at all this!

01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:30.064
What a story!
But who the hell's going to believe it?

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:32.601
They'll believe it!

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:37.072
My father will have a field
day with these pictures!
