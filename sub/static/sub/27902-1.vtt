00:48.923 --> 00:52.719
Your life is
your own little boat.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.028
I would admit that

01:11.029 --> 01:13.198
this degree of criminality

01:14.741 --> 01:19.369
is something that I had
never really imagined but

01:19.370 --> 01:21.080
we do the best we can

01:21.081 --> 01:23.624
with the tools that
we have at hand.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.625
Yeah?

01:42.852 --> 01:45.270
I want you to get comfy, okay?

01:45.271 --> 01:49.274
Because you're gonna
be in this apparatus

01:49.275 --> 01:50.693
for a day or two.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.278
Provided your little man friend

01:53.279 --> 01:57.117
is able to come up with
the money that I need.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.036
I'll tell you what,

02:01.287 --> 02:03.206
I will take out the gag

02:04.624 --> 02:08.085
tomorrow when we get
away from the shore.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.630
If you're good, if you're good.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.470
Now, I've never understood
people like you.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.475
You're so committed to this

02:24.060 --> 02:28.063
this very certain idea
of right and wrong

02:28.064 --> 02:30.567
and it's just very inflexible.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.568
You know?

02:34.112 --> 02:37.823
My own mother, she was
exactly the same way,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.243
she wouldn't let anything go.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.078
It was a shame

02:43.079 --> 02:45.873
because she didn't
have to be that way

02:45.874 --> 02:48.000
but it might not be
too late for you.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.475
Don't stay up all night gabbing.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.454
Four door,
and the license plate,

03:21.478 --> 03:23.493
last seen south
bound, Woolley Avenue.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.040
Has been two hours, no
further information.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.042
Here you go.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.001
Thank you.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.002
Of course.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.389
Where are you staying?

03:46.059 --> 03:49.395
I just came straight
from the airport.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.358
Augy's place, I guess.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.235
Can I go up there?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.028
Absolutely.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.614
It's not being treated
as a crime scene.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.117
Pretty sure he fell or jumped.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.916
But it was his birthday,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.337
he wasn't a sad boy.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.591
I'm very sorry for
your loss, ma'am.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.759
I am.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.262
But his

04:25.598 --> 04:29.101
emotional state
isn't something that

04:29.102 --> 04:31.104
we can... Of course not.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.107
It'll take 10 days or so

04:35.650 --> 04:37.819
for the paperwork to clear

04:40.113 --> 04:43.991
and then you'll be able to
collect his personal affects.

04:43.992 --> 04:44.826
Okay.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.826
Alright.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.496
My card.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.583
Thanks.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.418
Yeah, the bottom's my cell,

04:53.419 --> 04:55.335
you can call me
any time you want.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.838
And you could just

04:58.798 --> 05:01.925
sign the bottom
here, where the X is,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.595
it's for the coroner to release.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.533
Can I help you?

05:26.534 --> 05:27.909
I'm Anna Ellison,

05:27.910 --> 05:30.913
I'm the mother of
the tenant in 520.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.291
August, yeah.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.292
I'm,

05:37.003 --> 05:38.546
I'm Jonas, I'm the,

05:40.673 --> 05:41.883
please come in.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.565
So, did you know August?

05:58.566 --> 06:02.528
I try not to get too
personal with my, I mean,

06:06.532 --> 06:10.369
I knew him enough to
know he was a good kid.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.455
He didn't seem like that.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.750
You mean, after he.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.922
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't talk about it, so.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.428
It must be strange,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.057
strange situation.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.230
It is.

06:44.987 --> 06:45.988
Thank you.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.173
No, please, leave
the lights off.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.220
Okay, so,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.723
take your time.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.185
Stay as long as you want to.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.606
I'll be at the front
desk if you need to,

07:23.860 --> 07:24.860
anything.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.614
I'll just leave the key here.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.201
Thanks.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.343
Oh, you're eating,

09:55.344 --> 09:56.469
I'll come back another time.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.764
No no no, it's no trouble.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.309
Are you hungry?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.226
You look hungry.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.520
I don't want to
interrupt your evening.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.273
No no no, it's
nothing like that.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
I always order too much.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.781
Here, let's go to my office.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.334
So you live here?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.420
I keep a room upstairs but

10:30.421 --> 10:34.592
it's mostly just a bed and
a closet and a bathroom.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.845
This is where the days unfold.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.682
I sleep on the
couch often enough.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.898
I'd like to stay for a
while, if that's okay?

10:49.899 --> 10:50.733
In his room.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.567
As long as you like.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.236
You can just keep that key.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.237
Thanks.

11:00.785 --> 11:04.996
So you manage this
whole place by yourself?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.166
Yeah, keeps me occupied.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.335
It's my old man,

11:10.336 --> 11:12.505
was my old man's building.

11:15.966 --> 11:19.011
So you must know
the tenants a bit,

11:20.721 --> 11:22.514
know their lives.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.225
Most are pretty private.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.396
I only knew your son
in a passing way.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.816
Friendly kid.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.653
Yeah, he was always like that.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.034
I haven't seen him
in over a year.

11:43.619 --> 11:47.373
Sad about time, takes
apart our intentions.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.713
I need to know him better,

11:55.297 --> 11:56.966
know about his life.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.222
He enjoyed company.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.392
Never late on his rent.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.105
Seemed happy.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.065
Company?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.067
Friends.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.613
Lots of friends.

12:22.616 --> 12:26.119
You know, you
should talk to Juan.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.288
He, they were,

12:29.832 --> 12:30.832
you know,

12:33.711 --> 12:34.711
friends.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.881
Together, you mean?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.591
They were together?

12:39.592 --> 12:40.592
I think.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.430
Like I said, I
can't tell you much.

12:50.644 --> 12:54.565
There's a memorial service
flier above my desk.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.320
Are you going to attend?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.489
I try not to

13:03.449 --> 13:06.201
involve myself in
the personal lives

13:06.202 --> 13:07.453
of the tenants.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.582
You already mentioned that.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.085
Thank you for, for this.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.757
I just can't.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.886
Don't worry about it, it's okay.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.570
It's good to see the
community coming together

13:42.571 --> 13:46.325
to honor August and also
support one another.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.664
But we're here to
celebrate a beautiful life.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.582
I wanna begin

13:54.583 --> 13:58.002
with a poem that
feels like August.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.880
It's called The Palm
at the End of the Mind.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.633
We're all here today because

14:03.634 --> 14:04.802
we loved Augy.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.933
He was immensely
lovable, radiant.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.021
A person with no meanness in him

14:17.022 --> 14:19.190
and the rest of us, we,

14:19.191 --> 14:22.485
we couldn't help but
wanna be close to him

14:22.486 --> 14:24.530
to have him in our lives.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.741
The thing about it is,

14:28.742 --> 14:32.204
that that boy's heart
was perfectly clean

14:33.289 --> 14:34.455
and that's what made him

14:34.456 --> 14:36.792
so impossible to hold on to.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.671
That,

14:43.924 --> 14:46.719
that strange purity,
that radiance

14:48.095 --> 14:51.932
kept him at a certain
distance from all of us.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.979
We couldn't keep
him for ourselves,

14:57.980 --> 15:00.566
any of us, as much as we tried.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.863
You can't keep light in a box.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.078
We love you Augy.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.919
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, of course.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.837
Thank you for,

15:22.838 --> 15:25.341
for doing that, it was lovely.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.427
It gives me great
comfort to know

15:29.428 --> 15:31.013
that he had so many

15:32.014 --> 15:34.432
people who cared about him.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.809
He was well loved.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.898
I wish I had been able
to come down more often.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.734
Well, some of us are heading

15:44.735 --> 15:47.612
over to a bar Augy used to like.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.907
Why don't you join
us for a toast?

15:50.908 --> 15:52.909
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.328
- Thank you.
- Of course.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.329
Okay.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.040
I'll wait.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
Sure.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.462
And we got to Lake Park,

16:04.463 --> 16:05.838
right as the moon was coming out

16:05.839 --> 16:08.132
from behind the clouds

16:08.133 --> 16:10.551
and Augy gave me that crazy grin

16:10.552 --> 16:12.470
and hopped off his bike.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.805
And I was like, Augy no.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.808
It's too cold, but he
just tore off his shirt

16:16.809 --> 16:18.851
and ran right into the water

16:18.852 --> 16:20.770
and because it was
Augy, I followed him.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.772
What an adventure.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.108
All August and I
ever did was screw.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.485
You're an asshole.

16:27.486 --> 16:31.657
You know, Juan, you make
jealousy look sophisticated.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.160
I have to take some
responsibility for that.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.121
Whatever, they still would
have found each other

16:38.145 --> 16:39.789
if you weren't around.

16:39.790 --> 16:44.711
Well maybe Sean was different
when they were alone.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
I hope he was.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.132
I feel sorry for him.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.301
Augy and I had something
Sean couldn't ever understand

16:52.302 --> 16:55.346
and I think it makes
him a little crazy.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.474
So you also dated Augy?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.854
He was the love of my life.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.147
Excuse me.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.111
He needs an agent.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.321
August dated him
for a couple weeks,

17:13.323 --> 17:16.034
right at the end, it
was nothing serious.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.036
Sean, no that was serious.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.454
They were together
for over a year

17:20.455 --> 17:22.999
and broke up about a month ago.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.002
Juan was just a rebound.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.715
Augy never even
told me he was gay.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.509
Did you ever ask him?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.011
No.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.180
He liked women too.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.183
He liked people and sex.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.394
Augy had a gift for making you
feel like he cared about you.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.939
Instantly, whether
or not it was true.

17:46.940 --> 17:51.277
Would you tell me more
about his life here?

17:51.278 --> 17:53.738
I'll give you my number.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.116
In the meantime, can I
get you another drink?

17:57.117 --> 18:00.370
Just ginger ale this
time, thank you.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.918
He's here you know.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.089
All you have to do
is think about him.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.593
All I have been doing
is thinking about him.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.013
But it doesn't change things.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.431
I know.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.102
I think there's more

18:24.103 --> 18:28.273
to this world than people
will allow themselves to see.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.195
Just try to clear your
mind and picture him.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.616
And then focus on that
image in your heart and

18:38.617 --> 18:42.411
ask questions, listen
for the answers.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.746
Sounds simple but,

18:43.747 --> 18:46.124
you gotta be open to it.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.502
It's more than just
an act of faith,

18:49.503 --> 18:51.171
it's an act of will.

19:09.523 --> 19:13.109
Hey, I wanted to thank
you again for everything.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.485
You know, he was happy,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.779
you know, he was perfectly
happy and living his life.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.867
I saw him at his
birthday, so I just,

19:20.993 --> 19:23.828
I don't why they believe this.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.038
He didn't jump.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.541
What are you saying?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.209
I'm not saying anything.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.378
I would hate to accuse anyone.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.713
Accuse who?

19:33.714 --> 19:35.339
I don't know, I
don't know anything,

19:35.340 --> 19:38.010
except that Augy would not jump.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.303
Not him.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Not him.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.348
Sorry.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.979
I'm sorry I keep barging
in on you like this.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.357
Mac said it was my worst habit.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.858
Your husband?

20:35.859 --> 20:36.859
My ex.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.737
Have you told him?

20:39.738 --> 20:40.738
No.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.199
He wasn't Augy's father

20:43.200 --> 20:45.369
and they were never close.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.748
He wouldn't do anyone
any good here anyway.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.805
It wasn't a suicide, you know.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.224
What?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.060
It wasn't a suicide.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.604
How do you know?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.524
He wasn't the type.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.945
No matter how hard
things got for him,

21:20.946 --> 21:22.864
he never would give up,

21:23.949 --> 21:25.617
he wasn't a quitter.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.789
And then his friend Eric,
he said something to me

21:31.790 --> 21:35.961
that he didn't, he didn't
believe that Augy jumped.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.052
And I don't believe it either.

21:45.470 --> 21:49.641
I think I might something
a little stronger than tea.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.914
But, detective I,

22:56.208 --> 23:00.295
I just feel like you
haven't taken into consider,

23:03.715 --> 23:05.716
no, never, this is the thing,

23:05.717 --> 23:07.719
I never knew Augy to be,

23:10.680 --> 23:12.933
yes I understand, I'm just.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.395
Yes,

23:17.396 --> 23:18.396
I will.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.815
Yes.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.277
Alright, thanks, bye bye.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.793
Can I show you something?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.338
Is that Augy's computer?

24:26.339 --> 24:27.339
Yeah.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.759
Look, Anna,

24:31.511 --> 24:33.804
I don't think this is something

24:33.805 --> 24:35.974
I should be involved with.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.477
Oh.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.896
Of course.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.482
I'm sorry, I'm not
thinking clearly,

24:44.483 --> 24:45.941
this isn't your problem.

24:45.942 --> 24:49.362
I'm just a little
out of my depth here.

24:50.655 --> 24:54.867
I just need someone to
hear me out on this.

24:54.868 --> 24:55.868
Please.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.582
I can do that.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.293
Thank you.

25:09.549 --> 25:13.178
This was filmed the
night that it happened.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.518
Are you, you're recording this?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.353
Stop.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.688
Happy birthday Augy!

25:27.025 --> 25:29.026
Oh, good, a visit
from the auteur.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.986
How about a wish
for the birthday boy.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.905
I wish that you
would get that thing

25:32.906 --> 25:33.865
out of my face.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.658
It's still luby from
your last porn shoot.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.451
I can't
imagine why he left you.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.537
You look like a
retired catalog model.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.538
Bye!

25:43.500 --> 25:45.584
How about a word
for the birthday boy?

25:45.585 --> 25:47.461
I wish you a peaceful, lovely,

25:47.462 --> 25:50.549
and perfect birthday,
my dear friend.

25:52.008 --> 25:55.178
And here's
my birthday boy.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.249
And does that look like somebody

25:59.273 --> 26:02.518
who's about to take
their own life?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.812
Sometimes mood is different

26:04.813 --> 26:06.731
after things wind down.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.026
Someone had to have
gone back to his place

26:11.027 --> 26:12.861
after the party.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.823
Just to throw him
out the window?

26:15.824 --> 26:17.491
Unless there was an argument,

26:17.492 --> 26:18.994
someone got angry.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.081
That night, did any of neighbors

26:24.082 --> 26:27.960
report hearing any
yelling or any shouting?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.086
There's a couple of feet

26:29.087 --> 26:30.713
of cinder block between them.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.881
Rooms in this whole place,

26:32.882 --> 26:35.552
not a lot of sound gets through.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.598
What about Juan?

26:40.890 --> 26:41.932
Where was he?

26:41.933 --> 26:44.059
Why wasn't he at the party?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.937
I mean, they were dating!

26:46.938 --> 26:49.189
He lives in the building,

26:49.190 --> 26:50.942
probably stepped out.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.445
He lives here?

26:57.282 --> 26:59.784
I mean, his ex Sean was there.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.746
I noticed that.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.460
He was happy.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.837
They were all happy.

27:10.838 --> 27:15.008
I mean, there was all those
people there, it just,

27:16.051 --> 27:18.053
this doesn't make sense.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.598
I suppose,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.311
but what can you do?

27:46.831 --> 27:50.668
Hi, Juan,
it's me, Augy's mom.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.836
Yes, I know.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.004
What do you want?

27:54.005 --> 27:55.964
Well I've been thinking
a lot about Augy,

27:55.965 --> 27:58.008
and if I could just ask
you a few questions.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.219
It's something we
all have to deal with

28:00.220 --> 28:01.679
in our own private ways.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.680
I understand that,

28:02.681 --> 28:04.348
just one question, please.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.229
I don't think I have it
in me, even for that...

28:06.253 --> 28:10.145
The night of my son's
party, where were you?

28:10.146 --> 28:12.232
Why would you ask that?

28:14.359 --> 28:16.360
Look, I'm not
trying to upset you.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.655
But you come to my
door and accuse me.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.407
I have to go to work.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.280
Hey!

29:01.281 --> 29:03.574
Who do you think you are?

29:03.575 --> 29:05.033
What do you want from me?

29:05.034 --> 29:05.910
I'm sorry, I just want to know

29:05.911 --> 29:07.431
where you were the
night of the party,

29:07.432 --> 29:08.432
why you weren't there.

29:08.433 --> 29:09.413
I was at work!

29:09.414 --> 29:11.874
Where were you, ever?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.125
What about that?

29:13.126 --> 29:14.710
I was his family.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.503
I loved him more than any of you

29:16.504 --> 29:18.423
and now I have nothing.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.509
You leave me alone.

29:41.821 --> 29:42.821
Hey.

29:43.865 --> 29:44.865
Hey.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.344
You must be getting
kinda tired of me

29:47.368 --> 29:51.330
just showing up and
barging in like this, huh?

29:51.331 --> 29:53.958
It's kinda nice to be needed.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.793
You okay?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.880
I could use some tea.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.682
I think I may have a suspect.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.727
A suspect?

30:13.645 --> 30:14.645
Who?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.648
Well I went to go talk to Juan.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.317
He was acting, very.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.320
What?

30:23.321 --> 30:24.530
Well I asked him a question

30:24.531 --> 30:26.615
and the way that
he responded was

30:26.616 --> 30:28.659
totally out of proportion,

30:28.660 --> 30:30.495
he just blew up on me.

30:31.996 --> 30:35.999
People get strange when
someone they're close to is.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.335
Well no, that's not all.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.213
I followed him after he left.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.214
Followed?

30:43.216 --> 30:45.050
Jesus, where?

30:45.051 --> 30:48.512
I don't know,
wherever he was going.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.514
But then he saw me and,

30:50.515 --> 30:52.891
well there was a
big confrontation

30:52.892 --> 30:56.019
and he said some
really awful things.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.021
What, did he confess?

30:58.022 --> 31:00.816
No, not in so many words.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.277
He got very very angry.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.528
I mean, his eyes

31:04.529 --> 31:06.738
and if you'd seen the
way he was acting,

31:06.739 --> 31:09.116
it's completely easy to see

31:09.117 --> 31:12.453
how he could be the
type of person who...

31:13.289 --> 31:14.289
Don't.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.164
Don't trick yourself

31:15.165 --> 31:17.583
into believing you
have something here.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.167
What are you saying to me?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.794
You gambled your personal safety

31:20.795 --> 31:23.422
and violated someone's privacy.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.673
You're lecturing me?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.968
What if you were
right about him?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.012
What do you think he
would have done to you?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.764
This was a mistake.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.853
Anna.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.449
Augy are you there?

32:37.997 --> 32:40.124
Honey if you can hear me,

32:44.712 --> 32:47.715
I just wanna know
if you're alright.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.314
I wish I could have
done things right.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.804
Yes?

33:35.805 --> 33:38.849
Hi, Sean, it's me
Anna, Augy's mom.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.518
Of course you are.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.017
Well it's about something

33:43.041 --> 33:44.980
that you said at the
bar the other night.

33:44.981 --> 33:45.857
I mention a lot of things

33:45.858 --> 33:47.691
to a lot of people at
bars when I'm drunk.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.776
So you're gonna have
to narrow it down.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.862
Well, it's your boat.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.240
I was wondering if you
might take me out on it.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.826
Well that's unexpected.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.870
I would like to distribute.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.040
Augy's ashes out over the bay.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.042
Distribute, huh?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.378
It's a lot to ask, I know.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.713
When?

34:09.714 --> 34:11.339
Saturday.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.259
Well I'm both
impressed and put out.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.969
I've probably got to move
a couple things around.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.597
Oh,

34:18.598 --> 34:20.766
sorry I shouldn't have called.

34:20.766 --> 34:24.393
No no no, it's fine,
it's fine, I'm.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.481
I just actually care
about him you know?

34:27.482 --> 34:28.732
Is it alright if I bring Eric

34:28.733 --> 34:30.650
and one other friend with me?

34:30.650 --> 34:31.569
Sure, yeah, why not?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.321
Hey, make it a party.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.489
Eric can give you
the directions.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.657
Noon?

34:37.658 --> 34:40.118
Noon, okay, great.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.661
Hey, listen, thanks a lot,
I really appreciate it.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.916
There's no need for that.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.890
This is so sweet.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.893
I've had it forever.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.312
You want a drink?

35:07.980 --> 35:08.980
Sure.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.534
Thanks.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.662
Augy always had this idea

35:23.663 --> 35:26.748
that people who drank during
the day were alcoholics.

35:26.749 --> 35:30.627
He could do whatever
he wanted after 5 p.m.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.587
I'd call him a hypocrite,

35:31.588 --> 35:36.007
but then he'd just get this
disappointed look on his face.

35:36.008 --> 35:39.428
I remember that look
when he was a boy.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.974
He had one of those
faces, didn't he?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.016
Like you could always see

35:45.017 --> 35:48.270
the little kid he used to be.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.563
Yeah.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.649
He got that from his dad.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.401
He told me about him.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.778
No, he would have,

35:56.779 --> 35:58.738
well, he would have told
you about his step dad,

35:58.739 --> 36:01.825
he'd never knew his
biological father.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.577
What was he like?

36:03.578 --> 36:05.997
I couldn't really tell you.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.208
He just vanished.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.922
Really he was still
just a boy, you know.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.800
It's difficult.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.804
It was, it was.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.222
Not uncommon.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.808
Sadly not at all.

36:28.978 --> 36:29.978
But,

36:31.522 --> 36:33.858
we weren't anything special.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.067
Augy was.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.823
Yeah, he was.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.247
I wonder if that's
what got him murdered.

36:52.084 --> 36:54.878
It would be difficult
to be his mother

36:54.879 --> 36:57.089
and to not think like that.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.133
Meaning what?

36:59.134 --> 37:01.968
If it was, murder,
it's the fault of that

37:01.969 --> 37:06.097
deviant someone out there
who committed the act.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.934
But if it was suicide,

37:09.936 --> 37:13.189
you have to shoulder
more of the blame.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.027
Yeah.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.739
I don't mean to be callous.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.991
I really don't.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.746
But Augy wasn't killed.

37:29.747 --> 37:33.584
I think he might have
allowed himself to fall.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.715
I don't understand, why?

37:41.425 --> 37:44.428
Because, Augy was
bright and sweet

37:46.180 --> 37:48.683
but he was also dirty and sad.

37:51.852 --> 37:54.272
More sad than he ever let on.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.277
Look Anna, I'm sorry.

38:02.655 --> 38:03.655
I'm angry.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.617
Yeah.

38:08.786 --> 38:09.786
Me too.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.390
Oh.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.228
- I wasn't...
- I wasn't being.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.814
I'm sorry I don't
know what came over me.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.482
That's not like me.

38:39.483 --> 38:43.654
Well I should have
been more understanding.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.323
You're a,

38:49.201 --> 38:50.201
I've just

38:50.995 --> 38:53.998
seen people I've
cared about vanish.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.818
Well I'll keep you out it

38:56.842 --> 38:59.169
from now on, I promise.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.130
That won't be necessary.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.716
Unless you need to.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.344
Thanks.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.224
Are those his ashes?

39:14.435 --> 39:16.437
Yes, how did you know?

39:17.855 --> 39:22.026
I've received that type
of package once or twice.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.194
Augy's friend Sean

39:24.195 --> 39:26.071
is gonna take me out on
his boat this weekend

39:26.072 --> 39:27.406
to deliver them,

39:28.282 --> 39:30.034
the ashes to the bay.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.038
Would you like to come with me?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.291
I would.

39:41.962 --> 39:42.962
Thanks.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.451
Augy, are you there?

41:07.840 --> 41:09.175
Can you hear me?

41:20.352 --> 41:21.854
Please talk to me.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.737
I can hear you.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.244
Are you alright?

41:39.163 --> 41:40.831
I'm good.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.835
Where are you, baby?

41:45.794 --> 41:48.130
I'm with friends.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.347
Will you forgive me?

41:59.934 --> 42:02.352
I love you.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.353
This,

42:04.230 --> 42:07.024
it doesn't mean
anything anymore.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.367
It does to me.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.083
Will you tell me how you died?

42:26.710 --> 42:29.630
Think
about how I lived.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.803
I'm so sorry.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.537
Hey.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.454
I know you're gonna wanna

43:02.455 --> 43:04.330
try to talk me out of this,

43:04.331 --> 43:06.583
but Juan said that
he was at work

43:06.584 --> 43:08.543
the night that Augy died

43:08.544 --> 43:11.588
and I need to know if he
was telling the truth.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.423
Come in.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.423
Thanks.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.387
It got really late and I just,

43:19.388 --> 43:21.056
I forgot to tip him.

43:24.351 --> 43:26.604
Thanks for checking for me.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.067
I do, the gentleman's
name is Juan.

43:34.361 --> 43:35.361
I see.

43:37.615 --> 43:38.615
He was.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.076
Okay.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.911
Yeah, thank you.

43:43.912 --> 43:44.912
Bye bye.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.962
Well, so much for that theory.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.557
I find that as the years pass,

44:04.558 --> 44:08.478
I have less and less patience
for these somber events.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.897
They remind you of
your own mortality.

44:10.898 --> 44:11.774
They remind me of other

44:11.775 --> 44:15.151
equally uninteresting
somber events.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.944
You're a complete asshole.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.265
You just lack the ware with all

44:18.289 --> 44:20.490
to appreciate my
level of artistry.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.408
This is real for her.

44:22.409 --> 44:25.119
You could stand to be
a little more kind.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.329
That's kind of presumptuous
of you, isn't it?

44:26.330 --> 44:28.331
Telling me how to
behave on my own boat.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.125
And how exactly did you buy it?

44:31.126 --> 44:33.252
And I suppose that you
just work like a mad man

44:33.253 --> 44:34.129
and saved up your nickels

44:34.130 --> 44:35.922
and that's how you
bought a block size

44:35.923 --> 44:37.715
apartment building, huh?

44:37.716 --> 44:40.886
No help at all from
daddy on that one.

44:46.850 --> 44:47.850
To August.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.772
We will all miss him.

44:53.607 --> 44:54.607
We will.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.486
Thank you, August.

44:58.570 --> 45:01.114
Thank you, yes thank you.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.534
Thank you for being gorgeous.

45:04.451 --> 45:05.660
For always saying yes

45:05.661 --> 45:07.912
to all the unseemly things
that I asked of you.

45:07.913 --> 45:10.623
Thank you for being such
a willing participant...

45:10.624 --> 45:11.916
That is enough.

45:11.917 --> 45:13.376
This is his mother.

45:13.377 --> 45:14.211
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.546
Am I violating the
sanctity of motherhood?

45:16.547 --> 45:17.381
Alright, gentlemen,

45:17.382 --> 45:20.384
for Christ sakes,
leave it be, okay?

45:26.181 --> 45:28.726
Maybe we should let him go now?

46:40.422 --> 46:42.632
I'm sorry for my part in that,

46:42.633 --> 46:46.594
he and I just seem to rub
each other the wrong way.

46:46.595 --> 46:49.473
Augy did love him
in some way so,

46:51.225 --> 46:55.394
I think there's gotta
be some good in him.

46:55.395 --> 46:56.814
I don't see it.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.402
Maybe,

47:03.403 --> 47:04.738
maybe he did it.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.075
Murdered Augy?

47:10.285 --> 47:13.956
Say he did, how could
you possibly prove it?

47:15.374 --> 47:16.667
I don't know.

47:24.132 --> 47:27.009
I've got a little errand to run.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.010
You okay?

47:28.847 --> 47:29.847
Yeah.

47:29.848 --> 47:34.017
Actually, I'd really rather
not be alone just now.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.241
Wow, you grew up here?

47:50.742 --> 47:51.869
Yeah, yeah.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.005
Now I just come by once a week

48:04.006 --> 48:06.008
to keep the place alive.

48:06.967 --> 48:09.135
Well if you don't
mind me asking,

48:09.136 --> 48:11.138
why haven't you sold it?

48:13.765 --> 48:16.809
It's still my legal residence.

48:16.810 --> 48:20.479
I got rid of most of
my parent's stuff.

48:20.480 --> 48:24.067
I keep meaning to put
it on the market but.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.575
This is sweet.

48:32.701 --> 48:33.941
There are no other photos here,

48:33.965 --> 48:35.801
is this one of a kind?

48:37.414 --> 48:41.376
Yeah, my old man wasn't
much for photography.

48:45.881 --> 48:47.506
Sometimes I wonder
what might have

48:47.507 --> 48:50.760
been going through his
mind when he took that.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.930
Maybe he was just happy.

48:54.097 --> 48:58.143
That would have been a
little out of character.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.669
I like what you've
done with the place.

49:25.379 --> 49:26.379
No!

49:29.299 --> 49:30.300
Great, so.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.221
Tell me where Augy is.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.223
He's dead.

49:38.225 --> 49:39.308
You'll forgive me,

49:39.309 --> 49:42.479
I have my doubts
about that statement.

49:43.814 --> 49:47.985
I threw his ashes in the
bay yesterday afternoon.

49:53.824 --> 49:54.992
And you are?

49:56.201 --> 49:57.285
His mother.

49:59.871 --> 50:00.871
Wow.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.002
What did you want with him?

50:06.003 --> 50:07.420
Nothing.

50:07.421 --> 50:10.297
I want his boyfriend, Sean.

50:10.298 --> 50:11.966
Why, what did he do?

50:11.967 --> 50:13.760
It's about money and.

50:15.178 --> 50:16.846
I don't like to
discuss my finances

50:16.847 --> 50:18.681
with new acquaintances.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.933
However, when you
scattered those ashes,

50:20.934 --> 50:22.519
were you on a boat?

50:24.146 --> 50:25.731
Where is it docked?

50:30.193 --> 50:34.031
I can appreciate your
situation, I really can.

50:34.990 --> 50:38.117
But it is always a
mistake to believe

50:38.118 --> 50:41.038
that you have
nothing left to lose.

50:48.211 --> 50:51.089
Marina Bay, Young
Harbor, dock F.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.054
Thank you for your help.

50:59.639 --> 51:00.848
One last detail,

51:00.849 --> 51:04.393
I can't have you phoning
Sean or the police,

51:04.394 --> 51:06.896
warning them,
anything like that.

51:06.897 --> 51:11.068
In the event that either of
those two things take place,

51:13.153 --> 51:15.738
we come back, we find you again

51:15.739 --> 51:18.909
and I pick up right
where we left off.

51:20.535 --> 51:21.870
That make sense?

51:22.746 --> 51:23.746
Okay?

51:38.011 --> 51:41.263
Must be moving packages for him.

51:41.264 --> 51:42.264
Packages?

51:43.058 --> 51:46.561
Trafficking drugs up
and down the coast.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.730
I found some in Augy's room.

51:49.731 --> 51:50.899
Not a lot but.

51:54.070 --> 51:55.070
I mean, do you think

51:55.071 --> 51:58.739
I should even bother
calling the police?

51:58.740 --> 52:01.700
Did you get a look
at what they were driving?

52:01.701 --> 52:02.701
No.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.707
Not a lot the police
can do about that.

52:11.419 --> 52:13.337
I called Sean.

52:13.338 --> 52:16.133
I know they told
me not to but I.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.303
What did he say?

52:24.933 --> 52:28.727
He said, "Thanks," and
then he hung up on me.

52:28.728 --> 52:29.728
Prick.

52:31.982 --> 52:36.110
Jonas, they said they're
gonna come back for me.

52:36.111 --> 52:38.988
You told them what you could.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.656
I doubt that they'd bother to

52:40.657 --> 52:43.326
come back just to prove a point.

52:45.579 --> 52:47.663
Why don't you stay
in my room tonight,

52:47.664 --> 52:49.456
just to be safe?

52:49.457 --> 52:51.960
I can crash here on the couch.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.421
Thank you.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.338
Maybe tomorrow

52:56.339 --> 52:58.716
we talk about moving
you some place else.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.886
My parent's place is open.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.263
That's very kind of you but,

53:04.264 --> 53:08.350
I have to stay here, I have
to be near, in his room.

53:08.351 --> 53:09.351
Alright.

53:11.271 --> 53:13.272
Then I'll at least get somebody

53:13.273 --> 53:15.816
to change the lock on the door.

53:15.817 --> 53:16.817
Okay.

53:30.875 --> 53:31.875
Lucky for you,

53:31.876 --> 53:34.711
I changed the
linens this morning.

53:36.504 --> 53:40.675
I'll be down at the front
desk if you need anything.

53:42.594 --> 53:43.845
Can you stay?

53:46.348 --> 53:47.891
I need you to stay.

53:51.478 --> 53:53.396
I probably shouldn't.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.733
Just to help me sleep.

54:00.528 --> 54:01.613
Yeah, okay.

54:41.361 --> 54:43.113
You just disappeared.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.074
I didn't wanna wake you up.

54:47.075 --> 54:48.075
Sorry.

54:49.619 --> 54:51.705
Can I show you something?

55:05.719 --> 55:07.971
There is hundreds of these.

55:09.514 --> 55:12.474
I just keep going over
them again and again.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.476
There's a lot of this kind.

55:14.477 --> 55:15.728
You know, I don't

55:15.729 --> 55:17.771
remember things being
like this at all

55:17.772 --> 55:19.606
when I was young.

55:19.607 --> 55:23.194
I don't know, I think
risque is relative.

55:28.825 --> 55:31.618
That's from the park
right up the street.

55:31.619 --> 55:32.454
Really?

55:32.455 --> 55:34.705
Could you take me to
where this was shot?

55:34.706 --> 55:36.832
It would just be
really nice to able to

55:36.833 --> 55:39.961
picture him in a,
in a happier place.

55:42.839 --> 55:44.673
Okay.

55:44.674 --> 55:45.674
Thanks.

56:11.993 --> 56:14.329
It really is beautiful here.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.581
The lake I mean.

56:18.041 --> 56:22.212
This is about where
that picture was taken.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.180
I hope he was happy
when he took it.

56:33.431 --> 56:34.933
Might have been.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.947
That's a rookie dealer.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.491
He'll get arrested
once or twice,

56:52.492 --> 56:56.078
that'll teach him
to be more subtle.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.956
How do you know he's not
just waiting for someone?

56:58.957 --> 57:00.749
I'm sure he is.

57:00.750 --> 57:02.251
A very special someone

57:02.252 --> 57:03.794
with an inch he can't scratch

57:03.795 --> 57:05.964
and a pocket full of cash.

57:07.132 --> 57:08.800
Someone like Augy?

57:09.759 --> 57:12.137
No no, Augy never had that,

57:13.805 --> 57:16.890
that look about him, you know.

57:16.891 --> 57:19.269
At least not that I ever saw.

57:21.771 --> 57:25.358
You know a little bit
about these things?

57:32.532 --> 57:35.285
I knew a person with a problem.

57:38.079 --> 57:41.082
She came here,
I came here with her.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.795
At first I was
trying to stop her,

57:46.629 --> 57:49.966
just to find her, to
know where she was.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.096
Were you in love with her?

57:58.975 --> 57:59.975
I was,

58:02.479 --> 58:03.938
compelled by her.

58:06.107 --> 58:08.984
I like to think that love
feels a little better

58:08.985 --> 58:10.403
than what we had.

58:14.115 --> 58:17.619
Anyway, it ended badly
as these things do.

58:19.454 --> 58:20.497
She took off.

58:23.374 --> 58:27.212
I found myself coming
to the park without her.

58:28.296 --> 58:31.174
Told myself I was
getting over her.

58:35.512 --> 58:39.682
Do you know what ever became
of her, what happened?

58:41.017 --> 58:42.185
I got clean,

58:43.269 --> 58:45.771
and when you get clean,

58:45.772 --> 58:48.608
you lose track of
a lot of people.

59:09.796 --> 59:14.716
Maybe I'll just leave you
alone with your thoughts.

59:14.717 --> 59:16.386
I don't want that.

59:21.349 --> 59:23.685
I don't wanna think anymore.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.376
I'm sorry,

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:32.920
it's not you.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.687
It's been a long stretch since I

01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:52.106
been with a woman

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.487
and not since I was using.

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:06.496
I'm not really sure I
know how without anymore.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.125
It's alright.

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:14.961
Is it?

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:18.049
Yeah.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:35.817
You know, he told me a
story once about Mac.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:41.363
I bet he had a lot
of stories about Mac.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.031
Mac really made
him sleep outside

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.200
for three nights
to toughen him up?

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.660
Out in the corner of the ranch,

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.954
about half a mile
from the house.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:52.541
Augy was afraid of
the dark, you know,

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.877
but he still went out there.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.546
He waited until they
were over the crest

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.173
before he started crying.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:02.009
But I still heard him.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.434
Why would you let him do that?

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.732
Well, you have to understand,

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:20.236
before Mac was a
part of our lives,

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.990
it was Augy and I all the time.

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.868
We were very very close.

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:29.662
He was my world.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.917
And I saw so much of
myself in him, that I just,

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.335
I worried, you know, how,

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:40.840
how is this kid gonna
grow up to be a man?

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:44.885
I can't teach him those things

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:46.888
and Mac did care for me,

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.599
he did love me in his own way.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.476
He was good to me.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.770
And to be fair, there
aren't a lot of guys

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.981
who would have taken us on.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.823
I need to ask you something.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.996
What do you think of
Sean as a suspect?

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:18.543
Anna, I really shouldn't have
said what I said that night.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:21.714
No no no, you were
absolutely right.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.132
I mean, look at the guy,

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:27.177
his involvement with drugs.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.304
Sean is often a pig,

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:32.140
but he's not a murderer,

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.892
and despite
everything, he and Augy

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.519
had something about to as close

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.561
to a normal relationship

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:39.648
as either of them ever had.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.233
Then why the breakup?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.151
Well that was all Augy.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.986
I think there was a
lot about Sean's life

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.906
that he couldn't fully accept.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:51.077
Maybe Sean just
couldn't let him go.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.998
Or maybe I said
something I didn't mean.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.629
And the truth is
that Augy's death is

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.009
exactly the terrible
accident it appears to be.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:10.929
I'm sorry.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:20.230
Maybe it's time to get some air.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:21.899
I'm parked out back.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.803
You lied to me about
Sean's whereabouts.

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.598
All of this is on you.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.061
You find Sean.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.566
You call this number

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.985
and you tell me where he is.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.278
Tell me where he is,

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:11.239
you have 24 hours,
do you understand?

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.701
24 hours and then I escalate.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:33.512
Read your statement.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.934
So I guess the first
question's kind of obvious,

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.728
why didn't you call
us after the break in?

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:43.021
You had two armed men

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.231
waiting for you in your room.

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:46.692
It's not my room.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.243
But I want every
detail you remember,

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:58.745
every single detail.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.413
From the break in

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:03.833
to the men who
committed these crimes.

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:08.005
Do you think they had something
to do with Augy's murder?

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:11.841
Do you?

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:26.607
She right about
me, that detective.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:30.319
What happened to
Eric is my fault.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.030
That's not true.

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:40.286
Okay.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.041
Are you gonna be okay
here for about an hour?

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:48.253
I just gotta go make a
key drop to a new tenant.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.546
Of course.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.339
Do you have any tea I can make?

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.384
Yeah, first cabinet,
all the staples.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.721
Whiskey too, if you need it.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:09.733
Jonas?

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:12.069
That was quick!

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.418
Listen, listen to
me, time is money.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.421
I need both, I've
got neither, okay?

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.423
No, she's not hurt.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.426
Don't, don't get macho
with me, old man, okay?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.303
You go to the cops,
you screw me over,

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.596
she's long gone before
anyone finds her, okay?

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.517
So on Friday at noon,
there's gonna be a car

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.352
outside your building,

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:29.104
you just put the
money in the back seat

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.816
in a briefcase,
nothing tacky and

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.611
and we're done here.

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:03.013
Did you kill my son?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.688
Goddammit, what
is wrong with you?

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:14.691
Oh, don't you know, mommy?

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.492
Probably the same as
that thing that was wrong

01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:18.361
with your poor
little murdered boy.

01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:19.196
Don't.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.238
Don't what?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.618
Let me tell you, it's
not that complicated,

01:09:25.618 --> 01:09:27.537
just to tip somebody
out a window.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:30.665
You bastard son of a bitch!

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:33.960
You're right on both counts.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:34.961
Why?

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:39.675
He kept nagging me.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:44.345
He liked the parties

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:47.765
and he liked the boat and
all the other trappings

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:49.267
but he just got these

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:51.395
these spasms of morality.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:56.274
Probably something
he got from you.

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:59.068
And he wouldn't party anymore.

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:00.320
Just started to sound like

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.448
some mouthy old hausfrau
who had no respect

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:06.075
for my chosen career path,

01:10:06.076 --> 01:10:09.330
and I got to sick to
death of it and I.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.966
Goddamn you, he was all I had.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.761
You never had Augy!

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.639
You traded your chance
to be a mother to him

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.766
a long time ago
for some easy life

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:31.936
with a puritanical cowboy.

01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:36.565
You didn't even know him.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.780
Oh god.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:45.448
Please.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.577
I didn't kill your son.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:54.624
I left that party and
I went to the bar.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:58.796
Lots of people saw me there,
you can ask the police.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.677
But the truth is
that Augy and I, we,

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.972
we adored each other,

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:14.395
and we disappointed
each other, horribly.

01:11:19.483 --> 01:11:22.486
The way we all do
with ones we love.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:27.658
Don't ya think?

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:42.339
Quiet.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.011
Slide your feet inside the bag.

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:53.058
Be a very good girl, Anna.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.351
Very good girl.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:56.978
Good girl, good girl,

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:57.979
good girl.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.337
Anna.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:28.302
Are you okay?

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.554
I think so.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.515
Oh thank god.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:37.686
Another couple minutes and
I was gonna swing by the ER.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.234
Thank you, Jonas.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.244
Here you go.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:56.789
Thank you.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:05.546
Well, I guess this

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.300
little drama is
about played out.

01:13:11.261 --> 01:13:12.888
Did you pay them?

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:18.601
Considered going to the police,

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:21.230
after the way they treated you,

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:25.692
it seems easier to go
to the bank instead.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.153
I give them the cash,

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:31.948
he gives into his supplier,

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:35.327
they all go away, you
get your life back.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:42.166
Jonas,

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:45.629
I'm so sorry.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.175
I've cost you a lot.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.177
I've always thought of it

01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:55.472
as my father's money anyway.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:00.643
To be honest,

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:04.981
not much else I've
found is worth anything.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.650
You're a good cause.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.333
He didn't kill him.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.673
Somebody did though.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.764
Could be that Augy killed Augy.

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.518
Maybe somebody else.

01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:46.355
Might be that you'll
figure it all out

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:49.401
and see that person
see away forever.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.822
What's that gonna get you?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.497
Justice.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:08.170
Not if you don't reach.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.908
You're saying it's gone.

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.202
It's been gone since that night,

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.079
I'm sure of it.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.373
You must have some
crime scene photography

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.083
that can corroborate.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:51.337
I'm sorry but there are
a lot of people here.

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:52.922
Yeah, so?

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.799
So, anyone of these people

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.217
could have taken the photograph.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.593
I'm sorry, this is nothing.

01:15:57.594 --> 01:15:58.886
No, I saw that photograph

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:01.430
in Louise Smith's apartment.

01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:03.474
Are you
certain it's the same one?

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:06.561
I'm positive, it's hard to miss.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.604
But she said she's
had it for a while.

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:11.190
No, she told me
she'd had it forever.

01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:13.734
Why would she lie about
something like that unless...

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.820
She's covering her tracks.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.489
She took a souvenir.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.616
What if they had
matching photographs,

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:22.743
what if each had one.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:25.538
What if someone at the
party broke the frame,

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.290
I'm sorry but this
doesn't prove anything.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.542
I can't ask for
warrants based on this.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.794
Yeah, that does sound
like a lot of work.

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:32.629
You know what, buddy,

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.190
you're not helping
with this situation.

01:16:34.191 --> 01:16:35.734
You should be
comforting this woman,

01:16:35.735 --> 01:16:38.426
not throwing fuel to the fire.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.346
What I need is for
you to do your job.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:49.562
Nothing.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.818
Listen.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:56.819
His,

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.572
personal affects are
ready to be picked up

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.325
in the evidence room.

01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:05.662
I can walk you over there.

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:29.727
Not gonna get any
further with her.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.730
I don't intend to try.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.858
Those are your options.

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:38.861
Look at this, Louise
left a voicemail,

01:17:38.862 --> 01:17:41.031
two days before Augy died.

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.243
Hey Augy, it's me.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.830
I just wanted to, I don't know.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.792
Last night was amazing.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.211
I feel like I've been
waiting a long time

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:58.005
for that, maybe my whole life.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.842
Anyway, we can't just
pretend like this isn't real.

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.845
We have to talk to Juan.

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:12.103
Well that's.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.104
A motive.

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.941
Sure sounds like one.

01:19:00.485 --> 01:19:02.571
Augy didn't forgive me.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.285
There is
nothing to forgive.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.454
The storage.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.710
Augy, I need more time.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:20.464
Time, doesn't run out.

01:19:22.799 --> 01:19:23.967
It's an ocean.

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:27.721
Your life is your
own little boat.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.140
Did she do it?

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:35.312
Did Louise push you?

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.482
I hit the ground

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:42.986
to make it from where
I was to where I am.

01:19:45.572 --> 01:19:47.741
Where did you go?

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.159
Here.

01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:52.703
Here, mom.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.968
Are you getting any answers?

01:20:11.598 --> 01:20:13.266
You were whispering.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:18.146
Sometimes I talk in my sleep.

01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:22.566
Augy?

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:27.947
Yeah.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.869
You weren't sleeping.

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:49.426
I've got to look
Louise in the face

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:52.889
and tell her that I
know what she's done.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.352
You expect a confession?

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.773
I don't need one.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.653
Well so what, you'll,

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.155
you'll just know,

01:21:10.073 --> 01:21:11.241
and then what?

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:15.245
Take things into your own hands?

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:19.958
What if you're wrong?

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:23.753
What if it was an accident?

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.841
What if he really did jump?

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:33.012
No.

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:35.055
I can't.

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:41.604
Jonas,

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.653
I just have to do something.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.485
Thanks for meeting me.

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:30.986
Of course,

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.322
what's going on?

01:22:34.157 --> 01:22:37.660
There are a few loose
ends still to tie up.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:39.286
I'm sure there are
a lot of emotions.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.788
I know you slept with Augy

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.958
a few days before he died.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.418
You don't, nobody...

01:22:46.419 --> 01:22:48.338
I have his cellphone.

01:22:50.173 --> 01:22:52.425
I heard your voice message.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.553
He was popular.

01:22:58.181 --> 01:22:59.765
And I know that
you took the photo

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:01.935
from his place that night.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.146
It was a gift.

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:11.193
Then why did you lie?

01:23:11.194 --> 01:23:14.071
Why did you tell me that
you'd had it forever?

01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:18.243
You must have misunderstood
something that I said.

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:20.203
No.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.704
You went back there that night

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:22.955
to confess your feelings

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:26.458
and to see if he shared
them, but he didn't.

01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:28.210
He didn't care for you

01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.795
any more than he cared about

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:31.798
any of the rest of them.

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:44.560
Well I think I'd better go.

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:47.563
I need to hear you say it.

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:51.109
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:53.736
We're not fucking finished.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.738
I think we are.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.259
In fact, I think
this is the last time

01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.619
we will ever see each other.

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:02.954
Anna,

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.246
Anna, stop, Anna.

01:24:04.247 --> 01:24:05.247
Anna, Anna!

01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:09.419
You still have a life.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.112
When Mac and I
first got together,

01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:39.324
Augy was just little still.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:45.121
Mac started doing this thing,

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:49.084
saying these little things just,

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:55.047
you know, tuck in your
shirt, straighten your back,

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:56.799
speak up, boy.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.760
It was just little, you know,

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.303
at the time it seemed like

01:25:01.304 --> 01:25:04.140
he was just trying
to be a dad and

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:08.602
trying to show Augy
how to be a man and

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.437
I thought that was
something he needed,

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.941
you know, I was alone with him

01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:16.110
and Augy was such a,

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.571
a tender boy, a sensitive boy.

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:23.409
I remember looking
out the window

01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:30.166
and watching him march
Augy around this field

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:33.503
like a soldier for hours.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:39.007
Just saying, you know.

01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:40.760
Buck like a man, boy.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.847
Buck like a man,
straiten your back.

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.474
Just yelling at him.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.980
And I didn't stop him.

01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:57.068
I didn't do anything.

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:04.492
Mac never hit him,
I mean he never,

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:07.287
he never was physical

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:12.542
with him or with me and
you know, I think that,

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:16.796
had he been,

01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:19.715
it would have been
enough of a push

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:22.177
for me to get us out of there,

01:26:23.636 --> 01:26:24.721
to leave him.

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.017
But I didn't.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:37.775
I just let him

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.823
push my boy away from me.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.343
Had I stopped him,

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:10.808
I know my boy will be alive,

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:14.479
Augy would still be here.

01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:20.193
You don't know that.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:23.237
No, I do.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:30.870
I do know it.

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:36.084
And I'll never be free of it.

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:46.844
Can we go now?

01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:41.249
What?

01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:47.422
I was

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.469
just wondering if you're

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.806
planning on sticking around?

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:59.060
I'm thinking about it.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:02.312
I mean,

01:30:04.273 --> 01:30:06.317
this was Augy's home, so.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:11.781
It's mine, too.

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.121
What do you want?

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.290
This.

01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:27.922
Nothing else?

01:30:40.476 --> 01:30:41.561
I'm here now.
