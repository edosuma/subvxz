00:56.057 --> 00:58.977
<i>Here's a little story I'd like to tell...</i>

00:59.144 --> 01:02.981
<i>about three best friends
and their first Noel.</i>

01:03.815 --> 01:07.902
<i>It begins right before Christmas 2001...</i>

01:08.069 --> 01:11.322
<i>when a young man named Ethan
became an orphan.</i>

01:11.823 --> 01:14.743
<i>His mama and papa
both tragically gone...</i>

01:14.909 --> 01:19.748
<i>it seemed for him
Christmas had sung its swan song.</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:22.292
<i>As he sat alone on Christmas Eve...</i>

01:22.459 --> 01:25.003
<i>his friends came over
and forced him to leave.</i>

01:25.170 --> 01:27.464
<i>They had to get Ethan out of his funk...</i>

01:27.881 --> 01:31.009
<i>so they went to a bar
and they got his ass drunk.</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:35.805
<i>With tears and with sadness
they started to mend. Then they said:</i>

01:35.972 --> 01:38.725
No more crying.
This sad shit must end.

01:38.892 --> 01:42.312
Christmas was about family,
but now it's about friends.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.856
<i>Thus began a new tradition.</i>

01:45.023 --> 01:47.609
<i>The friends hung on Christmas
and fun was their mission.</i>

01:47.776 --> 01:50.153
Who's the baddest motherfucker
on Christmas day?

01:50.361 --> 01:52.530
- Get in there.
- Aww!

01:53.281 --> 01:54.282
You knew.

01:54.657 --> 01:55.950
- Boom!
- What is it?

01:56.117 --> 01:58.870
That shit holds a hundred songs
at one time.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.371
I got the new Dave Matthews
downloaded.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.081
- Oh, yeah. Ricky Martin.
- Oh!

02:02.248 --> 02:03.875
That guy slays ass.

02:04.209 --> 02:07.879
<i>They chilled
with each other, did all sorts of stuff.</i>

02:08.045 --> 02:10.340
<i>They drank many drinks,
they fucked shit up.</i>

02:10.507 --> 02:11.549
Light his dick.

02:15.345 --> 02:16.721
Unh!

02:18.097 --> 02:20.517
<i>Then one fateful night, 2008...</i>

02:20.683 --> 02:23.770
<i>they realized that Christmas
can be even more great.</i>

02:23.937 --> 02:26.648
<i>That eve at the bar,
they saw quite a sight.</i>

02:26.815 --> 02:29.818
<i>Fellow seekers ofjoy
having one crazy night.</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:32.570
<i>And there was a woman,
so pretty to all.</i>

02:32.737 --> 02:35.365
<i>They worked up the courage,
proceeded to call.</i>

02:35.532 --> 02:38.743
- Excuse me.
<i>- Ethan said. And she turned with a fright.</i>

02:38.910 --> 02:41.329
Where were you guys partying
earlier tonight?

02:41.496 --> 02:44.165
At a place so great
words cannot describe...

02:44.332 --> 02:46.417
with so many drinks
for one to imbibe.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.128
With so many drugs,
I can't believe I survived.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.588
What the fuck...

02:50.755 --> 02:51.923
<i>Ethan asked.</i>

02:52.090 --> 02:53.842
Is this party called?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.468
Why, you haven't heard?

02:55.635 --> 02:57.804
It's the Nutcracker Ball.

02:58.805 --> 03:01.391
<i>They asked all around, but to no avail.</i>

03:01.558 --> 03:05.144
<i>Where was this great party,
this whitest of whales?</i>

03:05.311 --> 03:08.064
<i>And though year upon year
they tried and they failed...</i>

03:08.231 --> 03:11.693
<i>they never did tire,
they never did bail.</i>

03:11.860 --> 03:14.195
<i>But over time, the fun did wane.</i>

03:14.362 --> 03:17.907
<i>One friend had a family,
the other had fame.</i>

03:18.074 --> 03:21.077
<i>As the years passed,
his boys, they grew up.</i>

03:21.244 --> 03:25.039
<i>But it seems our boy Ethan
is just a little bit stuck.</i>

03:29.335 --> 03:31.963
What's up, buddy? No?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.048
All right. You guys want any of this?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.800
- No, thank you.
- Cool.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.927
Keep it moving. There you go.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.512
Yes, good.

03:39.679 --> 03:41.514
Wait. No, no, no. What are you doing?

03:41.681 --> 03:43.850
No one was eating this tuna,
so I thought...

03:44.017 --> 03:46.577
No, no, no. You don't get to
make those executive decisions, elf.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.021
How old are you?

03:48.688 --> 03:50.732
- Thirty-three.
- Thirty-three. Heh, heh.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.692
Thirty-three years old, and you're an elf.

03:52.859 --> 03:54.986
And you don't even know
how to be an elf.

03:55.153 --> 03:56.279
Show me the elf face.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.156
Uh...

03:58.364 --> 04:00.783
It's happy. It's eager.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.285
More whimsical.

04:02.452 --> 04:04.579
Whimsy. Determined, though.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.540
- There you go! That's it!
- That was it.

04:07.707 --> 04:09.459
That's why you're coming back here
with a full tray.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.712
I'm gonna move you to coat check.
This is your last chance.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.924
And the whole time,
I wanna see that elf face.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.675
- Okay.
- Starting now.

04:18.718 --> 04:19.969
Go.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.137
Go.

04:24.307 --> 04:27.518
These two are together.
No, gotta take the ticket.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.104
Hi. Just you, sir?

04:30.271 --> 04:32.690
Great. This is your ticket.
Please try not to lose it.

04:32.857 --> 04:35.234
This is a very expensive coat,
so take care of it.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.945
Absolutely, sir.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.447
Here, ticket. Okay, this one.

04:39.614 --> 04:40.990
Yeah.

04:41.157 --> 04:43.034
Yeah. Great.

04:43.201 --> 04:44.953

Good to see you, baby.
Merry Christmas.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.799
You wanna take a picture, man?
Let's do it.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.968

06:26.220 --> 06:29.140
If you're not Christian, what are you?

06:29.307 --> 06:30.641
I'm Jewish.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.060
Is that why you look different?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.561
What was that? Come again.

06:33.728 --> 06:36.022
You just look funny.

- Isaac?
- Yo!

06:42.361 --> 06:43.401
What are you telling them?

06:43.529 --> 06:45.249
I'm just talking
to your lovely daughters...

06:45.406 --> 06:47.700
as though they are adults.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.994
From a cognitive level,
if you speak to kids like they're adults...

06:50.161 --> 06:53.081
it will make them more curious,
it will open up their minds to more things.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.666
- He's gonna be a great father.
- Yeah.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.878
I just hope we have kids
as beautiful as you girls.

06:59.087 --> 07:00.922
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.381
Sweeties, just come help Mommy
in the kitchen.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.383
- Are you okay? You want a hug?
- That's okay.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.843
Okay.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.930
- Gosh, I am such a fucking piece of shit.
- No, you're not at all.

07:09.097 --> 07:10.697
I'm the worst mom.
I'm gonna be terrible.

07:10.765 --> 07:11.974
No. Don't say that.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.518
What if I screw this up?

07:13.684 --> 07:16.395
You won't. Studies show your maternal
instincts really kick in in the last month.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.730
I know. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.

07:17.897 --> 07:20.483
- It's fine. I love you so much. Okay?
- I love you too.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.986
Bets, look who it is.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.363
Ethan!

07:25.530 --> 07:26.656
Merry Christmas.

07:26.823 --> 07:28.574
Oh, my God! You look so big!

07:28.741 --> 07:30.118
- No.
- No?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.124
You don't know
a lot of pregnant women, do you?

07:32.286 --> 07:34.205
- I meant the baby.
- No, I look really big.

07:34.372 --> 07:36.415
You look great,
and the baby's probably cramped...

07:36.582 --> 07:38.417
- inside of your small, fit body.
- Thank you. No, that's enough.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.003
- Just shut up. It's all good. It's fine.
- I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.171
She looks beautiful.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.756
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

07:43.923 --> 07:46.425
- Do you want a drink, honey?
- I'm okay right now.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.677
Really?

07:47.844 --> 07:50.847
Yeah. I'm kind of on call.
Gotta keep my head on straight.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.348
- But you're gonna drink tonight?
- Yeah. For sure.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.475
- Because I'm already kind of drunk.
- I can tell.

07:55.935 --> 07:56.978
- That's Chris.
- Yeah.

07:57.687 --> 07:58.980
Everybody, look who it is!

07:59.147 --> 08:03.109
Merry Christmas, blessed Kwanzaa,
happy Hanukkah!

08:03.276 --> 08:05.570
Hey, man. How's it going?

08:05.778 --> 08:08.739
Whoa! Look at this! Oh, my God!

08:08.906 --> 08:11.200
I couldn't even tell you were pregnant
till I saw you from the side.

08:11.367 --> 08:12.702
Look how tiny you are!

08:12.869 --> 08:14.453
That's so nice of you to say.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.220
That is how you talk
to a pregnant woman.

08:17.081 --> 08:20.042
It's amazing. You've had the season
of a lifetime. Congratulations, man.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.711
- Congrats.
- Thanks, man.

08:21.878 --> 08:25.506
Got a new workout, new diet,
new paleo thing I've been doing.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.758
I've heard about that. And it works?

08:27.925 --> 08:29.844
It rips you up. If you see me naked,
it'll blow your mind.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.012

I was done a few years ago,
to be totally honest.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.820
We're like those kids
who won't stop trick-or-treating.

08:47.987 --> 08:49.906
Eventually, they come to your door,
you're like, "Eh."

08:50.072 --> 08:51.365

- No.

we're enabling him at this point.

09:01.459 --> 09:03.836
We're not helping him
get over his own problems.

09:04.003 --> 09:06.005
On a psychological level,
that's not good.

09:06.172 --> 09:07.252
I've made a decision.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.675
For a Christmas present tonight,
I'm gonna take him under my wing.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.682
I'm gonna help him
and get him out of this rut.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.346
It's a conversation we've been avoiding
for 10 years, actually.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.513
I know.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.182
Just do it easy.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.683

09:32.114 --> 09:34.283
Hey, Bets, tell Diana I said hello.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.576
Yeah, no.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.662
- No, no. Merry Christmas.
- Mwah.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.163
Bye-bye.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.040
- Congratulations.
- Mwah. Good to see you.

09:41.207 --> 09:43.417
- Luckiest guy in the Park.
- I sure am. Bye.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.627
Can I talk to you for a second
real quick?

09:44.794 --> 09:46.629
What? We're not doing gifts now,
are we?

09:46.796 --> 09:50.716
No, we're doing them tomorrow, but
this one I'm pretty sure you'll want tonight.

09:50.967 --> 09:53.552
- What is it?
- You have been such a rock...

09:53.719 --> 09:55.680
throughout this whole pregnancy.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.348
You're like my Dwayne Johnson.

09:57.515 --> 09:58.516
Thank you.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.810
It's Christmas now,
and we've almost made it...

10:00.977 --> 10:03.104
and you deserve this.
So Merry Christmas.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.355
Is it cologne?

10:04.522 --> 10:05.940
No.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.779
Holy shit!

10:11.946 --> 10:14.073
It's every single drug in the whole world.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.367
Why are you giving this to me?

10:16.534 --> 10:18.369
You've been so focused
on me and the baby...

10:18.536 --> 10:20.776
and tonight I think
you should just focus on yourself.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.708
Go out there,
get fucking wild, you know?

10:23.874 --> 10:26.877
Is this cocaine? I haven't done cocaine
for 11 years, I don't think.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.254
No one has, I don't think.

10:28.421 --> 10:30.131
That's amazing.
Where did you get all this shit?

10:30.298 --> 10:31.978
- Craigslist.
- You got it from Craigslist?

10:32.091 --> 10:34.010
I just typed in the search "NYC drugs."

10:34.176 --> 10:35.636
Really resourceful of you.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.431
It's your last Christmas together,
so have fun. Enjoy it.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.683
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah. I love you.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.810
This is so great.
I'll have my phone with me.

10:42.977 --> 10:46.105
I'll be home pretty early, I think.
Okay. I love you.

10:48.733 --> 10:49.859
What?

10:50.484 --> 10:51.944
What the fuck is this?

10:52.111 --> 10:53.911
This is the Red Bull Limousine, fellas.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.700
You are now looking at the face
and body of Red Bull.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.707
- Wow! Congratulations, man!
- Huh? Right?

11:00.119 --> 11:03.039
Since this is our final Christmas,
I figured we could do it in class.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.416
Seriously, this is what the spirit
of Christmas is all about.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.423
A rich athlete finally getting
the corporate limo that he always wanted.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.171
- Exactly!
- I think so.

11:10.338 --> 11:12.138
Let's go, get in.
You gotta see this. Come on.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.674
Cool!

11:14.425 --> 11:16.761
Yo, it's the Red Bull Limo, guys!

11:17.678 --> 11:18.679
All right.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.223
Yo! What's up, everybody?
This your man, C-Rob.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.767
We in the Red Bull Limo.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.520
And we Dom P'in it, we have Cristal in it,
Hennythuggin' it...

11:26.687 --> 11:28.647
and we got Red Bull!

11:28.814 --> 11:32.818
I'm capturing this
on my Sony Xperia Ultra phone.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.225
No matter what the light,
the picture's right. All right?

11:35.279 --> 11:36.989
This your man, Chris Rob,
coming at you.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.657
What happening? Peace!

11:38.824 --> 11:40.659
- Peace!
- Wow.

11:41.285 --> 11:42.620
And Internet.

11:42.787 --> 11:45.289
- His social media game is crazy.
- On point.

11:45.456 --> 11:46.540
- Really on point, yeah.
- On point.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.876
Five million people
probably just saw that.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.419
Hey there.

11:50.586 --> 11:54.048
Didn't wanna interrupt
while you guys were rolling back there.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.633
Great video, by the way.
I just watched it.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.842
That was fast.

11:57.009 --> 12:00.679
My name's Joshua. I'm gonna be your
Red Bull-provided driver for the evening.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.056
First stop: Rockefeller Center, right?

12:02.223 --> 12:03.943
- Great, thank you, Josh.
- Raise partition.

12:04.058 --> 12:05.059
Nice meeting you, Josh.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.353
I'm doing the hang-loose thing
too much.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll call you. There we go.

12:09.814 --> 12:11.190
Check out what Betsy gave me.

12:11.357 --> 12:13.484
It's a bunch of drugs.
We eat a little 'shrooms...

12:13.984 --> 12:17.196
to kind of trip out a little bit,
look at the lights, all the sparkly lights.

12:17.363 --> 12:18.364
Let's start with the champagne.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.658
Yeah, sure, yeah. Yeah!

12:22.284 --> 12:25.121
Aim it out the window,
aim it out the window! Oh!

12:25.704 --> 12:28.332
<i>♪ You know you wanna get down ♪</i>

12:30.793 --> 12:32.920
<i>♪ Get on down ♪♪</i>

12:33.671 --> 12:35.756
- So, what's up, E? How's life, man?
- Life is good!

12:35.923 --> 12:36.924
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

12:37.091 --> 12:39.427
How's the music going?
Any gigs coming up?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.679
Not gigs, but gigs are overrated, dude.

12:41.846 --> 12:43.472
People are just on their phones
the whole time.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.640
- You know what I mean?
- Totally, yeah.

12:44.807 --> 12:45.808
The thing I'm working on now...

12:45.975 --> 12:48.144
you really have to listen to it
start to finish. It's a concept album.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.478
What's the concept?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.981
I'm still conceptualizing
that part of it...

12:52.148 --> 12:53.190
- but it's all about who you know...
- C-Rob, will you sign this?

12:53.357 --> 12:54.358
- More than anything.
- Wait up, wait up.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.693
How's it going? Hey, merry Christmas.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.653
- Photobomb!
- There you go. All right.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.029
That just happens now?

12:59.196 --> 13:00.698
- People love C-Rob.
- Wow.

13:00.865 --> 13:02.950
So how about Diana?
You talk to her?

13:03.117 --> 13:04.277
How's things going with that?

13:04.410 --> 13:05.494
Hate to see that one get away,
you know?

13:05.661 --> 13:07.246
- It's still over.
- It's over. Don't worry about it.

13:07.413 --> 13:10.708
But it's okay. It's no one's fault, really.
We just drifted apart.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.127
Look, we're at the tree!
Why don't we talk about it another time?

13:13.294 --> 13:15.171
- What?
- Not now, man.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.051
Wow.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.887
Gentlemen...

13:23.429 --> 13:27.475
14 years ago to this very night,
a tradition was born.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.270
That year some drunk, fucking asshole
hit my parents with a car.

13:31.437 --> 13:34.356
So that Christmas,
I didn't have any family to be with...

13:34.523 --> 13:36.400
but you guys were there for me.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.110
But tonight!

13:38.277 --> 13:39.403
Tonight's different.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.531
We have mutually decided
to end this tradition.

13:42.698 --> 13:43.991
Isaac's about to have a baby.

13:44.158 --> 13:47.578
And Chris is just too fucking famous
to hang out with us anymore.

13:47.745 --> 13:49.497
But, guys, earlier today...

13:49.663 --> 13:53.501
I witnessed
a real-life Christmas miracle.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.920
- Where the fuck did you get those?
- Holy shit! Are those real?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.296
They are fucking real!

13:57.463 --> 13:58.464
Where did they come from?

13:58.631 --> 14:00.216
It doesn't matter!
It's a fucking Christmas miracle!

14:00.382 --> 14:02.134
You killed somebody for those?

14:02.301 --> 14:03.677
No, I stole them.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.554
That's awesome! What a blowout!

14:05.721 --> 14:08.682
It is the Nutcracker Ball!

14:08.849 --> 14:10.100
Yes!

14:10.267 --> 14:12.645
So I called the number on these tickets.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.105
They don't give out the address till 10.

14:15.272 --> 14:19.318
So that gives us several hours to hit
as many Christmas traditions as possible!

14:19.485 --> 14:20.486
Let's do it.

14:20.653 --> 14:22.773
And it's gonna be the
best fucking night of our lives!

14:22.821 --> 14:24.406
I'm so psyched, man. Awesome.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.742
Maybe it'll be
the new Christmas tradition.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.373
I don't know if we're really
replacing this with another tradition.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.458
That was a joke, Isaac.
Give me some credit.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.919
Obviously, that was a joke.
I am totally cool with it.

14:37.086 --> 14:38.379
Obviously, he's joking.

14:38.546 --> 14:41.173
- Definitely.
- Gentlemen, I got the sweaters.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.341
This one's for you.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.884
- This is for you.
- Nice.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.052
Let's do this!

14:45.219 --> 14:47.099
- Let's do it. Hey, where'd he go?

16:27.905 --> 16:30.824
Now it's Christmas. It's not
Christmas till we eat egg drop soup.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.118
It brings me back.
Who are you calling right now?

16:33.285 --> 16:35.329
- Calling my man Tommy Owens.
- You're calling Tommy Owens?

16:35.496 --> 16:37.122
- Who's Tommy Owens?
- He's the best player in the league.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.583
- Tommy!
- C-Money, what's up, my man?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.460
Merry Christmas. Heh-heh-heh.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.253
Tell him hi.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.755
Hennessy.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.465
We going to the Nutcracker Ball.
I got tickets for my boys.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.217
I got us on the list for the party...

16:48.384 --> 16:50.135
the after-party, the before-party,
every party.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.887
Congrats, baby, you coming up big time.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.014
What we do, baby. That's what we do!

16:54.181 --> 16:55.307
Tell him to bring some green with him.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.726
Oh. Hey, yo, C-Money,
while I got you on the phone...

16:57.893 --> 17:00.187
I hate to even ask, but you think
maybe you could bring us some weed?

17:00.354 --> 17:02.773
Yeah, I can get weed.
Look who you're talking to, baby.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.442
- Come on. It's Chris Money.
- Smoke it up!

17:05.608 --> 17:07.778
I'll see you at the Nutcracker Ball.
I'll bring you a half a pound...

17:07.944 --> 17:09.029
and we gonna roll. Much love.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.989
One. Chris love out. Peace.

17:13.117 --> 17:14.535
How much weed you got in that box?

17:14.702 --> 17:16.036
I don't know. Why don't we check?

17:16.203 --> 17:17.371
Check it out, playa.

17:17.538 --> 17:22.417
Someone call Snoop D-O-double
gezzank, because I got the reefers.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.961
You have one joint?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.880
She doesn't know that much about drugs.
The proportions of this shit is all off.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.632
Dude, we need to get some weed.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.634
Can we just not get derailed here?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.803
This is not about
some famous athlete and his weed.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.180
This is about the three of us.
This is our last Christmas together.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.987
It is about a famous athlete
and his weed.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.935
I've been on this dude's team for six
years and he finally knows who I am.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.262
If I can deliver this weed...

17:41.395 --> 17:44.148
we could smoke with Tommy Owens
and hang with him all night!

17:44.314 --> 17:45.524
I'd love to smoke weed
with Tommy Owens.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.291
See? He wants to
smoke with Tommy, right?

17:47.401 --> 17:48.652
Okay. Okay.

17:48.819 --> 17:51.196
- Where do we get some weed from?
- Uh...

17:51.363 --> 17:53.490
We could call Mr. Green.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.743
Why are we outside
our high school again?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.429
Because he's a fucking
drug-dealer and he's suspicious...

17:58.454 --> 18:01.039
and he doesn't meet you
unless he's met you there before.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.375
So it's either our old high school
or this guy's mom's house.

18:03.542 --> 18:04.543
That's not happening.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.128
I know. So it's here.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.173
Shit. Is that you?

18:09.339 --> 18:11.049
It's not mine.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.051
- No.
- Oh, shit.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.054
That was there before.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.723
Do they even
make payphones anymore?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.141
Don't touch it.
People wipe their butts on those.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.684
This is how you gotta talk to him.

18:20.851 --> 18:21.894
Don't pick up! Oh!

18:22.060 --> 18:23.437
Hello! 1998 speaking.

18:23.604 --> 18:24.813
That's gross.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.815
Oh.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.610
Yeah, I see you. Okay. Thanks.
He's right there.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.488
Go ahead. Go get the weed.

18:32.821 --> 18:33.941
I'm not going. You're going.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.450
- Just get it. Come on, don't be a baby.
- It's your weed!

18:36.617 --> 18:37.993
Shit.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.999
Is it just me?
He's changed a little bit, right?

18:44.208 --> 18:47.628
Uh, yeah, he seems like
he's excited about his fame.

18:47.795 --> 18:50.172
I think it's our job to sort of
just keep him in check.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.300
Sometimes, you think it's easy
to tell your friend something...

18:53.467 --> 18:55.636
and it's actually hard
to tell them that thing...

18:55.803 --> 18:57.054
once you're confronted
with the actual moment...

18:57.221 --> 18:58.388
that you would maybe tell them
that thing.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.556
You know what I mean?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.940
Mr. Green! What's up, man?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.733
Good evening.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.527
How you doing?
It's good to see you.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.153
I'm glad you open on Christmas.
Whoo.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.864
A lot of people need me
on Christmas, you know.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.617
It's a tough holiday.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.160
I know you.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.537
Yeah.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.872
You used to sell weed to me and
my friends when we were in high school.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.165
Yeah, that's crazy.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.501
So, what do you want?

19:27.668 --> 19:30.712
Your best shit, man.
That chronic, that drow, that...

19:30.879 --> 19:32.548
Yeah, yeah! Some of that.

19:32.714 --> 19:36.009
It's good to see you kids
still hanging out and smoking up.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.469
Makes me proud.

19:37.636 --> 19:40.848
Thanks, man. We're just kind of trying
to keep the dream alive, you know?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.016
But this is not for us.
This is for a good friend of mine.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.144
Tommy Owens. Quarterback.
The Messiah.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.647
You know what?
As far as I'm concerned...

19:48.814 --> 19:50.148
there's only one Messiah.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.235
Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.821
So that name's a little blasphemous.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.531
Yeah.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.541
The Weed of Christmas Present.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.628
I'm an athlete, so drug-free body.
Drug-free zone. No smoking.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.339
You buying that for somebody
and you're not gonna test it?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.842
That could be oregano.

20:17.593 --> 20:19.720
- Orega-what?
- Oregano.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.109
So...

20:35.652 --> 20:37.362
Something special
supposed to happen?

20:37.529 --> 20:39.031
It just did.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.325
You're in the present.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.748
What? Maybe I'm high
or something, man, I don't...

20:47.915 --> 20:50.000
Or maybe you're in the present.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.671
The Weed of Christmas Present.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.799
Well, with that logic, isn't all weed
the weed of Christmas present?

20:58.508 --> 21:00.636
Only on Christmas, kid.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.514
Anyway, that'll be a hundred bucks.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.060
Oh. All right. I'll get your hundreds.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.063
If you guys ain't doing nothing later,
you should stop by this party I'm throwing.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.190
It's a hell of a bash.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.275
Heh-heh. You serious?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.194
It's not in my car.

21:17.569 --> 21:18.904
It's a real party.

21:19.613 --> 21:23.408
Uh, we already got invited to something.
Sorry. But thank you for the invite.

21:23.575 --> 21:26.828
That's no problem.
My feelings aren't hurt. Not really.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.501
Tell Isaac,
"I'll see you in a couple hours."

21:32.668 --> 21:33.835
What?

21:34.002 --> 21:37.673
Tell Isaac I'll see him in a couple hours.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.300
How did he get so good
all of a sudden?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.885
I don't know.

21:42.052 --> 21:44.346
Oh. Here we go. Here we go.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.601
That shit was the weirdest
fucking experience of my life, dude.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.561
- Really?
- But I got the weed.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.938
Nice.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.773
Come on, let's go
tear this fucking karaoke down.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.150
Let them bitches know
the Ice Crew in the building!

21:57.317 --> 21:58.819
Let's do it, baby.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.988
- Did you practice the moves?
- Oh, I've been practicing.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.614
Hey!

22:05.492 --> 22:08.036
Whoa. Happy feet, happy feet.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.111
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.113
Ethan, it's Diana!

23:25.280 --> 23:26.698
- Hi.
- What's up?

23:26.865 --> 23:29.326
Chris, I wanna say hi to you,
but you're surrounded by fans!

23:29.493 --> 23:31.495
I know. It's crazy! Say hey to Ethan!

23:31.661 --> 23:32.746
He looks really great!

23:32.913 --> 23:35.624
Let's go outside and Instagram.
My social media game is on point!

23:35.791 --> 23:37.667
- That guy's really famous now.
- Yeah.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.919
Super famous.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.879
- So good seeing you guys!
- Hey!

23:41.338 --> 23:43.173
Merry Christmas.
What are you guys doing here?

23:43.340 --> 23:45.967
It's the only karaoke place
that's open on Christmas.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.803
Yeah, it's our tradition.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.638
I should've remembered
that you guys come here.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.056
But Run-DMC,
I got to see it! Finally.

23:51.223 --> 23:52.766
- You liked it?
- It was awesome.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.309
This is what you guys missed.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.644
She did Miley Cyrus.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.729
She destroyed <i>Wrecking Ball.</i>
It was amazing.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.773
- You still like that song.
- Everybody does.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.235
You can cry to it. You can run to it.
You can party to it.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.154
- Timeless!
- What are you guys doing?

24:06.321 --> 24:08.365
We're having
a really fun night, actually.

24:08.532 --> 24:10.492
We're kind of going not too hard,
but pretty hard.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.743
We're kind of just...

24:11.910 --> 24:13.161
It's our last night
doing the Christmas!

24:13.328 --> 24:16.790
- End of an era.
- Last year. Last year.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.042
But it's been really fun, though.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.961
Of course.
Betsy's giving birth in a month.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.921
She's having a baby, yeah.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.506
We're gonna miss her at the office.

24:24.673 --> 24:25.924
But she said that you've been
doing a very good job.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.634
That you're so prepared.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.804
You've read every single book
on being a dad since books were created.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.848
I would be losing my shit right now.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.183
That you're prepared,
like over-prepared.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.643
He's solid. He's got the stats.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.104
A lot of men in your position
fucking freak out.

24:39.271 --> 24:40.897
- They just leave.
- And they take off.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.025
- It's an epidemic.
- It's true. Are you guys...

24:44.192 --> 24:46.778
What the fuck! Are you guys okay?
Are you okay?

24:46.945 --> 24:50.073
The lights in here
fucking with you guys? Like a lot.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.283
Not really.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.577
I think moving around, maybe,
from the dancing.

24:53.743 --> 24:56.163
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call Betsy. I'll be right back.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.332
It's good to see you.
I'll be... I'll be... I'll be...

24:59.499 --> 25:00.625
Give her a call.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.670
You guys have a nice connection.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.256
Yeah, he's a sweetheart.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.536
- I'm gonna go to the bar, get more to drink.
- No. No, no.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.304
- Nice to see you.
- Merry Christmas.

25:12.470 --> 25:13.555
You look good.

25:15.765 --> 25:16.975
Hi.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.518
Hi. Heh, heh.

25:24.274 --> 25:25.442
Okay.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.985
Come on. Whoo!

25:27.152 --> 25:29.196
The 'shrooms are turning.
You got a big night ahead of you.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.655
Let's get something else going here.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.782
Cocaine. That'll straighten me out.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.577
Get in my brain.
Make me feel different.

25:35.785 --> 25:36.786
Yeah.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.377
What's up, Messiah?
How you doing, White Jesus? Ha, ha, ha.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.421
Yo, check it out. It's C-Rob, man.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.633
So everything's good. I got you.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.719
I got the shit. I got the weed.
I got the smoke.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.348
You know what? I'm tripping.
I'm gonna just text you, all right?

25:56.514 --> 25:59.184
What happened to peace?
Peace. C-Rob out.

25:59.351 --> 26:02.145
Chris motherfucking Roberts.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.814
- Well, I'm not Julia Roberts.
- Ha-ha-ha.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.775
- But you are a pretty woman.
- Ha-ha-ha.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.652
Oh, shit! Boom.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.695
Dude, I am such a fan.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.155
Meeting you here tonight...

26:12.322 --> 26:14.950
this is enough to make Christmas
tolerable for me.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.035
Whoa. You don't like Christmas?

26:17.202 --> 26:19.663
No. I fucking hate Christmas.

26:19.829 --> 26:22.749
Sorry to be like a Grinch. You're into it.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.960
This is amazing.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.462
As much as I hate Christmas,
that's how much I love you.

26:27.629 --> 26:31.258
- Wow.
- Sorry. Heh. I'm being too much.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.705
I'm jizzing all over you.
I'm getting, like, jizzy. Sorry.

26:33.802 --> 26:36.304
No, no, no. Jizz all over me.
I like that shit.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.807
You probably wanna
go back to your friends.

26:38.974 --> 26:40.475
Fuck my friends.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.560
Friends come and go...

26:42.727 --> 26:44.437
but fans, that's forever.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.773
- You're naughty.
- I'm very naughty.

26:46.940 --> 26:50.402
I'm gonna teach you a Christmas lesson,
you naughty boy.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.028
Okay.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.782
The truth will set you free.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.786
Hey, yo.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.956
This is a message for future Isaac...

27:03.123 --> 27:05.166
from current Isaac.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.752
And I have to tell you to listen to me...

27:07.919 --> 27:09.462
because right now I have clarity.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.798
You should not be having
this fucking baby.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.008
This baby's a mistake.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.593
The baby will ruin your life.
You'll ruin the baby's life!

27:15.760 --> 27:17.679
And then the baby
will fucking murder people!

27:17.846 --> 27:21.182
I don't know what you do at this point,
but get rid of this fucking baby!

27:21.349 --> 27:23.476
Put it in a bag and leave it somewhere!

27:23.643 --> 27:26.646
Put it in a basket
and push it down a fucking river!

27:26.813 --> 27:27.981
Fuck you, baby!

27:28.148 --> 27:30.525
Fuck your baby-fucking little arms...

27:30.692 --> 27:32.819
and your fucking chubby little
baby-fucking legs!

27:32.986 --> 27:36.114
Fuck you, baby! Fuck you! Cunt!

27:36.323 --> 27:37.741
Argh!

27:39.075 --> 27:40.076
Okay.

27:41.953 --> 27:43.079
Fuck.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.001
Have some fun! Yeah!

27:48.293 --> 27:49.294
Let's party!

27:55.842 --> 27:57.635
- Isaac?
- Fuck. Yeah.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.387
Hi, Sarah! Whaddup?

27:59.554 --> 28:00.764
- How's it going?
- All right.

28:00.930 --> 28:01.931
Good. Cool.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.391
What's going on? You good?

28:03.558 --> 28:04.559
You're so sweaty.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.269
It's hot in here. I run hot.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.562
We have this tradition
where we wear sweaters.

28:07.729 --> 28:08.855
I don't always
wear a sweater, obviously.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.191
When I'm inside I'd normally take it off.
I think it would hurt my friends' feelings.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.443
You're talking so fast,
you sound like an auctioneer.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.695
- That's funny. Sold!
- Ha-ha.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.989
- That was kind of scary.
- Sorry. I don't mean to scare you...

28:18.156 --> 28:19.991
- by going, "Sold!"
- Oh, my God!

28:20.158 --> 28:22.535
Ha-ha-ha. You shouldn't have said it.
Now it's all I can think about.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.204
- You want a drink?
- Okay. Sure.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.122
Let's have a drink.
I'll be right back.

28:26.289 --> 28:27.290
Thanks, Isaac.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.167
♪ Let's talk about sex ♪

28:31.086 --> 28:32.606
Betsy said
you've been asking about me.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.215
- That's a lie.
- It is. That's a lie. Heh, heh.

28:35.382 --> 28:39.469
Betsy would never in a billion years
say anything even remotely like that.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.262
How's your family?

28:41.429 --> 28:43.431
You're asking about my family.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.684
Sorry, I can't believe it.
Who are you?

28:46.851 --> 28:47.977
I deserve that.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.522
My family, thank you for asking, is fine.

28:50.688 --> 28:53.108
You usually stay with them
on Christmas Eve, no?

28:53.274 --> 28:56.486
Yeah, I'm staying with them,
but I'm going to this thing with Sarah.

28:56.653 --> 28:57.904
What is it?

28:59.739 --> 29:03.368
Okay, she's dating this guy,
and he got us into this party.

29:03.535 --> 29:05.370
And I know you've
always wanted to go to it...

29:05.537 --> 29:07.038
Shit.
Are you going to the Nutcracker Ball?

29:07.205 --> 29:08.456
Yeah. I'm sorry.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.624
We're going too.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.167
- You are?
- Isn't that crazy?

29:11.334 --> 29:13.086
I'm happy for you. Your last Christmas...

29:13.253 --> 29:15.338
and you get to go to the big dumb party
you've always wanted to go to.

29:15.505 --> 29:16.631
You bringing anyone?

29:16.798 --> 29:18.341
To the dumb party?

29:18.508 --> 29:20.927
- Any guys?
- Me?

29:21.094 --> 29:23.888
Yeah, I'm bringing these two guys...

29:24.055 --> 29:26.516
that I'm kind of dating.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.143
With really huge dicks.

29:28.309 --> 29:33.064
Who've got enormous,
almost novelty-sized dicks.

29:33.231 --> 29:35.442
I've been seeing a girl
with a huge vagina.

29:35.608 --> 29:36.734
Have you?

29:36.901 --> 29:38.528
I don't know if it really
has the same impact.

29:38.695 --> 29:41.281
I just hope that this
nice young lady's vagina...

29:41.448 --> 29:43.283
is not half as big as mine.

29:43.450 --> 29:46.369
- Your vagina. Woopidy-woopidy.
- The biggest! I know.

29:46.536 --> 29:49.247
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much. Appreciate that.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.231
- It's on your tab.
- Cool.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.179
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

30:04.345 --> 30:05.680
This is so much fun!

30:07.348 --> 30:08.516
Mm. Good beer.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.683
They say beer mellows you out a bit,
which is nice.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.248
This is kind of cool-tasting.
Tastes like pennies or something.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.913
- Weird. It has a coppery flavor?
- Yeah.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.316
Bizarre. Maybe it's the vodka?

30:16.483 --> 30:18.401
You know what?
I think they gave you a Crantini.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.820
You ever think maybe they're all
part of the same Tini family?

30:20.987 --> 30:22.071
Martini, Crantini.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.519
- It's just a funny idea, I thought.
- I guess it's funny.

30:25.867 --> 30:29.162
- Oh. Isaac. You have a bloody nose.
- Huh?

30:29.329 --> 30:31.247
- I what?
- Your nose is bleeding.

30:31.414 --> 30:32.499
My nose is bleeding?

30:33.541 --> 30:35.585
- Do you not feel that?
- Oh, no!

30:35.752 --> 30:37.420
It's fucked. There's a lot of blood.

30:37.587 --> 30:40.131
No, my nose is very tingly right now. And I
actually don't feel much. That's so weird.

30:40.298 --> 30:41.591
Holy fuck!

30:41.758 --> 30:43.176
What?

30:43.343 --> 30:44.594
Did you bleed in my drink?

30:45.178 --> 30:46.554
No.

30:46.721 --> 30:48.681
You fucking bled in my drink, Isaac!

30:48.848 --> 30:50.058
I'm gonna come clean.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.477
I'm on a lot of cocaine right now.
I think that's what made my nose bleed.

30:52.644 --> 30:53.770
You're on fucking cocaine?

30:53.937 --> 30:55.480
- Did you drink a lot of it?
- Kind of!

30:55.647 --> 30:57.127
- Is it that gross?
- It's mega-gross.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.358
I didn't do it on purpose.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.944
You're a totally fucking fucked-up person.
You should not be a father. Goodbye!

31:01.110 --> 31:02.320
Fuck you!

31:02.487 --> 31:03.571
Fuck you, Isaac!

31:03.738 --> 31:04.739
I'm sorry. Fuck you!

31:04.906 --> 31:06.199
No, fuck you!

31:06.366 --> 31:09.077
Piss off! People are fucking in here!

31:11.037 --> 31:13.456
- Zero, 11!
- Ah!

31:13.623 --> 31:16.125
Okay, now... Now, take a dump.

31:16.876 --> 31:17.919
What?

31:18.419 --> 31:20.922
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt.
Hey, Ethan.

31:21.089 --> 31:22.966
We need to get the fuck out of here.
I'm losing my shit right now.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.133
What happened?

31:24.300 --> 31:25.718
Please. I wanna go right now.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.929
- I'm right behind you.
- Thank you.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.389
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.765
Yikes.

31:31.266 --> 31:32.559
Uh...

31:32.767 --> 31:34.269
I guess that's my cue.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.521
- Tell her I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.189
I guess I'll see you later.

31:38.356 --> 31:40.358
Okay. Oh. Hey, hey, hey.

31:40.525 --> 31:41.985
This is...

31:48.366 --> 31:50.660
Come on, man.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.130
- Ethan.
- Have you seen Isaac?

32:02.297 --> 32:05.425
Forget Isaac. I just fame-fucked
that hipster chick in the bathroom.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.343
- So that's her?
- Hell, yeah.

32:09.262 --> 32:10.263
Can we go?

32:10.430 --> 32:11.556
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine! Let's go.

32:11.723 --> 32:12.890
It's after 10. We can call the
party number now.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.559
Let's call! Let's call!

32:14.726 --> 32:16.436
I'll get this address.

32:16.603 --> 32:18.563
This better fucking work.

32:19.939 --> 32:22.099
<i>If you want your Christmas merry...</i>

32:22.233 --> 32:25.278
<i>go to the corner of Grand and Berry.</i>

32:25.445 --> 32:26.446
Okay.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.656
Grand and Berry, please!

32:29.741 --> 32:33.494
Listen, listen. Diana is also
going to the Nutcracker Ball.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.581
- What?
- How crazy is that, right?

32:36.748 --> 32:37.749
She's cool. I miss her.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.555
Yeah, you shouldn't have
let her go, dude.

32:39.709 --> 32:42.253
You should totally get her back, bro.
My mom's named Diana.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.130
Yeah, thanks.
I didn't let her go.

32:44.297 --> 32:46.924
- She left me.
- You didn't wanna meet her parents...

32:47.091 --> 32:50.094
and you never did, and you just kept
making excuses for two years.

32:50.261 --> 32:52.597
She made the whole relationship
about the one thing I didn't wanna do.

32:52.764 --> 32:54.764
Dude, you fucked up.
Isaac, tell him, he fucked up.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.267
- You fucked up, man.
- See?

32:56.434 --> 32:58.519
Hey, Isaac. You okay?

32:59.270 --> 33:00.980
No, I'm not.

33:01.147 --> 33:04.734
I think the cocaine and the mushrooms
are reacting poorly.

33:04.901 --> 33:07.236
And now I think
I just got to balance it out.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.821
I got to make it
that I'm more on mushrooms...

33:08.988 --> 33:10.198
because I was having fun
on mushrooms.

33:10.365 --> 33:11.949
- I have a plan.
- Chill out. Have a Red Bull.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.327
You could also just
stop doing drugs right now.

33:14.494 --> 33:16.871
Like, much more mushrooms.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.040
- Are you gonna be cool at this party?
- Cool as fuck, G.

33:19.207 --> 33:20.792
No, you're not cool, G.

33:20.958 --> 33:23.044
You look insane.
Only your right eye is working.

33:23.211 --> 33:25.171
There's gonna be a lot of
famous people at this party...

33:25.338 --> 33:26.673
and I don't want you to fuck it up.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.091
You walk in there
looking like a shit show...

33:28.257 --> 33:29.384
Do I look weird now?

33:29.550 --> 33:31.552
Yes! You look weird!

33:31.719 --> 33:33.429
Still weird.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.056
Weirder!

33:35.223 --> 33:36.766
- He looks fine.
- No, you don't!

33:36.933 --> 33:39.018
You need to
fucking check yourself before...

33:39.560 --> 33:41.187
Before...

33:41.354 --> 33:43.481
- I wreck myself?
- Ugh.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.316
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

33:45.483 --> 33:47.443
Chickity-check myself,
before I wrickity-wreck myself?

33:47.610 --> 33:49.112
How does that make someone feel?

33:49.278 --> 33:50.998
To be told
that they might wreck themselves.

33:51.155 --> 33:52.156
You're not gonna wreck yourself.

33:52.323 --> 33:55.076
You made him feel bad.
Why don't you just leave him alone.

33:55.243 --> 33:57.363
- Look, he's not right, dude.
- Gonna mellow out.

33:57.412 --> 34:00.123
Why don't you have some weed
and mellow out.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.583
- You got the weed?
- No.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.169
- You got the weed, dude?
- No.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.755
- She stole my fucking weed.
- Ha-ha-ha.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.591
She was rummaging through my jacket
when I was hitting her from the back.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.260
I knew it! She fucking took my weed!

34:12.427 --> 34:13.719
That serves you right.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.347
Dude, it's not funny!
She stole my fucking weed!

34:16.514 --> 34:19.766
The last place I wanna be is
outside my mom's house right now.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.438
School's far. Your mom lives close.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.444
How long did Mr. Green say
he would be here in?

34:25.481 --> 34:26.690
Half hour.

34:26.858 --> 34:28.609
That's fine. Let's just go inside and wait.
I'm freezing.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.987
No, no, no. We're not going inside.
My mom's probably asleep.

34:31.154 --> 34:33.793
A half hour for Mr. Green could be like
two hours of standing here.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.826
We could be dead by then.
We could literally die by then.

34:36.993 --> 34:40.079
Look, my mom doesn't know I'm here.
So let it go. We're not going upstairs.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.540
- Really? You didn't tell her?
- No.

34:42.873 --> 34:45.293
I told her I was in Philly
and I got a suite down at the Gansevoort.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.860
I just think your mom would be happy
to see you on Christmas.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.630
I'm not saying she wouldn't be happy
to see me, all right?

34:50.797 --> 34:52.884
There's just a lot you don't understand.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.678
All she wants to do is parade me around
and show me off to people.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.722
Last time I was here,
she made me go to church with her...

34:57.889 --> 35:00.099
and sign autographs, kiss babies,
tell people all my stats...

35:00.266 --> 35:02.393
and what I did last Sunday.
It's too much.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.840
- I have a question.
- What?

35:03.978 --> 35:06.105
Does your mother
still have a Nintendo 64?

35:06.397 --> 35:08.608
Probably. She never
throws my stuff away. Why?

35:08.775 --> 35:10.985
Right. So that's why
you don't wanna go upstairs...

35:11.152 --> 35:12.945
because you're gonna lose
at "GoldenEye."

35:13.529 --> 35:14.864
- "GoldenEye."
- "GoldenEye."

35:15.031 --> 35:17.492
Okay. Let's do it. One game.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.993
Nobody touch shit.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.453
Nobody touch nothing.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.705
But I love touching things.

35:23.498 --> 35:24.791
Shh-shh-shh.

35:26.709 --> 35:28.169
All right, go, go, go.

35:34.383 --> 35:37.011
- Dude, did you die and not tell us?
- Shut up.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.304
It's amazing.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.511
I was there when you won this.
You must be so proud.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.391
Shut up and go.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.268
- Ooh! Your bedroom.
- Shut up.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.187
Dude.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.772
- Ethan.
- What?

35:47.939 --> 35:49.023
I found you.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.900
- You found me?
- Check you out.

35:52.026 --> 35:53.027
Oh!

35:55.029 --> 35:56.447
Look at you, man.

35:58.908 --> 36:02.620
You remember when we all first met at
the party? Whose fucking party was that?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.497
- Jocelyn Larue.
- Jocelyn Larue.

36:04.664 --> 36:05.748
Yeah, that's right.

36:05.915 --> 36:08.376
Remember the cops came?
We had to hide in the bathroom.

36:08.543 --> 36:10.127
For three hours.

36:10.294 --> 36:12.755
I was afraid we were gonna get caught,
because you were so fucking loud.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.216
I remember you wore that
Bob Marley tie-dye T-shirt...

36:15.383 --> 36:16.592
and I asked you
if you smoked weed?

36:16.759 --> 36:19.199
I didn't even smoke weed.
I just liked Bob Marley and tie-dye.

36:19.262 --> 36:21.097
I didn't get that was the vibe
I was putting out there.

36:21.264 --> 36:23.641
You could have showed up
with purple hair and a cloak.

36:23.808 --> 36:25.268
That was my warlock phase.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.228
- That was a dope phase.
- Hell, yeah.

36:27.395 --> 36:31.023
I'm surprised you even talked to us, Chris.
When I look back, I remember thinking:

36:31.190 --> 36:33.276
"This guy's a jock.

36:33.442 --> 36:36.696
And he's talking to a warlock
and a pretend pot-head."

36:36.863 --> 36:37.947
True.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.914
If it wasn't for y'all, I would have
never made it through that school.

36:41.492 --> 36:42.869
- Shit. Wait, pause it.
- No, no pause.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.079
The phone's buzzing.
You have to pause it.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.664
- I'm buying you weed!
- Shh. Just keep it down!

36:46.831 --> 36:49.311
Pause the fucking game.
If you shoot me right now, you forfeit.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.960
Oh, my God, if my mom wakes up.

36:51.419 --> 36:52.753
Yeah, it's him. Mr. Green's here.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.881
I'm never getting in that dude's car again.
He freaked me out.

36:55.089 --> 36:56.215
Shh.

36:56.716 --> 36:58.175
I'll go.

36:58.342 --> 36:59.719
Can you even walk?

37:01.345 --> 37:02.972
I can fly.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.980
Five-O, bro. You're busted.

37:11.147 --> 37:13.065
- Are you fucking kidding me right now?
- Yeah, I'm just kidding.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.859
- Holy shit, dude.
- Heh, heh.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.485
Don't do that.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.989
Oh, man. Hey, good seeing you, dude.
Long time.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.574
It has been a long time.

37:21.741 --> 37:24.076
- Been a long time, yeah.
- I remember you.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.747
And you know I'm proud
of what you've become.

37:28.122 --> 37:29.332
Husband, lawyer...

37:29.498 --> 37:32.543
soon-to-be father.
That's really impressive.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.795
Me, I don't have time for kids.

37:35.463 --> 37:38.215
- You're all my children.
- Yeah.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.718
You ever think of me as a father figure?

37:41.093 --> 37:42.845
No.

37:43.012 --> 37:45.723
Put your tiny hand in mine.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.684
Yeah.

37:48.851 --> 37:50.061
Rough night, huh?

37:50.227 --> 37:53.105
Little bit. Could you tell?
Am I wearing it on my sleeve?

37:53.272 --> 37:54.440
I did a lot of drugs.

37:54.607 --> 37:57.735
Mushrooms. Caps, too many caps.
Ate a lot of the caps.

37:57.902 --> 38:00.863
And I just think it kind of
made me freak out a little bit.

38:01.030 --> 38:05.034
And basically, I'm kind of just having
a hard time finding my place in all this.

38:05.201 --> 38:07.370
Relax.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.206
What's happening right now?

38:10.831 --> 38:13.042
Just looking into your soul, man.

38:14.877 --> 38:16.045
What are you seeing?

38:19.507 --> 38:21.217
You need a nice mellow indica.

38:21.384 --> 38:23.427
I got a great north Cali bud...

38:23.594 --> 38:26.097
with a soothing body high...

38:26.263 --> 38:29.350
and surprisingly accurate
visions of the future.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.728
Yeah, sure. Whatever you got, bro.

38:33.104 --> 38:36.440
Yeah. It's definitely a good time.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.275
Unless...

38:38.693 --> 38:42.238
you're dealing with some shit
you can't come to terms with.

38:43.614 --> 38:46.242
No! That's not me!
That's a different guy.

38:46.409 --> 38:50.830
I think all my issues are drug-related,
and my emotional state is completely...

38:50.997 --> 38:53.416
cool, bro.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.795
Taste a little shot of this.
See if you like it.

39:02.133 --> 39:03.175
Come on.

39:03.342 --> 39:08.431
I'm good. I think I'll just ride the wave,
my main man.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.267
I put my hands on you.

39:11.434 --> 39:13.269
Take it.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.521
Just not too hard.

39:18.024 --> 39:19.734
Not too hard.

39:22.653 --> 39:24.280
Where are we?

39:24.905 --> 39:26.657
A strip club.

39:26.991 --> 39:28.909
Eighteen years in the future.

39:29.076 --> 39:31.328
- Is that my wife?
- Yeah.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.539
You should probably talk to her.

39:33.706 --> 39:36.584
I'm gonna get a beer,
maybe a dance.

39:36.751 --> 39:38.544
Cool.

39:38.711 --> 39:39.795
Hi.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.756
Sit down. The show's about to start.

39:41.922 --> 39:42.923
Okay.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.968
<i>Okay, fellas, let's hear it for Sierra!</i>

39:46.177 --> 39:47.344
Whoo!

39:47.553 --> 39:48.888
Isn't she amazing?

39:49.055 --> 39:50.097
Who is that?

39:50.264 --> 39:52.141
It's our beautiful baby girl.

39:52.308 --> 39:54.935
What the fuck?

39:55.144 --> 39:57.480
Whoo! Pop it, girl! Pop that P!

39:57.646 --> 39:59.273
Pop it! Pop it!

39:59.440 --> 40:01.650
You hear me, young lady?
Pop your pussy!

40:01.817 --> 40:03.944
It's okay, sweetie!
You don't have to pop your pussy!

40:04.111 --> 40:07.406
You read all those books
and you didn't learn shit!

40:07.573 --> 40:09.825
You really shit the bed as a dad!

40:10.034 --> 40:11.077
Unh!

40:11.285 --> 40:14.121
Here you go. Drip, drop. Drip, drop.

40:15.998 --> 40:16.999
- I know...
- No!

40:17.166 --> 40:18.793
Look at my finger. Look at my finger.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.587
You need to give me a hundred bucks
and get the fuck out of my car right now.

40:21.754 --> 40:23.672
Okay! Here!

40:24.048 --> 40:25.216
Get out.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.455
What are you doing?

40:56.622 --> 40:58.862
I don't know what's happening.
Let's go. Let's just bail.

40:58.958 --> 41:00.251
Turn your phone off.
You're gonna wake her up.

41:00.417 --> 41:01.794
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know this song.

41:01.961 --> 41:03.754
- Turn it off.
- Hello?

41:03.921 --> 41:05.339
Hello?

41:06.048 --> 41:08.717
Hey, Ma. It's Chrissy-poo!

41:08.884 --> 41:11.387
Oh, my God! Chris!

41:11.554 --> 41:12.596
Hey.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.224
Oh, my God! Ethan!

41:17.101 --> 41:18.686
What are you guys doing?

41:18.853 --> 41:20.938
- Merry Christmas.
- Surprise.

41:21.105 --> 41:22.606
This is...

41:23.190 --> 41:25.401
Are you hungry?
I can heat up some food.

41:25.568 --> 41:27.403
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.655
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

41:30.239 --> 41:31.282
Sweetheart.

41:31.448 --> 41:34.243
- Oh, you smell like weed.
- No.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.163
- More meatloaf, Isaac?
- Huh?

41:37.371 --> 41:39.498
Um, no, I'm okay.

41:39.665 --> 41:42.168
Could I perhaps
have some more chardonnay...

41:42.334 --> 41:44.420
to wash down
my medication, please?

41:44.879 --> 41:46.797
Of course.

41:52.845 --> 41:53.846
Thank you.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.057
So, Ethan, what's going on with you?

41:57.266 --> 41:58.267
Uh...

41:58.475 --> 42:01.061
Not a lot. Just feeling good.

42:01.228 --> 42:02.897
You got somebody special in your life?

42:03.063 --> 42:04.231
No.

42:04.398 --> 42:07.443
There was a young lady that he
used to date that he ran into today...

42:07.818 --> 42:10.237
that I thought
was pretty damn awesome.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.615
- Yeah? What happened?
- It's a long story.

42:12.781 --> 42:15.741
Not that long. She wanted to get serious,
but he wouldn't meet her parents.

42:16.035 --> 42:17.286
She wanted to move in...

42:17.453 --> 42:20.253
and you said you weren't
in the right head place for her to move in.

42:20.289 --> 42:21.609
That's some straight-up bullshit.

42:21.749 --> 42:22.958
Give me some, Ma.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.501
Okay, okay, okay.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.420
What, are you guys
ganging up on me now?

42:26.587 --> 42:27.671
You like this woman?

42:27.838 --> 42:29.089
Yeah, she's awesome...

42:29.256 --> 42:32.134
but there's a whole history here
that he's brushing over.

42:32.301 --> 42:33.636
You want her back?

42:34.220 --> 42:36.013
Yeah. I do.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.599
If you want this woman,
you're gonna have to work for her.

42:38.766 --> 42:42.603
But you happen to be very lucky,
because it's Christmas.

42:42.770 --> 42:45.189
And there's magic in the air
at Christmas.

42:45.356 --> 42:48.025
People's hearts are open.
People want to forgive.

42:48.442 --> 42:50.486
People want love.

42:50.653 --> 42:52.488
I'd take advantage of that shit.

42:52.655 --> 42:56.992
- Find the opportunity, and seize it.
- Thank you, Mrs. Roberts.

42:58.452 --> 43:01.052
I almost forgot, I'm
gonna need some more headshots.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.793
<i>Huh. A dick
from someone named James?</i>

43:05.960 --> 43:08.087
<i>His name is on my phone,
I must know him. Who is he?</i>

43:09.630 --> 43:11.548
<i>Do I like it? What does that mean?</i>

43:11.715 --> 43:15.511
<i>Oh, man. Maybe it's
James McFoley from work.</i>

43:17.388 --> 43:18.389
<i>Holy shit.</i>

43:20.474 --> 43:22.142
<i>This guy's a grower and a shower.</i>

43:23.978 --> 43:26.188
<i>Do I like it more now? Jesus.
I mean, it's a dope dick.</i>

43:29.358 --> 43:31.235
<i>Do I want it?</i>

43:32.152 --> 43:34.488
<i>Who wouldn't want a dick
that looks like that?</i>

43:37.032 --> 43:38.867
<i>Do I wanna suck it? Oh, man.</i>

43:39.076 --> 43:40.160
Uh...

43:40.369 --> 43:42.913
<i>I'm gonna start putting people's
last names on my contacts.</i>

43:46.417 --> 43:52.172
<i>No, I've never sucked a dick but, well,
if I'm being totally honest with myself...</i>

43:55.467 --> 43:56.844
<i>Damn it, why'd I tell him that?</i>

43:57.011 --> 43:59.972
<i>This James guy is just
so easy to talk to. I told him too much.</i>

44:03.267 --> 44:05.269
<i>Man, I guess that settles it.</i>

44:05.436 --> 44:08.272
<i>Isaac Greenberg
is sucking his first dick tonight.</i>

44:08.856 --> 44:10.941
Did he tell you that they've
named a park after him?

44:11.108 --> 44:12.276
You're gonna have a park
named after you?

44:12.443 --> 44:14.737
I petitioned the city,
I got the signatures...

44:14.903 --> 44:17.573
and now there's gonna be the sweetest
little playground in Brooklyn...

44:17.740 --> 44:18.907
that's named after him.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.827
The park is not that nice!
There are crackheads and...

44:21.994 --> 44:23.662
Sweetheart, they're gonna
clean that up.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.123
We should get ready to go, guys. We have
to move. We're gonna miss the party.

44:26.290 --> 44:29.251
- That's true.
- Why don't I just wrap all of this up.

44:29.418 --> 44:31.754
You guys can take it down
to the homeless shelter.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.882
It's only a few blocks away.
I'm sure they'd appreciate it.

44:35.632 --> 44:36.675
You're right, Mom.

44:36.842 --> 44:39.094
You boys are so sweet.
Thank you for coming.

44:40.596 --> 44:42.556
- Wanna help me in the kitchen?
- Okay.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.283
Thanks so much for dinner,
Mrs. Roberts.

44:44.350 --> 44:45.976
You're welcome, sweetheart!

44:46.769 --> 44:48.896
Dude, what the fuck
is going on with you?

44:49.646 --> 44:51.190
- Are you gay?
- No.

44:51.357 --> 44:52.524
Are you curious?

44:52.691 --> 44:55.402
Everyone is! What does that
have to do with this?

44:55.569 --> 44:57.279
I don't know.
Why are you looking up dicks?

44:57.446 --> 44:59.907
- Someone's sending me dicks.
- Someone's sending you that?

45:00.074 --> 45:03.243
Look, I'll show you. It's a fucking
conversation. It's some guy named James.

45:03.410 --> 45:05.579
A very nice, eloquent man named James
is sending me his penis.

45:05.746 --> 45:06.955
And he wants me to suck on it.

45:07.122 --> 45:09.833
I don't know what to do. I'm fucking
freaking out. Do I do it? Should I do it?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.251
This isn't your phone, man.

45:11.418 --> 45:12.795
Dude, this isn't your phone.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.505
Oh, shit. Is this Sarah's phone?

45:15.381 --> 45:17.091
- Oh, no.
- What?

45:17.257 --> 45:18.675
She has my phone.

45:18.842 --> 45:21.261
It's okay, man. We know her.
We can get your phone back.

45:21.595 --> 45:23.305
There's something bad on my phone.

45:23.472 --> 45:25.099
You gonna be around tomorrow?

45:25.265 --> 45:27.976
Folks out at the church would love to
see you. Aunt would too.

45:28.143 --> 45:30.270
Um, you know I'm busy, so...

45:30.437 --> 45:32.106
I don't really like to do that stuff, Ma.

45:32.272 --> 45:33.607
Won't take much time, Boo.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.943
I know. It's just I have an early flight...

45:36.110 --> 45:38.779
and I really feel bad
that I have to run back to work so fast.

45:38.946 --> 45:40.781
I just got so much stuff going on.

45:40.948 --> 45:42.199
I'm a celebrity now.

45:42.366 --> 45:44.785
I got appearances.
I got all kinds of stuff I have to do, Ma.

45:44.993 --> 45:47.413
I can't just be lollygagging around...

45:47.579 --> 45:49.331
and meeting old people.

45:50.541 --> 45:51.750
I love you.

45:51.917 --> 45:54.086
Betsy is gonna get that tape
from Sarah...

45:54.253 --> 45:55.921
and she's gonna freak the fuck out.

45:56.088 --> 45:58.090
Why? Why would Betsy get the tape?

45:58.257 --> 46:01.427
Because I put cocaine blood
into her fucking drink.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.429
And no one
wants to drink cocaine blood.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.222
Yeah. I'm gonna call her.

46:05.389 --> 46:07.433
- How do you know her number?
- It's your number.

46:07.599 --> 46:08.767
I'm trusting you on this.

46:08.934 --> 46:11.145
I don't understand what's happening.
Where are we?

46:11.311 --> 46:13.063
Sarah has your phone.
So I'm calling it.

46:13.230 --> 46:14.648
Where are we right now?

46:14.815 --> 46:16.900
- We're at Chris' house.
- What the fuck?

46:17.067 --> 46:19.570
You just stay calm, all right?

46:19.736 --> 46:21.572
- It'll be okay.
- Oh, yeah.

46:21.989 --> 46:22.990
Oh, yeah.

46:23.157 --> 46:24.408
You like that?

46:24.616 --> 46:27.077
Okay. Here's the bad news.

46:27.244 --> 46:28.704
- She didn't pick up.
- What?!

46:28.871 --> 46:30.747
- Everything's fine.
- I bit my tongue.

46:30.914 --> 46:32.291
That boy need Jesus.

46:32.458 --> 46:33.625
He needs something.

46:33.792 --> 46:34.918
It's gonna be okay, though.

46:35.085 --> 46:37.379
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
use Find My iPhone and find the phone.

46:37.546 --> 46:40.424
It's loading. There it is! It's in midtown.

46:40.591 --> 46:43.093
- Your phone's in midtown. It's all good.
- Ha-ha!

46:43.260 --> 46:45.971
Okay. All right. So here's the thing.

46:46.138 --> 46:48.557
We're gonna go to the party,
because Sarah's gonna go to the party.

46:48.724 --> 46:49.766
Guys, let's go.

46:49.933 --> 46:51.768
- You be safe.
- Guys, be careful.

46:51.935 --> 46:52.936
Let's go, guys!

46:53.103 --> 46:56.273
Let me get you a bag.
You're gonna need a bag. Wait up!

46:56.440 --> 46:58.692
This guy's dick is off the charts.

46:58.859 --> 47:01.899
Yo, it's your man C-Rob coming at you
live from outside the homeless shelter.

47:01.945 --> 47:03.822
We delivering turkeys
to homeless people...

47:03.989 --> 47:06.867
because it's the giving season and they
do be gobbling, you know what I mean?

47:07.034 --> 47:10.662
If you're in the season of giving, hit me up
@Chrisrob11, hashtag "selfless giving."

47:10.829 --> 47:13.290
And remember, it's not a good deed
if no one knows about it.

47:13.457 --> 47:16.084
- I got another dick, dude!
- Uh, drink Red Bull.

47:17.127 --> 47:19.046
Oh, shit. Look, man, it's her!

47:19.213 --> 47:22.466
It's the super fan,
sex maniac that stole my weed.

47:22.633 --> 47:23.673
Come on, let's follow her.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.386
No, we're not gonna follow her. Let's just
drop off the food and go to the party!

47:26.553 --> 47:29.932
Shit! Look! Now she's stealing
from homeless people!

47:30.098 --> 47:31.475
That's not right!

47:31.642 --> 47:33.685
- Now, I'm going to teach her a lesson.
- Okay.

47:33.852 --> 47:36.563
Hey! Did you steal my weed?

47:36.980 --> 47:39.525
- Uh, no.
- We just saw you...

47:39.691 --> 47:42.011
rob some homeless people
and I'm missing my weed, so...

47:42.528 --> 47:44.780
You got me, I stole your weed.

47:44.947 --> 47:48.909
But I told you right away
that I'm kind of a Grinch. Okay?

47:49.117 --> 47:51.870
- Unh!
- Ooh. Eat me, sheep.

47:52.037 --> 47:54.357
You're an actual Grinch.
You're like the mayor of Whoville.

47:54.414 --> 47:55.916
I'm building a body of work.

47:56.083 --> 47:58.252
I'm following in the path
of my Christmas heroes:

47:58.418 --> 48:02.256
The Grinch, the Sticky Bandits,
Hans Gruber from <i>Die Hard.</i>

48:02.422 --> 48:06.260
I walked by you and I heard you
going on about your Christmas plans...

48:06.426 --> 48:10.138
and you're this football douche
and I Google you...

48:10.472 --> 48:12.808
Jackpot! I pretend to be a fan...

48:12.975 --> 48:14.268
we have sex, yes.

48:14.434 --> 48:15.602
And then I stole your weed.

48:15.769 --> 48:18.009
It's Christmas! You don't steal
from people on Christmas.

48:18.105 --> 48:19.398
I just want my weed back.

48:19.565 --> 48:21.233
You're really cute when you get mad.

48:21.400 --> 48:22.901
That's cute.

48:23.068 --> 48:26.321
This is the thing I didn't expect.
To fucking like you, dude.

48:26.488 --> 48:28.323
You are so funny...

48:28.490 --> 48:30.617
and talented, and handsome.

48:31.201 --> 48:33.245
And easy. My God, dude!

48:33.996 --> 48:35.205
Hey!

48:36.456 --> 48:38.959
I'm gonna fucking catch... Ah! Unh!

48:40.002 --> 48:41.295
Later, sucka!

48:41.461 --> 48:42.713
She <i>Home Alone'd</i> me!

48:42.879 --> 48:43.964
Are these Micro Machines?

48:44.131 --> 48:45.591
- Wow!
- Let's go.

48:45.757 --> 48:46.800
Girl's a genius.

48:46.967 --> 48:49.845
Josh, hit the gas! Go!
We got to catch that girl!

48:50.012 --> 48:52.572
Go down to the corner and make a right!
Hurry up, man! Chase her!

48:52.681 --> 48:54.850
- Who?
- The girl who stole my weed! Hurry up!

48:55.017 --> 48:56.351
- She stole your weed?
- Yeah.

48:56.518 --> 48:58.103
That fucking bitch. I'm gonna kill her.

48:58.270 --> 48:59.271
Go get her, baby!

49:01.648 --> 49:02.816
Not so fast!

49:08.447 --> 49:09.781
Guys, my iPhone's that way!

49:09.948 --> 49:12.188
We got to find my iPhone!
It's the other direction! Wait!

49:13.660 --> 49:14.703
Slow down!

49:14.870 --> 49:17.789
Speed up! Don't slow down!
If you're my guy, you won't slow down!

49:17.956 --> 49:19.082
Hit the gas! Hit the gas!

49:19.249 --> 49:20.250
Let's go.

49:25.255 --> 49:26.798
There she is! There she is!

49:26.965 --> 49:28.759
We got her! We got her!

49:29.718 --> 49:31.303
Red light, red light!

49:31.470 --> 49:33.555
No! You run that light! Are you my guy?

49:34.014 --> 49:35.015
I'm your guy.

49:35.182 --> 49:37.392
Give me your hand!
Go through that light, baby!

49:45.942 --> 49:50.072
Oh, I fucked up. I fucked up.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.449
I'm sorry.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.368
Unh! Oh!

49:54.576 --> 49:56.662
- Are we alive?
- Yeah.

49:56.828 --> 49:59.373
Look. Look, it's a sleigh.
We can still get her.

49:59.539 --> 50:01.375
No. Let's just go to the party, okay?

50:01.541 --> 50:02.834
We're going on a sleigh ride!

50:03.001 --> 50:04.294
No. We're not going on a sleigh ride.

50:04.461 --> 50:05.462
Come on, Joshua!

50:08.465 --> 50:09.633
Shotgun! Ha-ha-ha.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.635
Shotgun!

50:11.802 --> 50:14.083
- Hurry up.
- You guys know this can't possibly work.

50:14.221 --> 50:15.305
Of course it'll work!

50:15.472 --> 50:17.057
- Let's get that Grinch!
- Let's find my phone!

50:17.224 --> 50:19.768
- Mush, motherfucker!
- Whoa!

50:26.942 --> 50:28.151
I'm stuck!

50:28.318 --> 50:29.695
My hands are stuck!

50:31.446 --> 50:32.614
No, no, no!

50:32.781 --> 50:33.824
Fuck!

50:35.325 --> 50:36.326
Shit, shit, shit!

50:37.369 --> 50:38.662
Unh!

50:38.870 --> 50:40.163
Dude!

50:40.706 --> 50:42.499
What happened just now?

50:42.666 --> 50:44.209
He's okay. He looks okay.

50:44.376 --> 50:46.920
We have to go! She went this way!
Let's go get this weed!

50:47.087 --> 50:48.380
No. Forget about the weed, man.

50:48.547 --> 50:50.340
We're not gonna split up now.
Let's go to the party.

50:50.507 --> 50:53.227
No. You don't understand, man!
It's really important! It's for Tommy.

50:53.301 --> 50:54.428
It's not important.

50:54.594 --> 50:55.887
I'll meet you at the F Train.

50:56.054 --> 50:57.305
You fucking believe this guy?

50:58.640 --> 51:00.016
My phone! It's close! I got to go!

51:00.183 --> 51:02.519
- No. Listen to me.
- No. You listen to me.

51:02.686 --> 51:05.313
If I die, they will
play this video at my funeral!

51:05.480 --> 51:07.357
- Okay! You're on drugs!
- Yes!

51:07.524 --> 51:08.859
- You're not making sense!
- No!

51:09.025 --> 51:10.485
- Trust me.
- Okay.

51:10.652 --> 51:13.071
We're gonna stick together.
And go to the party.

51:13.488 --> 51:14.648
I'll meet you at the F Train!

51:14.781 --> 51:17.284
No! Dude! What the fuck!

51:18.660 --> 51:19.953
This is crazy.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.457
Oh, come on.
How does this fucking work?

51:23.623 --> 51:25.417
This is so confusing.

51:25.584 --> 51:27.169
Fuck!

51:27.335 --> 51:28.670
Ugh. My eyes aren't working.

51:28.837 --> 51:30.839
What asshole
invented this stupid thing?

51:35.260 --> 51:38.472
- Hey, man. Excuse me.
<i>- Hey, dude. How's it going?</i>

51:38.638 --> 51:40.390
- I'm Isaac.
<i>- Hi, Isaac.</i>

51:40.557 --> 51:41.850
I hate to bug you.

51:42.017 --> 51:45.270
I lost my phone, and I'm using this app
to try to find it.

51:45.437 --> 51:47.917
I'm kind of having a hard time.
It's confusing me a little bit.

51:48.023 --> 51:49.232
You think you can maybe help me out?

51:49.399 --> 51:50.734
<i>Sure, hold my cane for a second.</i>

51:50.901 --> 51:53.653
Awesome. Sure, I'll hold your cane.

51:54.196 --> 51:55.655
<i>Hey, Merry Christmas, Isaac.</i>

51:55.822 --> 51:57.532
Merry Christmas to you too, man.

51:57.699 --> 51:58.825
<i>Thanks.</i>

51:58.992 --> 52:00.994
I've been having a pretty crazy night.

52:01.161 --> 52:04.206
I'm gonna level with you,
I'm a little fucked up right now.

52:04.372 --> 52:06.875
<i>- Heh-heh. No way. You don't say?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

52:07.042 --> 52:09.002
- What's your name?
<i>- Spencer.</i>

52:09.169 --> 52:10.670
<i>That's my family over there.</i>

52:10.837 --> 52:12.798
Hi! I'm Isaac, nice to meet you.

52:12.964 --> 52:14.800
<i>- What's up, man?
- Hey.</i>

52:15.133 --> 52:16.968
You have dogs.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.304
- Can I pet them?
<i>- Go ahead. They're fine.</i>

52:19.471 --> 52:21.311
- Thank you.
<i>- You're very welcome.</i>

52:21.473 --> 52:23.642
- Hi, guys.
<i>- What's up, Isaac?</i>

52:23.809 --> 52:25.602
<i>Come on and give us a pat.</i>

52:25.769 --> 52:27.521
Oh my God, they talk! Ha-ha.

52:27.687 --> 52:29.189
<i>Of course. All dogs can talk.</i>

52:29.356 --> 52:31.399
- There's another one.
<i>- That tickles.</i>

52:31.566 --> 52:32.609
Oh, hi. I love you.

52:32.776 --> 52:33.944
Isaac?

52:35.904 --> 52:36.988
Betsy.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.323
Oh, shit.

52:40.826 --> 52:42.369
Hi.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.329
Wow. Ha-ha-ha.

52:44.538 --> 52:46.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:46.414 --> 52:47.541
Oh. Okay.

52:47.958 --> 52:50.252
I never wanna let go.

52:50.418 --> 52:51.878
What's happening?

52:52.045 --> 52:53.755
What are you doing here right now?

52:53.922 --> 52:56.132
What were you doing
in the nativity scene?

52:56.299 --> 52:57.884
I was hanging out
with Spencer and his family.

52:58.051 --> 52:59.511
- They're really beautiful people.
- Spencer?

52:59.678 --> 53:01.721
They're great people.
They're interracial.

53:01.888 --> 53:03.974
Why do you have the staff, honey?

53:04.349 --> 53:06.268
What's happening right now?
Where are we now?

53:06.434 --> 53:07.978
This is the church. Do you remember?

53:08.144 --> 53:09.813
- You're here for that?
- Yes.

53:09.980 --> 53:12.232
And I'm just telling you right now
that you need to go...

53:12.399 --> 53:15.151
because my family
is paying for the cab right now.

53:15.318 --> 53:17.445
So you need to get out of here
before they show up.

53:17.612 --> 53:18.613
- Your family is coming?
- Yeah.

53:18.780 --> 53:20.866
- So maybe go and run the other way.
- Where should I go?

53:21.032 --> 53:22.993
Just fucking go
before they get here. Go.

53:23.159 --> 53:25.412
I love you. Okay? I love you.

53:25.579 --> 53:27.789
- Okay. I love you. Bye.
- All right, bye.

53:27.956 --> 53:29.749
That's very sweet. Bye.

53:29.916 --> 53:31.793
What are you coming back for?
Just go that way!

53:31.960 --> 53:33.211
I don't know where...

53:33.378 --> 53:35.171
No, no, no! Not inside the church.

53:35.338 --> 53:36.506
Go, go, go.

53:36.673 --> 53:37.841
Get the fuck out of here.

53:38.008 --> 53:40.176
- Wait. I know them. Hi!
- Hi.

53:40.343 --> 53:41.678
Hi!

53:41.845 --> 53:44.325
- Oh, my God! Look at you guys.
- It's so good to see you!

53:44.431 --> 53:45.682
What a hat.

53:45.849 --> 53:48.268
Why don't you come join us.
Come on in for midnight mass.

53:48.435 --> 53:50.687
Oh, no. I don't think that's a good idea.

53:50.854 --> 53:51.855
Why not?

53:52.022 --> 53:54.274
Because he's hanging out
with his friends tonight. Right, Isaac?

53:54.441 --> 53:57.068
- I don't see anybody.
- I don't know where they are right now.

53:57.235 --> 53:59.195
- Come sit with us.
- I've never been in a church.

53:59.321 --> 54:00.447
Come on.

54:00.614 --> 54:02.115
Okay. Yeah?

54:02.282 --> 54:04.242
Yeah. Great! I'll see you in there!

54:04.409 --> 54:05.869
Let's go to midnight mass together.

54:06.036 --> 54:08.997
Okay. Yeah, if you say so.

54:09.164 --> 54:10.665
Save us a seat.

54:10.832 --> 54:12.334
How fucked up are you right now?

54:14.294 --> 54:16.588
I'm not fucked up at all, Betsy.
I'm your rock.

54:16.755 --> 54:18.048
You look like a crack rock.

54:18.214 --> 54:20.634
I'm not. Don't say that.
Are you mad at me?

54:20.800 --> 54:22.880
- No, just walk normal, please.
- I'm walking normal.

54:22.928 --> 54:24.387
No, you're not.

54:24.554 --> 54:26.890
Don't put it there, Isaac. Okay.

54:27.057 --> 54:28.391
And it's gone.

54:28.558 --> 54:30.685
Hi. Merry Christmas.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.110
Are you giving birth to piss?

54:39.277 --> 54:42.280
Oh, my God. I'm just
trying not to shit my pants.

54:42.447 --> 54:44.074
- You should.
- I should?

54:44.240 --> 54:45.784
You should just do it. Why not?

54:45.951 --> 54:47.551
I should just drop a deuce in my shorts.

54:47.619 --> 54:48.912
Just do it!

54:49.079 --> 54:52.374
That's great. Two more assholes
that don't give a fuck about Christmas.

54:52.540 --> 54:53.583
What?

54:53.750 --> 54:55.126
What are you guys doing?

54:55.293 --> 54:56.795
Santa pub crawl, bro!

54:56.962 --> 55:01.591
Guys, Santa Claus is a very
meaningful thing to a lot of people.

55:01.758 --> 55:04.010
A lot of children.

55:04.177 --> 55:07.847
Here's the thing, man. For those kids,
they're living a fucking lie!

55:08.014 --> 55:09.432
Yeah. Spoiler alert:

55:09.599 --> 55:11.685
Santa's not real, you pricky infant.

55:11.851 --> 55:13.311
This is a costume!

55:13.478 --> 55:17.565
But when you put on that costume
and you portray Santa Claus...

55:17.732 --> 55:22.237
you're taking a solemn oath
to represent certain values...

55:22.404 --> 55:23.989
that it represents!

55:24.155 --> 55:27.200
You know who you remind me of?
One of my angry elves.

55:27.367 --> 55:29.285
Fuck! No. Look, don't call me an elf.

55:29.452 --> 55:30.829
I think you got him with that one, Santa.

55:30.996 --> 55:32.622
Fuck you, "don't call me an elf!"
Motherfucker!

55:32.789 --> 55:34.791
Get back to the workshop!
You work for us, elf!

55:34.958 --> 55:37.043
- Go back to the workshop, elf!
- Ha-ha-ha.

55:37.711 --> 55:40.505
This little elf
has no friends on Christmas.

55:40.672 --> 55:42.590
My friends are just down there.

55:42.757 --> 55:45.969
Where are they? We're friends.
We even dressed the same...

55:46.136 --> 55:48.930
but you, you're all alone,
just like a fucking dum-dum.

55:49.097 --> 55:51.182
Oh, my God. Are you gonna cry? Aw.

55:51.641 --> 55:53.935
Did Mommy and Daddy
leave you alone on Christmas?

55:54.102 --> 55:55.812
Oh, shit!

55:55.979 --> 55:59.190
That's for disrespecting
the spirit of Christmas!

56:02.610 --> 56:03.611
Oh, fuck.

56:05.113 --> 56:07.532
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Fuck you!

56:07.699 --> 56:09.784
Man, this really feels like
it's about something else here.

56:09.951 --> 56:12.412
It's about this and only this!
Nothing else!

56:12.579 --> 56:14.414
I think you're sublimating, man.

56:14.581 --> 56:16.624
I do not wanna hurt you, man.

56:16.791 --> 56:18.791
No, no, no. I wanna hurt him.
He sucker-punched me.

56:21.713 --> 56:23.214
You fucking frat boys.

56:23.381 --> 56:25.133
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.177
I teach third grade, bitch!

56:27.343 --> 56:30.555
I shape our nation's youth!

56:30.722 --> 56:32.307
What is with this holiday?

56:32.474 --> 56:34.392
It just fucks with people's heads.

56:37.062 --> 56:38.688
This needs to be important to you.

56:38.855 --> 56:40.648
- It's ringing.
- Okay.

56:47.072 --> 56:48.073
Hey.

56:48.239 --> 56:49.908
Hey! Hi!

56:50.075 --> 56:53.912
Uh, does Isaac have Sarah's phone
by any chance?

56:54.079 --> 56:55.997
Yeah, he has it.

56:56.831 --> 56:57.957
- He has it.
- Thank God.

56:58.124 --> 56:59.125
So relax.

56:59.292 --> 57:01.461
There is some very sensitive information
on there.

57:01.628 --> 57:03.963
It's incredibly sensitive.
Wow, what's on the phone?

57:04.130 --> 57:05.215
You don't need to know.

57:05.381 --> 57:08.259
How's the party, huh? Is it as dumb
as you thought it'd be?

57:08.426 --> 57:10.845
Actually, it's kind of amazing.
It's really fun...

57:11.012 --> 57:13.681
and you should get here. Quickly.

57:13.848 --> 57:14.891
What? Huh?

57:15.058 --> 57:16.267
Really?

57:16.434 --> 57:18.978
You want me to come there?
To see you?

57:19.145 --> 57:21.231
That's what I'm saying.
Come on!

57:21.397 --> 57:22.899
Do you like him again?

57:23.066 --> 57:24.234
Can we not have that conversation...

57:24.400 --> 57:25.720

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:20.389
- No, no. We're friends.
- Am I the third wheel?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:21.599
No, no. You're the first wheel.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.642
- Am I the third wheel?
- Not at all.

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:26.145
I was with two other guys
and now I'm in a fight...

01:08:26.312 --> 01:08:27.938
Oh, really? Two other guys?

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.564
I'd love to hang out
with two other people.

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:31.024
Is that a challenge?

01:08:31.192 --> 01:08:32.609
It might be! Yeah.

01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:35.488
I don't know who I'm gonna start with,
but I know who I'm gonna end with.

01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:37.198
Well, let's get started right now!

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.492
- You guys wanna dance?
- I would love to dance.

01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.337
- I would love to dance.
- You wanna dance?

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:42.953
Let's do it! Come on, Isaac!

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.122
Oh, my God. This is so nice!
This is the best!

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:46.332
What a turn of events!

01:08:46.499 --> 01:08:47.500
What?

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:02.389
Holy fucking shit!

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.608
You're Miley Cyrus.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:13.901
Yeah.

01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:15.236
No, you don't understand.

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:18.697
I was just looking for this girl
that I love, and she loves you.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.584
Oh, God, no. I did that with two fans
one time. It got super awkward.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.078
That's not what I meant. Sorry, you don't
understand. That'd be awesome...

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:25.578
But, no, I just mean...

01:09:26.956 --> 01:09:30.209
This has gotta be some kind of Christmas
miracle, because she talks about you...

01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.336
and your song a lot.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:36.590
And I love this girl. I'm starting to
realize, tonight, she's the love of my life.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.718
And I wanted tonight to be sort of
a special night for me and her.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.930
- Now you're here and...
- You want to propose tonight?

01:09:43.096 --> 01:09:46.225
Oh, my God! That is so romantic.
That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:48.727
I mean, I was just thinking you could
like dedicate a song to her.

01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:51.354
What? You gotta propose.

01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:54.608
Come on! It's Christmas.
It's like, go big or go fucking home!

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:57.069
I mean, you love this girl.
You say you love her, right?

01:09:57.236 --> 01:10:00.447
Yeah. But I don't know
if tonight's the right time for...

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:03.367
Oh, God. Are you one of those guys
that are always making up excuses?

01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:04.952
I fucking hate those kind of guys.

01:10:05.119 --> 01:10:06.453
No, Miley Cyrus,
I'm not one of those guys.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.164
All right, then don't be a pussy!
You got to propose to her!

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:12.543
There's all this magic in the air,
people want to fall in love.

01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:15.713
Okay. Okay. Then I will.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.506
This is a sign if I've ever seen a sign.

01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:20.175
- It's gonna be fucking awesome.
- I'm gonna propose!

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:21.719
Yeah, you're gonna propose.
And I'm gonna help you out.

01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:24.680
We're gonna propose!
Oh, my God! We're gonna propose!

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:26.891
- We're gonna propose! Okay!
- Uh-huh.

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:29.777
Miley Cyrus, this is the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me!

01:10:29.894 --> 01:10:31.645
You gotta stop calling me Miley Cyrus.

01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:33.731
- What should I call you?
- Hannah.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.734
Just kidding. I'm drunk.
Let's do this thing!

01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:38.736
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Chris.

01:10:38.903 --> 01:10:40.988
- Yeah, what up, boy?
- Hey, what's up, K?

01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:43.449
Hey, Reverend Run, man.
It's your boy, Reverend Run.

01:10:43.616 --> 01:10:45.117
What that supposed to mean?

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:47.703
Hey, Messiah.
Check this shit out, dude.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.915
- Oh, shit. Is that you?
- The fuck is that?

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.666
Nah, it was a Make-A-Wish thing,
man.

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:56.378
Those two kids have Crohn's disease.
It was their wish to do karaoke with me.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:59.256
Man, damn dog,
you look just as white as they do.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:01.634
- Yeah, which one are you?
- Look at that sweater!

01:11:04.637 --> 01:11:07.723
I got you! I got you! I got you!

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.141
Oh, man!

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:10.768
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:11:10.935 --> 01:11:12.561
- You're a great dancer, man.
- Oh, thanks, dude.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:15.397
Appreciate it. I'm pretty high
on Molly right now.

01:11:15.564 --> 01:11:17.691
I'm high too. I'm high too.

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:19.985
- I am digging this beard.
- Thanks, man.

01:11:20.152 --> 01:11:22.446
- Yo, carpet match the drapes?
- Yeah, I got a big bush.

01:11:22.613 --> 01:11:25.324
- Ha-ha-ha.
- My carpet matches my drapes.

01:11:25.491 --> 01:11:29.203
Yeah. Look at this guy!
He's furry all over! Ha-ha.

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:30.996
Whoo! Nice!

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:33.843
You need to get the fuck out of here.
You're being a huge Cockblock.

01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm not being a Cockblock.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.377
- Yes, you are!
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:39.823
I don't think I could block this guy's cock.
It'd take ten men to block that thing.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.928
- Merry Christmas, New York City!
- Oh, no. Miley's here?

hang out with you on Christmas.

I understand that that's hard for you.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.947
That is not a reason for you
to grab onto me like I'm your lifeline!

01:15:35.407 --> 01:15:36.408
Why'd you say yes?

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:39.453
I said yes because
everybody was looking at me.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.539
I said yes, because Miley clearly wanted
me to say yes!

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:45.083
And I didn't want Miley to think
that I hated love!

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:48.045
That's understandable.

01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:50.005
I wouldn't want that either.

01:15:50.839 --> 01:15:52.591

01:15:54.051 --> 01:15:56.731
I was really just trying to do what I
thought you wanted me to do...

01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:58.680
and that's because I love you.

01:15:58.847 --> 01:16:00.182

I haven't stopped.

01:16:00.349 --> 01:16:01.600
I'm not gonna stop.

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.728
I'm not your answer...

01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:06.647

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.025

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.731
Hey, it's glass, man.
Why you picking it up?

01:16:49.898 --> 01:16:51.218
I'm just trying to help out, man.

01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:53.193
- Come on.
- Oh, shit!

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:56.905
Holy shit!

01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:58.532
I'm sorry!

01:16:58.699 --> 01:17:01.576
- Ah!
- The Jewish guy crucified the Messiah!

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:04.288
It was rabbi-dancing motherfucker!

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:08.166
- Ah!
- It's happening again.

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:12.671
Ethan! Ethan! Diana!

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.798
Congratulations!

01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:17.551
- No! Stop congratulating me!
- What? What happened?

01:17:17.718 --> 01:17:19.636
Just go talk to Ethan.

01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:21.096
Shit.

01:17:21.722 --> 01:17:24.933
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I think he's gonna be fine.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.101
Please, punch him in the face!

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:28.395
I thought the Messiah
preached forgiveness!

01:17:28.562 --> 01:17:30.522
Look at me, asshole.
What the fuck wrong with you?

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:33.567
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hey. He's my friend!

01:17:33.734 --> 01:17:34.943
Back off, man!

01:17:36.862 --> 01:17:38.572
Yo! Back the fuck up, all right?

01:17:38.739 --> 01:17:41.241
Oh, shit just got real, huh?
Yeah, go ahead and punch him, man.

01:17:41.783 --> 01:17:43.035
TMZ will love that shit.

01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:45.329
I got the biggest motherfucking phone
on the planet.

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:48.081
And your ass will be trending
in 10 minutes.

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:50.876
Who in here follow Chrisrob11?

01:17:51.043 --> 01:17:52.461
Put your fucking hands down!

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:54.796
- His social media game is crazy!
- Crazy!

01:17:54.963 --> 01:17:56.506
Run.

01:17:56.882 --> 01:17:59.634
Go, go. Get out. No! No!

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:01.553
Yeah! Ha-ha.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.765
- No, no!
- I'm a lawyer! I'm a lawyer!

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.240
- Magical night, isn't it?
- Jesus. You scared me.

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:24.368
Mr. Green.

01:18:24.993 --> 01:18:26.411
Man, you're everywhere tonight.

01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:29.915
I end every Christmas at this party.

01:18:30.082 --> 01:18:31.500
What do you mean?
How do you get in?

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:32.959
It's my party.

01:18:33.126 --> 01:18:34.127
What?

01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:36.338
About 20 years ago...

01:18:36.505 --> 01:18:38.673
I read <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

01:18:39.383 --> 01:18:41.051
I love that book.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:43.470
Movie's all right,
3D gives me a headache...

01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:45.680
but I'm a sucker for Leo.

01:18:47.599 --> 01:18:48.934
So this guy...

01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:52.145
he throws all these parties
and nobody knows who he is.

01:18:52.646 --> 01:18:55.315
I thought,
"Wow, that's pretty fucking cool."

01:18:55.816 --> 01:18:58.735
My cousin Larry's got this
giant warehouse in Brooklyn...

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:02.531
figured I'm working on Christmas
anyway, so I should do it too.

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:04.908
We started out pretty small.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:07.869
Just a punch bowl
and some sleigh bells...

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:12.624
and it gets bigger and bigger every year.
This year we added that train.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:14.709
- Through the trippy tunnel of lights.
- Yeah.

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:16.753
- Cool way to enter a party, right?
- Yeah.

01:19:18.213 --> 01:19:19.714
Hey, what'd you think of Miley?

01:19:20.132 --> 01:19:22.426
Yeah, she was great.
She was great.

01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:27.180
Ethan, you and I both know,
Miley was flawless.

01:19:28.723 --> 01:19:30.559
Something's bugging you.

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:37.065
Your friends,
they ain't gonna leave you.

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:38.859
They need you, kid.

01:19:39.443 --> 01:19:40.610
How do you know about that?

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.905
Smoke this.

01:19:44.364 --> 01:19:47.409
Nah, I'm good, man.
Weed makes me paranoid now.

01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:50.704
This is the staff of life.

01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:52.622
Okay. Heh, heh, heh.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:54.458
You're making me
a little uncomfortable.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:58.462
I've been told my quiet intensity
has that effect on people.

01:19:59.129 --> 01:20:00.881
But sometimes...

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:03.925
being uncomfortable
can be a good thing.

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:21.776
Fuck it. Thanks.

It's Christmas.

Let's hang out.

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:20.126
Go to my mom's house.
Play some "GoldenEye."

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:22.796
Come on. Look, I got some whiskey.

01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:24.923
I stole some hash from my brother.
Rolled it in this doobie.

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:27.384
We get pretty fucked up. Heh, heh.

01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:35.725

It's okay, man.

01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:47.988
I just miss them.

01:21:49.155 --> 01:21:50.282
We miss them too.

01:21:52.117 --> 01:21:53.827

whenever you need us, man.

Always, man.

01:22:05.589 --> 01:22:07.841
Yeah, always there for you, bro.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.761
You can't smoke that in here.

You can't smoke that in here.

01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:15.265

01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:18.476
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:20.523
- Fuck, that's crazy.
- What we hiding this for?

01:22:20.562 --> 01:22:21.896
Take a hit, dude.

01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:23.440
A little bit for the homeys.

01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:25.233
It's so cold outside too.

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:28.361
We should go to Christmas Tree
at Rockefeller Center.

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:30.614
- Ho-ho. Yes.
- That's a good idea.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.282
Then we go to FAO Schwarz...

01:22:32.449 --> 01:22:34.034
We dance on the piano!

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.202
- Like Tom Hanks in <i>Big.</i>
- "Heart and Soul."

01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:38.496
Then we eat Chinese food,
because I'm fucking high.

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:41.333
And then go to the karaoke spot
right by the Chinese food place.

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:43.752
- That's a fucking good idea.
- Heh, heh, heh.

01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.670

Oh, yeah? Listen.

01:23:08.652 --> 01:23:11.071
We need him!
We're not leaving without him!

01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:13.448
He's my best friend in the whole
world. I can't leave him here.

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:16.242
Don't let the red noses fool you,

01:23:16.409 --> 01:23:18.036
What if I run in,
and you try to climb in a window?

01:23:18.203 --> 01:23:20.083
Maybe if you boost me up
we can get around them.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:21.665
No, I can't boost you,
you're too heavy, man.

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:24.151

01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:45.647
How about that, Rudolph? Huh?

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.567
- Thanks, Mr. Green.
- You're welcome.

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:59.285
It was a pretty dumb thing you did.

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:01.092
I know. I didn't think it through at all.

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:02.956
I just saw her at the bar and just...

01:24:03.123 --> 01:24:05.625
I don't know man,
I really, really like this girl.

01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:07.335
I can't help it.

01:24:07.502 --> 01:24:11.131
I was scared of being alone
and did some stupid shit.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.383
I think she just wanted you to do...

01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:16.344

after two years of dating.

01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:18.805

I'm not normal.

01:24:18.972 --> 01:24:21.182

happened to me.

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:24.227
Or, I don't know,
maybe that's just an excuse.

01:24:25.937 --> 01:24:28.106
I guess I'm pretty good
at making excuses.

01:24:28.273 --> 01:24:29.941
- Yeah.
- All the time.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:32.902
If you get paid for that
you'd be really successful.

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:34.237
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24:34.404 --> 01:24:36.156
You know, it's hard to tell someone.

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:38.074
You have a good reason
to be making excuses.

01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:39.681
It's just kind of ruining your life.

01:24:44.164 --> 01:24:46.791
It's harder to stay friends
with people when you're older.

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:49.627
You have so much
of your own shit going on.

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:51.963

- No.

01:25:13.193 --> 01:25:16.073

many times? Oh, no, she's calling again.

they sent me on a spirit quest.

You know, like a spirit quest
in an Oliver Stone movie or <i>Young Guns.</i>

01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:10.643
And when that happened
I kind of realized...

01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:14.230
that maybe I've been lying to,
maybe, myself and you...

01:27:14.397 --> 01:27:17.191

about some stuff.

01:27:17.358 --> 01:27:18.518

01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:43.801
Honestly... Okay, I can't watch anymore.

01:27:43.968 --> 01:27:45.845
But honestly, I'm a little relieved.

01:27:46.012 --> 01:27:47.388
- You are?
- Are you kidding me.

01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:50.934
I feel like such a dumb asshole
compared to you sometimes.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.770
It's all been a lie. It's all been a front,
because I'm fucking freaking out.

01:27:53.937 --> 01:27:56.522
It's all just been to compensate
for the fact that I don't know anything.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:59.567
- This is good. You need to let it out.
- This is good?

01:27:59.734 --> 01:28:01.569
Yes. You need to not bottle it up.

01:28:01.736 --> 01:28:03.655
One of us has to be not freaking out.

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:06.032
- I'm actually okay.
- Really?

01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:09.119
All of a sudden I was just thinking
about everything you've been saying...

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:12.580
about how strong we are
and how we can handle it.

01:28:12.747 --> 01:28:14.248
And that made me feel better.

01:28:14.415 --> 01:28:15.458
Really?

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:18.711
Yeah. I really feel like I can do this.

01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:20.922

01:28:21.089 --> 01:28:23.633
- I'm your rock.
- You're my rock?

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.801
I'm Dwayne.

01:28:24.968 --> 01:28:26.888

01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.398
I'm gonna keep being honest.

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:41.693
I'm tripping my fucking balls off still,
and you look like a dragon right now.

01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:42.986

- Yeah.

01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:46.531

01:28:46.698 --> 01:28:47.740

it can't wait. Can you just
come out here for a sec and we'll talk...

01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:36.265

01:30:36.641 --> 01:30:38.810
First of all, I'm sorry about last night.

01:30:38.976 --> 01:30:41.354
- I know that was stupid.
- Yeah.

01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.524
And...

01:30:44.732 --> 01:30:48.027
And it was totally crazy
that I wouldn't meet your parents.

01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:50.446
That was just me being really...

01:30:50.613 --> 01:30:52.573
Yeah. I agree with that.

01:30:53.116 --> 01:30:55.660
But I guess I was...

01:30:56.786 --> 01:30:58.162
I don't know, scared...

01:30:58.329 --> 01:31:01.666
because Chris and Isaac have been
my family for the last 10 years...

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:04.377
so I didn't wanna meet your family...

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:06.838
because that would
change everything.

01:31:07.004 --> 01:31:09.048
But everything changes, right?
We all grow up...

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:12.426
and that's a good thing,
I wanna grow up. I do.

01:31:14.595 --> 01:31:16.556
I wanna grow up with you.

01:31:17.765 --> 01:31:19.267
And I do wanna have a family...

01:31:20.351 --> 01:31:22.562
other than two dudes.

01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:27.316
But I want that family to...

01:31:28.693 --> 01:31:30.653
I want it to be you.

01:31:31.445 --> 01:31:35.950
Which is probably worse
than proposing...

01:31:36.117 --> 01:31:39.328
because now we're talking
about you bearing my children.

01:31:39.495 --> 01:31:40.913
Yeah. It's a lot.

01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:45.376
But just pretend I'm saying it right,
if you could.

01:31:46.878 --> 01:31:48.754
I'd rather be the guy, from now on...

01:31:48.921 --> 01:31:51.632
who says too much than not enough.

01:31:51.799 --> 01:31:56.053
If we're being honest,
I should apologize to you also...

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.806
for stalking you, a little bit.

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.435
I knew that you were gonna be
at that bar last night.

01:32:03.102 --> 01:32:05.021
You pretended
like that was just coincidence.

01:32:05.188 --> 01:32:06.814
I did. And also...

01:32:06.981 --> 01:32:09.066
if we're confessing things...

01:32:10.026 --> 01:32:14.030
I do ask Betsy about you.

01:32:14.572 --> 01:32:16.199
Kind of all the time.

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:17.617
She doesn't let on.

01:32:17.783 --> 01:32:19.452
I know. Because she's my friend.

01:32:19.619 --> 01:32:21.219
I ask her about you
every time I see her.

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:22.872
Oh, I know.

01:32:23.414 --> 01:32:25.374
- Yeah.
- She tells me every time you ask.

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:28.541
- She doesn't tell me that you ask her.
- She's a girl. That's how it works.

01:32:31.422 --> 01:32:32.882

01:32:33.216 --> 01:32:34.634
In here?

01:32:35.593 --> 01:32:38.012
- This is my parents' house.
- I know.

01:32:38.179 --> 01:32:41.807
I thought that you didn't do parents.

01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:44.268
- I'll do your parents.
- Oh.

01:32:44.435 --> 01:32:46.020
