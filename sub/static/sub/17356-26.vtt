WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:09.141
- ¶

00:09.143 --> 00:12.378
- All right, we have
all day to build my hot tub.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.545
I sent my parents
to Sea Land,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.881
home of Flabby,
the world's chubbiest whale.

00:15.883 --> 00:20.152
- I heard you could see
his blubber from space.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.222
- You're home?!

00:23.224 --> 00:25.357
I mean,
yeah, you're home.

00:25.359 --> 00:25.991
[laughs]

00:25.993 --> 00:27.359
- Yeah, 'cause
that chubby whale

00:27.361 --> 00:29.294
kept splashing me
for no reason.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.563
- Hank, you kept
eating all his sardines.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.933
- I thought
it was free sushi.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.169
Who's this?
- Uh...

00:37.171 --> 00:39.304
this is my new
classmate, Wendell.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.205
He just moved here.

00:40.207 --> 00:43.342
- Max, he looks old
enough to be my classmate.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.911
Wendell Goldfarb,
Metroberg High?

00:45.913 --> 00:47.479
- Hank the Tank!
- BOTH: [laughing]

00:47.481 --> 00:50.449
- Oh, okay, the reunion's
over. Take five.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.554
- BARB: A hot tub
in your lair?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.322
Absolutely not!

00:57.324 --> 00:58.924
- I'm not building
a hot tub.

00:58.926 --> 01:03.362
- Hey, Max, is this bikini
okay for the hot tub?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.365
- HANK: There's
not gonna be one...

01:06.367 --> 01:08.100
and gross!

01:08.369 --> 01:10.969
- So, I should return
my other bikinis?

01:10.971 --> 01:11.937
- BARB, HANK, MAX:
Yes!

01:11.939 --> 01:13.939
- Max, you can't just
do stuff like this

01:13.941 --> 01:15.307
without checking
with us, first.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.943
- Hey, if I just checked
with you about everything,

01:17.945 --> 01:19.978
I would never
have a boat.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.679
- What boat?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.615
- Don't go changing
the subject.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.486
- Why do you have
to get the mail

01:27.488 --> 01:28.987
before your
parents see it?

01:28.989 --> 01:31.156
[gasps] Are you
hiding a report card?

01:31.158 --> 01:34.526
Phoebe Thunderman
got a bad grade.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.262
- Don't you joke
about that, Cherry--

01:37.264 --> 01:38.564
ever!

01:40.234 --> 01:41.233
No, I ordered something

01:41.235 --> 01:43.068
my parents would
never let me have.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.536
Oh, it's here!

01:44.972 --> 01:46.605
- Oh, sign here.
- Okay.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.273
- Initial here...

01:48.275 --> 01:49.374
and thumbprint here.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.376
- You don't need
a retinal scan?

01:51.378 --> 01:53.045
Oh, you do.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.283
- Ooh, what kind
of bad, bad things

01:58.285 --> 02:00.252
did you order,
Phoebe?

02:00.254 --> 02:01.019
- Peppers.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.388
- Don't throw your
life away for--

02:03.390 --> 02:04.389
Wait. Peppers?

02:04.391 --> 02:06.258
- Yeah, I discovered
different peppers

02:06.260 --> 02:07.659
do different things
to my heat breath.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.229
My parents say the peppers
will mess up my powers.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.663
But I say
they'll make me

02:11.665 --> 02:12.731
a more awesome
superhero.

02:12.733 --> 02:18.704
Here, let's see what
the Fijian Face Melter can do.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.705
[crunching]

02:19.707 --> 02:21.373
[clears throat]

02:22.343 --> 02:24.676
- [breathing fiery air]

02:25.012 --> 02:29.548
- Whoa! That was
scary and festive!

02:29.550 --> 02:30.382
- I know!

02:30.384 --> 02:32.451
Bad guys won't know
whether to scream in fear

02:32.453 --> 02:34.586
or scream,
"Happy New Year!"

02:36.056 --> 02:38.023
- But how are you
gonna sneak those

02:38.025 --> 02:39.124
past your mom and dad?

02:39.126 --> 02:41.026
- Oh, pffft!
It won't be hard.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.094
They're yelling
at Max.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.062
When they're focused on him,
I'm completely invisible.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.565
- And another thing,
that hot tub is dangerous.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.333
- Oh, please, how is
a large tub of water

02:48.335 --> 02:51.270
filled with electrical
equipment dangerous?

02:51.472 --> 02:54.173
- Water and electricity
do not mix!

02:54.175 --> 02:56.308
I play a risky
game every day

02:56.310 --> 02:57.109
just taking a shower.

02:57.111 --> 02:59.578
- You know, you guys
never let me do anything.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.179
- Oh...

03:00.181 --> 03:01.446
- A hover toilet,
a cliff-diving school,

03:01.448 --> 03:03.749
using the animalizer to
turn Billy into a T-Rex.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.050
It's always no.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.319
- See? Completely
invisible.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.287
- Hey, Phoebe is--

03:08.289 --> 03:10.322
- Don't bring Phoebe
into this.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.224
She's not even here.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.325
- But she's--

03:13.327 --> 03:15.160
- The one you should
be more like. We know.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.596
- Listen, young man,
this is our house,

03:17.598 --> 03:21.066
so, you will
follow our rules.

03:21.068 --> 03:21.767
- Fine!

03:21.769 --> 03:22.768
I'm going to my lair.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.071
- I think you
mean our lair.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.072
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

03:27.074 --> 03:29.274
- HANK & BARB:
Parents!

03:29.276 --> 03:34.246
- ¶

03:34.248 --> 03:37.249
- Try to hit
this fastball, Billy.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.817
[grunts]

03:40.487 --> 03:42.254
Nice pitch, Billy!

03:44.792 --> 03:47.359
- Show yourself,
pizza face!

03:47.361 --> 03:49.161
[lasers zapping]

03:50.497 --> 03:51.797
- Come on,
Princess Bobo,

03:51.799 --> 03:55.267
save some cookies
for the rest of us.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.202
- What a day.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.104
We're playing outside,
having a blast,

03:59.106 --> 04:01.373
about to be hit
by the Thundervan.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.441
Thundervan?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.308
Wait!

04:03.310 --> 04:05.377
- [whooshing]

04:05.379 --> 04:07.579
- Beep-beep, kids.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.647
- [whooshing]

04:08.649 --> 04:09.815
- Dad, what are
you doing?

04:09.817 --> 04:12.484
This driveway
is no place for a car.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.653
- Well, the city keeps
giving me parking tickets,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.722
so, now I've gotta keep
it in the driveway.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.624
- But--
- Hey, don't blame me.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.392
Blame Johnny Law!

04:20.561 --> 04:23.528
- Now we have to find
somewhere else to play.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.331
- I know a great place
in Madagascar.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.332
[zooming]

04:27.334 --> 04:29.868
- She meant
in this country.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.404
- ¶

04:32.406 --> 04:33.538
- All right, Gideon,
you're sure no one

04:33.540 --> 04:35.841
saw you come down here
with that jackhammer, right?

04:35.843 --> 04:37.709
- Nobody,
not even your mom.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.644
Which reminds me,

04:38.646 --> 04:41.280
is she into guys
with power tools?

04:41.282 --> 04:43.282
- Remember when you
told me I could hit you

04:43.284 --> 04:45.183
when you go too far?
- I do.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.718
- [thwacks helmet]

04:47.855 --> 04:48.854
All right,
let's do this.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.289
Thanks to my parents'
stupid rules,

04:50.291 --> 04:52.190
I need you to help
me build my hot tub.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.692
- When I've had enough
of my parents,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.694
I go to my Grandpa
Giddy's penthouse.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.429
He doesn't have
any rules.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.864
- Oh, that
sounds awesome.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.600
My grandpa just sends me
hand-me-down socks.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.871
These were knitted
in World War II.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407
All right, you're
sure the jackhammer

05:08.409 --> 05:09.207
is super-silent, right?

05:09.209 --> 05:10.475
- Yeah, the guy at
the hardware store

05:10.477 --> 05:12.844
charged me extra
for the silent model.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.479
- [jackhammer thudding]

05:14.481 --> 05:16.782
- I think
he lied to me!

05:16.784 --> 05:18.183
- Turn it off!

05:18.185 --> 05:19.318
- What?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.386
- [jackhammer thudding]

05:21.388 --> 05:23.155
[jackhammer stops]

05:25.626 --> 05:28.193
- Uh...
[laughs] Gideon!

05:28.195 --> 05:30.595
I told you my parents
said no hot tub.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.632
Why would you try to
force such luxury on me?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.768
- Gideon, will you
give us a minute?

05:36.770 --> 05:40.505
- Barb, I'd give
you the whole day.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.606
- [raps helmet]

05:41.608 --> 05:43.942
- Got it. Too far.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.279
- I thought we were
clear when we said

05:47.281 --> 05:49.815
no dangerous hot tub
in the lair.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.418
- My bikinis
need to be seen!

05:54.755 --> 05:55.887
- Dude, not helping.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.458
- Max, we warned you
and now you are grounded.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.759
- You can't ground me.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.861
I already live
underground.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.797
- Then you are
undergrounded.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.499
- But I'm a superhero.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.500
- Superhero or not,

06:08.502 --> 06:10.369
as long as you live
under our roof,

06:10.371 --> 06:11.636
you have to follow
our rules.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.773
- Well, maybe I shouldn't
live under your roof, anymore.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.841
- What are you saying?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.943
- I'm saying...

06:17.945 --> 06:19.544
that I'm moving out.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.979
- No-o-o-o-o-o!

06:20.981 --> 06:23.448
Wait, am I coming
with you?

06:24.218 --> 06:25.283
- Definitely not.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.520
- No-o-o-o-o-o!

06:28.522 --> 06:30.555
- ¶

06:30.557 --> 06:31.656
¶ What you see ¶

06:31.658 --> 06:32.858
¶ Is not what you get ¶

06:32.860 --> 06:36.528
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

06:36.530 --> 06:37.996
¶ We fit right in ¶

06:37.998 --> 06:39.398

06:39.400 --> 06:40.966
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

06:40.968 --> 06:42.667
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

06:42.669 --> 06:44.603
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

06:44.605 --> 06:46.505
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

06:46.507 --> 06:47.939
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

06:47.941 --> 06:49.541
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

06:49.543 --> 06:51.410
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

06:51.412 --> 06:52.844
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:52.846 --> 06:53.945
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:53.947 --> 06:57.616
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:57.618 --> 07:01.753
¶ Livin' a double life ¶

07:05.392 --> 07:07.626
- That's right,
Hank and Barbara,

07:07.628 --> 07:09.628
you won't have me
to kick around

07:09.630 --> 07:10.429
with your stupid rules.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.464
Max Thunderman
doesn't live here anymore!

07:12.466 --> 07:14.666
- And just where do you think
you're gonna live, Mister?

07:14.668 --> 07:18.570
- I'm moving into Grandpa
Giddy's no-rules penthouse.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.104
- You are?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.373
- See? Gideon
says it's okay.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.441
- You know what?
Move out.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.509
It'll be a good
learning experience for ya.

07:24.511 --> 07:28.380
- Yeah, maybe even learn
to wash your own underwear.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.347
- I won't need to.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.616
I'll just turn
them inside out.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.519
- He'll be back
by dinnertime.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.120
- No, I won't.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.855
Because I can take
care of myself.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.758
Gideon, help me
with my stuff?

07:44.798 --> 07:45.997
Come on, Gideon.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.933
- Sorry about
the jackhammer.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.001
- [door slams]

07:50.003 --> 07:53.738
- ¶

07:53.740 --> 07:54.539
- This is awful.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.607
- Yeah, it's
a little flakey,

07:55.609 --> 07:57.542
but ice cream
will fix that.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.779
Oh, you mean the Max thing,
yeah, terrible.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.914
- With Max gone,
my parents will be

08:02.916 --> 08:03.715
all up in my business.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.885
All I want is to keep
eating my peppers in peace

08:06.887 --> 08:09.721
and unlock their
spicy secrets.

08:10.757 --> 08:11.990
[crunching]

[clears throat]

08:13.393 --> 08:15.093

08:15.095 --> 08:18.763
- Woo! The Carolina
Dragon pepper's a keeper.

08:18.765 --> 08:19.498
- [laughs]

08:19.500 --> 08:22.567
Yep, it'll terrify bad guys
and clean out my sinuses.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.935
- CHERRY:
[laughs]

08:23.937 --> 08:25.871
- Phoebe?
You're flushed.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.706
- Are you feeling
okay, honey?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.541
- Oh, what? Um...
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.909
I was just
out in the sun.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.777
- [sighs] This
is why we have rules

08:32.779 --> 08:34.679
about wearing sunscreen.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.882
- No. No.
- [sunscreen spritzing]

08:36.884 --> 08:39.017
- [sunscreen splooshing]

08:39.186 --> 08:43.421
- Is this what you meant
by "in your business"?

08:43.423 --> 08:44.823
- Yeah.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.363
- Whoa, Max really
did move out of the lair.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.465
- Yeah, he'll be back
for me, though.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.767
He's just getting
my room ready.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.801
Who am I kidding?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.704
I'm never gonna
see my Maxy again!

08:59.706 --> 09:00.605
[sobbing]

09:00.607 --> 09:03.542
- I can't believe this
huge room is gonna be empty.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.378
Anyway, let's go find
a place to play.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.780
- Billy, this is
where we're gonna play.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.682
- No, you're not!

09:10.684 --> 09:11.816
This is still my room,

09:11.818 --> 09:14.686
so, I'll decide
what happens to it.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.122
Now, because I have
a big heart--

09:17.124 --> 09:18.890
- And a big booty.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.059
- Let me finish.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.595
I will pick one of
you rooty-pooties

09:23.597 --> 09:25.730
to use the lair
as your play area.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.433
- But we're used to being
together when we play.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.435
- One of you
or none of you.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.804
That's my big
booty offer.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.907
- All right,
let us think about it.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.044
All right, guys,
I've thought about it.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.880
It's really more of
a huge booty.

09:43.116 --> 09:47.085
- This is about the offer.
Keep up, baby.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.853
- If we do it
Colosso's way,

09:48.855 --> 09:50.989
at least one of us
will get their dream playroom.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.691
- I just hope
he doesn't turn it

09:52.693 --> 09:54.659
into some weird
competition.

09:54.661 --> 09:55.627
- Hmmm...

09:55.629 --> 09:57.829
- [game show music]

09:57.831 --> 09:59.764
- Who's ready to play...

09:59.766 --> 10:03.134
- AUDIENCE:
Share the Lair!

10:03.136 --> 10:06.638
- Everybody hears
those voices, right?

10:09.209 --> 10:12.611
- ¶

10:12.613 --> 10:14.879
- This is
my favorite room.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.681
This says I am rich

10:16.683 --> 10:18.783
and a little crazy.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.654
- This is amazing!

10:22.656 --> 10:24.623
How can you afford
such a cool place?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.225
- Grandpa Giddy used
to be a big-time DJ.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.162
- Wait.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.665
You're DJ Partyface?

10:34.501 --> 10:37.035
- You...wiki-wiki...
know it.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.806
- Oh, I appreciate you
letting me move in here.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.041
- Oh, no problem.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.044
I know how
lame parents can be.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.647
Mine are still
driving me nuts.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.882
- Wow, they must
be like 200.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.785
...times cooler
than my parents.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.653
[nervous laughter]

10:54.655 --> 10:57.188
So, uh, Gideon says there
are no rules here, huh?

10:57.190 --> 10:57.856
- That's right.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.092
- Buck-aw! Buck-aw!
Buck-aw! Buck-aw!

11:01.094 --> 11:02.527
Buck-aw! Buck-aw!

11:02.529 --> 11:03.695
Buck-awwwww!

11:03.697 --> 11:05.764
- [objects clattering]

11:06.033 --> 11:09.734
- You see, I don't
even know that chicken.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.171
- Well, this place
is almost perfect.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.141
There's only one
more thing it needs.

11:16.143 --> 11:16.808
- Huh?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.677
- An ambulance
for the chicken?

11:18.679 --> 11:22.681
- A jet engine-
powered hot tub!

11:22.683 --> 11:24.549
- Jet engine
hot tub?

11:24.551 --> 11:27.619
Oh, that
sounds illegal.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.653
I love it!

11:28.655 --> 11:30.755
No rules!
[laughing]

11:30.757 --> 11:32.757
- [palm slap]

11:33.560 --> 11:34.292
- Ever since Max left,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.960
my parents haven't
given me a minute to breathe.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.163
This is the first chance
I've had to eat a pepper.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.031
- Are you sure
you won't get caught?

11:40.033 --> 11:40.732
- No, we're good.

11:40.734 --> 11:44.202
I told them I was meeting with
my coding club, Bases Coded.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.838
- All right,
which one is up next?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.239
- Let's see.

11:49.776 --> 11:50.975
They're gone!

11:50.977 --> 11:53.712
Someone pilfered
my peppers.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.014
- HANK:
You mean...

11:56.016 --> 11:57.582
these?

11:57.584 --> 12:01.653
- Mom, Dad, what are you
doing at Coding Club?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.054
- Drop it, Ms. Missy.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.756
We know you've been
eating the peppers,

12:04.758 --> 12:06.624
even though we told
you not to.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.726
- Okay, I have, but...

12:07.728 --> 12:10.929
you guys are always telling
me to eat my vegetables.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.731
So, which is it?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.200
- Actually,
those are mine.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.735
As a kid, they called me
"Peter Pepper"

12:16.737 --> 12:20.071
because I loved peppers
and looked like a boy.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.043
- No!
- [crunching]

12:25.045 --> 12:29.147
Mmmmm! Tastes so--

12:29.149 --> 12:30.882
Ah, Phoebe!

12:30.884 --> 12:33.151
It feels like
I swallowed fire!

12:33.153 --> 12:35.153
[screaming]

12:36.923 --> 12:38.356
- Okay, so those
weren't hers.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.326
When I eat them, they make
my heat breath more awesome.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.660
- Phoebe, you know
the rule!

12:42.662 --> 12:45.697
You can't eat spicy peppers.
It's too dangerous.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.232
You know, your great-
grandmother,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.134
Matilda-Jo Thunderman
had heat breath like you.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.302
- One day, she ate
chili peppers and burped.

12:51.304 --> 12:55.173
She turned the Mojave Rainforest
into the Mojave Desert.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.909
- Why are you guys worrying
about me, when Max--

12:57.911 --> 12:59.244
- Max is out
in the world

12:59.246 --> 13:01.279
learning you can't
fix your problems

13:01.281 --> 13:03.782
by turning them
inside out.

13:04.785 --> 13:05.850
- But you are
still here,

13:05.852 --> 13:08.253
which means you have
to follow our rules.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.055
- Mm-hm, so,
say bye-bye to these.

13:11.057 --> 13:11.990
- Well, wait.

13:11.992 --> 13:16.027
Come on, at least leave me
the Tokyo Throat Stabber.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.363
[heavy sigh] I've
gotta get Max back home.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.931
- CHERRY:
Ahhhh, Phoebe!

13:19.933 --> 13:22.333
It feels like
it's stabbing my throat!

13:22.335 --> 13:24.636
- Come on.
- Ow!

13:24.805 --> 13:26.404
- And with all the extra
space the lair has,

13:26.406 --> 13:28.206
I could put up targets
just like this

13:28.208 --> 13:30.742
all over the room.
- [buzzer rings]

13:33.380 --> 13:35.346
- Well, that ping-pong
storm means it's the end

13:35.348 --> 13:38.416
of the Tell Me
Your Dumb Idea round.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.219
Now let's
continue playing...

13:41.221 --> 13:43.922
- AUDIENCE:
Share the Lair!

13:43.924 --> 13:46.724
- Let's begin
the Bribe round.

13:46.726 --> 13:47.358
- What's a bribe?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.828
- It's when you three
offer me nice stuff,

13:49.830 --> 13:52.230
so I pick you
as the winner.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.165
- But that's not right.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.934
- Uh, duh!

13:56.770 --> 14:00.438
Better get those bribes
in before it's too late.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.106
- Guys, this is
just Colosso

14:02.108 --> 14:04.008
trying to turn
us against each other.

14:04.010 --> 14:04.742
And it's working!

14:04.744 --> 14:06.010
I'll give you all
my birthday money!

14:06.012 --> 14:08.680
- I'll give you all
my tooth fairy money!

14:08.682 --> 14:10.381
[whooshing]

14:10.383 --> 14:13.785
- Hey, how many teeth
have you lost?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.121
- Who do I make
this check out to?

14:17.123 --> 14:18.857
- Who do you think?

14:18.859 --> 14:19.924
- All right.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.260
"Who Do You Think?"

14:22.429 --> 14:25.330
- Colosso, you do not want
to pick Billy's sports room.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.364
- Well, don't pick
Nora's room,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.833
unless you like
getting zapped.

14:28.835 --> 14:29.734
She's got bad aim.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.337
- How is this for bad aim?
[lasers zapping]

14:32.339 --> 14:33.238
- Ow!

14:33.240 --> 14:35.940
See? She was
aiming for Chloe.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.243
- If you pick
my playroom,

14:38.245 --> 14:39.911
then you can
have lots of tea.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.947
- Everyone knows she makes
her tea with toilet water.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.483
- I can't reach
the sink!

14:45.485 --> 14:48.987
- ALL:
[mixed comments]

14:50.123 --> 14:53.124
- Ha. Ha.
Isn't she something?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.460
- She reminds me
of my fifth wife.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.463
I still can't believe
I married a hot tub.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.033
- I don't know. Are you
sure about the jet engine?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.902
- Uh, duh!

15:04.070 --> 15:07.305
How else is it gonna
be super turbo-charged?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.407
- But what if the fuel
leaks into the water?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.942
- Will you quit
worrying.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.277
[scoffs]
You hear this guy?

15:12.279 --> 15:16.080
- Barely. My hearing
aid's not working.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.217
- Isn't jet fuel
flammable?

15:19.219 --> 15:20.485
- No rules!

15:20.487 --> 15:23.021
Max can do
whatever he wants.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.923
- Hi, guys!

15:24.925 --> 15:28.426
- Oh, come on!
Lock a door, people!

15:28.428 --> 15:29.460
- No rules!

15:29.462 --> 15:33.064
Any random can walk
in here, when they want.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.198
- You heard
Grandpa Giddy.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.501
So, if you're here
to prom pose to me,

15:36.503 --> 15:37.869
my answer is yes.

15:37.871 --> 15:38.870
- I'm not here
for you.

15:38.872 --> 15:42.040
- Aw. I'm here
for you, too, boo.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.476
- You're wearing
her down, Gideon.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.378
- Max, you have
to come home fast.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.346
Dad threw out his back

15:48.348 --> 15:51.282
trying to pick
up a muffin he dropped.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.818
- You're lying.
Dad hates muffins.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.787
He calls them
"healthy cupcakes."

15:55.789 --> 15:57.088
- [sighing]
Okay, fine.

15:57.090 --> 15:57.922
Without you at home,

15:57.924 --> 15:59.390
mom and dad are
constantly watching me.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.860
I have no peppers
and I am covered in sunblock.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.963
- Well, I'm not
goin' back.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.997
Here at Grandpa Giddy's

16:05.999 --> 16:08.166
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

16:08.168 --> 16:12.904
- Wait. Could I do
anything I want here?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.839
I'm never leaving!

16:14.841 --> 16:16.007
- Hey, you need
to sign for that.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.242
- Who do you think
you are, my mother?

16:18.244 --> 16:21.579
- ¶

16:24.351 --> 16:25.817
- ¶

16:25.819 --> 16:27.185
- Grandpa Giddy,
this place is sick.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.420
- And you haven't seen
the best part yet--

16:29.422 --> 16:31.155
the door. Bye!

16:32.125 --> 16:34.092
- Max, Phoebe can hang
out here, if she wants.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.228
- Yeah, don't kick out
my grandson's prom date.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.263
- We are not
going to prom.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.365
- Fine!
[sighs]

16:40.367 --> 16:43.167
I guess since you're clearly
dating Gideon, you can stay.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.268
- We are not dating!

16:44.270 --> 16:47.305
- Come on, Gideon,
it's hot tub time.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.973
Help me find
my rubber ducky.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.076
- Grandpa, it's in
the rubber ducky room.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.147
- Well, since you've
barged in on my pad,

16:56.149 --> 16:57.548
I'm gonna barge in
on your peppers.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.884
- Hey, that's my
Himalayan Hot Butt.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.252
- Not anymore.
No rules!

17:01.254 --> 17:04.255
[crunching]

17:04.257 --> 17:06.224
[fiery fart]

17:07.927 --> 17:11.262
Don't tell anyone
you saw that!

17:11.264 --> 17:12.397
- The only thing I see

17:12.399 --> 17:14.432
is this Lithuanian
Lava pepper.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.901
You may be outlawed
in 17 countries,

17:16.903 --> 17:19.237
but you are welcome
in my belly.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.939
[crunching]

17:21.941 --> 17:23.875
[liquid gurgling]

17:23.877 --> 17:25.043
[breathing fiery breath]

17:25.045 --> 17:26.411
- [engine explodes]

17:26.413 --> 17:29.013
- [flames roaring]

17:29.015 --> 17:30.915
- Oh, my beautiful baby!

17:30.917 --> 17:32.417
- Don't worry.
I'll put it out.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.484
[breathing fiery air]

17:33.486 --> 17:36.254
- Ah! My beautiful
baby, again!

17:36.256 --> 17:37.255
- All right, you try.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.857
Something's wrong
with my freeze breath.

17:39.859 --> 17:40.525
- [fiery fart]

17:40.527 --> 17:43.294
Oh, something's
wrong with my everything!

17:43.296 --> 17:48.132
- ¶

17:48.134 --> 17:50.435
- Everyone, I've
made my decision.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.636
I've used all
the bribe money

17:51.638 --> 17:55.206
to build the lucky
winner's dream playroom.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.307
- The room is mine!

17:56.309 --> 17:57.575
- In your dreams, fool!

17:57.577 --> 18:00.611
- It's toilet tea time!

18:01.047 --> 18:04.015
- The lucky
winner is...me!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.452
Welcome to
Colosso World!

18:07.454 --> 18:10.121
- AUDIENCE:
[cheering, applauding]

18:10.123 --> 18:11.656
- [game show music]

18:11.658 --> 18:15.993
- Whoever you are,
stop cheering for him!

18:16.196 --> 18:18.362
- I don't get it.
How did we all lose?

18:18.364 --> 18:21.165
- Because Colosso tricked
us into fighting each other,

18:21.167 --> 18:22.333
then stole all
our money

18:22.335 --> 18:24.335
so he could build
this stupid rabbit shack.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.304
- [bell dinging]
- Correct!

18:26.306 --> 18:28.206
Now get out!

18:28.374 --> 18:30.341
- Guys, we should have
walked out the second

18:30.343 --> 18:31.943
he said only one
of us could win.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.377
- Yeah, what good
is the place,

18:33.379 --> 18:36.013
if we can't play
by ourselves together?

18:36.015 --> 18:39.984
- Wait. I know something
we can do together.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.486
- COLOSSO:
Uh...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.955
what are you
guys doing?

18:44.991 --> 18:45.957
Why aren't you gone?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.925
- 'Cause we're about
to play a new game.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.962
- NORA, BILLY, CHLOE:
Trash the Lair!

18:50.964 --> 18:51.629
- [lasers zapping]

18:51.631 --> 18:54.232
- COLOSSO: Hey, what
are you guys doing?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.567
Stop! I don't
deserve this!

18:56.569 --> 18:59.971
Okay, maybe I do,
but stop anyway!

18:59.973 --> 19:00.638
- [lasers zapping]

19:00.640 --> 19:03.241
- COLOSSO:
Wizard Bunny, no!

19:03.243 --> 19:04.642
Ah, cut it out!

19:04.644 --> 19:07.111
Oh, we could
share the lair!

19:07.113 --> 19:09.380
Oh, no, I bought
that in Bombay!

19:09.382 --> 19:11.115
That's an original.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.151
- What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.418
- Stop asking me
what we're gonna do!

19:14.420 --> 19:18.156
- GRANDPA GIDDY: Hey, Max,
turn the hot tub down.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.257
It's very hot in here.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.092
- We know.
We're working on it.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.527
- If that fire reaches
the jet engine,

19:22.529 --> 19:23.661
this entire place
is gonna blow up.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.064
- Phoebe, I think you're
exaggerating a little.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.332
- [explosion]

19:28.334 --> 19:29.167
- You were saying?

19:29.169 --> 19:31.002
- Oh, there's gotta be
something in the fridge

19:31.004 --> 19:33.237
cold enough to get our
freeze breath working.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.672
- Oh, yeah.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.144
- BOTH:
[spitting milk]

19:40.146 --> 19:42.146
- Oh, mine's chunky.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.114
- It's 'cause
it's spoiled.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.149
Grandpa Giddy scratched
out the expiration date

19:45.151 --> 19:46.217
and just wrote
"No rules!"

19:46.219 --> 19:48.619
- There's gotta be
something else cold enough.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.556
The only thing in the freezer
are these fish pops.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.291
- What's a fish pop?

19:53.293 --> 19:54.992
- This!

19:57.497 --> 19:58.229
- Oh!
- Uh!

19:58.231 --> 20:00.431
Mine's looking at me.
- It's so scaly.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.699
- Ah!

20:02.168 --> 20:04.202
Okay, let me
try my freeze breath.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.536
[breathing frosty air]

20:05.538 --> 20:08.706
Oh, it's not cold enough.
Try yours.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.074
- [fiery fart]

20:10.076 --> 20:12.310
Don't tell anyone
about that, either!

20:12.312 --> 20:13.177
- [fire sputtering]

20:13.179 --> 20:15.546
- Max, we're out of time.
We've got to evacuate everyone.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.648
- You get the Giddys,
I'll save myself.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.449
- What?

20:18.451 --> 20:23.054
- [imitating sirens]

20:31.231 --> 20:32.730
- Grandpa Giddy,
you did it.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.199
- Luckily, my grandpa
has one rule.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.468
- Always have the fire
extinguisher ready

20:37.470 --> 20:39.804
when there
are no rules.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.607
- We're sorry
we almost blew up

20:42.609 --> 20:43.808
your luxury condo.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.344
- Oh, it's not
the first time.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.146
- Phoebe, I'm beginning
to wonder whether

20:49.148 --> 20:52.049
mom and dad were right
about us needing the rules.

20:52.051 --> 20:52.783
- What tipped you off?

20:52.785 --> 20:55.219
The jet fuel
or when you farted fire?

20:55.221 --> 20:58.556
- You said you wouldn't
tell anyone about that.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.690
- Wanna go home?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.791
- Yes, please.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.793
I'm out of underwear.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.702
- Mom, Dad, we apologize
for not listening to you.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.538
- Well, we're not gonna
say we told you so,

21:14.540 --> 21:16.374
we're gonna do
this, instead.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.676
- HANK & BARB:
Parents!

21:18.678 --> 21:20.478
- From now on,
I'll show you designs

21:20.480 --> 21:21.646
for all my
dangerous devices.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.750
- Uh, how about you don't
design any dangerous devices?

21:25.752 --> 21:28.252
- Fine! But
I'm keeping my boat--

21:28.254 --> 21:30.755
that I definitely
don't have.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.124
- Well, I'm just
glad my babies

21:33.126 --> 21:34.692
finally learned
their lesson.

21:34.694 --> 21:38.229
But we do need
to know one thing.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.765
How long's
he staying here?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.535
- Oh, uh, just long enough
for his penthouse

21:44.537 --> 21:47.838
to stop smelling like
fish pops and jet fuel.

21:49.242 --> 21:50.408
- Or longer.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.544
No rules!
[laughing]

21:53.546 --> 21:57.581
- Buck-aw! Buck-aw!
Buck-aw! Buck-aw!

21:57.583 --> 21:59.350
Buck-aw!

22:02.588 --> 22:05.423
- Seriously,
who is that chicken?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.558
- ¶

22:10.430 --> 22:25.476
- ¶
