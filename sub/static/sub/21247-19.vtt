The fire break's done, Kion.

Great job, Fuli.

KION: (PANTING)
Great work, guys.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.397
The fire could have been
a lot worse for Ma Tembo
and the elephants.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.335
Kilio Valley is safe now,
Ma Tembo.
You're good to go back.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.105
MA TEMBO:
Thank you, Kion. Lion Guard.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.140
Too bad you didn't
get here sooner.

01:48.175 --> 01:50.375
My favorite grove's
been completely burned.

01:51.112 --> 01:54.480

what could have been.

Uh, guys? Do you see that?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.018

02:00.054 --> 02:02.020
I don't know. Ono?

It's fire! From the sky!

02:08.295 --> 02:10.462
They must be embers
from the fire!

02:10.498 --> 02:12.131
I thought we put 'em all out!

02:12.166 --> 02:14.333
Well, clearly you missed some!

If you'd put out the fire
properly to begin with,

still have a home!

06:22.249 --> 06:23.415

You know... Fires do clear
the way for new plants
to grow.

It's true. Our Valley
will return. And so will we.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.427
MA TEMBO: But in the meantime,
we elephants need a new place
to live.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.296

be together.

rely on us hyenas.

who made this day a success.

"success?"

Kilio Valley is ours,
for as long as we remain
and lay claim to it.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.311

to stay here?

We will take over
the Pride Lands piece
by piece.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.056

for the Lion Guard to defend!

Hush, Zito. It looks like
a fine place to stay.

08:32.246 --> 08:35.113
It is. It's big,
there's lots
to eat,

08:35.148 --> 08:37.415
and the galagos are always
really welcoming!

Welcome!

See?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.320
Laini, there was a fire
in Kilio Valley,

08:42.356 --> 08:46.057
so Ma Tembo
and her elephants...
Need a place to stay?

08:46.093 --> 08:47.325

08:47.361 --> 08:49.227

for another hippo

LAINI: Kion,
this is a disaster!
A disaster!

09:19.192 --> 09:21.293
It's okay, Laini.
I've got this.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.095
Elephants, hold still!

09:27.134 --> 09:29.167
See? Everything's okay now.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.237
But only because
they're not moving!

09:32.272 --> 09:35.373
When they walk the ground
shakes, and the trees move,
and...

09:35.409 --> 09:39.377
MA TEMBO: We elephants
don't want to cause
any trouble for you, Laini.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.047
We can find some other place
to stay.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.315
Really?

09:46.219 --> 09:47.419
I mean...

09:47.454 --> 09:50.989
If you think Kion can
find you someplace else...

09:51.024 --> 09:53.058
Oh, without a doubt.

09:53.327 --> 09:57.028
I said I'd find you
a new home, and I will.

Giraffes and elephants
are both big.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.309
You both eat leaves.
It's a perfect match!

10:11.511 --> 10:16.147
I suppose...
If they really need
someplace to stay...

10:16.183 --> 10:17.215
Thank you, Twiga.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.485
Ma Tembo, you and your herd
are welcome in Acacia Grove!

What a relief.
Thank you, Twiga.

Yeah... It really is.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.501

What are you doing?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.169
Uh-oh.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.437
I'm eating.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.173
But you pulled down the whole
branch!

10:42.509 --> 10:45.510
Well, yes.
It's how we elephants eat.

Look around!

10:56.390 --> 10:59.524
Twiga, I know the elephants'
ways are different.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.459
But please. They need help...

11:01.495 --> 11:03.228
Then get someone else
to help them!

11:03.263 --> 11:05.463
If they stay here,
they'll eat our whole grove!

Giraffes need food too, Kion!
Do you want us to starve?

11:10.270 --> 11:13.371
I guess the giraffes
don't want us around either.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.207
I'm sure it's not that.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.376
She's worried about
her own herd, that's all.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.479

we can go, isn't there?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.214

the perfect place!

11:23.250 --> 11:26.051
Lots of space,
beautiful groves of trees.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.154
Oh, wait.
The Lion Guard let it burn.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.488
There is another place.

to figure out where.

is gone, Bupu.

Not much.

in Kilio Valley.

just go home?

Because Scar wants them
to stay.

That must have been his plan
all along.

12:51.505 --> 12:54.139
He didn't just want to scare
the elephants.

over Kilio Valley, forever.
