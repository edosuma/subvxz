00:03.093 --> 00:05.427
Oh, Cece. Are you two kids
back together?

00:05.445 --> 00:07.947
- She wishes.
- No, plumbing's out-- severe clogging.

00:07.981 --> 00:09.649
- I'm sorry I asked.
- This is what happens.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.651
Four models with
protein deficiencies,

00:11.702 --> 00:13.435
sharing a shower.

00:13.453 --> 00:16.786
They shed like a... like
a four-dollar Christmas sweater.

00:17.157 --> 00:18.607
Guys, guess what?

00:20.225 --> 00:22.327
I just made a breakthrough
with a student.

00:22.378 --> 00:23.579
Yeah, it's true.

00:25.165 --> 00:26.849
- Don't, please.
- Uh, Jess?

00:30.119 --> 00:31.986
You know we love you,
we all support you...

00:32.021 --> 00:33.455
♪ I'm breaking through
with students. ♪

00:33.473 --> 00:36.806
...but when you do things
like this, I'm sorry... bowl.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.894
Okay.

00:42.516 --> 00:43.683
It's just not satisfying.

00:43.734 --> 00:44.850
- I think it is.
- Okay.

00:44.901 --> 00:46.352
You said you had
a breakthrough.

00:46.403 --> 00:48.320
It's just a whole new world
teaching adults.

00:48.355 --> 00:49.605
This week, I gave
them an assignment.

00:49.639 --> 00:51.357
I said write whatever you want

00:51.408 --> 00:54.210
just load it up
with descriptive imagery.

00:54.244 --> 00:55.611
My fluffy pillow,

00:55.645 --> 00:57.363
my yellowy fluffy pillow,

00:57.414 --> 01:00.747
next to my dog, my hairy dog,
my beloved hairy dog,

01:01.367 --> 01:02.317
while I diddle myself.

01:02.335 --> 01:03.185
Excellent.

01:03.220 --> 01:04.953
He was a merman.

01:04.988 --> 01:07.723
He was the last of his kind,

01:07.758 --> 01:11.091
and he needed a mother
for his mer-child.

01:11.561 --> 01:14.894
He was not a mer-gentleman.

01:17.334 --> 01:19.168
Can't wait to hear more.

01:19.186 --> 01:21.070
I just can't connect with them
and I don't know why.

01:21.104 --> 01:23.022
Look, Jess, you can't teach
people how to write.

01:23.056 --> 01:25.007
- Not true.
- I say that as a writer.

01:25.025 --> 01:27.176
- Also not true.
- A writing class is for

01:27.194 --> 01:28.811
somebody who doesn't think
lyrically in terms of,

01:28.845 --> 01:32.178
like, poetic words
that just... are strung...

01:33.900 --> 01:35.034
You said you had
a breakthrough.

01:35.068 --> 01:36.368
So I have this student
whose name

01:36.403 --> 01:38.304
is Edgar
and he was not getting it.

01:38.355 --> 01:39.355
And then today

01:39.389 --> 01:41.023
he turned in this amazing story.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.975
Nick, actually,
you should read this.

01:43.026 --> 01:45.144
Writers don't read--
we write.

01:45.195 --> 01:47.196
Jessica Day calls it
"A must read."

01:47.230 --> 01:48.597
Look at that font.

01:48.615 --> 01:50.699
What is this amateur hour?

01:50.734 --> 01:53.202
At least use Palatino.

01:53.236 --> 01:54.236
Good evening, everyone.

01:54.270 --> 01:55.771
Or should I say morning?

01:55.789 --> 01:57.540
Hey, Winston.

01:57.574 --> 01:59.107
Do you guys have any agave?

01:59.126 --> 02:00.442
We might have some
pressed lentil syrup

02:00.460 --> 02:02.110
in the mixin's cabinet.

02:02.129 --> 02:05.047
Thank you.

02:08.952 --> 02:10.619
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay, uh...

02:10.637 --> 02:11.921
- Okay, you know what?
- Hey, look...

02:11.955 --> 02:13.288
I just felt the
side, the side

02:13.306 --> 02:15.891
- anyway, so it's...
- I didn't mean to...

02:15.926 --> 02:17.393
It's fine, it's...

02:17.427 --> 02:18.677
Other way, now.

02:18.728 --> 02:19.762
- I will fight you, Jack.
- No, not again.

02:19.796 --> 02:21.630
Not... no!

02:21.648 --> 02:24.366
- No!
- Jump out the way, Jessica?

02:24.401 --> 02:25.601
What the hell is wrong
with you just waving

02:25.602 --> 02:27.436
that thing around
like an idiot?

02:27.470 --> 02:28.571
♪ Who's that girl?

02:28.605 --> 02:31.239
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪

02:36.012 --> 02:38.845
Guys, listen to this.

02:38.982 --> 02:41.483
"By day, I'm a plumber.

02:41.501 --> 02:42.918
By night, I'm a stalker."

02:42.953 --> 02:44.036
You read it.

02:44.087 --> 02:45.421
"I sit in the bushes

02:45.455 --> 02:48.788
wearing a gimp costume,
stalking my prey."

02:49.092 --> 02:50.476
He's the first
person I got

02:50.527 --> 02:52.111
to use first person narrative.

02:52.145 --> 02:53.896
♪ I'm an amazing teacher.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.281
- Very engaging, keep going.
- I'm hooked.

02:55.315 --> 02:57.483
Okay, "My prey is a deer.

02:57.534 --> 02:59.601
"Her eyes are big, too big.

02:59.619 --> 03:02.488
"Before she can blink
those big eyes,

03:02.539 --> 03:04.106
"I'm stabbing her.

03:04.124 --> 03:06.242
"I stab and stab.

03:06.276 --> 03:08.177
I love stabbing."

03:08.211 --> 03:09.245
Sounds like
he likes stabbing.

03:09.279 --> 03:10.946
"After all the stabbing..."

03:10.964 --> 03:11.780
It's repetitive, but...

03:11.798 --> 03:13.115
"...I wash my hands

03:13.133 --> 03:14.416
in her dark red blood"?!

03:14.450 --> 03:15.251
Listen to that detail.

03:15.285 --> 03:17.136
This man is psychotic.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.637
It's fiction.

03:18.672 --> 03:21.290
There's no such thing
as a gimp costume.

03:21.308 --> 03:22.808
- No, gimp costume's a real thing.
- That's a real thing.

03:22.809 --> 03:23.959
You've seen me in one before.

03:23.977 --> 03:25.644
I just don't think
you should be in a room

03:25.679 --> 03:27.479
with this creep, twice a week.

03:27.514 --> 03:28.981
It is not safe.

03:29.015 --> 03:30.465
Are you worried about me,
Miller?

03:30.483 --> 03:31.934
Yeah, I'm a little worried
about you.

03:31.968 --> 03:32.985
And if you won't do

03:33.019 --> 03:34.486
anything about it,
then I'm taking

03:34.521 --> 03:35.938
into my own hands.

03:35.972 --> 03:37.940
I'm doing a little
investigation.

03:37.974 --> 03:39.325
Investigating? Please.

03:39.359 --> 03:40.776
You're just gonna
Google his name.

03:40.810 --> 03:44.143
I am way beyond that.

03:44.247 --> 03:45.698
You're typing his
name into Google.

03:45.749 --> 03:47.032
We can all see the screen.
See the screen, dude.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.668
This is a private investigation!

03:49.703 --> 03:51.287
Are you... I wanted
to talk to you

03:51.321 --> 03:52.872
about the...

03:52.923 --> 03:54.540
regrettable contact

03:54.591 --> 03:56.041
between Cece's...

03:56.092 --> 03:57.376
her-her down there

03:57.427 --> 03:59.295
and my, uh...

03:59.329 --> 04:00.713
my parts.

04:00.764 --> 04:02.014
You practically
shish-kebabbed her.

04:02.048 --> 04:03.498
Is this something
I should apologize for?

04:03.516 --> 04:04.666
Just let it go, man.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.835
You pogo'd her.

04:06.853 --> 04:08.888
I'm sorry,
what did you say, "pogo"?

04:08.939 --> 04:11.223
- I didn't, um...
- I heard

04:11.274 --> 04:13.008
"Pogo" -- what is that?

04:14.344 --> 04:15.728
Look, Winston, fine.

04:15.779 --> 04:17.228
It's what we call what you did

04:17.279 --> 04:19.197
this morning, okay?

04:19.732 --> 04:21.200
It's a short...
it's a shorthand.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.201
Why do you have
a shorthand, Schmidt,

04:22.235 --> 04:23.202
because it happens so often?

04:23.236 --> 04:24.653
You pogo'd me once.

04:24.687 --> 04:26.688
- You pogo'd Jess twice.
- Hey, it's not sexual.

04:26.706 --> 04:28.324
Nick's never been
pogo'd directly.

04:28.358 --> 04:30.709
You did get his pizza one
time... which, by the way,

04:30.744 --> 04:32.378
is a whole nother debate--
how did you not feel that?

04:32.412 --> 04:33.528
Let me get this straight--

04:33.546 --> 04:34.663
you guys sit around
and talk about this?

04:34.697 --> 04:36.081
Your penis actually
changed the channel,

04:36.132 --> 04:38.200
uh, when we were watching
the Bears game once.

04:38.218 --> 04:39.201
You don't think
me, Nick and Jess

04:39.219 --> 04:40.252
talk about you behind your back?

04:40.303 --> 04:41.337
Because we do.

04:41.371 --> 04:42.704
You have more pogos than anyone.

04:42.722 --> 04:44.840
You are completely
misusing the word pogo.

04:44.874 --> 04:47.709
You are the pogo king.

04:50.229 --> 04:52.431
Pogo king.

04:52.482 --> 04:54.500
Pogo king?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.635
So I wanted to talk about your
creative imagery assignments.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.871
Wow, guys.

04:58.905 --> 05:01.807
I really felt like I was buried

05:01.841 --> 05:04.760
under a giant, gleaming, powdery

05:04.794 --> 05:06.461
avalanche of adjectives.

05:08.131 --> 05:09.982
Don't mean to interrupt,
I just hear you're the best

05:10.016 --> 05:12.017
- teacher of adults?
- Oh, no.

05:12.068 --> 05:13.669
- I wonder if there's
room for one more? - No!

05:13.687 --> 05:15.270
How you guys doing?
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

05:15.304 --> 05:17.373
- Not now, okay?
- I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.

05:17.407 --> 05:19.425
I'm here to learn how
to write short fiction.

05:19.459 --> 05:21.043
Oh, okay, Julius, just...

05:21.077 --> 05:22.244
take a seat and, um,

05:22.262 --> 05:23.262
keep small.

05:23.296 --> 05:24.579
I'm from Chicago.

05:24.597 --> 05:26.081
Thin-crust pizza?
No, thank you.

05:26.099 --> 05:27.549
I'm from Chicago.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.801
So, for a fun follow-up...

05:29.652 --> 05:31.437
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, problem, Edgar.

05:31.471 --> 05:33.138
We're just going over our

05:33.189 --> 05:35.257
- descriptive imagery.
- I'm sorry, dear,

05:35.275 --> 05:36.591
I can't hear you.
Mr. Pepperwood?

05:36.609 --> 05:38.777
I'm gonna move closer,
if you don't mind.

05:38.812 --> 05:39.928
No, you don't have to go...
stay over there.

05:39.946 --> 05:40.980
How you doing, pal?

05:41.031 --> 05:42.781
- I'm Julius Pepperwood.
- Edgar.

05:42.816 --> 05:44.696
What are you doing?
If you don't mind me asking,

05:44.701 --> 05:46.151
why are you late
today, Edgar?

05:46.202 --> 05:48.320
Uh, traffic, it
really killed me.

05:48.371 --> 05:50.406
- It killed you?
- Mr. Pepperwood.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.457
Would you say that
it stabbed you?

05:52.191 --> 05:53.242
Say that again?

05:53.276 --> 05:54.397
How about glasses on or off?

05:54.427 --> 05:55.444
Teach, if I keep them on,

05:55.462 --> 05:57.429
- am I a bad boy?
- Hey.

05:57.464 --> 05:59.465
All right, honey,
I'll take them off.

05:59.499 --> 06:02.832
Whoa, that's a whole different
lens to see that blue dress.

06:04.619 --> 06:05.671
No.

06:05.722 --> 06:06.955
Okay, let's refocus.

06:06.973 --> 06:09.425
Um, let's talk
about the, um,

06:09.459 --> 06:11.677
four classifications
of conflict.

06:11.728 --> 06:12.961
We talked about it
last week.

06:12.979 --> 06:15.097
It's in the workbook, um...

06:15.131 --> 06:17.149
Anybody want to help me?

06:17.183 --> 06:18.150
Four classifications
of conflict?

06:18.184 --> 06:19.735
Anybody?
Anybody...

06:22.138 --> 06:24.786
So, no one has signed up for
office hours and I just want

06:24.790 --> 06:26.790
you to know that you can talk
to me about anything.

06:27.292 --> 06:29.060
<i>- Adios.</i>
- Anything at all.

06:31.263 --> 06:32.730
What are you doing?

06:32.764 --> 06:35.183
Nothing, man, you look
good in your Dockers.

06:35.234 --> 06:37.818
What? Nothing happened.
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

06:37.853 --> 06:38.936
Let it go.

06:41.138 --> 06:42.323
Whoops.

06:42.357 --> 06:44.025
- Why did you do that?
- The wind.

06:47.312 --> 06:49.247
No, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:51.365 --> 06:52.450
Is everything all right?

06:52.484 --> 06:54.535
Yeah, everything's good.
Oh, everything's fine, bro.

06:54.586 --> 06:55.670
What's happening right now?

06:55.704 --> 06:57.872
Sorry, Edgar,
um, I really

06:57.923 --> 06:59.924
loved your story.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.008
Um, I wanted
to give you

07:01.043 --> 07:02.293
some notes-- is there any time

07:02.327 --> 07:03.767
you could come in...
to office hours?

07:03.795 --> 07:05.429
Yeah, that be really cool.

07:05.464 --> 07:06.547
I'm really excited.

07:06.598 --> 07:08.216
Um, I'm available anytime, so...

07:08.267 --> 07:09.767
- I'll check my calendar.
- Yup.

07:09.801 --> 07:11.219
Can't get service around here.

07:13.939 --> 07:15.500
Wednesday I got to go
to the bird store.

07:17.409 --> 07:19.477
Uh, what about
Wednesday afternoon?

07:19.511 --> 07:21.279
He's my uncle.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.899
Hey, Winston,
I'm glad you're home.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.534
I know what my pogo is.

07:26.568 --> 07:28.569
It's that I dance kind
of like a sea snake.

07:33.992 --> 07:35.326
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.545
What are you talk...
I know this it, man.

07:37.579 --> 07:40.798
Is it that I barge
into people's showers?

07:40.832 --> 07:43.551
It's my caterpillar
eyebrows-- well, look.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.837
They're gone.

07:46.871 --> 07:49.774
Nick, you've gone way too far!
Way too far.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.275
Well, if you're here for Edgar's
notebook, you're too late.

07:51.309 --> 07:53.811
Where's the notebook?

07:53.829 --> 07:54.996
Nick!

07:55.030 --> 07:57.198
What's my one rule?

07:57.249 --> 07:58.833
It's to not steal your yarn.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.601
Don't steal my yarn, man.

08:00.636 --> 08:01.953
It's my one thing.

08:01.987 --> 08:03.821
But look at what was
inside of his notebook.

08:03.855 --> 08:05.606
Okay, he was doodling
in class, Nick.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.224
Weapons, dripping
with blood?

08:07.259 --> 08:08.659
That is not a doodle.

08:08.694 --> 08:09.977
What are you, the doodle police?

08:12.164 --> 08:14.115
- There's no doodle police, are there?
- Really?

08:14.166 --> 08:15.783
I can't believe you
still don't believe me.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.068
Jessica...

08:18.086 --> 08:19.069
Exhibit D.

08:19.087 --> 08:21.739
He did this.

08:21.757 --> 08:23.624
I'm going to Edgar's house,
I'm looking for more proof.

08:23.675 --> 08:25.075
No, Nick, you're not spying
on the one student

08:25.093 --> 08:26.460
that I have a connection with.

08:26.511 --> 08:27.832
- I have the address right here.
- No.

08:27.846 --> 08:29.580
- Give me the...
- No!

08:29.598 --> 08:31.682
- I have the address memorized.
- Fine, then I'm coming, too.

08:31.717 --> 08:35.049
To bail you out of jail when you
get arrested for trespassing.

08:35.587 --> 08:38.022
- Fine, then you'll see
that I was right. - Fine!

08:38.056 --> 08:40.975
And you'll also see
who gets there first.

08:41.025 --> 08:42.760
Maybe we should take one car.

08:42.794 --> 08:44.528
Just, like, for the environment.

08:44.563 --> 08:45.730
Yeah, that makes sense--
we can drive together.

08:45.764 --> 08:47.448
- Fine!
- Fine!

08:51.370 --> 08:52.486
It's my mole, isn't it?

08:52.537 --> 08:53.654
Well, consider it gone.

08:53.705 --> 08:55.539
Game, set, pogo.

08:55.574 --> 08:56.991
Chill out, man,
it's not your mole.

08:57.042 --> 08:58.492
Just tell me,
this is the worst.

08:58.543 --> 08:59.610
This is not the worst,
Schmidt-- the worst

08:59.628 --> 09:01.111
is actually knowing.

09:01.129 --> 09:02.446
Knowing that your friends

09:02.464 --> 09:03.664
sit around every single night

09:03.715 --> 09:05.282
talking about your pogo.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.785
What's a pogo?

09:07.803 --> 09:09.253
Those brows don't freak you out?

09:09.287 --> 09:10.554
Nah, I've seen worse.

09:10.589 --> 09:12.223
A pogo is what
your friends talk about

09:12.257 --> 09:13.341
when you leave the room.

09:13.392 --> 09:14.975
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?

09:19.731 --> 09:22.016
Uh... sh...

09:22.067 --> 09:23.234
You guys talk about my toenails?

09:23.268 --> 09:25.302
Never...

09:25.320 --> 09:28.239
talk about
your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.

09:28.273 --> 09:31.525
I know my toenails
are a little rugged.

09:31.576 --> 09:32.743
Woodsy.

09:32.778 --> 09:34.478
I mean, I have never wondered

09:34.496 --> 09:36.580
if you could shimmy up
a palm tree.

09:36.615 --> 09:39.083
But it's because I have a
keratin surplus, I mean...

09:39.117 --> 09:41.285
They're not that bad,
look at these things.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.319
- Aah! Schmidt!
- Ew!

09:42.337 --> 09:44.154
It looks like an open
Swiss Army knife.

09:44.172 --> 09:46.257
Most of them are hard, but one
of them is really, really soft.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.659
I know, I know, I know-- we'll
just talk about what my pogo is.

09:48.677 --> 09:49.677
What's my pogo?

09:50.162 --> 09:51.662
Is it the way I say "pan"?

09:51.696 --> 09:54.098
Pan, pan, pan.

09:54.132 --> 09:56.050
Look, Cece, this is more
of just a loft thing.

09:56.101 --> 09:58.002
Just thank your lucky stars
that you don't have

09:58.036 --> 09:59.053
calcified mongrel toes!

10:01.773 --> 10:03.941
Things sound like
a dang ol' crab.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.811
There it is.

10:06.845 --> 10:08.512
If anything's gonna go down,
we need a safe word.

10:08.530 --> 10:11.232
Nothing's gonna go down
unless we make it go down.

10:11.283 --> 10:13.684
- If Pepperwood taught me anything--
- There's no Pepperwood.

10:13.702 --> 10:17.021
Never get caught
without a safe word.

10:17.055 --> 10:18.622
We're gonna go with "apricot."

10:18.657 --> 10:20.023
That's way too normal.
We need to, like,

10:20.041 --> 10:22.293
go with something weird,
like "dragon slippers."

10:22.327 --> 10:24.628
- What?
- I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.

10:24.663 --> 10:27.131
Why do you use
"apricot" so much?

10:27.165 --> 10:29.333
What am I supposed to call
them-- "sweet tangy balls"?

10:29.367 --> 10:32.253
Don't call them "sweet
tangy balls," Jessica.

10:32.304 --> 10:34.037
Well, that's why
we can't use...

10:34.055 --> 10:37.388
Nick... Nick...

10:37.809 --> 10:39.093
Nick, oh!

10:40.144 --> 10:41.929
Shh! Come on...

10:41.980 --> 10:44.348
- Nick..
-  Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.183
You look ridiculous.

10:46.217 --> 10:47.852
If we're hiding
from people,

10:47.886 --> 10:49.553
- why does it matter what I call you?
- I got my eyes

10:49.571 --> 10:51.555
- and you get my six.
- No, no, what does this mean?

10:51.573 --> 10:53.524
- I'm pretty sure this...
- This means "right turn bicycle."

10:53.558 --> 10:55.025
- No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...
- " It means "right turn."

10:55.059 --> 10:57.027
Nick, seriously--
use your words.

10:57.061 --> 11:00.364
- Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.
- Okay, these are my words.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.449
Oh!

11:01.500 --> 11:02.700
Apricot, apricot,
apricot.

11:02.734 --> 11:05.235
Close your mouth,
close your eyes.

11:10.008 --> 11:11.509
Edgar lives with his mother.
Of course he does.

11:11.543 --> 11:13.344
So? A lot of normal people
live with their mothers.

11:14.378 --> 11:15.412
Like my Uncle Randy.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.548
- He can't go near parks.
- He was cleared.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.467
You've got to...

11:19.518 --> 11:20.718
Apricot! Apricot!

11:20.752 --> 11:24.085
Get over here now!

11:32.364 --> 11:33.931
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

11:36.535 --> 11:37.785
What's in that duffel bag?

11:39.371 --> 11:41.271
He's the plumber
from the story.

11:41.289 --> 11:42.873
- How did I not see this before?
- What was I saying?

11:42.908 --> 11:45.159
- Oh, my God, you were right.
- Yes, say that again,

11:45.210 --> 11:46.911
- say that again. You were right, you
were right, you were right about everything.

11:46.945 --> 11:48.996
- Don't ever forget you're saying it!
- Oh, my God,

11:49.047 --> 11:50.548
- I can't believe you were right.
- I was a right about everything!

11:50.582 --> 11:52.883
What the hell is in
that duffel bag?

11:52.918 --> 11:55.753
- I don't know.
- No, Nick.

11:55.787 --> 11:57.505
- Nick, you're gonna get us killed.
- Let's get down.

11:57.556 --> 12:00.007

12:00.058 --> 12:02.343
Shh.

12:04.796 --> 12:06.964
Oh, my... Jessica,

12:07.598 --> 12:09.963
- Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.
- What do I do?

12:09.967 --> 12:10.901
You turn it... Here.

12:11.936 --> 12:13.470
- Turn it off. I don't know
how to do this.    - Okay.

12:14.906 --> 12:16.807
Oh, my God. Get the
hell out of here.

12:24.281 --> 12:25.782
Jess, what are
you doing?

12:25.816 --> 12:27.084
That is ridiculous.
There was plenty of room.

12:27.085 --> 12:28.035
It seemed like
a good idea.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.454
Why would you
go under a van?

12:29.455 --> 12:31.005
Let's leave.

12:33.656 --> 12:35.723
Keep still...
You will not believe what just happened.

12:35.724 --> 12:37.492
- Nick was right.
- I was right.

12:37.526 --> 12:38.743
Oh, my God, what happened
to your eyebrows?

12:38.778 --> 12:40.528
You look like Audrey Hepburn.

12:40.562 --> 12:41.863
Don't we own an
industrial-size paper cutter?

12:41.897 --> 12:43.998
- Ugh!
- Oh, whatever.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.700
- What the hell is that?
- So close to the eating area!

12:45.734 --> 12:47.869
Winston told me that you guys
make fun of my gremlin toenails.

12:47.903 --> 12:51.236
That you call them "clickety-
clacks" or "centaur boots."

12:51.507 --> 12:52.874
What is wrong
with you, Winston?

12:52.908 --> 12:56.241
What <i>is</i> wrong with me?
Besides my pogo.

12:57.345 --> 12:58.946
I told him.
It just kind of popped out.

12:58.947 --> 13:00.215
You understand what
that's like, right, Winston?

13:00.249 --> 13:01.716
Okay, you know what?
Don't act like

13:01.750 --> 13:03.301
we don't talk about you two
behind your backs.

13:03.352 --> 13:05.887
Because we do. You both have
pogos, my friends.

13:05.921 --> 13:08.139
Okay, let's take a deep breath
and ask ourselves

13:08.690 --> 13:12.843
if this conversation is worth
ruining our friendships over.

13:12.844 --> 13:14.229
Tell me my pogo.

13:14.263 --> 13:15.980
I need to know my pogo.

13:16.031 --> 13:19.364
You guys need to tell me.
I can take it. Lay it on me!

13:19.434 --> 13:21.319
You know, it's kind of a loft thing.
Is it my pies?

13:21.370 --> 13:22.821
Are they too tart?

13:22.872 --> 13:24.455
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?

13:24.490 --> 13:26.457
My koala claws,
now that's a pogo!

13:26.492 --> 13:27.959
At least you can hide
your pogo in a shoe.

13:27.993 --> 13:31.496
They make shoes for your penis--
they're called pants!

13:31.547 --> 13:32.914
- Tell me my pogo.
- Jessica, no.

13:32.948 --> 13:35.383
- Tell me my pogo!
- You're a know-it-all!

13:35.417 --> 13:36.634
- Huge know-it-all.
- The worst.

13:36.669 --> 13:39.554
Oh, I'm the worst
know-it-all in the world?

13:39.588 --> 13:42.921
Please. Hate hyperbolic
speak. Please.

13:43.108 --> 13:45.693
Now you know your pogo,
you truly know it all.

13:45.727 --> 13:47.111
There I go
being a smart-ass again.

13:47.162 --> 13:48.913
I mean, that, that
could be my pogo.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.532
And then there was one.

13:50.566 --> 13:52.617
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure
that you guys have stuff

13:52.668 --> 13:54.419
you laugh at me
behind my back.

13:54.453 --> 13:55.753
We don't laugh about
your pogo, Nick.

13:55.788 --> 13:57.905
Yeah. We're worried about you.

13:57.923 --> 13:59.390
You're worried about me?

13:59.425 --> 14:00.708
We're worried that you're
not gonna make it.

14:00.742 --> 14:03.044
- Make it to what?
- Just in general.

14:03.078 --> 14:04.078
'Cause you don't take
care of yourself.

14:04.096 --> 14:05.046
Sometimes I'll crumple up
vitamins

14:05.080 --> 14:06.548

money into your pants pockets

14:09.134 --> 14:11.436

in the dryer.

14:11.470 --> 14:13.555
Yeah? Well,
I hope you're happy.

14:13.589 --> 14:14.806

14:15.387 --> 14:18.190

is ruined.

17:08.864 --> 17:12.196
What's more surprising than
killing your main character?

17:12.851 --> 17:15.784
What about this--
go with me-- what if, um,

17:16.371 --> 17:20.404
what if my character lives
and the book just goes on?

17:21.159 --> 17:23.744
Imagine coming to the end
of the book,

17:23.779 --> 17:26.329
and then just finding
a lot more book.

17:27.215 --> 17:29.934
Surprise.

17:29.968 --> 17:32.420
- ♪ I'm so excited
- Um, oh.

17:32.454 --> 17:34.789
- ♪ And I just can't hide it...
- I heard that song yesterday.

17:34.807 --> 17:35.790
This song is everywhere
these days.

17:35.808 --> 17:37.475
Were you at my house?

17:37.509 --> 17:39.594
- Okay, thank you. Good-bye.
- No.

17:39.628 --> 17:41.929
- No! No!
- I have to go... right now.

17:41.963 --> 17:43.347
Apricot's leaving!
Apricot's leaving!

17:43.398 --> 17:45.849
Oh, good.
I'm so happy you're alive.

17:45.850 --> 17:47.685
Okay, stay inside
and lock the door.

17:47.736 --> 17:51.022
I am coming. I am going
to protect you...

17:51.073 --> 17:52.240
Nick?! Pepperwood! Nick!?

17:56.990 --> 17:58.976
Burglar?! He's not a burglar.

17:59.177 --> 18:01.528
He's Julius Pepperwood
from Chicago.

18:01.562 --> 18:02.846
Let's get him
in the house.

18:02.847 --> 18:04.865
The D.A.'s gonna have my badge
for this.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.266
No! Get off of him!

18:06.684 --> 18:09.617
You kill him, you kill me, too!

18:09.704 --> 18:11.154
Get away from my Edgar!

18:14.626 --> 18:16.326
My eyes! Oh!

18:16.377 --> 18:19.002
My giant eyes!

18:19.003 --> 18:20.313
You thought I was
a murderer?

18:20.382 --> 18:22.166
You thought I was a
murderer of people?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.418
You said you were gonna
kill me, so I don't know.

18:24.469 --> 18:27.204
Your character...
in my graphic novel.

18:27.222 --> 18:28.922
- He's an excellent artist.
- Okay, but your drawings,

18:28.973 --> 18:30.808
they don't have any eyes.

18:31.092 --> 18:33.210
- Hate drawing eyes. It's weird.
- He can't draw eyes.

18:33.228 --> 18:34.711
There's a reason for everything.

18:34.729 --> 18:35.929
What about the duffel bag?

18:35.980 --> 18:37.347
Don't ask about the duffel bag!

18:37.881 --> 18:38.515
Bitch.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.217
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa! Hey, man.

18:40.235 --> 18:41.885
Hey, take this
as a compliment, pal.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.604
Your stories are so real.

18:44.155 --> 18:46.156
Well, it's because
what you taught me.

18:48.191 --> 18:49.276
You listened?

18:49.327 --> 18:51.812
Well, of course I listened.
You were a good teacher.

18:52.846 --> 18:55.115
Until you thought I was a murderer
and you broke into my shed.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.618
Aw! You were my favorite
student until

18:57.669 --> 18:59.503
I thought you were
a murderer.

18:59.537 --> 19:02.506
- Ah...
- Your son's a really great writer.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.373
- He's not my son.
- Oh! Are you kidding?!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.373
Really?!

19:08.378 --> 19:09.412
Real nice, you two.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.381
Come here, baby.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.618
Mm! God, you smell
like waffles.

19:15.352 --> 19:17.004
I love it. Did you just
make some waffles?

19:17.038 --> 19:19.022
- Want to eat me up?
- Yes, I do.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.358
I'll meet you inside.
I'm gonna get the duffel bag.

19:21.376 --> 19:23.377
- Yes, do.
- Okay.

19:26.414 --> 19:27.381
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

19:27.415 --> 19:28.532
What are you doing up?

19:28.550 --> 19:29.883
Just taking care of myself.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.252
Are you putting butter on bacon?

19:32.303 --> 19:33.703
I don't want it
to stick to the pan.

19:33.721 --> 19:36.590
Okay, did you...?

19:38.542 --> 19:39.393
Great.

19:39.927 --> 19:41.395
It's just what bacon needs,

19:41.929 --> 19:43.647
more fat.

19:44.181 --> 19:45.566
And salt.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.401
- What's this?
- Don't read that. I'm not finished...

19:47.435 --> 19:50.768
"Julius Pepperwood:
Zombie Detective"?

19:50.855 --> 19:52.656
All his murder victims
are already dead,

19:52.690 --> 19:55.759
so they obviously don't need
a detective. I'm working on it.

19:55.793 --> 19:58.011
- "The night was inky hot."
- Don't do this.

19:58.062 --> 20:01.298
"She strode into his office with
a sense of purpose, place,

20:01.816 --> 20:03.567
another word here,
question mark."

20:03.601 --> 20:04.968
I'm looking for another
"P" word there.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.104
"She had zombie legs
that went on for miles.

20:07.388 --> 20:10.107
"They were the kind of legs
you could sink your teeth into.

20:10.158 --> 20:13.991
"Pepperwood had two friends--
one, if you count his hat.

20:14.061 --> 20:16.894
The other was his gal Friday,
Jessica Night."

20:18.533 --> 20:20.534
It's not you, Jess.

20:20.568 --> 20:23.003
"She was small in stature,
but not in spunk.

20:23.037 --> 20:25.789
And a super annoying
know-it-all."

20:25.840 --> 20:28.341
Good evening.

20:28.376 --> 20:31.077
Hello.

20:31.095 --> 20:32.546
Oh, bacon.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.746
Where the hell
did you come from?

20:34.765 --> 20:35.682
I came from my room.

20:35.683 --> 20:38.135
No, I didn't hear the pitter-
patter of your disgusting feet.

20:38.186 --> 20:40.353
I cut my toenails.
Yeah, the soaking really worked.

20:40.388 --> 20:41.471
Look at that.
They're gorgeous now.

20:41.522 --> 20:44.090
- Went down a full shoe size.
- Guys! Fire!

20:44.108 --> 20:45.425
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

20:45.443 --> 20:47.027
Everybody relax!
Call a fireman!

20:47.061 --> 20:48.612
- You call the fireman!
- I'm the fireman.

20:49.764 --> 20:52.098
You can't put out a grease fire
with water!

20:52.116 --> 20:53.482
You have to smother it!

20:53.483 --> 20:55.417
Why didn't you say
that before?!

20:55.485 --> 20:56.385
I don't want
to be a know-it-all!

20:56.453 --> 20:58.254
- You're so stupid!
- Shut up!

20:58.321 --> 21:00.056
- Whoo! Oh!
- Nice!

21:00.124 --> 21:01.157
Yes!

21:01.224 --> 21:03.126
Amazing, my man! Whoa.
Whoa.

21:03.193 --> 21:04.761
Honestly, I didn't know you were
gonna put your arm around me.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.963
I'm so sorry.

21:07.031 --> 21:09.665
Oh, you put up your pup tent
in front of the fire.

21:09.732 --> 21:11.499
It's involuntary.

21:11.567 --> 21:14.900
It is a combination
of adrenaline

21:14.971 --> 21:16.772
and great circulation.

21:16.839 --> 21:18.756
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't just hug me randomly!

21:18.757 --> 21:20.275
That's weird and...!

21:22.545 --> 21:25.345
You ever notice...
when Winston runs,

21:25.413 --> 21:27.882
- that he kinda farts while
he's running?      - Yes!

21:29.084 --> 21:30.350
- Sounds like a jalopy.
- New pogo.

21:30.418 --> 21:32.586
Oh, we got a great
new pogo!

21:33.154 --> 21:34.614
He farts when he runs!
