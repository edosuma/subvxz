00:51.384 --> 00:57.347
The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind

00:58.725 --> 01:01.226
You spit as you slammed out the door

01:03.980 --> 01:09.318
If this is love we're crazy
We fight like cats and dogs

01:10.653 --> 01:14.114
But I just know there's got to be more

01:19.496 --> 01:25.667
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

01:26.169 --> 01:29.088
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

01:31.716 --> 01:34.802
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

01:34.844 --> 01:38.222
Everyone's a bit insane

01:40.600 --> 01:44.394
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

01:44.687 --> 01:47.481
Out walking in the rain

02:04.499 --> 02:10.211
I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint

02:11.297 --> 02:14.716
I'm selfish and I'm cruel
But you're blind

02:17.095 --> 02:22.724
If I exorcise my devils
Well, my angels may leave too

02:23.852 --> 02:27.729
When they leave they're so hard to find

02:32.735 --> 02:38.740
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

02:39.450 --> 02:42.536
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

02:44.789 --> 02:47.958
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

02:48.042 --> 02:50.836
Everyone's a bit insane

02:53.673 --> 02:57.426
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

02:57.468 --> 03:00.137
Out walking in the rain

03:08.605 --> 03:11.607
Answer me honestly.

03:12.692 --> 03:17.821
If I was to tell you that I love you
and that I'd throw it all away

03:17.906 --> 03:21.491
to be with you, what would you say?

03:22.577 --> 03:23.827
Goodnight, Paulie.

03:27.999 --> 03:32.878
Yup. Yup, that's about par
for the evening.

03:33.129 --> 03:39.885
But what I wanna see
Is the way things used to be

03:41.221 --> 03:48.018
Between you and me
The way things used to be...

03:52.065 --> 03:54.775
Let me guess.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.654
Your old lady got fed up
'cause you're chasing skirt,

03:58.738 --> 04:01.907
so she took these little ones
and left you.

04:01.991 --> 04:05.953
It's a little more complicated than that.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.456
It always is. Everybody thinks
their story has a twist.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.166
But in my experience...

04:12.877 --> 04:15.170
- Holy shit.
- Exactly.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.547
This I've got to hear.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.260
It's a long story,
and I know you're very busy...

04:21.344 --> 04:26.056
- I don't really feel like...
- Wait, wait. No, no, please.

04:34.857 --> 04:40.862
Okay, now tell me, Father, how long
has it been since your last drink?

04:42.365 --> 04:45.826
It's been about a minute
and a half since my last drink.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.997
Now, what about these kids?

04:50.164 --> 04:55.794
Okay. Well, you see the one
on the right?

04:56.129 --> 04:59.214
The cute one? That's me.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.052
- Very cute.
- Brian Finn.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.929
Paulie Chopra.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.851
This kid on the left
was my best friend, Jake.

05:11.019 --> 05:17.274
- He's a priest, too?
- Jake? No. In fact, he's a rabbi.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.611
C'mon. A priest and a rabbi?
I've heard this one.

05:21.696 --> 05:26.158
I've heard all of those. Trust me,
you have not heard this one.

05:26.242 --> 05:31.913
Okay? So there's this priest
and this rabbi, and they're best friends.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.876
But before they were a priest
and a rabbi,

05:36.085 --> 05:37.252
they both knew this girl.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.214
The girl.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.092
- Who's the girl?
- That's Anna Reilly.

05:44.135 --> 05:48.263
Reilly? Let me guess,
she became a nun?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.057
Not quite. Not quite...

05:52.143 --> 05:56.104
We all met in 6th grade at PS 84,
right here in Manhattan.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.612
I think I already knew Jake,
then we both met Anna.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.449
Actually, I remember exactly
how we met, 'cause...

06:07.492 --> 06:10.118
Well, it was a defining moment.

06:13.289 --> 06:16.458
After that,
we were pretty much inseparable.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.427
Jake and I were
what you'd call "late bloomers,"

06:27.470 --> 06:32.099
and a 7th grade girl's attentions
can be fickle, but not Anna.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.267
Her loyalty to us was constant.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.646
Anna was the friend
every 13-year-old boy dreams of.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.774
That magical cross
between Jonny Quest

06:40.817 --> 06:43.402
and Tatum O'Neal in Foxes.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.837
We were some trio. Anna called us
"Two Micks and a Yid."

07:01.921 --> 07:03.463
She was gonna make T-shirts.

07:04.632 --> 07:08.427
There's 8 million people in New York,
but when we were together,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.720
it felt like we lived on our own island.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.016
But New York is an island.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.938
I'm trying to sprinkle a little
fairy dust here, to tell a story!

07:20.022 --> 07:24.776
I'm terribly sorry. Continue.
Go on, sprinkle away.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.447
Well, then disaster struck.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.992
The summer after 8th grade,
Anna's father got a job in California,

07:32.034 --> 07:34.995
and just like that, she was gone.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.590
As for me and Jake,
our friendship just got stronger.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.176
We were like most kids in New York,

07:49.802 --> 07:52.929
but there was one unusual component:

07:53.014 --> 07:55.724
We were fascinated
with each other's religions.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.435
He showed me
the secret rituals of Judaism,

07:59.854 --> 08:01.730
and I revealed
the Catholic mysteries.

08:01.772 --> 08:06.568
Just remember:
Spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet.

08:16.037 --> 08:20.582
What makes two kids want to be
a priest and a rabbi nowadays?

08:20.625 --> 08:23.668
People don't talk much
about a calling anymore,

08:23.753 --> 08:25.962
but I knew it was what
I was supposed to do.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.299
Even then, people felt good
bringing their problems to me.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.929
My parents had given up
on children before me,

08:34.013 --> 08:36.389
so my mother called me
her "gift from God."

08:36.724 --> 08:41.352
That stuck with me, so at eight I told
her I felt I had to return the favor.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.438
She was so happy, she cried.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.441
My dad just wanted to know
if working for God came with dental.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.280
Jake's sense of a calling
didn't gel as early as mine.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.451
Religion was more of a hobby for him.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.286
Got it, got it,

08:58.621 --> 09:04.292
need it, need it,
got it, got it, need it, got it.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.883
Jake was one of those special kids.
Smart, popular.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.886
Everything came easy to him.
He had an aura.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.183
You took one look at him, and you
knew he could do anything in life.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.479
Jake's family had been in investment
banking for three generations.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.483
His father and brother Ethan
wanted him to join the family firm.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.361
I think he considered it,

09:31.445 --> 09:34.739
but he wanted to do
something different with his life.

09:35.157 --> 09:39.160
He made his decision to become
a rabbi with confidence and resolve.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.079
I don't wanna listen to you!

09:41.372 --> 09:45.166
We went off to seminary the way
other guys go off to the Peace Corps.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.543
It was an adventure.

09:49.171 --> 09:53.717
Newly ordained, we were both
assigned back to New York City,

09:53.843 --> 09:56.386
where we quickly confronted
the practical aspects of our jobs.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.707
Jesus!

10:34.842 --> 10:38.011
Despite these setbacks,
we found our groove.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.057
Take it nice and easy.
Win them over slowly, okay?

10:43.559 --> 10:45.143
Shabbat shalom, everyone!

10:45.394 --> 10:47.395
I want you to do me a favor.

10:47.563 --> 10:51.358
I want everybody in the back
to come and fill up the front rows.

10:52.234 --> 10:56.112
Guys, come on! Let's try again.
Shabbat shalom!

10:56.197 --> 10:59.074
- Shabbat shalom!
- Thank you, Mom.

10:59.158 --> 11:03.912
Ma'am, you in the back, come on!
God hates a solo artist, I promise you.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.498
We're the Fugees, no Lauryn Hills.

11:06.707 --> 11:13.421
My mom was the only person here
at the level of shabbat shalom-iness

11:13.923 --> 11:15.465
that I think we can hit.

11:15.549 --> 11:20.387
Sir, you're leaving. It's customary
to sneak out after the communion.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.139
Give me something I can work with!
Shabbat shalom!

11:23.224 --> 11:26.935
- Shabbat shalom!
- All right! Now we can daven!

11:27.937 --> 11:31.564
I don't want to brag, but word
got out there was a new act in town,

11:31.607 --> 11:36.403
and soon we played to the packed
houses I knew were our destiny.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.324
I know. I know!

11:45.955 --> 11:49.165
Seriously, what is the story of Sodom
and Gomorrah really about?

11:49.333 --> 11:52.585
- Anyone? Steve Posner.
- Sexual perversion.

11:52.670 --> 11:57.090
Sexual perversion. Steve Posner's
watching too much Spice Channel.

11:57.341 --> 12:02.554
The Seven Deadly Sins. Who can
name the Seven Deadly Sins?

12:04.181 --> 12:09.644
People! It was a film with Brad Pitt.
You have the ultimate Cliff Note!

12:10.020 --> 12:14.691
And Lot takes them in and he protects
them. What happens next?

12:14.817 --> 12:18.236
Anybody? Greta Mussbaum,
before she pulls her rotator cuff.

12:19.697 --> 12:24.325
- God spares Lot and his family.
- Bingo! Two-week cruise for Greta!

12:25.077 --> 12:27.454
You're going to the Bahamas!

12:27.788 --> 12:32.083
When you think about it,
God is a lot like Blanche Du Bois.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.544
He's always relied
on the kindness of strangers.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.631
That's what the story's about,
us taking care of each other.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.801
God relies on us
to take care of each other.

12:41.844 --> 12:46.556
The truth is, I don't really learn about
your faith by asking such questions.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.518
Those aren't questions about faith,
they're about religion.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.397
It's important to understand
the difference between them,

12:54.482 --> 12:57.484
because faith is not about
having the right answers.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.030
Faith is a feeling, faith is a hunch.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.659
It's a hunch that there is
something bigger, connecting it all.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.037
Connecting us all together.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.666
And that feeling, that hunch, is God.

13:15.377 --> 13:20.840
Coming here on Sunday evening
to connect with that feeling,

13:20.883 --> 13:23.843
that is an act of faith.

13:23.886 --> 13:28.139
So all I have to do is look around
the room, at this packed church,

13:28.474 --> 13:32.393
to know that we're doing pretty well
as a community.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.106
Even if all of you failed
my pop quiz miserably.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.236
Let us pray.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.991
Jake and I wanted
to kick the dust off our faiths.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.703
Bring them up to speed,
no more old routines.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.957
Jake said, "We'll give them an
Old World God with a New Age spin."

13:57.920 --> 13:59.045
Feel the prana!

13:59.088 --> 14:01.464
We decided to turn
an abandoned disco

14:01.549 --> 14:05.969
into a joint Catholic-Jewish
senior center/karaoke lounge.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.264
A Fiddler on the Roof meets
Lord of the Dance

14:09.306 --> 14:12.100
meets Buena Vista Social Club.

14:12.184 --> 14:17.021
Not an easy idea to sell,
but we wanted to push the envelope.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.650
We would bring our religions
into the 21 st century.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.986
We were gonna shove them a little,
if we had to.

14:24.321 --> 14:28.283
Jake said we'd be like young cops
shaking up the force.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.326
You know. The God Squad.

14:39.336 --> 14:43.381
Well, it's just like the ocean
under the moon

14:43.465 --> 14:47.802
Well, that's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

14:47.887 --> 14:52.181
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

14:52.266 --> 14:56.269
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

15:04.987 --> 15:06.321
I'll ring it.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.656
Nice.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.994
Ben Lewis comes into my office
this morning, tells me he's retiring.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.622
- Rabbi Lewis?
- Yeah.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.918
- The end of an era.
- I know!

15:20.002 --> 15:22.683
That's exciting. How long until
they give it over to you officially?

15:23.172 --> 15:28.968
There are a few backward thinkers
on that board who don't get what I do.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.471
Plus, there's the fact that I'm single.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.518
- Single?
- Don't think that's not an issue.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.605
Wait a minute. Are you serious?

15:40.689 --> 15:44.943
If you don't find a nice Jewish girl soon,
you won't get the job?

15:45.027 --> 15:49.238
I'm telling you, B'Nai Ezra
hasn't had a bachelor head rabbi

15:49.323 --> 15:52.241
since the beginning of the synagogue.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.620
I mean, you better start
getting out there more.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.165
It's embarrassing.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.168
Forget that.
You want to meet somebody, right?

16:02.503 --> 16:07.215
I just want to meet somebody
in a spontaneous and casual manner.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.051
- And it's impossible with me.
- Why?

16:10.302 --> 16:14.389
- Because I'm a rabbi!
- Yes, yes. What's your point?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.558
I don't know if a woman
goes out with me for me,

16:17.643 --> 16:20.979
or because I'm Rabbi Jake, you know?

16:21.188 --> 16:24.691
There's an expectation,
I can't go with my impulses...

16:25.025 --> 16:28.653
Jews want rabbis to be the kind of
Jews they don't have the time to be.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.865
And Catholics want priests
to have the discipline they don't have.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.410
- We knew this.
- You're right.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.747
Oh, no, man, check this out.
God Squad in the house!

16:40.082 --> 16:43.376
- Hi, Shabazz.
- You gonna give it up, Rabbi?

16:43.544 --> 16:47.046
Say your prayers,
because I am in no mood today.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.923
Watch your ass, Shabazz!

16:51.635 --> 16:55.930
Turn me loose
Let's turn it up

16:58.100 --> 17:01.227
Power to the people y'all
Turn me loose

17:01.687 --> 17:02.729
Hey!

17:08.736 --> 17:12.238
- Bye. See you guys.
- Tell your mother I said hi.

17:20.580 --> 17:25.792
I've gotta quit playing the guys from
Jewish seminary, it lowers the bar.

17:27.253 --> 17:31.507
- Can I just say oy?
- Amen to your oy.

17:32.509 --> 17:36.262
- What happened to our youth?
- It ended at 30.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.515
Speaking of our youth,
I forgot to tell you.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.518
- This is big. Guess who called me?
- Who?

17:43.103 --> 17:47.231
Who is the coolest woman
you and I have ever known, ever?

17:49.526 --> 17:53.321
- That's easy. Anna Reilly, 8th grade.
- You got it.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.865
- What? She called you?
- Yeah!

17:55.949 --> 17:57.989
- Anna Reilly called you?
- Totally out of the blue.

17:57.993 --> 17:58.993
Why?

17:59.119 --> 18:03.498
She's coming to New York for work,
and she wants to get together.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.542
Really? What is she doing now?

18:06.627 --> 18:11.422
She's analyzing synergies
or synergizing analogies.

18:11.507 --> 18:16.135
I couldn't follow it,
she's a very high-powered business...

18:16.261 --> 18:18.262
- Woman?
- Yes, thank you.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.891
- You told her about us?
- Yeah, she flipped.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.685
She laughed for ten minutes,
but she was excited.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.356
- Man, that is so cool!
- I know.

18:28.690 --> 18:33.444
- I wonder why she called you?
- What do you mean?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.572
No, I mean, she called you.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.369
- Are you in the 8th grade still?
- It's a legitimate question.

18:41.411 --> 18:45.456
- I mean, we're both listed.
- Finn before Schram, okay?

18:45.541 --> 18:50.294
- You're ridiculous.
- That's a good point. Alphabetical.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.099
- Let's toss this, we look like idiots.
- Shut up, we do not!

19:03.183 --> 19:04.267
You shut up.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.768
Think she's changed?

19:06.353 --> 19:10.231
No, I bet she still weighs 88 pounds
and listens to Leif Garrett.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.152
For the record, it's Leif, long A.
Didn't you see Behind the Music?

19:15.070 --> 19:17.280
Admit it, you're excited.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.408
The three of us together again.
I can't believe it!

19:24.037 --> 19:25.413
- Is that her?
- No.

19:32.004 --> 19:36.883
- Hail Mary... full of something.
- Mary, full of...

19:40.429 --> 19:42.263
Hello, boys!

19:44.516 --> 19:48.728
- I don't understand.
- I'm like a plumber, I fix leaky firms.

19:49.104 --> 19:52.982
Jake Schram. How are you?

19:53.066 --> 19:56.319
Who are you? Tell me everything.
Give me the 411.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.822
- Job, girls, news...
- Come on, I know him.

19:59.948 --> 20:04.076
- You start, catch us up.
- All right. Job is good. Really good.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.581
My parents are happy
and retired, and I take yoga.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.625
- Men?
- That's my life.

20:10.792 --> 20:15.546
- Come on, don't cheat us.
- I don't have time for relationships.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.258
I work like 100 hours a week,
you guys have no idea.

20:19.301 --> 20:23.804
- Excuse me, we work pretty hard for...
- Yeah, working for the...

20:24.306 --> 20:27.975
- That's a full-time thing.
- No, I work harder than God.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.646
If he'd hired me, he'd have made
the world by Thursday.

20:31.688 --> 20:37.318
- So you're saying we won't see you?
- No, for you guys, I will make time.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.904
- I feel special.
- That's my bag.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.406
- I got it.
- I got it.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.450
- I got it!
- I got it. Give it to me.

20:44.493 --> 20:49.038
- Okay, thanks. You okay?
- Yep, no, go.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.750
Remember the names
of the kids from school?

20:52.834 --> 20:55.878
- Remember Aram Salaam?
- His father was a diplomat.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.173
He said he had diplomatic immunity.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.842
- Elan Portnoy?
- He always complained.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.844
He was always smoking pot.

21:16.858 --> 21:20.903
- Remember our shoplifting club?
- You had to steal to be a member.

21:22.197 --> 21:26.242
You stuck that basketball under
your shirt and said you were pregnant.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.869
- I pulled it off.
- You were 12.

21:29.162 --> 21:32.915
It was New York in the '80s,
you could get away with anything.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.418
- We should get home.
- Yeah, it's late.

21:35.502 --> 21:39.672
I'm still on West Coast time.
It's 8:00 for me. Let's do something.

21:44.386 --> 21:48.431
So, this is a rectory.
Sounds like a dirty word. Rectory.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.224
- Great place to meet chicks.
- Totally.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.519
I'll bet. So, what's your chick situation?

21:54.938 --> 21:58.149
- Don't ask, it's not a good story.
- Why?

21:58.358 --> 22:02.320
His congregation wants to set him up,
it makes him uncomfortable.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.698
- Why?
- Pandas don't mate in captivity.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.326
What does that mean?

22:08.410 --> 22:11.203
All these mothers make dates
for me that I can't refuse.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.748
They're intimidating.
They're like the Kosher Nostra.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.752
It's true. They're little women,
but very determined.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.920
You're being melodramatic.

22:20.005 --> 22:24.925
Oh, yeah? Check this out. I was faxed
one of their daughter's résumés.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.554
- Let me see that. Ali Decker.
- Look at the bottom.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.849
- Oh, she has a skills section.
- Yes?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.643
You win. She put jogging as a skill.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.646
She can't even differentiate
between a hobby and a skill.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.900
- Maybe she's a skilled jogger.
- I have to date this girl!

22:40.942 --> 22:43.611
- Why don't I say no?
- Why don't you?

22:43.695 --> 22:47.198
I can't alienate them,
I need body count at the temple.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.575
Just relax. It'll be fine.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.789
Oh, God, please let this be painless.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.749
- Hi!
- Hi!

22:56.792 --> 22:59.585
Right on time. I like that in a rabbi.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.800
- Hey, this is a great place.
- My lair.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.302
- Really nice.
- Be ready in a second.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.431
- A lot of space.
- I know. "Thanks, Daddy," right?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.060
You go, girl!

23:18.814 --> 23:21.315
No pain, no gain!

23:22.484 --> 23:26.320
Oh, Tuesdays with Morrie.
I love that book.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.207
I'm ready.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.877
- You do these tapes?
- Are you kidding me?

23:41.962 --> 23:44.213
- No.
- Are you kidding me?

23:44.339 --> 23:47.925
- No.
- Exercise is like a religion to me.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.137
No pun intended. Feel my abs!

23:52.013 --> 23:54.223
- Not bad, right?
- Ouch!

23:54.516 --> 23:56.225
- Punch me.
- Excuse me?

23:56.309 --> 23:59.395
- You heard me.
- I'm not gonna punch you.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.274
You'll find, Rabbi,
that this princess is no pushover.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.193
I can tell. Call me Jake, all right?

24:07.112 --> 24:10.114
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here, Jake.

24:10.532 --> 24:16.078
One, I like you a lot, and unless
I'm wrong, I think you like me.

24:16.830 --> 24:20.291
- Well, we just met...
- Two, I am many things.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.628
No one thing defines me.
Are we clear about that, Jake?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.673
- Yes.
- Then let me have it!

24:27.799 --> 24:31.260
- I'm not gonna punch you.
- Punch me. Hit me!

24:31.344 --> 24:34.180
- I can take it, I'm not scared.
- I know you're not.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.515
- Are you a wuss?
- I'm not a wuss.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.309
- Little wuss, little wuss...
- All right!

24:40.979 --> 24:44.398
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

24:44.483 --> 24:49.737
- Just get my bag.
- Okay. You said you could take it...

24:50.530 --> 24:54.116
- That headband's wonderful.
- I'm glad you noticed.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.536
- What is that?
- It was beaded by the mentally retarded.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.248
- It looks really good.
- They're heavily supervised.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.752
- But it really seems to...
- It goes together well.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.756
- No, that's all...
- Get away from the table!

25:08.798 --> 25:14.595
No, no! That's okay.
Here, don't! Here, thank you.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.057
You're flushing it down the toilet!
He'll spend it on booze.

25:25.607 --> 25:29.818
I had a great time.
Thank you, it was wonderful.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.618
- Goodnight.
- Don't you want to come up?

25:37.661 --> 25:42.665
- I shouldn't...
- Believe me, you should.

25:42.749 --> 25:47.962
No, I can't.
You're a congregant, and you know...

25:48.088 --> 25:51.632
I'm telling you, you can. I want you to.

25:52.801 --> 25:58.556
I... I would love to, I just... I got a...
I have a friend at home.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.559
- A friend?
- A male friend. A guy.

26:02.727 --> 26:08.190
A dog. A male dog.
A beautiful puppy named Pinkus.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.234
- Pinkus can wait.
- No, he's a Rottweiler.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.652
Just come up for a minute.

26:11.695 --> 26:17.157
No, don't! No, listen to me,
this dog is a co-dependent puppy,

26:17.200 --> 26:20.327
he needs my help or he goes
to the bathroom over everything.

26:20.870 --> 26:24.373
- Well, send me the cleaning bill. Go.
- No, don't go, stay.

26:24.457 --> 26:28.502
- You are making me crazy, Rabbi!
- You're making me so...

26:28.545 --> 26:31.338
- Just come up for a minute!
- No. No.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.173
- I can't!
- Just come on!

26:34.426 --> 26:37.177
Are you okay? Good!

26:37.262 --> 26:41.849
Go, go! Thanks, I had
a wonderful time! See you in shul!

27:24.142 --> 27:27.645
Are you playing games with me, Phil?
Are you sure?

27:27.729 --> 27:30.314
Because you know
better than that, right?

27:30.982 --> 27:35.903
Okay. If those results are correct,
then I say we have a deal.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.238
I'll expect it in writing
by the end of the day.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.912
Yes, by the end of the day, Phil.
Did I stutter?

27:45.205 --> 27:47.456
Phil, I don't have time for this, okay?

27:47.791 --> 27:51.043
Gotta go, Phil. Gotta go.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.047
No way.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.427
Oh, yeah, baby.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.614
Okay, it's okay. Take a break.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.617
I suck. They'll take away my yarmulke.

28:23.952 --> 28:27.121
- You don't suck.
- I suck.

28:27.622 --> 28:33.293
Okay, yes, you do suck. But that's okay,
you're supposed to suck.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.422
This isn't a talent contest,
it's a rite of passage.

28:36.464 --> 28:40.426
This happens in all cultures,
it's about you being 13.

28:40.510 --> 28:45.597
God knows your voice changes,
that's why you do your haftorah now.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.765
It's a challenge.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.768
God is challenging you.
He's calling you a chump!

28:49.811 --> 28:52.646
You gotta come back at him!
Say, "Hey, hashem",

28:52.689 --> 28:58.068
"you think you can scare me
'cause my balls haven't dropped yet?"

28:58.319 --> 29:01.447
I'm serious! You gotta show him
what Alan Klein's made of!

29:01.656 --> 29:06.243
- How?
- By sucking with style! Embrace it!

29:06.745 --> 29:09.913
- Say, "I love that I suck."
- I love that I suck.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.958
Good! But own it.
Say it, "I love that I suck!"

29:13.001 --> 29:16.295
I love that I suck!

29:16.337 --> 29:17.504
Good. You play.

29:17.714 --> 29:21.675
- I love that I suck.
- Keep going with that.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.886
I'll see you next week. Hello?

29:24.095 --> 29:27.431
- Hello?
- You suck! Hey, Anna?

29:27.682 --> 29:30.017
I thought I got the Tony Robbins hotline.

29:30.059 --> 29:33.812
- Sorry, just finishing up. How are you?
- How was the big date?

29:34.147 --> 29:38.609
That's funny. I had an impulse to call
you, but I thought it was too late.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.361
You should have, I was stuck here.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.615
- Really?
- So, how'd it go?

29:45.867 --> 29:50.204
Mostly horrible, with a few brief
moments of excruciating agony.

29:50.246 --> 29:53.832
- But at least it was long.
- I'm so sorry. What a waste.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.293
People should have to qualify
to go out with you.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.629
You're too precious
to be on the open market.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.548
- That's what I tell them.
- They should listen to you.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.220
- If only you were Jewish.
- Well, nobody's perfect.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.391
- So, what did you wear?
- What?

30:12.852 --> 30:15.312
I'm not telling you what I wore.
Why should I?

30:15.396 --> 30:19.733
I want an image of a young rabbi
on the prowl. What's your game?

30:19.901 --> 30:25.197
- All right. Blue button-down shirt.
- A good color for your eyes.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.032
Blue pinstripe suit.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.994
I can picture that.
Tasteful, yet with a quiet power.

30:31.287 --> 30:35.207
- That's me. Chic, with a quiet power.
- Shoes?

30:35.834 --> 30:40.128
- Black. Kenneth Cole. Leather.
- Size?

30:41.798 --> 30:44.091
Big.

30:44.384 --> 30:49.137
- Wanna hear about my tie?
- Baby, no. Save room for dessert.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.434
- Don't give up hope.
- I'll keep it alive.

30:54.769 --> 30:58.647
- Goodbye, Mr. Sharp-Dressed Man.
- Bye-bye.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.079
Oh, nice!

31:25.800 --> 31:30.262
I have a friend here
I thought you might want to see.

31:31.389 --> 31:36.351
Will you please turn
to page 508 for Ein Keloheinu.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.146
Sorry, Raphae, hang on a second.

31:39.272 --> 31:44.276
I have to say this first because
it's really been bothering me.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.363
Ein Keloheinu. It's a joyous song.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.533
It's a prayer about praising the Lord,

31:51.701 --> 31:55.579
telling the Lord
how much we love Him, or Her.

31:55.663 --> 31:59.750
But no matter what I do,
you don't sing it with any feeling.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.335
I mean, I brought in the band.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.673
That didn't work.
I brought in my bongos last week.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.051
I think we can all agree
that was a backwards step.

32:11.930 --> 32:16.183
So, this morning,
I'm bringing in a little outside help.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.268
Maury, if you would!

32:30.073 --> 32:32.908
You can even sing along. Come on!

32:33.076 --> 32:34.534
Have a little fun with it!

32:39.582 --> 32:42.834
That's right. Get up! Get those butts
out of the chairs. Come on!

32:46.381 --> 32:48.048
Up in the cheap seats!

32:49.300 --> 32:52.260
I can't hear you up there. Sing it out!

32:54.138 --> 32:55.847
Over 70!

32:56.849 --> 32:59.017
Come on, all the young Jews!

33:10.780 --> 33:14.700
- You were wonderful!
- Rabbi! Rabbi!

33:27.922 --> 33:31.842
This is astonishing!
This is a house of worship!

33:31.926 --> 33:33.635
If my grandfather had seen this...

33:34.012 --> 33:37.931
This is my daughter Ruthie.
She's going to be a physiotherapist.

33:39.642 --> 33:43.395
Rabbi, you're so wonderful.
You know my daughter Hillary.

33:52.989 --> 33:56.700
Jake, Bonnie Rose.
Have you met my daughter Rachel?

33:56.784 --> 33:59.286
- Hi, Jake.
- Oh, hi!

33:59.328 --> 34:01.663
We don't often get celebrities here.

34:01.748 --> 34:06.334
Once when I was young,
Bella Abzug showed up for a bris...

34:06.961 --> 34:11.465
I've heard so much about you.
The service was wonderful.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.717
You were really, really wonderful.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.889
- We're all aware of your success.
- She's now in network prime time.

34:18.973 --> 34:22.768
- Look, we get on a live feed.
- My mom does all my PR.

34:22.810 --> 34:26.813
- I know what you mean. Mine, too.
- No, my mother's firm does my PR.

34:26.856 --> 34:30.525
I'm at PMK.
We got her special correspondent.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.610
Great!

34:31.652 --> 34:34.821
- She just interviewed Arafat.
- Yasser?

34:35.114 --> 34:37.657
- In Arabic.
- That's great, I didn't know.

34:37.742 --> 34:41.995
What you don't know is a lot.
You two should get together.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.873
- Sure.
- I'm free on Thursday.

34:44.956 --> 34:48.668
- Thursday, that's great.
- Okay.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.212
Great. Nice to see you, Bonnie.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.261
This is the man you told me about.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.264
I appreciate what you did
for us in the war...

35:04.393 --> 35:07.854
- How upset are they?
- They're less than thrilled.

35:08.439 --> 35:12.317
- We're less than thrilled.
- With what, specifically?

35:12.360 --> 35:16.822
With what, specifically?
With guided meditation, specifically.

35:17.198 --> 35:23.203
With stand-up comedy sermons,
and your loose improvisational style.

35:23.329 --> 35:27.666
With people enjoying services,
people showing up at all?

35:27.708 --> 35:30.544
To be serenaded
by the Harlem Gospel Choir?

35:30.586 --> 35:34.047
- At least they were praying!
- It was a hell of an Ein Keloheinu.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.716
- It's not kosher!
- What does that mean?

35:36.801 --> 35:39.386
What's kosher? Study your gemara.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.472
Do you feel the same way?

35:42.557 --> 35:46.184
It's not your ideas.
Your ideas are very good.

35:46.227 --> 35:49.020
You're just a little aggressive...

35:49.063 --> 35:54.192
- But, Ben, come on! It was working!
- I know, I know.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.863
- You shake things up. That's good.
- When it works.

35:57.905 --> 36:03.451
But appreciate that many people
come here for a sense of continuity.

36:03.744 --> 36:07.706
It's not just the board.
It's your congregation, Jake.

36:08.040 --> 36:12.586
Mrs. Katz likes to sing
Ein Keloheinu the way she knows it.

36:12.670 --> 36:16.756
Tradition is not old habit.
It's comforting to people.

36:16.799 --> 36:19.634
I'm not interested
in babysitting Mrs. Katz.

36:19.719 --> 36:23.388
I want to push people to grow.
Otherwise, what are we doing?

36:23.431 --> 36:27.601
I know, but you have
to be patient with them.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.353
You'll find people go a lot farther

36:30.438 --> 36:34.774
if they feel they're being led
and not pushed!

36:36.777 --> 36:39.779
Good for you, Anna.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.741
No more of this
"woman behind the man" shit.

36:42.783 --> 36:46.119
Most men are unworthy
of the opportunities they've had.

36:46.287 --> 36:49.080
As a woman on your own,
trying to succeed,

36:49.123 --> 36:52.834
what do you do
with that victory energy each day?

36:52.919 --> 36:55.045
Don't you want to share it?

36:55.129 --> 36:58.465
Do what they do. Take lovers.
I've had more dates than Jake.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.633
Mom...

36:59.675 --> 37:04.679
It's true. And when lovers bore,
which they will, sublimate.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.850
- I take classes.
- Me, too! What's your favorite?

37:09.310 --> 37:11.353
- Kabbalah. You?
- Kick-boxing.

37:11.437 --> 37:16.816
I used to take kick-boxing, but it was
too high-impact. I take tae-bo now.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.278
- It's doubled my energy.
- I need that high impact.

37:20.321 --> 37:23.448
I know, I take
Native American drumming.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.992
You take tae-bo?

37:26.327 --> 37:28.995
Look at those pomegranates.

37:33.626 --> 37:38.505
Our-Lady's bedstraw.
The most poetic herb.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.633
Now, over to you.
Anybody new in your life?

37:41.676 --> 37:44.511
Twenty minutes.
I can't believe we got this far.

37:44.553 --> 37:48.014
It's my right to check.
What about that Shapiro girl?

37:48.099 --> 37:51.268
- Not the Shapiro girl.
- Why? She was a looker.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.396
- The problem was here.
- What? Bad skin?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.606
- No, not bad skin.
- What?

37:56.691 --> 38:01.194
You want an example? I take her out
to dinner. She doesn't want dessert.

38:01.237 --> 38:04.531
I get pecan pie.
She asks for a bite, I give it to her.

38:04.573 --> 38:09.369
Her face swells up like a chipmunk.
She says, "Are there nuts in this?"

38:09.412 --> 38:12.747
- So what?
- Mom, it was pecan pie!

38:12.832 --> 38:17.460
- There must be somebody for you.
- Come on, tell her!

38:17.545 --> 38:20.463
- He's got a very hot prospect.
- Who?

38:21.048 --> 38:24.718
Rachel Rose!
That's who I'm going out with.

38:24.760 --> 38:28.471
- ABC Rachel Rose?
- Yes, ABC Rachel Rose.

38:28.556 --> 38:32.183
I could be in-laws
with ABC Rachel Rose.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.185
Peter Jennings would be
at the wedding!

38:34.228 --> 38:39.232
Speaking of in-laws, Ethan and Jackie
took me to her mom's new play.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.568
- How is Ethan?
- He just got promoted.

38:41.610 --> 38:46.573
He's a vice-president now.
They gave him Dad's old office.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.785
How nice. I got to hear this from you.

38:51.203 --> 38:54.831
- Maybe if you called him...
- I don't want to talk about it.

38:54.957 --> 39:00.003
- Mom, he'd love to hear from you.
- Please, Jake, don't spoil this.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.798
I got you, I'm proud of you.
I got this beautiful garden.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.676
I've reconnected with this old friend.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.597
Let's just hold hands and breathe.
Together.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.977
- You're not breathing.
- I am.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.731
- I don't hear you breathing.
- I don't breathe audibly.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.206
Blam!

39:56.727 --> 40:01.689
- All right, I gotta go. I gotta go!
- Gotta go, really gotta go!

40:02.233 --> 40:04.192
Why not have that thing
implanted in your ear?

40:04.276 --> 40:06.069
I'll be top on the list.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.571
- ¿ Hola, María, cómo está?
- Beep! Beep!

40:09.240 --> 40:12.826
- Hello, young sir!
- Hello, Radio Man.

40:12.868 --> 40:16.871
- It's like I'm in The Godfather.
- I'm God's consigliere.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.998
Gotta go through me to get to Him.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.542
Children.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.898
I totally forget
how amazing New York is.

40:43.983 --> 40:48.027
I know. Whoever said it,
it was really true.

40:48.070 --> 40:51.322
New Yorkers understand
people living elsewhere

40:51.365 --> 40:53.491
must be, in some sense, kidding.

41:01.542 --> 41:05.420
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, obviously, anything.

41:05.504 --> 41:07.213
It's personal, so...

41:08.757 --> 41:12.760
- Are we gonna have the sex talk?
- Yes!

41:12.887 --> 41:15.930
- I want to know how this works for you.
- It's fine. Fire away.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.766
- Really?
- Yeah, I know you got a list.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.018
Okay.

41:21.395 --> 41:25.148
- Well, you don't, right?
- No.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.358
- At all?
- At all.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.777
So, have you ever...

41:31.655 --> 41:33.907
- Yes!
- Had sex? Yes.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.034
- With women?
- Yes.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.244
- So, you're not gay.
- No.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.913
- Sure?
- Yes.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.416
But even if I was,
the rules are the same.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.461
- Do you miss it?
- No.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.046
- Are you tempted?
- No.

41:48.088 --> 41:51.716
- You'd love it if the rule changed.
- I don't think about it.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.177
- Do you fantasize?
- Not really.

41:54.261 --> 41:57.514
How is that possible?
I've seen how women look at you.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.933
Especially knowing you're a priest.

42:00.059 --> 42:03.686
- I'm not blind, okay.
- How do you deal with that?

42:03.771 --> 42:07.774
It's not an issue for me. It's really not.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.443
- Really?
- I'm past that point.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.947
I'm completely committed to what I do.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.784
To my work. It defines me,
completely, as a person.

42:18.285 --> 42:21.871
And it fulfills me. I'm very happy.

42:22.456 --> 42:26.125
That particular sacrifice is a gesture,
a symbol of my commitment.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.046
- Quite a gesture.
- I know it seems that way.

42:30.130 --> 42:33.550
It's like giving up smoking,
the first year is tough,

42:33.634 --> 42:36.302
but then you don't care
if you see people smoke.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.805
I quit two years ago
and when I see smokers,

42:38.847 --> 42:42.392
I want to French kiss them
to suck the smoke out of their lungs.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.561
Well, don't be a priest!

42:45.479 --> 42:50.233
I really admire your commitment.
I don't think I could take it.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.735
You've sacrificed for what you do.

42:52.820 --> 42:57.532
There comes a point
where I just crave contact,

42:57.741 --> 43:02.829
you know, like I want
to touch someone, and be touched.

43:04.665 --> 43:05.915
You're amazing.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.169
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

43:13.382 --> 43:16.301
- Thus endeth the sex conversation?
- Thus endeth.

43:19.179 --> 43:22.807
I bet no one ever asks
the Dalai Lama these questions.

43:30.024 --> 43:35.361
Len, don't argue with me.
I have it right here, and it's not right.

43:35.404 --> 43:39.616
I'll be back in an hour, run it again.
God, I hate these Harvard guys!

43:42.620 --> 43:46.122
Rachel Rose! When's that going down?

43:46.206 --> 43:48.541
- Thursday.
- Thursday night, 8: 00 p. M. Dinner.

43:48.917 --> 43:51.878
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, I have a pretty good feeling.

43:52.755 --> 43:56.883
- Where are you taking her?
- I thought Ernie's.

43:56.967 --> 44:01.763
You can't take her to Ernie's!
It's been around since we were kids!

44:02.348 --> 44:05.850
- You cannot take Rachel Rose there.
- Definitely not.

44:05.893 --> 44:10.104
- You must go somewhere new and hot.
- Definitely hot.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.815
- What's new and hot?
- What do we know about her?

44:12.900 --> 44:17.236
Twenty-nine years old, journalism
school, Middle East Affairs expert.

44:17.279 --> 44:20.031
Perfect. Middle Eastern.
She can order in Arabic.

44:21.742 --> 44:25.703
- What's a good place?
- Delphini's. Four stars.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.038
You need a reservation.

44:27.081 --> 44:31.250
- Will you wear a suit, or go casual?
- I don't know. I guess cas...

44:31.418 --> 44:35.004
- No, suit, definitely a suit.
- Shut up, Rain Man. Seriously!

44:36.423 --> 44:39.384
- Now you're making me think.
- Relax.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.219
What if you guys came with me?

44:42.429 --> 44:46.265
Bring a priest on your date?
What kind of strategy is that?

44:46.350 --> 44:50.978
Not a priest, my friend Brian,
and his girlfriend, Anna. A double date.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.358
Pretend you're a couple. Are you busy?

44:55.693 --> 44:59.112
- You could bring your cell phone.
- That's not the point.

44:59.196 --> 45:02.865
- What's the point?
- You don't need a chaperone.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.744
I don't need a chaperone,
I need some help. Please?

45:07.371 --> 45:09.372
I'm begging you.

45:12.376 --> 45:16.129
That's how the business is going.
People want news to be edgy.

45:16.171 --> 45:19.006
- That's why Brokaw stands now.
- What?

45:19.091 --> 45:22.552
- Tom Brokaw stands to read the news.
- The whole time?

45:22.803 --> 45:24.595
- Yeah.
- He does?

45:25.639 --> 45:29.142
- He's done it for about a year now.
- Really? I gotta watch the news more.

45:29.476 --> 45:32.562
I saw your sarin gas report.
It was very powerful.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.648
Thanks.
I earned my stripes with that piece.

45:35.941 --> 45:40.737
- I got through a bris without fainting.
- I vetoed the "McOyster."

45:41.071 --> 45:43.990
- A grateful nation thanks you.
- Made me a star.

45:44.241 --> 45:46.868
So, how long have you two
been together?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.997
- Oh, right...
- God, we go way back.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.833
We've all known each other
since we were kids.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.169
- I had a crush on Anna.
- Really?

45:56.211 --> 46:00.006
- I told you that. She knew that.
- No, you didn't!

46:01.133 --> 46:04.469
Anyway, we reconnected
a couple of months ago,

46:04.511 --> 46:07.972
and we just clicked, very unexpectedly.

46:08.015 --> 46:11.100
I think it's great
to be friends first, don't you?

46:11.185 --> 46:14.020
Always. Friends first.

46:15.689 --> 46:18.483
So, do you write your own reports?

46:18.567 --> 46:22.028
Yeah. I wouldn't trust
anyone else to get them right.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.573
You write your own sermons, right?

46:25.657 --> 46:27.200
Actually, I download them off the Net.

46:27.242 --> 46:32.371
- I use www. Hotgod.com.
- Really?

46:34.708 --> 46:37.835
No. No, I was kidding.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.755
- So, you do write your own sermons?
- Yeah.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.007
He writes beautiful sermons.

46:43.050 --> 46:47.720
Actually, I like to improvise.
Keeps everybody on their toes.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.849
I guess you can't do that
too much with the news.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.393
- What?
- Riff.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.938
No, not really.

47:05.823 --> 47:08.825
I bet the Middle East is lovely
this time of year.

47:09.409 --> 47:12.036
Well, not if you're Kurdish.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.748
Excuse me.

47:18.043 --> 47:22.672
Oh, my God! The Iraqi Defense Minister
just committed suicide.

47:23.215 --> 47:26.175
- Is that bad or good?
- Well, it...

47:27.594 --> 47:31.222
- Brian, would you explain it to him?
- I will.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.769
- How's it going?
- She's beautiful.

47:36.895 --> 47:39.814
- She's great, too.
- She's very adult.

47:39.898 --> 47:44.277
- You're doing great, we're impressed.
- You look so hot in your suit.

47:44.820 --> 47:49.490
- Thank you. You look beautiful.
- You do. You look amazing.

47:49.616 --> 47:53.703
- Thanks, men.
- There's something about you tonight.

47:53.996 --> 47:56.455
- An absence...
- The cell phone.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.293
- It's set to vibrate.
- Oh, my...

48:01.378 --> 48:05.214
- That's sexy.
- Don't you want to be free of that?

48:05.299 --> 48:10.887
No. You don't understand.
I have a relationship with my phone.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.973
We have a chemistry together.
I can't explain it.

48:14.600 --> 48:18.269
- Chemistry's a funny thing.
- Yes, it is.

48:18.312 --> 48:21.314
Are you speaking abstractly,
or specifically?

48:23.025 --> 48:24.692
Abstractly.

48:28.780 --> 48:32.241
Well, looks like I'm going to Baghdad.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.828
- Two seconds. It was a pleasure.
- Yeah.

48:36.246 --> 48:38.789
- Nice to meet you.
- Good luck to you both.

48:38.832 --> 48:41.250
- Talk to you soon.
- All right.

48:41.335 --> 48:44.003
- I'll talk to you.
- Okay, call me.

48:44.046 --> 48:46.505
- Call me soon.
- Thanks, again.

48:46.548 --> 48:48.049
Bye.

48:57.643 --> 48:59.310
What are you thinking about, right now?

49:00.771 --> 49:01.854
It's funny.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.940
- I was at the Met yesterday.
- Again?

49:04.024 --> 49:06.859
I go every week,
and I noticed a painting,

49:06.902 --> 49:10.029
a watercolor by Bonnard
I've passed every time.

49:10.072 --> 49:16.327
This time I looked at it, and I was
just riveted. It was so beautiful.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.790
I was just wondering
why I never saw it before.

49:22.584 --> 49:27.254
Sometimes we don't see things
until we're ready to see them

49:27.381 --> 49:30.466
in a certain way. You know?

49:32.010 --> 49:33.886
Very true.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.849
Yeah.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.145
What's going on with Ruth and Ethan?

49:45.899 --> 49:50.069
Ethan married a Catholic girl,
and that did not go over well.

49:50.404 --> 49:54.198
- That's why they're fighting?
- Not fighting. They're not talking.

49:54.616 --> 49:58.411
- Two years now. No comunicado.
- Are you serious?

49:58.495 --> 50:02.790
- Totally. It's...
- What? Weren't they close, then?

50:02.958 --> 50:05.960
As close as Ruth and Jake.

50:08.463 --> 50:11.090
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah.

50:11.133 --> 50:13.884
You see why tonight was not just a date.

50:21.476 --> 50:25.104
I feel terrible about
having to cut the night short.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.107
I totally understand.
When the beeper beeps...

50:28.942 --> 50:30.901
I'm just going to be packing.

50:30.944 --> 50:35.823
Would you like to come up
for a nightcap, keep me company?

50:39.369 --> 50:44.081
I'd love to, but I should leave you.
I mean, you're going to Baghdad.

50:44.124 --> 50:48.210
Yeah. Yeah, long flight, I know.
Well, okay.

50:48.336 --> 50:52.423
But when you get back,
we should definitely get together.

50:53.133 --> 50:56.469
- I would love to. It's a date.
- Okay.

50:58.346 --> 51:00.181
- Bye.
- Bye.

51:14.112 --> 51:15.112
Taxi!

51:21.286 --> 51:23.412
- Well, this is me.
- Okay.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.165
You wanna come up for a while?

51:26.291 --> 51:30.336
I'd love to, but I should get home.
I have an early conference call.

51:30.837 --> 51:33.172
Me, too. I gotta talk to the big guy.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.301
- Right.
- Calls early.

51:38.553 --> 51:41.680
- Rain check, though.
- Yeah, definitely.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.058
Goodnight.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.521
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.008
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:20.428 --> 52:24.890
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know, what am I doing here?

52:43.577 --> 52:45.161
I haven't screamed that hard

52:45.245 --> 52:47.580
since the US hockey team
beat the Russians.

52:47.664 --> 52:52.543
Incredible. I wanted to do that
since you walked off that airplane.

52:52.627 --> 52:56.881
Really? Right away?
You hadn't seen me in 16 years.

52:57.090 --> 53:01.010
I know! You were this tough,
sexy businesswoman.

53:01.094 --> 53:05.639
I just wanted to pull you into security
and give you a cavity search.

53:06.892 --> 53:09.268
That would have been impulsive.

53:09.311 --> 53:13.105
Well, this is pretty impulsive, for me.

53:15.108 --> 53:18.277
- Believe me.
- It felt good though, right?

53:18.320 --> 53:22.072
Yeah, good.
Just, I mean, a little complicated.

53:25.160 --> 53:29.496
What would people at work think
if they knew you slept with a rabbi?

53:29.581 --> 53:31.582
Could be a scandal.

53:37.631 --> 53:38.964
- Listen.
- Yeah?

53:39.466 --> 53:44.094
You know what my life is like.
I'm only here for a little while.

53:44.137 --> 53:45.471
Yes.

53:46.306 --> 53:49.934
And I'm fine, just hanging out,
having a great time with you.

53:52.812 --> 53:57.149
But sometimes I want
to jump you, too. What can I say?

53:58.568 --> 54:03.656
- Is that okay?
- That's okay. It's more than okay.

54:06.701 --> 54:10.204
Think we should
say anything to Brian?

54:10.789 --> 54:14.917
I think it might be a little weird for him.

54:15.794 --> 54:20.673
- You don't think he'd understand?
- No, I just... I don't know.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.093
I think we should just keep it simple.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.346
I'm for simple.

54:28.848 --> 54:32.518
I have something simple
I'd like to discuss with you.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.274
Do you want to know

54:38.358 --> 54:44.822
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

54:45.156 --> 54:50.494
I see in your hair?
I feel it could be there

54:51.079 --> 54:55.374
Somehow tonight

54:58.044 --> 55:00.921
And do you want to find

55:01.006 --> 55:07.261
Something worth saving?
The change would do me right

55:07.721 --> 55:13.100
I've been just waiting
and hesitating

55:13.226 --> 55:15.102
With this heart

55:17.272 --> 55:17.772
Of mine

55:27.282 --> 55:29.366
You're still a mystery

55:29.743 --> 55:36.248
But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

55:37.208 --> 55:42.212
I feel completed
Like it's something I needed

55:42.255 --> 55:44.590
For this heart

55:46.301 --> 55:46.801
Of mine

55:56.811 --> 56:01.482
There's always something so tragic

56:02.942 --> 56:07.446
About a hopeless romantic

56:24.047 --> 56:27.800
We have a Jake Schram here
for Anna Reilly. Yes?

56:28.927 --> 56:30.010
Okay.

56:31.179 --> 56:34.973
I'll be coming here a lot,
so let's forget this name thing,

56:35.016 --> 56:38.936
you can just say, "Hey, Jake,"
and I'll say, "Hey, T-Bone."

56:40.730 --> 56:43.816
- That pass is good for one hour.
- Okay. Thank you.

56:44.984 --> 56:49.738
Wednesday night, you have a call
at 7:00 and dinner at 8:00.

56:49.823 --> 56:53.117
All right. I'll make the call,
but cancel the dinner. I have a class.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.745
He's late.

56:58.164 --> 57:01.875
Oh, my God.
Are you guys getting serious?

57:02.544 --> 57:05.337
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you are.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.798
- No, we're not.
- I saw it, I can tell!

57:07.841 --> 57:10.592
No, no... Oh, he's here!

57:11.845 --> 57:13.679
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:15.223 --> 57:18.934
Debbie, this is Jake. Jake, vice versa.

57:19.018 --> 57:20.978
- How you doing?
- Hi, Jake.

57:21.020 --> 57:25.274
Can I just say... Good. Good for you.

57:25.358 --> 57:27.526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:28.736 --> 57:32.406
- Debbie...
- Debbie... Debbie, what?

57:34.784 --> 57:36.577
The numbers are good for you, now?

57:37.078 --> 57:42.875
Good. Just run one more scenario
and assume an 8% I RR.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.418
Bye.

57:47.964 --> 57:50.883
- Hi.
- You're really gonna run an 8% I RR?

57:50.925 --> 57:54.595
- I'd go with 15%, at least.
- Stick with the Torah.

57:54.679 --> 57:58.807
Look at this place. It's ridiculous!
It's so impressive.

58:00.185 --> 58:03.020
- Try again. Hey.
- Hi.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.981
Can we close your blinds and... What?

58:06.065 --> 58:09.318
- Remember that guy I told you about?
- The guy...

58:09.402 --> 58:13.614
Mr. 23rd Floor? Check it out.
There, with the huge plant.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.325
- Nothing interesting will be going on...
- Trust me.

58:19.245 --> 58:22.247
- Holy Majoly!
- Told you.

58:23.625 --> 58:28.378
Does he have music on in there?
He's, like, porn-slapping her.

58:28.796 --> 58:34.343
- Okay, we should go now.
- He has healthy self-confidence.

58:34.594 --> 58:38.305
- Ready? Let's go.
- Hang on, I'm learning something here.

58:39.015 --> 58:41.600
- We'll be late.
- You'll benefit from this.

58:43.019 --> 58:45.229
I can't Wednesday night,
I've a class.

58:45.271 --> 58:46.813
What class?

58:46.898 --> 58:50.359
I try new things.
I'm embarrassed talking about it.

58:50.443 --> 58:53.654
Don't be embarrassed.
Many people take aikido.

58:53.738 --> 58:55.781
- Nope.
- Line-dancing.

58:55.823 --> 58:59.910
- Not even close.
- What's the big deal, why can't I know?

58:59.953 --> 59:02.037
- Feng shui?
- No!

59:02.413 --> 59:05.999
Don't be embarrassed if it is.
Don't tell me, I don't need to know.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.545
I like the "mysterioso" quality.
It's very sexy.

59:09.629 --> 59:13.006
- That's good. All right. I gotta pee.
- Hold on, I want to tell you something.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.971
Hold that thought.

59:25.728 --> 59:31.108
- Look who's here!
- Hey! Hey!

59:31.150 --> 59:36.238
Holy... How you doing?
Larry, Ellen, what are you doing here?

59:36.489 --> 59:40.409
We're buying a turkey!
No, we're seeing a movie.

59:40.493 --> 59:42.786
Are you alone?

59:43.162 --> 59:46.206
No. I mean, I'm with an old friend.

59:46.374 --> 59:50.919
Why, when Emma Gerber
wants you to take her daughter out?

59:51.004 --> 59:53.672
You should call,
the family's very wealthy.

59:53.715 --> 59:57.009
- Though she's no Rachel Rose.
- They can make donations.

59:57.093 --> 01:00:01.555
I've got to call her, but right now
I'm taking a break from dating.

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:04.725
Look who it is!

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:07.936
- We were talking about Rachel.
- Naturally.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.355
- Did you come together?
- No...

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:15.068
- This is why I love New York.
- It's true.

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:18.780
These are my movie girls,
this is Roz and Chaya Lentz.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:22.534
- We're seeing the Garcia picture.
- So are we!

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:26.872
My daughter's been back a week.
She said she called you a few times.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.583
She's disappointed
not to have seen you.

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:33.712
- How you doing? Perfect.
- This is your friend?

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:38.425
This is my buddy, Anna.
These are people...

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:41.803
This is Larry Friedman,
president of the synagogue.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.222
I've heard so much about you.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:48.352
- Nice to meet you.
- And Bonnie Rose, and the Luntzes...

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:49.895
- Lentzes!
- Lentzes.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:53.940
- They're from the congregation.
- I didn't get your last name.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.942
- Reilly.
- Reilly?

01:00:56.027 --> 01:01:01.073
We, Anna and I and Father Brian,
as children, used to play.

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.574
What are you seeing?

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.494
- Andy Garcia...
- The IMAX... He's in that, right?

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:10.082
- I don't think so. We should go.
- I thought he was in that.

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.419
Where are the paper towels?

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:18.924
There are no paper towels.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.845
I'm in a crisis here! I need help!

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:27.391
I need someone who,
when there are no paper towels,

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.602
they go to a goddamn store
and buy some paper towels!

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:35.524
How many jobs do you hope to pull
with no paper towels?

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.109
- You okay?
- I'm cool.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:40.612
I need someone with
a little common sense around here.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.285
Why not get somebody else?

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:51.957
- Okay, what?
- If we were going out, I'd be pissed off!

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:56.795
That was a scary situation for me,
and you made it worse!

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.548
That is no excuse for what just went on!

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:03.093
I'm sorry, too bad,
you have to deal with it.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.512
- Then I'd say...
- What would you say?

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:09.683
Come on, bring it, bring the pain!
Say it, say it all.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:14.646
It's a good thing
we're not going out, then.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.314
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:20.652
- I wasn't really mad, were you?
- No, but you'll still get a spanking.

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.263
- You are in such good shape.
- Are you all right?

01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:54.853
No, you gotta stretch.
You gotta stretch, or you'll tighten up.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:59.900
- Come on. Does that hurt?
- No, it feels good.

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:04.112
Harder.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.406
Harder!

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.954
- Okay, that's enough.
- You're such a wimp.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.036
Only three people
have this number,

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.330
so if you're not one of them,
leave me alone.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.875
Hey, it's me. Are you there?

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.754
Hello? Pick up the phone!

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:10.011
Probably still at work. It's not that
important. Just thinking about you.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:14.182
Maybe we can do dinner this week,
just you and me.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:17.561
This is Brian, by the way.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:22.190
You know where to find me.
Call me, okay? Bye.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.156
- Gotta go now.
- Give me 20 minutes.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:34.077
- Twenty minutes? I'm late.
- Okay, 15 minutes.

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:39.082
- Fourteen and a half minutes. Please.
- I have to go back to the mines.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.960
- We all have to.
- Don't you have work?

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:45.797
I do. We're doing a hostile takeover
of another congregation.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.466
- Okay. You do that.
- Okay.

01:04:48.509 --> 01:04:51.094
- I'm officially going now.
- Okay.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.972
Toll booth. Ding dong.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.433
- Time to pay the toll.
- Okay.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.772
There. I paid.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.066
God was showing off
when He made you.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.159
Okay, go.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.205
You'll be back. They all come back.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.864
Yes, they all come back...

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.616
Sooner or later, they all...

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.410
Hey.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.290
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you doing?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.668
What's up, my man?

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:08.088
- Why are you here?
- I want to get the karaoke machine.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:11.216
- Am I interrupting?
- Yeah, I got a blonde in the back.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.468
- Let's go.
- Now?

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:16.221
- Yes.
- Okay. Come in for a second.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:20.225
- No, the place closes in 20 minutes.
- Come in for one second.

01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:24.771
Hey, ADD boy, right here.
If you want to get it, let's get it.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:26.898
But be with me when we get it.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.193
- Stay focused, okay?
- I'm with you. Okay.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.077
Test, test. Sibilance...

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:44.040
I'm the king of rock.
Ain't none higher. This doesn't work.

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.918
The guy's in the back, I can't find him.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:51.047
The contractor wants to come
on Tuesday. Can you do that?

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:54.759
- Tuesday...
- We have to punch up or punch out...

01:06:55.344 --> 01:07:00.598
- I didn't understand, I just said okay.
- Tuesday, I'm with the Schwartzes.

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:04.541
What about Thursday night?
I think they can do Thursday night.

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:09.107
I can't do that, I got a thing.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:12.861
Can you cancel? We're behind
schedule, they're getting irritable.

01:07:12.945 --> 01:07:18.491
It's just that Anna wants me
to take her to this office party...

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:22.996
- I don't know what it is.
- Really? Is it a big thing?

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.791
No, it's just that
she needs someone to go with.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:30.462
- No, she didn't mention it to me.
- No, it's not a... Whatever.

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:33.256
He's a friend

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:36.718
and he's always
been a good friend of mine

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:41.473
But lately something's changed
that ain't hard to define

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:45.101
It's just he's got himself a girl
and I want to make her mine

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:48.772
And she's watching him
with those eyes

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:52.776
And she's loving him with her body
and of course I just know it

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:55.570
You know that I was Jessie's girl...

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.366
How you guys doing? I'm Don.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.537
- Don. Rhyme with flan.
- Hi, Don.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:08.374
- You have any question?
- Yes. Indeed, Don, we do.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:12.837
- Is this a good machine?
- Yes, if you're a cheap bastard!

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.341
Just doing comedy with you.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:21.930
That one is okay, but if you
really serious about karaoke...

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.933
- We are.
- Then there only one model for you.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.602
The Audio 2000.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:33.649
This baby got the 16-bit dual
DA converter, three-beam tracking.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:38.988
Digital key controller, so you can
change the pitch if your voice sucks.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.740
I don't need that.

01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:44.410
That's nice. How much?

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:48.288
- Price is not important.
- No, price is very important.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:52.292
Okay, you got me, take me away!
It's a little bit expensive.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.921
But let me tell you, it's worth it.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.715
When you sing to your girlfriend,

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:02.970
and her heart... Boom!
Fall down on the floor,

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.140
then you say, "Thank you, Don!"

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:08.560
Okay. How much does it cost exactly?

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:17.944
All right, here's the real deal, okay?

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:21.781
I don't usually do this,
but you look like cool guys,

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:26.077
and I got a piece of ass last night
so I'm feeling generous.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.706
I'll let you have it for 1, 300.

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.541
- 1, 300?
- Final offer.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:37.087
- Excuse me, I feel a little warm.
- My friend, he gets a little warm.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:42.260
Oh, man! What is that?

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.930
- Get out of here! Is that real?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:52.312
They'll love you.

01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:55.940
They're fascinated by those who
live on less than $100,000 a year.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.902
All right, I feel ready.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.696
Give me some business terms
so I sound right.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.573
- A BSC deal.
- What's that?

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:07.368
Booze, schmooze and cruise, dude.
How do I look?

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.787
- Incredible.
- How are my teeth?

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:13.791
- Let me see... No, you're perfect.
- Thank you.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.920
- Ready, Rabbi?
- No, but let's do it, anyway.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.481
Anna, have a shot.
Just got to borrow her for one second.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.652
You think you can talk?
This woman can talk.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.862
- Oh, Len.
- You know you can.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:48.701
Thank you.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:52.914
That's his problem, he can't drive.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:57.126
If the guy just went down the middle,
like Sprewell. Same thing.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:03.258
Excuse me, Rabbi... We need help
with a question of Talmudic precedent.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:04.968
Excuse me.

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:09.472
Very good! "Talmudic."
Where did you learn that?

01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:12.558
Look at the city!

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.861
- You think Len was a Ritalin child?
- Still is.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:27.699
- They love you.
- Only 'cause I bust their balls.

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:33.329
No, they really respect you.
You should be running that company.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.374
- Actually, they want me to.
- What do you mean?

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:40.878
They asked me to run the high-tech
group in San Francisco.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:44.424
Anna! Are you serious? That's...

01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:47.719
I knew it was coming.
Who else was there?

01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.887
Listen to you! That's incredible!

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:53.558
If you think I had no life before...
I'll disappear.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:57.228
But this is everything
you've worked for, right?

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.398
I'm so proud of you,
I'm so happy for you.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:04.193
Well, here's the thing, Jake.

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:06.738
I've been thinking about it, and...

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:11.743
I'm excited, but not as excited
as I am about you and me.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:15.204
And so I don't think I wanna go,

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:19.208
because I wanna be near you,
so I thought I'd transfer and stay here.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:22.920
What do you think?

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:31.095
That's... unexpected.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.264
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.268
Are you sure that's the best thing?

01:12:37.936 --> 01:12:39.562
For you?

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:43.775
I don't know. I thought you'd be excited.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.778
No... No, I am. I'm just...

01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:49.655
I'm sorry, I thought...
Am I off-base here?

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:55.870
No, you're not. It was just an impulse.
It's totally fine. Really.

01:12:55.954 --> 01:13:00.208
- I thought that we...
- I think that tequila made me giddy.

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:02.210
Shall we go somewhere
and talk about this?

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:04.170
No, no, no.

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:10.218
No, it's so fine. I'm having
a great time. Let's have fun, okay?

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.138
No, I don't...

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.433
Let's go dance!

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:23.606
I never had no problems, yeah

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.735
Burning down the one-night stands

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.364
And everything around me...

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.538
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.082
- Oh, my!
- Psycho, psycho!

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.337
I can't laugh, I'm so full.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.841
How'd you stay so skinny
with cooking like this?

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:36.304
He was blessed with my genes.
Ethan, that's another story.

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.806
When he was a kid, he was a little chub!

01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:42.935
He missed school once
because he couldn't fit his pants.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.397
- You're joking.
- It's true, he had to call in fat.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.985
Mom, he never called in fat, come on.

01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:54.071
Give the guy a break, he looks great.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:15:00.203
He's working out with a trainer,
he's on a regimen, he looks trim.

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:02.747
He looks trim because she can't cook.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:06.125
She's a good cook.
You'd know if you tried her food.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.920
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Get it?

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:11.339
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.759
What were we talking about?

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:18.179
The meal was so good. Thank you.

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:22.225
- As always.
- Someone has to feed the skinny ones.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.978
Now you guys get the dishes,
and the ladies will talk.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.775
Jake, put on some water for tea.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:55.841
It's like a fairy tale.
Those flowers framing you.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:59.845
That's called a huppah.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:07.603
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful together!

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.482
Please. We were so young.
We were kids.

01:16:12.317 --> 01:16:15.528
I give Jake grief,
but you're all doing it the right way.

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:20.324
It takes at least ten years to know
yourself well and stop being an idiot.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.120
It's hard enough without
binding yourself to another idiot.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:30.251
What's scary is spending ten years
going after important things,

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:35.006
you get those things, then suspect
you went after the wrong things,

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:39.885
and, in regard to the important things,
you're still an idiot.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.015
Can I ask you a question?

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.269
Is my son a good kisser?

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.649
- You're in a good mood.
- I'm usually in a good mood.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.778
But you're in a particularly
good mood right now.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:02.700
Okay. Yes, I am.
I'm in a very good mood.

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:06.078
Okay. Do you want to share anything?

01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:15.546
- Not quite yet. Maybe soon.
- Really? Soon?

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:16.881
Okay.

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:18.883
- Well, you let me know.
- Okay, I will.

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.885
I'll be looking out for that.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.720
That's what she said...

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:28.309
- I'm so sorry.
- Jesus, what happened?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.231
- Nothing.
- Girl talk. We're fine.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:41.614
I didn't go into explicit detail.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.241
I can't believe you did that.
It's between us!

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.744
Jake, she figured it out on her own.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:50.331
- Did you try to deny it?
- Come on, Jake, she knew!

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.209
No wonder she was crying!

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:57.755
I was crying, too, all right?
We had a nice talk about it.

01:17:57.881 --> 01:18:00.007
She was upset, but not angry.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:03.010
- She put on that face.
- She didn't.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.721
I know, okay? All right? I mean...

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.974
You have no idea of the nightmare
I'm in for now.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:12.603
This is not a nightmare, okay? Stop it.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.398
Hey, look at me.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.733
Look at me.

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:25.032
- I am in love with you, Jake.
- I love you, too.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:31.122
No. You are in love with me,
you're just scared of what it involves.

01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:35.292
- Yes, I am.
- Me, too, but I'm dealing with it.

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:39.797
Because I'm overwhelmed by feelings
for you and I want to work it out.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.800
- Great, how do I work it out?
- Okay.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:47.888
Let's take it from the top. It's not about
your mother, brother, or synagogue.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.474
Just you. What do you need
to work it out?

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:54.854
Those things are me, understand?
I can't separate them out.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.151
It's hard to accept, but the fact
you're not Jewish is a problem for me.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.986
I don't think so.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:07.324
Okay, all I'm saying is that
you should be honest with yourself.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:11.996
I think if it was just up to you,
you'd stick with this relationship,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.584
but it's a problem because you think
other people can't deal with it.

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:20.504
- No, they can't.
- Give them credit, it's the 21 st century.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.593
What does the 21 st century have to
do with anything? This is you and me!

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:30.514
- I thought we were just having fun.
- That's my point, I'm having fun.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:34.059
I'm having fun, too. This is a lot of fun!

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:37.563
Exactly. So, why throw it away?

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:48.073
Can't you see that you're asking me
to risk losing everything I value,

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:50.034
just to see if we work?

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.663
I mean, I love you, but...

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.710
We're different in so many ways
unrelated to you not being Jewish.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:02.046
What are you saying?

01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:05.633
We have totally different priorities.
Look at your life.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:09.423
I don't think there's room in your life
for what I'm spiritually committed to.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.557
That is so unfair.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:20.523
Your faith is a huge part
of what I love about you.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:26.904
But you must be patient. It doesn't
come as easily for others as for you.

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:31.534
You will never find the kind
of relationship I know you want,

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:35.746
and you will never be the kind
of spiritual leader you could be

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.415
until you learn to put faith
in other people.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:44.088
I'm not saying we should marry,
all I'm saying

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:48.342
is that I'm in love with you,
and I want to give it a real shot.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.805
I don't know what to say.

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:56.851
How about, "I've always wanted
someone like you, and I won't lose you."

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:05.943
I'm sorry...

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.740
You will be when you realize I've gone
and I'm not coming back.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:18.914
This is my apartment. You get out.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:30.217
- It's for you. Who calls at this hour?
- I'm sorry.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.761
I was dreaming
about my mother's sausages.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.432
- Hello?
- Brian?

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:38.392
What's wrong?

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.479
I need to talk to you.
Can you come over? Please?

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:48.152
Don't move. I'll be right over.
No, I'll be right there. Okay.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.673
- Are you okay?
- Terrific.

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:14.303
- I came running right over.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to call so late.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:17.765
No, it's fine, don't worry. What's wrong?

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:19.433
- Everything.
- What?

01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:22.227
- Me!
- You? You're perfect.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:26.857
- I am a loser!
- You're not, what are you saying?

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.610
- I'm a workaholic.
- No, you're not.

01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:36.158
Okay, yes, you are. But you're our
workaholic, and we're proud of you.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:39.328
- Brian...
- What?

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:44.041
You're my friend, and if I ask you
something, you'll answer honestly?

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.418
Of course, you know I will.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.881
When you look at me,
when you look at my life,

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:55.302
do you think, "There's a girl
whose values are all out of whack?"

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.764
No, and certainly not in that voice.

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:00.766
- Have I got no spirit?
- What?

01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:03.018
I know I'm fun to hang out with,

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:06.605
but does my life seem shallow to you?

01:23:07.565 --> 01:23:12.069
- Am I spiritually empty?
- No, are you crazy?

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:17.408
You've got more spirit in you
than most guys in robes out there.

01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:20.828
You're a natural, you radiate.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:24.915
Trust me. What's going on here?
What's this about?

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:29.461
I don't even know where to begin, Brian.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:33.757
You're my best friend,
and I've been keeping stuff from you.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.343
All these feelings...

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:41.557
Now something has happened,
and I can't keep it from you anymore.

01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:43.934
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:47.521
There are things I have to say,
and I feel bad.

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:53.110
- I have things to say, too.
- Mine are big and bad. I need to...

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.279
No, please, just listen...

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.162
- I love you, too.
- What?

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:09.293
I love you, that's what you want to say,
but you're scared, so I'll say it first.

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:16.717
- Brian...
- It's okay, trust me. Trust me.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:20.804
We can't fight it,
it's too strong. It's okay.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.640
No, Brian, I can't!

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.979
It's the vows, isn't it?

01:24:30.356 --> 01:24:33.817
It's the vows, they make
you feel guilty. I can't believe it.

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:37.654
I shouldn't have had
that sex talk with you, I knew it.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:41.825
I knew it. In my head,
a voice said, "Don't go here..."

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.577
You don't understand.

01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:47.790
Right now, for the first time ever,
I feel jealous of Jake.

01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:52.461
I envy him. This would be so easy
if I was him. I picked the wrong gig.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.838
- Let me talk to you!
- Admit it!

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:58.675
If I was a rabbi,
you could love me without guilt.

01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:01.011
- Listen to me!
- What?

01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:05.182
I am in love with a rabbi.

01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:09.728
- Sorry?
- I'm in love with Jake.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.022
Yeah.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.986
That's what I was trying to tell you.

01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:25.828
I'm stunned.
I'm stunned, I'm paralyzed... What?

01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.626
Excuse me, my mouth just went all dry.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:37.798
I can't believe this.
When did this happen?

01:25:37.882 --> 01:25:40.634
- We've been together since July.
- July?

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:44.555
July?

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:49.768
We should have told you,
but we weren't sure how you'd react.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:54.857
I'm glad you saved it, because
it's definitely less weird for me now.

01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:58.026
Brian...

01:25:58.069 --> 01:26:00.445
Let's talk about this. You don't drink.

01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:04.491
In light of recent revelations,
no one is in a position

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:08.620
to say what the other one does
or does not do with much authority.

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.707
Oh, God!

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.751
You must think I'm such an idiot.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:18.755
- No, Brian.
- No, I think I'm an idiot.

01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:23.510
I mean, all these moments with you
I've been walking on a cloud,

01:26:24.762 --> 01:26:27.890
it's just been the reflected glow
of you and Jake.

01:26:27.932 --> 01:26:29.766
That's not true.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:32.186
I'm so embarrassed.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:38.859
God, talk about a bad case
of the third wheel!

01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:44.031
- Brian!
- I feel like I'm on some bad TV show.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:45.949
- Melrose Priest!
- No...

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:51.705
I don't get this. Why now?
Why tell me like this?

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:56.251
After months of lying, why call me
over tonight and cry to me?

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.716
He broke up with you, didn't he?

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:10.390
That moron broke up with you,
and you called your friend, the priest.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:13.810
- I...
- It makes total sense, it's just...

01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:17.731
Tonight, I really didn't want to be one.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:20.817
Oh, Brian...

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:35.225
Yes, I heard about that.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:38.061
My grandfather and father were mohels.

01:28:38.187 --> 01:28:40.731
Excuse me, I'd like to make a toast...

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.607
Rabbi Jacob Schram!

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.027
Rabbi Jacob Schram!

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:47.821
Oh, Rabbi Jacob...

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:51.366
Oh... Hello!

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:55.203
- May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Father Brian Finn.

01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:59.374
I'm looking for my old friend,
Rabbi Jacob Schram, and there he is.

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:03.462
- Brian, what's going on?
- Looking smart and breaking hearts.

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:06.131
- What are you doing?
- Don't smile at me.

01:29:06.257 --> 01:29:09.343
- I'm on to you, and I'm in no mood...
- What's going on?

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.346
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:16.308
I'm not drunk, I'm Irish.
This is milk to me.

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:18.143
What's going on?

01:29:18.227 --> 01:29:22.647
- It's okay.
- It's not! My best friend lied to me!

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.362
- And he stole my girlfriend, on top of it.
- Come here.

01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:32.240
- Did they change the rules?
- Take your hands off me!

01:29:36.662 --> 01:29:38.914
Give me that! I can't believe you!

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:41.333
Don't lie here, this is the big room.

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:46.254
God doesn't look favorably on it.
He throws lightning bolts! At liars!

01:29:46.297 --> 01:29:51.885
- How did you find out?
- How? How do you think?

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:54.971
- She told you.
- She was crying on my shoulder.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.473
What did you expect?

01:29:56.557 --> 01:30:00.936
Did you think she'd just take it
on the chin after how you treated her?

01:30:00.978 --> 01:30:03.980
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Listen to me!

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:08.110
Anna is very special,
she's not like other girls.

01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:11.238
You said some things
to her that I resent.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:14.908
You can't just write her off
like one of your dates, I won't let you.

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:18.161
Brian, I'm in love with her! Okay?

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:22.624
I'm sorry you found out like this,
but the fact is,

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.168
that it's between me and her.

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:28.755
It was between you and her,
but now it's between you and me.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.882
Why is it between you and me?

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:34.719
- Because I love her.
- I know, I love her, too.

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:38.056
No... I'm in love with her.

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:43.728
- What?
- It came as quite a shock to her, too.

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:51.945
- You're in love with her?
- No one seems to have noticed this...

01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:53.321
It's very strange.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:56.783
I mean, she's like your sister, Brian...

01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:00.745
Yes, thank you for adding
new depths to my confusion.

01:31:02.373 --> 01:31:08.128
Damn it, Jake. You have a whole city
full of women at your feet.

01:31:08.212 --> 01:31:13.300
Why go for the first woman
I've ever had any romantic feeling for?

01:31:13.384 --> 01:31:16.011
Wait! Listen to what you're saying.

01:31:16.053 --> 01:31:19.431
You're saying I should have
sensed the possibility

01:31:19.515 --> 01:31:22.934
that a Catholic priest had a crush
on my secret girlfriend!

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:26.229
So what? You know how much
I care about her.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:29.149
You could have known
it would end this way.

01:31:29.233 --> 01:31:31.067
I know? What does that mean?

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:34.779
Your casual relationships
with women never work,

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:40.452
because they always fall for you,
because you're smart, funny and cute.

01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:44.915
- Don't put this all on me.
- You could've had a fling with anybody.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:49.127
- Why'd you pull her into your bed?
- She pulled me into her bed!

01:31:49.212 --> 01:31:50.754
I don't believe that.

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:53.673
It's the truth. She's a woman,
not the Virgin Mary!

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.651
Let me get this straight.

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:15.278
I'm talking to a priest

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:22.369
who went on a bender because
his best friend, a rabbi, stole his girl?

01:32:23.162 --> 01:32:24.329
Right.

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:29.709
Thank you. I want to thank you
for telling me this story.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:33.964
- Why?
- Because now I can retire.

01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:37.968
You have to give me advice.
That's what this is about.

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:39.970
Oh, God, what do I know?

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:44.683
I'm a half Punjabi Sikh,
one quarter Tamil separatist,

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:48.645
my sister's married
a Jewish doctor from New Jersey,

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.816
and our grandmother was an Irish nun
who left me this bar,

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.985
which is a very long story.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:01.157
You're a Sikh Catholic Muslim
with Jewish in-laws?

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:05.328
Yes. Yes, it gets very complicated.

01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:10.667
- I'm reading Dianetics.
- I don't blame you.

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:17.507
Thank you for listening to me.

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:21.469
- I feel like I should ask for penance.
- I don't do penance.

01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:24.014
I do shots.

01:33:35.359 --> 01:33:37.402
I'll tell you what I know.

01:33:38.195 --> 01:33:40.530
May those who love us, love us.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.533
And those who don't love us,

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.827
may God turn their hearts.

01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:50.582
If He cannot turn their hearts,
may He turn their ankles,

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.793
so that we may know them
by their limping.

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.964
- Slainte.
- Slainte.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:19.402
I'll tell you why I don't want
to know where you are

01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:25.408
I got a joke
I've been dying to tell you

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:32.999
A silent kid is looking down the barrel

01:34:33.292 --> 01:34:39.339
To make the noise that I kept so quiet

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:44.386
Kept it from you, pitseleh

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:54.771
Anna?

01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.148
Anna?

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:03.947
I'm not what's missing
from your life now

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:10.328
I could never be the puzzle pieces

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:17.961
They say that God makes problems
just to see what you can stand

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:24.134
Before you do as the devil pleases

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:28.346
Give up the thing you love

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:33.518
Hey, Brian. It's me again.

01:35:33.936 --> 01:35:39.566
Please call me, okay, Finn?
Brian, call Anna. Please to call.

01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:43.319
Seriously, I really want
to talk to you, okay? Bye.

01:35:52.705 --> 01:35:57.500
I remember I fell in love
with this girl in Prague, in 1968.

01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:02.005
She was beautiful, like Carole Lombard.

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:05.592
She grabbed me in the alley
behind my church,

01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:08.011
she pressed me against the wall,
she kissed me.

01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:12.515
I felt like Richard Chamberlain
in The Thorn Birds,

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.601
in the barn with Meggie.

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.855
I was so happy, I could die.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.651
Did anything happen between you?

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:28.198
Not really. Flirtations, little moments.

01:36:28.365 --> 01:36:32.744
Soon after, the Russians invaded
and I moved to the United States.

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:40.668
I'll tell you something.

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:45.548
If she had kissed me back,
I doubt I'd be sitting here right now.

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:49.385
I would have given it all up.

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.640
I mean, she didn't, but...

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.268
I keep thinking about
what you said in the seminary,

01:36:57.353 --> 01:37:00.396
about how the life of a priest is hard,

01:37:00.439 --> 01:37:05.568
and if you think you'd be happy
doing anything else, you should do it.

01:37:08.197 --> 01:37:11.908
That was my recruitment pitch,
which is not bad when you're starting

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:14.953
because it makes you feel like a Marine.

01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:24.963
The truth is, you can't tell yourself
there is only one thing you could be.

01:37:25.047 --> 01:37:30.426
If you are a priest, or marry a woman,
it's the same challenge.

01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:35.598
You cannot make a real commitment

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:39.102
unless you accept that it is a choice,

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:42.939
which you keep making
again and again.

01:37:46.318 --> 01:37:52.240
I've been a priest over 40 years, and
I fell in love at least once a decade.

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:56.786
You won't tell me
what to do here, will you?

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:01.082
No. God will give you your answer.

01:38:14.805 --> 01:38:17.307
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:38:17.349 --> 01:38:19.017
How are you doing?

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:23.938
What's up?

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:30.737
- You're probably still mad at me...
- Probably? No, I'm definitely still mad.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.991
Did you think you'd stroll over
and find me in a good mood?

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:37.577
No, I knew you'd still be mad at me.

01:38:37.661 --> 01:38:41.331
What do you expect?
You should have just told me.

01:38:41.832 --> 01:38:45.835
I'd have been jealous
and said it would muck things up,

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:48.004
but at least we'd still be friends.

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:51.341
We're still friends, I hope!

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:55.845
Friends don't lie to each other
and set each other up for humiliation.

01:38:55.888 --> 01:39:00.725
That's why I'm here, I wanted
to apologize, if you'd let me talk!

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:04.354
I want to talk,
I've got things I want to vent.

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:07.357
Talk, vent, come on! Go ahead, vent!

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.069
Okay...

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:18.534
Now I lost my momentum.
Go ahead, what do you want to say?

01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:24.540
I wanted to say that I handled
things badly, and I'm sorry.

01:39:24.917 --> 01:39:27.126
You're my best friend.
Please forgive me.

01:39:30.756 --> 01:39:33.716
- That was very simple and direct.
- Thank you.

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:39.681
You're lucky I am a priest.
Forgiveness comes with the job.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.933
You're a good priest.

01:39:47.398 --> 01:39:49.399
I got something for you.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:54.195
I almost didn't because I was
so mad at you, but this was too good.

01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:58.658
That's the Rabbi
Schlomo Schneerson card.

01:39:58.784 --> 01:40:02.578
- It's the last of the series!
- You always talk about it.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:06.749
- It's in such good condition.
- It's mint. I had to get it.

01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:09.585
Brian!

01:40:13.215 --> 01:40:14.549
Thank you.

01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:16.926
You're welcome.

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:24.267
As pissed off as I was, the weird thing is

01:40:24.309 --> 01:40:28.771
I'm very sorry I didn't get
to see you two together.

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:32.108
That would have made me happy,
in a weird way.

01:40:32.234 --> 01:40:35.445
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:38.990
Things are really strange
between us now.

01:40:40.909 --> 01:40:43.911
Are you guys working this out?

01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:45.621
No, no.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:50.418
But that's offset by the fact
that I'm about to lose my job.

01:40:50.586 --> 01:40:52.170
Are you serious?

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.798
What a mess. I'm sorry.

01:40:58.469 --> 01:41:01.554
I was starting to think
I had a few things figured out.

01:41:01.638 --> 01:41:03.806
Yeah. Me, too.

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:05.892
What happened?

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:15.777
Hi.

01:41:16.987 --> 01:41:20.323
I don't think I'm the person
to offer objective advice

01:41:20.365 --> 01:41:22.617
on this particular confession.

01:41:23.702 --> 01:41:24.869
Brian!

01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:27.163
Brian.

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:33.753
You don't have to say anything.
Just listen to me.

01:41:33.837 --> 01:41:36.506
I'll just say one thing,
and then I will go away.

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:42.261
You're my friend,
and whatever else is going on,

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:48.684
I don't want you to think my feelings
for you relate to what I feel for Jake.

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:51.145
That's not the problem, and you know it.

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.819
I thought you wanted me

01:41:59.571 --> 01:42:01.531
and that affected me.

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:08.371
Maybe that's not fair and
I'm reading all kinds of things wrong,

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:11.374
but it sure felt that way to me.

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:21.467
I don't know what to say.

01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:29.559
I've just been having
so much fun, and...

01:42:31.854 --> 01:42:34.564
I've had all of these feelings lately,

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:39.110
and not just my feelings for Jake,
but this...

01:42:41.446 --> 01:42:45.616
Reconnecting with part of myself that
has been shut down for a long time.

01:42:47.077 --> 01:42:50.121
If I indulged those feelings with you,

01:42:50.205 --> 01:42:53.833
or if I took you for granted,
I am so sorry.

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:57.712
I can't bear that I hurt you.

01:43:01.466 --> 01:43:06.262
It's not your fault.
I totally set myself up for this.

01:43:08.265 --> 01:43:09.599
I'll tell you something,

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:12.768
I don't know which feels worse,
having my heart broken

01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:16.189
or doubting myself,
because of what that means for me.

01:43:16.273 --> 01:43:20.818
Don't you dare doubt yourself.
You have a gift, and you know it.

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:25.573
If you start doubting that because of me,
I don't know what I'd do to myself.

01:43:26.408 --> 01:43:28.117
I don't doubt myself because of you.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.622
I feel at my best when I'm around you,
and that makes me doubt everything.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:39.921
I don't know what to do, Brian.
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

01:43:59.942 --> 01:44:03.319
Is it me, or is confession getting
a little touchy-feely these days?

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.702
Thank you.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.040
The lights work, the cameras came
and the chairs are all set up.

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:20.211
I sent the invitations
and we've got the karaoke machine.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.756
Oh! No. We need the disks
for the karaoke.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.677
- I'll call Don at home.
- It's all right, I'll do it now.

01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:31.889
- Excuse me, what is that?
- A cell phone.

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.350
- Since when?
- Anna gave it to me. Look.

01:44:34.393 --> 01:44:38.521
She put God on speed dial. I called it,
it's the Elvis Presley museum.

01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:46.362
Sorry, I have to say this.
You know she's leaving next week?

01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:50.032
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, I'm just checking.

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:53.619
- You guys have been talking?
- Yeah. We had a good talk.

01:44:54.329 --> 01:44:55.871
- It's okay.
- Good.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.501
- Good.
- Sure you don't want to talk about this?

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:04.505
I don't! Am I asking you
to talk about it? I don't want to.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:07.008
- I'd talk about it if I wanted to.
- Okay.

01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:12.930
- It's just that she's leaving...
- I know, what do you want me to do?

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.310
Rabbi Schram.

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:19.895
What?

01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:23.607
- I'm looking for Ruth Schram.
- Dr. Marx.

01:45:24.067 --> 01:45:28.237
- What happened?
- She had a transient ischaemic attack.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.241
- A what?
- It's an "almost" stroke.

01:45:32.284 --> 01:45:34.368
What does that mean?

01:45:34.411 --> 01:45:36.912
- A blockage of blood...
- Is she all right?

01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:40.416
Bring me my Obsession perfume,
some macaroons,

01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:43.586
and my computer, I gotta e-mail.

01:45:43.628 --> 01:45:47.340
Mom, the doctor said
you must rest for two days...

01:45:47.424 --> 01:45:48.758
Get out of here!

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:52.845
If I have to stay here for two days,
I'll give them an ischaemic... Whatever.

01:45:57.601 --> 01:46:01.604
I assume your brother
knows all about this?

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:06.942
Yeah, he's stuck in the Hamptons,
but he's checking in...

01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:11.781
Yeah. Okay, doesn't matter,
I'll be home by tomorrow.

01:46:11.948 --> 01:46:14.200
Thanks for being so dutiful.

01:46:14.284 --> 01:46:16.118
It's our pleasure.

01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:20.247
Where's the third musketeer?
Miss Reilly? Working hard?

01:46:25.087 --> 01:46:29.298
- What?
- You know what, I need a coffee.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:34.303
- I'll get it.
- No, that's okay. You stay and talk.

01:46:38.016 --> 01:46:41.644
- What happened?
- I don't want you to worry about this.

01:46:41.686 --> 01:46:45.648
- It's fine, I've dealt with it.
- Dealt with what? How?

01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:48.984
I dealt with it. It's over, and I don't...

01:46:49.027 --> 01:46:50.903
- I wanna talk about this.
- No.

01:46:50.987 --> 01:46:53.614
- I wanna talk!
- You should rest!

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:57.493
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Yes, there is.

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.998
Sit back, relax.

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:04.834
Listen to me.

01:47:04.876 --> 01:47:06.516
There's a reason your brother isn't here.

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:10.047
I know. And I'm not going to let
that happen again.

01:47:10.132 --> 01:47:11.966
You don't know!

01:47:16.346 --> 01:47:18.389
I made a mistake.

01:47:23.478 --> 01:47:28.232
It's true, he's punishing me a little
too much for it, but it was my fault.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.531
It's hard to see your son as a man.

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:41.370
I couldn't do that for him.

01:47:43.373 --> 01:47:47.543
You're a man, Jake, a good man.
I did a good job with you.

01:47:51.506 --> 01:47:54.467
Make your own decisions
about what's important to you.

01:47:55.969 --> 01:47:58.137
I'm proud of you, no matter what.

01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:00.097
Mom...

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:04.185
I love you.

01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:08.772
Thank you.

01:48:42.432 --> 01:48:43.599
Rabbi.

01:48:48.104 --> 01:48:52.441
- How's your mother, Jake?
- Good. She's here tonight.

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:57.029
That's wonderful. I suppose you
have your speech all prepared?

01:48:57.113 --> 01:49:00.741
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:03.285
And you'll go out with a bang?

01:49:38.029 --> 01:49:39.238
Shalom.

01:49:45.996 --> 01:49:52.418
Since Yom Kippur is the Super Bowl
of the Jewish calendar,

01:49:52.502 --> 01:49:58.716
most rabbis try to cram
a whole year's worth of sermons

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.302
into one big, best-of sermon.

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:05.014
I'm not going to do that tonight.

01:50:05.348 --> 01:50:08.267
I won't talk about the meaning of God

01:50:09.394 --> 01:50:13.439
or the situation in Israel
or the status of Jews around the world.

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.400
I'd like to talk about
something more personal.

01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:22.364
I'd like to talk about us,
the status of you and me.

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:31.206
A wise man once told me
that no rabbi can save anyone,

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:36.462
he can only offer himself
as a guide to other fearful people.

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.301
We live in a really complex world.

01:50:42.385 --> 01:50:47.431
A world where boundaries and
definitions are blurring into each other

01:50:47.515 --> 01:50:52.394
in ways that challenge us, not just
as Jews, but as human beings.

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:57.941
For a while now, you've let me
be your guide.

01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:02.905
You've shared your lives with me,

01:51:04.449 --> 01:51:07.034
you've explored your faith with me

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:12.414
in ways that, I know, sometimes have
seemed strange and even scary.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:15.876
But you put your trust in me.

01:51:16.711 --> 01:51:20.130
And, over the past few months,

01:51:20.215 --> 01:51:22.591
I have been violating that trust.

01:51:24.094 --> 01:51:27.846
I've been violating it
by not sharing my life with you.

01:51:30.433 --> 01:51:33.644
For a number of months, I've been
seeing a woman who isn't Jewish.

01:51:38.316 --> 01:51:42.653
It doesn't matter if I'm still with her,
or if I still love her, which I do.

01:51:42.737 --> 01:51:47.366
What matters is that I shouldn't have
been afraid to discuss it with you.

01:51:51.663 --> 01:51:53.872
I'm not sorry for loving her.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.379
I am sorry, I'm very sorry,
that I put too little faith in you.

01:52:06.136 --> 01:52:08.637
Yom Kippur is the day of atonement,

01:52:10.932 --> 01:52:12.558
and so tonight,

01:52:14.269 --> 01:52:18.689
I stand before you
and ask you to forgive me.

01:52:38.084 --> 01:52:43.964
This could take a while. Go home.
I'll call when the board has decided.

01:52:47.886 --> 01:52:50.220
Or you could stick around. Okay?

01:53:15.538 --> 01:53:17.164
Come on. Come on!

01:53:18.708 --> 01:53:20.709
- Yes? Yes!
- Yes!

01:53:22.712 --> 01:53:24.463
Don't mess with me like that!

01:53:28.384 --> 01:53:31.553
This is so fantastic. How does it feel?

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.180
It feels good.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:37.893
We've got a lot to celebrate tonight,
barring an interfaith rumble!

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:41.647
- It's definitely Manischewitz time.
- We have two cases.

01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:46.318
- Did you get the disks from Don?
- No, I'm going to, don't worry.

01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:50.364
Not to rain on your parade,
but I had to say goodbye to Anna.

01:53:51.407 --> 01:53:54.117
I know you don't want
to talk about it, but there it is.

01:53:54.202 --> 01:53:56.703
There what is?
Come on, man, what are you doing?

01:53:56.746 --> 01:53:58.831
What do you want me to do?
Flagellate myself?

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:01.959
Jews don't do that. We plant trees.

01:54:02.043 --> 01:54:06.797
Who's talking about feeling guilty?
I thought you'd wanna do something.

01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:11.134
You're on such a roll right now.
What's holding you back?

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:15.514
- You love her, don't you?
- Yes, I do, I just...

01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:20.686
- Sometimes that's not enough.
- Listen to what you're saying!

01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:24.982
Not enough? There's nothing else
that's worth anything against that.

01:54:25.775 --> 01:54:30.904
For years you've talked about how
much you want something like this,

01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:35.284
and when it comes, you walk away
over a few minor complications.

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:39.621
What kind of plan is that?
You know how God works.

01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:45.335
Think He'll give you this a second
time 'cause you're on his crew?

01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:47.796
Seriously, look at me.

01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:52.467
As your friend, I'm telling you,
you're making this too complicated.

01:54:53.344 --> 01:54:58.974
It's very simple. You love each other,
and she's leaving in two hours!

01:54:59.809 --> 01:55:03.854
You need to ask yourself,
are you going to do anything or not?

01:55:08.818 --> 01:55:10.193
Why are you standing here?

01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:15.157
- You're right! Why am I standing here?
- The sign hasn't changed.

01:55:16.117 --> 01:55:18.785
This is New York City!
Who waits for a sign?

01:55:18.828 --> 01:55:19.953
Cross the damn street!

01:55:19.996 --> 01:55:23.290
Do we need signs to tell us
what to do? Cross the street!

01:55:23.333 --> 01:55:26.293
- I gotta go!
- Go, yes, go!

01:55:26.336 --> 01:55:29.046
- Brian, thank you!
- What happened to free will?

01:55:31.174 --> 01:55:33.926
Go! Go forth and prosper!

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:44.144
- Sir, may I help you?
- T-Bone, I gotta see Anna.

01:55:58.242 --> 01:56:00.452
I'm sorry, there's no answer.

01:56:00.578 --> 01:56:04.539
T-Bone, look at me.
Don't you recognize me? It's Jake.

01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:09.169
- What is this in reference to?
- It's not in reference to anything!

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:12.923
Do me a favor.
This is very important to me.

01:56:13.007 --> 01:56:16.843
Go and tell anybody
that Jake Schram is here, okay?

01:56:16.928 --> 01:56:19.721
- I can't do that, sir.
- Help me out!

01:56:19.764 --> 01:56:22.474
Come on, just two guys, T.

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:28.355
- Take me with you.
- I don't know where I'm going yet.

01:56:28.564 --> 01:56:29.982
What's that?

01:56:30.233 --> 01:56:34.736
You're going to San Francisco
to lead the exciting life.

01:56:34.904 --> 01:56:38.490
Don't tell anybody, but I need
a break from this exciting life.

01:56:39.534 --> 01:56:41.535
- Really?
- Yeah, I do.

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:44.287
So, what are you packing there,
something like 280, 290?

01:56:45.748 --> 01:56:47.708
- 320.
- Oh, 320.

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:08.562
Okay, okay... All right!

01:57:08.604 --> 01:57:11.690
Next time, sir, I suggest
you make an appointment.

01:57:26.622 --> 01:57:30.959
No, seriously, a toast. To Anna.

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:33.587
- To Anna.
- Hear, hear.

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:37.758
- Thank you. I'll miss you guys.
- Yeah, right!

01:57:38.092 --> 01:57:41.261
I'm going to miss a lot of things
around here,

01:57:41.304 --> 01:57:44.890
like Len's endless
Howard Stern recountings.

01:57:45.016 --> 01:57:48.310
And, of course, I'll miss
my Casanova boy across the way.

01:57:49.145 --> 01:57:51.021
- Hey, what is that?
- What?

01:57:52.607 --> 01:57:55.984
- Oh, my God.
- Who is that?

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.739
- It's Jake.
- What's he doing?

01:58:00.823 --> 01:58:02.074
I don't know.

01:58:02.158 --> 01:58:03.450
Pick up the phone!

01:58:05.453 --> 01:58:09.706
- Anna Reilly.
- Anna, it's Jake. Can you see me?

01:58:09.791 --> 01:58:12.667
I can only see my reflection.

01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:15.087
I see you, what are you doing?

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:19.382
I tried to get up there, but it's like
the Pentagon with that T-Bone.

01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:22.803
I decided to try Casanova here.
His name's Howard.

01:58:23.012 --> 01:58:25.639
I've been thinking about some things,
I'd like to talk to you.

01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:31.061
- Am I on speakerphone?
- Hi, Jake!

01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:34.606
- Hi.
- Go on.

01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:39.611
- Can we talk? Can I come over?
- No, now is a good time.

01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:43.365
Okay. All right.

01:58:43.866 --> 01:58:49.412
Listen, I've been thinking...
I just want you to know I'm sorry.

01:58:49.497 --> 01:58:52.457
- And you were right.
- About what?

01:58:52.542 --> 01:58:56.378
About everything. About us,
about me, especially about me.

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:59.631
- I acted like an idiot.
- What are you saying?

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:02.134
Yeah, what are you saying, Jake?

01:59:03.678 --> 01:59:05.762
I'm saying that I love you.

01:59:08.015 --> 01:59:09.516
I'm in love with you.

01:59:10.893 --> 01:59:14.813
I've waited all my life for someone
like you, and I won't let you go.

01:59:16.858 --> 01:59:20.402
Please, don't go.
Anna, I don't want you to go.

01:59:23.573 --> 01:59:25.907
Could we get off the phone?

01:59:27.702 --> 01:59:30.245
Hello? What's going on? Anna?

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:32.164
- She's gone, buddy. Move!
- What?

01:59:39.088 --> 01:59:43.258
- Stuff like that never happens to me.
- Me, neither.

02:00:03.571 --> 02:00:06.823
No jokes, no surprises

02:00:08.618 --> 02:00:14.956
No crisis arises
My life goes along as it should

02:00:15.333 --> 02:00:21.296
It's all very nice but not very good

02:00:22.465 --> 02:00:29.387
And I'm ready to take a chance again

02:00:30.473 --> 02:00:36.645
Ready to put my love
on the line with you

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:42.442
Living with nothing to show for it

02:00:42.777 --> 02:00:46.947
You get what you get
when you go for it

02:00:47.156 --> 02:00:52.160
And I'm ready to take a chance again

02:00:52.328 --> 02:00:58.875
Ready to put my love
on the line with you

02:00:59.001 --> 02:01:03.255
Than living with nothing to show for it

02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:07.759
You get what you get
when you go for it

02:01:09.011 --> 02:01:10.178
Hey!

02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:14.140
- Everything okay here?
- All good things.

02:01:14.183 --> 02:01:15.809
All good things.

02:01:17.061 --> 02:01:23.149
With you
I'm ready to take that chance again

02:01:23.192 --> 02:01:24.276
Hi.

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:28.697
Rabbi Lewis. Anna, this is Rabbi Lewis.

02:01:28.864 --> 02:01:31.866
- Good to see you again.
- And you, Rabbi.

02:01:31.993 --> 02:01:35.328
- You missed our last class.
- I thought I was leaving town.

02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:41.710
- Don't look at me like that.
- I'd love to start again.

02:01:41.919 --> 02:01:44.170
- I'd be delighted.
- Anna...

02:01:46.299 --> 02:01:49.050
If you'll excuse us, we're off dancing.

02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.721
- Come on, let's get this started.
- Okay.

02:01:56.684 --> 02:02:00.061
Attention, please.
We'd like to kick this off.

02:02:00.438 --> 02:02:03.023
So great to see such a great turn-out.

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:07.110
- Thank you for coming.
- Congratulations.

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:10.807
It's wonderful to see so much
interfaith dancing happening.

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:15.535
Like the end of West Side Story
warms the heart.

02:02:16.412 --> 02:02:19.998
- Let's give ourselves a hand.
- This is your place. Enjoy it.

02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:21.833
Hit it.

02:02:36.349 --> 02:02:37.932
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:02:41.729 --> 02:02:45.315
- Is three a crowd here?
- Not this three.

02:02:47.818 --> 02:02:49.152
Hold it!

02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:23.103
Do you want to know

02:03:23.771 --> 02:03:30.151
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:36.533
I see in your hair?
I feel it could be there

02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:41.454
Somehow tonight

02:03:43.833 --> 02:03:46.251
And do you want to find

02:03:46.502 --> 02:03:52.674
Something worth saving?
The change would do me right

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:58.596
'Cause I've been just waiting
and hesitating

02:03:58.681 --> 02:04:02.642
With this heart

02:04:02.685 --> 02:04:03.185
of mine

02:04:12.778 --> 02:04:15.029
You're still a mystery

02:04:15.364 --> 02:04:21.703
But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

02:04:22.663 --> 02:04:27.584
I feel completed
Like it's something I needed

02:04:27.751 --> 02:04:30.128
For this heart

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:32.297
of mine

02:04:42.266 --> 02:04:45.101
There's always something so tragic

02:04:48.731 --> 02:04:52.484
About a hopeless romantic

02:05:10.461 --> 02:05:12.587
So though we cannot know

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:19.427
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

02:05:20.262 --> 02:05:26.184
I'm through with waiting and hesitating

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.561
I want you taking

02:05:28.938 --> 02:05:31.648
This heart

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:33.525
of mine

02:05:42.284 --> 02:05:49.290
Heart of mine

02:05:50.305 --> 02:05:56.440
