- [groans]

00:10.367 --> 00:12.833
[tense music]

00:12.867 --> 00:15.333
- We successfully captured
a key Red Hand operative.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.233
[electric crackling]
- [screaming]

00:17.267 --> 00:19.200
- Yet before we could extract
any useful intelligence...

00:19.233 --> 00:21.033
- No, no, come on.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.533
- She managed to kill herself
while in our custody.

00:22.567 --> 00:24.033
- Come on.
- What is it?

00:24.067 --> 00:26.333
- It's our chance
to change everything.

00:26.367 --> 00:29.400
[loud explosion]

00:32.033 --> 00:33.833
- A sensitive file
was downloaded

00:33.867 --> 00:35.300
from my office computer.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.167
- The other information
on that flash drive,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.133
it matched something else
we've been working on.

00:39.167 --> 00:41.200
This isn't a colony.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.933
It's a death camp.

00:55.567 --> 00:56.967
[door opening]

00:57.000 --> 00:59.833
- Proxy Alcala is here, ma'am.

00:59.867 --> 01:01.900
- You're late.
- My apologies.

01:01.933 --> 01:04.200
The traffic.
[chuckles]

01:04.233 --> 01:08.300
Proxy Fleming, Proxy Lee,
what did I miss?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.867
- Helena was just bringing us
up to date

01:09.900 --> 01:11.267
on last night's explosion.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.233
- It was an automated
transport ship.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.200
None of our Hosts were harmed.

01:16.233 --> 01:19.367
- Can we say that
this was an act of sabotage?

01:19.400 --> 01:23.267
- Yes, and since virtually
all of the supplies on the ship

01:23.300 --> 01:25.233
passed through our
processing and labor camps--

01:25.267 --> 01:27.933
- It's not our fault.
They can't possibly blame us.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.867
- They have blamed us for less.

01:29.900 --> 01:33.233
In the meantime, we need
to continue to do our jobs,

01:33.267 --> 01:36.067
which is to maintain order
in this Colony.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.767
- That's what I wanted
to talk about.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.967
Everyone in my bloc
saw the explosion,

01:40.067 --> 01:41.967
and I'm sure the Resistance
will try to claim it

01:42.067 --> 01:43.600
for propaganda purposes.

01:43.633 --> 01:46.600
I suggest we get ahead of it.

01:46.633 --> 01:50.067
The Greatest Day is gaining
real momentum in my bloc.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.367
With the right spin,
the public will believe

01:52.400 --> 01:54.833
that this event was intentional.

01:56.333 --> 02:00.600
- We can't push this
Greatest Day thing too hard.

02:00.633 --> 02:03.300
The people still need to respect
the civilian Authority.

02:03.333 --> 02:07.600
- It would be a mistake
to let a crisis go to waste.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.933
- The nature of their response
is out of our hands.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.933
Let's just ensure that
any decisions we make now

02:15.967 --> 02:17.333
won't come back to haunt us.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.500
Understand?

02:19.533 --> 02:21.500
- Of course.

02:21.533 --> 02:26.267
My fellow citizens,
we all saw something...

02:26.300 --> 02:28.467
remarkable last night.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.633
Now, I know that there are
a lot of rumors

02:30.667 --> 02:32.600
going around our bloc.

02:32.633 --> 02:36.933
What you witnessed was the test
of a technology

02:36.967 --> 02:38.633
that you have never seen
before,

02:38.667 --> 02:43.133
one capable
of inter-dimensional travel.

02:43.167 --> 02:47.467
All in preparation
for the Greatest Day.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.467
I understand the hardships
that all of you...

02:51.500 --> 02:52.833
- Asshole.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.933
- They're holding for you.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.533

- [laughs]

[indistinct radio chatter]

04:27.833 --> 04:29.500
What happened?

04:29.533 --> 04:32.167
- Someone left a loose end
at the safe house yesterday.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.233
- Once again,
I find myself asking

04:34.267 --> 04:36.400
how this could have happened.

04:36.433 --> 04:39.433
- Once we secured the perimeter,
the cordon moved inside.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.067
No one was covering the back.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.133
- This Red Hand is a dangerous
group of anarchists,

04:45.167 --> 04:48.967
part of a toxic ideology that
threatens order in our bloc.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.467
The more they continue
to propagate,

04:50.500 --> 04:52.567
the more impotent
we're going to appear.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.433
- Do we know where this kid is?

04:54.467 --> 04:56.400
- The surveillance pool
is working overtime.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.833
Every eye we have is looking
for Mr. Emmett Hallstead.

04:58.867 --> 05:00.533
- Give me one day,
Mr. Bennett,

05:00.567 --> 05:03.200
without anything
getting in my way,

05:03.233 --> 05:06.233
and I will bring him in.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.367
- I've already seen
what this partnership

05:08.400 --> 05:10.633
is capable of together.

05:10.667 --> 05:14.300
I want to see how you operate
on your own.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.167
Detective Burke, you will
oversee the surveillance

05:17.200 --> 05:19.500
operation as we look for
Mr. Hallstead.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.700
Detective Bowman, you will
return to the safe house

05:22.733 --> 05:25.467
and find whatever it is you
missed the first time around.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.867
- Why am I the one
being sidelined?

05:26.900 --> 05:28.533
- There is no sideline.

05:28.567 --> 05:32.300
I'm just waiting for one of you
to do something useful.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.300
[ominous music]

05:35.333 --> 05:42.367

06:05.467 --> 06:07.967
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.367
You make any progress
on that file?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.533
- Yeah.

06:11.567 --> 06:12.967
- I feel like I'm putting
together slides

06:13.067 --> 06:15.533
for the most depressing
TED Talk ever.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.100
"So You're Going Extinct."

06:17.133 --> 06:18.867
- It's a powerful message.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.900
Should inspire more people
to join the fight.

06:20.933 --> 06:23.167
- It worked on me.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.467
- Well, does that mean
you're gonna be moving into

06:26.500 --> 06:27.700
our lovely little flat?

06:27.733 --> 06:30.233
- Will's in trouble.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.700
His team raided one of
the Red Hand's safe houses.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.367
Will found a kid hiding inside,
helped him escape.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.767
But now they're out looking
for the kid.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.533
- All right,
so let me get this right.

06:38.567 --> 06:41.300
You sabotage our operation with
the the RAP and quit the group,

06:41.333 --> 06:42.800
yet when you need help,

06:42.833 --> 06:44.633
we're supposed to pretend
it didn't happen?

06:47.267 --> 06:50.233
- I am the reason you escaped
the Occupation.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.100
And I helped you with BB.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.833
- Yeah, that worked great.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.833
- We'll go to Hennessey
and tell him about the kid.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.167
- Whoa.
Why are you taking the gauntlet?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.500
- Hennessey's gonna hold
onto it.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.167
- Who decided that?
- I did.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.100
- Don't you think we should talk
about this?

07:06.133 --> 07:07.933
- We're under a lot of heat,
and it's not doing any good

07:07.967 --> 07:09.600
sitting in a box down here.

07:09.633 --> 07:10.933
- That's the only thing we have.
We've been--

07:10.967 --> 07:14.500
- It's the right play.

Repeat: a load down
in sectors 1-5.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.567

08:03.367 --> 08:06.833
Clean it up.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.933
Not a trace.
- Yes, sir.

08:29.700 --> 08:33.333
- Do you remember when my--
my mum came to visit?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.933
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.567
I think I traumatized her
by taking her

08:38.600 --> 08:40.400
to that Ethiopian place.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.500
- She liked you, you know.

08:43.533 --> 08:46.833
She always wondered why we...

08:46.867 --> 08:49.233
we couldn't make it work.

08:52.367 --> 08:56.233
I, uh,
have to show you something.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.900
- Where did you get this?

09:10.933 --> 09:13.233
- They're posted
all over the city.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.800
- Did you call this number?

09:16.833 --> 09:18.333
- I did.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.633
They have her.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.500
- I--wait.
Your mother's in England.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.233
I thought your mother
was in England.

09:25.267 --> 09:28.067
- Yeah, they--they work for
some intelligence unit

09:28.067 --> 09:29.600
outside the Colony.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.133
- Oh, Jesus, Simon.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.533
- This is our chance to get out.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.633
We didn't sign up for this.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.933
We'll just--we'll just say
we got in too deep,

09:47.967 --> 09:50.467
that we didn't know
what we were doing.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.733
- You really think
they'll buy that?

09:56.767 --> 09:58.767
- All they want is the gauntlet.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.133
That's why we have to act now
before Hennessey goes

10:01.167 --> 10:02.633
and does something with it.

10:02.667 --> 10:06.367
Morgan,
we have to cut our losses.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.100
- How can...

10:14.133 --> 10:16.233
how can we trust them?

10:16.267 --> 10:19.367
- Well, if we stay in this bloc,
we're dead anyway.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.033
- Okay.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.467
What do we have to do?

10:36.500 --> 10:39.467
- We need to give them
Broussard.

10:58.233 --> 10:58.433

10:58.467 --> 10:59.000
- I have to say, Mr. Bowman,

11:01.667 --> 11:03.867
I didn't think you had it
in you.

11:06.067 --> 11:09.467
I'm curious whether
when you stole my keycard

11:09.500 --> 11:12.233
to help your attractive,
fanatical girlfriend

11:12.267 --> 11:13.800
you thought about
the consequences

11:13.833 --> 11:16.167
to not only yourself
but every other person

11:16.200 --> 11:17.667
in this place.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.767
Today I'm not the prison warden

11:23.800 --> 11:25.767
who's gonna threaten you
with punishment.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.933
Today I'm just a fellow inmate.

11:27.967 --> 11:31.100
And I'm telling you
that you just signed

11:31.133 --> 11:35.333
your own death warrant and mine

11:35.367 --> 11:37.967
and every other soul
in this camp.

11:38.067 --> 11:41.567
Because the RAPs do not care who
wears what uniform down here.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.100
When something like this
happens,

11:43.133 --> 11:45.700
we all burn.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.467
Unless, of course,
it never happened.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.600
If there's no evidence at all
that your friend's little

11:59.633 --> 12:03.300
gunpowder plot originated here,
then it didn't happen.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.167
And if it didn't happen,

12:05.200 --> 12:08.367
then maybe we all get to live
another day.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.233
Of course, that would mean that
there can be no contradicting

12:12.267 --> 12:14.667
evidence left behind,
anything or anyone

12:14.700 --> 12:16.500
that could upset
the delicate narrative

12:16.533 --> 12:19.733
that you and I are establishing.

12:19.767 --> 12:23.067
Which means that I need you

12:23.067 --> 12:26.100
to provide me with names.

12:28.567 --> 12:30.533
- So you can have
more people killed?

12:33.367 --> 12:34.667
- I'm sorry.

12:34.700 --> 12:38.367
Was I,
in my state of utter distress,

12:38.400 --> 12:41.300
babbling in tongues?

12:41.333 --> 12:44.367
Your friends are already dead!

12:48.400 --> 12:52.067
This is damage control.

12:52.067 --> 12:55.967
Either some of us die,

12:56.067 --> 12:58.467
or all of us do.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.467

might be living here,

she left home.

I haven't--I mean, I haven't
heard from her in months, and...

14:50.867 --> 14:55.133
but then one of her friends said
that he heard that she was here,

14:55.167 --> 14:57.433

14:58.900 --> 15:00.900
if you know where she is,

please just tell me.

- I'm sorry.
She didn't make it.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.933
- [sobbing]
Oh, my God.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.933
She's dead.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.367
I wanted to know where she was.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.767
I--I thought that I did.

16:00.933 --> 16:05.233
- I was separated from my son
during the invasion.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.967
He was gone for over a year.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.067
Not knowing was--
- I should've--

16:11.100 --> 16:13.733
I should've kept her closer.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.100
- It's not your fault.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.900
She got involved
with a powerful cult.

16:22.933 --> 16:24.967
- No.
Cults prey on the weak.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.700
And my daughter was strong.

16:30.933 --> 16:32.700
- You're right.
She was.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.700
- Were--were you there when...

16:41.767 --> 16:43.267
I have to know.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.300
If someone could have told you
about your son,

16:46.333 --> 16:48.400
even if the news was terrible,

16:48.433 --> 16:51.133
wouldn't you have wanted
to know?

16:51.167 --> 16:55.300
- I tried to save her.
- You tried to save her?

16:55.333 --> 16:58.067
[shouts]
You tried.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.667
The RAPs don't even have to
kill us anymore,

17:02.700 --> 17:04.900
because we're all down here
lining up

17:04.933 --> 17:07.367
to do their work for them.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.300
And now I'm gonna go
to the factory

17:14.333 --> 17:16.300
just for being Frankie's mother,

17:16.333 --> 17:19.400
because that's what
you people do.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.067
- Not all of us.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.867
- Oh, God.

17:44.567 --> 17:45.833
- This place is a dead end.

17:45.867 --> 17:48.633
Take me back to HQ.
- Yes, sir.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.467
[knocking]

17:51.500 --> 17:53.533
- Hey.
- This is Hennessey.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.200
Katie, the one I told you about.

17:55.233 --> 17:59.800
- Always happy to meet a member
of the extended family.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.633
Is that the thing?

18:01.667 --> 18:05.067
I will take good care of it.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.300
What's this?
- Doomsday clock.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.633
It's an analysis of classified
census data

18:09.667 --> 18:11.267
from around the colony.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.900
A little over 27 months
from now,

18:12.933 --> 18:16.200
the population in the city
will be reduced to 2.5%

18:16.233 --> 18:19.200
[dramatic music]

18:19.233 --> 18:22.700
*

18:22.733 --> 18:27.833
- These were strewn
all over the bloc this morning.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.533
- Is that even possible?

18:33.567 --> 18:35.300
- Maybe, maybe not.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.933
Either way, you've got to admire
the balls on 'em.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.767
- Are you in touch with them?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.800
- Not for lack of trying.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.933
- The Occupation is looking for
one of their gophers.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.400
We could warn them.
It might be a way in.

18:47.433 --> 18:51.300
- And why are we suddenly
so eager to find an in?

18:51.333 --> 18:53.267
- Her husband, Will.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.767
- The collaborator.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.433
- He let a kid go during a raid.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.100
The Occupation sniffed it out.

18:58.133 --> 19:02.067
They find the kid and break him,
it'll be bad for Will.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.267
- I just don't see why
that would be bad for me.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.467
No offense.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.967
- My husband has been valuable
to the cause.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.933
Refuse to help him
and you're cutting off one of

19:14.967 --> 19:17.667
your best sources
inside the Occupation.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.800
- The name of the kid
who escaped the safe house

19:28.833 --> 19:30.767
is Emmett Hallstead.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.067
- How do you know that?

19:33.067 --> 19:36.667
- Because he came here
last night asking me for help.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.667
- He didn't go back
to the Red Hand?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.133
- They're the ones
he's running from.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.933
He's terrified of them.

19:41.967 --> 19:45.067
Says they're gonna kill him
just to tie up loose ends.

19:46.067 --> 19:49.500
Yeah, shades of ISIS, man.

19:49.533 --> 19:53.600
I put him in a safe house
until things cool down.

19:53.633 --> 19:56.167
Whether or not he stays put...

20:01.800 --> 20:04.767
[tense music]

20:04.800 --> 20:10.167
*

20:18.167 --> 20:21.067
- You have all been very stupid.

20:23.733 --> 20:25.333
[gunshot]

20:25.367 --> 20:27.433
- [muffled scream]

20:27.467 --> 20:28.833
[muffled] What are you doing?
What are you doing?

20:28.867 --> 20:30.133
- Ungag him.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.467
- [muffled]
What are you doing?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.767
What are you doing?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.867
Augh, ahh, wait.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.500
Wait. Wait a minute. Stop.
I was lying.

20:36.533 --> 20:38.467
I was lying.
I was lying.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.600
You wanted names,
so I gave you names, okay?

20:40.633 --> 20:41.967
- That's what I've been
wondering.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.200
Should I really trust this kid?

20:44.233 --> 20:47.267
Or is he using my empathy
against me?

20:49.667 --> 20:52.533
[gunshot]
- [screams]

20:52.567 --> 20:55.100
- I'm not playing a game, Bram.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.267
My life is at stake.

20:57.300 --> 21:01.767
Lots of lives are at stake,
so I need the truth.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.900
All of it.

21:03.933 --> 21:06.900
[tense music]

21:06.933 --> 21:12.833
*

21:12.867 --> 21:14.867
- No, don't, don't, don't.
He didn't do anything.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.333
I swear to God he didn't
do anything. Please don't.

21:16.367 --> 21:19.100
[gunshot]
Ohh.

21:21.433 --> 21:22.567
- Was anyone else involved?

21:22.600 --> 21:25.067
- [sobbing]
No.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.700
- You've just been lying to me.
Why should I believe you now?

21:27.733 --> 21:31.333
- [sobbing]
I want to go home.

21:31.367 --> 21:34.233
- You're a loose end.

21:34.267 --> 21:37.067
Was anyone else involved?

21:37.067 --> 21:38.633
- No!

21:44.967 --> 21:46.633
- Let him go.

21:51.467 --> 21:54.500
The kids in that dumpster,

21:54.533 --> 21:57.500
we killed them,
you and me.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.567
But we did it so that
everyone else can live.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.933
The way you can honor
their sacrifice

22:02.967 --> 22:07.733
is by keeping your mouth shut.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.100
Forever.

22:09.133 --> 22:16.167
*

22:30.700 --> 22:30.900

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

22:53.300 --> 22:54.833
[tennis ball thumping]

22:54.867 --> 22:56.333
Welcome, friends.

22:56.367 --> 22:59.467
We gather here to celebrate
another passing day

22:59.500 --> 23:01.233
and with it one more step
on our journey.

23:01.267 --> 23:03.467
- Please stop that, Charlie.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.800
- The time has come
to make preparations,

23:06.833 --> 23:10.833
to set aside earthly concerns
and give ourselves over...

23:10.867 --> 23:13.200
- Charlie, stop it.

23:13.233 --> 23:16.333
- The Greatest day
will be upon us

23:16.367 --> 23:18.900
and we who have been
enlightened,

23:18.933 --> 23:22.367
who honor our Hosts
with our patience and obedience

23:22.400 --> 23:24.333
will be lifted up
into their glory.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.067
- This is a sacred place.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.700
- No, it's not.

23:27.733 --> 23:31.167
- You know, if you actually
paid attention for once,

23:31.200 --> 23:32.800
you might learn something.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.567
- I don't want to learn
this stuff; it's stupid.

23:39.233 --> 23:42.867
- All I have to do is tell
one of the elders

23:42.900 --> 23:46.167
that I've been looking after
a boy who is violent,

23:46.200 --> 23:49.867
destructive,
and completely without remorse,

23:49.900 --> 23:52.400
and that I have identified him
as a candidate

23:52.433 --> 23:55.833
for focused restoration.

23:55.867 --> 24:00.233
And in just a few seconds,
they will pull you out of sight,

24:00.267 --> 24:04.067
and you will never see
your family again.

24:04.100 --> 24:07.200
Is that what you want,
Charlie?

24:07.233 --> 24:10.200
[dark music]

24:10.233 --> 24:13.900
*

24:13.933 --> 24:16.267
Good.

24:16.300 --> 24:20.367
- And is now nearly upon us,
but only...

24:20.400 --> 24:23.433
[indistinct speech
over speakers]

24:33.900 --> 24:36.767
- Sir, found him.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.633
This is Westlake and 6th
looking north

24:42.667 --> 24:45.300
from 6:21 a.m. this morning.

24:50.567 --> 24:53.533
[tense music]

24:53.567 --> 25:00.667

You're clear.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.600
[knocking]

25:27.633 --> 25:29.167
- Who's there?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.733
- Your friend Hennessey
wants me to move you.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.067
- Who are you?
- My name is Elise.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.467
And you're not safe here.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.900
- No shit, lady.
- I'm here to help.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.467
I have him.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.933
- Wait. Who is that?

25:52.967 --> 25:54.667
- That's just my backup,
sweetheart.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.100
- I'm not going anywhere
unless I speak to Hennessey.

25:56.133 --> 25:57.600
- The Occupation
is looking for you,

25:57.633 --> 25:58.600
and we don't have time.

25:58.633 --> 26:01.200
- Shit.

26:01.233 --> 26:02.667
I can't go out there.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.267
- Why didn't you just go back
to your cell?

26:04.300 --> 26:06.067
- I was the only one who escaped
that raid.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.867
They'd never believe
that I didn't talk.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.067
They'll kill me
just to make sure.

26:10.067 --> 26:11.600
- Katie,
we've got company.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.500

- Redhats.

the building.

out of there right now.

Get to the east side
of the building

27:23.333 --> 27:27.067
where we came in.

Okay, listen to me.

always good to see you.

hmm?

28:47.500 --> 28:49.067
Get in the car.
- Excuse me?

28:49.067 --> 28:50.667
- There's a meeting
back at the Colony.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.167
I'll explain along the way.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.833
- If this is about the incident
last night,

28:53.867 --> 28:55.467
I assure you it didn't come
from my camp.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.067
You're welcome to search
the grounds.

28:57.067 --> 28:58.300
We don't have anything
to hide here.

28:58.333 --> 29:01.933
- It's already been decided.

29:01.967 --> 29:03.600
- I took care of everything.

29:03.633 --> 29:04.833
The Hosts could scan
this camp themselves.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.500
They wouldn't find anything.

29:06.533 --> 29:09.200
- It doesn't matter, Alan.
You need to get in the car.

29:09.233 --> 29:10.667
- I'm not getting in the car.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.100

Six-one-four-nine.
Let's go.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.067
Go, go, go, come on.

29:33.067 --> 29:34.833
- Get off me.
What are you doing?

29:34.867 --> 29:36.667

glass shattering]

30:14.533 --> 30:17.567
[indistinct chatter]

30:25.967 --> 30:29.067
- Look at that. I didn't even
need the whole day.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.733
- Like I said,
I was just a spotter.

30:31.767 --> 30:34.033
I'll tell you whatever.

30:34.067 --> 30:36.767
Please,
you just have to protect me.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.167
- Protect you from whom?
- Them.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.767
They'll kill me if they know
I've even talked to you.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.367
- They won't touch you
inside here, son.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.733
You have my word on that.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.900
- So you won't send me
to the Factory?

30:49.933 --> 30:53.600
- That depends on how much
you can help me.

30:55.633 --> 30:57.333
- What do you want to know?

30:57.367 --> 31:00.400
- How did you escape
the safe house?

31:05.833 --> 31:08.633
- I hid in a crawl space.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.533
They never searched it.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.100
- Who recruited you?

31:14.133 --> 31:15.267
- Frankie.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.567
- Frankie Brun?

31:16.600 --> 31:19.467
How did she recruit you?

31:25.433 --> 31:29.300
- She said she loved me.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.900
I'd never been
with a girl before.

31:33.633 --> 31:37.167
- Did you ever have contact
with the leader of the cell?

31:41.867 --> 31:43.233
- Yes.

31:43.267 --> 31:45.600
- Who is he?

31:45.633 --> 31:47.133
- She.

31:48.633 --> 31:51.800
Her name is Karen.

31:51.833 --> 31:53.300
Frankie's mother.

33:13.733 --> 33:16.067
- Hey.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.167
- They found the kid.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.067
- Yeah, I know.

33:33.233 --> 33:36.300
- He didn't give me up
in the first interview.

33:38.533 --> 33:41.567
They're gonna torture him.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.067
- I tried, Will.

33:44.067 --> 33:47.300
I had him in my hands,
and he ran.

33:48.633 --> 33:51.133
He was so young.

33:54.067 --> 33:57.067
- To be habitable for humans,
a planet must have three things.

33:57.067 --> 33:58.700
What's the first one?
- Water.

33:58.733 --> 34:01.067
- Excellent, goes there.

34:02.867 --> 34:07.800
And what is the second--
the second answer?

34:07.833 --> 34:09.600
- Oxygen.
- Very good.

34:09.633 --> 34:10.833

And the third?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.733
- Sunlight.
- Good job, Gracie.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.633
All right, let's move on
to question number two.

"Astronomers estimate that there
are 8.8 billion

34:23.533 --> 34:26.300
habitable planets..."

34:26.333 --> 34:27.800
- What's wrong, Charlie?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.500

please, Gracie.

- Hey, get--Charlie,

34:33.767 --> 34:35.267
get back here.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.733
Gracie, you are not done
with your lesson.

34:36.767 --> 34:38.567
I'm serious.
[door thuds]

34:38.600 --> 34:39.600
I will not tolerate--

Will.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.200
- Charlie, Gracie.

[indistinct radio chatter]

37:57.467 --> 37:58.733
- What happened?

38:00.600 --> 38:01.667
- Where are they?

38:01.700 --> 38:03.567
- They've been relocated.

[tense music]

38:09.067 --> 38:16.100

38:20.067 --> 38:22.400
- He never listened to you.

38:22.433 --> 38:29.467
*

38:32.467 --> 38:34.733
- Not many people could have
done that.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.300
I owe you.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.767
- I want to learn.

39:23.267 --> 39:25.933

39:25.967 --> 39:27.800
- Just for a little while.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.100
It's not so bad.

39:30.133 --> 39:32.900
- We'll decorate,
and we'll make it a home.

39:51.067 --> 39:52.700
Okay.

40:07.767 --> 40:09.367
- Welcome home.

40:17.033 --> 40:19.467
Don't blame me.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.300
I told you
what was gonna happen,

40:21.333 --> 40:23.300
and then it happened.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.833
- They killed everyone.

40:27.867 --> 40:29.600
- Yeah.

40:29.633 --> 40:31.800
- You work for them.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.733
- So does your father.

40:33.767 --> 40:36.300
So does everyone
who is holding out hope

40:36.333 --> 40:39.133
that someday
things will be different.

40:40.833 --> 40:43.367
You survived.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.667
Don't forget why.

Give my best to your dad.
