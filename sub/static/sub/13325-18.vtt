WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:04.069
I devoted myself to mark
for eight months

00:04.071 --> 00:06.105
And he broke up with me
in a text message.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.440
I think what I did
is a reasonable response.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.409
Well, I agree that writing him
that letter

00:10.411 --> 00:12.344
Expressing your pain
was therapeutic.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.481
What I'm not
so sure about is...

00:15.483 --> 00:18.183
"wanting to light
his hair on fire

00:18.185 --> 00:20.652
And put it out
with a hammer."

00:20.654 --> 00:22.354
It just really hurts.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.723
I've never had to deal
with these emotions before.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.593
This is my first time
being the dumpee and not
the dumper.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.397
I've heard that the first time
always hurts for the dumper.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.267
Okay, ed, that's definitely
another dollar in the jar.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.136
No, it's okay.
I don't care

00:37.138 --> 00:39.304
Because he's gonna
be dead soon.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.807
No, I'm fit as a fiddle.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.810
Doc says my stage four
homophobia

00:44.812 --> 00:47.579
Is keeping me young.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.248
Ed, this is not the time.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.583
The time was, like, 1952.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.354
Oh, and here's his huge reason
for breaking up with me.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.190
He said he wanted to have
a fun summer.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.159
Oh, my god, that's awful.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.327
I'm totally gonna use that.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.830
When I'm alone,
all I think about

01:04.832 --> 01:06.732
Is parking outside
of his house

01:06.734 --> 01:09.535
Or showing up at his job
and screaming at him.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.770
Patrick, fixing in on those
kinds of thoughts is unhealthy.

01:11.772 --> 01:15.074
And I think that it's important
not to spend this really
critical time alone.

01:15.076 --> 01:18.744
When mark left me
he took all of our friends,

01:18.746 --> 01:20.312
That heartless bastard.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.682
- All of them?
- Mark was a very
likeable guy.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.684
You don't have to be alone.
There's people right here

01:25.686 --> 01:27.619
In this room that would spend
time with you, right, guys?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.789
Well, I would, but I want
to have a fun summer, too.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.159
I'd be happy to hang out
with you, patrick.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.495
Well, there you go.
Thank you, lacey.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.364
Yeah, and maybe we could
chill at your house
and watch a movie.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.800
Oh, and you could invite
that jewelry designer you know.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.735
Why would I invite him?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.205
So he could fall in love
with me and give me a necklace.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.374
Lacey, have you ever done
something nice

01:49.376 --> 01:51.743
For someone without expecting
something in return?

01:51.745 --> 01:54.646
Of course I have.
I always do nice things
for other people.

01:54.648 --> 01:58.250
Like one time, I told a blind
woman she needed a nose job.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.487
How else would she know?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.855
I'm not sure
that counts, lacey.

02:02.857 --> 02:04.790
Actually, I'm positive
that doesn't count.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.727
Okay, everybody, time's up.
See you next session.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.201
Hey, lacey,
let's see if you

02:16.203 --> 02:18.570
Can do one truly selfless
thing for someone else.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.906
Okay, charlie.
I'll do that.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.841
Just for you.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.543
- That doesn't count.
- Damn.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.748
- Hey, jen.
- Hey, charlie.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.483
I got a big favor
to ask.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.285
I'm thinking about
starting a new business

02:33.287 --> 02:35.154
And I need $10,000.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.622
$10,000?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.924
Okay, it's just $1,000.
You see what I did there?

02:38.926 --> 02:41.493
That's a sales trick
I learned at a seminar

02:41.495 --> 02:44.263
That you paid $1,000 for.

02:44.265 --> 02:48.167
Just so you know,
that smile stopped working
on me $1,000 ago.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.369
This is a huge opportunity.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.338
Do you remember that plus-size
edible underwear company

02:53.340 --> 02:55.807
I tried to start
a couple years ago?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.743
Yeah, why did you think
that would work?

02:57.745 --> 03:00.746
Because fat people
like to have sex, too,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.848
And they really,
really like candy.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.521
Anyway, I had a bunch
of unsold merchandise
in my garage

03:09.523 --> 03:11.356
And it's been
overrun by ants.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.891
So you need the money
for an exterminator?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.893
Are you kidding?
The company that makes

03:14.895 --> 03:16.929
The ant farms
is looking for ants.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.931
Those ants
are crawling gold.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.801
You know what?
You are a public service
ad for college.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.871
I didn't go to college
'cause I was supporting you.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.906
So I never found out
what I'm good at.

03:27.908 --> 03:31.276
I hear you, jen,
but I'm not so sure
that ants are the answer.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.978
I don't agree.
I think it'd be great.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.947
Okay, well, we can talk
about it-- is that an ant?

03:34.949 --> 03:37.816
Son of a bitch!
I hate 'em! Ugh!

03:40.420 --> 03:42.654
Charlie, you've got to help
me find something.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.392
Patrick? What are you
still doing here?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.462
Oh, I'm just thinking about
what it's gonna be like
to be alone.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.931
Today, tonight,

03:52.933 --> 03:56.235
Tomorrow day,
tomorrow night,

03:56.237 --> 03:59.805
The next day,

03:59.807 --> 04:01.473
And the next night.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.442
Okay, I see where
this is going.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.978
Look, I would love
to let you hang out,

04:05.980 --> 04:09.348
But my dad's coming
for dinner tonight.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.883
I've cancelled on him
12 times in the last two weeks.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.786
If I do it again
he's gonna sense that
something's up.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.657
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

04:18.659 --> 04:19.958
( whimpers )

04:19.960 --> 04:22.828
- Bad breakup?
- The worst.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.763
Well, you know
what helps me?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.699
Knowing that someday
when he's lying in a gutter

04:27.701 --> 04:31.703
Crying and alone,
starving yet somehow fat,

04:31.705 --> 04:35.274
He'll realize you
were the best thing
that ever happened to him.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.643
You know, patrick,
you guys should hang out.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.712
Jen's been through
some terrible breakups.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.715
I remember this one
with with this incredibly
handsome gentleman.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.884
It's true, patrick.
Charlie used to be handsome.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.422
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:57.297 --> 04:59.965
So, hey,
I think I've got a way

04:59.967 --> 05:02.401
To trick your stepmother
into taking me back.

05:02.403 --> 05:06.638
So I guess you weren't
enjoying that awkward silence
as much as I was.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.341
No, no, listen to me.
Here's what I'm thinking, see.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.943
She won't talk to me
so you'll call her

05:11.945 --> 05:14.313
And say how you're
really worried about me.

05:14.315 --> 05:18.417
I haven't stopped crying
since I read about some
orphanage in darfur.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.886
Anyway, you'll plead
with her to come out here
and take care of me

05:20.888 --> 05:22.788
Or take me back
to cincinnati.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.389
No, wait, forget darfur

05:24.391 --> 05:26.358
Because she may have
an opinion about that.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.660
Just say africa, okay?
What do you say?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.829
Uh-uh. No way.
I'm not lying to
corinne for you.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.564
Oh, come on, charlie.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.933
Don't you think
some good should come
out of that tragedy?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.703
<i>( knocking )</i>

05:37.705 --> 05:39.905
- Hey.
- Hey, lace.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.807
Come on in.
Got your phone right here.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.410
By the way,
somebody named satan called
for you, like, 20 times.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.380
My mother
is so codependent.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.950
Lacey, have you ever
tricked somebody

05:51.952 --> 05:53.919
Into getting back together
with you before?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.521
Have I ever not?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
Don't get her involved, dad.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.925
No, I just want
her opinion.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.060
Easiest way to get somebody
to take you back

06:02.062 --> 06:03.862
Is to pretend
you're pregnant.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.764
I would do that,

06:05.766 --> 06:08.633
Except I think I've already
gone through the change.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.802
You know what else works?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.938
Put some pictures of you
and a hot woman

06:12.940 --> 06:15.874
Having a great time
on your facebook page.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.610
I don't have
a facebook page
or a hot woman.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.947
Well, today is you lucky day,
old man charlie.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.484
I'm gonna help you set up
a facebook account

06:25.486 --> 06:28.053
Because I actually like
helping people.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.657
Because despite
what some people think,
middle-aged charlie,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.393
I am totally selfless

06:34.395 --> 06:36.928
And I'm gonna be that hot
woman he gets to pose with.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.830
I'm gonna do this.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.768
And this.
( laughs )

06:45.872 --> 06:47.439
You really think
this'll work?

06:47.441 --> 06:49.941
Oh, yeah.
Women hate me.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.480
I thought
you'd like to know

06:55.482 --> 06:57.649
I'm not wearing
any underwear.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.885
Neither am I.

07:00.953 --> 07:04.756
You know, not as sexy
coming from a guy.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.958
I wasn't trying to be sexy.
My washing machine broke.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.896
- ( laughing )
- oh, hey, guys.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.864
- Hey.
- I have to thank you,
charlie.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.100
Jen is the best.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.936
We spent all afternoon
in her garage killing ants.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.938
It was so therapeutic.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.708
She told me to think of
every little ant as my ex.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.445
It's hard to throttle
an ant's neck, but he did it.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.781
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna skip
to the loo, my darling.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.952
Jen, I really appreciate what
you're doing with patrick.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.187
Just so we're on
the same page,

07:35.189 --> 07:37.789
I'm trying to downplay
his revenge fantasies

07:37.791 --> 07:41.092
So I'm not sure the best
thing right now is a teeny
tiny killing spree.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.062
Well, don't worry.
He's feeling great.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.031
And by the way,
so am I.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.468
I finally found it.
This is what I was
meant to do--

07:49.470 --> 07:51.937
Help people by being
positive and optimistic.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.238
Thanks, charlie.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.975
So you suggested
she help patrick?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.644
No, I just thought
she should keep him company.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.647
Yeah, and guess
what it lead to.
I'm gonna be a life coach.

08:02.649 --> 08:07.152
Except it only requires
six afternoons at the y.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.187
Jen, you do know
that I didn't ask you

08:09.189 --> 08:11.256
To coach or give
patrick any advice.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.925
Oh, I'm just being
positive and optimistic.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.994
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.029
No danger of that.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.635
I won't do this
on a bare mattress, charlie.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.170
I feel like I'm in prison.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.539
I told you the guy
from sears

08:27.541 --> 08:29.274
Is coming
to fix the washing
machine tomorrow.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.510
Come on, it'll be fun.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.612
Like we're in the back
of a van.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.247
Don't you have
another set of sheets?

08:35.249 --> 08:36.948
Yeah, but your stilettos
ripped them to shreds.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.884
It was like I had sex
with wolverine.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.553
Okay, then,
here's another dodge.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.555
Did patrick ever show up
for group today?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.557
No, he didn't make it.
Why, should I be worried?

08:45.559 --> 08:49.160
About jen's influence
on patrick? Probably.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.596
I know. I know.
A life coach.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.198
That's for people
who don't want to undergo

08:53.200 --> 08:56.034
The rigorous training
to become a tarot card reader.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.703
You do realize
she's going to undermine

08:58.705 --> 09:00.705
Everything you're doing
with patrick in group?

09:00.707 --> 09:04.609
And now she finally feels
like she's doing something
with her life.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.178
- I don't know what to do.
- Here's one idea.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.682
Let's get out of this
crack den and do it someplace
sexier like the kitchen

09:10.684 --> 09:12.183
Or the floor of the garage.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.618
Race you.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.890
Just so everyone knows,
I helped charlie's father

09:18.892 --> 09:21.159
Set up his facebook
profile yesterday

09:21.161 --> 09:23.895
And didn't ask
for anything in return.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.299
I even drank
a vodka ensure with him.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.168
That's how selfless I am.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.705
Vodka ensure.
I'll have to try that.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.174
I've had gin
and pedialyte.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.176
I slept
like a drunk baby.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.113
Martin's on facebook?

09:42.115 --> 09:46.651
Looks like somebody here
is about to have friends
in the double digits.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.086
Good for you, lacey.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.354
And nolan.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.892
Hey, charlie, your dad's
page is pretty cool.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.694
He likes frank sinatra,

09:55.696 --> 09:58.029
The early bird special
at red lobster.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.966
Oh, look at this.

10:00.968 --> 10:05.604
He thinks marissa is a flat,
skanky ho with a big fat ass.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.275
He also told lequisha
if he sees her at juicy
couture again

10:10.277 --> 10:14.312
He's going to rip
that low-rent weave
right off her head.

10:15.915 --> 10:19.317
He's so hip.
( laughs )

10:19.319 --> 10:21.152
Lacey, is this why
you helped my father?

10:21.154 --> 10:24.322
So you could
set up an account
and secretly cyberbully

10:24.324 --> 10:27.192
Marissa and lequisha?

10:27.194 --> 10:31.329
No. I just figured
I'd reconnect with a few
of my best friends

10:31.331 --> 10:33.264
Who blocked me.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.102
Lacey, I want you
to go back to my father,

10:37.104 --> 10:40.772
Apologize for using him,
and then take down
his account.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.641
Oh, man.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.109
Now I'm back to nine.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.145
Oh, sorry
I'm a few minutes
late, everybody.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.048
I'm just glad you're here.
I was afraid you were gonna
miss another session.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.916
Sorry, I was having
a romantic lunch

10:51.918 --> 10:54.019
With my new
potential boyfriend.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.687
He's on a 24-hour pass
from rehab

10:55.689 --> 10:57.956
So it was just, like,
on the town.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.891
Wait a minute.
You're dating already?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.793
It's only been a week
since mark broke up with you.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.428
Well, according
to your ex-wife,

11:03.430 --> 11:07.365
The best way
to get over somebody
is to get under somebody.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.801
That is so clever.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.671
Yeah, for a t-shirt.
That's right up there with

11:12.673 --> 11:15.040
"I'm not as think
as you drunk I am."

11:16.442 --> 11:19.344
Look, the end
of a relationship
is a lot like a death.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.279
There's a mourning process.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.114
You haven't even begun
to examine the issues

11:23.116 --> 11:24.949
That contributed to the end
of your last relationship.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.719
( laughing )

11:27.721 --> 11:29.087
What?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.956
That t-shirt thing.
I just got it.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.026
Where do I get
one of them?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.399
Oh, hey, charlie.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.436
I thought you weren't
gonna give him any advice.
Now he's with another guy.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.938
I didn't give him advice.
I just told him

11:46.940 --> 11:49.274
The best way to get over mark
is to find someone new.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.443
That's advice.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.211
Well, it always
worked for me.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.113
Worked for you?
Look at you.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.414
You're a--
is sam here?

11:56.416 --> 11:59.284
- No.
- You're a mess!

11:59.286 --> 12:01.019
I don't want you
spending any more
free time with patrick.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.855
It's not free time.
It's my job.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.490
What job?

12:05.492 --> 12:08.393
Patrick felt he was
monopolizing my time

12:08.395 --> 12:10.261
So he's paying me
to be his life coach.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.097
Oh, here are my new cards.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.499
Could you pass them
out at group?

12:22.775 --> 12:25.143
<i>( knocking )</i>

12:28.848 --> 12:30.782
Lacey. What are you
doing here?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.450
I just wanted to talk
to you for a minute.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.953
Well, come in.
Come on.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.823
Look, I'm gonna leave
the door open, okay?

12:38.825 --> 12:41.526
No offense, but if
my neighbors saw you

12:41.528 --> 12:43.528
Coming in here
dressed like that,
they might think

12:43.530 --> 12:46.798
You're a whore-ably
attractive young lady.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.266
Hey.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.302
Between you, my mom,
and the cops...

12:52.404 --> 12:55.807
Look, I need to talk to you
about your facebook page.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.977
I was using it to hate on
a couple of my old friends.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.212
I'm really sorry.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.914
Well, at least somebody
got some use out of it

13:02.916 --> 13:05.817
'cause this facebook thing
isn't working for me.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.318
Why not?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.554
Look, it was a dumb idea.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.289
When corinne left me

13:11.291 --> 13:14.959
I felt so desperate
and rejected.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.561
Probably like nolan feels

13:16.563 --> 13:19.464
Every time I refuse
his friend request.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.267
Well, you've got
to have standards.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.102
Yeah.
Anyway...

13:24.104 --> 13:26.037
You know, without corinne
in my life,

13:26.039 --> 13:28.339
I just don't know
what's going to happen to me.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.842
I go to bed alone.
I get up alone.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.545
Oh, my god.
I've never done that.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.914
Sometimes I'll go
a whole day

13:35.916 --> 13:38.483
Without talking
to another human being.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.519
No one ever tells you how long
you're gonna be old.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.389
You're freaking me out.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.424
No one's gonna want
me when I'm old.

13:46.426 --> 13:50.128
High maintenance
and saggy boobs
are a bad combo.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.463
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.999
Listen, you came
over here

13:55.001 --> 13:56.534
To help me learn
some new stuff,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.270
And just because it didn't
have a happy ending

13:59.272 --> 14:02.407
Doesn't mean I shouldn't
pay you for your time.

14:02.409 --> 14:06.077
I can't.
Your son wanted me
to do it for free.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.315
I probably gave you
a virus anyway.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.619
What's it matter?
My equipment is so old

14:14.621 --> 14:16.888
I'll probably never use
it again anyway.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.960
What are you all
looking at?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.862
I'm not a whore.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.431
But we did do it.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.366
Right, stud?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.109
Hey, charlie.

14:38.111 --> 14:42.513
Listen, I want to talk
to you about jen being
your life coach.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.516
I'm concerned our advice
may conflict

14:45.518 --> 14:48.620
Because I'm a licensed
therapist and she's
a licensed driver.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.556
Look, I know you're
not happy about it,

14:51.558 --> 14:53.258
But you're gonna
get past it.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.927
And it's just like jen says,
when life gives you lemons,

14:55.929 --> 14:58.897
You make something
with lemons in it.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.366
That's not even the saying.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.501
Hey, everyone.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.671
Hey, jen, I'm sorry
but you can't be here.
I'm about to start a session.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.140
I know, that's why I'm here.
Hey, patrick.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.642
How are we
feeling today?

15:10.644 --> 15:12.911
- We're good.
- Good.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.512
I know how we're feeling.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.548
We're confused.
What the hell is going on?

15:17.550 --> 15:20.118
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have asked
you guys this before.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.388
I've invited
my life coach here.
I hope that's all right.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.423
- Fine by me.
- Bring it.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.992
I suppose it's
all right as long
as she doesn't judge me

15:27.994 --> 15:29.594
If I say something
off-colored.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.396
It's off-color.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.032
Even your mispronunciations
are racist.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.067
Okay, fine.
Jen, you can stay,

15:36.069 --> 15:39.237
But if you say
anything I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.941
Okay.
Sorry, I mean...
( mouths )

15:42.943 --> 15:44.943
So, patrick, I thought
we would begin today

15:44.945 --> 15:47.278
By talking about your recent
breakup with mark.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.614
Have you though about
how it might have triggered

15:49.616 --> 15:52.283
Some abandonment issues?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.352
( whispering )

16:01.460 --> 16:03.394
No, I haven't.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.463
Okay.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.266
Do you think you can
answer my questions without
the advice of counsel?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.435
( whispering )

16:10.437 --> 16:12.370
( laughs )

16:12.372 --> 16:15.340
You're right, he does kind of
look like that, doesn't he?

16:15.342 --> 16:18.977
Okay, that's it.
Jen, you have to leave.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.078
Well, if she goes,
I go.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.612
Then you both have to go.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.749
Good-bye, charlie.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.250
Jen.

16:28.420 --> 16:32.223
I never would have guessed
he'd have left us for a woman.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.461
Okay, anybody want to
talk about what they're
feeling right now?

16:36.463 --> 16:39.097
I feel a little confused.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.433
Why won't your dad
be my friend on facebook?

16:45.704 --> 16:47.472
For you.

16:48.541 --> 16:53.378
Just a little something
to take your mind off this
whole patrick mess.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.546
I know your washing
machine is fixed,

16:55.548 --> 16:57.248
But in case
it ever happens again

16:57.250 --> 16:59.517
I just wanted to get you
a pair of backup underwear.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.420
This one is called

17:02.422 --> 17:05.156
Hold the mustard.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.193
You went out
and bought that?

17:09.195 --> 17:12.330
No, they were
my great-grandfather's.

17:13.466 --> 17:17.435
Because what my
great-grandfather gave me
won't fit in that bun.

17:19.605 --> 17:23.307
Charlie,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I really need you.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.210
What could you
possibly need me for?
You know everything.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.312
Well, I thought patrick
was over the breakup,

17:28.314 --> 17:31.215
But when mark called him
and said he was gonna pick up
the rest of his stuff,

17:31.217 --> 17:32.650
Patrick lost it.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.318
Well, that's because
he's been in denial.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.520
Getting that phone call
made him realize

17:35.522 --> 17:37.188
The relationship
is officially over.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.057
Oh, man, I should have
told him that.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.593
To have a glass of wine
and burn a picture of mark

17:42.595 --> 17:44.662
As a cleansing ritual.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.564
I guess a glass
turned into a bottle

17:46.566 --> 17:48.499
And a picture turned into
all of mark's stuff.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.401
Got to get over there
as soon as I can.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.703
We've got to get there
before he burns all
of mark's stuff.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.205
We have a couple of minutes.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.774
It's gonna take him a while
to drag out the piano.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.445
Patrick, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.747
- Don't do this.
- Nope, jennifer's right.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.083
I will never feel better
until I get even.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.218
That's not what she said.
That's not what
you said, right?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.653
Sort of what I said.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.289
See?
It's only sort of
what she said.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.392
But this is making
me feel better.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.328
Hey, what are you doing?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.696
Nothing.
Nothing to see here.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.232
Just burning some of
my ex-boyfriend's stuff.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.267
Oh, relationships
are tough.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.437
When you open
your heart to joy,
you risk pain.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.174
But you've got to keep loving,
you've got to keep hurting.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.477
That's really wise.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.178
Who are you?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.580
You don't recognize me?

18:35.582 --> 18:39.317
I'm lester from upstairs.
See you, guys.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.124
Patrick, go ahead
and light it.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.726
And sure, there'll be
a big blaze and you'll
get a ton of attention

18:48.728 --> 18:50.228
And everybody will know
how bad you're hurting.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.231
- Yay!
- But...

18:53.233 --> 18:57.335
When the smoke clears,
all you'll have is a pile
of ashes and a lawsuit.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.337
And you'll still
be stuck with you.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.140
Same problem, same pain.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.376
And the only way
that'll change is if you keep
working to make it better.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.512
And I'm here
to help you through that.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.614
What do you think
I should do, jen?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.649
I think you should
listen to charlie.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.885
- He knows what he's doing.
- Say it louder.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.787
- No, I heard her.
- Not for you, for me.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.391
I get it.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.628
You know, charlie,
there is one little thing
you could do for me.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.663
That's why I'm here.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.465
Could you grab one end
of this piano?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.535
I've got to get
it back upstairs.
Yeah, you, too, coach.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.436
( claps )

19:33.672 --> 19:36.207
Hey, dad, did you know
grandpa's on facebook?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.842
Yeah, I heard.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.211
Did you know
he's dating lacey?

19:40.213 --> 19:43.247
Well, you can't believe
everything you see
on the internet.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.815
Should I accept
nolan's friend request?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.350
God, no.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.352
<i>( knocking )</i>

19:48.354 --> 19:49.754
Hey, charlie.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.556
I'll go get
my stuff, mom.

19:54.226 --> 19:55.660
How you doing?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.595
I'm good.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.398
Still a little embarrassed
about the patrick thing.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.799
I'm really sorry, charlie.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.401
I just thought
I'd found my calling.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.237
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll find it one day.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.806
It's so funny.
Right from the beginning

20:08.808 --> 20:11.309
I just knew it wasn't
going to work out.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.944
Yeah, I had
the same feeling.

20:12.946 --> 20:16.681
Yeah, because you
have a masters degree
in psychology.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.316
I just had a gut feeling.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.685
And that's not the first time.
You know what that means.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.688
No, but it makes me
uncomfortable.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.557
I'm a psychic.
That's what I'm good at.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.959
Jennifer.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.861
People make good money
being psychics.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.564
I could work for the police.
And if I hone my gift

20:33.566 --> 20:36.234
And talk to the dead,
I could be on talk shows.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.603
So this is going
to be your career?

20:39.771 --> 20:43.474
It's gonna be difficult
at first, but yes.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.611
Jen, you really think
you have psychic abilities?

20:48.313 --> 20:51.015
Yes, I do because...

20:51.017 --> 20:52.950
I knew you'd fall for this.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.318
( laughs )

20:54.320 --> 20:55.953
Oh, come on.
You were just pretending?

20:55.955 --> 20:58.422
- You were making
all this stuff up?
- Yeah.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.391
Well, you had me.
You ever thought about acting?

21:00.393 --> 21:02.360
- I bet you could
do commercials.
- Really?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.395
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, if you wanted to go,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.530
Acting school is something
I would definitely pay for.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.466
Oh, you're just screwing
with me, aren't you?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.835
Wow, you are psychic.
