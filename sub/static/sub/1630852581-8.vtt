WEBVTT

00:22.640 --> 00:24.760
POLICE SIRENS RING

00:43.160 --> 00:45.240
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.960
Sorry, did I take
the space you wanted?

00:46.960 --> 00:49.000
No, Miss Windermere.
What you took was a bend,

00:49.000 --> 00:50.440
at 100mph.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.120
Oh, I'd hardly call it
100mph.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.520
I'll hear no argument.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.800
You could've caused
a serious accident.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.560
So I'm sorry, but you've left
me no choice.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.120
SHE SIGHS UNHAPPILY

01:22.920 --> 01:24.440
Do I really have to do this?

01:25.400 --> 01:30.280
When you use your family connections
to get you out of hot water,

01:30.280 --> 01:33.120
a voluntary penance seems fair.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.760
I don't mind doing my bit,

01:36.840 --> 01:39.240
but what if they positively
hate me?

01:39.240 --> 01:41.000
Just be yourself.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.920
And if that doesn't work,
we'll be finished by lunchtime.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.440
Father Brown, so good to see
you again.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.560
Welcome to Langley Hall.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.200
Thank you, Miss Watson.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.000
Delighted to be able
to see Langley Hall at first hand.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.720
Well, I hope it won't disappoint.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.360
And this must be Miss Windermere.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.520
Hello.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.200
This is my deputy, Miss Harris.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.640
Emily, please.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.520
Oh, well, good, call me Bunty.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.760
Informality is permitted of course,

02:17.760 --> 02:20.680
but not in front of
the girls, if you don't mind.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.680
Shall we go in?

02:23.680 --> 02:25.240
The girls are ever so excited.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.600
They almost never get any visitors.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.400
Oh, well, then, I'm not sure
a lecture on etiquette

02:30.400 --> 02:32.960
and social comportment will quite
meet their expectations.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.000
Trust me,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.560
they'll just be glad to get out of
workshop for an hour.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.480
As you can see, the girls are taught
practical skills.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.040
Mothercraft, laundering,
dressmaking,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.560
and cooking, of course.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.840
Miss Harris' baking classes are
always popular.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.520
It's all very useful, I'm sure.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.000
But may I ask about academic
subjects?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.920
A good question, Father.
One I've asked many times myself.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.960
This is Miss Delaney,

03:01.960 --> 03:04.120
one of our longest serving officers.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.640
The girls receive regular schooling.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.360
And religious instruction.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.520
We have a small chapel
on the grounds for Sunday worship.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.360
Ah.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.040
I have to say, I did expect
the girls to be...

03:17.040 --> 03:19.360
..well, girls.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.000
The youngest we have are 16,
the oldest, 23.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.520
Come, we'll show you the kitchens
and the laundry workshop.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.160
Have we got time though,
Miss Harris?

03:28.160 --> 03:30.640
Certainly. The talk's at midday.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.760
Miss Watson, perhaps we could allow
Brenda out to join us.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.880
I'm sure she's learned her lesson
by now.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.960
Brenda has been confined,
for fighting and telling fibs.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.920
Her and Kate had a falling out,

03:45.920 --> 03:48.000
but usually they're the best
of friends.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.480
I'm sure there'll be no more
trouble, will there, Kate?

03:52.920 --> 03:54.200
Oh, no, Miss.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.920
Very well.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.200
Promise me you'll be on your
best behaviour?

04:07.200 --> 04:10.000
Cross my heart and hope to die...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.040
..Miss.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.520
Did you miss me, girls?

04:15.520 --> 04:18.080
What am I saying? Course you did.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.880
This place ain't
the same without me.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.520
Kate.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.880
Don't be cross.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.800
I'm sorry we had a bust up.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.080
I'm sorry, too.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.200
Is that your breakfast,
you mucky cow?

04:39.280 --> 04:43.800
I do not appreciate being undermined
in front of our guests.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.160
As for your conduct this morning,
we will discuss it later.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.840
Hiya, I'm Brenda.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.000
Bet you've never been in
a place like this before.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
No, not exactly.
But I did go to boarding school.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.240
Dreadful food and draconian rules.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.280
Ooh, well, I never.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.040
Bet that cost a fortune too.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.880
At least we're here for free.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
It's time, Miss Windermere.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.240
Yes.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.320
Girls. Take your seats, please.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.400
Miss Windermere,

05:21.400 --> 05:22.920
I would keep an eye on your things.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.720
Oh. Thank you, Miss Watson.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.800
Good afternoon, girls.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.200
It's such a pleasure to be here
with you today.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.760
My name is Penelope Windermere,

05:39.760 --> 05:42.160
and I'd like to share
a few tips on how best

05:42.160 --> 05:44.480
to present yourself in society.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.160
Social comportment is
a necessary currency

05:47.160 --> 05:49.960
for any modern woman,
from all walks of life.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.080
All right, I know it helps if you're
rather la-de-da like me.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.200
But I have been far from lady-like
in the past, believe me.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.440
A penchant for married men

06:01.440 --> 06:03.640
hasn't exactly won me
plaudits from the press.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.760
THEY GIGGLE

06:04.760 --> 06:07.600
Not to mention the alcohol,
parties, fast cars.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.640
LAUGHTER

06:08.640 --> 06:11.120
I could tell you a few stories,
that is for sure.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.880
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

06:12.880 --> 06:14.040
But I won't.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.600
What I mean to say is,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
anyone can learn
a few social graces,

06:18.600 --> 06:20.240
and they may well give you the edge

06:20.240 --> 06:22.040
over other girls when seeking
employment.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.400
You told me to be myself.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.560
You certainly were.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.160
Slovenliness is
unacceptable, Brenda.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.680
After lunch, you're
to scrub that stain out.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.960
Yes, Miss.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.000
What a feast.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.120
I love your bracelet.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.080
Oh, thank you.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.720
Your jewellery's very
lovely as well.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.440
They're not real, I'm afraid.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.800
I never would have guessed.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.120
Have you lost something?

07:00.120 --> 07:03.480
My compact mirror.
I must have left it somewhere.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.760
Miss Watson,

07:04.760 --> 07:07.320
Miss Windermere is missing
a compact mirror.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.720
It was in her handbag.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.880
Oh.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.200
I was afraid this might happen.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.040
Girls, remain standing.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.960
An item has been stolen from
Miss Windermere.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.160
Hands.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.080
Please, this isn't necessary,

07:27.080 --> 07:28.760
I really don't care about
the mirror.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.840
Forgive me, Miss Windermere,
but we cannot tolerate theft.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.160
Perhaps if you appealed to them,

07:37.160 --> 07:40.160
the guilty party might...

07:40.160 --> 07:44.840
One can hardly expect moral
rectitude from a thief, Father.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.520
Officers, search their pockets.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.960
Brenda?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.720
It's here, Miss Watson.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.360
I never put that there.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.440
I never!

08:13.440 --> 08:15.000
Brenda Palmer.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.800
I should have guessed.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.480
But I never took it, Miss Watson,
I swear.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.200
Someone must've put it in
my pocket.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.120
A likely story.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.520
Girls, you may take your seats
and commence with lunch.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.880
Come with me.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.800
I said, I didn't do it,
Miss Watson.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.520
I hate you. I wish you were dead.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.960
Get out.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.080
Father, perhaps you'll say grace
for us before we begin?

08:58.960 --> 09:02.960
And to think I almost believed some
of the lies you told.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.200
Well, I will not be made
a fool of again.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.440
Make no mistake, Brenda,

09:08.440 --> 09:12.040
this time there will be
severe consequences.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.480
It's not fair.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.920
The awful thing is,
I would've gladly given it to her.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.160
It's not your fault.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.920
Brenda's her own worst
enemy sometimes.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.520
The girls really did enjoy your
talk. Oh, good.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.760
You're welcome to visit any time.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.480
Perhaps I should join your
baking class?

09:44.480 --> 09:46.960
Oh, do, that would be such fun.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.920
We had hoped to thank Miss Watson,
but she didn't rejoin us.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.920
Oh. I don't think she's in her
office.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.040
I could look for her?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.760
No need. Please pass on our
gratitude.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.440
Of course.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.560
Goodbye.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.120
Brenda?
We thought you might be hungry.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.080
Miss Watson?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.480
Miss Watson?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.440
She's dead.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.640
I'll, I'll call the police.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.400
Where's Brenda?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.080
Surely she didn't...?

10:32.680 --> 10:35.920
Well, I survived that, despite
the slop they tried to serve us.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.800
Bunty, we should be grateful
for their hospitality.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.560
As I shall be grateful for
a nice cup of tea,

10:41.560 --> 10:43.720
to take away the aftertaste.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.640
Oh, that does sound good actually.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.040
I'll be right in.

10:50.800 --> 10:56.200
Brenda. Sorry, don't mind me.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.760
Thanks for the lift, then.
I'll just be on my way.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.160
Oh, no. No, no, no,
please, wait. So we can talk.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.240
What for? No-one ever believes
a word I say.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.960
I'll believe you, I promise you.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.880
I never pinched that mirror.
I didn't.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.040
And now I'm going to be locked up
for longer,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.080
and it ain't fair, cos I was
already let out.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.480
What do you mean?
My sentence was up last month.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.680
I was sent to work in an house for
this mean old bag

11:20.680 --> 11:22.520
and her husband.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.760
They made me work for no pay,

11:24.760 --> 11:27.360
and when I complained about it,

11:27.360 --> 11:29.280
they walloped me.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.720
So I ran away...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.960
..and then got in trouble again,

11:33.960 --> 11:36.040
and I wound up back in Borstal.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.520
Told you you'd think I were lying.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.680
No. No, I'm - I'm just thinking...

11:43.800 --> 11:45.640
Brenda? How on earth?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.920
I ain't going back
to that Borstal. Not ever.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.080
Brenda!

11:51.680 --> 11:53.360
This is most troubling.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.480
Oh, I know it's bad that
she escaped,

11:55.480 --> 11:57.160
but it's not like she's dangerous.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.400
I'm not so sure.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.000
I just received a telephone call
from Langley Hall.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
It's Miss Watson.
She's been murdered.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.880
She was hiding in the car.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.120
We didn't find her until we got back
to the presbytery.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.440
And she just ran off?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.200
We couldn't stop her.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.640
Thanks for informing me. A murder.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.920
Of all the days for Inspector
Mallory to take annual leave.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.400
I'm sure you'll rise to
the occasion, Sergeant.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.000
Excuse me, who's in charge
here, please?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.360
I am.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.840
Then I think you need to hear this.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.160
Brenda threw something away.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.320
I don't know what, but I saw her...

12:37.480 --> 12:39.000
..from the window.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.080
Sarge.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.080
A set of keys.
Are they the victim's?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.520
They must be.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.800
Miss Delaney and I noticed them
missing from her belt.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.160
We need to find Brenda Palmer, now.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.480
Come on, inside.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.760
I can't believe Brenda would
kill anyone.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.560
For now, I'm keeping an open mind.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.120
I know what it's like
to be falsely accused, Father.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.400
Yes.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.840
I intend to stay
and find out the truth, Bunty.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.080
Though one thing's for certain,

13:22.080 --> 13:25.040
there's more going on here than
meets the eye.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.480
I'm sorry, but the girls have had a
nasty shock,

13:31.480 --> 13:33.080
all outsiders must leave.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.600
But might I not be helpful in
offering the girls some solace?

13:35.600 --> 13:37.000
That's not necessary.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.120
Miss Delaney,

13:38.120 --> 13:40.400
surely if a man of the cloth wishes
to offer support to

13:40.400 --> 13:42.160
the girls, we should allow it.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.640
I suppose it's your decision,
as interim Governor.Excuse me.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.480
A spot of professional jealousy?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.840
I'm not sure any of my officers
relish my new authority.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.480
Just most of them manage
to hide it better.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.080
But presumably Miss Watson would
have approved of your new position?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.600
Of course, she appointed me.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.320
I only ask, because I saw her
admonish you this morning.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.000
Over Brenda? Yes.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.400
She felt I'd overstepped the mark by
asking for her to be let out.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.320
She was afraid she'd cause trouble.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.640
Is that all?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.280
Well, it's hardly a trifle.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.000
You could say she was proven right.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.760
Then you think Brenda could have
killed her?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.960
Honestly, I don't know.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.040
She had a troubled childhood,
like many of the girls here.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.760
But to be capable of such violence.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.520
So, Miss Watson's head struck
the corner of the bench,

14:44.520 --> 14:46.680
with lethal force,

14:46.680 --> 14:49.000
perhaps more than once.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.320
How awful.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.520
I fail to see how these grisly
details are any business of yours.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.240
Well, my business is
the safety of the girls.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.040
And I think determining the killer
is the best way to ensure that.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.280
Well, the police have already made
their enquiries,

15:03.280 --> 15:04.480
so if you wouldn't mind.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.720
Just one more thing.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.680
When you and Miss Harris discovered
the body,

15:10.680 --> 15:13.160
was the door locked or unlocked?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.920
It was locked.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.200
Presumably to buy time before
the body was discovered.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.080
And then the keys were
disposed of in the garden.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.200
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

15:34.080 --> 15:37.280
I see no reason for you
to upset Kate any further.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.960
Kate,

15:40.960 --> 15:44.160
may I ask you a few more questions?

15:44.160 --> 15:46.680
I already told the police
everything.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.840
Please, I don't want to go through
it all again.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.400
Understandably so.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.960
Today has been very distressing.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.040
And speaking out against your
friend can't have been easy.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.760
I had to say what I saw.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.000
Of course.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.680
I need to ask you,

16:00.680 --> 16:03.720
which window you saw
Brenda throw the keys from?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.440
I was upstairs.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.000
Upstairs where exactly?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.360
You see, I've checked.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.560
And the point where the keys were
found isn't visible from any window,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.720
on any floor except the attic.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.840
Is that where you were?

16:23.840 --> 16:27.400
Yes. That's right, the attic.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.480
May I ask why?

16:31.440 --> 16:33.440
I go there sometimes,

16:33.440 --> 16:34.560
to be alone.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.960
There's a man outside!

16:38.960 --> 16:41.520
All right, girls, settle down.
You're perfectly safe in here.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.400
Kate. Get down from the window.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.120
Do you recognise him?

16:55.480 --> 16:58.800
Well, Kate's clearly lying through
her teeth about being in the attic.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.000
Agreed.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.400
And the inscrutable Miss Delaney has
barely let us out of her sight.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.280
Well, at least Miss Harris
seems trustworthy.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.760
Do you think?

17:08.760 --> 17:11.320
I suspect her that conflict
with Miss Watson

17:11.320 --> 17:13.080
is about more than she's letting on.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.600
Ah!

17:14.600 --> 17:15.720
Oh!

17:15.720 --> 17:18.080
With no walls to keep the girls in,

17:18.080 --> 17:20.480
there's nothing to keep danger out.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.000
Father Brown. They've found Brenda.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.800
It wasn't me, I swear.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.280
Miss Palmer, you fled the
crime scene.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.480
I didn't.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.520
I did.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.600
I didn't know someone had
killed her.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.640
So why did you run when my officers
approached you?

17:41.640 --> 17:43.520
I was scared.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.680
That's all. OK.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.880
So, here's what I know.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.760
A dozen witnesses heard you shouting
that you wanted

17:51.760 --> 17:53.320
Miss Watson dead.

17:53.320 --> 17:57.360
And one of the Borstal girls saw
you throw the keys into the gardens.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.360
Who said that? Kate Goddall.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.400
She's lying.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.560
You see, I think you took the keys
from Miss Watson,

18:05.560 --> 18:06.720
because you killed her.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.960
No. Miss Watson locked me up,

18:08.960 --> 18:10.680
and that is the last time that
I saw her.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.800
How did you escape?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.360
Someone let me out.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.920
I don't know who it was,
but they just unlocked the door.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.120
Maybe someone wanted me to run away
so then I'd look guilty.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.800
Miss Palmer,

18:25.800 --> 18:29.680
you were angry at Miss Watson
and you lashed out.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.120
You could make this all a lot easier
if you simply told the truth.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.560
They keep telling me not to lie,

18:39.560 --> 18:42.600
but then they want me to confess
to something I didn't even do.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.200
That's a terrible dilemma for
an innocent girl.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.360
Which you are, aren't you?

18:50.600 --> 18:51.960
You believe me, Father?

18:54.240 --> 18:58.680
Yes, I do, but there is much left to
unravel.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.720
I'm told you claim that someone
helped you escape.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.800
So who do you think unlocked
the door?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.120
It could've been Kate.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.120
Maybe that's how she knew where
the keys were.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.120
But do you think Kate is capable
of murder?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.800
Maybe.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.920
You two used to be friends until
recently.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.440
What happened?

19:23.440 --> 19:26.600
She was jealous cos I got let out.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.280
And then when they brought me back,

19:28.280 --> 19:31.360
she said it served me right
for making up stories.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.240
So I whacked her,
in her stupid face.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.080
Ah.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.920
And then we had a big scrap in the
middle of the veggie patch.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.400
We was covered in
squashed tomatoes.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.200
Miss Watson was livid.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.640
Miss Watson's death was violent,

19:57.640 --> 20:01.120
but Brenda didn't have
a spot of blood on her clothes.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.800
According to the officers,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.720
all the girls have two
identical sets,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.320
so, I mean, she could have changed.

20:06.320 --> 20:10.000
No. She had a food stain on her
apron before the murder.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.520
And she still has it now.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.360
What about the witness who saw her
throwing the Governor's keys?

20:14.360 --> 20:17.320
May I ask if you found
Brenda's fingerprints on them?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.920
No. They were wiped clean.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.080
Then it's the word
of one girl against another.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.640
Yeah, well, someone killed the
Governor, Father.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.120
If not, who else could it be?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.600
There was a young man seen watching
the Borstal.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.440
We didn't get a good look at him,
but he had dark hair.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.440
He left a distinctive footprint.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.000
And I've noticed tension
amongst the staff,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.800
who all wear uniforms,

20:37.800 --> 20:40.280
and no doubt have identical sets.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.360
I have to admit, Brenda has no
history of violence.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.240
I mean, I can look into any of
the girls that do,

20:45.240 --> 20:48.720
maybe run some background checks on
the staff.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.600
And what about Brenda?

20:50.600 --> 20:53.880
She's suffered a lot of confinement
for one day.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.880
Well, I'll return her to
the borstal, for now.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.400
But, Father, if I find anything that
proves she's lied to us,

21:00.400 --> 21:01.880
I'll have to charge her.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.680
I wouldn't expect anything else.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.760
Oh, and, Sergeant...

21:05.760 --> 21:07.960
..I knew you'd be good at this.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.200
We're going to be late.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.200
Patience is a virtue, Penelope.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.520
So is initiative.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.560
ENGINE ROARS

21:45.240 --> 21:49.040
I now see why the Constabulary is
so concerned with your driving.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.440
I got us here on time, didn't I?

21:51.440 --> 21:55.360
Miss Delaney, Miss Harris said I
could join her baking class.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
Of course. Go on up.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.800
I sense we got off on the wrong foot
yesterday.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.440
May I tag along?

22:07.360 --> 22:11.440
So, we're going to make
the icing for our buns.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.040
First we need to sieve
the icing sugar.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.320
What?!

22:25.320 --> 22:27.360
Nothing.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.800
Good. Now gradually add warm water,

22:31.800 --> 22:34.520
and stir the icing sugar until it
starts to thicken.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.800
Um...

22:44.800 --> 22:47.040
Miss Harris,
mine's gone funny.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.680
Yeah, that's cause you used baking
soda, dummy.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.680
Well, at least I'm not a stupid,
lying cow like you!

22:52.680 --> 22:54.080
Oh, all right.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.800
Let's not do that.
Brenda. Go and sit in the corridor.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.560
When class is over, you'll clean
this mess up.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.600
Go.
Ugh!

23:04.960 --> 23:07.600
Permission to go and change, Miss?

23:07.600 --> 23:08.960
Of course.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.400
The baking soda.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.200
You couldn't read what was on
the packet, could you?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.920
I suppose you think I'm stupid.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.240
Far from it.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.200
Teacher at my old school did.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.600
Called me a dunce.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.440
Made me stand in the corner.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.800
So I hid a dead mouse in her desk.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.640
Good.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.080
I would have done the same.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.960
Brenda, can I...?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.520
I pinched a dress off
a clothing line.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.400
Yeah, I shouldn't have done it,
but...

23:50.400 --> 23:52.720
..I just wanted to look nice
for once.

23:57.360 --> 24:01.600
When I was 16 I tried to steal
a lipstick

24:01.600 --> 24:05.040
from this posh boutique.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.720
I still don't know what possessed
me.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.160
Daring, I suppose.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.400
Did you get in trouble?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.160
They just asked me to leave.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.360
Even now, I'm getting away
with things I shouldn't.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.520
That's sort of the reason why
I'm here.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.960
I'm sorry it's so unfair.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.160
At least we got to be friends.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.680
Yes. We did.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.680
Miss Watson implied
the girls' schooling was sufficient,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.160
but it's only six hours a week.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.880
I suggested we hire
a full-time teacher,

24:43.880 --> 24:46.120
but she wouldn't...

24:43.880 --> 24:46.120
LAUGHTER

24:46.120 --> 24:47.600
Who's there?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.760
Kate?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.960
We saw that young man yesterday.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.800
Who is he?

24:58.800 --> 25:01.240
Answer me, Kate.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.960
She was caught with a boy before
but she wouldn't give his name.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.280
Why would you jeopardise your
release like that?

25:07.280 --> 25:08.600
Your release?

25:08.600 --> 25:10.240
Miss Harris just granted it.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.360
But perhaps she'll change her mind
when she hears about this.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.640
Empty your pockets.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.920
The horse's headdress.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.800
We passed a carriage earlier.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.200
Now, what was written on the side?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.600
Size ten.

25:39.600 --> 25:43.480
A perfect match for the footprint we
found on private property.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.080
Very private. A Borstal For Girls.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.680
I'm sure the police would be very
interested to hear about it.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.960
Please don't.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.920
I recognise you.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.800
From Mass.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.600
Jim?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.480
Joe...

25:59.480 --> 26:01.760
Joe Randall.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.000
I'm sorry, I know I was trespassing,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.160
but I've been keeping out of trouble
for ages now.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.320
I swear, Father.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.120
What kind of trouble, Joe?

26:12.120 --> 26:14.160
A few burglaries.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.720
But not since Kate got sent away,
no, no.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.320
We want to do things right.
We're...

26:21.320 --> 26:23.920
We're gonna get married.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.000
Now that old witch Watson's
finally gone.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.920
That old witch, as you call her,
has been murdered.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.680
Which would seem to be
a happy result for you and Kate.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.400
That doesn't mean we did anything.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.680
Kate implicated someone else.
Maybe to protect you.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.560
I don't know anything about that.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.600
But you know how to get in to
a building unseen.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.320
Miss Watson might have been alone.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.920
Hey, hey, hey, I never touched her.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.240
But I'm not sorry she's dead.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.880
When she caught Kate with me last
year she extended her sentence,

26:52.880 --> 26:56.400
two months at a time,
over and over.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.520
She can't do that, surely?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.400
Who was gonna stop her?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.560
She did as she pleased.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.640
And if it wasn't for Miss Harris, it
would've broken Kate.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.960
Miss Harris?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.600
She let me see Kate, in secret.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.560
Yes, I allowed them to meet.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.640
Did anyone else know
of your decision?

27:22.920 --> 27:25.480
Miss Watson.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.000
When I said she'd admonished me
about Brenda,

27:28.000 --> 27:32.560
the truth is she'd just found out
about Joe and Kate.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.600
She was furious with me
for my "leniency", as she put it.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.280
To allow a relationship between
a young man

27:39.280 --> 27:43.040
and a borstal girl may seem
to some too lenient.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.880
Kate's 21 and they love each other.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.400
And she's more than served her time.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.160
So, I'm releasing her, today.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.200
Miss Delaney found her a job.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.080
A Manor House in Cheltenham have
a position for a maid, apparently.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.920
Brenda said something about
being discharged and sent to work.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.400
But she said they mistreated her.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.480
Brenda. Yes, she was found a job.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.680
Unfortunately she never turned up.

28:08.680 --> 28:12.080
Just kept the train fare, I expect.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.000
Her prerogative, of course,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.520
but she was arrested again
for stealing.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.880
Oh.

28:17.880 --> 28:22.480
We still have hope for Brenda,
but she's a complicated girl.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.960
There's a travel warrant in there

28:26.960 --> 28:29.120
and enough for your train fare,
plus a map,

28:29.120 --> 28:32.120
and details of where you
need to go. Good luck.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.920
Thank you, Miss Harris.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.640
I'll miss you all, very much.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.080
Bye!

29:02.960 --> 29:05.760
It'll be your turn before
you know it.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.520
And next time,
you can do things differently.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.760
You can take the job they
offer you.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.160
But I did.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.320
It was a house in Gloucester.
This mean couple.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.800
Brenda,
you don't need to pretend with me.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.600
You wanted a taste of freedom,
I understand.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.120
You don't believe me.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.160
Go on, be honest,

29:26.160 --> 29:28.680
do you think I stole your mirror?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.800
It doesn't matter if you did.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.360
I tried to pinch that
lipstick once.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.200
I thought you were different.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.960
Miss Helen Delaney?
I'd like to ask you some questions

29:48.960 --> 29:51.120
about the murder
of Miss Cecilia Watson.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.440
Questions?

29:52.440 --> 29:55.640
You were arrested in 1934
for attacking your employer.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.720
He required stitches for
a head wound.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.920
It was self-defence.
And the charges were dropped.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.240
You care to elaborate?

30:01.240 --> 30:03.320
I was 16, and he was 60.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.080
Use your imagination.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.200
Where were you in the hour after
lunch when Miss Watson died?

30:08.200 --> 30:11.080
I was doing administrative work,
in one of the empty classrooms.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.080
Alone?
Yes, alone.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.040
Do you have any actual evidence
against me?

30:15.040 --> 30:16.880
We'd like to search your
living quarters.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.240
I believe borstal staff reside
on the premises?

30:19.240 --> 30:21.000
Let's not pretend you need
my permission.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.120
Now if we're quite finished,
I'm going.

30:27.920 --> 30:32.840
If you discover anything, Sergeant,
I'd be very interested to know.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.880
Likewise, Father.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.720
I feel wretched for saying it,
but it's impossible

30:42.720 --> 30:44.600
to tell when Brenda's telling
the truth.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.480
I feel the same about Miss Delaney.

30:46.480 --> 30:49.040
What did Goodfellow say
about the search yesterday?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.080
They didn't find anything.

30:51.080 --> 30:55.160
But she's had plenty of time to
remove anything incriminating.

30:55.160 --> 30:59.280
So, we are no closer
to solving this puzzle.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.200
What if it isn't a puzzle,
Father?

31:02.200 --> 31:04.920
What if it was Brenda all along?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.640
Father Brown?

31:06.640 --> 31:09.000
I'm sorry,
I didn't know where else to go.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.120
It's Kate, I think she's missing.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.920
She was supposed to call me last
night, but I've not heard from her.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.560
She could still be settling in.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.920
No. I spoke to Miss Harris,
she said she never arrived.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.720
She said she must've run away but
Kate would never do that,
not without me.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.880
That's exactly what Emily said
about Brenda.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.120
That she ran off when she
was released.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.400
But Brenda swore she took the job.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.240
It just doesn't add up, Father.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.960
No, it doesn't.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.920
And I fear Kate is in trouble.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.200
Do you organise employment
for all the girls on their release?

31:39.200 --> 31:41.000
It's one of my duties, yes.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.880
And do you keep records?
Of course I do,

31:42.880 --> 31:46.080
I have to inform the Langley Hall
Association of any placements.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.960
Copies are filed in the Governor's
office. Is this about Kate?

31:49.960 --> 31:51.360
You've heard she's missing.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.800
I had an angry housekeeper on
the telephone this morning,

31:53.800 --> 31:56.600
saying she'd think twice about
offering another ex-borstal girl

31:56.600 --> 31:58.920
a job. It reflects badly on all
of us.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.000
Do you believe Kate would just
run off?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.920
It happens more and more these days.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.000
We try to give the girls
the best start we can,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.960
but not all of them choose
to take it.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.120
Now, I'm sorry,
but I really must go.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.760
It happens more
and more these days.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.840
B Palmer.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.240
Ooh. I saw that in Harrods.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.280
Bunty.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.560
Sorry.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.600
Brenda Palmer.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.800
On initial release she was offered
employment in Stroud,

32:37.800 --> 32:39.880
she failed to arrive.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.400
Stroud?

32:41.400 --> 32:42.800
She told me it was Gloucester.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.960
Harrods.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.160
Bunty,
I think I've got it.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.080
What are you doing in here?

32:52.080 --> 32:55.040
Finding answers, Miss Harris.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.280
The girls reported missing hadn't
run away, had they?

32:58.280 --> 33:01.520
They'd simply been sent elsewhere.
By you.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.720
What are you talking about?

33:02.720 --> 33:06.040
You send them to employers looking
for cheap labour,

33:06.040 --> 33:09.520
and then their wages were sent
directly to you.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.880
Hence a costly handbag.

33:12.880 --> 33:16.760
And you told me that your gold
necklace and watch are fake.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.080
Are they?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.760
Yes. And the bag was a gift.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.560
As for the girl's placements,
Helen arranges them.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.280
But you handed them their
directions

33:25.280 --> 33:26.840
in a sealed envelope.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.200
It would have been simple enough
to alter them.

33:30.240 --> 33:35.800
With Miss Watson out of the way, you
could run this place as you pleased.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.640
You could release girls at will when
you had a vacancy.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.520
And who would listen to a girl with
a criminal past

33:42.520 --> 33:45.120
when she complained
of exploitation?

33:45.120 --> 33:48.120
I swear to you,
I don't know anything about this.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.760
I get the sealed envelopes
from Helen.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.000
I may be the Governor,
but Helen runs this place.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.600
Nothing ever happens here without
her knowledge.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.960
The day before Kate left,

34:01.960 --> 34:04.400
I saw Helen at my desk.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.240
She ended a phone call
and closed a notebook

34:07.240 --> 34:08.840
so that I wouldn't see.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.200
But I caught a glimpse.

34:10.200 --> 34:13.000
It said "Mr & Mrs Webb,
Gloucester".

34:14.600 --> 34:16.320
Thought you didn't believe me.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.560
I know,
we should've listened to you.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.520
We were wrong. I was wrong.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.720
I never should have doubted you,
Brenda.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.640
Just tell us where we can find her.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.680
And why should I help Kate?

34:26.680 --> 34:29.480
Because she's being mistreated,
like you were.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.720
I don't know the address.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.600
But I can show you.

34:41.720 --> 34:43.600
Can I help you?

34:43.600 --> 34:47.160
Mrs Webb?
Yes? What do you want?

34:47.160 --> 34:48.880
My husband's not in.Not to worry,

34:48.880 --> 34:51.120
we're looking for Kate Goddall.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.600
You must have the wrong address.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.520
Kate.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.120
No. You can't go in there.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.480
Kate. Are you all right?

35:01.480 --> 35:05.600
I'm calling the police. Good,
I was about to do that myself.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.040
Are you sure you're all right?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.280
I'm OK. How did you find me?

35:13.320 --> 35:14.960
Thank you.

35:14.960 --> 35:18.640
Can we go now?
This place gives me the creeps.

35:18.640 --> 35:22.280
Of course we can. Don't worry,
you're safe now.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.120
I've just spoken
to Sergeant Goodfellow.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.960
He's going to meet us at Langley
Hall. Tell them what you told me.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.600
I had an arrangement to make cash
payments to Helen Delaney.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.800
We should get back right away.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.040
Yes.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.640
I think a reckoning is due.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.440
I told you, I've done nothing wrong.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.520
This way please, Miss Delaney.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.800
Sergeant Goodfellow, wait.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.840
Miss Delaney's right,
she's entirely innocent.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.720
It's Miss Harris you should arrest.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.440
Excuse me?

36:02.440 --> 36:03.880
With respect, Father,

36:03.880 --> 36:06.360
it's Miss Delaney who's been
receiving payments.

36:06.360 --> 36:09.480
Well, that's what Miss Harris would
like you all to think.

36:09.480 --> 36:13.080
But it's Miss Harris who's been
abusing her position.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.240
Exploiting young girls on their
release from borstal.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.000
And her scheme was working well,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.400
until Brenda came back unexpectedly
to tell her tale

36:21.400 --> 36:24.000
and her ordeal in Gloucester.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.080
I'll call you back.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.920
Who were you talking to?

36:34.800 --> 36:37.600
Miss Watson's suspicions were
aroused,

36:37.600 --> 36:39.640
and that's the real reason she
admonished you

36:39.640 --> 36:41.600
on the day of the murder.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.200
And the reason why you decided
to kill her,

36:44.200 --> 36:45.960
and frame Brenda for her murder.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.000
Oh, this is absurd.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.280
All you needed was an event
with plenty of witnesses,

36:51.280 --> 36:52.920
like Bunty's talk.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.040
You asked for Brenda
to be released from confinement,

36:57.040 --> 36:59.320
and then you planted
the compact on her,

36:59.320 --> 37:02.600
that you'd taken from Bunty's bag.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.920
Promise me
you'll be on your best behaviour.

37:05.920 --> 37:10.560
You knew she'd make a public scene
and be confined again.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.320
You also knew that she would run
away when you unlocked the door.

37:14.320 --> 37:18.160
The perfect
scapegoat for your crime.

37:18.160 --> 37:22.040
Then you lured Miss Watson
to her death.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.880
Where is she?

37:32.880 --> 37:35.080
I locked her in.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.520
You disposed of the keys

37:40.520 --> 37:44.000
and then forced Kate to point
the finger at Brenda.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.160
No doubt you threatened
to report Joe if she refused.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.160
Brenda, I'm so sorry.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.120
I'll tell them everything.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.200
We both will.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.200
Good luck getting a jury
to believe either of you.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.360
As for the murder,
what evidence do you have?

38:06.360 --> 38:10.360
You're wearing it, around your neck.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.520
The gold,
which you claim is fake,

38:13.520 --> 38:15.760
is slightly tarnished.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.960
I suspect because it's been cleaned
with household bleach,

38:19.960 --> 38:22.560
to remove blood from the necklace.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.680
But there's no proof, Father.
The blood will be long gone.

38:25.680 --> 38:30.440
Indeed.
But it proves the gold was real.

38:30.440 --> 38:34.160
You couldn't bear
to dispose of anything of value,

38:34.160 --> 38:37.360
which is why you also kept your
watch.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.160
I'm not wearing a watch.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.360
But you were on the day of
the murder.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.000
A leather watch strap flecked
with blood

38:45.000 --> 38:47.480
would have to be replaced.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.560
And I wonder, if your room were
searched,

38:50.560 --> 38:53.880
it mightn't be found somewhere,
tucked away.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.560
Kate, grab her bag.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.840
Miss Harris,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

39:03.840 --> 39:06.280
of the murder of Miss Cecilia
Watson.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.840
You are not obliged to say anything,

39:07.840 --> 39:10.440
but anything you say may be given in
evidence. This way please.

39:17.520 --> 39:21.440
I suppose I should congratulate you
on your cleverness, Father.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.840
It's not often I find a match
to mine.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.720
Cleverness is a blessing.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.800
But without compassion,
it can be dangerous.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.240
Do you have any remorse
for killing Miss Watson?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.600
Not really.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.240
It wasn't personal.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.800
She just got in the way.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.240
In the way of your love
of material things?

39:46.240 --> 39:48.960
We can't all take
a vow of poverty, Father.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.760
But to condemn the girls to it
for your profit,

39:52.760 --> 39:54.720
how is that conscionable?

39:54.720 --> 39:58.080
Please. I was doing them a favour,

39:58.080 --> 40:01.240
finding them employment
and a roof over their heads.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.680
A pretty thankless task,
much of the time.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.080
And yet you stayed.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.480
It wasn't really the money, was it?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.880
You enjoyed your power over them.

40:13.880 --> 40:17.000
No more than I'd enjoy
herding sheep.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.800
Come on, Father,

40:18.800 --> 40:21.360
you and I both know they're
a lost cause.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.120
I don't believe in lost causes,

40:26.120 --> 40:27.960
only lost souls.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.560
And if you do not repent your crime,

40:32.560 --> 40:35.080
then I fear that it is you
who is lost.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.640
Would you like me to kneel
and beg God for forgiveness?

40:38.640 --> 40:43.520
Perhaps shed a tear or two?

40:43.520 --> 40:46.600
Thanks, but I think I'll save that
performance for the trial.

40:48.720 --> 40:53.280
I hope in time you will feel guilt
for what you have done.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.200
In the meantime,
I will pray for you.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.400
Thank you for a lovely
service, Father.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.760
It was my pleasure.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.360
And can I shake your hand,
Sergeant?

41:08.360 --> 41:10.160
Thank you.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.040
You're the one he should be
thanking, Father.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.920
Nonsense.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.680
You practised impeccable
judgment throughout.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.560
And if I may say so, Sergeant,

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
you're wasted in uniform.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.840
And not just a wedding
to celebrate.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.240
Congratulations,
Governor Delaney.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.640
I'm just glad I can finally do these
girls some good.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.720
And we now have a full-time teacher,
thanks to Bunty's generosity.

41:36.720 --> 41:41.440
Oh, please, I simply planned a party
and call it a fundraiser.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.920
They get to see you all the time.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.160
I know, you're right,
I'm being a poor friend.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.960
No, you're not.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.640
I hear you're eligible for release.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.160
Yeah, but Miss Delaney says
I can stay

41:51.160 --> 41:53.960
till I've finished reading my
studies.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.360
New teacher's dead strict though,
calls me a chatterbox.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.320
I hope you haven't put
a dead mouse in her desk.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.440
No. Course not.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.840
It were a live one.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.760
UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

42:04.360 --> 42:07.760
Oh.

42:07.760 --> 42:12.440
