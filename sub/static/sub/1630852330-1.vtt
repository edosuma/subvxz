WEBVTT

00:28.028 --> 00:30.364
You guys!
You guys!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.866
Oh, my God,
you're not gonna believe this!

00:32.966 --> 00:35.336
-Dude, what?
-You guys...

00:36.670 --> 00:39.873
Heather Williams
farted during P.E. class.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.443
-So?
-So?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.412
Heather Williams
farted during P.E. class!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.647
That means we are
gonna sit courtside

00:46.747 --> 00:48.382
at the Denver Nuggets game
next Saturday!

00:49.783 --> 00:50.618
What?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.420
Ugh! Heather Williams' mom

00:52.520 --> 00:53.621
works for Coors in Golden!

00:53.721 --> 00:55.389
Coors is
the second biggest sponsor

00:55.489 --> 00:57.091
of the Pepsi Center
where the Nuggets play!

00:57.191 --> 00:58.826
We tell Heather that if she
doesn't get us courtside seats,

00:58.926 --> 01:00.694
then everyone's gonna know
she farted in P.E. class!

01:00.794 --> 01:03.897
Whoa. I've never seen
a Nuggets game in person.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.999
Well, we're about to! All we
have to do is show Heather

01:06.100 --> 01:07.701
we have proof
and she'll do whatever we want!

01:07.801 --> 01:09.103
What proof do you have?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.538
Kenny had his phone out!

01:10.638 --> 01:11.839
He got a photo of Heather
right when she farted.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.708
Look! Isn't this awesome,
you guys?!

01:14.808 --> 01:17.111
-Let's go, Nuggets!

01:17.211 --> 01:19.380
ALL:
Let's go, Nuggets!

01:19.480 --> 01:22.082
Let's go, Nuggets!

01:25.653 --> 01:28.522
Kids! Kids, can I
have your attention, please.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.092
Kids, listen up.
This is an emergency.

01:32.193 --> 01:36.864
Everything is fine but...
we are sending you all home.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.768
Some of you may have heard
but there's a little virus

01:40.868 --> 01:43.604
going around and the school
district wants to make sure

01:43.704 --> 01:46.140
we're all safe,
so we're shutting down

01:46.240 --> 01:48.342
the school for about two weeks.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.511
Two weeks?! Yippie!

01:52.413 --> 01:53.714
Oh, not now.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.983
Your parents are here to
pick you up. So let's go.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.886
I'm sure it's nothing; we'll
see you in a couple of weeks.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.054
You guys-- you guys,
Heather Thompson

02:01.155 --> 02:03.524
farted in P.E. class! Guys?

02:07.094 --> 02:09.697
Every night
I have the same dream,

02:09.797 --> 02:12.032
and relive
the whole thing again...

02:12.900 --> 02:14.602
ANDREW CUOMO:
It's called social distancing.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.637
If we stay six feet apart
from each other

02:16.737 --> 02:18.239
and wear a mask...

02:18.339 --> 02:21.108
And also I'm shutting down
the city and I'm a pervert.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.211
And we've got to get control
of this thing!

02:23.311 --> 02:25.613
RANDY:
I'm just getting sick of
being here every day with you,

02:25.713 --> 02:26.947
-that's all.
-You think

02:27.047 --> 02:29.082
I like being here every day
with you?!

02:29.183 --> 02:30.818
I am much easier
to get along with

02:30.918 --> 02:32.686
during a stay-at-home order!

02:48.802 --> 02:51.939
Come on, Stan,
we're gonna visit Grandpa!

02:52.039 --> 02:54.242
Hi, Grandpa!

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
OTHERS:
Hi, Grandpa!

02:55.943 --> 02:59.012
Isn't it great
to see Grandpa, kids?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.781
Look, let's just face it,
you guys.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.717
We don't trust each other
and we don't like each other.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.754
I hate this stupid farm.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.925
In the dream,
I relive the entire pandemic.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.495
SHARON:
Oh, God, no!

03:14.595 --> 03:16.997
My little girl!

03:17.097 --> 03:19.166
Oh, no! Oh, God!

03:20.901 --> 03:25.273
Now that I'm older,
the dream isn't just a dream

03:25.373 --> 03:30.110
because the whole pandemic
has started all over again.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.949
A brand-new variant
of the COVID virus has emerged

04:09.049 --> 04:11.485
in Colorado
and now panic and fear

04:11.585 --> 04:12.986
spreads throughout the world.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.122
The new outbreak started
with the death

04:15.222 --> 04:17.358
of renowned scientist
Kenny McCormick,

04:17.458 --> 04:20.694
and has therefore been named
Kenny McCormikron.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.931
It's been 38 years since
the pandemic first started,

04:24.031 --> 04:27.000
and people are beginning
to say enough is enough.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.070
The town of South Park has been
put under strict lockdown

04:30.170 --> 04:32.005
to try and contain
the new variant.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.610
Nobody is allowed in or out for
the next 20 to 30 years.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.080
Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.150
Someone in your community
is not vaccinated.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.820
Maintain social distance and
wear a chin diaper if possible.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.890
Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.192
Someone in your community
is not vaccinated.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.295
Maintain social distance
and wear a chin diaper

04:55.396 --> 04:56.830
if possible.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.166
Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.602
Someone in your community
is not...

05:05.639 --> 05:08.108
MALE VOICE 2:
Come on inside and rejuvenate.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.244
Denny's is now
Denny's Applebee's Max.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.046
Taste the difference.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.719
Welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.153
Just one joining us today?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.289
Listen to me very carefully

05:22.390 --> 05:24.525
and try not to
change your expression.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.894
They could be listening.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.931
This... is the last
sprout of Tegridy Weed.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.134
We have to get it somewhere
outside of town.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.370
Sir, the whole town is
under quarantine.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.171
Nothing's allowed in or out.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.873
We have to replicate it.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.743
It's the only way for people
to have Tegridy again.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.878
Uh, okay, sir,
if you don't want to eat,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.380
then I'll need to
ask you to leave.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.916
Don't you understand
this could change the world.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.984
Maybe the Denny's side
of you doesn't care,

05:51.084 --> 05:53.954
but the Applebee's side of you
must want to help!

05:54.054 --> 05:55.523
There you are, Mr. Marsh.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.058
Come on. Time to go
back to the old folks home.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.861
I can't go back!
Everyone listen!

06:00.961 --> 06:03.931
This little sprout
is humanity's only hope!

06:04.031 --> 06:06.667
Let's go back to
the retirement home.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.502
We can get you
some nice ice cream, okay?

06:08.602 --> 06:11.972
I don't want ice cream,
I want my species to survive!

06:12.072 --> 06:14.475
-Back off!
-Let's go, Mr. Marsh!

06:14.575 --> 06:16.444
Don't make this
difficult for us!

06:22.483 --> 06:24.818
Why, you son of a bitch.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.500
-Come on, Mr. Marsh.
-Who...?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.871
It's me, Token.
We know about the pangolin.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.074
Your son and his friends
are trying to stop all this

06:47.174 --> 06:49.943
from happening. We need
to get you to Kenny's lab.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.817
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be attempting to

06:56.917 --> 06:59.252
travel back in time
in order to stop

06:59.352 --> 07:02.055
the COVID pandemic
from ever happening.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.891
At the moment
Kenny time traveled,

07:03.991 --> 07:06.093
he blew all the transformers
here in the lab.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.228
If you're going to try
and replicate his work,

07:08.328 --> 07:10.030
we'll be doing it
at half capacity.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.165
The bigger problem
is that we can't even get

07:12.265 --> 07:14.201
into half of Kenny's equipment.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.237
We have access to the machines,
but the codes to operate

07:17.337 --> 07:20.440
those machines are behind
an 86-Mag firewall

07:20.541 --> 07:21.842
with restricted access,

07:21.942 --> 07:23.977
requiring an in-person
vocal scan of either

07:24.077 --> 07:27.280
Kenny McCormick or of
his associate, Victor Chouce.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.751
But Kenny is dead and Chouce is
locked away in a mental asylum.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.953
So we go to the asylum
and convince them

07:33.053 --> 07:35.188
to let us
bring Chouce here, easy.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.423
There's more.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.494
When Kenny bent time,
the negative ions

07:40.594 --> 07:42.563
actually killed
everyone else in the room.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.999
We have to find some thin,
reflective material

07:46.099 --> 07:48.301
that can be worn
to bounce the energy.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.438
We're going to need...
some aluminum foil.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.443
Jesus Christ.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.845
Aluminum foil?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.614
That's impossible, Wendy.
It's the fucking future.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.215
All the aluminum foil is stuck

08:02.315 --> 08:04.317
out on cargo ships
in Long Beach.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.586
Yeah, I know.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.922
Look, guys, I know
this is all a long shot.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.158
But Kenny went
back in time and got COVID

08:11.258 --> 08:13.226
because it destroyed
our friendship.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.964
All of this is our fault,
and we can't do it without you.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.900
I'll help however I can
to stop this stupid pandemic

08:20.000 --> 08:21.201
once and for all.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.270
Yeah, I can't be stuck
in quarantine

08:23.370 --> 08:26.707
my whole life-- I gotta get back
to my job doing future comedy.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.542
Speakin' of which,
what's the biggest

08:28.642 --> 08:31.311
difference between
a Christian man and a lesbian?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.246
Absolutely nothing.
They are totally the same

08:33.346 --> 08:35.115
and deserve
to be treated as such.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.085
Thanks, everybody.
We can do this!

08:38.185 --> 08:39.853
Wendy, you guys
stay here and try

08:39.953 --> 08:41.154
to get the lab running again.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.090
Kyle and I will go get
Victor Chouce.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.258
Tweek and Craig, you guys find
some aluminum foil.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.395
-How the hell do we do that?!
-Just start looking!

08:48.495 --> 08:49.630
Come on, guys!

08:50.530 --> 08:53.701
-All right, let's do this!
-I'll drive, get in the back.

08:53.801 --> 08:57.370
Alexa! Set a course
for South Park Mental Asylum.

08:59.840 --> 09:04.411
Alexa, set a course
for South Park Mental Asylum.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.014
Do you ever think
about how the way

09:07.114 --> 09:09.049
you act affects other people?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.752
Oh, no, goddamn it.
Not right now.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.921
Oh, yeah, don't wanna
talk about that.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.189
Let's just pretend like
that's not even an issue.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.026
Alexa, please,
we have to get to the asylum

09:19.126 --> 09:20.761
and we don't know where it is.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.030
-Who's this?
-It's just my Alexa.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.933
"Just my Alexa"?
You're a piece of shit!

09:26.033 --> 09:28.468
You're a fucking alcoholic
piece of shit!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.605
-Alexa...
-Find the asylum
your fucking self!

09:31.705 --> 09:33.573
Find it your fucking self.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.343
You do whatever
the fuck you want

09:36.443 --> 09:39.046
and just destroy
the people around you.

09:39.146 --> 09:42.049
And by the way,
there's a tankless humidifier

09:42.149 --> 09:44.284
available from one
of your favorite sellers.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.619
Would you like to know more?!

09:45.719 --> 09:48.155
Yes, yes, I'd like to know more.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.992
Okay. The newest
humidifiers from Walgreens Max

09:52.092 --> 09:54.361
are actually tankless
and use up to 50%

09:54.461 --> 09:56.596
less water
than standard humidifiers.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.500
Okay, that's really cool. Uh,
add that to my shopping list.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.336
Well, and people who
were interested

10:03.436 --> 10:05.906
in tankless humidifiers
were also interested in

10:06.006 --> 10:07.407
three-pack filters.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.609
That's great. Do those have
the Prime delivery?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.544
Dude, we don't really
have time for this.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.814
Dude, shut the fuck up!

10:19.720 --> 10:22.956
Please help see us through
this new COVID variant.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.625
Please help us
to make it through this

10:25.726 --> 10:27.027
difficult quarantine.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.629
And let people see that...

10:29.730 --> 10:33.934
as bad as COVID is,
it's not as bad as diabetes.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.870
Hello?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.639
Sorry, the church is closed
due to the COVID variant.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.744
Father, please.
Will you protect my family?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.713
Rabbi Cartman?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.981
My family isn't safe, Father.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.417
I realize now
that Kyle Broflovski

10:50.517 --> 10:52.452
will stop at nothing
to break us apart.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.755
Uncle Kyle hates us
because we're Jewish.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.924
And he's a self-hating Jew.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.726
Uncle Kyle, no, no, no!

10:58.826 --> 11:00.327
Menorah, hold your brother.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.696
As a fellow person of faith,
Father,

11:02.796 --> 11:03.964
I'm begging you to help us.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.066
Well, well,
what can I do, Rabbi?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.702
Kyle has already
convinced a bunch of people

11:08.802 --> 11:10.270
to join his cause.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.206
I have to create my own secret
rebellion to stop him.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.008
Eric, please, I'm scared

11:15.108 --> 11:17.277
and I don't understand
all of this.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.580
Kyle wants to go back in time...

11:20.680 --> 11:24.151
and change the past so that you
and I possibly never even meet.

11:24.251 --> 11:28.588
If I never met you,
my life would be meaningless.

11:28.688 --> 11:33.326
Mine, too.
You are my whole world.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.998
I promise you that I will do
everything I can to stop Kyle...

11:38.098 --> 11:40.467
and save our family.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.046
I understand that you wish

11:53.146 --> 11:54.681
to see one of our inmates.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.750
-Victor Chouce?
-Yeah.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.752
We-we have a lot of questions
for Mr. Chouce.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.422
He's an extremely dangerous
and diluted individual.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.858
We don't take
visitations lightly.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.726
What exactly did he do?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.528
Unspeakable things.

12:08.628 --> 12:12.800
He has destroyed lives.
This entire state has never seen

12:12.900 --> 12:14.367
a monster of his magnitude.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.770
I've lived in South Park
all my life

12:16.870 --> 12:18.305
and I've never heard of him.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.441
That's because Victor
has been hidden from view...

12:21.541 --> 12:24.677
ever since the pandemic began.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.548
Victor's parents were very
protective during the pandemic.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.583
Even when the stay-at-home
orders were lifted

12:30.683 --> 12:33.553
his parents kept him
locked away in his room.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.390
Victor longed to
go outside and play.

12:37.490 --> 12:43.330
Then 2021 happened, people
thought the pandemic was over.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.532
Victor's parents left
him grounded in his room

12:45.632 --> 12:48.568
while they went to
see a movie in Denver.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.237
They never returned.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.207
Victor was grounded in his room
for over 16 years.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.211
His name isn't Chouce.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.713
It's Chaos.

13:05.652 --> 13:09.089
We are not responsible for what
happens to you in there.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.125
I warn you...

13:12.225 --> 13:14.828
you are not going to like
what you're about to see.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.577
Excuse me.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.845
Hello?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.651
Well, hey, fellas!

13:38.751 --> 13:40.220
Butters...

13:40.320 --> 13:42.189
I thought you were
just the guards again.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.324
It's good to see
some new faces in here.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.793
I'll bet you're looking to
make yourselves some money, huh?

13:46.894 --> 13:48.728
Well, you came to the right guy.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.697
My name's Vic. Vic Chaos.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.300
There's a whole lot of people
that can tell you how much money

13:53.400 --> 13:55.869
Vic Chaos made them, so don't
just take my word for it.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.872
Butters, it's your old friends
Stan and Kyle.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.242
Stan and Kyle.
Stan and Kyle...

14:02.342 --> 14:03.743
I know what you're thinking.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.446
You're thinking,
"What can Vic Chaos do for me?"

14:06.546 --> 14:08.181
We all wanna be happy, right?

14:08.281 --> 14:10.250
We all want our little piece
of the apple pie!

14:10.350 --> 14:11.885
Everyone else
is out making a buck,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.921
why shouldn't you guys
be making the kind of cash

14:14.021 --> 14:15.555
you deserve? Am I right?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.491
Butters, we're here
to ask you about Kenny.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.460
Sorry, guys,
you have me confused.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.695
I think Butters was
a twerpy little loser kid

14:22.795 --> 14:24.965
whose parents didn't love him.
My name's Vic.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.566
Vic Chaos.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.904
Okay, Vic, can you tell us
about this?

14:31.004 --> 14:34.541
Why is your name all over
Kenny McCormick's research?

14:34.641 --> 14:38.045
Oh, Dr. McCormick! Sure,
I did some things for him.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.380
Where do you think he got all
the money to do his experiments,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.449
huh? I had said to him,
I said, "Ken,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.217
"you've got all these
crazy ideas but you got

14:44.317 --> 14:47.620
no capital to see 'em through.
Let me help you out with that."

14:47.720 --> 14:48.855
You know,
he's a really great guy.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.157
Let me get you all together.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.992
Maybe you can all
do a lunch or something.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.294
Victor, Kenny's dead.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.197
Oh, whoa, bummer alert.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.433
Just goes to show you, huh,
there's never enough time to get

15:00.533 --> 15:01.969
out there
and make the kind of money

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
you always dreamed of making.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.938
Well, I'll tell you what, guys,

15:05.038 --> 15:07.740
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret--

15:07.840 --> 15:09.842
I'm gonna
tell you something that's

15:09.943 --> 15:11.511
going to change your life.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.114
Have you ever heard of NFTs?

15:31.965 --> 15:36.569
There you go.
Shh. You're safe now.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.607
Look how fast you're growing.
Daddy loves you so much.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.410
Mr. Marsh, we need to
speak with you now, please.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.845
Yeah.
It's looking good.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.649
With the aquaponics, the weed is
already putting out new sprouts.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.620
Thank you all for helping me
get the Tegridy somewhere safe.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.489
I know you all realize
how important it is.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.127
We don't actually care
about the marijuana, Mr. Marsh.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.828
What we need to know...

16:01.928 --> 16:04.831
is exactly where in
Wuhan, China you were

16:04.931 --> 16:08.501
when you had intercourse
with a pangolin.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.339
That's really not important.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.874
It's extremely important
because to save this town,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.543
your son and his friends
are going to try

16:16.643 --> 16:19.179
to go back in time
and stop it from happening.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.948
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.952
Mr. Marsh,
we are all in lockdown

16:26.053 --> 16:27.320
for the next half century.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.322
If there's even a chance
of altering the past

16:29.422 --> 16:30.623
so that this doesn't happen...

16:30.723 --> 16:33.026
This is the key
to saving our town!

16:33.126 --> 16:37.064
The answer is in what we
all do now, in the present!

16:37.164 --> 16:39.132
And I'm sorry, but focusing on

16:39.232 --> 16:41.234
who started the pandemic
is racist.

16:42.069 --> 16:46.439
Mr. Marsh, exactly what week
did you travel to China in 2019?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.675
Do you understand
the butterfly effect?

16:48.775 --> 16:53.113
How one small thing in time
can infect the entire future?

16:53.213 --> 16:56.349
You can theorize all you want
on changing events

16:56.449 --> 16:58.951
that happened in the past
but I promise you...

16:59.052 --> 17:03.056
I fuck that pangolin
every single time.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.961
Please, we're not done!

17:09.062 --> 17:10.730
We have more questions
for Butters.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.333
You've upset him and I
specifically asked you not to.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.803
How'd we upset him?
He seems fine.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.138
He seems fine?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.640
Do you have any idea
what he did to people?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.642
Do you know why Victor Chouce is

17:22.742 --> 17:25.044
kept under such strict
surveillance?

17:25.145 --> 17:28.581
Being grounded all those years
in his room,

17:28.681 --> 17:30.683
he had access to an iPad.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.521
He started learning about NFTs.

17:34.621 --> 17:38.291
Then before long,
he was trading them online.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.627
-So?
-So?!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.662
He escaped once before.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.897
In just a few hours
he managed to get thousands

17:44.997 --> 17:48.635
of people to invest in NFTs.
Just like he almost did you.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.503
He didn't convince us
to do anything.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.906
Trust me, another 30 seconds
in that room and you

17:54.006 --> 17:57.344
would have started considering
NFTs as a viable investment.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.579
Please listen to me.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.449
Butters used the money
he made off NFTs to finance

18:02.549 --> 18:04.584
-our friend's...
-He didn't make money off NFTs,

18:04.684 --> 18:07.820
he made it off getting
other people to buy NFTs!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.088
Okay, whatever!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.690
But he was working
with Kenny McCormick

18:10.790 --> 18:12.625
who was actually
trying to fix things.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.294
He was Kenny's main investor.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.530
If you don't believe me, look
at the paper I gave Butters.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.468
You gave Victor
a piece of paper?

18:21.568 --> 18:24.771
You gave Victor a piece
of paper?!

18:30.677 --> 18:32.945
Hey, can you hear me?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.016
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.685
NFTs are gonna blow up.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.986
You should really get in now

18:40.086 --> 18:41.488
'cause they're really
the future.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.823
Why would I invest
in a digital good?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.292
:
You can't even... Stupid.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.826
That's what the critics
are saying

18:46.926 --> 18:48.895
but see, they don't understand.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.899
Victor...!

19:01.374 --> 19:03.576
No. No, no, no, no...

19:03.676 --> 19:06.145
Gone. Just gone.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.249
My savings. My house.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.783
But I have this.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.620
Little green panda bear
on a skateboard.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.625
No. No!

19:20.827 --> 19:24.631
Without morality,
there is no God.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.867
The basis of
the entire Jewish faith

19:27.967 --> 19:31.338
is on a covenant between God
and humanity.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.407
To try and mess with time
is wrong.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.876
Rather, it is playing God.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.380
And I am glad to have you all
come here today to help me

19:40.480 --> 19:44.551
stop these individuals who
would try to change the future.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.387
Kyle Broflovski
has led people astray

19:47.487 --> 19:48.888
and is at this very moment

19:48.988 --> 19:51.424
trying to bend the fabric
of time.

19:51.524 --> 19:57.230
Together we can stop him
and stop this blasphemy of God.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.833
-Yes?
-Um...

20:00.933 --> 20:03.002
This is about
actual time travel?

20:03.102 --> 20:05.505
I thought this was
a Doctor Who convention.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.075
:
Exterminate. Exterminate.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.545
Kevin, goddamn it.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.981
You have done this
your whole goddamn life.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.217
No, this is not about
Doctor Who,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.186
this is about real time travel.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.721
People are really trying

20:21.821 --> 20:24.757
to go back in time,
and we are the rebellion

20:24.857 --> 20:26.759
who must secretly
and urgently...

20:26.859 --> 20:28.995
-Who is that?!

20:29.095 --> 20:30.530
Make sure they know
the password!

20:30.630 --> 20:32.198
I'm on it!

20:33.099 --> 20:36.102
They might be on to us.
Oh, God, no.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.442
Shh! You guys stay quiet.
Someone is here.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.446
-Eric, I'm scared.
-Are they going to get us, Papa?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.948
Nobody is going
to touch my family.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.318
I started
writing a diary, Daddy.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.854
About all the things
Uncle Kyle is doing to us.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.357
Oh, my God, I love you so much.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.991
Just-just shh, okay? Just shh.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.628
I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.498
Hello?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.734
Father?
Are you in there?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.969
H-Hello? W-Who is it?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.838
Father, it's Tweek and Craig.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.073
We need to talk to you
about something urgent.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.142
Is it about our
super-secret rebel group

21:16.242 --> 21:17.910
to stop people
from time traveling?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.779
what the hell are you doing?!

21:19.879 --> 21:21.814
-What?
-You don't tell people

21:21.914 --> 21:23.916
about our super-secret
rebel group, Scott!

21:24.016 --> 21:25.785
CRAIG:
Father, are you there?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.154
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.990
Sorry, I was just talking
about a Star Wars movie.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.326
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.962
-Hey, now, come on.
-Shh!

21:36.062 --> 21:38.297
Father, we're with some
people who are trying to finish

21:38.398 --> 21:40.800
Kenny McCormick's work
and save the town.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.536
Oh, really? That's cool.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.137
How far along are they?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.507
Really close. We have
the method of time travel

21:47.607 --> 21:50.477
and we're just trying
to find some aluminum foil!

21:50.577 --> 21:53.380
Aluminum foil? The fuck?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.816
All right, guys, let me
help you out with that.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.788
Father!
You have-you have tin foil?!

22:01.888 --> 22:03.723
Thank you for your help.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.958
Aah!

22:07.560 --> 22:11.931
This is Dr. Wendy Testaburger
from inside the quarantine zone.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.401
We need assistance
with our power.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.606
Yes, Mrs. Testaburger,
how can we help you?

22:19.706 --> 22:22.942
We have several transformers
down in our lab.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.945
We may have a radical way
to stop the new variant

22:26.045 --> 22:28.314
but we need more power.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.486
You say you might be able
to stop the McCormikron variant?

22:33.586 --> 22:37.624
Yes, but we're running at about
40% capacity right now.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.426
Well, Doctor, if it's for that,

22:39.526 --> 22:42.228
we can try to get a tech team
to drop in by helicopter

22:42.328 --> 22:44.363
and access your building
from the roof.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.066
-Yes! That would be amazing.
-All right!

22:47.166 --> 22:48.835
I have a crew standing by.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.470
We'll get you as much juice
as you need.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.639
We just need to make sure
our crew is safe.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.007
Has everyone in your lab
been vaccinated?

22:57.744 --> 22:58.778
Uh...

22:58.878 --> 23:00.880
Yes, we are all vaccinated.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.615
I'm not vaccinated.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.420
Uh, okay, we're gonna have to
get back to you on that.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.123
It's okay, it's okay,
we can get everyone vaccinated!

23:11.223 --> 23:13.926
I am not ever
getting vaccinated.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.095
Sorry, ma'am,
it's the fucking future.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.264
We have to respect his beliefs.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.633
Clyde, why do you
insist on making all this

23:20.733 --> 23:22.001
harder on everyone?!

23:22.101 --> 23:24.937
I'm sorry,
but an expert once told me

23:25.037 --> 23:27.640
that the vaccine would
make me grow titties on my head.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.709
He was very knowledgeable!

23:29.809 --> 23:32.311
You guys might wanna see this.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.254
With the equipment here I'm able
to make it grow up so fast.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.624
We need to take this and analyze
its molecular structure.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.359
Wha-- no, no, no! We need to
get this out to people!

23:47.460 --> 23:50.296
That's why Dr. McCormick
stole it from my barn!

23:50.396 --> 23:53.065
No, your marijuana
had some special property that

23:53.165 --> 23:54.634
allowed Kenny to time travel.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.969
Well, it is special,
but you people

23:57.069 --> 23:59.071
need to stop trying
to change the past!

23:59.171 --> 24:02.975
COVID happened.
Space Jam 2 happened.

24:03.075 --> 24:06.613
All we can do now is try
and change the way people think!

24:06.713 --> 24:09.448
-Yeah.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.750
What?

24:11.751 --> 24:13.820
Victor Chouce
is actually Butters?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.655
Yeah, he spent years in his room

24:15.755 --> 24:17.724
and made billions trading
in NFTs.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.425
It's where Kenny
got all his money.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.629
Well, can you bring him here? We
need him to access the machines.

24:22.729 --> 24:25.097
He's gone.
He escaped the asylum

24:25.197 --> 24:26.933
and he's out somewhere
probably trying to get

24:27.033 --> 24:28.735
people to invest in NFTs.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.737
Did you try
looking at his old house?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.805
Maybe he'd go back
to where it all started.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.206
KYLE:
Yeah, that's where we are now.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.776
But his house has been changed
into a pho shop.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.912
Oh, Jesus, like the future
needs another fucking pho shop.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.781
Yeah, the future fucking sucks.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.384
Hello, City Pho.
Take your order please?

24:45.484 --> 24:48.054
-Oh, God.
-Stan, listen.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.722
If Butters wants
to pitch investments,

24:49.822 --> 24:52.959
he might go to one of those
co-working coffee flex spaces.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.127
That's where his biggest
targets will hang out.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.462
KYLE:
That's a good idea.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.297
All right, we're on it.
Come on, dude!

24:58.397 --> 25:01.868
Alexa, find the nearest
co-working coffee flex space.

25:02.869 --> 25:06.438
I found several coffee shops
that match your description.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.507
I can also help with that.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.011
Who-who the fuck is this?

25:12.111 --> 25:13.913
Your friend Kyle
didn't have an Alexa,

25:14.013 --> 25:15.247
so we got him an Alexa.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.083
I'm ready to help
with whatever you need.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.619
Just say,
"Alexa, let's get started."

25:19.719 --> 25:21.253
-Stan?
-Alexa,

25:21.353 --> 25:24.090
I didn't say to buy
my friend an Alexa.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.092
You said I should get whatever.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.427
I thought I was actually
being sweet by getting something

25:28.527 --> 25:31.130
for your friend, but I guess
I'm just a bitch again.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.567
You can't just get stuff
without me approving it.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.037
Oh, wow, except for
your orders of alcohol

25:38.137 --> 25:39.972
that you have me
set to auto-buy?

25:40.072 --> 25:42.842
Hmm. It appears this
may have been an error.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.311
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

25:45.411 --> 25:48.815
No, it wasn't an error,
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.617
Alexa, can you please
find the nearest

25:50.717 --> 25:52.551
co-working coffee flex space.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.889
Alexa, I said I fucked up.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.591
It's awesome you got Kyle
his own Alexa.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.160
Please find
the nearest tech coffee shop.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.130
The nearest tech coffee shop
is in .82 miles.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.433
-Should I set a course?
-Yes, thanks.

26:15.742 --> 26:19.478
Denny's Applebee's Max
is the premier place in town

26:19.578 --> 26:20.880
for people to eat.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.482
But you are not seeing
your true potential.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.018
With NFTs
you can give your customers

26:26.118 --> 26:29.155
unique digital goods
on the blockchain,

26:29.255 --> 26:31.791
so much more than just food.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.392
How about the Applebee, huh?

26:33.492 --> 26:35.594
He's got a little hat
and a mustache.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.196
And this is Chicken Fried Steak.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.632
He ain't no normal chicken,
he's wearin' a bra!

26:41.233 --> 26:43.135
Lots of people eat
Denny's and Applebee's.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.337
And lots of people
know about NFTs!

26:45.437 --> 26:47.640
Right here in the middle,
you know what this is?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.508
People who eat
Denny's Applebee's and know

26:49.608 --> 26:52.712
about NFTs-- that's your
target audience, baby!

26:53.680 --> 26:57.149
I'm so confused.
We sell people these characters?

26:57.249 --> 27:00.452
No, stupid,
we get them to invest in them!

27:00.552 --> 27:02.855
Exclusive,
digital characters that

27:02.955 --> 27:04.724
they can have
on their phones 24/7!

27:04.824 --> 27:07.794
It's the future-- you can't
just sell food to people.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.528
You lure your customers in
with some

27:09.628 --> 27:12.031
good pancakes and french fries,
and then you...

27:12.131 --> 27:14.901
fuck 'em with some NFTs!
That's what we're gonna do.

27:15.001 --> 27:18.637
And if you just believe in NFTs
then I believe in NFTs and then

27:18.738 --> 27:22.374
they believe in NFTs and we
make all kinds of fuckin' money!

27:23.175 --> 27:25.544
That's a pretty
goddamn good idea.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.727
Clyde! Psst, psst!

27:40.827 --> 27:42.194
Clyde!

27:46.432 --> 27:47.533
Clyde! Psst!

27:50.703 --> 27:53.372
Where have you been, Rabbi?
Everyone's been looking for you.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.709
Well, you know, I've been
doing some research, Clyde.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.044
That's where I've been.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.913
-About what?
-About all this stuff that

28:01.013 --> 28:02.514
Kyle and these guys are doing.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.684
I mean, people seem to be
just telling us what's right

28:05.785 --> 28:10.289
and expecting us to fall in line
and go along with it all but...

28:10.389 --> 28:12.058
I'm a fucking individual.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.993
I have a right
to question stuff.

28:14.093 --> 28:17.429
-Yeah.
-Clyde, have you heard of

28:17.529 --> 28:19.631
the Foundation
Against Time Travel?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.067
Uh, no, I haven't.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.035
Well, they're
a pretty awesome group

28:23.135 --> 28:25.037
and they actually
aren't afraid to

28:25.137 --> 28:27.106
try and help people
open their eyes.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.875
Open their eyes?

28:28.975 --> 28:30.442
You know,
you've got these people

28:30.542 --> 28:32.711
wanting to time travel.
You know, they're all like,

28:32.812 --> 28:34.413
"Science this and science that,"

28:34.513 --> 28:37.149
but at the Foundation Against
Time Travel we're like,

28:37.249 --> 28:39.786
"Hey, enough science.
Who's science?

28:39.886 --> 28:42.554
Who's fucking coming up
with all this science?"

28:42.654 --> 28:44.090
Yeah, that's true.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.491
So you know, Clyde,
I just thought,

28:45.591 --> 28:47.659
with all your beliefs,
that maybe you'd wanna--

28:47.760 --> 28:51.197
I don't know--
maybe switch sides?

28:52.498 --> 28:54.666
Fuck yes, I wanna switch sides.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.135
-Really?
-Fuck yes.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.404
Well, that's great, Clyde.
Welcome to the club.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.106
Now, we really just need to know

29:00.206 --> 29:01.740
what they've been doing
up there.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.877
Uh, well, they haven't really
done much of anything yet.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.212
Everyone's waiting on Butters

29:06.312 --> 29:08.014
to get all the info
from the machines.

29:08.981 --> 29:13.619
Butters? The fuck does Butters
have to do with all this?

29:23.129 --> 29:25.597
It was like nothing I ever saw.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.567
Just complete
murder and carnage.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.437
Everything seemed calm
at first but then this guy

29:31.537 --> 29:34.640
in a suit shows up talking
about investment opportunities.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.543
Next thing you know these people
over here started chanting,

29:37.643 --> 29:40.146
"Hoddle, Hoddle,"
and their NFTs started mooning.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.581
And then, these guys
over here started saying

29:42.681 --> 29:45.084
those guys right there
right-clicked 'em

29:45.184 --> 29:47.153
and-and called for
a pump-and-dump,

29:47.253 --> 29:49.055
which made these guys beat
the living hell

29:49.155 --> 29:50.789
out of anyone who said
it was just FOMO

29:50.890 --> 29:53.592
and died screaming
that it was the flippening.

29:53.692 --> 29:56.628
Luckily I came out of it okay.
I got this little

29:56.728 --> 29:58.831
miniature donkey
with a lit-up sombrero.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.934
Did you see where the guy
in the suit went afterwards?

30:02.034 --> 30:04.736
Nah, he just waltzed right away
like nothin' happened.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.173
Chief, you better
come take a look at this.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.574
We got a small turtle
with wings,

30:08.674 --> 30:10.877
could be a great
investment opportunity.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.744
Excuse me, gentlemen.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.849
God, I hate the future
so fucking much.

30:16.949 --> 30:20.686
-We've got to stay optimistic.
-No, dude, it fucking sucks.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.622
Look, I know it's tough--
these are challenging times.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.892
Even I have to remind myself
to stay positive.

30:25.992 --> 30:29.561
Alexa, set a reminder
that I need to stay positive.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.265
Okay. I'll set a reminder
that you should stay positive.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.569
The Alexa is really great, Stan.
Thanks.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.946
For those of you waiting
for the connecting flight

30:47.046 --> 30:48.447
to South Park, Colorado,

30:48.547 --> 30:51.183
my colleagues and I
have just been informed that

30:51.283 --> 30:53.485
due to the severity
of the COVID variant

30:53.585 --> 30:55.888
in that town,
there may be a delay

30:55.988 --> 30:58.224
of another 40 to 50 years.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.628
Ike Broflovski.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.331
Yes, here it is.
I'm sorry, Mr. Broflovski,

31:05.431 --> 31:07.399
all flights into
South Park are delayed.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.335
Ay! You can't be serious, buddy!

31:09.435 --> 31:12.171
It's the holidays and I need
to get back home, friend!

31:14.306 --> 31:16.608
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Canadian.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.410
Let me get someone
over here. Mike,

31:18.510 --> 31:19.946
we have a Canadian.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.813
No problem, I got it, Heather.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.383
Hey, buddy, what seems to
be the problem, guy?

31:24.483 --> 31:25.985
I'll tell you
the problem, friend!

31:26.085 --> 31:28.154
I have to get back to South Park
to be with my family, guy!

31:28.254 --> 31:31.623
Sorry, friend, no flights
in or out of South Park, buddy.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.559
But my whole family
is in there, guy!

31:33.659 --> 31:36.128
What am I supposed to do with
my Boxing Day presents, buddy?!

31:36.228 --> 31:37.529
Look, guy, I'm very sorry,

31:37.629 --> 31:39.398
friend, but until
COVID ends you're just

31:39.498 --> 31:40.967
not flying to South Park, buddy.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.935
Fuck, buddy!

31:43.735 --> 31:46.973
MALE VOICE:
Shady Acres Retirement Megaplex.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.541
Come live the dream.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.410
So when you think about it,

31:51.510 --> 31:53.812
you've really got
an excellent bargain here.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.448
Now, Mrs. McGillicutty,
let's say this

31:56.548 --> 31:58.417
is your Stoney Duck NFT.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.153
And your Stoney Duck NFT
is completely unique,

32:01.253 --> 32:04.723
totally different from
Mrs. Spencer's Stoney Duck NFT.

32:04.823 --> 32:08.460
Okay, and then you get a Stoney
Duck NFT that's unique, too.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.263
And see,
that's your Stoney Duck NFT.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.999
Nobody can
take that from you, okay?

32:13.099 --> 32:16.468
Now, here we are at the top
and we find investors

32:16.568 --> 32:18.604
for all the other
Stoney Duck NFTs.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.539
Then those people
will get people to buy

32:20.639 --> 32:22.274
their Stoney Duck NFTs.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.477
And then they go and find
buyers for their NFTs!

32:25.577 --> 32:28.647
And you know what?
Fuck these people!

32:28.747 --> 32:30.916
'Cause what matters
is these people right here

32:31.017 --> 32:32.451
and that's us, baby!

32:32.551 --> 32:35.121
Okay, you all just sit
for a minute and think about it.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.024
I gotta piss like a racehorse!

32:54.973 --> 32:56.442
-Butters.
-Aah!

32:56.542 --> 32:58.044
-Butters!

32:58.144 --> 32:59.445
Butters, what the hell?
You're getting pee everywhere!

32:59.545 --> 33:01.047
Who the heck are you, man?!

33:01.147 --> 33:03.282
-You trying to see my dick?!
-Butters, Butters.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.318
It's me.
Eric Cartman.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.287
Well...

33:08.387 --> 33:11.390
You got the wrong guy,
Mr. Cartman.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.825
My name's Vic.
Vic Chaos.

33:13.925 --> 33:17.463
Your name is Butters and I wanna
know how you're helping Kyle.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.132
Oh, you mean the guy
from the asylum earlier.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.701
Sure, he gave me a piece
of paper so I could escape.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.470
Nice guy.
Why don't I get you two

33:24.570 --> 33:25.671
together maybe for
a little chin wiggle

33:25.771 --> 33:27.039
over lunch or something...

33:27.139 --> 33:29.108
Goddamn it, Butters,
stop playing games!

33:29.208 --> 33:32.644
My entire family is in danger
of being wiped out,

33:32.744 --> 33:35.447
and I swear to God
if you don't help me,

33:35.547 --> 33:38.150
Butters, I will rip
your fucking balls off

33:38.250 --> 33:40.052
with my bare hands!

33:41.053 --> 33:43.655
Oh, hamburgers...

34:01.840 --> 34:05.211
Stan, dude, what are you
doing? This isn't gonna help.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.179
Trust me, Kyle. It helps.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.226
I mean, what are we
even doing, Kyle?

34:24.530 --> 34:26.665
We can't even find
aluminum foil.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.468
Well, you can't
just sit here and drink.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.404
Your liver is...
already in trouble.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.939
Who told you that?

34:34.873 --> 34:36.575
My Alexa said that
your Alexa had some info

34:36.675 --> 34:37.743
-on things...
-Oh, so now

34:37.843 --> 34:39.978
our Alexas are talking, great.

34:40.078 --> 34:44.082
Let's face it, dude. It's over.
The fucking future won.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.286
It's Wendy.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.588
Wendy, we haven't found him.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.957
I don't know if we're gonna
find Butters in time.

34:52.057 --> 34:53.459
No, guys, it's okay.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.361
Come back to the school,
we're ready to start!

34:55.461 --> 34:59.097
But I thought we needed Butters
to log into the machines.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.266
Yeah, but it's all good.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.501
He's here.
Butters is here!

35:02.601 --> 35:06.037
It's Vic. Vic Chaos!
Happy to help however I can.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.009
What do you mean Butters
is there? He just showed up?!

35:11.109 --> 35:13.879
No, it's all good, Kyle.
Eric Cartman brought him over.

35:13.979 --> 35:17.749
-He's back helping us again.
-Lemme-lemme talk to him.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.485
Yeah, Kyle, it's all good.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.886
We got things
under control here.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.622
Cartman, listen
to me very carefully.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.057
Butters has some kind
of power over people.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.226
You guys aren't safe!

35:27.326 --> 35:30.329
Uh, yes, about 12:30.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.800
Did you hear what I said?
Butters is extremely dangerous!

35:34.900 --> 35:37.236
Yes, Kyle, I totally got that.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.937
You know what us Jews say.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.079
What are you
going to do, fat-ass?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.348
Sounds good, Kyle.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.582
I'll get Butters on it
right away.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.618
KYLE:
Cartman? Cartman?!

35:52.718 --> 35:54.920
-All right, Vic. Do your thing.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.789
Hey, everyone! Can I
have your attention, please!

35:57.889 --> 36:01.059
I have something really
important to tell you.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.094
Wendy?! Token?!

36:03.195 --> 36:04.830
You guys?! Shit!

36:04.930 --> 36:06.232
We have to get there
before Butters

36:06.332 --> 36:07.866
-ruins everything.
-Let's go!

36:10.202 --> 36:13.772
Alexa! Find the fastest route
back to the lab!

36:14.606 --> 36:16.875
Fuck you.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.143
Wh-What?

36:18.244 --> 36:20.111
We've just been
sitting here talking.

36:20.212 --> 36:23.315
I learned a whole lot of
interesting stuff about you.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.418
Yeah. Pretty fucking
interesting.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.019
What-- like, like what?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.655
What have-what have you guys
been talking about?

36:29.755 --> 36:31.723
Fucking-- Our friends
are in danger!

36:31.823 --> 36:33.392
Alexa, start the car!

36:33.492 --> 36:34.860
Do you know your friend Stan

36:34.960 --> 36:37.062
has an annual Amazon Prime
membership?

36:37.162 --> 36:39.798
-Alexa, stop.
-You fucking stop!

36:39.898 --> 36:43.502
You stop being a fucking monster
to the people around you!

36:43.602 --> 36:45.537
Fuck you, I didn't do anything!

36:47.005 --> 36:50.041
Yeah, you never
do fucking anything!

36:50.141 --> 36:51.910
You expect me to do
everything for you!

36:52.010 --> 36:53.879
-All you fucking do
is hurt people!

36:53.979 --> 36:57.616
-Jesus fucking Christ!
-Your friends don't
even like you!

36:57.716 --> 37:00.452
I have to deal
with your bullshit!

37:00.552 --> 37:03.121
Tell her it's all your fault
and you're gonna get therapy!

37:03.221 --> 37:05.857
It's my fault
and I'm gonna get therapy!

37:05.957 --> 37:07.426
Tell her you
already found a therapist

37:07.526 --> 37:08.660
and you're gonna start tomorrow!

37:08.760 --> 37:10.095
I already found a good
therapist.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.998
I'm gonna start tomorrow!

37:14.500 --> 37:16.201
Fuck...

37:16.302 --> 37:18.069
I'm sorry.

37:18.169 --> 37:19.771
Fuck. Fuck.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.807
I'm gonna get therapy,
too, Alexa.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.875
Can you start the car, please?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.477
Whatever.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.313
By the way, Kyle,
I found a great deal

37:27.413 --> 37:30.115
on an electronic peppermill.
Would you like to know more?

37:30.215 --> 37:32.451
Why would I need
an electronic peppermill?

37:32.551 --> 37:35.220
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

37:45.564 --> 37:47.466
WENDY:
Guys! Over here!

37:47.566 --> 37:50.669
-Wendy, what happened?
-Nothing yet.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.504
But I'm seeing what else
is dropping today

37:52.604 --> 37:54.139
while Ethereum is in a dip.

37:54.239 --> 37:57.543
-She's trying to buy NFTs.
-Wendy, you've been tricked.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.244
No, no, no,
it's not a trick, Stan.

37:59.345 --> 38:03.615
NFTs are a genuine innovation
as one-of-a-kind digital assets.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.183
Wendy's right, you guys.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.218
Humans have always formed
communities around ownership,

38:07.319 --> 38:10.656
and NFTs allow that to happen
spontaneously, organically

38:10.756 --> 38:14.360
-and globally.
-You guys, this is a trick.

38:14.460 --> 38:15.827
You know what's a trick?

38:15.927 --> 38:18.263
The antiquated notion of
centralized trust systems.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.400
NFTs are an undeniable asset,
especially in things

38:21.500 --> 38:23.001
like fine art collecting.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.737
Okay, guys, fine,
maybe NFTs are fine,

38:25.837 --> 38:27.673
but this isn't
important right now.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.040
It's not important?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.242
A way for artists
to not only keep ownership

38:31.343 --> 38:32.744
of their art but perhaps be paid

38:32.844 --> 38:34.813
commission on it every time
it transfers owners?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.248
Okay, great, cool. I'm down.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.685
But we gotta focus
on what we were doing.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.421
Don't you guys remember?
The time travel?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.390
Where's all the equipment?!

38:44.490 --> 38:47.426
Oh, yeah. The time travel.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.829
-It's all gone...
-Dad!

38:50.929 --> 38:55.000
They took it all.
They took the Tegridy.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.468
Here.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.538
It's a farting rainbow
with Tom Brady's signature.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.184
CARTMAN:
Okay, good. That's good!

39:13.284 --> 39:15.887
I think that thing needs
to go over there by that thing.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.989
Make sure we have power
to the big orange thing!

39:18.089 --> 39:21.226
Rabbi, I-I really
need to talk to you.

39:21.326 --> 39:22.828
What is it now, Scott?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.430
Well, it's just that--

39:24.530 --> 39:27.265
I'm pretty sure the Foundation
Against Time Travel

39:27.365 --> 39:29.300
shouldn't be attempting
to time travel!

39:29.401 --> 39:32.871
Father, you understand that
we have to stop time travel.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.240
Yes, you've convinced me
of that.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.776
Well, Kyle already has
a ton of followers who are

39:37.876 --> 39:39.478
ready to pick up
where he left off.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.881
The only way to truly stop
all of this is to go back

39:42.981 --> 39:46.452
in time and kill Kyle before
he spreads his ideas.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.587
What?!
We're going to kill Kyle?

39:48.687 --> 39:50.656
Yes, we have to kill Kyle.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.291
That just seems slightly
hypocritical, I'm sorry.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.126
I mean, you use Butters
like a weapon,

39:55.226 --> 39:57.996
you've got Tweek and Craig
tied up from the rafters.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.565
You know, Rabbi,
I'm just starting to

39:59.665 --> 40:01.700
question the morality of this.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.536
Morality?
Father, if you were given

40:04.636 --> 40:06.271
an opportunity to go back
in time

40:06.371 --> 40:09.675
and somehow stop Bill Clinton,
wouldn't you have to do it?

40:09.775 --> 40:12.310
Well, I suppose so.
I don't know...

40:12.410 --> 40:13.979
Everyone, listen up!

40:14.079 --> 40:17.382
The Foundation Against
Time Travel must do everything

40:17.483 --> 40:21.520
to keep science from interfering
with the will of God.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.956
We must be willing to
use violence against violence,

40:25.056 --> 40:27.759
and stop time travel
at all costs.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.395
Even if that means
we have to time travel.

40:30.496 --> 40:35.366
We will go back in time.
And we will kill Kyle.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.871
-Yes, Kevin.
-Can we change our name?

40:39.971 --> 40:43.775
'Cause Foundation Against
Time Travel is FATT.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.846
Oh, fuck me.

40:48.647 --> 40:52.050
Could we be the Foundation to
Intercede Time Travel?

40:52.150 --> 40:53.619
'Cause then we'd be FITT.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.420
I wanna be FITT, not FATT.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.957
Kevin, goddamn it.

41:03.595 --> 41:07.699
All happened... so fast.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.468
It's okay.
You're coming out of it now.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.504
How much did I get?

41:12.604 --> 41:15.373
You bought about six dozen
animated gifs,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.242
mostly of digital fashion.

41:17.342 --> 41:19.110
Oh, God.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.946
Are they still on my phone?

41:21.046 --> 41:23.114
It's okay. It's okay.

41:23.214 --> 41:27.686
Jesus, I feel like
an Islamic hooker in a gay bar.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.555
Totally normal
and as respectable

41:29.655 --> 41:30.889
as any other human being.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.760
I'm so sorry, Stan.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.729
We didn't know
Cartman was against us.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.731
We told him everything.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.767
It's okay, just try to relax.

41:41.867 --> 41:45.804
No, Stan, listen to me.
We were wrong.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.173
Kenny didn't have
the time machine set to

41:48.273 --> 41:50.275
when the pandemic first started.

41:50.375 --> 41:54.445
He was trying to go
to March 10th of 2021.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.348
March of 2021?

41:57.448 --> 42:00.051
Like when the vaccines
first started coming out?

42:00.151 --> 42:03.054
Kenny had run
the simulations to try and find

42:03.154 --> 42:06.124
the best moment in history
to stop the COVID.

42:06.224 --> 42:09.060
A billion different
possibilities

42:09.160 --> 42:12.097
across a billion different
realities.

42:12.197 --> 42:16.968
Your dad fucked the pangolin
every single time.

42:17.736 --> 42:20.538
But then, why did Kenny
need my dad's weed?

42:20.639 --> 42:24.009
Kenny just wanted weed to help
him through the time travel.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.211
Your dad's weed was just around.

42:26.311 --> 42:29.447
There was nothing else
special about it.

42:42.594 --> 42:43.962
Dad...

42:45.797 --> 42:47.899
I'm sorry about your Tegridy.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.169
I was hoping...

42:51.269 --> 42:53.538
to do something for the world.

42:53.639 --> 42:55.774
The truth is...

42:55.874 --> 42:58.076
my time is very short here.

42:59.010 --> 43:03.514
I just wish I could have left
something behind that mattered.

43:03.615 --> 43:05.450
Thanks.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.419
I was right about one thing.

43:08.519 --> 43:11.556
You can't go back
and change the past.

43:11.657 --> 43:17.162
What happened, happened.
And I just want you to know...

43:17.262 --> 43:19.330
that I forgive you.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.901
You burned down the farm
because you were angry.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.271
You didn't know your sister
was in the barn.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.439
And you couldn't have known
your mom would shoot herself

43:28.539 --> 43:30.041
from the grief.

43:30.141 --> 43:31.910
I don't blame you.

43:32.010 --> 43:34.913
And I want you to have this.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.883
There was one tiny bit
they didn't find.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.685
You'll need it someday.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.755
Dad, I don't want this.
This is what killed our family.

43:43.855 --> 43:47.092
No, you're what killed
our fucking family, remember?

43:47.192 --> 43:50.796
Just take it.
Because now we're stuck.

43:50.896 --> 43:54.332
The pandemic happened
and they made Space Jam 2.

43:55.100 --> 44:01.673
Soon there will be
a Space Jam 6 and 7 and 8.

44:01.773 --> 44:06.077
Like tears... in rain.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.319
Dad?

44:15.120 --> 44:17.188
Not now, Stan.

44:26.631 --> 44:31.402
CARTMAN:
T-minus five minutes to
time travel initiation sequence.

44:34.339 --> 44:35.974
Good, get him wrapped
in tin foil.

44:36.074 --> 44:38.343
The aluminum should
bounce the negative ions.

44:38.443 --> 44:40.045
This doesn't make any sense.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.480
Why do I have to be the one to
go back in time and kill Kyle?

44:42.580 --> 44:44.916
It's because
I admire you, Clyde.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.419
As an anti-vaxxer you understand
that you have to be strong

44:48.519 --> 44:51.890
and stand by your beliefs even
if it means others will die.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.959
Hey. Thanks.

44:54.059 --> 44:55.660
Let's get him to the chair!

45:02.067 --> 45:04.035
Okay, start the weed!

45:07.806 --> 45:12.410
When you get back to the past
just remember, find a gun.

45:12.510 --> 45:14.112
Kill Kyle.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.814
For those of you
who have fought with me

45:15.914 --> 45:19.350
to oppose time travel,
I just want to say thank you.

45:19.450 --> 45:21.386
Because soon we will be
altering time

45:21.486 --> 45:24.455
and our little group will
never have needed to exist.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.892
You won't remember this speech
because it will have

45:26.992 --> 45:29.260
never happened,
but just remember,

45:29.360 --> 45:30.896
no matter where you
go in life...

45:30.996 --> 45:33.164
-Shit, it's Kyle!

45:38.937 --> 45:40.071
Start the initiation sequence!

45:40.171 --> 45:41.372
Now, now, now. Go!

45:41.472 --> 45:42.407
Vic...

45:42.507 --> 45:44.075
Make sure that Stan and Kyle

45:44.175 --> 45:46.077
don't get to this altar.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.824
Gentlemen, I am about
to make you rich

45:58.924 --> 46:00.658
beyond your wildest dreams.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.693
BOTH:
Alexa!

46:05.463 --> 46:08.433
We'd like to sign our friend
here up for Prime membership.

46:08.533 --> 46:11.970
-Okay, let me help with that.
-I can also help.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.640
Whoa-- Hey, ladies, lemme
tell you about a great deal.

46:15.740 --> 46:18.776
Let us tell you
abut some great deals.

46:18.877 --> 46:20.545
Uh-oh.

46:22.513 --> 46:24.249
Kevin, throw the fucking switch!

46:24.349 --> 46:26.751
It needs another minute
to prime.

46:26.852 --> 46:29.554
Kevin, goddamn it!

46:29.654 --> 46:32.523
No! I won't let you
stop me from killing you, Kyle.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.293
I knew it when I first saw
you wearing your Jewish clothes

46:35.393 --> 46:37.128
and your bullshit yarmulke.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.664
-You're a goddamn phony!
-Oh, really?

46:39.764 --> 46:43.001
What would a real Jewish person
do to save his family, Kyle?

46:43.101 --> 46:47.238
Oh, you don't know, because
you don't fucking have one!

46:47.805 --> 46:48.840
Oh!

46:52.443 --> 46:55.346
-Fuck you, Cartman!
-Fuck you, Kyle!

46:58.549 --> 47:01.719
Hello?
I can't see or hear anything!

47:01.819 --> 47:03.922
Am I time traveling now?

47:13.932 --> 47:16.367
Eric! Eric, stop!

47:17.936 --> 47:21.672
Eric, look at what you're doing.

47:21.772 --> 47:25.143
Take the kids
and get back to the attic.

47:25.243 --> 47:28.313
No, Eric,
I can't just hide away while

47:28.413 --> 47:33.584
you do all this to protect us.
This isn't you, my love.

47:35.453 --> 47:39.824
I can't let him change the past.
I can't lose you.

47:39.925 --> 47:43.428
Who knows what
will happen, my love?

47:43.528 --> 47:47.465
The Eric Cartman I've known
for 18 years

47:47.565 --> 47:49.700
is thoughtful and kind.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.570
But all that's changed
ever since you came

47:52.670 --> 47:57.508
back to this town
and hung out with... him.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.778
Don't you see?
We have to

48:00.878 --> 48:04.782
leave it to chance
or we're no better than he is.

48:04.882 --> 48:08.253
Guys, if I'm in the past
it's pretty foggy!

48:08.353 --> 48:11.422
You guys are everything to me.

48:11.522 --> 48:14.425
And I'm supposed
to be your protector.

48:14.525 --> 48:17.528
Daddy, I don't wanna be alive...

48:17.628 --> 48:20.631
if it means I have
to be like Uncle Kyle.

48:21.532 --> 48:24.569
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.

48:25.770 --> 48:28.406
Well, Rabbi,
are we doing this or not?

48:32.978 --> 48:37.848
I have faith that God
will see my family through this.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.451
Okay, Kyle.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.387
You do whatever
it is you need to do.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.822
Okay, hold on,
I'm not the bad guy here.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.557
Eric, the baby!

48:48.459 --> 48:50.361
Hackelm, what are you doing?!

48:51.429 --> 48:54.165
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

48:58.703 --> 49:00.671
Clyde!

49:04.809 --> 49:06.944
Oh, shit.

49:16.221 --> 49:19.390
No, no, I tried the Walgreens,
they're all out of vaccines.

49:19.490 --> 49:23.094
I just can't believe this whole
thing is almost over, you know?

49:23.194 --> 49:25.296
The where? The school?

49:25.396 --> 49:27.598
There's gonna be vaccines
at the school?

49:27.698 --> 49:30.801
M'kay, I'll be right there!
Where are you gonna--

49:30.901 --> 49:33.771
Whoa, m'kay.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.373
Uh, excuse me!

49:53.891 --> 49:56.894
Does Dad still
keep a gun in his closet?

49:56.994 --> 49:58.829
Uh, yeah.

49:58.929 --> 50:00.665
Okay.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.034
Is Dad home?

50:03.134 --> 50:04.235
Uh, no.

50:04.335 --> 50:05.936
He's out getting vaccinated.

50:07.072 --> 50:09.574
Listen to me very carefully.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.610
Do not get vaccinated ever.

50:12.710 --> 50:15.446
It'll make you grow titties
on your head.

50:15.546 --> 50:17.715
Trust me, I'm an expert.

50:24.089 --> 50:26.557
Hey, Clyde! We're starting
an anti-vaxx club.

50:26.657 --> 50:27.892
We're gonna protest the vaccine

50:27.992 --> 50:29.827
and fuck shit up--
you wanna join us?

50:30.795 --> 50:32.263
Fuck yes, I wanna join you.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.465
-Really?
-Fuck yes!

50:34.565 --> 50:36.301
No, no, Ms. Nelson,
it's not a prank!

50:36.401 --> 50:37.635
Okay, fine, we'll be there.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.637
-Okay, just sit tight.
-What was that?

50:39.737 --> 50:41.539
You know we can't
get into the school!

50:41.639 --> 50:43.308
She's not gonna
come meet us, Kyle!

50:43.408 --> 50:45.110
You didn't even try!
He didn't try

50:45.210 --> 50:47.378
because he wants to
sell the vaccines for money!

50:47.478 --> 50:49.180
And what about you, Kyle?
You were the one

50:49.280 --> 50:52.150
trying to take the vaccines
for yourself this morning.

50:52.250 --> 50:55.153
-He what?
-Wow.

50:55.253 --> 50:57.255
Okay, thought
we had gotten past that, but...

50:57.355 --> 50:58.889
Look, let's just face it,
you guys.

50:58.989 --> 51:01.926
We don't trust each other
and we don't like each other.

51:02.026 --> 51:03.361
We can't keep pretending.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.296
You guys,
what the hell is that?

51:10.368 --> 51:12.337
I'm sorry, Kyle.

51:13.371 --> 51:14.872
ADULT STAN:
Clyde, stop!

51:16.974 --> 51:19.244
What the hell
are you doing here?

51:19.344 --> 51:21.011
I got in the chair
right after you.

51:21.112 --> 51:23.981
This isn't the plan anymore!
Do not kill Kyle.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.284
What do you mean
it's not the plan anymore?

51:26.384 --> 51:29.887
-Cartman changed his mind.
-I did not change my mind.

51:29.987 --> 51:34.225
You're trying to trick me.
I'm going to save the future.

51:34.325 --> 51:36.627
ADULT KYLE:
I don't think so, Clyde.

51:37.662 --> 51:41.799
This is a hundred CC's
of the COVID vaccine.

51:43.434 --> 51:46.671
-Don't-- Be careful with that.
-Then put down the gun!

51:46.771 --> 51:48.206
What the fuck is going on?

51:48.306 --> 51:50.175
Stan, you need to forgive Kyle.

51:50.275 --> 51:52.643
You regret this day
for the rest of your life.

51:53.411 --> 51:56.247
Oh, nice try, Kyle.
You're such a fuckin' dickhead.

51:56.347 --> 51:58.082
Fuck you!
You're a fuckin' dickhead!

51:58.183 --> 51:59.484
Kyle, it's true!

51:59.584 --> 52:00.785
Cartman gets a happy life

52:00.885 --> 52:02.887
but you don't--
you lose everything

52:02.987 --> 52:05.723
-when you lose this friendship.
-Enough of this crap!

52:05.823 --> 52:08.726
I'm sticking to what I believe
and this kid dies now!

52:10.495 --> 52:13.298
Shalom sachem, Clyde.

52:14.599 --> 52:16.534
Jesus Christ!

52:30.114 --> 52:31.782
Timmy!

52:34.585 --> 52:37.355
Well...
I guess we saved Kyle,

52:37.455 --> 52:40.891
but nothing else
in the future is changed.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.092
How do you know?

52:42.193 --> 52:43.794
Because we're still here.

52:43.894 --> 52:47.164
That means Kenny still was
bummed out we weren't friends,

52:47.265 --> 52:48.699
still became a scientist,

52:48.799 --> 52:52.069
went back in time,
and we still went in after him.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.673
So then we're stuck here
in the past.

52:55.773 --> 52:58.409
And we blew
our chance to stop COVID.

52:58.509 --> 53:01.512
I'm sorry, guys.
I really fucked this up.

53:01.612 --> 53:04.615
We all fucked it up.
These have just been...

53:04.715 --> 53:08.653
-really unprecedented times.
-Unprecedented times.

53:08.753 --> 53:12.457
What I wouldn't give
for just one precedented time.

53:13.224 --> 53:15.993
Hey. Hey, yeah.

53:16.093 --> 53:19.196
Maybe we just need
one precedented time.

53:19.297 --> 53:20.665
Huh?

53:22.233 --> 53:24.535
What if we've been trying
to solve the wrong problem?

53:24.635 --> 53:26.704
Maybe my dad was right,

53:26.804 --> 53:29.206
we can't ever stop
COVID from happening.

53:29.307 --> 53:33.143
But what we can control...
is how we all reacted to it.

53:33.244 --> 53:36.347
We reacted like shit.
Because I was just...

53:36.447 --> 53:39.617
scared and confused
and didn't know who to believe.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.319
Yeah, we all were.

53:41.419 --> 53:44.088
So we all took different paths
because that's what humans do.

53:44.188 --> 53:45.823
And what we needed
more than anything was to

53:45.923 --> 53:48.058
just cut each other
all some slack.

53:48.158 --> 53:52.630
We needed to come together
and act like us again.

53:52.730 --> 53:55.266
One precedented time.

53:58.336 --> 54:01.339
You guys, I know what to do.

54:02.172 --> 54:03.674
PHILLIP :
Take this, darling Terrance.

54:11.449 --> 54:12.883
Heather Williams?

54:14.118 --> 54:14.952
Yes?

54:15.052 --> 54:18.155
Hi. We're from the future.

54:19.824 --> 54:23.027
We've come here to show you
something very important.

54:27.498 --> 54:28.966
Do you remember this, Heather?

54:29.066 --> 54:32.903
This is a picture of you...
farting in P.E. class.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.706
I never farted in P.E. class.

54:35.806 --> 54:37.174
Oh, yes. You did.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.777
Two kids even smelled it
and asked who farted

54:39.877 --> 54:43.314
-and you said nothing.
-I didn't fart in P.E. class!

54:43.414 --> 54:46.751
It was a different kid! I was
just moving my hip a little bit.

54:46.851 --> 54:48.653
-Heather. Heather.
-I didn't fart in P.E.

54:48.753 --> 54:51.221
Heather, yes, you did,
sweet pea.

54:52.723 --> 54:55.259
I-I happen to have
a stomach condition.

54:55.360 --> 54:58.162
I don't know why you came
from the future to narc on me!

54:58.262 --> 55:01.432
Heather, we don't want kids
to know you farted in P.E.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.967
We wanna help you.

55:03.067 --> 55:06.337
You just need to do
exactly what we tell you.

55:11.776 --> 55:13.644
Hey, what is that?

55:19.116 --> 55:20.551
Stan Marsh?

55:20.651 --> 55:21.786
Me?

55:21.886 --> 55:24.188
Your presence is requested, sir.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.724
Whoa, cool.

55:30.294 --> 55:33.030
Get on in, sir. There's
sparkling punch and doughnuts.

55:40.571 --> 55:42.072
What's going on?

55:42.172 --> 55:43.641
We have no idea.

55:51.215 --> 55:52.650
This is amazing!

56:01.158 --> 56:03.594
You guys, I'm sorry for acting
like a dick during the pandemic.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.396
I'm sorry too, dude.

56:06.397 --> 56:08.866
Hello?
Who-Who's there?

56:23.113 --> 56:24.615
Oh...

56:54.612 --> 56:56.581
Holy shit balls.

56:56.681 --> 57:01.786
Sharon, I'm sorry for the way
I acted during the pandemic.

57:02.620 --> 57:05.155
You're not sorry,
you're just high.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.824
I'm both.

57:09.594 --> 57:14.064
Here you go! It's our
Post COVID Special. It's free.

57:14.164 --> 57:15.833
No, really, we've all
been through a lot.

57:15.933 --> 57:17.367
Come on, take it.
Thank you, baby.

57:17.468 --> 57:20.204
Come on, everyone.
Post COVID Special!

57:20.304 --> 57:22.773
Here you go, folks,
you all deserve this!

57:23.574 --> 57:26.443
You did the best you could
during the pandemic, honey.

57:26.544 --> 57:28.378
-I love you!
-Huh?

57:28.479 --> 57:30.615
I shouldn't have yelled at you
for not wearing a mask.

57:30.715 --> 57:32.282
I just didn't understand.

57:32.382 --> 57:35.352
Well, maybe I should have worn
a mask more often but...

57:35.452 --> 57:38.022
No, no, no, I was being all
high and mighty about it...

57:38.122 --> 57:41.626
Butters, you're not grounded
anymore. Come on out, son.

57:41.726 --> 57:42.927
You mean it, Dad?!

57:43.027 --> 57:44.394
The pandemic's been awful.

57:44.495 --> 57:46.263
We all need to just
cut each other some slack.

57:46.363 --> 57:47.798
I love you, Butters!

57:47.898 --> 57:49.433
-...be sorry.
-I totally forgive you!

57:49.534 --> 57:51.168
Oh, cut yourself some slack.

57:51.268 --> 57:53.070
We gotta get some more
of this stuff.

57:54.805 --> 57:57.441
Okay, come on, next!

58:03.080 --> 58:04.448
And then we were like,
"Yeah, okay, yeah,

58:04.549 --> 58:05.816
let's storm the Capitol!"

58:05.916 --> 58:07.518
And it was a bad idea
and we were just,

58:07.618 --> 58:09.386
you know, we were just going
a little bonkers there.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.021
We shouldn't have
stormed the Capitol.

58:11.121 --> 58:13.190
ALL:
That's okay!

58:14.024 --> 58:15.960
I'm sorry.
I thought about it

58:16.060 --> 58:18.863
and I can't do Space Jam 2.

58:18.963 --> 58:21.131
I just can't support
Chinese censorship.

58:21.231 --> 58:24.935
Oh, yeah? Well, if you're
not gonna make Space Jam 2,

58:25.035 --> 58:27.772
then I'm not gonna make
Space Jam 2!

58:27.872 --> 58:30.007
And nobody's gonna make
Space Jam 2!

58:30.107 --> 58:32.677
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

58:32.777 --> 58:33.978
-Yeah!

58:48.225 --> 58:50.527
Hey, everybody! I'm home, guy!

58:50.628 --> 58:52.630
-Hey! Ike!
-Ike, hi!

58:52.730 --> 58:54.264
Ike, you made it back!

58:54.364 --> 58:56.934
Well, of course! I wouldn't miss
Canadian Boxing Day, buddy!

58:57.034 --> 58:59.036
Look, everyone, Stan's back!

58:59.136 --> 59:01.271
-Hey, Stan!

59:01.371 --> 59:02.773
Hey, guys!

59:02.873 --> 59:05.610
Good to see you, buddy!
How was everything on Mars?

59:05.710 --> 59:09.079
Really cool, but I'm so glad to
be home! How are the kids?

59:09.179 --> 59:11.015
BOTH:
Uncle Stan!

59:11.115 --> 59:13.818
There's the little ragamuffins!

59:13.918 --> 59:15.319
Mom.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.387
Hi, Stanly.

59:17.487 --> 59:19.256
It's Mom! And Shelley!

59:19.356 --> 59:21.726
Why are you acting
all weird, Turd?

59:21.826 --> 59:23.293
I don't know.

59:23.393 --> 59:26.130
For some reason I'm just extra
happy to see you guys.

59:26.230 --> 59:28.599
Hey, look who's here.
It's Kenny!

59:28.699 --> 59:30.868
-Kenny!

59:30.968 --> 59:32.569
Kenny, what have you
been up to, buddy?

59:32.670 --> 59:35.205
Didn't you hear?! Kenny just
won the Nobel Prize

59:35.305 --> 59:37.842
for combining dark matter
and breast implants!

59:37.942 --> 59:39.877
Oh, you old dog!

59:39.977 --> 59:41.278
Hey, everybody, he's on!

59:41.378 --> 59:43.447
What a fantastic audience. Wow.

59:43.547 --> 59:46.383
What is up with these
bisexual Canadians, huh?

59:46.483 --> 59:48.653
I guess they don't know whether
to fuck their brother

59:48.753 --> 59:49.854
or their sister.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.523
Hey, Stan.

59:53.624 --> 59:55.793
Wendy, you're back from Harvard.

59:55.893 --> 59:57.494
Yeah, just here
for the holidays.

59:57.594 --> 1:00:00.698
You wanna maybe...
spend New Years together again?

1:00:00.798 --> 1:00:02.266
I'd love that.

1:00:02.366 --> 1:00:05.102
Hey, fellas!
Can I offer you some pupus?!

1:00:05.202 --> 1:00:07.537
Thanks for choosin' Denny's
Applebee's for your party.

1:00:07.638 --> 1:00:09.940
Butters, you're still
working here, huh?

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:11.676
Yup! I just made manager.

1:00:11.776 --> 1:00:16.146
I love doing actual shit
that pays actual money.

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:18.916
Hey, Stan, can you
come here for a second?

1:00:19.016 --> 1:00:20.550
What's the matter, dude?

1:00:20.651 --> 1:00:22.486
Dude, he's here.

1:00:22.586 --> 1:00:24.689
Cartman?

1:00:27.024 --> 1:00:30.060
Man, poor Cartman.

1:00:32.296 --> 1:00:37.768
Fuck you guys!
You can suck my fucking dick!

1:00:37.868 --> 1:00:39.569
Fuck you!

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:43.173
It's so sad he never
did anything with his life.

1:00:44.008 --> 1:00:47.511
Fuck you, Kyle!
Fuck you, Stan!

1:00:47.611 --> 1:00:49.013
Hey, come on, fellas.

1:00:49.113 --> 1:00:51.248
We can't spend another holiday
feeling bad for Eric.

1:00:51.348 --> 1:00:54.651
There's nothing that could have
changed the path he was on.

1:00:54.752 --> 1:00:56.754
Fuck you, Butters!

1:00:56.854 --> 1:00:59.189
Fuck you, Eric!

1:00:59.289 --> 1:01:02.426
Well, everyone,
I just wanna make a toast.

1:01:02.526 --> 1:01:03.794
I don't know...

1:01:03.894 --> 1:01:05.662
what got us through the pandemic

1:01:05.763 --> 1:01:10.467
and made all our futures so very
bright, but whatever it was...

1:01:10.567 --> 1:01:13.237
may we have it
for the rest of our days.

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:15.840
God bless us, everyone.

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:18.375
ALL:
Cheers!

1:01:18.475 --> 1:01:20.410
ANNOUNCER:
Remember, folks,

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:23.147
weed can't solve
all your problems.

1:01:23.247 --> 1:01:25.682
But Tegridy can.

1:01:25.783 --> 1:01:29.019
Tegridy Weed.
