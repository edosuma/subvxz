01:53.863 --> 01:55.030
Mommy.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.117
Mommy, can we play croquet today?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.459
Where's Daddy?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.336
He's running.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.798
From what?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.145
Eat.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.151
Oh, shit.
All right.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.570
How was your run?
Good. It was good.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.114
Eat your breakfast.
I don't like it.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.700
You do too. Stop coloring.
I'm impressed you're keeping it up.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.702
What brand is this?
They're the same.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.329
Daddy, look, it's your team.
Hmm?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.584
Hey. That's my team.
That's great, honey. Are they winning?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.627
Yeah.
That's more like it. Oh, oh.

02:52.839 --> 02:57.050
Sweetheart, do not use words like that.
That's a bad word. Okay?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.344
Okay.
Yes, that is a bad word.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.846
Yes, it is.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.432
What? Don't look at me.
Mm-hm. Okay.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.726
Goodbye, sweetie. Goodbye, jellybean.
Oh...

03:05.894 --> 03:07.352
Bye, Daddy.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.565
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Why?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.483
Just checking.

03:14.485 --> 03:18.655
Okay. Bye, guys.
Bye.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.116
Can I have more juice?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.126
Mike! Did you call Fenn about the tree?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.213
No. I will today.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.799
Please do. I don't want it coming down
on the house.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.137
Yeah, you're right. I will.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.347
Love you.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.099
I love you too, sweetie. Bye.
Bye.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.288
I'm down here.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.462
What's up, Vig?

04:57.797 --> 05:01.091
Donna's out sick. I can't find
anything without her. This sucks.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.802
Who was that guy?
Oh. That sucks more.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.307
That's the plumber. I called him
to look at this piece-of-crap boiler.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.516
Why?

05:09.684 --> 05:12.978
Because it clanks and it's
driving me crazy. You don't hear this?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.564
I hear it. I just figured that it's old, so...

05:15.773 --> 05:18.734
He said we have to replace it
because it's gonna blow.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.570
What? We just had it fixed
like three months ago.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.114
He said that job was crap.
That guy did crap work.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.283
Can you believe that? That little scumbag.
Heh.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.285
Unbelievable.
Um...

05:28.494 --> 05:31.246
How much to fix it? Did he say?
Ah, 6 grand.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.873
Holy shit!
That's right.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.708
Holy shit!
Tell me about it.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.002
And I gotta tell you, I'm not doing great.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.006
My business is off,
and my stepson wants to get the Lasik.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.177
Really? Isn't he kind of young for that?
You know, I really don't care.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.222
If he wants to get Lasik and it
makes him happy, then he can have it.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.850
Okay, so, uh...

05:52.769 --> 05:54.186
...what you want to do here?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.854
Okay. I was thinking...

05:56.522 --> 05:58.899
...let's just leave it for now. We just...

05:59.567 --> 06:01.610
...put plastic on the files.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.738
What you thinking?
That sounds great. That's good.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.281
For now.
Yeah, fine.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.243
Let's get out of here
before this thing blows.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.954
I'll get some plastic
before practice.

06:15.583 --> 06:20.420
Good morning, Shelly. How you doing?
A little hungover. My boyfriend's a moron.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.005
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.341
How'd the team do last night?
We lost.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.884
Bummer.

06:26.052 --> 06:30.055
Your noon canceled,
so you just have the 10:30 and the 3:00.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.306
Anything else?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.558
The toilet's not flushing again.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.394
Should I call someone this time?

06:35.561 --> 06:38.563
No, I'll take a look at it.
Who have I got at 10:30?

06:39.190 --> 06:40.565
Frank.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.820
You think your son stole it?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.822
Yeah, I know he did.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.659
Why would he steal your cat?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.995
He's jealous of her. Very jealous.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.126
I can see why.
It's a nice-looking cat.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.919
Oh, yeah.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.472
What's Vig doing with that plastic?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.271
Who knows?

07:23.443 --> 07:27.696
Leo, remember you got lost
and the police had to help you a few times.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.699
That's why we got Jolie to help you.
Right?

07:31.325 --> 07:32.784
So, what do we do now?

07:32.952 --> 07:37.372
If that judge deems you incapacitated,
you'll need a guardian.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.834
If we can't find your daughter-
She can't even find herself.

07:41.002 --> 07:45.046
Okay. If we can't find her, then the state
will become your guardian.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.506
What state?

07:48.342 --> 07:52.262
You know, the state...of New Jersey.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.058
That's crazy.
I don't need New Jersey's help.

07:57.226 --> 08:02.939
I got Jolie. And there's nothing
going on between us, so you know.

08:03.107 --> 08:06.485
Okay. I'm sure that there's not. Uh...

08:07.570 --> 08:12.407
Let's first try to find your daughter,
and then we'll go from there, okay?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.246
Am I still hungover
or is that noise getting louder?

08:18.414 --> 08:20.665
You're probably still hungover, Shelly.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.420
We got copies of Leo's financial
statements. The guy's loaded.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.006
Leo? Yeah.
Any luck finding his daughter?

08:28.341 --> 08:31.218
No, that lady is gone.
I have tried everything.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.677
Crap.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.763
Let me see his file again.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.225
Can't the state just leave him in his home?
That's what he wants.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.436
Yeah, they could. But they won't.
It's too much work.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.439
They'll move him into Oak Knoll.
Pass me a brochure.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.816
But he's got Jolie. She can handle it.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.195
No, she can't. The guardian
has to make all the decisions.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.864
It's the difference
between a babysitter and a parent.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.117
Well, that's a bummer.
I wish I could do it.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.954
I could use the extra 1500 a month.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.623
Fifteen hundred dollars?
Is that the commission?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.626
It's in the file. I told you, he's loaded.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.086
Mike Flaherty's office.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.547
Move! Move! Stay right on him.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.549
Don't cross your feet!

09:11.050 --> 09:14.302
Stay on him!
Keep your chest right down on him!

09:14.470 --> 09:16.304
Runaway
When I say

09:16.472 --> 09:17.556
Other man!

09:17.723 --> 09:20.767
Come on, let's go!
Move, don't cross your feet!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.936
Hey, hey, hey.
Whose headgear is this?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.897
Whose headgear? Stemler, wake up!

09:28.442 --> 09:31.403
How's the team doing?
Not good.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.241
What the hell happened, man?
We used to be good.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.076
Not anymore.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.162
Shit. Could we stop for a second?
Yeah.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.041
Holy shit. That sucked.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.421
You're running good, buddy.
You're kicking my ass.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.048
I'm trying to get out here
a bit more often, you know?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.341
You gotta be kidding me.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.844
What?
Lori. Texting me at 7 in the morning...

09:56.012 --> 09:59.055
...asking if I want an antique
sewing table we bought together.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.933
Do you?
No! I want my fucking house back!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.603
Is she still with that guy?
What, my contractor?

10:04.895 --> 10:05.937
Guy I hired? Yeah.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.648
Scumbag's probably walking around
my house wearing his tool belt.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.692
Ha, ha.
Take a picture.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.030
For chrissake.
Come on, take it.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.781
Come on, it's cold!

10:21.287 --> 10:24.372
Don't send it.
Too late. I hate her.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.627
Maybe you should move back to the city.
Get a new job. Shake things up a little bit.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.547
Finley called. He's starting
a fund in May. I'll wait for that.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.342
That guy is starting
another fund already? Wow.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.968
The guy's an animal. He prints money.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.553
Heh, heh.
Come on.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.513
Let's finish strong, all right?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.497
Hold up!

11:05.665 --> 11:06.748
What?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.543
What's wrong?
Just hold up.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.838
Hold up.
You okay?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.675
I can't breathe.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.593
You're breathing funny.

11:20.429 --> 11:24.432
Mike. Holy shit. Mike, you okay?
I'm gonna call somebody.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.727
Don't call, don't call. I'm fine.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.943
Okay, Mike...

11:35.111 --> 11:38.196
Is it your heart?
Buddy, are you having a heart attack?

11:38.572 --> 11:42.075
No, I'm not having a heart attack.
I just can't breathe.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.453
Okay. You could be having a heart attack.
Let's lay down.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.414
It's wet. I don't wanna lay down.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.416
You're dying. Lay down. Come on.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.377
Do me a favor and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.295
Why?
Just squeeze it.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.798
Are you cold?
Yeah, I'm lying on the ground.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.467
Okay. All right. I'm gonna blanket you.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.304
I'm gonna warm you up.
I'm gonna warm you up. It's okay.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.392
Are you all right?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.065
Sorry!

12:17.445 --> 12:19.112
How long has that been happening?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.656
Couple of months.
Doctor says it's stress.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.617
He prescribe anything for you?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.912
Yeah, jogging.
What do you think I'm doing out here?

12:28.080 --> 12:31.332
That scared the shit out of me.
What are you stressed about?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.795
I don't know.
Just work, money, everything.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.465
Is it that bad?
Yeah, it is.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.966
It is.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.511
I don't know if I can
keep my practice going.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.348
Really? Holy shit, Mike.
Yeah.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.101
I've tried everything.
I have no idea what to do, Terry.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.438
You told Jackie?
No. Not yet. I don't want to freak her out.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.440
Good call. All right.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.276
We just have to come up
with a new strategy, right?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.280
What else can you do for money?

13:02.615 --> 13:06.367
What am I gonna do, bartend?
I'm a lawyer, Terry. I practice the law.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.535
I know.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.790
I'm not some fricking scumbag.
I help out old people for chrissake.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.795
No offense, but your pal Finley,
all he gives a crap about is making money.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.130
Yeah, but that's why he makes it.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.716
No shit, Terry. Thanks for the update.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.009
I'm just wrapping up.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.221
Sharon called. She wants-

13:26.388 --> 13:28.848
Jack, I gotta take this other call. Okay?
Mm-hm.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.892
All right. Bye.
All right. Bye.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.187
Hey, Tom.
Hey, Mike.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.439
How are you?
Good, good, thanks.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.942
Thanks for getting back to me.
How you doing?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.069
I'm good. I'm very good. Ha, ha.
Good, good.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.654
So, what's up?
Um...

13:42.822 --> 13:46.825
Listen. I was just following up
to see if you had any overflow.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.785
It's been a slow month on this end.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.330
Yeah, look, I gotta be honest.
It's been a slow month on this end too.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.418
We really don't have overflow at this point.
Sorry about that.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.504
Right. Yeah, okay.
I wish I could help.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.840
No, I got it.
It's been slow here too.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.093
I appreciate that. Yeah.
Okay, good. If you need to reach out...

14:28.784 --> 14:29.826
Stop. Hold on.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.619
Leo. Hold on a sec, Leo.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.163
Go back through.
Somebody stop that gentleman, please.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.041
Any word from his daughter?

14:37.209 --> 14:41.713
No, Your Honor. We have the two
certified letters returned unclaimed.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.382
There is no phone number for her.
We can't find her.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.385
She is the only living family, correct?

14:47.553 --> 14:51.306
Correct, but Mr. Poplar
has not seen her for over 20 years.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.600
Who?
Your daughter.

14:53.767 --> 14:58.313
Oh. She's late. Probably shopping
for some crap or something.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.647
Okay.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.733
Thank you, Mr. Flaherty.

15:02.109 --> 15:05.987
Okay, as Mr. Poplar has been deemed
incapacitated by this court...

15:06.155 --> 15:09.449
... I'm appointing the Office of
Public Guardian to serve as guardian...

15:09.617 --> 15:11.242
...for his person and property.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.328
Do you have the order for me to sign?

15:13.746 --> 15:17.457
Yes, I sure do, Your Honor.
Then please approach.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.671
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

15:23.839 --> 15:26.799
Yes, Mr. Flaherty? What is it?

15:27.343 --> 15:30.261
I would be willing to serve
as Mr. Poplar's guardian.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.139
Really?
Yes.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.767
You've known him how long?
Two weeks?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.769
More like five.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.772
Really?
And you want to be his guardian now?

15:41.315 --> 15:44.734
May I approach, Your Honor?
Counsel, approach.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.695
What's going on, Mike?

15:47.863 --> 15:51.824
Judge, I feel I would be a better candidate
than the state in this particular case.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.953
Really?
Yes. Stop saying, "Really." It's annoying.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.121
I live in the same town as Mr. Poplar.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.582
Proximity hardly qualifies him
as a guardian.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.459
And as his lawyer...

16:01.627 --> 16:05.546
... I am in a better position
to execute exactly what my client wants.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.883
Mr. Flaherty
is Mr. Poplar's court-appointed attorney.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.302
I know, Stu. I appointed him.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.389
Well, that hardly qualifies him
as a guardian.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.684
I mean, why should we go along with this?
Mike?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.313
Judge, Leo has told me
that he wants to live at home.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.985
He has the money to do that. I wanna make
sure that happens. If the state can do that-

16:27.361 --> 16:28.903
Counsel knows we can't do that.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.990
We're spread too thin
to give that kind of individual attention.

16:32.157 --> 16:36.995
But there is an excellent elder-care facility
in Mr. Poplar's town. We'll put him there.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.247
Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.249
You can do that, Mike?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.585
Yes, I can. Really.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.215
Did we win?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.760
Yeah, I think we did.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.679
Good.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.078
Are we going to the park?

17:19.246 --> 17:24.208
No. I'm gonna help you settle into a new
place so you can live right here in town.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.878
I don't need a new place. I have a house.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.548
I don't need that fancy stuff.
I know.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.553
I just need you to live in this place
for a little while. It's very nice. You'll like it.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.638
Did the judge say that?

17:38.807 --> 17:40.475
Yes, the judge said so.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.904
Okay?

18:37.366 --> 18:42.537
Still all my song shall be

18:42.704 --> 18:53.131
Nearer, my God, to thee

18:53.715 --> 18:55.508
Have a great day, gentlemen. Okay?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.718
All right. Come on, crazy-legs.

18:59.179 --> 19:02.348
Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.559
We have to get bagels for your mom.
Okay.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.769
I have to make one stop first.
Where?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.063
I gotta shut the water off
at a client's house.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.356
Why?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.025
It's freezing out.
I don't want his pipes to burst.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.444
No, I mean why are you doing it?

19:15.612 --> 19:17.864
Uh... Oh. Because I'm his guardian.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.908
What? Since when?
Since last week.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.536
That's a big deal.
Were you even gonna tell me?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.746
It's not a big deal. I was gonna tell you.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.207
You don't have time
to take care of an old man.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.585
He's at Oak Knoll.
They take care of everything.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.045
I just have to check in on him
from time to time.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.338
Well, who pays for that?

19:34.506 --> 19:40.428
He does. Come on, kiddo. It comes out
of his estate. And he can afford it, trust me.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.889
I don't get it.
You've never done it before.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.516
No, I haven't.
So why are you doing it now?

19:45.684 --> 19:49.979
Because it's the right thing to do, all right?
We couldn't find his daughter...

19:50.147 --> 19:53.024
...and I just wanna help the guy out.
It's not a big deal.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.402
It sounds like a big deal.
You should have told me.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.653
What's a big deal?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.072
Is this gonna take long?

20:00.407 --> 20:01.866
Nope. It'll be two minutes.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.161
Who's that?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.954
No idea.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.209
Who is that, Mommy?
I don't know, honey.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.627
Daddy's gonna find out.

20:19.968 --> 20:23.471
How you doing? Can I help you?
No.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.307
You looking for Mr. Poplar?

20:26.808 --> 20:27.975
Yeah.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.479
He doesn't live here anymore.
Where does he live?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.649
Mind telling me
why you're looking for him first?

20:36.526 --> 20:39.445
He's my grandfather.
I came to live with him.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.832
You live around here, Kyle?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.001
No. Ohio.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.671
Ohio? Where are your parents?

20:57.422 --> 21:00.508
It's just me and my mom. She's back
in Columbus. She couldn't come.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.636
How did you get here?
Bus.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.390
Really? All by yourself?
Yeah.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.976
That sounds like a big deal.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.483
Leo, how you doing?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.151
You have a visitor.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.321
Who? Him?
Yeah.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.785
Come on in. I'll turn off the TV.

21:30.330 --> 21:34.542
Let's just kick it around,
as they say, man to man.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.713
This is Kyle Timmons, Leo.
He's your grandson.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.506
Came from Ohio to see you.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.008
I don't have a grandson.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.136
Yeah, you do. We just never met.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.221
You gonna bring me home?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.974
No, he's just here for a visit.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.689
Okay. You want to watch a little TV?

21:57.065 --> 21:58.566
Yeah. Sure.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.944
Well, I'm very good at keeping secrets.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.780
There's some things
I won't even tell myself.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.074
What is it, son?
You're looking at it.

22:07.242 --> 22:11.037
So I'll pick you up in about an hour.
Okay.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.415
- like everybody does, Father,
only you're too polite to say anything.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.710
So you called his mother?
No, not yet.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.547
Oh. He was smoking too. He's 16.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.801
Well, he's probably on drugs.
What are you gonna do with him?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.596
We're gonna send him back,
is what we'll do.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.183
I certainly hope so.
You got your hands full over there.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.728
Now taking care of that old man too?
Sounds like too much, Mike.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.773
It is too much. And somehow
he forgot to tell me all about it.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.609
I told you.
No, not until I asked.

22:41.777 --> 22:45.654
His daughter should be taking care of him,
not you. You got me to worry about.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.783
I don't have to worry about him.
He's at Oak Knoll.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.203
Can we play croquet today?
The whole thing sounds crazy.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.080
It is crazy. It's crazy.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.623
Who's crazy?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.667
Me.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.756
So he lives here now?
Uh-huh.

23:03.924 --> 23:09.220
Your grandfather's in the early stages
of dementia, Kyle, so he needs a little help.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.222
Are you a friend of his
or something?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.808
Uh, I'm his guardian.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.476
What does that mean?

23:15.644 --> 23:18.062
I make sure that he's well taken care of.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.106
That's cool.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.829
Everything all right?
Yeah.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.875
Did you reach your mom?
Yeah. I told her I was coming home.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.545
Did she wanna talk to me or anything?

23:42.879 --> 23:44.171
No.

23:44.339 --> 23:47.049
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you can't stay longer.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.261
But maybe you can come back
again and visit with your mom.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.098
Yeah, maybe.
If I wanna smoke, should I go outside?

23:54.724 --> 23:56.183
You shouldn't be smoking.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.185
I know. But if I do.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.275
Then you should go outside.
All right. Good night, Jackie.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.028
Good night, Kyle.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.581
What are you doing?

24:18.748 --> 24:22.209
We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking
any chances with Eminem down there.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.879
There's not even a bathroom down there.

24:37.809 --> 24:41.729
Can you get these people to get me some
Cocoa Puffs? I really like them.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.980
You got it.

24:45.150 --> 24:49.862
That Mike is a standup guy.
You need cereal, go see him.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.781
Okay. We should go, Kyle.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.075
Okay. Bye, Leo.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.204
You going to work?
No, I'm going home.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.414
Don't take any shit
from any of those guys.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.042
I won't.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.505
Here's 50 bucks, in case you need it.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.215
I have money.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.092
Actually, it's only 43, but take it.
You never know.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.719
I have enough money, but thanks.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.721
Okay.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.349
Well, good luck, Kyle.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.017
You too, Mike.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.567
Hello.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.111
Yes, it is.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.655
Who is it?

25:33.198 --> 25:34.448
What?

25:35.951 --> 25:38.327
Take care, fellas.
Yeah, all right, Mike.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.664
So, what happened?
I decided not to go home.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.708
Then you decided you'd break
into your grandfather's house?

25:45.043 --> 25:49.630
You mind if I have a quick smoke?
Yes, I do. Get in the car.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.471
You wanna talk about it?

25:58.431 --> 25:59.640
Not really.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.103
Well, good luck with that, pal.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.566
Oh, you'll see.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.782
Kyle, we can't help you
unless you tell us what's going on.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.159
Is there a reason
you don't wanna go home?

26:20.537 --> 26:22.371
What happened to your eye?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.083
Kyle, you can trust us.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.876
Really.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.798
I can't live there anymore.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.969
With your mom?
Did she do that to your eye?

26:37.304 --> 26:42.224
No. She's not even there.
She's at a clinic or hospital or something.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.727
I'm living with Craig.
Who's Craig?

26:45.186 --> 26:47.521
Her boyfriend, I guess.
But he's an asshole.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.816
Does she even know you're here?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.861
My mom? She doesn't care about me.

26:54.237 --> 26:57.990
How do you know? She's probably worried
sick and doesn't know how to reach you.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.119
She could've called, right?

27:13.048 --> 27:16.300
We don't have a choice.
Ah. What are we gonna do, adopt him?

27:16.468 --> 27:17.551
No.

27:19.137 --> 27:23.182
But I'm not sending him back there until
I talk to his mom. She better call me back.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.808
Honey...

27:26.311 --> 27:28.354
Honey, I know that this is tough...

27:28.521 --> 27:31.732
...but we're not in a position
to take care of another kid right now.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.527
I don't care. I'm not sending him
back there. I can't.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.529
For the record, I'm not happy about it.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.907
Fine. Then we don't have to do this.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.493
Yes, we do, Mike. We do.

27:43.244 --> 27:48.123
It makes me so angry and so damn sad
to see him in this situation. He's just a kid.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.834
Yeah, I know. I know.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.088
I wanna go to Ohio
and beat the crap out of his mom.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.466
Okay, come on.
No, I do.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.259
I wanna beat the crap out of her...

27:59.427 --> 28:01.220
...and her stupid boyfriend.
Okay.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.180
I'm serious.
I know you are.

28:03.348 --> 28:08.310
I just don't think that beating the crap out
of everybody is the best solution. That's all.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.145
It feels like it.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.065
It's just one thing after another.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.441
So get rid of him again.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.820
I can't. We gotta figure out
what's going on back there.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.446
You talked to his mother?

28:19.614 --> 28:22.533
Not yet. Jackie's left her like 30 messages.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.410
She's driving me crazy.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.204
Motherfucker. He is wearing his tool belt.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.039
What? Who?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.709
No, nothing, dude. Sorry. I'm distracted.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.461
Where are you?
Are you watching Lori's house again?

28:34.629 --> 28:36.630
It's my fucking house. And, no.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.425
I'm driving. Where's the kid now?

28:39.592 --> 28:42.302
In my waiting room.
Jackie made me take him with me.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.638
Listen to me, Mike. You listening?
Mm-hm.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.808
This isn't the time
to long that stock. Know what I mean?

28:48.143 --> 28:49.601
No. What does that mean?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.854
You need to do what's best for you now.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.482
That's not taking care of another kid,
especially a convict.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.444
Yeah. Well, tell that to my wife, okay?

28:58.611 --> 28:59.987
I found her.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.823
Let me call you back.
Get rid of the convict, Mike.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.827
She's in a drug treatment program
in Columbus. Got five weeks to go.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.871
Jesus Christ. Can I talk to her?

29:09.330 --> 29:10.998
No, they said she would call you.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.254
Kind of a sweet kid,
but what's up with the hair?

29:18.673 --> 29:20.299
Who the hell knows? Yeah?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.844
Hey, Mike. Hey, Shelly.
Hi.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.929
You think I can go see Leo?

29:26.097 --> 29:28.682
Um, yeah, sure. Okay.
You know where it is?

29:28.850 --> 29:31.101
Yeah. Down the street, right?
Uh-huh.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.521
Okay. But just stay there.
I will come get you about 3.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.356
Yeah. Later.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.734
Later.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.863
Kill me

29:43.031 --> 29:45.032
Just kill me

29:45.200 --> 29:48.202
Just kill, kill

29:48.369 --> 29:50.370
Kill me now
Kill me, kill me

29:50.789 --> 29:53.832
Oh, for crying out loud.
Rew, what the hell are you doing?

29:55.502 --> 29:58.712
Get down there. Coach!
Phil, shut that off.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.339
Watch it, guys.

30:00.507 --> 30:04.051
Everybody, watch this. Everybody, watch,
because none of you are doing it right.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.054
Get your chest on him.
That's a little too much.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.555
A little further back, coach.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.642
Like this?
Good, right there.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.895
Get your full weight up on your toes.
Put your full weight on him.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.898
Like that. Cross-face, grab the ankle,
and drive right through.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.442
Good.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.903
What up, pancake?
Shut up, Chewbacca.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.240
More like the Secret Apprentice.
What are you, 10?

30:26.407 --> 30:29.576
Wookiees wouldn't survive on the-
Hey! Hey!

30:30.245 --> 30:33.163
We are trying
to teach you something here!

30:33.331 --> 30:35.707
And you are all screwing around.
Shut up!

30:35.875 --> 30:37.084
Quiet!

30:37.252 --> 30:41.922
The last time that I checked, we haven't
won a single match. Right, coach?

30:42.090 --> 30:43.882
It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing!

30:44.050 --> 30:47.761
I'm not getting paid enough to sit here
and jerk around. I don't know about you.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.096
I'm not getting enough.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.600
I care about what I do!
So does Coach Vig! And so should you!

30:54.602 --> 30:55.936
Run them, coach. Run them.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.355
I can't stand looking
at these punks anymore.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.940
Let's go, ladies!

31:05.071 --> 31:06.113
Here.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.824
Have some more corn.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.995
Thank you.
I'll get you some more milk too.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.329
Thanks.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.124
Mike, did you call Fenn about the tree?

31:18.793 --> 31:22.129
Yeah. But I talked to Terry,
and I think the two of us can do this-

31:22.297 --> 31:25.132
Oh, no, no, don't start.
You two are not cutting down that tree.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.802
Just call Fenn.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.722
I'm gonna get her some Tylenol.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.975
Do you wanna play croquet?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.145
When?
When it's warm out.

31:39.439 --> 31:42.357
Yeah. Maybe.
Cool.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.779
Daddy, can I watch TV?

31:48.156 --> 31:50.949
Yes, you can.
But just a half an hour, all right?

31:54.829 --> 31:55.829
Hey, Mike.
Mm-hm.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.665
You think I could practice
with you guys tomorrow?

31:59.334 --> 32:01.001
Yeah, if you want. Sure.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.836
All right, thanks.

32:03.171 --> 32:07.257
By the way, what I did in there today,
yelling like that, I don't usually do that.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.676
That's okay. They deserved it.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.187
I don't have wrestling shoes.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.857
Don't worry about it. You wrestle before?
Yeah.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.527
Take it easy, all right?
All right.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.446
Come on, get an ankle! Get an ankle.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.992
Vig, can I have a second here?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.036
Thanks. Okay, guys...

32:36.204 --> 32:40.874
...listen up. Kyle here's gonna be
working out with us for a little while. Okay?

32:41.042 --> 32:44.711
What up, Kyle?
Carlos, you and Jimmy rotate him in.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.048
You got 10 seconds to get an ankle,
then we switch it up.

32:48.383 --> 32:51.677
He'll try to take you down first,
then switch. Take it easy.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.178
Okay, here we go.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.061
Fahrenheit 101

33:01.229 --> 33:04.898
She got the long legs to prove it

33:06.275 --> 33:08.652
Switch it up. Here we go.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.531
She's a triple-X movie just walking by

33:12.699 --> 33:16.076
Lip gloss, high heels
I'm losing my mind

33:16.244 --> 33:19.746
She's coming at me like a wrecking ball

33:36.222 --> 33:37.931
Man, it's cold.

33:38.599 --> 33:41.101
You have fun?
Yeah.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.895
When's the last time you wrestled?
Couple years ago.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.649
Why'd you stop?
Just felt like it.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.612
Hey, let me ask you something, Kyle.

33:53.614 --> 33:54.948
How good are you?

33:55.616 --> 33:57.117
I'm pretty good.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.259
Did you see it?

34:14.427 --> 34:16.803
This is the kid? Kyle Timmons?
That's the kid.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.138
Wow.
Yeah, right?

34:18.306 --> 34:21.641
He finished second at the states in Ohio.
Ohio's tough, dude.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.228
Says he had 17 pins his freshman year.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.355
What is that?
I'm playing Wii Golf.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.274
Oh. That's cool.
Yeah, I'm awesome.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.109
What'd he do his sophomore year?

34:31.277 --> 34:34.362
I don't know. I couldn't find anything.
I don't think he wrestled.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.739
Why?
I don't know.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.199
He doesn't talk much.
He's kind of a weird kid.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.869
Want another beer?
Yeah.

34:41.536 --> 34:45.748
Why can't I have one kid
on my team like that, you know? Just one.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.335
Well, you do. Right there.

34:48.668 --> 34:50.045
Take that kid to states.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.632
He's not on the team. He's not
even a student. Been here for three days.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.217
So what? Enroll him.

34:55.384 --> 35:00.055
I can't enroll him. He's just here until we
reach his mother and we figure this out.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.849
All right. So he's gotta do something.
Let him wrestle.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.518
That's a nice bowl, man.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.853
Yeah. Wedding gift. Yeah.
Oh.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.022
Dude, look at it this way.

35:09.357 --> 35:13.693
You're helping the old man out, and this kid
is like a bonus for doing the right thing.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.530
Yeah, I'm not just
helping the old man out.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.534
It's not like it's charity work, you know?
I'm getting paid for it.

35:20.701 --> 35:25.539
Yeah, no shit, Mike. Everybody gets paid.
But, dude, think about it, all right?

35:25.706 --> 35:30.919
What are the odds of this kid ending up
on your doorstep and wrestling like that?

35:31.546 --> 35:33.046
That's a sign.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.341
Check it out. One of his matches.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.392
He's setting him up. See?
He's setting him up. He's gonna throw him.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.726
There he goes.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.064
Oh, my God!
High five! Yes!

35:54.110 --> 35:55.735
Okay.

35:55.903 --> 35:59.906
Here's $5 for lunch. I don't know what it
costs. But let me know when you find out.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.825
I have money, but thanks.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.995
Good for you. Save it.
Come on, take it. It's too early to argue.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.540
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go, pal.
All right.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.916
See you tonight.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.418
Bye, Jackie.
Bye.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.920
Hey.
Yeah. Hold on.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.256
You sure we should do this?

36:16.424 --> 36:20.760
Why not? I mean, if he's here two more days
or two weeks, it gives him something to do.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.597
Unless you want him hanging out here.

36:24.807 --> 36:27.767
No, you're right. We should do it.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.781
Hey, Mike.
Uh-huh?

36:43.117 --> 36:47.579
We got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for
1500, but it's made out to you, not the firm.

36:47.747 --> 36:51.291
Uh-huh. Yeah, right. I'll take that.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.293
Shouldn't I deposit it
in the business account?

36:54.670 --> 36:57.714
No, it's not a legal fee, it's a personal fee.
For what?

36:58.466 --> 37:02.052
I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship.
Really?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.805
Yeah. Didn't I mention that to you?
You definitely didn't mention that.

37:05.973 --> 37:09.476
Yeah. It ended up playing out that way.
I gotta get going, okay?

37:09.644 --> 37:13.563
Can we put some of that in the business
account so they don't take our copier back?

37:13.731 --> 37:17.025
No, not this time.
Next month, I promise. Bye, Shelly.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.821
We need our copier, Mike.
I know.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.824
That noise is getting louder.
I'm not hungover today.

37:24.992 --> 37:27.661
That's good.
That's good?

37:29.163 --> 37:30.538
Hey, honey.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.876
No, I'm good.
Yeah, listen, can you do me a favor?

37:35.044 --> 37:38.004
Mail the health insurance check.
I forgot to mail it.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.217
I think it's on the desk.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.640
Hey. What up, fellas?

37:48.808 --> 37:50.684
Hitting the showers, huh?

37:51.769 --> 37:53.353
That sounded weird.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.689
The guy's unbelievable.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.649
You want me to talk to Reed?

37:57.817 --> 37:59.859
No, let me check with Kyle first.

38:00.027 --> 38:04.114
Oh, yeah, coaches' office. Hey, Vig.
Hey, Terry.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.365
What are you doing here?

38:05.533 --> 38:07.951
What am I doing here?
What do you think? I gotta see this kid.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.871
He's incredible.
He's good to wrestle. Mike cleared him.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.331
Really?

38:13.499 --> 38:15.000
Yeah.
All right.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.003
So where we at?

38:18.963 --> 38:21.881
Uh, we're trying to figure out
where he fits in.

38:22.049 --> 38:25.719
Heh. Wherever the hell he wants, right?
Uh, no, not right.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.221
Unfortunately, we have a system here.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.307
Excuse me, Vig.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.561
Hey, Kyle. Come on in. How's school?

38:35.271 --> 38:38.064
It's okay.
Good. This is my friend Terry.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.568
Hey, man. Good to meet you.
Great to meet you. Welcome.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.071
Thanks.
Terry. Terry.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.949
How are the shoes?
They're good.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.409
Good.
Here you go.

38:49.577 --> 38:53.580
I wanted to ask you something, Kyle.
Think you might wanna wrestle in a match?

38:53.748 --> 38:54.914
Okay.

38:55.416 --> 38:58.835
Good. We got one on Saturday.
What do you wrestle?

38:59.295 --> 39:03.089
I used to wrestle 103,
but that's not gonna happen.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.342
I could make 119 by Saturday.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.093
Excellent. Done.
Ter.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.345
Sorry.

39:08.512 --> 39:12.265
Is there anyone there now?
Jimmy Reed, but he's not very good.

39:12.933 --> 39:16.853
Yeah, but he might actually
be better off at 125, Vig.

39:17.271 --> 39:21.608
Don't you think we should wrestle off?
Yeah.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.154
There's no place I'd rather be
Than anywhere else but here

39:26.322 --> 39:29.032
Can't you see that I'm
Sick and tired of all the bullshit

39:29.200 --> 39:30.492
Good luck, man.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.660
Thanks.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.830
Okay, let's get them started.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.583
Wrestle off!

39:38.751 --> 39:41.920
All right, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

39:42.546 --> 39:46.674
Keep time, Vig.
I'll do it. You don't mind, do you?

39:47.343 --> 39:48.635
No, go ahead.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.638
Nice.
What?

39:51.806 --> 39:54.307
Let's go, guys. Shake hands.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.491
That is really fast. That's really fast.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.992
Yes!

40:14.161 --> 40:16.371
Good match.
Didn't feel good.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.540
I don't think we can teach him anything.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.003
Just being in that place
brought back all the memories, I gotta say.

40:24.338 --> 40:27.340
The smell. It's like a form of self-abuse.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.008
Were you guys really that bad?

40:29.176 --> 40:30.802
Mike was average.
Yeah.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.304
Right? I sucked. Sorry, Abby.

40:33.472 --> 40:34.681
That's okay.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.516
You were really better than Terry?

40:36.684 --> 40:41.271
Yeah. Mike was scrappy. Abby, your dad was
like an angry little ferret when he wrestled.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.274
We should have joined the ski club.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.485
We could have gotten busy
with Alison Shepherd on overnights.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.821
Terry.
Who was busy?

40:50.072 --> 40:51.990
Your Uncle Terry's just being silly.

40:52.158 --> 40:55.618
Sorry, Abby. Getting busy is bad.
Ha, ha.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.954
So is getting married.
For crying out loud.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.664
Getting married is bad?

40:59.832 --> 41:03.793
Different viewpoints are important. Right?
No, not right, Terry.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.212
You really need to get back up
on the horse.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.173
Okay, Mom.
We should go.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.883
I have to stop by the office.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.680
How do you think
we'd do against Kyle, like, now?

41:16.098 --> 41:19.225
Are you kidding me? He'd kill us.
Both of us, together.

41:19.393 --> 41:22.103
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.063
Kid's got man strength, dude.

41:24.440 --> 41:28.318
Man strength?
Mm. Like, not kid strength, man strength.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.529
I wouldn't say that
around the locker room, Terry.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.781
What are you doing in there?

41:33.949 --> 41:37.327
Trying to figure out what's wrong
with my fricking backup system.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.120
Just call your IT guy.

41:39.288 --> 41:43.291
I don't have an IT guy. IT guys cost money.
Right.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.713
You know what?
I'm just gonna say what's on my mind here.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.591
I wanna be an assistant coach too.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.176
Seriously?
Yeah. Why not?

41:53.344 --> 41:56.554
Dude, I'm value added,
especially compared to Vig.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.056
How are you value added?

41:58.224 --> 42:00.850
Well, first of all, I'm fun.
There's no denying that.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.937
Secondly, unlike Vig,
I actually used to wrestle.

42:04.104 --> 42:05.438
Yeah, but, Ter, you sucked.

42:05.606 --> 42:07.607
Mike, come on. I'm serious here.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.819
I need some distraction in my life
right now. I'm sitting in that condo...

42:11.987 --> 42:14.030
...just thinking about Lori and that guy...

42:14.198 --> 42:17.283
...having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for.
It's fucking unhealthy.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.203
I'm going kind of crazy right now.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.121
Really.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.377
We start at 3:30 p.m.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.462
Don't be late.

42:29.630 --> 42:33.049
My brother.
Hey, I'm not gonna let you down.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.220
To the team.
All right.

42:38.597 --> 42:41.766
What should I wear to my first practice?
Just a singlet.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.645
Seriously?
Yeah, so we can see your man strength.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.733
Incoming call. Do you copy?

42:50.901 --> 42:55.697
Incoming call. Charlie Squadron
taking heavy fire. Requesting air strike-

42:55.864 --> 42:59.450
Hello. Hello?

43:00.160 --> 43:03.204
This is Jackie Flaherty.
Kyle's staying with us.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.542
I am gonna kill that lady.

43:11.505 --> 43:14.007
Your phone rang. Your mom called.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.301
You answered it?

43:16.719 --> 43:18.928
Yeah. We've been waiting
to hear from her.

43:19.513 --> 43:20.847
What'd she say?

43:21.348 --> 43:25.184
She didn't say anything. She hung up.
You talk to her?

43:25.352 --> 43:28.479
No, but can you please not
answer my phone anymore?

43:29.857 --> 43:33.359
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

43:36.530 --> 43:39.907
Here. You shouldn't be smoking,
but if you do...

43:40.075 --> 43:43.036
...could you put the butts out in here?
I quit.

43:43.203 --> 43:46.873
Now that I'm wrestling again,
I can't smoke.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.625
Pretty cool, right?

43:50.252 --> 43:52.545
Yeah, it's very cool.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.055
Was that Abby?

44:02.222 --> 44:04.599
If it is, she just ran away.

44:19.907 --> 44:23.159
Hey. Were you outside?

44:23.327 --> 44:24.827
Yeah. I went for a run.

44:26.955 --> 44:30.041
It's pretty early.
You do that every morning?

44:30.918 --> 44:32.585
In season, yeah.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.674
You think I can use the weights
in the closet?

44:38.300 --> 44:40.093
Absolutely. Help yourself.

44:40.594 --> 44:43.554
All right. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

44:48.435 --> 44:51.562
That was Kyle. He was working out.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.773
Is he gonna do that
every morning?

44:53.941 --> 44:55.942
In season, yeah.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.277
I hate you.

45:02.324 --> 45:03.616
Timmons.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.495
One-nineteen. Good.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.414
One-nineteen, got it.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.290
Look at those tattoos.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.292
Kid is so fricking cool.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.296
125, Dreadlow.

45:19.425 --> 45:21.134
Now's the revolution
They're pushin' you down

45:21.301 --> 45:23.094
They got it, you want it
Don't give it up

45:23.262 --> 45:24.387
Now's the revolution

45:24.555 --> 45:26.389
All you, dude.

45:26.598 --> 45:28.099
It has to start sometime

45:28.267 --> 45:31.144
Now's the revolution
They're pushin' you down

45:31.311 --> 45:32.937
They got it, you want it
Don't give it up

45:33.105 --> 45:36.149
This song sucks.
Rew picked it. He's an odd one.

45:36.316 --> 45:38.860
Vig, which one is your kid?
None of them. He quit.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.319
Really? Your son quit?

45:40.487 --> 45:42.613
My stepson.
I thought it'd be a nice way to bond...

45:42.781 --> 45:44.782
...but he said it wasn't fierce and quit.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.243
Harsh. So what are you still doing it for?

45:47.411 --> 45:50.121
Vig is leading by example.
Winners never quit, right?

45:50.289 --> 45:52.498
That's right, even if I'm not fierce.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.876
Um, I sit there.

45:55.043 --> 45:57.336
Sorry, I gotta sit next to Mike.
It's good luck.

45:57.504 --> 45:58.504
Says who?

45:58.672 --> 46:02.425
Guys. Guys. I don't think we should fight
about our seats in front of the kids.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.677
I'm not really fighting.
Come on.

46:07.514 --> 46:09.390
All right. Sit wherever you want.

46:12.519 --> 46:14.187
I feel overdressed.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.024
Let's go.
Don't worry about it.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.650
I always sit there.

46:19.818 --> 46:20.943
First day.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.409
Up! There you go! Shoot!

46:28.577 --> 46:30.495
Take him down, Carlos! Come on.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.540
There you go.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.126
All right, Carlos.

46:41.715 --> 46:42.757
All right.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.550
Good match.
Yeah, great, thanks.

46:45.135 --> 46:48.137
Hey. Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

46:48.305 --> 46:53.142
Okay. This kid is good, so, you know,
you just be ready out there.

46:53.310 --> 46:57.688
Okay. Can you give me a slap?
What?

46:58.023 --> 47:00.733
Slap me across the face,
like you're trying to wake me up.

47:00.901 --> 47:03.402
Okay. Like that?

47:03.904 --> 47:05.655
Yeah, but a little harder.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.492
Go ahead,
hit him.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.248
Timmons.
Let's go, Kyle!

47:15.749 --> 47:17.416
Let's go, Kyle. Take this punk out!

47:17.584 --> 47:21.712
Oh, Terry, hey, cut the shit, man. You're
a coach. You're not sitting in the stands.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.090
I get excited. You know how I get.
I know.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.884
I'm just coaching. Come on, buddy.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.433
Okay, Kyle.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.353
Let's go, Kyle!
Get your head up!

47:43.777 --> 47:45.361
Focus up.
Go on, Kyle!

47:47.114 --> 47:48.447
Fresh start.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.205
Get out of that.
Keep the leg back!

47:56.373 --> 47:58.082
Get out of that.
Get out, Kyle.

47:59.084 --> 48:00.501
Two, red.

48:02.796 --> 48:04.714
Get back on base!

48:07.593 --> 48:09.176
What the hell is he doing?
Losing.

48:09.344 --> 48:11.470
It's his first match, give him a break.

48:12.764 --> 48:15.182
Eye on the prize, eye on the prize.

48:18.812 --> 48:20.646
You okay?

48:23.108 --> 48:25.318
Did he smile?
Yeah, I think he did.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.163
Hey, beautiful!

48:37.331 --> 48:38.915
Here we go!

48:40.709 --> 48:42.335
Pioneers!
Nice.

48:42.502 --> 48:45.838
Told you I'm good luck.
Had nothing to do with luck.

48:46.006 --> 48:48.758
Beautiful. How'd that feel? Pretty good?

48:49.134 --> 48:51.052
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.471
You ready?
Yeah. Can you slap me too, coach?

48:58.018 --> 49:00.478
Well, I said you cannot
touch the other gloves...

49:00.646 --> 49:03.439
I'm off to the market. Be back in a bit.

49:03.857 --> 49:07.568
Can I go with you?
Uh, yeah, okay.

49:07.736 --> 49:10.571
All right.
Let me grab my sweatshirt real quick.

49:13.825 --> 49:15.618
I wanna go with Kyle.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.537
No, sweetheart, it's almost time for bed.

49:18.705 --> 49:20.581
Please?
No.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.296
Oh, Cocoa Puffs. Is that your brand?

49:27.464 --> 49:28.547
No, they're for Leo.

49:28.715 --> 49:30.925
How nice. Drop it in. It's on me.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.386
Go ahead.
Thanks.

49:34.388 --> 49:35.721
How's he doing?

49:36.890 --> 49:40.309
He's okay. He can say
some pretty funny things, though.

49:40.477 --> 49:43.854
The other day he told me I was fired.
Fired? For what?

49:44.231 --> 49:46.273
I don't know. He just fired me.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.901
Hmm, I think I have to meet this Leo.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.070
Grab me two spaghettis.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.031
Thanks.

49:54.199 --> 49:58.577
Do you have any homework?
A little. I hate homework.

49:58.912 --> 50:01.080
You ever think of going to college?

50:01.415 --> 50:05.167
Yeah, but just to wrestle. My old coach
thought I could get a scholarship.

50:05.335 --> 50:07.837
Yeah, I heard you were pretty good.
Why'd you quit?

50:11.925 --> 50:14.385
That's okay. You don't have to tell me.

50:15.929 --> 50:18.097
You like tacos?
Yeah.

50:18.598 --> 50:22.685
Me too. I make a mean taco.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.941
Let's go! Let's stay focused!
Focus, guys! Good things will come!

50:29.609 --> 50:32.153
Okay, coach, let's bring them in.

50:33.530 --> 50:35.114
Come on!
Let's go. Sit down, everybody!

50:35.282 --> 50:37.116
Have a seat.
Bring it in.

50:38.952 --> 50:40.286
All right.

50:40.787 --> 50:43.122
I wanna spend this week
working on bottom position.

50:45.792 --> 50:50.046
Now, did you guys all see what Kyle did
the other day? He exploded up, right?

50:50.213 --> 50:51.964
Kyle, show the guys what you did.

50:53.633 --> 50:55.051
It's kind of my own thing.

50:55.635 --> 50:57.136
Well, can you share it with us?

50:57.888 --> 51:01.474
But it's not even a move or anything.
That's okay.

51:01.641 --> 51:03.142
All right.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.645
Well, I just tell myself that...

51:07.022 --> 51:11.025
...the guy on top is trying to take my head
and shove it underwater and kill me.

51:12.277 --> 51:17.031
And if I don't wanna die on bottom, I have
to do whatever the fuck it takes to get out.

51:20.535 --> 51:25.498
Okay. So the move is, "whatever
the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's work on it!

51:25.874 --> 51:30.002
Whatever the fuck it takes! Let's go! Up!
Come on, guys.

51:30.921 --> 51:34.256
You think because you pay the bills,
you have the right for all the say...

51:34.424 --> 51:36.842
...you don't see to her,
you don't care for her...

51:37.010 --> 51:38.594
Your mother wouldn't come, huh?

51:39.387 --> 51:42.348
No.
That girl was always a tough kid.

51:43.391 --> 51:45.309
She say bad things about me?

51:46.019 --> 51:48.479
Yeah, but I never listen to her anyways.

51:49.022 --> 51:51.398
But you should. That's your mother.

51:51.566 --> 51:53.442
Respect that.

51:53.610 --> 51:56.695
Could you turn that down?
I hate that judge.

51:56.863 --> 51:58.823
She's the reason I'm here.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.618
But, Leo, this place is pretty nice.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.328
But it's not my house.

52:04.871 --> 52:06.705
I paid for my house.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.874
I own my house!

52:09.042 --> 52:10.960
Damn judge. Shut it off!

52:11.128 --> 52:14.088
- this woman $1500
in transition-

52:21.346 --> 52:24.014
You wanna go for a walk outside, Leo?

52:26.560 --> 52:29.270
Yeah. Let's go to my park.

52:30.438 --> 52:32.064
Your park?

52:32.774 --> 52:34.441
Yeah, my park.

52:35.402 --> 52:38.571
Hey, did you bring the tape?
Yeah, it's in my bag.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.074
Mike, can I ask you something?
Mm-hm. Yeah.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.742
Of course. What?

52:44.911 --> 52:47.872
Leo told me that some judge
made him move into that place.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.917
He said that, huh?
Yeah. Is that true, or is he just making it up?

52:56.756 --> 52:58.757
No, that's true, pal.

52:58.925 --> 53:00.759
Why?
Well...

53:00.927 --> 53:04.138
...because they take
really good care of him there, you know?

53:05.098 --> 53:08.767
But he wants to live at home.
Oh. I know.

53:08.935 --> 53:11.270
I know. It's, uh, complicated.

53:13.064 --> 53:14.440
Sorry.

53:15.567 --> 53:16.942
Hello.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.028
Yes, this is him.

53:22.157 --> 53:26.160
Yeah, can you hold on just a moment,
please? Thanks.

53:26.661 --> 53:28.621
Uh, I gotta take this.

53:29.497 --> 53:31.248
I'll be in in a minute, okay?

53:31.416 --> 53:33.500
All right.
Thanks.

53:40.550 --> 53:42.968
What? She doesn't even know us.

53:43.136 --> 53:45.804
I think she heard that I'm a lawyer,
and I have a family...

53:45.972 --> 53:47.389
...and that was good enough.

53:47.557 --> 53:49.225
For how long?
Another month.

53:49.392 --> 53:51.560
Until she gets out of rehab.
A month?

53:51.728 --> 53:53.437
Yes.
Holy crap.

53:53.605 --> 53:56.148
But, you know, she said
that this Craig guy took off...

53:56.316 --> 53:58.317
...and she really sounded kind of shaky.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.402
I can't believe this lady.

54:01.780 --> 54:02.821
No, I know.

54:02.989 --> 54:06.659
Where is he, anyway?
In the basement with Abby.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.245
This is crazy.
Yes, it is.

54:09.996 --> 54:11.580
So, what do we do?

54:13.083 --> 54:16.502
We let him stay. I don't know.
Do we even have a choice?

54:16.836 --> 54:18.462
I guess we don't.

54:33.186 --> 54:34.645
What's up?

54:34.980 --> 54:37.439
You nervous?
No.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.108
I am.

54:39.651 --> 54:43.946
You're not wrestling.
Yeah, I know, I'm just nervous a lot.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.282
Ever think about wrestling in a match?

54:46.449 --> 54:49.201
I'm just waiting for the green light
from coach, you know?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.996
Yeah. That's cool.

54:52.163 --> 54:54.623
Dude, I'm glad I'm not wrestling today.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.542
These guys are ranked fourth in state.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.878
You're wrestling Kenny Randall.
He's undefeated. He's tough.

55:00.046 --> 55:01.547
Really tough.

55:01.715 --> 55:03.716
Whole team's tough.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.343
I hate going to this fricking place.

55:07.053 --> 55:08.721
Maybe that's why you're nervous.

55:10.056 --> 55:12.725
Yeah. Maybe.

55:12.892 --> 55:15.060
All right, cut the chatter! Cut the chatter!

55:17.564 --> 55:20.357
Now, you should all be playing
the "What If" game.

55:20.525 --> 55:22.026
What if he shoots a single leg?

55:22.193 --> 55:25.404
What if he controls my wrist?
What if we all got pinned like last year?

55:25.572 --> 55:28.866
Stemler, I swear to God, I'm gonna
throw you right off this bus myself.

55:29.034 --> 55:31.327
Now, shut up.
My bad, Coach Vig.

55:31.494 --> 55:32.828
Shut up!

55:33.913 --> 55:36.040
Way to go, Stemler.
Shut up, Stemler.

55:40.253 --> 55:43.380
They really pin all of you?
Just about.

55:44.090 --> 55:46.216
It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath.

56:03.777 --> 56:06.320
All right, Carlos. Kyle.

56:08.198 --> 56:10.949
Okay. This is Kenny Randall.
He's very good.

56:11.117 --> 56:13.786
Yeah, I heard.
All right, but you have an advantage here.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.955
He has no idea who you are, right?
He's gonna be over-confident.

56:17.123 --> 56:19.917
Take advantage of that.
He's gonna come at you, definitely.

56:20.293 --> 56:23.462
Use his momentum, take a shot,
and put him away. Okay?

56:23.630 --> 56:24.880
Okay.
Yeah?

56:25.048 --> 56:26.715
And Randall, Sheffield.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.180
Why'd Daddy hit Kyle?
I have no idea.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.140
Come on, guys.
Focus, Kyle, focus.

56:35.308 --> 56:37.226
Let's go, baby. Let's go, Kyle!

56:37.394 --> 56:41.480
Look alive! Look alive!
Let's go, come on! Come on!

56:42.148 --> 56:43.482
Be a winner, Kyle!

56:43.650 --> 56:46.693
Shake hands.
Don't wait. Go after him.

56:48.863 --> 56:51.990
Take your time, Kenny.
Work around, take him down.

56:54.577 --> 56:56.161
No way.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.839
He just pinned Kenny Randall.
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

57:07.006 --> 57:10.134
Guys, guys, guys, calm down.
Calm down, calm down, all right?

57:11.177 --> 57:13.011
There you go, Kyle!
How about that?

57:13.179 --> 57:16.515
He knows who I am now.
You're goddamned right he does!

57:27.068 --> 57:29.403
Can I watch TV in here?
Oh, yeah.

57:29.571 --> 57:32.030
Oh. Wait, I wanna
show you something first.

57:32.198 --> 57:35.367
Stella, who's that?
Kyle.

57:37.245 --> 57:39.955
She started doing that
at the wrestling match today.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.790
That's cool.
Yeah.

57:41.958 --> 57:46.086
Okay, I gotta ask. Those tattoos.
They must have hurt, right?

57:46.254 --> 57:48.922
Not really.
No, come on, don't lie to me.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.466
Look.

57:50.633 --> 57:53.051
I got it on spring break. Hurt like hell.

57:53.219 --> 57:55.762
What does it say?
J.B.J.

57:55.930 --> 57:58.307
Jon Bon Jovi? I'm a fan.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.392
Really?
Yes, really.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.895
I'm a Jersey girl.
You got a problem with that?

58:03.062 --> 58:05.522
No, I do not.

58:07.066 --> 58:09.860
That was fun today. You're good.

58:10.028 --> 58:13.489
I'm glad you started wrestling again.
Yeah. Me too.

58:13.656 --> 58:16.074
No quitting this time. You got that?

58:16.242 --> 58:17.743
Yeah.

58:18.203 --> 58:21.413
Can I tell you something?
Of course.

58:21.581 --> 58:24.416
I didn't quit my old wrestling team.

58:25.043 --> 58:26.335
I got thrown off.

58:27.045 --> 58:30.255
Why?
I stole a car.

58:30.798 --> 58:33.091
What? You don't even drive, do you?

58:33.259 --> 58:34.635
No.

58:34.802 --> 58:36.261
That was part of the problem.

58:36.429 --> 58:39.223
Whose car did you steal?
A teacher's.

58:39.390 --> 58:41.433
Oh, my God.
I know.

58:41.601 --> 58:44.269
It was really stupid.
Yeah, it was really stupid.

58:44.437 --> 58:47.189
You could have killed yourself.
Yeah.

58:47.982 --> 58:50.984
Everything just got messed up after that.

58:53.154 --> 58:56.031
Hey. We all do stupid things.

58:56.616 --> 58:58.951
But the good news is
you got another chance.

58:59.118 --> 59:00.619
And you're kicking butt.

59:01.120 --> 59:04.414
That's the way to do it.
Yeah, I guess.

59:04.832 --> 59:07.459
Oh, totally is.
You know who'd agree with me?

59:08.002 --> 59:09.461
Mike?
No.

59:10.463 --> 59:12.923
J.B.J.

59:22.308 --> 59:26.395
Why you wanna tell me
How to live my life?

59:29.440 --> 59:33.026
Who are you to tell me
If it's black or white?

59:36.948 --> 59:40.075
Mama, can you hear me?
Try to understand

59:40.243 --> 59:43.912
Is innocence the difference
Between a boy and a man?

59:44.080 --> 59:47.583
My daddy lived a lie
That's just the price that he paid

59:47.750 --> 59:51.503
Sacrificed his life just slaving away

59:51.671 --> 59:56.592
If there's one thing I hang on to

59:56.759 --> 59:59.303
That gets me through the night

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.181
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:05.267
Gotcha.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.602
Too hard, bro.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.688
Shining like a diamond
Rolling with the dice

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:12.107
Good?
Yeah, go!

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.867
Awesome.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.996
Yeah, baby!

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.289
Have a nice day

01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:32.419
They don't have a heavyweight.
Really?

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.129
No.
Korsic will be happy.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.174
Tell him so he doesn't puke.
He doesn't have to lose weight.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.676
Why's he puking?
Nerves.

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:40.969
Ner-

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:43.180
Oh, well, this is a team for the ages.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:46.224
Hey, guys. What's up?
Stemler wants to wrestle today.

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:48.226
Ter.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.521
You do?
Yeah, coach.

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:54.399
I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right?

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.901
Right.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.820
Where you gonna wrestle, Stemler?

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.572
He can wrestle at 119.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.201
If I bump up to 125 and get a pin,
and Jimmy goes 130...

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.954
...then we're only giving up one weight
class and we actually have a shot.

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:11.583
Vig?
Yeah. He's right.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.168
It's possible.
Stemler...

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:17.255
...have you ever wrestled in a match before?
No, I have not.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:21.718
He's just waiting for the green light, right?
Right.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.096
I think now's my time.

01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:25.889
I feel the force.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.232
One twenty-five.
Okay.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.944
Okay, we're gonna start 125,
DePasquale and Timmons.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:44.116
And then finish 119,
Tomlinson and Stemler.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.076
I'm ready, coach.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:50.205
Showtime.
Good.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.040
Oh, boy.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.000
It's gonna be fine.

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:57.754
Hook him, come on! That's it!
Now hold on to him!

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.424
Hook the arm, Carlos, that's it!
Stay on him!

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:01.800
Hang on to him! Hang on to him!

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:04.720
Yeah!
Very good.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.471
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:09.558
Great, Carlos! Awesome.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.727
How we doing?
Shit, we can win this thing.

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:14.521
If Stemler doesn't get pinned,
we can win. We're up five.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.774
That's a huge fucking "if."
I can hear you, coach.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:21.361
Sorry, Stemler.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.157
Okay, come on, Stemler, let's go.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.200
Okay.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:28.952
All right, buddy.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.164
You've been practicing a long time.

01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:33.665
A long time.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.667
And you're ready for this, okay?

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.670
You get in trouble,
you just listen to me. I'm right here.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.213
Okay? All right?

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:43.467
Stemler, you're not gonna get pinned.
You are not gonna get pinned.

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:46.595
No way, all right?
Now, I'm gonna slap you. You ready?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.680
Yeah, but not so hard.

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:54.311
Thanks.
Okay.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:55.729
Let's get this going here!

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.273
You gotta check in.
Sign in.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.318
Let's go, Stem! Let's go!

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.529
You got this!

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.954
Holy shit, it's Darth Vader.
Are you kidding me?

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.206
No way.
What?

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:15.499
I can't do this.
No.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.542
What are you-?
Don't take that off.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.255
It's just a mask.
For chrissake, Stemler.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.508
Stemler.
It's a protective mask.

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:25.717
What's going on?

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:30.263
If he's Darth Vader,
you're the Secret Apprentice.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.224
You got this.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.520
Ref, what's he doing?

01:03:37.438 --> 01:03:38.480
Okay?

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.065
All right.
Let's go.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.400
All right, Stemler.
Let's go, Stem.

01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:44.820
Good man, let's go. Let's go.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.488
All over him. Right here.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.198
Shake hands.
Don't give an inch.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:51.201
All right, Stemler.
All right.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.954
Good.
All right.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:56.081
Okay.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:59.251
Thattaboy. Good start. All right.

01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:03.672
Just keep trying.
I can't watch this.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.508
Let's go, ref! This kid's not doing anything!

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.052
It's stalling!
Doing great, Stemler.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.595
Come on, Stemler!
Focus.

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:13.098
Keep it going!
Tough it out, buddy!

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.350
All right, Stemler.
Stalling, green.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.018
One, red.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.646
Just keep going.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:22.732
We're one point from a tech fall.
We're gonna lose on criteria.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.027
No shit. Really?
If he loses by 15 points it's a technical fall...

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.864
...and even though the score is tied,
we're gonna lose.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.615
Seriously?
All right, fuck this.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.284
Hey, Stemler. Stemler!

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:35.203
Listen to me. You need to get up, buddy!

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.747
All right? He is trying to drown you!

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.500
He wants you dead! Okay?

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:43.670
But you are not gonna die
on the bottom, are you, Stemler? Right?

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:47.048
You hear me?
All right, you remember the move?

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.551
Whatever the fuck it takes.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:54.306
Whatever the fuck it takes! Get up!
Come on, Stemler!

01:05:02.773 --> 01:05:05.066
Wrestle him! Wrestle him!

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:09.988
Let's go, Stemler!

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:12.908
Keep going, buddy!

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.499
Go shake his hand. Shake his hand!

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.586
Thank you very much.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.848
I'm proud of what you did today.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.225
That win meant a lot to the guys.

01:05:39.393 --> 01:05:42.687
Yeah. Good coaching with Stemler.
Yeah.

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:47.901
Let me ask you something, Kyle.
What's it like to be as good as you are?

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.569
What's that feel like?

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.321
I don't know.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.366
I guess it just feels like I'm in control.

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:56.534
Of everything, you know?

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:01.289
Yeah, I do. Must be nice.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:04.125
It is.

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:10.548
Get your leg free. Greg, get your leg free.
Gotta get your leg free. Arch your back!

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:14.469
Arch! Arch! Fight! Arch! Fight it!
Get your leg free!

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.472
Get your leg free! Arch! Up, up, reach!

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.307
Reach! Fight it!

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.810
District champs, baby.
Yep.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.229
Pure fucking poetry, baby!
District champs, baby.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.693
Hey, Leo.
Yeah.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.112
Guess who just won the districts.
Who?

01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:33.488
I did.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.615
Check it out.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.743
And guess what.
What?

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.538
Mike got a call
from a college scout about me.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.708
Yeah?
Hi, baby.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.836
What are you doing here?

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:52.424
I just came to get you, honey.
And to see Grandpa.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.720
Baby, I missed you so much.
Can I get a hug?

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.445
She go down?
Yeah, she passed right out.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:15.530
How's he doing?
He's upset.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.740
And I don't blame him.

01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:18.783
It's weird she shows up like that.
Yeah.

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:23.204
And of course she's late, the druggie.
Can you stop with the "druggie" thing?

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.373
Please.
What? She's a druggie.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:27.709
I understand that.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.503
You're gonna talk to her, right?
Yes, I intend to.

01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:31.796
If you don't punch her first.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.551
Okay, uh, that's her.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.430
It's not my fault if I punch her.
You know what? It is.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.557
That will be your fault.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.602
Mike Flaherty. How are you?

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.646
Come on in, please.
Sorry, but my cab was late, so...

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:51.441
That's not a problem.
Not a problem. Come in.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:52.942
This is my wife, Jackie.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.655
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Right.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.409
Can I take your jacket?

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:04.162
Oh, yeah. Yes.
Okay.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.331
Thank you. Ahem.

01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:12.670
You have a really nice home.
Thank you.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.673
Do you wanna sit down?

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.009
Thanks.
Please.

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:23.932
So Kyle's downstairs
with Abby, our 6-year-old.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.687
Can I get you a drink?

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.651
Uh, water or soda? Anything?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.737
Oh. No, I'm...

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:38.988
...fine.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:43.201
Okay, uh, I'll go get Kyle.

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:45.036
Yeah. How's he doing?

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:50.125
Uh, actually, he's doing very well.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.417
Extremely well.

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:56.506
Yes, he's going to the high school here.
And he's wrestling on the team, actually.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.343
Yeah, that's great. Mm.
Yeah.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.720
He loves wrestling so much.
I know.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.682
He's a sweet kid. Our girls love him.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.732
That's nice. I'm sorry.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:17.652
I don't mean to-

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:24.075
It's just been a really hard time
and everything.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:28.537
And I feel bad that-
Oh. Come on.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:31.082
Now, come on. These things happen.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.167
We loved having him here.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.961
It's okay.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.421
Hey, honey.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.675
This is Abby.
Abby, this is Kyle's mom.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:44.179
Hey, Abby.
Hi.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.680
Hey, kiddo, you think you could
go get Kyle for us?

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.559
He left.
He left? What do you mean?

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:51.269
He left out the window.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:57.859
I'm really sorry about this.
It's okay. Thanks.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.530
You know, Kyle is doing really well
with the wrestling here, Cindy.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:09.037
He has the regions this weekend, and if
he wins there, he goes on to the states.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.331
That's great.
It is, you know.

01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:13.583
Could be a really good thing for him.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.336
It might even mean a scholarship.
You know?

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:20.048
So I was wondering, actually, if you
wouldn't mind maybe staying around...

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.925
...another couple of weeks?

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:25.970
I don't think I can afford
to stay in the motel for that long.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:31.768
Do you think maybe
we could stay in my dad's house?

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:36.481
Yeah, I think that we could
probably make that work. Yeah.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.443
Yeah. Then, yeah.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:41.945
Really?
Yeah.

01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.405
That's great. Great.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.325
Sorry. Excuse me. Ahem.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.412
Yeah, Kyle's over here.
Really?

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.747
Good, we found him.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.667
Yeah, we're playing Wii Golf.
I'm destroying him.

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:59.170
Hey, not for nothing, dude,
but this kid really hates his mother.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.798
All right. Great, Terry. Thank you.
No, I'm serious.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:03.258
More than I hate my ex-wife.

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.426
Okay, I got it, Terry. Great. Thank you.

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:07.011
Bye.
All right.

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:09.931
He went to my friend's house,
we can get him there.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:14.519
Yeah, you know, I think, um,
I probably should just go back to the motel.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:17.146
It might be too much for him tonight.
You sure?

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:20.108
Yeah, I think it's probably better.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.527
I know how he can be.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.699
It's hard, pal, I know.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:32.328
But she's staying so you can finish the
season, that's pretty nice of her, you know?

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:35.665
I told her you'd go see her today.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.793
Where?
Oh, you know, wherever you want.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:42.213
Uh, you could see her here,
we could go see her at Leo's house.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.382
She's moving in this morning.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.802
All right.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:52.307
I'll go see her at Leo's before practice.
But I wanna go alone.

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:58.688
Hi, Mike.
Hi, Betty.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.566
How's the foot?
Fine.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.192
Good.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.908
Cindy's here.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:12.493
Really? Did she say why?

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.580
No, but she's here with an attorney.

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:19.042
Hey, Cindy. How you doing?
Hi.

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:20.585
Hi.
Hi. Mike Flaherty.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.378
Eleanor Cohen.
Great to meet you.

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:23.755
So nice to meet you.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:26.632
Well, I didn't realize Cindy
was represented by counsel.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.597
Yeah, she retained me last week to
help sort out the situation with her father.

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.934
Okay. Well, come on in.
Well, thank you.

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:38.144
Yeah.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:48.946
I thought, uh- I thought you said
you just got here two days ago, Cindy.

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:55.453
Uh, Cindy wanted a little time to settle in
and spend some time with her father.

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:59.791
Sure, yeah. Um, so how can I help?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.962
Cindy's decided to have
a more active role in her father's care.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.924
Mm-hm. Great. What kind of role is that?

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.594
I want to take care of him.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:13.054
Really?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.598
Do you wanna move here?
No.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:19.102
Cindy's decided to bring her father
back to Columbus.

01:13:19.978 --> 01:13:22.313
That's where my support network is now.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:23.481
It's home.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:30.822
My only concern is that
that may not be what Leo wants.

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:33.366
Yeah, I already talked to him about it.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.118
He seemed to like the idea.

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:38.788
I understand that, Cindy. But, uh...

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:42.250
...you know, you haven't
seen Leo in a long time...

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.128
...and he's battling dementia now.

01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:49.257
So it kind of puts me
in a tough position here, you know?

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.634
Yeah, I understand.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:56.973
But seeing that she is the presumed
guardian, we hope to avoid litigation.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:14:00.518
So do I. And I know that we can.
Absolutely.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.604
We definitely can.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:07.608
Now, I'm sorry,
but I actually have to see another client.

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:12.155
But we should set up another time
to talk about this, definitely, okay?

01:14:12.322 --> 01:14:13.781
Yes.

01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:15.867
Okay.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.504
Is it that bad?
Yeah, it's that bad.

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:30.840
Take her to court. You'll kill her.
I can't.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:34.010
What do you mean? She's a mess.
You're a pillar of the community.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:38.389
I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee.
It'll look very bad. Trust me.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:41.851
I can't afford that right now, Terry.
Well, then dump it.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.561
Dump it. Just give her back Leo.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.314
It sucks, but you got your business
to worry about.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.858
Yeah, I do. Maybe you're right.
Incoming, dude.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:51.235
Mike.
Hey, pal.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:55.323
Do you know she wants to take Leo back?
Yeah, I know. She just told me today.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.742
You're not gonna let her do that,
are you?

01:14:58.702 --> 01:15:00.495
I don't know, Kyle. It's complicated.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.163
What's complicated?

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.124
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You can't let her do that.

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:09.795
All right. Why don't you just go get ready
for practice, all right? I'll deal with it.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:12.757
Fine.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:16.010
But I told her I'm staying with you guys
until I leave.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.221
Stay focused, Kyle.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:25.269
What's your play?
Well, I have no fricking idea.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.731
She's looking for a payout, dude.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.942
Just give her an exit.
What does that mean?

01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:34.487
Give her some of Leo's money and
send her home. He's not gonna miss it.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:38.491
No, I can't do that.
She's not even in his-

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:44.121
That's right, she's not. And she
doesn't know it, and that's my play.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.082
Wait, what's your play?

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.505
Don't worry about it.
Can you get practice started?

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:56.259
Really? Yeah.
Good, go.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:59.136
Want me to slap you, get you psyched?
No, I really don't.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:03.474
I know that we're all concerned
with what's best for Leo...

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:06.769
...so I'm hoping that we can
settle this in an amicable way.

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.145
Well, so do we.
Good.

01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:13.317
Well, um, to that end, I thought that
I would lay all the cards on the table...

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:18.322
...so that maybe you can understand why
I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy.

01:16:18.865 --> 01:16:20.408
Okay.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:23.494
Okay.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:29.584
Cindy, your father disinherited you
from his will, completely.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:33.921
And I'm afraid that that can't change
now that he's been declared incapacitated.

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:37.008
What?

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.260
Is that true?

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.679
We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.932
Certainly. I brought you a copy.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.726
Thank you.
You bet.

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:49.562
Then who did he leave it to? Kyle?

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.689
No.
Then who? You?

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:52.898
No, no.

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.651
He actually left it
to the municipal parks system.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:58.112
He wanted the town park
dedicated in his name.

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:03.284
Oh, my God. He is such a scumbag.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.829
Okay.
Oh, my God. No.

01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:11.667
He never cared about a fucking thing except
himself and his goddamn fucking money!

01:17:11.835 --> 01:17:13.210
Cindy.
Oh, my God!

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:15.546
Don't do this.
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.548
Please.
"Please" what?

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:18.716
"Please"?

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.719
I need to discuss this with my client.
Understood.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.722
Discuss? I'm not taking care of him
if I'm not getting anything.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.223
That's it. No!
Stop it.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:29.185
Oh, my God.
Uh, we're finished here, Mike.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.812
Understand completely.
I'm gonna leave that with you.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.731
Thank you.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:37.693
How did you not know this?
Look. Calm down.

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.779
What the fuck were you doing?

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.746
Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:51.165
Yeah, and she's moved back to the motel.
Good.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.293
Yes, it is. I think it worked.
It totally worked.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:57.088
They opened their kimono
and you made them eat the trade.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:59.548
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:01.300
No, no, really.

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:13.688
It's time, coach.

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:18.109
Hey, you ready?

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.699
He's ready.

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:34.291
This is exciting, huh?
You think there are scouts here?

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:37.128
Definitely. Wait till we get to the states.
Atlantic City?

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.213
Oh. We're gonna have so much fun.
Fierce.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:40.965
Good luck, baby.

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.685
Lockup.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.604
Okay. Listen up, all right?

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:57.648
One more win and we go to the states.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.151
That's all that matters,
that's all that counts.

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:01.944
Hey! Listen to me.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.197
You stay in this, okay?

01:19:05.365 --> 01:19:09.618
This is your place.
This is your place, you control it.

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:11.829
Remember? You control it!

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:13.748
Now, go get him! Finish it!

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:17.626
At 119, we have Timmons,
New Providence...

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.670
...and Brown, Saddle Brook.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.428
Ready to go on the whistle, kid.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.680
Here we go.
Okay, we're ready.

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.640
Good game, gentlemen.

01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:34.018
Stance.
Come on, Kyle, you got this.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.063
Head up! Head up! Head up!

01:19:42.402 --> 01:19:44.779
Kyle!
That's a point, right?

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:47.406
Yo, what do you got?
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:50.201
Kyle! Control. Settle down.
One point, red.

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:54.538
Just settle down, okay?
Let's go, Chris!

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:05.341
Sprawl!
Sprawl, Kyle! Sprawl!

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:08.385
Foot's on the mat. On the mat.
On the mat.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.222
Settle down.

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:15.434
No, that's it. Over. Over.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.372
How you doing?

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:40.251
I'm sorry.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:46.757
Hey. It's all right, man. It's all right.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.103
I don't wanna go with her, Mike.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.272
I don't.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.943
Okay, pal.

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:09.280
Okay.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.798
Hey, buddy. Heads up.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.553
Take them to the car, would you?
I'll be right there.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:41.061
Why are you here?
I wanted to see my son wrestle.

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:46.150
Yeah, well, your son had a pretty good
chance to do something special in there.

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.027
Maybe even change his life.

01:21:48.194 --> 01:21:50.321
And that's gone now,
so I hope you're happy.

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:52.948
That's not my fault.
It isn't?

01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:56.076
Why do you think he lost his shit
in there today? Huh?

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:59.288
What do you want?
I want my father.

01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:02.833
It didn't sound like that the other day.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:06.003
You have no idea what my father
used to be like.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:07.963
He was different.

01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:12.009
He treated me like shit.
So you're gonna return the favor, is that it?

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.510
I want that commission!

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:15.888
That's mine!
Is that what this is about?

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.641
Fifteen hundred dollars? My God.

01:22:18.808 --> 01:22:20.351
Isn't that why you took him?

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.864
Okay. You know what, I'll tell you what.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:37.534
You want the commission?
Fine, I will let you have it.

01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:39.161
You don't even have to take Leo.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.247
I will take care of him for free,
and I will send you the check.

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:44.208
On one condition.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:48.045
What's that?
That you leave Kyle here with us...

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.214
...until he finishes high school.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.635
I'm his mother. He belongs with me.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.387
You sure he feels that way?

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:58.722
Don't you tell me what my son feels.

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:01.558
He's coming with me,
and there isn't anything you can do.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:03.394
Then you can't have that commission.

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:05.562
Oh, well, we'll see about that!

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:07.523
Yeah, we will.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.901
I want to see my son!

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:14.321
Give him a call. You got his number.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.580
We were right there, Mike.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:25.749
Right fucking there.

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.919
Now we got nothing.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.224
Are you okay?

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.769
No.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.274
Mike. Your mom's here.
Dinner's almost ready.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.443
You seen Kyle?
He's not in the basement?

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.278
No.
For chrissake.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:58.282
I'll find him.
Thanks, Terry.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.868
What a day, huh?
Yeah, right.

01:24:06.624 --> 01:24:07.666
You okay?

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:11.670
What are we gonna do?

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:16.300
There's nothing to do. I can't stop her.
She's gonna take Leo and Kyle with her.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.386
You don't think you can beat her in court?
No, I don't. Nope.

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:22.639
Well, isn't it obvious
she just wants him for the money?

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.394
I just can't win this one, Jack.

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.979
Trust me.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:31.732
I do.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.034
Hey, Kyle. Honey, come in.

01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:45.662
I'm so glad you came.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.250
Have a seat, honey.

01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:53.170
You want a soda or something?

01:24:53.546 --> 01:24:55.255
What do you want?
Ahem.

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:08.352
I just wanted to say
how sorry I was about the match.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:12.314
Is that why you called?
Just to tell me that?

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:15.484
No.

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:21.448
I also wanted to say that I'll do
whatever you think is best for Leo.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:23.200
I promise.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.327
Then leave him here, where he is.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:31.125
I have to tell you, I'm not sure
that's what Leo wants.

01:25:31.876 --> 01:25:33.377
Here.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.882
Just read the parts in yellow.
What is it?

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:41.510
It's the transcript
from when Leo was in court.

01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:43.846
My lawyer got it for me.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:47.850
This isn't real.

01:25:48.017 --> 01:25:50.686
The judge told Leo he had to live there.
No.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.980
No, honey. This is official from the court.

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.149
That's what Mike said.

01:25:56.276 --> 01:26:00.070
He gets paid
for being Leo's guardian, Kyle.

01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:04.366
And then he just put him in that place
so he wouldn't have to deal with him.

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.702
Leo belongs with us.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.162
Why?

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.001
Because we deserve that money, Kyle.
Not some lawyer.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:19.047
You're a big boy.
You can understand that.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.721
Look, Kyle, honey-

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:30.100
Shut up. Just shut up.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:33.103
I don't care about any of this.
Just leave Leo alone!

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.606
Do you hear me?

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.482
Do you?

01:26:43.656 --> 01:26:45.949
Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it.

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:47.367
Yeah, bye.

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:49.494
Anything?
No, he's not at Stemler's.

01:26:49.662 --> 01:26:51.205
Where could he be?
I don't know.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.707
Uh, maybe he went for a walk.
We should take a drive.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.125
Your mom can stay with the kids.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:59.254
Where we gonna go? Hold on. Yes?

01:26:59.422 --> 01:27:01.006
Hello?

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.634
Yeah, this is him.
Who is it?

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.637
What?

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.056
It has been a very long day.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.515
I need some answers.

01:27:10.683 --> 01:27:13.644
Now, if you can't give them to me,
get me somebody who can.

01:27:13.978 --> 01:27:15.562
Now.
Sir, please stay calm.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.731
We're doing our best.
You've lost my ward.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.358
Calm down.
We'll find him.

01:27:19.525 --> 01:27:21.443
"Calm down"?
We're gonna sue your ass.

01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:23.946
I'm sorry.
How could you just let him escape?

01:27:24.113 --> 01:27:26.698
Look, he's definitely
not on the premises.

01:27:26.866 --> 01:27:29.618
A lot of the time,
they just try to go home.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:33.705
We're about to go there now.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:36.833
Hey, folks,
keep an eye on each other.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:38.502
Terry.

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.928
The lights are on.
It's gotta be him.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.764
Hey, did you bring the key?
No, I forgot it.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.062
My bad, my bad, my bad.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:59.690
Ring the bell.
I just did, sweetheart, okay?

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:04.027
I think I hear a TV.
Really?

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:07.656
You're right. Okay.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.158
Hold on, hold on.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.370
Hold on.

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:20.836
Yes, there he is.
What's he doing?

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:22.296
He's watching TV.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.637
He's not responding. Hit the bell.

01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:33.724
Anything?
Nothing.

01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:36.560
Dude, is he dead?
I have no fricking idea.

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:39.187
Christ.
Dude, this is kind of spooky.

01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:40.772
Should we break in?
No.

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.692
Okay. I've got a key back at the office.
I'll go get it.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.652
You guys stay here.
Alone?

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.910
Come on in.

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.331
Super spooky.
You go first.

01:28:57.498 --> 01:29:00.083
Oh, for God's sake.
I'll go last.

01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:10.344
You okay, Leo?

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.639
How'd you get here, pal?

01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:17.768
Leo, did you walk here?

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:21.355
I brought him.
Aah!

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.192
You brought him?
Yeah.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.111
Are you out of your mind?
We've been worried sick about him.

01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:29.529
About both of you.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.157
You didn't have to worry about us.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.995
Really creepy. Just saying.

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:43.210
What the hell are you doing?
Making spaghetti.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:46.463
Jesus, have you lost your mind?
No.

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:50.008
You can't just take him out of the home.
This is where he belongs.

01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:53.220
No, honey, he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
We talked about this.

01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:55.389
Yeah, we did.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.265
I remember.

01:29:57.433 --> 01:29:59.184
Listen to this.

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:02.229
"Mr. Flaherty:
Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.315
Judge Lee: You can do that, Mike?

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:08.902
Mr. Flaherty: Yes, I can. Really."

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.946
What? What is this? What?

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:13.115
It's true, isn't it?

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:15.575
Mike?

01:30:16.994 --> 01:30:18.829
What is this?

01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:24.167
You're just like her.

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.253
Mike.

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:34.511
Hey, Kyle. Hey,
will you hold on a second?

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:35.971
Don't touch me!

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:40.434
I'm sorry, come on.
I said, don't touch me!

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.853
Jesus. Okay.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.564
Let me explain, okay?
Explain what?

01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:48.108
How you lied to me?
How you lied to Leo?

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:51.236
No, that's not how it was, okay?
Then how was it, Mike?

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:54.030
Calm down. All right? Come on, man.

01:30:54.198 --> 01:30:55.782
Calm down.
Watch the head fake.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.826
I'm not gonna wrestle with you.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.703
Hands up, hands up.
Stop it, okay?

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.413
Don't egg him on.
That's not helping.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.707
It is. This kid's a good wrestler.
Calm down.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:05.584
You see, I told you.
Stop it!

01:31:05.751 --> 01:31:08.879
Okay, buddy, get to your base. Good.
Stop!

01:31:09.046 --> 01:31:10.714
Mike, stop it!
Okay, buddy.

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:13.383
I'm trying to stop it!
Sit out, Mike!

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.886
Sit out!
Would you stop coaching and break it up?

01:31:16.053 --> 01:31:17.971
Ow. Get the hell off me!
Break it up!

01:31:19.515 --> 01:31:22.100
Come on, get up. It's okay.
I- No, no, no.

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:24.561
I'm just the ref. I'm just the ref!
Just the ref!

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:29.733
Come on!
Kyle!

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.198
Is this true, Mike?

01:31:36.365 --> 01:31:37.866
Did you say this to the judge?

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:41.578
Yeah, I did.

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:45.916
So then why did you move him
if he wanted to stay here?

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:50.837
Because it would have been
too much work to leave him here.

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.589
Okay? I couldn't handle it.

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:56.176
Then you shouldn't have taken him.
I had to do it, all right?

01:31:56.344 --> 01:32:00.597
Why?
Because I needed the money. Okay?

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.098
We need the money.

01:32:02.266 --> 01:32:06.019
So you took some old man
out of his home to make money off him?

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.939
What, are you out of your freaking mind?
No. No!

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:12.609
I did not think that it would
get this complicated, okay?

01:32:12.985 --> 01:32:16.905
Really? Or you just didn't think
you'd get caught?

01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:30.627
Jack, where you going?
Home!

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:46.768
Incoming call. Do you copy?

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:52.065
Incoming call. Charlie Squadron taking
heavy fire. Requesting air strike Bravo.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:54.609
Do you copy?

01:32:54.777 --> 01:32:57.612
Delta Squad, disengage target.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.659
Hello, Mom?

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:09.291
Did your mom just crank-call you?

01:33:09.792 --> 01:33:11.084
No.

01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:16.006
So did you and coach get into a fight
because you lost?

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:18.300
No, we got in a fight
because he's an asshole.

01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:22.345
Really?
Yeah, really, Stem.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:25.640
Well, I'm sure he'll
make it up to you, bro.

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:27.642
You're the best wrestler he's ever had.

01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:31.146
I mean, he's always been cool to me,
and I suck.

01:33:38.362 --> 01:33:41.031
Hi, Leo.
Hey.

01:33:42.199 --> 01:33:46.161
I fell asleep. Ahem. I'm sorry.

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:48.038
Sorry for what?

01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:56.796
Wanna go home, Leo?

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:01.885
Yes. I'd like that.

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.693
Where's Kyle?
He slept at Stemler's.

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:22.614
You?
Uh, Oak Knoll.

01:34:26.535 --> 01:34:28.370
So, what are you gonna do?

01:34:29.246 --> 01:34:30.872
I have to go to court.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.583
No, you can't. You told the judge
you were keeping Leo at home.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.293
I know.

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:38.296
Tell her you changed your mind
and he needs to be in a home.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:39.923
No one could argue with that.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:42.425
I can't do that.

01:34:43.594 --> 01:34:47.263
Why not?
Because it's not true.

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:50.684
Oh, well, I'm glad you're done lying now.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.854
Just in time to lose your practice.
That's how your family survives.

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:56.773
Did you ever think of that, Mike?

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.859
Yeah, all the time.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.784
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:10.203
I really am.

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:14.457
I know.

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.888
Hey, pal. How'd you get down here?

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:32.517
The window.
You hungry? I'm making pancakes.

01:35:32.685 --> 01:35:34.602
I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit.

01:35:34.770 --> 01:35:37.021
Right now?
Yeah.

01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:42.068
Hey, Kyle.

01:35:43.028 --> 01:35:44.738
Listen, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.741
I know, Mike, you're sorry.
Everyone's always sorry.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:52.328
I'm moving Leo back home, Kyle, and I'm
gonna fight to make sure that he stays there.

01:35:52.496 --> 01:35:55.707
It's too late, you'll lose.
My mother's gonna take him.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.752
Maybe, but I'm still gonna try.

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:02.338
So what? You want me to forgive you now,
is that it, Mike?

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:07.260
No, I just want you
to give me another chance.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.228
This is bullshit!

01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:22.525
Hey, Kyle, listen-
I want to be alone.

01:36:22.693 --> 01:36:26.488
What?
I just wanna be down here alone.

01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:29.991
Okay. All right. Yeah.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.624
Kyle, I just wanna say we love you.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:41.729
Hey, guys.
Hey.

01:37:41.897 --> 01:37:44.023
Hey, Mr. Poplar.
Good to see you.

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:45.233
Jackie.
Hey.

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:47.402
How's it going?
What are you doing here?

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.571
Dude, I'm your assistant coach.

01:37:49.738 --> 01:37:51.614
Just notice who isn't here.
Aha.

01:38:03.335 --> 01:38:05.378
Ah. Hey, Mike?

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:07.046
Hey, Eleanor.

01:38:07.339 --> 01:38:08.590
Can I talk to you?

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:12.719
Sure. Hold on, okay?

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:22.770
You know the transcript alone
is enough to hang you.

01:38:22.938 --> 01:38:25.899
Yeah, well, we'll see what happens.

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:29.736
Shame on you, counselor.

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.116
Is that it?

01:38:36.285 --> 01:38:38.661
No, my client would like to talk to you.

01:38:52.927 --> 01:38:54.844
Is your deal still available?

01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:58.598
What about Kyle?

01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:02.518
He can stay.

01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:06.856
Then, yes, it is.

01:39:07.733 --> 01:39:09.150
And you'll send me the checks?

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.694
Every month.

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.823
You take good care of him?

01:39:16.533 --> 01:39:18.326
We will.

01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:21.829
I wanna say goodbye.

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:24.791
Okay.

01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:28.753
Kyle, come here for a minute.

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:34.717
Your mom wants to talk to you
for a minute.

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.334
Nice shot.
Thanks.

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:10.753
Not bad, not bad.
Check this out.

01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:12.422
All right.

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.093
Nice, dude.
This mallet's crap.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.059
Hey, guys.

01:40:25.227 --> 01:40:27.103
Hi, Daddy. I'm winning.
That's great.

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:28.646
What up, coach?
Hey, Stemler.

01:40:28.814 --> 01:40:31.357
Kyle, can you move those
garbage cans around the side?

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:32.942
All right.
Thanks, pal.

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:35.111
All right, I'm switching colors.
Why?

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:36.696
I'm not feeling the orange.

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.948
Hey, honey.
Hey. How was work?

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:42.952
Good. I got stuck at the office with a client.
I know, Shelly called.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.080
I dropped off the fan at Leo's today.
Thanks for doing that.

01:40:46.248 --> 01:40:48.458
I'll be right back down.
You got time to eat?

01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:51.627
Uh, I'll eat there.
All right, make sure you do.

01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:07.852
Hey, barkeep.
I will take a banana daiquiri, please.

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:11.064
All right.
Would you like an umbrella with that?

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.316
No, thank you, but keep those coming.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.946
So how you doing, pal?
Me?

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.115
I'm pretty good.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:38.257
I was driftin', cryin'

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:34.171
