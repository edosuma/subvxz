00:01.117 --> 00:03.017
What do you imagine
that there is left to say?

00:03.119 --> 00:04.086
- Everything.
- Or nothing.

00:04.186 --> 00:05.448
<i>Previously on Scandal...</i>

00:05.554 --> 00:07.385
Something happened
between you and Olivia,

00:07.490 --> 00:09.424
and something happened
between you and Amanda Tanner.

00:09.525 --> 00:11.016
I need to know
how much trouble we're in.

00:11.194 --> 00:13.355
Her name's Amanda, right?
She tried to kill herself?

00:13.463 --> 00:15.761
Gideon, which news outlet
do you work for?

00:15.866 --> 00:18.027
It's two sentences
about a disturbed girl!

00:18.135 --> 00:20.569
Watergate was two sentences
about a burglary!

00:20.671 --> 00:22.605
You know I was telling the truth
about the President.

00:22.806 --> 00:24.933
I can help you, if you let me.

00:25.075 --> 00:26.042
Hello?

00:26.143 --> 00:27.872
- Quinn, who's this?
- The reporter from the hospital.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.640
You don't have a story. So go home.

00:29.747 --> 00:32.910
She tried to kill herself the day
after she quit working for the President,

00:33.017 --> 00:33.984
and you're Olivia Pope.

00:34.085 --> 00:35.916
So, no, I didn't have a story.
But now...

00:36.020 --> 00:36.987
Now I do.

00:43.728 --> 00:46.698
Don't know how you take it,
cream or sugar, so I brought both.

00:46.799 --> 00:48.892
I don't take it. Do they always do this?

00:50.336 --> 00:53.169
- Yeah. They do that.
Good.

00:53.272 --> 00:54.864
God, I was starting to think
it was me or something.

00:54.973 --> 00:57.373
It is you.
They're talking about you, Amanda.

00:59.078 --> 01:00.875
Everyone's gonna be talking about you.

01:01.146 --> 01:02.340
No. No way.
Are you kidding?

01:02.481 --> 01:03.448
What if she's lying?

01:03.549 --> 01:05.040
- What if she's not? I vote yes.
- We're not voting.

01:05.150 --> 01:06.675
It's Monica all over again,
without the blue dress.

01:06.786 --> 01:08.048
- Without any kind of proof.
Who needs proof?

01:08.154 --> 01:09.212
The girl said
she slept with the President!

01:09.322 --> 01:10.482
Liv worked at the White House.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.114
That alone
makes it a giant conflict of interest.

01:12.225 --> 01:13.385
Oh, please, call me when
you grow a pair.

01:13.493 --> 01:15.427
- We're not voting!
She seems scared.

01:15.829 --> 01:17.490
I'd vote yes, if we were voting.

01:17.597 --> 01:18.564
It's Sandra Harding.

01:18.798 --> 01:21.596
Her son didn't make it to court, day one.
Can you believe it?

01:23.270 --> 01:24.532
- Who are we voting on?
- We're not voting.

01:24.638 --> 01:26.105
She's ours, we're keeping her. It's done.

01:26.574 --> 01:28.041
Sandra, we'll find him.

01:28.142 --> 01:29.336
I'll go to court. Help the defense stall.

01:29.443 --> 01:31.707
You're gonna have to get creative.
Harrison, you're with me.

01:31.812 --> 01:33.905
<i>Huck, find Gideon Wallace
at The D, C, Sun,</i>

01:34.014 --> 01:35.106
I wanna talk to him today.

01:35.216 --> 01:37.684
Abby, take Amanda home,
pack up her things, make sure...

01:37.785 --> 01:40.914
No one is following her and
set her up at your apartment. Got it.

01:46.361 --> 01:49.159
I'm losing my patience, Mr. Cole.

01:49.264 --> 01:51.129
I'm told he'll be here very soon,
Your Honor.

01:51.233 --> 01:54.100
A presidential motorcade
is blocking Massachusetts Avenue.

01:54.202 --> 01:55.533
Yet here we are.

01:55.637 --> 01:59.039
Perhaps the defendant should take
one of his helicopters, Your Honor.

02:03.780 --> 02:04.838
Running out of time, Liv.

02:05.715 --> 02:07.683
Well, keep stalling.

02:11.487 --> 02:13.717
Room service.
We've got your breakfast.

02:13.823 --> 02:15.518
I don't think we ordered any.

02:16.859 --> 02:17.849
I love my job.

02:17.961 --> 02:19.792
You might want to
put on some clothes for this.

02:19.897 --> 02:21.159
Excuse me.

02:23.634 --> 02:25.431
Up and at 'em, Trav!

02:26.603 --> 02:30.061
Whoa!
Livvie! How the hell are you?

02:30.174 --> 02:31.937
I'm fine. You're late.

02:32.042 --> 02:35.342
Hey, do you know who this is?
This is the Olivia Pope!

02:35.447 --> 02:37.574
She's amazing, she works for the...

02:38.383 --> 02:41.409
Who do you work for now?
White House? CIA? FBI?

02:41.519 --> 02:42.577
Today, your mother.

02:43.154 --> 02:44.178
Oh, crap!

02:44.289 --> 02:45.415
She's not too thrilled

02:45.523 --> 02:48.458
about the fact that you're late for court,
your first day of trial.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.557
Is this what you're looking for?

02:50.662 --> 02:52.755
Just give me, like, two minutes,
all right? Where are my pants?

02:52.864 --> 02:54.799
Why don't we rinse the booze off first?

02:54.900 --> 02:55.867
Judge will appreciate that?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.827
I know I've been
hitting it pretty hard lately, going out.

02:58.938 --> 03:00.371
I've just been so stressed out.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.236
A rape charge does it to the best of us.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.868
I didn't do it. I...

03:05.978 --> 03:07.309
No, I know. I believe you.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.438
Now let's go work on
that judge and jury.

03:14.488 --> 03:15.455
You.

03:19.459 --> 03:20.756
May I ask a favor?

03:22.462 --> 03:23.827
Court's adjourned!

03:23.930 --> 03:28.663
Back here at 2:00 with your defendant,
or I'll lock him up for the rest of the trial.

03:28.768 --> 03:29.997
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.770
How you holding up, Sandra?

03:36.544 --> 03:39.707
I can't lose him, Stephen.
I won't lose him.

03:39.814 --> 03:42.339
I know. I know.

03:47.188 --> 03:48.383
Get my good side, gentlemen.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.366 --> 03:59.493
Is there anything
you didn't take care of, Liv?

03:59.601 --> 04:02.035
Your hotel bill. It's a doozy.

04:09.535 --> 04:12.912
<i>sync and corrections by majtjkong</i>

04:16.286 --> 04:17.844
He really did forget
what time the trial starts.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.385
- Sandra.
- You're right. He screwed up.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.720
He's lucky the judge
didn't throw him back in jail.

04:22.825 --> 04:25.056
This isn't a parking ticket.
He's on trial for rape.

04:25.162 --> 04:27.960
- He didn't do it. He didn't rape that girl.
- I believe you.

04:28.065 --> 04:31.159
But if I'm the jury, I'm already
resenting him for wasting my time.

04:31.268 --> 04:33.168
Which is why
I would like you on this thing.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.966
You can guide our defense team.
Keep Travis in line.

04:36.073 --> 04:38.507
- Uh-uh. No way. Today was just a favor.
- Liv.

04:39.143 --> 04:42.341
Sandra, I love you. I love your son,

04:42.447 --> 04:44.574
but I'm on retainer for your company,
not your family.

04:44.683 --> 04:47.982
I help with mergers and PR.
I don't babysit 27-year-olds.

04:48.086 --> 04:51.817
I know that Travis is irresponsible.
I know that.

04:51.923 --> 04:56.155
I tried to tell him that he has to step up,
fix his own mistakes.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.058
Part of it is on me.

04:58.163 --> 05:00.189
After Hal died,
he went through a very rough time,

05:00.299 --> 05:04.292
and I didn't always have the time
to help him sort through all of that stuff.

05:04.403 --> 05:06.997
And these girls see
the son of a rich CEO

05:07.106 --> 05:09.131
and they get dollar signs in their eyes.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.642
That girl is not the victim here.
Travis is.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.339
Please.
You've handled difficult clients before.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.245
Not ones who didn't show up in court.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.343
And I already got Travis one of the best
defense lawyers in Washington.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.183
- He doesn't need me.
- I need you.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.520
I spend all day listening to people who
tell me what they think I wanna hear.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.562
You are the only one
who will give it to me straight.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.324
He could be in a lot of trouble here, Liv.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.564
I need someone on our side
who I can trust.

05:37.305 --> 05:39.899
People don't say no to you very often,
do they?

05:40.808 --> 05:43.470
Probably about as often
as they say no to you.

05:52.153 --> 05:55.214
- What's happening?
- Morning, honey.

05:55.858 --> 05:57.689
What's happening?

05:57.793 --> 06:00.353
I called Mrs. Hanley
and I canceled your morning schedule.

06:01.296 --> 06:02.490
For the love of God!

06:02.598 --> 06:04.998
You haven't been sleeping.
You paced until 4:00 a. m.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.067
I wanted you to get some sleep.

06:06.168 --> 06:08.363
I had a video conference
on "Hunger in the Developing World. "

06:08.470 --> 06:11.667
Mandela got out of bed.
Mandela was waiting for me.

06:11.774 --> 06:13.436
People die
if they don't get enough sleep.

06:13.543 --> 06:14.976
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
and I had a meeting.

06:15.111 --> 06:16.976
I was sitting
with the economic advisors.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.411
You needed one chance to sleep in.

06:18.581 --> 06:21.550
I'm the leader of the free world!
I do not sleep in!

06:23.053 --> 06:24.611
Why aren't you sleeping?

06:27.323 --> 06:28.347
Mel.

06:34.965 --> 06:38.492
I just want you to have what you need.
You know that.

06:45.976 --> 06:49.037
I'm doing a tour of
D.C. Homeless shelters this afternoon.

06:49.147 --> 06:52.344
I have to give a speech. Wish me luck.

06:58.123 --> 06:59.385
Hey!

07:00.225 --> 07:03.126
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

07:03.228 --> 07:05.253
You have to stop showing up here.

07:05.363 --> 07:08.458
- Are you always this high-strung?
- No, I'm just new.

07:08.601 --> 07:11.092
It's kind of charming. Relax.
I have a meeting with your boss.

07:11.204 --> 07:12.466
Um, Olivia...

07:12.572 --> 07:13.664
Hey, where are you going?
We have a meeting.

07:13.773 --> 07:14.865
No, we don't.

07:14.974 --> 07:17.636
You called me. Your guy said that
you wanted to talk to me about...

07:17.744 --> 07:19.234
- Why would I want to do that?
- I don't know.

07:19.345 --> 07:21.813
I imagine so you can try
to kill my story about Amanda Tanner.

07:21.914 --> 07:24.542
Which there is no way in hell
I'm gonna let you do.

07:24.650 --> 07:27.449
I don't have to kill your story, Gideon.
You're going to kill it yourself.

07:27.821 --> 07:31.450
As soon as you publish even anything
remotely interesting about my client,

07:31.558 --> 07:33.389
all of the real reporters at your paper

07:33.494 --> 07:35.985
are going to snatch it
right out of your cub reporter hands.

07:36.463 --> 07:39.398
By the way, great piece yesterday

07:39.500 --> 07:44.131
about how the cherry blossoms
are so late to bloom this year.

07:44.239 --> 07:46.230
I do hope they come soon.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.766
This is how this works.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.401
You're going to leave Amanda alone

07:50.512 --> 07:53.504
and keep her name out of your paper
for the next 72 hours.

07:53.615 --> 07:56.914
You do that, and I will give you
some background on her.

07:57.318 --> 07:59.218
And if you're lucky, a quote.

08:00.555 --> 08:02.581
Sounds fair. Okay, good meeting.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.022
There was no meeting.

08:07.897 --> 08:09.421
You bring a lot of clients to your home?

08:09.532 --> 08:12.558
Just the ones that need to be
kept out of the public eye.

08:13.402 --> 08:17.304
So what happens next?

08:17.406 --> 08:20.706
- Next, we talk about things.
- Okay.

08:20.844 --> 08:23.779
Not bad things.
Just things that will help me.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.144
For instance,
I need to know if you have any proof

08:26.349 --> 08:28.078
of what went on
with you and the President.

08:28.451 --> 08:29.475
Why do you need that?

08:29.586 --> 08:31.679
Because if it ever came down
to his word against yours,

08:31.788 --> 08:33.688
we'll need proof of what happened.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.020
Because even though I believe you,
others won't.

08:38.763 --> 08:42.198
I have something, yeah.
I'm not ready to tell you what it is.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.267
Amanda.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.892
My terms.
You said we could do this on my terms.

08:46.003 --> 08:49.234
- I'm not telling you until I'm ready.
- Okay.

08:50.942 --> 08:55.607
Hopefully it won't come to that.
Hopefully we'll figure this out.

08:55.714 --> 08:58.581
Which brings me
to the second thing I need.

08:58.684 --> 08:59.651
What's the end game?

09:00.185 --> 09:02.346
- The end game?
- A question I ask every client.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.445
What they want.
What's your best outcome?

09:04.556 --> 09:05.921
Do you want money?
Do you want to stay in Washington?

09:06.024 --> 09:07.992
Do you want your job back?
You have options.

09:10.662 --> 09:11.788
I want to see the President.

09:11.897 --> 09:14.162
- Excuse me?
- I want to see the President.

09:14.267 --> 09:19.330
I want one meeting with him,
alone, face-to-face.

09:23.643 --> 09:27.477
No. No, it was a caucus.
We were in Des Moines debating.

09:27.580 --> 09:30.640
And the moderator raises the question.
And Fitz just...

09:31.819 --> 09:32.786
Olivia.

09:32.953 --> 09:36.650
Oh, please.
Billy, can you give us a minute?

09:37.658 --> 09:38.625
Um...

09:38.759 --> 09:41.023
I'm eating shrimp scampi, so, no.

09:41.128 --> 09:42.095
Billy.

09:42.196 --> 09:45.097
Liv, I'm eating, and he's paying.
Do you know how rare that is?

09:45.199 --> 09:46.359
Look, you used to be the work wife,

09:46.467 --> 09:48.230
but word on the street
is your spot's open.

09:48.335 --> 09:50.668
- You really think I'm leaving this table?
- Billy, leave the table.

09:50.772 --> 09:51.864
Billy, leave the table.

09:58.847 --> 10:00.872
"Work wife. " I suppose that's true.

10:01.416 --> 10:03.213
Is true. Was true.

10:03.919 --> 10:05.250
He's not sleeping.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.853
Not my problem.

10:06.955 --> 10:09.720
So what does my ex-work wife want?

10:10.459 --> 10:13.587
Amanda Tanner wants a sit-down.
Fifteen minutes with him.

10:15.064 --> 10:18.056
- You and I both know...
- And then she goes away. For good.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.724
This is legit, Cyrus.

10:20.403 --> 10:24.362
- And then this goes away?
- Then you'll buy scampi only for me.

10:24.473 --> 10:27.875
- We made a President together.
- We did.

10:28.612 --> 10:29.977
I miss you.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.143
Yeah. Me, too.

10:34.618 --> 10:35.585
He's not sleeping.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.410
Cyrus, neither am I.

10:47.398 --> 10:49.093
<i>The woman's name is Helen Fisher,</i>

10:49.200 --> 10:51.760
<i>She went home with Travis willingly,</i>

10:51.936 --> 10:55.030
claims that things got out of hand,
he wouldn't take no for an answer.

10:55.139 --> 10:56.572
How are you explaining the bruises?

10:56.674 --> 11:00.303
Self-inflicted. After the fact.
Travis is innocent.

11:00.411 --> 11:01.400
Aren't they all?

11:01.947 --> 11:04.006
Hell, no. But Travis is.

11:04.783 --> 11:08.810
I have tried millions of these cases.
It's a classic "he said, she said. "

11:09.288 --> 11:12.746
- It'll all come down to...
- Perception. These cases always do.

11:12.858 --> 11:14.189
And you're, how do I say this,

11:14.293 --> 11:17.353
you're being perceived by the public,
and more importantly, by the jury,

11:17.463 --> 11:19.988
as an entitled rich-boy who thinks
he can get away with anything.

11:20.233 --> 11:22.565
To change that, you play by my rules.

11:22.669 --> 11:25.433
Harrison's your babysitter.
You do not drink. You don't go out.

11:25.538 --> 11:28.507
No more blondes,
as charming as she was.

11:28.975 --> 11:30.340
Whatever you say, Liv.

11:41.622 --> 11:43.817
You're obsessed.
Do I need a restraining order?

11:43.924 --> 11:46.518
Restraining order?
For a friend who brings you free coffee?

11:46.627 --> 11:48.595
We're not friends.
And that coffee is not free.

11:48.696 --> 11:49.754
What do you want?

11:49.864 --> 11:52.196
Jane Powell. She's prosecuting
the Harding rape case. You got any...

11:52.299 --> 11:55.268
Dirt? Dirt on Jane Powell?
My friend and colleague?

11:55.369 --> 11:56.803
So you can threaten or intimidate her?

11:56.905 --> 11:59.430
Oh, please. You hate Jane Powell.
Jane Powell is gunning for your job.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.908
- You're so touchy pre-coffee.
- Beat it, stalker.

12:03.011 --> 12:06.139
- That's no way to treat a friend.
- We're not friends!

12:07.082 --> 12:09.676
No luck with the U.S. Attorney,
I got nothing on the prosecution.

12:09.785 --> 12:10.911
Where's the jury?

12:11.019 --> 12:12.987
Uh, these 10 are voting guilty.

12:13.088 --> 12:14.886
But the trial's not even over.
How can you say that for sure?

12:14.991 --> 12:18.358
Demographics. Body language.
Sociological and psychological factors.

12:18.461 --> 12:21.658
I've ruled out all but two
as potential non-guilty votes.

12:21.764 --> 12:22.924
Juror four,

12:23.032 --> 12:25.830
<i>freelance graphic designer, bartender,
Voted for Nader,</i>

12:26.335 --> 12:28.394
He's independent. Contrarian. Good.

12:28.504 --> 12:29.903
And juror six.

12:30.306 --> 12:31.933
<i>NRA member, retired Marine,</i>

12:32.041 --> 12:33.976
<i>winces every time
the prosecution speaks,</i>

12:34.244 --> 12:36.576
So he's an alpha-male with a grudge
against the female prosecutor?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.671
Great. Love it. Huck, what'd you get?

12:39.683 --> 12:41.310
I can't discuss it! That's final.

12:41.452 --> 12:44.353
When the guy's in jail,
you can ask me anything you want.

12:48.525 --> 12:50.994
No, man. He is a total date-raper.

12:54.032 --> 12:55.329
Jury's set to hang him high.

12:56.701 --> 13:00.694
Day three of trial
and we've lost them already.

13:02.674 --> 13:03.663
Abby, what do we have on Helen?

13:03.942 --> 13:05.000
<i>I went to her work,</i>

13:05.110 --> 13:08.045
Thursdays at Tony's.
Two-for-one hi-balls.

13:08.146 --> 13:10.547
Helen and I had
a long standing weekly drinks date.

13:10.649 --> 13:14.449
I know the drill. I used to be so
hung over on Fridays during law school.

13:15.121 --> 13:16.281
It wasn't like that.

13:16.388 --> 13:18.413
Helen would have one,
maybe two drinks.

13:18.524 --> 13:21.015
She never wanted to be hung over
around the kids.

13:21.193 --> 13:25.323
Plus, working here, for a non-profit?
It's all she could afford. Excuse me.

13:26.532 --> 13:29.297
The bad? Helen's a saint.

13:29.603 --> 13:30.570
Special Ed advocate.

13:30.670 --> 13:33.730
Head of the American University
alumni club for D.C. A saint.

13:34.141 --> 13:36.507
Which I might add, you have to be
to win a "he said, she said" case

13:36.610 --> 13:39.443
without coming out looking like
a regretful slut who was asking for it.

13:39.579 --> 13:41.046
You're killing me. What's the good?

13:41.148 --> 13:43.912
The good is she's broke.
I checked her credit reports.

13:44.484 --> 13:47.682
She owes over 250 grand
between student loans and credit cards,

13:47.788 --> 13:50.018
and financially, the girl's drowning.

13:51.759 --> 13:54.250
You want me to settle?
Olivia, that's out of the question.

13:54.629 --> 13:56.028
Helen is an airtight witness.

13:56.130 --> 13:58.826
We need to stop her from cooperating
with the prosecution any further.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.662
And we've already lost the jury.

14:00.768 --> 14:02.999
He is innocent.
The evidence is paper-thin.

14:03.105 --> 14:06.802
Photographs of bruises on a pretty girl
prove to be very effective.

14:07.109 --> 14:11.045
In a case like this, perception is
more important than evidence.

14:11.146 --> 14:14.707
The truth doesn't matter.
He looks guilty, he is guilty.

14:14.816 --> 14:17.785
- We'll win on appeal.
- That will take two years, minimum.

14:17.886 --> 14:20.184
In the meantime,
Travis will be in prison.

14:20.989 --> 14:22.355
We've got an opportunity here.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.621
The girl needs money.
You have a lot of money.

14:25.728 --> 14:28.788
You only have one son. Settle.

14:33.269 --> 14:34.861
Do whatever you have to do.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.238
That's eight million
in three installments.

14:41.345 --> 14:42.607
In a way which makes it clear,

14:42.713 --> 14:46.114
the attorney representing Mr. Harding
was totally unaware.

14:46.217 --> 14:48.845
The gag order and
confidentiality clause are standard.

14:48.953 --> 14:50.511
As Charles here
has hopefully explained,

14:50.621 --> 14:53.112
it means
you stop cooperating as a witness.

14:53.490 --> 14:56.891
I'm not here. I was in the building,
on another case. I just...

14:56.994 --> 15:00.158
Which will force the prosecution
to drop the case.

15:00.298 --> 15:02.232
They've offered to throw in
an extra 500,000

15:02.334 --> 15:04.768
to the special education charity
of your choice,

15:04.869 --> 15:06.962
if we leave here with an agreement.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.233
- Ten.
- Ten? That is preposterous!

15:09.341 --> 15:11.866
You must... I'm sorry. Ignore me.
I'm not here.

15:12.277 --> 15:14.245
Ten. Up front. One payment.

15:14.412 --> 15:16.176
I can sell nine. No more.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.775
- Done.
- No.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.978
Helen, we're not going to get
a better offer...

15:22.088 --> 15:23.453
I said no.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.922
You're angry, Helen. I understand that.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.789
But the quickest way to put this
behind you is to settle this now,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.222
or you're looking at years of appeals.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.589
Years of unfinished anger...

15:32.698 --> 15:34.997
- How much would you take, Ms. Pope?
- I'm sorry?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.935
If you were me, how much
would it take you to be able to forget?

15:39.072 --> 15:42.235
To forget you'd been strangled,
had your clothes ripped off?

15:42.342 --> 15:45.004
Had some guy pin you down while
he forced his fist inside your mouth,

15:45.112 --> 15:47.842
so hard you could taste
your own blood?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.109
How much would it take you
to be able to forget all that?

15:51.285 --> 15:53.516
To be able to even think of
having sex with somebody again.

15:54.922 --> 15:57.083
To wake up every morning
and not want to kill yourself

15:57.191 --> 15:59.659
when you realize it wasn't just a dream,
it actually...

16:01.296 --> 16:06.256
How much would it take you
to forget all that? Ten million? Twenty?

16:07.702 --> 16:08.930
How much would you be worth?

16:10.406 --> 16:11.373
Hmm?

16:13.342 --> 16:14.673
How much?

16:23.319 --> 16:24.843
Let's go.

16:39.035 --> 16:40.002
Thank you for your service.

16:40.103 --> 16:41.627
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

16:42.706 --> 16:43.764
Thank you for your service.

16:44.407 --> 16:45.806
It's an honor, Mr. President.

16:46.777 --> 16:49.245
Gentlemen, thank you all.

16:50.047 --> 16:51.014
Thank you, sir.

16:51.415 --> 16:53.679
Sarge, thank you.

16:56.554 --> 16:57.612
Did you see that?

16:57.755 --> 16:58.722
Hmm?

16:59.156 --> 17:00.987
They had prosthetic hands.

17:01.092 --> 17:02.787
That man saluted me with his left hand

17:02.893 --> 17:05.089
because his right hand
was blown off by an IED,

17:05.196 --> 17:07.097
while he was busy keeping us safe.

17:07.665 --> 17:10.031
This country, its heart.

17:10.301 --> 17:13.567
I wish you were a cynic.
Being President is easier for a cynic.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.607
Olivia wants a meeting.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.906
One sit-down with Amanda Tanner
and it all goes away.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.941
I think... I think it's worth it.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.882
We do it casually, discreet,
somewhere off the grounds.

17:26.986 --> 17:29.750
You hear her out and then it's done.
We're free.

17:31.023 --> 17:32.991
This is a chance
to put Amanda Tanner behind you.

17:33.092 --> 17:34.081
Olivia will be there?

17:37.430 --> 17:42.300
Like I said, your life would be
so much easier if you were a cynic.

17:51.879 --> 17:53.039
Three days out.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.138
We let this go to jury
and we're screwed.

17:55.249 --> 17:57.444
Well, it's going to
because she won't settle.

17:57.551 --> 17:59.645
So we lost?

17:59.754 --> 18:03.690
I mean, what happens when we lose?
We're just done?

18:06.694 --> 18:08.719
We're never done.

18:09.831 --> 18:12.356
If we lose this round,
we prep him for appeal.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.560
And if we lose that,
we prep him for a second appeal.

18:14.669 --> 18:17.639
Because whatever happens,
there is always another move.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.004
Whatever happens, we do not give up.

18:20.109 --> 18:25.479
It is my name on that door,
and I do not give up.

18:30.085 --> 18:31.484
It's not personal.

18:32.254 --> 18:34.279
She really doesn't like the word "lose. "

18:39.763 --> 18:40.855
It feels kind of cheap.

18:40.964 --> 18:44.195
It is. Juries have a natural bias
against the exceedingly rich.

18:44.301 --> 18:47.600
Well, I have a natural bias
against rayon.

18:47.704 --> 18:50.696
But hey, if it'll help me
look as innocent as I am, I love it.

18:53.878 --> 18:55.539
Hey, man, be straight with me.

18:56.581 --> 18:58.879
What's the point of all this?

18:58.983 --> 19:02.714
I mean, if she won't settle,
I'm going to prison, aren't I?

19:06.724 --> 19:08.316
No more yellow ties.

19:09.494 --> 19:12.396
Blue. You can trust a man in blue.

19:16.935 --> 19:21.201
But maybe we didn't go high enough.
Maybe we should try again.

19:21.306 --> 19:23.570
I mean,
they always take the money in the end.

19:28.213 --> 19:29.875
Okay, I can't talk.

19:30.517 --> 19:33.008
Not now. You have to stop calling me!

19:33.119 --> 19:34.848
Who were you talking to?

19:34.954 --> 19:37.616
<i>That reporter from The Sun,
He keeps calling me.</i>

19:38.658 --> 19:40.990
Look, I'm not going to take
your phone away.

19:41.194 --> 19:44.186
But I cannot stress the importance
that you only take calls

19:44.297 --> 19:46.060
from your parents and my staff.

19:46.165 --> 19:48.930
You cannot answer your phone.
Not even to tell someone to go away.

19:49.470 --> 19:51.665
Damn it! He knows something.
He's chomping at the bit.

19:51.772 --> 19:53.501
- He must have something.
- He likes me.

19:54.174 --> 19:55.436
- What?
- The reporter.

19:55.910 --> 19:58.401
Gideon. I think he likes me.
Maybe I could talk to him.

19:58.512 --> 19:59.672
Find out what he knows.

20:02.716 --> 20:03.705
Harrison.

20:03.817 --> 20:05.547
I want permission
to look into Travis's finances.

20:05.754 --> 20:06.721
What are you thinking?

20:06.821 --> 20:08.982
He said something about settlements.
How they always take the money.

20:09.090 --> 20:11.991
I think we should know
if he's speaking from experience.

20:12.794 --> 20:13.783
Be careful.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.801
In '08,
he made three payments of $200,000

20:21.903 --> 20:22.892
to a young woman in Arlington.

20:23.038 --> 20:24.131
Her name's Rachel Kline,

20:24.240 --> 20:26.572
23-year-old waitress
at Darcy's in Georgetown.

20:26.676 --> 20:28.735
Let's track her down,
find out what the money was for.

20:28.844 --> 20:29.811
Can't. She's dead.

20:29.912 --> 20:31.504
Committed suicide three years ago.
Pills.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.145
600 grand's a hell of a tip
for your favorite waitress, hmm?

20:34.250 --> 20:35.478
All the marks of a cover-up here.

20:36.852 --> 20:37.841
Covering up what?

20:37.954 --> 20:39.717
Liv, I know Sandra's your friend, but...

20:39.822 --> 20:41.016
If he raped that girl and paid her off,

20:41.123 --> 20:43.786
it makes it a lot more likely
he raped Helen, too.

20:52.536 --> 20:54.470
Looks like we're going
to get 458 passed in the Senate.

20:54.571 --> 20:57.836
Nice victory for bipartisanship. What?

20:59.944 --> 21:02.344
I thought we were good.
Problem solved.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.710
But this just came in my mail.
My personal mail.

21:04.949 --> 21:07.213
- What is it?
- It's an audio tape.

21:07.318 --> 21:10.583
Do they call them "audio tapes" now,
what with CDs and all? I'm old.

21:10.688 --> 21:12.918
Cyrus, you're rambling.
You don't ramble. So now I'm nervous.

21:13.424 --> 21:14.686
Listen, you'll wanna hear this.

21:44.758 --> 21:45.725
Cy...

21:45.825 --> 21:47.793
From that first day, when you
asked me to run your campaign,

21:47.894 --> 21:49.828
I dreamed a lot of dreams. Big dreams.

21:49.929 --> 21:51.726
I knew you were going to be President,
but...

21:54.435 --> 21:56.733
I never dreamed
I'd be listening to a tape of you

21:57.438 --> 21:59.702
moaning with a White House aide.

22:01.008 --> 22:02.305
That's what that is, right?

22:02.410 --> 22:05.777
You with your pants down,
having sex with Amanda Tanner?

22:05.880 --> 22:06.869
Cyrus...

22:07.048 --> 22:10.916
You don't talk. You don't talk anymore.

22:11.018 --> 22:15.615
Someone sent this to me. You get that?
Amanda Tanner is blackmailing you.

22:15.724 --> 22:18.955
Which means that
Olivia Pope is blackmailing you.

22:25.033 --> 22:29.470
This isn't Liv. Liv didn't do this.
She wouldn't do this.

22:29.571 --> 22:30.561
Mr. President...

22:30.673 --> 22:33.164
- Liv wouldn't do this.
- I don't want to believe it either, but...

22:33.276 --> 22:35.836
Liv is not behind this.

22:35.945 --> 22:38.413
She wanted a meeting.
She wanted to put this to bed.

22:38.514 --> 22:39.845
You know what happens
at that meeting?

22:39.982 --> 22:41.813
They ambush you.

22:41.918 --> 22:44.819
There were no demands
that came with this. Just the tape.

22:44.921 --> 22:47.685
The demands come in the meeting,
when you're face-to-face.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.656
When they have you by the balls,
when they're in control.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.751
We both know
that's how Olivia Pope works.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.861
There isn't gonna be a happy ending.

22:57.968 --> 22:59.560
- Liv isn't coming home.
- Okay.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.796
- She's not going to forgive you.
- Okay.

23:00.904 --> 23:01.893
She's going to take a knife,

23:02.005 --> 23:03.905
and she's going to gut you,
and she's going to walk away...

23:04.007 --> 23:05.941
I said okay!

23:12.050 --> 23:13.813
Oh, my God.

23:19.591 --> 23:20.990
I just left Rachel's parents' house.

23:21.092 --> 23:22.150
Mother tell you anything?

23:22.260 --> 23:23.420
<i>She wouldn't talk,
but she didn't have to,</i>

23:23.528 --> 23:26.054
She's a fourth-grade teacher and
there's an S-Class in the driveway.

23:26.165 --> 23:27.996
<i>Looks like a 2007, maybe 2008,</i>

23:28.100 --> 23:30.660
That's an $80,000 car that came out
the year her daughter was paid off.

23:30.770 --> 23:31.737
It must have been Rachel's.

23:31.871 --> 23:33.429
Exactly. You wanna know the best part?

23:33.539 --> 23:35.404
There's an American University sticker
on it.

23:35.508 --> 23:36.668
<i>Helen went to American,</i>

23:37.076 --> 23:38.338
Harrison, I'm gonna need you to get...

23:38.444 --> 23:40.071
Already on it.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.139
You're not a cop.

23:44.484 --> 23:45.508
Not even close.

23:45.619 --> 23:47.917
Usually all we get down here are cops.
Sometimes lawyers.

23:48.021 --> 23:49.420
But you're not a lawyer, either.

23:49.523 --> 23:51.184
I'm definitely not a cop.
Some days, I'm a lawyer,

23:51.291 --> 23:54.488
but today, I'm just a single man
looking for evidence.

23:54.594 --> 23:56.528
An old rape kit from a few years ago,
if you even have it.

23:56.797 --> 23:58.264
A woman named Rachel Kline?

23:58.865 --> 24:00.127
You flirting with me?

24:00.468 --> 24:03.767
'Cause I test rape kits all day.
Hundreds of them.

24:03.871 --> 24:07.170
Backlogged so bad, it'll be 10 years
before some of them even get opened.

24:07.275 --> 24:08.242
You know what's in a rape kit,

24:08.342 --> 24:10.173
guy-who's-sometimes-a-lawyer-
but-not-a-cop?

24:10.845 --> 24:15.782
Swabs. From her lips, her cheeks,
her thighs, her hair, her cervix,

24:15.883 --> 24:17.976
the panties she was wearing
when he pulled them down,

24:18.085 --> 24:19.576
the little bits of him
they combed off her body,

24:19.688 --> 24:21.383
and the comb they used to do it.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.481
If I can give you something
that's gonna get some justice

24:23.592 --> 24:26.755
for one of these women
whose pain and shame is in these bags,

24:26.862 --> 24:28.420
just ask me, I'll do it.

24:28.730 --> 24:30.595
But if you want anything else,
you've come to the wrong place.

24:30.699 --> 24:33.167
The rape kit will be fine.
Thank you, ma'am.

24:51.521 --> 24:57.017
Hey, Gideon? Hi, it's Quinn. Perkins.
From Olivia Pope and Associates.

24:58.229 --> 25:00.094
I was wondering if you wanted to grab a
drink with me tonight?

25:00.197 --> 25:01.357
If you're busy
it's completely and totally fine.

25:01.465 --> 25:02.432
We could do it another time.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.228
Tomorrow, or next week,
or never at all ever.

25:07.238 --> 25:11.072
Okay, sure. Bye.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.350
What?

25:19.584 --> 25:20.551
You're weird.

25:20.919 --> 25:21.886
I'm not weird.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.315
Weird is good.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.655
Thank you.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.024
Amanda settling in okay?

25:36.068 --> 25:37.831
I'm sorry we didn't vote.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.529
We never vote. Not really.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.668
Trust me, we're on the right side of this.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.472
Whose side, Liv? The White House's?
Amanda's?

25:48.347 --> 25:50.282
You have a conflict of interest
so big in this thing,

25:50.384 --> 25:51.783
I don't even think there's a word for it.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.109
Mellie.

25:54.221 --> 25:55.950
I hope
I'm not catching you at a bad time?

25:56.056 --> 25:57.990
<i>No, not at all, What can I do for you?</i>

25:58.091 --> 25:59.353
Well, you know,
we have that State Dinner tonight,

25:59.493 --> 26:00.551
and I checked, and I couldn't believe it,

26:00.661 --> 26:02.686
but it looks like
you didn't receive an invitation.

26:02.796 --> 26:04.593
Which was an oversight, I swear.

26:04.698 --> 26:06.757
I'm flattered. Truly. But to...

26:06.867 --> 26:09.234
8:00. See you then. Thank you.

26:16.477 --> 26:17.444
You're gonna want to see this.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.671
She met Travis in a bar,
in Adams Morgan.

26:20.782 --> 26:22.977
She was just out of
American, working at a lobbying firm.

26:23.084 --> 26:24.642
After a night of heavy drinking,

26:24.786 --> 26:26.687
Rachel went home with Travis
and he raped her.

26:26.855 --> 26:29.881
Filed a police report, rape kit and all.
Two days later, he made payments.

26:30.025 --> 26:31.083
Three payments to her account.

26:31.193 --> 26:33.252
Bought her an S-Class
to sweeten the deal.

26:33.529 --> 26:36.623
She recanted her story to the police.
Thought she could just move on,

26:36.732 --> 26:39.200
but she couldn't function.
Had to move back in with her parents.

26:39.301 --> 26:40.632
And then one night, about a year later,

26:40.736 --> 26:42.966
she swallowed enough Seconal
to end her life.

26:43.506 --> 26:46.373
She was found by a friend.
Her best friend.

26:46.476 --> 26:49.001
She changed her hair
from brunette to blonde, but it's still...

26:49.112 --> 26:50.579
Helen Fisher.

26:54.651 --> 26:57.176
You were right about Helen.
She was after Travis.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.183
But not for the money.

26:59.289 --> 27:00.483
She was after Travis because,

27:00.590 --> 27:03.424
four years ago,
he raped her best friend.

27:03.995 --> 27:07.954
Her name was Rachel Kline.
And you destroyed her life, Travis.

27:08.766 --> 27:10.393
But you're not guilty of raping Helen,

27:10.501 --> 27:12.298
and Rachel
can never testify against you.

27:12.403 --> 27:13.370
So you'll go free.

27:14.038 --> 27:15.005
Is this true?

27:16.273 --> 27:18.104
- Mom...
- Answer me, honey.

27:19.143 --> 27:21.112
I didn't want to tell you.

27:22.481 --> 27:25.507
I didn't want to disappoint you
any more than I...

27:26.451 --> 27:29.818
I'm sorry.
I screwed up, and I tried to fix it.

27:30.255 --> 27:31.620
I tried.

27:31.723 --> 27:34.886
You told me, you always said,
I should fix my mistakes.

27:34.993 --> 27:39.363
So I took care of it. I handled it.

27:46.105 --> 27:47.970
You went to Tony's on Thursdays

27:48.074 --> 27:50.269
because the defendant
went there on Thursdays.

27:50.410 --> 27:51.536
- Isn't that right?
- No, I...

27:51.644 --> 27:54.511
You went every Thursday
for six months!

27:54.614 --> 27:55.638
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes, but...

27:55.748 --> 27:56.807
You stalked him. Didn't you?

27:56.917 --> 27:59.249
Objection! Argumentative.
Sustained.

27:59.353 --> 28:02.754
You approached him as a brunette
and then, when he didn't respond,

28:02.856 --> 28:05.518
you changed your hair color,
so he would notice you!

28:05.626 --> 28:07.753
He hurt me! He pinned me down...

28:07.861 --> 28:10.921
Ms. Fisher!
Stick to the questions.

28:11.031 --> 28:12.430
You were obsessed.

28:12.533 --> 28:16.061
You change your hair color,
you follow Travis around,

28:16.905 --> 28:18.839
so you could seduce him.

28:18.940 --> 28:22.535
You went home with him,
you had consensual sex with him,

28:22.644 --> 28:26.603
and then you set him up.
Set all of us up!

28:42.731 --> 28:44.528
He's going to get off, isn't he?

28:47.002 --> 28:52.464
They're destroying that girl in there.
Travis is gonna be just fine.

28:54.578 --> 28:57.706
I signed him up for everything
when he was a kid.

28:57.814 --> 28:59.975
Hockey, soccer, lacrosse.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.775
I figured if I couldn't be around,
at least he'd stay busy,

29:02.919 --> 29:03.943
maybe he wouldn't notice.

29:04.488 --> 29:08.255
He was great at everything.
Made every All-Star team.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.022
In 10 years,
I never made it to a single game.

29:13.231 --> 29:14.994
It's not your fault.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.062
He hurt someone, Liv.

29:17.902 --> 29:19.870
He held her down and he...

29:21.639 --> 29:23.664
My son did that.

29:25.276 --> 29:26.835
He's a...

29:31.049 --> 29:32.710
What should I do?

29:34.920 --> 29:35.978
Tell me.

29:36.889 --> 29:39.585
There's nothing you can do.

29:39.691 --> 29:43.684
Who he is, what he is, it's not your fault.

29:55.542 --> 29:56.509
Here you go.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.301
Hey.
- What are you doing here?

29:59.412 --> 30:00.743
- Setting you up.
- Setting me up?

30:00.847 --> 30:02.839
Virgin margaritas for the lady, all night.

30:02.950 --> 30:06.249
And whatever her date orders,
gets a three-finger pour of booze in it.

30:06.353 --> 30:09.049
Put your hair down
and take that jacket off.

30:09.156 --> 30:12.216
Flirt just enough, but not too much,
and do not let him see you home.

30:12.326 --> 30:13.725
I can handle myself, you know?

30:13.827 --> 30:16.819
Well, I heard you on the phone.
You need to be set up.

30:39.488 --> 30:40.887
So nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

30:41.123 --> 30:42.283
- Thank you.
Hi.

30:44.694 --> 30:46.423
This is Prime Minister McMillan.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.532
Hi.
What's Olivia doing here?

30:52.735 --> 30:53.702
I invited her.

30:53.803 --> 30:54.861
- How are you, Bill?
- Good to see you.

30:55.004 --> 30:57.235
Yeah, you two know each other.

30:57.741 --> 31:00.471
Liv. You look lovely.

31:02.179 --> 31:03.146
Doesn't she look lovely?

31:03.247 --> 31:05.044
Of course, yeah.
I'm so happy you could come.

31:05.482 --> 31:07.211
I wouldn't miss it, Mr. President.

31:08.518 --> 31:12.045
Prime Minister, delightful to see you.
How is the new baby?

31:12.322 --> 31:14.449
Wonderful to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.

31:15.026 --> 31:18.962
Oh, hi! Great to see you.

31:28.773 --> 31:31.207
You're better than I expected.

31:31.342 --> 31:33.368
Well, they had ballroom dancing
at Andover.

31:33.479 --> 31:37.973
It was the only way I could get near
a girl back then, so I took it twice.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.582
Glad to see it's working out for you.

31:45.557 --> 31:46.854
What?

31:46.959 --> 31:50.486
Trying to figure out how I can sexually
harass you and get away with it.

31:50.596 --> 31:51.825
- Billy.
- What?

31:51.931 --> 31:54.866
You don't work here anymore.
You could date me. I'm a catch.

31:54.968 --> 31:57.596
Or is there another guy?

31:59.739 --> 32:01.673
I'd like a turn with
the best dancer in the West Wing.

32:01.775 --> 32:03.675
No offense, Fitz.

32:03.777 --> 32:04.971
None taken.

32:07.414 --> 32:08.608
- You mind?
- No.

32:09.283 --> 32:10.250
- Oh.
Oh!

32:31.840 --> 32:33.569
- Keep them coming.
Yes, sir.

32:37.479 --> 32:39.379
- Don't look at me.
- How come?

32:39.481 --> 32:41.312
Because everyone will know.

32:42.417 --> 32:45.386
- I can't not look at you.
- The song will be over in a minute.

32:45.488 --> 32:49.982
This is ridiculous.
Everything is ridiculous.

32:51.527 --> 32:52.494
How did it all get so...

32:54.497 --> 32:58.866
Damn it, just look at me. Look at me.

33:00.703 --> 33:03.137
- Meet me at our spot in 10 minutes.
- No.

33:03.841 --> 33:07.470
I am not spending
any more time away from you.

33:10.547 --> 33:13.345
Stop it. We're in public. Look away.

33:16.153 --> 33:19.816
I know I don't have the right, I know.

33:19.923 --> 33:22.222
I know you don't trust me. I...

33:26.898 --> 33:29.298
- I love you.
- Your wife is 10 feet away.

33:29.401 --> 33:30.868
- I love you.
- What about Amanda?

33:31.002 --> 33:33.937
I love you.

33:43.549 --> 33:46.279
- Our spot. Ten minutes.
- You can't leave your own State Dinner.

33:47.253 --> 33:48.686
Watch me.

33:58.198 --> 33:59.358
Generous bartender.

33:59.499 --> 34:00.989
I know, I'm so buzzed.

34:01.101 --> 34:02.500
- So should we get to it?
- I'm sorry?

34:02.602 --> 34:04.229
- I know why you called.
- You do?

34:04.371 --> 34:06.703
To find out what I know.
Dig around, find my weak spots.

34:06.807 --> 34:07.796
Let me save you some time.

34:07.908 --> 34:09.500
I have tried every drug
but the needle drugs,

34:09.609 --> 34:12.442
<i>but I'm only addicted to SportsCenter
and my BlackBerry.</i>

34:12.545 --> 34:16.108
Talked my way out of a DUl in Lubbock,
but the arrest record is still on file.

34:16.451 --> 34:19.284
Texas. And in eighth grade,
I stuffed the ballot box

34:19.387 --> 34:20.978
in an attempt to
rig the student council election.

34:21.088 --> 34:22.987
But I did it
to get closer to Jenny Marconi.

34:23.391 --> 34:26.827
- Not for the power. I still lost.
- Okay.

34:26.928 --> 34:28.418
I'm not giving up this story.

34:28.529 --> 34:31.190
It's my ticket off of metro
and onto national.

34:31.299 --> 34:32.288
And don't tell me it's not a story,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.630
'cause that would insult
what little intelligence I have.

34:34.735 --> 34:36.862
And I wouldn't believe you anyway,
because your boss is involved

34:36.972 --> 34:38.963
and you're a terrible liar
who's not the least bit buzzed.

34:39.074 --> 34:41.542
And I know that because
you've had as much as I've had

34:41.643 --> 34:43.132
and while I am genuinely buzzed,

34:43.245 --> 34:47.705
you are coiled like a cobra,
'cause you're so freaking tense.

34:49.016 --> 34:50.109
Now that you know everything,

34:50.219 --> 34:52.050
let's forget about work
for a couple of hours,

34:53.121 --> 34:54.646
get you a real drink.

34:57.660 --> 34:58.991
Why did you break the deal with Olivia?

34:59.796 --> 35:00.956
What are you talking about?

35:01.064 --> 35:03.157
You called Amanda.
I was there when she got the call.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.527
Don't get me wrong, I'm digging.

35:05.635 --> 35:08.229
I called Amanda's college roommate,
I called her friends at the White House,

35:08.338 --> 35:12.332
but I absolutely, positively,
did not call Amanda.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.638
I'm keeping my promise.
I want that quote.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.420
Oh, Cyrus. Hello.

35:25.523 --> 35:27.286
I don't know
what you think you're playing at, Liv,

35:27.424 --> 35:29.154
but I don't take kindly to blackmail.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.728
I'm sorry, what?

35:30.829 --> 35:33.127
I never took you
for the "hell hath no fury" type.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.359
It's a little trashy, but so is
having an affair with a married man.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.436
You ought to be careful, Cyrus,
with how you speak to me,

35:38.537 --> 35:40.903
because I might forget that
we are friends. Now, if you'll excuse...

35:41.006 --> 35:43.406
What happened, you danced?
He said he loved you?

35:43.508 --> 35:46.535
What, are you gonna go
meet him right now? He's good.

35:46.646 --> 35:48.739
He has you in the palm of his hand.
You're being played.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.981
You're being played by
the best politician in the world.

35:51.083 --> 35:54.450
The upside? The tell-all book
that you can write when you're old.

35:54.554 --> 35:56.886
<i>The President's Whore,
it's all very dirty and bestseller.</i>

35:58.491 --> 35:59.617
These very nice agents

35:59.992 --> 36:02.460
are going to escort you
off the White House grounds.

36:02.762 --> 36:06.529
And you can tell Amanda Tanner that
the meeting with the President is off.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.572
I was wrong before.

36:21.682 --> 36:22.809
Livvie? It's late.

36:22.917 --> 36:25.385
I was wrong before about it
not being your fault. It is your fault.

36:25.486 --> 36:26.453
What?

36:26.554 --> 36:29.216
You love him. You do.
But you can't fix everything for him.

36:29.324 --> 36:31.519
You can't. He's playing you.
Because you let him.

36:31.626 --> 36:34.459
You give him everything he asks for,
and you clean up his messes,

36:34.562 --> 36:36.154
and you believe him,
even when he lies to you,

36:36.264 --> 36:40.998
and that is not love.
Love is making him face who he is.

36:41.203 --> 36:44.866
The best thing you can do for him
is to do the best thing for him.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.405
It's not your fault, what he did,

36:46.508 --> 36:48.669
but letting him get away with it,
that is your fault.

36:58.787 --> 36:59.812
Mr. President.

36:59.923 --> 37:02.721
Cyrus, this is not a good time.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.290
Olivia's not coming.

37:04.694 --> 37:05.956
What?

37:06.062 --> 37:08.121
She canceled the meeting
with Amanda Tanner.

37:08.865 --> 37:12.562
She was playing you, twisting the knife.
I'm sorry, sir.

37:20.111 --> 37:21.772
I need to get back to the Prime Minister.

37:34.492 --> 37:37.053
You want me to turn myself in?

37:38.030 --> 37:42.626
That's a little drastic. Right, Mom?

37:43.035 --> 37:45.697
You raped that girl, Travis.
She killed herself.

37:45.804 --> 37:48.432
But that wasn't my fault. It wasn't.

37:48.573 --> 37:50.438
Travis, please. This is hard enough.

37:52.411 --> 37:56.041
So I made a couple of payments.
They can't put me away for that.

37:57.316 --> 38:01.480
There's a rape kit.
It's got your DNA all over it.

38:01.621 --> 38:02.781
But she never pressed charges.

38:03.022 --> 38:04.717
They don't even have my name.

38:05.958 --> 38:07.050
It happened once.

38:07.593 --> 38:10.027
- It'll never happen again, I promise.
- Travis...

38:10.129 --> 38:12.860
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my mother.

38:15.069 --> 38:17.537
I'll go away. How's that sound?

38:17.638 --> 38:19.435
I'll go to Europe for a couple years,

38:19.640 --> 38:21.198
and then I'll come back
and run the company.

38:21.308 --> 38:25.039
That was always the plan anyway.
That's a good compromise, right?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.003
That's what I thought you'd say.

38:28.782 --> 38:31.581
Well, good.
That takes care of the problem.

38:36.624 --> 38:38.489
I've already taken care of it, honey.

38:42.530 --> 38:45.556
You didn't. Mom?

38:48.337 --> 38:51.101
Don't do this, Mom! Mom!

38:52.141 --> 38:57.443
Don't do this! Mom! Listen to me.
Please! This is crazy.

38:57.546 --> 39:01.038
Jane Powell, my friend,
got transferred to misdemeanors.

39:01.383 --> 39:02.372
Oh?

39:02.485 --> 39:06.479
Something about incompetence.
Didn't research the defendant well.

39:06.757 --> 39:07.917
How sad for you.

39:09.559 --> 39:13.290
- Okay, maybe.
- Maybe what?

39:14.297 --> 39:17.357
Maybe we can be friends. Maybe.

39:27.678 --> 39:28.702
You okay?

39:29.947 --> 39:31.972
Why did you invite her
to the State Dinner?

39:33.618 --> 39:34.983
Olivia?

39:38.689 --> 39:40.020
Why would you do that?

39:46.231 --> 39:47.823
Because you needed to see her.

39:53.405 --> 39:55.669
I trust that tonight,
you'll sleep like a baby.

40:04.651 --> 40:05.845
Wait, where's Amanda?

40:05.952 --> 40:06.976
Change of plan.

40:07.086 --> 40:09.179
You're not getting a quote
from Amanda.

40:09.289 --> 40:12.122
Screwed by Olivia Pope.
Why am I not surprised?

40:12.225 --> 40:13.249
You're getting something better.

40:13.359 --> 40:14.826
Something that will actually
help your career.

40:14.928 --> 40:16.190
An interview with Sandra Harding.

40:16.296 --> 40:18.025
- Have you heard of her?
HDX, right?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.065
Her company's worth 300 million.

40:20.167 --> 40:23.534
About an hour ago, she turned her son
in to the U.S. Attorney for rape.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.263
Tomorrow, she's going to resign.

40:25.372 --> 40:28.808
She's agreed to tell you, and only you,
her side of the story.

40:28.909 --> 40:31.776
Not only will your byline
be on the front page of your paper,

40:31.879 --> 40:34.575
but this story, your exclusive story,

40:34.682 --> 40:37.174
will be chased by
every major newspaper in the country.

40:37.285 --> 40:39.150
And they'll get nothing.

40:39.821 --> 40:42.415
I know it's not cherry blossoms, but...

40:43.692 --> 40:47.150
Thank you. I... Thank you.

40:47.295 --> 40:49.263
Gideon, that was a meeting.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.093
I've been meaning to tell you,
it's probably nothing,

40:51.199 --> 40:52.325
but Gideon said this thing at drinks

40:52.434 --> 40:53.765
about how
he never called Amanda, not once.

40:53.869 --> 40:56.430
And my gut says to believe him,
my gut says he's not lying.

40:56.539 --> 40:59.667
- Reporters lie, Quinn.
- My gut says she's lying.

40:59.775 --> 41:01.402
I don't think
Amanda's telling you everything.

41:10.319 --> 41:12.481
He's mad at me. I get that.

41:14.758 --> 41:18.558
But if I could just have five minutes
alone with him,

41:18.662 --> 41:20.220
I know that I could explain.

41:20.330 --> 41:21.695
I know how hard this is.

41:22.466 --> 41:23.660
I'm sure you do.

41:24.902 --> 41:28.497
You're afraid that it was nothing.
That he's forgotten it already.

41:28.605 --> 41:31.939
Tossed you like yesterday's paper
and moved on without another thought.

41:32.043 --> 41:34.773
And if he's forgotten, then it's almost
as if it never happened.

41:34.879 --> 41:36.779
That what you had with him wasn't real.

41:36.881 --> 41:40.146
And that makes you feel
completely and utterly alone.

41:41.352 --> 41:43.547
But I haven't forgotten.

41:43.655 --> 41:46.852
I know what happened.
I know it was real.

41:46.958 --> 41:50.588
And whatever you decide to do here,
however you want to play this thing out,

41:50.696 --> 41:53.460
I will stand beside you,
every step of the way.

41:53.565 --> 41:56.898
If you ask me to,
I will make him remember.

41:57.002 --> 42:00.870
And you will never,
ever be alone in this again.

42:00.973 --> 42:05.569
But I'm going to need everything.
Every truth. Every detail.

42:05.678 --> 42:09.740
If I'm going to stand with you, Amanda,
I need to hear all of it.

42:15.722 --> 42:16.780
I'm pregnant.
