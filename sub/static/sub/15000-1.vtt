WEBVTT

00:49.482 --> 00:52.684
So if you're just joining us,
I am here with Andrew Kincaid.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.255
Brainchild behind sentinel,
the world's most rapidly

00:56.257 --> 00:58.624
growing video game company.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.693
And if I may say so, now,
one of the most powerful

01:01.695 --> 01:03.495
men on the planet.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.697
You recently made
headlines for your

01:05.699 --> 01:08.500
campaign against the
preservation of the right

01:08.502 --> 01:10.669
to bear arms in this
second amendment war

01:10.671 --> 01:12.838
that's been raging
in Washington.

01:12.840 --> 01:19.211
Complete with catchy slogan,
"keep guns in games."

01:19.579 --> 01:22.381
Well it's something that
I'm very passionate about.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.384
We've lost touch with how
lucky we are to be here.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.718
Uh, we piss on the planet.

01:26.720 --> 01:26.718
We piss on the animals, on
nature, and on each other.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.723
And then we raise our fists
in protests for our right

01:31.725 --> 01:34.560
to own a gun while people are
being killed left and right.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.462
And then we delude
ourselves into believing

01:36.464 --> 01:38.697
that gun that we own could
ever match might with the

01:38.699 --> 01:40.799
21st century American military.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.869
Gun ownership in this country
is an obsolete tradition.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.537
It can't protect us anymore.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.607
In fact, it's
clearly hurting us.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.843
Well, certainly a very
traditionalist perspective

01:50.845 --> 01:52.578
to support gun ownership.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.880
And the number of failed
bills reflects that.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.483
Traditions still stand
strong in America.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.884
That makes me very sad.

01:58.886 --> 02:02.387
I mean, what is it gonna take
to get that point across?

02:02.389 --> 02:05.891
And your solution would be to
contain violence to video games?

02:05.893 --> 02:09.828
Well, we're never gonna contain
it, but we can direct it.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.631
You wanna shoot something,
you wanna shoot somebody?

02:12.633 --> 02:13.765
Play a game.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.900
Play one of my games.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.335
Flight's not delayed
like we thought.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.504
Out the door in thirty, okay?

02:20.907 --> 02:23.909
Ors, we are not gonna be able to
sort through all these things.

02:23.911 --> 02:27.546
And speaking of your games,
what can you tell us about

02:27.548 --> 02:30.215
the rumors that your top
security officer, Orson

02:30.217 --> 02:33.485
creed, has been pushing
to move sentinel into

02:33.487 --> 02:34.586
military contracts.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.621
Come on.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.755
I dare you.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.490
Orson, we need to go.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.392
Yeah, hold on.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.760
I need to hear this.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.196
And how it can best be
used to serve to public.

02:44.198 --> 02:47.399
Mr. creed and I fall on
different sides of the aisle.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.667
And let's be clear about this.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.869
This is not the first time
he's tried to extract an

02:50.871 --> 02:52.538
intellectual property.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.807
But I could promise you,
it will be the last.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.644
So Orson creed would be
the one saying...

02:58.646 --> 03:01.213
Under his direction, sentinel
becomes a military

03:01.215 --> 03:02.514
tech developer.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.816
Are you hearing this?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.852
Do you expect anything less?

03:06.854 --> 03:10.556
Marrying ourselves to
tradition has held us back.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.659
People are resistant to
the future, but that

03:13.661 --> 03:15.427
doesn't stop it from coming.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.296
And if it's not me, it's
gonna be the next guy who

03:17.298 --> 03:18.564
takes up the reigns.

03:18.566 --> 03:22.201
At the end of the day,
it's your quarter.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.603
If any of you are unfamiliar
with Mr. Kincaid's

03:24.605 --> 03:26.905
gaming ambitions,
and from the numbers,

03:26.907 --> 03:28.540
there can't be too many.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.245
We've heard of where you think
Mr. creed is going to

03:33.247 --> 03:34.513
take sentinel...

03:34.515 --> 03:36.815
Tell us what you're doing
here, what you've done.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.685
I wanted to take the gaming
world and I wanted to push it.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.387
I wanted to push the inner
activity, the gameplay,

03:42.389 --> 03:43.422
the environment.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.725
Players wanna be in the game.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.760
And right now, we're
closer to that than

03:48.762 --> 03:48.760
anyone's ever been before.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.863
Well, you know, some of
your critics have been

03:51.865 --> 03:53.799
pretty vocal about
their issues with that.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.401
Especially given your outspoken
stance against guns.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.403
Yeah, I think you'd be
surprised how many of

03:58.405 --> 04:00.772
those critics have secret
gaming accounts of their own.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.243
Look, I have an issue with
guns on the street and I

04:04.245 --> 04:07.412
think that that issue will
be resolved. So...

04:07.414 --> 04:09.848
Take one more look around.
I'll start the car.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.287
Hey.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.257
I love you for not being him.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.892
In America, we are in the
business of making money.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.494
Come here.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.364
If I can do that while making
my country a little safer?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.499
Buddy, I call that
the American dream.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.769
People are literally
controlled by their phones

04:30.771 --> 04:33.705
and their tablets and
their social networks and

04:33.707 --> 04:35.307
the games that the play.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.313
Abbie!

04:41.881 --> 04:44.950
We live in a world
dominated by technology.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.585
Let her go.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.755
You can call it sad, or you
can call it whatever you want.

04:51.825 --> 04:56.828
But you can't argue
one fact, it is now.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.832
Oh...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.033
Just you.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.201
Just me.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.638
Come on.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.740
Thought you might come
outside for this one.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.707
Quit playing around.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.576
Come on.
Give it to me.

07:25.745 --> 07:29.047
Man, when is Kincaid gonna
stop with all the discs?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.849
Yeah, I guess it is kinda
old school for a new

07:30.851 --> 07:32.517
school guy, huh?

07:32.519 --> 07:34.786
Really nice way to say
someone's paranoid.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.022
Says the man who refuses
to leave his house.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.924
Shut up, Bernard.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.126
This is a new adventure.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.094
Stay tuned.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.930
- See ya.
- Mhm.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.089
Right on time, my Princess.

08:11.091 --> 08:15.260
Oh, gee. You know how I love
it when you call me Princess.

08:15.262 --> 08:19.531
So your highness, how art
thou on this majestic morning?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.600
I'm good! Another
day at the office.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.969
Jerry brought me crepes
for breakfast this morning.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.871
Jerry. That bastard.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.740
You tell that Jerry
that you're mine.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.141
All mine.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.676
Uh huh.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.278
That would require you to
get out of your house and

08:33.280 --> 08:34.880
take me out.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.648
Oh, Princess.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.850
How can you resist
my sex appeal?

08:40.621 --> 08:44.089
Oh, nothing sexier than sitting
on the other end of the phone

08:44.091 --> 08:46.791
while your coworker mods
a game against protocol.

08:46.793 --> 08:51.630
You know, first of all, that
only happened like three times.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.998
- Four times.
- Whatever.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.301
And second, mods made
the games better.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.936
Uh huh.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.907
Oh right.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.309
Let me give you your moment.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.742
So tell me about this game.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.611
Well, you won't be
modding this game.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
I can tell you that.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.714
Okay.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.616
This is the one.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.051
The Kincaid prophecy.

09:46.053 --> 09:46.051
The dream game.

09:46.053 --> 09:50.221
The one where you get
to be in the world.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.290
Really?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.025
This?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.295
Oh, hey!

09:57.297 --> 09:59.030
Keep talking.
I'm listening.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.765
Just gotta grab my pizza.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.669
Well, you'll be testing
the game frame mostly.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.106
Kincaid isn't ready to
reveal the real tech just yet.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.314
So can you tell me
about it then?

10:16.316 --> 10:19.150
Exactly how are
you in this world?

10:20.820 --> 10:21.886
No comment.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.688
Can we get some comment?
Any comment.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.724
Absolutely no comments.

10:25.726 --> 10:25.724
What about the rumors?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.659
He said no comment!

10:27.793 --> 10:29.194
Let's go, let's go.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.796
Hey, did you hear me?

10:31.798 --> 10:32.798
Hello?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.200
Sorry, no.
Uh, let's get started.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.735
We have a lot to cover.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.205
Alright.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.706
Let's do this.

11:23.717 --> 11:24.783
From behind.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.118
Let's go.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.423
Guys, we are on the clock.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.024
Gotta go, gotta go.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.695
Almost got it.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.021
Done!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.122
Done.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.491
What?

12:06.493 --> 12:07.459
Pack up the gear.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.060
I'll get the girl.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.798
Come on, boys.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.934
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

12:29.815 --> 12:33.218
Enjoy the ride, old friend.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.964
Style is great.

14:25.966 --> 14:26.965
Realistic.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.100
Kincaid wanted a
grounded universe.

14:29.102 --> 14:33.071
Meaning real human movement
with a stylized aesthetic.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.907
To distract from the
intense violence no doubt.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.242
You're so smart.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.576
You know.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.249
Can't say I've seen a game
start like this before.

14:44.251 --> 14:48.453
No menu, no options, no loading.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.888
Total immersion.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.289
That's the goal.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.534
Man, that looks
like Orson creed.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.270
So?

15:05.272 --> 15:08.139
Guess they designed it
before the total fallen

15:08.141 --> 15:10.074
out of destruction thing.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.609
I guess so.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.486
Ah, it's amazing.

15:22.521 --> 15:28.226
Almost like I can see anger.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.661
Pretty good, huh?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.264
Damn good.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.726
I guess I'm supposed
to grab that.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.563
Yup.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.468
Play me.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.303
Cute.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.441
Hey, ors!

16:16.443 --> 16:18.509
Good to see you're up and about.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.279
I bet you're wondering
about now just what the

16:21.281 --> 16:23.247
hell did we do to you.

16:23.249 --> 16:27.485
But you should know, how
can the artist forget his

16:27.487 --> 16:29.620
own artwork, right?

16:32.124 --> 16:37.228
We've got a series of
tasks for you, ors.

16:37.230 --> 16:41.566
And I can't wait to see
you make it through

16:41.568 --> 16:43.768
because I know you will, buddy.

16:44.403 --> 16:49.307
You'll have 90 minutes to
complete each objective.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.044
If you fail, ors...

16:53.046 --> 16:55.480
I hope you're listening, buddy.

16:55.482 --> 16:59.684
If you fail to finish in
the 90 minute window,

16:59.686 --> 17:06.590
you beautiful wife, Abbie,
loses a body part per objective.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.759
K?

17:09.294 --> 17:10.728
Okay.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.063
Mission one.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.464
National bank is
about to be robbed.

17:14.467 --> 17:19.203
Your mission is to get
inside, undetected, during

17:19.204 --> 17:22.339
the robbery and retrieve
the contents of safety

17:22.342 --> 17:26.044
deposit box 1121.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.479
Do you hear me?

17:28.481 --> 17:31.716
If you're compromised,
it's all over.

17:33.352 --> 17:39.123
Think of Abbie,
beautiful, Abbie.

17:39.658 --> 17:43.461
Okay, scout, you
better get a move on.

17:43.463 --> 17:48.266
Your 90 minutes begin now.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.472
Heavy.

17:54.474 --> 17:58.142
Yet, still has a classic
video game setup.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.145
How can we embrace the new
without acknowledging the old?

18:01.147 --> 18:03.181
True that, true that.

18:27.206 --> 18:31.275
Inventory, inventory.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.244
Hit the Grey button.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.348
No inventory menu either?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.884
What, he just pulls out
whatever he has on him?

18:39.886 --> 18:42.253
That's weird, but okay.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.604
Ladies and gentlemen, just in.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.540
We are getting unconfirmed
reports of armed men from

19:02.542 --> 19:04.709
the Southtown branch
of National bank.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.211
No details as of yet.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.480
I'm told one of our
reporters is sending us

19:09.482 --> 19:11.883
text messages from the scene.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.751
From inside the bank.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.553
Please stand by.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.322
I'm gonna stay on the
line today with you.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.924
Orders straight from the top.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.626
Yes, ma'am.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.594
Why don't you just beam me
with excitement over your

19:23.596 --> 19:25.229
assignment?

19:25.231 --> 19:27.665
Max, I didn't mean it
like that. I mean...

19:27.667 --> 19:31.936
Oh, come on, Princess.
Say it with me... smitten!

19:31.938 --> 19:33.504
Who says that anymore?

19:33.506 --> 19:34.506
I say it.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.908
Oh shit.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.413
I wonder if I uh...

19:42.415 --> 19:44.282
Max, stay on the mission.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.883
We're on a time table remember?

19:45.885 --> 19:47.885
Yeah, totally.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.290
Max!

19:54.260 --> 19:56.494
I told you to stay
on the mission!

19:56.496 --> 19:58.696
Well, I guess I don't want
any stars or anything.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.964
Don't do that again.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.966
What? It's just a game.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.467
Relax.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.670
Just having a little
fun, that's all.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.973
Um, yeah. Just remember
the clock is running.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.575
Yeah, right.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.480
Oh shit.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.924
How the hell am I supposed
to get in there undetected?

21:19.811 --> 21:21.091
- Let's move.
- Dear god, please!

21:21.914 --> 21:23.514
- Please no!
- Stay down!

21:23.516 --> 21:26.050
We see movement,
we start shooting.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.451
Get it?

21:28.020 --> 21:29.820
Open the vault!

21:46.038 --> 21:47.938
Gotta be the manager.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.075
Hey!

21:52.344 --> 21:53.778
Get the bags ready.

22:00.385 --> 22:01.786
What are you doing?

22:02.521 --> 22:04.355
How do I talk to people?

22:04.357 --> 22:07.091
Hit the black button with
the cursor over her.

22:09.594 --> 22:10.795
Hey, baby.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.464
Hey, baby.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.466
What?

22:16.369 --> 22:17.501
Yeah.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.107
I've never seen mpc's
react like that before.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.443
Well it's probably because
you're being a douche.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.811
Oh hey!

22:26.813 --> 22:28.579
Sweetie pie.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.881
Oh, you getting a little
jealous on me or what?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.683
Uh, hardly.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.085
I kinda like it.

22:35.821 --> 22:39.623
I need to access safety
deposit box 1121.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.792
Are you crazy?

22:41.794 --> 22:45.596
I need to access safety
deposit box 1121.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.865
Wait, where do I know you from?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.633
I need the keys, ma'am.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.968
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.637
I need the keys right now.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.673
I don't have them.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.875
They're in my desk.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.677
It's over there.

23:02.514 --> 23:06.083
Well, I think this is two
points for difficulty.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.491
Get down!

23:32.411 --> 23:33.511
Okay.

23:34.679 --> 23:35.980
Bingo.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.082
Oh!

23:43.855 --> 23:44.922
What is this?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.657
Is this thing on?

23:52.497 --> 23:54.465
Hey, you got a hot
shot over here.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.501
Drop the gun or you're dead.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.470
3, 2, 1.

23:59.671 --> 24:01.038
Okay, okay!

24:30.636 --> 24:32.937
- I got the bag.
- Sweet!

24:32.939 --> 24:34.939
Tryna murk some mpc's.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.208
Stealth is key for
this mission, Max.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.642
Thanks for the tip.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.978
And um, don't kill any hostages.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.546
You'll fail the mission.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.916
Um, someone's being a
little drama queen.

24:45.918 --> 24:46.951
Relax.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.220
I can always reload
and auto-save.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.830
Hey, you're all gonna die.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.532
Get him!

25:01.766 --> 25:04.201
Everybody, stay down!
Stay down!

25:04.203 --> 25:05.503
Check right.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.104
Clear.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.953
What was that?
I didn't copy.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.790
Come again.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.196
Smile for the cameras.

26:20.947 --> 26:21.947
I see him!

26:44.235 --> 26:46.003
Knock, knock.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.377
You're dead.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.188
Hey, I'm gonna take
a quick break.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.027
Why won't this damn thing pause?

27:44.029 --> 27:46.430
Uh, I'll look into it.

27:47.032 --> 27:50.234
Well, I'm still taking a break.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.302
Man's gotta take a leak.

27:53.204 --> 27:55.205
We're here with bank
manager, Lillian Brandt,

27:55.207 --> 27:58.275
who is one of the hostages
in this crisis.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.245
Can you confirm that he
killed all the suspects?

28:02.047 --> 28:06.016
No, he stopped them.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.852
And you're saying this
man is Orson creed.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.220
What the hell?

28:10.222 --> 28:12.222
I didn't recognize him at first.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.824
It was a mess in there.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.326
The Orson creed who was
recently fired following

28:16.328 --> 28:19.296
disputes with sentinel
ceo, Andrew Kincaid?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.464
No.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.833
He saved my life.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.935
I just wish that
I could thank him.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.871
It just seemed like he was
gone as fast as he came.

28:29.741 --> 28:33.777
If you're out there, thank you.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.879
We're awaiting comment
from sentinel and

28:35.881 --> 28:37.715
authorities tell us attempts
to contact Orson creed

28:37.717 --> 28:40.851
- no, this is not right.
- And his wife have failed.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.854
Ladies and gentlemen, you
are as confused as we are.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.789
Stay with us.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.228
Ladies and gentlemen,
these cellphone photos

28:51.230 --> 28:54.898
just came to us from
our source inside.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.900
Uh, it looks pretty convincing.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.937
Orson creed, apparent
hero, leaving the bank

28:59.939 --> 29:01.739
with two million dollars.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.440
As far as we know, the
money has not been

29:03.442 --> 29:06.910
recovered and there is
no sign of Orson creed.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.079
Is everything okay?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.047
I'm calling the police.

29:10.049 --> 29:10.948
What!

29:10.950 --> 29:12.249
Max, no!

29:12.251 --> 29:13.150
Max!

29:13.152 --> 29:14.752
9-1-1 operator.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.487
Sit down and play the game.

29:16.489 --> 29:16.487
What's going on?

29:16.489 --> 29:20.357
I should be asking you that.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.127
I sit down and start
playing this brand new game

29:23.129 --> 29:26.964
and all of a sudden my mission
is on the goddamn news.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.533
- There's no way.
- Calm down, Max.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.101
Calm down?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.336
Calm down.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.806
Just tell me.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.108
Did I just kill a
bunch of people?

29:38.110 --> 29:40.244
You need to listen
to me right now.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.012
You need to keep playing, Max.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.047
Trust me, just keep playing.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.282
You have to.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.151
Not until I figure
out what's going on.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.286
The only thing I'm doing is
turning this damn thing off.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.821
Max, no!

29:53.391 --> 29:56.160
Hello, Max.

29:56.162 --> 29:59.062
No, this is not happening.

29:59.064 --> 30:00.330
Shut up!

30:00.332 --> 30:04.535
And listen very, very carefully.

30:04.537 --> 30:07.037
Your life depends on it.

30:21.352 --> 30:25.823
Now let me be perfectly clear.

30:25.825 --> 30:30.160
If you, Max, try to call
the authorities, turn off

30:30.162 --> 30:33.363
your console, or
leave the house...

30:33.365 --> 30:38.068
Which shouldn't be a
problem for you, right?

30:39.204 --> 30:42.439
We're going to kill your
girl and then we're gonna

30:42.441 --> 30:44.541
tell the cops what you did.

30:44.543 --> 30:45.542
What?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.177
What are you talking about?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.279
I'd check your bank account.

30:51.616 --> 30:54.551
I can see it in
the headlines now.

30:55.286 --> 30:58.188
Say it isn't so, Max.

31:17.308 --> 31:18.442
Shit.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.879
I think you get the point.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.047
Now finish the game.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.182
Max.

31:25.917 --> 31:26.950
Max.

31:26.952 --> 31:31.021
You have to finish the game.

32:11.195 --> 32:12.362
Ors!

32:12.364 --> 32:14.131
I knew you'd make it.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.198
Good job.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.367
Very exciting stuff.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.970
Your wife keeps
her digits for now.

32:19.972 --> 32:23.273
Let's see how you do on
round two, shall we?

32:23.275 --> 32:26.610
There's a private school
a few miles north.

32:26.612 --> 32:31.214
There's about to be
another shooting.

32:31.216 --> 32:35.452
Get there and wait for
further instructions.

32:53.504 --> 32:55.739
Please try to stay in the game.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.141
I can't believe you're
a part of all this.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.043
They didn't give me a choice.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.345
Save it.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.647
You're just a voice!

33:03.649 --> 33:05.682
Tech support.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.529
Okay, champ!

33:19.531 --> 33:21.531
Good god, this guy is annoying.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.434
There's a shooter
in the building.

33:24.436 --> 33:27.004
The authorities are
about to be contacted.

33:27.006 --> 33:30.440
Internal security will
attempt to take him out.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.510
You are going to stop them.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.513
- What?
- You heard it right, folks.

33:36.515 --> 33:41.785
Your mission is to
protect the shooter.

33:41.787 --> 33:47.257
And if you refuse, I've
been itching to spend some

33:47.259 --> 33:51.194
time with Abbie.

33:53.264 --> 33:55.565
Clock starts now.

33:56.634 --> 33:58.602
I'm not doing this.

33:58.604 --> 33:59.503
No.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.038
Max, you have to.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.205
No!

34:02.207 --> 34:04.408
I don't wanna die.

34:18.156 --> 34:19.523
I'm sorry.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.145
Oh god.

34:57.261 --> 34:58.195
Let me go!

34:58.197 --> 34:59.496
Let me go!

35:00.631 --> 35:03.166
They're gonna kill my mother!

35:07.839 --> 35:08.839
You!

35:31.596 --> 35:32.796
No, no, no, no!

35:40.738 --> 35:42.272
Max.

35:44.876 --> 35:48.512
Max! You have to get
him out of there.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.367
Ladies and gentlemen,
we go now to frank b. Cooper

36:10.369 --> 36:13.870
high school where a shooting
has just taken place.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.439
Tragic day for our city.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.376
You look sad, Orsy.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.312
Why the blues?

36:55.314 --> 36:57.781
You should be so happy.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.417
Abbie's still in one piece.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.352
Nothing?

37:02.354 --> 37:04.721
No witty comeback?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.490
That hurts my feelings.

37:07.492 --> 37:11.228
Your next mission is a juicy...

37:15.000 --> 37:17.601
Max, what are you doing?

37:18.736 --> 37:20.971
Improvising.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.982
Can you hear me?

37:33.351 --> 37:37.254
This is your player.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.724
I need your help.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.403
Please eat.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.878
I missed our lunches, Abbie.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.916
You're as beautiful
now as you ever were.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.489
Well...

38:12.491 --> 38:14.324
Let's not quibble over details.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.860
You were a snake then,
and you're a snake now.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.529
Okay, well I'll take
that as a compliment.

38:19.531 --> 38:23.300
A snake is an evolutionary
masterpiece and incredibly

38:23.302 --> 38:24.701
misunderstood.

38:24.703 --> 38:28.605
And like the snake, I'm just
doing what needs to be done.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.976
Though I don't seem to
remember you putting up

38:32.978 --> 38:38.682
such a fuss back when I
was paying your bills.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.885
No one could type a
memo quite like you.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.356
You ever tell creed about us?

38:46.358 --> 38:48.825
There is no us,
you piece of shit.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.428
Well...

38:51.430 --> 38:53.096
Not for a while, right?

38:57.635 --> 39:00.370
Churchill.

39:00.372 --> 39:04.441
I keep Winston up there to
remind me to stay the course.

39:04.443 --> 39:08.745
He once said, you have enemies?

39:08.747 --> 39:10.380
Good.

39:10.382 --> 39:15.385
That means you stood up for
something sometime in your life.

39:15.387 --> 39:19.089
You can't expect everyone
to believe in your vision.

39:19.091 --> 39:22.759
But when they wake up one
day in a better world,

39:22.761 --> 39:25.929
they will thank you
for your contribution.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.566
Yes.

39:56.460 --> 40:02.465
That husband of yours
is a stubborn man.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.567
You've underestimated him.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.172
He's a survivor.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.007
God, that's what
I love about you.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.709
You're so dramatic.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.944
You're just...
You're unpredictable.

40:16.981 --> 40:20.116
I hate to eat and run, but uh...

40:20.118 --> 40:25.922
Your husband is actually
becoming a bit of a nuisance.

40:26.490 --> 40:30.693
And I need to go remind
the dog who's master.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.006
I'll be back.

40:44.875 --> 40:50.747
To build maybe the slow and
laborious tasks of years.

40:50.749 --> 40:54.918
To destroy can be the
thoughtless act of a single day.

40:56.987 --> 40:59.222
Churchill said that, too.

41:00.758 --> 41:03.059
Careful of your dreams, Andrew.

41:20.244 --> 41:21.878
Time to bring the pain.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.113
Yo, yo, incoming, incoming!

41:24.115 --> 41:25.048
We've got trees over here.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.649
Watch out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:40.231 --> 41:41.831
Get some, get some!

41:43.767 --> 41:45.134
You don't want none
of this, creed.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.870
You don't want
none of this, huh!

41:52.109 --> 41:53.576
Get back here, creed!

42:03.721 --> 42:04.721
Shit.

42:07.057 --> 42:08.057
No, no, no!

42:11.662 --> 42:14.230
Never thought you'd
betray us, creed.

42:17.134 --> 42:18.134
Yes!

42:20.871 --> 42:21.871
That's it.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.288
You know what, creed...

42:41.992 --> 42:45.161
Kincaid ordered not to shoot.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.163
But I'm gonna shoot you anyway!

42:48.899 --> 42:49.899
Yes!

42:52.002 --> 42:53.670
Oh!

43:33.644 --> 43:35.011
Wow.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.116
What's up?

43:41.652 --> 43:43.386
Right. You can't talk.

43:44.688 --> 43:45.955
Hey, you there?

43:45.957 --> 43:46.990
Me?

43:46.992 --> 43:49.192
You said I can't mod this game.

43:49.194 --> 43:50.860
Max.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.095
But you can.

43:52.097 --> 43:53.630
I can't.

43:53.632 --> 43:55.231
Unblock the speech frequency.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.766
Max, I...

43:57.201 --> 43:59.035
Do it.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.370
Or I'm done.

44:01.705 --> 44:03.706
And so are you.

44:12.082 --> 44:13.883
You okay?

44:18.355 --> 44:20.890
Who the hell is that?

44:21.925 --> 44:24.060
Tech support.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.969
No.

44:32.971 --> 44:35.405
Let them find the bugs.

44:35.407 --> 44:38.141
Let them think that
they're ahead.

44:38.143 --> 44:39.909
It won't matter.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.449
I wanna see where he takes this.

44:47.718 --> 44:50.353
How do you my house
is bugged, Mr. creed?

44:52.790 --> 44:56.059
I created every security
protocol for sentinel

44:56.061 --> 44:57.960
including bugging.

45:01.865 --> 45:03.466
You bugged my house?

45:04.168 --> 45:08.971
Everything you received from
sentinel is monitoring you.

45:12.142 --> 45:13.743
Show me.

45:35.866 --> 45:37.834
I need a beer.

45:39.803 --> 45:41.471
Come on, join me.

45:46.810 --> 45:48.778
Well drink up.

45:56.453 --> 45:59.088
Oops, my bad!

46:01.191 --> 46:03.359
We'll get that
cleaned up no problem.

46:05.162 --> 46:08.131
So you're sentinel's
secret weapon?

46:09.867 --> 46:11.467
Right here in the flesh.

46:13.904 --> 46:15.505
Just a gamer.

46:21.211 --> 46:22.845
So tell me...

46:24.214 --> 46:28.551
What is all this that
you're doing, Mr. creed?

46:29.419 --> 46:34.190
My wife calls me Mr.
Creed when she's upset.

46:34.558 --> 46:36.959
We just met kid.

46:37.895 --> 46:43.266
I develop a technology
that connects you to me.

46:43.268 --> 46:45.268
It's called control x.

46:46.237 --> 46:47.537
Control x?

46:48.172 --> 46:50.206
Sounds like a
bad Sci-Fi movie.

46:50.208 --> 46:53.109
It's the prototype.

46:53.111 --> 46:55.845
It was meant for
surveillance, but I

46:55.847 --> 46:58.247
thought it better
suited for military.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.082
Why military?

47:00.084 --> 47:02.151
I served a couple of tours.

47:02.153 --> 47:04.987
Lost a few too many friends.

47:04.989 --> 47:09.258
Control x is about making
stronger soldiers with

47:09.260 --> 47:13.329
faster reflexes with
two sets of eyes.

47:14.431 --> 47:17.066
And what's Kincaid got
to do with all this?

47:17.068 --> 47:21.237
I'm not sure, but he
has some master plan.

47:21.239 --> 47:22.872
Keeps guns in games.

47:22.874 --> 47:24.340
No, that's bullshit.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.408
I know Kincaid.

47:25.410 --> 47:27.076
He's a one percenter.

47:27.078 --> 47:30.012
He doesn't care how many lives
it takes to keep his billions.

47:30.014 --> 47:35.418
I wanted control x to save
people, he wants it to use them.

47:35.420 --> 47:37.153
So why'd you work for him?

47:37.155 --> 47:39.522
He paid me good money.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.891
Ah, yeah.

47:43.126 --> 47:45.428
What about that Zane guy?

47:45.430 --> 47:48.097
He's just a dog on a leash.

47:48.099 --> 47:50.099
Brought in for muscle.

47:50.101 --> 47:52.535
He's a glory seeker.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.904
Wants everything I got.

47:56.406 --> 47:58.074
Hang on a second.

47:58.076 --> 47:59.575
Authorities have now
confirmed through

47:59.577 --> 48:02.578
surveillance footage,
Orson creed has gone from

48:02.580 --> 48:05.381
bank hero to murderer.

48:05.383 --> 48:08.150
Strange and bizarre
day for our city.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.419
An example of a man unhinged.

48:11.188 --> 48:12.421
Truly shocking.

48:12.423 --> 48:15.358
That's a load of shit.
Come on.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.060
Just call me Oswald.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.962
I'm the distraction.

48:19.964 --> 48:21.497
From what?

48:21.499 --> 48:23.499
The future of gaming.

48:24.334 --> 48:26.469
What got you into it, kid?

48:29.907 --> 48:36.145
Well um, it's just a
world that I fit in.

48:36.147 --> 48:39.982
People in the real world
tend to let you down.

48:40.517 --> 48:43.286
You lose someone who's
special in a game,

48:43.288 --> 48:45.221
it doesn't hurt as bad.

48:46.690 --> 48:51.928
Today actually marks two years
since I left this house.

48:53.363 --> 48:54.697
Yeah.

48:59.369 --> 49:03.205
I was uh...

49:03.207 --> 49:07.610
I was coming from the gaming
tournament that I won and

49:07.612 --> 49:11.514
being famous sometimes
makes you unpopular.

49:12.316 --> 49:16.118
It was the middle of the
day, I was out walking

49:16.120 --> 49:21.057
with my best friend...

49:22.693 --> 49:27.296
And they drove by,
windows came down.

49:28.065 --> 49:33.135
Let's just say that
they missed me.

49:35.138 --> 49:36.605
Here's a picture.

49:38.342 --> 49:39.575
Take a look.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.020
What?

49:56.360 --> 49:59.395
I loved that dog, okay?

50:01.031 --> 50:05.568
Best thing that ever happened
to me before that day.

50:06.737 --> 50:10.373
It's not always easy losing
someone you care about.

50:13.276 --> 50:15.177
You should know that, right?

50:33.764 --> 50:35.297
A signal.

50:36.066 --> 50:39.135
You gotta get this
thing out of me, kid.

50:39.137 --> 50:40.336
What the hell?

50:40.338 --> 50:42.204
I don't know how to do that.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.708
I do.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.523
I'm gonna go flush
out this beer.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.109
No.

51:53.111 --> 51:54.443
Stand down.

51:55.479 --> 51:57.179
I've got this.

52:10.861 --> 52:13.529
I think you've had enough fun.

52:13.531 --> 52:15.231
Why are you doing this?

52:15.233 --> 52:16.398
Where is he?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.367
Creed?

52:18.369 --> 52:20.302
I'm here.

52:24.541 --> 52:26.876
I'm disappointed in you, Max.

52:26.878 --> 52:30.279
I chose you because
you're the best.

52:30.281 --> 52:33.716
You understand the game world
and you understand rules.

52:33.718 --> 52:37.186
Well you've broken the rules
so that means a penalty.

52:37.188 --> 52:37.186
Tell me something.

52:37.188 --> 52:40.489
How are you and your
girl doing, huh?

52:40.491 --> 52:44.260
I'm sensing some
trust issues there.

52:44.262 --> 52:46.295
I would kill it every
time, my friend.

52:46.297 --> 52:51.267
I mean, what do we have if
we can't trust each other?

52:51.801 --> 52:55.371
Princess, you okay?

52:55.373 --> 52:59.375
She could be, but
that's up to you.

53:00.377 --> 53:02.878
Here are five feeds of
five sentinel employees.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.948
Each equally
disappointing to me.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.583
You're naughty girl
is one of them.

53:07.585 --> 53:08.617
Come on, that's bullshit.

53:08.619 --> 53:09.785
You know I've seen her.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.820
Pay attention, Max.

53:11.822 --> 53:14.456
That's the point.

53:14.458 --> 53:17.793
You choose wisely, she lives.

53:17.795 --> 53:21.530
You choose poorly, they all die.

53:22.465 --> 53:23.599
Tell you what.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.935
I'm gonna make it easy on you.

53:29.439 --> 53:30.706
Do it.

53:38.815 --> 53:39.848
No.

53:39.850 --> 53:42.518
You should be thanking me, Max.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.221
Now you just got four choices.

53:45.223 --> 53:46.855
You got sixty seconds.

53:46.857 --> 53:47.990
Good luck.

53:47.992 --> 53:49.225
Shit!

53:57.500 --> 53:58.667
Max!

54:00.804 --> 54:02.905
Max, what the hell is going on?

54:02.907 --> 54:04.006
I don't know.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.941
I don't know!

54:06.676 --> 54:07.743
Shit.

54:16.987 --> 54:18.020
There.

54:18.022 --> 54:19.021
That's her.

54:19.023 --> 54:19.755
It's her!

54:19.757 --> 54:20.923
Feed 4.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.024
Feed 4!

54:22.026 --> 54:23.459
Come on, feed 4!

54:23.461 --> 54:24.727
It's her!

54:38.675 --> 54:40.643
Congratulations.

54:40.645 --> 54:42.344
Why are you doing this?

54:42.979 --> 54:44.446
What the hell do you want?

54:44.448 --> 54:46.548
You'll be getting a
message with instructions.

54:46.550 --> 54:50.753
And little man, I
suggest you follow them.

55:06.403 --> 55:07.936
Baby, I'm okay.

55:10.740 --> 55:13.842
They want you to go to the
ground floor of the needle.

55:16.413 --> 55:21.517
Caleb Angelo will be
leaving a dinner and they

55:21.519 --> 55:22.985
want you to kill him.

55:23.586 --> 55:24.787
I love you.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.538
I get it now.

55:42.540 --> 55:43.939
Well tell me.

55:43.941 --> 55:48.811
Caleb Angelo owns 51% of the
world's largest server file.

55:48.813 --> 55:51.847
Kincaid only owns 40%.

55:51.849 --> 55:55.718
With Angelo out of the way, he
can scoop up all of the shares.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.619
Complete control.

55:58.121 --> 56:00.522
He wants to play god.

56:03.126 --> 56:05.094
Let's do this.

56:05.096 --> 56:07.529
Alright, okay.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.502
Creed.

56:48.471 --> 56:49.972
Go get your wife back.

56:53.143 --> 56:56.145
I'm sorry about your loss.

57:43.761 --> 57:46.695
You know I'm coming after you.

57:46.697 --> 57:48.664
Give you a good show.

58:32.809 --> 58:34.810
Yeah, hi.

58:34.812 --> 58:37.980
Can I get some popcorn, soda?

58:38.915 --> 58:40.282
Thanks.

58:45.089 --> 58:46.255
- Max.
- Hey!

58:46.257 --> 58:47.756
Are you okay?

58:47.758 --> 58:48.690
Shit.

58:48.692 --> 58:49.725
I almost killed this dude.

58:49.727 --> 58:50.993
- What!
- No, nevermind.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.628
What happened?

58:52.630 --> 58:54.696
They told me I was reassigned,
but I managed to sneak away.

58:54.698 --> 58:56.198
I'm here to help how I can.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.800
I'm so sorry that I
got you into this.

58:58.802 --> 58:59.835
Yeah, don't worry about it.

58:59.837 --> 59:01.236
The important
thing is your safe.

59:01.238 --> 59:02.704
What do you mean?

59:02.706 --> 59:04.640
If I live through all
this, I'll tell you how I

59:04.642 --> 59:06.642
saved your life like for real.

59:06.644 --> 59:08.277
You can't tease
a girl like that.

59:08.845 --> 59:10.245
Putting you on speaker.

59:13.049 --> 59:14.850
I'm feeling adventurous.

59:14.852 --> 59:17.286
Just remember, there's
no rebooting here.

59:17.288 --> 59:18.921
If he dies, you're done.

59:18.923 --> 59:21.590
Go big or go home, right?

59:21.592 --> 59:22.824
I always wanted to do this.

59:22.826 --> 59:25.694
Do what? I'm just
booting up my laptop.

59:25.696 --> 59:26.728
This.

59:28.164 --> 59:29.197
Yes!

59:29.199 --> 59:31.233
Max, are you hanging from a car?

59:31.235 --> 59:33.702
Why yes, your highness, I am.

59:33.704 --> 59:35.771
You stay away from my dad.

59:35.773 --> 59:36.939
Who the hell is this guy?

59:36.941 --> 59:39.808
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

59:48.318 --> 59:49.618
Hey!

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.000
Get him, boys!

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:07.235
Do what the hell I pay you for!

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.645
- Whoa!
- Dad!

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.953
Hey, look.
I am rich!

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.221
I'll pay you whatever
they're paying you and

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.956
I'll double it!

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.358
I'm not a bad guy.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.093
I'll do anything for you.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.294
I have a daughter.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.296
She's beautiful, super hot.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:35.330
You can have her.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:36.765
I'll give her to you.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.200
Just let me go.

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:40.102
Come on, guy, come on!

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:42.004
Max, are you...

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:43.839
Finishing the game.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:47.142
Who the hell are you?

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.187
Hey! Fuck you!

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.665
Yeah. What the hell is
going on over there?

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.433
Angelo should've
recognized creed.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:14.936
Sir, he's here.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:16.972
Lock it down.

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.708
Lock it down!

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.009
Yes, sir.

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.118
We're locked down, gentlemen.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.720
No one out.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.955
You know who's coming.

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:37.693
And remember no shooting.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.695
So unstrap.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.433
Now.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.211
Kincaid wants him alive
and wait for my command.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.281
Creed.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:41.523
What makes you think you
can just walk back in here?

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:43.024
Where's Abbie?

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.030
Come to rescue your girl?

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:55.003
I heard she had a lovely
meal with her boss.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:08.784
They might even be getting
ready to call it a night.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:12.020
I'm not leaving
here without her.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.426
You hear that?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:23.031
He's not leaving without her.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:37.045
Fuck you.

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:45.854
I've retired from violence.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:55.197
Guess we're gonna call
this a cheat day.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.003
Tear that bitch's
arms and legs off.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.591
Creed!

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.035
All personal.
Report to main entrance.

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.612
Let's go!

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.147
Come on, creed!

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.183
- Get up!
- You ain't nothing!

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.361
Stop!

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.012
- Come on, creed!
- Get up!

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.098
Dead man.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.652
Creed!

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.323
Oh, no!

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.231
Get up!

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.599
This isn't over.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.705
I gave you a chance.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:31.840
What?

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:40.381
I gave you a chance.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.438
We were like brothers.

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.482
Abbie!

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:23.318
Stop.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.819
Right there.

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:30.458
She'll be dead before
you can touch her.

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:32.694
So...

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:35.897
Where's Zane?

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:37.365
He's dead.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.801
Congratulations.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.670
Well maybe you're next.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.274
Maybe.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:49.544
Is this what this
all comes down to?

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.749
Well, I hope you've rehearsed.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.652
That's cute.

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:03.024
And for your information,
yes, I have.

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:07.528
I gotta say you were uh,
fairly impressive, but I mean,

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:10.965
what else would we expect
from the great Orson creed?

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:12.734
Am I right?

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:17.805
Well I had some help, but
you know all about that.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.474
Yes, you did.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:23.378
Which reminds me,
where is Robin?

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.380
Oh yeah.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.653
In my evil trap.

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.389
So...

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:40.461
Onto the monologue, yeah?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:45.033
What was it you wanted
to know, my master plan?

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.637
Well it's your game, maestro.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:50.838
Always a gentlemen.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.907
Even under duress.

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:56.544
But why kids?

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.346
Why would you kill children?

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:02.016
They're causalities of war.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.353
You're delusional.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.490
I'm delusional?

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:18.666
It's broken, creed.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:22.370
The whole damn show is broken.

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.872
And you wanna take control x
and you wanna give it to the

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:28.910
puppeteers, the people who
sell you, sell all of us

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:31.913
on America, land of the free.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:35.817
You wanna do that and
you call me delusional?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:40.588
I see the future.

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:47.395
In the gamers lies
our salvation.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:52.667
As events like today
continue, the country will

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:55.036
pass my bill willingly.

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.410
To keep guns in games.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:07.548
An army of elite gamers.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.985
Born through with
what we provide.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:15.890
An absolute controlled
militia ready to strike.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:20.828
That, that is the
revolution of today.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:29.470
And that's how we show the world
the potential in our humanity.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:34.876
From time to time, the
tree of Liberty must be

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:40.548
refreshed with the
blood of patriots.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:14.982
This is our wasteland
and what we've made

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:17.185
doesn't have to be like this.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:24.992
Sometimes to make things
better you need to start

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.094
by making them worse.

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:30.598
And I will do that.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.835
I will tear it down.

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.805
I will tear it all down.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:46.481
And then I will rebuild
it brick by brick.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:50.785
So you'll lead this new order?

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:58.659
And you could've been
there, right at my side.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.865
That's bullshit.

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.902
You don't have the right
to control people from

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.771
being assholes and you can't
because we're gonna fuck up.

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:12.807
That's what being human is.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.776
This was never about
saving the wasteland.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:18.112
The wasteland is
inevitable because of who

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:22.183
we are and that's
reality brother.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:25.686
So who's selling who?

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:28.556
This is about you
and no one else.

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:31.259
This is about your greed,
this is about your quest

01:15:31.261 --> 01:15:33.661
to be what only a god can be.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:36.764
Right now I am god.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:42.136
Well you can't control me.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.806
You sure as hell
can't control her.

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:51.312
At the end of it all,
what is this really?

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:57.051
It's about what you don't have,
what you can't have...

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.020
What I have.

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.822
You don't know shit.

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:13.067
You don't think I
saw you coveting her?

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.637
Well no matter what
happens today,

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:22.276
you'll always know that
she chose me over you.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.712
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.147
What are you doing?

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.118
Hey!

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.254
Drop the controller.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:37.625
Drop it.

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:39.627
Drop it right now!

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.929
Hey!

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.699
Drop the controller now!

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.167
No!

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.337
Shit.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:50.204
Shit.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:51.305
Gotcha.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:00.648
Abbie!

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:25.272
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.341
Shit!

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:29.810
Max, what is it?
What's going on?

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.980
Max!

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:47.662
When I come back, you'll
buy me dinner to thank me.

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:48.829
What?

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.097
Max, wait!

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:51.932
Max!

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.782
This ends now.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.503
I'll remember you well.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:15.376
Kincaid!

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.481
Remember why your
friend is dead, Max.

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:25.052
Because of what you're
holding in your hand.

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:30.424
Through me, that'll
never happen again.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.092
Shoot him.

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.531
I know you won't shoot me.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.567
Let's go home.

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:26.213
You're going to our house.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.514
Let's not make a date of it.

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:29.083
Come on, let's go.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:42.029
So if you're just joining us,
I'm here with Max Troy.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:45.266
Champion gamer and former
lead tester for sentinel.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:48.269
After a very bizarre chain
of events that one might

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:51.238
only find in a video
game, the sentinel board

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.943
unanimously voted in this
young man and their new ceo.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.611
You've been fairly silent
since this has all

01:21:57.613 --> 01:22:00.581
happened and we're
all dying to know.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.183
Tell us a little bit about
what happened and what you

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:04.451
have planned.

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:07.488
Well one thing we must
acknowledge as a leader in

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:11.959
this field is our responsibility
to shape our society.

01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:15.129
If you look where we've
come, or arguably where

01:22:15.131 --> 01:22:17.264
we've fallen to, you have
to ask yourself what

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.701
happened to our humanity
and where did it go?

01:22:20.703 --> 01:22:24.672
In my new position, my
focus is to return the

01:22:24.674 --> 01:22:26.607
spotlight to the gamers.

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:29.576
I find that the single
most important thing.

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:31.178
And hopefully if we're
smart enough, we can

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.549
remind our consumers to
engage in balance, to

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:39.386
remember what makes them
human in the first place.

01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:41.388
In between missions of course.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.225
Some of your critics
have voiced concerns.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:47.594
Going as far as to fear
you're gonna fall into the

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.663
same track as your predecessor.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.266
And with such an
unprecedented vote,

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:55.636
some are wondering, I think,
if you almost planned

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:57.338
for this to happen.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.341
Any ambitious man would
dream of reaching the top.

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:03.744
To deny that would deny
my own humanity I think.

01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:07.681
Andrew Kincaid was a god
in his world and any god

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:11.618
who is obsessed with his
own power sets himself up

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.721
for his own demise.

01:23:13.723 --> 01:23:17.758
And that power
falls on his angels.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.161
Someone had to take
up the reigns.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:25.733
All we can do is hope
for a fresh perspective.

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:29.670
Ultimately it's up to us
to enter this world,

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:34.308
to take up that controller,
to make those decisions.

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:37.644
Ultimately, it's your quarter.

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.481
