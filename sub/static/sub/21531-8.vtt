WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:07.375
Will, you have gotta
go shopping.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.409
This cereal is stale.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.611
It doesn't hold milk,
and it tastes horrible.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.713
That is a box
of stuffing mix.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.451
All right,
if this isn't cereal,

00:17.551 --> 00:20.321
then why did it come
with this cool prize I got?

00:20.421 --> 00:23.257
That is a bag of seasoning.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.727
Hey, guys.
There's no chance

00:26.827 --> 00:29.029
my mother's already come
and gone already, is there?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.464
No. She called to say

00:30.564 --> 00:31.732
that her hair appointment's
running long.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.702
Oh. How long
could it take?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.070
Somebody just holds her
by the ankles

00:37.037 --> 00:38.606
and dips her head into
a cotton candy machine.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.275
I love Bobbi.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.711
She's the kind of elderly
person you see on the street

00:43.811 --> 00:46.080
that you don't want
to knock down.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.051
Maybe you don't.
Hmm.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.455
[sing song voice]
Will.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.290
Can you please come out
to lunch with us?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.159
I can't. Remember?

00:58.259 --> 01:00.261
I'm staring my new job
at the Coalition for Justice.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.663
It's exciting because
I'm gonna get to help people.

01:02.763 --> 01:03.831
Also because
the Coalition for Justice

01:03.931 --> 01:06.634
sounds like the kind of place
where superheroes work.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.304
You know? I'm like
the gay Superman.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.507
Waiting to meet
my Louis Lane.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.278
Jack, can you come
with me?

01:17.378 --> 01:20.648
I would love to join
you and Bobbi for lunch.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.584
I don't know why,

01:23.684 --> 01:26.187
but I'm in the mood
for roast turkey.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.625
And a parade.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.663
It's so great
you're coming.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.198
She loves you.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.667
Of course she's always
been obsessed with gay guys.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.370
It's so sad.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.673
Will, I need
something from you.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.774
I'm sorry, Karen.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.410
I literally peed
two minutes ago.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.614
Not that. I'm trying
to teach my staff

01:53.714 --> 01:54.782
how to spot terrorists.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.785
Could you come by
around 3:00

01:57.885 --> 02:00.688
and dash through
the foyer with a backpack?

02:03.557 --> 02:06.794
Can't. Starting my new job
at the Coalition for Justice.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.796
It's a nonprofit
that helps people

02:08.896 --> 02:10.598
that can't afford lawyers.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.466
Oh. Well, honey,
I'm sorry.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.768
You'll find
a real job soon.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.405
It is a real job.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.274
Right.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.810
And this is
my first liver.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.283
I think what Will's doing
is inspirational.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.684
I don't know why,

02:30.784 --> 02:33.687
but I'm feeling
really thankful today.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.791
[yawning]
Is the game on?

02:39.293 --> 02:42.263
[upbeat jazz music]

02:42.363 --> 02:45.299
*

03:01.582 --> 03:04.752
Psst! Psst psst psst!

03:07.488 --> 03:09.790
Okay, look. Before my mother
comes out of the bathroom,

03:09.890 --> 03:12.493
where can we go to lunch
that is really quick?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.194
Oh, I can't wait
till she's the age

03:14.295 --> 03:15.195
where I can
just tell her

03:15.296 --> 03:17.765
we already had lunch
yesterday.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.700
Well, don't you want
to ask Bobbi

03:19.800 --> 03:21.201
where she'd like to go?

03:21.302 --> 03:23.337
She would like to go
to Shrafft's in 1952

03:23.437 --> 03:25.873
and be discovered
by Swifty Lazar.

03:25.973 --> 03:30.911
Grace, you know
I don't speak Jewish.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.547
Oh, that was
embarrassing.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.982
Mmm. But don't worry.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.950
They're in tight now.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.752
[chuckling]

03:38.852 --> 03:39.920
Grace honey,
why don't you hurry up

03:40.020 --> 03:41.589
and change for lunch?

03:43.457 --> 03:44.992
This is what
I'm wearing to lunch.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.760
Oh!

03:46.860 --> 03:50.398
We're going to
the lesbian bar?

03:50.498 --> 03:51.899
We could.

03:51.999 --> 03:55.569
I hear the Honey Bucket
has a great spread.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.479
This is a very nice
outfit, Mom.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.980
This shirt costs
more than your wig.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.484
Oh, well, I like it
'cause it's cheap.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.421
You can throw it
in the dishwasher.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.323
Well, that would
probably explain

04:15.423 --> 04:18.826
this corn
on the cob holder.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.362
Ah!
Here you go.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.365
Can we just go to lunch?

04:24.465 --> 04:25.766
Oh, well,
I hope you take me

04:25.866 --> 04:28.268
someplace nice
for a change.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.703
What does it matter
where we go, Mom?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.038
You're just gonna order
chicken chow mein

04:32.172 --> 04:33.541
and hot water for the tea bag
that's in your purse.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.976
Oh, well, the tea bag
goes in the place

04:36.009 --> 04:37.345
in my wallet
where the pictures

04:37.445 --> 04:39.580
of the grandchildren
usually go.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.556
Welcome. Here's
your desk right here.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.391
Oh. Mission Control.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.494
[chuckles]
So, put me to work.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.463
I'm ready to fight
for the little people.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.697
Take down some bad guys.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.701
Dole out justice
Truman style.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.971
Okay. I'm gonna go grab
your first case.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.478
Whew. That could've
been embarrassing.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.846
Morning.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.952
Oh, yeah. That desk
only has three legs.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.789
It's fine. That's what
I like about nonprofits.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.391
You know, a little rough
around the edges.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.760
Last work I worked,
all the desks had four legs.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.563
[laughing]
Asses.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.399
Here's the file.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.468
Ah. Ooh. Tenant's rights.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.538
"Horrible living conditions.
Brown water.

05:37.638 --> 05:42.376
Rats and roaches." Juicy!

05:42.476 --> 05:46.780
So, what morally bankrupt
monster am I taking down?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.450
Karen Walker.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.787
Yep, that sounds
about right.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.993
Ugh! Thank God she's gone.

06:00.093 --> 06:00.828
All that's left of her

06:00.928 --> 06:05.065
are a few strands
of pink horse hair

06:05.165 --> 06:08.502
and a few flecks
of Polident.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.104
Yeah. Thank God
that's over.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.606
I could not take more
than one lunch

06:12.706 --> 06:13.841
like that a year.

06:13.941 --> 06:14.975
I know. She's
a nightmare, right?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.077
I'm talking about
you, mister!

06:17.177 --> 06:20.047
What?!
I am appalled

06:20.147 --> 06:21.882
by how you treat her.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.986
That woman is
your mother. Mu-ther!

06:26.086 --> 06:27.555
You are so cruel to her.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.490
Me?! What about her?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.792
Did you not hear
her constant insults?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.160
I may have missed a few.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.028
She's gotta learn
to hold for laughs.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.831
But that's not the point.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.034
You need to treasure
her insults while you can.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.736
Because one day
she'll be gone

06:42.836 --> 06:44.071
and you'll have to hear
how much you suck

06:44.171 --> 06:47.541
from her ghost.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.977
You don't know
anything about it.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.681
Oh, my dear.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.749
No one knows how to be
a good daughter

06:55.849 --> 06:57.117
better than a gay son.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.722
The mother of a gay son

07:01.822 --> 07:05.092
learns to accept him
for who he is.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.628
Except for the sex.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.769
The gay son learns
to accept the mother

07:15.869 --> 07:17.605
for who she is.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.139
Except for the sex.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.945
Sadly, mothers and daughters
rarely embark

07:25.045 --> 07:27.981
on this rite of passage.
Thus they are destined

07:28.081 --> 07:30.150
to perpetuate a pattern
of anger and bitchiness.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.854
This would be so much more
clear if I had my slides.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.190
I've seen your slides.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.827
And I don't know
what two Norwegian men

07:39.927 --> 07:42.530
farming naked has to do
with me and my mom.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.198
Grace, if you want
this relationship to change,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.835
you're the one
who has to change it.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.137
Please. Let me help you.

07:50.237 --> 07:54.742
Let me make you
a good gay son.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.010
Except for the sex.

07:57.110 --> 08:01.114
Thanks. But I'll pass.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.015
I'm as gay
as I'd like to be.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.053
This morning when I was
getting dressed

08:06.153 --> 08:10.157
I actually considered
putting a sock in my pants.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.060
Well, you need
something down there.

08:17.665 --> 08:21.569
Jasmine. You have
such beautiful hair.

08:21.669 --> 08:25.038
[chuckles]
I'd like to see it
on my dresser by bedtime.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.009
You know, some people
say "thank you"

08:29.109 --> 08:31.612
when they get a compliment.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.648
I just got another
"help me" note

08:34.748 --> 08:36.049
from one of your maids.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.086
Oh, great. Thanks.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.059
So, I, uh, started
my new job today.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.929
Hmm. That thing where
you save the world

08:49.029 --> 08:51.231
and get paid in soup?
[chuckles]

08:52.299 --> 08:55.202
Doesn't sound like much
of a job to me.

08:56.904 --> 09:00.007
Karen, the work I do
is incredibly important.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.975
I have dedicated my life
to helping those

09:02.075 --> 09:03.944
who cannot help themselves.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.880
You know, since this morning.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.915
And you know,
my first clients,

09:08.015 --> 09:10.083
they live in a rundown
building in Spanish Harlem

09:10.183 --> 09:13.053
that the owner refuses
to bring to code.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.156
Riveting. Why are you here?

09:16.256 --> 09:20.861
Well, because the landlord
is someone we both know.

09:20.961 --> 09:26.166
Oh. I see.

09:26.266 --> 09:30.971
Well, I appreciate
you taking the time

09:31.071 --> 09:33.573
to tell me in person.

09:33.674 --> 09:39.046
So...Marlo Thomas
is a slumlord. Wow.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.016
No, it's not Marlo.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.184
No, no, no!
Let me guess.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.253
It's you, Karen.
I said let me guess.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.688
Is it me?
Yes, it is.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.223
Yay! Woo!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.828
Look, I should be
filing this right now,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.296
but I came down here
to give you a chance

09:56.396 --> 09:58.198
to clear this up
out of court.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.700
I mean the evidence
is overwhelming.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.734
This case is a slam dunk.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.705
Slam dunk!
Shaquille O'Neal!

10:06.173 --> 10:09.242
Okay. I don't know
what that was.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.879
But you have got
to fix this building.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.981
So just sign these papers

10:14.081 --> 10:15.148
agreeing to cover
the costs.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.650
You can make this
whole thing go away.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.887
How do I make
you go away?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.288
You know, years ago

10:21.388 --> 10:23.090
a guy refused
to fix up his building,

10:23.190 --> 10:24.658
and they made him live in.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.726
You know,
and what's worse,

10:25.826 --> 10:26.927
they made a movie
out of it

10:27.027 --> 10:29.162
and they cast Joe Pesci
to play him.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.664
You want Joe Pesci
to play you?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.265
Kiss my A.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.737
I'm sorry.
What did you say

10:36.837 --> 10:40.373
to representative of
Coalition for Justice?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.109
Gosh, I don't know.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.243
Why don't you get
your D out of your ear

10:43.343 --> 10:47.314
and listen to me.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.249
What is the matter
with you?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.784
And why are you
using letters?

10:50.884 --> 10:53.987
Because I'm a lady,
assface.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.792
Okay. That's it.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.360
You've got yourself
a fight.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.831
Take you best shot,
Fairy Mason.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.803
But Karen Walker
is above the law.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.939
You can't touch me!

11:12.039 --> 11:15.175
Oh, oh, oh!

11:15.275 --> 11:17.344
If you go more than 100 feet
from this building,

11:17.444 --> 11:19.112
you will be arrested.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.048
Enjoy your new apartment.

11:30.123 --> 11:36.129
* Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens *

11:36.229 --> 11:37.430
[woman screams]

11:45.105 --> 11:47.207
Hey.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.209
I can't sleep
because I keep thinking

11:49.309 --> 11:52.012
about my relationship
with my mother.

11:52.112 --> 11:56.283
Really? Or is it
because it's only 6:00?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.484
Jack says
I'm horrible to her.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.019
Do you think
I'm horrible to her?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.188
I'll answer that,
but I'm gonna be honest.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.456
Oh, forget it.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.259
What are you up to?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.862
Well, I got big news.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.163
I finally did it.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.365
Today I stuck it
to the Man.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.503
Oh, finally. That was
a long dry spell.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.473
Not that. Karen.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.210
I got the judge
to order her to pay

12:23.310 --> 12:25.178
for all the improvements
to that building she owns.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.782
Oh. That's great.
Good for you.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.984
Yeah, good for the people.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.253
And, uh, I also get him
to sentence her

12:33.353 --> 12:34.154
to live in the building
for a week.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.158
Really? That sounds
kinds of harsh.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.261
It's not harsh, Grace.
It's my job.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.864
I dole out justice
Truman style.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.935
Why can't you just say
you go to work

12:48.035 --> 12:50.070
like everyone else?

12:50.170 --> 12:54.908
I don't say "I dole out
furniture Adler style."

12:55.008 --> 12:57.444
Trust me.
It's the right thing to do.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.246
You know, maybe if she spends
a little time in the building

12:59.346 --> 13:01.481
it'll give her a chance
to really look at herself.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.916
Think about
what she's done.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.152
Have you really
looked at yourself?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.054
What's that supposed
to mean?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.022
I mean,
what are you doing?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.891
You got her to pay
for something

13:10.991 --> 13:13.460
she probably didn't even know
about until you told her.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.395
Why wasn't that enough?

13:15.495 --> 13:18.031
Well, it's complicated.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.333
Doesn't sound complicated.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.269
I mean, you took the job
because you wanted

13:22.369 --> 13:24.171
to become more
compassionate, right?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.305
Yeah, I did.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.340
Then why don't you
start with your friends.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.514
You're right.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.816
I should go down there
and see how she's doing.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.452
You know, dole out some
friendship Truman style.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.324
Is anyone encouraging that?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.229
[door opens]

13:49.329 --> 13:51.298
Okay. I'm ready.
I'll do whatever it takes.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.565
I want to be
a good gay son.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.137
Like Dick Cheney's
daughter.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.571
You're doing
the right thing.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.140
It'll be easy.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.408
All right, now all
you have to do

14:02.475 --> 14:04.277
is not take the bait when
your mother provokes you.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.113
All right?
Now, I'll be Bobbi

14:06.213 --> 14:07.014
and you be you.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.417
And no matter
what I say, don't react.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.253
Just sit there, relax,
and do nothing.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.923
I don't know
that I can do it.

14:16.023 --> 14:16.924
Pretend you're having
sex with a man

14:17.024 --> 14:18.491
just because he bought
you dinner.
Got it.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.394
Okay. All right.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.196
Now, ahem.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.198
I'm gonna start,
all right?

14:25.298 --> 14:28.268
[exhales]
I'm becoming Bobbi Adler.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
I'm finding the voice.
[hums]

14:31.138 --> 14:32.940
I'm imagining
the Jane Russell 18-hour bra

14:33.040 --> 14:35.976
with the safety pin
instead of the hook.

14:36.076 --> 14:40.013
The inexplicably
good legs.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.215
And I'm Bobbi.
Aah!

14:46.353 --> 14:47.887
Grace, focus!

14:47.988 --> 14:50.657
Now remember,
no matter what I say,

14:50.757 --> 14:53.193
don't react. Okay?

14:53.293 --> 14:57.164
Here we go. Ahem.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.299
Darling, you chased away
your husband

14:59.399 --> 15:01.034
and apparently
your colorist.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.502
That is not fair--
Ah, ah, ah!

15:02.602 --> 15:05.438
I am your mother.
Don't take the bait.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.307
I can say or do anything
I want.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.176
Like this.
Ow! You bitch!

15:09.276 --> 15:11.178
Hey, hey! Do not react.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.013
Keep it inside.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.281
Gonna hit your mother?
Gonna take the bait?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.448
Sit up straight.
Shade your hair.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.417
Date a straight guy.
Find a man, find a man.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.354
Aah! Aah!

15:36.703 --> 15:40.407
I think I might need
to do this a few more times.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.343
All right, Grace.
I've had it with you.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.479
You are unteachable!
And you ruined my wig!

15:46.579 --> 15:49.282
I don't even know if these
curls are resetable.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.985
Oh, great.
The netting's torn!

15:52.085 --> 15:53.653
Oh, would you just relax?

15:53.753 --> 15:57.057
Those are six bucks
for a dozen at The Whig Easy.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.492
This is an Ava Gabor!

15:59.592 --> 16:02.462
It is irreplaceable!

16:02.562 --> 16:04.131
All right, I am gonna
tell you something

16:04.231 --> 16:07.400
I've heard from my own mother
my whole life.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.470
"Put down that Barbie."

16:10.570 --> 16:15.175
No. You're being an idiot.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.446
So what if she
insults you? Who cares?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.314
The bottom line is
she loves you.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.050
Well, why can't she act
like she does?

16:23.150 --> 16:26.053
She does.
Every day of your life

16:26.153 --> 16:28.621
when she shatters your ego
and makes you feel like nothing

16:28.721 --> 16:32.192
it comes
from a place of love.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.097
Oh, that's sweet.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.532
Twisted, but sweet.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.703
[exhales]

16:45.505 --> 16:46.606
Karen, it's Will.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.475
(Karen)
Go away!

16:48.575 --> 16:50.677
Come on. Open up.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.545
I dropped my rubber gloves
in a puddle of pee

16:52.645 --> 16:55.382
and I can't open doors
with my elbows.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.384
What do you want?
Get in here.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.420
Oh. Well, your timing
could not be worse.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.654
I'm right in the middle
of a game.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.125
Marisol, Concepcion,
this is Will.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.094
The maricon
I told you about.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.097
Oh. Hola, señor.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.466
She asked if you know
Elton John.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.638
And then she said you look
like a big mincing queen.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.608
Such an efficient language.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.477
Ladies, why don't you
take your cigars

17:24.577 --> 17:27.247
and go up to the roof?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.715
You can touch my mink
one more time

17:28.815 --> 17:31.318
on your way out.
There you go.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.286
Okay. All righty.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.557
Karen, I want to apologize

17:37.657 --> 17:39.459
for putting you
through all this.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.528
What are you
talking about? I'm fine.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.696
I've got everything
I need. A can opener.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.599
A terlet that's not
connected to anything.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.668
And all the lead paint
I can eat.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.608
Look, you don't have to
put on a brave face for me.

17:55.708 --> 17:59.446
Even though I'm sure
it cost you a fortune.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.581
I know that this has
gotta be

18:01.681 --> 18:03.450
a difficult adjustment
for you.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.286
Jorge! Your mother
has been looking for you

18:06.386 --> 18:07.387
for three hours!

18:07.487 --> 18:10.089
Consiga su asno
adentro aqui!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.628
And yet when you
talk to Rosario,

18:15.728 --> 18:18.398
it's, "Scrub-o the tub-o."

18:19.899 --> 18:23.236
The point is...

18:23.336 --> 18:24.537
It's my fault
you're here.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.640
I didn't have to
take it this far.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.543
Then why did you?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.679
I don't know.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.282
I tried to help you,
and then you...

18:35.382 --> 18:37.384
made fun of my job, and I--

18:37.484 --> 18:38.651
You just pushed
my buttons.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.754
Well, isn't this funny?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.756
You know, if anybody
had asked me,

18:43.856 --> 18:47.594
I would've said that
you were pushing my buttons.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.496
Really?
Yes.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.631
I would've written
that check right away

18:51.731 --> 18:54.334
if you hadn't come in
all high and mighty.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.670
Acting all mighty
when I was high.

19:00.707 --> 19:04.677
So we both behaved badly
out of pettiness and spite.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.647
Yeah. And maybe
a little roid rage.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.622
Oh. Honey,
why do we do it?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.490
Why are we always
at each other?

19:17.590 --> 19:20.693
[chuckles]
Can you imagine
what Nora Ephron

19:20.793 --> 19:23.363
would do
with our story?

19:23.463 --> 19:26.833
No. Although I'm sure
it would feel familiar.

19:26.933 --> 19:31.271
And we could sleep
through most of it.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.839
Look, I'm gonna
make a call.

19:32.939 --> 19:33.873
I'm gonna get you
out of this.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.542
No, no, no, honey.
That's okay.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.411
I'll finish out my week.
It'll be good for me.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.547
Anyway,
thanks for stopping by.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.350
I'm gonna run up to the roof
and meet the girls.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.684
Mind if I keep you
company for a bit?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.553
Well, no. I'd like that.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.488
But, you know, just to be
on the safe side,

19:48.588 --> 19:51.190
let's talk real loudly
about how your dad's black.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.432
How's the chow mein?
Do you want some more?

19:59.532 --> 20:05.338
I was just distracted
by your garish eye shadow.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.207
Do you really need
three colors?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.343
Mom, this is not
garish. It--

20:16.716 --> 20:19.652
Why are you smiling?

20:19.752 --> 20:23.823
Are my boobs
under my arms again?

20:26.793 --> 20:30.763
No, Mom.
Well, yes, but--

20:30.863 --> 20:35.001
No, I'm--

20:36.469 --> 20:39.606
I'm smiling because...

20:39.706 --> 20:41.874
whatever you say to me,
I know you love me.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.611
Well, of course I do,
darling. I adore you.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.913
That's what I thought.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.815
It's just like
when you say

20:48.915 --> 20:51.851
I'm too old
to play Juliet,

20:51.951 --> 20:55.888
I know it's just your way
of saying you love me.

20:59.526 --> 21:02.729
Yeah, that's exactly
what I mean.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.865
You're so sweet.
I love you.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.734
Ow.
Oh. Ow.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.001
Oh, I found the other one.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.137
