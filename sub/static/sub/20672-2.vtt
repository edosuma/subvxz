00:09.410 --> 00:12.146
Acronix and Krux,
the Hands Of Time?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.447
[grunting]

00:16.450 --> 00:18.319
I've encountered
one of you before.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.154
You've met my father?

[whirring]

00:49.750 --> 00:51.719
[instrumental music]

00:57.125 --> 00:58.159
slurp

00:58.192 --> 00:59.493
Aah..

00:59.527 --> 01:01.495
Another cup please, Misako.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.166
Okay.
But drink it slower this time.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.169
Healing tea doesn't work
on a burnt tongue.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.337
slurp

01:09.370 --> 01:12.206
Sip. You are quite impatient.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.609
[chuckles]
The same could be said of them.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.845
Okay, Master Wu,
you've had your tea.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.580
Now can we talk?

01:19.613 --> 01:22.350
- Ask any question you wish.
- Who did we fight in the mona--

01:22.383 --> 01:23.651
- That was Acronix.
- From the painting?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.653
- Twins look alike.
- Or was it Krux?

01:25.686 --> 01:27.521
- Is he from the future?
- How did he speed up time?

01:27.555 --> 01:29.757
- Was he from the past?
- Who ate my pudding cup?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.895
What? He said ask any question.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.530
I put my name on this.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.332
Just because we're in a new dojo

01:38.366 --> 01:41.335
doesn't mean we disobey
the refrigerator rules!

01:43.771 --> 01:45.506
Right. Sorry.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.342
Guy in monastery.
What's his story?

01:48.376 --> 01:51.879
Oh, to answer that,
I must begin at the end.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.747
It was 40 years ago

01:53.781 --> 01:56.650
shortly
after the Serpentine Wars.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.288
When I was a much younger man.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.623
[screaming]

02:10.331 --> 02:13.201
As you know,
we fought valiantly.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.735
But our enemies were strong

02:14.768 --> 02:17.505
and our powers alone
were not enough.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.275
It was the discovery
of the magic flutes

02:21.309 --> 02:25.613
that allowed us to finally
defeat the Anacondrai.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.715
Their leaders were banished

02:27.748 --> 02:31.552
and peace was returned
to Ninjago.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.188
It is done, Brother Garmadon.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.723
Indeed, Wu.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.759
Today Ninjago
is finally at peace.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.396
A great victory, and one
we could not have achieved

02:42.430 --> 02:46.300
without each of you,
the Elemental Masters.

02:46.334 --> 02:50.304
Smoke, metal, lightning, shadow

02:50.338 --> 02:54.508
'fire, water and time!'

02:54.542 --> 02:55.876
(Cole)
Now, hold on a sec.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.611
So that guy at the monastery

02:57.645 --> 03:00.514
is an actual
Elemental Master of time?

03:00.548 --> 03:05.519
No, Acronix was
an Elemental Master of time..

03:05.553 --> 03:07.788
...like his brother, Krux.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.693
After helping us win
our hard-fought peace

03:12.726 --> 03:16.230
they betrayed me,
Garmadon, and the others.

03:16.264 --> 03:19.367
The so-called Hands Of Time
felt they controlled

03:19.400 --> 03:20.701
the most powerful element

03:20.734 --> 03:23.871
therefore entitling them to rule
all of Ninjago.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.007
- What did you do?
- We had to stop them.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.942
And it would take all of us.

03:28.976 --> 03:34.582
'Garmadon, myself,
and every Elemental Master.

03:34.615 --> 03:38.786
- Even...our parents?
- Of course.

03:38.819 --> 03:43.324
Kai, Nya, your mother and father
were great fighters

03:43.357 --> 03:46.527
but it appears even they
had met their match.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.696
Acronix was a skilled warrior.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.798
One of the best I've ever seen.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.734
But his real power
was his ability to control

03:53.767 --> 03:55.736
the forward movement of time.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.771
By sending himself forward

03:57.805 --> 03:59.707
he was always ahead
of the action.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.975
As if he had super speed.

04:03.844 --> 04:04.578
[Acronix laughing]

04:04.612 --> 04:07.014
However, a slow progression

04:07.047 --> 04:08.982
can be just as dangerous.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.760
Different power,
but equally effective.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.764
One master of time
was bad enough

04:23.797 --> 04:27.401
but like the hands on a clock,
there were two.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.371
Hyah!

04:30.404 --> 04:32.540
[grunting]

04:38.546 --> 04:40.548
[grunting]

04:44.685 --> 04:47.521
[grunts]

04:47.555 --> 04:50.891
Krux's power was
the opposite of his brother's.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.861
He could reverse time.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.431
It's a huge advantage
in combat.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.667
Know your opponent's next move.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.835
Know how to counteract it.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.677
He could even control time
to the point of halting it.

05:09.710 --> 05:13.013
Of course,
he didn't halt himself.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.051
They're unbeatable, brother.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.688
- How do we stop them?
- I don't know.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.824
Time is the thread that sews
the fabric of the universe.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.427
And it appears that
they have all the needles.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.963
- Control time..
- Control everything.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.832
[both laughing]

05:33.066 --> 05:35.369
(Wu)
We knew we had to prepare.

05:35.403 --> 05:39.072
Fearing that next time
we would not be so lucky.

05:42.443 --> 05:46.747
The wait is over.
The future has arrived.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.384
The BorgWatch,
launching today.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.885
Incredible.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.856
A wall-mounted window
for displaying 30-second dramas!

05:55.889 --> 05:59.460
Those dramas
are called commercials.

05:59.493 --> 06:03.030
Cynical films playing off
consumers' insecurities

06:03.063 --> 06:07.000
to convince them to purchase
that which they do not need.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.136
So cool.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.904
I am jealous, brother.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.775
You got to experience
the last 40 years of progress.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.177
Hot beverages
at the touch of a button.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.146
A beadless abacus.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.415
Instant communication.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.817
Worthless! All of it.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.852
[exhaling]

06:24.885 --> 06:28.088
I absolutely despise
modern life.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.691
But it's filled
with wondrous things

06:30.724 --> 06:33.694
we couldn't have even
conceived of 40 years ago.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.463
Like this amazing thing.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.532
A BorgPad. Vile contraption.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.601
I got it
at the museum gift shop.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.771
A piece of glass
that performs music.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.105
* Ninjago *

06:45.138 --> 06:48.742
Creates a permanent visual
record of any event.

06:50.043 --> 06:50.978
There's even games!

06:51.011 --> 06:55.115
I hate those infernal devices
most of all.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.818
Everyone perpetually plugged in.

06:57.851 --> 07:02.189
Distracted like infants
by bright lights and sound.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.024
Yes! Smashed all the candy.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.693
[growls]

07:07.227 --> 07:10.598
You said the Hands Of Time
were unbeatable.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.933
Yet you beat them. How?

07:12.966 --> 07:15.803
The way one
often defeats an enemy.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.771
By taking away their weapon.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.708
- But their weapon was time.
- Indeed.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.844
[crows cawing]

07:25.779 --> 07:29.116
- Are they done?
- They are.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.551
Here they come!

07:30.584 --> 07:32.720
(Wu)
Our only hope was four blades..

07:32.753 --> 07:36.189
...hastily forged
from chrono-steel.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.025
The Time Blades.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.730
[grunting]

07:47.968 --> 07:49.737
[grunting]

08:09.557 --> 08:11.759
[grunting]

08:16.997 --> 08:18.766
[grunts]

08:25.172 --> 08:26.940
[screaming]

08:30.644 --> 08:32.112
Who-a-a!

08:33.113 --> 08:34.748
[grunts]

08:35.315 --> 08:36.584
[screaming]

08:36.617 --> 08:38.018
[groans]

08:51.599 --> 08:53.100
clank

08:56.737 --> 08:59.139
[dramatic music]

08:59.172 --> 09:01.141
[both screaming]

09:01.174 --> 09:02.843
(Wu)
Chrono-steel is the only metal

09:02.876 --> 09:05.212
that can absorb
elemental energy.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.749
Stripped off their powers,
Acronix and Krux

09:08.782 --> 09:11.184
were just two ordinary men.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.786
Easily subdued.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.656
But the ability to control time
is too great

09:15.689 --> 09:17.591
for anyone to possess.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.728
Garmadon and I knew
the Time Blades themselves

09:20.761 --> 09:25.032
were a threat that had to be
eliminated...forever.

09:25.065 --> 09:29.136
We created a temporal vortex
to dispatch the blades in time

09:29.169 --> 09:32.039
where they would be
lost to the ages.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.679
But Acronix and Krux
refused to admit defeat.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.883
They thought they were
more powerful than time itself.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.255
So what happened to them?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.224
Krux disappeared
into time itself.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.394
And I knew Acronix
was going to return yesterday.

09:54.427 --> 09:59.399
So I waited. He was the
remaining loose end to tie.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.869
Now, he is no more.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.971
You mean, like, permanently?

10:04.004 --> 10:07.841
Never my intent,
but it was his fate.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.377
Now, Acronix is gone forever.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.846
Along with that Time Blade.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.381
It took four decades

10:14.414 --> 10:18.686
but the Hands Of Time will
never again threaten Ninjago.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.220
One question.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.289
How did you know Acronix
was going to return

10:22.322 --> 10:24.725
to the monastery
at that exact moment?

10:24.758 --> 10:27.127
- Why didn't you ask for help?
- How many Elemental Masters--

10:27.160 --> 10:28.929
- Will they make Time Blades?
- Our parents.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.064
You said they were there.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.066
[snoring]

10:33.100 --> 10:35.335
No more questions for today.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.938
Your master fought
a powerful enemy.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.373
He needs time to recuperate.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.943
Hey, I just realized..

10:42.976 --> 10:45.012
The mural we saw at the museum.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.247
That must be the battle
Wu just told us about.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.350
But Dr. Saunders said
the Hands Of Time were a myth.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.020
History is art, not science.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.055
Even an expert
such as Dr. Saunders

10:55.088 --> 10:56.790
can be mistaken
from time to time.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.158
Hah! True that.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.461
Know how I know? 'Cause Acronix
was a so-called myth.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.230
And we totally busted him.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.699
- Ha ha!
- Yeah! Ha ha ha.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.802
Except now
there's nothing to do.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.807
Hmm? The temple
still needs unpacking.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.043
[sighs]
Lloyd's right.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.880
Uh, kinda wish
we hadn't busted him.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.282
- Hey, Nya, wanna hang out?
- Hmm.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.320
Uh, uh. Ah, yeah.
Slice that fruit.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.023
Hey!

11:30.057 --> 11:31.358
What's with the get-up?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.027
Soon, we shall return Ninjago

11:34.061 --> 11:36.764
to its pre-modern glory.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.399
Yes. Hah! I like that.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.903
It's not for us.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.974
[intense music]

11:49.342 --> 11:51.745
When I asked
if you wanted to hang out

11:51.779 --> 11:53.947
I meant play video games
or something

11:53.981 --> 11:57.417
not pack and ship your
Samurai X suit back to the cave.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.223
[sighs]
You gotta let it go.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.358
You're the Water Ninja now.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.861
I know, but it's hard.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.097
I only inherited my water power.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.867
Samurai X is something
I actually created

12:13.901 --> 12:15.502
with my own hands.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.137
These hands?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.141
Whoa! Sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.475
Hah, I didn't see anything.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.778
- What's up?
- Something you need to see.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.246
Hurry! Ah!

12:26.279 --> 12:27.881
[groaning]

12:27.915 --> 12:30.117
That's why I camped out
all night

12:30.150 --> 12:32.786
I never miss a Borg Store
product debut.

12:32.820 --> 12:37.124
BorgPad, BorgPod,
I even brought the Cyrus PDA.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.327
I guess you could say
I'm the company's Borg-est fan.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.929
[laughing]

12:41.962 --> 12:43.831
Borg-est, heh? Get it?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.998
[laughing]

12:45.032 --> 12:48.001
Uh, anyway, I'm pretty excited.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.503
[upbeat music]

12:50.537 --> 12:53.473
[cheering]

12:57.210 --> 13:01.181
Uh, not so long ago,
if you wanted to tell time

13:01.214 --> 13:06.019
you had to look to the sun,
or a clock, or your wristwatch

13:06.053 --> 13:07.821
'or ask a friend..'

13:07.855 --> 13:09.356
The-the point is

13:09.389 --> 13:12.159
there had to be
a better solution.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.462
Something merging
advanced electronics.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.898
And there is.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.966
[music continues]

13:18.999 --> 13:20.100
[music stops]

13:20.133 --> 13:22.469
Today, I am proud to announce..

13:22.502 --> 13:24.171
[upbeat music]

13:24.204 --> 13:28.909
[music stops]
...that we are
changing time itself.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.378
I present to you..

13:34.014 --> 13:35.482
[upbeat music]

13:35.515 --> 13:38.085
'...the BorgWatch.'

13:38.118 --> 13:40.120
[all clamoring]

13:40.153 --> 13:43.456
Uh, really not the reaction
we were going for.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.496
That was the scene just
moments ago in downtown Ninjago

13:49.529 --> 13:51.364
where the launch
of the new BorgWatch

13:51.398 --> 13:53.566
was tragically marred
by a samurai.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.304
Well, Kai, you said
there was nothing left to do.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.340
And ninja-ing
certainly beats unpacking.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.375
Eh, actually
anything beats unpacking.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.145
Yeah, too bad
there's only one samurai.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.114
They don't really need
all of us.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.616
So, how do we decide
who gets to deal with this?

14:09.649 --> 14:13.386
I suggest randomly assigning
each of ourselves a digit.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.423
Then manually engaging a cube
with graphical representations

14:16.456 --> 14:20.360
of each number to make
a random, unbiased selection.

14:20.393 --> 14:24.264
- Roll dice.
- Yeah. Or..

14:24.297 --> 14:26.099
We could just see
who gets there first.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.001
(all)
Race you!

14:28.501 --> 14:30.270
[dramatic music]

14:40.247 --> 14:42.983
- Even the normally un--
- Aah!

14:43.016 --> 14:45.152
Wow. It's chaos here.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.487
I've never seen
such destruction.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.990
Well, okay, I have,
but i-it's been a while

14:50.023 --> 14:52.359
and you never
really get used to it.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.527
Hey! You messed with
the wrong purveyor

14:54.561 --> 14:57.297
of high quality consumer goods,
hombre.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.133
'Cause this Borg Store
is friends with me

15:00.167 --> 15:01.634
the Brown Ninja.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.604
Drop the laptop.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.173
Aah! You animal!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.375
I didn't mean literally!

15:12.712 --> 15:14.614
Oh, what's happening down there?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.484
The man in the brown jumpsuit
is crying

15:17.517 --> 15:20.253
and our vermilion warrior
has picked him up

15:20.287 --> 15:24.291
is holding him over his head
and.. Oh!

15:24.324 --> 15:27.027
Brown jumpsuit's
gonna feel that in the morning.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.329
I meant Cyrus Borg!

15:29.362 --> 15:31.431
Our warrior
is supposed to kidnap him.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.334
- Patience. He will.
- When?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.004
It's like you ordered him
to destroy the Borg Store first

15:37.037 --> 15:39.439
then grab Borg.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.541
You did, didn't you?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.310
Mm.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.081
[tires screeching]

15:48.115 --> 15:49.749
We got here
at the exact same time.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.451
Oh, darn.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.054
Now how do we decide
who gets to fight?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.755
Is that Dareth?
Well, maybe he'll--

15:55.788 --> 15:57.590
[Dareth screaming]

15:57.624 --> 16:00.027
[groaning]

16:00.060 --> 16:02.562
(Dareth)
Dude, sup?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.464
I roughed him up for you

16:04.497 --> 16:08.068
but feel free
to finish the guy off.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.302
[crowd screaming]

16:09.336 --> 16:12.005
Hey, Zane,
you still have those dice?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.206
I have virtual ones.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.674
[beeping]

16:14.707 --> 16:16.343
- Kai.
- Yeah!

16:16.376 --> 16:17.710
Hoo-hoo!

16:17.744 --> 16:20.580
Wait! Aren't you gonna
draw your sword?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.415
I'm good, sis.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.552
Okay, I don't wanna brag,
but the other day

16:25.585 --> 16:29.356
I helped stop, like,
an Elemental Master of time.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.359
So I think I can handle
one lousy s--

16:32.392 --> 16:34.527
(Kai)
Whoa!

16:34.561 --> 16:38.065
[Kai groaning]
'Who's next?'

16:38.098 --> 16:39.099
[beeping]

16:39.132 --> 16:40.767
- Zane.
- Oh, come on.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.369
That was totally rigged.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.171
We didn't even see the roll.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.173
[Zane screaming]

16:46.206 --> 16:47.640
thud

16:51.411 --> 16:54.281
You guys got this? Good.

16:55.748 --> 17:00.187
Hang on, guys, there's something
I've been wanting to try again.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.190
Oh, what,
that Earth punch thing?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.525
Like it worked so well
last time.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.360
No problem.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.634
[hissing]

17:14.667 --> 17:15.802
Whoa.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.237
- Gross.
- You..

17:17.270 --> 17:19.739
You totally disintegrated him!

17:19.772 --> 17:22.442
Uh, i-it was an accident.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.610
Look!

17:23.643 --> 17:25.312
[hissing]

17:33.153 --> 17:36.256
[laughing]

17:36.856 --> 17:40.627
Whoa. Eww. Grosser!

17:40.660 --> 17:43.663
Come on, team.
We've done this before.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.833
There's more than one way
to stop a snake.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.502
(all)
Ninjago!

17:49.536 --> 17:51.438
[groaning]

17:59.612 --> 18:03.550
I'm starting to think we might
have underestimated this guy.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.253
(Zane)
It certainly appears so.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.855
[laughing]

18:08.888 --> 18:11.624
You said there was more
than one way to stop a snake.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.660
Which one do you
want to try now?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.662
Um, any of them?

18:19.632 --> 18:21.801
It must be after Cyrus Borg!

18:21.834 --> 18:26.473
It worked!
He's practically unstoppable.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.607
Yes.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.443
Although I hadn't expected
the ninja.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.845
Good thing we have
reinforcements.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.847
[shattering]

18:34.881 --> 18:36.783
[hissing]

18:44.491 --> 18:45.592
Go!

18:46.726 --> 18:48.595
Uh..

18:48.628 --> 18:50.263
[gasps]

18:51.198 --> 18:53.766
[growling]

18:53.800 --> 18:58.271
[grunting]
Okay, big guy,
that's as far as you go.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.640
Whoa! Ah!

19:00.673 --> 19:02.542
[laughing]

19:06.346 --> 19:09.282
Cyrus Borg!
Zane, get him out of here.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.483
We'll deal with the samurai.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.252
But you'll need
my battle skills.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.354
(P.I.X.A.L)
Zane, my creator needs you too.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.622
[growling]

19:15.655 --> 19:16.689
Uh..

19:17.490 --> 19:19.926
Right this way, doctor.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.895
(Acronix)
The Ice Ninja is trying
to get Borg to safety.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.431
Good.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.733
[clamoring]

19:30.903 --> 19:32.772
[screaming]

19:37.410 --> 19:38.878
[laughing]

19:48.755 --> 19:50.390
Hey! Uh..

19:54.994 --> 19:56.829
[Dareth screaming]

19:56.863 --> 19:59.832
[grunting]

20:11.278 --> 20:13.380
Oh, no, you don't.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.681
[squealing]

20:16.483 --> 20:18.385
That's it!

20:20.487 --> 20:22.989
What are those things, and..

20:23.022 --> 20:24.691
...and what do they want
with me?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.694
I don't know,
but we will find out.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.596
[gasping]

20:29.629 --> 20:32.031
Uh, well,
this is a surprise.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.867
I didn't expect to see you.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.836
Who didn't you--

20:36.869 --> 20:38.905
[clamoring]

20:41.874 --> 20:44.010
Guys, I know how
to stop these things!

20:44.043 --> 20:46.279
We gotta keep these things
from getting back

20:46.313 --> 20:47.680
into the armor and reforming.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.482
No kidding. Any idea how?

20:49.516 --> 20:51.651
Nya, use your water power.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.855
No good! Those snakes can swim.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.591
[laughing]
Not in this pool!

21:02.762 --> 21:06.299
[chuckles]
Look, guys,
electric eels.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.668
Oh, come on.
That was a good one.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.504
(Nya)
Look, it's working!

21:11.538 --> 21:14.874
Oh, and I thought
unpacking was tiring.

21:14.907 --> 21:18.378
- Nice job. They're gone.
- 'For now.'

21:18.411 --> 21:21.481
I wonder.. Who were they?

21:21.514 --> 21:24.717
Good question.
Zane, can you analyze?

21:24.751 --> 21:27.587
Oh, right. He's with Cyrus Borg.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.022
Come on. Let's go get them.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.063
- Zane?
- It's safe.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.765
You can come out now.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.967
- Mr. Borg?
- Zane?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.702
- 'Zane?'
- Hey.

21:42.735 --> 21:47.073
Cyrus Borg's BorgWatch,
but no Cyrus Borg.

21:47.106 --> 21:51.411
- Huh? Zane!
- Oh, no.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.913
[gasping]
No! Zane!

21:54.781 --> 21:57.484
[hissing]

22:04.757 --> 22:09.429
The first run was a success.
But we lost much of our armor.

22:09.462 --> 22:12.899
I already have
my best blacksmiths on it.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.101
Will they be able
to make enough to suit up

22:15.134 --> 22:16.836
the remaining serpents?

22:16.869 --> 22:21.073
Oh, I have much bigger plans.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.547
[dramatic music]

22:35.187 --> 22:36.656
[glass shattering]

22:37.490 --> 22:39.792
[hissing]

22:41.561 --> 22:44.664
[theme music]
