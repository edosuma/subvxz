00:24.446 --> 00:26.414
One contest...
- Jon, one song...

00:26.581 --> 00:28.173
Trust me.
- Hit the fucking brakes.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.580
This place looks sweet.
- I'll get the boards.

00:30.752 --> 00:32.481
That's my boy.
- Yeah, fuck you.

00:32.654 --> 00:35.248
Hey. Who is this guy?
- Some freak from Santa Clara.

00:35.424 --> 00:37.358
- Don't worry about him.
- Who gives a fuck?

00:37.526 --> 00:39.926
No, I'm not worried about it,
I'm just saying.

00:40.095 --> 00:43.030
Listen, man, this is fucking America,
man, not fucking Zimbabwe.

00:43.198 --> 00:45.029
Zimbabwe? Yo, fucking Caribbean, bitch.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.600
How many times I gotta remind you?
Kiss my ass.

00:47.769 --> 00:49.532
Yo, leave this motherfucker here, man.

00:49.705 --> 00:52.333
I'll drive Miss Daisy,
I'll drive your ass home, bitch.

00:52.507 --> 00:54.304
Drive this surfboard right up your...

00:54.476 --> 00:56.410
Let's go.
- We're breaking in!

00:56.578 --> 00:58.307
Hey. Keep it down.
- Shut up!

00:58.480 --> 01:00.038
- Shut up!
- Why, are you scared?

01:00.215 --> 01:01.409
Yeah. Yeah, I'm scared.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.813
- Don't drop my board or I'll cut your throat.
- Take this, Aryan bitch.

01:04.986 --> 01:09.150
I don't know where you found this
swastika-waving wannabe skinhead.

01:09.324 --> 01:11.292
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Fucking psycho.

01:55.203 --> 01:57.467
Wait till you see the reaction on his face.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.072
Yo, it's corn-fed, fucking...

01:59.241 --> 02:02.142
What the fuck are you doing
on my beach?

02:02.310 --> 02:04.801
What you say, fussy?
You're too red-eyed.

02:04.980 --> 02:09.076
You don't run this thing.
You run your pussy-whore blood-clot.

02:11.686 --> 02:13.415
He says that you don't own the ocean.

02:13.889 --> 02:15.516
Is that a fact?

02:15.690 --> 02:17.453
Let me tell you something.

02:17.626 --> 02:20.789
I own every drop of water
between here and the lighthouse...

02:20.962 --> 02:23.226
...as well as the sand
and everything on it.

02:23.899 --> 02:27.528
Which I guess now includes you.

02:32.707 --> 02:34.174
Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

02:34.342 --> 02:36.572
Why don't you just blow me,
you old fuck?

02:38.246 --> 02:41.147
Hey. Take it easy, man.
We're done here, anyway.

02:41.316 --> 02:45.446
Uh-uh. We're just getting started.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.713
- Jesus.
- We jumped your gate, it's not like...

02:47.889 --> 02:49.584
...we went for a swim in your pool.

02:49.758 --> 02:53.216
- We'd never go into anyone's house.
- Unless we were invited.

03:14.049 --> 03:15.607
Hey.

03:16.218 --> 03:17.617
Make sure you take the head.

03:27.329 --> 03:29.889
Yo. Suck my dick, bitch.

03:30.065 --> 03:32.363
Hey, Shane. Check this out.

03:34.069 --> 03:35.866
Ow. Fucking...

03:37.005 --> 03:39.439
I think I hit the spine.

03:40.842 --> 03:43.402
Oh, you son of a bitch.

03:43.578 --> 03:45.307
You fucking...

03:45.480 --> 03:47.209
Clear the shot.

03:47.649 --> 03:50.447
There you go.
You ain't talking shit now, you bitch.

06:04.786 --> 06:06.811
Not bad, right?

06:08.990 --> 06:12.426
Not bad, not bad.

06:13.795 --> 06:16.320
Not bad at all.

06:17.165 --> 06:19.292
Right, little sister?

06:23.838 --> 06:25.465
Thank you.

06:25.807 --> 06:28.970
- Told you this was gonna work out.
- Yeah? Then where's the sun?

06:29.144 --> 06:31.044
The sun's overrated.

06:31.212 --> 06:32.839
Gives you wrinkles.

06:33.014 --> 06:34.174
- Chris.
- Come on.

06:34.349 --> 06:35.475
Get out.

06:36.718 --> 06:39.084
Be nice.
- I'm always nice.

06:39.254 --> 06:41.188
You're the one with the temper.

06:41.356 --> 06:43.415
Now, see? That wasn't nice.

06:44.859 --> 06:46.588
You're such an ass.
- Yup.

06:47.962 --> 06:49.054
<i>Coming.</i>

06:50.632 --> 06:53.328
- Oh, my goodness, look at you.
- Hi. Hey, Aunt Jillian.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.765
I wasn't expecting you for ages,
you're so early.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.700
We didn't know how long it would take.

06:57.872 --> 06:59.863
The last time I saw you,
you were this high.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.702
- I drank my milk.
- Come here.

07:01.876 --> 07:04.071
You drank your milk, you silly...

07:05.513 --> 07:08.277
And Nicole, come here. Come here.

07:08.450 --> 07:09.815
Let me look at you.

07:09.984 --> 07:12.282
You're so beautiful. You...

07:12.454 --> 07:14.615
You look so much like your mom.

07:14.789 --> 07:18.054
- It's totally blowing my mind.
- Thanks.

07:19.861 --> 07:21.795
I'm sorry.

07:23.031 --> 07:25.056
I'm so sorry that I didn't...

07:25.233 --> 07:27.133
- That's okay, Aunt Jillian.
- Didn't know...

07:27.302 --> 07:28.428
Aunt Jillian.

07:28.603 --> 07:30.503
- Thank you.
- Look at me.

07:31.406 --> 07:33.897
Let's get you guys situated.

07:34.075 --> 07:37.135
So this is what we call in the business
"a diamond in the rough."

07:37.312 --> 07:42.579
It's got great bones,
but it could use a little sprucing up.

07:43.151 --> 07:44.550
There we go.

07:44.719 --> 07:47.586
So there's the kitchen over there
and some storage over there.

07:47.755 --> 07:50.781
Sleeping space here, living...
Come this way.

07:50.959 --> 07:52.153
Half-bath through there...

07:52.327 --> 07:56.058
...and it creates a very nice
rustic-y charm, feng-shui-type flow...

07:56.231 --> 07:58.324
...that leads us straight out to... Come on.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.730
- this out to here.

08:00.902 --> 08:02.961
There we go. Ta-da!

08:03.138 --> 08:04.537
Beautiful.

08:04.706 --> 08:06.503
Just watch that step there.

08:06.674 --> 08:08.767
So lots of fresh air...

08:08.943 --> 08:10.774
Scat. Scat.

08:10.945 --> 08:12.776
Just ignore the old guy.

08:12.947 --> 08:15.780
I was thinking 650 a month,
how does that sound?

08:15.950 --> 08:16.974
<i>Six- fifty?</i>

08:17.152 --> 08:20.781
I know, I know. I could be getting
at least 800, but what am I gonna do?

08:20.955 --> 08:22.946
Charge you guys full price?
You're family.

08:24.192 --> 08:26.160
Well, it sounds good.

08:26.327 --> 08:29.854
It is so great having you both here.

08:32.567 --> 08:35.660
Here's the keys.
Remember, Jillian with a J.

08:42.544 --> 08:45.513
I thought she was gonna let us
stay here for free.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.308
Well, yeah. So did I.

08:49.817 --> 08:52.411
Does this even work?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.

08:52.587 --> 08:55.784
- Plug it in, dust it off.
- It doesn't work.

08:56.090 --> 08:58.752
Hey, Nicole. Check this out.

09:00.628 --> 09:02.357
Oh, my God.

09:03.097 --> 09:06.794
We're gonna put this up right now.
These have got to go up.

09:06.968 --> 09:08.993
It's a safety hazard.

09:09.170 --> 09:12.367
Right there on that nail, right there.
- Oh, oh, wait. There?

09:14.008 --> 09:16.533
Now this place has everything.

09:18.446 --> 09:20.277
Chris, where are we gonna sleep?

09:20.448 --> 09:23.781
No, no, no. There's a bedroom back here,
and we have that futon.

09:23.952 --> 09:26.853
Maybe we can pick up
another futon, used, for right over there.

09:27.021 --> 09:30.320
- A futon? A used futon?
- Yeah.

09:30.491 --> 09:31.890
Great. Yeah.

09:32.060 --> 09:34.995
You know, I bet this is
just like college, only not cool.

09:36.264 --> 09:37.458
You know what?

09:37.632 --> 09:40.123
Maybe we'll get out of here
for a little bit, okay?

09:40.301 --> 09:42.098
We can unpack later. Let's go.

09:42.270 --> 09:43.294
Okay.

09:54.048 --> 09:55.879
It's right here.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.206
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to have the time?

10:21.909 --> 10:24.343
Um... Uh...

10:24.946 --> 10:26.914
You're actually wearing a watch, so...

10:27.081 --> 10:28.480
Yeah.

10:28.983 --> 10:30.746
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's broken,
you know.

10:30.918 --> 10:32.510
Oh. Uh-huh.

10:32.687 --> 10:34.518
You're Chris Emerson, right?

10:34.689 --> 10:36.486
Yeah, yeah. What's your name, man?

10:36.658 --> 10:37.682
<i>- Alex.
- Hey.</i>

10:37.859 --> 10:40.293
Dude, it's too bad
you got kicked off the circuit.

10:40.461 --> 10:43.862
You were the most amazing surfer
since Slater, since Powers, man.

10:44.032 --> 10:47.195
- You totally screwed that guy up.
- Thanks, dude, I appreciate that.

10:47.368 --> 10:49.268
So, what are you doing here alone?

10:49.637 --> 10:51.502
That sounded kind of creepy, didn't it?

10:51.673 --> 10:53.402
Yeah, a little.

10:53.941 --> 10:55.101
I'm here with my brother.

10:55.276 --> 10:58.109
Reason I asked is because
it's not that safe around here...

10:58.279 --> 11:00.247
...for girls to be alone, you know?

11:02.250 --> 11:05.151
- Creepy, once again. Sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

11:05.820 --> 11:09.187
Just, for whatever reason,
this town manages to attract...

11:09.357 --> 11:12.087
...a lot of freaks and weirdoes.

11:12.627 --> 11:14.720
Not that I'm a freak or a weirdo.

11:17.332 --> 11:18.924
I'm just gonna stop talking, okay?

11:19.901 --> 11:21.095
Okay.

11:21.736 --> 11:24.603
Wanna check something real?
Check out the Frog Brothers' shop.

11:24.772 --> 11:26.763
I'm looking for some work.

11:26.941 --> 11:29.000
I got the place pretty much handled.

11:29.177 --> 11:30.337
Yeah, I know. I can tell.

11:30.511 --> 11:33.344
You seem really busy,
but I was looking to shape.

11:33.514 --> 11:36.039
Well, in that case, yeah,
check out Frog Brothers, man.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.310
He's the only real shaper
we have around here.

11:38.486 --> 11:39.510
Where's his shop at?

11:39.687 --> 11:43.123
Man, it's in the ass-end of nowhere,
but I'll draw you a map.

11:43.558 --> 11:46.823
- I'm gonna give you my number.
- Because that's not creepy.

11:46.994 --> 11:48.427
- Is it?
- I'm totally kidding.

11:48.596 --> 11:49.654
Okay, sorry.

11:51.099 --> 11:52.794
I don't really even know your name.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.629
- Evan.
- I'm Nicole.

11:55.803 --> 11:59.398
Just call me if you want somebody
to hang out with. There you go.

12:01.376 --> 12:02.707
Cool.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.270
This should be it, right up here.

12:09.617 --> 12:11.278
Charming.

12:29.437 --> 12:32.406
Call me crazy, but do you really think
anyone who lives here...

12:32.573 --> 12:35.133
...would be able to pay you to shape?

12:35.376 --> 12:37.367
It doesn't hurt to try.

12:59.934 --> 13:03.529
- Okay, can we go?
- No. Hand me a piece of paper and a pen.

13:03.938 --> 13:05.371
Why?

13:05.540 --> 13:08.976
Just in case he doesn't have a phone,
I want him to know where to find me.

13:09.143 --> 13:11.008
Oh, yes. Yes, leave our address...

13:11.179 --> 13:14.307
<i>...at the creepy
Texas Chainsaw Massacre trailer.</i>

13:14.482 --> 13:16.177
It's a good plan.

13:36.270 --> 13:38.170
I still think it's nicer than our place.

13:46.380 --> 13:49.508
And what do you think
the state of the shower is?

13:50.117 --> 13:51.846
Not good.

13:52.019 --> 13:54.283
I think I'm gonna give it a shot.

15:03.858 --> 15:06.292
Sorry. Did I scare you?

15:06.994 --> 15:08.985
No, sorry, you just...

15:09.330 --> 15:11.230
I didn't hear you come up.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.769
You want a picture? It might last longer.

15:17.405 --> 15:19.930
Sorry, man. Just...

15:20.107 --> 15:21.734
You look exactly like Shane Powers.

15:21.909 --> 15:24.002
That makes sense.

15:24.478 --> 15:27.242
What the hell happened to you, man?
You had everything.

15:27.415 --> 15:30.475
You were the greatest surfer in the world
and you just disappeared?

15:30.651 --> 15:32.710
I could probably ask you
the same question.

15:33.754 --> 15:35.153
Right?

15:35.323 --> 15:38.349
Yeah, well. I don't know.

15:38.526 --> 15:42.257
The dust hasn't settled yet
so I don't know what the hell happened.

15:42.697 --> 15:45.860
Well, don't take too long to figure it out.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.831
But I had a chance to change my life
and I took it, you know.

15:49.270 --> 15:50.828
Carpe diem.

16:00.748 --> 16:03.148
You got plans for tonight?

16:03.317 --> 16:04.841
No.

16:05.186 --> 16:06.312
I'm having a surf party.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.979
You should cruise over,
meet the rest of the guys.

16:10.157 --> 16:12.022
They're killer.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.729
Can I come?

16:17.898 --> 16:20.128
No, I don't think it's a good idea.

16:20.301 --> 16:21.962
Why not?

16:22.703 --> 16:24.967
I don't know.
A gut feeling I have, I don't know.

16:25.139 --> 16:26.197
I just met this guy.

16:26.374 --> 16:29.309
Oh, please, you had a poster of him
on your wall in high school.

16:30.411 --> 16:33.847
So I wanna go hang out
at his house? He's...

16:34.015 --> 16:36.142
He's kind of a weirdo.

16:36.317 --> 16:38.979
- Weird is good.
- No, weird is weird, all right?

16:39.153 --> 16:42.714
- I'm not going, so just save your breath.
- What do you mean you're not going?

16:42.890 --> 16:45.120
Chris, what are...? No. Get up, okay?

16:45.292 --> 16:47.590
- Get up. You need a night out.
- No, I don't.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.389
Okay, I need a night out.

16:49.563 --> 16:50.723
Let's go. Get up and...

16:52.933 --> 16:54.560
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:54.735 --> 16:58.136
I don't know if the two of you
are busy tonight or not, but...

16:58.472 --> 17:00.269
<i>...I have got The Goonies.</i>

17:01.876 --> 17:02.900
Excuse me?

17:04.310 --> 17:05.743
<i>The Goonies?</i>

17:05.913 --> 17:10.247
<i>Oh, my gosh, you mean to say the two
of you have never heard of The Goonies?</i>

17:11.618 --> 17:14.884
You are in for a very serious treat.

17:15.056 --> 17:17.148
Oh. Uh... Actually, I mean, that...

17:17.324 --> 17:21.454
Yeah, that sounds fun,
but we actually have plans.

17:23.531 --> 17:25.521
We're going to a party.

18:15.082 --> 18:16.549
It's not gonna be that bad.

18:16.717 --> 18:18.480
Talk to me after I have a drink.

18:18.652 --> 18:21.553
I don't... Don't. Listen,
you're missing out on the whole thing.

18:21.722 --> 18:26.056
And I mean, you know, it's...
And it's Chris-fucking-Emerson and his...

18:26.227 --> 18:28.422
...hot piece-of-ass sister, Nicole?
- Let's go.

18:28.596 --> 18:30.689
What are you guys doing here?
- Shane invited us.

18:30.865 --> 18:31.991
No, idiot, here in Luna Bay.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.657
- Are you fucking stalking me?
- We live here.

18:34.835 --> 18:36.735
Maybe we can get together again, Nicole.

18:36.904 --> 18:40.203
- You bar-bitching? That your new job?
- Not you, maybe your hot sister, though.

18:40.374 --> 18:42.342
Speaking of which,
it's been a long time.

18:42.510 --> 18:46.810
- You're looking really good in those boots.
- Why don't you stop being such an ass?

18:46.981 --> 18:48.471
Ooh! Yeah, that's right, walk away.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.948
Nicole, you're looking good,
you've really grown into yourself.

18:52.119 --> 18:53.143
- Fuck off.
- Call me.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.787
I told you this was a bad idea.

18:54.955 --> 18:59.187
- Forget about him. He's trying to get to you.
- I don't care, I'm not staying at this party.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.352
Chris. No, that's stupid,
we just got here.

19:02.930 --> 19:06.798
I don't wanna go anywhere, Chris,
I wanna stay and have a good time, okay?

19:06.967 --> 19:07.991
I'm not a kid anymore.

19:08.169 --> 19:11.332
I know you're not, but you're still
my responsibility, so let's go.

19:11.505 --> 19:14.269
Okay, I won't get in trouble, okay?
I promise.

19:14.441 --> 19:18.070
I'll take care of myself
and you take care of yourself, okay?

19:18.245 --> 19:21.043
Hey, man, what's up? Yes, dude.

19:21.215 --> 19:23.740
Dude, right? That's tight, bro.

19:23.918 --> 19:25.351
Okay, okay. Don't look now...

19:25.519 --> 19:30.013
...but that little hottie over there by the fire
is giving you all kinds of love.

19:31.892 --> 19:33.519
Have fun.

19:45.773 --> 19:47.297
Hey, Nicole.

19:47.474 --> 19:49.669
Nicole. Nicole.

20:01.188 --> 20:03.383
Nicole. Nicole.

20:04.592 --> 20:07.288
- Whoo! Woo-hoo.
- Hey, what's your deal?

20:07.728 --> 20:10.526
The deal is you're gonna
go over there and sit by yourself...

20:10.698 --> 20:13.633
...and you're gonna drink
these margaritas by yourself.

20:13.801 --> 20:16.736
- No, I'm not.
- Jon.

20:17.938 --> 20:20.406
Better than the alternative, bro.

20:32.786 --> 20:34.617
It's a hell of a view, isn't it?

20:35.189 --> 20:37.885
Yeah. The whole place, it's incredible.

20:42.363 --> 20:46.697
Yeah. When I saw that view,
I just knew I had to have this place.

20:48.102 --> 20:49.126
I'm Shane.

20:49.803 --> 20:50.827
I'm Nicole.

20:51.272 --> 20:53.740
Well, Nicole,
how about I give you a little tour?

20:54.642 --> 20:56.667
Yeah, okay.

21:11.926 --> 21:15.589
So are you gonna make your move or are
you just gonna watch me dance all night?

21:17.031 --> 21:18.794
I was waiting for my moment.

21:18.966 --> 21:22.527
Seems to me like your moment
almost passed you by, cowboy.

21:22.703 --> 21:24.967
I don't know,
you're standing here talking to me.

21:25.139 --> 21:28.131
Only because
I have a weakness for surfer boys.

21:28.309 --> 21:30.709
And because I know who you are.

21:30.978 --> 21:32.673
You follow surfing?

21:32.846 --> 21:34.245
Surfers.

21:34.415 --> 21:36.610
I follow surfers.

21:40.621 --> 21:42.555
And sometimes they follow me.

21:57.304 --> 21:59.738
This is un-fucking-believable.

22:13.821 --> 22:15.686
Wow.

22:16.290 --> 22:19.282
- This place is amazing.
- Thank you.

22:21.595 --> 22:25.395
So do you and your brother get along?

22:26.367 --> 22:28.733
Yeah. Well, most of the time, you know.

22:28.902 --> 22:32.030
- Kind of have to.
- You have to? Why's that?

22:32.206 --> 22:36.165
Well, because it's pretty much
just us now.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.313
Our parents died in a car accident
a few years ago.

22:40.481 --> 22:44.781
I think it was actually a lot harder
on Chris than it was on me.

22:44.952 --> 22:47.420
You know,
I think that's why he snapped.

22:47.588 --> 22:49.556
Is that why he got kicked off the circuit?

22:49.723 --> 22:50.985
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:51.158 --> 22:53.956
And lost all his sponsors.
Not the right image.

22:54.561 --> 22:59.828
So we started running out of money
and that's how we ended up here.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.661
Yeah. Yeah.

23:01.835 --> 23:03.564
Well, your brother's a good guy, huh?

23:03.737 --> 23:07.605
He just got a tough break. You both did.

23:07.775 --> 23:09.367
Well...

23:09.843 --> 23:13.404
...I actually think
death can be a positive thing.

23:13.580 --> 23:14.808
You know, because...

23:14.982 --> 23:19.146
...knowing you're gonna die
makes you appreciate life.

23:19.319 --> 23:20.616
The whole carpe diem thing.

23:21.755 --> 23:24.053
That's an interesting view
for someone so young.

23:25.659 --> 23:27.490
I'm not that young.

23:28.028 --> 23:29.393
Well...

23:30.364 --> 23:32.389
Dying is a part of living, you know?

23:32.566 --> 23:35.967
It's something that's gonna happen
to all of us someday, right?

23:37.204 --> 23:39.138
That depends.

23:42.276 --> 23:43.834
I wanna try something.

23:53.420 --> 23:56.355
I want you to take this dead rose
in your hand.

24:05.866 --> 24:09.996
I believe that it's possible
for us to change reality...

24:10.170 --> 24:11.762
...through sheer force of will.

24:12.206 --> 24:14.174
You think that's possible?

24:14.341 --> 24:16.400
Um...

24:17.544 --> 24:20.377
- I guess so.
- You guess so or you know so?

24:22.983 --> 24:25.076
- I know so.
- You know so.

24:25.252 --> 24:27.880
Okay, well, then close your eyes.

24:28.355 --> 24:30.289
Close your eyes.

24:31.091 --> 24:32.752
Now focus on this rose...

24:32.926 --> 24:37.260
...and try to imagine what it must have
been like when it was alive and vital.

24:39.833 --> 24:42.028
Do you feel anything?

24:42.603 --> 24:45.265
- Definitely.
- Mm-hm.

24:46.340 --> 24:48.069
Open your eyes.

24:52.779 --> 24:54.906
Oh, my God.

24:55.215 --> 24:57.706
How did you do that?

24:59.052 --> 25:00.542
Magic.

25:00.721 --> 25:02.689
And I didn't do it...

25:05.192 --> 25:08.889
...we did it, together.

25:09.263 --> 25:10.560
What is it?

25:11.465 --> 25:13.296
It's good, try it.

25:16.837 --> 25:19.169
- Smells good.
- Mm-hm.

25:23.343 --> 25:25.072
What do you think?

25:27.814 --> 25:29.441
I like it.

25:36.857 --> 25:39.223
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:39.393 --> 25:41.861
It just went right to my head.

25:43.864 --> 25:45.923
You wanna go outside
and get some fresh air?

25:46.099 --> 25:48.567
Yeah? Let's go.

26:01.648 --> 26:03.809
You wanna go for a ride?

26:05.452 --> 26:07.977
I don't know. It's kind of cold out.

26:08.155 --> 26:11.682
Well, that's what this is for.

26:32.746 --> 26:33.974
- Yo, Jon-Jon.
- Hey.

26:34.147 --> 26:35.580
Watch the pretty boy there.

26:35.749 --> 26:38.115
So here we are. Let's show him
a little something.

26:38.285 --> 26:39.513
Yeah.
- Come, now.

26:41.588 --> 26:43.647
- Why don't you come upstairs with me...
- Yo, Kyle.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.025
What the fuck?

26:51.398 --> 26:53.332
What is it? What?

26:53.834 --> 26:56.632
Fuck. It fucking stings, man,
that's not cool.

26:57.971 --> 27:00.963
Fucking asshole, man.
I'm trying to get fucking laid.

27:01.141 --> 27:04.133
This is a fucking brand-new shirt, prick.
Come here, come here.

27:04.311 --> 27:06.438
Come here. Give me the fucking knife.

27:07.447 --> 27:09.278
What the fuck?

27:09.850 --> 27:12.148
- Come back here.
- Oh, down he goes.

27:12.719 --> 27:14.016
I'm sorry.

27:14.187 --> 27:15.779
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

27:15.956 --> 27:17.890
I have to go check on my sister.

27:18.058 --> 27:20.583
Your sister?
- Sorry.

27:20.761 --> 27:23.491
So you go that way, huh? I can do that.

27:23.664 --> 27:25.427
- Sorry, I gotta go.
- Wait. Don't leave.

27:25.599 --> 27:26.964
- I gotta go.
- Don't leave.

27:27.134 --> 27:29.159
- Come on.
- Don't. Stay.

27:29.336 --> 27:31.804
- Sorry.
- Come.

28:39.039 --> 28:40.631
Feel better?

28:40.807 --> 28:42.672
- Much.
- Yeah?

29:09.236 --> 29:12.103
I'm sure she's fine, she's with Shane.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.603
You know, Shane's a good guy.

29:13.774 --> 29:16.800
If I were you,
I'd be happy that he's into your sister.

29:22.215 --> 29:24.513
Hey, get off the bike.

29:25.152 --> 29:26.676
- What? Chris.
- What's up, buddy?

29:26.853 --> 29:28.616
- Get off the bike.
- Is there a problem?

29:28.789 --> 29:31.587
No, dude, this is between
me and my sister, man. Thank you.

29:31.758 --> 29:35.023
She can handle herself, man. Believe me.

29:35.195 --> 29:36.492
Chris.
- Oh, hell, no.

29:37.097 --> 29:38.530
Chris.
- Jon.

29:38.698 --> 29:40.188
Take it easy.
- Let him go.

29:40.367 --> 29:41.800
- Calm down.
- Get off of me.

29:41.968 --> 29:44.436
- Overprotective much?
- She's my family, asshole.

29:44.604 --> 29:47.334
Cool it, bitch. Settle down.

29:47.841 --> 29:49.069
- Let him go.
- What?

29:49.242 --> 29:50.675
Let him go.

29:58.285 --> 30:00.719
Stay the hell away from my sister.

30:02.722 --> 30:04.280
Don't.

30:04.458 --> 30:06.517
Stay the hell out of Malibu, Lebowski.

30:06.693 --> 30:09.059
Stop walking like a fag.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.314
I knew we shouldn't have
gone to that party.

30:36.490 --> 30:41.325
I asked you, like, to do two things,
and you completely ignore me.

30:41.495 --> 30:43.690
Do not hang out with some dude
you don't know...

30:43.864 --> 30:46.332
...and don't go up to his room
to party with the guy.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.229
- Okay, Chris. I get it.
- What is that?

30:48.401 --> 30:50.164
Stop it.

30:51.671 --> 30:54.572
- Should have told me where you were...
- That's enough, stop it.

30:54.741 --> 30:57.175
Stop trying to be my dad.

31:00.947 --> 31:02.539
Oh, my God.

31:03.149 --> 31:04.980
Oh, my God.

31:05.485 --> 31:08.454
Chris, something is
seriously wrong with me right now.

31:09.022 --> 31:11.547
Nothing's wrong with you,
you're just drunk.

31:11.725 --> 31:13.056
Chris, I am not drunk.

31:13.226 --> 31:15.558
Something is seriously
the matter with me.

31:15.729 --> 31:19.028
Okay, just hang on a little bit, all right?
We're almost home.

31:19.199 --> 31:21.963
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm gonna...

31:28.508 --> 31:30.237
My stomach.

31:30.844 --> 31:32.539
Look, all right, we're almost there.

31:32.712 --> 31:35.340
I'm telling you,
there is something seriously the matter.

31:35.515 --> 31:39.178
You're fine. You just need
a glass of water and some Advil.

31:39.352 --> 31:41.377
All right, you're just drunk.

31:43.256 --> 31:44.951
NICOLE
I am not drunk.

31:45.892 --> 31:47.723
- Nicole. Nicole.
- I'm sick.

31:58.071 --> 32:00.562
Chris Emerson? I'm Edgar Frog.

32:00.740 --> 32:03.573
Surfboard shaper and vampire hunter.

32:04.010 --> 32:05.534
What?

32:06.179 --> 32:08.579
- Hey, get...
- What are you doing?

32:12.652 --> 32:16.588
You don't know what you're doing. I'm
trying to save you, your sister's infected.

32:16.756 --> 32:19.247
- What are you talking about?
- She's one of the undead.

32:19.693 --> 32:20.785
Get...

32:20.961 --> 32:22.690
Get out of my house.

32:22.862 --> 32:24.261
It's your funeral, pal.

32:56.630 --> 32:59.190
I told you to get the hell out of here, man.

32:59.366 --> 33:00.697
Hi.

33:02.669 --> 33:04.193
Hi.

33:04.371 --> 33:07.204
We didn't get to finish what we started.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.974
Yeah.

33:11.611 --> 33:13.943
Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?

33:15.915 --> 33:19.146
Now's not the best time.

33:25.592 --> 33:27.059
Yeah.

33:27.394 --> 33:29.828
Okay. Come on in.

33:38.705 --> 33:41.333
You know what? I'm sorry, I'm not...

33:41.508 --> 33:46.002
- I can't do this with my sister back there.
- Let me see if I can change your mind.

33:46.179 --> 33:47.703
Yeah?

34:07.801 --> 34:09.826
You taste good.

34:14.274 --> 34:15.969
Oh, hey.

34:16.376 --> 34:19.004
Lisa, get off. Stop.

34:21.547 --> 34:22.810
Lisa, stop it.

34:23.449 --> 34:26.612
Seriously, get...
What's the matter with you?

34:27.520 --> 34:28.851
Stop. Seriously, stop.

34:30.290 --> 34:31.813
Get off me.

34:31.991 --> 34:33.117
Lisa, get off.

34:34.393 --> 34:35.588
Lisa, get off.

34:55.849 --> 34:57.510
Lisa?

34:58.151 --> 35:00.949
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

35:20.306 --> 35:21.432
What the fuck?

35:33.686 --> 35:36.211
Hey, man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Whoa.

35:36.389 --> 35:37.413
Whoa.

35:37.590 --> 35:40.718
Let's get something straight.
I let you get away with that shit...

35:40.894 --> 35:44.694
...because I understand what it's like
to lose a family member to the other side.

35:44.864 --> 35:49.164
If it happens again, you're gonna end up on
the wrong side of the stake, are we clear?

35:50.036 --> 35:52.266
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.138
It's cool, man. Look, I just...

35:56.309 --> 35:59.437
I don't understand
what's going on, all right?

35:59.612 --> 36:01.079
You said my sister was infected?

36:01.247 --> 36:03.374
Your sister's become
a member of the undead.

36:03.550 --> 36:05.575
A night stalker. A bloodsucker.

36:05.752 --> 36:07.185
Nosferatu.

36:08.488 --> 36:10.922
Your sister's a suck monkey.

36:11.758 --> 36:13.988
Dude, that's... That's ridiculous, man.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.652
Ridiculous?
Then what are you doing here?

36:18.064 --> 36:21.625
Look, some crazy shit happened
at my place after you left.

36:21.801 --> 36:23.428
Define "crazy shit."

36:24.370 --> 36:27.703
Well, this...
This chick came into my house and...

36:27.874 --> 36:32.709
And she sprouted fangs and then she
turned into stone and exploded.

36:34.180 --> 36:36.512
Now, that's just ridiculous.

36:36.683 --> 36:39.447
Vampires don't just turn into stone
and then explode.

36:39.619 --> 36:43.055
They have to be pierced through the heart
with a sharp object.

36:44.424 --> 36:47.188
You know, I guess
the antlers could have done that.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.794
I thought it had to be
a wooden stake or something.

36:49.963 --> 36:52.523
That's a myth. Any sharp object will do.

36:52.699 --> 36:55.065
As a matter of fact,
it doesn't have to be sharp.

36:55.235 --> 36:57.931
It can be a blunt object,
as long as it pierces the heart.

36:58.104 --> 37:00.629
You said my sister was one of them?

37:01.207 --> 37:03.505
- But how would that happen?
- One of two ways:

37:03.676 --> 37:05.234
Either A, she was bit...

37:05.411 --> 37:09.404
...or B, she drank the blood
of the head vampire.

37:10.116 --> 37:12.812
How do you know so much
about vampires?

37:13.253 --> 37:15.721
Comic books, my friend, comic books.

37:15.889 --> 37:18.153
I ask you for answers
and you give me comic books?

37:18.324 --> 37:21.919
A lot of valuable information
can be gained by reading comic books.

37:22.095 --> 37:23.824
For example...

37:24.264 --> 37:25.595
...see here?

37:25.765 --> 37:28.325
This poor sap's drinking the blood
of the head vampire.

37:28.501 --> 37:32.062
They like to trick people
by putting it into wine bottles.

38:02.769 --> 38:05.294
Dude, what are you drinking, man?

38:05.838 --> 38:06.964
Frog Juice.

38:07.140 --> 38:10.200
Garlic, holy water and raw eggs.

38:12.111 --> 38:14.671
Okay, so what you're saying is,
based on a comic book...

38:14.847 --> 38:17.372
...my sister drank blood
and now she's a vampire.

38:17.550 --> 38:20.110
Half. She's only half vampire.

38:20.286 --> 38:24.313
She won't make the transition to full
bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.

38:24.490 --> 38:27.687
- Great.
- That is great, actually.

38:27.860 --> 38:31.296
Because it means you still have time
to save her mortal soul.

38:31.464 --> 38:37.164
All you have to do
is kill the head vampire before she feeds.

40:03.489 --> 40:04.888
Hello?

40:06.592 --> 40:08.116
Hello?

40:08.828 --> 40:10.887
It's open.

40:15.468 --> 40:16.992
Hi.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.570
I brought wine.

40:31.818 --> 40:33.843
I love wine.

40:53.339 --> 40:56.172
To be honest, I really didn't think
you dug me all that much.

40:56.342 --> 40:58.936
- Why would you think that?
- Just a vibe I got, I guess.

41:03.449 --> 41:05.679
What vibe are you getting now?

41:05.852 --> 41:08.320
A really good one.

41:24.437 --> 41:26.803
Nicole.
- Oh, shit.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.871
Did...? Did you do it?

41:29.041 --> 41:31.635
- Get the hell out of here.
- We didn't do anything, man.

41:31.811 --> 41:35.076
Dude, I didn't know you guys
were born-again Christians or whatever.

41:38.417 --> 41:39.884
Man, I'm not using your sister.

41:40.052 --> 41:42.452
Yeah, good to know. Thank you.
- I really like her.

42:26.766 --> 42:31.100
This is basically one of those, like,
good news/bad news scenario things.

42:31.270 --> 42:32.828
What do you want first?

42:33.005 --> 42:35.906
Oh, shit. Okay, the bad news.

42:36.075 --> 42:39.636
Okay, the bad news is that the wine
that Shane gave you the other night...

42:39.812 --> 42:42.144
...wasn't wine, all right, it was blood.

42:42.715 --> 42:44.649
Shane's blood.

42:45.551 --> 42:46.779
Right.

42:46.953 --> 42:50.787
Okay, Chris, I know you don't like the guy,
but, like, that's disgusting.

42:50.957 --> 42:54.324
No, and by drinking his blood,
you've been turned into a vampire.

42:54.493 --> 42:56.825
Right, I'm a vampire, Chris. Great.

42:56.996 --> 42:59.590
Stop being such an asshole,
I'm not a freaking vampire.

42:59.765 --> 43:02.063
I'm not being an asshole, Nicole.

43:02.501 --> 43:06.870
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but take a look.

43:07.039 --> 43:08.233
See anything missing?

43:08.674 --> 43:09.902
You.

43:14.814 --> 43:17.874
No. Vampire. You weren't gonna
make out with that kid...

43:18.050 --> 43:19.244
...you were gonna eat him.

43:19.418 --> 43:22.649
You had fangs and crazy eyes,
I saw it all.

43:28.327 --> 43:30.591
Okay, the good news
better be really fucking good.

43:30.763 --> 43:33.459
No, the good news is great news, okay?

43:33.633 --> 43:36.397
See, right now you're only, like,
half of a vampire.

43:36.569 --> 43:38.434
Which means
you can be turned back human.

43:38.604 --> 43:41.698
As long as Eddie and I
kill the head vampire before you feed.

43:41.874 --> 43:44.104
- So just don't eat anyone.
- What? Who's Eddie?

43:44.139 --> 43:45.822
Eddie Frog, he's a vampire slayer.

43:45.994 --> 43:48.929
- I thought he was a surfboard shaper.
- Well, that too.

43:50.131 --> 43:52.292
Right. Okay.

43:52.467 --> 43:55.527
Let me just get this straight then.
So you've teamed up...

43:55.703 --> 43:58.194
...with a
surfboard-shaper-slash-vampire-hunter...

43:58.373 --> 44:01.240
...so you can kill this guy
who I'm totally crushing on...

44:01.409 --> 44:04.435
...so you can save me
from eternal damnation?

44:04.612 --> 44:07.445
- Is that pretty much it?
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.

44:13.021 --> 44:15.990
- No. Calm down, calm down.
- No, Chris, I'm not gonna calm down.

44:16.157 --> 44:17.920
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

44:18.093 --> 44:20.152
I tried to eat that guy,
do you realize that?

44:20.328 --> 44:22.956
Do you know what it's like for me
to want to drink blood?

44:23.131 --> 44:26.430
Do you know how disgusting that is?
I'm a vegetarian.

45:35.703 --> 45:38.263
Is he behind Door Number 1?

45:38.806 --> 45:41.036
Door Number 2?

45:41.709 --> 45:43.540
Or Door Number...

45:44.779 --> 45:45.803
...3?

46:09.637 --> 46:11.264
We're screwed.

46:12.207 --> 46:15.870
There's just too many places
where the nest could be.

46:16.644 --> 46:19.807
Look, I already told you,
Shane's the head vampire.

46:19.981 --> 46:22.245
We went to party at his house
a couple nights ago.

46:22.417 --> 46:24.385
It's gotta be the nest.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.784
There's no way
that any self-respecting vampire...

46:27.956 --> 46:29.924
...would ever live in a place like that.

46:30.091 --> 46:34.619
I mean, they may use it as a lure
or a place to feed...

46:35.163 --> 46:37.154
...but they'd never sleep there.

46:37.332 --> 46:39.266
Vampires...

46:39.901 --> 46:43.667
...always look for a place
with a history of human suffering.

46:44.138 --> 46:48.097
<i>Deep, dark, dank places.</i>

46:49.177 --> 46:52.738
<i>Places that never see the light of day.</i>

46:52.914 --> 46:55.439
<i>Places with lots of vermin.</i>

46:55.817 --> 47:00.254
<i>Places that smell of rot and earth...</i>

47:00.655 --> 47:02.623
<i>... and decay.</i>

47:13.935 --> 47:17.666
Nicole.

47:20.441 --> 47:24.241
Nicole.

47:51.172 --> 47:53.163
<i>Nicole.</i>

47:57.045 --> 47:58.774
<i>Hurry.</i>

48:07.455 --> 48:09.150
<i>Hurry.</i>

48:16.030 --> 48:18.362
There's no way we can find out
where the nest is...

48:18.533 --> 48:21.024
...without you being in their inner circle.

48:21.202 --> 48:23.136
Well, then that's what I'll do.

48:23.671 --> 48:24.933
I'll get back in with them.

48:25.106 --> 48:28.542
- I'm gonna become one of them.
- Don't be stupid, all right?

48:28.710 --> 48:30.974
They can read your thoughts
before you have them.

48:31.145 --> 48:33.909
Come on, man. She's family, asshole.

48:41.255 --> 48:43.553
You hit a soft spot there.

48:44.092 --> 48:46.287
I know what it's like to lose a sibling.

48:49.097 --> 48:53.363
If you're gonna do this,
then you have to do it all the way.

48:53.801 --> 48:56.065
I mean, you have to be seduced by it.

48:56.237 --> 48:58.762
You have to succumb to it.

48:59.841 --> 49:04.904
You have to take it all the way
to the brink of becoming a full vampire.

49:05.079 --> 49:09.209
And then you have to betray them
at the last possible moment.

49:09.384 --> 49:11.875
Do you think you can really handle that?

49:12.820 --> 49:14.253
It's the only way, Eddie.

49:15.056 --> 49:16.614
Edgar.

49:16.791 --> 49:18.759
Sorry, Edgar.

49:18.926 --> 49:20.052
You know I'm right.

49:27.802 --> 49:29.429
It's a dangerous game.

49:30.204 --> 49:32.900
And it's one that you're likely to lose.

49:34.008 --> 49:35.839
So just know...

49:36.978 --> 49:38.946
...if you forget your place...

49:39.547 --> 49:41.777
...and you become one of them...

49:42.750 --> 49:45.082
...l'll be coming for you.

50:50.651 --> 50:51.845
This shit's cool.

50:52.019 --> 50:55.045
Yo, Kyle, stop playing
with yourself, man, the game gonna start.

50:55.223 --> 50:56.918
Fucking cheater.
- You know what?

50:57.091 --> 50:59.855
- I been calling you, brethren.
- You haven't been calling me.

51:00.027 --> 51:01.358
Shut up.

51:03.397 --> 51:04.557
Always with your crying.

51:04.732 --> 51:07.701
- Dude, quit it. Fucking cheater.
- Listen, don't start crying.

51:07.869 --> 51:09.427
Check it out. Check it out.

51:09.604 --> 51:11.094
Tape them.

51:11.272 --> 51:13.069
- Tape them, man.
- Skin out.

51:13.574 --> 51:16.975
So nice.
- Backside.

51:21.082 --> 51:23.550
Yeah, bitch.
- Holy fuck.

51:23.718 --> 51:25.811
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Motherfucker.

51:25.987 --> 51:28.922
You're a dead man.
- Yeah, fucking blow me, buddy. Again.

51:29.090 --> 51:31.149
- Who's the cheater now?
- Fucking white people.

51:31.325 --> 51:32.883
Pull this out. I ain't playing.

51:33.060 --> 51:36.120
- You're gonna be all over the fucking Net.
- Stop. Fuck off.

51:36.297 --> 51:38.197
Dude, you're fucking squirting
everywhere.

51:38.366 --> 51:39.663
- You're a squirter.
- Shane.

52:05.159 --> 52:07.024
What about my brother?

52:07.395 --> 52:08.794
I don't wanna lose him.

52:08.963 --> 52:10.555
You won't.

52:16.504 --> 52:18.369
Trust me.

53:38.653 --> 53:39.881
Full name?

53:40.054 --> 53:41.783
Uh, Nicole.

53:43.057 --> 53:44.581
Em...

53:44.825 --> 53:46.417
Emerson.

53:48.295 --> 53:50.160
All right, we'll call you.

53:50.331 --> 53:52.822
That's it? Just gonna
type her name onto a computer...

53:53.000 --> 53:55.468
...and hope someone turns her in
like a dog pound?

53:55.636 --> 53:58.366
- Isn't that kind of passive?
- Son, we have a system.

53:58.539 --> 54:00.734
Officer, there's gotta be
something you can do...

54:00.908 --> 54:03.968
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff, I'm sorry.

54:04.211 --> 54:05.542
I'm really worried about her.

54:05.713 --> 54:07.977
McGRAW: We have a lot of missing persons
around here.

54:08.149 --> 54:11.312
I know. I mean,
what if they're not missing, you know?

54:11.485 --> 54:12.952
It could be something else.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.213
Son, hit the road. We have a system.

54:18.559 --> 54:20.823
Luna Bay. Sheriff McGraw.

54:21.262 --> 54:22.923
Really? How big?

54:23.364 --> 54:25.992
Yeah, last week
I caught about a 25-pounder.

54:36.944 --> 54:39.344
Not very helpful, huh?

54:40.414 --> 54:43.542
Yeah, I was gonna ask them
if they could help us find Lisa.

54:43.718 --> 54:46.380
Haven't seen her in a couple of days.

54:47.388 --> 54:50.846
Hey, didn't I see you with her last?

54:52.893 --> 54:54.588
Where's my sister, man?

54:54.762 --> 54:57.356
Oh, yeah, your sister.

54:57.531 --> 54:59.226
Man, I saw her like an hour ago.

54:59.400 --> 55:01.664
She looked like she was having
a really good time.

55:01.836 --> 55:03.360
Where the hell is my sister, man?

55:03.537 --> 55:07.234
<i>Oh, hey, hey. Relax, little man, okay?</i>

55:07.408 --> 55:11.811
Trust me when I tell you this is, right here,
a time that you wanna keep your cool...

55:11.979 --> 55:14.470
...if you ever wanna see Nicole again.

55:21.756 --> 55:23.280
What do you want?

55:24.625 --> 55:26.354
It's not what I want, bro...

55:26.994 --> 55:29.258
...it's what Shane wants.

55:30.798 --> 55:32.698
Get in the car.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.171
How's it, ladies?

56:25.052 --> 56:27.748
Mr. Vampire Slayer, how you doing?

56:27.988 --> 56:29.649
You okay?

56:30.024 --> 56:31.457
I'm good.

56:31.625 --> 56:33.388
I'm really good.

56:37.531 --> 56:39.795
Sorry about last night, man.

56:40.901 --> 56:43.335
You were protecting your sister.

56:44.305 --> 56:45.932
I get it.

56:47.608 --> 56:49.371
But I'd never do anything to hurt her.

56:49.543 --> 56:55.778
In fact, once you understand it a little more,
you'll see I've given Nicole a gift.

56:58.319 --> 57:01.755
Do you know how much
the fear of death has limited you, Chris?

57:01.922 --> 57:04.550
The negative impact it's had on your life?

57:05.593 --> 57:07.857
You're probably not even aware of it.

57:08.028 --> 57:12.192
And I'm not just talking about
the fear of your own death, no.

57:12.933 --> 57:16.994
Look at what the fear of losing
your loved ones has done to you.

57:18.138 --> 57:20.538
You've been so worried
about losing Nicole...

57:20.708 --> 57:24.906
...that it's made you paranoid
and overprotective.

57:26.213 --> 57:28.875
I can take that fear away.

57:29.250 --> 57:32.913
I can make you
part of a real family, Chris.

57:33.721 --> 57:36.155
One that never dies.

57:37.958 --> 57:42.088
Kyle's human family
wrote him off a long time ago.

57:42.496 --> 57:45.090
They thought he was suicidal.

57:45.266 --> 57:47.427
But I saw him for what he truly was...

57:47.968 --> 57:50.402
...an adrenaline junkie.

57:52.439 --> 57:55.931
Erik, well, the less we say about his past,
the better.

57:56.110 --> 58:00.376
We wouldn't wanna make you
an accessory after the fact, now would we?

58:01.649 --> 58:04.948
And Jonny boy, well...

58:05.552 --> 58:09.989
...after you shattered his knee,
he was never supposed to surf again.

58:11.392 --> 58:12.484
Look at him now.

58:13.527 --> 58:15.051
Stronger than ever, bro.

58:16.664 --> 58:20.430
But for you to truly understand
what we are, Chris...

58:20.601 --> 58:23.502
...you have to see the world
the way we do.

58:24.438 --> 58:26.599
You and your sister...

58:26.941 --> 58:29.034
...will never grow old...

58:29.443 --> 58:32.879
...you'll never die
and you'll never know fear again.

58:34.248 --> 58:36.512
But you have to take that first step.

58:51.665 --> 58:53.030
And what's that?

58:54.935 --> 58:58.803
It's a little something
me and the boys came up with.

59:26.467 --> 59:29.163
Warriors.

59:30.371 --> 59:33.363
- What the...?
- Come out to play.

59:33.540 --> 59:35.098
Let's go.

59:55.996 --> 59:57.361
Oh, shit.

59:57.531 --> 59:59.795
Now! Now!

01:00:21.655 --> 01:00:23.316
Yo, hold up.

01:00:26.193 --> 01:00:28.559
Let him out, Kyle.

01:00:46.413 --> 01:00:47.710
How do you like that, bitch?

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:50.878
Go, go.

01:01:20.814 --> 01:01:22.247
Jump it, Chris.

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.391
Fuck you!

01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:37.257
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:52.242
Fuck you!

01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:07.193
How do you like that?

01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:09.955
Hey, on top of the world, Ma.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:17.762
Hold on, brother.

01:02:17.938 --> 01:02:20.668
It's a private club
and you're not a member.

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:23.036
Not yet, anyway.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:27.039
Well, what if I say yes?

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:30.906
Think long and hard about it, Chris.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:34.485
Once you join the tribe,
there's no turning back.

01:02:52.873 --> 01:02:55.034
Your check bounced.

01:02:55.742 --> 01:02:59.041
No, it's... I transferred some money
from one account to the other, so...

01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:03.206
Save the bull for your buddies. I'm gonna
need a new security deposit immediately.

01:03:03.383 --> 01:03:06.819
It's gonna need to be in the form
of a cashier's check or a money order.

01:03:06.987 --> 01:03:09.649
Maybe this is my fault.
Maybe I gave the wrong impression.

01:03:09.823 --> 01:03:12.451
Come on, it's not that big of a deal.
Just wait two days.

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.857
Just let me finish. Could you please
take your sunglasses off?

01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:18.156
I can't talk to you
unless I can see your eyes.

01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:21.460
Look, I didn't want you guys
to feel like I was trying to step in...

01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:25.071
...and act like your parents, but that
doesn't mean you can go crazy here.

01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:29.801
I saw your sister had a guy over
last night. How old is she?

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.274
- She's almost, like, 18.
- That means she's 17 years old.

01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:36.814
And you coming and going
at all hours of the day and night...

01:03:36.984 --> 01:03:39.578
You know,
I have a reputation to think of, l...

01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:41.880
I realize I am not your mother, but...

01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:45.821
But you... Doesn't mean you can
behave like this on my property.

01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:47.858
All right, I'm sorry.

01:03:51.064 --> 01:03:52.964
Yeah, me too.

01:03:55.035 --> 01:03:58.232
Partying all night, sleeping all day.

01:03:58.405 --> 01:04:01.169
You both need to quit acting
like a couple of vampires.

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:14.718
This is ridiculous.

01:04:36.209 --> 01:04:38.370
<i>You and your sister...</i>

01:04:38.679 --> 01:04:40.670
<i>... will never grow old...</i>

01:04:41.214 --> 01:04:44.650
<i>... you'll never die
and you'll never know fear again.</i>

01:05:41.575 --> 01:05:44.840
You're sharking it, man,
you're sharking it.

01:05:45.746 --> 01:05:47.338
Who wants some?

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:49.106
Now you ask?

01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:51.910
- Where we headed?
- Devil's Reef.

01:05:52.085 --> 01:05:54.849
I hear it's firing right now.

01:05:55.088 --> 01:05:59.115
- We're paddling out tonight?
- Yeah, why not?

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:02.318
There's no moon,
bet we're not gonna see anything.

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:08.029
What, you guys have night vision
or something?

01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:10.533
What kind of night vision
you chatting about, boy?

01:06:10.704 --> 01:06:14.162
- Can't you turn yourselves into bats?
- Way too many movies, bro.

01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:17.538
Yeah, we don't have night vision, Chris.

01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:22.141
Bats, they don't actually have
night vision either, they have sonar.

01:06:22.315 --> 01:06:23.907
You know what? You're half right.

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:26.882
Like I told you before,
we do see things differently.

01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:29.185
Kind of like you're about to.

01:06:34.027 --> 01:06:36.996
After you have a little taste of this.

01:07:19.239 --> 01:07:21.207
Bye, boy.

01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:38.513
- You haven't seen anything yet, Chris.
- No, you ain't. You're not done yet.

01:07:38.692 --> 01:07:42.128
Wait till you see the girls
we got waiting for us at the reef, bro.

01:07:46.032 --> 01:07:48.262
It's gonna be crazy, bro.

01:07:49.202 --> 01:07:52.035
Crazy.

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:18.826
All right, my turn.

01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:24.263
Did you ever hear
of getting your own thing?

01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:26.529
Did you ever hear of shutting the hell up?

01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:29.197
You mind yourself, boy. Mister, ease off.

01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:30.774
All right, enough.

01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:34.176
What? What, what?

01:08:34.346 --> 01:08:35.506
Camera, please.

01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:37.816
All right, girls.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.381
I dare you guys to kiss.

01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:43.216
- Double dare?
- Double dare.

01:08:46.893 --> 01:08:49.361
Oh, fuck, are you seeing this?
Seriously, watch.

01:08:51.598 --> 01:08:52.895
I think so.

01:08:56.937 --> 01:08:58.198
Guys?
- Oh, hey.

01:08:58.371 --> 01:09:00.532
- We're out of here.
- Where are you going?

01:09:00.707 --> 01:09:02.732
Back to our place...

01:09:02.908 --> 01:09:04.638
...for a drink.
- I'll come with you.

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.473
No, hang back, Chris,
there's plenty for you to do here.

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:11.447
Besides, this is Nicole's time.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:21.725
Just have a seat, man.

01:09:23.263 --> 01:09:25.060
Attaboy.

01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:43.513
So check this out.

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:48.651
Do you know that salt water and blood
are basically the same thing?

01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:50.545
It's true.

01:09:50.724 --> 01:09:53.921
There's a French biologist
that did this experiment on a stray dog...

01:09:54.094 --> 01:09:55.994
...around the turn of the century.

01:09:56.162 --> 01:10:00.155
He drained all the blood out of the dog
and replaced it with diluted seawater...

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:04.030
...and everybody thought
that this dog was gonna die.

01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:06.300
Except the dog didn't.

01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:10.534
What they found is that
all the missing blood had regenerated.

01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:13.175
The saltwater became blood.

01:10:13.413 --> 01:10:18.646
And after that, the dog was more alive
and vibrant than it ever had been before.

01:10:19.919 --> 01:10:24.356
The dog went on to live
a long and very healthy life.

01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:33.191
To long life, Chris.

01:10:46.846 --> 01:10:48.575
Let me try some of that.

01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:52.551
I don't really think
you'd find it too much to your liking.

01:10:52.719 --> 01:10:55.187
You might wanna just stick with the beer.

01:10:59.626 --> 01:11:04.222
So what exactly was the point
of your very long and boring story, Jon?

01:11:04.397 --> 01:11:06.388
Basically, what he's trying to say is...

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:08.363
...we're vampires.

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:13.631
- Ooh. Scary.
- No, but seriously...

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:16.674
...we're vampires.

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:25.180
Help me!

01:11:27.754 --> 01:11:28.778
No, no, no.

01:11:30.056 --> 01:11:32.524
No, please.

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.888
Let me go.

01:11:39.065 --> 01:11:40.657
Shut the fuck up.

01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:44.535
No, no, no.

01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:51.277
I'm thinking I love this girl.
Oh, fuck, I love this girl.

01:11:54.114 --> 01:11:56.105
Do it.

01:11:58.685 --> 01:12:02.018
Do it!

01:12:03.056 --> 01:12:05.217
Run. Go.

01:12:05.391 --> 01:12:06.881
Come on.

01:12:32.552 --> 01:12:33.985
You're fucked up, bro.

01:12:34.154 --> 01:12:37.954
Shane's not around to save your ass
and I've had it with your attitude.

01:12:47.767 --> 01:12:50.292
Guess you think I'm kidding you, bud...

01:12:51.504 --> 01:12:53.131
...but it ain't so.

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:57.070
Where's Shane now, bi...? Fuck.

01:13:24.204 --> 01:13:26.832
You ain't got no fucking stick now,
do you?

01:13:28.575 --> 01:13:29.837
Come on, let's finish this.

01:13:30.009 --> 01:13:31.704
Hey!

01:13:33.346 --> 01:13:34.540
Who ordered the stake?

01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:40.247
Are you cool?

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.717
Yeah, I'm cool.

01:13:41.888 --> 01:13:45.221
I said, are you cool?

01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:46.688
Show me your teeth.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.555
I said I'm cool.

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:51.561
And I said, show me your teeth.

01:13:52.866 --> 01:13:56.461
I am cool.

01:13:56.903 --> 01:13:59.895
Yeah, I can see that.

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.774
We don't have time for this shit, Eddie.

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:06.173
We have to get to the nest
and get my sister before she feeds.

01:14:08.715 --> 01:14:11.013
That's what I'm talking about.

01:14:13.553 --> 01:14:15.646
I hate fucking vampires.

01:14:27.233 --> 01:14:28.495
What are you doing, man?

01:14:28.668 --> 01:14:30.636
Turning this into holy water.

01:14:30.803 --> 01:14:33.169
- I'm a minister.
- You're a minister?

01:14:33.339 --> 01:14:35.136
Yup. I got ordained online.

01:14:35.308 --> 01:14:39.176
I'm officially recognized by the International
Association of Online Ministers...

01:14:39.345 --> 01:14:43.543
...as the Honorable Reverend Edgar Frog,
the vampire hunter.

01:14:43.716 --> 01:14:45.183
Did you study for that?

01:14:45.351 --> 01:14:48.218
No. I went to the website,
filled out a couple forms...

01:14:48.388 --> 01:14:49.685
...and clicked "Ordain Me."

01:14:49.856 --> 01:14:54.225
Now, before going into battle, there's
a few things that you need to be briefed on.

01:14:54.394 --> 01:14:57.852
First of all, when a vampire buys it,
it's never a pretty sight.

01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:00.056
No two bloodsuckers
go out the same way.

01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:03.361
Some yell and scream, some go quietly,
some explode, some implode...

01:15:03.536 --> 01:15:05.629
...but all will try to take you with them.

01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:08.137
As far as your arsenal of vamp artillery:

01:15:08.308 --> 01:15:09.400
We got stakes.

01:15:09.575 --> 01:15:12.305
Got some wooden ones,
got some metal ones...

01:15:12.745 --> 01:15:14.337
...and some carbon-fibers.

01:15:14.514 --> 01:15:16.914
I like the resins,
they're light and easy to handle.

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:20.541
That said, there's nothing as good
as the old-fashioned, classic wood job.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.950
Safe, sturdy, reliable.

01:15:23.122 --> 01:15:27.491
Next, we have my air-propelled-rocket
grenade launcher for holy-water balloons.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.457
This is my baby, don't touch it.

01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:31.597
We also have one of these.

01:15:31.764 --> 01:15:34.232
- You know how to use this, right?
- Yeah, totally.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.369
- Okay, good.
- No, dude, I have no idea what that is.

01:15:37.537 --> 01:15:38.834
It's a garlic bolo.

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:42.571
Never mind, I'll hold on to this one.

01:15:44.544 --> 01:15:47.172
Let's go kill some vampires.

01:16:11.571 --> 01:16:13.801
They know we're here.

01:16:39.232 --> 01:16:41.166
Are you ready?

01:16:43.403 --> 01:16:46.463
I guess so.
- You guess so?

01:16:49.842 --> 01:16:51.707
I know so.

01:17:00.253 --> 01:17:02.153
Help me.

01:17:04.657 --> 01:17:06.318
Help me.

01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:19.666
You smell that?

01:17:22.141 --> 01:17:25.304
Smells like fungus or death.

01:17:27.013 --> 01:17:29.607
It's vampire BO.

01:18:04.317 --> 01:18:05.750
What?

01:18:07.053 --> 01:18:09.715
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Just follow me.

01:18:23.336 --> 01:18:26.362
Nicole, help me.

01:18:27.473 --> 01:18:28.770
Evan.

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:34.474
I can't.

01:18:34.914 --> 01:18:37.178
You said you were ready.

01:18:38.117 --> 01:18:39.778
But I know him.

01:18:41.687 --> 01:18:44.747
Well, he's the only thing
that still stands between us, Nicole.

01:18:44.924 --> 01:18:47.449
The only thing that stands
between you and immortality.

01:18:47.627 --> 01:18:50.221
If you wanna be with me...

01:18:50.396 --> 01:18:51.624
...if you love me...

01:18:51.797 --> 01:18:53.856
...you'll do this.

01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:22.124
Quiet, man, you'll wake the dead.

01:19:22.295 --> 01:19:23.728
Chris.

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:26.054
Chris.

01:19:29.302 --> 01:19:30.929
Chris.

01:19:31.504 --> 01:19:32.732
Shit.

01:19:32.905 --> 01:19:36.033
What part of "stay together"
don't you understand?

01:20:45.378 --> 01:20:47.539
I smell ugly.

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:05.890
Chris.

01:21:08.334 --> 01:21:09.961
Come on, Chris.

01:21:10.136 --> 01:21:11.535
Chris isn't here, Eddie...

01:21:11.971 --> 01:21:13.461
...but your brother is.

01:21:13.639 --> 01:21:15.573
Where are you?

01:21:22.281 --> 01:21:23.976
Yup, it's ugly.

01:21:26.018 --> 01:21:27.383
Missed.

01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:35.188
Pop goes the weasel.

01:22:00.619 --> 01:22:02.280
<i>Chris.</i>

01:22:04.156 --> 01:22:06.522
<i>Stay forever.</i>

01:22:06.692 --> 01:22:09.217
<i>Live forever.</i>

01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:12.262
<i>Stay with family.</i>

01:22:12.431 --> 01:22:13.693
<i>Chris.</i>

01:22:16.202 --> 01:22:17.533
Chris.

01:22:18.637 --> 01:22:20.366
Welcome.

01:22:39.425 --> 01:22:40.483
Chris.

01:22:43.295 --> 01:22:46.992
I've been waiting to meet someone like you
for quite some time, Chris.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:50.465
Someone that would push the boundaries,
someone that would challenge me.

01:22:50.636 --> 01:22:52.831
- I saw that in you.
- Chris.

01:22:57.643 --> 01:23:00.043
I don't wanna lose my brother.

01:23:00.579 --> 01:23:02.911
Come on, taking in someone's essence...

01:23:03.082 --> 01:23:05.141
...consuming living human blood...

01:23:05.317 --> 01:23:07.478
...that's the real rush.

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:20.356
No!

01:23:20.533 --> 01:23:21.591
Shane!

01:23:25.771 --> 01:23:27.705
No. Shane. Stop.

01:23:27.873 --> 01:23:30.808
You're killing him. Shane!

01:23:32.678 --> 01:23:34.202
No!

01:23:45.424 --> 01:23:46.652
Nicole.

01:23:46.826 --> 01:23:48.657
Why?

01:23:48.828 --> 01:23:50.557
He's family, asshole.

01:23:52.898 --> 01:23:54.695
Shane.

01:23:57.636 --> 01:23:58.660
Shane, stop.

01:24:16.255 --> 01:24:17.813
<i>Nicole.</i>

01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:22.054
<i>Nicole.</i>

01:24:22.228 --> 01:24:24.560
<i>Nicole.</i>

01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:27.098
<i>Nicole.</i>

01:24:41.313 --> 01:24:43.611
Build a man a fire...

01:24:44.216 --> 01:24:46.275
...and he's warm for a day.

01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:49.920
Light a man on fire...

01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:53.891
...and he's warm for the rest of his life.

01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:09.400
You'll be getting a bill for my services.

01:25:41.507 --> 01:25:44.908
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, it's what I do.

01:25:46.612 --> 01:25:48.136
And it's Edgar.

01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:59.080
Hey, is it...?

01:25:59.258 --> 01:26:01.123
Is it cool if I call you sometime?

01:26:01.293 --> 01:26:03.284
Uh...

01:26:03.829 --> 01:26:05.524
Okay.

01:26:06.832 --> 01:26:08.390
Yes!

01:26:17.743 --> 01:26:19.438
Woo-hoo!

01:26:57.950 --> 01:27:00.748
This is completely unacceptable.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:03.952
I know exactly what you've been up to.

01:27:04.123 --> 01:27:07.581
I am telling you, it has to stop right now.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.856
I will not stand by and watch
two young people that I care about...

01:27:12.031 --> 01:27:14.158
...fall into this trap, you hear me?

01:27:18.003 --> 01:27:22.337
So if I so much as see one seed...

01:27:22.808 --> 01:27:25.641
...or catch one whiff of reefer...

01:27:25.811 --> 01:27:28.507
And believe me,
I know what it smells like.

01:27:28.681 --> 01:27:30.046
- I'm calling the cops.

01:27:30.215 --> 01:27:35.380
No warning. We are talking
zero tolerance, you got that?

01:27:36.288 --> 01:27:39.485
End of discussion.

01:28:34.513 --> 01:28:36.606
Cut the theatrics.

01:28:37.483 --> 01:28:39.644
I know you're out there.

01:28:39.818 --> 01:28:41.149
Show yourself.

01:28:46.425 --> 01:28:48.518
That's a good way
to get yourself staked, Sam.

01:28:48.694 --> 01:28:50.662
Easy there, compadre.

01:28:50.829 --> 01:28:52.854
After all the shit that you pulled?

01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:57.968
I think you can at least hear me out.
I mean, I feel like you owe me that.

01:28:58.137 --> 01:29:01.163
You really expect me to act like
nothing ever happened?

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.274
No, I've already forgiven you.

01:29:03.442 --> 01:29:05.774
It's water under the bridge.

01:29:06.278 --> 01:29:07.905
Stay there.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.039
- You don't want it to go down like this.
- Oh, it's going down like this.

01:29:12.217 --> 01:29:13.514
I'm warning you.

01:29:13.685 --> 01:29:15.007
Hey, I'm trembling.

01:31:53.011 --> 01:31:55.002
