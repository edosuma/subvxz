07:38.792 --> 07:39.760
[phone chimes]

07:39.793 --> 07:42.195
IS MINDY HOME?
[screaming]

07:42.229 --> 07:43.797
MURDERER!
AH! HEY!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.866
NO! IT'S ME.
GRAHAM.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.901
WHAT THE HELL?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.670
WELL, YOU SAID 8:00.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.772
OH, LET ME GUESS.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.707
THE BORING STOCKBROKERS
YOU USUALLY DATE

07:53.741 --> 07:54.508
COME IN THROUGH THE DOOR.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.044
YEAH, THEY ALSO
DON'T GET SHOT.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.979
LUCKY FOR YOU,
I LOST MY HANDGUN.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.148
I SEE A FIRE ESCAPE,
I CLIMB IT.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.817
IF I SEE SOMETHING I WANT,
I TAKE IT.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.655
AND IF I SEE A COMFY SOFA,
OH, I LIKE TO FLOP ON IT.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.056
AHH!

08:09.089 --> 08:10.223
OH, MY GOD.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.625
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ELBOW?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.627
OH, I "SHRALPED" IT.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.929
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.798
I GOT THIS ONE, UH, 1990.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.601
MY FIRST INTERNATIONAL
SKATING TOUR.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.770
I GOT SUPER LOADED
AND FELL OFF THE LOUVRE.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.171
AND THIS?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.540
BROKEN COLLARBONE.
X-GAMES '02.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.308
WOW! YOU COMPETED INJURED,
LIKE KERRI STRUG?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.310
NO, I GOT SUPER LOADED
AND FELL OFF THE PODIUM

08:30.343 --> 08:31.712
AT THE MEDAL CEREMONY.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.713
OF COURSE.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.781
BUT I LEARNED SOMETHING
THAT DAY.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.717
DRINKING WAS HOLDING ME BACK
FROM FOLLOWING MY BLISS.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.819
SO I GOT CLEAN,
EXCEPT ON WEEKENDS.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.321
STARTED MY SKATEBOARD COMPANY,
PREGNANT MERMAID.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.057
DESIGNED THE LOGO MYSELF.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.325
HER BOOBS ARE GREAT.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.628
ANY IDIOT CAN DRAW BOOBS.
CHECK OUT THE HAND.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.696
I'M PROUDEST OF THE HAND.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.764
MM.
YOU HAVE ANY SCARS?

08:50.798 --> 08:52.265
MM, ONLY ON MY HEART.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.602
OH! NO, I ACTUALLY
HAVE A SCAR.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.771
THIS IS FROM
FILENE'S BASEMENT, 2002.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.807
I WAS RUSHING
TO TRY ON A SHIRT.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.741
STILL HAD ITS PINS
IN IT.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.976
I ALMOST DIED THAT DAY.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.612
WHOA.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.914
WHOA.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.616
(waiter)
TWO BEERS.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.984
THANK YOU.
AND ONE JILL'S
NAUGHTY LEMONADE

09:11.018 --> 09:12.720
WITH AGAVE INSTEAD
OF SIMPLE SYRUP

09:12.753 --> 09:13.687
AND SKINNY BITCH VODKA.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.755
THANK YOU.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.089
[laughs]
GOOD GOD, MAN!

09:16.123 --> 09:17.858
WELL, I'M SORRY, DAD,
BUT A BEER WOULD COST ME

09:17.891 --> 09:19.627
ALL MY SPLURGE POINTS
FOR THE WEEK.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.661
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA
LOSE SOME L.B.s,

09:20.694 --> 09:22.763
YOU GOTTA COME LIFT
WITH ME AND MY RUGBY TEAM.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.765
YOU WERE ON
YOUR COLLEGE RUGBY TEAM?

09:24.798 --> 09:25.933
THERE IS A MAN.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.169
OH, I SHOULD SAY IT WAS REALLY
MORE OF A DRINKING TEAM

09:29.202 --> 09:30.638
WITH A RUGBY PROBLEM.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.639
WHAT!
[laughs]

09:31.672 --> 09:34.274
AND I WAS THE CAPTAIN.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.210
SO LONG, SPLURGE POINTS.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.813
(Graham)
CAN I GET CHICKEN
AND FRIJOLES?

09:39.847 --> 09:42.215
THAT WAS SPANISH.
WAS IT?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.785
YEAH, I GOT YOU WHAT I GOT,
WHICH IS A GARBAGE BURRITO.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.019
OKAY.
OH!

09:46.053 --> 09:47.320
HOLD UP, CHECK THIS OUT.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.789
EXCUSE ME.
OH.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.291
DID ANYONE ORDER
THE SUPER HOT INDIAN GIRL

09:51.324 --> 09:52.760
WITH THE EXTRA CURVES?

09:52.793 --> 09:55.095
GRAHAM!
YOU'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.329
BESIDES,
I'M NOT EVEN THAT HOT.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.632
AND NUMBER 69,
YOUR ORDER IS UP.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.068
[laughter]

10:01.101 --> 10:03.737
NO, THAT'S--THAT'S A GOOD--
THAT'S A GOOD JOKE.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.039
I'M SO IMPRESSED
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.741
I PROBABLY WOULD'VE
JUST CLEANED MY ELBOW

10:07.775 --> 10:10.010
WITH GINGER ALE
AND TAPED A SOCK ON IT.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.879
POOR MAN'S HEALTH INSURANCE,
RIGHT?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.413
DO YOU NOT HAVE
HEALTH INSURANCE?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.314
I CAN'T SKATE
THE WAY I NEED TO SKATE

10:14.347 --> 10:16.049
THINKING I'M GONNA
GET HURT, YOU KNOW?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.786
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.689
IF YOU SMILE INTO A MIRROR,
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

10:21.722 --> 10:23.824
MY CROW'S FEET,
THIS ONE FANG I HAVE

10:23.857 --> 10:24.892
THAT I NEED
TO GET SHAVED DOWN.

10:24.925 --> 10:25.693
IT'S THE WORST.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.160
I BELIEVE THE UNIVERSE
IS A MIRROR,

10:27.194 --> 10:29.062
AND IT REFLECTS
WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.064
I LIKE THAT.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.100
SO IF I GET HEALTH INSURANCE,
I'M GONNA GET HURT.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.902
NOPE, IT GOT DUMB AGAIN.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.770
DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES,
BOTH VALID.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.905
THEY'RE NOT BOTH VALID.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.773
WHOOPS-A-DAISY.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.108
I PUT A THUMB-HOLE
THROUGH MY MILKSHAKE.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.777
IT'S ALL LEAKING OUT.
CAN I HAVE SOME OF YOURS?

10:43.811 --> 10:46.780
[mixed chatter]

10:46.814 --> 10:49.683
HEY, THAT WAS SUCH AN
INTERESTING EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.184
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

10:51.218 --> 10:52.753
WE SHOULD GET HIGH.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.054
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAHAM?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.255
I THINK THAT'S GONNA
HAVE TO BE GOOD NIGHT.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.958
MY BODY IS VERY ATTRACTED
TO YOUR BODY,

10:57.991 --> 11:00.460
BUT WHEN YOU SPEAK,
MY BRAIN GETS ANGRY.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.796
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE
STILL COMING OVER, RIGHT?

11:02.830 --> 11:05.265
GET OUR BRONZE MEDAL
AT THE WINTER SEX-GAMES.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.800
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!

11:06.834 --> 11:08.301
WHAT ABOUT THIS EVENING
WOULD MAKE YOU THINK

11:08.335 --> 11:09.770
THAT I WOULD DO THAT?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.739
AND WHY WOULD WE ONLY
GET A BRONZE--

11:11.772 --> 11:12.672
OH.
MY PHONE!

11:12.706 --> 11:14.041
THAT HAS, LIKE,
EIGHT YEARS OF PHOTOS IN IT.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.442
ALL MY SELFIES!

11:15.475 --> 11:17.110
OH.
HYAH!

11:17.144 --> 11:18.311
(Mindy)
OH, MY GOD!

11:18.345 --> 11:19.346
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:19.379 --> 11:20.380
I'M OKAY.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.249
GRAHAM, GET OUT OF THERE!

11:22.282 --> 11:23.450
AHH.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.018
OH, GOD, GET OUT!
GET OUT! GRAHAM!

11:25.052 --> 11:27.220
OH.
I THINK THIS IS YOUR TRAIN.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.989
GRAHAM! GRAHAM!
GET OUT OF THERE!

11:29.022 --> 11:31.124
GRAHAM, I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE

11:31.158 --> 11:33.794
JUST TO SAVE MY CELL PHONE.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.129
THAT IS THE BRAVEST THING
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.975
HI, PETER.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.442
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH MY FATHER LAST NIGHT?

11:49.476 --> 11:50.577
BRO,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.513
I DON'T WANNA SAY THAT WE
ARE THE NEW UNOFFICIAL MAYORS

11:53.546 --> 11:56.449
OF THE ONEIDA INDIAN MOON
RESORT AND CASINO,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.251
BECAUSE THEN I'D BE
REPEATING WHAT IT SAYS

11:58.285 --> 11:59.953
ON MY T-SHIRT!

11:59.987 --> 12:01.388
[laughing]

12:01.421 --> 12:02.990
THESE THINGS ARE FREE.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.492
THEY GIVE THEM TO YOU
WHEN YOU LOSE OVER $5,000.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.794
SOUNDS FUN.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.028
HOW WERE YOU NOT THERE?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.897
WELL, WHEN MY DAD STUMBLED IN
AT 5:00 A.M.,

12:09.930 --> 12:13.967
HE TOLD ME THAT MY INVITE
GOT LOST IN MY PANTY DRAWER!

12:17.037 --> 12:19.006
YO, EVERYBODY!
HOW'S IT GOING?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.240
OH, GOD.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.274
(Morgan)
OH, JEEZ!

12:21.308 --> 12:22.309
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.510
LUCKILY, I HAVE
ALL THESE PADS.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.078
WHAT'S UP WITH THE HELMET,
BRETT FAVRE?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.413
UH, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

12:26.446 --> 12:28.248
I AM DATING
A PROFESSIONAL SKATEBOARDER.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.818
SO THE ONLY THING PICKY ABOUT ME
ARE MY SCABS.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.953
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE DATING
THIS LOSER TO PROVE A POINT?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.823
OR MAYBE I LIKE HIM
AND YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW HIM.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.191
ACTUALLY, YEAH.
WE SHOULD ALL GO OUT FOR DINNER.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.960
YOU COULD INVITE
THAT BORING GIRL.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.361
UNLESS--DID YOU NOT CALL HER
'CAUSE SHE'S SO BORING

12:41.394 --> 12:42.863
AND YOU'RE THE PICKY ONE?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.865
I DON'T--JUST--
IT'S OUR SCHEDULES

12:44.898 --> 12:46.867
AND, YOU KNOW,
PHONE TAG.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.836
I DON'T HAVE THE BELLS
AND WHISTLES PHONE PLAN

12:48.869 --> 12:50.037
WITH NIGHT MINUTES,
I DON'T HAVE IT.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.138
WHY DON'T YOU CALL HER
FROM HERE?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.906
WE'LL ALL GO OUT TO DINNER.
FANTASTIC.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.909
TELL YOUR GUY TO WEAR
HIS FANCIEST DRESS SHORTS.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.911
OKAY. TELL MARY
TO BRING A PERSONALITY.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.180
I WILL.
I WON'T!

13:01.548 --> 13:06.086
GREAT, NOW YOU GOT ME
TOO WORKED UP TO EAT MY MUFFIN.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.223
YOU KNOW, GRAHAM SKATEBOARDED
IN OVER 25 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES,

13:10.257 --> 13:11.491
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA,

13:11.524 --> 13:13.093
BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.261
WELL, IT'S FUN
TO BE A TOURIST,

13:14.294 --> 13:18.098
BUT MARY ACTUALLY
LIVED IN JAPAN.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.100
WHEN I WAS TWO.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.568
OR THREE.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.904
TWO?
LET ME TEXT MY MOM.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.172
THAT'S OKAY, MARY.
WE'RE GOOD.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.306
OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.540
I TEXT HER
EVERY 90 MINUTES ANYWAYS.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.476
WOW, YOUR MOTHER MUST BE
REALLY INTERESTING.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.413
OH, BOY.
SHE COLLECTS COW STUFF.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.883
[clears throat]
GRAHAM, SO PREGNANT MERMAID.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.118
THAT'S A QUIRKY NAME.
HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH THAT?

13:38.151 --> 13:41.354
I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE FERTILITY OF NEW IDEAS.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.023
I SAW ONE.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.057
YOU SAW A MERMAID?

13:44.091 --> 13:46.159
NO, I SAW A PREGNANT MERMAID.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.928
IN A DREAM?
IN BALI.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.997
SHE WAS JUST SUNNING HERSELF
ON A ROCK.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.598
GOD, WHY DO THEY
PUT THIS SOY SAUCE

13:51.631 --> 13:52.966
IN TWO DIFFERENT CONTAINERS?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.034
ONE OF 'EM'S LOW SODIUM.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.936
SO GRAHAM, YOU WERE TELLING US
YOU SAW A MERMAID?

13:55.969 --> 13:58.171
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
I WAS HALLUCINATING,

13:58.205 --> 14:00.573
BECAUSE I WAS DEHYDRATED
FROM SEMEN DEPLETION.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.443
BUT THEN SHE TURNED TO ME
AND SAID,

14:03.476 --> 14:07.014
"PERGILAH DALAM DAMAI."

14:07.047 --> 14:08.949
THAT MEANS "GO IN PEACE"
IN BALINESE.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.317
HERE'S THE CRAZY PART.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.953
I DON'T SPEAK BALINESE.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.555
GOOSEBUMPS MUCH?
[laughing]

14:15.588 --> 14:17.324
GLAD I ASKED.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.628
THERE'S A CHANCE SOME PERSONAL
PHOTOGRAPHS MIGHT POP UP.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.430
DON'T ALLOW THEM TO.
BUT--I'M GONNA TRY.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.531
HEY, BUDDY.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.999
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.567
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS READY TO ROCK?
YEAH.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.069
UM, YES.
OKAY.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.437
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.105
MY NAME
IS DR. JEREMY REED.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.907
AND I GUESS THAT MAKES ME...

14:33.941 --> 14:35.442
DR. PETER PRENTICE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

14:35.475 --> 14:36.509
[light laughter]

14:36.543 --> 14:37.945
ADDING JOKES, ARE WE?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.412
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS A COMEDY ROUTINE.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.048
JUST BANTERING.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.183
LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FIVE
PRELIMINARY SIGNS OF LABOR.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.252
OKAY, BRAXTON HICKS.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.954
NOW WHAT IS THAT?

14:46.987 --> 14:50.991
NO, TONI BRAXTON DID NOT
MARRY TAYLOR HICKS.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.192
[laughter]

14:52.225 --> 14:54.027
SOUL PATROL!

14:54.061 --> 14:55.362
REMEMBER THAT GUY?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.563
(Jeremy)
YOU GUYS LIKE THAT, DO YOU?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.998
YOU PREFER THIS LOUT TO ME?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.967
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET IN LINE
BEHIND MY FATHER!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.101
[all gasp]

15:01.134 --> 15:02.069
WHOA, WHOA.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.636
I THINK WE HAVE
A TECHNICAL GLITCH RIGHT HERE.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.972
I THINK WE GOT
A TECHNICAL GLITCH RIGHT THERE.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.473
YEAH, YEAH.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.674
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.176
GET IT TOGETHER.
GET IT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.011
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE
PAID FOR A FUN BABY SHOW.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.213
UH, WE FIXED IT.
FIXED THE GLITCH.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.647
IT'S THE DOLL.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.083
OKAY, BRAXTON HICKS.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.252
NOW THOSE ARE SPECIFIC
UTERI CONTRACTIONS.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.088
I'M SO SORRY.
I'VE GOT A QUICK QUESTION.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.556
ANY DADS HAVING SONS?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.058
WELL, HELLO, DADS.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.027
LOOK FORWARD TO A LIFETIME
OF DISAPPOINTMENT

15:27.060 --> 15:30.097
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE JEREMIES
CAN'T RIDE A BICYCLE

15:30.130 --> 15:31.198
NO MATTER HOW DRUNK
AND SADISTIC YOU GET.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.165
ALL RIGHT.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.001
ALL RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE SON
IS SAYING,

15:34.034 --> 15:35.368
"I DON'T WANNA GO DOWN
THAT HILL."
WE'RE GONNA GO.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.970
MORGAN?
"MAYBE I WON'T
COME BACK UP THE HILL."

15:37.004 --> 15:39.339
AND MAYBE HE WON'T!
WHOA.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.474
AH, MY NAME IS NURSE MORGAN.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.044
I'M HERE TO NAME YOUR BABIES.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.013
GROVER.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.180
JOHN.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.249
GROVER.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
SO GRAHAM,
SELLING SKATEBOARDS.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.152
MM.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.521
DO YOU PLAN TO BRANCH
INTO POGO STICKS?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.123
I DON'T KNOW.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.724
YOU SPECIALIZE IN VAGINAS.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.226
YOU HOPING TO BRANCH
INTO BOOBS?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.293
[laughing]

16:00.327 --> 16:01.995
I CHECK BOOBS
EVERY DAMN DAY,

16:02.029 --> 16:03.096
SO THE JOKE'S ON YOU.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.398
[laughing]
I LIKE YOU, MAN.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.733
YOU'RE LIKE MY PARENTS.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.536
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY IN
A GATED RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.737
I GET IT.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.239
SOME LIONS LIKE A CAGE.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.540
A CAGE?

16:13.573 --> 16:16.409
UH, MORE LIKE A COOL CONDO
WITH A 15-YEAR FIXED.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.412
YEAH, GRAHAM'S NOT REALLY
LIKE A "MORTGAGE" KIND OF GUY.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.481
HE'S JUST TOO WILD
AND UNPREDICTABLE.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.749
IT'S SEXY,
YOU'RE LIKE A COWBOY.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.184
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

16:24.217 --> 16:25.352
WE SHOULD DINE AND DASH.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.520
THAT WOULD BE HILARIOUS,
GRAHAM,

16:27.554 --> 16:29.156
VIOLATING A SOCIAL CONTRACT.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.258
MINDY, YOU LOVE
THAT KINDA STUFF, RIGHT?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.193
I DO, ACTUALLY.
I'M QUITE WILD.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.028
FOR INSTANCE, MARY,

16:35.062 --> 16:37.497
I USE A MULTIVITAMIN THAT
IS NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.566
YOU KNOW, SUSHI RESTAURANTS
ARE RAPING OUR OCEANS.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.101
IS THAT HOW YOUR MERMAID
GOT PREGNANT?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.670
NO, IT WAS CONSENSUAL SEX
WITH A SEA CAPTAIN.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.338
OH, MY MOM
JUST TEXTED ME BACK.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.673
I WAS WRONG.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.275
I WAS FOUR
WHEN I LIVED IN JAPAN,

16:48.308 --> 16:52.145
AND FROM TWO TO THREE,
WE WERE IN ARIZONA,

16:52.179 --> 16:55.082
THREE TO FOUR, MINNESOTA,
AND THEN, I THINK--

16:55.115 --> 16:55.948
[clears throat]

16:55.982 --> 16:57.450
MINDY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:57.484 --> 16:58.518
JUST REALLY QUICK.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.420
IT'S JUST WORK RELATED.
SURE. LOVE TO.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.388
BYE, GRAHAM.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.722
YOU'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.524
WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT?
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A BRAT.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.592
I AM?
YES.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.060
YOU HAVEN'T LET OFF GRAHAM
SINCE THE EDAMAME ARRIVED.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.295
THEY'RE CALLED SOY BEANS.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.762
THEY'RE FROM IOWA, OKAY?

17:09.796 --> 17:10.597
HOW FAR ARE YOU
GONNA LET THIS GO

17:10.630 --> 17:12.832
BEFORE YOU ADMIT
THAT GUY'S A LOSER?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.402
WHEN I LIKE SOMEONE,
HE'S A LOSER,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.137
AND IF I DON'T LIKE SOMEONE,
I'M TOO PICKY.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.138
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, DANNY?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.706
I DON'T KNOW.
WEB DATING.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.808
OKAY, DON'T GIVE ME ADVICE
ON WHO TO DATE.

17:21.841 --> 17:22.775
BACK OFF, GRANDPA.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.311
THAT'S NOT AN INSULT, OKAY?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.246
GRANDFATHERS ARE THE BACKBONE
OF THIS COUNTRY.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.314
I CAN'T GET INTO THIS
GRANDFATHERS THING WITH YOU.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.481
IT'S ON, DOGS.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.582
WE'RE DINING AND DASHING.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.251
NO, NO. NO.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.652
OH, GOD.
OKAY.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.720
OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

17:33.753 --> 17:34.587
YOU GONNA PAY THE BILL,

17:34.621 --> 17:36.156
OR YOU GONNA RUN OFF
WITH YOUR SOUL MATE?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.224
OKAY, WE'RE GOING.
WE'RE GOING!

17:40.260 --> 17:42.295
(Graham)
OH! OVER THE FENCE!

17:42.329 --> 17:44.364
HERE WE GO!
YEAH!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.498
[fence rattling]

17:45.532 --> 17:48.201
AH. COME ON!
OVER THE FENCE!

17:48.235 --> 17:50.237
[Mary laughing]

17:50.270 --> 17:52.305
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE!

17:52.339 --> 17:54.274
OH, I GOTTA TEXT MY MOM.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.575
GO, DANNY!
GO DO IT!

17:55.608 --> 17:57.244
[exhales]

17:57.277 --> 17:58.845
YAH!

17:58.878 --> 18:00.280
I GOT IT!

18:00.313 --> 18:01.714
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
HELP HIM.
I GOT IT.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.715
DO IT LIKE GRAHAM DID IT.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.716
DO YOU? YOU DO.
I GOT IT.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.717
YEAH, YOU DO!
OH, GOD!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.153
THERE WE GO.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.621
OKAY, IF DANNY CAN DO IT,
I CAN DO IT TOO.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.290
OW! OW!
YOU OKAY?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.591
COME ON, MINDY.
I THINK I HAVE TETANUS.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.193
MOVE YOUR ASS!

18:13.226 --> 18:14.327
EXCUSE ME?

18:14.361 --> 18:15.395
NO, NO, NO!
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!

18:15.428 --> 18:16.196
SLIDE THROUGH THE CRACK.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.364
OKAY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
OKAY.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
I CAN DO THIS.
YOU GOT IT.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.167
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD,
GOOD, GOOD.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.100
(Danny)
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOUR BOOBS ARE SMALL.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.703
I HAVE HUGE CANS.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.837
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.206
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY! OKAY!

18:26.239 --> 18:28.141
COME ON.
YOU CAN DO IT.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.309
RIGHT THERE.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
OKAY, GRAHAM,
I CAN'T DO THIS.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.579
SURE YOU CAN!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.881
JUST SUCK IN YOUR BUTT!

18:34.914 --> 18:36.549
YEAH, MY BODY CAN'T DO THAT.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.351
COME HERE.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.287
LOOK, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
AND CHARISMATIC,

18:40.320 --> 18:44.524
BUT I'M A WOMAN OF SCIENCE
AND YOU ARE MAN OF NON-SCI--

18:44.557 --> 18:46.793
NONSENSE, ACTUALLY.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.261
SO THIS ISN'T
GONNA WORK OUT.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
ALTHOUGH, I WOULD'VE LOVED
TO HAVE HAD SEX WITH YOU

18:50.330 --> 18:51.231
BUT ONCE.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.665
YEAH.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.267
I KINDA THOUGHT THIS
WAS GONNA END IN A FOUR-WAY.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.535
UGH.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.603
THREE-WAY?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.737
WHAT?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.572
TWO-WAY?

18:59.606 --> 19:02.209
ONE-WAY IT IS.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.443
GOOD-BYE, MINDY.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.613
PERGILAH DALAM DAMAI.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.553
OH, BOTHER.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.522
MY FAVORITE COMMERCIAL
RIGHT NOW

19:15.555 --> 19:16.889
IS THE ONE WHERE IT'S A BABY

19:16.923 --> 19:18.825
BUT HE TALKS
IN A MAN'S VOICE.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.261
IT'S REALLY FUNNY,

19:21.294 --> 19:22.662
AND IT REALLY MAKES ME LAUGH.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.432
MM.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.400
[snorts]

19:27.434 --> 19:28.901
DID YOU JUST FALL ASLEEP?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.338
NO! I'M NOT SL--
I'M AWAKE.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.906
IT'S A BIG NIGHT,
LOT OF SAKE AND...

19:33.940 --> 19:36.343
MY SWEATER'S A LITTLE--
IT'S HEAVY FOR THIS WEATHER.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.345
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TONIGHT WAS REALLY FUN,

19:38.378 --> 19:40.413
BUT AFTER MEETING GRAHAM,
I JUST REALIZED

19:40.447 --> 19:43.250
THAT I NEED SOMEONE
WITH MORE PERSONALITY.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.452
BYE.
[scoffs]

19:45.485 --> 19:47.520
[exhales]

19:50.490 --> 19:52.692
HEY, CHAPPELLE!
WHAT'S WITH THE MELTDOWN?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.794
I'M AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO MY FATHER,

19:54.827 --> 19:57.897
TO MY FAMILY, TO THE ENTIRE
REED RIDING CROP EMPIRE.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.633
YOU? AN EMBARRASSMENT?
I "B" TO "D."

20:00.667 --> 20:02.469
WHAT?
I BEG TO DIFF.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.371
SPEAK IN ENGLISH.
SPEAK IN FULL WORDS.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.306
YOU CAME
TO A WHOLE NEW COUNTRY,

20:06.339 --> 20:08.975
BECAME THE HEAD DOCTOR
OF AN AWESOME PRACTICE,

20:09.008 --> 20:12.245
YOU LEARNED TO DRIVE ON
THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

20:12.279 --> 20:15.348
AND YOU TOOK A CHANCE ON
A RUDE DUDE WITH A BAD 'TUDE

20:15.382 --> 20:16.283
WHEN NO ONE WOULD.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.618
HUH? I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF NOT FOR YOU.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.987
SO IN MY BOOK,
YOU ARE ALWAYS BALLER STATUS.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.290
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.292
I AM BALLER STATUS.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.294
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IF THERE'S ANYONE

20:27.327 --> 20:29.762
THAT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO YOUR FAMILY, IT'S YOUR DAD.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.264
I MEAN, AT THE CASINO
LAST NIGHT,

20:31.298 --> 20:33.300
HE WAS SCAMMING
ON SOME PRETTY ROUGH

20:33.333 --> 20:34.534
MONDAY NIGHT PROSTITUTES.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.303
DAD DOES LIKE HIS PROSIES.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.705
NOW BRING IT IN!

20:41.941 --> 20:44.544
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.978
I CAME BACK TO PAY.

20:46.012 --> 20:46.813
REALLY?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.348
MARY DIDN'T RUN OUT
OF INTERNET VIDEOS

20:48.381 --> 20:49.215
TO PARTIALLY REMEMBER?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.050
I FELL ASLEEP
WHILE SHE WAS TALKING.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.184
OH, MY GOD.
YEAH.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.554
AND I DIDN'T EVEN WAKE UP
WHEN SHE STARTED KISSING ME.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.688
WHAT?
LOOK.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.789
HOW OFTEN IS THAT
HAPPENING TO YOU

20:56.823 --> 20:57.757
THAT YOU GIVE UP
THOSE OPPOR--OKAY.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.459
CAN WE JUST ADMIT
THAT WE WERE BOTH DUMB?

20:59.492 --> 21:02.362
THAT WE WERE BOTH DATING SOMEONE
TO PROVE A POINT?

21:02.395 --> 21:05.031
OKAY, IT BEGAN AS ME
TRYING TO PROVE A POINT.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.533
OKAY.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.034
BUT IT EVOLVED
INTO A VERY DEEP NEED

21:08.067 --> 21:09.101
FOR ME TO HAVE SEX
WITH HIM.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.371
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
AND I HOPE THAT NEED
GOES AWAY.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.572
I DON'T GET THE TATTOO THING.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.307
HE LOOKED LIKE THE WALL
OF A BAR BATHROOM.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.443
I THOUGHT
IT WAS SUPER HOT.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.846
IN FACT, I WAS THINKING
OF GETTING A TATTOO ON MY WRIST

21:19.879 --> 21:21.414
THAT SAYS "BREATHE."
BREATHE?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.281
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU FORGET TO DO?

21:22.315 --> 21:24.050
WHY DON'T YOU PUT "WALK"
ON YOUR FEET?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.085
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING
"IDIOT" ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.487
OKAY.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.889
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'RE GONNA DIS ME,

21:29.922 --> 21:31.090
DON'T EAT ALL OF MY DESSERT!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.959
GO TO BED.
