WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.759
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.800
( cheering, whistle
tweeting on TV )

00:10.801 --> 00:12.011
- OH, THREE-POINTER! WE GOT IT!
- YES!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.933
WE'RE UP BY SIX NOW.
WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:13.934 --> 00:15.685
WHY DO GUYS SAY "WE"
WHEN THEY WATCH SPORTS?

00:15.686 --> 00:17.687
I MEAN, WOMEN DON'T WATCH
THE CHEERLEADERS AND SAY,

00:17.688 --> 00:20.690
"UH, WE ARE SUCH
AWESOME DANCERS."

00:20.691 --> 00:22.692
SPEAKING OF AWESOME DANCERS...

00:22.693 --> 00:24.814
CHECK OUT THE
POM-POMS ON THAT ONE.

00:24.815 --> 00:27.608
OH MY GOD, DUDE, SHE IS SO...

00:28.819 --> 00:29.780
NOT MY TYPE.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.533
OH, MAN, IT IS SO
NICE I CAN ADMIT

00:33.534 --> 00:35.034
THAT I FIND OTHER WOMEN
ATTRACTIVE AGAIN.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.826
- ( slightly chuckles )
- IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED,

00:36.827 --> 00:39.419
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND THAT
YOUR SEX DRIVE DIED...

00:39.420 --> 00:41.791
ALONG WITH ALL YOUR OPINIONS.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.793
GEE, CHARLIE,

00:43.794 --> 00:46.005
IT IS SUCH A MYSTERY HOW YOUR
MARRIAGE DIDN'T SURVIVE.

00:46.006 --> 00:47.507
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,

00:47.508 --> 00:50.430
GETTING DIVORCED WAS THE BEST
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

00:50.431 --> 00:52.262
DIVORCE WAS PRETTY GOOD
FOR ME TOO, BUDDY.

00:52.263 --> 00:53.264
( chuckles )

00:54.885 --> 00:56.976
OTHERWISE, I NEVER WOULD
HAVE MET YOU, RIGHT, HONEY?

00:56.977 --> 00:58.888
RIGHT...

00:58.889 --> 01:00.850
HEY, MEL, YOU KNOW, BACK
IN BUSINESS SCHOOL,

01:00.851 --> 01:03.233
JOE HERE USED TO HAVE, LIKE, A
DIFFERENT CHICK EVERY NIGHT.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.235
- WELL... ( chuckles )
- HIS BUSINESS WAS BOOMING.

01:05.236 --> 01:07.026
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.238
I'M SURPRISED HE GAVE THAT UP.

01:08.239 --> 01:10.110
WELL, YOU KNOW, BEING
WITH ME IS LIKE

01:10.111 --> 01:11.491
BEING WITH A DIFFERENT
WOMAN EVERY NIGHT.

01:11.492 --> 01:14.655
OH, YEAH. HORMONAL THING, RIGHT?

01:15.956 --> 01:19.999
IT SO LUCKY FOR US WOMEN THAT
YOU ARE BACK ON THE MARKET.

MORNING, JOE.

01:44.485 --> 01:46.276
MORNING, MEL. OH, HEY, UM...

01:46.277 --> 01:49.489
SO, LOOK, SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING
TO THIS MUSEUM WORK THING TONIGHT,

01:49.490 --> 01:51.110
I THINK I'M GONNA GO HIT UP A
COUPLE OF BARS WITH CHARLIE.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.942
OHH, SO YOU'RE GOING BAR-HOPPING

01:52.943 --> 01:54.234
WITH YOUR HORNDOG PAL.

01:54.235 --> 01:56.536
ARE YOU GONNA GET THERE
IN TIME FOR SLEAZY HOUR

01:56.537 --> 01:58.328
OR IS THAT JUST WHAT THEY CALL
IT WHEN CHARLIE GETS THERE?

01:58.329 --> 02:00.580
I'M TRYING TO BE A SUPPORTIVE
FRIEND HERE, HONEY.

02:00.581 --> 02:02.081
HE ASKED ME TO BE HIS
WINGMAN, I'M GONNA GO.

02:02.082 --> 02:03.793
TALK HIM UP TO THE LADIES, YOU
KNOW, MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD.

02:03.794 --> 02:06.005
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT OF TALKING.

02:06.006 --> 02:07.207
YOU REALLY WANNA DO THIS?

02:07.208 --> 02:08.668
WHAT'S THE MATTER? HUH?

02:08.669 --> 02:09.839
YOU DON'T TRUST ME AT A BAR?

02:09.840 --> 02:11.461
OF COURSE I TRUST YOU.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.052
I JUST DON'T TRUST CHARLIE.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.014
BUT, YOU KNOW...
FINE, YOU CAN GO.

02:15.015 --> 02:17.387
OH, SO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION?

02:17.388 --> 02:19.809
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, DO
WHATEVER YOU LIKE, SWEETIE.

02:19.810 --> 02:22.892
BECAUSE AS WE BOTH
KNOW, I TRUST YOU.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.354
THANK YOU. MWAH.

02:24.355 --> 02:25.395
- HAVE FUN.
- ( laughs )

02:25.396 --> 02:26.396
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN THAT, DO YOU?

02:26.397 --> 02:27.898
- NOT AT ALL.
- OKAY.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.982
THEN SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR
TELLS CASSANDRA THAT

02:32.983 --> 02:35.074
HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE MERELY JUST

02:35.075 --> 02:38.278
A SOCIETAL CONSTRUCT
OF THE PATRIARCHY.

02:38.279 --> 02:39.950
SURE, I CAN ANIMATE THAT.

02:40.781 --> 02:41.911
SPEAKING OF HETEROSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS,

02:41.912 --> 02:43.203
HOW'S YOURS GOING?

02:43.204 --> 02:44.874
YOU, UH, HANGING OUT WITH
EMERSON THIS WEEKEND?

02:44.875 --> 02:45.786
WE BROKE UP.

02:45.787 --> 02:47.587
( gasps )

02:47.588 --> 02:48.788
DON'T LOOK SURPRISED.

02:48.789 --> 02:50.420
RYDER TOLD ME THAT HE TOLD YOU.

02:50.421 --> 02:53.793
OH, YEAH, IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME NOW.

02:53.794 --> 02:55.715
THERE IT IS! ANYHOO...

02:55.716 --> 02:58.508
ORIGINALLY, WE BROKE UP 'CAUSE OF
THE WHOLE LONG-DISTANCE THING,

02:58.509 --> 03:00.930
BUT WE'RE SHORT-DISTANCE NOW...

03:00.931 --> 03:01.852
LIKE TWO FEET.

03:03.894 --> 03:05.515
- SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS?
- OKAY.

03:05.516 --> 03:07.016
ZANDER, NO.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.808
I'M JUST NOT FOCUSED ON
BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP

03:08.809 --> 03:09.899
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

03:09.900 --> 03:11.731
I NEED TO WIDEN MY HORIZONS,

03:11.732 --> 03:13.022
AND YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME.

03:13.023 --> 03:14.314
EXPAND YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS

03:14.315 --> 03:16.816
BEYOND, YOU KNOW, ME.

03:16.817 --> 03:18.948
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I
AM EXPANDING MY CIRCLE.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.661
I'M SEEING A HOUSE-SHARE ON
EMMYLOU'S LIST TOMORROW.

03:21.662 --> 03:22.782
TWO STUDENTS NEED
A THIRD ROOMMATE,

03:22.783 --> 03:25.376
AND THAT WOULD EXPAND
MY CIRCLE BY TWO.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.498
EMMYLOU'S LIST? ISN'T
THAT THAT SITE

03:28.499 --> 03:30.290
THAT HAD THE SERIAL
CANNIBAL MURDERER

03:30.291 --> 03:31.671
EATING EVERYBODY?

03:31.672 --> 03:34.043
NAH, THAT'S AN URBAN LEGEND.

03:34.044 --> 03:35.795
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

03:35.796 --> 03:39.008
THIS GUY WOULD POST THAT HE
NEEDED ROOMMATES, RIGHT?

03:39.009 --> 03:41.180
AND WHEN THE FRESH-FACED STUDENT
SHOWED UP FOR THE INTERVIEW,

03:41.181 --> 03:44.054
HE'D EAT THEIR FRESH FACES.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.306
GOOD LUCK APARTMENT-HUNTING.

03:46.307 --> 03:47.727
- RYDER!
- HEY! OKAY!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.228
I'M SORRY. I'M SURE NOT EVERYONE

03:49.229 --> 03:52.523
WHO HAS A ROOM FOR RENT
WANTS TO EAT YOUR FACE.

03:53.564 --> 03:55.985
SO ABOUT THAT THING TOMORROW...

03:55.986 --> 03:57.947
IT'S MORE OF LIKE AN
INTERVIEW, SO MAYBE,

03:57.948 --> 03:58.859
YOU WANNA COME WITH ME.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.070
YOU KNOW? TALK ME UP,
MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

04:01.071 --> 04:03.454
AND CALL THE POLICE IF SOMEONE
TRIES TO BAKE YOU IN A PIE.

04:04.825 --> 04:05.955
NO, THAT'S SILLY...

04:05.956 --> 04:07.418
YOU'RE COMING, THOUGH, RIGHT?

04:09.370 --> 04:12.962
( dance music playing )

04:12.963 --> 04:15.796
THE POND IS WELL
STOCKED TONIGHT.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.430
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER?

04:20.431 --> 04:21.801
SHE WAS LOOKING AT YOU.

04:21.802 --> 04:23.883
IN FACT, EVERY WOMAN
WHO'S HERE BY HERSELF

04:23.884 --> 04:25.054
IS JUST GONNA WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

04:25.055 --> 04:27.647
- ( sighs )
- YOU'RE TOO DAMN GOOD LOOKING.

04:27.648 --> 04:30.229
IT CAN BE A CURSE.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.651
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

04:31.652 --> 04:32.982
THE TWO-ON-ONE IS
NOT GONNA WORK.

04:32.983 --> 04:33.814
NEW STRATEGY.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.986
WE TRY THE PICK-OFF, ALL RIGHT?

04:36.987 --> 04:38.738
UM... LOOK AT THOSE TWO.

04:38.739 --> 04:40.530
I TAKE THE BRUNETTE,
YOU TAKE THE REDHEAD.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.821
DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.202
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

04:43.203 --> 04:44.784
I'M JUST REALLY HERE TO
TALK YOU UP TO THE LADIES.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.616
I'M NOT HERE TO CONQUER
ANYTHING MYSELF.

04:46.617 --> 04:47.867
NO, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.999
JUST PEEL THAT ONE AWAY SO I
CAN TALK TO THE BRUNETTE.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.461
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF SHE
GETS TOO INTERESTED?

04:51.462 --> 04:53.623
WHEN LADIES START
TALKING TO THIS...

04:53.624 --> 04:55.174
IT HAPPENS.

04:55.175 --> 04:56.966
COME ON. IT'S JUST FLIRTING.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.218
CATCH AND RELEASE, MAN.
YOU KNOW.

04:59.219 --> 05:02.972
REEL HER IN AND THEN SET THAT GUPPY FREE.
THAT'S IT.

05:02.973 --> 05:06.806
OH, AND DON'T MENTION YOU
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, ALL RIGHT?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.689
APPARENTLY, THAT'S A
TURN-OFF FOR SOME WOMEN.

05:09.690 --> 05:11.811
- I DON'T KNOW, CHARLIE.
- FOR ME, JOE. COME ON.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.603
DO THIS ONE FOR ME, PLEASE?

05:13.604 --> 05:15.234
I GOT A GOOD GIRL AT HOME, MAN.

05:15.235 --> 05:16.486
I DON'T WANT TO PARTAKE
IN ANYTHING THAT COULD

05:16.487 --> 05:17.777
- GET SKETCHY.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

05:17.778 --> 05:20.199
OKAY, I SEE. YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT ANYMORE, RIGHT?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.781
IS THAT IT? YOU THINK
YOU'VE LOST YOUR GAME?

05:21.782 --> 05:23.783
WAIT A SECOND. BACK UP, DUDE.

05:23.784 --> 05:27.827
FIRST OF ALL, I CREATED GAME.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.120
I COULD GET THE NUMBER OF ALL THESE WOMEN
IN HERE IF I WANTED TO, ALL RIGHT?

05:31.121 --> 05:33.953
HALF THE GUYS IF I
WAS SO INCLINED.

05:33.954 --> 05:35.044
WATCH AND LEARN.

05:35.045 --> 05:37.627
LADIES, GOOD EVENING.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.958
- HI.
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.630
LET'S JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.882
ARE WE THE FOUR HOTTEST PEOPLE
IN HERE TONIGHT, OR WHAT?

05:42.883 --> 05:44.884
YOU TWO PLAY YOUR CARDS
RIGHT, AND CHARLIE AND I

05:44.885 --> 05:46.265
MAY LET YOU HANG OUT WITH US.

05:46.266 --> 05:48.177
OH, LUCKY US.

05:48.178 --> 05:49.389
( chuckles )

05:49.390 --> 05:51.270
I'M DARCY. AND YOU ARE?

05:51.271 --> 05:52.892
BUY ME A DRINK AND
I'LL TELL YOU.

05:52.893 --> 05:53.973
OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE
WORTH A DRINK?

05:53.974 --> 05:56.477
SEVERAL. AND ALL TOP SHELF.

05:57.778 --> 05:59.358
COME ON, LET'S LEAVE
THESE TWO ALONE.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.981
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT TO
HIT IT OFF AS WELL AS WE ARE.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.783
OH, YOU'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT.

06:03.784 --> 06:05.364
WELL, IT'S NOT ME, IT'S YOU.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.367
YOU'RE JUST BRINGING
ME OUT OF MY SHELL.

06:15.165 --> 06:17.166
OH, HEY, MAN.

06:17.167 --> 06:18.628
HEY.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.880
( tires squeal, car crashes
through computer )

06:20.881 --> 06:22.381
WOW.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.673
YOU'RE HITTING A
LOT OF CARS THERE.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.214
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S
PART OF THE GAME.

06:25.215 --> 06:28.267
IT'S CALLED "ANGRY VALET."

06:28.268 --> 06:30.931
AND I JUST WON. ( chuckles )

06:32.392 --> 06:34.604
( sighs ) SO WHAT ARE THESE?

06:34.605 --> 06:36.105
WHAT ARE WHAT? OH, THOSE...

06:36.106 --> 06:38.818
"ANGIE, LISA,

06:38.819 --> 06:40.780
TESSA..."

06:40.781 --> 06:42.281
WHAT, GIRLS NUMBERS ON NAPKINS?

06:42.282 --> 06:45.485
WHAT ARE THESE, FOSSILS
FROM THE '80s OR SOMETHING?

06:45.486 --> 06:49.118
NO, NO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT
ANY EVIDENCE ON MY PHONE.

06:49.119 --> 06:50.700
- EVIDENCE?
- DID I JUST SAY "EVIDENCE"?

06:50.701 --> 06:53.533
I DIDN'T MEAN EVIDENCE. I
MEANT EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION.

06:53.534 --> 06:56.205
I WAS OUT TONIGHT HITTING A
COUPLE BARS WITH CHARLIE.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.877
YOU KNOW, HELPING HIM
TO MEET THE LADIES.

06:57.878 --> 06:59.499
HOW COME YOU HAVE ALL
THE PHONE NUMBERS THEN?

06:59.500 --> 07:02.632
I HAVE THE PHONE NUMBERS
BECAUSE I WAS THE WINGMAN.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.804
SO IT WAS MY JOB TO TAKE
ONE OF THE GIRLS AWAY

07:04.805 --> 07:06.305
SO HE COULD SWOOP IN
AND WORK HIS MAGIC.

07:06.306 --> 07:07.426
IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.308
JOE, ARE YOU SWEATING?

07:09.309 --> 07:11.220
AM I... NO, NO, DUDE.
I'M NOT... NO.

07:11.221 --> 07:13.392
I'M NOT SWEATING.
I'M NOT SWEATING.

07:13.393 --> 07:14.854
NO NO NO.

07:14.855 --> 07:16.896
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M NOT GONNA BE CALLING

07:16.897 --> 07:18.648
ANY ONE OF THESE
EIGHT OR NINE GIRLS.

07:18.649 --> 07:21.110
NOT EVEN, UH...
NOT EVEN CYNTHIA,

07:21.111 --> 07:23.442
WHO WAS... OH MY GOD, DUDE.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.616
SEE, IT'S CALLED CATCH
AND RELEASE, PAL.

07:26.617 --> 07:27.907
YOU GET THE GIRL ON THE HOOK AND
THEN YOU THROW HER BACK IN.

07:27.908 --> 07:29.158
TOTALLY INNOCENT.

07:29.159 --> 07:30.780
- WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
- BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!

07:30.781 --> 07:32.201
ALL RIGHT?

07:32.202 --> 07:33.372
IT WAS ACTUALLY... YOU
KNOW WHAT IT WAS?

07:33.373 --> 07:34.624
IT WAS AN ACT OF CHARITY.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.996
THAT YOU WOULD RATHER
AUNT MEL NOT KNOW ABOUT.

07:36.997 --> 07:38.788
WELL, YEAH. DUDE...

07:38.789 --> 07:41.841
YOU DON'T DO CHARITY WORK
AND THEN BRAG ABOUT IT.

07:41.842 --> 07:43.793
I'M THROWING THESE
NUMBERS AWAY RIGHT NOW.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.384
HOLD UP. THOSE NUMBERS,

07:45.385 --> 07:47.887
THEY'RE OF AVAILABLE WOMEN
WHO WOULD SLEEP WITH SOMEONE

07:47.888 --> 07:49.008
THEY HARDLY KNOW, RIGHT?

07:49.009 --> 07:51.470
- PRETTY MUCH.
- CAN I HAVE ONE?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.222
RYDER, COME ON.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.804
YOU KNOW THE OLD EXPRESSION.
( chuckles )

07:54.805 --> 07:57.017
NOPE.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.810
- OH, HEY.
- HEY.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.942
SO HOW DID IT GO LAST
NIGHT, MIGHTY WINGMAN?

08:02.943 --> 08:04.363
GOOD.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.866
NOT GREAT THOUGH.
DEFINITELY NOT GREAT.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.988
YEAH, WELL I WAS WRONG
NOT TO TRUST YOU.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.821
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU SAID YOU
TRUSTED ME COMPLETELY.

08:11.822 --> 08:13.913
YEAH... I DIDN'T.

08:13.914 --> 08:16.115
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS
FEELS SO MUCH BETTER,

08:16.116 --> 08:18.708
BEING TOTALLY HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.040
HEY, WHAT'S THIS? "MEGAN 653"...

08:21.041 --> 08:23.002
OOH, THAT'S MINE.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.294
OH, YEAH. YEAH THAT'S THE NUMBER

08:25.295 --> 08:27.296
OF THAT GIRL THAT YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T GONNA CALL, RIGHT?

08:27.297 --> 08:28.838
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

08:28.839 --> 08:30.129
WAIT, YOU GOT A GIRL'S NUMBER

08:30.130 --> 08:32.632
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL HER?

08:32.633 --> 08:34.934
YES, APPARENTLY
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

08:34.935 --> 08:37.226
THAT'S TERRIBLE. I DON'T WANT
YOU TO BE ONE OF THESE GUYS

08:37.227 --> 08:38.978
THAT GETS A GIRL'S NUMBER
THEN JUST FORGETS ABOUT HER.

08:38.979 --> 08:41.941
THIS GIRL IS A HUMAN BEING.
SHE IS WAITING FOR THAT CALL.

08:41.942 --> 08:44.814
( scoffs ) YEAH, RYDER.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.777
YOU REALLY DIDN'T THINK
THIS THROUGH, DID YOU, PAL?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.909
OOH, NO, I DID NOT.

08:49.910 --> 08:51.781
OH, JOE, IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HERE

08:51.782 --> 08:54.614
SO YOU CAN IMPART THESE
VALUABLE LESSONS ONTO ME.

08:54.615 --> 08:58.958
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE THE WINGMAN
IN MY LIFE, YOU KNOW?

08:58.959 --> 09:01.831
I LIKE TO HELP THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.963
WELL, JOE, YOU GOT THIS.

09:03.964 --> 09:06.046
( chuckles ) I'LL TAKE
CARE OF IT, HONEY.

09:09.219 --> 09:10.720
YOU KNOW, FOR CANNIBALS,

09:10.721 --> 09:12.381
THESE GUYS HAVE
BEAUTIFUL PLANTS.

09:12.382 --> 09:15.845
I WONDER WHAT THEY
USE FOR FERTILIZER?

09:15.846 --> 09:17.226
YES. ( chuckles )

09:17.227 --> 09:19.178
A FUNNY JOKE ABOUT
ME BEING MURDERED.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.270
- ( chuckles )
- ( door opens )

09:21.642 --> 09:23.312
HI. YOU MUST BE ZANDER.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.313
I'M CHRIS.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.985
OH, YOU'RE A GIRL.

09:25.986 --> 09:28.237
HOW ABOUT THAT? CHRIS IS A GIRL.

09:28.238 --> 09:29.568
I SAW.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.991
AND I'M JORDAN.

09:31.992 --> 09:33.993
JORDAN'S A GIRL TOO.

09:33.994 --> 09:35.865
COME IN. BUT PLEASE
TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.406
WE KICK IT ASIAN STYLE.

09:37.407 --> 09:38.909
I LOVE ASIAN STYLE.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.701
AND KICKIN' IT.

09:41.702 --> 09:43.963
UM, OKAY.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.204
IT'S FINE.

09:45.205 --> 09:46.626
DON'T WAIT FOR ME!

09:46.627 --> 09:47.628
- OOH!
- ( clatters )

09:49.299 --> 09:50.880
I'M DOING A "CREATE
YOUR OWN MAJOR"...

09:50.881 --> 09:53.803
THE IMPACT OF IMPERIALISM
ON FEMALE SEXUALITY...

09:53.804 --> 09:55.385
AND JORDAN STUDIES DANCE.

09:57.427 --> 09:59.218
WOW, YOU CAN KICK THAT HIGH.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.600
DID YOU SEE THAT?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.142
WHAT THAT GIANT STEP
BACK FOR FEMINISM?

10:03.143 --> 10:05.524
YES, I DID.

10:05.525 --> 10:08.728
ANYHOW, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A ROOMMATE WHO'S CHILL.

10:08.729 --> 10:11.190
OH, I'M CHILL. SO CHILL.

10:11.191 --> 10:13.492
ALMOST FROZEN.

10:13.493 --> 10:14.784
WE'RE NOT UPTIGHT HERE.

10:14.785 --> 10:17.196
YOU CAN WALK AROUND IN YOUR
UNDERWEAR IF YOU WANT.

10:17.197 --> 10:19.118
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.741
I'LL KEEP AN OPEN
MIND ABOUT THAT.

10:21.742 --> 10:23.202
SO IS THIS YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

10:23.203 --> 10:26.205
NO. UH-UH. NO NO.

10:26.206 --> 10:27.797
NO, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.008
NO, I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

10:29.009 --> 10:30.379
ME NEITHER.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.630
OR A BOYFRIEND.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.802
OR WHATEVER.

10:32.803 --> 10:35.134
( both chuckle )

10:35.135 --> 10:37.346
SO, ZANDER, I HAVE TO CONFESS.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.759
WE LOOKED YOU UP ONLINE.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.221
WE LOVE YOUR "CASSANDRA"
WEB SERIES.

10:42.222 --> 10:45.224
- SUCH GREAT STORIES.
- THANK YOU.

10:45.225 --> 10:48.607
ACTUALLY, THE SERIES IS
BASED ON MY SHORT STORIES.

10:48.608 --> 10:50.189
THAT ARE MINE.

10:50.190 --> 10:52.071
WRITTEN BY ME.

10:52.072 --> 10:53.943
GREAT.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.404
THE ROOM THAT'S AVAILABLE
ISN'T THAT BIG.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.867
BUT BONUS, WE DO HAVE A HOT TUB.

10:57.868 --> 11:00.619
IT'S SMALL, BUT IT FITS THREE
IF YOU DON'T MIND GETTING COZY.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.782
COME SEE.

11:03.623 --> 11:04.874
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN CARE

11:04.875 --> 11:06.546
IF THEY TURN OUT
TO BE CANNIBALS.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.922
IT'S BEEN HOURS.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.794
IS IT WEIRD THAT I
HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET?

11:14.795 --> 11:16.215
IT'LL BE SUCH A GREAT
PLACE TO LIVE.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.387
I DON'T THINK SO.
IT WAS CRAMPED,

11:18.388 --> 11:21.010
AND THERE WAS THIS REALLY
ODD SMELL IN THE KITCHEN.

11:21.011 --> 11:22.853
THE GIRLS WERE BAKING COOKIES.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.895
HOLD UP. YOU'RE
LIVING WITH GIRLS?

11:25.896 --> 11:27.606
IF THINGS WORK OUT, YEAH.

11:27.607 --> 11:29.608
CHRIS AND JORDAN. HERE THEY ARE.

11:29.609 --> 11:31.190
OH MY GOD.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.772
HOT GIRLS WHO BAKE COOKIES.

11:32.773 --> 11:34.814
YOU NEED TO LIVE THERE.

11:34.815 --> 11:36.986
UH, WHY DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE
OF THEM ON YOUR PHONE?

11:36.987 --> 11:39.118
OH, I WAS TAKING A PICTURE
OF WHAT COULD BE MY BEDROOM

11:39.119 --> 11:41.450
AND THEY PHOTO BOMBED THE SHOT.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.872
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

11:42.873 --> 11:43.824
THEY'RE JUMPING ON MY BED.

11:43.825 --> 11:45.034
WOW.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.917
SHE IS SUPER FLEXIBLE.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.749
- COULD YOU EMAIL THAT TO ME?
- YES.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.881
OKAY, STOP THAT. PUT
YOUR PHONE AWAY.

11:51.882 --> 11:53.883
LOOK, I JUST... SERIOUSLY,

11:53.884 --> 11:55.795
I THINK IT'S IN A REALLY
SKETCHY NEIGHBORHOOD,

11:55.796 --> 11:57.887
AND I FOUND A PLACE
THAT'S A LOT BETTER.

11:57.888 --> 11:59.218
HERE, CHECK THIS OUT.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.841
LOOK, NO ROOMMATES
TO BOTHER YOU,

12:01.842 --> 12:03.803
LOTS OF SPACE, FRESH AIR.

12:03.804 --> 12:06.806
UH-HUH. IT'S ON A FARM...

12:06.807 --> 12:09.810
AND I'D HAVE TO SHOVEL MANURE.

12:11.191 --> 12:13.442
YEAH, BUT DID YOU SEE THE PRICE?

12:13.443 --> 12:14.523
IT'S A REALLY GOOD DEAL.

12:14.524 --> 12:17.987
AND... THERE'S GOATS.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.528
I'D STILL GO WITH GIRLS...

12:19.529 --> 12:20.620
AND I LOVE GOATS.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.866
SO WHY ARE YOU SO AGAINST THIS?

12:26.867 --> 12:28.287
WAIT, HOLD... ( gasps )

12:28.288 --> 12:29.959
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

12:29.960 --> 12:31.500
WHAT? NO.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.292
THAT'S... THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:33.293 --> 12:35.044
THAT'S LIKE SCIENCE FICTION

12:35.045 --> 12:37.677
OF STRANGE WORLDS
THAT COULD NEVER BE.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.009
DOESN'T MATTER.

12:40.010 --> 12:40.801
IT'S PROBABLY NOT
GONNA HAPPEN ANYWAY.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.551
I'M NOT COOL ENOUGH FOR THEM.

12:42.552 --> 12:43.722
( cellphone rings )

12:43.723 --> 12:45.644
( gasps ) HOLY CRAP,
I AM COOL ENOUGH!

12:45.645 --> 12:47.386
CHRIS SAYS I CAN
MOVE IN RIGHT AWAY,

12:47.387 --> 12:49.558
AND THERE'S A HOT TUB PARTY
TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE.

12:49.559 --> 12:51.350
( gasps )

12:51.351 --> 12:54.604
THERE'S A MIDNIGHT SHEEP
SHEARING AT THE FARM.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.361
SO, NOT THAT I DON'T LOVE COMING
TO YOUR WORK FUNCTIONS WITH YOU,

13:02.362 --> 13:03.823
BUT HOW LONG DO WE
HAVE TO STAY HERE?

13:03.824 --> 13:05.825
AT LEAST UNTIL I CAN FIND THE NEW
DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.246
I'VE GOT TO GO SAY "HI."

13:07.247 --> 13:09.118
WELL, I'LL HELP YOU FIND HER.
WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

13:09.119 --> 13:11.040
- OH, THAT'S HER OVER THERE.
- OH, GOOD. LET'S GO SAY HI,

13:11.041 --> 13:12.711
'CAUSE THE SOONER WE SAY HI,
THE SOONER WE CAN GET...

13:12.712 --> 13:14.293
OH... ( clears throat )

13:14.294 --> 13:16.755
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY? ARE YOU
SURE YOU WANT TO SAY HI TO HER,

13:16.756 --> 13:18.878
BECAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE
A BORING SUIT TO ME.

13:18.879 --> 13:21.630
THERE'S SO MANY COOLER PEOPLE
HERE THAT WE COULD BE TALKING TO.

13:21.631 --> 13:25.054
LIKE... OH, WHAT ABOUT THAT
GUY IN THE ASCOT? HE LOOKS...

13:25.055 --> 13:27.386
VERY INTERESTING.

13:27.387 --> 13:29.929
I BET HE LIVES ON A YACHT.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.520
NO, OKAY LOOK. COME WITH ME.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.352
I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME,
SO YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

13:33.353 --> 13:35.604
SHE'LL SAY HER NAME AND THEN
I WON'T LOOK LIKE SOME DIVA

13:35.605 --> 13:37.356
WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED
TO LEARN ANYONE'S NAME.

13:37.357 --> 13:39.198
- IT'S DARCY.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

13:39.199 --> 13:40.900
( stammering ) HOW DO I...
BECAUSE...

13:40.901 --> 13:44.823
BECAUSE I'VE... I
READ HER NAME TAG.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.785
WHAT NAME TAG?

13:46.786 --> 13:48.617
OH, IT'S... MUST
HAVE FALLEN OFF.

13:48.618 --> 13:50.369
HONEY, YOU'RE GETTING CAUGHT
UP IN THE DETAILS HERE.

13:50.370 --> 13:51.911
COME ON, WE'RE AT A PARTY.

13:51.912 --> 13:54.793
- HELLO, COUNCILWOMAN.
- OH, HI.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.755
HEY. OH.

13:56.756 --> 13:58.837
WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO
SEE YOU HERE, DAMIEN.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.960
NO, THIS ISN'T DAMIEN.
THIS IS JOE.

14:00.961 --> 14:03.303
NO, THIS IS DAMIEN DEL MARCO.

14:04.674 --> 14:07.677
SPECIAL AGENT DAMIEN
DEL MARCO, RIGHT?

14:11.141 --> 14:13.392
THERE SEEMS TO BE A
LITTLE CONFUSION HERE.

14:13.393 --> 14:14.643
( gasps )

14:14.644 --> 14:16.476
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BLOW YOUR COVER.

14:18.028 --> 14:20.029
BUT I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU AGAIN.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.440
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME?

14:21.441 --> 14:22.942
YEAH.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.114
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED HER?

14:26.196 --> 14:27.786
HOLD ON.

14:27.787 --> 14:29.488
IS THIS YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

14:29.489 --> 14:33.202
YES.

14:33.203 --> 14:36.835
MY BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND.

14:36.836 --> 14:40.049
THEN WHY WERE YOU IN
A BAR HITTING ON ME?

14:40.050 --> 14:42.461
UM, WAIT A MINUTE NOW.
IN ALL FAIRNESS,

14:42.462 --> 14:43.923
I DON'T THINK I WAS
HITTING ON YOU.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.346
YOU SAID YOU AND I WERE THE
BEST LOOKING PEOPLE IN THE BAR.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.929
AND HOW IS THAT
HITTING ON SOMEBODY?

14:49.930 --> 14:50.890
YOU GAVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.811
I GAVE YOU MY... ARE
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

14:52.812 --> 14:54.603
I DON'T REALLY... I DON'T
THINK I GAVE HER MY...

14:54.604 --> 14:56.185
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, OKAY?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.186
AND WE DON'T... OH, HONEY.
LOOK AT THAT.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.777
LITTLE CHEESEBURGERS. COME ON.

14:58.778 --> 15:00.189
I'LL TELL YOU,
THEY JUST MAKE 'EM

15:00.190 --> 15:01.781
LITTLER AND LITTLER
EVERY YEAR, DON'T THEY?

15:03.483 --> 15:05.524
( cellphone rings )

15:05.525 --> 15:08.197
THAT'S NOT YOUR PHONE?
IS THAT MY PHONE?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.619
- ( ringing )
- IT'S MY PHONE.

15:10.620 --> 15:11.790
WHO'S CALLING ME?

15:11.791 --> 15:13.203
( ringing continues )

15:15.795 --> 15:17.206
YOU GONNA GET THAT...

15:17.207 --> 15:18.708
DAMIEN?

15:23.543 --> 15:24.964
IT'S CALLED CATCH AND RELEASE, HONEY.
IT'S HARMLESS.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.545
WOULD YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN?
I WORK WITH THESE PEOPLE.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.547
I SWEAR, OKAY? NOTHING HAPPENED.

15:28.548 --> 15:31.100
I EXCHANGED PHONE NUMBERS WITH
SIX OTHER WOMEN THAT NIGHT, TOO.

15:31.101 --> 15:33.392
GREAT! OH, THAT MAKES
IT SO MUCH BETTER.

15:33.393 --> 15:35.434
HEY HEY HEY. YOU WANT
TO BE MAD AT SOMEBODY,

15:35.435 --> 15:36.855
BE MAD AT CHARLIE, ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS HIS FAULT.

15:36.856 --> 15:38.357
IT WAS ALL HIS IDEA.
HE MADE ME DO IT.

15:38.358 --> 15:39.688
OH, HE MADE YOU? IS
THIS THE SAME CHARLIE

15:39.689 --> 15:41.360
YOU SAID WAS SUCH A GREAT GUY?

15:41.361 --> 15:43.522
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STARTING TO COME
AROUND TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING ON THAT.

15:43.523 --> 15:45.365
I THINK CHARLIE MAY HAVE SOME
SERIOUS CHARACTER FLAWS.

15:46.366 --> 15:50.280
IS THAT YOUR PROFESSIONAL
OPINION AS A SECRET AGENT?

15:57.377 --> 15:59.208
HEY, LEN. WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

15:59.209 --> 16:01.960
UM, I JUST HAPPENED TO
BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

16:01.961 --> 16:03.382
AND SAW THAT "THE BIG LEBOWSKI"

16:03.383 --> 16:04.963
IS PLAYING AT THE $2 THEATER,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.545
AND SINCE IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE MOVIE,

16:06.546 --> 16:08.387
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
WANT TO GO SEE IT?

16:08.388 --> 16:10.889
OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST SAW IT LAST
NIGHT WITH CHRIS AND JORDAN.

16:10.890 --> 16:12.801
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY'VE
NEVER SEEN IT?

16:12.802 --> 16:15.514
I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO
TEACH THESE GIRLS.

16:15.515 --> 16:16.935
NO DOUBT.

16:16.936 --> 16:19.018
WELL, YOU KNOW, SINCE I'M HERE

16:19.019 --> 16:21.770
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
COINCIDENTALLY...

16:21.771 --> 16:23.942
DO YOU MAYBE WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE TONIGHT?

16:23.943 --> 16:25.364
OH, I WISH I COULD,

16:25.365 --> 16:26.445
BUT WE KIND OF
ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

16:26.446 --> 16:28.367
OH. WE WHO?

16:28.368 --> 16:30.699
OH, SOME PEOPLE FROM JORDAN'S
DANCE CLASS ARE COMING OVER.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.951
IT'S POLYNESIAN NIGHT.

16:32.952 --> 16:34.573
BUT HEY, YOU COULD PROBABLY
JOIN US FOR DINNER IF YOU WANT.

16:34.574 --> 16:35.954
OH, NAH.

16:35.955 --> 16:37.997
I HAD POLYNESIAN FOR LUNCH.

16:39.459 --> 16:40.789
HEY, Z.

16:40.790 --> 16:42.421
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING THE MUNG BEANS.

16:42.422 --> 16:43.962
I'M ON IT.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.124
THEY CALL ME Z.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.386
AND IT'S MY JOB TO
WATCH THE MUNG BEANS.

16:47.387 --> 16:50.389
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
WALKING AROUND IN THAT.

16:50.390 --> 16:52.551
THAT'S MY KIMONO.

16:52.552 --> 16:53.722
OH, RIGHT.

16:53.723 --> 16:55.135
( both chuckle )

16:56.596 --> 16:57.727
IT'S LIKE THIS ALL DAY.

16:59.399 --> 17:01.019
YEAH, WELL, UH...

17:01.020 --> 17:02.231
I SHOULD GO.

17:02.232 --> 17:04.693
WELL, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR
MIND, JUST TEXT ME.

17:04.694 --> 17:06.315
ALOHA.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.109
WHICH IN HAWAIIAN MEANS
HELLO AND GOODBYE.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.362
YEAH.

17:13.363 --> 17:14.534
ALOHA, Z.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.919
I TORE UP ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS
AS SOON AS I GOT HOME.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.461
YES, BUT YOU TOOK THEM.

17:22.462 --> 17:24.373
I WAS DOING MY JOB
AS THE WINGMAN.

17:24.374 --> 17:25.964
IT WAS MY DUTY! ALL
RIGHT, WHATEVER.

17:25.965 --> 17:27.376
MAYBE I TOOK IT A
LITTLE TOO FAR.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.548
I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT. I
WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.130
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:31.131 --> 17:32.971
I WANT YOU TO TELL
ME THE TRUTH, JOE.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.474
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.
CHARLIE MADE ME.

17:35.475 --> 17:37.346
OH, SO WHAT ARE YOU, A PUPPET?

17:37.347 --> 17:38.937
DID HE STICK HIS
HAND UP YOUR BUTT

17:38.938 --> 17:40.309
AND PARADE YOU AROUND THE BAR?

17:40.310 --> 17:43.442
I SAID I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

17:43.443 --> 17:45.184
SOME PART OF YOU MUST HAVE
WANTED TO DO WHAT YOU DID,

17:45.185 --> 17:46.315
OR YOU WOULD HAVE SAID NO.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.188
- SO YOU WANT TOTAL HONESTY?
- YES.

17:49.189 --> 17:51.190
I MEAN, OUR RELATIONSHIP
SHOULD BE A SAFE ZONE

17:51.191 --> 17:52.531
WHERE YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU FEEL.

17:52.532 --> 17:54.193
FINE.

17:54.194 --> 17:55.955
THE TRUTH IS...

17:57.367 --> 18:00.199
( sighs )

18:00.200 --> 18:01.790
YEAH.

18:01.791 --> 18:03.792
A LITTLE PART OF ME LIKED IT.

18:03.793 --> 18:07.206
YOU KNOW, IT WAS EXCITING
KNOWING THAT I STILL GOT IT.

18:07.207 --> 18:09.208
I MEAN, YOU'RE AT THE BAR,

18:09.209 --> 18:10.799
AND YOU'RE TALKING TO
SOME BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

18:10.800 --> 18:11.970
AND SHE'S LOOKING
AT YOU IN THE EYES

18:11.971 --> 18:13.132
AND YOU KNOW THAT SHE WANTS YOU.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.134
IT'S LIKE A RUSH.

18:16.556 --> 18:19.178
WOW.

18:19.179 --> 18:21.560
THAT IS SO AWESOME TO
BE HONEST LIKE THAT.

18:21.561 --> 18:23.142
THAT WAS AMAZING.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.773
HONEY, I GOTTA TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

18:24.774 --> 18:27.987
I HAVE NEVER FELT SO SAFE
IN A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.609
YOU PIG.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.322
I'M NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?!

18:33.323 --> 18:34.533
WHAT?! WAIT A MINUTE.

18:34.534 --> 18:36.325
YOU TOLD ME YOU WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH!

18:36.326 --> 18:37.576
YEAH, BUT NOT THAT TRUTH!

18:37.577 --> 18:39.117
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA SAY?!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.369
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.410
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D AT LEAST
PRETEND TO BE ASHAMED!

18:41.411 --> 18:43.202
I MEAN, THE WAY YOU SAID IT,

18:43.203 --> 18:45.123
YOU WERE JUST SO HAPPY.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.166
IT WAS ALL THEORETICAL.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.627
COME ON. YES, I COULD HAVE
OTHER WOMEN OUT THERE,

18:48.628 --> 18:51.129
- BUT I CHOSE YOU.
- OH, LUCKY LUCKY ME.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.711
WHAT... THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

18:52.712 --> 18:53.802
COME ON. I DON'T GET IT.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.214
YOU TOLD ME TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

18:55.215 --> 18:57.055
OKAY, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING HONEST

18:57.056 --> 18:58.757
AND BEING CRUEL. SOME
THINGS YOU JUST DON'T SAY.

18:58.758 --> 18:59.968
- ( sighs )
- LIKE YOU DON'T TELL SOMEONE

18:59.969 --> 19:01.180
THAT YOU FANTASIZE
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE

19:01.181 --> 19:02.262
WHILE YOU'RE MAKING
LOVE TO THEM.

19:06.766 --> 19:08.357
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU...

19:08.358 --> 19:10.979
YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE WHEN WE MAKE LOVE?

19:10.980 --> 19:13.692
NO, I SAID SOMEONE FANTASIZES
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE.

19:13.693 --> 19:15.364
YOU DO IT?

19:15.365 --> 19:17.536
NO! SOMETIMES.

19:17.537 --> 19:19.368
HERE AND THERE. LOOK, AS
LONG AS I DON'T ACT ON IT.

19:19.369 --> 19:21.990
IT'S OKAY TO THINK THINGS.
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE FANTASIES.

19:21.991 --> 19:23.622
FANTASIES. EXACTLY RIGHT.

19:23.623 --> 19:25.374
THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING.
I WAS FANTASIZING.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.376
ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOU
ROLE-PLAY UP HERE,

19:27.377 --> 19:29.087
I WAS ROLE-PLAYING AT A BAR.
IT'S THE SAME THING.

19:29.088 --> 19:30.839
NO NO NO. IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, JOE.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.211
YES, IT IS.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.382
YOU KNOW WHAT? ALL RIGHT FINE.
WHATEVER.

19:33.383 --> 19:34.633
- I'M 10% MORE GUILTY THAN YOU.
- 50.

19:34.634 --> 19:36.054
- 25.
- 30.

19:36.055 --> 19:37.557
FINAL OFFER.

19:39.299 --> 19:41.471
( chuckles )

19:43.353 --> 19:45.064
WHO DO YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT?

19:46.516 --> 19:47.516
- ( sighs )
- HMM?

19:47.517 --> 19:51.189
IS IT ANTONIO BANDERAS?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.361
IS IT?

19:52.362 --> 19:55.193
BECAUSE...

19:55.194 --> 19:57.777
( Spanish accent ) I CAN
BE ANTONIO BANDERAS.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.371
OH, YEAH?

20:02.372 --> 20:04.663
WELL, CAN YOU BE BRAD PITT?

20:04.664 --> 20:06.204
( chuckles )

20:06.205 --> 20:07.587
IF YOU CAN BE ANGELINA JOLIE.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.208
NOT A PROBLEM THERE.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.460
I'M HOT, I'M MYSTERIOUS,

20:11.461 --> 20:14.043
AND I'M RAISING KIDS THAT
DIDN'T COME OUT OF ME.

20:18.888 --> 20:20.469
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.800
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

20:21.801 --> 20:23.342
SHH. BRAD, DON'T TALK.

20:23.343 --> 20:25.475
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE HERE.

20:30.350 --> 20:31.810
( dance music playing )

20:31.811 --> 20:34.773
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL
NIGHT FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,

20:34.774 --> 20:37.356
AND YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, I
JUST WOULDN'T FORGIVE MYSELF

20:37.357 --> 20:38.778
IF I DIDN'T COME OVER.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.361
( French accent )
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

20:42.362 --> 20:44.533
I HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE BEFORE?

20:44.534 --> 20:46.204
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.206
MY IDENTITY IS HIGHLY SECRET.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.829
FOR THE SAFETY OF...

20:51.210 --> 20:52.582
THE PRESIDENT.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.294
CAN I BUY YOU ANOTHER DRINK?

20:55.295 --> 20:57.376
THAT DEPENDS.

20:57.377 --> 20:59.378
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

20:59.379 --> 21:00.799
( chuckles )

21:00.800 --> 21:02.220
NO.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.383
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU
DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

21:04.384 --> 21:06.765
BUT I THOUGHT...

21:06.766 --> 21:08.347
IS THIS A TRAP, MEL?

21:08.348 --> 21:10.349
WHO IS THIS MEL?

21:10.350 --> 21:13.312
AND IS SHE AS BEAUTIFUL AS ME?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.945
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO
GOOD WAY TO ANSWER THAT.

21:16.946 --> 21:20.359
AND WHEN THIS MEL ASKED YOU TO
GO TO THE DRYCLEANER YESTERDAY,

21:20.360 --> 21:23.572
DID THEY REALLY CLOSE EARLY?

21:23.573 --> 21:25.575
WHOSE FANTASY IS THIS?
