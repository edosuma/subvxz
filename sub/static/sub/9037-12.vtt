00:15.682 --> 00:18.050
- [sniffing]

00:23.356 --> 00:26.425
[groans]

00:26.427 --> 00:28.560
Sammy.

00:41.141 --> 00:45.544
Uh, not
the flannel pajamas.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.545
- What?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.347
- What the...

00:48.349 --> 00:49.815
When you come to bed
wearing that silky thing,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.650
I know I have a chance, but...

00:51.652 --> 00:53.519
Flannel pajamas...

00:53.521 --> 00:57.823
You might as well
be wearing a porcupine suit.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.658
- It's just,
I'm so tired, ray.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.694
- Yes, but we had
an appointment.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.297
Huh?
See the rocket ship?

01:08.535 --> 01:10.335
- I don't know;
it's just that, you know,

01:10.337 --> 01:12.371
I've been christmas
shopping all day,

01:12.373 --> 01:14.773
And then I just got
the twins down,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.475
And I'm just
not in the mood.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.844
- You don't have to
be in the mood.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.646
I mean, just start

01:20.648 --> 01:22.648
And you can get
in the mood.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.483
It--it's like
you're invited to a party

01:24.485 --> 01:26.185
That you don't want
to go to,

01:26.187 --> 01:29.088
So you figure, "I'm just gonna
stop by, say hello."

01:29.090 --> 01:31.423
And then you get there,
the next thing you know,

01:31.425 --> 01:35.727
You're swinging
at the piñata, wearing a hat.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.398
- I'm not going
to the party, ray.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.101
- You can't just not go.

01:45.672 --> 01:48.440
At least send a gift.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.675
- You know,
it's not always me.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.843
What about last week

01:50.845 --> 01:52.711
When I was in the mood
and you weren't?

01:52.713 --> 01:56.381
- When was that?

01:56.383 --> 01:57.382
- Wednesday.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.382
You were watching tv.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.651
I asked you to give me
a back rub.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.455
You gave me
one of these one-handed deals.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.690
- Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.593
You asked for a back rub,

02:07.595 --> 02:11.330
And that means
mr. Smith goes to washington?

02:14.567 --> 02:18.670
Come on.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.673
Why didn't you
say something?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.475
- Well, what am I supposed
to say,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.578
"hey, come on, you want some?
Let's do it."

02:27.881 --> 02:30.449
- I would love it
if you talked like that.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.657
- You know,
after all these years,

02:38.659 --> 02:42.294
You still have no idea,
do you?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.530
- Look, I know you
have to be in the mood,

02:44.532 --> 02:47.833
But can't you just
this once...

02:47.835 --> 02:50.802
Think like a man?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.504
- I am.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.208
I'm completely
disregarding your feelings.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.346
- You tell mr. Smith that.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.857
I don't know why it has to be
so hard, andy, you know?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.392
I mean, we're married
for eight years.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.494
It should get easier.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.529
It should be,
"you awake?" boom!

03:22.268 --> 03:23.936
- I'm the wrong guy
to talk to about women.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.872
Even my fantasies
just want to be friends.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.210
- Hi, guys.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.477
- Hey, erin.
- Hey.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.613
Hey, erin,
you're a woman.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.215
- Thanks.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.350
- Come here. Have a seat.
We got a question.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.651
We got to talk to you
about something.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.852
- Oh, don't, andy.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.754
- No, it's okay,
I'll talk to him.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.490
It's christmas.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.725
- Thank you, erin.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.462
Our question is this.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.965
Why can't I score?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.867
What--what--what
the hell's with you people?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.269
Why do women look at me

03:57.271 --> 03:59.938
Like I'm some kind
of homunculus?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.641
- This is
the big mystery?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.810
- No, ray has a question.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.545
Go ahead and ask her
what you were asking me.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.547
- I wasn't asking.
I was complaining.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.449
- Go ahead.
- No, I don't want to.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.751
- How come you don't like it
as much as we do?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.620
- [giggling]

04:14.622 --> 04:15.620
Who says we don't like it?

04:15.622 --> 04:19.391
What, we just--we prefer
to be in the mood first.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.759
- Okay, stop right there.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.261
The mood--

04:22.263 --> 04:25.397
Just give me directions
to the mood.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.398
- Exactly.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.003
And keep in mind that I live
further away than he does.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.473
- All right.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.841
You know, listen,
I can help you.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.744
Just--all you have to know
is that for a woman,

04:38.746 --> 04:41.446
It's all about intimacy.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.914
Holding hands,
kissing, talking.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.915
- Right. I know.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.983
I know all that, but look,

04:44.985 --> 04:46.518
When you're married
with three kids,

04:46.520 --> 04:47.853
You got no time
for that.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.755
You got shortcuts?

04:52.058 --> 04:53.692
- I thought marriage
was a shortcut.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.495
You've already
got her in the house...

04:56.497 --> 04:57.929
- No!
There are no shortcuts.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.564
Put in the time.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.932
A woman says,
"before I sleep with you,

05:00.934 --> 05:03.435
I want to feel close to you."

05:03.437 --> 05:05.637
- And I say, "you will feel
very close to me

05:05.639 --> 05:07.906
When you are
sleeping with me."

05:11.644 --> 05:13.412
- That's the problem
with you guys.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.414
You know what
you think?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.481
You think that
the mushy stuff

05:16.483 --> 05:17.481
Is over at the wedding.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.984
Well, we still want
the mushy stuff.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.652
Why can't you
try a little, huh?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.953
- What? I'm trying.
What do you want?

05:21.955 --> 05:23.689
- Some caring,
some consideration.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.325
Did you ever
try being creative?

05:26.327 --> 05:27.793
God, look at you!

05:27.795 --> 05:29.461
Tuck in your shirts.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.731
- Okay, thank you.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.366
Thanks for your help.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.567
- Hey, that's the way it is.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.568
You asked my advice
as a woman.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.569
I'm telling you.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.571
You got to try harder.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.639
- Hey.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.041
Hey, erin.
Erin...

05:43.043 --> 05:46.044
Come on.
Check it out, huh?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.446
- Very nice.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.548
We're still just friends.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.787
- [singing]
you better watch out

05:55.789 --> 05:57.889
You better watch out

05:57.891 --> 05:59.758
You better
watch out

05:59.760 --> 06:02.828
You better watch out

06:02.830 --> 06:06.398
You-ou-ou
better watch out

06:08.768 --> 06:10.435
- What is this?

06:10.437 --> 06:12.671
- That's just an early
christmas present

06:12.673 --> 06:14.639
For a good little girl.

06:14.641 --> 06:18.143
- Ohh.
That's sweet.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.379
What is it?

06:20.381 --> 06:21.713
- It's--it's magic hands.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.515
I--I thought
I'd get you this

06:23.517 --> 06:26.985
Now that I know what
"rub your back" means.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.021
- Isn't that considerate?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.424
Boy, ray, you are just
so transp--

06:32.426 --> 06:33.492
Ooh.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.760
Oh!

06:34.762 --> 06:35.994
Ooh.
- Yeah.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.796
- [giggles]
that's--that's not bad.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.664
- Yeah, it's good.
- Yeah.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.699
- I tried it.
- Wow.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.000
[giggling]

06:42.002 --> 06:44.035
Ooh.
That's good.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.538
Ooh, right there.
- Yeah?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.106
- Ohh!

06:48.108 --> 06:49.975
Ooh, yes.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.011
Oh, yes.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.980
Yes, raymond.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.584
- Raymond?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.653
You just
called me raymond.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.556
- Well, this is about
to be a special occasion.

07:04.558 --> 07:10.095
- Ha!

07:10.097 --> 07:11.430
- Ow! Ow!

07:11.432 --> 07:12.664
Ray, it's caught in my hair.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.799
- Easy.
Well, don't pull.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.200
What are you pulling?
- Don't pull it!

07:15.202 --> 07:16.935
- Stop moving.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.537
I can't get it out
if you're moving.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.639
- Turn that thing off!
- Stop moving!

07:20.641 --> 07:22.007
I'm still attached.
- Turn it off, ray.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.041
- Attached.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.644
Wait.
All right.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.879
- Ouch!

07:27.881 --> 07:29.848
Pulling on my hair!

07:32.018 --> 07:33.885
- Looks good on you, though.

07:37.890 --> 07:41.960
- [singing]
on a cold and gray

07:41.962 --> 07:43.228
Chicago morn

07:43.230 --> 07:46.631
And another
baby child is born

07:46.633 --> 07:50.469
In the ghetto

07:50.471 --> 07:53.939
[falsetto]
in the ghetto

07:53.941 --> 07:57.075
And his mama cries

07:57.077 --> 07:59.678
'cause if there's one thing
that she don't need

07:59.680 --> 08:01.913
It's another hungry
little mouth to feed

08:01.915 --> 08:04.749
In the ghetto

08:04.751 --> 08:07.919
[falsetto]
in the ghetto

08:07.921 --> 08:10.622
People, don't you
come and see--

08:10.624 --> 08:11.656
Hey.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.659
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.828
What?

08:16.830 --> 08:17.829
- Nothing.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.599
I just got
a little shiver.

08:20.601 --> 08:24.002
- Want me to--want me
to turn up the heat?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.838
- No.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.673
Not that kind of shiver.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.108
You gave me a shiver.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.743
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.111
You just
look kind of...

08:33.113 --> 08:35.547
Sexy.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.752
- What?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.522
- Yeah, well...

08:43.524 --> 08:44.990
You know,
with the sweeper and...

08:44.992 --> 08:46.691
- The sweeper?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.027
- Yeah.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.795
- That's what does it
for you?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.633
- No, but, you know, just--
I don't know,

08:54.635 --> 08:56.635
Watching you play
with the kids this morning

08:56.637 --> 08:58.270
And then, you know,
wearing these silly boxers

08:58.272 --> 09:00.572
That they gave you and...
Oh, I don't know,

09:00.574 --> 09:01.840
Just the fact
that you're my husband

09:01.842 --> 09:04.709
And you take care of us
and the whole picture.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.646
Sweeping just put it
over the top.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.125
- What are you
doing to me here!

09:20.127 --> 09:22.827
What?
You're killing me!

09:22.829 --> 09:24.729
- I just wanted to let you know
how I was feeling.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.931
- Well, you can't kiss me
like that.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.799
It's christmas.
Ally's up.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.934
My parents
are coming over now.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.302
- I'm sorry.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.204
- You've activated
the launch sequence now.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.675
What?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.114
[together]
merry christmas.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.651
- Hey.

09:46.653 --> 09:50.055
- Nice.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.958
We usually hang ours
on the door.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.868
- You made me wear
this dumb sweater.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.904
Ray's not even
wearing pants.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.675
- I guess
I'll go put clothes on.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.778
- Yeah, I'll go stir my eggs.
- Yeah.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.747
- No, no, no, no.
Keep that on.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.816
That's your
christmas sweater.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.351
- It's the sweater
or the pants, marie.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.620
Something's coming off.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.688
- Look at this.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.724
My k-9 kringle
police dog ornament

10:25.726 --> 10:28.126
Buried at the bottom
of the tree.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.029
That's typical.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.731
- No, no, no. Don't put it--
it doesn't look good.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.832
It looks terrible
up there.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.033
- Why?

10:35.035 --> 10:36.768
- Because of the two
wooden ornaments.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.170
You gotta have something shiny
in between.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.206
- Who gives a flying squirrel
about the ornaments?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.741
The lights are all wrong.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.676
- Oh, forget the lights.
Look at these garlands.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.877
You can't just
throw them on there.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
You've got to drape them.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.080
- I paid $15
for this ornament.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.281
They told me
how much they loved it.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.883
- You look out.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.852
- Okay, I'm putting k-9 kringle
right here.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.987
- No, no, no, no.
It's worse up there.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.856
- Marie, will you
get out of the way?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.158
- I'm not talking to you
and your stupid lights.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.894
Didn't that fire teach you
a lesson, you maniac?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.796
- Hey, do me a favor.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.930
Stick your toe
in the water,

11:05.932 --> 11:08.767
And twist this bulb
right here.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.435
- It'd be worth it
to get away from you.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.037
- Will you stop?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.772
You're killing christmas!

11:13.774 --> 11:16.941
- Oh, my god.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.077
What did you do?

11:19.079 --> 11:21.880
- Nothing.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.014
- Hi, grandma and grandpa.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.350
- Merry christmas, kids.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.357
- You just hate anything bigger
than you, don't you?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.064
Happy holidays.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.833
- Oh, ray, look at you.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.967
- What are you doing?

11:42.969 --> 11:45.136
- Your buttons are all off.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.273
- Oh, god.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.176
- Oh, you smell good.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.243
- I need you, raymond.

11:56.248 --> 11:57.348
We want to open our presents.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.151
Come on.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.421
- [sighs]

12:03.423 --> 12:05.023
- Here, dear.
From me to you.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.325
- Oh, thank you, marie.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.127
- And raymond,
I got you something.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.495
- Oh, I got you
something too.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.932
Hold on.
[groans]

12:13.934 --> 12:15.366
Whew.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.377
- Oh.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.012
It's a housecoat.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.481
- I noticed
you didn't have one.

12:29.483 --> 12:30.949
It's just like mine.

12:30.951 --> 12:35.420
- Oh, so we
could be twins.

12:35.422 --> 12:40.125
- Hold it up.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.459
- Wow, robert.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.361
- Yep, a remote-control
replica

12:43.363 --> 12:47.031
Of a vintage p-51 "d" mustang
flown by chuck yeager,

12:47.033 --> 12:50.101
Complete with a fully
operational slide-away canopy.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.302
[chuckles]

12:51.304 --> 12:54.973
Hey. Golf balls.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.541
- Yeah, well, I wanted to--

12:56.543 --> 12:58.143
- No, no, no.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.544
These are very good
golf balls.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.180
Yeah, and there's
three of them.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.015
- Hold them up.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.819
- You know what?

13:07.821 --> 13:10.121
Why don't you keep the plane
over at your house,

13:10.123 --> 13:11.790
'cause it'll probably
be safer there, yeah.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.790
- Are you sure?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.859
- Yeah, you can use it
whenever you want.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.261
- All right, great.
Thank you, raymond.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.196
And here,
keep these golf balls.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.964
And you can use them
whenever you want.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.502
- Oh, that's lovely.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.505
And it is so you.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.041
- What do you think, ray?

13:30.043 --> 13:33.878
- I just got a shiver.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.481
- Debra, the eggs florentine,

13:36.483 --> 13:39.250
Eggs-traordinary.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.485
- Oh, yes, dear.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.954
You're really coming along.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.255
- Thank you, marie.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.558
I'm just glad that
you could come along.

13:48.460 --> 13:51.429
- I'm stuffed.
Let's watch football.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.865
- Wait, dad, how about you and I
clear the table?

13:53.867 --> 13:54.933
- What?

13:54.935 --> 13:55.933
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.569
Let's give debra
the rest of the day off.

13:57.571 --> 13:58.937
- No, no, no.
Don't be ridiculous.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.171
Debra and I
can handle it.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.840
- No, no.
- Yeah, they can handle it.

14:01.842 --> 14:02.841
- Come on, come on.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.108
I think we should do it.
Come on.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.844
- Well, thank you...

14:05.846 --> 14:07.111
Raymond.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.953
- What in hell's manger
is wrong with you?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.422
- I just wanted to give
the ladies a break.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.624
You know, do something
for debra.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.259
- Why?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.961
- Hey, listen, you know
what I was thinking?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.195
Maybe you and mom

14:24.197 --> 14:26.531
Want to take the kids
this afternoon...

14:26.533 --> 14:30.235
To, uh...
To your house.

14:30.237 --> 14:34.372
- Why?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.208
- Again, the debra thing,
you know?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.977
And besides,
they're your grandchildren,

14:38.979 --> 14:40.945
And you love them,

14:40.947 --> 14:43.147
And you want to spend time
with them on christmas...

14:43.149 --> 14:45.950
Like people.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.552
- I'm spending time
with them here,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.355
And they're not
breaking my stuff.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.422
- I know, I know.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.291
It's just, uh...

14:53.293 --> 14:55.660
You know, it'll give debra
and me a chance to relax.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.562
- Relax?
Why do you want to relax?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.999
What do you mean?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.368
Oh.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.402
- What?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.104
- Relax.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.405
- What?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.974
- I read you
loud and clear.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.943
Time for a little nookie,
eh, sailor?

15:11.945 --> 15:14.646
- What? No.

15:14.648 --> 15:15.914
No, no.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.415
- On christmas day yet.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.684
Well, well, well,

15:19.686 --> 15:22.954
The nut does not fall
far from the tree.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.456
I remember one easter,
your mother and I--

15:25.458 --> 15:27.058
- Dad, please, please.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.126
Don't.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.227
- Don't worry about a thing,
son.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.395
I'm on the case.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.197
Marie!
- Dad, no.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.966
- Let's go, marie.
- Dad, wait.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.002
- Pack up your stuff
and grab the kids.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.170
- I didn't mean
for this.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.505
- Why?
Why are we leaving?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.473
- Ray and debra
want to relax.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.275
- Ray.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.944
- Dad, I didn't mean--
you don't have to do this.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.111
Come on.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.346
- Why?
Why do they have to relax?

15:48.348 --> 15:50.048
- They're young.
They're in love.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.116
You gotta be hit over the head
with a mallet?

15:52.118 --> 15:56.354
Figure it out.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.022
- Oh, my god!

15:58.024 --> 16:01.292
- Raymond,
it's christmas day.

16:03.028 --> 16:07.332
The baby jesus
was just born.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.433
- Okay, I found the batteries.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.435
We are clear for takeoff.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.104
- So's my boy.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.672
Everybody,
grab your coats.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.673
Chop chop.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.741
- What's going on?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.176
- Nothing.
Nothing's going on.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.177
No, you don't have to go.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.679
Come on.
You don't understand.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.082
- Oh, I understand it
all too well, raymond.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.450
In my day, there was
a little something

16:25.452 --> 16:27.251
Called self-control.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.721
- Not on easter 1962.
- Oh, shush.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.259
- Enjoy yourselves, kids.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.694
And flash the lights
when you're done.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.629
We'll come back over.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.387
- So...

17:02.389 --> 17:07.225
What do you want to do?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.360
- I think the moment
has passed, ray.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.362
- Okay, that moment has,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.231
But look,
here comes another.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.565
Hey!

17:17.803 --> 17:19.470
- You know, I--
I wish I was in the mood.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.205
I really do, but...

17:21.207 --> 17:23.808
You wouldn't want me
to fake it, would you?

17:28.313 --> 17:30.448
- I'm easy to fool.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.617
- You know, I just can't believe
you still want to

17:32.619 --> 17:35.753
After that atrocity
downstairs.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.356
- Look, I don't.
I don't.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.657
I thought I did.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.758
I wanted
to give it a try,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.594
But who am I kidding?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.268
- I'm sorry, ray.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.303
- Okay, I'm back.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.305
- [sighs]

18:00.479 --> 18:02.280
- What?

18:02.282 --> 18:03.714
Oh, what?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.450
- I--I just don't think
it's gonna happen.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.653
It's not you.
It's not you, ray.

18:08.655 --> 18:12.657
- Oh, it--it's them.
It's them! Ohh!

18:12.659 --> 18:14.292
Them! Them!

18:14.294 --> 18:15.793
Well, don't do that.
Don't let them ruin it.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.161
Right, come on.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.297
Look, I'll put on
the santa shorts

18:19.299 --> 18:20.865
And the sweeper.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.567
[singing]
in the ghetto

18:22.569 --> 18:24.135
In the ghetto

18:24.137 --> 18:25.136
Come on!

18:25.138 --> 18:26.637
Try.
Just try a little.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.373
- You yelling at me
isn't going to work.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.641
- Okay, all right.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.777
So there's something
that might work.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.812
All right,
I'm not yelling now.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.514
- Just maybe try
talking to me, okay?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.182
Talk to me!

18:38.184 --> 18:39.383
- What am I doing here?
I'm talking.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.651
- Well, no.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.186
Something nice,
something romantic.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.521
- Oh, uh, uh...

18:43.523 --> 18:45.890
You...

18:45.892 --> 18:47.458
I think you're
the most beautiful woman

18:47.460 --> 18:50.228
On the face
of the earth.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.228
And...

18:51.230 --> 18:54.499
I will know that
for as long as I live,

18:54.501 --> 18:59.604
Forever.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.606
- You're so pathetic.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.674
- Oh, that's it.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.643
- No, I mean that
in a good way.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.478
- I'm sick of jumping
through hoops, all right?

19:07.480 --> 19:12.383
I have my pride.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.886
- Get back here now,
raymond.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.493
- Raymond?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.530
- You heard me.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.232
- You just called me
pathetic.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.333
- Yes, but you're
never more sexy

19:29.335 --> 19:32.670
Than when
you're pathetic.

19:32.672 --> 19:37.875
- The mood has been hiding
right behind pathetic.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.779
That's--that is brilliant.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.414
I never would've thought
to look there.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.486
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.687
[buzzing]

19:49.689 --> 19:51.622
- What's that noise?

19:51.624 --> 19:52.690
- I don't care.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.326
[glass shattering]

20:03.902 --> 20:06.270
- [grunting]

20:09.675 --> 20:11.976
- I was thinking...

20:11.978 --> 20:13.644
Maybe we'll keep
the plane over here.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.816
Hey, deb.

20:21.253 --> 20:21.852
Thump!

20:25.857 --> 20:27.858
- Hey, what's up?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.794
- Give me change
of a dollar.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.696
- Hi, erin.
- How you doing?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.631
- How you doing?
- Good.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.399
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you later.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.005
- You were right, ray.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.541
Go pathetic.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.779
- Don't abuse it.
