...of my life.

07:31.667 --> 07:35.291
- Work...is such hard work.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.500
- I hate children.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.583
- We are very proud

07:39.041 --> 07:41.583
of how hard you worked today.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.583
- Now, for the best part...

07:43.625 --> 07:45.291
- Quads be gettin' paid!

07:45.333 --> 07:47.250
- Cash money!

07:47.291 --> 07:49.208
- Hello, Maxbox.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.125
- $10 each?

07:55.166 --> 07:56.583
Okay, that's it?

07:56.625 --> 07:59.375
- Good-bye, Maxbox.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.959
- Now you're starting

07:59.417 --> 08:01.959
to understand the value of...

08:02.000 --> 08:03.583
Cash money!

08:03.625 --> 08:05.750
- [chuckles]

08:05.792 --> 08:07.458
- Can you believe this?

08:07.500 --> 08:09.625
- Yeah, it's terrible.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.750
- Um, Dicky...

08:14.792 --> 08:17.750
Whatcha got there?

08:17.792 --> 08:20.291
- Parents gave me money

08:17.792 --> 08:20.291
when they picked up their

08:17.792 --> 08:20.291
kids.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.959
- Oh, that's great. We

08:20.333 --> 08:21.959
got tips!

08:22.000 --> 08:24.375
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.792
We didn't get tips.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.750
Dicky got tips.

08:28.792 --> 08:31.458
- For our work!

08:31.500 --> 08:35.250
- And we agreed to pool our

08:31.500 --> 08:35.250
money to buy a Maxbox

08:31.500 --> 08:35.250
together.

08:35.291 --> 08:38.500
- That's almost enough money

08:35.291 --> 08:38.500
to buy your own Maxbox.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.208
- Ooh.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.166
I was gonna buy

08:40.250 --> 08:43.166
some sweet foot rides.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.041
That's what Dicky

08:43.208 --> 08:45.041
calls shoes now.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.959
But...

08:47.000 --> 08:49.625
I do like the sound

08:47.000 --> 08:49.625
of my own Maxbox.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.166
All: What?

08:51.208 --> 08:53.166
- You can't buy your own

08:51.208 --> 08:53.166
Maxbox.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.792
- Why not?

08:54.834 --> 08:57.583
President George Jefferson

08:54.834 --> 08:57.583
says I can.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.625
- Grr!

09:03.792 --> 09:05.917
- I want to

09:03.792 --> 09:05.917
pa-rum-pa-pum-pummel him!

09:05.959 --> 09:07.750
- Okay, easy there,

09:05.959 --> 09:07.750
little drummer boy.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.458
- That's our money too!

09:09.500 --> 09:11.000
- Don't worry, guys.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.834
Look, tomorrow,

09:11.041 --> 09:12.834
all we have to do

09:12.875 --> 09:14.625
is trick Dicky

09:12.875 --> 09:14.625
out of his greeter job,

09:14.667 --> 09:17.417
and then we get all the tips.

09:19.583 --> 09:20.709
- Whew.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.333
Both: Nicky!

09:22.375 --> 09:23.875
- What, you've never seen

09:22.375 --> 09:23.875
an angry elf

09:23.917 --> 09:25.792
in his underwear before?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.667
Ooh, yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.667
All: Santa, come back!

09:34.709 --> 09:36.166
- Ho-ho-hold on, there, kids.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.000
Santa had a little too much milk

09:36.208 --> 09:39.000
with his cookies,

09:39.041 --> 09:42.458
and now he needs

09:39.041 --> 09:42.458
to go-go-go!

09:43.583 --> 09:44.834
I don't really need to go.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.625
Santa just needs

09:44.875 --> 09:46.625
a little "me" time.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.166
- I could use some "me" time.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.375
I haven't had a break in

09:48.208 --> 09:50.375
hours.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.583
- [chuckling]

09:52.625 --> 09:53.959
- What's so funny?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.750
- Nothing, it's just,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.750
you know...

09:55.792 --> 09:59.166
A break, from making cookies.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.834
You're just following a

09:59.208 --> 10:00.834
recipe,

09:59.208 --> 10:00.834
right?

10:00.875 --> 10:02.333
- Just following a recipe?

10:02.375 --> 10:03.625
Ha!

10:03.667 --> 10:05.083
Being Santa is a vacation

10:05.125 --> 10:07.333
compared to getting thousands

10:05.125 --> 10:07.333
of cookies out on time.

10:07.375 --> 10:11.333
- Oh, I think being Santa's

10:07.375 --> 10:11.333
a little harder than baking.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.291
Every kid is a new challenge.

10:13.333 --> 10:17.834
I've got to fill each of them

10:13.333 --> 10:17.834
with the Christmas spirit.

10:17.875 --> 10:21.834
There's no recipe for that,

10:17.875 --> 10:21.834
Anne.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.417
- You say, "ho-ho-ho,"

10:23.458 --> 10:25.083
and take credit for my cookies

10:25.125 --> 10:27.500
while sitting on that

10:25.125 --> 10:27.500
big, fat Santa butt.

10:27.542 --> 10:30.542
- Okay, let's leave

10:27.542 --> 10:30.542
my merry-maker out of this.

10:30.583 --> 10:31.959
But in the spirit

10:30.583 --> 10:31.959
of the season,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.333
I'm gonna give you

10:32.000 --> 10:33.333
a little gift.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.834
I'll bake your little cookies,

10:34.875 --> 10:37.709
and you can try being Santa.

10:37.750 --> 10:38.750
Here.

10:38.792 --> 10:39.834
- Deal.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.166
Now, hand over the beard.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.625
And you can keep the Santa-tude.

10:43.667 --> 10:47.250
- Ooh, Mrs. Claus has claws.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.792
Rawr.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.792
- Dolla-dolla bills, y'all.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.041
- Okay, time for operation...

10:59.083 --> 11:01.583
Tricky Dicky.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.000
Hey, can I talk to you

11:01.625 --> 11:03.000
for a sec?

11:03.041 --> 11:04.375
- Don't bother.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.125
You're not gonna trick me

11:04.417 --> 11:07.125
into leaving my post.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.750
- Oh, you're right.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.542
You know,

11:08.792 --> 11:10.542
you're too smart for that.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.792
Ooh, look, a really cute girl

over there.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.834
- Ooh, Dicky likey!

11:17.875 --> 11:20.333
- It's almost too easy.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.917
I'll take first shift.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.709
- Uh, no.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.959
I'll take first shift.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
- [laughs]

11:26.041 --> 11:26.834
No.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.125
I'm the one who tricked him.

11:28.166 --> 11:29.250
I'll take first shift.

11:29.291 --> 11:32.250
- There's a simple way

11:29.291 --> 11:32.250
to settle this.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.125
Whoever calls dibs.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.125
Dibs!
