Hmm?
Hmm.

00:48.350 --> 00:49.390
Hmm-mm.

00:50.590 --> 00:51.560
Oh, you know I like it when you
do that.

00:51.620 --> 00:52.460
I like it like that.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.630
Yeah, that feels good.

00:54.820 --> 00:55.770
Damn it Meatwad!

00:55.820 --> 00:57.000
What are you doing in here?

00:57.060 --> 00:59.040
I make...
I'm making a booty call.

00:59.090 --> 01:02.130
No, you're sleeping in my damn
bed at 2 in the morning,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.270
and you're hogging
all the covers.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.810
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute now.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.680
You said it was important to
share.

01:06.740 --> 01:07.980
Yeah, but we each have a bed.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.020
I ain't go no bed,
I got a damn grill in there.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.020
Because when we went
to the bed store

01:12.070 --> 01:14.110
and you saw a man grilling
hamburgers,

01:14.180 --> 01:15.810
you said,
"that's what I want to sleep on."

01:15.880 --> 01:16.910
So I bought it for you.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.190
What happened was,
we went to the bed store,

01:19.250 --> 01:21.230
and I saw a man outside grilling
hamburgers,

01:21.280 --> 01:25.600
and I said, "that's what I want
to sleep on", so you bought it for me.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.830
Look, you made your bed,
now you gotta lay in it, Meatwad.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.930
I ain't gonna lie in my bed
'cause it ain't a bed

01:31.990 --> 01:33.300
'cause it's a damn grill.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.000
I'll give you a treat if you
stay in there all night.

01:37.470 --> 01:39.140
How does a sticker sound?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.370
Sounds like it's gonna get stuck
way up your ass.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.880
I ain't gonna make it that long.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.680
It's a dang monster
in my closet.

01:47.110 --> 01:48.520
See, no monster, Meatwad.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.460
Well check the sand.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.000
- Nothing.
- Go check it again.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.690
Ok, there's still nothing there.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.600
- Check it again.
- I'm not gonna check it again.

02:00.660 --> 02:01.570
Th...There ain't nothing there.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.370
Hey, did you guys
hear like some scratching

02:04.430 --> 02:07.500
and howling like something
horrible

02:07.560 --> 02:10.910
was trying to rip its way through into
our realm?

02:10.970 --> 02:13.810
From the depths of a fiery,
fiery hell?

02:13.870 --> 02:15.780
I heard that very same noise too.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.040
Shake, don't make it worse.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.750
It's only gonna get worse,
if it gets out.

02:19.810 --> 02:21.450
It needs to feed, Frylock.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.350
Meatwad,
get down off the ceiling.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.820
Naw, not until someone checks
that sand.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.380
'Cause I think he's in the sand.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.220
There's nothing there Meatwad.
Nothing.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.270
Yeah, come on down I'm sure it's
nothing.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.530
But it could be this.

02:34.590 --> 02:35.620
Or this.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.800
Or even this.

02:37.860 --> 02:40.270
Possibly this.

02:40.330 --> 02:42.740
But probably this.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.200
That one's got haunting eyes
doesn't he?

02:45.270 --> 02:46.580
Will you get the hell out of here.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.980
You can't hide the truth.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.980
This room is crawling with evil!

02:51.040 --> 02:52.380
Evil I say!

02:52.440 --> 02:54.250
Meatwad listen to me
and listen close.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.760
There ain't no monsters living
in your closet.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.550
Monsters don't exist.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.420
And even if they did, you know I
would be able to kill them

03:01.480 --> 03:03.760
with my kung fu power-yaw!

03:04.890 --> 03:06.190
So, we're cool right?

03:06.250 --> 03:09.360
Yeah, we're cool as long as you get a
new comforter down in your room

03:09.420 --> 03:10.800
cause I greased all over that
last one.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.170
Fine, I'll take the rug.

03:15.430 --> 03:17.810
Damn my neck is stiff.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.570
Meatwad get up.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.980
Meatwad?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.140
Meatwad?!

03:22.770 --> 03:25.810
Yeah, he was devoured by razor
teeth in the night.

03:25.870 --> 03:26.980
Probably the monster.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.450
Ain't no monster, Shake!

03:28.510 --> 03:29.550
Coffee?

03:29.610 --> 03:30.720
Oh, thank you.

03:30.780 --> 03:32.260
- Hey!
- Wake-up genius!

03:32.310 --> 03:34.230
Your damn credit card's missing.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.690
It was the monster.

03:35.750 --> 03:36.860
Where is Meatwad?

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
Well yeah Kristen,

03:37.990 --> 03:40.060
please send me 4 more
of the shrimp cocktails.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.530
Also, I want to go head and get
that half day spa with

03:42.590 --> 03:45.200
the massage with the hot stones.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.830
And I'm having trouble with
the high speed internet access.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.430
Why don't you send one of the
techies up here to see if they

03:50.500 --> 03:51.710
can get that ironed out for me.

03:51.770 --> 03:54.440
'Cause my cow is running real
slow and uh...

03:54.500 --> 03:55.980
can't seem to access my piggy.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.180
$9,000 in the mini-bar?

04:00.410 --> 04:01.550
You're calling my home number,

04:01.610 --> 04:04.850
does it sound like I stayed
there last night?

04:04.910 --> 04:06.860
No I didn't authorize that.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.290
Thanks for the ride Manaka.

04:08.350 --> 04:10.630
Just keep it running, I may need
to run to the mall later

04:10.690 --> 04:13.500
and get me one of them braided
belts with the big buckle.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.260
Don't worry about it,
we'll throw it all on the card.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.360
And what card is that?

04:16.430 --> 04:18.060
It's call a credit card.

04:18.130 --> 04:19.570
You just give this to a person

04:19.630 --> 04:20.730
and you get things.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.940
You stayed at a hotel last night.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.100
I did?
Awesome.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.270
The honeymoon suite?

04:25.330 --> 04:28.010
Oh, it's got a beautiful view of
downtown and the pier.

04:28.070 --> 04:29.140
Why wouldn't I stay there?

04:29.200 --> 04:30.710
No, I cancelled the card.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.010
You're living here from now on,
okay?

04:32.070 --> 04:34.880
But Dewey and Vanessa,
I checked them with the concierge.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.450
Well I guess they gonna have to
get a ride back here

04:36.510 --> 04:37.820
with the limo driver then aren't they.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.380
Alright, let me get Manaka on
the horn.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.520
No, no horn.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.060
You 'bout to start raking yards
for the rest of your life mister.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.760
You know and I know that I got a
monster in that closet

04:46.820 --> 04:49.170
hiding in the sand,
waiting till night time,

04:49.220 --> 04:50.860
so he can eat and kill me.

04:50.930 --> 04:53.960
Yes, I captured thermal images of
his whereabouts last night.

04:54.030 --> 04:54.910
Don't listen to him.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.960
Yeah, don't listen to me.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.770
Don't even listen to this
recording I made.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.010

La cucaracha ♪

05:01.070 --> 05:01.910

translation.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.220

05:12.980 --> 05:14.960
ls the meat man.

05:15.020 --> 05:15.860
Oh no!

05:15.920 --> 05:17.950
Frylock,
you're not made of meat.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.190
I'm not made of meat.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.260
I am!

05:20.320 --> 05:21.600
I'm made of meat!

05:22.290 --> 05:23.330
Well there you go.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.230
Meatwad listen.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.670
We're gonna find this monster.

05:25.730 --> 05:26.640
And we're gonna destroy it.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.040
And then the problem'll be
solved, right?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.470
Well, only I can track him.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.140
But that requires you meeting my
enormous fee.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.940
I've studied the monster for
years.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.420
I know his patterns and I know
his weaknesses.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.470
And as you know...

05:38.540 --> 05:41.040
my major was in model
management.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.140
And theatre.

05:42.210 --> 05:45.090
But my minor was in
monsterology.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.490
He's got a point.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.090
We'd be foolish not to hire him.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.560
We'd be dicks to hire him.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.930
Roar, yeah roar.

05:53.990 --> 05:57.800
Take off them granny panties and
set aside them crutches,

05:57.860 --> 05:59.240
'cause the monster's coming to
get ya.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.330
I gotcha!

06:01.500 --> 06:02.530
Hey Carl.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.230
Hey Fryman.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.750
What you uh...
What are you doing here?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.180
Well, what are you
doing over there?

06:09.240 --> 06:11.080
No, no, no, no, no,
what are you doing in here?

06:11.140 --> 06:12.240
In my private house?

06:12.310 --> 06:14.220
Well- I- I knocked Carl.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.520
No one answered.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.650
That is...
That is correct.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.190
And for a very good reason.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.890
So, what are you doing?

06:21.950 --> 06:23.590
I am checking sports scores.

06:25.190 --> 06:26.600
And you've always got an
erection?

06:26.660 --> 06:28.570
When you check your sports
scores?

06:28.620 --> 06:30.160
That's got to be embarrassing,
man.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.540
Naw,
I've discovered through the internet,

06:32.590 --> 06:35.400
you do anything you want as long
as no one sees your face.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.340
It's like the wild west over here.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.780
My larger point is,

06:38.830 --> 06:41.640
if you don't like my balls hanging out,
you look away.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.880
Well I kinda need your help,

06:43.940 --> 06:45.380
but you're probably busy...

06:45.440 --> 06:46.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'll help ya.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.250
I am a neighbor.

06:48.310 --> 06:49.620
How much money you'll give me?

06:49.680 --> 06:51.160
I don't have a lot of money
Carl,

06:51.210 --> 06:53.890
but what if we had a pizza
party, huh?

06:53.950 --> 06:55.590
Ah, I've been down this road
before.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.900
You got the coupon for
the garlic bread sticks

06:58.950 --> 07:00.370
with the onion dip and sauce?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.630
Yeah, whatever,
sure we can do that.

07:01.690 --> 07:03.100
Alright!
Let me get changed.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.540
No, no, no
that's actually perfect.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.400
God, are you freaking into this too?

07:06.930 --> 07:09.470
This special ghost light will
pick up the apparition residue

07:09.530 --> 07:10.370
so we can track it.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.970
That's funny,
it looks like a black light,

07:12.030 --> 07:13.440
from that White Lion poster.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.040
That you was too embarrassed to
hang up.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.210
Well it's not.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.770
Look, apparition residue,
he was here.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.340
Apparition... residue?

07:21.410 --> 07:24.480
My company finds actual monster
foot prints.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.950
And we carbon date them

07:26.010 --> 07:29.390
to the exact moment that the beast
enters the house.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.360
Well hell yeah, we do that too.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.490
Pictures of the monster, did he
even offer you a photo package?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.400
I don't think so.

07:34.460 --> 07:38.430
We have glossy 8X10's, 11X14's,
wallets, calendars, framed,

07:38.490 --> 07:40.100
unframed, matted,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.270
we're here to work
within your budget.

07:42.330 --> 07:43.600
You can't even find the monster.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.140
Shake's offering me dang photos.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.080
No, no, no, not just photos,

07:47.140 --> 07:51.520
I capture him in a decorative vial so
the monster can be displayed.

07:51.570 --> 07:52.710
How do you plan to do that?

07:52.770 --> 07:57.280
L-I... with this monster bottle.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:06.920 --> 08:09.560
- Ah.
- Which will trap him in plastic,

08:09.620 --> 08:12.130
and for you

08:12.190 --> 08:14.370
I'll throw it in for four
payments of $89.99.

08:15.230 --> 08:16.300
What's the point of the chair?

08:16.360 --> 08:17.900
Chair...trap.

08:17.970 --> 08:18.940
Monster sees it,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.450
"hey, I'm gonna take a break
from being scary,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.510
that looks good, I'm gonna sit
down, relax..."

08:23.570 --> 08:25.850
Boom!
"Oh no, I got trapped!"

08:26.340 --> 08:29.880
Diamond cyber shackles,
capture him, for our client.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.650
Meatwad, it's the same chair you've
been looking at for the past 10 years.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.850
But this time look,
it got change in there.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.799
No, no, no, no, please back away
from the mechanism.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.559
Ahh, just a nickel.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.070
Frylock, he got a cyber diamond
chair trap

08:42.120 --> 08:43.630
with a nickel mechanism.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.300
You just got some
dumb-ass purple light.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.770
How 'bout a sticker of a mighty
unicorn.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.430
I don't know man.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.340
I just don't know.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.210
Look, I can tell you're uneasy.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.010
Why don't you take a moment to
think about it.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.280
Take all the time you want.

08:57.140 --> 09:01.450
But just know that my offer is
expiring in point 1 seconds.

09:01.510 --> 09:02.490
What is your decision?

09:02.540 --> 09:03.680
Uh, when do I come out?

09:03.750 --> 09:05.090
I'm sweating my balls off here.

09:05.150 --> 09:05.990
The monster!

09:11.790 --> 09:15.430
Well, I'm glad we were able to wrap
that up for you, sir.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.230
We had discussed a credit plan.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.270
Yeah I know but,
Frylock killed him.

09:20.330 --> 09:21.900
Now that's a standard illusion.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.240
The monster altered your mind to
think he was killed.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.440
But in fact he's right behind you!

09:27.500 --> 09:29.240
- No!
- He just left.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.750
He is quick.

09:30.810 --> 09:32.150
No, he's dead Shake.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.350
We all saw it.

09:33.410 --> 09:36.050
Meatwad, help me drag
the monster over to Carl's house.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.850
Oh look, he's got a handle.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.410
No, don't touch that.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.750
Oh no!

09:42.120 --> 09:43.600
The monster's ghost!

09:43.650 --> 09:45.260
Everyone stop, just listen.

09:46.790 --> 09:47.630
Do you hear that?

09:47.690 --> 09:50.690
It's the monster's ghost,
just like you said.

09:51.530 --> 09:52.700
He's a bit quiet though.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.760
Yeah, that's 'cause he's shy,

09:53.830 --> 09:55.570
he's not good in social
situations.

09:55.630 --> 09:58.740
He feels awkward, but one on one,
he'll open up to you.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.370
Ask him what he wants.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.280
But don't ask him in front of
everyone,

10:02.340 --> 10:03.820
I don't want to make it awkward
for him.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.180
What's that?
You're gonna eat his soul?

10:06.240 --> 10:07.850
Ah, don't do that.
Come on he's a nice...

10:07.910 --> 10:09.120
Shake, enough of that crap!

10:09.180 --> 10:11.380
Actually I do hear that.

10:11.450 --> 10:12.750
Oh god, what is that noise?

10:12.810 --> 10:13.660
It's a monster.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
Shh-shh-shh!

10:14.780 --> 10:17.130
- Finally I've been validated here.
- Shh!

10:24.590 --> 10:27.660
Aww, look it's
just your gerbil Starsky.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.270
Hey Starsky.

10:29.330 --> 10:31.400
Yeah, you want something to eat?

10:31.570 --> 10:34.340
Give me a celery stick you scale.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.050
The power of Christ compels you.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.950
The power of Christ compels you!

10:39.010 --> 10:41.180
Your mother sucks cocks in hell.

10:42.140 --> 10:45.090
Come into him damn you,
come into him!

10:45.150 --> 10:46.750
Come into who now?

10:51.020 --> 10:52.730
Damn it,
we're on the ground floor.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.800
I've never spent
a weekend in the city,

10:55.860 --> 10:57.430
this is so exciting for me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.670
Look, they have fountains.

11:00.630 --> 11:03.170
Ahhhh!

11:05.470 --> 11:07.780
Finally, we going home now?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.040
Uh-huh, we're
sleeping here in your bed man.

11:11.810 --> 11:13.310
- Room service!
- Ahhh!
