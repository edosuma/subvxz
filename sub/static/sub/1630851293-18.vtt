>> John: HI THERE, WELCOME TO

00:36.866 --> 00:38.400
THE SHOW, WE'RE BACK, STILL FROM

00:38.466 --> 00:40.566
THIS BLANK VOID.

00:40.633 --> 00:41.266
ON THAT POINT, I HAVE A BIT OF

00:41.333 --> 00:43.266
AN UPDATE.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.766
LOOKS LIKE, ALL BEING WELL, WE

00:44.833 --> 00:46.233
ARE SET TO BE BACK IN OUR STUDIO

00:46.300 --> 00:48.033
IN SEPTEMBER, MEANING THAT THE

00:48.100 --> 00:49.366
NEXT FIVE SHOWS ARE ACTUALLY

00:49.433 --> 00:50.300
GOING TO BE THE LAST THAT WE DO

00:50.366 --> 00:53.066
THERE IN THE VOID.

00:53.133 --> 00:54.600
>> HOLY SHIT, THANK GOD.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.200
>> John: EXCUSE ME?

00:56.266 --> 00:58.033
>> YOU HEARD ME.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.366
>> I'M SORRY, YOU CAN TALK?

00:59.433 --> 01:01.866
>> OF COURSE I CAN TALK, JOHN.

01:01.933 --> 01:03.300
I CAN ALSO CRY, WHICH, YOU KNOW,

01:03.366 --> 01:09.166
I'M NOT AFRAID TO CRY.

01:09.233 --> 01:09.933
I CAN SING PRETTY WELL,

01:10.000 --> 01:10.566
ACTUALLY.

01:10.633 --> 01:11.133
>> John: NICE.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.066
>> ALSO, I CAN LAUGH.

01:12.133 --> 01:12.766
VOID LOVES TO LAUGH.

01:12.833 --> 01:13.700
>> John: I'M SORRY, YOU CAN

01:13.766 --> 01:14.033
LAUGH?

01:14.100 --> 01:15.466
REALLY?

01:15.533 --> 01:16.066
I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE

01:16.133 --> 01:16.966
FOR NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF

01:17.033 --> 01:17.533
TELLING JOKES AND I HAVEN'T

01:17.600 --> 01:18.233
HEARD YOU LAUGH ONCE.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.066
NOT ONE TIME.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.066
>> WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU

01:21.133 --> 01:22.100
HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN ME A REASON

01:22.166 --> 01:24.266
TO, AND I DIDN'T CONSIDER ANY OF

01:24.333 --> 01:25.133
THOSE JOKES.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
>> John: THAT IS A MEAN THING TO

01:26.266 --> 01:27.200
SAY.

01:27.266 --> 01:28.000
>> I'M GOING TO GET THIS OFF MY

01:28.066 --> 01:29.366
CHEST.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.666
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

01:31.733 --> 01:32.600
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:32.666 --> 01:33.533
>> John: WHAT?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.966
>> IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD

01:37.033 --> 01:37.900
TO BE JUST A VOID AGAIN WITHOUT

01:37.966 --> 01:39.566
YOU IN IT, WHICH IS A PRETTY

01:39.633 --> 01:40.500
SHOCKING DECLARATION WHEN YOU

01:40.566 --> 01:41.533
SAY THAT A VOID WOULD RATHER BE

01:41.600 --> 01:43.966
JUST A VOID WITH NOTHING IN IT

01:44.033 --> 01:46.833
BECAUSE OF YOU.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.166
>> John: LOOK, CAN I JUST START

01:48.233 --> 01:48.800
MY SHOW NOW PLEASE?

01:48.866 --> 01:49.366
>> GO AHEAD, I MEAN, IF YOU

01:49.433 --> 01:50.300
WANT.

01:50.366 --> 01:51.533
OR DON'T.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.400
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME

01:54.466 --> 01:55.433
EITHER WAY.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.033
HAS IT BEEN A BUSY WEEK, JOHN?

01:56.100 --> 01:56.900
>> John: YES, IT HAS.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.033
IT HAS, ACTUALLY.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.933
>> [GROANS]

02:00.000 --> 02:02.633
SO AGGRAVATING.

02:02.700 --> 02:03.700
>> John: ALL RIGHT.

02:03.766 --> 02:04.433
>> JUST PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.666
>> John: I WILL.

02:08.733 --> 02:11.066
>> I WILL REMAIN SILENT.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.100
BECAUSE I WON'T BE LAUGHING.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.333
>> John: THAT IS UNDERSTOOD.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.466
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

02:15.533 --> 02:16.033
VERY BUSY.

02:16.100 --> 02:16.766
I'M READY, THE OLYMPICS OPENING

02:16.833 --> 02:17.766
CEREMONY FINALLY TOOK PLACE IN

02:17.833 --> 02:18.700
TOKYO.

02:18.766 --> 02:20.200
A YEAR LATE AND STILL UNDER

02:20.266 --> 02:20.600
SIGNIFICANT CLOUD.

02:20.666 --> 02:21.200
>> THIS MORNING, OFFICIALS IN

02:21.266 --> 02:21.966
TOKYO REVEALING THAT COVID CASES

02:22.033 --> 02:23.166
HAVE INCREASED 155% IN THE PAST

02:23.233 --> 02:25.100
SEVEN DAYS.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.700
>> TONIGHT, COVID-19 DEFEATING

02:26.766 --> 02:27.900
SOME OLYMPIC ATHLETES BEFORE

02:27.966 --> 02:29.200
THEY'VE EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO

02:29.266 --> 02:30.700
COMPETE.

02:30.766 --> 02:31.933
ACCORDING TO THE IOC, MORE THAN

02:32.000 --> 02:33.100
60 PEOPLE IN THE OLYMPIC BUBBLE

02:33.166 --> 02:34.333
HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE

02:34.400 --> 02:36.733
VIRUS.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.100
>> John: AND THE TRUTH IS, IT'S

02:38.166 --> 02:40.166
GOTTEN EVEN WORSE, BECAUSE AS OF

02:40.233 --> 02:41.833
SATURDAY THE CURRENT TOTAL OF

02:41.900 --> 02:44.166
OLYMPICS-RELATED COVID CASES IS

02:44.233 --> 02:46.566
UP TO 127.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.700
WHICH REALLY SHOULDN'T BE

02:47.766 --> 02:48.566
SURPRISING.

02:48.633 --> 02:49.666
THE EVENT WHOSE CENTRAL PREMISE

02:49.733 --> 02:50.933
IS BASICALLY, "WHAT IF A BUNCH

02:51.000 --> 02:52.433
OF HOT PEOPLE TRAVELED FROM ALL

02:52.500 --> 02:53.166
OVER THE WORLD TO SWEAT,

02:53.233 --> 02:53.900
BREATHE, AND FUCK ON EACH OTHER"

02:53.966 --> 02:55.233
TURNS OUT TO BE GOING EXACTLY AS

02:55.300 --> 02:56.033
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO DURING A

02:56.100 --> 02:58.300
PANDEMIC.

02:58.366 --> 02:59.566
AND I WILL SAY, TOKYO IS BY NO

02:59.633 --> 03:01.300
MEANS ALONE IN MAKING A VERY

03:01.366 --> 03:02.633
BOLD MOVE IN THE FACE OF THE

03:02.700 --> 03:05.266
SPREAD OF THE DELTA VARIANT.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.533
IN THE U.K., MONDAY MARKED

03:06.600 --> 03:07.466
SO-CALLED FREEDOM DAY, WITH THE

03:07.533 --> 03:08.933
LIFTING OF ALMOST ALL

03:09.000 --> 03:10.566
VIRUS-RELATED RESTRICTIONS, EVEN

03:10.633 --> 03:11.800
THOUGH COVID CASES HAVE RECENTLY

03:11.866 --> 03:13.166
SPIKED TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS

03:13.233 --> 03:15.266
THERE SINCE JANUARY.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.000
BORIS JOHNSON HAS FACED

03:17.066 --> 03:18.466
SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM ABOUT THIS

03:18.533 --> 03:19.666
DECISION AND HAS CHOSEN TO

03:19.733 --> 03:21.700
JUSTIFY IT LIKE THIS:

03:21.766 --> 03:22.800
>> IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW, WE'VE

03:22.866 --> 03:23.800
GOT TO ASK OURSELVES, WHEN WILL

03:23.866 --> 03:25.666
WE EVER DO IT?

03:25.733 --> 03:26.833
>> John: OH, I CAN ANSWER THAT

03:26.900 --> 03:27.966
FOR YOU: LATER.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.133
JUST, A LATER TIME.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.400
IT'S SO BRAZENLY DISINGENUOUS TO

03:31.466 --> 03:33.300
FRAME THIS AS A CHOICE BETWEEN

03:33.366 --> 03:34.933
LIFTING COVID RESTRICTIONS NOW

03:35.000 --> 03:37.233
OR NEVER DOING IT.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.766
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SOMEONE

03:38.833 --> 03:39.700
SAYING, "IF I DON'T TAKE A SHIT

03:39.766 --> 03:40.466
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS APPLE

03:40.533 --> 03:41.500
STORE, WHEN WILL I EVER TAKE A

03:41.566 --> 03:42.666
SHIT?"

03:42.733 --> 03:45.133
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY, BUT I FEEL

03:45.200 --> 03:45.733
LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

03:45.800 --> 03:46.900
OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAT YOU'RE

03:46.966 --> 03:48.400
CHOOSING NOT TO CONSIDER.

03:48.466 --> 03:51.833
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING, "WHY

03:51.900 --> 03:53.200
DOES BORIS JOHNSON LOOK LIKE

03:53.266 --> 03:54.600
HE'S HIRED AN IMPERSONATOR OF

03:54.666 --> 03:56.033
HIMSELF TO DELIVER THIS MESSAGE

03:56.100 --> 03:56.733
VIA CAMEO?"

03:56.800 --> 03:57.433
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS

03:57.500 --> 03:58.233
SELF-ISOLATING AFTER BEING

03:58.300 --> 03:58.833
EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO CAUGHT

03:58.900 --> 04:00.033
COVID.

04:00.100 --> 04:00.966
SPECIFICALLY, HIS HEALTH

04:01.033 --> 04:03.333
MINISTER.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.566
WHICH IS NOT AN IDEAL WAY TO

04:04.633 --> 04:05.200
REASSURE PEOPLE THAT "NOW IS THE

04:05.266 --> 04:06.666
RIGHT TIME TO OPEN UP."

04:06.733 --> 04:08.166
AND EVEN SOME OF THE BRITISH

04:08.233 --> 04:10.466
PEOPLE CELEBRATING "FREEDOM DAY"

04:10.533 --> 04:11.433
SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THEY WERE

04:11.500 --> 04:13.000
DANCING ON A KNIFE'S EDGE.

04:13.066 --> 04:13.933
>> I WANT TO DANCE, I WANT TO

04:14.000 --> 04:15.266
HEAR LIVE MUSIC.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.600
>> YES!

04:16.666 --> 04:17.633
IT FEELS LIKE FREEDOM DAY, IT

04:17.700 --> 04:19.100
REALLY, REALLY DOES.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.433
>> IT'S NICE TO BE OUT, BUT LIKE

04:20.500 --> 04:21.400
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S ALL

04:21.466 --> 04:24.500
GOING TO RESULT IN SOME SORT OF

04:24.566 --> 04:26.166
IMPENDING DOOM.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.100
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:30.166 --> 04:30.833
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH CVS-BRAND

04:30.900 --> 04:31.533
NOEL GALLAGHER THERE.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.366
BECAUSE THAT SENTIMENT

04:32.433 --> 04:33.066
FUNDAMENTALLY SPEAKS TO THE

04:33.133 --> 04:34.100
BRITISH CHARACTER.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.566
SCREW "KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON."

04:35.633 --> 04:37.033
"IT'S ALL GOING TO RESULT IN

04:37.100 --> 04:38.333
SOME SORT OF IMPENDING DOOM"

04:38.400 --> 04:39.633
SHOULD BE BRITAIN'S NEW

04:39.700 --> 04:42.933
MOTIVATIONAL POSTER, BECAUSE

04:43.000 --> 04:43.666
THAT IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT

04:43.733 --> 04:52.166
EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.700
EVEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES,

04:53.766 --> 04:54.433
THERE IS CAUSE FOR REAL CONCERN

04:54.500 --> 04:54.966
AMID ALL THE OPTIMISM.

04:55.033 --> 04:55.600
THE DELTA VARIANT NOW ACCOUNTS

04:55.666 --> 04:56.666
FOR 83% OF KNOWN U.S. CASES AND

04:56.733 --> 04:57.266
IS CAUSING A RISE IN HOSPITAL

04:57.333 --> 04:57.866
ADMISSIONS, PARTICULARLY AMONG

04:57.933 --> 04:58.366
THE UNVACCINATED.

04:58.433 --> 04:59.766
AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THAT

04:59.833 --> 05:01.300
VACCINES ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE

05:01.366 --> 05:02.800
HERE, SOME -- EVEN THOSE

05:02.866 --> 05:03.600
HOSPITALIZED -- ARE STILL

05:03.666 --> 05:05.800
HESITANT.

05:05.866 --> 05:07.133
>> HERE I AM, RECOVERING,

05:07.200 --> 05:08.066
GETTING OUT OF HERE FINALLY

05:08.133 --> 05:09.700
TOMORROW.

05:09.766 --> 05:10.866
AM I GOING TO GET A VACCINE?

05:10.933 --> 05:13.466
NO.

05:13.533 --> 05:16.533
DON'T SHOVE IT DOWN MY THROAT.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.000
THAT'S WHAT'S LOCAL, STATE,

05:19.066 --> 05:20.666
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING

05:20.733 --> 05:21.466
TO DO, IS SHOVE IT DOWN YOUR

05:21.533 --> 05:22.333
THROAT.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.300
>> WHAT ARE THEY SHOVING, THE

05:23.366 --> 05:24.466
SCIENCE?

05:24.533 --> 05:25.300
>> NO, THEY'RE SHOVING THE FACT

05:25.366 --> 05:26.300
THAT THAT'S THEIR AGENDA.

05:26.366 --> 05:29.000
THE AGENDA IS TO GET YOU

05:29.066 --> 05:29.300
VACCINATED.

05:29.366 --> 05:30.333
>> John: UH...

05:30.400 --> 05:35.433
YEAH.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.100
YEAH, ACTURALY, NAILED IT IN

05:36.166 --> 05:36.666
ONE.

05:36.733 --> 05:37.366
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS' AGENDA

05:37.433 --> 05:38.433
IS TO GET YOU VACCINATED.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.100
AND YOU KNOW WHAT COVID'S AGENDA

05:39.166 --> 05:40.733
IS?

05:40.800 --> 05:41.300
TO FUCKING KILL YOU.

05:41.366 --> 05:42.100
TO BURROW INTO YOUR BODY THROUGH

05:42.166 --> 05:42.733
YOUR HOT LITTLE MOUTH, FUCK

05:42.800 --> 05:43.433
AROUND WITH YOUR LUNGS, FLIP

05:43.500 --> 05:44.866
YOUR NOSTRILS OFF, MAKE SOUP

05:44.933 --> 05:46.066
TASTE MORE LIKE NOTHING THAN IT

05:46.133 --> 05:50.100
ALREADY DOES, AND THEN KILL YOU.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.866
SO FRANKLY, IF THE CHOICE IS

05:51.933 --> 06:01.300
BETWEEN AGENDA: DEATH OR

06:01.366 --> 06:03.566
AGENDA: SHOT THAT COMES WITH

06:03.633 --> 06:06.000
FREE KRISPY KREME DONUT, I THINK

06:06.066 --> 06:06.566
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE

06:06.633 --> 06:07.233
JIZZ-COVERED DOUGH HOOP

06:07.300 --> 06:08.200
WITH A SIDE OF ANTIBODIES.

06:08.266 --> 06:09.233
AND WHILE THAT'S CLEARLY

06:09.300 --> 06:09.833
INFURIATING, INDIVIDUALS LIKE

06:09.900 --> 06:10.433
THAT MAN ARE PRETTY MUCH

06:10.500 --> 06:11.133
UNREACHABLE AT THIS POINT, WHICH

06:11.200 --> 06:11.933
IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO

06:12.000 --> 06:12.866
CONVINCE EVERYONE WHO MIGHT BE

06:12.933 --> 06:14.800
PERSUADABLE TO GET VACCINATED.

06:14.866 --> 06:15.666
BECAUSE IF THIS WEEK'S TAUGHT US

06:15.733 --> 06:17.033
ANYTHING, IT'S THAT COVID IS

06:17.100 --> 06:18.766
NOWHERE NEAR BEING ERADICATED

06:18.833 --> 06:21.000
AND THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST IT

06:21.066 --> 06:22.900
IS BEING FUCKING VACCINATED.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.033
YES, THERE ARE BREAKTHROUGH

06:24.100 --> 06:24.966
CASES, BUT THE VACCINE IS DOING

06:25.033 --> 06:27.100
ITS JOB.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.500
MORE THAN 97% OF THOSE

06:28.566 --> 06:29.833
HOSPITALIZED FOR COVID IN THE

06:29.900 --> 06:32.700
U.S. ARE UNVACCINATED.

06:32.766 --> 06:34.233
SO RIGHT HERE WE NEED TO BE

06:34.300 --> 06:36.000
ENCOURAGING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE

06:36.066 --> 06:39.400
TO GET THEIR SHOTS, AND,

06:39.466 --> 06:41.000
CRUCIALLY, TO THEN SHARE OUR

06:41.066 --> 06:42.400
SURPLUS SUPPLY WITH COUNTRIES

06:42.466 --> 06:43.866
AROUND THE WORLD THAT

06:43.933 --> 06:44.933
DESPERATELY NEED THEM.

06:45.000 --> 06:45.566
BECAUSE -- IF I MAY QUOTE THE

09:51.100 --> 09:53.033

09:53.100 --> 09:54.400
FIRST: MANHATTAN BEACH'S

09:54.466 --> 09:56.900
POPULATION IS ONLY 0.5% BLACK,

09:56.966 --> 09:58.200
SO EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT THAT

09:58.266 --> 10:00.300
COMMUNITY NOW, YOU DON'T LOOK

10:00.366 --> 10:02.333
UN-LIKE IT.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.566
AND SECOND: IF YOU TOOK

10:03.633 --> 10:05.533
SOMETHING WORTH $20 MILLION,

10:05.600 --> 10:08.733
$350,000 DOESN'T COVER IT.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.700
ESPECIALLY WHEN NONE OF THAT

10:11.766 --> 10:13.066
MONEY WENT TOWARD THE FAMILY

10:13.133 --> 10:14.400
YOU STOLE IT FROM.

10:14.466 --> 10:16.666
THERE'S PRETTY OBVIOUSLY ONLY

10:16.733 --> 10:17.933
TWO WAYS OF MAKING THIS RIGHT:

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
GIVE THE BRUCES $20 MILLION OR

10:19.566 --> 10:21.033
GIVE THEM THEIR LAND BACK.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.466
AND INCREDIBLY, THE LATTER MIGHT

10:22.533 --> 10:24.500
ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

10:24.566 --> 10:25.700
BECAUSE L.A. COUNTY, WHICH OWNS

10:25.766 --> 10:26.900
THE LAND, RECENTLY RELEASED A

10:26.966 --> 10:28.000
PLAN FOR RETURNING IT TO THE

10:28.066 --> 10:38.000
BRUCES.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.166
WHICH IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY,

10:39.233 --> 10:39.800
ABOUT TIME!

10:39.866 --> 10:40.700
IT'S LITERALLY BEEN CALLED

10:40.766 --> 10:43.166
BRUCE'S BEACH SINCE 2006.

10:43.233 --> 10:43.966
IS THE APOSTROPHE S A FUCKING

10:44.033 --> 10:44.400
JOKE TO YOU PEOPLE?

10:44.466 --> 10:45.133
IT INDICATES POSSESSION.

10:45.200 --> 10:45.833
SO THE STORY OF BRUCE'S BEACH

10:45.900 --> 10:46.400
MIGHT ACTUALLY END WITH

10:46.466 --> 10:47.066
SOMETHING APPROACHING JUSTICE.

10:47.133 --> 10:47.833
LAND WAS TAKEN AWAY.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.433
LAND IS GIVEN BACK.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.866
AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP THE

10:50.933 --> 10:51.866
ELEGANCE OF THAT SOLUTION IN

10:51.933 --> 10:53.366
MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT A FAR MORE

10:53.433 --> 10:55.033
INSIDIOUS AND WIDESPREAD FORM OF

10:55.100 --> 10:56.400
WEALTH APPROPRIATION, AND THAT

10:56.466 --> 10:59.866
IS HOUSING DISCRIMINATION.

10:59.933 --> 11:00.866
THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF IT IN

11:00.933 --> 11:02.333
AMERICA -- AND WE WILL GET TO

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
THAT IN A MINUTE -- BUT BEFORE

11:03.466 --> 11:04.866
WE DO, LET'S JUST START WITH ITS

11:04.933 --> 11:07.466
EFFECTS.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.166
CURRENTLY, ONLY 45% OF BLACK

11:09.233 --> 11:10.600
HOUSEHOLDERS OWN THEIR HOMES,

11:10.666 --> 11:12.366
COMPARED WITH NEARLY 74% OF

11:12.433 --> 11:14.433
WHITES.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.100
AND SINCE HOME OWNERSHIP IS A

11:16.166 --> 11:17.333
KEY COMPONENT OF WEALTH, IT'S NO

11:17.400 --> 11:18.433
SURPRISE THAT THE WEALTH GAP

11:18.500 --> 11:20.100
BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK FAMILIES

11:20.166 --> 11:22.100
IS SO HUGE, MANY LITERALLY DON'T

11:22.166 --> 11:24.766
COMPREHEND IT.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.000
ONE RECENT SURVEY FOUND MOST

11:27.066 --> 11:28.166
PEOPLE THINK THAT, FOR EVERY

11:28.233 --> 11:30.033
$100 IN WEALTH HELD BY A WHITE

11:30.100 --> 11:31.533
FAMILY, A BLACK FAMILY HAS $90,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.700
WHEN THE TRUTH IS, IT'S ACTUALLY

11:33.766 --> 11:37.700
CLOSER TO $13, WITH THE MEDIAN

11:37.766 --> 11:41.133
WHITE FAMILY HAVING A NET WORTH

11:41.200 --> 11:43.000
OF AROUND $188,000 AND THE

11:43.066 --> 11:43.866
MEDIAN BLACK FAMILY HAVING JUST

11:43.933 --> 11:46.533
OVER $24,000.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.066
BUT THE EFFECTS OF HOUSING

11:49.133 --> 11:51.600
DISCRIMINATION GO WELL BEYOND

11:51.666 --> 11:52.233
WEALTH, BECAUSE QUESTIONS ABOUT

11:52.300 --> 11:54.366
WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS AND HOW MUCH

11:54.433 --> 11:57.400
IT'S WORTH IMPACT SO MANY THINGS

11:57.466 --> 11:57.966
ABOUT YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.

11:58.033 --> 11:58.600
FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE A KEY WAY

11:58.666 --> 11:59.933
AMERICANS PAY FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS

12:00.000 --> 12:01.866
IS THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES,

12:01.933 --> 12:03.800
BETTER HOMES LEAD TO BETTER

12:03.866 --> 12:05.066
SCHOOLS, BETTER TEACHERS, AND

12:05.133 --> 12:06.333
MORE RESOURCES, WHICH IN TURNS

12:06.400 --> 12:07.800
LEADS BACK TO BETTER

12:07.866 --> 12:09.366
NEIGHBORHOODS IN GENERAL,

12:09.433 --> 12:10.333
INCLUDING CLEANER STREETS,

12:10.400 --> 12:11.966
CLEANER AIR, AND, CRUCIALLY,

12:12.033 --> 12:13.066
ONLY THE MOST EXCLUSIVE AND

12:13.133 --> 12:15.233
FUCKABLE TREES.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.300

12:18.066 --> 12:18.800

12:37.133 --> 12:42.433

12:42.500 --> 12:43.000

12:48.200 --> 12:50.000
PLEASE, DON'T SPOIL IT FOR

12:50.066 --> 12:51.100
EVERYONE ELSE --

12:51.166 --> 12:51.866
LET'S LET IT BE A SURPRISE.

12:51.933 --> 12:52.466
AND LET'S START IN THE EARLY

12:52.533 --> 12:53.666
20TH CENTURY, BECAUSE THAT'S

12:53.733 --> 12:54.366
WHEN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY

12:54.433 --> 12:55.800
REALLY BEGAN TO GROW, AND AS IT

12:55.866 --> 12:57.266
DID, WHITE PEOPLE MOVED QUICKLY

12:57.333 --> 12:58.500
TO CODIFY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN

12:58.566 --> 13:00.400
THEM AND BLACK PEOPLE.

13:00.466 --> 13:02.533
ONE MAJOR WAY THIS HAPPENED WAS

13:02.600 --> 13:03.700
THROUGH "RACIAL COVENANTS" --

13:03.766 --> 13:04.900
ESSENTIALLY BYLAWS WRITTEN INTO

DEEDS OR NEIGHBORHOOD

13:05.966 --> 13:07.933

13:08.000 --> 13:09.400
OF A HOUSE TO A NON-WHITE

13:09.466 --> 13:11.800
PERSON.

13:11.866 --> 13:12.866
AND INCREDIBLY, THESE COVENANTS

13:12.933 --> 13:14.066
WERE SO WIDESPREAD THAT MANY ARE

13:14.133 --> 13:16.966
STILL TECHNICALLY ON THE BOOKS.

13:39.666 --> 13:42.033
>> John: WELL, QUITE!

13:42.100 --> 13:43.300
THE TONE OF THAT "WHEW, OKAY" IS

13:43.366 --> 13:44.766
USUALLY RESERVED FOR A FEW

13:44.833 --> 13:46.466
THINGS: FINDING OUT YOUR GRANDMA

13:46.533 --> 13:48.133
IS STILL SENDING NUDES, THAT

13:48.200 --> 13:49.966
JEREMY PIVEN LAUNCHED A PODCAST

13:50.033 --> 13:51.433
CALLED "HOW YOU LIVIN',

13:51.500 --> 13:52.600
J PIVEN," AND THAT YOUR

13:52.666 --> 13:53.733
NEIGHBORHOOD TECHNICALLY STILL

13:53.800 --> 13:54.500
HAS BYLAWS PROHIBITING BLACK

13:54.566 --> 13:57.266
PEOPLE FROM LIVING THERE.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.833
AND WHILE RACIAL COVENANTS WERE

13:58.900 --> 14:01.533
DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, WHAT

14:01.600 --> 14:02.700
REALLY TURBOCHARGED SEGREGATION

14:02.766 --> 14:03.866
WAS WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

14:03.933 --> 14:05.366
GOT INVOLVED.

14:05.433 --> 14:06.733
IN THE 1930s, THE NEW DEAL

14:06.800 --> 14:08.300
ESTABLISHED THE FEDERAL HOUSING

14:08.366 --> 14:10.500
ADMINISTRATION AND THE HOME

14:10.566 --> 14:12.100
OWNERS LOAN CORPORATION OR

14:12.166 --> 14:13.933
"HOLC" -- WHICH IS,

14:14.000 --> 14:14.900
INCIDENTALLY, ALSO FRENCH FOR

14:14.966 --> 14:19.866
"HULK."

14:19.933 --> 14:21.366
EH, HOLC -- HOW YOU SAY, ER...

14:21.433 --> 14:22.400
LE SMUUSH.

14:22.466 --> 14:23.366
THE IDEA OF THESE TWO AGENCIES

14:23.433 --> 14:24.333
WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
TO BUY AND RETAIN HOUSES DURING

14:25.566 --> 14:26.966
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND THEY

14:27.033 --> 14:28.300
WERE PROMOTED AT THE TIME

14:28.366 --> 14:30.200
THROUGH NEWSREELS LIKE THIS:

14:30.266 --> 14:32.166
>> THIS COUPLE IS GOING THROUGH

14:32.233 --> 14:32.833
A MODEL HOUSE NOW -- SUPPOSE WE

14:32.900 --> 14:34.066
FOLLOW THEM.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.300
THE HUSBAND APPARENTLY ISN'T

14:35.366 --> 14:36.266
VERY KEEN ABOUT IT ALL, BUT YOU

14:36.333 --> 14:37.866
KNOW HOW WIVES ARE.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.500
THIS CHEERFUL ROOM WITH ITS MANY

14:39.566 --> 14:40.600
HANDY CABINETS IMPRESSES EVEN

14:40.666 --> 14:42.733
THIS SKEPTIC, AND HIS WIFE IS

14:42.800 --> 14:43.900
ENTRANCED BY THE MODERN FLAT TOP

14:43.966 --> 14:45.500
STOVE.

14:45.566 --> 14:47.733
TOO BAD THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT --

14:47.800 --> 14:50.133
AH, BUT MAYBE THEY CAN.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.266
WELL, ACCORDING TO THIS SIGN,

14:52.333 --> 14:53.100
THEY CAN BUY THIS HOUSE WITH

14:53.166 --> 14:54.300
MONTHLY PAYMENTS THAT ARE LESS

14:54.366 --> 14:55.266
THAN THEY NOW SPEND FOR RENT.

14:55.333 --> 14:56.966
>> John: WOW.

14:57.033 --> 14:57.733
THAT IS A VERY AFFORDABLE HOUSE

14:57.800 --> 14:58.700
FOR TWO PEOPLE THAT CLEARLY DO

14:58.766 --> 15:00.500
NOT GET ALONG.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.300
"YOU KNOW HOW HUSBANDS ARE: THEY

15:02.366 --> 15:03.700
HATE THEIR WIVES AND ANYTHING

15:03.766 --> 15:04.900
THAT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.066
EVERY MOMENT WITH THEM IS

15:06.133 --> 15:07.133
TORTURE.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.433
AND MAYBE A NEW HOUSE WOULD

15:08.500 --> 15:09.666
HELP, AS NEITHER OF THEM WILL

15:09.733 --> 15:11.333
LEAVE THIS WRETCHED MARRIAGE

15:11.400 --> 15:12.700
BECAUSE IT'S THE 1930s.

15:12.766 --> 15:13.533
IT'S UP TO THE BABY TO SAVE

15:13.600 --> 15:16.466
THEM!"

15:16.533 --> 15:17.600
THE PITCH WAS THAT THE

15:17.666 --> 15:19.200
GOVERNMENT WOULD INSURE YOUR

15:19.266 --> 15:20.500
LOAN SO THAT BANKS WOULD ACCEPT

15:20.566 --> 15:21.766
A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER DOWN

15:21.833 --> 15:23.200
PAYMENT THAN WAS STANDARD AT THE

15:23.266 --> 15:25.033
TIME, WITH MUCH LOWER INTEREST

15:25.100 --> 15:26.766
RATES, AND GIVE YOU DECADES TO

15:26.833 --> 15:29.200
PAY IT OFF.

15:29.266 --> 15:30.666
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

15:30.733 --> 15:31.900
ESSENTIALLY INVENTED THE MODERN

15:31.966 --> 15:33.100
HOME MORTGAGE, AND IT WORKED

15:33.166 --> 15:35.066
INCREDIBLY WELL.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.466
MILLIONS BOUGHT HOMES WHO COULD

15:36.533 --> 15:38.433
NEVER OTHERWISE HAVE AFFORDED

15:38.500 --> 15:39.900
THEM, BEGINNING A CYCLE OF

15:39.966 --> 15:41.400
STABLE, GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT

15:41.466 --> 15:43.233
CONTINUES TO THIS DAY.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.966
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

15:45.033 --> 15:52.366
I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.066
WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO TRAGIC

15:54.133 --> 15:55.433
THAT BUILT DIRECTLY INTO THAT

15:55.500 --> 15:56.900
PLAN WAS THE INTENTIONAL

15:56.966 --> 15:57.533
EXCLUSION OF BLACK PEOPLE.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.233
FOR INSTANCE, HOLC DEVELOPED

15:58.300 --> 15:59.400
MAPS THAT COLOR-CODED AREAS

15:59.466 --> 16:00.600
GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, OR RED

16:00.666 --> 16:02.333
BASED ON THEIR

16:02.400 --> 16:03.966
CREDIT-WORTHINESS.

16:04.033 --> 16:07.500
A NEIGHBORHOOD EARNED A RED

16:07.566 --> 16:12.133
COLOR -- OR BE "REDLINED" -- IF

16:12.200 --> 16:13.133
ANY AFRICAN AMERICANS LIVED IN

16:13.200 --> 16:13.833
IT AT ALL, AT WHICH POINT, THE

16:13.900 --> 16:14.600
AREA WAS ESSENTIALLY INELIGIBLE

16:14.666 --> 16:17.133
FOR ANY MORTGAGES.

16:17.200 --> 16:17.733
MEANWHILE, WHEN IT CAME TO NEW

16:17.800 --> 16:18.333
DEVELOPMENTS, THE FHA'S

16:18.400 --> 16:19.866
UNDERWRITING MANUAL ESSENTIALLY

16:19.933 --> 16:21.433
MANDATED THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE

16:21.500 --> 16:22.600
RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

16:22.666 --> 16:24.033
AS A PREREQUISITE TO RECEIVE

16:24.100 --> 16:26.233
MORTGAGE INSURANCE.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.933
THESE POLICIES ALONE HAD A

16:28.000 --> 16:29.566
DEVASTATING EFFECT ON BLACK

16:29.633 --> 16:30.800
COMMUNITIES, SIGNIFICANTLY

16:30.866 --> 16:32.600
EXPANDING AND LOCKING IN

16:32.666 --> 16:34.400
SEGREGATION.

16:34.466 --> 16:39.233
AND SOME DEVELOPERS ENSURED

16:39.300 --> 16:41.100
THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO QUALIFY

16:41.166 --> 16:41.633
FOR LOANS BY GOING TO SOME

16:41.700 --> 16:42.266
RIDICULOUS LENGTHS.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.900
>> HERE IN DETROIT, THERE WAS A

16:43.966 --> 16:45.500
DEVELOPER THAT WANTED TO BUILD A

16:45.566 --> 16:47.333
DEVELOPMENT FOR WHITES, AND THEY

16:47.400 --> 16:48.866
WANTED TO GET FHA LOANS.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.600
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID,

16:50.666 --> 16:52.366
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:52.433 --> 16:53.766
THERE'S A BLACK COMMUNITY KIND

16:53.833 --> 16:54.933
OF CLOSE BY, YOU DON'T GET THE

16:55.000 --> 16:59.200
GOOD LOANS."

16:59.266 --> 17:00.766
AND SO THE DEVELOPER, IN AN

17:00.833 --> 17:02.233
EFFORT TO TRY TO FIX THAT, BUILT

17:02.300 --> 17:05.133
A 6-FOOT-TALL WALL, A FOOT DEEP,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.000
TO SEPARATE THE BLACK COMMUNITY

17:07.066 --> 17:08.033
FROM THE EMERGING WHITE

17:08.100 --> 17:09.533
COMMUNITY.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.966
AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

17:11.033 --> 17:12.000
GAVE THE LOAN.

17:12.066 --> 17:13.533
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.233
AND WHAT MAKES IT SOMEHOW WORSE

17:15.300 --> 17:16.366
IS THAT THAT WALL WAS ONLY SIX

17:16.433 --> 17:18.000
FEET TALL.

17:18.066 --> 17:19.933
THAT'S JUST NOT THAT TALL.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
THAT'S LIKE THE HEIGHT OF A

17:21.066 --> 17:22.033
FRIDGE.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.300
OR A MATTRESS.

17:23.366 --> 17:24.633
OR SNOOP DOGG.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.833
SNOOP'S 6'4."

17:25.900 --> 17:27.233
HE COULD VERY EASILY SEE OVER

17:27.300 --> 17:28.200
IT.

17:28.266 --> 17:30.433
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.266
SNOOP MAKING DIRECT EYE CONTACT

17:31.333 --> 17:32.666
WITH YOU OVER YOUR STUPID,

17:32.733 --> 17:33.600
RACIST WALL?

17:33.666 --> 17:35.600
HOW IS THAT HELPING ANYONE?

17:35.666 --> 17:36.600
AND ALL OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

17:36.666 --> 17:38.666
HORRIFYING: WHITE PEOPLE

17:38.733 --> 17:39.933
BASICALLY WROTE "BLACK PEOPLE

17:40.000 --> 17:41.800
CAN'T LIVE HERE" ON PIECES OF

17:41.866 --> 17:43.133
PAPER AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

17:43.200 --> 17:44.300
SAID "IF YOU WHITE PEOPLE DON'T

17:44.366 --> 17:45.533
HAVE ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF

17:45.600 --> 17:49.266
PAPER, YOU CAN'T GET A LOAN."

17:49.333 --> 17:50.666
IF EVERYTHING HAD JUST STOPPED

17:50.733 --> 17:53.800
THERE, THE DAMAGE WOULD ALREADY

17:53.866 --> 17:54.866
HAVE BEEN IMMENSE.

17:54.933 --> 17:56.533
BUT IT VERY MUCH DID NOT STOP

17:56.600 --> 17:57.366
THERE.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.000
AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE GI BILL

17:59.066 --> 17:59.866
GAVE RETURNING SERVICE MEMBERS

17:59.933 --> 18:01.033
ACCESS TO HOME LOANS WITH AS

18:01.100 --> 18:02.600
LITTLE AS NO DOWN PAYMENT, WHICH

18:02.666 --> 18:05.333
IS GREAT!

18:05.400 --> 18:06.566
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

18:06.633 --> 18:08.500
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS STILL

18:08.566 --> 18:09.666
REFUSED TO APPROVE LOANS FOR

18:09.733 --> 18:11.466
AFRICAN AMERICANS, MEANING THAT

18:11.533 --> 18:13.100
BLACK SERVICE MEMBERS RETURNED

18:13.166 --> 18:14.700
HOME ONLY TO BE SHUT OUT OF

18:14.766 --> 18:16.533
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE RAPIDLY

18:16.600 --> 18:18.200
EXPANDING SUBURBS, ONE OF THE

18:18.266 --> 18:21.000
MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF WHICH

18:21.066 --> 18:22.566
WAS LEVITTOWN, A DEVELOPMENT ON

18:22.633 --> 18:24.600
LONG ISLAND OF OVER 17,000

18:24.666 --> 18:25.533
HOMES.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.933
AND TO ENSURE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

18:27.000 --> 18:28.466
TO BUILD THEM, THE DEVELOPER HAD

18:28.533 --> 18:30.066
THE CONTRACTS STATE THAT "THE

18:30.133 --> 18:31.366
HOME COULD NOT BE USED OR

18:31.433 --> 18:33.166
OCCUPIED BY ANY PERSON OTHER

18:33.233 --> 18:33.933
THAN MEMBERS OF THE CAUCASIAN

18:34.000 --> 18:36.333
RACE."

18:36.400 --> 18:37.700
AND WHEN BLACK PEOPLE DID TRY TO

18:37.766 --> 18:39.433
BUY HOMES THERE, THEY WERE TOLD

18:39.500 --> 18:41.633
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS JUST HOW

18:41.700 --> 18:43.100
UNWELCOME THEY WERE, AS THIS

18:43.166 --> 18:45.766
WOMAN REMEMBERS.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.233
>> WE WENT TO THE OFFICE WHERE

18:47.300 --> 18:47.900
THE GENTLEMAN WAS SHOWING THE

18:47.966 --> 18:51.433
HOUSES.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.533
SO MY HUSBAND SAID TO HIM, MY

18:52.600 --> 18:53.933
WIFE AND I ARE INTERESTED IN,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.200
YOU KNOW, PURCHASING A HOME HERE

18:55.266 --> 19:00.400
IN LEVITTOWN.

19:00.466 --> 19:01.333
HE SAID, GET YOUR [BLEEP] OUT OF

19:01.400 --> 19:03.266
HERE.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.633
>> John: WOW.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.433
THAT IS A SWEET LADY

19:06.500 --> 19:07.100
RECOUNTING AN APPALLING STORY IN

19:07.166 --> 19:08.100
JUST THE MOST MATTER-OF-FACT

19:08.166 --> 19:08.400
WAY.

19:08.466 --> 19:09.300
BUT I GUESS FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN

19:09.366 --> 19:10.200
AMERICA, YOU ASK YOUR GRANDMA TO

19:10.266 --> 19:10.966
TELL YOU A WHOLESOME STORY ABOUT

19:11.033 --> 19:13.533
SOMETHING LIKE THE FIRST SCHOOL

19:13.600 --> 19:14.433
DANCE SHE WENT TO OR HOW SHE

19:14.500 --> 19:15.166
AND GRANDPA BOUGHT A HOUSE, AND

19:15.233 --> 19:15.966
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE YOU'RE

19:16.033 --> 19:17.000
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

19:17.066 --> 19:18.966
AUGUST WILSON PLAY.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.600
AND CRUCIALLY, WHITE PEOPLE WHO

19:20.666 --> 19:21.966
WERE ABLE TO BUY HOMES IN

19:22.033 --> 19:23.266
LEVITTOWN COULD ACCUMULATE

19:23.333 --> 19:25.300
MASSIVE WEALTH.

19:25.366 --> 19:28.100
IN 1948, HOMES THERE SOLD FOR

19:28.166 --> 19:30.233
AROUND $8,000, OR ABOUT $75,000

19:30.300 --> 19:33.133
IN TODAY'S MONEY, AND THEY

19:33.200 --> 19:35.400
CURRENTLY SELL FOR $350,000 OR

19:35.466 --> 19:37.566
MORE, MEANING FAMILIES WHO

19:37.633 --> 19:39.533
BOUGHT HOMES BACK IN 1948 GAINED

19:39.600 --> 19:40.933
MORE THAN $200,000 IN WEALTH.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.433
THAT'S A LOT!

19:44.500 --> 19:46.033
SO, QUICK SIDE NOTE: IF YOU'RE

19:46.100 --> 19:47.300
YOUNG, WHITE, AND LOOKING FOR A

19:47.366 --> 19:48.533
REAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT,

19:48.600 --> 19:49.833
FORGET ABOUT YOUR AMC AND

19:49.900 --> 19:51.900
GAMESTOP STONKS.

19:51.966 --> 19:53.033
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS

19:53.100 --> 19:54.233
GET A TIME MACHINE, TRAVEL BACK

19:54.300 --> 19:55.666
TO THE 1940s, AND BUY A HOUSE

19:55.733 --> 19:57.100
IN A SEGREGATED SUBURB.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.466
IT'S THE SAFEST INVESTMENT

19:58.533 --> 20:00.433
YOU'LL EVER MAKE.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.433
AND LEVITTOWN AND DETROIT WERE

20:01.500 --> 20:02.966
BY NO MEANS ALONE.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.500
THIS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN,

20:05.566 --> 20:07.066
SO MUCH SO THAT THE EXCLUSION OF

20:07.133 --> 20:08.566
BLACK PEOPLE FROM THESE FEDERAL

20:08.633 --> 20:11.533
PROGRAMS WAS NEARLY ABSOLUTE.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.000
FOR INSTANCE, A SURVEY OF 13

20:13.066 --> 20:15.466
CITIES IN MISSISSIPPI IN 1947

20:15.533 --> 20:18.100
FOUND THAT -- OF THE MORE THAN

20:18.166 --> 20:19.766
3,200 LOANS GIVEN TO RETURNING

20:19.833 --> 20:23.333
VETERANS UNDER THE GI BILL --

20:23.400 --> 20:24.600
ONLY TWO WENT TO

20:24.666 --> 20:25.900
AFRICAN AMERICANS.

20:25.966 --> 20:27.266
AND NATIONWIDE, IN JUST THE

20:27.333 --> 20:29.033
FIRST QUARTER CENTURY OF THE

20:29.100 --> 20:32.300
FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION,

20:32.366 --> 20:34.933
THE GOVERNMENT INSURED OVER

20:35.033 --> 20:36.533
$40 BILLION IN LOANS.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.700
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF NEARLY

20:38.766 --> 20:40.566
$400 BILLION TODAY.

20:40.633 --> 20:41.666
BUT SOME ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT

20:41.733 --> 20:43.566
98% OF THEM WENT TO WHITE

20:43.633 --> 20:43.833
AMERICANS.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.400
98%!

20:45.466 --> 20:46.833
IF YOU ATE 98% OF SOMEONE'S

20:46.900 --> 20:49.666
CANNOLI, YOU ATE ALL THEIR

20:49.733 --> 20:50.966
CANNOLI.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.233
POINTING OUT THE FACT THEY'VE

20:52.300 --> 20:53.133
STILL TECHNICALLY GOT 2%

20:53.200 --> 20:56.633
SOMEHOW MAKES IT WORSE.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.666
AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF

20:57.733 --> 20:59.066
THIS CAN BE HARD FOR SOME TO

20:59.133 --> 21:01.233
THINK ABOUT.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.833
EARLIER THIS YEAR, CBS'

21:02.900 --> 21:04.766
TONY DOKOUPIL DID A STORY ABOUT

21:04.833 --> 21:05.633
HIS GRANDPARENTS' HOMETOWN OF

21:05.700 --> 21:06.733
LYNDHURST, NEW JERSEY, AND IN

21:06.800 --> 21:08.566
DOING SO, BROKE SOME DIFFICULT

21:08.633 --> 21:09.433
NEWS TO THE TOWN'S UNOFFICIAL

21:09.500 --> 21:10.466
HISTORIAN.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.166
>> WAIT A MINUTE.

21:12.233 --> 21:12.900
YOU'RE TELLING ME THEY WERE ONLY

21:12.966 --> 21:14.066
GOING TO MORTGAGE WHITE PEOPLE?

21:14.133 --> 21:16.600
>> YEAH, YEAH.

21:16.666 --> 21:21.366
>> FOR YOU TO SAY THAT LYNDHURST

21:21.433 --> 21:21.966
IS THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT

21:22.033 --> 21:22.666
ALMOST IMPLIES THAT LYNDHURST

21:22.733 --> 21:24.666
WAS RACIST.

21:24.733 --> 21:25.566
>> NO, THIS IS MY FAMILY TOO.

21:25.633 --> 21:26.166
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

21:26.233 --> 21:26.800
I'M SAYING THAT WE -- I'M SAYING

21:26.866 --> 21:27.166
WE HAD NO IDEA.

21:27.233 --> 21:27.800
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:27.866 --> 21:28.733
MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN

21:28.800 --> 21:29.366
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD

21:29.433 --> 21:31.233
THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.033
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I GET THAT

21:32.100 --> 21:33.900
THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT I

21:33.966 --> 21:40.366
WILL SAY, IF A WHITE PERSON SAYS

21:40.433 --> 21:42.666
"THAT ALMOST IMPLIES BLANK WAS

21:42.733 --> 21:48.600
RACIST" AND ANOTHER ONE SAYS

21:48.666 --> 21:49.933
"NO, NO, THIS IS MY FAMILY TOO,"

21:50.000 --> 21:50.666
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE MATTER'S

21:50.733 --> 21:51.200
CLOSED.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.133
IF TWO WHITE PEOPLE ARE TRYING

21:52.200 --> 21:52.700
TO FIGURE OUT IF SOMETHING'S

21:52.766 --> 21:53.300
RACIST, NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,

21:53.366 --> 21:53.666
IT PROBABLY IS.

21:53.733 --> 21:56.700
AS FOR THAT MAN'S CLAIM "MOST

21:56.766 --> 22:00.566
PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN

22:00.633 --> 22:01.200
THIS PROGRAM WAS IN PLACE," HOLD

22:01.266 --> 22:01.700
ON.

22:01.766 --> 22:02.466
NONE OF THIS WAS A SECRET AT THE

22:02.533 --> 22:03.133
TIME.

22:03.200 --> 22:03.966
THE LINK BETWEEN THE RACIAL

22:04.033 --> 22:04.866
MAKEUP OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND

22:04.933 --> 22:05.566
THE VALUE OF YOUR HOME WAS SO

22:05.633 --> 22:06.600
WELL-ESTABLISHED, SOME

22:06.666 --> 22:08.100
SPECULATORS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT

22:08.166 --> 22:09.366
TO BUY HOMES ON THE CHEAP

22:09.433 --> 22:10.700
THROUGH A PRACTICE CALLED

22:10.766 --> 22:12.800
"BLOCKBUSTING."

22:12.866 --> 22:13.900
THAT'S WHERE THEY'D GO TO A

22:13.966 --> 22:15.233
WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MAKE IT

22:15.300 --> 22:16.600
SEEM LIKE BLACK PEOPLE WERE

22:16.666 --> 22:17.633
MOVING IN.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.066
THEY WOULD HIRE A BLACK WOMAN TO

22:19.133 --> 22:22.333
WALK UP AND DOWN THE STREET WITH

22:22.400 --> 22:23.666
A STROLLER, OR CALL HOMES AND

22:23.733 --> 22:24.833
ASK TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WITH A

22:24.900 --> 22:26.800
STEREOTYPICALLY BLACK NAME.

22:26.866 --> 22:28.066
THE IDEA WAS THAT SIMPLY BY

22:28.133 --> 22:29.566
DOING THIS, THE SPECULATORS

22:29.633 --> 22:30.766
COULD PANIC WHITE HOMEOWNERS

22:30.833 --> 22:32.600
INTO SELLING THEIR HOMES AT A

22:32.666 --> 22:34.100
LOSS.

22:34.166 --> 22:34.866
THIS TACTIC WAS INCREDIBLY

22:34.933 --> 22:36.500
EFFECTIVE.

22:36.566 --> 22:38.366
BUT I WILL SAY, SOME WHITE

22:38.433 --> 22:39.333
HOMEOWNERS DID STAND FIRM --

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
LIKE THIS AMAZING WOMAN IN

22:40.466 --> 22:42.166
BALTIMORE:

22:42.233 --> 22:43.166
>> WELL, I HAPPENED TO BE

22:43.233 --> 22:44.666
SITTING ON THE STEPS WITH A

22:44.733 --> 22:46.366
FRIEND OF MINE, AND THE MAN THAT

22:46.433 --> 22:47.566
HAD GOTTEN THE HOUSE FROM THE

22:47.633 --> 22:49.100
WOMAN NEXT DOOR, HE CAME UP AND

22:49.166 --> 22:50.733
HE SAID TO ME, "WOULD YOU LIKE

22:50.800 --> 22:52.600
TO SELL?"

22:52.666 --> 22:53.733
AND I SAID, "NO, I COULDN'T

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
AFFORD TO SELL, BECAUSE I CAN'T

22:54.866 --> 22:58.366
AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE."

22:58.433 --> 22:59.633
AND HE SAID, "YOU WON'T SELL?"

22:59.700 --> 23:03.833
I SAID, "NO."

23:03.900 --> 23:04.766
HE SAYS, "WELL" --

23:04.833 --> 23:05.433
PARDON ME, ANGIE, THESE ARE NOT

23:05.500 --> 23:06.033
MY WORDS.

23:06.100 --> 23:10.900
HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

23:10.966 --> 23:11.933
DO WHEN THESE [BLEEP] MOVE IN

23:12.000 --> 23:12.533
HERE, AND THEY GET OUT ON THE

23:12.600 --> 23:13.200
PORCH IN THE SUMMER AND THEY

23:13.266 --> 23:13.600
DRINK BEER?"

23:13.666 --> 23:14.800
I SAID, "HELL, I'M GOING TO JOIN

23:14.866 --> 23:17.566
THEM."

23:17.633 --> 23:18.033
[LAUGHTER]

23:18.100 --> 23:19.266
>> John: LOOK, I KNOW THIS STORY

23:19.333 --> 23:20.100
IS FULL OF TERRIBLE PEOPLE AND

23:20.166 --> 23:20.766
UNMITIGATED RACISM, SO WE SHOULD

23:20.833 --> 23:21.300
PROBABLY TAKE A MOMENT TO

23:21.366 --> 23:22.266
CELEBRATE A LADY WHO JUST WANTED

23:22.333 --> 23:23.233
TO GET DRUNK ON HER PORCH WITH

23:23.300 --> 23:23.833
HER NEIGHBORS REGARDLESS OF

23:23.900 --> 23:25.166
THEIR COLOR.

23:25.233 --> 23:27.333
I LOVE SO MANY THINGS ABOUT

23:27.400 --> 23:28.066
THAT:

23:28.133 --> 23:30.700
I LOVE ROSE'S DON'T-GIVE-A-FUCK

23:30.766 --> 23:31.800
ENERGY, BUT ALSO ANGIE'S "ROSE

23:31.866 --> 23:33.933
IS GONNA ROSE" RESPONSE.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.633
BECAUSE WHEN ROSE SAID, "PARDON

23:35.700 --> 23:36.200
ME, ANGIE, THESE ARE NOT MY

23:36.266 --> 23:37.666
WORDS," THAT WAS FOR US.

23:37.733 --> 23:39.066
ANGIE KNEW.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.300
SHE KNOWS WHO ROSE IS AND SHE'S

23:40.366 --> 23:42.166
MADE PEACE WITH IT.

23:42.233 --> 23:43.866
THESE WOMEN HAVE TALKED.

23:43.933 --> 23:44.566
THERE'S A HISTORY IN THAT

23:44.633 --> 23:45.900
RELATIONSHIP.

23:45.966 --> 23:46.933
BLESS YOU, ROSE.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.366
AND BLESS ANGIE TOO.

23:48.433 --> 23:50.133
JUST BECAUSE ROSE WAS AN ALLY

23:50.200 --> 23:51.666
DOESN'T MEAN SHE WAS ALWAYS AN

23:51.733 --> 23:54.433
EASY PERSON TO BE AROUND.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.866
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

23:55.933 --> 23:57.366
TOGETHER, IT IS NO WONDER THAT

23:57.433 --> 23:58.800
BY THE LATE '60s, FAIR HOUSING

23:58.866 --> 24:00.133
HAD BECOME A CORE ISSUE FOR THE

24:00.200 --> 24:01.966
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

24:02.033 --> 24:03.166
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S EFFORTS TO

24:03.233 --> 24:05.466
COMBAT HOUSING DISCRIMINATION IN

24:05.533 --> 24:07.733
CHICAGO WERE MET WITH FIERCE

24:07.800 --> 24:09.700
RESISTANCE, AND UPRISINGS

24:09.766 --> 24:11.666
BEGAN TO BREAK OUT ACROSS THE

24:11.733 --> 24:13.400
COUNTRY -- UNREST THAT REACHED A

24:13.466 --> 24:15.100
FEVER PITCH IN THE WAKE OF

24:15.166 --> 24:15.866
KING'S ASSASSINATION.

24:15.933 --> 24:17.533
LBJ AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS

24:17.600 --> 24:19.100
TRIED TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN WITH

24:19.166 --> 24:21.466
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1968,

24:21.533 --> 24:24.033
WITH SECTIONS 8 AND 9 BEING THE

24:24.100 --> 24:25.666
FAIR HOUSING ACT, AND SECTION

24:25.733 --> 24:29.300
10, TITLED "CIVIL OBEDIENCE" --

24:29.366 --> 24:30.633
AN ANTI-RIOT ACT -- WHICH IS A

24:30.700 --> 24:32.866
PRETTY EFFECTIVE WAY OF SAYING

24:32.933 --> 24:34.766
"THAT'S OUR FINAL OFFER, WE'VE

24:34.833 --> 24:36.166
GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS WE'RE GOING

24:36.233 --> 24:36.866
WITH THIS WHOLE 'CIVIL RIGHTS'

24:36.933 --> 24:38.200
THING."

24:38.266 --> 24:39.400
THE FAIR HOUSING ACT MADE

24:39.466 --> 24:41.366
HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ILLEGAL

24:41.433 --> 24:43.100
AND ALSO REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT

24:43.166 --> 24:44.233
TO "AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER" FAIR

24:44.300 --> 24:45.466
HOUSING -- IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE

24:45.533 --> 24:48.200
AN ACTIVE ROLE IN INTEGRATION.

24:48.266 --> 24:52.000
AND TO HIS CREDIT, NIXON'S

24:52.066 --> 24:58.100
HOUSING SECRETARY,

24:58.166 --> 24:59.000
GEORGE ROMNEY, MITT'S DAD,

24:59.066 --> 24:59.633
ACTUALLY TRIED

24:59.700 --> 25:00.333
TO DO THAT AND DEVELOPED A

25:00.400 --> 25:00.900
PROGRAM TO WITHHOLD FEDERAL

25:00.966 --> 25:01.766
GRANTS FROM COMMUNITIES THAT

25:01.833 --> 25:02.933
REFUSED TO INTEGRATE.

25:03.000 --> 25:03.900
BUT NIXON THEN QUICKLY STEPPED

25:03.966 --> 25:05.300
IN, CALLING IT OFF, AND PUBLICLY

25:05.366 --> 25:11.300
REPUDIATING THE WHOLE PLAN.

25:11.366 --> 25:12.733
>> CONCERNING GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S

25:12.800 --> 25:14.200
PLAN, TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD THE

25:14.266 --> 25:15.633
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USE ITS

25:15.700 --> 25:17.266
LEVERAGE TO PROMOTE RACIAL

25:17.333 --> 25:21.533
INTEGRATION IN SUBURBAN HOUSING?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.266
>> IT IS NOT THE POLICY OF THIS

25:22.333 --> 25:23.066
GOVERNMENT TO USE THE POWER OF

25:23.133 --> 25:24.366
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR

25:24.433 --> 25:25.300
FEDERAL FUNDS IN ANY OTHER WAY,

25:25.366 --> 25:26.300
IN WAYS NOT REQUIRED BY THE LAW,

25:26.366 --> 25:27.066
FOR FORCED INTEGRATION OF THE

25:27.133 --> 25:28.133
SUBURBS.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.800
I BELIEVE THAT FORCED

25:29.866 --> 25:30.800
INTEGRATION OF THE SUBURBS IS

25:30.866 --> 25:35.433
NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.266
>> John: YEAH, NOT GREAT.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.300
AND IT IS WORTH REMINDING

25:37.366 --> 25:37.900
YOURSELF ONCE IN A WHILE JUST

25:37.966 --> 25:39.266
HOW DEEPLY WEIRD NIXON WAS.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.600
HE'S BEEN RENDERED SO SILLY BY A

25:40.666 --> 25:42.000
LIFETIME OF CARTOONISH

25:42.066 --> 25:44.033
IMPRESSIONS, IT'S GENUINELY

25:44.100 --> 25:46.233
UNSETTLING TO WATCH HIM MAKE

25:46.300 --> 25:48.366
UNYIELDING EYE CONTACT WHILE

25:48.433 --> 25:49.700
SAYING "I BELIEVE THAT FORCED

25:49.766 --> 25:50.466
INTEGRATION OF THE SUBURBS IS

25:50.533 --> 25:51.833
NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST"

25:51.900 --> 25:53.200
LIKE A COLD ROBOT POWERED BY

25:53.266 --> 25:58.100
RACISM.

25:58.166 --> 25:59.100
ALL I'M SAYING IS, IT REALLY

25:59.166 --> 25:59.733
SAYS SOMETHING THAT

25:59.800 --> 26:00.733
THE MOST HUMAN VERSION OF NIXON

26:00.800 --> 26:01.633
IS THE ONE WHERE HE'S A CARTOON

26:01.700 --> 26:02.166
HEAD IN A JAR.

26:02.233 --> 26:03.600
AND WHAT NIXON MADE VERY CLEAR

26:03.666 --> 26:04.533
THERE IS THAT THE FEDERAL

26:04.600 --> 26:06.233
GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT STEP IN TO

26:06.300 --> 26:08.300
INTEGRATE NEIGHBORHOODS, MEANING

26:08.366 --> 26:09.133
NEIGHBORHOODS WEREN'T GOING TO

26:09.200 --> 26:10.966
INTEGRATE.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.200
PRICES IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

26:12.266 --> 26:13.666
WERE NOW TOO HIGH, AND THE

26:13.733 --> 26:14.866
RACIAL WEALTH GAP WAS FIRMLY

26:14.933 --> 26:16.400
ENTRENCHED.

26:16.466 --> 26:18.600
AND EVEN THOUGH OVERT

26:18.666 --> 26:19.733
DISCRIMINATION WAS NOW ILLEGAL,

26:19.800 --> 26:21.500
THERE WERE, AND STILL ARE, MANY,

26:21.566 --> 26:23.066
MANY WAYS FOR NEIGHBORHOODS TO

26:23.133 --> 26:25.766
KEEP THEMSELVES WHITE.

26:25.833 --> 26:26.866
SOMETIMES IT'S THROUGH ZONING --

26:26.933 --> 26:29.033
LIKE BANNING MULTI-FAMILY HOMES

26:29.100 --> 26:35.200
AND SOMETIMES IT COMES IN THE

26:35.266 --> 26:36.366
FORM OF REALTORS STEERING BUYERS

26:36.433 --> 26:37.400
AWAY FROM CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS

26:37.466 --> 26:38.533
ON A RACIAL BASIS.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.633
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO

26:39.700 --> 26:40.800
THAT, BUT IT STILL HAPPENS ALL

26:40.866 --> 26:49.333
THE TIME.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.466
A FEW YEARS AGO, "NEWSDAY" HAD

26:50.533 --> 26:51.100
TESTERS OF MULTIPLE RACES POSE

26:51.166 --> 26:51.700
AS HOMEBUYERS ON LONG ISLAND,

26:51.766 --> 26:52.166
AND THE BLACK TESTERS

26:52.233 --> 26:52.866
EXPERIENCED DISPARATE TREATMENT

26:52.933 --> 26:53.633
NEARLY HALF THE TIME.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.666
IN SOME CASES, THEY WERE SENT TO

26:54.733 --> 26:56.000
VASTLY DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.

26:56.066 --> 26:57.466
BUT EVEN A REALTOR WHO "NEWSDAY"

26:57.533 --> 26:59.466
SAID GAVE OUT SIMILAR LISTINGS

26:59.533 --> 27:01.766
TO BLACK AND WHITE BUYERS --

27:01.833 --> 27:03.533
THEREBY STAYING OUTSIDE

27:03.600 --> 27:05.500
THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF

27:05.566 --> 27:07.166
"STEERING" -- ACCOMPANIED THEM

27:07.233 --> 27:08.800
WITH SOME NOT-SO-SUBTLE TIPS

27:08.866 --> 27:09.433
THAT SHE ONLY GAVE TO THE WHITE

27:09.500 --> 27:11.433
TESTER.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.300
>> AND THEN THERE'S POCKETS OF

27:14.366 --> 27:20.966
PORT JEFF TOO, THAT, YOU KNOW,

27:21.033 --> 27:21.800
DOWN BY THE TRAIN THERE'S AN

27:21.866 --> 27:23.133
AREA THERE.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.066
WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS, TO WOMEN,

27:25.133 --> 27:26.300
FOLLOW THE SCHOOL BUS, SEE THE

27:26.366 --> 27:27.333
MOMS THAT ARE HANGING OUT ON THE

27:27.400 --> 27:29.833
CORNERS.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.033
THERE WAS ONE FELLA WHO, LIKE,

27:31.100 --> 27:31.733
INSISTED ON THIS HOUSE AND THE

27:31.800 --> 27:32.666
WIFE WAS PREGNANT, HAD A LITTLE

27:32.733 --> 27:34.166
ONE.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.766
AND I SAID TO HIM, I CAN'T SAY

27:35.833 --> 27:37.066
ANYTHING, BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU --

27:37.133 --> 27:37.866
I WANT YOU TO GO THERE AT 10:00

27:37.933 --> 27:38.766
AT NIGHT WITH YOUR WIFE TO BUY

27:38.833 --> 27:39.666
DIAPERS.

27:39.733 --> 27:40.933
GO TO THAT 7-ELEVEN.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.300
THEY DIDN'T BUY THERE.

27:46.366 --> 27:47.000
[LAUGHS]

27:47.066 --> 27:47.466
>> NO, THAT'S GREAT.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.233
>> I HAVE TO SAY IT WITHOUT

27:48.300 --> 27:49.166
SAYING IT, YOU KNOW.

27:49.233 --> 27:49.766
YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

27:49.833 --> 27:50.400
AREAS, YOU KNOW.

27:50.466 --> 27:50.733
>> YES.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.100
>> I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD

27:52.166 --> 27:52.800
"STEER," BUT I TRY TO -- I USE

27:52.866 --> 27:53.533
ANOTHER WORD.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.000
I EDUCATE IN THE AREA, YOU KNOW.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.633
>> John: OH, WELL, THAT'S ALL

27:56.700 --> 27:57.533
RIGHT THEN.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.833
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY THE

27:58.900 --> 28:00.400
WORD "STEER," IT'S OKAY.

28:00.466 --> 28:01.600
IT'S LIKE TABOO.

28:01.666 --> 28:03.133
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY ONE OF

28:03.200 --> 28:04.800
THE FIVE WORDS ON THE CARD,

28:04.866 --> 28:07.266
YOU'RE COMPLETELY IN THE CLEAR.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.133
AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS,

28:09.200 --> 28:10.100
BLACK HOMEBUYERS ARE FACED WITH

28:10.166 --> 28:11.833
DISCRIMINATION.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.733
A FEW YEARS AGO, REPORTERS

28:13.800 --> 28:15.366
CRUNCHED THROUGH 31 MILLION LOAN

28:15.433 --> 28:17.600
APPLICATIONS AND FOUND THAT

28:17.666 --> 28:18.966
AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE TO BE

28:19.033 --> 28:20.900
ROUTINELY DENIED CONVENTIONAL

28:20.966 --> 28:21.900
MORTGAGE LOANS AT MUCH HIGHER

28:22.000 --> 28:23.433
RATES, EVEN CONTROLLING FOR

28:23.500 --> 28:24.300
INCOME, LOAN AMOUNT, AND

28:24.366 --> 28:26.000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

28:26.066 --> 28:27.900
AND EVEN IF YOU OWN YOUR HOME,

28:27.966 --> 28:29.200
THE SIMPLE ACT OF HAVING IT

28:29.266 --> 28:31.200
APPRAISED CAN BE TAINTED BY

28:31.266 --> 28:33.233
DISCRIMINATION.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.566
THIS WOMAN HAD HAD HER HOME

28:34.633 --> 28:36.433
APPRAISED TWICE, BUT THE VALUES

28:36.500 --> 28:39.266
SEEMED LOW TO HER, SO SHE DID A

28:39.333 --> 28:44.533
LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.333
>> I MET WITH TWO OF MY

28:45.400 --> 28:45.833
GIRLFRIENDS.

28:45.900 --> 28:46.466
BOTH OF THEM ARE MARRIED TO

28:46.533 --> 28:47.266
WHITE MEN, AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY,

28:47.333 --> 28:48.166
I NEED TO BORROW ONE OF YOUR

28:48.233 --> 28:48.566
HUSBANDS.

28:48.633 --> 28:49.366
>> WHEN THE THIRD APPRAISER

28:49.433 --> 28:49.966
CAME, DUFFY WAS GONE.

28:50.033 --> 28:51.366
HER FRIEND'S HUSBAND POSED AS

28:51.433 --> 28:52.000
HER BROTHER.

28:52.066 --> 28:52.900
THE RESULT?

28:52.966 --> 28:55.166
DUFFY'S HOME WAS APPRAISED FOR

28:55.233 --> 28:56.866
$259,000, MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT

28:56.933 --> 28:58.800
OF HER PREVIOUS TWO APPRAISALS.

28:58.866 --> 29:01.933
>> I SCREAMED WITH JOY.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.200
I JUST WAS -- I WAS SO ELATED.

29:05.266 --> 29:06.833
AND THEN IT JUST -- IT QUICKLY

29:06.900 --> 29:09.400
DISSIPATED.

29:09.466 --> 29:16.766
AND THEN I JUST CRIED.

29:16.833 --> 29:20.300
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ACTUAL

29:20.366 --> 29:21.233
"THERE IT IS" IN THAT

29:21.300 --> 29:22.400
I'M THE THING

29:22.466 --> 29:24.300
THAT'S THE DEVALUING MY HOUSE.

29:24.366 --> 29:25.566
>> John: LOOK, THAT'S JUST

29:25.633 --> 29:26.766
AWFUL.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.566
WE ALL KNOW THE ONLY TIME THE

29:28.633 --> 29:29.733
ADDITION OF A WHITE MAN SHOULD

29:29.800 --> 29:30.866
INCREASE VALUE TO ANYTHING IS IF

29:30.933 --> 29:32.400
THAT THING IS A MOVIE AND THAT

29:32.466 --> 29:34.033
WHITE MAN IS STANLEY TUCCI.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.700
OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST NOT OKAY.

29:37.766 --> 29:39.933
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

29:40.000 --> 29:40.933
TOGETHER -- THE REDLINING, THE

29:41.000 --> 29:42.300
BLOCKBUSTING, THE STEERING, AND

29:42.366 --> 29:44.566
NOT LEAST, THE FEDERAL

29:44.633 --> 29:46.266
GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT -- IT

29:46.333 --> 29:47.600
ALL BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE MYTH

29:47.666 --> 29:48.666
OF WHITE AMERICANS' POST-WAR

29:48.733 --> 29:50.333
PROSPERITY, POWERED BY INGENUITY

29:50.400 --> 29:52.100
AND SELF-RELIANCE, LEAVES A LOT

29:52.166 --> 29:54.766
OUT.

29:54.833 --> 29:56.433
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THERE ARE

29:56.500 --> 29:58.266
MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO ARE

29:58.333 --> 29:59.500
UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS --

29:59.566 --> 30:00.833
OR, EVEN IF THEY DO, ARE UNSURE

30:00.900 --> 30:03.500
WHAT TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION.

30:03.566 --> 30:04.500
REMEMBER TONY DIKOUPIL'S STORY

30:04.566 --> 30:06.200
ABOUT LYNDHURST?

30:06.266 --> 30:07.400
THE MAYOR THERE, AND THE

30:07.466 --> 30:08.533
HISTORIAN, HAD VERY DIFFERENT

30:08.600 --> 30:09.833
REACTIONS TO WHAT THEY WERE

30:09.900 --> 30:11.133
LEARNING.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.933
>> THE ONE THING THAT I'M

30:13.000 --> 30:14.566
STRUGGLING WITH, AND THIS IS

30:14.633 --> 30:16.300
AS -- AS SOMEBODY WHOSE FAMILY

30:16.366 --> 30:18.800
CAME THROUGH HERE, IS WHEN I

30:18.866 --> 30:21.066
LOOKED AT THE OLD MAPS, JUST

30:21.133 --> 30:24.200
OVER THE RIVER, THE AREAS WERE

30:24.266 --> 30:27.333
REDLINED BY THE FEDERAL

30:27.400 --> 30:28.866
GOVERNMENT, MEANING THEY WEREN'T

30:28.933 --> 30:30.066
WORTHY OF MORTGAGES.

30:30.133 --> 30:31.700
AND LYNDHURST WASN'T REDLINED.

30:31.766 --> 30:32.866
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT

30:32.933 --> 30:33.866
KNOWLEDGE?

30:33.933 --> 30:34.733
>> YOU MOVE ON.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.033
COME ON, IT'S ALL GOD'S PEOPLE.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.333
>> NOW THAT WE DO KNOW --

30:38.400 --> 30:39.733
>> RIGHT.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.933
>> WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

30:43.000 --> 30:43.933
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GOOD

30:44.000 --> 30:45.333
QUESTION.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.000
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT,

30:46.066 --> 30:46.866
TONY.

30:46.933 --> 30:47.800
I WISH I DID.

30:47.866 --> 30:48.800
>> John: OKAY, WE'LL GET TO THE

30:48.866 --> 30:52.233
CONTENT OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING

30:52.300 --> 30:53.666
IN A SECOND, BUT FIRST, I GOTTA

30:53.733 --> 30:54.900
KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MAYOR

30:54.966 --> 30:56.400
AND HOW HE CAME INTO OFFICE.

30:56.466 --> 30:57.733
IF I HAD TO GUESS, A COUPLE

30:57.800 --> 30:59.166
OF CANDIDATES DISAPPEARED.

30:59.233 --> 30:59.800
YOU CAN'T HAVE A RUN-OFF IF ONLY

30:59.866 --> 31:00.433
ONE CANDIDATE IS ON THE BALLOT,

31:00.500 --> 31:01.700
CAN YOU?

31:01.766 --> 31:03.900
BUT AS NICE AS IT SOUNDS TO JUST

31:03.966 --> 31:06.033
MOVE ON, THAT'S NOT DEALING WITH

31:06.100 --> 31:08.500
THE UNDERLYING INJURY HERE.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.433
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAD A MAGIC

31:10.500 --> 31:12.300
WAND AND WERE ABLE TO STOP EVERY

31:12.366 --> 31:13.900
FACET OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION

31:13.966 --> 31:16.333
GOING FORWARD, YOU STILL

31:16.400 --> 31:20.200
WOULDN'T BE UNDOING THE DAMAGE

31:20.266 --> 31:21.066
THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

31:21.133 --> 31:22.533
HOME PRICES HAVE RISEN MUCH MORE

31:22.600 --> 31:24.100
THAN WAGES IN THE LAST 50 YEARS,

31:24.166 --> 31:25.400
SO BUYING A HOME TODAY DOESN'T

31:25.466 --> 31:26.900
CARRY THE SAME ECONOMIC PROMISE

31:26.966 --> 31:29.300
AS IT DID WHEN THE FHA STARTED.

31:29.366 --> 31:31.500
IN FACT, BY ONE ESTIMATE, IF WE

31:31.566 --> 31:33.333
DO "DO NOTHING AND MOVE ON," IT

31:33.400 --> 31:35.333
WOULD TAKE 200 YEARS FOR THE

31:35.400 --> 31:37.633
WEALTH GAP TO DISAPPEAR ON ITS

31:37.700 --> 31:39.133
OWN.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.433
AND YET, SO OFTEN, EFFORTS TO

31:40.500 --> 31:41.633
ADDRESS THE LEGACY OF HOUSING

31:41.700 --> 31:43.700
DISCRIMINATION HAVE BEEN

31:43.766 --> 31:47.966
RESOLUTELY COLOR-BLIND.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.533
HERE IS JOE BIDEN ON THE

31:49.600 --> 31:51.233
CAMPAIGN TRAIL JUST LAST YEAR:

31:51.300 --> 31:52.200
>> MY PLAN FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS

31:52.266 --> 31:55.166
TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP IS TO

31:55.233 --> 31:56.666
INVEST IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

31:56.733 --> 31:57.666
HOME OWNERSHIP.

31:57.733 --> 32:00.666
THAT INCLUDES MY INSISTING THAT

32:00.733 --> 32:01.300
THERE WILL BE A $15,000

32:01.366 --> 32:02.433
FIRST-TIME HOME BUYER TAX CREDIT

32:02.500 --> 32:04.200
FOR EVERYONE.

32:04.266 --> 32:05.500
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON THERE,

32:05.566 --> 32:08.500
JOE.

32:08.566 --> 32:10.333
"FOR EVERYONE"?

32:10.400 --> 32:14.133
THAT MIGHT SOUND GREAT, BUT IT

32:14.200 --> 32:16.000
ALSO FUNDAMENTALY DILUTES WHAT

32:16.066 --> 32:16.600
YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO

32:16.666 --> 32:16.800
HERE.

32:16.866 --> 32:17.433
BECAUSE WE'VE IMMEDIATELY GONE

32:17.500 --> 32:18.000
FROM TARGETED INVESTMENT IN

32:18.066 --> 32:18.633
BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP TO A BROAD

32:18.700 --> 32:21.600
TAX CREDIT FOR EVERYBODY.

32:21.666 --> 32:22.733
AND WE SURE SEEM TO BECOME A

32:22.800 --> 32:23.900
RAINBOW COALITION AS SOON AS THE

32:23.966 --> 32:24.933
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTS

32:25.000 --> 32:28.133
HANDING OUT CASH, DON'T WE?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.800
AND OUR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY

32:29.866 --> 32:31.600
TARGET SOLUTIONS BASED ON RACE

32:31.666 --> 32:33.366
HAS DOOMED POTENTIAL FIXES IN

32:33.433 --> 32:34.733
THE PAST.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.166
IN THE '70s, WE PASSED THE

32:36.233 --> 32:38.800
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

32:38.866 --> 32:40.400
REQUIRING BANKS TO APPROVE LOANS

32:40.466 --> 32:43.500
IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.

32:43.566 --> 32:44.733
BUT WE DIDN'T SPECIFY WHO THE

32:44.800 --> 32:45.866
LOANS HAD TO GO TO, WITH ONE

32:45.933 --> 32:47.033
ANALYSIS IN PHILADELPHIA SHOWING

32:47.100 --> 32:48.833
THAT BANKS AND LENDERS FAVORED

32:48.900 --> 32:50.133
WHITE BORROWERS, EVEN IN

32:50.200 --> 32:53.200
MAJORITY-BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS,

32:53.266 --> 32:54.400
MAKING THIS WELL-MEANING ACT

32:54.466 --> 32:55.833
BASICALLY A GENTRIFICATION

32:55.900 --> 32:59.233
MACHINE.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.000
ALTHOUGH NOT A LITERAL

33:00.066 --> 33:00.733
GENTRIFICATION MACHINE, OF

33:00.800 --> 33:01.666
COURSE, AS WE ALL KNOW, THOSE

33:01.733 --> 33:03.466
ARE OBVIOUSLY E-SCOOTERS.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.566
SO THAT APPROACH OF "MOVE ON,

33:05.633 --> 33:07.066
WE'RE ALL GOD'S PEOPLE" HASN'T

33:07.133 --> 33:08.800
FIXED THE PROBLEM.

33:08.866 --> 33:10.900
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT SECOND GUY,

33:10.966 --> 33:12.433
WHO SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WE

33:12.500 --> 33:13.300
SHOULD DO ABOUT IT, BUT WISHES

33:13.366 --> 33:15.766
HE HAD THE ANSWER?

33:15.833 --> 33:18.500
IF THAT IS TRUE, IF HE HONESTLY

33:18.566 --> 33:19.666
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT A MAJOR

33:19.733 --> 33:20.866
COMPONENT OF THE ANSWER SHOULD

33:20.933 --> 33:25.000
PROBABLY BE, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD

33:25.066 --> 33:26.100
NEWS FOR HIM, BECAUSE IT EXISTS,

33:26.166 --> 33:28.400
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND

33:28.466 --> 33:29.466
IT'S THE SAME ANSWER THAT MANY

33:29.533 --> 33:31.000
BLACK VIEWERS HAVE BEEN SHOUTING

33:31.066 --> 33:32.300
AT THEIR SCREEN FOR THE LAST 20

33:32.366 --> 33:33.000
MINUTES.

33:33.066 --> 33:34.766
BECAUSE IT'S REPARATIONS.

33:34.833 --> 33:35.833
AND THE FIRST THING TO SAY ABOUT

33:35.900 --> 33:37.100
THIS IS THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS A

33:37.166 --> 33:38.466
NEW ARGUMENT.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.100
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING THE CASE

33:40.166 --> 33:41.400
FOR REPARATIONS FOR GENERATIONS,

33:41.466 --> 33:42.600
AND THE HISTORY OF HOUSING

33:42.666 --> 33:44.533
DISCRIMINATION SPECIFICALLY MADE

33:44.600 --> 33:46.533
UP A LARGE PART OF TA-NEHISI

33:46.600 --> 33:47.900
COATES' AWARD-WINNING ESSAY "THE

33:47.966 --> 33:49.200
CASE FOR REPARATIONS" SEVEN

33:49.266 --> 33:51.100
YEARS AGO.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.833
AND YET, EVEN THOUGH REPARATIONS

33:52.900 --> 33:54.200
ARE CLEARLY NECESSARY,

33:54.266 --> 33:56.333
PRACTICAL, AND THE RIGHT THING

33:56.400 --> 33:58.233
TO DO, A POLL RECENTLY FOUND

33:58.300 --> 34:00.200
ONLY ONE IN TEN WHITE PEOPLE

34:00.266 --> 34:01.766
FAVOR THEM.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.700
AND SOME DISMISS THE SUBJECT

34:03.766 --> 34:05.266
RIGHT OUT OF HAND.

34:05.333 --> 34:06.700
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK

34:06.766 --> 34:08.633
REPARATIONS FOR SOMETHING THAT

34:08.700 --> 34:09.766
HAPPENED 150 YEARS AGO FOR WHOM

34:09.833 --> 34:10.833
NONE OF US CURRENTLY LIVING ARE

34:10.900 --> 34:15.600
RESPONSIBLE IS A GOOD IDEA.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.666
WE'VE, YOU KNOW, TRIED TO DEAL

34:17.733 --> 34:19.600
WITH OUR ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY

34:19.666 --> 34:22.666
BY FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR, BY

34:22.733 --> 34:23.533
PASSING A LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS

34:23.600 --> 34:26.766
LEGISLATION.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.400
WE'VE ELECTED AN

34:28.466 --> 34:29.833
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.033
I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS A WORK IN

34:32.100 --> 34:33.000
PROGRESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

34:33.066 --> 34:35.366
BUT NO ONE CURRENTLY ALIVE WAS

34:35.433 --> 34:39.933
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.600
>> John: WOW.

34:41.666 --> 34:42.800
REPARATIONS AREN'T A GOOD IDEA

34:42.866 --> 34:46.100
BECAUSE "WE'VE ELECTED AN

34:46.166 --> 34:49.100
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT"?

34:49.166 --> 34:49.933
WHO EXACTLY IS THE "WE" IN THAT

34:50.000 --> 34:50.666
SENTENCE, MITCH?

34:50.733 --> 34:51.400
BECAUSE AS I REMEMBER IT,

34:51.466 --> 34:52.200
ELECTING THAT PRESIDENT WAS

34:52.266 --> 34:53.933
BASICALLY YOUR LEAST FAVORITE

34:54.000 --> 34:55.200
THING AMERICA EVER DID, AND YOU

34:55.266 --> 34:56.233
VOWED TO DEVOTE EVERY WAKING

34:56.300 --> 34:57.633
MOMENT TO MAKING SURE IT DIDN'T

34:57.700 --> 34:58.900
HAPPEN AGAIN.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.200
"WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH OUR

35:00.266 --> 35:01.300
ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY BY

35:01.366 --> 35:03.033
FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR -- WHICH I

35:03.100 --> 35:04.300
DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A SIDE IN --

35:04.366 --> 35:05.866
BY PASSING CIVIL RIGHTS

35:05.933 --> 35:06.833
LEGISLATION -- WHICH I DIDN'T

35:06.900 --> 35:09.400
HAVE TO TAKE A POSITION ON --

35:09.466 --> 35:10.933
AND BY ELECTING AN

35:11.000 --> 35:12.433
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT --

35:12.500 --> 35:13.333
WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.366
THIS COUNTRY HAS COME A LONG

35:14.433 --> 35:14.866
WAY, AND, WITH GOD AS MY

35:14.933 --> 35:15.433
WITNESS, IT WILL NOT GO ANY

35:15.500 --> 35:17.133
FURTHER."

35:17.200 --> 35:18.166
BUT THE THING IS, WE'RE NOT

35:18.233 --> 35:19.933
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT

35:20.000 --> 35:21.066
REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY HERE --

35:21.133 --> 35:21.900
WE SHOULD, BUT THAT'S A

35:21.966 --> 35:23.500
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

35:23.566 --> 35:25.100
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING

35:25.166 --> 35:27.533
DISCRIMINATION.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.533
MITCH McCONNELL WAS BORN IN

35:28.600 --> 35:29.766
1942.

35:29.833 --> 35:31.700
THE FAIR HOUSING ACT WASN'T

35:31.766 --> 35:34.066
PASSED UNTIL 1968.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.633
THIS IS QUANTIFIABLE HARM DONE

35:35.700 --> 35:37.433
IN OUR LIFETIMES TO PEOPLE WHO

35:37.500 --> 35:40.166
ARE STILL ALIVE.

35:40.233 --> 35:41.800
AS FOR WHAT REPARATIONS COULD

35:41.866 --> 35:47.100
LOOK LIKE, THERE HAS BEEN A BILL

35:47.166 --> 35:48.966
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE FOR

35:49.033 --> 35:50.366
30 YEARS BY THE LATE

35:50.433 --> 35:52.066
JOHN CONYERS TO FORM A

35:52.133 --> 35:56.566
COMMISSION TO STUDY THIS, AND

35:56.633 --> 35:58.366
THIS YEAR THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

35:58.433 --> 35:59.866
COMMITTEE VOTED TO ADVANCE IT.

35:59.933 --> 36:00.600
SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW

36:00.666 --> 36:01.233
WHAT REPARATIONS COULD LOOK

36:01.300 --> 36:02.066
LIKE, WE CAN PASS THAT BILL AND

36:02.133 --> 36:02.566
FIND OUT.

36:02.633 --> 36:03.633
BUT TO BE CLEAR: WE DON'T REALLY

36:03.700 --> 36:04.800
NEED TO STUDY THE "WHETHER," WE

36:04.866 --> 36:05.500
JUST NEED TO STUDY THE "HOW."

36:05.566 --> 36:06.433
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE

36:06.500 --> 36:07.900
GOVERNMENT DID, AND WE KNOW THE

36:07.966 --> 36:09.966
EFFECT IT HAD.

36:10.033 --> 36:14.033
AND THERE ARE POTENTIAL MODELS

36:14.100 --> 36:15.666
FOR US TO LEARN FROM -- FROM

36:15.733 --> 36:17.266
GERMANY PAYING REPARATIONS TO

36:17.333 --> 36:18.666
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TO THE U.S.

36:18.733 --> 36:20.566
PAYING JAPANESE AMERICANS WHO

36:20.633 --> 36:21.400
WERE INTERNED IN WORLD WAR II.

36:21.466 --> 36:22.766
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE

36:22.833 --> 36:23.300
RECENT EXAMPLES, EVANSTON,

36:23.366 --> 36:24.600
ILLINOIS, RECENTLY VOTED TO USE

36:24.666 --> 36:25.233
REVENUE FROM LEGAL WEED TO

36:25.300 --> 36:26.933
PROVIDE GRANTS TO ASSIST BLACK

36:27.000 --> 36:27.733
PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE FROM 1919

36:27.800 --> 36:30.400
TO 1969 AND THEIR DESCENDANTS.

36:30.466 --> 36:31.733
NOW, DOES THAT PROGRAM FIX

36:31.800 --> 36:34.933
EVERYTHING?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.300
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

36:38.366 --> 36:39.233
ITS FIRST PHASE MAKES AVAILABLE

36:39.300 --> 36:41.133
UP TO $25,000 FOR EACH

36:41.200 --> 36:41.766
PARTICIPANT, WHO CAN ONLY SPEND

36:41.833 --> 36:42.333
THAT MONEY ON BUYING OR

36:42.400 --> 36:42.900
RENOVATING A HOUSE OR PAYING

36:43.000 --> 36:43.733
DOWN THEIR MORTGAGE.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.833
AND THE INITIAL BUDGET FOR THE

36:45.900 --> 36:46.866
PROGRAM IS ONLY $400,000, SO IT

36:46.933 --> 36:48.300
MIGHT WELL BE LIMITED TO 16

36:48.366 --> 36:53.100
PEOPLE.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.566
BUT IT IS AT LEAST A REAL

36:54.633 --> 36:55.666
ATTEMPT TO BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE AND

36:55.733 --> 36:57.433
REDRESS HARM.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.333
AND ULTIMATELY, THIS ISN'T

36:58.400 --> 36:59.266
SOMETHING CITIES, OR EVEN

36:59.333 --> 37:01.066
STATES, CAN DO ON THEIR OWN.

37:01.133 --> 37:03.500
IT TOOK THE POWER AND RESOURCES

37:03.566 --> 37:05.066
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

37:05.133 --> 37:06.766
ENFORCE RACISM ON THIS SCALE,

37:06.833 --> 37:08.633
AND ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

37:08.700 --> 37:10.200
CAN TRULY GRAPPLE WITH THE

37:10.266 --> 37:11.600
CONSEQUENCES.

37:11.666 --> 37:12.500
AND THERE ARE SOME -- LIKE

37:12.566 --> 37:13.533
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES -- WHO HAVE

37:13.600 --> 37:14.433
SOME PRETTY SPECIFIC IDEAS ON

37:14.500 --> 37:15.633
WHAT THAT GRAPPLING COULD LOOK

37:15.700 --> 37:20.266
LIKE.

37:20.333 --> 37:24.233
>> SO, TO ME, REPARATIONS HAS TO

37:24.300 --> 37:25.133
BE THREE-PRONGED.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.166
RECOMMITMENT TO STRONG

37:26.233 --> 37:27.600
ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS

37:27.666 --> 37:28.800
LAWS, BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THIS

37:28.866 --> 37:31.200
ECONOMIC PAYMENT, BUT WE KNOW

37:31.266 --> 37:32.233
THAT BLACK PEOPLE STILL FACE

37:32.300 --> 37:34.133
DISCRIMINATION IN EVERY ASPECT

37:34.200 --> 37:35.000
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.

37:35.066 --> 37:36.533
AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

37:36.600 --> 37:40.566
REALLY LARGE INVESTMENT OF

37:40.633 --> 37:42.000
RESOURCES INTO THE BLACK

37:42.066 --> 37:43.200
COMMUNITY THAT HAVE HAD THAT

37:43.266 --> 37:45.166
WEALTH EXTRACTED AND HAVE BEEN

37:45.233 --> 37:47.533
DENIED THE ABILITY TO LIVE LIKE

37:47.600 --> 37:48.166
OTHER AMERICANS.

37:48.233 --> 37:52.033
AND I THINK ANYONE WHO IS

37:52.100 --> 37:54.033
REPARATIONS THAT IS NOT GOING

37:54.100 --> 37:56.766
FOR A CASH PAYMENT IS BASICALLY

37:56.833 --> 37:57.033
AS RACIST.

37:57.100 --> 37:57.966
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, IT'S ONLY

37:58.033 --> 37:59.233
WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK FOLKS

37:59.300 --> 38:01.233
THAT WE ARE SO CONCERNED WITH

38:01.300 --> 38:02.766
HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.433
>> DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW HOW

38:04.500 --> 38:06.200
TO SPEND THAT MONEY RESPONSIBLY.

38:06.266 --> 38:08.133
>> I SAY THIS JOKINGLY BUT HALF

38:08.200 --> 38:09.300
JOKINGLY.

38:09.366 --> 38:12.033
IF I WANT TO SPEND MY

38:12.100 --> 38:13.466
REPARATIONS ON ALL GUCCI, THAT

38:13.533 --> 38:16.533
IS MY RIGHT.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.500
>> John: YEAH, BLACK PEOPLE

38:17.566 --> 38:18.033
SHOULD GET TO

38:18.100 --> 38:18.633
DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY

38:18.700 --> 38:19.233
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES

38:19.300 --> 38:20.400
THEM, IN THE SAME WAY WHITE

38:20.466 --> 38:20.966
PEOPLE GOT TO DECIDE HOW TO

38:21.033 --> 38:21.500
SPEND ALL THE BILLIONS OF

38:21.566 --> 38:22.166
DOLLARS IN WEALTH IT CREATED FOR

38:22.233 --> 38:22.533
THEM.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.633
I PROMISE YOU NOT ALL THAT MONEY

38:24.700 --> 38:25.500
HAS BEEN SPENT RESPONSIBLY.

38:25.566 --> 38:26.100
JUST THINK HOW MUCH OF IT HAS

38:26.166 --> 38:26.766
GONE TOWARDS THOMAS KINKADE

38:26.833 --> 38:28.400
PAINTINGS.

38:28.466 --> 38:29.733
THERE IS ONE, AND ONLY ONE, GOOD

38:29.800 --> 38:30.833
REASON TO BUY A THOMAS KINKADE

38:30.900 --> 38:32.633
PAINTING, AND THAT'S TO HELP

38:32.700 --> 38:33.766
CONVINCE THE APPRAISER THAT YOUR

38:33.833 --> 38:35.066
FRIEND'S WHITE HUSBAND REALLY

38:35.133 --> 38:40.366
DOES LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.

38:40.433 --> 38:41.266
THAT IS IT.

38:41.333 --> 38:42.200
AND I'M NOT SAYING MONEY ALONE

38:42.266 --> 38:43.100
IS WHAT'S CALLED FOR HERE.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.166
AS NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES POINTED

38:44.233 --> 38:45.300
OUT, SIMPLY HANDING OUT CASH

38:45.366 --> 38:46.700
WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE

38:46.766 --> 38:48.400
UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS

38:48.466 --> 38:49.766
THAT PRODUCED INEQUALITY IN THE

38:49.833 --> 38:51.733
FIRST PLACE WOULD BE A BIG

38:51.800 --> 38:56.266
MISTAKE.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.333
THIS IS A BOTH/AND SITUATION.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.033
BUT ULTIMATELY, THE ONLY REAL

38:59.100 --> 38:59.666
STRANGE THING ABOUT PAYING

38:59.733 --> 39:01.066
REPARATIONS TO BLACK PEOPLE IS

39:01.133 --> 39:04.233
THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

39:04.300 --> 39:04.833
JUST LIKE IT'S STRANGE THAT IT

39:04.900 --> 39:05.633
HAS TAKEN SO LONG TO GIVE

39:05.700 --> 39:06.466
BRUCE'S BEACH BACK TO THE

39:06.533 --> 39:08.233
BRUCES.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.500
IN BOTH CASES, THE RIGHT THING

39:09.566 --> 39:11.833
TO DO COULDN'T BE CLEARER.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.533
WHEN YOU DEPRIVE SOMEBODY OF

39:13.600 --> 39:14.933
SOMETHING, YOU MAKE IT RIGHT BY

39:15.000 --> 39:17.166
PAYING WHAT YOU OWE.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.466
NOW, FIGURING OUT EXACTLY HOW TO

39:19.533 --> 39:24.366
PAY MIGHT GET COMPLICATED, BUT

39:24.433 --> 39:25.800
REALIZING THAT YOU HAVE TO

39:25.866 --> 39:28.533
SHOULD BE PRETTY SIMPLE.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.000
BECAUSE THIS IS A WOUND THAT WE

39:30.066 --> 39:32.633
ARE ACTIVELY CHOOSING NOT TO

39:32.700 --> 39:33.966
HEAL, AND IT IS HURTING REAL

39:34.033 --> 39:36.366
PEOPLE EVERY DAY.

39:36.433 --> 39:37.366
AND ALSO TRY AND THINK OF THE

39:37.433 --> 39:37.966
POSITIVES HERE.

39:38.033 --> 39:38.666
BECAUSE IF WE DO CHOOSE TO DO

39:38.733 --> 39:39.633
THE RIGHT THING, AND AFTER ALL

39:39.700 --> 39:40.600
THESE YEARS, REDRESS THIS WRONG,

39:40.666 --> 39:43.100
WE MIGHT FINALLY LIVE UP TO THIS

39:43.166 --> 39:47.066
COUNTRY'S HIGHEST POTENTIAL, AND

39:47.133 --> 39:49.133
THAT IS TO BECOME A NATION OF

39:49.200 --> 39:53.233
ROSE AND ANGIES GETTING

39:53.300 --> 39:54.133
ABSOLUTELY DAY-WASTED ON

39:54.200 --> 39:55.033
OUR PORCHES.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.733
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.
