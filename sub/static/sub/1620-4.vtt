02:41.161 --> 02:44.331
The little lord's
been dreaming again.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.424
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.094
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

02:57.219 --> 03:00.222
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.809
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.854
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.772
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

03:08.856 --> 03:11.900
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.070
Hodor!

03:18.740 --> 03:21.660
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.787
Hodor.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.338
I must say I received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.049
Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.760
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

03:38.844 --> 03:41.138
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.348
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.727
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.689
So it's true.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.860
Hello, Bran.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.237
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.781
He has no memory of that day.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.451
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

04:03.535 --> 04:06.622
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

04:06.705 --> 04:10.209
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.589
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.798
Well, I mean I did like to.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.385
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

04:20.511 --> 04:22.711
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.641
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.726
My father will rejoice to hear it.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.103
I have a gift for you.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.106
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.528
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.990
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

04:42.741 --> 04:46.078
- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.372
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.750
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

04:51.875 --> 04:56.380
I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.633
You've done my brother a kindness.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.718
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

05:01.844 --> 05:06.932
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.893
There I'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.651
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

05:17.734 --> 05:20.279
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.323
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.701
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.912
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.250
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

05:33.375 --> 05:36.128
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

05:36.170 --> 05:38.005
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

05:38.088 --> 05:40.632
M'lady?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.552
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.638
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

05:46.763 --> 05:50.684
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

05:50.767 --> 05:54.688
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.483
- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.778
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

06:01.862 --> 06:06.408
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.786
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.291
I suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.711
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.671
- Careful, Imp.
- I've offended you.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.008
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.011
Anyway, don't despair.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.305
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

06:28.388 --> 06:30.682
and I've learned to live with it.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.602
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.772
I'll try not to wear her out.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.029
Shoulder, legs.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.995
Leg, shoulder, leg.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.998
Left foot forward. Good.

06:55.123 --> 06:59.127
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.630
What in seven hells is that?

07:02.589 --> 07:06.260
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.303
Tell them your name.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.389
Samwell Tarly,

07:10.430 --> 07:14.393
of Horn Hill...
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.103
I've come to take the black.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.856
Come to take the black pudding.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.859
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.902
Rast...

07:23.986 --> 07:26.029
see what he can do.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.789
I yield.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.458
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.711
Pick up your sword.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.463
Hit him till he finds his feet.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.517
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.353
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.772
Again, harder.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.359
- I yield!
- Enough!

08:04.526 --> 08:07.404
He yielded.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.033
Looks like the bastard's in love.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.871
All right then, Lord Snow,

08:15.996 --> 08:19.166
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.252
You two. Three of you
ought to be sufficient

08:22.377 --> 08:24.588
to make lady piggy squeal.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.674
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.721
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.987
Yield, yield, yield!
I yield.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.535
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.371
That's all you're good for.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.876
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.717
- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.805
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.934
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

09:19.017 --> 09:22.646
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

09:23.605 --> 09:26.024
I wanted to.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.902
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

09:30.612 --> 09:32.614
I'm a coward.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.785
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.871
You're right. I'm sorry.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.749
I just... wanted to thank you.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.720
A bloody coward.

09:54.845 --> 09:58.932
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.851
You're too stupid to be a coward.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.853
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.856
before summer's over.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.983
Come here!

10:36.303 --> 10:39.723
Hyah, hyah!

10:42.017 --> 10:47.022
Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

10:47.773 --> 10:51.652
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.280
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.773
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,

10:57.783 --> 11:01.578
because they're my people.
This is my army.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.707
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.479
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

11:28.564 --> 11:31.149
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

11:31.275 --> 11:34.069
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.363
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.073
But if they did?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.578
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

11:42.661 --> 11:45.289
but the men
advising him are different.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.751
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

11:49.835 --> 11:51.795
long ago.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.256
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.633
He drove me from my land.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.345
You sold slaves.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.140
Aye.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.020
- Why?
- I had no money

12:08.187 --> 12:10.230
and an expensive wife.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.149
And where is she now?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.484
In another place,

12:14.568 --> 12:16.820
with another man.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.245
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.915
They call you the last dragon...

12:27.998 --> 12:30.626
They do.

12:31.919 --> 12:36.006
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.133
It's entirely possible.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.720
What happened to the dragons?

12:41.803 --> 12:44.890
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

12:48.227 --> 12:51.939
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.483
The brave men rode them.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.986
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

12:58.111 --> 13:00.572
this world has ever seen.

13:00.697 --> 13:05.035
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

13:05.160 --> 13:08.038
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

13:09.039 --> 13:12.125
The swords of the vanquished,

13:12.209 --> 13:14.378
a thousand of them...

13:14.503 --> 13:18.841
melted together
like so many candles.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.931
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.560
There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.229
Really. Why dragons?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.815
They can fly.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.901
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

13:37.985 --> 13:40.487
and they're somewhere else...

13:40.612 --> 13:42.656
far away.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.536
And they can kill.

13:47.619 --> 13:52.749
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

13:52.833 --> 13:56.461
gets burned away to nothing...

13:56.503 --> 13:58.297
...melted...

13:58.463 --> 14:01.216
like so many candles.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.926
Ow.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.891
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.018
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

14:11.101 --> 14:13.729
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.648
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.483
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

14:18.525 --> 14:22.487
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.489
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

14:24.531 --> 14:29.286
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.998
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

14:33.123 --> 14:37.586
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.881
So...

14:41.965 --> 14:44.468
have you seen one?

14:44.593 --> 14:47.638
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.641
No.

14:50.724 --> 14:54.269
No, the last one died
many years before I was born.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.439
I'll tell you what I have seen -

14:58.440 --> 15:00.734
their skulls.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.820
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.440
When I was very young,
just three or four,

15:05.447 --> 15:07.991
my father used
to walk me down the rows

15:08.075 --> 15:10.369
and I'd recite
their names for him.

15:10.494 --> 15:14.164
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.167
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

15:17.292 --> 15:21.839
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

15:23.298 --> 15:27.469
But... but as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

15:28.762 --> 15:30.848
they got bigger

15:30.973 --> 15:33.976
and bigger and bigger.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.273
There was Ghiscar

15:39.356 --> 15:41.859
and Valryon,

15:41.942 --> 15:43.735
Vermithrax,

15:43.777 --> 15:46.029
Essovius...

15:46.113 --> 15:48.574
...Archonei,

15:48.699 --> 15:51.994
Meraxes,

15:53.161 --> 15:55.038
Vhagar...

15:56.790 --> 15:59.793
and Balerion the Dread...

15:59.835 --> 16:04.965
...whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

16:05.048 --> 16:07.134
into one.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.974
What happened to the skulls?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.561
I don't know.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.939
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.901
Scattered to the wind.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.824
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.245
What did I buy you for?

16:35.370 --> 16:38.540
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.920
To, uh, teach your sister.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.048
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

16:46.173 --> 16:49.343
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

16:53.889 --> 16:56.767
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.938
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

17:10.739 --> 17:15.993
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

17:16.578 --> 17:21.583
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

17:21.666 --> 17:26.338
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.549
- What if I have a girl?
- Gods be good,

17:28.674 --> 17:31.593
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.804
What if I only have girls?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.806
I wouldn't worry about that.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.101
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.144
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.605
But what if?

17:43.689 --> 17:47.025
Well, if you only had girls,

17:47.067 --> 17:50.654
I suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.448
And everyone would hate me.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.617
Nobody could ever hate you.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.495
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.998
Why would you say such a thing?

18:02.833 --> 18:04.918
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

18:05.085 --> 18:06.962
I've told you
a hundred times -

18:07.087 --> 18:09.965
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.218
Do you remember your lessons?

18:15.804 --> 18:20.017
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

18:20.142 --> 18:23.687
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.606
And how many years
did it take to build...

18:25.731 --> 18:30.027
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

18:30.194 --> 18:33.405
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

18:33.572 --> 18:37.784
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.621
Why were they killed?

18:41.455 --> 18:44.249
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.460
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.713
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

18:49.796 --> 18:53.467
- to forgive your father.
- No, I won't.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.979
It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

18:57.054 --> 19:02.309
The King's Tournament.
I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.436
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

19:04.561 --> 19:07.689
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.651
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

19:10.776 --> 19:13.737
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.532
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

19:16.615 --> 19:19.660
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.370
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

19:21.537 --> 19:24.373
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

19:24.456 --> 19:27.918
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

19:30.254 --> 19:31.964
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

19:32.047 --> 19:35.467
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.345
They will be put to good use.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.473
The sooner this is over, the better.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.309
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

19:44.434 --> 19:48.564
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.441
And every inn
in the city is full

19:51.525 --> 19:53.443
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.946
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.532
- Hmm.
- Now...

19:58.615 --> 20:01.076
if there's nothing else, my lords?

20:10.752 --> 20:12.880
Oh, this heat.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.799
On days like this,
I envy you northerners,

20:15.883 --> 20:18.719
your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.513
I've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.308
Lord Arryn?

20:24.433 --> 20:28.979
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

20:29.062 --> 20:34.109
I took personal charge of his care,
but I could not save him.

20:34.276 --> 20:39.990
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

20:40.908 --> 20:44.620
I saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

20:44.703 --> 20:49.583
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

20:51.502 --> 20:54.379
I have been grand maester
for many years.

20:54.546 --> 20:57.591
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

20:57.674 --> 21:00.594
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

21:00.636 --> 21:03.055
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

21:03.222 --> 21:06.433
A book? What book?

21:06.600 --> 21:10.938
Oh, I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

21:11.063 --> 21:13.565
A... A ponderous tome.

21:13.649 --> 21:17.110
No, I'd like to read it.

21:19.655 --> 21:22.533
The Lineages and Histories

21:22.699 --> 21:25.827
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

21:25.911 --> 21:28.956
with descriptions
of many high lords

21:29.039 --> 21:32.084
and noble ladies

21:32.167 --> 21:34.253
and their children.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.897
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

21:54.064 --> 21:57.693
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

21:57.734 --> 22:00.362
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

22:00.487 --> 22:03.699
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

22:03.782 --> 22:07.160
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

22:07.327 --> 22:09.496
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

22:09.621 --> 22:13.292
As I said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.003
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

22:16.128 --> 22:18.922
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.258
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.802
...did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

22:23.844 --> 22:25.804
Nothing of import, my lord.

22:25.846 --> 22:30.559
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.979
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.315
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.692
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

22:38.859 --> 22:42.446
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.615
For all the weight they're given,

22:44.698 --> 22:48.452
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.580
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.707
What else could it be?

22:54.708 --> 22:58.879
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.256
No, no, no, I don't think it likely.

23:01.340 --> 23:05.844
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

23:05.969 --> 23:08.639
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

23:08.764 --> 23:13.101
Yes, women, cravens...

23:13.227 --> 23:14.937
and eunuchs.

23:15.896 --> 23:19.191
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

23:19.316 --> 23:23.487
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.323
How that sort of person
found himself

23:26.406 --> 23:30.452
- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.

23:30.536 --> 23:33.497
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.165
Thank you.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.292
I'll find my own way out.

23:59.690 --> 24:04.152
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.154
It's a hard fall down these steps.

24:06.238 --> 24:10.534
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

24:11.910 --> 24:16.290
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.750
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.837
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

24:21.920 --> 24:26.008
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

24:26.133 --> 24:30.220
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

24:32.097 --> 24:35.684
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.895
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

24:38.020 --> 24:42.191
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

24:44.026 --> 24:48.363
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

24:48.447 --> 24:51.408
or sit on the king's council.

24:51.533 --> 24:56.288
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.667
Can I be lord of a holdfast?

25:03.003 --> 25:07.716
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

25:07.799 --> 25:12.930
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

25:14.473 --> 25:17.017
- Hmm?
- No.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.062
That's not me.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.670
Hello.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.757
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.053
I should warn you,

25:53.136 --> 25:55.556
I don't see all that well.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.559
Come stand by the fire.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.812
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

26:01.937 --> 26:04.606
You're not. You're freezing.

26:16.785 --> 26:19.413
I don't like high places.

26:19.454 --> 26:23.375
You can't fight. You can't see.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.879
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

26:28.338 --> 26:29.923
What are you doing here, Sam?

26:34.511 --> 26:38.182
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

26:39.057 --> 26:42.686
"You're almost a man now," he said.

26:42.811 --> 26:47.024
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

26:47.107 --> 26:49.651
"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

26:49.735 --> 26:53.155
"forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

26:54.114 --> 26:57.534
"If you do not," he said,

26:58.535 --> 27:00.996
"then we'll have a hunt

27:01.121 --> 27:04.208
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

27:04.291 --> 27:07.127
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

27:09.254 --> 27:11.340
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.842
"Nothing would please me more."

27:19.139 --> 27:23.602
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

27:23.644 --> 27:25.604
Yes, he is.

27:26.522 --> 27:28.232
I'm not going to get
any better, you know.

27:29.775 --> 27:31.610
Well...

27:31.652 --> 27:33.403
you can't get any worse.

27:43.622 --> 27:46.333
I hear you're reading a boring book.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.168
Hmph.

27:48.293 --> 27:51.964
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.424
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

27:55.384 --> 27:57.010
Not surprising.

27:57.135 --> 28:01.682
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

28:01.765 --> 28:05.978
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

28:06.061 --> 28:08.105
Knighted for what?

28:09.523 --> 28:12.734
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

28:12.818 --> 28:15.070
Where is Ser Hugh?

28:15.153 --> 28:17.865
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.450
Do you see that boy there?

28:20.576 --> 28:23.120
One of Varys's little birds.

28:23.245 --> 28:26.832
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.834
Now look there.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.837
That one belongs to the queen.

28:31.879 --> 28:36.133
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

28:36.258 --> 28:40.345
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

28:42.222 --> 28:46.185
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

28:47.519 --> 28:50.814
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

28:51.857 --> 28:56.153
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

28:56.278 --> 28:58.822
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

28:58.947 --> 29:02.951
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armourer in the city.

29:03.035 --> 29:05.913
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

29:05.996 --> 29:08.415
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

29:08.540 --> 29:10.876
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

29:10.959 --> 29:15.047
visit this armourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

29:16.632 --> 29:19.510
Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.

29:19.593 --> 29:24.014
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

29:30.729 --> 29:33.690
. .22, 23,

29:33.857 --> 29:37.611
24, 5, 6, 2T,

29:37.736 --> 29:39.446
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

29:39.571 --> 29:41.573
30, 31, 32...

29:41.698 --> 29:43.909
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

29:44.034 --> 29:49.164
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

29:49.289 --> 29:52.793
- I'm the captain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

29:52.918 --> 29:56.046
- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.

29:56.088 --> 29:58.799
Well, it just so happens that I am.

30:03.637 --> 30:06.890
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

30:07.015 --> 30:10.185
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

30:10.310 --> 30:13.772
They strut around
like roosters down here.

30:13.856 --> 30:16.775
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.610
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

30:18.735 --> 30:23.156
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.411
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.497
I regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

30:30.622 --> 30:35.043
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

30:35.169 --> 30:39.298
- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.300
Gendry!

30:44.887 --> 30:46.388
Here he is.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.474
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

30:50.309 --> 30:52.436
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.994
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.038
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

31:11.163 --> 31:14.541
- If his Lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

31:14.666 --> 31:18.337
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

31:18.420 --> 31:21.965
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

31:22.090 --> 31:23.967
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

31:24.092 --> 31:26.094
What kind of questions?

31:28.347 --> 31:31.225
About my work at first,

31:31.350 --> 31:34.394
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

31:36.438 --> 31:39.358
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

31:39.483 --> 31:42.945
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

31:43.028 --> 31:45.405
What did you tell him?

31:46.865 --> 31:49.576
She died when I was little.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.537
She had yellow hair.

31:52.246 --> 31:54.790
She'd sing to me sometimes.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.795
Look at me.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.473
Get back to work, lad.

32:13.684 --> 32:17.604
If the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

32:18.647 --> 32:21.108
you send him to me.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.572
Find anything?

32:27.781 --> 32:29.825
King Robert's bastard son.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.539
He likes that.

32:37.082 --> 32:40.002
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

32:40.085 --> 32:42.171
Should I leave it with...

32:42.296 --> 32:45.883
Shhh. Listen.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.552
Do you hear them?

32:50.721 --> 32:54.391
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

32:55.309 --> 32:56.935
- Guess.
- Three.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.104
Four.

33:00.898 --> 33:03.442
He likes to do this when I'm on duty.

33:03.525 --> 33:05.611
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.609
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?

33:13.619 --> 33:15.037
Have you wronged me?

33:16.872 --> 33:21.335
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

33:21.793 --> 33:25.088
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

33:25.172 --> 33:26.924
Ah.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.967
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

33:29.051 --> 33:32.262
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

33:32.387 --> 33:35.182
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.601
They stopped liking it at the end.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.896
That was a proper battle.

33:41.021 --> 33:44.233
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

33:44.358 --> 33:48.362
With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.

33:48.529 --> 33:51.657
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

33:51.698 --> 33:54.409
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

33:54.576 --> 33:57.871
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.

34:02.584 --> 34:05.295
I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

34:05.420 --> 34:08.257
Let me smell it. Come here.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.803
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.097
I don't serve Lord Stark.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.746
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.125
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.085
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.962
Impossible!

34:47.045 --> 34:49.130
That's enough.

34:55.344 --> 34:58.265
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

34:58.390 --> 35:01.894
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

35:01.977 --> 35:04.438
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

35:04.521 --> 35:07.274
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.860
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

35:09.902 --> 35:13.488
You are in love, Lord Snow.

35:14.865 --> 35:17.868
You girls can do as you please.

35:17.951 --> 35:20.704
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

35:20.871 --> 35:22.873
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

35:45.938 --> 35:48.649
No one touches Sam.

36:02.996 --> 36:05.165
What are you waiting for?

36:14.842 --> 36:16.134
Attack him!

36:26.520 --> 36:28.647
You get in there.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.070
Hit me.

36:36.446 --> 36:38.407
Go on, hit me!

36:40.617 --> 36:42.995
I yield!

36:43.120 --> 36:44.955
Yield. Yield.

36:45.122 --> 36:47.207
I yield.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.546
You think this is funny, do you?

36:56.258 --> 37:00.971
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

37:01.096 --> 37:02.806
do you want a man at your back?

37:02.931 --> 37:05.267
Or a snivelling boy?

37:19.531 --> 37:22.326
You send this whore
to give me commands?

37:22.409 --> 37:25.078
I should have sent you back her head!

37:25.162 --> 37:27.414
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

37:27.539 --> 37:30.542
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.836
Yes, Khaleesi.

37:35.297 --> 37:38.050
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

37:38.175 --> 37:41.929
- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.639
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

37:43.722 --> 37:45.891
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

37:45.974 --> 37:48.602
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

37:48.769 --> 37:50.562
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

37:50.646 --> 37:53.106
This stinks of manure. All of it.

37:53.232 --> 37:55.108
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

37:55.234 --> 37:57.694
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

37:57.778 --> 38:00.447
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

38:00.531 --> 38:05.285
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

38:06.703 --> 38:11.041
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

38:16.880 --> 38:20.384
I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

38:20.425 --> 38:25.514
I am the wife of the great khal
and I carry his son inside me.

38:25.597 --> 38:29.393
The next time you raise a hand to me

38:29.476 --> 38:32.563
will be the last time you have hands.

38:40.404 --> 38:43.740
I know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

38:43.824 --> 38:46.243
I wouldn't doubt it.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.537
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

38:48.662 --> 38:53.750
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

38:53.876 --> 38:56.253
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

38:56.378 --> 38:59.715
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

39:00.507 --> 39:04.469
- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.264
Why not?

39:07.431 --> 39:09.183
Because I'm fat?

39:09.308 --> 39:12.686
- No.
- But I like girls just as much as you do.

39:14.021 --> 39:16.440
They might not like me as much.

39:18.525 --> 39:21.612
I've never... been with one.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.532
You've probably had hundreds.

39:25.574 --> 39:26.575
No.

39:28.911 --> 39:30.662
As a matter of fact,

39:31.622 --> 39:33.332
I'm the same as you.

39:33.498 --> 39:35.459
Yeah. Yeah, I...

39:35.626 --> 39:37.294
I find that hard to believe.

39:37.419 --> 39:39.922
I came very close once.

39:40.005 --> 39:43.133
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

39:44.134 --> 39:47.554
- Didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.515
Was she...

39:49.640 --> 39:51.725
old and ugly?

39:52.684 --> 39:54.478
Young and gorgeous.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.898
A whore named Ros.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.027
What colour hair?

40:02.194 --> 40:04.863
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

40:05.948 --> 40:07.824
And her, um...

40:07.991 --> 40:09.701
Her...

40:10.118 --> 40:12.329
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

40:12.412 --> 40:14.164
- Better.
- Oh, no.

40:15.958 --> 40:21.338
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

40:23.257 --> 40:26.844
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

40:27.636 --> 40:29.930
And why is my surname Snow?

40:31.014 --> 40:32.933
Because...

40:33.058 --> 40:35.394
you're a bastard from the North.

40:37.271 --> 40:39.815
I never met my mother.

40:39.898 --> 40:42.609
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

40:42.693 --> 40:44.820
I don't know if she's living or dead.

40:47.239 --> 40:51.326
I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

40:53.245 --> 40:55.205
or a whore.

40:57.332 --> 40:59.751
So I sat there

40:59.835 --> 41:03.046
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

41:04.339 --> 41:06.675
But I couldn't do it.

41:07.509 --> 41:12.181
Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant

41:12.264 --> 41:17.311
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

41:21.857 --> 41:24.735
It's not a good life for a child.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.945
Ah, mmm.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.200
So...

41:32.034 --> 41:33.994
you didn't know where to put it?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.835
Enjoying yourselves?

41:43.879 --> 41:45.797
You look cold, boys.

41:45.923 --> 41:48.800
It is a bit nippy.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.720
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

41:51.887 --> 41:53.805
indoors.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.599
It's still summer.

41:56.558 --> 41:59.478
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

42:00.354 --> 42:03.440
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

42:04.399 --> 42:06.068
I remember.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.612
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

42:08.695 --> 42:10.697
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

42:10.822 --> 42:14.117
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

42:14.243 --> 42:17.079
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

42:18.372 --> 42:21.250
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

42:21.375 --> 42:24.127
during the last winter.

42:24.211 --> 42:28.131
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

42:28.215 --> 42:31.468
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

42:31.552 --> 42:34.388
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

42:34.513 --> 42:37.140
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

42:37.224 --> 42:40.769
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

42:40.894 --> 42:43.021
Harder than you'll ever be.

42:43.105 --> 42:45.607
They know their country
better than we do.

42:45.691 --> 42:48.193
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

42:49.236 --> 42:52.781
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

42:53.949 --> 42:56.368
And we got caught in the open.

42:56.493 --> 42:58.245
Wind so strong

42:58.412 --> 43:02.416
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.294
If you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

43:05.377 --> 43:08.463
you lost a finger to the frost.

43:08.547 --> 43:10.382
And all in darkness.

43:13.719 --> 43:16.096
You don't know cold.

43:16.221 --> 43:18.098
Neither of you do.

43:20.726 --> 43:22.936
The horses died first.

43:25.272 --> 43:28.650
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

43:30.527 --> 43:32.946
Eating the horses was easy.

43:35.115 --> 43:37.993
But later when we started to fall...

43:39.786 --> 43:41.830
That wasn't easy.

43:43.207 --> 43:46.793
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

43:51.590 --> 43:54.051
Soft, fat boys like you.

43:54.218 --> 43:59.139
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

44:01.850 --> 44:04.728
Soon we'll have new recruits

44:04.811 --> 44:08.106
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

44:08.273 --> 44:10.192
for assignment,

44:10.317 --> 44:14.780
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

44:14.863 --> 44:16.490
but you'd be fools to believe it.

44:18.242 --> 44:20.077
You're boys still.

44:20.244 --> 44:23.789
And come the winter you will die...

44:25.290 --> 44:27.334
like flies.

44:33.590 --> 44:35.926
I hit him.

44:36.051 --> 44:37.427
I hit the dragon.

44:37.511 --> 44:39.805
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

44:39.888 --> 44:42.516
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

44:42.558 --> 44:46.687
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

44:46.854 --> 44:50.816
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

44:50.899 --> 44:52.401
No.

44:53.110 --> 44:55.529
But the common people
are waiting for him.

44:55.571 --> 44:59.908
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

45:00.033 --> 45:04.705
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

45:04.788 --> 45:08.083
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.878
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

45:14.590 --> 45:16.258
Home.

45:17.509 --> 45:19.595
I pray for home too.

45:23.223 --> 45:26.101
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

45:27.811 --> 45:31.648
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.862
He'll never take us home.

45:56.798 --> 45:58.967
Lovers' quarrel?

45:59.051 --> 46:00.552
I'm sorry. Do I...?

46:00.636 --> 46:03.055
Sansa dear
this is Lord Baelish.

46:03.180 --> 46:05.307
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

46:06.183 --> 46:08.352
I've known your mother a long, long time.

46:08.477 --> 46:10.646
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

46:10.687 --> 46:13.565
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

46:14.650 --> 46:17.778
When I was a child, I was very small,

46:17.861 --> 46:20.062
and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

46:20.072 --> 46:24.243
SO you See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

46:24.368 --> 46:27.037
I've been sitting here for days!

46:27.162 --> 46:30.707
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

46:38.465 --> 46:41.051
Gods, who's that?

46:41.176 --> 46:43.554
Ser Gregor Clegane.

46:43.679 --> 46:46.557
They call him the Mountain.

46:48.141 --> 46:50.853
The Hound's older brother.

46:50.936 --> 46:54.106
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

46:54.231 --> 46:56.066
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

46:56.191 --> 46:57.776
Look how far he's come.

46:57.860 --> 47:02.114
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

48:22.069 --> 48:24.112
Not what you were expecting?

48:27.616 --> 48:31.245
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

48:32.704 --> 48:35.040
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.670
The Hound was just a pup,

48:39.795 --> 48:41.964
six years old maybe.

48:42.089 --> 48:44.091
Gregor a few years older,

48:44.174 --> 48:47.970
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

48:48.053 --> 48:53.976
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

48:54.101 --> 49:00.190
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

49:00.315 --> 49:02.609
Gregor's toy,

49:02.693 --> 49:05.362
a wooden knight.

49:05.487 --> 49:07.364
Gregor never said a word,

49:07.489 --> 49:10.450
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

49:10.534 --> 49:13.871
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

49:13.996 --> 49:17.624
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

49:17.708 --> 49:19.877
while his face melted.

49:24.423 --> 49:28.051
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

49:28.135 --> 49:31.722
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.

49:31.805 --> 49:35.100
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

49:35.225 --> 49:39.521
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

49:52.159 --> 49:55.370
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

49:58.498 --> 50:01.168
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

50:01.293 --> 50:04.463
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

50:05.964 --> 50:09.384
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us,

50:09.468 --> 50:12.137
the ugliness with the wolves.

50:13.472 --> 50:15.933
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

50:17.226 --> 50:20.729
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

50:21.980 --> 50:23.732
How is Sansa?

50:24.650 --> 50:27.736
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

50:28.695 --> 50:31.782
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

50:31.865 --> 50:35.577
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.788
What is it you hope to accomplish?

50:37.913 --> 50:40.749
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

50:40.874 --> 50:43.252
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

50:43.335 --> 50:46.004
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

50:46.171 --> 50:48.757
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

50:48.882 --> 50:51.635
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.388
If that's my job, then so be it.

50:55.973 --> 50:58.350
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

50:58.433 --> 51:02.062
You take your orders
and you carry on.

51:02.229 --> 51:04.106
I suppose it makes sense.

51:04.273 --> 51:07.276
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

51:07.401 --> 51:10.487
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

51:14.241 --> 51:16.243
As was I.

51:34.344 --> 51:36.138
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

51:37.055 --> 51:38.056
And to you.

51:38.182 --> 51:40.350
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

51:40.475 --> 51:42.853
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.

51:42.978 --> 51:46.565
- A song while we wait or...?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

51:46.648 --> 51:50.235
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

51:50.402 --> 51:53.405
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

51:55.490 --> 51:57.034
Gods.

51:57.159 --> 51:58.702
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

51:58.785 --> 52:01.663
- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.

52:01.747 --> 52:04.875
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.963
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...

52:10.088 --> 52:12.466
...to remedy this?

52:12.591 --> 52:15.844
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

52:17.471 --> 52:20.182
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

52:20.265 --> 52:22.226
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

52:22.309 --> 52:24.895
Might I entertain you while you eat?

52:24.978 --> 52:27.773
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

52:27.898 --> 52:31.527
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

52:31.610 --> 52:35.781
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

52:36.448 --> 52:39.243
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

52:39.368 --> 52:41.161
Lady Stark!

52:49.086 --> 52:53.799
I was still Catelyn Tully
the last time I stayed here.

52:56.176 --> 52:58.387
You, ser.

52:59.179 --> 53:03.600
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

53:03.725 --> 53:05.185
It is, my lady.

53:05.310 --> 53:07.980
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

53:08.063 --> 53:12.109
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

53:12.234 --> 53:13.777
She is.

53:15.904 --> 53:19.324
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

53:19.449 --> 53:24.746
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

53:24.830 --> 53:27.416
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

53:27.541 --> 53:30.460
I envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

53:30.586 --> 53:34.089
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

53:35.549 --> 53:37.551
I know your sigil as well -

53:38.844 --> 53:41.471
the twin towers of Frey.

53:41.597 --> 53:43.765
How fares your lord, ser?

53:44.433 --> 53:46.268
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

53:46.351 --> 53:49.980
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

53:50.105 --> 53:52.274
- He plans to take another wife.
- Ha!

53:59.239 --> 54:00.866
This man...

54:00.949 --> 54:03.952
came into my house as a guest

54:03.994 --> 54:07.956
and there conspired
to murder my son.

54:08.832 --> 54:11.293
A boy of 10.

54:13.045 --> 54:16.215
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

54:16.381 --> 54:19.134
I call upon you to seize him

54:19.927 --> 54:22.638
and help me return him to Winterfell

54:22.804 --> 54:25.098
to await the king's justice.

54:31.804 --> 54:36.164
