He was a convenience store owner.

a crushed larynx

a lefort fracture?

02:27.045 --> 02:29.712
It's a bilateral
horizontal facial injury.

02:29.780 --> 02:30.780
Looks like there was also

02:30.801 --> 02:32.282
a blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.778
So they were blitz attacked
to gain control,

10:56.407 --> 11:02.644
After my dad died,
he locked onto me.

11:02.711 --> 11:07.249
And he manipulated me into
compliant victimization.

11:07.317 --> 11:08.917
Now, you remember how I
told you that I got into it

11:08.985 --> 11:10.585
with that local gangbanger
when I was younger.

11:10.653 --> 11:12.354
Well, somehow Buford
got it all expunged.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.482
Now, I didn't understand why

11:13.507 --> 11:15.166
a guy who barely knew me
would do that.

11:18.327 --> 11:21.528
Buford gave me his time.

11:21.596 --> 11:25.933
He taught me
how to play football.

11:26.001 --> 11:29.971
And then he took me
to his cabin on the lake.

11:30.038 --> 11:31.772
I was a kid.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.539
I was a kid
from the Southside.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.442
I'd never been to a cabin,
much less a lake.

11:35.509 --> 11:38.078
Morgan, you don't
have to do this.

11:38.145 --> 11:40.380
They need to know, Hotch.

11:40.448 --> 11:43.683
They need to know
this guy's M.O.

11:48.356 --> 11:52.557
Buford built up my trust.

11:52.625 --> 11:55.961
And then he would lower
my inhibition with Helgeson wine.

11:56.029 --> 11:58.464
He called it his Jesus juice.

12:01.034 --> 12:03.802
Then he would molest me.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.070
And every time he would see
that dead look in my eyes

12:06.138 --> 12:08.606
that said
I wanted him to stop...

12:11.143 --> 12:14.912
He would just say,
"You better man up, boy."

12:16.815 --> 12:19.217
"Look up to the sky."

12:21.052 --> 12:24.587
Did you ever tell anyone
about that phrase?

12:24.655 --> 12:27.157
No.

12:27.225 --> 12:31.728
We're probably looking at someone
who Buford abused.

12:31.795 --> 12:32.996
The victim could harbor
a great deal of anger

12:33.064 --> 12:34.764
if he didn't deal with
his own abuse.

12:34.832 --> 12:37.199
And with the right trigger, it could
develop into this kind of rage.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.434
Where's Buford now?

12:38.502 --> 12:40.269
We got him locked up
for homicide in 2006,

12:40.337 --> 12:42.271
but because of
the statute of limitations,

12:42.339 --> 12:44.273
we never got him
for molestation.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.608
Buford ran the community
center for years.

12:46.676 --> 12:48.511
An offender like him could
have hundreds of victims.

12:48.578 --> 12:49.945
All right, let's talk
about victimology.

12:50.013 --> 12:52.481
Each of these men had
had interactions with kids

12:52.549 --> 12:53.614
right before
they were killed.

12:53.682 --> 12:55.616
The killer switched
from white victims

12:55.684 --> 12:57.285
to African-Americans.

12:57.353 --> 12:59.054
You'd think that if they
were surrogates for Buford,

12:59.121 --> 13:00.621
he'd kill only
black men.

13:00.689 --> 13:01.688
[Ring]
Hello?

13:01.756 --> 13:03.157
Garcia, I need you
to compile a list

13:03.224 --> 13:05.526
of all of the boys who played
football at the community center

13:05.593 --> 13:06.960
20-30 years ago.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.662
Ok.

13:14.635 --> 13:17.470
I knew about Buford
molesting Morgan,

13:17.538 --> 13:18.904
but there were more kids?

13:18.972 --> 13:22.641
Preferential offenders
typically have dozens of victims.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.743
And each reacts differently.

13:24.811 --> 13:28.214
Morgan became an FBI agent
and this one went the other way.

13:28.282 --> 13:30.083
You know, had I known
back in the day

13:30.150 --> 13:31.484
that Morgan was going
through all this,

13:31.552 --> 13:34.286
I wouldn't have arrested
him 6 years ago.

13:34.353 --> 13:36.955
And I sure wouldn't have been
so hard on him as a kid.

13:37.022 --> 13:38.756
I know.

13:38.824 --> 13:40.125
Let us go deliver
the profile

13:40.193 --> 13:42.827
and stop this guy
from killing anybody else.

13:42.895 --> 13:45.363
The man that we're looking for is
an African-American male

13:45.431 --> 13:47.999
in his late 30s to early 40s,
and he's from this area.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.601
He most likely attended the local
community center as a youth.

13:50.668 --> 13:52.436
He's athletic
and he's powerful,

13:52.504 --> 13:55.906
which explains his ability
to overcome his victims with aggression.

13:55.974 --> 13:57.774
Blake: His perfect
timing and selection

13:57.842 --> 14:00.010
say his intelligence
level is high,

14:00.078 --> 14:02.480
and his victim selection
shows us his murders

14:02.547 --> 14:03.981
are not planned
in advance.

14:04.048 --> 14:05.715
Rossi: He may have
a drinking problem,

14:05.782 --> 14:08.184
which makes him more
unpredictable

14:08.252 --> 14:09.292
and exacerbates his anger.

14:09.353 --> 14:13.022
Come on, now,
I'm his father!

14:13.090 --> 14:15.091
The fact that he doesn't
steal from his victims

14:15.159 --> 14:17.994
shows us that
he's mission oriented.

14:18.061 --> 14:20.763
Morgan: This says that the
substance abuse is a coping mechanism,

14:20.831 --> 14:23.798
from the fact that he never adequately
dealt with his own victimization.

14:23.866 --> 14:26.235
By exposing his victims
and scrawling the phrase

14:26.302 --> 14:29.037
Buford used during his sexual assaults
at the crime scenes,

14:29.105 --> 14:32.407
he's telling the world
that he sees the victims

14:32.475 --> 14:35.511
as child molesters, which is
his justification for killing them.

14:35.578 --> 14:38.078
This is an example
of projection and polarization,

14:38.147 --> 14:41.449
a black-and-white thinking which
when coupled with impulsivity, anger,

14:41.517 --> 14:43.017
and outbursts of violence
indicates

14:43.084 --> 14:45.520
that this unsub's most likely
suffering from an extreme case

14:45.587 --> 14:47.221
of borderline personality
disorder.

14:47.289 --> 14:50.924
BPD is one of the most common
mental disorders suffered by adults

14:50.992 --> 14:52.527
who were victimized
as children.

14:52.594 --> 14:55.662
This represents the borderline
between anxiety and psychosis.

14:57.031 --> 14:59.232
We believe this unsub's perspective
has become so warped

14:59.267 --> 15:02.335
that he's likely experiencing
stress-related paranoid ideation,

15:02.403 --> 15:03.990
most likely brought on
by a recent traumatic event

15:04.015 --> 15:05.639
that triggered that rage.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.307
No!

15:07.375 --> 15:09.708
He's killing men just after they
innocently interact with children.

15:09.776 --> 15:14.647
So step up patrols in parks, schools,
ball fields, even family events.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.682
But do not try to
confront this man alone.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.485
We believe that he is armed
and extremely dangerous.

15:19.553 --> 15:20.752
Thank you.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.189
[Cell phone rings]

15:23.256 --> 15:24.456
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.725
I'm gonna start with the good
news first 'cause I wanna.

15:26.758 --> 15:29.627
The renamed Damien Walters
community center is thriving

15:29.695 --> 15:31.663
under its new director,
Ms. Walters, Damien's mom.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.199
The bad news is, although
they now computerize their records,

15:34.266 --> 15:35.264
back when Buford ran the joint

15:35.289 --> 15:37.209
it was all paper files,
so I'm out of luck there.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.003
All right, thanks, Garcia.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.572
JJ, why don't you get Reid

15:40.639 --> 15:42.573
and go over to the center,
dive into those files,

15:42.640 --> 15:44.174
see if you can come up
with a comprehensive list

15:44.242 --> 15:45.576
of Buford's potential victims.

15:45.643 --> 15:47.244
I actually know
one of them personally.

15:47.312 --> 15:48.679
His name is James Barfield.

15:48.746 --> 15:50.080
He's a senior
at Northwestern.

15:50.147 --> 15:52.015
I might be able to get
something out of him.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.584
Ok. You and Blake
go over there,

15:53.651 --> 15:55.419
see what
you can find out.

15:59.323 --> 16:01.190
Derek Morgan just called
to give me a heads-up.

16:01.258 --> 16:02.491
The records
are in the back.

16:02.559 --> 16:03.492
Reid: Thanks.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.760
You know,
community centers

16:04.828 --> 16:06.195
are supposed to bring
people together,

16:06.263 --> 16:09.098
but this one has torn
enough people apart.

16:09.165 --> 16:12.268
I'll be up front,
if you need anything.

16:12.336 --> 16:14.102
Thank you.

16:18.541 --> 16:21.309
I hear they're talking
first round, huh?

16:21.377 --> 16:23.111
Oh, snap.

16:23.178 --> 16:25.247
Derek Morgan.

16:25.314 --> 16:28.116
That's right.

16:29.484 --> 16:31.518
What are you doing here,
Derek?

16:31.586 --> 16:33.920
Mr. FBI ain't come
to wish me luck.

16:33.988 --> 16:35.623
Carl Buford.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.358
Hey, man, you need
to leave that alone.

16:37.425 --> 16:39.059
Someone's killing men
in our old neighborhood.

16:39.127 --> 16:40.894
What else is new?

16:40.962 --> 16:43.564
Well, because of certain evidence
found at the crime scenes,

16:43.632 --> 16:47.400
we believe it's one of
Buford's former victims.

16:47.468 --> 16:49.168
You told her?

16:49.236 --> 16:51.337
James, we just need to figure
out who's doing this.

16:51.405 --> 16:53.406
You should be hitting the pavement
figuring it out,

16:53.474 --> 16:55.408
not wasting time
talking to me.

16:55.476 --> 16:56.909
James, you're not a suspect.

16:56.977 --> 17:00.980
We just need to identify
the other men.

17:01.047 --> 17:04.483
Look, did Buford ever
mention any special guys,

17:04.550 --> 17:05.784
guys closer to my age?

17:05.851 --> 17:06.951
I can't help you.

17:07.019 --> 17:08.185
If we don't
get a list of names,

17:08.253 --> 17:10.188
someone else
could lose their life.

17:10.256 --> 17:11.823
Is that really
what you want?

17:11.891 --> 17:14.125
Let me break this down
for you, J. Crew.

17:14.193 --> 17:16.595
I ain't no snitch.
I'm not telling you

17:16.663 --> 17:18.194
what another man's
gone through.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.930
James, just give us
some names and nobody

17:19.954 --> 17:21.464
has to know about this.

17:21.465 --> 17:25.269
I'm not starting my football career
carrying that mess around.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.872
I'm about to get out
of these streets.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.875
I'm not doing it, Derek.

17:35.045 --> 17:36.736
All right, Dr. Genius,

17:36.761 --> 17:38.515
do you notice anything
I'm not seeing?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.383
Between travel receipts,
letters of recommendation,

17:40.451 --> 17:42.952
and expense reports,
I've compiled a list of several names,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.887
but it's obvious there
are gaps in the records.

17:44.955 --> 17:47.724
Do you think Buford destroyed
some files before he went to prison?

17:47.792 --> 17:50.058
Given the opportunity, most
people in his situation would have.

17:50.126 --> 17:52.361
We should probably
call the team with this.

17:59.502 --> 18:01.870
Hotch, James couldn't
give us any names.

18:01.938 --> 18:03.405
Reid and JJ were only able
to come up with a partial list

18:03.473 --> 18:04.773
from the files
at the community center,

18:04.841 --> 18:06.374
so we'll talk
to those guys, we'll see

18:06.442 --> 18:08.343
if anybody stands out
or if they can fill in the gaps.

18:08.410 --> 18:10.345
It could take days or weeks
to track them down.

18:10.412 --> 18:12.980
I need to go see Buford.

18:13.048 --> 18:16.551
I want you to try something
with JJ first.

18:21.656 --> 18:23.022
All right, Derek,

18:23.090 --> 18:26.192
I just need you to relax.

18:26.260 --> 18:28.528
Just try to remember.

18:28.596 --> 18:30.296
JJ, come on,

18:30.365 --> 18:32.999
I taught you the "You're
in a safe place now" speech.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.001
Well, I should be
pretty damn good at it.

18:36.937 --> 18:38.704
All right.

18:38.772 --> 18:42.207
So I need you
to think back

18:42.275 --> 18:44.377
to the sights
and sounds and smells

18:44.444 --> 18:45.944
of playing football.

18:46.012 --> 18:48.748
[Chuckles]

18:48.815 --> 18:53.051
We were some sweaty, dirty,
smelly kids back then.

18:53.119 --> 18:55.052
All we ever wanted to do

18:55.120 --> 18:58.556
was to get out there
and play the game.

18:58.624 --> 19:00.392
JJ: Was Buford there?

19:00.459 --> 19:02.226
Morgan: Yeah.

19:02.294 --> 19:04.996
Did you notice
any unusual glances

19:05.063 --> 19:07.832
or behavior between him
and any of the other boys?

19:09.067 --> 19:10.401
No.

19:10.468 --> 19:12.202
Buford never took his eyes
off of me.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.372
[Whistle blows] Come on, Derek,
focus, focus.

19:15.440 --> 19:19.810
Did you notice if any of the boys
avoided him subtly?

19:24.916 --> 19:28.851
Good job, d.
That's my boy.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.987
Nothing.

19:33.056 --> 19:35.825
I had always thought
I was the only one.

19:38.128 --> 19:42.497
JJ, this isn't working.
I'm done.

19:43.866 --> 19:46.301
I don't want you
going to see Buford.

19:46.368 --> 19:47.903
Hotch, I can handle it.

19:47.970 --> 19:50.271
Rossi: Another man was
found beaten to death.

19:50.339 --> 19:52.908
Same M.O. 10 blocks
from the last murder.

19:52.975 --> 19:54.108
That's 4 in two weeks.

19:54.176 --> 19:56.745
And take Blake with you.

19:56.813 --> 19:59.613
Hotch, come on.
We gotta do this now.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.449
I finished my counseling
two years ago.

20:01.516 --> 20:03.317
I can do this.

20:06.488 --> 20:08.656
All right,
but I'm coming with you.

20:17.798 --> 20:20.232
Morgan, voice-over:
All these years

20:20.300 --> 20:22.569
I kept my mouth shut.

20:22.636 --> 20:25.772
Carl Buford, my mentor.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.442
Look at you. You'd probably
be dead by now.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.978
Yeah, well, it wasn't
for free, was it?

20:32.045 --> 20:33.946
I pulled you
out of the gutter.

20:34.014 --> 20:36.415
I pulled myself
out of the gutter,

20:36.483 --> 20:38.784
all the way to the FBI.
I did that!

20:38.852 --> 20:43.755
You saying I had nothing to do
with making you who you are?

20:43.823 --> 20:47.025
No, Carl.

20:47.093 --> 20:48.837
Actually, I'm saying
you have everything to do

20:48.862 --> 20:50.371
with making me who I am.

21:14.652 --> 21:16.086
[Buzzer]
Open gate.

21:20.290 --> 21:22.392
Close gate.

21:50.618 --> 21:52.853
Derek Morgan.

21:53.821 --> 21:56.057
Got yourself
a new look, huh?

21:56.124 --> 21:59.193
I'm Mohammed Alam now.

21:59.261 --> 22:01.429
Of all my boys,
you're the last one

22:01.496 --> 22:03.797

36:12.737 --> 36:16.640
You don't want to destroy
his life, too, do you?

36:17.609 --> 36:19.610
Rodney, he loves you.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.745
I do, Dad.

He still needs you.

Rodney...

36:43.499 --> 36:45.700
Put that gun down.

37:41.253 --> 37:43.521
You know, the only reason
I became a cop

37:43.589 --> 37:45.790
was so I could tell
right from wrong.

Get bad off the streets,
only the good was standing.

37:50.428 --> 37:52.096

37:52.163 --> 37:54.664
Not just with you
but with all these kids.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.847
I...made assumptions
about who they were,

37:56.872 --> 37:58.397
why they did what they did.

I let slide.

[Clamor, cameras clicking]

to kill those men?

38:24.394 --> 38:25.660
Clear the way, please.

38:25.728 --> 38:27.295
Is it true that this
is all about Carl Buford?

38:27.363 --> 38:29.531
Why did you do it?
Comment, please!

38:29.598 --> 38:32.167
You don't have to do this.
I got it.

38:32.235 --> 38:34.503
Derek, I got it.

38:40.442 --> 38:44.578
I used to think that, uh,
Carl Buford was a hero.

38:44.646 --> 38:48.115
6 years ago I found out
I was very wrong.

38:51.453 --> 38:54.421
Derek.

39:05.666 --> 39:08.634
It's over.

39:08.702 --> 39:10.402
You did it.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.510
You're saying that's why
Rodney Harris killed those men?

39:18.578 --> 39:20.712
Yes, that's what I said.

39:20.780 --> 39:23.549
So being abused
made him a killer?

39:23.616 --> 39:25.917
No.

39:25.985 --> 39:27.585
No, it did not.

I was also one of
Carl Buford's victims.

Yo, Mohammed,

39:51.909 --> 39:53.943
wasn't "Carl Buford"
your government name?

39:54.011 --> 39:56.746
Victimization does not
cause offending.

39:56.814 --> 40:01.217
Yeah. I don't know
what he's talking about.

40:01.284 --> 40:03.185
I loved that kid.

40:04.687 --> 40:09.258
It can cause
a lot of isolation...

40:12.262 --> 40:16.397
And there can be
anger and rage.

40:17.433 --> 40:21.369
It can cause pain
and suffering...

40:21.437 --> 40:24.539
But you can get through it.

40:24.607 --> 40:27.442
It can make you stronger.

40:27.510 --> 40:30.910
It does not have to
destroy your life.

40:37.785 --> 40:39.386
It can make you fight back.
