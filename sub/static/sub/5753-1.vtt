00:27.111 --> 00:29.028
Sharon!

00:29.613 --> 00:31.447
She's not here.

00:31.615 --> 00:35.493
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

00:35.828 --> 00:37.203
Sharon!

00:37.371 --> 00:40.123
- Sharon!
- She's there.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.502
Sharon!

00:46.255 --> 00:47.964
Honey!

00:51.176 --> 00:52.844
Sharon!

00:54.180 --> 00:56.266
Wait for Mommy!

01:16.036 --> 01:17.287
Sharon!

01:23.669 --> 01:25.086
Wait.

01:36.515 --> 01:38.933
Sharon! Honey!

01:51.531 --> 01:54.534
Oh, my God. Sharon!

01:54.702 --> 02:11.551
Home.

02:11.719 --> 02:13.345
No!

02:20.895 --> 02:23.063
- Home! Home!
- We're going home.

02:23.231 --> 02:25.106
Silent Hill!

02:25.274 --> 02:27.984
- Silent Hill!
- Rose!

02:28.152 --> 02:30.111
- Wake up.
- Hey.

02:30.279 --> 02:32.989
- It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
- It's okay. It's okay.

02:33.157 --> 02:34.699
It's okay.

02:36.077 --> 02:38.620
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

02:38.788 --> 02:41.457
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get there.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.544
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

02:44.711 --> 02:46.337
No.

02:46.922 --> 02:50.132
- She said it again.
- I know.

02:51.761 --> 02:55.931
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- Calm down, baby. It's okay.

02:56.099 --> 02:57.683
- It's okay, baby.
- We're right here.

03:01.813 --> 03:06.233
It's okay.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.445
It's okay, baby.

03:37.558 --> 03:40.602
- Wanna see?
- Sure.

03:40.769 --> 03:43.229
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

03:46.817 --> 03:50.487
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.407
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

04:00.248 --> 04:04.877
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

04:05.670 --> 04:07.838
Do you know where we're going?

04:09.299 --> 04:10.799
No?

04:10.967 --> 04:14.553
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

04:14.721 --> 04:18.015
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

04:18.850 --> 04:21.060
...called Silent Hill.

04:22.646 --> 04:25.023
I don't remember.

04:25.483 --> 04:27.359
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

04:27.526 --> 04:31.363
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

04:40.289 --> 04:42.540
Daddy's not coming?

04:44.543 --> 04:46.629
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

05:26.713 --> 05:29.965
Hey.

05:31.259 --> 05:33.218
Break's over, sweetie.

05:34.095 --> 05:35.679
You awake?

05:36.889 --> 05:38.598
You wanna go?

05:57.286 --> 05:59.829
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

06:03.250 --> 06:05.168
Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.

06:05.627 --> 06:09.130
Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

06:27.734 --> 06:28.984
Oh, no, Rose.

06:36.534 --> 06:37.534
No.

07:50.778 --> 07:52.904
Honey, you're awake?

07:53.072 --> 07:54.281
Long drive.

07:54.448 --> 07:56.826
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

07:59.204 --> 08:01.664
Why did you change your pictures?

08:04.209 --> 08:05.877
I didn't.

08:06.044 --> 08:08.087
- Mommy?
- You can't remember?

08:08.255 --> 08:11.507
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

08:11.675 --> 08:15.261
- Baby, you can't remember doing this?
- Who did that?

08:15.429 --> 08:18.514
- Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
- Mommy, who did that?

08:18.682 --> 08:20.892
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

08:22.352 --> 08:24.520
Can you wait in the car for me?

08:24.688 --> 08:27.148
Can I sit in front?

08:27.774 --> 08:31.110
- Of course you can sit in the front.
- Okay.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.959
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

08:46.127 --> 08:47.586
Hi.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.299
I just wanna pay for the gas.

08:51.467 --> 08:54.594
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

08:54.762 --> 08:57.764
I can't seem to find it on the map.

08:57.932 --> 09:01.434
- Why do you wanna go there?
- I... I read about it.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.395
Road don't go through no more.

09:05.064 --> 09:07.315
Your card was declined.

09:10.653 --> 09:12.237
Hey there.

09:12.488 --> 09:16.991
- Is everything all right?
- Don't talk to strangers.

09:18.661 --> 09:20.078
Good girl.

09:20.246 --> 09:23.331
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

09:27.962 --> 09:29.671
Why did you cut off the cards?

09:29.838 --> 09:31.924
That's not gonna stop me
from taking her there.

09:32.092 --> 09:35.052
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.554
She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.

09:38.014 --> 09:40.474
The medication doesn't work.

09:40.642 --> 09:43.270
She's getting worse every day.

09:44.021 --> 09:47.148
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

09:47.900 --> 09:49.859
...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.

09:50.027 --> 09:51.903
I'm not giving up on her, Chris.
I'm not.

09:52.071 --> 09:54.030
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

09:54.198 --> 09:56.992
Yes, Chris, I read them.

09:57.159 --> 10:00.745
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

10:01.539 --> 10:02.539
Listen, honey...

10:02.707 --> 10:06.251
- I love Sharon every bit as much as I...
- Chris, I gotta go.

10:08.379 --> 10:10.130
- I love you.

10:10.298 --> 10:13.967
- Need any help, ma'am?
- No, we're... We're fine, thanks.

10:17.054 --> 10:18.305
We're fine.

11:34.135 --> 11:36.136
Are we there?

11:36.638 --> 11:38.722
Not yet, honey.

11:50.527 --> 11:52.027
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

11:54.197 --> 11:55.572
Hey!

12:15.552 --> 12:17.302
Mommy!

12:48.670 --> 12:51.213
It's okay. It's just the radio.

12:51.381 --> 12:53.632
- I'm turning it off.
- Mommy!

13:45.103 --> 13:46.354
Sharon?

13:53.028 --> 13:54.695
Sharon!

13:56.114 --> 13:58.407
Somebody! Help!

13:58.825 --> 14:00.576
Please!

14:03.330 --> 14:05.623
We've had an accident!

14:10.338 --> 14:12.297
Anybody!

14:20.516 --> 14:23.309
Sharon. Honey.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.532
Ashes.

15:51.150 --> 15:59.450
Sharon!

16:00.243 --> 16:01.911
Wait!

16:02.371 --> 16:03.788
Sharon!

16:03.955 --> 16:05.498
Wait!

16:28.981 --> 16:30.315
Sharon!

16:34.487 --> 16:36.238
Sharon?

16:43.287 --> 16:44.914
Honey?

17:32.630 --> 17:33.839
What's happening?

17:40.890 --> 17:42.640
Mommy.

17:44.101 --> 17:45.810
Sharon.

18:20.722 --> 18:37.280
Sharon?

19:04.685 --> 19:06.102
Hello?

19:26.291 --> 19:27.583
Hey!

19:28.042 --> 19:29.293
Wait!

19:29.460 --> 19:31.003
Hey!

19:32.213 --> 19:38.802
Sharon.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.652
No!

20:15.466 --> 20:17.301
Help me!

20:20.889 --> 20:22.389
Help.

20:22.766 --> 20:25.267
Help me. Help.

20:25.435 --> 20:28.187
Someone! Shit!

20:32.150 --> 20:34.860
Get off me! Get off!

21:08.229 --> 21:09.647
Get off! Get off!

21:09.815 --> 21:11.148
Get off me!

21:11.316 --> 21:14.068
No! Get off me!

21:15.779 --> 21:18.614
No! Get off me! Get off me!

21:34.965 --> 21:36.340
Get off...!

23:27.581 --> 23:31.376
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.169
Please.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.966
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

23:40.010 --> 23:41.719
My daughter.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.889
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.475
We've all lost our children.

23:47.685 --> 23:49.562
Our light.

23:50.523 --> 23:52.524
They deceived me.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.109
Their evil.

23:54.610 --> 23:56.862
Their hate.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.366
They hurt my child.

24:01.534 --> 24:03.535
They did terrible things to her.

24:04.829 --> 24:06.538
Alessa.

24:08.541 --> 24:10.750
This is my daughter, Sharon.

24:10.918 --> 24:12.878
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

24:13.045 --> 24:18.216
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

24:18.593 --> 24:21.344
Yes, she's mine.

24:21.512 --> 24:22.721
- It was mine.
- It's mine.

24:22.889 --> 24:24.764
- It's mine.
- It's mine!

24:24.932 --> 24:26.766
- It's mine!
- Get off me!

24:34.442 --> 24:38.111
Into the fire
she swallowed their hate.

25:06.309 --> 25:08.810
- Hi there.
- Yeah.

25:10.647 --> 25:14.233
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.152
- Maybe you saw her?
- Daughter worked night shift.

25:19.280 --> 25:24.409
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

25:24.577 --> 25:26.787
- How do I get there?
- You don't.

25:26.955 --> 25:28.956
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

25:29.123 --> 25:31.667
...still burning underground,
you know?

25:31.834 --> 25:34.379
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

25:37.383 --> 25:38.925
Okay...

25:40.427 --> 25:42.470
...where's the turnoff?

25:55.527 --> 25:57.236
Sharon?

26:29.228 --> 26:30.729
Come on.

26:37.903 --> 26:41.489
Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.

26:41.657 --> 26:43.659
Christopher, it's me.

26:44.286 --> 26:47.830
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

26:47.998 --> 26:50.291
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

26:50.459 --> 26:53.753
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

26:54.755 --> 26:57.465
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

26:57.632 --> 27:01.344
Please, please, hurry.

27:04.139 --> 27:05.222
Fuck. Come on!

27:05.390 --> 27:07.850
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.022
Put both hands on the wheel.

27:15.192 --> 27:17.026
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

27:17.611 --> 27:20.822
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.991
- Get out of the car.
- What?

27:23.159 --> 27:24.743
Move it.

27:25.953 --> 27:27.621
Jesus, what are you doing?

27:27.789 --> 27:29.915
- You're under arrest.
- What?

27:30.083 --> 27:33.126
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

27:33.294 --> 27:36.088
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.798
My daughter, she's in danger.

27:37.965 --> 27:40.134
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

27:40.302 --> 27:42.553
Listen to me, she 's ill.
She sleepwalks.

27:42.721 --> 27:45.139
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

27:47.476 --> 27:49.811
Officer Bennett to base, over.

27:51.772 --> 27:54.023
Base, do you copy, over?

27:54.483 --> 27:57.151
- Shit.
- You're bleeding.

28:01.782 --> 28:03.616
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

28:03.784 --> 28:07.286
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

28:07.663 --> 28:10.998
- You all right to walk?
- Sure.

28:11.166 --> 28:13.836
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

28:14.003 --> 28:15.337
What?

28:16.548 --> 28:18.340
You're going back to the station.

28:18.508 --> 28:20.676
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

28:21.469 --> 28:23.178
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

28:23.346 --> 28:24.972
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Have you heard...

28:25.140 --> 28:26.682
...a single word I've said?

28:27.559 --> 28:30.269
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around...

28:30.437 --> 28:33.272
- Silent Hill...
- sorry...

28:33.440 --> 28:35.023
- Sharon...
- lost...

28:35.191 --> 28:40.864
- think I know where...
- going to the school to look for her...

28:41.031 --> 28:42.532
I'm not okay...

28:42.700 --> 28:46.911
I need your... Your help.
Please, hurry!

29:04.638 --> 29:07.433
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

29:07.601 --> 29:10.478
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

29:11.313 --> 29:15.733
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

29:16.568 --> 29:20.279
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

29:21.239 --> 29:22.239
Bring him down.

29:22.407 --> 29:24.074
- Come on.
- You've seen her?

29:30.582 --> 29:31.665
Where is she?

29:32.292 --> 29:34.753
Inspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

29:34.921 --> 29:37.172
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.590
I know. Hang on a second.

29:38.758 --> 29:41.176
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.595
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

29:43.763 --> 29:46.306
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

29:46.474 --> 29:48.308
- Good Christ.
- Now, you mind telling me...

29:48.476 --> 29:50.477
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

29:50.645 --> 29:52.771
- Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
- My pleasure, Chris...

29:52.939 --> 29:55.649
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

29:55.816 --> 29:58.319
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

29:58.487 --> 30:00.613
I've also got a missing deputy.

30:00.781 --> 30:02.907
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

30:03.075 --> 30:05.868
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

30:06.036 --> 30:08.371
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

30:08.539 --> 30:10.456
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

30:10.624 --> 30:12.250
- Let's take a look around.
- Yes, sir.

30:12.417 --> 30:14.293
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

30:16.338 --> 30:19.006
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

30:19.174 --> 30:20.883
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

30:21.552 --> 30:23.970
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

30:24.137 --> 30:27.640
- I thought it would help her.
- You people. You get off the highway...

30:27.808 --> 30:31.478
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

30:33.273 --> 30:35.566
Why aren't you listening to me?

30:35.817 --> 30:38.151
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

30:38.319 --> 30:41.655
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

30:41.823 --> 30:43.657
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

30:43.825 --> 30:46.660
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

30:46.828 --> 30:49.037
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

30:49.205 --> 30:51.583
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

30:51.750 --> 30:53.167
Come on.

30:58.132 --> 30:59.882
What the hell?

31:35.920 --> 31:37.671
Okay.

31:37.839 --> 31:40.090
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

31:40.258 --> 31:41.884
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

31:42.052 --> 31:44.512
No. Get walking.

31:44.680 --> 31:47.349
There's a fire-lookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

31:47.516 --> 31:50.268
- It should have a radio.
- Fuck you, you stupid cop.

31:50.895 --> 31:53.772
This place is completely cut off.

31:54.565 --> 31:57.067
- You have no idea what's going on.
- Hey!

31:58.194 --> 32:00.362
Hey, you up there!

32:01.530 --> 32:03.657
I'm a police officer!

32:07.745 --> 32:09.412
What's going on?

32:17.088 --> 32:18.922
What is that?

32:23.386 --> 32:24.761
Stand back.

32:28.266 --> 32:30.726
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.242
Stay where you are!

32:46.911 --> 32:48.453
Stop!

34:41.321 --> 34:42.362
Sharon!

36:11.789 --> 36:13.582
Rose.

36:33.187 --> 36:35.438
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

36:35.606 --> 36:37.523
...and I will take you to safety.

36:37.691 --> 36:40.610
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

36:40.778 --> 36:42.779
...and I will take you to safety.

36:42.947 --> 36:45.698
- Why don't you let me do that?
- Ninety percent of the time...

36:45.866 --> 36:47.200
...when a wife takes a run...

36:47.368 --> 36:49.702
...she takes the daughter
to a place like this...

36:49.870 --> 36:51.913
...I'd say she's damn mad
at her husband.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.875
You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

36:56.043 --> 36:59.504
No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

36:59.672 --> 37:02.132
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.218
You see the barbershop over there?

37:04.678 --> 37:07.262
- Used to be my father's.
- Your father?

37:08.723 --> 37:10.516
He's dead.

37:10.892 --> 37:13.269
November '74,
when the fire caught.

37:13.437 --> 37:16.815
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

37:16.983 --> 37:19.985
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

37:20.152 --> 37:22.862
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

37:23.030 --> 37:24.656
That was the end of Silent Hill.

37:24.824 --> 37:28.076
These were good people,
most of them.

37:28.285 --> 37:30.620
Some, you might say deserved it.

37:30.788 --> 37:32.372
A little bit.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.181
Sharon!

39:21.778 --> 39:23.070
Sharon.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.742
Where are you hiding?

39:39.797 --> 39:44.342
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

39:46.554 --> 39:48.471
Alessa Gillespie.

39:49.765 --> 39:56.813
Hey!

39:59.692 --> 40:00.775
Wait!

41:05.344 --> 41:07.053
It's okay.

41:09.139 --> 41:11.265
It's gonna be okay.

41:14.478 --> 41:16.979
I promise I'm gonna help you.

43:06.844 --> 43:08.345
Come on.

43:08.846 --> 43:10.723
Oh, God.

43:11.058 --> 43:12.641
Come on.

43:17.981 --> 43:23.903
Help me. Oh, God.
Please, please, help me. Help...

43:25.739 --> 43:32.078
Help me. Please, help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

44:25.050 --> 44:27.093
It's happening again.

46:43.777 --> 46:48.156
Help me! Please! Please!

47:00.378 --> 47:02.963
Come on! Come on!

47:17.061 --> 47:18.854
Rose!

47:20.398 --> 47:22.190
Sharon!

47:25.903 --> 48:33.306
Rose!

48:44.194 --> 48:45.945
Rose.

49:01.336 --> 49:03.629
- Rose!
- Put your mask on.

49:03.797 --> 49:06.465
Rose, where are you?

49:12.639 --> 49:15.224
- I felt her.
- You what?

49:15.392 --> 49:16.767
Her perfume.

49:18.103 --> 49:19.520
- She was here.
- Who was?

49:19.688 --> 49:21.773
- My wife.
- She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

49:21.941 --> 49:24.735
- Perfume.
- Breathe. Through that mask.

49:26.195 --> 49:28.822
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.

49:28.990 --> 49:30.824
Chris, come on.

49:32.827 --> 49:34.703
- She was here.
- No, no, she wasn't here.

49:34.871 --> 49:35.871
I know it.

49:51.638 --> 49:52.930
Come on.

49:53.098 --> 49:55.558
Come on. Let's keep looking.

50:22.462 --> 50:24.671
Get off! Get off! Get off!

50:38.562 --> 50:40.480
Get me that pipe.

50:41.357 --> 50:43.608
Rose, the pipe!

50:44.610 --> 50:46.778
Okay. Okay.

50:48.405 --> 50:51.115
- I got it. I got it.
- Quick, come on!

51:06.508 --> 51:08.300
Can we get out of here?

51:08.844 --> 51:10.469
We're trapped.

51:11.054 --> 51:12.555
Last mag.

51:12.722 --> 51:15.432
- That's all the bullets you got?
- Yeah.

51:18.103 --> 51:19.728
Thanks.

51:31.826 --> 51:33.076
You hear that?

51:41.085 --> 51:42.961
That's him.

51:48.301 --> 51:50.302
Stay down! Stay down!

51:50.469 --> 51:52.596
Jesus Christ.

51:54.181 --> 51:56.099
Get down!

52:03.150 --> 52:04.817
Shit!

53:11.679 --> 53:12.720
What?

53:52.304 --> 53:56.391
What the fuck?

53:58.686 --> 54:01.438
You saw that, right?
That was real?

54:03.858 --> 54:05.316
What the fuck is going on?

54:05.484 --> 54:08.236
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

54:08.404 --> 54:10.822
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

54:10.990 --> 54:13.950
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

54:14.702 --> 54:16.828
I don't even know where to start.

54:17.204 --> 54:18.913
I found this.

54:19.081 --> 54:21.082
It's from a hotel.

54:21.250 --> 54:24.211
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

54:24.963 --> 54:26.630
Hotel?

54:30.052 --> 54:31.594
Hey.

54:33.388 --> 54:35.473
It's gonna be okay.

54:37.184 --> 54:39.227
We're gonna be okay.

54:52.158 --> 54:54.076
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

54:54.243 --> 54:56.286
We got men up here
all night long.

54:56.454 --> 54:59.206
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

54:59.373 --> 55:02.334
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

55:02.960 --> 55:05.128
You're not telling me everything.

55:06.380 --> 55:07.714
What really happened up here?

55:07.882 --> 55:10.217
Just let it rest in peace.

55:13.429 --> 55:15.847
- Directory assistance.
- Toluca County Archives, please.

55:16.015 --> 55:17.557
One moment.

55:17.850 --> 55:20.228
- Archives?
- Yeah, listen.

55:20.395 --> 55:23.022
Do you have the records there
from Silent Hill?

55:23.190 --> 55:26.359
- Which records, sir?
- The police records.

55:26.527 --> 55:29.028
Sorry, sir,
those records are confidential.

55:29.196 --> 55:31.365
No, no, I can't...
No, listen, I...

55:31.533 --> 55:33.784
Sorry, sir,
I can't access that information.

55:33.952 --> 55:35.452
- Listen, goddamn it.
- Sir.

55:35.620 --> 55:37.037
- This is an emergency.
- I can't...

55:37.205 --> 55:39.248
I can't help you.

55:55.473 --> 55:58.225
They used to say
this place was haunted.

55:58.810 --> 56:00.936
I think they were right.

56:10.363 --> 56:12.990
Help! No!

56:13.158 --> 56:15.033
- Stay away.
- Come on.

56:15.201 --> 56:18.121
Stay away, sinner.

56:18.289 --> 56:19.664
Get back!

56:19.832 --> 56:21.666
Hey.

56:21.834 --> 56:23.586
It's here.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.590
Faith is our destroyer.
Faith has brought us doom.

56:27.757 --> 56:29.675
- Get back!
- Hey, hey!

56:29.843 --> 56:32.803
- Get back!
- Hey, stop.

56:32.971 --> 56:35.389
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

56:35.557 --> 56:37.933
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

56:38.602 --> 56:40.686
It's your sins which hold you here.

56:40.854 --> 56:42.438
- Stop your lies!
- Calm down.

56:42.606 --> 56:43.606
Calm down, it's okay.

56:43.773 --> 56:45.941
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- She's gone.

56:46.902 --> 56:48.485
What's your name?

56:48.820 --> 56:52.448
Anna. My name is Anna.

56:52.616 --> 56:54.658
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

56:54.826 --> 56:57.953
- I've seen her before.
- Dahlia was cast out.

56:58.121 --> 57:00.206
Not even the darkness wants her.

57:00.373 --> 57:03.000
- She's lost her daughter too.
- What?

57:03.168 --> 57:08.547
- Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
- What are you doing here, Anna?

57:10.300 --> 57:12.885
Mother needs more food.

57:13.470 --> 57:15.096
You mean there are
other people here?

57:18.185 --> 57:20.186
Christabella keeps us safe.

57:20.354 --> 57:22.813
- Anna.
- We take refuge in the church.

57:23.315 --> 57:26.234
Anna, listen to me.

57:26.777 --> 57:29.195
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.198
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

57:32.366 --> 57:34.367
Tell me, have you seen her?

57:34.534 --> 57:35.952
Do you know where she is?

57:39.706 --> 57:42.667
If she has faith, she might survive.

57:42.834 --> 57:43.834
If not...

57:46.838 --> 57:47.922
I'm taking this.

57:50.217 --> 57:51.968
Have you seen this?

57:52.511 --> 57:54.804
I've seen it at the school.

57:55.347 --> 57:59.183
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

57:59.351 --> 58:03.854
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

58:15.244 --> 58:16.953
Rose, look at this.

58:19.039 --> 58:22.208
- What is it?
- Just like yours.

58:23.585 --> 58:27.046
- Where did you find it?
- They're all over the floor.

58:41.312 --> 58:42.562
Rose.

58:43.272 --> 58:44.897
Check this out.

58:46.734 --> 58:50.862
- What number did you take this from?
- 111.

58:52.823 --> 58:55.158
We gotta go to room 111.

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:30.340
Gucci.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.874
- Directory assistance.
- Yeah.

01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:06.086
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:08.297
One moment, please.

01:01:10.175 --> 01:01:12.509
- Yes, I have that information for you.
- Yeah.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.679
Can you give me that address?

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:28.066
We are wandering far
from refuge here.

01:01:30.236 --> 01:01:33.197
Let's keep her with us.
She's all we got.

01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:02.061
There's no room 111.

01:02:02.229 --> 01:02:04.688
The first burning.

01:02:05.524 --> 01:02:09.068
- What is it, Anna?
- The first burning.

01:02:09.236 --> 01:02:11.195
Before the town had a name.

01:02:11.363 --> 01:02:14.865
The elders of my elders
kept us pure.

01:02:15.408 --> 01:02:17.785
The founders of this town
were witch-hunters.

01:02:18.245 --> 01:02:20.788
Burning the witch
held back the darkness.

01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:22.623
It stopped the apocalypse.

01:02:28.463 --> 01:02:30.130
It's here.

01:02:46.482 --> 01:02:48.692
There's a room in here.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.747
Look at this.

01:03:09.673 --> 01:03:11.257
Here.

01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:13.676
Damn.

01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:30.986
What is this place?

01:03:31.154 --> 01:03:33.363
I don't know.
We're in the next building.

01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:35.657
Some factory, maybe?

01:03:37.368 --> 01:03:39.536
Looks like there was a fire.

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.628
Hey.

01:04:08.567 --> 01:04:10.276
Rose!

01:04:41.059 --> 01:04:42.935
Who are you?

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.117
It's okay.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:01.663
Don't be scared.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:05:19.975 --> 01:05:21.642
Rose?

01:05:43.498 --> 01:05:45.833
Okay. Come on.

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:47.710
Come on.

01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:55.093
It's okay. Hey.

01:05:55.344 --> 01:05:56.803
Hey.

01:05:59.766 --> 01:06:09.901
It's okay.

01:06:10.068 --> 01:06:12.278
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:06:22.539 --> 01:06:23.790
Oh, my God.

01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:26.542
You could be her twin.

01:06:30.714 --> 01:06:32.715
Are you Alessa?

01:06:34.426 --> 01:06:36.552
Where's my Sharon?

01:06:37.221 --> 01:06:39.055
Look at me.

01:06:40.516 --> 01:06:42.517
I'm burning.

01:06:45.312 --> 01:06:46.855
Rose?

01:06:49.692 --> 01:06:50.818
Rose? My God.

01:06:51.736 --> 01:06:54.279
- How did you get over there?
- Where is she?

01:06:58.619 --> 01:07:00.036
Grab onto it.

01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:05.041
- Now swing back around.
- Okay.

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.214
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.299
What the hell
were you doing over there?

01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:15.009
You're gonna get yourself killed.

01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:17.887
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:21.266
She was the one
that brought us here.

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:22.767
What are you talking about?

01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:25.353
She was the one
that made me crash my car.

01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:27.272
Alessa.

01:07:27.439 --> 01:07:29.649
We don't say her name.

01:07:33.404 --> 01:07:35.947
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

01:07:36.949 --> 01:07:39.325
The symbol of your faith?

01:07:42.037 --> 01:07:44.290
Something terrible happened here.

01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:51.673
We have to leave.
We have to leave!

01:07:52.967 --> 01:07:55.176
- The darkness is coming!
- Let's go.

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:57.220
Let's go!

01:08:08.983 --> 01:08:11.276
The church isn't far.

01:08:11.444 --> 01:08:13.361
- Run. Run!
- Rose, come on!

01:08:13.529 --> 01:08:15.280
Rose!

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.832
Hurry!

01:08:33.966 --> 01:08:35.175
Rose.

01:08:35.343 --> 01:08:37.886
- Come!
- We gotta go.

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.491
- Rose, come on.
- I've seen this.

01:09:09.087 --> 01:09:10.837
Rose, let's go!

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:15.550
- Cybil!
- Rose, come on.

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:24.475
Cybil!

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:27.562
You run not towards sanctuary
but from your fears.

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:30.482
Do not join the others.
They are deceivers. They are damned.

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:32.234
- We gotta get inside.
- No!

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.027
They are wolves
in the skin of sheep.

01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:37.073
They brought about their own hell.
They'll take you with them.

01:09:37.241 --> 01:09:39.493
- Filth and lies!
- Hey!

01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:41.078
Stop it!

01:09:42.413 --> 01:09:45.582
Please. I've seen your daughter.
I've seen Alessa.

01:09:48.545 --> 01:09:51.171
- It's coming!
- She's dead, isn't she?

01:09:51.339 --> 01:09:53.048
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

01:09:53.508 --> 01:09:55.551
- Listen to me.
- Rose, hurry!

01:09:55.885 --> 01:09:57.970
She looks exactly like Sharon.

01:09:58.138 --> 01:10:00.597
She brought us here, didn't she?

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:06.562
Why? What does she want?

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.439
Evil wakes in vengeance.

01:10:08.606 --> 01:10:11.275
Be careful what you choose.

01:10:31.172 --> 01:10:32.714
Rose!

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:08.209
Oh, God, no.

01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.566
- Witches!
- She's evil.

01:11:31.734 --> 01:11:32.985
Keep away the witches!

01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:38.533
- No.
- Send them back!

01:11:39.118 --> 01:11:40.535
No.

01:11:41.078 --> 01:11:42.578
We're lost.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.340
This is a sanctuary.

01:12:04.393 --> 01:12:07.895
Please, Christabella,
they lured my Anna.

01:12:08.063 --> 01:12:10.523
They gave her to the fiend.

01:12:10.816 --> 01:12:14.443
Eleanor, you must remember
that Anna went against our laws.

01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:17.364
She went alone outside
into the devil's playground.

01:12:19.534 --> 01:12:22.870
She was not the responsibility
of these two strangers.

01:12:24.789 --> 01:12:26.957
We'll deal with them later.

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:34.924
Now we must pray.

01:12:55.821 --> 01:12:57.071
And then I saw them...

01:12:57.239 --> 01:13:00.658
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:03.703
And no home was left to them.

01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:05.997
And then I saw them...

01:13:06.165 --> 01:13:09.460
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:12.379
And no home was left to them.

01:13:12.797 --> 01:13:15.591
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:18.969
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

01:13:19.137 --> 01:13:24.183
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

01:13:24.351 --> 01:13:27.604
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

01:13:30.107 --> 01:13:34.486
And anyone's name not found
written in the book of life...

01:13:34.654 --> 01:13:37.864
...they will be thrown
into the lake of fire.

01:13:48.334 --> 01:13:51.211
And now I lay me down to sleep...

01:13:51.379 --> 01:13:54.339
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

01:13:54.507 --> 01:13:57.008
If I should die before I wake...

01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:00.763
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:02.807
Amen.

01:14:03.183 --> 01:14:05.935
All right, girls, into bed.
Quickly, now.

01:14:06.103 --> 01:14:08.729
No better place to be
on a rainy night.

01:14:08.897 --> 01:14:12.316
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl.
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

01:14:12.484 --> 01:14:14.902
No. No talking
after lights are out.

01:14:18.657 --> 01:14:20.616
Good night, children.

01:14:20.784 --> 01:14:22.827
And God bless.

01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.334
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret,
this really can't wait.

01:14:30.211 --> 01:14:32.045
I can't imagine why.

01:14:33.923 --> 01:14:35.757
Nine years ago...

01:14:35.925 --> 01:14:37.968
...a baby was left
outside this orphanage.

01:14:38.136 --> 01:14:40.262
My wife and I were the ones
who adopted her.

01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:43.265
I'm very happy for you,
Mr. Da Silva...

01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:47.269
...but I can't give out
information on our children.

01:14:48.855 --> 01:14:50.188
Look.

01:14:51.524 --> 01:14:54.569
That girl, she looks
exactly like my daughter.

01:14:54.737 --> 01:14:56.738
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

01:14:56.905 --> 01:14:59.574
- It's late.
- She must be 40 now.

01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:00.992
Where can I find her?

01:15:01.827 --> 01:15:03.745
This story isn't hers alone...

01:15:03.912 --> 01:15:05.663
...but all of ours!
- You people.

01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:07.040
You got yourself something.

01:15:07.207 --> 01:15:10.209
You know what you got now, Chris?
How about breaking and entering?

01:15:10.377 --> 01:15:12.503
By the looks of this,
a little assault as well.

01:15:13.172 --> 01:15:14.922
Thank you, Thomas.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.759
- This can't go any farther.
- It won't, Sister.

01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:21.429
You know,
I have some 12-year-olds...

01:15:21.597 --> 01:15:23.974
...who cover their tracks
better than you do.

01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:25.684
What's this?

01:15:25.852 --> 01:15:27.436
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

01:15:27.604 --> 01:15:30.105
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

01:15:35.278 --> 01:15:38.781
- Look, turn around.
- What are you doing?

01:15:40.825 --> 01:15:43.911
I knew that girl. I did.

01:15:45.038 --> 01:15:47.624
I was told she didn't make it
through the night.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:50.001
The night of the fire.

01:15:50.252 --> 01:15:52.295
The night of the big fire
in Silent Hill.

01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:57.008
There were these people...

01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:00.178
...these fanatics.

01:16:00.346 --> 01:16:03.640
What they did
to that child was terrible.

01:16:03.808 --> 01:16:06.559
That was 30 years ago,
and it's over now.

01:16:06.977 --> 01:16:08.645
Not as far as I'm concerned.

01:16:09.271 --> 01:16:11.314
What's it gonna be, city boy?

01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:14.025
I can put you in jail...

01:16:14.193 --> 01:16:15.902
...or you can go home.

01:16:16.487 --> 01:16:19.240
And that's your definition of justice?

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:24.161
Many different forms
of justice, Chris.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.915
See, you've got man's, God's...

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.835
...and even the devil's.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:35.005
Certain forms you just can't control.

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.175
So I want you to go home now...

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.804
...to your nice warm bed...

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:43.432
...and let me deal with this town...

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.351
...and what has happened
over the last 30 years.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:49.354
Okay? End of story.

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.161
Tell me first how you got here.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:08.748
Honestly, I don't know
how I got here.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.835
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:14.671
...and all I know is that
I'm supposed to be in this church.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.883
Are you a person of faith?

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.385
- I love my daughter.
- That's not what I asked.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.887
Who are you to judge?

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:24.307
We judge because the souls of history
hang in the balance.

01:17:24.475 --> 01:17:26.142
Because our faith
has never failed us.

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.769
Our faith keeps the darkness
of hell at bay.

01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:32.566
Then use your faith
to help me find my little girl.

01:17:33.193 --> 01:17:35.235
Only the demon knows where she is.

01:17:35.403 --> 01:17:37.696
Then tell me,
where do I find this demon?

01:17:39.532 --> 01:17:42.075
No one has ever returned
from the core of the darkness...

01:17:42.243 --> 01:17:43.660
...where the demon lies in wait.

01:17:43.828 --> 01:17:45.287
She's not gonna help us.
Let's go.

01:17:45.455 --> 01:17:48.040
If you wish to face the demon
to find your daughter...

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:49.416
...I won't stop you.

01:17:49.584 --> 01:17:52.294
- Christabella, they can't go down...
- Silence, Adam.

01:17:56.007 --> 01:17:58.717
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

01:17:59.135 --> 01:18:01.261
Perhaps not.

01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:17.320
If you don't wanna do this...

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.323
...I'll understand.

01:18:21.492 --> 01:18:23.493
Sharon's adopted...

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:25.621
...but I'm her mother.

01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:28.916
I knew that from the moment
I first laid eyes on her.

01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:33.128
She's lucky to have you.

01:18:34.548 --> 01:18:37.299
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

01:19:48.165 --> 01:19:49.624
Quiet.

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:52.460
We're in his domain now.

01:19:57.883 --> 01:20:00.217
Look at this map. Memorize it.

01:20:01.219 --> 01:20:03.387
Your memory may save your life.

01:20:04.723 --> 01:20:07.725
- Do you see this room?
- Yeah.

01:20:07.893 --> 01:20:10.605
That is where the darkness lies.

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:13.232
The demon is in the bowels
of this building.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.777
It hides behind the face
of an innocent.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.278
You mean a child?

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:19.739
Don't believe your eyes.
Your eyes will lie to you.

01:20:19.907 --> 01:20:23.034
Faith is the only truth.

01:20:24.078 --> 01:20:25.286
I will pray for you, Rose...

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:28.748
...but I won't expect you
and your friend to return.

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:31.167
Goodbye.

01:20:33.587 --> 01:20:34.962
Adam.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:38.675
Left. Right.

01:20:39.343 --> 01:20:41.719
Left. Left.

01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:46.849
- Right. Right. Left.
- Take them to the lower level.

01:20:47.017 --> 01:20:48.851
- In the basement?
- Do it, then return.

01:20:49.019 --> 01:20:51.437
- Left. 3A.
- But...

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:53.189
- Right. 4A.
- I said, do it.

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:57.527
- Left. Left. Right.
- Rose. Rose.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:02.615
- Left. Right. Left. Left.
- Rose, she's killing you.

01:21:02.783 --> 01:21:05.119
- Rose!
- Let me do this.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.289
I need to do this.

01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:27.851
Take this.

01:21:28.018 --> 01:21:31.896
They'll be drawn to the light,
but you won't be able to see without it.

01:21:34.692 --> 01:21:36.443
Thank you.

01:21:42.825 --> 01:21:45.618
- So this thing actually works?
- It will.

01:21:45.786 --> 01:21:47.829
If the demon wants you, it will.

01:21:49.999 --> 01:21:51.207
Forgive me.

01:21:52.585 --> 01:21:55.295
We've lived too long as scavengers.
I believe this is yours.

01:22:02.889 --> 01:22:05.640
Witch! Her child's
the likeness of Alessa.

01:22:05.808 --> 01:22:07.184
Her child's the next vessel.

01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:10.187
Stop her!
Don't let the witches go down!

01:22:15.026 --> 01:22:16.568
Come on!

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.454
Get off her!

01:22:29.624 --> 01:22:30.957
Find her.

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:34.377
No! Wait! Cybil!

01:22:34.545 --> 01:22:36.713
Cybil! Open the door!

01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:02.199
No!

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.458
8A.

01:24:32.959 --> 01:24:37.297
7A. Right.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:50.602
Right. 6A.

01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:53.980
4A.

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:56.859
3A.

01:24:59.446 --> 01:25:02.198
Left, left. Right, right.

01:25:02.366 --> 01:25:05.076
Left, left.

01:26:19.111 --> 01:26:23.073
Okay. I can do this.

01:27:34.106 --> 01:27:37.024
Congratulations, Rose.

01:27:37.192 --> 01:27:38.859
You're here.

01:27:40.445 --> 01:27:42.029
You did it.

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:48.161
Your reward is the truth.

01:27:50.873 --> 01:27:55.001
Did you see that Alessa
was a good little girl?

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:01.216
Even though nobody
looked at her that way.

01:28:01.926 --> 01:28:07.390
- Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
- Their parents told them she was bad.

01:28:08.433 --> 01:28:11.811
She didn't have a father
like they did.

01:28:18.068 --> 01:28:21.070
Alessa was alone in the world.

01:28:25.409 --> 01:28:29.871
You know what can happen
to little girls when they're left alone.

01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:35.918
It's okay, it's me, come on.

01:28:36.086 --> 01:28:38.504
Even her mother couldn't help.

01:28:40.883 --> 01:28:43.886
Even though she loved her baby.

01:28:44.762 --> 01:28:47.681
But the rest of the family
didn't love Alessa.

01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:51.143
They were just like the others
and made her scared.

01:28:51.311 --> 01:28:53.228
We know.
Even the children know it.

01:28:53.396 --> 01:28:54.938
Your daughter...

01:28:56.232 --> 01:28:58.567
Why you won't
just name the father...

01:29:01.989 --> 01:29:04.699
You've brought sin amongst us.

01:29:04.867 --> 01:29:06.826
The faithful must gather
in judgment...

01:29:06.994 --> 01:29:10.121
...for we are called to purify this filth.

01:29:10.331 --> 01:29:12.207
What does she mean, Mommy?

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:16.085
You're weak, my dear sister.
You always were.

01:29:16.253 --> 01:29:19.797
Trust us, Dahlia.
Have faith in our virtue.

01:29:19.965 --> 01:29:22.467
We will restore innocence.

01:29:23.135 --> 01:29:27.347
They had met many times
since the town was built...

01:29:27.514 --> 01:29:30.767
...to restore innocence and purity.

01:29:31.727 --> 01:29:33.978
They had a special place for that.

01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:48.911
Do you remember the hotel?

01:29:49.454 --> 01:29:52.249
I led you to all these places...

01:29:52.416 --> 01:29:55.877
...and you were very good
at following my clues.

01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:58.880
You may leave, Dahlia.

01:29:59.632 --> 01:30:01.508
We fight the sin, not the sinner.

01:30:02.051 --> 01:30:04.302
Mommy! Mommy!

01:30:05.012 --> 01:30:06.554
Mommy!

01:30:06.722 --> 01:30:10.058
You know how that feels,
don't you, Rose?

01:30:10.601 --> 01:30:12.978
To lose your little girl?

01:30:13.688 --> 01:30:15.855
What have I done?

01:30:18.359 --> 01:30:22.654
- Oh, God.
- Weep not for the demon.

01:30:23.197 --> 01:30:24.447
No!

01:30:24.615 --> 01:30:28.410
Once again
we are locked in mortal battle.

01:30:29.036 --> 01:30:32.622
They thought they knew
how to cast out evil.

01:30:33.749 --> 01:30:37.544
- Praise God for our clarity.
- Amen.

01:30:37.712 --> 01:30:41.966
Praise the innocent
for their sacrifice.

01:30:42.134 --> 01:30:44.135
But you should be careful
how you fight evil.

01:30:44.303 --> 01:30:47.431
- They give us back our purity.
- Purity.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.519
- And our unity.
- Unity.

01:30:52.687 --> 01:30:56.356
Your weapons
can turn back on you.

01:31:21.799 --> 01:31:26.261
No.

01:31:26.429 --> 01:31:29.556
Now you know
why Dahlia is broken.

01:31:31.142 --> 01:31:33.560
She tried to get help...

01:31:33.728 --> 01:31:35.897
...but she went too late.

01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:39.485
Get her up, boys.
Get her up now!

01:31:39.819 --> 01:31:42.112
There were good people
in the town...

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.573
...people like you, Rose.

01:31:44.741 --> 01:31:47.201
People who like to help.

01:31:49.913 --> 01:31:54.291
Alessa was so lonely
and hurt and scared.

01:31:54.793 --> 01:31:57.544
They should have known better
than to hurt her so badly.

01:32:00.924 --> 01:32:03.550
When you're hurt
and scared for so long...

01:32:04.469 --> 01:32:06.970
...your fear and pain turn to hate...

01:32:07.138 --> 01:32:11.225
...and the hate
starts to change the world.

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.982
Alessa's hate grew and grew,
burning inside her.

01:32:23.238 --> 01:32:25.948
Her hate got so strong...

01:32:26.491 --> 01:32:30.285
...she even hurt someone
who was only curious.

01:32:44.594 --> 01:32:46.804
That's when I came.

01:32:53.854 --> 01:32:55.855
I told her it was their turn.

01:32:57.732 --> 01:33:03.487
I promised they would all
fall into her darkest dream.

01:33:33.145 --> 01:33:37.857
Now, Rose, we must talk.

01:34:30.538 --> 01:34:32.956
Don't be afraid.

01:34:39.171 --> 01:34:41.130
She won't hurt you.

01:34:41.715 --> 01:34:43.967
She needs your help.

01:34:44.134 --> 01:34:45.343
Who is she?

01:34:46.387 --> 01:34:49.514
- She is Alessa.
- Then who are you?

01:34:49.932 --> 01:34:53.893
I have many names.

01:34:54.436 --> 01:34:58.273
Right now,
I'm the dark part of Alessa.

01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:01.109
Where's my child?

01:35:01.569 --> 01:35:04.612
She's not your child.

01:35:06.657 --> 01:35:07.991
She's hers.

01:35:09.035 --> 01:35:12.788
The little girl is
what's left of her goodness.

01:35:13.081 --> 01:35:14.707
We hid her in safety...

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:18.043
...in the world outside this hell.

01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:35.270
Now the dream
of this life must end...

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:39.357
...and so, too,
must the dreamers within it.

01:35:39.525 --> 01:35:41.860
For over 30 years...

01:35:42.028 --> 01:35:45.196
...they've lied to their own souls.

01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:49.618
For 30 years they've denied
their own fate.

01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:52.954
But now is the end of days...

01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:55.999
...and I am the reaper.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.168
What do you want?

01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.879
All we ask for is satisfaction.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.882
Satisfaction?

01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:05.676
Revenge.

01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:09.221
Why me?

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.599
You chose.

01:36:12.059 --> 01:36:14.393
You chose Sharon.

01:36:14.561 --> 01:36:17.855
Christabella will find Sharon.

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:20.900
She plans to purify her.

01:36:23.154 --> 01:36:25.197
Oh, God, no.

01:36:25.782 --> 01:36:29.201
Their blind conviction
repels me from their church.

01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:33.080
I cannot enter
while they deny their fate...

01:36:33.247 --> 01:36:34.748
...but you can.

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:40.420
- Just tell me what I need to do.
- Tell them the truth.

01:37:53.247 --> 01:37:55.165
The child is mine!

01:37:55.332 --> 01:37:57.333
Mine!

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.758
She's mine.

01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:08.428
She's mine!

01:38:14.393 --> 01:38:17.688
The truth is clear to those who see.

01:38:18.732 --> 01:38:22.359
Just as I could see
you had this child.

01:38:41.172 --> 01:38:42.714
Let's go.

01:38:45.384 --> 01:38:48.512
Out of the car. Turn around.

01:39:03.528 --> 01:39:05.529
Just a friendly warning...

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:08.573
...I'll be back with people
who know what they're doing.

01:39:11.369 --> 01:39:15.122
Before you do that, Chris,
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:19.752
Few years back, some wacko,
he abducted a kid...

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.089
...threw him down a mine vent
up there in Silent Hill.

01:39:23.465 --> 01:39:25.758
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:27.677
She spent three days
holding onto him...

01:39:27.845 --> 01:39:30.096
...keeping him alive
until they were rescued.

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:31.722
We know what we're doing.

01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.892
I need to do everything I can.

01:39:40.817 --> 01:39:42.651
Let's go.

01:40:06.301 --> 01:40:08.552
Please.
Christabella, let her live.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.972
Your weakness
led these souls to judgment.

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.474
- This time you will bear witness.
- She is innocent.

01:40:13.642 --> 01:40:16.644
Look at her.
She's the whelp of your daughter.

01:40:16.812 --> 01:40:18.062
The demon!

01:40:18.606 --> 01:40:23.860
The demon fathered this disgusting
abomination from her child!

01:40:24.028 --> 01:40:25.111
No, she's mine!

01:40:28.241 --> 01:40:30.326
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

01:40:30.493 --> 01:40:33.120
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

01:40:33.288 --> 01:40:36.832
It's okay, it's okay.
Your mama's coming.

01:40:37.542 --> 01:40:41.253
Once again we are called upon
to restore innocence.

01:40:41.421 --> 01:40:45.341
We burn this witch.
We vanquish evil.

01:40:46.217 --> 01:40:48.427
No. You can't. You can't.

01:40:48.595 --> 01:40:51.263
- Don't let her say this! No!
- We burn the child!

01:40:51.431 --> 01:40:53.682
We fight the demon!

01:40:56.645 --> 01:40:57.937
She's just a child!

01:40:58.104 --> 01:41:01.065
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

01:41:01.524 --> 01:41:03.484
Let her go!

01:41:03.902 --> 01:41:07.989
Leave her alone!

01:41:08.658 --> 01:41:10.533
Those who aid the demon...

01:41:10.701 --> 01:41:14.537
...they must be cleansed
by the fire from whence they came.

01:41:14.705 --> 01:41:17.332
That's crazy. You're crazy.

01:41:18.042 --> 01:41:20.252
No!

01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:22.088
Why are you listening to this?

01:41:22.255 --> 01:41:24.590
Why?

01:41:26.385 --> 01:41:29.387
Burn the witch! Burn her!

01:41:29.554 --> 01:41:34.684
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch!

01:41:41.692 --> 01:41:43.526
Sharon.

01:41:50.742 --> 01:41:52.785
Evil witch!

01:41:53.704 --> 01:41:55.746
Suffer.

01:42:00.127 --> 01:42:06.758
Burn the witch! Burn her!

01:42:12.141 --> 01:42:14.559
Oh, my God.

01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:32.243
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:33.995
Burn her!

01:42:36.373 --> 01:42:38.750
You're in your own hell.

01:42:46.884 --> 01:42:50.636
Mama, be with me.

01:43:13.996 --> 01:43:15.914
Here is where the apocalypse began.

01:43:16.082 --> 01:43:18.958
This is where we stopped
the annihilation of the world.

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:21.669
We drew a line in the sand
and said:

01:43:21.837 --> 01:43:24.297
"Demon, you will not cross!"

01:43:24.465 --> 01:43:28.176
But the demon is wicked,
full of treachery.

01:43:28.344 --> 01:43:32.514
Yet again he comes to tempt us
in the guise of an innocent.

01:43:32.681 --> 01:43:34.724
To rid the world of this demon...

01:43:34.892 --> 01:43:37.560
...we must burn this child!

01:43:39.355 --> 01:43:41.397
That's not gonna happen!

01:43:44.401 --> 01:43:45.401
Mommy!

01:43:46.487 --> 01:43:49.906
It's okay, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:43:50.074 --> 01:43:54.119
Oh, my God.

01:43:54.286 --> 01:43:56.454
What have you people done?

01:43:56.622 --> 01:43:59.918
- You have returned.
- Yes, I have.

01:44:00.545 --> 01:44:02.546
The witch has returned.

01:44:05.508 --> 01:44:09.177
Do not believe her lies.

01:44:09.554 --> 01:44:11.555
I come from a world
outside this place.

01:44:12.014 --> 01:44:13.807
I come from a world full of life!

01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:18.812
Why don't you tell them the truth.

01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.440
Tell them the truth that you deny,
even to yourself.

01:44:22.608 --> 01:44:24.818
There was no apocalypse!

01:44:24.986 --> 01:44:27.070
You burned in the fire
that you started...

01:44:27.238 --> 01:44:30.574
...and nothing can save you
because you're already damned!

01:44:32.410 --> 01:44:33.743
- Mommy!
- Take her.

01:44:34.078 --> 01:44:36.496
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

01:44:37.081 --> 01:44:39.749
Burn her! Burn her!

01:44:40.084 --> 01:44:41.418
Demon witch!

01:44:41.586 --> 01:44:43.211
- Burn me?
- Demon witch.

01:44:43.379 --> 01:44:45.338
That's your answer.

01:44:45.882 --> 01:44:47.883
Burn anything you're afraid of.

01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:50.595
Burn anything you can't control.

01:44:52.472 --> 01:44:55.933
This woman uses your fear
to control you.

01:44:56.101 --> 01:44:58.687
She led you to burn
Alessa Gillespie.

01:44:58.855 --> 01:45:01.732
She led you to burn
an innocent child.

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:05.110
But you will not deny your guilt...

01:45:05.278 --> 01:45:07.863
...and you cannot deny her pain!

01:45:08.031 --> 01:45:11.241
That child was sin incarnate.

01:45:11.701 --> 01:45:15.287
No, it's you who have sinned.

01:45:16.497 --> 01:45:19.583
You darkened the heart
of an innocent...

01:45:19.751 --> 01:45:23.629
...and now you cower in the face
of Alessa's revenge.

01:45:23.796 --> 01:45:25.797
- Sinner.
- Heresy.

01:45:25.965 --> 01:45:28.050
Burn her. Burn her!

01:45:29.344 --> 01:45:33.430
Your faith brings death!

01:45:34.766 --> 01:45:36.725
You are alone in this limbo...

01:45:36.893 --> 01:45:39.686
...and God is not here.

01:45:41.064 --> 01:45:42.147
Mommy!

01:45:55.497 --> 01:45:59.583
She was a blasphemer.

01:46:00.377 --> 01:46:07.675
Blasphemer!

01:47:23.211 --> 01:47:25.004
What have you done?

01:47:25.881 --> 01:47:27.840
You've brought the darkness in
with you.

01:47:28.885 --> 01:47:30.969
Do you know what you've done?

01:47:40.104 --> 01:47:42.022
For Sharon.

01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:48.445
Mommy.

01:47:48.613 --> 01:47:51.491
Mommy. Mommy.

01:49:04.984 --> 01:49:06.609
Mommy!

01:49:35.515 --> 01:49:39.477
Oh, Lord, give me the strength
to stay pure.

01:50:13.722 --> 01:50:16.265
No! No!

01:50:48.258 --> 01:50:52.427
Alessa, what have you become?

01:51:06.485 --> 01:51:08.403
Mommy!

01:51:09.613 --> 01:51:13.074
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me.
It's Mommy.

01:51:34.305 --> 01:51:35.680
Down! We're getting down.

01:51:35.848 --> 01:51:38.309
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes, baby.

01:51:39.352 --> 01:51:52.072
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.785
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.

01:52:44.419 --> 01:52:47.923
Why did she not take me
with the others?

01:52:49.759 --> 01:52:51.927
Because you're her mother.

01:52:56.808 --> 01:52:59.851
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

01:53:27.922 --> 01:53:29.798
I love you.

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:41.207
- Hi, this is Chris.
- And this is Rose.

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:43.209
And I'm Sharon Da Silva.

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.795
Please leave a message!

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:50.341
Christopher, it's me.

01:54:50.884 --> 01:54:52.218
I'm with Sharon.

01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:57.681
Hello? Hello? Rose?

01:54:58.099 --> 01:54:59.558
Rose?

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.778
Yeah. We're coming home.
