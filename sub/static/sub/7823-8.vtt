01:29.000 --> 01:30.810
BART, WHEN I
WAS YOUR AGE

01:30.870 --> 01:33.040
I PULLED
A FEW BONERS.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.110
BUT I THINK
YOU'LL FIND

01:34.170 --> 01:36.030
THAT PEOPLE
ARE PRETTY DECENT

01:36.110 --> 01:36.950
IF YOU GIVE THEM
HALF A ..

01:37.010 --> 01:39.010
LOOK, THERE IT IS.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.480
THE HEAD.
KILL 'EM!

01:40.550 --> 01:43.020
( <i>screaming )</i>

01:59.500 --> 02:01.000
THEY GOT US CORNERED.

02:01.070 --> 02:01.740
WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.870
GIVE ME THE HEAD.

02:02.940 --> 02:05.270
NO DAD. THIS WHOLE THING
WAS MY FAULT.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.370
YOU RUN ALONG.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.180
SON, WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.940
NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING
IT MIGHT BE, I CAN'T LET

02:10.009 --> 02:13.550
MY ONLY BOY GET RIPPED APART
BY A BLOODTHIRSTY MOB.

02:13.610 --> 02:14.670
AH, DAD.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.650
WE'LL DIE TOGETHER

02:15.710 --> 02:17.710
LIKE A FATHER
AND SON SHOULD.

02:17.780 --> 02:18.710
NOW WE GOT THEM.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.680
IT'S HOMER SIMPSON.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.180
AND HIS KID, BART.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.510
LET'S KILL THEM!

02:23.590 --> 02:24.430
OFF THE KID!

02:26.290 --> 02:27.300
KILL HOMER!

02:27.360 --> 02:28.560
LET'S KILL THESE GUYS.

02:28.630 --> 02:32.630
MURDEROUS MOB,
I BEG YOU TO SPARE OUR LIVES--

02:32.700 --> 02:34.540
AT LEAST UNTIL
YOU'VE HEARD THE STORY

02:34.600 --> 02:35.970
OF HOW WE ENDED UP
WITH THE HEAD

02:36.030 --> 02:37.600
OF OUR BELOVED TOWN FOUNDER.

02:37.670 --> 02:40.280
HOW LONG WILL THE STORY TAKE?

02:40.340 --> 02:43.610
ABOUT 23 MINUTES
AND FIVE SECONDS.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.510
Man: THAT'S TOO LONG.
23:05?!

02:45.580 --> 02:48.250
WELL, ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.840
OKAY, IT ALL STARTED
SUNDAY MORNING.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.960
KIDS, WE'RE LATE
FOR CHURCH.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.890
GET YOUR BUTTS
DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.400
UHH!

03:01.460 --> 03:03.000
READY FOR INSPECTION, MOM.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.600
VERY NICE, MAGGIE.

03:05.660 --> 03:08.560
AND, LISA,
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.500
BART,
ASSUME THE POSITION.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.340
OH!

03:15.410 --> 03:16.640
AHH...

03:16.710 --> 03:17.850
OH, BART.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.510
NOW WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

03:19.580 --> 03:20.820
GET HIM!

03:20.880 --> 03:22.320
OH, NO!

03:22.380 --> 03:23.420
Marge:
HOMER?

03:23.480 --> 03:24.520
Announcer: Touchdown!

03:24.580 --> 03:27.110
We've got an upset
in the making.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.290
NO, WE DON'T!

03:28.350 --> 03:30.150
TRY BEING OBJECTIVE...

03:30.220 --> 03:31.590
LET'S GO, HOMER.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.190
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:33.260 --> 03:36.230
I HAVE 50 BUCKS
RIDING ON THIS GAME.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.400
OH, HOMER, YOU PROMISED ME.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.730
THIS ISN'T GAMBLING, MARGE.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.600
IT'S A LEAD-PIPE CINCH.

03:42.670 --> 03:43.740
( <i>growls )</i>

03:43.800 --> 03:45.360
Announcer:
Wallanowski at the 5.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.270
Oh, my!
He fumbles!

03:46.340 --> 03:47.380
OH, NO!

03:47.440 --> 03:49.840
It's recovered
in the end zone.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.050
Another touchdown.

03:51.110 --> 03:52.810
( <i>muffled scream )</i>

03:54.110 --> 03:56.240
WHY SHOULD I FEEL LIKE
A TRAFFIC COP

03:56.320 --> 03:57.690
EVERY SUNDAY MORNING?

03:57.750 --> 04:00.860
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE
GOODNESS INTO THE FAMILY.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.820
WHERE IS

04:01.890 --> 04:02.820
THE GAME?

04:02.890 --> 04:04.160
AH!

04:04.220 --> 04:07.190
Kogan's got Wallanowski
open in the end zone.

04:07.260 --> 04:07.930
He throws it...

04:07.990 --> 04:08.950
CATCH IT.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.160
It's complete.
Touchdown!

04:10.230 --> 04:11.630
ALL RIGHT!

04:11.700 --> 04:14.470
( <i>honking )</i>

04:14.530 --> 04:18.000
We got a barn burner here.
This could be the most
remarkable comeback

04:18.070 --> 04:20.640
since Lazarus rose
from the dead.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.280
Homer:
LAZA-WHO?

04:22.340 --> 04:23.980
Marge:
COME ON, EVERYBODY.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.400
WE'RE LATE.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.180
BART, PROMISE ME

04:27.250 --> 04:29.320
YOU'LL PAY ATTENTION
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.320
BART?

04:30.380 --> 04:31.540
BART?

04:31.620 --> 04:32.820
BART!
WHOA!

04:32.890 --> 04:34.290
YOU TALKING TO ME?

04:34.350 --> 04:35.580
WHAT'S THIS?

04:35.650 --> 04:36.780
OH!

04:36.860 --> 04:39.030
A PERSONAL STEREO.

04:39.090 --> 04:42.060
WERE YOU GOING
TO LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL?

04:42.130 --> 04:43.400
MAYBE. AH!

04:43.460 --> 04:45.200
CAN YOU
BELIEVE THIS, HOMER?

04:45.260 --> 04:46.190
HOMER?

04:46.270 --> 04:47.300
HOMER?!

04:47.370 --> 04:49.970
NO, NO, WE STINK!

04:50.040 --> 04:52.110
...the 30, 20,
10, touchdown!

04:52.170 --> 04:54.740
WERE YOU PLANNING ON SITTING IN
THE CAR TILL THE GAME IS OVER?

04:54.810 --> 04:56.240
MAYBE.

04:56.310 --> 04:58.250
<i>IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR
IRREVERENT ATTITUDE</i>

04:58.310 --> 05:01.120
BART THINKS HE CAN SNEAK
HEADPHONES INTO SUNDAY SCHOOL.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.650
NOW MOVE IT!

05:02.710 --> 05:03.840
Here's the kickoff.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.890
HMM...

05:04.950 --> 05:06.920
Oh my, he fumbles!

05:06.990 --> 05:09.020
WILL MY DOG, PEPPER,
BE THERE?

05:09.090 --> 05:11.530
I'M SORRY,
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.

05:11.590 --> 05:12.490
WHY NOT?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.200
HEAVEN IS FOR PEOPLE.

05:14.260 --> 05:15.800
WHAT ABOUT
MY CAT?

05:15.860 --> 05:17.970
I'M SORRY,
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.100
WILL THERE BE
CAVEMEN IN HEAVEN?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.860
CERTAINLY NOT.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.160
MA'AM. IF YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,
BUT YOU'RE IN A REALLY BAD FIGHT

05:24.240 --> 05:27.440
AND YOUR LEG GETS GANGRENE
AND HAS TO BE AMPUTATED

05:27.510 --> 05:29.380
WILL IT BE WAITING
FOR YOU IN HEAVEN?

05:29.440 --> 05:32.180
FOR THE LAST TIME,
BART, YES.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.570
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO BEGIN
TODAY'S SERMON

05:35.650 --> 05:37.220
WHICH I'VE ENTITLED

05:37.280 --> 05:40.680
"GAMBLING:
THE EIGHTH DEADLY SIN."

05:40.750 --> 05:43.150
TODAY IS SUNDAY,
THE LORD'S DAY

05:43.220 --> 05:47.730
AND YET, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
ARE NOT IN THE LORD'S HOUSE.

05:47.790 --> 05:51.460
THEY'RE IN THEIR OWN HOUSE
WORSHIPPING A FALSE IDOL--

05:51.530 --> 05:52.970
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL.

05:53.030 --> 05:54.740
It's a beautiful Sunday.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.040
Perfect football weather
for this incredible game.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.970
This game is brought to you
by the good people at
Duff Beer.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.380
You can't get enough
of that wonderful Duff.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.970
Radio: They're lining up
for this crucial kick.

06:07.050 --> 06:09.050
One final tick
of the clock remains.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.810
A win would cap
an amazing comeback

06:11.880 --> 06:15.180
but it's a 49-yard field goal
into the wind.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.150
MAKE IT, MAKE IT.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.530
The kick is up.

06:17.590 --> 06:18.490
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.130
It's got the distance.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.030
Holy Toledo!
It's good!

06:22.090 --> 06:23.250
IT'S GOOD!

06:23.330 --> 06:24.730
IT'S GOOD!!!

06:24.800 --> 06:26.470
( <i>whispering )</i>

06:26.530 --> 06:30.040
IT'S GOOD...
TO SEE YOU ALL IN CHURCH.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.640
PLEASE BE SEATED, HOMER.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.800
YEAH,
SIT DOWN, HOMER.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.170
THE VENTRILOQUIST
GOES TO HEAVEN

06:37.240 --> 06:38.900
BUT THE DUMMY DOESN'T.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.210
OH, OH, ME.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.450
BART.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.640
WHAT ABOUT A ROBOT
WITH A HUMAN BRAIN?

06:43.720 --> 06:44.690
I DON'T KNOW.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.890
ALL THESE QUESTIONS.

06:45.950 --> 06:49.360
IS A LITTLE BLIND FAITH
TOO MUCH TO ASK?

06:49.420 --> 06:50.320
( <i>cheering )</i>

06:50.390 --> 06:51.860
DON'T FORGET NEXT WEEK.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.150
REMEMBER TO READ...

06:54.230 --> 06:56.930
THAT WAS VERY NICE,
FATHER.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.370
I WAS PLEASED
YOU ENJOYED IT.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.600
I SEEM TO HAVE
STRUCK A CORD

07:01.670 --> 07:02.940
WITH YOU TODAY,
HOMER.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.270
WHAT?

07:04.340 --> 07:05.710
YEAH, YOU WERE GREAT.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.210
MM-HMM.

07:07.270 --> 07:10.130
YOU EMBARRASSED US
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE
CONGREGATION.

07:10.210 --> 07:13.610
AND TODAY'S SERMON IS ONE YOU
SHOULD'VE REALLY LISTENED TO.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.650
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

07:14.710 --> 07:16.440
- GAMBLING.
- OH.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
HE DIDN'T
BY ANY CHANCE SAY THAT UNDER
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

07:18.580 --> 07:20.280
IT WAS ALL RIGHT, DID HE?

07:20.350 --> 07:23.520
NO! LOOK, I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT THIS ANY MORE
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.560
LISA, BART...

07:25.620 --> 07:27.750
WHAT DID YOU TWO LEARN
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.930
THE ANSWERS TO DEEP
THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.400
YEAH, AMONG OTHER THINGS

07:31.460 --> 07:33.420
APES CAN'T
GET INTO HEAVEN.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.100
WHAT? THOSE CUTE
LITTLE MONKEYS?

07:35.170 --> 07:36.200
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

07:36.270 --> 07:37.310
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

07:37.370 --> 07:39.270
OUR TEACHER.

07:39.340 --> 07:42.610
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THEY
WOULDN'T LET IN THOSE WILD
JUNGLE APES.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.470
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SMART ONES
WHO LIVE AMONG US, WHO ROLLER
SKATE

07:46.550 --> 07:48.050
AND SMOKE CIGARS?

07:48.110 --> 07:49.640
OH, COOL, MAN.

NO WAY, JOSE.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.880

I KNOW WHAT THOSE MOVIES
ARE LIKE.

A LOT OF BAD IDEAS.

CAN I HAVE FIVE BUCKS?

08:06.600 --> 08:09.940
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
TO SEE A CERTAIN MOVIE

I ALWAYS SAY.

DIDN'T HURT.

08:46.870 --> 08:47.810
OH, YEAH?

08:47.870 --> 08:48.970
DO IT AGAIN.

NAH, I MIGHT LAND ON MY FACE
AND END UP

YOU LITTLE PUNK!

08:53.680 --> 08:55.320

YOU DON'T NEED AN INTRODUCTION.
YOU'RE THE WORST KID IN SCHOOL.

THANKS.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.600
PSST, COAST IS CLEAR.

YOU GUYS ARE SNEAKING IN?

TO SEE MOVIES.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.340

HOW IMPORTANT IS IT
TO BE POPULAR?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.200

OUR MINDS TO IT.

16:17.370 --> 16:18.880
<i>JUST A STATUE?</i>

16:18.940 --> 16:20.880
IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY

IS THE LEANING TOWER OF PIZZA
JUST A STATUE?

IT WOULD BE COOL

17:22.300 --> 17:26.200
TO CUT OFF THE HEAD
AND REALLY CHEESE EVERYBODY OFF?

17:26.270 --> 17:28.440
THAT WAS JUST CLOUD TALK, MAN.

17:28.510 --> 17:33.620
THROWIN' ROCKS IS ONE THING.
BUT I WOULD NEVER CUT THE HEAD
OFF OF A GUY WHO ICED A BEAR

17:33.680 --> 17:35.150
WITH HIS BARE HANDS.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.420

Jebediah's voice:
<i>LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.</i>

17:52.700 --> 17:55.070

18:02.180 --> 18:03.810
<i>OH, I AM, AM I?</i>

18:24.430 --> 18:28.040
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH
KRUSTY THE CLOWN?

18:28.100 --> 18:31.370
There's someone in Krustyland
who has committed an atrocity.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.610
If you know who cut off
Jebediah's head--

18:34.680 --> 18:38.080
I don't care if it's
your brother, your sister,
your daddy or mommy--

18:38.150 --> 18:39.550

18:39.610 --> 18:41.910

19:23.320 --> 19:26.090
Along the way,
he met a ferocious bear

19:26.160 --> 19:28.700
and killed him
with his bare hands.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.060
That's b-a-r-e hands.

19:30.130 --> 19:32.200
Modern historians
recently uncovered evidence

that the bear, in fact,
probably killed him.

19:44.910 --> 19:48.340
BECAUSE I WANTED SOME
REALLY BAD KIDS TO LIKE ME.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.850
SOMEHOW,
I GOT THE IDEA
THAT BEING POPULAR

19:50.920 --> 19:53.560
WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.890
WHERE DID YOU GET
A RIDICULOUS IDEA LIKE THAT?

19:56.960 --> 19:59.200
LAY OFF THE BOY, MARGE.

19:59.260 --> 20:02.370
HE'S A GOOD KID.
QUIT GIVING HIM
THE THIRD DEGREE.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.070
( <i>groans )
HOMER, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING</i>

20:04.130 --> 20:05.400
TO DO WITH THIS?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.940
MAYBE I AM
A LITTLE RESPONSIBLE.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.330
A LITTLE?

20:09.400 --> 20:13.870
SON, LET'S TAKE THE HEAD
BACK TO THE AUTHORITIES.

20:13.940 --> 20:17.080
BART, WHEN I
WAS YOUR AGE

20:17.150 --> 20:19.020
I PULLED
A FEW BONERS.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.580
BUT YOU'LL FIND

20:20.650 --> 20:22.420
THAT PEOPLE
ARE PRETTY DECENT

20:22.480 --> 20:23.980
IF YOU GIVE THEM HALF...

20:24.050 --> 20:25.420
LOOK, THERE IT IS.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.660
THE HEAD.
KILL 'EM!

20:27.720 --> 20:29.390
( <i>screaming )</i>

20:36.330 --> 20:37.900
Krusty:
<i>ALL RIGHT!</i>

20:37.970 --> 20:39.270
<i>WE KNOW THIS PART!</i>

20:39.330 --> 20:41.500
Bart:
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.470
THAT'S MY STORY.

20:43.540 --> 20:47.210
IF YOU STILL WANT TO TEAR APART
THIS YOUNG SUNDAY-SCHOOL STUDENT

20:47.280 --> 20:50.010
AS HE STANDS
ON THE BRINK OF SALVATION

20:50.080 --> 20:51.920
I AWAIT YOUR WRATH.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.350
All:
AWWWW.

20:53.410 --> 20:56.440
SOMEHOW I DON'T FEEL
LIKE KILLING ANYMORE.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.850
NEITHER DO I.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.460
DAD.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.650
FORGIVE ME, SIR.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.580
<i>NO PROBLEM, BART.</i>

21:06.360 --> 21:07.530
LOOK, IT'S GLORIOUS!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.170
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.770
I LOVE YOU, SMITHERS.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.040
THE FEELING
IS MORE THAN MUTUAL.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.040
( <i>cheering )</i>

21:15.270 --> 21:17.370
WOO.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.740
GOOD GOING, SON.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.850
BUT REMEMBER-- MOST LYNCH MOBS
AREN'T THIS NICE.
