00:21.188 --> 00:24.256
All right, Anna,
comedy or tragedy?

00:24.291 --> 00:25.290
Comedy!

00:25.326 --> 00:27.526
Laughter is always
preferable to tears...

00:27.561 --> 00:29.361
Unless it is
tears from laughter,

00:29.397 --> 00:31.330
which I also enjoy.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.866
If we can hear it
over your new neighbors

00:33.901 --> 00:36.168
and their endless
mariachi celebration.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.604
I know, it's been
non-stop with those people

00:38.639 --> 00:39.638
ever since they moved in.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.007
Music is to be enjoyed.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.643
Not to be audible
from outer space.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.379
That is so loud.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.314
Right?

00:50.351 --> 00:52.384
Oh, but even still,

00:52.420 --> 00:53.585
I love your
weekend visits.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.854
I wish that you didn't
have to go back so soon.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.624
I know,
but my batteries are recharged,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.059
and I've got to go
back to my real life

01:00.094 --> 01:01.794
and get my firm off the ground.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.429
Well, I'm proud of you,

01:03.464 --> 01:06.031
because it's not every day
a lawyer chooses integrity

01:06.067 --> 01:08.000
over a paycheck!

01:08.035 --> 01:09.301
Oh, well,
don't congratulate me yet.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.270
I may have to go crawling back
to a big firm

01:11.305 --> 01:13.172
if I can't get
my own off the ground.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.206
Stop it.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.741
You are smart
and capable

01:15.776 --> 01:16.842
and determined.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.410
And I take
full credit for that

01:18.446 --> 01:19.645
because that's the way
I raised you!

01:19.680 --> 01:20.612
What?

01:21.816 --> 01:23.182
That's it,
this is ridiculous.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.183
What?

01:24.218 --> 01:25.451
Let's go!

01:25.486 --> 01:26.785
I have to
meet them sometime!

01:26.821 --> 01:27.853
Okay!

01:28.823 --> 01:30.656
Just be careful.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.691
We don't want some
hatfields and mccoys feud

01:32.726 --> 01:33.859
with the new neighbors.

01:33.894 --> 01:34.827
Well, I hope not,

01:34.862 --> 01:36.228
because the hatfields
killed the mccoys.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.496
It wasn't over
mariachi music,

01:37.531 --> 01:38.530
so I think we're safe.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.365
But, just in case,
I'm your backup.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.800
You're always
looking out for me.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.440
Ah, my, my.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.175
Yes, yes.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.011
Wait, you're
our new neighbor?

01:53.047 --> 01:54.346
You're Sean castleberry!

01:54.381 --> 01:56.949
That's what it says
on my driver's license,

01:56.984 --> 01:58.150
it must be true.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.152
Don't believe
the date of birth part.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.653
I'm really
much younger than that.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.289
Could you turn
that down, please?

02:06.594 --> 02:08.759
Wireless speakers.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.628
So, you heard I was in town
making a movie,

02:10.663 --> 02:12.364
and you've come by
for a selfie, right?

02:12.399 --> 02:13.332
Not exactly.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.399
No?

02:14.435 --> 02:15.767
We're here to remind you
that you have neighbors.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.302
There are other people
in the world.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.270
Ah.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.172
Got it, yes.
My music.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.306
Please accept my apologies.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.310
Hey!

02:38.092 --> 02:40.259
Is that darn music
still too loud?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.693
Actually, it was
even louder than before.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.862
Well, I've never been
into salsa music,

02:43.898 --> 02:44.930
but I'm playing
a dance instructor

02:44.965 --> 02:46.231
in this new movie,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.667
and I'm just getting it
all in my head now.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.636
I love it.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.838
How do you like
my moves?

02:52.873 --> 02:53.839
Spectacular.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.607
Best I've ever seen.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.244
Now, would you mind
keeping it to a dull roar?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.646
I know, you're upset

03:00.681 --> 03:02.314
because I haven't
come next door

03:02.349 --> 03:03.815
to introduce myself.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.318
It's just that I'm in Seattle
for a very short time.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.387
Much as we'll all
miss you when you're gone,

03:08.422 --> 03:09.354
might I suggest
you invest

03:09.390 --> 03:10.455
in a pair of headphones?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.160
Have a nice night...

03:15.196 --> 03:17.462
Nice neighbors!

03:18.465 --> 03:20.098
Nice ladies...

03:24.371 --> 03:26.205
Unbelievable!

03:28.542 --> 03:30.175
Who does he think he is?

03:43.290 --> 03:44.456
Okay, aunt belle,

03:44.491 --> 03:47.192
this is my third message
in the past two days.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.594
Where are you?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.729
I'm walking into
my new office now,

03:50.764 --> 03:54.066
so call me there, okay?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.935
I left the new number
on my last few voicemails.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.103
I'll talk to you soon.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.805
Okay, bye.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.806
Where is she?

04:01.976 --> 04:03.208
Look, Mrs. o'healey...

04:03.244 --> 04:04.643
Gloria.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.677
I understand,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.212
this is
a very difficult time for you,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.615
but I've handled
many sensitive divorces,

04:09.650 --> 04:12.517
and I'm going to make this
as painless as possible.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.053
I'm here for you 24/7, okay?

04:15.089 --> 04:17.656
I will call you as soon as
I speak to his lawyer.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.824
All right, you too.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.392
Okay, bye-bye.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.895
Is Gloria
signing with us?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.097
She is.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.231
Poor thing,

04:26.267 --> 04:27.499
this is really rough on her.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.334
I'm going to have to do
a little hand-holding here.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.170
She could've chosen any firm
and she chose you.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.472
It's a testament
to your reputation.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.640
It's a start.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.141
It's a great start.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.442
Wealthy doctor's
soon-to-be ex?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.411
She'll keep us afloat
for a while.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.079
That's not why we do this, em.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.882
Can you get me the file

04:43.917 --> 04:44.916
for the Avery divorce?

04:44.952 --> 04:47.886
You know, Anna,
it's after 6:00, so...

04:47.921 --> 04:50.255
We should go home,

04:50.291 --> 04:52.224
because that's what
normal people do.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.660
They work
and they leave said work.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.061
It's after 6:00 already?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.796
I'm calling
my aunt again.

04:57.831 --> 04:58.864
Your aunt is allowed
to have a life,

04:58.899 --> 04:59.931
unlike the rest of us.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.999
I know that.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.734
But she's usually so quick
to return my calls,

05:02.770 --> 05:03.835
I'm starting to worry.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.870
What if something
happened?

05:04.905 --> 05:05.904
Nothing has happened.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.172
I can't find
the Avery file.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.173
Who packed these boxes?

05:08.208 --> 05:09.608
You did.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.676
When I was home
last month.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.511
Well, I am so fired,
I should probably leave.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.691
Ah, finally!

05:25.726 --> 05:27.993
I was so worried.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.994
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

05:29.029 --> 05:30.128
<i>I was actually out of town</i>

05:30.164 --> 05:31.363
<i>and I forgot to bring</i>
<i>my phone with me.</i>

05:31.398 --> 05:33.865
<i>I didn't even get</i>
<i>your messages until right now.</i>

05:33.901 --> 05:35.467
It's okay, you're forgiven.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.968
I'm just so glad
you're all right.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.103
<i>Did you go camping?</i>

05:38.138 --> 05:41.039
No, I was at
an incredible spa resort.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.474
<i>With a friend.</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:43.442
Really?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.677
With a man friend, perhaps?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.513
Yes, he is all that.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.716
Aunt belle!

05:50.751 --> 05:52.084
<i>This is great news.</i>

05:52.119 --> 05:54.419
<i>It's been two years</i>
<i>since you and Walter broke up,</i>

05:54.455 --> 05:55.420
<i>i didn't know</i>
<i>you were dating again.</i>

05:55.456 --> 06:00.425
Well, it's actually
a bit more than dating.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.361
<i>Wait...</i>

06:03.764 --> 06:04.696
I'm engaged!

06:04.732 --> 06:05.931
<i>What? To who?</i>

06:05.966 --> 06:07.699
To whom?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.867
Are you really
correcting my grammar

06:08.902 --> 06:09.968
at a time like this?

06:10.003 --> 06:12.537
<i>Anna, there is never</i>
<i>a good time</i>

06:12.573 --> 06:13.538
<i>for improper grammar.</i>

06:13.574 --> 06:14.773
Okay, well then,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.575
to whom
are you getting married?

06:17.711 --> 06:18.677
Sean castleberry.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.880
That's great, I just,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.515
I really hope it's not
on the same day

06:23.550 --> 06:24.916
as my wedding to Bradley Cooper.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.518
<i>I'm not joking, honey.</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:28.420
<i>Wait, seriously?</i>

06:28.455 --> 06:30.355
<i>A month ago, you hated him,</i>

06:30.391 --> 06:32.391
<i>and now you're marrying</i>
<i>this guy?</i>

06:32.426 --> 06:34.226
<i>And he's been married</i>
<i>so many times.</i>

06:34.261 --> 06:35.460
<i>I mean, does he get</i>
<i>a set of steak knives</i>

06:35.496 --> 06:37.062
<i>on the 10th wife?</i>

06:37.097 --> 06:38.029
<i>Well, I could certainly use</i>

06:38.065 --> 06:39.631
<i>a new set of steak knives,</i>

06:39.666 --> 06:42.100
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>it works that way.</i>

06:42.136 --> 06:44.002
<i>Hello, Anna.</i>

06:44.037 --> 06:46.004
<i>Hi, Mr. castleberry.</i>

06:46.039 --> 06:47.005
<i>You're there.</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:49.207
<i>That... that's really great.</i>

06:49.243 --> 06:50.776
Please. Sean.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.878
And it's not
10 marriages, Anna,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.579
it's only three.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.449
Sometimes, in life,
you have to kiss a few frogs.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.884
But that's all
behind me now,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.786
ever since I met this woman
I'm so crazy about.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.054
When did this happen?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.356
<i>Well, we've been</i>
<i>seeing each other</i>

07:04.391 --> 07:05.357
<i>since you left,</i>

07:05.392 --> 07:06.558
<i>and I didn't mention it</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:09.728
because I wanted to make sure
it was real first.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.230
<i>Nothing has</i>
<i>ever been more real.</i>

07:13.400 --> 07:15.700
<i>I said that line</i>
<i>in a soap opera once.</i>

07:17.037 --> 07:18.537
<i>Of course you did.</i>

07:18.572 --> 07:21.339
Uh, um, oh, uh, darling,

07:21.375 --> 07:22.607
there's just
one more thing...

07:22.643 --> 07:24.976
<i>The wedding is going to be</i>
<i>in two weeks.</i>

07:25.012 --> 07:26.511
<i>What? W-why?</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:28.346
<i>Why is the wedding in two weeks?</i>

07:28.382 --> 07:29.781
<i>That's very soon.</i>

07:29.817 --> 07:30.949
<i>Well, I'm shooting a movie.</i>

07:30.984 --> 07:31.983
<i>As soon as I finish,</i>

07:32.019 --> 07:34.186
<i>i can't wait to start</i>
<i>my new life</i>

07:34.221 --> 07:36.688
<i>with your wonderful aunt.</i>

07:36.723 --> 07:38.523
<i>Or is it "ah-nt".</i>

07:38.559 --> 07:39.891
<i>Ah, tomato, tom-ah-to.</i>

07:39.927 --> 07:41.426
<i>This is our first fight,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

07:42.529 --> 07:43.462
<i>We'll get through it,</i>
<i>i know we will.</i>

07:43.497 --> 07:46.031
Um... honey.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.400
I-I really hope
you can get away.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.868
I want you to be
my maid of honor.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.371
<i>Oh, trust me, I will be there,</i>

07:53.407 --> 07:56.708
<i>and I will see you very soon.</i>

07:56.743 --> 07:58.977
<i>Bye!</i>

08:01.281 --> 08:03.181
Wow.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.724
Keep a close eye
on her blood pressure

08:12.759 --> 08:15.160
and notify me of any changes
in either direction.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.797
Jake called.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.167
Well, that's never a good sign,

08:22.202 --> 08:23.768
hearing from my dad's
assistant, is it?

08:23.804 --> 08:24.769
Nope.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.804
Do you want me
to get him on the line?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.506
Mm-hmm.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.609
Nice to
see you again.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.448
What?

08:36.482 --> 08:40.251
In two weeks,
they say, "I do."

08:40.287 --> 08:41.453
<i>He never learns.</i>

08:41.488 --> 08:43.455
Especially after the last wife
did a number on him

08:43.490 --> 08:44.556
and his bank account.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.892
Well, you want him
to be happy, don't you?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.059
<i>Yeah, of course, Jake,</i>

08:48.095 --> 08:49.361
I'm not a monster,

08:49.396 --> 08:50.829
but why does he have to
marry them

08:50.864 --> 08:51.997
<i>every single time?</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:53.098
A hopeless romantic?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.233
Yeah, well, thanks
for letting me know.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.635
Again?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.802
Yeah, apparently,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.070
he rented the house next door

08:59.106 --> 09:00.906
to the luckiest gold-digger
in Seattle

09:00.941 --> 09:02.607
while shooting
his movie there.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.742
You're going to Seattle,
aren't you?

09:03.777 --> 09:06.378
What about
the conference?

09:06.413 --> 09:07.679
It was an honor
just to be asked, right?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.314
A huge honor.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.815
I'm sure there's someone else

09:10.851 --> 09:12.183
who can do the keynote

09:12.219 --> 09:14.586
on breakthroughs
in lumbar spinal fusion, right?

09:16.290 --> 09:18.390
I should've known
it was too good to be true.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.758
Don't cancel just yet.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.759
Deal with your dad,

09:20.794 --> 09:22.561
and then get a flight
to Miami from there.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.595
You can still make

09:23.630 --> 09:25.230
some of
the conference.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.431
And the best
part of the trip,

09:26.466 --> 09:29.067
a few relaxing days
on the beach.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.269
He always does this
at the worst possible times.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.871
What do you want me to do?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.339
Book me a flight to Seattle.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.007
A.S.A.P.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.677
Thank you.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.713
And I will be accessible
at any time,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.648
so make sure every client
has my cell phone number,

09:43.684 --> 09:44.716
especially Gloria.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.051
And did you reschedule
the foster arbitration?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.085
Done.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.954
And did aunt Suzie call?
Is she picking me up?

09:48.989 --> 09:49.955
She's meeting you
at the curb.

09:49.990 --> 09:50.989
How long
will you be gone?

09:51.024 --> 09:52.424
Hopefully,
a few days, tops.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.225
This is not a good time
for me to be away,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.728
but I will get this nonsense
under control

09:56.763 --> 09:58.597
and head back.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.533
That word rears its ugly head.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.500
What word, "nonsense?"

10:02.536 --> 10:03.468
No, "control."

10:03.503 --> 10:05.937
You cannot control
everything, Anna.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.439
It's not about
control, em,

10:07.474 --> 10:08.506
it's about protection.

10:08.542 --> 10:09.975
He's a movie star.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.776
He dates glamorous
Hollywood types.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.878
What does he want
with a retired art teacher

10:13.914 --> 10:14.980
from Seattle?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.147
Maybe it's love.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.215
No, it's not love,
I've met him.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.183
He's a slick one.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.651
That type of charm is dangerous.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.987
I've got to figure out
what's really going on.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.655
I'm not going to let my aunt
be another notch in his belt,

10:23.690 --> 10:25.056
which I'm sure is Gucci.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.558
It's fine,

10:26.593 --> 10:27.559
I will work while I'm gone.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.560
I have this under con...

10:29.529 --> 10:30.795
It's fine.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.796
This is family.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.235
<i>Boarding pass</i>

10:37.270 --> 10:38.737
and itinerary.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.238
Just for
the wrong location.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.074
Oh, I haven't given up
on that conference just yet.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.144
Do you know, it's been
more than 20 years

10:46.179 --> 10:47.212
since my mom died,

10:47.247 --> 10:48.880
and he keeps finding
these women.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.248
You know, sure,
they seem great at first.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.950
They're beautiful,
and funny, and smart,

10:51.985 --> 10:54.119
and then, bam, they hit you
right in the wallet.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.221
Are you talking about
your dad's experience

10:56.256 --> 10:57.222
or your own?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.256
Both.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.758
But I've learned
from my mistakes.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.226
He never does.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.062
What is it
that he's searching for?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.798
If only I could
figure that out.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.866
Oh, passion?

11:07.901 --> 11:11.036
Love?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.505
What everybody
wants.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.773
Annabelle Colton,

11:14.808 --> 11:17.809
north Seattle high,
class of 2002.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.210
Cheerleader,

11:19.246 --> 11:20.712
captain of
the debate team.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.680
This has to be her.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.681
It's right where
he rented the house.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.583
Ah-hah.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.119
And this is her today.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.288
Annabelle,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.257
a.K.A. Belle.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.258
Beautiful, young,

11:33.293 --> 11:35.260
and probably looking
to land a windfall.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.264
But she is in
for a rude awakening.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.169
I know, Gloria, but you have
nothing to worry about.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.538
I am in constant contact
with his lawyer.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.539
What can I say...

11:47.574 --> 11:48.506
Oh!

11:48.542 --> 11:49.808
I'm going to
have to call you back.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.077
Great, phone's dead.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.045
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
Well, the same could be
said for you.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.550
Don't text and walk,
isn't that what people say?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.552
Oh, I'm sorry,
I must've missed that p.S.A.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.686
It doesn't matter anyway,

12:01.722 --> 12:03.088
since you've killed
my phone.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.222
I killed your phone?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.390
You killed my shirt.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.258
My favorite shirt.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.660
That's your favorite shirt?

12:08.695 --> 12:11.362
Doesn't even look like
a contender for "favorite."

12:11.398 --> 12:12.464
I think you could do better.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.465
Well, it's much nicer

12:13.500 --> 12:14.966
when it's not covered
in caramel macchiato.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.035
Yeah, well, so is my blazer.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.236
Have we met?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.004
No, I don't think so.
I think I'd remember you.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.307
Did you just come in
on the flight from Boston?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.308
San Francisco.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.310
Huh...

12:26.313 --> 12:27.245
So, what are you going
to do about my phone?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.480
What are you going
to do about my shirt?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.014
You going to
have it dry cleaned?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.950
You know what, I would,
but my ride just got here.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.051
Put some
club soda on it.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.352
Problem solved.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.987
Stick your phone in some rice,
problem solved.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.889
Wish I could say
it was a pleasure.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.290
Yeah, it wasn't.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.465
Have a nice day!

12:55.041 --> 12:56.274
Thanks for
picking me up, Jake,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.376
since my dad still
won't answer any of my calls.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.779
What, he has to have you tell me
all this big news now?

13:00.814 --> 13:01.946
He can't even
tell me himself?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.949
Well, maybe he knew you'd try
to talk him out of it.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.718
Besides, I've gotten very good
at dropping bombshells

13:06.753 --> 13:08.987
after two decades
of working for your father.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.421
It's on my resume now.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.990
Two wives
in the last five years,

13:12.025 --> 13:13.591
and I'm supposed to, what,
just congratulate him?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.593
Belle is different.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.662
Oh-ho, yeah,
I'm sure she is, Jake.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.264
They all are.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.565
They don't care
that he's a movie star, no.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.367
No, they would love him
just the same

13:22.402 --> 13:23.668
if he were a bank teller.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.669
Please, I've heard it
all before.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.070
Well, just try
to reserve judgment

13:26.106 --> 13:27.372
until after you've met her,

13:27.407 --> 13:28.439
will you?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.608
I think she's going
to surprise you.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.311
Yeah, I think not.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.445
I can't believe

13:34.481 --> 13:36.514
you're being so blase
about all this.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.016
Well, it's her time, Anna.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.351
It's a little bit later
than most people,

13:40.387 --> 13:43.054
but everybody deserves
to find their great love.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.056
And sometimes, you just
need to let people

13:45.091 --> 13:46.291
make their own
mistakes.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.792
Because they don't
listen to you anyway

13:47.828 --> 13:49.060
when they are so sure

13:49.095 --> 13:50.895
that they are ready
to tie the knot.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.063
I can't believe
you're going to throw

13:52.098 --> 13:53.398
the biggest mistake of my life
in my face

13:53.433 --> 13:54.966
at a time like this.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.067
I was 19.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.402
I was young and stupid,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.838
and I have been careful
about my decisions ever since.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.272
What's belle's
excuse?

14:01.308 --> 14:03.141
She doesn't need one.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.442
Sean's the best.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.443
We all adore him.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.546
What about his history,
aunt Suzie?

14:08.582 --> 14:10.181
No, that's the tabloid Sean.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.650
Trust me, you get to know him,
he's completely different.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.186
Plus, he's introducing me
to George Clooney

14:15.222 --> 14:16.487
at the wedding.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.822
I just...

14:17.858 --> 14:21.759
I'm just glad
dad's not here to see all this.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.928
He was so protective
of you and aunt belle.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.929
What would he say

14:24.965 --> 14:27.031
about his sister marrying
a virtual stranger?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.734
I'm not certain,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.903
but I think he'd say,
"you go, girl."

14:38.478 --> 14:39.644
Aunt belle?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.881
She knew I was
coming home today.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.085
Well, it looks like
she had other plans.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.753
Salsa?

14:48.788 --> 14:51.155
I hope she's talking
about chips and dip.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.590
She hates dancing.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.159
He's pulled her to
the dark side, aunt Suzie.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.494
I have to go
and open the shop,

14:56.529 --> 14:57.862
so I can't wait with you,

14:57.898 --> 15:00.131
but try to keep
an open mind.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.902
I'm telling you,
my sister is a new woman.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.403
Salsa?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.243
Our best leverage is the fact

15:12.279 --> 15:14.012
that you helped put your husband
through medical school.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.980
California is
a community property state,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.416
so you have absolutely nothing
to worry about here.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.819
Okay, um, we will talk later.

15:32.032 --> 15:32.964
What?

15:32.999 --> 15:34.165
How...

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
How on earth
did you find me here?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.969
Is this about
your phone?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.040
You, um, looked very different
out of context.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.841
That's why I couldn't place you.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.076
I see you've changed.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.311
It's much, much better.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.312
This should, uh,

15:47.347 --> 15:49.213
this should really
be your favorite.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.016
Clay.
Clay castleberry.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.585
Sean's son.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.820
That figures.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.655
And you're Annabelle Colton.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.691
Your father isn't here.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.260
Actually, I didn't come here
to see my father,

16:02.295 --> 16:03.261
I came here to see you.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.729
Oh, great,
just let yourself in.

16:04.764 --> 16:05.730
Yeah.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.231
I mean, if you're going
to marry my father,

16:07.267 --> 16:08.633
I thought we might as well
get acquainted,

16:08.668 --> 16:09.634
alone.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.070
Right, belle?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.405
Of course.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.473
So...

16:15.508 --> 16:16.541
How much?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.176
Excuse me?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.177
Look, I'm sure

16:19.212 --> 16:20.178
you're a perfectly nice
person, Annabelle,

16:20.213 --> 16:21.980
but everyone has a price.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.381
What are you talking about?

16:23.416 --> 16:24.782
Look, let's just save my father

16:24.818 --> 16:26.951
another long
and painful divorce.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.019
How much is it going to take

16:28.054 --> 16:30.688
to, uh, call off
the engagement?

16:31.891 --> 16:34.892
Wow, that is
quite an offer, Clay.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.996
You know, I really,
truly don't know.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.430
I'm gonna have to
do some math here,

16:39.466 --> 16:40.631
figure out
a good price...

16:43.069 --> 16:44.035
Anna!

16:44.070 --> 16:45.503
Clay, you're here!

16:45.538 --> 16:47.372
You're looking well.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.373
- Hi, dad.
- Good to see you.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.607
Looking good.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.675
I see you've met
belle's niece,

16:50.710 --> 16:51.776
Anna.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.113
So lovely to
see you again.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.314
And this, of course,
is the love of my life,

16:56.349 --> 16:57.348
Ms. belle Colton.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.617
Belle, and...

16:59.652 --> 17:01.085
Annabelle.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.220
Yes.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.287
Her father was
my big brother,

17:03.323 --> 17:04.789
and we were very close,

17:04.824 --> 17:06.257
so Anna was named after me.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.224
Very close.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.226
She raised me.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.861
I would do anything for her.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.030
It is so nice
to meet you, Clay.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.830
Your father
raves about you.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.134
I also rave
about anchovies.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.769
Don't let it go
to your head.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.569
You guys seem like
you are a lot alike.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.805
We were just getting
acquainted

17:20.839 --> 17:21.873
when you walked in.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.074
He's special.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.876
Well, it's
a nice day,

17:24.911 --> 17:27.412
why don't we all
go next door to my place

17:27.446 --> 17:28.546
and fire up
the barbecue?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.547
It'd give us a chance

17:29.582 --> 17:30.515
to get to know
each other better.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.616
Sounds good.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.750
Great, I'll get
some food together,

17:32.786 --> 17:34.318
and we'll meet you
next door.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.087
See you later, Clay.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.288
Yeah.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.322
Remember that
commercial I did

17:38.358 --> 17:39.524
for the grill?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.958
How could I forget?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.960
That was a pretty
good grill...

17:44.030 --> 17:46.397
I picked up some
burgers yesterday.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.832
You know, Anna,

17:47.867 --> 17:49.434
you are going to
adore Sean

17:49.469 --> 17:50.835
once you get
to know him.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.236
Everyone does.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.138
You didn't at first.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.074
How can you possibly
know him in one month?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.909
I know everything
I need to know.

17:57.944 --> 17:58.876
Come on...

17:58.912 --> 17:59.877
I'll tell you one thing,

17:59.913 --> 18:02.947
she's got the kindest
heart I've ever met.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.917
Kind of reminds me
of your mother.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.885
Look, I'm sure
she's very nice,

18:07.921 --> 18:09.387
and I get
that you like her,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.255
but why rush things?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.523
Like we said before
on the phone,

18:12.559 --> 18:14.826
Sean's movie finishes
in a few days,

18:14.861 --> 18:16.694
and we just can't wait
to start our life together.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.630
Are you sure you don't want to
think this through

18:19.666 --> 18:20.631
a little more?

18:20.667 --> 18:23.034
I would just hate
to see you get hurt.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.836
Sean would never hurt me.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.207
I would never
hurt her.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.374
I'm worried about you.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.876
Remember
what happened with...

18:33.012 --> 18:34.278
That name that
can't be said.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.648
Okay, well, you were
so sure about...

18:37.684 --> 18:38.649
Yeah, yeah.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.650
...her.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.718
And look what happened,
she destroyed you.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.553
I just don't want to see
that happen to you again.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.021
I appreciate that,
thank you,

18:44.057 --> 18:46.057
but this time,

18:46.092 --> 18:47.391
slam dunk.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.359
Right here.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.197
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.398
Can I take
something?

18:54.434 --> 18:55.666
Sure.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.734
Great.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.003
Why didn't you
tell me who you were?

18:59.038 --> 19:00.138
Oh, I didn't
really have time.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.639
You were so busy
negotiating your bribe.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.608
It wasn't a bribe,
it was an offer.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.911
I don't know what circles
you run in, Clay,

19:06.946 --> 19:08.479
but my aunt
cannot be bought.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.514
They're not
my circles.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.748
They're my father's.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.116
Well, I'm not going to
allow your father,

19:12.152 --> 19:13.985
and his very obvious
mid-life crisis

19:14.020 --> 19:15.386
to take advantage of my aunt.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.054
Him take advantage of her?

19:17.090 --> 19:18.122
That's not normally the case

19:18.158 --> 19:19.290
where the castleberrys
are concerned.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.758
My aunt could care less

19:20.793 --> 19:22.226
about any of that
celebrity stuff.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.162
Look, I'm sure
she's a very wonderful person,

19:24.197 --> 19:26.464
and I imagine they think
that this is true love.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.299
It's not. It's adrenaline,
disguised as love.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.367
I'm a divorce lawyer,

19:29.402 --> 19:30.902
I've seen this
a million times.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.336
Hi.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.404
Hello, I'm Jake.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.372
This is Anna.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.373
I'm Anna.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.340
It's nice to meet
you, Anna.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.608
Will you both
be joining us?

19:37.644 --> 19:39.443
Yes. Very soon.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.246
They need to
put on the brakes.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.214
Get to know
each other,

19:43.249 --> 19:45.049
see if they fit into
each other's lives.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.050
Then, a few months
down the road...

19:46.085 --> 19:47.051
If they're still
together...

19:47.086 --> 19:48.019
If they're
still together,

19:48.054 --> 19:50.388
see what happens.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.356
They can't get
married in two weeks.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.858
It's an absolute
recipe for disaster.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.695
So we stop the wedding?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.063
We have no choice.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.674
So, counselor,
what's the plan?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.175
I'm supposed to
come up with a plan?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.110
Well, you seem like
the sort of person

20:13.146 --> 20:14.512
who always has a plan.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.981
I've never been in
this position before.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.182
You, however, have.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.350
What do you think?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.451
Well, you kind of
squashed it this morning.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.287
That was your plan?

20:23.323 --> 20:24.255
That wasn't a plan,

20:24.290 --> 20:25.957
that was
an act of desperation.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.025
Pardon me for my lack
of experience here,

20:28.061 --> 20:30.194
but I didn't step in
early enough last time,

20:30.230 --> 20:32.396
and I'm not okay
with a repeat performance.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.966
Gail, his former wife,
was a demonic human being...

20:35.001 --> 20:36.100
Though to call her a human

20:36.135 --> 20:37.101
is an insult to humans
everywhere, trust me.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.003
Well, I can assure you,

20:39.038 --> 20:41.472
my aunt is nothing
like that.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.506
I get it. She's a dream,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.041
but it still doesn't
dismiss the fact

20:44.077 --> 20:45.343
that this is insane...

20:45.378 --> 20:47.278
...and then, I did my surgical
residency in Boston

20:47.313 --> 20:48.346
and I never left.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.580
Boston, oh,
how fascinating...

20:49.616 --> 20:50.748
Clay, how do you
take your burgers?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.383
Uh, medium, please.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.087
Look, we need to
figure this out soon,

20:56.122 --> 20:58.489
because I left a very
important new client behind,

20:58.524 --> 20:59.590
and I need to get back.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.293
Mm-hmm, and I'm supposed
to be in Miami on Friday,

21:02.328 --> 21:03.294
doing my first keynote

21:03.329 --> 21:05.596
to a conference of
prominent orthopedists.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.399
We're all sacrificing
something here.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.235
Look at them...

21:11.271 --> 21:12.336
They look like
teenagers.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.938
Here, I'm going to
take this.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.206
I'm going to
save you with this.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.642
You know, some pre-marital
appetizers are okay...

21:19.746 --> 21:20.678
You know what this is?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.712
Hmm?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.481
It's a vacation romance.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.350
Yeah, well,
vacations always end.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.519
You know that,
and I know that,

21:28.554 --> 21:30.321
we just need to
get them to see

21:30.356 --> 21:31.822
that this is not
real life.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.859
So I'm up for
the role of a lifetime,

21:34.894 --> 21:36.327
this is about 30 years ago.

21:36.362 --> 21:37.461
It's James Bond.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.730
Between Roger Moore
and Timothy Dalton,

21:39.766 --> 21:41.299
and they're seeing
everybody in town,

21:41.334 --> 21:43.034
but I'm the only non-brit.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.035
So I figure,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.069
I gotta work on
this accent.

21:45.104 --> 21:48.005
I hire a dialect coach,
the best guy in town.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.040
I'm pumped,
we're ready,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.508
I've been
working on this.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.910
It's the money shot,
audition day, I'm there,

21:52.945 --> 21:55.079
the director says,
"action!"

21:56.115 --> 21:57.081
"Bond.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.749
James Bond."

21:59.786 --> 22:02.887
Hey says, "cut.
Please, cut!"

22:04.190 --> 22:05.389
I think it serves
them right

22:05.425 --> 22:06.524
for not casting me

22:06.559 --> 22:08.959
that that whole franchise
just tanked after that.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.730
He has such great stories.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.732
I could just
listen for hours.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.134
And he can certainly
talk for hours.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.503
So, how did you
get together?

22:19.539 --> 22:22.239
I tried to
have him arrested.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.008
I warned him
about the music.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.076
Oh, yes.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.945
Ah, but I had
this clever ruse

22:27.980 --> 22:29.246
to get her to
come back over.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.148
When the police
arrived,

22:31.184 --> 22:34.185
they posed for selfies.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.354
She finally gave me
a chance to apologize

22:36.389 --> 22:38.155
and let me
take her to dinner.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.657
Just like a fairy tale.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.991
And you two find

22:41.027 --> 22:42.893
that your lives are
complementary?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.062
I mean, you're from
very different worlds.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.063
True.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.832
I like salty, he likes sweet.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.801
She's an early riser,
I'm a night owl.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.370
I'm farm-to-table,

22:52.405 --> 22:53.371
and he's more...

22:53.406 --> 22:54.405
Room service to bed.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.840
Now, that you could
learn to love.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.408
Give it a chance.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.577
I think that
if people work at it,

22:59.612 --> 23:01.112
and they're meant to be,

23:01.147 --> 23:02.546
they can
make it all happen.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.482
We just want
to settle down,

23:04.517 --> 23:05.516
and buy a ranch,

23:05.551 --> 23:07.318
grow our own vegetables,

23:07.353 --> 23:09.120
and own a few horses.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.322
It's like I told you
when I retired last year,

23:11.357 --> 23:13.023
that that was
always my dream.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.459
I just, um, never thought
it would actually happen.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.660
Okay, hold on,

23:16.696 --> 23:17.962
buy a ranch?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.898
Dad, you loathe getting dirty.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.701
Yes, but the offers
that I get these days

23:23.736 --> 23:25.202
are not all that inspiring.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.538
I think maybe it's time
to hang up the Hollywood hat

23:27.573 --> 23:30.374
and try something
a little simpler.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.477
I am determined
to get some dirt

23:33.513 --> 23:36.547
under your father's
perfectly manicured fingernails.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.715
Not too much,
not too much.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.719
Have you tried being
the outdoorsy type yet?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.621
Without a stunt double?

23:44.791 --> 23:45.723
That was a good one.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.957
I have not,

23:46.993 --> 23:50.094
but I do think that I can
accomplish anything

23:50.129 --> 23:51.429
with belle by my side.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.066
Sure, my dad wants to
hang up his hat

23:56.102 --> 23:57.101
and become grizzly Adams

23:57.136 --> 23:58.102
when the offers
aren't coming in,

23:58.137 --> 24:00.070
but that's just in theory,

24:00.106 --> 24:01.972
not practice.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.074
Wait till belle takes him
out on the hiking trails.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.509
It's like her sanctuary.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.911
She's all business
out there.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.112
Have you seen
her paintings?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.113
No, I haven't,

24:09.148 --> 24:10.815
but that sounds like
torture to my father.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.817
He likes spas

24:12.852 --> 24:13.818
and air conditioning

24:13.853 --> 24:14.819
and indoor plumbing.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.854
He'll hate her life.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.491
Well...

24:20.526 --> 24:21.759
Maybe we should let him see.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.228
He thinks he'll love it.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.496
We could be wrong.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.730
After all,

24:26.766 --> 24:29.066
the great outdoors
are beautiful.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.402
Not to
mention invigorating.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.871
The fresh air
filling your lungs.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.339
All those adorable

24:35.374 --> 24:36.740
little creatures?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.776
So, we're going
hiking tomorrow?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.344
What an excellent idea.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.912
I'm so glad
you thought of it.

24:41.948 --> 24:42.913
Your break.

24:45.284 --> 24:49.053
Three, two, one.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.922
Not bad.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.430
I want that part.
Come on, go get it.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.432
I mean, you know
I'm perfect for it.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.301
It reads like
it was written for me.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.770
Yes, this is
my real hair.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.038
I... you...

25:08.074 --> 25:09.507
Just go get it.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.909
Hey, where are
your hiking boots, Sean?

25:11.944 --> 25:12.877
Oh...

25:12.912 --> 25:14.812
Right here.
Fresh off the rack.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.413
Clay has the rest of
your survival gear.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.482
Always looking out for him.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.450
Well, somebody
has to.

25:19.485 --> 25:20.718
Lucky me.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.754
Well, I guess it's
a perfect day to be hiking.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.289
It's also a perfect day
to be employed.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.657
Please try not
to kill him.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.192
No, no, I'm taking him up

25:28.227 --> 25:30.528
to my favorite place
in the whole world.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.563
Oh, this will be so great.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.999
Yeah, remember
the "don't kill him" part.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.934
Yes, sweetheart.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.903
Isn't it
incredible out here?

25:38.938 --> 25:42.206
"Incredible" is not
the word that comes to mind.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.808
Come on, dad,
we're going to climb that rock.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.644
Come on, Clay,
I'll race you.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.145
Clearly,
you've done this before.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.713
Hey, hey,
we should slow down for them.

25:49.749 --> 25:50.714
We're almost there!

25:50.750 --> 25:54.318
Wait till you see this view!

25:55.521 --> 25:56.854
Wow!

25:56.889 --> 26:00.791
The hills are alive
with the sound of wheezing.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.128
Hey, can we stop
at the sherpa station

26:04.163 --> 26:05.362
and get some help?

26:05.398 --> 26:07.064
It's a killer view
up here, dad.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.134
Don't say, "killer"
at a time like this.

26:12.438 --> 26:13.771
Breathe in
that air.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.341
Crisp, clear, fresh.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.877
Imagine this every
single day of your life..

26:19.912 --> 26:21.779
It's like
living in a dream.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.715
You're endangering
my life here.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.385
He's very dramatic.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.520
He's always
very dramatic, belle.

26:29.555 --> 26:30.721
It's what he's good at.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.657
I don't like heights!

26:33.693 --> 26:35.826
I don't like being
this tall.

26:35.861 --> 26:36.860
Where's the tram?

26:37.863 --> 26:39.830
My kingdom for a funicular!

26:41.734 --> 26:42.900
You're doing great,
sweetheart.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.004
This is going so well.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.672
Maybe I'll make that
conference after all.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.177
Are those seagulls
or vultures?

26:53.212 --> 26:55.379
They're just...
Careful, love!

26:58.618 --> 27:00.551
I want to go home.

27:00.586 --> 27:01.552
You hear that?

27:01.587 --> 27:04.455
That's the sound
of trouble in paradise.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.357
This is more my style.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.425
You're good.
Come on. Get up.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.127
All right, that's off
my bucket list, thank you.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.363
Give me
your hand.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.899
So, counselor,
why divorce?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.434
It's a difficult
time for people,

27:17.470 --> 27:18.902
and I help them
navigate it.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.038
Yeah, I don't know,

27:21.073 --> 27:22.706
the demise of
someone's relationship?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.842
It just seems
so depressing.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.276
See, I prefer putting
people back together.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.878
Well, maybe by
breaking them apart,

27:27.913 --> 27:29.246
I am putting them
back together.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.948
Just individually.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.149
Over here.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.218
You can be alive
and yet be so miserable

27:34.253 --> 27:36.420
that you're not
really living.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.955
People are always
chasing a feeling.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.056
Love puts you
on top of the world,

27:39.091 --> 27:41.825
and then there's
that inevitable crash,

27:41.861 --> 27:42.793
and boom,

27:42.828 --> 27:44.328
you're right back
where you started.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.530
See, and I've found
it's not so much love

27:46.565 --> 27:48.732
as it is convenience,

27:48.768 --> 27:49.800
or opportunity.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.301
How many times
do I have to tell you

27:51.337 --> 27:52.436
my aunt is not like that?

27:52.471 --> 27:53.737
Probably a few more.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.373
But we need
to stop this now,

27:56.409 --> 27:58.475
before they move to L.A.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.277
What do you mean?

28:00.312 --> 28:01.378
Yeah, my dad told me

28:01.414 --> 28:02.946
that they're going to sell
belle's house

28:02.982 --> 28:04.448
and buy a ranch in Malibu.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.916
His movie wraps
tomorrow.

28:05.951 --> 28:07.918
All that's left is them
packing up everything

28:07.953 --> 28:09.053
and then going to live
happily ever after.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.189
I figured she might
go back with him,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.759
but it never occurred to me
that she would sell our house.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.596
Wait, belle's house
is your house?

28:19.632 --> 28:21.598
My mom died
when I was three,

28:21.634 --> 28:23.500
so belle
moved in with us.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.902
Whoa.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.303
That was pretty
selfless of her.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.238
She gave up
so much for me,

28:28.274 --> 28:30.140
which is why I have to
protect her now.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.710
But that was our home.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.311
Well, at least
you had a home.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.948
When your father's
an actor,

28:37.983 --> 28:41.985
home is a series
of random hotel rooms.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.421
What about your mom?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.226
She died
when I was 12.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.294
I'm sorry.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.328
Yeah.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.031
I don't think
he ever got over it.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.232
It is beautiful,
thought, right?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.767
I'll take your word
for that,

28:56.802 --> 28:58.936
and I'll wait
and see the picture.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.307
Home for me is...

29:03.342 --> 29:05.409
Has become the operating room.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.878
In the operating room,
I always know what to do.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.847
I'm in complete control.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.516
People talk about
being in control

29:12.551 --> 29:14.118
like it's some
character flaw.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.552
Right?

29:15.588 --> 29:17.087
As if being reckless

29:17.123 --> 29:19.323
makes life somehow
more worthwhile.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.927
But I don't think that
we have anything to worry

29:23.963 --> 29:25.028
about her moving away.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.029
Look at him.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.966
How you making out
there, dad?

29:29.001 --> 29:31.668
I feel I am near death.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.804
May history
remember me kindly.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.072
Well, you'd better hope

29:35.107 --> 29:36.573
another actor that's
more famous than you

29:36.609 --> 29:37.641
doesn't die
on the same day,

29:37.676 --> 29:38.742
'cause he'll take
top billing.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.712
A fate worse than death!

29:41.747 --> 29:42.746
Come on, you guys,

29:42.782 --> 29:43.781
the tide's low.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.015
I want to
show you something.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.850
Oh, good, there's more.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.787
All right,
come here, I'll pull you.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.655
Come on, dad.

29:51.690 --> 29:54.191
You got this.

29:55.528 --> 29:57.628
Oxygen...

29:57.663 --> 29:58.629
Paramedic.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.197
Come on, old man.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.099
Are you pulling him?
That's great.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.135
There you go.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.103
Break 'em up.

30:06.138 --> 30:10.040
Belle seemed so at ease
on the trail today.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.041
But, uh...

30:11.076 --> 30:13.243
No offense intended,

30:13.279 --> 30:15.779
you have a very limited
outdoor skill set.

30:15.815 --> 30:16.947
Yeah.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.483
You know, that's a long time
for an actor to be outside

30:19.518 --> 30:21.585
with no hair and makeup.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.586
I liked it, though.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.087
I think I'll get
better at it.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.088
You do, huh?

30:25.124 --> 30:26.523
Uh-huh.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.559
Well, I think the two of you
couldn't be any more different.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.560
Well, you've probably heard

30:29.595 --> 30:31.361
that opposites attract.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.497
It wouldn't a bad idea
for you to find somebody

30:33.532 --> 30:35.632
who expands
your horizons.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.467
Hmm.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.403
What about dating?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.538
What was that
last girl's name?

30:41.574 --> 30:43.974
Vivian. And no,
I'm not dating.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.009
A lot of opportunists
out there, dad.

30:46.045 --> 30:46.977
Guys like you and I,

30:47.012 --> 30:47.978
we have to be careful.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.179
Really?

30:49.215 --> 30:52.816
That's kind of
a cynical overview, I think.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.218
Why do you always think

30:54.253 --> 30:55.586
that people have
a hidden agenda?

30:55.621 --> 30:57.087
Well...

30:57.122 --> 30:58.822
Because they usually do.

30:58.858 --> 30:59.823
Oh...

30:59.859 --> 31:01.692
You of all people
should understand that.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.361
Nice shot.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.696
It would be a shame

31:05.731 --> 31:09.266
if a couple of unfortunate
romantic experiences

31:09.301 --> 31:10.334
were to set you back.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.668
I do believe

31:11.704 --> 31:13.570
that there are some
great opportunities

31:13.606 --> 31:14.571
out there

31:14.607 --> 31:16.540
when you just keep
your mind open to it.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.608
Open.

31:17.643 --> 31:18.775
You know, speaking of "open,"

31:18.811 --> 31:20.677
I noticed you don't
open your mail anymore.

31:20.713 --> 31:21.678
Why not?

31:21.714 --> 31:23.981
That's what we have Jake for.

31:24.016 --> 31:24.982
You know, I come into town,

31:25.017 --> 31:26.583
we get all kinds of
nice opportunities,

31:26.619 --> 31:27.584
invitations, uh,

31:27.620 --> 31:30.420
red carpet, black tie...

31:30.456 --> 31:31.421
How does belle feel

31:31.457 --> 31:33.323
about all those fancy
shindigs of yours?

31:34.426 --> 31:35.792
I don't know,
we haven't done one.

31:35.828 --> 31:37.227
What?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.196
Dad, that's a huge
part of your life.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.764
You need to let her in

31:40.799 --> 31:41.732
and see everything.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.134
I'll tell you what,

31:44.169 --> 31:46.003
why don't we pick an event
out of that pile there,

31:46.038 --> 31:47.371
and you take her
for a night out?

31:47.406 --> 31:48.939
I like that idea.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.508
Take your best shot,
see what you find.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.546
Perfect.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.682
The opera guild.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.183
Opera, perfect.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.153
Fancy, elegant,
that's my girl.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.656
Hmm, I'm sure belle
will have an incredible time.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.892
I'll get Jake to r.S.V.P.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.794
And, uh, thank you.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.229
Thank you,
that was a good idea.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.196
Yeah.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.966
Good, soundly
son-to-father advice.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.301
Hmm.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.937
How is it that you have
managed to stay single

32:19.972 --> 32:21.538
all this time?

32:21.573 --> 32:22.873
Aw, you know what,
dad, that's okay.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.442
You fall in love enough
for the both of us.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.410
Don't you?

32:26.445 --> 32:27.411
Yeah...

32:27.446 --> 32:30.080
And all that whining
and complaining.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.581
He was like a big baby
in hiking boots.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.385
Next time will be better.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.486
And besides,

32:36.522 --> 32:38.388
I never should've taken him
up to wilkes point,

32:38.424 --> 32:40.691
but he admired
the painting so much.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.492
Good thing I'm not looking
for a hiking buddy.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.461
Well...

32:44.496 --> 32:46.229
I'm sure there are
plenty of beginner trails

32:46.265 --> 32:48.031
to hit in Malibu,

32:48.067 --> 32:49.967
when you sell the house.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.135
I was going to tell you,

32:52.171 --> 32:54.304
I just wanted
to ease you into it, honey.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.106
I know the wedding bomb
was a lot.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.275
So you're just
going to sell the house

32:58.310 --> 33:00.911
and move to the land of
sweaty yoga and juice cleanses?

33:00.946 --> 33:03.146
Unless you want
to live here, honey.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.715
Your father left the house

33:04.750 --> 33:05.983
to both of us.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.117
I can't move back here.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.986
I mean, my business
is in San Francisco.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.621
Yes, I understand all that,

33:11.657 --> 33:14.424
but you can't be all business,
all the time, sweetheart.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.892
You need to
enjoy your life.

33:15.928 --> 33:17.160
I enjoy my life.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.762
Do you?
What do you do for fun?

33:18.797 --> 33:21.131
My work is fun.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.132
What about dating?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.234
I don't have time
for that right now.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.536
I just went out on my own,
I started my own firm.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.071
It's about priorities.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.007
What?

33:30.042 --> 33:33.210
I wish you would
make passion a priority.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.778
After all these years,

33:34.813 --> 33:35.912
I finally have,

33:35.948 --> 33:38.648
and I've never been happier.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.117
Hmm?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.209
Psst!

34:08.080 --> 34:09.045
Hey!

34:10.649 --> 34:12.181
Hey!

34:12.217 --> 34:13.150
Hey!

34:13.185 --> 34:14.885
Hey...

34:14.920 --> 34:17.219
Your text said
you had a plan b.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.288
What is it?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.090
An opera guild event,

34:20.125 --> 34:22.025
black tie affair
Friday night.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.159
Oh...

34:23.195 --> 34:26.129
Celebrities, athletes,
red carpet, the whole nine.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.533
Oh, a little glimpse into
Sean's not so simple life?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.068
Yeah, I convinced him
to bring belle,

34:31.103 --> 34:32.668
where she'll be ignored
all night long,

34:32.704 --> 34:33.737
which is what he does.

34:33.772 --> 34:34.871
When you're a celebrity,
you belong to the people.

34:34.907 --> 34:35.906
That's what he says,

34:35.940 --> 34:38.775
that doesn't sound very nice.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.277
I don't like the idea of belle
being ignored all night.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.378
Yeah, but this is his life.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.478
She needs to see
if she can handle it.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.114
Okay, that's good,
that's good,

34:45.150 --> 34:46.183
but we should go, too.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.889
Wait, like a...
Like together?

34:52.925 --> 34:53.889
Yeah.

34:53.926 --> 34:54.858
- Like a date?
- No.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.259
Because I've been asked
on dates before,

34:56.295 --> 34:57.794
and it kind of sounds like
you're asking me out.

34:57.830 --> 34:58.795
I'm not,

34:58.831 --> 35:00.263
I'm asking you on a plan.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.299
Disguised as a date,

35:02.334 --> 35:03.366
so, technically,
it is a date.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.901
What about your talk?

35:04.937 --> 35:06.002
Isn't that on Friday?

35:06.038 --> 35:07.804
I already told them
to replace me on the keynote.

35:07.840 --> 35:08.905
Maybe I can make it
later in the conference.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.006
Oh, good.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.475
Since, you know, you're not
working fast enough

35:11.510 --> 35:12.442
on the task at hand.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.378
What? I'm not
working fast enough?

35:15.414 --> 35:16.713
I'm doing everything
I can here,

35:16.748 --> 35:18.849
all while trying
to appease a client

35:18.884 --> 35:20.584
who is getting
increasingly more frustrated

35:20.619 --> 35:21.852
every minute that I'm gone!

35:21.887 --> 35:23.487
So sensitive, Anna.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.554
I was only kidding.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.522
I knew that.

35:27.493 --> 35:28.725
What is that!

35:28.760 --> 35:30.260
I have no idea.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.496
Okay, so...

35:32.531 --> 35:33.964
Friday night?

35:33.999 --> 35:35.065
- It's a date...
- It's a plan.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.032
It's a date with a plan.

35:36.068 --> 35:37.300
It's a plan with a date.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.469
That's still a date.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.304
I guess I need to
go get a dress.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.272
Yeah.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.240
Good plan.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.774
Good night.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.725
Thank you.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.093
Come again.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.901
Oh, now,
that could work.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.170
I want you to be
the Annabelle of the ball.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.404
Cute. Very cute.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.972
But I'm just going
to be there for belle.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.774
Clay says she'll probably
be ignored the whole time.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.075
Tell me about Clay.

36:19.111 --> 36:20.911
Belle said
he's the whole package.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.846
He sure seems
to think so.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.813
Oh, listen to you,

36:23.849 --> 36:24.981
you're going to
this fancy event

36:25.017 --> 36:26.183
with a handsome surgeon

36:26.218 --> 36:28.752
and you're acting like
you didn't even notice him.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.387
Oh, please, Clay is not...

36:30.422 --> 36:31.821
Charming?

36:31.857 --> 36:32.856
Successful?
Gorgeous?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.791
He's a little
too sure of himself.

36:34.826 --> 36:35.759
And that's
a bad thing?

36:35.794 --> 36:37.360
That kind of charm
is a defense mechanism.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.462
I've seen it
in a thousand depositions.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.364
So he needs a little time
to let people in.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.366
Congratulations,
that makes him human.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.367
You do it, too.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.402
I do not.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.369
I'm just saying

36:46.405 --> 36:48.038
let belle be,

36:48.073 --> 36:49.639
she can handle
whatever happens.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.141
You need to let go

36:51.176 --> 36:52.108
and enjoy your date.

36:52.144 --> 36:53.143
It's not a date.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.881
Hello.
Can I help you?

36:57.916 --> 36:59.816
It's a plan.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.053
Anna, the car is here!

37:04.823 --> 37:06.523
Am I underdressed for you?

37:06.558 --> 37:07.857
No.

37:07.893 --> 37:08.858
Hello, Clay.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.794
You look
beautiful.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.707
Wow.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.477
You look...

37:28.447 --> 37:29.479
You too.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.216
Okay, let's do this.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.562
What do I say if they
ask me any questions?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.130
Well, you just
be yourself.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.565
They're gonna love you.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.566
Hello!

37:49.601 --> 37:50.600
Just remember

37:50.636 --> 37:51.768
when they're taking
all these pictures,

37:51.803 --> 37:53.870
keep your eyes
above the flashbulbs,

37:53.905 --> 37:57.274
otherwise you'll be
blind all night.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.441
Should we just...

38:00.846 --> 38:02.212
We'll meet you inside.

38:02.247 --> 38:03.179
Good luck.

38:03.215 --> 38:04.247
- Good luck!
- Okay, have fun.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.485
This is a zoo.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.719
This is his life.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.289
Now you know
why I live in Boston.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.256
Excuse me?

38:13.292 --> 38:14.257
Yes, hello.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.358
Can we get you
to step back there

38:15.394 --> 38:17.127
so we can
get Sean alone?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.162
Go, go, darling.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.298
See you in a minute.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.365
Hello.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.267
Hello, have you met Corinne,
my lovely co-star.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.102
They just
pushed her aside.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.137
It happens
all the time.

38:27.172 --> 38:30.006
...and she's actually
shared with me

38:30.042 --> 38:31.541
that the word
on the street is

38:31.576 --> 38:33.543
you're lobbying for
the part of Finley Charles

38:33.578 --> 38:34.978
in the latest
superhero franchise.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.513
Care to comment?

38:36.548 --> 38:37.714
I don't know
what street that is.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.282
But I'll wait,
I'll answer the phone.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.450
But that's
a great role,

38:40.485 --> 38:43.353
and, uh, that would be
exciting, wouldn't it?

38:43.388 --> 38:45.288
By the way,
you have almost met

38:45.324 --> 38:46.356
my beautiful fiancee.

38:46.391 --> 38:48.625
This is the lovely
belle Colton.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.427
Fiancee?
Oh, my goodness.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.628
Come here!

38:51.663 --> 38:52.662
Hello.

38:52.698 --> 38:53.630
This is amazing,
we had no idea.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.899
You know, it's been
a long time

38:55.934 --> 38:57.067
since I've been
on a, um...

38:57.102 --> 38:58.134
Plan

38:58.170 --> 38:59.102
with a beautiful woman.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.037
Really? How long?

39:01.073 --> 39:04.240
Well, I was engaged
just over a year ago.

39:04.276 --> 39:05.375
What happened?

39:05.410 --> 39:06.776
If you don't mind
my asking.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.578
No, no, it's fine.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.213
Some women just want
to marry a doctor,

39:10.248 --> 39:11.915
and they don't care
what name

39:11.950 --> 39:13.450
comes in front of
the letters "m.D."

39:13.485 --> 39:15.118
As long as it's
part of the signature.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.953
It doesn't hurt if his dad's
a movie star either.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.688
Oh, that sounds
like a gem.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.757
That's not the word
that I would use.

39:20.792 --> 39:21.725
What about you?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.393
I left my old firm

39:23.428 --> 39:25.562
because they were all about
the bottom line.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.365
They were fleecing clients,
and I just couldn't do that,

39:28.400 --> 39:29.733
so I started my own practice,

39:29.768 --> 39:30.700
and it's a lot,

39:30.736 --> 39:32.102
building a business
from the ground up.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.270
So, that's
my focus right now.

39:34.306 --> 39:35.238
My father always
accuses me

39:35.273 --> 39:36.539
of hiding in my work.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.607
Apparently, to him,

39:37.642 --> 39:39.142
if you're not falling
in love every six months,

39:39.177 --> 39:40.143
you're not
really living.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.745
My aunts say
the same thing to me,

39:41.780 --> 39:42.746
"why aren't you dating?

39:42.781 --> 39:44.013
"Get on one of
those websites.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.348
What happened to
the chef?"

39:45.384 --> 39:47.016
Ooh, what did
happen to the chef?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.885
His one and only
redeeming quality

39:48.920 --> 39:49.886
was his souffle.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.054
Mm, I love a good souffle.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.021
Aw, shucks,

39:52.057 --> 39:52.989
should've married him, huh?

39:53.024 --> 39:53.957
Mm-hmm.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.470
What do you think
he's saying?

40:07.506 --> 40:09.305
I don't know.

40:09.341 --> 40:12.142
Yes, we've learned
so much.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.576
Yes, we have.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.613
Ah, now I get to do

40:16.648 --> 40:18.915
my favorite part.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.053
Shall we, um, shall we
go find out?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.290
Okay.

40:29.060 --> 40:29.993
Thanks.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.060
Yeah.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.664
I'm sorry if
I step on your toes.

40:34.699 --> 40:35.632
I'm a surgeon,

40:35.667 --> 40:36.699
I'm really good
with my hands,

40:36.735 --> 40:38.768
terrible with my feet.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.303
You can't be that bad.

40:40.338 --> 40:41.571
Oh, you'll see.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.241
Oh, look who's here.

40:46.311 --> 40:47.277
Dad.

40:47.312 --> 40:48.645
There's the second
loveliest couple

40:48.680 --> 40:50.613
in the room.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.187
Yup. That's my toe.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.060
I don't doubt
they like each other,

41:04.095 --> 41:06.763
but how can anyone
be so sure of a connection

41:06.798 --> 41:08.031
so fast?

41:08.066 --> 41:09.899
Six days.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.268
That's when my father
said he knew.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.174
Six days?

41:18.210 --> 41:19.142
That's crazy.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.977
How could someone
be so sure,

41:21.012 --> 41:23.313
so soon, right?

41:36.995 --> 41:40.497
I predict we'll be interrupted.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.966
You don't mind?
It's all right?

41:43.935 --> 41:45.468
And you must be?

41:52.010 --> 41:54.644
Where did my aunt go?

41:54.679 --> 41:56.813
Sean. Quick one
of the two of you.

41:56.848 --> 41:57.981
- There.
- Great. Thank you.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.083
Uh, I should...
I should go look for her.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.885
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.758
Hey, there you are.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.159
I can't believe
you got pushed aside

42:10.195 --> 42:11.494
for corrine sellers.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.596
I don't even think she's
that great of an actress.

42:13.632 --> 42:14.664
No, she's not,

42:14.699 --> 42:17.734
but it comes with
the territory, so...

42:17.769 --> 42:21.638
Thank goodness, Sean's ready
to get out of the business.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.506
Are you sure
about that?

42:25.544 --> 42:26.776
Why are you
looking for problems

42:26.811 --> 42:27.810
where none exist?

42:27.846 --> 42:29.045
I'm not looking for problems.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.947
I just...

42:30.982 --> 42:34.951
I feel like he...
He wants a life with you,

42:34.986 --> 42:38.187
but what happens if Hollywood
comes calling again?

42:38.223 --> 42:41.024
Don't you want me to be happy?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.792
Of course I do.

42:42.827 --> 42:45.495
How could you ask me that?

42:45.530 --> 42:47.564
I just...

42:47.599 --> 42:48.965
I just want to make sure

42:49.000 --> 42:50.500
that you know
what you're getting into.

42:50.535 --> 42:53.369
What I'm getting into?

42:54.372 --> 42:55.772
Is that why
we're here tonight?

42:58.243 --> 42:59.242
We thought

42:59.277 --> 43:00.610
that something
was potentially happening

43:00.645 --> 43:03.146
with you and Clay.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.380
But you came here

43:04.416 --> 43:06.416
to pit Sean and me
against each other?

43:06.451 --> 43:08.384
To exaggerate
our differences?

43:08.420 --> 43:09.986
No... I...

43:10.021 --> 43:11.054
Is that it?

43:11.089 --> 43:12.155
Well, it's not as sinister

43:12.190 --> 43:14.657
as you're
making it sound.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.160
I'm not your client, Anna.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.262
I don't need
your counsel,

43:19.297 --> 43:22.398
and I know what I'm doing.

43:22.434 --> 43:23.399
It's just,

43:23.435 --> 43:26.336
this is a bell
that can't be unrung.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.271
Your wedding becomes
national news.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.374
Then so be it.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.343
If this is a mistake...

43:33.378 --> 43:35.445
And I don't think it is...

43:35.480 --> 43:37.180
Then it's my mistake to make.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.083
Not yours.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.217
You need
to stop hiding

43:41.252 --> 43:43.586
in other people's
lives, Anna.

43:43.622 --> 43:46.889
Look in the mirror.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.092
Look in the mirror.

43:49.127 --> 43:53.363
That's whose life
you need to focus on.

43:53.398 --> 43:56.032
Give it a try.

43:56.067 --> 43:58.067
Aunt belle...

44:21.259 --> 44:23.192
Sorry.
I'm very sorry...

44:28.466 --> 44:29.432
There you are.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.367
Hey, have you seen
my aunt?

44:31.403 --> 44:32.735
My dad went
looking for her

44:32.771 --> 44:33.736
about 10 minutes ago.

44:33.772 --> 44:34.804
I didn't see
either of them inside.

44:34.839 --> 44:35.772
Excuse me,

44:35.807 --> 44:36.806
have you seen
Sean castleberry,

44:36.841 --> 44:38.007
by chance?

44:38.043 --> 44:40.076
He and a lady
just left in his limo.

44:40.111 --> 44:41.210
They ditched us.

44:41.246 --> 44:43.579
Could you call us
a taxi, please?

44:43.615 --> 44:45.882
They're angrier
than I thought.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.821
Aunt belle!

44:51.856 --> 44:53.456
Aunt belle, are you here?

44:54.492 --> 44:55.458
Are they here?

44:55.493 --> 44:56.426
They're not
at my dad's place.

44:56.461 --> 44:57.894
Where could they have gone?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.129
Oh, no.

45:00.165 --> 45:02.231
I think I know.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.634
"If you're not with us,
you're against us,

45:04.669 --> 45:05.968
"so we have no choice

45:06.004 --> 45:08.171
but to get married
without you."

45:08.206 --> 45:09.839
They're eloping?

45:13.311 --> 45:14.277
All right, Jake,
keep looking,

45:14.312 --> 45:15.311
and we'll come check out
his computer

45:15.346 --> 45:16.946
as soon as we can. Thanks.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.981
I know, I know,
aunt Suzie,

45:19.017 --> 45:19.949
and we are trying to find them,

45:19.984 --> 45:21.050
and bring them back here,

45:21.086 --> 45:24.053
so they can get married
with all of us together.

45:24.089 --> 45:25.588
Yes, I know,

45:25.623 --> 45:26.823
it is very important

45:26.858 --> 45:28.725
that you meet George Clooney.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.960
Okay, I'll keep
you posted.

45:30.995 --> 45:32.695
Do you, uh,

45:32.731 --> 45:33.896
do you know
her password?

45:33.932 --> 45:34.931
I do.

45:41.606 --> 45:43.372
What's this?

45:45.443 --> 45:47.577
Feels just like prom night.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.580
Jake, the lady says
she has two left feet,

45:50.615 --> 45:53.549
so make sure
you catch both of them on video.

45:54.953 --> 45:57.253
Well, we can't
all be as suave

45:57.288 --> 45:59.088
as Sean castleberry,
can we?

45:59.124 --> 46:01.691
<i>No, well,</i>
<i>that's a full-time job.</i>

46:01.726 --> 46:02.759

46:02.794 --> 46:04.093
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

46:04.129 --> 46:05.628
<i>And...</i>

Forward, forward, forward,

46:36.060 --> 46:39.762
because she made a choice
to raise me.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.230
And here's her chance,

46:41.266 --> 46:43.266

to take this away from her.

46:44.235 --> 46:45.268
No.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.270
No, your intentions were good.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.838
I was trying to control
the situation,

46:48.873 --> 46:51.040
which is what I do.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.975
And now she's
getting married,

46:53.011 --> 46:54.677
and I'm not
going to be there.

46:56.381 --> 46:58.514
This is not the way
it's supposed to be.

47:02.453 --> 47:03.653
We'll find them, okay?

47:03.688 --> 47:04.654

Come on, let's go see

47:05.690 --> 47:07.456
see if we can find any clues
at my dad's house.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.325

Hmm.

47:42.961 --> 47:44.594
Maybe he did a search
for chapels

47:44.629 --> 47:46.195
or a justice of the peace?

47:46.231 --> 47:47.363
We should check
his Internet.

47:47.398 --> 47:48.364
Allow me.

47:48.399 --> 47:49.732
I am very
well acquainted

47:49.767 --> 47:51.300
with how to do
a detailed review

47:51.336 --> 47:53.002
of a browser history.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.403
Divorce lawyer.

47:54.439 --> 47:57.940
These things come in very handy
when things get contentious.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.042
Clay, this is a mess.

48:01.279 --> 48:03.412
Although my aunt
should understand

48:03.448 --> 48:05.615
where I was coming from
in trying to stop her.

48:05.650 --> 48:08.217
She did the exact
same thing to me.

48:08.253 --> 48:10.019
What?

48:10.054 --> 48:11.654
You were married?

48:13.591 --> 48:15.758
I was 19.

48:15.793 --> 48:18.995
I was young and thought
it was true love,

48:19.030 --> 48:21.931
and then, when he left
after six weeks,

48:21.966 --> 48:26.135
well, you can't just pretend
like that never happened.

48:26.170 --> 48:28.170
Everyone tried
to talk me out of it,

48:28.206 --> 48:30.373
but I was so sure of him.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.374
Hmm.

48:31.409 --> 48:32.375
Then you look back on it,

48:32.410 --> 48:33.976
and you can't help but wonder,

48:34.012 --> 48:37.113
what red flags did I miss?

48:37.148 --> 48:42.118
They're always so visible
in hindsight.

48:42.153 --> 48:45.254
Your ex-fiancee?

48:45.290 --> 48:47.056
You feel so stupid

48:47.091 --> 48:48.925
for not seeing
what everyone else did.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.160
Yeah.

48:51.195 --> 48:54.997
Clay, I get that.

48:55.033 --> 48:58.567
But for Sean and belle,
maybe this is the real thing.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.403
Who are we to say?

49:02.573 --> 49:03.773
I went over
your father's accounts,

49:03.808 --> 49:04.807
his credit card was just used

49:04.842 --> 49:07.310
at the millennia hotel...

49:07.345 --> 49:10.112
Viva Las Vegas.

49:10.148 --> 49:11.380
My work here is done.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.616
I'm just going to
go back to bed.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.584
Vegas?

49:19.223 --> 49:20.156
Sorry to wake you.

49:20.191 --> 49:21.424
You have the flights
pulled up yet?

49:21.459 --> 49:22.458
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

49:22.493 --> 49:25.161
I was wide awake.

49:25.196 --> 49:27.830
Are you sure you want to chase
your father

49:27.865 --> 49:29.966
all the way to Nevada?

49:30.001 --> 49:31.133
You know he does what he wants.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.602
I know, but we need to
make sure they do this right.

49:33.638 --> 49:34.570
If they're going there
to get married,

49:34.605 --> 49:35.705
then we need to be
by their sides.

49:35.740 --> 49:37.073
Call Dr. Morgan,

49:37.108 --> 49:39.508
and let him know I won't
make the conference at all.

49:39.544 --> 49:41.477
Okay...

49:41.512 --> 49:43.312
Sorry to call
so early, em,

49:43.348 --> 49:44.780
and I know I said
I'd be home by now,

49:44.816 --> 49:46.649
but I need you
to handle it

49:46.684 --> 49:47.850
if she calls.

49:47.885 --> 49:49.618
Patch her through
to my cell,

49:49.654 --> 49:51.821
no matter what time of day.

49:53.391 --> 49:56.525
<i>Okay, the next flight</i>
<i>leaves in three hours,</i>

49:56.561 --> 49:59.996
but it's only business class
and it's not cheap.

50:00.031 --> 50:02.565
Fine, book us two seats.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.867
Do you want me to charge
her ticket to her credit card?

50:04.902 --> 50:06.402
No, just put them both on mine.

50:06.437 --> 50:09.705
I will book it,
and then I will get back to you

50:09.741 --> 50:11.874
<i>with all the details.</i>

50:11.909 --> 50:15.678
Okay, I will call you
as soon as I land.

50:15.713 --> 50:17.480
You too.

50:17.515 --> 50:18.714
Who needs sleep?

50:18.750 --> 50:20.549
We're going to Vegas.

50:22.020 --> 50:22.985
All right.

50:34.098 --> 50:35.398
Put it all on black!

50:41.873 --> 50:44.306
I'm sorry, but
we don't have two rooms.

50:44.342 --> 50:46.175
I do, however,
have two suites

50:46.210 --> 50:47.410
on the same floor

50:47.445 --> 50:50.813
for a substantially
higher nightly rate.

50:50.848 --> 50:52.081
Of course you do.

50:52.116 --> 50:53.783
Yeah, we'll take
the suites.

50:53.818 --> 50:55.518
How much
substantially higher?

50:55.553 --> 50:57.219
I'm building
a new business now.

50:57.255 --> 50:58.721
It's okay, Anna.

50:58.756 --> 50:59.722
I've got you.

50:59.757 --> 51:00.689
You can pay
me back later.

51:00.725 --> 51:01.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:01.993 --> 51:03.893
Can you tell me

51:03.928 --> 51:05.628
if Sean castleberry
has checked in yet?

51:05.663 --> 51:07.930
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.665
I'm his son.

51:09.700 --> 51:13.469
Look, check my I.D.,
we have the same last name.

51:13.504 --> 51:17.206
I'm still really
not at liberty to say.

51:19.977 --> 51:21.177
I need to find my father.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.311
It's very important,

51:22.346 --> 51:23.379
and his phone
isn't working.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.247
I need to get him...

51:25.283 --> 51:26.315
His, uh, medication.

51:26.350 --> 51:27.349
Medication.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.086
And yet our rules
remain unchanged.

51:31.222 --> 51:32.755
Can you please
help us out here?

51:32.790 --> 51:33.722
We've been up all night.

51:33.758 --> 51:34.690
We're exhausted.

51:34.725 --> 51:35.758
I can tell you

51:35.793 --> 51:38.727
that the bridge over the lobby

51:38.763 --> 51:41.831
is the best place
for people watching.

51:44.802 --> 51:46.435
Thank you.

51:47.605 --> 51:48.904
Can you have someone take
our bags to the rooms, please?

51:48.940 --> 51:50.906
Um, thank you
so much.

51:50.942 --> 51:51.907
Thank you.

51:51.943 --> 51:52.875
And you're talking
this bridge right up here?

51:52.910 --> 51:53.843
Yeah, that bridge
right there.

51:53.878 --> 51:55.377
Okay, thank you.

52:20.938 --> 52:22.872
Hey!

52:22.907 --> 52:23.873
Hey!

52:23.908 --> 52:25.074
I tried to call his room
from the house phone,

52:25.109 --> 52:26.642
but he didn't use
any of his usual aliases.

52:26.677 --> 52:27.743
Yeah, I just did
a search on my phone.

52:27.778 --> 52:28.711
There's over a hundred
wedding chapels

52:28.746 --> 52:29.979
in this town.

52:30.014 --> 52:31.647
How are we supposed
to find them?

52:31.682 --> 52:33.582
I just wish we had, like,
a GPS tracking device.

52:34.719 --> 52:36.318
Not GPS,
but the next best thing.

52:36.354 --> 52:37.286
What?

52:37.321 --> 52:38.487
I can't believe I didn't
think of this sooner.

52:39.457 --> 52:40.523
Twitter.

52:40.558 --> 52:42.491
People love to post
celebrity sightings there.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.528
No, not this one,
not this one...

52:45.563 --> 52:46.495
No...

52:46.531 --> 52:48.831
Here. "Going in
to pick up my watch

52:48.866 --> 52:50.266
"and see Sean castleberry
and his fiancee

52:50.301 --> 52:51.734
buying wedding rings
at galleria jewelers."

52:51.769 --> 52:53.068
"♪Wifenumberfour."

52:53.104 --> 52:54.103
11 minutes ago.

52:54.138 --> 52:55.271
Let's go.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.519
Excuse us.

53:10.555 --> 53:11.720
Excuse me.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

53:11.756 --> 53:12.988
Sorry. Excuse me.

53:13.024 --> 53:14.390
Sorry, comin' through.

53:14.425 --> 53:15.424
So sorry.

53:15.459 --> 53:16.692
No lookie-loos.

53:16.727 --> 53:19.795
Very high-profile client inside.

53:19.830 --> 53:20.963
Oh, we don't
care about that.

53:20.998 --> 53:23.132
We're actually just here
to pick up our wedding rings.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.133
That's right.

53:24.168 --> 53:25.501
I'm the luckiest man
in the world,

53:25.536 --> 53:27.069
this beautiful woman
said yes to me.

53:27.104 --> 53:28.704
You're picking up?

53:28.739 --> 53:29.672
Can I see your receipt?

53:29.707 --> 53:31.540
Oh, shoot!

53:31.576 --> 53:33.876
I, uh, we...
We forgot our receipts,

53:33.911 --> 53:36.145
but, um, I hope
that's not a problem,

53:36.180 --> 53:37.146
because we're
getting married...

53:37.181 --> 53:38.347
Tonight.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.015
And you're waiting until now
to get your wedding rings?

53:40.051 --> 53:41.483
Oh, no, no,
of course not.

53:41.519 --> 53:42.952
No, we came by yesterday
to pick them up,

53:42.987 --> 53:43.919
but the sizes,
they were all wrong.

53:43.955 --> 53:44.920
The sizes were wrong,

53:44.956 --> 53:46.222
and so they told us
to come back today,

53:46.257 --> 53:47.623
by noon,

53:47.658 --> 53:48.824
and they promised us
they would be ready.

53:48.859 --> 53:50.059
Sorry, I can't let you in

53:50.094 --> 53:51.126
without
a receipt.

53:51.162 --> 53:52.528
How long is this
going to take?

53:52.563 --> 53:54.463
I can't say for sure.

53:54.498 --> 53:56.031
Oh, no!

53:56.067 --> 53:57.766
Oh, we just, we don't
have a lot of time.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.468
I've got to go
to the hair salon

53:59.503 --> 54:00.603
and get my hair done,
and my makeup...

54:00.638 --> 54:01.804
And you've got to
get your tux.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.606
And this is
all your fault.

54:03.641 --> 54:04.607
I mean, not you,
personally,

54:04.642 --> 54:05.841
you actually seem like
a very nice man,

54:05.876 --> 54:07.776
but your employer
could be responsible

54:07.812 --> 54:10.079
for ruining
the happiest day of my life!

54:10.114 --> 54:11.614
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
hey, look at me.

54:11.649 --> 54:13.682
We will make
something happen,

54:13.718 --> 54:14.917
even if it's
a twisty-tie, okay?

54:14.952 --> 54:16.285
I will put something
on that finger tonight,

54:16.320 --> 54:17.319
I promise you.

54:17.355 --> 54:18.821
All right, listen...

54:18.856 --> 54:20.923
You're picking up, okay?

54:20.958 --> 54:22.024
When you get inside,

54:22.059 --> 54:23.058
you talk to Alexis,

54:23.094 --> 54:24.159
you tell her
I sent you.

54:24.195 --> 54:25.160
Thank you.

54:25.196 --> 54:28.030
Thank you!
Oh, thank you so much!

54:31.035 --> 54:32.768
Thank you.
You saved me there.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.737
You're good.

54:34.772 --> 54:35.871
Hey, I grew up
in Hollywood.

54:35.906 --> 54:37.106
Hi!

54:37.141 --> 54:38.374
Sorry about
the commotion.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.775
We don't get celebrities
in here too often.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.910
Sean castleberry
and his latest fiancee

54:41.946 --> 54:43.445
were just in here.

54:43.481 --> 54:44.513
Sean castleberry?

54:44.548 --> 54:45.481
Can I see
your receipt?

54:45.516 --> 54:46.448
The movie star!

54:46.484 --> 54:47.583
Oh, my God!

54:47.618 --> 54:49.318
I am the biggest fan.

54:49.353 --> 54:50.319
Yeah, she is. See?

54:50.354 --> 54:51.287
They just went out
that back door there.

54:51.322 --> 54:52.554
Too many photographers.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.356
They wanted
a little privacy.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.458
- Can we see this necklace here?
- Yeah.

55:00.131 --> 55:01.463
Go, go, go!

55:04.402 --> 55:05.768
Okay, faster.

55:07.305 --> 55:09.071
Which way?

55:09.106 --> 55:11.674
You paparazzis should be
ashamed of yourselves!

55:13.744 --> 55:14.677
Great, another dead end.

55:14.712 --> 55:15.978
Not necessarily.

55:16.013 --> 55:17.012
They had this
on the counter.

55:17.048 --> 55:18.914
It's a list of the
preferred wedding chapels.

55:18.949 --> 55:19.915
Well that narrows
it down, at least.

55:19.950 --> 55:21.050
This one's a block
off main street.

55:21.085 --> 55:22.418
Okay, that's this way.

55:37.468 --> 55:40.436
I really hope
this is the one.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.404
Yeah, me too.

55:43.407 --> 55:44.340
Hi.

55:44.375 --> 55:45.341
Hi!

55:45.376 --> 55:47.843
Uh, how much is it
for the gold package?

55:47.878 --> 55:48.944
Oh, that one
is top of the line.

55:48.979 --> 55:49.978
People love it.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.613
My dad doesn't
marry you, Elvis does.

55:51.649 --> 55:54.049
That sounds so romantic.

55:54.085 --> 55:55.884
Tell me, has anyone famous
ever been married here?

55:55.920 --> 55:56.952
Because I really
want to get married

55:56.987 --> 55:58.654
in the same place
as, like, Britney Spears.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.556
Actually, my dad is marrying
some famous dude in there

56:00.591 --> 56:01.557
right now.

56:01.592 --> 56:02.591
He's super old,
so I don't know him,

56:02.626 --> 56:04.827
but my mom recognized
him right away.

56:05.830 --> 56:07.730
Stop the wedding!

56:09.333 --> 56:10.766
- Wow. Wrong wedding.
- So sorry.

56:10.801 --> 56:13.202
- Carry on.
- Really. Congratulations!

56:13.237 --> 56:15.571
You look so beautiful.

56:18.209 --> 56:19.308
I'm pretty sure

56:19.343 --> 56:20.976
that was the host
from "guess which war."

56:21.011 --> 56:22.411
That was not
your father.

56:22.446 --> 56:24.480
Hey, did you
tie the knot?

56:24.515 --> 56:25.814
Did you do it?

56:25.850 --> 56:27.416
Oh, no, we're not...

56:27.451 --> 56:29.084
No, we were
just, um...

56:29.120 --> 56:30.052
Checking the place out.

56:30.087 --> 56:32.121
Oh, well, it's a good place.

56:32.156 --> 56:33.756
Did right by me 60 years ago.

56:33.791 --> 56:35.124
Today as a matter of fact.

56:35.159 --> 56:36.525
Wow!

56:36.560 --> 56:37.793
Well, happy anniversary.

56:37.828 --> 56:39.962
We're redoing our vows
in a few minutes,

56:39.997 --> 56:43.365
and, uh, it's the same place,
same time.

56:43.401 --> 56:44.500
She's even wearing
the same dress.

56:44.535 --> 56:45.868
How did you do it?

56:45.903 --> 56:47.903
I mean, how did you
make it 60 years?

56:47.938 --> 56:49.671
Love.

56:49.707 --> 56:50.672
Uh...

56:50.708 --> 56:52.274
Respect.

56:52.309 --> 56:53.275
And a whole lot of luck.

56:55.312 --> 56:56.979
See, I was
in the military,

56:57.014 --> 56:59.014
and I was about to go
ship overseas,

56:59.049 --> 57:01.884
and, uh, I saw this girl
across this room,

57:01.919 --> 57:03.585
and it was like she was...

57:03.621 --> 57:05.254
Well, she took
my breath away.

57:05.289 --> 57:07.456
It was my Lydia.

57:08.726 --> 57:09.725
So I knew right
there and then

57:09.760 --> 57:10.826
I was going to marry her.

57:10.861 --> 57:13.996
So, took a few days,
locked it on down,

57:14.031 --> 57:14.963
and brought her here,

57:14.999 --> 57:17.065
and we did it
before I went away.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.435
After a few days?

57:19.470 --> 57:21.069
My dear, when it's right,

57:21.105 --> 57:22.938
a few days is all it takes.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.407
She's ready for you.

57:25.443 --> 57:26.608
Ah...

57:26.644 --> 57:28.977
Not allowed to see the bride
before you get married.

57:29.013 --> 57:30.479
Of course not.

57:31.715 --> 57:32.748
Congratulations again.

57:32.783 --> 57:33.782
Thank you.

57:35.686 --> 57:37.519
Come on in.

57:37.555 --> 57:38.520
Come on,

57:38.556 --> 57:40.322
it's getting late,

57:40.357 --> 57:42.057
and there's a lot of chapels
left on this list.

57:59.076 --> 58:01.076
Well, we checked every
chapel on the list,

58:01.111 --> 58:02.711
and no sign of them.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.646
I guess they must
be married by now.

58:04.682 --> 58:06.048
So, that's that.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.516
Yeah, that's that.

58:07.551 --> 58:08.550
And this was probably

58:08.586 --> 58:09.885
the happiest day
of her life,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.487
and I should've been
by her side,

58:11.522 --> 58:12.588
and I wasn't

58:12.623 --> 58:14.256
because I couldn't
put my own stuff aside.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.124
Yeah, I hear you there.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.193
I guess we should get
the next flight out, huh?

58:18.229 --> 58:20.162
Maybe they know
something we don't.

58:20.197 --> 58:22.064
I mean, maybe that man
at the chapel is right.

58:22.099 --> 58:23.665
A few days
is all it takes?

58:23.701 --> 58:25.334
He could've just gone
on his deployment,

58:25.369 --> 58:27.836
but he dove in,
and look at them.

58:27.872 --> 58:29.171
60 years.

58:29.206 --> 58:30.172
He also said

58:30.207 --> 58:31.907
there's a certain
amount of luck involved.

58:31.942 --> 58:33.909
Maybe we just haven't
been that lucky yet.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.010
Did you just say "luck"?

58:35.045 --> 58:36.011
Yeah, I said "luck."

58:39.850 --> 58:41.917
Maybe ours is changing.

58:43.220 --> 58:44.386
Eight!
Eight! Eight! Eight!

58:44.421 --> 58:46.688
Ah, somebody's
on a hot streak up there.

58:46.724 --> 58:47.656
Yeah, no kidding.

58:47.691 --> 58:50.626
Go! Go! Go!

58:51.595 --> 58:54.596
Yes!

58:56.667 --> 58:59.468
All right, guys,
give me another eight.

58:59.503 --> 59:01.270
Mama needs
a new pair of glasses.

59:01.305 --> 59:02.604
Glasses?

59:02.640 --> 59:04.072
I have plenty of shoes.
I need sunglasses.

59:04.108 --> 59:05.107
Mwah!

59:06.143 --> 59:07.809
Whoo!

59:07.845 --> 59:08.810
Yeah!

59:08.846 --> 59:10.178
You're my lucky charm!

59:10.214 --> 59:12.180
Maybe you're mine.

59:13.717 --> 59:14.650
It was a good night.

59:14.685 --> 59:15.951
Despite not finding them,

59:15.986 --> 59:17.586
it was nice
to just roll the dice

59:17.621 --> 59:18.754
and take our chances.

59:18.789 --> 59:19.821
Pun intended.

59:19.857 --> 59:20.889
I like the Anna who
throws caution to the wind.

59:20.925 --> 59:21.857
And dives in.

59:21.892 --> 59:22.925
She's a blast.

59:22.960 --> 59:23.926
I like lucky Clay.

59:23.961 --> 59:26.061
He's fun, and free,

59:26.096 --> 59:27.763
and never rolls a seven,
not once.

59:27.798 --> 59:28.997
That was a fluke,
had to be.

59:44.682 --> 59:47.583
Letting go
is good, Anna.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.285
Letting go is good.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.498
Sorry.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.201
Excuse me.

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:11.974
Goodnight, Anna.

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:13.909
Goodnight, Clay.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.828
Look, Gloria, I know,
but we have to play hardball.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.163
No, we're not trying
to take him for all he's got.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:38.166
We're trying get you
what you deserve.

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:39.768
Okay, I'll send
this email right away,

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.103
and I'll talk to you soon.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.371
Okay, Renee,

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.539
we'll print our boarding passes
at the airport.

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.642
<i> You want me to put it</i>
<i>on your card again?</i>

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:48.243
Don't worry, Renee,
she'll pay me back.

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.911
Clay, I didn't say anything.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.279
You did.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.648
<i>I just need you to tell me</i>
<i>what you want me to do.</i>

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:54.650
Just use my card
for both, okay?

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.752
She doesn't have
her checkbook with her.

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.020
Okay, why are you being
so defensive?

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.121
I wasn't implying anything.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.056
I'm not,
I'm just...

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.958
E-mail me
the itinerary, okay?

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.292
Great.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.260
Hi.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:06.528
Hi.

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:07.863
I ordered pancakes and eggs

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.264
since we need to leave
for the airport in 20 minutes.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:11.266
That sounds great.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.668
Thanks.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:15.871
So...

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.074
Oh, opposing counsel.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.075
I need to take this.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.443
But I will meet you
at check out?

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:22.444
Yeah, sure.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:23.445
Desmond, hey, tell me

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.880
you've talked some sense
into your client.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:27.282
No, he needs to man up
and support her financially.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.351
It's his responsibility.

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:32.220
Are you serious?

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:36.124
So what if she chose not to work
when his practice took off?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.592
This doesn't make any sense.

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:39.394
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.364
I'll just call it up here
and get you checked out...

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.398
Oh, here you are,
Mr. castleberry.

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:44.499
Hey.

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.435
And I do hope the suites
were to your satisfaction.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.370
Doesn't look like
there's any incidentals,

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:49.438
- nothing from the spa.
- No.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:50.706
I hope you
enjoyed your stay.

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.441
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:53.675
I see you found
your father.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.243
Glad you were able to
get him his medication.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.712
Excuse me?

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:58.847
Aunt belle!

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.182
Anna?

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.783
Oh, my goodness!

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:02.884
We have been calling

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.052
and looking for you everywhere!

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.087
Look who's here.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:06.121
Dad.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:09.524
Where's your
wedding ring?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.860
I believe it's in a box
in Sean's suitcase.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:14.362
Belle didn't want
to go through with it.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.098
She wanted you, and Suzie,

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.265
and her family to be
at her side.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.266
I wanted my son
with me.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:20.202
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.536
That's why
we're here.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:22.671
Really?

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.673
'Cause I haven't listened
to any of your messages.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.008
I didn't need
any more bad news

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:28.877
from
Dougie downer again.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.245
Okay, that's fair.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.948
Look, if you guys are 100%
certain about this marriage,

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:33.982
then I'm behind it.

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:36.184
I feel the same way.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.086
I could not live with myself

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:39.988
if I missed
the happiest day of your life.

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.223
Aw...

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.091
Well, that's what
we've been waiting to hear

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:44.993
all along.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.329
Then let's go home
and do this right.

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:48.396
All right.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.464
Okay!

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.732
We have a wedding to plan.

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:52.667
Come on.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.509
We need to be quick,

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:02.177
we have the food
tasting in an hour.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:04.212
Do you want me and Suzie
in the same dress,

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.380
since we're both
your bridesmaids?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:06.381
Oh, please,

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:07.916
I would never put you
in any matchy-matchy

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.451
pouf taffeta dress.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:10.552
Ooh, what about this?

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.288
Why do you even
have that?

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.323
It was a special request
for a regular client.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.391
She wanted a mini.

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:17.926
And don't judge.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.161
Her wedding
was canceled.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.262
Somebody will buy it.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.696
It's just not
going to be us, right?

01:03:21.732 --> 01:03:22.764
No.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.232
You seem different.

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:25.200
More fun, Anna.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.601
What? No.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.069
I-I just, you know,
maybe I'm happy

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:29.104
because aunt belle is happy.

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.373
Oh, please,
no one's buying that.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:33.508
What is going on
with you and Dr. Clay?

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:34.476
Well, let's see,

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:37.546
for starters,
he lives in Boston,

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:38.880
and I live
in San Francisco.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.348
Logistics can always
be worked out.

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:41.817
You like him.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.618
He did show me
a different side

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.654
once he opened up.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:47.589
Hmm.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.857
I seem to recall

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:50.559
saying the exact same
thing about Sean.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:51.893
And what did you say?

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:54.362
Something about
taking things slow?

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:55.330
And now?

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.766
I stand a little
bit corrected?

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:59.100
Look at that.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:02.070
You've only known Clay
a few days, and...

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:03.138
Maybe that's
all it takes.

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.541
Yeah...

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:07.909
She likes him.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.010
Uh-huh.
She likes him.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.046
Yeah, she does.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:15.617
You ready for tomorrow?

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.853
Mentally, yes.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:19.421
As for what I'm wearing,

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.555
that's still
up in the air.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:21.523
Not anymore.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:22.524
I have your shirt.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.459
Also some food
for you to grill tonight.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:26.428
You're
a lifesaver, Jake.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:28.330
He'd die without you.
You know that, right?

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:31.299
I know that.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.237
I am happy for you,
you know.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.338
Despite evidence
to the contrary.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.839
Yeah, I believe you.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.975
I know that.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.109
Clay, I know

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:43.745
I've made some mistakes.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.548
I wasn't always the most
attentive father, was I?

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.452
You did
the best you could, dad.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.921
I know it was hard for you
after mom died.

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.257
I mean, let's face it,

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.758
she took care of both of us,
didn't she?

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:58.260
Yeah.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.494
She used to say
she had two children,

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:00.462
you and me.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:05.100
We all have to grow up
sooner or later.

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:06.635
Right.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.703
Some of us just
a little later than others.

01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:10.906
That would be me.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.150
I'm putting Mr. Lewis
at the kids' table.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:24.653
I think it's happening.
That's what I'm doing.

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.154
Like that...

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.122
What do we do...

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.189
Does that work?

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:30.558
Who replies the day
before a wedding?

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:31.626
I have no idea

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:32.827
where I'm going to
put all these people,

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:34.329
because the chart
is done.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.497
Yeah, but we still
have to find room

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:36.598
for Sean's cousins.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.767
Separate them.
You'll thank me later.

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:40.568
Yeah, Sean told me about them.

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:42.871
Are you doing okay?

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.773
I know you had to
cancel your conference.

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:46.374
Well, my talk
has come and gone,

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.542
but I'm still going to Miami
for four days.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.178
Alone, or...

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.179
With a friend?

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:53.481
Alone.

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:55.383
Well, that doesn't
seem like very much fun.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.452
Look, I just don't want
to get blindsided again.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.788
You know, like with Vivian?

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:01.323
I never saw that coming.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.826
I know that was
hard on you, Clay,

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:07.562
but it's important that you try
not to look for a Vivian

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:08.830
in someone named Anna.

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.967
I think they're two
very different people.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.338
Oh, no!

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:17.405
No, no, no!

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.441
I don't need
an assistant,

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:20.542
I need a fireman.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.143
But I'm blaming
the grill.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.778
It was way too hot.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:24.746
You've got to
fix that.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.314
Vesuvius
wasn't that hot.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.315
It was the grill's fault.

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.552
How about I run out

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:32.487
and get us some food

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:35.056
so we have something
to eat tonight.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.157
I'll come with you.

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:38.226
- Okay.
- Make mine rare.

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:39.194
Hey, do you want me
to drive?

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:41.363
No, that's okay.
I got it.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.667
Oh, it's a beautiful night.

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.303
Yeah...

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.637
Yeah, I wanted to come

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.840
because we haven't really
had the chance to talk about...

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:53.475
The elevator.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.676
Mm-hmm.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.412
I was going to
bring that up

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:58.580
at the airport,

01:06:58.615 --> 01:06:59.848
but your dad was there,

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:02.550
and my aunt, so...

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.652
That wasn't me...

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:05.620
Usually.

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.789
Me either,

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:09.157
but it was good for me.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.560
I decided,

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:14.529
even though
I missed the conference,

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:18.033
I'm still going to go to Miami
after the wedding.

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:21.469
I had Renee clear my schedule
for a few days.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.304
I had fun in Vegas.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.873
I realized there's
a whole big world

01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.341
outside the O.R.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.144
Yeah, there's a big world
outside the courtroom, too.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:34.749
Well...

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.151
Maybe you should come with me.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.256
Just think about it, okay?

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.725
I know that you have
a big client right now,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.260
but they have
wifi there.

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:47.662
And it's only
for a few days.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:53.101
Plus, I kinda sorta
maybe really like

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:54.436
"fun and free"
Clay and Anna.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.907
I'd like to see them
in the real world.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:02.844
See how they'd do under less
heightened circumstances.

01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:06.881
You know, no pressure.

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.316
Just think about it.

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:13.788
Okay.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.404
So, what do you want to eat?

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.740
Ooh, I don't know,
um, pasta, chicken, cupcakes?

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.209
Cupcakes for dinner?

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.944
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:39.881
Well, I don't have
much of a sweet tooth.

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.249
Looks like
we're not starting out so well

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.051
in the real world, are we?

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.921
He's standing firm?

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.022
She supported him

01:08:48.058 --> 01:08:49.957
when he didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:51.792
I'm so sorry!

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:54.562
Our niece is a very
high-powered attorney.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:57.899
That's not an offer,
Desmond, that's an insult.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.634
Of course.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:04.005
He's handsome,
charming, a doctor.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:04.973
Did I mention rich?

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:06.307
Because he is.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:07.509
He's wealthy.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:08.475
Very wealthy.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.310
The whole package.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.312
Any smart woman

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:12.613
would grab on
to a guy like that

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.216
and hold on
for dear life, right?

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.451
He should have
no problem

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.987
paying for everything.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:25.093
Okay, garter, veil,

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:27.895
extra Bobby pins.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.731
Wedding shoes,
that's what we're forgetting.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.666
On the couch.

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:32.667
Anna, why don't you
take a load off

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:33.835
and have some champagne?

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:34.836
We don't have to leave

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.337
for at least
another 90 minutes.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.772
And you still need
to get your hair done.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:38.773
That's true,

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.875
but you can't wear
slippers to your wedding.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:42.609
She could get married
in anything

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.812
and still be a vision.

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:46.046
True.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:48.883
You are the most beautiful
bride I've ever seen.

01:09:48.919 --> 01:09:50.818
All right,
I need in on this.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.886
Sorry.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.327
I just wish dad
were here to see this.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:02.430
Yeah, we all do.

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.968
But you're getting
to live your dream.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:09.204
And it's about time.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.039
You can, too,
you know.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:14.676
All you have
to do is let go

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.178
and give yourself
permission.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:20.782
True.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.618
Okay, let's finish.

01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:54.215
Clay, wait till
you hear this!

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.750
What's with
the suitcase?

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.619
Oh, I'm leaving
right after the wedding.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:58.987
It was the only flight
I could get for my trip.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.088
Ah-hah.

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:02.824
Well, I just got off the phone
with my agent.

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:05.126
I've been offered the role
of fearless leader

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:07.562
in "land of the robonauts."

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.731
Wait, fearless leader,
Finley Charles?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.299
Yeah, it's going to be
the biggest superhero movie

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:12.300
of the decade.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:13.301
A whole franchise.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:14.569
I used to read you
those comics?

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:15.870
Actually,
you bought them for me.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:16.904
I used to read them to myself,

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.239
but yeah,
I remember.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.641
Well, whatever.

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:22.010
Your dad's gonna have
a hot year.

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:24.112
What about belle?

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.580
And the ranch and retiring?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.115
Yes, well, there's a lot
to work out,

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.216
things to talk about.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.985
This is what you do.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.787
Why can't people
just tell the truth?

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:34.188
Huh? Cards on the table.

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:35.456
What you see is what you get.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.759
Why can't people just be
who they say they are?

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.093
What's the matter with you?

01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.561
Dad, I'm not
going to sit here

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:41.896
and watch you
do that to belle.

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:43.064
Do what?

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.565
You haven't
let me finish.

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:46.601
Hey, I can tell you
the whole...

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.835
I have experience at this.

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.537
I can make it work.

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:50.605
Oh, you have plenty
of experience

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.407
at this, dad.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:02.283
What's wrong, honey?

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:03.584
I don't know.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.553
Everything was fine
with Clay last night,

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.089
and then today, it's just been
complete radio silence.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.993
Anna?

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.929
I was just getting
my camera from the car

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:16.698
and I bumped into Jake.

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:17.865
Clay's not coming
to the wedding.

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.367
Wait, what?

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:20.635
He's gone
to the airport.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.636
The airport?

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.037
Do you have any idea why?

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:24.806
I think I might.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.041
He and I were
going to go to Miami

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:29.010
and he must have just
gotten spooked.

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:30.578
Everything was just
moving so fast.

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:31.579
You don't know that.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:32.580
Maybe he had
an emergency.

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:33.581
He would call or text.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:34.916
There's no other
explanation.

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.417
I don't think
that's it.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.618
We've all seen the way
he looks at you.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.686
I'm going to go
talk to Sean.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:42.256
Maybe he knows
something about Clay.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:00.842
I didn't expect
to get this part.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.043
It was a silly fantasy.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:03.678
A lot of big actors
wanted it, too.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.879
I know.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:07.081
I just wish
I had belle's blessing.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:08.549
You need to talk to her, Sean.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.585
You need to find out
what she wants.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.652
I'll tell you
what she wants,

01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:13.488
she wants for us
to be living on a ranch,

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:16.457
and the minute she finds out
that I'm taking this movie...

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.458
You and your son

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:18.693
are never going to
be satisfied, are you?

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.761
Either of you?

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:21.696
Hold on, wait a second.
You don't understand...

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.197
No, I don't understand.

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:26.200
Why does nobody
let me finish?

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:27.402
Clay is mad at me.

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.337
He thinks I'm going to
hurt belle.

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:30.371
Wait, Clay is mad at you?

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:31.973
I thought he was upset with me.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.007
I'm telling you,

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:34.142
if she doesn't want me
to do this film,

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.144
I'm out, I'll drop it.

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:38.346
She is much more
important to me.

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:42.049
Sean, that's beautiful,
but it's your wedding day.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.885
I think you should go
talk to her.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.753
She's an incredible woman.
She might surprise you.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.889
I'll give it a try.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:49.424
Okay.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:07.241
He's a good guy, right?

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.445
Complicated...

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.946
But very good.

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.516
Exceptional, even.

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:20.188
Anna...

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:21.722
Please tell me

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:22.723
why Sean is
seeing the bride

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:23.891
before the wedding?

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:25.259
Thank goodness she's not even
in her wedding gown yet.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:26.928
Everything is fine,
aunt Suzie...

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:30.465
I'm marrying
Finley Charles!

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.133
My favorite
fearless leader

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.368
in the entire
comic book universe!

01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:35.369
What?

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.639
Sean got the part.

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.208
When we're shooting,

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:41.442
we're staying in hotels

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:43.211
with round-the-clock
room service,

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.278
and I don't have to cook.

01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:45.346
And when we're not,

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:47.081
we're in Malibu
at our ranch..

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.416
Fine compromise.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:50.418
Oh, it's
the perfect one.

01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:52.220
And it's a great
occasion, isn't it?

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:54.121
The only thing
missing is my son.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.389
He's not answering
his phone.

01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:57.792
I really
need him here.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.060
I should get
to the airport...

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:00.027
No!

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:01.395
Sean, you need to get
to the ceremony.

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:02.663
You have guests to greet.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:03.798
I'll go get him.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.199
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:06.567
Take my car.
The keys are in it.

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:07.602
- Perfect.
- Go, go, go.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:08.603
And hurry!

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.804
You'd better not
miss my wedding!

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:13.107
I will be there
with time to spare!

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:15.476
All right, you,
let's get you ready, please.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:16.811
Thank you.

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:34.962
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.330
<i>for flight 412 to Miami,</i>

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:38.165
<i>we are still waiting</i>
<i>for our aircraft to arrive,</i>

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.368
<i>and it's looking like we'll have</i>
<i>a slight delay.</i>

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:42.169
<i>We apologize</i>
<i>for any inconvenience.</i>

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:46.307
Clay?

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:47.575
Clay!

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:48.609
Hey!

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.111
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.279
What are you doing here?

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:53.481
I had to buy a ticket
to get past the security gate,

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:54.515
but I don't know why
you're not taking my calls

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.984
or answering
any of my texts,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.686
but I'm here for your dad.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.321
He really wants you there.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:01.889
Wait a second, they're going
through with the wedding?

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:02.957
They are.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:04.492
They worked it out,

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:06.627
and you would know that
if you hadn't run away.

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:09.697
Yeah, well,
maybe someone pushed me.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.766
What are you talking about?

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:14.969
I heard you talking
on the phone this morning,

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:16.203
about marrying a rich doctor.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.872
Every woman's dream?

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.907
Just grabbing on
and never letting go?

01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:22.510
You're just like
the rest of them.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:23.511
Wow.

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:29.884
That's how little
you think of me?

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:34.889
I was talking about
my client's ex.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.124
But I won't even bother
explaining that to you

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.893
because you see the world
through damaged eyes,

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:42.463
and the truth isn't going to
make a difference.

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:44.832
Come to your father's
wedding, Clay,

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:45.833
or don't.

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:47.768
I don't really care
what you do.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:57.511
She bought a ticket

01:16:57.547 --> 01:16:59.146
to come in here
and find you?

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:01.549
Day of flight...

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:03.985
That couldn't have been cheap.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.087
Go get her!

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.088
You're right.

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:11.592
Anna, wait up!
Anna!

01:17:15.311 --> 01:17:16.944
Just talk to me!

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.945
Anna!

01:17:20.783 --> 01:17:21.749
What is the matter with you?

01:17:21.784 --> 01:17:23.317
Six days.

01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:25.820
What?

01:17:25.855 --> 01:17:27.088
That's when I knew, too.

01:17:28.558 --> 01:17:29.824
On the dance floor,
after six days,

01:17:29.859 --> 01:17:31.959
just like my dad with belle.

01:17:31.995 --> 01:17:34.562
I tried to ignore it,

01:17:34.597 --> 01:17:37.465
but nothing has ever felt
more right to me than you.

01:17:39.235 --> 01:17:42.536
Which is
terrifying for me.

01:17:42.572 --> 01:17:44.238
Trust is not my strong suit.

01:17:44.273 --> 01:17:46.574
I'm a work in progress,
what can I say?

01:17:46.609 --> 01:17:48.476
Why didn't you just ask me

01:17:48.511 --> 01:17:50.411
if you thought you overheard
something questionable?

01:17:50.446 --> 01:17:53.047
Well, you know what they say
about people who assume?

01:17:53.082 --> 01:17:54.148
They're idiots?

01:17:55.151 --> 01:17:58.352
Yeah, they're
complete and total idiots.

01:17:58.388 --> 01:18:00.388
I'm so sorry
that I ever doubted you.

01:18:00.423 --> 01:18:02.757
You should be.

01:18:02.792 --> 01:18:04.025
So, what do you say?

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.093
You still wanna go
to Miami with me?

01:18:06.129 --> 01:18:08.496
Well, I still
have a ticket.

01:18:09.499 --> 01:18:10.498
But if you bail
on me again...

01:18:10.533 --> 01:18:11.499
Anna, just...

01:18:11.534 --> 01:18:13.000
Stop talking.

01:18:29.352 --> 01:18:31.452
Hey, this is the exact spot

01:18:31.487 --> 01:18:32.553
where you spilled
your coffee on me.

01:18:32.588 --> 01:18:34.955
You spilled
my coffee on you.

01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:36.924
I don't think so.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.894
It never did come
out of that shirt.

01:18:39.929 --> 01:18:42.630
Yeah, I gotta tell ya,

01:18:42.665 --> 01:18:43.931
it's not that big of a loss.

01:18:52.508 --> 01:18:53.874
Okay, no more kissing,

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:54.942
we have to go.

01:18:54.977 --> 01:18:55.910
After all of this,

01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:57.611
we are not missing
that wedding.

01:18:57.647 --> 01:18:59.513
Right.

01:18:59.549 --> 01:19:00.748
Let's go.

01:19:00.783 --> 01:19:02.183
All right.

01:19:04.387 --> 01:19:05.753
I parked over here.

01:19:05.788 --> 01:19:06.854
Okay.

01:19:08.491 --> 01:19:10.391
Yes, okay.
I'll do it, thanks.

01:19:10.426 --> 01:19:13.294
Where are they?

01:19:16.332 --> 01:19:17.298
Any sign of them?

01:19:17.333 --> 01:19:18.299
No,

01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:19.500
and no one is answering
their cell phones.

01:19:19.535 --> 01:19:20.901
Belle, I'm sorry,

01:19:20.937 --> 01:19:22.803
but the minister says
we have to start now.

01:19:22.839 --> 01:19:24.305
He has another wedding
to do after this.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.340
Five more minutes?

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:27.308
I don't think we can wait.

01:19:27.343 --> 01:19:28.309
Ask him.

01:19:28.344 --> 01:19:29.677
I will. Okay.

01:19:29.712 --> 01:19:31.178
Excuse me, could we
just have five...

01:19:31.214 --> 01:19:33.180
No, I'm sorry.

01:19:35.551 --> 01:19:36.517
We can't wait.

01:19:36.552 --> 01:19:37.818
So we do this now,

01:19:37.854 --> 01:19:39.053
or you lose
your minister.

01:19:40.056 --> 01:19:40.988
Now it is.

01:19:41.023 --> 01:19:42.923
Good answer.

01:19:42.959 --> 01:19:45.126
It's a beautiful day.

01:19:45.161 --> 01:19:46.427
I've got you.

01:19:46.462 --> 01:19:48.129
And you look
beautiful.

01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:49.630
And you're
getting married!

01:19:52.001 --> 01:19:53.200
To the man I love.

01:19:55.471 --> 01:19:57.371
You think
we can make it?

01:19:57.406 --> 01:20:00.074
I certainly hope so.
You drove like a crazy woman.

01:20:00.109 --> 01:20:01.475
Let's do this.

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:03.410
All right.

01:20:06.983 --> 01:20:08.916
The wedding was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago.

01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:10.985
I know, I know.
We got this.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.787
All rise.

01:20:16.726 --> 01:20:19.560
Oh, they wouldn't
start without us.

01:20:22.431 --> 01:20:23.697
You were saying?

01:20:23.733 --> 01:20:25.166
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:27.268
We're here!

01:20:27.303 --> 01:20:28.769
Wait!

01:20:30.373 --> 01:20:32.039
We're here!

01:20:32.074 --> 01:20:33.007
Stop the wedding!

01:20:33.042 --> 01:20:34.108
Stop the wedding!

01:20:35.111 --> 01:20:36.243
You made it!

01:20:39.048 --> 01:20:40.447
You're here!

01:20:40.483 --> 01:20:42.283
Oh, I would not miss it
for the world.

01:20:42.318 --> 01:20:43.350
Good to see you, George.

01:20:43.386 --> 01:20:45.820
Sorry we're late.

01:20:45.855 --> 01:20:46.854
Hey.

01:20:46.889 --> 01:20:48.222
Hey, dad.

01:20:48.257 --> 01:20:49.623
Hey, better late
than never, right?

01:20:49.659 --> 01:20:50.858
Yeah.

01:20:50.893 --> 01:20:52.660
Sorry about the outfit.

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:53.761
That's all right.
You made it.

01:20:53.796 --> 01:20:55.696
Are you ready?

01:20:55.731 --> 01:20:57.364
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.532
