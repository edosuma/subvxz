WEBVTT

00:20.240 --> 00:23.722
Why don't you come on out,
join us in the road?

00:23.880 --> 00:25.723
That's great.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.082
It's going well
right out of the gate.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.607
Now, step two,
hand over your weapons.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.202
- Why should we?
- Well, they're not yours.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.442
Whose are they?

00:38.360 --> 00:43.082
Your property
now belongs to Negan.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.084
And if you can get your hands
on a tanker,

00:53.280 --> 00:55.886
you're people our person
wants to know.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.848
So let's get those sidearms,
shall we?

01:01.640 --> 01:03.642
Right now.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.402
Thank you.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.562
Thank you.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.482
If you have to eat shit,

01:27.640 --> 01:29.802
best not to nibble.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.691
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.569
It goes quicker.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.881
( Mouths )
Thank you.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.169
Sasha:
Who are you people?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.846
I get the curiosity,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.207
but we have questions ourselves.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.285
And we'll be
the ones asking them

02:01.440 --> 02:05.365
while we drive you back
to wherever it is you call home.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.370
Take a gander
at where you hang your hats.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.843
First, though, your shit.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.365
What have you got for us?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.045
Yeah, you just took it.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.004
Come on.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.487
I mean, can we not, okay?

02:23.640 --> 02:25.483
There's more.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.211
There is always more.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.208
( Sighs )

02:32.360 --> 02:34.931
T...

02:35.080 --> 02:37.686
take my man to the back
of the truck,

02:37.880 --> 02:39.723
start inside the back bumper,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.201
work your way to the front.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.441
Go.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.729
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.245
Who's Negan?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.761
â™ª Ding, dong â™ª

02:54.920 --> 02:57.048
â™ª Hell's bells. â™ª

02:59.800 --> 03:02.644
You see, usually
we introduce ourselves

03:02.800 --> 03:05.041
by just popping one of you
right off the bat.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.083
But you seem
like reasonable people.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.040
I mean, you're sportin' dress blues,
for Christ's sake.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.441
And, like I said, we're gonna drive you
back to where you were.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.443
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

03:15.600 --> 03:18.331
carpooling with someone whose friend
or friends you've just killed?

03:18.480 --> 03:20.482
00f.

03:20.640 --> 03:24.725
But I told you
not to ask any questions.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.928
And then what does
this ginger do?

03:28.880 --> 03:30.769
So that's that.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.048
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.929
- ( Hammer clicks )
- Wait.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.684
Wait.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.649
You don't have to do this.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.604
Shut up.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.809
I am talking to the man.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.651
No, you're not.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.044
( Hammer clicks )

04:00.880 --> 04:04.009
( sighs )

04:04.160 --> 04:06.447
I'm not gonna kill you.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.807
( Sighs )

04:11.960 --> 04:14.964
Wait, wait.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.123
You know what?
Yes, I am.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.486
( Sasha grunts )

04:39.640 --> 04:41.165
( groans )

04:41.320 --> 04:42.845
( groans, coughs )

04:48.760 --> 04:50.410
Son of a bitch
was tougher than he looked.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.004
- Sasha: Did he cut you?
- A little.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.891
What a bunch of assholes.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.361
Let's get you fixed up at home.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.363
Yes, ma'am.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.603
( Spits )

05:12.920 --> 05:15.048
Nibble on that.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.690
( Theme music playing )

07:53.240 --> 07:57.131
All right, new plan.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.362
Flares from a few guns
aren't enough.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.091
Too many walkers, too spread out.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.050
We're not going to the armory.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.885
We need our vehicles
back at the quarry.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.441
All of us drive.
We'll need to round 'em up.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.046
We leave, we come back.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.969
Okay.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.368
But Judith...

08:21.560 --> 08:23.085
to the quarry and back, I...

08:29.640 --> 08:31.881
I'll take her.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.405
Keep her safe in my church

08:33.559 --> 08:35.323
until you all lead the walkers away.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.847
Can you do this?

08:42.159 --> 08:44.082
I'm supposed to.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.571
I have to.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.402
I will.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.570
All right.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.000
(whimpering )

08:55.160 --> 08:56.730
Shh, shh, shh.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.482
Shh, shh, shh...

09:05.920 --> 09:07.524
- Take Sam.
- No.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.160
- Yes, Sam, it'll be safer.
- I'm not leaving you.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.443
- Sam--
- Mom, I'm not.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.125
I can keep going.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.926
- Sam--
- I can keep going.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.691
Please.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.282
Please.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.448
Let's just go.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.889
Okay.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.721
I'm going to keep her safe.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.531
Thank you.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.043
Shh, shh, shh...

10:10.480 --> 10:11.481
<i>He'! '</i>

10:11.640 --> 10:13.529
He's gonna make it.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.170
Okay?

10:16.760 --> 10:19.604
I know it.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.810
Sam.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.964
(growling )

10:56.200 --> 10:57.770
We have to try.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.251
We cannot go out there.
There are too many of them.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.971
- Rosita, he's gonna kill her.
- We won't get to her.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.726
- She needs us.
- We'll die.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.451
That is what will happen.
We have one gun,

11:07.640 --> 11:10.644
and the streets are filled
with those things.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.609
That man needs her.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.206
Okay? She's a doctor.
He is sick.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.482
And I think we've seen
that he knows how to survive.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.564
But we need to make sure
that Carol and Morgan are okay

11:20.720 --> 11:23.690
and then we make a plan.
We cannot just go.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.203
- Okay.
- Carol: Oh, God.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.405
( Groans )

11:33.560 --> 11:36.086
Rosita, gonna need your gun.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.844
Gonna do a sweep
of the brownstone.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.401
I want to see what other surprises
are in here.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.609
Hey, he's waking up.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.689
Easy.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.763
( Groans )

11:52.000 --> 11:53.923
Where is he?

11:56.240 --> 11:58.004
Where's Denise?

11:58.160 --> 12:01.004
He took her, didn't he?

12:07.920 --> 12:09.922
Let's get you UP-

12:38.280 --> 12:40.726
Maybe when they searched this place,
they missed something.

12:40.880 --> 12:45.283
Depends if it was Aiden
or Heath's group who went through it.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.404
Easy.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.804
(growling )

12:54.000 --> 12:56.810
Look in the Bibles, too.
Could've hollowed out the pages.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.809
Are you serious?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.684
We have two bullets.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.803
People holed up in here--

13:04.920 --> 13:08.003
people hide guns, ammo.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.004
Maybe something to start a fire.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.527
It's getting dark out soon.
Maybe we can distract them.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.685
We need sheets, ropes, towels--

13:17.840 --> 13:20.241
anything Maggie can use
to climb down the other side.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.608
How things turn.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.522
Enid.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.682
When I wanted to run...

13:45.040 --> 13:48.806
you said,
"That's how you lose people...

13:52.720 --> 13:54.961
even after they're gone."

13:58.880 --> 14:01.281
What the hell does that mean?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.407
People you love...

14:08.040 --> 14:09.485
they made you who you are.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.566
Glenn:
They're still part of you.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.087
If you stop being you,

14:16.240 --> 14:19.403
that last bit of them that's still
around inside, who you are...

14:21.080 --> 14:23.082
it's gone.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.323
Who are those people to you?

14:27.480 --> 14:29.767
My parents.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.084
A man named Dale.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.811
Maggie's father, Hershel.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.440
A woman named Andrea.
A man named Tyreese.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.728
Who are they to you?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.122
My parents.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.171
Then they're still here...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.766
'cause you're still here.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.604
When there's an opening,
we'll make a break for that tower.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.881
Hmm?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.610
No, I'll just slow you down.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.802
Denise.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.646
Denise, you're here...

15:16.800 --> 15:18.962
with me.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.884
I need you.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.202
Maybe I want you to stay

15:25.400 --> 15:26.890
'cause I'm enjoying
your company so much.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.485
( Chuckles )

15:31.360 --> 15:33.488
I want you to stay put.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.721
What?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.166
I wanted you to come back.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.482
I can handle myself.
You said you wanted help.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.483
No, I didn't want you
to give up on this place,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.927
on these people, to be afraid.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.287
You were right.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.848
So I'm here now.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.004
And I'm going out there
and I'm helping you.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.848
We have to get her
off that platform.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.002
She's hurt. She needs help
getting over the wall.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.528
I can climb up the gate.
You can distract them.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.284
We do it together.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.842
( Chuckles )
I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.683
You keep looking
for the Bible Glock...

16:21.920 --> 16:24.207
I'll make her something
to climb down.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.045
Okay.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.807
I like what you said before.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.201
That I wasn't born this way.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.929
You're right.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.765
Ichanged.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.049
And now I want
to help you change.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.205
<i>He'! '</i>

16:59.400 --> 17:01.050
You were right.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.971
Let's get Maggie.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.407
- Can't you just stay here?
- Nope.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.526
You've been given a gift,
Denise.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.801
You'll see that one day.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.088
Or maybe you won't.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.728
( Exhales )

17:37.360 --> 17:40.443
(growling )

18:14.200 --> 18:17.124
( growling continues )

18:43.680 --> 18:45.842
Carol's voice:
The monsters will come,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.606
and you won't be able to run away
when they come for you.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.010
The ones out there.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.845
And they will tear you apart
and eat you up

18:55.000 --> 18:57.162
all while you're still alive.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.761
(growling )

19:04.520 --> 19:07.410
Sam?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.847
Come on, come on.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.247
- Sweetheart? Sam?
- Rick: You can do it.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.606
- You can do it.
- Yes, you can.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.082
Sam.
Sam, come on.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.720
- Come on, Sam.
- Jessie: Sam.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.962
- Sam?
- Ron: Sam...

19:22.120 --> 19:25.283
hey, you can do this.
Sam, just look at Mom.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.283
Honey, you can do it.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.442
Sam, you're gonna get--
Sam, honey,

19:29.640 --> 19:31.608
- I need you to come with me.
- ( crying, whimpers)

19:31.760 --> 19:33.569
- Sam.
- Jessie: I need you to come with me.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.609
- I want to.
- Jessie: I need you to be strong.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.205
- Ron: Sam--
- ( snarling )

19:37.400 --> 19:38.970
( screams )
Mom!

19:39.120 --> 19:42.363
( Screaming echoes )

19:51.240 --> 19:55.404
( Silent )

19:58.320 --> 20:01.244
( Silent )

20:01.400 --> 20:05.086
- Eugene: Jessie?
- Rick: Jessie. Jessie.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.083
- No.
- Rick: Jessie. Jessie.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.685
Come with us.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.928
Come on.
We have to go.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.931
No.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.285
( Jessie screaming,
echoes )

20:21.440 --> 20:23.363
(munching )

20:23.520 --> 20:25.284
- No.
- ( screaming continues )

20:29.520 --> 20:31.090
(sobs)
No.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.043
Dad.
( grunts )

20:42.520 --> 20:45.444
( Carl grunting )

20:45.600 --> 20:47.045
Come on.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.450
Carl:
Dad.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.251
( Snarling )

21:09.960 --> 21:11.883
( hammer clicks )

21:14.800 --> 21:15.961
You.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.322
You.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.481
( Flesh squishes )

21:25.640 --> 21:26.846
( gunshot echoes )

21:29.480 --> 21:31.323
( blade rings )

21:35.600 --> 21:37.284
( snarling )

21:41.240 --> 21:44.369
Dad?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.602
( Gasps )
Carl.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.444
No.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.602
(grunting )

21:51.840 --> 21:53.842
(grunting )

22:02.280 --> 22:04.282
(walkers growling )

22:27.560 --> 22:32.168
Sooner or later,
we're fighting our way out.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.242
I know that you're fully aware
that we will.

22:37.400 --> 22:41.041
Yeah... we will.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.131
Not you.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.760
- Well, by my reckoning--
- Eugene.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.404
( Sighs )
Come on.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.568
They're moving towards the gunfire.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.846
That shout.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.163
I suppose someone thought
they could put up a fight.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.924
I guess you all thought that.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.203
We did put up a fight.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.761
That's why your friends are dead.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.611
Yeah.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.805
We should've waited
and watched a little longer.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.850
I was selfish.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.446
But maybe if I wasn't so selfish,

23:36.640 --> 23:38.768
I wouldn't have got that IV.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.010
We're gonna find a gap and go.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.970
Up that guard tower
and over the wall.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.482
You don't need to be afraid.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.651
Go to hell.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.007
You need to know

24:02.160 --> 24:04.322
it's safer out there
than it is in here.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.482
Start moving...

24:06.640 --> 24:08.847
start moving.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.925
Now, straight up that guard post

24:17.080 --> 24:19.765
and do not stop.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.490
Go.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.924
( Snarling )

24:32.440 --> 24:34.681
- ( snarling )
- Shit!

24:39.680 --> 24:42.001
( Screams )

24:45.520 --> 24:47.761
( panting )

24:47.960 --> 24:50.281
Let's go.
Come with me, now.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.887
You get me to the infirmary,
I save your life.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.610
I'll save your life.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.370
( Snarling )

25:19.880 --> 25:21.962
( sighs )

25:26.400 --> 25:27.925
( footsteps approach )

25:28.080 --> 25:30.082
( hammer clicks )

25:38.800 --> 25:40.245
( sighs )

25:46.400 --> 25:48.528
You had a child.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.729
Right?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.282
A husband?

26:04.160 --> 26:07.050
I didn't want to hurt you,
I just had to stop you.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.443
You saved him for you,
not us.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.206
If it was for us, you would've...

26:24.360 --> 26:27.489
I should've killed you.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.642
I should've.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.802
You can't.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.844
The infirmary's
right across the alley.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.843
We need to get you
there now.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.171
Hey!

27:03.320 --> 27:06.005
The ladder was clear.
Could've made it.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.527
You turned back for me.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.604
Maybe it was because
you needed a doctor,

27:11.760 --> 27:13.842
or maybe you changed.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.322
You ready?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.002
(growling )

27:30.200 --> 27:31.440
( snarling )

27:32.920 --> 27:34.206
Come on!
Come on!

27:34.360 --> 27:35.964
(gunshot)

27:36.120 --> 27:39.363
Go! Go!

27:39.520 --> 27:41.045
W man:
Go!

27:50.360 --> 27:51.885
Come on, come on.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.041
You okay?

27:53.200 --> 27:55.487
I'm fine.
How are my patients?

27:55.640 --> 27:57.563
They're doing well.
We moved them upstairs just in case.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.643
Oh, my God.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.730
Heath:
It's the kid.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.291
Is he bit?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.090
( Exhales )

28:15.480 --> 28:16.925
Nope.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.286
What?

28:18.440 --> 28:21.489
I need bandages.
Top shelf, next to the sink.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.405
Two IVs from the fridge
and all the clean towels you can find.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.562
Aaron, grab the gurney.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.489
This is a gunshot?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.529
Michonne:
Handgun. Close range.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.610
Please save him.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.250
Please.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.450
Spencer:
That's gonna draw them here.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.284
Denise:
I need light.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.330
Michonne, towel.
Hold it here.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.482
Okay, we need to keep pressure
on the wound.

28:55.640 --> 28:58.450
I'll go in and sew up
any lacerations.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.045
Just like that, right here.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.601
Now, Spencer, I need that pan.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.723
That one on the tray.
Good.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.848
I'm going to clean
and close this.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.049
Michonne, keep following me
with the towel.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.090
( Snarling )

29:25.960 --> 29:27.849
Michonne:
What-- what are you doing?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.331
Rick!

29:31.400 --> 29:32.890
( Voice echoes )
Rick...!

29:36.240 --> 29:39.323
( Walkers snarling )

29:41.200 --> 29:43.282
(grunting )

29:58.120 --> 29:59.804
- Rick's out there.
- Hold on.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.200
- He needs my help.
- Just one more suture.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.481
But he's out there.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.120
This is his son.
Give me a second.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.446
Aaron:
He's taking them all on.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.886
- We have to go get him.
- What?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.804
We have to.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.167
- This is it.
- Denise: Okay, got it.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.481
( Kisses )

30:18.240 --> 30:20.402
( snarling )

30:33.040 --> 30:35.407
(grunting )

31:07.600 --> 31:10.206
Knock 'em away.
Drive 'em down.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.087
We can beat 'em.
We can beat 'em!

31:25.960 --> 31:28.201
Rick:
Drive 'em back. That's it.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.402
We can do this together!

31:32.440 --> 31:35.444
(crying )

31:35.600 --> 31:37.602
Will you take her?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.561
Of course.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.927
Come with me.
Okay, okay.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.969
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.644
Gabriel.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.002
What are you doing?

31:58.360 --> 32:01.762
We've been praying...
together.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.289
Praying that God
will save our town.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.411
Well, our prayers
have been answered.

32:10.560 --> 32:14.804
God will save Alexandria...

32:14.960 --> 32:18.123
because God has given us
the courage to save it ourselves.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.806
Guys, it's thinning
out there in front.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.883
We need to get out there.
Rick's making a stand.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.407
- Eugene: How's that?
- He's out there fighting them

32:35.560 --> 32:38.848
with Michonne and some others.
It's time.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.207
Up the alley. I'm going.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.169
Denise is safe.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.685
Did you see her?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.207
Yeah, she made it
to the infirmary.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.482
- I'm gonna go help Rick.
- I'm going, too.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.608
- Tara: I'm with you.
- Rosita: All right, me, too.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.366
- Eugene: Right behind you.
- Eugene, you don't have to.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.648
That's incorrect.
I do.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.802
No one gets to clock out today.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.646
And, hell, this is a story
people are gonna tell.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.848
( Walkers snarling )

33:12.120 --> 33:13.884
This way! Come on!

33:17.760 --> 33:20.240
( Snarling )

33:24.200 --> 33:26.089
I'm sorry.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.370
No.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.050
( Gasping )

33:37.240 --> 33:40.722
Go get her!

33:43.120 --> 33:45.168
- Hey!
- ( gunshots )

33:45.320 --> 33:47.288
Over here!

33:48.600 --> 33:49.726
Come on, here!

33:51.640 --> 33:53.051
- Over here!
- Glenn!

No! Glenn!

Just go!
Just get over!

34:17.840 --> 34:18.887
M <i>' Go!</i>

34:19.040 --> 34:20.724

34:27.679 --> 34:29.967
- ( gun clicks)
- Shit.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.248
- No, Glenn!
- Go!

34:45.960 --> 34:47.962
(machine-gun fire)

34:53.040 --> 34:55.725
Can you get the gate?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.087
Appreciate it, pal.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.089
(laughing)

35:07.240 --> 35:09.322
Come on, we got you.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.204
- ( Panting )
- What the hell happened?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.681
I don't know.
I just got back.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.968
Listen... we can--

35:23.120 --> 35:25.851
we can lead some of them away,
but they're scattered.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.129
No, we get 'em all together.
Won't have to lead 'em away.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.525
( Walkers snarling )

35:51.200 --> 35:53.487
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( grunts )

36:10.760 --> 36:12.603
( snarling )

36:35.520 --> 36:38.000
Move it! Back up!

36:42.040 --> 36:43.883
All right, that's it!

37:19.160 --> 37:20.924
( Muffled )
Don't let up!

37:21.080 --> 37:23.003
( Muffled shouting,
grunting )

38:09.840 --> 38:12.161
(grunting )

39:36.360 --> 39:39.967
I was wrong.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.411
I thought after living behind
these walls for so long that...

39:48.600 --> 39:50.648
maybe they couldn't learn.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.771
But today...

39:56.920 --> 40:00.003
I saw what they could do,

40:00.160 --> 40:04.131
what we could do,

40:04.280 --> 40:06.647
if we work together.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.410
We'll rebuild the walls.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.728
We'll expand the walls.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.365
There will be more.
There's gotta be more.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.810
Everything Deanna
was talking about...

40:27.120 --> 40:29.964
is possible.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.602
It's all possible.
I see that now.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.808
When I was out there...

40:44.320 --> 40:48.006
with them...

40:48.160 --> 40:50.242
when it was over...

40:52.880 --> 40:57.488
when I knew
we had this place again...

41:00.480 --> 41:03.006
I had this feeling.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.691
It took me a while

41:10.840 --> 41:14.367
to remember what it was...

41:14.520 --> 41:16.727
because I haven't felt it

41:16.880 --> 41:20.646
since before I woke up
in that hospital bed.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.049
(sobs)
I want to show you

41:26.200 --> 41:28.885
the new world, Carl.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.005
I want to make it
a reality for you.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.921
Please, Carl...

41:44.040 --> 41:45.530
let me show you.

41:45.680 --> 41:50.083
Plea-- please, son,
don't die.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.924
( Theme music playing )
