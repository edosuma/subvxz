<i>Because I am never ever going</i>
<i>to talk about her. Ever.</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:05.238
Now, you can expect
four more of these quizzes

-Is that even legal?

One final thing, all remaining quizzes

I'm attempting to foster collaboration,

-Why?

15:48.739 --> 15:51.409
Timmy doesn't study, he'll tank our grade.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.662
Grades are the least of my concerns,
Rollo Tookus.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.581
What are your concerns, Timmy?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.087
I cannot collaborate
with The Nameless One.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.841
Well, I don't know
what that means exactly,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.218
but I'm sure
we can problem solve the situation.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.597
Molly Moskins, do you have something
you'd like to share?

16:14.390 --> 16:18.019
No, but Timmy does.
And I think he should be heard.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.563
Oh, well,

16:21.022 --> 16:24.775
if something is troubling you,
Mr. Failure, then by all means,

16:24.859 --> 16:27.195
stand up and share. Stand up.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.493
Well, speak up, Failure.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.537
We're all waiting.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.128
-You can do it, Timmy.
-Say something, Timmy.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.257
As I expected. Now sit down, Failure.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.135
TIMMY: <i> But sitting with The Nameless One</i>
<i>was not an option.</i>

16:52.011 --> 16:53.095
Sit down...

16:53.888 --> 16:55.515
or go to the Principal's office.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.142
So, I was forced to improvise.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.812
What are you doing now?

17:02.813 --> 17:04.773
Sitting down, but over here.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.486
All right. That's it. Get out.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.392
I'm going to be delayed.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.355
Now, by my estimation,

18:26.439 --> 18:30.901
we've had 11 meetings so far this year,

18:31.319 --> 18:35.990
and neither Timmy's grades
nor his behavior are improving.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.910
And worse, he doesn't seem to care.

I know it may not seem like it sometimes,
but Timmy does care.

He just... he cares in a...
a different way.

Hmm, well, be that as it may,

we're gonna have to suspend him.

that's over. Finished.

41:26.073 --> 41:29.362
TIMMY: <i> Facing a code red situation.</i>
<i>I improvised.</i>

41:29.654 --> 41:31.155
I lent it to Molly Moskins.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.783
Uh, who's Molly Moskins?

41:34.909 --> 41:36.035
A girl in my class.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.539
She needed it for her stupid rally.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.793
Timmy that was...
that was not yours to lend.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.463
It's not my fault.
She smells like a tangerine.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.216
Who does? Molly Moskins?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.051
Affirmative.

41:52.301 --> 41:55.680
Timmy, I told you never to touch
my Segway, right?

41:56.144 --> 41:58.516
And... and... I'm glad
that you're getting involved in school,

41:58.599 --> 42:00.309
but this kind of behavior has got to stop.

42:00.435 --> 42:04.313
-(PHONE RINGS)
-Okay, this is work. I have to take this.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.525
I want my Segway back,
the moment that rally is done.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.531
And I'm calling Molly Moskins's mother.

42:16.826 --> 42:18.703
And don't go anywhere.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.414
TIMMY: <i>If she was calling</i>
<i>Molly Moskins's mother,</i>

42:21.497 --> 42:23.332
<i>I had to get to Molly first...</i>

42:27.754 --> 42:28.838
<i>and make a deal.</i>

42:34.052 --> 42:35.595
<i>A seedy backroom deal.</i>

42:37.388 --> 42:38.389
MOLLY: Tea?

42:39.724 --> 42:41.059
Can we stick to business?

42:42.182 --> 42:43.185
Okay.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.272
So, you want me to tell my mom
to tell your mom,

42:46.397 --> 42:48.232
that we're using your Segway in the rally?

42:48.649 --> 42:49.776
Correct.

42:50.443 --> 42:51.736
Why did you choose me?

42:52.987 --> 42:54.405
My agency chose you.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.199
Talent agency?

42:57.355 --> 43:00.066
-Detective agency.
-Oh!

43:00.328 --> 43:03.414
Did you hear about the purse snatchings?
I saw it on the news.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.792
I deal with bigger cases...
Holy smokes!

43:06.542 --> 43:08.753
That's my cat, Señor Burrito.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.254
Is it trained?

43:10.902 --> 43:15.051
Aw, she likes you. Probably because
you're odd and mysterious.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.762
Get it off me, before I'm mauled.

43:18.471 --> 43:20.598
Señor Burrito, <i>vamonos, vamonos.</i>

43:23.309 --> 43:25.645
-Isn't this fun?
-It's business.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.314
The future of my agency is at stake.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.984
Okay, okay.
So, you want me to be your cover.

43:32.819 --> 43:33.861
Affirmative.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.115
Well, my answer is yes.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.742
I will cover you anytime, Timmy.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.664
Be professional, Molly.

43:46.833 --> 43:47.834
Fine.

43:49.710 --> 43:50.837
I'll be professional.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.508
If you want my help, you have to sign up
for the Animal Awareness rally.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.677
-Negative.
-And...

44:03.724 --> 44:06.227
-you have to paint my nails.
-Absurd!

44:06.610 --> 44:09.071
And when we're done,
I'm going to paint your nails.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.315
I think you've had too much tea.

44:12.338 --> 44:14.163
You want me to be your cover, don't you?

44:14.443 --> 44:17.613
Well, right now your cover
isn't feeling very cover-y.

44:22.618 --> 44:26.747
TIMMY: <i>Blackmail comes in many shades.</i>
<i>Including hot pink.</i>

44:35.464 --> 44:38.092
-Did you study?
-Negative.

44:39.385 --> 44:40.553
We had a deal.

44:45.725 --> 44:48.436
-Would you help me with the bank?
-No way.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.439
No bank, no deal.

44:51.689 --> 44:52.732
MR. CROCUS: Failure...

44:54.108 --> 44:55.651
no talking.

44:56.861 --> 44:59.280
I wasn't talking, I was mouthing.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.491
No mouthing, either.

45:09.081 --> 45:11.209
ROLLO: <i> If my mom finds out</i>
<i>I went downtown,</i>

45:11.584 --> 45:13.628
<i>-I'm dead.</i>
-TIMMY: <i>She won't.</i>

45:14.086 --> 45:16.923
You just say that because your mom
has no idea where you are.

45:17.256 --> 45:18.424
She works all the time.

45:18.925 --> 45:21.886
Negative. I say it because this mission
is highly classified.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.805
This is a bad idea. I just know it.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.433
Stop panicking. We have backup.

45:38.152 --> 45:42.114
It's a vast complex.
Numerous points of ingress and egress.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.326
It's huge. This is nuts.

45:46.202 --> 45:47.245
Did you bring the marbles?

45:48.663 --> 45:49.664
Yes.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.875
-(CLATTERS)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

45:59.590 --> 46:01.217
What are these for anyway?

46:02.260 --> 46:04.887
Contingency plan. Let's put on the masks.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.516
These are just on loan, by the way.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.634
-ROLLO: Now what?
-TIMMY: Follow me.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.288
The Failure Mobile
is undoubtedly in the vault.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.041
ROLLO: People are staring at us.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.252
TIMMY: Jealous, ignore them.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.427
-ROLLO: What are you doing?
-TIMMY: Gathering intel.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.220
ROLLO: Good idea.

46:47.930 --> 46:48.931
Can I help you boys?

46:50.349 --> 46:54.145
TIMMY: Uh, we'd like to inspect
your vault. It's very important, Sir.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.731
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

46:57.189 --> 47:00.484
ROLLO: Okay. Then we'll just be
heading home. Right, Timmy?

47:01.193 --> 47:03.362
-TIMMY: Negative.
-Would you mind removing your masks?

47:03.821 --> 47:06.407
-ROLLO: Why?
-Bank policy. No masks.

47:08.034 --> 47:09.577
We need to see everyone's face.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.621
-TIMMY: We're being watched.
-ROLLO: Of course we are!

47:12.705 --> 47:15.583
We're in a bank.
And we're wearing fencing masks.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.045
TIMMY: <i>That's when it hit me...</i>

47:20.713 --> 47:21.714
<i>it was a trap.</i>

47:24.842 --> 47:25.968
<i>We were surrounded.</i>

47:27.803 --> 47:29.180
<i>But who tipped them off?</i>

47:30.890 --> 47:33.726
<i>Of course, it was a family affair.</i>

47:35.394 --> 47:38.481
-TIMMY: Oh, no.
-You need to remove those masks, now.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.941
ROLLO: Timmy, we need to remove
our masks.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.778
-TIMMY: Never. Get ready.
-ROLLO: Get ready for what?

47:44.153 --> 47:45.154
TIMMY: The diversion.

47:46.822 --> 47:49.283
-Plastic?
-ROLLO: Yeah, it's safer.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.747
TIMMY: It's an ambush, run!

47:55.136 --> 47:57.291
-SECURITY OFFICER: Hey, stop!
-ROLLO: Why did you do that?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.168
-TIMMY: Thank me later.
-ROLLO: I can't breathe.

47:59.251 --> 48:01.420
-TIMMY: Keep your mask on.
-ROLLO: I'm suffocating!

48:02.213 --> 48:05.591
Papa Bear! Papa Bear!
Papa Bear! Need backup.

48:06.634 --> 48:07.968
Repeat, need backup.

48:09.553 --> 48:14.266
Okay, Timmy. Classified information,
bugs, armor-plated desks.

48:15.017 --> 48:16.372
I have to ask.

48:16.894 --> 48:17.937
Are you a spy?

48:18.813 --> 48:20.523
-Negative.
-Don't worry.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.859
I had the place swept for bugs.
We can talk freely.

48:25.611 --> 48:26.654
I'm a detective.

48:27.988 --> 48:30.783
Ah! Yes, that makes sense.

48:32.498 --> 48:34.161
So, you're having trouble
with your agency.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.497
-Affirmative.
-How so?

48:37.456 --> 48:39.166
Someone is attempting to sabotage it.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.752
-Do you know who?
-I can't discuss it with you.

48:43.212 --> 48:44.588
Ongoing investigation.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.299
But the success of my agency is at stake.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.009
Oh, yeah?

48:50.094 --> 48:51.387
What is your idea of success?

48:52.304 --> 48:53.305
Greatness.

48:55.138 --> 48:57.113
Have you talked to your mom
about any of this?

48:58.853 --> 48:59.854
Why not?

49:00.604 --> 49:03.107
She's collaborating
with local law enforcement.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.786
Mother, can I have a tissue?

49:22.918 --> 49:24.628
He's low level, but very corrupt.

49:26.172 --> 49:27.506
Also he maims rabbits.

49:28.466 --> 49:29.508
Hmm.

49:30.551 --> 49:33.471
Well, I know this is probably
not the best time to ask but...

49:34.972 --> 49:36.515
is there any chance I could hire you?

49:37.266 --> 49:38.350
What's the case?

49:39.173 --> 49:41.323
I'd like you to do
a little undercover work for me,

49:41.562 --> 49:42.897
in Mr. Crocus's class.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.651
-You want intel.
-Yeah, I want intel.

49:48.194 --> 49:49.195
How in depth?

49:49.361 --> 49:51.322
Let's start with the homework
he's assigning you.

49:51.502 --> 49:53.449
I want to see it,
make sure it's on the up and up.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.910
-Completed homework?
-Yes, completed.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.703
That will definitely cost more.

50:03.292 --> 50:06.712
All right, people. Lock it down.
Lock it down!

50:07.671 --> 50:10.299
Hey, we've got a rally to plan,
and awareness to raise.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.302
Now, who are my domesticated animals?
Raise your hands.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.139
Good. Who are my wild animals?

50:18.641 --> 50:20.392
All right, is that everyone?

50:21.727 --> 50:22.728
Yes, you.

50:22.978 --> 50:26.607
I don't know what group this is exactly,
but I'd like to do a tribute

50:26.690 --> 50:28.400
to Hammy Ham, our class hamster.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.528
He's dead...

50:31.487 --> 50:34.490
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

50:34.782 --> 50:36.075
...of natural causes.

50:37.117 --> 50:39.954
I like it. Very thoughtful.
Molly, take a note.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.288
Copy.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.124
FLO: Timmy, what group are you in?

50:44.708 --> 50:47.294
-I'm in no group.
-You have to be in a group.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.964
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.049
Not if he's protesting.

50:52.716 --> 50:53.884
What is he protesting?

50:54.635 --> 50:56.387
Probably the anti-bear policy.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.973
There's an anti-bear policy?

50:59.473 --> 51:01.600
Absolutely, I've heard about it, too.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.561
-From who?
-Timmy.

51:04.520 --> 51:08.357
Okay. Timmy, can you tell us
about the anti-bear policy?

51:10.985 --> 51:11.986
Timmy?

51:12.695 --> 51:15.864
Listen, if you feel strongly
about something, you have to speak out.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.491
Right? Why do you think I'm here?

51:18.117 --> 51:21.120
Because I like you? No. Definitely not.

51:21.662 --> 51:25.249
It's because I want to teach you guys
to make an impact on the world.

51:25.499 --> 51:30.129
Because if you don't,
we are collectively screwed. You got it?

51:31.464 --> 51:32.506
Timmy.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.720
Come on.
Buddy, you gotta give me something.

51:40.055 --> 51:41.056
Affirmative.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.392
All right, I'll take it.

51:43.851 --> 51:46.659
All right, people, let's get up.
Let's get to work! Got a lot to do.

51:46.784 --> 51:48.480
Come on, get to your tables.

51:48.897 --> 51:50.733
We've got two weeks
to get this rally together,

51:50.858 --> 51:52.192
that's not a lot of time.

51:52.693 --> 51:56.113
TIMMY: <i>But that was a profound</i>
<i>understatement. Time was running out.</i>

51:56.655 --> 52:00.034
<i>I had to liberate the Failure Mobile</i>
<i>from the bank, tonight.</i>

52:00.993 --> 52:04.747
<i>And that meant sending my bear,</i>
<i>who was often unreliable.</i>

52:05.456 --> 52:07.875
<i>I told him to avoid well-lit places.</i>

52:09.043 --> 52:10.127
<i>He did not listen.</i>

52:11.712 --> 52:15.341
<i>I advised him to steer clear</i>
<i>of any obvious entrance.</i>

52:17.009 --> 52:18.218
<i>He did not listen.</i>

52:19.261 --> 52:22.681
<i>And I urged him to avoid any distractions.</i>

52:23.891 --> 52:25.809
<i>Once again, he did not listen.</i>

52:27.853 --> 52:31.273
<i>But most importantly, I told him</i>
<i>to approach the Failure Mobile</i>

52:31.482 --> 52:33.817
<i>with caution and the utmost delicacy.</i>

52:38.322 --> 52:39.782
<i>But he was too fat.</i>

53:05.849 --> 53:07.017
How you doing, buddy?

53:09.186 --> 53:10.229
What are you doing here?

53:10.760 --> 53:13.273
Well, I was working in the area,
I thought you might want a ride home.

TIMMY: <i>A good detective</i>
<i>always keeps his enemies close.</i>

53:17.820 --> 53:20.572
<i>-Sometimes, too close.</i>
-How was school?

53:22.408 --> 53:23.409
You have some fun?

53:25.327 --> 53:26.328
Good times?

53:27.496 --> 53:30.958
Hey, do you like bear claws?
Picked some up at the bakery today.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.543
They're yummy.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.962
-What now?
-His claws.

53:35.504 --> 53:37.881
They've all been... clipped.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.511
No chance.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.932
Oh, do you bowl? You ever been bowling?

53:47.349 --> 53:49.184
I could take you bowling,
give you some tips.

53:54.022 --> 53:57.025
Hey, Timmy, you know, I know,
it's weird I'm dating your mom.

53:57.818 --> 54:00.320
It's weird that you want to give me
tips on bowling.

54:01.989 --> 54:02.990
Fair enough.

54:03.699 --> 54:06.118
I... I just want you to know though,
that I... really like her.

54:06.702 --> 54:10.622
She's so smart, and cool,
and funny, and pretty.

54:12.004 --> 54:14.460
I'm actually kinda surprised
she likes spending time with me.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.795
Not that I am a bad guy at all.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.214
I'm not, I just got
some stuff I'm working out.

54:19.923 --> 54:22.134
Even been going to therapy,
which is going great.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.554
I just feel like people think
because we issue tickets

54:25.971 --> 54:30.476
that meter maids don't care.
But we do... care a lot.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.853
About everything, I'm not robot.

54:33.145 --> 54:34.521
-Hmm.
-Actually, I've been thinking

54:34.646 --> 54:37.900
about robots a lot lately.
About how they could take over everything.

54:38.358 --> 54:41.111
You know, Timmy.
When someone opens up like that...

54:42.154 --> 54:43.781
to you, like, then you can say something.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.909
-Like what?
-Oh, like,

54:47.034 --> 54:49.397
you know, "Thank you for sharing,"
something like that.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.998
-Thank you for sharing.
-Yeah, that's a normal thing to do.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.710
-Normal's for normal people.
-What does that mean?

54:57.377 --> 55:00.589
It means you're normal.
And my mother doesn't like normal people.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.968
Okay. Okay.

55:11.058 --> 55:14.770
So, first of all, just so you know,
I'm not that normal.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.481
I'm a nice parking enforcement officer,
which is rare.

55:18.065 --> 55:21.777
And, secondly, what you said,
that was kind of mean.

55:22.319 --> 55:24.780
-I've never been mean to you.
-Yes, you have.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.532
What? When?

55:27.282 --> 55:29.535
-You just kidnapped me for starters.
-Oh!

55:29.868 --> 55:31.745
You dis... No, I didn't kidnap you, buddy.

55:31.870 --> 55:34.373
No this isn't... I'm just taking you home
from school.

55:34.503 --> 55:35.666
You can get out any time you want.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.626
I never forced you to...

55:38.335 --> 55:39.586
Timmy, oh!

55:41.797 --> 55:42.881

55:43.799 --> 55:45.175

55:50.681 --> 55:54.560

-Hey.
-Hello, Mother.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.069
Doing your homework, that's great.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.989
Case work. New client.

56:13.287 --> 56:15.747
So, I heard what happened today
with Crispin.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.208
-Do you want to talk about it?
-Negative.

56:19.918 --> 56:23.130
Timmy, I know it's not easy for you
having someone new around,

56:23.213 --> 56:24.381
but I really like Crispin.

56:25.465 --> 56:27.843
He's... he's a sweet guy
and we have fun together.

56:28.427 --> 56:31.555

It was nice.

I hope you're not doing anything foolish.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.737
No. No, no, I'm not. I'm... I promise.

56:50.282 --> 56:54.494
(SIGHS) Timmy, I got to talk to you
about something else. It's important.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.624
We gotta move, Timmy.

56:59.791 --> 57:02.377
-Impossible.
-No, it's not.

57:02.836 --> 57:05.756
They're raising our rent again,
and I just... I can't afford it.

57:06.590 --> 57:07.674
What about my office?

57:08.397 --> 57:10.222
You... Well, you'll have to
make a new one.

57:10.677 --> 57:11.720
I can't do that!

57:12.054 --> 57:13.221
I have a very heavy case load,

57:13.347 --> 57:15.777
-this is not a good time for me.
-But we don't have a choice.

57:15.974 --> 57:18.060
And besides,
I found a nice apartment nearby,

57:18.185 --> 57:19.603
and you can still walk to school.

57:19.983 --> 57:21.883
What does school have to do
with any of this?

57:22.064 --> 57:25.400
-I'm talking about my agency!
-Timmy, I know it's not easy...

57:25.525 --> 57:28.904
I can't just move my business
at the drop of a hat.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.949
Not to mention, I'll have to make
new business cards. These are useless.

-Timmy.

-Yes?
-Do you have security at this site?

59:04.166 --> 59:08.879
Security? Yeah. Your bus stopped
at our guard station on the way in.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.673
-Is that it?
-Well...

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.921
you're gonna start acting
like a normal kid.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.008
And normal is for normal people,
you told me that.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.385
I was wrong! I was wrong, Timmy!

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:21.805
You have got to fit in,
you've got to grow up.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.975
Do you understand?

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:29.104
-Affirmative.
-I didn't hear you!

Yes.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:47.540
<i>I lost my agency.</i>

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.005
<i>That meant no more clients.</i>

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.216
<i>No more office.</i>

Crocus is gone.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:10.957
-That’s his replacement.
-She said he's on vacation.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.293
But I think it's because of what happened
with you at the dam.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.963

Good.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:45.671
I'll get dinner ready then.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:47.577

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:04.755
Go to middle school.

Because you're different.

That's right. Your life is big...

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:23.649
and original, and weird, and you.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.528
I don't have a choice.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.989
I had to close the agency.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.242
(SIGHS) That's a bad break.

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:36.287
I suppose it had something to do
with the dam, getting suspended.

-Mistakes were made.
-By you.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.964
You left that part out.
Agency or no agency,

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.258
you make a mistake, you own it.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.053
Then you learn from it and adapt.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.931
-Adapt?
-Absolutely.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:58.434
You see, professionals take
whatever the world throws at them

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.020
and they use it to become
a better version of themselves.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.522
Like I did when my car got stolen.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.691
That's right.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.985

Sucked.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.988
You should've contacted my agency.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.032
I didn't know you then.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.492
The point is,

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.453
after the car got stolen
I had no way to get to work.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:19.372
But I love my work.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.958
Like you. It's who I am.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.627
So I adapted.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.088
Started riding my bike to school.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.424
Wasn't gonna let a stolen car stop me.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.303
And I lost ten pounds
from bike riding so...

01:14:35.093 --> 01:14:36.180
it's all good.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.309
-You lost ten pounds?
-Yes, I lost ten pounds.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:45.064
So, I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your business, okay?

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.526
But I do know, if you love what you do...

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.528
you gotta fight for it.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.239
And if something isn't working,
you gotta adapt.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.241
You do that,

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:59.245
then no one can take away your agency.
Not your mother, not Mr. Crocus.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:01.956

A Russian agent stole the Failure Mobile,

so she could destroy my agency
and achieve her master plan.

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.131
That forced me to part ways

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:16.924
I want him back.

-You did? That's good.

I'm just happy that you're safe.

I thought something bad
had happened to you.

what happened.

-I'm sorry.

Yes. I was just trying to get

I stumbled upon something

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:27.534
you might be interested in. It's...

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:30.746
It's Russia related.

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:36.042
TIMMY: My mother will be at the rally,
for your information.

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.169
CRISPIN: Oh, yeah?

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.379
-She still mad at me?
-TIMMY: Affirmative.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:43.091
-But the ice is breaking.
-Yeah. I really screwed up.

-Mistakes were made.
-Yeah. Story of my life.

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:47.729
Mine too.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:52.392
It was illegally parked.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:54.436
Impossible.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.314
-Did you tell my mother?
-No.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.274
I just saw it this morning
during inventory.

to put this all together.

And I'm damn proud of them.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:53.870

-MOLLY: Thank you.
-Or my Segway, for that matter.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.145
-Oh, yeah.
-MOLLY: Welcome, everyone.

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:20.397
-What?
-Nothing.

01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:24.526
We, the students
of Carverette Elementary School,

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:29.698
urge you to join us in celebrating
the glory that is the animal world,

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.951
in our commitment
to wildlife conservation.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.372
We dedicate this rally
to our late class hamster,

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.249
the beloved Hammy Ham.

01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:41.251
May his soul rest in peace.

01:29:43.359 --> 01:29:48.049
And now, please welcome to the stage,
Timmy Failure.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:49.968

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:55.804
There's Timmy. And he has your Segway.

Oh, boy.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:21.166
Please be advised that this school
has a "no polar bear" policy on campus.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.376
That is not just.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.086
I'm gonna kill him.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.881
You're the one who told him
to stand up and be heard.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.010
A polar bear may be different.
He may be lazy.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:36.348
He may eat garbage
and he may have a poor attitude.

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.226
But, he is also a vulnerable species

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:42.228
and worth protecting.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:49.861
For a polar bear is loyal, and noble,
and capable of greatness.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.368
In fact, all of the animals in this rally
are capable of greatness.

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.416
-Right on.
-Oh, he's so delicious.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:07.462
So, it may be time for us to move on
to middle school.

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:11.216
It may be time for us to adapt
to a new way of life.

01:31:11.855 --> 01:31:15.428
But it will never be time for us
to stop being us.

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:23.019
You can tell that to our parents,
you can tell that to our teachers,

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.146
and you can tell that to the Russians.

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:28.650
Go, Timmy!

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:33.822

God bless Portland,

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.491
