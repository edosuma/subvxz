That's why I told you
to turn your chest to the wall.

36:20.793 --> 36:23.344
If that had hit you
in the side

36:23.413 --> 36:25.586
we'd be scooping you into
a body bag with a shovel...

36:25.655 --> 36:27.620
- That's...
Pretty fucking descriptive.

36:27.689 --> 36:29.379
- Can you get up?
We ain't done.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.448
- Yeah.

36:36.137 --> 36:39.034
- I'd call for EMS, but I can't
reach for my radio, Kacey.

36:39.103 --> 36:41.448
- It's okay, come here.
Come here. Back slow.

36:43.965 --> 36:46.689
Dispatch, this
is one-one-zero, Code 3.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.896
Two officers down,
multiple GSW.

36:48.965 --> 36:51.586
Send EMS and all available
units to my 20.

36:51.655 --> 36:52.620
- Copy one-one-zero.

36:52.689 --> 36:53.413
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

36:53.482 --> 36:54.793
- Just stay still.

36:54.862 --> 36:55.655
- Please advise if
your 20 has changed.

36:55.724 --> 36:56.862
- Twenty is the same.

37:38.931 --> 37:42.448
Jamie: You always
preached the truth.

37:42.517 --> 37:44.586
You said it's all a man has.

37:46.034 --> 37:47.103
His word.

37:49.896 --> 37:53.586
Judge him by nothing else.

37:57.827 --> 38:00.379
Are there different rules
for judging you?

38:02.241 --> 38:06.206
Or is some other definition
of truth that I'm unaware of?

38:06.275 --> 38:08.310
- You know the truth
and what it means.

38:08.379 --> 38:11.482
- All right, I don't know
the truth.

38:13.724 --> 38:14.862
I just know lies.

38:16.655 --> 38:20.482
I know the lie you told me
every day of my life.

38:20.551 --> 38:23.896
And worse, if that's possible,

38:23.965 --> 38:27.413
the lie you had me tell you.

38:28.724 --> 38:33.586
Every. Day. Of my life.

38:33.655 --> 38:35.241
- What lie is that, Son?

38:37.034 --> 38:39.965
- That. That's the lie.

38:41.724 --> 38:45.344
You called me son,
and you made me call you father.

38:46.896 --> 38:48.275
- Sit down.

38:48.344 --> 38:49.724
- You don't get to tell me
what do to anymore--

38:49.793 --> 38:52.620
- Then get the FUCK
out of my house.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.931
You can sit in my living room
or you can leave it.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.758
Those are your options.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.172
When a bull breeds a cow,
we don't call the calf its son.

39:19.241 --> 39:23.310
The bull is the sire.
The calf is its offspring.

39:23.379 --> 39:25.000
That's all.

39:25.068 --> 39:28.413
The cow, well, she...
she is the mother.

39:28.482 --> 39:30.310
Because she fed it.
Protected it.

39:30.379 --> 39:34.655
Cared for it.
Loved it.

39:34.724 --> 39:36.379
She deserves to be
called mother.

39:36.448 --> 39:38.413
But the bull... He's...

39:38.482 --> 39:40.344
He's just a bull.

39:40.413 --> 39:43.206
That's all.
And that's all he'll ever be.

39:47.827 --> 39:49.896
Your mother never got
a chance to love you.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.310
You were three months old
when he beat her to death

39:56.379 --> 39:57.655
with a shower head.

40:00.586 --> 40:03.379
The woman who
loved you and fed you

40:03.448 --> 40:07.034
and protected you was my wife.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.620
And me.

40:10.689 --> 40:13.275
I protected you.
I taught you.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.793
I guided you.

40:14.862 --> 40:17.103
I gave you love and kindness
and everything your future

40:17.172 --> 40:19.103
was guaranteed to be without.

40:19.172 --> 40:21.241
So you can call me whatever
you want, Jamie.

40:21.310 --> 40:25.172
But I will call you son

40:25.241 --> 40:27.448
because I have
earned the right.

40:30.068 --> 40:32.172
And earning it has been the
hardest thing I've ever done.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.137
- Did you know him?

40:37.206 --> 40:40.758
- Yeah, I knew him.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.931
And when he married the woman
who gave birth to you...

40:43.000 --> 40:46.241
We all begged her not to do it
because we knew.

40:47.862 --> 40:51.206
But I guess she thought
she could save him.

40:51.275 --> 40:54.000
Why she wanted to bother
in the first place,

40:54.068 --> 40:56.137
I don't know.

40:56.206 --> 40:59.896
I don't know how to explain
the chemistry of attraction.

40:59.965 --> 41:01.724
The thing that drives
us to do the very thing

41:01.793 --> 41:03.482
that will kill us.

41:05.689 --> 41:07.172
I can't explain it to you,

41:07.241 --> 41:08.379
because I don't
understand it myself.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.620
But you are in a unique
position, Jamie.

41:15.689 --> 41:17.758
Pretty much everyone at one
point or another,

41:17.827 --> 41:21.586
whether just mad
or curious,

41:21.655 --> 41:24.000
wonders what life would be
like with different parents.

41:26.172 --> 41:28.448
You actually have the
opportunity to choose.

41:30.896 --> 41:32.448
You're a resourceful man, Son.

41:32.517 --> 41:34.448
So, if he's still alive
I'm sure you can find him.

41:38.172 --> 41:41.758
And you can look into
his black fucking heart.

41:41.827 --> 41:43.689
His rotten...

41:48.068 --> 41:50.724
You can look into his eyes,
Jamie, and you get to choose.

41:53.103 --> 41:54.655
You can choose
who you call father.

42:02.862 --> 42:04.103
Goddamn, I'm tired.

42:07.310 --> 42:09.344
In my soul, I still feel young.

42:20.862 --> 42:22.275
so damn tired.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.241
I never thought
I'd be tired of living

42:27.310 --> 42:30.551
while I was still
strong enough to do it.

42:44.310 --> 42:45.413
