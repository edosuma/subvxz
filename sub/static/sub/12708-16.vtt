WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.802
-Previously...
-SPIKE: Buffy.

00:02.835 --> 00:04.504
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.240
-Tell me you love me.
-I love you.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.176
-Tell me you want me.
-I always want you.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.080
Anya, you want to marry me?

00:12.112 --> 00:13.680
Yes.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.648
-We're getting married.
-WILLOW: Congratulations.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.550
Wedding. One week.

00:17.585 --> 00:21.155
We have friends, family,
demons flying in, a to-do list
getting no shorter.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.224
Can-- can we not do this now?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.759
TARA:
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.096
WILLOW:
Are you saying
you're gonna leave me?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.429
Big wedding coming up.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.998
You and Tara
are speaking again.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.667
You wanna call her,
invite her over?

00:33.701 --> 00:37.104
Oh, no. Too soon
for so bold a maneuver.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.906
-It's over.
-I've memorized
this tune, love.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.875
I'm using you,
and it's killing me.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.414
I'm sorry, William.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.456
I know there has been
a lot of loss.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.426
People have a tendency
to go away.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.795
And sometimes I wish
I could just make them stop.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.798
Wish granted.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.700
(thunderclap)

01:07.734 --> 01:10.037
B-- Buffy, it's hideous.

01:10.069 --> 01:13.774
Oh, my God, Buffy.
Look at its arms.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.308
I know.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.579
But it's my duty.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.914
I'm Buffy
the Bridesmaid.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.450
(thunderclap)

01:22.483 --> 01:24.117
Duty schmooty.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.953
I'm supposed to be
best man.

01:25.986 --> 01:29.489
Shouldn't I be
all Marlene Dietrichy
in a dashing tuxedo number?

01:29.522 --> 01:31.158
-No.
-(whimpers)

01:31.192 --> 01:33.093
That would be totally unfair.

01:33.127 --> 01:36.496
We must share equally
in the cosmic joke
that is bridesmaidsdom.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.731
-Oh.
-(whimpers)

01:38.765 --> 01:41.668
Well, maybe if I ask Anya,
I can still go

01:41.701 --> 01:44.737
with the traditional
blood larva and burlap.

01:44.771 --> 01:48.609
I mean, she was
a vengeance demon for,
like, a thousand years.

01:48.641 --> 01:52.945
She would know all
the most flattering larvae.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.816
What was she thinking?

01:55.848 --> 01:58.286
I think she's
probably too stressed
to be thinking right now,

01:58.319 --> 02:02.156
what with Xander's relatives
and her... demons.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.492
Oh, my God. Last night,
the rehearsal dinner.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.993
That was like a zoo
without the table manners,

02:07.027 --> 02:09.697
and I bet it got worse
after we left.

02:09.729 --> 02:14.033
I can't believe everyone bought
that story about Anya's people
being circus folk.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.537
You see the guy
with the tentacles?
What's he supposed to be?

02:16.569 --> 02:19.673
-Inky the Squid Boy?
-And Xander's family--

02:19.706 --> 02:22.342
I haven't seen them that bad
since my bat mitzvah.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.545
Did you see how much
they drank?

02:24.578 --> 02:28.080
Kinda. Mr. Harris
threw up in my purse.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.152
Oh!

02:36.088 --> 02:37.691
Ohh!

02:39.227 --> 02:43.364
You guys look so beautiful!

02:43.396 --> 02:46.667
-WILLOW: (groans)
-This is the happiest day
of my whole life!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.836
(thunderclap)

02:49.870 --> 02:51.204
You seen my cuff links,
Uncle Rory?

02:51.239 --> 02:53.206
Little metal deals,
hold my sleeves together.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.974
Oh, you don't want those.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.211
What you really want is Velcro.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.146
Did I ever tell you how
that was my idea?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.848
-Excuse me. Comin' through.
Hey, how you doin'?
-Good.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.419
Rory,
what you doin' there?

03:06.454 --> 03:08.556
Well, I'm tryin' to make myself
an Irish coffee,

03:08.588 --> 03:10.557
but this stupid thing
is on the fritz.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch it.
It's still plugged in.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.727
(gasps)

03:13.760 --> 03:15.496
Oh, God!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.730
Gotcha.

03:17.764 --> 03:21.235
Oh, is that broken?
You want me to take
a look at that?

03:21.269 --> 03:23.670
Knock yourself out
there, Kevin.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.939
Uh, that's, uh, Kroven.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.276
Right. Right. Kroven.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.712
Whoo!
(laughing)

03:32.746 --> 03:34.046
Oh!

03:35.615 --> 03:37.116
MR. HARRIS:
Xander, you're not ready yet?

03:37.150 --> 03:38.752
MRS. HARRIS:
Look at my hair!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.353
Of course I suppose
it doesn't really matter

03:40.388 --> 03:42.389
'cause I won't actually be
in any of the pictures.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.057
You'll be
in the pictures, Ma.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.594
-I think your hair
looks lovely.
-Oh!

03:47.627 --> 03:49.430
XANDER:
Hey, hey, hey, how's about
some breakfast?

03:49.462 --> 03:53.466
Oh, well, I guess
if I'm a little plump,
it doesn't matter

03:53.501 --> 03:54.768
'cause I won't
really be--

03:54.801 --> 03:56.969
You'll be in the pictures, Ma!

03:57.003 --> 03:58.771
That's one of hers, right?

03:58.805 --> 04:01.474
Hey! You're one
of hers, right?

04:01.508 --> 04:04.578
You met Kroven already,
Dad, last night.

04:04.611 --> 04:08.549
Yeah, we met.
You, uh, said I resembled
your mother-in-law.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.551
-Tony!
-Oh, yeah.

04:11.585 --> 04:15.756
And then you hit me
with a cocktail wiener
and insulted my heritage.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.824
Heritage?

04:17.858 --> 04:21.261
Being circus folks
is suddenly heritage now, huh?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.896
I mean no disrespect,
of course.

04:23.930 --> 04:28.502
I'm sure you come from
a long, proud line of geeks.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.103
I'm kidding!
Just kidding.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.673
Xander. Xander.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.141
You know that guy Kevin?

04:35.175 --> 04:40.514
If he could clear up
the skin problem,
do you think--

04:40.548 --> 04:43.115
do you suppose he'd date
a woman with a kid?

04:43.149 --> 04:46.252
I mean,
I really can't afford
to be very picky.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.090
Cousin Carol,
your earrings
are my cuff links.

04:50.122 --> 04:53.494
They are? Oh, my. Oops.

04:53.526 --> 04:57.398
Excellent.
Cuff links-- check.
We're rollin'.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.567
Now nothing on Earth
can stop this wedding now.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.978
(thunderclaps)

05:16.417 --> 05:17.718
(theme music playing)

06:10.137 --> 06:11.971
(grunts)
Is it too small?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.007
Nah.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.110
It fit when
I picked up the tux.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.545
How can it not fit now?

06:19.579 --> 06:21.548
It'll fit.

06:21.581 --> 06:25.018
Aw, man.
What if it doesn't? What if
I can't wear my cummerbund

06:25.052 --> 06:28.521
and then the whole world can see
the place where my pants
meet my shirt?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.557
Buffy,
that cannot happen!

06:30.591 --> 06:32.192
I must wear das cummerbund!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.927
And so... you... shall!

06:36.930 --> 06:40.567
-You got it!
-Slayer strength.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.137
I've been meaning to cut back
on that habit-forming oxygen.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.237
Look at you.

06:45.271 --> 06:48.576
You look great,
Mr. About To Get Married.

06:48.608 --> 06:49.476
You're glowing.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.480
Oh, my God.
Maybe you're pregnant!

06:53.514 --> 06:56.216
Maybe. I don't know.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.617
Maybe I'm just happy.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.958
Teary?

07:05.658 --> 07:06.494
Oh!

07:06.526 --> 07:07.961
(sniffles) Good.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.463
-Good teary.
-Happy teary?

07:10.497 --> 07:12.833
Not frustrated
with bow tie teary?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.935
Yes. Happy.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.237
Happy for you.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.807
That makes me happy for me.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.143
You and Anya give me hope.

07:23.175 --> 07:25.444
It's like
you two are proof

07:25.478 --> 07:26.779
that there's light
at the end

07:26.814 --> 07:30.216
of this very long, long,
nasty tunnel.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.122
And I cannot tie this tie.
Where's your best man?

07:35.154 --> 07:37.957
-Isn't she supposed to do this?
-She said she had
something important to do.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.995
Want me to
hold it shut for you?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.029
Oh, okay.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.768
Are you guys even listening?
I need feedback, people.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.836
Sorry.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.504
Please continue
with the vows.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.971
Okay. (clears throat)

07:52.004 --> 07:55.108
I, Anya, promise to...

07:55.141 --> 07:57.511
love you,
to cherish you,

07:57.545 --> 08:00.346
to honor you,
but not to obey you,
of course,

08:00.379 --> 08:02.382
because that's anachronistic
and misogynistic,

08:02.415 --> 08:03.449
and who do you
think you are,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.952
like, a sea captain
or something?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.855
-However, I do entrust you--
-(giggling)

08:07.887 --> 08:10.290
What?
Is something funny?

08:10.322 --> 08:15.127
No. N-Nothing, sweetie.
Just-- Just keep still.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.064
(clears throat)
Okay, blah, blah, blah.

08:17.096 --> 08:20.067
Misogynistic. Blah, blah.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.002
I do, however, entrust you
with my heart.

08:24.103 --> 08:27.040
Take care of my heart,
won't you, please?

08:27.074 --> 08:29.742
Take care of it because
it's all that I have,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.911
and, if you let me,

08:31.944 --> 08:34.815
I'll take care
of your heart too.

08:34.847 --> 08:39.219
I'll protect it and tend to it
like a little stray.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.221
Wait, no.
Like a little mangy stray
that needs a home.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.725
No, that's not it either.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.562
Um-- (clears throat)
I think we're all set here.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.099
Let's take a look at you.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.908
-Oh.
-Wow.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.510
You look lovely.
Really lovely.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.614
(sighs)
Thanks.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.416
It's probably the blush
of imprudent spending.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.184
Do you think Xander
will like it?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.254
-I want to see Xander now.
-WILLOW: You can't.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.923
It's bad luck for the groom

09:15.956 --> 09:18.057
to see the bride
in her dress, remember?

09:18.091 --> 09:21.894
Right. I can't keep
all these ridiculous
traditions straight.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.831
Well, what if I'm not
wearing my dress
when I see him?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.735
Okay, no sex.
Cuddling?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.437
It's just I'm so excited,

09:30.470 --> 09:32.404
and I want to share it all
with my best friend.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.741
I get to be with
my best friend forever.

09:34.774 --> 09:35.676
Yay!

09:43.182 --> 09:45.719
Guess who agreed to be
my date for tonight?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.988
I'm really supposed
to be working.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.790
-I'm one of the caterers.
-Oh, hush, hush.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.424
No woman of mine
is gonna work.

09:52.459 --> 09:56.129
All you have to do
is sit pretty and laugh
when I tell a good one.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.298
Tell her what a funny guy
I am, Dawnie.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.769
Gotta go.
Enjoy the wedding.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.772
(giggling)

10:06.139 --> 10:08.341
Oh, bad head.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.110
-What?
-The lip wasn't split right.

10:11.144 --> 10:15.115
You see, what you gotta do
is grab the lip between
your thumb and your finger,

10:15.148 --> 10:18.751
and then you have to slice
right through the center
of the meat.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.486
-Hmm.
-It was my trade.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.155
I used to stuff things.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.993
I still do,

10:26.025 --> 10:27.727
but only for fun.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.798
Hi.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.868
Oh. Hymen's greetings.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.302
Hy-what?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.336
Hymen.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.504
The god of matrimony.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.841
His salutations
upon you.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.476
May the love
we celebrate today avoid
an almost inevitable decline.

10:45.678 --> 10:46.779
Cool.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.947
I brought a gift.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.381
I suppose there's a table.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.451
Oh, uh--
Halfrek.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.221
Oh, please,
call me Hallie.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.289
We're practically
family now.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.359
Hmm. Neat.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.961
-I can put this
on the table for you.
-Thank you.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.662
-Careful. It's--
-Fragile?

11:02.696 --> 11:03.996
Squirmy.

11:04.563 --> 11:05.698
(growls)

11:05.732 --> 11:08.034
(gasps)
Oh. Oh.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.202
So, Dawnie,

11:10.236 --> 11:12.438
how's everything?

11:12.538 --> 11:13.673
Going good?

11:13.706 --> 11:16.308
Nothing you, um, nothing
you wish was different?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.479
Oh, Hallie,
for Yekk's sake,
take a day off.

11:19.511 --> 11:21.480
We're not here to do vengeance.
We're here to mingle.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.317
HALFREK:
Oh, look! It's Gottrika
what's-her-name.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.886
What has she done
with herself?

11:31.224 --> 11:34.126
-Spike.
-Oh, I want you
to meet my date.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.730
H-Hi. I'm Dawn.

11:37.764 --> 11:38.630
Uh-huh.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.772
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my date.
She's with me.

11:44.804 --> 11:45.773
My date for the wedding.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.440
Yeah.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.376
Okay, well,
nice meeting you.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.447
MAN: Goron!
Hey, hey!

11:55.481 --> 11:58.951
So, circus folk.
What's that like?

11:58.985 --> 12:02.022
Yeah, your friend,
the fellow with the warts,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.390
uh, went off on
his circus heritage,

12:04.423 --> 12:07.394
like you folks are all
in some kind of cult
or something.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.429
-Well, there are
ancient ways.
-Hmm.

12:10.462 --> 12:12.731
Clowning,
as an occupation,

12:12.765 --> 12:16.202
grew out of
the commedia dell'arte and,
uh, ancient sports of course.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.405
Well, the thing is,
if you expect Xander
to bring up his kids

12:19.438 --> 12:24.476
in some kind of foreign speaky,
bow-to-the-Easty kind of cult--

12:24.510 --> 12:27.480
You think the children
should be raised in ignorance
of our ways?

12:27.514 --> 12:31.250
No. No!
The Harrises
are very broad-minded.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.653
-We're Episcopalians.
-CLEM: Oh.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.322
Till death do us part.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.158
(wheezing laugh)
That's what cracks me up.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.328
Hit me again, barkeep.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.605
(sighs)

12:52.639 --> 12:55.674
(sighs)
How do I look?

12:55.707 --> 12:58.311
Well, let's see.
Found your shoes.
Your fly zipped.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.315
I'd say you look like
you're ready to get married.

13:04.551 --> 13:08.620
Oh. You're one
of the decent ones, Xander.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.258
I hope I'm as lucky
as you guys some day.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.027
You want to get lucky?
I still got, what--
15, 20 minutes.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.666
Oh. All right.
Into the breach with you.

13:19.698 --> 13:22.001
Okay, breach me.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.871
Now, let's go over
the list one more time.
Number one.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.975
-Don't let your dad
near the bar.
-Check.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.277
-Number two.
-Don't let your mom
near the bar.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.880
-Check.
-Hey, Buffy. Spike's here,
and he brought a total skank.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.850
Skank. A manic, panic freak
who he was totally macking with

13:36.884 --> 13:38.284
right in the middle
of the room.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.552
-I saw him
shove his tongue--
-Spike brought a date?

13:40.586 --> 13:41.821
Yeah.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.523
Wait till you see her.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.225
Guys, I better go
meet and greet.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.562
Uh, just go ahead.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.730
I'll be a sec.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.443
Hey, Xander.
Congratulations.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.015
Congratulations here, son.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.751
Hello, young man.
(chuckling)

14:12.784 --> 14:14.153
Oh, Xander.
Ooh, I love ya.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.522
Alexander, do you realize that

14:15.554 --> 14:17.657
the usher sat us
in the third row?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.091
Mom, I'm sure
it was a mistake.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.894
-Well, I don't think
it was really--
-Excuse me--

14:20.927 --> 14:23.029
Hey, Neph, do you know where
the photographer is?

14:23.062 --> 14:26.066
-I got a proposition--
-I really need
to talk to you.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.601
-Honey, listen to me.
-Xander, one of Anya's
presents got loose.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.172
-Got loose?
-It's this fully alive
squiggly thingie.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.340
That's fine.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.506
MRS. HARRIS AND DAWN:
(talking simultaneously)

14:34.540 --> 14:36.709
-Please, please.
You have to--
-Hey!

14:36.743 --> 14:40.746
You have to listen to me.
You can't get married today.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.782
It's a huge mistake.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.918
Yeah, right.
Thanks for the advice, Uncle...

14:47.053 --> 14:48.120
Help me here.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.123
Uncle?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.691
You don't recognize
me, do you?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.893
I'm sorry, I don't--

14:53.927 --> 14:57.264
It sounds crazy, I know,
but you have to believe me.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.833
I'm Xander Harris.

15:02.936 --> 15:03.937
I'm you.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.578
What do you mean,
you're me?

15:12.611 --> 15:14.480
I'm you.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.116
I'm you from the future.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.419
Oh, from the future!

15:20.452 --> 15:22.455
For a minute I thought
you were a nut ball,

15:22.554 --> 15:24.323
-but now that
you're from the future--
-Please listen to me.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.594
I found my way back
to warn you, to tell you--

15:27.626 --> 15:29.162
Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.629
-Everything's going to
be all right.
-MR. HARRIS: Toast!

15:30.663 --> 15:33.066
I swear I told that guy
no drinks before the ceremony.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.600
Toast!

15:34.634 --> 15:36.602
A toast to the Harris clan.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.139
Look. Look!

15:39.172 --> 15:41.274
I can prove it to you.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.576
MR. HARRIS:
I can see that blood,
even bad blood...

15:44.610 --> 15:47.346
I thought you might
need convincing.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.316
-MR. HARRIS: Plus, seeing
the messed-up crew Anya has...
-Come on.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.418
-Follow me.
-with her, they make you guys
look pretty good.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.287
And to my wife, Jessica--

15:54.321 --> 15:55.855
Where are you, honey?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.691
-(nervous chuckle)
-There she is.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.595
To my wife.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.331
What would I do
without you, beautiful?

16:07.533 --> 16:11.437
Well, for starters,
I probably wouldn't need
to drink so much,

16:11.471 --> 16:14.006
would I?
(chuckling)

16:14.041 --> 16:17.210
On the brighter side,
marriage has probably
saved me

16:17.244 --> 16:19.678
from a nasty dose
of the clap.

16:19.711 --> 16:22.249
(laughing)
Here's to you.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.884
Does this jerk
ever shut up?

16:24.917 --> 16:27.320
He's startin' to make
my suckers twitch.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.788
MR. HARRIS:
And a toast...

16:28.821 --> 16:33.125
to the bride's dermatologically
challenged family shrub.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.061
Sit down!

16:34.094 --> 16:36.863
Hey, I paid for all this.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.567
You want me to sit down,
you cough up a couple
of grand, Squiddly.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.703
What'd you call me,
you drunken piece of--

16:44.736 --> 16:46.905
-Mazel tov!
-Hey, what's this?

16:46.938 --> 16:50.376
You must be so happy
for Xander on his
very special,

16:50.409 --> 16:53.179
once-in-a-lifetime day,
huh, Mr. Harris?

16:53.212 --> 16:56.149
Nice chassis.
What's under the hood?
(purrs)

16:56.182 --> 16:59.652
You know, I could use
a strong cup of coffee.
Hey, let's get you one too.

16:59.686 --> 17:04.057
-What do you say?
-Did you used to own a little,
square, pinkish purse?

17:04.089 --> 17:07.358
-I did.
-I thought so.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.996
Hey, what do you say
we slip in the back room
and I show you my--

17:10.028 --> 17:14.134
You finish that sentence,
and I guarantee you won't
have anything to show.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.068
Ooh.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.441
(door closes)

17:24.611 --> 17:26.479
-What is it?
-It's magic.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.948
Very powerful.

17:29.981 --> 17:31.084
Look at it.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.252
You'll see what I've seen,

17:33.286 --> 17:36.055
feel what I've felt.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.701
ANNOUNCER:
A snap, fake to the inside.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.238
Anya.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.839
(Announcer continues)

17:59.077 --> 17:59.945
Anya!

17:59.979 --> 18:01.780
Get the hell
away from me!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.549
Dad, Josh is teasing me!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.352
Sara is a weirdo.
Sara is a weirdo.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.354
What?

18:09.689 --> 18:10.856
You going out again?

18:12.525 --> 18:13.759
I'm doing a makeover party.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.128
I thought you hated those.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.164
Well, one of us
has to make some money.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.833
What do you want me
to do, Anya, huh?

18:20.866 --> 18:22.602
I can't work.
My back's shot.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.903
And whose fault is that?

18:24.936 --> 18:27.606
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Buffy thing again.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.608
You had no business
fighting demons with her.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.178
Buffy needed me.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.279
I had to help.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.115
Well, it didn't save her,
did it?

18:38.351 --> 18:39.652
All it did
was ruin our lives.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.987
(bottles clink)

18:41.953 --> 18:43.355
I'll be late.

18:50.061 --> 18:52.531
I hope you crash
in your stupid pink car!

18:56.736 --> 18:58.505
-What?
-SARA: I hate this place.

18:59.971 --> 19:01.208
You guys know
I don't eat wheat.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.509
You don't eat anything, freak.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.044
At least I'm not
a mama's boy.

19:05.076 --> 19:07.046
-At least I'm not
a demonic freak.
-Dad, make him cut it!

19:07.078 --> 19:09.215
Maybe you should talk
to your mother about that.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.853
You've had too much wine.

19:13.885 --> 19:16.222
-(clattering)
-Have I?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.891
I'm just saying
maybe you should talk
to your daughter!

19:18.924 --> 19:20.460
Oh, I hate you guys!

19:20.492 --> 19:22.494
And I know that
you're not my real dad!

19:22.528 --> 19:23.796
And I hate you!
I hate you both!

19:23.829 --> 19:25.998
I wish you'd die!

19:27.400 --> 19:29.669
JOSH:
This sucks.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.871
XANDER:
If you were so unhappy,
why didn't you just leave?

19:31.971 --> 19:34.740
ANYA:
I wanted to.
I should have.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.843
Yeah, you should,
because then maybe then

19:36.875 --> 19:38.377
I would have gotten some touch
in the past 20 years.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.313
I wasn't the one
who stopped touching!

19:40.346 --> 19:44.049
Oh-ho. Maybe,
but you weren't
touching me!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.219
What did you
expect me to do?

19:46.252 --> 19:48.186
You wouldn't come near me
after Buffy--

19:48.221 --> 19:49.989
Don't bring her into this!

19:50.021 --> 19:51.490
Fine. Forget her.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.527
Maybe you were just born
to be a bitter, angry old man.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.329
Shut up.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.665
No! I want my life back!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.534
If I hadn't married you,

20:01.567 --> 20:04.403
I wouldn't have had to hate
myself for the last 30 years!

20:05.738 --> 20:06.772
Shut up!

20:11.577 --> 20:13.045
(panting)

20:13.078 --> 20:14.780
I'm so sorry.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.115
I didn't want to show you.

20:16.147 --> 20:18.550
What happened?
What was that?

20:18.585 --> 20:22.355
A glimpse of your future,
harnessed by magic.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.458
Is she okay? Is she okay?
What did I do?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.759
Listen,
I don't have long here.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.229
The spell
that brought me back,
it won't last.

20:30.262 --> 20:33.400
But you can change things.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.368
It doesn't have to go
like this.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.069
But you can't marry Anya.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.372
But--

20:39.405 --> 20:41.773
You'll hurt her less today
than you will later.

20:41.807 --> 20:42.808
Believe me.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.479
Sometimes two people--

20:46.512 --> 20:50.115
all they bring each other
is pain.

20:50.148 --> 20:52.984
(thunder rumbling)

21:12.471 --> 21:13.772
Hello, Buffy.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.709
Hey.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.378
It's a happy occasion.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.949
Did you meet my friend?

21:22.981 --> 21:26.419
No. Not yet.

21:26.452 --> 21:30.457
But she seems like
a very nice attempt
at making me jealous.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.527
(sighs)
Is it working?

21:37.663 --> 21:38.865
A little.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.867
It doesn't change anything.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.271
But i-- if you're
wildly curious,

21:46.305 --> 21:48.173
yeah, it hurts.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.844
I'm sorry.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.846
Or... good.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.718
You want us to go?

21:58.750 --> 22:01.653
No. No, I--

22:01.688 --> 22:03.522
You have every right
to be here.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.023
I pretty much deserve--

22:05.057 --> 22:06.826
That's not true. You--

22:09.528 --> 22:11.297
God, this is hard.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.132
Yeah.

22:13.164 --> 22:14.266
(sighs)

22:15.201 --> 22:17.369
I think we'll go.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.739
Go where? Your place?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.843
Yeah, I suppose.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.679
That was the idea.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.346
Yeah.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.648
Evil.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.782
Of course.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.853
Uh, but I won't--

22:35.054 --> 22:38.023
Or, uh--
(sighs)

22:38.057 --> 22:39.224
I'll just go.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.662
Give my best to whatever--
the happy couple.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.396
I will.

22:47.098 --> 22:48.800
It's nice to watch you
be happy.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.672
For them, even.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.306
I don't see it a lot.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.276
You, uh--

22:57.308 --> 22:58.810
you glow.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.951
That's because the dress
is radioactive.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.589
-I--I should--
-Yeah.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.925
But it hurts?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.097
Yeah.

23:20.833 --> 23:21.968
Thanks.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.710
You're welcome.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.211
-Let's go, then.
-What about the wedding?

23:33.244 --> 23:34.814
Let's just piss off,
all right?

23:52.932 --> 23:55.634
I'll say this
for the Y chromosome.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.938
Looks good in a tux.

23:58.971 --> 24:02.173
Well, your double X's
don't look too bad
there either.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.978
You're getting married.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.146
Little old Xander.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.682
All growed up.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.118
It's a good thing
I realized I was gay.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.821
Otherwise, hey,
you, me and formal wear.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.165
Do you know
how much I love you?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.502
Hmm. About half as much
as I love you.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.542
You ready
for the long walk?

24:37.910 --> 24:40.346
Uh, yeah,
just give me a sec.

24:40.378 --> 24:43.148
-I want to work on my vows.
-Take your time.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.852
It's not like we can start
the wedding without ya.

24:49.756 --> 24:53.058
I, Anya,
promise to cherish you.

24:53.859 --> 24:56.127
Yeah. No, not "cherish."
Um--

24:56.162 --> 24:59.498
I promise
to have sex with you

24:59.531 --> 25:02.634
whenever I want...

25:02.669 --> 25:06.873
and, uh, uh, pledge
to be your friend,

25:06.905 --> 25:09.508
your wife,
and your confidante

25:09.541 --> 25:11.544
and your sex poodle.

25:11.577 --> 25:12.845
Uh, sex poodle?

25:12.878 --> 25:14.681
Yeah. Why?

25:15.847 --> 25:18.817
Um, I'm not sure you
should say "sex poodle"

25:18.851 --> 25:20.051
in your vows.

25:20.586 --> 25:21.621
Huh.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.857
(chamber music playing)

25:29.929 --> 25:30.762
Music.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.263
They're playing the music!

25:32.298 --> 25:34.400
-This is it.
-(door opens)

25:34.432 --> 25:36.234
Are you ready to go?

25:37.569 --> 25:38.871
He's gone.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.606
Xander disappeared.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.715
What? Xander's gone?

25:49.749 --> 25:52.218
-What should we do?
-I'm gonna go look
for him.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.987
I'm gonna find him,
and you're gonna stall.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.525
(door opens)

25:59.557 --> 26:01.661
(chuckling)
Oh, sorry about that.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.396
There's just gonna be
a little bit of a delay.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.432
Why? What's wrong?

26:07.465 --> 26:08.835
Nothing!

26:09.500 --> 26:10.603
Nothing's wrong.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.404
It's just, um--
It's the minister.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.574
He had, uh, to go

26:15.607 --> 26:18.309
and perform
an emergency C-section.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.545
C-section?

26:19.577 --> 26:21.579
Yeah. You know,
he-- he's--

26:21.614 --> 26:22.914
not-- not just a minister.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.784
He-- he's also
a-- a doctor.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.919
You know,
he's half minister,
half doctor.

26:26.952 --> 26:29.922
He's a, uh, minitor.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.990
Not, of course,
to be confused
with a Minotaur

26:32.023 --> 26:35.161
because he's all,
you know, man-ness--
doctor, minister, man.

26:35.193 --> 26:37.395
No-- No bull parts
whatsoever.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.665
Uh-huh.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.300
So it-- it should just be
a couple of minutes.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.335
Okay.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.409
(sighs, clears throat)

26:50.442 --> 26:51.542
Okay.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.380
For the last time.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.250
I, Anya...

26:59.285 --> 27:01.519
want to marry you,
Xander,

27:01.553 --> 27:04.656
because I love you...

27:04.691 --> 27:07.358
and I'll always love you.

27:07.393 --> 27:12.431
And before I knew you,
I was like a completely
different person.

27:12.463 --> 27:15.101
Not even a person, really.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.104
And I had seen what love
 could do to people,

27:18.136 --> 27:21.640
and it was hurt and sadness.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.843
Alone was better.

27:23.875 --> 27:27.046
And then suddenly
 there was you.

27:28.013 --> 27:30.415
And you knew me.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.352
You saw me.

27:33.384 --> 27:37.155
And it was this... thing.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.590
You make me feel
 safe and warm.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.662
So, I get it now.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.066
I finally get love, Xander.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.201
I really do.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.576
I'm bored.

27:58.609 --> 28:01.446
It's a wedding, honey.
We're all bored.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.751
(string quartet plays)

28:07.353 --> 28:10.256
No! No, it's, uh--

28:10.288 --> 28:12.357
It's-- It's not
what you think.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.792
-Beautiful.
-(quartet stops)

28:17.063 --> 28:18.029
(feedback hums)

28:29.641 --> 28:31.877
(music resumes)

28:34.814 --> 28:36.615
(all muttering)

28:39.786 --> 28:42.054
WOMAN:
This is pandemonium.
What's going on?

28:45.557 --> 28:49.694
I mean, I am sorry,
but what the hell was
that minister thinking?

28:49.728 --> 28:53.799
-I don't know. He--
-I mean, delivering a baby
on my special day?

28:53.833 --> 28:56.434
I mean, it's totally rude
of him, and the mother.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.005
I mean, why couldn't he have
just told her to hold it?

29:02.641 --> 29:04.777
Give me a double Jack.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.746
This is a disaster.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.616
It's that Anya.
I know it.

29:11.650 --> 29:15.153
She made us pay for
the whole thing, and now
she's gonna louse it up!

29:16.122 --> 29:17.323
Women!

29:17.355 --> 29:19.925
I offered to help.
She didn't want my help.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.933
This thing totally
isn't happening.

29:27.967 --> 29:31.670
-We should have known
that she would never, ever--
-I am worried about Anya.

29:31.702 --> 29:34.673
Oh, sure.
Of course you are.

29:34.705 --> 29:36.942
Oh, Halfrek.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.144
You know I love
all my demons equally.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.284
Buffy, you've gotta
do something.

29:49.855 --> 29:53.025
So... who here's
from out of town?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.998
My family is worse.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.666
No way.
Mine is so messed up.
You have no idea.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.369
Just wait until
you see my mom dance
at the reception, okay?

30:04.403 --> 30:06.805
-And then tell me
who's messed up.
-(laughs)

30:06.838 --> 30:08.807
I guess they're all
messed up.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.009
Yeah.
Everybody's pretty lame.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.378
MAN:
First word. One word.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.280
-MAN: Animals.
-WOMAN: Animal?

30:15.314 --> 30:17.282
-(guests shouting)
-MAN: Bull!

30:17.316 --> 30:19.550
Anya! Wait up.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.221
This bride waits
for no one.

30:22.253 --> 30:23.788
If the minister's not here yet,

30:23.821 --> 30:26.557
well, then we'll just have to
get married without a minister.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.259
(cheering, applause)

30:32.898 --> 30:36.301
Geez, what is the holdup?

30:36.335 --> 30:39.337
-Can you keep a secret?
-Mm-hmm.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.909
Nobody knows this,
but the groom, he took off,
and no one can find him.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.045
What?

30:46.077 --> 30:49.347
-Um--
-I'll catch you later, Dawn.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.417
Xander's gone?
Xander's missing?

30:52.451 --> 30:53.885
What do you mean,
Xander's missing?

31:01.093 --> 31:04.195
(chuckling)
It's a joke.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.332
Xander is playing
a joke.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.201
It's like one time
at one of Carol's weddings.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.037
-I had this ape suit...
-Oh, great.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.739
-I put it on--
-Another Harris family joke.

31:13.771 --> 31:16.508
Why don't you have
another drink?

31:16.541 --> 31:20.946
Drinking is the only way
I can dull the pain

31:20.980 --> 31:23.414
of looking at
your ugly face.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.921
You better think real hard
about this, Harris.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.722
Don't touch me
with those nasty
circus things!

31:33.125 --> 31:34.226
That's it!
(grunting)

31:38.297 --> 31:40.632
(blows landing)

31:41.968 --> 31:43.102
(gagging)

31:52.677 --> 31:54.980
-Thanks.
-You're okay?

31:55.013 --> 31:56.248
Yeah.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.451
Xander?
Have you seen Xander?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.820
Has anyone seen Xander?

32:02.854 --> 32:05.257
Well, I saw him go
into the trophy room
with that guy.

32:16.035 --> 32:16.969
You.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.405
You were
talking to Xander
right before he left.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.142
What did he say to you?
What did you say to him?

32:23.174 --> 32:26.278
It really doesn't matter now,
does it? It's done.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.747
What's done?

32:28.779 --> 32:31.416
Did you--
If you said something
to make him leave--

32:31.450 --> 32:32.317
You'll what?

32:33.818 --> 32:35.453
Haven't changed a bit.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.388
Still as vindictive as ever.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.790
Do I know you?

32:40.791 --> 32:42.661
You don't recognize me, Anya?

32:43.862 --> 32:46.897
I'm not the man
I used to be, I know.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.869
Guys!
Would you break it up?

32:53.038 --> 32:54.205
Xander.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.342
Where is he?

32:56.375 --> 32:59.345
You tell me, old man.
You tell me why he left.

32:59.377 --> 33:00.912
He left because of you.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.282
I didn't do anything.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.884
Oh, really?

33:05.916 --> 33:08.019
What about this?

33:21.432 --> 33:22.500
(ferocious yell)

33:22.534 --> 33:23.835
Tell me what you did
with Xander.

33:23.868 --> 33:26.071
What are you?

33:26.105 --> 33:28.874
You did this.
You brought this on.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.576
I've waited a long time
for this, Anyanka.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.080
Who are you?

33:35.114 --> 33:38.183
Remember Chicago,
South Side,

33:38.217 --> 33:39.785
1914?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.088
Stewart Burns,
philanderer.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.656
You'd think you'd remember.
I remembered you.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.593
But then again,
you ruined my life.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.228
You were--

33:50.229 --> 33:51.829
I punished you.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.030
That's right.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.534
Some hussy
I'd been taking around
summons you.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.436
Next thing I know,
I look like this, and I'm being
tortured in another dimension.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.440
-I forgot.
-Well, I didn't!

34:01.472 --> 34:02.574
(roars)

34:03.909 --> 34:04.942
Anya!

34:04.976 --> 34:07.113
Every day I remembered.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.914
And every day, I thought
how I would somehow get here

34:09.947 --> 34:14.219
and ruin your life
like you ruined mine.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.822
It didn't take much either.
I scared off your fiancé with
a couple of phony visions.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.362
Visions of what?

34:23.393 --> 34:27.132
Your future,
or his nightmare vision
of your future.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.902
(sniffles)
That's it? That's all you did?

34:32.938 --> 34:35.273
Yeah. It was easy.

34:36.507 --> 34:37.708
Look at that.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.445
You're crying.
Oh, I like that.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.181
(sniffles)
Stop it.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.784
Oh, cry, Anyanka, cry.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.387
I love to see you cry.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.157
And now, I'd love
to see you scream!

34:52.190 --> 34:53.324
-(yells)
-(screams)

34:54.360 --> 34:55.494
(growling)

34:59.297 --> 35:01.367
-(grunting)
-Come any closer
and I'll kill her!

35:02.833 --> 35:04.503
-Anya!
-Xander!

35:12.478 --> 35:14.012
(blows landing)

35:14.045 --> 35:16.414
I'm so glad you're here.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.184
It was all lies.
What he showed you,
it wasn't true.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.952
He just wanted
to break us up.

35:22.052 --> 35:23.554
(growling)

35:24.655 --> 35:27.092
Doesn't matter now.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.527
It's gonna be okay.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.400
Excuse me.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.038
(growls)

35:40.672 --> 35:41.907
(gagging)

35:45.911 --> 35:46.911
(grunts)

35:50.548 --> 35:51.650
(crack)

35:54.920 --> 35:55.887
It's dead.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.356
Yup.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.259
(applause)

36:07.432 --> 36:09.268
Is anyone else waiting
for it to go "poof"?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.704
Maybe we can cover it
with flowers.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.710
Look at this damage!

36:18.744 --> 36:21.480
I'm not paying for this,
you freaks!

36:21.512 --> 36:24.215
Stop calling us freaks!

36:25.451 --> 36:27.253
Oh, no, no!
No, not again! No!

36:29.755 --> 36:31.021
Stop it!

36:33.291 --> 36:34.793
Everyone, sit down!

36:36.594 --> 36:39.130
This wedding will go on,
so get back in your seats!

36:50.541 --> 36:53.411
You know, it's bad luck
to see me in my dress.

36:55.079 --> 36:57.382
Hey. It's okay.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.684
It's all over now.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.751
He's dead, and it was
just smoke and mirrors.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.322
I know.

37:07.425 --> 37:11.028
So... we're ready now.

37:11.061 --> 37:12.898
-Let's get married.
-I-- I--

37:16.302 --> 37:17.768
I'm not.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.541
I'm not ready.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.175
I can't, An. I'm sorry.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.949
But it-- it wasn't real.

37:30.981 --> 37:33.552
What he showed you,
it wasn't real.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.121
I know it wasn't real,

37:36.153 --> 37:37.422
but it could be.

37:44.028 --> 37:47.097
Well-- What was it?
Was it about me?

37:47.132 --> 37:50.135
'Cause he wanted you
to hate me, Xander.

37:50.168 --> 37:52.338
It wasn't you.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.672
(sighs)
It wasn't you I was hating.

37:57.208 --> 38:00.045
I had these thoughts
and fears before this.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.318
Maybe we just
went too fast.

38:08.554 --> 38:11.422
Look, everybody
has thoughts.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.826
It's natural.
It doesn't mean that
getting married is wrong.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.463
-I know. I know.
-Look, you're just shaken up.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.030
Okay?

38:20.498 --> 38:23.501
You just calm down,
and we'll start over, okay?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.411
We can't start over.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.648
If this is a mistake,
it's forever,

38:37.682 --> 38:39.684
and I don't want
to hurt you.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.253
Not that way.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.925
I'm sorry.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.498
-But--
-I am so sorry.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.867
(sniffles)

39:30.469 --> 39:32.570
(string quartet plays)

40:12.077 --> 40:15.646
Should we do something
for her? Anything?

40:17.782 --> 40:19.617
WILLOW:
She wants to be alone.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.253
That's what she wants.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.724
Oh, God, it just hurts
my heart to think of her.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.293
BUFFY:
I know.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.262
The whole thing
hurts my heart.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.434
I thought they were happy.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.536
BUFFY:
They were.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.440
I know they were.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.842
They were supposed to be
my light at the end
of the tunnel.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.878
I guess they were a train.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.351
Why did this happen?

40:53.384 --> 40:55.487
WILLOW:
I don't know.

40:55.521 --> 40:59.791
I feel like I should
be hating Xander,

40:59.824 --> 41:01.492
but I can't.

41:03.193 --> 41:04.963
I just--
(sighs)

41:05.864 --> 41:07.532
I just hope he's okay.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.137
I wonder where he is.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.677
(siren wailing)

41:19.710 --> 41:22.380
MAN:
Not much to explain.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.248
Air conditioner's busted.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.387
That's it.
Checkout's at 11:00.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.557
(siren wailing)

41:56.847 --> 41:58.416
Are you okay?

42:03.922 --> 42:06.925
I'm tired of crying.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.563
I'm just so tired,
D'Hoffryn.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.333
Oh, Anyanka,

42:16.367 --> 42:17.869
I'm sorry.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.606
But you let him
domesticate you.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.443
When you were
a vengeance demon,
you were powerful.

42:26.476 --> 42:29.715
At the top of your game,
you crushed men like him.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.387
It's time you got back
to what you do best.

42:37.554 --> 42:38.757
Don't you think?

42:51.836 --> 42:53.639
(theme music playing)

43:16.927 --> 43:18.764
Grr! Arrgh!
