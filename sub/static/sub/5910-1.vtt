00:53.640 --> 00:55.915
Our war is going better than ever.www.Titrari.com

00:56.080 --> 01:00.551
But we need heroes! We need you.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.357
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

01:05.760 --> 01:09.355
Service guarantees citizenship.
Would you like to know more?

01:10.200 --> 01:13.510
The sky marshal launches
Operation March to Victory.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.433
A bold, new strategy
calling for total war...

01:16.600 --> 01:20.229
...against the Bug, on every front.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.000
Would you like to know more?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.350
Look out! Look out!

01:46.800 --> 01:49.473
Fall back!

01:49.640 --> 01:52.996
Retreat! Retreat!

01:53.160 --> 01:54.878
- We need pickup now!
- Yes, sir!

01:55.040 --> 01:59.318
Sir, this is Mobile Infantry Bravo 6
to Fleet Rescue.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.711
It's Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.394
Fall back!

02:20.400 --> 02:21.958
Retreat!

02:24.400 --> 02:26.277
Horton, Sandee, pull back!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.550
Help me with this, goddamn it!

02:30.280 --> 02:32.748
You're okay, Sandee. I got you.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.479
- You're okay!
- Hold what you've got!

02:39.320 --> 02:41.515
- Come on, Bug!
- Tor!

02:41.680 --> 02:43.557
Cover our 6!

02:43.720 --> 02:46.029
Oh, that 6.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.918
Hey, Bug!

02:49.680 --> 02:52.194
Do you copy? Do you copy?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.277
Brick! Cover Tor!

02:54.440 --> 02:57.352
- Tor.
- Come and get some from Tor, baby!

03:06.480 --> 03:08.311
Otter!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.789
Fight or die, soldier!

03:11.680 --> 03:13.477
- Private Sahara!
- Yes, sergeant?

03:13.640 --> 03:16.712
Private Otter is a dead man.
If he won't fight, shoot him!

03:16.880 --> 03:18.711
Sir!

03:18.880 --> 03:22.759
Just pull the trigger, Billie!
It's not enough, but it'll have to do.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.679
- Fleet Rescue to Brav o 6.
- Go ahead, Fleet Rescue.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.276
Fleet Rescue to Brav o 6,
rescue priority is no-go, MI.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.194
Colt-Victor-one-niner is negative
for pickup!

03:33.360 --> 03:36.670
Hold the perimeter!
Hold that line!

03:36.840 --> 03:38.751
- Hold the line!
- I don't want excuses!

03:38.920 --> 03:40.512
I want a crossfire!

03:40.680 --> 03:43.240
Get in and plug that hole.
Plug that hole!

03:43.400 --> 03:46.517
- General, Fleet's no-go for pickup.
- We gotta make a move.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.989
- Hold the line!
- Bugs have got Coy!

03:49.160 --> 03:52.869
This is General Shepherd.
You jackass! We need pickup!

03:55.320 --> 03:58.676
Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue,
do you copy?

03:58.880 --> 04:02.236
General, getting a vision.
It isn't clear.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.113
They're building up.
They're all around us.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.915
Lieutenant, you're the psychic!
Tell me something I don't know!

04:09.120 --> 04:11.759
It's something massive.
It'll take us all out.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.390
- I can't get it all, but...
- General! There's an outpost.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.313
Hotel Delta 185,
abandoned eight days ago!

04:18.480 --> 04:19.959
Half a klick that way.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.675
- Middle of Satan's Anvil?
- Bugs own that real estate, general.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.472
There's no cover on the Anvil.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.830
We're gonna have a rough ride,
lieutenant!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.274
Yes, sir.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.556
You, you, you, and you, stay here.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.472
Everybody else move out!

04:33.880 --> 04:36.269
Request permission to remain
with the general.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.953
- That's negative, Rake.
- Sir?

04:38.120 --> 04:40.714
- Lieutenant Dill will assume command.
- Yes, sir!

04:40.880 --> 04:43.599
He's the psychic.
You're the war fighter!

04:43.880 --> 04:46.440
Move them out, sergeant!
Give them hell!

04:46.640 --> 04:49.712
Yes, sir!
Prepare to withdraw.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.711
Withdraw!

04:51.920 --> 04:55.310
- Let's go, move it, move it, move it!
- Come on, Billie.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.516
Keep going!

04:57.840 --> 05:00.149
Let's go!

05:02.520 --> 05:04.476
Follow me!

05:12.120 --> 05:14.634
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

05:21.960 --> 05:24.679
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Come on!

05:27.360 --> 05:29.157
Let's go!

05:29.320 --> 05:31.276
Let's go!

05:31.440 --> 05:32.714
Move it!

05:32.880 --> 05:34.916
Move it, move it, move it!

05:56.040 --> 05:59.953
Where's my frigging outpost, corporal?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.669
It's here. We're here...

06:18.760 --> 06:21.149
About time, corporal.
That soup's gonna boil!

06:21.320 --> 06:24.198
- Move out!
- Let's go! Come on, come on!

06:24.360 --> 06:26.555
- Let's go! Come on, suck it up!
- Hurry up!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.598
Move, move, move!

06:30.320 --> 06:34.074
- Take cover!
- Let's get out of here!

06:37.680 --> 06:40.194
Move it, Otter!
Come on, move it.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.994
Come on! Hurry up.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.832
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.150
Come on.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.039
- Get down!
- Over there!

07:03.200 --> 07:04.997
- Hurry up.
- Grab that door.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.513
Bill, help me, help me...

07:17.120 --> 07:19.509
Come on, Billie, come on!

07:19.720 --> 07:20.994
Take my hand!

07:21.160 --> 07:22.878
Come on! Stay down.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.354
No!

07:27.480 --> 07:29.675
- Come on!
- It's okay. I got you.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.950
Otter, Kobe, get down!

07:41.280 --> 07:43.794
Keep going.
Come on.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.594
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Come on.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.678
- Go.
- Kobe, look out!

08:00.160 --> 08:01.798
Tor! Brick!

08:01.960 --> 08:04.235
With me! Move!

08:09.680 --> 08:12.399
Tor, Horton! Get Kobe inside!

08:12.560 --> 08:15.597
- Brick, with me. Go!
- Come on!

08:15.760 --> 08:18.149
Stay with me, buddy!

08:18.320 --> 08:21.278
Sandee! Move on!

08:24.200 --> 08:27.590
Here we go.
You're all right, you're all right.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.478
Brick! You and Sandee...

08:52.640 --> 08:56.189
...take a squad, set a perimeter.
Sahara? Get that door closed.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.554
Sir!

08:57.720 --> 08:59.870
Make a hole!

09:00.440 --> 09:04.069
- Make it wide!
- Sahara! Out of the way!

09:04.640 --> 09:08.155
- Coming through.
- Get out of the way!

09:08.320 --> 09:09.992
Right, easy. Take it easy.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.991
Watch his back.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.877
Get his pack off!
Horton, cut that radio off!

09:18.040 --> 09:19.837
Get that off him.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.639
Take it easy.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.951
You're all right.
Where are those meds?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.552
Where are those meds?
Damn it!

10:06.680 --> 10:08.716
- Sergeant?
- It's fine.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.792
- Sergeant!
- Just take it easy. Take it easy.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.793
I want someone on that com,
and I want pickup.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.110
Yes, sir, wouldn't we all?

10:17.840 --> 10:21.355
- That's a direct order, sergeant.
- No-go on the door, sarge.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.949
Stay down. Relax, buddy.
You gotta relax.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.714
Why can't you do anything
for this man, Tor?

10:30.640 --> 10:31.914
Private!

10:32.080 --> 10:34.878
Get on that com.
I want pickup now!

10:35.720 --> 10:39.474
- What are you looking at, private?
- Sir, com don't run without power.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.599
Well, at OCS, you learn that a sergeant
is the solution to any problem.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.478
So you get the power up.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.632
They say what kind of boat
Fleet lands in a shit-storm?

10:48.800 --> 10:51.473
I am giving the orders!
You will take them!

10:51.640 --> 10:55.110
I want the goddamn power!
And I want it now!

11:25.640 --> 11:27.631
I am waiting, sergeant.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.189
Horton, Otter, Sahara, with me.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.236
Shit. Sir?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.717
Might want to see this.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.800
Radio's nonoperational.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.916
Coming, lieutenant?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.957
Looks like Colonel Hohlback
left in a hurry.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.036
What the hell is that?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.351
I'd say we've got company.

13:30.520 --> 13:34.149
Horton! You and Otter locate
the reactors and fire them up.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.754
What is that?

13:49.480 --> 13:51.550
Outpost incinerator.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.871
Move away from the door!

14:06.360 --> 14:07.952
Why are you still here, soldier?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.553
Probably because no
one lit the furnace.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.472
Captain V.J. Dax.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.631
Says here he's a big hero.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.351
Combat medals, Bronze Stars, Purple
Heart, Purple Heart, Purple Heart.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.636
Federal Medal of Valour
at Widowmakers.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.028
That's a lot of crap.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.476
Wounded four times, refused numerous
battlefield commissions...

14:37.640 --> 14:39.517
Give me that.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.197
- Some hero.
- You murdered Colonel Hohlback?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.430
He had his Morita and a sidearm.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.749
I just used my hands.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.876
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.793
He's a mad dog.
He stays in the cage.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.635
Just remember, lieutenant,
every dog has its day!

15:48.800 --> 15:51.268
Sarge! Hostiles!

15:51.440 --> 15:53.396
I am in command here, private.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.356
Now, how many and
what's our situation?

15:57.520 --> 16:00.512
- Looks like a whole damn circus.
- Let's go.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.079
Trooper!

16:31.760 --> 16:34.513
Shelter!
Right perimeter, spread wide!

16:34.680 --> 16:37.433
You three, follow me.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.512
- He's spreading us too thin!
- You know something I don't, trooper?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.438
They're shifting their lines!

17:00.160 --> 17:03.470
You, take the left!
Take the middle! Take the right!

17:09.400 --> 17:11.960
Sandee! Report!

17:12.119 --> 17:14.156
Nothing! No movement!

17:15.000 --> 17:17.513
Come on, you bastards!
What are you waiting for?

17:17.680 --> 17:18.907
Shut up, fathead!

17:19.079 --> 17:22.231
- You starting with me?
- Just like covering your 6, huh?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.836
Prepare to fire!

17:43.640 --> 17:45.358
Otter, get up!

17:48.760 --> 17:51.274
Fire! Fire! Fire!

17:59.720 --> 18:03.349
Come on! Bug!

18:35.640 --> 18:37.471
Son of a bitch!

18:37.640 --> 18:39.631
Pull back!

18:39.800 --> 18:41.950
Come on, go, go!
I got you covered!

18:42.120 --> 18:45.271
Billie. It's okay. It's okay!

18:48.680 --> 18:50.750
Go, go, go, go!

18:59.640 --> 19:01.870
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.439
Give me your hand.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.239
- What?
- Give me your hand.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.593
Look out!

19:24.360 --> 19:28.239
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Don't let go!

19:28.920 --> 19:30.876
No!

19:34.600 --> 19:36.955
Pull back your line, lieutenant!

19:57.520 --> 19:59.351
Weapon!

20:09.120 --> 20:10.838
Let's go.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.112
Bug!

20:29.960 --> 20:32.633
Get down!
Move!

20:39.080 --> 20:42.038
- All right, people, listen up!
- Who the hell let you out?

20:42.200 --> 20:45.988
- In about 15 seconds...
- All right, you son of a bitch...

20:49.720 --> 20:51.756
Shield your eyes at count zero!

20:51.920 --> 20:53.273
Pass the word!

20:53.440 --> 20:56.079
Get off your ass,
there's a war going on.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.470
You two! With me on flank!

21:01.880 --> 21:04.553
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.717
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.679
Look out!

21:15.720 --> 21:16.994
Come on!

21:24.680 --> 21:26.511
Three.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.750
Two.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.990
One.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.718
Zero.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.000
Perimeter burn.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.953
I need two volunteers.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.635
- Who do you think you are?
- The big stick that's running this show.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.352
- I'll go.
- Me too.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.593
If we're not back inside of five minutes,
it means more Bugs are on the way.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.069
You mean we didn't kill them all?

22:41.240 --> 22:43.356
You never kill them all, son.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.995
All right, who's got...?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.359
A light.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.232
Otter, take a knee.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.317
- You see those busted wires there?
- Yes, sir.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.199
You got the wiggle room, kid.
Splice them together.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.237
Trooper, hand me that...

23:35.040 --> 23:36.996
Where's your knife?

23:37.160 --> 23:39.196
I must have lost it, sir.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.877
Anyone who loses his knife in my unit
would be strung up for lashes, kid.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.030
You want to be careful
with the red wire.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.478
We got movement!

24:04.640 --> 24:06.835
Horton, illumination round.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.352
Hold your fire, we're coming through!

24:15.760 --> 24:17.159
It's the general.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.276
I see him!
He's bringing home two.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.599
He's bringing home three.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.513
Wonder who didn't make it.
Hope it wasn't Goldy.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.389
He was nice to me on my first day.
It's those little things that count.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.676
Yeah, like doing your goddamn job.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.434
Hostiles! Right on your general's ass!

24:34.600 --> 24:36.477
Come on, kid!

25:22.200 --> 25:23.838
Outstanding.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.231
- That stinks!
- You get so you like it after a while.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.710
- Son, I'll never forget it.
- Me neither, sir.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.999
What kind of a-hole do you think I am?
Put her there!

25:35.160 --> 25:36.752
Welcome back, sir.

25:36.920 --> 25:39.912
I don't know who you are,
but you're aces with me.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.555
It's nothing personal, general.
I'm just doing my job.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.792
Hey, fellas, let me give you a hand.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.038
Hell, I got a dog back home
weighs more than she does.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.595
Well, look what the cat drug in!

26:08.160 --> 26:11.755
You should see that damn cat!
We're in the shitter, huh?

26:11.920 --> 26:13.990
- We got a chance.
- Good to see you.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.151
Want the bad news or the bad news?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.230
- I almost forgot your knife.
- Keep it, kid.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.790
- No, I couldn't.
- Trooper needs a knife.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.030
Officers just tell troopers
where to die.

26:25.440 --> 26:29.592
- That's not really true, is it, sir?
- Watch out for officers, son.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.557
It's their job to get you killed.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.630
First wave came in,
and Deke and Slater were killed.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.512
Came in again and that...
That kid Goldy was gone.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.438
And then it was just...

26:52.120 --> 26:54.634
...me and O'Hara.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.997
That magnificent son of a bitch.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.075
We held them.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.438
I tell you, this...

27:06.160 --> 27:10.915
...star don't mean a hill of beans when
you're caught between shit and sweat.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.356
And then these two beautiful
bastards show up.

27:14.520 --> 27:18.832
These two here, and they're carrying
a couple of grenades...

27:19.000 --> 27:21.594
...and they got a boatload of gumption.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.671
And they saved my sorry ass!

27:24.080 --> 27:26.230
And I'd like to introduce you to them.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.278
This is Corporal Joe Griff,
Medical Corps.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.000
And this is Technical
Sergeant Ari Peck.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.596
And I can't tell you a thing about
Sleeping Beauty over here...

27:35.760 --> 27:39.799
...because she snored through
the whole damn thing.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.757
That's Private Soda, sir.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.480
She didn't sleep after our
unit got chopped down.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.428
Found Peck the next day,
what, about five days ago?

27:48.600 --> 27:52.639
Everybody's gotta sleep sometime.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.038
What's your story, Peck?

27:55.200 --> 28:00.433
32nd Tech Brigade,
sole survivor, sir!

28:00.600 --> 28:01.919
That's me.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.032
Been out there about a month,
near as I can tell.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.759
That's a long time.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.957
Pretty long, yeah. I guess.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.157
Well, then, we got to get you home.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.872
Lieutenant Dill.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.793
- Yes, sir!
- Has pickup been arranged?

28:32.080 --> 28:35.470
- Sergeant Peck, can I talk to you?
- Yes, sir?

28:35.640 --> 28:39.553
You think you can make this com talk
and squawk like it ought to?

28:39.720 --> 28:46.114
Well, you can bet I'll die trying, sir.

28:46.880 --> 28:52.318
- Get some sleep and try later.
- Oh, no, no. I'll get on this right now.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.118
That's outstanding, sergeant!

28:54.280 --> 28:57.158
You're a credit to your
Mobile Infantry unit. Thank you.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.515
When is the last time
you took a shower?

28:59.680 --> 29:03.434
Let's worry about the sniff factor
after we get our asses unslung.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.158
Yes, sir.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.910
We could sit pretty tight if we could
shut this door, sergeant.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.718
I'll get someone on it.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.678
At least there's one man looking
in the right direction.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.114
Yes, sir.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.957
What's wrong with her, corporal?

29:39.120 --> 29:42.749
It's the wind, sir.
Dries out the membranes.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.829
- She'll be fine when she wakes up.
- She's got the right idea.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.552
Good night, troopers.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.597
Get some sleep, all of you!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.478
That's an order.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.790
- And, Dill...
- Yes, sir.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.198
I want a full report of today's
action when I wake up...

29:59.360 --> 30:02.113
...explaining how you got five
of my troopers killed.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.838
Yes, sir.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.791
You heard the man.
Hit the sack!

30:16.840 --> 30:18.114
Not you, trooper.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.554
Yes, sir?

30:19.720 --> 30:23.269
Letting that criminal loose is a
court-martial offence, private.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.873
I thought he could help us.

30:25.040 --> 30:29.158
You thought the judgment of a murderer
was preferable to an officer's?

30:29.320 --> 30:33.154
Well, that'll make for a hell
of a compelling defence.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.311
I wasn't thinking, sir.
It was intuition.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.438
Intuition?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.953
I had no idea you were psychic.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.554
I scored high when I was a kid, sir.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.948
Really?

30:54.160 --> 30:56.355
Why aren't you wearing the black?

30:56.520 --> 30:58.750
I became inconsistent, sir.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.516
Onset of puberty?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.751
It happens to you women.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.878
- When is it gonna happen to you?
- Excuse me?

31:09.040 --> 31:13.716
Puberty. I hear it's a necessary step
on the way to becoming a man.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.553
You're addressing an
officer of the Federation.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.439
Shove that officer crap
up your Buster Brown.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.750
An officer who behaves
as you did today...

31:21.920 --> 31:24.798
...and takes it out
on a trooper ain't a man!

31:24.960 --> 31:28.475
I'm not a man? What kind of a man
turns his back on the Federation?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.039
I'm glad you asked.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.875
I trained a generation of people to
throw themselves into the grinder.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.600
The Federation chewed them up
and spit them out.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.548
So now when they say, " Push on
to glory," I say, "What glory?"

31:40.720 --> 31:44.679
What would you know about glory?
You call yourself a hero?

31:44.840 --> 31:50.119
No, son. That's something other people
call you, and it's really just a trick.

31:50.280 --> 31:54.558
When you throw your life away, instead
of fool, they call you hero.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.635
And as for glory, ask her. She'll
tell you everything you need to know!

32:00.960 --> 32:02.188
How dare you?

32:03.280 --> 32:04.838
Just one man's opinion.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.594
No, it's not. It's treason!

32:10.160 --> 32:12.390
Then maybe you ought to shoot me.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.437
Now, there's something
we agree on.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.910
Well, go ahead. Take out that
popgun and have at it, soldier.

32:18.080 --> 32:24.110
I believe in the rules and regulations
that the Federation stands for.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.157
Very good, lieutenant!

32:26.320 --> 32:28.197
But you left out the kids.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.237
- What?
- Cowards.

32:31.360 --> 32:35.433
They always hide behind
rules and children.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.436
I'll see you hang!

32:47.600 --> 32:50.717
Just so long as it's regulation rope.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.999
Oh, let's see.

33:01.440 --> 33:07.675
Got your mystery meat sticks,
egg caps, hardtack, beans.

33:07.840 --> 33:11.628
Insta-veggie meal,
Choco-pudding Delite.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.236
Sweet tooth, huh?

33:37.640 --> 33:40.438
Taps in 15 minutes.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.831
I'll get you!

34:19.880 --> 34:22.518
Nice to have you with us, trooper.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.437
You've been out for a long time.
How you feeling?

34:31.800 --> 34:33.597
I feel good, sir.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.152
You fit for duty?

34:35.880 --> 34:37.677
Raring to go.

34:39.679 --> 34:43.275
Well, that's outstanding.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.599
What's the ETA on a door
we can shut, gentlemen?

35:21.760 --> 35:25.594
Well, sir, I think that should do it.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.228
If you'll hold on...

35:38.080 --> 35:41.470
- Watch out for the cables!
- The cables. Stop it! Stop it!

35:41.640 --> 35:43.471
Do it, do it, do it.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.555
Shit.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.156
Great, you welded
the damn thing open.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.548
You idiots.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.914
All personnel to the perimeter.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.479
Troopers, you heard the man.
Let's go!

36:05.640 --> 36:08.234
Get moving!
Take that weapon. Come on.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.631
Sandee, Horton, Soda, Brick,
come on, you lazy bastards.

36:11.800 --> 36:15.110
Let's move it.
Move, move, move, move!

36:16.800 --> 36:18.199
Sahara.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.751
You two over there, you two
front and running. Where's my OP?

36:23.920 --> 36:28.471
Man your post! Go, go, go!

36:34.280 --> 36:37.989
- What's wrong?
- General, there's something...

36:38.160 --> 36:39.388
Move!

36:41.360 --> 36:44.318
Scouting parties, sir, 100 metres out.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.436
When they figure
that fence is down...

36:46.600 --> 36:50.309
...they're gonna show up like relatives
to a rich man's funeral.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.509
- Let there be light.
- Yeah.

36:57.720 --> 37:02.111
- Yeah!
- Here we go. We got power.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.153
That's what I'm talking about.
I can see you now.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.880
Hey, general?

37:08.040 --> 37:12.192
- Peck, is this your doing?
- It's a little wonky...

37:12.360 --> 37:15.113
...but it'll hold. I hope.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.350
You have our tremendous
gratitude, Peck.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.035
Oh, it was nothing, sir.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.751
I'll get back to work on the com now.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.990
- Attaboy, Peck.
- Way to go, Peck.

37:27.160 --> 37:31.790
Peck. Peck. Peck.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.951
All right.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.115
Dax, the charges
against you are serious...

37:39.280 --> 37:42.158
...but I can't afford to lose a man
of your experience.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.477
Give me your word
as an officer you'll do your duty.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.759
I'm no longer an officer, general,
but I'll give you my word as a man.

37:49.920 --> 37:53.151
Your rank is restored
until your guilt or innocence...

37:53.320 --> 37:55.117
...is determined by a hearing.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.318
Well, I can assure you
I killed Colonel Hohlback.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.877
Then I guarantee you'll hang, but until
then, I expect you to do your duty.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.634
- Yes, sir.
- I want forward OP.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.916
Three watches a day.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.277
Fences fail, troopers get lazy.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.398
- You carry on, captain.
- Yes, sir.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.753
Something I can do for you?

38:53.960 --> 38:57.953
I just came to say thanks
for saving my ass.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.196
That's the job.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.517
How come you don't sleep inside
like everyone else?

39:04.720 --> 39:07.553
I figure this is where
the enemy will show up.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.350
No telling what kind of fun
you could get in out here, huh?

39:15.800 --> 39:19.998
- Are you flirting with me, soldier?
- No, sir, I don't flirt.

39:20.200 --> 39:24.273
- Never?
- Never ever, sir.

39:25.040 --> 39:29.192
- Well, you're the real deal.
- The genuine article.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.560
And you want some action.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.916
You'll get all the action you want
after the Bugs show up.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.991
You know...

39:45.600 --> 39:48.910
...it's all the waiting that gets me.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.155
Oh, I see.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.717
You need something
to occupy your mind.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.072
Come here.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.754
That's good right there.
Drop and give me 100.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.239
- Sir?
- You got a lot of energy, trooper.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.836
Now get down and start counting.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.150
Yes, sir.

40:30.480 --> 40:35.076
One, two, three, four...

40:36.040 --> 40:39.715
...five, six, seven...

40:39.920 --> 40:41.399
Make it 200.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.069
You lose something?

41:15.520 --> 41:18.273
Yo, you're the new guy, so l...

41:19.240 --> 41:20.719
Can we play too?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.396
I got mess duty.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.552
- Thanks for the wake up, Soda.
- Pleasure.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.277
You sure you know
what you're doing?

41:30.440 --> 41:33.989
Oh, I got a pretty good idea, but...

41:34.200 --> 41:36.589
...you know,
practice does make perfect.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.354
Nice.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.511
Come on, Billie.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.550
No, no, forget it, Sandee. He's a jerk.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.110
Hey, Sandee...

42:25.960 --> 42:29.350
- What's with her?
- Horton's with the new girl.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.953
- Sipping some Soda.
- Ain't war hell?

42:46.600 --> 42:49.160
Who goes there?

42:49.320 --> 42:51.356
Horton?

42:54.080 --> 42:56.230
Oh, it's you.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.996
Sorry.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.798
You okay?

43:04.960 --> 43:07.155
No.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.597
- Anything I can do?
- No.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.319
At least let me take a look
at that cut on your chin.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.080
This? It's just a scratch.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.636
General wants everybody tiptop.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.190
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

43:27.360 --> 43:30.193
How long have you been out here?

43:31.520 --> 43:34.592
- All my life, it seems like.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

43:34.760 --> 43:38.435
I've been here for eight months,
and I've only seen the sun twice.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.117
Might be a little easier
if you took your helmet off, Jill.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.112
God, what happened to your fingers?

43:51.280 --> 43:54.955
- You know, muzzle burn.
- That looks really bad.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.715
Hey, who's the medic here
anyway, huh?

44:01.120 --> 44:03.270
Hey, Joe.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.793
Yeah?

44:04.960 --> 44:07.679
Has anybody ever told you
what a nice smile you have?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.431
Yeah.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.798
Probably.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.276
Feeling better?

44:19.080 --> 44:20.911
No.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.952
Do you want to?

44:54.400 --> 44:57.358
- What happened to her, corporal?
- Just a nosebleed, sir.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.431
She's gonna be fine.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.910
- How do you feel?
- You know how I feel.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.236
What gives?

45:08.400 --> 45:10.994
It looks like we got
a couple new couples.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.948
No wonder we're losing this war.
Everyone's fucking instead of fighting.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.955
What are you looking at?

45:19.120 --> 45:22.317
- Get back to work.
- I'll get to work.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.433
- Good morning, captain.
- What makes you think so?

45:31.600 --> 45:33.670
Why, are we in for it?

45:33.840 --> 45:38.231
- Sooner or later.
- You got time for breakfast?

45:39.640 --> 45:43.713
You're welcome to join me, as long as
you don't expect cheerful conversation.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.075
Not a morning person, huh?

45:46.240 --> 45:49.232
No, I'm a miserable, murdering bastard.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.960
- And that's on a good day.
- What's a bad day like?

45:52.120 --> 45:55.078
Any one day in particular
you're interested in?

45:55.240 --> 45:56.878
No.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.315
That second lieu-y
send you to question me?

46:03.480 --> 46:06.711
- Lieutenant Dill? He thinks I'm an idiot.
- Are you?

46:06.880 --> 46:11.271
- Me? Yeah. Definitely.
- Trust me, I got you beat.

46:11.480 --> 46:16.429
Well, I fell in love, and I got busted
down from corporal for fraternisation.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.593
- So who wants to be a corporal?
- Here's the idiot part.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.432
He got killed.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.748
You really some kind of psychic?

46:29.320 --> 46:33.233
Yeah. Maybe. I guess.
Not like Dill, not Psi Corps.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.589
Well, your fella...

46:38.320 --> 46:40.390
...did you know he was gonna
buy the farm?

46:40.560 --> 46:42.949
It doesn't work that way.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.712
Well, that's good, I guess.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.111
Maybe that's why I don't
believe in all that bunk.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.233
Those tags belong
to the troopers that you lost...

46:53.440 --> 46:57.035
...and you wear them because you feel
responsible for what happened.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.515
That's a lucky guess.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.990
- Why'd you kill your CO?
- You tell me.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.435
I'm not that good.

47:07.160 --> 47:09.628
He gave some stupid orders
that got kids killed.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.831
One day too many,
or too many one day.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.356
- Maybe I'm the wheel that broke.
- You ought to forgive yourself.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.511
It's war.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.274
Don't spend too much time
around me, trooper.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.512
I'd hate to end up wearing your tags.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.994
Stupid Bug.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.639
You're relieved.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.791
Thanks.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.594
Hey... Hey, trooper?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.877
Who's that?

48:33.040 --> 48:35.156
Peck.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.229
Hey, sarge, what do you need?

48:40.400 --> 48:43.756
Well, I could use a hand.

48:43.960 --> 48:48.112
Buddy, anything I can do
for you is aces by me.

48:48.320 --> 48:54.350
You think you could
lie down on the fl...?

48:54.520 --> 48:59.196
- The floor?
- Floor. And reach behind the cons...

48:59.360 --> 49:03.672
I got it, I got it. You want me to lay on
the floor and reach behind the console.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.792
Okay.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.911
Here we go.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.516
Son of a...

49:18.120 --> 49:20.111
How's this?

49:22.400 --> 49:24.675
Oh, God!

49:24.880 --> 49:26.552
Help!

49:27.640 --> 49:30.552
Gotta keep quiet.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.554
Help! Help!

50:23.360 --> 50:24.679
We got com.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.996
We got com.

50:29.480 --> 50:33.917
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.310
Come in, Fleet Rescue.

50:38.720 --> 50:42.076
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.710
- This is...
- How's that report coming?

50:45.920 --> 50:50.994
Well, I'm not so much writing a report
as building your gallows, Dax.

50:51.160 --> 50:54.835
- I didn't take you for a carpenter.
- Shift to Command frequency.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.037
There was this other carpenter
a few thousand years ago...

50:58.200 --> 51:00.555
...a better man than you or me.

51:00.720 --> 51:03.871
Well, that carpentry business
was the death of him.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.078
Be careful of what you build
and what crosses you bear.

51:07.240 --> 51:10.994
- Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Command.
- Lieutenant.

51:12.400 --> 51:16.279
Roger, Hotel Delta,
this is Fleet Command. Over.

51:16.440 --> 51:21.070
This is the 701 st Mobile Infantry,
Bravo Company, requesting pickup.

51:21.280 --> 51:24.511
Tak e a number, MI.
We got stragglers all over the planet.

51:25.720 --> 51:29.076
- What's your name, sailor?
- Fleet Lieutenant Mary Klinghof.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.829
- Getting smart won't help you, jarhead.
- You listen up, fruit fly.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.195
This is General Jack Gordon Shepherd.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.397
And if somebody doesn't make
this pickup their priority...

51:38.560 --> 51:41.074
...I'm gonna make it
my priority to come down...

51:41.240 --> 51:43.800
...and chew out some Fleet-ass,
starting with you.

51:44.120 --> 51:47.032
Sorry, sir, I didn't know
who I was talking to.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.470
- That's because you're a moron.
- Yeah.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.313
Yes, sir, but we got
a lot of wounded out there.

51:52.480 --> 51:56.189
The wounded come first. Any excuses
after that come out of your butt.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.476
Shepherd, out.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.070
Where's Peck?
I'm gonna give him a medal.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.152
- Asleep, sir. Dead on his feet.
- Well, he's earned it.

52:05.320 --> 52:09.916
- Any day on that door, Brick.
- We're all waiting for something, sarge.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.269
- But it ain't the door.
- Outstanding.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.356
Not you, trooper.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.835
- Lucky guess.
- We're all gonna die.

52:54.040 --> 52:58.192
- What would you know about glory?
- It doesn't work that way.

53:00.080 --> 53:03.038
- Lf he won't fight, shoot him!
- No!

53:04.000 --> 53:06.912
- Sahara.
- I haven't seen him.

53:07.080 --> 53:09.150
- Wak e up.
- The wheel that brok e.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.671
Wak e up.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.195
Wak e up.

53:39.480 --> 53:43.393
Give me a little more.
Don't be shy. Come on.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.597
Yeah. Oh, trouble at the trough.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.876
It's gonna get ugly.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.476
- What's eating Tor, huh?
- Not you.

54:00.680 --> 54:05.595
Yeah, I guess you're right.
War does some weird things to people.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.438
Everything okay?

54:36.800 --> 54:39.837
No, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

54:57.360 --> 55:02.195
- You look a little shaky, trooper.
- Yeah, something's not right.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.318
That's what they call it
when you're behind enemy lines.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.311
It feels worse than that.

55:07.480 --> 55:10.313
Oh, is this another one
of your psychic hot flashes?

55:10.480 --> 55:12.357
It seems like Tor has changed.

55:12.520 --> 55:15.193
Because he wouldn't take
Brick's bait? About time.

55:15.360 --> 55:18.830
- It seems sudden, sarge.
- Like you puking your guts out?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.514
I guess I'm coming down
with something.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.399
- I wonder what that could be?
- There's a big knot...

55:24.560 --> 55:26.152
...where my stomach used to be.

55:26.320 --> 55:30.029
Sarge, I barely touched the medic's
hand just now, and I saw something.

55:30.200 --> 55:33.033
- You saw something?
- Something terrible.

55:33.560 --> 55:37.439
- Maybe you're just going crazy.
- I love you too, sarge.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.796
Girls get wacky
when they're pregnant.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.231
Suddenly, they know everything
about everything.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.119
Oh, Jesus.

55:48.800 --> 55:52.156
Yeah, you're about as psychic
as a doorknob, trooper.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.517
You ready?

56:26.680 --> 56:31.549
I'm kind of tired.

56:33.880 --> 56:37.555
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, thanks.

56:37.720 --> 56:40.075
Oh, my shoe.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.390
Don't worry about it.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.668
- Are you scared to shower, Otter?
- What does it matter?

56:50.880 --> 56:53.553
We're going home
in a few hours anyway.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.553
Hi, guys.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.438
Holy God, what the...?

57:43.720 --> 57:46.154
Oh, God. Oh, God.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.589
Open the door! Open the door!
We're gonna die in here!

58:00.760 --> 58:02.910
Open the door!

58:31.560 --> 58:35.917
Captain, I need to talk to you,
but it's gonna sound crazy.

58:36.120 --> 58:38.315
- Well, spit it out, trooper.
- Look, sir...

58:38.480 --> 58:41.153
...I know I'm not really
supposed to be psychic...

58:41.320 --> 58:43.276
...but I have this terrible feeling.

58:48.880 --> 58:51.713
- Yes, sir.
- As you were.

58:51.880 --> 58:56.954
We have a situation here that requires
the attention of Military Intelligence.

58:57.480 --> 58:59.948
- Tell him.
- This morning, in the mess...

59:00.120 --> 59:03.635
...I accidentally touched Griff's hand.
I might've had a vision.

59:04.200 --> 59:06.236
Playing psychic again, private?

59:06.400 --> 59:08.834
Could you keep
an open mind here, lieutenant?

59:09.000 --> 59:11.309
This trooper's
got information that's vital.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.956
Some of the troopers have been
acting a little strange lately.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.872
Describe what you saw.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.395
He wasn't a man.
He was some other thing.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.120
Maybe 1000 things.
Somehow he was connected...

59:27.280 --> 59:32.070
...to Tor and Sandee and Horton
and that new girl, Soda.

59:32.240 --> 59:36.995
I've always been pretty fuzzy, sir,
and this came through sharp as a knife.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.233
Lieutenant, I know I'm not
a real psychic like you.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.279
In fact, I just found out
I'm pregnant, and I didn't have a clue.

59:47.480 --> 59:50.711
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid so.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.718
You might be interested to know
that in our studies...

59:53.880 --> 59:57.429
...pregnancy has been shown
to heighten psychic ability.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.637
That's too bad because
I'd really like to be wrong.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:06.312
Yes, me too, but I keep having
the same feeling.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.755
What is it?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.876
They're coming to wipe us out.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.713
What's so new about that?

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.075
I mean the whole species, everything
human. And they have a plan.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.550
Look, after what I did in the battle...

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.280
...I wasn't very sure
of myself anymore.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.353
And I just figured everybody
thought I'd just cracked.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.393
Yesterday, I might have been
inclined to agree...

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.876
...but that would've been me
screwing up, lieutenant.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.396
Thank you, sir.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.834
I'll get on this matter
with General Shepherd immediately.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.992
Oh, and, trooper...

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.196
...that was some good work.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.237
Sir.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.795
General Shepherd?

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.835
What are you doing in here?

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.518
General Jack and I
were just having a chat.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.830
What are you doing here, Dill?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.797
You and Shepherd?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.476
Is that so hard to believe?

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.477
General?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.313
General Shepherd?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.397
General...

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.397
They're inside of you. Oh, God.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.358
Back up, or I'll drill your damn skull.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.949
Get back! Get away from the door.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.639
Get away.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.669
You bastards. You're all under arrest...

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.277
...for murder, sedition,
for treason against the Federation...

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.117
Oh, and you're gonna pay
because we're not gonna kill you.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.313
Oh, no. No, you see, we got
special places for things like you...

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.038
...where they cut you up.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.668
But they keep you alive
while they cut you up...

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.630
...so they can see what makes you tick,
and they'll see what makes you sick.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.597
And I'll be there. Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna be there to see...

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.434
You're under arrest, Dax.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.670
On what charge?

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.558
Murder.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.111
- Captain Dax, what's happening?
- No talking to the prisoner.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.955
Keep him covered.
You gave me your word, Dax.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.994
What makes you think I had
anything to do with this, general?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.868
- Lock him up, sergeant.
- Yes, sir. With pleasure, sir.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.316
- Get out of here now, Sahara.
- Move it.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.910
You know what to do, Billie.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.116
Yes, sir.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.718
Why are you doing this, Billie?

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.549
It's not you and me.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.596
You trying to make a baby
with my barracks door, private?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.078
Sahara, she don't want it,
but I gotta give her the Bug.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.360
- There's a wire loose in your head.
- No, it's a little piece of God.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.399
Not like the one people used
to believe in, or the Federation...

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.478
...and it's filling me up. I can sort
of feel myself floating away.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.478
Kid, you're not making any sense.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.758
You'll understand when you wake up.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.480
When I wake up?

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.511
- Don't fight.
- That'll be the day.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.951
No!

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.515
You Ionely, captain?

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.833
Billie, please don't. Please.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.075
What the hell's going on, sergeant?

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.677
- The Bugs are inside, sir.
- Inside the perimeter?

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.472
No, sir.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.712
Inside me.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.275
Sergeant, no! No!

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.153
Keys.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.315
- What the hell kind of Bug is that?
- Jesus.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.555
One that gets inside and takes over.
Maybe it can tell us something.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.991
What are you talking about?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.957
Everything that happened here
was supposed to happen.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.549
The Bugs brought us here
to create a weapon.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.593
- What kind of weapon?
- Shepherd!

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.390
He could bring this
to the top of the Federation!

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.393
We gotta kill the general.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.991
Fire in the hole!

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.674
You're gonna die!

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.956
They don't kill so easy, do they?

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.549
- You're gonna die!
- They're not like us, sir.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.877
Not anymore. They're Bugs.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.672
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.750
They shut down the reactors.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.714
Sandee?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.912
Grenade!

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.631
Sahara, you okay?

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.752
Poor creatures.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.714
Why must we destroy you?

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.472
I'll tell you why.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.595
Order is the tide of creation...

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.714
...but yours is a species...

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.555
...that worships the one over the many.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.032
You glorify your intelligence...

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.113
...because it allows you
to believe anything.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.030
That you have a destiny.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.310
That you have a right.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.150
That you have a cause.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.870
That you are special.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.831
That you are great.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.871
But in truth...

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.838
...you are born insane.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.154
And such misery...

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.354
...cannot be allowed...

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.430
...to spread.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.393
Kill them all!

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.548
Sahara! You get the general!

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.039
- General Shepherd!
- That's me!

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.677
You can't take him! Whatever you do,
don't let him onboard!

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.196
Hey, general!

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.229
Listen up. She needs medical attention.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.709
You just killed
a general officer, mister!

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.314
Lots of generals out there, flyboy!

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.275
This trooper's got information vital
to the survival of the Federation!

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.398
She must reach safety at all costs!
You get me?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.113
Yes, sir!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.669
- Let's go!
- There are too many of them, Dax!

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.594
You gotta tell them what you saw.
You gotta tell them about the new Bug!

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.392
You stay here, you'll die!

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.158
Murderers don't go home.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.594
Dax!

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.990
Dax!

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.629
Dax. More than a soldier,
not just a man.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.637
A hero of the Federation.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.153
He gave his life so we could fight...

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.590
...and these words for us to live by:

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.834
"Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever."

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.949
And now you too can live the glory...

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.874
...because it's easy to be a hero
in the Mobile Infantry.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.600
Men and women lik e you
are signing up every day...

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.638
...to serve the Federation
and save the galaxy!

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.711
Isn't it time you did your part?

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.279
Beautiful baby, ma'am.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.634
Thank you, sergeant.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.400
Think how impressed friends
and teachers will be!

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.834
Everyone loves a citizen!

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.319
Little trooper likes me.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.080
Sign up, and one day
they'll call you a hero too!

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.755
Hurry up, spud.
We need fresh meat for the grinder.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.390
Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever.
