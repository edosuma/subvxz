02:59.544 --> 03:01.545
Sheriff's deputy!

03:01.547 --> 03:04.113
Throw down your
weapon and surrender.

03:04.115 --> 03:05.417
No!

03:06.484 --> 03:07.619
No?

03:09.154 --> 03:10.656
No's not an option.

03:12.891 --> 03:14.894
You throw
your gun down then.

03:16.494 --> 03:17.929
That's not how this works.

03:20.097 --> 03:24.801
Well, looks like
the only solution

03:24.803 --> 03:28.141
is to throw our guns
down together.

03:30.142 --> 03:31.543
Fine.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.081
It's on my count.

03:36.681 --> 03:39.182
Well, how's that fair?
It was my idea.

03:39.184 --> 03:41.750
That's about as good a
deal as you're gonna get.

03:41.752 --> 03:43.185
Now you can either take it

03:43.187 --> 03:45.424
or we can let our
guns do the talking.

03:47.525 --> 03:48.594
Well?

03:51.697 --> 03:53.796
Fine, deal.

03:53.798 --> 03:54.897
All right.

03:57.536 --> 03:58.735
You ready?

03:58.737 --> 04:00.570
Yeah.

04:00.572 --> 04:01.841
One,

04:04.775 --> 04:05.911
two,

04:07.745 --> 04:08.945
three.

04:14.585 --> 04:16.851
What the hell was that?

04:16.853 --> 04:18.721
We had an agreement.

04:18.724 --> 04:21.190
Well, I'm a criminal.

04:21.192 --> 04:22.861
Supposed to be nefarious.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.599
That's true.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.599
Still,

04:30.601 --> 04:32.568
I'm gonna mark it down
as a victory for me.

04:32.570 --> 04:33.736
On what grounds?

04:33.738 --> 04:35.104
Shooting you dead.

04:35.106 --> 04:37.140
Pretty sure that clearly
constitutes a victory.

04:37.142 --> 04:39.478
How so?
You didn't even hit me.

04:40.846 --> 04:43.546
Well, you know the rules.

04:43.548 --> 04:46.750
In the event of an
unresolvable dispute...

04:46.752 --> 04:48.318
Tie goes to the deputy.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.822
Correct.

04:51.188 --> 04:53.957
Because criminals,
well, they never win.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.692
At least not in the long-term.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.126
Why do I always have
to be the criminal.

04:57.128 --> 04:58.827
We've been over this.

04:58.829 --> 05:01.864
Mask, it makes me
claustrophobic.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.868
What if the criminal
doesn't wear a mask?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.169
Now listen to yourself.

05:06.171 --> 05:08.104
You think a criminal's
gonna commit a crime

05:08.106 --> 05:11.308
without a mask or some
kind of tactical disguise?

05:11.310 --> 05:14.180
All right.

05:15.313 --> 05:16.979
You're right,
it's ridiculous.

05:16.981 --> 05:18.347
Uh-huh.

05:18.349 --> 05:20.952
Ugh, I'm hungry.

05:45.243 --> 05:47.310
Mind if I smoke?

05:47.312 --> 05:50.080
No, ma'am,
go right ahead.

05:50.082 --> 05:52.782
So, what
brings you to Shandaken?

05:52.784 --> 05:54.818
I was supposed to meet
my bride up in Albany,

05:54.820 --> 05:58.224
but there were
some complications.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.025
Well, at least you
seem in good spirits.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.260
Morning, deputies.

06:05.262 --> 06:06.599
Morning, Marla.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.137
We need a plan.

06:15.139 --> 06:16.839
Yeah.

06:16.841 --> 06:18.808
Well, how 'bout...

06:18.810 --> 06:20.310
There you go, boys.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.945
Thanks, Marla.

06:21.947 --> 06:27.217
How 'bout all of
the arrest records

06:27.219 --> 06:29.051
were burned up in a tragic fire

06:29.053 --> 06:31.256
that also took the lives
of three innocent people?

06:32.890 --> 06:34.957
Except we need the bodies.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.392
Oh yeah.

06:36.394 --> 06:38.863
Oh yeah, those are
hard to come by.

06:40.765 --> 06:42.000
Uh.

06:44.435 --> 06:45.669
I got it.

06:45.671 --> 06:46.702
Hmm?

06:46.704 --> 06:48.137
How 'bout this.

06:48.139 --> 06:50.806
We got so many arrests
that the boxes of records

06:50.808 --> 06:52.342
became cumbersome
around the office,

06:52.344 --> 06:54.710
so we had no choice
but to ship the records

06:54.712 --> 06:57.147
to a storage facility
just north of Albany.

06:57.149 --> 07:01.685
Shortly after they arrived,
it was ravaged by fire.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.019
- I like that.
- You like that?

07:03.021 --> 07:04.820
- Yeah.
- All right, good.

07:04.822 --> 07:06.091
Then that's the plan.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.359
Still got an hour and a half
till the sheriff gets here.

07:10.361 --> 07:13.898
Who knows, something might
happen between now and then.

07:26.478 --> 07:27.947
Excuse me, sir.

07:29.714 --> 07:31.250
Anything we can help you with?

07:32.384 --> 07:33.653
No, sir.

07:35.152 --> 07:36.986
Oh, well, I was
beaten and robbed

07:36.988 --> 07:39.325
by a pack of teenagers
this morning.

07:40.759 --> 07:42.157
In Shandaken?

07:42.159 --> 07:43.726
No, Albany.

07:43.728 --> 07:45.995
I'm just driving through.

07:45.997 --> 07:47.996
Well, that's outside
our jurisdiction,

07:47.998 --> 07:50.299
but if you like we can
aid you in filing

07:50.301 --> 07:52.868
a criminal complaint with the
Albany sheriff's department.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.203
Uh, no, no.

07:54.205 --> 07:56.675
I wouldn't wanna go
through all the trouble.

08:00.245 --> 08:02.044
What's the matter
with the pie?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.512
Oh, sheriff's
coming to town today

08:03.514 --> 08:05.347
to review quarterly
arrest records.

08:05.349 --> 08:08.119
So, that's no reason
to waste food.

08:12.022 --> 08:13.188
Yes, ma'am.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.292
Yep.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.195
Mmm.

08:19.197 --> 08:20.863
All right?

08:20.865 --> 08:22.364
Yeah.

08:22.366 --> 08:25.904
Yeah, we unfortunately
haven't made an arrest

08:27.104 --> 08:28.505
this quarter.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.873
Or the three
quarters before that.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.308
Yeah, and in the six years
prior to that,

08:32.309 --> 08:33.876
we only made one arrest.

08:35.113 --> 08:37.013
And that son of
a bitch got away.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.116
Oh yeah.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.451
Turns out it's not illegal

08:41.453 --> 08:45.154
to fish without a license
if you don't catch anything.

08:45.156 --> 08:47.490
Marla, let me
ask you something.

08:47.492 --> 08:49.958
You'd say you know us
pretty good, right?

08:49.960 --> 08:52.828
We're practically family.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.164
You think we're good deputies?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.033
Well, the way I see it,

08:57.035 --> 08:59.101
if you're not arresting anyone,

08:59.103 --> 09:02.337
it means there's no crime,
and if there's no crime,

09:02.339 --> 09:06.009
it means that you two are
pretty darn good deputies.

09:06.011 --> 09:09.044
Uh-huh. And that is exactly
what we'll tell the sheriff.

09:09.046 --> 09:10.145
Thanks, Marla.

09:10.147 --> 09:11.246
What's the damage?

09:11.248 --> 09:13.116
Two cents for my two cents.

09:13.118 --> 09:16.385
The rest, as usual,
on the house.

09:16.387 --> 09:18.154
Are you kidding about
that two cents, Marla?

09:18.156 --> 09:19.856
I don't carry change.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.491
It doesn't feel
good in my pockets.

09:21.493 --> 09:22.994
Oh, forget it.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.013
Get out of there.

09:51.455 --> 09:52.521
Sheriff.

09:53.557 --> 09:54.926
Morning, sir.

09:56.127 --> 09:57.930
Can I offer you a pastry, sir?

09:59.564 --> 10:00.866
Awful tasty.

10:06.271 --> 10:07.339
Yes, sir.

10:10.275 --> 10:11.640
Good choice.

10:11.642 --> 10:14.512
Yes, sir.

10:16.314 --> 10:18.347
How was your trip, sir?

10:18.349 --> 10:20.350
Alone.

10:20.352 --> 10:21.921
That's good, I guess.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.465
I got a deposition 30 minutes
right outside Kingston,

10:35.467 --> 10:38.500
so let's skip the pleasantries

10:38.502 --> 10:40.403
and get right down
to brass tacks.

10:40.405 --> 10:41.874
Yes, sir.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.942
Well?

10:45.944 --> 10:48.144
Well, I got some good news
for you, sheriff.

10:48.146 --> 10:49.544
No arrests to
review this quarter.

10:49.546 --> 10:51.481
What we figure is
if there's no arrests,

10:51.483 --> 10:53.949
one could extrapolate
that there's no crime.

10:53.951 --> 10:55.584
And if there's no crime,
then all in all,

10:55.586 --> 10:58.221
I'd say we're doing
a pretty bang up job.

10:58.223 --> 10:59.391
Sir.

11:02.227 --> 11:08.331
Well, I mean if
there's no crime,

11:08.333 --> 11:10.632
well then, why would I need
a deputy in Shandaken,

11:10.634 --> 11:13.068
much less two of them.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.504
Well, God forbid
there is a crime, sir,

11:14.506 --> 11:17.406
- we would protect the citizenry.
- Uh-huh.

11:17.408 --> 11:20.242
So, we're kind of worried
about hypothetical crime.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.644
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm.

11:21.646 --> 11:24.047
As well as the threat
of actual crime,

11:24.049 --> 11:27.015
which is always omnipresent.

11:27.017 --> 11:30.019
What, what, what
Deputy Hayford means to say

11:30.021 --> 11:33.289
is um, we, uh,

11:33.291 --> 11:36.458
we just, um,

11:36.460 --> 11:39.428
don't have the reports.

11:39.430 --> 11:44.000
We don't have the
reports for the crimes,

11:44.002 --> 11:46.970
which there were
a lot of crimes.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.638
That's correct.
That's right.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.740
You know, I was
playing coy earlier.

11:50.742 --> 11:52.976
I didn't wanna toot my own horn,

11:52.978 --> 11:55.444
but truth be told,
we've made so many arrests,

11:55.446 --> 11:58.715
you know, that the boxes
of records were piling up

11:58.717 --> 12:00.750
and becoming cumbersome
around the office.

12:00.752 --> 12:03.318
I mean, there must've
been, I lost count,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.188
so we went ahead and
shipped those up north,

12:06.190 --> 12:08.457
- just north of Albany.
- Yeah.

12:08.459 --> 12:09.692
- Was it?
- Yeah.

12:09.694 --> 12:11.159
- That's where it was.
- Yeah.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.029
And, here's the kicker, sir.

12:13.031 --> 12:16.164
When they got there, the whole
thing was ravaged by fire.

12:16.166 --> 12:20.035
Everything gone,
all of it, just burnt up.

12:20.037 --> 12:22.270
Typical, late firemen.

12:22.272 --> 12:25.007
Well, don't throw
them under the bus.

12:25.009 --> 12:26.241
Mmm.

12:26.243 --> 12:29.412
Well, now,
now let me be clear here.

12:29.414 --> 12:33.116
See, your duty is
to serve and protect

12:33.118 --> 12:36.552
the good people of
Shandaken, right?

12:36.554 --> 12:39.188
And the way we show that we
are serving and protecting

12:39.190 --> 12:40.423
the good people of Shandaken,

12:40.425 --> 12:42.125
is arrests and convictions.

12:42.127 --> 12:44.193
Now, now, my budget
is controlled

12:44.195 --> 12:46.596
by a bunch of son of a bitch
politicians up in Albany

12:46.598 --> 12:48.430
and you know what
they really like?

12:48.432 --> 12:50.600
- Money.
- Prostitutes.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.538
Results.

12:54.506 --> 12:56.105
And when they don't see results,

12:56.107 --> 12:57.640
well, they, they reduce
my budget

12:57.642 --> 13:01.644
and I just don't like
having my budget reduced.

13:01.646 --> 13:03.312
Mm-mm.

13:03.314 --> 13:06.082
Now, wearing that badge
is a privilege

13:06.084 --> 13:08.518
and goddamn it, your arrest
records reflect poorly

13:08.520 --> 13:10.620
on every man who's had
the honor of pinning that

13:10.622 --> 13:12.091
to his uniform.

13:13.724 --> 13:17.492
So effective immediately,
your employment

13:17.494 --> 13:20.365
at the Shandaken sheriff's
department is terminated.

13:23.767 --> 13:26.671
I'm gonna need your badges
and your firearms.

13:41.386 --> 13:42.385
Easy.

13:42.387 --> 13:45.123
There you go.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.790
Someone from human
resources up in Albany

13:48.792 --> 13:51.526
will contact you about
your pensions presently.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.531
You got till the end of the day

13:56.533 --> 13:58.703
to clear out your
personal effects.

14:01.705 --> 14:04.307
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:04.309 --> 14:05.444
I'm due in Kingston.

14:20.757 --> 14:21.857
What are you doing?

14:21.859 --> 14:23.228
Packing up.

14:25.463 --> 14:27.230
You just wanna quit?

14:27.232 --> 14:29.298
We didn't quit, Thurman,

14:29.300 --> 14:31.199
we got fired.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.637
Let me ask you something, Jim.

14:34.238 --> 14:36.739
If we're not deputies,
then what the hell are we?

14:36.741 --> 14:38.274
We're nothing.

14:38.276 --> 14:40.344
Wrong, we're worse
than nothing.

14:43.515 --> 14:44.614
We're civilians.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.428
Shandaken sheriff's department.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.898
<i>I need to
speak to the sheriff,</i>

15:01.900 --> 15:03.866
- <i>post-haste.</i>
- Who's calling?

15:03.868 --> 15:07.403
<i>This is Warden Arthur B. Cox,</i>

15:07.405 --> 15:09.539
Adirondack County Correctional.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.173
Well, I'm sorry, Warden.

15:11.175 --> 15:12.607
Sheriff's got a
deposition in Kingston.

15:12.609 --> 15:14.342
If you wait a couple hours,
you're likely

15:14.344 --> 15:15.811
to reach him
at the courthouse.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.612
No, no, no.
Can't wait.

15:17.614 --> 15:19.118
Is there a deputy on duty?

15:21.752 --> 15:24.720
Yes, sir, two deputies
on duty.

15:24.722 --> 15:28.191
<i>Well then, deputy,
hold on to your johnson.</i>

15:28.193 --> 15:29.457
We're not deputies.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.793
- Shh.
- <i>This morning at O600,</i>

15:30.795 --> 15:34.563
head check came up
one short, prisoner 614.

15:34.565 --> 15:35.664
Fine then.

15:35.666 --> 15:37.699
<i>COs discovered a tunnel,</i>

15:37.701 --> 15:41.803
hidden behind the
toilet in his cell,

15:41.805 --> 15:44.539
spanned 400 feet.

15:44.541 --> 15:48.213
Son of a bitch must've
held it for months.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.545
<i>Anyhow,</i>

15:50.547 --> 15:53.515
we got word
that a hunting party

15:53.517 --> 15:57.419
saw a fella in shackles,
matching his description,

15:57.421 --> 15:59.487
up on Slide Mountain.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.557
<i>Now, if I'm not mistaken,</i>

16:01.559 --> 16:06.228
<i>that sits square within the
middle of your jurisdiction.</i>

16:06.230 --> 16:07.365
Yes, sir, it does.

16:08.432 --> 16:09.934
Good, any questions?

16:11.002 --> 16:12.570
Uh, yes, sir.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.605
What do you want us to do?

16:15.607 --> 16:19.942
Well, for starters,
catch the son of a bitch.

16:19.944 --> 16:25.414
- He murdered a deputy in cold blood, back in '58.
- Jesus.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.417
Left a widow and
three daughters.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.686
<i>So, if anything happens,</i>

16:30.688 --> 16:34.693
<i>nobody's gonna lose sleep
over a dead cop-killer.</i>

16:35.926 --> 16:37.592
<i>Godspeed, deputy.</i>

16:37.594 --> 16:40.763
I'm counting on you.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.365
Yes, sir, and I just
wanna let you know,

16:42.367 --> 16:43.566
on behalf of the...

16:43.568 --> 16:44.899
Hello?

16:44.901 --> 16:47.535
Is he gone?
He's gone.

16:53.377 --> 16:54.943
I know what we're gonna do.

16:54.945 --> 16:57.579
Nothing.
We ain't doing nothing.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.450
You heard the sheriff
as same as I did.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.818
We're gonna hike out
to Slide Mountain,

17:02.820 --> 17:05.623
capture the prisoner,
return him to justice.

17:06.891 --> 17:08.790
We'll be heroes.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.026
Sheriff will have no choice,
but to give us our jobs back.

17:11.028 --> 17:15.499
Thurman, we swore an oath

17:16.566 --> 17:17.635
to uphold the law.

17:19.403 --> 17:21.803
It seems awful
wrong to break it.

17:21.805 --> 17:23.839
Tell me, Jim, what law
are we breaking?

17:23.840 --> 17:26.409
Impersonating an officer.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.678
We're not
impersonating anyone.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.980
Badge or no badge,
we're deputies.

17:31.982 --> 17:34.316
And you're right,
we did swear an oath

17:34.318 --> 17:36.485
to the good people of Shandaken.

17:36.487 --> 17:39.421
And I'll be damned if I leave
them in their time of need.

17:39.423 --> 17:42.524
There's a cold-blooded
killer out there, Jim.

17:42.526 --> 17:45.796
And goddamn it,
we're gonna find him.

17:46.963 --> 17:48.666
Get your hat.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.092
We head out in the wilderness,
we capture the prisoner,

18:16.094 --> 18:17.726
return him to justice,
at which point,

18:17.728 --> 18:19.562
we will inevitably
be hailed as heroes

18:19.564 --> 18:20.862
and the sheriff
will have no choice

18:20.864 --> 18:22.732
but to give us our jobs back.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.566
That's a dynamite plan.

18:24.568 --> 18:27.469
- See?
- And no one's disputing that.

18:27.471 --> 18:30.038
What makes you think
that we can find him,

18:30.040 --> 18:32.108
much less apprehend him?

18:32.110 --> 18:35.009
The Slide Mountain
wilderness is 45,000 acres

18:35.011 --> 18:36.644
of rugged beauty.

18:36.646 --> 18:38.046
He could be anywhere.

18:38.048 --> 18:39.614
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the fact that

18:39.616 --> 18:41.015
we're highly-trained
sheriff's deputies.

18:41.017 --> 18:42.685
We've been training for
this our entire lives.

18:42.687 --> 18:45.053
This whole, a culmination
of all of our experience.

18:45.055 --> 18:46.788
- We don't even have our guns.
- It's just an apex of things that we've learned.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.057
We don't have our guns.
What are we gonna do?

18:49.059 --> 18:51.526
This man killed a
deputy in cold blood.

18:51.528 --> 18:56.031
What makes you figure he's just
gonna give up to us willingly, huh?

18:56.033 --> 18:58.066
Still have the
keys to the outpost.

18:58.068 --> 18:59.634
Take munitions from there.

18:59.636 --> 19:00.803
Your solution is to burgle?

19:00.805 --> 19:02.170
No, my solution's not...

19:02.172 --> 19:03.906
no one's gonna burgle.

19:03.908 --> 19:06.108
Obviously return 'em once
this whole thing's over with.

19:06.110 --> 19:09.745
- You see, legally, that's borrowing.
- Thank you.

19:09.747 --> 19:13.015
How do you borrow bullets
that you took and shot?

19:13.017 --> 19:14.649
That doesn't make sense.

19:14.651 --> 19:16.118
- You can't...
- Sure, you can.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.686
What are you gonna,
it's a used bullet.

19:17.688 --> 19:20.089
Little IOUs, little IOUs.
We'll tally 'em out.

19:20.091 --> 19:22.425
So then, it's not
a borrowing situation.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.691
No, it's an IOU situation.

19:23.693 --> 19:24.794
And you know what,
that's honorable.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.195
People honor IOUs.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.929
Our word is our bond
and I'm done arguing

19:27.931 --> 19:29.165
about this with you.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.966
Look at me.

19:30.968 --> 19:32.738
Are you in or are you out?

19:37.975 --> 19:39.073
Thurman, wait.

19:39.075 --> 19:40.708
No, remind me one more time.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.478
If we're not deputies,
then what the hell are we?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.613
Oh, I hate to interject,

19:45.615 --> 19:48.984
but that'll be $2.85

19:48.986 --> 19:50.585
for the meatloaf and the shakes.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.621
I beg your pardon?

19:52.623 --> 19:58.526
$2 and 85 cents for the
meatloafs and the shakes,

19:58.528 --> 20:00.431
plus a gratuity if you'd like.

20:01.766 --> 20:04.800
Uh, Marla, it's always
been on the house.

20:04.802 --> 20:07.101
Well, that was different.

20:07.103 --> 20:08.973
You used to be deputies.

20:12.977 --> 20:15.013
- I'm in.
- Uh-huh.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.215
Marla, I'm gonna
have to owe you.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.615
But we will pay.

20:33.898 --> 20:36.067
All right,
here's the plan,

20:37.133 --> 20:39.235
0800, begin pursuit of prisoner.

20:39.237 --> 20:40.703
Yep.

20:40.705 --> 20:42.271
1200, break for
lunch, which is?

20:42.273 --> 20:44.707
- Sandwich platter.
- All right.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.810
1300 hours, continue
pursuit of prisoner.

20:47.812 --> 20:50.545
Now here's the part where
it gets a little bit fuzzy,

20:50.547 --> 20:53.615
but I estimate that some time
between 1400 and 1600 hours,

20:53.617 --> 20:56.017
we'll apprehend the prisoner,
set up camp for the night,

20:56.019 --> 20:57.820
and head on back in the morning.

20:57.822 --> 21:00.788
So, best guess, I'd say
everything'll be back to normal

21:00.790 --> 21:03.124
by 1300 tomorrow,
which for my money,

21:03.126 --> 21:05.194
can't come soon enough.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.729
Now, what do we got for rations?

21:07.731 --> 21:11.166
A lunch and dinner today,
breakfast tomorrow,

21:11.168 --> 21:14.303
and assorted snacks
and refreshments.

21:14.305 --> 21:16.738
All right, good.
Anything beyond that,

21:16.740 --> 21:18.873
we'll just have to hunt
and kill ourselves.

21:18.875 --> 21:19.978
Map.

21:21.778 --> 21:23.815
Map. Map.

21:30.654 --> 21:32.821
- Map.
- Yep.

21:32.823 --> 21:36.824
The Slide Mountain wilderness
comprises 47,500 acres

21:36.826 --> 21:38.627
and 16 peaks.

21:38.629 --> 21:42.297
Marked foot trails provide
access to the remote interior,

21:42.299 --> 21:45.199
traversing rocky summits
that are thick

21:45.201 --> 21:47.835
with balsam forest,
home to a host of wildlife,

21:47.837 --> 21:49.804
including black bears,
whitetail deer,

21:49.806 --> 21:52.140
porcupine, and snowshoe hare.

21:52.142 --> 21:56.277
The Burr-ohs Range,
made up of Slide, Cornell,

21:56.279 --> 22:00.248
Wittenberg Mountains, is
named for famed naturalist,

22:00.250 --> 22:02.317
John Burr-ohs.

22:02.319 --> 22:04.119
- Burroughs.
- Burr-ohs.

22:04.121 --> 22:05.286
Burroughs.

22:05.288 --> 22:06.822
Burr-ohs.

22:06.824 --> 22:08.924
Its imposing beauty
inspired him to write,

22:08.926 --> 22:14.862
quote, "Here the works of
man dwindle," end quote.

22:14.864 --> 22:18.167
A plaque commemorating
Burr-ohs, is permanently affixed

22:18.169 --> 22:21.970
to the summit rock on the
Catskill's highest peak,

22:21.972 --> 22:23.074
Slide Mountain.

22:24.741 --> 22:27.177
We should visit that,
if we have time.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.815
Which way then?

22:35.251 --> 22:36.951
Up.

22:36.953 --> 22:38.320
Up, up.

22:38.322 --> 22:39.623
Up.

23:59.836 --> 24:01.969
Hey, how much you wanna
bet I can shoot this can

24:01.971 --> 24:03.374
off that rock in one shot?

24:05.476 --> 24:06.742
That one?

24:06.744 --> 24:07.911
This can right here.

24:09.212 --> 24:10.949
Depends how far away you are.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.785
15 paces?

24:21.792 --> 24:23.261
I got a buck says you can't.

24:26.497 --> 24:30.168
Oh, dropped your gun.

24:31.199 --> 24:31.335
Yep.

24:45.815 --> 24:47.017
15 paces.

24:54.491 --> 24:57.092
That's $1, my friend.

24:57.094 --> 24:59.361
Double or nothing.

25:05.001 --> 25:06.534
Double or nothing again.

25:11.842 --> 25:14.112
- Again.
- I like those odds.

25:15.446 --> 25:17.845
Well, if it's so easy,
why don't you try it?

25:17.847 --> 25:18.882
Double or nothing.

25:34.331 --> 25:37.533
All right, how 'bout
first one to hit it

25:37.535 --> 25:40.201
- wins five bucks.
- All right.

25:52.016 --> 25:53.383
Shit.

26:18.007 --> 26:19.209
Hurry up.

26:23.413 --> 26:26.148
Hey, did you
pack the reserves?

26:26.150 --> 26:29.150
Reserves?
What reserves?

26:29.152 --> 26:32.521
The reserve ammo for
sport and recreation.

26:32.523 --> 26:34.622
I didn't bring
any reserve ammo.

26:34.624 --> 26:36.457
You didn't bring any reserves.

26:36.459 --> 26:39.194
I packed a big bag of bullets.

26:39.196 --> 26:40.629
One bag of bullets?

26:40.631 --> 26:42.397
A big bag.

26:42.399 --> 26:44.466
Well, we're out, Jim.

26:44.468 --> 26:46.368
Quit joking, Thurman.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.540
There ain't no ties
in gun-shootin'.

26:49.606 --> 26:51.175
I ain't joking.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.611
I knew this was a
bad idea from the get-go.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.512
All right, just calm down,
let me think, all right?

26:57.514 --> 26:59.581
My ears are ringing.
I can't hear myself...

26:59.583 --> 27:01.416
- We gotta turn back.
- I'll come up with another plan.

27:01.418 --> 27:04.887
We're not turning back.
Deputies do not turn back.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.421
Well, we're not
deputies anymore, are we?

27:07.423 --> 27:09.157
We're out of ammo,

27:09.159 --> 27:11.293
we don't know
where the prisoner is,

27:11.295 --> 27:14.595
and goddamn it,
I'm getting hungry again.

27:14.597 --> 27:18.667
Okay, I can't help but
feel a little attacked right now.

27:18.669 --> 27:21.238
Well, sorry, but...

27:23.908 --> 27:25.974
under the current...

27:25.976 --> 27:28.476
You know, the way I see it,
you got a gun pointed at you,

27:28.478 --> 27:31.213
you ain't worried about
whether or not it's loaded.

27:31.215 --> 27:32.851
That's your plan?

27:34.317 --> 27:36.083
Ah!

27:36.085 --> 27:37.255
It's a bee.

27:38.322 --> 27:39.621
I'm allergic.

27:39.623 --> 27:41.390
Ah!

27:41.392 --> 27:43.190
There's a lot of bees.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.430
Stop doing that, anyway.

27:57.574 --> 27:59.276
We'll start losing light soon.

28:00.276 --> 28:02.476
We should make camp here.

28:02.478 --> 28:06.480
I think if we just have a
nice good meal by the fire,

28:06.482 --> 28:08.449
we'll sit and think
about what to do

28:08.451 --> 28:09.717
for the next couple days.

28:09.719 --> 28:12.086
Oh, beg your pardon?

28:12.088 --> 28:13.621
Well, it's gonna take at least
a couple more days out here

28:13.623 --> 28:15.157
at the rate we're going.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.059
We only got enough
rations till tomorrow.

28:17.061 --> 28:18.459
Well, then we'll
hunt our own food.

28:18.461 --> 28:20.062
With what bullets?

28:20.064 --> 28:22.197
Well, we got knives, don't we?

28:22.199 --> 28:25.167
You gonna pounce on a
squirrel and stab it to death?

28:25.169 --> 28:27.468
Jesus.

28:27.470 --> 28:28.570
Huh?

28:28.572 --> 28:30.104
No, that's grim,

28:30.106 --> 28:31.341
it's a grim thought.

28:33.344 --> 28:35.142
I just think if we
stick to the plan,

28:35.144 --> 28:36.611
everything'll be okay.

28:38.515 --> 28:40.047
Well, the plan ain't working.

28:47.623 --> 28:49.123
Did you see what I did?

28:49.125 --> 28:51.293
What?
What'd I miss?

28:51.295 --> 28:53.163
- What'd I miss?
- Shhh.

29:03.774 --> 29:05.340
Excuse me, sheriff's deputy,

29:05.342 --> 29:07.109
we'd like a word with you,
folks.

29:07.111 --> 29:08.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:08.478 --> 29:10.478
Put those guns down right now.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.080
Drop 'em.

29:12.082 --> 29:14.017
Put 'em down.

29:15.119 --> 29:16.220
Put 'em down.

29:18.221 --> 29:19.623
Drop 'em.

29:21.091 --> 29:22.791
Easy, easy.

29:22.793 --> 29:25.393
We're just out here
hunting, that's all.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.231
Lower it, put it down.

29:31.567 --> 29:34.335
Alexi and his brother here,

29:34.337 --> 29:36.670
I hired them to help me
bag a black bear.

29:36.672 --> 29:39.274
It's gonna look
real good in my foyer.

29:39.276 --> 29:42.710
You say you're
sheriff's deputies.

29:42.712 --> 29:44.446
I see no badges.

29:44.448 --> 29:47.515
How do we know we're
not being bamboozled?

29:47.517 --> 29:52.621
This one has big beautiful
blue eyes, like porcelain doll.

29:54.624 --> 29:57.391
How long you been
sheriff deputy?

29:57.393 --> 29:58.759
Two days?

29:58.761 --> 30:00.495
Since the day I was born.

30:03.566 --> 30:06.234
That is something
sheriff deputy would say.

30:06.236 --> 30:07.601
Okay, okay.

30:07.603 --> 30:09.336
Listen, we're
tracking a prisoner.

30:09.338 --> 30:11.672
He murdered a
deputy in cold blood

30:11.674 --> 30:14.075
and he's on the loose
somewhere in these mountains.

30:14.077 --> 30:15.643
Now, I apologize, but I'm
afraid we're gonna have to

30:15.645 --> 30:17.144
commandeer your munitions.

30:17.146 --> 30:18.213
Munitions?

30:18.215 --> 30:20.082
All we gots shells, man.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.484
You ever try to take down
a black bear with a pistol?

30:22.486 --> 30:24.486
All you're gonna do is piss
that son of a bitch off,

30:24.488 --> 30:26.153
I guarantee it.

30:26.155 --> 30:27.721
Well, then we'll take
a couple of those rifles

30:27.723 --> 30:29.658
off your hands too.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.592
- No, no, no, no.
- I'll make a deal with you.

30:31.594 --> 30:32.593
If I give you these rifles,

30:32.595 --> 30:34.329
you boys'll skedaddle?

30:34.331 --> 30:35.466
That's right.

30:38.434 --> 30:40.701
All right, give it to him.

30:40.703 --> 30:43.271
That's all right.

30:45.409 --> 30:46.774
We're gonna
need the ammo too,

30:46.776 --> 30:49.046
- all of it.
- All of it?

30:49.813 --> 30:51.479
That's right.

30:51.481 --> 30:53.148
There's a cold-blooded
killer on the loose

30:53.150 --> 30:54.682
and we gotta catch him.

30:54.684 --> 30:57.585
All right.
Time for you boys to get!

30:57.587 --> 30:59.487
Wow.

30:59.489 --> 31:01.156
Being awful rude.

31:01.158 --> 31:02.791
I ain't being rude.
You the one that interrupted us.

31:02.793 --> 31:05.560
We out here minding
our own damn business.

31:05.562 --> 31:07.732
Why you so anxious
for us to go?

31:09.565 --> 31:11.899
You are repelling animals.

31:11.901 --> 31:14.236
- What?
- Huh?

31:14.238 --> 31:19.474
You are repelling animals.

31:19.476 --> 31:22.343
I'm still not getting it, but I think
that you guys are hiding something.

31:22.345 --> 31:23.611
He's hiding
something in his cheeks.

31:23.613 --> 31:25.412
- I ain't hiding shit.
- No.

31:25.414 --> 31:27.215
Well, why
don't you step aside?

31:27.217 --> 31:29.187
- No.
- Step aside, that's an order.

31:31.854 --> 31:34.221
God damn it.

31:34.223 --> 31:37.258
All right.
They's trapping.

31:37.260 --> 31:39.326
Can't do that.
It's illegal.

31:39.328 --> 31:42.464
Where we're from,
perfectly legal.

31:42.466 --> 31:45.332
- Legal.
- Well, in this country, it's illegal.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.835
- Yeah.
- And you gotta stop doing that or I'll arrest you.

31:47.837 --> 31:49.638
What about your
goddamn prisoner?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.872
Goddamn it,
that's out business.

31:51.874 --> 31:53.675
Now, look, I'll...

31:53.677 --> 31:55.476
I'll let you off with a warning

31:55.478 --> 31:57.678
if you promise just to
stop setting these traps.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.813
Okay, okay, we'll stop.

31:59.815 --> 32:02.717
- No promises.
- Good.

32:02.719 --> 32:05.352
And if you see and
suspicious acts,

32:05.354 --> 32:08.456
just make sure you alert
the proper authorities,

32:08.458 --> 32:10.393
like us, okay?

32:11.827 --> 32:13.428
What about that?

32:13.430 --> 32:14.696
- That about that?
- Zat about zat?

32:14.698 --> 32:16.230
That.

32:16.232 --> 32:17.698
- That, about that.
- Zat.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.902
That.

32:20.970 --> 32:24.238
- That.
- Where's he pointing?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.376
- Hold that.
- Yeah.

32:27.978 --> 32:29.779
He's still pointing over there.

32:31.414 --> 32:32.447
You see anything?

32:32.449 --> 32:34.485
Yep.
Take a look.

32:38.721 --> 32:40.554
Oh, there's
a fire over there.

32:40.556 --> 32:41.592
You got it.

32:42.625 --> 32:43.894
We should go there.

32:44.928 --> 32:46.527
- Come on.
- Let's go.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.664
Thank you.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.700
Sorry about the wait, sheriff.

32:52.702 --> 32:54.502
It's my first day
and I'm still trying

32:54.504 --> 32:56.371
to get a handle on things.

32:56.373 --> 33:00.475
Folks have been
really nice, patient too.

33:00.477 --> 33:02.613
Can you remind me what
you want on your potato.

33:04.347 --> 33:05.449
The works.

33:06.616 --> 33:07.951
The works.

33:11.520 --> 33:16.457
Sour cream, bacon,
scallions, cheddar cheese,

33:16.459 --> 33:17.594
the works.

33:19.328 --> 33:23.733
Sour cream, bacon, scallions,

33:24.767 --> 33:25.937
cheddar cheese.

33:27.770 --> 33:30.740
All right, is there anything
else I can do for you?

33:42.385 --> 33:44.018
Bless us, oh lord,

33:44.020 --> 33:47.357
for these thy gifts we're about
to receive from your bounty.

33:48.392 --> 33:52.526
Through Christ, our lord, amen.

34:02.405 --> 34:03.573
Phone call for you, sir.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.083
What is it?

34:15.085 --> 34:17.388
<i>Sheriff, Warden Cox.</i>

34:18.955 --> 34:20.821
State your business, Warden.

34:20.822 --> 34:23.491
<i>Given the gravity
of our situation,</i>

34:23.493 --> 34:27.495
<i>I expected an update on
the status of our prisoner,</i>

34:27.496 --> 34:29.663
<i>professional courtesy aside.</i>

34:29.665 --> 34:34.069
This one hell of a blemish
on the otherwise alabaster

34:34.071 --> 34:36.638
complexion of my penitentiary!

34:36.639 --> 34:41.576
<i>Now, I spoke to your deputies
down in Shandaken yesterday.</i>

34:41.578 --> 34:44.078
<i>I don't know what
your boys do down there.</i>

34:44.080 --> 34:47.614
<i>I guess I just assumed
that they would inform you</i>

34:47.616 --> 34:48.949
<i>of the goings-on.</i>

34:48.951 --> 34:52.087
Warden, with all due respect,

34:52.089 --> 34:54.522
this is the first I'm
hearing about prisoner...

34:54.524 --> 34:55.723
<i>614!</i>

34:55.725 --> 34:57.294
Prisoner 614.

35:02.698 --> 35:04.467
Oh, all right.

35:06.035 --> 35:07.738
Sure, sheriff.

35:09.705 --> 35:12.073
Me neither.

35:12.075 --> 35:15.743
Just make sure they
get rid of the body.

35:15.745 --> 35:17.879
<i>I got enough bad press
up here as it is.</i>

35:17.881 --> 35:21.982
I don't need that shit storm
rolling through here.

35:21.984 --> 35:24.386
Now you listen to me, Warden.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.054
Now, I swear to God,
you better tell me

35:26.056 --> 35:27.721
what the hell's
going on or I will...

35:27.723 --> 35:29.591
<i>Oh, don't worry
'bout me, sheriff.</i>

35:29.593 --> 35:31.025
<i>I'm a vault.</i>

35:31.027 --> 35:34.828
We never even had
this conversation.

35:57.486 --> 35:58.988
Are we sure it's him?

36:01.591 --> 36:02.859
It's him.

36:16.872 --> 36:18.075
Oooh.

36:20.176 --> 36:21.711
Freeze!

36:22.946 --> 36:24.081
Sheriff deputy.

36:28.585 --> 36:29.720
I know who you are.

36:32.721 --> 36:34.924
Caught ya.

36:36.058 --> 36:37.625
Stand up nice and slow.

36:37.627 --> 36:39.764
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

36:42.665 --> 36:43.968
Okay, hands up!

36:46.136 --> 36:48.569
Now, taking you in

36:48.571 --> 36:50.772
and that's just the
way it's gotta be.

36:50.774 --> 36:52.076
Shit!

36:54.877 --> 36:57.178
Please don't,
please don't shoot me.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.547
Please, I'm so sorry.

36:59.549 --> 37:01.549
I didn't, I'm so sorry.

37:01.551 --> 37:03.518
I'm not even a police officer.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.487
If you're into killing cops,

37:05.489 --> 37:07.124
I'm not even a police officer.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.960
You better put that gun down

37:12.962 --> 37:14.728
or I will literally shoot
you in the back of the head

37:14.730 --> 37:16.096
with this rifle.

37:16.098 --> 37:18.435
Get on your knees.

37:20.603 --> 37:21.739
That's right.

37:23.839 --> 37:26.241
Easy, easy.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.275
Jim, you wanna compose yourself
and come over here?

37:28.277 --> 37:29.580
Yeah.

37:30.747 --> 37:32.216
Prisoner 614,

37:33.984 --> 37:36.250
you are under arrest for escape.

37:36.252 --> 37:40.221
Anything you say at this...

37:40.223 --> 37:42.022
Wanna grab your gun?

37:42.024 --> 37:43.227
Yeah.

37:45.861 --> 37:48.830
- You all right?
- You saved my life.

37:48.832 --> 37:50.598
Well, hell yeah.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.201
This sorry excuse for a man's
already killed one deputy.

37:53.203 --> 37:54.569
Not about to let him
do it again,

37:54.571 --> 37:55.569
much less my partner.

37:55.571 --> 37:56.870
I ain't killed nobody.

37:56.872 --> 37:59.140
Hey, prisoner.

37:59.142 --> 38:00.574
I'm gonna tell you
this one time,

38:00.576 --> 38:02.310
I'm gonna tell it to you plain.

38:02.312 --> 38:05.078
We ask the questions around here
and I don't recall asking you

38:05.080 --> 38:07.915
"are you a killer," because
the answer's obviously yes,

38:07.917 --> 38:10.817
- yes, you are.
- No, I'm not, deputy.

38:10.819 --> 38:12.886
Be a good sport, prisoner.

38:12.888 --> 38:14.757
You lost fair and square.

38:15.759 --> 38:17.828
Nobody likes a sore loser.

38:20.931 --> 38:21.999
You got your cuffs?

38:28.138 --> 38:30.605
Let me make something abundantly
clear to you, prisoner.

38:30.607 --> 38:32.674
Your now in the
custody of not one,

38:32.676 --> 38:34.641
but two sheriff's deputies
from the Shandaken

38:34.643 --> 38:36.277
sheriff's department.

38:36.279 --> 38:38.011
It's our job to escort
you back to prison.

38:38.013 --> 38:39.849
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

38:41.350 --> 38:44.652
If you look like you're even
thinking about escapin' again,

38:44.654 --> 38:46.587
we shoot.

38:46.589 --> 38:48.255
I've been training
for this exact moment

38:48.257 --> 38:49.926
my entire life, you understand?

38:54.763 --> 38:57.265
I owe you an apology, Thurman.

38:57.267 --> 38:58.600
No need.

38:58.602 --> 39:01.969
No, it's like you said.

39:01.971 --> 39:04.073
Badge or no badge,
we're deputies.

39:05.609 --> 39:06.677
We stick together.

39:19.989 --> 39:21.558
You want some food, prisoner?

39:22.692 --> 39:25.726
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

39:25.728 --> 39:26.864
Yes, what?

39:29.265 --> 39:30.834
Yes, please.

39:37.707 --> 39:42.046
We do not reward bad manners
in this outfit.

39:44.180 --> 39:48.281
We got a big day tomorrow.
It's time to turn in.

39:48.283 --> 39:51.351
If you try any funny business
when we're sleeping,

39:51.353 --> 39:53.623
you're liable to wake up dead.

40:31.895 --> 40:33.995
Keep it moving, prisoner.

40:33.997 --> 40:36.998
Go on, you heard him.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.900
Come on.
Don't be obstinate.

40:39.902 --> 40:42.303
Hey, there's no point in
delaying the inevitable.

40:42.305 --> 40:44.038
Now, let's go.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.208
Carry you up if I have to.

40:48.911 --> 40:50.944
Shit.

40:50.946 --> 40:52.846
Jim, are you pushing?

40:52.848 --> 40:54.718
- I am.
- God.

40:55.484 --> 40:57.187
What the hell's your problem?

40:58.221 --> 40:59.886
I ain't going back.

40:59.888 --> 41:01.922
Well, that's where
you're wrong, prisoner.

41:01.924 --> 41:04.928
Yeah, you're a prisoner.
Prisoner's belong in prison.

41:05.995 --> 41:07.995
No bellyaching is
gonna change that.

41:07.997 --> 41:10.998
Now you can either
walk or you can get shot.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.266
Your choice.

41:12.268 --> 41:13.835
You gonna shoot me?

41:13.837 --> 41:15.839
- Then shoot me then.
- Eh.

41:27.517 --> 41:29.917
Why you gotta make
everything so dramatic.

41:29.919 --> 41:31.384
It's just prison.

41:31.386 --> 41:34.288
It's not like we're
talking about going to...

41:34.290 --> 41:36.223
- Massachusetts.
- Massachusetts.

41:36.225 --> 41:37.491
Oof.

41:37.493 --> 41:40.194
You ever been locked up
23 hours a day?

41:40.196 --> 41:43.130
Somebody tellin' you
what to do, when to do it?

41:43.132 --> 41:45.333
Treated like
an animal in a cage?

41:45.335 --> 41:46.967
You know what that feels like?

41:46.969 --> 41:48.870
Me personally?
No, I'm not a criminal.

41:48.872 --> 41:50.004
Yeah, we're not criminals.

41:50.006 --> 41:51.873
So, we don't know.

41:51.875 --> 41:53.908
You don't know what the
hell you talkin' 'bout then.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.842
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:55.844 --> 41:58.279
I've seen more than my
fair share of prison movies.

41:58.281 --> 42:00.047
So, I may not have
been to prison myself,

42:00.049 --> 42:01.482
but I have been
transported there

42:01.484 --> 42:03.350
through the magic
of motion pictures.

42:03.352 --> 42:06.853
I saw <i>Cool Hand Luke</i>
a couple of months back.

42:06.855 --> 42:08.522
Prison didn't seem that bad.

42:08.524 --> 42:11.458
A lot of eggs,
surprising amount of eggs.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.930
Heaven if you like eggs.

42:14.163 --> 42:17.098
The dumbest thing
I ever heard in my life.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.333
You could shoot me,
but I ain't going back.

42:19.335 --> 42:21.268
Now, you are going back.

42:21.270 --> 42:22.569
If you don't like it,

42:22.571 --> 42:24.138
well, should've thought of that

42:24.140 --> 42:25.873
before you killed
a sheriff's deputy.

42:25.875 --> 42:28.842
I ain't a killer.
Look, I'm trying to tell you.

42:28.844 --> 42:30.944
Oh, you were put in prison
for no good reason?

42:30.946 --> 42:33.080
Last time I heard, we don't
do that in America.

42:33.082 --> 42:36.083
- Man, I ain't never killed...
- All right, that's enough.

42:36.085 --> 42:37.350
Now, we're bringing you in,

42:37.352 --> 42:39.353
dead or alive.

42:39.355 --> 42:41.188
So, I'm gonna ask you
this one more time,

42:41.190 --> 42:43.924
you wanna walk or
you wanna get shot?

42:43.926 --> 42:45.426
I ain't a killer.

42:45.428 --> 42:49.029
If I was, your partner
would be dead.

42:49.031 --> 42:50.864
Well, maybe you're
a killer and a coward.

42:50.866 --> 42:52.835
I don't know.
I don't know what you're in for.

42:54.036 --> 42:56.506
In '58 I went to
a protest, Albany.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.007
Deputy came in,
arresting people.

43:01.009 --> 43:04.277
Fat ass deputy had a heart
attack trying to chase me.

43:04.279 --> 43:05.915
I ain't kill him though.

43:08.116 --> 43:10.417
Prisoner, let me
tell you something.

43:10.419 --> 43:12.386
Even if we did believe you,
which to be clear,

43:12.388 --> 43:14.522
- we do not.
- We do not.

43:14.524 --> 43:16.794
Wouldn't make a
lick of difference.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.192
Our job is to bring you in

43:19.194 --> 43:22.929
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

43:22.931 --> 43:26.067
I don't wanna kill you,
but I will.

43:26.069 --> 43:27.837
Then do it.

44:05.073 --> 44:08.277
He said if he was a killer,
your partner would be dead.

44:10.413 --> 44:12.480
And?

44:12.482 --> 44:13.851
I'm your partner.

44:15.250 --> 44:18.051
- So?
- I'm not dead.

44:18.053 --> 44:20.054
Does that preclude him
from being a killer?

44:20.056 --> 44:22.156
It's a logical fallacy.

44:22.158 --> 44:23.591
It's typical criminal behavior.

44:23.593 --> 44:25.493
Given to lies, deception...

44:25.495 --> 44:27.261
So, he is a killer?

44:27.263 --> 44:30.400
You take another step,
it's gonna be your last.

44:33.236 --> 44:36.469
What in the goddamn hell
you boys think you're doing?

44:36.471 --> 44:38.004
Getting results, sir.

44:38.006 --> 44:39.640
You do recall, don't you,

44:39.642 --> 44:41.942
that as of two days ago,
your employment

44:41.944 --> 44:43.710
with the Shandaken
sheriff's department,

44:43.712 --> 44:46.246
was terminated with cause?

44:46.248 --> 44:47.681
Yes, sir,
we just, we thought...

44:47.683 --> 44:50.350
You thought?
You thought, you thought what?

44:50.352 --> 44:54.120
You wanna get your dumb asses
locked up from two to four?

44:54.122 --> 44:56.524
We wanted to show you
we were good deputies, sir.

44:56.526 --> 44:59.259
So, we thought maybe if
we caught the prisoner,

44:59.261 --> 45:04.165
well, you'd see that and consider
giving us our jobs back.

45:04.167 --> 45:05.699
He killed one of our own, sir.

45:05.701 --> 45:07.103
No, I didn't.

45:19.314 --> 45:20.683
What'd you say?

45:23.252 --> 45:25.154
Prisoner 614?

45:35.631 --> 45:39.132
Now, you answer me
when I speak to you, boy.

45:39.134 --> 45:40.701
Yes, sir.

45:40.703 --> 45:43.337
There's a special place
in hell for your kind

45:43.339 --> 45:45.473
and if I had my way,
I'd send you there right now.

45:45.475 --> 45:47.308
Do you understand me, boy?

45:47.310 --> 45:49.377
- Yes, sir.
- You killed a deputy.

45:49.379 --> 45:51.045
I can't change that.

45:51.047 --> 45:52.545
What I can do is make sure

45:52.547 --> 45:54.482
that you pay the
consequences for your actions

45:54.484 --> 45:56.283
for the rest of your
natural born life

45:56.285 --> 45:58.551
and I promise as long
as I'm standing here,

45:58.553 --> 46:00.089
I'm gonna live up to that.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.360
I ain't killed nobody.

46:15.038 --> 46:17.138
Say it again.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.642
I ain't kill nobody.

46:20.243 --> 46:21.378
Say it again!

46:24.413 --> 46:26.283
I ain't
kill nobody, sir.

46:31.219 --> 46:35.089
Maybe we got a
bit off track, sir.

46:35.091 --> 46:39.092
Uh, um...

46:39.094 --> 46:40.363
maybe.

46:45.701 --> 46:48.138
Like I told you,
you broke the law.

46:52.642 --> 46:54.377
You also showed some gumption.

46:56.712 --> 46:58.745
- -We just did
what we thought was right, sir.

46:58.747 --> 47:00.346
He killed one of our own, sir.

47:00.348 --> 47:02.817
We're not gonna let
him get away with that.

47:02.819 --> 47:06.023
Well, I don't know.

47:07.756 --> 47:10.159
It's possible I was
wrong about you two.

47:11.227 --> 47:12.328
I'll tell you what.

47:14.129 --> 47:16.330
From this moment forward,

47:16.332 --> 47:18.766
I'm gonna deputize you two
as officers of the law.

47:18.768 --> 47:21.569
You get that son of a bitch
back to Shandaken office,

47:21.571 --> 47:24.804
you get him ready for transport,
you got your jobs back.

47:24.806 --> 47:27.408
Yes, sir,
we will not disappoint you.

47:27.410 --> 47:29.777
Oh, you sure won't disappoint,
'cause if you do,

47:29.779 --> 47:31.645
you're gonna end up with your
little pal here up north.

47:31.647 --> 47:32.745
You understand?

47:32.747 --> 47:34.817
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

47:35.852 --> 47:37.518
Should we get a move on then?

47:37.520 --> 47:39.853
Not we, you.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.187
Four hours with
this son of a bitch,

47:41.189 --> 47:42.656
I'd send him to an early grave

47:42.658 --> 47:44.728
and he'd be getting
off easy at that.

47:46.796 --> 47:50.431
Now, look, I want you to rely on
your training. I want you vigilant.

47:50.433 --> 47:53.667
This son of a bitch killed
a deputy in cold blood

47:53.669 --> 47:56.469
and don't think he
won't try it again.

47:56.471 --> 47:57.638
Don't forget that.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.306
- Yes, sir.
- We won't.

48:05.580 --> 48:08.616
Oh, yes.

48:08.618 --> 48:11.284
Yes, yes, yes.

48:11.286 --> 48:15.091
That could not
have gone any better.

48:19.794 --> 48:22.531
For some of us, it did.

49:01.803 --> 49:04.904
How did you know this
was all gonna work out?

49:04.906 --> 49:07.341
Well,
I'll tell you, Jim.

49:07.343 --> 49:08.775
No other reason
than the simple fact

49:08.777 --> 49:10.911
that it had to work out.

49:10.913 --> 49:12.580
We're deputies.

49:12.582 --> 49:14.484
You can't just take
that away from us.

49:15.718 --> 49:17.784
What if it didn't?

49:17.786 --> 49:21.254
Never even
considered that possibility.

49:21.256 --> 49:22.656
You?

49:22.658 --> 49:25.525
- I like animals.
- Okay.

49:25.527 --> 49:27.661
So, I figured
I'd probably end up

49:27.663 --> 49:30.634
in the fur business,
be a trapper.

49:31.866 --> 49:34.171
When's the last time
you saw a marker?

49:34.937 --> 49:36.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:40.676 --> 49:42.710
I don't know.
I've been following you.

49:42.712 --> 49:44.347
I've been following him.

49:45.413 --> 49:46.714
The...

49:46.716 --> 49:48.482
Why would you
follow the prisoner?

49:48.484 --> 49:51.384
- He's in front.
- Hey, prisoner.

49:51.386 --> 49:53.786
If you don't want people to
treat you like a criminal,

49:53.788 --> 49:56.522
- then maybe you should stop acting like one.
- I've just been going down.

49:56.524 --> 49:58.625
Then how come we were just
going up a few minutes back?

49:58.627 --> 49:59.792
- Yeah?
- I don't know.

49:59.794 --> 50:02.429
I didn't make the mountain.

50:02.431 --> 50:04.964
You're making a
mountain out of a molehill

50:04.966 --> 50:06.734
with your attitude
about all this.

50:06.736 --> 50:08.801
Well, we can't be
that far off the trail.

50:08.803 --> 50:11.371
Look at the map.
What's it say?

50:11.373 --> 50:13.375
Here, hold that.

50:29.325 --> 50:30.460
Yeah,

50:32.328 --> 50:35.029
we just keep going down.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.464
- Going down?
- That's what it says.

50:37.466 --> 50:39.433
- You sure?
- Yep.

50:39.435 --> 50:41.304
Yeah, that'll get us
to the bottom.

50:43.038 --> 50:45.638
You heard the man, prisoner.
Lead the way,

50:45.640 --> 50:47.343
but follow us.

50:50.879 --> 50:52.281
Going down felt right.

51:03.426 --> 51:04.792
Hello.

51:04.794 --> 51:06.726
You from the paper?

51:06.728 --> 51:08.761
Guilty as charged.

51:08.763 --> 51:10.330
That some sort
of dogshit joke,

51:10.332 --> 51:12.535
or you got something
you wanna confess?

51:13.602 --> 51:15.335
No, sir.

51:15.337 --> 51:16.536
Just a bad joke.

51:16.538 --> 51:17.971
You sure?

51:17.973 --> 51:20.641
Nothing you wanna
get off your chest?

51:20.643 --> 51:21.778
No, sir.

51:24.913 --> 51:28.582
Fine, then have a seat,
make yourself comfortable.

51:28.584 --> 51:30.417
Boys'll be back any minute.

51:30.419 --> 51:33.422
Oh, I'd prefer to stand
if it's all the same.

52:01.817 --> 52:04.585
Sir, I was told that the
deputies would be available

52:04.587 --> 52:06.420
any time after two o'clock.

52:06.422 --> 52:08.087
Mm-hmm.

52:08.089 --> 52:11.894
Well, it's nearly
4:30 now, sir.

52:12.995 --> 52:14.728
Mmm.

52:14.730 --> 52:16.333
They'll be back any minute.

52:19.667 --> 52:22.169
Maybe I could just
come back tomorrow.

52:24.073 --> 52:25.806
You know, about four
or five years ago,

52:25.808 --> 52:27.607
there was this big case
down in Kingston.

52:27.609 --> 52:29.009
Maybe you remember about it.

52:29.011 --> 52:31.578
Couple Italian boys
come up from New York City,

52:31.580 --> 52:34.781
shot a man dead on the
county courthouse steps,

52:34.783 --> 52:37.618
got him right between
the eyes, broad daylight.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.051
Yes, sir.

52:39.053 --> 52:42.054
I seem to recall
hearing about that.

52:42.056 --> 52:45.893
Mm-hmm. Anyway, there was
this young photographer,

52:45.895 --> 52:49.129
some paper or another.
I don't know.

52:49.131 --> 52:50.998
And he was working
the courthouse that day

52:51.000 --> 52:52.466
and he hears the gunfight,

52:52.468 --> 52:54.167
he comes out,
he starts taking pictures.

52:54.169 --> 52:57.170
Now the wops, they didn't
take too kindly to that,

52:57.172 --> 52:58.638
you know?

52:58.640 --> 53:00.973
So, before they took off,
they beat him

53:00.975 --> 53:02.611
within an inch of his life,

53:04.145 --> 53:07.714
used his own camera to do it.

53:07.716 --> 53:11.851
I'm sorry, sir. I don't quite
follow what you're saying.

53:11.853 --> 53:13.719
So, I happened to be at
the courthouse that day

53:13.721 --> 53:16.690
and, I mean, actually, I was
the first one at the scene

53:16.692 --> 53:18.491
and Jesus, it was an awful mess.

53:18.493 --> 53:20.460
I mean, there was
a man dead on the ground,

53:20.462 --> 53:24.464
another man pleading
for his life.

53:24.466 --> 53:27.634
But all this happened toward
the end of the day, you know?

53:27.636 --> 53:29.236
And I remember saying to myself,

53:29.238 --> 53:31.540
"Maybe I can come
back tomorrow."

53:34.042 --> 53:35.978
But I couldn't do that,
now could I?

53:37.779 --> 53:39.815
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

53:40.950 --> 53:42.748
See, 'cause in my line of work,

53:42.750 --> 53:45.786
you come back tomorrow,
that poor photographer,

53:45.788 --> 53:49.755
not unlike yourself,
he's gonna bleed out and die

53:49.757 --> 53:52.728
right in front of a growing
number of women and children.

53:54.497 --> 53:56.598
You see where
I'm going with this, son?

53:57.866 --> 53:59.968
Yes, sir.

54:01.703 --> 54:03.472
Good.

54:04.739 --> 54:07.774
So, you just make
yourself comfortable.

54:07.776 --> 54:11.047
And those boys'll
be back any minute.

54:22.991 --> 54:24.824
Ah, nothing.

54:26.027 --> 54:27.828
Why's huntin' so hard?

54:27.830 --> 54:29.730
Where's all the meat?

54:29.732 --> 54:31.868
Should set up camp
before nightfall.

54:33.035 --> 54:34.534
I want dinner first.

54:34.536 --> 54:36.670
- I'm hungry.
- Well, truth be told,

54:36.672 --> 54:39.005
we can survive on
water alone for weeks.

54:39.007 --> 54:40.973
Not me.
I need solids.

54:40.975 --> 54:42.975
You can eat some of
the plants up here.

54:42.977 --> 54:45.681
Yes, obviously we know that.

54:48.817 --> 54:50.884
What you got? Is this...
Yeah, looks good.

54:50.886 --> 54:52.489
Uh-huh.

54:59.727 --> 55:00.794
What if he poisoned it?

55:00.796 --> 55:03.029
Shit.

55:03.031 --> 55:05.832
Prisoner, if you poisoned us,
you have to tell me.

55:05.834 --> 55:07.801
I'm emetophobic.

55:07.803 --> 55:10.636
That means I have a
pathological fear of vomit.

55:10.638 --> 55:11.971
It's wild chicory.

55:11.973 --> 55:15.808
Trickery or not,
did you poison us?

55:15.810 --> 55:20.313
I didn't, but I should have.

55:20.315 --> 55:23.016
That isn't very nice,
prisoner.

55:23.018 --> 55:24.183
I hope you didn't mean that.

55:24.185 --> 55:25.685
All right, enough talk.

55:25.687 --> 55:27.620
We gotta set up camp
before nightfall.

55:27.622 --> 55:29.989
Come on, time to move.

55:29.991 --> 55:31.058
Let's go.

55:31.060 --> 55:33.125
- Deputies.
- Huh?

55:33.127 --> 55:34.661
Deputy.

55:34.663 --> 55:35.998
Jim.

55:40.268 --> 55:42.368
You see him?

55:42.370 --> 55:44.770
All right, go ahead, Jim.

55:44.772 --> 55:46.008
Take the shot.

55:58.654 --> 55:59.889
Jim?

56:01.991 --> 56:04.123
I can't.

56:04.125 --> 56:06.058
I can't.

56:06.060 --> 56:08.094
Fine.

56:19.341 --> 56:20.373
He smiled at me.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.341
See?
He's precocious.

56:22.343 --> 56:24.243
I didn't know
they could do that.

56:24.245 --> 56:25.879
Yeah.

56:25.881 --> 56:27.813
I can't do it.

56:27.815 --> 56:28.951
What?

56:37.026 --> 56:38.658
You shoot.

56:38.660 --> 56:39.761
No way.

56:41.797 --> 56:43.263
You killed before.

56:43.265 --> 56:46.098
You already have
a thirst for blood.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.100
I can't do it.

56:48.102 --> 56:50.170
Oh, so you got no problem
killing a sheriff's deputy,

56:50.172 --> 56:52.938
but all of a sudden
you're too morally scrupulous

56:52.940 --> 56:55.708
- to kill a turkey?
- I am not a killer.

56:55.710 --> 56:58.210
Oh, come on, prisoner. You
know, you can keep saying that

56:58.212 --> 56:59.712
until you're red in the face.

56:59.714 --> 57:01.147
The point is you had
your day in court

57:01.149 --> 57:03.350
and the jury decided otherwise.

57:03.352 --> 57:06.420
Yeah, seven white men
and five white women.

57:06.422 --> 57:08.321
Took 'em a whole 10 minutes.

57:08.323 --> 57:12.091
You're saying that five women
aren't fit to be jurors.

57:12.093 --> 57:14.728
That's sexist and
we won't stand for it.

57:14.730 --> 57:17.964
Look, prisoner, if you got
complaints about your trial,

57:17.966 --> 57:19.699
take it up with the courts.

57:19.701 --> 57:21.100
We got a lot riding on
bringing you back in

57:21.102 --> 57:23.036
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

57:23.038 --> 57:25.172
Now how pleasant of
an experience that is,

57:25.174 --> 57:27.708
well, that's entirely up to you.

57:27.710 --> 57:29.912
Yeah, so you'll
really give me a gun?

57:32.346 --> 57:34.147
I wanna eat turkey.

57:34.149 --> 57:35.284
Yep.

58:04.747 --> 58:07.716
Deputy, go to sleep.

58:09.250 --> 58:10.953
I can't.

58:12.888 --> 58:17.991
You think it was
painful when he died?

58:17.993 --> 58:21.895
Can't imagine a heart
attack feels very good.

58:21.897 --> 58:23.496
Not the deputy.

58:23.498 --> 58:25.000
Talking about the turkey.

58:28.236 --> 58:29.469
You killed a sheriff's deputy.

58:29.471 --> 58:31.804
You're worried about
a goddamn turkey?

58:31.806 --> 58:33.440
I didn't kill the deputy.

58:33.442 --> 58:36.208
Too many donuts
killed the deputy.

58:36.210 --> 58:37.844
I killed the turkey.

58:37.846 --> 58:40.717
Mm-hmm, and I'm very thankful.

58:41.884 --> 58:44.083
Listen to me carefully,
prisoner.

58:44.085 --> 58:47.790
Need you to shut your
mouth and go to bed.

58:57.899 --> 58:59.000
Deputy.

59:00.535 --> 59:03.069
- Deputy.
- What?

59:03.071 --> 59:04.904
Gotta go outside.

59:04.906 --> 59:07.040
No, you don't.

59:07.042 --> 59:08.310
I'm about to be sick.

59:09.844 --> 59:13.013
Uh-uh, no, you can't be sick.

59:13.015 --> 59:14.580
You can't be sick in the tent.

59:14.582 --> 59:16.149
Jim, you gotta take him out.

59:16.151 --> 59:17.951
I can't, I can't,
I can't take him.

59:17.953 --> 59:20.554
I can't be around him.
Get him out, get him out.

59:20.556 --> 59:22.188
It's your turn, Jim.

59:22.190 --> 59:24.292
I've been cuffed to him
for the past two nights.

59:26.127 --> 59:29.196
I can't, I can't, uh,

59:29.198 --> 59:31.531
take his cuffs off and we'll
just watch him from here.

59:31.533 --> 59:32.866
Take his cuffs off him?

59:32.868 --> 59:34.333
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

59:34.335 --> 59:36.435
We can watch him from here.
You take him.

59:36.437 --> 59:37.603
Uh.

59:37.605 --> 59:39.339
All right, all right,
all right.

59:39.341 --> 59:43.176
Prisoner, if we uncuff you,
you gonna try to escape?

59:43.178 --> 59:47.112
You promise? Remember, I
don't chase, I shoot.

59:47.114 --> 59:48.515
You hear me?

59:48.517 --> 59:50.016
Now, say you promise.

59:50.018 --> 59:52.219
I promise.

59:52.221 --> 59:53.987
Ah.

59:53.989 --> 59:56.890
Give me your hand.

59:56.892 --> 59:59.525
I can't believe I'm doing
this stupid ass, goddamn it.

59:59.527 --> 01:00:01.328
Letting you go, 'cause
you're feeling lousy.

01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:12.408
Uh, I think I hear.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:16.212
Stay
where we can see you.

01:00:24.919 --> 01:00:26.188
Still there?

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:29.357
Still here, deputy.

01:00:33.328 --> 01:00:35.230
What if he's
telling the truth?

01:00:36.598 --> 01:00:37.998
The judge didn't
seem to think so.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.531
That's all that matters.

01:00:39.533 --> 01:00:41.400
Still there?

01:00:41.402 --> 01:00:45.038
Still here.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.910
I don't know if he's a killer.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:53.048
Now, Jim, how many
killers you know?

01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:56.449
None.

01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:57.987
Exactly.

01:00:59.988 --> 01:01:02.321
Mmm, I see him.

01:01:02.323 --> 01:01:03.859
Yep.

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:23.009
You got lookout for a bit?

01:01:23.011 --> 01:01:25.181
We both on lookout.

01:01:27.114 --> 01:01:30.317
But I only ate dark meat.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.954
So?

01:01:48.703 --> 01:01:50.038
Still there?

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.643
Still here.

01:02:17.265 --> 01:02:18.701
Deputy.

01:03:15.122 --> 01:03:16.755
- Shit!
- Huh?

01:03:16.757 --> 01:03:18.792
What?
Oh, prisoner.

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:21.060
Oh, shit.

01:03:21.062 --> 01:03:22.795
Prisoner!

01:03:22.797 --> 01:03:24.232
Prisoner!

01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:26.433
Come on out.

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:28.167
Shit.

01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:29.736
Where is he?

01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:31.140
He escaped.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.243
Shit.
Oh, shit.

01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:43.850
Shit, shit,
we're going to prison.

01:03:43.852 --> 01:03:45.618
- No, we ain't.
- We're going to prison.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.120
- Jim.
- Thurman, you heard the sheriff.

01:03:48.122 --> 01:03:49.788
- All right, that's enough.
- Sheriff said if we don't bring the...

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:51.824
Just stop it, Jim.

01:03:51.826 --> 01:03:53.161
Goddamn it.

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:58.797
Ah.

01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:00.699
Oh, oh my god.

01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:02.134
That feels so good.

01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:03.803
Why does that help so much?

01:04:06.507 --> 01:04:08.540
Yeah.

01:04:09.743 --> 01:04:11.611
Shit.

01:04:11.613 --> 01:04:13.179
Help!

01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:14.746
Don't shoot!

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:15.848
Yeah.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:18.451
Yeah.

01:04:18.453 --> 01:04:20.886
- Help!
- Uh, I'm out.

01:04:20.888 --> 01:04:22.654
- Did you hear that?
- Don't shoot.

01:04:22.656 --> 01:04:24.556
Prisoner, is that you?

01:04:24.558 --> 01:04:27.226
Uh, prisoner?

01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:28.497
Help!

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:41.674
Well, well, well, looks like
we caught ourselves a killer,

01:04:41.676 --> 01:04:44.210
- again.
- Uh-huh.

01:04:44.212 --> 01:04:47.614
- I got lost.
- Uh-huh.

01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:49.248
Listen, prisoner,

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.150
I don't know how they do
things down in prison,

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:54.219
but where we come from,
in the law-abiding community,

01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:56.455
a man's word means something.

01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:59.359
- Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have trusted a prisoner.
- Huh?

01:04:59.361 --> 01:05:01.393
Well, maybe it's our fault.

01:05:01.395 --> 01:05:03.629
You shouldn't have
trusted a prisoner.

01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:07.433
I shouldn't have trusted a prisoner.
It was your idea to let him go.

01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:08.835
- No, I...
- You said, "We think we can trust him,"

01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:10.435
'cause you didn't wanna
go outside with him.

01:05:10.437 --> 01:05:11.937
- He was getting sick.
- 'Cause you were starting

01:05:11.939 --> 01:05:13.505
to get scared of him
getting sick.

01:05:13.507 --> 01:05:14.940
- No, I wasn't scared.
- My exact words were,

01:05:14.942 --> 01:05:16.542
"Are you out of
your goddamn mind".

01:05:16.544 --> 01:05:18.810
If he starts retching,
then I'll start retching.

01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:21.681
Jim, it doesn't matter, Jim. The point
is he's a criminal and a killer

01:05:21.683 --> 01:05:23.786
- and we gotta start treating him like one.
- I'm not a killer.

01:05:26.587 --> 01:05:28.453
Listen, prisoner, if you're
so sure you're innocent,

01:05:28.455 --> 01:05:30.255
why don't you appeal
to the courts?

01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:31.391
That's not our business.

01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:33.129
I tried that.

01:05:34.428 --> 01:05:36.131
No lawyer would take my case.

01:05:37.399 --> 01:05:39.301
So what, you just give up?

01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:42.669
- Typical.
- Typical.

01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:45.370
No, not really.
I went to the prison law library

01:05:45.372 --> 01:05:48.341
to research my case
so I can get some appeal,

01:05:48.343 --> 01:05:50.810
but judge denied it.

01:05:50.812 --> 01:05:53.482
Said I'm lucky I'm not
hanging from a tree.

01:05:58.652 --> 01:06:00.687
I think he's just
trying paint himself

01:06:00.689 --> 01:06:03.422
- as a sympathetic character.
- Yeah.

01:06:03.424 --> 01:06:05.391
So, we feel comfortable,
we let our guard down.

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:07.292
But he can't be trusted.
He's proven that much.

01:06:07.294 --> 01:06:09.531
Yeah.

01:06:11.966 --> 01:06:14.569
What you got?

01:06:16.437 --> 01:06:17.469
What is it?

01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:18.607
Read it.

01:06:20.442 --> 01:06:24.243
We'll read it in our own time.

01:06:24.245 --> 01:06:26.581
It's a newspaper article.

01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:38.627
What if he is innocent?

01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:44.330
Still don't change anything.

01:06:44.332 --> 01:06:45.632
Still gotta take him in.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.033
- Yeah.
- No, you don't.

01:06:47.035 --> 01:06:49.738
Yeah, we do. Sit still,
I'm gonna cut you down.

01:06:51.538 --> 01:06:52.874
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:54.408 --> 01:06:57.377
Prisoner, from
that vantage point,

01:06:57.379 --> 01:07:00.449
can you see any trail markers?

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.488
Nope.

01:07:09.623 --> 01:07:11.357
Can you really not see any

01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:14.060
or are you just
delaying the inevitable?

01:07:14.062 --> 01:07:15.730
I don't see any.

01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:19.668
Prisoner,

01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:22.504
I wanna propose a truce.

01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:25.774
You help us get
back to the path,

01:07:26.808 --> 01:07:28.444
and you change your attitude,

01:07:29.611 --> 01:07:31.844
when we get back there,

01:07:31.846 --> 01:07:36.748
I promise we'll talk
to the sheriff

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.851
and, you know,
we'll make him aware

01:07:39.853 --> 01:07:45.261
of, you know, your unique
peculiarities of your case.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.627
Same sheriff I saw earlier?

01:07:47.629 --> 01:07:48.861
There's only one sheriff.

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:50.629
No deal.

01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:52.834
Prisoner, that's as good
a deal as you're gonna get.

01:07:57.105 --> 01:07:58.507
Please?

01:08:02.977 --> 01:08:04.676
Hold on.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.759
I really should
be going, sheriff.

01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:25.634
I got a family, sir.
Please.

01:08:27.836 --> 01:08:30.969
If you wanna leave,

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.042
prior to you completing your
professional set of duties,

01:08:35.844 --> 01:08:38.314
I guess that's what
you're gonna have to do.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:43.015
So am I free to go?

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:46.752
Of course, of course.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:49.821
But you know, every choice
does have it's consequences.

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:52.725
You're just gonna
have to ask yourself

01:08:52.727 --> 01:08:55.828
are you prepared to live
with the ramifications

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.399
of your actions.

01:09:01.502 --> 01:09:02.837
Smoke?

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.103
Hey, Darlene.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.906
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a state-wide APB

01:09:40.908 --> 01:09:42.874
on deputies Hayford and Doyle

01:09:42.876 --> 01:09:46.011
and Adirondack County
Correctional prisoner 614.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.783
That's right, dead or alive.

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:56.457
Hey, Darlene.
10-22, cancel that.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.694
You're late.

01:10:01.696 --> 01:10:02.994
Yes, sir.

01:10:02.996 --> 01:10:05.133
We're awful sorry.
We got lost.

01:10:08.603 --> 01:10:10.837
You see that man out there?

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.737
That man's gonna make
heroes of you boys.

01:10:12.739 --> 01:10:15.908
Actually, sir, we was hoping
we could talk for a second.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:19.712
Well, it's gonna have to wait.
Follow me.

01:10:19.714 --> 01:10:22.181
We're gonna get them ugly faces
in every goddamn newspaper

01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:23.519
from here to Albany.

01:10:26.854 --> 01:10:29.489
Okay, Thurman,
let's put you over here.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.123
Jim, why don't you stand there?

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:33.996
And let's put the
prisoner right there.

01:10:40.535 --> 01:10:43.102
This is a great service
to the department

01:10:43.104 --> 01:10:45.771
and to the fine
citizens of Shandaken.

01:10:45.773 --> 01:10:49.711
You relied on training, you
showed great bravery and heart.

01:10:51.179 --> 01:10:54.513
And so, by the
power vested in me

01:10:54.515 --> 01:10:57.016
by the great state of New York,

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:58.587
you are hereby reinstated.

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:00.856
Deputies.

01:11:02.023 --> 01:11:03.623
Thank you, sheriff.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.290
Thank you, sir.

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:06.527
Okay.

01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:14.200
Okay, and smile.

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:18.870
I think we're all finished here.

01:11:18.872 --> 01:11:22.775
Um, sir, am I free to go?

01:11:22.777 --> 01:11:24.543
You are free to go, citizen.

01:11:24.545 --> 01:11:26.547
Thank you very much
for your service.

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.084
You boys ever keep me
waiting again,

01:11:32.086 --> 01:11:34.052
I'm gonna take them
badges away for good.

01:11:34.054 --> 01:11:36.021
I'll be back at 0700.

01:11:36.023 --> 01:11:37.557
I'm gonna take this son of
a bitch up north myself.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.691
Understood?

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:39.959
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:41.063
Good.

01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:45.765
Sir, we was hoping
we could talk to you

01:11:45.767 --> 01:11:47.001
about something first.

01:11:51.205 --> 01:11:55.207
You see, we become aware
of some peculiarities

01:11:55.209 --> 01:11:57.746
in the prisoner's case.

01:11:59.346 --> 01:12:00.879
Such as?

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:03.249
Well, sir, such as,
the way he tells it,

01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:04.850
he run from a
deputy at a protest

01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:07.652
and the deputy died
of a heart attack

01:12:07.654 --> 01:12:10.188
while he was in pursuit.
That's it.

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.792
They booked him on
felony murder, sir.

01:12:12.794 --> 01:12:14.360
Life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

01:12:14.362 --> 01:12:17.329
I mean, if
prisoner 614 believes

01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:19.332
that he did not
receive a fair trial,

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.834
then he's got recourse
within the legal system.

01:12:21.836 --> 01:12:23.268
It is not our per view.

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:25.137
Courts won't hear his appeal.

01:12:25.139 --> 01:12:30.176
It seems there's racial
stuff going on, you know,

01:12:30.178 --> 01:12:33.782
with him being of
negro persuasion.

01:12:43.056 --> 01:12:46.392
"8/14/58, 1:34 p.m.

01:12:46.394 --> 01:12:48.360
"Albany sheriff's deputies
McCoy and Sullivan

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:51.364
"responded to a request for
backup from university PD.

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:53.899
"Deputies arrived
on scene at 1:42 p.m.,

01:12:53.901 --> 01:12:56.168
"began placing
trespassers under arrest.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:58.637
"A negro male, age 20, 25 years,

01:12:58.639 --> 01:13:00.806
"disregarded orders
and fled on foot.

01:13:00.808 --> 01:13:03.709
"Deputy McCoy ordered the suspect
to stop and gave choice.

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:09.248
"Deputy McCoy collapsed while
in pursuit of the suspect.

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:13.084
"and was pronounced DOA at 2:04
p.m. at Pine Ridge Hospital.

01:13:13.086 --> 01:13:16.155
"Suspect was apprehended
by deputy Sullivan,

01:13:16.157 --> 01:13:20.328
"booked, and transported
to holding at 2:27 p.m."

01:13:21.862 --> 01:13:23.262
You see, sir,
he was being honest.

01:13:23.264 --> 01:13:24.632
He ain't kill nobody.

01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:30.168
That criminal resisted arrest.

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:34.440
And as a result of his crime,
a sheriff's deputy is dead.

01:13:34.442 --> 01:13:39.678
Yes, sir, but that deputy,
God rest his soul,

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.079
he was a very obese man.

01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:44.016
Well, that his
God-given, American right.

01:13:44.018 --> 01:13:47.255
That son of a bitch
killed one of our own!

01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:50.222
Now, if you guys
can't understand that,

01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:53.028
then sure as shit, you shouldn't
be wearing them badges.

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:56.164
I'm gonna say this one time.

01:13:58.965 --> 01:14:00.266
We got a problem?

01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:01.866
No, sir.

01:14:01.868 --> 01:14:03.334
Prisoner 614 will
remain in our custody

01:14:03.336 --> 01:14:04.969
until 0700 tomorrow,

01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:06.204
at which point
we'll surrender him over

01:14:06.206 --> 01:14:07.375
to you for transport.

01:14:10.344 --> 01:14:11.647
Yes, sir.

01:14:13.814 --> 01:14:15.416
Good.

01:14:39.273 --> 01:14:42.874
Two congratulatory London
broil dinners on the house

01:14:42.876 --> 01:14:49.214
for the deputies and
meatloaf for the new guy.

01:14:49.216 --> 01:14:52.250
- Full price.
- Mmm, where are my manners?

01:14:52.252 --> 01:14:54.152
Marla, this is prisoner 614.

01:14:54.154 --> 01:14:55.756
Prisoner, Marla.

01:14:57.157 --> 01:14:59.091
Is that a nickname
or something?

01:14:59.093 --> 01:15:00.228
'Fraid not.

01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:05.200
I need to use the washroom.

01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:16.976
What the hell is
wrong with you guys,

01:15:16.978 --> 01:15:19.043
bringing a dangerous
criminal here?

01:15:19.045 --> 01:15:21.248
You're gonna scare
off all the customers.

01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:24.048
Don't worry, Marla.
He's innocent.

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:25.851
You told me he was
a cold-blooded killer.

01:15:25.853 --> 01:15:27.253
Only technically.

01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:29.888
He was running from
a deputy at a protest

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.423
and the deputy chased him
and had a heart attack

01:15:31.425 --> 01:15:34.730
and the court sentenced
him to life in prison.

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.896
For running?

01:15:37.898 --> 01:15:38.999
Resisting arrest.

01:15:43.069 --> 01:15:44.371
So, what are we gonna do?

01:15:47.407 --> 01:15:50.843
He's gotta be back up
here at 0700 tomorrow.

01:15:50.845 --> 01:15:53.145
Until then we're...

01:15:53.147 --> 01:15:54.916
That's it?

01:16:00.487 --> 01:16:02.922
Well, like Dr. King said,

01:16:02.924 --> 01:16:06.261
"Injustice anywhere is a
threat to justice everywhere."

01:16:08.295 --> 01:16:09.962
Where'd you hear that?

01:16:09.964 --> 01:16:12.231
Oh, I catered a
Black Panther luncheon

01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:14.266
a few months ago in Woodstock.

01:16:14.268 --> 01:16:16.067
I read it in a pamphlet.

01:16:16.069 --> 01:16:18.036
Very nice people.

01:16:18.038 --> 01:16:20.472
Good tippers too.

01:16:22.242 --> 01:16:23.812
She's right, Thurman.

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:27.111
I know.

01:16:27.113 --> 01:16:29.785
Is the sheriff
doing transport?

01:16:31.484 --> 01:16:33.218
How'd you know that?

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:37.923
Well, every other Tuesday,
he comes by here

01:16:37.925 --> 01:16:41.259
on his way to the courthouse,
like clockwork.

01:16:41.261 --> 01:16:44.230
He orders a black coffee
with eight sugars.

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.932
It's hard to forget
an order like that.

01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:48.299
Eight sugars?

01:16:48.301 --> 01:16:50.471
Yeah, it's like he
never heard of diabetes.

01:16:51.872 --> 01:16:53.504
Marla, let me
try one of those.

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:56.040
- What?
- A black coffee with eight sugars.

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:58.142
Are you out of your mind?

01:16:58.144 --> 01:17:00.913
Diabetes puts you at a
risk for heart disease...

01:17:00.915 --> 01:17:03.385
Marla, I get it, but
can I try one please?

01:17:30.544 --> 01:17:32.578
That's pretty good.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.948
Pass it down.

01:17:39.386 --> 01:17:42.221
Can't taste nothing,
but sugar.

01:17:42.223 --> 01:17:43.524
Exactly.

01:17:57.037 --> 01:17:58.339
It's time.

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:34.442
- Morning, sheriff.
- I'd say it is.

01:18:37.243 --> 01:18:39.210
It's all over the papers.

01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:41.049
You boys are bonafide heroes.

01:18:44.117 --> 01:18:45.185
On your feet, boy.

01:18:55.362 --> 01:18:59.533
You know, there's a
certain kind of irony

01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:05.639
in locking away a man for life.

01:19:06.674 --> 01:19:08.507
You hear me, boy?

01:19:08.509 --> 01:19:10.008
Yes, sir.

01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:12.710
I said, there's
a kind of irony

01:19:12.712 --> 01:19:16.382
- in locking away a man for life.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:20.785
I mean, if a man thinks
he's gonna get out, right,

01:19:20.787 --> 01:19:24.123
be it one year, 50 years, right,

01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:27.625
it gives him hope,
it gives his life meaning

01:19:27.627 --> 01:19:31.463
and it gives the people in
charge a hell of a lot of power.

01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:33.332
'Cause it's, I mean,
you break the rules,

01:19:33.334 --> 01:19:35.267
you're just gonna spend
more time behind bars.

01:19:35.269 --> 01:19:36.671
It's as simple as that.

01:19:40.073 --> 01:19:42.242
But you lock away
a man for life,

01:19:44.644 --> 01:19:46.413
such as is your case,

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:51.650
well, that man,
he might start to thinking

01:19:51.652 --> 01:19:55.721
he's got nothing left to lose,

01:19:55.723 --> 01:19:58.193
that the rules
no longer apply to him.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.160
I mean, after all,
you can't add time

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:04.064
to a life sentence.

01:20:05.698 --> 01:20:07.434
You starting to see the irony?

01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:10.268
Yes, sir.

01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:11.538
Good.

01:20:14.207 --> 01:20:18.545
Fortunately, I've found,
as long as he's breathing,

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.149
every man's got
something to lose.

01:20:23.317 --> 01:20:25.284
Some of them just
might need reminding

01:20:25.286 --> 01:20:27.422
a little bit more
forcefully than others.

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:32.591
Keep that in mind,
should you ever start

01:20:32.593 --> 01:20:35.229
thinking about escaping again.

01:20:56.349 --> 01:20:57.516
Don't move.

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.146
Good morning, sheriff.

01:21:28.148 --> 01:21:30.084
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

01:21:37.858 --> 01:21:39.158
Hurry it up, will ya?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.562
I got a prisoner in transport.

01:21:46.233 --> 01:21:47.298
What can I get for you?

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.432
Coffee to go.

01:21:48.434 --> 01:21:50.902
Black coffee, eight sugars.

01:21:50.904 --> 01:21:52.206
Just black.

01:21:53.373 --> 01:21:54.906
No sugars?

01:21:54.908 --> 01:21:56.909
My goddamn wife's been
pestering me about it,

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.378
thinks I'm gonna get diabetes.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.878
From sugar?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.681
Oh, I don't think one thing
has to do with the other.

01:22:02.683 --> 01:22:05.787
- Just pour the goddamn coffee.
- All right.

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:12.192
She'd take medical advice
from a goddamn chimpanzee.

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:47.895
Black coffee, no sugars.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.602
Eight sugars.

01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:57.602
I beg your pardon, sir.

01:22:57.604 --> 01:22:59.737
Put eight goddamn
sugars in there

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:01.373
and don't make me ask you again.

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:03.408
It tastes like shit without it.

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:06.346
Fine, but use your manners.

01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:11.953
Put eight goddamn
sugars in there, please.

01:23:38.778 --> 01:23:41.045
It's on the house, I presume.

01:23:41.047 --> 01:23:42.813
Yes, sir.

01:23:42.815 --> 01:23:45.486
Give me one of them
apple fritters too.

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:37.102
You better take it
all in, prisoner.

01:24:37.104 --> 01:24:38.936
The next time you're
gonna see the outside,

01:24:38.938 --> 01:24:41.673
they're gonna be throwing
dirt on your casket.

01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:56.924
Well, no turning back now.

01:26:04.157 --> 01:26:07.627
Prisoner, I'm gonna
confiscate your cigarettes.

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:42.694
Show me your hands.

01:26:45.832 --> 01:26:47.067
Get out.

01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:53.006
Get out!

01:27:00.581 --> 01:27:03.651
I don't wanna soil the
interior of my car, but I will.

01:27:21.134 --> 01:27:22.636
Move, move.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.763
Something ain't right.

01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:46.019
On your knees, boy.

01:29:01.734 --> 01:29:03.701
Time to make your peace.

01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:05.637
You don't have to do this.

01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:10.678
Boy, you're about to find
out just how wrong you are.

01:29:16.983 --> 01:29:19.049
This here's justice.

01:29:20.854 --> 01:29:23.858
Ain't no justice in executing
an innocent man, sheriff.

01:29:25.992 --> 01:29:27.225
What the hell you doing?

01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:28.729
Just doing what's right, sir.

01:29:32.165 --> 01:29:34.231
You traitorous
sons of bitches.

01:29:34.233 --> 01:29:36.834
You just made the biggest
mistake of your goddamn lives.

01:29:36.836 --> 01:29:39.272
Well, sir, obviously,
we see it differently.

01:29:40.407 --> 01:29:41.809
You're dead...

01:29:42.943 --> 01:29:44.109
and you're dead.

01:29:44.111 --> 01:29:45.677
You are dead!

01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:46.814
You...

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:53.118
Uh, is he retching?

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.919
Thurman is he, is he sick?

01:29:58.257 --> 01:29:59.359
Sheriff?

01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:04.831
Sheriff?

01:30:08.769 --> 01:30:09.937
Sheriff?

01:30:23.349 --> 01:30:24.986
He's dead.

01:30:26.318 --> 01:30:27.787
Dead?

01:30:29.889 --> 01:30:31.358
That wasn't
supposed to happen.

01:30:32.792 --> 01:30:33.960
We killed him.

01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:40.065
Not quite, deputy.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.268
Heart attack.

01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:45.904
- How do you know?
- Yeah.

01:30:45.906 --> 01:30:47.341
Trust me, I know.

01:30:55.982 --> 01:30:58.917
Well, prisoner,

01:30:58.919 --> 01:31:01.119
I guess the good news is one day
you'll be able to look back

01:31:01.121 --> 01:31:03.987
on all this and laugh.

01:31:03.989 --> 01:31:05.723
What are the odds,
the same thing that got you

01:31:05.725 --> 01:31:08.927
into this whole mess is
what gets you out of it.

01:31:08.929 --> 01:31:10.264
Mm-hmm.

01:31:12.232 --> 01:31:14.065
We gotta go.

01:31:14.067 --> 01:31:15.435
Sir.

01:31:44.764 --> 01:31:47.265
Hey, prisoner.

01:31:47.267 --> 01:31:50.371
You can bet our relationship is
no longer adversarial in nature.

01:31:52.205 --> 01:31:53.741
You got yourself a name?

01:31:55.175 --> 01:31:57.211
My friends call me Andre.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.084
Andre, good to meet you.

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:13.258
Hey, Thurman, littering.

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.993
Who cares?

01:32:14.995 --> 01:32:16.895
We're criminals now.

01:32:16.897 --> 01:32:19.934
Doesn't mean
nature has to suffer.

01:32:22.135 --> 01:32:24.205
Right on, deputies.

01:32:26.238 --> 01:32:29.410
Yeah, just stick to the plan.

01:32:30.876 --> 01:32:32.178
The plan.

01:32:33.546 --> 01:32:35.081
Ow.

01:33:06.513 --> 01:33:10.283
Tickets.
Tickets, please.

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.188
Ticket, sir.

01:33:15.322 --> 01:33:18.222
Ticket, sir.

01:33:22.461 --> 01:33:24.128
Oh, beg your pardon.

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.065
Sorry to disturb you, deputy.

01:33:27.067 --> 01:33:28.836
Tickets!

01:34:57.389 --> 01:35:00.357
Because you're under arrest.

01:35:00.359 --> 01:35:01.629
Hey.

01:35:04.997 --> 01:35:06.132
Shit.
