00:35.827 --> 00:42.292


01:08.234 --> 01:09.527
Let's get a move on!

01:09.611 --> 01:12.072
-This family is not late for church!

01:12.155 --> 01:13.364
Give me a sec!

01:15.450 --> 01:16.701
How dare you?

01:16.785 --> 01:21.623
Where do you gather
the temerity and absolute bad manners

01:21.706 --> 01:24.459
to begin a movement to recall my husband?

01:24.542 --> 01:27.921
Trent is the very finest of gentlemen.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.258
And never ever in all of his born days
has he done anything

01:32.342 --> 01:33.843
but the very best for Serenity.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.761
Mary Vaughn--

01:34.844 --> 01:38.681
He will prevail over this clutch
of petty, vindictive hens,

01:38.765 --> 01:41.559
who are so hapless at love

01:41.643 --> 01:45.313
that they find excitement
in maligning good men.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.357
Since it's the Lord's day,

01:47.440 --> 01:48.817
I'll say only this.

01:49.359 --> 01:53.738
God bless our town founders
who ensured that when citizens disagree,

01:53.822 --> 01:55.657
there is a process put in place.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.118
We stand on the foundation that they laid.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.371
You asked me
about kicking the hornets' nest.

02:02.747 --> 02:07.669
Folks have seen the hornets swarming,
and they are waiting for an exterminator.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.548
Maddie.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.843
Let's take a deep breath…

02:14.926 --> 02:17.804
…and look at the real issue.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.976
You are worked up
over your little parking problem.

02:23.518 --> 02:28.356
I would be happy
to suggest that Town Council reexamine.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.483
Well, that would save a lot of trouble.

02:31.651 --> 02:35.029
But it's too late to stop the recall.
The people have spoken.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.657
The Declaration of Independence
has been signed.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.543
Declaration of Independence.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.919
It's nice.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.754
Dating a history teacher
is really paying off.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.141
Oh, she is so beautiful, Noreen.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.269
As I knew she would be.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.563
Rebecca.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.482
Sweet, sweet Rebecca.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.611
Rebecca Lynne Fitzgibbons.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.450
Well, uh…

03:21.534 --> 03:23.453
Lovely name for a lovely girl.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.336
Y'all can come on in.
Bill's just here checking on us.

03:33.922 --> 03:37.592
I'm Charles Fitzgibbons, Noreen's dad.
Uh, this is my wife, Amelia.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.428
Sir. An honor to meet ya.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.138
Ma'am.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.934
Well, I wish we were meeting
under slightly different circumstances,

03:46.017 --> 03:50.480
but I do want you to know that I embrace
my responsibility here, all right?

03:51.064 --> 03:54.984
Noreen and I,
we already agreed on child support,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.238
and I just took care
of the hospital charges, so…

03:58.321 --> 03:59.739
That's good to know.

03:59.822 --> 04:03.534
And anything else they need,
I'm a phone call away.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.664
Much appreciated,
but you needn't worry, Dr. Townsend.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.833
Once Noreen and the baby are home,
they'll want for nothing.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.919
When Peanut and I
are discharged tomorrow,

04:13.002 --> 04:17.048
we're just going as far as Isaac's.
I need a day or two to regroup.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.342
I'll let you know
as soon as we're ready to head out.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.303
May I?

04:27.308 --> 04:28.726
-There we go.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.520
You have an incredible daughter.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
And now an incredible granddaughter.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.650
God bless y'all.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.042
Oh, hey there, uh…

04:54.294 --> 04:56.212
You're Isaac, right?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.130
Yeah.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.758
I thought you and Noreen
might want some space, Dr. Townsend.

05:00.842 --> 05:05.096
Yeah. You… you know,
Noreen speaks so highly of you.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.433
Thank you for being
such a good friend and neighbor to her.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.184
Of course. Happy to help.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.520
Would you do something for me?

05:13.187 --> 05:15.773
Call me if they ever need anything.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.986
-Anything at all, all right?
-Yeah.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.279
I appreciate that.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.203
I read the report
from the new agribusiness manager,

05:29.287 --> 05:31.331
and I have to say
I love the soybean rotation plan.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.790
Wonderful. Let's talk later.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.752
You know how I love a good steak
or even Erik's chicken pot pie,

05:35.835 --> 05:38.921
but maybe we could explore
some, uh, vegan options for the menu.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.008
Cal, partner,
I appreciate all your enthusiasm,

05:42.091 --> 05:45.136
but right now you're more sugar in my tank
than grease on my axle.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.763
Got it. Not the right time.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.349
So just go ahead and take a look
at the proposal packet

05:49.432 --> 05:52.060
I left on your desk already,
and just get back to me when you can.

05:52.143 --> 05:56.230
And I am gonna help you by, um… leaving.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.441
Yeah.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.155
Never in all my born days did I think

06:04.238 --> 06:06.908
that what I would cherish most
about Micah being my silent partner

06:06.991 --> 06:08.951
is that he was silent.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.828
-Cal means well.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.122
I mean, it's great
he's so excited to be part of the team.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.000
Well, his heart's in the right place.
The rest of him, not so much.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.087
I got four orders for the hash and eggs,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.672
um, and three orders
for the baseball star.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.007
Excuse me?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.510
See that, Dana Sue?

06:26.469 --> 06:29.931
Put <i>him</i> on the menu,
and see what <i>that</i> does for business.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.271
Come in.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.859
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.362
I hope you don't mind. I heard the news,

06:44.445 --> 06:48.282
and I just wanted to come by
and congratulate you in person.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.495
Oh no, no. No, no, no.
Don't you dare get up.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.663
I just…

06:53.746 --> 06:55.957
-May I?
-Mm-hmm.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.216
Oh.

07:06.050 --> 07:06.926
Noreen.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.761
This is my little Peanut.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.722
Rebecca Lynne Fitzgibbons.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.808
She is glorious.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.726
Isn't she though?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.396
Um…

07:18.980 --> 07:20.231
I brought her somethin'.

07:31.033 --> 07:34.829
The knitting circle
at Prince of Peace made that for Ty.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.041
I brought all three of mine home
in that blanket.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.755
I just… I thought
that it would be only fitting

07:44.839 --> 07:48.926
that Rebecca came home from the hospital
in the same blanket that her siblings did.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.178
Thank you.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.810
Noreen, I've been thinkin'

07:58.478 --> 08:01.689
and prayin' on this for a bit.

08:04.692 --> 08:09.614
It's not fair to all four children
for the two of us to be at odds.

08:10.781 --> 08:15.119
The burdens of the adults don't need
to carry on to the next generation.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.748
For the sake of the children,

08:21.334 --> 08:23.419
I hope that you and I could reconcile.

08:25.796 --> 08:26.881
I would love

08:27.507 --> 08:30.843
to move forward together

08:31.427 --> 08:34.472
towards forgiveness
if you're still open to that.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.021
Oh my goodness.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.442
Oh my goodness.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.156
She's perfect.

08:57.954 --> 09:02.959
I know I've been evasive
with your questions about my past.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.296
There are parts of that life I'm…

09:09.715 --> 09:11.467
I'm still processing.

09:13.844 --> 09:14.971
Shall we sit?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.400
I haven't always been a chef.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.734
Oh, I gathered.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.279
I was an EMT in Atlanta.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.324
Loved my job.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.035
Loved my friends.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.912
Fell in love and

09:41.330 --> 09:42.290
got married.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.584
Vera.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.754
We were so excited to start a family.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.258
We got pregnant.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.679
We could see a beautiful future.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.307
She was 24 weeks along.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.434
Vera had some bleeding.

10:02.935 --> 10:06.480
I was sure that I could get her
to the hospital faster than…

10:10.318 --> 10:11.944
But the bleeding got worse.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.906
I tried everything I knew
there on the side of the road,

10:15.990 --> 10:17.533
waiting for the ambulance.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.164
I lost them both.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.248
Oh, Erik.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.959
The guilt.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.420
Failure.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.256
Helplessness.

10:32.340 --> 10:36.010
They led me to some truly dark places.

10:38.596 --> 10:43.142
But then my grandmama's recipe book
pulled me back out.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.978
Led me to Dana Sue

10:46.062 --> 10:47.313
and you.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.778
I am so sorry

10:55.321 --> 10:56.614
for what you lost.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.036
And I am so happy for what you found.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.041
But I can't ask you
to walk this road with me

11:07.124 --> 11:08.834
while you're still healing from this.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.294
-No, no, no.
-This is not fair.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.504
No, Helen.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.215
That's not what I'm saying.

11:14.715 --> 11:20.805
You've reawakened a portion of my soul
that I thought was closed forever.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.267
Helping you heal

11:26.435 --> 11:28.646
is also healing something in me.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.736
I think we can keep healing together.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.324
-And be better for it.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.450
Amen.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.663
But I, um…

11:46.455 --> 11:48.958
I need you to make me a promise.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.418
-Ask.
-Hmm.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.422
If my situation
ever makes the road tough for you,

11:54.505 --> 11:55.923
you say so.

11:57.925 --> 11:58.884
I will.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.858
I ran into a bunch of eager signers
outside Deb's flower shop.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.694
It was like I was walking around town

12:16.777 --> 12:19.238
with a basket
of Dana Sue's molasses cookies.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.824
Off to a good start,
but we have a long way to go.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.618
-You let me know if I need to bake.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.413
How'd you squeeze this
into your day, Maddie?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.458
Well, it's not like
I have to spend time convincing people

12:30.541 --> 12:33.878
since Trent hasn't fulfilled
most of his campaign promises.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.715
And Sunday's a perfect time
to go visitin'.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.218
Were you out campaigning
before or after you went to the hospital?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.179
Both things needed to be done.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.805
I admire you going.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.557
I don't think I could

12:47.641 --> 12:52.354
muster that much grace
even fresh off of one of June's sermons.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.690
Doesn't everyone deserve
a chance at a fresh start?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.321
To Rebecca Lynne

13:00.946 --> 13:01.781
Fitzgibbons.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.783
-Why didn't you start with that?!

13:03.866 --> 13:05.409
Saving the best for last.

13:05.493 --> 13:09.622
Well, I never thought
I would say this, but…

13:11.165 --> 13:12.833
To Rebecca.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.001
Yeah.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.670
And to Noreen.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.887
-Dana Sue.
-Mm-hmm.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.682
How are you handling the kitchen now
with Isaac on good-neighbor leave?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.143
You know this how?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.562
Erik said that brunch was a little hectic.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.989
He dropped by
for a glass of tea this afternoon!

13:44.073 --> 13:46.200
-And?
-And nothing!

13:46.992 --> 13:47.910
Well,

13:48.869 --> 13:49.703
something.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.373
We're still figuring things out.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.834
Does this include the fact
that you're trying to have a baby?

13:54.917 --> 13:57.503
Yeah, he knows.
We're being very transparent.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.840
And Erik is happy to support my journey.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.635
-How did it go with Dr. Ringle?
-Promising. Exciting, actually.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.845
And

14:06.637 --> 14:09.515
Erik is going with me next time.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.142
Why do I find this
to be terribly romantic?

14:12.226 --> 14:14.812
-'Cause it is.
-All right, hold your horses.

14:14.895 --> 14:18.232
Have you considered the two of you
doing this the old-fashioned way?

14:18.315 --> 14:19.275
Dana Sue!

14:19.358 --> 14:22.528
We just went from the friend zone
to the not-friend zone.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.698
I think it's a little early
to consider the baby-daddy zone.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.824
Okay.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.325
She's just…

14:28.409 --> 14:31.120
She's just been spending
so much time rollin' around with Ronnie.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.122
-This girl's all revved up.
-Ah, come on!

14:33.205 --> 14:36.000
Can we please talk about <i>your</i> man, Maddie?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.084
Oh-ho!

14:37.167 --> 14:38.502
Okay, you know I love Cal,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.755
but you have to help me
calm him the heck down.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.842
So many plans and ideas
and ideas and plans and plans and--

14:44.925 --> 14:47.303
-No, he's just excited.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.387
He wants to help.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.307
And how's it going
calming Ronnie down, Dana Sue?

14:51.390 --> 14:55.811
I am doing an excellent job
of maintaining boundaries with him

14:56.353 --> 14:59.315
and managing Annie's expectations.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.322
-You practice that before you got here?
-Yeah.

15:13.454 --> 15:17.124
Okay. Let's all just sit down,
and we need to come up with a plan.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.668
-Ow!
-Hey. Take… take it easy, Ty.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.253
I've been taking it easy all summer.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.756
I wanna get back at it,
but I just… I can't.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.258
We talked to Dr. Ahmed, okay?
This is gonna take some work.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.303
I know. And you told me not to expect
a miracle when the cast came off,

15:29.386 --> 15:30.971
but this feels like the same--

15:31.055 --> 15:33.557
-You have to be patient.
-How much longer?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.145
And… and what if my arm
never gets back to 100%?

15:38.228 --> 15:40.522
-Honey.
-I'm fine.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.483
Okay? I just…

15:44.526 --> 15:45.486
Excuse me.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.705
This is a process.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.707
-Mmm.
-For both of you.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.419
-It's not gonna be over quickly.
-I know.

16:04.546 --> 16:08.467
And me being impatient with his impatience
is not gonna help anyone.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.137
You know what might help?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.975
A vacation to an exotic beach?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.395
That is an excellent idea.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.964
You were just here
for Sunday dinner, Peggy.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.134
What's so all-fired important
that you're back today?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.596
Um…

16:54.680 --> 16:55.639
Mother,

16:57.141 --> 17:00.436
something has happened
that will have ramifications,

17:00.519 --> 17:01.979
and I want you to be aware.

17:02.479 --> 17:06.483
But I thought it appropriate
to share it with you privately first.

17:06.567 --> 17:11.071
You're a journalist, Peggy.
You know better than to bury the lead.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.284
I met my son.

17:17.578 --> 17:22.541
His name is Isaac, and he seems to be
a wonderful young man.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.795
I'm going to build
a relationship with him, Mother,

17:26.879 --> 17:31.050
and I look forward
to introducing you to your grandson.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.511
I have wondered about this day,
about him, for so many--

17:34.595 --> 17:38.474
I didn't go through all that mess
you brought home 22 years ago

17:38.557 --> 17:42.603
to have some stranger upend our lives now.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.273
It was my mess, Mother,
and you never asked me what I wanted.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.734
I did what any good mother would.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.696
I have no interest in meeting him.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.699
You send him away.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.213
I can't wait to get home
and start pampering our girls.

18:09.296 --> 18:13.217
Mom, it's such a long drive. Do you think
maybe we could stay an extra day or so?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.427
If that's okay with you, Isaac?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.013
Yeah. Noreen, you and Becks
stay as long as you want.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.016
Are we calling her Becks? Not even Becky?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.435
Well, it's Peanut first and forever.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.313
-Let me take that sweet little lamb.
-Peanut.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.481
Hmm.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.150
-You can, um, change her on my bed.
-Oh. All right.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.110
I can show you.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.162
So tell me, Shortcake,

18:43.163 --> 18:44.498
how you <i>really</i> doing?

18:44.998 --> 18:46.834
-I'm fine, Daddy.
-Hmm?

18:46.917 --> 18:49.878
Really. I just need to catch my breath.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.842
Well, we don't mean
to chase you outta here, but

18:56.260 --> 18:58.428
you just let us know
when you're ready, huh?

19:01.849 --> 19:05.477
Miss Elizabeth
was worried you were parched.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.436
I'm fine.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.605
But this does taste good.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.776
She was such a diligent gardener
in her younger years,

19:12.860 --> 19:16.071
and she is so excited
that her lawn is gonna look good again.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.115
Her nephew's been deployed
for a while now,

19:18.198 --> 19:22.327
and she's had a hard time finding someone
who tends to her yard properly.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.121
Did you tell her why I'm doing it?

19:24.830 --> 19:25.664
I did.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.334
Because you are a young man
committed to his faith

19:29.918 --> 19:33.338
and the love of our neighbors
that flows naturally from that.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.426
The truest form
of community service.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.343
Yes, ma'am.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.556
Listen, I know this isn't exciting,

19:43.307 --> 19:46.226
but remember
what your friend Mr. Shakespeare said.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.354
"There is nothing either good or bad,

19:50.063 --> 19:52.733
but thinking makes it so."

19:54.610 --> 19:57.237
Oh yeah, I can quote
more than just Scripture.

19:59.448 --> 20:04.995
Now, I'm going back to Miss Elizabeth,
and you get back to this arbor.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.712
Is this a dagger which I see before me,

20:15.005 --> 20:18.383
the handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.224
I have thee not, yet I see thee still.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.686
Hey! I'm looking for Puck.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.064
Achievement unlocked.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.565
Am I supposed to know you?

20:34.358 --> 20:35.192
No.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.027
Not yet, but that's fine.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.613
At school, I saw your Shakespeare thing,

20:39.696 --> 20:42.658
which really isn't my thing,
but who passes up extra credit?

20:42.741 --> 20:46.245
It was better than I expected,
and <i>you</i> were amazing.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.538
It worked out because you're
exactly what I'm looking for.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.456
What?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.751
I'm creating a game.
An awesome quest-based adventure.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.544
I've got the code-side covered
and then some,

20:54.628 --> 20:56.630
but I thought
teaming up with a terrific actor

20:56.713 --> 21:00.342
would help with character design
and, when we get there, mocap.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.677
Oh.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.679
Wow, motion capture? Really?

21:03.762 --> 21:04.596
Really!

21:04.680 --> 21:08.141
Because where most games fall apart
for me, as a player, is authentic emotion.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.853
I mean, you got this guy who just traveled
three centuries to slay his archnemesis,

21:11.937 --> 21:15.816
and he's all…
…"I have searched for you far and wide."

21:15.899 --> 21:19.945
Uh, but… I want passion
and range and surprising reactions,

21:20.028 --> 21:21.488
which is why I want <i>you</i>.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
Wait, how did you know I was here?

21:24.366 --> 21:25.951
Oh, Puck.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.537
I can track anyone, anywhere.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.624
Ready for an adventure?

21:40.507 --> 21:43.385
How do we have any idea
what Noreen's taste is?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.015
Maddie.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.517
Your mother certainly knows how to shop.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.519
I thought I was queen
of the good purchase,

21:52.602 --> 21:54.896
but I bow to Miss Paula's expertise.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.486
Aw.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.241
Won't be long before we're making
one of these baskets for you.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.161
Wonderful! You're all here.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.872
Miss Frances, what a pleasure to see you.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.124
I came to sign that recall petition.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.168
-Yes.
-Oh! Let me get it for you.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.544
When you girls said

22:17.627 --> 22:21.298
you were gonna continue my legacy
with the spa, that was special enough,

22:21.381 --> 22:25.093
but you have taken things
to a new level of special.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.640
Miss Frances?

22:30.724 --> 22:35.896
We held the Wingate Family
Chamber Music soirees in this room.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.482
Raised funds for local charities.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.691
I remember.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.944
It was for adults,
but you would always let us kids

22:43.028 --> 22:45.030
waltz about on that front porch.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.949
My favorite was learning
how to pour proper tea on the lawn.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.034
-Oh.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.619
What about the croquet matches?

22:50.702 --> 22:52.454
And the time you, Miss Maddie,

22:52.537 --> 22:55.832
hit the croquet ball so hard
it sailed right through that window.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.335
That's why I didn't teach my kids
how to play croquet.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.630
Oh, amazing how my family legacy lives on

23:01.713 --> 23:04.549
in the beauty and strength
of those little girls.

23:05.842 --> 23:11.264
I am so grateful to you three
for giving our precious Serenity

23:11.348 --> 23:13.225
so much hope for the future.

23:14.267 --> 23:18.647
Now, where do I sign
to get that miserable snake out of office?

23:18.730 --> 23:21.191
-Right here.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.302
Thought you might be here.
Are you waiting for someone?

23:49.386 --> 23:50.429
Not anymore.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.392
Do you want something? On me.
This is my favorite. You wanna try?

23:55.892 --> 23:56.893
Okay.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.566
-Ugh! Hazelnut?
-You don't like hazelnut?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.318
Well, then we can't be friends.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.529
So, then, what should we be?

24:07.612 --> 24:08.572
Sworn enemies?

24:08.655 --> 24:10.157
Contenders for the same crown.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.493
Hmm. Spies on the opposite sides
who are supposed to undo each other

24:13.577 --> 24:14.828
but team up to save the world.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.414
I like that one.
But which side did I start on?

24:17.497 --> 24:20.041
The wrong one, of course,
and I bring you around.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.503
You and the three million dollars
of diamonds we'll split when this is over.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.298
Why would we split them?
Aren't we going to stay together?

24:30.594 --> 24:32.471
Hey. How about this one?

24:32.554 --> 24:36.850
Guy is stupid and vain enough
to hurt a special girl,

24:36.933 --> 24:39.811
and that special girl
is gracious enough to forgive him.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.688
Is that why you kissed me?

24:42.564 --> 24:43.440
To apologize?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.860
I kissed you

24:47.986 --> 24:49.946
because you're important to me.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.282
And I hope you kissed me back

24:52.365 --> 24:54.659
because you think
we could be incredible together.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.205
We could be,

24:58.872 --> 25:01.333
as long as
I don't have to drink hazelnut coffee.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.501
I'll think about it.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.128
Okay.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.464
-Oh, precious as a pearl.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.176
When Annie was this size, I just wanted
to sit and stare at her all day long.

25:11.259 --> 25:14.387
Hmm. Angels truly do live among us.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.181
Hmm.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.058
Congratulations.

25:18.808 --> 25:19.935
Thank you for that.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.811
And for this.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.105
-Hmm.
-And just for being here.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.400
And thank you so much for giving
Isaac time off work to help me.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.070
I just cannot even begin
to express how much.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.197
Well, it's just how we do it
here in Serenity.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.198
Oh.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.450
Erik sent this along.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.620
And he implores you
to bring Rebecca back to Serenity

25:38.703 --> 25:40.497
so he can make her
her first chicken pot pie.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.414
Aw.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.500
Oh, Helen,
can I get your help in the kitchen?

25:45.001 --> 25:47.170
I was hoping to meet your parents, Noreen.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.339
They just went out for a stroll.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.926
Well, that'll be them.

25:53.009 --> 25:53.927
Hey, guys!

25:54.010 --> 25:54.970
Great house!

25:55.053 --> 25:57.597
Oh, look! It's a party!

25:57.681 --> 25:59.683
-Shh. She's asleep.
-Oh, oh, oh.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.935
You'd almost think
we all whisper together or something.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.146
Oh my gosh.
My heart is full to bursting, y'all.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.856
Oh.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.903
-Bless you and your little one, Noreen.
-Thank you. Thank you!

26:12.404 --> 26:13.363
Oh.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.615
Flowers for you

26:16.283 --> 26:18.368
and music for her.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.912
But if you wanna keep the rattle
and give her the flowers,

26:20.996 --> 26:21.997
I'm cool with that too.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.373
Thank you.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.084
-Look at this little baby. Look how cute.
-What is it?

26:26.167 --> 26:28.545
Trust me,
you never can have too many diapers.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.757
You know, I had no idea how much
can come out of such a tiny little human

26:32.841 --> 26:33.758
at one time.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.718
Thank you.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.761
-Where do you want it?
-Uh…

26:38.388 --> 26:40.432
Oh. Oh, look at you.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.809
So you're really gonna do this?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.688
Well, not exactly this, but, yeah.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.024
I do have one question though.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.277
I hope it's one I'm qualified to answer.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.738
Isn't it terrifying?

26:55.864 --> 26:58.074
Isn't a pennant race terrifying?

26:59.242 --> 27:00.368
No. It…

27:02.662 --> 27:03.496
Yes.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.958
Because you're praying every day,
nonstop, that you won't make a mistake,

27:07.042 --> 27:09.836
that you won't let anybody down,
that you'll do a great job.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.880
Yeah, it's terrifying.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.715
And thrilling.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.302
And wonderful.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.513
Hmm.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.059
Is there something I can do?

27:24.142 --> 27:27.187
We haven't officially met, but we know
all the same people. Ronnie Sullivan.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.897
-Nice to meet you.
-This is for you.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.735
Thank you very much, Ronnie.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.780
Before she could even sit up,
Annie always loved when we read to her.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.365
She used to chew on 'em too.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.407
Mmm.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.077
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.873
What a gift to have more friends
than your house can hold.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.458
Hey, it's all good.

27:49.209 --> 27:53.004
-We can hold them in our hearts.
-Are we interrupting a party?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.049
Mama, Daddy. Come meet--

27:56.132 --> 27:57.550
Noreen's friends.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.806
Oh, Shortcake, this is lovely.
No cause to cry.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.391
I don't mean to be such a watering pot.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.935
It's just that everyone's being
so thoughtful.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.439
Hi, I'm Maddie.
This is Helen and Dana Sue.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.318
Pardon us, but we invited ourselves over
for a little sip and see

28:15.402 --> 28:17.487
while Noreen and the baby are still here.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.948
-Y'all have to try my molasses cookies…
-My favorite.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.951
…before some people
gobble them up. 

28:23.034 --> 28:23.868
Yes, please.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.579
You're the chef
that sends all the wonderful food.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.581
Well, thank you. I am.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.375
And you're the lawyer.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.794
I am. And the three of us
own the Corner Spa.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.838
So that makes you…

28:37.882 --> 28:40.468
Yes. We thought we'd pay a call.

28:41.344 --> 28:44.097
Charlie, are you hearing this?

28:44.180 --> 28:46.808
Oh, I am, Amelia. Yeah.
It's very sweet.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.726
No.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.894
-It's--
-Mom.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.438
It's a blessing.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.733
An absolute blessing.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.235
Oh.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.994
So my dad told me
that I should get you a six-pack,

29:06.077 --> 29:08.955
and my mom said,
"Gabriel Bridges Weatherspoon!"

29:09.038 --> 29:12.000
So I split the difference
and brought you wine.

29:12.083 --> 29:12.917
Cheerwine.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.086
Cheers.

29:17.213 --> 29:21.050
-Ah, come on, man, you missed it.
-I miss you, not the jokes.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.721
Yeah, fair. It's good to see you, man.
Thanks for letting me come over.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.181
I thought your last text to me was,

29:26.264 --> 29:28.391
"I'll break the other arm
if you keep being antisocial."

29:28.475 --> 29:30.810
Yes, but I did send
that awesome penguin GIF

29:30.894 --> 29:32.896
to let you know
that the threat came from the heart.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.189
-Mmm.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.650
Man, it's not good for you
to be off by yourself.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.861
Yeah, you should tell that
to CeCe.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.196
Okay, man, what's the plan?

29:41.279 --> 29:44.365
I honestly have no idea. I'm not even sure
what to say to her at this point.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.451
No, dude, I meant
what's the plan for dinner?

29:46.534 --> 29:49.496
Let's get some protein in you,
and then we'll fix your love life

29:49.579 --> 29:51.790
and anything else in your life
that might need fixing.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.043
-This is exactly what I need.
-This is what friends are for.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.176
If someone jumps out at me,
I'm gonna scream.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.803
Seriously?

30:05.386 --> 30:07.931
I'm trying to be all romantic,
and you're worried I'm pranking you?

30:09.015 --> 30:10.475
-Where did I go wrong?
-Okay.

30:17.065 --> 30:17.899
Ah!

30:19.317 --> 30:21.820
-Now this is the best beach I've been to.
-Mmm.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.031
Well, it gets even better.

30:25.114 --> 30:28.326
Wharton's is delivering
a Hawaiian pizza in an hour,

30:28.993 --> 30:31.454
which leaves us just enough time…

30:32.163 --> 30:33.665
…for…

30:34.332 --> 30:36.084
…beach volleyball.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.127
Oh, come on.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.422
What? Is there another game
you had in mind?

30:41.506 --> 30:43.299
Um… Mm-hmm.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.311
So would that be poker or gin rummy?

30:55.395 --> 30:57.689
Well, since we're at the beach,
shouldn't it be Go Fish?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.860
It's good to know
that you are a little crazy.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.987
<i>Again</i>, trying to be romantic.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.697
That shirt is not romantic.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.824
-Do you need me to take it off?
-That'd be romantic.

31:07.907 --> 31:10.326
Well, I contemplated
a road trip to the Keys

31:10.410 --> 31:12.078
or at least Myrtle Beach,

31:12.161 --> 31:14.038
but I didn't think
either fit in your schedule,

31:14.122 --> 31:17.083
so how about I take you
to Charleston instead?

31:17.166 --> 31:20.670
You do not have to take me anywhere.
This is delightful.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.715
But I have to go to Charleston,
and I don't wanna go by myself,

31:23.798 --> 31:24.966
so please come with me.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.426
What are you talking about?

31:26.509 --> 31:30.221
An old teammate of mine asked me
to fill in at a fundraiser for St. Jude.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.432
Black tie, gourmet food,

31:32.932 --> 31:34.183
lots of schmoozing,

31:35.018 --> 31:36.019
worthy cause?

31:36.644 --> 31:37.478
Be my date?

31:37.562 --> 31:39.856
By all means.
St. Jude is a wonderful charity.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.399
I'm glad.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.943
Are you gonna wear that shirt
underneath your tux?

31:45.111 --> 31:47.363
-Give me your tens.
-Go Fish.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.948
Oh goodness.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.533
One thing though.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.954
I am there to draw fans,
and fans can sometimes be

31:56.581 --> 31:57.498
a lot.

31:58.124 --> 32:02.503
Well, thank you for the warning,
but even if it's a little extra work,

32:02.587 --> 32:07.091
it is nothing compared to everything
you've done for me and my boys.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.137
Wait a minute.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.891
Did you want me to say no
so you had an excuse not to go?

32:14.974 --> 32:16.726
I always enjoy seeing the old gang.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.562
It's just preparing to see them
that can be a bit…

32:20.146 --> 32:20.980
Tell me.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.405
I didn't leave the game
on my own terms.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.033
I left because I was an immature idiot.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.410
Crashed my bike,
wrecked my hip and my shoulder,

32:34.494 --> 32:35.662
ended my career.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.956
-I've seen the scars.
-Inside and out.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.459
I thought

32:42.585 --> 32:44.170
<i>that</i> world was everything.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.049
And I was so wrong.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.398
You.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.443
Your kids. Our friends.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.488
<i>This</i> is everything.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.826
Just stepping back into that world…

33:17.829 --> 33:20.206
it just reminds me how fragile it all is.

33:23.876 --> 33:27.880
Well, just because it's fragile
doesn't mean it has to break.

33:29.090 --> 33:33.803
It just means you have to…
work a little harder to protect it.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.809
Have you ever seen <i>From Here to Eternity</i>?

33:40.685 --> 33:41.894
-Mmm.
-Hmm?

34:02.749 --> 34:03.875
Good morning.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.002
Yes, it is.

34:06.961 --> 34:10.173
Especially since you want
to discuss my proposals.

34:10.256 --> 34:14.594
Cal, I appreciate your enthusiasm
and your can-do energy,

34:14.677 --> 34:17.430
and I think it's a waste
to have you penned up here in the back.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.723
Here's my pitch.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.932
Oh.

34:20.016 --> 34:20.892
Oh!

34:21.893 --> 34:26.022
What do you think about being out front?

34:27.023 --> 34:29.484
The welcoming face of Sullivan's.

34:29.567 --> 34:32.445
-Oh, I know a curveball when I see one.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.655
And I know that my ideas

34:34.739 --> 34:37.784
haven't really been exactly scoring
as of late,

34:37.867 --> 34:39.744
but I… I do really wanna help.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.747
No, this will. I don't mean everyday host.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.333
I mean celebrity owner

34:46.375 --> 34:49.378
who makes sure
you're comfortable and happy.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.631
-Hospitality and charm.

34:52.548 --> 34:53.549
Yeah, I can do that.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.843
Yeah. And it'll make
the nights you're out there

34:55.927 --> 34:57.428
extra special for our customers.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.681
Good marketing, Chef. I'm all in.

35:00.765 --> 35:01.724
Oh!

35:01.808 --> 35:03.893
But I do have some thoughts
about the uniform.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.603
Should I get a Sullivan's coat like yours?

35:05.686 --> 35:08.481
Or even better, I'm about to dust off
my old tux? Or maybe--

35:08.564 --> 35:10.066
Oh, don't say wet T-shirt.

35:20.910 --> 35:21.869
Thank you.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.374
We started poorly, and I--

35:26.457 --> 35:27.708
I know it was a shock.

35:29.085 --> 35:29.919
For me too.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.214
For a long time,
I wondered what it might be like

35:33.297 --> 35:34.549
if this day ever came.

35:35.216 --> 35:38.219
Look, I completely get it
if you're upset or disappointed or--

35:38.302 --> 35:39.637
No, Isaac, no. Please.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.223
I'm… I'm not at all disappointed or upset.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.224
Just

35:44.559 --> 35:45.518
processing.

35:45.601 --> 35:46.561
Of course.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.525
Is this what brought you to Serenity?

35:54.861 --> 35:58.656
Now that your question's been answered,
um, will you stay?

36:01.242 --> 36:02.827
Yeah, it's… it's a great town.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.497
I love my job.
I've… I've got great friends.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.332
Though some of the bigger plans
are on hold

36:08.416 --> 36:10.751
while Noreen and her baby
are staying with me.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.963
Oh, I didn't realize. You and Noreen?

36:14.046 --> 36:17.049
We're not a couple.
Um, just a friend in need.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.261
-Doing what I can to help.
-What a generous heart.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.850
Isaac, I am very happy that you found me.

36:26.434 --> 36:31.314
And if you're willing,
I'd… I'd like for us to work together

36:31.397 --> 36:34.192
and figure out
how we fit into each other's lives

36:34.275 --> 36:36.194
and how we make each other's lives fuller.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.155
Oh.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.453
This is for you.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.335
Wait.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.337
How did you know my middle name?

37:00.134 --> 37:01.552
You've been with me all this time.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.733
I was only 16 when you were born.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.152
My mother, she…

37:21.989 --> 37:26.911
The only decision that I got to make
was the name on your birth certificate.

37:28.079 --> 37:33.251
I am so blessed that your parents allowed
that small part of me to stay with you.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.836
They must be wonderful people.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.963
They are.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.549
What about my biological dad?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.719
Could we talk about him? Can I meet him?

37:45.638 --> 37:47.515
Let me reach out to him first.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.351
But let's trust that there will be a way.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.897
For the moment,
can we just talk about you and us?

37:55.398 --> 37:56.399
Please.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.150
You start.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.448
The Lord alone knows
how we're gonna shoehorn all this

38:04.532 --> 38:06.325
for the ride back to Tennessee.

38:06.409 --> 38:10.871
Now, Charlie, you're gonna drive our car
with the gifts and all.

38:11.414 --> 38:15.084
I will drive with Noreen and the baby
in her car 'cause she's got the car seat,

38:15.167 --> 38:16.377
and then we'll…

38:17.753 --> 38:18.713
Fine.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.048
Drive with your daddy if you'd rather.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.301
Maybe we can switch off
when we stop for lunch.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.177
Amelia, hear the girl out.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.849
I really do thank y'all for coming.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.601
I'm so grateful
that you and Daddy are here.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.230
You being such an amazing help and all,
but that's not a surprise

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
since you're the best mother there is.

38:38.399 --> 38:43.738
But I've decided that Rebecca and I
are gonna stay in Serenity.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.784
You… you knew this?

38:50.369 --> 38:51.704
And you didn't talk her out of it?

38:52.288 --> 38:55.291
That's not his job,
and I couldn't be swayed.

38:55.374 --> 38:56.292
Honey…

38:59.086 --> 39:00.713
you're alone.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.342
Amelia, we have seen fine proof otherwise.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.676
They're not family.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.557
You see that sweet little blanket
over there on Peanut?

39:11.640 --> 39:13.059
You know who gave it to her?

39:13.684 --> 39:15.061
Maddie Townsend.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.897
It's the same baby blanket
that she used on her three children.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.940
Rebecca has family here too.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.108
Noreen.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.570
Oh, I was looking forward
to seeing my girls on a daily basis.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.074
And your brothers
are gonna be so disappointed.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.493
Garth and Aaron will understand.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.203
Oh!

39:33.120 --> 39:36.123
All right. Well, you hear me out
on this one thing.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.792
We're gonna visit.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.460
A lot.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.712
I will miss you each and every day.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.005
-Mmm.
-Oh.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.842
And if you don't come home
to visit often enough,

39:46.926 --> 39:49.428
we will be on your doorstep lickety-split.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.530
Praise the Lord!
You brought reinforcements.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.365
You. Roll towels.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.035
And you may need to expand the staff.
I'm a man of many talents,

40:13.119 --> 40:15.496
but so far, I've only been able
to be in three places at once.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.915
This is an impressive crowd.
Though you've been telling me

40:17.998 --> 40:20.418
since before this place opened
that men aren't allowed in here,

40:20.501 --> 40:21.961
and now my feelings are getting hurt.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.547
-They're just here for the club meetings.
-There are clubs now?

40:24.630 --> 40:27.174
One investing club,
one knitting club, and two book clubs

40:27.258 --> 40:29.093
have sprouted up
since the community meeting.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.803
It's exciting, and it's good for business.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.013
But I already feel
like I'm behind for the day,

40:33.097 --> 40:35.558
and I have to pick up the boys
in an hour from physical therapy.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.101
So could you please share with me

40:37.184 --> 40:39.645
what on my to-do list
is the most pressing?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.105
Which to-do list?

40:41.188 --> 40:43.149
A dedicated phone line
to your political career

40:43.232 --> 40:44.316
would be a huge help.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.860
With everybody calling the same line,

40:45.943 --> 40:47.695
I almost booked
an angry youth soccer coach

40:47.778 --> 40:50.364
complaining about field conditions
into my afternoon yoga class.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.740
Isn't that great?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.742
No. No, the class
would not have gone well.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.287
I mean, clearly,
people are eager to be heard.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.081
And they don't wanna just rant.
They wanna help.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.332
They wanna participate.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.460
We are gonna need volunteers
to make changes happen.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.212
But who's gonna volunteer
for the biggest task of all?

41:05.963 --> 41:08.007
Who's gonna run for mayor
when we get rid of Trent?

41:08.924 --> 41:10.092
I have some thoughts.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.093
So do I.

41:11.177 --> 41:14.847
Oh, you're both too kind,
but I must respectfully decline.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.893
The spa comes first in my heart.
But my dedication does free up

41:18.976 --> 41:19.852
Maddie.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.230
I have not had <i>that</i> thought,
nor will I have that thought.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.524
-But <i>you </i>did have that thought.
-I <i>did</i> have that thought.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.069
Go, you two. Go. Join a club.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.287
Uh, end of shift. Good night, Mom.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you off to?

41:40.456 --> 41:43.083
Uh, to head home to change
and then go out, remember?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.961
Oh, right. Wharton's. With whom?

41:46.045 --> 41:46.879
It's a group.

41:46.962 --> 41:50.299
You know, Lily, Michael, Claire,
Megan, Jackson, Steve, the usual crowd.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.884
Shakes and jokes. All good. All chill.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.761
Okay. Home by midnight, please?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.387
No problem. See ya.

42:03.771 --> 42:04.897
All right!

42:04.980 --> 42:06.649
You wear it well, Cal.

42:06.732 --> 42:07.566
As do you.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.026
Cal!

42:10.319 --> 42:12.196
-Wow!
-Oh, this?

42:12.279 --> 42:13.614
You look amazing.

42:13.697 --> 42:14.782
-Yeah?

42:14.865 --> 42:16.242
-Come on!
-Yeah?

42:16.325 --> 42:18.369
Follow me, superstar.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.379
Ladies, Cal Maddox.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.214
-Cal.
-Hey.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.715
-He's the owner.

42:34.718 --> 42:35.928
-Thanks.
-Hey, hey.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.429
Sure.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.058
-Thanks, man.
-This is so exciting.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.602
-Let me know if you need anything.

42:49.149 --> 42:51.360
Just focus on making
the guests feel special.

42:51.443 --> 42:54.446
-Okay.
-It'll take a few to get warmed up.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.531
All right.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.117
Or not.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.745
Welcome to Sullivan's.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.414
Wow! Coach Cal!

43:03.497 --> 43:04.623
Great shoes.

43:04.707 --> 43:05.708
Great everything.

43:05.791 --> 43:07.042
Okay, he's on the clock.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.128
-Okay.
-Maddie. Hi, boys.

43:10.838 --> 43:14.758
So, what brings you out tonight?
My debut as host?

43:14.842 --> 43:17.136
Sorry, Coach.
I'm here for the fried chicken.

43:17.219 --> 43:19.972
Yeah, and, uh, I'm here
for the fettuccine Alfredo,

43:20.055 --> 43:21.849
but… respect.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.395
I am taking the boys to dinner

43:26.937 --> 43:30.608
to congratulate them for their first day
in physical therapy together.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.861
Well, in that case, allow me to go speak
with Isaac about a surprise dessert

43:33.944 --> 43:36.113
because this table should be celebrated.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.031
Okay.

43:37.531 --> 43:40.909
Well, if this is a celebration,
maybe we should start with dessert, Mom.

43:40.993 --> 43:43.370
-Tyler.
-You've got pull here, right, Coach?

43:43.454 --> 43:46.665
Gentlemen, let me offer you
an invaluable piece of advice.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.376
Listen to the smart woman in your life.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.428
Didn't expect to see you here.

43:59.928 --> 44:02.890
Hey. Yeah, I just thought
I'd do a few odds and ends.

44:02.973 --> 44:04.892
Was hoping to wish Annie a good night.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.019
Where is she?

44:07.603 --> 44:10.189
Some group outing.

44:10.272 --> 44:14.318
Although I'm a little bothered
that Jackson is a part of that group.

44:14.860 --> 44:15.778
Course he is.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.614
Telling you, there's something
going on between those two.

44:21.533 --> 44:22.534
What do you know about it?

44:22.618 --> 44:25.162
Saw them kissing
outside of VBS the other night.

44:25.245 --> 44:27.206
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

44:27.289 --> 44:29.208
Why didn't you say something?

44:29.291 --> 44:35.339
I cannot believe that we have to have
the co-parenting conversation!

44:35.422 --> 44:38.717
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've… I should've said something.

44:39.635 --> 44:43.138
I'm sorry,
so you're just agreeing with me.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.516
No argument?

44:45.599 --> 44:46.433
Yeah.

44:47.142 --> 44:47.976
I am.

44:48.852 --> 44:49.978
Because you're right.

44:50.062 --> 44:51.397
Well, that

44:52.731 --> 44:54.525
is a big step forward.

44:56.610 --> 44:59.029
Yeah, it is.

45:08.872 --> 45:11.125
Feels good to be
on the same team again, doesn't it?

45:12.793 --> 45:13.711
It does.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.141
-These are for you.
-Oh! Thanks.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.477
-All right.

45:49.163 --> 45:50.998
I admire your restraint.

45:51.081 --> 45:52.291
With the food?

45:52.833 --> 45:55.210
With not going up on stage
and showing them how it's done.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.380
I'm just following your lead.

45:59.381 --> 46:00.632
I'll keep that in mind.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.762
I'm glad it's a different vibe tonight.

46:04.845 --> 46:05.804
Oh.

46:07.055 --> 46:07.931
Yes, it is.

46:08.515 --> 46:10.350
Thanks for the invitation.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.896
And thanks for picking Jazz Night.
I'm a lifelong fan.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.231
-Lifelong?
-Yeah.

46:17.316 --> 46:18.192
Like,

46:19.359 --> 46:24.615
when I close my eyes
and see our house when I was a child,

46:25.741 --> 46:27.659
I… I hear jazz,

46:27.743 --> 46:32.748
and I see my parents
swaying in the kitchen

46:33.373 --> 46:35.667
as though they were dancing at Birdland.

46:37.878 --> 46:38.879
How about you?

46:38.962 --> 46:41.507
I don't remember where or when it started,

46:41.590 --> 46:44.384
but jazz has always fascinated me.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.594
How so?

46:45.677 --> 46:46.637
Improvisation.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.681
The way the musicians trade off.

46:49.765 --> 46:52.768
Who rises. Who falls.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.523
When they're in harmony.
When they're contrapuntal.

46:57.606 --> 46:58.440
Hmm.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.651
-Contrapuntal.

47:01.318 --> 47:04.238
Always swirling around each other

47:04.321 --> 47:06.990
but always finding
their way back to the melody.

47:09.034 --> 47:11.286
They always find their way
back to each other.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.665
Through empathy and

47:15.791 --> 47:17.125
shared experience.

47:19.837 --> 47:20.921
Trust.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.381
Isn't that love?

47:23.340 --> 47:25.092
Something awfully close to it.

48:37.706 --> 48:38.540
Oh God!

48:38.624 --> 48:40.542
-Oh!
-Annie! Ooh! Annie!

48:45.130 --> 48:46.214
Oh!
