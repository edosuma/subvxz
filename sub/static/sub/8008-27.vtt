00:31.654 --> 00:33.922
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

00:33.923 --> 00:36.625
It's not like I have a lot
of free time, you know.

00:36.626 --> 00:38.693
Peebs, you work too much.

00:38.694 --> 00:40.829
Imagine a pizza.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.864
Only half should be business.

00:42.865 --> 00:45.000
The rest should be personal.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.632
Personal pizza.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.036
Yuck.

00:48.037 --> 00:49.704
Try to have fun tonight.

00:49.705 --> 00:51.139
With the Ice King?

00:51.140 --> 00:54.342
Not in your everlasting
lifetime, girlfriend.

00:54.343 --> 00:56.445
I wish you'd call him Simon.

00:56.446 --> 00:59.181
He's actually kind of sweet and funny.

01:04.587 --> 01:07.322
Can you please try to get along tonight?

01:07.323 --> 01:08.990
It would mean a lot to me.

01:09.621 --> 01:11.226
I'll try.

01:11.227 --> 01:14.095
Try anything once, that's what I say.

01:14.096 --> 01:15.430
Simon!

01:16.065 --> 01:17.365
What's this?

01:17.366 --> 01:18.834
It's a present.

01:18.835 --> 01:20.702
To bribe you for coming over.

01:20.703 --> 01:23.004
You don't have to bribe us, silly.

01:23.005 --> 01:25.907
We're here because we want
to hang out with you.

01:25.908 --> 01:28.510
No one has ever said that to me before.

01:29.512 --> 01:31.813
You didn't say, "No take backs."

01:35.585 --> 01:37.452
Bottoms down.

01:45.862 --> 01:47.496
So, check it out!

01:47.497 --> 01:50.131
I upgraded my home karaoke system.

01:50.132 --> 01:53.040
Do you like karaoke?

01:53.041 --> 01:55.403
Duh! We love karaoke.

01:55.404 --> 01:58.073
Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike!

01:58.074 --> 02:02.043
Okay. You guys get started,
I'll freshen up PB's drink.

What's going on?

02:30.439 --> 02:32.340
Something's wrong with the I.K.

02:32.341 --> 02:35.310
No! Simon!

02:35.311 --> 02:37.746
Hi, Marceline.

02:37.747 --> 02:39.781
Are you guys pranking me?

02:39.782 --> 02:42.083
Your friend just majorly malfunctioned!

02:42.084 --> 02:43.652
He was jerking around all weird,

02:43.653 --> 02:45.854
and his voice sounded
like he was possessed!

02:45.855 --> 02:47.389
Cool out, B-Bell.

02:47.390 --> 02:51.293
I know you love karaoke, but you
can't take it so seriously.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.432
I hope you like penguin cuisine.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.067
It's mostly just shapes.

02:59.068 --> 03:01.636
Who doesn't love a good rhomboid?

03:01.637 --> 03:04.506
You're a rhomboid.

03:07.109 --> 03:08.143
Here, Simon.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.145
I know these are your favos.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.546
Thanks, Gunther!

03:11.547 --> 03:13.582
He just called you "Gunther."

03:13.583 --> 03:16.785
He calls everybody Gunther.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.037
Bonnie!

03:19.038 --> 03:21.722
There's something really
wrong with Simon.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.858
There's some wrong with... Wait.

03:23.859 --> 03:25.293
You just called him Simon.

03:25.294 --> 03:26.795
Call me whatever you want.

03:26.796 --> 03:29.397
This is the best date I've
been on since my last date.

03:29.398 --> 03:30.932
This is not a date.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.734
Neither was the last one.

03:32.735 --> 03:34.035
It was a robbery.

03:34.036 --> 03:34.903
For real?

03:34.904 --> 03:37.372
Yeah. She stole my heart.

03:37.373 --> 03:38.573
And my crown.

03:38.574 --> 03:40.909
Your crown....

03:43.813 --> 03:46.581
Crubs! He's really flipping out!

03:52.822 --> 03:55.423
What'd you do that for?!

03:55.424 --> 03:57.232
It just makes things easier.

03:58.127 --> 04:01.529
I'm definitely seeing
some weird activity here.

04:01.530 --> 04:04.899
It's really, really...

04:04.900 --> 04:06.868
You don't know what's going on.

04:06.869 --> 04:09.838
Maybe I can access it
with my VR equipment.

04:13.309 --> 04:15.377
Whoa, Bon-bon!

04:15.378 --> 04:16.577
This stuff is rad.

04:16.579 --> 04:18.113
Why haven't you shown me before?

04:18.113 --> 04:20.130
I didn't think you liked science.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.615
I like games.

04:21.616 --> 04:23.151
We can play sometime.

04:23.152 --> 04:25.887
But this time, it's business.

04:31.661 --> 04:33.628
Whoa.

04:33.629 --> 04:35.730
This is not what I was expecting.

04:35.731 --> 04:37.298
Did you press the wrong button?

04:37.299 --> 04:39.390
I never press the wrong button.

04:39.391 --> 04:42.537
Yeah, you always know
which button to press.

04:42.538 --> 04:45.206
I'm referring to the fact that
you know how to annoy me.

04:45.207 --> 04:47.008
Yeah, I got that.

04:47.009 --> 04:49.110
What I don't get is this stupid scenery.

04:49.111 --> 04:51.513
At least it's got a pretty killer beat.

04:58.888 --> 05:01.756
Wow! Two newbies at the same time!

05:01.757 --> 05:03.491
How'd you manage that?

05:03.492 --> 05:05.126
Yeah, okay.

05:05.127 --> 05:07.629
I guess if you really squeeze
together, it could fit you both.

05:07.630 --> 05:08.930
Who are you?!

05:08.931 --> 05:10.765
Are you a dinosaur?

05:10.766 --> 05:13.301
I'm a Gunther.

05:13.302 --> 05:16.037
Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?

05:16.038 --> 05:18.106
I'm practicing my drums.

05:18.107 --> 05:22.310
The others say the acoustics out
here are better than in town.

05:23.746 --> 05:25.013
What the bleep?!

05:25.014 --> 05:27.515
Yeah. That's been happening lately.

05:27.516 --> 05:29.684
You're lucky you didn't get rearranged.

05:29.685 --> 05:31.119
Ooof!

05:31.120 --> 05:33.588
Does this circuit look infected to you?

05:33.589 --> 05:37.025
I don't know. I only deal
in infectious grooves.

05:39.128 --> 05:42.363
Sounds like you guys need another brain.

05:42.364 --> 05:45.533
I'm gonna take you guys
to the the professor!

05:45.534 --> 05:48.136
He's the smartest guy I know.

05:48.137 --> 05:51.106
Next to Master Evergreen, of course.

05:57.646 --> 05:58.880
- <i>Prjon.</i>
- Hey, guys.

05:58.881 --> 06:00.682
<i>Prjon.</i> Hey, Goontz!

06:00.683 --> 06:02.417
Who are those dudes?

06:02.418 --> 06:03.651
That's Sveinn.

06:03.652 --> 06:05.120
He only wore the crown once.

06:05.121 --> 06:08.022
And the guy next to him says
he's the first "Santa."

06:08.023 --> 06:10.125
Like, what's even a "Santa"?

06:10.126 --> 06:12.694
Dude,<i> the</i> Santa?

06:12.695 --> 06:14.785
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

06:17.666 --> 06:20.535
Aha! There he is!

06:20.536 --> 06:22.203
Professor Petrikov!

06:22.204 --> 06:23.505
Simon!

06:23.506 --> 06:24.806
Marcy!

06:24.807 --> 06:27.342
Dear! How is this possible?

06:27.343 --> 06:30.645
Did my beloved Betty master
the secrets of the crown?

06:30.646 --> 06:32.914
No. Bonnibel scienced us in.

06:32.915 --> 06:35.984
You must be Betty's little assistant.

06:35.985 --> 06:37.485
Assistant?!

06:37.486 --> 06:39.954
I have been my own boss my entire life.

06:39.955 --> 06:41.656
I built my own lab!

06:41.657 --> 06:43.892
I've created freaking life forms!

06:43.893 --> 06:45.527
Okay!...

06:45.528 --> 06:49.497
Actually, I haven't seen Betty
since she came back to Ooo.

06:49.498 --> 06:52.734
But if Betty didn't send
you, why are you here?

06:52.735 --> 06:55.403
The crown is going ba-nay-nays.

06:55.404 --> 06:59.017
It's making Ice King act super
weird in the real world.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.154
Yes, I see.

07:01.155 --> 07:04.124
It seems to have infected much
of the crown's labyrinth.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.214
I was actually just about to
follow its path of destruction.

07:07.215 --> 07:09.217
A quest!

07:12.221 --> 07:14.155
Hey, Marcy, last time,

07:14.156 --> 07:17.058
I was so caught up in making
things right with Betty

07:17.059 --> 07:18.493
that you got left out.

07:18.494 --> 07:20.247
I'm sorry.

07:20.629 --> 07:22.028
It's okay. I get it.

07:22.029 --> 07:24.765
So, you got a boyfriend yet?

07:24.766 --> 07:26.467
Ha! No.

07:26.468 --> 07:28.502
There was this guy once,

07:28.503 --> 07:31.472
but he was a real jerk,
so I dumped him hard.

07:31.473 --> 07:33.907
Wish I'd been there to punch his face.

07:33.908 --> 07:35.342
Simon!

07:35.343 --> 07:37.244
I can punch my own jerks now.

07:39.014 --> 07:41.482
It's getting pretty bad.
I think we're close.

07:41.483 --> 07:45.753
Yeah! Can't you hear
my intense drumming?

07:50.492 --> 07:51.759
Magic Man?

07:51.760 --> 07:54.161
Magic Woman.

07:54.162 --> 07:55.929
Betty!

07:55.930 --> 07:58.432
This is the fabled Betty?

07:58.433 --> 08:00.734
I always pictured her more majestic.

08:00.735 --> 08:03.070
You know, with, guts and stuff.

08:03.071 --> 08:05.606
Betty, please, what are you doing?

08:05.607 --> 08:07.708
I'm re-programming the
crown's wish magic.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.009
Got to fix Simon.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.210
A-ha!

08:13.014 --> 08:15.382
I'm a bush!

08:15.383 --> 08:17.184
It's just on backwards.

08:17.185 --> 08:18.852
Betty's the one who's backwards.

08:18.853 --> 08:20.487
We got to get her malware out of here

08:20.488 --> 08:22.890
before she causes irreparable damage.

08:24.726 --> 08:26.293
Now!

08:26.294 --> 08:28.062
- Now!
- Hoo!

08:28.063 --> 08:29.630
Now! Aaah!

08:29.631 --> 08:32.332
There has to be a part of the real Betty

08:32.332 --> 08:33.667
in there somewhere, Gunther.

08:33.668 --> 08:36.403
If only I could reach out to her.

08:36.404 --> 08:38.672
Okay. Get in there and reach.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.607
I think I will.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.409
Betty?

08:42.409 --> 08:44.542
I'm the reason you're doing all this.

08:44.543 --> 08:45.702
I'm busy.

08:46.581 --> 08:47.848
Remember how we met?

08:47.849 --> 08:50.617
When we both reached for the
same book in the library,

08:50.618 --> 08:52.619
and I said you should
check it out first?

08:52.620 --> 08:55.089
And when you returned it,
you left a note inside,

08:55.090 --> 08:57.357
because you knew I'd borrow it next?

08:57.358 --> 09:01.261
It was the funniest, smartest
note I've ever read.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.697
I...have to work.

09:03.698 --> 09:07.801
Betty, I love you so much, but
you can't help me like this.

09:07.802 --> 09:10.871
I can and I will help you, Simon!

09:12.307 --> 09:13.974
You remember me!

09:13.975 --> 09:15.242
I-I...

09:15.243 --> 09:17.077
Stay with that feeling,
Betty! Stay with it!

09:18.246 --> 09:19.680
Betty!

09:19.681 --> 09:20.781
Simon?

09:20.782 --> 09:23.717
Betty! I can't believe
it's really you!

09:23.718 --> 09:26.019
Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar

09:26.020 --> 09:27.855
derived from Betty's memories.

09:27.856 --> 09:29.773
Close enough!

09:31.540 --> 09:32.707
Shwang!

09:32.708 --> 09:35.343
The system appears to be stabilizing.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.412
Crown shields are coming back online.

09:37.413 --> 09:39.013
What does that mean?

09:39.014 --> 09:42.116
The crown will re-seal itself
off from foreign entities.

09:42.117 --> 09:45.053
But I-I can come back
and visit Simon, right?

09:45.054 --> 09:46.587
No.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.356
What about me?

09:48.357 --> 09:51.726
Don't freak out, but
you're gonna be deleted.

09:51.727 --> 09:53.694
No!

09:53.695 --> 09:55.163
It's okay, Simon.

09:55.164 --> 09:57.331
I'm just glad I didn't
destroy your world.

09:57.332 --> 09:59.901
You are my world.

09:59.902 --> 10:01.903
Goodbye, freaks!

10:01.904 --> 10:03.938
Don't forget Gunther!

10:03.939 --> 10:05.306
Bye, dude.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.742
I'm gonna be nicer to
penguins from now on.

10:07.743 --> 10:08.733
Okay.

10:09.578 --> 10:10.745
Wait, what?

10:13.582 --> 10:14.882
Whoa.

10:14.883 --> 10:18.152
Before I go, there's something
I have to tell you.

10:18.153 --> 10:20.154
Simon: Tell me, Betty.

10:20.155 --> 10:22.723
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I...

10:22.724 --> 10:24.492
Betty!

10:31.600 --> 10:34.769
I'm seeing remnants of Betty's
program in the readouts.

10:34.770 --> 10:38.072
It's like her data left a
shadow print on the circuitry.

10:43.278 --> 10:45.580
Simon: So, what was that thing
you were gonna tell me?

10:45.581 --> 10:47.348
I just said that for drama.

10:47.349 --> 10:48.816
I figured it would drive you crazy,

10:48.817 --> 10:51.319
but at least you'd never
stop thinking about me.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.055
Betty, I never could.

10:54.056 --> 10:55.890
Mwah!

10:55.891 --> 10:57.825
I don't see anything.

10:57.826 --> 10:59.627
These are just weird dots to me.

11:01.765 --> 11:05.031
My place is trashed and I
can't remember a thing.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.434
Great dinner party?
