WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:04.605
* I am not your ordinary guy

00:06.640 --> 00:08.909
So, how's your gig going
down at the retirement home?

00:08.976 --> 00:10.111
Oh, it's crazy.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.046
This one old guy thinks
I'm his son-in-law.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.147
( Both chuckle )

00:13.214 --> 00:14.648
The other day,
he took a swing at me.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.051
Missed me by like six feet,
fell into another guy.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.952
They shattered like
a bag of light bulbs.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.224
Yeah, my mom's
getting fragile, too.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.958
I think this is gonna be
the last winter

00:25.025 --> 00:27.027
I let her
shovel the driveway.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.531
Well, I should get going.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.766
Didi's got me volunteering
at a soup kitchen.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.735
They make me wear
a hairnet.

00:34.802 --> 00:35.903
A hairnet.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.539
Oh, by -- by the way, guys,
I got this.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.973
Don't worry about it.
Can't help you.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.143
I'm into a couple
of Girl Scouts
for a lot of cookies.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.644
All right.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.283
Jimmy?

00:49.350 --> 00:50.951
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:51.018 --> 00:53.654
How are you, buddy?!
Good to see you!

00:53.721 --> 00:54.888
What?

00:54.955 --> 00:57.958
I haven't seen you
since you retired, man.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.727
You look amazing.
Look at you.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.562
Get out of here.
What have you been up to?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.131
Uh, you know,
this and that.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.265
Don't be modest.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.067
I see the
Soaring Eagle Security shirt.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.337
You're the guys who took down
bin Laden, right?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.206
All right.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.707
I know. No, no, I get it.
You can't talk about it.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.443
You're very funny,
but you know what?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.077
I only got to work
one day a week.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.679
So while you're out
patrolling the streets,

01:18.746 --> 01:20.381
now I'm sitting home
in front of the TV

01:20.448 --> 01:22.150
interrogating
a bag of Fritos.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.084
Oh.
Ooh, that sounds good.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.919
Without pants.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.055
Sounds good
with a side of weird.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.190
Yeah.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.691
We had some good times,
didn't we?

01:30.758 --> 01:33.327
It was great, man.
10 years together.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.896
That squad car's
got to feel a little lonely
without me, huh?

01:35.963 --> 01:37.765
Yeah, well, you know,
I get by.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.733
Yo, Jimmy,
let's roll, man.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.935
Hey, this is my new partner,
Nicky Dawson.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.805
Nick, this is my old partner,
Kevin Gable.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.040
I'll go get the food.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
I'm the guy.
( Chuckles )

01:49.009 --> 01:52.446
Now you got a face to go
with all the stories
and stuff, so...

01:52.513 --> 01:54.047
( Chuckles )
Stories?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.284
Christmas Eve, all
the motorcycles on the roof?

01:56.350 --> 01:57.685
That was me.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.520
No.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.822
How about breaking up
the burglary at, uh --

02:01.889 --> 02:03.324
at Galaxy Bagels?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.858
No.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.127
Me chasing that crazy deer
through the mall?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.562
It was epic.
Are you kidding me?

02:08.629 --> 02:11.465
That sounds awesome,
but no.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.301
It was awesome.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.469
But he didn't
tell you anything about me?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.271
What, is this your first day
working with him?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.139
No, uh, it's been
a few months now,

02:19.207 --> 02:20.508
Uh,
since the last guy retired.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.943
Yeah, that's me.
That's the guy
he's talking about.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.945
Oh, wait a sec.
I know who you are.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.281
You're the guy who shot
2-under at Fox Creek.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.816
That was Rodriguez.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.050
Oh.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.919
He sounds awesome.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.357
( Sighs )
Hey, babe.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.458
Hey, how was your day?

02:37.525 --> 02:38.659
It was all right.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.662
I, uh -- I ran into
Jimmy Landers at Enzo's.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.431
Oh, I love Jimmy.
How's Jimmy?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Ooh.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.234
Um, he's good,
you know.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.336
He, uh,
got a new partner.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.803
( Chuckles ) A rookie.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.639
Oh, yikes. That's got
to be rough for him.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.173
You'd think, yeah.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.377
But, uh...seems to be
working it out,
though, you know?

02:56.444 --> 02:58.111
Let me ask you a question.
Okay.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.280
You remember Teddy O'Boyle?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.581
Yeah, he was
your first partner.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.015
Exactly.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.584
Okay, that was
20 years ago.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.953
I-I was with the guy
for less than a year,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.321
and you know about him.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.956
Well, yeah, but he was
up on corruption charges,

03:09.022 --> 03:10.291
so he was in the news
a lot.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.226
That's not the point.
Okay, I told you about Teddy.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.694
Jimmy never mentions me.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.996
This new guy, he already took
him to his dad's country club

03:16.063 --> 03:17.565
and got him his own locker.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.033
I had to change my shorts
in the parking lot.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.336
Oh, I've seen that.
That's a rough 90 seconds.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.471
( Sighs )

03:23.537 --> 03:25.273
Um...

03:25.339 --> 03:27.541
well, so, I mean,
are you jealous?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.810
I'm not jealous. Guys don't
get jealous of other guys.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.679
Oh.
You know,
we're not emotional.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.980
It's just I don't know
why he would do this.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.815
I just...

03:36.317 --> 03:38.919
Okay. Well, since we've
ruled out jealousy,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.954
um, what is it?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.790
It's just weird, you know?

03:42.856 --> 03:45.359
I mean, I was with the guy
all the time.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.827
You know, we talked
about everything.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.462
It's the most important
relationship of my life.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.697
And --
Hmm.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.933
Except for you.
I knew it as I was saying it.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.134
Okay.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.371
Well, can I offer
you some advice, you know,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.573
as your
second-most-important?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.476
Okay, see, that right there --
that's why he's number 1.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.544
It's that attitude.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.078
Look, babe,
I know it hurts.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.448
But it's probably just
out of sight, out of mind.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.817
You know, you got to
get back on his radar.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.352
You should call him.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.953
I was just with him
this afternoon.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.688
I can't call him now.
It's gonna look desperate.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.123
Well, then you should
do the thing

04:16.189 --> 04:18.359
where you pretend
to call someone else,

04:18.426 --> 04:21.161
but you wind up calling him
"by mistake."

04:22.530 --> 04:25.065
That actually could work.
Okay, uh...

04:25.132 --> 04:27.468
You know what? I will just
pretend to call Duffy.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.536
Okay.
That's what I'll do

04:28.602 --> 04:30.738
and, uh...
here we go.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.641
( Clears throat )

04:33.707 --> 04:35.776
Hey, Duff. What --

04:35.843 --> 04:36.844
Uh, never mind.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.480
I actually called Duffy.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.984
( Clears throat )

04:44.051 --> 04:45.453
Hey, Duff, it's Kev.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.388
I think you dialed
the wrong number, buddy.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.689
It's -- It's Jimmy.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.458
Oh, man, my bad.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.994
My stupid fingers
all over the phone.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.897
Uh, anyway, uh, it was
great seeing you today.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.065
Great seeing you, too.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.200
Listen, we're about
to raid a crack house.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.170
So, uh, I might
have to jump in a second.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.237
Oh -- Oh, okay, ju--
Real quick.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.539
I was just wondering
if you wanted

05:05.606 --> 05:07.307
to get something on the books
for, like, tomorrow.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.843
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sounds good.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.144
Uh, what do you got in mind?

05:11.211 --> 05:14.448
Uh, you know, something
fun like, you know,

05:14.515 --> 05:18.719
just ch-- chopping down a tree
or something, you know?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.921
Uh, are we gonna go
log rolling after that?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.255
What are you talking about?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.824
Petting --
or petting cages.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.593
We can go to p--
batting cages.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.027
We can go to
batting cages.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.161
Okay, yeah.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.597
Anyways, I better go.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.499
Okay, man, I'll -- I'll, uh --
I'll just see you tomorrow.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.033
Okay, sounds good, bro.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.703
Nick, come on!
Save some crackheads for me!

05:37.270 --> 05:38.672
Who taught you
to hold a bat?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.073
What is this?
Hands together!

05:40.140 --> 05:42.075
Oh, okay, well,
I guess never learned.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.912
I must have been too busy
at the petting cages.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.688
Okay, I am not a pro,
but I think you got

05:54.755 --> 05:56.690
to swing the bat
in order to hit the ball.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.258
Just getting
my timing down, guy.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.093
Okay.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.595
All right,
I just saw the problem.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.830
I can solve this.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.533
You -- You just suck.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.134
All right, big shot.
Let's see what you got.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.569
All right,
you want me to go?

06:08.636 --> 06:09.870
I'll go.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.840
You know who would love this?
Nick.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.508
Yeah, but you know what it is
with big guys.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.143
Honestly, it's
the hand-and-eye coordination.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.411
They don't usually have that.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.179
Actually, he's not here
because he's at

06:19.246 --> 06:20.681
a children's hospital
right now.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.450
He's entertaining
the kids with this --

06:22.516 --> 06:24.251
this superhero character
he does --

06:24.317 --> 06:25.519
Police Man.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.821
( Chuckling ) Police Man?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.322
How long it take him
to come up with that one?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.192
Yeah, one of the sick kids
named him that.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.896
It's actually pretty good.
I mean, it gets to the point.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.130
It's good.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.599
By the way, nice gloves.
Where'd you get those?

06:38.666 --> 06:41.368
Actually, uh, Nicky boy
got them for me.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.370
Talk about buying a friend.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.807
Wow. Is somebody
a little threatened

06:46.874 --> 06:50.310
by the new man
in my life?

06:50.377 --> 06:52.546
No, I just got a weird vibe
about this guy.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.617
Hey, I was thinking --
I'm doing a charity event

06:56.684 --> 06:58.218
where I have to
give a speech about

06:58.285 --> 07:01.054
people in your life
that inspire you.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.090
I would love
for you to be there.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.659
Really? I mean, yeah.
I -- I think I can go.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.094
I need you to be there.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.630
Yeah, I'm there.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.599
Hey! You guys
are still here.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.866
Big boy!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.635
You guys mind if
I get a couple swings?

07:14.702 --> 07:15.969
Hit it, baby.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.572
Need some, uh...
Need some batting gloves?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.340
Uh, no, I'm good.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.381
( Ball thuds )

07:34.922 --> 07:36.757
Yeah, it's pretty
self-evident that

07:36.824 --> 07:40.360
the, uh, kid's got some
hand-eye coordination.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.130
Yeah, he's okay, but,
uh, I got to tell you --

07:43.196 --> 07:45.666
Okay, that one went through
the cage right there.

07:45.733 --> 07:46.934
So, we should be back
by 10:00

07:47.000 --> 07:49.136
unless we decide to go out
for a beer after.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.571
Okay, well,
don't worry about me.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.139
It's your night.
Have fun.

07:52.205 --> 07:56.276
Hey, what do you think?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.812
Um, well, you look nice,
but I think you --

07:58.879 --> 08:01.114
I think you should
untuck your shirt.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.282
I can't untuck.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.451
Once I tuck, I-I'm tucked,
that's it.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.219
I untuck now,
it'll be smooth up top,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.556
and the bottom will
look like a Japanese fan.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.859
Then you're tucked.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.561
Okay.
Uh, no, you look fine.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.162
I don't want fine, okay?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.631
It's like -- Look, you don't
even know me, right?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.132
You're out with
your girlfriends,

08:19.199 --> 08:20.968
and you just see me,
and I'm, like,
across the room.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.870
I'm like, "What's up?"
Okay.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.538
What are you thinking?
Just what comes to mind?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.907
Uh, well, I'm wondering
why your thumbs
are in your belt loop,

08:26.974 --> 08:28.942
and then I wonder why
me and my girlfriends

08:29.009 --> 08:30.310
are at a truck stop.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.548
Different scenario.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.383
No, you -- you're out
at the club, all right?

08:36.449 --> 08:38.018
And I walk across
the dance floor, right?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.053
Music's thumping,
and I'm just like,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.823
"Hey, what's up, girl?"

08:42.890 --> 08:46.126
And you just see me from
behind all dressed in purple,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.327
and he just gives you
one of those.
Oh.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.596
What happens then?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.030
Quick -- what comes
to your mind?

08:50.097 --> 08:52.499
Um, uh, retired plumber going
for dinner on a cruise ship.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.034
No. Boy!

08:54.101 --> 08:55.603
I don't know what
you want me to say.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.638
Look, I'm just thinking,
I don't know, more like, uh,

08:57.705 --> 09:00.273
ex-athlete who blew out
his knee and, you know,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.409
still has some muscle through
the shirt you can kind of see,

09:02.475 --> 09:03.811
like, "Whoa,
look at the ripples."

09:03.877 --> 09:05.846
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Right?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.414
No, yeah,
I could see that.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.850
I mean, and then --
Oh, and maybe you, uh,

09:09.917 --> 09:12.085
tried out once for
a semi-pro football team.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.253
Yes, that's perfect.
Keep going.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.888
But your knee
never healed right,

09:14.955 --> 09:16.890
and then you packed on a few,
and now you drive a limo.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.560
You just like to dig,
don't you?

09:20.628 --> 09:22.029
I'm sorry.
You look nice.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.065
You do, but you should
put on a jacket.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.399
Jacket? Why?

09:26.466 --> 09:29.369
Yeah, well, you said Jimmy
was doing a speech, right,

09:29.436 --> 09:31.038
about people
who inspire him.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.774
What if he calls you up?
Huh?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.442
You know,
you might be right.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.543
Yeah.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.678
He did say
he needs me there.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.779
Needs you.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.080
Wow. All right,
quick impression --

09:40.147 --> 09:41.281
What do you see
when you see me?
Okay.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.450
Right now, go, boom.
Uh, small-town minister.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.953
I love you so much.
( Laughs )

09:51.659 --> 09:52.826
Hey, Father Philip.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.494
Sorry I'm late.
Parking was crazy.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.329
They got me way down
by the Wendy's.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.667
Tucked in, huh?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.601
Yes. Is that --
Is that all right?

10:01.669 --> 10:02.936
Good look or...
No, it's fine.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.472
It's just -- You know,
it's surprising considering

10:05.538 --> 10:08.241
when you came to midnight mass
with your Jets jersey.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.978
Hey.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.312
Have you met Jimmy Landers'
new partner?

10:12.379 --> 10:13.881
What a great guy?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.515
Mm, he's okay.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.650
( Scoffs ) Okay?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.152
He donated an altar rail
to the church.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.555
Built it himself
out of Spanish driftwood.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.291
( Scoffs )

10:24.357 --> 10:26.626
All right, everybody,
thank you so much
for coming out.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.765
So, what is a hero?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.335
Hey, Father Philip,
when I go up there,

10:35.402 --> 10:37.370
is that second microphone
already on or...

10:37.437 --> 10:40.273
Actually, I -- I think
I'm going up, so...

10:40.340 --> 10:41.709
Well, he asked me
to be here.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.477
He actually said he needed
me to be here, so...

10:44.544 --> 10:45.679
Oh.
Oh, that's cool.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.247
Maybe he's gonna ask
both of us to go up.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.382
Yeah, maybe.
Or just me, either way.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.719
And that's what I'm here
to talk about.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.653
Heroes.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.955
Look at me -- I'm tearing up.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.323
I said I wasn't gonna do that.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.625
And -- And here I am.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.429
I know a lot about heroes

11:02.495 --> 11:04.597
because I've been
fortunate enough

11:04.664 --> 11:07.835
to have one ride right next
to me.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.437
Do me a favor.
Just, uh, hold my stuff.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.740
I don't want my pockets
looking bulky
when I'm up there, okay?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.207
Mm. Warm lip balm.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.609
So please help me welcome

11:16.676 --> 11:20.714
a man who knows
the true meaning of loyalty.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.782
This is it.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.216
An incredible human being.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.885
Wow.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.553
A fine-looking gentleman.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.121
Oh, thank you.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.423
An amazing,
amazing partner.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.627
Give it up for the one...
Yeah.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.029
...and only...
Here we go.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.065
...Nick Dawson.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.167
Uh, y-you go first. I just --
I'll come up in a second.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.803
( Applause )

11:42.870 --> 11:43.937
You want your stuff?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.472
No, no, no, Father,
I'm -- I'm going up.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.374
Just he's
bringing him first.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.509
Hey, I don't think so.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.479
This is
kind of their moment.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.816
And that's a good thing
'cause humility --

11:55.883 --> 11:58.852
Father, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I -- I just can't hear him.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.253
It's the middle of the night.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.955
We're on this call.
Is it dangerous?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.657
Of course it's dangerous.
You're terrified.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.028
It's your life
you're thinking about!

12:08.095 --> 12:11.664
But you got backup knowing
this man is next to you.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.466
You understand me?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.836
The only thing
running through my mind...

12:15.903 --> 12:17.971
( Clears throat ) How do I get
you back to your family?

12:18.038 --> 12:20.808
Did you hear this boy?!

12:20.874 --> 12:22.342
Hey, that was nice.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.511
Sorry. It just, uh, felt
a little written to me.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.814
That's all I'm saying.
( Laughs )

12:26.880 --> 12:29.316
I'm just kind of more of
an off-the-cuff type of guy.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.484
But, uh, I would just like
to say first off, everybody,

12:31.551 --> 12:34.087
hello, and what a great
turnout here at St. Rocco's.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.155
( Chuckles )

12:35.222 --> 12:37.791
This is my ex-partner,
Kevin Gable.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.659
Yeah, of, uh, 10 years,
we road together, right?

12:39.726 --> 12:41.261
I mean, you guys
have been riding together,

12:41.328 --> 12:43.596
what, three months now?
( Chuckles )

12:43.663 --> 12:44.898
How do you --
How do you know?

12:44.965 --> 12:48.568
Yeah, thanks, Kevin,
for coming and squeezing me in

12:48.635 --> 12:50.070
in between go-kart rides.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.905
That was very,
very cool of you.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.073
So, you're not
a cop anymore?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.374
No, no, no, no.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.775
I am, uh -- Once you're a cop,
you're always a cop.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.410
I'm just retired.
That's all.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.711
Then why'd you tuck in?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.915
It's not the best look
for you.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.351
Uh, I really don't think
this is about wardrobe.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.487
It's more about being a hero.
That's what it's -- Okay?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.122
Can you arrest people?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.457
Technically, no.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.293
Uh, I certainly have
had my share of arrests
in the day.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.864
Um, right? I actually
arrested one lady
not too far from here.

13:16.930 --> 13:22.402
She was a, uh --
Boy, how do I say this
without sounding judgy?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.472
She was a prostitute.
( Chuckles )

13:25.538 --> 13:28.608
She was.
She was, uh...

13:28.675 --> 13:31.711
She was a lady of the night.
It's out there.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.347
But, uh, and not top-shelf,
either, right?

13:34.414 --> 13:35.548
She was not, I mean...

13:35.615 --> 13:38.886
Looked a lot
like Larry Bird.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.820
Oh, boy.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.223
**

13:48.361 --> 13:49.762
Hey.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.898
How'd it go?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.065
( Keys clatter )

13:52.132 --> 13:55.002
( Sighs )

13:55.068 --> 13:58.771
I think total humiliation
sums it up.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.141
How'd the tuck-in go?

14:04.144 --> 14:08.448
I don't know how great
this new partner is.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.919
He sounds pretty great,
but...

14:11.985 --> 14:14.321
that doesn't mean
that you're not, too.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.424
You know, and if Jimmy
doesn't see that,
then that is his loss.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.627
You always know
what to say.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.230
That's -- Right there,
that's why I love you.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.933
That's why I married you.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.668
You're the most important
relationship in my life.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.770
Aww.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.605
It just
doesn't make sense.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.609
Yeah.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.710
( Sighs )

14:37.777 --> 14:39.046
I'm sorry, babe.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.948
Listen, you'll feel better
in the morning.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.116
But how about
I go upstairs and draw us

14:43.183 --> 14:44.584
a nice, hot bath right now?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.319
All right, I'll be up
in a minute, all right?
Okay.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.821
I love you.
I love you.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.828
( Knocks "Shave and a Haircut"
on door )

14:59.699 --> 15:02.970
Man, buddy, that was
tough to watch.

15:03.036 --> 15:07.240
And I once saw a guy
get impaled on a picket fence.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.943
What are you doing here?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.512
Uh, Father Philip wanted me
to return this to you.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.681
He also wanted me to tell you
he used the lip balm,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.449
so maybe you should
scissor off the top.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.952
Yeah.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.820
You gonna let me in?
( Sighs )

15:20.887 --> 15:22.956
Why'd you invite me
there tonight, huh?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.757
You just wanted me
to look like an idiot?

15:24.824 --> 15:27.094
Well, you pretty much
did that on your own.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.530
But, uh, I guess it was
a little bit of payback.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.332
Payback? For what?

15:32.399 --> 15:33.967
For what?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.868
You retired.
You never call me.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.305
You're running around
with the guys having fun.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.739
Well, you're
having fun, too, right?

15:39.806 --> 15:43.010
You're out there with
your partner, Mr. Perfect.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.812
You can do plenty of stuff
that guy can't.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.447
Really?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.682
No, he can pretty much
do everything.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.553
I mean, honestly,
most calls

15:53.620 --> 15:55.822
I don't even get out
of the squad car now.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.724
I'm like, "You got this one?"
He's like, "Yep."

15:57.790 --> 16:01.094
I'm like, "All right,
I'll fill out the paperwork."

16:01.161 --> 16:04.097
So, all the stories
about him are true?

16:04.164 --> 16:07.234
I mean, he really saved those
puppies from that burning cab?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.935
Yeah, seven of them.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.638
He took them home,
and he trained them.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.141
Four of them
are guide dogs now.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.777
One of them's an actor
and just did a movie
with Judi Dench.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.181
I saw the trailer.
He was incredible in it.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.850
He's better than me
at everything.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.319
No. He's better than me
at everything!

16:26.386 --> 16:29.256
It used to drive me crazy,
but you know what?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.791
I figured out something
we're both better at.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.226
What's that?

16:33.293 --> 16:35.195
Okay, picture this.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.763
It's late at night.

16:36.829 --> 16:41.000
We're driving on
the mean streets of Syosset.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.206
A song comes on the radio.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.407
And I turn it up.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.575
There it is.
Right?

16:48.641 --> 16:49.709
Uh-huh.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.444
And we both know
what's about to happen.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.512
Oh, yeah.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.946
I don't even have to
look at you

16:54.013 --> 16:55.682
because I know
you're gonna be there.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.384
You're right there.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.553
**

17:06.193 --> 17:10.197
( High-pitched )
* You don't bring me flowers

17:10.263 --> 17:13.700
* You don't sing me
love songs *

17:13.766 --> 17:16.536
* You hardly
talk to me anymore *

17:16.603 --> 17:21.441
* When I come through the door
at the end of the day *

17:23.143 --> 17:26.546
* I remember when

17:26.613 --> 17:29.882
* You couldn't
wait to love me *

17:29.949 --> 17:33.720
* Used to hate
to leave me *

17:33.786 --> 17:40.460
* Now after lovin' me
late at night *

17:40.527 --> 17:45.064
* When it's good
for you, baby *

17:45.132 --> 17:47.600
* And you're
feeling all right *

17:47.667 --> 17:52.572
* Well,
you just roll over *

17:52.639 --> 17:58.611
* And turn out the light

17:59.912 --> 18:06.919
* You don't bring me flowers
anymore *

18:10.657 --> 18:12.459
* It used to be
so natural *

18:12.525 --> 18:14.761
* Used to be

18:14.827 --> 18:17.130
* To talk about forever

18:17.197 --> 18:18.498
* Mm-mm-mm

18:18.565 --> 18:21.801
* But "used to be's"
don't count anymore *

18:21.868 --> 18:26.373
* They just lay on the floor
till we sweep them away *

18:26.439 --> 18:30.343
* You don't bring me
flowers *

18:30.410 --> 18:34.147
* You don't say
you need me *

18:34.214 --> 18:39.219
* You don't sing me
love songs *

18:39.286 --> 18:44.557
* Anymore

18:44.624 --> 18:47.860
( Applause )

18:50.597 --> 18:52.332
That was amazing!

18:52.399 --> 18:53.966
When you went low,
I took it up high.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.368
I can't believe it.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.170
We have to record
the next time we do this.
Yes.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.638
Without a doubt.
We should get clothes, though.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.706
We got to look
a little bit better.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.773
Yes, yes.
You know what I'm saying?

19:00.840 --> 19:01.974
Coordinating outfits.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.576
I'm telling you,
we're onto something here.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.612
Do you understand
the happiness we just
brought to these people?

19:05.678 --> 19:10.350
I think we should do this.
* Nessun dorma *

19:10.417 --> 19:14.387
* Nessun dorma *

19:14.454 --> 19:18.558
* Dilegua, o notte *

19:18.625 --> 19:23.830
* Tramontate, stelle *

19:23.896 --> 19:30.803
* Tramontate, stelle *

19:30.870 --> 19:38.177
* All'alba vincero *

19:38.245 --> 19:42.249
* Vincero *

19:42.315 --> 19:54.594
* Vincero *

19:54.661 --> 19:57.196
( Applause )

20:03.470 --> 20:05.938
( Epic music plays
on television )

20:06.005 --> 20:07.874
Oh, man, he is good.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.942
His performance --
you just buy into it.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.110
Yep.

20:11.177 --> 20:12.545
It's like
he's not even acting.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.080
Yep.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.815
I mean, the fact that
he's working with Judi Dench

20:15.882 --> 20:18.585
doesn't hurt, either.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.919
( Dog barking )

20:19.986 --> 20:21.488
You hear that?
Right on cue.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.423
Yeah.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.325
By the way,
how sick are these?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.993
Incredible. You don't even
have to chew them.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.261
They just, like,
melt in your mouth.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.696
Right.
Like, in each bite,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.831
you get a little bit of sweet,
you get a little bit of hot.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.766
Mm-hmm.
These things are amazing.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.001
The best.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.136
How are the wings, boys?

20:42.842 --> 20:43.876
Eh, they're all right.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.045
I've had better.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.147
Yeah.
Thank you.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.684
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:51.751 --> 20:55.221
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:55.288 --> 20:57.424
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:57.490 --> 20:58.958
* Do, do, do, do

20:59.025 --> 21:02.629
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:02.695 --> 21:05.698
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:05.765 --> 21:08.335
* I just don't want no...
