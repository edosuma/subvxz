WEBVTT

00:22.600 --> 00:26.704
Aw. And that's one chipmunk
we'll never forget.

00:26.737 --> 00:29.408
In other news,
evil sorceress,
Queen of Fables,

00:29.440 --> 00:34.204
won a huge ruling today when
a judge found her imprisonment
in a US Tax Code

00:34.204 --> 00:37.229
to be cruel
and unusual punishment.

00:37.229 --> 00:39.250
[Queen of Fables]
They always use
that same damn picture.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.853
Better than the picture
they use of me.

00:41.853 --> 00:43.487
Hey, at least they're
letting you out soon.

00:43.487 --> 00:45.270
Are we still gonna get
our weekly coffees?

00:45.270 --> 00:47.625
If I'm not too busy
getting my fuck on.

00:47.658 --> 00:49.027
[both laugh]

00:49.060 --> 00:51.496
So, what's the update
with the Legion of Doom?

00:51.496 --> 00:52.963
<i>Nada.</i> Same as last week.

00:52.997 --> 00:54.698
Who do I gotta blow up
to get an invite?

00:54.731 --> 00:57.067
Easy. Find the thing
the Legion wants most,

00:57.067 --> 00:59.103
and then you get it
for yourself.

00:59.103 --> 01:02.874
All right, I've got
a two o'clock with
an independent contractor

01:02.875 --> 01:06.710
who keeps his receipts
in a fuckin' ALF lunch box.

01:08.245 --> 01:10.213
Bane, Sinestro, Grodd,

01:10.246 --> 01:11.474
I mean, even Joker.

01:11.474 --> 01:12.865
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We know what they look like.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.186
-What's your point?
-That they've all
tried and failed

01:15.188 --> 01:18.722
to steal Kord Industries'
game-changing
weather machine.

01:18.724 --> 01:20.323
Which is why
<i>we</i> are gonna do it.

01:20.358 --> 01:22.126
If none of them
could steal it,

01:22.159 --> 01:25.296
that seems like a pretty
good indicator that
we should not try.

01:25.329 --> 01:28.329
But if we succeed, it will
make the Legion so furious,

01:28.331 --> 01:30.367
they'll have to notice us.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.003
I sent Clayface
to do some recon.

01:32.037 --> 01:34.206
My character
was a sassy divorcee...

01:34.239 --> 01:37.375
Can we please not do
the unnecessary
backstory thing?

01:37.375 --> 01:39.277
-...named Brenda...
-Okay.

01:39.278 --> 01:42.445
...who is back
in the dating game
for the first time in a while,

01:42.480 --> 01:45.250
and she's decided to get
adult braces.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.950
-Of course she did.
-I know what you're thinking.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.852
It's a little expensive
on a secretary's salary,

01:48.852 --> 01:51.055
but no! You can't put
a price on a smile.

01:51.088 --> 01:53.257
So she threw caution
to the wind--

01:53.257 --> 01:56.328
Clayface! Intel!

01:56.361 --> 02:00.597
The machine is being
protected by 1,000-ish lasers,

02:00.599 --> 02:02.334
according to head scientist
Jerome Stansfield,

02:02.334 --> 02:04.668
who may or may not be
heartbroken when Brenda

02:04.701 --> 02:06.171
does not show up
to work tomorrow.

02:06.203 --> 02:09.340
How will we ever get past
1,000-ish lasers?

02:09.372 --> 02:10.908
Already thought of that.
Psycho?

02:10.909 --> 02:13.578
S.T.A.R. Labs created
a personal force field device

02:13.610 --> 02:15.045
that deflects energy.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.715
Problem is, the only
way to get into the room

02:17.748 --> 02:20.550
is through an air duct
about four inches wide.

02:20.551 --> 02:21.953
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna do that.

02:21.953 --> 02:23.621
Yeah. I thought
that might be an issue.

02:23.653 --> 02:25.222
-And?
-And I was right.

02:25.222 --> 02:26.189
It's a definite issue.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.557
[Frank] Oh, shit, Harley.

02:27.558 --> 02:29.426
The news is talking
about that book you love.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.262
Oh, Clive Cussler's
<i>Sahara?</i>

02:31.294 --> 02:33.197
Clive Cuss-- No.

02:33.197 --> 02:34.497
Queen of Fables.

02:34.498 --> 02:35.911
Oh, that's right.
She's gettin' out today.

02:35.911 --> 02:37.801
<i>We are bringing you live</i>
<i>to the courtroom</i>

02:37.802 --> 02:39.069
where Queen of Fables
is being released

02:39.104 --> 02:44.104
from her tax book prison
of 30 years.

02:44.241 --> 02:45.643
Oh, yeah.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.677
Damn! Feels good to
get out of those pages.

02:47.711 --> 02:50.114
Thanks, Zatanna.
Thanks, Judge. See ya.

02:50.146 --> 02:51.782
Whoa! What the...

02:51.816 --> 02:52.950
Watch the robe.

02:52.984 --> 02:54.718
You said you were
gonna release me!

02:54.752 --> 02:56.854
I did. From the tax code.

02:56.889 --> 03:00.691
But you're hereby sentenced
to serve the remainder of
your time in Arkham Asylum.

03:00.724 --> 03:02.693
[Harley] What?
That's bullshit!

03:02.727 --> 03:04.128
Somebody's gotta do something.

03:04.128 --> 03:06.163
She's been stuck in
that book for 30 years!

03:06.197 --> 03:08.933
[laughs] Yeah, 'cause
she almost destroyed Gotham.

03:08.967 --> 03:12.203
Yeah, I think it was more of
a lack of affordable housing
that destroyed Gotham

03:12.236 --> 03:14.906
but, look, Fables has
been a mentor to me.

03:14.938 --> 03:16.206
She just gets a bad rap.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.842
Look. Obviously,
I'm not pro-Arkham,

03:18.842 --> 03:21.879
but if there was any person
who definitely belongs there,

03:21.879 --> 03:23.515
it would be the Queen of--
Oh, my God. And you're gone.

03:23.515 --> 03:26.250
Yeah. She didn't hear
any of that shit.

03:26.282 --> 03:28.252
[laughs]

03:28.284 --> 03:31.284
[inhales and yells]

03:34.324 --> 03:35.693
How about a light, handsome?

03:35.727 --> 03:38.830
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

03:38.862 --> 03:41.399
Aw. Butterfingers.

03:41.431 --> 03:42.532
[tires screech]

03:42.567 --> 03:46.503
[crashing]

03:46.537 --> 03:47.671
Well, I'll be damned.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.841
Aw, I couldn't
leave you behind.

03:49.873 --> 03:53.411
-[beeping]
-Why, thank you, Harley.

03:53.443 --> 03:57.548
[grunts]

03:57.581 --> 03:59.382
Let's ride.

04:01.786 --> 04:05.086
[theme music playing]

04:08.558 --> 04:09.699
All right, everyone.

04:09.699 --> 04:11.930
I would like to introduce
Queen of Fables.

04:11.930 --> 04:14.132
She's agreed to help us
break into S.T.A.R. Labs.

04:14.132 --> 04:15.832
So, yeah. I'm gonna
need you to pull something

04:15.832 --> 04:17.699
around four inches tall
out of your storybook.

04:17.699 --> 04:21.105
Sure, but I'm not sure how
Prince Charming's dick
is gonna help ya.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.139
[all laughing]

04:22.139 --> 04:23.740
Kinda low hanging fruit.
Not even tryin'.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.043
I'm just playin' around.

04:25.076 --> 04:26.699
After what you did for me,

04:26.699 --> 04:28.480
you can have whatever
you need, honey.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.182
So you can pull any character
out of your storybook?

04:31.182 --> 04:32.817
Sure can.
Who's your favorite?

04:32.850 --> 04:36.319
Oh, I'm partial
to Humpty Dumpty.

04:36.353 --> 04:37.855
Hi, everybody.

04:37.889 --> 04:39.790
-Aw.
-Oh, my God. It's him!

04:39.824 --> 04:42.026
Oh, he's so-- [screams]

04:42.060 --> 04:44.295
He makes the best eggs.

04:44.329 --> 04:47.264
-Y'all got
a kitchen here, right?
-[crying]

04:47.298 --> 04:48.800
Uh, Harley. A moment?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.257
What are you thinking?

04:50.257 --> 04:52.370
Uh, that the only way to get
the Legion of Doom's attention

04:52.370 --> 04:54.170
is that weather machine,
and she's gonna help me
steal it?

04:54.204 --> 04:55.774
No, no, no, no.

04:55.807 --> 04:58.142
Seriously, you do not
want to get involved
with this bitch.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.644
She's like a real,
legit bad guy.

05:00.677 --> 05:02.146
Dude, we're all bad guys.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.848
Uh, first of all, I care
about the environment, okay?

05:04.882 --> 05:07.151
I don't know what about that
makes me a bad guy.

05:07.151 --> 05:09.552
Yeah. Says the girl who
dissolved the head of
ACE Chemicals

05:09.586 --> 05:10.887
in a bath
of his own herbicide.

05:10.922 --> 05:13.091
Best Earth Day ever.
Holla. [chuckles]

05:13.124 --> 05:15.994
Fables has been teaching me
the ropes of super villainy.

05:16.026 --> 05:18.096
You were the one saying
I should listen
to other people.

05:18.129 --> 05:20.298
No. I said
listen to me, okay?

05:20.331 --> 05:23.134
You're a bad guy
but you're a good person.

05:23.168 --> 05:25.302
Uh, I don't know, Ive.
Bad is bad.

05:25.336 --> 05:27.137
Ugh! All right,
let me try this again.

05:27.172 --> 05:29.339
You're like broadcast bad.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.608
She's cable bad.

05:31.641 --> 05:35.213
[screaming]

05:35.245 --> 05:37.314
Trust me.
You're gonna regret this.

05:37.314 --> 05:39.149
I can't listen to you
when you're dressed
like a '40s housewife

05:39.184 --> 05:40.550
who's fucking
her husband's boss.

05:40.584 --> 05:41.952
I mean,
what is with that outfit?

05:41.952 --> 05:44.488
What? Oh, I'm just...
I'm going out to...

05:44.488 --> 05:48.136
-To do environment.
-"To do environment"?

05:55.701 --> 05:57.369
Ho!

05:57.369 --> 05:59.403
Oh, God.
Is that a bouquet of roses?

05:59.403 --> 06:01.238
You realize that's like
handing me a bunch of
baby heads, right?

06:01.271 --> 06:03.776
Uh, baby heads.
With baby bodies.

06:03.810 --> 06:05.942
Guess who's one step
ahead of you?

06:05.976 --> 06:07.646
[softly] Kite Man.

06:07.646 --> 06:09.480
This is actually
very sweet of you,
what you've done here.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.088
-Yeah, you look bangin'.
-Oh, God.
You make this so hard.

06:12.088 --> 06:13.350
Okay. Are you ready?

06:13.384 --> 06:15.185
Uh, did you check out
my apartment number?

06:15.220 --> 06:17.622
[laughs] It was a 66.
I did a little flip-a-roo

06:17.656 --> 06:21.392
on that second <i>numero seis</i>
to make it real nice.

06:21.392 --> 06:23.961
This was a mistake.
We should've just met
at the motel again.

06:23.961 --> 06:25.930
-I feel like that's
more of our jam.
-No.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.833
No, I was just jokin'.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.267
I'm gonna put it back.
I'm putting it back.
I'll put it back, babe.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.170
So, you sure you don't
wanna go out for dinner?

06:32.170 --> 06:34.137
-Instead of a movie?
-What? In a public place?

06:34.172 --> 06:36.305
Yeah, I mean,
Kite Man likes to peacock.

06:36.339 --> 06:37.408
With his peahen.

06:37.442 --> 06:39.442
-That's a female peacock.
-I understood.

06:39.476 --> 06:40.911
Uh, let's do a movie.

06:40.944 --> 06:42.846
Okay? Like, definitely,
a movie is my choice.

06:42.879 --> 06:45.516
Gotcha.
Restaurant next time.

06:45.548 --> 06:46.548
Nice.

06:52.089 --> 06:55.425
Okay, Queen. You're up.

06:55.459 --> 06:58.196
Aw. He is precious.

06:58.228 --> 07:02.528
But are you sure
Cinderella's mouse
is up for the job?

07:11.475 --> 07:12.543
Ow.

07:12.543 --> 07:14.211
That answer your question?

07:14.211 --> 07:17.148
It does, but it actually
brings up a lot of
other questions.

07:17.182 --> 07:22.182
All right. We got a personal
force field to steal.

07:29.660 --> 07:33.329
The hell?

07:33.329 --> 07:34.899
Oh, shit.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.100
[announcer on PA]

07:37.134 --> 07:42.084
[people chattering
indistinctly]

Damn it, that guy
ratted us out.

07:44.543 --> 07:46.276
-I'm calling off the mission.
-Relax.

07:46.310 --> 07:49.446
You do your thing.
I'll keep them busy.

We pulled off the caper

-[Harley] Oh, shit!
-[King Shark]
This is horrifying!

08:11.235 --> 08:15.471
I won't be needing
these anymore.

08:15.505 --> 08:16.807
What did you do?

08:16.841 --> 08:18.309
I didn't do anything.

08:18.343 --> 08:21.377
All credit goes
to the Big Bad Wolf here.

08:21.377 --> 08:22.379
[growls]

08:22.379 --> 08:23.514
But why?

08:23.548 --> 08:25.916
You were there.
That guy ratted us out.

08:25.949 --> 08:27.185
So I killed that guy.

08:27.185 --> 08:28.886
Then everyone saw me
kill that guy,

08:28.886 --> 08:29.975
so I killed everyone.

08:29.975 --> 08:33.057
You gotta end
the bloodline and prevent
any revenge killing.

08:33.091 --> 08:34.458
I mean, that's just Evil 101.

08:34.491 --> 08:36.927
Uh, I taught that class
at Boston College,

08:36.927 --> 08:38.730

anything this fucked up.

All right, guys. Come on.
Take a look around.

08:41.032 --> 08:42.232
Make sure I got everyone.

08:42.267 --> 08:46.466
Make sure they're all dead.

08:47.971 --> 08:49.407
Uh, yup. Yup.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.543
You killed the shit
out of everyone. Let's go.

08:51.576 --> 08:53.547
All right. Let me grab
the Three Little Pigs
to clean this mess up.

-Come on. The bones.

09:06.323 --> 09:08.192

to get brain out of a cape.

Did she do the pig thing or...

09:13.998 --> 09:15.966
That's a yes. So...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.403
You think I was right
to be worried?

09:18.436 --> 09:20.738
Yes. Oh, my God.
Ivy, you were way right.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.407
She is... a lot.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.177
And so now you're gonna
tell her that it's...

09:26.210 --> 09:27.980
Over. Yes. I'll tell her.

09:28.013 --> 09:29.614
We'll just go back to
being friends that
do not work together.

09:29.648 --> 09:31.618
Boy, that was some fun shit,
Harley, huh?

09:31.652 --> 09:34.184
Come on. Up top.
And guess what?

09:34.217 --> 09:36.488
I decided to stick around
a little while longer.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.121
Help you get
that weather machine.

09:38.155 --> 09:40.124
[chuckles nervously]
Oh, that's too generous.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.326
I don't wanna put you out.

09:41.359 --> 09:43.327
Nonsense. This is fun.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.462
I feel like I'm gettin'
my groove back.

09:45.496 --> 09:47.365
Oh, and if you liked the pigs,

09:47.398 --> 09:50.100
wait till you see
the three blind mice
eat a body.

09:50.134 --> 09:51.802
The mice eat bodies, too?

09:51.836 --> 09:52.926
Oh, my God.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.073
Those little bastards can just
gnaw the shit out of a head.

09:56.107 --> 10:00.077
It takes longer 'cause they
got those little, you know,
mice teeth, the best!

10:00.110 --> 10:02.614
Wow. Now, that's fun,
Harley, right?

10:02.647 --> 10:04.749
That's the kinda stuff
you've got ahead of ya.

10:04.782 --> 10:06.149
[sighs and clears throat]

10:06.183 --> 10:08.221
Hey, uh, Fables?
We need to talk.

10:08.254 --> 10:10.355
Hey, everybody.
Check your shoes.

10:10.388 --> 10:12.691
Someone stepped in eye.
What's up?

10:12.724 --> 10:14.860
You know, I appreciate
how much of a badass
you are,

10:14.893 --> 10:17.596
I mean, listen, I consider you
a friend and a mentor,

10:17.629 --> 10:19.964
-and just a real--
-You know what'd be great?

10:19.996 --> 10:21.933
If you said
what you actually mean.

10:21.966 --> 10:24.369
I just... I think maybe
you should sit out the
weather machine heist.

10:24.402 --> 10:27.138
Your style, it's just
a little... intense.

10:27.171 --> 10:28.606
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:28.639 --> 10:31.042
I thought the point was
to get the job done.

10:31.075 --> 10:33.043
Yeah, but not by murdering
innocent people,

10:33.043 --> 10:34.879
I mean, it's just a line
I won't cross.

10:34.879 --> 10:37.049
Oh, you got a line, huh?

10:37.082 --> 10:39.817
Hey, guys. She has a line.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.751
Superheroes have a line.

10:41.785 --> 10:43.154
Teen Titans have a line.

10:43.187 --> 10:45.256
We don't give a fuck.

10:45.291 --> 10:49.326
Yeah, you know. I think
maybe I just give, like,
a microscopic fuck.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.464
Well, the Legion of Doom
gives zero fucks.

10:52.496 --> 10:54.231
And if you wanna get in there,

10:54.231 --> 10:56.033
you better start
pole vaulting

10:56.067 --> 10:58.436
over those lines
you don't wanna cross.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.971
Is that from <i>Mamma Mia?</i>

11:00.004 --> 11:01.371
Thank you for your counsel.

11:01.371 --> 11:03.173
But I believe this is where
we must part ways.

11:03.173 --> 11:07.504
I hope we can remain friends.

11:08.647 --> 11:10.922
Am I the only one whose
asshole's puckering.

11:10.922 --> 11:13.017
I think I clayed myself.

11:13.049 --> 11:16.052
Okay. I'll be on
my merry way.

11:16.086 --> 11:18.389
But you're makin'
a big mistake.

11:18.423 --> 11:20.357
Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin.

11:20.390 --> 11:24.591
Let's go tear some shit up.

11:25.863 --> 11:27.498
[birds chirping]

11:27.530 --> 11:29.030
Deuces.

11:31.871 --> 11:35.639
<i>Bon soir,</i> bro.
Rezzy for two.

11:35.673 --> 11:37.475
Under "Kite Man."

11:37.475 --> 11:39.778
Oh, [clicks tongue]
I'm so sorry,
<i>Monsieur</i> Kite Man,

11:39.778 --> 11:42.313
but we are a little backed up.
It will be about 40 minutes.

11:42.347 --> 11:46.551
Uh, excuse me, well then,
what's the point of making
a rezzy here, bro?

11:46.583 --> 11:48.418
I mean, I took
my lady out tonight

11:48.452 --> 11:49.955
so we can see and be seen!

11:49.988 --> 11:52.456
No, its fine. Can we just...
Can we just do the movie?

11:52.490 --> 11:54.392
-Let's do the movie.
-But hon, we're here...

11:54.424 --> 11:56.360
I wanted to take you out
for din din.

11:56.394 --> 12:00.030
Excuse me. Sir, maybe
I'm listed under "Man, Kite."

12:00.063 --> 12:02.166
Or "The Kite Man,"
sometimes that.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.467
Oh. Okay. Wait. Hang on.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.769
I know what happened here.

12:04.769 --> 12:05.769
You don't recognize me
without the kite.

12:05.770 --> 12:07.938
[grunts]

12:07.972 --> 12:10.808
-I'm sorry there.
-I think put the kite
away maybe?

12:10.841 --> 12:13.076
Well, that's actually
easier said than done.

12:13.110 --> 12:16.260
Um, somebody got
an Allen key?

12:20.017 --> 12:21.618
[grunts]

12:21.652 --> 12:26.524
[grunts]

12:26.557 --> 12:27.692
Hey, what's he doing here?

12:27.725 --> 12:29.326
I thought he was
loyal to Fable.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.796
He's a mercenary,
loyal to the almighty dollar.

12:31.830 --> 12:36.830
An adorable little soldier
of fortune, isn't he?

12:38.236 --> 12:41.371
Huh. I thought you said
this thing was protected
by a bunch of lasers?

12:41.405 --> 12:43.990
That's what
the blueprints said.

12:49.013 --> 12:50.513
[beeping]

12:54.851 --> 12:55.851
[squeaks]

12:58.399 --> 12:59.167
Oh, there they are.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.759
Look. If it wasn't lasers,
it was gonna be lung cancer.

13:01.793 --> 13:04.261
I have never seen
a mouse smoke unfiltered,

13:04.261 --> 13:06.063
human-sized cigarettes
to that degree.

13:06.097 --> 13:08.732
Okay, guys, y'know,
if my body gets
diced up by lasers,

13:08.732 --> 13:10.601
I don't know, you do
something fun with it,

13:10.601 --> 13:12.470
like mail my ear
to a random family

13:12.470 --> 13:13.705
and say,
"We have your daughter."

13:13.705 --> 13:16.394
You know,
something like that.

13:21.778 --> 13:24.178
[guns whirring]

13:34.893 --> 13:38.462
Hello, Legion of Doom.

13:38.495 --> 13:39.785
[Harley] That's right, Mayor.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.966
We'll raise the temperature
of Gotham by one degree

13:42.000 --> 13:44.268
every minute till ya give us
a billion dollars!

13:44.302 --> 13:45.465
[Clayface whispering]

13:45.465 --> 13:47.606
And you produce Clayface's
<i>Fuller House</i> reboot...

13:47.640 --> 13:49.307
<i>Fullest House.</i>

13:49.307 --> 13:50.542
I have an inexpensive way in...

13:50.542 --> 13:53.077
Not more people.
A smaller house.

13:53.110 --> 13:55.312
<i>You know what you</i>
<i>and your crew are, Ms. Quinn?</i>

13:55.346 --> 13:56.614
<i>A scourge.</i>

13:56.614 --> 13:58.282
Hey, look at that,
the Mayor upgraded us

13:58.282 --> 13:59.551
from nuisance to "scourge"!

13:59.583 --> 14:01.421
Ooh, we skipped over "menace"?

14:01.453 --> 14:03.200
That's a big jump.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.190
That's what happens
when ya steal the unstealable.

14:05.224 --> 14:07.258
[Queen of Fables]
Thanks for doing that,
by the way.

14:07.291 --> 14:10.000
I'll be taking that
weather machine now.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Hey, Mayor,
I'll call ya back.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.575
You fucked up, Harley.

14:12.575 --> 14:14.764
Y'know, I do a lot of that,
so you're gonna have to be
more specific.

14:14.798 --> 14:15.933
You pissed me off

14:15.966 --> 14:18.635
and then let me
walk away in one piece?

14:18.669 --> 14:20.971
Rookie mistake,
right, Big Bad?

14:20.971 --> 14:21.971
[growls]

14:21.971 --> 14:23.274
I can't believe
you're doing this.

14:23.274 --> 14:24.975
I broke you out of Arkham!

14:25.000 --> 14:28.044
I even helped ya sign up
for Tinder so ya can get
your fuck on.

14:28.044 --> 14:29.259
I mean, we're friends!

14:29.259 --> 14:32.517
Sometimes doing
whatever it takes means
fucking over your friends.

14:32.549 --> 14:34.217
Hand over that weather machine.

14:34.251 --> 14:36.120
Over my dead body.

14:36.153 --> 14:37.753
All right. How you wanna go?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.424
Little Bo Peep could beat
the shit outta ya with
her shepherd's stick.

14:40.457 --> 14:42.960
Just tell me if you want
casket open or closed.

14:42.993 --> 14:45.962
[all grunt]

14:45.995 --> 14:47.365
[electricity crackling]

14:47.398 --> 14:49.166
What the hell kinda
fairy tale is he from?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.534
Well, from the looks of him,

14:50.534 --> 14:52.269
one of those Danish ones
that's super racist.

14:52.269 --> 14:54.970
He's not with me.

14:57.575 --> 15:00.578
Um, anyone have
another magical storybook?

15:00.613 --> 15:05.613
Shit, I mean, is there
a B. Dalton or a Waldenbooks
in this motherfucker?

15:06.182 --> 15:08.052
[all yelling]

15:08.085 --> 15:09.253
Who the hell are you?

15:09.287 --> 15:12.390
-I am Jason Praxis.
-Who?

15:12.423 --> 15:17.861
Last surviving member
of the 25th Annual Praxis
Family Reunion and Jamboree.

15:17.861 --> 15:21.164
-Who?
-You murdered
all of my family!

15:21.197 --> 15:22.767
[all] Oh, shit.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.102
-Yeah, I did that.
-[yells]

15:25.136 --> 15:28.706
Uh, hey, yeah,
I'm just checkin' to see
if my buzzer is broken

15:28.740 --> 15:31.207
'cause you said it'd be
45 minutes and
it's been 40...

15:31.241 --> 15:33.043
Oh. It's been 47.

15:33.076 --> 15:34.544
I've got a riddle for you.

15:34.578 --> 15:36.981
Who's hungry, but doesn't
have a reservation?

15:37.014 --> 15:40.150
<i>Monsieur</i> Riddler,
looking well.
Right this way.

15:40.150 --> 15:40.846
[Riddler laughs]

15:40.846 --> 15:43.855
Y'know what, it's cool.
Let's just... Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

15:43.888 --> 15:45.756
Uh, maybe you could
just drop your name.

15:45.756 --> 15:48.058
-I mean, is it weird
for me to...
-Yeah, a little bit.

15:48.058 --> 15:50.562
-I'd rather just not do that...
-Totally get it.

15:50.596 --> 15:54.065
-Yeah. I mean,
you're a very humble person.
-No! Don't... Do not...

15:54.099 --> 15:57.299
-Do not do that.
-Whoa. Babe, did you used to
work here or something?

15:57.301 --> 15:58.735
Did you fuck the manager?

15:58.769 --> 16:01.808
No judgement if ya did.
Kite Man is very secure.

16:01.842 --> 16:04.274
-Great.
-Wait.

16:04.307 --> 16:06.409
The sunglasses, the hat...

16:06.443 --> 16:08.113
Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?

16:08.145 --> 16:11.581
-Can we talk about this
somewhere else?
-Oh, my God.

16:11.615 --> 16:13.650
-No.
-You are embarrassed.

16:13.684 --> 16:16.320
Is there even lingerie
under that trench coat?

16:16.354 --> 16:18.923
-Kite Man, look.
-No, you Kite Man look.

16:18.956 --> 16:20.725
You think I'm some
D-list piece of shit

16:20.758 --> 16:22.726
that went to REI
and bought a hang-glider.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.129
I don't think that...

16:24.129 --> 16:25.797
But I mean, that is
what happened, right?

16:25.797 --> 16:29.265
Oh, I'm sorry
I can't make plants

16:29.299 --> 16:32.202
do all sorts of shit
with my mind.

16:32.235 --> 16:34.239
We can't all be Poison Ivy!

16:34.272 --> 16:37.274
Look! The table's ready.
Let's just... Let's go eat.

16:37.307 --> 16:38.610
I believe I've lost
my appetite.

16:38.610 --> 16:39.878
Kite Man, please don't do this.

16:39.878 --> 16:42.878
You're the one doing
the "this."

16:51.522 --> 16:53.625
Ah! I thought you ended
the bloodline?

16:53.625 --> 16:56.163
I didn't leave anyone alive.
Did you see anyone alive?

16:56.196 --> 16:59.630
-Eh...
-"Eh"? What is "Eh"?

16:59.663 --> 17:02.667
I may have seen
one person left alive.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.602
What? How long
have you been sittin'

17:04.635 --> 17:06.436
on this little nugget
of information?

17:06.471 --> 17:08.772
It was nothin'.
It was just a little girl...

17:08.807 --> 17:13.443
With like a blonde...
ponytail.

17:13.478 --> 17:14.711
Oh, shit.

17:14.746 --> 17:18.249
And that's why
you always end the what?

17:18.281 --> 17:19.584
[all] The bloodline.

17:19.616 --> 17:22.553
The motherfucking
bloodline. Yes!

17:22.586 --> 17:24.756
My family was close.

17:24.788 --> 17:26.723
Not Appalachian
hillbilly close,

17:26.758 --> 17:28.259
but we leaned
on each other.

17:28.291 --> 17:31.262
We made each other laugh.

17:31.296 --> 17:33.730
<i>That all changed</i>
<i>when you showed up.</i>

17:48.814 --> 17:53.284
<i>I threw myself against</i>

but instead
of killing me, it...

-Gave him powers.
-It gave me powers!

17:58.190 --> 18:01.526
Every goddamn time.
And now he wants to--

18:01.558 --> 18:03.862
I seek revenge!

18:03.894 --> 18:05.997
-That.
-Is there anythin' we can do
to make this right?

18:06.030 --> 18:09.666
Not unless you can bring
my family back from the dead.

18:09.701 --> 18:11.938
Hang on. Lemme check.
Anyone?

18:11.971 --> 18:15.640
Yeah, no, we can't do that.
Your second choice?

18:15.673 --> 18:18.222
Kill all of you!

18:21.145 --> 18:23.080
Ooh, I didn't even know
he could do that.

18:23.114 --> 18:26.050
I should tell you
I woke up this morning
with a post-nasal thing,

18:26.084 --> 18:29.420
drank a lot of cough syrup
and I can't hold this
much longer.

18:29.452 --> 18:31.756
Is there a third choice,
Mr. Praxis?

18:31.788 --> 18:35.926
Hand over Queen of Fables
and the rest of you can live.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.830
All right. Let's come up
with a plan here.

18:37.864 --> 18:40.631
-Already got one.
-Hey, what the--

18:40.664 --> 18:45.315
I'm comin' out
with the Queen.

18:45.805 --> 18:48.573
She's all yours.

18:53.426 --> 18:55.881
Look, I got you a real nine.
[chuckles nervously]

18:55.881 --> 19:00.785
So you don't have to, like,
turn your six upside down
to make the, you know, 69.

-[groans]
-[sighs]

19:01.986 --> 19:03.855

I'm here to apologize.

19:03.887 --> 19:06.523
-Apology accepted.
-That wasn't the apology part.

19:06.557 --> 19:08.291
Oh, right. Then by
all means, continue.

19:08.325 --> 19:09.325
Okay.

19:09.325 --> 19:12.096
I am genuinely sorry for how
I acted at the restaurant.

19:12.130 --> 19:14.965
I mean, I pretend like
I'm this like badass

19:14.999 --> 19:16.733
who doesn't care
what people think, but...

19:16.733 --> 19:17.894
But you do.

19:17.894 --> 19:19.571
Right, which is why
I said "I pretend."

19:19.571 --> 19:22.106
No, no, no, I get it.

19:22.140 --> 19:26.176
When you have a superpower
like being able to control
all plant life,

19:26.211 --> 19:30.214
or having a kite,
there's just so much
you gotta live up to.

19:30.248 --> 19:33.384
I love that you think that
that's a power.

19:33.416 --> 19:34.919
Y'know, it's great.

19:34.952 --> 19:37.623
I wish I had that kind of
insane level of confidence.

19:37.655 --> 19:40.857
It's like, you genuinely
do not care what other
people think.

19:40.892 --> 19:42.660
I care about what you think.

19:42.692 --> 19:44.528
Aw, that's really
sweet of you to say.

19:44.561 --> 19:46.900
And... I care about dat ass.

19:46.932 --> 19:51.268
Okay. Look, you're not
traditionally the kind
of dude I date.

19:51.301 --> 19:52.769
Y'know, you're just not.

19:52.769 --> 19:57.106
But against all logic
and reason, I do like you.

19:57.141 --> 19:58.644
Like, like-like?

19:58.676 --> 20:00.912
-I mean, we've had sex.
-Nice.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.513
-[door opens]
-Oh, hey.
This is my roommate Bill,

20:03.548 --> 20:05.183
AKA the Bill-doe.

20:05.218 --> 20:07.551
Hey. I'm Ivy.

20:07.585 --> 20:10.453
I'm... I'm his girlfriend.

20:10.488 --> 20:11.906
Hell, yeah.

20:12.959 --> 20:18.163
I'm gonna send your ass
to the happily never after,
Fables!

20:18.163 --> 20:20.463
-[laughs]
-Seriously? You liked that?

20:20.498 --> 20:22.701
Indeed. Terse. Lucid.

20:22.736 --> 20:26.503
Organically wove the theme
of his target into the barb!

20:26.537 --> 20:27.703
A triumph!

20:27.703 --> 20:28.740
I'm gonna get
some more cough syrup.

20:28.772 --> 20:29.973
C'mon, Harley,

20:30.008 --> 20:31.875
you don't have it
in you to do this.

20:31.910 --> 20:33.744
You have a "line," remember?

20:33.778 --> 20:37.249
Yeah. That's what
I used to think, too.

20:37.281 --> 20:40.432
For House... Praxis!

20:42.619 --> 20:44.654
[grunts]

20:44.689 --> 20:46.089
'Ey, guess what?

20:46.089 --> 20:47.291
You're not dead.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.492
Force field, baby!
I slipped it on your wrist.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.127
Damn. You set me up.

20:51.161 --> 20:52.364
You tricky bitch.

20:52.396 --> 20:54.266
I would never send
a friend to her death,

20:54.298 --> 20:56.500
even one that
tried to screw me over.

20:56.534 --> 20:58.702
So, you're just gonna
let me go?

20:58.702 --> 21:00.003
Yeah. I got
the weather machine.

21:00.038 --> 21:02.006
I won and I did it my way.

21:02.006 --> 21:04.240
I'm a bad guy,
not a bad person.

21:04.275 --> 21:05.568
You're a dumb person.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.378
You're gonna regret
letting me walk out
of here alive, Quinn.

21:08.412 --> 21:10.464
Don't forget your little book.

21:12.516 --> 21:14.094
[groans]

21:14.094 --> 21:17.023
Oh, no. He's waking up
and I cannot deal with
awkward situations.

21:17.057 --> 21:19.757
D-Did I vanquish her?

21:19.790 --> 21:22.393
Please, tell me
I avenged my family?

21:22.425 --> 21:24.327
Uh, yeah?

21:24.361 --> 21:25.563
Thank God.

21:25.596 --> 21:28.365
[sniffles]
I can finally start...

21:28.398 --> 21:30.567
-[screams]
-Fables!

21:30.601 --> 21:32.502
-Why?
-[laughs]

21:32.536 --> 21:34.204
Oh, my goodness.

21:34.239 --> 21:37.075
Can you believe,
with all that
ending-the-bloodline talk,

21:37.107 --> 21:41.907
I almost forgot
this guy? Jeez.

21:42.378 --> 21:44.648
All right, now I'm going.

21:44.682 --> 21:46.549
So what did I miss?

21:46.584 --> 21:50.483
Oh, my God!
A lot, I guess.

21:51.489 --> 21:52.623
[machine beeping]

21:52.656 --> 21:55.192
[Clayface]
Try "NeilPatrickHarris1."

21:55.226 --> 21:58.729
Clayface, is that
your personal password?

21:58.762 --> 22:00.097
-No.
-Okay.

22:00.131 --> 22:02.532
-[beeping]
-Well, it doesn't
work anyway.

22:02.566 --> 22:04.035
So, lemme just
get this straight.

22:04.067 --> 22:06.605
You went through two heists,
sacrificed a family

22:06.637 --> 22:10.775
and that weird electric guy
just to steal an unstealable
weather machine,

22:10.775 --> 22:12.643
but didn't realize that
you needed a password?

22:12.643 --> 22:14.444
Ooh, unstealable! Try that.

22:14.478 --> 22:16.000
[beeping]

22:16.000 --> 22:17.848
[computer]
<i>Too many failed</i>
<i>log in attempts.</i>

22:17.882 --> 22:21.451
<i>Initiating self-destruct.</i>

22:21.484 --> 22:23.520
Oh, shit.

22:23.554 --> 22:28.554
