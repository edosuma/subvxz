00:07.616 --> 00:11.228
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...

00:11.272 --> 00:13.752
- Did Marion send you?
- Who?

00:13.796 --> 00:15.537
Marion, the boy's mother.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.062
Last time I saw her she was
on about some monkey army.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.195
- James?
- Hello.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.155
Primaries, we see everything...

00:25.199 --> 00:26.461
Past, present, future.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.246
We help time think.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.987
Climb the steps, ring the bell.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.251
Whatever these are,
these symbols,

00:34.295 --> 00:37.298
this is your mission now.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.865
We shall destroy our enemies
where they live.

00:39.909 --> 00:43.130
You wanted the Witness
to return.

00:44.435 --> 00:47.134
She has!

00:55.446 --> 00:57.361
What I am about to tell you

00:57.405 --> 01:01.017
is the legend
as it was told to me.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.889
There was once a serpent

01:03.933 --> 01:06.588
who only traveled one direction.

01:06.631 --> 01:10.635
Always forward, never backwards.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.594
Until one day,

01:12.637 --> 01:16.293
the serpent came upon a demon.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.169
Stop!

01:37.662 --> 01:39.664
Whoa! Whoa!

01:58.553 --> 02:00.468
I'm sure you will not
be surprised to know

02:00.511 --> 02:05.560
we've seen your coming
for some time.

02:05.603 --> 02:10.826
Heretics. Witches and warlocks.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.610
Primaries.

02:18.050 --> 02:22.751
Where is the weapon?

02:24.056 --> 02:27.190
You have no idea.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.210
Are you foolish enough
to believe

02:47.254 --> 02:50.561
we did not foresee this?

02:50.605 --> 02:54.304
We fear not this end.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.568
We've already covered ourselves
in oil.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.468
Hush, child. It's okay.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.730
I can hear them.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.386
They're screaming.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.257
Chorus, listen to me.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.563
There isn't much time.

03:35.606 --> 03:39.393
You must take this now.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.834
I can no longer keep it for you.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.836
It is yours to bear.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.757
The legend...

03:55.800 --> 03:57.933
This...

03:57.976 --> 04:01.415
And the name.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.507
James Cole.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.316
The wound's too deep.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.928
Lost too much time.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.061
Mr. Cole!

04:47.243 --> 04:48.505
That's all you can do.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.550
Kill yourself.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.812
I want to go home.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.771
I'm sending you back to 2017.

04:53.815 --> 04:58.080
Climb the steps, ring the bell.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.995
I'm afraid I can't leave you
here unattended.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.606
I understand.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.478
What about Adler?

05:04.521 --> 05:06.654
He's out, but stable.

05:06.697 --> 05:09.265
That is not a woman.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.180
It's a chameleon.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.095
And if she smiles at you,

05:13.138 --> 05:14.662
it's because she wants you dead.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
Time to go!

05:26.238 --> 05:27.346
Wish I could've known you.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.545
Another life.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.903
They're coming for us.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.517
Cassie.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.954
What do I do?

05:47.695 --> 05:50.872
Cassie, show me. I can help.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.178
I don't think
she's going to make it.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.836
Jones?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.799
- Cassie.
- I'm not a trauma surgeon.

06:04.842 --> 06:08.890
A wound like this is too deep.
I can't just fix it.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.761
Can't or won't?

06:14.112 --> 06:15.112
Jones...

06:17.072 --> 06:19.117
Athan!

06:19.161 --> 06:20.989
I am sorry about Athan.

06:21.032 --> 06:24.601
She would be too
if she could say it.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.430
Would she?

06:27.474 --> 06:29.650
Please.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.657
Yeah, you can throw blame around

06:36.700 --> 06:37.938
all you like, but you're a boy.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.574
Athan wasn't the Witness.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.576
It's always been Olivia.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.316
And right now, we need
to be ready.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.990
She knows where we are,
she knows when we are.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.537
Jesus Christ.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.712
How long do we have?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.497
Hours, minutes.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.455
The Titan belongs to her now.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.417
K... k... ka.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.470
Cassie!

07:15.913 --> 07:19.439
Get adrenaline. If I can't
start her heart manually...

07:19.482 --> 07:22.616
One, two, three, four...

07:35.150 --> 07:38.109
13, 14, 15, 16,

07:38.153 --> 07:42.984
17, 18, 19, 20.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.399
What are you doing?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.377
You said it yourself.
We have to get out of here.

08:09.401 --> 08:12.013
No, I said we should
be ready. Where would we go?

08:12.056 --> 08:12.970
Anywhere.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.885
Any whenbut here.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.018
We're not fixing anything.
We're making it worse.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.628
- No.
- It's over, Cole.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.543
- We lost.
- Not yet. W...

08:20.587 --> 08:22.371
I'm not talking about the fight.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.726
We saved him.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.908
Maybe not his life,
but who he was.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.780
What he could've been.

08:39.823 --> 08:43.000
I almost let Jones die.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.873
I wanted her to.

08:45.916 --> 08:51.531
We may have saved Athan's soul,
but I am losing mine.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.055
Maybe if we go, they'll all go.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.274
Not everybody has to die today.

09:00.627 --> 09:04.500
Last time we gave up was '57.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.156
And then the storms came.

09:08.199 --> 09:11.507
It was only a moment.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.857
It was the best of my life.

09:13.901 --> 09:17.252
The future will find us.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.907
It always does.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.736
Maybe now needs to be enough.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.433
You want to run.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.087
Far and fast.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.524
All of us,
in different directions.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.831
We each find a place
in the past.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.573
Yeah, but for how long?

09:33.616 --> 09:35.052
As long as we get.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.016
The core is overheating.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.975
Critical levels.
The cooling system.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.761
The underground river...
Something's happening to it.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.458
- What?
- Don't know.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.661
But if we can't stop it,
none of us are going anywhere.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.386
Holy shit.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.783
Hell's going on down there?

10:09.826 --> 10:12.002
The river is boiling.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.656
What the hell would cause that?

10:36.548 --> 10:38.725
She's here.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.017
We have arrived.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.453
Hours after your escape,

11:11.496 --> 11:13.803
and moments after their return.

11:13.847 --> 11:18.155
Your causality is intact.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.984
How do you wish to proceed?

11:21.028 --> 11:23.900
Simply.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.773
Kill them all.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.297
The Witness has spoken.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.650
All right.
There's only one way in.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.652
We choke off the entrance,
take 'em out.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.263
Stick with the science, man.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.396
Lasky, just fix the core.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.919
Otherwise, we got
no way out of here.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.312
If they get past us...

11:44.355 --> 11:45.313
I got his back.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.010
Let's go.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.368
Now!

12:52.119 --> 12:53.685
Why do you need
a radiation suit?

12:53.729 --> 12:56.079
To cool the core manually.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.780
But I have to stabilize
the machine first.

13:00.823 --> 13:04.348
K... k... Charon...

13:04.392 --> 13:06.829
- Charon...
- Charon.

13:06.873 --> 13:10.833
Charon...

13:10.877 --> 13:13.836
Project Charon.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.055
Escape.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.971
Escape? How?

13:18.014 --> 13:22.279
We splinter everything.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.586
But it's not finished.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.806
It's our only chance.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.850
There's too many!

14:10.893 --> 14:13.417
Cole, get down here.
We may have a way out.

14:13.461 --> 14:17.291
Fall back!

14:32.523 --> 14:34.830
Lay down those claymores
and seal the door.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.484
Nothing gets in.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.056
Project...

14:43.099 --> 14:45.101
Charon...

14:45.145 --> 14:48.104
We'll splinter the facility.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.801
Most of it.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.020
Where?

14:51.064 --> 14:52.674
Somewhere safe.

14:52.717 --> 14:56.330
Time travel
without the "time" part.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.071
How?

14:58.114 --> 15:01.596
An adaptation of Titan's
splinter array.

15:01.639 --> 15:06.209
We modified Elliot Jones'
early machine prototypes.

15:06.253 --> 15:09.430
These points are repeaters.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.171
They disperse the beam

15:11.214 --> 15:14.000
across the lower facility
to create a perimeter.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.958
Everything inside the beams
comes with us.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.352
Everything else...
These sections here...

15:18.395 --> 15:19.744
They stay behind.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.200
What if Olivia's men
cross the beams?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.486
They could just hitch a ride.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.966
The beams are highly amplified.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.054
They could try,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.229
but they'd combust.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.970
Painful death on contact.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.189
I like it.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.060
I knew the Titan

15:31.104 --> 15:32.453
would come someday.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.499
But if we could be like Titan...

15:35.543 --> 15:37.327
We could save everyone.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.547
It's theoretical at best.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.897
Even if the core
wasn't unstable...

15:41.941 --> 15:44.987
We've never tested
those repeaters.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.597
It's not ready.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.210
Will it work?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.603
Trust me.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.480
One last time.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.441
We'd have to pull
people we can't spare

16:04.485 --> 16:05.747
from a wall we can't defend

16:05.790 --> 16:07.401
with time we don't have.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.924
What's the choice? Right now,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.752
we're taking on a fortress
with a BB gun.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.425
Then we need something
to buy us some time

16:12.449 --> 16:14.016
to get these in place.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.975
We need a hammer.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.848
A big one.

17:17.992 --> 17:18.992
Timber.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.413
Clever.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.546
Can our towers turn outward?

17:49.590 --> 17:53.028
Yes. Why?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.551
Katarina Jones

17:54.595 --> 17:58.033
taught me the many uses
of temporal energy.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.950
We'll move through space,
not time.

18:01.993 --> 18:05.171
Turn our towers
toward their facility.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.868
Splinter it apart.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.218
But why here, of all places?

18:09.262 --> 18:12.047
Where else would prey go,

18:12.091 --> 18:14.267
but underground?

18:14.310 --> 18:15.659
I'll call the men back.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.531
No. Stay on the offensive.

18:17.574 --> 18:21.187
This war ends today.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.380
They're inside?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.262
Guys...

19:36.305 --> 19:37.959
New problem.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.788
Olivia's got herself
a Death Star.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.486
Get your ass back here, now.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.009
The coordinates are set.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.620
I just need to get the core
back online.

19:46.663 --> 19:47.969
We can't splinter without it.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.579
Lasky!

20:06.335 --> 20:07.728
Lasky's dead.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.208
Someone get to the core.

21:07.396 --> 21:10.051
Jones!

21:10.094 --> 21:11.792
Jones.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.316
I need to cool the core.
Manually.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.926
Or we'll never splinter
out of here.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.319
The radiation will kill you.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.886
Not today.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.334
I'll buy you as much time
as I can.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.729
Go.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.387
Where's Mother?

22:35.658 --> 22:37.443
The core's stable.

22:37.486 --> 22:38.966
Start the sequence.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.359
We need to splinter now.

22:40.402 --> 22:44.406
Everyone get inside
the perimeter.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.942
Marcus.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.255
Was it enough?

23:07.298 --> 23:09.083
Yes.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.631
Don't you assholes
leave without me!

23:35.675 --> 23:38.852
Deacon.

23:38.895 --> 23:44.031
I'm at the controls.
What do I do?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.468
Someone talk to me, please.

23:48.731 --> 23:49.950
Hannah...

23:49.993 --> 23:51.604
Mother...

23:51.647 --> 23:53.693
Do exactly as I say.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.358
Deacon!

24:52.403 --> 24:54.884
Don't leave me.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.934
We have to go.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.109
Now.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.676
We can't leave him.

25:03.719 --> 25:06.330
We already have.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.941
Come on!

25:35.011 --> 25:38.798
Their cycle has ended.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.061
A new one begins.

25:54.422 --> 26:00.167
All living things
can travel through time.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.213
It's simple, really.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.086
Just wait a moment.

26:06.129 --> 26:10.960
And then another, and another.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.093
Do this often enough,
and you will have arrived

26:13.136 --> 26:15.748
at tomorrow.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.272
Enough tomorrows,

26:18.315 --> 26:20.840
and you'll be dead,

26:20.883 --> 26:24.713
adrift without power
or patience.

26:24.757 --> 26:29.239
At the very end of time,
you'll ask yourself,

26:29.283 --> 26:32.286
"Where am I right now,

26:32.329 --> 26:34.418
and what have I done?"

26:34.462 --> 26:37.247
Stay with me.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.339
You'll have grown old.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.385
You will have hoped

26:44.428 --> 26:47.649
and let go of hope.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.913
You will have tried

26:50.957 --> 26:53.133
and you will have failed.

27:03.143 --> 27:06.668
Shaped by time until you
are that,

27:06.712 --> 27:09.976
which you are not meant,
nor wished, to be.

27:10.019 --> 27:13.066
You may be left
with someone you love

27:13.109 --> 27:16.460
and all the horrible things
you've done for them.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.644
Until finally,

27:25.687 --> 27:28.211
you will lose
the very last thing

27:28.255 --> 27:30.692
you had left.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.477
Yourself.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.514
The Emerson.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.217
Jones surveyed this place
in '44,

28:17.260 --> 28:21.482
when she went Ramse back
to get us.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.790
She knew we could make
the landing.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.705
She saved us.

28:26.748 --> 28:29.751
We're not saved.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.101
This is us going in circles.

29:42.519 --> 29:46.567
Damn it!

29:46.610 --> 29:48.264
Still not enough power?

29:48.308 --> 29:50.919
You could bring
a hundred generators

29:50.963 --> 29:53.400
and it still wouldn't
give us enough power

29:53.443 --> 29:56.533
to re-fire the machine.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.361
Without a working core...

29:58.405 --> 29:59.841
So fix it.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.974
We need another Adam Cell
to kick-start it.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.976
To get one of those...

30:04.019 --> 30:07.414
You. Need. A time machine.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.373
Jones have any thoughts?

30:12.767 --> 30:16.336
None that she's willing
to share.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.184
Housekeeping dropped the ball?

30:57.899 --> 30:59.770
What's this?

31:03.774 --> 31:06.516
They're Jennifer's.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.432
She splintered back here
after Jones let her loose.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.925
What's that?

31:28.103 --> 31:31.063
There once was a serpent
who only traveled...

31:31.106 --> 31:33.761
In one direction.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.937
Always forward, never backward.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.814
I know this.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.952
It's an ouroboros.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.519
Many cultures have it.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.347
Jennifer often drew that.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.870
Sometimes waking
from a nightmare.

31:55.914 --> 31:56.958
Why?

31:57.002 --> 31:58.351
Why did she draw it?

31:58.394 --> 32:00.657
She called it "the end
and the beginning."

32:00.701 --> 32:03.965
The secret to the universe
is chock full of nuts.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.445
What are you talking about?

32:05.488 --> 32:07.490
The future me said

32:07.534 --> 32:08.970
that there was an end
to all this,

32:09.014 --> 32:10.450
that Jennifer was the key,

32:10.493 --> 32:11.906
that she had the answer
to everything.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.366
She did.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.977
Guardians. Athan.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.326
No, there's more than that.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.502
Ms. Goines
wanted to return to her time.

32:19.546 --> 32:20.677
2017.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.201
Well, we need to find her.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.787
Get the machine
back up and running again.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.683
We can't.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.076
God damn it.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.686
Dr. Railly's right,
it's impossible.

32:29.730 --> 32:33.560
We're not giving up!

32:33.603 --> 32:35.127
Mr. Cole.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.564
We need the core
to get the machine to work.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.522
We had two.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.002
The broken one,

32:41.046 --> 32:44.832
and the one we slaughtered
Spearhead for.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.660
We use the old to fix the new.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.314
The old core was in storage.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.055
Outside the splinter perimeter.

32:50.098 --> 32:52.492
Which means
we know it'll be there.

32:52.535 --> 32:55.321
Crushed under the rest of
the facility we left behind.

32:55.364 --> 32:56.931
Well, there's one way to know.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.585
Go back to Raritan?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.761
It's way too dangerous.
We lost enough...

33:00.804 --> 33:02.850
Deacon.

33:02.893 --> 33:06.506
Whitley, Lasky...

33:06.549 --> 33:09.422
Athan.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.554
They died for us.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.165
For this mission!

33:15.776 --> 33:19.214
Cole. There is no mission.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.044
It's over.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.604
Anything else?

34:01.648 --> 34:03.084
No, thanks.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.859
Anytime, amigo.

35:22.903 --> 35:27.473
Roger, roger.
Initiate shock and awe.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.479
Before you now, the ouroboros.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.959
The ancient universal depiction

35:36.003 --> 35:38.788
of the beginning and the end.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.922
The self-eating snake,
to many cultures,

35:41.965 --> 35:44.881
represents
a song of inevitability.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.754
Of fate, inescapable.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.886
To the psychologist,

35:49.930 --> 35:51.850
it is our shared understanding
of life and death.

36:06.207 --> 36:09.167
From ancient Egypt
to Athens, Greece...

36:18.567 --> 36:21.527
Yes! Thomas Crown
ain't got nothing on us.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.398
Quiet. I'm working.

36:23.442 --> 36:26.096
So am I.

36:28.969 --> 36:33.016
There it is, Looney Tunes.

36:33.060 --> 36:36.324
Here we go.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.380
Booyah.

36:48.423 --> 36:51.034
Got it?

36:51.992 --> 36:53.820
Pressure alarm. Shit.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.517
I need an exfil. Right. Got it.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.911
What's an exfil?

37:01.131 --> 37:03.699
Shit.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.005
Hand over the artifact.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.225
- Did someone find you?
- Yeah.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.530
I got this.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.097
This guy...

37:10.140 --> 37:11.533
is history.

37:11.577 --> 37:12.578
Is that a catchphrase?

37:12.621 --> 37:14.275
Maybe.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.059
Abort catchphrase!

37:16.103 --> 37:17.452
No...

37:28.942 --> 37:31.292
Holy shit!
How are you so awesome?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.120
You tell me.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.921
I got this. This guy is history.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.315
Was that a catchphrase? Maybe.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.404
Abort catchphrase!

38:00.234 --> 38:01.670
Oof!

38:01.714 --> 38:03.716
How is she so awesome?

38:03.759 --> 38:07.197
I don't know. You tell me.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.783
What do I care?

38:27.827 --> 38:29.959
The world's ending anyway?

38:30.003 --> 38:32.440
Wouldn't sweat it,
Czech-y Cheese.

38:32.484 --> 38:36.052
I'm just here to do my part.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.358
In what?

38:39.534 --> 38:41.188
Saving it.

38:47.847 --> 38:50.284
Americans.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.701
Hey! Action Jackson.
Where are you?

39:15.744 --> 39:17.224
On my way in.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.052
Hurry up!
It's almost curfew time.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.575
Chillax, Nutter Butters.

39:20.619 --> 39:21.837
"Chillax"?

39:21.881 --> 39:23.404
Okay, this voice needs work.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.580
Hey, we just crushed
a museum heist, kiddo.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.190
Enjoy the moment.

39:37.157 --> 39:41.422
I got it.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.642
That's it.

39:43.685 --> 39:44.773
Yeah.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.427
Just what we needed.

39:46.471 --> 39:50.910
More useless shit
to spruce up the place.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.739
"Rescue me. She's a hoarder."

39:55.436 --> 39:58.439
Imaginary friends
aren't supposed to be dicks.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.919
Yeah, yeah.

39:59.962 --> 40:02.835
Just bustin' your balls, psycho.

40:02.878 --> 40:07.056
Where does this voice
even come from?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.189
Primary magic and movie popcorn.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.712
Extra butter.

40:10.756 --> 40:11.800
The bucket.

40:11.844 --> 40:13.149
Candy combo.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.934
Yeah.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.283
All right, kiddo.

40:16.326 --> 40:19.286
You wanted it, you got it,

40:19.329 --> 40:20.287
now what the hell
are we going to do

40:20.330 --> 40:21.331
with this thing?

40:27.163 --> 40:29.383
I don't know.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.041
It's important somehow.

40:35.084 --> 40:36.956
It's meant for us.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.132
Meant for you.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.482
You saw it. Athan saw it.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.005
It's the key to everything.

40:43.049 --> 40:45.225
Now,

40:45.268 --> 40:48.968
just need to find the door.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.146
And the name?

40:53.189 --> 40:54.321
James Cole.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.018
James Cole...

41:09.815 --> 41:12.034
Just come out already.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.215
How long have you known?

41:19.259 --> 41:21.609
A couple miles.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.785
I thought if I ignored you,
you'd give up,

41:23.829 --> 41:25.831
but I should've known
you'd be too stubborn.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.486
Mother would say
we have that in common.

41:30.749 --> 41:33.099
May I walk with you?

41:33.142 --> 41:34.927
What for?

41:36.406 --> 41:38.974
So that you do not walk alone?

41:42.717 --> 41:44.502
We're close.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.112
What if Titan is still there?

41:46.155 --> 41:47.635
Won't be. It's been months.

41:47.679 --> 41:51.247
Don't bother. She's mental.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.945
Scavs.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.164
Save my soul, remember?

41:55.208 --> 41:57.863
Yes. Too late,
'cause I'm going back.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.429
Your funeral.

41:59.473 --> 42:01.867
What do you need me
to watch for, anyway?

42:01.910 --> 42:04.130
Think she's just going to
believe me?

42:04.173 --> 42:05.566
"Hi, I'm Cole.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.089
"I'm from the future.

42:07.133 --> 42:09.962
I came here in a time machine
to save mankind."

42:10.005 --> 42:11.137
That's ridiculous.

42:19.624 --> 42:22.278
How is that possible?

42:25.978 --> 42:29.198
We didn't just move
the facility.

42:29.242 --> 42:31.810
We went back in time.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.028
To when?

42:35.117 --> 42:38.164
The beginning.
