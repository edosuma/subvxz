WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.954
On the eve of
the mayoral election

00:02.962 --> 00:05.453
councilman Darren Richmond
made a stunning speech tonight.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.922
He admitted
to attempting suicide.

00:07.925 --> 00:08.550
The incident occurred

00:08.551 --> 00:10.837
on the night
of the Rosie Larsen murder

00:10.845 --> 00:13.177
Mr. Richmond...
Which one is it...

00:14.098 --> 00:15.929
Donnie or Marie?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.889
Those two are the only ones
in Richmond's campaign

00:17.894 --> 00:18.883
with enough power

00:18.895 --> 00:20.760
to broker a deal between
the Indians and Ames.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.022
Gotta bounce, Linden.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.014
With polls opening
in a few short hours,

00:24.025 --> 00:25.936
more will be revealed.

00:33.576 --> 00:34.986
All right. Hold up.

00:41.501 --> 00:42.866
Come with me.

00:44.504 --> 00:45.914
Linden...

00:45.922 --> 00:47.412
l have an idea.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.958
Come on.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.670
The hallway!

00:51.677 --> 00:53.463
- Listen to me!
- Hey!

00:54.222 --> 00:56.133
- Hurry up!
- All right, let's go!

00:56.140 --> 00:59.257
I've spoken before
about a man named Ted Wright,

00:59.268 --> 01:00.474
a man who...

01:00.478 --> 01:02.469
Dumb prick should've fallen
on his sword

01:02.480 --> 01:03.720
when I gave him the chance.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.392
In 21 hours,
the election will be over.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.435
We'll stick it in ourselves.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.323
I thought
you took care of this.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.313
Can I help you?

01:14.325 --> 01:15.690
I know about
the photo, Mayor...

01:15.701 --> 01:16.656
The one you planted.

01:16.661 --> 01:17.776
Where do you think
you're going?

01:17.787 --> 01:18.993
You need to leave right now

01:18.996 --> 01:20.406
- before I call security...
- l have a copy of it.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.405
- I'm going to The Times with it.
- She's lying.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.783
Or we can make a deal.
We have a common enemy.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.707
Show's over.
Come on. Let's go.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.376
If you want to win this
election, call off your dogs.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.124
What are you waiting for?
Get them out of here.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.342
There's nine hours
till the polls open, chief.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.883
We're running out of time,
Mayor.

02:12.258 --> 02:15.091
We know the Richmond campaign
screwed you first,

02:15.094 --> 02:17.210
planting the Indian bones.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.803
It was a smart move.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.640
Without the waterfront,
the election was over for you,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.474
so you retaliated with a photo.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.888
Richmond wasn't going
to prison.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.432
It would never
have gone that far.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.146
You just needed Richmond
out of the running

02:29.150 --> 02:30.686
till the election was over.

02:30.693 --> 02:31.808
Everything
that went down after that

02:31.819 --> 02:33.434
was just
collateral damage, right?

02:33.446 --> 02:35.528
Don't lay your guilt
on me, detective.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.022
You doctored the photo
to win the election,

02:38.034 --> 02:39.899
not to cover up Rosie's murder.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.367
We know you weren't involved
in her death.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.157
But the Richmond camp was.

02:48.753 --> 02:51.916
This is what's going to happen.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.504
You're going to call off
my arrest.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.124
Then you're gonna get them
and him

02:57.136 --> 02:58.421
and Carlson off our backs

02:58.429 --> 03:00.294
until we solve
Rosie Larsen's murder.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.389
In exchange,
we pursue our lead.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.134
And the photo?

03:06.145 --> 03:07.806
We drop it.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.098
Do we have a deal,
Mr. Mayor?

03:24.830 --> 03:26.661
Thanks.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.410
Did you guys get a dog?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.753
The boys needed
something good in their life.

03:39.929 --> 03:42.636
Stan, I'm so sorry.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.472
It doesn't matter.

03:47.103 --> 03:48.843
You're home.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.270
That's all that matters now.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.441
Don't eat that thing.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.231
There's probably six
razor blades in it.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.729
Mom!

03:59.740 --> 04:02.823
Ohh, sweetheart.

04:02.827 --> 04:06.160
Oh, my God.
I missed you.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.119
Oh, my baby.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.331
Oh.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.167
I've missed you so much.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.040
We got a dog.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.835
I can see that.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.879
Tommy, come here, baby.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.336
Tommy.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.220
Tommy.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.686
He'll be okay.
He's having a hard time.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.768
Let me go talk to him.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.108
Okay.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.602
Oh.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.353
I'm glad that you're back.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.151
We missed you.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.364
Oh. I can't let you go.
Let me look at you.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.287
I knew you'd come back.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.713
Chief Jackson said

05:03.721 --> 05:05.677
the casino security tapes
will be ready in the morning,

05:05.681 --> 05:06.966
but you got to get them
yourself.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.510
They're abiding
by the search warrant.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.927
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.889
Feds say the surveillance disks
will be ready in the morning,

05:12.897 --> 05:15.138
but we got to get our own asses
to the casino to pick them up.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.856
Yeah, I'm sure Nicole
complied fully with the warrant.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.020
Yeah.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.524
What'd Carlson say?

05:23.532 --> 05:26.444
You're still on suspension
till your hearing.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.036
That rent-a-cop
can play at being the boss

05:31.040 --> 05:33.406
as long as he leaves us
the hell alone.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.420
If Gwen wasn't
Richmond's alibi,

05:39.423 --> 05:41.038
then he wasn't hers either.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.792
Yeah, she could've made her way
from Tacoma to the casino

05:43.803 --> 05:45.589
just like we thought
Richmond did.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.555
Kill Rosie, be back in time
for Richmond's reappearance.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.557
You think blondie ran
through the woods, for real?

05:55.564 --> 05:58.931
Hunted Rosie,
beat her unconscious?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.318
It doesn't track.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.570
Except for the part
about the trunk.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.413
Rosie was still alive when
it went into the water.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.163
It's a really passive way
to kill.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.754
You don't have to look the person
in the face while they die.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.546
Men kill with guns and knives,

06:27.012 --> 06:28.877
women poison their victims.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.596
General rule.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.851
Mm.

06:32.852 --> 06:34.638
Mm.

06:38.190 --> 06:43.059
Earlier that night...

06:43.070 --> 06:46.187
Gwen had a dinner
with a city council member

06:46.198 --> 06:49.486
named Ruth Yitanes
at the lake union yacht club.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.984
Gwen said that Yitanes
canceled the dinner.

06:51.996 --> 06:54.487
It doesn't say why.
What about Jamie?

06:54.498 --> 06:57.990
Looks like he worked late,
went home to his grandfather.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.788
The guy alibi'd him.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.787
He lives with his grandpops?
Damn.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.925
You want to have a talk
with grandpa?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.050
I'll go to the campaign,
see who's in charge of keycards.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.389
Yo, Linden.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.599
Night of death,

07:15.603 --> 07:18.845
Jamie went to the city hall gym
at 4:37 am.

07:18.856 --> 07:19.845
So?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.393
Security guard who let him in

07:21.400 --> 07:23.607
said he didn't have
his key card.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.287
It may take more than a haircut

07:44.298 --> 07:45.708
to win you this, Darren.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.878
I'm counting on you, Charles.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.093
You've always been
my lucky charm.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.803
What? We're taking
a beating, aren't we?

07:59.063 --> 08:01.395
Preliminary polls aren't great.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.560
I told them the truth.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.480
I'm glad I did it.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.946
I'll tell you what...
I never heard a politician...

08:10.950 --> 08:13.157
- Hello?
- make a speech like that.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.076
Nothing to be ashamed about.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.869
| just hope folks
remember that today.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.334
I do, too, Charles.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.252
I do, too.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.716
Hey. Have you talked
to the grandfather yet?

08:38.727 --> 08:42.094
Yeah, Jamie's grandpa
said he was there all night.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.597
I mean, he seemed on the
up-and—up, but who knows?

08:44.608 --> 08:45.768
And I called Yie-taines

08:45.776 --> 08:47.516
or whatever the hell
her name is

08:47.528 --> 08:49.519
about Gwen Eaton's story
and nothing yet.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.815
Give me an hour,

08:50.823 --> 08:52.404
and then we got to get
those disks from the casino.

08:52.408 --> 08:54.990
All right. You find out who's
in charge of the key cards

08:54.994 --> 08:56.109
in the campaign yet?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.862
Yep, I'm talking to him now.
Got to go.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.580
Mr. Kinberg?

09:05.587 --> 09:07.964
Detective Linden, Seattle PD.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.921
Is this from your office?

09:10.634 --> 09:11.840
SCH, yeah.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.256
That's the prefix of our cards.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.799
Who does that card belong to?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.263
I don't have a list.
Sorry.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.973
It got deleted
from my hard drive.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.677
and somebody...

09:23.689 --> 09:25.475
When did you notice
it had been deleted?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.438
Um...

09:30.154 --> 09:32.816
Monday, October 8th.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.280
That's the Monday after
the Rosie Larsen murder.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.195
You didn't think
to bring this up?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.863
Well...

09:38.871 --> 09:40.111
What about a replacement card?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.862
Did anybody come to you
for a new card

09:41.874 --> 09:43.489
after that weekend?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.956
Um... yeah, but...

09:44.960 --> 09:46.666
Who was it?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.708
Gwen Eaton.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.436
This is a restricted area.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.355
Seattle PD.
We're here for the disks.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.863
Let me see that.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.820
Yeah? Perfect.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.983
Security's the door
on the right.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.204
- Oh, I guess they're out to lunch.
Too bad. - Yeah, whatever.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.415
Holder, check this out.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.420
Girlfriend likes the limelight.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.801
Speaking of which...

10:38.347 --> 10:39.803
What happened to her hand?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.138
Trouble in paradise?

10:43.060 --> 10:45.972
Maybe Bobby isn't just
her pit bull.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.435
Did you just figure that out?

10:47.439 --> 10:48.815
I'll take it from here.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.858
No late fees
on those DVDs, right?

10:56.865 --> 11:00.733
We have fully complied
with the federal warrant.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.405
Nothing to hide.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.495
Right, nothing but the footage
on the broken camera.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.371
How's your head, detective?
Feeling better?

11:09.378 --> 11:12.415
Much. What happened
to your girlfriend's hand?

11:13.298 --> 11:15.414
You know your way out.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.131
Hey, next time we
should do this at our place.

11:20.139 --> 11:22.721
Food's gonna be crap,
but the beds are free.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.762
Is that Gwen Eaton?

11:35.237 --> 11:38.104
Looks pretty cozy
with the Wapis.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.572
That's her pops, too.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.862
Well, that explains how
a blue blood like Gwen

11:42.870 --> 11:44.451
gets involved
with these lowlifes.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.740
What's her connection to Ames?

11:59.970 --> 12:01.835
Gwen is the one who
canceled on me.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.007
The balls on that one...

12:03.015 --> 12:04.926
Like l was the one
who called the meeting.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.389
You know, they're the ones

12:06.393 --> 12:08.258
who need my support
with the unions.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.137
Councilwoman Yitanes, did Gwen
say why she canceled dinner?

12:11.148 --> 12:13.013
Nope, she just left a message,

12:13.025 --> 12:15.607
said something had come up
with the campaign.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.943
You know, I'm not a detective,
detectives.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.106
But Jamie Wright

12:19.114 --> 12:21.446
has been loyal to Darren
for the last 10 years.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.781
Don't you think
it's kind of strange

12:22.784 --> 12:24.035
that after only
a couple of months,

12:24.036 --> 12:26.402
Gwen is his closest adviser?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.573
Meaning what?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.822
Meaning that she uses
her va-jay—jay

12:29.833 --> 12:31.243
to control her candidate.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.286
That's her MO.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.455
She pretends to be
in love with them...

12:34.463 --> 12:36.374
whatever it takes
to benefit her.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.541
Just like her daddy.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.006
Apple doesn't fall
very far from the tree.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.343
Miss Yitanes, does the Richmond
campaign have any relationship

12:43.347 --> 12:45.383
with Michael Ames
or his company,

12:45.390 --> 12:46.596
Columbia Domain Fund?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.307
CDF is a major supporter
of the mayor.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.893
And trust me, Sally is the one
in the Ames family

12:51.897 --> 12:54.058
that wears the pants,
not Michael.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.647
CDF is her company.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.267
Michael's her de facto
errand boy.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.939
So waterfront project
going down

12:59.947 --> 13:01.562
screws her, not him.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.188
Ohh. And here I thought

13:03.200 --> 13:05.816
you were just a slice
of brainless beefcake.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.113
So, tell me, does this
security breach

13:08.121 --> 13:11.158
have anything to do
with the Ames', too, huh?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.031
Thank you for your time,
councilwoman.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.249
Oh, I see.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.744
That's how we're gonna play it.
Okay. Fine.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.457
Where'd you get the info
on Ames' company?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.753
City planning department.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.938
Who'd you vote for, councilman?

13:36.942 --> 13:38.273
Oh, I was supposed to vote?

13:38.277 --> 13:40.017
I thought that was
the men's room.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.189
The latest exit polls
aren't in your favor,

13:42.197 --> 13:43.653
but it seems a lot of voters

13:43.657 --> 13:45.613
are responding positively
to your speech.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.948
Your thoughts,
Mr. Richmond.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.694
I've run an honest race.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.491
I've surrounded myself

13:51.498 --> 13:53.864
with the best people I know,

13:53.875 --> 13:57.288
people I could literally trust
with my life.

13:57.296 --> 13:59.958
Darren.
What are you doing here?

13:59.965 --> 14:02.297
Basketball court's
down the street, isn't it?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.292
Why, you want to play a game
of horse?

14:05.929 --> 14:08.921
How about a photo, huh?
Come on.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.924
That speech was the last
of your career.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.017
It's one I'm proud of, Lesley.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.807
You have one like that?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.099
Okay.
Got your money shot.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.722
We'll see you at the next stop.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.851
I called the car.
We'll be around back.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.228
Okay.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.025
- Thank you.
- Good luck, councilman.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.364
You look like
you could use a break.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.232
- Yeah.
- I know a secret exit.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.280
- Great speech the other day, councilman.
- Thanks.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.295
How long till the car
gets here?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.709
About a minute and a half.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.888
What is it, Gwen?

14:51.975 --> 14:53.966
That night.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.139
If I had known why you left

14:57.147 --> 14:59.433
or what you were going through.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.026
This should be your day...
Not his.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.237
It's not right.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.074
It's out of our hands.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.205
I tried so hard for you.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.126
We came so far, Darren.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.093
I'll see you at the next stop.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.641
It has the biggest eyes

15:40.649 --> 15:42.765
of any animal
in the entire world.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.765
Get out.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.768
As big as basketballs.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.816
I got four stars.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.780
Four stars?!

15:50.784 --> 15:52.240
Hey, guys.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.484
Hey!

15:53.495 --> 15:55.656
Will you make me
a grilled cheese? I'm hungry.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.575
Oh, I'll make it.
I'll make it for you.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.494
I like the way
she cuts off the crusts.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.879
Yes, of course.
Absolutely.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.470
Why don't you, Mr. four stars,
go get washed up.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.845
Sorry.
We've been eating

16:17.853 --> 16:20.686
a lot of grilled cheese
around here lately.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.348
They'll be glad to get back
to your cooking, believe me.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.029
You know, I found
a new place to live

16:35.036 --> 16:36.867
not too far from here.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.038
This yours?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.030
Oh, yeah.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.782
| just put some of my stuff in

16:42.794 --> 16:45.285
with the rest of the laundry.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.999
So I guess you guys are
gonna be busy moving soon,

16:51.011 --> 16:53.127
so I figured I better
get my ass in gear.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.180
Moving?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.393
The new house.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.728
I thought that since
you were back, I figured...

17:05.567 --> 17:08.149
What new house?
What are you talking about?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.358
I'm sorry.
I thought that you knew.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.153
l-l found out
by accident.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.447
You should just talk
to Stan about it.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.658
Yeah, I will.
I'll do that.

17:24.669 --> 17:28.127
Don't be mad at him,
okay? Mitch...

17:29.841 --> 17:32.423
we all did the best
that we could, you know...

17:32.427 --> 17:35.043
while you were gone.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.262
It was hard.

17:37.599 --> 17:41.592
Stan, the boys, they needed...

17:42.812 --> 17:46.396
They needed what, Terry?

17:48.652 --> 17:50.608
They needed what?

17:56.368 --> 17:58.199
You have no right to judge me..

17:58.203 --> 18:00.194
- I'm not judging you.
- Yes, you are.

18:00.205 --> 18:03.368
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are, Terry.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.491
You don't know what it's like.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.867
You don't have a family.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.584
You don't have children.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.125
You don't know
what it feels like.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.714
What do you know
about any of this?

18:13.718 --> 18:16.585
All I know is that
I've been working my ass off

18:16.596 --> 18:18.757
trying to keep
your family together

18:18.765 --> 18:20.505
while you were trying
to find yourself

18:20.517 --> 18:22.303
on some vision quest.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.014
You still had so much, Mitch.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.352
And you walked out.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.828
You walked out.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.669
These are all
Michael Ames' companies?

18:51.673 --> 18:52.913
All five of them.

18:52.924 --> 18:57.338
- All eligible to bid on city contracts.
- Okay, thanks, Ray.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.590
Ray says he got Nicole
and Roberta on tape

19:03.602 --> 19:05.558
on the casino floor
at 1:20 am.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.770
So, they couldn't have been
part of the attack on Rosie

19:08.773 --> 19:09.888
on the 10th floor.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.936
Ames was on the ferry.
Indians were on the floor.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.445
So, the attacker
must have been...

19:14.446 --> 19:16.402
Donnie or Marie.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.817
Check this out.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.408
One of Ames' companies

19:22.412 --> 19:24.653
doesn't got his wife's name
on the board.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.529
Just his.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.870
NCR.. Nereus Capital Properties.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.539
So he tanks the waterfront
'cause he's paving the way

19:35.550 --> 19:37.711
for his own company
to make a separate deal.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.461
Double-crosses the mayor,
screws his wife to boot.

19:40.472 --> 19:45.011
Ames really was planning on
leaving his wife... for Terry.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.056
Excuse me.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.692
Nereus Capital Properties
was formed a month ago.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.903
You made it eligible on city contract
a week later.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.239
That seems pretty fast.
Is that standard?

20:02.661 --> 20:05.778
I-it's not illegal.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.701
You expedited the process,
though.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.084
Want to explain why?

20:13.254 --> 20:14.790
I got an e-mail.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.585
There was an interested party
at city hall.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.173
- A councilman.
- Darren Richmond?

20:19.177 --> 20:20.633
Richmond sent you
an e-mail?

20:21.805 --> 20:23.966
It came from his aide.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.804
Was it Gwen Eaton?

20:25.809 --> 20:26.844
No.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.182
Jamie Wright.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.396
We're gonna keep this.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.946
Everyone of our posters
in 4th street

20:45.954 --> 20:48.570
have been pulled down or defaced
in the last two hours.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.368
You can't tell me the mayor's
people aren't behind that.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.830
Yes. Yes.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.500
Thank you, Nancy.
That would be lovely.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.543
Thank you for doing your job.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.254
Rule number one
in politics...

21:02.262 --> 21:04.753
Never run against a guy
with no scruples.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.471
You know anything
about a company called NCP?

21:07.475 --> 21:09.852
Uh, construction, right?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.889
All those 3-Ietter companies
sound the same.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.353
Yeah, your little lady down at
the city planning department...

21:14.357 --> 21:15.767
She gave us this.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.015
Your personal request

21:17.026 --> 21:20.234
to expedite NCP
through the system.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.478
You remember now?

21:21.489 --> 21:23.195
Yeah. I sent that.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.155
So what? It's routine.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.366
Is it?

21:27.829 --> 21:29.615
Look, it may not meet

21:29.622 --> 21:31.783
the highest standards
of political ethics,

21:31.791 --> 21:32.826
but it's not illegal.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.449
We do favors for friends
all the time.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.372
Well, what about enemies?

21:36.379 --> 21:38.461
NCP's owned by Michael Ames.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.171
He's playing
on Adam's side, not yours.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.040
Why you supporting
your enemy's BF, huh?

21:42.051 --> 21:44.918
You screwing the boss man
under the table?

21:44.929 --> 21:47.090
Spit it out.
We won't tell.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.475
- Promise.
- I'm trying to give my boss man

21:49.476 --> 21:51.467
a potential ally.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.060
Wooing away the competition's
major donors

21:54.063 --> 21:56.270
happens to be part
of my job description.

21:56.274 --> 21:57.855
FYI.

21:57.859 --> 21:58.769
That's fine.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.268
Richmond know
what you were up to?

22:02.530 --> 22:04.145
Wow.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.523
You tell your lieutenant
every time you have a hunch

22:06.534 --> 22:08.695
that could lead to nowhere?

22:08.703 --> 22:10.785
Does he even know
you're here right now?

22:10.789 --> 22:12.825
Was Gwen Eaton part
of wooing Ames, too?

22:12.832 --> 22:13.947
Okay, look.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.619
I know you got to do your job,

22:15.627 --> 22:18.494
but I'm not about to dish dirt
on a colleague for you.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.915
Ask her yourselves.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.335
Oh, one more thing.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.884
You got your city hall
key card on you, bro?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.637
What?

22:36.147 --> 22:39.605
Your city hall key card.
Do you have it?

22:44.197 --> 22:46.358
Now, if that's it, bro,

22:46.366 --> 22:48.857
I've got a campaign
to resuscitate.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.101
It's time for you
to buy your own pack.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.781
What if Gwen and Jamie
did it together?

23:35.248 --> 23:37.660
Even if she was the one
in the room that night,

23:37.667 --> 23:38.827
lost the key card,

23:38.835 --> 23:40.996
they both could have been
part of the plan.

23:42.547 --> 23:46.210
Explains the different methods
of taking Rosie out.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.629
Male and female co-killers.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.598
I mean, we know Ames got a call

23:55.602 --> 23:57.183
about the waterfront break-in
that night.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.642
That's why he nixed
his trip to Vegas.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.313
Maybe that's why Gwen
canceled dinner

24:03.318 --> 24:05.229
with councilwoman Yitanes.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.910
further comment.

24:16.915 --> 24:19.657
In other news, reputed Polish
mob boss Janek Kovarsky

24:19.667 --> 24:21.043
was gunned down

24:21.044 --> 24:23.160
in the Capitol Hill section
of the city last night.

24:23.171 --> 24:26.254
Sources say he was shot
in the head at close range.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.715
Homicide investigators have
no suspects or leads to date.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.176
And if the exit polls
are any indication,

24:32.180 --> 24:33.716
councilman Darren Richmond

24:33.723 --> 24:35.839
is not out of the race
for mayor just yet.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.509
Hey.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.429
What? What is it?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.141
It's nothing.

24:52.742 --> 24:56.985
Stan, Terry told me
about the house.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.662
That's where
all the money went, right?

25:07.256 --> 25:09.747
I should have
trusted you, Stan.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.212
I should have told you.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.800
I wanted it to be a surprise.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.596
God, it seems like
a lifetime ago,

25:20.603 --> 25:23.436
back when there were
good surprises.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.225
Yeah.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.653
So, what are you gonna do?

25:32.657 --> 25:35.490
Are you gonna...
Are you gonna sell it?

25:37.370 --> 25:39.986
Maybe we don't have to.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.582
Could be a fresh start,
Mitch...

25:44.585 --> 25:46.416
For all of us.

25:49.841 --> 25:54.084
Stan, l-l came back
because... I wanted...

25:54.095 --> 25:57.838
I wanted to be here, you know?

25:57.849 --> 26:02.263
With you...
and with our boys.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.144
There's a yard.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.645
And there's so much light,
Mitch.

26:10.653 --> 26:11.688
And the boys... the boys,

26:11.696 --> 26:13.061
they can each have
their own room.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.653
I don't want to leave this.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.034
I don't want
to leave her behind.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.210
You know,
there's no moving on...

26:35.511 --> 26:39.299
as long as we're here...
in this house.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.764
Is that what we're
supposed to do, Stan?

26:41.768 --> 26:44.305
We're just supposed to
move on and then...

26:44.312 --> 26:47.395
And we just forget everything?

26:49.025 --> 26:52.108
Yeah, I think
we should move on.

26:58.826 --> 27:02.284
You don't have a right
to look at me like that

27:02.288 --> 27:05.371
after what I've been through
these past few weeks.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.164
That's not fair.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.408
Fair?!

27:08.419 --> 27:10.705
What's fair got to do with it?

27:10.713 --> 27:12.374
You're the one who left.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.417
The boys... the boys,
they needed you.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.591
I needed you.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.385
And you walked out.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.428
I was the one who stayed.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.813
Because you could.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.599
I'm her mother.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.896
I'm her dad!

27:34.904 --> 27:37.520
What are you talking about?!

27:37.532 --> 27:40.490
Let me tell you something.

27:40.493 --> 27:44.236
You can take as much time
as you want

27:44.247 --> 27:45.908
to try to figure it all out.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.952
But you cannot come back here

27:48.960 --> 27:53.454
and say that you loved Rosie
more than I did.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.190
Yo, biff.
How's it hanging?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.864
Just gonna be a few.

28:25.872 --> 28:26.987
Seattle police department.

28:26.998 --> 28:28.863
Hey, if my car don't meet
the club's standards,

28:28.875 --> 28:30.740
you can just swap it out
with that jag, all right?

28:32.795 --> 28:34.956
Yo, why you taking down
my tags?

28:34.964 --> 28:36.374
Uh, club policy, sir.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.497
Sign here.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.169
Do you make
all the guests sign in?

28:39.177 --> 28:40.337
Yeah.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.881
Is the sign-in sheet
for Friday, October 5th, still there?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.129
Yeah, but I can't just
give it to you.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.846
Yo, ease up, son.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.842
Minimum wage ain't worth
fighting the po-po.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.811
Did you work that night, Gibby?

28:52.815 --> 28:55.477
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
I work the weekends,

28:55.484 --> 28:57.099
'cause the club members
get wasted,

28:57.111 --> 28:58.226
and the tips
are pretty awesome.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.317
Is that right?

28:59.322 --> 29:00.528
Yeah.

29:00.531 --> 29:02.487
Do you remember
seeing her here that night?

29:02.491 --> 29:04.527
Uh, |...

29:04.535 --> 29:06.400
A lot of people come through
here on the weekend.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.323
l... sorry.

29:08.331 --> 29:10.447
We're gonna hang on
to that for a second.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.368
Yeah.

29:14.212 --> 29:19.047
Here it is. Gwen Eaton,
8:37 pm, October 5th.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.086
Check out the license plate.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.469
563-TBO.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.177
That's the campaign car
Rosie's body was found in.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.891
We've almost closed the gap?

29:30.895 --> 29:32.431
Really? Okay.
I have to tell him.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.144
- I'll call you back.
- Miss Eaton?

29:34.148 --> 29:36.890
You have a minute?

29:37.777 --> 29:39.358
Not really.

29:40.321 --> 29:43.313
We're tracking a security breach
at city hall.

29:43.324 --> 29:46.031
You aware of any staff
who lost their key cards?

29:46.494 --> 29:47.825
Yes, I did.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.443
A few weeks ago,
it went missing from my purse.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.786
You got a replacement card?

29:50.790 --> 29:51.779
Yes.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.032
Just after the Larsen murder.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.292
Look, l was in Tacoma
all night.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.581
I already told you that.

29:58.589 --> 29:59.544
You also told us

29:59.548 --> 30:02.210
the councilman went missing
for several hours.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.674
Can you account
for that missing time

30:03.678 --> 30:05.009
on your end?

30:05.012 --> 30:08.470
I was alone in a hotel room asleep.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.260
What about earlier that night

30:10.268 --> 30:11.724
before you went to Tacoma?

30:11.727 --> 30:14.469
You had an appointment
with councilwoman Yitanes.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.186
I told the police that
weeks ago.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.897
Except Yitanes said
that you canceled on her.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.728
Yes, I had a personal reason
that wasn't relevant.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.446
I wanted to see Darren
that night, okay?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.281
I knew something was wrong.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.868
Now I know what it was.
We all do.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.907
What car were you driving
that night?

30:32.915 --> 30:34.121
Mine.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.241
Wrong, Eaton.

30:36.252 --> 30:39.085
You took the campaign car
to the yacht club.

30:39.088 --> 30:42.706
Yes. I mean, earlier
I drove the campaign car.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.457
Then I dropped it off
after the club,

30:44.468 --> 30:45.583
after I canceled dinner.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.004
Then I took my car to Tacoma.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.800
Why didn't you tell us
you were driving the car

30:49.807 --> 30:51.843
Rosie Larsen's body
was found in?

30:59.233 --> 31:01.349
You people nearly destroyed
a man's life

31:01.360 --> 31:02.896
with your false accusations,

31:02.903 --> 31:05.235
so I would be very careful
about what I say right now

31:05.239 --> 31:06.354
if I were you.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.105
We're just asking questions.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.982
You're the one who keeps lying.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.234
How about we continue this

31:11.245 --> 31:12.860
down at the station,
Miss Eaton?

31:12.872 --> 31:14.578
Not unless you're arresting me.

31:14.582 --> 31:16.288
And if you continue
to harass me

31:16.292 --> 31:18.374
or anyone else
involved in this campaign,

31:18.377 --> 31:21.540
I will have you shoveling reindeer
shit at the Christmas parade.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.627
Do | make myself clear?

31:25.343 --> 31:27.755
It's not real reindeers
in that parade.

31:27.762 --> 31:30.424
It's huskies with antlers
strapped on them.

31:40.358 --> 31:42.599
Ready for bed, boys?

31:42.610 --> 31:45.272
I am.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.237
I always get cold, mom.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.368
That's 'cause you kick off
your covers.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.828
You always did, little Denners.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.207
Even when you were a baby.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.948
I'd come in to check in on you,

31:58.959 --> 32:01.291
and your little feet
would just be so cold.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.212
You okay, mom?

32:05.216 --> 32:09.255
Yeah, honey, I'm good.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.628
You can make us
grilled cheese tomorrow, mom.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.720
Thank you, baby.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.103
Sweet dreams.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.570
It's all gonna be okay,
sweetie.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.581
Sleep tight.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.797
We're not out of the race yet.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.140
Yes!

32:58.811 --> 33:01.097
That's huge.
It's less than 2 points.

33:02.731 --> 33:03.982
More than that.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.645
We could still win
this damn thing.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.394
You have stood beside me
this whole time.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.396
Not even my family did that.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.398
Not that that's saying much.

33:17.830 --> 33:18.865
And it's that time.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.204
Oh, come on.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.789
I thought you were done
with that superstitious crap.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.533
I think of it
more as a tradition.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.661
And what am I supposed to
tell people...

33:26.672 --> 33:28.503
Their fearless leader
is too much of a pussy

33:28.507 --> 33:30.008
to watch his own returns?

33:30.009 --> 33:31.590
You're still in it, Darren.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.842
Hello?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.309
This is Darren.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.064
Who is this?

34:01.624 --> 34:03.455
What do you want?

34:05.294 --> 34:07.250
We're never gonna get
that damn disk

34:07.254 --> 34:08.209
from the Indians.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.203
Ames lawyered up,

34:09.215 --> 34:11.046
Donnie and Marie
are done talking.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.211
There's always a way in.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.925
Everybody makes mistakes.

34:14.929 --> 34:18.262
Most people make the same ones
over and over again.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.771
You never told me
he was your shrink.

34:34.156 --> 34:36.488
Rick.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.405
Your point?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.243
Nothing.
I'm just saying.

34:49.171 --> 34:51.913
You think
I'm gonna go nuts again?

34:51.924 --> 34:53.164
Nah, Linden.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.040
I got your back's
all I'm saying.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.720
Think of me as your sensei

34:59.723 --> 35:02.180
in the blood sport of life.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.394
Mm-hmm.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.815
Hey, check this out.

35:21.245 --> 35:24.078
That woman standing next
to Chief Jackson...

35:24.081 --> 35:26.072
Something's wrong with her arm.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.501
It's in a cast.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.621
Yeah, it's broken.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.543
Just like Roberta's hand.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.066
So, what is it?

35:54.445 --> 35:56.356
Was there a problem
with the disks?

35:56.739 --> 35:58.070
No.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.778
We just wanted to talk to you
about your girlfriend,

36:01.785 --> 36:03.195
Chief Jackson.

36:03.537 --> 36:05.619
I thought you might want
to do that in private.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.661
Do you recognize her?

36:14.798 --> 36:16.584
Name's Kallie Wimms.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.501
Nicole's head of security
before you.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.470
Yeah, I heard of her.
So what?

36:24.224 --> 36:25.600
You heard she's kicking it
these days

36:25.601 --> 36:29.014
up at the Bainbridge corrections
facility for women?

36:32.066 --> 36:34.182
You want to guess why, Bobby?

36:34.193 --> 36:35.854
I got no time for this.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.022
Why, is Nicole
gonna be back soon?

36:38.447 --> 36:40.904
Wouldn't want her to catch you
with us, would you?

36:42.576 --> 36:45.318
Hand looks pretty bad.
Why'd she do it this time?

36:46.664 --> 36:48.575
Maybe because of that key card?

36:48.957 --> 36:52.575
Yeah. Real funny
how that went down.

36:52.586 --> 36:55.077
Eight years ago, your girlfriend
got full immunity

36:55.089 --> 36:57.000
in exchange for her testimony.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.676
She pinned it all on Kallie.

37:01.512 --> 37:04.925
Court transcript.
Read it yourself.

37:04.932 --> 37:06.843
Yeah, that's right.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.685
Now Kallie's doing 10 to 20...

37:12.064 --> 37:15.522
on a murder-2 charge
she claims she never committed.

37:17.111 --> 37:19.147
Maybe Kallie's a lying bitch.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.940
Nicole sold out Kallie
when she needed to,

37:20.948 --> 37:22.609
and she's gonna do
the same thing to you.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.150
But you don't need us
to tell you that, do you?

37:26.161 --> 37:27.867
You know
she's gonna screw you over.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.452
You just haven't
figured out how.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.957
This is all bull.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.495
She doesn't trust you anymore.

37:36.964 --> 37:39.831
You kept that disk, didn't you?

37:42.428 --> 37:44.510
So you'd have something
to hold over her,

37:44.513 --> 37:45.673
something to prove

37:45.681 --> 37:47.592
she was involved
in Rosie Larsen's murder.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.725
Just in case.

37:50.102 --> 37:53.094
You don't have anything on us.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.596
You broke into my motel room,
you put that drawing up.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.108
My son's gone because of you,
you piece of shit.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.065
- I never broke into your place.
- So it's just a matter of time

37:59.069 --> 38:00.525
- we find something on you!
- I don't know

38:00.529 --> 38:02.235
what you're talking about.

38:02.239 --> 38:05.322
There ain't no "us"...

38:05.325 --> 38:07.737
When it comes to Chief Jackson.

38:07.745 --> 38:10.077
And you know that.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.325
She's gonna hang you out to dry
just like she did Kallie

38:15.335 --> 38:18.042
unless you make the first move.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.832
Nicole was on the 10th floor
that night.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.752
You weren't, but that disk is
the only thing that proves it.

38:23.594 --> 38:25.255
Give us the disk.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.980
I'll be a while, Jerry.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.234
Maybe you want to take a break?

38:50.245 --> 38:52.031
I'll call you
when I'm ready to leave.

38:52.039 --> 38:53.370
Of course, councilman.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.494
Here it is.
It's the campaign car.

38:56.794 --> 39:00.161
Heading into the casino
parking lot, 12:58 am.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.920
Can't see the driver.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.715
564-TBO.

39:10.057 --> 39:13.345
That's definitely the campaign
car Rosie was found in.

39:14.228 --> 39:16.310
Put in the other disk.

40:03.986 --> 40:06.398
1:02 am.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.368
I'm glad you came.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.241
You're a smart man.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.414
Get to the point.

40:23.422 --> 40:26.539
If you are who you say you are,
prove it.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.048
What's your hurry?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.713
You need to go somewhere

40:30.721 --> 40:33.713
and make another speech
about me? Hmph.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.620
That's one...

41:10.594 --> 41:12.960
Fast-forward the tape.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.010
Stop.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.065
Michael Ames.

41:27.361 --> 41:29.192
That's two.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.899
Just one more to go.

42:06.525 --> 42:08.436
What did you do?

42:08.443 --> 42:11.810
What the hell was so important
you had to talk to me tonight?

42:12.197 --> 42:15.109
Why did you lie to me, Jamie?
