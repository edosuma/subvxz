exactly been on speaking terms

it's really not just about

38:09.487 --> 38:12.957
<i>(quirky country music)</i>

38:18.296 --> 38:21.399
<i>(tender music)</i>

38:21.466 --> 38:23.568
Nice work.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.403
Nobody'll ever know.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.805
Thank God.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.907
I backed into one of those
parking lot pole thingies

38:28.973 --> 38:30.208
during Judd's obstacle course.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.043
Bollard.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.313
Parking lot pole thingies,
it's called a bollard.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.582
Ah.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.150
<i>♪</i>

38:39.217 --> 38:41.653
(sighs)

38:41.719 --> 38:44.255
Well, good news is,

38:44.322 --> 38:47.225
I guess an ambulance would be
a little bit more maneuverable.

38:49.227 --> 38:50.829
You heard?

38:50.895 --> 38:52.630
That you're looking
for a new captain?

38:52.697 --> 38:54.999
Yeah, I heard.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.769
You wanna tell me
what's going on with you?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.971
Look, I didn't say anything

39:00.038 --> 39:01.840
'cause I didn't wanna jinx it,

39:01.906 --> 39:03.007
and I don't even know

39:03.074 --> 39:04.409
if Captain Vega's gonna
offer me the job.

39:04.475 --> 39:05.777
Of course she is.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.111
You're an outstanding
candidate.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.847
She said that?

39:08.913 --> 39:10.448
Not directly,
but she'd be a fool not to,

39:10.515 --> 39:12.283
and the woman's no fool.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.786
So you're mad?

39:14.853 --> 39:18.189
I'm not mad.
I'm surprised.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.959
And a little stung.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.863
Look, TK,
is this really what you want?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.967
I think so.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.069
And it's not
some emotional reaction

39:31.135 --> 39:33.204
you're having because
of something I might've said?

39:33.271 --> 39:35.740
Emotional reaction?
What, like a tantrum?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.575
I did not say tantrum.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.410
No, Dad,
I'm not having a tantrum.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.746
Again, I word I never used.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.148
Look.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.619
I know that things
seem overwhelming...

39:47.685 --> 39:50.655
Yeah, they kinda really do.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.956
Well, I'm overwhelmed.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.659
But you're overwhelmed
with joy,

39:54.726 --> 39:56.261
which is great,

39:56.327 --> 39:59.230
and I'm just overwhelmed.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.501
But, you know, that's not new.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.503
You know, in the past,

40:05.570 --> 40:07.438
I'd cope with these feelings

40:07.505 --> 40:09.674
in a pretty unhealthy way.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.143
You know, so instead
of calling a paramedic,

40:12.210 --> 40:14.913
I'm thinking of becoming one.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.515
That's gotta count
for progress, right?

40:17.582 --> 40:20.151
Yeah, I can't argue that.
Look.

40:20.218 --> 40:23.187
You'd be an amazing addition
to any captain's team.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.255
(sighs)

40:24.322 --> 40:27.425
And if this is what
you really want,

40:27.492 --> 40:29.661
I'll support you.

40:29.727 --> 40:32.163
Thanks, Dad.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.198
You know I support you too,
right?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.601
I am actually happy
for you and Mom.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.002
And I don't even think
it's weird

40:38.069 --> 40:39.871
that you're having another kid
at your age.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.706
What is kind of weird

40:41.773 --> 40:43.708
is me having a baby brother
or baby sister of mine.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.110
Well, any kid would be lucky

40:46.177 --> 40:49.013
to have you as a big brother.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.549
And I can vouch for how lucky
that kid is

40:51.616 --> 40:54.052
to have you guys as parents.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.322
I mean, I'll admit I am,
you know, little jealous

40:57.388 --> 41:01.159
that he or she is gonna
have you guys together,

41:01.225 --> 41:05.229
which is something
I never really did.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.598
Yeah, I know.

41:07.665 --> 41:10.335
I'm sorry about that.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.636
(inhales deeply)

41:11.703 --> 41:14.839
You two are gonna be together,
right?

41:14.906 --> 41:19.077
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details yet.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.179
I'm sure it'll be a minefield.

41:21.245 --> 41:24.649
(laughs)
You'll find your way through.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.051
You are very good at that.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.922
All right, that should do it.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.858
Okay, Mateo,
try turning it over!

41:33.925 --> 41:36.427
Turning it over, boss.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.863
‐(engine revs)
‐Ay!

41:38.930 --> 41:41.032
Whoo!
Like butter, baby.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.500
I told you
it was the carburetor.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.035
Mm‐hmm.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.204
Y'all are too kind
doing all this for us.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.605
Don't mention it,
Miss Strickland.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.307
Paul's family is our family.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.541
All right.

41:50.608 --> 41:51.909
Thanks, y'all.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.545
You sure you're okay to drive?

41:54.612 --> 41:56.114
I feel good, thank you.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.217
All right, well, just make sure
you FaceTime me a bunch.

41:59.283 --> 42:00.318
(laughs)

42:00.385 --> 42:01.652
And if I can't be there
in real life,

42:01.719 --> 42:03.087
I at least wanna see
what you see.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.822
You just wanna make sure
we're okay.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.792
Yes, that is
the God's honest truth.

42:07.859 --> 42:11.029
Thanks for looking out,
big brother.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.035
Always.

42:19.303 --> 42:20.438
Mama!

42:20.505 --> 42:21.806
(laughs)

42:21.873 --> 42:24.142
Ah, bye, Mama.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.910
‐Take care.
‐Yeah, you take care, okay?

42:25.977 --> 42:27.345
‐And be safe.
‐CYNTHIA: Okay, okay.

42:27.412 --> 42:28.679
And take care of her.

42:28.746 --> 42:30.515
Oh, we take care
of each other, baby.

42:30.581 --> 42:31.682
‐That's how we do.
‐Mm‐hmm.

42:31.749 --> 42:33.284
(horn honks, door clicks shut)

42:33.351 --> 42:35.820
‐Love you.
‐Love you too, baby.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.324
(horn honks)

42:44.595 --> 42:46.264
GWYNETH: How's everything look?

42:46.330 --> 42:49.033
TECHNICIAN: Placenta
and uterus look good.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.437
Strong, steady heartbeat.

42:52.503 --> 42:53.671
Everything's great.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.606
‐(both laughing)
‐Thank you.

42:55.673 --> 42:56.707
Would you like to know the sex?

42:56.774 --> 42:58.009
No, no, we wanna wait‐‐

42:58.076 --> 43:00.445
God, yes.
Tell me now.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.712
It's a boy.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.214
Oh, snap!

43:03.281 --> 43:04.816
‐You called it.
‐I did call it.

43:04.882 --> 43:06.818
‐She totally called it.
‐I did.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.319
‐I love you.
‐I love you.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.254
Hey, little brother.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.190
I'll see you soon.
