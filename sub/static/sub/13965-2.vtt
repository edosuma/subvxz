00:13.556 --> 00:14.796
I'm trying to save you.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.046
You framed Alvis!

00:16.142 --> 00:18.599
You gave The Company
a reason to bomb the

Hey! The Company
didn't tell me
about the bombing.

Of course not,
none of us have.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.824

I saw something else.

It's a good face.

When we get to Old Town,
maybe he can tell us

against The Company,

11:38.073 --> 11:39.438
we have a warrant
for your arrest.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.319
Hmm.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.614
Alive or dead?
Alive, Bucky,
very much alive.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.695
(SIGHS)

11:46.790 --> 11:48.121
Hands. Show me hands.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.786
I can't come with you.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.960
Company will torture me,
make me give up Tighmon.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.544
You know
where he is?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.915
I know the guy's the only hope
this place has left.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.420
Whoa, whoa.
(CHUCKLES)

12:00.262 --> 12:02.628
See, you tell us
where Tighmon is,
and he can keep you company.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.338
You'll have a buddy
in Westhole.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.725
(CHUCKLES)

12:06.727 --> 12:08.137
So you haven't
seen Westhole.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.431
What's to see?

12:10.647 --> 12:15.357
Oh, they're all there,
Killjoys, just waiting
for you.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.809
But I'm not
going out like that.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.359
Don't!
(GUNSHOT)

12:18.447 --> 12:19.983
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

12:22.868 --> 12:24.074
(SIGHS)

12:25.287 --> 12:27.278
So do you want to grab
the proof of death pic?

12:30.334 --> 12:31.540
What the hells?

12:31.627 --> 12:34.369
Good news.
We found one of
our eight escapees.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.498
Bad.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.628
He found his gun.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.376
Worse news.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.256
The remaining seven
are holed up in the prison,
waiting for us.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.344
So an ambush?
Yeah, definitely.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.517
You ready, boys?
Is there any sign
of Pawter upstairs?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.095
No, not that there's
a lot of "upstairs" upstairs.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.517
Let me find out
where she is.
And Alvis, too?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.232
Just be careful.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.314
I like you
in one pretty piece.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.857
"Careful."

13:02.574 --> 13:03.689
Where's the fun
in that?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.827
All right, bitches.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.864
Who's up for
cleaning brains
off of brick?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.239
Hmm?

13:25.722 --> 13:26.882
Hold.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.340
All clear.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.970
Smells like ass, though.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.886
Wow, what is that smell?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.313
Taint.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.558
Decaying, moldy,
taint-y taint.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.693
Taint from what,
though?

13:45.242 --> 13:46.482
We got bodies.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.777
Weird bodies.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.239
In every cell.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.866
It's like
they're mummified.
Guys.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.293
(EERIE BREATHING)
Does anybody else
hear breathing?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.675
Step out where we can see you
with your hands up!

14:13.937 --> 14:16.303
Stand down.
We're Reclamation Agents.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.846
CARL: Eh?

14:18.316 --> 14:19.601
You're Reclamation Agents?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.146
Oh. Oh!

14:22.237 --> 14:25.445
Oh, thank gods.
Thank the gods.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.065
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.242
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.530
Okay, chill.
Hey, sorry.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.361
Who are you?
What are you?

14:33.457 --> 14:34.913
Uh, uh...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.456
I'm Carl.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.075
Give me that.
Ow!

14:39.755 --> 14:40.744
Give us a minute.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.505
Hey, brother, you do recon.
I'll get with the facial
scans again.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.957
But they don't
have faces.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.629
Well, then I'll count.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.050
What happened here, Carl?

14:51.141 --> 14:52.130
(SCOFFS)

14:52.225 --> 14:53.931
(STAMMERS)
There was this ship crash,

14:54.019 --> 14:55.930
and then some of
the prisoners escaped.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.603
I didn't know what to do,
so I followed the handbook.

14:58.982 --> 14:59.971
D'AVIN: Handbook?

15:00.067 --> 15:04.106
Yeah,
"In case of prisoner break,
push the red button."

15:04.362 --> 15:05.613
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

15:05.697 --> 15:09.110
I thought a tranquilizer gas
would come out, not this.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.698
What's back there, Carl?

15:11.620 --> 15:12.735
The guard station.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.994
I count six dead dusties.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.663
The guy at The Royale
makes seven prisoners.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.956
All we're missing is...
Tighmon.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.416
Carl, was he here
when you pushed
the red button?

15:20.504 --> 15:22.040
No, he'd already
made it out.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.837
But he came back.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.664
Weapons cage
is cleared out.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.125
Tighmon took
the big guns,

15:28.512 --> 15:30.127
little guns,
bullets, too.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.636
And the spare tank.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.135
What spare tank?

15:35.519 --> 15:38.977
What spare tank, Carl?
The spare tank
for the red button.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.522
It's why I'm still in here
where it's safe.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.023
Like, a puff of gas
took out this whole wing.
Imagine what a tank could do.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.271
(SIGHS)

15:51.827 --> 15:52.862
JELCO: Now, let me
get this straight.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.193
Not only have you
not caught Tighmon,

15:54.287 --> 15:56.903
but he now has a tank
of extremely fatal
weaponized chemical.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.454
Oh, I must say,
I'm very impressed.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.032
Do you have
a comments card
I can fill out?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.663
Look, you have to
evacuate Old Town.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.335
There ’s no telling who
or how many people
he plans to kill.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.504
And what if he smuggles it out
during this evacuation,

16:06.591 --> 16:08.331
or if it spreads
across Westerley?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.251
Or the rebels use it
to attack Qresh again?
No, / won’t evacuate.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.595
Do yourjob.
Find Tighmon and kill him.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can'tjust turn it
into a kill warrant.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.091
That’s not
how this works.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.470
Why not?
I hired you.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.678
/ work for The Rack,
not The Company,

16:20.772 --> 16:22.683
and you’re my client,
not my boss.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.310
We have a lead
on Tighmon.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.562
We find him,
we bring him in,
and then we are done.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.903
Make me happy, Killjoys,
because good luck to you

16:29.990 --> 16:31.605
getting out of Old Town
ifyou don't.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.442
That guy's
the dickiest dick
who ever dicked.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.573
Yeah, but he's the dick
with the keys to the wall.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.704
So how do we play this?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.911
Now we really have to get
this body bag to Pawter.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.789
JOHN: Pree said
she was last seen
at the tenements.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.083
I'm just gonna say it.
Pawter's people
bombed this place.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.290
What if someone
hurt her?

16:49.384 --> 16:51.124
DUTCH: Don't worry.
Everybody needs a doctor.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.676
PAWTER: God damn it, hold him.
Guys, in here.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.135
Pawter.
(SIGHS) It's about damned
time, Johnny Jaqobis.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.518
That first night
out of the tunnels,

17:01.605 --> 17:02.936
I must have
treated 70 patients.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.356
We ran out of antibiotics
the next night,
then medication.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.025
It's been 10 days.
When is The Company
gonna give us supplies?

17:09.112 --> 17:10.773
The Company
is not coming in,

17:11.448 --> 17:13.484
at least until
we find out
what did this.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.281
Brace yourself.
It's pretty bad.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.199
Last week, a guy came in
carrying his own intestines,

17:20.290 --> 17:21.530
but if it makes you
feel better...

17:21.666 --> 17:23.372
Ooh, a mummy.
So messed up.

17:25.629 --> 17:26.994
This guy was alive
last night.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.794
JOHN: Don't inhale the dust.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.788
Impossible.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.541
There's no moisture
in his body.

17:32.636 --> 17:33.921
His desiccation rate
would've had to have been...

17:34.012 --> 17:35.218
It's a Company chemical.

17:35.847 --> 17:36.882
Of course it is.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.009
And we're chasing someone
who stole an entire tankful.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.310
It'd be nice to know
how to survive it.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.477
From what I can tell,
it's an anhydrous
sodium hydroxide

17:44.564 --> 17:46.680
with an accelerated
cobalt chloride complex.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.477
Water diffuses it, but...

17:50.403 --> 17:51.779
You'd have to
swallow a lake.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.981
But you want a second opinion,
we can always ask
a Company officer.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.987
They called it
The Aridity Solution.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.118
There is no surviving it,
don't think.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.574
You breathe it in,
you die.

18:06.836 --> 18:07.871
No.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.833
You dry up,
then you die.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.961
It's good
to see you, Hills.
HILLS: You, too.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.839
Pawter's the only person
I get to see anymore.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.509
She's got me hidden.
Because people
want to kill you.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.430
Well, people want to
kHlanybody

18:21.518 --> 18:23.224
who was ever associated
with The Company.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.181
What do you know
about Liam Jelco?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.644
He's controlling
the wall.

18:26.898 --> 18:27.933
(SCOFFS)

18:28.024 --> 18:29.139
Nota fan, huh?

18:30.694 --> 18:35.688
Jelco's expertise was
extraction and torture,
not management.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.985
Guess he's gotten
a promotion.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.317
From breaking people
to breaking whole towns.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.569
Nifty.
PAWTER: Don'tjoke.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.872
I'm about to lose
half my patients
and the rest of my mind.

18:46.710 --> 18:47.870
Somebody has to stop him.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.288
Why not you?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.921
Look, you need to
get in touch with Qresh.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.088
PAWTER:
Why would I do that?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.711
So you can get in
your mother's face.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.876
Have her make
The Nine Families
get involved down here.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.881
Johnny Jaqobis,
you beautiful idiot.
It's not that easy.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.513
And the rest of my patients
would die while I'm gone.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.809
No offense, Pawter.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.062
But one doctor's not gonna
save all of Old Town.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.976
Okay, Hills is saying that
Alvis and Tighmon go way back.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.736
So where do we
find Alvis?

19:17.824 --> 19:18.859
He's in hiding.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.659
The Company wants him dead,
but killing him would turn him
into a martyr.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.828
So they have their informants
spreading stories.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.121
That Alvis is to blame
for the bombings.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.954
PAWTER: The Company
is hoping that Old Town
will kill Alvis for them.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.827
Sometimes I think
Alvis is, too.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.212
He’s kind ofin a dark place.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.089
DUTCH: We gotta go find him.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.506
Scarback scum!

very fast, Westie.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.440

19:58.573 --> 19:59.904
And I'll take that bag.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.859
What was that about?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.110
New hobby.

20:06.831 --> 20:07.820
Restitution.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.041
Pawter needs meds and Jakk
for her patients. I give her
whatever I can find.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.789
By using yourself
as bait?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.869
(SIGHS)

20:16.508 --> 20:18.464
Most people are trying to get
out of Old Town, you know?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.464
That's me.
I'm quite the contrarian.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.134
It's good to see you,
Alvis.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.848
There are things
I need to talk to you about,

20:30.980 --> 20:33.016
but right now,
I need a favor.
Anything.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.064
We're on a cleanup warrant
after the prison break.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.402
You're working
for The Company?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.898
I needed a warrant
to get past the wall
and here to you.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.906
We're looking for
Tarren Tighmon.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.119
Yeah, I can help
with that.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.997
PAWTER: How did you
hurt your leg?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.006
Some bitch stomped on it.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.389
Well, if I'm gonna set this,
you'll want painkillers.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.931
Luckily, I have a friend
who just sent a fresh batch.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.136
I can spare you one.
I think I'll take them all.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.434
You don't even
need surgery.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.520
(GROANING)

21:19.737 --> 21:21.068
Now you need surgery.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.022
What is wrong
with you bitches?

21:26.661 --> 21:27.992
JOHN: Tighmon.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.827
We know
you're in there.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.790
ALVIS: Tell Tighmon
Alvis wants to talk.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.955
Well, now we know
he's definitely
not alone in there.

21:41.384 --> 21:44.296
The miners' former union boss
was killed in the bombings.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.218
What I hear is,
they took Tighmon
back as leader.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.716
Yeah, well,
Tighmon's a murderer.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.968
But he's a hero
to these guys.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.138
Look, I'll do the talking.
You guys scan
for this Aridity thing.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.435
What Aridity thing?

21:55.398 --> 21:56.387
Dusty!

21:58.568 --> 21:59.774
That Aridity thing.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.236
That's what we do
to Company pigs.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.819
Look. We're Killjoys.
We're here to talk.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.533
They're with me,
Tighmon.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.534
Just you, Alvis.
And her.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.246
No way.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.084
I'll be fine. I'll leave
my comm on so you can hear
what's happening.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.174
D'AVIN: Five more minutes,
and we're shooting our way in.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.678
JOHN: Lucy, get me
the tunnel maps.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.598
ALVIS: Tighmon is housing
the miners' families until
they get back to work.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.484
He's all they got.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.916
Tarren Tighmon,
this is Dutch.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.583
I have a warrant
for you.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.752
And I have something
that can kill a lot of people.

23:06.636 --> 23:07.716
But I'm thinking...

23:09.264 --> 23:10.504
Maybe we negotiate.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.927
I don't speak for The Company.
I'm just a Killjoy.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.301
None of us are
what we used to be.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.104
There are people
all through this place.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.442
Our wives, kids,
other miners.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.650
I want them out of Old Town.
That's the deal.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.116
ALVIS: And what about
everyone else?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.987
There are more people
in Old Town than miners
and their families, Tighmon.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.787
You judging now?
Scarbacks got us into this.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.784
Scarbacks are the ones
trying to force The Company

23:37.875 --> 23:39.331
out of Old Town,
not run away.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.250
But yet you're lurking
in the tunnels,

23:42.672 --> 23:44.208
praying to your gods.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.131
How's that forcing
The Company out?

23:48.678 --> 23:52.091
I remember you in the mines
almost getting beat to death

23:52.181 --> 23:54.263
for talking back
to a Company foreman.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.933
Where's that Alvis?
Bring him back.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.136
When did you become
such a coward?

24:00.481 --> 24:01.766
What do you want,
Tighmon?

24:02.984 --> 24:04.349
I want you to
speak for us.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.519
Somebody has to.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.110
Go back to The Company
and talk some sense
into those assholes.

24:12.201 --> 24:16.444
They can have me and the gas,
but they're gonna let
everybody else here go.

24:17.874 --> 24:18.909
They won't.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.911
It's yourjob to see
your warrant through.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.375
Well, this is
how you do it.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.715
So promise me you'll try.

24:30.678 --> 24:31.667
I'll try.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.295
Company drone!
DUTCH: Get down!

24:34.390 --> 24:35.470
How'd they find him?

24:35.558 --> 24:36.593
DUTCH: Jelco!

24:37.393 --> 24:40.476
We gotta get out of here
before they realize that we
led The Company to Tighmon.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.975
Alvis, move!

24:44.484 --> 24:45.519
Take the gas.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.350
Stairwell. Go!

24:49.238 --> 24:50.227
Where's Tighmon?

24:50.698 --> 24:51.733
DUTCH: Dead.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.151
The Company must have
followed us.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.621
Asshole pulled
a knife on me.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.578
It's only gonna get worse.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.752
Jaqobis thinks I need to
talk to my mom,
get The Nine involved.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.874
Jaqobis is right.
What are you doing?

25:07.965 --> 25:10.798
Spring Hill's got a holophone.
I can get you in there.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.295
You abandoned your post
when the bombings started.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.672
They're gonna throw you
in Westhole.

25:13.930 --> 25:17.468
Well, it's only fair,
seeing as how I threw you
in Westhole once.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.265
(CHUCKLES)

25:20.144 --> 25:21.805
That's right, jerk.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.106
And if things go sideways,
your mom can get me out,

25:27.193 --> 25:28.433
with a royal pardon.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.569
Don't put faith
in my family.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.489
I'm not.
My faith's in you, Red.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.124
DUTCH: I had it under control.
I was talking Tighmon down.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.499
Well, / wish you’d talked
faster. I wouldn’t have to
do your job for you.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.547
Now, bring me that tank.

25:52.343 --> 25:53.583
What are you
gonna do with it?

25:53.678 --> 25:55.794
/ told you,
I can’t let my troops inside,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.424
especially now that
chemical’s on the loose.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.801
And I told you,
we don't work for you.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.976
Look, all the prisoners
are dead. The warrant is
complete.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.098
Let us out, or you're
dealing with The Rack.

26:05.565 --> 26:09.023
Oh, lsee, this is the part
where we call each other’s
bluff.

26:10.778 --> 26:11.938
All right.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.566
What's he doing?

26:14.824 --> 26:16.655
Something evil,
I'm next to positive.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.237
(ALARM BLARING)
JELCO: People of Old Town.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.952
JOHN: God,
there's more of him.

26:22.039 --> 26:26.829
My name is Officer Liam Jelco,
and l sympathize
with your suffering.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.659
Oh, he is so
full ofshit.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.963
However, I do need your help,
and as a reward,

26:32.049 --> 26:35.337
/ am offering free passage
out of Old Town to Leith,

26:35.678 --> 26:38.420
to where a new
Company-provided home
awaits you.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.015
All / need are two things.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.299
Dutch...
I'm not gonna like this,
am I?

26:42.852 --> 26:46.891
JELCO: This tank of gas,
which was stolen from me,
and second...

26:46.981 --> 26:48.312
Yep, I'm gonna hate it.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.102
This Kil/jo y. Alive.

26:51.194 --> 26:53.936
Or dead.
Doesn’t matter much to me.

26:54.363 --> 26:58.026
Once again, big reward.
Get creative.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.700
Bastard.
Dutch, we need to
get to ground, now.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.621
Who's behind you?
All of Old Town,
trying to kill me.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.293
Jelco tracked us
to Tighmon.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.247
Johnny, scan me now.

27:20.431 --> 27:21.466
A tracker.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.468
JOHN: D'av?
I got one, too.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.844
Yeah, which
I'm assuming means...

27:24.936 --> 27:26.551
They messed with them
while we were unconscious.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.137
Jelco used us
to fish out Tighmon
right from the start.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.689
Pree, flush these.
Jelco tracked the shit
out of us.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.016
We'll shit the track
out of him.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.275
That makes no sense.
Because I'm angry.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.146
Now, how do we
get out of here?
We need to get over that wall.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.573
Or under it.
Spring Hill is a bio-dome.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.776
They must've dropped in
some kind of ventilation shaft

27:42.912 --> 27:45.119
or drainage system.
Yeah, but all that
hot air and sewage

27:45.206 --> 27:46.491
has to come out
of someplace.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.958
Yeah, while you two
were talking to Tighmon,

27:48.042 --> 27:49.578
I had Lucy do a reading
on the tunnels.

27:49.752 --> 27:50.912
ALVIS: Show me.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.248
Here. This a maze of
mechanical systems. If it's
anywhere, it's right there.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.921
Get Hills and Pawter.
Meet us down there.
All right.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.169
Alvis, lead the way.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.720
Of course.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.465
Let's go.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.935
DUTCH: Safeties off.
We don't know
what's down there.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.273
Let's go, Pree.
I can't.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.067
What? You're not coming?
Baby, this is my home.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.731
I'm not losing it again.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.489
Just get out of here, alive.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.800
Officer Hillary Oonan.
Welcome back to The Company.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.503
Thank you,
and this is...

28:43.598 --> 28:46.590
lllenore Seyah Simms.
It's an honor.

28:46.684 --> 28:47.969
I'd like a private call
with my mother

28:48.060 --> 28:49.891
and a ship to Qresh.
That's not going to happen.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.561
But at least you're not stuck
inside Old Town anymore.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.309
Are you disobeying me?

28:55.818 --> 28:56.933
I'm protecting you.

28:58.321 --> 29:01.154
Officer Oonan should
really have warned you
about the bombing.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.780
Had you evacuated...

29:02.867 --> 29:04.027
I would have resisted.
One moment.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.358
Bit of a roll
going on here.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.822
Officer Oonan should
really have warned you

29:07.914 --> 29:09.495
about the bombing...
Oh, wait...

29:10.833 --> 29:11.993
You did warn her.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.746
You warned
all of Old Town.

29:14.837 --> 29:15.917
I pulled the alarms.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.245
ltold him to.
She didn't.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.500
Oh, I know.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.051
You disobeyed
The Company,

29:22.094 --> 29:23.254
abandoned your post.

29:23.346 --> 29:27.510
I don't agree
when The Company decides
an entire town of people

29:27.600 --> 29:30.216
has to die
to quell a revolution.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.273
Have me court-martialed,
send me to prison,
I don't care.

29:37.777 --> 29:41.019
I saved people.
Doing that saved me.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.195
And where are
your saviors now?

29:46.702 --> 29:47.737
No!

29:50.122 --> 29:51.373

29:52.249 --> 29:53.864

have been hard.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.368
I apologize,
but you're safe now.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.209
We'll take
good care of you.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.041
I'm sorry.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.468
I'm so sorry.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.188
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

30:20.736 --> 30:22.727

water supply system.

30:22.989 --> 30:23.978
You two go ahead.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.313
I'll send Johnny on
when I see him.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.488
DUTCH: Aren't you coming?

30:26.659 --> 30:30.026
I organized the resistance.
I can't exactly be seen
in a Company bunker.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.406
But we'll figure
that out.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.124
Even ifyou get me
out of Old Town,
where am I gonna go?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.616
Arkyn.
Back to Red 17?

30:36.711 --> 30:37.826
Back to the moon.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.787
And whatever lab
he said the Scarbacks
were attacking.

30:41.549 --> 30:42.538
That way.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.667
The Scarbacks haven't
been seen in Arkyn
in over 200 years.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.088
Two hundred years?

30:51.934 --> 30:54.050

Hey!

I can't keep praying
for something to change.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.151
I'm sorry, Dutch,
but The Company has to pay.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.567
Alvis, open the door.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.282
Pay how, Alvis?
What the hell
is he doing?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.988

gas Spring Hill. Alvis!

up there!

You're a Scarback!

You take people's suffering.
You don't cause it!

give it to Jelco?

31:26.552 --> 31:28.668

back empty, and
we can still do that.

come back and total

Come on, Alvis,
you little freak.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.241
Guys, it's been too long.
We don't want to drown him.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.535
We've only got
one shot at this.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.036
Okay, now.

33:26.964 --> 33:27.953
(GROANS)

33:36.515 --> 33:37.550
Shit.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.806
Shit, Dutch,
he's not breathing.

33:54.825 --> 33:55.940
It's not working.

33:56.744 --> 33:58.200
(GRUNTING)

34:11.759 --> 34:12.748
(COUGHS)

34:13.969 --> 34:14.958
(SIGHS)

34:17.514 --> 34:18.799
(COUGHING)

34:20.684 --> 34:21.673
Alvis.

34:22.311 --> 34:23.346
Yeah.

34:25.773 --> 34:26.762
(GROANS)

34:36.492 --> 34:39.404
It's empty.
I released it into
your sewage system.

34:39.495 --> 34:42.862
And thank you for
exposing a weakness
in our wall security.

34:43.374 --> 34:44.534
We'll be fixing that.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.037
Just so we're clear,
I always finish my warrants.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.412
Consider this one a bonus.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.790
Now I feel terrible.
I didn't bring you anything.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.166
Why are you here, Jelco?

34:52.549 --> 34:54.835
The mines are closed.
Workers can't work.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.963
What's the point
of your goddamn wall?

34:57.054 --> 35:00.638
The Old Town rebels
attacked Qresh, made
The Nine look weak.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.839
This is payback?

35:01.934 --> 35:04.050
This is image management.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.389
The whole Quad
is watching.

35:06.939 --> 35:10.352
They need to see
the price you pay
for disobedience.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.978
So you just sit here
in your bubble

35:12.069 --> 35:14.981
and make the Quad
watch people starve
to make a point?

35:16.115 --> 35:17.321
Well, you know
what they say...

35:17.574 --> 35:20.361
"Feed a cold,
starve a rebellion."
(CHUCKLES)

35:21.829 --> 35:24.787
I'm going to make Old Town
wish for the good old days

35:24.873 --> 35:29.583
when they had food
and water and
honest work to do,

35:30.504 --> 35:32.540
and one day,
they'll tell the Quad

35:33.048 --> 35:36.131
and all those other
little gestating
rebellions the truth.

35:38.721 --> 35:41.963
They need The Company.
The Company is good.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.933
And that is the day
when I'll take down
my goddamn wall.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.348
Now, it's been
a fun visit.

35:50.441 --> 35:53.899
You and your
moist friends
need to get out.

35:54.403 --> 35:56.485
Not without Pawter Simms
and Hillary Oonan.

35:56.572 --> 35:57.652
We know
that they're here.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.321
Officer Oonan
has a headache.

35:59.408 --> 36:02.445
As for Seyah Simms,
she'd love to say goodbye.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.109
(DOOR OPENING)

36:07.916 --> 36:09.577
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.871
lam, and that's a good thing.
There's a lot I can
do from in here.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.172
Hey.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.432
A little out of your
league, Killjoy.

36:35.611 --> 36:36.771
You stay safe.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.114
You want to
tell me what...
Shh.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.788
Can you hear me?
Don't answer,
just make a sound.

36:53.962 --> 36:54.951
(LAUGHS)

36:55.422 --> 36:59.131
Look, I don't want you
feeling alone in there.
lfyou need me, we're there.

36:59.593 --> 37:00.582
(COMMUNICATOR BEEPS)

37:01.011 --> 37:02.000
(LAUGHS)

37:04.890 --> 37:05.970
What's so funny?

37:29.498 --> 37:30.533
Gared.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.244
Welcome to Pree's place.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.001
I heard your
friends are gone.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.625
Why don't you make me a drink
and get the hells out?

37:43.470 --> 37:44.585
Leave?

37:45.222 --> 37:46.428
This place?

37:47.349 --> 37:50.466
No. No, The Royale
is the heart of this town.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.225
There's a beat to it.

37:53.021 --> 37:56.013
And the people of Old Town,
they're its blood.

37:57.568 --> 38:00.150
They stumble in here weak
and flow out stronger,

38:00.487 --> 38:04.196
and drunker, but more
hopeful, more alive.

38:06.535 --> 38:08.901
What if I give you money?
Hmm?

38:09.037 --> 38:10.197
All you can drink?

38:10.456 --> 38:12.822
(GASPS)
Free sexers upstairs.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.123
No, I'll get that anyway.

38:16.378 --> 38:17.367
Mm.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.416
I guess it's only fair,

38:21.300 --> 38:23.165
considering what I did
to get the place.

38:23.427 --> 38:24.416
(LAUGHS)

38:26.388 --> 38:27.377
What'd you do?

38:29.683 --> 38:32.220
(SCREAMING)

38:33.812 --> 38:35.018
Worse than that, honey.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.766
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHS)

38:37.065 --> 38:40.899
Tonight, happy hour
goes all night!

38:41.361 --> 38:43.738
(ALL CHEERING)
(LAUGHS)

38:44.323 --> 38:45.312
Whoo!

38:47.534 --> 38:48.614
(ENGINES WHIRRING)

38:51.580 --> 38:54.743
Since when did revenge
become part of
Scarback dogma?

38:57.294 --> 38:58.830
I got a little
lost back there.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.172
VVeH,Iguess
I'd be a hypocrite

39:04.259 --> 39:06.875
if I said I don't
understand what
that feels like.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.136
Do you want to
make it up to me?

39:16.563 --> 39:17.723
Come with us to Arkyn.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.433
I told you.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.811
There are no Scarbacks
on Arkyn.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.733
But there were,
at some point.

39:23.946 --> 39:25.061
Maybe.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.108
What are you looking for?

39:31.620 --> 39:32.860
Truth.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.862
There's something
going on in the Quad.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.908
I think it
started on Arkyn,

39:40.295 --> 39:41.910
and I think
I need your help.

39:42.464 --> 39:43.453
(SIGHS)

39:43.590 --> 39:44.796
As luck would have it,

39:46.468 --> 39:48.800
my schedule's
wide open right now.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.178
I also don't seem to
have a home, so...

39:55.143 --> 39:56.349
If you need me, I'm in.

39:58.689 --> 39:59.678
(ALARM BLARING)

39:59.815 --> 40:02.898
Lucy? Lucy?

40:04.653 --> 40:05.642
Lucy!

40:06.238 --> 40:07.227
Johnny.
Yeah, I know.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.734
Lucy's not answering
me either. I tried
sweet-talking her, too.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.281
Why is she bringing us
back to Westerley?

40:11.368 --> 40:12.904
She likes the Badlands
this time of year?

40:14.162 --> 40:15.242
Somebody's controlling her.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.036
Jelco.
No, not possible.

40:17.124 --> 40:18.785
I had her locked up tight
when we were in Old Town.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.491
Khlyen.

40:28.385 --> 40:30.250
JOHN: Touchdown.
Suit up,
grab your guns.

40:30.345 --> 40:33.052
He took D'av away
from me once, he doesn't
get to take my ship, too.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.233
TURIN: Killjoys.
DUTCH: Bloody Turin.

40:48.530 --> 40:49.690
Down here.

40:51.825 --> 40:54.157
He must have had
aniHegalbeacon
to bring Lucy down.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.114
Turin, what the hells
do you want?

40:57.623 --> 40:58.703
Do you know what?
I don't even care.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.326
Put your fist through
his gut this time.

41:00.417 --> 41:01.452
Gladly.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.708
Easy there, Man-Rage.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.245
I had to bring you
somewhere safe
to talk to you.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.251
Why? I thought you said
everything was
fine at The Rack.

41:08.342 --> 41:09.377
I lied.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.708
I don't know who's
listening in anymore.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.509
The whole place
is compromised.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.633
By what?
The Level Six program.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.556
I don't know what
its real purpose is,

41:18.894 --> 41:20.976
but I'd like to.
Wouldn't you?

41:22.522 --> 41:24.729
We'll find our
own answers. Thanks.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.182
Where's that?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.064
The Red 17 base on Arkyn?

41:31.031 --> 41:34.148
Oh, come on, I've been
tracking you assholes
for weeks now.

41:35.619 --> 41:38.452
Red 17 is gone.
It's cleansed.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.487
Khlyen's people
bombed the shit
out of it

41:40.582 --> 41:42.664
after you sneaky bastards
escaped from there.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.169
Assuming we believe you,
what do you want from us?

41:48.590 --> 41:51.002
I want you to take
some unofficial assignments.

41:51.093 --> 41:52.958
Let's call them
unsanctioned warrants.

41:53.929 --> 41:57.171
See, I've been putting the
pieces together ever since
Khlyen showed up in the Quad.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.807
I'm close, but I got
too many eyes on me.

42:01.478 --> 42:05.096
So this is the deal.
You use me, I use you.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.560
Because until we know what
The Rack's real endgame is,

42:07.776 --> 42:09.107
we're all being used.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.771
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)
