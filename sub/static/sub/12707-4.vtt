WEBVTT

00:01.901 --> 00:03.504
Buffy's like nobody else
in the world.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.042
But she doesn't love me.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.144
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:11.179 --> 00:15.416
What have you done to me?
 Professor Walsh, she implanted
 the behavior modifier.

00:15.448 --> 00:18.486
-RILEY: The chip in my head.
-ADAM: Actually,
 the chip is here,

00:18.518 --> 00:22.190
tied directly into
your central nervous system
through the thoracic nerve.

00:22.222 --> 00:26.160
-RILEY: What's happening to me?
-BUFFY: Engelman said
 Walsh was feeding you drugs.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.661
RILEY: Something's
 crawling inside.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.196
DOCTOR: I don't want
 to think about

00:29.230 --> 00:31.332
the damage our guys could do
under the stress of withdrawal.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.067
JOYCE: Buffy,
if you're going out,

00:33.100 --> 00:34.435
why don't you take your sister?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.270
Mom!
Mom!

00:36.304 --> 00:40.006
(thinking)
 Nobody knows who I am.
 Not the real me.

00:40.039 --> 00:42.509
No one understands.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.978
No one has an older sister
 who's a Slayer.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.551
(animal howling)

01:10.737 --> 01:11.572
(grunts)

01:16.144 --> 01:17.811
(panting)

01:17.844 --> 01:19.847
(snarling)

01:21.013 --> 01:22.150
(snarling fades)

01:22.182 --> 01:24.585
(growling)

01:36.197 --> 01:39.167
Riley?
Buffy. What are you
doing here?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.835
My job.
Well, I just thought
you were in the north sector.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.837
Watch out!
(roaring)

01:45.272 --> 01:46.473
(bone cracking)

01:48.509 --> 01:50.311
Never mind.

01:56.849 --> 02:00.188
(growling)
(gasps)

02:02.355 --> 02:04.658
Why do I even
bother to show up?

02:06.659 --> 02:09.127
Spike,
what are you
doing here?

02:09.163 --> 02:13.032
Same reason as you
and your cub scout
here, I wager.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.969
Wanted a spot of violence
before bedtime.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.075
(sniffs)
(growls)

02:34.322 --> 02:37.191
What?
I softened him up.

02:37.224 --> 02:40.561
You better keep out
of my way, Spike. I'm not gonna
take this much longer.

02:40.593 --> 02:45.064
And I should do what with
my spare time? Sit at home
knitting cunning sweater sets?

02:45.098 --> 02:47.835
Would it keep you
out of my way?
She's right.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.503
You shouldn't
be out here when
she's patrolling.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.873
Oh! I saw that.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.246
Looks like neither boy
is entirely welcome.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.080
You should
take him home, Slayer,
make him stay there.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.849
I've got
knitting needles
he can borrow.

03:02.883 --> 03:08.921
Spike, I just saw you
taste your own nose blood.
You know what?

03:08.955 --> 03:13.193
I'm too grossed out to hear
anything you have to say.
Go home.

03:15.795 --> 03:19.098
It's blood.
It's what I do.

03:20.933 --> 03:25.004
Hey, hope I didn't
get in the way.
Of course not.

03:25.038 --> 03:30.210
I was just startled,
and you know I don't
love the idea

03:30.243 --> 03:32.513
of you
patrolling alone.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.584
Not much
for benchwarming.
No. You made the squad.

03:36.616 --> 03:41.521
You threw that vampire
like he was a teeny-weeny
little vampire.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.525
Hey, you want to go again?
Come on. I bet this place
is just teeming

03:44.557 --> 03:47.594
with aerodynamic
vampires.

03:47.627 --> 03:52.932
Nah. Unless you want to
go back and kill Spike
for the fun of it.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.908
I will know
your blood, Slayer.

04:03.175 --> 04:05.846
I will make
your neck my chalice...

04:06.947 --> 04:08.748
and drink deep.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.752
(sniffs)

04:15.155 --> 04:15.989
Ow!

04:17.524 --> 04:18.992
(theme music playing)

05:11.711 --> 05:13.480
You can't
possibly be arguing

05:13.514 --> 05:16.850
that Marat didn't betray
the French revolutionaries.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.687
This was the guy who
declared the rights of man,

05:19.720 --> 05:24.324
and then the next thing you
know, he's killing Girondin
like it's going out of style.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.894
Wil, you're totally missing
my point. Now, I agree that
Marat wasn't a real martyr.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.363
But the death in the tub,
the neck wound,

05:30.398 --> 05:33.667
all that blood-- just a little
more fangy than knifey.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.803
And Charlotte Corday wasn't
a real martyr either, but...
Buffy.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.206
What?
Listen to us.
We're arguing.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.810
We're having a debate
about a college lecture.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.079
I have dreamt of this day
since... forever.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.850
You are turning into
quite the student.

05:49.882 --> 05:52.720
Should I be watching
my occipital lobe?

05:52.752 --> 05:55.187
Your what?
Occipital.

05:55.221 --> 05:59.158
The lobe in the back of
your brain. You know, like,
should I be watching my back?

05:59.192 --> 06:03.262
But, you know,
the back of your brain.

06:03.295 --> 06:05.999
Apparently not.
Don't worry, Wil.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.035
You still wear
the smarty-pants in the family.

06:08.067 --> 06:13.005
I don't know. You've been
studying really a lot.
I'm trying.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.108
They're already piling
on all the reading,
and Giles fills

06:15.141 --> 06:17.845
any free time I have
with extra training.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.346
I'm starting to think
this working hard is hard work.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.216
Isn't it crazy like that?
I thought it was gonna
be like in the movies.

06:23.250 --> 06:27.086
You know,
inspirational music, a montage,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.956
me sharpening my pencils,
me reading, writing,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.625
falling asleep on a big pile
of books with my glasses
all crooked--

06:32.659 --> 06:34.427
'cause in my montage,
I have glasses--

06:34.461 --> 06:38.699
But real life is slow,
and it's starting to
hurt my occipital lobe.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.067
Oh. Poor Buffy's brain.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.370
Actually, I'm heading to
training right now. You want to
come with?

06:43.403 --> 06:46.906
I'm in. Maybe we can
argue some more about
the French Revolution.

06:46.939 --> 06:50.978
Hey! Wasn't that Robespierre
the coolest?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.545
Robespierre? You're
kidding me, right?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.814
I'm just
gettin' it goin'.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.651
GILES: It seems the plans
worked perfectly.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.053
Yeah, blueprints.
Not a bad idea.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.956
That and getting straight
"measure twice, cut once."

07:03.990 --> 07:07.627
You know, for the longest time,
I had it backwards. Messy.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.329
Well, I must say,
I'm very impressed.

07:10.362 --> 07:13.934
Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool.
(knocking)

07:17.771 --> 07:21.841
Oh! Who put the monkey head
near the Styx water?

07:21.875 --> 07:25.478
Do we want to
pick exploded monkey
out of our hair?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.682
Trick or treat!
Hi, you two.
Come on in.

07:28.716 --> 07:32.185
Thank you,
kind proprietor.
Hey, you.

07:32.218 --> 07:36.524
Hey! Oh, wow.
This place looks great.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.492
Oh, I feel like a witch
in a magic shop.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.430
Oh. Are these
real newt eyes?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.798
No. Too rich for my blood,
I'm afraid.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.435
No, these are
salamander eyes.
It's the cataracts

07:48.468 --> 07:50.603
which give them their
newt-like appearance.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.505
They're really
equally effective though.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.007
It's just a matter
of overcoming snobbery.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.343
XANDER: I'm tellin' you,
Giles. You gotta set up
a blind taste test

07:57.377 --> 08:00.312
and prove once and for all
that generic amphibian eyeballs
are just as good.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.750
I don't know. If you ask me,
the newt name still
means something.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.153
You ready to train?
You betcha.

08:07.187 --> 08:11.024
Shall we then?
We shall then.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.560
I just keep thinking
how cool it would be

08:13.593 --> 08:17.396
if we got a real psychic
to sit up here and read fortunes
and stuff.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.699
You should do it.

08:19.733 --> 08:24.572
Not me, but I'd love
to watch and learn from someone
who's really good, you know?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.807
You're really good.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.776
I'll prove it.
Here. Do me.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.687
Hmm.
What do you see?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.423
Willow hand.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.599
(Buffy grunts)

08:52.198 --> 08:54.400
Ow! Riley!

08:54.433 --> 08:57.070
Just keeping you
on your toes.
Or off them, as it were.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.938
What got into--

09:00.440 --> 09:04.311
Oh, my god.
Look at this place.

09:09.548 --> 09:13.352
-Thank you.
Thank you so much.
-It's just a start.

09:13.385 --> 09:16.188
You need a proper space
to train, so--
I love it.

09:16.222 --> 09:21.394
So, come on.
Let's test this puppy out.
Think you can take me?

09:21.427 --> 09:23.897
What's the matter?
Afraid of a little
competition?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.432
This must've been
so much work.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.970
I'm the dummy man.
I mean, I made the dummy--

09:30.003 --> 09:33.974
The thing that you hit
that doesn't hit back--
that, uh, I made.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.809
It's great.
It's all great.

09:36.844 --> 09:40.547
Well, you've earned it. Truly.
Thank you, guys, so much.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.884
You're like
my fairy godmother
and Santa Claus

09:43.917 --> 09:46.352
and "Q" all wrapped up
into one.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.590
"Q" from Bond,
not Star Trek.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.461
I'm gonna go change.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.767
(panting)

10:02.970 --> 10:04.336
Oh, Pacey!

10:04.370 --> 10:07.274
You blind idiot.
Can't you see
she doesn't love you?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.375
(pounding on door)

10:11.711 --> 10:13.212
(door unlatching)

10:15.682 --> 10:18.851
Well, well, well.
Lookee here.
Is it safe?

10:18.885 --> 10:21.520
Has Buffy
gotten to you yet?

10:21.553 --> 10:24.624
I saw her patrolling
just now... with a stake.

10:24.658 --> 10:28.495
She won't give up
until she's
killed me to death.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.831
Buffy's looking for you?
Of course.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.334
That's why
I'm on the lam.

10:34.366 --> 10:38.270
Didn't you hear?
I'm totally
her arch nemesis.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.607
Is that right?
I must've missed the memo.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.278
There was a mem--
(exhales)
Spike, oh, my god!

10:45.312 --> 10:47.815
This is, like,
a real emergency.

10:49.015 --> 10:54.120
I need a hideout so bad.
You're my only hope.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.924
We're just gonna
have to rise above
our petty differences.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.697
Listen, Spike.
I'm desperate.

11:04.865 --> 11:09.568
Desperate, are you?
Come on, Spike.

11:09.601 --> 11:11.971
Pretty please?

11:12.004 --> 11:16.643
I'll do anything.
Anything, will you?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.211
Yeah. I said
I'll do anything.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.216
Oh.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.286
You mean, will I
have sex with you?

11:27.754 --> 11:28.956
Well, yeah.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.437
Taking up smoking,
are you?

11:45.471 --> 11:48.741
I am a villain,
Spike. Hello.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.510
coughing)
I guess you are at that--

11:51.543 --> 11:57.384
(wheezing)
What with the Slayer
on your tail and all.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.953
She's not the type to give up
either. She'll hunt you down,
day and night,

12:00.988 --> 12:04.892
till you're too tired
and too hungry
to run anymore.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.294
And then--

12:08.327 --> 12:11.398
Then, that is you.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.601
I guess you're gonna
have to kill her.

12:15.634 --> 12:20.072
I tried.
It was all hard and stuff.

12:20.106 --> 12:23.943
You do it.
I'd love to.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.546
But I can't, remember?

12:26.578 --> 12:29.149
I've got this cute
little government chip
in my head.

12:29.182 --> 12:34.086
All right.
Guess it'll have to
be me after all.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.123
Can you help
with the thinking?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.594
Yeah, I suppose
I could do that.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.399
Mm.
Yeah.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.668
Mm.
That was relaxing.

12:51.471 --> 12:55.341
You, uh, want to
relax some more?
Again?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.778
Right away again?

12:58.812 --> 13:04.150
Maybe you're too tired.
Hey, I have
the endurance of 10 men.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.320
Let's make it women, okay?
Just for the imagery.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.990
Whatever. You know,
it takes a lot
to wear me out.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.961
Mm, I love
a challenge.
Mm.

13:16.495 --> 13:20.133
Well, wouldn't you?
Every kid tries to
make the substitute cry.

13:20.167 --> 13:24.136
It's like
a rite of passage.
I certainly would not.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.975
Being a substitute
is an extremely
difficult job. Besides--

13:28.008 --> 13:31.510
Honestly, Dawn. How many
bowls of cereal are you
planning on eating?

13:32.644 --> 13:34.181
Oh, these aren't
for eating.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.582
I'm just trying to get
the extra out of the way,
so I could...

13:38.585 --> 13:40.552
get this.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.289
Anyway, I want eggs.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.225
You want the cereal prize,
but you don't want
the cereal.

13:46.259 --> 13:51.463
You are growing up.
All righty.
Half an omelet coming up.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.067
Oh, um, with ketchup,
if you please.
Mm-hmm.

13:57.904 --> 14:01.207
Oh, what is the--
Who are you?

14:03.576 --> 14:06.013
Oh!

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
(panting)

14:09.282 --> 14:12.251
(whimpering)

14:13.519 --> 14:15.087
(touch-tones beeping)

14:17.124 --> 14:20.894
(woman over PA,
indistinct)

14:22.129 --> 14:26.666
Hey, how's mom?
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

14:26.698 --> 14:29.668
And your mom's
doing just fine.

14:29.701 --> 14:34.407
This is Ben.
He gave me his stethoscope.
Lent you his stethoscope.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.844
Buffy, right? I'm Ben.
I'm an intern here.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.678
I've had the pleasure
of hanging out

14:39.711 --> 14:42.249
with the renowned Dr. Dawn here
while your mom's being tested.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.418
So, what's goin' on?
What happened?
Well, she's doing okay now.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.553
The doctors don't really know
what caused the collapse.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.289
(faint) It could've just been
a dizzy spell, low blood sugar,
that sort of thing.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.293
But it's nothing bad?
I mean, it's not serious,
right?

14:53.326 --> 14:57.264
(faint) Very unlikely.
So, your mom doesn't
have a history of fainting?

14:57.297 --> 15:00.933
(regular heartbeat)
BUFFY: No, not that I know of.
She's usually really healthy.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.403
Well, I think they'll
be running tests
for a few more hours,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.738
and then they'll probably want
her to come back for some
follow-up tests

15:05.772 --> 15:08.607
in a couple weeks,
but it really doesn't
look like anything too serious.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.044
(full volume)
Thank god.
I was freaking out.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.147
(Ben, faint) I think you'll
be able to take her home
before too long.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.316
(racing heartbeat)
That's definitely
good news.

15:22.522 --> 15:26.658
I know I'm repeating myself
here, but I don't know what else
to say to convince you.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.761
I have never,
in all my years of medicine,
let a patient

15:29.796 --> 15:32.798
with tachycardia
this severe
leave a hospital.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.668
You said you
couldn't keep me.
Legally, no.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.605
I can't force you to
do a thing, but with that pulse,
believe me,

15:39.639 --> 15:42.741
I'd get on my knees
and beg you if I thought
I could change your mind.

15:42.774 --> 15:46.980
You can't. I'm goin' home.
And your friend here
can't convince you to--

15:47.014 --> 15:49.581
I'm going.

15:49.615 --> 15:54.354
All right, then.
But you're leaving
against my recommendation.

15:57.956 --> 16:02.095
What's going on?
What are you doing? What if
you have a heart attack?

16:02.129 --> 16:07.700
Listen to me. Calm down.
Me, calm down? I'm not the one
with the pulse of 150.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.303
My heart's different than yours,
Buffy. It works differently now,
but it's okay.

16:11.337 --> 16:15.107
But you're still
a human, Riley. You could still
have a heart attack.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.777
I'm a human who was
used as a lab rat
for months.

16:17.809 --> 16:20.547
(door opens)
Hi.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.182
Hey. How are you?

16:23.216 --> 16:27.787
Oh. Embarrassed mostly.
I'm sorry to put you
through this,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.657
but no more tests,
so you can take
this pincushion home.

16:30.690 --> 16:35.861
Yes. Let's, uh,
get out of here.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.407
What about a crossword?
Some people say feed a cold.
I say puzzle it.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.344
Oh, no thanks, Willow.
I like chicken fingers
with mustard when I'm sick.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.147
I know you do, sweetie.
I can make us some later.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.317
Uh, uh-un. You are
sitting right here
on this couch today.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.254
I feel silly
lying here like a lump.
You could make a game out of it.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.423
A very quiet game
about being a lump.

17:04.457 --> 17:09.261
I feel fine. Honestly,
I'm more concerned about Riley
than I am about me.

17:09.296 --> 17:14.267
You shouldn't even be thinking
about that. He's not worried,
so I don't think we should be.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.836
I don't get
what he's thinking.
Why isn't he worried?

17:17.868 --> 17:22.409
Maybe he thinks
his body can handle it.
He is in really good shape.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.045
Nobody's body can
handle a heart attack.
I know.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.382
I'm sorry, Buffy.
I'm trying too hard
to make it okay.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.719
I just keep coming back
to the Initiative.

17:32.751 --> 17:36.722
It does have that icky
government feel to it.
Did you know that one time,

17:36.756 --> 17:39.959
the CIA
tried to kill Fidel Castro
with a poisonous aspirin?

17:39.991 --> 17:42.194
Dawn, please.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.064
(sighs) I know
I have to do something.
I just don't know what.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.233
Another time, the CIA--
Dawn!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.934
It's important.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.240
Tried to make Castro go crazy
by putting itching powder
in his beard.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.676
It's about the government.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.113
Call the Initiative.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.948
If they know
what's wrong with him,
they have to help.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.785
Yeah, but call them how?
First of all, they
don't exist anymore,

18:05.817 --> 18:09.455
and secondly, they
never claimed to exist
in the first place.

18:09.489 --> 18:14.326
It's so unfair.
It's like Big Brother can
spy on you all the time,

18:14.361 --> 18:17.430
and the second
I have something to say,
no one will listen.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.799
Sounds more
like Big Sister.
There has to be a way.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.336
Like what?
Take a tour
of the White House,

18:23.369 --> 18:26.405
and pretend to get lost,
and look for some door
with a sign on it

18:26.439 --> 18:28.840
that says:
"Secret Government
Monster Hunters"?

18:28.875 --> 18:32.511
If they're really spying on you
all the time, just say something
so you know they'll hear you.

18:32.545 --> 18:36.516
Like sometimes, I write
fake things in my diary
in case--

18:36.548 --> 18:39.852
I gotta go.
Uh, see you guys later.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.392
(door opening)
What'd I say?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.694
Riley?

18:59.471 --> 19:03.309
(dial tone,
clicking)

19:03.343 --> 19:06.378
Riley's in trouble.
He needs help.

19:10.317 --> 19:14.621
Kick it up!
(guys shouting,
chattering, indistinct)

19:14.653 --> 19:19.659
Oh, kick it up!
Kick it! Go on! Go on! Go on!

19:19.692 --> 19:23.395
Hit it!
Are you kidding?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.498
(indistinct yelling)

19:26.766 --> 19:29.402
Help.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.973
(arguing,
indistinct)
I'm out.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.042
(ball dribbling)
Let's go.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.248
(sighs)
Graham.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.914
Riley.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.250
Can we talk?

19:47.253 --> 19:49.188
Agent Goodman,
Agent Brown.
(Riley exhales)

19:49.221 --> 19:53.058
So, talk.
What's goin' on, man?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.926
We gotta get this
taken care of immediately.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.998
We gotta get you
into an operating room.
Very convincing.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.933
Makes me completely want
to put myself under
government control.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.438
Please take me to
where they can make me
unconscious and naked.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.275
Hey, you think I'd
pull somethin' on you?
You're still in. I'm out.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.042
I don't know what orders
you're followin'.
Oh, come on.

20:11.076 --> 20:15.882
You know Walsh pumped all those
chemicals and crap into us.
You got more than anyone.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.916
She messed us up bad.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.387
Now the government's
knockin' themselves out
to kiss it and make it better.

20:21.421 --> 20:26.192
Riley, I'm tellin' you.
You need help. I'm not
sayin' it to trick you.

20:26.224 --> 20:30.028
Well, maybe
you even believe it.
I know it.

20:30.061 --> 20:31.963
You don't want this.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.135
You sure you got
the fix for it?
Yeah.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.471
We got a guy,
a doctor.

20:39.506 --> 20:43.375
He's gonna take care of you,
and we're goin' to him now.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.412
I'm not
givin' you a choice.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.682
Guess you're not.

21:02.862 --> 21:06.333
So, you messed up and he's gone,
and when are you even gonna
tell me what's wrong with him?

21:06.365 --> 21:09.736
I'm not
permitted to say.
Say.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.672
Hyper-adrenal overload
and a bunch of stuff that
sounds even worse than that,

21:12.704 --> 21:15.974
and all it means is he's
way stronger than he ought
to be and feeling no pain.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.178
His heart can't take it.
We've been at him
for weeks about it.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.916
There's a specialist waiting
at Sunnydale General,
fourth floor, neurology.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.086
Get Riley there,
'cause if you don't--
I'll get him there.

21:28.119 --> 21:30.056
I'll tell the Doc.

21:32.724 --> 21:36.162
And, Buffy--
If you tell me to hurry,

21:36.194 --> 21:39.198
I'll kick your ass.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.989
Poor Riley.
Could he simply have
gone back to his apartment?

22:03.021 --> 22:05.290
No. He's not
at his apartment.
He's not at the gym.

22:05.324 --> 22:09.161
He's not at the library.
He's gone somewhere where he
doesn't want to be found.

22:09.194 --> 22:12.731
So, basically,
he's gone AWOL.
Basically, exactly.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.835
Poor Buffy.
Maybe he just needs
some time alone.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.704
Like, I had this friend once
who really liked this girl,

22:18.738 --> 22:21.574
and he got all worried that
maybe she didn't like him back,

22:21.607 --> 22:25.243
and maybe that made him
act like a total jerk.

22:25.277 --> 22:29.915
Maybe Riley reminds me
of that friend.
What are you talking about?

22:31.349 --> 22:34.252
Then again, maybe not.
Maybe he just
wants attention.

22:34.286 --> 22:37.189
Well, here's a hot tip.
If you want attention, be there
so people can give it to you.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.227
I care about you,
Xander.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.994
Thanks.

22:43.028 --> 22:48.401
Don't be insecure.
Thanks. I won't.

22:48.434 --> 22:52.704
'Cause I also have
this "friend," and I have it
on really good authority

22:52.739 --> 22:57.242
that she really likes
that guy, your "friend,"
and by the by, my friend--

22:57.276 --> 23:00.880
You guys, enough!
Okay, Riley is in
real danger here.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.284
Anya, Xander,
why don't you guys
check the docks?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.787
Aye, aye.

23:07.819 --> 23:11.590
Tara and I can scope out
the burned-out school.
Riley hid there once.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.359
Maybe he feels
it's homey or something.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.028
Homey.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.967
You know what else he might
find homey in a dank,
unpleasant, evil sort of way?

23:21.000 --> 23:25.637
The Initiative caves,
but I don't
know them too well.

23:25.672 --> 23:30.643
We do have an associate who
knows those caves like the back
of his melanin-deprived hand.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.211
I so don't want to deal
with Spike right now.

23:33.244 --> 23:35.314
Guy is really
starting to bug me
in that special

23:35.346 --> 23:38.084
I-want-to-shove-something-
wooden-through-his-heart
kind of way.

23:38.116 --> 23:40.653
He does seem
extra twitchy lately.

23:40.686 --> 23:43.255
Maybe the whole
"not killing"
is gettin' to him.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.825
Plus,
hanging out all day
in that moldy crypt.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.595
You just know he's
doing something nasty.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.931
Okay. Is it bigger
than a bread box?

23:51.963 --> 23:56.335
No. Four left.
So it's smaller
than a bread box?

23:56.367 --> 23:58.538
No. Only three.

24:00.038 --> 24:03.108
Harmony, is it
a sodding bread box?

24:03.142 --> 24:05.678
Yes! Oh, my god!
Someone's blondie bear

24:05.711 --> 24:08.780
is a 20-question genius.
(pounding on door)

24:08.815 --> 24:10.682
She's found me.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.795
I've got
a proposition for you.
Funny.

24:22.828 --> 24:26.298
I've got a proposition
for you. What about knocking?
Seems only fair.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.934
Since we vamps can't enter
your flat without an invite,
you could at least--

24:28.968 --> 24:31.770
Say, look at those
pretty pieces of paper.
Riley's sick with some

24:31.804 --> 24:34.272
Initiative thing,
and he's missing. I think
he might be in the caves.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.375
You find him, bring him
to the fourth floor
of the hospital,

24:36.407 --> 24:39.679
their doctors get
to him in time,
you get the cash.

24:39.711 --> 24:43.782
Oh, dear.
Is the enormous
hall monitor sick?

24:43.816 --> 24:49.556
Tell me, is he gonna die?
He is not the only
person that can die.

24:49.588 --> 24:53.325
Hey, I'm just sayin',
if it's really
that important to you,

24:53.358 --> 24:56.162
I think
I'll get half now.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.638
(stone scraping)

25:06.673 --> 25:10.742
(gasping)
So? What'd she say about me?

25:11.743 --> 25:14.881
(woman over PA,
indistinct)

25:21.753 --> 25:25.592
Any word?
They'll be here
any minute.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.095
That's soon enough, right?
I mean, if we
bring him in now?

25:29.127 --> 25:32.064
I'll be honest.
I'm not sure
it's soon enough

25:32.097 --> 25:34.866
if you brought him
in yesterday.

25:35.934 --> 25:38.237
(tapping on door)
Finally.

25:54.052 --> 25:57.824
You got yourself
a new patient, Doc.

26:04.663 --> 26:07.733
(insects chirping)

26:22.114 --> 26:24.215
Look,
you don't understand.

26:24.250 --> 26:28.855
This is a complicated
neurological procedure, and I've
never performed it before.

26:30.521 --> 26:33.759
Little performance anxiety,
eh, Doc?

26:33.792 --> 26:36.895
Butterflies
in the old belly?

26:36.929 --> 26:39.431
Harm, do us a favor.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.468
Shoot the nasty butterflies
for the good doctor.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.807
There you go, Doc.
It's not so complicated.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.111
Just do whatever those
initiative lab monkeys did,
only backwards.

26:52.144 --> 26:55.647
This is a medical school,
not a proper operating
facility.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.084
And these instruments--

26:58.116 --> 27:01.019
SPIKE: They look
pointy enough. They'll do.

27:03.122 --> 27:08.928
You're not listening.
That chip is deeply embedded
in your cerebral cortex.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.096
Removing it could leave you
a vegetable.

27:11.130 --> 27:16.567
That's not gonna happen, mate.
See, I have faith
in your survival instinct.

27:21.406 --> 27:25.477
Yeah, you'll
have me up and killing
before the night's over.

27:27.145 --> 27:32.684
Come on, Doc.
You do me right, nothing
bad'll happen to you.

27:36.587 --> 27:38.724
Oops.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.160
String was slippy.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.330
WILLOW: Riley!

27:46.432 --> 27:48.701
This place kind of
creeps me out.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.738
You should've been here
when it was a school.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.039
Riley!

27:55.406 --> 27:58.810
Oof. Darkness.

27:58.845 --> 28:02.381
Piles of it.
We should've brought
a flashlight.

28:02.413 --> 28:07.720
Ooh, I know.
Better to light a candle
than curse the damn darkness.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.288
A little spell.

28:10.521 --> 28:12.290
Fiat lux.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.962
Whoa.
There.
That's better.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.532
Riley, come on out!

28:22.534 --> 28:24.536
How'd you do that,
with the light?

28:24.569 --> 28:27.239
Oh, you know.
You taught me.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.340
I taught you
teeny Tinker Bell light.

28:29.375 --> 28:33.179
Okay, so I tinkered
with the Tinker Bell.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.115
It was easy. And besides,
isn't this better

28:36.147 --> 28:39.751
than using a flashlight
like some kind of doofus?

28:39.786 --> 28:42.453
Riley?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.891
Riley, answer me.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.492
Please.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.931
Riley?

28:59.105 --> 29:03.776
You know, this
doesn't even hurt.
Your hand is bleeding.

29:03.809 --> 29:09.615
Don't feel a thing.
This stops now.
I'm taking you to the doctor.

29:09.647 --> 29:14.854
The one from the government,
you mean? Like the ones who did
this to me in the first place?

29:14.953 --> 29:17.256
He's the only one
that understands
what's wrong with you.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.925
He's the only one
that can help.
What's wrong with me?

29:19.959 --> 29:23.128
I'm more powerful than I've
ever been, Buffy. Most people
would kill to feel this way.

29:23.162 --> 29:26.332
Yeah, and this feeling
is going to kill you.

29:26.365 --> 29:30.435
Riley, your body was not built
for this kind of stress.
I can handle it.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.806
This is my deal, Buffy.
Just... back off.

29:36.808 --> 29:42.147
What is this?
What's happening to you?

29:42.181 --> 29:46.585
I go back, let the government
get whimsical with
my innards again.

29:46.617 --> 29:48.354
They could
do anything that--

29:48.386 --> 29:54.926
Best-case scenario--
they turn me into Joe normal,
just-- just another guy.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.163
And that's
not enough for you?

29:58.529 --> 30:00.731
It's not enough for you.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.003
Why would you say that?
Come on.

30:05.037 --> 30:10.541
Your last boyfriend
wasn't exactly a civilian.
So, that's what this is about?

30:10.576 --> 30:13.980
You're going to die over
some macho pissing contest?

30:14.012 --> 30:16.182
It's not about him.
It's about us.

30:17.983 --> 30:21.720
You're getting stronger
every day, more powerful.

30:21.752 --> 30:26.992
I can't touch you. Every day,
you're just a little further
out of my reach.

30:28.193 --> 30:32.030
You wanna touch me?
I'm right here.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.433
I'm not the one running away.
Not yet.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.637
So, you have this
all figured out?

30:39.671 --> 30:42.240
I'm bailing because you're
not in the super club.

30:43.910 --> 30:48.579
It's human nature.
Don't Psych 101 me.

30:48.614 --> 30:52.518
Not now. Not after
everything that--

30:56.587 --> 31:02.094
Nobody has ever known me
the way you do. Nobody.

31:02.127 --> 31:06.765
I've opened up
to you in ways that
I've never opened up to--

31:06.798 --> 31:09.867
God, you're just sitting
back there

31:09.902 --> 31:12.070
thinking that none of this
means anything to me.

31:12.104 --> 31:16.674
I never said that.
Because it obviously doesn't
mean anything to you.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.010
Do you think
so little of me--
Buffy.

31:19.045 --> 31:23.548
No! No.

31:23.582 --> 31:28.119
Do you think that I spent
the last year with you
because you had super powers?

31:28.153 --> 31:31.958
If that's what I wanted,
then I'd be dating Spike.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.996
Riley, I need you.

31:41.099 --> 31:47.439
I need you with me,
and I need you healthy.

31:47.472 --> 31:51.576
But if you wanna
throw it all away because
you don't trust me, then--

31:54.480 --> 31:58.817
Then I am still gonna
make you go to that doctor.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.762
Take me to him.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.002
We have to hurry.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.977
Loving you
is the scariest thing
I've ever done, Buffy.

32:26.877 --> 32:29.681
I don't know why.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.288
The doctor said
we didn't have much time.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.561
(squishing)

32:46.231 --> 32:48.433
I read in a magazine
that some women think

32:48.467 --> 32:50.501
a man's real sex organ
is his brain.

32:52.003 --> 32:56.174
Yuck. No contest.
I mean, look at it.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.545
It's so... pink
and wriggly looking.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.648
Can I touch it?
BOTH: No!

33:03.682 --> 33:06.417
Oh, my god.
You're awake?
Local anesthetic.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.489
Wow, Spikey.
How does it feel?

33:10.521 --> 33:14.660
Like someone's cutting
into my brain with a knife,
you silly bint.

33:14.692 --> 33:17.863
Hmm. You know
what it means

33:17.895 --> 33:20.398
that he can't hurt
any living thing?

33:20.432 --> 33:23.734
It means he can't
even pick flowers.
What? Yes, I can.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.505
Please be quiet.

33:27.873 --> 33:31.809
Mm. Is it supposed
to do that?
Please.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.680
For god's sake,
please be quiet.

33:34.712 --> 33:39.151
Listen, buster,
I don't see a crossbow
in your hands, okay?

33:39.184 --> 33:43.154
Harmony,
if your incessant prattling
bollixes up this operation,

33:43.189 --> 33:46.291
I'm gonna personally
yank out your pink
and wriggly tongue.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.596
What are you looking at?

33:50.628 --> 33:53.365
(woman over PA,
indistinct)

33:53.398 --> 33:56.167
Uh-oh.
Graham? Graham?

33:56.201 --> 33:58.104
(grunting)

33:59.305 --> 34:02.307
How many fingers
I got up?
Seventeen.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.077
GRAHAM: Hostile 17
and a blonde girl.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.045
Spike and Harmony
together again.

34:11.047 --> 34:13.351
Where's
Dr. Overheiser?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.753
Spike must've
taken him.

34:15.786 --> 34:19.190
What would Spike
want with-- The chip.

34:19.224 --> 34:23.527
He's gonna force the doctor to
remove the chip from his brain.
(groans)

34:23.561 --> 34:28.199
Riley?
I'm okay. Okay.

34:28.233 --> 34:32.503
We're running out of time.
If we don't find the medic soon,
he's not gonna make it.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.574
Okay. Okay. Brain surgery.

34:36.608 --> 34:41.213
He's gonna need
a medical facility.
He's gonna need equipment.

34:41.246 --> 34:45.717
It's a big hospital.
No. Uh-un. He wouldn't
do it here. It's too risky.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.621
We'll split up. Graham,
get on the horn or the pipe
or whatever you guys get on.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.190
I want you to check
animal hospitals,
doctors' offices.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.494
Hey, about before--
GRAHAM: We're good.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.429
Apologize later,
if you're not dead.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.170
You are not going to die.

35:04.202 --> 35:07.139
Bet you say that
to all the boys.
No.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.974
But there is one peroxided pest
whose number's up.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.643
When I get my hands on Spike,
I'm gonna rip his head off.
I'm gonna--

35:12.677 --> 35:16.981
Bathe in the Slayer's blood.
I'm gonna dive in it.

35:17.014 --> 35:20.719
Swim in it. I'm gonna
do the bloody backstroke.

35:26.391 --> 35:29.260
I see it, Spikey!
I see the chip.

35:29.295 --> 35:33.431
It's nestled in there like
a pretty little Easter egg,
with your brain all around it,

35:33.465 --> 35:37.835
like that green,
plastic, grassy stuff,
only this is more of a beige--

35:37.869 --> 35:41.507
Would you please
put out that cigarette?
It's really not allowed.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.875
Oh, yeah? Says who?

35:47.144 --> 35:50.416
Oh, god, sorry.
Didn't see the sign.

35:52.518 --> 35:57.054
(clattering)
The chip's out.
I didn't think I could do it.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.226
It just-- it's out.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.293
Yeah?
Yay!

36:02.327 --> 36:06.731
Yay for Spikey!
Right, then.

36:06.764 --> 36:10.235
Stitch me up, Doc.
Got places to go.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.905
And Slayers to kill.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.753
Listen to me.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.922
My stomach's growling.
I'm so starved.

36:30.956 --> 36:35.092
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
have me a little snack.

36:39.731 --> 36:44.769
Oh, don't worry.
I won't fill up
on the bread.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.739
I'll still
have plenty of room
for the main course.

36:48.773 --> 36:50.442
(door opening)

36:54.079 --> 36:55.780
Slayer!

37:03.989 --> 37:06.592
(panting)

37:06.625 --> 37:08.327
Suit up, Harm.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.967
Stay here.
We're gonna need you.
SPIKE: Buffy.

37:16.001 --> 37:20.539
I swear I was just
thinking of you. I wanted to
tell you the great news.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.974
My head's all clear now.
No more bug-zapper in my noggin.

37:24.009 --> 37:27.579
Means I get to kill you.
You get to try.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.989
Oops.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.824
(growling)

37:42.827 --> 37:44.463
(shrieks)

38:02.146 --> 38:04.882
At long last.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.853
(grunts)

38:10.288 --> 38:12.858
(howls)

38:21.900 --> 38:23.434
(yelps)

38:23.469 --> 38:24.635
Riley!

38:30.742 --> 38:31.976
Riley.

38:38.717 --> 38:42.487
A penny.
I told you
I couldn't do it.

38:42.521 --> 38:46.190
Oh, god. Doctor!
Doctor, we need you now!
(Spike growls)

38:53.398 --> 38:55.634
(straining)

38:55.666 --> 38:59.237
Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!
Everywhere I turn,
she's there.

38:59.269 --> 39:03.875
That nasty little face,
that fancy
shampoo-commercial hair.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.177
That whole sodding
holier-than-thou attitude.

39:06.210 --> 39:09.079
Aren't we unholy by definition?
She follows me, you know,
tracks me down.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.550
I'm her pet project.
Drive Spike round the bend.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.786
Makes every day
a fresh bout of torture.

39:18.222 --> 39:21.726
Spike!
You don't understand.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.197
I can't get rid of her.
She's everywhere.
She's haunting me, Harmony.

39:32.137 --> 39:35.773
This has got to end.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.646
All patched up.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.661
How's it going in there?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.697
Good.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.298
Back to normal.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.806
Yep.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.077
And see?

40:13.311 --> 40:16.414
I'm still touchable.

40:16.447 --> 40:20.686
Give me a week or so to heal,
and I'll take full advantage
of that fact.

40:25.255 --> 40:28.527
Are you gonna be okay?
'Cause I should really
go check on my mom.

40:31.128 --> 40:34.666
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.
I'll be fine.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.936
I'll talk to you later.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.824
It's a good thing Buffy
found you when she did,

40:58.856 --> 41:01.092
'cause you were about
to detonate big time.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.829
Always said
she's pretty impressive.

41:03.862 --> 41:07.532
You know, she really is.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.434
But you know you don't
belong here, right?
This town.

41:10.467 --> 41:14.773
I mean,
you're nothing here.
Hey.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.175
What are you saying?
Come on, man.
You know it's true.

41:18.208 --> 41:19.878
There's nothing
for you here.

41:21.146 --> 41:25.050
There's her.
Okay, right.
There's her. And?

41:25.083 --> 41:28.887
You used to have a mission,
and now you're what,
the mission's boyfriend?

41:30.088 --> 41:33.023
The mission's true love?

41:38.730 --> 41:41.365
You belong with us.

41:43.768 --> 41:46.204
(banging)

41:50.340 --> 41:52.978
Should've known it's you.
Been nearly six hours.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.246
Would've been less
if I wasn't busy
cleaning up your mess.

41:55.280 --> 41:59.585
My mess? I just
borrowed the Doc.

41:59.617 --> 42:02.519
The mess is yours, Slayer.
Yours and the boy's.

42:04.255 --> 42:09.594
I'm done. Spike,
you're a killer.

42:09.628 --> 42:12.097
And I should've
done this years ago.

42:14.231 --> 42:17.936
You know what? Do it.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.606
Bloody just do it.
What?

42:20.639 --> 42:23.942
End my torment.

42:23.974 --> 42:29.047
Seeing you every day,
everywhere I go,
every time I turn around.

42:29.079 --> 42:32.617
Take me out of a world
that has you in it.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.721
Just kill me.

42:48.099 --> 42:50.001
(grunts)

43:14.525 --> 43:17.262
Spike, I want you.

43:17.295 --> 43:20.931
Buffy, I love you.
God, I love you so much.

43:20.965 --> 43:23.367
(gasps)

43:26.536 --> 43:28.172
Oh, god, no.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.010
Please, no.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.844
(Spike sighs)

44:08.813 --> 44:11.215
Grr! Arrgh!
