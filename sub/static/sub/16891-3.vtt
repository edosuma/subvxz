Hey, man. Come on, you don't
hear everybody yelling for ya?

00:04.492 --> 00:05.839
We're all on the rig waiting.
I ain't going.

00:05.959 --> 00:07.674
You know some way around
taking the annual physical?

00:07.794 --> 00:10.386
If I take the medical,
they'll pull me off duty.

00:10.506 --> 00:12.779
Get on the rig. Ok. We'll figure
something out on the way downtown.

00:12.899 --> 00:17.630
125/80. That's a major
improvement over last year, lt. Shea.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.539
You're doing very well, lt. Shea.

00:19.659 --> 00:20.803
Just a few more
questions, lieutenant.

00:20.923 --> 00:22.587
Oh, I'm not a lieutenant.

00:22.707 --> 00:24.041
I mean, yes, I'm a lieutenant.

00:24.161 --> 00:26.163
What the hell are you doing
locking me out of this building?

00:26.283 --> 00:27.771
This isn't the medical building.

00:27.891 --> 00:30.113
Uh, I just came out of here.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.379
What the hell is going on?

00:33.050 --> 00:34.445
Will you marry me?

00:34.565 --> 00:36.185
Yes.

00:36.305 --> 00:37.417
What's going on?

00:37.487 --> 00:39.958
Um, I got cancer.

00:40.078 --> 00:41.692
Is it serious?

00:42.831 --> 00:44.153
It's cancer.

00:44.273 --> 00:45.927

For what?
The Jimmy thing.

00:48.827 --> 00:49.762
What Jimmy thing?

00:49.882 --> 00:53.079
The news piece they're doing on Jimmy.
Relax. It's ok. This is a good thing.

00:53.199 --> 00:54.267

00:54.336 --> 00:55.669

Well, you know, Frankie, as
much as I appreciate

what you and the boys did for me, it's
kind of par for the course,

05:19.678 --> 05:24.201
stepping up for a brother in need.
Kinda of like what we did for you

05:24.321 --> 05:26.482
when those guys came
over here looking to kick your ass

05:26.551 --> 05:29.552
after you spouted your
little conspiracy theories.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.121
All right, first of all, Lou,
those aren't my theories.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.448
I think you know that.
Second of all, I haven't really been

05:34.568 --> 05:37.193
spouting them lately in case you
haven't noticed. Ok. I owned up to my shit.

05:37.262 --> 05:39.395

you should do the same.

Whoa. Back off.

06:11.861 --> 06:13.698
We're not going to back off, Tom.
We've been backing off for months, man.

06:13.766 --> 06:14.683
He needs to hear this.

06:14.803 --> 06:16.634
He needs to hear it.

06:17.554 --> 06:22.743
Oh, look who finally took the
pacifier out of his mouth to form words.

Ok.

06:39.368 --> 06:40.260
Jesus. What a joke.

06:40.328 --> 06:43.032
Well, maybe I'll just come
over on the other side of the table

06:43.686 --> 06:45.532
and beat the shit out of ya.
How would that do?

06:45.601 --> 06:47.368
That's the Tommy Gavin we know.
Punch somebody in the face,

06:47.436 --> 06:48.769
it solves everything.

06:51.428 --> 06:54.508
Ok! We got a problem here?

06:54.577 --> 06:55.677
Yeah. Lou.

06:55.745 --> 07:00.515
Ok. You got a problem with Lou,
you talk to me. And I will talk to Lou.

07:00.584 --> 07:03.209
Ok. Since when did this
become the marine corps and shit?

07:03.522 --> 07:05.586
I mean, we're not allowed
to question authority or something?

07:05.655 --> 07:07.555
I mean, aren't we all friends here?
Family?

07:07.623 --> 07:09.141
I mean, you guys ain't doing
nothing about it. So--

07:09.261 --> 07:11.580
Franco, shut your mouth.

07:12.518 --> 07:14.429
You're going to eat your way
right out that door, Lou.

07:14.498 --> 07:16.365
Probably feet first. Real talk.

07:16.434 --> 07:18.563

one of us ends up in a chair.

07:18.683 --> 07:19.554
Hey, whoa!

That is your lieutenant
you are speaking to.

07:22.470 --> 07:24.493
I don't have to explain myself
to you, Franco.

07:24.613 --> 07:29.148
I taught you this goddamn job.
I taught all of you how to stay alive.

07:30.614 --> 07:31.947
I earned my rank.

07:32.015 --> 07:33.529
You gotta keep earning it.

07:51.849 --> 07:55.953
There. Ok, Franco?
You happy now?

07:56.073 --> 07:57.678
It's a start.

08:01.069 --> 08:02.678
Good.

08:02.747 --> 08:04.213
Clean it up, Franco.

08:04.911 --> 08:09.051
Don't take it there, Lou.
I'm your friend. Not your bitch.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.191
Pick it up.

08:13.090 --> 08:16.183
Are you two seriously on board with this?
I mean, really?

08:16.303 --> 08:19.695
Your supposed friend here, you're just
going to back him up in his gluttony?

08:19.764 --> 08:21.463
Chain of command, Franco.

08:21.532 --> 08:24.667
We lose that, what do
you think we got left?

08:24.735 --> 08:26.735
A dirty floor, I guess.

08:26.804 --> 08:30.377
Pick it up, Rivera, now.

08:39.349 --> 08:41.582
Thanks for the backup, guys.
I appreciate that.

08:42.251 --> 08:45.120
I guess I'll got get a broom, sir.

08:45.189 --> 08:46.323
You do that.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.848
- I'm going to get more donuts.
- All right.

09:02.175 --> 09:06.365
Sid. Hey, Sid.

09:08.030 --> 09:09.904
What are you,
just taking in the air out here?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.216
Just thinking of things.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.685
All right, well you better get
inside because we got trouble.

09:14.753 --> 09:16.520
Trouble is all we ever got.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.489
I'm serious.
The junior guys just called out Lou.

09:19.558 --> 09:20.423
For what?

09:20.492 --> 09:23.560
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the fact that he weighs 600 pounds.

09:23.628 --> 09:25.161
I don't give a shit anymore.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.879
Listen, we got a full-scale mutiny going
on in there.

09:29.013 --> 09:31.139
You're just going to stand out here
and count cigarette butts?

09:31.259 --> 09:32.720
Sidney, what the hell is going on with you?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.039
None of your goddamn business
what's going on with me!

09:35.159 --> 09:38.084
Just leave me alone, huh! All of ya!

09:42.816 --> 09:44.240
Hey, chief--

09:54.533 --> 09:56.347
- Hello.
- Hey. How you doing?

09:56.796 --> 09:57.895
Hey.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.509
Listen, I'm leaving work right now.
You need anything?

10:00.629 --> 10:02.369
No, I don't think so.

10:02.860 --> 10:06.875
I just put Wyatt down. He's been fighting
sleep for 2 hours now.

10:07.576 --> 10:09.747
Oh, you know what would be a great idea?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.900
Could you not come home for a
couple hours or so

10:13.020 --> 10:15.502
because if he hears that door and your
footsteps,

10:15.622 --> 10:17.218
he's going to want to get back up again.

10:17.338 --> 10:20.385
And it's going to take me another couple
of hours to get him back down.

10:21.143 --> 10:24.593
Oh, you know what?
I need bananas and yogurt.

10:24.713 --> 10:26.291
So, let me get this straight.

10:26.672 --> 10:30.375
Bananas and yogurt and
stay the hell away?

10:30.495 --> 10:33.333
Honey, I know, I'm sorry.
I'm just so exhausted.

10:33.453 --> 10:35.859
All right. Well, maybe I'll call Colleen.

10:35.979 --> 10:37.362
See if she wants
to go to a meeting or something.

10:37.482 --> 10:39.548
Teddy already took her to a couple today.

10:40.143 --> 10:42.538
And now she's out looking
at wedding dresses.

10:42.658 --> 10:47.017
Just give her a little space, ok?
I mean, aren't you at work?

10:48.102 --> 10:51.513
Don't you have a hose or a
helmet or something you can fix?

10:51.582 --> 10:56.101
Yeah, probably. I don't say this often.
But

10:56.829 --> 11:01.096
I want to tell you how much I love
you and--

11:02.152 --> 11:03.312
Hello?

11:04.938 --> 11:06.329
Hon?

11:07.670 --> 11:09.022
That--

11:10.286 --> 11:12.650
Hey, you guys need
a hand with anything?

11:12.770 --> 11:13.837
What?

11:13.905 --> 11:15.505
I don't know.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.610
No.

11:17.730 --> 11:18.844
You sure?

11:21.246 --> 11:22.979
All right.

11:23.048 --> 11:24.031
Hey.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.283
What, do you need
busy work to do?

11:26.352 --> 11:29.587
Just everybody's--Colleen's
taking care of all the kids.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.589
- Mm-hmm.
- Nobody really needs anything.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.691
The wives too.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.795
You know, nobody talks about
the downside about being a mormon.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.597
Every guy wants 2 chicks
at the same time until they turn on you.

11:39.717 --> 11:41.433
Next thing you know, you're standing
in the kitchen with your dick

11:41.502 --> 11:43.987
in one hand and a
multiple shopping list in the other.

11:44.998 --> 11:46.839
Don't do anything stupid, ok?

11:46.908 --> 11:48.159
I'm not going to do
anything stupid.

11:48.279 --> 11:50.176
I'm talking about this interview
you've got coming up.

11:50.244 --> 11:52.889
All right. Just stick to the story.
Jimmy was a hero.

11:53.009 --> 11:54.733
Jimmy was my cousin.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

11:54.853 --> 11:55.818
- I got it.
- Tommy.

11:55.938 --> 11:58.896
The last thing we need is them
poking around your personal life. Ok?

11:59.016 --> 12:00.731
Ok. Now you sound like my wives.

12:00.851 --> 12:04.508
Uh-huh. I ain't a mormon.
I got another project for you.

12:04.628 --> 12:06.590
- What?
- I need you to talk to Lou.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.713
Get through that thick Irish
head of his, Tommy.

12:08.966 --> 12:11.627
I can't take sides. But what Franco said
has a lot of truth in it.

12:11.747 --> 12:12.897
I know.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.239
Ok. I gotta put you on this, ok?
I'm sorry.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.468
But I've got my hands full with
Feinberg right now.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.310
What's a matter with Feinberg?

12:19.430 --> 12:24.343
I don't know yet.
I think he might be Jewish.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.413
Shalom, tatteleh.

12:27.482 --> 12:28.981
What's tatteleh mean?

12:29.050 --> 12:30.883
Look it up.

12:35.138 --> 12:36.387
Kelly, hey, what's up?

12:36.507 --> 12:37.957
Hey, I need you.

12:38.026 --> 12:39.481
What's going on? You all right?

12:39.601 --> 12:44.272
No I'm not. Not really. Can you meet me?
I need someone to talk to.

12:44.392 --> 12:45.281
Where are ya?

12:45.401 --> 12:49.894
Churrascaria in Tribeca. And can you hurry?
I'm pretty close to the edge.

12:50.014 --> 12:52.553
All right, I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.

12:52.673 --> 12:53.951
Christ.

13:00.131 --> 13:02.356
Listen, you want to tell me
about the composite again?

13:03.106 --> 13:06.274
Right, grain fibers.

13:06.342 --> 13:07.990
Grain fibers?
What, you getting married in a barn?

13:08.110 --> 13:10.012
No. We don't have our
centerpieces yet.

13:10.132 --> 13:11.253
Oh, centerpieces.

13:11.373 --> 13:15.958
Yeah. Right. Uh-huh.

13:16.359 --> 13:20.584
Listen, I'm going to call you back at
this number. Ok. Thank you.

13:20.704 --> 13:24.950
Ohh. Damn. I mean, how much of
this wedding shit a brother

13:25.070 --> 13:27.382
gotta take before he
starts to lose his shit.

13:27.498 --> 13:28.698
It'd be pretty funny though
if you think about it.

13:28.818 --> 13:31.934
No, really. When I lose my shit.
I lose the shit out of my shit.

13:32.003 --> 13:33.702
No. I mean if you got married in a barn.
You could, like,

13:33.770 --> 13:36.237
ride a horse down the aisle.
Train a chicken to be the ring bearer.

13:36.306 --> 13:39.486
And the minister? Dr. Doolittle.

13:40.877 --> 13:43.110
You're going to die a
lonely man, Shawn.

13:43.179 --> 13:45.012
Yeah. Black Shawn's right, dude.
You don't joke

13:45.081 --> 13:47.915
about wedding plans. Because if you do
it right, the day will be really

13:47.984 --> 13:50.984
magical, like full of memories
to last a lifetime. But

13:51.053 --> 13:54.020
if you let the process overwhelm you,
then you'll go crazy.

13:54.089 --> 13:55.955
And everything you built up will
just come crumbling down

13:56.024 --> 13:57.708
around you like in that war movie.

13:57.828 --> 13:59.125
Yeah. "Apocalypse Now"?

13:59.194 --> 14:00.760
"Bride Wars".

14:00.829 --> 14:03.563
Oh, you know, I resent that Mikey,
that you would compare my life

14:03.632 --> 14:06.130
to that low rent, bullshit--

14:06.250 --> 14:07.267
Ohh. Colleen.

14:07.336 --> 14:08.702
Hey, babe, what's up?

14:08.771 --> 14:11.305
Oh, my God.
I just found the perfect dress.

14:11.374 --> 14:12.440
Oh, sweet.

14:12.509 --> 14:15.555
It's a poem by Christos with a
sweetheart neckline and floral applique.

14:15.675 --> 14:16.611
Mm-hmm.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.979
And it's made of ivory satin!

14:18.048 --> 14:18.947
Mm-hmm.

14:19.015 --> 14:20.515
You should come right
now and see it.

14:20.584 --> 14:21.891
You know, I'd love to.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.551
And it's cut on the bias.

14:23.977 --> 14:25.924
So, if you like it, get it.

14:26.044 --> 14:29.491
Great! It's 4,500. I'll see you back
at the apartment, and we'll celebrate.

14:29.559 --> 14:31.917
Oh! On second thought, I'm
coming down to check it out.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.209
Ok. We're on Sulley and Madison.

14:33.329 --> 14:36.633
On my way. And holster that
MasterCard until I get there, all right?

14:36.753 --> 14:38.300
And you're with who?

14:38.369 --> 14:42.804
Shit! 4,500 bucks for a dress?!

14:42.873 --> 14:47.019
That shit better be made out of
crusted diamonds and platinums and shit.

14:47.139 --> 14:49.811
Yo, Garrity, I
need some backup, man.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.678
Dude, so...hot.

14:51.798 --> 14:55.017
I know. And she wears that
tulip bodice like a princess.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.163
I know. What did you just say?

14:56.283 --> 14:57.954
Yo! Dress shop.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.355
I can't wait. Let's do it.

14:59.424 --> 15:00.644
Hey, can I come?

15:00.764 --> 15:02.792
Sure. Just as long as
you don't try shit on.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.427
You know what? I'm just going to
need 10 quick minutes because

15:04.496 --> 15:06.710
I gotta take a shit.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.788
I think he's going to rub--

15:09.908 --> 15:11.706
I know what
the hell he's going to do. Come on.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.181
Just one second.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.449
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:27.518 --> 15:30.486
Tommy, this Ron.
Ron, this is Tommy.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.921
- Hey.
- Hello.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.780
Ok, Ron. You have to go.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.594
Remember, I told you I might
have this thing later tonight

15:37.663 --> 15:39.330
that I wouldn't be
able to get out of.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.831
Yes, you mentioned that.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.363
Well, this is my thing.
He's early.

15:46.206 --> 15:50.296
You know, you're just afraid--afraid of
what I represent to you.

15:50.608 --> 15:53.913
You're pushing me away because I've asked
you to embrace a measured practice

15:53.982 --> 15:57.817
of ease and calm.
And that requires becoming intimate

15:57.885 --> 16:01.688
with your own feelings of trust--
trusting yourself, trusting--

16:01.756 --> 16:04.002
I've been listening to almost
an hour of this shit.

16:05.222 --> 16:10.197
I am pushing you away, Ron, because
you're boring me to tears.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.464
You're a fantastic doctor.

16:11.532 --> 16:14.787
You're a sucky date.
Now, just scoot.

16:15.569 --> 16:20.759
She's--she's the kinda girl when--
It's go time when she makes up her, you know.

16:22.499 --> 16:25.675
I just want to tell you in
all my years of

16:25.744 --> 16:28.230
playing the field, this is the first time
I've ever been replaced

16:28.245 --> 16:29.193
in the middle of a date.

16:29.313 --> 16:33.063
No, no. I'm not replacing you.
Nah. No, it's--

16:33.747 --> 16:37.453
I'm a friend of hers.
More like I'm a pinch-sitter.

16:37.522 --> 16:40.155
You're the baseball player.

16:41.592 --> 16:43.259
No.

16:43.328 --> 16:45.528
Right.

16:45.596 --> 16:49.198
We're still on for my white
blood cell count tomorrow?

16:51.970 --> 16:54.070
So, that's the doc?

16:54.139 --> 16:57.007
Yes, the hot doc I was so
desperate to have ask me out.

16:57.874 --> 17:02.079
Wow.
So, who's the baseball player?

17:02.148 --> 17:04.482
I don't know. Eric somebody.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.934
He said he played for one
of the New York teams.

17:07.054 --> 17:10.289
Eric. Not Derek.

17:10.358 --> 17:12.426
Yeah.

17:13.082 --> 17:15.595
Was his last name Jeter?

17:15.714 --> 17:18.884
Yeah, that's it.
He was visiting some sick kids.

17:18.910 --> 17:20.867
He talked to me for what
seemed like forever.

17:20.935 --> 17:22.501
You talked to Derek Jeter?

17:22.569 --> 17:27.140
I guess. I don't know.
I asked Derek Jeter to stop talking to me.

17:27.208 --> 17:31.511
You asked-- you asked Derek
Jeter to stop talking to you?

17:31.579 --> 17:35.647
It was just championship this,
championship that.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.083
He had a big giant girly ring on.

17:37.152 --> 17:39.229
Baseball, baseball,
blah, blah, blah.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.074
Oh, my God.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.665
It never fails. The cute ones
are just dull as milk.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.926
Speaking of which, is that what
you're drinking these days?

17:45.995 --> 17:47.361
What are you drinking?

17:47.430 --> 17:49.054
Van Gogh vodka.

17:51.834 --> 17:57.771
Really? Does it come with a severed
ear in the bottom of the bottle?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.608
Ah, you're making me laugh.

17:59.676 --> 18:01.476
Yeah. That's my job, right?

18:01.545 --> 18:03.445
- Is this water?
- Yep.

18:04.421 --> 18:07.916
Well, here's to Jeter.

18:07.984 --> 18:09.318
Mm.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.926
So, what was the doc
rambling on about?

18:16.994 --> 18:20.085
Oh, meditation,
tranquility, inner peace.

18:20.205 --> 18:21.097
Oh, my God.

18:21.165 --> 18:24.233
He thinks I'm still very,
very angry and that it's not good

18:24.302 --> 18:25.921
for my immune system.

18:27.111 --> 18:30.006
Well, he's got to admit, you
have a right to be angry given

18:30.074 --> 18:30.940
what's been going on.

18:31.008 --> 18:33.375
Yeah. And he's right.
I am angry.

18:33.443 --> 18:40.215
I think you need forget this
tranquility and peace bullshit.

18:40.284 --> 18:43.819
I think you gotta go with your
strengths, you know?

18:43.887 --> 18:49.910
Embrace the anger and pride.
And don't forget the other like wrath,

18:50.030 --> 18:53.327
resentment, you know, all that stuff.
I mean, you know?

18:53.396 --> 18:56.931
By the way, I'm an expert in all these
particular areas.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.601
So, just so you know. Let's eat.

18:59.670 --> 19:00.735
And drink.

19:00.804 --> 19:04.572
And, uh, brag.

19:04.641 --> 19:05.573
And curse.

19:05.642 --> 19:07.460
Just remember, I can't do the
drinking thing

19:07.580 --> 19:09.601
'cause my sin quotient
just goes through the roof.

19:09.721 --> 19:12.301
When I drink I actually
start inventing sins.

19:18.078 --> 19:20.674
This place is terrifying.
I'm just expecting Maggie to jump

19:20.794 --> 19:22.035
out with a butcher knife.

19:23.176 --> 19:26.686
Well, if it isn't my
2 favorite whores!

19:26.755 --> 19:28.522
No, not you two.

19:28.590 --> 19:30.238
Wow, look at you.

19:30.759 --> 19:31.607
What do you think?

19:31.727 --> 19:34.461
You look expensive.

19:34.530 --> 19:35.296
Mm-hmm.

19:35.364 --> 19:38.833
- But don't you think it's a little...
- Loose in the waist, I know, yeah.

19:38.902 --> 19:43.341
Ah, the problem. I did a little dance.
Got them to take it in free of charge.

19:43.461 --> 19:46.509
Oh, which spa did you pick for
the gift bags?

19:46.577 --> 19:49.412
Wait, don't say it.
Let me guess--Heaven.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.114
No, the Mandarin.

19:51.183 --> 19:54.017
Uhh... it was the Heaven.

19:54.086 --> 19:55.052
I knew it.

19:56.218 --> 20:00.157
Oh, God. Uh, did you hire that chick
photographer I told you about?

20:00.225 --> 20:03.003
Of course I did. I did that.

20:03.123 --> 20:06.729
Because she has some very
reasonable rates. We're fine.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.064
Great. Great.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.934
Um, there's just one
problem though.

20:11.003 --> 20:11.701
What's the, Boo?

20:11.770 --> 20:14.871
There is no spa called Heaven and
the photographer's an old queen.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.006
Is that right?

20:17.075 --> 20:17.873
Hey, Mike.

20:17.942 --> 20:19.953
Hey, hey.

20:20.861 --> 20:22.911
You didn't do any of the shit
I asked you to do, did you?

20:22.980 --> 20:23.979
Come on, Colleen.

20:24.047 --> 20:26.215
I thought this was something
you wanted to do.

20:26.283 --> 20:27.363
It is.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.684
Then why aren't you doing shit?

20:30.720 --> 20:32.653
Maybe because I have nuts.

20:32.722 --> 20:34.265
Not for long.

20:34.385 --> 20:35.456
She's really laying
into him, huh?

20:35.524 --> 20:37.074
Yeah, sucks dude.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.492
What are you doing?
What's all this?

20:38.561 --> 20:40.327
I don't know. I was picking
that chick's brain

20:40.396 --> 20:42.530
over there and I got, like,
inspired I guess.

20:42.599 --> 20:43.730
What chick?

20:43.850 --> 20:46.512
Yowsa. That chick?

20:46.632 --> 20:48.646
Yeah. Emily. She works here.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.806
Oh my God. She looks like the
chick from the bridal magazine

20:50.926 --> 20:54.107
that I was reading
while I was taking a shit.

20:54.227 --> 20:59.572
- Hey, you gonna try and bang her?
- Nah, bro. I'm not in that mode right now.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.510
What are you talking about?

21:00.630 --> 21:03.037
Getting laid mode? I didn't realize
there was a not getting laid mode.

21:03.157 --> 21:04.764
She's single.

21:04.884 --> 21:06.997
How do you know that?
You guys have a little girl chat?

21:07.117 --> 21:09.353
Huh? I'm kidding. Come on.
You're my best gay friend.

21:11.930 --> 21:15.031
Dude.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.861
Why don't you go
talk to her, dude?

21:17.981 --> 21:20.547
Come on. No way.
I haven't crossed the goal line in months.

21:20.667 --> 21:21.638
I wouldn't even know what to say.

21:22.078 --> 21:26.777
Well, since she works in a bridal shop,
right, so she's obviously sensitive.

21:26.846 --> 21:27.578
Ok.

21:27.647 --> 21:30.590
And she's probably creative, right?
And yeah, she's hot, dude.

21:30.710 --> 21:32.657
But that doesn't make her
any different than anybody else.

21:32.777 --> 21:36.387
You just go over and you tell her
that you're marrying off

21:36.456 --> 21:37.488
your friend and take it from there, dude.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.285
Right. That's a good call.
All right. Sensitive. Creative.

21:40.405 --> 21:44.830
Happy. I'm going in.
You got like a mint or something?

21:44.899 --> 21:45.697
No.

21:45.766 --> 21:47.048
All right.

21:49.070 --> 21:50.469
Hi!

21:50.538 --> 21:52.572
How you doing?

21:52.641 --> 21:53.940
Can I help you with something?

21:54.009 --> 21:59.668
Uh, no actually I'm just, you know,
I'm--what do you call it. Looking around.

22:00.084 --> 22:01.198
Browsing?

22:01.318 --> 22:04.016
Yeah. I'm browsing.
That's what I'm doing. I'm browsing.

22:05.788 --> 22:07.591
I just love--I love dress shops.

22:07.711 --> 22:10.830
I'm really--I'm kinda a
sensitive guy, you know.

22:10.872 --> 22:15.842
Creative type. I'm just so happy today
because I'm marrying my friend over there.

22:15.962 --> 22:19.599
That's great. Where are you two going
to be doing it? Connecticut or Vermont?

22:19.668 --> 22:21.267
Uh, no we're going to do
it right here in New York.

22:21.336 --> 22:24.037
Bold. And who will be wearing
the dress, you or him?

22:24.105 --> 22:28.774
Well, it's funny-- oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

22:28.843 --> 22:29.642
That's ok.

22:29.711 --> 22:31.577
That's not how it's
supposed to go.

22:31.645 --> 22:34.579
You know what? If you don't want to
participate, then we can just wing it.

22:34.648 --> 22:35.790
Stop it, Colleen.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.482
No.
We can get married in a barn.

22:37.551 --> 22:40.719
No. No. Would you just stop being ridiculous.
All right, because I came down--

22:40.787 --> 22:44.389
Hey, hey. Why don't we all
just take a nice breath?

22:44.457 --> 22:48.572
I'm going to speak to this young
man for just a minute.

22:49.796 --> 22:52.697
- You better step up, shithead.
- What are you talking about, man?

22:52.766 --> 22:55.316
Just shut up and listen.
This isn't just about the wedding.

22:55.436 --> 22:57.569
All this planning's got her mind
on something productive

22:57.638 --> 23:01.374
and off the booze. She loses focus,
she'll be back on that bottle

23:01.494 --> 23:04.762
quicker than you can say interracial
annulment. Now, get it together!

23:05.074 --> 23:07.412
Hey, Col. Look what I found.

23:09.224 --> 23:11.250
Oh, my God. Is that an a Upsala?

23:11.318 --> 23:15.238
Yes. With a double lace
overlay and spaghetti straps.

23:15.358 --> 23:16.310
Where'd you find it?

23:16.430 --> 23:17.992
It was tucked away behind a Kenneth Pool.

23:18.112 --> 23:20.492
And it's only 750 because it was the
last one in the store.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.771
Oh, my God.

23:22.891 --> 23:24.562
Yeah. And you know I thought
it would go great

23:24.631 --> 23:28.399
with this double tier veil
and these heels.

23:28.468 --> 23:32.069
Oh, my God. Michael, you're like
some kind of wedding savant.

23:32.138 --> 23:33.871
Like a gay Rainman.

23:33.939 --> 23:36.340
Yeah. Instead of counting
cards he counts cocks.

23:36.409 --> 23:40.123
- Hey, Mike. I got her digits.
- Way to go.

23:40.243 --> 23:41.445
Dude, exactly like you said it.
Talk to her like she was a

23:41.514 --> 23:43.376
- real person and it worked.
- What'd you say?

23:43.496 --> 23:46.114
I have no idea. But I'm pretty
sure she thinks we're queer.

23:46.396 --> 23:47.450
She's not alone.

23:47.519 --> 23:49.919
Hey, you know what? Foot's in the door.
That's all that matters boys.

23:51.738 --> 23:53.952
Michael, I love all this stuff.

23:54.072 --> 23:57.734
Yeah, I guess I got like
a knack for it, right?

23:57.854 --> 24:04.671
Yeah. Um, would you maybe want to
help us plan the rest of the wedding?

24:04.954 --> 24:07.203
Uh, yeah. I'd be honored.

24:07.272 --> 24:08.738
That'd be amazing.

24:08.806 --> 24:11.273
Actually, you know, I was
thinking, and

24:11.342 --> 24:14.977
you know, I don't want to tell anybody what
to do or anything, but

24:15.046 --> 24:20.804
maybe we could just, like, take this stuff
and just use it for inspiration.

24:20.924 --> 24:22.952
And we can design your
dress together.

24:23.021 --> 24:23.719
Oh, my God.

24:23.788 --> 24:25.154
Yes, let's do it. Yeah!

24:25.223 --> 24:27.857
Let's do it.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.492
Cool!

24:30.561 --> 24:33.917
Oh, my gosh. And Uncle Teddy,
I've been thinking

24:34.037 --> 24:37.071
and I want you to be the one who
walks me down the aisle.

24:37.829 --> 24:39.212
You serious?

24:39.332 --> 24:40.535
Of course I am.

24:40.655 --> 24:42.494
Don't you think your
dad'll be disappointed?

24:42.806 --> 24:44.773
Don't you think he'll blow it?

24:48.846 --> 24:53.081
Well, some guys watch football.
Others design dresses.

24:53.150 --> 24:55.751
Who are we to judge?

24:55.820 --> 24:59.287
Fag.

25:02.036 --> 25:06.438
Sorry, I came up so short in the
sin department.

25:06.558 --> 25:09.749
One van Gogh vodka and half a steak.
Not very evil.

25:09.869 --> 25:11.504
I thought I had more gas in the tank.

25:11.624 --> 25:13.470
I wouldn't worry about it.
I think we made up for

25:13.539 --> 25:18.142
our lack of gluttony and sloth with our
pure, unadulterated

25:18.211 --> 25:21.490
scorn for the rest of people
in the restaurant. Not to mention the lying.

25:21.610 --> 25:23.847
Hmm?

25:23.916 --> 25:26.283
You kept on saying what a
good time you were having.

25:26.352 --> 25:28.323
I was having fun.
I was having a blast.

25:28.443 --> 25:32.823
Yeah. But there was something underneath it.
You weren't you're usual--

25:38.430 --> 25:39.863
Do you want some water?

25:39.932 --> 25:43.066
Sure.

25:43.135 --> 25:48.898
Um, I'm finished with my treatment.

25:49.018 --> 25:55.685
And they do some scans to find out
if you're free and clear.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.564
And I'm waiting for the results.

25:58.233 --> 26:02.352
If they are not good, I have to start

26:02.619 --> 26:06.247
the chemo all over again, which
would suck ass.

26:08.410 --> 26:11.158
But you know what?
I get to pick out a whole brand new set

26:11.227 --> 26:13.589
of tits, which is kind of exciting.

26:13.842 --> 26:15.239
And I think I'm going to go bigger,

26:15.359 --> 26:16.963
which is weird 'cause I never
really wanted big tits.

26:17.032 --> 26:19.700
And I'm not talking like Pam Anderson--2
midgets just moved

26:19.768 --> 26:23.037
into my chest big. Just a little bit--
just a little bit bigger

26:23.105 --> 26:28.977
than my original ones.
And you know what? It's funny because

26:29.045 --> 26:33.095
I'm completely obsessed with other women's
tits like I can't stop staring at them.

26:33.215 --> 26:35.377
Like everybody--the doctors, the nurses.

26:35.497 --> 26:40.082
People walking down the street keep busting
me, you know, checking out their rack.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.239
And then one time I was in this
plastic surgeon's office

26:43.269 --> 26:45.110
and this chick actually showed me her tits.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.002
Because she thought
his work was really good.

26:47.122 --> 26:49.505
And she wanted me to see,
which she was right.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.795
And so probably I am going to go with him.

26:52.182 --> 26:53.535
Do you believe in God?

26:56.134 --> 27:00.034
Uh... sorry, I'm

27:00.504 --> 27:06.520
still kinda...stuck on the chick
showing you the tits.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.362
Um...

27:08.819 --> 27:12.788
I don't know if I can
answer that question.

27:12.857 --> 27:15.725
Well, it's pretty simple really.
Yes or no.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.361
It's too complicated.

27:19.017 --> 27:21.396
Yeah, I get it.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.987
I mean, when I was a kid, I went
to catholic school.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.717
It was very simple. God is good.
Satan is evil.

27:28.762 --> 27:30.848
You obey the 10 commandments,
you go to heaven.

27:32.186 --> 27:35.672
And then when I was pregnant, I
started to have a little more faith,

27:35.792 --> 27:38.421
you know, just in the
world, in something

27:39.009 --> 27:44.630
you know, bigger than me.
And I even started going back to church.

27:46.519 --> 27:49.658
And I started picturing my daughter walking
down the aisle

27:49.727 --> 27:52.428
in her white dress, making her
first communion.

27:57.002 --> 28:01.272
But you know how that story ends.
So...

28:06.914 --> 28:10.884
But you know when she died I did
talk to the priest.

28:11.241 --> 28:13.300
I asked him, you know,

28:15.614 --> 28:19.806
why she was taken.
And he said,

28:21.369 --> 28:22.975
he said it was a mystery.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.268
Like it was some big
magic show, you know.

28:33.307 --> 28:35.017
But at least I don't have
to worry about

28:35.611 --> 28:40.147
leaving her behind on her own.
I mean, that must bug you, right?

28:40.216 --> 28:42.746
What would happen to your kids.

28:42.866 --> 28:45.987
Don't you think
about death all the time in your job?

28:46.828 --> 28:49.237
No, not really. I mean, you can't....

28:50.605 --> 28:53.287
You can't really think about that.
You run in. You run out.

28:54.804 --> 28:58.464
Run back in.
You kinda have to do it hardcore.

28:58.533 --> 29:02.531
Balls to the wall.
You can't really think about death or

29:03.244 --> 29:06.501
God or any of that shit.

29:07.006 --> 29:12.311
Maybe it's easier then--not
having a belief in some great beyond.

29:12.431 --> 29:15.114
You know, maybe it
all just fades to black.

29:18.819 --> 29:22.387
I actually--I kinda of...

29:22.973 --> 29:26.658
I kinda believe in something.

29:26.727 --> 29:28.777
Like heaven?

29:29.238 --> 29:31.563
No. Not heaven.

29:32.022 --> 29:37.405
Um, obviously I've had a lot of death.

29:37.525 --> 29:42.443
My son and my cousin and
all the guys I knew on 9/11.

29:42.979 --> 29:45.224
Um,

29:45.942 --> 29:48.250
and they--

29:49.821 --> 29:52.463
I-- they--

29:53.449 --> 29:56.972
I've kinda heard from these guys.

29:57.092 --> 29:58.832
How?

30:00.328 --> 30:02.128
Ok.

30:03.644 --> 30:05.277
It's a little hard to explain.

30:05.278 --> 30:08.921
They...kind of appear.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.273
Now, some of this happened
while I was drinking.

30:12.329 --> 30:15.437
But you know, I
definitely--

30:16.284 --> 30:20.369
there's no question that they were,
you know, they were here.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.160
You know, it happened a lot.
And it happened enough that

30:25.280 --> 30:31.823
sometimes there was something
soothing about it.

30:31.943 --> 30:35.466
And I just sort of liked the idea

30:35.586 --> 30:40.562
they were maybe in this--
I don't know--like limbo.

30:41.674 --> 30:48.202
They cancelled limbo and purgatory and
sex with little boys--all the fun stuff.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.876
I gotta smoke some
weed and hit the hay.

30:54.944 --> 30:59.611
Oh.
Ok.

31:01.651 --> 31:05.085
- So, do you feel better?
- Oh, yeah.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.256
After you leave, I'm going to drink
a half a bottle of van Gogh's vodka

31:08.376 --> 31:10.308
and wait for the ghost of my daughter
to show up.

31:10.428 --> 31:12.931
Oh, and if I die first, I
promise to come back and haunt you

31:13.051 --> 31:14.560
if you even start drinking again.

31:15.004 --> 31:19.450
That'd be a great reason to pick up.
Nobody's dying anytime soon.

31:20.699 --> 31:21.916
All right?

31:22.902 --> 31:24.240
All right.

31:26.007 --> 31:27.672
See you later.

31:41.787 --> 31:43.638
Looking for these?

31:43.874 --> 31:45.156
How'd you know?

31:45.276 --> 31:49.597
Ha ha. How'd I know?
First I noticed chocolate frosting

31:49.717 --> 31:51.991
on the pot handles. Then sprinkles.

31:52.060 --> 31:56.068
And then crumbs.
I mean, how could you, Lou.

31:56.188 --> 32:01.250
After what Franco had to say? After it took
5 guys for you to pass your physical.

32:01.370 --> 32:03.234
Stress makes me want cupcakes.

32:04.377 --> 32:06.771
Ok. How about another heart
attack--what would that?

32:06.839 --> 32:08.124
Muffins.

32:08.244 --> 32:09.541
Really?

32:09.610 --> 32:10.876
And death?

32:10.944 --> 32:12.544
Donuts.

32:12.613 --> 32:16.611
Look, my mom bought donuts after
anybody in the family died, all right?

32:16.664 --> 32:18.361
You gotta problem with
that, talk her.

32:18.887 --> 32:23.628
I mean, I gotta--I gotta problem with food.
What do you want me to say?

32:23.748 --> 32:25.563
I want you to say you're
going to go on a diet.

32:25.683 --> 32:27.065
I'll go on a diet.
Now, give me my cupcakes.

32:27.185 --> 32:27.997
No.

32:30.660 --> 32:36.236
Look, I heard what Franco had to say, ok?
And... And...

32:37.098 --> 32:40.105
he was right.
I've been dragging the crew down.

32:40.655 --> 32:44.719
And I feel responsible
for this whole Damien thing. I mean--

32:46.345 --> 32:48.995
It never would have happened
unless I screwed up.

32:49.115 --> 32:52.417
And I screwed up because
I'm so goddamn out of shape.

32:52.812 --> 32:54.903
And I feel like it's my fault.

32:55.792 --> 32:59.492
All right, listen.

33:00.652 --> 33:02.020
You wanna talk about fault.

33:02.140 --> 33:05.270
Faulty floor, faulty table saw, number 1.
Number 2,

33:05.390 --> 33:08.700
you want to point fingers, I mean,
I'm the guy who convinced him

33:08.753 --> 33:10.078
to become a firefighter in the first place.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.323
I talked him back on the rig.

33:13.986 --> 33:20.663
All right, so that's--that's not what
this is about. I'm not blaming you, ok?

33:20.783 --> 33:22.117
- Yeah.
- All right?

33:24.558 --> 33:26.952
- Is that a mouse?
- What?

33:27.289 --> 33:29.089
Jesus, you--

33:35.878 --> 33:37.827
Are you kidding--
Oh, no. I'm not kidding.

33:37.947 --> 33:39.889
Sit down. Sit down!

33:41.926 --> 33:45.104
Unbelievable. Grown man.

33:49.368 --> 33:52.710
I don't even know where to begin with you.
I really don't.

33:52.779 --> 33:56.951
We--could you look at me, please,
when I'm talking to you?

33:58.958 --> 34:03.369
I mean, this is--you really--
Eyes.

34:05.424 --> 34:07.925
I can't. I can't with these
right in front of my face. Come on.

34:07.994 --> 34:11.964
It's like having a plate
of tits on the table.

34:16.108 --> 34:20.346
I think to most normal people,
if you said, ok, me vs. you--

34:20.466 --> 34:24.664
we gotta guy who's got a giant
eating disorder vs. a guy that

34:24.784 --> 34:29.742
takes way too many chances in fires,
which guys is more likely to die first.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.378
Hands down you.

34:32.716 --> 34:35.572
- You're 40 pounds overweight.
- You're a maniac.

34:35.692 --> 34:38.539
You can't walk up 3 flights of
stairs without gasping for breath.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.780
You can sprint up 3 flights
of stairs into a burning room

34:41.900 --> 34:44.460
with no mask on for
the sheer rush of it.

34:47.434 --> 34:51.418
I'm about to ask you to
do what might be the biggest

34:51.538 --> 34:53.838
- favor as my best friend--
- No.

34:53.907 --> 34:55.545
You haven't even heard what I was
going to ask you--

34:55.614 --> 34:56.583
I'm hungry.

34:59.711 --> 35:06.254
I want you to be the
godfather to my new kid.

35:12.053 --> 35:15.429
Yeah. That got your
attention didn't it?

35:17.719 --> 35:24.639
All the other kids are spoken for.
Between Nicky and Teddy and

35:25.407 --> 35:28.679
Maggie and Janet's family.
And I just--

35:28.976 --> 35:31.995
I want to make sure with the new kid
that if I don't

35:32.515 --> 35:34.883
come home from work one night that

35:34.952 --> 35:38.737
he or she has a backup dad.

35:41.288 --> 35:42.612
I don't know what to say.

35:42.732 --> 35:45.063
Just say you'll go on a diet, Lou.

35:45.183 --> 35:47.444
If you want do it for yourself,
do it for me.

35:48.009 --> 35:51.474
Your best friend.
Do it for me. Do it for the kid.

35:52.437 --> 35:54.413
Can I have one last cupcake?

35:56.837 --> 35:58.532
Do we have a deal?

36:08.208 --> 36:10.617
I'm going in to take a nap.

36:11.896 --> 36:15.957
When I wake up, if there's a
cupcake on the table,

36:16.418 --> 36:21.716
I know I have a partner.
If not, I know I don't.

36:21.836 --> 36:25.401
Hyman Roth from "Godfather II"?

36:25.470 --> 36:26.903
Yep.

36:30.417 --> 36:33.709
Jimmy was dedicated.
He was tough, you know. He was a...

36:33.777 --> 36:37.380
He was a firefighter's firefighter, kinda
guy who always had your back.

36:37.633 --> 36:41.535
Like many New York City
firefighters, Jimmy Keefe loved his job

36:41.655 --> 36:43.409
even more because of
where it happened--

36:43.529 --> 36:47.421
in the world's busiest city, in the
biggest department in the fire service,

36:47.490 --> 36:50.137
in one of F.D.N.Y.'s busiest houses.

36:50.257 --> 36:53.028
You know, I thank God that he
ended up in this hisse.

36:53.096 --> 36:58.556
'Cause he was a rock.
He was a real go-to guy.

36:58.676 --> 37:00.332
And a hell of an athlete.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.054
Let me tell you
something, when that bell rang,

37:03.174 --> 37:05.185
he was the first to go.

37:05.958 --> 37:09.434
On 9/11 Jimmy did what he always did.
He ran in hard and fast

37:09.554 --> 37:10.869
fast looking for someone to save.

37:11.211 --> 37:14.750
The only difference that day was,
he didn't come out.

37:14.819 --> 37:17.853
He taught me everything I know
about being a fireman.

37:17.922 --> 37:21.824
He was good about it too.
He never talked down to a new guy.

37:21.893 --> 37:26.649
You can break a kid's spirit that way.
But whatever, he didn't do that.

37:26.769 --> 37:29.565
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Him and Tommy Gavin, when

37:29.634 --> 37:32.434
I first came in the house,
they were tough, you know.

37:32.503 --> 37:35.395
I mean, they hold you accountable
to all your actions in a burn.

37:35.723 --> 37:39.107
But at the same time, they make sure you
know how to do things the right way.

37:39.176 --> 37:42.057
I wouldn't be sitting in
this chair talking to you

37:42.177 --> 37:44.570
right now if it wasn't for Jimmy Keefe,
I'll tell you that.

37:45.165 --> 37:51.161
You know, Jimmy--he saved my life several
times over just by what he taught me.

37:51.474 --> 37:55.638
A dedicated family man, Jimmy
Keefe spent almost every hour

37:55.758 --> 37:58.359
away from the firehouse
with his wife and child.

37:58.479 --> 38:02.931
Every spare minute he had he was at home.
I knew

38:03.051 --> 38:06.670
how much he loved the job.
Every firefighter's wife knows that.

38:07.082 --> 38:11.468
Or at least they should.
He was so present

38:11.915 --> 38:17.686
and involved with the baby
and Damien's schoolwork and

38:18.311 --> 38:20.541
little league, pee-wee hockey.

38:22.014 --> 38:29.201
I just never had to wonder where he was.
He was either with us or at work.

38:29.321 --> 38:32.494
Those are the
only 2 places he ever was.

38:32.563 --> 38:36.669
He loved her. He loved that kid.

38:37.339 --> 38:39.277
He loved the job.

38:41.577 --> 38:42.790
End of story.

38:44.810 --> 38:49.057
So, you can see what we're after here.
This is just a taste, of course.

38:49.177 --> 38:52.914
We're still missing a lot of footage.
And this is just a rough cut.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.751
But this is the fabric of the piece.

38:55.820 --> 38:57.019
Camera's up.

38:57.088 --> 38:59.273
- Whenever you're ready.
- Ok.

39:02.685 --> 39:03.889
Look, don't be nervous.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.617
- I'm not nervous.
- Let me see your hair.

39:05.737 --> 39:06.794
What?

39:06.863 --> 39:09.764
Don't get nervous when the
lights get turned on.

39:09.832 --> 39:10.835
Yeah.

39:10.955 --> 39:11.876
What do you mean?

39:12.311 --> 39:15.225
Well, some people freak out
when the lights get turned on.

39:15.345 --> 39:17.158
They get all jittery.

39:17.278 --> 39:19.507
- What?
- Look, he's the guy.

39:19.575 --> 39:20.284
I'm not.

39:20.404 --> 39:21.869
I don't know about that. I mean,
I got a little

39:21.989 --> 39:23.668
jittery myself when I did my interview.

39:23.788 --> 39:25.773
- You did?
- A little bit. Yeah, I did.

39:25.893 --> 39:26.844
Yeah. I got those jangles.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.015
You got jangles?
What the hell is a jangle?

39:29.135 --> 39:31.250
- It's like a twitch. It goes away.
- Oh, don't get that,

39:31.319 --> 39:32.323
The jitters or the jangles?

39:32.443 --> 39:36.397
- Because--
- All right, I'm going. How do I look?

39:36.517 --> 39:37.623
You look great.

39:37.692 --> 39:38.557
Do this. Do this.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.893
- You're good.
- Don't sweat.

39:46.858 --> 39:48.404
Right here?

40:03.584 --> 40:04.669
You good?

40:04.789 --> 40:05.918
Yep.

40:06.038 --> 40:08.088
Ok.

40:08.157 --> 40:10.223
Rolling.

40:10.292 --> 40:11.828
You and Jimmy Keefe.

40:12.586 --> 40:15.843
You were cousins, best friends,

40:15.963 --> 40:18.732
brothers in the brotherhood.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.845
Yeah.

40:20.965 --> 40:25.605
You went through the academy together.
You got assigned to this house together.

40:26.510 --> 40:33.335
You arrived down at the World Trade Center
together on that fateful morning.

40:34.183 --> 40:37.118
- Yes.
- You went in together.

40:42.508 --> 40:43.325
Yeah.

40:43.445 --> 40:47.064
We all know what happened that day.
How it began.

40:47.956 --> 40:51.647
How it progressed. How it ended.

40:52.464 --> 40:55.033
Jimmy became a hero.

40:55.591 --> 40:59.967
343 men became heroes,

41:01.039 --> 41:04.980
some of whom had their flaws.

41:07.410 --> 41:10.726
What would you change if we could go
back in time,

41:11.514 --> 41:13.774
what would you change that morning?

41:15.797 --> 41:19.271
What would have
been a happy ending that day?

41:28.009 --> 41:29.849
There are no happy endings.
