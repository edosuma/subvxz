00:01.100 --> 00:02.683
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:02.684 --> 00:04.843
She says she forgives you about the
pendant.

00:04.844 --> 00:07.147
I get messages - psychic messages.

00:07.148 --> 00:09.451
You're saying Danny Latimer wants us

00:09.452 --> 00:11.755
to know he was put in a boat before
he died?

00:11.756 --> 00:13.771
I'm not his best friend! I hated him!

00:13.772 --> 00:17.371
If someone deletes something from a
hard drive, is it gone forever?

00:17.372 --> 00:17.712
Tom?

00:20.540 --> 00:23.419
You assaulted a child after you'd
been drinking.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.723
You've no alibi for the night of
Danny's death.

00:25.724 --> 00:27.739
When are we gonna talk about the
baby?

00:27.740 --> 00:28.780
You stay away!

00:29.612 --> 00:31.771
I know about your husband and your
children.

00:31.772 --> 00:33.931
It's Danny's skateboard.
Who gave it to you?

00:33.932 --> 00:37.652
Where's my dog? Bloody answer me!
Where is the dog?

00:37.964 --> 00:40.123
What are we gonna do with you, boy?

00:40.124 --> 00:43.435
There's been a break-in at the hut.
Someone reported torchlight inside.

00:43.436 --> 00:44.476
Stop! Come on.

00:47.612 --> 00:48.242
Get off!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:34.804 --> 01:36.494
What are those?
Grapes.

01:36.820 --> 01:40.707
What did you bring grapes for? I
hoped you might choke on the seeds.

01:40.708 --> 01:41.928
They're seedless.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.996
Don't be a smartarse.

01:45.292 --> 01:48.027
I'm sensing you're angry with me.
You nearly died on me.

01:48.028 --> 01:50.288
No!
No, you did, they told me.

01:51.772 --> 01:53.212
They can't do that.

01:53.644 --> 01:56.235
You discharged yourself
before against their advice

01:56.236 --> 01:58.827
heart arrhythmia. You should've said.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.843
Bloody hell! Is there no privacy
here?

02:00.844 --> 02:02.284
Can't they fix you?

02:03.868 --> 02:06.418
They want to put a pacemaker in me.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.787
They don't know whether I'll survive
the operation.

02:11.788 --> 02:14.168
How long have you been like this?

02:15.244 --> 02:16.454
18 months or so.

02:18.124 --> 02:20.283
It's got worse in the last month or
two.

02:20.284 --> 02:21.904
So you came down here,

02:22.300 --> 02:24.603
you took that case, you took that
job,

02:24.604 --> 02:26.043
knowing you weren't up to it?

02:26.044 --> 02:27.964
We're nearly there, Miller.

02:28.924 --> 02:32.379
That was the killer last night, I'm
sure of it.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.350
Sir, you're unfit for duty.

02:37.276 --> 02:38.896
I have to finish this.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.956
I can't let the family down.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.923
Please, Miller, don't tell the Chief
Super. Please.

02:46.924 --> 02:48.654
I'm going back to work.

02:48.796 --> 02:52.107
Miller, wait. Please don't go,
Miller. Come back, Miller.

02:52.108 --> 02:53.318
That's an order.

02:55.564 --> 02:56.084
Miller!

02:58.876 --> 03:01.611
I hear that shitface is
laid up.

03:01.612 --> 03:03.915
Shitface?
It's what the lads call him.

03:03.916 --> 03:06.075
Shitface? Not much of a nickname.

03:06.076 --> 03:09.243
Well, he does look like shit a lot of
the time, doesn't he?

03:09.244 --> 03:11.259
Is he gonna be all right?
Don't know.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.571
Have you found anything?
We're only just up and running.

03:14.572 --> 03:16.587
Your boys are checking the slope.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.891
So you didn't catch proper sight of
this person?

03:18.892 --> 03:21.483
No, wish I had.
Well, if you go through...

03:21.484 --> 03:25.227
We can start at the back and do a
complete sweep all the way through.

03:25.228 --> 03:27.243
Right.
Have a look in there.

03:27.244 --> 03:29.403
SOCO are back up at the hut after
last night.

03:29.404 --> 03:32.139
Frank, go through our list of people
of interest -

03:32.140 --> 03:35.595
those with no alibis or questionable
alibis on the night of Danny's death.

03:35.596 --> 03:37.755
Find out their movements from last
night.

03:37.756 --> 03:40.059
The likelihood is, the killer was
there.

03:40.060 --> 03:44.091
We were very close. They are rattled
and they will make more mistakes.

03:44.092 --> 03:46.539
Susan Wright is in
custody, we've connected her

03:46.540 --> 03:48.987
to the site where
Danny's body was found.

03:48.988 --> 03:51.003
I'm continuing to question her,

03:51.004 --> 03:54.747
but time is running out before we
have to apply for an extension.

03:54.748 --> 03:57.483
I know this may sound daft, but we
need to find her dog, Vince.

03:57.484 --> 03:58.814
We have a picture.

03:59.212 --> 04:03.531
The dog is a priority. She's very attached
to it and it would help her to talk.

04:03.532 --> 04:05.691
Uniform have turned up nothing so
far.

04:05.692 --> 04:10.011
You probably know the boss was taken
ill last night, during the pursuit.

04:10.012 --> 04:11.595
I don't know when he'll be back.

04:11.596 --> 04:13.755
But we carry on. Do not get
distracted.

04:13.756 --> 04:16.666
Our duty is still to the Latimer
family.

04:24.412 --> 04:27.792
Thanks for everything you've done.
Bye for now.

04:31.036 --> 04:33.195
Don't be ridiculous!
Don't start, Miller.

04:33.196 --> 04:35.067
You can't be here.
Well, I am.

04:35.068 --> 04:37.659
You'll kill yourself!
If that's what it takes.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.251
It's not worth dying for.
Not for you, maybe.

04:40.252 --> 04:42.411
Go away. We can manage without you.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.787
That's what you've wanted
right from the start, this job

04:44.788 --> 04:47.163
the job you think I stole.

04:47.164 --> 04:50.907
For God's sake, sir! Come on,
Miller. With me out you get to lead.

04:50.908 --> 04:53.067
Dream come true.
I wouldn't want your job.

04:53.068 --> 04:57.387
Don't be daft. If you get offered it,
you'd take it. I wouldn't be up to it.

04:57.388 --> 04:59.248
Yeah, you're right.
What?

04:59.404 --> 05:02.571
Well, it's a tough job.
You've found your level.

05:02.572 --> 05:05.019
Rural DS - keep within your limits.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.459
Don't tell me what my limits are!

05:06.460 --> 05:08.710
Then don't tell me to go home.

05:09.484 --> 05:13.083
I can still solve this. Otherwise,
why am I still here?

05:13.084 --> 05:15.404
For God's sake. All right, then.

05:46.492 --> 05:48.592
Right, everyone, back to work.

06:04.492 --> 06:05.882
How are you?
Fine.

06:09.964 --> 06:14.874
I've referred you to the Chief
Medical Officer, first thing tomorrow.

06:15.436 --> 06:17.451
I'm not leaving till this is solved.

06:17.452 --> 06:19.182
You don't get a choice.

06:19.324 --> 06:22.203
As soon as he sees you, you're done,
Alec.

06:22.204 --> 06:26.324
Why did you take this job if you
knew you were this ill?

06:43.516 --> 06:44.556
You all right?

06:45.532 --> 06:47.835
Bring me up to speed with great
economy.

06:47.836 --> 06:48.236
Er...

06:48.988 --> 06:52.299
Susan Wright's alibi for the night
of Danny's death checks out.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.603
The owner of the caravan park saw her

06:54.604 --> 06:56.907
sitting in the window
watching TV with her dog

06:56.908 --> 06:58.758
when he left, about 1:30.

06:59.068 --> 07:01.083
They'd had a birthday
party in the bar which

07:01.084 --> 07:03.099
is why he was so late
leaving that night.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.979
We've had a match at the hut on the
cliff for her DNA and prints,

07:05.980 --> 07:09.291
but the owner has already confirmed
she does clean there.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.307
No matches for any DNA on Danny's
body.

07:11.308 --> 07:13.158
So she didn't kill Danny?

07:13.180 --> 07:15.195
But she knows something, I'm sure of
it.

07:15.196 --> 07:17.787
Don't sit here talking to me, go and
get it out of her!

07:17.788 --> 07:18.298
Go on.

07:37.228 --> 07:39.531
Four cigarettes matching the brand
you smoke

07:39.532 --> 07:42.699
got excavated close to the spot
where Danny's body was found.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.723
There are traces from the skateboard
in your cupboard.

07:45.724 --> 07:47.595
Your prints are on it, as are
Danny's.

07:47.596 --> 07:50.907
You lied to us about Mark Latimer
getting the keys to the hut.

07:50.908 --> 07:53.211
What were you doing on the beach
near...

07:53.212 --> 07:55.227
Where's my dog? Where's Vince?

07:55.228 --> 08:00.028
I understand from your record... You
don't understand anything... love.

08:00.988 --> 08:03.579
Susan, I've been on this case a long
time now.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.595
I have lost so much patience.

08:05.596 --> 08:08.115
If you don't tell me how
you came by the board,

08:08.116 --> 08:10.635
I will have you charged.
You will be in custody.

08:10.636 --> 08:13.371
When I find your dog, I will have
him put down.

08:13.372 --> 08:15.292
Now, tell me what happened.

08:19.996 --> 08:23.016
I was just going out, up from my
caravan.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.288
Up the hill onto the cliff top.

08:28.924 --> 08:30.604
When we got up there...

08:32.956 --> 08:33.816
.. I saw it.

08:34.395 --> 08:35.086
Saw what?

08:36.124 --> 08:36.874
The boy...

08:37.563 --> 08:38.433
lying there.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.578
Anything else?

08:42.604 --> 08:45.804
We walked back down the hill onto the
beach.

08:46.204 --> 08:47.884
And what time was this?

08:49.228 --> 08:50.508
Three, maybe four.

08:50.812 --> 08:53.012
That's when you walk your dog?

08:54.412 --> 08:57.322
It's lovely during the night round
here.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.996
So you walked down onto the beach...

09:01.036 --> 09:02.016
He was all...

09:04.348 --> 09:05.338
.. splayed out.

09:05.788 --> 09:07.998
The skateboard was next to him.

09:08.668 --> 09:09.888
He was beautiful.

09:36.172 --> 09:37.622
You've got children?

09:38.188 --> 09:38.588
Yeah.

09:39.628 --> 09:43.947
If you've got kids, I don't understand
how you could stand over Danny's body,

09:43.948 --> 09:46.251
smoke and then carry on walking your
dog.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.862
I knew he'd be found.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.908
I didn't want to get involved.

09:54.316 --> 09:56.476
You people destroyed my family.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.272
How?

10:02.956 --> 10:04.166
It don't matter.

10:04.396 --> 10:09.286
It does, because it affected how you
were when you saw Danny's body.

10:13.756 --> 10:15.026
We had two girls.

10:17.932 --> 10:20.032
My husband was an electrician.

10:23.548 --> 10:26.715
He used to have sex with the oldest,
but I didn't know.

10:26.716 --> 10:28.731
Then he tried it on with the young
one.

10:28.732 --> 10:31.112
Her sister was having none of it.

10:33.916 --> 10:37.126
She wanted to protect her little baby
sister.

10:38.956 --> 10:40.816
So she got herself killed.

10:41.692 --> 10:44.072
He told me she'd gone travelling.

10:45.148 --> 10:47.408
She'd never said nothing to me.

10:50.188 --> 10:53.468
After a while, people started asking
questions.

10:56.668 --> 11:00.158
Then you lot came, took the young one
into care.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.070
Arrested him.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.438
He told them that I knew...

11:11.068 --> 11:13.328
.. that I was part of it, but...

11:14.380 --> 11:16.580
.. I didn't know. I never knew.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.240
I was pregnant.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.184
Social Services came.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.130
They took the baby.

11:28.492 --> 11:30.862
They said I wasn't a fit mother.

11:34.684 --> 11:37.604
Everything I told the police got
twisted,

11:38.716 --> 11:40.046
thrown back at me.

11:41.884 --> 11:43.104
He was convicted.

11:43.900 --> 11:44.590
Got life.

11:47.068 --> 11:50.098
Hung himself in his cell ten months
later.

11:54.988 --> 11:55.448
Death.

11:59.164 --> 12:01.714
Once it's got its claws into you...

12:02.764 --> 12:04.154
.. it never lets go.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.540
When I was standing on that beach,

12:15.148 --> 12:19.108
looking at that boy's body, I just
kept wondering if...

12:20.044 --> 12:23.894
.. if my girl looked that peaceful
after he killed her.

12:30.988 --> 12:32.658
I don't think she did.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.090
OK, petal.

12:48.356 --> 12:50.556
You are a gem, a precious gem.

12:50.948 --> 12:52.388
No, Mum's the word.

12:53.108 --> 12:53.858
Thank you.

12:58.292 --> 12:59.512
Olly, Olly. Here.

13:01.892 --> 13:03.619
You're looking a bit giddy there.

13:03.620 --> 13:07.075
Yvonne, in the hospital, doing her
welcome carer thing.

13:07.076 --> 13:08.346
Who does she see?

13:09.092 --> 13:09.782
DI Hardy.

13:10.676 --> 13:12.246
Well, you know Yvonne.

13:12.836 --> 13:15.571
She went straight into military
eavesdropping mode.

13:15.572 --> 13:17.602
He was rushed in last night.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.755
Heart problems, serious. Now he's
discharged himself.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.136
He's gone back to work?
Exactly!

13:23.204 --> 13:26.414
Have we got a story brewing here,
sweetheart.

13:29.828 --> 13:32.488
How would you like to put it to him?

13:36.884 --> 13:39.043
You were the last person I expected
to call.

13:39.044 --> 13:41.203
Really? Surely nothing's a surprise
to you?

13:41.204 --> 13:43.651
Very funny. I've never heard that
one before.

13:43.652 --> 13:44.922
What do you want?

13:45.236 --> 13:50.131
The Latimer case. I'll take anything
now, cos I'm running out of time.

13:50.132 --> 13:52.147
So if you have anything for me,

13:52.148 --> 13:53.528
give it to me now.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.846
Thank you. It's about time.

13:57.620 --> 14:02.210
Look, I've been trying to tell you,
I got a message from Danny.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.060
It was someone he knew.

14:05.396 --> 14:07.486
It was someone close to home.

14:08.564 --> 14:10.014
What does that mean?

14:10.580 --> 14:11.990
Close geographically?

14:13.892 --> 14:16.051
Family, friends, what?
I don't know.

14:16.052 --> 14:16.392
I...

14:18.356 --> 14:19.916
Just don't ignore it.

14:21.092 --> 14:24.172
Prove to me that you're not a
bullshitter.

14:24.260 --> 14:28.435
I gave you something, I told you.
You just pretended to ignore it.

14:28.436 --> 14:31.526
I said, "She forgives you for the
pendant. "

14:32.180 --> 14:33.630
What does that mean?

14:34.628 --> 14:36.643
You already know, I can see it.

14:36.644 --> 14:38.659
I haven't got a clue what it means.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.720
All I get are fragments and that's
what I got from you.

14:43.124 --> 14:45.571
That and that you've been here
before.

14:45.572 --> 14:45.972
What?

14:47.012 --> 14:47.762
Just that.

14:51.188 --> 14:51.878
You have.

14:52.628 --> 14:54.787
You have, you've been here before!

14:54.788 --> 14:56.338
I'm right, aren't I?

14:56.804 --> 14:57.254
I am.

14:59.540 --> 15:00.750
How's it feel...

15:01.556 --> 15:04.056
having to eat humble pie like this?

15:12.500 --> 15:13.540
DI Hardy?
No.

15:14.516 --> 15:17.395
But you don't know what I want.
I know the answer's no.

15:17.396 --> 15:19.267
How are you feeling?
What did you say?

15:19.268 --> 15:20.995
You were at the hospital.

15:20.996 --> 15:23.155
I don't know what the hell you're
playing at.

15:23.156 --> 15:27.331
You were rushed to hospital, heart
problems. You discharged yourself.

15:27.332 --> 15:30.352
I don't want to stitch you up,
genuinely.

15:33.668 --> 15:35.107
So what do you want?

15:35.108 --> 15:36.038
An exclusive.

15:38.708 --> 15:41.011
Everybody wants us to see counsellors,

15:41.012 --> 15:43.315
but I don't want to share
what I feel with a stranger.

15:43.316 --> 15:47.746
Don't rule it out. There are some
really great people locally.

15:48.068 --> 15:50.083
I know it doesn't seem like it
but...

15:50.084 --> 15:51.364
talking will help.

15:53.540 --> 15:54.820
We thought that...

15:55.124 --> 15:58.334
Well, Beth suggested and I agreed,
that er...

15:59.588 --> 16:01.315
.. maybe you could counsel us.

16:01.316 --> 16:02.756
That's why we came.

16:03.332 --> 16:03.792
Right.

16:04.916 --> 16:07.363
You know us, you know what
it's been like.

16:07.364 --> 16:08.574
And you're kind.

16:10.820 --> 16:14.707
We just thought you could help, you know?
But not from a religious point of view.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.587
You can mention God. We don't want
banging over the head with it.

16:17.588 --> 16:19.628
No, I understand. No banging.

16:21.908 --> 16:22.428
Well...

16:23.204 --> 16:25.354
listen, I'd be honoured but...

16:25.796 --> 16:26.426
why now?

16:27.524 --> 16:28.214
The baby.

16:28.964 --> 16:30.694
We're due for the scan.

16:31.844 --> 16:33.715
But I don't know if I want to see
it.

16:33.716 --> 16:35.875
I want to want it but I don't.
Don't say that.

16:35.876 --> 16:38.755
It's all right, Mark.
My heart is still full of Danny.

16:38.756 --> 16:41.347
There isn't room for another baby.
There will be.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.363
Stop telling me how I'm going to
feel!

16:43.364 --> 16:46.531
Because you have no idea and no
ability to understand.

16:46.532 --> 16:48.835
Shutting this out is not an option
for me.

16:48.836 --> 16:52.196
I can't do that boxing thing off
that you do.

16:53.156 --> 16:55.027
I have to carry another life in me.

16:55.028 --> 16:56.478
For six more months.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.363
Feeding off me, breathing from me,
sharing my blood.

17:01.364 --> 17:04.531
While you're still grieving.
Yes. And I can't let Danny go.

17:04.531 --> 17:06.632
Nobody's telling you... Sorry.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.155
It's difficult, isn't it? Sorry.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.316
You should talk.

17:14.036 --> 17:15.016
All I want...

17:17.204 --> 17:19.414
.. is to swap places with Danny.

17:19.796 --> 17:22.056
Let me be taken instead of him.

17:23.828 --> 17:27.714
In the night, I lie there and I think,
"What would I go through to have him back?"

17:27.715 --> 17:32.611
I'd be raped, I'd be tortured, I'd have
a gang of men on me, I'd be left for dead,

17:32.612 --> 17:34.402
if it meant he was safe.

17:37.508 --> 17:39.248
Are you all right, Mark?

17:39.524 --> 17:40.044
Yeah...

17:42.980 --> 17:44.995
We just need some answers, don't we?

17:44.996 --> 17:45.746
Some help.

17:48.020 --> 17:52.070
You have a line to the big man.
Why don't you ask him?

17:53.492 --> 17:55.292
We're drowning down here.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.267
We just want it done, don't we?

18:01.268 --> 18:01.958
I mean...

18:05.732 --> 18:07.932
When we met, she was 15, Beth.

18:10.052 --> 18:10.802
She was...

18:12.068 --> 18:13.118
just beautiful.

18:14.948 --> 18:17.148
She was so sunny all the time.

18:20.276 --> 18:24.806
And now this life with me, it's just
destroyed her, hasn't it?

18:25.604 --> 18:26.874
That girl's gone.

18:29.348 --> 18:34.387
So I just keeping thinking how your
life would be if you'd never met me.

18:34.388 --> 18:35.768
This isn't on you.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.000
Can I make a suggestion?

18:41.012 --> 18:42.572
New life is... a gift.

18:44.612 --> 18:47.203
And maybe you can take in this gift,

18:47.204 --> 18:49.454
even if you don't want it yet.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.446
Go for the scan, see how you feel.

18:56.132 --> 18:58.147
Because God has sent you this life.

18:58.148 --> 18:59.948
You may not agree, but...

19:01.604 --> 19:02.824
.. perhaps he's...

19:05.924 --> 19:08.134
.. sent you not what you want...

19:09.524 --> 19:10.974
.. but what you need.

19:57.476 --> 20:00.499
What I'm struggling with is,
I know those cliffs.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.235
If you're walking your dog, you
can't see straight down.

20:03.236 --> 20:07.123
You'd have to be right on the edge to
see Danny's body lying on the beach.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.147
The angle's wrong. So what you're
saying doesn't ring true.

20:10.148 --> 20:13.458
If you don't believe me, that's your
problem.

20:13.604 --> 20:16.854
I think you saw more than you're
telling us.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.476
So have a good think.

20:18.644 --> 20:21.955
Or I will charge you for obstructing
a murder inquiry.

20:21.956 --> 20:23.576
I didn't see anything.

20:23.828 --> 20:27.368
Like you didn't see what your
husband was up to?

20:29.156 --> 20:34.916
You were out walking when Danny's body
was laid on the beach. What did you see?

20:38.948 --> 20:39.518
A boat.

20:43.268 --> 20:44.998
I wasn't on the cliffs.

20:47.444 --> 20:48.884
I was on the beach.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.070
I saw a boat come in.

20:53.636 --> 20:54.966
What sort of boat?

20:56.372 --> 20:58.352
Little... like a rowing boat.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.570
But it had a motor on the back.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.155
I saw it come into shore.

21:05.156 --> 21:07.315
How many people on board?

21:07.316 --> 21:08.611
One.
Are you sure?

21:08.612 --> 21:09.192
Certain.

21:09.764 --> 21:11.144
I saw him get off.

21:11.636 --> 21:13.363
Him? Are you sure it was a man?

21:13.364 --> 21:13.764
Yeah.

21:15.956 --> 21:17.986
And what did that person do?

21:22.580 --> 21:25.080
He carried the body off the boat...

21:26.756 --> 21:28.726
.. and laid it on the beach.

21:32.804 --> 21:35.683
Then he got back on the boat and went
off.

21:35.684 --> 21:37.264
Which direction?
West.

21:38.708 --> 21:43.658
And did you recognise the person
that laid Danny's body on the beach?

21:49.076 --> 21:49.536
Susan?

21:55.556 --> 21:55.956
Yeah.

21:56.996 --> 21:57.916
Yeah, I did.

22:08.228 --> 22:10.148
Mum, please go back inside.

22:10.964 --> 22:13.754
Ellie, can you take my mum in,
please?

22:49.844 --> 22:50.244
Mark?

22:51.140 --> 22:52.410
Yeah.
It's Nige.

22:52.724 --> 22:53.884
All right, mate.

22:54.452 --> 22:56.467
I want you to hear this from me.

22:56.468 --> 22:58.498
The police have taken me in.

22:59.348 --> 23:02.083
And you're my phone call.
Taken you in for what?

23:02.084 --> 23:05.284
They think I had something to do with
Danny.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.734
It's all wrong, this. You know that.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.734
Hey. Hey, I'll see you
when you're done.

23:14.468 --> 23:17.268
Don't worry about anything. You
just...

23:17.348 --> 23:21.018
You tell them the truth and stay
strong. All right?

23:21.524 --> 23:23.314
All right. I have to go.

23:26.852 --> 23:28.582
I have to talk to them.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.150
Right, you take Susan.
I'll take Nigel.

23:50.188 --> 23:52.158
Find out how she knows him,

23:52.204 --> 23:53.834
what the connection is.

23:54.796 --> 23:57.675
I'll see where he says he was that
night.

23:57.676 --> 23:59.115
And why the hell he had her dog.

23:59.116 --> 24:03.206
Are you all right to question him?
Feeling OK? Spectacular.

24:03.580 --> 24:07.323
Run me through where you were the
night Danny Latimer was killed.

24:07.324 --> 24:10.347
We went through all this weeks ago,
when you had Mark in.

24:10.348 --> 24:13.083
I was at home with my mum and we was
watching telly.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.184
What were you watching?
Um...

24:15.244 --> 24:16.694
A show about baking.

24:17.548 --> 24:18.648
Mum loves that.

24:21.292 --> 24:23.442
Do you know this woman, Nigel?

24:25.036 --> 24:26.186
Don't think so.

24:27.916 --> 24:29.236
Do you own a dog?

24:30.508 --> 24:33.838
Not really.
Not really? What, sometimes you do?

24:34.108 --> 24:36.411
The dog comes around part-time?
No.

24:36.412 --> 24:37.862
This amusing to you?

24:39.724 --> 24:43.755
I don't own a dog. Why was there a
dog in your back garden?

24:43.756 --> 24:45.915
Someone asked me to look after it
for 'em.

24:45.916 --> 24:47.486
The owner? This woman?

24:48.508 --> 24:51.648
Susan Wright? Who you said you didn't
know.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.359
So if you're gonna lie, you have to be
consistent.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.671
Cos then there's the issue of your
alibi for the night of Danny's death.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.119
The one you told us about when we
were interviewing Mark.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.711
It was good enough for then, but not
now?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.591
Your mum already told us you weren't
in all that night.

25:07.592 --> 25:12.199
You went out at half-ten for last orders,
she said, when we had Matt Latimer here.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.000
So where were you, Nigel?

25:14.936 --> 25:18.679
You must know Nigel pretty well to
recognise him at night from that distance.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.551
When did you last see Nigel?

25:20.552 --> 25:22.172
A couple of weeks ago.

25:23.288 --> 25:26.368
He came to the caravan. He had a
crossbow.

25:27.608 --> 25:30.919
Threatened to kill me.
OK. Why did he do that?

25:30.920 --> 25:34.160
You'll have to ask him.
No, I'm asking you.

25:34.808 --> 25:37.687
He didn't like what I was saying.
What were you saying?

25:37.688 --> 25:38.788
Don't remember.

25:39.992 --> 25:44.023
Don't remember what you said to make
a man threaten you with a crossbow?

25:44.024 --> 25:47.191
No, not really.
It happens a lot to you, does it?

25:47.192 --> 25:48.052
Off and on.

25:49.496 --> 25:51.466
It ain't always a crossbow.

25:52.232 --> 25:54.967
So Nigel threatens you for some
unknown reason

25:54.968 --> 25:57.288
and you frame him as the killer?

25:58.424 --> 26:00.574
It was him carrying that body.

26:02.168 --> 26:06.343
How do you know Susan Wright?
I don't want to talk about her.

26:06.344 --> 26:10.087
You should have her arrested, have
her in for harassment.

26:10.088 --> 26:13.255
I told her to leave me alone but she
wouldn't.

26:13.256 --> 26:15.586
When did she start harassing you?

26:15.992 --> 26:19.159
The moment she got here. Like... four
or five months back.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.370
What's she harassing you about?

26:26.504 --> 26:30.535
Susan Wright told us she believes you
killed Danny Latimer.

26:30.536 --> 26:33.991
She said she saw you on the beach
with a boat, dragging Danny's body.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.583
She's lying. Did you drag Danny's
body onto the beach?

26:36.584 --> 26:40.183
Did you kill Danny? No, he's my best
mate's boy. Why would I?

26:40.184 --> 26:43.063
Then why is Susan Wright saying
otherwise?

26:43.064 --> 26:45.614
What's she got to harass you about?

26:53.864 --> 26:55.534
She says she's my mum.

26:57.176 --> 27:01.495
Her son? And she's accusing him of
murder? What's going on between them two?

27:01.496 --> 27:03.056
You'd better ask her.

27:07.832 --> 27:10.567
They took him away from me
when everything happened.

27:10.568 --> 27:11.258
25 years.

27:15.752 --> 27:17.262
Then the law changed.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.730
You could request contact.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.554
Took me 18 months to track him down.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.870
I didn't know I was adopted until
she came.

27:28.424 --> 27:32.599
He reacted badly. Didn't want
nothing to do with me.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.903
He threatened me with a crossbow.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.775
I know, and that was stupid,

27:36.776 --> 27:39.986
but with everything that was going
on, she...

27:40.232 --> 27:41.912
she didn't belong here.

27:42.968 --> 27:44.551
There's enough to deal with.

27:44.552 --> 27:48.151
Does he know about your family,
about what happened?

27:48.152 --> 27:49.592
You don't tell him.

27:49.736 --> 27:53.623
I'm having trouble with, if you're his
mum and you want to be reconciled with him,

27:53.624 --> 27:56.071
why did you tell us he was on the
beach that night?

27:56.072 --> 27:59.671
I'm a mum, and whatever my child had
done, I would want to protect them.

27:59.672 --> 28:01.122
I am protecting him.

28:03.704 --> 28:05.904
I told you because I'm scared.

28:07.736 --> 28:08.366
For him.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.730
Because it's not his fault.

28:14.936 --> 28:18.526
If he's his father's son, what is he
capable of?

28:20.120 --> 28:21.860
What might he have done?

28:22.280 --> 28:24.300
I can't just let it happen.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.054
Not again.

28:26.888 --> 28:31.428
Nigel, you need to tell us where you
were the night Danny died.

28:34.808 --> 28:35.618
At night...

28:37.256 --> 28:40.156
I went out, just for a couple of
hours.

28:40.712 --> 28:43.322
I went to the estate. Past Oak Farm.

28:45.608 --> 28:48.919
They've been laying down pheasant,
so I just went and got a couple.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.220
I mean, he's got dozens. He don't
even know.

28:54.104 --> 28:55.974
You were nicking pheasants?

28:57.704 --> 28:58.104
Yeah.

29:00.584 --> 29:03.724
The butcher in town takes 'em off my
hands.

29:04.472 --> 29:09.182
It's not like... like I'm gonna make
me fortune working with Mark.

29:11.528 --> 29:14.018
But... I forgot to fill up the van.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.470
So um...

29:17.864 --> 29:20.894
I siphoned some diesel out of his
tractor.

29:23.048 --> 29:28.519
And then I cut through the barbed-wire
fence to make it look like a break-in.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.960
But I was nowhere near that beach.

29:32.264 --> 29:34.855
Whatever she thought she saw, she
didn't.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.676
So she's lying?
Mate, I don't even know who she is.

29:40.184 --> 29:42.614
Do you want to know... who she is?

29:46.952 --> 29:50.932
Because... in here there are newspaper
articles about her.

29:53.576 --> 29:54.856
About her husband.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.060
It's your family, Nigel.

30:04.808 --> 30:06.498
Interview paused 3:02pm.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.279
You did what?
He wanted to know.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.871
I promised her.
What did you do that for?

30:51.872 --> 30:54.463
I was gaining her trust.
I was gaining his.

30:54.464 --> 30:58.495
We have to cut through what's
connected to Danny and what isn't.

30:58.496 --> 31:00.511
You're the only one running out of
time.

31:00.512 --> 31:04.111
These are people's lives your
trampling on. I should make a complaint.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.559
Go ahead. Add it to the list. I'll
sign it for you.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.151
He's a suspect. He was seen with the
body.

31:09.152 --> 31:12.895
The information I gave him has bearing
on the witness who is accusing him.

31:12.896 --> 31:16.783
You should have let her tell him. I don't
believe Nigel was capable of killing Danny.

31:16.784 --> 31:20.095
Everyone we have interviewed is
capable in the right circumstances.

31:20.096 --> 31:23.407
That's your view of the world. I
don't know how you sleep.

31:23.408 --> 31:24.678
Who says I sleep?

31:25.568 --> 31:26.958
Have you seen this?

31:28.448 --> 31:30.463
I got them to trace the
number of the call that

31:30.464 --> 31:32.479
phoned in to tell us the
light was on in the hut.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.030
It's Danny's mobile. It's the missing
smartphone.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.967
Oh, my God. The killer phoned in.
Why would he do that?

31:39.968 --> 31:43.999
Why tell us where they were and then
run? That don't make sense.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.440
Oh, for God's sake.

31:46.736 --> 31:51.926
As if working with you wasn't annoying
enough, what are they playing at?

31:52.208 --> 31:55.648
All right. Get Nigel and Susan
released on bail.

31:56.672 --> 31:59.839
Have them lodge their passports here
and report in every day.

31:59.840 --> 32:03.871
You're gonna let them both out together?
I'll cobble together some surveillance.

32:03.872 --> 32:06.463
Use some of those numpties they
drafted in.

32:06.464 --> 32:09.919
Maybe Nigel and Susan are both lying.
Let's see what happens.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.231
Light the blue touchpaper and then
retire? We're running out of time.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.622
Well, you might be.

32:20.000 --> 32:20.460
Hello.

32:23.312 --> 32:23.712
Yeah.

32:26.048 --> 32:28.368
I'll be right over.
Over where?

32:30.368 --> 32:31.178
You... Ugh!

32:52.400 --> 32:54.370
I've got something for you.

32:54.848 --> 32:59.167
This is Tom Miller's laptop. I caught
him smashing it up in the woods.

32:59.168 --> 33:00.607
You just stumbled across him?

33:00.608 --> 33:03.055
I was out walking. It's the route I
take.

33:03.056 --> 33:06.511
Do you know what he was trying to get
rid of? I've no idea.

33:06.512 --> 33:09.247
Why did he do that, just after his
best mate's died?

33:09.248 --> 33:12.127
Were they best friends? I didn't see
much evidence of it.

33:12.128 --> 33:14.575
I had to break up a fight between
them.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.879
When was this?
A couple of months ago.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.560
They were having a row.

33:18.608 --> 33:21.055
Tom was really, really laying into
Danny.

33:21.056 --> 33:22.966
And he's that much bigger.

33:24.224 --> 33:28.255
I reported it to both sets of parents.
I thought Ellie would have told you.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.166
No. She didn't mention it.

33:30.992 --> 33:35.062
Look, I should tell you that Tom
knows that I have this.

33:35.456 --> 33:40.286
He threatened to tell you that I
abused Danny, if I handed it over.

33:41.792 --> 33:42.772
He said that?

33:45.680 --> 33:46.720
And did you...

33:48.272 --> 33:49.262
.. abuse Danny?

33:50.288 --> 33:50.568
No.

33:57.632 --> 34:02.352
What were you talking to Tom Miller
about at Jack Marshall's wake?

34:04.112 --> 34:06.542
I was just making sure he was OK.

34:11.456 --> 34:11.976
Thanks.

34:16.928 --> 34:20.527
You need to report in to us every
evening at 6pm.

34:21.248 --> 34:24.208
Why do you keep looking at me like
that?

34:24.272 --> 34:28.112
Back then, in your own house, how
could you not know?

34:34.928 --> 34:37.663
I need a wee favour on the quiet.
Things are complicated.

34:37.664 --> 34:40.684
Can you get stuff off Danny's hard
drive?

34:41.120 --> 34:46.303
Oh, great. I owe you one. Will you send
whatever you find to my personal email?

34:46.304 --> 34:47.864
Great. You're a star.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.410
All right. Can you just take us
through what happened last night?

35:17.552 --> 35:19.352
I was pursuing a suspect.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.591
There was an incident and I was
injured.

35:22.592 --> 35:24.392
Can you name the suspect?

35:24.752 --> 35:28.172
No. And I'm asking you don't publish
this yet.

35:28.928 --> 35:30.778
Give me a couple of days.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.550
All right.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.831
Olly just has a couple of questions
first.

35:34.832 --> 35:35.752
Oh, does he?

35:37.856 --> 35:40.735
The Sandbrook case fell apart at the
trial.

35:40.736 --> 35:42.476
Tell me what went wrong.

35:42.896 --> 35:45.343
Are you serious?
He's more than serious.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.444
He's myprotege.

35:47.504 --> 35:50.959
We've seen you here. We know you're
doing your best for the family, the town.

35:50.960 --> 35:55.279
I don't think it was any different on
Sandbrook. So tell me what happened.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.300
How did it all go so wrong?

35:58.448 --> 36:00.938
You can't keep it secret for ever.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.030
Maybe you're right.

36:09.104 --> 36:10.374
Maybe it is time.

36:35.600 --> 36:40.390
We had our prime suspect but all of
the evidence was circumstantial.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.160
Um... but then during a...

36:44.528 --> 36:47.368
search of a car that he'd just
sold...

36:49.712 --> 36:52.262
.. one of my DS's found a pendant...

36:53.168 --> 36:55.438
.. belonging to one of the girls.

36:56.192 --> 36:59.503
There were clearly prints on it. It
was the smoking gun.

36:59.504 --> 37:03.114
My DS was taking the bagged evidence
back to HQ...

37:09.296 --> 37:10.286
.. and... she...

37:14.480 --> 37:16.495
.. stopped at a hotel for a drink

37:16.496 --> 37:18.526
and her car was broken into.

37:22.256 --> 37:26.156
The car radio and valuables in her
bag were all taken.

37:26.864 --> 37:29.311
Just a quick smash and grab. Local
kids, probably.

37:29.312 --> 37:30.472
And the pendant?

37:33.056 --> 37:37.663
Yeah. We couldn't make the case after
that, so he's still out there.

37:37.664 --> 37:40.154
Why did she stop off at the hotel?

37:50.192 --> 37:54.892
She was having an affair with one of
the other DS's on the team.

37:56.096 --> 37:58.076
She thought she'd celebrate.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.559
But this was all reported at the
time.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.360
The Herald got the story.

38:03.296 --> 38:05.846
But they said it was you, your car.

38:07.616 --> 38:10.351
You took the blame.
It happened on my watch.

38:10.352 --> 38:11.572
She deceived you?

38:13.808 --> 38:15.568
This detective sergeant...

38:19.856 --> 38:21.186
.. she was my wife.

38:23.024 --> 38:28.144
We have a daughter and I didn't want
her knowing that about her mother.

38:28.352 --> 38:29.935
So...
You took the blame.

38:29.936 --> 38:34.296
You took all that flak for years.
The family think it's you.

38:35.696 --> 38:39.439
But you didn't do it. This is what
made you ill, isn't it?

38:39.440 --> 38:41.743
People need to know about this?
Do they?

38:41.744 --> 38:42.614
Really? Why?

38:51.536 --> 38:55.606
Just do me a favour and tell the
family first, will you?

38:57.872 --> 39:03.632
Just tell them I haven't given up on
Sandbrook and that the case is still open.

39:07.232 --> 39:09.103
And then do whatever you like with
it.

39:09.104 --> 39:13.244
Call your friend Karen. This is what
she's always wanting.

39:15.872 --> 39:19.012
One one condition. You do not name
that DS.

39:30.416 --> 39:30.876
Right.

39:32.144 --> 39:33.294
Well, I'm done.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.159
How did you get in here?

40:10.160 --> 40:12.530
If you don't go within the hour,

40:13.616 --> 40:16.346
I will gut this dog whilst you
sleep.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.674
If I go... I'm not coming back.

40:31.328 --> 40:33.708
We'll never see each other again.

40:35.648 --> 40:36.738
I can do that.

40:38.816 --> 40:40.956
I've done it plenty of times.

40:47.168 --> 40:51.188
You contact the police and tell them
you made a mistake.

40:53.072 --> 40:54.682
It wasn't me you saw.

40:56.384 --> 40:57.594
And then you go.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.456
You're the spit of him, Nigel.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.662
You've got him in you.

41:05.888 --> 41:07.498
And it was you I saw.

41:17.696 --> 41:19.999
That was great, Mrs Latimer. Thank
you.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.150
Dean, love, just call me Beth.

41:22.592 --> 41:25.471
"Mrs Latimer" makes me feel like
Mark's mum.

41:25.472 --> 41:27.322
And none of us want that.

41:28.064 --> 41:30.094
Oh, er, I got you something.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.590
For me?
For all of you.

41:34.544 --> 41:37.135
Oh.
For the family. For letting me in.

41:37.136 --> 41:38.526
And for the future.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.198
But mainly for the new baby.

41:44.048 --> 41:46.538
It's the first one, for the new...

41:52.832 --> 41:55.423
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

41:55.424 --> 41:57.854
Oh, don't worry, mate. It's er...

41:58.016 --> 42:01.446
It's all a bit muddled in with
everything else.

42:02.336 --> 42:04.066
He was a good lad, Dan.

42:07.088 --> 42:10.831
Heard anything about Nige? No. I
asked Pete but he's heard no news.

42:10.832 --> 42:14.431
It's not Nige, Dad. Don't go
thinking that. It won't be.

42:14.432 --> 42:16.802
Chloe's right. It can't be Nige.

42:17.456 --> 42:21.806
Him and Dan really got on. I saw it
every time we went out.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.390
What do you mean "went out"?

42:26.672 --> 42:31.279
Catching animals. They'd come up to the
farm and then we'd go out from there.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.270
Late evenings.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.600
Danny said it was OK.

42:40.496 --> 42:41.886
Nige said you knew.

42:43.232 --> 42:44.962
No. No, we didn't know.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.040
Miller? Forensics from the hut.

42:55.904 --> 43:00.504
Boot print in the mud up the hill
matches one they found inside.

43:00.656 --> 43:04.766
It's a man's size ten. What's Nigel
Carter's shoe size?

43:09.872 --> 43:10.212
Ten.

43:12.032 --> 43:14.479
So, what? You think Susan did see
Nige?

43:14.480 --> 43:16.580
Are we missing something here?

43:17.936 --> 43:22.111
What if another person was involved?
Is this something for the morning?

43:22.112 --> 43:25.567
Oh, by the way. Your boy and Danny.
Did they fall out?

43:25.568 --> 43:28.591
No. Paul Coates, the vicar,
said there was a fight.

43:28.592 --> 43:31.432
He mentioned it to you.
No, he didn't.

43:31.616 --> 43:34.495
Are you saying I've been covering
for my son? No.

43:34.496 --> 43:36.943
You do that when you're on the back
foot. You lash out.

43:36.944 --> 43:39.823
When did Danny last come up your
house? It's 2 a. m. I don't know.

43:39.824 --> 43:41.804
Last month? Last two months?

43:41.840 --> 43:42.820
A bit longer.

43:44.432 --> 43:46.992
Can we borrow Tom's computer?
Fine.

43:48.032 --> 43:48.842
Good night.

44:22.736 --> 44:25.766
What are you doing?
Where is his computer?

44:26.336 --> 44:28.766
El, it's half two in the morning.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.807
I'm sorry. Right? I don't know where
it is.

44:49.808 --> 44:52.543
If we go through his room now, we'll
wake him. Do it tomorrow.

44:52.544 --> 44:55.279
That's your answer for everything -
do it tomorrow.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.015
What? What have I done?
Yeah, what have you done?

44:58.016 --> 45:00.895
You can't even finish painting this
room. Six bloody months.

45:00.896 --> 45:03.266
For God's sake. Go to sleep, El.

45:19.760 --> 45:20.510
Of course.

45:21.776 --> 45:22.176
Shit.

45:23.305 --> 45:29.553
