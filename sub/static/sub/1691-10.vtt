00:16.700 --> 00:18.836
Oh, Jesus.

00:18.870 --> 00:20.337
It can't be done.

00:20.371 --> 00:23.007
You sure about that?

00:23.042 --> 00:25.144
Ah. There's a trick, huh?

00:25.178 --> 00:26.345
There's got to be.

00:26.379 --> 00:27.679
This guy wouldn't be
putting any money on it

00:27.713 --> 00:29.015
unless there's a trick, huh?

00:29.049 --> 00:32.186
I'm telling you... it can't be done.

00:32.220 --> 00:33.954
So you give up?

00:33.989 --> 00:38.962
Yeah, all right.

00:48.509 --> 00:49.977
Wait. What?

00:50.011 --> 00:51.179
No way!

00:51.214 --> 00:53.016
Show me that again.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.851
Sure. You got another $20?

00:56.354 --> 00:58.826
Screw this.

00:58.860 --> 01:02.198
Ah, don't go away mad.

01:02.232 --> 01:04.200
Oh, hey, guys, you want to buy a Rolex?

01:04.331 --> 01:05.498
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.967
How much for that cheap piece of crap?

01:07.431 --> 01:09.164
- Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey, Merna.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.662
Holy crap.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.665
Jimmy, my man, I said you
would beat the rap.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.834
Hey, Merna, set him up, would you?

01:14.868 --> 01:15.835
Merna, no, thanks. I'm good.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.002
No, go on. He don't mean it.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.302
You just got out of jail. Come on.

01:18.336 --> 01:19.799
You're... you're not gonna have a drink?

01:19.833 --> 01:20.833
That'll be the day, huh?

01:20.867 --> 01:22.601
Marco, settle down, okay? I'm in a rush.

01:22.635 --> 01:24.769
My brother's outside in a taxi.
The meter's running.

01:24.803 --> 01:26.002
What... Chuck's outside?

01:26.036 --> 01:27.969
Tell him to pull
that broomstick out of his ass

01:28.003 --> 01:29.304
and get in here. I'm buying.

01:29.338 --> 01:31.806
No. No, no, we got no time.
We're catching a plane.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.307
I came here to say goodbye.

01:34.341 --> 01:36.811
I'm moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

01:36.845 --> 01:38.613
Mexico? You skipped bail?

01:38.648 --> 01:39.947
New Mexico...

01:39.982 --> 01:42.280
You know, like, uh, Bugs Bunny
and the Road Runner, you know?

01:42.881 --> 01:44.148
Yeah. What are you gonna do there?

01:44.180 --> 01:46.650
I'm gonna work at his law firm,
like, in the mailroom.

01:46.684 --> 01:47.887
It's a start, anyways.

01:47.921 --> 01:50.059
What? N-now you're talking crazy, man.

01:50.093 --> 01:52.558
You just got out of jail.
Now you want to go back?

01:52.593 --> 01:55.026
Because working for him...
That's all that is.

01:55.061 --> 01:57.364
Marco... I was done.

01:57.398 --> 01:59.501
You understand? I didn't beat the rap.

01:59.535 --> 02:02.169
Chuck flew in and saved my ass.

02:02.203 --> 02:04.006
It's time to make some changes.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.843
Hey, listen, man. You're slippin' Jimmy.

02:06.878 --> 02:08.913
What do you got to change, huh?

02:08.947 --> 02:12.219
Everything. It's time to grow up.

02:12.254 --> 02:13.722
Yeah, according to who... Chuck?

02:13.756 --> 02:15.891
The same goes for you, man.

02:15.925 --> 02:19.094
You want to spend the rest
of your life on that stool?

02:19.128 --> 02:22.398
I mean, come on, Marco. Look at yourself.

02:22.432 --> 02:25.570
All right, that's him. I got to hit it.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.074
Geez. His master's voice.

02:28.108 --> 02:30.079
Really? Look, come on. Go outside.

02:30.113 --> 02:33.116
Tell Chuckles that you... you
got some business you forgot.

02:33.151 --> 02:34.283
- Marco.
- Come on.

02:34.318 --> 02:36.584
Y... you got to have one last blowout.

02:36.619 --> 02:38.088
We'll do the watch thing again,

02:38.122 --> 02:39.957
but... but maybe we'll pull that, uh...

02:39.991 --> 02:41.791
That tar-money scam you were talking about,

02:41.826 --> 02:43.962
- get some girls...
- I made a promise.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.296
Yeah, you made a promise, but it was...

02:45.331 --> 02:48.164
W... Whaddyamacallit? Under duress.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.968
Look, he got you out of jail, okay?

02:49.998 --> 02:52.965
But he's your brother. I mean,
what else is he gonna do?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.966
Marco, listen to me, all right?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.633
Chuck's not making me do this.

02:56.668 --> 02:58.968
He's giving me an opportunity,
and I'm grabbing it.

03:02.105 --> 03:04.205
Geez, it's like watching
Miles Davis give up the trumpet.

03:04.239 --> 03:07.941
What? What does that even mean?

03:07.975 --> 03:09.442
It's just a waste, is all I'm saying.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.784
All right, look. I'm gonna fly out there.

03:12.819 --> 03:16.287
I'm gonna get settled,
and I'll call you. Yeah?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.122
All right, Jimmy.

03:18.157 --> 03:20.592
Hey, have a safe flight, all right?!

Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk

04:22.035 --> 04:25.770
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:25.835 --> 04:28.140
What's up?

04:28.174 --> 04:30.642
Just waiting to talk to Howard.

04:30.676 --> 04:33.982
Can I ask about what?

04:34.016 --> 04:35.485
I'm taking your advice.

04:35.519 --> 04:39.322
I'm, uh, giving the case to HHM.

04:39.357 --> 04:41.325
Why?

04:41.359 --> 04:43.160
The fact that Chuck doesn't want me here

04:43.194 --> 04:45.195
has something to do with it.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.334
I'm so sorry.

04:50.368 --> 04:53.471
Why didn't you just tell me?

04:53.505 --> 04:54.572
I just...

04:54.606 --> 04:58.978
I didn't want you hating your own brother.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.853
How did you find out?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.623
Did Kim tell you?

05:06.657 --> 05:08.961
I figured it out on my own.

05:08.995 --> 05:12.298
It's about time, right?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.634
I brought the sandpiper stuff with me.

05:14.668 --> 05:16.302
It's down in my car.

05:16.337 --> 05:19.139
I figure your guys could do the outreach.

05:19.173 --> 05:21.176
If any of those geezers
don't want to sign with you,

05:21.210 --> 05:22.311
just give me their names.

05:22.346 --> 05:25.149
I'll talk them into it.

05:25.183 --> 05:29.817
You know, Jimmy, I never
wanted it to go this way.

05:29.852 --> 05:31.584
If it had been up to me,
we would have at least...

05:31.619 --> 05:33.652
Howard, I get it.

05:33.687 --> 05:37.659
Your brother's very important to the firm.

05:37.694 --> 05:40.160
Sorry I called you a pig fucker.

05:40.194 --> 05:43.667
Well...

05:43.701 --> 05:46.138
We owe you some money, don't we?

05:46.173 --> 05:51.481
The of-counsel fee...
I think we discussed $20,000.

05:51.515 --> 05:53.983
That and whatever the common-fund proceeds

05:54.018 --> 05:55.985
of sandpiper ultimately adds up to,

05:56.019 --> 05:57.654
you'll receive 20% of that...

05:57.688 --> 06:00.323
Should be a very nice payday
for you when it comes.

06:00.358 --> 06:01.592
Yep.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.431
I've got something for you, too.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.769
Uh, it's a shopping list for Chuck.

06:07.803 --> 06:08.937
I mean, he's doing better,

06:08.972 --> 06:10.608
but he still needs deliveries every day.

06:10.642 --> 06:13.777
I think he'd be more comfortable
with someone else doing it.

06:13.812 --> 06:15.447
I see.

06:15.482 --> 06:16.783
You don't have to do it personally.

06:16.817 --> 06:19.053
It just needs to get done.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.722
It's pretty straightforward.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.794
The ice is a pain in the ass,
but he needs it.

06:23.855 --> 06:26.490
I usually sneak into a motel
and fill a garbage bag,

06:26.522 --> 06:30.388
but you can have
whoever you hire just buy it.

06:30.422 --> 06:32.792
The most important thing is the newspapers.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.127
Uh, The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal...

06:35.161 --> 06:36.128
They're a must.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.295
There's a newsstand on Eubank

06:37.330 --> 06:39.263
that has both of them at 6:00 A.M.,

06:39.297 --> 06:41.432
which is good 'cause he's an early riser.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.668
The Albuquerque Journal he gets delivered,

06:42.702 --> 06:45.336
but somebody still has to
bring it in for him.

06:45.371 --> 06:48.339
You've been doing all of this every day...

06:48.373 --> 06:50.508
For over a year?

06:52.170 --> 06:54.604
You'll take care of this?

06:54.638 --> 06:55.942
Absolutely.

06:56.036 --> 06:58.003
I'll get it done and done right.

07:02.805 --> 07:05.509
I always liked you, Jimmy.

07:05.544 --> 07:06.612
Remember?

07:06.646 --> 07:09.281
I used to call you "Charlie Hustle."

07:09.315 --> 07:11.752
Yeah, I remember that.

07:23.863 --> 07:27.194
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

07:35.070 --> 07:37.835
That was nice.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.670
You sure you're all right?

07:39.704 --> 07:42.171
It's not a crime to let it out.

07:42.206 --> 07:45.006
There's nothing to let out.
Chuck's a sick man.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.674
That's no excuse.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.610
He's my brother.

07:49.644 --> 07:51.411
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

07:51.445 --> 07:53.580
There's nothing I can do to change that.

07:53.614 --> 07:56.916
What else is there to say?

07:56.950 --> 07:59.583
Wow. That's mature.

07:59.617 --> 08:02.218
Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.

08:14.439 --> 08:20.077
O-64, as in, "oh, to be 64 again!"

08:20.112 --> 08:22.583
O-64.

08:22.617 --> 08:28.257
All right. Next up... We got... N-32.

08:28.791 --> 08:34.261
"N" as in "Nancy... Reagan," a
first lady with a lot of style.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.731
Anybody else seen "Hellcats of the Navy"?

08:36.765 --> 08:40.732
All right. No winners yet?

08:40.767 --> 08:46.736
Okay, here's... B-2,
just like the B-2 bomber,

08:46.770 --> 08:48.204
the stealth...

08:48.239 --> 08:51.206
There's probably one taking off
over at Kirtland right now.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.611
We would never know because it's stealthy.

08:55.646 --> 08:58.577
Still no winners? No?

08:58.612 --> 09:00.077
Here we have...

09:02.349 --> 09:04.985
B-4, another "B." How about that?

09:05.019 --> 09:10.957
As in, "before too long, we're
gonna have another winner."

09:12.191 --> 09:14.727
No? Nobody? Okay.

09:14.761 --> 09:17.726
All right.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.762
And here comes...

09:22.132 --> 09:24.940
Hey, it's our old friend "B."

09:24.975 --> 09:27.311
B-12.

09:29.782 --> 09:33.419
"B," as in, uh...

09:33.453 --> 09:36.754
"B," as in...

09:36.788 --> 09:39.756
"Betrayal"...

09:39.790 --> 09:43.960
Benedict Arnold betrayed The United States.

09:43.994 --> 09:47.464
Still no winners.

09:47.498 --> 09:49.465
No?

09:49.499 --> 09:51.801
Okay.

09:51.835 --> 09:53.302
Here it is.

09:57.204 --> 10:00.005
Oh, what are the odds?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.007
Four B's in a row. That's...

10:04.543 --> 10:07.509
B-7.

10:07.543 --> 10:11.011
"B" as in...

10:11.045 --> 10:16.881
"B" as in..."Brother"... brother.

10:18.950 --> 10:22.085
B-7... "Seven brides for seven brothers."

10:22.119 --> 10:24.252
I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.

10:24.286 --> 10:25.955
It's not like mine, though.

10:25.989 --> 10:27.458
Any winners yet?

10:27.492 --> 10:29.459
Take a... take another look, okay?

10:29.494 --> 10:30.893
I'll wait.

10:30.928 --> 10:32.229
All I'm gonna say is,

10:32.264 --> 10:35.500
if it's another "B,"
could have a real problem here.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.638
And...

10:44.673 --> 10:49.475
Hey, it is another "B."

10:49.510 --> 10:51.812
B-5, as in,

10:51.847 --> 10:56.182
"boy, this 'B' thing is
really starting to tick me off."

10:56.217 --> 10:58.853
"B" as in "battleship."
"B" as in "bourbon."

10:58.887 --> 11:03.689
"B" as in "Belize"...
Beautiful place, so I've heard.

11:03.724 --> 11:05.855
I would love to go there.

11:05.889 --> 11:09.259
But, uh, let's face it...
That's never gonna happen.

11:09.293 --> 11:13.660
None of us is ever leaving
this godforsaken wasteland.

11:17.465 --> 11:19.231
Sorry.

11:19.265 --> 11:23.602
Scratch that. Moving on.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.343
I mean, what is it with this place?

11:27.377 --> 11:30.613
It's... it's like living
inside an easy-bake oven.

11:30.647 --> 11:31.778
I mean, look out that window.

11:31.813 --> 11:34.449
It's... it's like a soulless,

11:34.484 --> 11:37.288
radioactive Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe
hellscape out there,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.789
crawling with coral snakes
and scorpions and...

11:39.824 --> 11:42.292
You ever see the movie
"The Hills Have Eyes"?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.794
It's a documentary!

11:43.829 --> 11:46.131
God forbid your car breaks down...

11:46.165 --> 11:47.699
You have to walk 10 steps.

11:47.734 --> 11:49.703
You got a melanoma the size of a pineapple

11:49.737 --> 11:52.740
where your head used to be.

11:52.775 --> 11:55.042
And so you ask, "why?" Why?

11:55.077 --> 11:57.277
If... if that's how I feel,
why do I live here?

11:57.312 --> 11:59.613
Why?!

11:59.648 --> 12:01.583
Excuse me.

12:01.618 --> 12:02.920
Are you gonna read that number?

12:02.954 --> 12:06.424
Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.094
And it's another "B."

12:09.128 --> 12:12.930
It's another frigging "B." Boy, of course.

12:12.965 --> 12:16.270
Why not? Why not?!

12:16.304 --> 12:19.637
And the next number...

12:25.144 --> 12:27.778
Uh, quick question...

12:27.813 --> 12:30.114
Who here knows what a Chicago sunroof is?

12:30.148 --> 12:31.348
Anybody?

12:31.382 --> 12:34.851
You, sir? No? Okay.

12:34.886 --> 12:39.188
True story... uh, back home, uh,
there was this guy named Chet.

12:39.223 --> 12:41.696
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

12:41.731 --> 12:44.201
He might have owed me some money.

12:44.236 --> 12:46.868
He might have slept with my wife...

12:46.903 --> 12:49.707
Before she became my ex-wife.

12:49.741 --> 12:51.543
The details don't matter.

12:51.578 --> 12:55.380
Suffice it to say, I was wronged.

12:55.415 --> 12:57.884
All right, so, one summer evening,

12:57.919 --> 13:01.221
I was out having a few drinks...
One or two, maybe three.

13:01.255 --> 13:03.053
You get the picture?

13:03.087 --> 13:06.655
And, uh, who do I see? Chet.

13:06.690 --> 13:08.992
He drove up, and he double-parked

13:09.026 --> 13:11.994
outside a dairy queen and
went in to get some soft-serve.

13:12.029 --> 13:14.663
Now, Chet drove...
And this will give you an idea

13:14.697 --> 13:17.500
of exactly what kind
of a douchebag this guy was...

13:17.534 --> 13:21.003
Drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 series

13:21.037 --> 13:23.202
with white leather interior.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.872
So, I saw that thing,

13:25.907 --> 13:28.876
and I had... I'd had a few, like I said.

13:28.911 --> 13:32.880
And, uh... I climbed up top,

13:32.914 --> 13:37.553
and I may have...

13:37.588 --> 13:42.327
Defecated, uh, through the sunroof.

13:50.471 --> 13:54.608
Not my finest hour... I'll grant you that.

13:54.642 --> 13:57.111
But that's what a Chicago sunroof is.

13:57.146 --> 14:00.384
Now you know. It's a real thing.

14:00.418 --> 14:04.423
I didn't make it up. I'm not
the first person to do it.

14:04.457 --> 14:07.929
There's a name for it.

14:07.963 --> 14:12.436
Guy wanted some soft-serve...
I gave him some soft-serve.

14:12.471 --> 14:16.778
I did not know that his children
were in the backseat.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.615
There was a level of tint on the windows

14:19.649 --> 14:21.451
that I'll maintain to this day

14:21.485 --> 14:25.420
was not legal
in an Illinois-licensed vehicle.

14:25.455 --> 14:28.590
But somehow, that's on me, I guess.

14:30.157 --> 14:33.959
Who leaves two cub scouts
in a double-parked car

14:33.993 --> 14:36.295
with the engine running?!

14:36.329 --> 14:38.798
Come on.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.935
Now, Chet was connected, see?

14:40.969 --> 14:44.104
Like, uh, Cicero connected.

14:44.138 --> 14:46.942
So, usually, I'd be looking
at malicious mischief,

14:46.976 --> 14:49.611
public intoxication,
disorderly conduct, maybe,

14:49.645 --> 14:54.783
but he's got the D.A.
saying indecent exposure,

14:54.818 --> 14:57.251
calling me a sex offender. What?

14:57.285 --> 15:02.593
One little Chicago sunroof, and
suddenly I'm Charles Manson?!

15:02.627 --> 15:06.096
And that's where it all went off the rails.

15:06.131 --> 15:08.266
I've been paying for it ever since.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.635
That's why I'm here!

15:13.474 --> 15:14.943
I don't...

15:20.521 --> 15:23.655
You know what?

15:23.689 --> 15:26.824
Any of this stuff you want, come get it.

15:26.859 --> 15:31.832
Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.247
- What can I get you?
- Old style.

16:46.281 --> 16:47.380
Make it two.

16:47.415 --> 16:48.748
You got it.

16:50.284 --> 16:52.052
- What happened to Merna?
- Merna?

16:52.086 --> 16:53.253
She's doing all right.

16:53.287 --> 16:54.755
She's my step-mom.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.756
She don't come in much anymore.

16:58.459 --> 17:01.427
Tell her slippin' Jimmy says hello.

17:01.462 --> 17:04.432
- Slippin' Jimmy?
- Yeah, she'll know.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.967
I'll tell her. That'll be $5.50.

17:31.590 --> 17:33.558
Marco...

17:33.593 --> 17:35.894
You gorgeous hunk of a man...

17:37.029 --> 17:41.165
How long will you keep me waiting?

17:41.200 --> 17:44.835
Mnh! Wake up, you fat son of a bitch.

17:44.869 --> 17:46.004
Bought you a beer.

17:48.710 --> 17:51.213
- Jimmy?
- In the flesh.

17:53.317 --> 17:55.351
Hey.

17:55.385 --> 17:57.520
So, I'm not dark enough for you, huh?

17:57.554 --> 18:01.089
No, no. I'm just saying
I don't see any color.

18:01.124 --> 18:03.757
I mean, 10 years in the desert,
you should look like, uh,

18:03.792 --> 18:06.928
Anthony Quinn in "Lawrence of Arabia."

18:06.963 --> 18:09.964
Turks... They paid me a golden treasure!

18:09.999 --> 18:11.833
- Yet I am poor...
- Because I am a...

18:11.867 --> 18:13.669
- River to my people!
- River to my people!

18:13.703 --> 18:16.303
Well, hey, I'm Irish, okay?

18:16.401 --> 18:18.202
I spend my time staying out of the sun.

18:18.238 --> 18:20.174
Speaking of pale sons of bitches,

18:20.236 --> 18:22.203
how's your brother doing?

18:22.238 --> 18:24.040
Chuck's fine.

18:24.074 --> 18:25.375
Still working for him?

18:25.409 --> 18:27.378
Sometimes.

18:29.749 --> 18:33.049
What about you... I mean,
besides falling asleep on a bar

18:33.084 --> 18:35.885
at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon?

18:38.088 --> 18:40.024
"Lake Michigan Standpipe"?

18:40.059 --> 18:41.285
- What's that?
- My brother-in-law

18:41.310 --> 18:42.061
owns the company.

18:42.095 --> 18:43.662
Wait. Hold it. You got married?

18:43.696 --> 18:45.163
No, no, no. My... my...
My sister Angie's husband.

18:45.197 --> 18:46.398
Ah.

18:46.432 --> 18:47.733
So, what the hell's a standpipe?

18:47.767 --> 18:49.734
Standpipe... You know what a standpipe is.

18:49.768 --> 18:52.407
- I don't think so.
- Fire department comes.

18:52.442 --> 18:53.909
They stick one end of the hose
on the hydrant.

18:53.944 --> 18:55.677
The other end goes on the standpipe.

18:55.711 --> 18:57.177
The water goes out the standpipe,

18:57.211 --> 18:59.814
through the sprinklers,
and then douses the flames.

18:59.848 --> 19:00.984
It's important stuff.

19:01.018 --> 19:03.020
So, that's what a standpipe is, huh?

19:03.055 --> 19:06.521
Well, it's a dry standpipe.
There's also the wet standpipe.

19:06.555 --> 19:08.358
What's the difference?

19:08.392 --> 19:11.196
I don't know I-if I could
explain it to a layman.

19:15.199 --> 19:18.928
Excuse me. How's your mom?

19:18.963 --> 19:23.166
Oh, she passed away about three years ago.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.236
Ah. That's too bad. She was a great lady.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.071
Yeah. From Wisconsin, right?

19:29.105 --> 19:31.574
- Yeah.
- The funeral out there?

19:33.778 --> 19:36.013
No, it was... Here.

19:36.047 --> 19:39.016
Here?

19:39.050 --> 19:43.086
Yeah, well, we were only in town
for a few days, so...

19:45.954 --> 19:48.190
You were in town. You didn't look me up?

19:48.224 --> 19:50.260
Chuck was in the middle of a big case,

19:50.294 --> 19:52.361
and, uh, we couldn't stay around, so...

19:57.899 --> 19:59.366
Can I get you guys anything else?

19:59.400 --> 20:00.700
I'm good. You want anything?

20:00.735 --> 20:03.804
Nah. Your change here, too.

20:03.838 --> 20:05.640
Uh, yeah, okay. Hey.

20:05.674 --> 20:06.641
Thank you.

20:18.289 --> 20:20.258
How's my cutlass running?

20:20.293 --> 20:21.560
Gets me around.

20:22.695 --> 20:24.162
Well, it's a classic.

20:25.364 --> 20:28.834
Little bodywork, paint job...
Really be something.

20:32.771 --> 20:34.741
So, what you gonna do while you're here?

20:34.775 --> 20:36.411
I don't know.

20:36.445 --> 20:38.244
See the sights, you know,

20:38.278 --> 20:41.080
catch a Cubbies game from the bleachers,

20:41.114 --> 20:43.083
get a hot dog at Henry's.

20:44.183 --> 20:47.320
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:47.354 --> 20:48.820
Uh-huh.

20:50.354 --> 20:53.490
Correct.

20:53.524 --> 20:55.990
I'm gonna see them tomorrow.

20:56.025 --> 20:57.525
Yeah, both of them.

20:59.229 --> 21:02.865
Okay. Okay, bye.

21:02.899 --> 21:04.768
Is he a regular?

21:04.802 --> 21:06.237
No.

21:10.109 --> 21:12.811
You're buying, I'm selling.

21:16.516 --> 21:18.152
All right, then.

21:27.029 --> 21:29.696
All I'm asking is that you take a look.

21:29.731 --> 21:30.797
I'm sorry, buddy... no offense.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.465
I'm just... you know, I'm not interested.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.966
Come on, man.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.301
What's it gonna hurt to take a look?

21:35.335 --> 21:37.637
It'll take you two seconds.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.807
All right.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.810
All right. Show me what you got.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.812
Boom.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.817
Okay.

21:50.850 --> 21:52.482
Do you see it?

21:52.517 --> 21:55.417
I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

21:55.451 --> 21:57.585
Which way is he facing?

21:57.619 --> 21:59.252
JFK's facing left.

21:59.286 --> 22:02.423
Exactly.

22:02.457 --> 22:07.094
Hey, which way is he supposed to be facing?

22:07.129 --> 22:10.064
Right... he's supposed to be facing right.

22:10.098 --> 22:13.701
Okay, so why...
Why is this one facing left?

22:15.237 --> 22:20.544
November 22, 1963...
Kennedy is assassinated, right?

22:20.579 --> 22:22.877
The whole nation goes into mourning.

22:22.911 --> 22:25.410
They start naming
everything in sight after him.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.413
And the mint wants in on the act.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.418
So, in '64, they decide to
change the Lincoln half-dollar

22:30.452 --> 22:32.351
into the Kennedy half-dollar.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.021
When they design it,
they put Kennedy facing right,

22:35.055 --> 22:37.525
facing east, just the way they had Lincoln.

22:37.559 --> 22:39.361
- You know why?
- Mnh-mnh.

22:39.395 --> 22:41.030
He symbolizes the dawn.

22:41.064 --> 22:44.467
It's why pretty much every grave
everywhere faces east, you know?

22:44.502 --> 22:46.770
So the spirit of the dead person
faces the rising sun.

22:46.804 --> 22:49.103
You know, it's a death thing.
It's a burial thing.

22:49.137 --> 22:51.437
But there's one technician
in the Denver mint, right?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.943
And this guy... he believed
in, uh, the new frontier...

22:54.978 --> 22:56.546
Camelot, the whole deal.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.977
So, the assassination just destroyed him.

22:59.012 --> 23:01.313
When he sees that coin
with Kennedy facing east,

23:01.347 --> 23:04.653
facing the American past, pissed him off.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.487
And so he went rogue.

23:06.521 --> 23:07.987
Without telling anybody,

23:08.021 --> 23:11.288
he flipped things around
so that Kennedy was facing west,

23:11.323 --> 23:13.456
towards the new frontier, the future.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.791
Now, the mint struck about 3,000 of these

23:15.826 --> 23:17.126
before they figured it out.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.628
They canned the guy.

23:18.662 --> 23:21.464
About 1,000 of them made it out
into general circulation.

23:21.498 --> 23:23.299
They managed to get most of them back,

23:23.333 --> 23:25.636
melt them down, but...

23:25.670 --> 23:27.139
There are still...

23:27.173 --> 23:29.641
200-plus floating around out there.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.912
What's that? I didn't catch that.

23:33.947 --> 23:36.449
I didn't say anything.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.449
Do you mind, buddy?

23:37.483 --> 23:39.150
We're having a private conversation here.

23:41.957 --> 23:43.892
This one's not in perfect condition,

23:43.926 --> 23:46.094
but on the open market,

23:46.129 --> 23:50.268
I'd say it's worth... 600 or 800 bucks.

23:50.302 --> 23:51.602
$800?

23:51.636 --> 23:53.868
Yeah, but I'm hard up,

23:53.903 --> 23:57.541
so I'll take, uh, $100 for it.

23:57.575 --> 24:01.711
You want me to give you $100
for a half-dollar.

24:01.746 --> 24:06.851
I want you to give me $100
for an $800 coin.

24:06.885 --> 24:10.019
Yeah, I don't know, man. You know?

24:10.053 --> 24:11.855
I'm gonna go drain the snake.
Think about it.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.869
This guy's playing me, right?

24:22.904 --> 24:23.870
Definitely.

24:23.905 --> 24:26.174
Slick son of a bitch.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.878
You know, I should...

24:32.350 --> 24:35.650
You know what? I know this guy on wabash...

24:35.685 --> 24:37.653
Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's.

24:37.687 --> 24:39.654
Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?

24:39.689 --> 24:41.487
Local call. Keep it short.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.824
Right on.

24:43.859 --> 24:46.761
Let's see. Man.

24:46.795 --> 24:50.095
I'm gonna call this guy, and
when he tells me this is a scam,

24:50.130 --> 24:52.934
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call the cops

24:52.968 --> 24:55.070
and get this scumbag thrown in the can.

24:55.104 --> 24:56.304
You're my witness, okay?

24:57.940 --> 25:00.742
Facing west.

25:00.776 --> 25:04.246
My hairy ass.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.747
Hey. How you doing?

25:06.781 --> 25:09.750
Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew.

25:09.785 --> 25:12.587
Yeah, mm-hmm.

25:12.622 --> 25:15.423
Yeah, that's right.

25:15.457 --> 25:17.425
Hey, this is gonna sound like
the beginning of a bad joke,

25:17.460 --> 25:19.762
but, uh, I'm in this bar,
and I've got this guy

25:19.797 --> 25:21.430
spinning this cock-and-bull story

25:21.464 --> 25:24.098
about this, uh, 50-cent piece
he's trying to sell me.

25:24.133 --> 25:27.436
He says, uh...
Says Kennedy's supposed to be

25:27.470 --> 25:29.105
facing west or something.

25:31.742 --> 25:33.574
Yeah?

25:35.810 --> 25:38.943
Yeah.

25:38.977 --> 25:42.447
Mm-hmm.

25:42.481 --> 25:45.283
At the tone, the time will be 5:11 P.M.

25:45.317 --> 25:49.287
Yeah. That's what he said... Denver.

25:49.321 --> 25:52.259
Jesus. No kidding?

25:52.293 --> 25:53.760
- At the tone...
- Well, listen, I got to go.

25:53.795 --> 25:55.261
All right? Uh, thank you.

25:55.296 --> 25:57.765
And I owe you one.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.102
Thanks, Joey.

26:01.137 --> 26:03.471
So, what did he say?

26:03.505 --> 26:05.107
Yeah, you know, he...
He didn't really know much.

26:09.479 --> 26:12.113
I'll tell you what...
I'll give you $50 for it.

26:12.148 --> 26:14.850
$50? I'm taking a bath at $100.

26:14.884 --> 26:16.018
All right. Okay.

26:16.052 --> 26:19.019
Look, I got... $64 right here.

26:19.053 --> 26:21.022
It's an $800 coin, okay?

26:21.057 --> 26:22.859
I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.

26:22.893 --> 26:25.028
Okay, if you wait for me,
I'll get you 100 bucks.

26:25.063 --> 26:26.362
- I don't know.
- Okay.

26:27.497 --> 26:30.803
Hey, buddy, I got 75 bucks right here.

26:30.837 --> 26:33.139
I... I... sorry. I need $100.

26:33.173 --> 26:34.640
Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you.

26:34.675 --> 26:36.308
Mind your own business, okay?

26:36.343 --> 26:38.309
- Come on.
- Cash money... $80.

26:39.643 --> 26:41.644
Look, if you give me a chance,
I'll be back with $110.

26:41.679 --> 26:42.945
How long will that be? I don't know.

26:42.980 --> 26:44.579
I got to catch a train, come back...

26:44.614 --> 26:45.978
- Hour, hour and a half at the most.
- Yeah, you know, this guy

26:46.013 --> 26:47.780
- was getting ready to call the cops on you.
- No, I was not.

26:47.815 --> 26:48.735
What? Why would you do that? That...

26:48.760 --> 26:49.782
Now this guy is making shit up!

26:49.817 --> 26:51.616
Hey, I got $110 right here. That's...

26:51.650 --> 26:53.116
- Sold.
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:53.151 --> 26:54.450
This guy's got the cash. Now...

26:54.484 --> 26:55.952
- Don't do that.
- Here, take care of that.

26:55.986 --> 26:57.054
That's history right there.

26:57.088 --> 26:59.558
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Hey, money talks.

26:59.593 --> 27:00.725
You lost. It's over.

27:00.759 --> 27:02.725
No, it's not over. No, that's crap.

27:02.759 --> 27:04.060
And where do you think you're going, huh?

27:04.094 --> 27:05.295
Hey, back off, dude.

27:05.329 --> 27:08.299
Yeah, I'll back off
when you give me the JFK back.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.433
Hey, Joey, call the cops.

27:09.468 --> 27:10.901
This guy just tried to rip me off.

27:10.935 --> 27:12.436
Hey, this guy's a liar.
I did not rip anybody off.

27:12.470 --> 27:13.504
Yes, you did!

27:13.539 --> 27:15.074
You come back in here,
and your ass is grass!

27:15.108 --> 27:17.243
I got friends, buddy!

27:17.277 --> 27:20.245
Do you hear me?!
You double-dealing bastard!

27:20.279 --> 27:22.450
I got friends!

27:26.955 --> 27:29.423
You are so beautiful!

27:29.457 --> 27:31.258
Mwah!

27:31.292 --> 27:34.495
Hey, everybody, next round's on us!

27:43.176 --> 27:45.875
All right. Are you listening?

27:45.877 --> 27:47.577
Can you keep a secret?

27:47.675 --> 27:49.478
Yeah. Absolutely.

27:49.512 --> 27:52.648
Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi.

27:52.682 --> 27:54.484
He's 27 years old.

27:54.518 --> 27:56.652
He's a Nigerian prince, all right?

27:56.687 --> 28:00.992
He's worth, conservatively, $400 million.

28:01.026 --> 28:03.660
The dictatorship of equatorial Uqbar Orbis

28:03.694 --> 28:05.830
is detaining him on trumped-up charges.

28:05.865 --> 28:07.998
Now, the Abbassi family...
They're going crazy.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.999
They will reward whoever
helps them get their boy back.

28:11.034 --> 28:13.135
The hitch is,
the banks have frozen their...

28:13.169 --> 28:14.970
Assets... I'm talking Irish sweeps tickets,

28:15.005 --> 28:17.306
a whole trunk full of 'em.

28:17.340 --> 28:20.307
They're just sitting at O'Hare,
impounded in customs.

28:20.342 --> 28:22.310
Now, I know what
you're saying... "So what?"

28:22.344 --> 28:25.147
I can leave this as security,
but you got to understand...

28:25.181 --> 28:27.816
This violin is my livelihood.
It's a valuable antique.

28:27.850 --> 28:29.818
What do you mean it doesn't belong to you?

28:29.853 --> 28:32.487
I'll pay you 900 bucks
for this... cash on the barrel.

28:32.521 --> 28:34.489
I don't know. I hate to part with it.

28:34.523 --> 28:35.657
It's been in my family for years.

28:35.691 --> 28:36.659
You can keep a secret, right?

28:36.694 --> 28:37.795
Yeah, absolutely.

28:37.829 --> 28:39.629
But the point is, you need a good front,

28:39.663 --> 28:41.632
so you're gonna have
the most return on your dollars.

28:41.666 --> 28:43.301
But I know this customs officer...

28:43.335 --> 28:45.138
That money, then make it an investment.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.607
If the price is right.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.442
And I'm all about investments,
all about what's coming next.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.279
Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car

28:50.313 --> 28:51.781
out of this bad neighborhood.

28:51.816 --> 28:53.619
Sir, sir, could you help me?

28:53.654 --> 28:55.689
Tell me... are these today's numbers?

28:55.724 --> 28:57.858
Now, none of this was strictly legal,

28:57.892 --> 28:59.861
and the import taxes would have
been a killer... have at it.

28:59.895 --> 29:02.364
So he had to find a way to
get the money into the country

29:02.398 --> 29:04.134
without anyone knowing about it.

29:04.168 --> 29:06.137
He coated the cash with this black stuff...

29:06.171 --> 29:07.504
Vectrol paste.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.807
And the only way to get it off
is with a special chemical.

29:10.841 --> 29:13.042
It's not cheap, but the upside?

29:13.076 --> 29:14.809
The upside is huge.

29:14.844 --> 29:16.543
Can you keep a secret?

29:16.577 --> 29:18.378
You know, the guy in "dances with wolves"?

29:20.112 --> 29:22.246
A guy like you, who's got some money,

29:22.280 --> 29:23.581
who's got some money to throw around...

29:23.615 --> 29:25.918
Now, I know what
you're saying... "Who cares?"

29:25.952 --> 29:27.753
No matter which one wins,
we're gonna get a piece.

29:27.787 --> 29:29.421
He's got a gambling problem.

29:29.455 --> 29:31.589
Nobody can ever come after you,
but you get the profit.

29:31.623 --> 29:34.258
- The price is right.
- It's a win-win for you.

29:34.292 --> 29:35.759
It's a lose-lose for everybody else.

29:35.794 --> 29:38.095
You want to tell the guy you've got a 14.

29:38.130 --> 29:39.764
He checks...

29:39.798 --> 29:41.766
Realizes he's...
It's not gonna just be you.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.602
It's gonna be a piece of the pie.

29:43.636 --> 29:46.671
But you're gonna own a full
mountain range, guaranteed.

29:46.706 --> 29:48.840
Can you keep...

29:48.874 --> 29:49.942
A secret?

29:49.976 --> 29:51.177
'Cause I really...

29:51.212 --> 29:52.580
Really shouldn't...

29:52.614 --> 29:53.981
Shouldn't be telling you this.

30:11.161 --> 30:13.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:15.165 --> 30:18.537
You are not Kevin Costner.

30:18.572 --> 30:21.106
I was last night.

30:21.141 --> 30:24.777
Jesus.

30:24.812 --> 30:27.549
Asshole.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.052
I mean, seriously?

30:30.086 --> 30:31.219
Oh, my God.

30:31.253 --> 30:34.057
- Lucianne?! Lucianne!
- What?

30:34.091 --> 30:36.026
- He's not Kevin Costner.
- What?!

30:36.060 --> 30:37.360
Well, who's this guy?

30:37.395 --> 30:39.029
Uh, not Kevin Costner's manager.

30:39.064 --> 30:41.568
Oh, come on. Come on. Let's go.

30:41.602 --> 30:43.838
Uh, hang on. Got to get my dress on.

30:43.872 --> 30:46.172
Come on. Get the hell out of this dump.

30:47.274 --> 30:49.178
So, are you sure he's not a manager?

30:49.212 --> 30:52.185
Yes, Luci, I am sure.

30:52.219 --> 30:54.187
But he said he was gonna give me his card.

30:54.221 --> 30:56.020
Does this look like a manager's place?

30:56.054 --> 30:57.456
- Maybe.
- Can I interest you

30:57.481 --> 30:58.857
ladies in some mimosas?

30:58.891 --> 31:01.559
At least stick around
long enough to get dressed.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.394
Oh, oh. Screw you.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.696
If you build it, I will come.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.198
Lucy, come on.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.535
Okay. Bye.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.372
Come on.

31:11.406 --> 31:13.745
That door sticks.

31:13.779 --> 31:14.745
Yeah, okay. I got it.

31:14.780 --> 31:15.746
Okay.

31:15.781 --> 31:17.982
Go. Go.

31:18.016 --> 31:19.820
Okay.

32:16.450 --> 32:19.384
You have 15 messages.

32:19.418 --> 32:21.220
This is Greta Muller.

32:21.254 --> 32:23.387
I wanted to check to see if my wi...

32:24.554 --> 32:25.852
My name's Gary Albert Arnold.

32:25.887 --> 32:27.521
I'd like to discuss making a...

32:27.555 --> 32:29.190
Hi, Mr. McGill.

32:29.224 --> 32:31.193
I'm calling on behalf of my mother.

32:31.228 --> 32:32.531
She's in assisted living, and...

32:34.500 --> 32:36.133
Uh, yes, Mr. McGill,
this is Manny Hollinger...Again.

32:36.168 --> 32:37.301
Uh, I hate to...

32:38.504 --> 32:40.805
So, what's it gonna be today, pal?

32:40.839 --> 32:45.074
I'm up for anything and everything.

32:45.108 --> 32:48.744
Marco, I'm sorry. I got to go back.

32:48.779 --> 32:51.578
What?

32:51.613 --> 32:55.246
Uh, it's be great, and I
appreciate your hospitality,

32:55.281 --> 32:58.083
but a week's gonna have to do it.

32:58.117 --> 33:00.418
I got to go home.

33:00.452 --> 33:03.251
I already called in sick.

33:03.286 --> 33:06.423
Come on, man.

33:06.459 --> 33:08.595
This is home. Y-you hate it out there.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.031
What do you got to go back to?

33:10.065 --> 33:12.898
My clients.

33:12.933 --> 33:14.902
Clients.

33:14.937 --> 33:20.074
What... what are you...
Like a gigolo or something?

33:20.108 --> 33:24.243
Uh, Marco...

33:24.277 --> 33:26.576
I'm a lawyer.

33:26.610 --> 33:28.411
What?

33:28.445 --> 33:29.613
Honest to God.

33:29.648 --> 33:32.948
I do elder law,
which is like wills and estates.

33:32.983 --> 33:34.549
So you're ripping off old people?

33:34.583 --> 33:36.818
No, I'm not ripping off old people.

33:36.853 --> 33:38.754
I'm not ripping off anybody.

33:38.788 --> 33:42.555
Holy crap. Slippin' Jimmy's a lawyer?

33:42.589 --> 33:44.922
No wonder you want to go back.

33:44.957 --> 33:47.722
I mean, you got to be king of the desert,

33:47.757 --> 33:51.024
driving around town
in a white caddy, making bank.

33:51.059 --> 33:52.358
I'm not making bank.

33:52.393 --> 33:54.259
I'm making a living, more or less.

33:54.294 --> 33:55.260
A living?

33:55.294 --> 33:56.463
All due respect,

33:56.498 --> 33:58.967
you're a lawyer and you're not making bank,

33:59.002 --> 34:00.303
you're doing it wrong.

34:00.337 --> 34:02.637
Well, I'm building something. Takes time.

34:02.671 --> 34:04.306
Well, you're gonna build
something, build it out here.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.809
I mean, lawyers in Chicago
make plenty... I assure you.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.811
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you, Marco. I...

34:09.844 --> 34:11.478
Chuck's in Albuquerque.

34:11.513 --> 34:14.649
Again, all due respect...
Chuck's a stuck-up douchebag.

34:14.683 --> 34:18.951
I hate to break it to you,
but he doesn't even like you.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.455
He's my brother.

34:24.791 --> 34:26.759
Okay.

34:26.793 --> 34:30.096
I... I get it... family.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.630
You got to go back. But...

34:40.473 --> 34:42.775
Remember this?

34:42.811 --> 34:44.447
The rolex thing. What...

34:44.482 --> 34:46.447
Whatever happened to the guy
who used to sell us those?

34:46.483 --> 34:49.114
Jin Kang? He got deported.

34:49.149 --> 34:53.484
This is the last one. I say we go for it.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.152
No. Oh, come on.

34:55.187 --> 34:56.621
Last time, we did what? $600?

34:56.655 --> 34:59.356
The hot streak we're on,
I bet we break a grand, easy.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.590
I could lend you some cash.

35:01.624 --> 35:03.425
I don't need the money, Jimmy.

35:03.459 --> 35:04.992
I need this.

35:05.027 --> 35:06.127
Come on.

35:06.161 --> 35:07.962
You say you're happy
doing wills or whatever,

35:07.997 --> 35:09.929
good for you, man, seriously.

35:09.964 --> 35:10.996
But I got to tell you...

35:11.030 --> 35:14.833
Standpipes ain't cutting it for me, man.

35:14.867 --> 35:17.802
I got nothing, Jimmy.

35:17.837 --> 35:20.068
Give me this.

35:21.903 --> 35:23.203
Give me this, man.

35:23.238 --> 35:24.538
I can't do it.

35:24.572 --> 35:26.172
Come on. Give me this.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.306
Marco. Give me this.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.141
Come on. Come on. Buddy, listen to me.

35:29.175 --> 35:30.309
I'm listening. Come on.

35:30.343 --> 35:31.644
Hey. Just one last time.

35:31.679 --> 35:32.980
Come on. I'm not being hypnotized.

35:33.014 --> 35:34.815
No? Okay. Come on, one more time.

35:34.850 --> 35:35.950
I can't do it.

35:35.985 --> 35:37.386
Just one more... one more.

35:37.420 --> 35:38.889
Hey, listen to me. Just listen to you.

35:38.924 --> 35:40.425
- Yeah, I'm listening. Come on.
- No.

36:46.332 --> 36:49.970
Yeah!

36:50.004 --> 36:51.304
It's got to come from the gut, man.

36:51.339 --> 36:52.473
Yeah. Yeah.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.146
Oh, that's crazy.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.980
Just like a wolf. Go ahead.

36:59.015 --> 37:00.815
No, deeper, deeper.

37:01.951 --> 37:04.920
Yeah, and you do that
right at the moment of,

37:04.954 --> 37:06.254
you know, pure joy...

37:06.288 --> 37:08.255
Yeah... And it will escalate it 10...

37:08.289 --> 37:10.761
10 times.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.596
- There's something...
- Hey.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.797
- It's prehistoric.
- Hey, hey. Look.

37:24.448 --> 37:27.751
$50, $200, $400.

37:27.786 --> 37:29.589
Whose is it? I don't know.

37:30.659 --> 37:32.294
There's got to be 1,000 bucks in here.

37:32.328 --> 37:35.296
Somebody must have...

37:35.330 --> 37:37.965
Oh.

37:37.999 --> 37:40.169
Oh, damn.

37:50.118 --> 37:51.919
Is he, uh...

37:51.954 --> 37:53.288
I don't know.

38:25.916 --> 38:29.718
Hey, buddy, you with us?

38:29.752 --> 38:33.556
Look, the guy's just had too many.

38:33.591 --> 38:37.559
I say we move on. You want to split this?

38:37.593 --> 38:40.230
Marco, you okay?

38:40.265 --> 38:42.231
Marco?

38:42.265 --> 38:43.731
What... do you know this guy?

38:43.765 --> 38:46.235
Hey, call 911.

38:46.269 --> 38:48.608
Call 911!

38:51.244 --> 38:52.579
Hey!

38:58.754 --> 39:00.054
I need an ambulance.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.723
My friend's having a heart attack.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.728
We're in an alley,

39:03.762 --> 39:05.629
uh, southeast of Lasalle and Shermer.

39:05.663 --> 39:07.464
No, I-i don't know.

39:07.498 --> 39:08.798
He was like this when I found him.

39:08.832 --> 39:10.265
Hey, hold...

39:10.300 --> 39:12.032
Marco, Marco, you with me?

39:12.066 --> 39:14.534
You with me? I screwed up.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.903
No, you did... you did good, buddy.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.404
Just hold on, all right?
They're on their way.

39:18.438 --> 39:19.738
They'll be here in a minute.

39:19.772 --> 39:20.738
Jimmy, you know what?

39:20.773 --> 39:22.073
Just s-save your breath, okay?

39:22.107 --> 39:23.540
You're gonna be fine.

39:23.575 --> 39:27.278
This was the greatest week of my life.

39:32.951 --> 39:35.253
Hey.

39:35.287 --> 39:36.755
Hey, hey, hey.

39:36.789 --> 39:37.989
Hang in there! Hey!

39:38.023 --> 39:41.323
Hey! Hey!

39:41.358 --> 39:42.659
Hey, wake up, man!

39:42.693 --> 39:45.762
Come on! Marco, buddy!

39:48.365 --> 39:49.665
Help!

39:51.701 --> 39:53.569
Anybody!

39:56.801 --> 39:58.002
Marco!

40:09.400 --> 40:12.034
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, hey, bud.

40:12.100 --> 40:13.935
Can I bum one?

40:24.252 --> 40:26.219
Is that his?

40:26.253 --> 40:30.225
Yeah. His mom gave it to me.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.726
Thought it looked familiar.

40:31.761 --> 40:33.225
I figured I'd wear it today,

40:33.260 --> 40:35.059
but I don't know.

40:35.092 --> 40:37.059
I'm not a big ring guy, so...

40:38.527 --> 40:42.196
Still. Could be worth a couple of bucks.

40:56.210 --> 40:58.511
Better head back.

40:58.546 --> 41:00.382
See you inside.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.481
Hey.

41:24.515 --> 41:26.652
Is this Ferris Bueller?

41:26.686 --> 41:28.488
Speaking.

41:28.523 --> 41:30.121
I don't want to interrupt your big day off.

41:30.156 --> 41:32.123
Just checking in. What are you up to?

41:32.157 --> 41:35.127
You know, burning down the place.

41:35.162 --> 41:36.764
I wouldn't expect any less.

41:36.798 --> 41:42.272
So, whatever it was, did you
get it out of your system?

41:42.306 --> 41:44.275
Yep, all gone.

41:44.310 --> 41:47.111
Good. I want to run something by you.

41:47.145 --> 41:50.446
The sandpiper case...
It's getting too big for hhm.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.647
Howard's decided to partner
with another firm.

41:52.682 --> 41:54.816
Davis and Main. You heard of them?

41:54.850 --> 41:56.985
- Sure, up in Santa Fe.
- Right.

41:57.020 --> 42:01.421
Well, they've heard of you, too,
and they're interested.

42:01.455 --> 42:03.587
They want to make you an offer
contingent on an interview.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.253
They've got a partner-track
position in mind.

42:05.287 --> 42:06.420
Wait. What?

42:06.454 --> 42:08.924
Partner track? What are you talking about?

42:08.958 --> 42:10.590
I'm talking about
there's an office in Santa Fe

42:10.625 --> 42:13.592
with your name on it, or there could be,

42:13.626 --> 42:16.030
and you'd be working on your case.

42:16.064 --> 42:19.634
I... well, I...

42:19.669 --> 42:23.170
I don't even, uh...

42:23.204 --> 42:25.705
Chuck wouldn't like it.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.373
Chuck has no say in this.

42:27.407 --> 42:28.874
You wouldn't be working for HHM,

42:28.908 --> 42:31.543
and Chuck can't tell
Davis and Main who to hire.

42:31.577 --> 42:32.677
Why me?

42:32.712 --> 42:34.847
Is this like a tax write-off
or a charity thing?

42:34.881 --> 42:36.280
What's the angle, huh?

42:36.315 --> 42:38.950
Jimmy, we've been talking to your clients,

42:38.984 --> 42:40.152
the sandpiper residents,

42:40.186 --> 42:42.489
and they ask about you
every chance they get.

42:42.523 --> 42:44.992
I don't know what it is,
but you have a way with them.

42:45.026 --> 42:48.196
Hey. Old people love me.

42:48.230 --> 42:52.368
So... Sounds good?

42:55.571 --> 42:58.874
Kim, I can't imagine what
you did to make this happen.

42:58.908 --> 43:01.476
Thank you.

43:01.510 --> 43:02.810
I didn't do anything... much.

43:02.845 --> 43:06.481
And believe it or not,
Howard's been pushing this, too.

43:06.515 --> 43:08.083
Good, old Howard.

43:08.118 --> 43:10.254
Listen, we're gonna be down
in judge Murray's court

43:10.289 --> 43:11.922
on Thursday at 11:00.

43:11.956 --> 43:13.923
The Davis and Main people will be there.

43:13.957 --> 43:16.091
It'd be the perfect chance
for you to meet them.

43:16.125 --> 43:18.259
Thursday at 11:00.
All right, I'll be there.

43:18.294 --> 43:19.762
Thanks, Kim, really.

43:19.796 --> 43:21.598
I'll see you then.

43:32.946 --> 43:35.917
All the originals
need to be copied and filed.

43:35.951 --> 43:38.589
See, I've written right here
on the box... "Copy and file."

43:38.624 --> 43:40.259
That's to make it as clear as possible.

43:40.294 --> 43:42.594
Got it, Mr. Mcgill. Anything else?

43:42.629 --> 43:43.928
Well, on the grocery front,

43:43.963 --> 43:45.764
almost everything was right this time.

43:45.798 --> 43:47.600
- Great.
- Almost.

43:47.635 --> 43:50.071
Um, it's a small thing, but to my taste,

43:50.106 --> 43:52.241
the, uh, Granny Smith apples
are a bit too tart.

43:52.275 --> 43:54.244
- Those are the green ones, right?
- Right.

43:54.279 --> 43:57.080
I prefer the red ones,
but not red delicious.

43:57.114 --> 43:58.948
Those are generally tasteless.

43:58.982 --> 44:00.582
Fujis should be in season.

44:00.616 --> 44:03.053
It's not a major issue, but...

44:03.088 --> 44:04.723
- Yeah.
- Fuji apples.

44:04.757 --> 44:05.723
Okay.

44:05.758 --> 44:07.722
Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk,

44:07.756 --> 44:08.956
so maybe a half gallon of that.

44:08.991 --> 44:11.127
You got it.

44:11.161 --> 44:12.628
Well, thank you, Ernesto.

44:12.663 --> 44:16.296
I appreciate your attention to detail.

44:16.330 --> 44:19.999
Do you need to write any of this down?

44:20.033 --> 44:21.833
'Cause it's okay if you do.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.668
You know, just to be sure.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.839
So, Fuji apples.

44:45.900 --> 44:47.199
Hey, Ernie.

44:47.233 --> 44:49.034
Hey. How you doing, man?

44:49.069 --> 44:50.203
Good, good.

44:50.237 --> 44:52.869
So, Howard's got you
looking after Chuck, huh?

44:52.904 --> 44:54.804
Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?

44:54.839 --> 44:56.174
How's he doing?

44:56.209 --> 44:58.343
Seems okay, like usual.

44:58.377 --> 45:00.176
I'd say we could grab a beer,

45:00.210 --> 45:02.345
but they're waiting on all that
paperwork back at the office...

45:02.380 --> 45:03.681
You know how it is.

45:03.715 --> 45:05.350
Don't I, though?

45:05.384 --> 45:07.017
See you, Jimmy.

45:07.052 --> 45:08.884
Uh, see you 'round, ernie.

45:47.553 --> 45:52.024
You done business with him before?

45:52.059 --> 45:53.693
Right.

45:53.728 --> 45:56.361
Yeah. I'll be there.

46:24.622 --> 46:27.090
Davis and Main and Mcgill.

46:29.258 --> 46:30.892
Great to meet you.

46:30.926 --> 46:33.557
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

46:33.591 --> 46:35.892
It's good to meet you.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.094
Nice...

47:03.951 --> 47:05.651
Well, that was quick.

47:05.686 --> 47:08.320
- No charge.
- Help me out here.

47:08.354 --> 47:14.326
Did I dream it, or did I have
$1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

47:14.761 --> 47:17.564
When I close my eyes, I can still see it.

47:17.598 --> 47:20.798
It's burned into my retinas
like I was staring into the sun.

47:20.832 --> 47:23.467
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.

47:23.502 --> 47:25.137
We could have split it 50/50.

47:25.171 --> 47:31.140
We could have gone home
with $800,000 each, tax-free.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.644
Your point being?

47:33.678 --> 47:36.279
Why didn't we? What stopped us?

47:36.314 --> 47:40.247
I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

47:40.281 --> 47:42.751
I don't even know what that means.

47:44.021 --> 47:45.988
You want to know
why I didn't take that money?

47:46.022 --> 47:47.990
Is that what you're asking?

47:48.024 --> 47:50.126
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.462
Me, personally... I was hired to do a job.

47:53.497 --> 47:56.533
I did it. That's as far as it goes.

47:56.567 --> 48:00.538
Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me.

48:00.572 --> 48:04.374
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
