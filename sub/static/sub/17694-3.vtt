WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.469
(crickets chirping)

00:03.471 --> 00:08.107
(sneaky music playing)

00:08.109 --> 00:09.641
(lowered voice) All clear?

00:09.643 --> 00:11.210
(lowered voice)
On my signal.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.445
Go, go, go! We gotta
get out before Hayley --

00:13.447 --> 00:14.780
Dad?
(normal voice) Hayley's home!

00:14.782 --> 00:16.782
(switch clicks)
Hey, girl!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.118
What's going on?
Nothing or whatever.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.654
Wait a minute. Dad's wearing
his special eating pants,

00:22.656 --> 00:25.290
and Mom's got Tupperware labeled
"Cheesecake Warehouse."

00:25.292 --> 00:27.993
(gasps) You're going
to the Cheesecake Warehouse!

00:27.995 --> 00:30.629
Ugh. Now I suppose everybody
has to listen to a thing.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.631
Did you know
the Cheesecake Warehouse

00:32.633 --> 00:33.999
makes $2 billion a year

00:34.001 --> 00:35.667
while their employees
make minimum wage?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.469
It's not fair!

00:37.471 --> 00:40.205
Hayley, let me break this down
like the great Vanessa Williams

00:40.207 --> 00:41.907
in "A Diva's Christmas Carol."

00:41.909 --> 00:45.811
¶ Don't be so serious,
there must be some mistake ¶

00:45.813 --> 00:50.549
¶ Am I delirious
or do you want a cheesecake? ¶

00:50.551 --> 00:53.852
The Cheesecake Warehouse is
the leading cause of diabetes

00:53.854 --> 00:55.087
in the state of Virginia.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.388
(all groan)

00:56.390 --> 00:58.323
Hayley, you're always
ranting --

00:58.325 --> 01:00.993
"This isn't fair,
that isn't fair,

01:00.995 --> 01:02.694
"children don't belong
in factories,

01:02.696 --> 01:05.230
I shouldn't print out
all my e-mails."

01:05.232 --> 01:06.999
(scoffs)
You're such a downer.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.368
Being opinionated
doesn't make me a downer.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.669
Tell 'em, Jeff.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.104
Well...

01:12.106 --> 01:14.006
I can't believe this.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.075
I'm used to hearing it
from them, but...

01:16.077 --> 01:18.243
It's not you. It's just...

01:18.245 --> 01:21.780
You kinda have a frowny face,
which can put people off.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.016
If you just did this...

01:24.018 --> 01:25.551
That's what I'm --

01:25.553 --> 01:26.785
Hayley's back.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.353
It's just how I look,
okay?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.522
Actually,
that's not true.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.858
You were the happiest
little 6-year-old.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.060
Remember
her beautiful smile?

01:35.062 --> 01:37.596
I had to fight
the kidnappers away.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.897
Seriously?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.799
Is it really so hard
to believe?

01:40.801 --> 01:43.235
I mean,
am I so horrible?

01:43.237 --> 01:45.104
Is it<i> that</i> impossible
to be around me?

01:45.106 --> 01:48.207
(tires screech, engine revs)

01:48.209 --> 01:52.311
¶ We made a getaway
'cause Hayley's hard to take ¶

01:52.313 --> 01:56.648
¶ Dad put the pedal down,
we're gonna eat a cheesecake ¶

01:56.650 --> 01:59.084
¶¶

01:59.086 --> 02:02.387
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:02.389 --> 02:05.757
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:05.759 --> 02:08.827
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:08.829 --> 02:13.198
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:15.069 --> 02:18.170
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:18.172 --> 02:20.639
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:20.641 --> 02:22.007
Aah!

02:23.611 --> 02:26.678
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:26.680 --> 02:28.747
(crickets chirping)

02:28.749 --> 02:31.116
Hey, babe,
what you doing?

02:31.118 --> 02:34.086
Oh, why'd you get out
your paper facebook?

02:34.088 --> 02:38.490
Look at this.
i-I'm smiling in every picture.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.461
It's weird, but I don't
remember any of this.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.030
I guess 'cause drugs.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.832
"Happy Hayley"?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.800
God, what happened to me?

02:48.802 --> 02:50.636
I mean, my family's
avoiding me.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.204
What if I drive you away?

02:52.206 --> 02:55.474
Babe, that'll never happen.
I got nowhere else to go.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.443
Oh, happy Hayley.
Those were the days.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.046
Oh, my God!
How are you doing that?

03:01.048 --> 03:03.815
I'm from outer space, Jeff.
I can do lots of cool shit.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.919
Here's a little sump'n sump'n
I learned on Vega Five.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.122
(groans)

03:10.124 --> 03:11.623
<i> You</i> remember happy Hayley?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.292
What? Oh, sure.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.960
Always smiling.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.728
(baby voice)
You were a bunny-wunny.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.498
You were a sweetie-cutie-
baby-honey-pie.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.167
You were tooshy-wooshy-
boohjy-boohjy.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.969
(normal voice) And now
I'm indifferent to you.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.837
Oh, I wish I could remember
what it felt like

03:25.839 --> 03:27.139
to be that happy.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.740
You can.
Make an appointment

03:28.742 --> 03:30.976
to see Dr. Penguin
for hypnotherapy.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.478
Roger, I don't want you
messing around with my head.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.048
Happy Hayley
at the petting zoo?!

03:36.050 --> 03:38.517
Oh, I just
wanna love her forever!

03:38.519 --> 03:40.085
Is Dr. Penguin
available now?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.587
We can probably
squeeze you in,

03:41.589 --> 03:43.021
but we don't take
insurance.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.590
We don't know how.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.027
(school bell rings)

03:49.029 --> 03:50.596
So we're at
the cheesecake warehouse,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.698
and Charlotte comes over.
We're in her section.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.266
Nice.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.235
And I said, "Charlotte,
I want you to take away

03:56.237 --> 03:57.736
"this fork and knife

03:57.738 --> 03:59.338
and bring me some pork
I can eat with a spoon."

03:59.340 --> 04:01.406
(chuckles) She laughs
and probably forgets

04:01.408 --> 04:03.442
about her blind son
for a moment.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.777
But when the pork comes,
oh, my God.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.379
What is it, Steve?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.915
It was stringy,
tough, chewy even.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.717
I had to ask for
my knife and fork back.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.118
(all gasp)

04:13.120 --> 04:14.553
Charlotte had to do
the walk of shame

04:14.555 --> 04:16.088
to the utensil station,

04:16.090 --> 04:18.590
and I went home
with a gut full of hard pork.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.559
(lowered voice) Yo,
couldn't help but overhear.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.895
You boys in the market
for some soft pork?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.431
Oh, dear.
You want the perfect pork?

04:26.433 --> 04:30.269
You gotta get yourself
a<i> slow</i> cooker.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.637
Get outta here, tim.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.972
You're not even
a real pervert.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.742
A slow cooker really
makes that much of a difference?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.977
After you do a slow cook,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.313
you'll never look at pork
the same way again.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.216
Whoa! Message received,
buddy.

04:44.218 --> 04:48.253
Before I give you this,
there's one thing to remember.

04:48.255 --> 04:52.257
The slower the cook,
the better the taste.

04:52.259 --> 04:56.328
The slower the cook,
the better the taste.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.730
The slower the cook...

04:58.732 --> 05:01.166
(whispers)
The better the taste.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.001
(all gasp)

05:03.003 --> 05:05.437
That guy's so weird
about pork.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.307
Anyway...
(deep voice) I'm Batman.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.809
(birds chirping)

05:10.811 --> 05:12.511
So here's how it works.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.147
I do hypnotherapy to help
people better themselves,

05:15.149 --> 05:17.749
to stop smoking...
or start smoking.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.284
I do both,
whichever's easier.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.119
One's<i> way</i> easier.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.655
Anyhow, we'll use hypnotherapy
to bring you back

05:23.657 --> 05:25.590
to when you were 6,
and we'll find out

05:25.592 --> 05:27.326
what made you so happy.

05:27.328 --> 05:31.930
You're 6 years old again.
6 years old.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.532
With every swing
of the watch,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.334
you go a little deeper.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.903
Happy Hayley.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.540
Hayley's still in there
with Dr. Penguin?

05:41.542 --> 05:42.874
How long has it been?

05:42.876 --> 05:44.376
I don't know, Mr. S.

05:44.378 --> 05:47.279
Hayley usually keeps track
of how long I sit.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.716
(door opens)

05:50.718 --> 05:52.117
Roger! Snap out of it!

05:52.119 --> 05:54.286
Oh, my God.
I think I did it.

05:54.288 --> 05:57.356
I quit!
I quit not smoking!

05:57.358 --> 05:59.057
I gotta get a ciggy!

05:59.059 --> 06:00.959
Hayley,
are you all right?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.528
(high-pitched childish voice)
Daddy! Can we get ice cream?

06:03.530 --> 06:05.297
Pretty, pretty please?!

06:05.299 --> 06:09.167
Yeah, sure, if you can
tell me how old you are.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.870
Silly Daddy. I'm 6!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.638
What?
Roger, what did you --

06:13.640 --> 06:15.240
(joint cracks)
Uhh!

06:15.242 --> 06:17.409
(strained voice)
My back! It's the L-5!

06:17.411 --> 06:21.213
(groans) Must...get to...
Vicodin stash.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.382
Horsey ride! (giggles)
(grunting)

06:23.384 --> 06:25.183
Whoa! Ride 'em, girl!

06:25.185 --> 06:27.386
(laughing)
Ah!

06:27.388 --> 06:30.789
(slurring) This was supposed
to be a fun night. (cries)

06:34.161 --> 06:35.727
(birds chirping)

06:35.729 --> 06:37.429
One, two, three...

06:37.431 --> 06:38.864
Roger, we can't have
a grown woman

06:38.866 --> 06:40.265
acting like a child.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.267
This ain't
no Disney Channel.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.870
...9, 10!
Couch attack!

06:44.872 --> 06:46.571
Uhh!

06:46.573 --> 06:48.573
Roger,
hypnotize Hayley back.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.042
Okay, okay, just let me finish
this last one.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.412
(inhales deeply)

06:53.414 --> 06:57.449
(gulps)
Smoking's so glamorous.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.784
(lighter clicks)

07:00.287 --> 07:03.588
You're not 6 anymore.
You're not 6 anymore.

07:03.590 --> 07:07.125
Tag! You're it!
(giggling)

07:07.127 --> 07:10.529
There's fishy!<i> Fishy!</i>

07:10.531 --> 07:13.532
Oh, no. Happy Hayley,
my mortal enemy.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.866
The monster is back.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.303
Hurricane fishy!

07:18.305 --> 07:20.105
Ugh. This is my fault

07:20.107 --> 07:22.441
for not putting up
sandbags.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.942
(birds chirping)

07:23.944 --> 07:27.446
Mommy, I'm hungry.
Can I have a hot dog?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.481
<i> You</i> want a hot dog?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.316
And some
mint chip ice cream.

07:31.318 --> 07:35.454
Why, uh, of course, honey.
I'll whip that up right now.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.223
You're the best mommy
ever!

07:38.225 --> 07:39.624
Hey!

07:39.626 --> 07:41.726
This is my chance
to raise her right.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.329
(inhales) Get her
into child acting...

07:44.331 --> 07:47.098
(exhaling deeply)
Make some cash.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.234
Daddy's home!

07:49.236 --> 07:51.770
Look, Daddy, I made you
a friendship bracelet.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.939
It means we're BFFs --
best friends forever.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.107
But you can't ever take it off,
or else I'll know.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.742
'Kay, promise you'll
never take it off?

07:57.744 --> 08:00.345
I promise. I've been meaning
to get rid of my old one.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.316
(gasps) He promised
he'd never take it off!

08:04.318 --> 08:06.618
(voice breaking)
You're supposed to wear them

08:06.620 --> 08:08.587
until they fall off!

08:08.589 --> 08:10.789
It's in the rules!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.424
(crickets chirping)

08:13.527 --> 08:16.361
So, babe, I'm just curious.

08:16.363 --> 08:20.131
I'm not really sure how
you feel about<i> us</i> right now.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.434
I love you.
You're my best friend.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.769
Oh, that's so great
to hear.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.438
I love you, too,
Hayles.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.540
It's so awesome
you're a princess.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.442
What's that, Anna?

08:30.444 --> 08:33.845
There's a stinky, hairy ogre
in the room?

08:35.315 --> 08:38.783
You and your pee-pee
are gross.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.452
(ticks, dings)

08:40.454 --> 08:43.288
All right!
The roast is finally done.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.158
Eight hours without food.
It's like I'm a poor!

08:47.160 --> 08:49.394
Wait. Remember what
the salesman said

08:49.396 --> 08:51.162
four times in the alley?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.398
The slower the cook,
the better the taste.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.067
I say we double the time.
Or why stop there?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.469
Let's double the double.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.304
(moans)
(timer winds)

08:59.306 --> 09:02.040
This pork isn't coming out
until it's absolutely perfect.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.142
Well, I've always said
I'm not gonna come out

09:04.144 --> 09:07.312
until<i> I'm</i> absolutely perfect.
(gasps)

09:09.416 --> 09:11.716
Hey, guys, we need
to talk about Hayley.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.385
Isn't she great?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.587
Look, she made me this
sweet-ass friendship bracelet.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.822
Oh, did you not get one?
Aw.

09:17.824 --> 09:21.593
No, guys, this is bad!
My wife is 6!

09:21.595 --> 09:24.062
Oh, children are more sexual
than we realize.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.531
It was my work in that area
that cemented my tenure

09:26.533 --> 09:28.066
at the University
of the Ozarks.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.367
Go, Possums!

09:29.369 --> 09:31.236
Don't be selfish, Jeff.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.705
Hayley's finally happy
again.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.675
She eats everything, and she
lets me dress her up

09:36.677 --> 09:38.043
however I want.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.045
Mommy, look!
I'm as pretty as you!

09:40.047 --> 09:41.746
Almost.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.215
Dr. Penguin, there's gotta
be something you can do.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.385
All right. Let's commence
the un-hypnotizing.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.922
It's a very delicate procedure.
I'll need total silence.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.558
Snap out of it!
<i> Snap out of it!</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
Patty-cake, Roger!

09:55.562 --> 09:57.963
BOTH (chanting):
¶ My mother, your mother
lived across the street ¶

09:57.965 --> 10:00.131
¶ 1-8-1-9 Blueberry Street ¶

10:00.133 --> 10:01.733
¶ Every night
they have a fight ¶

10:01.735 --> 10:04.035
¶ This is what they said
that night ¶

10:04.037 --> 10:05.904
¶ Boys go to Jupiter,
get more stupider ¶

10:05.906 --> 10:07.973
¶ Girls go to Mars
to be superstars ¶

10:07.975 --> 10:09.741
¶ Rumble, tumble,
strawberry shake ¶

10:09.743 --> 10:11.042
Freeze!

10:11.044 --> 10:13.278
(both laugh)

10:13.280 --> 10:17.048
Ah, childhood.
Such a sweet, sexual time.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.750
Hey!
You didn't fix her.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.485
Sorry, Jeff, but Hayley
seems to be

10:20.487 --> 10:23.154
in what is known as
age regression lock.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.257
So she'll stay
a 6-year-old forever?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.893
Not forever, but, yes,
until she dies.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.162
That is, unless you find
her trigger.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.564
Wait. What --
what do you mean?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.266
Happy Hayley didn't stay
Happy Hayley.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.568
(lighter clicks)

10:36.570 --> 10:38.570
Something in her past
turned her

10:38.572 --> 10:40.472
into the cranky, preachy
downer Hayley

10:40.474 --> 10:42.440
that we all know
and you love.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.342
Finding that trigger
should bring her back.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.777
Enough
of this nonsense!

10:45.779 --> 10:47.779
I think it's time
for a family trip

10:47.781 --> 10:50.148
to the Cheesecake Warehouse!

10:50.150 --> 10:53.118
Yay! Yay, yay, yay, yay!
Buffalo bites!

10:53.120 --> 10:56.221
I'm in! I can smoke there
'cause it's gross.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.759
Ugh. I need to find
Hayley's trigger.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.993
I will help.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.695
Yuck.
Klaus?

11:03.697 --> 11:06.998
I've been hiding all week
from that 6-year-old asshole.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.501
(birds chirping)

11:10.837 --> 11:13.405
Whoa, look,
her 7th birthday party.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.481
Oh, look how sad she is,

11:23.483 --> 11:27.185
like a single baby's shoe
floating down the river.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.695
Something at that party
made her stop smiling.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.798
That was it!
That was the moment

11:39.800 --> 11:42.000
she became downer Hayley!

11:42.002 --> 11:44.135
What is she looking at?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.137
There.
This boy behind Hayley

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
was taking a picture
at the same time.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.742
If he still has it, then we
can see what Hayley saw.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.311
Whoa, whoa,
one step at at time.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.747
First, we have to go
through this whole yearbook

11:55.749 --> 11:57.982
to try and find --
Oh, here he is. Joe chandler.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.318
He has a camera
in his school picture, too.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.520
Hmm. Bit of
a shutterbug, I suppose.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.756
Great detective work,
Klaus.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.758
Hey, we make
a pretty good team.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.227
Looks like this case
was made for...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.629
Fish and the Jeffman.

12:13.166 --> 12:19.003
(both humming
"Wheels and the Legman" theme)

12:19.005 --> 12:22.741
(humming continues)

12:25.445 --> 12:27.679
(brakes squeal)

12:27.681 --> 12:31.416
Damn it! Roger's suing us
for copyright infringement.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.085
He says this is like
"Wheels and the Legman."

12:34.087 --> 12:36.087
What?! In what way?!

12:36.089 --> 12:38.556
(bubbling)

12:38.558 --> 12:40.558
What are you boys doing?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.060
It's been a week, Steve.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.129
The meat's falling
off the bone!

12:44.131 --> 12:47.465
The bone! All that flavor
trapped in the bone.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.801
But what if we cook
the bone down to a jelly

12:49.803 --> 12:51.703
and then the jelly down
to a broth,

12:51.705 --> 12:53.605
and then the broth
down to a reduction?!

12:53.607 --> 12:56.975
You're playing God with pork!
Just let us eat!

12:56.977 --> 13:00.211
I knew you guys couldn't handle
the pressure of a slow cook.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.479
Luckily, I'm ready.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.414
Looks like you boys
brought hands

13:03.416 --> 13:04.916
to a crossbow fight.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.785
But I want food now!

13:06.787 --> 13:08.553
Barry, tide yourself over
with a --

13:08.555 --> 13:11.055
Don't you say it, Steve!
Don't you dare tell me

13:11.057 --> 13:13.391
to eat another
Nature's Harvest bar!

13:13.393 --> 13:16.461
I can't. My poops.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.898
(crying)
They're like drywall.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.834
You're asking if I have
a photo

13:22.836 --> 13:24.335
I took at
a birthday party

13:24.337 --> 13:25.804
that I went to
when I was 7?

13:25.806 --> 13:27.672
We know it's a long shot,
Mr. Chandler,

13:27.674 --> 13:29.674
but my wife's life
depends on it.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.843
Oh, yeah.
I remember her.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.612
I can't make any promises,
but I'll go have a look.

13:34.614 --> 13:38.483
How am I supposed to find
one picture...

13:38.485 --> 13:42.520
From the thousands and thousands
I've taken of her?

13:42.522 --> 13:45.023
Thank God I digitized them all.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.259
Joe Chandler,
you perfectly sane genius.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.694
There it is.
(mouse clicks)

13:49.696 --> 13:53.798
(printer whirring)

13:53.800 --> 13:56.167
Boop. And one for me.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.037
(mouse clicks,
printer whirring)

14:00.841 --> 14:04.642
Mmm. Mmm...mmm.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.444
Well, looks like
we're in luck.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.712
I found the picture.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.181
Oh, that's amazing!
Thanks, Joe.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.684
Now, would I be imposing
if I asked you

14:12.686 --> 14:14.519
to put a camera
in your pee hole?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.787
What?

14:15.789 --> 14:17.088
Boop.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.793
Klaus, look.
Look where she's pointing.

14:21.795 --> 14:24.729
Oh, a big man clubbing
a baby seal?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.497
That is not fair.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.066
That's it, Klaus!

14:28.068 --> 14:30.668
This is the moment she realized
life wasn't fair.

14:30.670 --> 14:31.903
That's her trigger.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.504
Then we need
to recreate it.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.473
That will snap her out
of the deep trance.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.008
Let's go.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.478
KLAUS: That Joe Chandler was
a cool dude.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.547
Next time...

14:42.549 --> 14:44.649
Next time I'll have bullets.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.354
(crickets chirping)

14:49.356 --> 14:51.990
(lowered voice) Jeff,
I love the symmetry of this.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.892
Seeing a seal clubbed
to death

14:53.894 --> 14:56.027
is what broke happy Hayley
the first time,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.997
and doing it again
will break her once more.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.499
Klaus, we're not gonna
club a seal to death.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.668
You're right. It doesn't
have to be a seal.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.403
Just anything innocent.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.407
The important thing
is the club...and the death.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.511
No, 'cause that's what turned
her into frowny-faced Hayley.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.347
If we can just show her that
the world is unfair to animals

15:16.349 --> 15:19.417
without murdering one, then
maybe she'll snap out of it,

15:19.419 --> 15:22.620
but keep a little bit
of happy Hayley inside.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.789
Oh,<i> sucks.</i>

15:24.791 --> 15:26.457
I thought we were
on the same page

15:26.459 --> 15:28.159
the whole drive.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.430
Why are we
at the fish zoo?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.132
Oh, just for fun.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.968
Hey, look at
the pretty seals!

15:36.970 --> 15:38.703
Wait a minute.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.439
That's an awfully small place
for a seal to live.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.375
It's not fair.
Right, Klaus?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.810
Oh, yeah.

15:45.812 --> 15:49.747
Look at these poor,
sweet, gentle creatures.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.217
The lambs of the sea,
stuck their whole lives

15:53.219 --> 15:55.053
in a tiny...

15:55.055 --> 15:56.788
There's one behind me,
isn't there?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.723
And is it, like,
exactly the opposite

15:58.725 --> 16:00.124
of how I described them?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.393
(growls)
Aah!

16:02.395 --> 16:05.229
Klaus!
Aah! Help me!

16:05.231 --> 16:06.464
Hold on!

16:06.466 --> 16:09.067
Ohh! (panting)

16:09.069 --> 16:11.336
In your face, seal.
You can't get me.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.637
(growls)
Aah!

16:12.639 --> 16:14.639
Seals can come on land?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.108
I thought they had to stay
in the water like fish!

16:17.110 --> 16:19.811
Oh, no. (gasps)

16:19.813 --> 16:23.448
Evolve, Klaus. (gasps)
Evolve like the wind!

16:23.450 --> 16:26.117
(grunts) Ow! Aah!

16:26.119 --> 16:28.686
(growls)
Hey! (grunts)

16:28.688 --> 16:32.757
(growling)

16:32.759 --> 16:36.327
(barking)
Stay...away...from Klaus!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.429
(panting)

16:38.431 --> 16:41.132
Ooh! You killed it.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.800
I want a mermaid key chain!

16:42.802 --> 16:45.303
Oh, good, she didn't see me
kill the seal.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.504
(click)

16:46.506 --> 16:48.339
But<i> we</i> did.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.174
(timer dings)

16:50.176 --> 16:53.011
We did it, friends.
We cooked the perfect pork.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.414
Wish you could try it,
but you're all dead.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.222
(screaming)

17:04.224 --> 17:07.825
(gasps) Oh, God!

17:07.827 --> 17:10.528
The meaning of the dream
is so clear!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.898
I gotta share this pork
with my friends immediately!

17:13.900 --> 17:17.502
Oh, come on. Every morning?
Didn't you hear me?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.470
There's no time. I need
to do the right thing

17:19.472 --> 17:21.005
for my friends.

17:21.007 --> 17:24.242
You should be
in that slow cooker, you pig.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.080
(remote control clicks)

17:30.350 --> 17:32.550
I know that's hard
to watch.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.086
That's why I only showed it
to you 10 times.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.822
Jeff Fischer broke
into the aquarium

17:37.824 --> 17:41.526
and brutally killed a seal,
but not just any seal.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.027
This was Harpy...

17:43.029 --> 17:44.829
(remote control clicks)
...the cutest seal.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.064
JURY: Aw.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.432
I can't hear you!

17:47.434 --> 17:49.100
JURY (louder): Aw!

17:49.102 --> 17:52.103
The prosecution rests,
but not before a quick round

17:52.105 --> 17:54.705
of high five
with this awesome jury!

17:54.707 --> 17:58.509
(cheers and applause,
upbeat theme music playing)

17:59.879 --> 18:01.679
What's happening, daddy?

18:01.681 --> 18:05.083
That man is on trial because
he did a bad thing to a seal.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.952
I like seals.
I don't like that man.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.887
No one does.
(gavel bangs)

18:09.889 --> 18:12.223
So, does the defendant
want to waste our time

18:12.225 --> 18:13.791
before the jury
finds him guilty?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.094
We'd like to call
Dr. Penguin to the stand.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.728
Huh?
Who's Dr. Penguin?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.197
That'd be me.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.365
I can explain why Jeff
did what he did,

18:21.367 --> 18:25.103
or if I may hypnotize
the jury, your honor?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.971
Oh, fun! I'll allow it.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.809
Jeff Fischer is not guilty.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.246
Not guilty. With every swing
of the watch,

18:35.248 --> 18:39.150
you'll find Jeff
a little less guilty.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.986
We find the defendant
not guilty.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.488
Okay, cool.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.556
Jeff Fischer, you're free to go.
(gavel bangs)

18:45.558 --> 18:47.125
Yes!
(gallery shouting at once)

18:47.127 --> 18:48.626
Daddy, what's wrong?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.962
The man who killed the seal
is being let go.

18:50.964 --> 18:54.398
What?! But that's not fair!
That's not fair.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.801
That's not fair.
(gruff voice) That's not fair.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.069
(clears throat)

18:58.071 --> 18:59.403
(normal voice)
That's not fair.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.073
Oh. Whoa.
Where the hell am I?

19:02.075 --> 19:03.574
Ugh. Hayley's back.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.843
Hayley! I've missed you
so much.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.079
Missed me?
But where have I been?

19:08.081 --> 19:10.948
The real question is
<i> when</i> have you been?

19:10.950 --> 19:13.451
(laughter)

19:13.453 --> 19:15.953
Seriously, guys, I can't account
for a lot of time,

19:15.955 --> 19:17.622
and I'm kind of freaking out.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.757
Will someone please explain
what's happening?

19:19.759 --> 19:22.360
More like,<i> who's</i> happening,
right, guys?

19:22.362 --> 19:25.997
(laughter)

19:25.999 --> 19:27.832
(crickets chirping)

19:27.834 --> 19:29.967
Guys, I'm sorry I got
carried away

19:29.969 --> 19:31.669
with the slow cooker,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.671
but my pursuit of perfection
was not totally in vain,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.306
'cause like the pork,

19:35.308 --> 19:37.542
our friendship has been
simmered to perfection.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.110
Let's eat!

19:39.112 --> 19:41.512
Mmm. Mmm.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.880
Divine.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.352
Yet it leaves
something behind.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.987
Metallic, maybe?

19:49.989 --> 19:53.157
Furry.
Almost moving?

19:53.159 --> 19:56.494
With perhaps
maggoty undertones?

19:56.496 --> 19:59.297
(siren wailing)

19:59.299 --> 20:00.798
Who gave you
the stupid idea

20:00.800 --> 20:03.501
you could eat
12-day-old pork?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.136
He did!

20:06.906 --> 20:08.873
(snorting)

20:08.875 --> 20:12.243
He's pigs! He's pigs!

20:12.245 --> 20:14.645
(grunts)
I gotta restrain this one.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.381
He's on to us.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.350
This isn't an ambulance!

20:19.352 --> 20:21.886
It's a goddamn hambulance!

20:21.888 --> 20:23.754
<i> (snorting alarm wailing)</i>

20:23.756 --> 20:25.389
(gasping)

20:25.391 --> 20:27.592
Pigs. Pigs everywhere.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.227
They're all pigs.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.928
I think Steve ate
a lot more than us.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.263
(grunting)

20:34.701 --> 20:37.001
Thanks for looking out
for me, Jeff.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.502
I'm glad to be back
to my old self,

20:38.504 --> 20:41.105
even if happy Hayley
is gone for good.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.841
It's all right, babe.
I love you no matter what.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.910
Hey, wanna grab a bite
before the P.E.T.A. protest?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.878
Sure. For some reason,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.348
I could go for a scoop
of mint chip.

20:50.350 --> 20:54.585
Hey! You're smiling, babe.
That's one for the scrapbook.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.722
(camera shutter clicks,
whirs)

20:57.724 --> 21:00.024
(whispers) I hate this part.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye! Have a beautiful time!

21:06.199 --> 21:08.032
