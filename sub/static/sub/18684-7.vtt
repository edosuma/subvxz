00:08.173 --> 00:10.241
How many people
do you think are kidnapped

00:10.243 --> 00:11.543
in your average year?

00:11.851 --> 00:16.714
It's around 300,000,
and in 95% of those cases,

00:16.716 --> 00:18.983
it's never reported to the police.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.418
This is where Crisis Resolution
comes into play.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.687
We operate in the shadows...
a dark place

00:23.689 --> 00:27.992
where dialing 911 could get
your nearest and dearest killed.

00:27.994 --> 00:31.729
Our mandate is to save lives
without the use of violence.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.097
Now, since the people we deal with

00:33.099 --> 00:37.067
often don't subscribe
to that particular mandate,

00:37.069 --> 00:38.969
it is no walk in the park.

00:38.971 --> 00:39.942
So how do we do it?

00:39.944 --> 00:44.575
Well, it boils down
to objective versus stakes.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.777
Now, this is really just
a fancy way of saying

00:46.779 --> 00:49.179
want versus need.

00:49.181 --> 00:51.949
Now, you guys are scientists,
you're epidemiologists,

00:51.951 --> 00:53.217
so your want might be

00:53.219 --> 00:56.320
to cure some unpronounceable,
incurable disease.

00:57.282 --> 01:01.592
But your need is to feel like
you are making a difference.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.085
Now, a kidnapper may say

01:03.110 --> 01:04.762
that they want $6 million,

01:04.763 --> 01:06.897
but what they need is to provide

01:06.899 --> 01:09.474
for some critically ill loved one.

01:10.036 --> 01:13.768
Now, if I can identify
and satisfy that need,

01:14.607 --> 01:17.074
a hostage comes home safely.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.343
Thank you.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.678
Thank you very much.

01:22.982 --> 01:24.648
Mr. Beaumont.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.750
Quite inspirational.

01:26.752 --> 01:30.721
A welcome change from discussing
the vectors for Zika and Ebola.

01:30.723 --> 01:31.955
Thank you, Dr. Wallace.

01:31.957 --> 01:34.291
Happy to provide a diversion
from the serious stuff.

01:34.293 --> 01:36.590
Well, managing scientists
is like herding cats.

01:36.592 --> 01:38.262
You gave me some good points.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.681
- Can I get you a drink?
- Beer would be perfect.

01:43.769 --> 01:46.103
So, you hand over money to kidnappers?

01:47.173 --> 01:48.672
Sometimes.

01:48.674 --> 01:51.539
So, because of you,
kidnappers keep kidnapping?

01:51.541 --> 01:53.410
I mean, you help them make money, right?

01:53.412 --> 01:55.212
Well, not all kidnapping is about money.

01:55.214 --> 01:57.281
Sometimes people
just want to make a point.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.099
Well, if there was no money in it,

01:59.585 --> 02:02.052
you know, basically,
it would just stop, right?

02:02.054 --> 02:03.087
Cameron.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.254
No, you may have a point.

02:04.256 --> 02:06.190
I mean, if no one paid,

02:06.192 --> 02:07.691
if we stopped negotiating altogether,

02:07.693 --> 02:09.493
then kidnapping might subside...

02:09.495 --> 02:11.187
for a while.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.997
Problem is, it would take time

02:13.999 --> 02:15.299
for the kidnappers to get the message,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.868
so you'd have to accept
the deaths of thousands

02:17.870 --> 02:20.070
just to test your hypothesis.

02:20.072 --> 02:22.188
Would you be willing to do that?

02:22.442 --> 02:24.308
Sacrifice for the greater good.

02:24.443 --> 02:26.558
Sometimes you have to.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.281
Anyway, it's all irrelevant.

02:33.285 --> 02:35.219
I am so sorry, Mr. Beaumont.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.787
Don't be.
I have a teenager of my own.

02:37.923 --> 02:40.357
Alexis Tremblay,
research director at the NEC.

02:40.359 --> 02:41.925
A pleasure. Excuse me.

02:41.927 --> 02:44.027
I can't seem to get through
to my son at all these days.

02:44.029 --> 02:45.796
My daughter has her moments, too.

02:47.099 --> 02:49.600
To be honest, it surprised me
when Cameron asked to come.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.636
He's never shown any interest
in my research.

02:52.638 --> 02:54.905
I don't know. I think
I can see why he came.

02:54.907 --> 02:55.939
He found a friend.

02:55.941 --> 02:57.374
That must be a grad student.

02:57.376 --> 02:59.410
I noticed a few of them here.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.844
Right.

03:00.846 --> 03:02.513
- Your beer.
- Thank you, sir.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.883
I hate to break up the party,
but we've a plane to catch.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.590
CEO kidnapped in Tunisia.

03:09.528 --> 03:11.522
Okay, well, duty calls.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.656
Another time, perhaps.

03:12.658 --> 03:13.557
Sure.

03:13.559 --> 03:14.792
Thank you.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.009 --> 03:31.308
Sorry I had to drag you away

03:31.310 --> 03:32.810
from your adoring fans back there.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.812
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.048
You know they loved your talk.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.110
Aren't they pretty.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.733
Time to change the world.

03:58.904 --> 04:04.208
Have you ever...
used your technique to, um...

04:05.109 --> 04:07.578
influence a lady?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.056
Before you were married, of course.

04:09.058 --> 04:10.481
That'd be unethical.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.183
That doesn't answer my question.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.231
- Was that...
- Sounds like.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.899
Automatic weapons, multiple shooters.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.133
All right, return to the mainland.

04:30.135 --> 04:31.902
Alert the police. Call Oliver and Zara.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.837
Eric, you have no idea
what's going on in there.

04:33.839 --> 04:34.805
So I'm gonna go find out.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.373
I need you to get back and run point.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.808
Me? I'm not leaving you.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.443
Get to the boat. Wait there.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.236
I'll get a situation report.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.016
Everybody on the ground!

04:46.018 --> 04:47.885
On the ground... now!

04:47.887 --> 04:50.053
- On the ground now!
- Get down!

04:53.659 --> 04:54.658
Go on, by the window!

04:54.660 --> 04:57.628
Down on the ground, right now!

04:57.630 --> 04:59.663
- Get back down!
- Stay down!

05:07.106 --> 05:08.939
Bad news, people.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.474
Bar's closed.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.409
Come on.

05:12.411 --> 05:14.811
Heads down!

05:22.087 --> 05:23.687
Get down!

05:34.567 --> 05:36.466
How fast can this thing go?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.119
Inside.

06:07.688 --> 06:15.688
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

06:21.192 --> 06:22.691
Am I pleased to see you.

06:22.693 --> 06:24.226
What happened?

06:24.228 --> 06:25.995
I didn't split on Eric.

06:25.997 --> 06:27.329
He made me leave him on the island.

06:27.331 --> 06:28.898
We know that, Max. Are you okay?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.032
Yeah.

06:30.034 --> 06:31.734
Do the hostage takers know
you got off the island?

06:31.736 --> 06:33.636
They took the building
just as we were leaving.

06:33.638 --> 06:35.771
It was an unchartered boat,
so I'm pretty sure they don't.

06:35.773 --> 06:37.640
So as far as they're concerned,
no one outside the island

06:37.642 --> 06:39.075
even knows there's a hostage-taking.

06:39.077 --> 06:41.477
Yeah. I... I spoke to the OPP commander.

06:41.479 --> 06:43.412
He's a fan of Eric's,
knows what he does.

06:43.414 --> 06:45.214
He's agreed to keep it quiet... for now.

06:45.216 --> 06:46.215
Good.

06:46.217 --> 06:48.117
Any indication as to motive?

06:48.119 --> 06:50.252
All Eric said was that
there was 8 to 10 of them

06:50.254 --> 06:52.321
and they're all young.

06:57.028 --> 06:59.895
So, there it is... an island.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.998
Impossible to approach
without being detected.

07:04.502 --> 07:05.534
Who are you calling?

07:05.536 --> 07:08.070
Saunders. We need a negotiator.

07:08.072 --> 07:09.205
He can be here in 45 minutes.

07:09.207 --> 07:11.307
<i>Eric said I should
take the lead on this.</i>

07:11.804 --> 07:12.975
He did?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.580
<i>She is his second.</i>

07:17.582 --> 07:19.849
When do I stop being a newbie?

07:23.321 --> 07:24.854
Lead the way.

07:32.797 --> 07:35.097
We're gonna be passing around some bags.

07:35.099 --> 07:37.633
Place your belongings
and cellphones inside.

07:37.635 --> 07:38.834
Don't be shy.

07:38.836 --> 07:40.269
And don't worry.

07:40.271 --> 07:41.971
It's not like you'll be needing them.

07:44.008 --> 07:46.093
I want to be with my son.

07:47.044 --> 07:48.878
- Excuse me.
- Shut up!

07:48.880 --> 07:51.213
We need to stay calm.
Your son's okay where he is.

07:51.215 --> 07:52.478
The less we antagonize them, the better.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.217
Mom. I'm okay.

07:58.556 --> 08:01.557
These aren't rich people
you're stealing from.

08:01.559 --> 08:04.793
This is a conference
for scientists and researchers.

08:04.795 --> 08:06.428
He's boring me.

08:13.538 --> 08:16.181
Here. Take mine.

08:16.774 --> 08:18.736
Everybody do as he asks.

08:19.443 --> 08:22.378
You see? His speech wasn't just talk.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.714
The art of negotiation actually works.

08:25.716 --> 08:27.816
You give me what I want,

08:27.818 --> 08:30.386
I'll let you live a short while longer.

08:30.388 --> 08:32.254
We have a deal?

08:32.256 --> 08:34.890
My drops... I need them.

08:34.892 --> 08:37.793
This is what you do, right?
Handle situations like this?

08:37.794 --> 08:39.195
Normally, from the outside.

08:39.197 --> 08:41.030
But yeah, it's not my first rodeo.

08:41.032 --> 08:42.898
Does that mean you know
how to get us out of here?

08:42.900 --> 08:44.667
Please tell me you do.

08:44.669 --> 08:46.135
I'll find out what they want

08:47.073 --> 08:49.038
and give them what they need.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.640
Is it money that they want?

08:51.642 --> 08:54.543
They've gone to an awful lot
of trouble for a robbery.

08:54.545 --> 08:56.812
I need to contact my team.

08:57.815 --> 09:00.115
But you just gave up your phone.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.586
Yeah, that's right.

09:10.528 --> 09:13.095
What do they want?

09:18.736 --> 09:20.669
Commander Corman?

09:20.671 --> 09:22.705
This is Zara Hallam, investigator,

09:22.707 --> 09:25.207
and Oliver Yates,
psychological profiler.

09:25.209 --> 09:27.109
Beaumont's team. Glad you're here.

09:27.111 --> 09:29.945
Have you had any contact
with the hostage takers?

09:29.947 --> 09:30.846
None.

09:30.848 --> 09:32.014
And we've kept out of sight

09:32.016 --> 09:33.549
while we go over assault scenarios.

09:33.551 --> 09:35.217
There's no angle
we can approach the island

09:35.219 --> 09:37.152
without sending a five-minute
warning we're coming.

09:37.154 --> 09:38.621
And even if we manage to hit land,

09:38.623 --> 09:41.390
the building itself is a rabbit warren.

09:41.392 --> 09:43.092
Clearing it room by room,
all potentially

09:43.094 --> 09:44.793
rigged with traps,
it's gonna take some time.

09:44.795 --> 09:47.263
Well, all the more reason
to attempt negotiations first.

09:47.265 --> 09:49.431
I'll have to clear that
with the commissioner.

09:49.433 --> 09:51.767
Having Eric on the inside
could be useful,

09:51.769 --> 09:53.736
but no contact from the assailants

09:53.738 --> 09:56.338
suggests they're not exactly
the negotiating type.

09:57.275 --> 09:58.941
What would your first move be?

10:01.045 --> 10:05.214
We need to identify and profile
the hostage takers.

10:05.216 --> 10:07.750
It's essential to understanding
who we're negotiating with.

10:07.752 --> 10:10.352
We gather the hostage takers
were in the audience with Eric.

10:10.354 --> 10:12.254
Which means they would've
needed conference IDs

10:12.256 --> 10:13.355
to get past security.

10:13.357 --> 10:15.758
Can you access the conference database?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.559
We're looking for 8 to 10 people,

10:17.561 --> 10:18.861
all in their early 20s.

10:18.863 --> 10:20.663
Okay. We'll share our I.T.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.298
I'll check with HQ for anything more.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.265
Thank you.

10:23.267 --> 10:24.633
I'll get started on the VEB.

10:24.635 --> 10:25.968
I'll be right there.

10:28.906 --> 10:30.873
You're doing fine, Max.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.175
Just don't forget to breathe.

10:48.326 --> 10:49.692
Where the hell are you going?

10:49.694 --> 10:50.793
I want to help your boss.

10:50.795 --> 10:52.061
Sit down.

10:52.063 --> 10:53.262
Whoa!

10:53.681 --> 10:55.964
Let the negotiator through.

10:55.966 --> 10:58.033
I want to see him work his magic on me.

11:00.338 --> 11:03.439
My cellphone is in that bag over there.

11:03.441 --> 11:06.297
And in four minutes,
my team is going to call.

11:06.844 --> 11:08.744
I see.

11:08.746 --> 11:10.846
This is the part where
you identify some common ground

11:10.848 --> 11:12.381
to build rapport between us.

11:12.383 --> 11:14.049
If I don't answer when it rings,

11:14.051 --> 11:15.551
my team will assume something's wrong

11:15.553 --> 11:17.019
and take action.

11:18.756 --> 11:20.389
What kind of action?

11:20.391 --> 11:22.624
Police action.

11:23.794 --> 11:25.661
I'm presuming a bunch of cops
coming across the water

11:25.663 --> 11:28.564
isn't gonna help you achieve whatever
it is you're trying to do here.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.433
Well, if I let you answer the phone,

11:31.435 --> 11:32.835
you might say something stupid.

11:32.837 --> 11:35.437
In which case, you'd shoot me,
like those guards back there.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.041
Your only way of keeping the police away

11:39.043 --> 11:41.176
is by letting me answer.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.513
You're good.

11:44.515 --> 11:47.116
He is very good.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.953
All right, bring me the damn phones.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.593
You know what, old man?

11:57.595 --> 12:00.028
I kind of hope
you do say something stupid.

12:04.969 --> 12:07.836
Okay, so, we got
eight registered attendees

12:07.838 --> 12:09.972
between the ages of 19 and 23.

12:09.974 --> 12:13.342
All submitted false names,
none with any ties to the NEC.

12:13.344 --> 12:16.745
So eight hostage takers
who got credentialed somehow.

12:16.747 --> 12:18.013
Criminal records?

12:18.015 --> 12:19.214
Doesn't look like it,

12:19.216 --> 12:22.918
but these four all have
a history of activism...

12:22.920 --> 12:24.520
environmental, anti-animal testing,

12:24.522 --> 12:26.021
some pretty extreme left politics.

12:26.023 --> 12:29.057
The National Epidemic Center is
renowned for discovering cures

12:29.059 --> 12:31.560
for some of the most dangerous
diseases out there.

12:31.562 --> 12:34.062
What kind of activist would
have a problem with that?

12:34.064 --> 12:36.632
Okay, commissioner's patient to a point.

12:36.634 --> 12:38.867
She's willing to see if Beaumont
can set up a negotiation,

12:38.869 --> 12:40.169
but it's got to be fast.

12:40.171 --> 12:41.870
Okay, good. Thank you, Commander.

12:41.872 --> 12:44.640
We've ID'd some of the hostage takers.

12:44.642 --> 12:46.175
Seems they're activists,

12:46.177 --> 12:48.710
suggesting an environmental motive.

12:48.712 --> 12:50.112
Send everything you've got to my people,

12:50.114 --> 12:52.514
and we'll run it through
our CPIC database.

12:52.516 --> 12:55.317
How long ago
did Eric send you that text?

12:56.987 --> 12:58.821
1 hour, 58 minutes ago.

12:58.823 --> 13:00.222
T-minus two minutes.

13:01.158 --> 13:03.192
Protocol.

13:03.194 --> 13:05.360
For when a team member is taken hostage.

13:05.362 --> 13:06.962
We make a prearranged call.

13:06.964 --> 13:08.797
I'll inform the commander.

13:11.535 --> 13:16.939
Saunders is a good first,
and he also knows protocol.

13:17.595 --> 13:19.708
You really think she's got this?

13:19.710 --> 13:21.308
She'd better.

13:22.046 --> 13:24.437
Eric's bet his life on it.

13:28.052 --> 13:30.319
Maybe they're not gonna call.

13:34.559 --> 13:37.077
Ring, for God's sakes.

13:42.199 --> 13:43.565
This is fun.

13:55.679 --> 13:57.446
Speaker.

13:57.448 --> 13:59.681
And if I hear any word
that I don't like...

14:02.486 --> 14:03.919
Eric speaking.

14:03.921 --> 14:05.787
Eric, this is Maxine Carlson

14:05.789 --> 14:08.323
<i>from the Crisis Resolution head office.</i>

14:08.325 --> 14:09.825
Hey, Maxine.

14:09.827 --> 14:12.594
I think I was late
with my last check-in, wasn't I?

14:12.596 --> 14:14.096
<i>That's right... you were.</i>

14:14.098 --> 14:17.566
<i>We were just about to activate
our rescue protocols.</i>

14:17.568 --> 14:18.800
Well, the good news is, I'm fine.

14:18.802 --> 14:19.935
You don't need to come get me.

14:19.937 --> 14:21.770
<i>I know I'm expected on a plane to Tunis,</i>

14:21.772 --> 14:24.907
but, the damn traffic
en route to the airport

14:24.909 --> 14:27.509
is impossible, so I'm gonna
need time to find another way.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.177
That's enough.

14:31.248 --> 14:32.514
Did he just hang up on us?

14:32.516 --> 14:34.516
<i>Someone hung up for him.</i>

14:37.555 --> 14:40.906
<i>Damn traffic en route
to the airport is impossible.</i>

14:42.293 --> 14:43.725
What does that mean?

14:43.727 --> 14:46.361
Traffic en route is impossible.

14:46.363 --> 14:50.365
Okay, first port of call
is establish decision maker.

14:50.794 --> 14:53.402
He's saying negotiating with the leader

14:53.404 --> 14:54.903
is gonna be impossible.

14:54.905 --> 14:57.372
<i>I'm gonna need time to find another way.</i>

14:57.374 --> 14:59.541
Find another way...

14:59.543 --> 15:01.510
Someone else.

15:01.512 --> 15:04.613
<i>He needs time to find someone
else he can negotiate with.</i>

15:04.615 --> 15:06.081
<i>Well, the good news is, I'm fine.</i>

15:06.083 --> 15:07.616
<i>You don't need to come get me.</i>

15:07.618 --> 15:09.885
He wants us to keep the police
from storming in there.

15:09.887 --> 15:12.054
Then let's hope he gets
someone talking to us pronto.

15:12.056 --> 15:14.656
The OPP won't hold off for long.

15:15.859 --> 15:17.273
Let's go.

15:18.729 --> 15:19.962
You see?

15:19.964 --> 15:21.630
He is smart.

15:21.632 --> 15:24.600
He proved that he's worthy of my trust.

15:24.602 --> 15:25.801
Did you listen to the part of my talk

15:25.803 --> 15:28.737
where I said I would
do anything, say, help anyone

15:28.739 --> 15:30.272
if it would save lives?

15:30.274 --> 15:32.055
I already knew that.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.681
I read about you when I knew
you were gonna be here.

15:34.812 --> 15:36.378
Pretty impressive.

15:37.715 --> 15:38.780
Honestly, not that impressive.

15:38.782 --> 15:40.482
What I'm saying is, I can help you.

15:40.484 --> 15:42.751
It's too late for that, old man.

15:43.687 --> 15:45.854
Look at the world around you.

15:45.856 --> 15:47.723
Terrorism, poverty,

15:47.725 --> 15:50.592
water rising, wildlife dying.

15:50.594 --> 15:52.995
Where were you then?

15:52.997 --> 15:54.635
Where have you been?

15:54.660 --> 15:56.493
All of you!

16:00.998 --> 16:02.331
Finally.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.708
All right. Take him.

16:08.178 --> 16:09.945
Take me?

16:09.947 --> 16:12.347
- Take... Where?!
- Don't worry.

16:12.349 --> 16:13.915
- It'll be quick and painless.
- Let me... Let me go in his place.

16:13.917 --> 16:15.817
- Don't worry!
- Where are you taking me?!

16:15.819 --> 16:16.885
You want to be brave,

16:16.887 --> 16:18.820
but what you need to do is shut up.

16:28.637 --> 16:30.303
They're going to kill Dr. Wallace.

16:30.305 --> 16:31.438
I don't think so.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.739
Why not?

16:32.741 --> 16:36.176
The guy in charge wouldn't
hesitate to kill in front of us.

16:36.178 --> 16:38.044
He's looking for something.

16:40.949 --> 16:44.017
Max. Oliver thinks
he's identified the leader.

16:48.056 --> 16:51.958
Lucas Hansen...
not your typical hostage taker.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.593
Impressive GPA.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.096
Graduate degree in poli sci at 22.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.465
Donated half his scholarship
to a cancer charity.

16:58.467 --> 17:01.301
Spent two months de-oiling birds

17:01.303 --> 17:03.503
after a tanker broke up in Puget Sound.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.338
And if that didn't
qualify him for sainthood,

17:05.339 --> 17:07.773
he also volunteered
at a shelter for runaway youth.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.509
De-oiling birds?

17:09.511 --> 17:10.710
What a monster.

17:10.712 --> 17:12.646
What makes you think
he's calling the shots?

17:12.647 --> 17:15.714
12 years ago, a pipeline burst
in his hometown.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.651
Water supply was contaminated.

17:17.653 --> 17:20.787
Both his father and younger
brother died of lymphoma

17:20.789 --> 17:22.288
within five years.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.957
No charges were ever laid.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.792
Government deemed the accident
unpreventable.

17:26.795 --> 17:30.263
Personal trauma mixed with
an ideological disposition...

17:30.265 --> 17:32.699
The profile associated
with stochastic terrorism.

17:32.701 --> 17:35.168
Lone wolves not engaged
in organized extremism.

17:35.170 --> 17:38.104
The Tsarnaev brothers,
the San Bernardino killers.

17:38.106 --> 17:39.806
So Eric is right.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.409
He's an ideologue
who will not negotiate.

17:42.411 --> 17:43.576
That's it. We got to go in.

17:43.578 --> 17:45.338
- No, not... not yet, Commander.
- Then what?

17:47.115 --> 17:48.248
Excuse me.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.916
It's the commissioner.

17:50.752 --> 17:52.852
Saved by the bell.

17:54.322 --> 17:56.222
What are you gonna do?

17:56.224 --> 17:58.191
Eric is counterintuitive.

17:58.193 --> 18:01.127
He succeeds because
he doesn't do the obvious.

18:02.464 --> 18:03.730
Maybe I was wrong all along.

18:03.732 --> 18:05.265
I just assumed the hostage takers

18:05.267 --> 18:06.433
should remain in the dark,

18:06.435 --> 18:09.135
but maybe they need to know
we're onto them.

18:16.344 --> 18:19.079
You were right. He's okay.

18:20.949 --> 18:22.048
You're next.

18:22.050 --> 18:23.283
Get up!

18:23.285 --> 18:24.951
What are they doing?

18:24.953 --> 18:27.220
Yeah, I'm gonna see what I can find out.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.065
Here you go.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.100
I'm not thirsty.

18:40.102 --> 18:41.067
Yes, you are.

18:41.069 --> 18:42.702
What happened in there?

18:42.704 --> 18:45.505
They searched me, emptied my pockets.

18:45.507 --> 18:46.940
Took a photograph.

18:46.942 --> 18:48.108
Photograph?

18:48.110 --> 18:50.777
Close-up of my face...
some kind of special camera.

18:50.779 --> 18:51.845
Special how?

18:51.847 --> 18:54.614
Get back to your seats.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.985
Hostage-taking 101.

18:58.987 --> 19:01.221
Keep your hostages hydrated.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.498
I need to know everything
your organization does.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.633
Leave nothing out.

19:13.635 --> 19:16.569
You said remaining out of sight
gave us a significant advantage,

19:16.571 --> 19:18.004
and now you want to do
the complete opposite?

19:18.006 --> 19:20.774
Yes... sirens, boats, choppers, even.

19:20.776 --> 19:22.275
The more visible the police presence,

19:22.277 --> 19:24.244
the more pressure it puts
on the hostage takers.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.413
Eric will use that pressure
to force a negotiation.

19:27.415 --> 19:30.400
You also said this was an
ideologue who won't negotiate.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.520
I got to be honest here...
Your back-and-forthing

19:33.522 --> 19:35.789
isn't exactly flooding me
with confidence in your ability.

19:35.791 --> 19:39.692
Look, we need to buy Eric time
so he can negotiate, Commander.

19:39.694 --> 19:40.994
Negotiate with whom?

19:40.996 --> 19:43.563
That's exactly what he'll be
working on as we speak.

19:43.565 --> 19:46.666
This show of force
will give him leverage.

19:47.803 --> 19:50.703
Okay. I'll give you your show of force.

19:50.705 --> 19:52.639
But I hope you know what you're doing.

19:56.340 --> 19:57.777
The National Epidemic Center

19:57.779 --> 20:00.380
is about curing infectious diseases.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.108
Anything off-book? High-stakes?

20:04.160 --> 20:06.386
We handle a lot of Level 4 material.

20:06.388 --> 20:08.655
Level 4? What is that?

20:08.657 --> 20:10.990
Reserved for the most dangerous...

20:10.992 --> 20:13.793
aerosol-transmitted, fatal to humans.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.663
Any Level 4 samples ever gone missing?

20:18.033 --> 20:20.834
A sample was stolen
during a break-in at our archive

20:20.836 --> 20:22.435
four months ago.

20:22.769 --> 20:24.571
A sample of what?

20:24.573 --> 20:26.606
No one knows for sure.

20:26.608 --> 20:29.542
RCMP, Homeland Security
both investigated.

20:29.544 --> 20:32.045
Whoever took it covered their tracks.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.482
You think it's connected.

20:40.488 --> 20:41.754
What is that?

20:43.625 --> 20:46.459
The police. They're rescuing us.

20:46.461 --> 20:49.229
No, that's not what this is.

20:49.231 --> 20:51.397
Get them to the basement... now.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.933
Everybody, downstairs!
Let's go! Let's go!

21:06.114 --> 21:07.347
They found us.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.650
Check the scanners.
Find out what they're planning.

21:24.299 --> 21:25.952
Gutsy move.

21:26.835 --> 21:28.434
Gutsy or crazy?

21:28.436 --> 21:31.204
You bet on Eric. I like those odds.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.306
Then where is he?

21:34.943 --> 21:37.516
Let's go! Move, move!

21:38.079 --> 21:39.779
Let me talk to your boss.

21:39.781 --> 21:41.547
Not happening. Move.

21:41.549 --> 21:43.449
The police launch an assault,
a lot of people get hurt...

21:43.451 --> 21:45.509
mainly you and your friends.

21:46.288 --> 21:48.521
I can stop this.

21:49.624 --> 21:51.491
Let's move! Let's move!

21:53.662 --> 21:55.295
Lucas.

21:57.532 --> 21:59.203
Clever man.

21:59.494 --> 22:02.135
That phone call... you ratted us out.

22:02.137 --> 22:04.037
You can't expect to lock down 100 people

22:04.039 --> 22:05.805
without someone getting the word out.

22:05.807 --> 22:07.507
What's important now
is that the police know,

22:07.509 --> 22:09.032
and you have to deal with that.

22:09.034 --> 22:10.721
I can tell you what to say.

22:11.146 --> 22:13.616
What are you gonna do
if the police storm the island?

22:14.349 --> 22:15.816
Start executing old people.

22:15.818 --> 22:18.532
Old people. Right.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.588
Now, you know that I will do
anything to avert loss of life.

22:22.590 --> 22:24.382
If that means convincing
the cops to back the hell off,

22:24.384 --> 22:26.159
then that's what I'll do.

22:27.909 --> 22:29.942
He's calling!

22:42.577 --> 22:44.711
Contact.

22:45.344 --> 22:46.644
<i>Maxine Carlson speaking.</i>

22:46.646 --> 22:48.012
Maxine again.

22:48.014 --> 22:49.079
Lucas.

22:49.081 --> 22:50.614
<i>The police have you surrounded.</i>

22:50.616 --> 22:51.849
Yeah, well, call them off

22:51.851 --> 22:54.218
or I'm gonna start putting
bullets in vital organs.

22:55.321 --> 22:57.988
If you want me to persuade
the police to abort,

22:58.380 --> 23:01.358
I'm gonna need to offer them
an incentive, Lucas.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.572
Let me guess... You want me
to release some hostages?

23:04.096 --> 23:05.763
You don't need all those people.

23:05.765 --> 23:08.132
<i>You're asking me to reduce my leverage.</i>

23:08.134 --> 23:10.000
How stupid do you think
I am, Ms. Carlson?

23:10.002 --> 23:11.769
I strongly advise you
to comply, Ms. Carlson.

23:11.771 --> 23:13.370
If you come breaking in here,
you'll spread terror

23:13.372 --> 23:14.905
and wind up killing who knows how many.

23:14.907 --> 23:16.307
That's enough.

23:18.644 --> 23:20.411
Eric's sending us another message.

23:20.413 --> 23:22.646
Okay, intonation rise and fall
was clear enough.

23:22.648 --> 23:24.748
Keywords... breaking in,
spread terror.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.250
"Wind up killing"

23:26.252 --> 23:27.484
Spread.

23:27.486 --> 23:29.820
This conference is
about infectious diseases.

23:29.822 --> 23:31.155
Infections spread.

23:31.157 --> 23:33.891
He's saying they're gonna use
a disease as a weapon.

23:33.893 --> 23:35.726
Okay, what about breaking in?

23:35.728 --> 23:38.562
Something stolen from the NEC?

23:38.564 --> 23:39.563
From the lab?

23:39.565 --> 23:41.324
Commander?

23:41.767 --> 23:43.500
Are you certain about this?

23:43.502 --> 23:45.536
Bryce, what is it we should know about?

23:45.538 --> 23:47.271
You need to tell us everything.

23:47.273 --> 23:49.673
I need some clearance before
I can say anything further.

23:58.718 --> 24:02.800
<i>Commander has requested
you return to base. Over.</i>

24:07.093 --> 24:08.492
He did it.

24:08.494 --> 24:10.761
They've called off the police.

24:30.850 --> 24:32.116
What happened?

24:32.118 --> 24:33.567
What about the police?

24:34.353 --> 24:35.786
They're gone.

24:35.788 --> 24:37.888
You... you're next.

24:39.558 --> 24:41.102
- They still haven't found.
- Let's go.

24:41.127 --> 24:42.650
What they're looking for.

24:47.099 --> 24:49.166
When you said you couldn't
get through to Cameron,

24:49.168 --> 24:50.734
why do you think that is?

24:51.971 --> 24:53.938
Not sure.

24:53.940 --> 24:57.608
Until a couple years ago,
he was my sweet boy...

24:57.610 --> 25:00.010
engaged, tuned in to the world.

25:00.012 --> 25:01.979
He takes it out on you.

25:01.981 --> 25:04.982
He still blames me
for kicking his dad out.

25:04.984 --> 25:07.718
I think he feels like
he doesn't fit in anywhere.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.303
Come with me.

25:15.561 --> 25:18.562
If you reveal any of the following
classified information,

25:18.564 --> 25:21.139
you'll be subject
to criminal prosecution.

25:21.901 --> 25:23.442
Understood.

25:23.869 --> 25:25.436
The NEC's HQ in Ottawa

25:25.438 --> 25:27.438
has been under lockdown
since last month,

25:27.440 --> 25:30.232
when a trace amount of
a viral sample went missing.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.818
Tell me more
about this archive at the NEC.

25:33.980 --> 25:36.146
What are the samples stored in?

25:36.148 --> 25:40.017
Titanium containers...
specially designed.

25:40.019 --> 25:42.353
They can only be opened
with a retinal scan.

25:44.056 --> 25:46.190
Who's authorized?

25:46.192 --> 25:48.459
Define viral sample.

25:48.461 --> 25:53.897
A genetically modified strain
of the flu virus known as H1N1.

25:53.899 --> 25:57.001
The NEC was working on a cure,
but when they modified it,

25:57.003 --> 25:59.370
wound up with something more lethal.

25:59.372 --> 26:04.241
The transmission vector
is aggressive and unpredictable.

26:04.243 --> 26:06.977
Best case, it could kill a few hundred.

26:06.979 --> 26:09.646
Worst case, a few hundred thousand.

26:09.648 --> 26:11.382
Maybe more.

26:11.384 --> 26:13.550
Only the highest-level employees
have clearance

26:13.552 --> 26:15.419
to the most hazardous materials.

26:15.421 --> 26:17.126
Alexis...

26:17.656 --> 26:20.414
<i>are you one of those
high level employees?</i>

26:20.760 --> 26:23.293
If Lucas broke into the NEC...

26:23.295 --> 26:24.795
It's stochastic terrorism.

26:24.797 --> 26:27.598
Release a deadly virus,
cause massive loss of life,

26:27.600 --> 26:29.800
unleash chaos.

26:29.802 --> 26:32.870
Dr. Wallace said that they took
his picture on a special camera.

26:32.872 --> 26:34.638
What if it has the capacity

26:34.640 --> 26:37.775
to bypass or trick a retinal scanner?

26:37.777 --> 26:40.625
They could open the container
without anyone knowing.

26:42.948 --> 26:44.681
My God.

26:45.152 --> 26:48.206
I'm the only one at
the conference with clearance.

26:50.456 --> 26:52.423
It's me.

26:52.425 --> 26:53.724
They're looking for me.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.651
If Lucas gets hold of that virus,

27:01.653 --> 27:03.186
who knows what he could do.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.554
As soon as I report this,

27:04.556 --> 27:06.589
I will be ordered to launch an assault.

27:06.591 --> 27:09.492
You do that, and a lot
of those hostages are gonna die.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.494
Well, not as many
as if they release that virus.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.463
Give Eric one more hour.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.964
If he tries to leave the island with it,

27:14.966 --> 27:16.432
you have the means to stop it.

27:16.434 --> 27:19.969
No. This is above my pay grade
and non-negotiable.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.472
Soon as my team's prepped,
we're... we're going in.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.442
We have to stop him.

27:26.444 --> 27:27.844
We have no jurisdiction here.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.512
We have to get Eric more time.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.414
Something's still missing.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.084
Who's next?

27:37.343 --> 27:38.588
Ma'am?

27:40.525 --> 27:42.692
You asked to keep your drops earlier.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.160
That's right.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.295
Do you wear contact lenses?

27:45.297 --> 27:46.562
Yes.

27:46.564 --> 27:48.631
I was hoping you were gonna
say that. Can I borrow them?

27:48.633 --> 27:49.666
Pardon me?

27:49.668 --> 27:50.867
Your contacts.

27:50.869 --> 27:54.504
Crazy as it sounds,
if you don't give them to me,

27:54.506 --> 27:56.172
we're all gonna die.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.859
Here. Put these in.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.294
Don't let them see.

28:18.296 --> 28:20.263
I don't wear contact lenses.

28:20.587 --> 28:22.498
I'm hoping it'll distort
your retinas enough

28:22.500 --> 28:24.867
to fool the camera.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.036
Don't let them see.

28:28.907 --> 28:29.706
Hey.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.807
Got it.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.342
The hostage takers used the account

28:32.344 --> 28:34.510
of a senior researcher, Alexis Tremblay,

28:34.512 --> 28:36.112
to get credentialed for the conference.

28:36.529 --> 28:38.414
She's the woman
that was flirting with Eric.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.382
That's not unusual.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.317
She has a son in there, about 19.

28:41.319 --> 28:42.785
He was giving Eric a hard time.

28:42.787 --> 28:45.288
- Can you find anything on him?
- Already did.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.489
Cameron Tremblay.

28:46.491 --> 28:47.924
Yeah, that's him.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.434
These things hurt.

28:58.436 --> 29:01.204
You. Your turn.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.272
Now!

29:13.985 --> 29:16.619
Seems Cameron has
been hanging out for the past two months

29:16.621 --> 29:19.689
in a chat room with one Keri Morel.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.190
One of our hostage takers.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.826
Their conversations are a mix
of misguided idealism

29:23.828 --> 29:25.628
and racing hormones.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.963
I think she targeted him.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.297
That could be it.

29:28.299 --> 29:29.932
Cameron used his mother's access

29:29.934 --> 29:31.701
to get them credentialed
into the conference.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.836
So they could have a mole on the inside.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.037
Eric will figure this out.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.506
More than likely.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.640
He'll use it.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.609
I'm gonna tell Commander Corman.

29:39.992 --> 29:41.210
Oliver.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.213
Thank you.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.671
Sit.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.429
No blinking.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.818
It's not her.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.155
Well, what do you know.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.626
You. Let's go.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.528
The lenses worked.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.163
They're still looking.

30:34.774 --> 30:36.899
These things are killing me.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.101
Don't take them out just yet.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.803
There's no one looking.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.412
Hey, Mom?

30:49.414 --> 30:50.646
You should go back.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.348
We don't want to antagonize
the hostage takers.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.850
I want to talk to my mom.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.718
Just a second, honey.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.789
Mom, are you crying?
What's wrong with your eyes?

31:00.658 --> 31:02.291
I'm okay.

31:06.097 --> 31:08.073
You don't wear contacts.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.032
It's you they want.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.034
You don't have to do this, Cameron.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.103
I know they asked you
to pretend to be a hostage

31:14.105 --> 31:15.471
so you could spy on us.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.106
What are you talking about?

31:17.394 --> 31:18.808
Don't.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.279
Lucas!

31:23.281 --> 31:24.780
Lucas?

31:24.782 --> 31:26.015
Cameron.

31:26.017 --> 31:27.783
What is going on?

31:27.785 --> 31:31.120
Whatever he told you
this is about, it's not.

31:31.122 --> 31:33.055
<i>It's all about him.</i>

31:39.297 --> 31:41.128
What's up?

31:45.236 --> 31:46.871
It's my mom.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.439
She used contact lenses
to screw with the camera.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.511
She's the one who can open it.

31:55.791 --> 31:57.980
Isn't this typical?

31:57.982 --> 32:01.517
You asked for our trust,
and then you betray us.

32:02.175 --> 32:04.327
Trust needs to be earned.

32:05.261 --> 32:06.455
And then it's rewarded.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.732
Let's try her again, shall we?

32:25.276 --> 32:27.076
All right, let's go.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.947
I said let's go!

32:34.652 --> 32:37.420
No! Baby!

32:38.590 --> 32:40.156
Why are you doing this?!

32:42.193 --> 32:44.994
Cameron, please!
Why are you doing this?!

32:55.222 --> 32:56.588
What is it? What's going on?

32:56.590 --> 32:59.152
Our explosives detector
just picked up a trace signal

32:59.154 --> 33:01.793
and located it to this spot.

33:06.621 --> 33:08.621
What the hell?

33:08.623 --> 33:10.523
That's ammonium nitrate.

33:10.525 --> 33:12.359
This much could destroy
the whole building

33:12.361 --> 33:13.344
and everyone inside.

33:13.346 --> 33:15.495
This is his backup plan in case
the police surrounded him.

33:15.497 --> 33:17.230
He knew we'd have to
base ourselves here.

33:17.232 --> 33:18.498
Hey, this thing could go any second.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.734
He won't trigger it
until he's unlocked that virus.

33:20.736 --> 33:22.869
- Can you defuse it?
- We're gonna try.

33:22.871 --> 33:24.637
All right people, listen up.
We're going in hot.

33:24.639 --> 33:26.239
You, get BDU here right now.

33:26.241 --> 33:27.207
You two, come with me.

33:27.209 --> 33:28.742
- Yes, sir.
- Roger that.

33:28.744 --> 33:30.098
All right, guys, let's get
things in motion.

33:30.122 --> 33:32.602
You two with me. Let's go.

33:32.881 --> 33:34.614
Commander.

33:34.616 --> 33:36.416
Eric has a way to negotiate this.

33:36.418 --> 33:37.650
What are you talking about?

33:37.652 --> 33:40.086
Cameron. He's the son
of one of the scientists.

33:40.088 --> 33:42.989
He's working with Lucas,
but he's not really one of them.

33:42.991 --> 33:44.391
And his mother's present.

33:44.393 --> 33:46.960
I know somehow Eric
will use that against Lucas.

33:46.962 --> 33:48.428
You just have to give him time.

33:48.430 --> 33:50.196
And I'll somehow win the Powerball.

33:50.198 --> 33:52.632
There's a madman in there with
a deadly virus and a detonator.

33:52.634 --> 33:53.566
The end.

33:53.568 --> 33:56.302
Eric Beaumont hasn't
lost a hostage in 17 years.

33:56.304 --> 33:58.204
I know he'll come through.

33:58.206 --> 34:00.673
I admire your faith in him, I really do.

34:01.843 --> 34:03.643
You have an hour of daylight left.

34:04.078 --> 34:05.979
Give me half that.

34:05.981 --> 34:08.782
If we hear nothing, then... go in.

34:09.951 --> 34:12.886
We have a chance here, however small,

34:12.888 --> 34:14.608
for zero casualties.

34:15.056 --> 34:17.623
There are two guards down already.

34:17.626 --> 34:19.292
All right. I'll give you half an hour.

34:19.293 --> 34:20.827
Whatever he's paying you,
it's not enough.

34:20.829 --> 34:22.262
Thank you.

34:22.996 --> 34:23.929
Well?

34:23.954 --> 34:26.498
Okay. He's giving us half an hour.

34:26.501 --> 34:29.135
I have an idea that will help Eric.

34:50.578 --> 34:51.944
Thank you.

34:53.527 --> 34:55.628
We have a problem.

34:55.630 --> 34:57.564
Chatter on the police radio.

34:57.566 --> 34:59.365
They found the explosives.

35:07.108 --> 35:08.908
Mr. Beaumont.

35:08.910 --> 35:11.589
Can you negotiate with these people?

35:12.013 --> 35:13.761
Not with their leader.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.049
He's too far gone.

35:16.051 --> 35:17.684
Then who?

35:22.791 --> 35:24.457
Lucas wants you.

35:35.270 --> 35:38.238
Careful. Safety's off.

35:56.491 --> 35:57.924
So, you got the virus.

35:57.926 --> 35:59.926
Congratulations.

36:02.063 --> 36:05.331
But I sense something has gone wrong.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.834
You're gonna negotiate
our way out of here.

36:09.137 --> 36:11.434
They discovered your escape plan.

36:11.973 --> 36:13.139
So, what was it?

36:13.141 --> 36:15.775
Some kind of distraction
to divert their attention

36:15.777 --> 36:17.110
while you got away?

36:17.112 --> 36:19.412
Enough explosive
to blow your team sky-high

36:19.414 --> 36:20.980
unless you make the phone call.

36:20.982 --> 36:24.239
Which is exactly why you're gonna
negotiate our way out of here.

36:24.686 --> 36:27.220
Well, you could do that even if I agree.

36:27.222 --> 36:29.756
Yeah, well,
you'll just have to trust me.

36:29.758 --> 36:31.858
I thought you were listening.

36:31.860 --> 36:35.261
You need to build a rapport
in order to earn trust.

36:36.665 --> 36:38.197
If they've found your explosives,

36:38.199 --> 36:40.008
the police have covered
every route out of here.

36:40.010 --> 36:41.534
There is no negotiator in the world

36:41.536 --> 36:42.936
that can get you off this island.

36:42.938 --> 36:45.071
You are stuck, my friend.

36:45.073 --> 36:47.373
Yeah, well, what's stopping me

36:47.375 --> 36:49.409
from releasing this here and now then?

36:49.411 --> 36:50.610
Lucas, that's not what...

36:50.612 --> 36:52.111
The plan?

36:52.113 --> 36:53.146
Let me guess.

36:53.673 --> 36:55.214
He told you
he's gonna use it as leverage

36:55.216 --> 36:58.017
to bring about the change
you all so desperately want.

36:59.593 --> 37:04.190
'Course, he'd never
actually release it, right?

37:05.794 --> 37:07.627
They would die for me.

37:09.397 --> 37:11.531
<i>Will you let your team die
because of you?</i>

37:13.134 --> 37:17.103
As much as I love my guys,
it's hardly a tough choice

37:17.105 --> 37:18.838
if it means saving the lives
of hundreds of thousands.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.920
Is this what you signed up for?

37:21.876 --> 37:24.077
Killing every person you know and love

37:24.079 --> 37:26.846
so he can go down in history as
the man who changed the world?

37:27.749 --> 37:29.816
I'm not bluffing. I'll do it.

37:29.818 --> 37:31.451
I know you will.

37:39.961 --> 37:41.027
Two more minutes.

37:41.029 --> 37:42.128
He'll come through.

37:48.169 --> 37:50.670
Make the call.

37:50.672 --> 37:51.804
Where were you? I just...

37:51.806 --> 37:53.706
Do it!

38:00.482 --> 38:03.149
You know, truth is, I agree with you.

38:03.952 --> 38:06.059
<i>My generation has screwed up.</i>

38:06.084 --> 38:09.722
We wasted natural resources,
we polluted the oceans,

38:09.724 --> 38:10.996
we tanked the economy,

38:10.998 --> 38:15.928
but releasing that virus is not
going to bring down the system,

38:15.930 --> 38:17.797
if that's what your goal is.

38:17.799 --> 38:20.533
It's just gonna make it worse.

38:23.038 --> 38:25.271
Damn.

38:25.273 --> 38:26.873
Straight to voicemail.

38:26.875 --> 38:29.575
I don't know.
Do I... Do I leave a message?

38:31.046 --> 38:33.312
Let's shoot this smug bastard.

38:35.946 --> 38:38.251
You're kidding me, right?

38:38.253 --> 38:39.752
Give her a moment.

38:40.922 --> 38:43.856
Committing murder can be
a life-changing decision.

38:43.858 --> 38:45.191
Lucas, you...

38:45.193 --> 38:47.293
you never said anything
about releasing the virus.

38:48.697 --> 38:50.396
Sacrifice for the greater good.

38:50.398 --> 38:54.100
That is what you meant, isn't it?

38:57.939 --> 38:59.572
Well, you know what they say.

39:00.975 --> 39:03.309
Want something done right...

39:03.311 --> 39:05.278
you got to do it yourself.

39:09.884 --> 39:12.051
Better he lives. Trust me.

39:22.931 --> 39:24.230
Thank you.

40:15.517 --> 40:17.193
So, how'd it go over here?

40:17.619 --> 40:19.042
You miss me?

40:19.754 --> 40:22.655
Yeah. I did.

40:22.657 --> 40:24.370
You know I did.

40:24.993 --> 40:27.266
You just want me to feel needed.

40:27.729 --> 40:29.362
I knew you could handle it.

40:31.834 --> 40:33.232
Thank you.

40:33.234 --> 40:34.300
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:39.808 --> 40:41.974
Not wishing to overstep boundaries,

40:41.976 --> 40:45.202
but are you out of your mind?

40:45.680 --> 40:47.814
Well, that depends
on the context, Oliver.

40:47.816 --> 40:49.982
Maxine's only been with the team
for a few months.

40:49.984 --> 40:53.119
You had no way of knowing
whether she'd succeed.

40:53.121 --> 40:58.591
And what's worse, it's unfair to Maxine.

40:58.593 --> 41:00.092
People could've died today,

41:00.094 --> 41:02.862
and she would have to deal
with that the rest of her life.

41:02.864 --> 41:06.966
You, of all people,
should understand that.

41:06.968 --> 41:09.502
Whose idea was it to broadcast
to the hostage takers

41:09.504 --> 41:10.703
that the police had found a bomb?

41:10.705 --> 41:12.408
Maxine's.

41:12.907 --> 41:16.876
She knew that it would
force Lucas to come to me.

41:16.878 --> 41:18.241
Yeah.

41:18.613 --> 41:20.714
Yeah, pretty smart.

41:21.082 --> 41:23.714
Then I guess she was ready.

41:23.952 --> 41:25.518
And I guess...

41:25.520 --> 41:26.352
You...

41:26.354 --> 41:28.654
- I was right.
- Right, yeah.

41:28.656 --> 41:30.056
You love to hear that, don't you?

41:30.058 --> 41:32.890
It is music to my ears, Oliver.

41:33.461 --> 41:35.161
Music to my ears.
