WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:03.737
("Speak Soft" intro
playing on radio)

00:11.412 --> 00:15.383
* She's been waiting

00:15.416 --> 00:19.053
* For the summertime

00:19.087 --> 00:23.124
* Now she's saving herself

00:23.157 --> 00:25.126
* For another guy

00:25.159 --> 00:27.661
* Speak soft, shut it off

00:27.695 --> 00:29.163
(sighs) There.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.731
That might help.

00:30.764 --> 00:34.068
All right, I never claimed
to be an outdoorsman.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.070
Yes, you did.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.172
Yesterday, when I told you
I was going on this hunt.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.474
Guys'll say anything

00:40.508 --> 00:42.210
if there's a chance
they might get lucky.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.078
And you think
you've got a chance?

00:44.112 --> 00:47.248
* She's been waiting

00:47.281 --> 00:51.252
* For the summertime

00:51.285 --> 00:55.289
* Now she's saving herself

00:55.323 --> 00:56.790
* For another guy...

00:56.824 --> 00:58.126
(turns off music)

00:58.159 --> 01:01.262
(bird squawking in distance)

01:01.295 --> 01:04.132
(grunts) So what's the point
of this whole,

01:04.165 --> 01:06.167
uh, scavenger hunt
thing again?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.235
Well, you know,
there's no point.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.469
I just like doing it.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.338
It's kind of a way
to connect with people

01:10.371 --> 01:12.273
without actually
having to deal with them.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.341
(gasps)
That's weird.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.144
No... that's a wooden crate.

01:16.177 --> 01:20.181
What's weird is driving
way out here to find it.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.119
Real excited about this,
aren't you?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.155
Well, usually
it's something small,

01:27.188 --> 01:29.490
like a little tin
or a coffee can.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.592
I've never seen anyone
do this before.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.668
(crow cawing)

01:40.701 --> 01:41.869
(grunts)
(crate top rattles)

01:49.343 --> 01:50.878
There's something
buried in here.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.452
Oh! Aah...!

01:58.486 --> 02:00.454
Just kidding.
(gasps)

02:02.390 --> 02:04.692
So, let's open it up, tough guy.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.196
(crate creaking)
(straining)

02:09.763 --> 02:15.469
(screaming)

02:35.223 --> 02:36.290
It's this ring.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.193
It has a funny effect on me.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.928
You closed the door.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.496
Yes, I did.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.365
Did you lock the door?

02:44.398 --> 02:45.766
(door opening)

02:45.799 --> 02:46.767
(knocking)

02:46.800 --> 02:48.902
I hope I'm not interrupting.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.439
But as my imminent departure

02:51.472 --> 02:53.507
grows more imminent...

02:53.541 --> 02:54.875
Oh, you finally decided
where you're going.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.347
You bought five tickets.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.216
Greenland,

03:02.250 --> 03:03.384
Australia,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.686
Greece, Alaska, Italy.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.388
- AMITA: Larry.
- That's it.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.690
You still have no idea
where you're going.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.559
Larry, I was afraid
you might be gone already,

03:11.592 --> 03:12.893
and I didn't get
to say good-bye.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.262
No, I'm still here.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.397
Ironically, uh,
simplifying one's life

03:16.430 --> 03:18.466
requires a more
complicated extrication.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.835
Larry...
why do all these tickets leave

03:21.869 --> 03:23.504
from Las Vegas?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.606
- Planning a little last hurrah?
- Hardly that.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.741
Being a sentimentalist,

03:27.775 --> 03:30.411
I just didn't want
to say good-bye from home.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.481
Well, I'm here on a much
simpler quest, I hope.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.317
There's a new movie opening
this weekend-- Bixel Street.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.951
Oh, yeah, I actually
want to see that.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.521
Well, here's your chance.
Someone pirated a copy of it

03:40.554 --> 03:41.955
and released it on the Internet.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.024
Was hoping you guys could
help me track the bootleggers?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.259
Yeah, we'll take a look
at it tonight.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.527
Uh, we'll make a date of it.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.296
LIZ:
That'd be great, thanks.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.431
Larry, just in case
I don't see you.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.932
Hey, where are you going?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.267
CHARLIE:
Greenland, Greece,

03:53.301 --> 03:55.436
Australia, Alaska...

03:55.469 --> 03:57.004
Or Italy.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.343
(indistinct background
radio communication)

04:02.376 --> 04:04.312
Message said
we caught a weird one.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.513
You weren't kidding, huh?

04:05.546 --> 04:09.016
When do I ever kid, Granger?

04:09.049 --> 04:09.950
Rope and a knife.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.353
Guess the killer wanted
to make sure, huh?

04:12.386 --> 04:13.821
There's a bullet hole
in the temple, too,

04:13.854 --> 04:17.558
and that's just the beginning
of weird on this one.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.560
See this stuff?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.295
You know those little packets

04:21.329 --> 04:23.797
you find in a box when you buy
a new TV or cell phone?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.300
Look like sugar;
say "do not eat."

04:26.334 --> 04:28.536
It's a desiccant;
it's designed to suck

04:28.569 --> 04:30.804
the moisture out of
whatever it's packed with.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.440
There's not a cell
in this guy's body

04:32.473 --> 04:33.941
that hasn't dried out
and collapsed.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.677
Okay, why?
What's the point?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.845
Make our jobs tougher, maybe.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.480
With the condition
of the corpse,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.849
it's near impossible to peg
a cause or time of death.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.017
Even an I.D. is gonna
be a long shot.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.020
Here's one for you.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.491
Why does the killer
cover up the details,

04:50.524 --> 04:52.360
then lead two kids right
to the body?

04:52.393 --> 04:53.361
Showing off.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.062
Trying to tell us
he's smarter than we are.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.665
(crickets chirping)

04:57.698 --> 05:00.901
(suspenseful music playing
on video)

05:00.934 --> 05:02.436
(man screaming on video)
Oh!

05:02.470 --> 05:03.671
Oh.
(both laughing)

05:06.507 --> 05:07.575
(taps computer key)

05:08.542 --> 05:10.344
Oh, for Pete's sake,

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
you gotta be kidding me!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.681
Why do you torture yourself
with this stuff?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.383
It's not by choice, believe me.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.418
I don't understand; you never
needed a computer before.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.953
Yeah, well, I do now,
if I'm going to find a job.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.389
Every firm I talked to requires

05:21.422 --> 05:22.956
that you have to know
how to do this

05:22.990 --> 05:23.957
geospatial simulation stuff.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.225
(knocking on door)

05:25.258 --> 05:28.496
Charlie, why don't you at least
offer to walk him through it?

05:28.529 --> 05:31.098
Because it's just,
it's better this way.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.034
- Hey, Cole, what's up?
- Hey, Don.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.903
I caught a weird one today;
I thought

05:35.936 --> 05:37.771
you should take a look
at this right away.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.806
- AMITA: Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.408
- COLBY: How you doing?
- Good.

05:40.441 --> 05:44.378
COLBY: This is on federal
parkland out near Palmdale.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.613
Is that a rope
around his neck?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.047
Yeah, plus a knife
in the chest,

05:47.080 --> 05:48.048
and a bullet in the head.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.116
DON: Why does he
look mummified?

05:49.149 --> 05:52.453
Well, that's the white stuff
that he's packed in.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.454
- It's a...
- Desiccant?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.588
DON: Check it out.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.390
Yeah.
How'd you know that, Charlie?

05:56.424 --> 05:59.560
CHARLIE: Liz gave us this movie.
Take a look.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.628
(taps key)

06:06.467 --> 06:07.901
(taps key, video rewinds)

06:07.935 --> 06:09.470
Let's open it up, tough guy.

06:11.439 --> 06:15.476
(woman straining)
(crate creaking)

06:15.509 --> 06:17.044
(woman screaming)

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
COLBY: Wait a minute,
that's it; I mean,

06:18.912 --> 06:20.414
this is exactly it.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.483
The body today, the murder--

06:22.516 --> 06:24.485
it was copied exactly
from this movie.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.521
(screaming)

06:34.962 --> 06:36.930
Killer did his homework.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.532
Looks like he nailed
every detail.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.067
Right. I mean, they've obviously
seen the movie.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.102
COLBY: Well, great, with a
pirated copy on the Internet,

06:42.135 --> 06:43.837
I mean, that narrows
our suspect pool,

06:43.871 --> 06:46.474
what, to, uh, like
a couple hundred thousand?

06:46.507 --> 06:49.109
Uh, I could get you guys a
ballpark figure just based

06:49.142 --> 06:51.078
on the actual number of
downloads that were logged.

06:51.111 --> 06:51.979
LIZ:
Hold on. The pirated version

06:52.012 --> 06:54.448
went up on the Web
only five days ago.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.149
You really think someone
could pull this off that fast?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.851
DON: That's a good point.
You gotta plan it,

06:57.885 --> 06:59.086
you gotta get the supplies,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.488
you gotta pull it off, and then

07:00.521 --> 07:02.823
have enough time
for it to dry out.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.892
So it had to have been someone
who saw the movie

07:04.925 --> 07:06.026
before it was pirated.

07:06.059 --> 07:06.827
And the coroner?
Anything with that?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.996
The cause of death
is a coin-toss.

07:09.029 --> 07:09.997
And thanks to the desiccant,

07:10.030 --> 07:12.232
all the normal methods
of dating are useless.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.068
Why not let the desiccant
give us our answer?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.771
I mean, it's not gonna
tell us when he was killed,

07:17.805 --> 07:20.574
but it will tell us how long
he was packed in that crate.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.843
See, every desiccant has its own

07:22.876 --> 07:25.078
rate of absorption,
its own level of thirst.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.047
So you find the rate of this
particular desiccant,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.483
calculate how long it took
to suck this guy dry.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.918
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that

07:30.951 --> 07:32.052
because the rate
of absorption changes,

07:32.085 --> 07:35.723
as does the body's willingness
to release its moisture.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.225
Okay, let's say a big, stray
dog showed up at your house.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.226
He's ravenously hungry.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.762
You're happy to feed him,
so you generously

07:41.795 --> 07:44.732
put out food
and he gobbles it up.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.200
The more he eats,
the less hungry he becomes.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.803
He keeps eating,
but the rate slows down.

07:49.837 --> 07:53.240
Likewise, as you run low
on food, you become stingier,

07:53.273 --> 07:56.176
offering smaller
and smaller portions

07:56.209 --> 07:57.210
which further slows the rate.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.947
The dog will clean you out
but at nowhere near

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
the ravenous rate
at which he began.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.917
Now, I'll have to make
additional allowances

08:03.951 --> 08:06.253
for temperature
and ambient humidity, but...

08:06.286 --> 08:08.255
How long?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.624
Faster with Larry's help.
I'm gonna go get started.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.292
Does the timing of this
bother anybody?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.294
The body pops up
just a couple days

08:14.327 --> 08:15.896
before this movie's released,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.566
right in the middle
of their marketing push...

08:18.599 --> 08:21.535
So you think this is some
kind of publicity stunt?

08:21.569 --> 08:23.236
You're not really
suggesting my studio

08:23.270 --> 08:25.205
would have someone killed
to promote a movie.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.141
Well, you've got over a hundred
million bucks on the line.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.711
You know, we've seen people
killed over a hundred dollars

08:30.744 --> 08:32.813
I have to admit
there have been some stinkers

08:32.846 --> 08:34.715
that could've used the hype--
but not Bixel Street.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.184
It's hot; hottest
release of the year.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.319
And this is Chris McNall.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.854
Already got him working

08:40.888 --> 08:42.556
on the sequel, that's how
hot this picture is.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.991
You're the writer.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.993
You're the FBI.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.895
I wrote an FBI picture once--

08:47.928 --> 08:49.930
Blood and Badge--
you've probably seen it.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.298
No.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.132
Really.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.400
Hey, no offense,
but what I have seen

08:53.433 --> 08:56.069
of Bixel Stree so far,
definitely left me wondering

08:56.103 --> 08:59.807
uh, what kind of sick mind
came up with that stuff.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.642
Now you know.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.944
So you guys are, uh,
investigating my copycat.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.345
I mean, that's pretty wild, huh?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.980
You sound almost
pleased about it.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.281
WHITE:
He's a writer.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.117
They crave any validation
they can get.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.585
DAVID: All right,
well, let me ask--

09:11.619 --> 09:12.920
aside from yourselves,
of course--

09:12.953 --> 09:13.887
who would've known the scene

09:13.921 --> 09:16.323
well enough to be able,
uh, to recreate it?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.792
It takes hundreds of people
to make a film.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.293
Even beyond the immediate crew,
copies of the script get out,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.629
circulate around town.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.163
In some cases,
they can make the rounds

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
for years before getting made.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.833
That was not the case
with Bixel Street.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.167
I pitched it to Carolyn.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.335
She hopped on board,

09:28.368 --> 09:30.370
pushed it into production,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.706
and I don't know, the whole
thing took, like, nine months--

09:32.740 --> 09:35.308
which is unheard of,
just so you know.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.610
See what I mean
about validation?

09:36.644 --> 09:37.811
Look, I can,
uh, get you a copy

09:37.845 --> 09:39.046
of the crew list,
if that'll help.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.614
Thanks.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.316
- Yeah, that won't be enough.
- COLBY: No?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.385
Nah, I researched the perfect
crime to write my movie.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.319
If this guy copied it

09:46.353 --> 09:48.889
as accurately as I heard,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.691
you're not gonna catch him.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.159
Cool case, though. Good luck.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.361
Should be fun.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.266
That should be good.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.801
Hey, good choice.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.803
Permeability of banana peel,
very similar

10:02.836 --> 10:04.672
- to human skin.
- Uh-huh.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.974
To approximate muscle tissue...

10:07.007 --> 10:11.244
and... as a control.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.380
And... not on the list,

10:13.413 --> 10:15.649
I just liked the idea
of dried apricots.

10:15.683 --> 10:16.383
(wry chuckle)

10:17.851 --> 10:18.986
How's Alan doing?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.654
Any luck on the job search?

10:20.688 --> 10:23.924
Yeah, you know, I think it's
been a little more trouble

10:23.957 --> 10:26.694
than he anticipated because
these, uh, design firms,

10:26.727 --> 10:27.761
they require
CAD proficiency now.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.262
Yeah.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.363
He's having a little trouble

10:30.397 --> 10:31.364
with the automata algorithms.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.367
You know, it used to be,
a planner simply stood

10:34.401 --> 10:37.170
on the raw land
and drew inspiration

10:37.204 --> 10:38.405
from his surroundings;

10:38.438 --> 10:40.674
but no, now it's all done
on a computer.

10:40.708 --> 10:44.011
Once again, technology
is impeding pure thought.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.847
Seriously, Charlie,
why won't you help him?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.183
Because it won't work.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.753
You're not embracing the "old
dog, new tricks" adage, right?

10:52.786 --> 10:55.222
I mean, Alan is perfectly
capable of learning.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.891
Yeah, I know he is.
But the whole

10:57.925 --> 10:59.392
son-teaching-father dynamic
doesn't work for us.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.828
Trust me.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.229
AMITA:
Come on, Charlie.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.232
It's bad enough what happened
to Alan's savings.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.036
All right, I'll do it,

11:09.069 --> 11:12.305
but I am telling you,
it will end in tears.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.410
Hey, did you ever wind up
seeing Sullivan's Travels?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.046
I did put it
in my Netflix queue,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.480
but just I keep
bumping it down.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.715
The main character

11:21.749 --> 11:22.783
is this big-time
Hollywood director

11:22.816 --> 11:24.151
played by Joel McCrea,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.319
and, the whole movie,
he's-he's wrestling

11:26.353 --> 11:29.723
with whether movies
should be art or commerce.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.092
I gotta tell you, there ain't
a whole lot of art in these.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.195
Hey, man, I'm doing
those, uh, checks

11:35.228 --> 11:36.496
on the cast and crew.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.198
You would be surprised,
you guys,

11:38.231 --> 11:40.500
how many deviants they hire
to make movies these days.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.334
This guy right here--

11:41.368 --> 11:43.136
he's a grip,
whatever that means--

11:43.170 --> 11:45.906
and he spent two years
in County for assault.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.374
Well, coroner was able
to I.D. our victim.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.876
DON:
I thought we didn't have

11:48.909 --> 11:50.243
- enough good DNA.
- DAVID: They found some

11:50.277 --> 11:51.244
in the pulp of
one of the teeth.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.380
Guess it was sealed up,
so it didn't dry out.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.215
Victim's name is Brett Fuller.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.316
He's a producer.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.818
He's got a few cheesy credits.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.519
Nothing I ever heard of, though.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.421
DON: Brain-Dead Donna,
The 17th Level,

12:01.454 --> 12:03.190
Love, Lace and Loss.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.758
See what I'm talking
about here, Colby?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
No, hang on a second.
I know those.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.762
Oh, but Sullivan's Travels
you've never seen.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.864
No, no, no, one of
the crew guys I just ran--

12:10.898 --> 12:13.066
he's got a bunch of
those titles in his credits.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.435
Victor Stokes--
he did props on Bixel Street,

12:15.468 --> 12:17.337
and he's worked on three
of Brett Fuller's movies.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.505
So he would know our dead guy.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.773
DAVID:
And he'd know the murder

12:19.807 --> 12:20.941
well enough to be
able to copy it.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.909
DON:
Check him out.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.418
COLBY:
Looks like we got three.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.552
Victor Stokes!

12:32.585 --> 12:35.255
- FBI! We want to talk to you.
- COLBY: Got a runner.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.924
I'll take the back.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.191
- Ready?
-Yeah.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.095
FBI! Don't move!

12:43.563 --> 12:45.765
Like you were going to.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.936
Clear.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.341
(gasps)

12:54.374 --> 12:55.843
Where're you going, Victor?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.445
Nowhere, I guess.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.913
Hmm.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.416
VICTOR:
It's a prop.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.919
(chuckling):
What did you think?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.354
A guy like me
killing somebody?

13:07.387 --> 13:08.588
Oh, come on.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.923
COLBY:
Okay, so you want

13:09.957 --> 13:11.358
to explain why you ran, then?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.526
I'd rather not say.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.566
(sighs) Okay.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.469
I might have spent some...

13:22.502 --> 13:27.340
prop money at a local
massage establishment recently.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.909
LIZ:
Counterfeiting?

13:28.942 --> 13:31.544
Oh, I... I look at it
as bartering.

13:31.578 --> 13:36.583
Their... services
for my movie memorabilia.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.551
You have a license
for all these?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.888
(laughing):
And then there's that.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.056
Yeah, licenses take time.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.526
Producers, directors, they...
they want everything yesterday.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.228
What are you going to do?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.630
When was the last time
you saw Brett Fuller?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.400
Geez, like... a year ago?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.602
He had some movie
lined up overseas.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.538
Malaysia, I think.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.607
You have any idea why somebody
would want him dead?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.109
Dead?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.346
(chuckling):
Well...

14:06.379 --> 14:09.549
the guy was good at talking
people out of their money.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.551
Anywhere else,
you'd call him a con man.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.054
Here, he's called a producer.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.588
Oh, so you're saying
he wasn't legit?

14:15.622 --> 14:18.391
Eh, he got movies made,
I guess.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.262
Although...

14:22.295 --> 14:24.331
th-th-this is a little weird.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.632
He said,
after the Malaysia thing,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.935
he was coming back
to make this movie.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.070
What do you mean,
"this movie"?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.638
Bixel Street.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.475
He said he had the rights,
he was going to produce it.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.647
Obviously, that never happened.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.083
ALAN:
Oh, wait-- whoa, whoa-- now!

14:43.116 --> 14:44.918
- What... What just happened?
- You jumped to the z-axis.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.086
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.587
- No, I-I-I...
- Well, the computer

14:47.620 --> 14:49.422
didn't do that on its own,
did it?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.391
You should not have
rotated on the y-axis,

14:51.424 --> 14:52.259
I told you.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.393
Oh, that just
doesn't make any sense.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.694
The whole program doesn't
make any sense, you know.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.562
Well, look, I'm just trying

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
to show you how it
works, all right?

14:57.630 --> 14:58.731
Did I write the program?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.633
- I didn't write the program.
- I know that, Charlie.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.369
You don't have to patronize me.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.937
You see, the problem is,

15:03.971 --> 15:05.272
a planner just doesn't
think this way.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.573
Man, I could've done it by hand.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.108
I could've drawn
the whole thing

15:08.141 --> 15:09.977
- by hand in half the time.
- LARRY: Hey, Charles.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.611
I did some early numbers
on the desiccant.

15:11.644 --> 15:12.579
You should see this.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.448
Go, go, go.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.717
Check your dried fruit.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.519
(sighs)

15:21.521 --> 15:24.057
No one filed a missing persons
report on Fuller.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.659
Last anyone remembers,
he was headed to Malaysia.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.528
Which matches what we got
from Stokes.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.696
Only the movie never happened.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.998
The financing fell through.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.465
LIZ:
Victor also said Brett Fuller

15:32.499 --> 15:34.534
was supposed
to produce Bixel Street.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.270
Guy's supposed
to produce the movie,

15:37.304 --> 15:40.640
then he gets killed in a scene
stolen from the movie?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.075
CHARLIE: Not stolen

15:42.109 --> 15:43.076
- from the movie.
- DON: What?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.644
It's only preliminary,
but it's already clear

15:44.677 --> 15:46.379
the numbers are well away
from what was anticipated.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.515
CHARLIE: Right, see, the
desiccant-- in this case,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.583
a porous crystalline
aluminosilicate--

15:50.617 --> 15:52.152
is initially highly absorbent,

15:52.185 --> 15:54.021
but there's a rapid decline
in the rate

15:54.054 --> 15:55.055
- of moisture transfer...
- Charlie.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.389
For the victim in this case

15:56.423 --> 15:58.491
to be dried
to the degree that he was,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.460
he had to have been packed
in that desiccant

16:00.493 --> 16:01.995
for a minimum of nine months.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.563
Nine months?

16:03.596 --> 16:06.066
That's before
the movie was made.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.734
That's before there
was even a script.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.402
Art imitates life,
it would seem.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.039
DON: So we've been going at this
all wrong.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.007
Killer didn't copy the movie.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.008
Yeah, the movie
copied the killer.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.988
COLBY:
Morning, Chris.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.091
Oh, you're back.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.693
Yeah. You're going
to be seeing a lot of us.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.228
Well, at least you brought

16:35.262 --> 16:37.264
a prettier partner
this time.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.531
Hey, where were you
five years ago?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.433
I wrote a little
bank heist picture.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.070
You would have been perfect
for Lola, the, uh,

16:43.103 --> 16:44.437
ex-gymnast/criminal mastermind

16:44.471 --> 16:45.805
with a handicapped son.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.806
Sorry.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.476
I do yoga, and I have
an able-bodied hamster.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.444
COLBY:
So you know a guy

16:51.478 --> 16:54.281
- named Brett Fuller?
- No. Who is he?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.348
The murder victim.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.583
LIZ:
Sure you don't know him?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.785
'Cause we heard he was supposed
to produce Bixel Street.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.553
(laughing)

17:00.587 --> 17:02.455
Okay, first rule of Hollywood:

17:02.489 --> 17:03.623
Never believe
anything you hear.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.691
There's probably a hundred guys

17:04.724 --> 17:05.692
claiming to produce
this picture.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.094
COLBY:
Yeah, but probably not

17:07.127 --> 17:08.328
a hundred guys who wound up dead

17:08.361 --> 17:09.396
and packed in desiccant.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.797
LIZ:
The murder happened

17:10.830 --> 17:12.365
before you wrote
your script, Chris.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.466
McNALL:
No, see, there's no way,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.069
'cause I talked to the coroner,
and it's impossible

17:16.103 --> 17:18.338
to establish a time line, so...
(clicks tongue)

17:18.371 --> 17:20.640
COLBY: Well, I hate to
contradict your expertise,

17:20.673 --> 17:24.177
but we happen to know that
Fuller was in that desiccant

17:24.211 --> 17:25.445
for at least nine months.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.114
LIZ:
You copied the crime,

17:27.147 --> 17:28.515
which either means
you committed it,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.183
or you know who did.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.451
Hey, look, that's pure fiction,

17:31.484 --> 17:33.420
and, you know,
as much as I'd like to stay here

17:33.453 --> 17:34.754
and help you finish
writing your story,

17:34.787 --> 17:37.424
I don't think you
could afford my quote, so...

17:39.526 --> 17:40.760
Ciao.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.231
DAVID:
You think he's lying?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.532
LIZ:
Of course he's lying.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.267
DAVID: Charlie's timeline could
be wrong.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.502
COLBY: Nah, Chris McNall
either committed this murder,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.504
or he's got information
on the real killer.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.739
I believe the latter.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.842
But if the victim really has
some connection to this movie...

17:55.875 --> 17:57.744
It's a little too cozy
to be a third party.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.646
All right, let's
dig into this guy.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.148
Let's get a warrant.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.483
Let's go after his phones,
his banking, everything.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.684
I'll get on it.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.153
Let's pay a visit
to the victim's house.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.220
All right.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.522
DON:
Make any decisions here?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.458
Oh, I don't know
that it much matters.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.693
They all offer the distance
I'm looking for,

18:13.726 --> 18:16.463
away from the clutter
of technology.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.432
You say all this stuff
about technology, but I remember

18:19.466 --> 18:21.501
you were pretty fired up
about the Hubble.

18:21.534 --> 18:25.705
Well, the Hubble transported us
to new corners of the cosmos,

18:25.738 --> 18:28.341
but in an infinite universe,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.577
how is some new corner
any better than our own?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.780
Ah, just...

18:33.813 --> 18:36.549
for the fresh eye
of Copernicus... gazing up,

18:36.583 --> 18:38.785
nothing between him
and the stars,

18:38.818 --> 18:41.188
not even Galileo's telescope.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.157
Yeah, there is something
about the idea of just...

18:44.191 --> 18:46.893
taking off that-that's
appealing, isn't it?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.528
CHARLIE:
Hey.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.530
LARRY: Hey, how did the, uh,
computer session go?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.565
As expected.

18:52.599 --> 18:56.636
So, now, both my fiancГ©e
and my father are mad at me.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.638
Well, what about Amita?
Maybe she'd have

18:58.671 --> 19:00.807
- better luck with him.
- We're going to find out,

19:00.840 --> 19:02.742
'cause she's going to try
later today.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.278
Part of me wishes her luck,
and the other part

19:05.312 --> 19:07.547
of me hopes that she can
understand my suffering.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.549
How's the case going?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.452
Did the timeline I sent you--
did that help out at all?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.487
Well, we're still
working it, so...

19:14.521 --> 19:16.389
LARRY: How could anyone
be so arrogant?

19:16.423 --> 19:17.324
He commits murder,

19:17.357 --> 19:19.526
and then he tells
the whole world about it

19:19.559 --> 19:21.261
by featuring it in his movie.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.929
You know, Larry,
at this point in my life,

19:22.962 --> 19:24.197
nothing would surprise me.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.865
See this?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.634
- Oh, is this the guy?
- Yeah.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.770
Yeah?
Writer and software salesman.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.205
Huh. What is Cinepal?

19:32.239 --> 19:33.540
Cinepal...

19:33.573 --> 19:36.376
a collaborative
scriptwriting program.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.545
It automatically suggests
story lines, plots

19:38.578 --> 19:39.779
and character arcs.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.881
More technological clutter.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.251
You mind if I keep this?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.652
No. Go ahead.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.487
(rock music playing
in distance)

19:47.520 --> 19:49.322
So the guy's been dead
nine months,

19:49.356 --> 19:50.590
who's paying the gardener?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.859
And who's playing his stereo?

19:57.597 --> 19:58.565
(rock music blares from stereo)

19:58.598 --> 19:59.499
Hey. What's up?

19:59.532 --> 20:02.335
We're looking
for Brett Fuller's house.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.570
Yeah, you found it.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.238
I'm Tyson, Brett's assistant.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.573
Mind if we come in?

20:10.643 --> 20:11.544
DAVID:
Hey.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.745
You been living here?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.780
Uh... (chuckles)

20:13.813 --> 20:17.650
(turns off music)
Just house-sitting, really.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.287
So when's the last time
you heard from your boss?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.589
Uh, well, he left for Malaysia

20:22.622 --> 20:25.825
like, um... ten months ago?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.460
Look,

20:27.494 --> 20:30.463
I didn't hear from him, so yeah,
I sort of moved in.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.664
Ah, beats paying rent, huh?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.733
Are you kidding?
I mean, satellite TV,

20:33.766 --> 20:35.302
a washer-dryer.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.369
I'm in heaven, man.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.537
And it didn't occur to you,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.306
after ten months,
that maybe something

20:39.339 --> 20:40.640
had happened to Brett?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.913
Did something happen to Brett?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.848
He's dead, Tyson.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.951
Tyson, who's been paying you?

20:51.984 --> 20:54.387
Brett left 60 grand cash

20:54.421 --> 20:55.655
under the bathroom sink.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.789
60 grand?

20:56.823 --> 20:59.959
I take my salary out of that--
nothing else, I swear--

20:59.992 --> 21:01.361
and I file payroll taxes...

21:01.394 --> 21:02.462
Okay. Hey, listen.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.030
Did your boss know
Chris McNall?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.598
The writer?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.334
Uh, I know they had lunch.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.701
I do Brett's expenses.

21:08.735 --> 21:09.769
I probably still
have the receipt.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.676
Dude, he's dead. He's...

21:17.977 --> 21:20.547
(shudders, sighs)

21:20.580 --> 21:21.814
Here.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.687
It's dated ten months ago.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.624
"Lunch with McNall and D.W."

21:31.658 --> 21:33.726
Okay, uh, who is D.W.?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.562
I don't know.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.466
Am I going to have
to move out now?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.402
AMITA: Forget about Charlie

21:42.435 --> 21:44.671
and his whole x-, y- ,z-axis
approach.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.740
For me, it's best just
to put yourself in the space.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.041
If you can imagine yourself

21:49.075 --> 21:50.677
inside the figure
you're creating,

21:50.710 --> 21:53.846
you get a better reference
for direction.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.548
Does that help?

21:55.582 --> 21:56.549
I'm sure it's supposed to.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.387
All right, don't, don't try
to be nice.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.755
If you can imagine yourself
inside that cube, you'd have to

22:02.789 --> 22:05.091
imagine yourself being crushed
by four collapsing walls.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.394
Oh, I'm sorry, Alan.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.396
Oh, my mind just doesn't
work this way.

22:09.429 --> 22:13.633
I mean, this is written for
a totally different generation.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.068
Yeah, but I mean, you have
so much experience and talent.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.571
You'd be an asset to
any of these firms.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.574
They have hundreds of applicants
to choose from these days.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.443
Sure, they'll find someone
with my talent

22:23.476 --> 22:25.144
and with the ability to do this.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.746
Do you need a job that badly?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.648
What do you mean, money-wise?

22:28.681 --> 22:29.716
No, I'm fine for now.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.151
But, you know, down the line,
as things change,

22:32.184 --> 22:33.620
and you and Charlie
get married...

22:34.987 --> 22:36.389
CHARLIE:
Hey, there.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.725
Hey.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.793
Look what I bought.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.996
Cinepal-- it's professional
screenwriting software.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.033
It's supposed to help you
write scripts.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.001
- You're writing a script?
- I don't know.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.739
More I'm curious
about something.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.107
McNALL:
I just feel

22:55.141 --> 22:56.809
so fortunate that,
from the get-go,

22:56.843 --> 23:00.179
the studio realized what an
extraordinary story this is,

23:00.212 --> 23:03.015
and they were committed
to telling it my way.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.686
All right.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.556
Hey.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.923
(bell rings)
Got time for one more interview?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.859
What do you think?
I sound all right?

23:12.892 --> 23:15.695
Someone in Hollywood told me not
to believe everything I hear.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.896
Good advice.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.799
Yeah. Apparently.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.468
You lied to us.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.102
You said you didn't
know Brett Fuller,

23:23.135 --> 23:25.738
but you had lunch with him
on January sixth.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.874
You got someone
who saw us together?

23:27.907 --> 23:30.777
Yeah. I talked
to the assistant who set it up,

23:30.810 --> 23:31.711
and I have a receipt.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.580
Oh, receipt.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.147
Well, uh,
that's interesting.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.884
It's, it's not really
proof, though, is it?

23:37.917 --> 23:38.818
(wry laugh)

23:38.851 --> 23:40.887
You know, I think
you killed Brett Fuller.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.790
I think you packed him
in desiccant, left him for us

23:43.823 --> 23:46.125
to discover, because
you're a twisted, arrogant

23:46.158 --> 23:48.895
ass who thinks
he can get away with it.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.631
What-what you think, though,
isn't really the issue, is it?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.165
The issue is what
you can prove,

23:53.199 --> 23:54.867
and-and you can't
prove anything.

23:54.901 --> 23:55.902
So...

23:55.935 --> 23:58.137
You should try the Danish.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.607
It's unbelievable.
Seriously.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.846
DAVID: You know, what pisses me
off most about this guy

24:06.879 --> 24:08.014
is that he's right.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.181
We can't prove it.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.883
Which is how he designed it.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.852
Well, until we get some good
evidence, there's no point

24:12.885 --> 24:14.654
going back to him, 'cause
he's just gonna lawyer up.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.723
I think he's enjoying this too
much to hide behind an attorney.

24:16.756 --> 24:17.724
Check this out.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.725
I've been going through

24:18.758 --> 24:19.759
the writer's bank records.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.227
On January sixth, the same day

24:21.260 --> 24:22.929
he had lunch with the victim,

24:22.962 --> 24:24.831
he took out 120 grand cash.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.966
Yeah, follow that money.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.101
All right, Brett Fuller had
60 grand cash in his bathroom.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.336
That's half.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.939
But there were two guys at lunch
that day with McNall, right?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.106
The victim and this D.W.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.508
Well, that's exactly
where I'm going.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.176
So, the month leading up
to this lunch,

24:37.209 --> 24:39.078
he wrote four checks
to a Deborah Westbourne.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.847
Oh, your D.W.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.949
If it is, we got a witness
who can put McNall

24:42.982 --> 24:44.584
with the victim
near the time of the murder.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.589
I'm guessing D.W. hasn't
hit the big time yet.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.192
The glamorous side
of Hollywood, hmm?

24:53.225 --> 24:54.661
Yeah. No kidding.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.631
Hello? Anybody here?

24:58.665 --> 25:00.232
LIZ:
FBI, Ms. Westbourne.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.869
We'd like to talk to you.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.203
No!

25:05.304 --> 25:07.239
Grab my knife! Cut her down!

25:07.273 --> 25:09.976
Liz, what are you waiting for?
Grab my knife!

25:10.009 --> 25:10.910
- Come on!
- It won't help.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.845
She's already dead.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.246
There's still time. Come on.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.848
Feel her, David. She's cold.

25:17.283 --> 25:21.287
The chair rigged to the door,
the hanging.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.022
It's another scene
from the movie.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.557
We played right into it.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.626
She was dead before we got here.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.027
Oh.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.271
The son of a bitch.
He is taunting us.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.908
Two murders, both copied
straight out of the movie.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.310
- Okay, why?
- Because he's a smug psychopath

25:44.343 --> 25:46.178
who thinks
he can get away with it.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.647
Ah, I would have
believed that before,

25:47.680 --> 25:48.681
but the victims, the money.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.749
I mean, there's a motive here.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.853
Okay, what if what
Victor Stokes told us was true:

25:53.886 --> 25:55.722
That Brett Fuller
really was supposed

25:55.755 --> 25:57.056
to produce Bixel Street.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.325
Maybe Deborah Westbourne
was, too.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.260
They were both low-level,
B-movie types.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.029
Yeah, but so was McNall
up until now.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.263
Everything he wrote
was low-budget.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.632
Most of it went straight to DVD.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.934
- All right. So?
- What if McNall

26:07.967 --> 26:11.638
took his movie idea
to Fuller and Westbourne first?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.205
LIZ:
Gets in bed with them early on.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.774
COLBY:
But then he gets some interest

26:14.807 --> 26:16.208
from one of the big studios,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.310
only the big studio doesn't want
to have anything

26:18.344 --> 26:19.211
to do
with his low-budget producers.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.648
So he starts
by paying them to go away.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.716
But that doesn't work,
at least not with Fuller.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.618
Right, so Fuller gets
the desiccant treatment.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.987
And Deborah Westbourne
gets a noose around her neck

26:28.020 --> 26:29.689
when she becomes
a potential witness.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.326
Now, if I remember
correctly, um,

26:34.360 --> 26:36.262
it was your move.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.732
Hmm...

26:39.766 --> 26:42.301
You do realize, uh,
by your leaving,

26:42.334 --> 26:44.804
I'm forced to be back to
playing against Charlie.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.372
Well, if I have any regrets,

26:46.405 --> 26:48.975
it is leaving my friend
in his time of need.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.977
Yeah, well, lots
of people are going

26:51.010 --> 26:52.645
through tough times right now.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.213
I'll find something.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.716
I'll just have
to lower my sights some.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.388
Well, you will never be happy
in a job that fails to inspire.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.990
I really wish I had

27:04.023 --> 27:06.325
your cool about heading
into the unknown.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.259
On the contrary,

27:07.293 --> 27:09.361
I have more
than a little apprehension.

27:09.395 --> 27:13.766
I simply remind myself,
this is not a destination.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.268
It is merely a stop
on the journey.

27:19.806 --> 27:23.309
Well, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.077
I wish you the same, sir.

27:25.111 --> 27:28.280
But in the meantime...
checkmate.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.652
(screaming)

27:35.321 --> 27:36.989
AMITA:
What are you watching?

27:37.023 --> 27:40.292
And since when are you working
in adaptive algorithms?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.094
(pauses video)
Well, it's the, uh,

27:42.128 --> 27:43.896
the screenwriting software
I bought-- Cinepal.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.265
I broke it down
to its root functions.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.368
Oh. Now you're having
a Chris McNall film festival?

27:49.401 --> 27:52.271
Yeah. You know, McNall's
had 11 of his movies made.

27:52.304 --> 27:56.308
And all of them fit perfectly
into my Cinepal algorithms.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.711
Charlie...

27:58.745 --> 28:00.713
I'm worried about your dad

28:00.747 --> 28:02.782
and this whole job search.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.283
Well, I mean, you know him.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.352
He doesn't like to be idle.

28:06.385 --> 28:10.422
Yeah, but now he feels
he has to work because of money.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.124
I mean, he's worried
about being able

28:12.158 --> 28:15.327
to afford a place
to live after we get married.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.163
- The wedding's a year away...
- No, but listen, Charlie--

28:17.196 --> 28:21.033
my grandparents always lived
with my parents.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.403
And I have an uncle who stayed
with us when I was born.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.005
I'd have no problem

28:26.038 --> 28:27.774
if Alan continued
to live with us.

28:30.242 --> 28:34.213
Look, you know I'm not thinking
of throwing my dad out

28:34.246 --> 28:36.783
onto the street,
but it would be nice,

28:36.816 --> 28:40.086
if after we were married,

28:40.119 --> 28:42.254
I had some alone time with...

28:42.288 --> 28:44.290
with my wife.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.293
Just you and me.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.999
I was, uh, I was
thinking about yesterday.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.500
At school?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.102
Mm-hmm.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.870
When you came into my office,

28:57.904 --> 29:00.439
and then you kissed me.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.440
I was wondering

29:01.473 --> 29:04.877
what would've happened

29:04.911 --> 29:07.413
if Larry hadn't have walked in.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.248
Did I just hear my name?

29:10.416 --> 29:11.517
Sorry. Maybe if you carried

29:11.550 --> 29:13.019
your phone with you?

29:13.052 --> 29:14.253
Don called.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.354
He requires your help.

29:15.387 --> 29:18.090
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.527
(elevator bell dings)

29:21.560 --> 29:23.462
DON:
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.397
CHARLIE: No problem.
What do you need?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.267
David and Colby have been
trailing the writer all day.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.501
They lost him.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.937
You did a cell phone
triangulation scheme

29:30.970 --> 29:31.938
for us before.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.106
Took you half the time
it would take our techs.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.242
Well, we just need to access
the signal through his provider.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.476
All right, well, I've
already got it set up.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.411
(beeping)

29:42.514 --> 29:44.016
(trilling)
LIZ: David,

29:44.050 --> 29:45.985
Charlie's got him.
He's about four blocks

29:46.018 --> 29:47.186
to your northeast.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.554
Got that. Is he in motion?

29:48.587 --> 29:50.056
Looks like he's stationary.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.924
LIZ: Negative, David.
He's stationary.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.359
Yeah, he...

29:53.392 --> 29:55.394
He's on the corner
of, uh, Plumber and Orion.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.970
COLBY: Is there anybody who
isn't writing a script

30:04.003 --> 30:05.037
in this town?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.839
There.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.408
In the corner.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.543
We got him.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.479
COLBY: Our boy isn't
looking so good.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.150
He just got a text message.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.385
Doesn't look happy about it.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.552
He's moving.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.421
COLBY: All right,
I'll go get the car.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.092
DON:
We got the phone warrants.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.293
Why don't we look at the text?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.595
I'd have to stop
the tracking triangulation.

30:29.628 --> 30:30.596
I can take over.

30:30.629 --> 30:34.533
Consider it my last submersion
into technology.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.312
How does he find time to write?

30:46.345 --> 30:47.546
There's over a hundred texts,

30:47.579 --> 30:48.514
just from today.

30:48.547 --> 30:52.618
But there were six,
including the last one,

30:52.651 --> 30:54.586
from some number I can't access.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.122
All of a similar ilk.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.489
LIZ:
"I know what you did."

30:57.523 --> 30:59.491
"You're going to pay."

30:59.525 --> 31:01.493
All right, so, blackmail--
there we go.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.628
Here's the last one:
"If you're not here

31:02.661 --> 31:04.196
in ten minutes,
it all comes out."

31:04.230 --> 31:06.365
Yeah. Where is here?

31:12.504 --> 31:15.374
- Hey, don't get too far behind.
- I'm not. We're good.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.348
- Colby, you need to get over.
- Yeah, thank you. I'm trying.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.016
COLBY:
Move it up.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.651
All right, come on.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.253
You got to move up.
(honks horn) Let's go, man.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.389
(tires screeching)

31:30.422 --> 31:31.623
- COLBY: Come on!
- MAN: Whoa!

31:31.657 --> 31:33.325
COLBY: You got to be
kidding me.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.226
(horn honking)

31:34.260 --> 31:35.995
Come on!
(horn honking)

31:36.028 --> 31:37.496
DAVID (over radio):
Liz? Liz, we lost visual.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.431
Charlie's still got him.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.599
He's headed north on Western.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.535
Mm, the cell signal's
breaking up.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.504
(honking)
Move!

31:45.537 --> 31:46.638
Back it up! Let's go!

31:46.672 --> 31:49.608
(honking)

31:51.277 --> 31:54.613
It dropped out
somewhere near Franklin?

31:54.646 --> 31:57.349
All right, we're back; we're
back up and rolling again.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.351
- DAVID: How far behind are we?
- I've got nothing. I lost him.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.087
DAVID:
Liz, are you there?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.956
What have we got?

32:03.990 --> 32:05.091
Tell 'em we lost him.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.258
DAVID:
Liz?!

32:06.292 --> 32:07.994
Wait, wait, wait. I got it.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.062
LIZ:
David, Elysian Park.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.964
It's another scene
from the movie-- the third act

32:11.998 --> 32:14.100
when the pilot finds
the dead hooker.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.568
That's right. Uh, it took place
at Angel Point.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.271
David, go to...
go to Angel Point.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.374
(engine revving)

32:22.408 --> 32:24.276
That is weird.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.644
What?

32:25.677 --> 32:27.313
The murder in the third act.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.647
It-It's the wrong
story structure--

32:28.680 --> 32:30.282
it doesn't fit with the Cinepal

32:30.316 --> 32:32.084
algorithm like all
of his other scripts.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.627
COLBY:
All right, so where is he?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.530
DAVID: Liz, we're gonna
need some help here.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.531
Okay, it's down the hill,

32:45.564 --> 32:47.033
and, uh, in the movie,

32:47.066 --> 32:50.469
there was a statue,
or a sculpture of some kind.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.171
Okay, that's got to be it.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.778
I don't see anything.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.714
DAVID: Liz, we don't see him.
Where is he?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.250
LIZ (over radio):
Try looking up.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.184
What?

33:07.753 --> 33:09.721
Where the hell is McNall?

33:09.755 --> 33:10.756
(motorcycle starts)

33:10.789 --> 33:11.757
I got him.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.060
Liz, we got a body.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.028
It's Carolyn White,
the studio exec.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.363
(motorcycle revving)

33:36.448 --> 33:37.749
LARRY:
Hey, get anything?

33:37.783 --> 33:40.052
We've got LAPD looking.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.287
No luck tracking his phone?

33:41.320 --> 33:44.056
(sighs) He either turned it off
or he lost it.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.492
Forgive the presumption,

33:46.525 --> 33:48.494
but I detect
there's more bothering you

33:48.527 --> 33:50.229
than just his whereabouts.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.465
I'm just trying to make
sense of it, Larry.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.435
The murder scene in the park--
it's right out of the movie.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.439
But McNall didn't choose
the spot; the blackmailer did.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.541
Yeah, oh...

34:02.574 --> 34:04.710
I admit I am struggling
with the logic myself.

34:04.743 --> 34:08.547
Why would a studio boss
blackmail her writer,

34:08.580 --> 34:11.450
especially if she needs him
to write the sequel?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.418
You know, I'm not so sure

34:12.451 --> 34:13.752
that she does need him
to write the sequel.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.287
You know, this is
the 12th movie

34:15.321 --> 34:16.488
that McNall has written,

34:16.522 --> 34:19.658
and all the others fit perfectly
into a predictable format,

34:19.691 --> 34:20.726
dictated by a set of algorithms.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.562
- You mean the Cinepal program.
- CHARLIE: Right.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.797
Hey, Charlie, we're
in the last act. Spit it out.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.666
Well, it occurred to me
while we were tracking him

34:27.699 --> 34:29.635
that this movie
doesn't fit at all.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.804
Structurally,
Bixel Street runs contrary

34:32.838 --> 34:36.175
to the Cinepal algorithms
at almost every story point.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.811
So you think maybe Chris McNall
didn't even write Bixel Street?

34:39.845 --> 34:43.749
I can't say for sure, but this
is a very strong indication.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.386
COLBY: How much longer
you want to wait?

34:47.419 --> 34:49.688
DAVID: Where else
is McNall going to go?

35:05.871 --> 35:06.672
DAVID:
McNall!

35:06.705 --> 35:09.741
(gunshots)

35:09.775 --> 35:11.310
DAVID:
Don't be stupid.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.679
There's no way out for you.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.482
Who is that?

35:16.515 --> 35:17.483
The FBI!

35:17.516 --> 35:18.917
Okay.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.719
Okay, I'm sorry.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.421
I'm coming out, I'm com--

35:22.454 --> 35:24.723
Hands up, hands up,
hands over head!

35:24.756 --> 35:26.492
I di--
I didn't know it was you.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.593
- McNALL: I'm sorry.
- COLBY: Put that gun down.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.561
- Okay, I'm putting it down.
- Let's go, put it down.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.830
Gun's going down.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.800
Okay, gun is down,
gun is down.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.735
I'm sorry.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.770
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Did I...

35:38.804 --> 35:40.406
did I... did I hit anybody?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.508
Fortunately, you
shoot like you write.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.475
Who'd you think we were?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.679
You know, you just...
you can't be too careful.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.715
Uh-huh.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.917
DON:
You took a shot at my agents.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.253
You have any idea
the kind of hot water you're in?

35:54.286 --> 35:56.822
Just hold on a second,
all right? It was dark.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.056
They didn't identify themselves.

35:58.089 --> 36:01.393
When I fired, my state of mind
was that I felt threatened,

36:01.427 --> 36:03.829
which is grounds for a
justifiable act of self-defense.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.731
Oh, so now you're a lawyer?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.966
Let me guess,
you wrote a courtroom script.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.604
Schwimmer was attached until
the financing fell through.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.374
I know who you were
shooting at tonight,

36:15.407 --> 36:18.310
or you thought you
were shooting at.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.248
The real writer
of Bixel Street.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.315
(chuckles)

36:23.349 --> 36:24.316
Come on.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.417
Read the trades, all right?

36:25.451 --> 36:28.220
Check out any of the 500
billboards around this town.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.655
All right, my credit
is right there--

36:29.688 --> 36:30.789
"Written by Chris McNall."

36:30.822 --> 36:34.893
And you are desperate to keep
that credit, aren't you?

36:34.926 --> 36:38.730
So desperate you'd rather risk
three murder charges

36:38.764 --> 36:41.267
than just admit the truth.
(McNall chuckles)

36:41.300 --> 36:44.536
You've seen Hitchcock's
Dial M for Murder, right?

36:44.570 --> 36:47.406
Robert Cummings tells Ray
Milland that in stories,

36:47.439 --> 36:50.376
things turn out the way
the author wants, but...

36:50.409 --> 36:52.311
in life, they don't.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.783
Bixel Street is my movie.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.788
See this guy here?

37:05.023 --> 37:07.493
He can prove it's not.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.729
LIZ: Brett Fuller
and Deborah Westbourne--

37:10.762 --> 37:12.631
they found the script,
didn't they?

37:13.999 --> 37:15.467
And they brought it to you.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.812
No one would take them
seriously with their credits.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.448
They needed access
to the studio.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.982
Right,
and you needed them gone.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.685
I paid them, all right?
I paid them to go away.

37:33.719 --> 37:34.820
I didn't kill anybody.

37:34.853 --> 37:39.024
(deep, heavy sigh)

37:39.057 --> 37:42.861
The kid did that-- the one,
the one who wrote the script.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.330
LIZ:
Who, Chris?

37:44.363 --> 37:46.465
Who's the real writer?

37:48.600 --> 37:52.003
Guy who works for Brett-- Tyson.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.872
He's brilliant.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.007
McNALL:
He's an artist, you know?

37:56.041 --> 37:57.943
So did that hack
finally confess?

37:57.976 --> 38:01.913
He didn't confess 'cause
he didn't actually kill anybody.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.382
(laughing): I'm not talking
about the murders.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.351
I'm talking about
stealing my script.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.352
DAVID:
Come on, Tyson.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.486
Out the pool.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.957
Why didn't you just come out

38:11.990 --> 38:13.792
and say something
when they first stole it?

38:13.825 --> 38:16.595
I didn't even know till I read
about it in the trades.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.096
By then it's a
green-lit project.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.332
If I'd have popped up
yelling "foul,"

38:20.366 --> 38:22.067
the studio might
have backed out.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.769
Plus, it's a better ending
this way.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.737
Three people that ripped me off
are dead.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.939
The fourth's going to go down
in total humiliation.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.641
COLBY: What about
what happens to you?

38:29.675 --> 38:32.544
(laughing):
Me? Are you kidding?

38:32.578 --> 38:34.380
Starting tomorrow,
I top the A-list.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.681
There's not an agent in town

38:35.714 --> 38:36.948
that won't be scrambling
to sign me.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.084
Yeah, too bad you'll be writing
from prison.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.952
Locked in a cell,
no one to bother me,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.555
I can crank out five
or six movies a year.

38:43.589 --> 38:44.790
Oh, grab that script, will you?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.024
Don't want to leave it out

38:46.057 --> 38:47.626
where some other bozo
could steal it.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.403
Bixel Street
opens up tomorrow,

38:57.436 --> 38:58.837
but they got a midnight show
tonight.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.938
You interested?

38:59.971 --> 39:03.442
Oh, thanks, I'm actually
going to hook up with Robin.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.944
Let me guess, you're going to
cuddle up with an old classic.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.046
The Travel Channel, actually.

39:08.079 --> 39:08.980
See you, boys.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.149
DAVID:
Hey.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.784
How about you two?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.720
Anybody up
for a midnight show?

39:14.753 --> 39:15.921
You've seen it already, right?

39:15.954 --> 39:18.390
Yeah, well, you know, I like
the energy of the audience,

39:18.424 --> 39:20.091
the smell of popcorn.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.960
Weird thing is, when this
story hits the news tomorrow,

39:21.993 --> 39:23.595
it's only going to
make that film

39:23.629 --> 39:25.096
bigger than it already is.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.798
All the more reason
to catch it tonight.

39:28.767 --> 39:29.968
- How about you, Colb?
- No, I got to try

39:30.001 --> 39:31.136
and finish this.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.004
(scoffs)
Since when do you read?

39:33.038 --> 39:34.906
It's that kid Tyson's
new script-- it's insane.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.575
LIZ:
Looks like I'm on my own, then.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.109
Good night.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.645
Are you still going?

39:39.678 --> 39:41.046
DAVID:
Isn't that kind of sad?

39:41.079 --> 39:42.581
I do it all the time.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.916
It's better than sitting
at home with the hamster.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.820
The script really that good?

39:48.854 --> 39:51.523
Yeah, and you got to read it.
You know what it's about?

39:51.557 --> 39:52.791
I have no idea.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.661
COLBY:
A prison break.

39:57.863 --> 39:58.997
Thank you.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.231
- What are you doing?
- Making a copy.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.067
First thing in the morning,
I'm getting it to the director

40:02.100 --> 40:03.168
of the detention center.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.136
Yeah, well, give me
the last ten pages, at least.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.572
You're gonna have
to wait, man.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.773
- Come on.. Come on.
- It's not happening.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.075
(Alan types, computer beeps)

40:10.108 --> 40:12.711
I knew you were
going to do that.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.980
- Hey, you got a minute?
- ALAN: Yeah, just a sec.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.015
I think I got this thing licked.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.117
Really?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.552
How? What happened?

40:20.586 --> 40:22.120
It fell for my Rook
to Rook 6 feint.

40:22.153 --> 40:22.988
It's the oldest trick
in the world.

40:23.021 --> 40:23.989
Bingo.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.592
You're playing chess.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.660
Yeah, well, of course.
What'd you think I was doing?

40:28.694 --> 40:32.531
Alan... Charlie and I
were talking, and...

40:32.564 --> 40:35.701
We cannot bear the thought
of you getting stuck

40:35.734 --> 40:38.169
in some stupid job
to pay rent somewhere.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.071
AMITA:
Even after we're married,

40:40.105 --> 40:42.941
we don't want you feeling
like you have to move out.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.011
What if I was a technical
consultant to a software firm?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.078
- What?
- I got a job

40:47.112 --> 40:49.014
with the same company that wrote

40:49.047 --> 40:50.849
that ridiculous CAD program.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.117
You despise those people.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.485
You were in the process

40:53.519 --> 40:54.986
of writing them hate mail,
weren't you?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.187
Yeah, I was, till I realized

40:56.221 --> 40:57.656
that they were right here
in Pasadena,

40:57.689 --> 40:59.725
so I went down
to cuss them out in person,

40:59.758 --> 41:01.159
and they ended up
giving me a job.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.061
I'm going to help
retool that software

41:03.094 --> 41:05.597
to make it more user-friendly.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.632
You know what I mean?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.199
(chuckles)
Congratulations, Alan.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.935
Thank you,
and the job pays well,

41:09.968 --> 41:11.770
so by the time
you two get married,

41:11.803 --> 41:14.039
I'll be able to afford
a little place of my own.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.174
AMITA: You don't have
to do that.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.943
We meant what we said.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.611
She did, anyway.

41:19.645 --> 41:20.679
I'm kidding; I'm kidding.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.681
I'm very, very happy for you.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.015
- Thank you. Thanks.
- That's great.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.685
- Thank you.
- Where are Larry's bags?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.620
Oh, I tried to get him to wait.

41:28.654 --> 41:29.988
He's gone?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.158
He wasn't supposed
to leave until tomorrow.

41:33.191 --> 41:37.195
I know, he said it was,
it was hard to say good-bye.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.565
We don't even know
where he's going.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.066
Well, neither does he.

41:41.099 --> 41:44.803
* Leavin' my family

41:44.836 --> 41:48.640
* I'm leavin' all my friends

41:48.674 --> 41:51.242
* My body's at home

41:51.276 --> 41:54.880
* But my heart's in the wind

41:54.913 --> 41:59.885
* Where the clouds
are like headlines *

41:59.918 --> 42:04.222
* On a new front-page sky

42:04.255 --> 42:07.092
* My tears are saltwater

42:07.125 --> 42:08.994
* And the moon's full and high

42:09.027 --> 42:10.829
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

42:10.862 --> 42:13.031
(tires screeching)

42:13.064 --> 42:14.265
(turns off music)

42:35.120 --> 42:43.128
* I know Martin Eden's
gonna be proud of me now *

42:43.161 --> 42:48.600
* Many before me has
been called by the sea *

42:48.634 --> 42:54.105
* To be up in the crow's nest

42:54.139 --> 42:58.777
* Singin' my say

42:58.810 --> 43:08.720
* Shiver me timbers
as I'm a-sailin' away. *
