00:01.301 --> 00:03.502
<i>Thanks for
downloading this fox show.</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.738
<i>And don't miss
all-new episodes on fox.</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:10.175
<i>Previously on sleepy hollow... Are
you gonna be at my birthday party?</i>

00:10.177 --> 00:11.276
Yeah, he'll be there.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.311
Cool. See you later, dad.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.848
You just said that the creature

00:15.850 --> 00:18.550
<i>disguised itself as someone
they all trusted.</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:22.054
Molly!

00:22.056 --> 00:23.322
We will find her
before midnight.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.957
<i>Because that is when</i>

00:24.959 --> 00:26.759
<i>the witnesses acquire
their powerful mantle.</i>

00:32.232 --> 00:33.565
The past month is the first time

00:33.567 --> 00:35.534
I felt that what we do
makes a real difference.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.570
Yeah, poison Ivy, mosquitoes,
got to love it.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.305
Come on, you live for this
as much as I do.

00:40.307 --> 00:43.075
Dreyfuss is alive
and jobe is in the wind.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.410
Is there any indication
what they have planned?

00:44.412 --> 00:47.746
I have a powerful need
to make sure the entire world

00:47.748 --> 00:49.982
changes for the better.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:26.720 --> 01:28.854
Hello, there, old friend.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.523
Please have a seat.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.693
I have really been looking
forward to showing you

01:34.695 --> 01:37.196
what I've done with the place.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.339
Is this really what you wanted,
dreyfuss?

01:49.576 --> 01:51.143
The death of democracy?

01:51.145 --> 01:55.314
Only a washed-up founding father
could...

01:55.316 --> 01:57.382
possibly mourn the loss
of something

01:57.384 --> 02:00.385
so criminally ineffectual.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.421
You take this off for one minute

02:02.423 --> 02:04.823
and I will show you mourning.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.060
Once a patriot,
always a patriot.

02:13.666 --> 02:17.669
Do you know what I've come to
learn over the years, Mr. crane?

02:17.671 --> 02:21.073
People... by and large,

02:21.075 --> 02:23.675
people are herd animals.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.011
When it comes right down to it,

02:26.013 --> 02:30.349
most people, they really
don't want to bear the burden

02:30.351 --> 02:32.451
of governing themselves.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.955
Deep down, most people
are violently opposed

02:36.957 --> 02:41.527
to the effort it takes
to think for themselves.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.462
Do you know what

02:43.464 --> 02:46.932
all of the willingly
helpless, bleating sheep

02:46.934 --> 02:49.601
really want,
more than anything else?

02:51.204 --> 02:53.038
A Shepherd.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.540
You mean tyrant.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.875
Actually, I prefer emperor.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.845
Czar, perhaps?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.514
Monarch, maybe.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.751
Whatever rolls off the tongue.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.496
<i>Malcolm?</i>

03:17.498 --> 03:19.131
<i>Malcolm?</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:23.135
Malcolm?

03:23.137 --> 03:25.237
Can you hear me?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.240
Another vision?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.576
Either that,

03:30.578 --> 03:34.413
or the headless horseman
had some serious LSD

03:34.415 --> 03:36.848
galloping in his bloodstream.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.220
Jobe.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.756
Jobe, jobe, jobe, jobe...

03:44.758 --> 03:46.758
It was spectacular.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.595
So the plan
you've set in motion...

03:49.597 --> 03:51.230
My plan,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.098
not to boast,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.933
but I am destined

03:54.935 --> 03:59.671
to become the best thing

03:59.673 --> 04:04.176
that has ever happened
to America.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.111
Hello, America.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.280
My name is ichabod crane,

04:08.282 --> 04:10.215
and I have a message
for all and asunder.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.683
Okay,
you're not doing it right...

04:11.685 --> 04:13.085
What do you mean
I'm not doing it right?

04:13.087 --> 04:14.453
What am I doing... You
cannot hold it so close

04:14.455 --> 04:15.787
to your face, there won't
be any room for a caption.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.356
Well, maybe I don't want a...

04:22.128 --> 04:24.796
Well.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.931
Time for an upgrade.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.099
Molly, what do you say?

04:27.101 --> 04:28.267
I'm sorry, Mr. crane.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.268
Please, no need.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.803
If anything, I should apologize.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.139
Whilst I am an expert
in many fields,

04:34.141 --> 04:36.708
I should have acknowledged
that you, miss Molly,

04:36.710 --> 04:40.445
are the master of the sacred
ritual of the selfie.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.814
Your generation is so weird.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.118
My generation?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.254
You know, people try
to put us down...

04:49.256 --> 04:52.057
Just because we get around.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.159
What? Who?

04:56.663 --> 04:57.729
Nice one.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.499
Why don't you try take two?
Why not?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.334
In a sec,
I just want to post this

05:02.336 --> 05:04.569
to Mr. crane's
new picagram account.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.071
Obliged.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.613
Thanks for coming today.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.249
No, not at all.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.950
After the occurrences of late,

05:18.952 --> 05:21.586
'tis a pleasure
to enjoy a diversion.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.622
No kidding.

05:23.624 --> 05:27.592
Witnesses, wolf-dads...

05:27.594 --> 05:30.796
It's important for Molly to know
she's still a kid.

05:30.798 --> 05:34.166
No child should have to bear
the weight of the mantle

05:34.168 --> 05:35.901
that miss Molly has inherited.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.338
I posted it.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.339
Jolly good.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.606
Though, it's kind of pointless

05:41.608 --> 05:43.208
since you don't have
any followers.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.044
Well, there is more to life

05:46.046 --> 05:49.181
than amassing followers,
miss Molly.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.384
Social media is rife
with, what, cat videos?

05:52.386 --> 05:53.518
But just imagine

05:53.520 --> 05:54.653
what could be achieved,

05:54.655 --> 05:55.987
what grand heights
could be scaled

05:55.989 --> 05:58.056
were a true leader
like Jefferson

05:58.058 --> 05:59.624
or Lincoln alive today.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.663
What if they had access
to Facebook and picagram

06:04.665 --> 06:06.231
and snapchat?

06:07.467 --> 06:09.968
We have an opportunity,

06:09.970 --> 06:13.205
an opportunity to spread a
noble message far and wide.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.539
So.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.642
Instead of gathering followers
to hashtag selfies...

06:17.644 --> 06:19.845
My god, Logan's here!
Okay, just wait for us.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.147
I'm honestly nothing
without my followers.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.015
Seriously, thank you. Thank you.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.718
I watched several
of Mr. McDonald's videos

06:26.720 --> 06:28.887
in preparation for this event.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.088
Found them rather mundane.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.189
Tell me about it.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.725
Diatribes on acne, dating,

06:33.727 --> 06:35.927
gossip, lip gloss.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.029
You guys don't get it.
He's really funny

06:38.031 --> 06:40.031
and he knows what it's like
to feel different.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.733
My parents don't get it, either.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.870
Can I borrow your phone?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.772
Okay.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.074
We love you!

06:50.110 --> 06:51.110
There you go.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.912
Well, great.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.119
Mom, what is happening to him?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.120
Someone help him!

07:02.122 --> 07:03.789
Somebody call 911!

07:03.791 --> 07:05.123
He needs a doctor!

07:05.125 --> 07:06.124
No pictures!

07:06.126 --> 07:07.893
No pictures! Logan needs help!

07:07.895 --> 07:09.895
Can you move back?
Move... move back.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.630
Move back, please.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.465
We got to get him out of here.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.434
Careful, careful.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.969
Something about his
ailment is amiss.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.805
I'll investigate further.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.640
I'll take Molly home
and I'll meet up with you

07:21.642 --> 07:23.875
as soon as possible. Understood

07:23.877 --> 07:25.444
come on, we have to go.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.945
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.151
So, seriously, mom?
Security cameras?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.986
Hey, if demonic creatures
and dark forces

07:34.988 --> 07:36.288
are gonna be crossing our paths,

07:36.290 --> 07:38.223
I'm gonna see 'em first, in hd.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.225
Well, what if
it's an invisible monster?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.093
This should help.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.162
Celtic shield knot,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.298
used by ancient druids

07:46.300 --> 07:48.500
to ward off shades,

07:48.502 --> 07:51.670
were-beasts and
wandering spirits.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.005
And it's not tacky at all.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.407
I like it.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.677
I'm gonna go check on updates
on Logan.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.978
All right. Hey, you hungry?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.012
Yeah, sure.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.314
Okay.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.185
Usually more inquisitive.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.187
An Internet celebrity
she follows

08:09.189 --> 08:10.856
came down with something.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.024
Crane's checking it out
at the hospital now.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.193
So, not the common cold.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.863
Lately, is it ever?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.198
I'm gonna go to the
hospital after Clara comes.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.366
I can stay with Molly.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.335
Thanks,

08:23.337 --> 08:25.170
but the nanny's
just a couple blocks away.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.639
I know, but...

08:27.641 --> 08:30.609
I'd appreciate the chance
to get to know Molly better.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.211
I can take her
out to my trailer,

08:33.212 --> 08:35.179
we can make a whole day
out of it.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.217
Look, I know you're shaken

08:40.220 --> 08:42.854
by what went down
with the whole fake dad thing,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.190
but all the defense in the world
is not gonna make a difference

08:45.192 --> 08:47.092
if we treat this thing
with kid gloves.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.165
I have a lot I can teach her.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.901
You're not gonna teach
her how to shoot bazookas

08:55.903 --> 08:57.402
or use throwing stars, are you?

08:57.404 --> 08:58.537
Actually,

08:58.539 --> 09:00.906
I was thinking we might
just start with a pizza.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.144
Molly?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.646
Yeah?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.081
I'm headed to the hospital.
I'm gonna check on Logan.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.484
Jenny's gonna stay here
and order lunch, okay?

09:12.486 --> 09:16.288
Cool, can she teach me how
to use throwing stars?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.992
You have my number.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.694
Please call me
if you need anything.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.929
Yeah.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.538
My god, you want to see
the creepiest video ever?

09:33.540 --> 09:34.940
I can't stop watching it.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.777
It's like Chewbacca mask lady
meets bad lip reading.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.245
Something tells me you and I

09:40.247 --> 09:42.447
have vastly different
definitions of "creepy."

09:42.449 --> 09:44.115
Come on. Check it.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.252
This guy I follow on picagram
posted it an hour ago.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.989
How old are you again?

09:52.391 --> 09:55.393
Excuse me, do you have anything

09:55.395 --> 09:57.128
from provence?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.064
You know, it's just...

09:59.066 --> 10:02.267
This napa rosé's a little too
fruit-forward for my palate.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.169
You know your pink wine.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.304
I'm sorry.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.206
Missy. I'm Jake.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.647
She a friend of yours?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.816
Yeah, yeah,
we came here together.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.820
I'm sorry,
no, no, not like, like,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.989
together-together, but in a...

10:23.991 --> 10:25.457
The same car together.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.159
Just as friends, yeah.

10:28.161 --> 10:32.163
We, um, we planned
these simultaneous tinder dates.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.266
Yeah. Just promised
to have each other's backs,

10:35.268 --> 10:37.335
in case things
got a little awkward,

10:37.337 --> 10:42.173
we could just slide in
and save each other.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.978
Except, um, yeah,
my date stood me up.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.087
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.989
And, um, for the record.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.493
It's not me, it's you.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.535
What did you say to him?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.706
I'm not saying
that guy had zika,

11:14.708 --> 11:16.608
but I know a thing or
two about diseases,

11:16.610 --> 11:19.210
and that guy looked like he
had a scary-ass case of zika.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.578
Is that who I think it is?

11:22.848 --> 11:23.915
Master Wells.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.886
I'm here to
investigate a young man

11:27.888 --> 11:31.222
who's experienced what appeared
to be a supernatural seizure.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.225
What, a rash growing up his arms
with glowing tendrils?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.994
It's tendrilitis?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.562
Please, no. Is that a thing?

11:37.564 --> 11:38.797
He's kind of weird about germs.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.398
We came here
because we saw a guy

11:40.400 --> 11:42.500
with the same freaky symptoms.
Yeah, her tinder date.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.736
Dude. Is that really
necessary information

11:44.738 --> 11:45.904
that needs to be shared?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.505
It seems many others

11:47.507 --> 11:50.241
have been admitted with
the same symptoms.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.044
Which room might I find
your paramour?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.045
Tinder date.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.213
Well...

11:55.215 --> 11:56.347
Room b14.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.586
I'd take salmonella over a
supernatural disease any day.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.321
Well, just because crane's here

12:03.323 --> 12:04.689
doesn't mean
it's definitely supernatural.

12:04.691 --> 12:08.493
I mean, there are dozens
of biological explanations

12:08.495 --> 12:09.594
for these sort of symptoms.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.062
Trust me, it's monster flu.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.438
I hear your call.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.440
I will join you.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.908
You can't be in here!

12:33.753 --> 12:35.620
I really hate it
when you're right.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.991
Good, just keep me posted
with any new information

13:12.993 --> 13:15.493
you get, okay? Thank you.

13:17.563 --> 13:21.599
The CDC reports similar cases
all around the Washington area.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.134
They're testing every virus
and bacteria known to man;

13:23.136 --> 13:24.469
No hits so far.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.138
Someone with similar symptoms
just burst into flames

13:27.140 --> 13:29.440
in silver spring.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.309
They started a fire
that burned down

13:31.311 --> 13:32.677
the whole wing of a hospital.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.980
Look, these are isolated cases,
but if this keeps spreading,

13:35.982 --> 13:38.116
this whole city could
burn to the ground.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.685
Which may have been precisely
what happened the last time

13:40.687 --> 13:42.887
this affliction reared
its head in Washington.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.458
Master Wells, would you kindly
search the secret histories

13:47.460 --> 13:50.295
for any entries penned
by Paul Jennings?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.629
Of course. Yes.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.364
During the war of 1812,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.366
the British forces
invaded Washington, D.C.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.802
Now, 'tis common knowledge they
burned down the white house,

13:57.804 --> 13:59.637
the capitol building...

13:59.639 --> 14:01.172
In fact, half the city.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.641
There have been thousands of
fires in D.C. over the years.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.877
But very few have coincided
with the outbreak

14:05.879 --> 14:07.679
of a virulent disease.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.380
Documentation of
these tragic events

14:09.382 --> 14:12.717
was penned, not by
president Madison,

14:12.719 --> 14:14.552
but by a young servant

14:14.554 --> 14:16.221
called Paul Jennings.

14:16.223 --> 14:20.525
Servant, yes,
and white house slave.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.628
Jennings was a great mind
who refused to be held back

14:23.630 --> 14:25.029
by the mores of the day.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.366
Look at this.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.803
<i>According to
master Jennings' account,</i>

14:31.805 --> 14:33.471
<i>the morning the city burned,</i>

14:33.473 --> 14:35.707
<i>pamphlets were hammered up
across the capital,</i>

14:35.709 --> 14:37.575
<i>hours before
the British army attacked.</i>

14:41.380 --> 14:43.615
<i>These were more than
a warning of British intent.</i>

14:44.583 --> 14:46.818
<i>All those who read the pamphlets</i>

14:46.820 --> 14:49.053
<i>came down with
a mysterious illness.</i>

14:50.189 --> 14:51.356
<i>Whilst many turned their backs</i>

14:51.358 --> 14:52.857
<i>on the afflicted,
fearing cholera,</i>

14:52.859 --> 14:54.926
<i>master Jennings and the rest
of the white house staff</i>

14:54.928 --> 14:57.662
<i>flung open their doors and
vowed to conquer this epidemic</i>

14:57.664 --> 14:59.264
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

14:59.266 --> 15:02.066
<i>With symptoms
ranging from high fevers</i>

15:02.068 --> 15:04.269
<i>to pulsing hot rashes,</i>

15:04.271 --> 15:06.738
<i>master Jennings
labeled the sickness</i>

15:06.740 --> 15:10.108
<i>"influenza incendium,"
or "fire flu."</i>

15:10.110 --> 15:11.576
I must join you.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.279
Be still, let us tend to you.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.617
Mother of mercy.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.185
I will join you.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.620
I will join you in the flames!

15:29.128 --> 15:31.462
Paul Jennings was a hero.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.598
And also, it seems,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.468
the only one who understood
that a cursed pamphlet

15:37.470 --> 15:41.339
caused the outbreak
of this dread influenza.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.042
For this plague is spread

15:44.044 --> 15:47.145
not by biological means...

15:47.147 --> 15:48.813
But by language.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.582
Well, that may have worked
in the war of 1812,

15:51.584 --> 15:53.117
but nobody reads pamphlets now.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.820
Not unless they're 140
characters or less.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.992
I think I know
how it's spreading.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.828
My tinder date was telling me

16:03.830 --> 16:05.096
about this video
that he watched,

16:05.098 --> 16:06.564
before he got sick.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.134
It was posted on some kid named
Logan MacDonald's picagram feed.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.805
My guess is that somebody
hacked his account

16:13.807 --> 16:15.173
and then embedded
the pamphlet's curse

16:15.175 --> 16:16.975
into the video's source code.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.177
Meaning that whoever watches it

16:19.179 --> 16:23.314
could get infected by this
fire flu that burned Washington.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.515
My god.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.218
Molly.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.757
Okay.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.527
This is a real viral video.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.197
Has to be dreyfuss.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.033
It does indeed.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.902
But hunting dreyfuss now would
be a costly distraction.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.872
This curse is out.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.240
And we must contain it.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.511
Hello?

16:53.513 --> 16:54.979
Jenny, put Molly on, right now.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.215
Hey, your mom wants to talk.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.316
Hello?

16:58.318 --> 17:00.618
Honey...

17:00.620 --> 17:03.187
Did you watch any videos
posted by Logan MacDonald?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.856
Mom, no, why?

17:04.858 --> 17:05.857
Did you?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.657
No, why?

17:07.660 --> 17:10.294
Jenny and I have been out
hiking, hanging in her trailer.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.797
This is seriously
the best day ever.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.137
Okay.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.570
All right, honey, just...

17:20.573 --> 17:23.875
You can put Jenny back on.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.176
Yeah?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.712
<i>There's a viral video</i>

17:27.714 --> 17:30.248
going around, it's infecting
people with an ancient curse.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.250
Can you just make sure
that Molly's nowhere near

17:32.252 --> 17:34.085
phones or computers today?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.020
You got it, no problem.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.021
<i>Jenny,</i>

17:37.023 --> 17:39.424
thank you.

17:39.426 --> 17:43.361
Okay, so, can we get back to
this whole witness test thing?

17:43.363 --> 17:47.832
Yeah, but, actually, it is
an ancient Buddhist tradition

17:47.834 --> 17:49.367
used to help acolytes

17:49.369 --> 17:51.269
determine which path to follow.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.538
Anyone can use it who has
a question in their heart

17:53.540 --> 17:55.173
they need answered,
not just witnesses.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.746
So, Buddhists like bananas?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.114
Technically, it's supposed
to be a persimmon.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.783
A symbol of joy in the harvest.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.652
Use your imagination.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.589
Okay, close your eyes.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.593
Breathe in through your nose.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.262
Out through your mouth.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.633
Each one of these objects

18:22.635 --> 18:25.136
gives off a distinct vibration.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.872
Your mind should be tuned
to receive one of them.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.162
You watched it.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.296
Didn't you?

18:55.667 --> 18:58.002
He kept insisting.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.172
I just... i-i wanted him
to shut up, so I hit play.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.707
And now...

19:05.110 --> 19:06.911
Whatever this fire flu
is, Jake...

19:08.747 --> 19:10.148
I'm infected.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.023
I fear the worst, agent Thomas.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.859
If this video
truly has gone viral,

19:21.861 --> 19:23.794
thousands of lives could
hang in the balance.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.198
Well, not even the government
can shut down the Internet.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.834
I have heard great
orators of yore make hay

19:29.836 --> 19:33.871
from more dire situations
than this, agent Thomas.

19:33.873 --> 19:37.842
Sometimes all the people need
are some words of leadership.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.379
People of Washington!

19:41.381 --> 19:43.381
Switch off your mobile devices!

19:43.383 --> 19:44.448
They are dangerous!

19:44.450 --> 19:48.319
Your mobile device
is now a weapon!

19:48.321 --> 19:49.987
Switch them off!

19:49.989 --> 19:51.055
Now

19:57.863 --> 19:59.463
could've told you
that wasn't gonna work.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.201
Hey, hey. Stop.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.204
Stop! Stop!

20:06.206 --> 20:09.240
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

20:09.242 --> 20:10.841
Relax.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.043
She's infected.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.252
We can fix this.
I have to get out of here.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.087
If I don't, I could
burn this place down,

20:23.089 --> 20:24.422
I could burn you.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.357
We'll figure it out as soon
as crane and Diana come back.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.592
Yeah, and what if we can't?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.760
Look, my tinder date said
that he watched the video

20:29.762 --> 20:31.562
an hour before he got sick.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.097
And I'm at, I'm at...

20:33.099 --> 20:34.365
I'm at 55 minutes.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.900
I won't let you go through
this alone, okay?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.668
Jake, I'm not your
responsibility, okay?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.237
You are my friend, Alex.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.405
And we're in this together,
whatever this is.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.907
What are you doing?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.108
Alex.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.444
Stop! Wait! Open the do...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.212
Open it!

20:48.214 --> 20:50.448
Alex! Alex!

20:50.450 --> 20:51.882
Damn it!

20:51.884 --> 20:53.584
Alex, she's infected.
She ran off down the tunnels.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.586
What is going on? She watched
the video an hour ago.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.821
She is burning up.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.258
If she's in the tunnels,
she's entered a maze.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.593
She could emerge
anywhere in the city.

21:02.617 --> 21:04.428
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

21:04.429 --> 21:06.564
Alex, where the hell are you?

21:06.566 --> 21:09.567
Don't try to come after me.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.969
If you want to help,
just find a cure.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.071
Alex, we can do that
with you here.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.873
<i>No. Moving, it...</i>

21:15.875 --> 21:16.941
<i>It helps.</i>

21:20.746 --> 21:24.181
Alex...

21:25.284 --> 21:27.451
If I just follow the voice...

21:27.453 --> 21:28.452
What voice?

21:28.454 --> 21:30.821
I need... you...

21:30.823 --> 21:32.790
<i>Alex?</i>

21:32.792 --> 21:33.824
<i>A-Alex!</i>

21:33.826 --> 21:35.259
She's gone.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.594
But she's alive.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.263
And as long as she is,
we can find a cure.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.798
Now, the first course of action

21:40.800 --> 21:42.667
lies here in the vault,
so we will need

21:42.669 --> 21:44.001
your expertise, master Wells.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.137
The contagion has been
stopped in the past,

21:46.139 --> 21:47.705
it can be stopped again.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.675
Master Wells.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.515
You need to focus.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.183
You understand?

21:59.185 --> 22:01.619
Yes, sir.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.954
Good man.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.623
Jake.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.192
Just now, on the street,
we saw an infected woman.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.761
Her back was glowing, it
looked like a triangle,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.797
with arabic writing around it.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.931
Arabic...

22:17.436 --> 22:19.503
Arabic...

22:23.275 --> 22:24.675
I know that symbol.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.778
I've seen one just like that
in the histories.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.548
Where is it?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.317
Here.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.252
Very good, master Wells.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.191
Of course.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.159
This is master Jennings'
handwriting.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.661
Okay, we're on the right trail.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.064
It seems master Jennings
had other duties beyond those

22:47.066 --> 22:49.633
in his work for the Madisons.

22:49.635 --> 22:53.704
He was, in fact,
an operative of agency 355.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.140
He worked in this very vault.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.378
<i>He was not the only one.</i>

23:00.380 --> 23:01.879
<i>There was a team.</i>

23:01.881 --> 23:04.815
<i>Samuel Wilson,
butcher and patriot,</i>

23:04.817 --> 23:08.686
<i>who would go down in history
as the legendary "uncle Sam."</i>

23:08.688 --> 23:11.522
<i>Davy Crockett,
frontiersman, congressman,</i>

23:11.524 --> 23:14.024
<i>and hero
of the Texas revolution.</i>

23:14.026 --> 23:17.094
<i>Master Paul Jennings,
white house slave,</i>

23:17.096 --> 23:20.531
<i>and eventually,
a freed abolitionist.</i>

23:20.533 --> 23:22.700
<i>And sacagawea,</i>

23:22.702 --> 23:25.703
<i>native American guide,
and the real powerhouse</i>

23:25.705 --> 23:29.273
<i>behind the famed
Lewis and Clark expedition.</i>

23:29.275 --> 23:31.942
<i>It seems their exploits
were legion,</i>

23:31.944 --> 23:33.878
<i>and described in this volume.</i>

23:33.880 --> 23:36.747
<i>The truest expression
of Washington's dream...</i>

23:36.749 --> 23:39.116
Okay, normally,
I'd be right there with you,

23:39.118 --> 23:41.585
geeking out, Mr. crane,
but how is this gonna help Alex?

23:41.587 --> 23:45.089
Well, it says here master
Jennings' experiments

23:45.091 --> 23:46.557
with the cursed pamphlet
soon revealed

23:46.559 --> 23:49.927
that the hex in question was
the curse of an Arabian demon

23:49.929 --> 23:51.429
known as a djinn.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.264
Or as the French
would come to call it,

23:53.266 --> 23:55.633
genie.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.134
Finally a monster I know.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.303
Okay, so we're after
a blue guy that grants wishes

23:59.305 --> 24:00.438
and lives in a lamp?

24:00.440 --> 24:02.306
No, a pg version, maybe.

24:02.308 --> 24:05.276
Real djinn are said to be
very, very powerful demons

24:05.278 --> 24:07.144
made of smokeless,
scorching fire.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.479
Here.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.581
The curse transmits
the symbol of the djinn

24:10.583 --> 24:12.216
onto the flesh who read it.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.785
They are then compelled
to find the djinn's lair...

24:16.621 --> 24:20.758
where it consumes their
life force with his flames.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.494
Alex is on her way to burn and
I could've stopped her just now?

24:23.496 --> 24:24.628
No. No you could not.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.998
Restraining the
cursed is futile.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.670
Jake, had you successfully
held her back...

24:32.672 --> 24:34.205
She would've burst into flames.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.076
You-you said that Jennings
and his crew stopped this thing.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.511
How?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.447
<i>With the city burning,
the vault team knew</i>

24:43.449 --> 24:45.349
<i>that their only hope
of finding the djinn</i>

24:45.351 --> 24:46.684
<i>was for one of its own
to read the pamphlet</i>

24:46.686 --> 24:48.919
<i>and take on its fatal curse.</i>

25:01.032 --> 25:05.469
<i>In the end, the task fell
to Samuel Wilson,</i>

25:05.471 --> 25:07.438
<i>who took the infection
upon himself,</i>

25:07.440 --> 25:10.641
<i>allowing the others to follow
him to the djinn's nest.</i>

25:10.643 --> 25:13.644
Once there, Mr. Jennings used

25:13.646 --> 25:15.312
an ancient Tome
of weather magiks

25:15.314 --> 25:17.481
to summon a powerful tempest.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.216
He flooded the djinn's lair

25:19.218 --> 25:21.519
and struck it down
with unholy lightning.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.154
"The storm that
saved Washington."

25:24.156 --> 25:25.990
The very same. Here.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.858
The white house fire of 1814

25:27.860 --> 25:30.027
was quelled
by a sudden thunderstorm.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.896
A-and uncle Sam.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.131
Did he survive the infection?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.403
Many people have. Remember that.

25:41.239 --> 25:42.673
But...

25:42.675 --> 25:46.644
In this instance, no.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.412
By the time the team arrived,

25:48.414 --> 25:50.714
Wilson had been consumed.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.384
Master Wells.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.085
No. Not...

25:56.888 --> 25:58.556
No, not this time.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.594
No, not today.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.162
Not Alex.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.405
Burn.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.307
You burn...

26:21.713 --> 26:24.315
You must burn for me.

26:26.918 --> 26:31.488
You must join the eternal flame.

26:49.975 --> 26:53.344
I am ready to burn with you.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.354
A good man named August Corbin
showed me this ritual.

27:04.923 --> 27:08.258
He wanted to help guide me,
to show me that even when life

27:08.260 --> 27:09.960
feels like it's spinning
out of control,

27:09.962 --> 27:12.029
I can always find a way back.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.467
But what if I choose
the wrong one?

27:17.435 --> 27:20.270
There is no wrong choice.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.973
All of these paths have value.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.677
Just listen to your heart
and you'll choose true.

27:39.524 --> 27:40.691
What does it mean?

27:40.693 --> 27:43.193
When I did this ceremony,

27:43.195 --> 27:46.330
I picked the crossbow.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.666
Chose the destiny of a warrior.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.935
But the bowl means that the path
laid out before you,

27:51.937 --> 27:53.971
should you choose to walk it,

27:53.973 --> 27:55.372
is that of an oracle.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.841
Someone with insight
into people's minds,

27:57.843 --> 28:00.878
someone able to see
into people's souls

28:00.880 --> 28:03.514
as easily as looking
into a mirror.

28:18.631 --> 28:20.030
Pretty. Be careful.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.498
I know it doesn't
look like much...

28:21.500 --> 28:23.367
Molly? Molly?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.151
Can you hear me?

28:44.589 --> 28:46.590
<i>Molly...</i>

28:46.592 --> 28:48.358
Molly!

28:48.360 --> 28:50.360
Talk to me. Are you okay?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.563
I saw something terrible.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.431
It-it was Mr. crane,

28:54.433 --> 28:57.768
but he was so... he was so old,

28:57.770 --> 29:00.404
and so... and so alone, and...

29:03.541 --> 29:06.210
As soon as we find Alex,
we hit her with this.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.945
It's a special blend
of acetaminophen

29:07.947 --> 29:09.446
and north African wormwood,

29:09.448 --> 29:12.583
courtesy of Jenny's
alternative medicine cabinet.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.052
Should cause a rapid drop
in body temperature.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.286
Very good, agent Thomas.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.855
Master Wells and I

29:17.857 --> 29:19.356
have been busy assembling
the necessaries

29:19.358 --> 29:20.891
to battle the djinn.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.560
Only problem is we still don't
know how to find this thing.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.764
I tried tracing that video
back to its original ip,

29:26.766 --> 29:28.398
you know, find the djinn
at its source code,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.434
but whoever hacked Logan
MacDonald's account

29:30.436 --> 29:32.402
knows their stuff.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.638
Which is why I must
take the curse

29:34.640 --> 29:37.608
upon myself and lead you there.

29:37.610 --> 29:41.478
Just as Mr. Samuel Wilson did
many years ago.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.780
Crane, we can't let you do that.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.281
I am a witness,

29:44.283 --> 29:47.050
a title that has never been
more apropos.

29:50.889 --> 29:54.558
I have a responsibility.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.562
To witness this curse,
to ward off evil,

29:58.564 --> 30:02.099
and to ensure that none
of you become casualties

30:02.101 --> 30:05.369
of a supernatural war
you did not choose to fight.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.910
So.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.446
I'm sorry, Mr. crane,

30:16.448 --> 30:18.782
but... I made my own choice,

30:18.784 --> 30:22.553
and I'm pretty sure
you're not gonna like it.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.857
You already watched it.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.325
Just 20 minutes ago.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.762
Jake..

30:31.764 --> 30:33.163
Why would you do that?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.032
We could've found anyone
who was infected

30:35.034 --> 30:36.700
and put a GPS on their ankle.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.135
Every second that we waste,

30:38.137 --> 30:40.037
Alex moves one step closer
to those flames,

30:40.039 --> 30:43.774
and this was the fastest way
to track her down.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.611
Besides...

30:49.547 --> 30:52.616
she would've done
the same thing for me.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.852
<i>Samuel Wilson</i>

30:54.854 --> 30:56.186
and the agency of yore

30:56.188 --> 30:58.188
would be most proud of you,
master Wells.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.390
Through your gallantry,
their legacy endures.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.392
There's nothing
gallant about it.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.895
I'm a germophobe with a
supernatural virus inside of me.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.296
I'm scared to death.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.334
But I can't let Alex
go through this alone.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.904
Jake? Jake? Jake?

31:13.906 --> 31:15.906
Stay with us. Can you hear me?

31:15.908 --> 31:17.741
I hear a voice.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.142
The djinn summons him.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.885
I know where Alex is.

31:36.261 --> 31:37.728
You certain this is the place?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.229
Yeah. I know what I saw.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.100
Might be right.
I think I saw this place

31:43.102 --> 31:44.768
on a list
of dreyfuss's holdings.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.937
They're gonna turn it
into a server farm.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.205
What farm?

31:48.207 --> 31:49.573
It's where the Internet happens.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.077
Big place for the djinn
to spread its infection.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.679
Hey, if this thing
takes control of me,

31:55.681 --> 31:57.581
you get Alex out,
no matter what.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.016
We will get both of you out.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.251
No. See, I don't
think you heard me.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.853
If something happens

32:02.855 --> 32:04.888
and I become one of
those infected things,

32:04.890 --> 32:07.124
I want you to forget about me
and you do whatever it takes

32:07.126 --> 32:08.692
to get her to safety, okay?

32:10.795 --> 32:13.964
And, look,
if I don't make it out...

32:13.966 --> 32:17.768
My complete wave one captain
beast smash force action figures

32:17.770 --> 32:20.971
collection must stay mint
in the box forever.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.941
All right? No kid's dirty little
paws can ever touch them.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.175
Understand?

32:26.144 --> 32:28.812
You have my word.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.048
Then let's do this.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.194
There's so many of them.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.999
Alex! You in here?

32:49.001 --> 32:50.500
Alex!

32:57.775 --> 33:01.545
How did a storm
save the city from that?

33:06.351 --> 33:08.852
Master Logan lives.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.163
And Alex!

33:20.165 --> 33:21.398
Alex!

33:27.638 --> 33:28.805
Hey, genie!

33:28.807 --> 33:30.040
Over here!

33:33.177 --> 33:36.680
We will all burn together
in his flames.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.448
Jake?

33:43.821 --> 33:45.722
Jake.!

33:48.159 --> 33:50.394
Crane!

33:50.396 --> 33:53.096
Watch out!

34:02.540 --> 34:04.975
Crane, where are you?

34:27.931 --> 34:29.733
Agent Thomas!

34:29.735 --> 34:32.768
'Tis time to summon
that lightning!

34:32.771 --> 34:34.838
Come.

34:39.777 --> 34:43.179
You must burn for me.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.616
You must join... Jake.

34:46.618 --> 34:49.953
The eternal flame.

34:49.955 --> 34:52.089
Crane, I don't have a shot.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.925
Jake!

34:56.960 --> 34:58.462
Agent Thomas!

35:09.307 --> 35:10.740
Crane, you with me?

35:10.742 --> 35:12.676
Jake? Alex? Somebody talk to me.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.616
We good?

35:19.618 --> 35:20.884
Never better.

35:30.828 --> 35:34.164
I can't... I can't hear
his voice in my head anymore.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.832
You?

35:35.834 --> 35:36.967
No.

35:38.936 --> 35:42.005
I am so never using
a dating app again.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.381
Hey. Hey.

35:53.184 --> 35:57.187
So... you saved me.

35:57.189 --> 36:01.024
Yeah, well, apparently,
you saved me, too.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.463
Sure, but... after you saved me.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.732
Who's splitting hairs?

36:11.702 --> 36:13.703
Thanks, Jake.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.205
You really came through for me.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.873
Did you think I wouldn't?

36:16.875 --> 36:18.708
No, it's not that I didn't.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.845
It's just...
You risked everything for me,

36:21.847 --> 36:25.081
and no one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.619
It's... it's okay.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.389
You'll hit me back, right?

36:32.391 --> 36:37.027
Yeah. I'll hit you back.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.901
Sure you're not
still feeling feverish?

36:44.903 --> 36:46.870
Shut up.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.574
We can come back.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.075
No, we good.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.277
Yeah, no, we're all good.

36:57.582 --> 37:00.083
Where did this come from?

37:00.085 --> 37:02.652
You'd be amazed what this place
has in its storage closet.

37:04.422 --> 37:07.057
Davy Crockett? What did I miss?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.659
Turns out our agency
has a pedigree.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.929
Paul Jennings,
Davy Crockett, sacagawea.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.165
Every one of them is
an American hero,

37:15.167 --> 37:17.567
and they all worked right here
in this room together.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.102
I always thought Daniel Boone

37:19.104 --> 37:20.737
was the one
who wore the fur cap.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.006
Technically, they both did.
Guys, you're missing the point.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.508
We are the occupational

37:25.510 --> 37:27.310
descendent of real heroes.

37:32.950 --> 37:36.553
You don't seem... Yourself.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.288
No, I'm fine, fine.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.528
If I'm honest, agent Thomas...

37:46.864 --> 37:50.033
a heavy burden weighs upon me.

38:00.544 --> 38:03.647
"This letter of
mark and reprisal

38:03.649 --> 38:06.650
"empowers me as first president
of the United States

38:06.652 --> 38:10.353
to appoint captain ichabod crane
commanding officer to..."

38:12.823 --> 38:17.160
George Washington put you
in charge of this agency?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.696
Look at them.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.799
Yeah, for sure.

38:22.801 --> 38:26.403
They are true of heart.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.471
They fought bravely today.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.141
What of tomorrow's battles?

38:31.143 --> 38:33.243
Or the next?

38:33.245 --> 38:34.678
But that's just me.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.114
What if my war on evil...

38:38.116 --> 38:40.483
Leads one of them
to an early grave?

38:42.853 --> 38:44.921
That's just leadership, crane.

38:48.859 --> 38:50.694
Perhaps.

38:50.696 --> 38:54.197
Those decisions should
wait for another day.

38:58.536 --> 38:59.736
Compatriots.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.173
Heroes all.

39:04.141 --> 39:08.712
Might I suggest
we gather for a moment,

39:08.714 --> 39:12.015
and celebrate today's victory
in the great tradition

39:12.017 --> 39:15.185
of 355 agents of yore...

39:15.187 --> 39:18.988
With a commemorative... selfie!

39:18.990 --> 39:21.825
Are we smiling? I never smile.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.561
I'm smiling. Say "prunes."

39:24.563 --> 39:26.229
Who says prunes?
Back in the day,

39:26.231 --> 39:28.732
people did say "prunes"
instead of "cheese."

39:28.734 --> 39:30.700
Yeah, puckered lips were
really cool back then.

39:30.702 --> 39:31.868
I miss normal people.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.104
Prunes! Prunes!

39:37.508 --> 39:39.909
That's good.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.078
It's blurry. You're blurry.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.049
Thank you so much for looking after Molly.
Yeah, of course.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.852
How was it? It was great...

39:48.854 --> 39:51.521
But, we were...

39:51.523 --> 39:55.592
Doing a meditation and she
saw something that scared her.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.696
A vision, and crane was in it,

39:59.698 --> 40:01.197
but he wasn't himself.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.099
He was old,

40:03.101 --> 40:05.702
and tired and very, very afraid.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.070
What does it mean?

40:08.038 --> 40:12.008
I think... something's coming.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.377
Not something, miss Jenny.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.846
Someone.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.215
That server farm...

40:19.217 --> 40:22.619
It's owned by a subsidiary
of dreyfuss enterprises.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.287
We know he summoned
this creature

40:24.289 --> 40:27.090
and ravaged our noble city
with its pestilence.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.760
The only question remaining...

40:30.762 --> 40:33.830
Is why?

40:37.902 --> 40:40.270
Stars.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.606
Stars are so passé,

40:43.608 --> 40:46.309
don't you think?

40:46.311 --> 40:50.180
I much prefer the ansa.

40:55.486 --> 40:58.488
Did you know the hindus
used the ansa

40:58.490 --> 41:01.491
to symbolize life after death?

41:01.493 --> 41:04.494
Very nice, Malcolm.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.829
On the downside,

41:05.831 --> 41:08.665
your outbreak
has been contained.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.667
The security footage
at the server farm

41:10.669 --> 41:13.636
shows ichabod crane and his team
managing to infiltrate...

41:13.638 --> 41:15.805
Whoa. Team?

41:15.807 --> 41:18.174
Is that really what you'd call

41:18.176 --> 41:20.810
that merry band of
degenerates, jobe?

41:20.812 --> 41:24.180
I have witnessed
the future in motion,

41:24.182 --> 41:26.516
and there is nothing

41:26.518 --> 41:29.519
that crane and his so-called...

41:29.521 --> 41:32.255
Sorry, what was it again?

41:32.257 --> 41:34.757
Team... Team can do

41:34.759 --> 41:37.360
to stop this future
from unfolding,

41:37.362 --> 41:40.196
now that I am assembling

41:40.198 --> 41:42.532
<i>a team...</i>

41:42.534 --> 41:44.801
Of my own.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.003
I'm afraid you're right, jobe.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.438
Crane...

41:48.440 --> 41:51.140
He did manage
to stop the outbreak,

41:51.142 --> 41:52.976
but not before I got

41:52.978 --> 41:56.045
everything I needed from it.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.019
A hero's welcome

42:03.021 --> 42:04.821
to the man of the hour!

42:06.391 --> 42:09.526
Yes, our very own...

42:09.528 --> 42:11.561
Patient zero.

42:14.899 --> 42:17.834
He who sent the picagram

42:17.836 --> 42:20.403
heard 'round the world.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.572
Every second I feel stronger,

42:22.574 --> 42:25.074
like I'm leaving my body
and becoming something more.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.576
So much more, Logan.

42:26.578 --> 42:29.045
Are the others here yet?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.581
Patience, Patience,
my overzealous millennial.

42:33.018 --> 42:36.753
We're still waiting for a few
more of your brethren to rise.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.321
America...

42:38.323 --> 42:41.691
Wasn't built in a day.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.661
She won't be brought
to her knees in one day, either.
