02:35.060 --> 02:38.927
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his career with CBS.

02:39.731 --> 02:41.391
When World War Two broke out...

02:41.483 --> 02:44.270
...his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us...

02:44.361 --> 02:46.816
...through his "This Is London"
radio series.

02:47.739 --> 02:49.281
He started with us all...

02:49.407 --> 02:52.823
...many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy...

02:52.911 --> 02:55.366
...with the news documentary show,
"See It Now'.

02:55.538 --> 02:57.282
He threw stones at giants.

02:58.374 --> 03:01.624
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers...

03:01.836 --> 03:03.912
...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover...

03:04.797 --> 03:08.925
...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

03:10.052 --> 03:13.671
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...

03:14.390 --> 03:17.177
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...

03:17.643 --> 03:20.977
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...

03:21.313 --> 03:24.398
...inspired, lectured, and taught.

03:25.526 --> 03:26.854
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:26.944 --> 03:31.107
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...

03:31.198 --> 03:33.440
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

03:54.095 --> 03:56.254
This might just do nobody any good.

03:57.140 --> 04:00.888
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...

04:00.977 --> 04:03.183
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...

04:03.605 --> 04:07.139
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...

04:07.233 --> 04:09.605
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

04:10.653 --> 04:12.942
But the elaborate structure
of networks...

04:13.031 --> 04:16.862
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

04:17.743 --> 04:21.159
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...

04:21.247 --> 04:24.782
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio andtelevision.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.833
And if what I say is responsible...

04:27.253 --> 04:29.826
...I alone am responsible
for the saying ofit.

04:31.048 --> 04:33.206
Our history will be
what we make of it.

04:34.093 --> 04:37.675
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...

04:37.763 --> 04:39.387
...and there should be preserved...

04:39.473 --> 04:42.308
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...

04:42.726 --> 04:46.391
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...

04:46.980 --> 04:49.020
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...

04:49.107 --> 04:52.726
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

04:53.278 --> 04:57.062
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

04:57.949 --> 05:01.614
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

05:01.828 --> 05:04.034
Our mass media reflect this.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.412
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...

05:07.500 --> 05:09.956
...and recognize
that television in the main...

05:10.044 --> 05:14.256
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...

05:14.757 --> 05:17.046
...then television
and those who finance it...

05:17.135 --> 05:20.052
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...

05:20.388 --> 05:22.961
...may see atotally
different picture too late.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.139
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

06:22.949 --> 06:25.107
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

06:25.201 --> 06:26.316
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

06:26.411 --> 06:28.237
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

06:28.329 --> 06:31.449
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

06:33.543 --> 06:34.705
Morning, Johnny!

06:34.794 --> 06:37.914
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

06:38.005 --> 06:39.250
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.543
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...

06:42.635 --> 06:45.422
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

06:45.513 --> 06:46.841
- Yes.
- Thank you.

06:47.181 --> 06:48.212
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

06:49.767 --> 06:52.139
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

06:52.227 --> 06:54.137
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

06:54.229 --> 06:55.510
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.100
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

06:57.191 --> 06:59.978
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

07:04.615 --> 07:05.860
Let me see this.

07:09.494 --> 07:13.112
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

07:13.373 --> 07:14.867
You promise to be a loyal American?

07:14.958 --> 07:17.116
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

07:17.210 --> 07:18.918
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

07:19.004 --> 07:20.996
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

07:21.089 --> 07:22.464
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

07:23.925 --> 07:25.668
Are you now
or have you ever been...

07:25.760 --> 07:28.002
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

07:28.096 --> 07:30.634
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

07:30.723 --> 07:32.930
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

07:33.017 --> 07:36.600
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

07:36.687 --> 07:39.013
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

07:39.107 --> 07:41.432
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

07:41.526 --> 07:44.692
- Maybe you should talk toMurrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

07:45.863 --> 07:48.650
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

07:50.951 --> 07:52.909
If I don'tsign it,
they'll fire me.

07:59.376 --> 08:00.372
Sign it.

08:00.794 --> 08:02.953
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

08:04.256 --> 08:07.672
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...

08:08.051 --> 08:12.429
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...

08:13.015 --> 08:16.383
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

08:17.394 --> 08:19.433
'Yes, 'tis but a violet..."

08:20.397 --> 08:21.891
"...glistening with dew."

08:22.899 --> 08:26.434
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

08:27.529 --> 08:29.189
"So in our heart..."

08:30.615 --> 08:32.193
"...our love for you..."

08:33.201 --> 08:35.774
"...lies unrevealed."

08:38.289 --> 08:39.404
I used to...

08:45.588 --> 08:50.582
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...

08:52.386 --> 08:58.590
...especially over the past
19-19 months, when we've been...

08:59.226 --> 09:02.263
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

09:03.564 --> 09:04.892
I didnt think that...

09:07.192 --> 09:10.193
...I could be... touched very deeply.

09:10.404 --> 09:12.646
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

09:12.739 --> 09:14.779
- It's short.
- Howlong is the piece?

09:14.867 --> 09:16.610
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

09:16.702 --> 09:19.489
It cant stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.905
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

09:21.999 --> 09:25.332
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...

09:25.419 --> 09:28.538
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...

09:28.630 --> 09:31.086
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

09:31.174 --> 09:34.424
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

09:34.511 --> 09:37.084
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...

09:37.180 --> 09:40.513
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.933
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

09:44.020 --> 09:47.140
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Frankin...

09:47.231 --> 09:48.476
...than with Mr. Hoover.

09:48.566 --> 09:51.022
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

09:51.110 --> 09:53.566
"At home with Ben Frankin.
His electricity awards."

09:53.654 --> 09:55.564
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

09:55.656 --> 09:59.357
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

09:59.452 --> 10:01.195
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.

10:01.287 --> 10:03.825
- New York Times? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

10:03.914 --> 10:06.619
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...

10:06.834 --> 10:10.417
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

10:10.504 --> 10:13.173
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not a nobit piece.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.878
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

10:16.343 --> 10:18.668
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...

10:18.762 --> 10:22.676
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...

10:22.766 --> 10:24.723
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...

10:24.810 --> 10:27.561
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.184
Can you take this?

10:29.272 --> 10:31.846
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...

10:31.942 --> 10:35.441
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...

10:35.529 --> 10:37.936
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

10:38.031 --> 10:40.154
May I finish?
It's national security!

10:40.241 --> 10:43.029
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

10:43.536 --> 10:47.914
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

10:48.750 --> 10:52.083
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

10:52.879 --> 10:55.500
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

10:55.590 --> 10:58.128
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

10:59.719 --> 11:00.917
Thank you, John.

11:01.846 --> 11:03.221
There's notmuch there.

11:03.347 --> 11:06.847
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

11:07.143 --> 11:10.512
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

11:11.897 --> 11:15.147
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.977
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

11:19.572 --> 11:23.320
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...

11:23.409 --> 11:28.035
...reads ome Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.948
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

11:30.749 --> 11:33.370
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.746
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...

11:36.838 --> 11:38.582
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...

11:38.673 --> 11:41.959
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

11:42.052 --> 11:44.507
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

11:46.223 --> 11:49.888
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.265
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

11:52.979 --> 11:53.975
No.

11:55.106 --> 11:56.481
Then it's not McCarthy.

11:58.109 --> 11:59.105
Isn't it?

12:05.199 --> 12:06.741
Milo Radulovich.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.407
What happens to your children...

12:12.498 --> 12:15.416
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

12:15.501 --> 12:18.455
If I am being judged
on my relatives...

12:19.463 --> 12:24.540
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

12:24.635 --> 12:28.680
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

12:29.390 --> 12:34.384
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

12:34.478 --> 12:36.803
...why their father
is a security risk?

12:37.773 --> 12:42.435
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...

12:42.736 --> 12:46.947
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...

12:47.741 --> 12:50.030
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.036
Well, that's new.

12:59.252 --> 13:00.877
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

13:00.962 --> 13:04.248
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.918
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

13:06.009 --> 13:09.045
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...

13:09.137 --> 13:10.382
...both sides, no commentary.

13:10.471 --> 13:13.472
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...

13:13.558 --> 13:15.218
We're giving them
the information up front...

13:15.309 --> 13:16.887
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.

13:16.978 --> 13:18.009
Frank, hold on.

13:18.771 --> 13:20.431
I've searched my conscience.

13:20.606 --> 13:23.809
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

13:23.901 --> 13:26.772
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...

13:26.862 --> 13:28.902
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

13:28.989 --> 13:31.943
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

13:32.034 --> 13:33.742
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

13:33.827 --> 13:35.903
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

13:35.996 --> 13:38.950
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...

13:39.041 --> 13:40.072
Do me a favor...

13:40.167 --> 13:43.500
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

13:43.587 --> 13:44.785
Please, don't insult me.

13:45.339 --> 13:49.467
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...

13:49.968 --> 13:52.293
...and also have
some military contracts...

13:52.387 --> 13:55.590
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...

13:55.682 --> 13:57.722
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

13:57.809 --> 14:00.929
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

14:01.021 --> 14:04.390
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

14:04.482 --> 14:07.982
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

14:09.779 --> 14:13.029
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

14:13.616 --> 14:14.647
Excuse me.

14:22.834 --> 14:25.585
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

14:26.087 --> 14:28.163
I've got a great story about Hoover.

14:32.134 --> 14:34.590
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...

14:34.678 --> 14:37.763
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

14:37.848 --> 14:39.924
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

14:45.022 --> 14:46.564
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

14:49.151 --> 14:50.978
Alcoa wont pay for the ads.

14:51.987 --> 14:55.652
And we probably wont either.
But nobody'll stop you.

14:55.741 --> 14:56.903
How much are the ads?

14:59.161 --> 15:02.327
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

15:03.915 --> 15:07.249
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

15:07.586 --> 15:10.789
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

15:19.973 --> 15:22.973
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

15:23.059 --> 15:26.344
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

15:26.437 --> 15:29.474
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

15:29.565 --> 15:31.309
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

15:31.400 --> 15:36.062
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...

15:36.155 --> 15:39.856
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

15:39.950 --> 15:43.651
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...

15:43.746 --> 15:45.121
...not to approve it.

15:45.748 --> 15:48.784
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...

15:48.876 --> 15:51.414
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...

15:51.503 --> 15:54.077
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...

15:54.173 --> 15:57.838
...without his Constitutional rights...
- You have not seen the evidence...

15:57.926 --> 16:00.251
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

16:00.345 --> 16:04.473
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...

16:04.558 --> 16:08.602
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

16:08.687 --> 16:12.020
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

16:12.107 --> 16:14.680
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

16:14.776 --> 16:17.445
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

16:17.696 --> 16:21.942
Or you, Colonel Jenkns? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

16:22.951 --> 16:28.490
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

16:29.082 --> 16:32.367
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

16:32.877 --> 16:35.997
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...

16:36.380 --> 16:39.050
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

16:39.717 --> 16:43.168
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

16:49.268 --> 16:55.140
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had noday in court.

16:55.566 --> 16:59.694
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...

16:59.903 --> 17:04.445
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...

17:04.532 --> 17:06.526
...as this thing has developed.

17:06.827 --> 17:09.614
- Now this whole theory...
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

17:09.704 --> 17:11.662
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

17:11.748 --> 17:15.117
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

17:15.210 --> 17:16.490
He's on his way
to the control room.

17:16.586 --> 17:18.246
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.128
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

17:20.214 --> 17:21.460
Booth is there, it's already set.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.756
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.670
That's not what I asked for.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.304
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

17:29.391 --> 17:31.513
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

17:31.601 --> 17:34.353
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

17:34.437 --> 17:35.718
Get himout of the booth!

17:39.275 --> 17:41.481
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

17:42.653 --> 17:45.358
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.770
2 minutes to air, fellas.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.534
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

17:53.414 --> 17:56.747
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.835
- As long as he talks fast because...
- He will talk fast.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.129
We got the film.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.589
Will it be ready?

18:09.096 --> 18:10.127
You bet.

18:16.103 --> 18:17.348
Funny thing, Freddy!

18:17.813 --> 18:21.098
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

18:35.705 --> 18:38.623
It occurs t ome
we might not get away with this one.

18:45.006 --> 18:48.042
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...

18:48.134 --> 18:50.292
- 10 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

18:50.553 --> 18:51.833
Ready on camera 1.

18:58.811 --> 19:03.105
5, 4,3, 2.

19:05.985 --> 19:07.230
Pan, camera 1.

19:08.779 --> 19:09.775
Good evening.

19:10.239 --> 19:13.904
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...

19:13.993 --> 19:15.784
...about Milo Radulovich...

19:16.161 --> 19:18.368
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

19:18.705 --> 19:22.370
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...

19:23.252 --> 19:26.834
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...

19:26.922 --> 19:30.172
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...

19:30.258 --> 19:32.963
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

19:33.887 --> 19:37.422
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

19:37.682 --> 19:39.889
A board was called
and heard his case.

19:39.976 --> 19:43.594
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...

19:43.688 --> 19:47.104
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...

19:47.192 --> 19:49.018
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

19:49.152 --> 19:51.559
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...

19:51.654 --> 19:53.777
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

19:53.990 --> 19:56.777
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

19:57.702 --> 20:00.703
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.

20:01.122 --> 20:04.407
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...

20:04.500 --> 20:06.457
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

20:06.627 --> 20:09.877
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

20:10.005 --> 20:11.381
They weren't too pleased.

20:12.258 --> 20:14.215
You're gonna get audited this year.

20:14.593 --> 20:17.760
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

20:19.056 --> 20:21.677
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

20:28.815 --> 20:29.930
In 10 seconds.

20:34.404 --> 20:37.026
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

20:37.407 --> 20:40.574
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

20:40.786 --> 20:45.578
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...

20:45.665 --> 20:48.619
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

20:49.127 --> 20:54.287
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

20:54.382 --> 20:58.510
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

20:58.970 --> 21:03.881
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

21:04.016 --> 21:06.056
...why their father
is a security risk?

21:06.978 --> 21:11.889
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

21:12.275 --> 21:16.568
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...

21:16.654 --> 21:20.948
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...

21:21.033 --> 21:24.484
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.455
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...

21:28.540 --> 21:31.660
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

21:32.086 --> 21:34.837
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...

21:34.922 --> 21:38.006
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...

21:38.091 --> 21:40.084
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

21:41.386 --> 21:44.886
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...

21:44.973 --> 21:48.307
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...

21:48.393 --> 21:52.438
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.

21:53.148 --> 21:56.314
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...

21:56.568 --> 22:00.612
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

22:00.947 --> 22:02.145
We do not know.

22:02.991 --> 22:06.276
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

22:06.411 --> 22:09.910
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

22:10.957 --> 22:14.242
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...

22:14.335 --> 22:18.249
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...

22:18.339 --> 22:20.794
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...

22:20.883 --> 22:23.291
...in attempting to protect
the national security...

22:23.386 --> 22:26.137
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

22:27.223 --> 22:29.927
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...

22:30.017 --> 22:32.140
...between the individual
and the state...

22:32.228 --> 22:33.805
...we will do it ourselves...

22:34.355 --> 22:38.815
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

22:39.568 --> 22:42.901
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...

22:43.405 --> 22:46.904
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.367
Good night, and good luck.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.415
And we'reout.

24:34.305 --> 24:34.722
May I tell you something
about yourself...

24:34.722 --> 24:36.430
May I tellyou something
about yourself...

24:36.515 --> 24:38.923
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

24:39.018 --> 24:41.094
Based on audience
research studies...

24:41.645 --> 24:45.228
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

24:45.816 --> 24:48.983
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...

24:49.153 --> 24:50.979
...to sports and show business.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.530
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...

24:54.616 --> 24:58.531
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

24:59.288 --> 25:02.123
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...

25:02.207 --> 25:04.365
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow'sprogram...

25:04.459 --> 25:06.001
...to tell you about Kent.

25:06.253 --> 25:11.330
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filter's best.

25:11.591 --> 25:14.711
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...

25:14.803 --> 25:18.006
...with many other thinking people
who havec hanged to Kent.

25:18.348 --> 25:23.259
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

25:24.229 --> 25:27.514
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...

25:27.607 --> 25:31.439
...on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

25:31.527 --> 25:33.105
Now back to Ed Murrow.

25:34.363 --> 25:37.281
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...

25:37.366 --> 25:41.115
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

25:41.621 --> 25:45.286
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...

25:45.458 --> 25:49.289
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

25:49.753 --> 25:53.004
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...

25:53.090 --> 25:56.424
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

25:56.593 --> 26:00.461
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

26:01.098 --> 26:04.348
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

26:05.352 --> 26:07.510
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

26:07.604 --> 26:12.349
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...

26:12.818 --> 26:19.354
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

26:19.449 --> 26:21.821
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

26:21.910 --> 26:24.911
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

26:24.996 --> 26:27.617
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...

26:27.707 --> 26:31.621
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

26:31.711 --> 26:34.416
I want to someday
find the perfect mate...

26:34.797 --> 26:38.877
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...

26:39.010 --> 26:41.631
...by faith
and will be a lasting union.

26:42.138 --> 26:46.883
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...

26:47.435 --> 26:50.104
...and she's lookng
for her dream man, too...

26:50.688 --> 26:52.680
...and I hope she finds him someday.

26:54.066 --> 26:57.815
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

26:57.903 --> 26:59.066
It's been very pleasant.

26:59.155 --> 27:01.313
And will you say goodnight
to your family for us?

27:01.407 --> 27:03.115
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.027
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

27:06.495 --> 27:09.247
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...

27:09.331 --> 27:12.000
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his newbride.

27:12.084 --> 27:14.753
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.592
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

27:45.783 --> 27:47.028
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

27:47.118 --> 27:49.823
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

27:49.912 --> 27:53.032
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

27:53.124 --> 27:55.163
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

27:55.251 --> 27:57.457
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

27:57.545 --> 28:00.415
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

28:00.506 --> 28:03.175
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

28:05.010 --> 28:06.339
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

28:07.388 --> 28:08.798
You're getting good at this!

28:09.348 --> 28:11.139
They're gonna think you like it!

28:11.308 --> 28:13.597
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

28:14.895 --> 28:15.926
Ah, it's...

28:17.397 --> 28:18.596
...day today.

28:19.358 --> 28:22.275
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.228
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

28:27.741 --> 28:30.944
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

28:31.787 --> 28:34.360
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

28:35.457 --> 28:38.292
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

28:38.585 --> 28:41.502
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

28:42.047 --> 28:43.706
Well, see, I rest my case.

28:45.425 --> 28:49.672
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

28:52.849 --> 28:53.963
Thanks, Ed.

28:55.309 --> 28:58.595
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

28:58.688 --> 29:01.891
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.895
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

29:07.488 --> 29:10.524
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.491
You let me know if I can help.

29:12.701 --> 29:14.160
But you're a pinko.

29:16.914 --> 29:18.159
I'll see you.

29:34.139 --> 29:36.808
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?

29:36.892 --> 29:39.809
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.

29:39.895 --> 29:41.223
What would you say if I told you...

29:41.313 --> 29:43.886
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

29:46.067 --> 29:49.152
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

29:51.281 --> 29:52.905
McCarthy going
tot he Eisenhower dinner?

29:52.991 --> 29:56.573
- I have no idea. Id on't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

30:00.707 --> 30:04.407
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

30:04.502 --> 30:06.625
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

30:06.712 --> 30:09.879
I didnt know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

30:09.966 --> 30:13.548
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

30:13.928 --> 30:15.422
No pun elocuted.

30:18.891 --> 30:20.884
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

30:21.143 --> 30:23.895
Murrows been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

30:23.979 --> 30:27.514
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...

30:27.608 --> 30:30.146
...and on the Sovietpayroll
in 1935. It's all there.

30:30.235 --> 30:32.109
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

30:32.196 --> 30:33.690
Why you'll lose this one?

30:34.156 --> 30:36.148
Because everyone in this country...

30:36.241 --> 30:39.361
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's apatriot.

30:41.330 --> 30:44.081
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

30:44.166 --> 30:47.166
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

30:50.255 --> 30:51.797
I think you guys go too far.

30:52.173 --> 30:54.499
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

31:01.349 --> 31:02.677
Yes, Mr. Paley.

31:03.685 --> 31:05.309
Right away.
Yes, sir.

31:07.021 --> 31:08.480
No, he hasn't called.

31:09.774 --> 31:13.606
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?

31:14.946 --> 31:16.819
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

31:19.575 --> 31:20.654
Mr. Murrow!

31:21.535 --> 31:23.279
Mr. Paley will see you now.

31:27.124 --> 31:30.873
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

31:31.462 --> 31:34.249
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

31:35.090 --> 31:36.169
How's Janet?

31:36.592 --> 31:38.999
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

31:39.136 --> 31:42.303
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...

31:42.723 --> 31:45.593
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

31:47.144 --> 31:48.389
You'd never know.

31:52.274 --> 31:53.554
Reading fiction?

31:54.192 --> 31:56.066
I hope so. You tell me.

31:57.487 --> 31:59.314
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

31:59.406 --> 32:02.323
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

32:02.409 --> 32:05.030
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

32:07.330 --> 32:10.201
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

32:11.042 --> 32:14.956
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

32:15.380 --> 32:19.591
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

32:21.344 --> 32:23.502
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

32:23.596 --> 32:26.051
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...

32:26.140 --> 32:27.634
...and that the News
was to be left...

32:27.725 --> 32:29.516
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

32:29.602 --> 32:32.353
He's marked as Communists.

32:32.438 --> 32:34.477
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...

32:34.565 --> 32:35.561
...and we will report on that.

32:35.649 --> 32:38.935
He oversteps people's civil liberties.

32:39.028 --> 32:40.142
And you're trying him in the press?

32:40.237 --> 32:42.230
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

32:42.323 --> 32:44.813
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

32:44.908 --> 32:47.234
- What I am doing...
- I write your check.

32:47.327 --> 32:51.195
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

32:51.582 --> 32:55.200
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

33:06.721 --> 33:10.589
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

33:10.809 --> 33:15.387
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.

33:15.522 --> 33:19.305
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...

33:19.442 --> 33:23.060
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

33:23.154 --> 33:26.570
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...

33:26.657 --> 33:29.991
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

33:31.287 --> 33:32.567
Yes?

33:38.044 --> 33:41.412
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

33:42.506 --> 33:44.298
And we'regonna go right at him.

33:44.925 --> 33:47.712
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

33:47.803 --> 33:50.970
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

33:51.056 --> 33:53.263
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...

33:53.350 --> 33:57.182
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...

33:57.271 --> 33:59.144
...if you attended a party,
anything...

33:59.231 --> 34:02.397
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...

34:02.859 --> 34:05.185
...because now would be
the time to tell us.

34:10.659 --> 34:12.650
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.079
Palmer, you kidding?

34:16.039 --> 34:18.577
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...

34:18.666 --> 34:21.751
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

34:21.835 --> 34:24.790
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

34:25.340 --> 34:28.340
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

34:29.844 --> 34:32.797
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...

34:32.889 --> 34:34.347
...somebody'll find out.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.553
They'll hurt us with it.

34:39.103 --> 34:41.559
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

34:42.690 --> 34:43.804
Fred.

34:47.027 --> 34:49.697
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...

34:49.905 --> 34:52.063
...or had a friend
who was "different"...

34:52.157 --> 34:54.827
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...

34:54.909 --> 34:57.745
...we'd all be the kindof people
Joe McCarthy wants.

34:59.706 --> 35:03.325
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.628
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

35:09.716 --> 35:13.630
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

35:14.638 --> 35:16.262
Okay, fellas, here we go.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.841
His own words,
that's what we need.

35:18.934 --> 35:21.471
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...

35:21.561 --> 35:24.562
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General..."

35:24.647 --> 35:26.973
"...you should be removed
from any command."

35:27.484 --> 35:31.267
"Any man who says, "I will protect
and honor a General'..."

35:31.529 --> 35:35.858
"...'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

35:36.159 --> 35:37.783
Ethically, we're fine.

35:37.952 --> 35:41.701
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

35:41.789 --> 35:44.197
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

35:44.292 --> 35:47.707
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

35:47.795 --> 35:49.170
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

35:49.255 --> 35:51.294
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...

35:51.757 --> 35:53.880
...scream and cry about our methods...

35:55.094 --> 35:57.133
...of trying to drag the truth...

35:58.722 --> 36:00.881
...from those who know
or should know...

36:01.725 --> 36:04.679
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

36:05.562 --> 36:06.938
But they say, "Oh..."

36:07.940 --> 36:11.937
"...it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

36:14.029 --> 36:18.572
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

36:19.409 --> 36:21.201
I had many offers of attorneys...

36:21.286 --> 36:25.200
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The question is:

36:25.290 --> 36:28.244
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

36:28.335 --> 36:30.908
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

36:31.046 --> 36:32.041
The answer is yes.

36:32.130 --> 36:34.621
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...

36:34.716 --> 36:37.919
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

36:38.428 --> 36:40.385
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

36:41.806 --> 36:43.134
I know this was in 1932.

36:43.224 --> 36:45.382
Do you know that they since
have been listed...

36:45.476 --> 36:48.014
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

36:48.104 --> 36:50.346
I do not know
that they have been listedso, sir.

36:50.439 --> 36:52.812
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned...

36:52.900 --> 36:54.145
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

36:54.235 --> 36:58.019
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

36:58.114 --> 37:00.439
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

37:00.533 --> 37:02.940
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

37:03.035 --> 37:04.613
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

37:04.703 --> 37:07.029
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

37:07.122 --> 37:08.320
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

37:08.415 --> 37:10.787
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

37:10.876 --> 37:12.703
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

37:12.795 --> 37:15.630
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

37:15.881 --> 37:17.256
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

37:17.591 --> 37:19.749
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.089
Did you finish your closing piece?

37:25.849 --> 37:27.047
It's Shakespeare.

37:28.935 --> 37:30.264
Write your closing.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.090
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...

38:02.176 --> 38:03.718
...it doesn't make any difference.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.091
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.211
If you don't, you'll love it.

38:07.306 --> 38:09.299
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

38:09.391 --> 38:10.886
I don't think
wec an take that chance.

38:10.976 --> 38:13.598
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

38:15.356 --> 38:18.725
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the AIsops or Herb Block.

38:18.942 --> 38:21.730
Honey, the AIsops and Herb Block...

38:22.404 --> 38:26.069
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.

38:26.867 --> 38:28.242
Then I guess it's time.

38:35.542 --> 38:36.538
You worried?

38:39.337 --> 38:40.713
I didn't think I was.

38:41.381 --> 38:44.002
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

38:44.342 --> 38:47.379
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.926
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

38:50.140 --> 38:55.347
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...

38:55.687 --> 38:58.557
...tosee who was listening.
- And who was listening?

39:00.400 --> 39:01.598
Chairman Mao...

39:07.907 --> 39:09.366
I'll see you at the office.

39:10.326 --> 39:11.950
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

39:15.247 --> 39:16.706
Name me another wife...

39:17.166 --> 39:19.918
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...

39:20.002 --> 39:23.205
...before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

39:30.554 --> 39:34.302
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

39:36.393 --> 39:40.011
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

39:40.355 --> 39:42.229
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

39:42.524 --> 39:45.940
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.433
Are you interested?

39:48.280 --> 39:51.233
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

39:51.533 --> 39:52.529
Is that tonight?

39:54.244 --> 39:55.524
We're covered, Bill.

39:56.454 --> 39:57.533
All right.

39:59.457 --> 40:04.166
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

40:19.935 --> 40:22.224
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

40:23.773 --> 40:25.682
Can we hold all the calls, please?

40:25.941 --> 40:28.148
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

40:28.569 --> 40:30.692
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

40:31.030 --> 40:33.817
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

40:49.714 --> 40:50.995
10 seconds.

40:55.303 --> 40:59.882
5, 4,3, 2.

41:01.267 --> 41:02.726
And pan, camera one.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.848
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...

41:10.276 --> 41:12.601
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...

41:12.695 --> 41:15.447
...and request your permission
to read from a script...

41:15.531 --> 41:18.069
...what ever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

41:18.618 --> 41:22.402
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...

41:22.496 --> 41:24.738
...and desires to answer himself...

41:24.915 --> 41:27.786
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.784
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

41:31.505 --> 41:33.165
..."If this fight
against Communism..."

41:33.257 --> 41:36.590
"...has made a fight between
America's two great political parties..."

41:36.677 --> 41:40.176
"...the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed..."

41:40.264 --> 41:43.715
"...and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

41:44.184 --> 41:45.762
We applaud that statement...

41:45.853 --> 41:48.094
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

41:48.313 --> 41:50.638
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

41:51.692 --> 41:55.061
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...

41:55.195 --> 41:57.816
...between America's
two great political parties.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.530
If this fight against Communism...

41:59.616 --> 42:02.819
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...

42:02.911 --> 42:06.529
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...

42:06.623 --> 42:10.039
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

42:10.877 --> 42:13.498
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

42:14.047 --> 42:17.380
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...

42:17.467 --> 42:19.673
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...

42:20.178 --> 42:22.217
...accused civilian
and military leaders...

42:22.305 --> 42:24.760
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...

42:24.849 --> 42:26.842
...to turn over the country
to Communism.

42:26.934 --> 42:31.347
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...

42:31.856 --> 42:36.185
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...

42:36.694 --> 42:39.267
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

42:39.488 --> 42:42.406
As I read his statement, I...

42:43.367 --> 42:46.368
...thought of that quotation,
"On what meat..."

42:47.121 --> 42:49.279
"...does this our Caesar feed?".

42:49.415 --> 42:50.410
The questions is:

42:50.499 --> 42:53.535
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

42:53.627 --> 42:56.200
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

42:56.296 --> 42:57.292
The answer is yes.

42:57.381 --> 43:00.132
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

43:00.342 --> 43:01.753
Its publication...

43:02.844 --> 43:05.549
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?

43:05.847 --> 43:09.181
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...

43:09.684 --> 43:14.062
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...

43:14.481 --> 43:16.307
You can go back
to the publisher...

43:16.399 --> 43:20.064
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

43:20.153 --> 43:22.311
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

43:22.614 --> 43:25.817
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.

43:26.701 --> 43:27.816
I'll say that.

43:28.494 --> 43:32.195
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

43:32.290 --> 43:33.535
Twice he said...

43:33.791 --> 43:37.658
...'The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

43:37.753 --> 43:40.754
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...

43:40.840 --> 43:43.675
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...

43:43.759 --> 43:46.001
...or any other
federal government agency.

43:46.345 --> 43:49.465
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...

43:49.557 --> 43:52.178
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...

43:52.268 --> 43:54.889
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

43:55.938 --> 44:00.398
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

44:00.692 --> 44:03.397
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...

44:03.487 --> 44:07.069
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

44:07.157 --> 44:11.451
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

44:12.162 --> 44:14.404
No one familiar with the history
of this country...

44:14.498 --> 44:17.202
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

44:17.292 --> 44:20.162
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...

44:20.253 --> 44:23.836
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...

44:23.923 --> 44:27.791
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

44:27.969 --> 44:30.542
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

44:31.139 --> 44:34.223
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...

44:34.517 --> 44:38.266
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

44:39.230 --> 44:41.519
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

44:41.607 --> 44:44.478
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...

44:44.569 --> 44:47.238
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...

44:47.446 --> 44:50.732
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...

44:50.908 --> 44:54.443
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...

44:54.537 --> 44:57.952
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

44:58.540 --> 45:01.909
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...

45:02.002 --> 45:04.576
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

45:05.297 --> 45:07.835
Wec an deny our heritage
and our history...

45:07.925 --> 45:10.712
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

45:11.303 --> 45:13.592
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...

45:13.680 --> 45:17.630
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...

45:17.726 --> 45:21.225
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

45:21.855 --> 45:24.180
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...

45:24.274 --> 45:27.275
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...

45:27.360 --> 45:29.898
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

45:30.530 --> 45:33.447
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

45:33.908 --> 45:36.233
He didn't create
this situation of fear...

45:36.494 --> 45:39.495
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.369
Cassius was right.

45:42.917 --> 45:47.294
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

45:48.297 --> 45:50.373
Good night, and good luck.

45:58.099 --> 45:59.213
And we're out.

46:12.863 --> 46:13.894
Nothing?

46:17.117 --> 46:18.611
Maybe nobody watched.

46:23.707 --> 46:26.079
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

46:26.585 --> 46:29.158
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

46:30.672 --> 46:33.044
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.958
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...

46:36.720 --> 46:38.344
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

46:38.430 --> 46:40.173
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

46:40.265 --> 46:43.515
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

46:43.601 --> 46:46.602
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...

46:46.688 --> 46:49.392
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...

46:49.482 --> 46:51.107
...with what Ed Murrow
has just said...

46:51.192 --> 46:53.944
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

46:56.823 --> 47:00.903
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...

47:05.706 --> 47:09.620
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...

47:09.877 --> 47:11.668
...the national policy...

47:14.340 --> 47:16.498
- Is that Hollenbeck?
- Congratulations!

47:16.592 --> 47:17.623
Great show!

47:18.469 --> 47:19.749
Feel like a Scotch?

47:20.345 --> 47:22.421
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

48:14.106 --> 48:17.309
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

48:17.401 --> 48:19.061
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...

48:19.153 --> 48:22.107
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

48:22.197 --> 48:24.155
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

48:26.785 --> 48:28.694
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

49:01.069 --> 49:02.895
Okay. Here we go.

49:03.488 --> 49:06.405
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

49:06.532 --> 49:07.564
- First?
- Good.

49:08.242 --> 49:10.069
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

49:10.620 --> 49:11.948
Gould...

49:12.455 --> 49:15.954
Edward R. Murrows television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...

49:16.042 --> 49:19.873
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

49:19.962 --> 49:23.497
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

49:23.591 --> 49:26.342
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...

49:26.427 --> 49:30.211
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

49:30.347 --> 49:31.592
The program... Hold on!

49:31.682 --> 49:34.469
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...

49:34.560 --> 49:37.644
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...

49:37.729 --> 49:39.722
...would just go away
and leave them alone.

49:39.815 --> 49:42.769
That was Mr. Murrows
and television's triumph...

49:42.859 --> 49:44.402
...and a very great one.

49:47.781 --> 49:48.896
Here! Here!

49:49.074 --> 49:51.197
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

49:51.827 --> 49:53.700
Send the New YorkTimes
abottle of Scotch.

49:53.787 --> 49:55.826
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

49:55.914 --> 49:57.871
- How's the Post?
- Pretty good!

49:58.583 --> 50:00.576
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

50:02.087 --> 50:05.123
- Goon, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

50:05.215 --> 50:06.673
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

50:08.927 --> 50:10.800
- There we go.
- Shirley, that...

50:14.432 --> 50:18.015
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrows "Hate McCarthy" telecast...

50:18.102 --> 50:21.056
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...

50:21.147 --> 50:24.480
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...

50:24.567 --> 50:26.974
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...

50:27.069 --> 50:30.485
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...

50:30.573 --> 50:33.573
...featured Murrow's PM protege,
Hollenbeck.

50:34.326 --> 50:36.698
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...

50:36.787 --> 50:40.238
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...

50:40.332 --> 50:41.661
...from and for the Left.

50:42.835 --> 50:44.033
Soon. Soon...

50:44.128 --> 50:46.250
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

50:46.338 --> 50:49.505
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

50:52.678 --> 50:57.339
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

50:57.432 --> 50:59.140
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...

50:59.226 --> 51:01.432
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

51:01.519 --> 51:05.469
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...

51:05.565 --> 51:09.349
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

51:09.444 --> 51:11.769
He then proceeded
through an equally...

51:13.615 --> 51:15.406
...tilted review of the day's events...

51:15.491 --> 51:18.860
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

51:19.829 --> 51:20.825
Soon.

51:23.624 --> 51:26.542
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

51:27.003 --> 51:30.039
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

51:31.590 --> 51:34.627
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.

51:34.802 --> 51:37.091
Joe... Shirley...

51:42.017 --> 51:43.298
It doesn't matter.

51:48.565 --> 51:49.680
To Jack Gould!

51:50.818 --> 51:53.688
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

51:53.779 --> 51:54.775
I love Jack Gould!

51:56.740 --> 51:58.282
May he rest in peace.

52:00.494 --> 52:03.329
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.494
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

52:06.583 --> 52:08.457
All the adguys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

52:08.543 --> 52:10.536
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.

52:10.629 --> 52:12.004
We're putting out a press release...

52:12.088 --> 52:14.959
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

52:15.050 --> 52:17.422
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

52:17.719 --> 52:21.052
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...

52:22.056 --> 52:23.171
Mr. Paley...

52:24.267 --> 52:26.425
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

52:31.482 --> 52:32.561
How's your wife?

52:33.025 --> 52:35.184
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

52:35.278 --> 52:38.362
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

52:38.447 --> 52:39.443
It's nice there.

52:40.282 --> 52:41.362
Yes, sir.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.411
Excuse me.

52:49.625 --> 52:53.457
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckey
to do his rebuttal.

52:54.713 --> 52:55.792
I said no.

52:57.591 --> 52:58.622
Yes, sir.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.011
Hey, Johnny!

53:06.266 --> 53:08.508
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

53:08.602 --> 53:11.353
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.312
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

53:13.398 --> 53:15.936
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

53:16.026 --> 53:17.520
Got some very good news.

53:18.153 --> 53:21.237
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

53:21.322 --> 53:23.362
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

53:24.200 --> 53:26.359
I have decided
that it is consistent...

53:26.452 --> 53:29.204
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...

53:29.289 --> 53:32.574
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.

53:32.750 --> 53:36.084
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Fullstop.

53:38.714 --> 53:42.333
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.

53:43.010 --> 53:44.006
Great job!

53:44.095 --> 53:46.004
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

53:46.097 --> 53:48.054
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

53:48.140 --> 53:49.385
This means something.

53:49.475 --> 53:51.053
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

53:51.143 --> 53:55.188
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of...

54:02.196 --> 54:03.191
Palmer!

54:06.283 --> 54:08.322
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

54:11.913 --> 54:12.945
When?

54:13.540 --> 54:14.655
Tomorrow.

54:15.584 --> 54:18.953
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

54:19.045 --> 54:20.077
Any ideas?

54:21.673 --> 54:23.298
Just tell them what you know.

54:23.383 --> 54:26.088
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

54:26.177 --> 54:29.381
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...

54:29.472 --> 54:31.797
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.

54:31.891 --> 54:34.216
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

54:34.310 --> 54:36.267
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

54:36.354 --> 54:37.978
No, sir, never.

54:38.064 --> 54:40.306
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

54:40.400 --> 54:44.184
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

54:44.987 --> 54:50.195
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...

54:50.910 --> 54:54.243
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...

54:54.372 --> 54:57.538
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...

54:57.750 --> 55:00.953
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...

55:01.045 --> 55:03.203
...of Communists
who were paying dues.

55:03.714 --> 55:06.466
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

55:07.343 --> 55:10.213
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...

55:10.387 --> 55:13.886
...or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money...

55:14.933 --> 55:16.760
...to the Communist Party.

55:17.519 --> 55:19.227
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

55:19.396 --> 55:21.519
You've never paid
any dues, payment...

55:21.606 --> 55:23.266
Thank you very much, Leo!

55:24.192 --> 55:26.019
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

55:26.653 --> 55:27.981
Now what is the show?

55:28.071 --> 55:30.823
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

55:30.907 --> 55:33.481
- Or is ither Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

55:33.576 --> 55:36.032
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

55:36.121 --> 55:37.829
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

55:37.914 --> 55:40.535
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...

55:40.625 --> 55:42.333
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...

55:42.418 --> 55:44.162
...and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

55:44.254 --> 55:46.745
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...

55:46.839 --> 55:49.674
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today..."

55:49.759 --> 55:52.297
"...that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room..."

55:52.386 --> 55:54.960
"...who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

55:55.056 --> 55:56.550
It's the front page
of the New York Times.

55:56.641 --> 56:00.306
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...

56:00.394 --> 56:03.348
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...

56:03.439 --> 56:05.063
...he ducks out, leaves...
- Right.

56:05.149 --> 56:08.150
- Heleaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

56:08.235 --> 56:09.813
Get me copies from any newspaper...

56:09.904 --> 56:11.528
...that printed anything
about that assertion.

56:11.614 --> 56:14.947
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

56:15.034 --> 56:18.070
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

56:18.162 --> 56:21.281
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

56:21.373 --> 56:24.409
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

56:24.501 --> 56:26.410
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

56:26.503 --> 56:29.670
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...

56:29.756 --> 56:32.591
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...

56:32.676 --> 56:34.834
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of thechair.

56:34.928 --> 56:37.597
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so...

56:37.681 --> 56:41.548
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.

56:45.355 --> 56:46.635
Thank you, Natalie.

56:51.277 --> 56:54.527
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

56:54.614 --> 56:57.187
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

56:57.283 --> 56:59.774
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

57:03.122 --> 57:05.328
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

57:05.416 --> 57:08.417
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

57:08.502 --> 57:10.993
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

57:11.922 --> 57:12.954
He'll lose.

57:13.382 --> 57:15.007
Not if we're playing bridge.

57:16.719 --> 57:19.589
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.838
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have aminute?

57:22.308 --> 57:25.926
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

57:26.311 --> 57:27.687
We have 4 days...

57:27.938 --> 57:30.429
...to do a 29 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

57:30.524 --> 57:31.983
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

57:32.067 --> 57:33.775
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

57:33.860 --> 57:35.687
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

57:37.572 --> 57:38.652
Thank you, dear.

57:40.408 --> 57:43.113
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

57:43.203 --> 57:45.112
- O'Brian doesn'tmatter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

57:45.205 --> 57:46.996
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

57:47.082 --> 57:48.492
We've got to let that guy have it.

57:48.583 --> 57:51.869
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

57:51.961 --> 57:53.242
I can't defeat them both.

57:54.339 --> 57:57.624
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

58:02.847 --> 58:05.136
Okay. I guess not.

58:06.434 --> 58:07.513
Sorry, Don.

58:21.615 --> 58:23.489
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...

58:23.576 --> 58:26.695
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

58:26.787 --> 58:30.488
- She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...

58:30.582 --> 58:34.247
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...

58:34.336 --> 58:35.499
...so help you God?

58:39.299 --> 58:41.969
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

58:42.344 --> 58:43.672
Annie Lee Moss.

58:44.805 --> 58:46.465
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

58:46.807 --> 58:50.057
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...

58:50.143 --> 58:52.349
...for the information
of your counsel...

58:52.854 --> 58:54.811
...that you are not here because...

58:56.149 --> 59:01.190
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

59:01.321 --> 59:04.820
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

59:06.034 --> 59:09.403
We are rather curious, however,
to kno whow you suddenly...

59:10.705 --> 59:12.116
...were shifted from...

59:14.041 --> 59:17.078
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

59:17.378 --> 59:20.664
I am today much more interested...

59:21.424 --> 59:25.124
...in the handling of your case...

59:25.886 --> 59:29.089
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

59:29.473 --> 59:33.637
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

59:33.978 --> 59:37.062
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

59:37.648 --> 59:39.640
You have been told what the rule is.

59:39.942 --> 59:42.978
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

59:46.657 --> 59:50.405
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...

59:51.286 --> 59:53.492
...1945?
- Yes, sir.

59:54.372 --> 59:58.619
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.038
Yes, I had.

01:00:00.337 --> 01:00:04.666
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...

01:00:05.008 --> 01:00:07.759
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?

01:00:07.844 --> 01:00:09.801
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:13.426
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

01:00:13.725 --> 01:00:15.931
No more than to transmit
the message.

01:00:16.019 --> 01:00:18.391
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

01:00:18.479 --> 01:00:21.184
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

01:00:21.274 --> 01:00:23.895
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

01:00:24.443 --> 01:00:25.724
Do you know the...

01:00:27.738 --> 01:00:29.398
...type of classification...

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.653
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:37.280
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

01:00:37.706 --> 01:00:38.738
I see.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.120
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...

01:00:44.296 --> 01:00:48.341
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...

01:00:48.425 --> 01:00:52.672
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would takeover as Chairman?

01:00:57.643 --> 01:00:59.185
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

01:00:59.269 --> 01:01:02.305
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:06.525
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...

01:01:06.818 --> 01:01:10.353
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...

01:01:10.447 --> 01:01:12.190
...of the Communist Party...

01:01:12.657 --> 01:01:14.946
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

01:01:15.034 --> 01:01:18.368
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...

01:01:19.372 --> 01:01:21.614
...witness who was called
before the Committee...

01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:23.534
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...

01:01:23.626 --> 01:01:26.295
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...

01:01:26.379 --> 01:01:28.418
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

01:01:28.506 --> 01:01:32.753
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:37.046
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:41.055
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...

01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:44.685
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...

01:01:44.772 --> 01:01:48.390
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...

01:01:48.567 --> 01:01:51.853
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

01:01:55.282 --> 01:01:58.568
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

01:01:59.953 --> 01:02:02.705
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:06.124
...by testimony, under oath.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:10.001
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...

01:02:10.088 --> 01:02:11.713
...be stricken from the record.

01:02:11.965 --> 01:02:14.503
I didnt ask that, Mr. Chairman!

01:02:14.593 --> 01:02:17.214
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...

01:02:17.304 --> 01:02:20.507
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:25.141
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...

01:02:25.228 --> 01:02:29.439
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...

01:02:29.524 --> 01:02:34.649
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...

01:02:36.572 --> 01:02:37.901
...evil of it!

01:02:38.199 --> 01:02:41.402
- Well, I'd look at it...
- I don't think it's fair to a witness...

01:02:41.494 --> 01:02:42.952
...to a citizen of this country...

01:02:43.037 --> 01:02:45.113
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...

01:02:45.206 --> 01:02:46.616
...then when they get through, say...

01:02:46.707 --> 01:02:49.661
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

01:02:49.752 --> 01:02:52.457
- The Chair agrees...
- It is not sworn testimony...

01:02:52.546 --> 01:02:56.164
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

01:02:57.843 --> 01:03:01.461
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...

01:03:01.555 --> 01:03:05.884
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

01:03:06.518 --> 01:03:10.981
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

01:03:25.912 --> 01:03:29.992
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:32.208
We labeled it as controversial.

01:03:32.752 --> 01:03:36.417
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

01:03:37.006 --> 01:03:38.548
At that time, we said...

01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:42.630
..."If theSenator believes we havedone
violence to his words or pictures..."

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.294
"...if he desires to speak,
to answer himself..."

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:48.509
"...an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

01:03:48.809 --> 01:03:52.510
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...

01:03:52.605 --> 01:03:56.685
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.266
We agreed.

01:03:58.777 --> 01:04:02.941
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.158
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.986
...on this particular program.

01:04:08.537 --> 01:04:12.487
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:20.252
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:23.583
...devoted his program
to an attack...

01:04:23.677 --> 01:04:26.880
...on the work ofthe US Senate
Investigating Committee...

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:29.512
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.968
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.229
...and those fighting Communists.

01:04:37.649 --> 01:04:40.852
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...

01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:44.445
...is of any great importance
as individuals.

01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:47.026
We are only important...

01:04:47.367 --> 01:04:51.411
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:56.580
Now ordinarily, I wouldnt take time
out from the important work at hand...

01:04:57.335 --> 01:04:58.580
...to answer Murrow.

01:04:59.086 --> 01:05:00.628
However, in this case...

01:05:00.713 --> 01:05:04.497
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...

01:05:05.259 --> 01:05:06.338
...the leader...

01:05:06.635 --> 01:05:11.760
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...

01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:16.227
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

01:05:17.396 --> 01:05:19.353
And I am compelled by the fact...

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:22.264
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...

01:05:22.859 --> 01:05:25.397
...as far back as 20 years ago...

01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:29.487
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.737
For example, the Institute
of International Education...

01:05:33.954 --> 01:05:36.195
...of which he was
the Acting Director...

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:39.744
...was chosen to act
as a representative...

01:05:40.126 --> 01:05:41.786
...by a Soviet agency...

01:05:42.921 --> 01:05:48.342
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.925
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...

01:05:53.014 --> 01:05:55.552
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...

01:05:55.641 --> 01:05:58.429
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.511
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.

01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:05.022
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...

01:06:05.818 --> 01:06:09.519
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..."

01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:14.909
"...have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:19.450
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

01:06:20.207 --> 01:06:25.546
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

01:06:25.879 --> 01:06:27.788
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...

01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:30.333
...is giving comfort to our enemies...

01:06:30.592 --> 01:06:33.048
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...

01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:36.844
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

01:06:36.973 --> 01:06:38.432
And I want to assure you...

01:06:39.559 --> 01:06:42.560
...that I will not be deterred...

01:06:43.313 --> 01:06:49.149
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...

01:06:49.944 --> 01:06:53.894
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

01:06:56.075 --> 01:06:59.195
And I make no claim to leadership.

01:07:01.497 --> 01:07:03.075
Incomplete humility...

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:09.045
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...

01:07:09.755 --> 01:07:11.380
...to join with me.

01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:41.527
[Everyone talks about the weather.]

01:07:42.371 --> 01:07:45.206
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms...]

01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:49.959
[... aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather.]

01:07:50.837 --> 01:07:54.087
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa...]

01:07:54.174 --> 01:07:55.549
[... since 1999...]

01:07:55.884 --> 01:07:59.716
[... has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal.]

01:08:00.305 --> 01:08:04.433
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming.]

01:08:05.059 --> 01:08:08.724
The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer...]

01:08:09.313 --> 01:08:12.765
[... Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America.]

01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:15.767
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...

01:08:15.862 --> 01:08:18.353
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...

01:08:18.447 --> 01:08:20.024
...in our report of March 9th.

01:08:20.116 --> 01:08:23.532
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...

01:08:23.618 --> 01:08:26.371
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:29.779
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:34.502
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:37.121
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...

01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:39.920
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:42.301
I fully expected this treatment.

01:08:43.095 --> 01:08:46.548
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:50.140
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.264
His proposition is very simple:

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:56.104
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...

01:08:56.318 --> 01:08:57.728
...must be a Communist.

01:08:58.444 --> 01:09:02.193
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

01:09:02.866 --> 01:09:06.484
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

01:09:06.578 --> 01:09:08.654
He claimed, but offered no proof...

01:09:08.746 --> 01:09:12.080
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:13.328
That is false.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.707
I was never a member ofthe IWW,
never applied for membership.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.412
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...

01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:24.545
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

01:09:24.636 --> 01:09:25.716
That's true.

01:09:26.013 --> 01:09:29.465
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

01:09:30.518 --> 01:09:32.225
He was a civilized individual...

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:35.560
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...

01:09:35.648 --> 01:09:38.483
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:41.143
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

01:09:42.071 --> 01:09:44.562
I ask, as he makes clear
in the introduction...

01:09:44.656 --> 01:09:48.108
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...

01:09:48.202 --> 01:09:52.033
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

01:09:52.538 --> 01:09:54.247
And the dedication so reads.

01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:58.290
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...

01:09:58.754 --> 01:10:02.372
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...

01:10:02.465 --> 01:10:05.716
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.340
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:11.712
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.591
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...

01:10:14.894 --> 01:10:19.307
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...

01:10:19.774 --> 01:10:21.601
...but in the area of ideas.

01:10:23.861 --> 01:10:26.531
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:30.654
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...

01:10:30.743 --> 01:10:33.151
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:37.448
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...

01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:40.163
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

01:10:41.295 --> 01:10:43.667
Having searched my conscience
and my files...

01:10:43.756 --> 01:10:46.792
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...

01:10:46.884 --> 01:10:50.004
...but I have attempted to pursue
thet ruth with diligence...

01:10:50.095 --> 01:10:51.210
...and to report it...

01:10:51.305 --> 01:10:54.389
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...

01:10:54.475 --> 01:10:58.009
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

01:10:58.979 --> 01:11:03.107
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

01:11:03.942 --> 01:11:05.602
Good night, and good luck.

01:11:13.326 --> 01:11:17.110
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...

01:11:17.205 --> 01:11:19.494
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:22.287
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:25.164
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...

01:11:25.255 --> 01:11:28.754
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

01:11:29.634 --> 01:11:32.207
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

01:11:32.303 --> 01:11:34.379
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

01:11:35.014 --> 01:11:37.683
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion...

01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:39.344
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

01:11:40.436 --> 01:11:41.467
What?

01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:45.222
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...

01:11:45.316 --> 01:11:48.685
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

01:11:48.778 --> 01:11:52.822
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:56.240
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

01:11:56.327 --> 01:11:58.118
- Really?
- What happened?

01:11:58.287 --> 01:12:01.157
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

01:12:01.248 --> 01:12:02.742
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:04.624
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.583
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:09.664
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...

01:12:09.756 --> 01:12:12.508
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:16.460
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

01:12:19.766 --> 01:12:23.301
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

01:12:23.395 --> 01:12:25.802
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...

01:12:25.897 --> 01:12:27.724
...and be privy to other testimony.

01:12:28.024 --> 01:12:31.891
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk toThompson.

01:12:34.447 --> 01:12:35.941
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:39.778
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

01:12:41.079 --> 01:12:43.071
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

01:12:44.916 --> 01:12:51.535
- 74, 76,47. Thank you.
- Murrayville3, 1-2-7-6.

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:14.686
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...

01:13:14.778 --> 01:13:18.728
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...

01:13:19.449 --> 01:13:24.491
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

01:13:25.872 --> 01:13:29.122
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...

01:13:29.459 --> 01:13:31.784
...and questionable new methods
considered...

01:13:31.878 --> 01:13:37.465
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

01:15:11.684 --> 01:15:13.723
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:19.894
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

01:15:20.609 --> 01:15:23.065
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...

01:15:23.445 --> 01:15:26.067
...but noone ever called it
anything but honest.

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:30.274
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

01:15:31.244 --> 01:15:33.617
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now'.

01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:37.166
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.

01:15:37.876 --> 01:15:40.581
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:43.744
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:46.747
Not much of an obit.

01:15:47.218 --> 01:15:50.385
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

01:15:51.431 --> 01:15:53.969
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

01:15:54.934 --> 01:15:56.726
Good night, and good luck.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.481
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:07.064
What time is your train?

01:16:08.155 --> 01:16:09.151
9:00.

01:16:10.741 --> 01:16:13.315
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:22.336 --> 01:16:23.534
Here's a thought.

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:26.756
What if we're wrong?

01:16:29.426 --> 01:16:30.671
We're not wrong.

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.095
We're not going to look back...

01:16:36.141 --> 01:16:38.264
...and say we protected
the wrong side?

01:16:40.687 --> 01:16:46.026
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

01:16:47.152 --> 01:16:50.568
Argument could bemade,
'for the greater good".

01:16:52.824 --> 01:16:55.529
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.620
It's just a thought.

01:17:05.336 --> 01:17:10.081
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

01:17:10.174 --> 01:17:12.748
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

01:17:12.969 --> 01:17:16.801
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

01:17:16.889 --> 01:17:19.510
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

01:17:19.684 --> 01:17:22.768
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

01:17:23.187 --> 01:17:28.643
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

01:17:28.984 --> 01:17:32.519
- Let's... let's...
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

01:17:32.738 --> 01:17:37.863
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

01:17:38.243 --> 01:17:42.241
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

01:17:42.372 --> 01:17:45.872
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation...

01:17:45.959 --> 01:17:49.743
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...

01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:53.297
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:57.085
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

01:17:57.262 --> 01:18:02.600
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

01:18:02.684 --> 01:18:05.720
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

01:18:05.812 --> 01:18:09.560
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

01:18:09.857 --> 01:18:12.562
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

01:18:12.652 --> 01:18:14.027
I think no comment.

01:18:17.657 --> 01:18:21.026
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I cant write about it.

01:18:21.118 --> 01:18:23.526
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

01:18:23.621 --> 01:18:26.788
- Charlie said he dropped...
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.624
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

01:18:28.751 --> 01:18:29.747
You, too.

01:18:40.054 --> 01:18:41.133
Close the door.

01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.470
Have a seat.

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:52.224
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

01:18:52.899 --> 01:18:55.984
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...

01:18:56.069 --> 01:18:58.192
...that no two employees
can be married.

01:19:00.991 --> 01:19:04.407
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

01:19:04.494 --> 01:19:06.237
I want you to consider it.

01:19:07.414 --> 01:19:09.074
I know you two are married.

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:12.282
Everyone knows.

01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:14.742
That's not my question.

01:19:15.129 --> 01:19:18.214
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:21.134
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

01:19:22.428 --> 01:19:24.053
I wanted you to know that...

01:19:24.263 --> 01:19:27.217
...because you could save
someone else being fired.

01:19:29.393 --> 01:19:33.261
I'm asking you to consider
makng this decision a little easier.

01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:37.268
I don't need an answer now.

01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:40.859
Just think about it.

01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:43.527
Good.

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.705
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

01:19:57.129 --> 01:20:00.332
- Sure we'regonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

01:20:03.593 --> 01:20:06.298
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

01:20:08.932 --> 01:20:10.212
Mrs. Wershba...

01:20:13.103 --> 01:20:14.265
Everybody knew.

01:20:23.321 --> 01:20:25.278
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

01:20:25.365 --> 01:20:28.235
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

01:20:43.966 --> 01:20:45.081
Uh-oh!

01:20:48.512 --> 01:20:51.963
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

01:20:52.349 --> 01:20:54.674
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

01:20:54.768 --> 01:20:56.144
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

01:20:56.228 --> 01:20:58.801
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

01:20:58.897 --> 01:21:00.806
Fred, you're speakng
beyond your competence.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.307
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

01:21:03.402 --> 01:21:07.102
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 90,000 in sponsors...

01:21:07.197 --> 01:21:09.403
...and it costs one-third
of what youdo.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:12.492
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:16.029
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:19.040
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache...

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:21.616
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.

01:21:23.338 --> 01:21:26.422
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:30.796
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:33.294
The content of what we're doing
is more important...

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.758
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
- It's what you'redoing, Ed. Not me.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:37.966
Not Frank Stanton. You.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:42.350
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong to you, Bill.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.554
You wouldn't know it.

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:50.110
- What is it you want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:55.486
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.

01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:57.661
I fight to keep the license...

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.115
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:06.249
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.751
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.794
I would argue that this network...

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:18.091
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:22.228
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:25.479
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:33.191
Let me ask you this:

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.699
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...

01:22:36.784 --> 01:22:39.821
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:43.703
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:47.578
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:50.505
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:56.218
What do you want to do, Bill?

01:23:00.224 --> 01:23:03.178
I'm takng your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:06.768
And it wont be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

01:23:07.398 --> 01:23:09.770
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

01:23:13.278 --> 01:23:15.567
- How many episodes?
- 5.

01:23:18.325 --> 01:23:20.234
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

01:23:20.369 --> 01:23:22.741
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

01:23:27.209 --> 01:23:28.584
You owe me 5 shows.

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:41.216
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

01:23:41.389 --> 01:23:43.547
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

01:23:58.281 --> 01:24:00.606
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

01:24:06.831 --> 01:24:10.164
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

01:24:10.334 --> 01:24:13.370
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

01:24:16.507 --> 01:24:19.923
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:23.213
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

01:24:23.555 --> 01:24:27.767
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

01:24:38.403 --> 01:24:40.609
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

01:24:44.617 --> 01:24:47.535
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.578
See, you should have worn a dress!

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:53.912
- Howd does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:57.499
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

01:24:57.588 --> 01:24:59.628
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

01:24:59.716 --> 01:25:02.503
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...

01:25:02.969 --> 01:25:04.427
...man can walk upright.

01:25:07.139 --> 01:25:09.381
No matter who he is
or who she is.

01:25:10.267 --> 01:25:14.217
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

01:25:15.106 --> 01:25:18.142
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...

01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:21.268
...may be in a position
of great power...

01:25:22.237 --> 01:25:27.030
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...

01:25:28.577 --> 01:25:32.076
...to rott here without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

01:25:34.124 --> 01:25:37.208
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.

01:25:38.045 --> 01:25:41.248
I began by saying that our history
will be what we makeit.

01:25:42.007 --> 01:25:43.549
If we go on as we are...

01:25:43.842 --> 01:25:47.425
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...

01:25:47.512 --> 01:25:48.923
...in catching up with us.

01:25:50.432 --> 01:25:54.429
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

01:25:55.812 --> 01:25:59.263
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...

01:25:59.357 --> 01:26:01.599
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...

01:26:01.693 --> 01:26:05.477
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

01:26:05.571 --> 01:26:08.987
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...

01:26:09.075 --> 01:26:13.369
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:17.865
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:21.370
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

01:26:22.171 --> 01:26:23.167
Would anything happen...

01:26:23.255 --> 01:26:27.039
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...

01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:30.384
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...

01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:32.962
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?

01:26:33.724 --> 01:26:37.140
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."

01:26:37.227 --> 01:26:40.228
"...they're tooc omplacent,
indifferent and insulated"...

01:26:40.439 --> 01:26:44.306
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...

01:26:44.776 --> 01:26:47.398
...considerable evidence
against that contention.

01:26:48.447 --> 01:26:51.447
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.277
Because if they are right...

01:26:53.368 --> 01:26:55.408
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...

01:26:55.495 --> 01:26:58.033
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...

01:26:58.748 --> 01:27:00.622
...then the tube is flickering now...

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:03.793
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

01:27:04.754 --> 01:27:06.296
This instrument can teach.

01:27:06.714 --> 01:27:09.205
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

01:27:09.884 --> 01:27:13.964
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...

01:27:14.055 --> 01:27:15.466
...towards those ends.

01:27:16.891 --> 01:27:19.464
Otherwise,
it is merely wiresand lights...

01:27:20.186 --> 01:27:21.348
...in a box.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.896
Good night, and good luck.
