00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.179
Previously on Empire...
Happy birthday, Hakeem!

00:12.546 --> 00:13.914
Kennedy!

00:13.947 --> 00:16.317
As of this minute,
your channel is shut down.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.086
(clears throat)
What's that?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.320
You getting that ALS again?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.888
I have myasthenia gravis.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.690
You thinking about doing
some business in Vegas?

00:22.723 --> 00:23.757
I hate Vegas,

00:23.791 --> 00:25.025
but we get this anonymous tip.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.760
You sure you don't know
nothing about this?

00:26.794 --> 00:27.828
No.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.763
Cookie, I did not
snitch on you.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.933
But there's one thing Tariq
will take if you let him: me.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.436
I've been trying to get
to Lucious Lyon a long time.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.539
And you can't touch him,
but I can.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.177
There you go.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.512
Where is Lucious?
Upstairs.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.414
I've never seen
him this bad, Doc.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.581
DOCTOR BART:
Let's go.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.016
Now, you let this go untreated

00:49.049 --> 00:51.752
and it can be
life-threatening, Lucious.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.722
(labored breathing):
I'm not going to no ICU.

00:54.755 --> 00:55.956
Lucious, please.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.458
Please listen to
what he's saying.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.892
Whatever you got to do,

00:58.926 --> 01:00.027
you're gonna
do it right here.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.129
That is crazy.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.363
In my house.
THIRSTY:
Listen to me.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.364
He doesn't want to
leave the house.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.765
He doesn't want
to go to a hospital.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.234
Okay, so-- But we got
all the equipment

01:06.267 --> 01:08.802
to create an ICU environment
here, right?

01:08.836 --> 01:10.037
So, medically speaking,

01:10.070 --> 01:11.472
you could do it, just do it.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.741
Even with all the right
equipment, it's illegal.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.209
Legalities? Doc, relax.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.710
I'm an officer
of the court.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.979
I'll make sure you're protected
and well-compensated.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.148
Just get it done.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.083
(sighs)

01:23.117 --> 01:24.418
Okay, let's get it done.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.053
We're gonna have to put
a tube down your throat

01:26.086 --> 01:28.055
so the machine can
breathe for you,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.257
and we're gonna
give you your shot

01:29.290 --> 01:30.324
to keep you as
comfortable as possible.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.592
Okay.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.261
All right, guys,
put the vent over there

01:33.294 --> 01:34.462
and set up
portable suction.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.964
Let's get set up
to intubate.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.602
Get them out of here.
THIRSTY: Listen.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.103
Let's give the doctors
some room, okay, Gran?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.738
He's gonna be okay.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.176
I need you to...
watch my family.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.277
Watch your
family, got it.

01:49.310 --> 01:53.447
There's snakes in my family.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.616
Okay. I got you.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.118
Just try and breathe
as normally as possible.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.090
THIRSTY: I promise you, I'm
gonna keep my eye on the family.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.426
All right? No one's gonna make
any moves on you, Lucious.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.894
I got your back.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.365
(upbeat R&B music playing)

02:13.401 --> 02:16.103
A'ight, so this is "Dangerous,"

02:16.136 --> 02:17.971
and it's gonna be
the first track

02:18.005 --> 02:19.106
on When Cookie Met Lucious.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.608
The reason why
we're on it together

02:20.641 --> 02:22.443
is because the album
is a narrative

02:22.476 --> 02:23.811
from my parents'
relationship

02:23.844 --> 02:25.713
that started off beautiful

02:25.746 --> 02:27.181
and it kind of
ended up bad.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.617
But the first video, Negin,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.385
it needs to really
give off the idea

02:31.419 --> 02:34.688
of that "do anything,
crazy-ass love" situation.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.823
PORSHA:
See, no.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.824
I've been there, done that,

02:36.857 --> 02:37.991
and I got the credit score
to prove it.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.493
JAMAL: But you see
what I'm saying, though?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.161
Like, the fans
need to feel that.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.231
They need to feel the passion,
or else they won't understand

02:43.264 --> 02:44.898
when the album unravels

02:44.932 --> 02:46.334
and turns tragic.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.802
And you guys know I'm down
for whatever you want to do.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.137
I'm into it.
And I'm happy it's up-tempo.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.372
Can I dance a bit in it?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.374
Your ass just want to dance.
Just get it, get it, get it.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.576
(laughter)

02:55.609 --> 02:57.978
Our concept for the video
is idealized young love

02:58.011 --> 02:59.747
with you and Delphine

02:59.780 --> 03:01.349
as Lucious and Cookie,

03:01.382 --> 03:03.817
showing us what that
crazy, mad love looks like.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.919
Well, team, we have
a new production date.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.221
* Break it down,
break it down... *

03:07.255 --> 03:08.222
We gonna shoot
this baby tonight.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.490
JAMAL: Tonight?
NEGIN: Tonight?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.259
Cut the music.
(music stops)

03:11.292 --> 03:13.861
Turns out your slimy father
caught some nasty virus

03:13.894 --> 03:15.696
and he can't get out of bed.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.764
It's probably the skeevies.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.199
Ma.
Anyway, if we move fast,

03:19.233 --> 03:21.235
we could release a teaser
this week on XStream

03:21.269 --> 03:22.603
before he finds out
and blocks it.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.506
While that man is
laid up in the bed.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.607
That is unnecessarily
shady, Mom.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.342
Come on.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.777
Did he pump the
breaks on Inferno

03:29.810 --> 03:31.178
when you were
laid up in rehab,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.913
trying to recover,
after you took

03:32.946 --> 03:34.415
a bullet for his dirty ass?

03:35.649 --> 03:36.584
Huh?

03:37.985 --> 03:41.855
So now I am
the sole healthy CEO,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.591
and I have the power
to make this all happen.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.759
All right, well, just a teaser,
okay? Just a teaser.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.928
You know,
to get people hyped.
Like "Formation" did

03:47.961 --> 03:51.031
for Lemonade.
And like Frank did with
the woodworking loop on Endless.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.566
Hmm.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.735
You know you love it. Go ahead.

03:54.768 --> 03:59.407
Look, boy, I bared my soul
for you to tell this story.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.041
It better be good.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.476
Do you hear me?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.679
I got you, Ma.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.283
Okay. Make me proud.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.718
Okay.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.152
I love that afro, girl.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.822
Hey, come on, y'all.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.791
Sheesh. All right.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.727
My client, Kennedy Marshall,
was assaulted

04:19.760 --> 04:21.462
inside an Empire club

04:21.495 --> 04:24.932
by a member of an Empire
artist's crew at an event

04:24.965 --> 04:27.968
sponsored by
Empire's own streaming service.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.236
This suited bitch is trippin'.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.771
Clamp your lips, boy.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.239
Turn it up, Porsha.
Let's see what they after.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.308
(reporters clamoring)

04:34.342 --> 04:35.943
This isn't about money.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.178
It's about making sure
that no other woman

04:38.211 --> 04:41.114
has to go through
what I went through.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.585
We are suing Empire
Enterprises for $50 million.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.987
We are also demanding
that Hakeem Lyon

04:47.020 --> 04:49.490
cancel all upcoming
club appearances

04:49.523 --> 04:52.125
and issue a public apology
to Kennedy

04:52.159 --> 04:54.261
and to all women for
the culture of violence

04:54.294 --> 04:57.698
and misogyny
he and his music encourages.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.267
This is way
out of control.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.436
Does Dad know about this?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.838
(phone vibrates)

05:04.872 --> 05:06.440
(chuckles)

05:06.474 --> 05:08.041
Well, he does now.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.810
Bring your ass, boy.
(groans)

05:09.843 --> 05:11.979
I didn't do nothin'!

05:12.012 --> 05:13.280
Shut up.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
*

05:20.354 --> 05:23.724
Dre, I don't even think I have
enough songs for a full set.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.394
And Giuliana wants me
to open in Vegas in two months.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.129
I don't want you to worry
about this, Nessa.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.198
Look, this is gonna be
Empire's top priority.

05:31.231 --> 05:34.001
You got me working for you,
you got Shine working for you.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.137
And you're sure Giuliana
wants me to headline the show?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.338
I'll handle Giuliana, okay?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.340
All right.
It's a big deal for her

05:40.374 --> 05:42.743
to be in business with Empire,
but she doesn't suffer fools.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.044
GIULIANA:
Well,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.046
all fools have their place.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.548
May I?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.683
Please.
Giuliana.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.822
Would you mind
getting me a drink?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.757
I'm parched.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.359
Single malt, right?

05:59.393 --> 06:01.695
See? Not a fool in sight.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.130
(chuckles)

06:08.702 --> 06:11.539
Oh, that is one fine man
you have there.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.340
Thank you.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.943
We're, uh... we're actually
moving in together.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.945
GIULIANA:
Oh. Well, that's cute.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.380
So how does that work,
with your hookups?

06:20.414 --> 06:22.382
Do you bring them home
together now?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.852
Wh-What do you mean, hookups?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.054
Well, Dre told me
about your arrangement.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.089
And, at first,
I was a little surprised,

06:29.122 --> 06:31.358
but now I'm actually intrigued.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.694
You know,
I was wondering maybe...

06:33.727 --> 06:36.530
I could come and hang out
with the two of you.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.365
I don't know. But only
if you're comfortable with that.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.536
I'm sorry, Giuliana,
I don't... I don't follow.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.371
You know, I remember
when I met my husband.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.206
Ugh, I was so in love
with him.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.742
I could never imagine
sharing him with another woman.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.077
But...

06:50.110 --> 06:51.712
I guess times have changed.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.914
ANDRE:
Here you go.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.915
Ah.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.717
Single malt.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.752
Yes, it is.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.921
To new beginnings.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.158
Cheers.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.998
Yes, honey, you are taking
me back with that hair.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.766
Girl, you did that.
WOMAN: Thanks, Cookie.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.401
Um, I need to know
how you fell in love.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.504
I mean, how do you fall in love
with someone like Lucious?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.772
Tell her how you fell in love
with that gorgeous scoundrel.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.407
Oh, stop it, boy.
(chuckles)

07:20.440 --> 07:22.142
NEGIN: Swing around, guys.
We'll get this. Film her.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.845
Well, the song isn't just
about love at first sight.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.448
It's about... a lifetime,
about the risks

07:28.482 --> 07:30.250
two people take
when their lives

07:30.283 --> 07:32.119
and their destinies cross.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.987
It was always
about the music.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.490
Lucious's music was
the very air that I breathed.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.425
It was the blood

07:38.458 --> 07:40.928
pumping through my veins.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.663
And when music
can do that to you,

07:42.696 --> 07:44.197
whew, that's
when you know.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.600
(train passing)

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
(hip-hop beat playing)

07:57.745 --> 07:59.479
(pager beeps)

07:59.513 --> 08:02.315
Damn. I'm late for a drop.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.216
(music stops)

08:03.250 --> 08:04.217
I got to roll.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.019
(train passing)

08:06.053 --> 08:08.522
("Dangerous" playing)

08:08.556 --> 08:09.623
* Ow *

08:09.657 --> 08:10.658
* Uh *

08:14.327 --> 08:17.030
* I love the way
you talk to me *

08:17.064 --> 08:18.632
* I love the way I'm feeling *

08:18.666 --> 08:21.134
* When you get close to me *

08:21.168 --> 08:22.836
* I'm feeling
like I'm winning *

08:22.870 --> 08:24.705
DELPHINE: * So new
for my eyes to see *

08:24.738 --> 08:27.407
* So good make it
hard to speak *

08:27.440 --> 08:29.209
* When you look at me, boy *

08:29.242 --> 08:30.143
* Oh, my goodness *

08:30.177 --> 08:31.511
* It's brand-new *

08:31.545 --> 08:34.047
* It feels so good *

08:34.081 --> 08:36.316
* I can't get my head around *

08:36.349 --> 08:38.686
* I just lose my cool *

08:38.719 --> 08:40.253
* Sometimes *

08:40.287 --> 08:41.755
* A new love *

08:41.789 --> 08:43.423
* It's a new love *

08:43.456 --> 08:46.894
* I just can't get you
up off my mind... *

08:48.261 --> 08:49.763
Uh-uh, look,
I'll do it.

08:49.797 --> 08:53.333
Keep going. Look,
you're onto something real.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.669
Nah, baby girl, you're not
getting mixed up in my business.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.606
Look, I'm not your baby girl,
I'm your partner.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.874
And I'm already mixed up
in your business.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.910
* It's brand-new *

09:02.943 --> 09:04.511
* It feels so good *

09:04.544 --> 09:06.680
* I can't get my head around *

09:06.714 --> 09:10.517
* I just lose my cool
sometimes *

09:10.550 --> 09:12.352
* A new love *

09:12.385 --> 09:14.254
* It's a new love *

09:14.287 --> 09:17.090
* I just can't get you
up off my mind *

09:17.124 --> 09:19.693
* I said, I said ooh... *

09:19.727 --> 09:22.663
This music is
gonna be our future.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.435
It's gonna be
her future.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.572
Give it to me.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.050
(train passing)

09:43.083 --> 09:45.185
(Jamal and Delphine laughing)

09:46.586 --> 09:48.555
DELPHINE: Ooh.
JAMAL: Ma? Ma?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.990
What'd you think?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.559
Hey, hey.
COOKIE:
That feeling...

09:52.592 --> 09:54.995
(chuckles softly)

09:55.028 --> 09:58.632
...that's a feeling that you
chase and you never let go of.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.904
Never imagined I'd ever
experience that feeling

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
until I met Lucious.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.346
DIRECTOR:
All right.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.382
Reset.
Back to one, everybody.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.453
It's good. Mm-hmm.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.128
Lucious?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.763
He can't talk.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.598
Is it that serious?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.867
And why's he intubated?
What's wrong with him?

10:33.901 --> 10:35.635
THIRSTY: Listen, Lucious
called you all here because

10:35.669 --> 10:37.604
he has nothing
to hide.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.506
This is just a small
myasthenic crisis.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.941
We're-we're business as usual.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.843
There's nothing small
about a crisis.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.311
Does he have
ALS again?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.013
That's not how
ALS works, Hakeem.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.515
Excuse me, Cookie.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.351
Look, I need
you guys to focus.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.386
Okay? The reason why we're
having this family meeting

10:53.420 --> 10:54.654
is because the boss

10:54.688 --> 10:55.789
wants to shut
down this lawsuit

10:55.823 --> 10:57.324
as quick as possible.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.727
First off, let's talk
PR damage control.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.494
Now, I spoke to, uh,
the Empire PR team,

11:01.528 --> 11:03.030
and we're hoping that,

11:03.063 --> 11:05.298
since tomorrow is the, uh,
Democratic primary,

11:05.332 --> 11:07.234
maybe you could
talk to Angelo,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.903
you know, to make a statement
in support of Empire.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.304
(chuckles)

11:11.338 --> 11:15.709
After you sabotage his campaign
and endorse his opponent?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.544
Yeah, good luck with that.
Y'all are something else.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.546
Forget PR, okay?
The longer this goes on,

11:19.579 --> 11:21.548
the more damage it does
to all our brands.

11:21.581 --> 11:22.850
Including Empire XStream.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.384
I say we make
a settlement offer.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.254
Muscleman would just
turn back on my channel,

11:27.287 --> 11:29.056
I could tell my fans I'm sorry.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
Like that lawyer
asked for,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.025
so we could just
shut this down.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.095
Hakeem, an apology would just
open Empire for liability.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.696
And, Andre, I mean,

11:36.730 --> 11:38.365
let's not talk about
settling anything yet.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.001
I've handled hundreds of cases
like this before.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.370
What we're gonna do is dig up
all the dirt we can on that girl

11:43.403 --> 11:45.906
and depose her.
JAMAL: Are you kidding me?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.407
First of all, that's
called victim blaming.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.942
Aside from being despicable,
most of his fans are females.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.043
What are they gonna say?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.779
Okay, Jamal, calm down.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.047
I don't get it. I would never
put my hands on a female.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.048
I have a daughter.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.716
All right.
Uh, Lucious, is this it?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.386
Because if you done
saving the day, some of us

11:59.419 --> 12:00.620
have real work to do.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.422
Yeah.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.690
Okay, the meeting is adjourned.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.293
You guys can go for now.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.560
Hey, Dad.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.364
THIRSTY:
Listen, Hakeem,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.100
maybe you can show up
at the deposition.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.402
Face the girl.
Intimidation is key.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.240
You look like hell, man.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.477
How come you're not
in the hospital?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.447
ANIKA: You know,
we tried that,

12:27.480 --> 12:28.882
but he's just too paranoid,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.818
thinking someone's gonna
make a move behind his back.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.920
(chuckles)

12:32.953 --> 12:36.623
Well, you stay locked up in here
like the mad king.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.993
See how far that
gets your dumb ass.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.594
Stupid.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.070
Oh, that's right.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.671
Oh, yeah.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.273
We'd like to know
when you're gonna find

12:53.306 --> 12:54.441
the time to wear this wire.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.675
Get Tariq

12:55.708 --> 12:57.244
to fess up
to all his illegal tactics

12:57.277 --> 12:58.846
so we can get these Feds
off our back.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.080
I am working on it; I just need

13:00.113 --> 13:01.281
a little time
to get his trust first.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.750
I can't rush
this, Lucious.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.486
If he finds out,
then he's gonna kill me.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.156
Mm-hmm.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.358
So, let's be clear.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.861
If you don't
get this done...

13:13.894 --> 13:15.195
you could still be killed,

13:15.228 --> 13:16.864
and Tariq framed
for the whole thing.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.166
(scoffs)

13:19.199 --> 13:20.800
Is he behind this?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.135
Just one of my thoughts.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.039
Boss, I got to prepare for the
deposition. You cool for now?

13:27.908 --> 13:31.311
(snapping fingers)

13:33.380 --> 13:34.447
(sighs)

13:34.481 --> 13:36.149
Well, Lucious,

13:36.183 --> 13:39.619
looks like it's, uh...

13:39.652 --> 13:42.789
just you and me.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.558
And since you're
all sedated,

13:45.592 --> 13:49.396
this might be
the perfect time to...

13:49.429 --> 13:50.697
take advantage of you.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.832
(whispers):
Please.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.201
Don't die, Lucious.
Please don't die.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.870
Because if you die,

13:56.904 --> 14:00.240
I'll get everything.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.642
'Cause, you know,

14:02.675 --> 14:04.811
we didn't sign
that prenup.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.415
(machine beeping, air hissing)

14:08.448 --> 14:09.816
Are you okay?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.185
(grunts)
Lucious, are you...?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.587
Do you want me to...

14:14.621 --> 14:16.389
maybe just keep
holding on to this?

14:16.423 --> 14:18.725
(gasping softly)

14:18.758 --> 14:22.329
Lucious, you tell Thirsty
that I'm not here for him.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.830
You tell him
to hang back.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.265
I am not his bitch.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.571
(sighs)

14:33.806 --> 14:35.808
(air flows, beeping stops)

14:50.423 --> 14:54.027
*

14:54.061 --> 14:55.862
* I get those goose bumps
every time... *

14:55.895 --> 14:57.965
Cabaret license is easier
to get than a gaming license,

14:57.998 --> 14:59.933
but it can still
take up to six months.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.268
And what did
your friend want

15:01.301 --> 15:02.970
in exchange for
speeding up the process?

15:03.003 --> 15:06.974
Well, I'm not really sure, but
we'll have to see, won't we?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.042
This ain't Lucious Lyon.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.643
You promised me
Lucious Lyon, Giuliana.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.946
Relax, Gino. This is Andre Lyon,

15:12.980 --> 15:14.314
Lucious's son.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.748
He runs Empire.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.317
His father's
just a figurehead.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.585
Andre, this is

15:18.618 --> 15:19.819
Gino Marcone.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.056
So you're the brains, huh?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.091
That's what they say.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.293
* I'm pulling up
right beside ya *

15:26.326 --> 15:28.461
* Pop star, love Mariah
when I text a cute game... *

15:28.495 --> 15:29.929
Okay, brains.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.631
(clears throat)

15:31.664 --> 15:34.634
Tell me why I should help Empire
get a casino license in Vegas.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.136
What are you
gonna do for me?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.504
Well, we'll cover
the costs, obviously.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.406
Pay an expediting
fee on top.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.641
Long as it's reasonable.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.810
What, are you gonna leave me
a tip? We're not your waiters.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.279
25% off the top,
monthly,

15:46.313 --> 15:47.447
for as long as
you're in business.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.316
That's ridiculous.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.285
My board will never approve it.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.487
I don't see
any board here.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.223
Just you and me
and, uh, my friends.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.928
ANDRE: You're not the only one
that's got friends here, Gino.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.296
MAN:
Yeah. There you go.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.169
What'd I miss? Am I late?

16:09.202 --> 16:10.237
No, you're right
on time, brother.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.841
How's five percent
sounding?

16:14.874 --> 16:16.843
Neighbor.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.217
(chuckles)

16:31.024 --> 16:32.459
ANDRE:
My man.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.394
* I need the Heimlich... *

16:34.427 --> 16:35.995
Giuliana?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.299
* I get those goose bumps
every time... *

16:39.332 --> 16:40.467
Nice work.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.868
* When you're not around *

16:41.901 --> 16:44.037
* When you throw that
to the side *

16:44.071 --> 16:46.506
* I get those goose bumps
every time... *

16:46.539 --> 16:48.908
I knew I liked you.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.943
(both laugh)

16:52.545 --> 16:55.515
*

17:00.253 --> 17:03.022
(doorbell rings)

17:04.957 --> 17:06.226
What is it?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.660
ANIKA:
May I come in?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.329
What do you want?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.331
Look, this isn't about
me or you.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.865
This is about Bella.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.204
Come on.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.675
(clears throat)

17:22.709 --> 17:24.711
You know that Lucious
is wanting me to, uh,

17:24.744 --> 17:26.446
wear a wire with Tariq.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.115
Yeah, well, if you're looking
for a way out, honey,

17:28.148 --> 17:29.416
you need to keep looking.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.286
No, I just wanted
to say that...

17:33.320 --> 17:36.055
if something happens to me,

17:36.089 --> 17:38.725
if I go to jail...

17:38.758 --> 17:40.527
(sighs)

17:40.560 --> 17:41.761
...or if I die,

17:41.794 --> 17:43.696
I want you
to promise me

17:43.730 --> 17:45.532
that you're gonna
look after my daughter.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.900
Of course I will.
We all will. She's safe.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.437
No. You.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.306
Personally.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.876
I need Bella to live with you.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.713
You are the only one
that I trust with her.

18:00.747 --> 18:05.051
So you want someone you hate
to take care of your daughter?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.154
Bella is a Lyon.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.158
And I know how dangerous
that can be.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.593
Because I've seen firsthand
what you're willing to do

18:13.626 --> 18:15.595
to protect your own blood.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.400
Bella needs that.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.068
(chuckles softly)

18:22.101 --> 18:23.936
Okay.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.405
You have my word.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.175
Bella will always
have a home with me.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.180
Thank you.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.583
Okay, that's all
I wanted.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.050
All right.

18:43.055 --> 18:47.260
Look, Cookie, I know I've said
and done a lot of wild things

18:47.294 --> 18:49.296
for the man
that we both love, but...

18:49.329 --> 18:50.763
Uh, there's only one man I love,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.365
and his name ain't
Lucious, honey.

18:52.399 --> 18:56.636
You can say that,
but it's not the truth.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.321
COOKIE: I bet I just cast
the deciding vote.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.622
ANGELO:
Yeah.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.391
Meeks and I are tied
at the polls, so...

19:18.425 --> 19:19.659
it's out of my hands.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.061
Oh, please,
you got this.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.064
Look, can you
promise me that, uh,

19:25.097 --> 19:26.899
Lucious isn't gonna
crash this party?

19:26.933 --> 19:29.035
'Cause I can have it
at the community center.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.137
You know that, right? Hey, now.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Can we get a shot, Councilman?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.572
Look, tonight is
not about him.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.006
This is your night.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.975
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Cookie, over here.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.010
There you go.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.746
I hope you're right.
Can we get a shot?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.514
COOKIE: Yes, take a picture
of the winner, baby.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.383
We got a new mayor in town.
Thank you very much.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.152
Baby, Lucious is surrounded
by a slew of nurses, okay?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.587
He can't move.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.856
Laviticus is all ours
tonight, I promise.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.658
All right, all right.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.326
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it's you!

19:53.360 --> 19:54.861
Hey, ladies.
Cookie Lyon!

19:54.894 --> 19:56.229
Yes.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.064
Girl, we saw the teaser,
When Cookie Met Lucious.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.567
It's lit.
(chuckles)

20:00.600 --> 20:02.769
("Dangerous" playing over phone)
COOKIE: Lucious's music

20:02.802 --> 20:04.604
was the very air
that I breathed.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.275
It was the blood
pumping through my veins.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.209
Never imagined I'd ever
experience that feeling

20:10.243 --> 20:11.511
until I met Lucious.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.012
Uh, that's great.
I'm glad you liked it.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.414
We got to go.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.848
We can't wait for
the album to drop.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.584
Low-key, we pulling
for you and Lucious to get

20:17.617 --> 20:19.786
back together now.
Ah, no, that's not
gonna happen.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.354
I'm with Angelo now...
Team Coocious,
all day.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.690
All day, every day.
(laughs) Mm-hmm.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.191
No, come, come, you get in it.
No, it's o...

20:25.224 --> 20:26.192

20:27.960 --> 20:29.362
COOKIE:
Okay, that's enough. Bye-bye.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.298
WOMEN: Thank you! Bye!
Take care now.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.267
COOKIE: Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.402
Uh, ladies?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.305
Vote for
Angelo Dubois!

20:38.338 --> 20:39.772
Okay, everybody, all y'all!
Vote for Angelo Dubois!

20:39.806 --> 20:41.308
Cookie, that's against
the law. Come over here.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.775
Yes, a black man,
baby.
Cookie.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.043
(laughs)

20:44.076 --> 20:45.912
See? Don't you feel good,
about tonight?

20:45.945 --> 20:46.946
Yeah.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.649
What the hell was that about?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.585
Jamal dropped his
teaser from his album.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.421
That's all, but
it means nothing.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.723
Wait, and it's about
you and Lucious?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.257
(sighs)

20:58.291 --> 21:00.760
Isn't that sweet.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.429
And it came out today?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.331
On the day of the primary?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.965
Angelo, it means
nothing, okay?

21:05.998 --> 21:06.966
Unbelievable.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.101
Look, more importantly,

21:09.135 --> 21:10.803
whatever happens tonight,
I'm with you.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.439
Are you sure
about that?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.106
'Cause right about now,
you seem to be

21:14.140 --> 21:15.908
all about Team Coocious.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.909
Are you serious?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.211
All day, every day, huh?
(chuckles)

21:20.212 --> 21:21.314
Angelo?

21:21.348 --> 21:22.749
That man has
always been

21:22.782 --> 21:24.351
a terrible influence on you.

Barry, hey.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.883
Haven't seen you around school.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.051
I heard about your dad.
I'm so sorry.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.454
Thanks, thanks. We're good.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.656
Are you sure? If you need help
with anything, just ask.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.392
It's not too late to apply
for that scholarship...

22:05.425 --> 22:07.727
Look, I said I'm good.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.698
What are you
doing, anyway?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.200
What's Lucious
got you into?

22:16.736 --> 22:18.638
Look...

22:18.671 --> 22:21.073
Lucious ain't got me
into nothing.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.676
I make my own decisions.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.913
Look, Barry, don't you have some
books to study or something?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.861

Hey, Shine.

D-MAJOR:
So this is where Angelo's

22:57.977 --> 22:59.178
big party's gonna be tonight.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.080
Nice.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.381
What if he loses?

23:02.415 --> 23:03.750
We still got
to have something

23:03.783 --> 23:05.284
for the volunteers
and everybody.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.687
Just, hopefully, we won't
be drowning our sorrows.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.257
Look, um, I'd like
to sit and chit-chat,

23:11.290 --> 23:14.427
but, um, I need to set
some things straight with you.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.796
No pun intended, huh?
(chuckles)

23:16.829 --> 23:19.432
Um...

23:19.466 --> 23:21.634
Look, I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you

23:21.668 --> 23:24.070
for coming out
and everything, I really am.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.605
But, Derek, you know
that's not the only reason

23:25.638 --> 23:26.939
why we're not together.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.642
Okay, I get it.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.611
You spent a half an hour
in rehab,

23:31.644 --> 23:33.446
and now you're better
than everybody.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.482
That's not what I mean,
but if that's the way

23:35.515 --> 23:37.249
that you gonna take it,
I don't even care.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.785
Is Philip putting all this
garbage in your head?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.052
Philip? Oh, my goodness,
are you serious?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.053
Yes.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.490
Babe, he is jealous.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.124
He is jealous
of our life.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.459
He's jealous
because his life

23:46.493 --> 23:49.128
is nowhere near as
exciting as ours.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.564
Yeah, well, Philip left me
because there's a difference

23:51.598 --> 23:52.899
between exciting and messy.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.668
Messy?

23:55.702 --> 23:58.270
Babe, was it messy

23:58.304 --> 24:01.240
when I helped you create some of
the best music in your career?

24:01.273 --> 24:04.944
Look, man, I'm-a always remember
what we created, okay?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.681
But that was
a dark time for me.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.683
I don't want
to go back there.

24:10.717 --> 24:14.787
And if you really care about me,
then you need to back off.

24:14.821 --> 24:15.988
Babe.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.290
Back off.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.935
THIRSTY: And how many
alcoholic beverages

24:28.968 --> 24:31.504
had you already consumed by the
time you arrived at Laviticus?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.105
I don't know. Two?

24:33.139 --> 24:36.543
Uh, two glasses or two bottles?

24:38.177 --> 24:39.546
Maybe three glasses.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.614
THIRSTY: Uh-huh.
And was this an open bar

24:41.648 --> 24:43.049
or did you
pay for those yourself?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.450
HAKEEM:
No. She mooched off

24:44.483 --> 24:45.852
the bottle service like
the rest of the chicks.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.053
May I remind
your client, please...

24:47.086 --> 24:48.187
THIRSTY: Yeah,
apologies, apologies.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.989
Hakeem, please let
Miss Marshall--

24:50.022 --> 24:51.123
Can I call you Kennedy?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.458
Let Kennedy answer
the questions.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.860
You know what?

24:53.893 --> 24:56.128
Let's shelf the liquor talk.
I mean, who keeps count when

24:56.162 --> 24:57.496
you're having a good time?
Speaking of which,

24:57.530 --> 24:59.566
this is a photograph
from your friend April's,

24:59.599 --> 25:01.934
uh, Instagram account.
Do you recognize it?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.071
Yes, but...

25:05.104 --> 25:07.206
No, but your friend posts
a photo of you embracing

25:07.239 --> 25:09.041
the alleged assailant.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.911
And you acknowledge that
it's, uh, time stamped

25:11.944 --> 25:13.846
one hour before the
alleged attack?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.215
I guess so, yeah.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.718
Yeah. You do make a cute couple.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.720
Let me ask you
another question.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.989
Is it true that you were once
kicked out of a place

25:23.022 --> 25:24.056
called Club Surrender?

25:24.090 --> 25:24.991
KENNEDY:
I don't see

25:25.024 --> 25:26.158
what this has to do
with anything.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.359
I-I know you don't.
It's all right.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.494
But, uh, why were you
kicked out?

25:28.527 --> 25:31.497
I got into an argument.
An argument?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.000
A little confused.
The police report said,

25:34.033 --> 25:35.735
"A violent altercation
with an employee

25:35.768 --> 25:37.604
with whom you once had
a prior sexual encounter."

25:37.637 --> 25:38.771
Is that right?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.206
Is that a booty
call, huh?
He hit me.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.875
Hakeem, you saw it.
You know he did.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.210
THERESA: Kennedy....
Hakeem, you know what happened!

25:44.243 --> 25:45.377
THIRSTY:
I'm confused here.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.013
Is my client
now a character witness?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.380
The fact of the matter is

25:48.414 --> 25:49.381
you have a history
of this.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.283
You sleep with men,
and then later on

25:51.317 --> 25:52.919
claim it's assault.
Is that safe to say?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.787
Do not answer that question,
Kennedy. You are putting words

25:54.821 --> 25:55.922
into my client's mouth,
Mr. Rawlings.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.556
Please, then let her
answer the question.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.558
How about it, Kennedy? Don't
let me put 'em in your mouth.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.427
In your own words, how about
it? What's going on here?

26:01.460 --> 26:03.029
Ease up, Thirsty.
Hakeem, we're doing fine.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.864
I don't need your help.
Now, please,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.766
instruct your client
to answer the question.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.434
Serious allegations,
little girl. What's
going on, Kennedy?

26:08.467 --> 26:09.702
You need a hug?

26:09.736 --> 26:11.604
(Thirsty's voice
overlapping, echoing)

26:11.638 --> 26:13.806
This money's not gonna
come easy. Maybe you do.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.218
(sighs)
It was the worst timing, Jamal.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.255
I mean, the day
of the primary elections?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.456
What'd they call you? Coocious?

26:30.489 --> 26:32.759
Shut up, boy.
Ma, it's gonna be okay.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.394
Not funny,
and it's not gonna be fine.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.229
I had Porsha
check all the blogs.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.298
And there it was,
everywhere!

26:39.331 --> 26:40.499
Coocious!

26:40.532 --> 26:42.334
Sounds like a damn STD.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.435
(sighs)

26:43.469 --> 26:46.138
And now Angelo is butt-hurt.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.840
Yeah, well, I mean,
they all get butt-hurt.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.141
Ma, he gonna be all right.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.677
Here.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.113
The people are getting
the wrong message, boy.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.915
They think everything
was coming up roses

26:55.948 --> 26:57.116
between me and Lucious,

26:57.149 --> 26:59.251
and that's a lie,
so I think

26:59.285 --> 27:01.153
we should release another teaser

27:01.187 --> 27:03.289
showing how much
of a snake your daddy is.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.423
Oh, my goodness.
Tell 'em the truth.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.591
No, Ma.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.493
That's the point
of a teaser is to,

27:07.526 --> 27:09.095
is to tease.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.930
Look, if you and Angelo
are really strong,

27:10.963 --> 27:12.298
he shouldn't be
worried about

27:12.331 --> 27:14.533
Lucious or Coocious
or Tom, Dick or Harry.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.002
Boy.
It's fine.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.469
You done with that.
You done moved on.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.637
That's the point
of all this, right?

27:18.671 --> 27:20.673
Me and Angelo are just fine.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.942
And he knows
that I am just

27:22.975 --> 27:24.476
with him now, so...

27:24.510 --> 27:25.845
Good, and he better
act right, too,

27:25.878 --> 27:27.313
'cause I voted
for him.
Mm.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.547
HAKEEM:
Ma, I told Thirsty

27:28.580 --> 27:30.182
to fall back, and he wouldn't.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.284
Now, I think Kennedy
gonna wig out on us.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.986
Calm down.
What's wrong?
Why are your panties in a bunch?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.321
Didn't she drop the case?

27:35.354 --> 27:37.156
No, 'cause Thirsty went hard
at her, and she kind of

27:37.189 --> 27:39.058
fell apart.
You know what?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.259
I got to do what's right.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.194
What do you mean
by victim blaming?

27:42.228 --> 27:43.195
What's that?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.496
It's what you do.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.799
You remember your song
"Can't Truss 'Em"?

27:46.833 --> 27:49.001
Or-or "The Clap Back,"
where you dragged Tiana

27:49.035 --> 27:50.336
for filth?

27:50.369 --> 27:51.403
You were consistently
making music

27:51.437 --> 27:52.504
where you make it
seem like-like

27:52.538 --> 27:53.906
it's the woman's fault;
and your fans,

27:53.940 --> 27:55.908
they treat the women that way
because they look up to you.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.209
It's not my fault
how other people act.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.077
No, that's bull.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.011
I'm serious.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.512
You remember that little
homophobic rant

28:00.546 --> 28:02.214
that you threw against me
right in my own damn house?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.350
You-you know how many
threats I got after that?

28:04.383 --> 28:07.053
Bro, I didn't know.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.221
COOKIE: See, Hakeem,
you think just because

28:09.255 --> 28:11.891
you're a father now of
a daughter that you can't be

28:11.924 --> 28:13.993
a misogynistic pig.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.562
Music is very powerful, son.
Very powerful.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.330
JAMAL:
Look, man,

28:18.364 --> 28:20.166
you on your way to
being woke, all right?

28:20.199 --> 28:23.035
You also have an opportunity
to change the message,

28:23.069 --> 28:24.436
make some music that
means something.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.438
I can't. Andre shut down
my XStream channel.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.374
COOKIE:
Jamal has more followers

28:28.407 --> 28:30.009
on his channel.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.911
After he released
his damn teaser

28:31.944 --> 28:35.114
from his album. So...

28:38.818 --> 28:40.619
But you ain't heard it from me.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.621
(mellow hip-hop music playing)

28:42.654 --> 28:44.356
HAKEEM:
You're special.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.726
And I just want you to know.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.264

29:15.087 --> 29:17.289

get 'em out of they draws *

29:17.323 --> 29:18.724
* Instead of
bringing them down *

29:18.757 --> 29:20.059

bringing them up *

29:20.092 --> 29:21.327

29:21.360 --> 29:23.595

Hey, right there
goes to Kennedy,

30:34.066 --> 30:35.534
who didn't deserve what she got.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.069
And for my baby, Tiana,

30:37.103 --> 30:39.505
who deserves a dude who knows
what's happening in this world.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.307
And for my baby, Bella,

30:41.340 --> 30:44.176
who ain't never gonna go through
what Kennedy had to go through.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.312
For the ladies
in the world--

30:46.345 --> 30:47.513
I mean, women.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.847
Keem.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.349
(door opens)
TIANA: Keem,

30:50.382 --> 30:51.984
baby, that was amazing.
Was it?

30:52.018 --> 30:53.385
I am so proud of you.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.820
(chuckles)

30:54.853 --> 30:56.822
Kennedy's gonna appreciate it
so much. Thank you.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.424
HAKEEM:
That's for you, baby.
What the hell

30:58.457 --> 31:00.092
you think
you're doing?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.260
I shut your channel down.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.361
He's on my
channel, not his.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.462
Beside the point.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.032
I didn't shut you down
to be a jerk.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.666
I did it to protect Empire.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.101
You just undid that

31:09.135 --> 31:11.403
by making a public
admission of guilt.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.438
And for my baby, Tiana...

31:12.471 --> 31:13.839
I had to call
a board meeting tomorrow

31:13.872 --> 31:15.441
to discuss
how we're gonna respond.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.209
You didn't
have to do that.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.911
Anyway, Dad's sick, man.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.247
Well, we'll just have to
go ahead without him now.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.616
Won't we?

31:34.093 --> 31:35.727
(doorbell rings)
Juanita, what's going on?

31:35.761 --> 31:36.963
Is my dad okay?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.397
They're all up there already.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.232
They all?
Yes.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.800
All of them.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.308
LUCIOUS:
Andre.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.880
I heard you
wanted to have

31:54.913 --> 31:57.883
a meeting, so I...

31:57.916 --> 31:59.485
invited everyone.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.490
I was just taking care of
business so you wouldn't

32:04.523 --> 32:06.058
have to get involved with
this in your condition,

32:06.092 --> 32:07.859
Pop, that's all.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.299
(chuckles): You were never
any good at lying, son.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.615
Well, since we're all here,
unexpectedly,

32:29.648 --> 32:31.683
I... I do have
something I'd like

32:31.717 --> 32:34.920
to discuss, something that
would require board approval.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.124
That is,
if you're up to it, Pop.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.891
I'm all ears.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.862
I've been working on

32:43.895 --> 32:45.497
an investment deal
for Empire artists

32:45.531 --> 32:47.866
to do a series of residencies
in Las Vegas.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.101
Vegas?

32:49.135 --> 32:50.302
MAN:
Las Vegas, really?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.006
ANDRE: I have some
preliminary numbers here

32:54.040 --> 32:55.741
that demonstrate profitability.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.617
LUCIOUS: I think I made
my position very clear with you

33:05.651 --> 33:06.818
regarding Vegas.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.720
But you never
explained why, Pop.

33:08.754 --> 33:12.324
I'm not gonna lie,
it seems whimsical.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.859
Now that we're a public company,
we can't afford

33:13.892 --> 33:15.194
to be dictated by your whims.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.029
I'm sorry.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.197
(quiet murmuring)

33:25.204 --> 33:27.073
These projections
are outstanding.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.907
Can they hold up
across multiple quarters?

33:28.940 --> 33:31.077
Absolutely. That's the beauty
of Las Vegas, Leonard.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.811
It's an evergreen proposition.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.246
COOKIE:
Yeah, but, Andre,

33:34.280 --> 33:35.647
what business
do we have at Vegas?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.183
We're a hip-hop label.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.985
Well, Vegas isn't just Liberace
and Wayne Newton anymore, Ma.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.487
It's JLo.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.322
Bruno Mars,
The Weeknd, you name it.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.923
And it should be Empire.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.825
It must be Empire.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.096
Well...

33:50.129 --> 33:52.931
I guess it's
all settled, then.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.205
You're fired.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.006
JAMAL:
Okay, everybody slow down.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.208
Let's just table this

34:02.241 --> 34:04.243
until you're
feeling better.
Jamal.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.248
I'm an officer
of the company, Pop.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.851
And this is
a board meeting.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.654
You're gonna need a second
for your motion to fire me.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.194
All righty.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.230
Do I hear a second?

34:26.898 --> 34:30.802
I said, do I have a second?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.585
Cookie.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.254
Why are you firing him, Lucious?

34:48.287 --> 34:50.055
Have you even looked at this?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.591
Insubordination.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.960
Dad, you just need to
get some rest, okay?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.766
Shine.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.135
XStream finally
making money, L.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.337
Andre's killing it.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.540
And this Vegas thing,
it sounds smart.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.182
He is my son.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.083
And I will fire him

35:18.116 --> 35:20.152
if I want to.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.188
LEONARD:
We stand behind Andre.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.425
Investors crave
stability, Lucious.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.794
The company can't afford
any more shakeups right now.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.329
Thank you, Leonard.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.931
Let's get a press release out,
immediately.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.367
I look forward to working with
you all to expanding Empire

35:35.401 --> 35:37.503
into this lucrative
new market.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.607
Get out

35:41.640 --> 35:43.875
of my house.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.115
Every one of you.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.583
Get out.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.555
Well done.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.391
You really need
to look at this, Lucious.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.427
The boy is onto something.

36:16.208 --> 36:20.512
* I feel it coming,
I feel it coming, babe *

36:20.546 --> 36:23.181
* I feel it coming *

36:23.215 --> 36:26.151
* I feel it coming, babe... *

36:26.184 --> 36:28.654
NEWSCASTER: The polls
are about to close for

36:28.687 --> 36:30.822
the New York City
mayoral primary election.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.491
It's a tight race

36:32.524 --> 36:34.993
between Councilman Angelo
DuBois and John Meeks.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.662
We will bring you the
results...
ANDRE: Mom?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.764
Hey, you.
Hey.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.166
(chuckles)

36:41.199 --> 36:42.768
I wanted to thank you,

36:42.801 --> 36:44.870
for backing me up
on that Vegas deal.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.505
It's good for Empire.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.074
I hope it is good for you.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.542
You're smart.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.011
Oh, come on.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.780
The way you capitalized
on the fact

36:54.813 --> 36:57.249
that your father
was laid up. (laughs)

36:57.283 --> 36:59.351
Oh. Kind of like you and Jamal?

36:59.385 --> 37:02.854
Dropping that teaser
while he was laid up?

37:02.888 --> 37:06.091
Well, I haven't heard a peep
about Inferno, have you?

37:06.124 --> 37:08.894
DuBois' momentum
crashed to a halt, however,

37:08.927 --> 37:12.264
when it surfaced that he was
previously arrested for a DUI,

37:12.298 --> 37:14.400
a charge that his upper crust
family attempted to...

37:14.433 --> 37:15.701
It's gonna be
a close one.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.569
Yeah, my toes
and my fingers are crossed.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.871
(chuckles)
Yeah, mine, too.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.973
I'm gonna go track down Nessa.
Mm. Okay.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.910
My man.
Hey.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.812
Thanks for being here.
All right.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.213
Hey, watch your back.
Hey, pretty lady.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.916
How are you? (giggles)

37:30.949 --> 37:33.452
...nothing is out of the realm
of possibility in this arena.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.387
ANGELO: Everything okay
with you and Dre?

37:35.421 --> 37:37.589
Everything is great with me
and Dre. Don't worry about me.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.725
Okay.
You need to be worried
about Sunset Park.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.160
ANGELO: Oh, I ain't worried
about no Sunset Park.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.229
It's a bunch of white people
who can't afford Park Slope.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.497
Shh. (laughs)

37:45.531 --> 37:47.065
I got it on lock.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.167
Hey, thank you.
Yeah. You got me
on lock, too.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.802
Do I?
Yes.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.439
Mm. And, look, about
that Coocious,

37:53.472 --> 37:55.741
it's something you
put on a T-shirt.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.142
What we have
is very real.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.243
All right.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.845
(Cookie chuckles)

37:59.878 --> 38:01.647
ANGELO:
Ooh.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.981
Let's get used to this.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.015
(applause, cheering)
Okay.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.116
Did they announce?

38:05.150 --> 38:06.618
WOMAN:
Lucious!

38:06.652 --> 38:08.520
MAN:
Hey, Lucious Lyon!

38:08.554 --> 38:10.221
What? Did they
say Lucious?
What's going on?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.292
I thought you said
he wasn't...

38:14.326 --> 38:16.094
(clears throat)
Mr. Lyon.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.797
What brings you
from your coffin?

38:18.830 --> 38:21.600
I decided it was in
my best interest to chance it.

38:21.633 --> 38:25.437
Make sure nobody else
was making moves on me.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.840
This is a nice little party
you decided to throw here.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.008
What, you do it

38:30.041 --> 38:31.042
to make up
for that, um--

38:31.076 --> 38:33.311
What are they calling us now?

38:33.345 --> 38:34.613
"Coochie-us"?

38:34.646 --> 38:36.181
Coocious. Yeah.
Uh, mm-hmm.

38:36.214 --> 38:37.315
ANGELO (chuckles):
Coocious. It's cute.

38:37.349 --> 38:40.285
I have to admit,
that teaser was a bit inspired.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.287
ANGELO:
Listen, Mr. Lyon,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.790
thank you so much
for letting us use this space.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.957
Very, very generous of you.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.459
Appreciate it.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.461
Yeah, I'm nothing
if I'm not generous.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.963
Actually generous enough
that when you lose tonight,

38:51.997 --> 38:53.331
which he's gonna do,

38:53.365 --> 38:55.200
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.668
This guy. That's a bet.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.872
Eh. Might be contagious.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.012
You're not gonna believe
the money we're gonna make

39:07.045 --> 39:08.814
on this Vegas deal.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.649
We'll be able to get that
penthouse I told you about.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.352
Mm. So there will be room
for me, you and Giuliana?

39:16.555 --> 39:17.989
What?

39:18.023 --> 39:20.492
Oh, you're confused?

39:20.526 --> 39:22.494
You told that woman
we have an arrangement

39:22.528 --> 39:23.595
that we didn't discuss.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.863
Did we have to?

39:26.432 --> 39:28.567
This is how
I do business, Nessa.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.337
It's how you and Rhonda did
business, and I am not Rhonda.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.272
So, if you want me signing
anything with you,

39:34.305 --> 39:38.176
a Vegas contract, an apartment
lease, I don't care what it is,

39:38.209 --> 39:41.279
I do not do "arrangements."

39:41.312 --> 39:43.048
I hope we're clear.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.691
Okay, here we go.
All right, y'all.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.059
Well, the wait is finally over.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.562
With more than 75%
of precincts reporting,

39:56.595 --> 40:00.466
we are prepared to call the
Democratic mayoral primary...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.270
...for New York City Councilman
Angelo DuBois.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.972
(screams)
(crowd cheering)

40:07.005 --> 40:08.039
Yes.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.976
("Good Times" by Chic playing)

40:11.009 --> 40:12.043
ANGELO:
You told me.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.411
Come on, get up there.
Thank y'all.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.547
You have a speech to give.
Okay. All right.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.082
Yes, thank you.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.217
All right, we did it.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.452
We coming! We coming!

40:20.486 --> 40:21.453
(crowd cheering)

40:21.487 --> 40:23.054
(Angelo whoops)

40:23.088 --> 40:24.790
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.659
I realize we have
a long road ahead of us,

40:27.693 --> 40:29.661
before we get
to that general election,

40:29.695 --> 40:30.762
but we made it this far, right?

40:30.796 --> 40:32.230
(crowd cheering)
Yes!

40:32.263 --> 40:35.300
Thank you for the staying up
late and making that coffee...

40:35.333 --> 40:36.835
LUCIOUS: Let's give
it up to the next

40:36.868 --> 40:41.573
mayor of New York City,
Mr. Angelo DuBois.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.475
(crowd cheers)
Thank you, Mr. Lyon.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.610
Ain't that a bitch.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.745
You know, sometimes,

40:46.778 --> 40:48.113
you're forced
to eat a little crow.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.815
(chuckles):
We need to-- Hey.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.483
As many of you know,
I actually endorsed

40:51.517 --> 40:53.485
his opponent,

40:53.519 --> 40:54.986
John Meeks.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.022
That's why I'm gonna
take a little credit

40:57.055 --> 40:59.124
for his win tonight.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.326
I believe the challenge
that I set before this man

41:01.359 --> 41:03.428
made him
a much better candidate.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.331
And as a result,
allowed us to focus

41:06.364 --> 41:08.366
on his incredible message.

41:08.399 --> 41:13.038
And Empire is proud to be
friends with the future mayor

41:13.071 --> 41:15.040
of New York City,
Angelo DuBois.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.042
And again, thank you, Mr. Lyon.
All right, thank you.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.945
Thank you.
LUCIOUS: And in honor
of this great victory...

41:19.978 --> 41:21.379
ANGELO:
Look at this guy.

41:21.412 --> 41:22.981
...I would like to play
a song for y'all.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.950
This is a song
that I wrote

41:24.983 --> 41:27.185
for that beautiful woman
standing next to him,

41:27.218 --> 41:29.688
many, many years ago.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.693
(classical version of
"You're So Beautiful" playing)

41:43.669 --> 41:45.704
*

41:59.685 --> 42:03.689
* You're so beautiful *

42:03.722 --> 42:05.691
May I have this dance?

42:05.724 --> 42:09.895
(hip-hop version):
* You're so beautiful *

42:09.928 --> 42:12.731
* You got me watching you,
like a camera do *

42:12.764 --> 42:15.734
* I still wait for you *

42:15.767 --> 42:18.269
(moaning, panting)

42:18.303 --> 42:20.438
* You got me... *

42:20.471 --> 42:22.440
(laughing)

42:22.473 --> 42:24.710
You're always
did it for me.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.245
* You got me watching you... *

42:27.278 --> 42:30.015
You never stopped
doing it for me.

42:30.048 --> 42:33.685
* I still wait for you. *

42:33.719 --> 42:36.722
("You're So Beautiful"
continues playing on piano)

42:53.772 --> 42:55.774
(music stops)

43:00.145 --> 43:03.815
Why don't you play the song
you wrote for me, Lucious?

43:03.849 --> 43:06.151
You got a hell of a lot
of nerve coming here.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.654
Oh, come on, baby.
Play that song you wrote for me.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.990
You tell me why I shouldn't kill
you right where you're standing.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.159
You don't want to do that.

43:14.192 --> 43:17.595
I'm about to make
all our dreams come true.

43:59.905 --> 44:00.972
Yeah.

44:01.006 --> 44:03.008
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:05.543 --> 44:07.212
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.245 --> 44:10.015
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.051
(gunshot)

44:13.084 --> 44:15.353
Shots Fired is
a murder mystery.

44:15.386 --> 44:18.189
An African-American officer
kills an unarmed white guy.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.959
I asked him
to step out of the vehicle,
but as he steps out,

44:20.992 --> 44:23.194
he reaches for my gun,
and it was either him or me.

44:23.228 --> 44:24.696
-And I shot him.
-Four times.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.800
WOMAN: Preston and Ashe are
a prosecutor and an investigator

44:28.834 --> 44:30.568
come down to investigate.

44:30.601 --> 44:33.671
They uncover a second teenager
that was killed-- a black teen.

44:33.705 --> 44:37.208
Suddenly, there's these two
racially charged shootings
they're investigating.

44:37.242 --> 44:40.078
I play Ashe Akino.
She has lots of layers.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.213
She is not perfect.

44:42.247 --> 44:44.249
Sometimes she will do
whatever it takes

44:44.282 --> 44:46.417
to get what she wants
in a case.

44:46.451 --> 44:49.821
Preston's a graduate
from Harvard, working for
the Department of Justice.

44:49.855 --> 44:53.759
As the series progresses,
his idealism will be tested.

44:53.792 --> 44:56.527
All I care about is the truth,
and my truth has no color.

44:56.561 --> 44:59.097
A tragedy has come
to Gate Station,

44:59.130 --> 45:01.399
and when there are questions,
I want answers.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.335
Our mantra for the show
is get the audience
at the edge of their seat,

45:04.369 --> 45:06.137
and when they're
leaning forward,
hit 'em with the truth.
