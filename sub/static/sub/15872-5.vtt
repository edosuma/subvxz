Previously on
<i>The Lying Game...</i>

00:02.020 --> 00:03.887
She was asking a lot of questions about
her mother this summer, right?

00:04.167 --> 00:06.101
I told her what
I always tell her.

00:06.535 --> 00:07.769
(exhales):
The woman is dead.

00:07.803 --> 00:08.870
What are we gonna
tell her when

00:08.904 --> 00:10.405
she finds out
that isn't true?

00:10.439 --> 00:11.573
You didn't steal anything?

00:11.607 --> 00:12.540
You brought me love;

00:12.575 --> 00:14.509
just returning the favor.

00:14.543 --> 00:16.411
(camera shutter clicking)

00:16.445 --> 00:17.412
EDUARDO:
<i>We can't do this.</i>

00:17.446 --> 00:18.413
You should go.

00:18.447 --> 00:19.514
CHAR:
<i>When did</i>

00:19.548 --> 00:20.749
this happen?

00:20.783 --> 00:22.851
Since the first moment
I saw her.

00:22.885 --> 00:25.520
When Sutton gets back,
Ethan, what happens?

00:25.554 --> 00:27.455
You're Sutton's boyfriend.

00:27.490 --> 00:28.623
I know.

00:28.658 --> 00:30.725
THAYER:
<i>We're gonna get a read</i>

00:30.760 --> 00:32.427
on that water tower
behind your mom and Emma.

00:32.461 --> 00:34.496
SUTTON:
<i>Oh, my God, this is amazing.</i>

00:34.530 --> 00:37.599
That's my room.
My crib was right on that wall.

00:37.633 --> 00:39.467
I can't believe I'm
standing in the place

00:39.502 --> 00:40.535
where our mother lived.

00:40.569 --> 00:41.536
We used to fall asleep,

00:41.570 --> 00:42.604
staring at those stars.

00:42.638 --> 00:44.639
Wait, there's something there.

00:44.674 --> 00:47.776
Our mother's name
was Annie Hobbs.

00:47.810 --> 00:50.645
KRISTIN: <i>Everything looks great,</i>
<i>Phyllis.</i>

00:50.680 --> 00:53.448
I have to say, we've really
outdone ourselves this year.

00:53.482 --> 00:55.450
The kids are going
to be blown away.

00:55.484 --> 00:56.651
It gets bigger every year.

00:56.686 --> 00:58.787
Back in the day, ours
were just as big.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.488
(sighing):
Back in the day...

01:00.523 --> 01:02.524
I keep telling Char
to enjoy these things,

01:02.558 --> 01:03.591
these events.

01:03.626 --> 01:05.760
They all happen
so quickly.

01:05.795 --> 01:08.463
Wish I could get
my Char to run.

01:08.497 --> 01:09.798
Certainly has the time now.

01:09.832 --> 01:11.766
♪ ♪

01:41.931 --> 01:44.899
Somebody's been practicing.
Oh, don't stop <i>my</i>   account.

01:44.934 --> 01:48.903
So, they really go all out
for Homecoming here, huh?

01:48.938 --> 01:51.573
- Was it like this at your old school?
- I wouldn't know.

01:51.607 --> 01:52.907
You had to be asked.

01:52.942 --> 01:54.676
(chuckles):
Come on.

01:54.710 --> 01:57.579
Like guys weren't hitting
on you all the time.

01:57.613 --> 02:01.783
Unless you count my pervy
foster brother, Travis, no.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.651
My friend Lexi and I would
just go to the movies.

02:03.686 --> 02:04.853
I'm guessing...

02:04.887 --> 02:07.389
you're not going.

02:07.423 --> 02:08.556
Good guess.

02:08.591 --> 02:10.392
Yeah, you're right,

02:10.425 --> 02:12.727
these high school dances,
they're just so lame.

02:12.762 --> 02:14.496
You kind of looked like you were

02:14.530 --> 02:16.431
having a real good time
a second ago.

02:16.465 --> 02:17.599
That?
Yeah.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.402
Yeah, no, I was
just, I was just...

02:20.436 --> 02:21.770
I don't really
know what that was.

02:21.804 --> 02:23.405
(chuckles)
Yeah.

02:23.439 --> 02:24.539
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

02:24.573 --> 02:25.707
Okay, fine, I admit it,

02:25.741 --> 02:28.410
I do want to go to
this thing, but...

02:28.444 --> 02:29.644
it doesn't matter
what I want.

02:29.678 --> 02:30.845
What would Sutton want?

02:30.880 --> 02:33.715
Is she anti-Homecoming, too?

02:36.452 --> 02:37.819
KRISTIN:
<i>You are going to make</i>

02:37.853 --> 02:39.788
a beautiful
Homecoming Queen.

02:39.822 --> 02:41.423
I am?

02:41.457 --> 02:42.824
I know talking about it
jinxes it,

02:42.858 --> 02:45.593
but you'd better get
some posters up--

02:45.628 --> 02:46.694
I've seen Nisha's
everywhere.

02:46.729 --> 02:48.496
And what about those
catchy slogans

02:48.531 --> 02:50.432
you and Char
came up with?

02:50.466 --> 02:51.866
Oh...

02:51.901 --> 02:55.670
we... have to work out
some of the kinks.

02:55.704 --> 02:57.672
What is this?

02:57.706 --> 02:59.774
The school has
asked for photos

02:59.809 --> 03:01.476
from past years' dances.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.744
(both laugh)

03:02.778 --> 03:04.813
You look beautiful.

03:04.847 --> 03:06.481
Thank you.

03:06.515 --> 03:08.450
Your dad and Alec,

03:08.484 --> 03:10.485
they were big men on campus.

03:10.519 --> 03:12.387
- (chuckles): Oh-ho...
- Kind of cheesy.

03:12.421 --> 03:13.822
Yeah, that hair.

03:13.856 --> 03:15.623
Oh.

03:15.658 --> 03:18.526
There's you.
Two days old.

03:18.561 --> 03:19.761
Hmm.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.768
(whispers):
So sweet.

03:36.479 --> 03:38.580
(thunder rumbling in distance)

03:39.682 --> 03:42.617
(water drips into can)

03:45.588 --> 03:49.457
Guess how many Annie Hobbs
there are in the world.

03:49.492 --> 03:52.427
523 in the continental
U.S. alone.

03:53.829 --> 03:55.797
How did you find these?

03:55.831 --> 03:58.666
(sighs): Uh... you don't
want to know how easy it is

03:58.701 --> 04:00.668
to steal Social Security
numbers off the Internet.

04:00.703 --> 04:02.637
You did this when
I was in the shower?

04:02.671 --> 04:04.539
No. Last night.

04:04.573 --> 04:06.774
I couldn't sleep,
so it was either that

04:06.809 --> 04:08.743
or watch the
Hoarders marathon.

04:08.777 --> 04:10.645
So what's next?

04:10.679 --> 04:12.714
We need to cross-reference
with DMV records

04:12.748 --> 04:16.451
state by state, see if we can get
a picture off a driver's license.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.620
Okay. Well, Emma was in
foster care in Nevada,

04:18.654 --> 04:20.454
so let's start there.

04:20.488 --> 04:22.790
(thunder rumbling)
Okay.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.794
SUTTON: How long is
this rain gonna last?

04:26.829 --> 04:29.597
Day or two.

04:29.632 --> 04:32.834
The roof leaks, but...
it's kind of cozy, right?

04:34.537 --> 04:36.538
I guess.

05:15.711 --> 05:17.679
You're not going to
the dance, period.

05:17.713 --> 05:19.754
He's running for Homecoming King--
he needs my support.

05:19.755 --> 05:21.289
What he needs
is a miracle.

05:21.383 --> 05:22.750
- He's new at school, right?
- Yes.

we should root for the underdog?

05:25.654 --> 05:27.388

Mom, you know how important
Homecoming is.

05:29.758 --> 05:31.426
I think your father's right.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.694
You stole your
sister's laptop.

05:32.728 --> 05:34.762
You tried to blame
an innocent kid.

05:34.797 --> 05:37.498
You can't expect us to pretend
like it didn't happen.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.400
So unfair!

05:40.736 --> 05:42.537
So?

05:43.639 --> 05:45.607
Parole denied.

05:45.641 --> 05:48.343
(groans):
Oh! I was hoping...

05:48.377 --> 05:49.611
What, you were worried
I was going

05:49.645 --> 05:50.678
to miss your acceptance speech?

05:50.713 --> 05:52.614
Right. Acceptance speech.

05:52.648 --> 05:54.515
Hey, Laurel.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.784
You've done

05:56.819 --> 05:58.786
so much for me and Ethan,

05:58.821 --> 06:01.456
you know, the whole
laptop confession...

06:01.490 --> 06:03.558
I... can't go without you.

06:03.592 --> 06:05.426
It wouldn't be fair.

06:05.461 --> 06:07.495
- You'll get over it.
- No, I won't.

06:07.529 --> 06:09.497
I won't. So I'm
not gonna go.

06:09.531 --> 06:10.665
I'm gonna skip the dance.

06:10.699 --> 06:12.533
Sister solidarity.

06:12.568 --> 06:14.769
Right? And...
we'll stay here,

06:14.803 --> 06:17.538
we'll do makeovers,
eat junk food...

06:17.573 --> 06:19.540
And what about the grand plan?

06:19.575 --> 06:21.509
Sutton Mercer wins Queen
junior year,

06:21.543 --> 06:22.710
wins again senior year.

06:22.745 --> 06:24.545
By the way, you pull that off,

06:24.580 --> 06:26.681
and you'll get your own shelf
in the trophy case.

06:26.715 --> 06:28.549
Right now you're more important.

06:28.584 --> 06:30.585
Seriously, if you
hadn't come forward

06:30.619 --> 06:33.388
like you did,
Ethan would be in jail.

06:33.422 --> 06:36.357
(sighs)

06:37.359 --> 06:39.494
Well, I suppose you do owe me.

06:39.528 --> 06:40.628
Exactly.

06:40.663 --> 06:42.530
So girls' night, it is.

06:46.535 --> 06:48.603
MADS:
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

06:48.637 --> 06:50.838
I missed you
at rehearsal last night.

06:52.574 --> 06:54.709
I tweaked a hamstring
in gym class, so...

06:54.743 --> 06:56.811
I thought I'd
give it a rest.

06:56.845 --> 06:58.413
So you're okay, then?

06:58.447 --> 06:59.747
I mean, after what happened.

06:59.782 --> 07:02.583
I kissed you;
I shouldn't have done that.

07:02.618 --> 07:06.287
Look, Mads, I think you are
an amazing dancer, and...

07:06.321 --> 07:08.456
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.724
Not with the recital
coming up.

07:09.758 --> 07:12.360
I came over to see if
there was a... a problem.

07:12.394 --> 07:14.629
You could have told me
all that over the phone.

07:14.663 --> 07:16.698
ALEC (calls):
Mads, I'm home.

07:16.732 --> 07:19.367
(quietly):
You stay in here.

07:19.401 --> 07:21.302
Why? We weren't
doing anything.

07:21.336 --> 07:23.738
You know my dad--
if he finds me with you, he'll freak.

07:23.772 --> 07:25.473
Hey, Dad.

07:26.475 --> 07:27.742
Hey, honey.

07:27.776 --> 07:30.745
Hey. I thought you didn't
get back until tomorrow.

07:30.779 --> 07:32.513
Uh, the conference
wrapped up early,

07:32.548 --> 07:34.382
and I took
an early flight home.

07:34.416 --> 07:36.551
- Oh.
- You okay?

07:36.585 --> 07:38.386
- Mm-hmm.
- You feel a little warm.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.520
(smacks lips)

07:39.555 --> 07:41.589
Might be coming down
with something.

07:41.623 --> 07:44.492
- Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going around.
- Yeah, yeah, I hear.

07:44.526 --> 07:47.328
- You good enough to go to school?
- Uh, yeah.

07:47.362 --> 07:48.629
All right, go get ready.

07:48.664 --> 07:50.531
I got some calls to make.

08:00.743 --> 08:02.710
(phone rings)

08:02.745 --> 08:04.512
Hello?

08:04.546 --> 08:06.547
Dr. Hughes, it's Alec Rybak.

08:06.582 --> 08:08.649
Did you check
Annie Hobbs day log?

08:08.684 --> 08:10.685
Yes, and she hasn't had
any visitors

08:10.719 --> 08:12.754
since the last time
you were here.

08:12.788 --> 08:14.522
You're absolutely certain?

08:14.556 --> 08:16.524
Our security's airtight.

08:16.558 --> 08:18.659
For what I'm paying,
it'd better be.

08:18.694 --> 08:20.661
This visitor
you're concerned about,

08:20.696 --> 08:23.431
will it be a man or a woman?

08:23.465 --> 08:24.632
It's a girl. Teenager.

08:24.666 --> 08:26.501
She calls herself Sutton Mercer.

08:26.535 --> 08:27.668
Now, I'm guessing

08:27.703 --> 08:29.504
she's looking
for a payday.

08:29.538 --> 08:31.572
She's gonna be making
a lot of crazy claims.

08:31.607 --> 08:34.408
I can send you a picture,
if that'd be helpful.

08:34.443 --> 08:35.510
Got it.

08:35.544 --> 08:36.611
Sutton Mercer.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.779
Thank you, Doctor.

08:47.489 --> 08:50.391
Keep an eye out
(rustling from other room)

08:51.460 --> 08:53.361
Mads?

09:06.862 --> 09:09.295
Your sister's pulling out.
Why should I?

09:09.296 --> 09:11.063
For the exact same reason.
Well, because...

09:11.097 --> 09:12.965
because, because I should
totally be dating

09:12.999 --> 09:14.967
the Homecoming King.

09:15.001 --> 09:18.103
<i>Oh.</i> The truth
finally comes out.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.139
Let me put it
another way.

09:20.173 --> 09:23.209
This is the social
equivalent to...

09:23.243 --> 09:25.211
winning the Masters.

09:25.245 --> 09:27.213
But instead of getting
a green jacket,

09:27.247 --> 09:30.816
you go from transfer student
to Arroyo's hottest bachelor.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.886
Mm. But...

09:33.920 --> 09:35.821
I'm taken.

09:35.855 --> 09:37.990
Taken?

09:38.024 --> 09:41.827
God, that does have a
wonderful ring to it. (chuckles)

09:41.861 --> 09:43.295
Look, you do realize
the guys from the team

09:43.330 --> 09:45.197
put me on the ballot
as a joke, right?

09:45.232 --> 09:47.299
General pop
doesn't know that.

09:47.334 --> 09:50.102
All they know is that you're
new and cute and interesting.

09:50.136 --> 09:51.870
Now...

09:51.905 --> 09:55.274
what you need is a good
campaign manager...

09:55.308 --> 09:57.910
and luckily, my services
are available.

09:57.944 --> 09:59.178
(laughs)

09:59.212 --> 10:02.181

visibility.

10:02.215 --> 10:04.183
LAUREL:
Vote Justin for Homecoming King.

10:04.217 --> 10:06.919
(whispers):
Vote for him.

10:12.225 --> 10:15.294
Hey, I can't believe you're
dropping out of the race.

10:15.328 --> 10:17.229
Nisha's got virtually
no competition,

10:17.264 --> 10:19.031
and if she wins,

10:19.065 --> 10:20.366
I can't even imagine.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.901
Okay, well, if it means
that much to her,

10:22.936 --> 10:24.003
maybe we should just...

10:24.037 --> 10:26.138
Let her win.
Are you kidding?

10:26.172 --> 10:28.207
We'd be creating
a monster.

10:28.241 --> 10:30.142
I'm doing it for Laurel, okay?

10:30.176 --> 10:33.045
She's so bummed that
she's missing the dance.

10:33.079 --> 10:35.114
Hey, guys. I'm gonna hit
the plaza after school.

10:35.148 --> 10:37.182
Shop for a Homecoming dress--
who wants to join?

10:37.217 --> 10:40.152
For you, I'm thinking purple:
very regal, very Kate Middleton.

10:40.186 --> 10:41.987
Sutton's not running.

10:42.022 --> 10:43.922
Right. So, like I was saying,
something totally royal,

10:43.957 --> 10:45.190
with just a hint
of the unexpected.

10:45.225 --> 10:49.128
Char, no, really,
I'm sitting this one out.

10:50.063 --> 10:52.231
I don't get it.

10:52.265 --> 10:54.266
We've been planning your
campaign since eighth grade.

10:54.301 --> 10:56.235
I'm the Pippa
to your Kate, remember?

10:56.269 --> 10:57.970
I've got four campaign
posters in the works.

10:58.004 --> 11:00.873
My mom saw them and said,
why don't I run?

11:00.907 --> 11:02.141
Well, why <i>don't</i> you run?
Sutton,

11:02.175 --> 11:04.877
I told you a million times,
I'm a behind-the-scenes girl.

11:04.911 --> 11:06.312
Ladies, looking lovely.

11:06.346 --> 11:08.247
Save it, Nisha, we're
not voting for you.

11:08.281 --> 11:09.982
Like I even
need your votes

11:10.016 --> 11:12.217
now that it's basically
a one-woman race.

11:12.252 --> 11:14.320
Was up for the competition,
Sutton, but

11:14.354 --> 11:17.289
I'm sure you have your
reasons for not running.

11:17.324 --> 11:19.925
And I assume you're bringing
your new boy toy to the dance,

11:19.959 --> 11:21.894
or is that

11:21.928 --> 11:23.062
still on the DL?

11:23.096 --> 11:24.963
Actually, I'm
going solo.

11:24.998 --> 11:26.131
But why don't
you ask Eduardo?

11:26.166 --> 11:27.900
Went so well last time.

11:27.934 --> 11:29.268
Please, the
dude is cute

11:29.302 --> 11:32.171
but hardly my type.
- Mm-hmm.

11:34.140 --> 11:37.242
Um... you're dating Eduardo?

11:37.277 --> 11:39.244
For, like,
six months.

11:39.279 --> 11:42.081
I guess I wasn't the only one
in the dark on this one.

11:42.115 --> 11:45.117
I just said I was to
save face with Nisha.

11:45.151 --> 11:47.086
Because
she likes him, too.

11:47.120 --> 11:51.056
And you know how she gets when
there's a trophy on the line.

11:54.294 --> 11:58.063
THAYER: No matches in
Nevada or Utah.

11:58.098 --> 11:59.965
Moving on
to Idaho.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.233
(typing)

12:01.267 --> 12:05.237
I was thinking,
what if Annie Hobbs is hiding

12:05.271 --> 12:08.907
from us, from me?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.942 --> 12:12.077
Have a little faith
in the ones and zeros.

12:12.112 --> 12:14.079
Okay, we are going
to track her down.

12:14.114 --> 12:16.115
What if she just
doesn't want to be found?

12:17.984 --> 12:20.052
Emma was right-- I should
just go back to Phoenix.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.955
I have wasted enough
of your time.

12:22.989 --> 12:24.957
You should really be working
on your app.

12:24.991 --> 12:28.961
Look, at least we have a decent
chance of finding Annie.

12:28.995 --> 12:30.095
Okay?

12:30.130 --> 12:31.330
As for me
creating

12:31.364 --> 12:34.199
the next Angry Birds,
look at me.

12:34.234 --> 12:38.103
I'm living in a leaky apartment,
taking handouts from my sister.

12:38.138 --> 12:40.372
(soda fizzing)

12:40.407 --> 12:43.976
Not exactly feeling
like the next Steve Jobs.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.277
Are you kidding?

12:45.311 --> 12:48.914
You are going to be
a huge success.

12:48.948 --> 12:51.316
- Sutton.
- No, seriously, really.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.018
You are super smart,

12:53.052 --> 12:55.320
and you are
the most dedicated guy I know.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.055
Honestly,
if it weren't for you,

12:57.090 --> 13:00.159
I would have given up
on this search so long ago.

13:00.193 --> 13:03.061
You have been amazing.

13:03.096 --> 13:05.931
I mean that, really.

13:06.966 --> 13:09.168
(thunder rumbling)

13:10.970 --> 13:12.938
Thayer, uh...

13:12.972 --> 13:14.973
(beep)
(thunder rumbling)

13:15.008 --> 13:19.978
Uh, I should go find
that circuit breaker.

13:25.084 --> 13:27.085
I'm starting to think

13:27.120 --> 13:30.289
that my dropping out of the race
is a big mistake.

13:30.323 --> 13:31.890
No, you're doing
the right thing.

13:31.925 --> 13:33.125
But no one
seems to buy

13:33.159 --> 13:35.928
that Sutton would give up
the chance to be queen.

13:35.962 --> 13:36.995
Because she wouldn't.

13:37.030 --> 13:38.130
So you're saying I should run?

13:38.164 --> 13:39.364
Personally, I
never understood

13:39.399 --> 13:41.934
why she was so into it
in the first place.

13:43.937 --> 13:47.072
Maybe I should just
ask her what to do.

13:47.106 --> 13:48.307
Every day

13:48.341 --> 13:52.044
I am here,
it's like I am losing

13:52.078 --> 13:53.912
a little piece
of myself.

13:53.947 --> 13:55.380
You're not.

13:55.415 --> 13:58.317
You're still Emma, and you're
never going to be Sutton.

13:58.351 --> 14:01.320
Gee, thanks
for the encouragement.

14:01.354 --> 14:04.189
I wasn't saying it
as a bad thing.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.194
Nice.

14:09.229 --> 14:11.897
Really, you think so?

14:11.931 --> 14:14.166
Definitely. Where'd you
learn to draw like this?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.969
Just kind of always
been able to do it.

14:17.003 --> 14:18.303
You're lucky.

14:18.338 --> 14:21.306
Only thing I was born with
was my dad's right hook.

14:21.341 --> 14:24.076
Oh...

14:24.110 --> 14:25.911
Oh, that's it.

14:25.945 --> 14:26.979
What, what's it?

14:27.013 --> 14:29.081
What if I got this
from my mother?

14:29.115 --> 14:33.986
No, Sutton found that mural
in my bedroom of the night sky.

14:34.020 --> 14:35.254
Those stars
weren't stenciled,

14:35.288 --> 14:37.990
They were painted
by my mother.

14:38.024 --> 14:39.358
She even signed it.

14:41.027 --> 14:44.129
What if Annie Hobbs
was an artist?

14:49.396 --> 14:51.564
Okay, that's all for today.
Thank you, girls.

14:51.837 --> 14:53.037
Hey, about this morning...

14:53.071 --> 14:55.105
We can't talk here.

14:59.711 --> 15:01.712
Mr. Rybak, what
a nice surprise.

15:01.746 --> 15:04.949
Hi, Nisha, I didn't
know you took ballet.

15:04.983 --> 15:06.750
I don't; just
dropping off a check

15:06.785 --> 15:08.953
for a few private lessons
I took with Eduardo.

15:08.987 --> 15:10.821
You must be so proud

15:10.856 --> 15:12.990
of Mads, having the lead
in the recital.

15:13.024 --> 15:14.314
Yeah.

15:14.339 --> 15:15.579
Between you and me,
I never believed

15:15.594 --> 15:17.628
the rumors
about her and Eduardo.

15:17.662 --> 15:20.598
What rumors?

15:20.632 --> 15:22.766
Oh.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.034
Whoops.

15:24.069 --> 15:25.736
Nisha.

15:25.770 --> 15:28.038
A rumor-- probably nothing
to it, nothing at all.

15:28.073 --> 15:29.607
I mean,
that's why

15:29.641 --> 15:31.942
they call them rumors, right?

15:31.977 --> 15:33.944
Right.

15:36.715 --> 15:38.949
What did she want?

15:38.984 --> 15:40.918
Nothing.

15:40.952 --> 15:42.753
No, she was just talking
about some crazy rumors

15:42.787 --> 15:44.054
about you
and Eduardo.

15:44.089 --> 15:46.023
She is so...

15:46.057 --> 15:47.758
I've already told you,

15:47.792 --> 15:49.894
there is nothing going on
between me and Eduardo.

15:49.928 --> 15:52.830
He's an amazing choreographer
and he's a perfect gentleman.

15:53.932 --> 15:56.000
Honey, it's
my experience,

15:56.034 --> 16:00.604
there is no such thing
as a perfect gentleman.

16:03.742 --> 16:05.643
Hey, you want
something to eat?

16:05.677 --> 16:07.545
No, I'll get
something later.

16:07.579 --> 16:09.813
Come on, sit down,
I made some steaks.

16:16.922 --> 16:20.624
So listen, uh...

16:20.659 --> 16:22.660
about the laptop,

16:22.694 --> 16:23.727
I'm sorry, you
were right,

16:23.762 --> 16:25.529
I should have
trusted you on that.

16:25.564 --> 16:27.631
Can't say it
surprises me that

16:27.666 --> 16:29.567
Laurel Mercer was behind it.

16:29.601 --> 16:31.602
Those sisters are
nothing but trouble.

16:31.636 --> 16:33.537
You don't know
anything about 'em.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.606
I know that I was almost
suspended last year without pay

16:35.640 --> 16:37.007
because of one
of Sutton's little lying games.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.876
She's different now.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.845
She cares more about people,

16:41.880 --> 16:45.816
about her family... about me.

16:45.850 --> 16:48.652
Is she still keeping you
a secret from her friends?

16:48.687 --> 16:50.654
So what if she is?

16:50.689 --> 16:52.957
I know that the last
thing you want to hear

16:52.991 --> 16:54.992
is my opinion.

16:56.595 --> 16:58.562
But I've been there.

16:58.597 --> 17:00.531
If someone's trying
to hide the fact

17:00.565 --> 17:01.732
that they're
with you,

17:01.766 --> 17:05.903
it's not
a real relationship, man.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.905
Girls like
Sutton Mercer--

17:07.939 --> 17:12.843
you can park their cars,
but you just can't date 'em.

17:15.847 --> 17:18.549
Come on, Sutton, where are you?

17:18.583 --> 17:19.683
(knocking)

17:19.718 --> 17:20.818
TED:
Hey, sport.

17:20.852 --> 17:22.553
Hi.
What are you doing?

17:22.587 --> 17:23.654
(clicking, beeping)

17:23.688 --> 17:26.589
I was picking out

17:26.625 --> 17:29.560
pictures of your Homecoming

17:29.594 --> 17:30.995
to send over
to the school.

17:31.029 --> 17:33.631
They're doing some sort
of display or something.

17:33.665 --> 17:36.800
(chuckles)

17:37.836 --> 17:40.738
Who talked me into a pink tie?

17:40.772 --> 17:43.674
Oh, wait, oh, that was me.

17:43.708 --> 17:44.808
Nice.

17:44.843 --> 17:45.943
(laughs)

17:45.977 --> 17:48.679
Live, you learn.

17:57.822 --> 17:59.890
Hmm.

17:59.924 --> 18:02.693
I love this picture.
Hmm.

18:02.727 --> 18:03.827
Who...

18:03.862 --> 18:05.562
took it again?

18:05.597 --> 18:07.498
I don't remember
what you had told me.

18:07.532 --> 18:10.634
The guy
from the adoption agency.

18:10.669 --> 18:13.971
Oh, right, right,
the baby broker.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.606
Baby broker?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.940
Honey, we used
an adoption agency.

18:16.975 --> 18:19.910
Okay.

18:19.944 --> 18:23.881
Hey, did the adoption
agency ever tell you

18:23.915 --> 18:26.650
what my birth mother
did for a living?

18:26.685 --> 18:28.786
Honey, we've been
over this.

18:28.820 --> 18:33.590
I know, just-- I don't know,
she could be anything.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.694
She could
have been, um,

18:36.728 --> 18:40.864
a doctor or a
waitress, artist.

18:40.899 --> 18:43.634
(phone ringing)
You'd better get that.

18:44.803 --> 18:46.770
(dry chuckle)

18:46.805 --> 18:49.707
(phone rings)

18:56.815 --> 18:58.816
Hello?

19:01.786 --> 19:03.754
(Emma gasps)

19:03.788 --> 19:07.791
Easy there, tiger, it's just us.

19:07.826 --> 19:09.827
(singsongy):
Check it out.

19:10.829 --> 19:11.962
Isn't it
fantastic?

19:11.996 --> 19:13.797
Char got the guy
at the copy shop

19:13.832 --> 19:15.799
to do the layout
for free.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.997
Had to show a little leg,
but it was totally worth it.

19:18.022 --> 19:19.113
Guys.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.804
I know you want to
stay home with Laurel,

19:20.805 --> 19:23.674
but Nisha crossed a line,
saying something to my dad.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.509
If that's the only reason--
because of Nisha--

19:25.543 --> 19:27.878
I think maybe it's time
to just try and make peace.

19:27.912 --> 19:29.780
Again?
Please.

19:29.814 --> 19:31.648
CHAR: You have to do
it, Sutton,

19:31.683 --> 19:33.817
for us, for me.

19:33.852 --> 19:35.652
I've already started on
the acceptance speech.

19:35.687 --> 19:37.788
MADS: See, we've done
all the leg work.

19:37.822 --> 19:40.758
Now all you have to
do is just radiate.

19:55.210 --> 19:58.011
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

19:58.692 --> 20:01.660
So I wanted to talk
to you guys about something.

20:03.797 --> 20:05.798
It's about Laurel.

20:05.832 --> 20:08.634
I was kind of hoping
you would reconsider

20:08.668 --> 20:10.569
letting her go
to Homecoming.

20:10.604 --> 20:12.638
Did your sister put you
up to this?

20:12.672 --> 20:15.441
No, no. She has
no idea I'm out here.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.675
KRISTIN: I just don't
understand.

20:16.710 --> 20:20.813
She stole your things,
blamed your boyfriend.

20:20.847 --> 20:23.749
I know, and I was really mad,

20:23.784 --> 20:27.486
and she told me why she did it,
and it...

20:27.521 --> 20:31.490
Look, I know in the past,

20:31.525 --> 20:34.827
I haven't been
a great sister to her,

20:34.861 --> 20:38.597
but I just want
the chance to fix it.

20:39.833 --> 20:43.502
Please, for me?

20:44.504 --> 20:46.505
For us?

20:48.608 --> 20:51.510
Everyone take one,
pass them around.

20:51.545 --> 20:53.813
Vote for Sutton.

20:53.847 --> 20:56.482
You've obviously got the jocks
and cheerleaders on your side,

20:56.516 --> 20:57.683
but we need to
build your base.

20:57.717 --> 20:59.618
Now, today's sche--
vote Sutton.

20:59.653 --> 21:00.753
Whatever you
say, Char.

21:00.787 --> 21:02.455
Who's that?

21:02.489 --> 21:05.324
Couple classes together,
definitely fringe.

21:05.358 --> 21:06.792
Another group we
need to work on.

21:06.827 --> 21:08.627
So your schedule
for today:

21:08.662 --> 21:10.663
12:00-- lunch with
the yearbook staff,

21:10.697 --> 21:13.432
2:00 p.m.-- hand out cupcakes
to the marching band.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.534
Cupcakes, really?

21:15.569 --> 21:17.636
Um, Nisha's got
a big lead.

21:17.671 --> 21:20.739
If we want to beat her,
we have to dig deep.

21:20.774 --> 21:22.508
Don't be late
to the lunch.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.511
Okay.

21:27.814 --> 21:29.782
So much for sister solidarity.

21:29.816 --> 21:32.133
Sutton Mercer,
back in the race.

21:32.134 --> 21:33.013
Laurel...

21:33.038 --> 21:34.520
Just when I thought
there was actual

21:34.521 --> 21:36.755
hope for us.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.390
Laurel, stop.

21:38.425 --> 21:41.527
You can go to the dance.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.795
What?

21:44.531 --> 21:45.598
Since when?

21:45.632 --> 21:47.533
Since I worked

21:47.567 --> 21:48.834
my magic with
Mom and Dad.

21:48.869 --> 21:50.836
I mean, technically,
you're still grounded,

21:50.871 --> 21:52.471
but they said they'd spring you

21:52.506 --> 21:53.606
for the night.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.542
Now...

21:56.576 --> 21:59.645
go tell your candidate
the good news.

21:59.679 --> 22:01.347
(grunts happily)

22:01.381 --> 22:03.382
(both laugh)

22:04.384 --> 22:05.518
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:05.552 --> 22:07.720
Um, I can go
to the dance.

22:07.754 --> 22:09.421
JUSTIN:
To-to the dance?

22:09.456 --> 22:11.357
(phone ringing) Mm-hmm.
All right.

22:11.391 --> 22:12.691
What's with
the text?

22:12.726 --> 22:15.361
So, I guess this means
you're running.

22:15.395 --> 22:16.662
Got to say,

22:16.696 --> 22:18.664
I'm surprised
Sutton's cool with it.

22:18.698 --> 22:21.500
I keep trying to reach her,
but I can't get through.

22:21.535 --> 22:23.802
You know, this campaign
has taken on a life of its own.

22:23.837 --> 22:25.504
Char has me booked back-to-back,

22:25.539 --> 22:27.373
schmoozing
voters and,

22:27.407 --> 22:30.376
you know, to be honest,
I'm not really a people person,

22:30.410 --> 22:31.777
not like Sutton.

22:31.811 --> 22:33.512
Just be yourself.

22:33.547 --> 22:34.713
I can't be me and her

22:34.748 --> 22:36.615
at the same time.

22:36.650 --> 22:40.486
I'm playing this part,
and it has its perks.

22:42.556 --> 22:46.559
But... okay, listen,

22:46.593 --> 22:49.361
I know

22:49.396 --> 22:51.397
that you're not
into high school functions,

22:51.431 --> 22:53.465
but it's gonna be
a really crazy night,

22:53.500 --> 22:55.801
and it would be really great
if I had my boy...

22:55.835 --> 22:57.703
my one

22:57.737 --> 23:00.506
real friend there.

23:00.540 --> 23:04.710
Sutton has made it pretty clear
she doesn't want people

23:04.744 --> 23:06.712
to see us together.

23:06.746 --> 23:09.782
I'm her secret boyfriend,
remember?

23:09.816 --> 23:13.752
Well, we don't have
to go... <i>together,</i> together.

23:13.787 --> 23:15.688
I mean, we can...

23:15.722 --> 23:19.525
You can stay on the other side
of the room if you wanted to.

23:19.559 --> 23:21.660
I... Just knowing
that you're there and

23:21.695 --> 23:25.731
close-- I think it would
help me pull it off.

23:25.765 --> 23:29.435
Please?

23:30.570 --> 23:32.571
I can't.

23:34.808 --> 23:37.743
I can't.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.451
KRISTIN:
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

23:46.553 --> 23:49.421
Okay, open.

23:49.456 --> 23:50.823
I thought it might come in handy

23:50.857 --> 23:52.725
while you're getting ready
for the dance.

23:52.759 --> 23:55.461
You can try it
with different hairstyles,

23:55.495 --> 23:56.729
see which one looks best,

23:56.763 --> 23:58.831
and you've always had
such beautiful hair.

23:58.865 --> 24:01.400
I-I think... I think
you should wear it down.

24:01.434 --> 24:02.601
- Mom?
- Or up.

24:02.636 --> 24:04.503
Up is fantastic.

24:04.537 --> 24:06.472
(laughs quietly)

24:06.506 --> 24:10.643
I know you're really happy
that I'm running for queen.

24:10.677 --> 24:12.678
What if I lose?

24:12.712 --> 24:15.748
I just...
I don't want to let you down.

24:15.782 --> 24:18.484
It's not possible.

24:27.594 --> 24:30.496
I got to go get
dinner ready.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.498
Okay.

24:32.532 --> 24:34.733
(computer chirping)

24:40.473 --> 24:42.608
Hey. Oh, I am so
glad you called.

24:42.642 --> 24:45.411
So, I have this theory

24:45.445 --> 24:47.713
that Annie Hobbs was an artist,
and I figured it out when...

24:47.747 --> 24:49.782
Excuse me.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.784
Is that my my mom's tiara?

24:55.388 --> 24:56.588
Homecoming is coming up.

24:56.623 --> 24:58.590
And, what, you're running?

24:58.625 --> 25:01.560
I've been trying to tell you,
but I just couldn't reach you.

25:01.594 --> 25:04.463
Well, the power's been down.

25:04.497 --> 25:06.498
I wanted to pull out
of the race,

25:06.533 --> 25:08.667
but people were starting
to get suspicious.

25:08.702 --> 25:11.603
It's really honestly the only
reason why I am doing this,

25:11.638 --> 25:13.405
because I have to.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.507
Well, you can say no, okay?

25:15.542 --> 25:17.309
I tried.

25:17.344 --> 25:19.278
You don't understand
what it's been like...

25:19.312 --> 25:20.446
I know what
it's been like.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.647
Just don't try

25:21.681 --> 25:23.349
and pretend like...

25:23.383 --> 25:27.353
like... you don't
really want this.

25:27.387 --> 25:29.421
I've never thought
that I would be able

25:29.456 --> 25:32.658
to run for something like this
and actually have a shot.

25:32.692 --> 25:36.729
And to have parents
and a family--

25:36.763 --> 25:40.499
it's truly a gift.

25:40.533 --> 25:42.568
More like a hand-me-down...
from me.

25:42.602 --> 25:45.537
Look, I know
that this is your life...

25:45.572 --> 25:47.373
Yes, it is.

25:47.407 --> 25:50.676
And just remember,
it's not you they care about.

25:50.710 --> 25:51.744
Sutton...

25:51.778 --> 25:53.412
Have fun at the dance.

25:56.857 --> 25:58.724
SUTTON: I'm working my butt off
here in L.A.,

25:58.762 --> 26:01.190
and Emma is-is totally
out of control.

26:01.412 --> 26:03.179
She's messing up my plan.

26:03.214 --> 26:06.082
She is stealing my life,
one yearbook page at a time.

26:06.117 --> 26:07.517
She's really trying.

26:07.551 --> 26:09.419
Of course. No, you're right.

26:09.453 --> 26:12.188
I-I'm... I'm sorry. I...

26:13.557 --> 26:16.493
I'm just...
I'm really missing you.

26:16.527 --> 26:20.230
I would give anything
to be on the back of your bike,

26:20.264 --> 26:23.133
wrapping my arms around you.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.501
And what about Homecoming?

26:24.535 --> 26:28.204
We'd meet up after,
go for a ride.

26:28.239 --> 26:29.439
Or I could come with you.

26:29.473 --> 26:31.174
Please. You wouldn't
be caught dead

26:31.208 --> 26:32.208
at a high school dance.

26:32.243 --> 26:33.443
Maybe I'd be willing

26:33.477 --> 26:35.111
to make an exception.

26:35.146 --> 26:37.347
Well, I'm stuck in L.A.

26:37.381 --> 26:40.183
So, don't have to worry
about that.

26:40.217 --> 26:43.253
But if you were here...

26:46.257 --> 26:50.059
You still don't want anyone
to know about us?

26:50.094 --> 26:53.396
I thought we felt the same way
about this.

26:53.430 --> 26:56.299
You were never planning
on taking us public.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.368
I mean, that's the reality here.

26:58.402 --> 27:01.137
- Ethan...
- No. Stop, all right?

27:01.172 --> 27:03.072
Forget it.

27:07.111 --> 27:09.312
It's all real clear.

27:12.149 --> 27:15.318
(dance music playing,
loud chatter and laughter)

27:35.406 --> 27:37.106
Thanks.

27:37.141 --> 27:38.441
No matter who
you voted for,

27:38.475 --> 27:40.543
Sutton says it's just
important that you voted.

27:44.315 --> 27:46.216
X goes to Sutton Mercer.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.483
What does that get me?

27:47.518 --> 27:50.186
A cupcake... but
not much else.

27:50.221 --> 27:52.055
(laughs)

27:52.089 --> 27:54.190
See you, Derek.

28:01.498 --> 28:03.233
EMMA:
Hey! Hi.

28:03.267 --> 28:05.068
Hey, great game!

28:06.370 --> 28:08.277
Oh, my God, thank
God you're here.

28:08.302 --> 28:09.372
Hi.

28:09.373 --> 28:12.075
We thought the queen might be
late for her own coronation.

28:12.109 --> 28:14.043
I feel like I'm on display.

28:14.078 --> 28:15.345
In this game,
that's a good thing.

28:15.379 --> 28:17.146
According
to the latest exit polls,

28:17.181 --> 28:19.315
I'm up by 40 votes.

28:19.350 --> 28:21.384
Oh, well, did you stuff
the ballot box yourself,

28:21.418 --> 28:24.053
or did you have your friends
do it for you?

28:24.088 --> 28:26.055
Game's over, Sutton.

28:26.090 --> 28:29.325
The only thing you're going
<i>repeat</i> is remedial French...

28:29.360 --> 28:32.195
in summer school.

28:32.229 --> 28:34.097
I can't wait to see her face
when Sutton wins.

28:34.131 --> 28:35.298
- It's going to be epic.
- Mm-hmm.

28:35.332 --> 28:39.102
Mads, what's your dad
doing here?

28:39.136 --> 28:41.404
Chaperone. He lives
for this stuff.

28:41.438 --> 28:44.374
Gets to work the floor,
relive his glory days.

28:44.408 --> 28:46.342
CHAR: Hit on the
single moms.

28:46.377 --> 28:49.412
What? It's true.
He knows my mom's

28:49.446 --> 28:52.181
still married to
my dad, right?

28:55.386 --> 28:58.354
I was tidying up
Sutton's room, and

28:58.389 --> 29:01.324
found something... strange.

29:03.934 --> 29:06.210
Did you know she
could draw, like this?

29:07.780 --> 29:09.046
I had no idea.

29:10.434 --> 29:12.168
Some of these are pretty good.

29:12.202 --> 29:14.003
Maybe we should
encourage her,

29:14.038 --> 29:16.339
see if she wants to take a
class at the college, or...

29:16.373 --> 29:19.042
Yeah. It's a good idea.

29:19.076 --> 29:20.410
I was thinking...

29:20.444 --> 29:22.312
Do you think
one of her biological parents

29:22.346 --> 29:24.414
could have been an artist,
and maybe if we contacted

29:24.448 --> 29:26.182
the adoption agency
and just asked...?

29:26.216 --> 29:28.451
So they can tell us what
they told us 17 years ago--

29:28.485 --> 29:30.420
Sutton's mother was
a troubled young woman,

29:30.454 --> 29:32.455
she didn't even know
who got her pregnant?

29:32.489 --> 29:35.191
Maybe. I'm...

29:35.225 --> 29:38.328
I'm just starting to
think we made a mistake,

29:38.362 --> 29:41.464
telling her she died.

29:41.498 --> 29:44.300
I mean, if I was adopted,

29:44.335 --> 29:46.202
I'd be curious
about my birth mother.

29:46.236 --> 29:47.470
I'd probably want
to meet her.

29:47.504 --> 29:49.472
- It's only natural.
- The woman had severe

29:49.506 --> 29:51.374
emotional problems
and a history of drug abuse.

29:51.408 --> 29:53.476
For all we know,
she probably is dead.

29:53.510 --> 29:56.312
Okay, and even if she's not,
call me overprotective,

29:56.347 --> 29:59.082
but I don't want
to see Sutton get hurt.

30:01.118 --> 30:03.086
I suppose you're right.

30:05.255 --> 30:08.358

ALEC:
Sutton?

30:13.530 --> 30:15.498
Hey.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.333
If this is about Mads,

30:17.368 --> 30:19.469
I kind of just want
to stay out of it.

30:19.503 --> 30:21.204
No. I just wanted to
wish you luck tonight.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.473
Oh. Thank you.

30:23.507 --> 30:25.308
You've had your eye
on this tiara

30:25.342 --> 30:27.243
since you were, what, five?

30:27.277 --> 30:29.345
(laughs)
It's got to be incredible, you know,

30:29.380 --> 30:32.315
being so close to getting
everything you wanted.

30:32.349 --> 30:34.117
I guess.

30:34.151 --> 30:36.252
You always
were that

30:36.286 --> 30:40.156
girl who'd stop at nothing,
take no prisoners.

30:40.190 --> 30:43.359
I have to check my makeup.

30:43.394 --> 30:45.595
Hey, Sutton?

30:48.432 --> 30:50.333
Have fun tonight.

30:50.367 --> 30:51.534
(wry chuckle)

30:51.568 --> 30:55.138
And if you win, keep
your ego in check.

Everyone, may I have

- Where were you?

31:05.349 --> 31:07.083
...time that we've all
been waiting for.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.451
The moment of truth.

31:08.485 --> 31:11.320
It's time to announce
Arroyo High School's 2011

31:11.355 --> 31:13.389
Homecoming Court.

31:13.424 --> 31:16.159
Well, well. (laughs)

a star on the tennis court

and a champion

The winner is

31:29.573 --> 31:31.507
Miss Sutton Mercer.

31:31.542 --> 31:34.343
(applause and cheering)

31:34.378 --> 31:36.145
CHAR:
We did it!

31:36.180 --> 31:37.146
MADS:
What are you waiting for?

31:37.181 --> 31:38.514
Go on. Go greet
yo people.

31:38.549 --> 31:41.117
Oh, wait! Your speech.

31:45.456 --> 31:48.458
(cheering swells)

32:04.441 --> 32:08.211
(clears throat)

32:08.245 --> 32:12.115
Fellow classmates,
esteemed teachers...

32:13.350 --> 32:16.419
Uh...

32:19.456 --> 32:23.025
You don't know how much
this means to me.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.329
I especially want
to thank my two best friends--

32:26.363 --> 32:30.199
Char Chamberlin and Mads Rybak--
for believing in me.

32:30.234 --> 32:32.201
I have always

32:32.236 --> 32:35.104
dreamed of something like this,

32:35.139 --> 32:37.507
and just never thought
it was possible, so...

32:37.541 --> 32:40.443
here I am... I guess.

32:40.477 --> 32:42.378
(applause and cheering)

32:42.412 --> 32:44.380
You don't realize
you want something

32:44.414 --> 32:48.317
until you let yourself
want it, so...

32:48.352 --> 32:50.486
Thank you.

32:50.521 --> 32:52.455
(applause and cheering)

32:52.489 --> 32:55.424
Well said.
Congratulations, Sutton.

32:57.094 --> 33:02.165
And... the new
Homecoming King is...

33:02.199 --> 33:06.969
indeed, a newcomer--
Mr. Justin Miller.

33:07.004 --> 33:08.304
Oh, my... oh, my God,
you actually won!

33:08.338 --> 33:09.372
This is just insane!

33:09.406 --> 33:12.074
Go! And just
be handsome.

33:12.109 --> 33:15.011
(people clapping, whooping)

33:15.045 --> 33:17.313
(whooping continues)

33:22.352 --> 33:24.420
Got to say, I admire you
for keeping a brave face.

33:24.454 --> 33:27.190
And I am surprised
to see you out and about

33:27.224 --> 33:28.991
after certain
recent revelations.

33:29.026 --> 33:31.227
I thought the D.A.
would have you on lockdown.

33:31.261 --> 33:33.129
Well, whatever
you said to my dad,

33:33.163 --> 33:35.031
he didn't buy it for one second.

33:35.065 --> 33:36.199
Could've fooled me.

33:37.367 --> 33:38.434
Thank you.

33:38.468 --> 33:42.071
(people whooping)

33:43.140 --> 33:44.473
And now

33:44.508 --> 33:47.376
it's time for our
King and Queen's first dance.

33:47.411 --> 33:50.213

I don't care who knows.

35:03.053 --> 35:06.122
This isn't
about Sutton.

35:06.156 --> 35:08.357
I came here for you.

35:12.296 --> 35:16.132
I never would've pegged
you for the tuxedo type.

35:56.364 --> 35:57.461
Hey, where did you go?

35:57.462 --> 36:00.431
We have some celebrating to do.

36:01.251 --> 36:02.247
Everything okay?

36:02.248 --> 36:05.183
Yeah. It's just...

36:05.218 --> 36:07.018
Nothing.

No, no, wait,
wait, what is it?

36:09.088 --> 36:11.056
It's just...

36:11.090 --> 36:13.892
(sighs)
last year I'm Laurel Mercer,

36:13.926 --> 36:15.227
like, A.P. Dork,

36:15.261 --> 36:17.028
and now I have

36:17.063 --> 36:20.065
this amazing boyfriend, and...

36:20.099 --> 36:22.968
thanks to my
newly awesome sister,

36:23.002 --> 36:25.003
I get to see his...

36:25.037 --> 36:27.138
coronation.

36:28.207 --> 36:30.175
It's nice when
things work out.

36:30.209 --> 36:32.177
And you deserve...

36:32.211 --> 36:34.112
all of it.

36:34.146 --> 36:38.049
Then why do I feel like
it's all going to end somehow?

36:38.084 --> 36:40.952
Well, if it makes it any better,

36:40.987 --> 36:44.055
amazing boyfriend
isn't going anywhere.

36:46.225 --> 36:48.226
(chuckles) You're
the best thing

36:48.261 --> 36:50.195
that's happened to me
since I got here.

36:50.229 --> 36:53.064
I'm not gonna let you go.

37:02.208 --> 37:04.209
Derek.

37:07.213 --> 37:08.980
Got another job for you.

37:09.015 --> 37:11.950
Oh, man.
I thought we were done.

37:11.984 --> 37:15.186
(phone beeps)
You're gonna like this one.

37:23.262 --> 37:25.930
Yo, so what's the job?

37:25.965 --> 37:29.034
I can't believe Sutton is slumming
it with Ethan Whitehorse.

37:29.068 --> 37:30.861
Did you have any idea
she was even seeing him?

37:30.886 --> 37:31.970
No.

37:31.971 --> 37:34.205
And after I confided
in her about Eduardo.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.240
Eventually.

37:35.274 --> 37:38.009
Hey, why aren't
you guys dancing?

37:41.013 --> 37:43.048
Not really feeling it.

37:43.082 --> 37:46.151
I'm gonna go get us
something to drink.

37:46.185 --> 37:48.253
I'll see you
in a minute.

37:51.157 --> 37:52.924
CHAR:
Okay, this isn't

37:52.958 --> 37:54.893
really happening, right?

37:54.927 --> 37:56.895
Okay, Char, I...

37:56.929 --> 37:59.164
know that you're not crazy
about Ethan, but...

37:59.198 --> 38:01.066
he's a really great guy.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.868
To sneak around with, maybe,
but to actually date?

38:03.903 --> 38:06.071
How long has this
been going on?

38:08.074 --> 38:11.009
Almost... a year now.

38:11.043 --> 38:14.112
And you never thought
to tell your best friends?

38:14.146 --> 38:16.147
What is with
all the secrets

38:16.182 --> 38:18.149
around here?
Maddy.

38:19.218 --> 38:21.219
Can I talk to you
for a second?

38:24.256 --> 38:27.092
Yeah?

38:28.294 --> 38:30.962
ALEC:
What is this?

38:30.996 --> 38:32.197
I thought you said

38:32.231 --> 38:33.998
there wasn't
anything between

38:34.033 --> 38:35.200
you and Eduardo.

38:35.234 --> 38:38.036
I... told you,
there's nothing going on, Dad.

38:38.070 --> 38:41.106
That was... we were in the
middle of rehearsing a scene

38:41.140 --> 38:43.007
for the recital...
Maddy, I've got

38:43.042 --> 38:46.144
a pretty good ear for lies;
you want to try again?

38:47.313 --> 38:50.882
All right,
it wasn't a rehearsal.

38:52.952 --> 38:56.020
I kind of threw myself at him.

38:57.890 --> 39:00.091
But he didn't want anything
to do with me, so...

39:00.126 --> 39:03.228
Was he there when I got
home the other morning?

39:03.262 --> 39:06.131
Was he in the house?

39:06.165 --> 39:08.233
Yes, but it's not what
you're thinking. He...

39:08.267 --> 39:10.969
Wait, Dad, where
are you going?

39:11.003 --> 39:15.039
Don't ask questions you
already know the answer to.

39:20.212 --> 39:22.113
(crickets chirping)

39:33.159 --> 39:35.927
You keep doing that,
you'll break it.

39:35.961 --> 39:37.262
- Where are you going?
- Out.

39:40.933 --> 39:42.233
(picks up keys)

39:42.268 --> 39:44.102
What if you stayed?

39:44.136 --> 39:46.070
Why should I?

39:53.112 --> 39:54.879
Whoa, hold on, hold on.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.215
Are you sure
about this?

39:57.249 --> 40:00.952
Okay. Never mind,
forget I said that.

40:15.901 --> 40:17.168
(chuckles softly)

40:34.119 --> 40:38.056
(upbeat music playing)

40:44.263 --> 40:46.097
Mr. Rybak.

40:46.131 --> 40:48.199
You expecting someone else?

40:48.234 --> 40:51.169
Listen... I never
laid a hand on Mads.

40:51.203 --> 40:53.171
I know, I know.
You're not stupid.

40:53.205 --> 40:55.206
Actually, that's
not why I'm here.

40:55.241 --> 40:57.842
(knocking)
I don't understand.

40:57.877 --> 40:59.143
Let me get it.

41:01.113 --> 41:02.847
(door opens)

41:02.882 --> 41:06.150
- Maddy, why don't you go home.
- No, Dad.

41:06.185 --> 41:08.887

I've got this.
