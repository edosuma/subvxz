This is where we shall part ways.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.575

00:39.582 --> 00:41.618
You might want to rethink this.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.830
We had a deal. Get out of my way.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.211
Believe it or not, I'm doing you a favor.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.458
By preventing my vengeance?

00:48.633 --> 00:50.919
Ask yourself how I'm doing that.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.386
By using your dark magic.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.588
Exactly.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.422
Magic is here.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.141
And that makes matters
a bit more complicated.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.554
If you go off half-cocked after
an empowered Rumplestiltskin,

01:04.649 --> 01:05.684

01:07.652 --> 01:09.358
So, you do. Good.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.537
No, thank you, we're fine.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.198
It's a fine vessel you got there,
when'd you get in?

01:24.377 --> 01:25.662
What vessel?

01:26.963 --> 01:28.123
Why, that one, right...

01:32.176 --> 01:33.837

01:49.986 --> 01:53.023

we need the element of surprise.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.320

02:27.023 --> 02:28.388
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.

Taco shells were on sale!

not a big item in the enchanted...

It's the middle of the afternoon.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.615
The trip back was tiring,
and I needed to rest.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.289
And I needed to help her rest.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.913
Uh... Let's go make the tacos.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.335
We have to make a lot.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.791

you were gonna be back later.

03:00.473 --> 03:01.462
Yeah, well, we weren't.

So, maybe next time you can put
a tie on the door or send a text or...

03:13.944 --> 03:15.559

we can still provide her

11:25.185 --> 11:27.767

we used to capture her

of doing something so vile.

What's there to talk about? She killed
Archie. Now, she's gotta pay.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.285
And how do you plan on doing that?
She has her powers back here.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.913
Yeah, well, you just saw
what happened. So do |.

29:56.003 --> 29:58.210
Yeah, you have something,

29:58.297 --> 29:59.958
but you didn't even know
what the hell to do with it

30:00.049 --> 30:02.290
and now you're gonna go take on
the most powerful woman in town?

30:02.385 --> 30:03.500
Excuse me, aren't you both the ones

30:03.594 --> 30:06.006
who've been pushing on the
"it's Regina" kick the whole time?

30:06.097 --> 30:07.428
You should be happy you were right.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.636
We may be right, but I also know that

30:08.724 --> 30:10.225
going after her without a plan
is a mistake.

30:10.393 --> 30:11.473
So what do we do?

30:11.602 --> 30:13.467
Even if the dwarfs
construct a cell to hold her,

30:13.604 --> 30:15.811
we need a way
to contain her magic until then.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.645
Fairy dust. Leroy said they were
processing a new batch of it.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.066
Will that stop her power?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.940
It has before.
Problem is she'll see us coming.

30:24.740 --> 30:28.153
Leave that to me.
Trust me, we're locking her up.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.419
Your highness.

30:44.844 --> 30:45.924
Leave us, please.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.839
But I have direct orders
from the Prince...

30:47.972 --> 30:50.258
And now you have direct orders
from me.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.270
QUEEN: First you stop my execution

31:02.361 --> 31:05.945
and then you defy your prince
to see me?

31:08.951 --> 31:11.283
Should I be worried
there's trouble in paradise?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.743
I'm not here to talk about my fiance.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.287
Then why are you here?

31:18.461 --> 31:21.123
I know you weren't always
like this, Regina.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.464
The woman who saved my life
all those years ago

31:26.385 --> 31:27.886
had good in her.

31:28.012 --> 31:29.968
That woman lost much.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.301
And now she's gone.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.516
Maybe.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.804
But as hard as you've tried to bury her,

31:40.941 --> 31:43.273
I think she's still inside you.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.226
No, she's not.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.452
All you need

32:01.337 --> 32:02.326
(DOOR SQUEAKS)

32:04.006 --> 32:05.871
is someone to help you let her out.

32:06.467 --> 32:07.502
What are you doing?

32:08.010 --> 32:10.547
l'm letting the woman
who saved my life go.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.013
This is a chance to start fresh, Regina.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.180
To leave the evil behind, in this cell.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.024
Just like that?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.661
Just like that.

Did you really think
this would protect you?

32:54.557 --> 32:56.843
Since I can't use magic,

32:57.852 --> 32:59.888
I can think of no better way

33:00.604 --> 33:04.096
than to kill you with the blade
you had meant for me.

33:06.402 --> 33:08.063
Goodbye, Snow White.

33:08.279 --> 33:09.394
No.

Yes.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.535

That's impossible.

No. That's magic.

And this time, it wasn't thanks to fairies.

33:37.099 --> 33:38.600
Rumplestiltskin.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.635
He took one of your hairs from this
and used it to fashion a protection spell.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.140
No!

33:44.273 --> 33:47.390
Now, there's nothing you can do
in this land to hurt Snow or me.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.769
You're powerless against us.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.276
You tricked me.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.821
It wasn't a trick. It was a test.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.821
One that I had truly hoped you'd pass.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.911
PRINCE CHARMING: We wanted to
give you a chance to change, Regina.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.993
Regina, you're banished.

34:04.168 --> 34:06.659
Banished to live alone with your misery.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.501
As long as you're alive in this world,

34:09.632 --> 34:11.293
you can't hurt us.

34:18.307 --> 34:20.172
You saved my life once,

34:21.936 --> 34:23.517
and now I've saved yours.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.512
So we're even.

34:28.317 --> 34:32.151
And if you ever try to hurt anyone
in my kingdom again, lwill kill you.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.830
Ms. Swan.
I assume you're here to apologize.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.289
I saw you do it.

34:50.381 --> 34:51.370
What?

34:51.632 --> 34:54.840
I saw it.
You choked the life out of Archie.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.051
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

34:57.221 --> 34:58.631
Magic.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.262
You...

35:01.350 --> 35:03.511
I saw what happened, and it was you.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.804
Gold. He helped you.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.102
You're going to trust him, of all people,

35:11.193 --> 35:12.854
when he's probably the one
behind this?

35:12.987 --> 35:14.523
We didn't trust him.

35:15.197 --> 35:18.360
That's why Emma used magic instead.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.659
You can use magic.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.330
The savior. Of course.

35:28.252 --> 35:30.083
Well, I can only assume
he warned you, then.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.247
About what?

35:31.505 --> 35:33.917
That magic always comes with a price.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.047
Yeah, well that's a price
we're both gonna pay.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.256
How's that?

35:37.386 --> 35:39.752
Henry. He believed in you.

His heart's gonna break.

That's both our prices.

No.

lwill not let you poison Henry
against me!

Since you already did.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.565
He deserves to hear my side
of the story! He's my son!

He's not! He's mine!

35:59.074 --> 36:01.781

36:28.645 --> 36:31.432
Maybe some of your newfound magic
can save you now.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.897
I don't need it. I already won.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.771
There's no way Henry will swallow
your lies about Archie now.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.613
You can pretend all you want,
but we know how you are.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.400
And who you will always be.

Henry's bus is going to be here
any minute.

37:07.476 --> 37:08.841
You can do this.

Tell my son that someone he loved

37:10.437 --> 37:11.893
was killed by someone else
he cares about?

37:11.980 --> 37:13.015
I don't know if I can.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.059
Okay, I don't think I can do any of this.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.435
This is, like, real parent stuff.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.483
How can I be a parent
if I never was one?

37:18.612 --> 37:21.604
I know. I've been asking myself
the same question.

37:21.698 --> 37:25.156
Oh, no. You guys don't have to...
It's different.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.822
No, it isn't. And, yes, we have to.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.154
We can figure it out. So can you.

37:30.290 --> 37:33.123
You don't know me. You don't know
what I was before Storybrooke.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.451
And trust me, l was not parent material.

37:35.546 --> 37:37.582
Yeah, but we know who you are
since you've been here.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.004
What if! revert? Regina did.

37:39.133 --> 37:41.966
You're not going to. And the Emma
I know was great with Henry.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.008
l was his parent for five minutes.

37:44.138 --> 37:45.344
And I was yours for five minutes, too.

37:45.472 --> 37:48.179
But things are different now,
for all of us.

37:49.518 --> 37:53.887

any of it alone. We're family.

and lwant you to hear it from me first.

38:21.884 --> 38:22.873

What other friends
do you have, dearie?

to help raise your spirits.

42:00.769 --> 42:03.181
You disguised the body
to look like him?
