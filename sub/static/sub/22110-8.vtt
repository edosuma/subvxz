Hey, Meg. What are you up to?

00:37.921 --> 00:39.923
Not much. Just finished
an angel food cake.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.193
Might go out to the trash, see
if there's any possums to kiss.

00:43.227 --> 00:44.994
I was just out there.

00:46.930 --> 00:48.365
Oh, come on,
it's your senior year.

00:48.398 --> 00:50.434
Somebody must be having a party
or something.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.735
Well, there's one.

00:51.768 --> 00:53.737
But... I wasn't invited.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.071
Well, so what? Go crash it.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.606
Nah. Not my style.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.210
And what do you care?
Do you want the TV or something?

01:00.244 --> 01:03.813
What? No, no. I want...
I want to see you have fun.

01:03.847 --> 01:06.750
Come on, you should go,
you know? Let loose a little.

01:06.783 --> 01:08.785
You know what? You're right.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.887
Maybe I will give it a shot.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.088
Yeah. How awkward could it be?

01:12.122 --> 01:13.890
Can't be worse
than waving at someone

01:13.923 --> 01:15.759
who doesn't wave back at you.

01:19.028 --> 01:20.997
-No, not you.
-Oh. Sorry.

01:21.030 --> 01:23.066
In fact, everyone but you.

01:23.099 --> 01:24.734
Hi, everyone but him!

01:24.768 --> 01:26.536
OTHERS:
Hi!

01:29.606 --> 01:32.942
Lou, I like you a lot, but
I-I think that's the last tape

01:32.976 --> 01:35.679
of you having sex with
your girlfriend I want to see.

01:35.712 --> 01:36.946
Suit yourself.

01:36.980 --> 01:39.483
All right, I got to get over
to my mom's wake.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.817
Oh, right, yeah. Crap.

01:40.850 --> 01:41.951
Ugh. Sorry again.

01:41.985 --> 01:43.920
-Oof. Cancer.
-Car accident.

01:43.953 --> 01:45.755
No, I know, I just, I'm...

01:45.789 --> 01:47.991
saying it feels like
everyone's getting cancer.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.859
You know, Bowie.

01:52.829 --> 01:54.964

01:54.998 --> 01:58.134
Time to get creepay...

02:00.504 --> 02:02.572
BRIAN:
Huh. Kid family.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.984
BRIAN:
What a scumbag.

02:15.819 --> 02:18.888
(baby bawling)

02:18.922 --> 02:19.956
Aw...

02:19.989 --> 02:21.691
(muffled arguing)

02:21.725 --> 02:23.627
(muffled):
Because I'm working all day!

02:23.660 --> 02:26.830
Oh, yeah? Well, here's what
I think of your stupid work!

02:26.863 --> 02:28.298
Don't you do that!

02:28.332 --> 02:30.066
Fiona, don't you...

02:32.436 --> 02:34.137
Is that Principal Shepherd?

02:34.170 --> 02:37.040
Wow, that looks like
a rocky relationship.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.075
"Rocky relationship."

02:41.211 --> 02:42.779
Ha-ha!

02:45.749 --> 02:47.917
Oh, come on, Brian.

02:47.951 --> 02:49.253
Don't comment or like it.

02:49.286 --> 02:52.055
It's a hard lesson,
but one he has to learn.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.558
(electronic dance music playing)

02:56.960 --> 02:58.328
(music stops)

02:58.362 --> 02:59.629
(crickets chirping)

03:01.965 --> 03:04.268
(electronic dance music resumes)

03:04.301 --> 03:08.171
All right, ladies,
time to mingle.

03:08.204 --> 03:11.007
Hey. You guys
talking Big Bang over here?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.409
Big Bang Theory?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.744
No? Any Bangers over here?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.112
No?

03:16.145 --> 03:17.681
Well, I've tried everything.

03:17.714 --> 03:20.183
We just don't have anything
in common with these guys.

03:20.216 --> 03:24.621
Maybe... we don't need
anything in common with them.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.591
(grunts)

03:27.624 --> 03:29.859
Meg, come on, don't go crazy.

03:29.893 --> 03:31.561
Damn, that's hot!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.064
That was just lucky.

03:35.098 --> 03:36.766
Oh, yeah?

03:40.504 --> 03:43.239
Wow! Meg's so good
at casually tossing bottles

03:43.273 --> 03:45.275
over her shoulder
so they land upright!

03:45.309 --> 03:46.943
And that's very popular
right now,

03:46.976 --> 03:49.413
because we've
run out of things on Earth.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.748
Meg, that was amazing!

03:51.781 --> 03:53.917
What can I say?
I'm full of surprises.

03:53.950 --> 03:56.486
Like the end

You got a second?

Brian? Hang on.

04:50.807 --> 04:52.442
Hey, keep it down,
you screwballs.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.511
Here, let me just go
somewhere a little quieter.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.180
-(party chatter) -Oh, yeah,
right. I'm the screwball.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.282
You and friends
say "screwball" a lot.

04:59.315 --> 05:01.718
That's what happens when
you run with a screwy crowd.

05:01.751 --> 05:02.786
What's up with you?

05:02.819 --> 05:03.820
Stewie, I think...

05:03.853 --> 05:06.556
I think Principal Shepherd
killed his wife.

05:06.590 --> 05:07.991
What? What are you
talking about?

05:08.024 --> 05:10.159
I think I saw him
getting rid of her body.

05:10.193 --> 05:12.295
And carrying a bag
with something heavy in it.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.864
And... and there was red liquid
dripping from it.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.400
Okay, I've got to see this
for myself.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.034
Don't do anything.
I'm coming over.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.469
Hey, listen,
you-you don't think...

05:19.503 --> 05:21.505
you don't think you
could snag a couple of rolls

05:21.538 --> 05:23.206
of toilet paper, could you?

05:24.608 --> 05:27.143
-Stewie?
-I'm here. I just wanted you

05:27.176 --> 05:29.679
to have to sit with those words
for a minute.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.818
LOIS:
Kids, dinner's ready!

05:34.851 --> 05:35.885
(mocking):
"Dinner's ready."

05:35.919 --> 05:37.186
Shut up.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.256
Little of the old schnappster
ought to get me right.

05:41.357 --> 05:43.527
'Ey... Chrissay!

05:43.560 --> 05:45.995
CHRIS: Well, that's
delightfully informal, Meg.

05:46.029 --> 05:47.897
How the heck are ya?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.869
So, what are you kids
doing in school?

05:52.902 --> 05:55.104
I got in trouble for saying
something "insensitive"

05:55.138 --> 05:56.873
to trans kids.

05:56.906 --> 05:58.608
-What'd you say?
-Well, a few them started

05:58.642 --> 06:01.010
this a cappella group,
and they're all kind of chubby.

06:01.044 --> 06:05.281
So I said, "You guys should
call yourselves the Trans Fats."

06:05.314 --> 06:08.051
(laughs) Meg, you'll sit
next to me this evening.

06:08.084 --> 06:11.187
-But, Dad... -I'm sorry, Chris.
You've fallen out of favor.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.056
Perhaps forever.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.629
Oh, Stewie,
thank God you're here.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.765
There's a seagull
in your hallway.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.932
Listen, what are we gonna do

06:22.966 --> 06:24.534
about this
Principal Shepherd thing?

06:24.568 --> 06:27.737
Look, all you know is that
the guy was carrying a wet bag.

06:27.771 --> 06:29.372
It doesn't mean
he killed his wife.

06:29.405 --> 06:31.407
-You're building this whole
theory... -(electronic ding)

06:31.441 --> 06:32.642
What is that noise?

06:32.676 --> 06:34.110
It's a news alert.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.481
"Fiona Shepherd, wife of James
Woods High School principal

06:37.514 --> 06:40.149
John Shepherd,
has been reported missing."

06:40.183 --> 06:42.151
Oh, my God, maybe he did do it.

06:42.185 --> 06:44.488
You know, there are
some bad people in this world.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.255
Hey, you don't got
to tell me that.

06:46.289 --> 06:48.324
I learned that in Fight Club.

06:48.357 --> 06:50.894
All right, Stewie, what's
the first rule of Fight Club?

06:50.927 --> 06:52.662
G-string underwear.

06:52.696 --> 06:54.898
No. It's "don't talk
about Fight Club."

06:54.931 --> 06:57.433
Oh. Well, I really blew it.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.342
Hey-o! What's up in this piece?

07:06.375 --> 07:08.077
You're getting home late.

07:08.111 --> 07:10.313
Yeah. We were hanging out
in the woods, and...

07:10.346 --> 07:12.015
(laughing)

07:12.048 --> 07:14.951
...this one girl pushed
another girl over

07:14.984 --> 07:16.820
while she was peeing.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.822
They fought,
and then the cops came.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.123
Meg, this is important.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.158
Did she fall in the pee?

07:22.191 --> 07:23.627
I can smell your breath.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.294
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

07:25.328 --> 07:28.832
No! Geez, Mom, get off my back.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.034
Peter, I think
she's doing booze.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.468
What should we do?

07:32.502 --> 07:34.303
Lois, she's just being
a teenager.

07:34.337 --> 07:36.973
We don't know she's, like, for
sure, definitely been drinking.

07:37.006 --> 07:39.142
I found this in her room.

07:39.175 --> 07:40.844
My little girl's a drunk!

07:40.877 --> 07:43.880
(sobbing): Oh, my God,
where did we go wrong?

07:50.153 --> 07:52.455
Meg, we need to talk.

07:52.488 --> 07:54.824
What, Mom? But I know
what you're gonna say,

07:54.858 --> 07:56.693
and I know how
you're gonna say it.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.994
-Oh, really?
-Yep.

07:58.027 --> 07:59.563
(imitates Lois):
I don't want you drinkin'

07:59.596 --> 08:01.665
or your life's
gonna go down the crappah.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.466
(laughs)
That's not bad.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.535
I-I mean,
I sound nothing like that,

08:05.569 --> 08:07.537
but it's a fun character. Heh.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.905
But this is serious.

08:08.938 --> 08:10.907
Alcoholism runs in our family.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.543
Hey, I'm just glad
something runs in this family.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.844
(laughing)

08:14.878 --> 08:16.680
I don't mean to...
(laughs)

08:16.713 --> 08:19.549
I-I don't mean to laugh, okay?
But that was funny.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.150
Mom, I'm just having fun.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.987
I'm finally known as something
other than "the chubby girl

08:24.020 --> 08:25.689
who put the lunch lady
in a headlock."

08:25.722 --> 08:27.757
And besides, Dad's the one

08:27.791 --> 08:29.525
who pushed me
into going to that party.

08:29.559 --> 08:31.761
Oh, he did, did he?

08:32.962 --> 08:34.530
Son of a bitch.
What was that?

08:34.564 --> 08:37.200
I don't know. Someone
must've messed something up.

08:37.233 --> 08:39.402
Listen, you need to talk to Meg
about her drinking.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.704
What? Why me?

08:40.737 --> 08:42.005
Because you're the one
who told her

08:42.038 --> 08:43.907
to start going
to these parties.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.374
(sighs)
Okay, fine.

08:45.408 --> 08:47.577
I guess it's just something
I got to deal with.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.879
Like the flush
of a high-powered toilet.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.725
So, you plan on going back
at that banana, huh?

09:01.758 --> 09:03.059
So the bastard killed his wife,

09:03.092 --> 09:04.794
and then reported her missing.

09:04.828 --> 09:06.930
I-I got to...
I got to call the cops.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.232
(line ringing)

09:09.265 --> 09:11.267
-Quahog Police.
-Joe, Joe, it's Brian.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.869
Listen, I have
to tell you something.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.303
I-I'm pretty sure

09:14.337 --> 09:15.805
Principal Shepherd
killed his wife.

09:15.839 --> 09:18.808
That's a serious accusation.
Do you have any proof?

09:18.842 --> 09:20.877
I have something better
than proof:

09:20.910 --> 09:23.713
rank suspicion born out
of boredom and loneliness.

09:23.747 --> 09:26.249
Sorry, that's just not enough
for us to go on.

09:26.282 --> 09:29.452
You must be pretty tired
from thinking about all this.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.921
-You ever get bags
under your eyes? -What?

09:31.955 --> 09:34.891
I've been using this eye cream,
it's done wonders for me.

09:34.924 --> 09:37.226
It's made by a company
called Rodan and Fields.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.628
Have you heard of them, Brian?

09:38.662 --> 09:39.729
Yeah, I-I think, uh...

09:39.763 --> 09:41.297
Oh, they make terrific stuff.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.899
In fact, I was such a fan,

09:42.932 --> 09:44.834
I became a sales consultant
for the company.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.435
Listen, Joe, I got to run.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.437
I'm hosting a little
get-together tomorrow night,

09:48.471 --> 09:50.674
If you want to stop by.
There's gonna be pizza

09:50.707 --> 09:54.110
and soft drinks, then a man's
gonna talk about the whole line.

09:54.143 --> 09:56.780
Can I go ahead
and confirm your attendance?

09:56.813 --> 09:58.281
-(beeps)
-Well, that was no help.

09:58.314 --> 10:00.316
What if I go over there
and try to find some evidence

10:00.349 --> 10:01.951
-that he did it?
-All right, fine.

10:01.985 --> 10:03.019
But you have to be careful.

10:03.052 --> 10:04.788
Don't worry,
he won't have any idea.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.089
I'll be more discreet

10:06.122 --> 10:08.825
than a guy standing by himself
in the ocean.

10:10.827 --> 10:11.795
Hey, are you peeing?

10:11.828 --> 10:12.962
No.

10:12.996 --> 10:14.197
Are you pooping?

10:14.230 --> 10:16.032
I'm just trying
to enjoy the day.

10:16.065 --> 10:17.834
Why don't you
go bother that guy?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.636
Summer's blown by, huh?

10:23.673 --> 10:25.675
So, your mom says
you've been drinking.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.276
Yeah, like, a little bit, but...

10:27.310 --> 10:28.945
but it's nothing
you have to worry about.

10:28.978 --> 10:30.880
Look, I-I was young,
too, you know.

10:30.914 --> 10:34.283
I-I remember going to parties,
walking up with a six pack.

10:34.317 --> 10:36.953
You're so excited to get there,
you start jogging a little.

10:36.986 --> 10:39.856
Your friends are all there,
and they're so happy to see you,

10:39.889 --> 10:41.490
they're practically cheering
your name.

10:41.524 --> 10:44.327
And then "Mony Mony" comes on
at just the right time.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.829
And everyone's dancing,

10:45.862 --> 10:48.732
and-and Laura Hallston's jugs
are just slamming into you.

10:48.765 --> 10:50.466
You don't have a care
in the world,

10:50.499 --> 10:53.402
and if all of it came to an end
right then and there, so be it.

10:53.436 --> 10:55.138
Well, you're my daughter,

10:55.171 --> 10:57.974
and I don't want
any of that for you.

10:58.007 --> 11:01.344
Hey, you want to see where I was
sitting when you were born?

11:04.881 --> 11:07.150
Yeah, I still think
about Laura a lot.

11:07.183 --> 11:09.385
You were already drinking
tonight, weren't you?

11:09.418 --> 11:10.854
(giggles, snorts)
A little.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.489
Well, I can't talk
to a drunk person if I'm sober.

11:13.522 --> 11:15.825
Hey, Jerome,
can I get a beer, please?

11:15.859 --> 11:18.061
But now I'm starting
to sober up,

11:18.094 --> 11:20.997
so I'm gonna need one
to keep an even playing field.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.032
All right,
but it stays between us.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.567
And what if they card you?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.870
Don't worry. I got it covered.

11:29.072 --> 11:30.840
Wow. That's really good.

11:30.874 --> 11:34.077
Right?! Jerome, make it two!

BRIAN:
All right, he's gone.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.933
Now, if I give the word, you've
got to get out of there, okay?

12:29.966 --> 12:31.801
Got it.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.436
Oh, my God!

12:33.469 --> 12:34.838
BRIAN:
What? What is it?

12:34.871 --> 12:36.405
He sleeps in a bunk bed!

12:36.439 --> 12:38.141
Are you kidding me?!
Who is this guy?!

12:38.174 --> 12:40.143
Wait a second. Is that...?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.011
Bri, I'm gonna put you down
for a sec.

12:42.045 --> 12:44.347
Stewie, no! Don't.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.953
(elevator bell dings)

12:49.986 --> 12:51.420
Stewie, get out of there!

12:51.454 --> 12:53.256
Stewie! Stewie!

12:53.289 --> 12:56.559
Got to get his attention.
(grunts)

12:57.626 --> 12:59.728
Man, just short.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.700
BRIAN:
Oh, God.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.848
-(knocking)
-MAN: Domino's.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.550
Oh, good.

13:21.584 --> 13:22.952
MAN:
Medium pie, ten wings.

13:22.986 --> 13:24.954
BRIAN: Is the blue cheese
dressing in there?

13:24.988 --> 13:26.522
Thanks a lot. Have a good one.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.124
(door closes)

13:28.157 --> 13:30.159
(Brian munching on food)

13:33.762 --> 13:35.764
Mmm.

13:42.105 --> 13:45.574
He got out! Ha, ha!
Yes, Stewie!

13:56.920 --> 13:58.354
Oh, crap.

13:58.387 --> 14:00.056
Oh, my, that was close.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.992
Stewie, he saw you! He saw you
leaving his apartment!

14:03.026 --> 14:05.094
Oh. Well... so what?

14:05.128 --> 14:07.230
He doesn't know
what we're doing.

14:11.034 --> 14:13.036
-(gasps)
-What? What is it?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.072
STEWIE:
Well, that's...

14:16.105 --> 14:17.840
that's not good.

14:17.873 --> 14:20.143
(seagulls squawking)

14:22.311 --> 14:24.280
(water lapping)

14:28.918 --> 14:30.253
Dad? Dad, wake up!

14:30.286 --> 14:31.754
-Huh? What happened?
-I don't know!

14:31.787 --> 14:33.923
We must have stolen this boat
last night.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.959
I-I have no idea
where the hell we are!

14:37.893 --> 14:39.862
Oh, no, my cell phone's dead!

14:39.895 --> 14:41.797
I got a little bit
of juice left,

14:41.830 --> 14:43.799
so we can either
A, call someone,

14:43.832 --> 14:45.601
maybe they answer,
maybe they can help,

14:45.634 --> 14:49.138
or B, we can definitely
switch faces.

14:49.172 --> 14:51.740
Look at you!
Look at me!

14:51.774 --> 14:53.209
-That's what this is!
-(beep)

14:53.242 --> 14:55.644
Oh, we're gonna die.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.552
Dad, what are we gonna do?

15:03.586 --> 15:05.989
You think it's too early to tie
our shirts around our heads

15:06.022 --> 15:07.590
to show we're going insane?

15:07.623 --> 15:09.592
I mean it, Dad. This is serious.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.327
I did pants instead.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.829
Ugh! I don't feel so hot.

15:13.862 --> 15:15.131
What is wrong with me?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.333
Have you taken a break
since you started drinking?

15:17.366 --> 15:18.801
Not until right now.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.270
Do you feel like lying
on the couch, rubbing your eyes,

15:21.304 --> 15:22.905
while listening
to Lou Reed's "Perfect Day"?

15:22.938 --> 15:25.341
-Yes! -Then I'll tell you
what's wrong with you.

15:25.374 --> 15:26.742
You got a hangover.

15:26.775 --> 15:28.344
What can you do for a hangover?

15:28.377 --> 15:30.313
Well, Meg,
so I don't have to think

15:30.346 --> 15:31.647
about my throbbing headache,

15:31.680 --> 15:33.983
I try to think of
something else, like a riddle.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.952
Like, how would you describe
Chris O'Donnell?

15:36.986 --> 15:40.256
Huh. He's not tall or short.

15:40.289 --> 15:42.458
And he's not fat or thin.

15:42.491 --> 15:45.161
Well, he's not handsome or ugly.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.664
And he's not young or old.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.699
He's not loud or quiet.

15:50.733 --> 15:54.003
Uh, he's not memorable,
but-but I know who he is.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.039
(gasps)
Thanks, Dad!

15:56.072 --> 15:57.873
I feel so much better.

15:57.906 --> 15:59.475
But you know who doesn't?

15:59.508 --> 16:01.010
Chris O'Donnell.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.578
Bye, dildo.

16:05.648 --> 16:07.250
(footsteps approaching)

16:09.418 --> 16:11.387
Oh, no. Hard shoes on linoleum.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.955
That's a principal!

16:12.988 --> 16:14.823
Brian, a lot of people
live in this building,

16:14.857 --> 16:17.560
and you can't tell it's
a principal just from a walk.

16:17.593 --> 16:19.395
(slow knocking)

16:19.428 --> 16:22.731
MAN: Excuse me? May I have
your attention, please?

16:22.765 --> 16:24.900
Okay, that's probably
a principal.

16:27.770 --> 16:30.005
Hey. How are you today?

16:30.039 --> 16:31.540
What can I do for you?

16:31.574 --> 16:32.975
What do you want from me?

16:33.008 --> 16:34.910
Listen, it's...
it's-it's not what you think.

16:34.943 --> 16:36.412
Then what is it?

16:36.445 --> 16:39.548
Well... I'm, um...
I'm actually doing a documentary

16:39.582 --> 16:41.016
about some
of the finest principals

16:41.050 --> 16:42.651
in the country, and...

16:42.685 --> 16:44.253
Ow! Continue.

16:44.287 --> 16:47.556
"Finest principals
in the country" and...

16:47.590 --> 16:49.392
Brian!

16:49.425 --> 16:51.727
-Stewie! Help me!
-(wind whistling)

16:51.760 --> 16:53.496
BRIAN:
How did I get here?

16:53.529 --> 16:56.599
Well, to answer that, you'd
have to go back a little while.

16:56.632 --> 16:57.766
STEWIE:
We're not doing that!

16:57.800 --> 16:59.935
(wind whistling, thudding)

17:02.071 --> 17:04.207
We found this in a Dumpster

17:04.240 --> 17:05.841
behind Principal Shepherd's
building.

17:05.874 --> 17:07.710
That's it.
That's-that's the bag!

17:07.743 --> 17:09.445
I guarantee his wife's in there.

17:11.647 --> 17:13.082
(retching)

17:13.116 --> 17:15.284
Ha! What's the matter, rook?
Too heavy for you?

17:15.318 --> 17:17.220
I've actually been a cop
for years.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.887
I have tummy cancer.

17:18.921 --> 17:21.090
Oh. Weird way to say that.

17:22.758 --> 17:24.793
What the hell? Bu-But I saw...

17:24.827 --> 17:26.061
Yeah, well, what is all this?

17:26.095 --> 17:27.363
Principal Shepherd,

17:27.396 --> 17:29.798
I think you've got
some explaining to do.

17:29.832 --> 17:31.934
Look, I tried to tell you,
I didn't kill my wife.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.437
She just texted me today
that she's moved out

17:34.470 --> 17:36.572
and she's banging my cousin,

17:36.605 --> 17:38.641
Pat Sajak's accountant,
by the way.

17:38.674 --> 17:40.309
STEWIE:
It's a weird time to name drop.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.245
And the food, well,
I've been stealing it

17:42.278 --> 17:44.113
from the high school
to make ends meet.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.582
My life's "kinda brute,"
as the kids say.

17:46.615 --> 17:48.317
Sounds like
you've had a rough day.

17:48.351 --> 17:51.654
No wonder you've got those bags
under your eyes.

17:51.687 --> 17:56.058
Have you ever heard of a company
called Rodan and Fields?

17:56.091 --> 17:58.161
(water lapping)

17:58.194 --> 18:01.664
MEG:
Ugh. Are all hangovers this bad?

18:01.697 --> 18:04.733
PETER: Yup, that's the deal
you make with the gods of fun.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.835
Every 72 hours, you lose a day.

18:06.869 --> 18:09.305
Dad, you're so sunburnt.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.740
I can't move
because it hurts too bad.

18:11.774 --> 18:13.342
Ugh. This is awful.

18:13.376 --> 18:15.944
We don't even know
if anyone's looking for us.

18:15.978 --> 18:17.846
Look, don't worry.
We're gonna be okay.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.815
This is why you shouldn't drink.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.084
Booze is nothing but trouble,
and you don't need it.

18:22.117 --> 18:24.119
You got a good brain
in your head.

18:24.153 --> 18:27.490
Thanks, Dad, and if this is what
drinking makes you feel like,

18:27.523 --> 18:29.091
you don't have
to worry about it.

18:29.124 --> 18:31.327
I am done with booze.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.262
Aw, I'm glad to hear that.

18:33.296 --> 18:35.164
And I'm sorry
I pushed it on you.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.500
I just...
I just wanted to watch TV.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.802
I don't want
to see you waste opportunities

18:39.835 --> 18:41.637
'cause you were out partying.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.138
That's what I did.

18:43.172 --> 18:45.140
You just worry about being you.

18:45.174 --> 18:46.642
Don't worry, Dad.

18:46.675 --> 18:48.777
I'll never be anything like you.

18:48.811 --> 18:50.713
That's my girl.

18:51.747 --> 18:54.250
-(helicopter blades whirring)
-Dad, look!

18:56.051 --> 18:58.654
Oh, my God.
Meg, we're saved!

19:03.892 --> 19:05.961
Thank God you found us.

19:05.994 --> 19:08.030
We're so glad
you picked us up...

19:08.063 --> 19:10.032
-Chris O'Donnell?
-That's right.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.801
And I hope
you like turbulence, dildos.

19:12.835 --> 19:14.703
NARRATOR:
The actual Chris O'Donnell

19:14.737 --> 19:17.240
is not a Coast Guard
helicopter pilot.

19:17.273 --> 19:19.275
We assume
he's probably too short.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.148
Oh, my God.
Brian, are you okay?

19:26.181 --> 19:27.516
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:27.550 --> 19:28.884
Annie, are you okay?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.520
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

19:31.554 --> 19:33.021
What happened to her?

19:33.055 --> 19:34.357
She was hit by, uh...

19:34.390 --> 19:36.191
She was struck
by a smooth criminal.

19:36.225 --> 19:37.860
That was fun, Mom.

19:37.893 --> 19:40.496
We don't get to do a lot
of that kind of stuff together.

19:40.529 --> 19:43.532
Listen, Brian,
we want you to come home again.

19:43.566 --> 19:46.935
Oh, so the Twitter pariah
is finally welcome home?

19:46.969 --> 19:49.872
No, but the school board
hero dog is.

19:49.905 --> 19:51.707
It was all over the papers.

19:51.740 --> 19:55.177
You saved the school $206
from all the food they recovered

19:55.210 --> 19:57.045
from Principal Shepherd's
fridge.

19:57.079 --> 19:59.748
So... you really want me
to come home?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.850
They're still gonna serve
that food?

20:01.884 --> 20:04.753
Of course we do.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.755
Hey, where's everyone else?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.191
Oh, my God.
Peter, what happened?

20:09.224 --> 20:11.126
PETER:
What happened? A fair question.

20:11.159 --> 20:13.896
And to answer it,
we have to go back a ways.

20:13.929 --> 20:16.299
-STEWIE: Stop doing that thing!
-Aw.

20:21.570 --> 20:24.440
Brian, I got to say, it's great
to have you home again, buddy.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.941
Well, it's great to be here.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.276
Living on my own was fun,

20:27.310 --> 20:29.378
but I couldn't stop thinking
about all the stuff

20:29.412 --> 20:30.913
I was missing
being away from you guys.

20:30.946 --> 20:32.881
Did you ever finish
that banana, Brian?

20:32.915 --> 20:35.984
And, Meg, I hope you learned
your lesson about drinking.

20:36.018 --> 20:39.054
Yeah, I think I'd rather
live my life as a loser

20:39.087 --> 20:41.123
than feel bad once in a while.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.992
Well, I hope you know
that you're our loser.

20:44.026 --> 20:46.028
Thanks, Mom.

20:53.268 --> 20:55.804
CHRIS:
If my life were better here,

20:55.838 --> 20:59.808
would I stop searching
for it... up there?
