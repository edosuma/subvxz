WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:05.504
- l'm home.
- [Jill] Hi.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.167
l picked up the mail.

00:08.708 --> 00:12.974
You're invited to your annual
psychology department potluck dinner.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.482
l am one step ahead of them.
l'm already making my tuna surprise.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.574
l'll take a big step backwards.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.453
They've banned you
from bringing any food this year.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.917
Yeah. Like they wrote that
on the invitation.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.120
They wrote it on the invitation.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.899
That's pretty insensitive
for a bunch of psychologists.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.902
Maybe they need some therapy, honey.

00:38.938 --> 00:42.237
- ls my tuna surprise really that bad?
- [quietly] Mm.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.237
- No, you know...
- The truth.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.074
Truth is a relative thing, honey.

00:48.648 --> 00:51.014
Truth is, even your relatives
won't eat it.

00:52.919 --> 00:53.886
l'll show them.

00:53.987 --> 00:58.549
With thought and creativity l can
make them forget the tuna surprise.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.489
Like the antidote.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.081
- [Tim] Ow!
- [electrical buzzing]

02:03.156 --> 02:05.852
Hey, uh, Dad. Can a friend of mine
come see the hot rod?

02:05.925 --> 02:08.985
Yeah. lt's about time you started
hanging out with car guys.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.992
Dad, this is Lauren.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.791
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hey.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.929
- Where's the car guy?
- l'm the car guy.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.434
Lauren and l are working
on the school paper together.

02:23.510 --> 02:27.071
- OK.
- This is an original old convertible.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.808
- lt's all metal, too.
- lt's a Ford.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.646
Yes, l know.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.317
- l'm guessing it's a '46.
- Huh?

02:38.224 --> 02:39.851
Look at these tail lights.

02:39.926 --> 02:43.054
- You are gonna French 'em, aren't ya?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:43.129 --> 02:45.996
- Did you chop the windshield frame?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.766
- You gotta shave these door handles.
- Yeah, l gotta. Oh.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.968
- You know a lot about cars for a girl.
- For a girl?

02:55.041 --> 02:56.872
Or a boy. Either one.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.808
l always loved anything with a motor.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.644
My friends play with Barbie,
l soup up her Corvette.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.081
- The pink Corvette?
- Yeah.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.619
With the spoiler in the back
and the mag wheels.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.052
- l loved that thing.
- Wow.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.291
- How would you know?
- Never mind.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.821
Come on, Randy.
Let's get to work.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.865
Thanks for letting me
check out your car.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.060
- Anytime. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.363
Hey, Randy, Randy.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.994
Your girlfriend's terrific.

03:26.072 --> 03:29.007
Dad, she's not my girlfriend.
We're just friends.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.975
She's perfect for you.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.206
No, Dad.
Actually, she's perfect for you.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.283
You know, Lauren... Hi.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.754
You and l make a great writing team.

03:52.498 --> 03:56.935
You know, Lauren, l wasn't into cars
at all until you came along.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.305
You know, Lauren...

04:05.612 --> 04:07.273
...l'm a big geek.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.076
- [knocking on door]
- [Brad] Hey, Randy?

04:12.151 --> 04:13.311
Yeah?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.315
Hi.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.095
So, uh, who were you just talking to?

04:25.164 --> 04:26.825
No one. That was the radio.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.792
What radio?

04:29.902 --> 04:31.062
My, uh...

04:31.671 --> 04:33.832
My, uh... deodorant radio.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.576
Sounds great, keeps me dry all day.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.745
Man, he's not even my weird brother.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.282
Hey, don't be so hard on him.

04:44.350 --> 04:49.117
Randy, may l say l've always found you
to be a very upstanding young man

04:49.188 --> 04:51.748
with a strong commitment to hygiene.

04:52.525 --> 04:53.787
Jason, what do you want?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.088
Brad?

04:55.161 --> 04:58.528
Well, Jason's gonna be getting
some tickets to a concert and, uh...

04:58.631 --> 05:00.724
- You're inviting me to go?
- [both] No.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.436
We're inviting you
to lend us money so we can go.

05:04.504 --> 05:05.801
lt's very simple.

05:05.872 --> 05:09.103
Oh. And, uh,
l'm inviting you to bite me. OK?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.908
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.038
Whoa. The hygiene thing
always works for me.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.478
Let's just go try it on Mark.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.676
Are you wearing enough cologne,
tough guy?

05:19.752 --> 05:22.721
'Cause l can still almost breathe.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.260
Give him a break. He's trying to smell
good for his girlfriend, Lauren.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.886
Look, she is not my girlfriend.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.089
We're writing an article for the paper.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.462
On what? Guys who stink?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.871
Tim, which dish should l make
for the potluck?

05:41.941 --> 05:44.671
l got ltalian, French, Chinese...

05:44.744 --> 05:46.712
Um... go with British.

05:48.881 --> 05:52.942
lf the meal is horrible people will
think that's how it's supposed to taste.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.251
- [doorbell]
- l'll get it.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.688
- Where did you get all those cookbooks?
- l don't know. lt's strange.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.726
People keep giving them to me.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.253
- lt is strange. Hi, Lauren.
- Hey.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.060
- Come in.
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.293
Hi.

06:08.401 --> 06:11.370
- Did you come to look at the hot rod?
- l have to work with Randy.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.837
But my dad and l were talking
about your hot rod.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.601
And, well, we had an idea.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.872
And that idea would be?

06:17.944 --> 06:20.504
Have you ever thought about
sectioning the hood?

06:20.580 --> 06:24.676
lt would bring the front end down
two inches, and give it a sleek look.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.351
This is exactly why l told you
how badly l wanted a daughter.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.689
But you know,
we ended up with three fine sons.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.961
One of them is waiting for you now.
He's excited about the article.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.263
- Yeah, me too.
- What is it about, cars?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.167
No, it's about school budget cuts.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.866
lt's called,
''Why Must the Ballet Club Suffer?''

06:47.940 --> 06:51.000
Easy. So the audience
isn't the only one in pain.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.106
- l'll see you guys later.
- All right.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.788
l think Randy's got
a terrific little girlfriend.

07:04.857 --> 07:08.122
She's not his girlfriend.
He's made it clear. She's just a friend.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.095
<i>Yep. Yep. And Al's the funny one
on Tool Time.</i>

07:14.634 --> 07:17.398
Do you have some inside
l don't know about?

07:17.470 --> 07:20.098
Come on. lt's pretty obvious, isn't it?

07:20.173 --> 07:23.199
We've got a 1 4-year-old son
writing about the ballet?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.834
Which means?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.011
Either he really likes her,

07:29.081 --> 07:31.845
or we should be having
a whole other discussion.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.251
Well, we have a great show
for you today.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.658
<i>We're doing our Tool Time salute
to women...</i>

07:42.728 --> 07:44.889
- [screeching tires]
- [crashing]

07:45.498 --> 07:46.863
...and cars.

07:48.434 --> 07:51.528
Some people think that cars
are strictly a man's domain.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.438
l'd be the last to admit it, but this
week l met a bright 1 4-year-old girl

07:55.508 --> 07:59.239
who proved to me there's women out there
who know as much about cars as men.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.372
Actually, Tim, we have a female expert
in our audience

08:02.448 --> 08:04.939
who probably knows more about cars
than you do.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.848
- Who's in the audience?
- Let's just say

08:06.919 --> 08:09.547
<i>she was the cover girl
for Transmission Monthly.</i>

08:09.622 --> 08:11.522
So, you got a real car babe, huh?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.555
Well, she's actually sitting
in the front row there.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.823
Well, what the heck?
Let's bring her down here.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.062
<i>All right.
Let's have a warm Tool Time welcome</i>

08:24.136 --> 08:26.195
for Lucille Treganowan.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.110
Hi, Lucille.
Welcome to the show.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.743
l'm happy to be here.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.788
l'm happy you're here.
So, um...

08:44.222 --> 08:45.918
So, um, what do you do?

08:45.992 --> 08:49.655
Well, actually, she's just written
a book about car repair.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.159
- What kind of car do you drive?
- An '86 Park Avenue.

08:53.232 --> 08:54.392
[whistles]

08:55.167 --> 08:57.328
Does it run on Metamucil?

09:00.206 --> 09:02.140
That baby has a four barreled carb,

09:02.208 --> 09:06.645
high-rise manifold, and it will blow
your car right off the road, little man.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.914
[inaudible]

09:09.982 --> 09:13.315
Well, you know, l just read your book
a couple of months ago.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.751
l couldn't put it down.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.151
Oh, thank you, Al.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.247
You had to read a book about cars, Al?

09:18.324 --> 09:20.292
lf you'd read Lucille's book you'd know

09:20.359 --> 09:23.920
women have come up with ways to repair
cars men never even thought of.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.863
- Like what?
- What if you had a split radiator hose?

09:26.933 --> 09:28.059
Duh!

09:29.068 --> 09:30.535
You replace it.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.504
OK. lt's 3:00 in the morning
and you're stranded.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.803
l'd call you, wake you up
and you'd put it on.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.703
But if you were a woman,
you'd take off your scarf.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.407
- You'd take off your belt...
- Lucille!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.115
lt's a family show, honey.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.585
You wrap the scarf around
the split hose,

09:50.323 --> 09:53.759
and then tighten the belt
around the scarf.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.192
- That's a great idea.
- [applause]

10:01.500 --> 10:04.765
There are other ways that women
have an advantage over men.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.896
We have this heightened
sense of smell.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.305
That's right.
Which easily enables them

10:09.375 --> 10:12.071
to detect car problems by their odor.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.204
- Anybody can do that.
- OK, wise guy.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.145
What if you have a sweet,
steamy smell coming from your car?

10:19.218 --> 10:22.449
- What would that mean?
- l had too many kielbasas at lunch.

10:25.658 --> 10:26.818
No, Tim.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.793
That would mean that your car
is leaking hot coolant.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.955
Actually, they're both right.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.430
OK, chicken cacciatore...

10:37.503 --> 10:39.403
We gotta dredge the chicken.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.099
What does ''dredge'' mean?

10:41.173 --> 10:43.334
l have no idea.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.377
Go look it up
in that cooking encyclopedia.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.909
l'm gonna move on.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.414
Mince half an onion.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.452
While you're looking up ''dredge''
look up ''mince''.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.853
All right. l found ''dredge''.
lt means coat the chicken with flour.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.692
l know how to do that!
OK, come here.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.564
Yeah. Put the chicken in there.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.163
OK.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.498
Then we dump in some flour.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.263
Here we go.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.736
All right.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.777
And we close the bag.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.036
And shake.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.460
<i>Whatcha doing, The Hokey Poultry?</i>

11:41.267 --> 11:44.361
You grab a bag of chicken
and you shake it all around.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.496
Just remember, it's all in the wrist.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.136
- Here, take this one.
- OK.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.733
- How's the article coming?
- lt's going great.

11:51.811 --> 11:55.247
Lauren's coming over tomorrow to finish.
We're working well together.

11:55.314 --> 11:58.477
- She seems like a nice girl.
- Yeah, l really like her.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.677
You know, her... her writing.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.085
- [doorbell rings]
- l'll get that.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.713
Yeah, yeah.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.618
Oh. Hey, Randy.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.185
Hi. What are you doing here?

12:11.263 --> 12:13.629
We're picking up Brad and Angela
to go to a concert.

12:13.699 --> 12:16.463
- Who's we?
- ''We'' would be me.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.404
- You?
- Me.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.973
Angela said she's late
so we'll have to get her on the way.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.203
- Be home by 1 2:00.
- All right, Mom. Love you.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.242
- See you tomorrow, Randy.
- Right. OK.

12:36.388 --> 12:39.448
l didn't know that Lauren
was going out with Jason.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.390
Yeah, neither did l.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.293
- You all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.389
- Sure you're not upset?
- Why would l be upset?

12:47.466 --> 12:50.731
l don't know. 'Cause a nice girl
like that's going out with Jason.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.293
Why should l care, Mom?

12:52.371 --> 12:55.829
l told you a million times,
Lauren and l are just friends.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.308
[Jill] Tim?

13:02.381 --> 13:03.871
You were right.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.439
[Tim] l know.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.646
Don't you want to know about what?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.883
Don't care.
l just love being right.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.292
Randy does have feelings for Lauren but
Lauren doesn't have feelings for him.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.125
She's going out with Jason.

13:19.198 --> 13:20.756
Nyah.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.101
What could she possibly see in Jason?

13:25.171 --> 13:27.298
That guy's dad drives a Pacer.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.243
Well, Randy's really hurting.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.177
You remember what it feels like
to be rejected.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.238
Yes, l do.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.476
l remember hearing
every excuse in the book.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.917
[high-pitched voice]
''l gotta wash my hair.''

13:41.020 --> 13:44.148
''No, no, no. l've got a touch
of the plague. That's what l've got.''

13:44.223 --> 13:47.056
''No, no. l've got to de-worm
my schnauzer.''

13:48.060 --> 13:50.028
You must have felt awful.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.858
Yeah, but you came around.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.656
Well, l feel really bad for Randy.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.634
We're not gonna take this lying down.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.069
- What are we talking about?
- We'll get her back.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.503
We never had her!

14:03.843 --> 14:06.505
We're gonna play up the car thing, OK?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.946
l'll invite her over to the garage.
We'll work on the hot rod.

14:10.049 --> 14:13.610
While we're shaving the door handles,
l'll talk Randy up big time,

14:13.719 --> 14:16.279
do a couple of my jokes.
Bing, bang, boom.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.015
We got her back.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.383
Tim, that's not gonna work.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.951
Apparently, you've never
seen me in action.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.054
Unfortunately, l have.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.103
Hi, Wilson.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.535
What's all that smoke?

14:36.609 --> 14:39.237
Well, Jill,
l'm burning food as a sacrifice

14:39.311 --> 14:42.144
for the Chinese festival
of hungry ghosts.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.875
Well, that's a switch.

14:43.949 --> 14:47.248
For once l'm cooking something good
and you're burning food.

14:47.319 --> 14:50.186
Of course, the people eating my food
are already dead.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.424
l'm making chicken cacciatore.
You got any fresh oregano?

14:57.496 --> 14:59.225
Yes, indeed.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.790
l just picked a fresh batch here
to burn for my ghosts.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.392
Thanks.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.928
You, uh, happen to have anything
for a broken heart?

15:08.974 --> 15:12.432
Randy is devastated because this girl
that he really likes

15:12.511 --> 15:16.174
- is going out with somebody else.
- Ah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.818
Oh, l know how painful that can be.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.581
l'll never forget losing my first love,
Debbie Ann.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.591
We were in fourth grade.
l guess we were about nine years of age.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.823
We were inseparable until one day
at the playground we had a big fight.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.090
About what?

15:32.164 --> 15:34.598
<i>l was a big believer
in laissez-faire capitalism,</i>

15:34.667 --> 15:36.430
and she was a neo-Maist.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.695
- Kids.
- Mm-hmm. True.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.938
l wish l could make Randy feel better.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.172
Well, unfortunately,
during those turbulent teenage years,

15:47.246 --> 15:49.214
there's not really much a parent can do.

15:49.315 --> 15:52.182
lt just goes totally
against my instincts.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.516
l mean, when my kid has a problem,
l just want to rush in and fix it.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.488
But if Randy learns
to fend for himself now,

15:58.557 --> 16:01.720
then when he's an adult
he'll be more independent.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.355
Well, who better to help him
be independent than his mother?

16:07.599 --> 16:11.126
Jill, l know this is rough on you,
but Randy will get through this.

16:11.203 --> 16:14.263
ln the words of famous German
philosopher Friedrich Nietzche,

16:14.340 --> 16:18.674
''That which does not destroy me
only makes me stronger''.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.235
What did Nietzche know?
He wasn't a mother.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.479
Jill, maybe you're being
just a wee bit overprotective.

16:25.584 --> 16:28.348
Oh, what do you know?
You're not a mother either.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.513
Well, thanks for stopping by.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.182
lt's always a pleasure.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.255
Mom, hi.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.558
What are you doing up?

16:43.635 --> 16:46.570
l gotta put away the chicken cacciatore.
What are you doing?

16:46.638 --> 16:50.199
l was just waiting for Brad to get back
from the concert.

16:50.309 --> 16:51.742
They're a little late.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.677
Yeah, Jason probably got them
backstage passes.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.305
How would he do that?

16:56.382 --> 17:00.045
Oh, by complimenting the security guard
on his hygiene.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.422
Did you hear that car door?

17:04.490 --> 17:06.185
- No.
- Oh.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.692
Honey.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.726
lt really hurt my feelings

17:13.799 --> 17:16.858
when they didn't want me
to cook anything for the potluck.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.993
lt hurts to be rejected.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.767
Whether it's over cooking
or relationships.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.541
You're not comparing your tuna surprise
to my life?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.712
Not anymore.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.014
Well, Mom, at least your tuna surprise
got a chance.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.789
l never got my chance with Lauren.
l waited too long and now it's too late.

17:38.857 --> 17:42.190
Honey, it's one concert.
lt's just one date.

17:42.928 --> 17:47.092
lf l had to choose between you and Jason
it would definitely be you.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.962
You're my mother.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.536
Jason is obnoxious.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.573
He's sneaky. His father drives a Pacer,
for God's sake.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.472
So, you're saying
l might still have a chance with Lauren.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.210
Honey, if there's hope for me
to cook a decent meal,

18:05.284 --> 18:07.946
there's hope for you and Lauren.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.017
So, you're saying there's no hope?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.587
All right, all right.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.886
Try this.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.060
Come on.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.738
Wow. That's...
That's fantastic.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.831
- lt tastes like food.
- Yeah!

18:32.711 --> 18:33.871
Gosh.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.446
You know, they say

18:35.514 --> 18:39.041
that it's hard for teenage boys
to open up to their mothers.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.881
So, l guess...

18:40.986 --> 18:43.546
...you and l have
a very special relationship.

18:44.323 --> 18:48.692
l mean, we share our emotions
and our innermost feelings.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.421
lt really moves me

18:50.496 --> 18:53.795
when you have a problem
and you feel comfortable coming to me,

18:53.866 --> 18:56.494
pouring out your heart...

18:56.568 --> 18:58.195
Randy?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.099
Ran...

19:01.640 --> 19:02.800
Well...

19:04.743 --> 19:08.304
''So, according to Mrs. Rupinni,
without funding for the ballet club,

19:08.413 --> 19:10.506
there will be no production this year.''

19:10.582 --> 19:13.745
''Students, teachers and parents,
we are due to speak up.

19:13.852 --> 19:18.084
<i>Don't let this be the swan song
for Swan Lake. ''</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:20.022
Hey, that's a great ending.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.822
You know, Randy,
you and l make a pretty great team.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.556
Yeah, we do, don't we?

19:25.764 --> 19:28.995
Well, l'd better go.
l've still got tons of homework to do.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.297
Uh, Lauren, you got a minute?

19:31.370 --> 19:32.928
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

19:33.038 --> 19:36.940
Uh, nothin' special, it's just
we've been working the whole time.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.534
We really haven't had a chance to talk.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.772
Well, what do you want to talk about?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.610
You know, whatever.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.810
Weather, politics,
how your date with Jason went.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.550
lt wasn't a date.
A bunch of us went to see a concert.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.023
Oh. See, l thought it was a date.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.423
So did Jason.

19:55.494 --> 19:59.123
He kept putting his arm around me
and complimenting my hygiene.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.929
What a jerk.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.162
l'd never be interested
in someone like him.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.795
- That's fantastic.
- lt is?

20:07.873 --> 20:11.331
Well, no. l mean, not for Jason.
But it would be for...

20:11.410 --> 20:16.279
...the guy you would be interested in
going out with, whoever that might be.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.441
Randy, what are you trying to say?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.777
Well, um...

20:23.455 --> 20:27.221
l was just wondering, you know,
if you're not too busy sometime,

20:27.292 --> 20:29.556
maybe you'd like to go out on a date.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.495
- l don't think so.
- OK. Forget l said it. Bad idea.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.759
No.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.664
No, it's not you, Randy.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.297
lt's just that...
l'm not ready to start dating yet.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.864
l'm just having more fun
hanging out with my friends.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.969
- Like you and me hang out?
- Yeah.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.277
Cool. And then when you are ready
to start dating?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.677
l just hope you're still available.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.119
Well, at the moment
my calendar's wide open.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.719
Hey, Lauren.
Randy, just the car guy l'm lookin' for.

21:02.794 --> 21:07.060
l got those tickets to the hot rod show
you wanted to go to. He loves his cars.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.533
- Dad, l...
- Guess who l saw at the ticket office.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.764
Jason's parole officer.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.544
He doesn't hold out a lot of promise
for that kid.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.173
l pity the woman that dates
a guy like that, l'll tell you that.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.517
What women need

21:26.585 --> 21:29.554
are good car-loving,
ballet-appreciating guys.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.282
Kinda like Randy.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.914
Randy?

21:34.393 --> 21:35.519
Lauren?

21:42.267 --> 21:45.293
l'm so proud of Randy
for telling Lauren how he felt.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.928
Yeah, they're still friends.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.531
Which means she still might stop over
and help me work on the car.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.510
lf l had known a girl
could turn out like Lauren

21:54.613 --> 21:57.514
l might have tried for a daughter.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.743
l've always told you
how much fun it would be

21:59.851 --> 22:02.217
to have a girl around the house.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.482
Spoil her and buy her
little girly things.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.147
That's so sweet.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.089
What would you buy for her?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.651
Oh, a little pink ratchet set.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.833
A soft, cuddly,
little stuffed muscle car.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.470
Baby's first tire iron.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.300
And what would you do
when your adorable little girl

22:24.409 --> 22:27.901
started dating guys like Jason?

22:27.979 --> 22:30.345
Well, that's what the tire iron's for.
