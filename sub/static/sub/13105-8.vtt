00:57.390 --> 00:58.789

00:58.820 --> 01:00.651
I MEAN, I'M NOT EXACTLY
A DETAILS PERSON,

01:00.690 --> 01:03.158
BUT I CAN EVEN TELL THAT THIS
SHIP IS HEADED FOR THE ROCKS.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.487
SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.225
THE PLACE CARDS, THE PLAYLIST,
THE BOUTONNIERES...

01:06.260 --> 01:07.352
OKAY, WELL, HERE'S

01:07.400 --> 01:08.719
NOELLE'S GOT A KID, OKAY?

01:08.760 --> 01:10.625
SHE'S--SHE'S JUST JUGGLING
A LOT OF STUFF RIGHT NOW.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.490
SHE'S DISTRACT ED.
IT'S NORMAL.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.599
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS THING
A THING OF BEAUTY,

01:14.640 --> 01:17.632
ROMANCE, AND--AND JUST
FULL OF POSSIBILITY.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.730
* MAYBE >.IJL|J<SI'£SONE KISS

01:20.780 --> 01:23.499
DON'T FEEL THREATENED.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.245
I BROUGHT MY OWN
CALLIGRAPHY PEN.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.770
* WE COULD GET IT ON

01:26.820 --> 01:29.414
* AND ON AND ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON *

01:29.450 --> 01:31.247

01:37.430 --> 01:38.783
OH.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.253
OKAY. I DON'T NEED THIS.
ALREADY GOT ANOTHER DRESS.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.222
I'VE NEVER MET A WOMAN
WHO PACKS LIGHTER THAN ME.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.397
(chuckles) LOOK, I'M GOING
TO MIAMI TO HAVE FUN,

01:45.430 --> 01:47.534
AND I CAN'T HAVE FUN IF I'M
LOADED DOWN WITH STUFF.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.162
I SHOULD GET YOU ONE OF THOSE
VACUUM ATTACHMENTS.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.529
YOU CAN SUCK THE AIR
RIGHT OUT OF THAT THING.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.401
YEAH, I ALREADY HAVE ONE.
DOESN'T HELP.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.534
SO I DO THE ROLL-AND-SQUEEZE.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.741
WORKS... LIKE A CHARM.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.249
(rubs hands)
UH...

02:02.290 --> 02:03.643
YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD GO,
DO YOU?

02:03.690 --> 02:05.248
OF COURSE I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.655
YOU'VE HAD IT PLANNED
FOR MONTHS.
(sighs) I KNOW.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.248
BUT SKIPPING MY 3055'
WEDDING--

02:08.290 --> 02:10.383
I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
POLITICS, OPTICS--

02:10.430 --> 02:11.829
6O PEOPLE THERE,
NOBODY'S GONNA NOTICE.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.657
AND YOU ALREADY TOLD FRANK
YOU CAN'T COME.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.395
HE WAS FINE.

02:15.430 --> 02:18.297
YOU THINK I'M BURNT OUT,
DON'T YOU?
(sets cup down)

02:20.200 --> 02:21.497
YOU NEED A RIDE
TO THE AIRPORT?

02:21.540 --> 02:24.304
(laughs) NO. I'M FINE.
I CAN GET A CAB.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.331
MARLO, I'M GIVING YOU
A DAMN RIDE

02:26.380 --> 02:29.133

02:54.000 --> 02:56.400
4,000 OF WHICH INVOLVE

02:59.510 --> 03:01.375

03:01.410 --> 03:02.946
(siren whoops)
YES, IT'S FINE.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.572
I'VE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME
FOR A MONTH.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.804
OKAY? I CAN TAKE
A PERSONAL DAY.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.818

03:14.560 --> 03:16.619
WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
WE COULD CHANGE THAT LIGHT BULB.

03:16.660 --> 03:19.299
YEAH, WELL, I ACTUALLY
DID NEED THAT CHANGED, BUT...

03:19.330 --> 03:21.798
OH, I KNOW. IT WAS HIGH
UP THERE. HARD TO REACH.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.468
NO, I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
GETTING DRESSED IN THE DARK.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.922
YOU MIGHT PUT YOUR UNDERWEAR
ON BACKWARDS.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.631
THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
(chuckles)

03:26.670 --> 03:28.831
I MIGHT HAVE THEM ON
BACKWARDS RIGHT NOW.
(chuckles)

03:28.870 --> 03:30.861
YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING THAT
MIGHT MAKE IT BE'I'I'ER THOUGH?

03:30.910 --> 03:31.934
TEQUILA?

03:50.690 --> 03:51.952
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A BRAND.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.526
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE IN BRANDING

03:53.560 --> 03:55.027
WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.492
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
KEEP THIS UP MUCH LONGER.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.531

NOELLE AND ZOE ARE FRIENDS.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.823

05:31.530 --> 05:32.997
KINDA WHY I HATE
BIG WEDDINGS.
(engine starts)

05:33.030 --> 05:34.725
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A CELEBRATION OF LOVE

05:34.760 --> 05:36.569
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE,
BUT REALLY,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.693
EVERYONE'S SO CONCERNED
WITH WHAT THEY'RE WEARING

05:38.730 --> 05:39.936
AND WHO THEY'RE
GOING HOME WITH.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.131
I THINK IT'S THE FAKEST
THING IN THE WORLD.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.035
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.958
UH...

I'M GONNA TAKE THAT BACK,
'CAUSE I THINK THERE IS

06:07.860 --> 06:09.088
SOMETHING FAKER THAN
A BIG WEDDING.

06:09.130 --> 06:10.768
IT'S YOU.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.097
CHLOE PRICE, IT'S YOU.

06:12.130 --> 06:13.028

(singing off-key with stereo)
* IT'S NOT THAT I WANT YOU

06:19.880 --> 06:26.171
* NOT TO SAY, BUT IF YOU
ONLY KNEW *

06:26.210 --> 06:29.839
* HOW EASY

06:29.890 --> 06:37.524
* IT WOULD BE
TO SHOW ME HOW YOU FEEL *

06:37.560 --> 06:40.620
* MORE THAN WORDS

06:40.660 --> 06:43.823
* IS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
(beat-boxmg)

06:43.870 --> 06:45.826
THERE'S A B&E ON BERKELEY
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.633
COME ON, I KNOW
YOU LOVE THIS SONG.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.137
YOU USED TO SING IT
ALL THE TIME UNDERCOVER.

06:49.170 --> 06:52.037
IT WAS EXTREMELY IRRITATING.
REMEMBER?

06:52.070 --> 06:55.574

MAN, IT IS SATURDAY, OKAY?

06:55.610 --> 06:57.043
WE GET OFF AT 4:00.
WE GO TO A WEDDING.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.843
YOU GET TO DRESS NICE,
DRINK A BARREL OF CHAMPAGNE,

06:58.880 --> 07:00.848
AND FLIRT WITH COMPLETE
STRANGERS.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.144
OH, YOU NEED A WINGMAN.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.646

07:04.690 --> 07:06.146
THAT SOUNDS_GREAT.
(normal v0Ice)
YEAH, I GOT YOU.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.112
WE GET TO LISTEN TO MUSIC
LIKE THIS ALL NIGHT

07:08.160 --> 07:10.185
WHILE GAIL STARES DAGGERS
INTO THE WHITES OF MY EYES.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.857
I CAN'T WAIT. REALLY.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.994
IT'S GONNA BE A NIGHT
TO REMEMBER.

07:14.030 --> 07:17.625
(radio static)
(woman) 1504, there's a tour bus
stalled under the underpass

07:17.670 --> 07:19.490
at Adelaide and Eastern
blocking the west lane.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.837
We need to get it moved.
(clicks)

07:20.870 --> 07:22.235
MARK 1504.
(scoffs)

07:22.270 --> 07:24.568
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
(radIo static)

07:24.610 --> 07:25.838
(sighs)
(engine accelerates)

07:35.250 --> 07:37.980
(radio chatter)

07:39.190 --> 07:40.851
(door closes)
WHAT, IS IT EMPTY?

07:40.890 --> 07:41.982
I DON'T SEE A DRIVER.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.822
(knocks on glass)
WE'RE LOCKED IN!

07:45.860 --> 07:47.953
OKAY, THERE'S A MANUAL
OVERRIDE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM!

07:48.000 --> 07:50.161
YOU JUST PULL IT.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING!

07:50.200 --> 07:51.963
NO? OKAY.
OKAY.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.661
SIR, CAN YOU PLEASE JUST
STEP BACK?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.964

(whooshes)

07:56.000 --> 07:57.501
WHOA, WHOA! EASY, NINJA!
MM.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.598
(whirring, radio chatter
continues)

08:00.640 --> 08:02.039
HMM.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.649
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.240
THEY TOOK OUR CELL PHONES.
WE COULDN'T CALL 9-1-1.
(people murmurIng)

08:07.280 --> 08:09.714
YOU NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE.
TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.638
SIR, CAN YOU PLEASE HAVE
A SEAT? THANK YOU.
1504, WE NEED E.M.S.

08:11.690 --> 08:12.918
TO THE UNDERPASS
AT EASTERN AND ADELAIDE.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.258
WE HAVE TWO MEN WITH INJURIES.
BOTH APPEAR TO BE IN THEIR 60$.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.952
'705. ACTUALLY, BILL'S 81.
(radio chatter)

08:17.990 --> 08:20.049
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.591
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?
I MEAN, WHERE DID THE DRIVER GO?

08:22.630 --> 08:25.690
H-HE PULLED OUT A GUN
AND HE PUNCHED BILL IN THE FACE.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.698
I-I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.265
HE TOOK EVERYTHING WE HAD
AND WENT OUT THE DOOR.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.608
HE RAN OFF ON FOOT.
SIR? ANDY,
HE'S STOPPED BREATHING.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.130
(gasping)

08:35.710 --> 08:38.770
(man) IF YOU COULD JUST STEP
OFF TO THE SIDE HERE...
WATCH YOUR STEP, PLEASE.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.175
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.972
POOR GUY'S IN SHOCK.
WE'LL GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.612
HE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT,
THOUGH.
OKAY.

08:43.650 --> 08:46.619
(sirens wailing)

08:46.660 --> 08:47.718
(siren whoops and stops)

08:47.760 --> 08:50.684
(radio chatter)

08:52.130 --> 08:53.199
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

08:53.230 --> 08:55.926
A TOUR BUS SHOWED UP
AN HOUR AGO AT BEDFORD HOUSE.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.962
IT'S A FANCY RETIREMENT HOME
IN YORKVILLE.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.036
WHERE WERE THEY HEADED?
UH, TO A CASINO
IN NIAGARA FALLS.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.231
SO THE BUS DRIVER STOPPED
IN THE UNDERPASS,

09:02.270 --> 09:04.602
PUT A STOCKING ON HIS FACE,
PULLS OUT A GUN,

09:04.640 --> 09:08.007
AND DEMANDED ALL THEIR CASH,
JEWELRY, CELL PHONES.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.247
PUT EVERYTHING IN A KNAPSACK
AND TOOK OFF ON FOOT.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.612
HE WENT NORTH.
TWO OF THEM TRIED
TO RESIST.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.618
THEY GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE
FOR THEIR EFFORTS.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.015
I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T PUT THESE FOLKS

09:16.050 --> 09:18.211
IN MY--IN MY SQUAD.
IT'S A TOTAL MESS.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.013
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE REALLY
NEED IS A BUS.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.278
REALLY? YOU GUYS ARE GONNA MAKE
THEM GET BACK ON THERE?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.185
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS
THAT'S KIND OF MEAN?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.652
WELL, WHAT DO YOU GOT,
20 OF THEM?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.749
I DON'T KNOW.
GOD CLOSES A DOOR...

09:27.800 --> 09:29.665
AND HE OPENS A WINDOW.
WE CAN PUT THEM IN THERE.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.260
WE'LL STICK THEM BACK ON AS SOON
AS THE FORENSICS GUYS ARE DONE.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.030
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE, COLLINS.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.867
SIR.
(Andy scoffs)

09:36.910 --> 09:38.764
TYPICAL, HUH?
WHAT?

09:38.810 --> 09:40.300
THE ONE TIME THAT WE ALL
WANT TO GET OFF EARLY,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.706
AND NOW WE GOTTA INTERVIEW
A BUNCH OF SLOW-TALKING WALTERS.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.071
YEAH, SO?
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY
EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.044
YEAH, YOU LOVE WEDDINGS.
YEAH, I LOVE THEM.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.014
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
DON'T WORRY.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.779
I'LL SAVE A DANCE FOR YOU.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.687
(radio chatter)

09:53.720 --> 09:55.256
(breathes
and exhales sharply)

09:57.930 --> 09:58.988
(clicking)

09:59.030 --> 10:00.622
UH, CAN I BORROW YOUR PHONE?

10:00.660 --> 10:02.093
NO. NOT, YOU CAN'T. NO.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.621
DOV, LISTEN.
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE SOME

10:04.670 --> 10:06.194
PERP TO THE PROM,

10:06.230 --> 10:08.164
AND PROBABLY SHE'S NOT
GOING TO, UM...
(dialing phone)

10:08.200 --> 10:09.360
SHE'S NOT GONNA
REMEMBER ME.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.664
OKAY, SHE'S NOT A PERP.
WE NEVER ARRESTED HER.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.804
YEAH, I KNOW.
AND WHILE I AGREE
IT IS A LITTLE MESSY...

10:14.840 --> 10:17.274
UM...
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
EXCITING.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.777
NO, DON'T...
(radio chatter)

10:18.810 --> 10:20.038
(sighs)

10:20.080 --> 10:21.240
HELLO?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.039
HI. UM... THIS IS

10:36.870 --> 10:38.326
YEAH. NO. UH, I REMEMBER,

10:38.370 --> 10:39.792
I JUST DIDN'T THINK

10:46.470 --> 10:49.337
UH, TO GO TO A WEDDING

10:49.380 --> 10:51.348

10:53.980 --> 10:56.414
OKAY, THEN. UH, 6:00?

11:11.030 --> 11:12.861
FOR A SECURED, CONTROLLED
ENTRWVAY.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.731
IT'S AN OLD EXPRESSION,
"PORT" JUST MEANING DOOR,

11:14.770 --> 11:17.034
AND "SALLY" COMING FROM
THE MILITARY MANEUVER

11:17.070 --> 11:19.106

11:21.740 --> 11:23.901
UH... AS IT WERE.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.100

(sighs) LANCE, UH...
THAT'S MY BROTHER.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.927
HE, UH, HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BEST MAN.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.962
But... ass-hat missed
his flight from Jamaica.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.490
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
DON'T WANNA KNOW WHY,

11:48.540 --> 11:50.235
BUT RIGHT NOW...

11:50.270 --> 11:51.464
I DON'T HAVE A BEST MAN.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.000

12:05.950 --> 12:07.451
WE STILL GOTTA GET YOU

12:07.490 --> 12:09.754
(indistinct conversations)
HEY.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.280
HERE'S SOME EARL GREY

12:11.330 --> 12:13.525
THANK YOU.
I'M SORRY.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.892
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M SUDDENLY SO SHAKY.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.363
YOU'RE IN SHOCK.
YOU WERE ROBBED AT GUNPOINT

12:17.400 --> 12:19.163
AND YOU WATCHED TWO OF YOUR
FRIENDS GET BEATEN UP,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.065
AND NOW YOU'RE
IN A POLICE STATION.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.159
PLUS, YOU'RE OLD.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.906
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT
LIKE THAT...

12:25.940 --> 12:27.771
ALL RIGHT.
(sighs)

12:27.810 --> 12:29.846
WALTER, CONSTANCE,

12:29.880 --> 12:31.245

ENE-FRIENDS.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.843
FRENEMIES, YOU IDIOT.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.040
WE'VE HATED EACH OTHER
40 YEARS NOW.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.512
(door buzzes in background)

12:40.560 --> 12:42.380
ELEANOR, ANY DESCRIPTION
THAT YOU COULD GIVE US

12:42.420 --> 12:43.557
WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.

12:43.590 --> 12:45.455
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.993
YES, SORRY.
BUT ONE THING I CAN
TELL YOU--

12:48.030 --> 12:50.396
THERE WAS SOMETHING
STRANGE ABOUT HIS VOICE.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.069
YOU KNOW, IT WAS--
IT WAS LOW-PITCHED.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.261
FAKE, LIKE HE WAS
PUTTING IT ON.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.906
UH, I COULDN'T SEE MUCH. HE HAD
THAT STOCKING OVER HIS FACE.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.909
HE HAD A HAT ON, GLOVES.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.408
I WISH I'D PAID ATTENTION
TO HIM WHEN WE GOT ON,

13:04.450 --> 13:08.375
BUT I WAS TOO BUSY TRYING
TO FIND A GOOD SEAT FOR ELEANOR.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.614
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:09.650 --> 13:13.086
A BUNCH OF WELL-HEELED SENIORS
ALL OFF FOR A DAY AT THE SLOTS,

13:13.120 --> 13:14.587
FLUSH WITH CASH,

13:14.620 --> 13:17.088
EVERYONE DOLLED UP
IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.382
IT'S REALLY QUITE CLEVER.
THE PERFECT PLAN.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.125
(typing)
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
WE GOT SHARP EYEWITNESSES

13:21.160 --> 13:22.457
LIKE YOURSELF.
(laughs)

13:22.500 --> 13:25.321
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOUR SUIT--I LIKE IT.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.930
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
ARCHIE.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.232
ARCHIE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:29.270 --> 13:31.238
MOST EXCITEMENT
THAT'S HAPPENED IN 20 YEARS.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.999
(sighs)
YOUR BRIDGE NIGHTS
DON'T HOLD A CANDLE.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.270
JUNE HEATON. I'M THE MANAGER
AT BEDFORD HEALTH.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.471
YOU HIRED THE BUS?
YES, BUT I'VE BEEN USING

13:37.510 --> 13:39.501
PRINCESS COACHLINES
FOR SIX YEARS NOW.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.313
I HAVE NEVER, EVER
HAD A PROBLEM.

13:41.350 --> 13:42.578
OKAY, THIS BUS
WAS FROM HAWKLINE.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.110
HAWKLINE?
MM-HMM.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.947
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.059
YEAH?
OFFICER SHAW? HI.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.057
I TALKED TO THE BUS COMPANY,

13:48.090 --> 13:49.853
AND THEY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE DRIVER.

13:49.890 --> 13:52.029
BUT THEY DID SAY THAT THEY
RENTED IT TO A NEW CUSTOMER--

13:52.060 --> 13:54.051
GET THIS, THOUGH--
JOHN DOE.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.397
EXCUSE US.

13:56.660 --> 13:59.527
OKAY, SO, OUR BAD GUY,
HE CANCELS THE REGULAR BUS

13:59.570 --> 14:01.492
AND THEN HE RENTS
A DIFFERENT BUS

14:01.540 --> 14:03.007
UNDER A FAKE NAME.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.860
ALL RIGHT? THEN HE PICKS
THEM UP, TAKES THEM AWAY,

14:04.910 --> 14:06.161
ROBS THEM SILLY.

14:06.210 --> 14:08.337
ARCHIE, MY WITNESS--
GREAT GUY--

14:08.380 --> 14:10.268
HE SAYS IT'S
THE PERFECT PLAN.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.870
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT 20 WEALTHY
SENIORS LOADED DOWN

14:12.920 --> 14:14.410
WITH CASH AND JEWELRY.
IF YOU'RE THE DRIVER,

14:14.450 --> 14:15.644
YOU'RE IN AND OUT
IN FIVE MINUTES.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.887
IT'S AN INSIDE JOB.
IT IS THE PERFECT PLAN,

14:17.920 --> 14:19.410
BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW
THAT IT'S HAPPENING, RIGHT?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.509
SO SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE
MUST HAVE TIPPED OUR GUY OFF.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.926
OKAY.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.450
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:25.490 --> 14:28.095
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AT 'EM.
SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS,

14:28.130 --> 14:30.428
I NEED AN INVENTORY
OF STOLEN ITEMS, MOTIVE,

14:30.470 --> 14:32.324
SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR.

14:32.370 --> 14:33.564
ALL RIGHT? COME ON, GET ON IT.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.192
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
THROW 'EM IN THE LOUNGE.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.559
YEAH, BUT--
WHAT? BUT WHAT?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.431
WELL... THE WEDDING'S IN
LESS THAN FOUR HOURS.

14:38.470 --> 14:39.937
ALL RIGHT, THEN GET CRACKING,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.299
'CAUSE NOBODY LEAVES HERE
UNTIL THIS IS SORTED.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.001
(officers murmuring)
SORRY.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.905
OKAY...
(speaking indistinctly)

14:50.350 --> 14:52.011
(radio chatter)

14:52.050 --> 14:56.111
OKAY, SO, JUNE...
PRINCESS COACH LINES.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.457
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHO YOU TALKED TO.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.958
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.399
I-I DO THIS TRIP EVERY YEAR.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.920
AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE

15:02.970 --> 15:04.392
THAT THE BUS
WAS A DIFFERENT COMPANY?

15:04.430 --> 15:06.421
NO, I DIDN'T NOTICE.
AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THE DRIVER?

15:06.470 --> 15:07.937
NOTHING?
NOT ONE THING?

15:07.970 --> 15:10.507
I'M SORRY. I DON'T REMEMBER.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.202
MY HUSBAND JUST ARRIVED.
CAN I SAY HELLO?

15:13.240 --> 15:15.538
I WON'T GO ANYWHERE.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.978
DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.215
KEEPS APOLOGIZING.
I THINK SHE'S ON SOMETHING.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.649
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR
AND GUILT.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.112
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
AT HER PRETTY HARD.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.356
I WANT TO TALK
TO THE HUSBAND.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.618
I THINK WE FOUND
OUR BUS DRIVER.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.220
(inhales sharply) YEAH,
SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.989
(doors buzz)

15:33.030 --> 15:34.554
(radio chatter)

15:34.600 --> 15:36.659
WHAT?

15:36.700 --> 15:39.567
(speaking inaudibly)

15:39.600 --> 15:41.363
BUT, YOU KNOW, KEEP AT IT.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.231
YOU MAY CRACK HER YET.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.465
(alert beeps,
radio chatter)

15:45.510 --> 15:48.604
OKAY, SO HE GOT YOUR WATCH,
YOUR CUFFLINKS,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.608
$100 IN CASH,
AND YOUR WIFE'S PEARL NECKLACE.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.039
YEAH, THAT'S IT. I MEAN,
THAT'S THE SAD THING.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.217
YOU KNOW, THAT SOMEBODY
WOULD BEAT UP

15:54.250 --> 15:58.118
TWO OLD MEN FOR...
A BAG OF TRINKETS.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.618
MY WATCH, MY PHONE,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.355
MY DIAMOND EAR STUDS.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.984
HE EVEN TOOK
MY WEDDING RINGS.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.225
THREE RINGS.
THREE MARRIAGES.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.625
SHE WORE A WHITE DRESS
EVERY TIME,

16:08.660 --> 16:10.298
LIKE SHE WAS FOOLING
ANYONE.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.627
YEAH, BUT AT LEAST
I'VE BEEN MARRIED,

16:11.670 --> 16:13.638
UNLIKE BACHELOR OF THE YEAR
HERE.
(mouths word)

16:13.670 --> 16:16.036
YOU'RE A LUCKY GIRL.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.231
YOU STILL HAVE THAT
SPECIAL DAY AHEAD OF YOU.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.500
BIG PARTY, FRIENDS, FAMILY.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.770
ANNULMENT, DIVORCE,

16:22.810 --> 16:26.371
BEING DUMPED AT THE ALTAR,
PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT.

16:26.410 --> 16:29.413
YEAH, IT SOUNDS
PRETTY HEAVENLY.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.611
NOW, YOU I LIKE.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.208
(phone rings)

16:33.260 --> 16:35.057
GOT THE INSTRUCTIONS
RIGHT HERE.

16:35.090 --> 16:37.081
(man speaking indistinctly)
THERE ARE THE BEST
ONES, OKAY?

16:37.130 --> 16:39.086
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M SO NERVOUS.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.757
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
TWICE ALREADY.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.324
I SHOULD BE A FREAKIN'
PRO BY NOW.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.066
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
ALL RIGHT. THIS--

16:44.100 --> 16:47.228
COLLAR UP, TAKE THE TWO ENDS,
OVERHAND KNOT, RIGHT?

16:47.270 --> 16:49.238
I GUESS IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN IT'S THE REAL THING.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.738
YEAH. HOW DO YOU KNOW?
(man) VOIL.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.499
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.735
A NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE MINE,
YOU--YOU GROW UP THINKING

16:55.780 --> 16:58.601
THAT REAL MEN
DIDN'T SHOW HOW THEY FEEL.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.572
YOU KNOW? BUT, UH...

17:00.620 --> 17:02.247
IT WAS AN ACT, YOU KNOW?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.816
MACHO CRAP.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.512
BUT NOELLE NEVER BOUGHT
INTO IT.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.609
YOU KNOW, TO THIS DAY,

17:08.660 --> 17:11.220
SHE PULLS ME IN CLOSE
AND, UH,

17:11.260 --> 17:13.228
IF I'M HOLDING BACK,
SHE SAYS...

17:13.260 --> 17:16.229
(clicks tongue)
"IT'S JUST ME, FRANK.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.761
IT'S JUST ME."

17:17.800 --> 17:19.495
YOU KNOW IT'S REAL
WHEN, UH,

17:19.530 --> 17:21.361
WHEN SHE MAKES YOU BETTER.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.561
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH IT'S--
IT'S TOUGH SOMETIMES,

17:23.610 --> 17:25.339
BUT...

17:25.370 --> 17:27.201
BUT YOU'RE GRATEFUL.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.543
(chuckles)

17:30.580 --> 17:32.673
LET ME TRY THAT.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.519
YEAH. (chuckles)

17:34.550 --> 17:36.848
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.
(phone ringing)

17:36.880 --> 17:38.484
OKAY...

17:38.520 --> 17:40.317
IT'S NASH.
I'M GONNA ANSWER IT, OKAY?
YEAH. YEAH.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.248
(man) ONE END OF THE BOW TIE

17:42.290 --> 17:43.689
SHOULD BE LONGER
THAN THE OTHER.
HEY, NASH. WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.527
SAM? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THERE?

17:45.560 --> 17:47.255
LAST-MINUTE EMERGENCY.
GO FIGURE.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.528
LET'S HOPE THERE'S NOT
TWO OF THEM.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.221
IS NOELLE WITH YOU GUYS?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.226
NO. WHY?
Have you seen Noelle
today?

17:52.270 --> 17:55.364
NO. WHY?
Do you know if she's
checked in with Frank at all?

17:55.400 --> 17:56.833
No, don't ask him that.
In fact,

17:56.870 --> 17:58.565
DON'T ASK HIM ANYTHING.
JUST--JUST FORGET I CALLED.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.601
JUST FORGET I CALLED.
HEY, NASH,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:01.810 --> 18:03.277
NOELLE'S MISSING.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.868
We showed up
at the hotel.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.502
SHE DIDN'T CHECK IN
LAST NIGHT.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.370
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HER.
WE'VE CALLED HER ENTIRE FAMILY.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.671
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.381
OKAY, WELL, UH,
YOU'RE A DETECTIVE,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.650
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO SOME
DETECTIVE WORK AND GO FIND HER?

18:13.690 --> 18:15.885
THANKS.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.559
(phone beeps
and clatters on counter)

18:18.590 --> 18:20.558
FIND WHO?
SOMEONE MISSING?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.556
HEY! WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT?
HUH?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.568
(laughs)
VOIL.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.239
I'D MARRY YOU.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

18:27.270 --> 18:28.532
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?
JUST TALK TO HIM.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.764
(Archie)
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GREAT.
ARCHIE.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.358
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE SQUAD ROOM?

18:31.410 --> 18:32.763
ACCORDING TO MY PARTNER
HERE,

18:32.810 --> 18:35.233
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
IMPORTAI\}TD'|C')O TELL ME.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.498
SLATE-GRAY, DOUBLE VENTED.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.801
UH, 34 WAIST.

18:38.850 --> 18:41.444
CHARCOAL. AND I'D SAY
HE'S A 33.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.289
EPSTEIN, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

18:43.320 --> 18:46.517
TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE, OFFICER.
YOU'RE TAKING MY STATEMENT,

18:46.550 --> 18:48.279
AND WE'RE FITTING YOU
FOR A SUIT.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.248
(alert beeps,
radio chatter)

18:51.290 --> 18:53.599
(groans) I JUST WANTED
TODAY TO BE EASY, YOU KNOW?

18:53.630 --> 18:55.655
ONE SIMPLE LITTLE SHIFT.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.192
NO STOLEN BUSES,
NO BLIND WITNESSES.

18:59.230 --> 19:01.494
NO OLD PEOPLE CRYING ABOUT
THEIR MISSING WEDDING RINGS.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.939
WAIT, WHO'S CRYING ABOUT
THEIR MISSING WEDDING RING?

19:02.970 --> 19:04.460
I DON'T KNOW.
GAIL'S LADY.

19:04.510 --> 19:05.738
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE DRAMATIC, ALL RIGHT?

19:05.770 --> 19:06.839
I WAS MAKING A POINT.
(phone Vibrates)

19:06.870 --> 19:08.929
(Velcro tears)
(phone beeps)

19:08.980 --> 19:10.277
OLIVER?

19:10.310 --> 19:11.379
HANG ON.
WHERE ARE YOU?

19:11.410 --> 19:13.241
I AM--I'M BUSY.
I AM INVESTIGATING.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.340
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Nothing. Look.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.519
YOU DO REALIZE WE'RE GONNA
BE HERE ALL NIGHT.
(Archie) Too short. Too short.

19:18.550 --> 19:21.519
THEY NEED TO BREAK
ON THE HEEL.
BACK OFF, ARCHIE.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.913
Have I ever let you down?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.689
ONCE. THE GLEN PLAID
NUMBER.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.220
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.796
ALWAYS WITH THE GLEN PLAID.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.491
SORRY. WILIllI-IRE ARE YOU?

19:29.530 --> 19:30.929
(beeping)
I'M, UH...

19:30.970 --> 19:32.460
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BREAKING
UP ON ME NOW.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.797
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PHONE
YOU BACK.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.364
YOU ARE FIRED.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.368
GET THAT PHONE OUT OF
YOUR POCKET, OFFICER.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.799
IT RUINS THE LINE.
SORRY.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.434
NOW, WHAT CAR ARE YOU
DRIVING TONIGHT?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.402
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LITTLE
GEM OF A CAR

19:44.450 --> 19:46.304
THAT COULD REALLY
USE AN OUTING.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.443
GLEN PLAID.
IS THAT A ROAD?

19:48.480 --> 19:49.811
WEDDING RINGS.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.239
WHAT?
GRAHAM AND ELEANOR WARD.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.349
THEY DIDN'T LIST THEM IN THEIR
INVENTORY OF STOLEN ITEMS--

19:54.390 --> 19:57.382
WATCH, CUFFLINKS, $100
IN CASH, FAKE PEARLS.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.489
NO MENTION OF WEDDING RINGS.
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T TAKE THEM.

19:59.530 --> 20:02.522
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T
WEARING THEM.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.391
I'D REALLY LIKE TO TAKE
ELEANOR HOME.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.227
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.931
WE JUST WANTED TO CHECK.
YOU FOLKS ARE MARRIED, CORRECT?

20:07.970 --> 20:09.699
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
(chuckles)
YEAH. (chuckles)

20:09.740 --> 20:11.537
IT'S JUST YOU'RE NOT
WEARING WEDDING RINGS.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.538
SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THOSE WEREN'T STOLEN AS WELL.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.275
NO, IT'S PURE LUCK.

20:15.310 --> 20:18.302
GRAHAM--HE TOOK THEM TO BE
CLEANED A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.272
FUNNY HOW THE UNIVERSE
WORKS, ISN'T IT?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.538
CERTAINLY IS.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.548
ELEANOR, I'M GONNA TAKE
YOU BACK INTO THE LOUNGE

20:24.590 --> 20:25.818
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.408
WE'RE JUST GONNA SPEAK
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.258
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
GO AHEAD.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.594
SIR, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE?

20:34.630 --> 20:37.394
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT HAVE TO
DO THIS IN INTERVIEW.

20:37.430 --> 20:40.365
FOR WHAT?
GETTING OUR RINGS CLEANED?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.435
I'M SORRY, OFFICER.

20:41.470 --> 20:44.439
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.347
(indistinct conversations)

20:57.390 --> 20:59.745
THIS IS NOELLE'S OLD PLACE.
(keys jangle)

20:59.790 --> 21:02.816
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO SELL IT
SINCE SHE MOVED IN WITH FRANK.

21:02.860 --> 21:04.384
SHE GAVE YOU A KEY?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.284
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
SINGLE GIRLS DO, STEVE.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.957
THEY GIVE EACH OTHER
KEYS TO THEIR PLACE.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.695
THAT WAY,
IF YOU DIE ALONE...

21:09.730 --> 21:11.027
YOUR FRIEND CAN COME OVER,
GET YOU DRESSED

21:11.070 --> 21:12.697
AND HIDE YOUR PORN--
YEAH, I GET IT.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.834
(children playing
in distance)

21:14.870 --> 21:15.939
NOELLE?

21:15.970 --> 21:17.904
NOELLE, ARE YOU IN HERE?

21:19.970 --> 21:22.029
NASH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:22.080 --> 21:23.172
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

21:23.210 --> 21:26.338
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
GETTING MARRIED IN THREE HOURS.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.769
YEAH, WELL, UH,
HERE'S THE THING--

21:28.820 --> 21:30.014
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.081
HAVE YOU TOLD FRANK?

21:38.130 --> 21:41.327
NO. I'M GONNA CALL HIM
WHEN I GET SOMEWHERE.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.965
NAN'S GOT OLIVIA, SO SHE'LL
BE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.798
I JUST... NEED TO GET
MY HEAD TOGETHER.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.798
I JUST CAME HERE
TO GRAB SOME CLOTHES.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.068
NOELLE...

21:50.100 --> 21:51.863
HONEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:53.540 --> 21:55.633
I WENT TO ST. PAT'S
YESTERDAY.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.602
JUST A ROUTINE MAMMOGRAM.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.675
I DO IT EVERY YEAR.
FAMILY HISTORY.

22:01.050 --> 22:03.439
THEY FOUND A LUMP.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.017
BIOPSY'S NOT BACK YET,
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE...

22:07.050 --> 22:08.915
NOTHING KIND OF LUMP,

22:08.960 --> 22:11.952
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SOMETHING KIND OF LUMP.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.628
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.821
I KNOW THAT MY MOTHER
DIED OF BREAST CANCER.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.828
SHE WAS 43.
AND MY SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED

22:17.870 --> 22:19.895
6 YEARS AGO, AND SHE DIED
WHEN SHE WAS 37,

22:19.930 --> 22:23.434
SO I'VE KIND OF BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE,

22:23.470 --> 22:25.961
DREADING IT.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.774
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
HAPPEN THIS WEEK.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.108
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD FRANK?

22:32.510 --> 22:34.068
(sniffles)

22:34.120 --> 22:36.714
BECAUSE HE'D MARRY ME
ANYWAY.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.980
AND I DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT TO HIM.

22:39.020 --> 22:41.614
I MEAN, I ALREADY FEEL LIKE
I TRAPPED HIM

22:41.660 --> 22:43.480
BY GETTING PREGNANT.
I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM

22:43.530 --> 22:45.122
END UP WITH SOME
SICK WIFE TO LOOK AFTER, TOO.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.752
I'M JUST... I'M NOT.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.099
I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH
TO DO THAT TO HIM.
(zipper zips)

22:49.130 --> 22:50.961
NOELLE, I KNOW THIS MIGHT SEEM
ALL UNMANAGEABLE RIGHT NOW--

22:51.000 --> 22:53.025
LISTEN, I JUST NEED
SOME SPACE. I JUST...

22:53.070 --> 22:54.469
NEED TO GET
MY HEAD STRAIGHT.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.036
I'M... (sighs)
I GOTTA CALL A CAB.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.129
NO, NO. WE'LL--
WE'LL DRIVE YOU.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.432
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

22:59.470 --> 23:00.698
COME ON, WE'LL--

23:00.740 --> 23:01.934
WE'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:06.610 --> 23:07.770
SO WHERE WE GOING?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.515
ISLAND AIRPORT?
UNION STATION?

23:09.550 --> 23:11.814
I DON'T--
YEAH, YOU KNOW THE ISLAND
AIRPORT HAS A FLIGHT OUT

23:11.850 --> 23:13.715
EVERY SIX MINUTES--
CHICAGO, NEW YORK,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.978
MONTREAL, MYRTLE BEACH.
I GUESS I'LL DECIDE
WHEN I GET THERE.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.681
YOU KNOW, NEW YORK
WOULD BE COOL.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.618
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT
IT'S INSANELY EXPENSIVE.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.753
IT'S, LIKE, $500 A NIGHT
FOR A CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM

23:21.800 --> 23:23.119
THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD,
YOU KNOW.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.764
BUT, HEY, YOU MIGHT GET
TO SEE A MUSICAL.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.062
LIKE, UH, "CAGE AUX FOLLES"

23:26.100 --> 23:28.830
OR "SISTER ACT"
OR--OR "CATS."
I HATE MUSICALS.

23:28.870 --> 23:30.565
YEAH, ME, TOO. THAT'S WHY
I GO TO CHICAGO.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.907
IT'S JUST LIKE HERE
EXCEPT IT'S WINDIER.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.771
UH, YOU KNOW,
MONTREAL IS NICE,

23:33.810 --> 23:35.778
BUT UNLESS YOU SPEAK FRENCH,
IT'S KIND OF TRICKY

23:35.810 --> 23:37.744
TO NAVIGATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE FEELING FRAGILE.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.645
YOU KNOW, I KNOW. ITRIED.
I SPENT TWO WEEKS

23:39.680 --> 23:41.511
HIDING OUT THERE
AFTER MY LAST BREAKUP.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.211
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
I GAINED 10 POUNDS. 10 POUNDS.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.548
DRINKING BEER AND EATING
CROISSANTS, YOU KNOW?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.182
'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING
I COULD ORDER IN FRENCH.
IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?

23:47.220 --> 23:49.552
I-I'M AFRAID SO.
SO I KEPT ORDERING IT.
BUT I GUESS, YOU KNOW,

23:49.590 --> 23:50.750
IT DOESN'T MATTER, RIGHT?

23:50.790 --> 23:51.950
JUST AS LONG AS YOU'RE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

23:51.990 --> 23:53.855
SO WE'LL DROP YOU OFF
AT THE AIRPORT,

23:53.900 --> 23:56.721
THEN WE'LL GO BREAK THE NEWS
TO FRANK, OKAY?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.694
NOELLE, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO TELL ME

23:58.730 --> 24:00.766
WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO TELL HIM.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.199
HE'LL BE LEAVING IN AN HOUR.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.708
YOU CAN CATCH HIM BEFORE
HE GOES TO THE HOTEL.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.833
J-JUST DON'T TELL HIM
TO SIT DOWN.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.541
NO BUILDUP. HE HATES THAT.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.548
HE'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S UP
ANYWAY.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.618
AND THEN JUST--
JUST TELL HIM.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.888
JUST... TELL HIM...

24:21.620 --> 24:23.554
FIVE MINUTES UNTIL
WE HIT THE AIRPORT.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.218
(exhales) SCREW IT.

24:26.260 --> 24:27.750
TURN THE CAR AROUND.

24:29.730 --> 24:32.995
YOU'VE GOT A 73-YEAR-OLD
VICTIM OF A CRIME

24:33.030 --> 24:34.998
SITTING IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.632
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.001
WELL, IT ISN'T.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.598
WE TALKED TO JUNE HEATON.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.904
SHE INFORMED US THAT YOU
AND YOUR WIFE

24:41.940 --> 24:43.749
WERE BEHIND FOUR MONTHS
ON YOUR PAYMENTS.

24:43.780 --> 24:46.169
BEDFORD HOUSE
IS $10,000 A MONTH.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.768
I KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.242
WELL, SHE SAID SHE'S WORRIED.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.840
THAT SHE TOLD YOU THAT IF YOU
DON'T COME UP WITH THE FEES,

24:51.890 --> 24:55.257
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.
I'M NOT SURE I'D TRUST
JUNE'S MEMORY.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.258
SHE'S STRETCHED
A LITTLE THIN.

24:57.290 --> 24:58.826
SO HOW ARE YOU
GONNA PAY FOR IT?

24:58.860 --> 25:00.589
SOLD YOUR HOUSE
SIX YEARS AGO.

25:00.630 --> 25:01.892
YOU HAVE NO PENSION
TO SPEAK OF,

25:01.930 --> 25:04.694
AND YOU'RE WELL THROUGH
YOUR LINE OF CREDIT.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.994
WHAT YOU DO HAVE
IS A NEPHEW--

25:07.030 --> 25:08.588
JAM ESON WARD.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.699
33, HISTORY OF B&ES,
THEFT, FRAUD.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.134
(clicks tongue)
WELL, HE'S...

25:13.170 --> 25:14.569
WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION NOW.

25:14.610 --> 25:16.032
HE'S GOT A JOB
AT A CEMENT FACTORY

25:16.080 --> 25:18.048
DOWN AT THE DOCKS.
WE KNOW THAT.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.139
WE ACTUALLY CHECKED
YOUR CELL PHONE RECORDS.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.273
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM
QUITE A LOT THIS LAST MONTH.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.117
I MEAN, EVEN A COUPLE
PHONE CALLS TODAY.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.539
EXCEPT THOSE ONES
DIDN'T GET ANSWERED.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.685
(breathes sharply)

25:31.730 --> 25:33.288
DO I NEED A LAWYER?

25:33.330 --> 25:34.854
WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU
A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.788
IT'S JUST THAT'S GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME.

25:39.030 --> 25:43.865
MUST SEEM REALLY EASY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.799
WORK HARD, PAY YOUR TAXES.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.809
WHAT YOU CAN'T KNOW
IS THE HARD STUFF.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.707
WHEN YOU CAN'T WORK
ANYMORE,

25:52.750 --> 25:53.876
OR WHEN THE WOMAN...

25:55.720 --> 25:57.711
YOU'VE BEEN LOVING
FOR 40 YEARS

25:57.750 --> 26:00.218
NEEDS TREATMENT
YOU CAN'T PAY FOR.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.627
SEE, THAT'S THE TRICKY PART.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.059
THAT'S THE PART YOU...

26:06.090 --> 26:08.923
REALLY CAN'T PLAN FOR.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.635
(exhales sharply)

26:15.670 --> 26:18.662
WE WERE GONNA SPLIT
THE MONEY.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.701
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T
HURT ANYONE.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.332
(voice breaking)
DOES ELEANOR KNOW?

26:22.380 --> 26:24.177
NO.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.144
WE THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
LIKE TO TELL HER YOURSELF.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.841
(chuckles)

26:27.880 --> 26:29.768
WELL, THEN, OFFICER,

26:29.820 --> 26:31.788
YOU MUST NOT BE MARRIED.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.911
JUST TELL HIM TO TAKE IT EASY
WITH THE CLUTCH.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.053
IT'S A '62,
SO IT SHOULD BE FINE,

26:39.090 --> 26:40.853
BUT IT IS A DELICATE ANIMAL.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.652
WILL DO. AND, ARCHIE,

26:42.700 --> 26:44.167
THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.167
OH, THANK YOU, OFFICER.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.758
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW NICE IT IS

26:46.800 --> 26:47.994
TO FEEL RELEVANT.
(chuckles)

26:48.040 --> 26:49.769
OKAY, FOLKS,
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.301
TRANSPORTATION'S
BEEN ARRANGED,

26:51.340 --> 26:53.103
AND THERE'S CARS FOR YOU
WAITING OUTSIDE.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.835
THAT'S GREAT.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.007
SO, I, UH, I GUESS YOU KNOW
WHO DID IT, HUH?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.406
OF COURSE THEY KNOW
WHO DID IT.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.974
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GOING HOME.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.989
I'M JUST ASKING.
UHH... (sighs)

27:08.260 --> 27:09.887
WHAT?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.229
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO BE THIS CYNICAL.

27:12.260 --> 27:15.297
FIND A FRIEND. HAVE A LITTLE
FUN ONCE IN A WHILE.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.890
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE WALTER?
YOU TWO HATE EACH OTHER.

27:17.930 --> 27:22.333
(chuckles) I DON'T HATE HIM.
HE'S MY PLUS-ONE.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.235
TRUST ME, SWEETHEART,

27:24.270 --> 27:26.966
LIFE'S WAY TOO LONG
TO GO THROUGH IT ALONE.

27:35.350 --> 27:38.285
(man shouting in distance,
radio chatter)

27:40.920 --> 27:42.410
EXCUSE ME?

27:42.460 --> 27:44.018
YEAH?

27:44.060 --> 27:45.425
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A JAMESON WARD.
JAMIE?

27:45.460 --> 27:47.223
JAMIE, JAMESON--YEAH.
EITHER WORKS.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.852
UH, JAMIE'S UP THERE.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.788
HE'S SPOT WELDING
A STRAP HINGE.
OF COURSE HE IS.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.695
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T BRING HIM
DOWN TILL HE'S DONE.

27:52.730 --> 27:55.290
HE'S MY ONLY WELDER ON TONIGHT.
I GOTTA GET THAT THING FIXED.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.967
IT'S A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.
OKAY.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.309
WELL, IS THERE
ANY OTHEIlNé/JVAY DOWN?

27:59.340 --> 28:00.898
(man shouting in distance)

28:00.940 --> 28:02.407
OKAY, WE'LL WAIT.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.873
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET YOU
KNOW WHEN HE COMES DOWN.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.047
THANK YOU.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.968
(man speaking over radio
indistinctly)

28:07.010 --> 28:08.875
(groans) FINE.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.047
CANCEL MY HAIR APPOINTMENT.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.162
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

29:41.580 --> 29:43.036
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

29:43.080 --> 29:44.877
OH, HOLD ON. UM...

29:55.490 --> 29:58.186
WE BROKE UP

29:58.230 --> 29:59.822
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:11.170 --> 30:14.105
(indistinct conversations)

30:21.550 --> 30:23.541

I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING
AT THE BAR.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.184
COAT CHECK GIRL
HASN'T SHOWN UP.

30:25.220 --> 30:26.585

30:26.620 --> 30:28.952

I HATE THESE THINGS.

30:46.510 --> 30:47.977
EVERYONE'S MILLING AROUND.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.375
I MEAN, THEY'RE LAUGHING
AND THEY'RE CARING.

30:49.410 --> 30:52.072

31:19.240 --> 31:21.208
SHE--SHE'S NOT HERE YET?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.538
SHE DISAPPEARED.
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.
WHAT? WHAT?

31:23.580 --> 31:26.344
D-DON'T TELL FRANK.
HE DOESN'T KNOW. SHH.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.541
(claps hands)
HEY. OKAY.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.980
SO, WHERE'S MY BEAUTIFUL
FIANCE?

31:34.520 --> 31:38.081
SHE'S... NOT FEELING WELL.
I THINK SHE'S ON HER WAY

31:38.130 --> 31:40.052

31:42.260 --> 31:44.262

31:49.300 --> 31:51.404
YOUR GODDAUGHTER,
YOUR BRIDESMAID,

31:51.440 --> 31:52.998
AND, YES, MY COLLEAGUE.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.701
BUT THE THING IS,
IT STARTED BEFORE SHE DID.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.605
I MEAN, B-B-BEFORE
SHE STARTED AT 15,

31:56.640 --> 31:58.176
NOT BEFORE SHE STARTED
TO EXIST--

31:58.210 --> 32:00.041
FRANK. FRANK.
STAFF--

32:00.080 --> 32:03.208
SIR. UH, NOELLE'S HERE.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.389
SHE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.080
(sighs)

32:11.130 --> 32:12.324
YEAH.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.954
SO, WHAT? WE DON'T GET
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.353
FRANK, PLEASE.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.220
I HAVE BEEN WHERE YOU ARE
WITH MY OWN FAMILY.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.966
THERE IS NO WAY
TO PREPARE FOR THIS.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.262
IT'S JUST BETTER THIS WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

32:22.300 --> 32:24.962
AT LEAST, LIKE, UNTIL
I CAN FIGURE OUT--
WH--BETTER FOR WHO?

32:25.010 --> 32:27.331
ME? OLIVIA? YOU?

32:27.370 --> 32:32.103
LOOK, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
WE WILL GET THROUGH IT.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.401
YOU AND ME.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.475
SAME AS IT--IT
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.613
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER?

32:37.650 --> 32:40.118
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

32:40.150 --> 32:41.754
THEN I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TRY HARDER

32:41.790 --> 32:43.758
TO SHAKE ME LOOSE.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.189
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
WALK AWAY FROM US

32:45.230 --> 32:47.084
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
THAT MAY

32:47.130 --> 32:48.688
OR MAY NOT HAPPEN, BABY.

32:48.730 --> 32:51.324
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD
WANT TO BE HERE FOR.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.565
(exhales)
LISTEN TO ME. SWEETHEART.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.292
BABY, IT'S JUST ME.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.635
IT'S JUST ME.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.534
ALL RIGHT.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.518
(exhales)
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.348
I'M SORRY.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.618
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.753
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

33:18.790 --> 33:20.451
I KNOW YOU REALLY
WANTED TO BE THERE.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.355
IT'S FINE.
NAH.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.628
NOT REALLY.
(beeps)

33:23.660 --> 33:27.221
(phone rings)

33:27.270 --> 33:28.589
(beeps)
(laughing)

33:28.640 --> 33:30.494
Hey, Dov?
(lowered voice)
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

33:30.540 --> 33:32.508
WE'RE WORKING. YOU?

33:32.540 --> 33:33.768
UH, JUST WAITING
FOR THE BRIDE TO SHOW UP,

33:33.810 --> 33:35.573
BUT I GOTTA GO.
IT'S GONNA START SOON.

33:35.610 --> 33:38.499
UH, HEY, HEY, UH...
YOU GOT SPEAKERPHONE?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.404
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
COME ON.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.077
WE'LL PUT OUR END ON MUTE.
WE JUST WANT TO LISTEN.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.371
YEAH, SURE.
I GUESS IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.785
(chuckles)
(phone beeps)

33:44.820 --> 33:46.685
(laughing) SORRY.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.312
(Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"
from "Lohengrin" playing)

33:48.360 --> 33:50.316
THERE IT IS.
THAT'S THE RIFF.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.452
SHE'S COMING IN.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.425

33:57.400 --> 33:59.789
(Noelle chuckles)

34:06.440 --> 34:09.500
(music continues
over speakerphone)

34:09.540 --> 34:12.304
**

34:14.550 --> 34:16.142
(music ends)

34:16.180 --> 34:17.579
DEARLY BELOVED,

34:17.620 --> 34:20.418
WE ARE GATHERED HERE
TOGETHER TODAY TO JOIN FRANK

34:20.450 --> 34:22.589
and Noelle
in holy matrimony.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.121
I ACTUALLY WISH
WE WERE THERE.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.650
ME, TOO.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.658
THERE'S NOWHERE I'D RATHER
BE THAN HERE, THOUGH.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.250
JUST...

34:30.300 --> 34:33.292
YOU AND ME SITTING HERE,
DOING WHAT WE DO.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.105
I, Franklin Joseph Best,

34:38.140 --> 34:41.530
TAKE YOU,
NOELLE GRACE WILLIAMS,

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,

34:45.880 --> 34:49.372
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

34:49.420 --> 34:51.183
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,

34:51.220 --> 34:54.280
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH,

34:54.320 --> 34:57.517
TO LOVE AND CHERISH,

34:57.560 --> 34:59.778
till death do us part.

34:59.830 --> 35:01.798
(sniffles and laughs)

35:01.830 --> 35:03.149
(minister) Noelle?
OH...

35:03.200 --> 35:05.259
IT GETS ME EVERY TIME.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.790
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.798
YOU KNOW? I KNOW THE WORDS
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.796
BUT SOMEHOW...

35:10.840 --> 35:12.660
I DON'T KNOW, THEY JUST
GET MORE MAGICAL,

35:12.710 --> 35:14.678
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
I HEAR THEM.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.133
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU.

35:17.180 --> 35:19.501
WHAT, THAT MY WORDS GET
MORE MAGICAL? (chuckles)

35:19.550 --> 35:20.676
NO.

35:20.710 --> 35:21.847
YOU DO.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.711
(Noelle)
...to love and cherish...

35:23.750 --> 35:25.240
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

35:25.290 --> 35:26.814
till death do us part.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.215
NO, I JUST--

35:30.420 --> 35:32.149
YEAH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.159
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
JAMIE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN.
THANK YOU.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.395
(radio chatter)

35:37.430 --> 35:39.762
JAMESON WARD?
I'M OFFICER MCNALLY.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.438
THIS IS OFFICER COLLINS.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.290
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE YOU
WERE THIS MORNING,

35:43.340 --> 35:45.308
APPROXIMATELY 10:30 A.M.?
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:45.340 --> 35:46.830
WELL, THERE WAS A BUS ROBBERY
AT THAT TIME.

35:46.870 --> 35:47.905
WE GOT REASON TO BELIEVE--
NO. JUST--

35:47.940 --> 35:49.908
WE JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.374
COME ON, COME BACK DOWN HERE!

35:52.410 --> 35:54.878
(sighs) JAMESON WARD,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

35:54.920 --> 35:58.219
FOR... EVADING ARREST.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.842
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
I DON'T KNOW.

35:59.890 --> 36:01.915
(stammers)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:01.960 --> 36:04.383
I MEAN, WHERE'S HE
GONNA GO, RIGHT?

36:04.430 --> 36:06.523
DO YOU WANNA GO AFTER HIM?
'CAUSE I'M GAME IF YOU WANT TO.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.357
NO. WHAT'S THE POINT?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.958
THERE'S NO RUSH.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.058
(reverse signal beeping,
radio static)

36:11.100 --> 36:14.365
1504, WE GOT EYES ON
THE SUSPECT IN THE BUS ROBBERY.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.391
HE'S, UH...

36:16.440 --> 36:17.930
HE'S CLIMBED 70 FEET
UP THE TOWER.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.506
WE COULD USE A LITTLE
BACKUP.
(radio static)

36:19.540 --> 36:22.179
(woman) Copy, 1504.
(radio static)

36:29.750 --> 36:31.411
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

36:31.450 --> 36:33.509
I DON'T KNOW.

36:33.550 --> 36:35.211
(scoffs)

36:35.260 --> 36:37.319
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

36:38.990 --> 36:41.185
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.268
I GUESS THAT'S UP TO YOU.

36:46.630 --> 36:49.428
(breathes sharply)

37:10.060 --> 37:12.483
(laughter)
AH! IT'S THE FIRST DANCE!

37:12.530 --> 37:14.498

37:14.530 --> 37:16.589

(laughter)
OH-HO-HO! OH!

37:31.750 --> 37:33.377
I'M GONNA GET ANOTHER DRINK.
DO YOU WANT ONE?

37:33.410 --> 37:34.946
YEAH, PLEASE.

37:34.980 --> 37:38.279
* AND I WILL NEVER,
EVER QUIT LOVING YOU *

37:38.320 --> 37:39.617
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

37:39.650 --> 37:41.311
WE HAVEN'T CONSUMMATED
THE UNION.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.282
YOU COULD RUN OUT THE DOOR,
ANNUL THE MARRIAGE.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.356
THEN LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.584
WHAT?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.493
CONSUMMATE THE UNION.

37:49.530 --> 37:50.724
(both laugh)

37:50.760 --> 37:52.921
MAYBE WE SHOULD FINISH
THE SONG.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.689
I THINK WE'D HAVE
A GOOD TIME, THOUGH.
(laughing)
I THINK SO, TOO.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.367
COME JOIN US.
PLEASE.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.833
GET OUT THERE.

37:58.870 --> 38:00.565
WANNA GO OUT THERE?
I DON'T REALLY
CARE TO DANCE.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.077
AH, COME ON, YOU NEED IT.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.889
**

38:21.460 --> 38:22.825
HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.418
I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT.
I'M JUST GONNA--

38:24.470 --> 38:25.823
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT.
WHAT?

38:25.870 --> 38:28.088
UM... WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

38:28.130 --> 38:29.995
MM...

38:30.040 --> 38:32.964
I JUST THINK YOU HAVE
SOME THINGS TO FIGURE OUT,

38:35.510 --> 38:37.000
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB A CAB.
I'M JUST--

38:37.040 --> 38:38.371
NO HARD FEELINGS.
NO, NO, NO--

38:38.410 --> 38:40.378
NO HARD FEELINGS,
BUT I DON'T.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.718
I HAVE NOTHING TO FIGURE OUT.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.843
THE--THE ONLY THING
THAT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

38:43.880 --> 38:46.110
IS HOW I GET THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THIS ROOM

38:46.150 --> 38:47.947
TO DANCE WITH ME.
(chuckles)

38:47.990 --> 38:49.810
YOU KNOW, I--
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.589
A GOOD, LONG WHILE,
BUT I DANCE ALL THE TIME

38:51.630 --> 38:53.552
WITH MY GIRLS, AND I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,

38:53.590 --> 38:56.491
BUT ONE DIRECT ION--THEY JUST
DROPPED A NEW RECORD,

38:56.530 --> 38:58.828
AND I KNOW IT
BACK TO FRONT.
(laughs)

38:58.870 --> 39:01.361
YES.
YES!

39:01.400 --> 39:02.560
WE'RE GONNA DANCE!
(laughs)

39:02.600 --> 39:06.900
**

39:06.940 --> 39:08.601
MMM!

39:08.640 --> 39:10.870
(mouth full) OH, MY GOD!
YOU GOTTA TRY THIS.

39:10.910 --> 39:13.902
WHAT IS IT?
SOME KIND OF CAKE LOLLIPOP.
IT'S AMAZING.

39:13.950 --> 39:15.918
(smacks lips)
TRY IT.

39:17.150 --> 39:18.481
SO? HUH?

39:18.520 --> 39:19.919
(mouth full) KEEP 'EM COMING.
THAT'S GOOD.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.815
KEEP 'EM COMING!
OH, YES. (laughing)
THAT'S GOOD.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.885
MM-HMM. (laughing)
THERE YOU GO.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.457
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART
ABOUT TONIGHT?
YOUR OUTFIT.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.993
MAID OF HONOR IN RUNNING SHOES.
I KNOW. CLASSIC.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.169
YOU DID GOOD.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.929
SO DID YOU.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.602
UM, SO WHAT WAS
THE BEST PART ABOUT TONIGHT?

39:38.640 --> 39:39.959
HMM?
THE HEART-SHAPED BROWNIES.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.807
WHERE?
COVERED IN GOLD LEAF.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.478
THEY'VE BEEN COMING BY
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

39:43.510 --> 39:44.772
THERE SHE IS.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.846
MMM.
(laughs)

39:48.010 --> 39:49.716
DON'T MOVE. STAY HERE.

39:49.750 --> 39:51.684
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.518
("Dancing With Your Ghost"
Playing)

39:54.560 --> 39:56.187
(Holly laughing)

39:56.220 --> 39:58.529
UM...

39:58.560 --> 40:01.950
SO IS IT STILL FUN
GETTING DRESSED?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.524
(laughs)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:03.560 --> 40:05.528
WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S
THE MOST FUN PART OF A DATE,

40:05.570 --> 40:07.026
IS GETTING DRESSED.
I MEAN, HOW DOES IT WORK

40:07.070 --> 40:08.628
IF TWO GIRLS ARE GETTING
DRESSED TOGETHER?

40:08.670 --> 40:10.865
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DOES IT WORK WITH A GUY?

40:10.900 --> 40:12.902
I MEAN, IF YOU LIVE TOGETHER,
HE GETS DRESSED FIRST,

40:12.940 --> 40:15.534
AND THEN YOU GET...
DRESSED.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.831
IT'S VERY STUPID.
STUPID QUESTION.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.609
(Chuckles)

40:18.650 --> 40:20.049
WHAT ABOUT...

40:20.080 --> 40:22.139
IF YOU WANT TO BORROW
A DRESS

40:22.180 --> 40:24.489
OR SHOES OR CLOTHES?

40:24.520 --> 40:27.148
I MEAN, IS THAT COOL? DO YOU
SHARE EACH OTHER'S THINGS?

40:27.190 --> 40:28.851
I WOULDN'T SHARE
YOUR THINGS.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.084
WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY THINGS?

40:30.120 --> 40:32.122
NOTHING. THEY'RE JUST
NOT MY STYLE.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.425
OH, NOT ENOUGH FLEECE FOR YOU,
HOLLY? NOT ENOUGH BACKPACKS?

40:39.670 --> 40:40.989
YOU ARE INSANE.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.861
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

40:42.900 --> 40:44.936
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS WITH ME,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.631
PLENTY MORE OUT THERE.

40:47.910 --> 40:50.105
SORRY. WH--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:50.140 --> 40:51.744
DANCING.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.099
I KINDA NEED
TO GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.618
THANKS. THAT WAS FUN.

40:55.650 --> 40:56.969
PLUS-ONE FOREVER.

40:57.020 --> 40:58.169
* ALL OF THE FACES

40:58.220 --> 41:01.849
* OF THE OTHER PEOPLE
STARING BACK AT ME *

41:01.890 --> 41:04.688
THANK YOU, PAL.
HELP YOURSELF.
NICE SUIT.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.550
OH...
ONE MORE, PLEASE.

41:06.590 --> 41:07.625
THAN KS, MAN.

41:07.660 --> 41:09.890
