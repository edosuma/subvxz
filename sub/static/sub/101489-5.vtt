14:33.674 --> 14:35.676
Making me say it

14:35.709 --> 14:38.478
instead of you isn't gonna make
doing it any easier.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.524
Plenty of people are bad
at English.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.393
Yeah, but they're not proud
of it.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.329
This problem you got‐‐
it's a math problem.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.532
Either you divide them,

14:58.565 --> 15:01.935
or they multiply.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.970
Capisce?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.341
I got to piss.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.285
Be ready.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.990
When the shooting starts,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.560
we vanish.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.419
(indistinct whispering)

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
(clattering)

16:05.065 --> 16:07.067
(whispers):
It's the niece.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.679
Show her the whistle.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.581
(whistles two notes)

16:20.614 --> 16:22.749
So we know
you're friendly next time.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.751
Hey, you got any food on you?

16:24.785 --> 16:27.153
There's too much heat
in the street to go out,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.355
and we ate all the saltines
last night.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.392
(sighs)
I got some pretzels in my bag.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.797
You want a drink?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.431
We're drinking.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.300
No, ma'am.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.769
Come on now. It's your birthday.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.705
You're grown.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.073
(laughs)
What, you thought I forgot?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.576
Shit, I wish I could be
with y'all to celebrate,

16:49.610 --> 16:51.144
eat me some cake.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.780
‐Cake?
‐But this gonna have to do.

16:53.814 --> 16:56.583
Oh, well,
liquor clouds the mind.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.251
That's what I'm counting on.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.353
(Ethelrida laughs)

17:03.189 --> 17:05.157
To my beautiful niece

17:05.191 --> 17:07.594
and another twirl
around the sun.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.029
I'll slurp to that.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.035
‐(Swanee exhales)
‐(Zelmare clears throat)

17:16.737 --> 17:18.338
Aunt Zelmare,

17:18.371 --> 17:21.307
what would you do
if you saw something wrong?

17:21.340 --> 17:23.710
Something you could fix?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.712
Nothing.

17:25.746 --> 17:27.513
What do you mean?

17:27.548 --> 17:29.750
I mean nothing.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.585
'Cause you're a criminal?

17:31.618 --> 17:33.353
I ain't a criminal.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.856
You're innocent you're saying?

17:35.889 --> 17:38.324
Girl, I ain't been innocent
since Uncle Charlie cornered me

17:38.358 --> 17:40.093
in the shed when I was nine.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.496
Then I don't understand.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.297
SWANEE:
She's saying we ain't criminals.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.132
We're outlaws.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.434
See, criminals play the game.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.103
What game?

17:50.136 --> 17:51.772
Life. The earth.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.473
ZELMARE:
Society, right?

17:53.507 --> 17:54.808
They got their rules.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.343
Banking and family.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.614
An honest dollar
for an honest day's work.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.849
Politics and voting.

18:02.883 --> 18:05.351
And the criminal‐‐
he on the other side of that,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.253
but still he play the game.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.822
And if he plays it long enough,

18:08.855 --> 18:11.224
he even starts
to talk about going legit.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.659
The outlaw, on the other hand...

18:12.693 --> 18:14.327
The outlaw,
on the other hand‐‐

18:14.360 --> 18:18.231
well, we reject the game.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.366
Society.

18:21.702 --> 18:24.370
Ain't nothing organized
about our crime,

18:24.404 --> 18:27.674
'cause our crime is freedom.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.475
No rules.

18:29.510 --> 18:31.277
ZELMARE:
And nothing's ever broke,

18:31.311 --> 18:34.280
and there ain't nothing to fix.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.850
All we want is to live
while we're alive

18:36.883 --> 18:40.554
and... die with a gun
in our hands.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.625
You a bit of an outlaw.

18:44.658 --> 18:46.326
‐Me?
‐Yeah.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.428
Your mama sees it, too.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.697
In the eyes.

18:50.731 --> 18:52.365
That's why she say, "Keep away."

18:52.398 --> 18:55.235
I'm not an outlaw.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.937
Then, which are you‐‐

18:56.970 --> 18:59.239
a convict or a square?

18:59.272 --> 19:02.308
I'm not either one
of those things.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.777
What are you, then?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.317
I'm Ethelrida Pearl Smutny.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.321
One of a kind.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.501
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐What?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.637
What's wrong with her?

19:31.905 --> 19:33.674
Where you off to?

19:33.707 --> 19:35.441
They arrested your son.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.210
I know. I'm handling it.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.712
The same way
you're handling your other son,

19:38.745 --> 19:40.280
lives in an attic
with an Irishman?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.882
Come on now.
We talked about that.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.318
We did, and there he is, eating
someone else's food still.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.687
NARCISSA:
Mm‐hmm.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.589
Doc's gonna bail the boy out
this morning.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.525
He got his bell rung
pretty good, but he's all right.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.227
I'll get him.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.696
He's not the only boy
I got in there.

19:55.729 --> 19:56.963
They all need bailing out.

19:56.997 --> 19:59.633
Now, Doc's gonna sort it.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.735
You best get out of my way.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.837
NARCISSA:
Mm‐hmm.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.871
You got something to say to me?

20:04.905 --> 20:06.439
Don't you take this out on Mama.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.241
You ain't going down there.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.776
Loy Cannon,
you know better than to come

20:09.810 --> 20:11.645
between a mother and her child.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.914
‐I'm handling it.
‐Oh. You handling it.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.316
Well, send a letter to the pope.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.718
You hear that, Mama?

20:17.751 --> 20:19.385
‐Daddy's handling it.
‐Mm‐hmm.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.255
I got two baby girls
upstairs sleeping.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.990
You're gonna handle them, too?

20:24.024 --> 20:26.627
Maybe into the hospital
or the cemetery?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.461
Pretty soon,
all we're gonna have around here

20:28.495 --> 20:30.631
is a house full of clothes.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.666
I said I'm...

20:32.699 --> 20:34.801
You like that coat you wearing?

20:34.835 --> 20:37.604
The food you're eating?

20:37.638 --> 20:40.006
How about you, Your Majesty?

20:40.040 --> 20:42.509
You like the view
from your room?

20:42.543 --> 20:44.745
Your fancy blankets?

20:44.778 --> 20:46.847
Where do you think
all that comes from?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.353
The razor's edge.

20:53.386 --> 20:57.758
What, we're supposed to get rich
and stay rich, how?

20:57.791 --> 20:59.760
By saying our prayers?!

21:01.695 --> 21:04.765
The boy went to the club,
and the bulls lit him up.

21:04.798 --> 21:08.969
You act like that can't happen
just walking down the street.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.538
Acting like I'm the villain,

21:11.572 --> 21:14.374
when all I do is fight
for this family.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.044
You don't like how it's going?

21:18.078 --> 21:20.346
You're scared to take the risk?

21:21.414 --> 21:22.683
Too bad.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.450
We're on the ride now,

21:24.484 --> 21:28.088
and we can't get off
till the roller coaster stops.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.856
Now take off your damn coat

21:29.890 --> 21:32.793
and get me some fucking coffee!

21:54.114 --> 21:56.717
Can I get a "Mm‐hmm"?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.585
Hmm.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.456
OMIE:
Pong.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.327
OPAL:
Ping.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.065
OMIE:
Pong.

22:14.635 --> 22:16.670
OPAL:
Ping.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.473
Pong.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.708
(spits)

22:21.742 --> 22:24.377
My mouth tastes like metal.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.746
OPAL:
Ping.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.848
OMIE:
The law loosed your fillings.

22:27.881 --> 22:29.049
It's your own teeth
you're tasting.

22:29.082 --> 22:32.018
Pong.

22:32.052 --> 22:34.454
I know what it looks like.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.622
Ping.

22:35.656 --> 22:38.158
Is this prison or jail?

22:38.191 --> 22:40.727
Kid got his bell rung
pretty good.

22:40.761 --> 22:43.597
Nah, he just never been
in the clink before.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.866
Thanks to Pong over here.

22:45.899 --> 22:47.934
Wearing grooves.

22:47.968 --> 22:50.136
I moved him out the back
as soon as I saw 'em.

22:50.170 --> 22:52.072
We was outnumbered.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.473
That's good.

22:53.507 --> 22:55.141
Tell the boss that.

22:55.175 --> 22:57.911
"'We was outnumbered'
is why your oldest

22:57.944 --> 23:00.446
is looking at a decade stretch
on a chain gang."

23:01.848 --> 23:03.884
You hear music?

23:03.917 --> 23:05.151
Ask the boy.

23:05.185 --> 23:06.753
Ask him.

23:06.787 --> 23:08.789
Leon fought‐‐ he fought hard.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.991
OPAL:
He shouldn't have
been out there at all.

23:12.693 --> 23:15.161
Boss's son.

23:15.195 --> 23:16.963
Underage.

23:16.997 --> 23:20.734
Neck deep in liquor
and syphilis.

23:22.603 --> 23:24.771
I'm fucked.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.408
May as well bite my own throat.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.047
(keys jingling)

23:34.080 --> 23:35.181
(lock clicks)

23:35.215 --> 23:37.651
(gate slides open)

24:05.512 --> 24:07.514
(chuckles)

24:27.000 --> 24:29.469
♪ ♪

24:45.686 --> 24:48.021
Back in a box, huh?

24:49.890 --> 24:51.124
Open the gate.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.259
We'll see who ends up in a box.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.931
You know why America
loves a crime story?

24:57.964 --> 25:00.867
Because America
is a crime story.

25:00.901 --> 25:03.003
But here's the rub.

25:03.036 --> 25:06.607
When we hear a crime story,
who do we root for?

25:06.640 --> 25:10.076
Not the poor sap that got taken.

25:10.110 --> 25:11.878
The victim, no.

25:11.912 --> 25:14.615
We root for the taker.

25:14.648 --> 25:17.283
The guy with the gat.

25:17.317 --> 25:19.185
(imitating machine gun)

25:25.726 --> 25:28.228
See, this country loves a man

25:28.261 --> 25:31.297
who takes what he wants.

25:31.331 --> 25:33.867
Unless...

25:35.802 --> 25:38.038
(whispers):
Unless that man looks like you.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.846
Capisce?

25:45.879 --> 25:48.314
See, Johnny Society looks at me,

25:48.348 --> 25:51.952
they see a fella
that's using crime to get ahead.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.354
But you?

25:54.387 --> 25:57.323
All they see is crime.

25:57.357 --> 26:00.961
And that's why
you're gonna lose.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.797
'Cause I can take all the money

26:03.830 --> 26:06.199
and pussy I want

26:06.232 --> 26:09.670
and still run for president.

26:09.703 --> 26:11.304
But you?

26:12.973 --> 26:15.676
It's always gonna be the rope.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.213
Tell him it's time to surrender.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.396
What's he gonna do?

26:36.429 --> 26:38.865
Loy.

26:38.899 --> 26:41.835
Man, go fuck yourself.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.403
MILLIGAN:
We don't have time for that.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.138
This is about his boy.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.240
What's the man gonna do?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.142
Settle or war?

26:49.175 --> 26:50.611
The devil lives in the past.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.881
Ain't no going back
to the way it was.

26:58.151 --> 27:00.887
Tell him I'll keep the boy safe.

27:00.921 --> 27:02.989
No matter what.

27:03.023 --> 27:05.158
OPAL:
You just bring him back home.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.128
‐We'll watch him.
‐No.

27:08.161 --> 27:10.631
You're all gonna die.

27:34.888 --> 27:36.422
(knocking)

27:36.456 --> 27:38.124
Buzz off.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.394
DEAFY:
It's me, Palomino. Open up.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.963
(exhales)

27:49.803 --> 27:52.138
(knocking and grunting
rhythmically)

27:56.977 --> 27:58.178
Rough night?

27:58.211 --> 28:01.181
(exhales)
They're all rough.

28:01.214 --> 28:03.283
Big raid, I heard.

28:03.316 --> 28:04.885
Taking down some real bad guys.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.920
You should've called.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.022
Not your case.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.057
Sure, but you and me‐‐
we're partners.

28:11.091 --> 28:14.427
So, anything you need.
¿Comprendo?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.362
We're not partners.

28:16.396 --> 28:17.964
Hey.

28:17.998 --> 28:20.000
Hey, that's private.

28:23.103 --> 28:24.304
Guessing the story
didn't end well

28:24.337 --> 28:26.439
for the girl in the picture.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.441
No, she died.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.943
Wife?

28:30.977 --> 28:32.312
Intended.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.247
While I was overseas.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.082
Criminy.

28:36.116 --> 28:37.483
How'd she go?

28:37.518 --> 28:39.052
What?

28:39.085 --> 28:41.454
I said "How did she go?"

28:41.487 --> 28:44.024
If you don't mind me asking.
(sniffles)

28:46.159 --> 28:48.995
Nelson Beets.

28:49.029 --> 28:50.864
Broke in while she was sleeping.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.066
Raped her, strangled her
with her own panties.

28:54.267 --> 28:55.836
(Odis sighs)

29:01.908 --> 29:03.409
I got the letter
while I was in France.

29:03.443 --> 29:04.845
(liquid pouring)

29:04.878 --> 29:06.112
(sets bottle down)

29:06.146 --> 29:08.114
Well, they had me clearing
land mines...

29:08.148 --> 29:10.884
on account I'm real precise.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.087
Get a system, never vary.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.890

one morning.

29:23.564 --> 29:27.033
Went out to clear a field.

29:27.067 --> 29:29.402
Just laid down
right there in the grass.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.808
Must've been there
three, four hours.

29:40.914 --> 29:42.883
You know, I swear...

29:42.916 --> 29:45.151
the clouds look different
over there.

29:45.185 --> 29:47.521
Different how?

29:50.190 --> 29:52.158
I don't know. French, I guess.

29:57.598 --> 30:00.133
What was her name?

30:01.334 --> 30:03.303
Was there something you needed?

30:03.336 --> 30:06.172
No. Just, uh...

30:06.206 --> 30:09.042
I had a vision
last night is all,

30:09.075 --> 30:11.144
while I was saying my prayers.

30:12.345 --> 30:14.280
"Shake the tree," said the Lord.

30:14.314 --> 30:17.050
"And your suspects shall fall
like sweet, ripe fruit."

30:17.083 --> 30:18.585
So that's what I'm gonna do.

30:18.619 --> 30:20.887
Thought you might want
to shake it with me.

30:20.921 --> 30:22.322
I got to...

30:22.355 --> 30:25.191
There's a lot of paperwork.
Big raid, you know?

30:25.225 --> 30:27.027
Captain said, "Stick with Odis.
He'll be your guide."

30:27.060 --> 30:29.563
Yeah, but you been here,
what, 25 years now?

30:29.596 --> 30:32.232

45:15.248 --> 45:16.883
Ready to work?

45:16.917 --> 45:18.885
Yes, sir.

45:18.919 --> 45:20.220
We leave in five.

45:20.253 --> 45:21.922
Arm up.

45:28.161 --> 45:29.830
Calling all cars.

45:29.863 --> 45:32.833
Suspect fugitives are holed up
at the New Parie Hotel.

45:32.866 --> 45:34.768
I am inbound, requesting backup.

45:34.801 --> 45:36.002
DISPATCHER:
Roger that.

45:36.036 --> 45:38.004
(laughs)

45:38.038 --> 45:41.341
I could get used to this.

45:41.374 --> 45:46.012
What, masticating savory vittles
and imbibing top‐shelf hooch?

45:46.046 --> 45:47.347
Hoo‐wee!

45:47.380 --> 45:50.083
Someone's been studying
their vocabulary.

45:50.116 --> 45:53.486
I am trying to be punctilious
with my locution.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.022
Girl, I don't know
what you just said,

45:56.056 --> 45:58.024
but I like the way it sound.

45:58.058 --> 45:59.960
(both laughing)

46:02.596 --> 46:04.130
(Zelmare and Swanee gasp)

46:04.164 --> 46:05.398
OPAL:
Hands.

46:05.431 --> 46:07.501
Ladies.

46:10.003 --> 46:12.072
Cover yourselves up.

46:12.105 --> 46:13.439
Never mind that.

46:13.473 --> 46:15.909
Let's get this over with.

46:15.942 --> 46:17.878
‐LOY: You're the puker?
‐(clicks tongue)

46:17.911 --> 46:19.245
So you must be the shooter.

46:19.279 --> 46:20.947
Give me my gun,
and I'll show you.

46:20.981 --> 46:22.282
LOY:
They got spirit.

46:22.315 --> 46:25.886
God help me,
I love a girl with spirit.

46:25.919 --> 46:27.320
Get dressed.

46:29.289 --> 46:31.457
(tires squealing)

46:31.491 --> 46:33.259
(car door closes)

46:33.293 --> 46:35.128
SWANEE:
Mister,

46:35.161 --> 46:37.230
either rape us
or kill us already.

46:38.398 --> 46:40.867
LOY:
Dying's too easy.

46:40.901 --> 46:43.937
You owe me,
and I'm putting you to work.

46:43.970 --> 46:46.072
‐We ain't whores.
‐Don't need whores.

46:46.106 --> 46:48.308
Need soldiers,
invisible soldiers.

46:48.341 --> 46:51.211
Soldiers the other side
can't see coming.

46:51.244 --> 46:53.614
Who's more invisible than you?

46:53.647 --> 46:55.281
DEAFY:
Which room

46:55.315 --> 46:57.984
are the two jailbirds in‐‐
the Negro and the Injun?

46:58.018 --> 47:00.020
313.

47:02.656 --> 47:04.525
We don't like bosses.

47:05.959 --> 47:08.361
You like bullets?

47:10.096 --> 47:12.098
What do you want us to do?

47:24.945 --> 47:26.212
(car doors close)

47:26.246 --> 47:28.481
(engine starts)

47:28.515 --> 47:29.482
ZELMARE:
Hey...

47:29.516 --> 47:30.651

47:30.684 --> 47:32.085

47:39.425 --> 47:41.427
Son of a biscuit.

47:56.943 --> 47:58.579
Good afternoon.

47:58.612 --> 48:00.614
Afternoon.

48:01.948 --> 48:04.184
Cup of joe, Doc?

48:09.556 --> 48:11.558
Not today, Nadine.

48:30.611 --> 48:32.579
Am I talking to you,

48:32.613 --> 48:35.315
or am I talking to him?

48:35.348 --> 48:37.584
Please. (sniffles)

48:37.618 --> 48:39.419
Have a seat.

48:39.452 --> 48:41.454
Where is the consigliere?

48:43.690 --> 48:45.692
Please.

48:50.997 --> 48:52.999
(Calamita laughs)

48:55.602 --> 48:57.604
You ever...?

49:00.607 --> 49:03.376
You ever see a baby in a box?

49:03.409 --> 49:04.511
What?

49:04.545 --> 49:06.613
A human baby, I'm saying.

49:06.647 --> 49:11.251
Not some‐‐ what do you‐‐
small dog.

49:11.284 --> 49:13.587
A puppy.

49:13.620 --> 49:15.355
They're called puppies.

49:15.388 --> 49:17.624
(laughs)

49:19.793 --> 49:21.995
I know they are called...

49:25.766 --> 49:28.301
Listen, shit for brains,

49:28.334 --> 49:32.138
this... your little powwows

49:32.172 --> 49:34.140
with the consigliere‐‐

49:34.174 --> 49:36.176
that's over.

49:38.111 --> 49:40.246
You're not listening,

49:40.280 --> 49:42.282
so we are gonna stop talking.

49:53.660 --> 49:58.398
Give some indication you
understand the English language.

49:58.431 --> 50:00.233
I thought you said
we weren't talking.

50:00.266 --> 50:02.302
What?

50:09.075 --> 50:12.378
You said you were done talking,

50:12.412 --> 50:14.715
but then you kept on talking.

50:17.150 --> 50:20.086
(Calamita laughing)

50:22.656 --> 50:24.658
CALAMITA:
You think you're so smart?

50:24.691 --> 50:27.327
Let's see how smart...

50:27.360 --> 50:30.463
you are, talking to my knife.

50:33.600 --> 50:35.602
Wait.

50:37.704 --> 50:39.806
Have you seen a baby in a box?

50:39.840 --> 50:42.142
I was...

50:42.175 --> 50:44.511
a baby in a box, cheese dick.

50:46.547 --> 50:50.083
On the boat, coming over.

50:50.116 --> 50:53.787
Just me and Mama‐‐ 15 years old.

50:53.820 --> 50:56.222
And she died, my mama,

50:56.256 --> 50:59.425
coming into New York Harbor.

51:00.727 --> 51:03.597
Tuberculosis, down in the hold.

51:05.699 --> 51:08.669
So then it's just me‐‐
a baby in a box‐‐ which...

51:08.702 --> 51:10.470
Welcome to America.

51:10.504 --> 51:12.706
Everybody's got a sad story.

51:15.308 --> 51:17.343
No, no, no, no.

51:23.216 --> 51:25.218
You're not getting it.

51:27.621 --> 51:30.757
Why I'm telling you
is not feel bad for me.

51:31.858 --> 51:35.228
Why I'm telling you is,

51:35.261 --> 51:38.398
you need to know...

51:38.431 --> 51:42.736
there ain't a monster on Earth

51:42.769 --> 51:45.238
tougher...

51:45.271 --> 51:49.610
than an orphan in a box.

51:49.643 --> 51:52.813
When you're dead in the street
with shit in your pants,

51:52.846 --> 51:56.550
just remember that...

51:56.583 --> 51:59.786
you should've listened.

52:02.889 --> 52:04.858
Is that a fact?

52:04.891 --> 52:07.761
Yes.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.796
That's a fact.

52:10.897 --> 52:13.366
(sniffles)

52:20.306 --> 52:22.576
Nadine.

52:22.609 --> 52:25.445
I think I'll have
that cup of coffee now.

52:28.615 --> 52:32.485
Son, I hate to be the one
to tell you, but...

52:32.519 --> 52:35.155
you got it all wrong.

52:36.823 --> 52:40.594
Your countryman Machiavelli‐‐

52:40.627 --> 52:42.596
he wrote,

52:42.629 --> 52:47.267
"He who wishes to be obeyed
must know how to command."

52:50.804 --> 52:52.806
Thank you, Nadine.

53:04.350 --> 53:06.620
(sighs)

53:17.463 --> 53:21.001
Like I tried to tell you,

53:21.034 --> 53:24.470
I don't know how
they do it in your country,

53:24.505 --> 53:26.873
but here in America...

53:28.875 --> 53:31.411
...respect is earned.

53:34.915 --> 53:37.250
Ebal‐‐

53:37.283 --> 53:39.720
he earned my respect.

53:45.626 --> 53:47.628
But you...

53:49.696 --> 53:51.698
(laughing):
You...

53:54.334 --> 53:57.871
You're just boys...

53:57.904 --> 54:01.041
making a mess

54:01.074 --> 54:04.010
that one day

54:04.044 --> 54:06.246
I'm gonna have to clean up.

54:08.715 --> 54:09.916
Hmm?

54:14.655 --> 54:16.623
Thanks...

54:16.657 --> 54:18.992
