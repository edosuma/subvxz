riding this every day

18:50.529 --> 18:52.864
in hopes of running
into you again.

18:52.864 --> 18:56.202
You've been riding the elevator
for a week just to meet me?

18:56.202 --> 18:58.170
Yeah, yeah, I can't stop
thinking about you.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.438
I have everyone
in the building in on it.

18:59.438 --> 19:03.074
The doorman. Everyone's like,
"If it's your destiny--"

19:03.074 --> 19:03.575
Stop

19:03.575 --> 19:06.745
stalking me, you creep!

[WHIMPERING]

19:08.614 --> 19:11.983
Agh! Who are you?

19:11.983 --> 19:14.085
Rusty, are you all right?

19:14.085 --> 19:16.087
Ah. Oh, yeah.
I'll be fine.

19:16.087 --> 19:17.723
It usually takes
about eight to 10 minutes

19:17.723 --> 19:21.327
for my eyes to readjust
after getting maced.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.695
Was that her?
Yeah.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.433
Yeah, we've decided
to see other people.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.635
Then it's time you
let me set you up

19:29.635 --> 19:31.303
with one of the girls
from my office.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.505
Oh, well, I don't know.
I think it's too soon,

19:33.505 --> 19:37.909
and plus my eyes are still
burning from the mace.

19:37.909 --> 19:39.110
Are you sure?

19:39.110 --> 19:41.513
I own a small modeling agency.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.881
Ah...

19:42.881 --> 19:44.183
Wait, what's that?

19:44.183 --> 19:48.987
No high fashion, mind you,
just swimsuits and lingerie.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.691
That'll do.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.126
Oscar!

19:55.126 --> 19:56.995

20:01.066 --> 20:02.234
Hey.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.669
Hey, what's up, sunshine?

20:03.669 --> 20:06.071
Look what we got invited to.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.939
Opera tickets?

20:07.939 --> 20:09.708
Who hates me that much?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.877
Jennifer and I fixed up
the guy and the girl

20:11.877 --> 20:13.545
that you and Adam
sold your tickets to.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.847
They've been dating
and they've invited us

20:15.847 --> 20:17.749
to join them at La Bohèème.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.386
All because
you scalped your ticket.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.054
I guess I had this coming.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.126
Wonder how much
I could get for these.
