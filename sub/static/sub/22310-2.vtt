WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.243
<i>- Last year
a competition was created</i>

00:03.287 --> 00:05.787
<i>to test
the nation's best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.831 --> 00:08.165
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:10.042
<i>craftsmen
from all over the country</i>

00:10.085 --> 00:12.252
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:12.296 --> 00:14.129
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:14.173 --> 00:15.756
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.799 --> 00:17.049
- I want to win!

00:17.092 --> 00:18.759
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.802 --> 00:19.927
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:19.970 --> 00:21.637
<i>- Now the Forge returns</i>

00:21.680 --> 00:25.182
<i>with challenges unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:25.226 --> 00:26.975
- You'll be using this.

00:27.019 --> 00:30.270
<i>- Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.314 --> 00:32.272
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.316 --> 00:34.149
<i>Some will fall.</i>

00:34.193 --> 00:35.609
<i>But only the best
will be crowned</i>

00:35.653 --> 00:37.444
<i>"Forged In Fire" champions</i>

00:37.488 --> 00:40.447
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:40.491 --> 00:43.450
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:43.494 --> 00:49.373
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:49.416 --> 00:50.916
<i>- I'm Chris Marks.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:53.418
<i>I've been making blades
for 35 years.</i>

00:53.462 --> 00:55.963
Growing up, I was
an avid outdoorsman...

00:56.006 --> 00:57.673
Hunting, fishing.

00:57.716 --> 00:59.383
<i>There was always a need
for a knife,</i>

00:59.426 --> 01:00.592
so we made our own.

01:00.636 --> 01:02.302
<i>- My name is Zack Jonas.</i>

01:02.346 --> 01:04.012
I've been making knives
for about eight years now.

01:04.056 --> 01:05.597
I am currently
a full-time bladesmith,

01:05.641 --> 01:07.516
operating out of my own studio.

01:07.559 --> 01:09.142
<i>I don't have a violent bone
in my body,</i>

01:09.186 --> 01:11.019
but I just love knives.

01:11.063 --> 01:13.105
<i>- My name is Salem Straub.</i>

01:13.148 --> 01:15.440
I've been making blades
for about 12 years now.

01:15.484 --> 01:18.235
<i>I'm a part-time bladesmith
in my own shop.</i>

01:18.279 --> 01:21.029
I find bladesmithing
to be tremendously satisfying,

01:21.073 --> 01:22.572
<i>in that at the end of the day,</i>

01:22.616 --> 01:25.909
I have something
absolutely quantifiable

01:25.953 --> 01:28.078
to show for my efforts.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.746
<i>- My name is Craig Turnka.</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:31.999
I've been making
blades and swords

01:32.042 --> 01:33.375
for most of my adult life.

01:33.419 --> 01:34.835
<i>I've never had a real job.</i>

01:34.878 --> 01:36.378
<i>I've done this.</i>

01:36.422 --> 01:38.005
I don't have to take a vacation

01:38.048 --> 01:40.716
'cause I'm vacation
every day of the week.

01:40.759 --> 01:43.510
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:43.554 --> 01:46.096
You're here to engage
in three rounds of competition

01:46.140 --> 01:48.056
designed to test every aspect

01:48.100 --> 01:49.850
of your edged-weapons-making
capability,

01:49.893 --> 01:54.104
from design to forging
to fit and finish.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.648
At the end of each round,
you will hand over your work

01:56.692 --> 01:58.567
to our panel of expert judges...

01:58.610 --> 02:01.403
Internationally known
master smith J. Neilson...

02:01.447 --> 02:04.531
next, historic weapons
re-creation specialist

02:04.575 --> 02:06.033
David Baker...

02:06.076 --> 02:09.953
last, edged weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.496
They will decide which of you

02:11.540 --> 02:13.332
will be
the "Forged in Fire" champion

02:13.375 --> 02:16.251
and leave here
with a check for $10,000.

02:16.295 --> 02:18.587
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:18.630 --> 02:20.672
On your anvils in front of you
is a cloth.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.632
Go ahead and lift that cloth up.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.177
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:25.220 --> 02:28.638
That's a pretty solid piece
of cable steel.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.391
Your challenge
is to take that cable steel

02:31.435 --> 02:34.353
and forge it into a blade
of your own design

02:34.396 --> 02:36.021
in your signature style,

02:36.065 --> 02:39.358
turning them into fully
functioning weapons.

02:39.401 --> 02:43.862
Your weapons will then be tested
in a log split...

02:43.906 --> 02:47.199
and their ability to slice
through a pork shoulder.

02:47.242 --> 02:48.617
The blades themselves must fall

02:48.660 --> 02:51.370
within the following
size parameters.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.039
<i>The length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

02:54.083 --> 02:57.501
<i>must be between
10 and 16 inches.</i>

02:57.544 --> 02:59.169
<i>The overall length
of your weapon</i>

02:59.213 --> 03:02.506
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:02.549 --> 03:04.716
<i>You must also include a fuller</i>

03:04.760 --> 03:09.179
<i>that runs half the length
of the blade.</i>

03:09.223 --> 03:11.973
<i>- I've never done anything
like this in three hours.</i>

03:12.017 --> 03:14.851
In fact, I've never done
a fuller before or cable.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.270
- You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

03:17.314 --> 03:20.482
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:20.526 --> 03:23.610
Your time starts now.

03:23.654 --> 03:26.988
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:27.032 --> 03:28.323
- I draw like a third grader,

03:28.367 --> 03:30.992
so I don't know.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.454
My style of knife-making
would be just straight lines

03:34.498 --> 03:36.081
and nice, clean edges.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.708
I'm sketching a bowie
with a finger holder

03:38.752 --> 03:41.211
so it doesn't slide
forward or backward.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.380
I'm a very tenacious competitor.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.090
I mean, if there's
only two shopping carts

03:45.134 --> 03:47.509
left at the Walmart
and one's got a wobbly wheel,

03:47.553 --> 03:49.428
I'm getting it.

03:49.471 --> 03:51.263
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:51.306 --> 03:54.307
<i>- I am drawing
a Greek Kopis-style blade.</i>

03:54.351 --> 03:57.769
<i>It has enough of a point
to stab or slash,</i>

03:57.813 --> 04:00.313
but still
an able chopping knife.

04:00.357 --> 04:03.942
Winning "Forged in Fire"
would be somewhat improbable

04:03.986 --> 04:05.777
and absolutely incredible.

04:05.821 --> 04:07.529
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:07.573 --> 04:11.283
<i>- I'm making, basically,
a bowie camp knife.</i>

04:11.326 --> 04:14.202
<i>I like forging
and blade-making</i>

04:14.246 --> 04:17.038
<i>because it basically
brought the human race</i>

04:17.082 --> 04:23.712
out from the era of throwing
sticks and rocks at each other.

04:23.755 --> 04:27.090
<i>- I decided to design a
competition cutter/camp knife.</i>

04:27.134 --> 04:28.967
<i>It's gonna be
real thick and beefy.</i>

04:29.011 --> 04:30.719
<i>It's designed
to go through that wood</i>

04:30.762 --> 04:33.096
<i>and the hambone as well.</i>

04:33.140 --> 04:35.265
<i>I've never worked
with cable before.</i>

04:35.309 --> 04:36.933
<i>The thing that concerns me most</i>

04:36.977 --> 04:38.768
is definitely gonna be getting
that cable welded up.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.146
<i>Once I've got that, I can grind
a blade, no problem.</i>

04:41.190 --> 04:45.317
- Bladesmiths, your ten-minute
design window is closed.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.030
Your three-hour
forge time starts now.

04:50.073 --> 04:52.407
- Get going.
Start cooking some steel.

04:52.451 --> 04:54.576
- Ah, this is pretty decent.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.161
- These guys have to be careful

04:56.205 --> 04:58.038
that cable steel
doesn't unravel.

04:58.081 --> 05:02.167
- What's the proper way
to actually work this cable?

05:02.211 --> 05:04.211
- You take your cable,
weld the ends

05:04.254 --> 05:07.881
so it's all closed up
so they don't fray,

05:07.925 --> 05:09.216
'cause when you put it
in the fire,

05:09.259 --> 05:11.510
it's gonna expand with the heat.

05:11.553 --> 05:13.345
<i>- I have a fair amount
of experience</i>

05:13.388 --> 05:14.596
<i>working with cable.</i>

05:14.640 --> 05:16.139
<i>With the ends welded,</i>

05:16.183 --> 05:18.350
the prudent thing
to do is to heat it up

05:18.393 --> 05:20.602
<i>and twist it tighter.</i>

05:20.646 --> 05:22.521
- Getting ready for a twist.

05:22.564 --> 05:24.481
- You want to go with
the twist of the cable.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.234
Now, you'll get
a much tighter weld.

05:27.277 --> 05:28.818
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:28.862 --> 05:31.613
<i>- My name, Salem,
is an Americanization</i>

05:31.657 --> 05:34.616
of the Hebrew word "shalom,"
which is, "peace."

05:34.660 --> 05:37.744
<i>My parents are very
peace-loving, anti-conflict,</i>

05:37.788 --> 05:40.330
<i>and even anti-weapon,</i>

05:40.374 --> 05:43.291
but I've chosen
to walk my own path.

05:43.335 --> 05:47.045
- My strategy is to utilize
my time the best

05:47.089 --> 05:49.506
<i>in prepping my forge
with extra bricks</i>

05:49.550 --> 05:52.342
so I was ready
to go in the fire.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.177
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:54.221 --> 05:56.555
- Look at all the flames coming
out of the side of that forge.

05:56.598 --> 05:58.390
That is insane.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.351
- Well, he's got his forge
closed up tight with bricks,

06:01.395 --> 06:03.228
so he is maintaining
as much heat

06:03.272 --> 06:05.605
inside that forge as he can.

06:05.649 --> 06:07.566
<i>- I'm competing for myself</i>

06:07.609 --> 06:09.943
<i>and everyone else
in this country</i>

06:09.987 --> 06:13.655
to show that we are a country

06:13.699 --> 06:17.492
of skilled people.

06:17.536 --> 06:19.619
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:19.663 --> 06:22.080
- To get the cable welded up,
I know I have to heat it,

06:22.124 --> 06:23.957
and I know I have to twist it.

06:24.001 --> 06:25.625
- Zack's going right
into the fire.

06:25.669 --> 06:26.918
He hasn't even closed up

06:26.962 --> 06:28.420
the ends of that cable
or anything.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.797
- Yep, he should've welded
the ends closed.

06:30.841 --> 06:32.882
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:32.926 --> 06:37.053
- Ah, he's twisting.
He's twisting it closed.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.847
- Oh, oh.

06:38.890 --> 06:42.267
He's lost two whole rounds
off that cable.

06:42.311 --> 06:45.770
- That's not good.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.564
- Oh, great.
His cable is falling apart.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.316
- It just fell apart.

06:49.359 --> 06:51.276
Putting that in there without
the ends welded together,

06:51.320 --> 06:52.694
the heat made 'em expand.

06:52.738 --> 06:54.988
It pushes 'em apart.

06:55.032 --> 06:56.406
- Is this a disaster

06:56.450 --> 06:58.325
that that thing
fell apart just now?

06:58.368 --> 07:00.201
- This is really, really,
really, really bad.

07:00.245 --> 07:03.913
- I'm thinking I may have made
a critical error early on here.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.916
If I can't get these bars
welded up, I'm screwed.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.379
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:11.423 --> 07:12.839
- Oh.

07:12.883 --> 07:16.051
So Craig is trying
to twist on the press.

07:16.094 --> 07:19.387
- To forge and get that welded
as quickly as possible,

07:19.431 --> 07:22.807
you have to think
of packing it like a snowball.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.476
Now we get to the fun stuff.

07:24.519 --> 07:27.062
[metal clanging]

07:27.105 --> 07:31.107
- Wow.
- Craig is setting some welds.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.734
- He's doing the music.

07:32.778 --> 07:34.778
He's doing the tap
to keep his rhythm going.

07:34.821 --> 07:38.031
- Things you should know
about weapons...

07:38.075 --> 07:39.532
they rule the world.

07:39.576 --> 07:42.786
- Bladesmiths, you
have two hours remaining!

07:42.829 --> 07:44.871
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:44.915 --> 07:46.915
- Having fun yet?
- Oh, I'm having a ball.

07:46.958 --> 07:48.958
- Me too.
- Two whole hours?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.878
I can at least make a bar
of steel in two hours...

07:51.922 --> 07:53.755
maybe.

07:53.799 --> 07:57.342
- Zack... he's just traveling
on a different road right now.

07:57.386 --> 08:00.887
<i>- The strands of cable
are not forge-welded together.</i>

08:00.931 --> 08:02.430
It's just not working for me.

08:02.474 --> 08:05.308
I'm having
a really hard time with it.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.560
- Finally on that hammer.

08:07.604 --> 08:09.354
It looks like the end
is spreading out

08:09.398 --> 08:11.773
- Fraying again.
- Oh, no.

08:11.817 --> 08:13.525
- He's killing me.
- No, no, no.

08:13.568 --> 08:16.528
- It looks like the end
of Elmer Fudd's gun right now

08:16.571 --> 08:19.239
after Bugs Bunny
has stuck his finger in it.

08:19.282 --> 08:22.117
[blades humming]

08:22.160 --> 08:23.618
- But no giving up.

08:23.662 --> 08:25.078
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:25.122 --> 08:26.996
- Chris is setting his fuller.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.373
- Power stroke, baby.

08:28.417 --> 08:29.874
- He's going
for the fire stroke.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.293
- The anvil
was not of sufficient weight

08:32.337 --> 08:35.672
<i>to sink a fuller depression
into the blade.</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:37.966
I just have to grind
the fuller in.

08:38.009 --> 08:40.927
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:40.971 --> 08:43.221
- Chris is a bad mama jama
with an angle grinder.

08:43.265 --> 08:45.098
- I'll tell you.
He's going to town.

08:45.142 --> 08:47.225
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:47.269 --> 08:49.602
<i>- Time is flying by.</i>

08:49.646 --> 08:52.480
I could use a little more time.

08:52.524 --> 08:55.692
I'm a ancient master bladesmith,
not a current one.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.694
[chuckles]

08:57.738 --> 08:59.654
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:59.698 --> 09:01.823
- And then we've got Craig
over here on the end

09:01.867 --> 09:04.409
who's making a monster.

09:04.453 --> 09:07.996
- I'm checking for straightness
'cause I'm one-eyed.

09:08.039 --> 09:09.539
I'm left-eyed.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.583
Most people think
your eyeballs are ambidextrous,

09:11.626 --> 09:13.168
but they're obviously not.

09:13.211 --> 09:14.711
I'm definitely
left eye dominant,

09:14.755 --> 09:17.881
which means that
I like long walks on the beach

09:17.924 --> 09:22.177
with Kenny G
and things like that.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.678
This is what it's about.

09:23.722 --> 09:26.014
It's about having fun.

09:26.057 --> 09:31.478
<i>¶ ¶</i>

09:31.521 --> 09:32.812
I just go to stamp in the fuller

09:32.856 --> 09:34.856
and kind of clicked it
along there.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.649
<i>Obviously, when you stamp it
on one side,</i>

09:36.693 --> 09:38.735
<i>it reverses on the other side.</i>

09:38.779 --> 09:40.904
- He'd better hope he has
everything lined up straight.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.323
Otherwise, those fullers
are gonna be offset.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.366
<i>- So that wasn't
the smartest thing</i>

09:45.410 --> 09:47.243
I've done in my entire life.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.496
- One hour, bladesmiths!

09:49.539 --> 09:51.289
You have one hour remaining!

09:51.333 --> 09:54.000
- One hour.
One hour!

09:54.044 --> 09:57.545
- And two hours in, I have
something shaped like a bar.

09:57.589 --> 10:00.089
Time crunch for me
is excitement.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
I work really well
under pressure.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.051
<i>It's a certain kind of focus</i>

10:03.094 --> 10:04.594
<i>that just sort of snaps
into place,</i>

10:04.638 --> 10:06.596
and even when everything's
going to hell,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.389
I like working
against a deadline.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.350
I should be able
to make something.

10:10.393 --> 10:13.228
- I suck, man.

10:13.271 --> 10:15.730
<i>To fix my fuller,
I go to the grinder,</i>

10:15.774 --> 10:19.359
and I'm a fish out of water.

10:19.402 --> 10:20.860
<i>I just don't feel comfortable.</i>

10:20.904 --> 10:23.196
I'm not really
getting things done.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.533
<i>I'm just not making
very good lines on my blade.</i>

10:26.576 --> 10:29.619
Thank God you can't look
at both sides at the same time.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.704
- 15 minutes remaining!

10:31.748 --> 10:34.374
- Zack is over there
throwing some sparks.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.292
- Zack's putting his fuller
in the blade,

10:36.336 --> 10:37.919
coming from behind.

10:37.963 --> 10:39.838
- He can pull something out.
- Yeah.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.548
<i>- I really got
to get something going,</i>

10:41.591 --> 10:43.383
<i>so I hit the grinder.</i>

10:43.426 --> 10:45.718
I'm just trying to get something
done to meet the parameters.

10:45.762 --> 10:47.345
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:47.389 --> 10:49.639
both:
Zack quenched his blade.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.350
- First one in the fire.
- Good for him.

10:52.394 --> 10:55.228
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:55.272 --> 10:57.230
Chris is in the oil.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.648
- Okay.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.775
- Salem and Craig
still have to quench.

11:00.819 --> 11:02.360
- Ah!

11:02.404 --> 11:03.903
Quench is not the last thing
you do on a blade.

11:03.947 --> 11:05.154
- No.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.573
- Give yourself
that little safety net.

11:06.616 --> 11:09.701
If you've got a warp,
you can fix it.

11:09.744 --> 11:11.411
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:11.454 --> 11:13.913
- Quench, quench, quench.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.499
- You have
five minutes remaining!

11:16.543 --> 11:19.085
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:19.129 --> 11:22.630
- There you go!
Thank you.

11:22.674 --> 11:24.173
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:24.217 --> 11:28.094
- Three little bladesmiths
that are quenched,

11:28.138 --> 11:31.055
and then we've got Salem.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.349
- I'm finishing up grinding
and the fuller

11:33.393 --> 11:35.393
and becoming ready
for heat treat,

11:35.437 --> 11:38.605
and I feel a voice saying...

11:38.648 --> 11:41.608
"Hopefully you still
got enough time to do that."

11:41.651 --> 11:44.277
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:44.321 --> 11:46.237
I might not have
a heat-treated knife

11:46.281 --> 11:48.072
coming out of this thing.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.956
- You have
five minutes remaining!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.876
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:59.920 --> 12:01.836
- I might not have
a heat-treated knife

12:01.880 --> 12:03.671
coming out of this thing.

12:03.715 --> 12:05.715
- When you rush your quench,

12:05.759 --> 12:09.469
you can wind up
with all kinds of problems.

12:09.512 --> 12:12.472
We've seen that be
the deciding factor before.

12:12.515 --> 12:13.973
- 20 seconds!

12:14.017 --> 12:16.392
- Now, now!

12:16.436 --> 12:20.688
There he goes, right now.

12:20.732 --> 12:22.857
Oh, my God.

12:22.901 --> 12:25.985
See? See?
- It's got a warp.

12:26.029 --> 12:29.197
- Ten, nine, eight,

12:29.240 --> 12:32.325
seven, six, five,

12:32.369 --> 12:36.371
four, three, two, one,

12:36.414 --> 12:37.664
stop working!

12:37.707 --> 12:42.627
Your forging time is now over!

12:42.671 --> 12:45.797
- I'm interested to see whether
that blade hardened fully.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.216
<i>I think the edge hardened fully,</i>

12:48.259 --> 12:49.550
but it's just possible

12:49.594 --> 12:52.345
that it's binded
and fully hardened.

12:52.389 --> 12:53.721
<i>- I look down at my blade,</i>

12:53.765 --> 12:55.640
and it is unequivocally
the ugliest blade

12:55.684 --> 12:57.141
I've ever made,
but it's a blade.

12:57.185 --> 12:58.518
I finished something,

12:58.561 --> 13:00.311
and given my critical errors
early on,

13:00.355 --> 13:03.064
<i>I'm excited
that I got something.</i>

13:03.108 --> 13:05.441
- Bladesmiths,
your first-round challenge

13:05.485 --> 13:07.568
was to take a piece
of cable steel

13:07.612 --> 13:09.320
and forge a signature blade

13:09.364 --> 13:10.738
of your own design

13:10.782 --> 13:14.117
that was between
12 and 16 inches long.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.786
That blade must also
have included a fuller

13:16.830 --> 13:20.081
that ran at least half
the length of the blade.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.958
Craig, let's start with you.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.793
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:23.837 --> 13:26.170
<i>- Well, Craig,
it's a good design.</i>

13:26.214 --> 13:28.506
<i>My concern is
there's still too much meat</i>

13:28.550 --> 13:29.882
<i>on the blade here,</i>

13:29.926 --> 13:31.801
which affects
my feel for balance.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.636
Beautiful, though.
Thank you.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.389
- Thank you, sir.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.558
- You were swinging
that hammer great,

13:38.601 --> 13:39.976
but maybe a little more familiar

13:40.020 --> 13:41.436
with the hammer
than the grinder?

13:41.479 --> 13:42.812
- Yes, sir.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.606
- Big camp bowie.
It should work well.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.650
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.362
- Salem, please present
your blade to the judges.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.406
<i>- Nice shape, altogether.</i>

13:53.450 --> 13:56.784
<i>Your fuller...
Nice, clean, beautiful work.</i>

13:56.828 --> 13:58.953
It's gonna be interesting
to see whether or not

13:58.997 --> 14:00.955
this blade has hardened enough.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.832
- Salem, it's very nice work,
but I got to tell you,

14:02.876 --> 14:04.959
we were sitting over here trying
to do the Jedi mind trick

14:05.003 --> 14:06.461
to get you to quench that blade.

14:06.504 --> 14:08.129
What was going through your head
with that?

14:08.173 --> 14:10.673
- I was just trying to do
the best job possible.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.924
Barely made it.

14:11.968 --> 14:14.093
- Yeah, barely.

14:14.137 --> 14:17.096
- Zack, please present
your blade to the judges.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.474
<i>- Your fuller's not
overly developed,</i>

14:19.517 --> 14:21.142
<i>but it's there.</i>

14:21.186 --> 14:23.061
<i>When you see a knife
that's been ground</i>

14:23.104 --> 14:24.896
and you can still
see those wobbles

14:24.939 --> 14:26.481
<i>climbing through that grind,</i>

14:26.524 --> 14:28.204
<i>it kind of tells me
that some of this metal</i>

14:28.234 --> 14:31.527
is still not one piece.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.987
- Now, tell me
about your design here.

14:33.031 --> 14:35.156
- Very little survived
from my original design.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.699
I had to cut off
a lot of my material

14:36.743 --> 14:38.910
that just was really
not welding.

14:38.953 --> 14:41.412
- Congratulations for finishing
and turning in a good blade.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.206
- Thank you.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.624
- All right, Chris,

14:44.667 --> 14:46.584
please present your blade
to the judges.

14:46.628 --> 14:48.961
<i>- Chris, I love
the traditional design.</i>

14:49.005 --> 14:50.963
<i>The welds look nice and tight.</i>

14:51.007 --> 14:52.632
<i>You had that time issue.</i>

14:52.675 --> 14:54.634
I like the fact that you
didn't deal with the handle

14:54.677 --> 14:56.427
and stuck with the blade...
Very nice.

14:56.471 --> 14:58.763
- Thank you.

14:58.807 --> 15:01.557
- Classic design.
Nice and clean.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.101
I'm looking forward to see

15:03.144 --> 15:05.603
what this would look like
if you get to round two.

15:05.647 --> 15:07.647
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

15:07.690 --> 15:10.566
- Well, bladesmiths, only three
of you can move forward,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.318
and one of you must go home,

15:12.362 --> 15:14.737
and the judges need some time
to make that decision.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.906
Thank you.
Leave your blades.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.534
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:19.577 --> 15:21.702
- Yeah.
That was... that was rough.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.789
- Yeah, I was sweating it
a little there.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.041
- So, let's start with
Craig's blade down on the end.

15:27.085 --> 15:28.543
Doug?

15:28.586 --> 15:31.754
<i>- It's a good-constructed
blade.</i>

15:31.798 --> 15:33.881
<i>He put a finger weld
on the handle,</i>

15:33.925 --> 15:36.050
but the weight
is too forward on this,

15:36.094 --> 15:39.095
so how he balances this out

15:39.139 --> 15:42.348
will actually tell us how well
that grip is gonna work.

15:42.392 --> 15:46.144
- One of these fullers
is higher than the other,

15:46.187 --> 15:48.771
<i>and I have a feeling that when
he evens those fullers out,</i>

15:48.815 --> 15:50.231
<i>he might blow through.</i>

15:50.275 --> 15:51.858
- It ought to split wood.

15:51.901 --> 15:53.901
- I know,
but it might go big and go home.

15:53.945 --> 15:56.320
[laughter]

15:56.364 --> 15:58.072
- Let's move on
to Salem's blade.

15:58.116 --> 16:01.117
- Well, Salem's
just got an elegant design here.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.785
<i>I mean, the lines
on this knife...</i>

16:02.829 --> 16:04.412
<i>It's beautifully straight.</i>

16:04.455 --> 16:05.997
<i>At this point,</i>

16:06.040 --> 16:07.874
<i>he could put a guard
and a handle on this</i>

16:07.917 --> 16:09.500
and have a finished piece.

16:09.544 --> 16:10.918
- J.?

16:10.962 --> 16:12.461
- My big thing
is the rushed heat treat.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.255
I mean, I keep saying
over and over,

16:14.299 --> 16:17.091
the heart and soul of the blade
is in the heat treat,

16:17.135 --> 16:20.511
and that two-minute quench
always worries me.

16:20.555 --> 16:23.222
- I wish I'd been able to get,
like, a cleaner finish on that.

16:23.266 --> 16:24.724
- That's all right.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.100
If it's hardened,
grind it clean later.

16:26.144 --> 16:28.895
- Let's move on to Zack's blade.

16:28.938 --> 16:31.480
<i>- There are
so many unwelded sections,</i>

16:31.524 --> 16:33.858
<i>and they're traveling
all the way down the spine,</i>

16:33.902 --> 16:35.776
<i>even in the fuller,</i>

16:35.820 --> 16:39.655
<i>so it's not one solid
homogenous piece of steel.</i>

16:39.699 --> 16:41.532
- The ends kept splaying out.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:41.576 --> 16:44.493
- I just cut my losses,
literally.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.579
- The good thing
is he never gave up.

16:46.623 --> 16:48.456
He kept on trying
to fix the problem,

16:48.499 --> 16:51.083
and he turned in a blade.

16:51.127 --> 16:53.711
- So let's take a look
at Chris's blade.

16:53.755 --> 16:56.672
<i>- This is
a very great foundation</i>

16:56.716 --> 16:58.507
<i>for a high-performance blade.</i>

16:58.551 --> 17:00.134
<i>The welds are nice and tight,</i>

17:00.178 --> 17:02.178
<i>and the blade is even.</i>

17:02.222 --> 17:05.014
This is one solid piece
of steel.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.599
- Dave?

17:06.643 --> 17:08.392
- There's a lot
of work to do here,

17:08.436 --> 17:10.186
but it's a great foundation.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.605
It's well on its way.
Nice work.

17:12.649 --> 17:16.859
- It's a good-looking knife.
- Oh, I think so.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.987
- All right, judges, it's time
for you to make a decision.

17:20.031 --> 17:22.073
Doug, have you decided?
- Yes, I have.

17:22.116 --> 17:23.366
- Dave?
- I have.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.825
- J.?
- Yes.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.911
- All right,
let's go tell our smiths.

17:26.955 --> 17:31.457
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:31.501 --> 17:33.793
Well, bladesmiths, in this first
round of competition,

17:33.836 --> 17:35.962
we asked you to turn
in a finished blade

17:36.005 --> 17:38.256
of your own design
in your signature style,

17:38.299 --> 17:39.799
and you've all done that.

17:39.842 --> 17:41.634
Congratulations.

17:41.678 --> 17:43.469
But now, unfortunately,

17:43.513 --> 17:46.597
it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

17:46.641 --> 17:52.186
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:52.230 --> 17:56.691
Zack, your blade
did not make the cut.

17:56.734 --> 17:59.735
- Zack, you had that problem
at the very start.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.195
<i>Your wire blew apart,</i>

18:01.239 --> 18:02.571
<i>and you came up
with a good solution,</i>

18:02.615 --> 18:04.073
but you were chasing
that for so long,

18:04.117 --> 18:05.700
it really hurt you.

18:05.743 --> 18:08.995
There were too many open welds
throughout the blade

18:09.038 --> 18:10.997
for us to let it go through.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.291
- Zack, please surrender
your weapon.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.960
<i>¶ ¶</i>

18:16.004 --> 18:17.670
<i>- Given the mistakes
that I made early on,</i>

18:17.714 --> 18:19.630
<i>I sort of shot myself
in the foot</i>

18:19.674 --> 18:22.258
<i>in terms of the opportunity
to really show off my skills,</i>

18:22.302 --> 18:24.218
so I have no one
to blame but myself.

18:24.262 --> 18:26.637
<i>I didn't really demonstrate
what I'm capable of,</i>

18:26.681 --> 18:28.472
<i>and, ultimately,
it's just not a good blade.</i>

18:28.516 --> 18:30.099
I wouldn't trust it
to cut butter.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.184
<i>¶ ¶</i>

18:32.228 --> 18:34.068
- Bladesmiths, congratulations

18:34.105 --> 18:36.355
on making it through
to the second round.

18:36.399 --> 18:39.525
Your round-two challenge
is to finish your blades

18:39.569 --> 18:40.943
by attaching a handle

18:40.987 --> 18:43.154
from the range of materials
provided to you,

18:43.197 --> 18:45.990
turning them
into fully functioning weapons.

18:46.034 --> 18:49.368
You will have three hours
to finish your blades.

18:49.412 --> 18:52.038
You can use that time
to address any flaws or issues

18:52.081 --> 18:54.915
that were identified
with your blades.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.417
When the time runs out,

18:56.461 --> 19:00.796
your blades will be tested
in a log split...

19:00.840 --> 19:03.883
and ham-shoulder slice.

19:03.926 --> 19:06.385
Keep in mind
that after this round,

19:06.429 --> 19:09.138
one of you will be asked
to surrender his weapon

19:09.182 --> 19:11.140
and leave the Forge.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.393
Good luck.
Your time starts now.

19:14.437 --> 19:16.645
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:16.689 --> 19:18.773
<i>- The single most
important thing</i>

19:18.816 --> 19:21.734
is getting your knife
sharp enough to cut something.

19:21.778 --> 19:25.071
<i>A very close second to that is
getting a handle on your knife</i>

19:25.114 --> 19:27.656
so that it can be handled
as weapon.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
If I do both of those things,

19:29.744 --> 19:32.536
I might conceivably make it
through the next round,

19:32.580 --> 19:34.330
even if I fail
at everything else.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.956
- I'm gonna have to go
with this.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.833
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:37.877 --> 19:40.544
<i>The strategy is to put
a nice handle</i>

19:40.588 --> 19:42.296
with a finger groove in it

19:42.340 --> 19:45.257
and keep as much strength
in the blade part as possible.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.009
- He's working on his handle,

19:47.053 --> 19:49.345
but, to me, he's got to thin
that entire blade out.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.889
That thing is huge.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.016
<i>- Some of the criticism
of the knife</i>

19:54.060 --> 19:56.310
was that it was big and heavy,

19:56.354 --> 19:58.896
<i>and so the nicer you can make
it fit in your hand,</i>

19:58.940 --> 20:00.689
<i>the lighter it will become,</i>

20:00.733 --> 20:03.067
<i>and I think that that offsets
some of the weight.</i>

20:03.111 --> 20:06.070
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:06.114 --> 20:08.155
<i>- I feel I have a sound blade.</i>

20:08.199 --> 20:10.491
It's just a matter
of completing it

20:10.535 --> 20:13.411
and getting it
balanced and sharpened.

20:13.454 --> 20:15.496
- So I like Chris's grinding.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.416
Nice two inches
of sparks flying down.

20:18.459 --> 20:20.042
<i>- Kind of a Zen moment.</i>

20:20.086 --> 20:23.212
You get in the zone,
and you have to focus.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.005
Oh!

20:25.049 --> 20:27.341
We're doing it.
We're making fire!

20:27.385 --> 20:29.218
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:29.262 --> 20:30.970
- I am making
a fighter-style handle

20:31.013 --> 20:33.597
<i>and a guard, given my design.</i>

20:33.641 --> 20:35.182
- Every time
they're making the guard,

20:35.226 --> 20:37.184
it's a filing of that guard
to make it fit.

20:37.228 --> 20:39.353
- We've seen people fight
that until they give up,

20:39.397 --> 20:41.814
grind a hole,
pour a bunch of glue.

20:41.858 --> 20:45.151
- Which is what
you don't want to see.

20:45.194 --> 20:48.028
<i>- I am now stuck
making a knife with a guard,</i>

20:48.072 --> 20:50.197
and that takes time.

20:50.241 --> 20:54.452
- Bladesmiths, you have
90 minutes remaining!

20:54.495 --> 20:56.328
- Okay, so that smell.

20:56.372 --> 20:57.872
- Oh, that epoxy is burning up.

20:57.915 --> 20:59.999
- It's losing
all its tensile strength.

21:00.042 --> 21:03.586
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:03.629 --> 21:05.504
- Craig's not happy.
- He's waiting on his handle.

21:05.548 --> 21:08.174
- That's 'cause
his epoxy's let go.

21:08.217 --> 21:09.675
They're not fun to clean up

21:09.719 --> 21:11.469
once you start having problems
with 'em.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.929
- [bleep], [bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

21:18.227 --> 21:20.436
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:20.480 --> 21:22.813
- [bleep], [bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

21:22.857 --> 21:24.482
- Craig's not happy.
- He's waiting on his handle.

21:24.525 --> 21:27.776
- That's 'cause
his epoxy's let go.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.821
<i>- I had warped it
whenever I heated up the rivet.</i>

21:30.865 --> 21:32.156
- Craig should've worked
on the blade

21:32.200 --> 21:33.616
and gotten all that stuff done

21:33.659 --> 21:35.701
before he started
working on the handle

21:35.745 --> 21:37.119
and setting it up.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.537
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:38.581 --> 21:40.789
- Well,
I'm just gonna re-epoxy it,

21:40.833 --> 21:42.583
and hopefully it'll set.

21:42.627 --> 21:45.002
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:45.046 --> 21:48.339
I think my handle's
gonna be just fine.

21:48.382 --> 21:50.758
- Chris is still
over on the grinder.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.551
What about the handle?

21:52.595 --> 21:54.637
- I'm assuming he's planning
on doing a very quick

21:54.680 --> 21:56.305
and efficient handle.

21:56.349 --> 21:59.475
- From past experience,
I've found that if you rush,

21:59.519 --> 22:02.102
sometimes you'll either
injure yourself

22:02.146 --> 22:04.230
or have to redo the process.

22:04.273 --> 22:07.942
- He's a real
old-school bladesmith,

22:07.985 --> 22:11.570
but he needs time to sharpen
and put a handle on that blade.

22:11.614 --> 22:16.408
- Well, running kind of tight,
but we'll see what'll happen.

22:16.452 --> 22:19.370
- You have 30 minutes remaining!

22:19.413 --> 22:21.664
30 minutes, bladesmiths!

22:21.707 --> 22:23.165
<i>- With the handle epoxy,</i>

22:23.209 --> 22:25.042
every minute counts out there
on the floor.

22:25.086 --> 22:28.879
- Salem's got... still has
an entire handle to shape.

22:28.923 --> 22:30.631
<i>- I start really
hogging in there.</i>

22:30.675 --> 22:32.007
<i>Time is beginning to run down.</i>

22:32.051 --> 22:34.011
I'm just trying
to roughly sculpt it

22:34.053 --> 22:35.761
into a comfortable shape.

22:35.805 --> 22:37.638
<i>¶ ¶</i>

22:37.682 --> 22:39.598
- Look, it's Chris.

22:39.642 --> 22:41.684
- I told you
he's our sleeper, man.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.478
- I noticed the clock
was counting down on me,

22:44.522 --> 22:48.607
<i>so I needed to get
the handle together.</i>

22:48.651 --> 22:51.277
- Ten, nine, eight,

22:51.320 --> 22:54.572
seven, six, five,

22:54.615 --> 22:56.740
four, three,

22:56.784 --> 22:58.826
two, one.

22:58.869 --> 23:00.619
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines,

23:00.663 --> 23:01.870
stop all your work,

23:01.914 --> 23:03.581
and please return to your anvils

23:03.624 --> 23:05.958
with your finished weapon.

23:06.002 --> 23:08.127
<i>- I didn't make the best knife
in the whole wide world,</i>

23:08.170 --> 23:10.129
so let's just see
if I can motor on with it,

23:10.172 --> 23:12.881
and maybe someone else
sucks worse than I do.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.634
<i>- It's really
up to the testing now.</i>

23:15.678 --> 23:18.554
It just depends on
how tough that ham is.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.723
[chuckles]

23:20.766 --> 23:22.808
- All right, smiths,
welcome to our strength test...

23:22.852 --> 23:24.560
The Log Split.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.645
I'm gonna take
each of your knives

23:26.689 --> 23:29.607
and baton them
through these logs,

23:29.650 --> 23:31.609
and it's gonna test
how your edge geometry

23:31.652 --> 23:34.153
and your edge retention
holds up.

23:34.196 --> 23:35.362
Craig, are you ready?

23:35.406 --> 23:37.656
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it.

23:37.700 --> 23:45.623
<i>¶ ¶</i>

23:51.922 --> 23:53.756
You got a good split on there.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.216
Wedged it right apart
in one shot.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.970
Well done.
- Thank you.

24:00.014 --> 24:01.889
<i>- Salem, you're up now.
Are you ready?</i>

24:01.932 --> 24:04.141
- Yeah.
Let's do it up.

24:04.185 --> 24:06.935
I'm feeling a little tense,
but not in a bad way.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.520
<i>It's exciting.</i>

24:08.564 --> 24:11.440
<i>I feel like my knife
is gonna work well.</i>

24:11.484 --> 24:19.484
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:19.659 --> 24:21.158
- Blade looks perfect...

24:21.202 --> 24:24.161
No deformation on the edge,
no chips,

24:24.205 --> 24:26.664
just a hair away from splitting
all the way down.

24:26.707 --> 24:27.748
Nicely done.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.751
- Thank you.

24:30.795 --> 24:32.544
<i>- Chris, you're up.
You ready to go?</i>

24:32.588 --> 24:34.421
- Ready to go.

24:34.465 --> 24:36.799
<i>I feel pretty confident
with the blade I've produced.</i>

24:36.842 --> 24:38.384
I know have the weight

24:38.427 --> 24:41.178
that's proper
for a chopping weapon.

24:41.222 --> 24:49.144
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:51.649 --> 24:55.067
It really doesn't do
much of anything.

24:55.111 --> 24:57.111
- Oh, Chris, we had a little bit
of an issue.

24:57.154 --> 25:00.155
It's a really thick edge here.
I mean, it's almost like a V.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.990
So it wasn't getting
the penetration and splitting

25:02.034 --> 25:04.451
quite as well as I was hoping.

25:04.495 --> 25:07.705
Other than that,
the edge held up fine...

25:07.748 --> 25:09.498
Still sharp.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.208
Nicely done.

25:11.252 --> 25:12.793
Now I'm gonna pass you on
to Doug

25:12.837 --> 25:14.878
for the sharpness test.

25:14.922 --> 25:17.089
- To test the sharpness
of your blade,

25:17.133 --> 25:19.466
I will run the edge
of your blade three times

25:19.510 --> 25:21.468
against this ham shoulder.

25:21.512 --> 25:22.720
Craig, you ready?

25:22.763 --> 25:25.013
- Let's make some bacon.

25:25.057 --> 25:32.980
<i>¶ ¶</i>

25:36.569 --> 25:38.026
- Well done, Craig.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.403
When I dragged it across,

25:39.447 --> 25:41.363
the finger weld
in the handle feels good.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.532
That is a sharp knife.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.701
It will cut.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.786
Salem, it's your turn.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.621
<i>- I know I got that knife sharp,</i>

25:49.665 --> 25:51.373
<i>so I feel like it's probably
gonna do pretty good</i>

25:51.417 --> 25:53.167
<i>on that pork.</i>

25:53.210 --> 26:01.133
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:03.053 --> 26:05.053
- Well, Salem,
your blade is very sharp,

26:05.097 --> 26:06.346
as you can see.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.974
Excellent balance...
It will cut.

26:09.018 --> 26:11.852
- Thank you.
- Chris, you're up.

26:11.896 --> 26:13.562
- Let's do it.

26:13.606 --> 26:17.149
<i>Their knives
performed really well.</i>

26:17.193 --> 26:20.486
Unless I slice the hide
of a hog very well,

26:20.529 --> 26:24.198
<i>I think my chances are slim
to none on moving forward.</i>

26:24.241 --> 26:27.701
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:31.248 --> 26:33.707
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:33.751 --> 26:35.751
- Chris, you're up.
- Let's do it.

26:35.795 --> 26:43.717
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:49.642 --> 26:51.602
- Well, Chris,
it'll graze the blade

26:51.644 --> 26:52.976
and cut a little bit through,

26:53.020 --> 26:55.103
but the edge
is not sharp all the way,

26:55.147 --> 26:56.980
even at the top here.

26:57.024 --> 26:58.607
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:58.651 --> 27:01.902
- Bladesmiths, each of
your blades performed admirably.

27:01.946 --> 27:04.071
However, based
on the testing alone,

27:04.114 --> 27:07.658
the judges have made a decision.

27:07.701 --> 27:11.578
Chris, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:11.622 --> 27:14.456
- Chris, I appreciated watching
you forge-weld that cable.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.417
You did a great job,
but you had a very thick edge,

27:17.461 --> 27:21.129
and it didn't perform as well
as the other blades.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.632
- Chris, please
surrender your weapon.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.717
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:25.761 --> 27:29.721
<i>- I'm going home because
I did not complete the knife</i>

27:29.765 --> 27:32.724
as efficiently as I could have.

27:32.768 --> 27:35.644
I've been in this art form
and trade

27:35.688 --> 27:38.856
long enough to see my downfall.

27:38.899 --> 27:41.525
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:41.569 --> 27:44.111
- Salem, Craig, congratulations.

27:44.154 --> 27:45.529
You've made it
into the final round

27:45.573 --> 27:47.990
of "Forged in Fire."

27:48.033 --> 27:50.117
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

27:50.160 --> 27:53.161
to create an iconic blade
from history...

27:53.205 --> 27:56.456
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:56.500 --> 27:58.125
The Egyptian Khopesh.

27:58.168 --> 27:59.710
- Cool.

27:59.753 --> 28:02.045
<i>- Dating back to 2,500 B.C.,</i>

28:02.089 --> 28:04.047
<i>the Khopesh
was a curved sickle sword</i>

28:04.091 --> 28:06.925
<i>adopted by Egyptians
from the Canaanites.</i>

28:06.969 --> 28:09.011
<i>It was used
to execute their enemies,</i>

28:09.054 --> 28:10.721
<i>as an infantry weapon,</i>

28:10.764 --> 28:13.682
<i>and also as a symbol of
the authority of their nobles.</i>

28:13.726 --> 28:15.642
<i>The unique shape
of their curved blades</i>

28:15.686 --> 28:17.769
<i>meant they could be used
to hook a shield,</i>

28:17.813 --> 28:20.272
<i>snag an opponent's leg
and attempt to trip them,</i>

28:20.316 --> 28:23.108
<i>or even tangle
an opposing weapon.</i>

28:23.152 --> 28:24.776
<i>The weapon's distinctive design</i>

28:24.820 --> 28:27.112
<i>makes the Khopesh
easily recognizable</i>

28:27.156 --> 28:30.616
<i>in television series
such as "Game of Thrones."</i>

28:30.659 --> 28:32.159
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:32.202 --> 28:34.494
It must be an effective,
working version

28:34.538 --> 28:36.455
of that North African weapon.

28:36.498 --> 28:39.416
<i>- Looks like a Hot Wheels
race track all bent up.</i>

28:39.460 --> 28:42.419
I've never made
a blade like this.

28:42.463 --> 28:45.339
- The blade itself must fall
within the following parameters.

28:45.382 --> 28:50.010
The length of the blade must be
between 28 and 32 inches,

28:50.054 --> 28:53.096
and the blade must have a curve.

28:53.140 --> 28:56.558
- I haven't done a sword with
a curved edge of this length.

28:56.602 --> 29:00.520
I'm gonna have to throw
all my resources at this.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.314
- You will have five days
at your home forge

29:02.358 --> 29:04.107
to work on your Khopesh.

29:04.151 --> 29:05.859
You will deliver
your finished Khopesh

29:05.903 --> 29:07.235
to our panel of judges.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.695
They will submit those weapons

29:08.739 --> 29:11.865
to a series of dynamic
and strenuous tests.

29:11.909 --> 29:13.784
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:13.827 --> 29:15.494
Only after those tests
are completed

29:15.537 --> 29:17.120
will they declare one of you

29:17.164 --> 29:18.580
the "Forged in Fire" champion

29:18.624 --> 29:21.667
and the recipient
of a $10,000 check.

29:21.710 --> 29:23.418
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.338
We'll see you in five days.

29:26.382 --> 29:29.424
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:29.468 --> 29:31.969
<i>- It's day one.
I am working on design.</i>

29:32.012 --> 29:34.429
I have never tried
making a Khopesh before.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.431
<i>This is out of my wheelhouse.</i>

29:36.475 --> 29:39.393
This is a Khopesh
from the tomb of Ramses II.

29:39.436 --> 29:42.354
This was another Khopesh
found in Tutankhamen's tomb...

29:42.398 --> 29:44.481
Absolutely gorgeous.

29:44.525 --> 29:47.567
The judges are gonna be looking
for historical accuracy.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.194
A lot of these,
historically, are, like,

29:49.238 --> 29:51.279
25 inches in length or less,

29:51.323 --> 29:55.492
so I got to scale it up
to have a 30-inch blade.

29:55.536 --> 29:58.203
<i>Traditionally, the Khopesh
was a one-handed weapon,</i>

29:58.247 --> 30:02.207
but I'm imagining swinging
this long sword with one hand,

30:02.251 --> 30:03.875
and I don't think
it's gonna work,

30:03.919 --> 30:05.585
so I need to stretch
the handle out

30:05.629 --> 30:07.796
so you could fit
two hands on there.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.590
So do you want to fall
towards historical accuracy,

30:10.634 --> 30:14.052
or do you want to give a nod
to modern-day wieldability?

30:14.096 --> 30:16.263
<i>I'm struggling
with making decisions</i>

30:16.306 --> 30:17.973
<i>in the design process,</i>

30:18.017 --> 30:20.642
and it is taking forever
and wearing me down.

30:20.686 --> 30:24.604
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:24.648 --> 30:27.357
<i>- I'm excited about getting
back to the comforts of home</i>

30:27.401 --> 30:30.152
<i>and knock out
a really nice weapon.</i>

30:30.195 --> 30:32.612
<i>Job number one...
It's got to be strong,</i>

30:32.656 --> 30:36.950
because a Khopesh
is the original battle axe.

30:36.994 --> 30:38.618
We're gonna use
the floor of the shop

30:38.662 --> 30:40.912
to get the vision going.

30:40.956 --> 30:42.664
That's what we're gonna build.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.458
Those Egyptians, man...

30:44.501 --> 30:46.084
They had their act together.

30:46.128 --> 30:47.878
I didn't like 'em
wearing dresses,

30:47.921 --> 30:51.006
but other than that,
they seem pretty cool.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.593
Today I would like to get
the profile of the Khopesh done,

30:54.636 --> 30:57.554
and making that first bend
is pretty much

30:57.598 --> 30:59.347
gonna be the moment of truth.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.308
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:01.351 --> 31:03.894
<i>Most weapons, whether it be
a knife or a sword,</i>

31:03.937 --> 31:07.397
<i>is a straight-line draw,
but this has got a bend.</i>

31:07.441 --> 31:09.024
So, once the bend is put there,

31:09.068 --> 31:10.776
you can't straighten it out
and move the bend

31:10.819 --> 31:13.779
because you've compromised
the material too much.

31:13.822 --> 31:16.239
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:16.283 --> 31:20.202
I think it's too long.
I'll shorten it up.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.745
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:21.789 --> 31:25.916
<i>- Last night I was able
to finalize my design.</i>

31:25.959 --> 31:28.335
If I can catch up and forge
my profile this morning,

31:28.378 --> 31:30.253
that'll be great.

31:30.297 --> 31:33.381
I need to restrict my habit
of losing track of the time

31:33.425 --> 31:35.175
<i>when I'm working on something.</i>

31:35.219 --> 31:37.177
<i>I want to make
kind of a distinctive Damascus</i>

31:37.221 --> 31:38.678
<i>for this Khopesh.</i>

31:38.722 --> 31:40.263
<i>It's similar
to what you would term</i>

31:40.307 --> 31:42.182
<i>a "Merovingian twist pattern,"</i>

31:42.226 --> 31:44.017
<i>and it's something
that you might've found</i>

31:44.061 --> 31:48.438
in the ancient swords made
by the Merovingian Franks.

31:48.482 --> 31:49.981
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:50.025 --> 31:51.900
I'm gonna be trying
to twist it up

31:51.944 --> 31:53.443
to make the powdering cooler,

31:53.487 --> 31:55.946
but I've never tried it
with a bar this thick.

31:55.989 --> 31:57.739
<i>This is the difficult part.</i>

31:57.783 --> 31:59.866
<i>I got to twist,
but not past the point</i>

31:59.910 --> 32:02.452
where it's gonna
rip apart on me.

32:02.496 --> 32:08.834
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:08.877 --> 32:10.919
<i>- This morning
I had to go back to the forge,</i>

32:10.963 --> 32:12.671
and I readjusted the blade.

32:12.714 --> 32:14.422
<i>We have a curved blade, right?</i>

32:14.466 --> 32:16.258
<i>Just the sheer weight
of that long of material,</i>

32:16.301 --> 32:18.718
just heating it up
is gonna warp it.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.554
<i>The quench is
the make-or-break moment.</i>

32:20.597 --> 32:22.681
A lot can go wrong.

32:22.724 --> 32:24.099
You know, it's, like,

32:24.143 --> 32:26.601
you guys are gonna hear
either major cussing

32:26.645 --> 32:28.228
or "yippee."

32:28.272 --> 32:29.729
[hissing]

32:29.773 --> 32:32.774
If this warps bad,
I have to start over.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.609
Come on, baby.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.821
I'm afraid to wipe it back
and see if I got it or not.

32:37.865 --> 32:39.447
Yes.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.866
Yippee.

32:40.909 --> 32:43.326
[metal clanking]

32:43.370 --> 32:45.871
- Because I twisted
the steel billet for this blade,

32:45.914 --> 32:49.207
it's possible that it may
untwist in the quench.

32:49.251 --> 32:51.668
I hope I'm not visited
by the Tink Fairy.

32:51.712 --> 32:53.086
Now.

32:53.130 --> 32:55.130
That's when
your blade goes, tink,

32:55.174 --> 32:57.883
and you know it cracked
in the quench.

32:57.926 --> 33:00.927
Fingers crossed.

33:00.971 --> 33:03.054
Oh, that looks pretty good.

33:03.098 --> 33:05.682
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:05.726 --> 33:09.561
<i>- Today we just have to cross
your "T"s and dot your "I"s.</i>

33:09.605 --> 33:11.396
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:11.440 --> 33:13.315
I've sharpened my blade,
I got an edge on it,

33:13.358 --> 33:15.358
and now I'm ready
to go for the test.

33:15.402 --> 33:17.319
Let's see
if this thing will cut.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.238
I've got a piece of lumber
all the way from Japan.

33:20.282 --> 33:25.202
It was grown in an orchard
by a small samurai.

33:25.245 --> 33:27.245
<i>I thought, "One day, Craig,</i>

33:27.289 --> 33:30.582
this lumber will give its life
for you."

33:30.626 --> 33:38.626
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:38.884 --> 33:40.634
There's no damage
to the blade, man.

33:40.677 --> 33:42.219
It looks like that'll do.

33:42.262 --> 33:43.887
<i>I really liked the way
the sword turned out,</i>

33:43.931 --> 33:46.139
and I'm gonna give Salem
a run for his money.

33:46.183 --> 33:49.517
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:49.561 --> 33:52.729
<i>- Yesterday I finished my blade.</i>

33:52.773 --> 33:54.522
I feel like
the two most striking things

33:54.566 --> 33:57.817
about this weapon
are the bold Damascus pattern

33:57.861 --> 33:59.819
<i>and the integral construction.</i>

33:59.863 --> 34:01.905
<i>It's all forged
out of one piece of metal...</i>

34:01.949 --> 34:04.157
Very simple,
but hard to pull off.

34:04.201 --> 34:06.159
Well, I'd hate
to shave my face with it,

34:06.203 --> 34:10.497
but it's pretty darn sharp
for arm hair.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.875
I hope that Craig's Khopesh
turned out really awesome

34:13.919 --> 34:18.004
because my blade deserves
some stiff competition.

34:18.048 --> 34:19.130
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:19.174 --> 34:20.674
Cool.

34:20.717 --> 34:23.718
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:27.266 --> 34:32.352
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:32.396 --> 34:35.355
- Salem, Craig, welcome back.

34:35.399 --> 34:37.065
You had five days
at your home forge

34:37.109 --> 34:38.316
to work on your weapons.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.402
Salem, how did it go?

34:40.445 --> 34:43.196
- So I went with a twist
Damascus blade,

34:43.240 --> 34:44.906
<i>added a different billet to it</i>

34:44.950 --> 34:46.950
<i>to make the contrast
a little bit more interesting.</i>

34:46.994 --> 34:48.827
<i>I made it a two-handed handle,</i>

34:48.870 --> 34:51.037
<i>'cause it's longer
than historical examples.</i>

34:51.081 --> 34:52.914
So that was a little bit
of a gamble.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.749
Hopefully, that works.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.711
- Great.
Craig, how'd it go for you?

34:57.754 --> 34:59.671
- I had a bit of a problem
here and there,

34:59.715 --> 35:02.173
<i>but I got everything together.</i>

35:02.217 --> 35:03.883
<i>You know, you try to calibrate</i>

35:03.927 --> 35:05.427
<i>how long it's gonna take
to make something,</i>

35:05.470 --> 35:07.345
<i>but five days was kind of hard
to get a grasp</i>

35:07.389 --> 35:09.973
of what I could get done
in five days.

35:10.017 --> 35:12.225
- Well, gentlemen,
both of your weapons

35:12.269 --> 35:15.186
look like lethal works of art...

35:15.230 --> 35:18.106
but artistry is not
as important as performance.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.025
We will now be putting
your weapons

35:20.068 --> 35:21.526
through a series of three tests.

35:21.570 --> 35:24.779
First up, the sharpness test.
Doug?

35:24.823 --> 35:26.323
- Bladesmiths, it is said

35:26.366 --> 35:27.907
that the historic design
of the Khopesh

35:27.951 --> 35:29.868
evolved from a battle axe.

35:29.911 --> 35:31.411
Its edge was so sharp
that it is said

35:31.455 --> 35:33.079
it could cut through
just about anything.

35:33.123 --> 35:35.040
To test the sharpness
of your weapon,

35:35.083 --> 35:37.751
I will see how well
it cuts through a sandbag,

35:37.794 --> 35:39.836
sugarcane, and a rope.

35:39.880 --> 35:43.673
Salem, you're up. You ready?
- Yes, sir.

35:43.717 --> 35:45.592
<i>I'm feeling confident
that my blade</i>

35:45.635 --> 35:47.177
<i>will chop well and hold up.</i>

35:47.220 --> 35:49.429
Will it slice things?
That remains to be seen.

35:49.473 --> 35:57.395
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:00.692 --> 36:03.401
<i>The rope...
My blade barely nicked it,</i>

36:03.445 --> 36:06.613
but I'll take two out of three.

36:06.656 --> 36:08.782
- Well, Salem,
it definitely is easy enough

36:08.825 --> 36:10.033
to cut through a sand bag,

36:10.077 --> 36:11.618
<i>cut through sugarcane,</i>

36:11.661 --> 36:14.287
but the forward weight being
a little bit tip heavy,

36:14.331 --> 36:15.622
it was a little bit
harder to slice

36:15.665 --> 36:17.165
through on the upward stroke,

36:17.209 --> 36:19.542
but, definitely,
it's a very sharp weapon.

36:19.586 --> 36:21.503
This, sir, will cut.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.296
Good job.
- Thanks.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.048
- Craig, you're up.
You ready?

36:25.092 --> 36:26.216
- Yes, sir.

36:26.259 --> 36:27.675
<i>Going into the sharpness test,</i>

36:27.719 --> 36:30.804
I feel like I can do
all three of those tests

36:30.847 --> 36:32.347
that I see in front of him,

36:32.391 --> 36:35.725
and I'm excited to see
Doug work the blade.

36:35.769 --> 36:43.691
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:46.571 --> 36:50.490
I'm just disappointed
that it wouldn't cut the rope.

36:50.534 --> 36:53.159
- Well, Craig,
it cut through a sandbag.

36:53.203 --> 36:55.245
It cut all the way
through three sugarcanes,

36:55.288 --> 36:56.496
but the same idea...

36:56.540 --> 36:58.248
On an upward swing for the test,

36:58.291 --> 37:01.543
it did lacerate the rope,
but it didn't cut through.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.336
But overall...

37:03.380 --> 37:05.588
it will cut.

37:05.632 --> 37:08.716
Now it's time to move on
to the kill test.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.428
To test the functionality
and lethality for a blade,

37:11.471 --> 37:13.513
I will attempt
to rip off the shields,

37:13.557 --> 37:16.266
then deliver killing blows
on this ballistic dummy.

37:16.309 --> 37:18.226
Let's see how much damage
your weapon can do.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.561
Salem, you're up.
Are you ready?

37:19.604 --> 37:21.354
- All right.

37:21.398 --> 37:22.772
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

37:22.816 --> 37:24.941
My heart's pounding pretty good.

37:24.985 --> 37:26.651
<i>I'm a little nervous,
but mostly,</i>

37:26.695 --> 37:29.112
I'm just excited
to see him, you know,

37:29.156 --> 37:30.905
go berserk with this thing.

37:30.949 --> 37:38.872
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:42.210 --> 37:43.418
- The hook on your tip

37:43.462 --> 37:46.045
does allow
to rip off the shield.

37:46.089 --> 37:49.340
The edge you have right here
caused some serious damage...

37:51.386 --> 37:53.678
Enough to cut all the way
through the belly here.

37:53.722 --> 37:57.223
At the same time, I've cut
through all these bones,

37:57.267 --> 37:59.559
from the clavicle
through the ribs.

37:59.603 --> 38:01.561
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:01.605 --> 38:05.732
This, sir, will kill.

38:05.775 --> 38:07.901
Craig, it's your turn.
You ready?

38:07.944 --> 38:09.861
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

38:09.905 --> 38:17.827
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:21.458 --> 38:22.999
- Well, Craig, what I like

38:23.043 --> 38:25.502
about your particular
hook design over here

38:25.545 --> 38:28.505
is that as you puncture, twist,
and rip out,

38:28.548 --> 38:30.006
everything that you have
in there

38:30.050 --> 38:31.930
will hook and come out with it.

38:31.968 --> 38:35.094
The edge cut all the way
into the bone

38:35.138 --> 38:37.138
and broke these ribs,
the sternum.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.682
This, sir, will kill.

38:39.726 --> 38:41.017
- Thank you.

38:41.061 --> 38:42.894
We're pretty much going at it.

38:42.938 --> 38:45.271
It's tit for tat
the whole way through.

38:45.315 --> 38:46.981
- Next up is the strength test.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.441
Dave?

38:48.485 --> 38:49.901
- Gentlemen,
what I'm gonna do to test

38:49.945 --> 38:51.486
the strength of your weapons

38:51.530 --> 38:54.197
is take seven blows
against these animal femurs.

38:54.241 --> 38:55.448
Salem, you're up.

38:55.492 --> 38:57.784
Are you ready?
- Great.

38:57.827 --> 38:59.661
- Now, Salem,
in examining your weapon,

38:59.704 --> 39:04.415
we noticed a small delamination
on the back of the blade.

39:04.459 --> 39:05.875
<i>- I was not expecting that.</i>

39:05.919 --> 39:08.044
I'm just hoping
that the edge stays hard.

39:08.088 --> 39:10.880
- So we're gonna keep an eye
on that through the testing,

39:10.924 --> 39:13.716
and we'll see if it opens up.

39:13.760 --> 39:21.683
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:25.230 --> 39:26.771
[exhales sharply]

39:26.815 --> 39:30.358
Well, Salem, that did a job
on those bones.

39:30.402 --> 39:33.069
Now, there's a little bit
of deflection on your blade,

39:33.113 --> 39:36.906
but that back mark didn't open
or split at all.

39:36.950 --> 39:40.285
Now, you can see I went
through two of those bones

39:40.328 --> 39:42.745
and was well into the third.

39:42.789 --> 39:44.414
Well done.
- Thank you.

39:44.457 --> 39:46.666
- So, Craig, it's your turn.

39:46.710 --> 39:48.334
You ready?
- Let's do it.

39:48.378 --> 39:50.420
Salem's blade just
smokes right through it.

39:50.463 --> 39:51.796
<i>I got to keep par.</i>

39:51.840 --> 39:53.881
I got to be able to do
the same thing.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.676
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:01.141 --> 40:03.474
- So, Craig, it's your turn.

40:03.518 --> 40:05.184
You ready?
- Let's do it.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.521
- All right.

40:08.565 --> 40:16.487
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:23.830 --> 40:26.581
[exhales sharply]

40:26.625 --> 40:29.667
Well, Craig,
you can see a lot of chips

40:29.711 --> 40:32.003
right there in the impact zone.

40:32.047 --> 40:34.172
The first few blows
against those femurs,

40:34.215 --> 40:37.091
it start cutting really nicely,
broke through the one,

40:37.135 --> 40:39.385
but as we started
to lose edge here,

40:39.429 --> 40:41.429
<i>with those chips
and deflections,</i>

40:41.473 --> 40:42.889
it just stopped cutting.

40:42.932 --> 40:46.392
It was more
of a bludgeoning impact blow.

40:46.436 --> 40:49.937
But I felt it really cut well
when I was swinging it.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.856
All in all, nice design...

40:51.900 --> 40:53.650
I like
your handle construction...

40:53.693 --> 40:55.985
And it's definitely a chopper.

40:56.029 --> 40:58.988
So, gentlemen, good job.

40:59.032 --> 41:02.492
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:02.535 --> 41:05.411
- Salem, Craig,
in just five days,

41:05.455 --> 41:08.081
you have both delivered
your own unique versions

41:08.124 --> 41:10.500
of the Egyptian Khopesh.

41:10.543 --> 41:12.377
But in this arena
of competition,

41:12.420 --> 41:15.713
there can only be one winner.

41:15.757 --> 41:17.340
J.

41:17.384 --> 41:19.550
- Well, Salem, I love
that twist-pattern Damascus

41:19.594 --> 41:22.220
you put into your blade...
Nice and tight.

41:22.263 --> 41:24.347
<i>It looks really great,
but there is an issue.</i>

41:24.391 --> 41:27.058
<i>You do have
a couple delaminations.</i>

41:27.102 --> 41:28.643
Between that and some
of the chipping

41:28.687 --> 41:30.436
that showed up
during the strength test,

41:30.480 --> 41:33.106
those are concerns I have.

41:33.149 --> 41:34.691
- Doug.

41:34.734 --> 41:37.860
- Craig, your Khopesh design
is made for killing.

41:37.904 --> 41:40.029
The billet you have there
not only cuts,

41:40.073 --> 41:42.323
<i>but it crushes bone.</i>

41:42.367 --> 41:44.659
<i>Having said that,
it's that very heavy balance</i>

41:44.703 --> 41:46.703
on the blade
that makes it very hard

41:46.746 --> 41:49.914
to control
with a smaller handle.

41:49.958 --> 41:52.500
- Bladesmiths...

41:52.544 --> 41:54.502
you've both done fantastic work,

41:54.546 --> 41:57.922
but there can only be
one "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:57.966 --> 42:02.510
<i>¶ ¶</i>

42:02.554 --> 42:05.805
Salem, you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

42:05.849 --> 42:07.640
Congratulations.

42:07.684 --> 42:09.225
- Good job.
- Thank you.

42:09.269 --> 42:11.477
Good job to you too.

42:11.521 --> 42:15.189
- Craig, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.817
- Craig, there were a few
little things that added up...

42:17.861 --> 42:21.487
The shape of the handle,
the weight being so far forward.

42:21.531 --> 42:25.116
But what really hurt you
were those chips in the blade.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.285
- Craig, please
surrender your weapon.

42:27.328 --> 42:29.787
<i>¶ ¶</i>

42:29.831 --> 42:31.539
- Craig, thank you, man.

42:31.583 --> 42:35.251
- This experience was harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

42:35.295 --> 42:37.170
I need about
three gin and tonics...

42:37.213 --> 42:38.838
[voice breaking]
And I'm just gonna make

42:38.882 --> 42:41.549
the bad man in the back
of my head go away.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.718
- Salem, it's safe to smile now

42:43.762 --> 42:45.261
because you're
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

42:45.305 --> 42:47.513
and the recipient of $10,000.

42:47.557 --> 42:48.723
Congratulations.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.559
[applause]

42:51.603 --> 42:53.394
- The fullers on that blade

42:53.438 --> 42:55.021
just really
bring that pattern out.

42:55.064 --> 42:57.648
I think that's
a really nice touch.

42:57.692 --> 42:59.609
- It's just crazy.

42:59.652 --> 43:01.903
It's gonna take a while
to sink in.

43:01.946 --> 43:03.279
I'm kind of stunned right now.

43:03.323 --> 43:09.660
