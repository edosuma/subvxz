00:02.289 --> 00:03.903
When I thought you weren't coming, I...

00:03.928 --> 00:05.547
I left you a voice mail.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.039
You mean the one where you belittled me

00:07.064 --> 00:08.560
and told me to grow the hell up?

00:08.585 --> 00:09.775
You know what, Randall, you still have

00:09.800 --> 00:10.976
that cot at your office?

00:11.001 --> 00:12.359
You should go sleep on it.

00:13.343 --> 00:15.080
I'm not sleeping in Philadelphia, Beth.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.283
We can't keep simmering
like this forever.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.015
Fine. You want to do this right now?

00:19.109 --> 00:21.110
Let's do this. Close the door.

00:26.679 --> 00:29.421
- Beth, if you think you...
- No. Mm-mm. Me first.

00:31.181 --> 00:32.981
I am looking at you right now,

00:33.006 --> 00:34.643
but I don't even recognize you.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.102
Because my husband,
the man that I married,

00:37.203 --> 00:38.820
would never talk to me the way

00:38.845 --> 00:40.953
that you did on that voice mail, ever.

00:40.978 --> 00:42.109
I know.

00:42.713 --> 00:44.023
And I'm sorry.

00:44.195 --> 00:45.882
That message was a gross misstep.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.056
A misstep? Randall,
your Coogi sweater phase

00:48.081 --> 00:49.148
in college, that's a misstep.

00:49.173 --> 00:50.312
Okay? What you said...

00:50.337 --> 00:51.492
What-what were your exact words?

00:51.517 --> 00:54.320
That I teach
"bored housewives how to twirl"?

00:54.345 --> 00:55.445
I didn't mean it.

00:55.470 --> 00:56.632
I was just...

00:57.796 --> 00:59.523
I was trying to hurt your feelings.

00:59.548 --> 01:01.039
I thought you were
standing me up, and I...

01:01.064 --> 01:02.598
Why would I stand you up?

01:02.837 --> 01:05.138
When have I ever not had your back?

01:07.481 --> 01:08.750
Never.

01:10.992 --> 01:12.835
But if we're being honest, Beth,

01:12.860 --> 01:15.843
our rhythm has been off.

01:16.187 --> 01:17.515
All right? It's been off for months.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.304
No, no. My rhythm is fine;
your rhythm is off.

01:20.804 --> 01:22.839
And it's off because you're not
getting what you want.

01:22.864 --> 01:24.965
- I'm not getting what I want?
- No. Because I refuse

01:24.990 --> 01:27.023
to give up my own life
to accommodate yours.

01:27.048 --> 01:28.726
I've never asked... Oh, my...

01:32.094 --> 01:33.718
I am killing myself

01:33.743 --> 01:36.406
driving to Philly and back every day.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.187
If I'm lucky, I get a chance

01:38.212 --> 01:39.859
to catch the girls
before they go to bed.

01:40.196 --> 01:44.421
If not, then I'm stuck sleeping
on a pull-out in my office.

01:44.929 --> 01:47.976
I'm not even sworn in yet, Beth,
and I am already swamped.

01:48.001 --> 01:51.132
But I still make it back
for your dance recital.

01:51.325 --> 01:53.273
And I still make it home
to watch the girls

01:53.298 --> 01:54.921
every time you have an evening class,

01:54.946 --> 01:57.562
because I want you
to have your own life.

01:57.587 --> 01:58.898
No, you don't.

01:59.076 --> 02:00.992
You just realized
I'm not gonna stop teaching,

02:01.017 --> 02:02.851
but you are definitely not on board.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.750
No, no. For the past 20 years,
I have stood by your side

02:06.775 --> 02:09.639
through every whim, every pipe dream,

02:09.664 --> 02:11.992
every flight of fancy
that you can think of.

02:12.017 --> 02:14.385
And for the first time, the first time,

02:14.864 --> 02:16.390
I have a flight of fancy.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.129
Something that I want.

02:18.262 --> 02:20.750
And still, it becomes about you.

02:21.810 --> 02:26.000

05:56.069 --> 05:58.271
No. What made you think that?

06:02.138 --> 06:04.554
Well, you got some bad Intel.

Like, if someone put on some
<i>Miseducation of Lauryn Hill right now,</i>

06:13.896 --> 06:15.196
you wouldn't cut a rug?

06:16.563 --> 06:19.296
(LAUGHS) Okay. Um, well, first of all,

06:19.664 --> 06:22.992
you don't dance to Lauryn Hill;
you groove.

06:23.087 --> 06:25.898
And secondly, who says "cut a rug"?

06:25.923 --> 06:27.437
A lot of people say "cut a rug."

06:27.765 --> 06:28.914
White people.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.453
Well, I was raised by white people.

06:32.881 --> 06:34.085
I'm adopted.

06:35.492 --> 06:36.859
You'd be surprised how hard that is

06:36.884 --> 06:38.351
to ease in the conversation.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.601
Mm. Yeah, I didn't know.

06:43.142 --> 06:44.960
Well, maybe you should
have asked around about me.

06:50.929 --> 06:54.171
I was dropped off at a
fire station the day I was born.

06:54.689 --> 06:57.234
And a fireman brought me to a hospital,

06:57.648 --> 06:59.601
and my dad convinced my mom to adopt me.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.875
He died earlier this year.

(CHUCKLING): My dad.

07:11.024 --> 07:12.492
It was a heart attack, and...

07:19.050 --> 07:20.250
I'm sorry, Beth.

07:20.534 --> 07:21.710
Uh...

07:22.898 --> 07:24.171
I'm not used to saying that...

07:25.255 --> 07:26.687
out loud yet. I'm sorry.

07:29.864 --> 07:31.070
Um...

07:31.676 --> 07:34.726
Uh, my dad passed away last year.

07:35.906 --> 07:37.593
He was sick for a while,

07:37.618 --> 07:40.781
but it still felt so sudden.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.367
Yeah.

07:48.966 --> 07:50.398
I think we're ready to order.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.627

07:52.652 --> 07:54.609
if you could pay for your meal first.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.395
Um, is there something wrong?

08:00.812 --> 08:02.804

08:04.343 --> 08:06.921
Well, did-did all these people
pay for their meal in advance,

08:06.946 --> 08:09.210
or is that policy just for us?

08:09.235 --> 08:10.812
Beth, it's fine.

08:11.143 --> 08:12.781
You know, we probably just, you know,

08:12.806 --> 08:14.984
look a little young to be here, I guess.

08:15.009 --> 08:17.543

hand over your check

08:37.235 --> 08:39.460
- like that was okay.
- Of course it isn't okay,

08:39.485 --> 08:41.625
but I-I didn't want to ruin the date.

08:42.710 --> 08:45.054

you're a very nice guy,

08:45.079 --> 08:47.242

08:53.368 --> 08:56.270

08:56.574 --> 08:57.812
What do you mean?

08:59.885 --> 09:04.367
Um, you want to know what
my idea of the perfect date is?

09:04.980 --> 09:06.179
It's nachos.

09:06.204 --> 09:08.062
It's-it's ginger beer and nachos.

09:14.548 --> 09:17.304

Aren't you hot?

09:17.329 --> 09:18.890
I mean, it's a little hot, yeah, but...

09:18.915 --> 09:20.515
Then take off the stupid jacket.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.796
It's not a stupid jacket.

09:23.846 --> 09:25.148
You're trying to start a fight with me,

09:25.173 --> 09:26.640
but I don't want to fight with you.

09:27.252 --> 09:29.109
I-I grew up in a house
with parents who didn't fight.

09:29.134 --> 09:30.804
I... I mean,

09:31.461 --> 09:33.171
Th-they-they fought once.

09:33.196 --> 09:34.764
It-it was actually pretty rough.

09:34.789 --> 09:36.781
I came home early
and watched the entire thing...

09:36.806 --> 09:38.330
Okay, Randall, I've known you
for ten minutes.

09:38.355 --> 09:40.070
Just... stop telling me this stuff.

- Beth.

and I-I wore it because I wanted
to look nice for you.

09:52.877 --> 09:54.835
These flowers?
I didn't know what you'd like,

09:54.860 --> 09:56.296

(OVERLAPPING ARGUING)

31:36.555 --> 31:38.196
KEVIN: You're scared.
You look scared to me.

31:38.221 --> 31:39.548
- WILLIAM: Oh, boy.
- I'll take your money.

31:39.573 --> 31:40.587
RANDALL: Go get him.

31:41.838 --> 31:43.782
How far away does Annie's friend live?

31:43.886 --> 31:45.228
- We're almost there.
- Hmm.

31:45.253 --> 31:46.298
(PHONE CHIMES)

31:47.537 --> 31:48.829
RANDALL: Oh, you know how to text?

31:50.585 --> 31:52.728
- I'm dying. I'm not a hundred.
- (CHUCKLES)

31:53.735 --> 31:55.064
Jesse's trying to get me to go

31:55.089 --> 31:56.931
to this Charles Lloyd concert tonight,

31:56.956 --> 31:58.756
but the show doesn't start till 9:00.

31:59.415 --> 32:01.110
Well, I know we run
a tight ship, William,

32:01.135 --> 32:02.845
but it's okay for you
to stay out past curfew.

32:02.870 --> 32:05.493
Well, thank you, but these things
end late, and I don't want

32:05.518 --> 32:07.454
to have to spend the night at his place.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.837
The man's apartment is freezing.

32:11.575 --> 32:12.860
Why don't you just ask him,

32:12.885 --> 32:14.939
"Hey, Jesse, mind if we
turn on the heat?"

32:14.964 --> 32:18.025
Nah, I don't want him to have to
change his routine on account of me.

32:18.050 --> 32:20.853
It's easier if I just make
an excuse not to stay over.

32:20.986 --> 32:23.220
No, man, it's easier to talk to him.

32:23.383 --> 32:25.853
You know, me and Beth,
we don't sit on stuff.

32:25.878 --> 32:27.110
We talk to each other.

32:27.282 --> 32:29.450
Nothing beats honest,
open communication.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.816
Okay, Uncle Phil. I'll think on it.

32:32.026 --> 32:33.923
Oh, we making <i>Fresh Prince</i>
<i>references now, huh?</i>

32:33.948 --> 32:36.282
- How old do you actually think I am?
- (BOTH LAUGH)

32:37.202 --> 32:38.321
Hey, pull over.

32:38.726 --> 32:41.394
I want to get some more syrup
for them leftover pancakes.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.540
Might have it for dinner.

32:42.565 --> 32:43.696
Right on.

32:45.501 --> 32:46.814
Maybe down here, son.

32:46.839 --> 32:47.923
Yeah.

32:52.390 --> 32:53.509
Beth?

32:57.271 --> 32:58.665
Why aren't you in Hershey?

33:00.923 --> 33:02.110
I, uh...

33:03.985 --> 33:05.939
I'm gonna go find that syrup.

33:06.483 --> 33:08.915
Give you a chance to do some
of that great communicating

33:08.940 --> 33:10.251
you're so proud of.

33:13.194 --> 33:15.376
- What are you doing here?
- Buying syrup.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.501
What are you doing here?

33:18.539 --> 33:19.840
Don't jump to conclusions.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.306
- It's not what you think.
- Swedish Fish.

33:21.331 --> 33:23.509
What, you stopping at the movies
on your way to Hershey?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.790
That doesn't explain
that bottle of wine.

33:25.815 --> 33:28.509
- Randall, I...
- Or did you make up a conference

33:28.534 --> 33:30.587
so you could secretly
check into a hotel for the night

33:30.612 --> 33:32.126
to watch movies
and drink that bottle of wine

33:32.151 --> 33:34.634
- and eat Swedish Fish?
- Damn, that's impressive.

33:34.659 --> 33:35.915
What the hell, Beth?

33:35.940 --> 33:38.900
I just needed 24 hours to myself.

33:40.557 --> 33:43.275
Away from biological fathers
and white brothers.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.579
And don't get me wrong, I adore them.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.275
I adore William.

33:47.736 --> 33:48.876
I tolerate Kevin.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.587
But it's a lot.

33:51.770 --> 33:52.900
So I lied.

33:53.348 --> 33:56.767
I just needed 24 hours.

33:57.042 --> 33:59.032
Not to be a wife and a mother

33:59.057 --> 34:01.196
and a caretaker and a housekeeper.

34:01.221 --> 34:03.735
I just... I just want to be a woman

34:03.760 --> 34:06.556
who sleeps in a big-ass
hotel bed and watches movies

34:06.581 --> 34:09.985
and-and reruns of <i>Living Single</i>
<i>from my iPad</i>

34:10.429 --> 34:12.532
in my big-ass Jacuzzi tub, and I...

34:12.556 --> 34:14.610
Okay, I get it.

34:15.492 --> 34:18.087
- There's a lot going on in our house.
- Yes.

34:18.775 --> 34:20.907
But if you needed space,
why not just ask for it...

34:20.931 --> 34:22.126
I have asked!

34:23.690 --> 34:24.969
I have asked.

34:25.335 --> 34:28.275
And the last time I asked,
it became a one-act play

34:28.300 --> 34:29.603
about "what's wrong"

34:29.628 --> 34:31.775
and-and "why do I need a day alone?"

34:32.273 --> 34:34.150
By the time I convinced you
it was nothing bigger,

34:34.175 --> 34:37.377
the day was over,
and it was... I was exhausted.

34:37.590 --> 34:40.141
I wouldn't have been awake to
watch a single <i>Living Single.</i>

34:44.630 --> 34:47.047
I-I'm sorry. I love you.

34:47.072 --> 34:49.532
- I feel terrible that I lied.
- I don't want you to feel

34:49.556 --> 34:50.829
like you have to run away from us.

34:50.853 --> 34:54.790
I don't. I swear. There's just
a lot of men living in my house.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.297
And I broke.

34:58.261 --> 34:59.602
(BETH CRYING)

35:05.871 --> 35:07.001
Okay.

35:07.417 --> 35:11.095
- All right, go enjoy your 24 hours.
- (LAUGHS)

35:15.670 --> 35:18.212
Uh, will you just answer me one thing?

35:20.004 --> 35:22.032
What episode of <i>Living Single</i>
<i>are you gonna start with?</i>

35:23.789 --> 35:25.823
The one where Max and Kyle
sleep together

35:25.848 --> 35:28.384
and wake up in the La-Z-Boy
all freaked out.

35:28.409 --> 35:29.735
- I love that episode.
- (LAUGHS)

35:30.623 --> 35:33.728
Hey, you remember when Obie
brought Kyle Max's suede pump,

35:33.753 --> 35:37.103
and Kyle was like, "And to think
I actually drank out of this."

35:37.230 --> 35:38.423
(BOTH LAUGHING)

35:39.357 --> 35:40.993
That was so nasty.

35:42.001 --> 35:43.923
RANDALL (LAUGHING): Oh, man.

35:43.948 --> 35:45.782
Well, now I don't want
to watch it without you.

35:46.907 --> 35:48.454
Go. What are you talking about?

35:49.074 --> 35:50.212
No.

35:51.175 --> 35:52.520
I'm coming home.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.621
Go get William's syrup.

35:54.673 --> 35:56.384
Tell him the one that he likes
is in aisle four.

35:56.409 --> 35:57.609
Are you sure?

35:57.770 --> 35:59.404
'Cause I don't mind you having your day.

35:59.429 --> 36:00.556
I'm sure.

36:02.378 --> 36:04.017
And Kevin's out of toilet paper.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.837
He likes the lavender-scented one.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.103
Pick up the lavender-scented one.

36:07.171 --> 36:08.267
I'm on it.

36:15.822 --> 36:18.431
I am tired of having this fight.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.275
We have been having the same
fight ever since we met.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.978
I don't want to be swallowed up by you,

36:24.003 --> 36:26.509
and then you sweet-talk me and
do whatever the hell you want.

36:27.345 --> 36:29.406
You have turned me into your mother.

36:29.431 --> 36:30.548
Beth, don't bring my mother into this.

36:30.573 --> 36:31.829
Well, she's already in it.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.751
You don't even realize it,
but they're both in it.

36:37.311 --> 36:38.907
Admit that you think

36:38.932 --> 36:41.142
that your job
is more important than mine.

36:41.602 --> 36:43.181
- That's absurd.
- Admit it.

36:43.690 --> 36:46.329
Admit to me that you hated the fact

36:46.360 --> 36:48.610
that I had something happening
for myself.

36:48.635 --> 36:50.212
- JACK: I hated that you lied
- REBECCA: No.

36:50.237 --> 36:51.689
about working with your ex-boyfriend.

36:51.714 --> 36:52.881
<i>REBECCA: No, that's total BS, Jack.</i>

36:52.906 --> 36:54.532
Come on, Randall, admit it.

36:54.557 --> 36:55.610
No.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.576
I will not be bullied into
saying something

36:57.601 --> 36:59.290
even more awful to you.

36:59.946 --> 37:03.032
I will not speak that way
to you. I won't do it.

37:03.094 --> 37:04.243
No. You didn't want me to have a career.

37:04.268 --> 37:06.164
- Career? You are a 40-year-old woman
- Yes career.

37:06.189 --> 37:09.439
singing covers in pubs.
That is not a career, Rebecca.

37:09.464 --> 37:10.876
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

37:11.535 --> 37:13.353
We made a promise to one another

37:14.198 --> 37:17.150
that we would never get lost
in each other,

37:17.175 --> 37:18.709
and I broke that promise.

37:20.837 --> 37:22.126
And you let me.

37:22.528 --> 37:27.992
You have let me bend to your
every need time and time again.

37:28.017 --> 37:30.703
Oh, we have kids,
I have to step back from my job.

37:30.728 --> 37:33.181
You quit your job, I work overtime.

37:33.206 --> 37:36.126
You have a dream of buying
your father's building,

37:36.151 --> 37:37.618
it becomes my dream, too.

37:37.643 --> 37:40.204
You run for city councilman,
I stand by your side.

37:40.229 --> 37:42.689
You win city councilman, now what?

37:43.013 --> 37:44.980
I'm supposed to give up what I love

37:45.237 --> 37:46.892
to become a politician's wife?

37:46.938 --> 37:49.673
How many dinners am I supposed
to go to, Randall? And how long?

37:50.626 --> 37:52.882
And what if city council isn't enough?

37:52.907 --> 37:54.431
- What then?
- That's not what I want.

37:54.456 --> 37:57.091
No, I finally have something;
I have something

37:57.116 --> 38:00.767
that I have been looking for
longer than I knew,

38:00.868 --> 38:03.618
and I am not going to give that up.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.642
I am not going to bend.

38:10.156 --> 38:11.650
And that's the problem.

38:12.925 --> 38:16.548
Our lives don't work
unless I'm doing the bending.

38:17.707 --> 38:18.728
It doesn't.

38:20.274 --> 38:21.681
And we both know it.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.790
No, please. I... (SIGHS)

38:40.921 --> 38:42.833
I can see your mind working

38:42.858 --> 38:45.632
and-and you looking
for the perfect words

38:45.657 --> 38:47.311
to make this better,
and I don't want that.

38:47.336 --> 38:48.454
I don't want it.

38:49.134 --> 38:50.775
Because you're too good at it.

38:51.376 --> 38:53.618
You're unbelievable at it, in fact.

38:53.643 --> 38:55.298
And you say the right speech

38:55.323 --> 38:57.423
and have the whole world eating
out of your palm.

38:57.519 --> 38:58.860
Me, especially.

39:06.926 --> 39:08.008
(BETH SIGHS)

39:08.385 --> 39:11.478
No. No, I don't accept that, Beth.

39:11.503 --> 39:14.047
I'm not... I'm not going along
with this revisionist history.

39:14.072 --> 39:15.973
Revisionist history? Okay...

39:15.998 --> 39:19.674
Okay, in what universe
have I been steamrolling you

39:19.699 --> 39:21.204
for the past 20 years?

39:21.985 --> 39:23.562
I mean, your whole persona

39:23.587 --> 39:26.548
is driven by you being
the head of this family.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.708
So I'm-a ask you again:
in what ridiculous universe

39:29.733 --> 39:33.157
are you this wallflower that's
just been steamrolled by me?

39:33.182 --> 39:34.915
And these are not my words, Beth.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.368
This is your M.O.

39:36.525 --> 39:39.156
So, please, please do not self-protect

39:39.181 --> 39:41.098
- by putting this on me.
- That is not what I'm doing.

39:41.123 --> 39:42.501
The hell it's not.

39:43.196 --> 39:44.777
I refuse to be blamed for the fact

39:44.802 --> 39:47.838
that you had your awakening
20 years too late.

39:48.103 --> 39:49.859
At any other point in our marriage,

39:49.884 --> 39:51.915
if you had decided
you wanted to go back to dance,

39:51.940 --> 39:53.930
I would have been
nothing but supportive.

39:53.955 --> 39:55.337
Oh, so when would I have done that, huh?

39:55.362 --> 39:57.228
Between which of your anxiety attacks?

40:07.673 --> 40:09.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:09.712 --> 40:11.165
I shouldn't have s... I...
