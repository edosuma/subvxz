00:03.876 --> 00:05.292
So, Jessie,

00:06.042 --> 00:07.542
what do you think?

00:07.584 --> 00:09.250
- I think this
- is amazing!

00:09.292 --> 00:10.334
So, that's a yes?

00:10.375 --> 00:12.209
It's also really sudden!

00:12.250 --> 00:13.417
So, that's a no?

00:13.459 --> 00:14.938
No! I mean, it's just

00:14.939 --> 00:16.417
amazingly sudden!

00:16.459 --> 00:17.626
And suddenly amazing!

00:18.709 --> 00:20.042
Am I babbling?

00:20.083 --> 00:21.230
(CHUCKLES) A little,

00:21.231 --> 00:22.375
but you're really cute

00:20.083 --> 00:22.375
doing it.

00:22.417 --> 00:23.626
(CHUCKLES)

00:23.667 --> 00:25.647
Brooks, I'm flattered

00:25.648 --> 00:27.626
and thrilled,

00:27.667 --> 00:29.351
- but, we've only - known each other
- A few months.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.209
Hey, it's okay,

00:31.210 --> 00:33.042
I know it's

00:29.375 --> 00:33.042
a huge decision,

00:33.083 --> 00:34.351
- so if you need - some time to
- Think it over...

00:34.375 --> 00:35.709
Yes, some time.

00:35.710 --> 00:37.042
Perfect. Thank you.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.834
- Great, I'll be back
- in five minutes.

00:38.876 --> 00:40.500
What?

00:40.542 --> 00:41.834
- (CHUCKLES)
- I'm kidding.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.000
(SIGHS) Oh...

00:47.083 --> 00:48.042
I love you.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.083
I love you, too.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.042
Whoa!

01:00.083 --> 01:02.063
A dimly lit room

01:02.064 --> 01:04.042
filled with flower

01:00.083 --> 01:04.042
petals.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.542
This must be what

01:05.543 --> 01:07.000
the inside of Emma's

01:04.083 --> 01:07.000
brain looks like.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.272

glitter and shoes.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.459

No. No, let's just say...

01:21.083 --> 01:23.063
Bertram's bathroom is

I needed more time

to decide.

02:52.834 --> 02:53.939

- We could have
- told you that.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.810
- Do you guys want to try
- carving a pumpkin?

03:36.834 --> 03:38.143
- It'll definitely be
- better than mine.

03:38.167 --> 03:39.334

03:39.335 --> 03:40.500

- carry around gloves?

when you're about to

enter a nail danger zone.

- Or if Luke touched
- a doorknob before you.

Jessie, this is Farfel.

is through her rodent.

(CHUCKLES)

04:11.083 --> 04:12.563
Then, when Zoey

04:12.564 --> 04:14.042
is putty in my hands,

04:14.083 --> 04:15.563
I will propose

04:15.564 --> 04:17.041
we go on a date.

04:14.083 --> 04:17.041
Whoa!

04:17.083 --> 04:18.397
What is it with all

the proposals lately?

04:20.750 --> 04:21.938
Uh, Jessie,

04:21.939 --> 04:23.125
is everything okay?

04:23.167 --> 04:24.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

04:24.335 --> 04:25.500
I'm fine.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.125
Why... Why do you ask?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.334
Because your face

04:29.335 --> 04:30.500
looks like this.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.876
Wow, you are good.

04:38.918 --> 04:40.718
- I should really get
- that mole checked out.

04:44.292 --> 04:45.668
Wow, look what

04:45.669 --> 04:47.042
they're doing for

04:44.292 --> 04:47.042
the Halloween festival.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.688
Hey, they're having

04:48.689 --> 04:50.292
a pumpkin carving contest!

04:50.334 --> 04:51.563
And first prize

04:51.564 --> 04:52.792
is a tiara?

04:52.834 --> 04:53.918
I should go over there now

04:53.919 --> 04:55.000
and give them my head

04:52.834 --> 04:55.000
measurements.

04:57.292 --> 04:59.168
So, Luke,

04:59.169 --> 05:01.042
want to go to

04:57.292 --> 05:01.042
the Haunted House?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.042
Or are you scared?

05:03.083 --> 05:05.042
Me? Scared?

05:05.083 --> 05:07.000
- I don't even know
- the meaning of the word.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.521
Considering your

05:08.522 --> 05:10.000
terrible vocab scores,

05:07.042 --> 05:10.000
that's a real possibility.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.125
So...

05:14.667 --> 05:16.042
Jessie,

05:16.083 --> 05:17.268
- have you made
- a decision yet?

05:17.292 --> 05:19.042
I still don't know.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.563
I mean,

05:20.564 --> 05:22.042
we're both so young.

05:19.083 --> 05:22.042
I'm 22, you're 25...

05:22.083 --> 05:23.959
- Yeah, but we're both
- animal lovers.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.022
So, we're like 150

05:25.023 --> 05:26.042
in dog years.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.813
Look, I just...

05:28.814 --> 05:30.250
I wanna make sure that

05:27.375 --> 05:30.250
we consider everything.

05:30.292 --> 05:32.042
You know like...

05:32.083 --> 05:34.059
- I kinda wish you - and the kids got along
- A little better.

- Oh, what do you mean?
- The kids love me!

07:40.083 --> 07:41.918
- If it helps,
- they have corndogs.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.600
- It always helps
- if they have corndogs!

07:45.876 --> 07:47.001
Uh, Ravi,

07:47.002 --> 07:48.125
just so you know,

07:48.167 --> 07:50.042
this festival isn't really

07:50.083 --> 07:51.083
a "bring your own

07:51.084 --> 07:52.083
dead hamster"

07:50.083 --> 07:52.083
kind of shindig.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.959
No.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.460
Like Dr. Frankenstein,

07:56.461 --> 07:57.918
I shall use electricity

07:57.959 --> 07:59.021
to bring the dead

07:59.022 --> 08:00.083
back to life.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.230
I shall harness

08:02.231 --> 08:04.334
lightning via a kite,

08:00.125 --> 08:04.334
and re-direct it to Farfel,

08:04.375 --> 08:05.751
thus reanimating

08:05.752 --> 08:07.125
his little heart.

08:07.167 --> 08:09.084
This is why you have

08:09.085 --> 08:11.000
to babysit hamsters

08:07.167 --> 08:11.000
to get girls.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.042
Hey, Luke,

08:14.083 --> 08:15.730
while Dr. Dorkenstein

08:15.731 --> 08:17.375
is flying his kite,

08:17.417 --> 08:18.668
want to go into

08:18.669 --> 08:19.918
the Haunted House?

08:19.959 --> 08:21.210
Those kids back there

08:21.211 --> 08:22.459
gave it two severed

08:19.959 --> 08:22.459
thumbs up.

08:24.584 --> 08:26.042
No, thanks.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.209
It looks lame.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.959
(SCREAMING)

08:31.083 --> 08:32.250
- (WHINING)
- Super lame.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.542
Every time you lie,

08:35.543 --> 08:37.000
your hump grows a little.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.208
How can you date a guy

08:41.210 --> 08:43.250
who killed my pumpkin

08:39.167 --> 08:43.250
and Ravi's hamster?

08:43.292 --> 08:45.042
- You're blinded
- by his pretty face.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.083
I'm not.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.147
He's sweet

08:47.148 --> 08:48.167
and thoughtful

08:48.209 --> 08:49.564
and always knows

08:49.565 --> 08:50.918
exactly what to say to

08:48.209 --> 08:50.918
make my heart melt.

08:52.292 --> 08:55.000
Hmm. Corndog good.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.000
Yep. He's a charmer.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.188
Hey, Luke.

09:03.189 --> 09:04.250
I got us tickets

09:02.125 --> 09:04.250
or the Haunted House.

09:04.292 --> 09:05.602
- But...
- You can thank me later.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.375

09:07.417 --> 09:08.980

09:13.000 --> 09:15.042
That is your evil giggle.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.292
What are you up to?

09:16.334 --> 09:17.709
I told Brooks

09:17.710 --> 09:19.083
he can win

09:16.334 --> 09:19.083
Luke over

09:19.125 --> 09:20.334
by taking him into

09:20.335 --> 09:21.542
the Haunted House.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.542

09:21.584 --> 09:23.083

09:24.667 --> 09:27.584

09:27.626 --> 09:29.125
(SCREAMING)

09:29.167 --> 09:31.167
Luke, I'm so sorry.

09:31.209 --> 09:32.605
I had no idea

09:32.606 --> 09:34.000
you'd get so scared

09:31.209 --> 09:34.000
you'd puke.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.042
When did you have corn?

09:40.083 --> 09:42.042
(LAUGHING)

09:42.083 --> 09:44.042
I feel horrible.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.059
- Is there anything - I can do to make it
- Up to you?

09:46.083 --> 09:47.126
Don't you think you've

09:47.127 --> 09:48.167
ruined Halloween enough

09:46.083 --> 09:48.167
for all of us?

09:50.083 --> 09:51.167
Just go away!

09:55.083 --> 09:56.126
Hey, where is

09:56.127 --> 09:57.167
Brooks going?

09:57.209 --> 09:58.626
- What did you guys
- do to him?

09:58.667 --> 09:59.814
We didn't do

09:59.815 --> 10:00.959
anything!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.626
- He made me hurl
- on the undead!

10:02.667 --> 10:04.125
- He smashed
- Andrew Garfield!

10:04.167 --> 10:06.042
He killed Farfel!

10:06.083 --> 10:08.042
- And you're supposed
- to wind up with Tony!

10:08.083 --> 10:10.125
- Well, Tony didn't propose,
- Brooks did!

10:10.167 --> 10:11.334
(ALL GASPING)

10:11.375 --> 10:12.667
He did?

10:12.709 --> 10:14.042
- Are you going
- to say yes?

10:14.083 --> 10:15.188
Maybe!

10:15.189 --> 10:16.292
I don't know!

10:16.334 --> 10:18.042
It's complicated.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.602
- I really want
- you guys to like him,

10:19.626 --> 10:20.773
But meanwhile

10:20.774 --> 10:21.918
I'm trying to figure out

10:19.626 --> 10:21.918
if I should say yes!

10:25.042 --> 10:26.146
Wow, that Haunted House

10:26.147 --> 10:27.250
is really horrifying!

10:27.292 --> 10:28.709
They had the most

10:28.710 --> 10:30.125
realistic vomit

10:27.292 --> 10:30.125
I have ever seen.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.083
Hey, Luke...

10:39.083 --> 10:40.083
What?

10:41.083 --> 10:42.772
You see those

10:42.773 --> 10:44.459
girls over there?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.272
They want to go

10:46.273 --> 10:48.042
in the Haunted House,

10:44.500 --> 10:48.042
but they're scared, too.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.083
So now you're

10:49.084 --> 10:50.084
calling me a girl?

10:50.125 --> 10:51.626
Salt in the wound, bro.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.709
No! What I'm saying is,

10:54.751 --> 10:56.459
that since there are no

10:56.460 --> 10:58.167
scary surprises left

10:54.751 --> 10:58.167
for you in there,

10:58.209 --> 10:59.605

- Oh.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.083
Very handsome.

11:12.459 --> 11:14.042
- Hi, Brooks.
- (GASPING)

11:14.083 --> 11:16.000
- Please don't - pummel me
- With that pumpkin!

11:16.626 --> 11:18.083
I'm not, silly.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.751
- You helped me
- win the tiara,

11:19.792 --> 11:21.542
- And be crowned
- Pumpkin Princess.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.250
I did? How?

11:23.292 --> 11:24.730
Well, I used your

11:24.731 --> 11:26.167
face for inspiration...

11:30.083 --> 11:32.125
Sorry about the fangs.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.487
- I didn't like you - very much until
- You won me jewelry.

11:35.459 --> 11:37.063
Wow! This is

11:37.064 --> 11:38.667
really good.

Although, you got

11:39.877 --> 11:41.042
my haircut wrong.

No, you got

11:42.231 --> 11:43.375

- listening to me?

11:58.292 --> 11:59.334
No. I stopped listening

11:59.335 --> 12:00.375

- "Hi, I'm Jessie,
- the new nanny."

I'm not sure if Brooks

12:08.106 --> 12:09.125
is the perfect guy!

12:11.502 --> 12:13.834

perfect guys out there.

12:13.876 --> 12:14.960

would not collect

12:13.876 --> 12:16.042

12:18.083 --> 12:19.313
But he would get along

12:19.314 --> 12:20.542
with the kids better.

12:20.584 --> 12:21.834
Plus, he'd have

16:08.752 --> 16:10.167
think about what you

16:07.334 --> 16:10.167
just said.

(GRUNTING)

16:20.792 --> 16:22.626
It's a monster!

16:22.667 --> 16:23.834
And it's destroying

16:23.835 --> 16:25.000
my village!

16:25.042 --> 16:26.397
See, this is why

16:26.398 --> 16:27.751
we can't have

16:25.042 --> 16:27.751
nice things!

16:28.709 --> 16:30.063
Quick! Someone get

16:30.064 --> 16:31.417
the authorities!

16:31.459 --> 16:33.250
- You are
- the authorities!

16:33.292 --> 16:34.980
Oh, um, well,

16:34.981 --> 16:36.667
I would stop him but

16:36.709 --> 16:38.126
I feel like I have

16:38.127 --> 16:39.542
a touch of the plague

16:36.709 --> 16:39.542
coming on.

16:39.584 --> 16:40.792

super-strength!

Hey, every girl wants

her monster to look like

he hits the gym,

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

16:54.709 --> 16:55.834
Uh, perhaps we could

16:55.835 --> 16:56.959
shelve the girl talk

16:57.000 --> 16:58.959
- for when we are not
- in mortal peril!

Hi, Mr. Monster.

Great hair.

17:20.876 --> 17:23.375
Yeah, he's smokin' hot!

17:29.626 --> 17:31.501
I don't understand,

17:31.502 --> 17:33.375
he was supposed to

17:29.626 --> 17:33.375
be the perfect guy!

17:33.417 --> 17:34.980
There is no

17:34.981 --> 17:36.542
such thing as

17:33.417 --> 17:36.542
the perfect guy!

17:36.584 --> 17:38.334
- Wake up and smell
- the strudel!

17:40.584 --> 17:41.876
- Strudel!
- Huh?

17:41.918 --> 17:43.500
- Strudel?
- Where? Where?

17:44.751 --> 17:46.042
I have to go.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.042
- I just realized what my
- answer to Brooks is!

17:48.083 --> 17:49.563
What? Jessie, wait.

17:49.564 --> 17:51.042
I need to know!

17:51.083 --> 17:52.563
Bertram, it's so sweet

17:52.564 --> 17:54.042
that you care,

17:54.083 --> 17:56.059
- but I can't tell you
- until after I've told Brooks.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.459
- I don't care
- if you marry him.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.000
- Just tell me where
- the strudel is!

18:03.626 --> 18:05.000
- Hey, Ravi,
- guess what?

18:06.083 --> 18:07.480
Why are your

18:07.481 --> 18:08.876
clothes smoking?

18:08.918 --> 18:10.814
My attempts to

18:10.815 --> 18:12.709
re-animate Farfel

18:08.918 --> 18:12.709
did not go as planned.

18:12.751 --> 18:13.876
However, I did discover

18:13.877 --> 18:15.000
lightning bolts

18:15.042 --> 18:17.000
- are a wonderful cure
- for constipation.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.063
Okay. Can I see

18:20.064 --> 18:22.042
Farfel for a minute?

18:22.083 --> 18:23.563
Very well.

18:23.564 --> 18:25.042
You may pay

18:22.083 --> 18:25.042
your respects,

18:25.083 --> 18:26.751
but make it quick.

18:26.792 --> 18:27.856

Hey there, little buddy.

- He is alive!

18:41.083 --> 18:42.542
He is alive!

18:42.543 --> 18:44.000
How did you do it?

18:44.042 --> 18:45.542
I called my

18:45.543 --> 18:47.042
top veterinarian at

18:44.042 --> 18:47.042
the animal sanctuary.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.313
She told me when

18:48.314 --> 18:49.542
hamsters get too cold,

18:47.083 --> 18:49.542
they hibernate.

18:49.584 --> 18:50.814
Oh, Farfel must have

18:50.815 --> 18:52.042
gotten too chilly

18:52.083 --> 18:53.792
- when I took him
- to the terrace!

18:53.834 --> 18:54.897
Undone by

18:54.898 --> 18:55.959
my own ignorance!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.188
Huh, this must be

18:57.189 --> 18:58.375
what it feels like

18:56.000 --> 18:58.375
to be Luke!

Oh.

Proceed.

19:16.417 --> 19:17.626
Thank you.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.042
- I have something
- to say to Brooks,

19:21.083 --> 19:23.042
- And I want you
- all to hear.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.834
Wait...

19:24.876 --> 19:26.716
- Does this mean - you have an answer
- For me?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.584
Brooks...

19:29.626 --> 19:31.584
- All my life
- I've had this image

19:31.626 --> 19:32.668
In my mind

19:32.669 --> 19:33.709
of the perfect guy,

19:33.751 --> 19:35.126
and I've been

19:35.127 --> 19:36.500
looking for him in

19:33.751 --> 19:36.500
all the wrong places.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.793
Chickaterias,

19:37.794 --> 19:39.042
Frankenstein's lab,

19:39.083 --> 19:40.897
in one instance

19:40.898 --> 19:42.709
a really shady silver mine

19:39.083 --> 19:42.709
in western Nevada.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.584
That's not important.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.542
What's important is

19:49.543 --> 19:51.000
that I finally found you

19:52.083 --> 19:54.792
and I've realized...

19:54.834 --> 19:56.375
- You're not
- the perfect guy.

19:57.751 --> 19:59.000
I'm not?

20:00.083 --> 20:01.959
No.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.522
Because there is

20:03.523 --> 20:05.042
no such thing as

20:02.000 --> 20:05.042
the perfect guy.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.063
What you are

20:07.064 --> 20:09.042
is the perfect guy

20:05.083 --> 20:09.042
for me.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.563
I know, you may have

20:10.564 --> 20:12.042
made a mess of trying to win

20:09.083 --> 20:12.042
over the kids today,

20:12.083 --> 20:14.042
- but I love
- how hard you tried.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.918
Actually,

20:15.959 --> 20:17.001
Brooks didn't make

20:17.002 --> 20:18.042
a total mess of things.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.042
- Thanks to him,
- I've been grabbed by

20:20.083 --> 20:22.000
- So many girls
- in that Haunted House,

20:22.042 --> 20:23.476
- The only thing
- I'm scared of now is

20:23.500 --> 20:24.918
- If their boyfriends
- find out!

20:25.876 --> 20:27.459
- And how can I
- dislike the man

20:27.500 --> 20:29.043
Who was so gracious

20:29.044 --> 20:30.584
when I falsely accused

20:27.500 --> 20:30.584
him of hamster-cide?

20:32.083 --> 20:33.542
And he does make

20:33.543 --> 20:35.000
a fine-looking pumpkin.

20:35.042 --> 20:36.438
Plus, he loves you

20:36.439 --> 20:37.834
almost as much as we do.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.000
Aw, thank you, guys.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.959
Zuri?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.250
Well, he seems to

20:46.251 --> 20:47.500
make you happy.

20:47.542 --> 20:48.793
And he made

20:48.794 --> 20:50.042
Luke fear-vomit,

20:47.542 --> 20:50.042
so I guess I owe him.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.792
(LAUGHING)

20:53.042 --> 20:54.042
So...

20:55.083 --> 20:56.334
Are you saying

20:56.335 --> 20:57.584
what I hope

20:55.083 --> 20:57.584
you're saying?

20:58.167 --> 20:59.500
I'm saying...

21:01.751 --> 21:03.042
- Yes, I'd love
- to marry you!

21:03.083 --> 21:04.918
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:04.959 --> 21:06.000
(ALL CHEERING)

21:07.083 --> 21:08.834
I gather you said yes?

21:08.876 --> 21:09.960
Oh, I did.

21:09.961 --> 21:11.042
We're getting married!

21:11.083 --> 21:12.563
Oh! I'm so happy

21:12.564 --> 21:14.042
for you!

21:14.083 --> 21:16.042
- Ooh! And I have
- the perfect wedding gift.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.042
- I'll get my old
- boy band together

21:18.083 --> 21:20.042
- And we'll sing
- at your reception!

21:20.083 --> 21:21.125
Oh...

21:21.167 --> 21:22.667
- How do you feel
- about eloping?

21:26.834 --> 21:28.042
Oh, look.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.250
There's Zoey!

21:29.292 --> 21:30.626
Go give her Farfel back

21:30.627 --> 21:31.959
and then ask her out.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.167
- I will do it!
- As they say,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.042
- There is nothing
- women like

21:35.083 --> 21:37.164
- More than a man - with a freshly
- Groomed hamster.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.042
- I don't think
- anyone says that.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.083
Oh.

21:49.083 --> 21:51.042
Sorry, dude.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.126
Hey, we'll find some

21:52.127 --> 21:53.167
girls to take through

21:51.083 --> 21:53.167
the Haunted House.

21:53.209 --> 21:54.626
Somewhere around

21:54.627 --> 21:56.042
the ax-wielding maniac,

21:56.083 --> 21:57.418
they'll hold hands

21:57.419 --> 21:58.751
with anyone.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.751
(SCOFFS)

21:58.792 --> 21:59.959
I am both offended

21:59.960 --> 22:01.125
and titillated!

22:06.083 --> 22:07.397
So, girls,

22:07.398 --> 22:08.709
want to go play

22:06.083 --> 22:08.709
Whack-a-Skull?

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

22:10.083 --> 22:11.563
Uh-oh, it looks like

22:11.564 --> 22:13.042
there is another

22:10.083 --> 22:13.042
storm coming.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.324
- Someone should
- tell Bertram.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.834
Whee!

22:16.876 --> 22:17.959
Look at it go!

22:19.083 --> 22:20.524
- Bertram, don't!
- That's dangerous!

22:25.083 --> 22:27.667
Ba... Burgers are ready.
