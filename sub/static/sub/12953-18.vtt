00:49.015 --> 00:50.103
What's taking so long?

00:51.038 --> 00:53.300
You're an impatient bastard, aren't you?

00:53.439 --> 00:54.432
Time is money.

00:54.712 --> 00:56.420
The hydrosect will be here soon,

00:57.523 --> 01:00.093
at which point we'll move on to the next stage.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.082
Which is?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.070
Dispersal.

01:04.550 --> 01:08.410
For now we relax and enjoy ourselves.

01:09.620 --> 01:10.420
Cheers.

01:12.483 --> 01:13.332
Outrigger's armed.

01:13.518 --> 01:15.782
He's in V.I.P. with Kradic and two others.

01:16.108 --> 01:18.277
Expect delivery of hydrosect any minute.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.410
Good work, Phoenix.

01:19.595 --> 01:21.064
Once delivery is confirmed,

01:21.160 --> 01:24.205
we need to take every precaution to ensure the hydrosect remains stable.

01:24.344 --> 01:26.004
Have we confirmed the method of transport?

01:26.098 --> 01:27.807
It was Jack's responsibility.

01:29.208 --> 01:31.012
He hasn't checked in yet this morning, has he?

01:31.106 --> 01:31.528
No.

01:31.621 --> 01:35.529
Now, it'll most likely arrive in a large metal biometric case --

01:35.575 --> 01:39.192
you know, the kind that are usually named after large multinational corporations.

01:39.473 --> 01:41.038
Shotgun, what's your status?

01:41.271 --> 01:42.598
No sign of Kradic's men yet.

02:00.649 --> 02:01.260
Yeah?

02:03.987 --> 02:05.320
Good.

02:06.672 --> 02:07.713
The hydrosect's here?

02:08.133 --> 02:10.125
- Out front.
- About time.

02:22.005 --> 02:23.631
Got a visual on the hydrosect.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.028
Vaughn, take cover!

02:48.427 --> 02:49.740
Phoenix, what's happening?

03:06.102 --> 03:07.430
Drop the gun or lose your arm.

03:13.001 --> 03:14.117
Don't move!

03:28.245 --> 03:28.994
I'm on him!

03:42.415 --> 03:43.933
Phoenix, what's going on?

03:44.074 --> 03:45.686
Third party tried to intercept the hydrosect.

03:45.779 --> 03:46.676
I'm in pursuit.

04:03.057 --> 04:04.316
Put the guns down!

04:05.010 --> 04:06.958
Or this goes into the drinking water!

04:07.614 --> 04:09.082
I said put them down!

04:29.892 --> 04:32.794
Send in the biohazard team. We need to contain the hydrosect.

04:32.934 --> 04:33.831
On their way.

04:37.385 --> 04:39.742
So the CIA has the hydrosect?

04:39.881 --> 04:43.358
They got lucky. If I can find out where they took it, I can get it back.

04:43.503 --> 04:45.636
Leave that to me. Come to Los Angeles.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.058
Contact me when you get here.

04:53.014 --> 04:53.910
Everything all right?

04:54.519 --> 04:55.463
Oh, yes.

04:55.648 --> 04:57.742
Just making a hotel reservation.

04:58.112 --> 04:59.392
Sophia, you just got here.

05:14.696 --> 05:17.121
Didn't I used to say that to you?

05:17.307 --> 05:20.162
Stay. I insist. We want you to be here.

05:20.909 --> 05:21.616
Please.

05:22.223 --> 05:22.881
All right.

05:24.007 --> 05:27.097
But you must tell me the minute I become a burden.

05:27.516 --> 05:28.317
I promise.

05:39.008 --> 05:40.718
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:40.856 --> 05:42.183
Have you seen my father?

05:42.789 --> 05:43.782
Nothing yet, huh?

05:43.904 --> 05:47.475
I'm worried. I left him like a dozen messages.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.847
He was supposed to report in two days ago.

05:50.021 --> 05:51.494
So what do you want to do about it?

06:01.633 --> 06:02.817
So this is where your dad lives, huh?

06:02.956 --> 06:04.092
Yeah, what did you expect?

06:04.277 --> 06:05.604
I don't know, a bunker or something.

06:07.474 --> 06:08.418
So you've really never been here?

06:09.213 --> 06:10.683
- No.
- That's very strange.

06:10.849 --> 06:13.956
As opposed to everything else about my relationship with my father.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.124
301. Here it is.

06:28.984 --> 06:29.789
Dad?

06:33.714 --> 06:35.469
- Not much for clutter,is he?
- No.

06:52.772 --> 06:54.338
Sydney, come here. Look at this.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.788
Body temperature, blood pressure, blood cell counts.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.350
He's monitoring his vitals.

07:43.537 --> 07:44.148
Marshall.

07:44.203 --> 07:45.378
Oh, hey, did you hear the news?

07:45.475 --> 07:48.091
I get to run an initial analysis on hydrosect this afternoon.

07:48.179 --> 07:50.078
I love level 4 biohazard toxins.

07:50.172 --> 07:51.929
My father asked me to give you

07:52.023 --> 07:54.524
this artist's sketch based on descriptions from Sydney and Vaughn.

07:54.618 --> 07:56.755
- He wants to know if you can --
- Run a biometric match.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.462
Yeah, but off a sketch it's a bit tricky.

07:58.554 --> 08:00.024
Can you do it?

08:00.117 --> 08:02.016
Flinkman doesn't know the meaning of failure.

08:02.486 --> 08:05.145
One ugly puss, huh? Muy feo.

08:05.426 --> 08:08.184
Now they have a picture of you.

08:08.325 --> 08:10.082
They have a cartoon drawing.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.434
They'll never get a positive I.D. off of that.

08:12.524 --> 08:15.568
You underestimated them in Vienna,

08:15.993 --> 08:17.696
and we lost the hydrosect.

08:17.838 --> 08:18.923
Lucky break.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.205
Nadia  has a laptop with A.P.O. access.

08:22.297 --> 08:24.054
She brings it home every night.

08:24.196 --> 08:27.670
We may be able to use it to find the hydrosect.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.569
How long would it take you to hack into it?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.333
I'm afraid our options are limited, Jack.

08:37.611 --> 08:41.037
The white blood cells anomalies are not what we'd hoped for.

08:41.269 --> 08:42.835
Limited, not exhausted.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.626
Science is full of happy accidents.

08:46.964 --> 08:49.490
Alexander Fleming spent years trying to figure out

08:49.624 --> 08:51.475
how to treat bacterial infection.

08:51.570 --> 08:52.848
He  needed a vacation so bad,

08:52.949 --> 08:55.844
he forgot to wash his petri dishes before leaving the lab.

08:56.263 --> 09:00.933
So he comes back a week later, well rested, tanned, and what's he faced with?

09:01.025 --> 09:02.592
A stack of moldy dishes.

09:02.778 --> 09:05.441
But he looks a little closer, and son of a gun.

09:05.535 --> 09:08.631
Not an iota of bacteria growing anywhere near the mold.

09:08.768 --> 09:09.857
Penicillin.

09:10.042 --> 09:11.368
Just a happy accident.

09:11.555 --> 09:12.892
Fascinating anecdote,

09:12.974 --> 09:14.826
although its relevance to my condition isn't exactly --

09:14.919 --> 09:18.014
I have spent most of my career researching genetic mutations.

09:18.164 --> 09:19.287
Mostly in rats.

09:19.581 --> 09:20.561
I like rats.

09:21.108 --> 09:23.053
Much smarter than they're given credit for.

09:23.516 --> 09:27.040
These little buggers were exposed to the mother lode of radiation.

09:27.695 --> 09:31.057
I was distracted one day -- problems with the wife --

09:31.804 --> 09:35.524
and I accidentally gave them a lethal dose of an alkylating agent.

09:35.938 --> 09:38.220
But lo and behold, a few of my rats survived.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.922
Milo lived to the ripe old age of 4.

09:41.018 --> 09:41.751
That's something.

09:41.845 --> 09:45.606
Yes, but 84% of my rats were dead within a week.

09:46.446 --> 09:48.930
And given what they went through, death was a blessing.

09:49.013 --> 09:51.154
We both know the prognosis for my condition.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.714
I don't see that I have a choice.

09:53.007 --> 09:55.991
This alkylating agent was discontinued decades ago.

09:56.225 --> 09:59.079
It was considered too lethal, even in controlled environments.

09:59.171 --> 10:02.553
I have contacts. I'm sure I can procure the necessary chemicals.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.878
Here's what we need.

10:10.167 --> 10:16.080
Jack, as one friend to another, these drugs are nasty.

10:16.323 --> 10:17.260
If they don't cure you --

10:17.348 --> 10:19.066
I'll turn out like one of your rats.

10:21.815 --> 10:22.903
I'll be in touch.

10:32.395 --> 10:33.721
Come up with anything on that assailant?

10:33.824 --> 10:34.425
Not yet.

10:34.670 --> 10:37.990
But I am writing an algorithm into the program to speed things up, so...

10:38.540 --> 10:40.410
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

10:41.160 --> 10:41.670
Hello?

10:41.818 --> 10:44.481
I hate to bother you at work, but I was hoping that

10:44.574 --> 10:48.862
I could make dinner for you and Sydney and your boyfriends tomorrow night.

10:49.001 --> 10:50.520
Sophia, you don't have to.

10:50.614 --> 10:53.852
It would mean so much to me after all you've done.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.594
Are we free for dinner tomorrow?

10:55.874 --> 10:58.450
Dinner? Food? Are you kidding me? Yes.

10:58.675 --> 11:00.891
It's fine with us, but I have to check with Sydney and Vaughn.

11:00.984 --> 11:01.737
Great.

11:10.106 --> 11:10.717
Jack.

11:12.494 --> 11:13.868
Were you able to get what I requested?

11:13.979 --> 11:14.955
Yeah, sure.

11:19.584 --> 11:20.241
Cute.

11:20.567 --> 11:21.894
Listen, I need you to promise me

11:21.986 --> 11:24.420
there's no way this is gonna get traced back to me.

11:24.505 --> 11:26.167
I'm familiar with your concerns.

11:33.086 --> 11:34.092
Look, Jack...

11:35.341 --> 11:37.960
I don't mean to be presumptuous, tell you how to handle your business,

11:38.003 --> 11:40.619
but the human body is not designed to handle this stuff.

11:40.759 --> 11:42.880
Whoever this poor guy is you're gonna be torturing --

11:42.977 --> 11:46.878
Curious morality coming from a guy who kills monkeys for a living.

11:47.312 --> 11:49.205
What I'm saying -- be conservative.

11:49.338 --> 11:53.147
A few ccs at a time, or you're gonna be out of fun before it begins.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.138
Thanks for the advice.

11:54.792 --> 11:59.222
So, this -- this pays off my debt to you, right?

11:59.925 --> 12:01.583
Be seeing you, Anthony.

12:16.313 --> 12:17.162
I need a favor.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.151
Sure. What can I do for you?

12:18.243 --> 12:19.953
Pull up everything you've got an alkylating agents

12:20.054 --> 12:22.137
and cross-reference it with radiation sickness.

12:22.384 --> 12:26.053
Okay. Kind of an odd combination. What exactly are you looking for?

12:26.550 --> 12:29.529
Something's going on with my dad. I have to get to the bottom of it.

12:33.782 --> 12:35.731
Coming right up. Just, uh...

12:37.697 --> 12:39.165
Marshall, what's wrong with my father?

12:39.551 --> 12:40.187
Hmm?

12:41.655 --> 12:43.412
You know, don't you?

12:47.105 --> 12:48.909
It was after your mission to Yakutsk.

12:49.003 --> 12:49.901
Yeah?

12:57.311 --> 12:59.782
God, he pulled the fuel right out of the core reactor.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.108
He told me not to tell you.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.149
He actually made me swear on Mitchell's life,

13:03.288 --> 13:05.095
but seeing that you came in here to me,

13:05.186 --> 13:06.330
I guess I didn't really violate --

13:06.466 --> 13:08.421
I thought you shut down the reactor from here.

13:08.502 --> 13:09.903
So did I, at first.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.039
But then you got trapped in the experimental chamber,

13:12.178 --> 13:14.432
and he thought it would be best if he went inside, and --

13:14.459 --> 13:17.218
Marshall, whatever information you have on his treatment, I need it now.

13:17.311 --> 13:17.924
Syd...

13:19.077 --> 13:20.256
there is no treatment.

13:20.957 --> 13:22.857
I mean, I have been all over the medical journals,

13:23.070 --> 13:26.356
harassing researchers that I know -- some that I don't know.

13:26.450 --> 13:27.633
If there was a treatment,

13:27.959 --> 13:29.573
I would have found it by now.

13:37.336 --> 13:39.044
Sydney,  what is it?

13:39.839 --> 13:41.739
We have to find my father.

14:13.154 --> 14:15.628
Jack Bristow is in need of immediate medical attention.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.284
Currently he's off the grid.

14:17.377 --> 14:19.431
We've tried all usual avenues of communication.

14:19.513 --> 14:23.132
We have contacted every hospital and private practice in Los Angeles county.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.822
No one has record of treating him.

14:25.922 --> 14:27.624
Maybe he checked in using an alias.

14:27.757 --> 14:28.833
Well, we considered that,

14:28.908 --> 14:30.331
but the genetic mutation he experienced

14:30.423 --> 14:32.910
would require any doctor to make special note,

14:32.988 --> 14:35.987
and nothing matching your father's criteria has been reported.

14:36.547 --> 14:39.308
The truth is, whatever my father has,

14:39.773 --> 14:41.243
it isn't treatable.

14:42.066 --> 14:43.203
If he's as sick as we think he is,

14:43.295 --> 14:45.911
it's likely that his mental faculties are impaired.

14:46.004 --> 14:48.019
Which means someone might be preying on Jack

14:48.092 --> 14:49.228
using the false promise of a cure.

14:49.330 --> 14:52.319
We must act quickly. If someone is actively trying to harm Jack,

14:53.067 --> 14:55.117
he may be in no position to defend himself.

15:11.522 --> 15:12.419
How did it go?

15:13.774 --> 15:16.779
All right. I'll prepare this, and we'll be ready to go.

15:16.866 --> 15:18.816
Connie will take care of your personal belongings.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.552
How are you feeling today, Mr. Bristow?

15:20.781 --> 15:21.963
Hopeful.

15:24.862 --> 15:27.529
We got a hit. Jack just used a drive-thru ATM on 9th

15:27.619 --> 15:29.288
about 20 minutes ago down near Staples center.

15:29.356 --> 15:31.065
Great. I'll log onto the traffic surveillance network,

15:31.171 --> 15:33.107
see if I can spot his car leaving the bank.

15:33.245 --> 15:33.856
Fantastic.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.128
Come on, dad, pick up your phone.

15:37.274 --> 15:39.641
Please leave your name and number with a brief message --

15:39.749 --> 15:40.694
- Damn it.
- Syd, we'll find him.

15:41.394 --> 15:42.254
Okay, I got it!

15:48.156 --> 15:50.016
- Yeah, Marshall?
- We found his car.

15:50.109 --> 15:52.200
It's parked outside a building on Pierpont.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.431
- Do you know where Pierpont is?
- Yeah, five minutes out.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.709
Oh, thank you, Marshall. Remind me to kiss you.

15:56.802 --> 15:57.700
Okay.

15:58.877 --> 15:59.692
What? What'd she say?

15:59.765 --> 16:00.612
Uh, nothing.

16:02.248 --> 16:03.110
Everything's set.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.516
The whole procedure should take about four hours.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.928
What are these restraints for?

16:07.067 --> 16:10.304
Uh, some patients go into convulsions when they're unconscious.

16:11.051 --> 16:12.284
I didn't want you to hurt yourself.

16:12.994 --> 16:14.741
Jack, have you thought about talking to Sydney?

16:15.581 --> 16:17.436
I do keep too many secrets.

16:18.555 --> 16:20.407
When this is behind me, that's gonna change.

16:20.742 --> 16:22.204
Sydney deserves more.

16:23.185 --> 16:26.565
She deserves to know that she's the most important thing in my life.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.522
She and Laura, of course.

16:32.347 --> 16:33.817
I'm proud of you, Jack.

16:47.308 --> 16:48.278
We found his car.

17:08.523 --> 17:10.041
What would my father be doing here?

17:10.275 --> 17:11.172
I don't know.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.348
That's my father's jacket.

17:26.284 --> 17:27.711
Where is the man you took these from?

17:30.595 --> 17:32.447
Hey! Where is he?

17:40.599 --> 17:41.336
Come on.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.997
If for some reason this doesn't work,

17:45.538 --> 17:47.013
tell my girls I love them --

17:47.474 --> 17:48.911
Sydney and Laura.

17:49.177 --> 17:50.743
You're gonna pull through this, Jack.

17:54.998 --> 17:55.955
I'll see you on the other side.

18:00.103 --> 18:02.290
I'd like you to count backwards from 10.

18:03.880 --> 18:04.517
10...

18:05.753 --> 18:06.174
9...

18:07.999 --> 18:08.609
8...

18:10.762 --> 18:11.434
7...

18:15.953 --> 18:16.330
Dad.

18:16.985 --> 18:18.424
It's okay. Everything's...

18:18.686 --> 18:19.787
Oh, my god, dad.

18:21.456 --> 18:23.116
Marshall, we need medical attention now.

18:35.228 --> 18:37.850
Sydney's with Jack. They've taken him to the infirmary.

18:38.905 --> 18:40.896
So he injected himself with poison?

18:41.472 --> 18:43.049
Well, apparently he thought it was a cure.

18:43.238 --> 18:45.807
Now they got it out of his system, but this illness --

18:45.947 --> 18:47.234
they say within 72 hours,

18:47.384 --> 18:49.601
his condition will advance to the point where it's irreversible.

18:49.832 --> 18:51.302
Did he wake up in the ambulance?

18:51.441 --> 18:54.110
Briefly. He kept wanting to see his doctor -- Dr. Liddell.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.614
Apparently he's been suffering from hallucinations for weeks.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.197
- Dr. Liddell?
- Yeah.

19:00.803 --> 19:02.762
Dr. Atticus Liddell.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.126
He exists?

19:05.737 --> 19:06.734
He did.

19:07.805 --> 19:11.568
25 years ago, Atticus Liddell developed a radical thesis

19:11.660 --> 19:14.096
regarding the treatment of genetic mutations.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.907
In 1981, he left the U.S. to pursue his theories.

19:17.681 --> 19:19.581
He was working with patients devastated

19:19.674 --> 19:22.673
by an undisclosed nuclear accident in the soviet union.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.269
Unfortunately, it was the cold war.

19:25.752 --> 19:28.138
Shortly after he arrived,

19:28.223 --> 19:32.161
the soviets became convinced that in addition to being a physician,

19:32.254 --> 19:34.059
Liddell was also a spy.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.754
Which he was.

19:35.893 --> 19:37.042
- Did they kill him?
- No.

19:37.123 --> 19:39.746
One of Jack's handlers informed us of the russians' suspicions,

19:39.901 --> 19:42.256
and Jack was able to extract him before they could act.

19:42.396 --> 19:45.831
He  changed his name, gave him a new identity.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.389
Then there must be a record of where Liddell was relocated.

19:48.483 --> 19:51.577
No. In those times, Jack and his handler had a strict policy --

19:51.724 --> 19:54.763
anything that sensitive, they kept no documentation.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.768
So we have to contact my dad's handler.

19:56.894 --> 19:59.005
Jack's handler is dead.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.436
He died eight years ago.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.130
But supposing Jack knows where Liddell is,

20:05.469 --> 20:08.371
why didn't he make contact when he first developed symptoms?

20:08.464 --> 20:09.609
He thought he did.

20:09.907 --> 20:14.530
Wow. Mr. Bristow hallucinated the one man who can actually save his life.

20:14.763 --> 20:16.235
Even his delusions are lucid.

20:16.326 --> 20:18.485
A man like Liddell can't just disappear.

20:18.562 --> 20:19.743
Yes, he could,

20:20.210 --> 20:22.208
if he was hidden by my father.

20:30.388 --> 20:31.238
Hey.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.527
Is there anything I can do?

20:37.666 --> 20:40.473
We're doing everything to find a doctor who might be able to help.

20:41.735 --> 20:44.257
- I'm so sorry, Syd.
- Thank you.

20:47.061 --> 20:49.256
I'm gonna sit with him for a while.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.669
You want company? I'll cancel dinner with Sophia.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.604
You should keep it. There's nothing you can do here anyway.

20:54.691 --> 20:57.223
Okay. But if you need anything...

21:06.684 --> 21:08.337
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:09.908 --> 21:11.431
Mmm. Something smells good.

21:11.844 --> 21:13.509
- You must be Eric.
- Yes.

21:13.599 --> 21:17.362
- I'm Sophia.
- Oh, hi. Eric Weiss. Oh, wow.

21:17.455 --> 21:19.307
How are you? I love her already.

21:19.477 --> 21:22.809
I'm so sorry Sydney couldn't make it. How sick is her father?

21:22.934 --> 21:25.042
It's hard to say. They're running some tests now.

21:25.136 --> 21:26.796
- Yeah.
- That's awful.

21:27.075 --> 21:31.029
It's very hard. When it's a parent, it's always so difficult.

21:31.180 --> 21:34.765
Give me those. I want you two to relax. You had a rough day.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.638
I'll take care of everything.

21:37.344 --> 21:39.143
- Uh, Eric?
- Yeah?

21:39.236 --> 21:42.283
You have no ideahow excited I am to meet you.

21:42.729 --> 21:45.753
Nadia says the most beautiful things about you.

21:48.151 --> 21:49.031
Really?

21:49.356 --> 21:52.171
She asked me if you were tall, dark, and handsome.

21:52.349 --> 21:54.019
I told her you were tall.

22:38.461 --> 22:39.055
Dad?

22:40.737 --> 22:41.873
Dad, can you hear me?

22:42.434 --> 22:43.091
Oh...

22:44.184 --> 22:45.016
Oh...

22:46.116 --> 22:46.892
Hello.

22:47.358 --> 22:48.064
Hi.

22:49.934 --> 22:52.788
What are you doing -- why am --

22:52.906 --> 22:54.792
I need to ask you something, dad.

22:54.921 --> 22:55.960
Oh, no.

22:56.101 --> 23:02.013
It was my turn to pick up Sydney after dance class. I'm sorry.

23:04.209 --> 23:06.587
Can -- can you take care of that?

23:06.708 --> 23:09.327
I'll cover next time, Laura, I promise.

23:09.810 --> 23:10.564
Laura?

23:13.370 --> 23:17.451
I don't -- I don't know why I'm so tired, sweetheart.

23:18.567 --> 23:19.754
I'm so tired.

23:33.057 --> 23:36.081
What are these, the emperanas? These are inc-- they're so good.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.595
Empanadas.

23:37.710 --> 23:38.942
Whatever. They're delicious.

23:39.066 --> 23:42.368
I taught Nadia how to make them when she was very little.

23:42.695 --> 23:44.072
Well, I've been seriously deprived.

23:44.163 --> 23:45.554
Please.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.033
Have you ever made these for me?

23:49.922 --> 23:51.157
Excuse me.

23:51.392 --> 23:52.367
Can't you let it go?

23:52.456 --> 23:54.356
I really have to get this. I'm sorry.

23:56.489 --> 23:57.228
Nadia.

23:58.476 --> 23:59.876
Do you want some more wine?

23:59.990 --> 24:02.320
- Sure.
- Red? White?
- Red.

24:12.139 --> 24:14.380
I know there's -- you know, there's seafood in here, but what --

24:14.560 --> 24:16.667
what is this? Is this artichoke hearts?

24:16.816 --> 24:17.990
- What is this?
- Many things.

24:18.254 --> 24:21.922
And the rice. What is the spice in the rice? I can't -- is it, um...

24:22.014 --> 24:24.642
- Saffron.
- Ah. Saffron.

24:24.957 --> 24:28.481
I was going for cumin. Saffron -- your secret ingredient. Of course.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.426
- It was Vaughn.
- How's Jack?

24:37.843 --> 24:39.440
He's too far gone, Sydney.

24:40.669 --> 24:44.315
In his present mental state, he will never tells where he hid Liddell.

24:44.829 --> 24:48.956
Not to mention that it's possible your father doesn't even remember.

24:49.032 --> 24:50.557
My father doesn't forget things.

24:50.728 --> 24:51.978
We can hypnotize him.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.741
Yeah, I considered that myself, but given his situation,

24:54.831 --> 24:57.018
his condition, these hallucinations...

25:00.385 --> 25:04.102
He called me Laura. He thought I was my mother.

25:04.193 --> 25:08.248
He called you Laura? Not Irina? You said he called you Laura.

25:11.064 --> 25:14.381
Suppose we convince your father that he's still living in 1981,

25:14.613 --> 25:17.421
specifically the day that he extracted Liddell out of Russia.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.407
My dad's hallucinating.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.535
That's distinctly different from what you're suggesting.

25:22.617 --> 25:27.901
No, no, I'm not sure it is. Calling you Laura, imagining Dr. Liddell.

25:30.871 --> 25:33.738
What if we could recreate his surroundings?

25:33.982 --> 25:36.666
Perhaps we could guide his delusions, get him to reveal

25:37.114 --> 25:39.204
exactly where he relocated Liddell.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.485
You want me to be my mother?

25:45.308 --> 25:46.160
That's right.

25:57.709 --> 25:58.540
Found a girl.

26:00.222 --> 26:01.836
Six years old. She's got your eyes.

26:02.444 --> 26:05.540
Her mom wants to know if she can use this for her acting reel.

26:07.455 --> 26:08.161
You okay?

26:11.199 --> 26:12.717
I get it. Not okay.

26:15.689 --> 26:17.248
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

26:19.426 --> 26:20.514
Well, you know, it's not too late.

26:20.606 --> 26:22.077
We can always have Weiss dress up as Irina.

26:22.170 --> 26:23.737
I'm sure he'd make a great housewife.

26:25.980 --> 26:30.623
I don't remember my parents back when they were together.

26:30.873 --> 26:32.052
Well, you were a little girl.

26:32.891 --> 26:34.903
I remember the time. I don't remember them.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.507
My dad... was my dad.

26:40.596 --> 26:43.955
He was never around when I was a kid. He was always away on business.

26:44.637 --> 26:45.929
My mom...

26:47.124 --> 26:49.694
I don't know what my dad was like around my mother,

26:49.832 --> 26:53.311
or what she was like around him. I don't know how to do this.

26:53.402 --> 26:54.660
Syd, it's just a job.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.999
It's another alias like all of the others.

26:57.279 --> 26:59.895
Just trust your training. Follow your dad's cues.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.315
Follow his lead.

27:02.318 --> 27:05.295
Besides, I've got snipers everywhere if he starts to get inappropriate.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.362
They're ready.

27:15.512 --> 27:16.916
Hey, listen to me.

27:19.261 --> 27:20.248
You can do this.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.935
Oh, my god.

27:46.410 --> 27:47.446
It's unsettling, isn't it?

27:47.787 --> 27:49.113
This is my old house.

27:50.889 --> 27:54.754
It should be sufficient as long as Jack doesn't examine the details too closely, hmm?

27:57.101 --> 27:58.689
That bowl is in the wrong place.

28:01.698 --> 28:03.433
Hmm. It's murano glass.

28:04.202 --> 28:06.156
Emily and I gave this to your parents --

28:07.358 --> 28:09.002
or at least the original version --

28:09.812 --> 28:11.111
as a housewarming gift.

28:11.196 --> 28:12.444
It belongs on the coffee table.

28:13.365 --> 28:14.807
That's right.

28:16.471 --> 28:20.330
We'll give you a few minutes after Jack wakes up to sell the illusion.

28:20.476 --> 28:23.085
When the phone rings, give him his privacy.

28:24.958 --> 28:28.049
Medical will move in as soon as we get Liddell's location.

28:29.965 --> 28:31.136
We'll get this --

28:34.281 --> 28:36.467
we'll get this over with as quickly as possible, Sydney.

28:43.598 --> 28:44.262
You ready?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.949
Your mother used to call your father "sweetheart."

28:51.235 --> 28:52.220
It was a pet name for him.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.045
Good luck.

29:14.049 --> 29:15.234
He should be conscious in 30 seconds.

29:32.955 --> 29:33.932
Turn on the television.

29:34.226 --> 29:37.654
Okay. TV... on.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.505
Sydney, go ahead.

30:24.105 --> 30:24.894
Jack?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.024
Oh, good. You're home.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.810
Sydney?

30:50.974 --> 30:52.062
She's upstairs, isn't she?

30:56.036 --> 30:57.076
Would you give me a hand with these?

31:04.557 --> 31:05.758
Sweetheart, is something wrong?

31:10.338 --> 31:12.544
- It's not working.
- Just give her a moment, please.

31:12.894 --> 31:16.216
Arvin called. He and Emily want to have dinner next Saturday.

31:16.401 --> 31:17.399
I told him we'd love to.

31:25.111 --> 31:26.474
You could have just said we're busy.

31:28.823 --> 31:31.155
I know you put up with Arvin for my sake.

31:31.388 --> 31:35.056
Sweetheart, he's your best friend. I'm your wife. I can tolerate him.

31:40.964 --> 31:41.978
How can you do that?

31:42.963 --> 31:44.004
Do what?

31:44.237 --> 31:45.755
How can you be so perfect?

31:46.922 --> 31:47.964
Loving mother...

31:49.132 --> 31:51.366
beautiful wife, just --

31:52.421 --> 31:54.085
just by standing there.

32:00.109 --> 32:00.880
Vaughn.

32:04.751 --> 32:05.600
Would you get that?

32:15.497 --> 32:16.146
Hello.

32:16.265 --> 32:18.790
Control number 80709. Is this line secure?

32:19.384 --> 32:20.114
Yes, it is.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.599
I'm calling from agent Grady's office.

32:21.784 --> 32:23.924
We've moved up the timetable to get Liddell out of Minsk.

32:24.004 --> 32:25.210
We have to get him out of there now.

32:25.587 --> 32:26.629
Yes, I understand.

32:26.815 --> 32:28.211
I can expedite your movements from here.

32:28.286 --> 32:29.800
What travel arrangements do you need set up?

32:34.573 --> 32:35.979
Jack, where do you want Liddell moved?

32:45.296 --> 32:46.528
His mind's rejecting this,

32:46.864 --> 32:49.326
possibly because Vaughn's voice doesn't sound like his handler's.

32:49.841 --> 32:51.251
We should send in the girl.

32:52.049 --> 32:52.950
Do it, Marshall.

32:53.139 --> 32:56.285
Sending in...the girl.

33:00.582 --> 33:01.489
Hi, dad.

33:02.577 --> 33:04.537
Is it okay if I practice the piano?

33:06.526 --> 33:07.317
Of course.

33:12.111 --> 33:13.919
- Are you still there?
- Yes, of course.

33:14.382 --> 33:16.664
- I have company.
- I understand.

33:16.821 --> 33:19.293
About the doctor, I've been feeling a bit under the weather,

33:19.385 --> 33:20.917
but I'm much better now.

33:21.423 --> 33:23.043
It's code. Do you recognize it?

33:23.131 --> 33:25.481
No, must be something Jack had with his handler.

33:27.138 --> 33:27.676
Go ahead.

33:27.994 --> 33:30.217
Despite that, I think I'd be wise to have a checkup.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.218
It's been a year since my last stress test.

33:32.872 --> 33:34.294
Can you schedule that for me?

33:34.621 --> 33:35.647
You got it.

33:36.185 --> 33:36.980
Thank you.

33:39.079 --> 33:41.128
Sydney, Marshall should be able to decode the message.

33:41.683 --> 33:43.140
Keep trying to get Liddell's location.

33:54.247 --> 33:55.564
Sorry, honey.I have bad news.

33:55.776 --> 33:56.339
Oh?

33:57.040 --> 33:59.704
That was Grady. Who else would it be this early on a Sunday?

33:59.855 --> 34:02.559
He has a mission for me. I'm afraid I have to leave town.

34:02.648 --> 34:04.921
He told her. She knew he was a spy.

34:05.349 --> 34:06.462
It would seem so.

34:08.027 --> 34:08.685
What's the mission?

34:10.672 --> 34:13.364
There's a doctor whose research has put his life in danger.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.215
I need to make him disappear.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.507
New name, new identity, new life.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.451
Low risk. I promise.

34:23.112 --> 34:24.775
- Where will you take him?
- Finland.

34:25.117 --> 34:27.777
Marshall, run a biometric of Dr. Liddell

34:27.902 --> 34:31.311
against the databases of finnish passport offices and medical licensing board.

34:31.405 --> 34:32.373
Already on it.

34:32.525 --> 34:33.877
Sydney, we got it. Good work.

34:34.350 --> 34:37.109
What concerns me -- I won't be back until next week.

34:38.978 --> 34:40.496
I'll miss Sydney's birthday again.

34:42.870 --> 34:43.799
That's okay.

34:44.853 --> 34:47.231
You'll explain it to her. She'll understand.

34:47.402 --> 34:50.295
She's a child. She shouldn't need to understand her father

34:50.839 --> 34:52.884
isn't home to celebrate her birthday.

34:55.681 --> 34:58.639
Laura, the only memories I have of my father are of him leaving.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.322
I don't want it to be that way for her.

35:10.854 --> 35:11.724
She deserves better.

35:21.097 --> 35:22.509
The work you do is important.

35:25.463 --> 35:26.652
Not as important as her.

35:28.610 --> 35:29.365
Or you.

35:35.436 --> 35:41.301
When I get back from Europe, I'm going to talk to my supervisors.

35:43.338 --> 35:44.093
What about?

35:45.025 --> 35:46.061
I'm giving notice.

35:49.237 --> 35:49.983
Sorry.

35:51.353 --> 35:53.747
I should have discussed this with you before I made any decisions.

35:54.018 --> 35:54.526
No.

35:58.812 --> 36:00.620
That means more to me than you'll ever know.

36:16.298 --> 36:18.027
We'll send in the med techs to sedate your father.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.054
That's good. Can I join you?

36:35.240 --> 36:36.047
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

37:01.014 --> 37:01.470
Laur-- ahh!

37:26.598 --> 37:27.485
Dr. Liddell.

37:31.769 --> 37:33.490
Jack Bristow needs your help.

37:42.823 --> 37:45.180
Guys! Weiss, Nadia, hold on.

37:45.477 --> 37:48.857
I was about to run some more carbide tests on the hydrosect --

37:49.229 --> 37:51.608
case carbide tests, and I went to get it out of cold storage,

37:51.764 --> 37:53.463
and it wasn't there, but of course you knew that.

37:53.548 --> 37:54.356
How would we know that?

37:54.517 --> 37:55.933
Well, it was moved at your request

37:56.202 --> 37:58.665
by your unit to a low-security facility off-site.

37:58.842 --> 38:01.998
I'm just wondering why, 'cause that's some dangerous stuff.

38:11.302 --> 38:12.081
Excuse me, sir.

38:12.364 --> 38:13.473
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm lost.

38:13.643 --> 38:17.323
Could you please tell me where Division street is, please?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.639
Sure. Actually Division street is the one-way street heading north.

38:20.945 --> 38:21.908
What's going on?

38:22.892 --> 38:24.376
Just some lady asking directions.

38:24.890 --> 38:26.683
No one in our unit authorized anything.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.443
Well, the request was authenticated. It came over our secure network.

38:36.184 --> 38:38.972
The security system's offline. I'm calling it in.

38:39.436 --> 38:42.561
You're saying that way is a one-way street, goes --

38:42.643 --> 38:43.742
Right -- aah!

38:46.892 --> 38:48.355
Hey, hey, hey, how did you get in --

39:01.002 --> 39:02.522
Nothing. I'm getting nothing. No answer.

39:02.619 --> 39:02.996
Let's go.

39:19.007 --> 39:20.094
It's double-folded titanium.

39:22.057 --> 39:23.216
Take a look at this.

39:24.220 --> 39:25.513
You can cut through that.

39:44.017 --> 39:44.632
Done.

40:23.446 --> 40:24.912
The hydrosect's gone.

40:26.365 --> 40:27.176
Oh, god.

40:29.409 --> 40:30.544
It's the guy from Vienna.

40:31.297 --> 40:32.721
The one Sydney and Vaughn --

40:33.183 --> 40:34.283
What the hell happened here?

40:50.123 --> 40:52.512
Atticus. So good of you to come.

40:53.089 --> 40:54.416
After what Jack did for me...

40:56.377 --> 40:58.686
Sydney will show you the infirmary. If there's anything you need --

40:58.787 --> 41:00.541
- I'd like to see my patient.
- Right this way.

41:13.632 --> 41:14.326
Dad?

41:17.890 --> 41:18.596
Dad?

41:20.819 --> 41:22.010
A friend is here to see you.

41:24.782 --> 41:25.561
Hello, Jack.

41:30.383 --> 41:31.479
Am I cured?

41:33.162 --> 41:34.073
Not yet.

41:35.190 --> 41:36.467
But I'm going to make you better.
