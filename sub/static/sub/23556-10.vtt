00:03.471 --> 00:05.471
Operation Reverse Heist
is gonna be hard.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.971
We're gonna have to avoid
guards and cameras

00:07.041 --> 00:08.273
to get the fake vase
back from Lucia's house.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.409
Thank you.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.477
Let's get started with step one:

00:11.545 --> 00:13.045
climb into the dumpster.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.546
All right, guys, get in.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.881
- Eww!
- Shh!

00:15.950 --> 00:17.983
Step two, and that's where Sal comes in

00:18.052 --> 00:22.388
with an ingenious garbage blanket.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.023
Would you believe me if I said

00:24.091 --> 00:25.524
that smell is my breath?

00:25.593 --> 00:28.227
I did have a lot
of garlic for breakfast.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.832
Tess makes a fake call
to Lucia pretending to be

00:33.901 --> 00:37.002
her lawyer's receptionist.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.203
Hello?

00:38.272 --> 00:40.139
Yeah... uh...

00:40.207 --> 00:42.141
This is...

00:42.209 --> 00:43.475
Hello?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.310
- Say something!
- Hello?

00:45.379 --> 00:49.348
This is Ellen Yankowitz
from Julius C. Ward law firm.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.785
- Is this Lucia Jansen?
- Yes.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.792
We recently found a vault
that belonged to William,

00:59.860 --> 01:02.528
and we strongly believe
that his will is inside.

01:02.596 --> 01:06.832
William's will? Oh, my.
Should I come by?

01:06.901 --> 01:09.334
Certainly! You can meet us

01:09.403 --> 01:12.771
at the big church in Amsterdam Square.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.706
I would bet there's some
important information

01:14.775 --> 01:16.141
regarding his fortune,

01:16.210 --> 01:18.143
or my name isn't Helen Yankowitz.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.813
I thought you said your name was Ellen.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.082
It... it is...

01:23.150 --> 01:25.784
Um, all of us Ellens
know that the name Helen

01:25.853 --> 01:27.686
is pretty much
interchangeable with Ellen.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.923
It's a Helen and Ellen thing.
You wouldn't get it.

01:30.991 --> 01:34.993
Okay, right. Well, um, I'm on my way.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.929
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.923
Operation Reverse Heist is a go!

02:04.992 --> 02:06.425
Good luck!

02:07.595 --> 02:09.328
All right... there.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.100
And... go.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.137
Ow, my toe!

02:21.609 --> 02:24.009
Let's patrol the parameter.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.688
John.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.332
Come on. Go that way.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.535
Too sharp, too sharp, too sharp.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.251
- We're almost there.
- Okay.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.293
- Stop! Two minutes, yes!
- Yes!

03:14.361 --> 03:17.663
Wait.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.768
I thought John put the bin out already.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.607
Forget it.

03:28.676 --> 03:32.077
It's not our job, anyway.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.983
This looks good.
I should bake more often.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.385
- Mmm, yummy!
- Is it good?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.187
Rinus!

03:42.256 --> 03:43.522
Do you want to try
some candy with apples

03:43.591 --> 03:45.224
and even more candy cake we just baked?

03:45.292 --> 03:48.894
Well, that sounds wonderful,
but I just had a big lunch.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.929
Oh, this is Evie, my new sister.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.332
Well, my new younger sister.
Does it show?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
Do I look more mature
standing next to her?

03:55.302 --> 03:56.735
'Cause I think I do.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.170
This is Rinus, our old friend.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.205
Well, you're not old...
Well, you're kind of old.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.873
- But not old as in...
- Mm, mm, mm...

04:01.942 --> 04:03.542
- Okay, I'll stop now.
- Mm, mm, mm, mmm.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.578
Well, you sure have grown
since the last time.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.983
Uh...

04:11.051 --> 04:12.718
Wait, you know her?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.887
Well, I do now. We just met.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.457
Yeah, but you just said she's grown.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.726
Yeah, well, your father must've told me.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.294
Yeah, but she hasn't grown
since she moved here.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.730
Is your father home?
I really need to speak to him.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.565
Yeah, he's in the museum.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.900
- But...
- Yeah, all right. Be seeing you.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.969
Enjoy your cake, Evie.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.012
Thumbs up emoji.

05:21.288 --> 05:24.056
Shh!

05:24.124 --> 05:27.059
Message from Jake. We can proceed.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.360
I need to get out of here.

05:29.697 --> 05:33.298
This thing smells terrible.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.133
What'd you use for this
fake garbage blanket anyway?

05:35.202 --> 05:39.071
Oh, actually, I didn't have
time to make fake garbage.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.673
You used real garbage?

05:42.943 --> 05:44.776
When I get home,
I am taking a forever shower.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.412
Okay, great. But now, we gotta move.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.089
Shh!

05:59.593 --> 06:01.426
No. Here.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.931
Oh, I'm stuck.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.800
You okay?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.977
Kate said it's
not polite to eavesdrop.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.814
But, I think she means it's not
polite to eavesdrop on her.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.183
And she's not here, so...

06:25.252 --> 06:28.286
I think you don't understand
how serious your situation is.

06:28.355 --> 06:32.591
I do, more than you think.
But it doesn't change anything.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.694
Tess and Sal and Jake
are gonna want to know

06:35.763 --> 06:36.762
what they're talking about.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.830
Come on.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.101
Is that a toy?

06:43.170 --> 06:47.472
No, it's a high-tech
listening device that Sal made.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.475
Out of a toy.
But it's pretty cool, though.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.110
One day, you'll be able to use it.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.113
But for now, just follow my lead.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.282
You ready?

06:57.351 --> 07:01.787
Okay, three... two...

07:01.855 --> 07:04.222
One!

07:06.326 --> 07:07.959
- I don't like it.
- Me neither.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.861
Let me fix it.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.936
If things go south,

07:18.005 --> 07:20.105
the proceedings won't go as planned.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.406
The proceedings
have been the same

07:21.475 --> 07:22.741
for hundreds of years.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.676
There's no reason to change them now.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.078
Really? I see
thousands of reasons.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.880
Do you think it's about
the crown symbol?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.350
- Or about Eric going to jail?
- I can ask, hold on.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.552
No, wait.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.089
Yes? I tried, I really did.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.258
No, you know Eric.
He wants to do everything

07:40.327 --> 07:43.128
the old fashioned way, the official way.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.230
We have to discuss this in person.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.065
I'll meet you at
the Rembrandt Square, right?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.134
At the statues. Yes...

07:51.972 --> 07:54.673
At the statues...

07:54.741 --> 07:56.408
How good are you at standing still?

07:59.446 --> 08:00.946
Evie?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.115
Oh, you're doing it already.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.784
You're a natural.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.022
Hey, you can stop for now.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.746
Can you hack any faster?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.313
I'm trying. I almost have it.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.253
Lucia won't stay away forever.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.155
It will go a lot quicker
if you stop distracting me.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.096
Done. Cameras officially disconnected.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.698
Well done, little bro.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.910
Boom! Mission accomplished.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.979
That's the heist catchphrase, right?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.049
But the mission isn't accomplished.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.118
We still have to get ou...

09:16.223 --> 09:17.989
That's weird.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.092
CCU cameras are all malfunctioning.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.161
So be extra vigilant.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.916
Yes?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.484
What?!

09:46.553 --> 09:48.653
They're in my house? Call the guards!

09:48.722 --> 09:51.523
Lock the residence down.
I'm coming home right now!

09:51.592 --> 09:53.692
Oh, no.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.594
I have to warn the others.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.152
Hey, we've got some trouble.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.154
- Something's up.
- Yeah, no kidding.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.991
The new cameras are all down.

10:28.395 --> 10:31.830
Lucia knows we're here
and she's coming back.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.466
We gotta move.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.951
He's looking.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.286
Try not to move, okay?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.188
Try not to even nod, okay?

11:01.862 --> 11:02.961
That was close.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.796
We just have to stay still for a while.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.532
- How long?
- Until we know more.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.168
Freedom!

11:11.304 --> 11:14.205
- Come on.
- Do we have to?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.874
What di...

11:15.942 --> 11:19.110
Lucia's back. Okay...

11:19.179 --> 11:20.845
Come on.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.348
Come on.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.090
Guards!

11:32.159 --> 11:35.126
- She's back.
- Oh, this is bad.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.262
This is bad. This is...
This is real, real bad.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.596
- You think?
- High alert.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.666
We gotta lock this place down.
Check everything everywhere.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.401
Nobody gets in or out!

11:53.647 --> 11:54.979
Please don't screech...

11:55.048 --> 11:57.315
Please don't screech. Please don't...

11:57.384 --> 11:58.817
...He doesn't seem to realize

11:58.885 --> 12:00.652
that if he goes to jail,

12:00.721 --> 12:03.121
the proceedings won't go as planned.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.623
Eric is no
longer the only problem.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.459
His children are meddling
with everything.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.494
They're trying to exonerate him.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.663
They broke into Lucia's house
to plant a vase

12:11.732 --> 12:13.732
and try and frame...

12:16.803 --> 12:19.270
Stopped... now...

12:22.676 --> 12:26.311
- Puppy!
- Ignore the puppy! We're statues.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.780
Statues never get distracted
and statues never care...

12:39.626 --> 12:41.359
- Do you agree?
- I do.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.128
Please start to get serious.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.966
Goodbye, little puppy!

13:11.124 --> 13:13.091
Um, new plan. I need a new plan.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.260
A good heist always has a plan B.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.662
Right, okay. There's an idea
out there somewhere.

13:17.731 --> 13:20.331
Yeah, let's play... free associate.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.700
The first thing that pops
into your head, Jake.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.603
Okay, um, well, we have pandas,

13:25.672 --> 13:29.908
walruses, zoos, zookeepers...

13:29.976 --> 13:31.976
Guards!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.880
Okay, um, yes. Guards, guards.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.882
Wow.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.251
Guards, the toilet.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.187
This isn't helping! Come on, Jake.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.088
Something, anything.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.457
Jake!

13:50.730 --> 13:53.731
I thought I already took
that one out to the shed.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.649
Hold it right there.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.719
Did somebody call the police?

14:14.788 --> 14:16.888
I'm warning everyone
in the neighborhood.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.957
A wild animal just escaped from the zoo.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.993
- A wild animal?
- Is it dangerous?

14:22.062 --> 14:24.696
Oh, yes, extremely.
It's, uh, it's a snake!

14:24.764 --> 14:27.999
A large, venomous snake.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.801
Uh, the dumpster cobra.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.270
That's what it's called.
The dumpster cobra, yes.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.605
It's extremely dangerous.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.774
The live in the Amazon,
and in the Netherlands.

14:36.843 --> 14:40.979
They got their name because they
love to sleep in warm dumpsters.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.313
I think there might be one in here.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.048
I hate snakes!

14:44.117 --> 14:45.750
Smart man. Let me take a look.

14:45.819 --> 14:49.187
It's my snake stick
for combating cobras.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.922
Step back. They're really dangerous.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.162
Uh, yes! That's the snake all right.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.231
I can't be entirely sure 'cause it's...

15:00.300 --> 15:02.901
It's not making any hissing
noises like a snake would.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.236
Oh! It's a wild one, all right!

15:05.305 --> 15:06.437
Hit it with your snake stick!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.573
Uh, you can't hit a dumpster cobra.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.108
It... They're an endangered species.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.411
I'll, uh, I'll need to take it
back to the zoo ASAP.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.880
It's too dangerous to remove,
so I'll just be taking

15:15.949 --> 15:17.882
the entire dumpster.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.884
All right, thank you very much

15:19.953 --> 15:21.119
for all your help.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.320
I'll be taking it from here.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.721
Bye.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.161
The security cameras
are all disconnected.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.663
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.698
But there was a dumpster cobra

15:33.767 --> 15:34.866
on the loose out here.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.768
Don't worry. Luckily, a cop showed up

15:36.836 --> 15:38.169
out of nowhere and took care of it

15:38.238 --> 15:39.904
And took the entire dumpster!

15:39.973 --> 15:43.374
- A dumpster cobra?
- I know, right? Unbelievable.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.743
There's no such thing
as a dumpster cobra!

15:45.812 --> 15:47.912
- You chucklehead!
- Are you sure?

15:47.981 --> 15:51.382
I mean, there are some crazy
species out there in the wild.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.117
Get out of my sight! Now!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.825
Hello?

16:00.894 --> 16:02.660
Yes, you were right.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.365
I think the kids were here.
They got away.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.260
Martin.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.930
Something wrong?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.768
Do you find anything strange

16:43.837 --> 16:46.838
about those statues across the canal?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.709
What statues?

16:51.778 --> 16:55.880
What... I don't know.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.883
I must be imagining things.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.618
I don't know, let's go.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.620
- We got important stuff to attend to.
- Yes.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.792
Yes, as we agreed,

17:08.862 --> 17:10.361
those Hunter kids must be stopped.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.996
Yes...

17:12.065 --> 17:13.531
I thought he spotted us.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.800
We know enough. Let's go home.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.873
- Listen to me very carefully...
- Daniel, we can explain!

17:21.941 --> 17:23.574
No, what you guys did today
was really dangerous.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.877
Do you realize that?
This isn't a joke, okay?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.080
Not to me, and not to Eric.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.849
You could've made this
so much worse for him.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.485
And much, much worse for yourselves.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.554
So what're you gonna tell Eric and Kate?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.693
What's his problem?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.429
He turned into an adult.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.799
Oh, there you are.
I was getting worried.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.668
I was trying to call you,
but no responses.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.272
What's that awful
smell? Where've you been?

17:54.340 --> 17:55.640
- We went to the zoo.
- We got some ice cream.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.144
Ahem, there were animals. And ice cream.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.813
They went to the zoo,

18:01.881 --> 18:03.514
and then while they were at the zoo,

18:03.583 --> 18:05.249
they got some ice cream.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.851
I was there while overlooking

18:06.920 --> 18:08.553
the transport of a wild animal

18:08.621 --> 18:11.556
and figured I'd give 'em a lift.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.624
Well, I'm glad everybody's okay.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.992
But next time you go to the zoo

18:15.061 --> 18:16.594
or have an ice cream, let me know.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.096
I might join you.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.766
Now go have a shower.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.668
- All right, I'll see you later, Eric.
- Yeah.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.340
Enough, okay?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.344
With the silent treatment.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.645
Talk to me, what's wrong?

18:34.714 --> 18:38.649
What's wrong? Eric might go to jail.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.686
And you guys are running around
doing dangerous stuff

18:41.754 --> 18:43.621
and I'm stuck in the middle of it all.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.223
You're not stuck in the middle.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.092
I'm a cop now. I know you guys

18:48.161 --> 18:50.595
don't take that seriously, but I do.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.831
I have real obligations now.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.200
You guys want me to be a Hunter first

18:56.269 --> 18:58.569
and a cop second, but...

18:58.638 --> 19:01.172
I don't know if I can do that.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.075
You know, I have a boss and...
and real responsibilities

19:04.144 --> 19:07.145
and other people on the force
who count on me too.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.818
It's tough. I get it.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.524
What if I promise

19:19.592 --> 19:22.593
that we will try to stop
doing dangerous stuff?

19:24.097 --> 19:26.497
Trying is better than nothing, I guess.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.400
Thank you.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.968
For not telling Eric.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.938
And the whole saving us thing.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.373
You're a great cop.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.275
You think so?

19:37.343 --> 19:40.344
Not only that, you're a great Hunter.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.146
And you're a great big brother too.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.554
No offense, but you smell really awful.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.355
I know, I need a shower.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.692
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.729
- Hey, Max, what's up?
- Hey, Max!

19:58.798 --> 20:00.331
Yo, how'd it go?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.799
Two words for you, bro.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.334
Boom! Mission accomplished.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.203
- That's three words.
- How?

20:05.271 --> 20:07.872
Boom. Mission.
Accomplished. Three words.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.409
- Yo, is this line safe?
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.578
Did you find anything else
while you were there?

20:13.646 --> 20:16.247
- About the crown, maybe?
- Didn't have time.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.715
Somebody tipped Lucia off.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.850
I mean, she got a phone call
just as our plan

20:19.919 --> 20:22.253
was going into motion.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.423
That's super weird.
This was a secret operation.

20:25.491 --> 20:29.193
Only Hunters knew about it,
and we don't rat on each other.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.762
You didn't tell anyone else
about the operation, right?

20:33.099 --> 20:34.265
Right?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.835
Guys! We have big new...

20:37.904 --> 20:40.638
- It's just you.
- Thanks?

20:40.707 --> 20:41.973
Guys, we have big news!

20:42.041 --> 20:44.075
Well, we have even bigger news.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.310
- Fine, you go first.
- No, you go first.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.280
- No, you go first...
- Is anyone gonna address

20:49.349 --> 20:51.415
that these two are dressed
like living statues?

20:51.484 --> 20:54.485
Well, it's a long story.
There was eavesdropping, Rinus,

20:54.554 --> 20:57.555
candy and apple
and even more candy cake.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.324
A tourist, a puppy!

21:00.393 --> 21:01.926
We're going off track!

21:01.995 --> 21:03.060
Sal and I have discovered something

21:03.129 --> 21:05.229
really, really important.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.931
We've discovered the most importantist.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.232
- That's not a word.
- Yes, it is.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.001
It means the most important
of all-import.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.168
That's also not a word.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.837
Yes, it is. Read it in the dictionary!

21:12.905 --> 21:15.006
I've read the dictionary 16 times!

21:18.177 --> 21:21.279
All right! Everyone listen up!

21:21.347 --> 21:22.680
On the count of three,

21:22.749 --> 21:25.549
both of you can say
your important news, okay?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.120
One, two...

21:29.188 --> 21:31.289
One of the relatives is a mole!
