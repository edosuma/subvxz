01:13.230 --> 01:14.560
so...

01:14.630 --> 01:16.630
you're on your way
to a ball game.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.060
yep. it's a little treat
for jake's birthday.

01:19.130 --> 01:20.800
that was months ago.

01:22.730 --> 01:25.200
we were waiting
for bobble head day.

01:26.860 --> 01:30.830
it's good for jake to see
other bobble heads.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.730
hey, dad, i just checked online.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.460
dodgers are in san francisco
today.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.360
yes, well... we'd beer
get going, then.

01:43.030 --> 01:46.000
it's quite a drive.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.360
must you continue with this
pathetic little charade?

01:49.430 --> 01:52.730
at this point,
we're kind of committed.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.060
all right, all right,
we're not going to a ball game.

01:55.130 --> 01:56.230
we're not?

01:56.300 --> 01:58.130
man, this is the worst
birthday ever.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.500
why do you have to lie to me?

02:00.560 --> 02:03.160
we don't have to.
it's a choice we make.

02:03.230 --> 02:06.430
well, you both might find
this all amusing,

02:06.500 --> 02:09.729
but i do have feelings
and i can be hurt.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.600
sorry, mom.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.330
it's just crushing to know

02:13.400 --> 02:15.660
that my own sons
think so little of me.

02:15.730 --> 02:18.260
really? after
all this time?

02:18.330 --> 02:19.600
charlie.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.060
we're both sorry.

02:21.130 --> 02:22.860
is there anything we can do
to make it up to you?

02:22.930 --> 02:24.760
well, as a matter of fact,
there is.

02:24.830 --> 02:26.830
you just walked
right into that.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.960
teddy is out of town
and i need an escort

02:30.030 --> 02:31.860
for the civic light opera
benefit this evening.

02:31.930 --> 02:34.760
why don't you try one
of those escort services?

02:34.830 --> 02:37.560
charlie, if i were going to pay
$200 an hour for a man,

02:37.630 --> 02:39.460
i would not be taking him
to the opera.

02:39.530 --> 02:41.400
that's fair.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.230
well, i'd love to help
you out, mom,

02:43.300 --> 02:44.560
but i have a date tonight.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.800
oh.

02:46.860 --> 02:50.130
so now it's inflatable sex doll
night at dodger stadium.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.800
no. no, i really have a date.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.900
and the doll was a gag gift
from one of my patients.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.860
charlie, what about you?

02:58.930 --> 03:01.960
i tried it once,
but i prefer a real woman.

03:02.030 --> 03:05.360
do you have plans this evening?

03:05.430 --> 03:07.360
oh, i... well...

03:07.430 --> 03:10.060
woman:
hey, steve.
in here.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.460
as a matter of fact,
i do have plans.

03:12.530 --> 03:15.000
i have a very special lady
friend over for the weekend.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.200
and here she is now.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.530
hey, baby.
hi.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.030
excuse me.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.100
(retching)

03:26.630 --> 03:28.360
isn't she something?

03:29.630 --> 03:31.330
(retching)

03:31.400 --> 03:35.260
okay, but get a town car,
'cause i ain't going sober.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.230
your town car's here.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.200
terrific.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.600
come on.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.160
now i have beeto a lot
of these things with mom,

03:50.230 --> 03:52.330
and i know you think
it's going to be bad,

03:52.400 --> 03:55.430
but believe me, it's going to be
worse than you can even imagine.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.960
you're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

03:58.060 --> 04:00.030
you just love seeing me
unhappy.

04:00.100 --> 04:03.560
well... yeah.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.360
i mean, did you feel
sorry for me

04:05.430 --> 04:07.100
when i had to wear
that cowboy outfit

04:07.160 --> 04:08.430
to her celebrity aids hoedown?

04:08.500 --> 04:09.960
that was different.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.030
how?
it was you.

04:12.100 --> 04:15.230
yeah, well, now it's you.

04:15.300 --> 04:18.000
yippee-ky-yay,
mother-accompanier.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.060
want a few tips?

04:25.130 --> 04:26.860
like what?

04:26.930 --> 04:28.200
well, let's see,

04:28.260 --> 04:30.360
mom likes to starve
herself for a few days

04:30.430 --> 04:32.660
before these events so she
can fit into her gown.

04:32.730 --> 04:36.230
that means she'll be knocking
back vodka gimlets on a
completely empty stomach.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.060
aw, geez.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.060
she can be a cranky drunk.

04:40.130 --> 04:41.400
cranky?

04:41.460 --> 04:45.300
i got bitch-slapped with
my own ten-gallon hat.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.100
so what's the tip?
don't wear a ten-gallon hat?

04:49.160 --> 04:52.460
all you have to do
is bring along a little
baggie of crackers.

04:52.530 --> 04:54.460
you know, saltines, goldfish,

04:54.530 --> 04:57.030
anything you can stuff down her
throat to soak up the booze.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.630
how about a throw pillow?

04:59.700 --> 05:03.460
oh, and whatever you do, don't
let her take off her shoes.

05:03.530 --> 05:04.930
why not?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.200
well, a) you'll be
carrying them all night,

05:07.260 --> 05:10.000
and b) you'll wind up giving her
a foot massage in the lobby,

05:10.060 --> 05:11.860
and that's not something
anybody wants to see.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.660
oh, god.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.960
not to mention the fact that
it puts you on bunion patrol.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.200
anyway, have fun.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.900
i'm off to pick up
a beautiful,

05:23.960 --> 05:26.800
smart, funny, sexually available
woman

05:26.860 --> 05:29.400
who, best of all,
is not my mother.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.400
give it time.
you'll get her there.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.800
in consideration of the evening
you have ahead of you,

05:36.860 --> 05:39.100
i'm gonna let you have that one.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.060
yeah, these are the good times.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.860
another gimlet please.

05:53.930 --> 05:57.130
you sure you don't
want a wheat thin?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.330
mmm, wheaty.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.460
no. i need the liquor
to dull the pain.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.930
my shoes are killing me.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.700
yeah, but they
look wonderful
on your feet,

06:05.760 --> 06:06.930
right where they are now.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.460
oh, look who's over there.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.900
who?

06:10.960 --> 06:13.900
one of the most powerful
union leaders in hollywood.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
what about him?

06:18.330 --> 06:19.860
really? the mob?

06:19.930 --> 06:24.530
yeah, they say he killed
a writer once just to
make a point.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.030
what was the point?

06:26.100 --> 06:28.730
"i can kill a writer."

06:30.560 --> 06:33.430
and the silver-haired man
he's talking to?
yeah?

06:33.500 --> 06:37.600
that is the king of vaginal
rejuvenation surgery,

06:37.660 --> 06:42.630
but interestingly, he's
never used one himself,
rejuvenated or otherwise.

06:42.700 --> 06:46.960
wouldn't that make him the
queen of vaginal surgery?

06:47.030 --> 06:49.400
good for you, charlie.

06:49.460 --> 06:52.530
i wish i'd thought of that,
and from now on i did.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.400
it's yours.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.900
so, what other
dirt you got?

06:56.960 --> 07:00.600
oh, darling, you know i don't
like to speak ill of anyone.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.860
(both laughing)

07:02.960 --> 07:04.560
all right.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.630
bankrupt, embezzler,
tushie tuck,

07:07.700 --> 07:09.460
bigamist, pill freak

07:09.530 --> 07:11.230
and that one over there

07:11.300 --> 07:14.730
underwent surgery to have
a cell phone removed from
his lower intestine.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.860
ouch.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.600
how in the world
did it get there?

07:17.660 --> 07:20.360
one can speculate,
but i have it on
good authority

07:20.430 --> 07:22.030
that it was set to vibrate.

07:24.430 --> 07:26.200
how do you know
all these things?

07:26.260 --> 07:27.500
oh, charlie,

07:27.560 --> 07:30.330
it's my business
to know these things.

07:30.400 --> 07:35.530
high end real estate is all
about gathering information
and forging relationships.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.900
hello, beatrice darling.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.330
lovely to see you.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.860
you two-dollar whore.

07:41.930 --> 07:46.730
you know, mom, it's great
to watch you doing autopsies
when i'm not the cadaver.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.500
half the fun is sharing
with someone you love.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.430
oh, you see
the statuesque
woman over there

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
the one with
the knockoff
prada handbag?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.630
don't tell me--
she's not a woman.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.860
oh, she's a woman.

07:56.930 --> 07:59.330
she's an amazing woman.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.460
she built a children's
hospital in guatemala.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.860
yeah, and...?

08:03.930 --> 08:06.300
once they're healthy
enough to walk,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.430
she flies them to los angeles

08:08.500 --> 08:10.700
and leases them out
to celebrities as
household slaves.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.160
hello, dear.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.830
i'm trying to
sell her home.

08:15.900 --> 08:20.100
it's hard to put a good spin
on "media room slash dungeon."

08:27.060 --> 08:29.130
i'm sorry, alan,
i can't do this.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.230
sure you can.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.630
i mean, you are,

08:31.700 --> 08:33.360
and if you'll allow
me to say so,

08:33.429 --> 08:34.960
you're pretty good at it.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.730
it's not you, it's me.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.299
yeah, right.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.630
what is that supposed to mean?

08:39.700 --> 08:43.400
sharon, i have been rejected
by...

08:43.460 --> 08:46.160
32 different women in my life.

08:46.230 --> 08:49.000
and you know what,
it's never been me.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.660
okay, it's you. feel better?

08:51.730 --> 08:54.260
actually no.

08:54.330 --> 08:55.560
you're a very nice guy.

08:55.630 --> 08:56.860
no, that's even worse

08:56.930 --> 08:58.400
you know what they
say about nice guys.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.700
yes, they finish last.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.600
no, the finish in the shower.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.130
what do you want me to say?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.930
i can't help it if i'm not
sexually attracted to you.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.960
yes, you can.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.600
you just have to
make an effort.

09:09.660 --> 09:12.060
you know those jokes
you don't get right away?

09:12.130 --> 09:15.730
and then in a day
or two you find yourself
laughing and laughing?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.200
that's me.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.860
i'm one of those jokes.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.030
you'll sleep with me now,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.630
and you'll be attracted
to me later.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.330
please, sharon, just,
just give me a chance.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.160
aw, what the hell.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.730
good to see you, dear.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.460
you look marvelous.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.730
for a heroin addict.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.500
let me ask you something.
mm.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.330
if you don't like
any of these people,

09:44.400 --> 09:45.800
why do you come
to these things?

09:45.860 --> 09:47.730
charlie, do you
read the paper?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.260
do you have any idea

09:49.330 --> 09:51.300
what the los angeles
real estate market is like now?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.330
can't say i do.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.430
hey, how are those
feet feeling?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.800
you want to put
your shoes back on?

09:54.860 --> 09:57.760
no one is selling
unless they have to.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.660
which means i have
to be out working
these rooms every night

10:00.730 --> 10:03.230
to learn who's getting
divorced, who's dying,

10:03.300 --> 10:06.460
who can't make bail,
who's crappy sitcom
got cancelled.

10:06.530 --> 10:08.860
let's face it, i'm not
a young woman anymore.

10:08.930 --> 10:11.730
i mean, in the old days
i could find out all that stuff

10:11.800 --> 10:12.930
at home on my back.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.430
evelyn.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.030
margaret.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.030
good to see you.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.330
how's married life?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.260
oh, just one long
honeymoon.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.030
that's because she bangs
a different groom every night.

10:26.060 --> 10:29.000
hi, charlie harper.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.830
oh, my god!

10:30.900 --> 10:34.760
that was amazing.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.600
wasn't that amazing?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.260
i hate myself.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.430
what?

10:40.500 --> 10:42.060
no, no, you were great.

10:42.130 --> 10:44.960
you did a crackerjack job.

10:45.030 --> 10:46.330
why do i do this?

10:46.400 --> 10:49.830
why do i have this constant
need to degrade myself?

10:52.160 --> 10:55.300
would it help to cuddle?

10:55.360 --> 10:58.030
don't touch me.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.460
okay, no touching.

10:59.660 --> 11:04.060
the image of you lying
on top of me

11:04.130 --> 11:06.830
will haunt me forever.

11:10.530 --> 11:12.030
did you want
to be on top?

11:14.130 --> 11:15.700
'cause if you give
me a half an hour

11:15.760 --> 11:17.660
and a glass of juice,
we could try that.

11:19.730 --> 11:24.200
hey, hey, dr. phillips,
it's me, sharon.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.030
i did it again!

11:26.100 --> 11:28.700
i don't know why!

11:28.760 --> 11:29.800
i felt sorry for him.

11:31.630 --> 11:35.160
hey, hey, why
don't i whip us up
some french toast?

11:36.660 --> 11:38.700
shut... up.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.900
okay, i'm just gonna get

11:40.960 --> 11:44.460
a nice glass of
cran-apple just in case.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.960
how bad was it?
how bad was it?

11:47.030 --> 11:48.730
i'm in a fold-out bed!

11:56.060 --> 11:57.230
" 0
'morning.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.230
(dejectedly):
'morning.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.400
hey, berta, you're a woman.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.900
where we going with this, zippy?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.230
i was just wondering,
what does it mean

12:06.300 --> 12:09.900
when someone starts crying
uncontrollably after sex?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.600
well, in my experience,

12:11.660 --> 12:13.800
it usually means
the conjugal visit's over.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.500
right, thanks.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.830
what happened, did you get
yourself a weeper?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.500
yeah. yeah, last night.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.500
i've never seen anything
like it before.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.960
that's hard to believe.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.800
(phone ringing)
i got it

12:30.900 --> 12:32.330
hello.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.300
oh, hey, mom, how are you?

12:34.360 --> 12:36.830
<i>yeah, that was fun
last night.</i>

12:36.900 --> 12:40.800
no, i'm not doing
anything. why?

12:40.860 --> 12:42.800
sure, i'd love to go shopping
with you.

12:44.730 --> 12:48.300
great. i'll see you, then.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.460
what?

12:55.860 --> 12:57.430
nothing.
nothing.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.160
hey, hey, mom's not that bad.

13:00.230 --> 13:03.800
in fact, she's kind of fun
to hang out with.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.760
that has to be
the creepiest thing

13:06.830 --> 13:08.200
i've ever heard.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.630
you know, i said
the same thing

13:10.700 --> 13:12.160
to myself just
a couple minutes ago.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.600
* men.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.500
are you sure
you can't stay
for dinner?

13:20.560 --> 13:23.000
oh, i'd love to, sweetie,
but teddy's back in town,

13:23.060 --> 13:25.460
and mommy plans
to get laid tonight.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.030
good for you.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.360
please, give him
my best.

13:28.430 --> 13:31.000
<i>only after i give
him my best.</i>

13:32.100 --> 13:33.830
hello?

13:33.900 --> 13:34.960
oh, hi, alan.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.700
don't forget your little giftie.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.330
you bought him a giftie?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.830
just my way of saying thank you
for taking me to lunch.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.200
you took her to lunch?

13:42.260 --> 13:44.660
i must have gained
five pounds.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.860
oh, stop!
you have a terrific figure.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.430
(girlishly):
thank you.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.160
are you high?

13:51.230 --> 13:53.660
it never hurts
to pay a compliment

13:53.730 --> 13:54.830
to someone you care about.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.800
yeah, you should
try it once in a while.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.700
it might cut down
on that post-coital weeping.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.730
how'd you know about that?

14:01.800 --> 14:04.330
berta told me,
i told mom.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.560
your brother
and i don't have
any secrets.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.560
<i>maybe i'm high.</i>

14:11.630 --> 14:14.400
okay, well,
i must be off.

14:14.460 --> 14:18.230
places to go, houses to sell,
new widows to cold-call.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.830
oh, oh, that reminds me.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.760
uh, uh, charlie, some woman
named margaret called,

14:21.830 --> 14:22.760
looking for you.

14:22.830 --> 14:24.160
margaret?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.360
oh, yeah, honeymoon
margaret from last night.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.060
charlie, the woman's
husband is one

14:29.130 --> 14:30.100
of my biggest clients.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.730
oh, mom!

14:31.800 --> 14:34.430
please, i'm not asking
as your mother.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.360
i'm asking as your friend.

14:36.430 --> 14:40.630
all right, as a friend,
hands off.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.460
thank you, darling.

14:43.530 --> 14:45.030
i love you.
see ya, alan.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.100
i guess
i'll just throw this away.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.060
da-da-da-da-da-da!

14:50.130 --> 14:52.260
what? you're not gonna
call her, are you?

14:52.330 --> 14:55.260
well, it's a bit of a dilemma.

14:55.330 --> 14:58.060
on the one hand, there's this
beautiful available woman...

14:58.130 --> 14:59.400
she's married.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.360
but according to mom,
not a fanatic about .

15:02.800 --> 15:06.130
so, am i the kind of guy
who would go back on his word

15:06.200 --> 15:09.330
to his own mother just for a
really hot one-night stand?

15:11.330 --> 15:13.230
is that a rhetorical question?

15:13.300 --> 15:14.900
tell you what.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.700
we'll leave it to chance.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.560
if i miss, i'll take
the high road.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.330
if it goes in,
i'll call margaret.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.760
i guess it's fate.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.700
* men.

15:57.460 --> 15:58.700
are you ready for me?

15:58.760 --> 16:02.060
(english accent):
oh, bravo.

16:07.930 --> 16:09.600
mm...

16:09.660 --> 16:11.160
just to be clear,

16:11.230 --> 16:13.660
this is a tit-for-tat
kind of deal, right?

16:13.730 --> 16:16.030
your husband cheated on you,
the rotten bastard,

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
and now you're
cheating on him?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.360
no, he never cheated on me.

16:19.430 --> 16:22.700
oh, so, what, he's mean to you,
he's abusive?

16:22.760 --> 16:27.500
, he's a doll.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.660
is he gay?

16:28.730 --> 16:31.000
not at all.

16:31.060 --> 16:34.430
was he in some sort of bizarre
sort of hunting accident?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.860
what?

16:35.930 --> 16:38.600
you know, fell crotch first
into an open bear trap?

16:38.660 --> 16:42.100
no, he's all man.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.860
so then why are you doing this?

16:44.930 --> 16:47.260
well, it's very simple.

16:47.330 --> 16:49.930
i like having sex
with strangers.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.700
oh. well, good for you.

16:55.830 --> 16:57.900
is your husband hiding
somewhere watching us?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.160
no, he's in dallas
on business.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.930
charlie, are we gonna
do this or what?

17:02.000 --> 17:06.230
actually, i...
i don't think i can.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.700
why not?

17:07.760 --> 17:11.400
well, i kind of promised
my mother i wouldn't.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.030
your mother?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.329
who's also my friend.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.060
so what do you want
to do?

17:18.930 --> 17:20.300
i tell you what.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.230
we'll leave it
to chance.

17:23.300 --> 17:28.260
if i nail this,
then, you know, ditto.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.060
(door slams)

17:30.130 --> 17:31.230
man:
margaret!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.260
oh, god!

17:32.330 --> 17:33.300
who's that?

17:33.360 --> 17:34.100
who do you think?

17:34.160 --> 17:36.060
another stranger?

17:36.130 --> 17:37.300
it's my husband. get out!

17:37.360 --> 17:40.160
right.

17:40.230 --> 17:41.660
where the hell should i go?

17:41.730 --> 17:43.100
out the window.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.430
are you crazy?
i'm not going out the window.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
he's an ex-marine.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.830
i'm going out the window.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.300
oh, damn!

17:56.630 --> 17:58.060
(doorbell rings)

17:59.800 --> 18:01.130
hi.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.200
sharon, um, what's up?

18:04.260 --> 18:06.130
i was hoping we could talk.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.430
oh... sure.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.460
may i come in?

18:09.530 --> 18:11.760
okay.

18:11.830 --> 18:13.330
thanks.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.960
i'm kind of surprised
to see you.

18:15.030 --> 18:16.160
i know.

18:16.230 --> 18:17.660
i behaved really
badly the other night.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.000
you were a little emotional.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.730
i wasn't a little emotional.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.360
i was borderline psychotic.

18:23.430 --> 18:27.260
oh. since you brought it up,
i'd say you crossed that border

18:27.330 --> 18:28.930
with ten more crazy people
in your trun

18:29.000 --> 18:32.200
i know. i'm so sorry.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.600
i get like that sometimes.

18:33.660 --> 18:36.360
it's a combination
of low self-esteem.

18:36.430 --> 18:38.760
low blood sugar
and mixing red wine

18:38.830 --> 18:40.660
with my dog's painkillers.

18:40.730 --> 18:43.660
uh-huh.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.460
uh, i once took my cold
medication with a mimosa.

18:49.530 --> 18:50.800
spaced me out the whole day.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.830
so you forgive me?

18:52.900 --> 18:54.030
oh, absolutely.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.900
oh, thank you, alan.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.160
don't mention it.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.160
mm, what are we doing?

19:06.230 --> 19:08.360
i'd like to make it up to you.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.830
do you really think
that's a good idea?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.930
i mean, last time
it didn't work out so well.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.060
please, alan,
just give me another chance.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.560
oh, what the hell.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.630
margaret (annoyed):
i thought you were in dallas.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.060
i was. i got a phone call
telling me to come home

19:30.130 --> 19:31.060
and check on my wife.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.200
from who?

19:32.260 --> 19:33.560
that's not important.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.500
this marriage is over.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.000
i want you out
of my house.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.260
well, i'm not leaving.

19:38.330 --> 19:40.060
well, you have to
because i'm selling it.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.630
in this market?
are you crazy?

19:41.700 --> 19:42.900
i've got
a great realr,

19:42.960 --> 19:45.100
and she assures me
i can get top dollar.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.100
you've already talked
to a realtor?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.960
who do you think
called me in dallas?

19:49.030 --> 19:50.400
and she's not just
my realtor.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.130
she's my friend.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.130
oh, man!

19:57.260 --> 19:58.830
* men.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.700
sharon:
i hate you!

20:01.760 --> 20:04.760
you're a pig
and you use me!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.360
she's cute.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.700
yes, she is.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.560
so, how's it going?

20:16.630 --> 20:19.560
well, we're trying
to make it work.

20:19.630 --> 20:22.400
good for you.

20:22.460 --> 20:23.800
so how's your night?

20:23.860 --> 20:25.230
you'd be proud of me.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.430
i took the high road.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.560
congratulations.

20:27.630 --> 20:28.860
didn't matter.

20:28.930 --> 20:31.260
it rarely does.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.260
you're telling me
that mom knew

20:38.330 --> 20:39.900
you were going
to sleep with that woman,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.400
and called the husband
so that he'd catch her
in the act?

20:42.460 --> 20:45.830
yep. the marriage ends
and mom gets a big commission

20:45.900 --> 20:46.830
for selling their house.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.500
wow.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.030
she's an evil genius, alan.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.500
if she lived in gotham city,
batman would be toast.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.300
hey, isn't that
your new girlfriend?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
where?

21:01.430 --> 21:03.260
over there.

21:03.330 --> 21:07.860
walking into the ocean
with all her clothes on.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.060
oh, yeah.

21:10.130 --> 21:12.600
she gets a little suicidal
after we have sex.

21:14.130 --> 21:16.600
yeah, yeah, ha-ha.

21:16.660 --> 21:19.100
well, i'd better go
pull her in.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.830
ask if she's got a friend.
