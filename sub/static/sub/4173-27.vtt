(GASPS)
I've got an idea!

08:39.810 --> 08:43.946
My brothers are probably
building something
in our backyard right now,

08:43.948 --> 08:47.016
and we can use
the surveillance satellite
to catch them doing it!

08:47.018 --> 08:47.916
Come on!

08:47.918 --> 08:50.085
I was wondering
how long that would take.

08:51.688 --> 08:53.656
Just let me punch in
my address...

08:54.090 --> 08:56.959
(GASPS) Oh, my gosh!
I knew it! Look at that thing!

08:56.961 --> 08:58.394
Wow. What is it?

08:58.396 --> 09:00.629
It's an eye in the sky bust!

09:00.631 --> 09:02.331
Come on,
let's go get my mom.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.067
Okay, Ferb, turn it off.
Let's take a little break.

09:07.003 --> 09:09.438
(BUFORD GRUNTING)

09:09.706 --> 09:10.705
You okay, Buford?

09:10.707 --> 09:13.509
I'm having
the time of my life!
Is anybody else hungry?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.678
I am!
Come on, let's go see
what's in the kitchen.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.450
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Oh no!
Oh, no, no! Not again!

09:21.452 --> 09:24.119
(CLANGING)
Ow, my head!
Ow, my head again!

09:24.721 --> 09:26.589
Ow! Now I forgot math.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.691
Ow! There goes Social Studies.

09:29.059 --> 09:29.992
Oh, good! They're back!

09:31.061 --> 09:32.661
This way, Mom.

09:32.663 --> 09:33.829
Just see for yourself.

09:33.997 --> 09:37.032
Oh, wow! It's our house.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.367
And you can see the boys!

09:38.369 --> 09:40.002
And their
little skateboards.

09:40.437 --> 09:41.670
Hi, boys!

09:41.672 --> 09:43.873
They can't hear you,
you know.
I know.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.774
Hi! Whoo-hoo!

09:46.009 --> 09:47.843
Hey! Foam Town's gone.

09:47.845 --> 09:50.446
You say that like
it doesn't happen every day.

09:50.448 --> 09:53.015
And you say that
like an angry old prospector.

09:53.017 --> 09:54.483
What does that
even mean?

09:54.485 --> 09:56.118
I stand by that metaphor.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.020
Finally, Daisy,
we're here.

09:58.022 --> 10:02.024
Our new home!
Lots of elbow-room
and no one to bother us.

10:02.026 --> 10:06.128
The last frontier!
A place where a man
and his donkey can...

10:06.863 --> 10:07.862
Dang it!

10:07.864 --> 10:10.833
Come on, Daisy,
we're heading west.

10:10.967 --> 10:13.035
(DOOFENSHMIRTZ SCREAMING)

10:13.037 --> 10:15.137
Perry the Platypus!
Welcome to Saint Louis.

10:15.139 --> 10:17.907
Now, do something
about this bat, please!

10:19.075 --> 10:19.974
(SQUEAKING)

10:19.976 --> 10:22.878
(YELPS)
Well, at least I lost
my fear of bats.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.113
(CRASHING)
(GRUNTS)

10:24.115 --> 10:25.313
WAITRESS: Oh, it's you again.

10:25.315 --> 10:26.916
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: (SCREAMING)
Go away, go away, go away!

10:26.918 --> 10:29.118
WAITRESS: Oh,
just stop it.
