WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:04.268
Ah, this beautiful carol
takes me back.

00:04.303 --> 00:05.603
Mumsy would hum it

00:05.705 --> 00:07.071
while she baked gingerbread,

00:07.139 --> 00:09.707
till she realized that
the oven was set too high,

00:09.775 --> 00:11.809
and then
the screaming would start.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.145
Oh, I love Christmas.

00:14.213 --> 00:16.114
Salem, I hate to
throw a wet Yule log

00:16.181 --> 00:18.449
on your warm hearth
of Christmas memories

00:18.518 --> 00:21.585
but Zelda and I
aren't getting you
an 18-wheel big rig.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.487
But it's all I asked for.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.690
Face it. You're
bad with gears.

00:25.758 --> 00:28.660
Fine. I don't need your gifts
because this year

00:28.728 --> 00:32.229
my true love is sending me
<i>The 12 Days of Christmas.</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:33.898
Who is your true love?

00:33.966 --> 00:35.733
<i>Moi.</i> I ordered it

00:35.768 --> 00:38.636
from the Other Realm's
on-line 89-cent store.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.004
Oh, I love
the 89-cent store

00:40.072 --> 00:42.006
except for that
exact-change rule.

00:42.075 --> 00:46.344
It's a beautiful way for me
to tell me, "I love me."

00:46.379 --> 00:49.413
Oh! This endless cold snap
is making <i>me</i> snap.

00:49.481 --> 00:51.716
This is the worst
time of year.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.551
You're not anti-Christmas
again, are you?

00:53.653 --> 00:56.521
No. I'm anti-windy, subfreezing,
post-apocalyptic weather.

00:56.588 --> 00:58.122
I <i>love</i> Christmas.

00:59.725 --> 01:01.525
Oh. Salem, it says here

01:01.593 --> 01:04.295
your first <i>12 Days of Christmas</i>
present is about to arrive.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.332
SALEM:
Danny Bonaduce!

01:08.367 --> 01:11.435
This is the best Partridge
in a pear tree I could ask for.

01:11.504 --> 01:12.903
Happy holidays,
everyone.

01:13.005 --> 01:14.439
Cool. Eggnog.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.973
You got any ham?

01:16.041 --> 01:17.141
Back...

01:17.243 --> 01:18.676
in the tree, Bonaduce.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.446
I got to get a better agent.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.783
Okay, I am terrified
of going outside.

01:58.850 --> 02:00.585
If I see my breath
one more time,

02:00.653 --> 02:02.187
I'm going to smack it
upside its head.

02:02.254 --> 02:03.722
MAN (ON RADIO):
And now it's time

02:03.856 --> 02:05.589
for WWBG's
Christmas getaway contest.

02:05.658 --> 02:06.691
The first caller to answer
this question correctly

02:06.758 --> 02:08.793
will win four free tickets
for a week-long trip

02:08.860 --> 02:11.195
to tropical Jamaica,
starting Christmas day.

02:11.263 --> 02:13.731
What? Jamaica?
Four tickets?

02:13.766 --> 02:15.099
One, two, three... and a mortal.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.367
We could bring Harvey!

02:16.502 --> 02:18.336
Oh, wait.
We have to win it first.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.004
The subject is science.

02:20.072 --> 02:22.006
Oh, science-- we won!

02:22.108 --> 02:23.341
Aunt Zelda, just answer it.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.443
Sabrina, I don't know
everything about science.

02:25.511 --> 02:26.344
You think you do.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.013
Here's our question:

02:29.115 --> 02:31.749
What parameter measures
the relative magnitude

02:31.784 --> 02:35.119
of viscous forces to coriolis
forces in the rotating flow

02:35.187 --> 02:36.721
of viscous
incompressible fluids?

02:36.789 --> 02:38.790
Well, everyone and his donkey
knows that.

02:38.857 --> 02:39.791
Eckman number.

02:39.858 --> 02:40.858
That's correct.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.060
¶ We're going to Jamaica ¶

02:42.127 --> 02:43.494
¶ We're going
to Jamaica. ¶

02:43.563 --> 02:45.362
This man says
we're going to Jamaica.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.465
Oh, my gosh. Harvey and I
are going to have so much fun.

02:47.532 --> 02:48.800
And I'm sure
there's old age stuff

02:48.868 --> 02:50.068
for you guys to do there, too.

02:50.102 --> 02:51.602
Sabrina, Zelda
won the tickets.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.905
She should pick the
mortal of her choice.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.540
I vote for Antonio Banderas.

02:55.607 --> 02:56.807
Oh, please.

02:57.777 --> 02:58.943
Of course Harvey can come.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.078
Thank you, Aunt Zelda.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.347
You're the greatest aunt
who ever lived.
Aw.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.648
Don't worry. Second place
is nothing to be ashamed of.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.852
(bell ringing)

03:07.920 --> 03:10.454
So, Harvey, you have
any plans for Christmas?

03:10.556 --> 03:11.856
Well, my mom's taking

03:11.923 --> 03:14.225
my little brother and the baby
to visit Grandma,

03:14.293 --> 03:16.794
so that means it'll just be
me, Dad and his patented

03:16.862 --> 03:19.130
"the working man never
gets a break" speech.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.064
Fantastic. Well, I mean

03:20.099 --> 03:21.065
I have a great
surprise for you.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.634
Just don't make
any plans for a week

03:22.702 --> 03:24.135
starting Christmas day, okay?

03:24.170 --> 03:25.470
Well, I was
going to go

03:25.538 --> 03:27.171
to the Freddy Krueger marathon
at the revival house.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.773
No, no, no. Don't
buy tickets for that.

03:28.774 --> 03:31.409
Do you hear me? Don't make
plans. Do not make plans.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.111
Okay, I won't make plans.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.779
No, no, even planning
not to make plans

03:34.846 --> 03:36.147
smacks of making plans.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.348
Don't.

03:37.416 --> 03:38.750
(wind gusting)

03:38.818 --> 03:40.218
Ooh...

03:40.285 --> 03:43.688
Oh... I have never seen
the clock shop so busy.

03:43.789 --> 03:45.623
My feet are
killing me.

03:45.691 --> 03:47.125
Oh, my cheeks are killing <i>me.</i>

03:48.327 --> 03:49.860
From smiling
at the customers.

03:49.928 --> 03:52.396
Pretending to be polite
is so exhausting.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.566
SALEM:
Look at these two turtle doves.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.967
They're just turtles
with wings stapled on.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.870
Since when did
the 89-cent store

03:58.937 --> 04:01.539
start selling cheap
and shoddy merchandise?

04:01.540 --> 04:03.708
Maybe they really can fly.

04:03.775 --> 04:07.345
No, they'd have
to be alive to do that.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.813
Ready?

04:11.217 --> 04:13.317
This almost makes me
wish I wasn't Muslim.

04:13.352 --> 04:14.752
Yeah, but you'd miss
the flat bread.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.120
Should we leave
the tree naked?

04:16.221 --> 04:18.156
No, children might see it.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.934
Hey!

04:30.001 --> 04:34.772
Sabrina, tell your aunt Zelda
that Grammy's going to Vegas

04:34.807 --> 04:36.240
and she will not take me.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.910
So, now that Zelda
is off to Jamaica

04:38.977 --> 04:42.179
I'm spending
another Christmas alone.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.647
I'm sorry.
Oh, and you
can add this.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.149
(blows raspberry)

04:47.752 --> 04:48.920
What was that?

04:48.988 --> 04:51.655
My principal-slash-
aunt's boyfriend,

04:51.691 --> 04:53.424
and it's sort of my fault
that he's going to be

04:53.492 --> 04:54.926
alone-slash-sad on Christmas.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.094
Yeah, see, I would have blamed
the personality.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.297
Maybe I should talk to him.

04:59.398 --> 05:02.066
(evil laughter)

05:05.571 --> 05:09.407
I ho-ho-hope you all
enjoy the holidays.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.275
(cackles)

05:11.310 --> 05:12.543
(laughing)

05:12.611 --> 05:14.812
They're the
three French
hens I ordered,

05:14.847 --> 05:17.048
and they're not
what I had in mind at all.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.119
Okay, I give up
trying to keep pace

05:21.186 --> 05:22.486
with teen fashion.

05:22.554 --> 05:23.487
It's for Jamaica--

05:23.555 --> 05:25.223
Harvey and I are
going to frolic with the fishes.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.058
I mean, since we can't gamble.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.559
MAN (ON RADIO):
We interrupt this program

05:28.627 --> 05:29.660
to bring you a special
weather bulletin.

05:29.728 --> 05:30.795
Due to severe winter conditions,

05:30.862 --> 05:32.029
all airports
on the eastern seaboard

05:32.097 --> 05:33.731
have been closed indefinitely.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.066
No! You can't do that!

05:35.134 --> 05:37.902
You can't ruin
mine and Harvey's vacation!

05:38.037 --> 05:39.103
I know you're
disappointed,

05:39.171 --> 05:40.538
but look on
the bright side.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.973
It'll be a
white Christmas.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.207
That's pretty cool, huh?

05:43.309 --> 05:44.842
And we'll all
be together.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.110
That's the
important thing.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.845
Oh, you're talking crazy talk.

05:49.114 --> 05:51.382
Great. I've just been
called "crazy"

05:51.483 --> 05:53.484
by someone in
a rubber suit.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.854
No two snowflakes are alike,
my butt.

05:55.921 --> 05:59.624
You're all united in your
mission to ruin my Christmas!

05:59.725 --> 06:01.559
You know,
Mark Twain once said,

06:01.627 --> 06:03.494
"Gee, this
mustache itches."

06:03.562 --> 06:06.563
And he also said, "Everyone
talks about the weather

06:06.631 --> 06:08.966
but no one
does anything about it."

06:09.034 --> 06:10.135
Oh, so what you're saying is

06:10.202 --> 06:12.103
I should use my magic
to change the weather?

06:12.171 --> 06:13.237
What a great idea.

06:13.272 --> 06:14.205
Hmm.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.306
So that I may be able

06:15.373 --> 06:16.474
to travel freely

06:16.542 --> 06:18.810
send the snow away,
I mean it really.

06:20.479 --> 06:22.580
The snow! It stopped!

06:22.648 --> 06:23.781
It stopped!

06:28.620 --> 06:31.522
Looks like
the spell
went wrong

06:31.557 --> 06:32.790
in an unexpected way.

06:32.858 --> 06:35.626
How <i>unusual.</i>

06:35.694 --> 06:37.995
This look is not going to work
with my new bikini.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.132
We're swamped,
and we're shorthanded.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.134
Why do they only
loan prisoners out

06:44.203 --> 06:46.738
to clean highways?

06:46.806 --> 06:48.606
Let's get some help
from the Other Realm.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.574
To help us cope with
the Christmas rush

06:50.676 --> 06:51.943
send us workers
in a hurry--

06:52.010 --> 06:53.210
in other words, mush.

06:55.981 --> 06:57.481
You two look
like Santa's elves.

06:57.516 --> 07:00.184
The uniforms always
give us away.

07:00.252 --> 07:01.319
I'm Powell.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.720
This is Pressburger.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.655
It says here you left
Santa's workshop

07:04.723 --> 07:06.023
over creative differences.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.024
Please elaborate.

07:07.159 --> 07:08.226
I don't want
to slam Santa,

07:08.294 --> 07:09.860
but let me put it
to you this way--

07:09.862 --> 07:11.762
he doesn't have much
of a sense of humor

07:11.830 --> 07:14.065
when it comes
to fat jokes, not
even the funny ones.

07:14.132 --> 07:17.000
And that kiss between me and
Mrs. Claus-- there was mistletoe

07:17.068 --> 07:18.969
all over the workshop,
for crying out loud.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.605
So tell me about
your years at Harvard.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.641
Complete
fabrication.

07:23.742 --> 07:25.676
Thank goodness.
You're hired.

07:27.512 --> 07:29.513
Christmas elves!

07:29.582 --> 07:31.849
What a great
promotional gimmick.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.118
Hey, lady, Sensurround
was a gimmick; we work here.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.490
I'm feeling a little warm.

07:39.558 --> 07:41.993
Turn the air conditioning
all the way up before I melt.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.027
Hurry!
Okay, okay!

07:43.095 --> 07:44.962
Boy, whenever
the molecular structure

07:45.030 --> 07:46.397
of your body
changes,

07:46.465 --> 07:48.666
you become
really irritable.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.868
I'm remembering

07:49.935 --> 07:52.436
a formula I learned
in seventh-grade science.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.905
A burning hot electrical bulb
equals <i>heat!</i>

07:54.974 --> 07:56.040
Don't worry, Sabrina.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.676
I'll figure out a way
to keep you cool

07:58.744 --> 08:01.245
until you can figure out a way
to reverse the spell.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.349
Figuring stuff out
is not our strong suit, is it?

08:05.384 --> 08:06.717
Hey, stop
drinking that!

08:06.785 --> 08:08.952
That's my unreconstituted
right leg.

08:10.356 --> 08:11.355
Sabrina?

08:11.423 --> 08:12.323
What happened?

08:12.391 --> 08:13.691
What's with
the puddle?

08:13.759 --> 08:15.993
I, uh, had a little accident.

08:21.767 --> 08:22.867
We can't
reverse
the spell.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.468
The only way
to plead your case

08:24.537 --> 08:27.071
is to go directly
to Mother Nature.
Can we do it now?

08:27.139 --> 08:28.640
In the words
of another famous witch--

08:28.707 --> 08:30.507
I'm melting!

08:30.575 --> 08:32.009
Hello, Steve?
Hurricane Steve?

08:32.077 --> 08:33.544
Yeah, this is Mother Nature.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.346
I need you to make a swing
through the Virgin Islands

08:36.414 --> 08:37.582
later this week.

08:37.649 --> 08:38.883
Don't give me any of that

08:38.951 --> 08:40.784
"I'm just a tropical storm"
business.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.520
Get off your tailwinds
and get down there, pronto.
(knocking)

08:43.589 --> 08:44.889
Mother Nature?

08:44.957 --> 08:45.923
Um...

08:45.991 --> 08:46.958
we're sorry to bother you.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.826
She's Zelda Spellman,
I'm Hilda Spellman

08:48.894 --> 08:51.295
and this is
our niece Sabrina.
Hey!

08:51.363 --> 08:52.330
Sorry for my appearance.

08:52.398 --> 08:53.998
I'm a little pail right now.
(rimshot plays)

08:54.066 --> 08:55.432
Oh, I know you. You're
the selfish little brat

08:55.500 --> 08:56.700
who changed the weather.

08:56.768 --> 08:57.835
SABRINA:
Yeah, but that's all

08:57.903 --> 08:59.437
water under the bridge.

08:59.505 --> 09:00.804
In fact, <i>I'm</i> water
under the bridge.
(rimshot plays)

09:00.872 --> 09:03.374
This spell always
makes people talk in
puns-- I hate that.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.942
And you should know
that the snow

09:05.009 --> 09:06.244
was stopping
tonight anyway.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.711
Whoo-hoo.
I'm Jamaica-bound.

09:07.779 --> 09:08.779
In a Thermos.
(rimshot plays)

09:08.847 --> 09:10.247
What Sabrina did
was wrong

09:10.315 --> 09:12.283
but she <i>is</i>
a first-time offender.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.684
Can't you please
change her back?

09:13.751 --> 09:15.219
Teenagers are enough
of a handful

09:15.287 --> 09:17.288
without them clogging
our drainage systems.

09:17.355 --> 09:18.489
Oh, it is Christmastime,

09:18.557 --> 09:20.625
and I don't want to be
unseasonably mean,

09:20.692 --> 09:21.859
so, okay.

09:25.997 --> 09:27.631
Ah, thanks.

09:27.699 --> 09:29.366
Well, I'm sure there's a third
world town you need to reduce

09:29.434 --> 09:30.634
to rubble
so we better get going.

09:30.702 --> 09:31.835
Just a minute, young lady.

09:31.903 --> 09:33.037
You're not getting
off that easily.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.139
I'm going to punch some data
into my super-computer,

09:35.207 --> 09:36.807
which will scientifically decide

09:36.875 --> 09:38.642
the most severe punishment
for you.

09:38.710 --> 09:42.013
Oh, no. What terrible fate
awaits me?

09:42.080 --> 09:44.182
Not a tornado!

09:44.249 --> 09:47.485
Ow! Ow! Not hail!

09:47.552 --> 09:50.521
Oh, no, not lightning!

09:52.357 --> 09:53.523
(computer trilling)

09:53.591 --> 09:55.593
You must spend time
with a certain Willard Kraft

09:55.660 --> 09:56.660
and cheer him up.

09:56.728 --> 09:57.628
No!

09:58.663 --> 09:59.897
How about a little hail?!

09:59.964 --> 10:01.165
Oh, be strong,
honey.

10:01.232 --> 10:02.466
Be strong.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.635
Here, wear this Christmas tree
pin on your lapel.

10:04.703 --> 10:07.037
When the star on
the pin lights
up like this

10:07.106 --> 10:08.439
Mr. Kraft will be
sufficiently cheered,

10:08.540 --> 10:09.874
and your punishment
will be over.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.909
Great. On top
of everything else,

10:11.976 --> 10:13.944
I have to wear
an ugly accessory.

10:14.012 --> 10:15.713
I can't find Mr. Kraft anywhere,

10:15.847 --> 10:18.015
and I've called
all his usual haunts--

10:18.083 --> 10:19.283
his home, Custer's steak house

10:19.350 --> 10:21.385
Pat Buchanan for President
headquarters...

10:21.420 --> 10:23.220
Have you tried Westbridge High?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.422
Oh, come on. Being at school
during Christmas vacation--

10:25.490 --> 10:26.757
that's beyond pathetic.

10:26.825 --> 10:29.093
That's patholog...
That's where he is!

10:30.495 --> 10:31.395
(rumbling)

10:31.462 --> 10:33.464
Oh-oh-oh...

10:33.532 --> 10:35.933
It's the nine ladies dancing--

10:36.068 --> 10:37.368
nine of the largest,

10:37.436 --> 10:40.171
most ungraceful ladies
you'll ever meet.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.506
Knock it off!

10:41.573 --> 10:44.942
Some of us are trying
to sleep away the morning!

10:45.010 --> 10:46.376
That's odd.

10:46.444 --> 10:48.745
We're missing money
from the cash register.

10:48.813 --> 10:50.247
Well, I know
you didn't take it,

10:50.315 --> 10:52.316
and I know I didn't take it,
so who could it be?

10:52.384 --> 10:54.184
We're going to the bank
to make a deposit.

10:54.252 --> 10:55.353
We'll be back in five.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.387
See ya.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.156
Who could it be?

10:59.223 --> 11:02.626
(chuckling):
Yes. I found some kids

11:02.694 --> 11:05.429
that are qualified
for suspension.

11:05.497 --> 11:06.998
What are you doing here?

11:07.066 --> 11:08.532
Uh, I just came by to see

11:08.600 --> 11:10.101
what your favorite kind
of Christmas food is?

11:10.168 --> 11:11.802
Figgy pudding. Go away.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.270
That's so funny,
because I was thinking

11:13.338 --> 11:15.139
about you this afternoon, and
I was thinking, "He looks like

11:15.206 --> 11:16.707
a figgy pudding
kind of guy," so...

11:18.677 --> 11:20.077
I baked you this.

11:20.145 --> 11:22.380
Do you think I'm a fool?

11:22.448 --> 11:23.881
Rhetorical question?

11:23.948 --> 11:26.550
This was not baked with love
but just to curry favor

11:26.618 --> 11:30.688
with the man in power,
but guess what?

11:30.755 --> 11:32.556
I'm going to eat all of it.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.461
I've got it.

11:37.529 --> 11:39.730
Powell and Pressburger
stole our money.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.667
Hilda, you always suspect
the worst in people.

11:42.734 --> 11:45.636
Come on, have some faith
in your fellow man.

11:46.804 --> 11:48.372
But just in case

11:48.440 --> 11:50.241
the little hooligans
snatched the dough,

11:50.308 --> 11:52.143
let's watch
the surveillance camera.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.714
Even when you hire
people you don't know

11:56.781 --> 11:57.981
on the spur of the moment,

11:58.049 --> 11:59.550
it can still
backfire on you.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.286
Oh, it makes me so mad!

12:02.353 --> 12:04.589
Hilda, this <i>is</i>
the Christmas season.

12:04.656 --> 12:06.290
We must have compassion.

12:06.357 --> 12:07.591
ZELDA:
Powell, Pressburger,

12:07.659 --> 12:09.493
straighten up the
back room, okay?

12:09.561 --> 12:10.727
Sure thing.

12:10.795 --> 12:12.596
"Straighten up
the back room, okay?"

12:12.664 --> 12:14.365
(laughing)

12:15.733 --> 12:17.868
Those felonious
little rogue elves.

12:17.936 --> 12:19.503
Oh, come on,
lighten up.

12:19.571 --> 12:20.504
Look at me.

12:20.572 --> 12:21.505
I'm Hilda.

12:21.573 --> 12:22.740
I own a clock shop.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.042
I pay minimum wage.

12:25.110 --> 12:28.446
Okay. They're sled kill.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.247
(bagpipes and drums
playing Irish music loudly)

12:30.315 --> 12:32.316
12 drummers drumming,
11 pipers piping.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.618
One cat crumbling.

12:34.686 --> 12:36.653
Oh... turn it off.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.122
Turn it <i>off!</i>

12:38.190 --> 12:40.558
SABRINA:
That was good, huh?

12:40.625 --> 12:41.592
Yes, it was.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.893
And you're feeling
cheerful now, huh?

12:42.961 --> 12:44.127
Well, I can feel
the sugar surging

12:44.195 --> 12:46.229
through my body,
giving me comfort.
You can?

12:46.297 --> 12:48.099
Yes, and I can
feel that now

12:48.167 --> 12:51.268
my sugar rush is
officially over.
Oh, no. We're getting

12:51.336 --> 12:53.871
further and further away
from the land of cheerful.

12:53.938 --> 12:56.974
I don't really care
for this time of year.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.810
Oh, I'm never going
to get to Jamaica.

12:59.878 --> 13:02.179
Oh. Okay, let's
snap out of it.

13:02.246 --> 13:03.447
Who wants to go
for a <i>walk?</i>

13:03.515 --> 13:04.415
Not me.

13:04.483 --> 13:05.549
Great. Let's go.

13:05.617 --> 13:07.184
No...

13:07.252 --> 13:09.820
I just want to remind you two
that Christmas

13:09.888 --> 13:11.856
isn't just about getting stuff

13:11.924 --> 13:14.091
or say... <i>money.</i>

13:14.159 --> 13:15.626
It's also about

13:15.693 --> 13:19.763
honesty and overcoming
your bad impulses.

13:19.831 --> 13:20.998
That's a good point.

13:21.065 --> 13:22.432
In fact, we've gone
out of our way

13:22.501 --> 13:24.601
not to get drunk
during business hours.

13:26.871 --> 13:29.440
Oh, we're at Zoo-Zoo's store.

13:29.508 --> 13:30.941
Hi, monkey.

13:31.009 --> 13:33.143
Aunt Zelda, I need
to speak with you alone.

13:33.211 --> 13:34.979
I can't hear.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.714
I have tried everything.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.083
I was pushing him at the park
at the swings just now

13:39.150 --> 13:40.450
and not even so much
as a "whee!"

13:40.518 --> 13:42.286
You've got to help me.

13:42.353 --> 13:45.022
Oh, honey, I'd drop
everything in a second
to help my Willard

13:45.090 --> 13:47.491
but according
to Mother Nature,
I'm not allowed to.

13:47.559 --> 13:50.360
It's your punishment
to cheer him up.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.331
Oh, I can hear again.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.600
Yeah. How's that for
cheerful, good news?

13:56.668 --> 13:58.101
(sighs)
Is this thing on?

13:58.169 --> 14:00.604
Mr. Kraft, why are
you so miserable

14:00.672 --> 14:02.172
at Christmastime?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.475
Because I've never had
a good one--

14:04.542 --> 14:07.111
at least none
that I can remember.

14:07.178 --> 14:08.846
Maybe I can help.

14:10.214 --> 14:12.783
Uh, this area is
for employees only.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.184
What's wrong with me?

14:14.252 --> 14:15.852
Did I just say,
"What's wrong with me?"

14:15.954 --> 14:16.953
because I couldn't hear it.

14:17.021 --> 14:18.221
I'm going to take Mr. Kraft

14:18.289 --> 14:19.856
back through
the grandfather time clock

14:19.958 --> 14:21.592
so that he can remember
a good Christmas

14:21.660 --> 14:23.827
and get out of this funk
and I can go to Jamaica.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.764
All right, well, if you
leave him back there,
I didn't see you.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.298
(tinkling)

14:28.366 --> 14:29.667
Mr. Kraft, uh,
this grandfather clock

14:29.735 --> 14:30.700
will cheer you up.

14:30.768 --> 14:32.069
Thank goodness,
I can hear again.

14:32.136 --> 14:33.036
There is nothing worse

14:33.171 --> 14:34.938
than losing
your <i>hearing!</i>

14:35.006 --> 14:36.173
(grunting)

14:36.240 --> 14:39.109
You see that sad,

14:39.177 --> 14:41.712
lost, lonely looking
boy over there?

14:41.780 --> 14:42.780
The one with the coal?

14:42.847 --> 14:45.415
I'm the even more pathetic kid
next to him.

14:49.387 --> 14:51.121
You think
this is bad?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.790
You should see me a few years
from now at the orphanage.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.026
Oh, no, not an orphanage.

15:01.165 --> 15:02.165
Mr. Kraft, which
one are you?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.300
That's me

15:03.402 --> 15:05.536
on the outside,
as usual.

15:05.637 --> 15:08.772
I didn't have it good
like those orphans.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.641
How I envied them.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.476
Didn't you have
one happy Christmas

15:12.544 --> 15:13.811
in your whole life?

15:13.879 --> 15:15.412
Merry Christmas, Willard.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.548
A sled? Oh, boy.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.451
I wish I'd gotten this
<i>before</i> I moved to Miami,

15:20.519 --> 15:21.819
but I don't care.

15:21.887 --> 15:23.487
This is great!

15:26.391 --> 15:27.725
(sled scraping)

15:27.792 --> 15:30.627
Willard!
You're scratching the pavement!

15:32.430 --> 15:34.498
That was a good Christmas.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.201
Whoo-hoo! I'm going
to Jamaica!

15:37.269 --> 15:40.404
What's that?
Uh...

15:43.475 --> 15:44.808
(no audio)

15:44.876 --> 15:47.544
...and they lived
happily every after.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.881
Who did?
Oh, Mr. Kraft, did
you go deaf again?

15:50.949 --> 15:51.882
Yes.

15:51.949 --> 15:53.650
You know, you had that
glazed look on your face

15:53.718 --> 15:55.419
during my whole story
like you were in some

15:55.486 --> 15:56.786
reflective revealing
daydream.

15:56.854 --> 15:59.590
It was the most powerful
daydream of my life.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.191
You know what, Sabrina?

16:01.259 --> 16:02.660
I think I figured out

16:02.728 --> 16:04.962
the secret
to a happy Christmas.

16:05.029 --> 16:05.963
Really? What is it?

16:06.030 --> 16:07.297
Low expectations.

16:07.365 --> 16:11.735
As long as you look at Christmas
as just one other day

16:11.803 --> 16:15.172
in the long endless
drudgery that is life,

16:15.239 --> 16:19.743
then you won't be disappointed
when joy doesn't come.

16:19.778 --> 16:23.013
Well, I'm glad I could
cheer you up.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.981
Merry Christmas.

16:25.049 --> 16:27.083
Yeah, mer-merry Christmas.

16:33.024 --> 16:34.391
(sighs)

16:34.459 --> 16:37.294
Hilda, there doesn't seem
to be any money missing.

16:37.361 --> 16:40.164
Let's check the
security camera
just to be sure.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.498
That Zelda woman was right.

16:41.566 --> 16:43.633
It was wrong for us
to take that money.

16:43.701 --> 16:44.835
Oh, the little dears.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.336
They put the money back.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.672
You see? I knew
if I just lectured them

16:48.739 --> 16:50.340
it would do them some good.

16:50.408 --> 16:51.975
Wait. Do you
see the lady

16:52.043 --> 16:54.044
who just came
in the store?

16:54.112 --> 16:55.412
Is she shoplifting?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.481
No, no, I think
she's looking.

16:57.548 --> 16:59.316
Oh, well,
thank goodness

16:59.384 --> 17:00.985
for surveillance
cameras.

17:01.052 --> 17:02.653
Yeah.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.855
They were on to us
about the money

17:04.922 --> 17:06.857
but they'll never
miss a clock.

17:06.924 --> 17:08.558
I love this time of year.

17:08.626 --> 17:09.960
(doorbell rings)

17:10.027 --> 17:11.662
Come in.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.329
Hey.

17:13.397 --> 17:14.897
Merry Christmas Eve.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.367
Oh, back at ya.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.069
Here's your present.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.007
Harvey, a
diamond bracelet?

17:24.075 --> 17:27.109
Actually, it's "I can't believe
it's not diamonds."

17:27.178 --> 17:29.246
Twice as shiny
but at a fraction of the cost.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.248
Well, I love it--
it will look great with

17:31.315 --> 17:33.316
my "almost onyx"
necklace you gave me.

17:33.418 --> 17:34.985
Tickets?

17:35.053 --> 17:37.955
Oh, passes to the
Freddie Krueger marathon

17:38.023 --> 17:39.890
at the revival house.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.125
I won't sleep
for a week. Thanks.

17:42.193 --> 17:43.394
Well, speaking
of nightmares

17:43.461 --> 17:45.162
do you want to try the
Christmas cookies I made?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.330
You bet.

17:46.397 --> 17:49.200
I coated my stomach
before I came over.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.967
Movie tickets?

17:51.035 --> 17:53.069
Then who did she give
the extra ticket to?

17:53.137 --> 17:54.104
(doorbell chimes, knocking)

17:55.407 --> 17:57.007
Oh, no.

17:57.074 --> 18:00.044
Zelda Spellman,
you foxy Santa Claus.

18:00.111 --> 18:01.511
A trip to Jamaica.

18:01.579 --> 18:03.881
I have never had such
an incredible present!

18:03.949 --> 18:06.884
Well, you know
what a scamp I am.

18:06.951 --> 18:08.852
Oh, excuse me.
Um, Zellie, don't we need

18:08.920 --> 18:11.087
to speak to
Sabrina alone?

18:11.155 --> 18:12.455
Uh, be right back.

18:12.523 --> 18:14.458
Sabrina.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.995
You gave Willard Kraft
the extra ticket?

18:18.062 --> 18:19.997
And credited
it to me?

18:20.064 --> 18:22.632
Look, Mr. Kraft is the bane of
my existence but for some reason

18:22.700 --> 18:24.667
I feel he should have
at least one happy Christmas.

18:24.735 --> 18:26.169
I don't know what got into me.

18:26.237 --> 18:27.570
It's called
the Christmas spirit.

18:27.638 --> 18:28.739
It's called insanity.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.709
Oh, I can
hear again.

18:32.777 --> 18:34.611
I didn't expect
headphone-related hearing loss

18:34.678 --> 18:36.179
until my 40s.

18:36.247 --> 18:39.083
Well, I guess
we're Jamaica-bound.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.119
Ugh! What ever happened

18:42.187 --> 18:43.721
to the whole global
warming thing?

18:43.788 --> 18:45.155
Cheer up.

18:45.223 --> 18:47.424
I complained
to the 89-cent store,

18:47.559 --> 18:50.126
and they sent me
a baker's dozen of doughnuts.

18:50.194 --> 18:51.929
13 crullers calling.

18:51.996 --> 18:54.097
Oh, yeah.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.666
It's official.

18:56.734 --> 18:58.835
All airports closed.

18:58.903 --> 19:00.437
Well, at least
we all get to stay here

19:00.505 --> 19:01.805
and have a white Christmas.

19:01.872 --> 19:03.340
That's the spirit.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.975
And you know what?

19:05.009 --> 19:07.244
If we can't go
to Jamaica,

19:07.312 --> 19:08.712
then...

19:08.780 --> 19:11.915
we'll bring
Jamaica here.

19:11.983 --> 19:13.317
Yeah, mon!

19:13.384 --> 19:16.186
(playing reggae version
of "Joy to the World")

19:16.254 --> 19:17.554
Wow.

19:17.621 --> 19:20.090
This is way better
than a fruitcake.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.491
Harvey.

19:21.559 --> 19:24.027
Hey, even though
10,000 people are
without electricity

19:24.095 --> 19:25.495
I'm happy you're
snowed in.

19:25.563 --> 19:27.097
I get to spend
Christmas with you.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.531
Well, let's grab
a refreshment

19:28.599 --> 19:30.100
and groove
to the reggae, mon.

19:32.737 --> 19:35.038
Does anybody want
to buy a pair

19:35.106 --> 19:37.273
of slightly-used bermudas?

19:37.341 --> 19:38.943
I really see this, right?

19:39.010 --> 19:40.844
This is not
another daydream?

19:40.912 --> 19:42.646
I'm sorry about the snow,
monkey.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.181
I know how much you wanted
to go to Jamaica.

19:45.249 --> 19:46.516
I do not care.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.352
I am not alone
on Christmas.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.719
Let's boogie!

19:51.222 --> 19:52.288
It was a show.

19:52.356 --> 19:53.324
Get over it.

19:53.391 --> 19:56.126
There was
no real Ruben Kincaid.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.695
(squawking)

20:04.269 --> 20:05.602
Powell, Pressburger.

20:07.371 --> 20:08.738
Oh, what a lovely gesture

20:08.806 --> 20:11.074
but we actually have
a lot of clocks.

20:11.141 --> 20:12.509
Not as many
as you think.

20:12.576 --> 20:14.177
We stole this,
but we're sorry.

20:14.245 --> 20:17.548
Well, the important thing is,
you righted a wrong.

20:17.615 --> 20:20.250
And we heard you had
jerk chicken.

20:21.452 --> 20:22.886
I don't mean to
pick on your elves

20:22.954 --> 20:25.622
but aren't you
mixing themes?

20:26.824 --> 20:28.224
What a great Christmas.

20:28.292 --> 20:30.127
But it's strange how
it started snowing.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.496
Mother Nature said
it was supposed to warm up.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.064
Well, uh...

20:34.132 --> 20:35.566
Wait a minute.

20:35.633 --> 20:36.933
Where's Hilda?

20:37.001 --> 20:38.268
Aunt Hilda?

20:38.336 --> 20:40.070
Yes, I admit it,
I'm selfish.

20:40.138 --> 20:41.371
But there was no way

20:41.439 --> 20:43.506
I was going to Jamaica
with Willard Kraft.

21:08.132 --> 21:10.233
¶ ¶

21:12.136 --> 21:14.638
ALL:
Happy holidays, everybody!
