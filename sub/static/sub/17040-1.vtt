01:25.652 --> 01:27.920
Alright, I'm going to
spray some rosewater.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.521
Okay, take a deep breath.

01:35.628 --> 01:39.298
Take your time getting up.
Let's have some water okay?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.899
Thank you.

01:40.901 --> 01:45.871
Um, Abby? Will you marry me?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.940
Ha ha.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.898
The upstairs toilet
is acting funny.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.566
What?

02:14.568 --> 02:17.736
Upstairs toilet is acting funny.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.805
Oh.

02:20.039 --> 02:22.608
Have you noticed?

02:22.610 --> 02:25.177
No, I guess I haven't
really noticed.

02:32.352 --> 02:37.523
It was making a running
sound like even,

02:37.525 --> 02:41.593
even when it wasn't, just
when it was not in use.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.195
And then it would stop.

02:43.197 --> 02:47.065
Okay, well did you
look in the back.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.201
Like did you look in
the tank of the toilet?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.270
Mm-mm.

02:55.842 --> 03:03.815
Sometimes the chain just falls
off. And you just reattach it.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.651
Is there, is there
anything that I, I can...

03:05.653 --> 03:10.355
No, everything is
everything's under to control.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.424
Okay then.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.133
I'll get it.

03:25.772 --> 03:30.642
Hey Paul Hey Good to see you.

03:30.644 --> 03:40.586
Yeah, I beat my record, by like
two minutes. Oooo...Ah man.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.155
Is everybody in the kitchen?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.860
Are you out of your mind?

03:48.862 --> 03:51.363
A calzone is not the
same as a hot pocket.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.598
Ok, what's the difference then?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.632
There's a huge difference.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.700
Okay, what's the difference?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.235
Ok, you've got your
tomato -based filling

03:56.237 --> 03:58.837
and you've got your
pastry based outer shell.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.406
Hold on, have you ever
even had a calzone?

04:01.408 --> 04:06.478
I got a pizza and I flipped it
over and I called it calzone.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.114
You know what we're going to do?
I'm going to make you a calzone.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.148
Okay.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.183
And you're going to eat it

04:11.185 --> 04:12.951
and then I'm going
to prove you wrong

04:12.953 --> 04:14.620
and you're gonna owe me.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.688
Okay. Deal.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.423
What do you owe me?

04:18.425 --> 04:19.690
I don't know.
What's he gonna owe me?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.760
What should I owe her?

04:22.028 --> 04:23.428
I don't know.

04:23.430 --> 04:28.200
How bout...How bout a beer.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.268
Okay.

04:30.638 --> 04:35.274
And if it turns out to be
like a DiGiorno's Pizza,

04:35.276 --> 04:37.175
just folded over and
thrown in the oven,

04:37.177 --> 04:38.110
what do I get out of it?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.478
Well, I mean, regardless

04:39.480 --> 04:41.813
you're gonna get a delicious
homemade treat so.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.783
What? The calzone?
That's the treat?

04:44.785 --> 04:48.253
Oh, God. Okay. And what
happens if I don't like it?

04:48.255 --> 04:50.555
Then what do I get
out of it? Nothin.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.025
That's just, that's
just not possible.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.192
A homemade treat.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.761
I'm back!

04:56.129 --> 05:00.432
Hello.
Hi.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.567
Smells good!
Mm-mm.

05:03.002 --> 05:08.373
Hey baby. I remembered
the salad dressing.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.575
Why didn't you make the
one that you make? The one...

05:10.577 --> 05:12.144
I didn't have any time.

05:12.146 --> 05:15.247
Just tell me next time
and I'll make it.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.982
Well, then you would
know my secret recipe.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.717
Oh, oh I didn't realize.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.852
The stew smells
amazing. What is that?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.688
Like cinnamon?
Smells so good.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.790
Will you take this?

05:24.792 --> 05:27.059
What is that?
Beef beef stew.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.694
I know, but what's that smell?

05:28.696 --> 05:33.365
Clove?
It's just beef.

05:33.367 --> 05:38.270
So, did you get the mac?
The applications?

05:38.272 --> 05:40.706
I didn't send them.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.108
Are you serious?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.776
Yeah, I'm serious.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.645
What the fuck! Why?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.213
What the fuck?
Give me a break.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.216
What do you mean,
give you a break?

05:51.218 --> 05:53.118
Why didn't you send them?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.420
It's like a really bad time.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.488
It's a great time.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.323
No, it's not a great time.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.258
Why?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.761
We can barely pay Susan, okay.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.463
What does that mean?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.597
What do you mean,
what does it mean?

06:05.599 --> 06:07.766
It means we haven't
had a new client

06:07.768 --> 06:10.669
in forever and all of
Grandpa's clients are dying off.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.504
Yeah, but that's
not your problem.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.239
Yeah, well that's really
easy for you to say.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.607
Yeah it is easy for me to say.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.610
And it's easy for
you to say too.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.645
You don't get it.

06:20.647 --> 06:27.586
Look, I love you. It's
your life. It's your life.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.287
I have to go to the bathroom.

06:29.289 --> 06:36.294
Check these tomatoes, or does
it matter? It doesn't matter.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.463
Dad, will you get
the ah, cornbread?

06:51.644 --> 06:53.712
Hey.
Hey.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.955
Yeah. I think it's an
incredibly good idea.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.258
Are you sure?
Yeah.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.424
You look wan.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.527
Wan?
Hm-mm.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.830
Are you sleeping? You've
got bags. You're all puffy.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.098
Yeah, I'm sleeping.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.101
I should have Bronwen
make an elixir for him.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.472
I have a friend who makes
these incredible energy tonics

07:53.474 --> 07:55.073
that stimulate everything.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.275
Your liver, your
gallbladder, you kidney's...

07:57.277 --> 08:00.979
I don't, I don't think that
elixirs are dad's thing.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.082
Well, maybe not... What
does it taste like?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.150
It tastes like shit.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.620
Garbage, but so good for
you. Cleansing, healing.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.957
Bronwen's amazing.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.792
She did Reiki on me last
month, it was incredible.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.695
Right.
Mm-mm.

08:16.697 --> 08:21.766
You should get Reiki done.
Paul, you would love Reiki.

08:21.768 --> 08:25.203
And, what's Reiki?
I mean, what is it?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.172
It's energy work essentially.

08:27.174 --> 08:32.177
It helps you release emotional
blockages and clear out pathways

08:32.179 --> 08:38.950
and just makes you feel
awesome in general.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.519
Okay.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.823
Paul, how's the practice doing?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.058
Great.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.129
Yeah? Business is booming?

08:51.131 --> 08:54.232
Yeah, we're trucking
along and...

08:54.234 --> 08:58.403
Good. Awesome.

08:58.405 --> 09:02.474
How's the um, the
apartment search going?

09:02.476 --> 09:03.441
Good.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.943
Have you found anything?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.078
Not yet, but I have a few leads.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.481
You have to be out by the first.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.649
I know, I know, I know.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.219
Well, why don't you
just move in with me?

09:19.692 --> 09:21.126
Well, I mean you're at
my house every night.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.260
Well, it's not every night.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.830
I mean, rents really high
right now, you know.

09:25.832 --> 09:29.868
I mean, it just makes sense.

09:29.870 --> 09:34.239
Or, you could move in here

09:34.241 --> 09:40.745
until you find a place
that's suitable.

09:40.747 --> 09:46.585
There's plenty of room, the
door's always open to you.

09:46.587 --> 09:53.191
Thank you brother. That is a
very generous offer Paul um...

09:53.193 --> 09:54.759
Thank you.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.496
I mean it makes sense right?

09:58.498 --> 10:01.032
That's what I'm saying. Right?

10:01.034 --> 10:04.336
Yeah, I mean, you're
going to regret it though,

10:04.338 --> 10:06.471
because I'm a complete
and utter slob.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.772
Like I already don't know that.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.576
I know but once all my
stuff is there. Alright.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.544
So you'll move in.

10:12.546 --> 10:13.712
Yeah.
That's great.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.713
Why not.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.381
And you guys can have
dinner at our house.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.479
And a little tap, tap, tap.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.949
Close and grind and move
side to side for me.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.517
Perfect.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.988
And tap, tap, tap.
One, two, three.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.558
Hold and close, grind
side to side. Perfect.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.193
Alright.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.499
Mirror.

11:16.276 --> 11:21.179
let's just take a look and
see what we've got here.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.747
Uh-huh.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.785
Okay, Mrs Olstead,
be sure to floss.

11:31.323 --> 11:33.758
We'll see you next time.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.764
Who's next?

11:39.766 --> 11:44.836
Um, no one today.
Mrs. Koppleson canceled.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.590
Dad?

12:05.592 --> 12:09.828
Yeah, I was thinking, um.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.131
I think we need some new blood.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.000
We could, could advertise.

12:16.002 --> 12:19.370
That's not, that's
too expensive.

12:19.372 --> 12:24.309
We have to, we have to spend
money to make money right?

12:24.311 --> 12:28.613
I could call, I could do, I
could do some research.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.649
Who would you call?
I don't know.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.753
Look at bus ads or call
some newspapers...

12:34.755 --> 12:38.323
I'm not comfortable with that.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.196
Okay.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.296
You feel good.

13:18.998 --> 13:22.066
Yeah?
Mm-mm.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.771
Ah, it's amazing.

13:30.142 --> 13:37.415
Ah. So, what are his ah? What
are your brother's symptoms?

13:37.417 --> 13:44.722
Oh um, he's really uptight,

13:44.724 --> 13:47.158
Take this.
Thank you.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.462
Judgemental, he's rigid and.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.831
I don't want a
character assasination,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.766
I just want his symptoms.

13:54.768 --> 13:59.938
Oh. He's um, he's
really ah, depleted.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.406
His like energy is gone.

14:01.408 --> 14:06.711
He's all sucked in and wan
and he's not sleeping good.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.479
Okay, I'll give
him a liver tonic

14:08.481 --> 14:11.316
and something for
his gallbladder.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.317
Okay.

14:12.319 --> 14:17.155
Alright. That's not going
to happen but alright.

14:17.157 --> 14:21.059
He really should. I can help
him better if he's here.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.760
How about you?
How are you doing?

14:22.762 --> 14:29.300
You feel good, so
things are good. What?

14:29.302 --> 14:32.403
Jesse asked me to
move in with him.

14:32.405 --> 14:38.476
Yeah, last night in front
of my family at dinner.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.511
Wow.
Yeah.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.547
Wow.
What the F right?

14:42.549 --> 14:47.418
No joke that's. Did
you...are you...you're...

14:47.420 --> 14:49.687
Yeah, I don't know.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.955
Yes, good, good.
I'm flipping out about it.

14:50.957 --> 14:54.859
You wouldn't be you if you
didn't flip out about it.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.961
Its great, it's fine, it's
normal, it's normal.

14:56.963 --> 14:57.962
Really?

14:57.964 --> 15:02.033
I mean, he was supposed to
be my rebound. You know.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.034
Yeah.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.569
Just my get back
in the game guy.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.640
Isn't it awful. Something
beautiful happened.

15:08.642 --> 15:09.641
Is it?

15:09.643 --> 15:11.175
It actually have ...is it?

15:11.177 --> 15:14.579
I dont' know. Is it being tied
down again going to be awesome?

15:14.581 --> 15:18.917
Or is it going to be
like a cage and like...

15:18.919 --> 15:22.587
No, honey. I keep telling you,
I have always told you,

15:22.589 --> 15:26.925
you have something
that, yes started sexually.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.994
And it's grown into
something beautiful.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.763
And that's what happen
for me and Charlie,

15:31.765 --> 15:33.531
we started out
that way and that

15:33.533 --> 15:37.268
was the most meaningful
relationship of my entire life.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.139
And you know what,

15:41.141 --> 15:46.377
I didn't even appreciate
what I had until Charlie past.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.814
It wasn't until after. And I, I,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.883
I just don't want
you to fuck it up.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.752
I don't want you
to fuck it up.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.921
Alright.

15:56.923 --> 16:00.959
Just appreciate it. Ok.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.427
Alright, cheers.
Gratitude.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.695
Gratitude. Appreciate.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.530
What time's your first victim?

16:05.532 --> 16:09.334
Um...Oh, ten minutes ago.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.436
Here take these. Take these.
I mixed these for you.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.104
This is my special blend,
very proud of that.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.139
I'll bring the tonic
down later, okay.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.542
Oh, and I will put your
check in the box.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.277
Oh yeah! Two months.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.312
I know, two months, I'm sorry.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.681
Can I help you?

16:56.683 --> 16:57.982
Um, yeah, Jenny sent me.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.718
She said I could get
a free cleaning.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.388
Oh, ah, Okay. Um, Jenny...

17:03.390 --> 17:05.823
Oh, Henry, you came.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.260
Yeah, it's okay. Come back.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.499
Okay, you ready? Open up.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.200
What, what, what are you doing?

17:16.202 --> 17:18.403
Oh hey dad.
This is Henry.

17:18.405 --> 17:22.106
He ah, we know each
other from Cafe Fiore.

17:22.108 --> 17:26.810
Hello.
Hello.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.279
You know each other how?

17:28.281 --> 17:29.914
Oh, I work there.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.582
He makes my coffee
every morning.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.585
Yeah, I just figured that
the chair was empty,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.588
so I'd just give
him quick polish.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.490
What do you mean?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.726
Well, I didn't want to bother
you, you know. He's my friend,

17:41.728 --> 17:45.730
He hasn't had a
cleaning in, in awhile.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.465
That's not right.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.734
What do you mean?

17:49.736 --> 17:53.838
You don't have the training.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.076
I've seen you do it
like a thousand times.

17:58.078 --> 18:04.215
Well, I think it'd be better
if you stayed on your side.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.518
Don't you?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.668
So, when was the last
time you saw a Dentist?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.603
About five years ago.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.171
Oh, well, you're due.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.843
Ah, G3.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.648
The mirror.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.927
Okay, let's open up
and take a look.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.998
Alright, what have we
got going on here?

19:21.493 --> 19:22.260
I'm going to start
you face down,

19:22.262 --> 19:25.796
under the top sheet and ah,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.298
you can hang your things here.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.534
I'll see you in a second.
Alright thanks.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.990
Is it warm enough in here?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.025
It feels nice.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.701
I start with lite
pressure at first okay,

21:10.703 --> 21:12.603
and you tell me if you
want me to adjust it.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.171
Okay.

21:25.717 --> 21:26.951
Hey.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.053
Hey.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.656
How's it going?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.891
Okay.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.559
How's your day?

21:35.561 --> 21:36.794
Shitty.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.830
Well, why don't you
come over here

21:39.832 --> 21:41.299
and I'll give you a back rub.

21:41.301 --> 21:46.570
Oh. that sounds nice.

21:46.572 --> 21:49.273
Oh, it's tempting. But ah,

21:49.275 --> 21:51.842
I have so much packing to do.

21:54.946 --> 22:02.353
Oh, okay. Um, I'll see
you tomorrow then?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.921
Yeah.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.559
You okay?

22:08.561 --> 22:14.231
Yeah, yeah, I'm
okay. I'm just ah,

22:14.233 --> 22:21.305
I don't know. I'm
just in a funky mood.

22:21.307 --> 22:25.109
I'll call you in
the morning okay?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.011
Call me when you get up.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.547
I will.

22:29.549 --> 22:34.051
I love you.
Me too.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.721
Bye.
Alright. G'night.

22:43.729 --> 22:44.729
E3.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.297
Dad, he's like totally
freaking out.

22:46.299 --> 22:47.832
Mirror.
He loves you.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.433
He says you cured him.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.902
Cured him of what?

22:51.904 --> 22:56.207
Well, he had this horrible
pain. It was in his jaw.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.075
TMJ?
Yeah.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.845
Temporomandibular
Joint disorder.

23:00.847 --> 23:04.749
Right, right. It was so bad
that he had to stop singing.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.952
Since he's left office
and he's had no pain.

23:07.954 --> 23:13.691
My grand-daughter has TMJ.
Maybe you could cure her.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.160
Well, that's doubtful Mrs Olsen.

23:16.162 --> 23:20.398
But if she comes in, I'd
be happy to take a look.

23:20.400 --> 23:25.069
Let's open please. Alright.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.712
Oh... I hate to disappoint
you, but if you came

24:41.714 --> 24:46.016
here hoping that I could somehow
magically take away your pain,

24:46.018 --> 24:48.519
I can't do that.

24:48.521 --> 24:52.356
Okay. I understand.

24:52.358 --> 24:56.527
Do you?
Yes.

24:56.529 --> 25:01.365
Just do whatever you did for
the last guy. The guy you cured.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.268
I, I didn't cure him.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.071
Okay.

25:07.073 --> 25:10.074
Just so long as you understand.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.642
Okay.

25:17.582 --> 25:21.352
Okay, and open, and...

25:59.291 --> 26:00.858
Mr...

26:08.900 --> 26:10.801
What happened?

26:10.803 --> 26:12.870
Word of mouth.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.211
Mr. Harris?

26:35.360 --> 26:39.563
Hi, this is Abby. Due to some
unforeseen circumstances,

26:39.565 --> 26:40.864
I will not be seeing any

26:40.866 --> 26:45.736
clients for the time being. I'm
sorry for any inconvenience that

26:45.738 --> 26:51.909
this causes anybody and ah, I
hope to be back soon. Namaste.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.186
And Abby came running in here,

27:02.188 --> 27:07.424
Grandpa Douglas had just
mixed a batch of this...

27:07.426 --> 27:10.594
and everywhere it
was all over his face.

27:10.596 --> 27:15.299
I was sitting right where you
are and giggling and I mean ...

27:15.301 --> 27:19.637
Oh my gosh, Look
what else came.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.473
Look what you are
doing for people.

27:22.475 --> 27:23.674
I dont', I don't understand it.

27:23.676 --> 27:27.945
It's not like I'm doing
anything differently.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.980
Henry's singing again.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.450
Well, that that's great, but
I'm not responsible for that.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.519
He thinks you are.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.062
Alright.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.901
To my favorite Dentist.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.842
Family dentistry.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.478
I'm going to take the
car out for a bit.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.294
Oh, hey Henry.
Hey Jenny.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.196
Did you come back
to see my dad again?

28:19.198 --> 28:22.132
Um, well, both of you actually.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.269
I um, wanted to give you
tickets to my show.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.038
Oh, oh wow, thank you.

28:28.040 --> 28:32.076
Um, it wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for your dad.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.945
That's incredible. Thanks.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.248
No, it's just a little invite
only thing. It's no big deal.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.118
No, that's cool. We'll
definitely, definitely come.

28:41.120 --> 28:46.390
Cool um, I ah, I
made this for you.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.025
Oh, is this your music?

28:48.027 --> 28:54.565
No, it's just some songs
that I thought you'd like.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.501
Thank you.
You're welcome.

28:57.503 --> 29:03.107
That's so, that's
really sweet. Thanks.

29:03.109 --> 29:07.344
Um, I gotta go, but I, I'm
really looking forward to this.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.145
Cool.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.847
Thank you.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.915
See you there.

29:29.534 --> 29:33.704
Brandon said he's
headed down to Galway.

29:33.706 --> 29:36.840
Craking, Galway,
it's the same thing.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.242
He's really heading
down there...

29:38.244 --> 29:42.479
Hey, Jesse.
Jenny, hey.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.447
Hey.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.350
I'm good. I'm doing good.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.018
Is that the

29:48.020 --> 29:53.223
it's, well it's ah, it's
not a hot pocket.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.360
Wow, that, that is
not a hot pocket.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.996
God, you really
didn't didn't need

29:58.998 --> 30:01.131
I know, but I was, I
was, I was gonna,

30:01.133 --> 30:02.566
you know I was
gonna do it anyway

30:02.568 --> 30:04.802
because I, well, I love to cook

30:04.804 --> 30:08.071
and the conversation
sort of inspired it, so.

30:08.073 --> 30:13.110
God this smells great.
I mean, I feel

30:13.112 --> 30:16.446
No, no don't feel, I
mean it was, it's nothing.

30:16.448 --> 30:21.051
It's totally not
anything you know. Um,

30:21.053 --> 30:25.789
Thank you
I'll see you.

30:25.791 --> 30:32.429
Yeah, um. Hey Jenny,
thanks, this is really nice.

31:06.030 --> 31:11.735
Abby, what?

31:11.737 --> 31:12.669
Will you do me a favor?

31:12.671 --> 31:15.639
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm good.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.708
Will you take your shirt off?

31:30.321 --> 31:31.555
What?

31:36.127 --> 31:39.463
Will you kiss me?

31:39.465 --> 31:42.299
What?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.534
Will you kiss me?

32:00.018 --> 32:02.419
What the fuck?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.654
Abby!

32:24.475 --> 32:29.346
Hey, Reiki. What is Reiki?
That's what Abby's friend does.

32:48.466 --> 32:52.502
And um, how long have
you had this pain?

32:52.504 --> 32:56.406
Oh, for like, ever. That's
what if feels like at least.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.742
Well it started in a
kind of on and off way.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.879
Um, I was still working on the
boat, so it was before 1998.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.614
Right, right.

33:04.616 --> 33:09.152
And um, then it
started to get real bad.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.955
And it's right um,
right in here?

33:11.957 --> 33:13.490
It's both sides.
Both sides.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.725
Both sides hurts.

33:14.727 --> 33:19.763
So that was before 1998 when
it started and then ah...

33:27.972 --> 33:29.172
And after 1998?

33:29.174 --> 33:32.776
Yeah ah, is started
getting really bad,

33:32.778 --> 33:34.144
really persistent all the time.

33:34.146 --> 33:37.748
You know, and um. So that
was like when I got divorced,

33:37.750 --> 33:41.451
so that was back in like 2005.

33:43.622 --> 33:47.524
Thanks for seeing me.
I've heard great things.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.960
Well, let's let's not get
our hopes up too high,

33:49.962 --> 33:52.062
but ah, we'll see
what we can do.

34:30.301 --> 34:36.139
Wow. Okay, what's
going on with you?

34:36.141 --> 34:39.242
I don't, I don't know.

34:39.244 --> 34:43.045
You're energy is, just
completely waperjaw.

34:48.485 --> 34:51.088
I just, I don't know,
I don't know,

34:51.090 --> 34:54.224
I don't know. I just,
I feel really weird.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.260
Everything is weird,
I don't know.

34:57.262 --> 35:04.734
Yeah, I just. I,
I just, I feel off.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.236
Well, you're energy is off.

35:06.238 --> 35:15.679
It's completely all over the
place and incredibly fearful.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.849
I feel like I can't,

35:18.851 --> 35:21.718
I don't know You can't?

35:21.720 --> 35:25.255
With everything I can't.
Like with Jesse I can't.

35:25.257 --> 35:28.058
I don't want him to
touch me, I can't connect.

35:28.060 --> 35:32.362
I don't know how to, I don't
know, is there something?

35:32.364 --> 35:35.799
Yeah. Too much here.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.236
When's the last time you guys
just went out and you know...

35:39.238 --> 35:44.774
when's the last time you
went dancing? Hiking?

35:44.776 --> 35:52.215
I don't know. I can't I just.
I need you to fix me please.

35:52.217 --> 35:53.617
You can fix yourself.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.418
I can't.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.387
Maybe you need
physiological trigger.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.590
Have you ever tried MDMA?

36:00.592 --> 36:07.197
Oh yeah. It's like a big deal in
certain psychotherapy circles.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.732
Are you fucking
with me right now?

36:08.734 --> 36:11.334
No. Charlie and I tried it.

36:11.336 --> 36:16.139
We did it. It was a
great way for us to...

36:16.141 --> 36:20.277
reconnect. What?

36:20.279 --> 36:26.016
I, I just don't know
where I would even get it.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.084
Hold on.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.092
Wow.

36:41.599 --> 36:47.370
I haven't looked there
since... anyway.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.373
One for you, one for Jesse.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.176
Think of it as a hall pass.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.711
Permission slip to just let

36:54.713 --> 36:58.248
go of your fear and
embrace the world.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.122
Or not.

37:25.810 --> 37:29.246
Oh my God! I'm such a jerk,
I'm so sorry, I am so late.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.780
Ah, that looks amazing.

37:30.782 --> 37:34.718
Oh Bronwen had a cancellation
and I just tried to sneak in

37:34.720 --> 37:36.019
and it just went way over.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.256
Um, but I think she
had a really great idea.

37:39.258 --> 37:43.093
What's that?
Look what she gave me.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.295
What is that?

37:45.297 --> 37:48.765
Ecstasy.

37:48.767 --> 37:55.171
Ecstasy? A-awesome.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.941
Yeah, I know! I thought it could
be really good for us right now.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.111
Um, I kind of want to do it
before Paul and Jenny gets here,

38:01.113 --> 38:02.979
but we should probably
wait to do it til they leave.

38:02.981 --> 38:06.049
Probably.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.384
What's wrong.

38:07.386 --> 38:12.022
Nothing um, ecstasy huh?

38:12.024 --> 38:13.923
What do you think?

38:13.925 --> 38:17.661
Abby, I think you're acting a
little bit nuts is what I think.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.762
Why?

38:18.764 --> 38:20.163
We haven't even had a
chance to talk about

38:20.165 --> 38:21.364
what happened yesterday
at the shop.

38:21.366 --> 38:25.335
Yeah, I know I just
I Wh-what was that?

38:25.337 --> 38:27.937
You come in then you take off
and then you just leave?

38:27.939 --> 38:28.738
Yeah.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.908
Imagine how that made me feel.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.911
taking drugs right now
is what we need to do?

38:34.913 --> 38:36.546
I mean, I think that's the last
thing that we need to do.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.014
I think we need to stop and and

38:38.016 --> 38:40.617
and get real with each
other for a second.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.018
I'm being real with you.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.354
Abby, you're an hour and
a half late for a dinner

38:44.356 --> 38:47.023
that I've been cooking for your
family, which is totally fine

38:47.025 --> 38:50.727
But then you waltz in here with
drugs in your hand and and..

38:50.729 --> 38:54.197
I'm sorry it may be me, but
it feels a little bit weird.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.633
I don't know, I just
thought it would be...

38:56.635 --> 38:58.134
What, you need to
take some sort of,

38:58.136 --> 39:01.371
you know, drugs,
to be with me?

39:01.373 --> 39:04.774
No, no, God, no. I just
thought it would be fun

39:04.776 --> 39:06.576
I'm just saying like,

39:06.578 --> 39:09.212
you're just acting a
little bit different.

39:09.214 --> 39:10.347
I know.

39:10.349 --> 39:13.049
And is there something
going on with you? I mean?

39:13.051 --> 39:18.054
Yeah. I just wanted to do
something that might be fun.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.522
I don't know.
It was stupid.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.624
So stupid, it was
stupid. Stupid idea..

39:21.626 --> 39:26.529
No it's not stupid. I just
caught me off guard and and..

39:26.531 --> 39:29.065
okay, they're here.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.735
You know, just forget I
said anything about it.

39:31.737 --> 39:32.669
It's stupid.

39:32.671 --> 39:41.077
No, it it's... ecstasy.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.748
Hey guys. Yay salad,
thank you, Come on in.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.317
Here's some wine.
Thanks

39:48.919 --> 39:51.755
You guys find a seat.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.456
It's kind of
incredible actually.

39:53.458 --> 39:57.026
I mean, you're like
changing lives.

39:57.028 --> 40:01.030
Yeah you are. Yeah,
Henry, he's gonna,

40:01.032 --> 40:04.367
he hasn't performed
in like two years.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.569
I mean that's because of you.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.873
You should feel really
really good about that.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.609
That's great Paul.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.676
Yeah.

40:16.947 --> 40:20.817
Jesse's organizing a 30mile
urban bike race downtown.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.819
Oh, c'mon.
You are.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.922
It's a bike ride, bike ride.
It's not a race.

40:25.924 --> 40:26.990
I thought it was like a race.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.825
No, it's like a group ride.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.860
Oh group ride.
Yeah.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.162
That sounds really
cool actually.

40:32.164 --> 40:34.264
And what's the point?

40:39.637 --> 40:40.703
Fun.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.544
Can you pass your plate please?

40:47.546 --> 40:49.646
That was really really good.
Thank you.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.182
It was really delicious.
Thank you.

40:55.786 --> 40:59.088
How is it being
roomies you guys?

40:59.090 --> 41:03.993
Um, I'll let you know when
I, when I finish packing.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.361
Someone's being lazy.

41:05.363 --> 41:05.962
Yeah.

41:05.964 --> 41:06.963
You're not moving in?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.466
I am moving in.

41:09.468 --> 41:14.270
This weekend we're gonna
tackle it. Just been busy.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.841
Oh Paul, I got you that
elixir from Bronwen.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.076
She said she wanted
to see you in person,

41:20.078 --> 41:23.713
but I told her that was
probably never gonna happen.

41:23.715 --> 41:24.814
Why'd you say that?

41:24.816 --> 41:27.484
Because you said
you'd, I don't know.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.688
Here. Her tonic.
Knock yourself out.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.761
What are these?

41:42.466 --> 41:45.068
Ecstasy.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.771
What? Are you taking that?

41:48.773 --> 41:50.707
Ah, yeah.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.909
Why are you taking ecstasy?

41:52.911 --> 41:54.878
It's a hug drug Paul.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.181
I'm addicted. I'm actually
a fucking drug addict,

41:58.183 --> 42:03.386
I wanted to tell you about it.
Who wants dessert?

42:03.388 --> 42:04.621
Cheesy pudding.

42:10.060 --> 42:14.397
That tofu was so, I don't
usually like tofu and I just...

42:14.399 --> 42:20.036
Oh thanks. I cooked it in like
really special olive oil. So.

42:28.579 --> 42:34.017
Welcome.
Thank you.

42:34.019 --> 42:38.555
So did you have a particular
goal in mind for today?

42:38.557 --> 42:42.425
Um, no. Just, I'm curious.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.960
Okay.

42:43.962 --> 42:51.701
You know Abby, my sister,
she, said that it's amazing.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.938
I think it is. I think
you're going really enjoy it.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.306
So why don't we just
get started into

42:56.308 --> 42:58.007
the session and see
where it takes us.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.209
Okay.
Okay.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.345
I'll take your coat for you.

43:04.348 --> 43:06.316
How's the temperature
feel in here? Okay?

43:06.318 --> 43:07.383
In here?
Yeah.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.685
Um, it's good.

43:14.291 --> 43:19.329
Oh. You don't need to remove
your clothes for Reiki.

43:19.331 --> 43:20.663
I'm sorry.

43:20.665 --> 43:22.098
No, it's fine.
Sorry. No.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.766
No, you know what you're
actually if you would,

43:23.768 --> 43:24.667
if you are more comfortable

43:24.669 --> 43:26.703
I'd love you to remove
your clothes.

43:26.705 --> 43:30.006
I mean if you want to,
if you feel comfortable.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.541
No.

43:31.543 --> 43:34.210
Okay, so if you want
to just climb up here

43:34.212 --> 43:38.448
and get comfortable
with your head this way.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.754
Oh, wow, okay.

43:44.756 --> 43:47.323
That's the most interesting
way anyone's ever gotten

43:47.325 --> 43:50.126
on my Reiki table before.

43:50.128 --> 43:50.960
Okay. Just put my head up there.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.195
Yes.

43:53.397 --> 43:54.964
Okay.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.105
I, that looks actually
really comfortable,

44:02.107 --> 44:03.339
but I should have
been more specific.

44:03.341 --> 44:04.941
I meant on your, if
you can get on your

44:04.943 --> 44:06.342
back with your head up here.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.977
Oh, okay.
Perfect.

44:07.979 --> 44:08.678
Like that?
Yes.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.913
Okay. Is that good?

44:10.915 --> 44:12.682
That's perfect. Just lie,
if you let your feet,

44:12.684 --> 44:14.751
your legs lie flat
on the table.

44:14.753 --> 44:16.986
Yeah. Just to completely
let your legs fall

44:16.988 --> 44:19.122
where they, let your feet fall

44:19.124 --> 44:20.556
Like that.
Just absolutely relax.

44:20.558 --> 44:24.927
Let every muscle just
relax. Your hands.

44:24.929 --> 44:25.828
Okay.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.830
Just resting comfortably
at your side.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.532
Alright Yeah, just
get comfortable

44:29.534 --> 44:33.369
Alright.
Everything's fine, this is good.

44:33.371 --> 44:37.874
Maybe you should picture
yourself someplace

44:37.876 --> 44:40.376
where you feel the
most comfortable.

44:40.378 --> 44:43.212
The place where you feel safe,

44:43.214 --> 44:47.750
the place where you feel
happy. You picture that.

44:47.752 --> 44:50.520
The office, like at my office.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.522
Your office?

44:52.524 --> 44:56.426
Um, maybe we should
try to get out

44:56.428 --> 44:59.996
of the office and
go to the beach

44:59.998 --> 45:03.599
and sit on the sand and feel
the warm sun on your skin.

45:03.601 --> 45:07.103
I'd rather, I'd rather
be at the office.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.404
Okay, great.

45:08.406 --> 45:12.308
So is there a favorite chair in
your office? Or a favorite...

45:12.310 --> 45:14.944
I like the back
room The back room

45:14.946 --> 45:16.045
where I look at x-ray's

45:16.047 --> 45:17.346
where you look at x-ray's, okay.

45:17.348 --> 45:23.386
Well, you look at x-rays in your
back room and I will do Reiki.

45:23.388 --> 45:28.324
Okay. Just get in your back
room and close your eyes.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.534
Are you're eyes closed?

45:38.536 --> 45:39.769
Yep.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.681
Huh. Okay. Wow.

45:51.683 --> 45:53.049
Are you alright?

45:53.051 --> 45:54.117
That was, that was great.

45:54.119 --> 45:58.488
Uh-hum. Nah. I just want to
know um, what it's about.

45:58.490 --> 46:02.058
Yeah. Like how you're
doing, what are you?

46:02.060 --> 46:03.092
How are you doing it?

46:03.094 --> 46:07.363
How, how how are you
doing it? What are you

46:07.365 --> 46:10.767
Well, do you want to
learn how to do Reiki?

46:10.769 --> 46:12.835
Yes.

46:12.837 --> 46:15.438
Because I can, I mean, I can
show you how. I can teach you.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.706
Great. Great.

46:16.708 --> 46:21.344
I can, but it is energy work,
you know that don't you.

46:21.346 --> 46:23.045
Are you aware that
it's energy work.

46:23.047 --> 46:25.181
Energy.

46:25.183 --> 46:27.283
And I channel energy into you

46:27.285 --> 46:30.386
to help you balance
your energy and.

46:30.388 --> 46:32.221
You know what, why
don't we just for today,

46:32.223 --> 46:34.423
why don't I work on you and
you can feel what it feels like

46:34.425 --> 46:36.492
and then we can
meet another time

46:36.494 --> 46:41.397
and I can explain
everything to do with Reiki.

46:41.399 --> 46:45.601
You could even be a Reiki
master if you wanted to be.

46:45.603 --> 46:47.170
Is that what you want.

46:48.906 --> 46:52.175
You could be a Reiki master!

46:52.177 --> 46:53.109
How's that sound?

46:53.111 --> 46:54.443
It sounds good.

46:54.445 --> 46:57.180
Okay. So, get back
in your office.

46:57.182 --> 46:59.415
Okay. Alright.

46:59.417 --> 47:02.518
Okay. Oh, good.
Scooch down a little bit.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.386
Okay.
That's perfect.

47:03.388 --> 47:04.720
Is that good?
Yes.

47:04.722 --> 47:05.755
Alright. Okay? Ready?
Here we go.

47:05.757 --> 47:07.757
Okay.
Let's go.

47:17.601 --> 47:22.405
Pop your legs up on the
couch. Just cross them over.

47:22.407 --> 47:25.041
Can you get that up there?

47:25.043 --> 47:32.148
Stay still, stay still. Just
don't let go. Don't let go.

47:32.150 --> 47:37.620
Just relax down a little bit.

47:37.622 --> 47:39.188
Good, see, you're
okay, I've got you.

47:39.190 --> 47:42.825
You're, you're
safe. You're okay.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.329
You know what? Put your
legs down on the floor.

47:46.331 --> 47:47.964
Just put them down on
the floor, that's better.

47:47.966 --> 47:49.498
And onto the next position,

47:49.500 --> 47:53.236
just put them over the
heart, above the breast.

47:58.809 --> 48:05.314
Okay, move down onto the lower
abdomen, yeah, right down there.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.932
So what we're gonna do
Dillon, in the first step is

48:22.934 --> 48:26.068
we're just going to
put some articulate...

48:26.070 --> 48:28.137
Are you ready?

48:32.109 --> 48:33.342
Alright.

48:34.544 --> 48:37.780
One, two, three...

48:39.316 --> 48:41.517
How's that feel?

48:41.519 --> 48:43.586
Can you...Better?

48:47.291 --> 48:49.525
I think it is.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.870
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

49:02.906 --> 49:05.408
Thank you
Oh you're welcome.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.443
Thank you.
You're welcome.

49:33.303 --> 49:37.740
I felt something.
Did you feel something?

51:07.931 --> 51:10.166
Come on in.

51:35.625 --> 51:37.193
See how that is.

51:39.563 --> 51:41.130
Good.

51:44.034 --> 51:46.268
Looks good.

51:46.470 --> 51:48.037
Thank you.

51:51.875 --> 51:54.777
I went to Bronwen.

51:54.779 --> 51:55.878
What do you mean?

51:55.880 --> 51:57.680
I, I went.

51:57.682 --> 52:00.516
You did?
Mm-mm.

52:00.518 --> 52:06.355
Did you like it?
Yes.

52:06.357 --> 52:09.892
I'm impressed.
Thank you.

52:09.894 --> 52:12.428
And how, how are you?

52:12.430 --> 52:15.498
Been better.

52:17.300 --> 52:23.939
And um, with the
um, ecstasy, is that?

52:23.941 --> 52:26.408
Please don't start in.
No, I

52:28.645 --> 52:30.179
I have never taken it.

52:30.181 --> 52:33.115
But, you had, had it in
your purse. Why did you...

52:33.117 --> 52:38.287
I just thought I could
make some things better

52:38.289 --> 52:40.890
With Jess, you and Jesse?

52:40.892 --> 52:42.224
I don't know, it's
supposed to help you

52:42.226 --> 52:48.531
open up and help
you connect, and.

52:48.533 --> 52:52.801
But, not to be. Don't worry,
your sister isn't a drug addict.

52:52.803 --> 52:54.637
Okay. You have to be careful.

52:54.639 --> 52:56.205
I know.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.712
How does Jenny seem?

53:03.714 --> 53:05.814
Fine.

53:05.816 --> 53:08.651
Really?
Mm-mm.

53:08.653 --> 53:10.252
I don't think she's fine.

53:10.254 --> 53:12.154
What do you mean?

53:14.124 --> 53:16.692
I think you need to
let her go Paul.

53:19.796 --> 53:22.831
I'm not, I'm not holding
her hostage or anything.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.067
I just think she wants to
be doing other things.

53:25.069 --> 53:29.572
I think she wants, I think
she wants to go to school.

53:29.574 --> 53:32.074
In fact, I know she
wants to go to school.

53:32.076 --> 53:35.511
She has never said anything
to me about school. I know..

53:35.513 --> 53:36.845
Because she thinks
you don't want her to go.

53:36.847 --> 53:39.248
She thinks you want her.
Never even...

53:39.250 --> 53:41.250
Never even discussed...

53:41.252 --> 53:42.351
Yeah, I know you
never discussed...

53:42.353 --> 53:44.119
Where do you come up
with this? You're like

53:44.121 --> 53:45.321
I come up with it from her.

53:45.323 --> 53:47.590
She filled out all her
college applications

53:47.592 --> 53:48.657
and she won't send them in

53:48.659 --> 53:50.025
because she thinks you're
going to be crushed.

53:50.027 --> 53:56.298
Yeah. Okay. You're a piece
of work. You know that?

53:56.300 --> 53:58.867
Yeah? How am I, how
am I a piece of work?

53:58.869 --> 54:03.138
Um, okay. Well you
come into my house and...

54:03.140 --> 54:04.673
I come into your house?
What do you mean?

54:04.675 --> 54:06.208
It's our house. It's
our parents house.

54:06.210 --> 54:09.745
Our house, our house,
but it's the house

54:09.747 --> 54:12.081
The house that I've
been maintaining.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.783
That I've been paying property
taxes on since mom died.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.285
That's the house.
Okay fine that's your house,

54:16.287 --> 54:18.153
your house your house
That house that I've...

54:18.155 --> 54:19.855
mm-mm.

54:19.857 --> 54:22.958
And then, so you
come in and then you

54:22.960 --> 54:25.961
and then you accuse me of
holding my daughter hostage.

54:25.963 --> 54:30.132
Okay, as opposed to like,
letting her live here rent free.

54:30.134 --> 54:33.235
Providing her with
gainful employment.

54:33.237 --> 54:35.070
Teaching her,
teaching her a skill.

54:35.072 --> 54:39.942
Yeah, in a field she
has zero interest in.

54:39.944 --> 54:46.282
Just ask her.
Ask her if she's happy.

54:46.284 --> 54:49.585
I don't know. I'm
going to put this away.

55:43.473 --> 55:45.507
Hey in here?
Scaller?

55:45.509 --> 55:48.243
Hello can you hear? I want
my money back please.

55:48.245 --> 55:51.714
This guy is a God-damn fraud.

55:51.716 --> 55:55.117
Fucking TMJ's back.

55:55.119 --> 55:57.553

56:07.064 --> 56:11.900
Hello! Doctor. Oh there you are.
You did not cure my TMJ.

56:14.371 --> 56:18.340
I, I never I never promised.

56:18.342 --> 56:20.075
You didn't promise?
I paid you money.

56:20.077 --> 56:21.543
I'd like my money back please.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.046
Not only is my TMJ raging,

56:24.048 --> 56:26.382
but I left here with the
worst headache of my life.

56:26.384 --> 56:29.084
And I still have it. You
know it's getting worse.

56:29.086 --> 56:31.120
Maybe if you could calm down
and stop yelling at everybody.

56:31.122 --> 56:34.323
Oh screw you!
Okay that's, that's that...

56:34.325 --> 56:37.726

I don't drink like that
anymore, you know. I ah,

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:16.544
I've been sober for probably
about a year and a half. Um,

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.046
Good for you.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:19.614

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:35.063
Thanks.

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:39.868
You guys still over
on Columbia St?

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:44.773
Ah, no. That's long back.
My, my grandma passed away.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.275
Awe
Yeah.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:50.178
I'm just back kind a
taking care of things.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.180
Get the house ready to sell.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:57.018
Yeah. I remember that house.

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.232
You want to see it?

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.146
Jenny?

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.155
Jenny.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.482
Jenny?

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:12.494
It's Dad. Ah, call me um, okay.
Bye.

01:08:54.095 --> 01:09:02.670
I remember. The light.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:06.006
The light in this room.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:08.076
It felt like

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.948
morning but it wasn't.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:22.991
I remember your bed
on the floor with...

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:25.225
just a box spring.

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:33.600
I remember UB-40
on the turntable.

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:40.774
"You Shoot Me Down With Flames."

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.814
I remember

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:59.494
you asking me if I trusted you.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.868
I remember you opened your
button fly's with one "foop"

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:11.306
and I almost started
cracking up.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:23.117
I remember, I
remember our bodies,

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:36.297
like one thing, like
one complete thing.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:49.744
I remember feeling like
maybe I didn't have a body.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:59.320
Did it hurt?

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.524
I don't know.

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:11.933
That part I don't remember.

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:24.612
Was I your first heartbreak?

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:25.847
Yeah.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:42.997
I think I knew I was gonna
be even as I was doing it.

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:46.534
I'm sorry. I'm really
sorry for that.

01:11:53.676 --> 01:12:03.785
It's okay.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.507
Hey.
Hi.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.076
Uh, Abby's not here.

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.578
I know, I know.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.013
Um, you want to come in?

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:36.584
Do you, do you want to go
maybe see some music with me?

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:43.358
Um, right now?
Yeah.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:51.199
Um, yeah. Yeah sure. Um,
let me just grab a jacket.

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:52.433
Okay.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:38.312

Like five or six years.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.824
Is that when you first got
into like, like all the biking?

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:50.031
Yeah. It was just so
much different then,

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:52.233
just a different vibe.

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:55.569
It was more my anarchist stage.

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:56.771
Anarchist cycling?

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:59.173
Yeah.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.676
I was just one angry dude.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.347
That's hard to imagine.

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:07.581
Is it?

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:17.892
Yeah. You're just,
you're so um...

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:19.460
So what?

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:30.905
Have you ever

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:33.974
wanted to kiss
someone so badly

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:36.544
that it hurts your skin?

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.920
Ah, Jenny.

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:52.793
I don't know what to say.

01:18:52.795 --> 01:18:57.364
You don't, you don't
have to say anything.

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:08.609
Maybe you, maybe you
could just kiss me.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:15.349
It wouldn't, it wouldn't
have to mean anything.

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:21.856
Jenny, that's a terrible idea.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:31.198
I, I know. I know,
I Look I'm sorry.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.737
I mean, you know
I love Abby right?

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:44.411
I, I know, I know, I know.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.280
Are you okay?

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.551
Yeah.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.686
Are you sure?

01:19:56.057 --> 01:20:06.300
Maybe could you
just, just hold me?

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:11.138
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:48.329
