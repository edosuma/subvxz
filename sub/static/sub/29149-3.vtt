00:08.554 --> 00:10.445
I thought that it was
something that we wanted

00:10.446 --> 00:11.735
for me, to have it.

00:11.736 --> 00:13.547

SHIV ROY: Think that's

Is it wise to fire the board?

You tried to kill me, but you failed.

just shutter the fucker.

Absolutely. You were very
clear about your concerns.

you would be a big step.

some wisdom to impart.

02:22.606 --> 02:26.275
Look, Greg, if you want
this to be anonymous,

02:26.276 --> 02:28.025
you have to say that from the outset.

02:28.026 --> 02:29.735
You can't do that retroactively.

Do you want to present your side,

21:18.236 --> 21:19.735
Yeah.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.235
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to speak at the wedding, but...

21:22.236 --> 21:24.315
You must have cut me dead four times.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.405
Ah, busy, busy, busy.

21:26.406 --> 21:29.856
- Kendall, the thing. Oh.
- Yeah, here it is.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.815
Frank.

21:32.816 --> 21:34.236
- For you.
- What's this?

21:36.526 --> 21:38.065
The back, the back.

That's nice. It's a nice thing.

21:59.156 --> 22:00.815
You okay?

22:00.816 --> 22:03.945
Sandy and Stewy have
got my nuts in a vice.

22:03.946 --> 22:08.105
But Frank, you've got the
grease to slip them out.

22:08.106 --> 22:12.235
- Right?
- Truly revolting image.

22:12.236 --> 22:15.105
- Hey, Kenny.
- Good to see you, Frank.

22:15.106 --> 22:17.105

22:17.106 --> 22:19.445
It's not been the same without you.

22:19.446 --> 22:21.695
It's been better.

22:21.696 --> 22:24.485
- I'm fucking with you.
- Okay.

22:24.486 --> 22:26.486
I'm... I'm kidding, sir.

- Our safety briefing.
- Safety briefing?

22:34.106 --> 22:36.355
Here's the safety briefing:

22:36.356 --> 22:38.605
If you move against me,

22:38.606 --> 22:41.446

Okay, thank you. Hey,

- Wow, Eric.

Hey, Connor...

23:19.196 --> 23:23.485
Those are serious guys.
They're fuckin' pieces of shit.

Yep. They're my pieces of shit.

23:29.406 --> 23:31.195
- Uh, no. I'm good. Thanks.
- CONNOR: Okay.

23:34.236 --> 23:36.355
Burgundy.

23:36.356 --> 23:39.355
- I'm sorry?
- I hyper-decant.

23:39.356 --> 23:41.155
You don't hyper-decant?

23:41.156 --> 23:42.815
You're just doing regular decanting?

23:42.816 --> 23:44.025
If by regular decanting you mean

23:44.026 --> 23:45.905
pouring into my open mouth, yeah.

23:45.906 --> 23:47.905
You should hyper-decant.

23:47.906 --> 23:50.155
It softens the tannins.
Heightens the aromas.

23:50.156 --> 23:53.405
You can age your wine
five years in ten seconds.

23:53.406 --> 23:54.406
Truly.

23:55.856 --> 23:57.655
- Mm-hmm.
- Connor...

23:57.656 --> 23:59.905
You know what they do
to rich people in jail.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.565
Yes, they let them out early

24:01.566 --> 24:04.065
to mitigate the risk of litigation.

24:04.066 --> 24:06.655
Going to jail is not a good look.

24:06.656 --> 24:09.195
Not many campaign posters use mugshots.

24:09.196 --> 24:10.405
The world has changed, Shiv.

The old shibboleths are crumbling.

24:12.406 --> 24:14.406
And you know what?
The elites are scared.

24:15.816 --> 24:17.735
I can see 'em down there,

24:17.736 --> 24:20.985
a-scrabbling and reconfiguring,

24:20.986 --> 24:25.905
with no clue what the whirlwind
they have stirred heralds.

24:25.906 --> 24:28.355
Do you think that maybe
if you're looking down

24:28.356 --> 24:30.695
on the elites from, like,
you know, this penthouse,

24:30.696 --> 24:32.156
maybe it's indicative of something?

24:33.486 --> 24:34.855
Smart.

24:34.856 --> 24:37.065
My baby sister is smart, right?

24:37.066 --> 24:39.405
- She is. Hey.
- SHIV: Hi.

24:39.406 --> 24:42.235
- How are you?
- Uh, yeah. Connor,

24:42.236 --> 24:44.775
don't release the video. Okay? Please?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.525
(SIGHS) Why?

24:47.526 --> 24:50.485
The family. We're worried
you're gonna humiliate us,

24:50.486 --> 24:52.445
and humiliate yourself.

24:52.446 --> 24:54.605
- CONNOR: Oh, okay. Dad?
- Yeah.

24:54.606 --> 24:56.315
Dad wants to stop me.

24:56.316 --> 24:59.735
Well, tell him to get in line
behind Bezos and the Clintons.

24:59.736 --> 25:02.405
Connor, I'm asking a favor.

25:02.406 --> 25:03.655
Please.

25:03.656 --> 25:07.065
Well, how about I make counter-offer?

25:07.066 --> 25:10.605
I'd like to make a
rather indecent proposal.

25:10.606 --> 25:13.315
I'm g... (CHUCKLES) guessing
you haven't seen that film.

25:13.316 --> 25:15.315
Ooh. He has. Yeah, it's his favorite.

25:15.316 --> 25:17.696
I happen to know you're at a loose end.

25:18.816 --> 25:20.316
Shiv, come and work for me.

25:21.026 --> 25:23.485
Hmm? What? No.

25:23.486 --> 25:25.315
(LAUGHS) No. No.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.195
It's a big offer. Big.

25:27.196 --> 25:29.485
Big offer, Shiv. You'd
run the whole shebang.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.815
And look, if Gil fired
you, maybe you're, um,

25:31.816 --> 25:33.945
- a difficult hire right now.
- He didn't fire me.

25:33.946 --> 25:35.605
- I walked out.
- Okay.

25:35.606 --> 25:37.155
- I... I...
- No. Okay.

25:37.156 --> 25:39.735
So what would it take for
you to change your mind?

25:39.736 --> 25:41.275
- A lobotomy.

of modern politics.

25:44.856 --> 25:47.356

25:49.906 --> 25:50.986
Okay.

25:52.816 --> 25:55.695
I will consider with my team.

just a bunch of actors,

- What?

26:25.276 --> 26:26.695
You wanna come?

26:26.696 --> 26:28.315

what you did in Cruises?

What we did? No. No. Uh...

27:28.406 --> 27:30.945
No. I was gonna ask
you about this Sam guy.

- Do you know him?
- Rat-fucker Sam? Yeah, sure.

27:33.446 --> 27:35.105

Wow. Yeah. So, what's
his... (STAMMERS) Is he...

27:43.106 --> 27:44.605
Is he... Is he nice?

about the moral character

- So...

28:11.816 --> 28:13.315
I'm wondering how likely it is

28:13.316 --> 28:16.655
that Sam will find
out the person emailed

28:16.656 --> 28:21.025
- from a private email.
- Oh, fuck, man. Really?

28:21.026 --> 28:24.155

I didn't... I pre-met her.

28:35.106 --> 28:36.565
he might kill you.

- Mm.
- Okay,

28:37.986 --> 28:40.105
so you need to put
that in the locker, man,

28:40.106 --> 28:42.105
and don't tell anyone.

28:42.106 --> 28:43.695

53:47.566 --> 53:49.196
It was Mo.

53:50.486 --> 53:51.855
Piece of shit!

53:51.856 --> 53:55.566
I also talked to Maria.
Mo passed away last night.

53:58.276 --> 53:59.356
What?

54:02.026 --> 54:03.196
Mo now?

54:05.696 --> 54:06.696
Jesus.

54:07.696 --> 54:08.696
Uh...

54:09.856 --> 54:12.696
Give Maria my, um...

54:14.356 --> 54:17.525
uh, condolences. I...

54:17.526 --> 54:22.655
I... In fact, send Sam
over. Let's crack his email.

54:22.656 --> 54:25.236
I want to know what the
fuck he's been saying.

54:28.946 --> 54:30.026
Mo, hmm.

54:32.446 --> 54:34.905
- (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, Greg.
- Hey, Tom.

54:34.906 --> 54:37.856
(LOGAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

54:41.946 --> 54:43.066
(WHISPERING) Thanks, man.

54:49.736 --> 54:53.155
ROMAN: No... Uh, thank
you. I can do that. Thanks.

54:53.156 --> 54:55.065

54:55.066 --> 54:57.735

54:57.736 --> 55:00.696

- So, hurry up.

55:01.736 --> 55:05.565
So Frank's my fucking babysitter again.

55:05.566 --> 55:07.605

55:07.606 --> 55:12.775

cutting my fucking balls off.

55:12.776 --> 55:14.106
I can't do my buttons.

Come here.

55:24.356 --> 55:26.445
You know, if I were capable
of any sudden movement,

55:26.446 --> 55:28.816
I would totally pounce on you right now.

55:29.816 --> 55:32.065
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

55:32.066 --> 55:33.525
I actually hear that a lot.

55:33.526 --> 55:35.695
Usually from men in their nineties.

55:35.696 --> 55:37.946
You have to do that one. (CLEARS THROAT)

55:38.856 --> 55:40.406

55:41.856 --> 55:42.946

55:49.696 --> 55:51.945

55:51.946 --> 55:53.695
It was her idea.

55:53.696 --> 55:55.735
Next time you need business advice,

55:55.736 --> 55:58.106
ask someone who knows
what they're talking about.

55:59.236 --> 56:02.235
- What, you?
- Yeah. Like me.

56:02.236 --> 56:06.655
Okay. Well, how do I get
him to take me seriously?

56:06.656 --> 56:08.855
Grow a moustache and read the Journal?

56:08.856 --> 56:09.986
I'll fuckin' do it.

56:12.156 --> 56:14.195
Okay, Roman, if you wanna know...

56:14.196 --> 56:15.279
Mm-hmm.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.735
...do the management training
program, ground floor.

56:18.736 --> 56:20.445
Work at a slaughterhouse.

56:20.446 --> 56:23.315
Learn the price of a gallon of milk.

56:23.316 --> 56:26.155
What the fuck is his
obsession with milk?

Kittens and perverts.

56:33.356 --> 56:36.025
Pierce's CEO, Rhea Jarrell,

56:36.026 --> 56:38.735
emailed saying she heard
about your approach.

56:38.736 --> 56:40.445
She can help us.

56:40.446 --> 56:44.405
So... can you bring me
her head on a platter?

56:44.406 --> 56:45.775
I can bring you her head

56:45.776 --> 56:47.405
attached to the rest of her body.

56:47.406 --> 56:48.605
Good.

57:15.406 --> 57:18.525
- pretty tough... actually, yeah.
- Yeah?

57:18.526 --> 57:19.735
Anybody fill you in?

57:19.736 --> 57:22.775
Uh, no. Wh... What happened?

57:22.776 --> 57:27.856
Um, your dad was a little peppery.

57:28.856 --> 57:31.605
Oh. I'm sorry, Tom.

57:31.606 --> 57:35.775
Maybe it wasn't totally
great what you sent me to do.

57:35.776 --> 57:39.405
Which is kind of the opposite
of what I wanted to do.

57:39.406 --> 57:41.605
Uh-huh. Yeah.

57:41.606 --> 57:43.105
I mean...

57:43.106 --> 57:46.735
- we're a team, right?
- Yeah.

57:46.736 --> 57:48.905
But I... I don't wanna be a dick,

57:48.906 --> 57:51.735
but maybe I should have a bit more input

57:51.736 --> 57:53.106
into team tactics.

57:54.696 --> 57:56.316
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

Yeah. Okay.
