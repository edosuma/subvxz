WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:07.508
(horn blows)

00:08.909 --> 00:11.177
(crowd murmuring)

00:12.478 --> 00:14.380
(door opens)

00:16.583 --> 00:18.351
(door closes)

00:28.394 --> 00:29.930
You're number 218?

00:30.797 --> 00:33.634
Yes. I thought
I was meeting Freddy.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.736
Well, Freddy works for me,
but I gave him the day off.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.770
I'm Sid Herman.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.040
Jimmy.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.578
Well,
my condolences, Jimmy.

00:45.311 --> 00:46.479
(sighs)

00:46.513 --> 00:48.114
What the Steelers did to you
ought to be against the law --

00:48.148 --> 00:51.852
Cruel and unusual punishment.
You see the game?

00:52.986 --> 00:54.287
Of course, you saw it.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.556
(sighs)

00:55.589 --> 00:58.291
$5,000 wager -- you got a pulse,
you're going to watch the game.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.260
That interception
killed me.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.862
That's why I don't bet.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.765
I have a good portion
of the money.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.366
See, I would've gone
with the Steelers, too.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.902
What, are you kidding --
getting 8 1/2?

01:08.935 --> 01:11.471
But now,
oh, with the Steelers

01:11.505 --> 01:14.608
and, uh,
losers on the Falcons

01:14.641 --> 01:18.111
and the Rams and the Bears
and the Niners,

01:18.144 --> 01:20.714
plus, what you didn't get
to Freddy last week...

01:20.747 --> 01:22.716
I have $7,000.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.886
Which means you owe,
what, 27 more?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.821
Which I will have
by the end of the week.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.357
You're two weeks late now.

01:31.391 --> 01:34.094
I'm going to borrow some money
from my retirement account,

01:34.127 --> 01:35.529
but it takes a couple of days,

01:35.562 --> 01:38.398
and I got a call in to
a cousin of mine in Worcester.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.600
Guy owns, like,
12 parking lots --

01:39.633 --> 01:41.134
I got another idea.

01:43.236 --> 01:46.640
Okay...sure.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.474
You're a lawyer, right?

01:49.409 --> 01:53.880
Yes, I mean...
Did I tell Freddy that?

01:53.914 --> 01:56.617
My proposal is this --
you provide some legal services

01:56.650 --> 02:00.521
and your debt goes away.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.291
Well, what sort of, uh,
legal services?

02:07.260 --> 02:09.162
My ex-wife is trying
to rob me.

02:11.164 --> 02:13.667
Will you be my lawyer,
Jimmy?

02:17.871 --> 02:20.607
(music playing)

03:06.019 --> 03:07.854
It's decaf, Lucy.
It's not.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.123
I can tell when it's decaf.
It's regular.

03:10.156 --> 03:13.126
You know, I find on trial days
I don't need caffeine.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.661
Listen to you, the office
coffee hog, telling me --

03:14.695 --> 03:15.929
What?

03:15.962 --> 03:17.964
You might as well hook up
an I. V., Rebecca.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.966
I take my share,
no more.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.102
Lindsay, that was
Martin Jenks' mother.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.137
She's still in Hartford.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.106
Wait. Excuse me?

03:26.139 --> 03:27.741
She couldn't get
the day off.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.042
Her son goes on trial
for attempted murder.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.276
She can't get the day off?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.344
I thought
you were going to plead.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.278
He wouldn't let me.

03:32.312 --> 03:35.015
Don't tell me --
he's innocent.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.316
He is.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.687
(door opens)

03:40.721 --> 03:41.454
Morning.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.023
Still morning?

03:43.056 --> 03:46.392
Sorry I'm late. That, uh,
personal matter of mine

03:46.426 --> 03:48.494
went a little longer
than I thought.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.032
Bobby, you got a minute?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.166
Sure.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.471
What's up?

04:00.273 --> 04:03.443
Deposition in the Sandler case
got pushed.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.412
They're saying
beginning of next month.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.751
That's what you need
a minute for?

04:12.018 --> 04:15.421
Bobby, I was asked to do
some pro bono work

04:15.455 --> 04:18.224
which I really need to do.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.827
What's wrong?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.997
I'm -- I'm in a little bit
of a jam

04:24.030 --> 04:27.200
and I need to
do a guy a favor.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.604
I'm listening.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.508
The guy's my bookie.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.412
I don't gamble anymore.
Trust me.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.281
You do not have to worry
about that

04:41.314 --> 04:44.417
because I have definitely
learned my lesson.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.052
What do you owe?

04:46.086 --> 04:48.088
$27,000.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.928
It started small
to make the games

04:54.961 --> 04:56.930
more interesting.
That's all.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.799
Last season, I did okay --

04:58.832 --> 05:01.201
Better than okay.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.270
Started thinking
I knew what I was doing.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.974
What's the case?

05:10.577 --> 05:13.614
His ex-wife is suing him
for fraud.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.881
He won the lottery.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.650
She's claiming
he didn't tell her.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.385
Lottery? For how much?

05:19.419 --> 05:20.887
Well, $100,000.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.890
He says he bought the ticket
with separate funds.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.527
The lottery commission's
holding all the money

05:26.560 --> 05:28.662
until the ownership issues
are resolved.

05:28.695 --> 05:33.534
Anything I can get him
over 70 comes off my tab.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.470
It's one day's work --
two at the most.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.010
She did everything right.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.681
She stayed calm,
she avoided eye contact,

05:47.714 --> 05:50.517
and she gave up the money
without a fight.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.819
He shot her anyway.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.556
It's a miracle
she didn't die.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.625
When did you arrive
on the scene, Detective?

05:58.659 --> 06:01.895
Within minutes. There was
another woman at the store.

06:01.928 --> 06:06.032
An eyewitness -- Martha McKee.
She's the one that called 911.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.333
What happened
after you arrived?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.637
Well, we got a description
of the shooter from Mrs. McKee.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.173
We pulled the surveillance tape
and started canvassing the area.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.876
We found the defendant
less than two blocks away.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.277
What was he doing?

06:17.310 --> 06:20.046
Sitting on a stoop, drinking
beer with some of his friends.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.549
He was dressed
just like on the tape --

06:22.583 --> 06:24.551
Same sweatshirt, everything.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.520
What did you do next,
detective?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.889
We placed him under arrest
and searched him.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.658
We found $580 in his pocket.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.294
This witness -- Mrs. McKee --
did she attempt to make

06:34.327 --> 06:36.830
a formal identification
of the suspect?

06:36.863 --> 06:38.532
Yes, we showed her
a photo six-pack.

06:43.003 --> 06:43.970
This one?

06:44.004 --> 06:47.974
Yes. She positively
identified photo number 2

06:48.008 --> 06:49.275
as the man
who shot the clerk.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.812
And whose photograph
is in the number 2 slot?

06:51.845 --> 06:56.216
Photo number 2 is him,
the defendant Martin Jenks.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.954
The clerk who was shot --
did she identify my client?

07:00.987 --> 07:03.123
No, she couldn't make
any identification.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.791
None at all?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.860
She knew it was
a white male. That's all.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.829
When you found my client,
detective,

07:08.862 --> 07:10.296
did you find a gun on him?

07:10.330 --> 07:11.732
No, we never found
a weapon.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.499
Any fingerprints
at the scene?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.101
He was wearing gloves.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.937
Did you find the gloves?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.605
No.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.308
It went good.
Didn't it?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.912
Well...it looked like you
on the tape.

07:25.946 --> 07:26.847
"It looked like me" --

07:26.880 --> 07:28.348
Half my block has
a sweatshirt like that.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.383
It's not
just the sweatshirt, Martin.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.553
They've got that witness.
Who's wrong.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.555
Wrong, but unequivocal,

07:34.588 --> 07:37.157
and she's
a pretty credible person --

07:37.190 --> 07:39.259
Selectman, school committee
member in Braintree --

07:39.292 --> 07:40.594
She's wrong!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.464
Okay,
you need to calm down.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.202
Here's the problem.
If I put you on the stand,

07:49.235 --> 07:50.571
the jury could learn
about your record --

07:50.604 --> 07:52.573
What, for getting high?
Stealing some CDs?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.307
I don't take off stores
with guns.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.576
I don't shoot people.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.710
I believe you,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.146
but I'm telling you
I met with this witness.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.048
I talked to her myself.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.286
I'm worried that the jury
will take her word.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.788
Well, that can't be enough
to put me in jail.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.323
It is enough.
She's an eyewitness.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.793
Throw in the hooded sweatshirt,
the cash in your pocket --

08:12.826 --> 08:16.296
I told you I earned that money
busing tables downtown --

08:16.329 --> 08:17.931
in an off-the-books job
for $200 a week.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.733
You were carrying $600.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.675
These are the questions
you will be asked.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.015
All the money I got,
I carry.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
It just...

08:37.984 --> 08:39.753
it makes me feel big,
you know?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.256
So why, all of a sudden,
do you think

08:44.290 --> 08:45.792
I'm going to lose?
Tell me that.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.128
Sometimes you get
a feel in the room,

08:48.161 --> 08:50.797
and I just don't like
the one I'm getting here.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.667
That police officer seemed
pretty persuasive.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.836
I didn't like the way
the jury was looking at you.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.504
I didn't do anything.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.306
I know that,

09:00.340 --> 09:05.646
but if we lose,
attempted murder is 15-to-life.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.951
And your mother
not showing up?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.587
That didn't help.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.594
Promise me
I won't go to jail.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.230
I can't make that promise.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.634
Please,
let me try to plead.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.369
If I can get
a reduced sentence --

09:29.402 --> 09:30.904
Please.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.978
The problem is

09:38.011 --> 09:40.881
you bought the lottery ticket
on July 18th.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.249
You won the money
on the 22nd.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.953
The divorce became final
on the 28th.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.658
Why -- why is this
a problem?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
Legally,
she's entitled to half.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.130
Yeah, but I'm not hiring you
for a legal opinion, Jimmy.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.566
You got to figure out

09:59.600 --> 10:01.868
how to keep her
from getting any.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.770
We would have to show

10:03.804 --> 10:06.472
the ticket was bought
with segregated funds.

10:06.507 --> 10:09.643
But we've been over this.
I told you I did.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.177
Yes, but your word --

10:11.211 --> 10:15.516
I segregated the money aside
in anticipation of the divorce.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.751
I bought the ticket
with that money.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.186
I'm not sure
the Judge will believe that,

10:20.220 --> 10:23.323
and if he thinks you're trying
to commit a fraud,

10:23.356 --> 10:24.858
he could give it all to her.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.360
That's what
I'm most worried about.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.029
Listen to me.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.766
I already give her
6,000 bucks a month --

10:32.799 --> 10:35.068
more than I have to...
Which we will point out.

10:35.101 --> 10:38.171
Just to keep her yap shut
about what I do.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.272
Which we will not point out.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.575
Do you know
what she does all day?

10:41.608 --> 10:43.577
Gets her nails done
and bangs her boyfriend --

10:43.610 --> 10:47.047
6,000 bucks a month.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.516
This is how
she shows her gratitude.

10:49.550 --> 10:52.185
I'd like to try
to settle this.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.419
Why?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.855
Because I don't want it
coming down

10:54.888 --> 10:57.758
to your demeanor
or your word of honor.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.163
I got a meeting set up
with her attorney.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.900
If I could get 60 for you,
40 for her --

11:06.933 --> 11:08.134
That does you no good.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.336
I understand that,
but we got to look

11:10.370 --> 11:11.838
at what
we're faced with here.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.307
The Judge could
give her 60-40,

11:14.340 --> 11:15.976
and if he should
give it all to her --

11:16.009 --> 11:17.511
I'll kill her first.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.919
Maybe that should be
our strategy here.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.988
We tell her,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.957
"walk away
for health reasons."

11:32.693 --> 11:33.794
Are you threatening her?

11:33.827 --> 11:37.564
I'm using you
to intimidate her.

11:37.598 --> 11:40.066
Are you threatening her life?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.303
Of course not.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.977
Just get my money.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.457
You just take your time,
all right?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.727
Keep your answers short
and try to look at the jury.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.096
Is this attorney aggressive?
She didn't seem so.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.965
She'll be tougher in Court
than when she interviewed you,

12:11.998 --> 12:14.535
but you just stick to
what you saw and you'll be fine.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.602
Okay.

12:15.636 --> 12:18.705
All right. I'll see you
at 8:45 tomorrow -- sharp.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.640
Okay.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.440
(knock on door)

12:20.473 --> 12:21.141
Come in.

12:22.709 --> 12:23.877
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.178
No, it's all right.
We're just finishing.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.180
I believe you know
Martha McKee.
We've met.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.115
Hello again.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.784
We'll see you
tomorrow -- 8:45.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.785
Okay.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.822
(door closes)

12:35.856 --> 12:37.023
She's wrong about the I. D.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.593
You came here
to tell me that?

12:39.626 --> 12:42.195
She was scared to death,
probably focused on the gun,

12:42.228 --> 12:44.798
and we both know how unreliable
eyewitnesses can be.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.733
I'm not pleading out.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.134
He's got no priors
for violence

12:48.168 --> 12:49.536
and sitting
less than two blocks away

12:49.570 --> 12:52.172
in the same sweatshirt?
How stupid could he be?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.007
What about the cash?
$600? That's --

12:54.040 --> 12:55.976
He likes to carry cash.
There's nothing illegal --

12:56.009 --> 12:57.177
No deal.

12:59.045 --> 13:02.015
Look. I've been doing this
a long time

13:02.048 --> 13:05.519
and I'm not in the habit
of believing all my clients.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.188
I think he's innocent.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.726
12 years --
That's the best I can do.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.260
Come in with five,
I'll sell it.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.663
Well, I'm sure you would,
but I'm offering 12.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.431
He's 19.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.568
12 years in prison...
He'll never recover.

13:21.602 --> 13:23.269
Can't do it.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.072
I'm asking a favor.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.775
I'm sorry.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.419
When's
the settlement conference?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.587
20 minutes.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.093
So, when did all this start?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.831
The gambling.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.466
I told you.
Nickel-and-Dime bets

13:53.499 --> 13:55.301
to make the games
interesting.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.972
Then, you know, uh,
I upped it

13:59.005 --> 14:01.575
to make my life interesting.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.979
You get addicted
to the risk, I guess.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.815
Which means you have to bet more
than you can afford to lose.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.817
I ain't doin' it
anymore.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.753
Jimmy, if it's
an addiction --

14:12.786 --> 14:16.289
My cousin's in one of those
gambling anonymous clubs.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.958
Odds are I'll go.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.261
That was a joke.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.129
I'm not laughing.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.632
Hey, let's not forget
how I got here.

14:25.666 --> 14:27.701
I falsified loan documents

14:27.734 --> 14:29.469
and got myself fired
from a bank.

14:29.503 --> 14:30.671
That's my legacy.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.639
That's not your legacy.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.978
If you're trying to tell me
you're not smarter than this,

14:39.012 --> 14:40.747
I don't buy it.

14:40.781 --> 14:45.519
I'm not gambling anymore.
You have my word.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.892
Listen. I appreciate you not

14:51.925 --> 14:54.961
telling the others about --

14:58.364 --> 14:59.633
(knock on door)

14:59.666 --> 15:01.467
(door opens)

15:01.502 --> 15:03.537
Stuart Miller and client.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.805
Send them in.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.341
You okay to do this?

15:08.374 --> 15:10.744
Fine.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.316
(ring)

15:16.349 --> 15:18.018
Hello?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.686
Speaking.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.559
When?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.363
Oh, god.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.137
Yeah, okay.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.243
How?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.012
Heart attack.
She was just in my office.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.981
It happened on the drive home.
She's D. O. A.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.082
And this was
your eyewitness?

15:49.115 --> 15:51.618
Yes. My only eyewitness,
but she hadn't testified.

15:51.652 --> 15:53.053
She's due up next.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.090
Any recorded testimony
of any...

15:58.158 --> 15:59.760
I still got
the videotape.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.328
We got the clothes.
Maybe if I can sell --

16:02.362 --> 16:04.865
No gun? No prints?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.468
Without that eyewitness,

16:08.502 --> 16:10.737
the Judge will knock you out
under rule 25

16:10.771 --> 16:12.573
before it even gets
to the jury.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.142
Any chance
she'll put the defendant up?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.444
No, she's too smart.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.214
I think we're dead.

16:29.690 --> 16:32.092
Does Dole know
the witness is dead?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.962
No, I don't think so --
certainly not from me.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.133
Then there's still time.
Plead it out.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.704
Excuse me.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.906
You heard me.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.108
Kenny, I think
I have to tell her.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.978
No, you don't.
It isn't exculpatory evidence.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.780
You don't have to tell her
anything about this.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.953
Plead it out -- quick.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.028
I think we can all agree

17:08.060 --> 17:10.030
if we could work this out
amicably,

17:10.063 --> 17:10.896
it would save time --

17:10.931 --> 17:12.232
Oh, is that
the goal here --

17:12.265 --> 17:13.967
that we all get amicable?
Vicky.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.869
That the purpose of the fraud
is to bring us tight?

17:16.903 --> 17:18.338
This is her -- charming.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.406
Okay.
This isn't a good start.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.977
Look. The legal reality here
is not complicated.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.279
The lottery ticket was purchased
before the divorce.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.281
The prize was won
before the divorce.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.116
The money is
marital property.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.886
Not if he bought the ticket
with segregated funds.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.487
Do you have any records
from any bank accounts...

17:34.521 --> 17:36.056
I kept it cash.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.824
Oh, you can't even
lie well.

17:37.858 --> 17:40.460
All right. Anger isn't
going to help things.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.462
Anger is all he left me with,
Mr. Berluti.

17:42.495 --> 17:46.032
He divorced me
because he won the lottery.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.668
That is not true.
Sid...

17:47.701 --> 17:51.505
No, the marriage was dead.
We were no longer intimate.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.306
We didn't, uh, communicate.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.041
Communicate?

17:55.075 --> 17:57.678
You couldn't communicate
that you won the lottery.

17:57.711 --> 17:59.379
Or that you were
a bitch.
Hey!

17:59.412 --> 18:00.714
Play the tape.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.282
Vicky, I really prefer --

18:02.315 --> 18:03.750
Play the tape.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.253
(opens briefcase)

18:07.988 --> 18:09.455
What tape?

18:09.489 --> 18:12.593
This would be July 14th,
shortly before the lottery.

18:12.626 --> 18:13.794
May I?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.128
What is this?

18:15.161 --> 18:17.698
I believe
it speaks for itself.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.701
May I?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.903
Go ahead.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.938
You don't think I kept records
of certain things, Sid?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.439
What's going on?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.847
(moaning)

18:37.117 --> 18:40.621
This would be
your client here

18:40.654 --> 18:43.123
with the, uh,
female undergarments,

18:44.490 --> 18:47.994
and that would be
my client there

18:48.028 --> 18:51.197
with the, uh, apparatus.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.500
My client, from this angle,

18:54.535 --> 18:57.070
is on top of your client
right there...

18:57.103 --> 18:58.772
Turn it off.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.344
First of all,
that isn't relevant.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.346
As distasteful
as it is, Mr. Berluti,

19:06.379 --> 19:09.182
I'm afraid it is relevant.
Your client is claiming

19:09.215 --> 19:11.384
that the marriage was dead
before the lottery.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.620
He's saying
that there was no intimacy.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.557
Well, although
admittedly unconventional,

19:16.590 --> 19:19.359
that was conjugal activity
on that tape,

19:19.392 --> 19:21.595
and should this go to Court,
we will introduce it.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.796
I'll suppress it.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.164
I doubt it.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.401
Okay, here's the deal.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.738
I get 70 and you get 30.

19:31.772 --> 19:34.741
Just bend over
and take it, Sid.

19:34.775 --> 19:37.177
You never minded before.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.316
(elevator dings)

19:45.051 --> 19:47.654
Alan, these are the results
of our polygraph.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.855
He passed convincingly.

19:48.889 --> 19:50.423
Come on, Lindsay.
For all I know,

19:50.456 --> 19:52.593
you tested him 10 times
and he passed once.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.628
I didn't.
He's innocent, Alan.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.063
He stands to be convicted
for wearing a green sweatshirt.

19:57.097 --> 19:58.298
He didn't do it.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.299
(sighs)

19:59.332 --> 20:00.934
Look at his record,
for god's sake.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.070
He's never committed
any kind of violent crime.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.577
I need a favor here.

20:12.513 --> 20:14.314
Five years,
five more probation,

20:14.347 --> 20:18.151
and he waives parole.
That's the best I can do.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.057
(sighs)

20:25.358 --> 20:26.326
I'm not doing five years.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.761
Martin...
No!

20:27.794 --> 20:29.462
It's a good deal.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.331
Sending me to jail
for something I didn't do?

20:31.364 --> 20:33.366
The guy who shot that woman
is still out there.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.367
Don't they care about that?

20:34.400 --> 20:36.236
I don't care about him.
I care about you.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.839
I don't want you doing
15 years.
It's not the truth!

20:38.872 --> 20:42.475
Forget about the truth.
It doesn't work that way.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.984
I can't win this trial.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.121
If I thought I could...

20:58.191 --> 21:01.528
five years --
you still have a life left.

21:01.562 --> 21:03.730
15 -- you don't.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.437
Your Honor,
we've reached an agreement.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.906
Is that right,
Ms. Dole?

21:12.939 --> 21:13.940
Yes, Your Honor.

21:13.974 --> 21:16.009
My client is prepared
to enter a change of plea.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.145
Mr. Jenks, is it your desire
to plead guilty at this time?

21:19.179 --> 21:22.215
(voice breaking)
Yes, uh, yes. Ahem.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.750
I need you
to speak up, son.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.652
Yes.

21:25.686 --> 21:27.854
All right.
Now I need to ask you

21:27.888 --> 21:29.523
some questions
for the record.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.825
Okay.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.161
Is your decision to plead guilty
being made voluntarily?

21:35.195 --> 21:37.197
Yes.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.733
Did you talk about it
with your attorney?

21:41.001 --> 21:42.168
Yes.

21:42.202 --> 21:44.971
You understand that by pleading
you're waiving your right

21:45.005 --> 21:47.407
to cross-examine witnesses,
present evidence,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.042
and have a jury
decide your guilt?

21:50.777 --> 21:52.145
Yes.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.214
Ms. Dole,

21:54.247 --> 21:56.717
have you advised your client
regarding this plea?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.151
I have, Your Honor.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.485
And you concur with it?

21:59.520 --> 22:00.954
I do.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.525
All right, before I can
formally take the guilty plea,

22:04.558 --> 22:06.026
I need the defendant
to establish

22:06.059 --> 22:07.493
a factual basis for it.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.500
What she said, um,

22:14.535 --> 22:16.637
my lawyer already told you.
I want to plead guilty.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.104
Martin, you have to --

22:18.138 --> 22:21.642
Son, I need you to tell me
what you did in your own words.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.144
Otherwise,
I can't accept your plea.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.715
I, um...

22:30.651 --> 22:33.820
I did what the prosecutor
said I did.

22:33.854 --> 22:36.056
You robbed and then shot

22:36.089 --> 22:38.124
the woman
in the convenience store?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.494
Yes.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.665
So, as to the charge
of attempted murder,

22:44.698 --> 22:45.999
you wish to plead guilty?

22:54.941 --> 22:55.609
Yes.

22:55.642 --> 22:56.977
Very well.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.979
The plea is accepted.
Mr. Lowe?

22:59.012 --> 23:00.781
Commonwealth moves
for remand.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.283
Granted. The defendant is
remanded into custody

23:03.316 --> 23:05.519
pending sentencing,
and we are adjourned.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.186
(bangs gavel)

23:06.219 --> 23:07.554
Are you okay?

23:23.737 --> 23:25.506
Thank you.

23:25.539 --> 23:27.340
Okay.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.110
I won't forget it.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.661
This is not a good result,
Jimmy.

23:47.694 --> 23:51.397
I'm due 50. I hire you
to try to bump it up to 70,

23:51.431 --> 23:54.100
and now you're advising me
to take 30?

23:54.134 --> 23:55.636
It's not a good result.

23:55.669 --> 23:57.804
If you want to go to trial,
I will do that.

23:57.838 --> 24:00.907
What's the chance of that tape
coming into play?

24:00.941 --> 24:03.109
I'd bring a motion in liminie
to try to prevent that,

24:03.143 --> 24:06.012
but I can't guarantee
success.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.884
If you're worried about
people seeing that video,

24:10.917 --> 24:12.052
and having seen it,

24:12.085 --> 24:14.521
I would say your concern
is a good one,

24:14.555 --> 24:17.190
I'd settle.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.960
And just let her win?

24:19.993 --> 24:22.896
I don't know
what else to tell you.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.705
Don't you look comfortable.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.273
Hey, between a trial
and a baby at home,

24:33.306 --> 24:36.510
if I find a quiet moment,
I seize it.

24:36.543 --> 24:37.711
You got a problem
with that?

24:37.744 --> 24:40.413
Evidently not.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.248
I only came into work today
because I'm exhausted.

24:42.282 --> 24:44.017
Tell me about it.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.686
Hey, Lindsay,
did you see this?

24:45.719 --> 24:49.222
Today's obit page.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.391
What?

24:51.424 --> 24:55.195
Witness in my trial died --
a heart attack.

24:55.228 --> 24:58.732
One of yours or theirs?

24:58.765 --> 25:01.635
Theirs.

25:02.168 --> 25:02.803
(door opens)

25:02.836 --> 25:04.337
You knew she was dead.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.839
If you're going
to yell --

25:05.872 --> 25:08.308
I'm not yelling.
I am using a firm voice.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.110
You knew she was dead.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.516
This case was over.

25:16.817 --> 25:18.819
Without that witness,
you had to dismiss.

25:18.852 --> 25:19.753
Not true.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.187
It's fraud.
You intentionally withheld --

25:21.221 --> 25:23.089
Hey, your client committed
attempted murder.

25:23.123 --> 25:26.292
Five years for that is a gift,
for your information.

25:26.326 --> 25:27.293
I'm filing a motion
to vacate the plea,

25:27.327 --> 25:29.195
and then I'm going
straight to your supervisor.

25:29.229 --> 25:31.431
Let me
save you the trouble.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.000
Mr. Lowe was acting
under my direction

25:34.034 --> 25:36.102
and with my complete approval.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.440
What, so this was
a conspiracy to mislead me?

25:40.473 --> 25:42.475
We were acting within
the ethical boundaries --

25:42.509 --> 25:46.312
That's crap. You lied to me.
You withheld material evidence.

25:46.346 --> 25:48.281
It is not evidence,
Ms. Dole, and further--

25:48.314 --> 25:50.016
You can't sit on that kind
of information, not when --

25:50.050 --> 25:52.285
You got the deal
you were asking for.

25:52.318 --> 25:55.255
You pushed for it,
not us.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.925
Are you serious?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.528
We did nothing wrong.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.810
First,
you need to calm down.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.879
Don't tell me to calm down.
You calm down.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.881
Okay, I'm going to take a second
and calm myself down.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.216
You think this is funny?
I think it's disgusting,

26:23.249 --> 26:25.686
and I think all three of us
should go into Court,

26:25.719 --> 26:28.321
but we can't in
with emotion, Lindsay.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.690
He would have walked.

26:29.723 --> 26:31.157
An innocent kid is
doing five years --

26:31.191 --> 26:33.159
Let's do some research
on whether it qualifies

26:33.193 --> 26:35.929
as exculpatory
or denial of due process.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.031
Eugene, maybe you
and Rebecca can get on that.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.000
You need
to draft a declaration

26:40.033 --> 26:43.369
setting forth
exactly what Lowe told you.

26:43.403 --> 26:44.838
I'll mark up the motion
with the clerk's office.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.140
We can't let them get
away with this, Bobby.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.141
We can't.

26:49.743 --> 26:51.578
Can I help you, Lucy?

26:51.612 --> 26:53.880
Jimmy's case is over.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.670
Jimmy,
what are you doing here?

27:16.703 --> 27:19.740
Family lawyer.
Can I see?

27:19.773 --> 27:21.341
It's not going
to make your day.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.309
I'd like to see.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.821
Shots were heard
less than an hour ago.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.691
Witnesses?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.593
Nobody yet.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.862
Your client's over here.

27:49.803 --> 27:52.305
That's not my client,
actually.

27:54.307 --> 27:57.210
I represent her husband.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.780
We heard they're
going through a divorce.

28:01.648 --> 28:03.650
Yeah.

28:04.818 --> 28:05.652
Would you happen to know

28:05.686 --> 28:07.721
where your client is
right now, Jimmy?

28:10.490 --> 28:12.192
No.

28:20.033 --> 28:22.302
Well, can I
take my plea back now?

28:22.335 --> 28:23.770
I don't know.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.772
That's what we'll be going
into Court to ask for.

28:25.806 --> 28:27.741
They can just lie
like this?

28:27.774 --> 28:29.275
I'm not sure.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.712
I've never really heard
of this happening before.

28:33.714 --> 28:38.018
So...When -- When you were
convincing me to plea,

28:38.051 --> 28:40.386
the witness was
already dead?

28:40.420 --> 28:42.488
Yes.

28:44.925 --> 28:47.160
We're going
to fight this, Martin.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.834
I stood up in Court
and I told the Judge --

28:53.867 --> 28:58.672
everybody -- that I did it,
and I didn't.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.908
I've got my whole firm
on it now.

29:01.942 --> 29:05.178
We're in before Judge Wilcox
tomorrow.

29:05.211 --> 29:08.048
Well, do you think
we'll win?

29:09.516 --> 29:14.220
We have a real chance.
This isn't over.

29:30.571 --> 29:32.873
Any listening devices
in there?

29:32.906 --> 29:34.575
None.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.054
You believe this?
They think I whacked her.

29:48.655 --> 29:50.390
Did you?

29:52.926 --> 29:56.062
I am shocked that you would
ask me that, Jimmy.

29:58.331 --> 30:00.734
Check my alibi,
you want peace of mind.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.603
Did you have it done?

30:02.636 --> 30:04.838
All right,
just get me out.

30:10.844 --> 30:12.513
What have you told them?

30:13.814 --> 30:15.616
Nothing.

30:15.649 --> 30:18.118
Just asked for my lawyer --
period.

30:18.151 --> 30:22.022
I didn't even so much as express
grief over my wife's demise,

30:22.055 --> 30:23.557
which was difficult.

30:27.928 --> 30:29.763
Get me out.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.203
I understand
they don't like it,

30:37.237 --> 30:39.606
but the fact remains
this plea is valid.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.742
It was a violation
of due process.

30:41.775 --> 30:44.377
It was made in bad faith
and secured by fraud.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.712
We did no such thing.

30:45.746 --> 30:48.181
You deliberately withheld
material evidence.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.751
We have a duty to disclose
exculpatory evidence --

30:50.784 --> 30:53.186
evidence that shows
he didn't commit the crime.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.721
The fact
that our witness died

30:54.755 --> 30:56.857
has nothing to do
with whether he's guilty.

30:56.890 --> 30:58.792
It went to whether
you even had a case.

30:58.825 --> 31:00.193
Mr. Donnell, your client

31:00.226 --> 31:02.195
accepted the plea
in my courtroom.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.164
I heard it.
He stood right there

31:04.197 --> 31:06.166
and admitted he robbed
and shot that woman.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.467
Which was extortion.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.635
Extortion?
Ms. Dole?

31:08.669 --> 31:11.772
Martin Jenks has always
maintained his innocence.

31:11.805 --> 31:14.007
He took this plea
because I forced him to

31:14.040 --> 31:16.142
because I believed the
eyewitness was ready to testify.

31:16.176 --> 31:18.344
Lawyers play poker
all the time.

31:18.378 --> 31:19.646
Oh, don't insult me
or this Court

31:19.680 --> 31:21.682
by calling
what you did "poker."
Lindsay.

31:21.715 --> 31:24.951
Your honor, every defendant
who pleads takes a chance.

31:24.985 --> 31:27.253
He's gambling that he'll be
better off pleading guilty

31:27.287 --> 31:29.455
than going to trial
and getting convicted.

31:29.489 --> 31:32.593
Sometimes he's right
and sometimes he's wrong,

31:32.626 --> 31:35.195
but the law doesn't permit him
to withdraw his plea

31:35.228 --> 31:36.730
because he later learns

31:36.763 --> 31:39.099
that he overestimated
the strength of our case.

31:39.132 --> 31:41.568
This wasn't an estimation.
Who's arguing here?

31:41.602 --> 31:43.704
Whatever chance they had
at winning at trial

31:43.737 --> 31:46.973
died along with Mrs. McKee.
As an officer of the Court,

31:47.007 --> 31:49.409
Mr. Lowe was obligated
to reveal that to me

31:49.442 --> 31:50.777
as well as to you,
Your Honor.

31:50.811 --> 31:53.980
There is no such obligation
in either case law or statute.

31:54.014 --> 31:56.216
What about
fundamental fairness?

31:57.951 --> 31:59.953
Your honor, over 90%
of all criminal cases

31:59.986 --> 32:01.522
are resolved by plea bargains.

32:01.555 --> 32:04.891
To work, the whole system
has to be based on trust.

32:04.925 --> 32:07.694
Mr. Lowe and Mr. Walsh
violated that trust.

32:07.728 --> 32:09.530
The system is doing fine,
Ms. Dole,

32:09.563 --> 32:12.498
and the right man is behind bars
where he belongs.

32:12.533 --> 32:14.735
Perhaps what's really
going on here is

32:14.768 --> 32:16.302
Ms. Dole's concerned
about her own actions.

32:16.336 --> 32:18.071
I didn't know I was
negotiating with liars.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.072
I object to that.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.207
You're a liar.
Ms. Dole...

32:21.241 --> 32:23.944
They care more about railroading
people than doing justice.

32:23.977 --> 32:27.514
Martin Jenks is in jail right
now for something he didn't do.

32:27.548 --> 32:28.782
That fact doesn't seem

32:28.815 --> 32:31.451
to bother the D. A.'s office.
It should bother this Court.

32:31.484 --> 32:32.553
It bothers the Court

32:32.586 --> 32:34.354
that you forced your client
to enter a guilty plea.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.356
I persuaded him,
thinking that --
You said "forced."

32:36.389 --> 32:37.323
Let me talk.

32:52.573 --> 32:54.541
We make our decisions,

32:54.575 --> 32:58.378
and -- and, yes, we...
force our clients' hands

32:58.411 --> 33:00.446
based
on the case they have --

33:00.480 --> 33:04.284
whether they can
make their burden.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.386
This case was a lie,

33:06.419 --> 33:08.655
a knowing lie,

33:08.689 --> 33:12.893
which my client relied on
to his detriment.

33:29.142 --> 33:30.644
Did I lose it?

33:30.677 --> 33:31.845
A little.

33:31.878 --> 33:34.648
But I think
you did fine.

33:34.681 --> 33:38.018
Hopefully your passion...

33:38.051 --> 33:39.352
will count.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.356
He said 20 minutes.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.976
As far as the police
are concerned,

34:03.009 --> 34:04.344
there's still no evidence.

34:04.377 --> 34:06.613
Which there wouldn't be
'cause I'm innocent.

34:06.647 --> 34:07.814
Right.

34:07.848 --> 34:10.650
What about the status
of the lottery winnings?

34:10.684 --> 34:13.620
Your wife's estate
can still make a claim.

34:13.654 --> 34:14.821
Do you want me
to follow up on that?

34:14.855 --> 34:16.089
No.

34:16.121 --> 34:19.893
Think I might engage
new counsel, just the same.

34:20.994 --> 34:23.063
So, I guess
we're done, then.

34:23.096 --> 34:26.199
Done? You still owe me
the 27, Jimmy.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.635
Didn't exactly work that off.

34:28.668 --> 34:30.837
I think we're done, Sid.

34:30.871 --> 34:33.574
If I was in a position
to be charitable,

34:33.607 --> 34:34.574
that would be one thing,

34:34.608 --> 34:37.277
but I got debts
to pay off.

34:38.779 --> 34:40.581
What do you say
you walk out the door,

34:40.614 --> 34:44.284
forget my debt,
and I'll forget

34:44.317 --> 34:46.820
how you threatened
to kill your wife?

34:46.853 --> 34:48.855
Privileged.

34:48.889 --> 34:50.524
Bodily threats
don't apply to --

34:50.556 --> 34:53.493
So, why didn't you
blow your whistle?

34:55.562 --> 34:57.731
If you thought I was
going to hurt her

34:57.764 --> 34:58.999
and you stayed quiet,

34:59.032 --> 35:01.434
that doesn't look good
for you, does it?

35:03.336 --> 35:06.372
You want to know how big
your gambling jones is, Jimmy?

35:06.406 --> 35:08.509
You didn't want to hear it
as a real threat

35:08.542 --> 35:11.277
because you wanted
to pay off those bets.

35:11.311 --> 35:13.580
(laughs softly)

35:13.614 --> 35:19.485
The truth is, I got more on you
than you got on me.

35:21.421 --> 35:25.859
I'm asking you to get
out of this office now.

35:25.892 --> 35:27.828
You're making me upset.

35:29.262 --> 35:32.799
From what you've seen,
do I respond to stress good?

35:32.833 --> 35:35.569
You're threatening me now?

35:39.840 --> 35:41.808
Of course not.

35:48.381 --> 35:49.583
I will say this.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.287
You don't even know
what you're into.

35:57.357 --> 36:01.762
I need that money.
I'll give you a week.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.746
Close the door, please.

36:22.849 --> 36:23.950
We're doing this in here

36:23.984 --> 36:26.052
because some of what I want
to say is off the record.

36:26.853 --> 36:28.622
Actually, it's our
office policy

36:28.655 --> 36:30.090
that a Court reporter
be present for --

36:30.123 --> 36:32.793
Mr. Lowe, I don't really care
at this moment

36:32.826 --> 36:34.327
about your office policy.

36:36.396 --> 36:39.099
We're fine without
a Court reporter, Your Honor.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.605
Mr. Walsh,
I've known you a long time,

36:44.638 --> 36:46.507
and I've known you to be
a straight shooter.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.976
But I am very troubled by
the due process implications

36:50.010 --> 36:51.477
of what happened here.

36:51.512 --> 36:55.181
Your honor, this defendant
committed a violent --
Save it.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.650
There are no reporters present,

36:56.683 --> 36:58.819
and I don't need to hear
your stump speech.

37:00.521 --> 37:03.690
Then we'll submit on our
prior argument

37:03.724 --> 37:05.926
and again ask this Court
to deny

37:05.959 --> 37:08.595
defendant's motion
to withdraw his plea.

37:08.629 --> 37:11.598
Fine.

37:11.632 --> 37:14.267
I brought you in here,
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Lowe,

37:14.300 --> 37:17.137
rather than embarrass you
in public,

37:17.170 --> 37:18.038
because I wanted to tell you

37:18.071 --> 37:19.706
that there is something
more important

37:19.740 --> 37:22.242
than the mere holding
of a case.

37:22.275 --> 37:24.377
I am talking
about fair and unfair,

37:24.410 --> 37:26.680
right and wrong,

37:26.713 --> 37:28.682
and what happened
in this case is wrong.

37:30.784 --> 37:34.020
And it sickens me that you two
can't see that.

37:39.325 --> 37:43.096
Everything I said in Court,
and I mean everything,

37:43.129 --> 37:45.165
was a correct statement
of the law.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.834
And since we're
off the record,

37:47.868 --> 37:49.202
let me just say frankly

37:49.235 --> 37:50.971
that I don't need lectures
from Your Honor

37:51.004 --> 37:52.038
about right and wrong.

37:53.173 --> 37:54.374
Mr. Jenks pled guilty

37:54.407 --> 37:57.243
because he is guilty,
and neither the law

37:57.277 --> 37:59.580
nor anybody's misplaced
sense of injustice

37:59.613 --> 38:02.482
allows him to withdraw
that plea.

38:02.516 --> 38:03.950
That's the law.

38:07.821 --> 38:11.057
The law also allows me
to throw your ass in a cell

38:11.091 --> 38:12.492
for contempt.

38:13.493 --> 38:15.562
I don't mean to show
Your Honor disrespect,

38:15.596 --> 38:17.598
but I will remind
Your Honor

38:17.631 --> 38:20.166
that district attorneys
are officers of the Court

38:20.200 --> 38:22.736
who must conduct themselves
in accordance

38:22.769 --> 38:24.304
with established law.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.239
Mr. Lowe and I did that,

38:26.272 --> 38:28.575
and we don't need
to be brought into chambers

38:28.609 --> 38:30.110
to be told
how we sicken you.

38:30.143 --> 38:33.013
Say it out there, where
you'll be held accountable.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.883
I am saying it here.

38:44.558 --> 38:47.427
And if I had a choice,
I would set aside this plea,

38:47.460 --> 38:51.832
but --
Your honor, please.

38:51.865 --> 38:55.401
I cannot throw out a knowing
and voluntary plea of guilty

38:55.435 --> 38:56.803
on these facts.

38:56.837 --> 38:59.906
You negotiated what you thought
was a good deal.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.708
You could have advised
your client

39:01.742 --> 39:02.976
to continue with the trial,

39:03.009 --> 39:05.879
challenge the evidence.
You didn't.

39:05.912 --> 39:09.315
The law doesn't allow you
to benefit from regret.

39:09.349 --> 39:12.686
It is my regret as well.

39:12.719 --> 39:15.622
I am very sorry.

39:18.191 --> 39:21.027
Defendant's motion is denied.

40:00.701 --> 40:02.368
Lindsay.

40:04.971 --> 40:07.808
I respect that it's
an adversary process,

40:07.841 --> 40:09.710
but I didn't come to you
as an adversary.

40:09.743 --> 40:11.011
I dropped my sword
and asked for a favor,

40:11.044 --> 40:13.046
and you played it
like a favor.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.048
That isn't gamesmanship,
Alan.

40:15.081 --> 40:17.984
It was dishonest.
You know it, I know it.

40:18.018 --> 40:19.853
I gather you can live with it.

40:19.886 --> 40:23.256
There's an innocent kid
in prison who may not.

40:36.369 --> 40:38.605
(zips purse)

40:38.639 --> 40:41.141
All right, I'm gone.

40:42.442 --> 40:43.276
Can you lock up?

40:43.309 --> 40:45.145
Sure.

40:47.247 --> 40:48.682
Can I ask you something,
Jimmy?

40:50.551 --> 40:51.985
Did he do it?

40:53.820 --> 40:57.724
Oh, come on.
Privilege extends to me.

40:57.758 --> 40:59.492
Throw me a bone.

40:59.526 --> 41:01.461
He says he didn't.

41:01.494 --> 41:03.096
Right.

41:09.870 --> 41:10.971
Earth to Jimmy.

41:13.139 --> 41:14.875
Are you okay?

41:14.908 --> 41:17.544
Yeah. I'll lock up.

41:18.344 --> 41:19.780
Good night.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.347
Night.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.090
(door closes)

41:50.877 --> 41:53.446
They're coming to take you
to Concord.

41:53.479 --> 41:55.549
It's a high-security prison.

41:55.582 --> 41:56.583
Tonight?

41:57.618 --> 41:59.786
Yeah.

42:00.453 --> 42:02.523
Everybody convicted
of a violent crime

42:02.556 --> 42:04.691
goes there first.

42:06.927 --> 42:08.662
I'm going to petition
the department of corrections

42:08.695 --> 42:10.230
to move you
as soon as possible.

42:11.297 --> 42:13.033
Oh.

42:13.066 --> 42:14.968
I'm also going to ask them
to designate you

42:15.001 --> 42:16.637
a vulnerable inmate.

42:19.205 --> 42:20.741
Okay.

42:20.774 --> 42:22.242
It may take a while.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.945
In the meantime,
I've requested

42:24.978 --> 42:27.213
that they keep you
in solitary,

42:27.247 --> 42:29.650
but I can't guarantee
they'll do it.

42:32.753 --> 42:35.789
I'll get another lawyer
to handle your appeal,

42:35.822 --> 42:38.024
a specialist,
the best I can find.

42:38.058 --> 42:42.763
I'll ask him to argue
that I was ineffective,

42:42.796 --> 42:46.867
that you had inadequate
legal representation.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.202
It's a long shot
but worth a try.

42:49.235 --> 42:51.972
We can't give up.

42:52.005 --> 42:55.776
Just stay alive in there.
Give me time.

42:55.809 --> 42:58.344
I'll do whatever it takes
to fix this.

42:58.378 --> 43:00.413
The appellate process
takes time,

43:00.446 --> 43:02.315
but I trust it.

43:04.284 --> 43:06.687
I'll start on our briefs
tomorrow.

43:16.730 --> 43:18.632
(music playing)

43:43.023 --> 43:44.024
You stinker!
