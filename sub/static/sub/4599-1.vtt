BOSTON
A few years ago

00:40.000 --> 00:43.060
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

00:43.470 --> 00:48.874
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

00:52.079 --> 00:54.343
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

00:54.582 --> 00:59.144
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

01:00.521 --> 01:03.684
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

01:03.858 --> 01:06.053
It put hate in your heart.

01:06.394 --> 01:09.626
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

01:09.798 --> 01:11.026
<i>True guineas.</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:13.725
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

01:16.171 --> 01:20.301
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

01:20.475 --> 01:24.605
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

01:25.248 --> 01:28.081
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

01:28.251 --> 01:32.517
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

01:32.689 --> 01:34.816
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

01:34.991 --> 01:36.891
<i>You have to take it.</i>

01:58.349 --> 02:02.116
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

02:02.287 --> 02:04.778
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

02:06.958 --> 02:11.224
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

02:11.396 --> 02:13.489
You should be proud.

02:25.878 --> 02:28.870
You get your period yet, Carmen?

02:45.532 --> 02:46.999
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

02:48.936 --> 02:52.167
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.705
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

02:56.878 --> 02:59.438
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

02:59.614 --> 03:04.176
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

03:06.521 --> 03:08.045
You do good in school?

03:09.257 --> 03:13.193
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.956
They call that a paradox.

03:17.299 --> 03:21.065
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

03:24.807 --> 03:30.837
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

03:31.013 --> 03:33.710
You know where I am on L Street?

03:33.883 --> 03:35.510
Good.

03:35.685 --> 03:38.210
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

03:40.423 --> 03:44.154
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

03:44.327 --> 03:46.318
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

03:46.496 --> 03:49.624
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.098
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

03:52.269 --> 03:54.829
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

03:55.006 --> 03:58.498
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

03:58.676 --> 04:00.837
A man makes his own way.

04:01.012 --> 04:02.604
No one gives it to you.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.645
You have to take it.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.085
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

04:09.421 --> 04:11.719
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

04:11.890 --> 04:14.586
...tried to tell me what to do.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.526
And something maybe happened to them.

04:19.331 --> 04:22.698
Maybe like that:

04:29.142 --> 04:33.203
Jeez. She fell funny.

04:36.215 --> 04:38.615
Francis, you really should see somebody.

04:38.785 --> 04:42.084
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

04:42.722 --> 04:45.521
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

04:45.692 --> 04:50.220
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

04:50.397 --> 04:53.161
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

04:53.333 --> 04:56.894
When you're facing a loaded gun...

04:58.806 --> 05:01.036
...what's the difference?

05:03.678 --> 05:06.010
<i>That's my boy.</i>

05:06.548 --> 05:09.312
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

05:09.484 --> 05:12.180
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.447
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

05:15.623 --> 05:19.252
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

05:19.427 --> 05:22.295
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

05:22.465 --> 05:25.628
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

05:25.801 --> 05:26.927
Sir, yes, sir!

05:27.103 --> 05:30.539
<i>- tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

05:30.706 --> 05:34.267
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

05:41.818 --> 05:44.343
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

05:44.521 --> 05:48.321
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

05:48.492 --> 05:52.189
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

05:53.663 --> 05:55.153
Pencils.

06:00.972 --> 06:02.200
Begin.

06:09.947 --> 06:11.938
What are you looking at?

06:14.720 --> 06:16.153
Forget it.

06:16.321 --> 06:19.950
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

06:22.828 --> 06:26.229
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.193
They are.

06:28.367 --> 06:31.928
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

06:32.104 --> 06:37.543
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

06:37.710 --> 06:40.543
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

06:40.713 --> 06:41.737
Fuck yourself.

06:41.915 --> 06:44.281
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

06:44.450 --> 06:47.010
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

06:47.187 --> 06:50.453
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

06:50.791 --> 06:54.124
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

06:54.295 --> 06:57.389
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

06:57.565 --> 07:01.331
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

07:01.502 --> 07:06.872
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.976
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

07:09.144 --> 07:12.238
Thank you. You are dismissed.

07:22.824 --> 07:26.453
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

07:26.629 --> 07:30.395
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

07:39.275 --> 07:41.334
School's out.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.048
Thank you, Frank.

07:45.349 --> 07:46.839
You earned it.

07:47.017 --> 07:50.077
No more pencils, no more books.

07:52.789 --> 07:53.778
All right.

07:53.957 --> 07:55.481
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

07:55.659 --> 07:57.559
<i>...this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

07:57.761 --> 07:59.854
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

08:00.030 --> 08:02.727
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

08:02.900 --> 08:04.265
<i>What's the difference?</i>

08:04.435 --> 08:06.835
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

08:07.005 --> 08:10.065
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

08:10.241 --> 08:13.404
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

08:24.423 --> 08:27.324
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

08:27.493 --> 08:30.985
...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

08:31.630 --> 08:34.030
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

08:34.198 --> 08:38.033
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

08:39.938 --> 08:42.703
You're a worker. You rise fast.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.867
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

08:46.446 --> 08:49.074
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

08:49.249 --> 08:51.615
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

08:57.925 --> 09:01.019
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

09:03.831 --> 09:05.822
You can go in there now.

09:12.106 --> 09:13.733
You can sit.

09:19.014 --> 09:20.413
So...

09:21.950 --> 09:24.350
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

09:26.621 --> 09:29.317
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

09:29.524 --> 09:31.185
...and leave it at that, okay?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.852
No idea. Zip. None.

09:34.464 --> 09:37.956
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

09:38.134 --> 09:39.658
We would be cunts.

09:39.836 --> 09:41.861
Are you calling us cunts?

09:42.038 --> 09:44.438
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

09:44.607 --> 09:47.542
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

09:48.144 --> 09:52.172
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

09:52.349 --> 09:54.874
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

09:59.723 --> 10:01.691
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

10:01.892 --> 10:06.158
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

10:06.330 --> 10:10.062
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

10:12.337 --> 10:14.168
That's right.

10:14.672 --> 10:16.731
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.137
Closed casket?

10:20.812 --> 10:22.575
That's right.

10:23.148 --> 10:25.116
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

10:25.283 --> 10:28.412
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.987
- you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

10:35.461 --> 10:36.928
I got a question.

10:37.096 --> 10:39.155
How fucked up are you?

10:50.477 --> 10:52.570
Hi, Darlene.

10:54.781 --> 10:58.979
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

10:59.553 --> 11:03.957
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

11:05.893 --> 11:08.088
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

11:08.262 --> 11:11.390
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

11:11.566 --> 11:14.228
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

11:14.735 --> 11:19.138
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.403
You got any suits,
or do you like...

11:21.577 --> 11:24.410
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

11:26.648 --> 11:29.412
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

11:29.585 --> 11:32.952
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

11:33.121 --> 11:36.147
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

11:36.325 --> 11:39.659
...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

11:39.829 --> 11:41.592
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

11:45.568 --> 11:48.935
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

11:49.105 --> 11:52.666
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.936
This is an elite unit.

11:56.112 --> 12:00.379
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

12:00.551 --> 12:02.610
...organized crime in this city...

12:02.786 --> 12:05.516
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

12:05.689 --> 12:08.453
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.787
And we will do it.

12:10.961 --> 12:14.419
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

12:14.732 --> 12:16.894
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

12:17.068 --> 12:19.127
Jackie met his demise.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.234
Last known photograph.

12:22.841 --> 12:24.866
Costello uses three key guys.

12:25.043 --> 12:28.570
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.443
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

12:31.616 --> 12:33.709
Delahunt, muscle.

12:33.886 --> 12:37.845
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.754
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

12:40.927 --> 12:43.088
...so I can pass them off as my own.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.390
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

12:46.566 --> 12:48.329
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.798
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.940
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.575
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

12:56.743 --> 12:59.211
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

12:59.379 --> 13:03.247
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.318
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.784
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

13:08.956 --> 13:12.825
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

13:12.994 --> 13:15.224
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

13:15.930 --> 13:18.330
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

13:18.499 --> 13:21.764
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

13:21.936 --> 13:24.905
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

13:25.073 --> 13:27.564
...on the weekends. I got that right?

13:28.344 --> 13:31.507
Yup.
You have different accents?

13:32.047 --> 13:34.572
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

13:34.750 --> 13:37.981
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

13:38.153 --> 13:41.122
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

13:41.290 --> 13:44.782
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

13:44.960 --> 13:50.024
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

13:51.034 --> 13:54.526
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

13:54.704 --> 13:57.332
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

13:58.341 --> 14:01.799
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

14:04.915 --> 14:07.145
We have a question.

14:08.319 --> 14:12.983
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

14:13.157 --> 14:14.454
It's an honest question.

14:14.625 --> 14:18.288
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

14:18.462 --> 14:21.090
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

14:21.265 --> 14:24.064
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

14:24.236 --> 14:26.500
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

14:26.705 --> 14:27.763
Hey, he can't help you.

14:27.939 --> 14:29.907
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

14:30.075 --> 14:31.440
...and I know what you're not.

14:31.610 --> 14:35.046
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

14:35.213 --> 14:37.181
You're no fucking cop.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.879
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.888
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.891
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

14:48.061 --> 14:51.656
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

14:52.331 --> 14:54.492
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

14:54.667 --> 14:55.759
Guaran-fucking-teed.

14:58.071 --> 15:02.668
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

15:04.578 --> 15:06.773
You don't have much family.

15:07.247 --> 15:09.442
I don't have any family.

15:14.088 --> 15:18.458
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.561
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

15:21.730 --> 15:25.131
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.134
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

15:29.304 --> 15:34.298
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

15:35.311 --> 15:37.711
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

15:37.880 --> 15:41.907
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

15:42.084 --> 15:44.780
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

15:44.954 --> 15:49.653
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

15:49.825 --> 15:54.593
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

15:58.802 --> 16:01.737
Do you need some money for the funeral?

16:04.174 --> 16:07.769
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

16:08.311 --> 16:13.375
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

16:13.551 --> 16:16.179
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

16:16.354 --> 16:19.585
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

16:19.757 --> 16:23.716
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

16:24.328 --> 16:27.297
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

16:28.299 --> 16:32.031
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

16:32.204 --> 16:34.035
A state-police detective.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.541
And are you a married
state-police detective?

16:37.776 --> 16:39.209
No.

16:40.145 --> 16:42.807
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

16:42.981 --> 16:45.006
I have a co-signer.

16:45.384 --> 16:49.879
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

16:50.056 --> 16:52.354
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

16:53.293 --> 16:54.988
Sure.

16:55.461 --> 17:00.296
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

17:00.466 --> 17:02.991
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

17:03.169 --> 17:06.367
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

17:06.540 --> 17:09.737
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.708
Amen.

17:34.736 --> 17:36.135
So what do I do?

17:36.471 --> 17:40.271
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

17:40.442 --> 17:42.536
...but there's a bonus involved.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.045
Tax-free.

17:46.082 --> 17:50.951
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.851
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

17:55.024 --> 17:56.082
Given your nature.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.262
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

17:59.429 --> 18:01.954
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

18:02.132 --> 18:03.827
...the whole nine yards.

18:05.302 --> 18:08.328
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.863
We need you, pal.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.908
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

18:14.077 --> 18:18.037
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

18:19.751 --> 18:21.548
Do it again.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.381
For me.

18:58.191 --> 19:01.627
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

19:01.795 --> 19:04.696
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

19:04.864 --> 19:08.197
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

19:08.368 --> 19:11.030
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

19:28.055 --> 19:29.887
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

19:30.058 --> 19:32.993
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

19:33.161 --> 19:36.153
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

19:37.199 --> 19:40.498
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

19:40.669 --> 19:42.933
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

19:43.105 --> 19:45.335
Yeah, it was in the papers.

19:47.175 --> 19:48.871
So you know.

19:49.045 --> 19:51.878
And why are we graced
with your presence?

19:52.382 --> 19:54.850
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

19:55.018 --> 19:58.146
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

19:59.756 --> 20:00.950
My mother's dead.

20:02.458 --> 20:05.519
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

20:05.696 --> 20:08.256
I was at a funeral myself, man.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.433
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.864
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.201
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.700
I got, like...

20:21.879 --> 20:25.338
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.281
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

20:28.453 --> 20:31.115
In your line of work, if I gave you...

20:31.289 --> 20:34.986
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

20:36.694 --> 20:38.525
You know what you...

20:38.696 --> 20:41.028
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

20:41.199 --> 20:45.296
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

20:45.471 --> 20:49.373
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.169
What, you want me to say it?

20:54.947 --> 20:57.882
I'm not a cop, all right?

20:58.417 --> 21:02.218
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

21:03.123 --> 21:06.183
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

21:08.862 --> 21:10.921
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

21:11.098 --> 21:14.625
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

21:14.835 --> 21:18.272
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

21:18.439 --> 21:21.533
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

21:21.709 --> 21:24.678
That's right. You used to be a cop.

21:24.879 --> 21:28.280
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

21:28.449 --> 21:31.907
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

21:32.086 --> 21:33.519
This side of Worcester.

21:34.255 --> 21:37.419
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

21:37.593 --> 21:39.584
God says, as far as you're...

21:40.262 --> 21:41.593
...concerned.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.635
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

21:47.803 --> 21:50.169
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

21:50.339 --> 21:53.103
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

21:53.275 --> 21:55.744
Well, I knew his father.

21:56.045 --> 21:58.639
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

21:58.815 --> 22:01.306
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

22:01.484 --> 22:03.452
Fucking guineas.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.120
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

22:07.390 --> 22:09.381
Cranberry juice.

22:11.094 --> 22:12.722
It's a natural diuretic.

22:12.897 --> 22:16.094
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

22:16.901 --> 22:19.199
What, do you got your period?

22:23.407 --> 22:25.841
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

22:28.913 --> 22:32.645
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.711
Do you know me?

22:35.987 --> 22:37.750
No. No.

22:39.257 --> 22:42.124
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

22:42.294 --> 22:44.285
...and there's guys you can't.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.453
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

22:46.631 --> 22:48.896
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.730
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

22:51.904 --> 22:54.930
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

22:57.743 --> 23:00.303
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

23:01.814 --> 23:05.409
I fucking know you. I know your family.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.545
You make one more drug deal...

23:07.721 --> 23:10.554
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

23:11.358 --> 23:14.020
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

23:14.194 --> 23:17.288
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

23:18.966 --> 23:22.197
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

23:24.104 --> 23:25.629
What are you drinking?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.607
A cranberry juice.

23:35.950 --> 23:38.077
What is it, your period?

23:41.122 --> 23:44.354
Get him a cranberry juice.

23:50.899 --> 23:52.924
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

23:54.536 --> 23:56.766
What? "Oh," fucking what?

24:00.577 --> 24:01.908
Get the fuck out of here.

24:02.279 --> 24:03.746
Sorry I'm late.

24:03.913 --> 24:06.848
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

24:07.017 --> 24:08.609
His undercover work is extensive.

24:08.785 --> 24:11.015
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

24:11.187 --> 24:13.417
Okay, my people are out there.

24:13.590 --> 24:16.150
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

24:16.326 --> 24:18.761
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

24:18.929 --> 24:21.762
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

24:21.932 --> 24:24.867
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

24:25.036 --> 24:27.300
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

24:27.471 --> 24:29.735
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

24:30.274 --> 24:31.741
Good. Today, girls...

24:31.909 --> 24:33.809
...what I have is microprocessors.

24:35.012 --> 24:38.312
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

24:38.483 --> 24:41.043
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

24:41.219 --> 24:43.483
These are the kind
they put into computers...

24:43.655 --> 24:46.488
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

24:46.658 --> 24:48.489
...from a couple hundred miles away.

24:48.660 --> 24:51.493
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

24:51.663 --> 24:54.223
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

24:54.399 --> 24:57.335
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

24:57.503 --> 24:59.562
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

24:59.739 --> 25:02.105
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

25:02.275 --> 25:04.436
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

25:04.610 --> 25:06.168
Southie projects.

25:06.346 --> 25:09.008
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

25:09.182 --> 25:12.208
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

25:12.385 --> 25:14.115
...which happens to...
- South Boston?

25:14.288 --> 25:17.348
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

25:17.524 --> 25:20.721
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.623
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

25:25.799 --> 25:27.232
We're here to nail Costello.

25:27.401 --> 25:28.868
All right, look. We got a guy...

25:29.036 --> 25:31.562
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.208
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

25:34.376 --> 25:36.776
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

25:36.945 --> 25:40.381
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.279
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

25:44.753 --> 25:47.051
Maybe. Maybe not.

25:47.222 --> 25:48.918
Maybe fuck yourself.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.423
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

25:51.594 --> 25:53.494
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

25:53.662 --> 25:55.289
You girls have a good day.

25:56.098 --> 25:59.761
Normally he's a very nice guy.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.835
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

26:04.907 --> 26:08.071
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

26:08.245 --> 26:09.974
I knew Myles.

26:10.147 --> 26:12.980
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

26:13.150 --> 26:15.311
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

26:15.485 --> 26:18.477
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

26:18.655 --> 26:21.488
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

26:22.125 --> 26:23.490
Allegedly.

26:24.428 --> 26:25.657
Allegedly.

26:25.830 --> 26:28.298
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

26:28.466 --> 26:30.434
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

26:30.601 --> 26:32.660
He did something else wrong?

26:34.939 --> 26:37.965
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

26:39.811 --> 26:42.006
I mean, fuck yourself.

26:43.649 --> 26:46.117
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

26:46.285 --> 26:49.721
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

26:51.223 --> 26:52.690
I need a cup of coffee.

27:06.439 --> 27:08.703
You making a house call?

27:09.342 --> 27:11.333
Have I seen you professionally?

27:11.511 --> 27:15.003
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

27:15.181 --> 27:18.844
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

27:19.018 --> 27:22.614
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

27:22.790 --> 27:26.624
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

27:26.794 --> 27:28.455
I have an appointment on this floor.

27:28.629 --> 27:32.087
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

27:32.266 --> 27:34.359
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

27:34.535 --> 27:36.628
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

27:36.804 --> 27:39.933
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

27:40.108 --> 27:41.405
Suffolk, nights?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.443
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

27:44.613 --> 27:48.105
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

27:48.283 --> 27:51.047
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

27:51.219 --> 27:53.881
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

27:54.055 --> 27:56.854
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

27:57.026 --> 28:02.123
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

28:02.298 --> 28:04.528
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.726
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

28:07.904 --> 28:09.394
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

28:19.316 --> 28:23.013
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

28:23.186 --> 28:26.019
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

28:26.189 --> 28:29.317
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

28:29.493 --> 28:32.622
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

28:32.797 --> 28:34.094
All right, have a nice day.

28:35.366 --> 28:37.095
Cut him here.

28:37.869 --> 28:39.336
Bye-bye.

28:43.575 --> 28:44.599
Jerk-ass!

28:44.776 --> 28:47.438
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

28:47.612 --> 28:51.140
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

28:51.317 --> 28:54.286
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

28:54.453 --> 28:56.944
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

28:57.122 --> 29:00.148
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

29:00.326 --> 29:01.554
I'm trying to help you.

29:01.727 --> 29:05.163
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

29:05.331 --> 29:08.790
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

29:08.969 --> 29:12.427
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

29:12.606 --> 29:15.439
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

29:15.609 --> 29:18.043
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

29:18.211 --> 29:21.078
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

29:21.247 --> 29:23.477
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

29:23.650 --> 29:25.881
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

29:26.053 --> 29:29.147
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

29:29.323 --> 29:30.847
You fellas come from Providence?

29:31.025 --> 29:33.084
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

29:33.260 --> 29:35.785
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

29:45.641 --> 29:48.804
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

29:49.544 --> 29:50.738
Fuck!

29:50.912 --> 29:54.075
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

29:59.421 --> 30:01.355
Get out of here. Get out of here!

30:07.997 --> 30:11.694
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

30:11.868 --> 30:15.929
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.580
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

30:24.748 --> 30:26.306
Was your meal okay?

30:26.483 --> 30:28.041
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

30:28.218 --> 30:31.619
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

30:37.327 --> 30:39.125
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

30:39.297 --> 30:42.232
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.765
I don't even know what it is.

30:51.076 --> 30:53.874
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

30:54.045 --> 30:55.910
...in your office all day long?

30:56.082 --> 30:58.710
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

31:00.052 --> 31:02.418
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

31:02.588 --> 31:03.987
- No, no, no.
- No?

31:04.156 --> 31:06.488
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.055
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

31:10.229 --> 31:11.628
Yeah, I do.

31:12.198 --> 31:14.963
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

31:15.936 --> 31:18.769
Who says I wanna see you again?

31:22.642 --> 31:24.405
Don't you?

31:26.146 --> 31:28.046
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

31:28.215 --> 31:29.648
Course I wanna see you again.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.376
What Freud said about the Irish is...

31:32.553 --> 31:36.819
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

31:37.792 --> 31:40.124
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

31:40.294 --> 31:43.457
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

31:43.631 --> 31:45.622
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.961
Why do you do it, then?

31:49.170 --> 31:51.298
Some people do get better.

31:54.309 --> 31:55.640
Fair enough.

31:55.811 --> 31:59.508
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

32:00.482 --> 32:01.710
Including the criminals?

32:01.884 --> 32:04.148
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

32:04.920 --> 32:08.048
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

32:09.459 --> 32:12.053
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

32:12.228 --> 32:14.321
I'll arrest you right now.

32:15.532 --> 32:17.432
<i>My word against yours.</i>

32:18.001 --> 32:21.528
- then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

32:22.839 --> 32:24.739
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

32:24.908 --> 32:28.936
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

32:31.615 --> 32:34.015
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

32:36.720 --> 32:38.051
Schuyler.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.034
Do you know who I am?

32:57.275 --> 32:58.799
No.

33:02.815 --> 33:07.149
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.821
His real name Mr. French?

33:22.736 --> 33:24.397
No.

33:28.008 --> 33:29.976
Come with me.

33:34.514 --> 33:38.781
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

33:40.889 --> 33:45.451
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

33:45.627 --> 33:49.495
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.404
Those guys you tuned up...

33:58.574 --> 34:00.735
...they're connected down Providence.

34:02.244 --> 34:03.643
What they're gonna do...

34:03.812 --> 34:07.407
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

34:07.583 --> 34:10.609
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

34:10.786 --> 34:13.186
Unless I stop them.

34:13.455 --> 34:15.424
Do you want me to stop them?

34:18.561 --> 34:20.791
Is this something I can't do personally?

34:24.668 --> 34:26.465
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

34:26.636 --> 34:28.934
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

34:29.105 --> 34:31.835
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

34:32.409 --> 34:33.877
Shoes.

34:40.518 --> 34:42.007
I knew your father.

34:44.155 --> 34:48.319
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

34:49.193 --> 34:52.163
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

34:52.931 --> 34:55.991
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

34:56.168 --> 34:58.898
Yeah, that was his problem.

34:59.538 --> 35:00.903
Who said he had a problem?

35:03.208 --> 35:05.733
I just said he had a fucking problem.

35:07.045 --> 35:09.378
There's a man could've been anything.

35:09.549 --> 35:11.949
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

35:12.118 --> 35:15.554
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.587
- He's clean.
- Arm.

35:17.757 --> 35:19.019
Yeah, come on.

35:19.192 --> 35:20.716
What arm? What fucking arm?

35:20.893 --> 35:24.226
Show me your arm. Flip it.

35:31.038 --> 35:34.565
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

35:36.310 --> 35:37.641
He's clean.

35:37.811 --> 35:41.076
And if I can slander my own
environment...

35:41.248 --> 35:45.048
...it makes me sad, this regression.

35:45.220 --> 35:50.180
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

35:50.358 --> 35:54.658
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

35:55.397 --> 35:57.763
I just can't know.

35:58.233 --> 36:02.431
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

36:03.739 --> 36:06.833
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

36:07.376 --> 36:10.345
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

36:10.513 --> 36:13.346
I am not a fucking cop!

36:14.283 --> 36:19.186
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

36:19.355 --> 36:22.484
Yes. Yes, yes.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.687
All right, all right, all right.

36:25.862 --> 36:28.660
You're okay. You'll be all right.

36:29.199 --> 36:32.066
Get your hand taken care of.

36:33.136 --> 36:37.698
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

36:38.975 --> 36:42.605
As for our problem with Providence...

36:43.448 --> 36:46.246
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

36:48.786 --> 36:51.755
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

36:57.563 --> 36:59.360
Just kidding. How's your mother?

37:00.299 --> 37:01.766
She's on her way out.

37:01.934 --> 37:04.994
We all are. Act accordingly.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.534
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

37:07.706 --> 37:09.867
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

37:10.042 --> 37:13.136
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

37:14.012 --> 37:16.641
Do you trust him?

37:17.283 --> 37:18.511
Well, these days...

37:19.252 --> 37:20.810
...who's reliable?

37:21.354 --> 37:23.322
His Uncle Jackie was.

37:24.023 --> 37:28.483
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.131
I'm reliable.

37:35.936 --> 37:39.372
Arnold, you're one in a million.

37:39.540 --> 37:42.202
Ten. Ten million.

37:44.145 --> 37:46.841
What about your wife, Arnold?

37:49.350 --> 37:50.908
Well, I thought she was.

37:52.387 --> 37:54.184
She wasn't.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.356
Well, she got reliable.

38:00.462 --> 38:03.488
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

38:04.666 --> 38:06.691
Another county heard from.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.597
One too many. She got a big mouth.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.864
Answer this for me, will you?

38:31.695 --> 38:35.256
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

38:35.432 --> 38:39.129
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

38:39.303 --> 38:42.067
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

38:42.239 --> 38:43.706
Thanks.

38:45.676 --> 38:50.205
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

38:50.381 --> 38:52.178
Can I meet you for lunch?

38:52.350 --> 38:53.612
All right, see you then.

38:58.056 --> 38:59.819
Who's the lead detective?

38:59.991 --> 39:02.824
Good. He's a lox.

39:10.970 --> 39:15.066
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

39:15.241 --> 39:16.970
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

39:17.142 --> 39:21.442
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

39:21.614 --> 39:23.810
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

39:25.118 --> 39:27.143
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

39:32.459 --> 39:35.087
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

39:35.262 --> 39:36.559
No wonder you get ahead.

39:42.770 --> 39:44.795
Have a seat, Bill.

39:52.513 --> 39:54.947
Do you know John Lennon?

39:56.050 --> 39:59.111
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

40:01.657 --> 40:03.784
Lennon said:

40:04.526 --> 40:06.221
"I'm an artist.

40:06.395 --> 40:10.798
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

40:15.070 --> 40:16.402
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

40:16.572 --> 40:19.837
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

40:27.317 --> 40:29.615
Smart-mouth.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.453
Too bad.

40:33.656 --> 40:35.955
If you'll indulge me...

40:37.861 --> 40:38.850
Now what?

40:40.397 --> 40:42.331
Choir practice.

40:43.367 --> 40:44.698
Choir practice...

40:49.540 --> 40:51.974
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

40:53.111 --> 40:56.877
...a man could look at anything...

40:57.082 --> 40:58.709
...and make something out of it.

40:58.883 --> 41:00.350
For instance...

41:00.518 --> 41:02.918
...I look at you and I think:

41:03.855 --> 41:06.255
What could I use you for?

41:08.593 --> 41:10.254
Get rid of this.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.919
French.

41:12.098 --> 41:14.566
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

41:14.734 --> 41:16.429
Maybe we could work something out.

41:17.269 --> 41:20.568
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

41:20.740 --> 41:22.708
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

41:22.875 --> 41:25.105
...which hand he jerked off with.

41:25.745 --> 41:27.212
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

41:28.615 --> 41:31.049
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

41:39.159 --> 41:41.923
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

41:42.729 --> 41:44.788
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

41:44.965 --> 41:47.230
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

41:47.402 --> 41:49.802
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

41:49.971 --> 41:52.269
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

41:52.440 --> 41:55.307
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

41:55.476 --> 41:58.411
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

41:58.579 --> 42:00.979
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

42:01.149 --> 42:03.413
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

42:03.584 --> 42:04.573
...you let us know.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.752
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

42:11.660 --> 42:13.423
Jimmy Pappas.

42:13.595 --> 42:15.586
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

42:16.865 --> 42:19.060
Jimmy had a rough month.

42:19.301 --> 42:21.565
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

42:21.737 --> 42:24.935
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

42:25.108 --> 42:26.939
I believe it's been in the papers.

42:28.211 --> 42:30.145
You seem quite happy with that result.

42:31.681 --> 42:33.308
It's a fucking result.

42:33.483 --> 42:36.748
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

42:36.920 --> 42:39.946
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

42:42.359 --> 42:45.192
I think you are a cop, my son.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.524
- Where's your license?
- What license?

42:48.699 --> 42:51.634
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

42:51.802 --> 42:54.930
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

42:55.105 --> 42:58.506
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

42:58.676 --> 43:01.202
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

43:01.379 --> 43:03.313
...into Mr. Costello's area.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.247
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

43:11.423 --> 43:12.447
Hey.

43:14.426 --> 43:15.723
That's Jimmy Bags.

43:19.899 --> 43:22.629
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

43:23.769 --> 43:25.430
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

43:25.605 --> 43:27.402
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

43:27.573 --> 43:29.473
Then make more money.
This is America.

43:29.642 --> 43:32.941
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

43:33.112 --> 43:35.741
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

43:35.916 --> 43:38.009
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

43:38.185 --> 43:40.710
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

43:40.921 --> 43:44.015
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

43:44.191 --> 43:47.058
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

43:47.227 --> 43:51.459
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

43:52.266 --> 43:53.359
Hi, Captain.

43:53.535 --> 43:54.729
This crazy fuck...

43:54.903 --> 43:57.030
...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

43:57.205 --> 43:59.298
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

43:59.474 --> 44:02.307
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

44:02.477 --> 44:03.739
He reached into his coat.

44:03.912 --> 44:06.142
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

44:06.314 --> 44:08.748
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

44:08.917 --> 44:10.976
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

44:11.153 --> 44:13.417
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

44:13.589 --> 44:14.920
...which is the right thing.

44:15.090 --> 44:17.718
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

44:18.227 --> 44:20.127
Bottom line...

44:20.296 --> 44:22.389
...we think we might have a problem.

44:22.565 --> 44:25.432
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

44:27.102 --> 44:29.503
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

44:29.673 --> 44:31.971
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

44:32.142 --> 44:34.736
No, no, not presently.

44:34.911 --> 44:36.344
But I'm working on that.

44:36.513 --> 44:38.640
Here, Bill, this is for you.

44:39.316 --> 44:42.945
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

44:43.119 --> 44:46.611
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

44:46.890 --> 44:49.689
You wait. We'll call you.

44:49.860 --> 44:51.521
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

44:51.696 --> 44:54.631
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

44:54.799 --> 44:56.426
Good.

44:57.935 --> 44:59.800
Hi, Dad.

45:00.504 --> 45:02.768
I got promoted. All right.

45:20.325 --> 45:22.293
Excuse me for one second.

45:23.396 --> 45:25.193
You know...

45:26.466 --> 45:28.832
...if your father were alive...

45:29.002 --> 45:31.061
...and saw you here sitting with me...

45:31.237 --> 45:33.501
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

45:33.673 --> 45:36.471
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

45:36.643 --> 45:38.873
And he could do it...

45:39.479 --> 45:43.348
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

45:48.122 --> 45:52.718
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

45:52.893 --> 45:56.385
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

45:56.563 --> 45:58.861
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

45:59.934 --> 46:01.561
Your Uncle Jackie...

46:01.736 --> 46:06.503
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

46:08.510 --> 46:11.104
And I think about this.

46:17.018 --> 46:19.715
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

46:20.523 --> 46:23.424
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

46:23.592 --> 46:25.617
School?

46:27.630 --> 46:30.360
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

46:30.533 --> 46:32.626
...school is out.

46:33.369 --> 46:36.134
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

46:37.941 --> 46:39.203
Good day, Fathers.

46:40.410 --> 46:43.379
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

46:43.547 --> 46:46.209
You recall our chat?

46:46.516 --> 46:48.609
Little boys...

46:49.052 --> 46:53.216
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

46:53.825 --> 46:56.225
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

46:58.296 --> 47:03.632
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

47:03.801 --> 47:07.828
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

47:10.341 --> 47:13.311
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

47:13.479 --> 47:16.880
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

47:17.683 --> 47:19.844
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

47:20.018 --> 47:21.713
Pay them.

47:22.988 --> 47:26.082
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

47:32.899 --> 47:36.027
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

47:36.202 --> 47:38.568
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

47:38.738 --> 47:40.672
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.400
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

47:43.576 --> 47:46.238
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

47:46.412 --> 47:49.041
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.183
Beeper number.

47:51.886 --> 47:54.184
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

47:55.256 --> 47:57.554
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

48:01.796 --> 48:04.264
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

48:04.431 --> 48:06.559
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

48:07.068 --> 48:10.162
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

48:10.338 --> 48:12.397
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

48:12.574 --> 48:13.836
- It's off?
- You're good.

48:14.009 --> 48:16.671
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

48:16.978 --> 48:19.173
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

48:19.347 --> 48:22.805
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

48:23.985 --> 48:25.977
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

48:26.155 --> 48:27.816
...I need to be made aware of?

48:29.892 --> 48:32.520
I beeped you.

48:32.762 --> 48:35.822
The card they gave me. That's it.

48:35.998 --> 48:39.399
- That's it?
- That's it.

48:42.606 --> 48:44.039
You need to call your mother...

48:44.208 --> 48:46.506
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

48:51.215 --> 48:54.742
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

48:58.021 --> 49:01.355
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

49:01.593 --> 49:05.120
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

49:07.131 --> 49:08.655
So make the call.

49:13.304 --> 49:16.762
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

49:18.176 --> 49:20.839
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

49:37.631 --> 49:42.125
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

49:42.302 --> 49:44.236
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

49:45.772 --> 49:48.707
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

49:49.743 --> 49:52.974
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

49:53.146 --> 49:54.910
Bye.

49:55.116 --> 49:58.313
Everybody out. Move.

50:15.437 --> 50:16.665
Thank you.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.406
So who are you?

50:19.574 --> 50:23.010
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

50:23.178 --> 50:24.839
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

50:25.013 --> 50:28.346
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

50:28.517 --> 50:31.214
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

50:31.387 --> 50:33.480
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

50:33.656 --> 50:37.023
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

50:48.137 --> 50:50.003
The light's nice here in the morning.

50:54.979 --> 50:57.607
So do you wanna talk about last night?

51:04.254 --> 51:07.782
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

51:13.365 --> 51:15.299
It's actually quite common.

51:15.467 --> 51:17.059
I gotta go to work.

51:26.278 --> 51:28.109
Do you lie?

51:29.515 --> 51:32.006
Why? Do you?

51:32.184 --> 51:33.879
No, I'm asking if you lie.

51:34.954 --> 51:37.354
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

51:37.523 --> 51:39.616
Yeah, you lie.

51:39.792 --> 51:40.952
You lie.

51:41.260 --> 51:43.786
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

51:43.964 --> 51:46.023
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

51:46.666 --> 51:51.626
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

51:55.075 --> 51:57.066
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

52:00.948 --> 52:02.677
Did you?

52:02.850 --> 52:04.477
No.

52:06.788 --> 52:08.551
Let's keep it with you.

52:08.723 --> 52:11.317
Talk about how you feel.

52:13.127 --> 52:15.425
<i>How I feel.</i>

52:15.596 --> 52:17.496
<i>How I feel.</i>

52:38.354 --> 52:40.083
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

52:45.361 --> 52:48.296
No. Please. No.

52:48.465 --> 52:50.262
Ain't gonna hurt you.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.101
<i>You sit there...</i>

52:55.272 --> 52:57.502
...with a mass murderer.

52:57.741 --> 52:59.470
A mass murderer.

52:59.643 --> 53:02.840
Your heart rate is jacked.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.643
And your hand...

53:07.318 --> 53:08.717
...steady.

53:11.122 --> 53:15.423
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

53:15.594 --> 53:17.789
...does not shake.

53:18.597 --> 53:20.087
Ever.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.067
Wake the fuck up.

53:33.546 --> 53:35.537
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

53:35.948 --> 53:37.916
How did you know he was a cop?

53:38.084 --> 53:42.885
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

53:43.055 --> 53:45.216
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

53:45.391 --> 53:48.588
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

53:48.761 --> 53:51.993
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

53:52.866 --> 53:54.527
Should I?

53:54.835 --> 53:58.168
So do they all come in here...

53:58.338 --> 54:00.568
...and cry, your cops?

54:01.074 --> 54:04.043
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

54:04.211 --> 54:07.408
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

54:07.582 --> 54:09.709
Use their weapons?

54:10.251 --> 54:11.718
Let me tell you something.

54:11.886 --> 54:14.184
They signed up to use their weapons.

54:14.355 --> 54:16.823
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

54:16.991 --> 54:19.892
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

54:20.061 --> 54:23.087
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

54:23.264 --> 54:25.061
Except for a cop on TV.

54:32.508 --> 54:34.408
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

54:36.045 --> 54:38.104
I see that you have a record of assault.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.804
Yeah.

54:40.082 --> 54:42.107
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

54:42.518 --> 54:46.751
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

54:46.923 --> 54:48.754
Did something happen to you?

54:49.125 --> 54:50.558
No.

54:52.762 --> 54:57.222
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

54:57.400 --> 55:00.801
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

55:00.971 --> 55:03.873
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

55:04.041 --> 55:06.407
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

55:06.577 --> 55:08.169
It's been a year. I've had enough!

55:08.346 --> 55:11.474
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

55:11.649 --> 55:14.777
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

55:14.952 --> 55:17.318
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

55:17.488 --> 55:21.050
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

55:21.226 --> 55:23.251
How about we just erase your file, huh?

55:23.428 --> 55:25.191
How about we erase your file...

55:25.364 --> 55:27.798
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

55:27.966 --> 55:31.197
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

55:31.370 --> 55:34.965
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

55:35.140 --> 55:37.267
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

55:37.442 --> 55:39.673
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

55:39.846 --> 55:45.216
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

55:45.385 --> 55:49.287
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

55:50.056 --> 55:52.149
For chrissake, be smart.

55:52.325 --> 55:55.624
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

55:55.795 --> 55:57.354
Come on, get in the car.

55:57.531 --> 55:59.897
Both of you, get in the car.

56:02.169 --> 56:03.864
When are you gonna take Costello?

56:04.038 --> 56:06.165
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

56:06.340 --> 56:09.639
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

56:09.810 --> 56:11.505
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

56:11.679 --> 56:14.615
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

56:14.783 --> 56:18.480
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

56:18.653 --> 56:20.348
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

56:20.522 --> 56:22.285
Will you shut up?

56:22.457 --> 56:24.823
We are building a case and it takes time.

56:24.993 --> 56:26.221
You know that.

56:27.529 --> 56:29.394
Something's wrong.

56:30.165 --> 56:31.997
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

56:34.003 --> 56:35.595
Yeah, maybe.

56:36.172 --> 56:38.902
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

56:39.342 --> 56:41.071
No bullshit.

56:41.610 --> 56:44.773
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

56:47.683 --> 56:49.207
You serious?

56:49.385 --> 56:51.183
I'm afraid so.

56:55.192 --> 56:57.752
Have you heard anything like that?

56:57.928 --> 56:59.589
Jesus Christ.

57:01.798 --> 57:03.629
Hang tight for me, kid.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.597
Just a little while longer.

57:05.769 --> 57:08.067
We are this close:

57:10.141 --> 57:11.870
All right?

57:13.177 --> 57:14.906
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

57:15.079 --> 57:17.877
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

57:18.449 --> 57:20.974
But now that you're here...

57:21.252 --> 57:23.049
...what do you want?

57:23.454 --> 57:24.887
You want the truth?

57:27.192 --> 57:28.750
Valium.

57:29.094 --> 57:32.222
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

57:32.398 --> 57:35.799
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

57:35.968 --> 57:39.665
...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

57:39.838 --> 57:44.172
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

57:44.344 --> 57:45.936
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

57:46.112 --> 57:47.636
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

57:47.814 --> 57:50.510
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

57:50.683 --> 57:52.514
...and you're gonna close my file?

57:52.685 --> 57:56.314
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

57:56.489 --> 57:59.083
...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

57:59.259 --> 58:03.390
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

58:03.564 --> 58:04.553
...and what do you do?

58:04.732 --> 58:08.793
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

58:09.336 --> 58:11.702
You're fucking ridiculous.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.278
Two pills?

58:22.150 --> 58:24.311
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

58:24.486 --> 58:26.647
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

58:26.822 --> 58:29.814
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

58:29.991 --> 58:32.391
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

58:32.561 --> 58:36.998
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

58:38.366 --> 58:39.994
<i>Fuck.</i>

58:48.711 --> 58:51.373
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

58:51.547 --> 58:53.344
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

58:53.516 --> 58:55.416
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

58:55.585 --> 59:00.683
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

59:00.858 --> 59:03.725
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

59:05.762 --> 59:07.320
What's this?

59:07.798 --> 59:10.631
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

59:10.801 --> 59:12.359
Yeah?

59:12.536 --> 59:14.163
Is it enough to commit suicide?

59:14.739 --> 59:17.230
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

59:17.408 --> 59:19.569
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

59:19.744 --> 59:23.475
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

59:23.648 --> 59:27.277
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

59:27.452 --> 59:28.714
Thank you.

59:29.954 --> 59:32.514
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

59:32.691 --> 59:34.682
- Good.
- Okay.

59:36.328 --> 59:38.421
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

59:45.271 --> 59:48.138
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

59:48.307 --> 59:49.672
Come on in.

59:50.777 --> 59:54.770
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

59:54.948 --> 59:56.540
Yes, those.

59:56.716 --> 01:00:00.447
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.145
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

01:00:03.323 --> 01:00:05.587
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:09.354
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.395
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.626
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

01:00:14.802 --> 01:00:16.167
Our unit will not take action.

01:00:16.804 --> 01:00:20.672
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:23.036
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:27.170
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

01:00:28.016 --> 01:00:30.951
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:33.644
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:36.586
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.090
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.286
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:46.026
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.267
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

01:00:53.443 --> 01:00:55.604
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

01:00:55.778 --> 01:00:58.269
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:01.015
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

01:01:01.317 --> 01:01:04.685
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

01:01:04.855 --> 01:01:07.016
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:13.327
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:15.994
Your mother will be proud.

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:18.031
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

01:01:18.335 --> 01:01:20.826
The readiness is all.

01:01:21.606 --> 01:01:25.474
You know the players. Call the game.

01:01:27.245 --> 01:01:28.405
Thank you.

01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:31.582
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.913
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

01:01:35.086 --> 01:01:37.816
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:40.925
A confessional seal, these days...

01:01:41.093 --> 01:01:42.720
...I'm not so sure.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.430
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.100
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

01:01:53.272 --> 01:01:56.036
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

01:01:58.545 --> 01:02:02.345
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:02:05.552 --> 01:02:06.712
Keep an eye on this one.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.154
All right, here we go.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.127
There's Costello. Mr. French.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.127
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.332
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.377
Time is 10:46.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.506
All right, turn off your cell phones.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:09.676
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

01:03:32.444 --> 01:03:35.470
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

01:03:35.647 --> 01:03:37.547
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

01:03:37.716 --> 01:03:40.446
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:43.679
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

01:03:50.429 --> 01:03:53.057
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

01:03:53.466 --> 01:03:57.095
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

01:04:10.818 --> 01:04:13.343
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:16.654
Government man. Scared.

01:04:17.057 --> 01:04:20.754
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:24.330
...to come to a business transaction...

01:04:24.632 --> 01:04:26.395
...with automatic weapons.

01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:36.210
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

01:04:36.377 --> 01:04:39.005
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.480
Because here, in this country...

01:04:42.918 --> 01:04:45.443
...it don't add inches to your dick.

01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:47.816
You get a life sentence for it.

01:05:03.874 --> 01:05:08.743
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

01:05:08.912 --> 01:05:11.073
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:13.776
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.351
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.987
Then narrow the area.

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:20.715
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

01:05:20.892 --> 01:05:22.792
Why did they turn their phones off?

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.929
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.975
The buyers are there.

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.016
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

01:05:47.185 --> 01:05:48.675
Not to my guy.

01:05:49.221 --> 01:05:51.951
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

01:05:52.325 --> 01:05:53.587
Oh, who the fuck are you?

01:05:54.127 --> 01:05:57.255
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.733
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

01:06:03.903 --> 01:06:08.169
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

01:06:13.314 --> 01:06:16.750
What we generally do, in this country...

01:06:17.318 --> 01:06:19.047
...is one guy...

01:06:19.353 --> 01:06:21.412
...brings the items...

01:06:21.588 --> 01:06:23.886
...and the other guy...

01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:25.488
...pays him.

01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:31.289
No "tickee"...

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.130
...no laundry.

01:06:42.577 --> 01:06:44.670
Go ahead, Fitz.

01:07:00.796 --> 01:07:03.788
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

01:07:05.502 --> 01:07:07.561
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

01:07:07.738 --> 01:07:12.801
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:20.316
They didn't figure we had a navy.

01:07:26.157 --> 01:07:28.387
Did you put a camera in the back?

01:07:30.094 --> 01:07:32.324
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

01:07:34.665 --> 01:07:36.895
You stupid fucking hard-on!

01:07:37.735 --> 01:07:39.259
You fucked this whole thing up!

01:07:39.437 --> 01:07:42.703
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:46.140
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

01:07:46.478 --> 01:07:48.673
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:51.077
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.242
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.445
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

01:07:56.622 --> 01:07:59.251
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

01:07:59.426 --> 01:08:02.259
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:03.896
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

01:08:04.064 --> 01:08:07.124
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.463
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

01:08:10.637 --> 01:08:14.664
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:18.368
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

01:08:18.546 --> 01:08:23.006
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

01:08:23.184 --> 01:08:25.652
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

01:08:25.819 --> 01:08:27.685
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.915
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:34.185
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

01:08:40.202 --> 01:08:43.365
- changing your life radically.

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.938
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:48.133
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:08:51.046 --> 01:08:53.412
How long you been with this guy?

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.877
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.589 --> 01:09:02.786
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:04.483
Do you love him?

01:09:06.662 --> 01:09:09.130
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

01:09:09.298 --> 01:09:10.662
It's very serious.

01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:14.531
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

01:09:15.139 --> 01:09:17.163
No more than I am.

01:09:17.808 --> 01:09:19.799
I know that it's a serious relationship.

01:09:20.444 --> 01:09:22.674
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:25.178
People have doubts and problems.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:29.313
Well, not problems, but doubts.

01:09:32.055 --> 01:09:35.822
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:44.198
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

01:09:44.368 --> 01:09:47.897
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

01:09:48.073 --> 01:09:50.166
Right? We talked about that.

01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:57.682
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.275
Want a French doughnut?

01:10:00.786 --> 01:10:02.253
Yeah.

01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:05.282
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:06.920
Sure.

01:10:09.563 --> 01:10:12.191
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

01:10:12.365 --> 01:10:14.526
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:16.468
Look, I respect who you are...

01:10:16.636 --> 01:10:18.797
...just, you know, not in the living room.

01:10:18.972 --> 01:10:20.564
We might have company.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.731
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:26.878
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:30.745
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

01:10:31.118 --> 01:10:32.107
Yeah?

01:10:33.094 --> 01:10:34.946
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

01:10:35.114 --> 01:10:38.641
Because I believe in public service.

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.788
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

01:10:44.558 --> 01:10:47.026
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

01:10:47.761 --> 01:10:50.321
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.192
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

01:10:52.366 --> 01:10:53.833
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

01:10:54.101 --> 01:10:56.228
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

01:10:56.403 --> 01:10:58.598
You live here now. You're a resident.

01:11:00.575 --> 01:11:02.304
Mayor Sullivan's office.

01:11:02.477 --> 01:11:05.275
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

01:11:05.747 --> 01:11:07.044
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

01:11:07.215 --> 01:11:08.739
What?

01:11:09.217 --> 01:11:11.344
I think it's a guy with...

01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:15.512
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.854
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

01:11:20.696 --> 01:11:22.061
Something for work.

01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:26.099
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

01:11:26.302 --> 01:11:28.566
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

01:11:28.738 --> 01:11:31.366
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.235
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

01:11:33.409 --> 01:11:37.141
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:39.145
...and you're not in jail.

01:11:39.316 --> 01:11:42.717
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:46.617
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

01:11:49.326 --> 01:11:50.691
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:11:50.861 --> 01:11:52.488
So earn it.

01:11:53.363 --> 01:11:55.423
I'm getting the feeling...

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.500
...we got a cop in my crew.

01:11:57.802 --> 01:12:00.202
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

01:12:00.371 --> 01:12:03.169
He's one of yours. Inside.

01:12:03.341 --> 01:12:04.433
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

01:12:04.609 --> 01:12:08.204
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

01:12:08.379 --> 01:12:09.573
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

01:12:09.747 --> 01:12:12.615
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

01:12:12.785 --> 01:12:14.343
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.388
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

01:12:18.557 --> 01:12:22.015
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

01:12:22.194 --> 01:12:24.128
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:28.460
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

01:12:28.634 --> 01:12:31.900
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

01:12:32.072 --> 01:12:35.269
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

01:12:35.442 --> 01:12:39.970
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

01:12:40.146 --> 01:12:41.943
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

01:12:42.115 --> 01:12:44.549
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:46.912
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

01:12:47.087 --> 01:12:48.817
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:52.152
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.625
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

01:12:55.796 --> 01:12:58.287
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

01:13:05.106 --> 01:13:07.473
How are you, Francis?

01:13:12.647 --> 01:13:16.139
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

01:13:16.318 --> 01:13:19.116
And your father called you the tumor.

01:13:19.287 --> 01:13:21.949
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

01:13:22.124 --> 01:13:26.118
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

01:13:26.295 --> 01:13:28.422
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

01:13:28.598 --> 01:13:32.500
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:34.659
You're lying to me.

01:13:36.439 --> 01:13:37.804
Not exactly.

01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:41.432
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

01:13:41.878 --> 01:13:44.575
Microprocessors.

01:13:45.082 --> 01:13:46.310
Oh, yeah.

01:13:46.483 --> 01:13:49.646
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.153
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

01:13:54.858 --> 01:13:57.691
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

01:13:58.362 --> 01:14:01.025
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:05.158
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

01:14:05.537 --> 01:14:10.304
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

01:14:10.475 --> 01:14:12.500
...or your life.

01:14:13.478 --> 01:14:16.470
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

01:14:17.115 --> 01:14:18.845
Okay, then just say that.

01:14:20.933 --> 01:14:22.298
All right, I will.

01:14:22.935 --> 01:14:25.096
Oh, that's the movers.

01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:27.034
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:30.168
- Yes.
- Yeah?

01:14:30.343 --> 01:14:33.972
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

01:14:34.414 --> 01:14:36.383
I'm gonna get you.

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:40.417
If you could've, you would've.

01:14:40.688 --> 01:14:44.249
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:48.794
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

01:14:56.838 --> 01:14:57.827
<i>Frankie.</i>

01:14:58.773 --> 01:15:00.240
<i>Frankie!</i>

01:15:01.109 --> 01:15:03.202
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

01:15:07.982 --> 01:15:09.847
You take off an armored car at the mall.

01:15:10.018 --> 01:15:12.043
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.054
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

01:15:15.224 --> 01:15:19.627
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

01:15:19.795 --> 01:15:22.286
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

01:15:25.735 --> 01:15:27.259
My God, is that French out there?

01:15:27.436 --> 01:15:29.597
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

01:15:29.772 --> 01:15:31.707
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:34.866
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

01:15:35.045 --> 01:15:38.811
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

01:15:39.082 --> 01:15:41.243
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

01:15:41.418 --> 01:15:45.320
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

01:15:46.156 --> 01:15:47.145
Fuck!

01:15:47.324 --> 01:15:50.624
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:54.754
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

01:15:54.932 --> 01:15:57.423
He'll trade you out.

01:15:57.802 --> 01:16:00.498
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:03.765
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:06.934
It fucking hurts!

01:16:14.453 --> 01:16:16.683
Hey. It's me.

01:16:16.855 --> 01:16:19.187
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

01:16:21.393 --> 01:16:24.157
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:28.630
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

01:16:28.802 --> 01:16:31.168
He's a protected fucking informant.

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:35.569
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

01:16:36.743 --> 01:16:39.371
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:46.450
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

01:16:51.525 --> 01:16:53.220
That's my son, Patrick.

01:16:53.527 --> 01:16:56.655
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:56.831 --> 01:17:00.198
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:01.858
No. No, thanks.

01:17:02.037 --> 01:17:05.632
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

01:17:05.807 --> 01:17:07.434
Come on.

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.208
You want some coke?

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.653
There it is.

01:17:52.289 --> 01:17:54.780
Don't move till you're numb.

01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:11.741
Come on. Get inside.

01:18:14.079 --> 01:18:15.910
Boss wants your real name...

01:18:16.615 --> 01:18:19.607
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

01:18:19.785 --> 01:18:21.878
I don't have a bank account.

01:18:22.054 --> 01:18:25.251
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

01:18:25.424 --> 01:18:29.360
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:31.360
Then we wait here.

01:18:32.198 --> 01:18:34.928
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

01:18:46.313 --> 01:18:48.440
Put the forms in there.

01:18:51.953 --> 01:18:54.319
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:57.150
But fuck it, you know?

01:18:57.658 --> 01:19:00.126
No, no, no. Come here.

01:19:05.099 --> 01:19:07.090
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

01:19:07.269 --> 01:19:09.430
That ain't fucking right.

01:19:09.604 --> 01:19:10.866
Are you kidding me?

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:12.336
Look at this. Look.

01:19:13.108 --> 01:19:15.099
"Citizens." Look.

01:19:15.444 --> 01:19:16.775
Billy, he said to stay here.

01:19:17.145 --> 01:19:19.670
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

01:19:19.848 --> 01:19:21.213
Where the fuck are you going?

01:19:21.383 --> 01:19:25.548
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.900
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:19:48.946 --> 01:19:51.005
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

01:19:57.921 --> 01:19:59.786
Look...

01:19:59.957 --> 01:20:01.721
...if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

01:20:01.893 --> 01:20:04.521
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:09.333
So you moving out or you moving in?

01:20:10.101 --> 01:20:12.262
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

01:20:21.447 --> 01:20:23.108
That's me.

01:20:26.185 --> 01:20:27.675
Yeah, I know.

01:20:33.759 --> 01:20:37.456
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:39.230
You have to choose.

01:20:39.399 --> 01:20:42.061
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:45.636
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

01:20:45.806 --> 01:20:48.070
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

01:20:48.241 --> 01:20:50.835
Yes. Otherwise it's...

01:20:51.778 --> 01:20:54.679
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:10.726
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:17.599
Is it real?

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.239
I think so.

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:31.016
You don't have any cats.

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.745
No.

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.486
I like that.

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:48.995
I don't get it.

01:22:51.905 --> 01:22:54.533
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:57.871
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

01:22:58.045 --> 01:23:02.278
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:06.614
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

01:23:06.788 --> 01:23:10.053
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

01:23:10.225 --> 01:23:13.558
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:15.195
I have an immaculate record.

01:23:16.464 --> 01:23:18.329
How is your wedding coming along?

01:23:18.499 --> 01:23:20.934
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:23.870
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

01:23:24.039 --> 01:23:26.166
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

01:23:26.342 --> 01:23:29.243
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

01:23:29.411 --> 01:23:32.073
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

01:23:32.248 --> 01:23:36.309
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

01:23:37.119 --> 01:23:39.554
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.720
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

01:24:30.809 --> 01:24:34.473
Be dirty, be dirty.

01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:38.844
Yeah...

01:24:44.057 --> 01:24:46.787
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.687
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

01:24:50.864 --> 01:24:53.765
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

01:24:53.934 --> 01:24:57.995
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

01:24:58.372 --> 01:25:00.067
You're not cracking up, are you?

01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:03.568
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

01:25:03.744 --> 01:25:05.644
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

01:25:05.813 --> 01:25:08.977
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:11.245
I own the place.

01:25:13.555 --> 01:25:16.149
Why am I not fucking surprised?

01:25:17.492 --> 01:25:21.223
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:23.397
How the fuck do you know that?

01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:25.863
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

01:25:26.034 --> 01:25:29.596
I gotta find myself.

01:25:29.772 --> 01:25:31.364
You're telling me, sonny boy.

01:25:31.974 --> 01:25:34.374
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:38.740
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:40.973
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:45.588
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

01:25:45.756 --> 01:25:47.587
- Right now.
- Collie...

01:25:47.758 --> 01:25:50.158
...laying low is not what I do.

01:25:50.327 --> 01:25:52.989
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

01:25:53.163 --> 01:25:55.393
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

01:25:55.565 --> 01:25:57.157
What good am I if you don't listen?

01:26:02.305 --> 01:26:05.104
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

01:26:05.276 --> 01:26:06.937
He's fucking smart. You know this.

01:26:07.111 --> 01:26:10.706
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.412
Okay.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:22.125
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

01:26:22.294 --> 01:26:26.321
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

01:26:26.498 --> 01:26:30.730
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:34.161
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

01:26:34.339 --> 01:26:39.505
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:42.113
Frank, you gotta trust me.

01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:45.015
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

01:26:46.252 --> 01:26:50.814
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:52.651
Right?

01:26:52.826 --> 01:26:55.454
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

01:26:55.628 --> 01:27:00.259
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

01:27:06.774 --> 01:27:08.332
Christ.

01:27:10.478 --> 01:27:13.003
Who knows what's easy?

01:27:13.781 --> 01:27:18.446
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.667
Shit!

01:28:43.576 --> 01:28:45.009
Fuck.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.650
Hey, how you doing?

01:30:04.828 --> 01:30:06.989
Hi, Darlene, hi.

01:30:11.168 --> 01:30:13.033
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:14.898
Have a good one.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.191
I smell a rat.

01:30:46.839 --> 01:30:48.067
Jesus Christ.

01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:50.733
You got a girlfriend?

01:30:52.679 --> 01:30:54.340
No.

01:30:54.514 --> 01:30:56.573
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

01:30:58.318 --> 01:30:59.683
It depends.

01:31:01.888 --> 01:31:05.517
I'm sure by now you know...

01:31:06.126 --> 01:31:09.254
...I got an informer in my outfit.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.459
Cop.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:16.899
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.232
Jesus Christ.

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.470
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:27.813
It ain't the FBI.

01:31:28.851 --> 01:31:30.785
Ex-wife.

01:31:32.087 --> 01:31:34.146
Old girlfriend.

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:37.458
Or stupid.

01:31:38.627 --> 01:31:41.994
That is what brings you down
in this business.

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:43.859
Stupid, huh?

01:31:44.533 --> 01:31:46.434
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

01:31:50.673 --> 01:31:56.043
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.214
Everybody who works for me.

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:01.980
Right. You know, Frank...

01:32:02.152 --> 01:32:04.246
...I look around at your other guys...

01:32:05.055 --> 01:32:07.990
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

01:32:08.659 --> 01:32:11.822
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

01:32:13.898 --> 01:32:17.061
And all I can answer myself is:

01:32:18.569 --> 01:32:20.594
"What's the difference?"

01:32:21.338 --> 01:32:23.671
Give them up to the Almighty.

01:32:24.209 --> 01:32:26.905
You see, that's my point, you know?

01:32:27.679 --> 01:32:32.173
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:33.681
You accuse me twice...

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.220
...I quit.

01:32:37.823 --> 01:32:42.227
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

01:32:42.395 --> 01:32:45.330
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

01:32:56.475 --> 01:33:00.139
You got something
you wanna ask me?

01:33:02.282 --> 01:33:06.309
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

01:33:07.187 --> 01:33:09.485
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

01:33:09.656 --> 01:33:11.988
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:14.457
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:33:14.628 --> 01:33:18.224
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

01:33:18.399 --> 01:33:20.526
I haven't needed the money...

01:33:20.702 --> 01:33:24.832
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

01:33:25.006 --> 01:33:28.271
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:31.575
But I like it.

01:33:32.747 --> 01:33:35.512
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

01:33:35.684 --> 01:33:38.517
...I got this rat...

01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:42.987
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

01:33:43.158 --> 01:33:45.558
...and it brings up questions.

01:33:45.728 --> 01:33:49.721
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

01:33:50.966 --> 01:33:52.798
Girlfriend...

01:33:54.638 --> 01:33:59.507
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

01:34:00.277 --> 01:34:02.939
Social-security numbers.

01:34:03.113 --> 01:34:06.048
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

01:34:06.216 --> 01:34:09.014
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:11.586
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

01:34:11.756 --> 01:34:13.690
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

01:34:13.858 --> 01:34:17.157
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

01:34:17.328 --> 01:34:18.727
I'm not the fucking rat.

01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:22.162
Start with you agree there is a rat.

01:34:23.067 --> 01:34:24.591
You said there is one, all right?

01:34:24.769 --> 01:34:28.296
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

01:34:28.472 --> 01:34:30.566
Sure. Sure, Will.

01:34:30.742 --> 01:34:35.236
You, William. What would you do?

01:34:40.252 --> 01:34:41.776
Frank, how many of these guys...

01:34:41.954 --> 01:34:44.354
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

01:34:44.523 --> 01:34:47.493
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.629
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

01:34:50.797 --> 01:34:54.324
The question is,
and this is the only question...

01:34:55.168 --> 01:34:59.662
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

01:35:00.606 --> 01:35:03.769
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

01:35:05.045 --> 01:35:08.481
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

01:35:10.985 --> 01:35:13.010
You wanna be me?

01:35:16.724 --> 01:35:19.386
I probably could be you. Yeah.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.050
Yeah, I know that much.

01:35:22.363 --> 01:35:25.424
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.864
I don't wanna be you.

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:33.807
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

01:35:34.309 --> 01:35:35.742
Yeah.

01:35:36.578 --> 01:35:39.046
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

01:35:39.214 --> 01:35:43.311
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

01:35:45.821 --> 01:35:48.688
You know what I like about restaurants?

01:35:48.858 --> 01:35:50.723
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

01:35:51.227 --> 01:35:55.129
You learn a lot watching things eat.

01:35:57.366 --> 01:35:59.699
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:03.503
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

01:36:03.673 --> 01:36:06.836
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

01:36:11.014 --> 01:36:16.247
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

01:36:17.087 --> 01:36:19.352
I got it. Okay?

01:36:21.726 --> 01:36:23.284
Excuse me...

01:36:23.461 --> 01:36:26.123
...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

01:36:26.297 --> 01:36:27.286
...cigarette.

01:36:30.268 --> 01:36:32.600
Eat something.

01:36:41.246 --> 01:36:42.235
Problem?

01:36:42.414 --> 01:36:45.941
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

01:36:46.118 --> 01:36:48.450
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.747
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

01:36:50.923 --> 01:36:54.451
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

01:36:54.627 --> 01:36:58.188
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

01:36:58.364 --> 01:36:59.353
Fucking prick.

01:36:59.766 --> 01:37:02.758
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

01:37:02.936 --> 01:37:05.268
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

01:37:05.605 --> 01:37:08.938
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:12.304
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.841
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

01:37:18.586 --> 01:37:21.487
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

01:37:23.824 --> 01:37:27.089
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:30.026
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

01:37:30.198 --> 01:37:31.426
No.

01:37:33.902 --> 01:37:36.803
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

01:37:37.572 --> 01:37:41.269
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

01:37:41.443 --> 01:37:43.308
...who is here in SIU.

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.446
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

01:37:55.091 --> 01:37:57.719
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

01:37:57.927 --> 01:38:02.159
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

01:38:02.331 --> 01:38:07.133
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:10.563
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:16.741
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

01:38:17.381 --> 01:38:20.316
...if I did it full-time, law school...

01:38:20.918 --> 01:38:23.079
...I'd be through it in a year.

01:38:24.389 --> 01:38:26.289
If I wasn't a trooper.

01:38:30.595 --> 01:38:33.428
But another city. I was thinking that.

01:38:34.666 --> 01:38:36.395
Another city.

01:38:36.634 --> 01:38:38.966
Another city, huh?

01:38:40.471 --> 01:38:43.600
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

01:38:44.143 --> 01:38:47.408
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

01:38:49.748 --> 01:38:51.545
If we're not gonna make it...

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:56.177
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

01:38:57.489 --> 01:39:01.824
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

01:39:10.604 --> 01:39:14.438
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

01:39:32.693 --> 01:39:35.457
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:38.657
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

01:39:38.834 --> 01:39:42.099
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

01:39:42.271 --> 01:39:43.260
Yeah.

01:39:43.438 --> 01:39:47.135
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

01:39:47.776 --> 01:39:50.609
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

01:39:56.552 --> 01:39:58.520
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

01:40:01.090 --> 01:40:03.820
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

01:40:05.595 --> 01:40:07.927
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

01:40:08.097 --> 01:40:10.395
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

01:40:21.912 --> 01:40:25.939
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

01:40:27.685 --> 01:40:32.316
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:36.688
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

01:40:37.462 --> 01:40:40.022
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

01:40:41.032 --> 01:40:43.125
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

01:40:43.301 --> 01:40:45.599
...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

01:40:48.006 --> 01:40:49.634
You're a cop.

01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:51.440
What?

01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:53.737
You ignored us, you're a cop.

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:58.511
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

01:40:59.952 --> 01:41:03.080
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

01:41:03.255 --> 01:41:05.189
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:15.092
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

01:41:15.268 --> 01:41:18.465
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

01:41:18.638 --> 01:41:21.937
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.542
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:26.077
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:29.705
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:33.650
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

01:41:35.523 --> 01:41:37.150
It ain't Bill.

01:41:37.325 --> 01:41:39.088
No way, he says.

01:41:51.607 --> 01:41:53.973
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

01:41:54.143 --> 01:41:55.667
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

01:41:55.844 --> 01:42:00.247
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

01:42:01.284 --> 01:42:02.979
Good. Thank you.

01:42:05.822 --> 01:42:09.758
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

01:42:09.926 --> 01:42:11.826
To find out about the good Catholic life?

01:42:11.995 --> 01:42:15.158
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

01:42:15.331 --> 01:42:19.098
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:21.261
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

01:42:21.439 --> 01:42:24.966
<i>- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

01:42:25.142 --> 01:42:27.872
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

01:42:28.045 --> 01:42:30.343
So just follow him and don't get made.

01:42:33.684 --> 01:42:36.551
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

01:43:13.026 --> 01:43:14.254
Hey. Where are you?

01:43:14.428 --> 01:43:16.396
<i>Look down the car.</i>

01:43:17.798 --> 01:43:20.266
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

01:43:20.434 --> 01:43:22.299
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

01:43:22.803 --> 01:43:24.202
No.

01:43:25.839 --> 01:43:28.672
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:33.640
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

01:43:33.815 --> 01:43:36.079
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

01:44:12.022 --> 01:44:15.219
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

01:44:15.392 --> 01:44:17.917
You got that? 344 Wash.

01:44:22.098 --> 01:44:23.725
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

01:44:28.306 --> 01:44:30.968
Building's empty. No tenants here.

01:44:32.476 --> 01:44:35.775
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

01:44:36.614 --> 01:44:38.104
He's getting spooky, captain.

01:44:38.282 --> 01:44:39.408
- What?
- I just saw him.

01:44:39.584 --> 01:44:42.109
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

01:44:48.694 --> 01:44:51.128
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

01:44:51.763 --> 01:44:54.732
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:58.427
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

01:44:58.604 --> 01:45:00.936
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:10.749
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

01:45:10.917 --> 01:45:12.612
All right, all right. Listen to me.

01:45:12.785 --> 01:45:15.583
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

01:45:15.755 --> 01:45:19.020
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

01:45:20.094 --> 01:45:21.152
Yeah?

01:45:21.328 --> 01:45:24.024
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

01:45:24.198 --> 01:45:26.530
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:28.133
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

01:45:32.172 --> 01:45:33.332
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

01:45:33.507 --> 01:45:35.805
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

01:45:36.276 --> 01:45:38.268
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

01:45:38.446 --> 01:45:41.040
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

01:45:41.216 --> 01:45:42.649
All right, we'll see you there.

01:45:43.184 --> 01:45:44.412
- What?
- You were followed.

01:45:44.586 --> 01:45:46.178
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

01:45:46.354 --> 01:45:47.787
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

01:45:47.956 --> 01:45:50.686
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:53.184
Come on!

01:45:59.835 --> 01:46:02.303
What the fuck is going on?

01:46:03.406 --> 01:46:06.239
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

01:46:07.143 --> 01:46:09.577
Yeah, he must be our guy.

01:46:09.745 --> 01:46:13.044
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

01:46:17.988 --> 01:46:20.821
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

01:46:24.895 --> 01:46:26.692
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

01:46:26.863 --> 01:46:28.694
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

01:46:28.865 --> 01:46:31.892
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:52.081
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

01:46:52.257 --> 01:46:55.283
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

01:46:55.461 --> 01:46:57.554
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

01:46:57.730 --> 01:46:59.755
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

01:47:16.082 --> 01:47:19.074
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

01:47:23.423 --> 01:47:25.448
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.319
What the fuck?

01:47:31.398 --> 01:47:32.387
Fuck.

01:47:32.566 --> 01:47:34.466
What do you mean,
off the building?

01:47:34.635 --> 01:47:37.331
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

01:47:46.047 --> 01:47:47.947
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

01:47:48.116 --> 01:47:50.880
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

01:47:51.486 --> 01:47:52.976
- Where were you?
- What happened?

01:47:53.155 --> 01:47:54.952
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

01:47:55.123 --> 01:47:56.488
What do you mean,
off the roof?

01:47:56.658 --> 01:47:58.319
What's going on? I came to meet you.

01:47:58.493 --> 01:48:00.017
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

01:48:00.195 --> 01:48:03.131
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

01:48:03.299 --> 01:48:05.358
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

01:48:05.535 --> 01:48:07.662
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

01:48:07.837 --> 01:48:09.202
What came off the roof?

01:48:09.372 --> 01:48:10.862
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.803
Fuck this.

01:48:20.884 --> 01:48:22.511
Fitzy! Get in the van!

01:48:24.021 --> 01:48:26.956
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

01:48:27.124 --> 01:48:28.751
All right. I got him.

01:48:35.199 --> 01:48:37.394
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

01:48:37.568 --> 01:48:40.970
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

01:48:41.139 --> 01:48:43.164
<i>Send some back...</i>

01:49:00.526 --> 01:49:03.689
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

01:49:03.863 --> 01:49:05.694
- No.
- Well, a better question...

01:49:05.865 --> 01:49:08.026
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:10.930
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

01:49:11.103 --> 01:49:13.503
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

01:49:14.407 --> 01:49:16.068
Fucking piece of shit!

01:49:16.243 --> 01:49:17.733
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

01:49:17.911 --> 01:49:19.276
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

01:49:19.446 --> 01:49:22.609
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

01:49:22.782 --> 01:49:24.943
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

01:49:25.118 --> 01:49:27.348
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.921
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

01:49:31.091 --> 01:49:32.183
That's a fucking lie.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.921
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

01:49:36.097 --> 01:49:37.689
I need access to those files.

01:49:37.865 --> 01:49:40.891
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

01:49:41.068 --> 01:49:43.195
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

01:49:43.371 --> 01:49:46.169
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:49.207
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

01:49:49.377 --> 01:49:52.313
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

01:49:52.481 --> 01:49:54.847
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

01:49:55.017 --> 01:49:58.418
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

01:49:58.587 --> 01:50:00.054
Good.

01:50:01.890 --> 01:50:03.482
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

01:50:05.427 --> 01:50:07.258
- I need those codes.
- No.

01:50:07.429 --> 01:50:09.557
You want those codes.

01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:14.398
So where the fuck were you?

01:50:16.072 --> 01:50:18.632
Well, boss told me to go home.

01:50:18.808 --> 01:50:23.006
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

01:50:23.179 --> 01:50:24.646
So where the fuck were you?

01:50:25.248 --> 01:50:28.150
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

01:50:28.319 --> 01:50:30.310
When I got the signal, I got the call.

01:50:30.487 --> 01:50:33.513
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

01:50:33.691 --> 01:50:35.750
Billy. Billy.

01:50:42.132 --> 01:50:43.656
Yeah?

01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:47.861
Yeah?

01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.501
You know what I thought today?

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:54.005
What's that?

01:50:55.013 --> 01:50:58.471
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

01:51:01.953 --> 01:51:03.319
Yeah?

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:08.157
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

01:51:10.062 --> 01:51:12.292
When I called you...

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:14.695
...I made a mistake.

01:51:14.867 --> 01:51:18.667
I gave you the wrong address...

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:22.673
...but you showed up at the right one...

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:25.043
...didn't you?

01:51:26.313 --> 01:51:28.873
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:31.481
Tell me why.

01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:57.777
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

01:51:57.946 --> 01:51:59.743
He's dead.

01:51:59.915 --> 01:52:01.542
I'm going home.

01:52:01.717 --> 01:52:04.515
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

01:52:04.686 --> 01:52:06.711
With me it tends to be the other guy.

01:52:06.889 --> 01:52:08.356
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

01:52:08.524 --> 01:52:11.721
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

01:52:11.894 --> 01:52:14.556
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:16.198
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

01:52:16.366 --> 01:52:20.427
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

01:52:20.603 --> 01:52:22.036
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

01:52:22.205 --> 01:52:25.868
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

01:52:26.042 --> 01:52:28.101
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

01:52:28.278 --> 01:52:31.941
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

01:52:33.617 --> 01:52:35.278
Sweetheart.

01:52:35.453 --> 01:52:37.648
You're giving me a hard-on.

01:52:38.255 --> 01:52:39.654
Are you sure it's me?

01:52:40.157 --> 01:52:43.422
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

01:52:43.894 --> 01:52:45.885
Watch your fucking mouth.

01:52:46.063 --> 01:52:48.497
No. You watch it.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.499
Let me straighten you out.

01:52:59.411 --> 01:53:02.278
I tried to call you a few times.

01:53:05.484 --> 01:53:07.247
I know.

01:53:33.647 --> 01:53:37.549
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

01:53:42.689 --> 01:53:44.589
I'm sorry.

01:53:51.065 --> 01:53:52.794
Yeah...

01:53:57.372 --> 01:53:58.999
...I know.

01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:09.132
Yeah.

01:56:09.945 --> 01:56:13.176
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

01:56:13.616 --> 01:56:15.174
Who are you?

01:56:15.418 --> 01:56:17.682
So it is you.

01:56:18.888 --> 01:56:21.880
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

01:56:23.292 --> 01:56:24.919
Who are you?

01:56:25.828 --> 01:56:27.853
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

01:56:28.031 --> 01:56:29.794
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.525
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

01:56:32.703 --> 01:56:34.034
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

01:56:34.204 --> 01:56:37.401
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

01:56:37.574 --> 01:56:39.769
We're all very upset.

01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:43.174
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

01:56:44.147 --> 01:56:47.049
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

01:56:48.519 --> 01:56:49.508
<i>We'll meet...</i>

01:57:28.695 --> 01:57:30.993
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

01:57:31.164 --> 01:57:33.132
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

01:57:33.299 --> 01:57:36.291
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

01:57:36.469 --> 01:57:38.960
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

01:57:39.139 --> 01:57:42.109
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

01:57:42.276 --> 01:57:43.834
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:46.411
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:50.038
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

01:57:50.284 --> 01:57:53.742
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

01:57:53.921 --> 01:57:55.855
Tell me how they found him so fast.

01:57:56.023 --> 01:57:58.652
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

01:57:58.827 --> 01:58:00.988
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

01:58:01.163 --> 01:58:03.290
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

01:58:03.465 --> 01:58:05.695
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

01:58:06.067 --> 01:58:07.364
I'm embarrassed.

01:58:08.036 --> 01:58:10.698
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

01:58:10.872 --> 01:58:15.400
The cops are saying he's a cop...

01:58:15.777 --> 01:58:17.973
...so I won't look for the cop.

01:58:19.248 --> 01:58:20.875
Are you soft, Fitz?

01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:26.010
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:29.124
...you dump him in the marsh.

01:58:30.159 --> 01:58:33.458
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:35.723
...to get a fucking blowjob!

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.661
Don't laugh!

01:58:39.503 --> 01:58:42.404
This ain't reality TV!

01:58:46.343 --> 01:58:48.106
Proceed.

01:59:10.569 --> 01:59:12.036
- What?
- Yeah.

01:59:12.204 --> 01:59:14.968
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:18.701
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

01:59:18.878 --> 01:59:20.004
So get rid of them.

01:59:20.179 --> 01:59:23.273
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

01:59:23.449 --> 01:59:25.679
Get rid of the fucking tail!

01:59:30.624 --> 01:59:32.182
All right.

01:59:38.498 --> 01:59:41.695
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

01:59:41.868 --> 01:59:44.666
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

02:00:00.988 --> 02:00:04.321
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

02:00:04.492 --> 02:00:06.859
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

02:00:07.029 --> 02:00:09.691
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

02:00:09.898 --> 02:00:11.263
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

02:00:11.433 --> 02:00:14.095
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

02:00:14.269 --> 02:00:17.204
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

02:00:17.406 --> 02:00:19.874
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

02:00:20.042 --> 02:00:22.203
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

02:00:22.377 --> 02:00:24.812
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

02:00:24.981 --> 02:00:27.973
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

02:00:48.339 --> 02:00:50.398
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

02:00:50.574 --> 02:00:53.168
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:18.994
Load it.

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:29.311
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.551
Were you not in the fucking car?

02:01:32.718 --> 02:01:35.779
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

02:01:38.992 --> 02:01:40.789
Load.

02:01:48.368 --> 02:01:50.199
Go, go!

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:54.198
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

02:01:56.277 --> 02:01:58.404
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

02:01:58.579 --> 02:02:02.037
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

02:02:11.059 --> 02:02:13.494
Cocksuckers.

02:02:19.501 --> 02:02:22.061
Motherfucking shit!

02:02:25.507 --> 02:02:27.168
Motherfucking!

02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:32.844
Back the fuck up!

02:02:33.016 --> 02:02:35.109
They fucking shot me.

02:02:38.822 --> 02:02:39.948
Get down!

02:02:42.959 --> 02:02:44.517
Come on, fucking bastards!

02:03:03.247 --> 02:03:04.714
Fuck it.

02:03:44.158 --> 02:03:47.924
How the fuck did this happen?

02:03:49.329 --> 02:03:51.923
You're an FBI informant?

02:03:52.099 --> 02:03:54.294
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:03:55.769 --> 02:03:57.464
Grow up.

02:03:58.172 --> 02:04:01.108
Of course I talk to the FBI.

02:04:01.276 --> 02:04:02.766
Do they know who I am?

02:04:04.712 --> 02:04:09.081
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

02:04:10.118 --> 02:04:12.552
Nobody knows nothing.

02:04:14.155 --> 02:04:15.645
Frank.

02:04:15.957 --> 02:04:18.859
Frank. Frank.

02:04:19.028 --> 02:04:21.019
Do they know about me?

02:04:22.731 --> 02:04:25.256
I know about you, Collie.

02:04:25.434 --> 02:04:28.267
You know I'd never give you up.

02:04:29.004 --> 02:04:31.768
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

02:04:32.675 --> 02:04:36.043
To you? Is that what this is about?

02:04:37.013 --> 02:04:41.347
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

02:05:03.374 --> 02:05:05.808
Fucking rat prick!

02:05:27.399 --> 02:05:28.991
<i>Frank?</i>

02:05:29.167 --> 02:05:30.658
Yeah?

02:05:32.405 --> 02:05:33.633
Who's this?

02:05:35.541 --> 02:05:37.168
Gwen?

02:05:38.311 --> 02:05:40.404
Where the hell's Frank?

02:05:41.481 --> 02:05:43.278
Frank got shot.

02:05:46.119 --> 02:05:48.520
Gwen, we lost Frank.

02:05:56.897 --> 02:05:58.524
I got him!

02:05:58.699 --> 02:06:01.133
I got Costello here!

02:06:05.272 --> 02:06:07.764
Hey, good job, sarge.

02:06:08.543 --> 02:06:10.101
No, it's...

02:06:11.513 --> 02:06:13.105
For you.

02:06:14.182 --> 02:06:17.242
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

02:06:20.755 --> 02:06:23.986
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

02:06:24.192 --> 02:06:26.627
How'd you get him without the files?

02:06:26.796 --> 02:06:29.594
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

02:06:30.566 --> 02:06:31.931
You know that guy?

02:06:32.101 --> 02:06:34.968
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

02:06:42.412 --> 02:06:44.073
Good to see you, trooper.

02:06:44.247 --> 02:06:46.909
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

02:06:47.084 --> 02:06:48.642
- Yeah.
- So.

02:06:50.187 --> 02:06:51.950
Now, how long were you undercover?

02:06:52.122 --> 02:06:54.022
Long time.

02:06:54.191 --> 02:06:56.022
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:06:56.426 --> 02:07:01.364
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

02:07:04.202 --> 02:07:07.535
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

02:07:07.705 --> 02:07:09.400
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:07:10.341 --> 02:07:12.707
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

02:07:14.746 --> 02:07:16.543
It's the highest honor we got.

02:07:16.714 --> 02:07:19.513
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

02:07:19.685 --> 02:07:21.676
- That's all.
- All right.

02:07:21.854 --> 02:07:24.755
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

02:07:24.923 --> 02:07:28.518
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

02:07:28.794 --> 02:07:31.763
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

02:07:31.930 --> 02:07:35.889
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

02:07:38.538 --> 02:07:40.836
How's that working for you?

02:07:41.007 --> 02:07:42.736
Is it helpful?

02:07:43.476 --> 02:07:46.240
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

02:07:48.848 --> 02:07:52.079
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

02:07:52.519 --> 02:07:55.216
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

02:07:55.389 --> 02:07:58.552
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

02:07:58.726 --> 02:08:02.560
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

02:08:02.730 --> 02:08:05.324
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

02:08:05.499 --> 02:08:08.059
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

02:08:08.235 --> 02:08:10.396
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

02:08:10.571 --> 02:08:12.972
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

02:08:13.141 --> 02:08:14.540
Fair enough.

02:08:15.143 --> 02:08:19.603
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

02:08:21.783 --> 02:08:22.807
It's my name.

02:08:23.618 --> 02:08:25.984
William Costigan Jr.

02:08:26.154 --> 02:08:29.419
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

02:08:29.991 --> 02:08:31.926
It's your name.

02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:35.429
All right.

02:08:35.598 --> 02:08:38.294
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

02:08:38.468 --> 02:08:40.698
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:43.134
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

02:08:43.306 --> 02:08:47.072
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

02:10:20.409 --> 02:10:24.243
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

02:10:55.211 --> 02:10:56.975
I know.

02:10:58.515 --> 02:11:01.006
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

02:11:01.285 --> 02:11:02.877
I'm not.

02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:08.354
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

02:11:08.525 --> 02:11:10.959
Something I need you to keep.

02:11:11.128 --> 02:11:12.720
For me.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.592
Okay?

02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:24.505
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:28.635
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

02:11:28.813 --> 02:11:31.373
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:34.577
Please.

02:11:38.124 --> 02:11:40.524
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

02:11:40.693 --> 02:11:43.389
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:46.827
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:50.429
There's no one else.

02:11:51.204 --> 02:11:53.934
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

02:11:54.541 --> 02:11:56.509
You know, I have...

02:11:56.677 --> 02:11:59.111
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

02:11:59.279 --> 02:12:01.474
...think about it real hard, all right?

02:12:01.648 --> 02:12:05.175
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:36.884
I was dreaming I was dead.

02:12:38.253 --> 02:12:42.451
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

02:12:43.392 --> 02:12:46.624
- What's this?
- Open it.

02:12:55.472 --> 02:12:58.134
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:12:59.175 --> 02:13:00.642
Really?

02:13:01.311 --> 02:13:02.836
Yeah.

02:13:03.013 --> 02:13:06.574
And they say
that this little speck...

02:13:06.751 --> 02:13:08.946
...is a penis.

02:13:12.223 --> 02:13:14.088
It's a boy.

02:13:14.258 --> 02:13:17.056
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

02:13:18.562 --> 02:13:20.554
Can you still?

02:14:11.118 --> 02:14:13.109
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

02:14:13.287 --> 02:14:17.486
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

02:14:17.659 --> 02:14:21.322
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

02:14:21.496 --> 02:14:24.329
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

02:14:24.499 --> 02:14:29.801
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:33.169
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

02:14:33.342 --> 02:14:35.708
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

02:14:35.878 --> 02:14:39.279
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

02:14:39.448 --> 02:14:43.316
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

02:14:46.989 --> 02:14:48.547
What?

02:14:52.162 --> 02:14:53.652
What?

02:14:55.966 --> 02:14:58.264
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

02:14:58.435 --> 02:15:02.394
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

02:15:02.572 --> 02:15:03.903
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

02:15:04.074 --> 02:15:07.669
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

02:15:07.844 --> 02:15:12.407
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

02:15:12.583 --> 02:15:15.518
Hey, I can explain that!

02:15:20.691 --> 02:15:22.716
Costello recorded everything.

02:15:22.894 --> 02:15:27.457
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

02:15:27.633 --> 02:15:29.123
His lawyer came to me.

02:15:29.301 --> 02:15:31.064
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

02:15:31.236 --> 02:15:33.227
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

02:15:33.906 --> 02:15:37.103
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:40.203
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

02:15:40.379 --> 02:15:42.404
...you two-faced faggot.

02:15:42.714 --> 02:15:46.549
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

02:15:46.719 --> 02:15:48.653
You keep your cell on.

02:16:00.767 --> 02:16:02.531
Open the door.

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:10.533
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

02:16:11.712 --> 02:16:13.873
This is my job.

02:16:39.141 --> 02:16:41.132
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:42.834
Put the fucking gun down!

02:16:43.012 --> 02:16:46.243
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

02:16:46.415 --> 02:16:47.973
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:50.174
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

02:16:50.352 --> 02:16:53.948
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

02:16:54.123 --> 02:16:57.093
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:00.752
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

02:17:00.931 --> 02:17:02.922
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:04.965
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

02:17:05.135 --> 02:17:07.535
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

02:17:07.704 --> 02:17:10.537
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

02:17:10.707 --> 02:17:12.607
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

02:17:12.776 --> 02:17:16.041
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

02:17:16.214 --> 02:17:19.342
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

02:17:19.517 --> 02:17:22.179
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

02:17:22.352 --> 02:17:24.821
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

02:17:24.989 --> 02:17:27.684
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

02:17:27.859 --> 02:17:32.318
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

02:17:32.496 --> 02:17:35.262
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

02:17:38.003 --> 02:17:40.233
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

02:17:40.406 --> 02:17:42.101
I'm still fucking arresting you.

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:44.441
Get up.

02:17:45.611 --> 02:17:48.637
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

02:17:48.814 --> 02:17:51.340
I called you. You specifically. Look:

02:17:51.518 --> 02:17:54.885
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

02:17:55.055 --> 02:17:58.023
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

02:17:58.191 --> 02:18:00.317
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

02:18:00.493 --> 02:18:02.723
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

02:18:02.896 --> 02:18:06.593
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

02:18:06.766 --> 02:18:11.431
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

02:18:13.841 --> 02:18:15.775
Maybe you do.

02:18:15.942 --> 02:18:18.070
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

02:18:18.245 --> 02:18:21.214
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

02:18:21.382 --> 02:18:24.351
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

02:18:24.518 --> 02:18:26.611
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

02:18:26.787 --> 02:18:28.983
I'm taking him downstairs now.

02:18:32.294 --> 02:18:34.125
You know who I am.

02:18:59.254 --> 02:19:01.120
Shut up.

02:19:02.157 --> 02:19:05.184
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

02:19:05.361 --> 02:19:06.556
...you fucking cocksucker.

02:19:06.730 --> 02:19:09.254
This is gonna be fucking fun.

02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:22.709
Just fucking kill me.

02:19:24.315 --> 02:19:26.476
Just fucking kill me.

02:19:28.753 --> 02:19:30.812
I am killing you.

02:20:07.027 --> 02:20:09.757
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

02:20:09.996 --> 02:20:12.294
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

02:20:12.465 --> 02:20:14.160
It's you and me now, you understand?

02:20:14.334 --> 02:20:17.202
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

02:20:30.818 --> 02:20:32.410
Give me that.

02:20:47.836 --> 02:20:51.203
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

02:20:59.415 --> 02:21:01.610
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

02:21:01.784 --> 02:21:06.312
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

02:21:06.489 --> 02:21:08.650
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

02:21:08.825 --> 02:21:11.260
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

02:21:11.428 --> 02:21:13.623
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

02:21:13.797 --> 02:21:16.960
...and discovered that they had expired.

02:21:20.137 --> 02:21:22.401
I just wanna go on record.

02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:27.099
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:40.421
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:43.493
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

02:21:43.662 --> 02:21:46.461
May he rest in peace. Amen.

02:21:46.632 --> 02:21:48.964
May his soul and the souls...

02:21:49.135 --> 02:21:53.970
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.732
Amen.

02:22:25.173 --> 02:22:27.403
Detail. Half left. Face.

02:22:28.776 --> 02:22:30.767
Prepare to fire.

02:22:31.012 --> 02:22:32.639
Fire.

02:22:32.814 --> 02:22:35.305
Prepare to fire. Fire.

02:22:36.217 --> 02:22:39.243
Prepare to fire. Fire.

02:22:39.687 --> 02:22:42.987
Detail. Half right. Face.

02:22:56.405 --> 02:22:58.772
I'll catch up with you guys.

02:23:06.049 --> 02:23:07.880
What about the baby?

02:23:25.603 --> 02:23:27.230
Hi, pup.

02:23:58.771 --> 02:24:00.398
Okay.
