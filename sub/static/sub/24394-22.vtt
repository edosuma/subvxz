a family in Rocinha,

21:05.875 --> 21:09.125
whose grandson had been
killed by the police,

21:09.208 --> 21:11.917
and they said, actually,
they prefer to live under
the traffickers.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.125
Is that common?

21:13.208 --> 21:15.542
(speaking English)

21:28.208 --> 21:30.792
Going into a favela
and killing anybody?

21:30.875 --> 21:33.250
Or killing just traffickers?

21:39.583 --> 21:41.333
So, doesn't that also explain

21:41.417 --> 21:42.667
why pacification didn't work?

21:42.750 --> 21:45.208
If you view the entire
community as the enemy.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.625
Anderson: There are areas
that were barely touched
by the pacification.

22:02.709 --> 22:05.083
In one, on the outskirts
of the city,

22:05.166 --> 22:07.917
armed kids sell crack,
coke, and weed

22:08.000 --> 22:09.750
openly on the streets of
the favela they control.

22:10.709 --> 22:13.375
So, there's two kids
in the far corner who are

22:14.208 --> 22:16.417
10 years old, or less,
selling.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.333

as the end of the world.

the government controlled here?

How did you take it
from the government?

Anderson:
When a militia or drug
traffickers control a favela,

22:55.583 --> 22:58.667
do they do it by
avoiding the police,

22:58.750 --> 23:01.750
or forcing the police
to stay out of a area,

23:01.834 --> 23:03.917

collusion with the police?

that's justified?

Anderson: While not all
police are corrupt,

23:36.291 --> 23:39.500
low public faith in them
means that operations
in favelas are difficult.
