- Go and get your sister back
together--quick, quick, quick.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.297
- Thank you.
- She's in two pieces.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.531
- Bye.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.774
- How are ya?

14:34.774 --> 14:37.110
- What's up man? How you doing?
- What's your name?

14:37.110 --> 14:41.314
- My name's Jon Dorenbos.
- I know--I know that name.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.949
- You a sports guy?
- I am.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.984
You play for
the Philadelphia Eagles.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.919
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm going into--yeah.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.155
So in the offseason,
I tour around

14:49.155 --> 14:50.390
and do magic
and comedy and stuff.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.692
- Oh, wow.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.160
- I was 13 years old

14:54.160 --> 14:55.899
when I saw my first magician.

14:55.899 --> 14:56.162
when I saw my first magician.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.797
He did a sponge ball trick,
where it went in my hand.

14:57.797 --> 14:58.998
I closed my hand.
I opened it up,

14:58.998 --> 15:01.267
and I had a bunch of 'em.
Mind blown.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.535
And it changed
my life forever.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.903
So here's a--here's a paperclip.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.304
You're gonna do me a huge favor.
- Okay.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.039
- All I want you to do
is say "stop."

15:07.039 --> 15:08.508
- Stop.
- Okay, I'm gonna cut the cards.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.276
Whatever this is,
we're not gonna look at it.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.644
This gets folded up,
and it gets placed

15:11.644 --> 15:12.912
in this paperclip right here.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.147
Mel B, this is gonna go
in front of you.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.581
When I was a kid,

15:15.581 --> 15:17.483
I was fascinated
by counting cards.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.818
This isn't 100%,

15:18.818 --> 15:20.620
but hopefully you're gonna
notice a pattern here.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.656
We're gonna shoot one out, and
hopefully it'll look familiar.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.899
Ooh, look. See, there's an ace.
I tell you what.

15:25.899 --> 15:26.025
Ooh, look. See, there's an ace.
I tell you what.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.161
All I need you to do
is pull one out. You got it?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.395
- Yup.
- Show everybody what it is.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.463
Watch, watch.
This is gonna be sick.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.531
It's gonna be a 2.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.867
- Oh.
- Oh, is that bad?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.436
- Ah, no, it's okay.
Watch the 8.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.904
It's a shake.
Watch the 8.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.238
See, it's a shake,
and we can get the 2 out.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.540
See what I mean?
See what we did there?

15:40.540 --> 15:41.674
You know what I'm saying?

15:41.674 --> 15:44.510
- Whoo, okay.
- The number-one trick by

15:44.510 --> 15:46.112
a comedy magician
is pull it out of your--

15:46.112 --> 15:48.548
so look, there's the 3.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.116
Hopefully, we can shoot
one out of the center--oh,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.717
look, there's the 4 right there.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.987
- Oh, my God.
- So Simon, do me a favor.

15:54.987 --> 15:55.899
Think of any card you want to.
Don't name it out loud yet.

15:55.899 --> 15:56.756
Think of any card you want to.
Don't name it out loud yet.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.057
Okay, this is gonna be--this
is gonna be unbelievable.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.292
Got it?
Watch this.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.828
We're gonna shuffle these out.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.729
Simon, name the card
you're thinking of right now.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.531
- 3 of clubs.
- 3 of clubs.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.301
Before we started,
we folded a card,

16:08.301 --> 16:09.836
we put it in a paperclip,
and we didn't look at it.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.808
The card you thought
of--the 3 of clubs,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.777
right there for Simon,
in the paperclip.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.779
Thank you guys very much!
I'm Jon Dorenbos.

16:19.779 --> 16:20.913
Peace out!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.618
Thank you!
- That was crazy.

16:25.618 --> 16:25.899
- That was fun.

16:25.899 --> 16:26.886
- That was fun.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.889

16:29.889 --> 16:32.625

16:32.625 --> 16:36.562
- I love ya.
- How'd it feel?

16:36.562 --> 16:37.997
- It's really cool to come
and rock a theatre

16:37.997 --> 16:39.232
with over 2,000 people.
- Yeah.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.666
- With a deck of cards.
- Yeah.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.435
- That's what I'm
talking about, man.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.804
- Wow.
- That was nuts.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.172
- How did that happen?

16:54.647 --> 16:56.482
- Oh, man.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.551
Welcome to
"America's Got Talent."

16:58.551 --> 17:00.219
So are you guys married?

17:00.219 --> 17:02.321
- We're married.
- Aw.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.923
- Yeah, we've been
together 13 years.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.660
- Are you father and daughter?

17:07.660 --> 17:08.761
- We're husband and wife.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.300
- Aw.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.535
- What are you doing
for us today?

17:15.535 --> 17:18.704
- Today we're going to do dance.

17:20.306 --> 17:20.943
- How do you teach a dog
to dance?

17:20.943 --> 17:22.141
- How do you teach a dog
to dance?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.944
- What got you into dancing
with Carrie?

17:24.944 --> 17:29.448
- My ex-wife
did not dance with me.

17:29.448 --> 17:32.985
- So you divorced your wife
who wouldn't dance with you.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.520
- Yes.
- And then bought a dog

17:34.520 --> 17:36.088
so that the dog--

17:37.089 --> 17:38.591
- Now I get it.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.092
That's why Carrie is
wearing a dress.

counseling--like,

19:54.794 --> 19:56.495
bereavement counseling.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.531
She was just the most
beautiful girl

in bereavement counseling.

insurance covers

23:41.020 --> 23:43.555

23:43.555 --> 23:46.859

seeing a couple of fire eaters,

23:46.859 --> 23:48.427
maybe some sword swallowers.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.162

have danger acts today.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.897
This is an EMT, right?

23:53.132 --> 23:54.900

23:54.900 --> 23:57.036

25:54.887 --> 25:56.155
- Always more dangerous.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.523

about that?

25:58.590 --> 26:01.593

- It's a yes.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.995

28:39.818 --> 28:43.021
- You're gonna see something
extremely dangerous.

28:43.021 --> 28:47.025
It's so big and so dangerous
that we need to go outside.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.694
- Okay.
- So let's go.

28:57.502 --> 28:58.604

30:24.356 --> 30:27.392
- I'll tell you that I was
more terrified than ever.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.760
You got to balance;
you got to know

30:28.760 --> 30:30.662
where you're putting your foot.
It's precise, right?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.764
- Yes.
- As you were coming out,

30:32.764 --> 30:34.166
you stepped on her dress

30:34.166 --> 30:36.015
and accidentally ripped it off
with your foot.

30:36.015 --> 30:36.101
and accidentally ripped it off
with your foot.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.469
- Yes.
- Yes.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.737

was going through my head.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.773

beside his wife

30:41.773 --> 30:43.675

30:45.043 --> 30:46.578
But up there,
I know what I'm doing.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.748

I'm from Hilo, Hawaii.

35:10.208 --> 35:13.478
- Oh, wow.

35:13.478 --> 35:14.479

- Okay.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.348

35:16.348 --> 35:17.008
- Why did you take it on,
at 90 years old,

35:17.008 --> 35:17.949
- Why did you take it on,
at 90 years old,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.818
to come and perform
on "America's Got Talent?"

35:19.818 --> 35:22.721
- Because I started
in show business when I was 17.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.823
- Okay.
- And I never got to be a star.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.458
- So what are you gonna do
for us today?

about all her life

37:04.189 --> 37:07.092
was being a star

mind me asking, how old are you?

49:48.986 --> 49:49.984
- I am 82 years old.
- No, you're not.

49:49.984 --> 49:51.856
- I am 82 years old.
- No, you're not.

49:53.891 --> 49:55.559
Before you retired,
what was your job?

49:55.559 --> 49:58.529
- The most recent one
was aerospace engineering.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.064
I was a--

50:00.064 --> 50:01.365
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

50:01.365 --> 50:02.867
- Yes, I was blessed

50:02.867 --> 50:04.468
to be the program manager

50:04.468 --> 50:06.637
for the Coast Guard instrument

50:06.637 --> 50:09.039
that repaired the Hubble
Space Telescope.

1:00:31.595 --> 1:00:33.763
I would want one million Legos.

1:00:38.568 --> 1:00:42.305

I might be only six,

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:46.409
but I think I know a thing
or two about girls.

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:52.182
An important thing to know
about girls

1:00:52.182 --> 1:00:56.987
is that they say one thing,
but always mean another.

1:00:56.987 --> 1:00:58.855
- That's true.

1:00:58.855 --> 1:01:00.690
- My mom, for instance,

1:01:00.690 --> 1:01:03.860
she always tells me
to call her Mom.

1:01:03.860 --> 1:01:04.071
And I come find out,
that's not even her real name!

1:01:04.071 --> 1:01:08.865
And I come find out,
that's not even her real name!

1:01:10.467 --> 1:01:12.102
What?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:20.977

- Do you realize how funny
you are, Nathan?

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:26.116
- No.
- Who writes the material?

1:01:26.116 --> 1:01:29.286
- Well, Mom, she types them.

1:01:29.286 --> 1:01:32.255
I come up with the jokes.

1:01:32.255 --> 1:01:34.071
- That's amazing.

1:01:34.071 --> 1:01:34.624
- That's amazing.

1:01:34.624 --> 1:01:36.960
He is one step closer
to a million Legos. It's a yes.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:39.963
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1:01:39.963 --> 1:01:42.365
- You have four yeses.

1:01:47.604 --> 1:01:49.539
- You did so good!

1:01:49.539 --> 1:01:52.342
- Ooh, look what I've got.
It's coming.

1:01:52.342 --> 1:01:53.476

1:01:53.476 --> 1:01:55.011
- Uh-huh.
- Why do you wake up so early?

1:01:55.011 --> 1:01:56.513
Little ones.
- Because I have four kids.

1:01:56.513 --> 1:01:58.081
- You don't want
to be friends with boys.

1:01:58.081 --> 1:02:00.517
- I think boys are better.
- No, we're better.

1:02:00.517 --> 1:02:03.353
- I think boys are better.
- Whatever.

1:02:03.353 --> 1:02:04.071

1:02:15.699 --> 1:02:16.700
- Nice to meet you.
This is my mother.

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:18.101
- Hi. Michelle.
- I love my mom,

1:02:18.101 --> 1:02:21.671
but she makes it a little bit
difficult to meet girls.

1:02:21.671 --> 1:02:23.073
You guys are really--

1:02:23.073 --> 1:02:24.941

Did it help you with girls?

1:02:44.561 --> 1:02:46.930
- Did being homeschooled
help me with girls?

1:02:46.930 --> 1:02:50.834
- Yeah.
- Uh, not exactly, no.

1:02:50.834 --> 1:02:54.271

1:08:15.825 --> 1:08:17.226
Do you guys remember
"The Little Mermaid,"

1:08:17.226 --> 1:08:19.596
the one where Ariel trades
her voice for legs,

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:21.564
and the prince finds her naked
on a beach,

1:08:21.564 --> 1:08:22.765
and she can't talk.

1:08:22.765 --> 1:08:24.400
And he falls in love with her?

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:26.069
Pretty sure he doesn't know
anything about her.

1:08:26.069 --> 1:08:29.138
All he knows is she's got
whosits and whatsits galore.

1:08:33.276 --> 1:08:35.144
- Why "America's Got Talent?"

1:08:35.144 --> 1:08:36.579
- I want to show people

1:08:36.579 --> 1:08:38.054

got grey hair, right?

1:08:38.054 --> 1:08:40.116
that you don't stop because you
got grey hair, right?

1:08:41.651 --> 1:08:44.754
So I am old.
I'm in the autumn of my years.

1:08:44.754 --> 1:08:47.924
It is, 'cause my foliage
is starting to change color.

1:08:50.226 --> 1:08:54.897
- No-ho-ho.
No, no, no.

1:08:54.897 --> 1:08:56.299
- If you know what I mean.

1:08:56.299 --> 1:08:58.201
- Oh, we know.

1:08:58.201 --> 1:09:00.470
- So I--in addition
to being old,

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:02.038
I'm fat, single, and broke.

1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:06.242
I'm a complete
and utter physical wreck.

1:09:06.242 --> 1:09:08.054
I smoke two packs
of cigarettes a day.

1:09:08.054 --> 1:09:08.511
I smoke two packs
of cigarettes a day.

1:09:08.511 --> 1:09:10.647

1:09:10.647 --> 1:09:12.215
I'm starting

1:09:12.215 --> 1:09:14.317

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:38.054
- Well, for the first
28 years of my life,

1:09:38.054 --> 1:09:39.642
- Well, for the first
28 years of my life,

1:09:39.642 --> 1:09:41.711

1:09:41.711 --> 1:09:43.813
- Oh, no way.
- I love it.

1:09:43.813 --> 1:09:47.083

you're completely inappropriate,

- Thank you.
- And you're my kind of girl.

1:09:50.787 --> 1:09:51.788
- Thank you.
- I loved it.

1:09:51.788 --> 1:09:53.189
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

1:09:53.189 --> 1:09:54.757
- And you're talented.
- Thank you.

1:09:54.757 --> 1:09:56.359

1:09:56.359 --> 1:09:58.494
and I'm so glad
we got to see ya.

1:09:58.494 --> 1:10:00.763
- Obviously, sweetie,
it's a yes.

1:10:02.298 --> 1:10:04.600
- Whoo!

1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:06.936
- Oh, wow.

1:10:06.936 --> 1:10:08.054
"America's Got Talent"--this
is amazing.

1:10:08.054 --> 1:10:10.039
"America's Got Talent"--this
is amazing.

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:12.275
I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.

1:10:12.275 --> 1:10:15.945
I even turned down
a really big job to be here.

1:10:15.945 --> 1:10:19.215
Yeah, have you ever
seen Disney Channel?

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:21.617
Well, I was gonna babysit
two little girls

1:10:21.617 --> 1:10:23.319
that really like Disney Channel.

1:10:25.421 --> 1:10:26.723
- That's funny.
- Let's talk about that

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:29.459
for a minute.
I am not a high school graduate.

1:10:29.459 --> 1:10:30.927
I haven't even been
to high school.

1:10:30.927 --> 1:10:32.295
I don't have a driver's license.

1:10:32.295 --> 1:10:34.097
I can't even sit
in the front seat.

1:10:34.097 --> 1:10:36.766
I'm still on safety scissors,
people.

1:10:40.136 --> 1:10:45.875
But you are going to leave
your beloved child--the one

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:50.780
who is carrying on your name
to the next generation--with me.

1:10:55.384 --> 1:11:00.289
My only qualification
to be a babysitter

1:11:00.289 --> 1:11:04.293
is that I used to be a baby.

1:11:06.596 --> 1:11:08.054
I mean, that's crazy.
That's like saying,

1:11:08.054 --> 1:11:09.799
I mean, that's crazy.
That's like saying,

1:11:09.799 --> 1:11:13.035
"Hey, weren't you
the host of a reality show?

1:11:13.035 --> 1:11:16.072
You want to be President
of the United States?"

1:11:19.008 --> 1:11:21.310
Thank you, everyone.

1:11:27.350 --> 1:11:29.252
- There you go, Mom and Dad!
- Yeah!

1:11:30.453 --> 1:11:31.854
- You know what, Lori?

1:11:31.854 --> 1:11:34.524
You're really, really funny.

1:11:34.524 --> 1:11:36.025
- Thank you.

1:11:36.025 --> 1:11:38.054
- You could be maybe
the next Tina Fey

1:11:38.054 --> 1:11:38.294
- You could be maybe
the next Tina Fey

1:11:38.294 --> 1:11:39.529
or someone, Lori, you know?

1:11:39.529 --> 1:11:42.765
- Thank you.
- You know what?

1:11:42.765 --> 1:11:44.867
I'm just gonna put it
in a nutshell.

1:11:44.867 --> 1:11:46.636
You've just got it.

1:11:46.636 --> 1:11:48.104
You've got that special it.

1:11:48.104 --> 1:11:49.906
- Thank you.
- Four yeses.

1:11:55.411 --> 1:11:58.047
- You work hard.
I'm so proud of you.

1:11:58.047 --> 1:12:00.149
That was amazing.

1:12:01.851 --> 1:12:04.053
- Hi. What's your name,
and where are you from?

1:12:04.053 --> 1:12:08.054
- My name is D. J. Demers,
and I'm from Canada.

1:12:08.054 --> 1:12:08.391
- My name is D. J. Demers,
and I'm from Canada.

1:12:08.391 --> 1:12:10.860
- D. J. from Canada.

1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:13.296
And how old are you,
D. J. from Canada?

1:12:13.296 --> 1:12:14.730
- I do standup comedy.

1:12:14.730 --> 1:12:17.300
- No, how old are you?
- Well, I am 30,

1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:19.569
so that was not the correct
answer at all to your question.

1:12:19.569 --> 1:12:22.171
But then, I also wear
hearing aids,

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:23.639
so that's why
I didn't hear you right, yeah.

1:12:23.639 --> 1:12:25.208
- Oh, you do? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:12:26.609 --> 1:12:29.345
I've always wanted
to be a comedian.

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:32.748
And I always remember,
as a kid, having a joke ready.

1:12:32.748 --> 1:12:35.384
But I knew very early on,
it would be a challenge.

1:12:35.384 --> 1:12:38.054
I have a very profound
hearing loss.

1:12:38.054 --> 1:12:38.054
My parents discovered it
when I was four years old.

1:12:38.054 --> 1:12:41.123
My parents discovered it
when I was four years old.

1:12:41.123 --> 1:12:44.060
They realized I wasn't
responding to things.

1:12:44.060 --> 1:12:46.295
So they took me to a doctor,

1:12:46.295 --> 1:12:48.497
and I've been wearing
hearing aids since that day.

1:12:51.334 --> 1:12:53.703
Me and my partner
actually recently broke up.

1:12:55.404 --> 1:12:57.240
Thank you. Thanks.

1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:01.010
Um, but--

1:13:01.010 --> 1:13:03.346
It got really quiet
in here for a second.

1:13:03.346 --> 1:13:06.616
Or did it?
No, it did. I heard that.

1:13:06.616 --> 1:13:08.054
No, I know why it got
quiet though, right?

1:13:08.054 --> 1:13:08.584
No, I know why it got
quiet though, right?

1:13:08.584 --> 1:13:10.753
It's 'cause I said "partner."

1:13:10.753 --> 1:13:12.955
As soon as somebody says
"partner,"

1:13:12.955 --> 1:13:17.059
and you don't know them well,

1:13:17.059 --> 1:13:19.428
you can't even focus
on the rest of the conversation.

1:13:19.428 --> 1:13:21.197
You just...

1:13:21.197 --> 1:13:22.765
You're just trying
to solve the mystery.

1:13:22.765 --> 1:13:27.570
You're, "Hmm, partner, huh?"

1:13:27.570 --> 1:13:29.939
You're all looking at me trying
to crack the case right now.

1:13:29.939 --> 1:13:31.774
I can feel it.

1:13:31.774 --> 1:13:33.209
- Yes, we are.

1:13:33.209 --> 1:13:35.077
- You're like, "Well,

1:13:35.077 --> 1:13:36.245
"he's kind of got a lisp,

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:37.747
"but that could be
the hearing impairment.

1:13:37.747 --> 1:13:38.054
"I don't know--

1:13:38.054 --> 1:13:42.385
"I don't know--

1:13:42.385 --> 1:13:44.854
don't know
what to attribute that to."

1:13:46.322 --> 1:13:49.525
No, um, me
and my girlfriend broke up,

1:13:49.525 --> 1:13:51.227
to clear up that mystery.

1:13:51.227 --> 1:13:53.296
Thank you.

1:13:53.296 --> 1:13:55.364
'Cause I realized I was gay.

1:13:55.364 --> 1:13:59.302
But--thank you very much, guys.

1:13:59.302 --> 1:14:00.503
Thank you.

1:14:02.772 --> 1:14:05.641
Thank you.

1:14:05.641 --> 1:14:08.054
- You know something?
You are far beyond your years

1:14:08.054 --> 1:14:08.177
- You know something?
You are far beyond your years

1:14:08.177 --> 1:14:10.012
in the ability
and your comfort level.

1:14:10.012 --> 1:14:12.982
You've found the humor
in the reality of who you are

1:14:12.982 --> 1:14:14.817
and what you're doing,
what we're thinking.

1:14:14.817 --> 1:14:18.187
And up till now, this season,
as far as comedy goes,

1:14:18.187 --> 1:14:19.355
you're my favorite.

1:14:19.355 --> 1:14:20.623
- That means so much coming
from you, Howie.

1:14:20.623 --> 1:14:21.891

That was a right belly laugh.

1:15:36.499 --> 1:15:38.334
on the southwest side
of Chicago.

1:15:38.334 --> 1:15:39.769
It's a very rough neighborhood.

1:15:39.769 --> 1:15:41.103
You guys believe in yourselves?

1:15:41.103 --> 1:15:42.505

1:18:13.222 --> 1:18:16.659
- Last summer,
we were on vacation,

1:18:16.659 --> 1:18:17.083
and my mom noticed
a lump in my stomach.

1:18:17.083 --> 1:18:20.062
and my mom noticed
a lump in my stomach.

1:18:20.062 --> 1:18:23.465
- We took her in to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

1:18:23.465 --> 1:18:25.701
"Your child has cancer."

1:18:25.701 --> 1:18:28.837
It's probably the worst--the
worst things

1:18:28.837 --> 1:18:30.973

end of Louisville--pretty

1:19:08.544 --> 1:19:10.145
rough neighborhood.

1:19:10.145 --> 1:19:12.848
But we are like brothers,
and we look out for each other.

1:19:12.848 --> 1:19:14.283

1:19:14.283 --> 1:19:16.252
we was gonna change
the world, man.

1:19:21.890 --> 1:19:23.192
