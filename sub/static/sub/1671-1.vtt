00:37.640 --> 00:38.801
<i>Start talking.</i>

00:39.040 --> 00:40.640
<i>I'm not sure if we're on the air.</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:42.689
<i>This is a series of explosions...</i>

00:42.920 --> 00:44.763
<i>We're being told...</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:45.683
<i>...this is a major incident.</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:47.763
<i>The emergency is a major incident.</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:49.695
<i>...bright lights and an orange glow.</i>

00:49.720 --> 00:51.529
<i>That was the moment the meteor hit.</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:52.880
<i>It does now appear...</i>

00:53.040 --> 00:54.610
<i>...to be a major attack.</i>

00:54.840 --> 00:56.840
<i>Since they landed
outside Hamburg five years ago...</i>

00:56.960 --> 00:58.280
<i>...they have steadily advanced...</i>

00:58.480 --> 01:00.721
<i>...across Europe.
We've suffered millions of casualties.</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:05.045
<i>The evacuation of key
government officials continuing.</i>

01:05.280 --> 01:06.920
<i>Nothing has stopped their advance.</i>

01:07.120 --> 01:09.401
<i>In human costs,
the Europeans have paid the highest price.</i>

01:09.440 --> 01:12.683
<i>They have the ability to mimic
and even anticipate our actions.</i>

01:12.960 --> 01:13.768
<i>If we do not defeat them...</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:14.762
<i>...in France...</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:16.161
<i>...we'll be fighting them in London...</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:17.970
<i>...then New York, then Tokyo.</i>

01:19.440 --> 01:20.930
<i>All of humanity's at stake.</i>

01:21.160 --> 01:21.920
<i>After five years...</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:23.411
<i>...we finally have a victory.</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:24.840
<i>These pictures are just in...</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:26.001
<i>...from Verdun.</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:28.480
<i>One of the striking things
was how low casualties were...</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:30.090
<i>...and how little damage...</i>

01:30.360 --> 01:32.360
<i>We have seen a stunning victory here today.</i>

01:33.320 --> 01:35.687
<i>How do you convince people that this</i> is...

01:35.920 --> 01:37.445
<i>...a fight that can be won?</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:39.523
<i>This is an alien invasion
in a global war.</i>

01:39.760 --> 01:42.161
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

01:42.400 --> 01:44.289
<i>...we've been able
to create super-soldiers.</i>

01:45.200 --> 01:47.362
<i>Look at Rita Vrataski,
the Angel of Verdun.</i>

01:47.600 --> 01:50.080
<i>They're calling her the Angel of Verdun.</i>

01:50.320 --> 01:52.561
<i>She is seen as the new hope for this war.</i>

01:52.840 --> 01:54.046
<i>It's extraordinary.</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:56.487
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

01:56.760 --> 01:58.762
<i>...Rita Vrataski was able to kill...</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:00.809
<i>...hundreds of mimics on only her first day.</i>

02:01.040 --> 02:03.042
<i>Is the tide of this war changing?</i>

02:03.280 --> 02:06.489
<i>The Army attribute this success
to a revolutionary new technology:</i>

02:06.720 --> 02:08.245
<i>The Exosuit jacket.</i>

02:10.759 --> 02:14.048
<i>She was able to kill hundreds of mimics
on only her first day in combat.</i>

02:14.320 --> 02:16.687
<i>Imagine an army of Rita Vrataskis.</i>

02:16.920 --> 02:17.807
<i>We're holding them...</i>

02:18.040 --> 02:20.646
<i>...back at the English Channel,
but for how long?</i>

02:20.880 --> 02:24.248
<i>This is dangerous talk.
People are suspicious about this invasion.</i>

02:24.480 --> 02:25.811
<i>Over 17 nations have joined
the United Defense Force...</i>

02:26.080 --> 02:27.570
<i>...which hopes to push them back.</i>

02:27.800 --> 02:29.211
<i>We've got them contained.</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:32.250
<i>And with this new technology,
we're gonna defeat them.</i>

02:32.480 --> 02:36.246
<i>Operation Downfall is going to be
the largest mechanized invasion in history.</i>

02:36.480 --> 02:40.007
<i>We will be victorious.
We fight. That's what we do.</i>

03:36.040 --> 03:39.567
Major William Cage,
United States Military Media.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.131
Welcome to London, major.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.489
The general will see you now.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.721
Thank you.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.283
<i>Operation Downfall.</i>

03:56.520 --> 04:00.491
The entire UDF, invading from France,
the Mediterranean, Scandinavia...

04:00.760 --> 04:02.569
...relieving pressure on the eastern front...

04:02.840 --> 04:05.200
...allowing the Russians and Chinese
to push the enemy back.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.765
We all meet in the middle...

04:07.000 --> 04:10.083
...exterminating this mimic scourge
along the way.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.201
A lot of good soldiers
are gonna die tomorrow, major.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.845
When all the smoke clears...

04:15.080 --> 04:17.481
...and the body bags start coming home,
people look for someone to blame...

04:17.720 --> 04:19.370
...someone like me.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.079
Ideally, I'd prefer a different scenario.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.403
Please.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.366
A best-selling memoir, perhaps.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.445
Maybe a career in politics?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.042
Off the top of my head,
I would go with...

04:35.280 --> 04:37.123
...the sense of manifest destiny.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.408
Rags to riches.
Rapid rise through the ranks.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.486
Born to deliver us. And the people,
well, they love that sort of thing.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.287
You misunderstand. I didn't ask you here
to sell me. Sell the invasion.

04:48.040 --> 04:48.962
Okay.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.409
You ship for the coast in one hour.
Your camera crew is standing by.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.603
You'll be on the beach
with the first wave.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.971
I'm sorry, the first wave? The beach?
You mean the front?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.201
France.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.406
Satellites show minimal
enemy movement on the coast.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.971
Little resistance.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.969
A little excitement,
something to tell your grandchildren.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.446
While I appreciate...

05:10.680 --> 05:12.409
...the confidence, general...

05:12.640 --> 05:14.722
...I do this to avoid doing that.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.764
I was in ROTC in college.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.442
The war broke out,
I lost my advertising firm...

05:25.120 --> 05:26.121
...and here I am.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.170
You know, I do what I do,
and you do what you do.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.601
But...

05:31.840 --> 05:35.083
...I'm not a soldier, really.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.361
No, of course you're not.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.246
I'm embedding you with several
hundred thousand who are.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.204
While it is an honor,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.484
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Not so much as a paper out.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.607
But...

05:55.840 --> 05:58.320
...sitting here thinking about this...

05:58.560 --> 06:00.528
...a couple of names come to mind...

06:00.760 --> 06:03.684
...that I feel I could recommend to you.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.008
It's not an offer, major. It's an order.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.726
General, I am an officer
in the United States military.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.804
- You don't even have the authority.
- I have spoken to your CO.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.691
You are now under my command.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.806
You will retain your present rank...

06:19.040 --> 06:20.644
...of course.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.211
My secretary has all the details.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.650
Do a good job, major.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.247
Good luck. You are dismissed.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.246
General?

06:47.960 --> 06:51.965
I just inspired millions of people
to join your army.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.603
And when the body bags come home
and they're looking...

06:57.840 --> 07:01.322
...for someone to blame,
how hard do you think it would be...

07:01.600 --> 07:04.683
...for me to convince people
to blame you?

07:06.080 --> 07:06.763
I'd imagine...

07:07.000 --> 07:09.685
...the general would prefer to avoid that.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.965
Are you blackmailing me, major?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.810
I would prefer...

07:18.360 --> 07:22.365
...not to be filming acts of heroism
and valor on that beach tomorrow.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.411
You won't be.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.048
I'm glad we could, work this out.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.009
Now if you'll excuse me, general. I...

07:49.160 --> 07:50.047
Thank you.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.166
Arrest this man.

07:54.480 --> 07:55.288
What?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.000
Hey! Hey!

07:59.200 --> 08:00.690
Stop right there!

08:01.560 --> 08:02.288
Hey! Stop!

08:02.520 --> 08:03.851
Get out of the way!

08:04.120 --> 08:04.803
Out of the way!

08:05.080 --> 08:05.840
Hold it!

08:16.920 --> 08:18.445
Left flank, march!

08:18.720 --> 08:20.245
Forward, march!

08:21.520 --> 08:23.170
About-turn!

08:30.320 --> 08:32.448
<i>Supplies closing in 10 minutes.</i>

08:48.760 --> 08:49.443
On your feet...

08:49.680 --> 08:50.329
...maggot!

08:53.560 --> 08:54.368
That is no way...

08:54.600 --> 08:56.329
...to address an officer, sergeant.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.609
It's how I address a slack-jawed recruit
before I bust his hole...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.285
...with my boot heel, maggot.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.085
Hold up there, sergeant.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.165
Can I help you, sir?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.165
Where the hell am I, sergeant?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.010
Forward Operating Base Heathrow.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.446
You just came in with...

09:12.680 --> 09:15.126
- ...the fresh recruits.
- Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.801
No, sir, you do not.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.326
My name is Major William Cage.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.210
- I'm an American officer.
- Officer?

09:21.440 --> 09:22.885
This is processing.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.648
There's no officers here.
I got this, sergeant.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.488
How the hell...

09:27.720 --> 09:29.688
...did you end up in processing?

09:30.440 --> 09:33.523
What was it?
Poker night? Bachelor party?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.643
If it's all the same to you, sergeant...

09:35.920 --> 09:38.730
...I'd like to explain that
to my commanding officer in Washington.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.361
- If you'll take me to a phone...
- Haven't you heard?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.041
We're T-minus-Haul-Ass-H-Hour.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.609
We're fixing to invade France.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.526
This whole FOB's on lockdown.
No calls, in or out.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.880
- Name is Farell.
- That's right.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.806
Master Sergeant Farell.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.121
You're an American.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.289
No, sir. I'm from Kentucky.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.491
Okay. Well, look at me.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.850
And look at where I am.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.005
I've been railroaded.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.446
It's obvious I don't belong here.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.405
So please, sergeant, there has to be a way
I can make a phone call.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.605
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.922
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.615
Where you from in Kentucky?

10:35.640 --> 10:37.760
Little town called Science Hill. Heard of it?

10:37.880 --> 10:38.722
I have now.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.928
- Where you from?
- Cranbury, New Jersey.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.770
They grow a lot of cranberries there?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.490
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.449
Why they call it Cranberry, then?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.091
Why they call it Science Hill?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.084
Never asked. Don't care.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.321
After you.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.929
You're not taking me to a phone, are you?

11:02.160 --> 11:03.525
No, I am not.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.001
Seems about the only honest thing
you said to me so far is your name.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.491
Says here you're a deserter.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.881
It says here you were caught
impersonating an officer.

11:15.120 --> 11:15.803
It says here...

11:16.040 --> 11:19.840
...you'd likely try to make an outside call,
compromise security of this operation.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.606
Anything to get out
of combat duty tomorrow.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.524
But that's not gonna happen.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.206
Even

11:26.440 --> 11:27.930
Private Cage.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.811
<i>Take you down to the early days</i>

11:37.040 --> 11:38.166
<i>When the champagne</i>

11:38.400 --> 11:40.004
<i>Flow like a river stream</i>

11:40.240 --> 11:41.600
Rumor is a terrible thing.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.923
Come nightfall, these men will all reach
the same conclusion.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.164
That you're a coward and a liar,
putting your life above theirs.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.128
Good news is...

11:49.360 --> 11:50.771
...there's hope for you, private.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.571
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.610
Battle is the great redeemer.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.049
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.926
The one place where all men
truly share the same rank...

12:02.200 --> 12:05.761
...regardless of what kind
of parasitic scum they were going in.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.964
Squad! This here...

12:09.240 --> 12:10.651
...is Private Cage.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.121
Private Cage, J Squad.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.640
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

12:15.920 --> 12:18.241
Those sure ain't officer cufflinks.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.280
I see everyone...

12:21.520 --> 12:23.204
...is having a productive morning.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.761
You know, it gives me a swell of pride...

12:26.000 --> 12:27.445
...knowing soldiers of your...

12:27.720 --> 12:30.326
...caliber will be leading
the charge tomorrow.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.204
Tip of the spear.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.244
Edge of the knife.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.407
Crack of my...

12:35.640 --> 12:36.801
...ass.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.371
Shit.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.921
Private Kimmel,
what is my view of gambling...

12:41.160 --> 12:42.969
- ...in the barracks?
- You dislike it.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.480
Nance, why do I dislike it?

12:44.720 --> 12:47.803
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.122
And what is my definitive
position on the concept...

12:50.360 --> 12:51.725
...of fate, chorus?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.482
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.400
You might call...

12:58.480 --> 12:59.970
...that notion ironic.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.250
But trust me, you'll come around.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.284
Private Cage is a deserter.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.081
I'm making you all...

13:10.320 --> 13:11.440
...personally responsible...

13:11.560 --> 13:12.607
...for his deliverance.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.880
He will be combat ready...

13:14.040 --> 13:15.087
...at 0600 tomorrow.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.082
Combat ready?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.004
Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.846
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.721
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him
until he can't piss standing up.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.041
You have to listen to me.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.721
- I will never be combat ready.
- I envy you, Cage.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.081
Tomorrow morning,
you will be baptized. Born again.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.722
PT! Ten minutes!

13:37.640 --> 13:38.482
<i>So everybody</i>

13:38.720 --> 13:40.563
<i>Come along with me</i>

13:40.840 --> 13:43.002
<i>Go down the river
And wash your feet</i>

13:43.240 --> 13:45.242
<i>To where the people
Live a life that's sweet</i>

13:45.480 --> 13:46.811
<i>And a place that's ripe</i>

13:47.040 --> 13:48.849
You're not in uniform...

13:49.480 --> 13:50.686
...private.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.808
<i>Could all combat-ready squadrons proceed...?</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:01.565
It's a new day, people.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.165
Destiny calls.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.808
The world expects only one thing from us: That we will win.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.530
Come on, Kimmel, let's have it!

14:54.960 --> 14:56.564
For chrissake, Kimmel.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.768
I got to be free, man.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.761
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.605
What's that noise? That...

15:06.880 --> 15:07.847
Let's go.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.128
Listen, I've never been in one of these.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.328
I've never been with two girls
at the same time.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.927
You can bet when that day comes,
I'll make it work.

15:16.120 --> 15:16.803
Kimmel.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.321
It's Griff.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.726
Griff. Griff. You bet.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.931
Just think about this, man.
I could hurt somebody with it.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.525
Not with the safety on, you won't.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.041
But...

15:28.720 --> 15:31.326
- Where is the safety?
- Exactly.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.080
It's time.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.926
Bloody hell, it's the Full Metal...

16:13.040 --> 16:14.246
Move.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.001
- Griff.
- Sarge?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.965
- Take care of Private Cage.
- What, all day?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.447
Something tells me
it won't be nearly that long.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.002
- Cage!

17:06.240 --> 17:07.287
- Cage!
- Cage!

17:31.040 --> 17:32.451
We lost Germany.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.091
We lost France.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.247
If we lose today...

17:35.880 --> 17:37.644
...we won't get to fight another.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.881
I know...

17:39.280 --> 17:40.930
...the pressure on you is enormous.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.884
Two minutes to drop.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.730
It's all right to be scared.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.606
Remember,
there's no courage without fear.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.007
Oi!

17:51.720 --> 17:55.247
Oi, mate! I think there's
something wrong with your suit.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.926
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.851
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.680
No one else will.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.082
One minute!

18:07.320 --> 18:09.049
One minute to drop!

18:15.040 --> 18:16.246
Hey.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.603
- Hey!
- What?

18:19.760 --> 18:21.967
How do I turn the safety
off of my weapon?

18:22.240 --> 18:22.968
What?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.409
How do I turn the safety off...?

18:26.640 --> 18:27.641
My God!

18:33.320 --> 18:35.129
Get ready! Thirty seconds...

18:35.360 --> 18:36.805
...to drop!

18:37.320 --> 18:39.004
On my mark!

18:39.400 --> 18:40.845
Stand by to deploy!

18:41.080 --> 18:42.969
Activate drop lines. Remember...

18:46.680 --> 18:48.170
Aah! Aah!

18:49.240 --> 18:50.162
Drop now!

18:50.440 --> 18:51.441
Let's drop! Drop!

18:51.680 --> 18:52.602
Drop!

18:54.720 --> 18:55.243
Drop!

18:55.520 --> 18:56.442
Go!

18:56.680 --> 18:57.886
Go, let's go!

18:58.480 --> 18:59.049
Come on!

19:00.680 --> 19:01.249
Drop!

19:01.480 --> 19:02.083
Drop!

19:06.280 --> 19:07.645
Cage! Drop or die!

19:51.400 --> 19:53.209
Yeah! Whoo!

19:53.440 --> 19:55.169
We made it!

19:55.400 --> 19:56.481
Thank God, we made it!

20:19.280 --> 20:20.327
<i>Select language.</i>

21:07.840 --> 21:09.126
<i>We need help!</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:10.887
<i>We need it now!</i>

22:05.440 --> 22:06.771
What the...?

22:19.280 --> 22:20.566
Private Cage!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.365
You're going the wrong way.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.443
You're gonna miss your moment.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.246
What the hell?

22:26.960 --> 22:28.769
They're not supposed to know
we're coming.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.969
We walked into a slaughterhouse, man.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.120
It's a slaughterhouse!

22:33.320 --> 22:34.481
Pull yourself together!

22:34.720 --> 22:36.370
On your feet, people!

22:37.360 --> 22:38.486
Get in line!

22:38.720 --> 22:40.210
Nance, get me a sitrep.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.011
- Safety! My safety!
- Griff, Ford, cover the flank!

22:43.480 --> 22:46.848
My safety. My safety.
How do I get my safety...?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.440
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- I got traces!

22:50.560 --> 22:52.688
Five hundred meters
and they're coming in fast!

22:52.920 --> 22:54.206
Son of a bitch.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.487
Out of the way!

22:56.280 --> 22:58.806
Look alive if you wanna stay that way!

22:59.040 --> 23:00.246
Firing positions!

23:00.800 --> 23:01.767
Move!

23:03.400 --> 23:04.242
Here they come.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.682
Mean as hell and thick as grass.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.445
Wait till they're right on us!

23:08.680 --> 23:09.408
Few more seconds!

23:12.560 --> 23:13.322
Hey!

23:13.560 --> 23:14.322
Hey!

23:20.480 --> 23:21.527
Fall back!

24:05.120 --> 24:06.167
Ha!

24:06.600 --> 24:08.329
Ha-ha!

24:26.240 --> 24:27.287
<i>Reload.</i>

24:59.320 --> 25:00.003
On your feet...

25:00.240 --> 25:00.968
...maggot!

25:06.320 --> 25:07.845
Get in line before I bust your hole...

25:08.080 --> 25:08.920
...with my boot heel!

25:09.080 --> 25:10.684
Hold up there, sergeant.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.770
Can I help you, sir?

25:16.960 --> 25:18.450
Sergeant Farell. Is it...?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.570
That is my name.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.731
I think I get it.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.127
What was it?
Poker night? Bachelor party?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.161
You know, I'm not sure.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.802
It happens.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.200
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.002
Let me take those...

25:39.240 --> 25:40.162
...for you.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.890
What day is it?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.006
For you?

25:47.440 --> 25:49.124
Judgment Day.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.207
The good news is
there's hope for you, private.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.721
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.564
Battle is the great redeemer.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.525
The fiery crucible in which...

25:58.760 --> 26:00.935
...the only true heroes are...
- The only true heroes...

26:00.960 --> 26:01.961
...are forged.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.048
Did you just interrupt me, private?

26:09.880 --> 26:10.961
Sarge, you're...

26:12.560 --> 26:15.245
You're not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.447
No, I'm not.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.404
Now, where was I?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.127
The fiery crucible.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.520
The fiery crucible...

26:24.760 --> 26:27.286
...in which the only
true heroes are forged.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.244
<i>The one place where all men truly share...</i>

26:29.520 --> 26:33.445
...the same rank, regardless of what kind
of parasitic scum they were going in.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.841
- Welcome to hell.
- Squad!

26:37.080 --> 26:39.686
This here is Private Cage.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.680
Private Cage...

26:42.920 --> 26:44.524
...J Squad.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.046
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

26:46.280 --> 26:48.123
They sure ain't officer cufflinks.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.335
You know, it gives me a swell of pride...

26:50.360 --> 26:52.681
...knowing soldiers of your caliber...

26:52.960 --> 26:54.803
...will be leading the charge tomorrow.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.407
Tip of the spear, edge of the knife.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.963
Crack of my ass.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.802
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gambling in the barracks?

27:04.040 --> 27:06.600
- Dislike it, sergeant.
- Nance, why do I dislike it?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.610
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.935
And what is my definitive position...

27:11.960 --> 27:14.531
...on the concept of fate, chorus?

27:14.760 --> 27:17.764
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.482
You might call that notion ironic.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.326
Trust me, you'll come around.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.483
For chrissake, Kimmel.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.121
- I gotta be free, man.
- All right, man.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.280
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.167
<i>Disengaged.</i>

27:38.640 --> 27:40.324
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.324
Haven't you ever been
in one of these before?

27:44.040 --> 27:45.371
Maybe.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.560
Know where the safety is?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.280
- I'm not sure.
- Good.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.446
I know the pressure on you is enormous.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.889
Two minutes to drop.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.645
It's all right to be scared.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.802
There's no courage...

28:02.040 --> 28:03.565
...without fear.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.126
Oi!

28:05.360 --> 28:06.521
Oi, mate!

28:06.760 --> 28:08.600
I think there's something wrong
with your suit.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.011
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.686
Watch your back out there...

28:16.960 --> 28:17.460
...sir.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.480
- No one else will.
- No one else will.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.768
Ha-ha! Jinx, bitch!

28:28.320 --> 28:31.051
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

28:31.280 --> 28:33.647
Activate drop lines, 30 seconds.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.961
- Remember, hit...
- Hey!

28:48.880 --> 28:49.767
Go! Go!

29:08.040 --> 29:09.041
Whoo-hoo!

29:09.280 --> 29:10.281
We made it!

29:10.560 --> 29:11.686
Behind you!

29:12.600 --> 29:13.601
Look out!

29:53.560 --> 29:54.402
Incoming!

29:57.440 --> 29:58.282
I'm hit.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.060
I'm hit.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.927
How bad is it?

30:03.520 --> 30:06.126
Is there a lot of blood?

30:07.440 --> 30:09.522
You have a hole in your chest.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.288
Really?

30:11.520 --> 30:12.521
Yeah.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.564
Did you just take my...?

30:20.280 --> 30:21.361
My battery?

30:25.040 --> 30:27.088
No, no, no. Holy fu...

30:27.320 --> 30:28.526
Aah!

30:33.560 --> 30:34.243
On your feet...

30:34.520 --> 30:35.169
...maggot!

30:35.400 --> 30:36.765
Sergeant Farell!

30:37.000 --> 30:38.604
Sergeant Farell.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.960
Can I help you, sir?

30:40.080 --> 30:42.845
My name is Major Bill Cage.
I'm U.S. Army Media Relations.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.570
I was not at a bachelor party
or a poker game.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.000
You have an order that says...

30:46.160 --> 30:48.242
...I'm a deserter caught
impersonating an officer.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.891
But what it doesn't say is...

30:50.160 --> 30:52.855
...your name is Master Sergeant Farell
from Science Hill, Kentucky.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.245
If you give me 30 seconds...

30:54.480 --> 30:56.289
...to explain how I know that,
you may save the lives...

30:56.520 --> 30:58.966
...of every soldier on this base.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.482
You have to listen to me! They know
we're coming! They're waiting for us!

31:04.720 --> 31:07.166
I have been there! I've seen it!

31:07.400 --> 31:09.607
You're all doomed! You're doomed!

31:09.880 --> 31:13.680
Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.206
This is J Squad. Yes?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.726
This is J Squad, yes.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.962
Not that I should know that, but okay.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.248
Have any of you met me before?

31:21.520 --> 31:22.601
Bitch, I don't know you.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.490
Exactly! Yes!

31:24.720 --> 31:25.528
Thank you.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.886
Your name is Nance. You're Bibble.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.363
Kibble... Kimmell
You fight balls out. Literally.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.441
Ford. Skinner. Griff.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.727
You're...

31:36.360 --> 31:37.691
He doesn't talk much.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.001
But there's a card game...

31:39.240 --> 31:40.730
...under the bed.
- Thanks a lot.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.120
Kimmel's working on a flush.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.128
Spades... No, clubs.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.089
You're gonna make them eat those cards.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.810
Am I right?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.361
Now...

31:56.240 --> 31:58.402
...what I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.401
It's true.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.842
And you have to listen to me.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.561
Your very lives depend on it.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.561
One minute!

32:22.200 --> 32:23.240
What? What is he...

32:23.320 --> 32:26.290
...saying?
Nance! What is he saying?

32:37.200 --> 32:39.726
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

32:40.720 --> 32:42.609
The ship is about to explode!

32:53.800 --> 32:55.325
Yeah! Whoo!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.210
We made it!

32:57.440 --> 32:58.320
Thank God, we made it!

33:00.280 --> 33:00.849
Aah!

33:01.120 --> 33:03.320
...before I bust your hole with my boot heel!

33:04.000 --> 33:05.286
Yeah! Whoo!

33:05.520 --> 33:07.204
We made it!

33:07.440 --> 33:08.320
Thank God, we made it!

33:26.040 --> 33:26.848
Aah!

33:38.160 --> 33:39.286
I'm sorry. I'm trying to save you.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.487
We're getting...

33:40.720 --> 33:42.680
...slaughtered.
You need to get us off this beach.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.730
We have to go. This drop ship...

33:50.000 --> 33:51.411
...is about to explode.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.846
We have to go now.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.567
Wait.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.242
Come on!

34:12.920 --> 34:13.887
Come on!

34:17.719 --> 34:18.721
Come on!

34:18.960 --> 34:20.371
This ship is going to explode!

34:21.960 --> 34:22.882
What are you doing?

34:23.760 --> 34:25.125
Find me when you wake up.

34:26.159 --> 34:26.728
What?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.199
Come find me when you wake up.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.320
Aah!

34:31.960 --> 34:32.609
On your feet...

34:32.880 --> 34:33.880
...maggot!

34:38.360 --> 34:40.567
Get in line before I bust your hole
with my boot heel!

34:40.840 --> 34:42.888
Good news is there's hope for you, private.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.326
Battle is the great redeemer.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.409
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.920
The one place where all men truly sh...

34:56.719 --> 34:57.721
Squad, this here is...

34:57.960 --> 35:00.088
Private Cage.
And you must be J Squad.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.641
It's good to meet you.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.405
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

35:03.640 --> 35:05.085
- Those sure...
- These sure ain't officer's...

35:05.320 --> 35:06.731
...cufflinks.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.690
Keys in the...

35:10.960 --> 35:13.008
...left pocket, probably.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.568
Private Cage is a deserter.

35:19.840 --> 35:23.322
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

35:23.600 --> 35:27.207
He will be combat ready
by 0600 tomorrow.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.046
Private Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.930
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.687
- If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him...
- No. I'm not gonna run.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.643
- Not a chance.
- Till he can't piss standing up.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.450
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.445
What next? A little, PT?

35:55.680 --> 35:57.444
PT! Ten minutes!

35:58.120 --> 36:01.966
Left! Left! Left!

36:02.200 --> 36:04.851
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

36:05.080 --> 36:06.440
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

36:07.000 --> 36:09.162
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

36:09.400 --> 36:10.765
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

36:11.000 --> 36:12.968
It's gonna be my 20th battle tomorrow.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.567
- You haven't been in 20 battles, mate.
- I have too.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.531
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.161
Why don't you get yourselves a cup
of shut-the-hell-up?

36:21.440 --> 36:22.771
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.490
I bet I set a record tomorrow.

36:24.720 --> 36:28.247
Fastest time running backwards, Ford,
slipping in your own shit.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.009
Knock off the grab-ass!

36:31.800 --> 36:32.687
Grab this, sarge!

36:32.960 --> 36:33.961
Hold up!

36:36.680 --> 36:37.681
Private, drop...

36:37.960 --> 36:38.961
...and give me...

36:40.840 --> 36:41.841
Fifty, Sarge?

36:43.280 --> 36:44.691
That's right.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.046
Fifty.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.408
Platoon!

36:48.480 --> 36:49.322
Drop and give me 50!

36:50.280 --> 36:52.089
Compliments of Private Cage.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.890
Thank you, Sarge.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.164
- And one!
- One!

36:56.440 --> 36:57.441
- And two!
- Two!

36:57.680 --> 36:58.840
- And three!
- Three!

37:04.840 --> 37:06.569
Aah!

37:09.160 --> 37:11.367
What the hell were you thinking?

37:11.600 --> 37:15.002
There's hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.288
Battle is the great redeemer.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.525
- Three!
- Three!

37:19.760 --> 37:21.171
- Four!
- Four!

37:21.400 --> 37:22.925
- Five!
- Five!

38:05.880 --> 38:08.486
Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.408
Excuse me.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.725
Sergeant Vrataski?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.322
Excuse me.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.971
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?

38:40.040 --> 38:41.644
Have I got something on my face?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.524
You did. You did.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.564
Tomorrow. At the beach.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.604
Tomorrow. At the beach.

38:49.120 --> 38:49.962
We meet.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.571
You said to find you when I wake up.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.927
You do know what's happening to me.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.491
Come with me.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.440
Now.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.411
You don't talk to anyone
about this but me.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.530
The best-case scenario is
you're gonna end up in a psych ward.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.046
Worst case, you'll get...

39:10.320 --> 39:11.970
...dissected for study. Are we clear?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.446
- Yes?
- Yes.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.364
First time you died, what happened?

39:15.600 --> 39:16.886
- You killed a mimic?
- Yes.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.640
- Describe it.
- It was different.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.611
It was bigger. Bluish.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.882
And you got covered in its blood.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.563
As a matter of fact, I did.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.366
They know we're coming
on the beach tomorrow.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.443
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

39:33.280 --> 39:35.328
How do you know this?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.371
Could you just...? Wait!

39:37.640 --> 39:39.324
Wait. Wait.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.691
Would you explain to me
what the hell is happening.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.447
What happened to you
happened to me.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.842
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.606
That's great. There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

39:50.840 --> 39:52.251
First, I need your help.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.801
Help with what exactly?

39:55.720 --> 39:57.165
Winning the war.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.160
Let's go! Come on!

40:37.160 --> 40:38.240
Rita, what is this?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.926
What are you doing here?
You gotta give me some warning.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.249
- Who's this?
- He's me. Before Verdun.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.925
He's gonna help us.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.883
What? You mean he's...?

40:52.120 --> 40:53.121
Yes.

40:55.680 --> 40:56.727
When did he die? Where?

40:56.960 --> 40:57.927
On the beach. Tomorrow.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.480
How many fingers am I holding up
behind my back?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.291
How should I know that?

41:05.800 --> 41:06.483
Okay.

41:06.720 --> 41:10.486
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.927
- You should try this on him.
- What is that?

41:13.160 --> 41:14.491
It doesn't work.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.920
Has he had any visions yet?

41:17.120 --> 41:18.042
Visions of what?

41:18.320 --> 41:19.287
There's still time.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.249
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I'm sorry.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.164
Who is this? Who are you?

41:24.240 --> 41:27.289
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.408
He's also the only other person
who'll believe what's happening to you.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.642
No one understands mimic biology
better than him.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.445
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.849
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita
and now I'm just...

41:39.080 --> 41:41.208
...a "mechanic with psychiatric delusions."

41:41.440 --> 41:42.362
Carter.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.801
Show him.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.806
Yeah, right.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.490
Right. Well, first of all...

41:54.720 --> 41:55.975
...you're not fighting an army.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.402
You have to think of this
as a single organism.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.923
Now, these common drones,
they act like...

42:02.200 --> 42:02.769
...its claws.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.806
And Alphas, like the one that you killed,
are much more rare.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.241
Yeah. They're like one in...

42:08.480 --> 42:09.960
- ...6.18 million, by my guess.
- Yes.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.605
They act as the enemy's...

42:11.880 --> 42:13.480
They're like its central nervous system.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.210
But this...

42:15.440 --> 42:17.090
...is the brain.

42:17.480 --> 42:20.529
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.

42:21.680 --> 42:25.366
And the Omega has the ability
to control time.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.562
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

42:28.800 --> 42:31.246
...an automatic response is triggered.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.046
The Omega starts the day over again.

42:34.320 --> 42:37.608
But you see, this time,
it can remember what's going to happen...

42:37.840 --> 42:39.285
...just like you do.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.601
It knows exactly...

42:40.840 --> 42:42.735
...what we're gonna do
before we're gonna do it.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.411
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
- It can't lose.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.169
But if that's true,
how did you win at Verdun?

42:50.400 --> 42:52.323
We were allowed to win.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.370
This thing wants us to believe
we can win.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.683
It wants us to throw everything we have
into the invasion.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.810
Operation Downfall isn't our endgame...

43:02.040 --> 43:03.690
...it's the enemy's.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.570
The thing you've got to understand is...

43:05.800 --> 43:08.167
...this is a perfectly evolved...

43:08.400 --> 43:10.687
...world-conquering organism.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.445
For all we know,
there are millions of those asteroids...

43:14.680 --> 43:16.080
...floating around in the cosmos...

43:16.200 --> 43:17.406
...like a virus.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.562
They're just waiting...

43:18.800 --> 43:21.371
...to crash-land into a world
with just the right conditions.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.002
All they need is for the dominant life form
to attack and:

43:25.840 --> 43:27.695
There'll be nothing to stop the mimics...

43:27.720 --> 43:29.643
...from conquering the rest of the world.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.162
Unless you change the outcome.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.766
Me?

43:35.040 --> 43:37.691
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.928
Cage, you've seized control...

43:40.160 --> 43:42.686
...of the Omega's ability to reset the day.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.487
- How's that even possible?
- Perhaps this organism's...

43:46.760 --> 43:49.650
...only vulnerability,
its only vulnerability...

43:49.880 --> 43:50.881
...is humanity.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.727
Regardless of that,
you control the power now.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.883
Just as I did in Verdun.

43:57.680 --> 43:58.920
So I'm resetting the day?

44:01.680 --> 44:02.886
Okay.

44:03.800 --> 44:04.801
How do I control it?

44:08.080 --> 44:09.730
You have to die.

44:10.520 --> 44:11.760
Every day.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.042
Until the Omega's destroyed.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.245
First of all...

44:28.480 --> 44:30.403
...this is a terrific presentation.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.205
Terrific.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.725
I know the general.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.689
We should take this to him.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.808
- You just tell him everything you told me.
- I went to see the general.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.483
Any number of times.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.284
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?

44:50.400 --> 44:52.846
What are you expecting from me?

44:55.720 --> 44:57.404
Have you seen anything strange?

44:58.960 --> 44:59.961
Is he shitting me?

45:00.200 --> 45:01.042
Visions.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.487
Visions.
Have you seen any visions like that?

45:05.120 --> 45:07.009
The Omega senses
when it's losing control...

45:07.240 --> 45:10.084
...of its power.
Even now it's mentally searching to find you.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.004
When it's close to finding you...

45:12.240 --> 45:15.210
...you will start having visions.
You'll start to see that.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.687
You'll even see where it is.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.726
And you had these visions?

45:21.280 --> 45:22.406
Yes.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.443
But eventually you saw it.
I mean, you actually saw it.

45:28.680 --> 45:29.806
Right?

45:32.400 --> 45:33.447
Never in the flesh.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.442
So this is all just some...

45:41.440 --> 45:42.680
...theory.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.931
You don't know if this thing even exists.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.721
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.
I could see it. I...

45:50.640 --> 45:51.926
I just...

45:52.160 --> 45:54.561
...lost the power before I could get to it.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.960
And by the time we took...

45:57.160 --> 45:58.161
...Verdun...

45:59.360 --> 46:01.362
...the Omega was gone.

46:03.960 --> 46:06.008
Okay. So all I have to do is...

46:06.280 --> 46:08.203
...wait to have these visions...

46:08.440 --> 46:11.967
...and then tell you
where this Omega thing is.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.765
No. Cage.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.368
You're gonna get me there.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.126
And I'm gonna kill it.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.686
Get you there?

46:22.840 --> 46:24.842
I'm not even trained for combat.

46:40.960 --> 46:41.640
<i>Reload.</i>

46:42.480 --> 46:43.845
<i>Reload.</i>

47:02.920 --> 47:04.365
Are you all right, Cage?

47:05.160 --> 47:06.605
I think I broke something.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.086
What?

47:08.960 --> 47:10.121
My back.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.766
The only thing I can feel are my lips.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.767
Now listen carefully.
This is a very important rule.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.963
This is the only rule.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.124
You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.

47:24.040 --> 47:24.882
Why?

47:25.120 --> 47:26.963
Last time I was in combat...

47:27.240 --> 47:28.366
...I was hit.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.810
I was bleeding out.
Just not fast enough.

47:32.520 --> 47:33.800
I woke up in a field hospital...

47:34.000 --> 47:37.482
...with three pints of someone else's blood
and I was out.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.689
I lost the power. Do you understand?

47:42.240 --> 47:43.480
Think we better start over.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.687
- Don't you?
- What?

47:46.000 --> 47:47.161
Aah!

47:49.360 --> 47:51.360
No one knows
what happened to Private Cage!

47:51.920 --> 47:53.570
You dumb-ass. He was right next to you.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.286
You don't know
where that slippery son of a bitch went?

47:56.560 --> 47:57.891
No, Sarge!

47:58.120 --> 47:59.610
All right.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.888
Let's do another 50, shall we?

48:02.120 --> 48:03.007
And one!

48:03.560 --> 48:05.449
No, wait! Wait. My name is Bill Cage.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.923
I.. We met on the beach.
We meet on the beach. Tomorrow.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.286
I have what you had.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.482
All right, let's go again.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.487
You don't have time to think. Remember.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.680
It's not enough knowing
where they're going to be.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.121
You have to know how to kill them.

48:33.960 --> 48:37.362
Hold on. Hold on. Listen. List...

48:38.360 --> 48:39.361
Okay. Do it.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.727
Unh!

48:42.480 --> 48:43.320
On your feet, maggot!

48:47.960 --> 48:49.883
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

48:50.120 --> 48:51.804
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!

48:52.040 --> 48:54.566
Wait a Sec. Wait a second.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.204
You know, I've been thinking.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.171
I mean, this thing's in my blood.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.286
So maybe there's some way...

49:02.880 --> 49:04.803
...I can transfer it to you.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.082
I've tried everything. It doesn't work.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.890
I mean, have you...

49:09.680 --> 49:10.681
...you know...

49:12.280 --> 49:14.487
...tried all the options?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.122
You mean sex. Yep. Tried it.

49:18.360 --> 49:19.202
How many times?

49:19.440 --> 49:20.248
All right.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.329
Left.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.280
Left! Left, left!

49:28.640 --> 49:29.641
Keep your eyes open.

49:33.040 --> 49:33.563
Again.

49:34.600 --> 49:35.100
Again.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.523
Again.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.522
Again.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.606
Just wait! Wait.

49:48.880 --> 49:49.881
I think I'm okay.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.246
Unh!

49:52.240 --> 49:52.843
On your feet!

49:53.320 --> 49:54.207
Maggot! Maggot!

49:54.840 --> 49:56.922
I'm trying to be nice to you, maggot! Move!

49:59.760 --> 50:00.761
You okay, Cage?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.604
Yeah, yeah! I'm good! I'm good!

50:02.840 --> 50:03.841
Your leg's broken.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.321
No. I can still feel my toes.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.920
Come on.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.365
Aah!

50:29.480 --> 50:32.290
Rita. Rita. What is this?
What are you doing here?

50:32.520 --> 50:34.329
- Who's this guy?
- He's me...

50:34.560 --> 50:35.960
- ...before Verdun.
- Before Verdun.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.321
What do you mean? He's...?

50:37.560 --> 50:38.766
- Yes. Yes.
- When did he die?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.650
- Where?
- On the beach. Tomorrow.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.215
I'm Bill Cage. You're Dr. Carter.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.800
We've had this conversation before.
Two fingers behind your back.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.524
I've had the visions.

50:46.760 --> 50:47.886
I've seen the Omega.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.208
Um...

50:53.920 --> 50:56.526
It's pretty much game over tomorrow.

50:56.760 --> 50:57.966
So can we move this along?

50:59.400 --> 51:01.129
Okay. Where?

51:02.320 --> 51:04.004
There's a dam.

51:04.280 --> 51:06.040
It's in the mountains. I saw German writing.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.255
Do you think you can work out
where that is?

51:08.280 --> 51:09.725
I mean, there can't be...

51:10.000 --> 51:12.720
...too many places that fit that description.
I'll see what I can do.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.444
Training's over. I'll see you tomorrow.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.215
We don't even know where we're going.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.571
We will soon enough.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.162
In the meantime, you need to figure out
a way to get us off that beach.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.323
What next? Where are we going?

51:47.560 --> 51:48.891
Which way? Focus. Which way?

51:49.160 --> 51:50.207
- I'm thinking.
- Okay.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.961
Man!

51:52.680 --> 51:53.920
How far did we make it?

51:54.880 --> 51:58.089
You know, it's hard to say, really.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.409
Hold! Hold!

52:02.120 --> 52:03.326
Okay, go!

52:05.360 --> 52:06.202
Son of a bitch!

52:06.440 --> 52:09.011
I thought stepping left, ducking...
Just for the record.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.607
- It was pretty specific.
- Stepping left, ducking right.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.889
Stepping left, ducking right. Move on.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.325
Hold on! Now, remember:

52:20.560 --> 52:23.245
Across the trench, 12:00!

52:23.480 --> 52:24.641
Then look to your right!

52:31.360 --> 52:32.646
You're not being specific.

52:32.920 --> 52:35.082
You need to be specific. Otherwise, I'm dead.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.405
Rita.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.201
Cage!

52:42.320 --> 52:44.971
...Paces up to the top of the trench.
I'm gonna step left.

52:45.200 --> 52:46.725
A mimic there, which I'll kill.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.966
...Ship explosion.
I'm gonna run 30 paces northwest.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.602
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench
and then I'm gonna turn left.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.250
Have I got something on my face?

53:15.360 --> 53:16.361
No.

53:24.720 --> 53:25.801
Cage!

53:26.040 --> 53:27.883
We've been looking everywhere for you.

53:28.680 --> 53:29.681
Cage!

53:30.280 --> 53:32.362
- Cage, we've been looking...
- Guys.

53:33.080 --> 53:34.491
Guys. Can we...

53:34.720 --> 53:35.846
...just...

53:36.080 --> 53:37.161
...not do this today?

53:37.760 --> 53:39.330
What are you talking about?

53:39.560 --> 53:41.562
Farell almost strung us up
by our bollocks for losing track...

53:41.800 --> 53:42.608
...of you.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.690
Okay, Skinner. Watch this.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.204
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.805
- Ready?
- Yeah.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.011
Sneaky...

53:58.240 --> 53:59.241
...bastard.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.369
I didn't mind the extra push-ups.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.081
It's a new day...

54:12.320 --> 54:13.560
...people.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.491
Destiny calls.

54:15.720 --> 54:19.122
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.

54:34.920 --> 54:37.095
<i>- Current situation on the front line.</i>

54:37.120 --> 54:39.327
<i>Our troops have suffered heavy casualties.</i>

54:39.560 --> 54:42.120
It's about time we showed
those things what we're made of.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.567
My father flew in the Battle of Britain.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.810
Three years before the Yanks
came into the war.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.644
Couldn't be broken.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.881
Backbone.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.280
My Uncle George landed
on the beach at Normandy.

54:53.440 --> 54:54.441
Yeah?

54:54.720 --> 54:57.371
In their day,
this war would have been over by now.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.324
What do they want with us, anyway?

54:59.600 --> 55:01.409
It's obvious, isn't it? Minerals.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.210
- Minerals?
- Yeah, minerals. Metals.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.686
- Oxygen, they want.
- Oxygen?

55:04.920 --> 55:07.120
- Think about it.
- What difference does it make?

55:07.240 --> 55:09.368
They're here. They're winning.

55:09.600 --> 55:12.046
And whatever it is, they're gonna get it.

55:12.320 --> 55:13.360
Shouldn't you be...

55:13.440 --> 55:14.441
...over there?

55:15.320 --> 55:16.367
I've been over there.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.122
More times...

55:18.360 --> 55:19.486
...than anybody.

55:19.720 --> 55:23.725
As a matter of fact,
I'm usually long dead by now.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.481
Coward.

55:30.800 --> 55:31.961
What's going on?

55:32.200 --> 55:33.440
The power's gone.

56:41.720 --> 56:42.926
I found the Omega.

56:43.160 --> 56:45.970
I found it. It has to be here.
Curnera Dam, Germany.

56:46.200 --> 56:49.170
- This has got to be it. It fits the description.
- You found it.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.925
Again.

56:51.160 --> 56:52.650
What difference does it make?

56:53.280 --> 56:54.930
Because we're never gonna get there.

56:56.160 --> 56:57.321
No matter what we do...

56:58.400 --> 57:00.846
...no matter how carefully we plan...

57:01.720 --> 57:03.722
...we can't get off that beach.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.566
You can do this. You can.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.168
You keep coming here every day
and I'll train you.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.445
You already have.

57:44.080 --> 57:47.402
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- Five hundred meters and closing fast!

57:48.040 --> 57:49.371
What the...?

57:57.880 --> 57:58.927
<i>Reload.</i>

58:11.080 --> 58:12.411
What's next?

58:14.080 --> 58:16.560
Straight shot up the hill.

58:17.040 --> 58:18.246
Okay.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.721
Hey, sarge, the new guy...

58:21.960 --> 58:23.405
...what's his name again?

58:27.200 --> 58:30.283
We'll need a vehicle to get further inland.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.766
What's the problem?

58:32.000 --> 58:35.322
The ambush waiting for us.
They kill us before we find a working car.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.244
Okay. So, what's the current plan?

58:37.920 --> 58:39.120
Two cars we haven't tried yet.

58:39.360 --> 58:42.284
- The minivan and the green SUV.
- Yeah. Okay.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.444
I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me.
You go for the minivan.

58:45.680 --> 58:48.524
You get it started, just go, take off.
Do not wait for me.

58:48.760 --> 58:49.886
Okay.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.885
Just don't forget to disconnect the caravan...

58:53.120 --> 58:55.043
...before you take off.
You are going to be...

58:55.280 --> 58:57.931
...in a hurry, you don't want any dead weight.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.881
Come on.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.881
Come on, Cage!

59:43.000 --> 59:44.843
<i>- Casualties. The enemy has breached...</i>

59:45.080 --> 59:46.286
<i>...security at Dover.</i>

59:46.560 --> 59:47.607
Can't see.

59:49.880 --> 59:51.041
Can you?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.001
<i>Stay where you are and remain calm.</i>

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.320
<i>If you are in a vehicle...</i>

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.124
<i>...please lock doors...</i>

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.600
<i>...and stay inside.</i>

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.046
<i>I'm sorry. The enemy has reached London.</i>

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.611
<i>Repeat:</i>

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.245
<i>London is under attack.</i>

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.761
Good driving.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.286
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.642
<i>Engage.</i>

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.529
You don't talk much.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.885
I'm not a fan.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.451
Of talking?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.648
Not a fan of talking. No.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.407
You know you eventually do talk to me.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.200
It's usually around Lyons.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.165
You tell me about the time
you went there with your family.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.084
Your brother got lost.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.923
I've never been to Lyons.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.124
You tell me your middle name.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.960
Peyton.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.123
That's not my middle name.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.486
You find your brother
in the arcade, by the way.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.807
Well, maybe I made it all up
just to keep you quiet.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.160
But you do talk to me.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.328
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.723
If you knew what was good for you,
you wouldn't want to get to know me.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.201
It's the only way
you make it through this thing.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.162
What about Hendricks?
You get to know him?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.611
- How do you know that name?
- You mentioned him.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.841
That's not possible.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.406
Then how do I know his name?

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.120
When did I mention him?
Under what circumstance?

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.443
Is he why you won't talk to me?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.561
Don't ever mention his name again.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.001
Why? Are you...

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.765
...in love with him?
- He's dead.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.923
And I watched him die 300 times...

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.811
...and I remember every detail.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.123
I remember everything.
So I don't need to talk about it.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.640
I'm sorry.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.530
It's just war.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.602
There's nothing here. Let's keep going.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.401
We have to find the keys.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.211
Let's just siphon the gas.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.330
- Why drive when we can fly?
- In that thing?

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.011
- Let me guess. You're afraid of heights.
- I'm afraid...

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.481
...of crashing.
And not at all ashamed to admit it.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.161
You'll be fine, Cage. You'll learn.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.801
What is it?

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.326
It's nothing. I'm fine.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.445
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.681
Rita.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.086
Let me see.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.162
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.687
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.925
You know, the heli's full of fuel, though.
I found a hose.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.003
We're flying, Cage.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.841
Let's just say we find...

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.082
...the keys. You know?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.362
Get that helicopter started.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.200
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.684
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.489
Might be better off just going back
to the farmhouse.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.245
Seeing what we could salvage.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.563
Spend the night there.
Come back here in the morning.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.326
And curl up by the fire
and open a bottle of wine.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.445
I think we should just reset.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.289
Whoa!

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.124
It's a dead end.
If it's all the same to you...

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.930
...I'm tired. I'm in pain.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.764
- I'd rather just start fresh.
- Tell you what.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.401
Take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.360
I'll look for the keys. That's productive.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.130
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.481
Then I'm killing you.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.601
Fine.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.320
I can't believe you found coffee.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.201
Thank you.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.481
Sugar, right?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.281
Yeah.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.651
- Thank you.
- No, hold on. Three. You like three.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.246
There's a shirt over there.
It should be your size.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.887
How many times have we been here?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.047
How many times?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.691
Where are the keys?

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.200
- Where are the goddamn keys?
- Okay.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.206
You can fly it, can't you?

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.771
No. Well, yes.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.480
I mean, I can take off.
I'm still working on my landing.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.569
What are we still doing here?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.360
- You're wasting time!
- Rita, if you start that engine, you die.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.129
This is as far as you go.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.765
No matter what I do...

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.082
...this is as far as you ever make it.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.202
There's a mimic buried 20 yards away.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.169
It attacks when you start the engine.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.126
Get your weapon
and get in the helicopter, Cage.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.488
There's more in the field back there.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.005
Only one of us ever makes it.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.321
Get in.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.160
Only thing we haven't tried is you walk away.
Go to the farmhouse.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.406
There's a cellar, food.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.203
Wait there...

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.363
...till I get back. You'll be safe.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.849
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.
I'm not walking away.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.481
You die here. Right here.

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:19.242
I can't save you.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:22.848
And if I go on and kill the Omega,
you're dead.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.127
Forever.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.805
Why does it matter what happens to me?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.441
I wish...

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.691
...I didn't know you.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.291
But I do.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.129
My middle name...

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.890
...is Rose.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.330
On your feet, maggot!

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.895
<i>The good news is there's hope for you, private.</i>

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.844
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.570
Battle is the great redeemer.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.247
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.761
Yes?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.883
Who said you could talk to me?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.687
Have I got something on my face, soldier?

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.009
I'm sorry to disturb you, sergeant.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.482
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.321
Where's your helmet?

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.569
Never wear one. It's a distraction.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.127
Have you been drinking?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.362
I need three more clips of 5.56...

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.490
...eight grenades and an extra battery.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.161
Get it.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.281
Oi!

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.050
Oi, mate!

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.850
There's something wrong with your suit.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.284
There's a dead guy in it.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:26.968
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.440
We made it!

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.125
Thank God, we made it!

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.166
Finish it!

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.123
- It isn't there.
- What do you mean?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.044
My guess is it never was.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.681
They knew we were coming.
They ambushed us.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.450
The visions were a trap.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.247
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.251
It could have killed me, but it didn't.
It was after my blood.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.687
So they know who you are. They...

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.491
They want their power back.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.849
They're gonna get it one way or another.
Unless we find the Omega.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.090
- There isn't any other way. We're finished.
- No.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.283
We're not finished.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.601
I can't get it to work.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.285
You built a prototype at Whitehall.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.841
Yes, and I got fired for it,
thank you very much.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.884
- What is this thing?
- It's a transponder.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.164
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into
the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.209
That's the idea, anyway.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.920
I can't get it to work.
Not with the equipment I have.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.131
How do we get what you need?

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.931
That's the thing.
When I was at Whitehall, I built one.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.650
I was even ready to test it.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.201
When I told my superiors about it,
I lost my job.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.726
They thought he was crazy.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.811
So we need to go to Whitehall.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.720
She'd be arrested...

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.525
...10 feet from the door.
Psych ward, dissection, remember?

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.000
Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.651
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.042
The transponder requires a live Alpha
to make it work.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.890
We don't need one.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.361
We got the next best thing.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.723
When the Chinese delegation comes out...

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.450
...we pick up the pace.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.645
This guy with the yellow armband
always recognizes you...

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.288
...so just keep your head down
and stay to my right.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.171
Nicely done.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.207
Three, two, one. Go.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.487
One...

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.611
Six, seven...

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.841
...eight...

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.041
Twelve...

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.641
Fifteen. Now.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.689
And, turn.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.768
Okay. Keep walking.
Just stare straight ahead.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.641
Robinson.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.205
I've asked not to be disturbed.
This had better be critical.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.521
The fate of mankind.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.966
Critical enough?

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.005
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.447
I've had more than my share of that.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.041
Sit down, general. Stay away from the desk.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.122
I'd take her...

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.964
...very seriously if I were you.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.688
Have to hand it to you, major.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.605
When you left this office today,
I never imagined you'd be back...

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.207
...let alone with my most decorated soldier.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.801
I'm gonna tell you a story.
It's gonna sound ridiculous.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.321
The longer I talk,
the more rational it's going to appear.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.880
Tell him you'll call back.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.650
Tell who?

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.400
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax.
His plane's just been delayed. Bad weather.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.361
Yes.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.568
Thank you, Beaumont. I'll call you back.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.560
Tomorrow's invasion...

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.927
...is a slaughter.
I'm dead within minutes of landing...

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.447
...along with every other soldier
you are sending.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.200
And that's because the enemy knows
we're coming.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.442
How do I know this? Before I died...

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.768
...I killed a mimic,
only this one was different.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.764
It passed something on to me. In my blood.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.367
Now I live the same day over and over again.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.641
Just like they do.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.080
Just like Sergeant Vrataski...

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.446
...at Verdun.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.967
Tell your secretary everything's fine.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.326
Beg your pardon?

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.170
Sorry, general. I thought you were alone.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:50.969
It's fine.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.288
She typed up those orders
for you to authorize.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.204
But she left out the ones referring
to the fuel dump...

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.680
...at Greenwich.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.641
Your name is Iris.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.161
Your birthday is September 17th.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.845
The general pulled some strings...

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.760
...stationed your son in Australia,
as far from the war as possible.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.361
Tell the general...

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.520
...his dinner's been canceled.
Call just came in.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.881
Your dinner was canceled.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.330
You forgot the fuel dump.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:17.962
Thank you, Iris.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.201
That'll be all.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.442
- Cage, let's go. Come on.
- Rita.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.126
- Let me... Don't shoot him again.
- What are we doing?

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.609
Okay? Just...

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.769
General, this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.169
That's because you're stubborn.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.646
You won't believe me when I tell you...

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.968
...that Dr. Carter was right.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.884
That the enemy can manipulate time.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.488
The invasion will fail.
No matter how many bodies you throw at it.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.924
The only way to win this war is...

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.165
...by finding this power source
of the mimic horde and killing it.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.489
And the only means of finding it
is in that safe right there.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.970
No matter how many times
we have this conversation...

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.483
...you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks
through to London tomorrow...

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.690
...and we lose. We lose everything.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.360
Let's say for one moment...

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.440
...that I can't rationally explain...

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.490
...your impressive parlor tricks.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.921
Dr. Carter told me...

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.323
...this device requires a live mimic to work.
What use is it to you?

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.080
- That's my concern.
- On the contrary.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.008
According to you,
this concerns the whole world.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.969
Well, what would you do if you believed
everything I just told you?

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.521
I would locate this...

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.488
Omega.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.801
Bomb it out of existence.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.806
You're not mentally equipped to fight
this thing. And you never will be.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.930
What do we do now?

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.531
I don't know. We've never gotten this far.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.248
That was easy.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.362
Down!

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.523
Stop right there! Don't move!

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.285
Nobody move!

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.282
Weapon!

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.161
Stop!

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.045
- They're off and away!
- They're...

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.200
What do I do with this?

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.767
Stick it in your leg. Do it!

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.805
Cage, what's happening?

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.921
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.887
<i>I feel it. It's taking me there.</i>

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.841
<i>What do you see?</i>

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.011
<i>It's the Louvre.</i>

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.360
<i>Where? Where are you?</i>

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.088
<i>I'm inside now. It's flooded.</i>

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.887
<i>Now I'm going down. I'm in a garage.
A garage underneath the museum.</i>

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.650
<i>The Omega. Can you see it?</i>

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.002
It's in Paris.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:53.723
Rita!

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.851
Stay in the car!

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.729
- Stay back.
- Move away. Move away.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.410
What have you done?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.323
What have...

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.561
...you done?

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.080
You'll be fine. You just needed blood.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.162
You don't know...

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.084
...what you've just done.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.120
I can't talk to you.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.486
I was with someone.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.329
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.127
Rita Vrataski.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.001
Please.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.206
Just tell me that.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.208
Please...

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.487
...tell me.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.761
I'm sorry.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.320
I was out of those things...

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.360
...in three minutes flat.
What's wrong with you?

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.605
I thought you were dead.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.486
Not yet.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.140
Sorry, Cage.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.561
No! Whoa. Wait! Wait!

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.040
I'm out. I'm out.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.765
They gave me blood.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.451
I lost the power.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.686
I feel it.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.522
I can't reset the day anymore.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.011
We have to kill the Omega...

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.163
...before the invasion starts.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.162
That gives us less than three hours.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.526
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.771
Need more soldiers too.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.721
Now, who's crazy enough
to follow us to Paris?

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.567
Cage!

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.767
Cage!

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.240
- Guys!
- We've been looking...

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.287
...everywhere for you.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.560
- Just listen.
- Farell almost strung us up...

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.041
- ...for losing track of you.
- I know. Just listen.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.611
You're gonna wanna hear this.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.484
It's gonna sound ridiculous at first.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.411
The longer I talk, the more rational
it's going to appear.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.567
Yeah?

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.444
He named the school I went to.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.646
And then he tells me
my second grade teacher...

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.245
...was called Miss Polio.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.965
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom...

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.255
...made him wet his pants.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.122
Shut up.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.082
Look, I am telling you, man.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.805
He knows everything.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:22.927
About all of us.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.083
- Bullshit.
- Yeah?

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.647
He says your name ain't really Ford.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.250
Says Ford was your friend.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.006
Died in combat on his first day.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240
You took his place.
Send your checks to his family.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.728
You slippery bitch.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.880
Cage says the enemy...

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.923
...knows us too.
They're waiting for us.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.482
And we all die.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.563
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.123
Well, this is great.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.647
Really good confidence boost for tomorrow.
Thanks.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.450
But we can change it, right?

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.404
There has to be something that we can do.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.728
There has to be a way that we can win.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.044
There is a chance. It's a slim one.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.287
But it means coming with me right now.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.407
Listen, pal.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.291
I don't really care what you think
you know about us.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.325
We just met you.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.281
Why follow him into combat?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.207
I don't expect you to follow me.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.283
I expect you to follow her.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.320
- That's the Full Metal Bitch.
- J Squad.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.649
This is Rita Vrataski.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.848
- Otherwise known as...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.688
The Angel of Verdun.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.281
Okay.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.289
It's a new day, people.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.965
Destiny calls.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.488
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.327
Rest assured the enemy will thank you
for not giving 100 percent today.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.288
Squad?

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.166
Where's J Squad?

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.888
Right, okay.
So this Omega, it controls time.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.561
Just blow the New Age bollocks
back where it came from.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.687
And then we go home.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.926
- Right, it's guarded by an Alpha.
- Just kill it.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.002
Okay?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.002
No!

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.605
You heard what Cage said.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.245
Do not kill an Alpha.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.608
If we do,
the Omega will reset this whole day.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.290
We'll never remember
we had this conversation.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.329
They're gonna know we're coming.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.080
What am I supposed to do
if an Alpha is about to kill me?

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.004
You take a hit for the team.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.606
When we're on the ground...

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.965
...there's not gonna be a lot of time
before they know we're there.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.331
We're gonna need eyes up here.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.005
I'm going in, Cage.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.530
Thirty seconds till contact.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:43.883
Cage!

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.565
Kimmel! No!

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.242
Ford!

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.049
Let's go!

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:57.820
Cage!

01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.960
Talk to me, Rita! We gotta go.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.809
Drop.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.730
Cage, they know we're coming, man!

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.286
Drop! Drop!

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.007
Drop!

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.483
Drop.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.801
You're not hooked in.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.885
What took you so long?

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.971
Any others?

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.086
We're low on ammo.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.091
I've got one Claymore. Ford, you're out.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.011
Griff has only got half a magazine
and he can hardly move.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.089
I thought you could see the future.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.685
I haven't lived this day.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.284
I don't know what's gonna happen.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.131
It doesn't matter.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.885
What matters is we finish this.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.846
With what?

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.771
I mean, Griff can't even walk.
We're three men down.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.520
- Come on.
- We're running out of time.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.324
Collect your ammo.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.040
Must be a thousand mimics
between us and the pyramid.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.202
What we gonna do?
Walk up to the front door?

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.562
- If we stay here, we die.
- Yeah?

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.685
We'll never get through.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.241
We could.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.081
In that.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.890
That ship will never fly.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.171
Doesn't need to fly.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.208
It just needs to get us
across there with speed.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.282
If the engines are...

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.490
...still running,
we could steer it with the power levers.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.562
Skinner.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.601
Clear a path.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.242
- Try it again, now.
- No, it's not reading.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:46.320
Condition lever, low.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.691
Master power, on.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.961
Griff!

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.048
We've gotta go! Come on!

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.842
I'm not gonna be any good in there, mate.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.530
Let me buy you some time.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.322
Power's on.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.641
This is gonna work.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.401
Hey!

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.202
Hey, come on, man! We gotta go!

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.965
Don't wait for us!

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:24.962
Skinner!

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.690
Griff, come on!

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.126
- We're good to go. Where are they?
- Where's Skinner and Griff?

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.886
They're not coming.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.567
Go, brother. You gotta go, man.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.245
I'll see you in the next life.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.086
Bollocks.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.131
Move over! Move over!

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.971
We gotta go!

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.326
Yo, we gotta go now!

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.724
They're coming, Cage.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.249
Come on, you bastards! Come on!

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.646
<i>Reload.</i>

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.564
<i>Reload. Reload.</i>

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.850
We got incoming!

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.807
Come on!

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.451
Cage!

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.170
You have to take over!

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.483
Rita!

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.207
Punch it! Punch it!

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.200
We've been through worse.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.282
Okay.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.561
It's there.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.841
In the water. There.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.086
That's an Alpha.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.164
I'm gonna draw that thing away.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.406
You kill the Omega.

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.325
No. You won't make it 10 feet...

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.130
...before that thing kills you, Cage.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.771
- I can do it.
- Take the grenades.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:15.922
I can do it.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.241
Listen to me.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.445
Listen to me.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.326
Neither one of us is getting out of here.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.691
Thank you...

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.603
...for getting me this far.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.564
You're a good man, Cage.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.448
I wish I had the chance
to know you better.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.450
Welcome to London, major.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.960
I'm Corporal Montgomery...

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.601
...your liaison to General Brigham's
press office.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.685
Very good to have you.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.646
Have you heard the news? Isn't it brilliant?

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:53.000
<i>Just before sunrise this morning...</i>

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.370
<i>...a large surge of energy
was detected in Paris.</i>

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.050
<i>We do not know exactly what this signifies.</i>

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.884
<i>But the result appears to be...</i>

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.930
<i>...a total collapse
of the enemy's capacity to fight.</i>

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.205
<i>Russian and Chinese troops are now moving
across Europe without resistance.</i>

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:14.971
<i>Tomorrow, we advance on the western front.</i>

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.886
<i>We believe we are marching
to claim victory for ourselves...</i>

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.411
<i>...for our loved ones, for our countrymen...</i>

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.369
<i>...for the entire human race.</i>

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.931
What are you? Sound off!

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:26.968
I'm a warrior!

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.690
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.570
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.201
- You have not been in 20 battles.
- I have too.

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.727
You're gonna dump your load
the second you hit the beach.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.407
How about you two go get yourselves
a nice hot cup of shut-the-hell-up!

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.562
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.928
I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.846
Fastest time running backwards, Ford,
slipping in your own shit.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.809
Knock off the grab-ass!

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.561
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.922
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.440
Attention!

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:39.881
Yes?

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.487
What do you want?
