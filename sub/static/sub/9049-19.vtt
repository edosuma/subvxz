WEBVTT

00:05.008 --> 00:07.576
Are you guys reading books?

00:09.212 --> 00:11.179
Since Austin's world
tour starts in a week,

00:11.181 --> 00:13.281
I'm helping him learn
some foreign languages.

00:13.283 --> 00:15.517
I can ask, "where
are the pancakes?"

00:15.519 --> 00:17.152
In fifteen different languages.

00:17.154 --> 00:18.487
French...

00:21.691 --> 00:22.991
Mandarin...

00:24.661 --> 00:26.194
Even pig Latin.

00:26.196 --> 00:29.364
"Ere-whay are-ay
e-thay ancakes-pay?"

00:31.701 --> 00:33.535
You guys are a
couple of oof-days.

00:35.038 --> 00:37.039
What's with the animal
print pillows?Ãš

00:37.041 --> 00:38.874
I'm turning the practice
room into my new office.

00:38.876 --> 00:40.942
What gives you the right?

00:42.412 --> 00:44.212
Dez, calm down.

00:44.214 --> 00:47.916
She'll be running the music factory while
I'm at school and Austin's on tour.

00:47.918 --> 00:49.317
What do you care anyway?

00:49.319 --> 00:51.887
You'll be finishing film school
and hanging out with Carrie

00:51.889 --> 00:54.322
way on the other
side of the country.

00:54.324 --> 00:56.058
Oh, I can't wait.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.093
Aw, I'm going to miss you too.

00:58.095 --> 00:59.761
I'm going to miss all you guys.

00:59.763 --> 01:02.731
Well, no matter where
life takes us,

01:02.733 --> 01:05.099
we'll always have this place
to bring us together.

01:05.102 --> 01:07.569
And luckily, we'll have Trish
to take really good care of it.

01:07.571 --> 01:10.439
And I promise to make the
school my top priority.

01:10.441 --> 01:13.742
Trish, it's so great that you're
taking this so seriously.

01:13.744 --> 01:18.146
Nothing means more to me than than
the A&A music... oh, my hot tub!

01:20.183 --> 01:22.084
What? It's for my new office.

01:22.086 --> 01:24.419
It'll fit. I just got to
get rid of the piano...

01:24.421 --> 01:26.254
And all that music junk.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.446 --> 02:24.579
I was thinking.

02:24.581 --> 02:27.949
Since we won't be together for a
lot of the holidays this year,

02:27.951 --> 02:31.586
we should celebrate all of them
this week before we leave town.

02:31.588 --> 02:32.621
Great idea.

02:32.623 --> 02:36.858
We can do our anniversary,
Christmas, Valentine's day.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.693
There's only one problem.

02:38.695 --> 02:41.196
I'm actually leaving
for my tour in a hour.

02:41.198 --> 02:42.631
What?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.099
April fools!

02:45.469 --> 02:47.202
Cross that one off the list.

02:52.209 --> 02:53.942
I got her the audition.

02:53.944 --> 02:57.512
The play is directed by my
mentor and hero, Spike Stevens.

02:57.514 --> 02:59.181
He's also starring in it.

02:59.183 --> 03:02.384
But I thought he only did movies,
like the one I starred in.

03:02.386 --> 03:04.219
<i>You know? The pilot
and the mermaid.</i>

03:04.221 --> 03:06.955
<i>Based on the book, the
mermaid and the pilot.</i>

03:06.957 --> 03:10.091
Oh. You ignorant fools.

03:11.694 --> 03:13.862
If you knew anything
about Spike,

03:13.864 --> 03:16.331
you'd know his first
love is musical theater.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.867
And now, he's come home.

03:19.802 --> 03:21.369
This could be huge!

03:21.371 --> 03:22.737
I read about it online.

03:22.739 --> 03:26.208
Well, if I get the part, I'd have
to do a little juggling between

03:26.210 --> 03:28.210
running the factory
and doing the play.

03:28.212 --> 03:30.812
But who am I kidding?
It's a long shot.

03:30.814 --> 03:32.247
A very long shot.

03:33.182 --> 03:35.183
But I know what Spike
demands of his actors.

03:35.185 --> 03:36.818
I can help you. Watch...

03:36.820 --> 03:37.953
And repeat.

03:38.888 --> 03:40.021
Happy.

03:40.023 --> 03:41.389
Sad.

03:41.391 --> 03:42.424
Happy.

03:42.426 --> 03:43.625
Sad.

03:46.329 --> 03:47.862
Come on, you're not doing it.

03:47.864 --> 03:49.164
Happy.

03:49.166 --> 03:50.265
Sad.

03:50.267 --> 03:51.399
Happy.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.867
Sad.

03:52.869 --> 03:54.402
Ooh, mad! Nice.

04:04.347 --> 04:05.580
Happy easter-versary.

04:05.582 --> 04:07.582
Oh.

04:07.584 --> 04:09.718
I bought you an
anniversary present.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.921
It's hidden inside an easter egg
somewhere in the restaurant.

04:12.923 --> 04:14.256
Aw, thanks.

04:14.258 --> 04:16.458
I'll hunt for it after we order.

04:19.228 --> 04:22.130
I can't believe we
only have a week left.

04:23.232 --> 04:24.699
I'm really gonna miss you.

04:24.701 --> 04:28.470
But we'll still talk all the time and
write songs together over the phone.

04:28.472 --> 04:32.540
Actually, I don't know how much
time I'll have for songwriting.

04:32.542 --> 04:37.879
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've
decided to put music on hold for awhile.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.081
Seriously?

04:40.083 --> 04:41.283
You're not gonna make music?

04:41.285 --> 04:44.052
Well, Harvard's gonna
keep me really busy.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.287
It's very competitive.

04:45.289 --> 04:49.124
I'll be taking a lot of hard classes
with a lot of super smart people.

04:49.126 --> 04:50.458
Wow.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.161
You're gonna be meeting all
kinds of smart Harvard people,

04:53.163 --> 04:57.265
doing all kinds of smart Harvard
stuff, eating smart Harvard food.

04:57.267 --> 05:00.568
Well, I'm not sure food
can really be smart.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.903
Sure it can.

05:01.905 --> 05:05.840
I just saw this thing on TV about
celery that can sing babies to sleep.

05:05.842 --> 05:10.111
Are you talking about that diaper
commercial with the singing celery?

05:10.113 --> 05:12.180
Oh, maybe.

05:13.450 --> 05:15.317
You're so cute.

05:17.753 --> 05:19.688
Happy
easter-best-friend-aversary!

05:19.690 --> 05:24.426
Trish told me we're celebrating a
year's worth of holidays, so...

05:24.428 --> 05:26.094
Here I am.

05:27.129 --> 05:29.364
Uh, no. We're celebrating.

05:29.366 --> 05:31.466
That's what I said...
"we're celebrating."

05:31.468 --> 05:35.270
And Austin, I found the
gift you hid for me.

05:37.373 --> 05:39.674
How did you know my
favorite letter was "a"?

05:45.147 --> 05:47.849
Spike, thank you so
much for this audition.

05:47.851 --> 05:50.018
Don't thank me, impress me.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.220
Rooftop scene, go!

05:54.123 --> 05:55.790
What happened to
us, jazzy McGee?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.492
We used to be best friends.

05:57.494 --> 05:59.527
You were the mustard
to my hot dog.

05:59.529 --> 06:03.298
Well, trixie, that was before you left
me in the dust when you hit it big.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.569
Your record may be gold,
but your heart sure ain't.

06:07.571 --> 06:09.704
I cross over here.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.806
I turn, and then you say...

06:11.808 --> 06:15.977
I learned it from you. You destroyed
what was most precious to me.

06:15.979 --> 06:19.581
And now, I'm gonna
do the same to you.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.750
Now we fight over my saxophones.

06:21.752 --> 06:23.418
Struggle, struggle, struggle!

06:23.420 --> 06:26.988
I fall backwards and hang from
the ledge while you sing.

06:50.579 --> 06:52.046
That...

06:52.048 --> 06:53.248
Was...

06:53.250 --> 06:55.250
I know, Spike, she did nothing.
I...

06:55.252 --> 06:56.518
brilliant!

06:57.621 --> 06:59.154
I taught her
everything she knows.

07:01.023 --> 07:03.591
Trish, I have chosen you

07:03.593 --> 07:08.296
<i>to be the star of my production
of the singer and the sax player!</i>

07:08.298 --> 07:12.434
<i>Based on the novel, the sax
player and the singer.</i>

07:13.602 --> 07:14.969
I can't believe it. Really?

07:14.971 --> 07:16.538
Jennifer Lawrence wanted it.

07:16.540 --> 07:17.872
But you know what?

07:17.874 --> 07:19.607
She can't hold a candle to you.

07:19.609 --> 07:24.112
In fact, according to her people, she
refuses to hold a candle at all,

07:24.114 --> 07:25.475
so it never would
have worked out.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.516
Because of the big candle
holding scene in act two.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.655
Pack your bags, we're taking
this show on the road!

07:34.590 --> 07:36.991
On the road? I thought we
were performing in Miami.

07:36.993 --> 07:40.428
We open in Miami, and then we're
performing all around the country.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.629
Oh, no.

07:41.631 --> 07:43.765
I'm sorry, Spike, but I
already made a commitment

07:43.767 --> 07:45.467
to stay here and run
the music factory.

07:45.469 --> 07:46.968
I can't let my friends down.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.236
Nonsense!

07:48.238 --> 07:52.407
Stick with me, and your name
will be in lights on Broadway.

07:52.409 --> 07:54.142
Can you see the sign?

07:54.144 --> 07:57.011
<i>"The singer and the sax player.</i>

07:57.013 --> 07:59.647
<i>"Based on the novel the sax
player and the singer.</i>

07:59.649 --> 08:00.748
"Starring Trish..."

08:01.951 --> 08:03.384
Whatever your last name is.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.520
It's beautiful.

08:05.522 --> 08:07.856
"Starring Trish beautiful."

08:10.493 --> 08:12.093
I see a sign too.

08:12.095 --> 08:13.761
It's in front of
the music factory.

08:13.763 --> 08:15.663
It says, "closed forever."

08:17.533 --> 08:18.967
Oh, there's another sign.

08:18.969 --> 08:21.503
It says, "going out
of business sale.

08:21.505 --> 08:23.037
"Trumpets, 70% off."

08:23.039 --> 08:24.739
Oh, it's actually a
pretty good deal.

08:30.713 --> 08:34.381
What a beautiful day,
not a cloud in the sky.

08:34.384 --> 08:37.684
The perfect... battle stations, giant
baby duck attacking on the port side.

08:37.687 --> 08:40.388
Quack, quack. Ah!
Oh, the humanity!

08:41.525 --> 08:43.857
Dez! What are you
doing in my hot tub?

08:44.793 --> 08:46.828
Uh... not peeing.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.596
That's for sure.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.801
Anyway, since you're gonna
be off doing the play,

08:53.803 --> 08:56.838
this is no longer your
office, or your hot tub.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.473
Don't get too comfortable.

08:58.475 --> 09:00.008
I haven't decided if
I'm taking the part.

09:00.010 --> 09:02.677
Well, you've just got
to ask yourself,

09:02.679 --> 09:05.280
do you want to be the captain
that keeps the factory afloat?

09:06.215 --> 09:10.451
Or do you want to be the duck that flaps
its wings and flies off to Broadway?

09:14.156 --> 09:15.990
I think I want to be a duck.

09:15.992 --> 09:18.560
But that means having to
close down the factory.

09:18.562 --> 09:22.730
Well, you need to do what
makes you happiest, like me.

09:22.732 --> 09:25.212
The store clerk said I could never
pull off horizontal stripes,

09:29.838 --> 09:31.739
That's not the word I would use.

09:31.741 --> 09:35.410
All I'm saying is we'll support
you no matter what you decide.

09:36.345 --> 09:37.612
Thanks, Dez.

09:37.614 --> 09:41.215
I know we have our differences,
but when I really need a friend,

09:41.217 --> 09:42.784
you've always been there for me.

09:43.719 --> 09:44.619
Aw.

09:44.621 --> 09:46.287
I'll miss you too, Trish.

09:46.289 --> 09:48.456
Oh, Dez!

09:48.458 --> 09:49.624
You're getting my
clothes all wet!

09:49.626 --> 09:51.793
Shh! Don't ruin this.

09:51.795 --> 09:52.795
Oh.

09:57.199 --> 09:59.200
Happy new year!

09:59.202 --> 10:01.769
And also, happy Thanksgiving.

10:01.771 --> 10:04.072
I put a top hat and
tails on the turkey.

10:04.074 --> 10:05.440
Huh.

10:07.276 --> 10:09.644
Did you know the first
new year's celebration

10:09.646 --> 10:12.313
was held 4,000 years ago
by the baby-lonians.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.316
Uh, I think you
mean "babylonians."

10:15.318 --> 10:17.251
I know what I mean.

10:17.253 --> 10:20.922
I'm a smart guy who says smart
things like "indubitably,"

10:20.924 --> 10:23.391
"post-modernism," and...

10:24.293 --> 10:25.793
"Mozambique."

10:26.795 --> 10:29.330
There's a lot more to me than
performing and perfect hair.

10:29.332 --> 10:30.732
I know.

10:30.734 --> 10:32.767
Come on, let's just
enjoy new years.

10:32.769 --> 10:33.935
It's almost fake midnight.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.503
Pfft, you're right. Sorry.

10:36.438 --> 10:38.940
Five, four, three,

10:38.942 --> 10:40.074
two...

10:40.076 --> 10:41.309
One.

10:41.311 --> 10:42.944
Happy new year!

10:46.281 --> 10:48.182
Ooh! Let's share our
new years resolutions.

10:48.184 --> 10:49.751
All right.

10:49.753 --> 10:52.520
This year, I want some more
alone time with my boyfriend.

10:52.522 --> 10:54.088
Ugh, boring.

10:54.090 --> 10:56.924
Guys, I'm sorry to interrupt,

10:56.926 --> 10:59.560
but I have some really important
news that can't wait.

11:00.696 --> 11:02.597
After thinking long and hard...

11:03.532 --> 11:04.866
I've come to a decision.

11:06.035 --> 11:09.937
Austin, Ally, I...

11:09.939 --> 11:12.540
Ugh, what Trish is
taking forever to say

11:12.542 --> 11:14.876
is that she's gonna go on
tour with Spike's musical,

11:14.878 --> 11:17.345
so we're gonna have to shut
the music factory down.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.380
- W...
- Happy New Year!

11:19.382 --> 11:20.848
Sad new year.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.283
Happy new year!

11:22.285 --> 11:24.152
Sad new year. Happy new year!

11:24.154 --> 11:26.521
Sad new year. Happy new year!

11:28.657 --> 11:33.227
Guys, I'm really sorry about this, but
I can't pass up this opportunity.

11:33.229 --> 11:37.732
I love being onstage, and Spike says
this could lead to a career on Broadway.

11:38.667 --> 11:42.070
Trish, if acting is your passion,
you have our full support.

11:42.072 --> 11:45.073
Although you did kind of promise
you'd stay here and run the factory.

11:45.075 --> 11:48.209
Well, I don't see you canceling
your tour to stay here and run it.

11:49.144 --> 11:50.912
This stinks.

11:50.914 --> 11:53.781
Without the factory, we'll probably
never talk to each other again.

11:54.717 --> 11:55.983
What? Why would you say that?

11:55.985 --> 11:58.553
Let's face it, you're
going on tour.

11:58.555 --> 12:01.389
You'll probably replace me with a
new offbeat, redheaded best friend.

12:02.524 --> 12:04.192
What about you?

12:04.194 --> 12:06.894
You'll go to L.A. and replace me
with another pop star best friend

12:06.896 --> 12:10.231
like Justin Bieber, or Justin
Timberlake, or some other Justin.

12:10.233 --> 12:12.233
Come on, you guys
are being silly.

12:12.235 --> 12:15.236
Are we? What about you,
quacking off to Broadway.

12:15.238 --> 12:17.905
You'll find a whole new flock
and forget all about us.

12:17.907 --> 12:19.578
You're the one who told me to
be a duck and follow my dream.

12:19.602 --> 12:20.642
Oh, that was this morning!

12:23.360 --> 12:25.680
Wait, does this mean you're
gonna be too busy to manage me?

12:25.682 --> 12:27.348
What are you even talking about?

12:27.350 --> 12:29.617
Everyone calm down,
this is ridiculous.

12:29.619 --> 12:31.352
Oh, so I'm ridiculous now.

12:31.354 --> 12:33.454
No one ever said you
were ridiculous.

12:33.456 --> 12:34.891
Ally, just because
you're going to Harvard

12:34.915 --> 12:37.358
doesn't mean you're qualified to tell
people when they're not ridiculous.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.928
Yeah, if we wanna be ridiculous,
we don't need your permission.

12:40.930 --> 12:43.881
You know, ever since you got into
Harvard, you can't stop talking about

12:43.912 --> 12:45.900
how excited you are to hang
out with smart people,

12:45.902 --> 12:47.468
like we aren't good
enough for you anymore.

12:47.470 --> 12:49.637
What? I never said that!

12:49.639 --> 12:51.639
You didn't have to,
it's in your tone.

12:52.741 --> 12:55.977
Yeah, you're going to smarty-pants
school with smarty-pants people,

12:55.979 --> 12:57.667
it's just a matter of
time before you find a

12:57.679 --> 12:59.379
new boyfriend with
really smart pants on.

13:00.149 --> 13:02.717
Wait, is this what the
baby-lonians thing was about?

13:02.719 --> 13:03.730
Isn't it "babylonians"?

13:03.761 --> 13:07.421
If I want to pronounce it "baby-lonians,"
then that's how I'm going to say it!

13:07.423 --> 13:09.991
Baby-lonians, baby-lonians,
baby-lonians!

13:11.426 --> 13:13.728
You know what, if you're
all gonna act like this,

13:13.730 --> 13:15.763
maybe it's best we're
going our separate ways.

13:15.765 --> 13:17.131
Yeah!

13:19.768 --> 13:21.502
Dez, separate ways.

13:21.504 --> 13:22.837
Right!

13:45.794 --> 13:47.929
I hope this place
officiated enough for you.

13:47.931 --> 13:50.731
I know you Harvard types
love your theater.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.037
Well, at least I know theater wasn't
invented by the baby-lonians.

13:57.306 --> 14:00.508
Will you two keep it down? I'm
trying to watch the play.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.977
It hasn't even started yet.
You're staring at a curtain.

14:02.979 --> 14:05.112
Nothing I do is good
enough for you.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.827
What happened to
us, jazzy McGee?

14:19.829 --> 14:21.062
We used to be best friends.

14:21.064 --> 14:23.531
You were the mustard
to my hot dog.

14:23.533 --> 14:28.436
Well, trixie, that was before you left
me in the dust when you hit it big.

14:29.705 --> 14:33.040
Your record may be gold,
but your heart sure ain't.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.709
I learned it from you.

14:34.711 --> 14:37.178
You destroyed what was
most precious to me,

14:37.180 --> 14:40.548
and now I'm gonna
do the same to you.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.149
Give me that saxophone!

14:42.151 --> 14:43.517
Never!

14:49.158 --> 14:50.591
Ah!

14:54.063 --> 14:56.831
Go ahead, take your revenge.

14:56.833 --> 15:00.935
We lived as friends, but
we'll part as enemies.

15:06.742 --> 15:08.209
Maybe we can work this out.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.044
We can still be friends.

15:10.046 --> 15:12.680
Uh... no.

15:12.682 --> 15:13.915
Nope.

15:13.917 --> 15:17.451
Pretty sure it's time for
you to take your revenge!

15:19.888 --> 15:23.858
We've been too close too long to allow
one little tiff to come between us.

15:23.860 --> 15:26.193
Stick to the script!

15:28.096 --> 15:32.099
Well, I forgive you anyway, because
that's what friends are supposed to do.

15:34.937 --> 15:38.205
Friends are supposed to be there
for each other, no matter what.

15:38.207 --> 15:40.975
Just sing the revenge song!

15:42.044 --> 15:45.346
Actually, I have
something else in mind.

18:17.899 --> 18:19.633
We're sorry, Trish.

18:19.635 --> 18:21.068
Let's never fight again.

18:21.070 --> 18:22.470
Can we group hug now?

18:27.075 --> 18:29.915
Really hate to break this up, but could
we please do our closing number?

18:36.785 --> 18:38.919
I'm so glad that we're
not fighting anymore.

18:38.921 --> 18:40.955
That was so silly.

18:40.957 --> 18:44.225
Well, clearly the fight was a manifestation
of our fears of losing each other.

18:45.293 --> 18:49.930
What Dez means is our fight was
merely the byproduct of our sadness

18:49.932 --> 18:52.900
and heartache rather
than any true animosity.

18:57.139 --> 18:59.940
Look who's wearing the
smarty-pants now.

18:59.942 --> 19:01.075
Mozambique.

19:04.246 --> 19:07.848
Ally, I'm sorry for
acting so jealous.

19:07.850 --> 19:09.817
I was just missing you already.

19:09.819 --> 19:11.785
I feel the same way.

19:11.787 --> 19:16.190
And you don't have to worry about me
falling for some brainy Harvard guy.

19:16.192 --> 19:19.193
I love you for you
and I always will.

19:20.462 --> 19:21.729
I love you too.

19:25.934 --> 19:27.001
And Trish...

19:27.003 --> 19:28.202
I'm good.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.273
I also have a going
away present for you.

19:32.275 --> 19:35.676
Actually, it's a going away/birthday/
groundhog day present.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.081
Your songbook?

19:42.184 --> 19:44.018
You're letting me touch it?

19:44.020 --> 19:45.819
I'm letting you have it.

19:45.821 --> 19:47.555
It's full of memories.

19:48.490 --> 19:52.226
And I wrote some new songs for
you to use while I'm at school.

19:53.128 --> 19:54.195
Ooh, can I see it?

19:54.197 --> 19:55.529
Don't touch my book!

19:56.699 --> 19:59.366
Ah, there's my star!

19:59.368 --> 20:03.404
Now, Trish, are you ready to
take this show on the road?

20:07.375 --> 20:09.677
Actually, Spike, I'm not.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.545
I've decided I want
to stay in Miami.

20:11.547 --> 20:13.080
Uh...

20:13.082 --> 20:14.348
You can't do that.

20:14.350 --> 20:16.083
What about following your dream?

20:16.085 --> 20:18.152
Yeah, I thought you
loved the theater.

20:18.154 --> 20:19.853
I do.

20:19.855 --> 20:22.423
And that's why I want to stay and
open up a musical theater program

20:22.425 --> 20:24.225
for kids here at the factory.

20:24.227 --> 20:26.560
I'm afraid you leave
me no choice.

20:26.562 --> 20:28.195
Fine.

20:28.197 --> 20:29.263
Spike,

20:30.432 --> 20:32.333
I'll be your gorgeous jazz lady.

20:34.002 --> 20:35.336
- No.
- Aw.

20:35.338 --> 20:41.041
Trish, I, Spike Stevens, refuse
to do the show without you.

20:41.043 --> 20:45.846
<i>Therefore, the singer and the sax
player will remain in Miami!</i>

20:45.848 --> 20:48.682
Really? Oh, thank you!

20:51.953 --> 20:54.288
I can't believe it. We
get to keep the factory,

20:54.290 --> 20:56.090
I still get to star in the play.

20:56.092 --> 20:59.426
And best of all, hot tub.

20:59.428 --> 21:01.695
Whoo! Hot tub. Cannon ball!

21:08.470 --> 21:10.638
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

21:12.808 --> 21:15.876
You guys look hilarious.
Let me get a picture.

21:17.646 --> 21:19.380
Aw.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.322
- Ally!
- Austin!

21:28.324 --> 21:30.424
It is so good to see you.

21:30.426 --> 21:32.459
- I missed you so much.
- Me too.

21:32.461 --> 21:33.927
I can't believe it's
been four months.

21:33.929 --> 21:35.462
How was school?

21:35.464 --> 21:37.564
Hard, but amazing.
How's the tour?

21:37.566 --> 21:39.900
It's been fun but
also really lonely.

21:39.902 --> 21:43.170
And it kind of got
me thinking...

21:43.172 --> 21:45.239
About us.

21:46.841 --> 21:50.678
I didn't know it at the time, but the
day I walked into the music store,

21:50.680 --> 21:52.713
was the greatest day of my life.

21:54.115 --> 21:55.649
Because it's the day I met you.

21:58.253 --> 22:00.688
There's so much about the
future I don't know,

22:00.690 --> 22:05.392
but the one thing I'm sure of is there's
no way I can make it without you.

22:07.295 --> 22:09.330
So...

22:09.332 --> 22:11.098
Ally Willow Dawson,

22:12.534 --> 22:14.868
will you make me the
happiest man alive and...

22:15.937 --> 22:17.338
Marry me?

22:18.540 --> 22:20.507
Austin.

22:22.043 --> 22:23.777
I can't.
