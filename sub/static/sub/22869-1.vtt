03:19.440 --> 03:20.920
Yeah.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.997
Yeah, of course I remember you.
That's why I gave you my card.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.391
Yeah. Yeah. Ankle monitors don't
just fall off. You cut them off.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.596
It's a big difference.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.077
Because it's a violation.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.431
- How you doing?
- I'm here.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.995
Well, I can't advise you to do that.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.800
I hear banging.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.275
- William Henry Jackson.
- Well, open it. Heh.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.194
Right, open it before they kick it in.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.718
- Hello?
- No.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.640
- No. Dear Jesus.
- Hello?

04:01.840 --> 04:04.878
Oh, God. Where'd they take him?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.556
Roman! William's had a heart attack
outside his building.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.756
He's at MLK.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.992
- Is it serious?
- Of course it's serious.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.514
He's at the emergency room.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.717
Call the hospital
and see what you can learn.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.833
I'll tell you what to do.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.037
Get Kibby on the phone.
He can cover for him.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.993
- Kibby retired.
- When?

04:26.200 --> 04:30.558
Years ago. Now, listen, Roman,
William had a full day today.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.279
- Okay.
- You have to cover for him.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.194
- Okay.
- Tell the clients and the prosecutors...

04:35.360 --> 04:38.398
- ...and the judges what's going on.
- Okay.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.279
Get continuances.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.999
- Okay.
- Just continuances.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.196
Just continuances.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.829
I typed up his day.
It's in there on my desk.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.435
- All right.
- Dear Lord.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.318
Okay.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.115
Just continuances.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.959
<i>All metal goes in the trays.</i>

05:08.160 --> 05:11.232
- Phones, change.
- Step forward, please.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.357
If you have a belt, please remove it.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.510
Keys.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.194
Any loose change.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.990
You must remove it
so it can be scanned.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.230
Next person.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.471
Put your arms out. Just hold right there.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.236
Listen, my iPod, I got 8000 songs in here.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.278
The last time I put that in there...

05:30.440 --> 05:34.559
...I lost the bass range
on Gil Scott-Heron's "Winter in America."

05:34.720 --> 05:36.473
Brian Jackson.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.037
Everything gets scanned.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.157
- Step up, please.
- Next.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.639
Thank you, sir.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.677
All phones off.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.991
Phones off.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.160
All phones off.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.551
Excuse me, sister. Where's the...?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.951
The court for white folks?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.311
Phones off.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.760
Wack-ass.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.317
Quiet in the court.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.597
Uh, excuse me.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.717
What do you have on number 32?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.997
Langston Bailey?

06:34.080 --> 06:35.878
This says William Jackson's his lawyer.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.397
Mr. Jackson had a heart attack
this morning.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.600
- I'm Roman Israel, his partner.
- I didn't know Jackson had a partner.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.117
Heh. Well, I don't have the,
uh, patience...

06:45.280 --> 06:48.591
...for the butchery that occurs here.
Mr. Jackson does.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.599
You want a continuance?

06:50.800 --> 06:52.519
- What bail you offering?
- No bail.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.200
And he pleads to count one.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.671
I'll tell the judge and request
a minimum five years.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.672
He's facing 15 at trial.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.672
For a 17-year-old breaking and entering?

07:01.840 --> 07:05.675
Hell, why don't we just get it over with
and, uh, heh, shoot him?

07:05.840 --> 07:06.876
That's the offer.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.592
- Do what you gotta do.
- Offer doesn't really...

07:10.760 --> 07:13.355
He's not taking top plea.
I can tell you that.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.480
You're already overcharging him.
Let's talk about mitigating circumstances.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.075
He was caught wearing a T-shirt
with a gang symbol.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.391
Like the flag pin on your lapel.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.959
Five years.
That's as low as the People will go.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.554
What people? There's no people.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.236
There's you making a bullshit
career-climbing offer. Let's admit it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.434
Present it to your client.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.874
His name is Langston.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.192
He's a high school junior in good
standing. Plays on the soccer team.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.556
All of this despite
that his father's in jail...

07:42.720 --> 07:45.519
...his mother is in drug treatment...

07:45.680 --> 07:49.310
...and due to a legion of forces
beyond his control...

07:49.480 --> 07:52.552
...he joined a gang for acceptance,
family and protection.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.355
He has one prior minor offense.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.753
Each one of us is greater
than the worst thing we've ever done.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.630
Deep bows.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.154
Please talk to your client.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.880
- My conviction rate's 100 percent.
- All rise.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.759
Court of District Nine is now in session.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.992
The Honorable James Hurakami
is presiding.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.870
Langston Bailey.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.397
Thank you, bailiff. You may be seated.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.589
Wow, five to seven?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.991
Thought I was going to juvie, though.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.433
I want to speak to Mr. Jackson.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.671
He's in the hospital.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.078
- When's he coming back?
- Wish I knew.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.035
I want a new lawyer.
I want to switch. I have rights.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.192
Mr. Jackson is the one
who comes to court...

08:55.360 --> 08:58.398
...but he comes to me
for legal guidance.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.233
Now, you're being overcharged to accept
a plea and to keep things moving.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.120
They want to punish you
for even asking for a day in court.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.351
It's a volume business.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.198
With guards getting overtime
and private companies owning the jails...

09:12.400 --> 09:14.995
...and building them as well. It's a fact.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.159
You want to fight, we'll fight.
I mean, to hell with the bill.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.630
But if we take it to trial...

09:20.800 --> 09:22.393
...and you lose...

09:23.200 --> 09:25.760
...they hit you with 15 years.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.671
And they rarely lose.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.318
Keep your head up.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.916
And do some push-ups.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.792
This is a preliminary hearing
on the case...

09:43.960 --> 09:47.715
<i>...of The People of the State of California
v. William Carlos Ramirez.</i>

09:47.880 --> 09:50.714
Case number A64-9725.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.792
Counsel will state your names.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.395
People are represented
by Michael Wesley.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.715
Roman J. Israel, Esquire,
on behalf of Mr. Ramirez.

09:59.880 --> 10:04.079
Mr. Israel, I'll grant a continuance,
given lead counsel's medical emergency.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.071
Um... I'd like to dive right in,
Your Honor.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.720
Very good.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.354
Proceed.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.197
Uh, Your Honor, the People request the
defendant, Mr. William Carlos Ramirez...

10:16.360 --> 10:18.750
...be held to answer
on three counts of violating...

10:18.920 --> 10:21.674
...Health and Safety Code
Section 11351...

10:21.840 --> 10:24.753
...possession of powder cocaine for sale.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.152
Mr. Ramirez was observed
and filmed making three drug sales...

10:28.320 --> 10:30.152
...to undercover officers.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.835
Mr. Ramirez made a confession
to detectives...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.196
...that he supported himself
selling drugs.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.756
Objection. Motion to strike.
Mr. Ramirez was told...

10:37.920 --> 10:40.310
...he was not under arrest
and was interrogated...

10:40.480 --> 10:43.473
...without his Miranda warning,
yet he was refused use of the bathroom.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.597
That's a violation of civil rights.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.150
Um, it wasn't an interrogation.
It was an interview.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.349
Overruled.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.399
If a cop hauls you in
and says you can't use the bathroom...

10:53.560 --> 10:56.394
- ...then you're being detained.
- We're moving on.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.392
What was he supposed to do,
pee himself?

10:58.560 --> 11:01.519
- You can address this at trial.
- I would like to address it now.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.280
- I'm just saying we have a real...
- Mr. Israel.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.033
Did you hear what I said?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.554
If...

11:12.920 --> 11:15.594
...armed guards
in this courtroom detained you...

11:15.760 --> 11:18.275
...and would not allow you
to use the bathroom...

11:18.440 --> 11:22.320
...you would be detained. What is good
for the goose is good for the gander.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.915
I'm gonna hold you in contempt
if you pursue this.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.636
With respect, you're asking me
to obey an erroneous court decision.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.359
You tell me to wait.
In my experience...

11:31.800 --> 11:33.075
Okay.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.760
Find you in contempt.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.919
Is there anything else
you'd like to add before I set fine?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.271
<i>I told you to just get continuances.</i>

11:45.440 --> 11:47.113
I'm filing an appeal.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.953
<i>Five thousand dollars?</i>

11:49.120 --> 11:50.520
Well...

11:50.680 --> 11:52.831
"I wouldn't trust a lawyer
that didn't get complaints...

11:53.000 --> 11:55.151
...from the prosecution or the court."
Who said that?

11:55.360 --> 11:57.317
<i>- I have no idea.
- William.</i>

11:57.480 --> 12:01.520
<i>I can always count on you to say
the utterly inappropriate thing.</i>

12:01.680 --> 12:03.990
<i>I'm with Lynn now.
She's very upset about it.</i>

12:04.200 --> 12:05.270
How is he?

12:05.880 --> 12:08.918
<i>It's not good. They're still running tests.</i>

12:09.120 --> 12:11.112
All right, I'll come over to the hospital.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.079
<i>Don't. He's not even in his room.
You understand?</i>

12:14.240 --> 12:15.720
<i>- Yeah.
- What's that?</i>

12:15.920 --> 12:20.199
<i>Well, Lynn says we'll talk about it
tomorrow, Roman. Good night.</i>

13:06.600 --> 13:09.115
<i>This is
the Los Angeles Police Department...</i>

13:09.280 --> 13:10.475
<i>...Noise Enforcement Team.</i>

13:10.680 --> 13:13.115
<i>Please leave your name,
contact telephone number...</i>

13:13.280 --> 13:15.840
<i>...and a Noise Enforcement Team
officer will contact you...</i>

13:16.000 --> 13:19.789
<i>...as soon as possible.
Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>

13:19.960 --> 13:22.953
Yes. My name is Roman J. Israel,
Esquire.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.716
I'd like to report a construction-noise
violation, 570 Gladys Avenue.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.918
That's G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue,
Los Angeles.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.431
City regulation 5612 prohibits
construction...

13:33.600 --> 13:36.752
...and/or repair of any kind...

13:36.960 --> 13:40.192
...between the hours of 7 p. m.
until 7 a. m. the following morning.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.999
Thank you.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.714
<i>MAN Please leave

14:31.880 --> 14:35.271
<i>...and a Noise Enforcement Team officer

14:35.440 --> 14:37.671
<i>Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>

14:37.840 --> 14:39.877
<i>My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire.</i>

14:40.040 --> 14:44.080
<i>I want to report construction noise
at 570 Gladys Avenue.</i>

14:44.240 --> 14:46.994
<i>That's G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue.</i>

14:47.160 --> 14:50.392
<i>City regulation 5612 requires...</i>

14:50.560 --> 14:53.917
...that there is no construction
or repair of any kind...

14:54.120 --> 14:58.956
...between the hours of 7 p. m.
and 7 a. m. the following morning.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.079
Five-six-one-two...

15:02.240 --> 15:03.879
...that's the city regulation.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.269
That's the law.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.635
I'm a lawyer.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.990
Goodbye.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.039
- Hello, Roman.
- Hi.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.994
- This is George Pierce.
- Nice to meet you.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.270
Pleasure.

15:36.440 --> 15:41.231
The doctors have concluded that William
is in a permanent vegetative state.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.672
Oh... Well, he'll surprise them.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.237
Well, we'd like to believe that,
but not this time.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.198
- You get a second opinion?
- He's had three.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.877
Now, Roman, my uncle gave me
financial and medical power of attorney.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.396
If the firm was stable,
we'd have time to mourn...

16:00.600 --> 16:03.160
...but it's not, and we don't.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.109
William's directive asks using George
in the event of incapacitation.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.950
And George has generously offered
to take time from his busy practice...

16:11.120 --> 16:13.316
...to sort through
the remaining cases...

16:13.480 --> 16:16.917
...help close the office
and collect what's due.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.197
Well, I probably haven't had...

16:20.360 --> 16:22.636
...time to consider all the...

16:22.800 --> 16:25.076
...you know,
various ramifications of this.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.392
None of us have.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.039
I can't live on my accolades.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.272
Lynn was hoping to give you and...
What's the receptionist's name?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.999
- Vernita.
- Vernita, severance.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.157
But looking over the books,
it just doesn't seem possible.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.517
I'll take over. Ahem.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.952
No, you're not capable
of continuing the practice.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.760
On your contempt fine, we can argue
extreme emotional distress...

16:52.920 --> 16:54.593
- ...and hope for a reduction.
- Right.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.391
But I'll take over because in the
architecture of this firm, I am a pillar.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.360
Yes, and, Roman,
I'd hoped to reward you for that.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.193
Hope don't get the job done.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.719
- What does that mean?
- That means hope don't get the job done.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.038
Is it ego...

17:17.200 --> 17:19.192
...or delusion?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.872
Honestly, I...

17:22.800 --> 17:26.191
I never paid enough attention to you.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.473
This place runs more like
a charity service than a law firm.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.109
It's run a deficit for years.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.993
We...

17:37.240 --> 17:40.597
...his family, can no longer afford it.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.877
We're clearing the books.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.912
We're handing this off to George.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.991
Roman, I'm sorry.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.155
God, help me.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.117
Yeah, just tell him to wait.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.632
No, just tell him to wait.
I'll be there in 30. Less.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.793
- All right. One sec, one sec.
- So you have...?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.553
- I'll talk to him.
- Uh-huh.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.232
I'm sorry, man.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.119
I feel for you.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.756
This where the Bulldog did his work?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.799
What a mind.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.998
He was great in the seat
and great on his feet.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.080
Jesus, didn't he ever
throw anything away?

18:52.880 --> 18:56.430
My secretary's gonna call.
She'll be point on this.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.315
What do you use?

18:58.480 --> 19:00.915
LegalPRO? Quicken?

19:02.680 --> 19:03.716
What's that?

19:03.880 --> 19:07.271
Status on every case,
depositions, investigations...

19:07.720 --> 19:09.791
- ...conferences.
- What, on cards?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.150
You're kidding.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.154
I'm not helping you fast-plead
just so you can get a fee.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.518
Well, I'm in court every day.
I fight hard for my clients.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.320
You're a low-flying bee.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.757
- Is that what William said about me?
- William never mentioned you.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.116
- What's that about, then?
- Fact.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.715
Recorded fact, every case.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.758
Organized and available.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.630
And you can fact-check that
if you'd like on your legal Quicken.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.393
I don't have time for this.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.950
My office will call
to coordinate going forward.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.793
Let's watch him now.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.553
Young George.

19:42.720 --> 19:47.112
<i>State of California
v. Jason Angelo Fisher.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:49.749
One of his first cases.
Fisher's first offense.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.799
Should have been reduced
to misdemeanor possession.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.199
But you pled him out to felony,
conspiracy and possession.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.238
That became your M. O.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.472
Take a retainer,
waive your client's rights to a prelim...

20:02.680 --> 20:05.878
...then dump them on the
public defenders when they complain.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.350
What, you worked the Fisher case?
His appeal?

20:08.560 --> 20:09.835
I recall reading the record.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.799
- That was seven years ago.
- Eight.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.111
So you're saying you know
all that from memory?

20:15.280 --> 20:18.876
Seven years, eight months, 47 days.
I'm quite confident of my recollections.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.555
Well, my win-loss record is
above 90 percent.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.632
That's false and misleading.
That's only if you count...

20:23.800 --> 20:25.792
...your three years as a prosecutor.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.195
Well, William thought highly enough
to bring me in.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.192
Believe me, I'm going to find out why.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.960
Roman. Hey, Roman.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.959
Where you going?

20:52.760 --> 20:55.355
- Where you going?
- MLK.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.673
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.160
I'd rather walk.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.960
Come on, Roman.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.038
I just want to talk.

21:13.360 --> 21:16.114
William taught a term at Loyola.
That's where we met.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.794
I was, uh, top of my class.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.791
Potential's a bitch.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.474
Well, I'll tell you what's not, is having
four offices and 60 people working for you.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.478
He picked me
because I tossed him work.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.991
You know, loser cases I didn't want,
or I was too busy to handle.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.756
This, closing his office, it's payback.
I'll collect a fee.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.992
Look, it just so happens I could
use someone with your ability...

21:41.160 --> 21:43.436
...and your power
of persuasive argument.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.718
And I'll pay you twice what
William gave you. What do you say?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.633
What makes you different from this car?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.514
Whoa. Really? Okay.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.149
I'm gonna tell you something I think
maybe will surprise and disappoint you.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.677
I got a kickback from William
for every single case I gave him.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.916
Bullshit.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.037
I have the records.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.715
You've been untouched
by the messy business...

22:05.880 --> 22:07.792
...of running
a small criminal-defense firm.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.755
Was it wrong?

22:11.920 --> 22:13.752
On some level, sure.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.991
Does it diminish what he did? Hell, no.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.597
No, it allowed him to keep
the doors open. It kept you two going.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.635
And to this day, I still remember
quotes from his class.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.120
And that voice.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.119
"What is tolerance?
It is the consequence of humanity.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.312
We are all formed of frailty and error.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.234
Let us pardon reciprocally
each other's follies.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.914
That's the first law of nature."

22:34.120 --> 22:36.351
What do you say we forget the past?
Move forward?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.556
Pull over.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.435
I can't work for you.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.000
What are you gonna do?

22:46.160 --> 22:49.278
- I'll continue in criminal litigation.
- That's a bitch of a market.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.033
- What if you can't find something?
- What?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.510
For argument's sake,
if you can't find a firm, what's next?

22:53.720 --> 22:56.030
There is no next.
There is no argument's sake.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.637
There's underwear model
or activist attorney. There is no next.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.271
<i>- Yeah, George.
- I want to bring someone in.</i>

23:21.440 --> 23:23.591
<i>Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?</i>

23:23.760 --> 23:26.514
Jackson had a guy who drafted
all his memoranda.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.000
He's a bit of a savant.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.518
<i>He paid him 500 a week. We can
bill him out for that much an hour.</i>

24:06.640 --> 24:10.156
- Maya. It's Roman Israel.
- Oh...

24:10.880 --> 24:12.234
Sorry to keep you waiting.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.517
I usually work off
scheduled appointments.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.634
It's okay. I had some, uh, pretzels
and soda from down there.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.359
That's fine.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.031
So Jeff tells me you work
with William Henry Jackson.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.396
Yes, for 36 years.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.677
We are... We were partners.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.071
He was the public face of the firm.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.476
I was the man behind the curtain,
so to speak.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.030
- How is he?
- Unconscious several weeks now.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.199
I'm so sorry.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.600
- Well, come on in.
- Oh...

24:50.480 --> 24:52.278
Um...

24:52.960 --> 24:56.749
I have no safeguard
against unemployment.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.152
So William and Ronald...

25:00.320 --> 25:03.313
...were old friends and associates,
going back to Berkeley.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.795
Mm. Yeah, I'm aware.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.792
Ronnie mentions William in his book.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.919
Right. Yes, yes.
I'd like to speak with him.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.720
Ron is at our headquarters
in Washington.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.117
There something I could help you with?

25:16.240 --> 25:19.836
Oh, uh, well, um...

25:20.720 --> 25:22.916
...first, notwithstanding...

25:23.120 --> 25:26.397
...I don't know if I could do this
much longer, progressive lawyering.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.632
You see, I'm not accustomed
without William.

25:30.120 --> 25:34.319
The criminal side of our practice funded
our policy and legal challenges...

25:34.480 --> 25:36.676
...as in defendants' rights...

25:36.840 --> 25:38.718
...prison conditions...

25:38.880 --> 25:41.600
...and drafted attacks
on state and federal criminal codes.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.594
If I was freed from criminal work,
I can get back to my roots.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.195
The bigger battles,
organized mass action...

25:47.360 --> 25:49.272
...supported
by sweeping legal challenges.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.676
With my skill...

25:51.840 --> 25:53.832
...and, uh, experience...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.560
...I'm quite certain
I can get this organization...

25:56.720 --> 25:59.679
...right back in line
with its core beliefs.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.276
- This organization?
- Yes.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.354
Yeah. I wasn't aware
that we, um, had strayed.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.754
I'm not talking about nickel-and-dime
reformism. I'm talking about...

26:09.960 --> 26:13.158
...igniting a sustained mass movement,
supported by rule change...

26:13.320 --> 26:15.391
...and injunctive relief.

26:15.560 --> 26:19.349
And I could get results
using class-action tactics.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.433
I'm talking about a return
to using activist litigation...

26:22.640 --> 26:24.996
...creatively, defensively,
counter-offensively.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.629
I am very proud
of what we've done here.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.476
I think we're making significant headway
in many, many areas.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.030
Well, in my experience, that's...

26:34.200 --> 26:37.034
...an excuse to feel good
and to slack off.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.038
Oh? Who's slacking off?

26:43.640 --> 26:45.597
I attended
Western State College of Law...

26:45.760 --> 26:49.276
...at Argosy in Fullerton.
Started the first student union there.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.794
Uh...

26:52.840 --> 26:55.833
I chose cause over ambition.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.994
I could've joined one of the big firms
like the rest of them and been seduced.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.120
But I was inspired by Mr. Jackson.
I went to work for him. You can...

27:04.720 --> 27:07.554
There's a detailed, uh, record
of all of our victories.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.518
Civil-rights victories on there.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.751
As for my personal life,
at a certain point...

27:11.920 --> 27:14.310
...I had to decide whether to have
a family or career. I couldn't do both.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.518
So I stayed on the front lines.
Now, I'm offering...

27:19.880 --> 27:22.031
...at this time...

27:23.160 --> 27:25.072
...to work...

27:25.600 --> 27:27.557
...exclusively...

27:28.000 --> 27:30.037
...as your, um...

27:30.800 --> 27:32.996
...long-haul, three-dimensional...

27:33.160 --> 27:34.833
...revolutionary...

27:35.000 --> 27:36.832
...in-house, uh...

27:38.040 --> 27:40.396
...full-time, paid advocate.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.956
Mr. Israel, we're all volunteers here.

27:50.520 --> 27:55.549
Our few salaried staff work out of D. C.

27:56.200 --> 28:00.433
I'd go to interview,
but I'm precluded for pecuniary reasons.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.389
Money of late's been
a motivating factor in my life.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.119
Well...

28:06.440 --> 28:08.272
...be that as it may...

28:08.440 --> 28:10.557
...positions are filled.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.117
Look, I'm well worth having in this thing.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.351
I have no doubt of that.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.591
Because there's something
to be fired up about.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.759
We are, believe me.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.800
Ah. Well, I'll, um...

28:29.080 --> 28:31.754
...go through William's Rolodex.
Thank you, uh...

28:33.280 --> 28:34.600
...for your time.

28:38.040 --> 28:41.078
You know, if you're interested
in volunteering...

28:41.280 --> 28:43.237
...we're having a meeting next week.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.710
Uh, we could use someone
with your legal expertise.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.874
- Perhaps you could give a talk.
- I'd like that. Here's my card.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.993
I crossed out the office address.

28:54.160 --> 28:58.518
And I wrote my home address,
so you can reach me via mail.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.034
I'll probably just text you.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.669
I can do that, I think.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.151
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.674
Right on.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.032
What a freak.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.840
You stand on his shoulders.

29:27.640 --> 29:32.476
<i>Good afternoon. Yeah,
my name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire.</i>

29:32.640 --> 29:34.632
<i>Yeah, Israel. Yes.</i>

29:34.800 --> 29:37.110
<i>Yes, like the... Like...
Yes, right, exactly.</i>

29:37.280 --> 29:41.160
I'm an attorney, civil-rights attorney.
I was inquiring about a possible job...

29:41.320 --> 29:42.674
Uh, yes, ma'am.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.633
Right, if I... If...

29:44.840 --> 29:47.071
<i>Right, if I had a job,
I wouldn't be calling you.</i>

29:47.240 --> 29:49.391
<i>That's why I'm calling.
I don't have... Hello?</i>

29:49.600 --> 29:53.594
<i>- -C-K-S-O-N. And I'd like to speak to
someone about any possible positions...</i>

29:53.760 --> 29:55.080
<i>Yeah, I'll reach out again.</i>

29:55.240 --> 29:57.800
<i>In case any jobs come up,
I'd appreciate a call back.</i>

29:57.960 --> 30:00.714
<i>Yeah, good morning.
My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire.</i>

30:00.880 --> 30:02.075
<i>I can send you my résumé.</i>

30:02.240 --> 30:04.960
<i>I was with William Henry Jackson.
I'm hoping to find out...</i>

30:05.120 --> 30:07.077
<i>...if there's an employment opportunity...</i>

30:07.280 --> 30:09.033
<i>No, not the number that's crossed out.</i>

30:09.240 --> 30:13.632
<i>It's the number below the number that's
crossed out. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.</i>

30:22.040 --> 30:23.599
<i>Um, Mr. Israel?</i>

30:23.800 --> 30:26.599
<i>George Pierce would like you
in his office right away.</i>

30:27.360 --> 30:29.750
The best thing to do is engage with the
process. Otherwise, you feel powerless.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.634
Come on in.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.232
I'd like you to meet Felicity Ellerbee.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.392
- Felicity, this is Roman Israel.
- Hi.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.956
He'll be working closely
with me on this. Sit down.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.589
Roman's a terrific attorney.
We're lucky to have him.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.275
Felicity's nephew Derrell was
arrested two days ago...

30:45.440 --> 30:48.672
...in connection with an armed robbery
during which a clerk was killed.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.436
Derrell's been charged with assault,
first-degree murder.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.593
It was his friend that was there with him.
It wasn't Derrell.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.036
Derrell didn't know
that he was going to do that.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.919
Of course. We completely understand.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.878
Derrell was not the shooter.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.670
It's our job to prove how uncomplicit
he was in the actual murder.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.952
The way this will work is
Roman's gonna be the point person.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.999
And you were very, very wise
to retain private counsel.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.834
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Derrell's got a mountain to climb.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.798
It's imperative he receives
the best defense.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.357
I can promise you
that's what he'll get here.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.635
- I had to mortgage my house.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.190
- I don't like lawyers.
- Ha. Me either.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.720
I understand.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.270
If I don't get answers to my questions...

31:31.440 --> 31:33.033
...if I don't see results...

31:33.240 --> 31:35.914
...if I see padded shit popping up
in my bill...

31:36.120 --> 31:38.271
...I will fire your ass.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.672
I'm putting up my house.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.638
I understand.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.957
You always dress like that?

31:47.160 --> 31:49.117
Uh, well, uh...

31:49.840 --> 31:53.072
...in lieu of wardrobe, I have a reputation
as a dedicated advocate.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.232
Let me give you my card.
If there's any questions...

31:55.400 --> 31:57.232
...concerns,
anything you want to talk about...

31:57.400 --> 31:59.995
...free of charge, I'm here.
I'm available for you.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.594
It's not the crossed-out number.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.400
It's the number
above the crossed-out number.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.756
- What's "Esquire" mean?
- Uh...

32:06.920 --> 32:09.310
It's a designation, uh...

32:09.480 --> 32:10.709
...in the legal arena.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.792
It's like...

32:12.960 --> 32:14.394
...a title of dignity.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.792
Slightly above "gentleman,"
below "knight."

32:23.760 --> 32:24.796
Yes.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.640
Come in.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.152
Roman, I'd like you to meet James Lee.
Jim, this is Roman Israel.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.437
- He'll be working closely with me on this.
- Hi.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.710
Please sit down, Roman.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.109
Roman's a terrific attorney.
We're lucky to have him.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.758
Jim's wife Mari was cited last night
for felony DUI hit and run...

32:42.920 --> 32:45.435
...with added charges
for reckless driving and injury.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.559
The way this will work is
Roman's gonna be the point person.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.757
You were very wise
to retain private counsel.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.311
Mari's... She's gonna need,
and deserves, the best defense possible.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.870
We're gonna make sure
she gets exactly that.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.957
From George.

33:11.280 --> 33:15.194
It's then, per the night manager,
that Derrell's friend, Carter Johnson...

33:15.360 --> 33:18.080
- ...shoots the clerk twice in the head.
- Okay.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.200
They empty the register, roughly $500,
and then run into the alleyway...

33:22.360 --> 33:24.556
...where Derrell is caught
and Johnson escapes.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.394
Johnson is a shot caller
with the Rollin 100.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.395
He's got four outstanding warrants,
including two for prior shootings.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.120
- Now, your boy Derrell is...
- Don't use "boy."

33:34.960 --> 33:38.795
Your client is seen entering the store
on the outside camera...

33:38.960 --> 33:41.077
...but the inside video wasn't working.

33:41.240 --> 33:45.519
The Armenian Community Council
put up $100,000 for Johnson's arrest...

33:45.680 --> 33:47.717
...for the clerk, who was Armenian.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.716
Your client Derrell has two priors
going back four years.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.470
One for drug possession, marijuana,
and the other for theft.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.793
I have a domestic-violence case.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.158
This guy assaulted the same woman
six times, and she's swearing out...

34:04.320 --> 34:06.551
...an affidavit for non-prosecution.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.235
- Have you heard of Tempura House?
- No. What's that?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.795
It's a shelter
for lightly battered women. Ha-ha-ha.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.320
Ha. That's funny.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.708
That's funny.

34:19.199 --> 34:22.079
Turn on the light, they run like roaches.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.469
You work here?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.797
Yes, sir, I do.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.154
Jessie Salinas.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.437
Supervising attorney.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.480
Roman J. Israel. I'm the new guy.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.000
Did you just compare us to roaches?

34:40.679 --> 34:43.114
- There's no tiptoeing into this.
- We were blowing off steam.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.918
You're tourists.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.835
I'll see you around, Israel.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.835
Roman.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.596
Jesus.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.311
I heard about you today in the kitchen.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.597
Salinas is our number two.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.400
Not only that, you were schooling
Sanchez in a crowded elevator?

35:16.560 --> 35:18.711
Heh, that man doesn't
understand character evidence.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.155
Then find a quiet corner.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.876
I sent you an e-mail today
to come to my office.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.875
I'm sorry, but when people send e-mails,
they think it goes straight to your brain.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.000
You better take what I'm saying seriously,
because I'm being very sincere with you.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.675
You knew what you were getting
when you brought me in.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.911
Well, I thought you were functional.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.151
You brought me in
to put your feet to the fire...

35:38.360 --> 35:41.353
...because you're tired of treating
low-income clients like dollar signs...

35:41.520 --> 35:43.671
...and maybe you remember
what it feels like to care.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.753
- That's what I think, George.
- No, I hired you to make a buck.

35:46.920 --> 35:51.073
- Which is why I thought you took the job.
- I need money. Heh. Badly, of course.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.436
But what I really need, George, is an ally.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.920
I've been waiting to meet someone
of your high caliber.

35:57.080 --> 36:01.313
And, yes, I am selective. So, what I'm
offering to you right out here now...

36:01.480 --> 36:05.315
...is a chance to partner with me
on a piece of groundbreaking litigation...

36:05.480 --> 36:08.120
...I've been working on
for over seven years now.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.078
Inside this case is arguably...

36:10.240 --> 36:13.074
...the most important legal brief
in modern legal history.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.120
A sweeping federal challenge
that could yield nothing less...

36:17.320 --> 36:19.596
...than a grand new era of social reform.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.639
And I say that with all due competence.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.600
The Constitution guarantees us
a right to a fair trial...

36:25.760 --> 36:28.958
...but there can't be fairness
if 95 percent of cases never get heard.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.629
Criminal cases never get heard
by a jury or a judge.

36:31.800 --> 36:35.635
I am building
a wholly original class-action lawsuit...

36:35.800 --> 36:38.076
...with over 3500 names,
all former clients...

36:38.240 --> 36:40.596
...aimed at the heart
of plea-bargain reform.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.269
I'm talking about reforming
a system where prosecutors...

36:43.440 --> 36:45.352
...are trying to pull sentences
out of their hat.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.876
Where guilt or innocence is
being completely replaced...

36:48.040 --> 36:49.872
...by fear of having your day in court.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.590
Where people are being forced,
George, to plead guilty...

36:53.760 --> 36:57.754
...under the threat of overly harsh
and coercive sentences.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.800
It's a job for a legend,
or someone who wants to be one.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.629
- Let me tell you about it.
- No. Jesus, just stop.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.834
Roman, enough.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.231
Not speaking out...

37:11.280 --> 37:12.760
...is ordinary.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.594
We're agents of change, George,
each one of us.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.594
Now, I don't have the resources
to finish this on my own.

37:18.760 --> 37:22.390
But with your assistance,
I'm more than certain...

37:22.560 --> 37:25.314
...that we can finish this
and file it together.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.439
Partners on
a landmark class-action suit...

37:28.640 --> 37:31.075
...built on precedents and procedure...

37:31.240 --> 37:33.630
...and actual proof, weight of proof.

37:33.800 --> 37:34.950
I'm sure of it, George.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.557
Look, do you want this job or not?
Yes or no.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.030
- Yes.
- Well, then, you stop harassing people.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.879
You stick to clients,
you stick to memoranda only. That's it.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.599
Nothing else, under no conditions.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.318
Now, you have
any more pressing opinions...

37:49.840 --> 37:51.399
...you share them with me.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.791
Don't come in tomorrow without a suit.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.200
Okay.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.115
Driver's license,
California Bar card, visitor ID.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.515
Yes.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.514
I'm here to see Derrell Ellerbee.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.555
How they treating you?

38:35.280 --> 38:38.318
- You need anything?
- I need to get out of here.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.313
You understand the charges?

38:40.480 --> 38:42.995
Yup. They want to bury me.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.913
All right. From now on...

38:45.080 --> 38:47.879
...everything we discuss
will be confidential.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.034
I gotta be careful.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.439
- Is somebody threatening you?
- Look, I didn't shoot that guy.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.355
Okay? I just went in.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.631
I didn't know what he was gonna do.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.510
- You gave a statement to the police.
- Yeah, I asked for a lawyer.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.512
And before that...

39:04.680 --> 39:08.117
...after they read you your rights,
you continued to talk to the detective.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.080
They said you said...

39:10.520 --> 39:12.477
...that you saw Carter Johnson
with a gun.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.038
I didn't know he was gonna use it.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.476
Knowing he had a gun
when you entered the store...

39:17.640 --> 39:19.597
...that's aiding and abetting.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.513
Criteria for first-degree murder.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.674
CJ. CJ shot the clerk.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.276
All right? I saw it.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.073
- I'll testify if they let me out.
- They're not gonna release you.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.880
Case is too strong, charges too severe.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.398
Now, we can talk to the DA.
See what they'll offer for your testimony.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.519
Probation.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.792
Best you can hope for is a...

39:45.960 --> 39:49.032
...possible reduction
to second-degree murder.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.158
Right over here.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.199
Have a seat if you're so scared, man.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.756
Look, I know where CJ's holed up.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.679
Plus testifying.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.992
What's that worth?

40:09.160 --> 40:10.799
Worth a lot.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.636
The two combined can carry significant
weight. But you understand the risks?

40:14.800 --> 40:17.440
- What you're looking at?
- Yeah.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.314
I gotta be transferred
to protective custody first.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.438
This what you want to do?

40:24.560 --> 40:26.791
I don't want to...

40:26.960 --> 40:28.713
...but I will.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.799
Hello?

40:52.160 --> 40:55.392
- No one's supposed to be in here.
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

40:55.560 --> 40:57.870
I'm an attorney here, and I was looking...

40:58.560 --> 41:01.280
...for Mr. Pierce.
I wanted to talk to him about this case.

41:01.440 --> 41:05.400
He's in depositions all day. Mr. Salinas
is supervising attorney in his absence.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.759
- You'll have to leave.
- I'm sorry.

41:11.480 --> 41:14.120
I don't know why
they sent me this. I need more than this.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.710
- That's all we got.
- I don't want the summary.

41:16.880 --> 41:19.270
- I want the full deposition here.
- Okay.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.352
And what about tomorrow?
What's my agenda?

41:21.520 --> 41:23.477
- You're downtown all day.
- What is first?

41:23.640 --> 41:27.270
- Mr. Rutner at 9 a. m.
- I don't want to meet with him.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.231
<i>- Hello?
- Uh, hello.</i>

41:41.400 --> 41:43.312
My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire...

41:43.520 --> 41:46.194
...from the law offices of George Pierce.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.511
I represent Derrell Ellerbee.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.798
I'd like to speak to ADA Kate Becker.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.553
<i>Speaking.</i>

41:54.880 --> 41:57.952
Oh. Oh, okay. Uh, sorry.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.389
<i>- Uh, hi.
- Hi.</i>

41:59.560 --> 42:02.678
My client, Mr. Derrell Ellerbee...

42:02.840 --> 42:06.470
...is interested in discussing a deal.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.996
I have 40 open cases, so refresh me.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.594
<i>Right. Uh, uh, uh...</i>

42:11.320 --> 42:13.915
Convenience-store shooting. Um...

42:14.080 --> 42:17.710
An Armenian man was killed,
and, uh, there's a reward offered?

42:18.040 --> 42:19.554
Mm-hm. Okay, I have it.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.830
<i>The shooter...</i>

42:21.800 --> 42:24.520
...in this case, is a fugitive...

42:24.680 --> 42:26.160
...Carter Johnson.

42:26.320 --> 42:30.917
My client may know his whereabouts
and might be willing to testify.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.915
- He'll deliver on that?
- Well, that depends.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.074
If you waive all objections and appeal,
and he's willing to cooperate...

42:38.280 --> 42:40.078
...we'll drop the assault and kidnapping.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.796
<i>And we'll reduce murder one
to manslaughter, voluntary, 10 years.</i>

42:43.960 --> 42:45.599
Involuntary, three to five.

42:45.760 --> 42:48.832
No, a 21-year-old clerk was killed
in the commission of a robbery.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.269
It won't happen.

42:50.440 --> 42:54.912
Well, my client is giving you
the whole case at a great risk to himself.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.436
<i>- Let's discuss mitigating circumstances.
- Let's not.</i>

42:57.600 --> 43:00.911
Voluntary manslaughter, 10 years.
It's a good deal.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.159
It's an enema of sunshine.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.920
I don't have time for this.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.231
Well, I'm sorry for taking a nanosecond...

43:07.400 --> 43:09.915
...off of your assembly-line,
rubber-stamp existence.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.072
The People withdraw their offer.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.994
I don't care what the... Hello?

43:39.200 --> 43:40.919
Hi.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.833
- Hi.
- Hey.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.231
You didn't want to park closer?
There are spaces.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.596
No, I don't have a car.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.433
Wow, that's gotta be tough in L. A.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.479
I've always imagined life with one.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.950
- Thanks for doing this.
- Oh, you're welcome.

43:56.120 --> 44:01.070
Public speaking is something
I'm usually encouraged to avoid.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.240
So in anticipation of Tuesday's protest...

44:05.400 --> 44:08.313
...I've invited attorney...

44:08.480 --> 44:10.551
...Roman Israel...

44:11.000 --> 44:14.755
...to talk about our rights
and what to expect if you are arrested.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.310
Roman.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.516
Thank you.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.472
All right. Uh...

44:27.160 --> 44:29.550
Back to my beginnings.

44:30.200 --> 44:33.716
It, uh, feels good.

44:36.440 --> 44:40.354
Hell, that was 40 years ago.
So here we go. We're gonna...

44:40.760 --> 44:42.592
We're gonna rap...
I don't mean hip-hop.

44:45.160 --> 44:48.836
...a little while about
some good old-fashioned...

44:49.520 --> 44:52.991
...grassroots, in-your-face protesting.

44:54.360 --> 44:57.637
The time has come
to put social revolution...

44:58.240 --> 45:01.278
...squarely back on the agenda...

45:01.640 --> 45:03.279
...where it belongs.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.073
Look at you.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.152
Just like I was.

45:12.320 --> 45:17.031
Just starting out your fight against the...

45:17.800 --> 45:20.315
...dominant tendencies of our society.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.914
Well...

45:22.400 --> 45:24.869
...you better get ready
for the commitment it takes...

45:25.040 --> 45:27.509
...to lead a resistant lifestyle.

45:27.680 --> 45:29.558
You better start forging...

45:29.720 --> 45:32.997
...the armor to withstand the temptation...

45:33.160 --> 45:36.392
...and the financial and emotional toll.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.071
Because when it comes
to social injustice...

45:39.240 --> 45:41.232
...and judicial indifference...

45:41.400 --> 45:43.278
...and institutional racism...

45:43.440 --> 45:45.272
...and outright goddamn greed...

45:45.440 --> 45:49.593
...the overwhelming majority of the people
in this countryjust don't give a damn.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.717
- That's right.
- That's right.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.550
Civil or uncivil disobedience.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.758
The First Amendment to protect
your right to freedom of speech...

45:57.920 --> 46:02.039
...as long as you don't incite violence
or law-breaking.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.635
There will be people
that get caught up in the march.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.156
They're gonna vandalize.
Sorry. Excuse me.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.640
I see two sisters standing.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.789
Why are the sisters standing
and the brothers sitting?

46:13.120 --> 46:14.634
If we want to sit, we can ask.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.996
You ladies gotta speak up for yourselves.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.879
This ain't 40 years ago.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.791
There's no statute of limitations
on chivalry.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.600
- That's gendered and sexist.
- And polite.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.871
- And patronizing.
- And polite.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.879
What kind of law do you practice?

46:32.840 --> 46:35.833
I'm a criminal-defense attorney.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.117
Ever represent
domestic-violence defendants?

46:38.280 --> 46:39.475
Many times.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.031
- Knowing that they're guilty?
- Meaning what?

46:42.200 --> 46:43.680
Meaning you have a choice.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.833
Watch it. Someday you may need
the Sixth Amendment.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.354
Oh, that's lawyer talk.

46:49.520 --> 46:52.718
Oh, I see. So we got a Sarah Lawrence
soul sister in the band.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.794
- Ha-ha. I'm not your sister, asshole.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.475
- I'm not an asshole, sister.
- Hey, fuck you, brother.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.629
Settle down, okay? Thank you, Roman.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.957
- Okay.
- Did you bring something to help?

47:06.840 --> 47:08.274
Roman.

47:08.440 --> 47:09.954
Roman.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.075
I feel like I need to apologize for that.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.118
You don't. It's my fault. I say things.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.511
- Are you okay?
- No, I... Yeah, it's okay.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.480
It just got out of hand.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.553
My meanings seem to obfuscate
more than clarify.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.996
I mean, that's what the discourse is.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.038
- It's changed over the years.
- Right.

47:29.240 --> 47:30.560
- It's what we talked about.
- You did.

47:30.720 --> 47:34.191
- That's a lot of what this is about.
- I just can't seem to remove myself...

47:34.360 --> 47:37.398
...from what's happened in my life. I...

47:38.120 --> 47:39.679
This is where we are,
the way the world is.

47:39.840 --> 47:43.356
And I didn't even want to come out.
The nuns said I was a forceps baby.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.911
- Me too.
- Yeah?

47:47.080 --> 47:48.434
- No.
- No?

47:48.600 --> 47:50.432
Heh-heh. No.

48:03.560 --> 48:05.153
Is he okay?

48:06.080 --> 48:08.276
- I don't feel anything.
- Check his neck.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.753
No.

48:30.360 --> 48:31.510
What happened?

48:32.200 --> 48:35.989
- We just found him. I think he's dead.
- All right, don't touch anything.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.959
Man down, black male, 60 years of age.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.999
Not responding. Request RA.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.037
- What did I just say?
- He doesn't have ID.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.192
- What did you put in there?
- My card.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.119
Take it out.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.913
Well, without ID...

48:52.080 --> 48:54.720
...he'll get cremated and mixed up
with 1000 other homeless people.

48:54.880 --> 48:56.394
Take it out.

48:56.920 --> 48:59.640
It's just my name and number
for the coroner to call me.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.917
- Did you hear my partner?
- Okay.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.791
- Do what they say.
- I want to pay for the burial.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.390
- I'm not telling you again.
- I won't let him get swallowed up.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.517
I won't let him disappear,
completely forgotten.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.353
He most certainly was somebody.

49:30.520 --> 49:34.116
<i>All units.
Possible 187. Suspect there now.</i>

49:34.320 --> 49:36.630
<i>Western and Third
at Chinatown Express.</i>

49:36.800 --> 49:39.599
<i>Suspects are two male Hispanics.
Number one, large build...</i>

49:39.760 --> 49:41.353
I'm sorry.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.632
- What? That was unbelievable.
- I thought he had no pulse.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.792
- No one does that.
- Yeah, for good reason.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.997
Hey. Yeah, I stepped out.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.675
I'll be right back.

49:58.040 --> 50:00.077
- I have to get back.
- Yeah. Okay.

50:01.960 --> 50:05.032
- I'm gonna call you.
- Yeah, thank you. Me too.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.479
We have a problem.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.079
Come in.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.759
Close the door.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.230
Where did you get the idea
you could try and negotiate a plea?

50:45.680 --> 50:47.637
Who told you you could do that?

50:47.800 --> 50:50.679
To just ignore
what I emphatically told you?

50:51.360 --> 50:54.797
Derrell Ellerbee was stabbed and killed
this morning in general lockup.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.839
His aunt told me that Derrell requested
protective custody last night...

50:58.000 --> 50:59.912
...but was delayed
because the prosecutor said...

51:00.080 --> 51:02.436
...you pissed on her deal, Roman.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.752
That offer should, by law, have been
presented to the client, which it was not.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.435
As of now, you've exposed us
to a malpractice suit...

51:08.600 --> 51:11.354
...Roman, I would kill
to be on the other side of.

51:11.520 --> 51:16.151
You've had difficulty comprehending
my meaning, so I'll be very, very clear.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.040
As much as I wanna fire you, I can't,
as that could be construed...

51:19.200 --> 51:23.080
...as acknowledgment of wrongdoing.
So I'm gonna retain you, Roman.

51:23.760 --> 51:26.594
I'm gonna retain you,
and then I'm gonna fire you.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.592
If you attempt to quit
or you stop coming in...

51:28.760 --> 51:30.797
...I swear to God, I'll hit you
with a motion to recoup damages...

51:30.960 --> 51:32.633
...and I'll have you disbarred.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.113
We're done here.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.194
Yo, hey, man. Hey.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.671
Yo, man, I'm sorry
to bother you, man, but...

52:03.840 --> 52:05.638
Maybe you can help me out
with money or some...

52:05.800 --> 52:08.190
I mean, anything.
Look, you see where I'm at, man.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.317
All right.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

52:10.520 --> 52:11.874
Okay, man. I'm sorry.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.874
Look, I appreciate it, man.
Look, I know it's late.

52:15.040 --> 52:18.636
- I appreciate you helping me. Cool, man.
- Here's a couple tickets for the mission.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.273
Give me the iPod, man!

52:24.520 --> 52:26.637
- Give it to me. Come on.
- Get off me.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.839
- The iPod!
- I don't have any money!

52:29.040 --> 52:30.713
- Come on!
- You got the wrong guy!

52:30.880 --> 52:33.520
You got the wrong guy!

52:47.960 --> 52:50.270
You got the wrong guy.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.794
What?

53:31.560 --> 53:32.914
What?

54:20.400 --> 54:21.470
Well, well.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.752
Come over and sit.
He'll be glad you're here.

54:25.920 --> 54:29.391
- He's awake?
- No, but I believe somewhere he knows.

54:30.440 --> 54:33.080
He was so very fond of you.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.080
He looks a lot worse.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.072
It won't be long now.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.870
Last ripple of a mighty wave
washed ashore here.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.237
And left us high and dry.

54:44.400 --> 54:47.393
No, he didn't leave us.
He'll never leave us.

54:48.280 --> 54:52.320
I thought it was built on good ground...

54:53.160 --> 54:55.675
- ...but there's nothing under it.
- Roman, what's wrong?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.836
You're too near me to hear me.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.199
Can't you see? It's clear as crystal.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.471
- What?
- We filed the wrong brief...

55:04.640 --> 55:08.316
- ...in the wrong court to the wrong judge.
- What are you talking about?

55:08.480 --> 55:10.790
A world where everyone's feelings
are reciprocated.

55:10.960 --> 55:14.271
The capacity for everyone
to contribute. Come on.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.755
Freedom is something
you can only give yourself.

55:18.960 --> 55:20.440
That's nothing he agreed with.

55:20.600 --> 55:24.116
I don't have any time anymore.
I don't have time to waste.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.839
Trying to...

55:26.400 --> 55:29.711
...tell people not to sleep so tight.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.440
Telling people to turn around.
Toward what?

55:32.960 --> 55:34.633
Roman, sit down.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.110
There's no need anymore.

55:37.280 --> 55:40.034
The incapacity ceases with...

55:40.200 --> 55:41.953
...the cause that produces it.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.554
Roman, he can hear you.

55:43.720 --> 55:46.076
Well, that's what I came to say.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.352
Anyway, he...

55:54.160 --> 55:55.514
Anyway, he's gone, so...

55:59.080 --> 56:00.639
What he fought for...

56:00.800 --> 56:03.713
...what he takes with him,
that lasts forever.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.639
Eroding as it was conceived.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.435
What is wrong with you?

56:09.720 --> 56:11.393
You know,
there's a shop by the ocean...

56:11.560 --> 56:13.517
...that makes maple-glazed
turkey-bacon doughnuts.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.359
People sit under palm trees
and eat them...

56:15.520 --> 56:17.398
...while the breezes are blowing
and the dolphins are playing.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.239
I'm gonna go there.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.360
Roman, all right, sit down.

56:21.560 --> 56:24.519
- No. I'm gonna get one.
- No, no, sit down.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.319
Roman.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.196
Roman.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.476
<i>Hello?</i>

57:53.640 --> 57:58.635
Hello. I'm calling in... In reference
to the, uh, deceased store clerk.

57:58.800 --> 58:00.553
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

58:01.240 --> 58:03.391
The... Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm calling in reference...

58:03.560 --> 58:06.598
...to the... The shooter
of the deceased store clerk.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.592
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>

58:13.520 --> 58:14.556
Yes, can I help you?

58:15.080 --> 58:16.992
Yes, the...

58:17.680 --> 58:20.070
The man who did it,
I know where he is.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.199
<i>- I'm ready.
- Um...</i>

58:23.520 --> 58:26.354
Well, I'm calling about the reward,
the $100,000?

58:27.240 --> 58:30.278
You know the name of the suspect?
We've had a lot of false leads.

58:30.480 --> 58:32.199
Carter T. Johnson.

58:35.320 --> 58:36.800
<i>Where is he?</i>

58:36.960 --> 58:40.954
Well, the man who did it,
uh, I have an address.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.391
<i>The clerk was my nephew.</i>

58:43.920 --> 58:47.277
Listen, I'm not comfortable, uh...

58:47.440 --> 58:50.717
...identifying myself.
I have a mechanism to collect...

58:50.920 --> 58:53.913
...which, um, protects who I am.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.753
<i>You could just say where he is.</i>

58:55.920 --> 58:57.195
<i>Civic duty.</i>

58:57.360 --> 58:59.238
<i>Basic human dignity.</i>

58:59.400 --> 59:01.357
Look, this is an achievement for me,
okay?

59:01.520 --> 59:03.477
Not an inherent state of my existence.

59:03.680 --> 59:07.833
I want the money in cash
as soon as he's arrested, $100,000.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.434
<i>Can't do cash.</i>

59:09.600 --> 59:11.080
<i>Too risky.</i>

59:11.240 --> 59:12.833
I'm the one taking the risk.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.993
It's gotta be cash. That's the way it is.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.913
Okay. Fine.

59:19.800 --> 59:22.759
<i>I don't care who you are.
I just want the bastards caught.</i>

59:22.920 --> 59:24.593
Okay. Okay.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.353
<i>The reward stands.</i>

59:26.520 --> 59:28.352
<i>- Okay.
- Information leading to an arrest.</i>

59:28.520 --> 59:30.477
<i>- Okay.
- You want cash, I'll do cash.</i>

59:31.880 --> 59:33.837
<i>Give me the information.</i>

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.111
- You guys have a good day.
- Have a good one.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.395
- Good morning.
- Morning. Yes, it is. Good morning.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.473
Get three of your turkey-bacon
maple-glazed doughnuts, please.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.519
Three turkey-bacon maple.
Something to drink with that?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.594
Yes, the hibiscus-pomegranate cooler.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.032
Hibiscus-pomegranate cooler.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.279
Twelve dollars on the nose.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.920
Can you break 100?

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.434
Of course.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.358
Eighty-eight back to you.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.870
- Keep the change.
- Hey, thanks.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.034
- Those fit?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.079
- You think so?
- Trust me.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.391
Can I get you anything else today, sir?

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.994
A suit.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.196
Suits.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.431
Heh. Now we're talking.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.319
Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel.
Good afternoon. How may I help you?

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.834
Welcome, sir. Checking in?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.639
Roman J. Israel, Esquire.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.314
- Welcome to Loews.
- Thank you.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.997
<i>- It's a very nice suit.
- Thank you.</i>

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.473
Lynn went to your apartment
this weekend to speak with you...

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.393
...but you weren't there.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.155
Oh, I must have been out.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.159
You... You don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.197
- You're firing me?
- No.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.230
No. People became concerned
after you went to the hospital...

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.279
...Friday morning, and it was decided
after some discussion...

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.512
...that it was best not to leave a message
on your phone.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.235
William died.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.391
Oh. When?

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.190
Friday night, actually.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.995
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't kill him.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.875
There's gonna be a small private funeral
on Wednesday...

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.509
...and then a full memorial
in several weeks.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.955
Is that it?

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.759
I don't know what you're feeling...

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.430
...given how close you were.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.876
I mean, I guess...
I guess I can kind of imagine.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.072
Yeah. I put that behind me.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.676
Well, I'm sorry for my outburst
the other day. I was...

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:33.920
I was overly harsh.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.639
Lynn's been telling me
how vital you were to William's work.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.071
Always in the shadows,
never flagging...

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.393
...and I pulled you out of the back room and
forced you out onto the floor. It was...

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.231
It was a lot to ask.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.671
I've gotten Felicity Ellerbee
to sign a document...

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.877
...absolving us of any wrongdoing
in her nephew's death.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.111
It's a good thing that she...

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:59.035
She believes that you were just acting
in Derrell's best interests.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.078
So that's in the rearview.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.518
I've also learned today
that we picked up...

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.354
...three new clients, all of whom came
as referrals from your cases.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.274
It seems like your personal attention,
giving out your cell phone...

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:10.760
...is quite the calling card.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.354
I wanna institute the practice
for all our attorneys.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.840
Good.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.037
Look, you can still leave, of course.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.796
I fully understand. I think maybe there's...
Maybe there's a place for you here if you...

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.519
- I wanna stay.
- You would?

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.948
Yes.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.557
I mean, I'm tired of doing
the impossible for the ungrateful.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.633
I now have, uh, more...

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.990
...practical concerns.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.113
The suit's a big change.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.519
Thank you.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.876
I prefer double-breasted, but, uh...

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.555
- You broke open the piggy bank, huh?
- Yeah. Yes, I did.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.398
My lack of success is self-imposed.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.555
So, Israel, there's a rumor
that you know the CPC by heart.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.154
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.036
- Pleadings.
- Nine forty-eight, 973.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.759
- Demurrer for irregularity.
- Twelve forty-eight.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.990
Money laundering.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.916
186.9, 186.10.
However, all pleadings in those cases...

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.915
...are subject to the laws
of joinder and severance. That's 954.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.719
- Wow, impressive.
- Nice.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.152
Heh. You gotta be kidding me.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.714
I gotta go.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.792
See you, Jessie.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.758
Listen, um, I got a Prop 36
I could really use help with.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.555
Okay.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.110
We handled a lot of DTC motions
at my old firm.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.476
Awesome. I have some free time
this afternoon, if you do.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.314
I don't know what your caseload is like,
but I'll stop by?

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.630
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.796
So where do you currently live?

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.838
Further away.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.076
Well, if you lived here,
you'd be home by now.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.678
Well, what do you think?

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.518
I think that whatever we're chasing...

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.072
...you got it all here.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.080
- I'm sorry?
- When can I move in?

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.039
- Immediately.
- I'll take it.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.915
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, hey. It's, uh... It's Maya.</i>

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.516
Hi.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.555
- How are you doing?
- Wonderful.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.598
Good. I, uh...

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.992
I meant what I said last week
about staying in touch.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.277
How's the new job?

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.190
I'm writing lengthy interrogatories...

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.069
...and amending complaints.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.876
<i>It's no social-redeeming quality
or context.</i>

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.793
You know, it's...

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.917
It's awesome.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.400
Okay.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.792
Well, I was calling to see
if you wanted to go for dinner.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.996
With me?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.273
<i>With you?</i>

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.029
I'm confused.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.953
I... I'd like that.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.634
I'd like that.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.156
<i>- I'd like that, yeah. Um...
- Great.</i>

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.436
Tonight? I mean...

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.034
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.032
<i>- Works for me.
- It works for me.</i>

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.840
Tonight works for me, but, I mean...

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.071
All right. I'll... I...

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.194
Tomorrow. I'll do tomorrow.
We'll do tomorrow.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.319
Okay. I'll see you then.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.914
<i>Bye.</i>

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.149
Everybody in?

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.038
All right, let's get started.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.551
Under the new fee structure,
our advance on felony cases...

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.677
...rises from 2000 to 2500.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.110
Our felony daily rate rises
to 1500 from 1000.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.352
Now, of course, some people are
gonna gag at the new numbers...

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:11.638
...but what we're selling is
our impressive win-loss record...

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.638
...our depth of talent,
all you fine people...

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.230
...and, ultimately, our lower all-in costs.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.550
Take time to explain it.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.150
If you see a potential client heading
for the door...

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.279
...you emphasize
our new personalized approach.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.511
All right, I've also decided to devote...

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.240
...a share of our time to pro bono.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.240
Now, that's not an area
we have much experience with...

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.352
...but someone here does.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.239
It's the first he's heard about it...

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.030
...but Roman will be heading up
our new pro bono program.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.199
Roman, you want to say a few words?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.433
Will this cut into my salary?

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.397
I mean, in terms of billable hours?

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.237
- Okay.
- All right. Heh.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.837
Connor, you'll be assisting Roman.
I want to get moving on it right away.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.390
Folks, take a look.
It's already in the new brochure.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.432
All right, questions?

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.239
Nothing? Good.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.633
- Roman, I didn't dress for this place.
- Oh, there's no code.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.632
It's a bit uncomfortable for me.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.075
You don't like it?

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.550
This will cost a fortune.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.030
Well...

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.510
Yeah. We deserve it.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.996
You know,
I really heard what you said...

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.038
...the first time you came in.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.672
About progressive lawyering being
the cornerstone of modern activism.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.314
Particularly given the tunnel
that we're descending into.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.071
You, the few lawyers like you...

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.913
Thank you.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.878
You really took up the mantle
of leadership with your own advocacy.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.158
You're out there...

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.875
...and alone for so many years.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.592
I feel like...

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.555
I don't know.
I feel like I was meant to meet you.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.996
Ah.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.518
- Thank you.
- I've been going through...

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.040
...my own struggles.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.231
You know, trying to balance what I do...

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.996
...and the sacrifices.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.716
I've asked myself many times,
"Why do I see things...

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.270
...so differently from other people?"

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.518
You know, why...?

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.994
Why do I care so much that our humanity
is connected to each other?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.836
I have moments...

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.710
I have extended periods of real doubt.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.838
I'm just holding on by a thread.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.798
So, uh...

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.952
...hearing you...

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.511
...and, um, understanding
what you've been through...

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.077
...and... Thank you.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.636
Just knowing you.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.799
I mean, honestly,
Roman, you're inspiring.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.749
I've never had it before...

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.078
...but I imagined Duck à l'Orange
to be different somehow.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.000
Jesus, I'm being serious.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.712
Perhaps you need to look
at things differently. You all right?

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.714
- How?
- Well...

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.071
...the world is for wonderful things,
isn't it?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.516
Define "wonderful."

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.749
Okay. As an example...

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.352
...who says...

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.752
...you can't steal a car in self-defense?

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.115
In reference to what?

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.076
If one required a means of escape,
so to speak.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.879
Escape from what?

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.393
Possibility to actuality.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.960
I mean, it follows. The logic is valid,
thus the premise is true.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.080
Every weapon is a tool
if you hold it the right way.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.879
You're saying to justify something?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.032
I'm saying...

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.678
...purity...

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.555
...can't survive in this world.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.480
Living conditions have bearing.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.474
I'm talking about the burden of activism.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.960
Exactly.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.271
What are you talking about?

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.671
My ears are ringing.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.077
It's somebody's phone.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.433
Roman.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.999
It's very difficult to be truthful.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.551
Not just with principles...

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.949
...but with yourself.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.511
To admit that you want something else
and to try and act on it.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.275
But I don't want something else.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.440
I feel blessed to believe in something.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.798
The way you do.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.232
Thanks for dinner.
That was very generous.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.835
The portions were small.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.991
I'm moving into a new place
in a few days, after 35 years.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.040
- You're going through a lot of changes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.557
- Kind of worried I'll miss my old place.
- Maybe you should wait until you're sure.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.434
Nah, signed the contract.
I can't go back.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.553
- I called a car.
- Already got you one.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.031
See, I can Uber and text. It's right here.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.276
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.918
I just want you to know
how much you've helped me...

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.390
...by, uh, meeting you.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.392
For what you do.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.199
- Your hair looks great.
- Thank you.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.558
William lived on grand notions...

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.236
...influenced by impractical ideas...

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.550
...in a house trembling with promise
and shouts of triumphs yet to come.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.232
Imploring and inspiring.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.830
A believer that the moral arc
of the universe is long...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.595
...but bends towards justice.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:18.272
He ignited a spark
in each and every one of us...

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.637
...and that light can never die.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.751
We have over 1000 attending
the memorial.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.630
Yeah, and not one of them returned
his calls when he was alive.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.871
I think it would be great if you spoke.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.872
Heh. And tell them what?

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.351
- You two talk the same language.
- Yeah, no, thank you.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.318
- If it's nerves...
- It's not.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.200
- There's no one more deserving.
- They wouldn't wanna hear it.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.476
Hear what?

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.951
The real enemies aren't on
the outside. They're within.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.033
We'll talk soon.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.520
I'll call you.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.552
You take care of yourself.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.870
I am.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.911
I disbelieve that.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.480
I'll be in touch.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.152
Roman, I'll see you at the office.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.476
I have something for you.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.350
No, you're right.
That 2500 is higher than average.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.399
But let me direct you
to our firm's win-loss record...

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.519
...our lower all-in costs,
personalized service.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.191
- It's all there in the brochure.
- I don't know.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.116
You're wise to price shop.
Very, very wise.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.317
When it comes to defending
your loved ones...

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.230
...there's a lot of people in prison
that would attest that that's a bad idea.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.799
We're going to do it.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.080
Okay.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.279
<i>Tickets for this week's game...</i>

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.797
<i>...available now on the main concourse,
right behind Aisle 14.</i>

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.872
Man, you've had
some crash course, huh?

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.793
From William Henry Jackson
to George Pierce?

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.433
What a ride.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.354
You seem to be settling in okay.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.115
From all appearances.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.880
I got a lot of plans, Roman.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.511
I mean, nothing we have to get
too deep into here, understand...

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.354
...but down the line,
there is a lot I'd like to discuss.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.070
I'm gonna want your thoughts.
You know, closer community contact...

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.150
...taking on more family
and housing cases...

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.516
...setting up alternative
work arrangements.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.912
All while actually increasing
productivity and retention...

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.549
...which is not to suggest
it's about drumming up business.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.639
I mean, something's gotta get you up
in the morning, right?

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.832
And going back to William Henry...

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.151
...I told you I remember quotes
from his class.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.360
"I believe because of my beliefs."

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.240
I was gonna leave law...

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.916
...before I took his class.
After him, I doubled down.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.954
You know, all his talk of what could be
and the difference...

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.753
...one man could make.
But then you gotta make a living.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.957
Four offices, this market?

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.478
It's... It's no small thing.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.712
Of course, he didn't see it that way.
He told me I was, uh...

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.355
I was drowning in the shallow end.

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.951
Worse was, I knew it.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.399
And then you come along, you...

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.637
You shake things up a bit,
and here we are sitting...

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.520
...talking new possibilities,
where we can go.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.237
Hell, I don't have to explain. You get it.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.796
Christ, you're gonna be
right in the middle of it.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.109
- Come on, man.
- That's bullshit.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.553
Whoo. L. A. traffic, man,
there's no getting around it.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.439
Glad I caught you before we came in.
We just landed this.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.592
It's a capital case.
You have experience with those?

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.035
We handled quite a few.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.034
I'll make the introduction,
then I'll bow out and you'll stay.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.395
Okay.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.598
I looked at that prison-overcrowding case
you and William worked on.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.996
- Which one?
- This one was against Men's Central.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.516
- You prevailed.
- Oh, that was overturned.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.154
Yeah?

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.960
- How's your big plea-reform brief going?
- Uh...

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.310
Put it aside.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.637
Well, tell me more about it.
I'm interested.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.955
Carried it as far as I can take it.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.919
Well, how about some help?
I mean, I've been thinking about it.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.117
I've become less skeptical
about the possibilities...

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.835
...and scope of what you said.
I could devote office resources...

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.595
...help you complete the brief. We could
file it at the federal court together.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.878
That's the first step. It'll take years
of commitment to see it through.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.470
Commitment doesn't seem
to be a problem for you.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.359
I hear you're moving
to a new apartment.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.671
- How'd you hear that?
- Payroll check comes across my desk.

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.600
- I know that building. It's not cheap.
- I had money saved.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.712
I mean, it's great. It's a nice building.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.156
No, I mean,
I had money saved for a long time.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.312
- Well, what else is it good for?
- Heh.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.199
- You got your ID?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.430
George Pierce and Roman Israel
to see our client, Carter Johnson.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.478
- Carter Johnson?
- I meant to tell you.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.996
They picked him up on Friday
from the Ellerbee case.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.310
We've been retained.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.433
Hello, Carter.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.235
I'm George Pierce, and this is
my associate Roman Israel.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.790
Roman is a devoted advocate
and a fabulous attorney.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.680
And he's gonna be
the point person on your team.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.920
- You're good, huh?
- Well, he's better than good.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.436
Have you had a chance
to review the fee structure?

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.512
- The stuff you sent over? Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.080
You understand this is
a capital murder case?

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.313
- Yeah.
- All right, first off...

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.312
...you wanna be fully up to speed
on your file.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.154
You will make better decisions
if you're completely informed...

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.835
...about every aspect of your case
and you know all your options.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.997
I know all my options.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.597
Well, unfortunately, we, uh,
can't change what's been done.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.110
That means facing this head-on.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.352
I think you understand the penalties
you're facing are very severe.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.436
In overview,
we're gonna study the discovery...

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.313
...of the evidence
the prosecution gives us.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.153
And we're gonna force the prosecution...

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.118
...to give us anything
and everything we want.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.237
- Roman, you wanna step in?
- Yeah, we're gonna...

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.514
We're gonna perform
a private investigation...

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.594
...and devise a defense.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.714
That's not all we'll do.
We'll outwork the prosecution.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.918
All right? We're gonna outwork them,
we're gonna outperform them.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.760
And we're gonna get you
the best result possible.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.197
- Life in a cage.
- Well, that's the outcome we're fighting.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.400
It'll be a long process,
and it's gonna cost quite a bit.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.914
So with that in mind, I...

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.595
I'd like to suggest there's no need
for two billable attorneys...

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.510
...at this early phase. If it's okay with
you, I'll bow out. I'll let Roman continue.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.319
It's okay with me.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.233
All right, Carter.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.557
I'll be in touch.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.189
- Roman, I'll speak with you later.
- Okay.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.953
Guard.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.236
The, um...

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.034
Um...

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.718
The prosecutors are gonna favor
a grand jury...

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.352
...over a preliminary hearing,
which will allow them to wait...

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.752
- ...and reveal the evidence at the trial.
- You represented Derrell.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.399
Briefly.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.158
I asked for you
after talking to his cellie.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.395
We have a number
of legal maneuvers we can employ...

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.639
...to try and force a prelim.

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.872
- I don't care about the prelim.
- I'd advise that we pursue it.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.920
You knew where I was.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.309
When was that?

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.795
Before they picked me up.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.555
I'm sure Derrell shared that info
with a number of people.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.559
No.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.673
You're the only person he told.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.876
That's what he told the guy.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.556
You called it in,
collected the reward money.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.874
- You fucked me.
- I presented myself...

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.675
...on your request for an attorney.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.436
You're talking,
but it don't mean nothing.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.197
I ain't never getting out of here.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.636
They got me cold.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.236
But I'll tell you this.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.197
I got you.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.915
Anytime I want.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.560
- Guard... Guard.
- Any place.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.598
- Guard!
- Could've already done it.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.717
- Guard.
- But I want you to be where I am.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.599
- Guard!
- Thinking about it.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.355
- Guard.
- Go on and tell somebody what you did.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.352
- I want out.
- Broke your own law.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.113
- Privileged information.
- Guard!

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:40.109
Tell them about the law you broke.
They'll throw you in here with me.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.879
What, you gonna run? Try it.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.270
Hello?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.640
Hello?

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.636
<i>- Front desk.
- Yes, I just received a call, uh...</i>

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.838
<i>- There was no one there.
- Well, they asked for you, Mr. Israel.</i>

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.514
Did they give a name?

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.990
<i>I'm sorry. No, they didn't.</i>

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.593
Hello?

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.034
H ey!

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.670
Hey, you okay?

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.750
You all right, mister?

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.397
I was running.

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.957
You need any help?

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.960
It was a bad decision.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.595
- It wasn't my first.
- Dude's crazy.

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:55.516
Come on.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.954
<i>- Hello?
- Hey. It's Maya.</i>

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.760
<i>- Hi, Maya.
- What are you doing?</i>

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.519
Uh...

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.992
<i>- Nothing much.
- You'd tell me if I was bugging you.</i>

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.072
<i>- No.
- Heh-heh.</i>

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.515
<i>Well, that's honest.</i>

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.999
<i>You know I only call you
when I'm down. That's horrible, right?</i>

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.038
<i>One of my friends...</i>

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.590
<i>One of my best staffers
quit on me yesterday.</i>

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.434
<i>Told me that working here
was just for his résumé.</i>

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.160
Oh. The ability to have...

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.398
...conflicting ideas
in one's head takes effort.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.438
<i>Huh. I like that.</i>

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.080
<i>How's your day going?</i>

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.919
Oh, you know...

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.760
<i>- ...life smiles, I smile back.
- Heh.</i>

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.311
<i>- You don't sound like you're smiling.
- I'm a little...</i>

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.473
<i>- Kind of anxious, actually.
- Well, just tell yourself...</i>

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.951
<i>...that most of the things you worry about
will never, ever happen.</i>

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.999
<i>- I'll try that.
- Alcohol works even better. Heh.</i>

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.680
<i>- Roman?
- Yeah.</i>

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.230
<i>It's a really bad connection.
Where are you?</i>

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.312
In a desert.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.359
<i>Yeah, it feels like that sometimes.</i>

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.353
<i>Just gotta keep moving.</i>

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.199
Well, which way?

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:32.154
<i>Head on. Just straight through. Heh.</i>

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.756
<i>- Hello?
- Roman?</i>

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:38.515
<i>- Hey, can you hear...?
- Hello?</i>

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.273
Maya?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.117
<i>As social action
affects the course of law...</i>

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.192
<i>...let's call to account
the original complaint.</i>

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.829
<i>We're agents of change,
united by virtue...</i>

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.516
<i>Wrongs will be righted. A loophole
of ambiguity in the system...</i>

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.598
<i>Legal challenge
based on improvement...</i>

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.355
<i>Revised draft of a new community
unevenly applied...</i>

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.314
<i>For a verdict of history,
formally empowered with authority.</i>

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.479
<i>- -levers of the law. There needs
to be a bottom-up legal change.</i>

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.314
<i>Who'll see us?
What the world could be, not what it is.</i>

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.551
<i>Society is something to be invented,
not endured.</i>

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.837
<i>...must stand, or go down together.</i>

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.433
Hey, Roman.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.514
What are you doing?

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.591
<i>Case 00-001.</i>

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.360
<i>versus himself, defendant.</i>

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.874
Hey.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.636
I just heard something disturbing
about you from a solid source.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.713
About the Ellerbee case.
Carter Johnson?

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.395
You collected the reward?

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.630
<i>- Is that true?
- ... in the city of Los Angeles.</i>

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.520
<i>- During that time...
- Roman.</i>

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.917
<i>for the above-mentioned request...</i>

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.551
<i>...for immediate and summaryjudgment.</i>

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.680
I thought we were working tonight.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.277
- Uh... I plan to leave.
- Monday, then? Tomorrow?

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.837
I believe I'll be unavailable
for the foreseeable future.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.673
You know the facts.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.593
- Just jump in.
- You mean, on my own?

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.876
You got it.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.199
<i>- Did you check his office?
- That's what I'm saying, he left.</i>

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.238
<i>- When?
- A few minutes ago.</i>

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.959
Goddamn it,
he's not answering his cell.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.352
Just keep trying him
and let me know, all right?

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.311
Roman. Roman!

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.798
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm back. Heh-heh.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.194
- What is that?
- That's for you.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.397
- It's a bulldog.
- Amongst other things.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.718
- It's so real.
- It actually is alive.

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.954
Why are you giving it to me?

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.757
To take care of.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.952
- Heh. You're a trip.
- Well...

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.191
...you're worth having in this thing.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.432
Here. Put it up here.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.273
- Is it yours?
- For a while.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:37.717
- Well, then you should keep it, Roman.
- Well, I don't have room.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.758
- In your apartment.
- I gave it up.

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.155
Why?

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.789
- I'm going away.
- Where?

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.995
Wherever they send me. See,
something has occurred. Something...

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.275
I've just taken a career
which was certainly sincere and...

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.397
And well-intentioned
and launched it right into...

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.870
...the realm
of the truly transformational.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.680
I promise you that the attorney
that triumphs in this instance...

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.992
...won't be the one with the most
formal education or legal skill.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.992
Roman, what are you talking about?

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.516
Well, it's quite interesting, actually.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.273
- There you are.
- Hey, George.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.909
- This is Maya. Maya, this is George.
- Hey.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.992
- Hello.
- Maya...

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.680
...doesn't...

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.629
...overlook the vital things...

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.473
...like other people.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.076
And speaking for myself,
I'm thankful for that.

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.872
Roman tells me
that he really enjoys working for you.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.920
Yeah. George is a protector of rights.
That's truth...

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.197
- ...in advertising.
- I...

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.239
I need to, uh... I need to have a word
with you. Can we...?

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.676
- I was leaving anyway.
- You just got here.

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.240
Sorry, Maya, it's, uh...

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.600
It's important.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.911
This is funny. Just to think...

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.080
Three Mondays ago,
I didn't know either one of you.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.511
- Roman, I'm concerned about you.
- It's okay.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.399
George and I just need to...

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.190
- ...talk business matters.
- Yeah.

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.997
I believe...

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.750
...the two of you are gonna...

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.636
...get along very well.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.553
Roman...

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.080
Roman.

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:20.637
Roman, wait.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.313
Roman...

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.437
...what the hell is going on?

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.394
From my point of view?

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.200
I get a call from Fritz.
Says he has reliable information...

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.034
...that you turned in Carter Johnson
and collected the reward.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.159
- Here's what the prosecutor won't tell you.
- Jesus Christ, it's true.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.595
I've been given a gift, George.

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.673
No, you acted utterly improperly.
I mean, you broke the law.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.270
- It so wasn't a gift, Roman.
- I'm not talking about the money.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.000
I don't care about the money,
fruit of the poisonous tree.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.879
If you wanna understand
what's happening...

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.272
...you're gonna have to get past
all the smoke of legal disputation.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.274
Legal disputation?
Roman, these are dangerous people.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:06.354
- You don't just walk away from this.
- Not walking away.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.519
I'm turning myself in.
The station's on Sixth.

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.594
Roman.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.911
I'll... I'll walk with you.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.473
You know,
all those years of practicing...

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.394
...scouring law books...

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.839
...achieving technical triumphs
through loopholes and ambiguities...

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.992
...none of which were adequate
to save me...

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.870
...from the reality of my present situation.
Then today, in the middle of nowhere...

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:46.033
...lost, had a revelation.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.194
An insight so sweeping, so clear.

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.433
It's me, George.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:56.150
See, I didn't see it before because
I never experienced the other side.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.953
I'm the defendant...

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.999
...and the plaintiff simultaneously.
I file against myself...

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.876
...I represent myself, I convict myself,
hereby expanding...

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.879
...the full scope of the legal desert,
because the judgment's built in.

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:12.393
The only thing left is forgiveness,
and I grant that to myself.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.837
An act doesn't make the person guilty
unless the mind is guilty as well.

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.073
Of course... Of course I expect
there'll be challenges...

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.550
...as there's no precedent...

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.474
...or derivative interpretations...

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.678
...but the argument is sound.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.910
The premise true. I have no doubt it'll
be upheld by any and all courts of law.

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.833
You're insane.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.275
- Never been more clear.
- That's what we'll argue.

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.556
Now, watch what you say.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.872
You don't represent me, so the rules
of confidentiality don't apply.

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.037
My entire defense will be based on
the unequivocal recitation of the truth.

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.835
I know you get it, George.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.198
You have such a tremendous future.
It's so bright, I...

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.352
I swear, it's...

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.349
Heh. It's blinding.

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.512
Jesus.

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.880
Hello?

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:53.076
Of course I remember you,
that's why I gave you my card.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.475
I... I like the idea
of starting the conversation...

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:06.270
...with how protest is
still relevant or not...

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:12.630
...because, you know, we approach these
things with, um, a certain tradition...

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.033
...a certain, you know, uh,
repetition of behavior...

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.274
...and sometimes thinking through it,
we have to find new approaches.

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:33.313
<i>To whom it may concern...</i>

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:36.230
<i>...I'm returning the reward money.</i>

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.633
<i>Taking it was wrong, and I'm compelled
to remedy my mistake.</i>

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:46.910
<i>I did spend $5,547.27,
which I will repay.</i>

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.676
<i>I bought three suits, size 50 regular.</i>

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.151
<i>And I did buy two pairs
of Italian loafers, size 11.</i>

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.472
<i>One black, one brown.</i>

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.596
<i>We are all formed of frailty...</i>

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.353
<i>...and error.</i>

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.319
<i>Let us pardon, reciprocally...</i>

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.278
<i>...each other's folly.</i>

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.475
<i>That is the first law...</i>

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.399
<i>...of nature.</i>

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.080
I'm filing a federal
brief in District Nine.
