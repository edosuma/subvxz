WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.412
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.744
Why are we searching
for this planet?

00:04.839 --> 00:07.831
Crichton:
Jool told us every few cycles,
the magnetics drop low enough

00:07.925 --> 00:10.086
for the dig team to remain
there for a while.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.590
D'Argol

00:12.680 --> 00:15.888
Three of these probes, which
form the Darnaz Triangle,

00:15.975 --> 00:17.966
were launched by enemies
ofpeace.

00:18.060 --> 00:22.178
Legend has it if I find the
third probe, I can reverse
its damage.

00:22.273 --> 00:23.183
This is Instructor Vella.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.265
A Carver can be perilous.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.564
Why didn't you stand up for me?

00:29.655 --> 00:34.115
If all the priests died here,
why are there no bones?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.317
(yells)

00:35.411 --> 00:38.198
See the Darnaz probes.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.575
( priests chanting )

00:43.544 --> 00:44.829
It's Peacekeeper code.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.331
What are you going to do?

00:46.422 --> 00:47.832
I'm going to warn the others
so they can hide.

00:47.924 --> 00:49.334
No!

00:50.343 --> 00:52.049
She's like in the wall?

00:52.136 --> 00:52.966
Peacekeepers.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.419
( groans )

00:56.682 --> 00:59.094
He'll never bother you again.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.013
What do you want from me?

01:02.104 --> 01:04.140
What I want...

01:04.232 --> 01:06.644
may not be as bad as you think.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.150
What are you doing?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.569
Whatever you want.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.863
Whatever. You can have it.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.566
Do you know where the
final probe landed?

01:16.661 --> 01:18.322
Yeah.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.279
Somehow I showed you...

01:21.374 --> 01:24.366
what you must not know.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.792
He has to die.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.255
Has to.

01:33.678 --> 01:36.795
He had to die.
He'll never tell you now.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.764
And now on Farscape.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.578
Peacekeeper
There he is. Over here.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.205
(weapons arming )

02:08.296 --> 02:09.331
Closer!

02:09.422 --> 02:10.628
(yells)

02:31.402 --> 02:33.017
Oo-nii:
You're with Grayza.

02:33.112 --> 02:35.103
You'll give her the
Darnaz Probes.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.279
Look, Grayza doesn't give
a rat's ass...

02:37.366 --> 02:38.776
I saw you with her.

02:38.868 --> 02:39.983
(grunts)

02:41.704 --> 02:43.569
(grunting)

02:43.664 --> 02:46.656
Grayza doesn't give a damn
about probes.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.161
She just wants what's
in my head.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.617
Vella was my friend.

02:49.712 --> 02:52.124
I'll not let you take what she
discovered.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.465
You'll not give it to them!

02:53.549 --> 02:55.164
(yells)

02:58.095 --> 02:59.005
(gasping)

02:59.096 --> 03:00.506
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

03:00.598 --> 03:03.806
I'm not gonna tell anybody
I saw where the probe is!

03:03.893 --> 03:05.099
You saw it?

03:05.186 --> 03:07.302
It's buried, but I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.306
Tell me where!

03:08.397 --> 03:10.433
Where is the final probe?

03:14.195 --> 03:18.108
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.942
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.822
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

03:23.913 --> 03:27.121
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

03:27.208 --> 03:28.948
my friends.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.830
I've made enemies.

03:31.921 --> 03:35.163
Powerful, dangerous.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.749
Now all I want is to
find a way home

03:38.844 --> 03:41.631
to warn Earth.

03:41.722 --> 03:46.807
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.206
D'Argo:
What are you doing?!

04:19.301 --> 04:20.882
I told you to find him,
not drown him.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.551
Now get off!

04:22.638 --> 04:24.219
(gasping)

04:27.810 --> 04:29.175
Oh!
-Here. What? Whoa!

04:29.270 --> 04:32.307
Back in the box for
you, my... Oh!

04:33.524 --> 04:35.606
What is with the stench?

04:35.693 --> 04:37.524
ldon't smell anything.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.351
Maybe that is the reason.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.438
Maybe that's the reason what?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.238
It could not be.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.452
D'Argo:
You know her. She starts
sentences, then she doesn't finish them.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.197
It's very annoying!

04:47.288 --> 04:48.494
The reason what?

04:48.581 --> 04:51.163
You know, you and Grayza
with the...

04:51.250 --> 04:52.410
You know about that?

04:52.501 --> 04:55.288
John, everyone knows.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.994
Oh, no.

04:57.089 --> 05:00.047
I must be wrong,
but Heppel oil?

05:00.134 --> 05:00.998
That's a myth.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.708
It would explain the smell.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.259
What are you guys talking about?

05:04.346 --> 05:08.680
Dellos concubines have a
gland implanted that
creates Heppel oil.

05:08.767 --> 05:13.602
lts perfume targets the
erogenous zones and
it makes you...

05:13.689 --> 05:16.476
Yeah, I know what it does.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.899
But Grayza would never
desire it.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.023
Why not?
-Well, its effects are
irreversible.

05:22.114 --> 05:28.110
Once the gland has been
implanted, the concubines die
cycles before their time.

05:28.204 --> 05:29.489
Yeah, she touched me.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.287
Aah, man!

05:32.374 --> 05:34.865
I'm not going anywhere
near that woman again.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.496
John, you have to see her
one more time.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.123
Screw you!

05:38.214 --> 05:39.795
Well, to use one of your
expressions,

05:39.882 --> 05:41.338
you're gonna have to
take one for the team.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.040
Technically, I've taken two.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.875
And now it's time
for the triple.

05:44.970 --> 05:49.179
Listen. She still has Jool and
Chiana, and we have a plan
to get 'em out.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.551
Yes?

05:50.643 --> 05:52.929
We are operating on a need
to know basis

05:53.020 --> 05:55.261
and we think it best that you
only know your part.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.721
Excuse me?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.771
Well, we feel if you know
the whole plan then...

05:58.859 --> 06:02.067
Crichton:
What, you... you two work it
out, and come up with a plan.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.066
Now you trust her and you're
not gonna tell me the plan?!

06:05.157 --> 06:09.776
Well, let me tell you. I do not
get back in the saddle
with Mata Hari

06:09.870 --> 06:12.156
until I get the whole plan.

06:12.248 --> 06:18.335
If you go back, can you be sure
Grayza will not make you tell
everything you know?

06:20.422 --> 06:23.334
You know it's the right
thing to do, John.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.006
Fine. What do you want
me to do?

06:25.094 --> 06:27.335
Okay. The Marauders are
prepping to go.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.930
We think they wanna
take you with them.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.723
You have to keep Grayza busy
for about two arns.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.643
From what we have seen,
that should not be too hard.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.562
Trust me, it'll be hard.
What am I supposed to
do in two arns?

06:38.649 --> 06:41.937
Just wait for my signal.
-Right.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.736
And John, when they find you,
it's gonna have to
be believable.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.235
You know, that you're hurt,
that you've taken a fall.
You can do that?

06:48.325 --> 06:50.737
I can fake that. I can fake it.
-Now, they have to...

06:50.828 --> 06:53.035
I said I can fake it.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.953
Okay, okay.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.873
Are you sure?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.325
I'm sure.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.375
Okay.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.622
( hisses )

07:01.714 --> 07:03.875
(laughing):
Oh, you best...

07:19.732 --> 07:21.347
He's alive.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.894
( grunts softly )

07:26.989 --> 07:34.327
Grayza:
I let you walk unguarded and you
repay me by trying to escape.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.199
I'm not Steve McQueen.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.828
I wasn't trying to escape.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.625
I thought someone was
throwing me off a cliff.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.841
Things like that are
fairly normal.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.299
( sniffs )

07:53.390 --> 07:57.975
You tell me why the Scarrans
want you so badly

07:58.062 --> 08:01.350
and I will find your love.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.896
Aeryn Sun.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.393
Aeryn?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.229
(gasps )

08:06.320 --> 08:07.275
Drink.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.823
I thought you were gonna get
Crichton to help us!

08:16.914 --> 08:18.700
He had to die. No other way.

08:18.791 --> 08:21.578
ldidn't think you were gonna
try and kill him, Wrinkles!

08:21.669 --> 08:23.500
We're all gonna die soon.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.036
Frata!

08:26.131 --> 08:27.996
(sighs)

08:28.092 --> 08:29.207
(giggles )
-Psst!

08:29.301 --> 08:30.416
What?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.126
The magnetics.

08:32.221 --> 08:35.133
You see how the colors are
fading from everything?

08:35.224 --> 08:36.430
The walls, your clothes.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.600
I never had much color
to start with, Princess.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.348
But don't you feel it?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.894
How you're getting hotter?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.517
(grunts)

08:44.608 --> 08:48.442
If we stay in here any longer,
we'll all be dead in ten arns.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.394
The flesh cooked off our bones.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.525
(laughing)

08:52.616 --> 08:54.026
Great!

08:55.327 --> 08:56.442
Just great.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.870
I am stuck here with the
suicide tralks.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.915
I'm not gonna let you
get me down.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.664
l... lam gonna to get
us out of this.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.165
(distant voices murmuring)

09:08.257 --> 09:10.464
(door opening)

09:10.551 --> 09:13.008
All right, who is in charge?

09:23.439 --> 09:24.895
Captain...

09:26.942 --> 09:30.230
I am your promotion.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.483
D'Argo:
Rygel, l'm docked. Meet me in
the Transport Hangar.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.111
If you can get Elack to crash
into the Marauders on
the planet,

09:36.201 --> 09:38.692
we might be able to escape
in the explosion wake,

09:38.787 --> 09:42.075
or at least far enough so the
Command Carrier can't track us.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.952
Crichton know about this plan?

09:44.042 --> 09:49.002
He may not wanna go along with
it, but we have no other option.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.296
Can you convince the old
Pilot to do it?

09:51.383 --> 09:56.503
I think so. No matter what,
she knows she's soon to die.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.134
You know why this plan is
going to fail?

09:59.224 --> 09:59.974
Rygel...

10:00.058 --> 10:01.594
Sikozu will betray us again.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.802
Do you really think you can
trust that female to
do her part?

10:04.897 --> 10:06.933
l have no choice.

10:07.024 --> 10:11.859
I know they're always out
there. In the sky.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.481
Waiting.

10:13.572 --> 10:20.193
If these wormholes are always
there, why can't they be seen?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.198
It's that...

10:22.289 --> 10:24.280
they're like this.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.955
Invisible.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.706
Sometimes, under the
right conditions,

10:29.797 --> 10:33.381
they turn and appear.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.344
| just don't know how to
make them appear.

10:39.431 --> 10:43.424
Grayza:
And do you think it's worth
risking your life... -Ma'am?

10:43.519 --> 10:47.137
...to find out about
these wormholes?
-Ma'am?

10:47.231 --> 10:48.971
Go away.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.977
Um...

10:51.068 --> 10:53.059
It's important, ma'am.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.863
I'm sorry to, ah,
disturb you, but...

11:01.954 --> 11:04.240
(whispering )

11:16.301 --> 11:18.007
Bring her.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.051
Bad news from Smithers?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.928
Your Luxan has failed.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.307
My soldiers are hunting
him down.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.854
He'll be dead in an arn.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.647
(grunting)

11:39.366 --> 11:40.606
(sighs)

11:40.701 --> 11:43.943
Don't fight me.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.154
(panting)

11:47.249 --> 11:51.413
Scorpy... Scorpy brief
you on this?

11:51.503 --> 11:54.540
You wouldn't do this.
Not on your own.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.247
Not this far away from
High Command.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.306
You're just his whore,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.927
doing what he tells you to do.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.471
Is that enough dirt out of
your hole, boss?

12:13.317 --> 12:15.399
Get out of there.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.735
Congratulations,
Peacekeeper whore.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.032
Perfect plan.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.405
One charge.

12:31.335 --> 12:35.954
You think Scorpius
is the brain?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.663
Go on.

12:37.758 --> 12:41.546
Kill the half-breed genius
and ruin everything.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.342
There's no charge in
that weapon.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.389
(gagS)

12:58.278 --> 12:59.734
(thud)

13:01.406 --> 13:02.395
( groans )

13:02.491 --> 13:04.573
(shrieks)

13:04.660 --> 13:06.571
Grayza:
Is he dead?

13:06.662 --> 13:07.868
Yes.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.071
Yes, I think so.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.405
Shoot her.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.074
What?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.409
I helped you!

13:15.504 --> 13:16.960
I told you about the Luxan!

13:17.047 --> 13:19.129
About his plan!

13:19.216 --> 13:20.797
Shoot the tralk, Braca.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.216
Give me a gun and I'll
do it myself!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.680
Scorpius:
Skernac.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.755
Say Skernac.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.134
It will save you.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.091
Sikozu:
Braca, wait.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.471
Skernac.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.514
What did you say?

13:36.608 --> 13:40.100
( shouting ):
Skernac!

13:43.156 --> 13:46.694
(weakly):
Do not let them bury me.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.443
Get her out of there.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.291
Get off me!

13:56.378 --> 13:58.869
How do you know
Special Directorate code?

13:58.964 --> 14:00.795
Sikozu:
Same way you do.

14:00.882 --> 14:05.546
And may I suggest, I would not
bury the half-breed.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.629
I would leave him out
in the sun to rot.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.261
It would scare the others more.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.767
ldon't think so.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.263
Bury him.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.821
Peacekeeper
Quickly!

14:34.583 --> 14:35.914
Okay, Rygel, I'm back
on the planet.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.662
Have you managed to
convince the Pilot?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.415
Yes, we'll wait for your signal.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.091
I'd better get a
Transport Pod ready.

14:47.179 --> 14:51.422
Yes. I'll wait half an em
then initiate de-orbit.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.306
You'll be able to target your
fall onto the Marauders?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.352
Off the Luxan's signal.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.180
Farewell, Dominar.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.644
Perhaps if our species share
the same afterlife,

15:04.738 --> 15:06.569
we will meet again.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.613
(inhales)

15:15.707 --> 15:21.543
My interrogations are much more
agreeable than Scorpius's
methods.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.337
Yeah.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.380
But I don't know anything else.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.459
I'm not scared. I've told
you everything.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.512
We don't only have to talk
about Scarrans.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.760
Squeeze the juice meat
out of it.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.011
You'll get a jolt. Wham!

15:36.103 --> 15:38.810
And for 500 microts,
nothing bothers you.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.263
Are you listening to me?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.393
Oh, yeah.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.274
Always a pleasure.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.155
What the frell does she want?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.491
Let me handle this.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.993
Thank you.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.252
Stay back, stay back.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.334
It's all right.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.761
| always wait.

16:12.848 --> 16:16.932
You know, see both sides.
Be reasonable

16:17.018 --> 16:19.760
But now, l have nothing to lose.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.437
Ah! Frell!

16:25.068 --> 16:26.854
Let...

16:26.945 --> 16:28.856
her go.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.983
I did not betray you.

16:31.074 --> 16:35.158
lam bluffing for all lam worth
just to get myself in here.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.452
Now. D'Argo has a plan.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.121
You're lying.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.039
We saw them not kill you.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.287
Why didn't they?

16:43.378 --> 16:46.415
They think I know some sort
of secret survivor code.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.124
What did you say to them?

16:50.218 --> 16:51.333
Skernac.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.793
What does it mean?

16:52.888 --> 16:54.879
l have no idea.
But it saved my life.

16:54.973 --> 16:59.933
And if you stop fighting me,
I will try and save yours, too.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.012
Why don't you put your
fingers in her ears?
(giggles )

17:03.106 --> 17:05.518
Stay still.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.436
(Jool screams)

17:21.708 --> 17:23.790
Thank you.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.852
Captain Braca, I think
I found something.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.227
(roaring)

17:52.322 --> 17:53.687
Ah!

17:59.287 --> 18:01.824
You found this tile here?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.200
Yeah.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.746
And this face is lnterion?

18:09.256 --> 18:10.712
I think so.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.215
And this face from your
home planet?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.135
I think so.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.464
Do you know what this means?

18:20.976 --> 18:22.967
Uh-huh.

18:23.061 --> 18:27.020
It means our two species may
be very closely linked.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.317
Which does not surprise
me at all.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.444
What's the matter?

18:44.291 --> 18:46.327
My back.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.627
It's all scratched.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.839
I can hear your heart.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.724
What's that?

19:09.733 --> 19:11.564
That's you.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.610
(speaking Luxan )

19:21.328 --> 19:22.864
Rygel,

19:22.954 --> 19:26.196
tell the Pilot to commence
countdown and start targeting
the Marauders.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.872
Will do.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.336
Hurry. We don't have
much time, DRD.

19:30.420 --> 19:34.163
( Pilot chanting )
-Pilot, l'm preparing the
Transport Pod to leave. Are you ready?

19:34.257 --> 19:35.793
What? What?

19:35.884 --> 19:36.873
Yes.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.209
I've talked with Elack.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.212
We are prepared.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.639
The DRD is almost done
fixing this,

19:44.726 --> 19:48.264
but we must start our descent
in a thousand microts.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.267
Yes. Go. Must go.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.724
Goodbye, my friend.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.524
You've served us well.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.352
Thank you, Dominar.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.405
Yes, must go.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.778
Must go now.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.284
Yeah.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.082
You like that.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.993
Mm-hmm.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.208
You like it like that.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.295
(giggIeS)

20:26.017 --> 20:27.678
Rygel:
Pilot, what's happening?

20:27.769 --> 20:29.725
I said a thousand microts.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.724
No, no, no, don't go yet.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.975
The Pod's not fixed.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.103
I'm still in the
Transport Hangar.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.438
D'Argo.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.611
Elack's left early.
He's coming now.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.530
Chiana, the Leviathan's
on its way down now.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.027
How long have we got, D'Argo?

20:44.119 --> 20:45.325
I'd say 400 microts.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.777
I'll signal Crichton.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.571
(comm beeping)

20:52.919 --> 20:54.455
What's that?

20:54.546 --> 20:57.504
Couldn't do it the old
fashioned way, could you?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.623
Six-pack of beer.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.130
Night of bowling,
skinny-dipping.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.836
Uh-uh.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.048
I hear you've been putting
some junk on the ball.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.225
Untie me.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.639
Little monkey,

21:12.730 --> 21:15.312
little Gaylord Perry,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.482
little Joe...

21:18.653 --> 21:20.189
Neikro.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.315
No.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.191
You

21:22.282 --> 21:23.897
stay.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.780
You never heard my heart.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.419
Crichton!

21:38.506 --> 21:40.167
Stay!

21:42.802 --> 21:45.214
(whispering ):
D'Argo. I got your signal.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.636
Crichton. Hurry!

21:46.723 --> 21:49.180
Where's your ship?
I'm on my way out of here.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.258
(weapons arming )

21:52.228 --> 21:53.889
Whoops.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.186
Hello, Crichton.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.107
Hiya, Braca.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.105
Let me ask you a question.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.484
You're a man of the
world, right?

22:04.574 --> 22:08.567
Does my ass look big
in these pants?

22:15.919 --> 22:17.079
D'Argo!

22:21.090 --> 22:23.217
Okay, I got a little
problem here.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.173
Rygel:
Pilot! Pilot!

22:28.264 --> 22:30.721
Pilot, stop your dive!

22:30.808 --> 22:32.014
Stop!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.056
You're too soon!

22:33.144 --> 22:35.009
I can't escape in the Pod yet!

22:35.104 --> 22:39.143
D'Argo:
John, Elack's crashing down
onto the Marauders now!

22:39.234 --> 22:42.021
The magnetics are playing havoc
with my system!

22:42.820 --> 22:44.481
So, that was your plan?

22:44.572 --> 22:45.982
Elack left early.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.689
Great plan.

22:50.203 --> 22:53.195
D'Argo, I need a little
help here!

22:54.207 --> 22:56.198
Crichton, where are you?

22:56.292 --> 22:59.125
I don't know. Near Vella's
chamber, maybe.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.124
Just follow the pulse fire.
-I know where that is.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.126
All right. Wrinkles, you go
find D'Argo's ship.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.959
Hey... hey, you!
You stay with us.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.135
Not that I don't trust you,
but I don't.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.587
Come on.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.474
(gun beeps)

23:19.566 --> 23:21.147
Damn!

23:21.234 --> 23:24.192
Come on, you are the most
powerful handgun in the
Uncharted Territory.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.442
Now I don't know if you fired
500 shots or 600, but...

23:29.409 --> 23:31.900
600. Empty.

23:31.995 --> 23:36.705
Damn you! Winona would never
do this because Winona
is very reliable.

23:36.791 --> 23:37.291
Hey, Crichton.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.036
Hey, hey.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.243
Jool, can I borrow that
pulse pistol?

23:41.796 --> 23:43.206
Go on.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.162
Thank you.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.246
(firing continues)

23:45.341 --> 23:47.252
a3i§iéé§§§2%*.l:§§

23:47.343 --> 23:49.550
Hey, what was that... what was
that word you used to get
out of the grave?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.923
Skernac.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.221
Both:
Skernac! Skernac! Skernac!

23:53.308 --> 23:55.139
Ah!

23:55.226 --> 23:56.966
Well, it was worth a shot.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.642
This way.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.807
Come on!

24:03.401 --> 24:05.517
D'Argo:
Chiana, Elack's almost
on top of us.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.227
We have to lift off now!

24:07.322 --> 24:08.607
We're on our way, D'Argo.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.313
Keep the engines hot.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.486
Braca!

24:13.578 --> 24:15.534
Uh, it seems they do have
a ship, ma'am.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.237
A ship?!

24:18.291 --> 24:20.247
Rygel:
Pilot, stop!

24:20.335 --> 24:21.541
( groans )

24:21.628 --> 24:24.244
D'Argo, we're dropping through
the granasphere.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.045
I can't stop Elack.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.168
Yes, ma'am, it was off
our scans.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.376
Captain, they must not escape!

24:33.306 --> 24:36.469
Sikozu:
D'Argo, we're here.
Where are you?

24:36.559 --> 24:39.471
D'Argo! Where's the ship,
fek-face?

24:39.562 --> 24:40.847
Wait! Wait!

24:40.938 --> 24:42.348
What?!
-What's that sound?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.681
We're too late.
It's the Leviathan.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.436
Crichton:
Back inside.
-There's no point in running.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.519
It is too close.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.480
There is always a point
in running.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.111
Rygel:
Pilot.

24:54.202 --> 24:57.569
Pilot, wake up.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.454
Dominar, why are you
still aboard?

25:03.544 --> 25:05.330
Oh, you left early.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.752
We need more time.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.000
It may be too late.

25:09.092 --> 25:13.085
We must pull up. We must try.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.840
( roaring overhead )

25:16.849 --> 25:17.554
(all exclaiming)

25:17.642 --> 25:19.052
(gasps )

25:22.146 --> 25:23.556
(all gasp)

25:23.648 --> 25:24.763
What happened?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.724
Crichton:
Who cares? Just go. Go, go!

25:29.070 --> 25:29.820
Go!

25:29.904 --> 25:32.441
Go, go, go!

25:32.532 --> 25:37.071
You did it. Now, open the
hangar doors.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.571
Come on!

25:42.125 --> 25:44.207
Hurry! Move!
Elack's on his way back!

25:46.254 --> 25:47.744
( beeping )

25:48.297 --> 25:49.628
Damn!

25:49.716 --> 25:52.958
It's out of oil! I can't
believe it! It's out of oil!

25:59.976 --> 26:02.433
Why are they all out of oil?!

26:04.439 --> 26:05.804
Come on!

26:08.985 --> 26:12.523
Rygel:
Pilot, if you can, lock onto the
Marauder's coordinates again.

26:12.613 --> 26:20.702
Elack, if we don't find the
strength, it's all been
for nothing.

26:20.788 --> 26:25.282
We must try.
Target the Marauders.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.457
We're in. Let's go.
-Get us out of here.

26:30.548 --> 26:35.417
Elack... now.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.766
(equipment powers down )

26:59.368 --> 27:01.859
(sigh)

27:01.954 --> 27:03.740
Pilot.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.037
Are we clear?

27:05.124 --> 27:06.955
Yeah, but we've been hit
pretty badly.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.250
The deception shroud's
been compromised.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.498
We're gonna reappear in about
a hundred microts.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.375
D'Argo, I do apologize...

27:13.466 --> 27:16.253
Jool, not now!

27:16.344 --> 27:18.630
(device trilling)

27:18.721 --> 27:20.632
The magnetics are
spiking, Braca.

27:20.723 --> 27:25.308
Ma'am, two Marauders were
destroyed but the third is
still operational.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.305
We can make it back to
the Command Carrier.

27:27.396 --> 27:32.686
And give Crichton
two arns head start?

27:32.777 --> 27:37.237
Tell the Carrier to retrieve
us in flight.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.530
We're going after them now.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.069
Grayza:
Lock onto their
coordinates, Braca.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.869
Noranti:
The Darnaz Probes.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.160
They're still here.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.962
Don't forget them, Crichton.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.711
Don't. They are not safe.

27:58.886 --> 28:01.673
(grunting)

28:01.764 --> 28:05.552
Don't be afraid. I know a way.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.853
Whoa, whoa. What are you
talking about?

28:11.941 --> 28:14.273
It's a great plan.
God, I love it.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.817
We leave the planet, then we
come right back.

28:19.407 --> 28:23.901
Ah, I knew it was a lousy plan
from the microt you told me.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.656
Should have left me in the Pod.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.532
Stop complaining!

28:27.623 --> 28:30.160
At least I picked you up.
There was nothing I could do.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.867
They hit the deception shroud
and the turbines were
about to fail.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.248
How come the Marauder
went past us?

28:35.339 --> 28:38.706
I fired a satellite probe.
Hopefully they'll follow that
for about a day.

28:38.801 --> 28:42.134
Oh, great. Then come right
back and kill us.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.337
That's great. We've got
a day to live.

28:44.432 --> 28:48.550
D'Argo:
No. Because by then, I would
have fixed the turbines and we'll be long gone.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.680
That is not gonna
be possible.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.228
Look at your skin.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.974
This due to the magnetics?

28:57.570 --> 28:59.310
Yeah.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.818
We stay here one more am and
we're all gonna be dead.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.740
Crichton:
Can you get this thing
fixed in an em?

29:04.827 --> 29:06.192
Get us out of here?

29:06.287 --> 29:08.528
It'll be difficult because they
hit both power grids.

29:08.623 --> 29:11.365
When we first got here, Vella,
she said something about
the probes.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.199
If we what...
-Get all three probes,

29:13.294 --> 29:17.628
reactivate them at 600 motras
apart, we can reverse
the magnetics.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.922
Did you say motras or metras?
-Motras.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.466
So like, just over half a
metra? -That's it.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.885
Then let's go find the
third probe.

29:27.558 --> 29:30.220
I was wrong.

29:30.311 --> 29:33.303
It was you, not Vella.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.262
You want the probes
as a weapon.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.440
Where did Crichton
see the probe?

29:37.526 --> 29:40.438
I... I don't know.
I don't know exactly.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.320
He told me he saw it.
He said it was buried.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.153
Well, Crichton was there.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.205
And he was there.
And he was here. He was...
he was everywhere.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.954
Stop! You tell me where
it is, now!

29:56.045 --> 29:58.832
I'll... I'll nevertell. Never.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.289
We'll die here. We'll all die.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.170
Granny. Gran...

30:03.260 --> 30:05.046
We're going probe hunting.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.970
Sorry to interrupt the party,
Black Lagoon, but you
have to go now.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.547
Get, get! Go on. Get, get!

30:09.642 --> 30:11.178
No, look, come back.

30:11.268 --> 30:15.056
Now, I know you hurt me, but
I don't wanna hurt you.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.399
I have...

30:18.067 --> 30:20.228
Ineed...

30:20.319 --> 30:21.729
Oh, that doesn't sound too good.

30:21.821 --> 30:25.154
I've looked for the Darnaz
Triangle for 20 cycles.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.232
I will wait no longer!

30:28.077 --> 30:29.237
You tell me where it is.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.159
Or you die!

30:32.832 --> 30:34.117
The probe. Where is it?

30:34.208 --> 30:38.292
Hey, I wanna find it
as much as you do.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.711
It's the only way we're gonna
get out of this situation,

30:40.798 --> 30:44.290
if we reverse what's going on.

30:44.385 --> 30:45.966
We don't need her for that.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.759
Where is it?

30:47.847 --> 30:50.429
Actually, we do need her.

30:50.516 --> 30:57.228
If I can't do it, she's the
only one who can... can help.

30:57.314 --> 31:00.056
You won't get a second chance
without her.

31:00.151 --> 31:02.767
Probe is... it's that way.

31:02.862 --> 31:07.105
You. In front with the
old woman.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.191
Over there.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.447
Behind those rocks.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.867
So you know where the
other probes are.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.243
In the lair.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.165
That bitch Vella had them.

31:19.253 --> 31:21.915
Swore I'd get my share
of the bounty.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.291
But she lied.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.839
She tried to hide the
other two probes.

31:25.926 --> 31:26.915
Bounty?

31:27.011 --> 31:30.094
Now they'll pay me.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.092
There.

31:53.287 --> 31:55.152
The third probe.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.080
It's mine.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.125
Now I have no further
use for you.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.716
No, Jool, don't shoot him.
He's got the probe.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.381
Stop him!

32:30.116 --> 32:32.983
What the hell is he doing?!
He's gonna get us all killed!

32:33.077 --> 32:35.318
Crichton, we're all
gonna die.

32:35.412 --> 32:36.993
Oh!

32:37.081 --> 32:40.118
But he can live down there,
until the magnetic summer ends.

32:40.209 --> 32:41.119
And?

32:41.210 --> 32:43.246
And...

32:50.678 --> 32:52.293
Was that Winona?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.295
Yes.

32:57.518 --> 33:02.603
I really don't wanna know
where you hid her.

33:03.524 --> 33:07.187
(yells)

33:16.412 --> 33:19.199
You help Crichton, I'll get the
other probes from Oo-nii's lair.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.279
Go!

33:53.699 --> 33:54.939
Ah!

34:46.293 --> 34:47.954
Crichton.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.203
Crichton!

34:58.347 --> 34:59.632
Come on.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.277
John! l have both probes.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.327
Yeah, Jool, I got the
third probe.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.576
How far did you say they
had to be apart?

35:26.667 --> 35:29.329
Six hundred motras.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.331
All right.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.253
Did you just save my life?

35:33.340 --> 35:34.716
Again.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.210
Thanks.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.213
Hey, Pip, go with Jools.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.386
See if you can get those
probes reactivated.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.882
Right.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.095
Hey, how do I do that?

35:45.185 --> 35:47.267
Slam 'em on the ground
and kick 'em.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.436
Kick 'em. Right.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.235
Chiana:
Crichton, I've got the
other probe.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.779
Crichton:
Good, Pip, just keep moving.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.876
Oh, this is far enough.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.251
Here goes nothing.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.192
Come on, work, damn you.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.735
ls yours working?

36:38.822 --> 36:40.278
Nothing's happening.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.402
You son of a bitch.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.747
Wait. Wait.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.251
It's... It's working.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.960
You guys seeing this?

37:44.388 --> 37:49.382
Noranti:
What was lost is now gained.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.601
Son ofa gun.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.290
I can breathe again. I can.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.545
The probes.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.218
They must've reversed
the magnetics.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.093
John, it worked.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.345
John.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.637
John.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.316
I'm okay.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.235
Me, too.

38:57.753 --> 39:02.417
Hey, you guys probably want
to come check this out.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.177
What is that?

39:14.019 --> 39:16.385
The lost Temple.

39:21.235 --> 39:23.191
The Darnaz Triangle.

39:23.278 --> 39:29.740
When it created the magnetic
summers, it... it must've
trapped part of the past.

39:29.826 --> 39:33.535
They're the same priests that
were here 12,000 cycles ago.

39:33.622 --> 39:36.364
Rygel:
Do they know time has passed?

39:36.458 --> 39:38.164
Crichton:
I don't think so.

39:38.252 --> 39:40.334
So you're saying they've been...

39:40.420 --> 39:43.036
they've been frozen like balla
and now they're awake?

39:43.131 --> 39:46.373
They don't know anything
that's happened?

39:46.468 --> 39:48.754
I don't think they know
we're here.

39:50.013 --> 39:53.676
So the question is do we
stay or do we go?

39:53.767 --> 39:56.634
I think that decision should
rest with Jool.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.475
She's the instructor here now.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.235
I'm gonna say hello.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.365
Okay.

40:33.307 --> 40:38.677
Well, everything we found
proves our races are linked.

40:40.188 --> 40:44.227
Maybe you should stay.
Study what we discover.

40:44.318 --> 40:45.979
Wish I could.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.355
You know I can't.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.360
That Aeryn ninx, right?

40:52.451 --> 40:54.737
(laughing)

40:54.828 --> 40:57.365
Yeah. You take care.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.913
|Wi||.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.740
You, too.

41:10.344 --> 41:14.508
Is, uh... is he the last?

41:14.598 --> 41:16.213
Yeah.

41:16.308 --> 41:20.517
I've said goodbye to everyone.
I can't make any of you stay.

41:20.604 --> 41:22.890
Well, uh, you're the only
who can stay.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.064
You're the only one not being
hunted by the Peacekeepers.

41:28.612 --> 41:31.274
The Priests will need help.

41:32.616 --> 41:36.825
They have 12,000 cycles
of catching up.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.283
D'Argo.

41:48.590 --> 41:55.052
I am so sorry for not
defending you.

41:55.138 --> 41:58.096
Maybe you weren't Vella's
intellectual equal, but...

41:58.183 --> 42:01.220
But I am now. She's a rock.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.176
I'm trying to apologize.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.477
Go on.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.186
You...

42:10.362 --> 42:20.158
you have more courage,
integrity and honesty than
a dozen Vellas.

42:22.249 --> 42:25.412
And I should've said
that to her.

43:09.379 --> 43:11.665
We retrieved their
satellite probe.

43:11.757 --> 43:14.464
They must have shot it
ahead as a lure.

43:15.761 --> 43:19.094
I will find them again
and when I do,

43:19.181 --> 43:22.469
they will pay for this
humiliation.

43:24.728 --> 43:27.891
But if I hear any gossip,

43:27.981 --> 43:30.472
a joke in the Officers' Club,

43:30.567 --> 43:34.185
anything at all about what
happened at Arnessk...

43:34.279 --> 43:37.316
You won't.
-If I do...

43:37.407 --> 43:40.114
you shall answer for it.

43:43.413 --> 43:44.869
D'Argo:
Oh, come on.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.207
Look on the positive side.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.156
At least Jool won't be
hunted anymore.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.163
Unlike us.

43:51.254 --> 43:56.294
She can stay on Arnessk, have a
goal, something to fight for.

43:56.384 --> 43:59.296
Unlike us.

44:00.472 --> 44:03.179
So any response from Moya?

44:03.266 --> 44:04.176
Not yet.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.803
I've sent out a secure Comm,

44:05.894 --> 44:08.135
but I'm not even sure if this
transmitter's working properly.

44:08.230 --> 44:10.846
Great. We're hunted by
Peacekeepers,

44:10.941 --> 44:14.433
towing a dead module, lost in
the Uncharted Territories

44:14.528 --> 44:16.314
with no purpose in life.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.861
How good does it get?

44:18.949 --> 44:20.234
Oh, no.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.032
One of us has a purpose,
don't you, Crichton?

44:23.119 --> 44:25.371
Crichton:
Hey, Grandma.

44:25.455 --> 44:27.036
Why'd you try to kill me?

44:27.123 --> 44:31.833
If Grayza asked, couldn't
have you giving her the
Darnaz Probes.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.627
Better you dead than millions
if she misused them.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.841
What's your name, old woman?

44:37.551 --> 44:40.293
Utu-Noranti-Pralatong.

44:40.387 --> 44:45.051
Well, Noranti,

44:45.141 --> 44:47.177
you're right.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.510
I do have a purpose.
