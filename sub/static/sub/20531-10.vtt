What I think is cool is that

00:04.750 --> 00:06.170
we're watching all this stuff
that's happening

00:06.170 --> 00:07.630
here on the screen,

00:07.630 --> 00:10.210
but we're looking
at Dr. Chopra right now.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.220
He sits there
perfectly still, motionless,

DARIO NARDI:
Very, very conscious control

00:16.010 --> 00:19.060

and all this inner world

00:19.060 --> 00:21.020
that he can activate, or not.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.890
DEEPAK CHOPRA: In many spiritual
traditions in the East,

00:23.890 --> 00:25.770
they say there are three states
of consciousness

00:25.770 --> 00:27.480
that we all go through
every day:

00:27.480 --> 00:29.860
our sleep, dreams and waking.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.400
But then there's
a state of consciousness

00:32.400 --> 00:34.530
that's called
"cosmic consciousness,"

00:34.530 --> 00:36.700
which is beyond
the physical world,

00:36.700 --> 00:39.660
and basically
a record of the entire

00:39.660 --> 00:41.540
history of the universe.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.410
♪ ♪

01:12.440 --> 01:15.360
NARRATOR: Although completely
invisible to the naked eye,

01:15.360 --> 01:18.490
a virtual universe
of electromagnetic waves

01:18.490 --> 01:22.200
permeates our entire world.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.620
And this vast network
of impulses carries within it

01:25.620 --> 01:28.540
information and data
that we have come to depend on

01:28.540 --> 01:30.500
in our digital age.

01:32.630 --> 01:35.050
It is the backbone of
what is otherwise referred to

01:35.050 --> 01:36.930
as the cloud,

01:36.930 --> 01:40.300
which remotely stores
billions of gigabytes of data.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.220
When we think about the cloud,

01:42.220 --> 01:44.890
what we're really talking about
is data transfer,

01:44.890 --> 01:47.770
information transfer.

01:47.770 --> 01:51.150
You're sending bits of
information through the air,

01:51.150 --> 01:54.900
wirelessly, up to satellites,
down to servers, back again,

01:54.900 --> 01:56.780
into your computer,
into your phone,

01:56.780 --> 01:59.910
and there's close to
seven billion people

01:59.910 --> 02:02.200
using cloud computing now.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.790
So you can imagine that pretty
much anywhere on the planet

02:05.790 --> 02:08.120

you're going to find

02:08.120 --> 02:11.460
these hidden, sort of,
secret patterns and codes

02:11.460 --> 02:13.130
that are floating around us.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.380
NARRATOR:
According to historians,

02:18.380 --> 02:22.180
the concept of an
intergalactic computer network

02:22.180 --> 02:27.680
was first proposed by scientist
J. C. R Licklider in the 1960s.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.190
However, ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

02:32.190 --> 02:35.360
that the idea may actually
trace all the way back

02:35.360 --> 02:37.610
to our ancient past.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.530
Korva Island. Raichur, India.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.290
Religious pilgrims
seeking enlightened wisdom

02:49.290 --> 02:51.380
travel here to
a temple dedicated

02:51.380 --> 02:54.880
to the celestial sage Narada.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.840
According to
the Hindu scriptures,

02:57.840 --> 03:00.300
Narada had
the supernatural ability

03:00.300 --> 03:02.760
to gain access
to a hidden domain

03:02.760 --> 03:05.890
that most humans
are completely unaware of:

03:05.890 --> 03:08.600
the realm of cosmic knowledge.

03:11.140 --> 03:14.480
Tales about Narada appear
in the Mahabharata,

03:14.480 --> 03:17.230
in the Ramayana, in the Puranas.

03:17.230 --> 03:22.110
Tradition has it that Narada
transcended consciousness

03:22.110 --> 03:26.830
to gather his stories and give
teachings of great wisdom.

03:26.830 --> 03:30.330
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA: The Narada
is called Narada Rishi.

03:30.330 --> 03:35.960
Rishis are like sages
in Western concept.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.260
So they have gained this ability

03:39.260 --> 03:42.380
to be able to tap into
the knowledge,

03:42.380 --> 03:45.050
access that knowledge
directly from the cosmos.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.180
Narada is interesting,

03:49.180 --> 03:52.640
specifically that
he clearly had access

03:52.640 --> 03:56.730
to an essential knowledge

03:56.730 --> 04:00.490
that is at the fabric
of the divine cosmic order.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.870
NARRATOR: This idea of
an otherworldly repository

04:08.870 --> 04:12.910
of cosmic information is
most commonly referred to today

04:12.910 --> 04:16.750
as the "Akashic record."

04:16.750 --> 04:21.420
The term was coined in 1883
by author Alfred Percy Sinnett,

04:21.420 --> 04:25.680
in his book <i>Esoteric Buddhism.</i>

04:25.680 --> 04:29.810
In it, he describes how,
according to Eastern philosophy,

04:29.810 --> 04:32.230
universal records
physically exist

04:32.230 --> 04:35.770
in the ever‐pervasive realm
known as the "Akasha,"

04:35.770 --> 04:38.020
which can be accessed
by enlightened individuals.

04:41.650 --> 04:45.820
SHIMKHADA: "Akasha" is
a Sanskrit word; it means sky.

04:45.820 --> 04:50.450
So Akashic records can be
considered as cosmic knowledge.

04:50.450 --> 04:53.660
So it is belonging
to the cosmos.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.710
Everything written in the sky.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.750
It's not belonging
to human beings.

04:58.750 --> 05:03.590
You simply cannot go and bring
it in its tangible form.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.970
It's something that can be
accessed through your mind,

05:06.970 --> 05:08.760
through your brainpower,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.970
through your
spiritual wavelength.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.850
CHOPRA:
The Akashic Field,

05:15.850 --> 05:18.980
it's the immeasurable potential
of all that was, is,

05:18.980 --> 05:21.270
and will ever be.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.400
It's completely non‐local.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.570
"Non‐local" means there is
no experience of space or time.

05:26.570 --> 05:30.870
This is the level
of entanglement,

05:30.870 --> 05:35.580
where everything in the universe
is inseparably correlated

05:35.580 --> 05:37.830
with everything else
in the universe.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.920
I have always called the
universe "the wireless network,"

05:43.920 --> 05:48.050
where information is just
out there and stored

05:48.050 --> 05:51.050
from all our minds and memories,

05:51.050 --> 05:54.430
from every creature
living in this universe.

05:54.430 --> 05:56.770
This bank of knowledge
has been with us

05:56.770 --> 05:58.810
since the formation
of the universe.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.610
SCOTT:
The idea of the Akashic record,

06:04.610 --> 06:07.490
it's where inventions come from,
it's where art comes from,

06:07.490 --> 06:09.990
it's where science comes from.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.530
You can call it
whatever you want.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.450
It's something that's
in the substrate, right?

06:14.450 --> 06:16.450
It's something that you could
access and, sort of,

06:16.450 --> 06:18.460
find information
that's been hidden.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.920
Not even hidden. I mean, it's
available to us all the time.

06:20.920 --> 06:25.010
It's just that certain people
who tune into it can unlock it.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.880
This Akashic record
may be something

06:27.880 --> 06:32.890
that every biological entity in
the universe can gain access to.

06:32.890 --> 06:35.930
I believe it's something that

06:35.930 --> 06:38.980
even extraterrestrials
would tap into.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.520
NARRATOR:
Throughout history,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.780
countless prophets
and visionaries

06:45.780 --> 06:48.530
have alluded to accessing
such a realm.

06:48.530 --> 06:52.660
‐(man chanting) ‐And spiritual
practitioners the world over

06:52.660 --> 06:55.870
claim that, through deep prayer
and meditation,

06:55.870 --> 06:57.700
an individual may be
granted glimpses

06:57.700 --> 06:59.370
into this divine domain.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.790
There seemed to be a common way

07:03.790 --> 07:05.920
to tap into
all of this information

07:05.920 --> 07:08.840
that all these prophets
were following.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.800
The first thing
was to quiet your mind,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.720
and this is the time
where your brain waves

07:15.720 --> 07:20.810
start to tap into
higher‐dimensional realities.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.900
When we say "deep meditation,"

07:22.900 --> 07:26.780
we mean going into
that state of awareness.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.650
That's called
"cosmic consciousness."

07:29.650 --> 07:32.740
What you're accessing is

07:32.740 --> 07:38.160
the non‐local aspects
of consciousness,

07:38.160 --> 07:43.120
which are connected to past,
present, future, in a sense.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.750
NARRATOR: If a cosmic realm
of information truly exists,

07:47.750 --> 07:52.010
could there really be a way
for humans to access it?

07:52.010 --> 07:54.760
Perhaps further clues
can be found

07:54.760 --> 07:57.470
by testing what's happening

Okay, Dr. Chopra,
we're going to get a baseline.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.990
Okay, so we're taking a look
at the brain now

08:59.990 --> 09:02.200
before his meditation.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.750
So each of the sensors
corresponds roughly

mean? ‐So when we see that red

09:16.430 --> 09:19.300

that's much more active,

09:19.300 --> 09:21.680

and the black here,

09:21.680 --> 09:24.140
then the brain
has gotten very quiet.

09:24.140 --> 09:27.020
‐Okay. ‐And each one
of these views here

09:27.020 --> 09:28.980

10:00.010 --> 10:03.310
certainly not by itself,
down in the corner here.

10:03.310 --> 10:06.480
So this is in areas of the brain
in the back, the visual cortex,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.600

that the brain is really

10:08.600 --> 10:10.980
disengaging from everyday life

10:10.980 --> 10:13.780

the zero‐point energy exists

12:22.400 --> 12:25.280
and it carries
a lot of information

12:25.280 --> 12:27.990
about the universe in it.

12:27.990 --> 12:31.700
Laszlo proposed
that this didn't carry

12:31.700 --> 12:34.120
just a physical information

12:34.120 --> 12:36.670
about the physics
of the universe,

12:36.670 --> 12:39.920
but also it contained
intellectual information.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.640
NARRATOR: According
to theoretical physicists,

12:45.640 --> 12:48.970
zero‐point energy
is an all‐pervasive sea

12:48.970 --> 12:52.140
of quantum energy waves
that is invisible,

12:52.140 --> 12:54.850
but exists
throughout the universe.

12:54.850 --> 12:57.360
The fabric of space itself

12:57.360 --> 13:01.280
is made of energy
and information.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.990
And the way this information
propagates through the universe

13:04.990 --> 13:06.740
is through waves.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.570
We call that quantum waves.

13:08.570 --> 13:13.540
And so, the Akashic Field
is made of quantum waves

13:13.540 --> 13:16.670
that are common
to all intelligent life.

13:16.670 --> 13:21.380
This means that all human
brains, extraterrestrial brains,

13:21.380 --> 13:24.420
any sort of otherworldly beings

13:24.420 --> 13:28.590
also are tapping into
similar quantum waves.

13:31.470 --> 13:35.060
DAVID WILCOCK: This idea of an
intelligent informational field

13:35.060 --> 13:37.190
that we can access
with our consciousness

13:37.190 --> 13:39.650
is not pseudoscience.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.650
It's not superstition.

13:41.650 --> 13:44.820
It is a basic fact
that our scientists

13:44.820 --> 13:47.780
are finding out is really true.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.160
NARRATOR: Nearly two decades
prior to Lazlo's discovery,

13:54.160 --> 13:57.670
Nobel Prize‐winning physicist
Richard Feynman

13:57.670 --> 14:00.960
published his groundbreaking
work in quantum physics,

14:00.960 --> 14:05.090
<i>The Strange Theory</i>
<i>of Light and Matter.</i>

14:05.090 --> 14:09.340
In it, he explored the idea
that electrons in our brains

14:09.340 --> 14:12.510
can be activated and informed
by quantum waves,

14:12.510 --> 14:15.430
affecting our thoughts
and subconscious.

14:15.430 --> 14:18.310
SCOTT:
So, Richard Feynman talked about

14:18.310 --> 14:21.190
the quantum
entanglement theory,

14:21.190 --> 14:24.690
and the idea that you could
have subatomic particles

14:24.690 --> 14:27.990
at any distance whatsoever and
they could affect each other,

14:27.990 --> 14:32.530
where information can be sent,
uh, at great speeds,

14:32.530 --> 14:34.580
uh, instantaneously, actually.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.830
BRANDENBURG: The human brain
is full of electrical activity.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.750
That creates radiation

14:41.750 --> 14:44.500
that a very sensitive
radio receiver could pick up.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.510
And other minds, other places

14:47.510 --> 14:49.470
would also be able
to send such waves.

14:49.470 --> 14:54.810
Feynman found from the idea of
a quantum field of information

14:54.810 --> 14:57.270
an electron moving in our brains

14:57.270 --> 15:01.100
could be receiving radio signals
from the past.

15:01.100 --> 15:06.610
But to compensate, it must also
receive waves from the future.

15:06.610 --> 15:09.900
Now, this means

15:09.900 --> 15:12.780
that every electron
in our brains

15:12.780 --> 15:16.160
is actually a receiver.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.580
WILCOCK:
Information could traverse

15:18.580 --> 15:21.580
to any part of the universe
instantaneously.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.340
This could mean that
intelligent civilizations

15:24.340 --> 15:27.920
could send
complex information to us

15:27.920 --> 15:30.840
by quantum wave propagation
or other means.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.850
They could very much
be nudging society along

15:33.850 --> 15:36.760
through people having
apparent visions,

15:36.760 --> 15:40.560
which could be nothing more
complex than a radio broadcast,

15:40.560 --> 15:42.650
some sort of
thought transference

15:42.650 --> 15:44.360
through the Akashic record.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.570
NARRATOR:
Could the Akashic Field

15:49.570 --> 15:53.320
be similar to our modern
invention of the cloud,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.530
but hold an infinitely
larger field of information,

15:56.530 --> 16:01.250
one through which the user
can gain not just insight,

16:01.250 --> 16:06.090
but even foresight
into future events?

16:06.090 --> 16:09.670
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

16:09.670 --> 16:13.510
and suggest further clues
can be found by investigating

16:13.510 --> 16:15.890
the story of a blind,
Bulgarian peasant

16:15.890 --> 16:19.520
and her incredibly
accurate prophecies.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.620
NARRATOR:
Novo Selo, Bulgaria. 1923.

16:30.620 --> 16:34.500
A 12‐year old peasant girl,
Vangelia,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.710
is playing with her cousins
in a field

16:36.710 --> 16:40.300
when she gets caught up
in a freak storm.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.970
She was carried off
into the air by tornado.

16:43.970 --> 16:48.390
And‐and they found
her motionless body

16:48.390 --> 16:50.140
in a field.

16:50.140 --> 16:53.730
And strangely,
her eyes were completely caked

16:53.730 --> 16:59.240
with sand and dust, and she said
that she couldn't open them

16:59.240 --> 17:01.530
without excruciating pain.

17:01.530 --> 17:05.490
And what then began was
a decline in her ability to see.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.460
NARRATOR:
After the accident,

17:10.460 --> 17:14.000
Vangelia developed a striking
ability to predict the future

17:14.000 --> 17:16.670
and began making
accurate revelations

17:16.670 --> 17:18.800
for the local population.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.380
By the 1980s, the blind prophet,

17:22.380 --> 17:24.930
who adopted the name Baba Vanga,

17:24.930 --> 17:28.140
had given thousands
of accurate predictions

17:28.140 --> 17:32.600
and gained a reputation as
the Nostradamus of the Balkans.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.480
Baba Vanga said that
she could see in her mind's eye.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.230
And when she would
look at a person,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.190
she said that she could see
their whole life

17:39.190 --> 17:43.030
in its totality, complete,
from birth, through their life,

17:43.030 --> 17:45.830
until death, as if she were
watching a movie.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.700
HOGUE:
She was the study

17:48.700 --> 17:52.410
of many Bulgarian
and Soviet scientists,

17:52.410 --> 17:57.710
who scientifically started
testing her and interviewing her

17:57.710 --> 17:59.300
and the people that she read.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.800
And they have found that
it is an 80% accuracy.

18:03.800 --> 18:08.260
CORY: Her predictions
were actually very accurate,

18:08.260 --> 18:12.980
which tells us that the ability
to retrieve information

18:12.980 --> 18:14.900
beyond this Earth plane

18:14.900 --> 18:18.730
has nothing to do
with our five senses.

18:18.730 --> 18:24.450
In fact, when she became blind,
it is as if her other senses

18:24.450 --> 18:27.160
developed to receive messages

18:27.160 --> 18:29.370
and information
about the future.

18:29.370 --> 18:31.910
NARRATOR:
Among her numerous claims

18:31.910 --> 18:34.870
were predictions
relating to world events,

18:34.870 --> 18:37.130
many which would
later come true.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.710
New York City.

18:40.710 --> 18:43.970
September 11, 2001.

18:51.020 --> 18:54.230
Two planes hijacked by members
of a terrorist group

18:54.230 --> 18:57.770
called Al‐Qaeda crashed
into the World Trade Center,

18:57.770 --> 19:02.360
taking the lives of nearly
3,000 innocent civilians.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.370
Sumatra, Indonesia.

19:08.370 --> 19:11.410
December 26, 2004.

19:22.050 --> 19:26.300
A 9.1 magnitude earthquake
off the coast of the island

19:26.300 --> 19:29.720
creates a devastating tsunami,

19:29.720 --> 19:34.350
completely engulfing
over 3,000 miles of land

19:34.350 --> 19:38.520
and claiming the lives
of over 230,000 people.

19:40.110 --> 19:42.110
Washington, D. C.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.940
January 20, 2009.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.870
I, Barack Hussein Obama,
do solemnly swear...

19:57.870 --> 20:00.290
NARRATOR:
Barack Obama,

20:00.290 --> 20:02.800
an African‐American senator
from Illinois,

20:02.800 --> 20:07.550
is sworn into office as the 44th
President of the United States.

20:07.550 --> 20:10.260
‐Congratulations, Mr. President.
‐(crowd cheering)

20:13.720 --> 20:16.270
HOGUE: We must remember,
these amazing things

20:16.270 --> 20:18.560
are coming from someone
who was born a peasant,

20:18.560 --> 20:22.610
who has not read books,

20:22.610 --> 20:25.990
had a slight, maybe functional
literacy with braille.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.740
But she essentially has
no access to televisions,

20:29.740 --> 20:31.490
no access to movies.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.370
This is coming
out of her interiority.

20:36.790 --> 20:40.120
NARRATOR: Baba Vanga proclaimed
her prophetic abilities

20:40.120 --> 20:44.380
not only allowed her to tap into
an unknown realm of information,

20:44.380 --> 20:48.050
but it also put her in contact
with extraterrestrials.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.880
HOGUE:
Baba Vanga talked

20:49.880 --> 20:53.010
about these extraterrestrials
that are invisible,

20:53.010 --> 20:56.020
or more like they are presences

20:56.020 --> 20:59.060
like clear reflections
of water shimmering.

20:59.060 --> 21:02.600
And they shared
with her many secrets,

21:02.600 --> 21:04.230
which she says are locked

21:04.230 --> 21:07.860
inside the scriptures
of many religions.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.700
You have to wonder with her

21:10.700 --> 21:12.780
where she was getting
this information.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.410
Is it possible

21:15.410 --> 21:19.330
she was able to access
some kind of knowledge

21:19.330 --> 21:21.960
that's out there

21:21.960 --> 21:25.290
that normal people
cannot access?

21:28.460 --> 21:29.970
NARRATOR:
Throughout the centuries,

21:29.970 --> 21:31.680
there have been
oracles and prophets

21:31.680 --> 21:35.350
that have claimed contact
with otherworldly realms

21:35.350 --> 21:37.640
as a source of
their inspiration.

21:37.640 --> 21:41.890
This includes prolific seers
like Michel de Nostredame,

21:41.890 --> 21:44.310
better known as Nostradamus,

21:44.310 --> 21:47.650
who published his seminal book,
<i>The Prophesies,</i>

21:47.650 --> 21:50.860
in 1555 A. D.

21:50.860 --> 21:54.370
Biographers claim
that he predicted

21:54.370 --> 21:56.030
numerous future events,

21:56.030 --> 21:59.790
including the
Great London Fire of 1666,

21:59.790 --> 22:02.710
the rise of Adolf Hitler,

22:02.710 --> 22:06.790
‐and even the Iranian revolution
of 1979. ‐(crowd chanting)

22:06.790 --> 22:10.010
HOGUE:
Nostradamus has been often shown

22:10.010 --> 22:12.880
as a man looking at
bowls of water.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.220
He did do that,
but that was very minor.

22:15.220 --> 22:20.060
His main use was tapping
into the divine source.

22:20.060 --> 22:23.940
Nostradamus tries,
in his labored narratives,

22:23.940 --> 22:29.110
to explain a divine state
where everything is happening,

22:29.110 --> 22:32.440
not in a linear sense
but all happening at once‐‐

22:32.440 --> 22:36.660
past, present and future
concepts bind into one thing.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.950
CORY:
Most prophets say

22:39.950 --> 22:43.580
that they are tapping
into another reality

22:43.580 --> 22:47.040
beyond this earthly existence.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.670
So, potentially,
they could be tapping

22:49.670 --> 22:53.590
into a layer of reality

22:53.590 --> 22:57.140
that is shared
by otherworldly beings,

22:57.140 --> 23:00.470
extraterrestrial intelligence,
and so on and so forth.

23:00.470 --> 23:03.270
It may be
the information <i>is</i> there,

23:03.270 --> 23:06.060
it's that our brains
are not evolved yet

23:06.060 --> 23:07.900
to see the information.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.690
So there have been mystics
and there have been prophets

23:10.690 --> 23:12.940
and there have been
philosophers who are able,

23:12.940 --> 23:15.320
through either meditation
or observation

23:15.320 --> 23:17.490
or whatever their medium is,

23:17.490 --> 23:19.870
to get to that place
of information,

23:19.870 --> 23:23.830
and have been able to access
something deeper,

23:23.830 --> 23:25.620
something greater,
a bigger picture.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.420
NARRATOR:
If seers like Baba Vanga,

23:30.420 --> 23:32.960
Nostradamus and others

23:32.960 --> 23:36.510
are able to access
an unseen cloud of information

23:36.510 --> 23:38.590
to obtain their prophesies,

23:38.590 --> 23:41.430
might this realm
have also been tapped

23:41.430 --> 23:45.230
by some of history's
most brilliant minds?

23:45.230 --> 23:48.020
Perhaps further clues
can be found

23:48.020 --> 23:51.480
by examining
the shocking statements

23:51.480 --> 23:55.280
made by one of the greatest
visionaries of the 20th century,

23:55.280 --> 23:57.530
Nikola Tesla.

24:05.200 --> 24:10.040
NARRATOR:
New York City. 1922.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.590
Two Columbia University
sociologists,

24:12.590 --> 24:15.920
William Ogburn
and Dorothy Thomas,

24:15.920 --> 24:19.300
publish a paper in the <i>Academy</i>
<i>of Political Science Journal</i>

24:19.300 --> 24:23.010
entitled
"Are Inventions Inevitable?"

24:23.010 --> 24:28.350
In it, they cite 148 instances
of simultaneous inventions

24:28.350 --> 24:30.650
where two or more individuals,

24:30.650 --> 24:33.690
each operating without knowledge
of the others' work,

24:33.690 --> 24:37.030
came up with the same
groundbreaking innovation

24:37.030 --> 24:39.910
or theory at the same time.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.990
BRANDENBURG:
How is it that people

24:42.990 --> 24:46.370
in different continents,
different cultures

24:46.370 --> 24:50.670
can come up with the same idea
at almost exactly the same time?

24:50.670 --> 24:54.250
And it's seen
throughout history.

24:54.250 --> 24:57.670
Albert Einstein says
that he came up with the idea

24:57.670 --> 25:01.680
for relativity in a few moments.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.470
It suddenly came into his mind.

25:04.470 --> 25:07.890
Einstein's discovery
of relativity

25:07.890 --> 25:11.980
was preceded,
almost simultaneously,

25:11.980 --> 25:18.030
by a theoretical physicist,
a Frenchman named Poincaré.

25:18.030 --> 25:20.150
CHILDRESS:
You have the radio

25:20.150 --> 25:23.160
being developed
by both Nikola Tesla

25:23.160 --> 25:26.700
and Guglielmo Marconi
at the same time.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.080
You have the telephone,
also being developed

25:29.080 --> 25:30.750
at the same time.

25:30.750 --> 25:34.460
There's many incidences
in history like this.

25:39.590 --> 25:41.720
NARRATOR:
During World War II,

25:41.720 --> 25:44.260
British engineer
Sir Frank Whittle

25:44.260 --> 25:47.390
and a German physicist,
Hans von Ohain,

25:47.390 --> 25:50.980
both invented
the first jet engine.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.650
The designs
were strikingly similar,

25:53.650 --> 25:57.400
and because they were serving
on different sides of the war,

25:57.400 --> 26:01.320
neither had any knowledge
of the other's work.

26:01.320 --> 26:06.870
TSOUKALOS: More recently, a
revolutionary discovery was made

26:06.870 --> 26:10.580
by two scientists
independent of each other.

26:10.580 --> 26:14.170
In fact, they were
thousands of miles apart.

26:14.170 --> 26:17.130
And they came up
with the same discovery

26:17.130 --> 26:20.630
that neutrinos have mass.

26:20.630 --> 26:25.430
And one has to wonder if this
can be attributed to coincidence

26:25.430 --> 26:28.640
or if both scientists
tapped into

26:28.640 --> 26:31.640
what is known
as the Akashic record.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.060
SCOTT: There have been
discoveries that have shown up

26:34.060 --> 26:36.190
around the planet
at the exact same time.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.730
People that aren't connected,

26:37.730 --> 26:39.610
people that have no influence
upon each other,

26:39.610 --> 26:41.900
and those are the things
that start to emerge

26:41.900 --> 26:43.320
simultaneously
around the planet.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.070
Here's the interesting thing.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.950
This goes back to the idea
that we find information

26:47.950 --> 26:51.790
in the substrate
of the physical world.

26:51.790 --> 26:54.210
It may just be
that every single discovery

26:54.210 --> 26:55.920
that we ever wanted to discover

26:55.920 --> 26:58.250
is already in the room
right now.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.130
It isn't that the information
is not there,

27:01.130 --> 27:04.420
it's that our brains
are not evolved yet

27:04.420 --> 27:06.300
to see the information.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.720
Now, not everybody
is on the same wavelength.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.230
Not everybody's evolved at
the same rate; that's also true.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.770
So there are people
throughout history

27:16.770 --> 27:19.480
that could access
that information.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.530
WILCOCK: This effect has been
documented all the way back

27:23.530 --> 27:25.570
to the time of the Renaissance
and the Reformation‐‐

27:25.570 --> 27:27.450
things like the discovery
of the telescope,

27:27.450 --> 27:30.830
the identification of the colors
in the rainbow,

27:30.830 --> 27:33.580
the identification
of basic chemistry,

27:33.580 --> 27:35.790
the theory of evolution.

27:35.790 --> 27:39.040
Scientists try to explain it.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.550
And they think people have
a certain level of technology

27:41.550 --> 27:44.340
at a certain time, and they have
the tools in front of them

27:44.340 --> 27:46.430
to be able
to make breakthroughs.

27:46.430 --> 27:50.100
That doesn't explain
why it happens so precisely,

27:50.100 --> 27:53.310
that in many cases
it is literally simultaneous.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.890
We have to look
at the possibility

27:55.890 --> 27:59.900
that extraterrestrials
could be introducing ideas

27:59.900 --> 28:02.980
into this information field.

28:02.980 --> 28:07.200
It's sort of as if something has
been uploaded into the cloud.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.530
NARRATOR:
Curious statements

28:12.530 --> 28:14.910
made by one of history's
greatest visionaries,

28:14.910 --> 28:19.710
Nikola Tesla, seem to point
to some sort of influence

28:19.710 --> 28:23.500
from an otherworldly realm
of information.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.840
Tesla was most notably
responsible

28:26.840 --> 28:30.260
for the practical application
of alternating current,

28:30.260 --> 28:33.640
the foundation of
our modern electrical grid.

28:39.690 --> 28:41.650
SEIFER:
In his autobiography,

28:41.650 --> 28:45.230
Tesla, he talked about the day
that he had the revelation

28:45.230 --> 28:48.110
of how to harness
alternating current.

28:48.110 --> 28:52.030
Right before that,
he had a serious flu,

28:52.030 --> 28:55.410
but he said that he felt
that he could detect light

28:55.410 --> 28:59.210
from his forehead and that he
was able to receive information

28:59.210 --> 29:01.250
from other sources,

29:01.250 --> 29:03.840
and that this other source
entered his consciousness

29:03.840 --> 29:07.300
and he was then enabled
to come up with this invention

29:07.300 --> 29:10.930
which changed the world.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.720
Tesla felt
that we were receivers,

29:12.720 --> 29:16.220
that all impulses came
from the outside

29:16.220 --> 29:18.480
and that we worked
under these impulses.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.270
So, he doesn't believe

29:20.270 --> 29:22.810
that they come from dreams
or inner visions.

29:22.810 --> 29:27.150
He really felt that we were, in
a sense, self‐propelled robots.

29:28.990 --> 29:31.860
WILCOCK: It appears
that Tesla got more information

29:31.860 --> 29:34.620
than anyone rightfully
should have been able to get

29:34.620 --> 29:39.080
for his time in history,
where he was and when he was.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.830
It could be the result
of outside influence

29:41.830 --> 29:43.750
from the Akashic Field

29:43.750 --> 29:46.750
steering us along a path
to make sure

29:46.750 --> 29:48.510
that we have reached
a certain level

29:48.510 --> 29:50.420
of technological sophistication

29:50.420 --> 29:53.090
within a certain
prescribed time window.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.350
NARRATOR:
Could the nature of genius

30:02.350 --> 30:04.480
lie in the ability
of visionaries

30:04.480 --> 30:07.570
to tap into an otherworldly
realm of knowledge?

30:09.860 --> 30:13.150
If the information
contained within this field

30:13.150 --> 30:16.490
was uploaded
by extraterrestrials,

30:16.490 --> 30:20.620
as ancient astronaut theorists
propose,

30:20.620 --> 30:26.460
does this suggest that humans
are on a predetermined path?

30:26.460 --> 30:30.590
And if so,
what are we being guided to do?

30:41.520 --> 30:45.440
NARRATOR:
Sofia, Bulgaria.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.860
After her death in 1996,

30:48.860 --> 30:51.780
the home of the 20th century
prophet Baba Vanga

30:51.780 --> 30:53.900
is turned into a museum

30:53.900 --> 30:57.910
so that followers can continue
to pay their respects.

30:57.910 --> 30:59.910
(crowd singing)

30:59.910 --> 31:02.580
Among the hundreds of thousands
of future readings

31:02.580 --> 31:05.670
given by the blind prophet
during her lifetime,

31:05.670 --> 31:09.920
many relate to events concerning
the whole of the human race,

31:09.920 --> 31:14.630
events, centuries, and even
millennia into the future.

31:16.930 --> 31:19.970
If we look
at Baba Vanga's prophecies,

31:19.970 --> 31:22.430
they're a lot like
contemporary science fiction.

31:22.430 --> 31:24.980
In her accounts,

31:24.980 --> 31:28.860
Baba Vanga claimed the world
will undergo many changes.

31:28.860 --> 31:31.570
It will rise, and it will fall.

31:31.570 --> 31:33.650
But the balance
will be established

31:33.650 --> 31:37.360
when extraterrestrials start
to communicate with humans.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.780
She said, "You don't see it now,

31:39.780 --> 31:43.080
"but there is a huge movement
of crafts in the sky.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.410
"Usually, there are
three of them flying.

31:45.410 --> 31:48.540
"They tell me,
'Be prepared for a big event,'

31:48.540 --> 31:51.090
but they don't tell me
what it is."

31:51.090 --> 31:53.670
HOGUE:
Baba Vanga is unique

31:53.670 --> 31:56.510
in being very much a prophet

31:56.510 --> 31:59.510
that looks at the future
of man in space,

31:59.510 --> 32:03.640
humanity in space
and extraterrestrial contact,

32:03.640 --> 32:07.600
which she assures us will happen
in the next 200 years.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.150
HENRY:
By 2130, Baba Vanga prophesied

32:13.150 --> 32:15.900
that human colonies
deep under the ocean

32:15.900 --> 32:17.360
would be created
with the assistance

32:17.360 --> 32:19.410
of extraterrestrial beings,

32:19.410 --> 32:20.950
who would lend us
a tremendous hand

32:20.950 --> 32:23.080
in developing
this new civilization.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.950
By 2183,

32:25.950 --> 32:29.540
humans would already
have a colony on Mars.

32:29.540 --> 32:32.670
The human colony would revolt,

32:32.670 --> 32:35.960
ultimately leading
to a nuclear confrontation.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.930
By 2221,

32:38.930 --> 32:42.890
humanity in search of alien life

32:42.890 --> 32:44.430
would come into contact
or knowledge

32:44.430 --> 32:46.980
of something
absolutely horrific,

32:46.980 --> 32:49.730
but she does not tell us
what this means.

32:52.610 --> 32:54.570
NARRATOR:
Are we headed toward the future

32:54.570 --> 32:58.280
that Baba Vanga
somehow tapped into,

32:58.280 --> 33:01.870
a future that is written
within the Akashic record?

33:05.870 --> 33:09.410
March, 2017.

33:09.410 --> 33:13.330
The U. S. Congress passes
the NASA Authorization Act

33:13.330 --> 33:16.300
and issues a mandate
for the organization

33:16.300 --> 33:20.220
to get humans to Mars by 2033.

33:20.220 --> 33:23.550
Officials at the space agency

33:23.550 --> 33:26.390
immediately respond
with a detailed plan

33:26.390 --> 33:28.520
outlining their strategy
to accomplish this goal.

33:31.190 --> 33:34.060
Along with NASA mission plans,

33:34.060 --> 33:38.360
the European Space Agency,
China, United Arab Emirates

33:38.360 --> 33:41.950
and India are all slated
to send orbiters to the planet

33:41.950 --> 33:44.660
in the next few years.

33:44.660 --> 33:46.790
And private ventures,

33:46.790 --> 33:50.540
including Mars One,
SpaceX and even Boeing

33:50.540 --> 33:52.870
have all set their sights

33:52.870 --> 33:55.460
on successfully colonizing
the Red Planet

33:55.460 --> 33:58.000
within the next decade.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.010
HENRY:
At present,

34:00.010 --> 34:03.260
there's a race among several
nations and private companies

34:03.260 --> 34:06.180
to get to Mars
and to colonize Mars.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.680
So what's going on here?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.350
One of humanity's
great visionaries,

34:10.350 --> 34:13.900
Elon Musk, sees real problems
ahead for humanity.

34:13.900 --> 34:17.400
In his view,
our colonization of Mars

34:17.400 --> 34:20.440
is an effort to save
or back up humanity.

34:22.700 --> 34:26.370
WILCOCK: It's a compelling
possibility that, in fact,

34:26.370 --> 34:30.660
there is some greater
organized effort being made

34:30.660 --> 34:34.330
to steer human knowledge
towards a desired outcome.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.420
Our brain could act
as a tuning fork or antenna

34:40.420 --> 34:42.760
for the Akashic record itself,

34:42.760 --> 34:46.890
which may have very explicit
directions leading us

34:46.890 --> 34:49.850
down a certain path.

34:49.850 --> 34:52.770
CHILDRESS:
We're going to Mars.

34:52.770 --> 34:56.810
We're going to be a space‐faring
nation and civilization,

34:56.810 --> 34:58.570
going to other planets.

34:58.570 --> 35:02.400
And like the phenomenon
of spontaneous invention,

35:02.400 --> 35:04.570
we have people
all over the world

35:04.570 --> 35:08.370
suddenly pushing us
to go to Mars.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.620
Is it possible
that this information

35:12.620 --> 35:17.330
is actually being sent to humans
in order to‐to move us forward?

35:21.340 --> 35:23.720
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

35:23.720 --> 35:25.840
that if mankind
fulfills its mission

35:25.840 --> 35:29.970
to colonize Mars,
we may be repeating the past.

35:33.060 --> 35:37.520
According to scientific evidence
proposed by Dr. John Brandenburg

35:37.520 --> 35:43.190
in an article for the
<i>Journal of Cosmology</i> in 2014,

35:43.190 --> 35:46.780
Baba Vanga's prediction
for a nuclear event on Mars

35:46.780 --> 35:48.700
may have happened once before.

35:51.030 --> 35:52.490
There appears to have been

35:52.490 --> 35:55.960
a devastating
nuclear attack on Mars.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.460
Two massive nuclear weapons

35:58.460 --> 36:00.290
detonated over
the surface of Mars,

36:00.290 --> 36:02.050
apparently dropped from space.

36:08.590 --> 36:11.680
I originally proposed
as an explanation

36:11.680 --> 36:13.890
that this was
a natural nuclear reactor

36:13.890 --> 36:15.890
that had gone unstable.

36:15.890 --> 36:18.560
However, as I talked
to more scientists,

36:18.560 --> 36:22.230
they said
the Xenon spectrum is wrong.

36:22.230 --> 36:24.360
That is weapons signature.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.570
There's no natural phenomenon

36:26.570 --> 36:30.490
that can account
for this nuclear data.

36:30.490 --> 36:32.240
HENRY:
Evidence has shown us

36:32.240 --> 36:35.580
that there's possibility
that Mars did, in fact,

36:35.580 --> 36:38.620
suffer a nuclear war
deep, deep in ancient history.

36:38.620 --> 36:41.670
This would suggest
that human events are repeated

36:41.670 --> 36:43.170
and that throughout time

36:43.170 --> 36:44.960
we go back
and retrace our steps.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.470
SCOTT: It could be that
the past, present and future

36:49.470 --> 36:51.180
has already happened.

36:51.180 --> 36:54.180
And if that's the case, you're
really looking at a system

36:54.180 --> 36:56.640
that repeats itself
over and over and over again.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.020
And that could be looked at
as a script.

37:00.020 --> 37:02.440
It could be looked at
as a computer code.

37:02.440 --> 37:06.190
Then it would make sense
that we are in‐in some way

37:06.190 --> 37:08.700
being directed
by that information.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.120
It is guiding our behavior.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.990
These prophecies
may be actually something

37:14.990 --> 37:17.660
where people
were tapping into a future

37:17.660 --> 37:20.580
that already existed
in some other sense.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.500
And it appears to be something

37:22.500 --> 37:25.460
that is part
of a greater cosmic script

37:25.460 --> 37:27.210
that we're all following

37:27.210 --> 37:29.340
that does have
an extraterrestrial influence

37:29.340 --> 37:32.510
in making sure
that we stay on the script.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.390
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

37:37.390 --> 37:40.600
that the Akashic record
contains a script‐‐

37:40.600 --> 37:43.060
like a cosmic computer code‐‐

37:43.060 --> 37:46.360
that humans are being
programmed to follow?

37:46.360 --> 37:49.320
Perhaps the answer can be found

37:49.320 --> 37:53.030
by examining evidence discovered
by theoretical physicists

37:53.030 --> 37:55.070
that there is
programming language

37:55.070 --> 37:58.450
embedded in the very fabric
of the universe.

38:08.250 --> 38:12.510
NARRATOR:
College Park, Maryland. 2008.

38:12.510 --> 38:16.260
Renowned physicist and
University of Maryland professor

38:16.260 --> 38:19.520
S. James Gates Jr.
coauthors a report

38:19.520 --> 38:22.850
announcing that he found
specific computer code

38:22.850 --> 38:28.020
in the equations defining
the fabric of the universe.

38:28.020 --> 38:31.690
He theorizes that since
these error‐correcting codes

38:31.690 --> 38:33.490
are indistinguishable

38:33.490 --> 38:37.030
from those that drive
search engines on our computers,

38:37.030 --> 38:41.250
it suggests that the cosmos
is digital in nature.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.040
SCOTT: Professor Gates
finding computer code

38:47.040 --> 38:49.960
in his string theories,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.510
it literally shook me,

38:52.510 --> 38:57.600
because what he's saying
is that there is code‐‐

38:57.600 --> 39:00.060
and not only code,

39:00.060 --> 39:03.060
but code that we use
for our computers‐‐

39:03.060 --> 39:06.600
in the fabric of reality.

39:06.600 --> 39:10.730
So the implication is
that our reality is digital,

39:10.730 --> 39:13.190
that every experience
you've ever had

39:13.190 --> 39:15.530
is based on code.

39:15.530 --> 39:18.570
TSOUKALOS: They have found
computer algorithms

39:18.570 --> 39:20.120
in the existence
of the universe,

39:20.120 --> 39:23.370
a code of one and zeros,
which would imply

39:23.370 --> 39:26.580
that the idea
of an information field

39:26.580 --> 39:31.130
or the cloud
is not a new idea,

39:31.130 --> 39:34.800
and it's happened before.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.850
Now, what the forces are
behind the Akashic record,

39:38.850 --> 39:41.310
your guess is as good as mine.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.770
NARRATOR:
If computer code is embedded

39:47.770 --> 39:50.610
within the very fabric
of the universe,

39:50.610 --> 39:52.280
might it have been put there

39:52.280 --> 39:55.990
by an ancient
extraterrestrial race,

39:55.990 --> 39:59.620
or possibly even
an earlier race of humans?

40:01.870 --> 40:05.250
And has mankind established
a new Akashic record

40:05.250 --> 40:08.540
with the creation of the cloud?

40:08.540 --> 40:11.920
But if so,
are we merely following

40:11.920 --> 40:14.840
a pre‐programmed cosmic script

40:14.840 --> 40:17.300
embedded within
an invisible realm

40:17.300 --> 40:21.720
that exists all around us?

40:21.720 --> 40:25.600
Do we have free will,
or are we totally determined?

40:25.600 --> 40:29.230
The answer is:
if you're not aware

40:29.230 --> 40:33.770
of the choices you're making,
you're a biological robot.

40:33.770 --> 40:39.240
But if you become conscious
of the nature of the universe,

40:39.240 --> 40:41.870
then you can start to have
some degree of freedom.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.790
HENRY: As we reclaim
the Akashic records,

40:46.790 --> 40:49.120
and even go beyond it,

40:49.120 --> 40:51.170
this could be the key
that opens the door

40:51.170 --> 40:52.840
that will enable us to enter

40:52.840 --> 40:55.670
into a new level of existence
or a new reality.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.140
SCOTT:
We are evolving to a stage

41:01.140 --> 41:05.560
where we're unlocking
secrets and codes and patterns

41:05.560 --> 41:08.810
that have always been there.

41:08.810 --> 41:12.020
It's mind‐blowing, but it's
also conscious‐altering.

41:12.020 --> 41:16.190
What it does is it starts
to drive humanity towards

41:16.190 --> 41:20.150
discovering what we really are,
who we really are.

41:20.150 --> 41:23.280
What's our purpose here
as a species?

41:26.660 --> 41:29.620
NARRATOR: Is there really
a cosmic repository

41:29.620 --> 41:31.960
of all knowledge
contained within the universe,

41:31.960 --> 41:35.630
past, present and future?

41:35.630 --> 41:38.380
And if so,
does the recent invention

41:38.380 --> 41:41.260
of what is commonly known
as the cloud

41:41.260 --> 41:45.510
help pave the way to a future
of limitless possibilities?

41:45.510 --> 41:49.680
Perhaps when we finally
tap into the Akashic record,

41:49.680 --> 41:51.560
we will find out

41:51.560 --> 41:54.560
that humanity has been following
a program

41:54.560 --> 41:57.900
that has been in place
for millions of years,

41:57.900 --> 42:00.490
a program that will
ultimately lead us

42:00.490 --> 42:04.910
to our final destiny
on other worlds.
