00:02.543 --> 00:04.062
Hi. Hello.

00:04.187 --> 00:06.230
I'm Blake Chesterfield Henderson,

00:06.355 --> 00:08.499
and this is my Thanksgiving video.

00:08.624 --> 00:11.702
Holidays are always
a little tough for me.

00:11.827 --> 00:15.840
Like many children in America
I'm from a broken home.

00:15.965 --> 00:18.476
But I think this turkey day's

00:18.601 --> 00:27.218
gonna be a little
different because...

00:27.343 --> 00:28.987
I'm going to Hedonism II, y'all!

00:29.153 --> 00:30.922
Yeah! Jamaica's premiere sex resort.

00:31.047 --> 00:33.491
Four days, three nights.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.493
And we are just gonna...

00:35.618 --> 00:37.161
Oh! Oh oh oh!

00:37.286 --> 00:38.663
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

00:38.788 --> 00:40.731
Tag 'em and bag 'em!
Ha ha ha!

00:40.856 --> 00:42.733
I'm so excited.

00:42.858 --> 00:45.036
And I'm going with with
my real family, Adam and Ders.

00:45.161 --> 00:46.104
We're gonna have a blast.

00:46.229 --> 00:47.905
There's beaches, there's babes.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.409
And there is also...
Bum bum buh bummm...

00:51.534 --> 00:54.554
A little restaurant called Pastafari.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.215
Italian food with a Jamaican fusion.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.476
Jah, please. Ha ha ha!

00:59.642 --> 01:03.146
Let's go check on the guys...
I'm so excited!

01:03.312 --> 01:04.388
Oh! There he is.

01:04.513 --> 01:06.991
Anders. Say what's up to the camera.

01:07.116 --> 01:08.626
Uh, Ders? Who's Ders?

01:08.751 --> 01:10.094
My name's Buddy Ferrera.

01:10.219 --> 01:11.279
Whoa ho ho ho ho!

01:11.445 --> 01:12.763
You decided to shave
the playoff beard off.

01:12.888 --> 01:14.132
Well, here's the deal.

01:14.257 --> 01:16.167
You see, Anders Holmvik,
he can't go to Hedonism II.

01:16.292 --> 01:18.537
You know, he's gonna run
for city councilman someday.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.039
But Buddy Ferrera, well,
he's a goatee-sportin',

01:22.164 --> 01:23.908
♪ good-time havin' freaky cat ♪

01:24.033 --> 01:24.909
Ahh.

01:25.034 --> 01:25.910
Ha ha ha ha!

01:26.035 --> 01:28.422
Oh, hey, what's up, Adam?

01:28.588 --> 01:30.381
You are lookin'
straight jacked, dude.

01:30.506 --> 01:31.616
- Dang, homie!
- Nice!

01:31.741 --> 01:32.984
I can't go to Hedonism.

01:33.109 --> 01:34.619
I'm not gonna have a good time.
I won't get laid.

01:34.744 --> 01:36.097
- Why?
- Why is that?

01:36.222 --> 01:39.140
Because my dick fell all over!

01:43.486 --> 01:44.762
Oh! Just kidding.
I tucked it back.

01:44.887 --> 01:45.763
It actually hurts a lot.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.691
My dick's back here, though.

Hey, you guys are
packin' sunscreen, right?

02:07.627 --> 02:08.919
Remember, this is their summer.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.020
No way, dude.

02:10.145 --> 02:12.299
I'm trying to get Beyonce dark!

02:12.465 --> 02:14.342
Sun is straight danger!

02:14.508 --> 02:16.561
Don't worry, dude.
I got the self Tanner.

02:16.686 --> 02:18.847
It's good too.
Linda Hogan endorses it.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.932
Hey, has anybody seen my Tevas?

02:21.098 --> 02:22.934
I really need my Tevas.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.895
Hey, fellas, please remember.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.103
I got us dinner reservations.

02:26.228 --> 02:28.506
Thanksgiving dinner at Pastafari,

02:28.631 --> 02:30.484
so pack a fancy outfit.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.543
I've got a blazer, no shirt.

02:32.668 --> 02:33.653
That's what I'm thinking.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.313
Bud, Ders, you're kinda <i>GQ.</i>

02:35.438 --> 02:38.416
Should the tie match my nipples?

02:38.541 --> 02:39.409
Ha ha!

02:39.575 --> 02:41.286
Guys, I found my Tevas.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.620
Just so you know,

02:42.745 --> 02:44.491
I'm really excited to end
my 11-month dry spell,

02:44.616 --> 02:48.418
but we're definitely gonna be seen
each other butt naked humping and stuff.

02:48.584 --> 02:51.087
- I just hope we're ready for that.
- Oh, yeah. Buddy's a go.

02:51.253 --> 02:53.520
Blakester is ready
to get his knob gobbled.

02:53.645 --> 02:54.508
All right!

02:54.674 --> 02:57.702
Let's get weird!
Let's get weird!

02:57.827 --> 02:59.846
Okay, everyone has
their plane ticket, right?

03:00.012 --> 03:02.265
Yeah, I thought we were
chanting "let's get weird."

03:02.431 --> 03:03.975
Good to go!

03:04.141 --> 03:05.060
Okay, bathing suits?

03:05.226 --> 03:06.267
Check!

03:06.602 --> 03:08.346
I will not be wearing a bathing suit.

03:08.471 --> 03:09.815
So, no.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
And, uh, passports.

03:11.273 --> 03:13.584
Oh, yeah!

03:13.709 --> 03:14.945
Huh?

03:15.111 --> 03:17.955
I printed out the forms,
I even filled them out for you!

03:18.080 --> 03:20.758
All you had to do
was sign it and mail it.

03:20.883 --> 03:22.452
You want to tell me
what the hell happened?

03:22.618 --> 03:24.228
You want to know what happened, Ders?

03:24.353 --> 03:27.165
I forgot all of that stuff, Ders!

03:27.331 --> 03:30.668
And I thought that Jamaica
was part of the U.S.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.045
I didn't think I needed a passport!

03:32.211 --> 03:35.006
That's the Bahamas, you buffoon.

03:35.172 --> 03:36.173
Otay, now I know.

03:36.298 --> 03:38.176
You're gonna need a passport, okay?

03:38.342 --> 03:40.178
We're not gonna go.
Just the two of us?

03:40.344 --> 03:42.389
Yeah, two guys going to Hedonism?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.915
That's not the kind of weird
I'm talking about, okay?

03:45.040 --> 03:49.688
I'm going for a very, very
specific type of weird here.

03:51.063 --> 03:52.232
Niche weird!

03:52.481 --> 03:54.525
Plus you're the only one that
knows how to speak Jamaican.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.028
Guys, our flight leaves in six hours.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.730
There's no way we can
get a passport by then.

03:59.855 --> 04:02.166
We can't, but I know one man...

04:02.291 --> 04:05.202
One life wizard... who can.

04:05.327 --> 04:06.246
Man.

04:07.363 --> 04:09.040
Hey, what's up, brah-gers?

04:09.206 --> 04:11.876
Ooh, what are you doin'
to the rape van, bud?

04:12.001 --> 04:12.919
Oh, check it out.

04:13.085 --> 04:14.504
When they throw
the grapes out, right,

04:14.670 --> 04:17.048
I grab 'em, throw 'em
in these crates,

04:17.173 --> 04:18.516
take 'em to the farmers market,

04:18.641 --> 04:19.517
and resell 'em.

04:19.642 --> 04:21.952
So I got me a grape van now.

04:22.077 --> 04:23.346
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

04:23.512 --> 04:24.764
So they're... they're not organic.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.350
- No. I wrote that.
- Genius move.

04:27.516 --> 04:28.659
I'm just glad to see

04:28.784 --> 04:30.020
you're not a drug dealer
anymore, to be honest.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.980
Well, when you really
think about it, Anders,

04:32.146 --> 04:34.900
are we not all drug dealers...
Brah?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.267
- No.
- Yeah, wow.

04:36.392 --> 04:38.737
Just so we're clear,
I do still deal drugs.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.238
- Oh. Thank God.
- Whew!

04:40.404 --> 04:41.656
- Whoo!
- Best in the business.

04:41.822 --> 04:42.940
You know, I'd love to chitchat,

04:43.065 --> 04:44.709
but we've got six hours
to get to Hedonism II.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.162
And I don't have a passport,
so I need your help, bud.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.880
Oh, I'm sorry, but I've been
out of the passport game

04:50.005 --> 04:51.374
since college.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.710
Uh, red flag.
You didn't go to college.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.454
Well, I parked my van
outside of a college

04:56.579 --> 04:57.881
for three and a half semesters.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.391
Okay, no, but you have to have
some, like, scumbag friends

05:00.516 --> 05:01.659
who can hook me up.

05:01.784 --> 05:03.929
Come on, I am desperate
house dude at this moment, dude.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.723
Ah... Dale and Betsy.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.225
Yeah, they make fake I.D.S.

05:09.391 --> 05:10.968
they could totally make you
a fake passport.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.271
They made me a birth certificate
when I lost mine.

05:13.437 --> 05:14.672
- Perfect! Nice!
- I'm sorry.

05:14.797 --> 05:15.673
Hold the phone!

05:15.798 --> 05:16.674
Fake passports?

05:16.799 --> 05:18.068
We never talked about this.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.477
Okay, I'll get you guys the address.

05:19.602 --> 05:20.478
I'm going on this trip.

05:20.603 --> 05:21.612
I'm going to Pastafari,

05:21.737 --> 05:24.908
and I will try
the Jamaican jerk lasagna.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.284
Fake passports equals felony, okay?

05:27.409 --> 05:28.853
If you guys want to get
involved in this,

05:28.978 --> 05:30.755
you're gonna have to sign
some sort of affidavit

05:30.880 --> 05:32.248
saying I had nothing to do with it.

05:32.414 --> 05:34.158
Yeah. I don't know what
an affidavit is, though,

05:34.283 --> 05:35.159
so how can I sign that?

05:35.284 --> 05:36.294
Is that like a fruit?

05:36.460 --> 05:38.796
It's basically, like,
what lawyers use

05:38.921 --> 05:40.264
when they need to win a case.

05:40.389 --> 05:41.466
To make a bill a law.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.167
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

05:43.292 --> 05:45.169
Yeah, that makes sense.
<i>Law and Order: SVU.</i>

05:45.294 --> 05:46.170
We'll sign it.

05:46.295 --> 05:47.171
Okay, so check it out.

05:47.296 --> 05:48.473
Here, I drew you a little map.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.433
Just go ahead and follow
that line that I drew,

05:50.599 --> 05:51.375
and you'll be good.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.376
He drew us a map.

05:52.501 --> 05:53.477
Oh, that's so clutch.

05:53.602 --> 05:54.812
- That's so clutch.
- What a guy.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.847
Hey, do you guys want
some grapes for your journey?

05:56.972 --> 05:57.848
No, we're good.

05:57.973 --> 05:59.116
Not really, dude.

05:59.241 --> 06:01.987
Wow, this is great.
Thank you so much, Karl.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.087
Yeah, no problem.

06:03.212 --> 06:04.614
Oh, wait, hold...
Karl, is there, like,

06:04.780 --> 06:06.366
a password we need or anything?

06:06.532 --> 06:07.659
There's not a password.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.494
- Drug dealers have those.
- Hey-yo, maggots!

06:09.660 --> 06:11.037
- There's a password.
- Yep.

06:11.203 --> 06:12.372
- There ya go.
- Okay, cool.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.998
Hey-yo, maggots.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.419
I cannot wait to meet
these class acts.

06:21.931 --> 06:23.298
Can I help you?

06:25.334 --> 06:27.804
Hey-yo, maggots!

06:27.970 --> 06:29.639
- What?
- Eww!

06:29.805 --> 06:31.307
Maggots!

06:31.473 --> 06:33.117
Excuse me? I...

06:33.242 --> 06:34.585
Uh, I'm sorry on our behalf.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.520
Guys, wrong house, I'm telling you.

06:36.645 --> 06:37.788
No, no, no, no.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.457
We're here for the... passports.

06:39.582 --> 06:42.152
We're friends with... Karl.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.127
Oh!

06:43.252 --> 06:45.030
Oh, Karl!

06:45.196 --> 06:46.997
Oh, yes, of course.
Come on in!

06:47.122 --> 06:48.899
What was that about the maggots?

06:49.024 --> 06:49.900
You tell us.

06:50.025 --> 06:51.735
Misunderstanding.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.170
Sorry.

06:53.295 --> 06:57.751
Uh, just to clear things up,
you know Karl hevacheck?

06:57.917 --> 07:01.337
Uh, the guy who doesn't wear
underwear and has a dirt beard?

07:01.503 --> 07:03.180
Yeah. Karl and I go way back.

07:03.305 --> 07:05.800
He used to play keyboards
at my church.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.427
Okay, you're blowing my mind.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.847
'Cause he's Karl,
and you have impeccable taste.

07:11.013 --> 07:11.922
Why, thank you!

07:12.047 --> 07:13.224
This is very nice.
Restoration hardware?

07:13.390 --> 07:14.325
Oh, you know what?

07:14.450 --> 07:16.478
Believe it or not,
it's actually pier one.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.595
Get out!

07:17.720 --> 07:18.996
- Ha ha ha! I know.
- That's pier one.

07:19.121 --> 07:20.690
I don't know what that means.

07:20.856 --> 07:22.900
Can I get you boys anything?
Some water or milk?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.903
Uh, a low-carb Red Bull?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.571
- Oh...
- Tired right now!

07:26.737 --> 07:28.740
Or some shark bites or gushers?

07:28.906 --> 07:30.174
We don't have
any sugar in this house.

07:30.299 --> 07:31.117
I think we're okay.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.744
Blake, if you would just get to it?

07:32.910 --> 07:34.078
I actually need a passport,

07:34.203 --> 07:37.832
and I heard that you and Dale
are the people to talk to.

07:37.998 --> 07:39.450
Dale is my ex.

07:39.575 --> 07:41.961
And we don't use that name
in this house.

07:42.127 --> 07:43.797
Is this something that was recent?

07:46.423 --> 07:49.177
Anywho, if you could
just get me your picture...

07:49.343 --> 07:50.094
Yeah, absolutely.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.095
Mm-hmm.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.555
Here it is, right here.

07:52.721 --> 07:53.631
That's me with the long hair.

07:53.756 --> 07:55.475
Oh, how cute.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
Well, I can have that passport
ready in a few days.

07:58.143 --> 07:59.354
No. No, no, no, no.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.372
We need that, like, now,
if you could.

08:01.497 --> 08:03.358
Yeah, our flight is in,
like, five hours.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.860
Oh, then I can't help you, then.

08:06.026 --> 08:07.779
Ma'am, please, can't you please,

08:07.945 --> 08:08.846

08:08.971 --> 08:10.615
I'll be your best friend.

08:10.781 --> 08:11.916
Guys, tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.217
I have to go to the grocery store,

08:13.342 --> 08:15.245
I have to pick up my son
from wrestling practice.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.555
I'm great at picking up sons!
That's my... that's my forte.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:18.981 --> 08:19.857
You stay home, we'll be,
like, your little butlers.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.058
It'll be great.

08:21.183 --> 08:22.377
You could probably
finish it in time, right?

08:22.543 --> 08:23.961
Well, I mean, in theory,
of course I could.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.996
We can be your grocery genies!

08:26.121 --> 08:27.431
Yeah, make a wish, poof!
It arrives.

08:27.556 --> 08:28.633
No, no, no.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.467
Hang on, hang on.
Let me show you something.

08:30.592 --> 08:31.569
This is my driver's license.

08:31.694 --> 08:32.903
Clean record, okay?

08:33.028 --> 08:34.871
I've got insurance, triple-a
card... member since 2007.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.340
So responsible, very responsible.

08:36.465 --> 08:39.143
You have the hardest job
in the world.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.312
You're a single mother.
I was raised by a single mother.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.606
And also stone cold
Steve Austin via TV.

08:43.772 --> 08:46.216
And we'll pay
for your groceries, Bets.

08:46.341 --> 08:48.018
I'm talkin' whole foods,
the good stuff.

08:48.143 --> 08:49.019

08:49.144 --> 08:52.690
Help us help you help yourself

08:52.815 --> 08:55.827
while also helping us.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.776
Oh, God!
Let me get the list.

08:58.901 --> 09:01.829
- Yes!
- Hey-oh! Maggots!

09:09.840 --> 09:12.385
Buddy, drop it, all right?

09:12.551 --> 09:14.903
Let's just get this guy
and get him home.

09:15.028 --> 09:16.705
Just saying if Betsy's
gonna make stuffing,

09:16.830 --> 09:18.774
she's gonna wish she had
craisins and I'm dropping it.

09:18.899 --> 09:19.775
Wait, there he is.

09:19.900 --> 09:20.602

09:25.564 --> 09:27.950
Yeah, my mom texted me,
but I'm not going.

09:28.075 --> 09:30.236
What?
We got snarks, dude.

09:30.402 --> 09:32.822
They were out of gushers,
but I got some licorice.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.857
Come on! Come on!

09:34.982 --> 09:35.825
Come on! Go get it!

09:35.991 --> 09:37.827
Go, guy!

09:37.993 --> 09:38.827
I don't get that.

09:38.952 --> 09:40.095
That worked on me as a kid.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.623
- That is weird, huh?
- That's a good trick.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.041

Hey, Damien...

09:45.417 --> 09:46.969
Hey, calm your old ass down.

09:47.094 --> 09:48.171
Tell my mom I'll be home later.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.464
Maybe.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.840
- Later maybe...
- Ders, Ders!

09:51.006 --> 09:53.609
Hey, little dude, you need
to show your elder dudes

09:53.734 --> 09:54.969

09:55.135 --> 09:56.311
Now come with us

09:56.436 --> 09:58.080

making us fake passports.

09:58.205 --> 09:59.807
Get the fuck away from me,
you longhaired jizz expert!

09:59.973 --> 10:02.451
Okay, no one talks to my
longhaired jizz expert

10:02.576 --> 10:03.452

but we're back on track.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.046
Picked up a real nice lad.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.745
- Hide the car!
- That doesn't make any sense!

11:02.911 --> 11:03.712
You can't hide the car!

11:39.339 --> 11:40.366
You can't lock somebody in a car.

Uh, I don't know if you know this,

15:56.472 --> 15:57.682
And the more that I think about it,

15:57.807 --> 15:59.208
we should act out, like,
a Pocahontas situation

15:59.374 --> 16:00.551
with some leathery Hedo babes.

16:00.676 --> 16:01.919
Like, that would be awesome, right...

16:02.044 --> 16:03.462
Am I rambling a little bit?
I'm excited.

16:03.628 --> 16:05.690
No, no, you're not rambling.
We're all on the same page.

16:05.815 --> 16:07.225
- Pocahontas sounds great but...
- Thank you.

16:07.350 --> 16:08.226
I don't know, man.

16:08.351 --> 16:10.862
It just doesn't seem right.

16:10.987 --> 16:11.887
I say we call it.

16:12.053 --> 16:12.847
Yeah.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.099
We did spend $400 nonrefundable.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.968
Okay, so we definitely
have to go on this trip!

16:17.093 --> 16:18.436
We just gotta find that kid!

16:18.602 --> 16:19.504
Yes.

16:19.629 --> 16:21.731
- Well, maybe if we...
- Hey, guys.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.482
Thing's not gonna suck itself.

16:23.648 --> 16:25.376
Ooh!

16:25.501 --> 16:26.377
Holy meat rod!

16:26.502 --> 16:27.945
That is a real bat.

16:28.111 --> 16:29.113
Real meat stick.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.699
Hey, Gerald!
Is that you?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.618
Hey, Dan, the man with the mouth.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.620
I can't give this thing away today.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.954
Hey, do you know where Jimmy is?

16:37.079 --> 16:37.955
- Is he around?
- Oh, I wish.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.165
No. Andy's good, though.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.666
What, Andy the golf pro?

16:40.832 --> 16:41.692
No, black Andy. That guy.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.127
Oh, sweet chocolate.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.211
Ha ha... oh, sorry.

16:44.377 --> 16:46.330
Reach around? Reach around?

16:46.455 --> 16:47.331
Anybody?

16:47.456 --> 16:49.634
- You guys?
- I'm good.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.539
Hey.
Full house tonight, huh?

16:54.664 --> 16:56.040
Now as I saying

16:56.165 --> 16:57.975
before we were so rudely interrupted,

16:58.141 --> 17:00.144
we're gonna smoke Damien out.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.612
Well, kind of.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.047
We're gonna pull this alarm,

17:03.172 --> 17:04.482
and then when everybody comes
rushing out of the theater,

17:04.607 --> 17:06.150
- we'll grab him.
- Mm-hmm.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.276
Okay, Blake,
that's... that's actually genius.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.086
It's also illegal.

17:09.211 --> 17:10.988
I think we're stacking crimes
pretty high today.

17:11.154 --> 17:13.156
Ders, desperate times
calls for desperate measuring.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.392
And it's not illegal.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.868
I've done it personally,
like... like 14 times.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.162
Middle school was wild.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.080
Blake, it's illegal.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.958
Bug that.
I ain't never scared.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.919
Don't move!
On the floor!

17:25.085 --> 17:26.935
I didn't touch it, I swear!

17:32.884 --> 17:34.865
- I said down.
- Oh, do we have to?

17:34.990 --> 17:36.066
It's like really gross.
Okay, okay, sure, yep.

17:36.191 --> 17:39.703
It's really sticky, actually.

17:39.828 --> 17:41.505
Are you the owners
of the Volvo parked out front

17:41.630 --> 17:42.645
with the crappy paint job?

17:42.811 --> 17:44.605
Why? Did someone ding my car?

17:44.771 --> 17:45.976
Where's the kid?

17:46.101 --> 17:47.983
What in the hell is going on here?

17:48.149 --> 17:49.318
Just stand aside and relax, sir.

17:49.484 --> 17:51.281
No, I will not.
This is my place of business.

17:51.406 --> 17:52.405
I've got permits.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.650
Sir, these men are involved

17:53.775 --> 17:54.865
in the kidnapping of a minor.

17:55.031 --> 17:56.409
No, no, no!
We didn't kidnap anybody...

17:56.575 --> 17:57.910
No, no!
There he is, ask him!

17:58.076 --> 17:59.954
Whoa, hold on.
That's my son.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.580
Now, Damien, you get out here.

18:02.017 --> 18:04.728
Did these guys try to
kidnap you or something?

18:04.853 --> 18:06.096
No, listen, please.

18:06.221 --> 18:08.131
We were sent to pick him up
by his mom

18:08.256 --> 18:09.630
while she was gonna make...

18:09.796 --> 18:11.507
Look, we're friends with Betsy.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.803
We know Betsy.

18:12.928 --> 18:13.937
Yeah, we're friends with Betsy.

18:14.062 --> 18:15.172
Yeah, we know Betsy.

18:15.297 --> 18:16.807
Yeah, I mean,
we forced him in the car,

18:16.932 --> 18:18.575
but that's just 'cause he's,
like, really, really strong.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.141
He should be in <i>American Gladiator.</i>

18:20.307 --> 18:22.279
Is anything that they're saying true?

18:22.404 --> 18:24.714
Yeah. I just didn't
want to go home to mom

18:24.839 --> 18:26.105
because I wanted to hang out
with you,

18:26.271 --> 18:27.417
and... and maybe see if we could

18:27.542 --> 18:29.820
all eat Thanksgiving
together tomorrow.

18:29.945 --> 18:31.488
Like we used to.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.857
- Oh, that's sweet.
- That's beautiful.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.073
This carpet smells like semen.

18:36.239 --> 18:38.534
Yep, I found a semen.
That is semen right there.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.530
- We're just gonna get up.
- No, back down.

18:40.655 --> 18:42.265
Going back down.
Oh, we'll go back down.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.039
Don't point that.

18:44.205 --> 18:45.875
It's just semen.
Stop whining.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.105
So, I'm leaving.

18:49.230 --> 18:51.213
But you're still parked
in a red zone, kid.

18:51.379 --> 18:53.910
And don't check
"not guilty" by accident

18:54.035 --> 18:55.384
and drag my ass into court, okay?

18:55.550 --> 18:57.261
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get out of here.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.847
Thank you, Officer.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.186
I am so sorry
about all this confusion.

19:03.311 --> 19:05.255
It's just... ever since our divorce,

19:05.380 --> 19:06.729
it's been very hard on Damien.

19:06.895 --> 19:10.316
Hey, my parents are divorced.
Holidays are rough.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.295
Nobody cares, crybaby.

19:12.420 --> 19:13.964
Well, he should've listened
to his mother.

19:14.089 --> 19:16.030
He knows he's not supposed
to come to my picture house.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.859
Picture house?
This is a porno theater, dude.

19:19.407 --> 19:20.659
Own it, man.
It's cool.

19:20.825 --> 19:22.328
Anyway, we gotta get Damien
back to the house pronto.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.662
Well, what's the rush?

19:23.828 --> 19:25.372
Betsy's making Blake a fake passport.

19:25.538 --> 19:26.749
Oh.

19:26.915 --> 19:27.777
Yeah, we've got flight to Hedonism II

19:27.902 --> 19:28.812
in, like, a couple of hours,

19:28.937 --> 19:29.877
so we better get going.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.671
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:32.837 --> 19:35.800
I love Hedonism.
Ah!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.301
Oh, cool!

19:37.467 --> 19:39.155
Where do you think this
little rascal was conceived?

19:39.280 --> 19:40.991
Dad!

19:41.116 --> 19:42.431
Hedonism, really?

19:42.597 --> 19:44.350
Well, no, but an orgy just like it.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.727
- Hey.
- I think he's mine.

19:48.895 --> 19:50.867
- It's a joke we have.
- Dad!

19:50.992 --> 19:52.107
- Oh, come on.
- Stop.

19:52.273 --> 19:54.652
- See you, guys.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

19:54.818 --> 19:55.986
You too.
Gobble gobble.

19:56.152 --> 19:59.740
Oh, and, Damien.

20:03.827 --> 20:04.870
Later!

20:05.036 --> 20:06.883
I think we brought a family together

20:07.008 --> 20:08.685
just in time for Thanksgiving.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.820
- I think you're right.
- Get off me!

20:10.945 --> 20:12.022
I'm not on you.

20:12.147 --> 20:13.690
You and your stupid porn theater!

20:13.815 --> 20:16.493
- What is your problem?
- Let's get weird!

20:16.618 --> 20:19.429
Let's get weird!
We're getting weird!

20:19.554 --> 20:21.031
We're getting weird!

20:21.156 --> 20:23.500
We-we-we-we-we-we-we

20:23.625 --> 20:26.169
we-we-we-we-we-we we-we-we-we

20:26.294 --> 20:27.184
we'll get so fucking weird.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.641
♪ ♪

20:31.766 --> 20:34.483
So, did we save room for dessert?

20:34.649 --> 20:38.028
Where are all the titties
and butt cheeks?

20:38.194 --> 20:41.574
Probably having Thanksgiving
with their families.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.200
That's... stupid.

20:43.366 --> 20:47.057
So, how's that Jamaican
jerk lasagna treating you?

20:47.182 --> 20:49.650
Hmm.

20:49.775 --> 20:51.292
It's fucking gross, Mike.
