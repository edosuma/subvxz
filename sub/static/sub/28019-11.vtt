13:05.219 --> 13:07.612
WOMAN:
Copy that, Team Two.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.358
Hey.
Hey.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.013
The good news is, I found
somewhere safe to put Cortez.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.798
The ambassador's office

13:18.841 --> 13:21.539
is built to function
as a safe room in an emergency.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.455
The bad news is,
Cortez is refusing.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.110
He says he isn't a man
who runs and hides.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.156
He's putting himself
in jeopardy.Yeah,

13:29.199 --> 13:30.331
he's clear on that.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.028
Anything?

13:32.072 --> 13:34.683
Well, if you were
gonna hide something or...

13:34.726 --> 13:36.163
leave it for later,

13:36.206 --> 13:38.469
where would
you put it?

13:45.868 --> 13:47.130
Eric.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.700
That's Kate's.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.096
What are you doing here?

13:56.139 --> 13:57.184
This is an active
crime scene.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.620
We're just trying
to figure out...

13:58.663 --> 14:00.274
Put your hands
behind your heads!

14:01.971 --> 14:04.756
What's in the purse?CYNTHIA:
We don't know.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.062
We just found it
in the garbage.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.803
Empty the contents
in the sink.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.587
ERIC: We believe someone
may have smuggled a weapon

14:09.631 --> 14:12.155
into the embassy,
so be careful.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.034
What is this?

14:21.077 --> 14:23.123
Well, that's evidence.
I-I wouldn't touch it

14:23.166 --> 14:25.125
if I...[sniffs, exhales]

14:25.168 --> 14:26.561

drugs here?

14:28.998 --> 14:30.434

14:33.394 --> 14:36.353
[grunting]CYNTHIA:
We need a medic.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.226
ERIC:
D-Don't touch him.Yes, yes.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.754
A single drop
of whatever is in that vial

14:45.797 --> 14:47.538
was enough to put a marine
in a coma.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.801
And since the vial is empty,
we have to assume

14:49.845 --> 14:51.542
that the substance
is still in the building.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.283
That is a live threat.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.937
I need to talk to Kate.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.286
You know I can't
authorize that.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.505
If she knows something,

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
who better
to get it out of her than me?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.726
Look, the CIA is coming to
take over in 30 minutes.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.467
They're handling this.Just give me that time.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.121
Let me find out
what's really going on.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.775
WEAVER:
Ambassador McMillan.Yes?

15:06.818 --> 15:08.777
We found an explosive.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.083
Our team is working
to disarm it,

15:10.126 --> 15:11.345
but we have to assume
there are more.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.694
We can't evacuate now.

15:12.737 --> 15:13.825
And I'm supposed to act
like everything's fine?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.088
Well, for now.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.742
Informing the guests
would cause mass panic.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.483
Let me help you.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.572
Help with what?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.661
You're not
gonna like it.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.538
[door opens]

15:33.584 --> 15:36.413
Don't tell me they've
asked youto take over.

15:39.329 --> 15:42.680
ERIC:
Thought you'd like to see
a friendly face.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.466
How are you doing?

15:45.509 --> 15:47.816
I'm sorry I ruined
your party.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.601
I need you
to tell me everything.

15:50.645 --> 15:53.213
Start at the beginning.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.129
You're actually
interrogating me?

15:56.172 --> 15:59.828
RSO Weaver contacted the FBI.
They have no record

15:59.871 --> 16:01.656
of an altercation
at the event you described.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.442
No suspicious man backstage.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.140
No gun in a dumpster.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.576
Nothing.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.232
Hmm?

16:12.275 --> 16:15.409
What's going on
here, Kate?

16:18.281 --> 16:20.283
We found this
in the washroom.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.503
There was a vial
of liquid in it.

16:23.547 --> 16:26.463
It contained a...
a nerve agent.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.685
Nothing to say?

16:30.728 --> 16:32.252
This is way above
your pay grade.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.818
What's above
my pay grade?

16:33.862 --> 16:36.865
You need to get out of here
while you still can.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.040
Why?

16:38.084 --> 16:40.042
What's happening tonight?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.873
I was ordered to kill that man.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.268
By whom?

16:48.311 --> 16:51.488
What did I just say
about pay grades?

16:52.533 --> 16:54.970
Why did you kill him?

16:56.450 --> 16:59.061
I killed him
to get him out of the way,

16:59.105 --> 17:02.151
because someone is
still going to die tonight.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.851
You needed me
to get access to the party.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.333
That's why you pushed
to come here.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.248
Mm-hmm.

17:12.291 --> 17:16.252
So all these months, I've...

17:16.296 --> 17:18.950
I've just been
a means to an end?

17:24.086 --> 17:25.261
Yes.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.452
Eric...

17:42.496 --> 17:44.106
I don't know
what to say.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.239
[phone ringing]I can't believe it.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.026
Zara, what'd you find out?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.594
Someone accessed
the Cri/Res server

17:53.637 --> 17:56.162
from your laptop.What were they looking for?

17:56.205 --> 17:58.773
A series of case files
were copied.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.818
Why would Kate want
your Cri/Res files?

18:00.862 --> 18:01.993
You think it was Kate?

18:02.037 --> 18:03.691
Looks that way.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.127
Zara, the embassy's on lockdown.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.303
It's gonna be hard
to get back in, but stay close,

18:07.347 --> 18:08.826
and, um, just be ready

18:08.870 --> 18:11.220
if I call.All right. Standing by.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.789
Hey.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.138
I'm sorry.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.881
I don't understand
how I could be so blind.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.144
She fooled us all.CIA will be here soon.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.972
Maybe it's best
we leave it to them.

♪

18:41.598 --> 18:43.034
No.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.820
I don't believe it.Eric, you heard
her yourself.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.388
She killed a CIA operative
in the Colombian embassy.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.868
Why? It doesn't make sense.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.219
It's not unheard of
for FBI agents

18:53.262 --> 18:55.134
to be corrupted
by Colombian cartels.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.309
CYNTHIA:
We did find
an empty vial

18:56.352 --> 18:58.441
of nerve agent in her clutch.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.226
I can't just accept
that the woman I spent

19:00.269 --> 19:02.532
the last six months with
is some kind of double agent.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.230
You need to change
Cortez's mind,

19:04.273 --> 19:05.709
get him to
the safe room.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.363
I'm gonna go back in with Kate.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.887
If there is any chance
she really is a killer,

19:09.931 --> 19:11.933
she needs
to convince me of that.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.982
[indistinct chatter]

19:19.158 --> 19:22.161
Mr. Cortez.
Can we have a minute?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.732
The assassination weapon
is a nerve agent.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.560
The marine guard
came into contact

19:30.604 --> 19:33.607
with a single drop
and barely survived.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.217
And...

19:35.261 --> 19:37.611
you think somebody here
wants to poison me?

19:37.654 --> 19:40.004
We can't say for sure,
but we want you to reconsider

19:40.048 --> 19:42.006
your decision
not to go to the safe room.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.400
Is something wrong?

19:44.444 --> 19:47.142
As you know, there's
endless threats on my life.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.363
But these good people want
to put me in a safe room.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.539
But you always say
you won't hide.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.454
Yes, cierto.
That's true.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.630
But tonight is
about the young people

19:56.673 --> 19:58.588
and the future of our country.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.199
You need to give
your speech.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.201
I will go.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.203
This way.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.597
The ambassador's office has
concrete walls reinforced

20:07.641 --> 20:10.600
by eight inches of steel
and also bulletproof windows.

to you, sir.

personal approval.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.269
Absolutely. You're
perfectly safe, sir.

20:27.313 --> 20:30.141
Much nicer than where
we kept our prisoners.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.927
Good to know.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.631
Why are you pretending?

20:41.675 --> 20:44.243
We both know that
you're not an assassin.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.418
I thought I told you to go.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.463
Okay, fine.
You know what, I'll play.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.117
Who are you working for?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.553
The cartels?

What is it gonna take
for you to get the message?

Answer the question.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.475
If you came here
to kill that man,

20:59.519 --> 21:01.695
why weren't you better prepared?

21:01.738 --> 21:03.305
He's dead.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.394
Seems pretty prepared to me.

You could've grazed his flesh

21:07.353 --> 21:09.398

21:09.442 --> 21:12.271
Man would have died. No one
would have been the wiser.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.055
Why go to the men's room?

21:14.098 --> 21:16.536
You had to know that
that would put him on alert.

21:16.579 --> 21:17.972
Maybe I killed him that way

21:18.015 --> 21:19.713
so that everybody
will be looking at me,

21:19.756 --> 21:22.716
when they really should be
looking somewhere else.

21:22.759 --> 21:23.934

than she's letting on.

You told me once

21:28.548 --> 21:30.419
that I should trust
my instincts.

My instincts
tell me that you

21:32.421 --> 21:33.901
are lying.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.337
Sorry, Eric.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
You were a plus-one

21:37.383 --> 21:39.298
That's it.

Why did you break into
my private files?

We found your trace
on the server.

Do you really want to know?

21:52.485 --> 21:54.225
I do.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.576
I was looking
into the Hemmigen case.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.665
What does that have
to do with this?

21:58.708 --> 22:00.580
Because you lied to me.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.669
I put my career on the line
for you,

22:02.712 --> 22:04.410
and you didn't have
the decency to tell me

22:04.453 --> 22:06.760
the main suspect
all but confessed to poisoning

22:06.803 --> 22:08.239
the insulin supply.
You withheld

22:08.283 --> 22:09.893
information from me
that could have led

22:09.937 --> 22:11.634
to a domestic terrorism
conviction.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.288
I tricked her
into giving us information

22:13.332 --> 22:15.682
that we knew
would stop the threat.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.337
More people
would've died.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.382
Why is it okay when you lie?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.341
Because you're a federal agent.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.777
You gave an oath.
You couldn't make

22:23.820 --> 22:25.039
that deal.
What, you think

I was lying

No.
No.

Exactly.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.577
Kate is lying
to protect me.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.274

I'm sorry. I'm not able
to make that kind of exception.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.724
Weaver was the
only person that had

interviewing her.

She must have threatened
her with something.

mean that Weaver

23:09.475 --> 23:11.390
faked that CIA dossier,

planted the vial
in Kate's purse,

There is still someone
at this party

And if Weaver is lying
about CIA intel,

that there is no CIA jet

This is all conjecture.

23:34.282 --> 23:37.416
She still has
jurisdictional authority here.

We need her to keep believing
that we're suspicious of Kate.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.724
We could go
to Ambassador McMillan.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.427
I'm not--
I'm not taking any chances.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.429
So what do we do?

23:50.472 --> 23:53.388
Let Kate know
we got her message.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.394
The poison?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.441
What about the room?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.833
There is no way in.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.487
Let me worry about that.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.446
You take care
of the FBI agent.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.665
And make it quick.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.711
Painless.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.372
I thought I got through
your thick skull, Beaumont.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.374
You did.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.464
You really think
I'm gonna let this go?

24:25.507 --> 24:27.596
That I won't do everything
in my power to make sure

24:27.640 --> 24:31.208
you get exactly
what you deserve?

24:32.253 --> 24:35.212
You always were a man
with a plan.

24:35.256 --> 24:36.692
[footsteps approaching]

24:36.736 --> 24:39.347
CIA are waiting.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.609
Dante, my security assistant,

24:40.653 --> 24:42.481
will escort Agent Barrett
to the airport.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.483
ERIC:
Very good.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.355
Yeah, we'll...
take it from here.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.792
I just want to say good-bye.

24:52.882 --> 24:56.538
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.628
[Weaver clears throat]

25:13.642 --> 25:16.340
McMILLAN: Hello,
esteemed ladies and gentlemen.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.908
It was just two years ago
that a deal was brokered

25:18.952 --> 25:20.562
between the Colombian government

25:20.606 --> 25:23.347
and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia,

25:23.391 --> 25:25.349
the FARC,

25:25.393 --> 25:26.525
ending five decades

25:26.568 --> 25:29.919
of horrific bloodshed.

25:31.181 --> 25:35.446
So, does the CIA jet
have an in-flight movie?

25:37.274 --> 25:39.363
[indistinct chatter]

25:39.407 --> 25:40.190
Kate,

25:40.234 --> 25:41.365
where are you now?

25:41.409 --> 25:43.150
You guys gonna
make me wash dishes

25:43.193 --> 25:45.239
to pay for my sins?

25:45.282 --> 25:46.849
Kitchen.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.372
They're passing kitchens.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.548
You guys get that?

25:49.591 --> 25:51.593
Copy that.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.377
[sniffles]

25:53.421 --> 25:55.379
You're gonna hack a State
Department computer?

25:55.423 --> 25:57.294
I prefer "gently accessing."

25:58.339 --> 26:00.297
Okay, I just need a minute,
Eric.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.299
We don't have a minute.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.910
Kitchen.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.178
Oliver, anything?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.788
Just a second.
Almost there.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.312
You usually take suspects out
through a service entrance?

26:17.227 --> 26:18.533
ERIC:
Service entrance.
She's headed there.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.365
[panting, grunts]

26:24.408 --> 26:25.540
Párese. Hey.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.368
Take it easy, would ya?

26:27.411 --> 26:29.500
They don't call 'em
"killer heels" for nothing.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.894
[panting]

26:31.938 --> 26:34.201
McMILLAN:
I'm proud of the small part
the United States

26:34.244 --> 26:37.683
has played in bringing about
this crucial peace deal.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.772
Tonight is a night
where we celebrate

26:39.815 --> 26:41.556
the future of Colombia,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.384
its young people.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.865
And they have
no better role model

26:45.908 --> 26:47.867
than this young lady over here,

26:47.910 --> 26:50.217
Lucianna Rodriguez.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.262
[applause]

26:57.311 --> 27:00.009
[clears throat]

27:00.053 --> 27:04.231
I was a soldier in the FARC.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.711
[exhales]

27:05.754 --> 27:07.234
Okay, now I'm in some kind
of hallway.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.452
Which way do I go?

27:08.496 --> 27:10.672
Okay, there are three
service entrances.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.761
CYNTHIA:
Only one near a kitchen.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.328
East wing. There looks
to be a security blind spot.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.677
Okay, which way?

27:15.721 --> 27:16.635
Right.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.293
Okay, next right, then another
left, and then you're there.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.124
No. No.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.648
[rattling]

27:29.691 --> 27:31.127
I've hit a locked door.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.131
[panting]

27:35.175 --> 27:36.698
OLIVER:
Zara, there's a service entrance
at the back.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.092
Get there now.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.359
[exhales]

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
[panting]

28:02.419 --> 28:04.595
[grunting]

28:06.380 --> 28:07.947
[Dante groaning]

28:07.990 --> 28:09.383
[grunts][shouts]

28:09.426 --> 28:10.123
You okay?

28:10.166 --> 28:11.298
[Zara grunts]

28:11.341 --> 28:12.952
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.431
[Zara grunts]

28:14.475 --> 28:16.172
Don't give me any more reason
to shoot you.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.045
[panting]

28:19.088 --> 28:20.002
[handcuffs click]

28:20.786 --> 28:22.788
[panting]

28:24.615 --> 28:27.009
I'm sorry for what I said.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.271
I had no choice.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.925
Weaver said

28:29.969 --> 28:33.407
if I didn't do what she said,
she would have you killed.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.583
I know. I know.
It's okay. It's okay.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.020
It's okay.Did she say
if the target was Cortez?

28:38.064 --> 28:40.109
No. But she did say,

28:40.153 --> 28:41.545
because of me
killing her assassin,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.156
she'd have to take care
of things herself.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.549
So there's a good chance she's
got the nerve agent on her.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.943
She say anything about
Ambassador McMillan?

28:47.987 --> 28:49.945
She warned me not
to say a word to him.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.425
Well, if she didn't want
you tipping him off,

28:51.468 --> 28:52.426
that means
he's not involved.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.862
We need to talk to him.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.385
He's the only one with
the authority to stop her.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.604
Come on.

28:58.780 --> 29:03.393
I grew up knowing
only war and violence.

29:03.437 --> 29:07.484
My sister and I were recruited
as children.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.486
She was six.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.140
I was ten.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.664
On the first day,

29:13.708 --> 29:16.319
before we knew
what was to come,

29:16.363 --> 29:19.758
my sister asked me
what we would have to do.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.064
[quietly]:
Ambassador,

29:22.108 --> 29:23.892
we've identified
the assassin.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.067
Who?So...

29:25.111 --> 29:26.503
You need to come with me.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.766
...after all
the murder,

29:27.809 --> 29:29.419
bloodshed,

29:29.463 --> 29:30.986
even torture,

29:31.030 --> 29:33.815
people ask me
how I can accept

29:33.859 --> 29:37.297
the fact that the FARC
have been given their freedom.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.432
What did you do?

29:42.476 --> 29:44.608
She's supposed
to be in custody.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.872
It's not what I did,
it's what your RSO did.

29:46.915 --> 29:47.873
Weaver?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.049
She tried to have me killed.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.487
She's the one behind the
assassination attempt tonight.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.272
Eric...
I know you think
I'm being swayed

29:56.316 --> 29:57.534
by my emotion, I'm not.

29:57.578 --> 29:58.840
KATE: Straight from
the FBI servers,

29:58.884 --> 30:02.278
the report on the man
I killed in the bathroom.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.497
Weaver said she contacted
the FBI

30:03.540 --> 30:05.455
and they'd never heard of him.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.544
This corroborates everything
I said about him, and more.

30:07.588 --> 30:08.415
Weaver lied.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.721
He was ex-CIA.

30:10.765 --> 30:13.855
Weaver was also ex-CIA.
They came up together.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.510
He was selling his services
as a professional assassin.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.642
She threatened me to keep me
silent because she knew

30:18.686 --> 30:20.819
if we pushed for that report,
we'd find that connection.

30:22.472 --> 30:25.649
I can't believe she'd do this.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.135
We need to stop Weaver.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.745
But Cortez is the target.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.399
He's in the safe room,
she can't get to him there.

30:36.443 --> 30:37.705
OLIVER:
Well, she knew that

30:37.748 --> 30:39.794
and still proceeded
with her plan to kill Kate.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.579
This suggests her operation
is still in play.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.408
And what if Cortez isn't
the target after all?

30:45.452 --> 30:47.584
Find her.

30:47.628 --> 30:50.457
What can you tell me
about her?

30:52.067 --> 30:54.548
I knew she was former CIA.

30:54.591 --> 30:57.203
She ran covert ops, assisting
the Colombian government

30:57.246 --> 30:58.900
when the FARC were at the height
of their power.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.946
I mean, that's why I hired her.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.470
She had so much experience
in this country.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.733
Can you access her CIA file?

31:05.776 --> 31:07.082
Depends on her
security level.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.302
I can try.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.825
LUCIANNA:
How can I accept the fact

31:10.869 --> 31:14.002
that the FARC has been given
their freedom,

31:14.046 --> 31:15.874
even allowed to participate

31:15.917 --> 31:18.224
in the political process,

31:18.267 --> 31:20.008
get elected
to the highest office?

31:21.705 --> 31:25.100
In answer, I can only invite
every one of you

31:25.144 --> 31:27.798
to search your souls.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.540
KATE:
Okay. Most of this is redacted.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.803
She served in the field
in Colombia.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.545
She and her CIA team were
ambushed by the FARC.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.591
She was the only one
who made it out alive.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.593
I had no idea.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.769
I'm amazed she asked
to come back here.

31:41.812 --> 31:44.293
She wanted to come here?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.947
McMILLAN:
Yes. She contacted me

31:45.991 --> 31:47.035
about the position.

31:47.079 --> 31:51.474
She was very persistent.

31:51.518 --> 31:56.044
LUCIANNA:
Discover for yourselves
what you feel about crime

31:56.088 --> 31:58.568
and justice and forgiveness...No sign of her over here.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.093
...and amnesty.Nothing here.

32:01.136 --> 32:04.357
I can only tell you that
I'm embracing the future...

32:04.400 --> 32:05.880
Zara, behind you![gunshots]

32:05.924 --> 32:07.969
[crowd screaming][Zara grunts]

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
[indistinct shouting, screaming]

32:10.102 --> 32:11.973
WOMAN:
It's okay.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.583
Lucianna was the target?

32:13.627 --> 32:14.715
We need to get her
somewhere safe.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.673
[indistinct chatter]

32:16.717 --> 32:19.589
McMILLAN:
Everyone, please, remain calm.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.678
The embassy is in lockdown
due to a security threat.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.553
CORTEZ:
¿Qué pasó?
Why are you here?

32:26.596 --> 32:28.729
Someone shot at me.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.252
¿Qué?
Are you all right?

32:30.296 --> 32:31.427
I'm fine.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.212
You'll be safe now.

32:35.823 --> 32:40.001
They just thought I'd
be better off in here.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.003
And I'm glad.

32:42.047 --> 32:46.181
Now you and I have
a chance to talk.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.143
What do you mean?

32:51.186 --> 32:53.536
After the night we've had...

32:57.453 --> 32:59.803
...will you join me for a drink?

33:07.246 --> 33:08.290
[door opens]

33:10.205 --> 33:12.033
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't enjoy

33:12.077 --> 33:13.600
how the tables have turned.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.038
You need to tell us where
the nerve agent is,

33:17.082 --> 33:20.911
and whether you're working
with anyone else.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.001
What can we do for you
to make that happen?

33:24.611 --> 33:27.092
I have nothing to say.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.442
You hired your ex-colleague

33:29.485 --> 33:32.662
and got him access
to the building.

33:32.706 --> 33:36.101
But you didn't count on me
recognizing his scorpion tattoo.

33:36.144 --> 33:39.321
ERIC:
When he wound up dead,
you improvised,

33:39.365 --> 33:41.889
framed Kate.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.891
You knew you needed to keep
everyone in the building

33:43.934 --> 33:47.590
if you wanted a chance to finish
the job, so you had one

33:47.634 --> 33:49.636
of your people call in
a bomb threat.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.942
You even managed
to plant a bomb.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.423
Does that sound about right?

33:54.467 --> 33:57.861
ERIC:
Here's what I
don't understand.

33:57.905 --> 34:00.168
Why Lucianna?

34:00.212 --> 34:03.084
What did she do to you?

34:03.128 --> 34:06.000
And you had the nerve agent,
so why use a gun to kill her?

34:06.044 --> 34:07.567
Why not just poison her?

34:07.610 --> 34:10.831
You shot at a public figure
in a room full of witnesses.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.356
We both know there's no
coming back from that.

34:16.750 --> 34:20.928
If that's true, there's nothing
you can offer me.

34:21.668 --> 34:24.062
We know as CIA you were embedded

34:24.105 --> 34:28.109
with the Colombian military
against the FARC.

34:28.152 --> 34:31.156
We know you lost people,
colleagues,

34:31.199 --> 34:34.507
friends... a lover.

34:34.550 --> 34:39.686
You have no idea what I lost.

34:39.728 --> 34:42.384
Enough that you feel it's worth
killing a young woman.

34:42.428 --> 34:46.518
A woman who herself
was a victim of the FARC.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.129
WEAVER:
You're right
about one thing.

34:48.172 --> 34:51.567
Lucianna deserves justice.

34:51.610 --> 34:53.134
You have no idea
what we suffered.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.703
What do you mean,
"Lucianna deserves justice"?

34:56.746 --> 34:59.532
Eric, she's suppressing.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.665
She wants to talk,
but she's trying not to.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.103
She's buying time,
waiting for something.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.974
You know Lucianna.

35:14.503 --> 35:19.726
Do you know what's going
on out there tonight?

35:19.769 --> 35:22.294
I do.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.731
I can tell you
all about it.

35:24.774 --> 35:28.865
After all the pain you caused,

35:28.909 --> 35:30.911
there are people everywhere

35:30.954 --> 35:34.088
who can't forgive
what you've done.

35:34.132 --> 35:38.919
Even on a night like this,
celebrating you,

35:38.962 --> 35:43.053
there's always going to be
someone in the crowd

35:43.097 --> 35:45.447
who can't forget
the blood you shed.

35:49.016 --> 35:51.671
Eric, Lucianna's
sister was killed

35:51.714 --> 35:53.194
by the FARC for
trying to escape

35:53.238 --> 35:55.022
at a place called
Case Verde.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.806
It's the same place
Weaver was embedded

35:56.850 --> 35:58.068
with the Colombian military.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.245
You were there...

36:00.288 --> 36:03.073
when Lucianna's sister died.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.293
Why don't you tell me about her?

36:05.337 --> 36:07.600
WEAVER:
What's there to tell?

36:07.643 --> 36:10.864
What difference would it make,

36:10.907 --> 36:15.173
if she was tall, short,
blonde, brunette?

36:15.216 --> 36:16.957
She was a child.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.395
Ambassador,

36:20.439 --> 36:22.049
you call yourself a patriot?

36:22.092 --> 36:25.139
Standing up for a war criminal
becoming a president,

36:25.183 --> 36:26.923
making him our country's ally?

36:26.967 --> 36:28.490
You are not a patriot!

36:31.537 --> 36:33.756
You are a traitor.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.324
You weren't trying
to kill Lucianna,

36:36.368 --> 36:37.673
you just wanted us
to think you were,

36:37.717 --> 36:38.935
so we'd put her in with...

36:38.979 --> 36:40.154
Cortez.
Damn.

36:42.025 --> 36:45.942
I know how much
you have suffered.

36:45.986 --> 36:49.163
And I know how much
you must hate me,

36:49.207 --> 36:50.382
but we were at war.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.253
No more excuses!
No more talking!

36:52.297 --> 36:55.343
Don't move. Don't move.

36:55.387 --> 36:58.564
That's a nerve agent. One touch
of it will kill you, okay?

36:58.607 --> 37:00.087
Lucianna...

37:00.130 --> 37:03.090
I'm sure you've dreamed
of killing this man for years.

37:03.133 --> 37:06.049
No. No, I was never supposed

37:06.093 --> 37:08.487
to have to kill
anyone ever again.

37:08.530 --> 37:11.533
I was only supposed
to watch tonight.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.274
When the man with the scorpion
tattoo died,

37:13.318 --> 37:16.059
y-you had to become the killer?

37:16.103 --> 37:18.366
You put Cortez in this room.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.238
Even Francine
couldn't get in here.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.196
She never wanted me
to have to do this.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.591
Maybe it's fitting.

37:25.634 --> 37:28.028
He made me a killer.

37:28.071 --> 37:30.248
You're better than
what he made you.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.901
You've already proven that.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.773
He deserves to die.

37:33.816 --> 37:37.255
His men took me and my sister
from our beds

37:37.298 --> 37:39.126
in the middle of the night.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.084
She was an innocent.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.869
She was an angel.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.828
She went to bed every night
clinging to me,

37:45.872 --> 37:48.091
too terrified to sleep.

37:48.135 --> 37:51.269
And I admitted to that,
and I was pardoned

37:51.312 --> 37:54.359
for the future of our country.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.318
My sister didn't pardon you.

37:57.362 --> 38:00.756
They've all been pardoned.
Both sides.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.845
With one signature
from your president,

38:02.889 --> 38:05.021
they have been absolved
of their guilt.

38:05.065 --> 38:07.502
Now, I have no idea

38:07.546 --> 38:10.505
how horrible that must feel.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.986
He took your childhood;
he took your sister's life.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.728
Don't let him take the rest
of your life, too.

38:15.771 --> 38:20.167
My life doesn't matter anymore.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.777
ERIC:
Right now,

38:21.821 --> 38:24.911
what is more important?
The past?

38:24.954 --> 38:27.957
Or the future?

38:28.001 --> 38:30.133
You can't save anyone
from the pain of the past,

38:30.177 --> 38:34.050
but you can stop all the horrors
that will come

38:34.094 --> 38:36.183
from your country
falling back into chaos.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.359
How many more children need
to be taken

38:38.403 --> 38:40.143
from their beds at night?

38:49.065 --> 38:50.676
[whimpers]

39:00.990 --> 39:02.905
OFFICER:
This way.

39:02.949 --> 39:05.168
[indistinct chatter]

39:11.523 --> 39:14.308
OFFICER:
Stand back, ma'am.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.354
[indistinct chatter]

39:19.226 --> 39:20.619
[car engine starts]

39:20.662 --> 39:24.144
CYNTHIA:
They get a cop car,
he gets a limo ride.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.015
[car engine starts]

39:34.459 --> 39:38.680
I'm sorry. I'm sure you had
high hopes for tonight.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.552
I'm not naive.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.902
I'm well aware how terrible
the FARC's crimes were,

39:42.945 --> 39:45.034
and the government's, as well.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.906
But at some point,
don't people have to forgive?

39:46.949 --> 39:50.083
Is that too much to ask?

39:50.126 --> 39:52.999
I don't know.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.480
Have you seen Eric?

39:55.523 --> 39:58.004
I think he went
to go find Kate.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.266
Oh.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.009
Are we celebrating?

40:03.052 --> 40:05.533
Well, you're not dead.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.188
I'll drink to that.

40:12.235 --> 40:13.454
Look, I won't apologize

40:13.498 --> 40:16.109
for digging into
the Hemmigen files.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.632
But what I will say...

40:17.676 --> 40:20.287
You're not so sure that
we're good for each other.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.292
You know, I can't tell you that
I'll never withhold information

40:25.335 --> 40:28.338
from you to save a life.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.211
And I can't tell you
I'm not gonna snoop

40:31.254 --> 40:33.692
when I know you did.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.479
I just don't know if either
one of us is ever gonna put

40:38.523 --> 40:40.655
the other ahead
of our jobs.

40:42.918 --> 40:45.225
It's not the best thing.

40:45.268 --> 40:48.446
It's not
the worst thing, either.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.319
So...

40:52.362 --> 40:54.626
What now?

40:54.669 --> 40:56.845
I don't know.
