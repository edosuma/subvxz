00:58.515 --> 01:01.250
Time to move along, old fella.

01:01.284 --> 01:03.586
Oi! I said wake up.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.855
Or is it a visit to the cells you're after?

01:05.889 --> 01:09.024
Right then. Up with you.

01:09.058 --> 01:12.761
Oh, holy jumpin'...

01:29.599 --> 01:31.233
Dr. Grace. You're up and about very early.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.602
I was doing my morning
calisthenics, Detective.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.604
- Good for the heart and mind.
- I see.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.072
- What have you?
- Stab wound to the abdomen.

01:38.107 --> 01:40.029
Judging by the lack of
rigor, the victim's been dead

01:40.030 --> 01:43.177
- for many hours.
- Hmm. No sign of a struggle.

01:43.212 --> 01:46.347
Very little blood. I don't
believe he was killed here.

01:46.381 --> 01:49.751
- Oh? Who found him?
- I did, sir.

01:49.785 --> 01:51.753
Thought he was a tramp sleeping it off.

01:51.787 --> 01:54.055
Uh, you might want to
talk to this young man,

01:54.089 --> 01:56.057
he was here at first light.

01:56.091 --> 01:59.593
Birdwatcher, of all things.

01:59.628 --> 02:03.731
- Nigel Barnes, Detective.
- Good day, Mr. Barnes.

02:03.765 --> 02:05.899
I can't say I can be of much help.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.435
You didn't see anything out
of the ordinary this morning?

02:08.470 --> 02:11.204
I didn't. Not many frequent
the park at this hour.

02:11.239 --> 02:13.206
Actually,

02:13.241 --> 02:15.441
as I arrived, I saw a man leaving.

02:15.476 --> 02:18.544
- He seemed in quite a hurry.
- Really? Can you describe him?

02:18.579 --> 02:22.548
Yes. He had a long coat... Oh, and a beard.

02:22.583 --> 02:26.286
That's all I can remember.
Birds are more my interest.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.388
Thank you, Mr. Barnes.

02:31.158 --> 02:34.394
- Well dressed...
- Nothing to identify him,

02:34.428 --> 02:37.430
just this key and pages torn from a book.

02:37.464 --> 02:40.566
A novel, it seems.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.602
Odd.

02:42.936 --> 02:46.005
He appears to have dried
blood on his index finger.

02:46.039 --> 02:48.307
But very little blood on him or around him.

02:48.341 --> 02:51.911
So why would someone kill him,

02:51.945 --> 02:54.180
then leave his body in a public place?

02:54.214 --> 02:58.250
- Someone wanted him found.
- The question is why?

03:11.662 --> 03:14.730
Ah, sir. Someone to see you. An Owen Hume.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.467
He'll only talk to you.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.069
- Can I help you, Mr. Hume?
- Yes, Detective.

03:20.103 --> 03:22.872
My employer, Mr. Randolph
Sampson, is missing.

03:22.906 --> 03:25.007
Sampson. With... with a "P".

03:25.041 --> 03:27.009
Can you describe Mr. Sampson?

03:27.043 --> 03:30.580
He is 60. Grey hair. Not
tall, nor large in girth,

03:30.614 --> 03:34.383
and he takes great pride in his appearance.

03:34.417 --> 03:37.519
Please come with me, Mr. Hume.

03:37.553 --> 03:39.688
When did you last see Mr. Sampson?

03:39.722 --> 03:42.591
Two days ago. He left the
office as usual at 6 o'clock.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.427
- And what does he do?
- Mr. Sampson is a lawyer.

03:45.462 --> 03:48.964
I've been his clerk the past two years.

03:48.999 --> 03:53.001
Prepare yourself, Mr. Hume.

04:02.712 --> 04:07.215
That's him. Poor Mr. Sampson!

04:07.249 --> 04:09.217
So this clerk identified the corpse?

04:09.251 --> 04:11.486
Yes, sir. A Randolph Sampson.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.621
But there was no apparent
motive for the murder?

04:13.655 --> 04:17.024
No, sir. He seemed an ordinary
man with an ordinary life.

04:17.059 --> 04:19.427
- Any clue what happened?
- Well, sir,

04:19.461 --> 04:21.795
these pages were found
on Mr. Sampson's person.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.797
They're from a recent
novella by Mark Twain.

04:23.832 --> 04:27.100
Maybe he liked reading
three pages at a time.

04:27.135 --> 04:30.704
Pages 39, 81 and 146, sir?

04:30.739 --> 04:32.940
Oh, I see what you mean.

04:32.974 --> 04:35.643
Sir, where is Constable Crabtree?

04:35.677 --> 04:38.345
Medical school.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.781
Is George considering a career change?

04:40.815 --> 04:43.483
That was a joke, sir...

04:43.518 --> 04:46.486
Ah... I don't recall you making many
of those in the last 12 years, Murdoch.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.655
Oh, very good sir.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.793
It was there. Right there.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.829
A corpse simply doesn't
get up and walk away.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.765
Well clearly not, Dr. Dempsey.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.133
It must be found with all dispatch.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.403
The brain cannot deteriorate.
My research grant depends on it.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.239
- Sir?
- I am in the midst of proving

05:07.274 --> 05:09.508
a theory. I believe that high intelligence

05:09.543 --> 05:12.178
is correlated to a high
density of neurons in the brain.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.847
The cadaver was an eminent philosopher.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.016
A brilliant man. I need
to examine his brain.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.453
Right. What was the deceased's name, sir?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.688
Professor Andrew Richardson.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.856
And he, or it I suppose,

05:24.891 --> 05:26.858
- arrived here yesterday?
- Yes.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.590
As soon as I was notified of his death,

05:28.591 --> 05:30.943
I arranged for the delivery.
I've already told you, Constable,

05:30.945 --> 05:33.264
it was right here on this table.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.567
Doctor Dempsey, may I
ask, how do you go about

05:35.602 --> 05:37.603
choosing the right brain to cut up?

05:37.637 --> 05:41.006
I placed an excruciatingly
difficult puzzle in the newspaper.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.279
Those who responded correctly were invited

05:43.280 --> 05:44.942
to donate their brains to my research.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.512
- After they died, I assume?
- Ye...

05:47.546 --> 05:49.947
- Of course.
- Only one agreed.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.816
Professor Richardson.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.852
- This was no ordinary cadaver, Constable.
- No, clearly not.

05:54.886 --> 05:57.688
Uh...

05:57.723 --> 05:59.624
Doctor, do you have a photograph

05:59.658 --> 06:01.692
I could use for identification purposes?

06:01.727 --> 06:04.629
No, I do not. What the man
looked like is irrelevant to me.

06:04.663 --> 06:06.733
Just the contents of his skull.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.700
So Kathleen King has left us?

06:09.767 --> 06:14.138
- It would appear so.
- And the Furious Four?

06:14.172 --> 06:16.774
Is now the Terrible Three.

06:16.808 --> 06:20.344
What have we gained? 100
signatures on a petition.

06:20.378 --> 06:22.279
... Which was ripped up.

06:22.313 --> 06:25.649
And a demonstration which, despite the
fracas, hardly set the world on fire.

06:25.683 --> 06:27.851
So we need a bigger stage

06:27.885 --> 06:29.853
to put women's suffrage before the public.

06:29.887 --> 06:33.089
A provincial election is coming
up. Could we use that in some way?

06:33.124 --> 06:35.192
I don't see how.

06:35.226 --> 06:37.194
We'll gain no purchase

06:37.228 --> 06:39.195
from those stuffy sitting politicians.

06:39.229 --> 06:41.164
What if one of us were to run?

06:41.198 --> 06:43.667
- What do you mean?
- It would never occur

06:43.701 --> 06:46.369
to the legislature that a
woman would run for office.

06:46.403 --> 06:48.404
Perhaps they never bothered
to put it in writing.

06:48.438 --> 06:51.574
We're going to need a legal opinion.

06:51.608 --> 06:55.578
I know just the woman for the job.

07:09.726 --> 07:12.161
Mrs. Dewar, these pages
are from a recent novella

07:12.195 --> 07:15.397
by Mark Twain, A Double
Barrelled Detective Story.

07:15.431 --> 07:18.567
I understand your shop is the
only one in town that has a copy.

07:18.601 --> 07:21.503
Mysteries are my specialty, Detective.

07:21.537 --> 07:24.106
The story features Sherlock Holmes.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.274
I'm sure you'd find it quite illuminating.

07:26.309 --> 07:28.076
It's hot off the press.

07:28.110 --> 07:31.213
- So you do have a copy?
- Oh, I did, but it sold.

07:31.247 --> 07:33.448
- But I could order you another.
- Oh, I'm afraid

07:33.482 --> 07:35.917
I'm not much of one for novels.

07:35.951 --> 07:38.086
Do you know who you sold the book to?

07:38.120 --> 07:42.957
It was a regular of mine, Annie
Cranston. She works in Minnie's Tea Room.

07:42.991 --> 07:45.259
Quite the reader.

07:50.365 --> 07:52.433
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

07:52.467 --> 07:55.402
I'm looking for a waitress
here, a Miss Cranston.

07:55.437 --> 07:57.338
Oh, that's Annie.

07:57.372 --> 07:59.506
- She's over there.
- Thank you.

08:01.509 --> 08:05.613
Miss Cranston? Detective Murdoch
of the Toronto Constabulary.

08:05.647 --> 08:08.749
- Oh, good day, Detective!
- I understand you recently

08:08.783 --> 08:11.318
purchased a novella
from the Belair Bookshop?

08:11.353 --> 08:14.121
- Yes. By Mark Twain.
- May I see it?

08:14.155 --> 08:16.757
- Oh, I don't have it anymore.
- Why not?

08:16.791 --> 08:18.792
Someone took it. I left
the book on the counter,

08:18.826 --> 08:20.994
and when I came back to read
the next chapter after lunch,

08:21.028 --> 08:23.263
- it was gone.
- When was this?

08:23.297 --> 08:25.265
About 4 days ago.

08:25.299 --> 08:28.635
A cruel thing to do, take a
novel before one knows the ending.

08:28.669 --> 08:32.005
Do you recall if any of
the pages were missing?

08:32.039 --> 08:34.006
No.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.543
- Do you recognize this man?
- I'm sorry, no.

08:37.578 --> 08:41.447
Do you have time for tea?

08:41.482 --> 08:44.216
Oh, it would be a treat
for me to spend time with

08:44.251 --> 08:47.119
a real detective, not a figment
of a writer's imagination.

08:47.154 --> 08:49.355
Thank you, Miss Cranston,
but I must be off.

08:51.357 --> 08:54.894
I couldn't help but overhear.

08:54.928 --> 08:58.197
The day Annie's book
went missing, I saw a man

08:58.231 --> 09:01.366
rummaging about at the counter over here.

09:01.401 --> 09:03.468
If you ask me, he seemed to
know what he was looking for.

09:03.503 --> 09:07.539
- I see.
- Is this about a grisly murder, Detective?

09:07.573 --> 09:09.741
Not that I'm prying,

09:09.776 --> 09:12.311
or, uh... anything.

09:12.345 --> 09:18.082
- Is this the man that you saw?
- No, he was younger.

09:18.117 --> 09:20.885
More handsome.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.188
And you say you would
recognize him, Miss...

09:23.222 --> 09:26.424
Ruby Rosevear. Uh...

09:26.458 --> 09:28.726
Yes, I think that I would. I could

09:28.760 --> 09:32.230
draw a picture of him for
you... if I knew how to draw.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.506
Um...

09:42.541 --> 09:45.909
His beard was a bit thicker, I think.

09:45.944 --> 09:47.945
Thicker beard...

09:51.049 --> 09:54.485
What a clever thing this
is, Detective Murdoch.

09:54.519 --> 09:57.721
It was your idea, wasn't it?

09:57.755 --> 10:00.190
Go on, tell me. You invented it.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.727
Um, yes, yes. It can be quite useful.

10:03.761 --> 10:06.129
Mm. Thicker beard.

10:06.164 --> 10:09.432
That's him.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.434
That's him?

10:11.469 --> 10:13.135
All right, then.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.072
Miss Rosevear, what was he wearing?

10:16.106 --> 10:19.709
Uh, he was wearing a long coat.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.079
All in all, I think he
was quite shifty looking.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.049
"Shifty"...

10:27.084 --> 10:29.051
I know that the mind is
the seat of reason, George,

10:29.086 --> 10:31.087
and that the mind resides in the brain.

10:31.121 --> 10:34.490
Yes, but the brain is also the
dominion of the soul, Henry.

10:34.524 --> 10:36.492
Does that mean that the mind
and the soul are connected?

10:36.526 --> 10:38.494
Well, I suppose it's all in there.

10:38.528 --> 10:42.265
- Up there, if you will.
- So smarter people

10:42.299 --> 10:45.634
with great minds also
have larger souls, then?

10:45.668 --> 10:47.636
It doesn't seem right
they should have both.

10:47.670 --> 10:51.473
- I do hope that was a help.
- Yes, Miss Rosevear. Thank you.

10:51.508 --> 10:54.777
Oh... It's Ruby to you, Detective.

10:58.981 --> 11:00.949
George, I need your help.

11:00.983 --> 11:03.952
- Sir. I can't this afternoon. I'm off to Unionville.
- Unionville?

11:03.986 --> 11:05.987
Yes, sir. I'm on the
case of the missing brain.

11:06.022 --> 11:08.623
An entire cadaver,
actually, sir, but the brain

11:08.657 --> 11:11.092
is the most important part.
There's a Doctor Dempsey

11:11.127 --> 11:13.128
at the university, sir, he's researching

11:13.162 --> 11:15.263
the brains of highly intelligent people.

11:15.298 --> 11:17.299
You would be an excellent candidate, sir.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.500
... If you were dead, of course.

11:19.535 --> 11:22.115
- Have you searched the university?
- Sir, high and low.

11:22.138 --> 11:26.273
There's no sign of this corpse I am
off to Unionville now to try to find

11:26.308 --> 11:28.275
the widow of the corpse, as it were,

11:28.310 --> 11:30.878
- to see if she has a photograph.
- Does this corpse have a name?

11:30.913 --> 11:34.449
It does... or he does.
Would it be it or he for a...

11:34.483 --> 11:36.516
Uh, either way,

11:36.551 --> 11:38.785
his name is Professor Andrew Richardson.

11:38.820 --> 11:41.688
You'd be fascinated by
this, sir. Dr. Dempsey

11:41.722 --> 11:45.059
has all these cut-up brains in
jars, which of course is very eerie,

11:45.093 --> 11:47.127
but also, can't help remind me

11:47.162 --> 11:48.795
of my Aunt Rose's pickled cauliflower...

11:48.830 --> 11:52.332
- Thank you, George. Henry.
- Sir?

11:52.366 --> 11:55.502
I need you to fetch Nigel Barnes,
the birdwatcher from the park.

11:55.536 --> 11:57.938
- Right away, sir.
- Thank you.

11:59.941 --> 12:02.175
Any luck in the bookshop?

12:02.209 --> 12:05.311
Sir, the one copy of Mark Twain's novella

12:05.346 --> 12:08.448
was purchased by a young
waitress. It was later stolen,

12:08.482 --> 12:11.250
possibly by a man who was seen in the park.

12:11.285 --> 12:13.919
This same man may have
torn out the three pages

12:13.954 --> 12:16.189
and sent them to Mr. Sampson.

12:16.223 --> 12:18.191
Why would he do that?

12:18.225 --> 12:21.360
Well, sir, I've been analyzing
the contents of the pages,

12:21.375 --> 12:23.696
and I believe they may be
conveying a message of some sort.

12:23.730 --> 12:26.866
Have a look at page 39. There's a date:

12:26.900 --> 12:30.202
- June 19th.
- The day Sampson went missing.

12:30.236 --> 12:34.573
Yes, sir. Page 81; "7 in the evening".

12:34.608 --> 12:37.576
Where's this going, Murdoch?

12:37.611 --> 12:39.845
Well, sir, we have a time and a date.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.215
Page 146, there's a
character named Stillman.

12:43.249 --> 12:46.584
I've checked; there's a Stillman
Street down by the docks.

12:46.619 --> 12:50.889
The same page contains
the numbers 50, 60 and 70.

12:50.923 --> 12:55.527
I've checked the map and
Stillman extends to number 56.

12:55.561 --> 12:57.996
We need to pay 50 Stillman Street a visit.

13:00.766 --> 13:03.701
So Murdoch, how's
married life treating you?

13:03.736 --> 13:05.703
All well at the hotel?

13:05.738 --> 13:08.907
I'm happy to report that
it's an excellent arrangement.

13:09.301 --> 13:11.269
No one pays you any particular mind.

13:11.303 --> 13:13.271
What do you mean?

13:13.305 --> 13:16.440
Well, sir, at my boarding
house, the other residents...

13:16.474 --> 13:19.309
I was constantly being pulled into

13:19.343 --> 13:22.513
conversations of limited merit.

13:22.547 --> 13:24.782
I can only imagine the difficulty.

13:38.296 --> 13:40.297
Thank you.

13:45.869 --> 13:49.672
Some place for a meeting!

13:49.706 --> 13:51.707
Well, it doesn't look like
there's anything here, Murdoch.

13:54.978 --> 13:57.379
Sir...

14:04.687 --> 14:06.455
Constable,

14:06.489 --> 14:10.892
fetch my ultraviolet
light from the carriage.

14:13.763 --> 14:16.731
Poor bugger. This must
be where he met his end.

14:16.766 --> 14:20.336
Lured by the coded message.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.871
What is it?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.373
There's more, sir.

14:26.676 --> 14:28.844
"Blue Sky".

14:28.878 --> 14:31.346
What the bloody hell does that mean?

14:48.807 --> 14:50.635
_

14:53.608 --> 14:55.576
Gentlemen.

14:58.010 --> 15:02.148
Mr. Hume, does "Blue
Sky" mean anything to you?

15:02.183 --> 15:04.317
Blue Sky...

15:04.351 --> 15:06.987
I'm sorry, Detective. I never heard of it.

15:07.021 --> 15:09.355
And what kind of law
did Mr. Sampson practice?

15:09.390 --> 15:11.592
Largely patent law.

15:11.626 --> 15:13.659
Dry work for a clerk.

15:13.694 --> 15:15.661
Do you have a key for this drawer?

15:15.696 --> 15:17.663
Mr. Sampson kept that on his person.

15:17.698 --> 15:22.302
Sir, a key was found
in Mr. Sampson's pocket.

15:29.710 --> 15:32.845
Well, well, well. Mr. bloody Blue Sky.

15:35.181 --> 15:37.149
Anything?

15:37.243 --> 15:39.912
It appears to be an index

15:39.946 --> 15:43.448
for plans and technical
drawings of various inventions.

15:43.483 --> 15:47.118
"The honeycomb radiator
for an automobile... "

15:47.153 --> 15:49.954
But the plans themselves are missing.

15:49.989 --> 15:52.357
Did Mr. Sampson represent inventors?

15:52.392 --> 15:54.859
Yes. Several.

15:54.894 --> 15:59.164
Sir, I recall the prototype
for this radiator being German,

15:59.199 --> 16:01.633
but this would suggest an improved version.

16:01.668 --> 16:04.969
Innovations like this would
revolutionize the automobile.

16:05.004 --> 16:07.305
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Murdoch?

16:07.339 --> 16:10.075
Mr. Sampson was involved
in industrial espionage.

16:10.109 --> 16:13.605
Perhaps he was selling these innovations
to the mysterious bearded man.

16:14.318 --> 16:16.081
That would explain the
need for the coded message.

16:16.115 --> 16:19.584
But Mr. Sampson seemed
such an ordinary man.

16:19.618 --> 16:22.653
Criminals come in all
shapes and sizes, son.

16:22.688 --> 16:25.556
I don't understand, Constable.

16:25.591 --> 16:27.958
How can my husband's body be missing?

16:27.992 --> 16:30.961
I assure you Mrs. Richardson we'll get
to the bottom of the matter in no time.

16:30.995 --> 16:32.996
If you had a photograph of your husband

16:33.031 --> 16:35.333
- that I could borrow...
- Of course.

16:35.367 --> 16:38.301
Anything I can do to help find poor Andrew.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.383
He was a very clever man, you know,

16:40.418 --> 16:43.821
and keen to help Dr. Dempsey's research.

16:43.855 --> 16:47.490
The two men discussed the matter
at length on several occasions.

16:47.525 --> 16:51.261
A generous man also, I would
say. I mean, to give up his brain.

16:51.296 --> 16:53.396
I thought it was macabre,
to tell the truth,

16:53.431 --> 16:55.998
but it was none of my business.

16:56.033 --> 16:59.669
It was Andrew's to do with as he pleased.

16:59.704 --> 17:02.104
Still, to have it pickled in a jar...

17:02.139 --> 17:04.106
What do you mean, Constable?

17:04.141 --> 17:06.142
Nothing at all, Mrs. Richardson.

17:06.175 --> 17:08.176
If I could get that photograph...

17:08.212 --> 17:10.378
Of course...

17:14.984 --> 17:17.082
You're absolutely correct. There
are signsof petechial hemorrhage

17:17.085 --> 17:20.388
- in the victim's eyes.
- Are you sure?

17:20.423 --> 17:23.492
You did well to spot them. These tiny
markings can be difficult to identify.

17:23.526 --> 17:25.493
Well, a second set of eyes never hurts.

17:25.528 --> 17:26.970
- I was happy to help.
- We should let

17:26.980 --> 17:30.632
- the detective know right away.
- Actually, I may just wait

17:30.667 --> 17:32.168
till this evening to see William.

17:32.669 --> 17:33.279
Oh.

17:33.282 --> 17:37.252
You know, Julia, married life suits you.

17:37.286 --> 17:39.254
Really? Am I that different?

17:39.288 --> 17:42.723
There's a lightness in
you I haven't seen before.

17:42.758 --> 17:46.027
You seem... happier.

17:46.062 --> 17:49.230
I must say the romance of
the honeymoon continues.

17:49.265 --> 17:52.500
- Romance? The Detective?
- Yes.

17:52.535 --> 17:56.337
- We're quite enjoying ourselves.
- Oh, my!

17:58.441 --> 18:00.975
Cathode...

18:04.479 --> 18:06.781
Dr. Grace?

18:06.815 --> 18:10.117
Doctor, have you something for
me, or is this is a social visit?

18:10.151 --> 18:13.621
No. I mean, yes.

18:13.655 --> 18:15.789
I have a further report on Mr. Sampson.

18:15.823 --> 18:18.592
I now believe he died longer

18:18.626 --> 18:21.195
than 24 hours before his body was found.

18:21.229 --> 18:24.064
- I see.
- And after a more detailed examination,

18:24.099 --> 18:26.467
I can confirm he was indeed stabbed,

18:26.501 --> 18:28.802
but stabbed post-mortem.

18:28.836 --> 18:33.106
- Well, how did he die?
- Suffocation. Likely smothered.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.763
- Are you quite sure?
- I was astonished myself,

18:35.827 --> 18:37.724
but my curiosity was piqued when I saw

18:37.725 --> 18:40.012
possible signs of petechial
hemorrhaging in his eyes.

18:40.134 --> 18:42.802
I asked Dr. Ogden for a second opinion;

18:42.837 --> 18:44.838
she supported my conclusion.

18:44.872 --> 18:48.774
But if he was smothered
before he was stabbed,

18:48.808 --> 18:50.976
how did he write the
message in his own blood?

18:51.010 --> 18:55.748
Dr. Grace, your report throws new
light even as it cast more shadow.

18:55.782 --> 18:59.151
How eloquent, Detective. Quite a romantic

18:59.185 --> 19:02.087
- turn of phrase.
- I'm sorry?

19:02.122 --> 19:04.089
Nothing.

19:04.124 --> 19:07.292
- Sir. You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Henry. Please bring in Mr. Barnes.

19:07.626 --> 19:09.061
Sure.

19:11.064 --> 19:13.498
That one is the Tyrant Flycatcher.

19:13.532 --> 19:16.534
They superficially resemble
the Old World Flycatcher

19:16.569 --> 19:19.104
but are more robust
and have stronger bills.

19:19.139 --> 19:22.940
You're something of an
ornithologist, Mr. Barnes.

19:22.975 --> 19:25.510
The myriad birds in our
city are quite remarkable,

19:25.544 --> 19:28.012
something most citizens fail to notice.

19:37.222 --> 19:39.957
That's the man I saw, Detective.

19:39.992 --> 19:42.359
- Annie Cranston.
- Who?

19:44.529 --> 19:46.730
Thank you, Mr. Barnes.
You've been most helpful.

19:46.765 --> 19:49.066
I'm... most happy to oblige.

19:51.336 --> 19:53.637
- Hello, ladies.
- Clara!

19:53.672 --> 19:55.206
- Thank you for joining us.
- Thank you for bringing this

19:55.240 --> 19:56.708
matter to my attention, Julia.

19:57.142 --> 20:00.945
I must say, you have a talent
for unconventional thinking.

20:00.979 --> 20:03.081
Oh... Some would say it's my forte.

20:03.515 --> 20:05.083
So what do you think, Clara?

20:05.117 --> 20:08.485
Do the election rules
prevent a woman from running?

20:08.520 --> 20:10.487
Were a woman to be
elected, I'm sure the doors

20:10.522 --> 20:12.489
to Queen's Park would
be well and truly barred.

20:12.724 --> 20:14.592
However, I can find
nothing to say that someone

20:14.626 --> 20:17.494
of the female persuasion
cannot stand as a candidate.

20:17.529 --> 20:20.063
- Officially?
- Officially.

20:20.098 --> 20:22.799
Clara, that is fantastic.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.801
Now all we need is a candidate.

20:24.836 --> 20:28.638
- I nominate Julia.
- Why me? It could be anyone.

20:28.672 --> 20:31.174
You are the most accomplished.
You speak so well...

20:31.209 --> 20:33.243
And you are mightily persuasive.

20:33.327 --> 20:37.530
- I don't know about that...
- Plus it was your idea.

20:37.564 --> 20:40.167
- Well, in that case...
- Excellent.

20:40.201 --> 20:43.770
Then it's settled.

20:43.804 --> 20:46.272
This is a rather momentous occasion.

20:46.307 --> 20:48.274
I think we should be
drinking something stronger.

20:48.309 --> 20:51.243
Au contraire, it is quite perfect.

20:51.278 --> 20:54.781
The advancement of women marked
by the clink of china teacups.

21:03.290 --> 21:06.258
- Miss Cranston.
- Hello, Detective Murdoch.

21:06.293 --> 21:09.361
You know more about the man who stole
your book than you are letting on.

21:09.395 --> 21:13.265
- What do you mean?
- Who is he?

21:13.300 --> 21:15.667
His name is Maxwell. That's all I know.

21:15.702 --> 21:18.002
He said he worked for
Mr. Henry Ford, and that

21:18.037 --> 21:21.673
- we would both be rich if I would help him.
- What did he ask you to do?

21:21.708 --> 21:24.876
- I was to buy that book for him.
- Mark Twain's?

21:24.910 --> 21:28.613
Yes. And if anyone were to ask about
it, I was to say it had been stolen.

21:28.648 --> 21:31.750
- How did you two meet?
- He lives in my boarding house.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.142
Sir...

21:59.177 --> 22:01.144
What is it?

22:01.179 --> 22:03.881
The book, complete with the missing pages.

22:03.915 --> 22:07.417
- Maxwell is our man.
- We're too late, Murdoch.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.259
The landlady said he left for
New York City 12 hours ago.

22:10.260 --> 22:11.240
No forwarding address.

22:11.256 --> 22:13.223
- Unfortunate.
- We can send

22:13.258 --> 22:16.326
his photographs to the New York coppers.

22:16.361 --> 22:18.528
Oh, cheer up, Murdoch.

22:18.562 --> 22:20.663
It's not very often we let
a murderer slip our grasp.

22:20.698 --> 22:22.665
No, sir, that isn't it.

22:22.700 --> 22:26.603
This case... something seems odd.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.171
What do you mean?

22:29.206 --> 22:32.876
This Maxwell fellow. He looks familiar.

22:34.945 --> 22:38.448
George?

22:38.482 --> 22:41.350
Sir. I have a photograph
of my missing brain.

22:41.385 --> 22:44.387
Our two corpses appear to be the same man.

22:44.421 --> 22:48.057
- Something's fishy.
- It certainly is.

22:48.091 --> 22:50.526
Bring them in, George. All of them.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.030
Yes, sir. Who exactly?

22:59.067 --> 23:02.469
- Ruby! No.
- Ugh...

23:08.710 --> 23:11.946
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Detective.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.882
- Why are we here?
- I want to thank you.

23:14.917 --> 23:18.185
You have all been most
helpful in my investigation

23:18.219 --> 23:20.354
into the murder of Randolph Sampson.

23:20.388 --> 23:23.523
- We're glad we could help.
- However,

23:23.558 --> 23:25.525
I regret to inform you that I have

23:25.560 --> 23:27.727
failed to apprehend the murderer.

23:27.762 --> 23:30.664
- Why not, Detective?
- For one simple reason.

23:30.698 --> 23:34.067
Because the murderer does not exist.

23:34.101 --> 23:36.302
But I saw him. And he was
in the photograph that I...

23:36.337 --> 23:38.839
You could not have seen him, Mr. Barnes,

23:38.873 --> 23:40.974
because the man in the photograph was you.

23:41.008 --> 23:43.543
- But I...
- Please Mr. Barnes, you will

23:43.578 --> 23:46.045
have an opportunity to
speak when I'm finished.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.714
Not only did the murderer not exist,

23:48.748 --> 23:50.984
but neither did

23:51.018 --> 23:53.853
Randolph Sampson.

23:53.887 --> 23:57.656
The corpse belonged to none other
than Professor Andrew Richardson,

23:57.691 --> 24:01.427
whose cadaver was on its
way to scientific research

24:01.462 --> 24:04.763
when it mysteriously
disappeared two days ago.

24:04.878 --> 24:08.781
This has all been an elaborate ruse,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.951
in which you all played a part.

24:11.985 --> 24:15.187
- Very good, Detective.
- Please Mrs. Dewar.

24:15.221 --> 24:20.092
Mr. Hume, you reported the
fictitious Randolph Sampson missing.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.927
Mr. Sampson is my employer, sir.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.098
He is away on business.
I borrowed his office.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.534
And his good name. The torn
pages from the novel led me

24:29.569 --> 24:33.338
to your bookshop, Mrs. Dewar,
And you in turn led me to

24:33.372 --> 24:35.707
Ruby Rosevear and Annie Cranston,

24:35.741 --> 24:39.510
who furthered the myth of the Bearded Man.

24:39.544 --> 24:42.947
I was led to a series of
clues including Blue Sky,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.949
and the photograph which featured

24:44.984 --> 24:48.786
you, Miss Cranston, and
the mysterious Mr. Maxwell,

24:48.821 --> 24:51.022
which was in fact, you, Mr.
Barnes, with a false beard.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.024
It wasn't false.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.859
- I grew it especially for the part.
- Didn't I tell you?

24:55.893 --> 24:59.563
I knew he would figure it out. This...

24:59.598 --> 25:01.832
... has all been a game,

25:01.866 --> 25:06.069
and a colossal waste of the
Constabulary's valuable time.

25:06.104 --> 25:08.905
What were you hoping to achieve?

25:08.940 --> 25:11.808
We wanted to watch you as
you work, Detective Murdoch.

25:11.843 --> 25:16.146
Watch me work... why?

25:16.180 --> 25:18.481
To appreciate you.

25:18.516 --> 25:21.251
We are such admirers of
your detective skills.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.887
- And the rest.
- Ruby!

25:23.921 --> 25:26.189
We read about your
successes in the newspaper,

25:26.223 --> 25:28.958
and then we meet once a month
to discuss your clever ways.

25:28.992 --> 25:32.428
All your marvelous gadgets
and your analytical mind.

25:32.463 --> 25:35.498
I'm most surprised by you, Mrs. Dewar.

25:35.533 --> 25:39.569
- We meant no harm.
- But your actions were harmful.

25:39.603 --> 25:42.004
The corpse you stole

25:42.039 --> 25:45.340
was more than just a
plaything in your macabre game.

25:45.375 --> 25:48.711
- What do you mean?
- Professor Andrew Richardson

25:48.745 --> 25:53.282
did not die of natural causes.
He was in fact murdered.

25:53.316 --> 25:56.285
- Murdered?
- Yes.

25:56.319 --> 25:59.755
And thanks to your ridiculous
antics, the true killer may

25:59.790 --> 26:02.791
very likely have escaped justice.

26:06.755 --> 26:11.080
How uncanny. We staged a fictional mistery,

26:11.158 --> 26:15.528
and the corpse we borrow
is actually a murder victim.

26:15.563 --> 26:18.964
- How did you obtain Mr. Richardson's body?
- That was my doing.

26:18.998 --> 26:22.067
I was a medical student at one
time and knew the building well.

26:22.102 --> 26:25.971
When we conceived the notion of a murder
investigation, I agreed to procure the corpse.

26:26.005 --> 26:28.073
And the blood at the crime scene?

26:28.108 --> 26:31.776
Pig's blood, sir. My brother
works at a slaughterhouse.

26:31.811 --> 26:34.546
It was pretty convincing though, wasn't it?

26:34.581 --> 26:37.582
We devised roles in the
mystery around our real lives.

26:37.617 --> 26:41.720
You concocted a fanciful
amusement which I must now undo

26:41.754 --> 26:44.756
to investigate a real murder.

26:44.790 --> 26:47.659
- Perhaps we could be of assistance?
- No.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.061
Mrs. Dewar has a brilliant
mind and an excellent memory.

26:50.096 --> 26:52.664
- Perhaps she can help...
- You can help by staying out of my way.

26:52.798 --> 26:56.567
- I'm of a mind to charge the lot of you.
- What with?

26:56.602 --> 26:59.604
Desecration of a human
body. If you continue

26:59.638 --> 27:03.441
to interfere in this investigation,
you will all wind up behind bars.

27:03.475 --> 27:06.794
Is that understood?

27:06.798 --> 27:08.933
I'm very sorry, Dr. Dempsey. As soon as

27:08.967 --> 27:11.168
our investigation is complete,
Professor Richardson's body

27:11.202 --> 27:13.236
will be transported back
to the School of Medicine.

27:13.271 --> 27:16.040
There's no need. The brain
has already deteriorated.

27:16.074 --> 27:19.242
My research remains unproven and
my funding soon will be cut off.

27:19.277 --> 27:21.344
Who's responsible for stealing the cadaver?

27:21.379 --> 27:25.014
- A former medical student by the name of Nigel Barnes.
- That ass?

27:25.049 --> 27:27.184
He was expelled for hijinks at the school.

27:27.218 --> 27:29.186
I cannot believe he would
ruin my important research

27:29.220 --> 27:31.221
for another ridiculous lark.

27:43.567 --> 27:46.535
Their actions are mystifying, Julia.

27:46.570 --> 27:50.073
Why break the law simply to watch me work?

27:50.107 --> 27:54.777
They read about you, they meet to
discuss your work. They're your fans.

27:54.812 --> 27:58.314
The Detective Murdoch
Appreciation Society, as it were.

28:01.451 --> 28:04.487
- But I'm simply doing my job.
- Thank you.

28:04.521 --> 28:08.491
Shall we?

28:08.525 --> 28:13.095
Why follow the activities
of a person you don't know?

28:13.130 --> 28:16.498
I suspect they feel that they do know you.

28:16.532 --> 28:20.235
Perhaps they want to feel part of
something greater than themselves.

28:20.269 --> 28:23.138
But they seem to have perfectly good lives.

28:23.172 --> 28:26.708
Everyone needs a hero, William.

28:28.477 --> 28:31.779
Mmm!

28:31.813 --> 28:35.016
Julia, this soup is cold.

28:35.050 --> 28:38.553
- It's supposed to be.
- Oh!

28:41.923 --> 28:46.194
William... I agreed to
do something rather bold.

28:46.228 --> 28:50.330
Well, that would make a change. What is it?

28:50.365 --> 28:53.333
How would you feel about my
running for Provincial Parliament?

28:53.368 --> 28:55.936
As a candidate?

28:55.971 --> 28:58.539
You wouldn't even be
able to vote for yourself.

28:58.573 --> 29:01.642
Then you would have to vote for me.

29:01.677 --> 29:05.479
It's highly unorthodox. It
certainly would garner a platform.

29:05.513 --> 29:08.682
- Exactly.
- You'd be in the public eye.

29:08.716 --> 29:12.919
- Do you mind?
- You may even wind up

29:12.953 --> 29:15.922
with a few fans of your own.

29:18.259 --> 29:20.526
How do we wade through the
mess that those idiots created

29:20.561 --> 29:22.796
and sort out who murdered
Andrew Richardson?

29:22.830 --> 29:25.098
Well, sir, we go back to the beginning.

29:25.132 --> 29:27.233
Doctor Grace ascertained
that Richardson had been

29:27.267 --> 29:29.669
- smothered to death.
- Right. Smothered, not stabbed.

29:29.704 --> 29:33.707
Right. George's investigation
provided vital background.

29:33.741 --> 29:35.709
Richardson had been sick for several weeks

29:35.743 --> 29:38.043
prior to his death 4 days ago.

29:38.078 --> 29:40.179
So, who had opportunity?
Who visited the man?

29:40.214 --> 29:43.082
Exactly, George. Who saw the victim last?

29:43.116 --> 29:45.250
This is too much, Detective.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.953
I'm reeling from my husband's death,

29:47.987 --> 29:50.522
when I learn his corpse has vanished.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.524
Now you tell me he was murdered.

29:52.558 --> 29:56.661
I'm terribly sorry to
upset you, Mrs. Richardson.

29:56.696 --> 29:59.497
When did you discover
your husband deceased?

29:59.532 --> 30:01.600
Four days ago. I thought he had passed

30:01.634 --> 30:04.102
mercifully in his sleep.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.904
Was anyone with him the previous night?

30:06.939 --> 30:08.906
My sister Hattie

30:08.941 --> 30:11.710
came by every evening. It
was something of a ritual.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.346
She would bring over chamomile tea

30:14.380 --> 30:17.514
and she and my husband would
discuss matters of philosophy.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.451
- You didn't visit with them?
- I preferred to take

30:20.485 --> 30:22.553
a sleeping draught and go to bed.

30:22.587 --> 30:26.323
Did anyone else see the Professor

30:26.358 --> 30:29.293
- the night before he passed?
- Why do you need to know all this?

30:29.428 --> 30:32.429
I already answered the
other detective's questions.

30:33.564 --> 30:36.133
What other detective?

30:36.167 --> 30:40.103
Mr. Hume, you are under arrest
for impersonating a police officer.

30:40.138 --> 30:44.408
I was just trying to help.

30:44.442 --> 30:48.611
Sir. Dr. Grace telephoned.
You're needed at the morgue.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.847
Thank you, George.

30:57.421 --> 30:59.455
Dr. Grace, what have you?

30:59.490 --> 31:01.892
I won't beat about the bush, Detective.

31:01.926 --> 31:03.894
Not only was Mr. Richardson
smothered and stabbed,

31:03.928 --> 31:05.895
he was being poisoned.

31:05.929 --> 31:09.098
- Poisoned?
- I found traces of arsenic in his kidneys.

31:09.132 --> 31:11.267
Smothered, stabbed and poisoned!

31:11.302 --> 31:13.636
It is certainly a doozie one.

31:13.671 --> 31:16.272
Oh! An expression of my father's.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.274
He's something of a colourful character.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.777
I see. Have you a record

31:20.811 --> 31:22.778
of Mr. Richardson's stomach contents?

31:22.813 --> 31:26.849
Pork chop, suet pudding
and traces of chamomile.

31:26.883 --> 31:29.451
- Likely from a tea.
- Chamomile tea...

31:31.454 --> 31:33.622
So this is the sister's house.

31:33.656 --> 31:35.791
Yes, according to Mrs.
Richardson, Hattie Baker

31:35.826 --> 31:38.327
would bring over chamomile
tea every evening.

31:38.361 --> 31:41.863
Hattie Baker?

31:41.897 --> 31:44.533
Toronto Constabulary. Open up.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.535
Remember George, we
are looking for evidence

31:46.569 --> 31:49.037
of poisoning.

31:59.514 --> 32:04.118
Sir, poison like this?

32:04.153 --> 32:06.687
Yes, George.

32:06.722 --> 32:09.523
It would appear Hattie Baker is our killer.

32:09.558 --> 32:11.859
- Very good, George.
- Detective!

32:11.893 --> 32:13.326
Detective! Stop!

32:13.327 --> 32:15.340
What are you doing here?
You were told to stay away.

32:15.664 --> 32:17.832
Hattie Baker is not your murderer.

32:17.866 --> 32:19.834
Oh, and what brought
you to that conclusion?

32:19.868 --> 32:22.002
The victim's wife planted the
arsenic in her sister's house.

32:22.036 --> 32:24.772
- Yes, and we can prove it.
- We have photographs!

32:28.977 --> 32:31.644
But we helped you catch the real murderer!

32:41.022 --> 32:43.357
You were poisoning your husband.

32:43.391 --> 32:46.292
Why?

32:48.696 --> 32:52.265
He never stopped going on
about my lack of brains.

32:52.299 --> 32:54.233
How Hattie was his intellectual equal.

32:54.268 --> 32:58.405
I couldn't shine a light to her or him.

32:58.439 --> 33:00.739
I may not be that clever, Detective,

33:00.774 --> 33:03.742
but I still have feelings.
That counts for something.

33:03.777 --> 33:07.546
When Andrew boasted that doctor

33:07.580 --> 33:10.682
wanted his "superior brain" for science,

33:10.717 --> 33:12.919
I saw my chance.

33:12.953 --> 33:16.088
You began to poison him.

33:16.123 --> 33:18.189
In his suet pudding.

33:18.224 --> 33:21.326
Believing the true cause
of death would go undetected

33:21.360 --> 33:23.395
when his body was brought
to the medical school.

33:23.430 --> 33:27.232
That Dr. Dempsey was so
keen to get at his brain

33:27.266 --> 33:29.267
I knew he wouldn't look at anything else.

33:29.302 --> 33:33.338
But why frame your sister, Hattie?

33:33.372 --> 33:35.941
She thought she was so smart.

33:35.975 --> 33:38.209
Let her use her brilliant mind

33:38.244 --> 33:40.979
to wriggle out of a murder charge.

33:41.013 --> 33:45.317
But the poison wasn't
working quickly enough,

33:45.351 --> 33:47.618
so you smothered your husband?

33:47.653 --> 33:49.987
Smother? I didn't smother him!

34:00.809 --> 34:02.307
We know who stabbed Richardson,

34:02.411 --> 34:05.113
we know who poisoned him but who
the bloody hell smothered him?

34:05.147 --> 34:09.283
Maybe it was a mercy killer putting
the poor bugger out of his misery.

34:09.317 --> 34:11.752
Perhaps the housekeeper
that was looking after him.

34:11.786 --> 34:14.454
Or Hattie Baker, for that matter.
You spoke to both of them, George.

34:14.688 --> 34:15.956
Yes, sir, they both swear

34:15.989 --> 34:18.091
up and down that Mr. Richardson
was still alive when they left

34:18.126 --> 34:20.393
the house together.
Sound asleep, but alive.

34:20.428 --> 34:22.395
So they did it together,

34:22.429 --> 34:24.737
or someone else was in
the house that night.

34:25.033 --> 34:28.467
Sirs, when I was in Unionville
questioning the women in... question,

34:28.502 --> 34:30.469
I took the liberty of having a look around.

34:30.504 --> 34:32.806
I found a set of footprints
near the side of the house,

34:32.840 --> 34:34.908
and in the shed there
was a ladder with some

34:34.942 --> 34:36.909
fresh mud on it. I mean,
I wonder if somebody could

34:36.944 --> 34:39.179
have just climbed up
into Mr. Richardson's room

34:39.213 --> 34:41.947
- in the dead of the night.
- Very good, George.

34:41.982 --> 34:44.617
Mrs. Richardson had
taken a sleeping draught.

34:44.652 --> 34:46.652
She wouldn't have heard an intruder.

34:46.687 --> 34:49.556
But who had motive to kill Mr. Richardson?

34:49.590 --> 34:52.824
What about that Dr.
Dempsey from the University?

34:52.859 --> 34:55.327
What if he killed Richardson
to obtain his brain before

34:55.360 --> 34:57.863
-his research money disappeared?
- According to the widow,

34:57.898 --> 35:00.632
Dempsey had spent some time at
the house with Mr. Richardson.

35:00.667 --> 35:04.044
- He'd have known the place.
- So he had motive and opportunity.

35:04.045 --> 35:05.025
Impressive plan.

35:05.038 --> 35:07.206
Smother Richardson in his sleep,

35:07.240 --> 35:09.208
then get the body delivered to your door.

35:09.242 --> 35:12.077
Any evidence would have ended
up in the university incinerator

35:12.111 --> 35:14.379
when the cadaver was disposed of.

35:14.414 --> 35:16.715
That's the hallmark of a perfect murder.

35:16.749 --> 35:19.050
Studying intelligence

35:19.085 --> 35:22.321
by examining the brains of intellectuals.

35:22.355 --> 35:25.357
I imagine finding suitable
subjects wouldn't be that easy.

35:25.391 --> 35:28.093
Sadly true. The superstitious belief

35:28.127 --> 35:32.296
that the body retains some sort
of soul after death still prevails,

35:32.331 --> 35:36.201
even among the high-minded.
Utter nonsense, of course.

35:36.235 --> 35:40.171
But you're not here to
discuss metaphysics, Detective.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.173
I understand Professor Richardson

35:42.208 --> 35:44.209
was a coveted specimen.

35:44.243 --> 35:47.144
And that you were under
pressure to prove your hypothesis

35:47.178 --> 35:49.380
before you lost financial backing.

35:49.414 --> 35:51.582
- I was.
- Well, how convenient, then,

35:51.617 --> 35:55.319
that Professor Richardson's body
wound up on your dissecting table

35:55.354 --> 35:57.821
just before that funding dried up.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.691
Where were you the night that
Professor Richardson died, Doctor?

36:01.726 --> 36:04.762
- What you are suggesting?
- The Professor was murdered.

36:04.852 --> 36:06.986
You knew he'd been ailing
for some time, you simply

36:07.021 --> 36:11.825
- helped the process along.
- That is absolutely ridiculous!

36:11.859 --> 36:15.461
- The circumstances are very compelling, Dr. Dempsey.
- Get out of my lab, Detective.

36:15.495 --> 36:18.798
- I have important work to do.
- Really?

36:18.832 --> 36:21.567
I understood that you lost your
financial backing along with

36:21.601 --> 36:23.569
the Professor's brain.

36:23.653 --> 36:26.389
Not that it is any concern of
yours, but I have another donor,

36:26.423 --> 36:28.657
of equal intelligence
and at an advanced age.

36:28.692 --> 36:30.793
The papers will be signed this afternoon.

36:30.827 --> 36:33.362
- But your funding...
- It will not be long

36:33.397 --> 36:35.364
before my research is again underway.

36:35.398 --> 36:40.368
Good day to you, Detective.

36:40.403 --> 36:43.204
- So you think he's our man?
- Yes, but to prove it...

36:43.238 --> 36:45.440
He's Mr. Clever Clogs, all right.

36:45.575 --> 36:46.526
George and I will go back up to Unionville,

36:46.527 --> 36:48.527
see if there's anything
we might have missed.

36:48.677 --> 36:51.679
- Worth a try. What else?
- Well, we've wrung all we can

36:51.714 --> 36:54.582
- out of the Professor's body.
- Any evidence is long gone anyway,

36:54.617 --> 36:57.285
thanks to the boneheads
still in my jail cell.

36:57.319 --> 37:00.554
- What should we to do with them?
- Sir, I would love to charge them all, but...

37:00.588 --> 37:04.091
We wouldn't have a clue about
this murder without them.

37:04.126 --> 37:06.460
Aye-aye. Speak of the devil.

37:12.934 --> 37:15.235
- Mr. Barnes. How can I help?
- It's Mrs. Dewar.

37:15.269 --> 37:17.270
I think she's put herself in harm's way.

37:17.305 --> 37:20.541
Oh, well... right this way.

37:20.575 --> 37:22.676
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

37:27.048 --> 37:29.015
What about Mrs. Dewar?

37:29.050 --> 37:30.850
We were having tea at the bookshop,

37:30.884 --> 37:32.919
discussing Mr. Richardson's
murder, when we hit upon a

37:32.954 --> 37:36.522
- bizarre though plausible theory.
- Which was?

37:36.557 --> 37:39.692
Dr. Dempsey, the brain
researcher, might be the killer.

37:39.726 --> 37:42.329
I talked with friends at
the school and it turns out

37:42.363 --> 37:44.797
that Dr. Dempsey was
under terrible pressure

37:44.832 --> 37:47.299
to prove his neuron thesis.
He needed a brain tout de suite

37:47.334 --> 37:51.637
so I thought perhaps he took
matters into his own hands.

37:51.672 --> 37:54.607
Mr. Barnes, what does this
have to do with Mrs. Dewar?

37:54.641 --> 37:57.076
She has come up with a
plan to entrap the Doctor.

37:57.110 --> 38:00.212
- She donated her brain.
- Yes.

38:00.246 --> 38:02.747
The puzzle that Dr. Dempsey
placed in the newspaper...

38:02.782 --> 38:05.617
she had already completed it,
so she took it to the Doctor.

38:05.651 --> 38:08.220
He of course wanted her
brain and she said yes.

38:08.254 --> 38:11.723
You were going to lure Dr. Dempsey
into trying to kill Mrs. Dewar?

38:11.757 --> 38:14.626
Exactly. Catch him
red-handed, so to speak.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.661
But I started to have second thoughts.

38:16.696 --> 38:18.897
I tried talking her out of
it but she wouldn't listen.

38:18.931 --> 38:21.165
- That's why I came here.
- George.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.401
Sir?

38:23.435 --> 38:25.403
Telephone the Faculty of Medicine.

38:25.437 --> 38:29.173
I need to speak with Dr.
Dempsey urgently. Sir.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.710
Mr. Barnes, I believe Mrs. Dewar

38:31.744 --> 38:34.012
is due to sign the donor papers today.

38:34.046 --> 38:36.114
I tried to dissuade her.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.849
Really, I did. I told her it was too risky,

38:38.884 --> 38:41.185
- but she wouldn't hear it.
- Why not?

38:41.220 --> 38:45.523
Catching the real killer was to
be her apology to you, Detective.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.658
For interfering the way that we did.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.660
Oh, lord.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.396
Sir.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.765
Dempsey left the School
of Medicine 15 minutes ago.

38:54.799 --> 38:57.300
We must leave at once.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.275
That's Dr. Dempsey's carriage.

39:05.309 --> 39:07.277
Please hurry, Detective.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.579
He might already be smothering Mrs. Dewar.

39:13.884 --> 39:16.886
Doctor, step aside.

39:16.921 --> 39:19.156
How dare you? I am examining my patient!

39:19.190 --> 39:21.391
- Are you all right, Mrs. Dewar?
- Well, I am,

39:21.426 --> 39:24.194
- now that you and the Detective are here.
- What on earth?

39:24.228 --> 39:26.629
Well, well. The murder weapon.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.631
That is not mine.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.633
Nigel Barnes,

39:30.668 --> 39:33.703
you are under arrest for the
murder of Andrew Richardson.

39:33.737 --> 39:35.838
My goodness!

39:35.873 --> 39:38.374
What are you doing?
Dempsey is your murderer!

39:38.408 --> 39:43.745
So you've led me to believe. But
you were the killer, Mr. Barnes.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.914
Why would you think that?

39:46.019 --> 39:48.621
On the way here you were
concerned that Dr. Dempsey

39:48.655 --> 39:51.123
was going to smother Mrs. Dewar.

39:51.158 --> 39:53.692
- So?
- There's only one way

39:53.726 --> 39:56.728
you could have known how
Professor Richardson was killed.

39:56.763 --> 39:59.330
You did the smothering.

40:01.534 --> 40:03.835
You told us how he died, Detective.

40:03.870 --> 40:05.827
You told the whole group.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Dewar?

40:05.828 --> 40:08.295
As I recall, Detective Murdoch

40:08.300 --> 40:10.776
told us that Professor
Richardson was murdered,

40:10.810 --> 40:12.978
but not how he was murdered.

40:13.012 --> 40:16.113
You were upset at the
time. You've forgotten.

40:16.148 --> 40:19.984
I don't think so, dear. You've said so
yourself, I have an excellent memory.

40:20.018 --> 40:23.821
- This is absurd.
- Honestly, Mr. Barnes.

40:23.891 --> 40:26.460
Do you really think you could outwit

40:26.494 --> 40:28.562
the great Detective Murdoch?

40:28.597 --> 40:30.731
Ahem...

40:30.765 --> 40:33.233
Take him way, George.

40:36.237 --> 40:39.973
So, Mrs. Dewar, about your brain...

40:40.007 --> 40:42.175
even with this unpleasant incident,

40:42.210 --> 40:44.510
I trust our agreement still stands.

40:44.545 --> 40:46.847
After your death, of course.

40:46.881 --> 40:48.848
I don't see why not.

40:48.882 --> 40:52.252
Thank you. And Detective,

40:52.286 --> 40:55.722
you'd be an excellent
candidate for my study.

40:55.756 --> 40:58.391
When the time comes, of course.

41:04.065 --> 41:05.217
So, Doctor,

41:05.218 --> 41:06.698
what do you make of the
detective's admirers?

41:07.204 --> 41:09.873
It seems the notion of ardent followers

41:09.908 --> 41:12.242
is something ofof a modern phenomenon.

41:12.276 --> 41:14.411
A by-product of his successes, I suppose.

41:14.446 --> 41:16.580
The whole idea is rather fascinating,

41:16.614 --> 41:19.349
psychologically speaking.

41:19.383 --> 41:22.885
A bunch of happy dafties, if you ask me.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.422
I cannot believe Mr. Barnes did it.

41:25.456 --> 41:28.358
Why would he kill Professor
Richardson? He didn't know him.

41:28.392 --> 41:30.927
The poor Professor was an
innocent victim in all of this.

41:30.962 --> 41:33.330
The intended target was Dr. Dempsey.

41:33.364 --> 41:37.000
- But why?
- Simple revenge.

41:37.034 --> 41:39.234
Dr. Dempsey was the teacher
that expelled Mr. Barnes

41:39.269 --> 41:41.236
from the Faculty of Medicine.

41:41.271 --> 41:43.606
Once he learned about your

41:43.640 --> 41:47.443
murder idea, he set his plan into action.

41:47.478 --> 41:50.012
But why not just kill the
Professor and frame Dr. Dempsey?

41:50.046 --> 41:52.515
Why complicate things the pretend murder?

41:52.549 --> 41:56.118
- Well, that's the clever part.
- Clever how?

41:56.152 --> 41:58.387
In order to frame Dr. Dempsey,

41:58.421 --> 42:00.856
Mr. Barnes had to devise a perfect murder,

42:00.890 --> 42:03.258
one that only Dr. Dempsey could commit.

42:03.293 --> 42:06.528
He knew that I would see
through the masquerade

42:06.562 --> 42:08.730
and find the true identity of the victim.

42:08.764 --> 42:11.600
He also knew that we would
find the true cause of death,

42:11.634 --> 42:14.536
the smothering. So he had you, Mrs. Dewar,

42:14.570 --> 42:17.806
lure Dr. Dempsey to your bookshop.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.441
He sowed the seeds of suspicion,

42:20.476 --> 42:23.378
and made sure that I arrived
at just the right time.

42:23.412 --> 42:26.114
And the chloral hydrate
in the Doctor's bag?

42:26.148 --> 42:29.050
A final piece of evidence he planted.

42:29.084 --> 42:31.419
But our friend Mr. Barnes
was a little too eager.

42:31.453 --> 42:34.288
One slip of the tongue and
our Detective caught him out.

42:34.323 --> 42:37.091
Oh... Congratulations, Detective!

42:44.933 --> 42:48.301
May I have your autograph, Detective?

42:48.336 --> 42:50.938
All right, Miss Cranston.

42:50.972 --> 42:53.741
Oh, well... how about
a photograph, Detective?

42:53.775 --> 42:55.809
... Certainly.

42:55.844 --> 42:58.145
Why not? Henry!

43:00.614 --> 43:02.516
Could you please take a photograph of us?

43:02.550 --> 43:04.918
- Of course, sir.
- Miss Cranston,

43:04.952 --> 43:08.355
Mrs. Dewar, Mr. Hume...

43:08.389 --> 43:10.657
You too, Ruby.

43:10.691 --> 43:12.659
You're a good sport, Detective.

43:12.693 --> 43:16.896
- All in day's work.
- All right, everybody smile.
