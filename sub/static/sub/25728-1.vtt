01:27.861 --> 01:29.330
Early?

01:31.965 --> 01:33.468
Early?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.100
Yeah?

01:36.102 --> 01:39.306
Mr. Mandam's here
from the funeral home.

01:43.509 --> 01:44.742
Early?

01:44.744 --> 01:45.846
Okay.

01:48.015 --> 01:49.915
Do you need some help?

01:49.917 --> 01:51.782
No, I don't need any help.

01:51.784 --> 01:53.287
Are you sure?

02:16.009 --> 02:17.845
<i>Well, that will happen.</i>

02:19.011 --> 02:20.579
I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:20.581 --> 02:21.847
Yes, sir.

02:21.849 --> 02:24.449
Can I have
Mr. Landry call you?

02:24.451 --> 02:26.521
Very good.
You have a wonderful day.

02:28.488 --> 02:30.021
He's checking his policy.

02:30.023 --> 02:31.823
Dorothy's starting to
lose her mind. He says.

02:31.825 --> 02:34.126
But hasn't he already
lost his?

02:34.128 --> 02:36.160
I'm just saying.

02:36.162 --> 02:37.962
Are you okay?

02:37.964 --> 02:39.733
Fine.

02:40.968 --> 02:43.435
Can I get you anything?

02:43.437 --> 02:45.003
Not that I can think of.

02:46.939 --> 02:49.174
Landry's Insurance.
This is Diane.

02:49.176 --> 02:50.474
Uh-huh.

02:50.476 --> 02:52.978
Mm-hmm.
I... yeah, hold on.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.781
It's Mr. Hatton.

02:58.118 --> 03:02.187
No, Mr. Landry's not in.
I expect him after lunch.

03:02.189 --> 03:05.459
I think he's doing about
as well as can be expected.

03:06.527 --> 03:07.959
It was tragic, yes, sir.

03:07.961 --> 03:09.728
How's Mrs. Hatton doing?

05:45.085 --> 05:47.586
<i>Ms. Sachman?</i>

05:47.588 --> 05:50.857
<i>Dr. Agee from Crane,
Mississippi on line one.</i>

06:02.102 --> 06:04.903
I thought you were dead.

06:04.905 --> 06:07.241
- Almost.
- Not funny.

06:08.841 --> 06:11.845
- Sort of.
- No, not even a little.

06:16.148 --> 06:19.317
I should have come sooner.
I'm sorry.

06:19.319 --> 06:21.853
You came when you could. It
wouldn't have made any difference

06:21.855 --> 06:23.958
when you came.
Honestly.

06:40.006 --> 06:44.309
Uh, I drove by
Mama and Daddy's today.

06:44.311 --> 06:48.112
Those fucking people
let it go.

06:48.114 --> 06:51.682
- Yeah, they have.
- So trashy. It's sad.

06:51.684 --> 06:53.151
It is.

06:53.153 --> 06:57.756
So,
we got two options here.

06:57.758 --> 07:01.893
Dr. Agee said you can

07:01.895 --> 07:04.228
go to the mental health
facility in Tupelo,

07:04.230 --> 07:07.331
which is not an option
at all, really.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.434
Or he releases you
to my care

07:09.436 --> 07:12.039
and I take you to L.A.

07:14.675 --> 07:17.709
Tupelo or L.A.

07:17.711 --> 07:19.310
I've got plenty of room.

07:19.312 --> 07:21.713
And, you see, it's really
not a choice, Early,

07:21.715 --> 07:24.852
because I'm not letting them
put you in that place.

07:26.086 --> 07:28.452
Well...

07:28.454 --> 07:31.324
I guess it's settled then.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.766
No, he has to be there.

07:41.768 --> 07:44.334
What part of "He has to be
there, I'm not asking"

07:44.336 --> 07:47.137
don't you understand?

07:47.139 --> 07:49.040
Because I don't have
a third act,

07:49.042 --> 07:52.009
and if I don't have a third act,
I don't have a movie.

07:52.011 --> 07:55.480
Well, try and schedule Jeffrey
for 1:00, the Germans for 2:30,

07:55.482 --> 07:59.951
and I'm not asking.
Thank you.

07:59.953 --> 08:02.420
- Put the phone down!
- Now!

08:02.422 --> 08:05.355
Hey, Uncle Early! You want to come
see my basketball game today?

08:05.357 --> 08:07.158
No, he doesn't.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.259
- Morning, Early.
- Morning.

08:09.261 --> 08:11.096
There's coffee and bagels.

08:11.098 --> 08:13.430
Uh, thank you.

08:13.432 --> 08:15.201
Oh.

08:16.737 --> 08:18.202
Sleep well?

08:18.204 --> 08:20.504
Like the dead.

08:20.506 --> 08:22.406
Please, stop texting.

08:22.408 --> 08:26.043
Uh...
I have to go into the office

08:26.045 --> 08:27.478
- this morning for a little bit.
- Yeah, me too.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.413
So, you'll be alone
until till noonish.

08:29.415 --> 08:32.049
- I can stay home if you want.
- You have a trig test

08:32.052 --> 08:34.018
- that you have to do very well on, young man.
- Very well.

08:34.020 --> 08:37.388
You know, I've gotten one B
in my entire academic career.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.325
You set the expectations
too high too early.

08:40.327 --> 08:42.860
So noon.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.996
And then we'll have lunch?

08:45.998 --> 08:48.999
- Are you going to be okay?
- Of course.

08:49.001 --> 08:51.939
You call me if you need me?

08:55.976 --> 09:01.346
- He's going to be late.
- Get your stuff together.

09:01.348 --> 09:05.082
- Do you have my number?
- Yes.

09:05.084 --> 09:09.256
- See you later, Uncle Early.
- Yes, you will.

09:13.425 --> 09:15.161
I'll see you, Earl.

09:16.295 --> 09:18.498
Ted.

10:13.553 --> 10:15.419
I am in the middle
of the red carpet,

10:15.421 --> 10:18.121
not quite sure what
I should be doing,

10:18.123 --> 10:21.225
and Rita was off posing
for the photographers,

10:21.227 --> 10:22.594
and Meryl comes up to me.

10:22.596 --> 10:26.096
She is shaking my hand
and I look up,

10:26.098 --> 10:30.400
and in the crowd, watching this
spectacle, is Laura Donato.

10:30.402 --> 10:32.302
The girl he took
to his high school prom.

10:32.304 --> 10:34.272
Mm-hmm.
And she's waving at me.

10:34.274 --> 10:36.640
Yeah, and he goes up to
her and he starts reminiscing

10:36.642 --> 10:39.076
with this woman
for a good five minutes.

10:39.078 --> 10:42.647
It was a couple of minutes. I
hadn't seen her since that summer.

10:42.649 --> 10:44.448
- How'd she look?
- Heavy.

10:44.450 --> 10:46.985
A little bit. A little bit.

10:46.987 --> 10:48.919
So, here we are
at the Oscars...

10:48.921 --> 10:51.992
Laurette told me that
your wife died.

10:56.262 --> 10:59.464
Uh, that's right.
She did. Yeah.

10:59.466 --> 11:01.365
So did my husband.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.970
Stomach cancer.

11:05.338 --> 11:07.408
I'm sorry.

11:10.242 --> 11:13.076
Uh...
car wreck.

11:13.078 --> 11:17.215
Julia just opened a...

11:17.217 --> 11:19.517
a little boutique
clothing store.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.052
And it got a blurb in Vogue.

11:21.054 --> 11:22.452
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah!

11:22.454 --> 11:25.523
- Really nice stuff.
- Well, that's great.

11:25.525 --> 11:28.659
It's wonderful stuff.

11:28.661 --> 11:30.528
Why is Jack so quiet?

11:30.530 --> 11:33.030
- He and Brittany are studying.
- Oh!

11:33.032 --> 11:35.432
At first I didn't love him.

11:35.434 --> 11:37.402
He was 25 years older than me,

11:37.404 --> 11:39.303
and I liked him
because he wasn't stupid.

11:39.305 --> 11:41.940
Well, do you think
they're really studying?

11:41.942 --> 11:44.308
That's the story and
I'm sticking to it.

11:46.413 --> 11:49.113
And then when he got sick,
I remember thinking,

11:49.115 --> 11:51.982
"That's what you get
for marrying an old guy."

11:51.984 --> 11:54.284
Were you and your wife
the same age?

11:54.286 --> 11:56.486
They grew up
next door to each other.

11:56.488 --> 11:58.389
That is amazing.
Wha...

11:58.391 --> 12:02.626
- You know, I really like your accent.
- Thank you.

12:02.628 --> 12:05.364
One day, I was shocked
to realize that I did love him.

12:09.435 --> 12:12.038
I didn't want to
have sex with him.

12:13.707 --> 12:17.307
But I loved him.

12:17.309 --> 12:22.482
And I don't seem to be able
to stop thinking about him.

12:39.699 --> 12:41.501
Excuse me.

14:01.814 --> 14:04.347
Hi.

14:04.349 --> 14:05.618
Hi.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.687
No shoes?

14:10.689 --> 14:12.789
Uh, I left them outside.
They're full of sand.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.759
- Good call.
- You went to the beach?

14:15.761 --> 14:17.595
Uh...

14:17.597 --> 14:19.665
Yep.

14:21.568 --> 14:23.537
It's 2:00 in the morning.

14:24.771 --> 14:25.802
Too late?

14:25.804 --> 14:27.205
- Yeah.
- No.

14:27.207 --> 14:28.472
Well, I was worried.

14:28.474 --> 14:30.273
That probably
makes me crazy

14:30.275 --> 14:33.845
- or, uh, controlling, right?
- I should have called.

14:33.847 --> 14:36.514
- No. Not at all. No, no.
- I think I should have.

14:36.516 --> 14:38.519
Yeah. You should have.

14:40.319 --> 14:41.885
I went swimming.

14:41.887 --> 14:44.221
Naked?

14:44.223 --> 14:46.724
Well... yeah. I guess.

14:46.726 --> 14:49.559
I hope that visual
isn't unnerving for you, Ted.

14:49.561 --> 14:51.328
Not at all.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.264
I'm going to bed.

14:53.266 --> 14:54.865
Goodnight, Laurette.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.301
Nudity is not allowed
on the beaches around here.

14:57.303 --> 14:59.570
Well, I figured. That's why that it was
a good thing there was no one around.

14:59.572 --> 15:01.475
Right. Good night.

16:35.234 --> 16:36.767
Fresh paint.

16:36.769 --> 16:38.635
Hardwood floors.

16:38.637 --> 16:41.404
Quiet building.

16:41.406 --> 16:44.243
$1400, plus utilities.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.348
I'll take it.

16:53.752 --> 16:56.689
Uh, mm...

16:59.458 --> 17:01.692
- Hey. Hi.
- Hello.

17:01.694 --> 17:05.199
Hey, you want to go to
Jack's basketball game tonight?

17:05.932 --> 17:07.832
Sure, sure, sure.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.871
Hey, your insurance
company sold. $750,000.00

17:15.008 --> 17:17.008
It's more than you thought.
Right?

17:17.010 --> 17:19.746
Oh, that's a good price.
Thanks for taking care of it.

17:21.914 --> 17:25.617
- Listen...
- Should I put the house on the market?

17:29.722 --> 17:31.425
Okay.

17:32.791 --> 17:34.357
I can...
I can take care of that.

17:34.359 --> 17:36.530
I'll take care of it.
I'll do it.

17:37.463 --> 17:38.965
Thank you.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.866
By the way, I found a place.

17:42.868 --> 17:44.902
- What?
- That's great. Where?

17:44.904 --> 17:46.537
In Hollywood. I have a balcony.

17:46.539 --> 17:50.407
Ah... You don't want
to live in Hollywood.

17:50.409 --> 17:52.076
- I think I do.
- You might think you do

17:52.078 --> 17:53.711
but you don't understand
Hollywood.

17:53.713 --> 17:55.746
- It's not that bad.
- Ted.

17:55.748 --> 17:59.049
Ted, no, he has enough money
to live anywhere.

17:59.051 --> 18:00.817
Hollywood's not for you.

18:00.819 --> 18:03.688
- I think it is.
- Well, you...

18:03.690 --> 18:05.355
Why?

18:05.357 --> 18:07.991
Why not Brentwood?
Why not West Hollywood?

18:07.993 --> 18:09.894
Be... be... because...

18:09.896 --> 18:12.730
Hollywood...

18:12.732 --> 18:16.936
is just far enough from you. And I
mean that in the most loving way.

18:17.936 --> 18:19.436
Is that fair?

18:19.438 --> 18:21.439
No. But it's true.

18:21.441 --> 18:23.840
Thanks.

18:23.842 --> 18:25.409
You know what I mean.

18:25.411 --> 18:26.676
No, I don't.

18:26.678 --> 18:29.012
Because there's
too much crime.

18:29.014 --> 18:32.450
It's aesthetically
very unpleasing!

18:32.452 --> 18:34.887
I will be alright.

18:37.889 --> 18:39.693
I'm scared.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.504
I organized your toiletries.

18:52.371 --> 18:53.770
Thanks.

18:53.772 --> 18:56.539
And the cleaning stuff
is under the sink.

18:56.541 --> 18:58.576
And he's cute, right?

18:58.578 --> 18:59.846
Yeah.

19:00.546 --> 19:01.882
Why?

19:02.915 --> 19:05.319
Keep you company.

19:06.953 --> 19:09.019
You're allergic to cats...

19:09.021 --> 19:12.556
- That's why.
- Well...

19:12.558 --> 19:15.692
Thanks. I think
I'll call him Penny.

19:15.694 --> 19:18.596
- That's good.
- How long do they live?

19:18.598 --> 19:20.597
- I don't know.
- Bob and Jessica lived what,

19:20.599 --> 19:23.569
- five, six years?
- Don't remember.

19:28.107 --> 19:31.741
So, if you start
getting any of those...

19:31.743 --> 19:33.611
feelings, if they start...

19:33.613 --> 19:35.413
Hey, we can't talk about that.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.114
I'm only twenty minutes away.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.482
- I know that.
- No, Early. No. You have to listen to me.

19:39.484 --> 19:42.619
- No. No!
- Yes.

19:42.621 --> 19:46.056
I know how
to get a hold of you.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.462
The end. Period.

19:53.832 --> 19:55.468
Okay.

19:55.967 --> 19:58.003
Bye.

19:59.004 --> 20:00.805
- Call me tonight.
- Yeah.

20:06.578 --> 20:09.415
Lock the door, please.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.768
I don't fucking care
what you want!

21:37.770 --> 21:39.803
Fuck you! You fucking whore!

21:39.805 --> 21:42.071
Don't you fucking call me,
either!

22:13.572 --> 22:15.908
Stop tapping on my wall!

23:07.792 --> 23:10.961
Oh, who is it?

23:10.963 --> 23:12.695
It's me. From next door.

23:18.904 --> 23:20.205
Hi.

23:21.339 --> 23:23.173
Evening.

23:23.175 --> 23:26.143
I was wondering if you have
some sucre I could borrow.

23:26.145 --> 23:29.281
- I'm baking brownies.
- Sure.

23:33.184 --> 23:34.751
Can I come in?

23:34.753 --> 23:37.320
Oh Lord! Lord! I'm sorry.
Please. Please.

23:37.322 --> 23:39.355
I thought you didn't want me
in your apartment...

23:39.357 --> 23:41.357
- No.
- and that didn't seem like you at all.

23:41.359 --> 23:42.358
No, no.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.826
You look so neighborly.

23:43.828 --> 23:47.232
Like Andy Griffith's
sad brother.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.637
I wonder how they got
the smell out?

23:52.704 --> 23:54.171
I beg your pardon?

23:54.173 --> 23:55.939
I beg your pardon?

23:55.941 --> 23:57.775
Where are you from? Georgia?

23:57.777 --> 24:01.310
- Mississippi.
- Miss-a-fucking-pippi!

24:01.312 --> 24:04.347
- Where there?
- A little town called Crane.

24:04.349 --> 24:06.349
Oh. It's the Deep South?

24:06.351 --> 24:09.153
About as deep as you can get,
I guess.

24:09.155 --> 24:13.292
Good. Cause I like things deep,
know what I mean?

24:15.226 --> 24:17.294
Uh...

24:17.296 --> 24:18.828
what smell?

24:18.830 --> 24:20.998
Oh, they didn't tell you,
obviously.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.465
Fascists.

24:22.467 --> 24:24.134
I thought I would do
anything for a dollar...

24:24.136 --> 24:25.736
but there are some people
in this town

24:25.738 --> 24:27.704
that will do
anything for money or fame,

24:27.706 --> 24:29.272
and you have to watch out
for them

24:29.274 --> 24:32.742
cause they will cut
your sweet heart out. So beware!

24:32.744 --> 24:35.080
I will.

24:36.281 --> 24:40.249
Mr. Bobo Celerian
died in here.

24:40.251 --> 24:43.019
He used to look at me with great
disapproval when he was sober,

24:43.021 --> 24:47.124
but when he got a little wine in him
he was capable of humping armoire's.

24:47.126 --> 24:48.291
Know what I mean?

24:48.293 --> 24:50.861
I think so.

24:50.863 --> 24:55.499
This looks like the window
of a furniture store in Topeka.

24:55.501 --> 24:58.769
Uh, thank you?

24:58.771 --> 25:01.404
Shouldn't there be
doilies everywhere?

25:01.406 --> 25:03.906
I should call you
Miss Haversham.

25:08.446 --> 25:10.780
I'm having fun with you.

25:10.782 --> 25:12.415
I thought so.

25:12.417 --> 25:15.152
Freda Von Rhenburg.

25:15.154 --> 25:16.987
Early Landry.

25:16.989 --> 25:18.387
Early?

25:18.389 --> 25:20.790
You sure you don't
want Haversham?

25:20.792 --> 25:22.925
Mm, I'll stick with Early.

25:22.927 --> 25:24.761
"I'll stick with Early."

25:24.763 --> 25:27.830
I feel like I'm talking
to Burl Ives...

25:27.832 --> 25:30.703
without the Van Dyke.

25:41.079 --> 25:43.380
That's cute.
Where'd you get that?

25:43.382 --> 25:44.847
Uh...

25:44.849 --> 25:47.550
It was my great grandfather's.

25:47.552 --> 25:51.320
I am surrounded by artifacts
from the heartland.

25:51.322 --> 25:53.824
Makes my sphincter
tighten up like a drum.

25:53.826 --> 25:57.126
Gotta run. So nice to meet you,
Haversham.

25:57.128 --> 25:59.896
Thank you.

25:59.898 --> 26:03.066
I'll bring one of my
special brownies over tomorrow.

26:03.068 --> 26:05.501
They're aphrodisiacs.

26:05.503 --> 26:07.304
- Okay.
- Lovely.

26:07.306 --> 26:09.742
Night.

27:30.188 --> 27:31.456
Morning.

27:40.366 --> 27:43.967
I really love living
near that park.

27:43.969 --> 27:47.941
Don't go over there at night
if you know what's good for you.

27:48.674 --> 27:51.040
That's sad.

27:51.042 --> 27:52.544
You're a do-gooder.

27:54.213 --> 27:56.546
Not really. No.

27:56.548 --> 27:58.318
That wasn't a question.

28:30.281 --> 28:33.115
Larry left me for fat fuck.

28:33.117 --> 28:35.352
He never had any taste, baby.

28:35.354 --> 28:37.153
He had taste
when he was with me, bitch!

28:37.155 --> 28:39.489
Not that I saw.
Never.

28:39.491 --> 28:43.693
- Never, never.
- Girl, he had the flash of a turnip.

28:43.695 --> 28:47.663
- Cauliflower.
- Yes, bitch. Fuck y'all.

28:47.665 --> 28:49.532
Wait. What, girl. Wait.

28:49.534 --> 28:51.969
He did have taste, girl.
He did. Don't leave.

28:51.971 --> 28:53.403
Girl, don't.

28:53.405 --> 28:55.439
- She always doing this shit.
- What? What?

28:55.441 --> 28:57.240
Buy me a piece of pizza?

28:57.242 --> 29:00.344
- Dine on your ass, Christmas.
- Oh, okay. Alright.

29:00.346 --> 29:02.412
Well, I have been there for you,
Freda. Don't you remember?

29:02.414 --> 29:04.314
I've been there too...

29:04.316 --> 29:06.251
What you gonna do, girl?

29:07.752 --> 29:09.553
You lucky I love you, bitch.

29:09.555 --> 29:12.288
Why I always gotta be
Mother Teresa for you all.

29:12.290 --> 29:14.124
Bitch, because you wanted
to play the role.

29:14.126 --> 29:15.325
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah, you welcome.

29:15.327 --> 29:16.692
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

29:16.694 --> 29:21.631
- I'm hungry too.
- So share. Come on.

29:21.633 --> 29:23.603
Bitch.

29:52.598 --> 29:56.098
Evening.

29:56.100 --> 30:00.739
Los Angeles has the
most beautiful moons.

30:02.307 --> 30:06.011
So, you save anyone today,
superhero?

30:07.146 --> 30:09.346
Not that I know of.

30:09.348 --> 30:11.314
But you thought about it.

30:11.316 --> 30:13.319
Maybe.

30:16.588 --> 30:19.489
Do you know
who lives under me?

30:19.491 --> 30:21.223
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:21.225 --> 30:24.129
- How'd it go?
- It went great.

30:27.331 --> 30:31.067
Hi, I'm David.

30:31.069 --> 30:32.803
Cracker.

30:32.805 --> 30:34.538
Cracker? Really?

30:34.540 --> 30:36.772
No, not really. My name's Early.
How are you?

30:36.774 --> 30:39.375
Not bad. Don't let her
fuck with you. Really.

30:39.377 --> 30:40.710
- Don't.
- No.

30:40.712 --> 30:44.050
Cool.

30:44.849 --> 30:46.452
You coming?

30:47.685 --> 30:49.586
Why not?

30:49.588 --> 30:53.289
Ramirez the Mailman
lives under you.

30:53.291 --> 30:55.092
Why, was he singing again?

30:55.094 --> 30:56.593
Yeah.

30:56.595 --> 30:59.528
Yeah. He, uh, lost his wife
three years ago.

30:59.530 --> 31:03.499
Usually he gets drunk
and sings.

31:03.501 --> 31:06.336
Don't stay up all night
drinking, Cracker.

31:06.338 --> 31:08.438
Thanks, Mom.

31:08.440 --> 31:12.111
If you were mine I'd be
beating you with a two by four.

31:13.479 --> 31:16.649
- David?
- Yeah.

31:20.786 --> 31:23.686
Early!

31:23.688 --> 31:25.724
Early!

31:26.858 --> 31:29.558
Oh my Lord!

31:29.560 --> 31:31.228
Careful, careful, careful!

31:31.230 --> 31:33.630
Here. Here. Okay, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

31:33.632 --> 31:35.198
Nice and easy.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.465
Here.

31:36.467 --> 31:38.167
Are you okay? Here.

31:38.169 --> 31:40.205
Sit down right here.
Right here, right here.

31:43.608 --> 31:45.875
- What happened?
- I got jumped.

31:45.877 --> 31:49.813
- Why?
- Why?

31:49.815 --> 31:53.316
Because Hollywood is filled
with criminals and addicts...

31:53.318 --> 31:55.751
and deviant motherfuckers.
That's why.

31:55.753 --> 31:58.654
I'll get you some ice.

31:58.656 --> 32:00.690
Did they steal anything
from you?

32:00.692 --> 32:04.461
$280 which I need to pay rent.

32:04.463 --> 32:05.795
Oh, shit...

32:05.797 --> 32:07.830
This'll take the swelling down.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.367
Here.

32:11.502 --> 32:12.602
Thank you.

32:12.604 --> 32:14.703
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:14.705 --> 32:16.141
Okay.

32:20.444 --> 32:23.313
How do people hurt
each other this way?

32:23.315 --> 32:26.786
You clearly did not grow up
in Hollywood.

32:27.786 --> 32:30.186
I once rolled a trick...

32:30.188 --> 32:31.688
and I told myself it was because
I needed the money.

32:31.690 --> 32:34.356
But it was partly because
he had bad skin,

32:34.358 --> 32:36.529
and just ruined
my fucking day that way.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.828
What did you do to him?

32:39.830 --> 32:43.599
I cracked a bottle over his head
and I punched him in the face.

32:43.601 --> 32:45.570
And then I took his money!

32:48.307 --> 32:50.472
Don't worry.

32:50.474 --> 32:53.210
I won't hurt you, Haversham.

32:53.212 --> 32:56.214
But a girl has got to take care
of herself.

32:59.751 --> 33:02.352
- Dammit!
- Where does it hurt?

33:02.354 --> 33:04.688
- It's here. In my ribs.
- Yeah.

33:04.690 --> 33:08.357
- So... fucking...
- Here, how's this side?

33:08.359 --> 33:10.426
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:10.428 --> 33:11.694
It's okay.

33:11.696 --> 33:14.533
- Easy, easy, easy...
- It's okay.

33:15.767 --> 33:18.237
Okay, they don't feel broken.

33:22.441 --> 33:27.576
I could...
I could, uh,

33:27.578 --> 33:29.382
loan you some money.

33:33.719 --> 33:37.554
- You can?
- Sure.

33:37.556 --> 33:40.457
No, Early, no. I know somebody
I can borrow it from.

33:40.459 --> 33:42.791
It's alright. It's alright, okay.
It's not a big deal.

33:42.793 --> 33:45.828
Here, let's get that ice
on that eye, okay.

33:47.465 --> 33:51.867
- There we go.
- I got it. I'm fine.

33:51.869 --> 33:53.772
Okay.

34:47.492 --> 34:49.391
Yeah?

34:49.393 --> 34:52.562
Uh, hi, it's me.
Early.

34:52.563 --> 34:53.996
What?

34:53.998 --> 34:55.833
Uh...

35:00.405 --> 35:01.740
What?

35:03.742 --> 35:05.611
Hmm.

35:07.379 --> 35:08.611
David.

35:08.613 --> 35:10.316
Welcome.

35:11.350 --> 35:12.415
Thanks.

35:15.486 --> 35:17.756
- Wanna move?
- Oh, yeah.

35:23.394 --> 35:27.730
Uh, Ramirez the Mailman
is singing again. So...

35:27.732 --> 35:29.732
I wish he could
hit a note. I really do.

35:29.734 --> 35:31.734
This is a really
sad fucking building.

35:31.736 --> 35:35.504
- It's not that sad. No, it's not.
- Yeah.

35:36.908 --> 35:38.678
How's Freda doing?

35:39.877 --> 35:41.646
Can you please not be an ass.

35:43.948 --> 35:45.415
Hey.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.015
Play Cracker that song.

35:47.017 --> 35:50.687
- No.
- Why? It's beautiful.

35:50.689 --> 35:53.890
She wrote a song about you.

35:53.892 --> 35:55.491
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

35:55.493 --> 35:58.396
It's not...
it's not about you.

36:00.865 --> 36:03.433
Just play it.

36:03.435 --> 36:07.440
Play it for him. Why you
gotta be so difficult? Hmm?

36:18.417 --> 36:19.685
David...

36:21.452 --> 36:22.655
Just play it.

Hey, daddy,
come on through.

38:18.836 --> 38:21.638
Come on, baby.

39:56.635 --> 39:58.868
- Hello?
- I have developed a rash

39:58.870 --> 40:00.837
all over my belly.

40:00.839 --> 40:06.042
You... Have you, um,
changed your detergent?

40:06.044 --> 40:07.944
<i>Well, how should I know?</i>

40:07.946 --> 40:09.979
Well, ask Graciella.

40:09.981 --> 40:12.115
It could be food related.

40:12.117 --> 40:14.149
It is not attractive.

40:14.151 --> 40:18.053
<i>And my head's about to blow off
with this wildlife fundraiser.</i>

40:18.055 --> 40:19.788
You know, I think
it's fundraiser related.

40:19.790 --> 40:22.290
It's not easy being
a good person.

40:22.292 --> 40:24.796
Aren't you a good person?

40:28.432 --> 40:30.301
What are you doing?

40:31.435 --> 40:33.269
Having drinks.

40:33.271 --> 40:36.406
- <i>With who?</i>
- With a... lady friend.

40:36.408 --> 40:38.944
<i>Um, are you drunk?</i>

40:40.912 --> 40:42.247
Maybe.

40:45.115 --> 40:48.984
You know, you're not supposed to
be drinking on your meds, Early.

40:48.986 --> 40:51.687
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna say good afternoon.

40:51.689 --> 40:53.423
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

40:53.425 --> 40:55.394
Okay.

41:09.073 --> 41:11.276
Be right there.

41:22.854 --> 41:24.986
Howdy, neighbor.

41:24.988 --> 41:27.859
I brought you some
southern haute cuisine food.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.859
Donuts!

41:30.861 --> 41:33.796
What every Southern boy
needs to survive.

41:33.798 --> 41:38.167
Thank you. I'll save
at least one for dessert.

41:38.169 --> 41:40.973
After my fried chicken
and pig's feet.

41:42.774 --> 41:45.310
Never thought
I'd see you again.

41:47.178 --> 41:49.415
Why wouldn't you
see me again?

41:50.314 --> 41:51.379
Donut?

41:51.381 --> 41:53.415
Oh...

41:53.417 --> 41:55.450
Oh, I see.

41:55.452 --> 41:58.087
I borrow a little money from
you, don't show up for a week

41:58.089 --> 42:01.089
and you think, what, I ran off
to Mexico or some shit?

42:01.091 --> 42:02.892
Because I'm just some bottom

42:02.894 --> 42:04.493
- No.
- of the barrel girl with no morals...

42:04.495 --> 42:06.828
or motherfucking scruples?

42:06.830 --> 42:11.234
I have been working my ass to the
bone to pay you back your $300.

42:11.236 --> 42:14.537
But that's not good enough
for Mr. Uptight Whitey.

42:14.539 --> 42:17.140
"That white trash girl
stole my money

42:17.142 --> 42:20.979
and I never saw her again".
Fuck you!

42:50.475 --> 42:54.944
I didn't mean you were
uptight whitey man, alright.

42:54.946 --> 42:58.183
Although you have some of
the tendencies, honey.

43:01.285 --> 43:03.218
Look, I just...

43:03.220 --> 43:05.254
I'm always on the lookout for
people to treat me like shit

43:05.256 --> 43:10.896
because I dress a certain way
or my general thing.

43:14.031 --> 43:15.334
Hey...

43:19.370 --> 43:21.272
Hey...

43:27.511 --> 43:30.515
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thank you.

43:32.584 --> 43:36.953
It's just that today is
Indian Paint Brush Day.

43:36.955 --> 43:38.587
What the fuck is that?

43:38.589 --> 43:40.189
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:40.191 --> 43:43.225
What is
Indian Paint Brush Day?

43:43.227 --> 43:45.060
They're my wife's
favorite flower.

43:45.062 --> 43:46.462
They're all over
where I lived.

43:46.464 --> 43:50.600
When I was 10,
I picked a bunch for her.

43:50.602 --> 43:53.105
How long were you married?

43:54.472 --> 43:57.406
26 years.

43:57.408 --> 43:59.941
Car wreck.

43:59.943 --> 44:01.377
I knew...

44:01.379 --> 44:03.912
I had to get the brakes fixed.
I mean,

44:03.914 --> 44:05.915
I knew they had
to be fixed

44:05.917 --> 44:08.084
because I do everything when
it was supposed to be done.

44:08.086 --> 44:10.986
Everything I do is when
it's supposed to be done.

44:10.988 --> 44:14.525
I mean, I'm in the insurance
business for God's sake.

44:16.961 --> 44:19.395
Drink.

44:19.397 --> 44:21.934
Drink your tight ass away.

44:27.305 --> 44:28.874
Here.

44:33.243 --> 44:35.046
Look.

44:39.550 --> 44:41.950
Give me your hands.

44:41.952 --> 44:43.151
Okay.

44:43.153 --> 44:45.053
- Give me your hands.
- Okay.

44:45.055 --> 44:47.158
Well, get the damn donut
out of it.

44:49.961 --> 44:51.530
Let me...

45:02.006 --> 45:03.538
You don't have to do...

45:03.540 --> 45:07.979
or be anything
you don't want to be.

45:09.647 --> 45:11.948
You understand?

45:11.950 --> 45:14.082
Hide from
those motherfuckers

45:14.084 --> 45:17.252
or stick your twat
in their face.

45:17.254 --> 45:20.559
The only lie is the one
that you say is a lie.

45:22.026 --> 45:24.160
Invent yourself.

45:24.162 --> 45:27.430
Be a little fucking creative.

45:27.432 --> 45:30.098
Just keep a roof
over your head

45:30.100 --> 45:32.100
and a full belly.

45:32.102 --> 45:34.138
These are the only rules.

45:35.006 --> 45:37.506
There.

45:37.508 --> 45:40.075
Now it looks like the biggest
trauma you've had to deal with

45:40.077 --> 45:42.511
is what color Dockers
to wear in the mornings.

45:45.216 --> 45:46.415
Wow!

45:46.417 --> 45:49.021
Super cream. Rite-Aid.

45:49.586 --> 45:50.988
Huh...

46:02.265 --> 46:03.698
What are these?

46:03.700 --> 46:07.102
Oh, no, they're, um...

46:07.104 --> 46:09.071
They're... nothing.

46:09.073 --> 46:12.375
Just tell me what they are,
Haversham.

46:12.377 --> 46:14.009
They're...

46:14.011 --> 46:15.613
they're just...

46:19.082 --> 46:22.752
letters from my wife
when I was away in college.

46:22.754 --> 46:24.522
Read one.

46:26.656 --> 46:29.424
No, I can't.

46:29.426 --> 46:31.526
Oh, why not? 'Cause I'm not
sensitive enough

46:31.528 --> 46:34.397
- or deep enough or some shit?
- No.

46:34.399 --> 46:37.035
Fuck it. I don't care.

46:52.482 --> 46:53.751
I can't...

46:56.486 --> 46:58.087
Uh...

46:58.089 --> 47:00.525
This is my freshman year
at Ole Miss.

47:07.798 --> 47:09.631
"Dear Chim Chim."

47:09.633 --> 47:12.334
The little monkey
from Speed Racer.

47:12.336 --> 47:15.540
- Just read and don't stop.
- Oh.

47:17.274 --> 47:20.709
Okay. "It's getting
cold here, too.

47:20.711 --> 47:22.243
I love it when it's cold.

47:22.245 --> 47:23.745
Sunshine cuddles with me

47:23.747 --> 47:27.149
and tells me how much
she misses her Early."

47:27.151 --> 47:31.587
Uh... Sunshine was this tabby
that Lara had got.

47:31.589 --> 47:36.191
You are bludgeoning the fucking
mood, honey. Come on. Come on.

47:36.193 --> 47:38.828
Okay.

47:38.830 --> 47:41.600
"I can't wait for...

47:42.533 --> 47:44.533
Saturday night.

47:44.535 --> 47:47.336
Where are we going?
Not that I care.

47:47.338 --> 47:51.307
It's enough just to
have you home.

47:51.309 --> 47:54.310
If we don't have
any special plans

47:54.312 --> 47:56.845
we could go to the
Homecoming Dance?

47:56.847 --> 47:59.515
Please, please, please!

47:59.517 --> 48:02.587
What about the game?
We play McComb.

48:03.687 --> 48:05.254
I have two tests
to study for

48:05.256 --> 48:07.288
but I am trying to get
all my work done

48:07.290 --> 48:10.528
before my Chim Chim
comes back to me.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.438
Can we fly a kite?

48:25.609 --> 48:29.645
Jimmy's been asking about it
all week and I said

48:29.647 --> 48:32.150
maybe when Early comes home.

48:34.452 --> 48:35.750
I miss you so much.

48:35.752 --> 48:37.886
My heart aches
that you might fall

48:37.888 --> 48:40.388
for some sorority girl.

48:40.390 --> 48:43.926
I know that's crazy.

48:43.928 --> 48:49.497
I just know that Crane
is empty without you.

48:49.499 --> 48:52.334
Come home to me and teach me
about the stars

48:52.336 --> 48:55.404
in the middle
of the graveyard.

48:55.406 --> 48:59.578
Weirdo. Just kidding,"
in parenthesis.

49:00.877 --> 49:05.350
"I love you... Mary."

49:13.925 --> 49:18.763
I used to take her
to graveyards.

49:21.932 --> 49:24.635
And she still loved me.

49:29.472 --> 49:32.143
Take me to a graveyard.

49:35.613 --> 49:38.316
Tell me about the stars.

50:27.999 --> 50:32.500
This is a May sky
in Los Angeles.

50:32.502 --> 50:34.703
I always try and
orient myself by finding

50:34.705 --> 50:36.872
Ursa Minor, which you would call
the Little Dipper.

50:36.874 --> 50:41.410
I do that because the North Star
is the brightest star in the sky.

50:41.412 --> 50:42.910
Hence, the easiest to find.

50:42.912 --> 50:45.314
Now, in May,
he would be here.

50:45.316 --> 50:47.850
Are all the stars
going to be he's?

50:47.852 --> 50:50.685
Some of them are she's.
Please try and concentrate.

50:50.687 --> 50:54.555
If you follow the handle
of the Dipper down, down, down,

50:54.557 --> 50:57.725
- you come to the tip...
- I thought this would be more romantic.

50:57.727 --> 50:59.727
Less mind-suckingly dry.

50:59.729 --> 51:02.430
You don't have much
of an attention span.

51:02.432 --> 51:05.869
Oh, did Mary have
a long attention span?

51:12.709 --> 51:14.709
I'm sorry.

51:14.711 --> 51:16.447
That was wrong of me.

51:18.048 --> 51:20.549
You just...
You can't be cruel.

51:20.551 --> 51:25.290
I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

51:33.798 --> 51:36.564
Now, at the bottom
of the Dipper...

51:36.566 --> 51:37.866
you get to the very bottom...

51:37.868 --> 51:40.505
- Okay, can I say something?
- Yes.

51:41.439 --> 51:43.104
Of course.

51:43.106 --> 51:46.607
You should know,
I'm insecure.

51:46.609 --> 51:50.011
And I might be naturally mean.
I don't know.

51:50.013 --> 51:52.647
But you can't run away
like some baby

51:52.649 --> 51:55.750
just 'cause I say something that's not
up to your sense of good fucking taste

51:55.752 --> 51:57.521
or whatever.

52:06.363 --> 52:08.899
- Oh, Freda.
- Fuck it.

52:10.468 --> 52:14.435
- Freda, please. Don't take them.
- Why not?

52:14.437 --> 52:16.471
Because you're addicted
to them.

52:16.473 --> 52:18.140
Oh, I'm addicted, huh?

52:18.142 --> 52:20.475
You can sit there and talk to me
about being addicted to pills

52:20.477 --> 52:23.080
when you're washing down
Xanax with bourbon.

52:25.082 --> 52:28.450
- You're right.
- Thank you.

52:28.452 --> 52:31.022
You are right.

52:43.566 --> 52:45.901
Oh, hell no! Fuck that.

52:45.903 --> 52:47.102
No!

52:47.104 --> 52:48.970
You know how much these cost?

52:48.972 --> 52:52.174
- Freda, give me your pills.
- I'm not addicted, Early.

52:52.176 --> 52:55.880
I have aches.
And they help.

52:57.714 --> 53:00.515
I don't care
if I am addicted.

53:00.517 --> 53:02.618
Fuck it! I don't.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.419
No more pills. Come on.

53:04.421 --> 53:05.754
I don't trust you.

53:05.756 --> 53:08.960
Freda, I'm here.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.664
I'm not going anywhere.

53:15.165 --> 53:16.767
Come on.

53:36.553 --> 53:39.187
You're supposed to...
dissolve them in water

53:39.189 --> 53:41.689
before you flush them
down the toilet.

53:41.691 --> 53:44.926
There's some fucking dolphins out
there getting high as a kite

53:44.928 --> 53:47.696
and here we are,
fucking sober.

53:47.698 --> 53:49.464
- I don't want to do this tonight!
- ...them back to you, Freda.

53:49.466 --> 53:51.600
- I don't want to do this tonight!
- Freda!

53:51.602 --> 53:53.569
Where is it, Early?
Where are they?!

53:53.571 --> 53:55.636
They're not in here, Freda.

53:55.638 --> 53:58.073
- They're not in here.
- You're a liar! Stop lying to me!

53:58.075 --> 54:00.475
Come on.

54:00.477 --> 54:03.044
Okay, Freda, I didn't put pills
in the freezer.

54:03.046 --> 54:06.915
- What are you looking for?
- Frozen yogurt, bitch.

54:06.917 --> 54:08.649
- You want some ice?
- Shut up!

54:17.127 --> 54:19.495
Freda...

54:19.497 --> 54:23.701
Give me my pills or I will throw
this fucking rat against the wall!

54:25.935 --> 54:27.636
Freda, no!

54:31.742 --> 54:34.912
<i>Give me my fucking pills!</i>

54:48.559 --> 54:50.859
Yeah...

54:50.861 --> 54:54.662
Yeah, despite all your
love letters and your stars,

54:54.664 --> 54:58.767
you really fucking hate me.

54:58.769 --> 55:02.004
That's why you're killing me.

55:02.006 --> 55:04.640
That's why you killed her.

55:04.642 --> 55:06.542
Keep talking. Just keep
saying whatever you want.

55:06.544 --> 55:07.942
Just give me the pills, okay?

55:07.944 --> 55:09.912
- The pills?
- Please!

55:09.914 --> 55:13.714
- Fine!
- Just one, Early. Just one. One fucking pill.

55:13.716 --> 55:16.119
- Okay.
- No!

55:19.122 --> 55:20.788
No! No!

55:20.790 --> 55:22.991
No!

55:22.993 --> 55:24.258
No!

55:24.260 --> 55:27.662
You threw them away!

55:33.303 --> 55:37.272
<i>♪ I could never see... ♪</i>

55:37.274 --> 55:39.575
<i>♪ Tomorrow ♪</i>

55:39.577 --> 55:45.917
<i>♪ I was never told
about the sorrow ♪</i>

55:49.986 --> 55:53.087
<i>♪ How can you mend ♪</i>

55:53.089 --> 55:56.091
<i>♪ A broken heart ♪</i>

55:56.093 --> 55:59.230
- <i>♪ How can... ♪</i>
- Shh.

56:28.258 --> 56:29.890
Did I hurt you?

56:29.892 --> 56:32.194
No, no.

56:32.196 --> 56:36.330
You did threaten to gouge my
intestines out through my anus.

56:36.332 --> 56:39.301
- But that was just talk.
- Sorry.

56:39.303 --> 56:42.703
No. Don't, don't, don't.

56:42.705 --> 56:45.676
When I was 10,
I called my dad a cunt.

56:46.810 --> 56:49.243
And what did he say?

56:49.245 --> 56:50.714
Nothing.

56:51.749 --> 56:54.116
He just closed the door.

56:54.118 --> 56:56.852
Slowly.

56:56.854 --> 57:00.354
He wanted me to study harder but
my hormones were out of whack

57:00.356 --> 57:02.857
so concentration was not
my strong suit,

57:02.859 --> 57:04.859
you know what I'm saying?

57:04.861 --> 57:08.298
He just didn't know
what to do with me.

57:09.365 --> 57:12.033
I hope he's not dead.

57:12.035 --> 57:14.338
Maybe...

57:15.205 --> 57:16.671
call him.

57:16.673 --> 57:18.906
I don't know.

57:18.908 --> 57:21.311
Luckily, I had my gran.

57:23.180 --> 57:26.881
My gran taught me
how to garden.

57:26.883 --> 57:30.317
She taught me all about
roses and...

57:30.319 --> 57:33.821
you know, ever since then
I've wanted to be in a garden.

57:33.823 --> 57:36.058
Taking care of things

57:36.060 --> 57:39.697
and designing things.

57:41.097 --> 57:45.167
I can do something
else with my life.

57:45.169 --> 57:47.038
I can do things.

57:50.339 --> 57:52.774
Can't I?

57:52.776 --> 57:55.213
When I first got here...

57:56.113 --> 57:58.245
I had a pulse.

57:58.247 --> 58:01.249
That was about it.

58:01.251 --> 58:04.321
That, and a desire to die.

58:07.857 --> 58:09.894
I didn't.

58:11.060 --> 58:13.765
You've already done something.

59:17.894 --> 59:20.163
Goodnight, Early.

59:42.252 --> 59:43.855
What's wrong?

59:44.488 --> 59:45.953
Nothing.

59:45.955 --> 59:47.758
<i>Yes, there is.</i>

59:49.593 --> 59:52.259
I have a friend.
I want you and Jack and Ted

59:52.261 --> 59:53.964
to come over
for dinner Saturday.

59:54.865 --> 59:56.064
Really?

59:56.066 --> 59:58.399
- What's her name?
- <i>Freda.</i>

59:58.401 --> 01:00:00.167
Freda?

01:00:00.169 --> 01:00:02.773
What kind of a name is Freda?
Is she a prostitute?

01:00:04.441 --> 01:00:08.212
Yes. And she has Ebola and
she's a war criminal.

01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:10.979
<i>8:00, Saturday?</i>

01:00:10.981 --> 01:00:14.015
Fine. What should we bring?
Crack?

01:00:14.017 --> 01:00:15.950
Or wine. Bye.

01:00:15.952 --> 01:00:17.487
<i>Bye.</i>

01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:29.964
Oh, my Lord!

01:00:29.966 --> 01:00:31.165
Oh, Lord.

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:33.234
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord...

01:00:33.236 --> 01:00:34.872
Brianna!

01:00:37.173 --> 01:00:39.607
Brianna!
Brianna?

01:00:39.609 --> 01:00:44.381
- David?
- No, it's Early. Come on. All right.

01:00:49.051 --> 01:00:50.986
I'm a mess.

01:00:50.988 --> 01:00:52.557
Tonight.

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.424
Oh, come on.

01:00:57.426 --> 01:01:00.028
Here we go.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.196
Don't touch my lady parts.

01:01:02.198 --> 01:01:04.534
Absolutely not.

01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:14.544
Are you okay?

01:01:18.281 --> 01:01:21.986
He doesn't love me.

01:01:22.986 --> 01:01:25.223
Sleep.

01:01:32.062 --> 01:01:35.196
He's such an asshole!

01:01:35.198 --> 01:01:36.598
He's a musician, honey.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.066
No. That can't be his excuse.

01:01:39.068 --> 01:01:41.937
And all I want to do is just look
at him and just ask him why,

01:01:41.939 --> 01:01:45.142
but he wouldn't even know
what I was asking him.

01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:47.578
Fuck men.

01:01:50.479 --> 01:01:52.482
Except for Early.

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:58.118
Except for Early.

01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:05.660
B...

01:02:05.662 --> 01:02:09.433
you want to come in and listen
to some records with me?

01:02:13.537 --> 01:02:16.004
Is...
Is that a...

01:02:16.006 --> 01:02:18.643
is that a no?

01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:23.712
Okay.

01:02:23.714 --> 01:02:26.046
Freda, what about you?

01:02:26.048 --> 01:02:29.049
You want to come in and
listen to some records with me?

01:02:29.051 --> 01:02:31.653
Oh, Daddy, you're just too much
man, aren't you?

01:02:33.323 --> 01:02:36.961
I'd rather get eaten
by a shark, bitch. Okay?

01:02:46.602 --> 01:02:48.636
So, let me ask you this,

01:02:48.638 --> 01:02:50.205
have you fucked him?

01:02:50.207 --> 01:02:52.307
No.

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:54.441
But you in love with him?

01:02:54.443 --> 01:02:57.011
- It's better than that.
- Oh, it better be a whole lot better.

01:02:57.013 --> 01:03:00.482
Cause the Freda I know
is a Santa Monica Boulevard ho.

01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:04.151
And that's all, baby.
Nothing more. That's you.

01:03:04.153 --> 01:03:05.720
Love is a fiction, girl.

01:03:05.722 --> 01:03:10.258
It's not for those
who are me.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.428
That's the first thing I agree
with all goddamn night, okay.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:14.763
And you know that bitch
ain't got no sense.

01:03:14.765 --> 01:03:16.663
- I want a life.
- Bitch, I got one,

01:03:16.665 --> 01:03:18.633
and you can make
your own hours, okay.

01:03:18.635 --> 01:03:21.169
Listen, I'm just saying
we have to save ourselves

01:03:21.171 --> 01:03:23.370
from those motherfuckers. Cause
he ain't me or you, he is them,

01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:25.372
and, bitch,
you know that's right.

01:03:25.374 --> 01:03:28.375
Girl! How are you going
to afford the hormones?

01:03:28.377 --> 01:03:32.580
What, you gonna get a 9-5 and
move in with him or something?

01:03:32.582 --> 01:03:34.417
Good luck, Christmas.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.254
No. Good luck, Freda.

01:03:40.256 --> 01:03:42.325
See you in a week or two.

01:03:44.693 --> 01:03:47.227
I got a double-double
yesterday, Uncle Early.

01:03:47.229 --> 01:03:49.163
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:03:49.165 --> 01:03:50.832
Yeah, he can handle the ball.
He's not quite the superstar

01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:53.700
- in the classroom now, is he.
- Is it one fucking B!

01:03:53.702 --> 01:03:55.538
Excuse me?

01:03:56.839 --> 01:03:59.709
So, what does Freda do?

01:04:01.243 --> 01:04:03.511
You know, customer service,
selling stuff.

01:04:03.513 --> 01:04:05.249
Is she your girlfriend?

01:04:06.348 --> 01:04:07.582
I don't know.

01:04:07.584 --> 01:04:09.149
What's for dinner?

01:04:14.256 --> 01:04:16.390
Hi.

01:04:16.392 --> 01:04:17.660
Come on in. Come on in.

01:04:18.662 --> 01:04:20.395
Hello.

01:04:20.397 --> 01:04:23.200
Everybody, this is Freda.

01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:33.107
- Hi. Ted Sachman. Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:35.176
And this is my sister,
Laurette.

01:04:35.178 --> 01:04:36.611
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:04:36.613 --> 01:04:39.147
- Heard a lot about you.
- Oh no.

01:04:39.149 --> 01:04:40.615
- Her son, Jack.
- Hey, Jack.

01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:42.316
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:04:42.318 --> 01:04:45.221
- Good.
- Have a seat, Freda.

01:04:48.492 --> 01:04:50.725
Whoo.
We're packed in tight, here.

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:59.500
Um, Jack has
his first boyfriend.

01:04:59.502 --> 01:05:02.136
Girlfriend! Brittany.

01:05:02.138 --> 01:05:04.238
How is she?

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.607
Great. You know,
but possessive.

01:05:06.609 --> 01:05:08.810
Isn't that the way.

01:05:08.812 --> 01:05:11.145
It's all new to me.

01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:14.348
- First love is great.
- Well, I don't know if we're in love,

01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:15.883
I mean, we haven't
even slept together.

01:05:15.885 --> 01:05:18.520
Quiet. I don't know where
he gets this stuff from.

01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:21.522
- It freaks me out.
- Well, he's right.

01:05:21.524 --> 01:05:26.361
How can you be in love if you
haven't slept with the person?

01:05:26.363 --> 01:05:27.761
Not that I'm
condoning that.

01:05:27.763 --> 01:05:30.798
It's way too young
for sexual activity.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.500
I was 19.

01:05:32.502 --> 01:05:37.208
Sixteen, but really together.
And it was a mistake.

01:05:40.577 --> 01:05:43.714
Early says you like
the Bon-Bons from Toucher.

01:05:45.414 --> 01:05:48.183
I do.
I do.

01:05:48.185 --> 01:05:50.721
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:52.522 --> 01:05:54.756
I need to get that other
chair from the bedroom.

01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:57.194
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.533
I'm gonna, um...

01:06:06.535 --> 01:06:08.606
I'm gonna run to the restroom
really quick. Excuse me.

01:06:10.774 --> 01:06:12.776
Wow.

01:06:14.443 --> 01:06:16.810
How about Uncle Early?

01:06:16.812 --> 01:06:18.546
- Ow!
- Laurette. Laurette...

01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:20.647
- What?!
- You need to hold it together

01:06:20.649 --> 01:06:23.884
- for your brother, alright?
- I don't need to do anything.

01:06:23.886 --> 01:06:25.587
- Please.
- I mean, I like her.

01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:27.388
I mean, she brought
you bon-bons.

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:28.823
I need you to be quiet.
Do you understand me, Jack?

01:06:28.825 --> 01:06:30.325
- Say nothing stupid.
- Will you be cool?

01:06:30.327 --> 01:06:32.396
In fact, say nothing.

01:06:35.265 --> 01:06:36.830
So, you live next door?

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:39.366
- Yeah.
- I love this building.

01:06:39.368 --> 01:06:40.634
It's not bad.

01:06:40.636 --> 01:06:43.571
I was glad
when Early moved in.

01:06:43.573 --> 01:06:46.274
Somebody normal.

01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:48.343
- Wine, Freda?
- That'd be great. Yeah.

01:06:48.345 --> 01:06:49.810
- Thank you.
- Red? White?

01:06:49.812 --> 01:06:52.249
- Um, white, thank you.
- White.

01:06:57.754 --> 01:07:00.455
So, you work
for the studios?

01:07:00.457 --> 01:07:03.258
Laurette works for Sony
in development.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.792
I'm partners in a
post-production house.

01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:07.761
- Wow!
- It's right here in Hollywood.

01:07:07.763 --> 01:07:10.700
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:14.701
- A toast?
- Mmm.

01:07:14.703 --> 01:07:17.037
To family and friends.

01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:19.876
Cheers.

01:07:24.948 --> 01:07:28.448
So, Freda, what do you do?

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.417
- What?
- I...

01:07:30.419 --> 01:07:32.419
Jesus...

01:07:32.421 --> 01:07:35.589
- What?
- Nothing.

01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:38.993
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:38.995 --> 01:07:41.296
Uh, I'm in-between things
right now.

01:07:41.298 --> 01:07:44.598
Early told us that you sold
trinkets and baubles and things.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.569
I do. Yeah.
That's a sideline.

01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:49.770
What are you looking for?

01:07:49.772 --> 01:07:51.372
Astronaut work.

01:07:51.374 --> 01:07:53.341
I'd like to be
the first person on Mars.

01:07:53.343 --> 01:07:55.075
You have to have a lot of math for that.

01:07:55.077 --> 01:07:59.647
I'm kidding. I used to think
I wanted to be an actress.

01:07:59.649 --> 01:08:01.816
Well, why not?

01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:04.519
- Lots of different people are actors.
- Everybody's got a dream.

01:08:04.521 --> 01:08:07.354
Oh, it's not really
my dream.

01:08:07.356 --> 01:08:09.790
Uh, Freda wants to go
into landscaping.

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:12.093
- You know, I thought of that, too.
- Really?

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:14.529
- When I was younger.
- She has a green thumb.

01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:17.468
Yeah.
I have a thing for plants.

01:08:19.968 --> 01:08:24.072
Uh, Brittany wants me to try out
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> at school.

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:27.041
Yeah. That's just what you need,
another extra-curricular.

01:08:27.042 --> 01:08:28.776
Why?

01:08:28.778 --> 01:08:30.478
'Cause I can sing.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:34.081
Well, it's nice that
she likes your voice.

01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:36.117
Early sung to me once.

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:37.484
Ohh...

01:08:37.486 --> 01:08:38.752
What'd you sing, Early?

01:08:38.754 --> 01:08:41.956
- It's...
- Don't be shy.

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:43.359
Tell them.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.095
<i>♪ How can you mend
a broken heart? ♪</i>

01:08:48.096 --> 01:08:50.063
She stopped me after
the first verse.

01:08:50.064 --> 01:08:53.934
I had a headache.

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:57.939
A good singing voice
is not necessary.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:01.843
For what?

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:03.611
- Laurette...
- What?

01:09:03.613 --> 01:09:06.015
No. For what?

01:09:07.883 --> 01:09:10.585
I'm sorry. I think
this is ridiculous,

01:09:10.587 --> 01:09:12.386
and I want to know for what.

01:09:12.388 --> 01:09:14.054
For having sex?

01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.590
Okay. That's enough, Laurette!

01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:17.558
- Is it?
- For God's sake, Laurette!

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.660
Oh Ted, I'm sorry.
If you don't like it, tough.

01:09:19.662 --> 01:09:21.528
- Take him outside, okay?
- Stop it.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.130
- Are you fucking my brother?
- That is...

01:09:23.131 --> 01:09:26.000
I'm sorry, are you having
sex with my brother?

01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:28.736
I don't understand
what we're doing here.

01:09:28.738 --> 01:09:31.104
This pretending?
It's fucked up!

01:09:31.106 --> 01:09:33.741
I don't... what are you going
to be, my next sister-in-law?

01:09:33.743 --> 01:09:35.609
- Or whatever!
- Quiet, Laurette!

01:09:35.611 --> 01:09:38.112
I have a right to know!
It's a really simple question.

01:09:38.113 --> 01:09:39.781
Just give me an answer!

01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:42.685
Obviously, I am your
worst fucking nightmare,

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.685
you uptight...

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:47.554
Westside freaking cunt!

01:09:47.555 --> 01:09:50.858
Real nice! Very nice!

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:52.563
Very nice.

01:09:56.766 --> 01:09:58.635
Freda.

01:10:01.471 --> 01:10:05.072
- That was bullshit, Mom.
- Don't talk to me like that.

01:10:05.074 --> 01:10:06.974
That was bullshit, Laurette.

01:10:06.976 --> 01:10:09.777
Freda.

01:10:09.779 --> 01:10:12.612
Freda, please.
Open the door, alright.

01:10:13.982 --> 01:10:15.918
Freda.

01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:22.490
I don't know how...
aware he is.

01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:25.760
And I will do anything
to protect him. Anything.

01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:28.899
- But isn't it just love?
- Quiet!

01:10:30.533 --> 01:10:32.500
The man is 55 years old.

01:10:32.502 --> 01:10:35.102
Yeah. And he's just been
through a terrifying trauma,

01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:36.839
and tried to kill himself.

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:43.643
It's been nice having you.

01:10:43.645 --> 01:10:44.978
There will be no dinner tonight.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.680
You have to go wait in the car.
I'm sorry.

01:10:46.682 --> 01:10:49.951
No, I think...
I think we can work this out.

01:10:49.953 --> 01:10:52.122
- Go wait outside, son.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:00.193
How is she, Early?

01:11:00.195 --> 01:11:01.929
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:03.096
I am not leaving
until I talk to you.

01:11:03.098 --> 01:11:04.599
I don't want to talk to you.

01:11:04.601 --> 01:11:05.899
Well, I want to know
what you're doing

01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:07.602
and I think
I have a right to ask.

01:11:07.604 --> 01:11:09.636
Who gave you that right?
Hmm? Certainly not me.

01:11:09.638 --> 01:11:12.506
- Uh. You're my brother!
- I don't care about that, Laurette.

01:11:12.508 --> 01:11:14.608
And I may never care
about that again.

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.946
You hurt her, Laurette.

01:11:19.882 --> 01:11:20.983
Are you gay?

01:11:22.952 --> 01:11:25.685
- No! No!
- Well, is this person you're with,

01:11:25.687 --> 01:11:27.654
- does she have a vagina?
- Oh my God!

01:11:27.656 --> 01:11:29.189
I don't have to answer
that question.

01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:31.157
Have you lost
your mind, Early?

01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:33.827
Stop! Okay!
Laurette, no more.

01:11:33.829 --> 01:11:34.862
Okay?

01:11:34.864 --> 01:11:39.166
Leave... my... house.

01:11:39.168 --> 01:11:41.801
- Let's go. Come on.
- You know the difference, Early.

01:11:41.803 --> 01:11:43.203
I know you do.

01:11:43.205 --> 01:11:45.005
- And you're not gay.
- God dammit!

01:11:45.007 --> 01:11:46.840
What, I don't care if he's gay!

01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:48.910
Are you kidding me.
He doesn't know what he's doing!

01:11:48.912 --> 01:11:51.582
And one more thing...

01:11:55.552 --> 01:11:57.554
what would Mary think?

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:11.232
Early? Are you home?

01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:15.239
Anybody home?

01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:22.044
You're not home.

01:12:23.712 --> 01:12:25.681
Call me.

01:12:27.617 --> 01:12:30.087
Did you go to Brentwood?

01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.188
Fucking Brentwood.

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:54.041
Early, where are you?

01:12:54.043 --> 01:12:58.582
Are you hiding out with your
sister, the bitch from hell?

01:12:59.681 --> 01:13:00.983
I'm just kidding.

01:13:01.784 --> 01:13:03.250
Oh, fuck it!

01:13:16.999 --> 01:13:18.799
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:22.239
Maybe you're just at the
fucking Jiffy Lube or something.

01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:28.979
I need you.

01:13:31.814 --> 01:13:35.084
<i>You're in your world,
aren't you Early?</i>

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.623
You made your choice.

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:47.394
Early, I'm going
to San Francisco.

01:13:47.396 --> 01:13:49.198
Yeah.

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.936
Going.

01:13:53.436 --> 01:13:55.806
Going.

01:13:56.873 --> 01:13:59.076
Gone.

01:14:21.998 --> 01:14:25.465
Cracker! Oh my God,
you look like shit.

01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:28.337
What's wrong with you?

01:14:29.404 --> 01:14:33.142
Early, this is, uh, Sonya.

01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:36.343
You look like my dad.

01:14:39.082 --> 01:14:41.151
What's up?

01:14:45.187 --> 01:14:47.289
Speechless?

01:14:52.994 --> 01:14:55.395
What's the matter, Crack?

01:14:55.397 --> 01:14:57.965
What's going on?

01:14:57.967 --> 01:14:59.899
He has a broken heart.

01:14:59.901 --> 01:15:02.338
Oh, fuck.

01:15:03.138 --> 01:15:06.139
Fuck.

01:15:06.141 --> 01:15:08.008
I got just the thing
for my man, then.

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:11.845
- No, you don't.
- I think I do.

01:15:11.847 --> 01:15:13.917
I think I do.

01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:18.184
It's so funny, Early.

01:15:18.186 --> 01:15:20.420
I say I love him,

01:15:20.422 --> 01:15:23.260
but it's not actually true...

01:15:26.495 --> 01:15:28.763
because how could I possibly

01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:31.368
give up my whole life
for this shit fuck.

01:15:33.202 --> 01:15:36.138
Because I know
he wouldn't for me.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.149
You don't want that, Early.
You don't want that.

01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:50.885
People should do
what they want to do.

01:15:50.887 --> 01:15:52.952
If he wants to do it
let him do it.

01:15:52.954 --> 01:15:55.555
No, you don't want that.

01:15:55.557 --> 01:15:58.058
David!

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.460
David! Stop!

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.907
Time to go home, Early.

01:16:20.182 --> 01:16:21.816
Never...

01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:23.184
never do that shit.

01:16:23.186 --> 01:16:26.586
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:16:26.588 --> 01:16:31.093
I promise, Brianna.
I won't ever, ever do it.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:44.173
I gotta get out of town.

01:17:30.953 --> 01:17:32.522
Early.

01:17:34.489 --> 01:17:36.392
David.

01:17:37.894 --> 01:17:39.460
I'm sorry...

01:17:39.462 --> 01:17:42.464
for trying to
give you heroin.

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:47.269
That was clearly out of bounds.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:56.312
Have you seen Brianna?

01:17:57.913 --> 01:18:00.179
I think I messed that up.

01:18:00.181 --> 01:18:02.515
Does it matter to you?
I mean, does it really matter?

01:18:02.517 --> 01:18:05.555
Yeah. Of course it matters.

01:18:08.024 --> 01:18:10.557
But...

01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:15.364
that shit scares me.
You know?

01:18:32.315 --> 01:18:34.985
- Hi, Uncle Early.
- Jack.

01:18:36.485 --> 01:18:39.353
- Everything okay?
- It's okay.

01:18:39.355 --> 01:18:42.288
- Grades are good, you know?
- That's good.

01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:44.561
Basketball's good.

01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:50.163
Brittney and I did it.

01:18:50.165 --> 01:18:52.202
You know what I mean?

01:18:53.569 --> 01:18:55.135
Did you enjoy it?

01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:58.572
It was great. But that's...

01:18:58.574 --> 01:19:00.340
that's all I can
think about now.

01:19:00.342 --> 01:19:02.142
Yeah.

01:19:02.144 --> 01:19:04.013
It's crazy that way.

01:19:05.247 --> 01:19:07.150
I think I love her.

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:09.683
But I'm...

01:19:09.685 --> 01:19:12.353
I mean, I'm not sure.

01:19:12.355 --> 01:19:14.391
That's beautiful, Jack.

01:19:17.159 --> 01:19:20.160
I miss you, Uncle Early.

01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:22.295
Miss you, too.

01:19:22.297 --> 01:19:24.497
So does Mom.

01:19:24.499 --> 01:19:27.100
She's out in the car.

01:19:27.102 --> 01:19:29.002
Can you talk to her?

01:19:29.004 --> 01:19:31.638
It'll give us some
breathing room around the house.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.177
It's nightmarish.

01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:37.513
Early?

01:19:40.482 --> 01:19:42.215
Okay.

01:19:42.217 --> 01:19:44.550
Thanks.

01:19:44.552 --> 01:19:48.421
You know, I-I liked...
I liked Freda.

01:19:48.423 --> 01:19:49.959
Thanks.

01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:54.495
She's so crazy.

01:19:54.497 --> 01:19:56.229
- Oh, no. My mom. That's...
- Oh.

01:19:56.231 --> 01:19:58.501
Yeah. Sorry.

01:20:02.303 --> 01:20:04.470
- Hi.
- Point proven.

01:20:04.472 --> 01:20:06.743
- Thank you, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

01:20:15.517 --> 01:20:17.020
Dinner, Saturday night?

01:20:18.154 --> 01:20:19.321
Can't Saturday.

01:20:23.793 --> 01:20:25.792
Raised 3.2 million

01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:28.127
for that, uh,
endangered, um,

01:20:28.129 --> 01:20:32.299
species, uh, thing.
That benefit.

01:20:32.301 --> 01:20:35.602
So, I am capable of doing
some decent things.

01:20:35.604 --> 01:20:38.805
Uh, I thought it was going to kill me.
But you know how I get

01:20:38.807 --> 01:20:43.178
in party-planning mode. I get
all Laurette-like. I'm sorry.

01:20:46.082 --> 01:20:47.484
I'm crazy.

01:20:48.516 --> 01:20:50.153
I know.

01:20:52.187 --> 01:20:55.121
Um...

01:20:55.123 --> 01:20:58.260
you should bring Freda
to dinner.

01:20:59.328 --> 01:21:00.696
Some night.

01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:04.163
Is that an actual invitation?

01:21:04.165 --> 01:21:06.233
You're actually inviting
Freda to dinner?

01:21:06.235 --> 01:21:08.602
- In your home?
- Come on, Early.

01:21:08.604 --> 01:21:11.540
- I just... I wasn't sure.
- Sure about what?

01:21:13.842 --> 01:21:16.178
I don't...

01:21:19.647 --> 01:21:23.850
I don't know a lot of things...

01:21:23.852 --> 01:21:26.185
but...

01:21:26.187 --> 01:21:30.256
from the day I met Mary
to this very day...

01:21:30.258 --> 01:21:33.796
I know what it means
to love someone.

01:21:35.663 --> 01:21:37.566
That's the only thing I know.

01:21:39.467 --> 01:21:40.702
You're in love?

01:21:43.571 --> 01:21:46.473
Well, then, you're right.

01:21:46.475 --> 01:21:49.609
Early, that much you do know.

01:21:49.611 --> 01:21:51.444
All your life.

01:21:51.446 --> 01:21:53.714
<i>♪ How can you mend ♪</i>

01:21:53.716 --> 01:21:57.751
<i>♪ A broken heart ♪</i>

01:22:11.833 --> 01:22:14.568
I trust you, Early.
I'm just scared.

01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:22.910
That is the saddest thing
I have ever heard in my life.

01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:24.545
This place is so depressing.

01:22:26.649 --> 01:22:28.450
I'm sorry. It is.

01:23:01.283 --> 01:23:03.916
Stop tapping on my wall, Early!

01:23:03.918 --> 01:23:05.618
I can't hear you.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.322
Come over for a cocktail.

01:23:13.861 --> 01:23:15.562
Why were you
knocking on my wall?

01:23:15.564 --> 01:23:17.831
Well, I did it once before,
remember?

01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:20.367
- No.
- You'd had a fight and you were crying,

01:23:20.369 --> 01:23:22.536
and I tapped
on the balcony wall.

01:23:22.538 --> 01:23:25.671
I must have been fucked up.

01:23:25.673 --> 01:23:27.541
Anyway, I've been
in San Francisco.

01:23:27.543 --> 01:23:30.376
- Doing what?
- Living!

01:23:30.378 --> 01:23:32.645
San Francisco is free.

01:23:32.647 --> 01:23:36.950
No bourgeois judgment.

01:23:36.952 --> 01:23:39.819
I can walk down the street
and people get me there.

01:23:39.821 --> 01:23:42.859
They don't freak out
and run away.

01:23:44.325 --> 01:23:46.863
Speaking of San Francisco...

01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:51.501
I brought you this.

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:53.834
That's...

01:23:53.836 --> 01:23:55.335
That's great.

01:23:55.337 --> 01:23:57.504
- It's the Golden Gate.
- I know.

01:23:57.506 --> 01:23:59.372
The labia of America.

01:23:59.374 --> 01:24:03.309
- The labia?
- Yeah, to get to the vagina, America,

01:24:03.311 --> 01:24:06.313
you have to pass through
the labia, the Golden Gate.

01:24:06.315 --> 01:24:08.615
I'll have to take
your word for it.

01:24:08.617 --> 01:24:12.585
Oh, never mind, Early!
It's just a big opening to me.

01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:14.453
But I probably got
the metaphor wrong.

01:24:14.455 --> 01:24:16.456
No, no, it works.
No. No.

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:18.591
It's just symbolic
of something, okay!

01:24:18.593 --> 01:24:21.631
It is. It's a labia
type structure.

01:24:23.332 --> 01:24:24.598
What, um...

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.768
What were you doing
in San Francisco?

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.571
Just wandered around the city.

01:24:31.573 --> 01:24:33.409
Looking hot.

01:24:36.912 --> 01:24:39.414
I thought about calling you.

01:24:41.482 --> 01:24:44.318
I wish you would have.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.621
I've been sitting here trying
to figure things out.

01:24:47.623 --> 01:24:49.855
What were your trying
to figure out, Early?

01:24:49.857 --> 01:24:52.725
I, uh...

01:24:52.727 --> 01:24:56.265
made a list of what I am.

01:24:56.864 --> 01:24:58.900
Let me see this.

01:25:01.436 --> 01:25:05.604
"Southerner." Well there's
nothing we can do about that.

01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:08.075
"Heart attack candidate."
Yeah.

01:25:08.077 --> 01:25:10.710
Too much fried chicken.
You eat like a child.

01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:12.778
Tragic flaw.

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:17.451
"Lover of animals."
A hamster is a rat.

01:25:17.453 --> 01:25:20.120
"Uptight whitey." Yes.

01:25:20.122 --> 01:25:22.355
"Charitable."

01:25:22.357 --> 01:25:26.561
Yes, charitable.
But why, that's the question.

01:25:28.364 --> 01:25:30.400
"Sensual?"

01:25:31.766 --> 01:25:34.436
I think so.

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:38.373
How could one possibly know?

01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:42.345
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.415
Why the question mark?

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:50.352
Because, uh...

01:25:51.954 --> 01:25:55.087
I don't know what I need
to be to be with you,

01:25:55.089 --> 01:25:59.861
and what I am doesn't seem
to include you, so...

01:26:00.796 --> 01:26:02.798
the heck with it.

01:26:05.934 --> 01:26:08.402
Early?

01:26:08.404 --> 01:26:13.572
People in Crane would think
that my life is made up.

01:26:13.574 --> 01:26:15.108
You can't take me to
a dinner party

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:19.078
in El Segundo
for that matter.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.883
I like this part of town.

01:26:24.052 --> 01:26:26.719
I've been a sex worker.

01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:28.788
What did I say?

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.956
I've been a sex worker.

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:32.992
- Red is green.
- Red is green.

01:26:32.994 --> 01:26:34.760
- Blue is orange.
- Blue is orange.

01:26:34.762 --> 01:26:36.862
The sun comes up
in the fucking west.

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:38.197
The sun comes up...

01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:40.736
You will leave me one day.

01:26:42.671 --> 01:26:45.671
You will leave me...

01:26:45.673 --> 01:26:47.377
one day.

01:26:50.512 --> 01:26:54.514
This is some
weird fucking dream.

01:26:54.516 --> 01:26:57.184
Is it?

01:26:57.186 --> 01:26:58.785
When I was laying in the tub

01:26:58.787 --> 01:27:01.020
with my wrists slit open...

01:27:01.022 --> 01:27:03.689
the water turned
this rich burgundy.

01:27:03.691 --> 01:27:07.827
I remember liking that color
for the water.

01:27:07.829 --> 01:27:12.599
And then the light
turned just...

01:27:12.601 --> 01:27:15.535
soft lavender.

01:27:15.537 --> 01:27:17.871
And I liked that too.

01:27:17.873 --> 01:27:21.675
Colors seemed
more appropriate.

01:27:21.677 --> 01:27:23.977
And anyway...

01:27:23.979 --> 01:27:27.848
that's what color they were.

01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:32.018
So, who am I
to quibble with reality.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.019
It's not fucking poetry!

01:27:34.021 --> 01:27:36.022
Why not?

01:27:36.024 --> 01:27:38.828
Lists don't seem to work
in our situation.

01:27:41.696 --> 01:27:43.699
I don't trust you.

01:27:46.267 --> 01:27:49.502
Would you like
a bowl of chicken soup?

01:27:49.504 --> 01:27:51.207
I could heat one up for you.

01:27:52.874 --> 01:27:55.274
Is it fucking lavender
or rich burgundy?

01:27:55.276 --> 01:27:57.980
It's just good soup, Freda.

01:28:02.851 --> 01:28:04.454
I missed you.

01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:10.689
All your creepy warmth.

01:28:10.691 --> 01:28:12.526
I missed that.

01:28:12.528 --> 01:28:18.568
You're like... a portable
pot-bellied stove with...

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.800
insinuating eyes.

01:28:21.802 --> 01:28:24.140
Poetry.

01:28:28.577 --> 01:28:31.044
I'll have a small bowl.

01:28:31.046 --> 01:28:32.481
Fuck!

01:28:50.832 --> 01:28:52.935
I love you.

01:29:07.114 --> 01:29:08.717
So, um...

01:29:11.285 --> 01:29:13.756
It's easy, Early.

01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:17.791
And fun.

01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:19.792
Well...

01:29:19.794 --> 01:29:21.931
as long as it's fun.

01:29:24.065 --> 01:29:25.999
Early?

01:29:26.001 --> 01:29:27.770
Freda?

01:29:31.272 --> 01:29:33.275
You promise me something.

01:29:37.913 --> 01:29:39.649
Anything.

01:29:45.575 --> 01:29:48.822
