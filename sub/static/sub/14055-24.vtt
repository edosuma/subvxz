WEBVTT

00:00.709 --> 00:01.877
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.960 --> 00:04.713
You were in Miami.
Marissa and I, we got drunk together.

00:04.713 --> 00:05.589
And you came on to her.

00:05.589 --> 00:06.465
She threw herself at me.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.383
- What am I supposed to think?
- I didn't hook up with him.

00:08.383 --> 00:11.428
- I am a good mother.
- You're also an alcoholic.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.598
I may like my Chardonnay,
but I am not going to die alone,

00:14.598 --> 00:16.517
and that's more than  I can say for you!

00:16.517 --> 00:17.726
Cal!

00:17.851 --> 00:20.812
- What is it?
- It's about your father. He's dead.

00:23.899 --> 00:28.111
I can meet you right away.
I want to.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.073
I have a funeral to go to in a couple of
hours, so I got to keep it brief, but...

00:32.783 --> 00:36.537
.... the sooner the better.
Thank you.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.133
- Everything okay?
- Been better.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.470
- Sorry about everything.
- That's okay, sweetie.

00:53.971 --> 00:57.224
- He loved you very much.
- Yeah. I'm going to miss him.

00:58.100 --> 00:58.725
Need anything?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.520
No. I'm just looking for my cell phone
charger. My battery's dead.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.022
There might be a charger in your
dad's office. I'm going to get ready.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.107
All right.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.843
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.886
How you doing?

01:34.011 --> 01:37.347
Well, I was depressed.
Now I'm depressed and confused.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.891
It's a rehab center.
Where did you get this?

01:38.891 --> 01:43.187
My dad's office. I don't think he's
trying to kick bagels.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.481
I don't think it's for your dad.

02:23.817 --> 02:26.528
Why don't you tell me a little more
about your wife-- about her history.

02:26.612 --> 02:29.406
Yeah, well, Kirsten's always enjoyed
a glass of wine or two.

02:29.698 --> 02:32.868
But, in the last few months,
it's changed-- she's changed.

02:32.993 --> 02:36.413
- Changed how?
- Well, she switched to vodka, for starters.

02:36.997 --> 02:38.791
Last week, she had a car accident.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.711
And now I'm afraid, with the loss of her
father, things are going to get worse.

02:42.836 --> 02:45.297
I assume you'd want her to have
a residential treatment.

02:45.464 --> 02:50.677
As you can see, we provide a confidential
and peaceful environment for recovery.

02:52.846 --> 02:55.724
You know, Doctor, I... I might
be overreacting.

02:55.724 --> 02:57.518
I know how hard it is to accept.

02:57.518 --> 03:01.563
We all want to think we can get someone
we love through something like this.

03:05.109 --> 03:06.985
She's not going to come voluntarily.

03:07.319 --> 03:09.905
Very few of our patients
check themselves in.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.630
I'm getting ready.

03:27.089 --> 03:31.218
Hey. All my black dresses look like they
should be accessorized with a broomstick.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.469
Do you have anything I can borrow?

03:32.594 --> 03:34.805
It's a funeral, Mom, not a fashion show.

03:36.765 --> 03:39.518
Sorry. Um... look, let me see
what I've got, okay?

03:39.518 --> 03:41.311
- Wait. I can do it.
- No.

03:41.311 --> 03:45.482
You've been through more than enough.
I didn't mean to be a bitch.

03:45.774 --> 03:47.776
Apples and trees. You are my daughter.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.904
Which means I must have something
that'll look great on you.

04:00.831 --> 04:02.583
- Dad.
- Hey, kiddo.

04:07.421 --> 04:11.383
- Hey, Jules.
- Jimmy. What are you doing here?

04:11.467 --> 04:14.219
You didn't think I'd leave you
two alone during all this, did you?

04:17.346 --> 04:22.853
Oh, I can see how you might,
but I'm... I'm so sorry. I really am.

04:23.020 --> 04:26.607
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah. Really good.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.321
Well, I'm sure it's been a hard week
but, uh... we'll get through it.

04:43.373 --> 04:45.542
- Hey, sis.
- Hi.

04:47.252 --> 04:49.004
Oh, it's so good to see you.

04:50.380 --> 04:54.093
He said his heart thing was no big deal.
Not worth flying home for.

04:54.426 --> 04:57.721
He didn't want to worry you.
You were his little girl.

04:57.805 --> 04:58.764
I know.

04:59.181 --> 05:02.518
After all these years, I caused him
nothing but stress and anxiety.

05:02.893 --> 05:05.938
Nothing made him more proud
than seeing you get your life together.

05:06.355 --> 05:10.734
Me? Last time I saw him, I told him
he was going to die alone.

05:20.452 --> 05:22.454
- Hi.
- Hey, Cohen.

05:22.704 --> 05:26.416
Captain Oats around?
I brought him some company.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.377
Princess Sparkle, you're in my room.

05:28.377 --> 05:30.671
Yeah. I figured Oats
would be pretty down--

05:30.754 --> 05:34.258
could use the companionship of someone
sweet and pretty, with shinier hair.

05:34.466 --> 05:37.386
That would just, you know,
be there for him.

05:37.469 --> 05:40.097
Yeah. Well, the captain's pretty lucky.

05:40.222 --> 05:43.559
Yeah, well, if he gets fresh with her,
it's straight to the glue factory.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.145
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:47.396 --> 05:49.481
I know you and your grandpa were close.

05:49.940 --> 05:52.067
It's actually my mom
that I'm worried about.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.735
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

05:54.695 --> 05:57.531
This morning, I was in my dad's office,
and I found a, uh...

05:57.531 --> 05:59.741
.... like a brochure for rehab.

06:00.033 --> 06:01.201
Oh, my God.

06:01.618 --> 06:02.995
Has she been drinking a lot?

06:02.995 --> 06:07.624
Well, I mean, she's a WASP, living in
Orange County, so it's all relative, right?

06:07.916 --> 06:11.628
I don't know. She has a glass
of wine at dinner-- maybe two.

06:11.837 --> 06:12.963
Any more than that?

06:12.963 --> 06:16.717
That's the thing. I've been so self-involved
this past year, I don't even know.

06:16.717 --> 06:18.302
I have no idea.

06:18.427 --> 06:21.805
I'm sure it's, you know,
at least partially my fault.

06:21.805 --> 06:24.683
I know running away was really
hard on her last summer, and...

06:24.892 --> 06:28.103
Cohen, no offense, but you're
being self-involved again.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.356
I think this is bigger than you.

06:36.278 --> 06:39.198
I should go put on my tie.
It always takes me a few tries.

06:40.657 --> 06:42.117
Yeah.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.501
I didn't think you got up this early.

06:51.251 --> 06:54.880
Maybe I haven't been to sleep yet.
Something's come up.

06:56.173 --> 06:58.550
- What's going on?
- It's graduation time.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.219
which always means big business.

07:00.886 --> 07:03.847
Got a call from a couple of kids
who basically supply Garden Grove.

07:07.101 --> 07:10.145
- I'm real happy for you.
- For us.

07:10.312 --> 07:14.525
It's going to be huge-- like, 15 grand.
I'll give you half.

07:16.902 --> 07:19.822
- And why would you do that?
- 'Cause I need your help.

07:25.285 --> 07:28.038
-  Where the hell did you get that?
- Do you know how to use it?

07:31.291 --> 07:33.085
I'm not, like, a sniper or anything.

07:33.168 --> 07:35.379
Can you point it at somebody
like you mean it?

07:37.798 --> 07:39.258
Then you get half.

07:40.300 --> 07:47.349
Now... I definitely...
need to get some sleep.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.279
We are gathered here today to pay
our last respects to Caleb Nichol.

08:42.863 --> 08:45.240
His loss is felt across
the county-- across the...

08:45.407 --> 08:49.703
Caleb Nichol was not a man of many words.
He was, however, a brilliant man.

08:49.828 --> 08:51.997
He leaves a legacy of possibility.

08:52.414 --> 08:55.459
But his true achievement
were his children.

08:56.126 --> 08:59.630
He  was a caring father.
A wonderful grandfather.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.590
A truly terrible father-in-law.

09:01.673 --> 09:04.176
Thou I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

09:04.384 --> 09:06.011
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

09:06.095 --> 09:11.391
So, he may be gone,
but he won't soon be forgotten.

09:12.476 --> 09:13.852
Rest in peace, Cal.

09:14.394 --> 09:19.358
And if you can't do that,  I'm sure
Heaven could use a few more McMansions.

09:26.037 --> 09:29.540
What are you doing here?
You know, I do work for a living.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.126
Yeah? Well, keep hanging out with me,
and soon you won't have to.

09:32.126 --> 09:33.461
Let me ask you a question.

09:33.919 --> 09:35.421
Why don't you ever worry about,

09:35.504 --> 09:38.633
like, calculus or Mayan history,
like a normal teenager?

09:38.674 --> 09:39.842
Bad parenting.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.638
So, looks like everything's
gonna go down tonight.

09:43.721 --> 09:45.806
- And it's gonna go down here.
- Whoa, whoa. What do you mean here?

09:45.806 --> 09:47.266
I needed someplace public.

09:47.475 --> 09:50.728
The last kid who sold to these guys
ended up with a tire iron upside the head.

09:50.895 --> 09:51.812
Great.

09:51.812 --> 09:55.358
- Look, if you don't want to do it...
- Look, I said I'm gonna do it, and I will.

09:55.441 --> 09:57.401
But after this, I am done.

10:10.289 --> 10:13.542
I figured if I didn't initiate,
you wouldn't talk to me.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.044
Hailey, hey.

10:15.127 --> 10:18.714
No, I'm sorry. I had my hands full
with Julie and Marissa.

10:18.798 --> 10:20.800
So you don't totally hate me
for bailing on you?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.760
People in glass houses, Hail.

10:23.511 --> 10:26.222
- So, you moved to Hawaii. How is it?
- Ah. It's fantastic.

10:26.305 --> 10:28.849
You would not believe the North Shore.

10:28.891 --> 10:30.309
So I've heard.

10:31.269 --> 10:32.812
Thank you for coming.

10:33.729 --> 10:36.649
She's, uh... She's taking it
pretty hard, huh?

10:39.485 --> 10:41.320
I've never seen her like this.

10:57.044 --> 10:59.130
You know, we have bartenders
we're paying to do that.

10:59.255 --> 11:02.258
- I don't like waiting in line.
- No, honey, it's still early.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.012
This thing's gonna be going on for a while.
Maybe you want to pace yourself.

11:06.679 --> 11:08.097
Maybe I don't.

11:08.848 --> 11:13.144
My father just died. Maybe you want to lay
off the Kirsten drink count for a while.

11:14.312 --> 11:18.024
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You're right. I am.

11:23.321 --> 11:26.490
If it would help, I could take over
"Kirsten Watch" for a while.

11:26.532 --> 11:28.200
I don't know if anything's gonna help.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.911
So then let her glower at me.
I'm used to it.

11:31.287 --> 11:35.541
Unfortunately, so am I these days.
Thank you, Julie.

11:44.008 --> 11:46.844
Okay, I have officially talked
to every pillar in the community.

11:46.886 --> 11:47.803
I'm sick of pillars.

11:47.803 --> 11:51.140
At least you don't have everyone asking if you're
the guy that burned down Caleb's model home

11:51.140 --> 11:52.558
and caused him to have
his first heart attack.

11:52.558 --> 11:55.478
Yeah, well, everyone's looking at me
like I'm the grieving stepdaughter.

11:55.603 --> 11:57.063
I don't think the guy could stand me.

11:57.063 --> 12:00.650
Okay, where is Summer?
Is she smoking the salmon herself?

12:01.317 --> 12:02.485
You guys want to hide out
in the pool house?

12:02.485 --> 12:04.236
Oh, so bad.

12:11.243 --> 12:13.454
Hey, Mrs. Cohen.
I thought you might be hungry.

12:13.537 --> 12:14.622
Oh, no thank you, Summer.

12:14.622 --> 12:18.751
Well, if my stepmother taught me anything,
it's to never drink on an empty stomach.

12:19.251 --> 12:20.753
Thanks for the tip.

12:28.302 --> 12:30.096
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Mr. C.

12:30.179 --> 12:32.348
Boy, you really cleaned out
the buffet, huh?

12:32.348 --> 12:35.768
- Well, I have extra if you want any.
- I am powerless before a whitefish.

12:36.310 --> 12:38.187
Hey, could you do me a little favor?

12:38.312 --> 12:40.273
This thing is gonna be going
on for a little while.

12:40.398 --> 12:43.234
And you know Seth's been through a lot
in the last couple of days, and...

12:43.359 --> 12:46.612
it might be a great idea if you could get
him out of the house for a little while.

12:50.157 --> 12:52.910
- Yeah. Sure thing.
- Thanks.

12:58.874 --> 13:00.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:00.251 --> 13:03.004
Um, funeral food is,
like, so depressing.

13:03.004 --> 13:05.339
I thought maybe we could go get
some chili fries and

13:05.464 --> 13:07.133
maybe stop by the Bait Shop
or something?

13:07.133 --> 13:08.342
Good idea.

13:09.969 --> 13:13.139
Hey, Ryan, you don't think
Trey'll be there, do you?

13:13.180 --> 13:16.183
No, he's on day shifts.
Be fine. Promise.

13:35.119 --> 13:39.290
Do I still even work here?
I should find out for tax purposes.

13:43.544 --> 13:44.962
You've got to be kidding me.

13:46.172 --> 13:47.173
Great.

13:50.927 --> 13:52.970
Hey. Man, I'm so sorry
about your grandfather.

13:52.970 --> 13:53.638
Yeah, thanks.

13:53.638 --> 13:55.723
- What are you doing here?
- I came back to pick up a paycheck.

13:55.723 --> 13:57.600
Paychecks are handed out on Mondays.

13:58.392 --> 14:00.019
Even I know that.
I think I've been fired.

14:00.102 --> 14:03.356
Yeah? When was that?

14:05.524 --> 14:06.817
You guys are dressed up.

14:06.817 --> 14:08.945
We just came from, uh,
my grandfather's funeral.

14:09.028 --> 14:11.656
Oh. Well, he was probably pretty old.

14:12.990 --> 14:15.826
Ready, Trey?
Bye, party people.

14:19.622 --> 14:21.415
You guys want to go maybe
grab us some seats?

14:21.499 --> 14:22.416
Yeah, we'll get drinks.

14:22.416 --> 14:24.585
Okay. Come on.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.094
It's bad enough this has to go down at
the place I work at, but with Ryan here?

14:34.512 --> 14:36.555
What, afraid you're gonna look bad
in front of Marissa Cooper?

14:36.555 --> 14:39.725
No, I just think we should go
someplace else-- the pier, whatever.

14:39.850 --> 14:43.271
It's too late. Our friends are already
on their way. Now, is it loaded?

14:49.318 --> 14:52.321
Okay, Coop... you want to tell me what
that was about between you and Trey?

14:52.571 --> 14:53.656
What  are you talking about?

14:53.823 --> 14:57.201
Oh, I don't know, gamma rays of hate
shooting out of your eyeballs.

14:57.410 --> 15:00.955
I mean, problems with Ryan;
a weird tension with Trey.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.041
One girl, two brothers--
it's all a little Legends of the Fall.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.168
Hmm. I never saw that one.

15:06.711 --> 15:07.712
Hi.

15:11.007 --> 15:14.135
I guess if I still worked here,
I could make the drinks myself.

15:14.218 --> 15:15.303
So how are you, man?

15:15.428 --> 15:19.599
Not good, my head's all over the place. I
still haven't had a chance to talk to my dad.

15:19.765 --> 15:23.811
Hey... Two Yoo-hoos and a couple
of smoothie chasers, please.

15:34.822 --> 15:38.159
And what about you?
I mean, how's work, how's the family?

15:38.492 --> 15:41.245
Well, actually, not so good.

15:41.829 --> 15:45.333
You know, you left, boy, just before
things got really crazy.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.418
Yeah, well, that was the idea, I guess.

15:47.418 --> 15:50.838
Sandy... I need your help.

15:54.383 --> 15:55.676
Excuse me.

16:02.016 --> 16:04.268
Oh, for God's sake, Kirsten,
at least use a glass.

16:04.393 --> 16:06.437
Oh, for God's sake, Sandy,
just leave me alone.

16:06.562 --> 16:10.024
It's been a long day, and I bet
you could probably use a little sleep.

16:10.024 --> 16:12.777
- I feel okay.
- Come on, let's just go to bed.

16:12.777 --> 16:14.987
Get your hands off me!

16:21.869 --> 16:23.120
Are you happy?

16:27.166 --> 16:29.627
- Kirsten...
- I'm okay.

16:31.170 --> 16:32.713
Jimmy, I'm okay.

16:49.146 --> 16:54.193
You got the money?
Have your taste, then we're all good.

17:01.659 --> 17:04.078
The speed here in the bag, same quality.

17:05.162 --> 17:07.330
Actually, we don't have
enough to cover the coke.

17:07.580 --> 17:10.417
How 'bout we set up a payment plan, like
we plan to pay you when we feel like it.

17:10.417 --> 17:13.796
- Yo, what's up? We had a deal!
- We're renegotiating, Garden Grove-style.

17:13.878 --> 17:16.674
What are you gonna do about it,
you little Newport bi-atch?

17:19.885 --> 17:21.220
Who's the bitch now, huh?

17:21.220 --> 17:22.762
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Jess?

17:22.762 --> 17:25.849
Give me my money,
get in your rice rocket, and drive away.

17:25.849 --> 17:27.685
You're gonna have to shoot me.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.823
Get down!

17:46.871 --> 17:48.080
Is everybody okay?

17:48.080 --> 17:50.833
Marissa?! Oh, my gosh!

17:51.917 --> 17:53.419
Just broken glass.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.645
Where is she?

18:12.562 --> 18:14.231
Sleeping it off.

18:15.482 --> 18:18.902
- How long has this been going on?
- Too long.

18:20.904 --> 18:22.822
You know, last night sealed the deal.

18:23.073 --> 18:25.617
She's getting help
whether she wants it or not.

18:27.494 --> 18:29.955
Speaking of help...
how can I?

18:31.623 --> 18:36.753
Well, I'm gonna need to talk to the boys
privately. I, I don't know what they know.

18:36.962 --> 18:40.048
I could get her out of the house.
Maybe a day at the spa.

18:40.632 --> 18:43.260
- Thanks, Hail.
- Yeah.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.934
- Hey.
- Had a feeling I'd see you.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.645
- Can I, uh, can I come in?
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:54.020 --> 18:55.605
You want something to drink,
like, water, I guess?

18:55.605 --> 18:57.107
What happened last night?

19:00.026 --> 19:03.154
I was helping Jess out, and it got
a little out of control, man.

19:03.238 --> 19:04.865
Story of your life, right?

19:05.323 --> 19:08.410
Yeah, but that was it, man.
I told her I'm done.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.370
Done. Heard that before, too.

19:10.579 --> 19:13.498
Dude, I know, but Jess turned out
to be a little crazier than I expected.

19:13.498 --> 19:16.001
Really? That's a surprise, considering
you met her face- down in a pool.

19:16.001 --> 19:18.545
I screwed up, Ryan. I know that.
What do you want me to say?

19:18.545 --> 19:20.171
I don't want you to say anything...

19:21.464 --> 19:24.176
Anymore. We gave it a shot.
We tried to make it work.

19:24.259 --> 19:27.512
- I... swear to God, Ryan.
- I want you out of Newport.

19:27.596 --> 19:33.268
Come on, man. We're brothers.
We're blood.

19:34.227 --> 19:36.021
Ryan, granted, I got a little
more of Dad's bad luck.

19:36.021 --> 19:37.522
You got to go, Trey.

19:46.865 --> 19:50.577
Okay. I'll be gone first
thing in the morning.

20:08.970 --> 20:11.264
I figured you hadn't learned
how to brew coffee yet.

20:12.015 --> 20:16.019
Okay. Marrying Caleb didn't exactly
turn me into a domestic goddess.

20:16.269 --> 20:20.398
And I brought your favorite
powdered-sugar doughnuts from 7-Eleven.

20:20.482 --> 20:21.942
Thank you.

20:23.109 --> 20:24.444
So, listen--

20:24.694 --> 20:28.865
I was hoping you, me, Marissa take
the boat out, sail to Catalina today.

20:29.491 --> 20:33.578
Oh, well, except Marissa won't be up
till close to sundown, so, hmm.

20:33.703 --> 20:37.541
Well, then, uh, how about you and I go?
You and me.

20:37.707 --> 20:42.254
Grab some lobsters-- dead ones,
of course-- hang out, have lunch.

20:42.796 --> 20:46.007
Wow. We haven't done that in,
like, a million years.

20:46.216 --> 20:47.968
Since before we were married.

20:50.679 --> 20:53.098
Okay. I'll write Marissa a note.

20:58.353 --> 20:59.312
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:59.437 --> 21:02.357
- Just making some cereal. You want some?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

21:02.357 --> 21:05.402
Boy, we got a lot of leftovers, and the
food is still arriving by the truckload.

21:05.527 --> 21:08.280
Yeah, it's the silver
lining of any funeral.

21:10.574 --> 21:12.200
- How's Mom? Is she up yet?
- Yeah.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.995
She's spending the day at a spa
with Hailey, getting a little R&R.

21:14.995 --> 21:17.455
Well, that's good.
She could use a day to relax.

21:18.498 --> 21:22.794
She hasn't really been
too, uh, Mom-esque lately.

21:23.253 --> 21:27.007
Well, that's true.
She's suffering right now.

21:27.090 --> 21:29.926
Well, she was really
close to Grandpa, so...

21:30.051 --> 21:31.970
Oh, it's bigger than that, Seth.

21:35.599 --> 21:40.478
Your mother has a drinking problem.
She needs help.

21:41.521 --> 21:47.611
Oh. You mean like that rehab brochure
I found, you just forgot to mention.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.908
I've been waiting for the right time, and...
I'd been hoping I could do this myself.

21:53.033 --> 21:57.621
Maybe we can. So she's drinking. We ask her
to stop. We don't have to send her away.

21:58.413 --> 22:01.750
She can't stop. She's tried.

22:07.839 --> 22:09.883
There's a doctor
coming here this afternoon.

22:11.343 --> 22:15.472
- He's gonna help us stage an intervention.
- What?! Wha...

22:15.639 --> 22:17.599
Is this is like an after-school special?

22:18.058 --> 22:21.019
Her dad died. She's sad.
She's having a few drinks.

22:21.019 --> 22:23.313
This has been going on for a long time.

22:23.522 --> 22:25.482
- The car accident she had?
- Yeah?

22:25.815 --> 22:30.153
- Did you know she had been drinking?
- No, I didn't, because you never told me.

22:30.445 --> 22:33.573
You  never told me anything until right now,
and you expect me to help you ship her off.

22:33.573 --> 22:34.491
We're trying to help her.

22:34.491 --> 22:37.285
You know, how do I know
you didn't cause her to drink?

22:37.285 --> 22:39.162
Something weird's been going on
between you two all year.

22:39.162 --> 22:41.039
I get that you're upset. I'm upset, too.

22:41.039 --> 22:43.750
Okay, well, if your way of showing
that you're upset is shipping her off

22:43.750 --> 22:46.169
so you don't have to deal with her, that's
fine-- I'm just not gonna be a part of it.

22:46.169 --> 22:48.129
You are a part of it,
whether you want to be or not.

22:48.213 --> 22:53.426
You want to run away again? Get in your
boat and sail away? Your mother needs you.

22:55.554 --> 22:57.764
- Come on in, Ryan. You should hear this.
- Yeah.

22:57.848 --> 23:00.559
Apparently Mom's a drunk and
today's the intervention, so,

23:00.767 --> 23:02.644
plan your afternoon accordingly.

23:05.438 --> 23:08.859
If you want, I can talk to him, tell him
you're doing the right thing, 'cause you are.

23:09.067 --> 23:12.696
Thanks. But that's my job.

23:20.078 --> 23:21.413
Come in.

23:21.705 --> 23:24.124
Hey. How is your head?

23:24.165 --> 23:27.002
Um... okay. It's just a scratch.

23:27.085 --> 23:31.339
Well, I was thinking, after the past few
days you've had, some pancakes on the pier

23:31.339 --> 23:34.551
and some serioussunbathing could be
just what the doctor ordered.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.261
That is, if I had a Ph.D.

23:36.261 --> 23:37.846
Yeah, well, you don't
have to take care of me.

23:37.846 --> 23:40.765
Are you kidding? After that scene
from Scarface we just lived through?

23:40.891 --> 23:45.228
- I could use a short stack stat.
- All right, well, I appreciate it.

23:45.937 --> 23:48.315
Good. So we'll go.

23:49.107 --> 23:51.568
Just as soon as you
tell me what's going on.

23:51.860 --> 23:52.986
Huh?

23:53.403 --> 23:56.239
The weird bruise on your neck
and a bad excuse from you.

23:56.364 --> 23:59.910
Weird tension with Trey, and then you
don't even bother to make up an excuse.

24:00.285 --> 24:02.162
Marissa, please don't lie to me.

24:02.245 --> 24:04.915
I'm your best friend,
and I know something happened.

24:05.665 --> 24:08.168
Please, just tell me what's going on.

24:11.963 --> 24:13.423
Coop?

24:16.092 --> 24:17.636
Coop?

24:19.095 --> 24:21.264
Oh, sweetie.

24:38.865 --> 24:40.659
Maybe I should have told you earlier.

24:41.535 --> 24:42.911
I don't know.

24:43.995 --> 24:46.331
They left that chapter
out of the manual.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.335
How long would she go away for?

24:52.212 --> 24:56.550
Well, as long as it takes.
Months, maybe.

24:57.717 --> 25:03.849
This isn't... This isn't supposed
to happen to us. We're not that family.

25:03.974 --> 25:08.061
Every family's got their issues.
This is ours.

25:10.689 --> 25:14.234
I just don't think I can do it.
Not to Mom.

25:14.860 --> 25:16.361
I get it.

25:19.489 --> 25:21.324
That's the doctor from the clinic.

25:22.742 --> 25:26.538
- We'll be downstairs.
- I'm sorry.

25:41.428 --> 25:43.388
- How are you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

25:43.513 --> 25:47.017
It was just what I needed.
That deep-tissue massage worked miracles.

25:47.017 --> 25:48.560
That's good.

25:48.727 --> 25:51.188
We should call the house and see
if they want us to pick up any food.

25:51.271 --> 25:54.858
We should probably just go home.
You know, there's a lot of leftovers.

26:07.454 --> 26:09.497
Hello! Anyone home?

26:09.539 --> 26:11.333
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

26:11.458 --> 26:14.211
Why don't you come into the kitchen.
I need to talk to you.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.087
You're acting awfully mysterious.

26:20.050 --> 26:24.054
- Oh. I didn't know we had company.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Kenneth Woodruff.

26:24.221 --> 26:28.141
I'm a counselor at the Suriak Drug and
Alcohol Abuse Rehabilitation Center.

26:28.934 --> 26:31.853
Uh, okay. Does someone
want to tell me what's going on?

26:31.895 --> 26:35.315
Your family requested that I be here
today to help them lead an intervention.

26:36.149 --> 26:37.859
Uh, what for? Why?

26:37.859 --> 26:42.239
We are all here because we are worried
that, uh, you have an addiction to alcohol.

26:42.572 --> 26:45.534
Each person here wants
to share their concern for you.

26:45.784 --> 26:48.578
Well, that's very nice of
everybody, but not necessary.

26:48.662 --> 26:50.622
Sandy, you go first?

26:52.374 --> 26:56.503
I'm so sorry, honey.
How hard this must be for you to hear.

26:59.798 --> 27:03.552
- I don't want you to hurt yourself anymore.
- Sandy, don't you think you're overreacting?

27:03.718 --> 27:05.720
I mean, everybody's overreacting.

27:05.887 --> 27:08.348
Hailey? Please. Now you.

27:08.849 --> 27:12.352
Keeks. You know our history.

27:12.561 --> 27:15.814
You know Mom battled it, and you know if
it was me, you'd be doing the same thing.

27:15.814 --> 27:17.190
I don't know that.

27:17.482 --> 27:20.318
All the time you were partying
and doing drugs,

27:20.360 --> 27:23.572
I just encouraged you to make
better choices. I didn't lock you up.

27:23.697 --> 27:24.906
Ryan.

27:28.326 --> 27:30.871
Oh, don't you say a word.
I let you into this house.

27:31.037 --> 27:34.332
Yeah, you did, because my own mom
couldn't take care of me,

27:34.416 --> 27:37.085
because she wouldn't get help,
even though I asked her to.

27:39.004 --> 27:41.715
I don't want to see that happen
again to someone I love.

27:48.471 --> 27:51.057
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here...

27:51.975 --> 27:54.978
...but I am not going.

27:59.232 --> 28:01.776
Mom, please, you got to do this.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.994
Aren't you glad you got to
come back for all this fun?

28:41.870 --> 28:44.331
Actually... I am.

28:47.751 --> 28:49.586
I'll put the bag in the car.

28:50.670 --> 28:52.589
I'll see you soon, sis.

29:00.514 --> 29:03.892
I'm so sorry that I put
you both through this.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.228
- Just get better.
- I will.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.979
You gonna be okay?

29:08.897 --> 29:14.111
Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about Dad.
We'll set up a stage in the living room.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.364
Give him a microphone
and the music to Starlight Express.

29:17.447 --> 29:19.157
I got the take-out menus covered.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.577
- I'll order. I'm good with the phone.
- We'll be fine, really.

29:23.703 --> 29:26.081
I love you both so much.

30:05.829 --> 30:08.623
All right, come on.
You and me, rematch.

30:11.209 --> 30:15.213
Well, James, other than those
disgusting mussels you made me eat...

30:15.338 --> 30:17.048
...this was actually pretty fun.

30:17.174 --> 30:19.134
Well, you're entitled to a little fun.

30:19.217 --> 30:22.888
Oh, it's just... I feel so guilty.

30:23.013 --> 30:25.807
About what, smiling the day
after your husband's funeral?

30:27.017 --> 30:30.187
I mean, let's face it.
That marriage wasn't exactly...

30:30.270 --> 30:31.813
What we had.

30:33.148 --> 30:34.649
Nothing ever will be.

30:37.277 --> 30:41.740
What if I decided to stay? What if,
you know, we gave it another shot?

30:42.073 --> 30:44.618
We're both older and wiser now.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.536
Well, I'm certainly wiser.

30:56.338 --> 30:57.589
Going somewhere?

31:00.634 --> 31:02.844
I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm going.

31:02.844 --> 31:05.847
- We could take off together.
- Yeah, Jess? And where would we go?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.018
Vegas.

31:12.687 --> 31:14.356
You a gambler, Trey?

31:15.649 --> 31:17.275
I hooked up with you.

31:19.444 --> 31:23.365
I'm gonna go home and pack,
steal my stepdad's Beemer...

31:24.157 --> 31:25.784
And I'll be back at 8:00.

31:38.588 --> 31:40.757
This whole floating in the pool thing
is not really helping.

31:40.841 --> 31:42.134
Yeah, I hear you.

31:42.217 --> 31:45.303
Neither are those video games
or the wisdom of Chuck Klosterman.

31:45.929 --> 31:47.848
You know what?
We should get out of the house.

31:49.057 --> 31:51.810
Hit up an old age home.
Some shuffleboard action.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.062
I'm not really in the mood
for old people.

31:54.729 --> 31:57.065
IMAX movie? Something with sharks, huh?

31:57.274 --> 31:58.859
All right. I like sharks.

32:02.404 --> 32:04.823
The way things have been going,
I'd bet that's Oliver.

32:06.783 --> 32:07.576
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:07.576 --> 32:09.870
Can I talk to you... alone?

32:16.001 --> 32:18.253
- What's going on? Everything okay?
- No.

32:19.296 --> 32:23.467
Look, I'm really sorry to pile on
in terms of, like, the worst news ever.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.927
Hey. It's okay.
What's the matter?

32:27.637 --> 32:30.474
When you and Ryan were in Miami,
Trey and Marissa...

32:31.391 --> 32:32.684
Yeah...?

32:33.643 --> 32:35.479
He attacked her, Seth.

32:37.564 --> 32:40.650
- What do you mean?
- He forced himself on her. He tried to...

32:42.861 --> 32:47.699
But she didn't tell Ryan because, you know,
he's Ryan, and who knows what he would do.

32:48.408 --> 32:50.410
- Well, he has to know.
- You think?

32:50.410 --> 32:53.371
Yeah, look, if last night wasn't
proof enough, Trey's crazy.

32:53.497 --> 32:55.916
What if he attacks you next?
I can't not tell him.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.960
How are you gonna tell him?

33:06.051 --> 33:07.219
Welcome.

33:07.803 --> 33:11.556
I'll show you to your room, but first,
I need to check your bag, Kirsten.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.600
Uh, it's standard procedure.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.031
Oh, it's a good-size bed.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.703
Oh, nice sheets. High thread count.

33:34.871 --> 33:38.625
Nice TV. Lot of channels. I'll bet you
get a lot of reading done here.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.043
Yeah.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.464
Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen, we're having
a meeting for new guests.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.592
What time is the meeting over? I just want
to make sure I'm home when you call.

33:47.592 --> 33:51.638
Actually, uh, she won't be able to make
any phone calls for 72 hours.

33:52.848 --> 33:55.016
- It's detox.
- Oh.

33:57.060 --> 33:59.896
- Could you give us just a minute?
- Yeah.

34:09.989 --> 34:12.159
I'm so sorry, Sandy.

34:15.078 --> 34:18.290
What I said to you, put you through.

34:19.416 --> 34:23.837
And we can bend this thing.
Doesn't mean it's gonna break.

34:49.946 --> 34:51.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.159
We should probably go.
IMAX movies have previews.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.995
Uh, maybe we should
skip the movie, actually.

34:58.872 --> 35:02.125
Do you want to sit down maybe?
Or stand up, or whatever?

35:02.125 --> 35:03.293
What's going on?

35:04.920 --> 35:08.465
Uh, my-my dad just called. Uh...

35:08.673 --> 35:11.426
said my mom just landed at the place.
It's really beautiful, and...

35:11.426 --> 35:12.260
That's good, man.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.846
Yeah, but also something more.

35:15.222 --> 35:18.767
But before I tell you, you got
to promise you're gonna stay calm,

35:18.767 --> 35:21.561
you're not gonna get all
old-school Ryan Atwood.

35:22.562 --> 35:23.688
What is it?

35:23.980 --> 35:26.233
- Well, it's upsetting.
- Yeah, we covered that.

35:26.775 --> 35:31.738
So, I know what happened with Trey
and Marissa, like, what really happened.

35:33.657 --> 35:34.866
What do you mean?

35:36.868 --> 35:39.454
I guess, while we were away,
he sort of, like,

35:39.454 --> 35:42.707
attacked her or something,
kind of forced himself on her.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.585
I mean, nothing happened.
She fought him off, but it's...

35:45.710 --> 35:47.712
it's why he's got
the cut on his head.

36:02.978 --> 36:06.982
All year, I have tried to be
a different person.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.742
I can't do that anymore.

36:17.826 --> 36:19.995
Wait, Ryan, what are you gonna do?

36:23.373 --> 36:28.253
I'm gonna settle this with Trey.
Once and for all.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.306
What are you guys doing?

36:39.514 --> 36:43.018
Oh, well, we thought
we'd have dinner as a family.

36:43.477 --> 36:47.439
- Okay.
- And, uh, breakfast.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.192
Uh-huh. What's going on here?

36:51.067 --> 36:53.862
Well, your father's going
to stay with us

36:53.945 --> 36:57.407
while we get settled,
and then maybe after that.

36:59.326 --> 37:00.952
If that's okay with you.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.913
And with Kaitlin coming home
from boarding school this summer,

37:02.913 --> 37:05.874
we were talking about
taking a family trip, maybe.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.835
Again, if that's okay with you.

37:13.590 --> 37:15.634
Anything to have you back, Dad.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.011
Thanks, kiddo.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.113
I'd really love for us
to be a family again.

37:41.159 --> 37:45.080
The Coopers making a comeback.
Who'd have thunk it?

37:45.413 --> 37:47.499
Oh, sorry, one sec.

37:47.749 --> 37:50.961
- Hey, can I call you back?
- Actually, no. There's a problem.

37:51.294 --> 37:52.003
What's going on?

37:52.003 --> 37:54.923
Well, we're on our way to Trey's, but
you're closer. Maybe you can stop him.

37:55.048 --> 37:57.384
- What are you talking about?
- Ryan knows.

38:36.756 --> 38:38.425
- Hey, Ry...
- I know what happened.

38:40.093 --> 38:41.970
I know what happened
with you and Marissa.

38:44.931 --> 38:48.560
How could you, man? I would
have done anything for you.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.604
Man, I was messed up. I was stoned.

38:50.604 --> 38:52.856
It wasn't my idea, Trey.
I didn't want to steal that car.

38:52.856 --> 38:56.026
Yeah, well, hey, man, I went away for it,
and, uh, you got the good life.

38:56.026 --> 38:58.153
So you had to destroy it?
You had to hurt her, huh?!

38:58.153 --> 39:00.655
No, no!
Hey, okay, okay.

39:00.906 --> 39:04.242
Listen, man, we're gonna calm down, and
we're gonna calm down right now, okay?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.286
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

39:08.705 --> 39:13.043
- Is that how this ends?
- No, how this ends is up to you...

39:13.502 --> 39:16.046
and whether or not
you walk away right now.

39:18.131 --> 39:20.550
Walk away.

40:06.054 --> 40:08.098
Oh, my God, stop it.
You're killing him!

40:08.598 --> 40:10.767
Trey, get off of him, please!

40:11.143 --> 40:13.812
Please, stop it!
You're killing him!

40:13.937 --> 40:15.772
Stop it!

40:17.691 --> 40:19.943
You're gonna kill him!
