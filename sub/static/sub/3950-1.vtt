01:42.520 --> 01:44.314
<i>Yes! Oh, my God!</i>

02:27.065 --> 02:28.733
<i>Yes! Oh, my God!</i>

02:46.626 --> 02:50.380
<i>The magical crown jewels
at the bottom of the mystery cave.</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:54.384
<i>That's great. How do you get in?</i>

02:54.467 --> 02:56.052
<i>Oh, no! Guys!</i>

02:57.637 --> 02:58.805
<i>Oh, no!</i>

02:58.888 --> 03:00.890
<i>Pink, you're a wizard!</i>

03:00.974 --> 03:03.393
<i>Quick! Come in here! Follow me!</i>

03:05.395 --> 03:06.896
<i>Trixie, Pink, hurry up!</i>

03:07.438 --> 03:08.773
<i>Oh, no!</i>

03:27.834 --> 03:29.752
<i>Okay, guys, you might remember last week...</i>

03:29.836 --> 03:33.423
<i>I gave that great lecture
on Elvis Presley and the 1950s...</i>

03:33.506 --> 03:37.176
<i>but today we have to change gears
and talk about something...</i>

03:37.260 --> 03:39.637
<i>that's a little bit deeper,
a little harder to get at...</i>

03:39.721 --> 03:42.307
<i>which is the Civil Rights Movement,
or the black freedom struggle...</i>

03:42.390 --> 03:46.686
or what some historians have called
the second reconstruction.

03:46.769 --> 03:51.608
Which I really like because it ties it to
the first reconstruction after the Civil War...

03:51.691 --> 03:53.526
to show that there is a continuum...

03:53.610 --> 03:56.362
there is a constant struggle on the part
of African-Americans in the South...

03:56.446 --> 03:58.489
to claim their freedom, their liberty.

03:58.573 --> 04:01.659
And without a doubt...

04:01.743 --> 04:04.621
World War ll
really provides the fuel for this...

04:04.704 --> 04:07.248
that when you go overseas
to fight Hitler...

04:07.332 --> 04:10.627
you get shot at,
you see your friends killed...

04:11.169 --> 04:12.670
you're gonna come home
a different person.

04:12.754 --> 04:16.798
You're gonna come back
a radicalized individual...

04:16.882 --> 04:19.093
willing to risk life and limb.

04:19.177 --> 04:22.388
So the Double V campaign
during the war is quite interesting.

04:22.472 --> 04:26.559
It stood for victory at home
and victory abroad.

04:26.643 --> 04:29.520
Defeat Hitler and fascism
and its racist policies...

04:29.604 --> 04:32.815
but also defeat Jim Crow
and the racist South.

04:32.899 --> 04:35.944
And they tried to do that,
but they needed some help...

04:36.027 --> 04:38.905
and without question,
in one of the most important-

04:38.988 --> 04:44.327
I can feel- I can feel the presence
of almighty God in this room.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.912
Yes!

04:45.995 --> 04:48.831
The swagger is coming
all upon us, isn't it?

04:48.915 --> 04:51.417
Oh, yeah.

04:52.627 --> 04:54.087
Crazy Keith.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.172
Are you crazy for jesus?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.924
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.926
Are you jacked up on Jesus?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.095
I am. I am!

05:02.178 --> 05:04.889
- I'm feeling the almighty jesus in this room.
- All right!

05:04.973 --> 05:07.809
Are you all hearing me?
Let's all rise.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.979
Let's all rise and get a good “amen.”

05:11.729 --> 05:13.648
- Amen?
- Amen!

05:13.731 --> 05:15.316
- Amen!
- Amen!

05:15.400 --> 05:16.985
Praise God.

05:17.068 --> 05:19.320
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:19.404 --> 05:23.616
<i>Amen, amen, amen</i>

05:23.700 --> 05:27.620
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:27.704 --> 05:32.000
<i>Amen, amen, amen</i>

05:32.083 --> 05:36.087
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:36.170 --> 05:40.299
<i>Amen, amen, amen</i>

05:40.383 --> 05:43.386
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:44.053 --> 05:47.807
<i>Amen, amen, amen</i>

05:47.890 --> 05:51.477
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:51.561 --> 05:55.314
<i>Amen, amen, amen</i>

05:55.398 --> 05:59.110
<i>Amen, amen</i>

05:59.193 --> 06:01.154
<i>Amen, amen</i>

06:01.237 --> 06:02.989
In closing, we're gonna
read one more verse.

06:03.072 --> 06:06.409
I'm gonna read
from I Corinthians 10:13.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.661
It says,
“But when you are tempted...

06:08.745 --> 06:13.708
he will also provide a way out
so that you can endure it.”

06:13.791 --> 06:15.501
- How cool is that?
- Right.

06:15.585 --> 06:18.087
- Dudes, how cool is that?
- It's awesome.

06:19.464 --> 06:21.883
<i>Do you feel what that says?</i>

06:21.966 --> 06:25.344
<i>That every temptation
he '5 gonna give you a way out.</i>

06:25.428 --> 06:26.929
<i>- Y'all feel me?
- Yeah!</i>

06:27.013 --> 06:28.514
- <i>Can I get an amen?</i>
- <i>Amen!</i>

06:28.598 --> 06:30.516
<i>Let's close in a word of prayer.</i>

06:30.600 --> 06:33.811
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,
thank you so much for bringing me...</i>

06:33.895 --> 06:37.273
<i>into the presence of
these wonderful young Christians...</i>

06:37.356 --> 06:40.193
<i>to discuss and talk about temptation...</i>

06:40.276 --> 06:41.903
<i>to talk about Satan.</i>

06:58.795 --> 07:00.546
<i>Hey, you going to Florida?</i>

07:00.630 --> 07:02.131
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Who you going with?

07:02.215 --> 07:04.884
- Brit and Candy and Cotty.
- Be careful.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.553
- Why?
- Those girls are scary.

07:07.637 --> 07:10.139
- No.
- Especially Brit and Candy.

07:10.223 --> 07:11.849
Why do y'all say that?

07:11.933 --> 07:13.976
'Cause they're just so cold.
They act like they got demon blood.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.062
They're evil.
They give me the freakin' chill bumps.

07:16.145 --> 07:16.979
Yeah.

07:17.063 --> 07:19.065
No, I've known them since kindergarten.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.484
- They're sweet.
- They don't seem right.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.694
- I hope you pray down there in Florida.
- Pray hard-core.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.655
<i>Pray super hard-core.</i>

08:17.373 --> 08:20.418
He's so fucking high!

08:34.515 --> 08:36.183
Yeah! Hit that baby!

08:56.913 --> 08:59.040
Numbers! Come on, come on!

08:59.123 --> 09:00.541
Bounces!

09:11.135 --> 09:13.971
Nice!

09:39.997 --> 09:41.749
Good morning, sunshine.

09:41.832 --> 09:45.586
- Wakey-wakey.
- Rise and shine, little bitch.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.588
What do y'all want?

09:47.672 --> 09:49.507
We want your money.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.801
- Fuck off!
- Mind your own fucking business.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.636
- Get out!
- Your roommate sucks.

09:54.136 --> 09:56.222
- Come on, Faith. Wake up.
- Wake up!

09:56.305 --> 09:58.224
I'm up! What time is it?

09:58.307 --> 10:00.601
- Doesn't matter. We need your money.
- Where's the money?

10:00.685 --> 10:02.895
All right, really.
Where's your money?

10:02.979 --> 10:04.480
For what?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.816
You know what!

10:09.360 --> 10:10.736
<i>It's hot in here</i>

10:10.820 --> 10:12.738
<i>So take off all your clothes</i>

10:12.822 --> 10:14.740
<i>I am getting so hot</i>

10:14.824 --> 10:17.159
<i>I wanna take my clothes off</i>

10:17.243 --> 10:19.954
- <i>It's getting hot in here</i>
- <i>Oh, it's so hot!</i>

10:20.037 --> 10:21.038
<i>I'm taking off my clothes</i>

10:21.122 --> 10:23.040
<i>I am getting so hot</i>

10:23.124 --> 10:25.167
<i>I wanna take my clothes off</i>

10:25.793 --> 10:28.379
<i>With a little bit of ah-ah
and a little bit of ah-ah</i>

10:28.462 --> 10:30.172
Wait a minute. All right.

10:47.606 --> 10:52.320
20, 40, 60, 80, a hundred.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.782
- 325.
- What?

10:56.866 --> 10:59.035
- Are you serious?
- That's it?

11:00.703 --> 11:02.997
We're not even, like,
halfway to spring break, y'all.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.498
Fuck.

11:04.582 --> 11:07.126
That won't even get us
one night's hotel room down there.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.003
- I have another 20 in my purse.
- Faith.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.087
Faith.

11:10.171 --> 11:12.757
Do you know
how expensive that place is?

11:14.675 --> 11:18.971
So tired of seeing
the same things every single day.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.684
Everybody's miserable here
because everybody sees the same things.

11:23.768 --> 11:28.397
They wake up in the same bed,
the same houses...

11:29.940 --> 11:32.234
same depressing streetlights...

11:33.277 --> 11:35.363
one gas station.

11:35.446 --> 11:38.574
The grass, it's not even green.
It's brown.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.162
Everything is the same,
and everyone's just sad.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.707
I don't want to end up like them.
I really want to get out of here.

11:46.791 --> 11:49.502
This is more than just spring break.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.630
This is our chance to see
something different.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.595
<i>Everybody else already left.</i>

11:59.678 --> 12:02.556
<i>Yeah, everyone's gone.
We're the only ones still here.</i>

12:02.640 --> 12:04.517
<i>We fucking suck.</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:07.228
<i>We're leaving, you guys.
We're not gonna be stuck here.</i>

12:07.311 --> 12:09.397
<i>We 're not gonna be
the only ones here.</i>

12:09.480 --> 12:10.981
<i>We've been stuck here.</i>

12:11.065 --> 12:13.484
<i>We've been saving this money
since the beginning of the year.</i>

12:13.567 --> 12:15.569
<i>Well, we'll figure
a way out to get more.</i>

12:15.653 --> 12:18.197
How are we going to- How are we
gonna get enough money in time?

12:18.280 --> 12:21.367
I don't know. All I know is
I'm not gonna sit here another day.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.452
<i>I'm not gonna sit
in the same fucking classroom.</i>

12:23.994 --> 12:27.123
<i>We 're not gonna be miserable.
We 're getting out of here.</i>

12:35.506 --> 12:38.175
- <i>What's up, homes?</i>
- <i>What's up?</i>

12:39.885 --> 12:43.139
Can we use your car?

12:43.222 --> 12:44.223
No.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.475
- Why?
- It's in the shop.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.729
- Why?
- Do you know anyone else's car that we can use?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.481
<i>'</i> Shady!
<i>'</i> Do you?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.067
No.

12:55.151 --> 12:57.319
- Come on, Cotty.
- Everyone's pretty much gone.

13:06.162 --> 13:09.832
You know where Professor Stevens
keeps his car, don't you?

13:09.915 --> 13:12.334
- The El Camino?
- <i>Yes.</i>

13:22.678 --> 13:24.221
I know where he hides the keys.

13:24.305 --> 13:26.807
- Of course you do.
- Fuck you.

13:30.102 --> 13:33.355
Why? What are you up to?

13:33.439 --> 13:34.982
Don't worry.

13:40.196 --> 13:43.032
<i>Yo, we can do this. I know we can.</i>

13:43.782 --> 13:46.702
just fucking pretend
like it's a video game.

13:50.748 --> 13:53.000
Act like you're in a movie or something.

13:56.629 --> 13:58.130
We can do this.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.050
You can't be scared of shit.

14:02.051 --> 14:05.221
- But you gotta be hard.
- Fuck that.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.349
Don't be scared of nothin'.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.938
<i>Let's just get that fucking cash
and go on spring break.</i>

14:20.778 --> 14:23.656
<i>just pretend it's a fucking video game.</i>

14:23.739 --> 14:26.617
<i>Act like you're in a movie
or something.</i>

14:27.701 --> 14:29.787
<i>You can't be scared of shit.</i>

14:29.870 --> 14:31.872
<i>You have to be hard.</i>

14:32.623 --> 14:35.084
Don't be scared of anything.

14:37.086 --> 14:40.256
<i>Let's just get this fucking money
and go on spring break, y'all.</i>

14:40.339 --> 14:42.758
Fuck yeah.
Let's fucking do it.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.389
Fuck yeah!

16:39.208 --> 16:41.502
Move! Go! Go!

17:21.500 --> 17:24.211
<i>Look. Oh, my gosh.</i>

17:24.294 --> 17:26.547
- How much money is that?
- Look at all this.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.590
A lot.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.509
Where did it all come from?

17:30.592 --> 17:33.262
- We robbed the Chicken Shack.
- Shut up.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.346
With squirt guns.

17:34.430 --> 17:36.765
- Are you serious?
- With squirt guns!

17:36.849 --> 17:39.810
<i>We did it. We pulled it off.
We really fucking pulled it off.</i>

17:39.893 --> 17:42.396
- It was fucking awesome.
- Oh, my God.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.440
Hey. Spring break.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.900
Take a hit!

17:49.111 --> 17:50.571
Suck.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.283
Okay!

17:55.117 --> 17:56.660
<i>Fucking spring break!</i>

17:56.744 --> 18:00.497
- <i>We have 50 much money.</i>
- <i>You guys are 50 crazy.</i>

18:00.581 --> 18:03.709
Seeing all this money
makes my pussy wet.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.004
- Smell this shit. Smell this shit.
- It makes my tits look bigger.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.090
<i>Spring break. Spring break.</i>

18:30.152 --> 18:35.073
Spring break! Spring break!
Spring break! Spring break!

19:00.599 --> 19:02.100
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

19:03.519 --> 19:05.729
<i>Having so much fun here.</i>

19:05.813 --> 19:07.689
<i>This place is special.</i>

19:10.859 --> 19:14.363
<i>I'm starting to think this is
the most spiritual place I've ever been.</i>

19:19.701 --> 19:21.745
<i>I think we found ourselves here.</i>

19:22.579 --> 19:25.290
<i>We finally got to see
some other parts of the world.</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:28.836
<i>We saw some beautiful things here.</i>

19:30.546 --> 19:33.507
<i>God, I can't believe
how many new friends we made.</i>

19:34.258 --> 19:37.469
<i>Friends from all over the place.
I mean, everyone was so sweet here.</i>

19:37.553 --> 19:40.222
<i>So warm and friendly.</i>

19:42.766 --> 19:45.227
<i>It's way more than just having a good time.</i>

19:48.397 --> 19:52.234
<i>God, it was so nice to get a break
from reality for a little while.</i>

19:56.280 --> 19:58.574
<i>I'll always remember this trip.</i>

19:59.491 --> 20:03.537
<i>I wanna come back again
next year with you.</i>

20:04.246 --> 20:08.208
<i>Something so amazing, magical.</i>

20:08.292 --> 20:11.211
<i>Something so beautiful.</i>

20:12.379 --> 20:14.590
<i>Feels as if the world is perfect.</i>

20:15.299 --> 20:17.342
<i>Like it's never gonna end.</i>

20:54.463 --> 20:58.175
Yeah! Are you ready? We 'bout to go live!

20:58.258 --> 20:59.843
<i>Junkies at my door</i>

20:59.927 --> 21:01.720
<i>They know the secret knock</i>

21:01.803 --> 21:05.349
<i>It go one time for the reefer
Two time for the rock</i>

21:05.432 --> 21:06.892
<i>Baking soda my best friend</i>

21:06.975 --> 21:08.644
<i>My fork is my fiancé</i>

21:08.727 --> 21:12.189
<i>My crackpot sing and dance
I call that bitch Beyoncé?</i>

21:12.272 --> 21:13.815
<i>I can get an ounce for 850</i>

21:13.899 --> 21:15.609
<i>But the Super Clean will cost a stack</i>

21:15.692 --> 21:19.488
<i>If you money right and you see the light,

21:19.571 --> 21:21.865
<i>'Cause I'm hangin'
with them dope boyz</i>

21:21.949 --> 21:23.867
<i>'Cause I'm hangin'
with them dope boyz</i>

21:23.951 --> 21:27.120
<i>My motherfuckin' wrist go ham</i>

21:27.204 --> 21:30.749
<i>Hangin' with them dope boyz
Hangin' with them dope boyz</i>

21:30.832 --> 21:33.627
<i>Look at my wrist
Goddamn</i>

21:34.378 --> 21:36.797
Peace, spring break! What's happenin'?

21:36.880 --> 21:40.050
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
What up, what up, St. Pete's?

21:42.844 --> 21:45.555
Yo, you all just got transported.
I don't know if you know that.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.934
- But we're in a magic place, y'all!
- Yeah!

21:49.017 --> 21:51.478
Yo, I ain't even from this planet.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.063
I'm from a different planet, y'all...

21:53.146 --> 21:56.858
and I just transported y'all
out into fucking space, y'all.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.528
Yeah!

21:59.611 --> 22:02.948
<i>Yo, here's some poetry. I was laying
on the beach, y'all. There's palm trees, y'all.</i>

22:03.031 --> 22:06.660
<i>This is the room of the world, y'all.
You can change yo' life.</i>

22:06.743 --> 22:09.079
<i>You can change who you are, y'all.</i>

22:09.162 --> 22:12.290
<i>You just got hypnotized
and transported to another realm, y'all.</i>

22:12.374 --> 22:14.584
And this lasts forever!

22:14.668 --> 22:16.628
We're forever, bitch!

22:16.712 --> 22:19.715
We gonna change the world, y'all.
This is poetry in motion.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.384
Big booties and money fallin', y'all.

22:23.719 --> 22:27.222
Bikinis and big booties, y'all!
That's what life is about!

22:29.391 --> 22:32.811
Spring break forever, y'all!
Spring break, let me hear you!

22:32.894 --> 22:34.730
Let me hear you, spring break!

22:40.777 --> 22:42.654
I know!

23:16.688 --> 23:18.982
Y'all, it's like paradise here.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.319
I know. I love it.

23:23.528 --> 23:26.156
I wish we could all
buy a house here together.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.908
Oh, yes.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.121
I don't ever want to leave.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.083
Fuck school.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.667
Just fuck it.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.127
No!

23:43.799 --> 23:45.509
All right!

23:56.478 --> 23:58.939
Fuckers! Take that! Take that!

23:59.022 --> 24:01.775
- Oil change.
- Check it out!

24:02.317 --> 24:03.610
Yeah! There ya go!

24:03.693 --> 24:06.029
<i>Know what would be really cool?</i>

24:06.113 --> 24:08.490
If we could freeze life.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.285
Like if we could just...

24:13.995 --> 24:15.497
click it-

24:16.373 --> 24:17.958
and freeze it and say...

24:18.875 --> 24:21.378
this is the way it's gonna be forever.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.466
Like have this moment together forever.

24:28.677 --> 24:32.180
That'd be real cool, Faith.
Really cool.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.146
I'm not drunk enough for that.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.691
That'd be, like, really cool.
“So cool, y'all.”

24:44.568 --> 24:45.944
Are <i>y'all</i> making fun of me?

24:46.027 --> 24:47.612
- No.
- We just think you're cute.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.614
We just want to click things
and freeze them.

24:49.698 --> 24:53.869
And buy houses together
and go to church services and pray.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.956
<i>I'm serious, y'all.</i>

24:58.957 --> 25:00.709
- It's different here.
- You like <i>that?</i>

25:00.792 --> 25:04.504
- How 'bout this? Here we go!
- Yeah! There ya go!

25:04.588 --> 25:07.340
- That's what I'm talkin' about!
- Take it like a stripper.

25:08.717 --> 25:11.052
Goddamn, you look sexy.
I want that pussy, baby.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.638
You're never gonna get this pussy.

25:13.722 --> 25:17.225
<i>Never gonna get this pussy</i>

25:17.309 --> 25:20.103
<i>Never gonna get</i>

25:20.187 --> 25:23.648
<i>This pussy</i>

25:25.400 --> 25:27.027
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

25:27.110 --> 25:28.904
<i>I'm having so much fun here.</i>

25:29.905 --> 25:32.574
<i>It's so cool-lookin'.</i>

25:32.657 --> 25:34.910
<i>The people here are so much fun.</i>

25:34.993 --> 25:36.995
<i>They're all really sweet.</i>

25:41.041 --> 25:43.543
<i>Okay? One, two, three!</i>

25:43.627 --> 25:46.296
<i>- Go!
- Oh, no!</i>

25:46.379 --> 25:47.964
<i>It's so scary!</i>

25:48.048 --> 25:50.592
<i>The food. The guys.</i>

25:50.675 --> 25:52.761
<i>You would love it here.</i>

25:52.844 --> 25:55.597
<i>I wanna come back again
next year with you.</i>

25:57.432 --> 25:59.017
<i>That would be cool.</i>

25:59.100 --> 26:01.102
<i>No, I miss you too.</i>

26:02.604 --> 26:04.814
<i>But I really like it here.</i>

26:06.900 --> 26:10.695
<i>I know, Mom. I'm sorry.
I should've told you that I came.</i>

26:11.571 --> 26:13.782
You'd never have let me go.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.619
<i>I'm- I'm fine.</i>

26:17.702 --> 26:19.287
<i>Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

26:19.955 --> 26:22.415
<i>I should've told you.
I just wanted to go.</i>

26:24.459 --> 26:26.294
<i>I know.</i>

26:30.632 --> 26:33.969
Well, we had enough money, so-

26:34.052 --> 26:37.430
<i>We wanted to get away, and we're fine.</i>

26:37.514 --> 26:40.475
<i>We're- We're... safe.</i>

26:40.558 --> 26:42.852
<i>Urn, not drinking.</i>

26:42.936 --> 26:45.981
<i>Just- W-We got scooters.</i>

26:46.064 --> 26:47.774
<i>We're just driving around.</i>

26:47.857 --> 26:51.611
<i>We're meeting people and-
I'm having fun. I'm fine.</i>

26:55.407 --> 26:58.243
- I'm gonna fuck-
- Fuck you, bitch.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.662
No, you're not. No, you're not.

27:00.745 --> 27:03.123
- I'm gonna fuck-
- You know why?

27:03.206 --> 27:05.542
- Why?
- 'Cause you're a little bitch.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.168
I will. Okay.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.048
<i>All right.</i>

27:12.132 --> 27:13.591
<i>I love you too.</i>

27:13.675 --> 27:15.260
Bye.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.807
I never want to go home.
Never want to go back.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.809
- Me neither.
- Same.

27:23.935 --> 27:26.771
I just finally feel like...

27:26.855 --> 27:29.357
I can be who I was supposed to be here.

27:31.901 --> 27:35.822
<i>I know you did a really bad thing,
but I'm really glad you did it.</i>

27:41.578 --> 27:44.039
I feel better here.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.969
Eighteen packs for $10.

27:58.053 --> 28:01.181
- Oh, that's cheap as hell.
- It's a steal!

28:01.264 --> 28:03.433
That shit's cheap as hell!

28:05.143 --> 28:06.728
Except that guy-

28:06.811 --> 28:10.774
- Oh, that guy we got stuck talking to-
- He was so weird.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.985
Next time, with those people
we don't like, we'll talk deaf.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.529
- <i>We'll</i> pretend like we're deaf.
- And then they'll go.

28:17.906 --> 28:19.657
That is so mean!

28:20.825 --> 28:23.411
“You wanna fuck me?”

28:29.834 --> 28:31.294
<i>on, baby</i>

28:31.378 --> 28:32.545
<i>How was I</i>

28:32.629 --> 28:35.173
<i>Supposed to know</i>

28:35.256 --> 28:36.424
<i>Yeah</i>

28:36.508 --> 28:39.761
<i>That somethin' wasn't right, yeah</i>

28:39.844 --> 28:43.681
<i>Show me how you want it to be</i>

28:43.765 --> 28:46.059
- What does she do in this video? She goes-
- Tell me, <i>baby</i>

28:46.142 --> 28:49.104
- <i>'Cause I need to know</i>
- She's <i>like, no! No!</i>

28:50.480 --> 28:52.107
<i>My loneliness</i>

28:52.190 --> 28:53.691
<i>Is killin' me</i>

28:53.775 --> 28:55.318
<i>And I</i>

28:55.402 --> 28:56.945
<i>I must confess</i>

28:57.028 --> 28:58.696
<i>I still believe</i>

28:58.780 --> 29:00.865
<i>Still believe</i>

29:00.949 --> 29:03.827
- You're such a good singer.
- Let me find my pitch.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.664
<i>Hit me, baby, one more time</i>

29:07.747 --> 29:09.457
Go, baby!

29:09.541 --> 29:11.334
- Go, baby!
- Be careful.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.336
Open yo' mouth, bitch.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.755
Open your mouth, bitch!

29:15.839 --> 29:17.340
- She was in the car.
- I was in the car.

29:17.424 --> 29:21.970
I was sitting there looking out
for all the motherfucking police.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.223
We in the back,
and we just opened the door, and we go-

29:25.306 --> 29:27.809
“Freeze, motherfuckers!
Hands in the motherfucking air!”

29:27.892 --> 29:31.104
<i>“Get your motherfucking knees on
the motherfucking ground, you piece of shit!”</i>

29:31.187 --> 29:33.440
“Move, motherfuckers!
Down, motherfucker! Down!”

29:33.523 --> 29:36.317
Get on your fucking knees, Faith.
Get on your fucking knees.

29:39.446 --> 29:42.907
“Get your motherfucking knees
on the fucking ground!”

29:42.991 --> 29:44.617
What did they do?

29:44.701 --> 29:46.995
They fucking got on the ground.

29:50.457 --> 29:53.501
- Now!
- What, you wanna die tonight? I don't think so!

29:57.922 --> 30:00.216
Give me your fucking wallet now!

30:00.300 --> 30:03.219
Give me your wallet now!
Give me your fucking wallet!

30:03.303 --> 30:04.762
<i>That's right.</i>

30:04.846 --> 30:06.764
I put my shit up to this bitch,
and I was going...

30:06.848 --> 30:09.058
“Yo, fuckin' get
on your goddamn knees...

30:09.142 --> 30:11.311
before I shoot
your motherfucking face off.”

30:11.394 --> 30:14.022
“If you give me your motherfucking money,
I won't kill you.”

30:14.105 --> 30:17.734
Get down on the ﬂoor?
Give me your fucking wallet! Now!

30:17.817 --> 30:21.070
- You fucking hear me? You fucking hear me?
- Let's get the fuck outta here!

30:21.154 --> 30:23.281
- “Fuckin' brains. Get on the ground.”
- “You wanna fucking die tonight?

30:23.364 --> 30:25.492
You wanna fucking die tonight?
Give me all your goddamn money.

30:25.575 --> 30:27.327
Give it to me now!

30:27.410 --> 30:29.204
Get on your fucking knees!”

30:29.287 --> 30:31.664
- <i>Y'all</i> said that?
- Yeah, we said that.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.208
Get on your knees.

30:33.291 --> 30:36.127
Get on your motherfucking knees, bitch!
Get on your knees.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.670
- Do you wanna die tonight?
- No.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.255
- You fucking scared?
- Yes.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.966
You fuckin' piece of shit!
Give me your fuckin' money!

30:42.050 --> 30:43.927
- Give me the fuckin' money!
- Don't kill me.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.553
Give it to us.

30:45.637 --> 30:48.640
Give us your motherfucking
money now, bitch.

30:48.723 --> 30:51.726
Give me all your
motherfucking money! Now!

30:52.810 --> 30:55.438
<i>You gotta learn, man. It's amazing.</i>

30:55.522 --> 30:57.315
- <i>Stick with us.</i>
- <i>It's the best way to live, man.</i>

30:57.398 --> 30:58.566
<i>And you'll be a goonie too.</i>

30:58.650 --> 31:02.153
And you'll have all this power,
and you'll have all the money you want.

31:02.237 --> 31:04.697
All the money you want!

31:06.741 --> 31:08.868
Crazy!

33:46.442 --> 33:48.611
Unless you wanna get arrested, keep sitting.

33:56.577 --> 33:59.831
- Motherfucker.
- Shut up.

33:59.914 --> 34:00.915
Get in the car.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.500
Faith?

34:13.594 --> 34:15.596
Faith, it's okay.

34:29.152 --> 34:30.945
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

34:32.280 --> 34:34.114
<i>This isn't supposed to happen.</i>

34:36.617 --> 34:38.619
<i>I don't understand.</i>

34:40.705 --> 34:44.458
<i>We were just having fun.
We didn't do anything wrong.</i>

34:48.713 --> 34:51.507
<i>This is where we were
supposed to find ourselves.</i>

34:54.844 --> 34:58.181
<i>This is where we were supposed
to find who we are.</i>

34:59.307 --> 35:01.642
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

35:05.938 --> 35:08.149
<i>This wasn't the dream.</i>

35:09.567 --> 35:12.236
<i>It's not supposed to end this way.</i>

35:15.323 --> 35:17.158
<i>It can't end this way.</i>

35:21.245 --> 35:22.455
<i>It can't end this way.</i>

35:26.834 --> 35:29.128
<i>This is where we were
gonna be forever.</i>

35:32.965 --> 35:34.675
<i>This isn't the end.</i>

35:35.760 --> 35:38.346
<i>This can't be the end of the dream.</i>

35:44.018 --> 35:46.270
Yo, fuck you, man!

35:46.354 --> 35:47.855
Let's go.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.632
Now let me guess.
Spring breakers?

36:14.715 --> 36:17.301
You're not gonna be charged
with a narcotics possession...

36:17.385 --> 36:19.637
'cause it wasn't found
on your actual person.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.722
You will be issued citations...

36:21.806 --> 36:25.268
but you're gonna have to pay the fines
or you're gonna do two more clays in county.

36:37.071 --> 36:39.365
<i>We're gonna be in so much trouble.</i>

36:43.077 --> 36:45.580
This wasn't supposed to happen.

36:48.499 --> 36:51.377
But you are gonna be issued citations.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.922
You're gonna have to pay the fine,
or you can do two more clays in county.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.259
We don't have any money.

36:58.968 --> 37:01.178
Call mommy or daddy or do the time.

37:01.262 --> 37:05.850
Spring break is not an invitation
to do drugs or commit crimes.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.603
Thank you.
Have fun, girls.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.584
Somebody loves y'all. You're free to go.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.210
Just made bail.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.088
- Really?
- Yes.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.502
Mornin'.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.254
Who are you?

38:17.338 --> 38:19.173
My name's Alien.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.677
My real name's Al,
but truth be told...

38:22.760 --> 38:24.804
I ain't from this planet, y'all.

38:25.513 --> 38:27.640
Alien?

38:27.723 --> 38:29.266
That's what they call me.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.436
- Why are you here?
- I saw y'all in there.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.522
<i>Looked like nice people.</i>

38:34.605 --> 38:37.441
<i>Thought maybe I'd bail you out.</i>

38:37.525 --> 38:40.861
Everyone can use a little bailing out
once in a while.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.197
Why?

38:45.074 --> 38:46.075
Why not?

38:49.328 --> 38:51.956
Come on, y'all.
Why you acting 'spicious?

38:52.039 --> 38:54.375
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

38:55.042 --> 38:56.794
We can go wherever you all want.

38:56.877 --> 38:57.878
Cotty.

38:59.505 --> 39:03.050
She's got the right idea.
Come on. <i>I'll</i> be your chauffeur.

44:31.211 --> 44:32.963
- I'm the police!
- Get up on it.

44:37.384 --> 44:39.803
Get these girls up in here.

44:39.887 --> 44:41.513
Let the girls play.

44:42.264 --> 44:44.433
Faith, come here.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.560
- No, no, no.
- Come here!

44:48.395 --> 44:49.897
That one?

44:54.526 --> 44:55.861

44:58.739 --> 45:00.741
Yo, let Faith shoot.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.243
Faith, go!

45:04.370 --> 45:09.249
<i>I'm going home.
I don't like it here. This is just too weird.</i>

45:09.333 --> 45:11.251
This is not what we came here for.

45:11.335 --> 45:14.004
We came here to have fun,
and we came here to party.

45:14.088 --> 45:15.589
<i>It is fun.</i>

45:15.672 --> 45:18.634
<i>- Why are you crying?
- This is not what it was supposed to be.</i>

45:18.717 --> 45:21.637
<i>It's not fair to me because
this is not what I signed up for...</i>

45:21.720 --> 45:23.764
<i>and I'm very uncomfortable.</i>

45:23.847 --> 45:26.809
<i>I don't know these people.
And we were in jail.</i>

45:26.892 --> 45:29.603
And this guy that I don't even know
checks us out of the jail...

45:29.686 --> 45:31.688
and then says all this weird stuff...

45:31.772 --> 45:33.857
<i>and brings us here with these people...</i>

45:33.941 --> 45:36.777
<i>like, touching us and talking to us...</i>

45:36.860 --> 45:38.779
<i>and I don't know them,
and I don't feel comfortable.</i>

45:38.862 --> 45:42.533
<i>I want to go home.
This is not what I signed up for.</i>

45:42.616 --> 45:44.034
Maybe.

45:44.118 --> 45:47.037
<i>I don't like it here.
Please just take me home.</i>

45:47.121 --> 45:49.039
- Come on.just come with me.
- I just-

45:49.123 --> 45:51.458
Come on. We gon' party.
Stop actin' scared.

45:51.542 --> 45:53.043
It's okay, Faith.

45:53.127 --> 45:55.379
Faith, we're not gonna let anything
happen to you. All right?

45:55.462 --> 45:56.964
It's okay.

46:03.929 --> 46:05.431
Can I talk to you?

46:06.348 --> 46:08.809
You all right?
What's wrong?

46:09.977 --> 46:12.729
I just- I want to go home.

46:12.813 --> 46:14.982
Why? You upset?

46:15.065 --> 46:17.151
- I don't like it here.
- Why?

46:17.234 --> 46:18.777
What's wrong?

46:21.738 --> 46:23.824
This isn't why we came here.

46:25.033 --> 46:26.660
Why'd you come here?

46:30.330 --> 46:32.249
I don't like where we're from...

46:32.332 --> 46:35.127
so I thought that
if we came here that we could...

46:35.210 --> 46:38.005
be free or just have fun.

46:38.088 --> 46:40.215
Okay. isn't that what we're doing?

46:40.299 --> 46:41.967
Ain't we having fun?

46:43.010 --> 46:44.595
No.

46:44.678 --> 46:47.598
What kind of fun
did you want to have?

46:47.681 --> 46:49.933
- Not going to jail.
- Well, you're out of jail now.

46:50.017 --> 46:52.686
I didn't get you in jail.
I got you out of jail.

46:54.354 --> 46:56.523
So don't put that on me.

46:58.609 --> 47:00.652
I don't know you.

47:00.736 --> 47:03.572
All right. And?

47:03.655 --> 47:05.949
I don't know what you want
with me and my friends...

47:06.033 --> 47:08.243
but you should leave us alone.

47:08.327 --> 47:10.496
What? I'm just trying to be nice.

47:10.579 --> 47:12.915
Let's go home.

47:13.540 --> 47:15.709
Please come back with me.

47:16.293 --> 47:18.921
Please come back home with me.

I like you.

47:45.739 --> 47:47.908
I ain't gonna do nothin' to hurt you.

47:49.409 --> 47:51.245
Don't you see that?

47:51.328 --> 47:54.039
If you want to go home,
you can go home.

47:54.706 --> 47:56.792
But then you're just gonna be home.

47:57.751 --> 48:00.420
Just gonna be back
right where you started.

48:02.422 --> 48:04.716
And you'll be thinking...

48:07.970 --> 48:10.514
Maybe I missed something out there.”

48:15.102 --> 48:16.603
You want to go?

48:17.938 --> 48:19.147
Why?

48:21.692 --> 48:25.195
Why? Why you so upset?
Nothing's wrong.

Nothing's wrong.

48:27.739 --> 48:31.159

48:44.298 --> 48:46.216
Your friends are gonna stay with me.

48:46.300 --> 48:50.262
And I want you to know
that I like you so much.

48:52.514 --> 48:54.349
I really do.

48:55.309 --> 48:57.561
And your friends ain't gonna go with you.

49:05.027 --> 49:08.614
And I'm gonna be thinking about you
when I'm with your friends, okay?

49:09.823 --> 49:11.783
<i>Let's go home, please.</i>

49:12.492 --> 49:16.121
<i>I can tell that something

Please. I just have
a really, really bad feeling about this.

Don't leave us.

49:43.398 --> 49:44.900
I love you.

49:46.860 --> 49:50.197
- I'm going. I'm gonna miss my bus.
- No! No!

51:04.271 --> 51:06.314
<i>Y'all</i> be careful of that water.

51:08.066 --> 51:10.068
Lots of sharks out there.

51:10.986 --> 51:14.281
And the water looks real pretty,
but the sharks are waitin'.

51:14.990 --> 51:18.034
Bunch of vicious motherfuckers.

51:18.118 --> 51:21.288
Just lurking.just lurking.

51:23.999 --> 51:26.001
Lurking.

51:28.336 --> 51:29.504
Goddamn!

51:35.469 --> 51:37.471
I must be dreaming.

51:40.891 --> 51:42.809
Like a fuckin' calendar.

51:44.811 --> 51:47.063
<i>These three girls...</i>

51:47.147 --> 51:48.648
<i>in front of me.</i>

51:49.733 --> 51:52.486
<i>I can't believe what I see.</i>

51:53.487 --> 51:55.155
<i>How can this be?</i>

51:56.114 --> 51:59.868
<i>They're like mermaids
come up from the sea.</i>

52:01.995 --> 52:04.372
<i>Close my eyes...</i>

52:04.456 --> 52:05.999
<i>every time I look.</i>

52:07.292 --> 52:10.837
<i>They're like old-fashioned bitches
straight out a book.</i>

52:13.507 --> 52:17.552
<i>These three girls in front of me.</i>

52:18.678 --> 52:21.014
Can't believe what I see.

52:23.183 --> 52:26.228
<i>Y'all making it so easy for me.</i>

52:28.355 --> 52:30.190
<i>What I did to deserve this.</i>

52:31.691 --> 52:34.194
<i>My lucky year,</i>

<i>Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.</i>

52:42.202 --> 52:44.871
<i>I must've done somethin' good.</i>

52:49.209 --> 52:50.627
Some kids-

52:50.710 --> 52:53.171
Some little kids-
they want to grow up to be president.

52:53.255 --> 52:55.632
Some kids want to be a doctor.

52:55.715 --> 52:57.968
You know, I just wanted to be bad.

52:58.051 --> 53:00.303
They kicked me out of school.
I thought that was great.

53:00.387 --> 53:03.390
<i>Shit, I don't have to go to your school.
That was the best thing in the world.</i>

53:06.226 --> 53:08.645
<i>Some people-
they want to do the right thing.</i>

53:08.728 --> 53:10.856
<i>I like doing the wrong thing.</i>

53:10.939 --> 53:13.775
<i>Everyone's always telling me,
“Yo, you gotta change.”</i>

53:14.359 --> 53:16.653
<i>I'm about stacking change, y'all.</i>

53:16.736 --> 53:18.488
<i>Stacking change.</i>

53:18.572 --> 53:19.990
<i>That's it- money.</i>

53:20.073 --> 53:23.368
<i>I'm about making money.
That's the dream, y'all.</i>

53:23.451 --> 53:25.412
<i>That's the American dream.</i>

53:26.580 --> 53:29.708
<i>That's it. I did it.</i>

<i>Most of my brothers and sisters-

53:32.168 --> 53:34.754
<i>It was all bad.
They got murdered.</i>

53:35.255 --> 53:39.551
<i>I'm the last one standing,
and I'm as bad as they is.</i>

53:39.634 --> 53:43.680
<i>It's just in our blood, y'all, and I love it.</i>

53:43.763 --> 53:45.432
<i>This was my dream.</i>

53:45.515 --> 53:47.726
I made it come true.

53:48.768 --> 53:51.688
This is the fucking American dream, y'all.

<i>They call him Big Arch.</i>

56:11.411 --> 56:16.791
<i>Them dudes is straight-off-the-block,

<i>Hey, my nigga, you got a lot of fucking nerve.</i>

56:25.050 --> 56:26.593
<i>Why, am I in trouble?</i>

56:26.676 --> 56:28.470
So you gonna bring your ass into my trap.

56:28.553 --> 56:31.306
- I'm just here to have a little fun.
- You're here to have some fun.

56:31.389 --> 56:33.850
You must think this is when we were kids
or somethin'. You remember that?

56:33.933 --> 56:35.852
Of course I remember.
You was my best friend.

56:35.935 --> 56:39.022
Yeah, you took me to the ocean that one time.
That's the only time I've ever been.

56:39.105 --> 56:41.524
Yeah. Taught your ass how to swim.

56:41.608 --> 56:43.651
Yeah, and I taught you everything you know.

56:44.319 --> 56:46.654
- I ain't denyin' it.
- But now you think you're a boss.

56:46.738 --> 56:49.991
You got your own operation.
You slick, and I don't like that shit.

56:51.618 --> 56:55.330
What you want me to do? You want me
to stay in your shadow for the rest of my life?

56:55.413 --> 56:59.000
I want you to buy a fuckin' surfboard and go back
in the middle of the ocean and disappear.

56:59.084 --> 57:02.045
Go back to doing what white boys do,
like robbing spring breakers...

57:02.128 --> 57:04.631
hide down the board-walk
like we did when we was kids.

57:05.298 --> 57:07.801
Sounds to me like someone's getting greedy.

57:23.108 --> 57:24.984
Sounds to me like somebody's getting pissed.

57:25.068 --> 57:27.570
You saying there ain't enough to go around?

57:27.654 --> 57:29.739
Fuck no. You know I own these streets.

57:53.054 --> 57:55.348
So you can handle all this on your own?

57:56.307 --> 57:59.269
- You think you can handle it?
- Arch, you made me.

57:59.352 --> 58:01.896
Anything you can handle, I can handle.

58:01.980 --> 58:04.274
Just like I made you, I'm gonna break you.

59:07.629 --> 59:10.340
Tell Arch and them niggas

59:10.423 --> 59:13.259
Tell Arch and them motherfuckers
come fuck with me now.

59:13.343 --> 59:16.012
<i>I'll</i> fuckin' blast their fuckin' asses.

59:46.501 --> 59:50.213
You like my shit?
Look at you fuckin' bitches.

59:50.296 --> 59:51.547
You fuckin' love it, don't you?

59:51.631 --> 59:54.008
- I fuckin' love it.
- You couple of bad bitches, ain't you?

59:54.092 --> 59:55.885
Bad bitches.

59:56.719 --> 01:00:00.723

- Hey, let me smell it.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.809
Let me smell it.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:34.382
Careful with that. it's loaded.

01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:38.636
That's loaded.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.305
- That's better.
- Careful.

01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:42.265
- Yeah, that's fucking nice.
- Don't point it at me.

01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:45.768
- It's a nice fucking gun.
- Don't point it at me.

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:51.691
Sit the fuck down.

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:53.568
Get down on your motherfucking knees.

Do you know who you're fucking talking to?

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:03.119
Sick motherfucker, aren't you?

01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:06.664
You are. You think that

Do you like that?

01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:30.813
You like that in there?

01:01:32.148 --> 01:01:34.734
We have everything we need right here.

01:01:34.817 --> 01:01:36.986
We don't need you, Alien.

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:40.615
What if we just used you to come here?

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:43.326
- What if we just-
- And in five seconds we just shoot you.

01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:46.454

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.546
- Should we kill him?
- I don't know.

You want more?

I just sucked both y'all's dicks.

01:02:41.634 --> 01:02:43.845
- Did you like it?
- You loved it.

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.431
And you're gonna do it again.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:50.560
<i>I'll</i> do that shit every night.

I just fell in love with y'all.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:10.621
<i>You girls is different from the rest.</i>

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.626
<i>I knew y'all was special
from the moment I saw you.</i>

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:18.212
<i>It's in your eyes.</i>

01:03:19.088 --> 01:03:21.340
<i>It's written on your faces.</i>

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:24.218
<i>I want to make you happy.</i>

01:03:24.302 --> 01:03:27.263

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:03.466
- Play something.
- What y'all want to hear?

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:07.803
Maybe something sweet. Something uplifting.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:10.556
- Something sweet and uplifting?
- Yeah.

01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:13.309
Play something inspiring.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:16.979

- Sure do.

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:18.981
Play something fucking inspiring.

01:04:19.065 --> 01:04:20.566
All right.

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:24.987
This one's by a little-known pop singer
by the name of Miss Britney Spears.

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:28.699
One of the greatest singers of all time...

01:04:28.783 --> 01:04:31.911
and an angel,
if there ever was one on this Earth.

01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:44.298
<i>Notice me</i>

01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:49.554
<i>Take my hand</i>

01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:53.808
<i>Why are we</i>

01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:58.104
<i>Strangers when</i>

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:02.233
- <i>Our love was strong?</i>
- <i>Our love was strong?</i>

01:05:03.568 --> 01:05:07.989
<i>Why carry on without me?</i>

01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:11.033
<i>Every time I try to fly</i>

01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:14.537
<i>I fall without my wings</i>

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.331
<i>I feel so small</i>

01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:21.252
<i>I guess I need you, baby</i>

01:07:59.702 --> 01:08:02.163
<i>Spring break.</i>

01:08:02.246 --> 01:08:04.457
Spring break, bitches!

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:19.596
Alien's bringing too much heat down.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.348
And I don't like it.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.895
He's taking food out of my baby's mouth,
and my baby's hungry.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:30.316
My baby needs to eat.
My baby's starving.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.984
And we're gonna do something about it.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.341
Come on.

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:13.359
- Not bad.
- Are you proud?

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:17.196
- Not bad. Not bad.
- Yeah.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:31.627
What, you all following me now?

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:35.548
Merry spring motherfuckin' break.

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:39.385
What's up, my nigga?
What's up, Alien?

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:41.886
Fuck your bitches looking at, man?

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.889
<i>Y'all</i> want to die tonight?

01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:46.100
<i>Y'all motherfucking want to die today?</i>

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.310
I've been looking for you.
Where the fuck you been?

01:09:48.394 --> 01:09:51.354
You been hiding?
Listen, these are my streets, man.

01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:54.483
These streets belong to me.
Not you, motherfucker.

01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:56.777
I should kill your stupid ass.

01:09:56.861 --> 01:09:59.780
You need to know that. Get that
through your thick fucking skull, man.

01:09:59.864 --> 01:10:02.575
This would be a good night
to kill somebody, man.

01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:05.494
I should probably shoot you
in your motherfuckin' face.

01:10:06.579 --> 01:10:08.914
Merry Christmas.

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:17.590
Cotty, are you okay?

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:19.610
I'm so sorry.

01:11:23.238 --> 01:11:25.574
I should've never let this happen to you.

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:31.872
You know I care about you.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.920
I ain't gonna let him get away with this.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.204
<i>I want to go home now.</i>

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.749
Spring break's over.

01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:19.712
I know you both want to stay.

01:12:20.546 --> 01:12:22.214
I'm gon' get him.

01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:34.226
I don't want you to go home.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:44.653
Please.

01:12:44.737 --> 01:12:47.197
<i>Four little chickies</i>

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:51.618
<i>Came down to the beach</i>

01:12:54.788 --> 01:13:01.295
<i>Four little chickies

I like that.

01:20:09.181 --> 01:20:11.475
I feel like I'm living the American dream.

01:20:11.558 --> 01:20:13.685
I don't ever want this shit to stop.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:17.898
Look at these titties

Come here, puss.
Damn, baby.

01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:24.404
Feel like you're playing piano on my dick.

Like you're playing Mozart.

01:20:38.919 --> 01:20:40.504
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:46.968
I'm good. Yeah, I've actually
been thinking a lot lately.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.222
I just want to do better.

01:20:57.729 --> 01:21:00.982
Better at school, better at life.

01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:03.652
I just feel different for some reason.

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:08.573
<i>I feel changed,

01:21:09.533 --> 01:21:12.077
<i>I mean, I want to be happy and have fun.</i>

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.998
Yeah, Mommy,
I think that's the secret to life.

01:21:17.082 --> 01:21:18.833
Being a good person.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.258
<i>Hi, Mom, it's Candy.</i>

01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:29.135
I'm sorry I haven't called in so long.

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:32.180
I know.
No, I know, I know.

01:21:32.264 --> 01:21:34.391
No, I apologize. Yeah.

<i>It was so much fun.</i>

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:46.444
You have no idea, Mom.
We had such an amazing time. It was a blast.

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:50.949
<i>Yeah. Listen, I just wanted to let you know

And I'm gonna do better now.

01:21:59.624 --> 01:22:02.168
I'm gonna be the best I can be.

01:22:14.389 --> 01:22:16.224
That's it, baby.

01:22:16.308 --> 01:22:18.059
Do it just like that.

01:22:18.143 --> 01:22:20.937
Yeah, make it all sparkle.

01:22:21.605 --> 01:22:23.648
Get it squeaky clean for me.

01:23:14.783 --> 01:23:16.743
<i>Seems like a dream.</i>

01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:24.376
<i>Seems like a dream.</i>

01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:33.051
<i>Seems like a dream.</i>

01:24:06.835 --> 01:24:09.337
<i>Yeah, Mom, it was really great.</i>

01:24:09.421 --> 01:24:11.840
<i>I think we found ourselves here.</i>

01:24:11.923 --> 01:24:15.635
<i>We finally got to see
some other parts of the world.</i>

01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:18.221
<i>Yeah, we saw some beautiful things here.</i>

01:24:18.304 --> 01:24:20.348
<i>Things we'll never forget.</i>

01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:22.434
<i>We got to let loose.</i>

01:24:24.269 --> 01:24:27.731
<i>God, I can't believe
how many new friends we made.</i>

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:31.359
<i>Friends from all over the place.
I mean, everyone was so sweet here.</i>

01:24:31.443 --> 01:24:33.653
<i>So warm and friendly.</i>

01:24:34.863 --> 01:24:37.866
<i>I know we made friends
that will last us a lifetime.</i>

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:42.495
<i>We met people who are just like us.</i>

01:24:42.579 --> 01:24:45.081
<i>People just the same as us.</i>

01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:48.626
<i>Everyone was just trying to find themselves.</i>

01:24:49.377 --> 01:24:52.088
<i>It was way more
than just having a good time.</i>

01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:57.135
<i>We're different people now.
We see things differently.</i>

01:24:57.218 --> 01:25:00.597
<i>More colors, more love,
more understanding.</i>

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.350
<i>God, it was so nice to get a break
from reality for a little while.</i>

01:25:04.434 --> 01:25:07.520
<i>I know we have to go back to school, but...</i>

01:25:07.604 --> 01:25:09.898
<i>we'll always remember this trip.</i>

01:25:09.981 --> 01:25:12.275
<i>Something so amazing.</i>

01:25:12.358 --> 01:25:14.235
<i>Magical.</i>

01:25:14.319 --> 01:25:16.988
<i>Something so beautiful.</i>

01:25:18.198 --> 01:25:20.992
<i>Feels as if the world is perfect.</i>

01:25:21.075 --> 01:25:23.203
<i>Like it's never gonna end.</i>

01:26:12.085 --> 01:26:14.128
<i>At night here,
we can see way past the stars.</i>

01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:18.508
<i>We- We can see into the light.
And it's just- It's beautiful.</i>

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:20.760
<i>I never want it to end.</i>

01:26:28.685 --> 01:26:30.979
<i>Spring break forever.</i>

01:26:31.062 --> 01:26:34.065
<i>Spring break forever, bitches.</i>
