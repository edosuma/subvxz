WEBVTT

00:40.465 --> 00:42.234
- All right.
- All right, man.

00:44.904 --> 00:46.806
When I get the hose
into the tank,

00:46.839 --> 00:47.740
you hit the switch.

00:47.774 --> 00:49.274
Here, man.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.952
- All right. Hit that shit.
- All right. For sure.

00:59.986 --> 01:03.723
Ah, damn.

01:03.756 --> 01:07.660
Yo, we're gonna be selling this,
top notch cooking oil

01:07.694 --> 01:10.697
to every mom-and-pop joint
for the next six months.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.597
Pretty damn good, huh?

01:12.632 --> 01:14.701
Yeah, you think
it's gonna last that long?

01:21.007 --> 01:23.575
- Oh, shit. The cops.
- Oh, shit.

01:25.712 --> 01:27.412
- We're good.
- ...not even. We're good.

01:27.446 --> 01:30.615
Whoo. Man, that's close.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.984
Too late to get my heart
jumping like that.

01:32.018 --> 01:33.820
Let's hurry up and shit.

01:33.853 --> 01:34.754
Are we almost done?

01:40.325 --> 01:41.794
Come on, man. We've gotta
get the fuck out of there, man.

01:41.828 --> 01:43.295
You got it?

01:43.328 --> 01:44.396
- Yeah, one more time.
- All right.

01:44.429 --> 01:45.530
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:48.034 --> 01:49.334
Shit, it's cold.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.044
- Yo, man, what hell you doing?
- What the fuck?

01:58.077 --> 01:59.779
Motherfucker. Come on.

01:59.812 --> 02:01.647
Come on, man. I'm not gonna
go to jail tonight.

02:01.681 --> 02:02.949
Come on, baby, be good to Daddy.

02:02.982 --> 02:04.549
Can you steal a Tesla next time?
Shit.

02:15.828 --> 02:19.031
Hey, we just moved into
restaurant distribution, baby,

02:19.065 --> 02:19.966
that's what's up.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.467
Yeah.

02:22.501 --> 02:23.936
That was too close
for my comfort.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.872
Let's celebrate
when we get home, man.

03:09.381 --> 03:11.449
He's just doing his job.
We didn't do nothing.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.384
Just drive.

03:16.022 --> 03:17.355
He's getting behind us,
isn't he?

03:17.389 --> 03:18.456
<i>Pull over to the right</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:19.659
<i>and shut off your vehicle.</i>

03:19.692 --> 03:20.660
Oh, shit.

03:20.693 --> 03:21.593
Come on.

03:25.530 --> 03:26.999
Come on. Haul ass, man.

03:43.783 --> 03:45.017
- Whoa, whoa.
- Shit.

03:53.993 --> 03:55.560
Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

03:56.662 --> 03:57.964
Whoa, shit.

04:12.979 --> 04:14.747
Come on, man. It's gonna blow.

04:14.780 --> 04:15.848
Hurry!

04:20.619 --> 04:22.420
Danny. You all right?
Come on, man.

04:23.923 --> 04:25.992
Come on, man. Good.

04:26.025 --> 04:28.194
Oh, shit. Here come the police.
Come on.

04:30.763 --> 04:31.764
Let's go!

04:41.741 --> 04:45.645
Damn.

04:45.678 --> 04:46.913
Let's get the fuck out of here.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.457
You're a saint, man. Thank you.

04:59.491 --> 05:01.027
All right, man. I gotta
get home to Sara. So.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.962
Whoa. Where you going?
Night's still young.

05:02.995 --> 05:04.897
What's your problem, man?

05:04.931 --> 05:07.099
The night's always young.
For you.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.434
Oh, you say that
like it's a bad thing too.

05:11.704 --> 05:14.206
"And all our yesterdays

05:14.240 --> 05:17.575
have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.577
Out, out, brief candle."

05:20.612 --> 05:21.714
<i>Au revoir.</i>

05:29.789 --> 05:31.223
Ah.

05:31.257 --> 05:32.858
Where's the money?
You got the money?

05:32.892 --> 05:34.093
I've got some money.

06:16.235 --> 06:18.270
<i>The chain
of missing prostitutes continue,</i>

06:18.304 --> 06:20.806
<i>which lead us to believe
it's the same killer.</i>

06:20.840 --> 06:22.775
<i>More news coming.</i>

06:22.808 --> 06:25.177
<i>This just in.
Detroit police report</i>

06:25.211 --> 06:28.914
<i>that another young lady
has been reported missing.</i>

06:28.948 --> 06:31.751
Jesus Christ, Johnny. You smell
like a dumpster's truck

06:31.784 --> 06:34.120
or some cheap-ass party store.

06:34.153 --> 06:37.089
- You look like shit too.
- Well.

06:37.123 --> 06:38.623
More so than usual.

06:51.771 --> 06:53.973
What you waiting for?
An engraved invitation?

06:54.006 --> 06:57.843
I didn't recognize
the new chariot we had tonight.

06:57.877 --> 06:58.778
Yeah.

06:59.712 --> 07:01.013
It's a Blue Stella.

07:01.047 --> 07:02.681
Hey,
real Prince Charming shit, huh?

07:02.715 --> 07:03.581
Uh-huh.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.986
- Lucky me, huh?
- Move that sweet ass.

07:36.982 --> 07:38.884
You watched Andrea and Renee?

07:38.918 --> 07:39.819
No skimming?

07:40.753 --> 07:42.988
They're good girls.

07:43.022 --> 07:46.392
Yes, I watched them like a hawk
just like you taught me.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.326
It's all there.

08:03.843 --> 08:04.910
Danny.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.011
- You like that?
- Yes.

08:06.045 --> 08:08.047
Yeah, take it, baby.

08:22.695 --> 08:24.830
- Oh, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.864 --> 08:25.898
You still got it.

08:25.931 --> 08:27.133
I know I do.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.215
Girls keep disappearing.

08:44.984 --> 08:46.051
Just watch yourself.

08:47.086 --> 08:48.754
I am always...

08:48.787 --> 08:49.955
...careful.

08:50.456 --> 08:51.357
Promise.

08:56.028 --> 08:57.863
I really did get you something.

08:57.897 --> 08:59.865
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

08:59.899 --> 09:01.700
Like you say,
you're Danny's girl.

09:04.103 --> 09:05.871
So, you know, this is...

09:07.173 --> 09:08.908
Like you say,
you're Danny's girl.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.079
What is this?

09:16.215 --> 09:18.017
You're my main girl.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.685
It's official now. That's it.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.454
So, how many
other girls you got?

09:22.488 --> 09:26.192
What? Damn, girl.
"Main" means one. Fuck.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.130
- My lucky Penny. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.964 --> 09:32.865
My main girl.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.401
Let's keep it that way.

09:35.434 --> 09:37.169
I'm just messing with you, okay?

09:37.203 --> 09:38.804
I like it. It's nice.

09:42.074 --> 09:44.510
Plus, it's perfect timing.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.112
- Timing?
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.146 --> 09:48.881
So, I'm your main girl now,
right?

09:48.914 --> 09:51.350
- Your lucky Penny?
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.819
Then you should listen
to my idea for your next job.

09:53.852 --> 09:56.522
Hey, I'm still
running that show.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.058
I know. Listen, but...

09:59.091 --> 10:01.427
Grease isn't really big time.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.829
- You know?
- Big time?

10:03.862 --> 10:06.232
That grease would've been
turned into top-notch,

10:06.265 --> 10:08.834
high-quality cooking oil.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.436
With a little, you know,
hocus-pocus,

10:10.469 --> 10:13.439
- what we call repackaging.
- Okay. Listen. Listen.

10:13.472 --> 10:15.407
There's this new place
on 4th Street.

10:15.441 --> 10:17.776
It's called "Honest Abe's
Pawn Shop."

10:17.810 --> 10:19.912
All the girls go there.
If they get a new watch

10:19.945 --> 10:21.780
- they take it...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:21.814 --> 10:24.950
My main girl, now yeah,
but, you know, rules are rules.

10:24.984 --> 10:26.852
No unnecessary details.

10:28.254 --> 10:30.055
You get popped,
it's likely a cop

10:30.089 --> 10:32.758
looking for a free knob job.
Fucking freeloaders.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.327
I'm the one providing
the goddamned

10:35.361 --> 10:36.829
social service selling, honey.

10:36.862 --> 10:39.498
I know, baby, I know,
but listen.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.001
Anna's saying
it pays good money.

10:42.034 --> 10:45.871
And he's swimming in cash.
He's got gold,

10:45.904 --> 10:48.173
jewelry, coins.

10:48.207 --> 10:52.378
And I think
that you should investigate.

10:53.512 --> 10:54.847
This place?

10:55.481 --> 10:57.283
It's new?

10:57.316 --> 11:00.119
Yeah. It's, like,
three or four months old.

11:00.152 --> 11:01.053
It's new.

11:04.023 --> 11:04.923
Okay.

11:05.924 --> 11:07.559
Okay, baby.

11:11.096 --> 11:12.831
Let's check it out.

11:55.675 --> 11:57.976
<i>I guess
you're Honest Abe.</i>

11:58.010 --> 11:59.411
<i>That's right.</i>

11:59.445 --> 12:00.446
<i>Honest Abe.</i>

12:05.584 --> 12:07.986
I run a clean, honest shop.

12:32.679 --> 12:34.647
Ain't that
like a contradiction?

12:38.317 --> 12:40.552
Contradiction in terms.

12:40.586 --> 12:41.954
Contradiction?

12:43.222 --> 12:44.623
Yeah, you know, like...

12:45.658 --> 12:47.192
One-man team.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.061
Military intelligence.

12:49.094 --> 12:50.496
Business ethics.

12:50.529 --> 12:52.665
It's a good one, huh?

12:52.699 --> 12:54.433
The ho with the golden heart.

12:54.466 --> 12:56.168
Yeah, it's a bit long
and cynical, but, you know.

12:56.201 --> 12:57.269
You get the point?

13:01.507 --> 13:03.275
Wearing tight slacks.

13:06.111 --> 13:07.413
Oh, and,

13:07.446 --> 13:09.415
the biggest
open secret of them all,

13:11.083 --> 13:12.584
the honest pawn broker.

13:14.987 --> 13:16.054
What?

13:16.088 --> 13:18.290
I run a clean, honest shop.

13:18.323 --> 13:19.692
Yeah. Clean,

13:19.726 --> 13:21.059
honest shop.

13:22.161 --> 13:24.263
Plenty of great stuff in here.

13:24.296 --> 13:25.197
Forget it.

13:41.513 --> 13:42.614
Gimme the flashlight.

13:44.016 --> 13:45.517
No, to the left. It's high beam.

13:47.453 --> 13:48.755
Here you go. It's a high beam.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.122
- Like you said.
- Yeah, I know it is.

13:51.323 --> 13:53.091
High fucking beam.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.193
Brighter, the better.

13:55.394 --> 13:56.295
Now then.

13:58.063 --> 13:59.398
That's enough, young fella.

14:05.237 --> 14:06.438
I'm looking for

14:07.439 --> 14:09.308
one honest man.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.422
Okay. I'll be right back
with your change.

14:34.266 --> 14:35.567
Um.

14:35.601 --> 14:37.804
Your change?

14:43.141 --> 14:44.443
What the fuck, man?

14:44.476 --> 14:45.410
You got a problem?

14:47.647 --> 14:49.381
I'm looking for someone.

14:49.414 --> 14:50.717
You ain't him.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.484
You're damn right.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.419
What's his problem?

14:54.453 --> 14:56.522
He's looking for one honest man.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.291
Good fucking luck.

15:01.126 --> 15:02.795
Tara? Need you to cover for me.

15:18.343 --> 15:19.411
You okay, Danny?

15:20.780 --> 15:21.748
You seem...

15:22.649 --> 15:23.549
different.

15:24.884 --> 15:26.285
The flashlight.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.254
Looking for an honest man?

15:32.391 --> 15:33.592
Searching for something.

15:34.661 --> 15:36.763
I don't know. Yeah.

15:37.664 --> 15:38.698
And honest man.

15:59.184 --> 16:00.653
<i>Everyone's got an aura.</i>

16:03.656 --> 16:05.357
- An aura?
- Exactly.

16:07.559 --> 16:10.596
This flashlight picks it up,
it's got

16:12.431 --> 16:15.467
tripped-out, highly sensitive,
multi-pixelated,

16:15.500 --> 16:17.837
hair-trigger sensors with a mix

16:17.870 --> 16:20.272
of digital and analog,
I call it...

16:20.305 --> 16:21.774
Call it digilog.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.142
Digilog?

16:26.278 --> 16:27.613
You sure you're okay?

16:32.652 --> 16:35.420
Hi, there.
Can I help you with anything?

16:35.454 --> 16:37.456
Yeah. Hello.

16:37.489 --> 16:38.858
My grandmother's ring.

16:38.891 --> 16:40.660
She gave it to me.

16:40.693 --> 16:42.561
It's a family heirloom.

16:44.764 --> 16:47.700
- Family is important.
- Mm-hmm.

16:47.734 --> 16:51.136
If you're interested in selling,
I need you to sign.

16:52.672 --> 16:54.239
You have a pen?

16:54.272 --> 16:55.775
Thank you.

16:55.808 --> 16:57.944
All right. Hold on. Hold on.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.178
- This is a raid!
- Oh, fuck.

17:00.212 --> 17:01.413
Oh, goddammit.

17:03.448 --> 17:06.485
Thanks for giving me
a heart attack. I just woke up.

17:06.518 --> 17:08.253
What, like Agent Smith and shit.

17:08.286 --> 17:10.422
- Mm-hmm.
- What're you looking for?

17:10.455 --> 17:13.358
One honest man.
And I'm wasting my time here.

17:13.392 --> 17:14.827
One honest man. Seriously?

17:14.861 --> 17:16.461
All right. Whatever.

17:16.495 --> 17:18.296
Here, give me
a cup of coffee, will you?

17:18.330 --> 17:19.666
Get your own damn coffee.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.942
You know I got to be
your personal PBS,

17:29.976 --> 17:32.310
but look, seriously though, man.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.380
Are you sure you're thinking
these jobs through?

17:35.414 --> 17:37.717
Exactly why I stopped by.
I got something to show you.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.723
Sweetie,
I can only give you $50.

17:44.791 --> 17:45.692
For this?

17:46.659 --> 17:49.528
- Really.
- Really?

17:49.561 --> 17:51.864
It's very pretty,
it's just not very valuable.

17:54.734 --> 17:55.902
Thank you.

17:55.935 --> 17:56.836
You're welcome.

18:26.431 --> 18:28.233
Well, that went well.

18:29.669 --> 18:31.603
What's up, Penny?
Nice to see you.

18:33.072 --> 18:36.241
So, he offered me 50 bucks.

18:36.709 --> 18:37.609
Fifty bucks?

18:38.678 --> 18:40.646
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.050 --> 18:45.651
There you go. It's yours now.

18:47.954 --> 18:49.254
You hear that, Johnny?

18:50.757 --> 18:52.424
Honest Abe.

18:52.457 --> 18:54.493
Being a dealer
in stolen goods himself

18:54.526 --> 18:56.028
ain't reporting shit
to the cops.

18:59.031 --> 19:00.900
He's the perfect victim.
You feel me?

19:02.434 --> 19:04.503
Yeah. I don't know, man.

19:05.537 --> 19:07.339
Baseball cards?

19:07.372 --> 19:10.475
I feel like I'm stealing
my kid brother's piggy bank.

19:10.509 --> 19:13.780
I've stolen piggy banks.
Those 30 cent pieces add up.

19:13.813 --> 19:17.049
Anything, anything, Johnny.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.451
I don't care
if it's dental floss

19:19.484 --> 19:20.953
or toothpicks
or fucking swizzle sticks.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.555
Swizzle sticks?

19:23.588 --> 19:24.824
All right.

19:24.857 --> 19:27.660
Yeah, damn right,
swizzle sticks.

19:27.693 --> 19:29.629
Ear swabs.
Did I mention ear swabs?

19:29.662 --> 19:31.329
I've sold enough ear swabs

19:31.363 --> 19:32.732
to put you up
in the Ritz Carlton

19:32.765 --> 19:33.699
for a fucking month.

19:50.049 --> 19:51.684
Why, you own the goddamn road?

19:56.989 --> 19:58.423
Whoa. Fuck.

20:31.791 --> 20:33.491
Yeah.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.460
You know, I've been trying
to piece it together.

20:37.063 --> 20:38.597
Piece it together?

20:38.631 --> 20:40.800
Bingo. All the missing girls.

20:42.001 --> 20:43.169
You know,

20:43.202 --> 20:44.502
that's all they have.

20:46.005 --> 20:47.673
Look at that guy.
Could be anybody.

20:47.707 --> 20:48.708
Hell, could be you.

20:49.507 --> 20:50.442
Then again,

20:51.110 --> 20:52.444
it could be me.

20:53.179 --> 20:54.579
Pathetic.

20:54.613 --> 20:56.082
Yeah, I'm just passing through.

20:57.616 --> 20:59.185
Bingo. The guy?

20:59.218 --> 21:01.153
The guy in the sketch?
That's what he's doing.

21:01.187 --> 21:03.022
Just passing through.

21:03.055 --> 21:04.556
You know, semi-transient,

21:04.589 --> 21:07.960
yet with means
and assets and money.

21:09.996 --> 21:11.697
Another way I look at it?

21:11.731 --> 21:13.465
Find that guy,

21:13.498 --> 21:15.735
you find somebody who, you know,

21:15.768 --> 21:18.603
when he comes around, he,

21:18.638 --> 21:20.505
makes the girls disappear.

21:20.538 --> 21:23.809
Then when he disappears, then
the girls stop disappearing.

21:23.843 --> 21:25.477
Till he pops back up
in another town.

21:25.510 --> 21:26.913
You know, it's all,
it's all cycle.

21:26.946 --> 21:28.047
That's the guy.

21:37.056 --> 21:38.190
Good theory.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.861
You should tell the authorities.

21:41.894 --> 21:43.896
I have.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.698
You know, you find this pattern

21:45.731 --> 21:47.166
and you find the guy,

21:47.199 --> 21:50.670
but you know, they look at me
like I'm nuts.

21:50.703 --> 21:52.104
They come around here
and sniff around

21:52.138 --> 21:54.106
like it's some
kind of graveyard, you know.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.107
It's highly demeaning.

21:58.543 --> 22:04.116
And this, this thing.
Something else, huh?

22:04.150 --> 22:05.818
Yeah.

22:05.851 --> 22:07.619
Something else. Yeah.

22:09.088 --> 22:11.991
You have papers
on that 80 Camaro out there?

22:12.024 --> 22:14.592
Yeah, I got paper enough
to sell what you want off of it,

22:14.627 --> 22:17.263
but it's a shell. It's junk.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.632
Yeah, I know where I'm at.
Thanks.

22:19.665 --> 22:22.234
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:22.268 --> 22:27.273
I actually had to dispose
of an 80 Camaro recently.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.606
Dispose?

22:29.842 --> 22:32.178
Exigent circumstances
required it.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.184
All right. Yeah,
I get what you mean. Of course.

22:38.217 --> 22:40.152
Yes, sir. I got it.

22:40.820 --> 22:41.721
I think.

22:43.588 --> 22:45.691
Wheels.
A car that moves.

22:45.725 --> 22:46.993
Reliable

22:47.860 --> 22:49.561
vehicle

22:49.594 --> 22:50.830
- required.
- Hello, ladies.

22:50.863 --> 22:51.764
Oh.

22:52.564 --> 22:53.265
Hey, Danny.

22:55.067 --> 22:58.170
- Danny. Hey!
- Hey, how's it going?

22:58.204 --> 23:00.306
Yeah. How many bullies
you sent home

23:00.339 --> 23:01.707
crying to their mamas
this school year?

23:01.741 --> 23:03.142
Oh, ask me how many

23:03.175 --> 23:05.044
I haven't and I'm already done.

23:07.313 --> 23:09.547
You still reading this stuff?

23:09.581 --> 23:12.318
I thought you might've graduated
to the romance section.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.887
Fuck off, Danny,
I'm a collector.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.690
Comics and cards, all right.
Romance is for pussies.

23:18.991 --> 23:20.726
I love this kid.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.195
Taylor. Time for homework.

23:23.229 --> 23:24.230
Yeah, go.

23:25.064 --> 23:25.931
What a mouth.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.339
I gotta get ready for work.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.740
- I'm running a little late.
- Okay.

23:36.175 --> 23:37.843
Bingo.

23:37.877 --> 23:39.245
They're here. Yes, sir.

23:41.814 --> 23:42.715
Yeah.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.154
How much you want for it?

23:48.187 --> 23:49.989
Well,
as you're well aware,

23:50.022 --> 23:53.359
that's a mighty fine automobile
out there. So, you know.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.927
- Make it... a hundred?
- Two.

23:55.895 --> 23:56.996
Yeah, bingo.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.132
That'll work.

24:05.704 --> 24:06.639
Keep it.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.862
Craigslist? We'll get a hit.

24:32.865 --> 24:35.334
An honest getaway driver

24:35.367 --> 24:37.403
- that reads.
- The triple threat.

24:37.436 --> 24:38.838
Yeah.

24:40.673 --> 24:41.373
What of it?

24:43.375 --> 24:44.343
- All right.
- Hey.

24:48.247 --> 24:49.181
We'll find him.

24:50.916 --> 24:52.184
Yeah.

26:36.222 --> 26:38.290
Hey, it was good thinking,
that pawn shop.

26:39.124 --> 26:41.193
We hit it,

26:41.227 --> 26:43.295
lay low,
and get you off the streets.

26:44.196 --> 26:45.130
What do you think?

26:46.932 --> 26:48.767
I think that sounds perfect.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.505
Dreamy.

26:53.539 --> 26:55.441
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.950
Let me see. $46, okay?

27:06.051 --> 27:07.353
What are we talking about?

27:07.386 --> 27:08.988
Trading cards.

27:09.021 --> 27:11.457
Baseball cards, Felix.

27:11.490 --> 27:14.360
Right, right.
You sure about those cards.

27:14.393 --> 27:17.463
I'm talking 1910
tobacco pack type cards.

27:17.496 --> 27:19.898
The Georgia Peach,
meanest player ever.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.368
And 1930s mint condition
Babe Ruths

27:22.401 --> 27:25.137
as well as Lou Gehrigs
and Cy Youngs.

27:25.170 --> 27:28.374
Cy fucking Young.
Don't forget Cy Young.

27:28.407 --> 27:31.243
I don't even think
he knows what he's got.

27:31.277 --> 27:32.544
He doesn't, baby.

27:36.915 --> 27:38.384
Look.

27:38.417 --> 27:40.486
If you're not
gonna lick my asshole,

27:41.453 --> 27:43.155
then jerk me off.

27:43.188 --> 27:45.024
Or I'll just kill you.

27:45.057 --> 27:46.458
It's not fucking funny.

27:46.492 --> 27:49.395
It's a joke. Come on.

27:49.428 --> 27:50.963
A joke, you know.

27:52.431 --> 27:53.866
- A joke.
- Fuck off.

27:53.899 --> 27:55.100
Come on.

27:59.038 --> 27:59.938
Come on.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.943
Come on over here. There we go.

28:05.911 --> 28:07.579
Don't touch my hair.

28:07.613 --> 28:09.348
Oh, yeah.

28:10.115 --> 28:11.050
All right.

28:14.654 --> 28:16.622
Dammit.

28:16.656 --> 28:19.525
Okay. That's what he's got?

28:19.558 --> 28:22.061
I could flip them
for, like, 30% of book.

28:22.094 --> 28:24.396
Dollar signs, Felix,
dollar signs.

28:25.898 --> 28:28.033
Like 150k, easy.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.002
Honest?

28:30.903 --> 28:32.237
Honest.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.698
Man, you look familiar. Carl?

30:10.637 --> 30:12.471
Nice car.

30:12.504 --> 30:15.207
I sure hope you drive better
than you did the last time.

30:21.648 --> 30:24.016
- I got shit to do.
- Hey, hey, lighten up.

30:24.049 --> 30:25.350
Take it easy. Look.

30:25.384 --> 30:28.220
Let's just take
a slow drive, Carl.

30:28.253 --> 30:31.490
If you're still interested
after I explain the, nature

30:31.523 --> 30:33.025
of the driving,

30:33.058 --> 30:35.027
I'll go to step two.
What do you say?

30:37.529 --> 30:38.430
Get in the car.

30:40.232 --> 30:41.133
My man.

30:53.345 --> 30:55.581
You've been there once.
You're a regular.

30:58.317 --> 31:00.185
Just check for the CCTV.

31:00.219 --> 31:01.487
- The gun.
- Mm-hmm.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.655
And all the regular.

31:03.589 --> 31:05.157
- I will.
- All right.

31:26.578 --> 31:28.180
All right, MacGyver.

31:28.213 --> 31:30.315
Take a right
at this corner here.

31:30.349 --> 31:33.185
You can go all the way down
and you'll see a donut shop.

31:33.218 --> 31:34.586
AJ's Donuts.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.521
Pull in there.

31:41.226 --> 31:42.127
Shakespeare.

31:44.463 --> 31:46.231
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hmm.

31:46.265 --> 31:47.299
Better question.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.568
Who are you?

31:49.601 --> 31:50.670
Who are you?

31:52.538 --> 31:53.773
You're about to find out.

32:02.447 --> 32:03.382
Hello?

32:05.217 --> 32:06.753
Anybody here?

32:06.786 --> 32:08.387
Back so soon, Penny?

32:10.723 --> 32:12.457
How do you know my name?

32:12.491 --> 32:14.459
Sweetheart,
you've written it down

32:14.493 --> 32:16.629
a half-dozen times
in the last week.

32:19.899 --> 32:21.066
Not today.

32:23.268 --> 32:24.603
Let's take a look.

32:40.185 --> 32:42.722
All right. Just sit tight.

32:42.755 --> 32:45.190
You can read the book,
but don't lose my spot.

32:47.359 --> 32:48.260
Keep her running.

33:06.511 --> 33:09.181
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Please, don't shoot.

33:09.214 --> 33:11.918
I'll give you whatever you want.
Please, take it, take it.

33:11.951 --> 33:13.452
Dial 911!

33:19.558 --> 33:20.459
Drive!

33:26.498 --> 33:28.367
Fake.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.502
- No.
- It's a fake, sweetie.

33:30.535 --> 33:32.705
There's a lot
of knock-offs out there.

33:32.739 --> 33:33.740
Can you look again?

33:34.539 --> 33:35.875
Sure, but...

33:38.678 --> 33:40.212
It's really a fake.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.823
You work with those girls
couple of blocks up, right?

33:50.857 --> 33:52.825
- Mm-hmm.
- Day and night?

33:55.227 --> 33:57.930
That's no place
for a girl like you.

33:57.964 --> 33:59.932
You're just a kid.

33:59.966 --> 34:02.334
I can take care of myself.

34:02.367 --> 34:04.536
- Until you can't.
- Yeah.

34:06.639 --> 34:08.875
And tell your boyfriend

34:08.908 --> 34:11.778
he's been loitering outside
an awful lot this week.

34:13.012 --> 34:14.647
I don't like it.

34:14.681 --> 34:15.915
It makes me nervous.

35:27.486 --> 35:29.354
Fucking sims never had a chance.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.793
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

35:33.826 --> 35:35.327
Close call, huh?

35:35.360 --> 35:37.395
I mean, wow.

35:43.870 --> 35:46.706
Yo, did we just boost
a fucking donut shop?

35:46.739 --> 35:48.040
Not just any donuts.

35:48.074 --> 35:49.909
AJ's Donuts.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.576
Best in the deep.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.045
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

35:56.015 --> 35:58.050
- Ooh, shit.
- So where did you meet, um,

35:58.084 --> 35:59.752
Mr. Hot Rod Fuck You guy again?

36:01.020 --> 36:03.321
Carl. His name is Carl.

36:03.355 --> 36:04.623
And I met him at the bus stop.

36:05.725 --> 36:07.459
He reads a bit.

36:07.492 --> 36:08.895
Might even be that triple threat

36:08.928 --> 36:10.529
that you talked about.

36:11.429 --> 36:12.397
Speaking of which.

36:15.367 --> 36:16.669
- That's you.
- Oh, yeah.

36:18.370 --> 36:19.604
- My kind of girl.
- Coffee?

36:20.505 --> 36:21.406
Good.

36:24.376 --> 36:25.310
Carlson.

36:28.915 --> 36:31.483
Johnny took you on a little tour
of our lovely little city here

36:31.516 --> 36:34.053
and you did well, otherwise
you wouldn't be here. But.

36:38.590 --> 36:39.892
Do you lose your cool
when it looks like

36:39.926 --> 36:41.060
you're totally boxed in?

36:43.663 --> 36:45.597
There's no such thing

36:45.631 --> 36:46.732
as being boxed in.

36:47.934 --> 36:50.703
And what the fuck is that thing?

36:50.736 --> 36:54.439
Yeah, he's looking
for one honest man or whatever.

36:56.108 --> 36:57.810
Oh, yeah.

36:57.844 --> 36:59.611
Yeah, I remember. "Honest."

37:01.479 --> 37:03.149
I thought
that was a fucking joke.

37:03.182 --> 37:05.084
Yeah, me too.

37:05.117 --> 37:07.920
But, now that you're here.

37:07.954 --> 37:11.489
Step three.
Third and final step.

37:11.523 --> 37:14.426
Slightest change
in body temperature,

37:14.459 --> 37:16.996
heartbeat, sweat,

37:17.029 --> 37:19.999
and you're busted, Carl. Got it?

37:20.032 --> 37:23.736
It's physics. Nuclear physics,
fiber optics, and so forth.

37:23.769 --> 37:25.437
- Physics?
- Exactly.

37:25.470 --> 37:28.440
Physics. Nuclear
fucking physics, speed racer.

37:28.473 --> 37:30.776
Everything and everyone
has an aura.

37:30.810 --> 37:32.444
And this?

37:32.477 --> 37:33.478
It senses it.

37:34.814 --> 37:37.183
And yours is fucked up, Carl.

37:37.216 --> 37:39.085
It's exceedingly fucked up.

37:40.186 --> 37:41.787
Hmm.

37:41.821 --> 37:44.123
I appreciate the...

37:44.156 --> 37:46.626
searing recommendation.

37:48.194 --> 37:49.762
Hey, it's the flashlight.

37:49.795 --> 37:51.596
I'm just the guy
reading the x-ray.

37:53.132 --> 37:54.599
So I got a fucked up aura.

37:55.201 --> 37:56.102
Okay.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.504
Look.

37:59.537 --> 38:00.940
If you need a getaway driver,

38:01.874 --> 38:03.075
I'm right fucking here.

38:10.249 --> 38:12.617
I'm gonna hit the head.

38:12.652 --> 38:15.587
Maybe I'll work on that,
that fucked up aura.

38:17.857 --> 38:19.424
Take more than a car wash.

38:22.128 --> 38:23.029
Hey, stuntman.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.565
What do you think, Shakespeare?

38:27.599 --> 38:29.001
Hey, man.

38:29.035 --> 38:30.502
We're looking
for a getaway driver.

38:30.535 --> 38:31.904
Yeah, I'm sure.

38:31.938 --> 38:36.541
- Should've seen him.
- Yeah, but is he honest?

38:36.574 --> 38:39.611
Well, unfortunately, I left
my own magic flashlight at home.

38:47.253 --> 38:50.056
Okay. Okay, Johnny.
Let's review one more time.

38:53.292 --> 38:55.795
<i>Mr. Honest Abe
with the fucked up comb-over</i>

38:55.828 --> 38:58.798
<i>has at least half a mil
in baseball cards.</i>

39:00.132 --> 39:02.201
<i>With one CCTV</i>

39:02.234 --> 39:04.270
<i>and no security.
Penny cased the joint.</i>

39:04.303 --> 39:06.138
<i>We're in, we're out.</i>

39:07.773 --> 39:10.242
500k in baseball...

39:10.276 --> 39:11.777
Baseball cards?

39:11.811 --> 39:14.080
Not just any
baseball cards, Johnny.

39:14.113 --> 39:16.782
1910 tobacco pack type cards.

39:16.816 --> 39:19.051
1930 mint-condition Babe Ruths.

39:19.085 --> 39:21.153
Lou Gehrig, the Iron Man, right?

39:21.187 --> 39:24.690
Lou fucking Gehrig. Oh.
And Cy Young.

39:24.724 --> 39:27.193
Cy fucking Young.
I almost forgot Cy Young.

39:27.226 --> 39:29.962
Yeah, no, 500k.

39:29.996 --> 39:32.530
No doubt, easy. And our take,

39:32.564 --> 39:34.599
150k. I already talked to Felix.

39:35.835 --> 39:37.770
Are you shitting me?

39:37.803 --> 39:39.805
Okay, man, shit, let's do this.

39:39.839 --> 39:42.241
- That's my partner.
- He's gonna come through, man.

39:42.274 --> 39:44.110
- I believe in you.
- All right.

39:44.143 --> 39:46.779
Okay. Okay. So I'm thinking,

39:46.812 --> 39:48.681
you know, just thinking,

39:48.714 --> 39:50.783
since Mr. Fuck You guy
has your vote,

39:50.816 --> 39:53.919
I'm gonna overlook
his fucked up aura.

39:53.953 --> 39:55.721
Maybe he can have
a fucked up aura

39:55.755 --> 39:57.656
and still be honest.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.158
They're not mutually exclusive.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.696
Just like a guy
with a limp may steal.

40:03.729 --> 40:05.097
Outrun the wind, baby.

40:11.003 --> 40:12.570
Can I get you anything else?

40:12.604 --> 40:14.106
No, baby, that's it.
We're about ready to go.

40:14.140 --> 40:15.775
- See you later at home.
- All right, baby.

40:17.609 --> 40:19.611
Perfect timing.

40:19.645 --> 40:22.048
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah.

40:22.081 --> 40:24.750
Yeah.
And you're driving, speed racer.

40:24.784 --> 40:26.786
<i>Another
young lady has been</i>

40:26.819 --> 40:29.655
<i>reported missing. A special
task force has been assembled.</i>

40:47.306 --> 40:49.108
It takes some cocksucker.

40:53.145 --> 40:54.213
Chill the fuck out.

40:59.718 --> 41:00.753
See this shit?

41:02.021 --> 41:03.856
He's in a hurry. So what?

41:03.889 --> 41:05.825
Pedestrians
got the right of way.

41:05.858 --> 41:08.928
It's fucking basic decency.
Get this motherfucker, Carl.

41:12.264 --> 41:15.701
Yeah, Mr. Death Wish,
driving over pedestrians,

41:15.734 --> 41:16.802
trying to lose us.

41:17.703 --> 41:19.271
Man. Get this guy.

41:20.873 --> 41:21.807
Fuck that.

41:31.016 --> 41:32.351
- Let's go.
- What's up, Timberlake?

41:32.384 --> 41:34.286
- You want some?
- Oh, ball player, huh?

41:34.320 --> 41:36.055
Me too.

41:36.088 --> 41:38.023
Pedestrians
got the right of way.

41:38.057 --> 41:40.126
- Get the fuck off me.
- Pedestrians!

41:41.760 --> 41:44.763
Learn the fucking rules.

41:44.797 --> 41:46.966
What are you?
Some sort of serial killer?

41:46.999 --> 41:48.968
Maybe. Most likely.

41:49.001 --> 41:51.871
Pedestrians got the right of way
in this town, fuckface.

41:53.839 --> 41:54.974
It's a nice bat though.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.882
Now, let's go.

42:14.293 --> 42:16.729
All right.
You keep her running, Carl.

42:16.762 --> 42:17.897
In and out, fast.

42:17.930 --> 42:19.698
Johnny, let's go.

42:19.732 --> 42:20.666
You got it.

42:21.767 --> 42:22.668
Make it fast.

42:44.924 --> 42:46.258
Get out here.

42:46.292 --> 42:47.493
Out front.

42:47.526 --> 42:48.827
Let's go.

42:48.861 --> 42:50.262
Move it, motherfucker.

42:52.965 --> 42:54.400
Get your honest ass over here.

43:08.214 --> 43:09.114
Get 'em all.

43:12.851 --> 43:13.953
I just opened.

43:13.986 --> 43:15.521
There's only $50
in the register.

43:15.554 --> 43:16.989
Then I'll take it.

43:17.957 --> 43:18.924
No.

43:23.195 --> 43:24.797
Come on, Shakespeare.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.068
No.

43:29.101 --> 43:31.170
My father collected those.

43:31.203 --> 43:33.472
Those cards are my babies.

43:33.505 --> 43:37.076
Yeah, well, I admire
your father's dedication.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.451
I got 'em all. Let's go.

43:49.521 --> 43:51.523
Fuck.

43:51.557 --> 43:53.092
What are we? Cop magnets?

43:55.861 --> 43:59.498
Please give me back
my baseball cards.

43:59.531 --> 44:01.300
Bitch, shut the fuck up.

44:03.002 --> 44:05.371
Take anything!

44:05.404 --> 44:08.440
- Take anything.
- Shut the fuck up.

44:08.474 --> 44:10.943
They belonged to my daddy.

44:12.311 --> 44:13.979
Come on, please.

44:14.013 --> 44:16.015
- Please.
- All right. Let's go. Let's go.

45:13.472 --> 45:16.308
Hey, didn't we get a report
about a stolen black Camaro?

45:16.342 --> 45:17.276
Sure did.

45:19.211 --> 45:20.479
Yep, let's go.

45:20.512 --> 45:22.081
What the fuck
is he talking about?

45:22.114 --> 45:23.982
- Keep the mask on.
- What's up with that?

45:24.016 --> 45:25.317
Good job, though. For real.

45:31.523 --> 45:33.459
Cops right up on us.

45:33.492 --> 45:35.394
Over baseball cards?

45:35.427 --> 45:36.929
Somebody shoot me.

45:37.930 --> 45:39.398
That life is short.

45:39.431 --> 45:41.367
Shame will be too long.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.469
They're vintage baseball cards.

45:43.502 --> 45:46.572
Calm down there, Shakespeare.
They're vintage baseball cards.

45:46.605 --> 45:47.640
Big difference.

45:48.708 --> 45:50.943
Well, the plates are legit.

45:50.976 --> 45:52.478
Let's check 'em out.

45:52.511 --> 45:55.414
There's a black 80 Camaro.

45:55.447 --> 45:56.548
What are the odds?

45:56.582 --> 45:59.017
Just a routine patrol, fellows.

45:59.051 --> 46:01.587
Routine patrol.
Stay calm. Stay cool.

46:03.389 --> 46:06.358
<i>Pull over to the right
and shut off your vehicle.</i>

46:06.392 --> 46:08.026
Here we go again.

46:08.060 --> 46:10.295
We are jinxed, Danny.
We are jinxed!

46:11.731 --> 46:14.400
Somebody shoot me.

46:15.601 --> 46:17.302
Do your thing, speed racer.

46:20.572 --> 46:22.007
Go, go, go, go!

46:39.158 --> 46:40.926
Don't lose him, don't lose him.

47:14.159 --> 47:16.161
Move! Get out of the car!

48:29.468 --> 48:30.569
You're out.

48:42.180 --> 48:43.448
Might wanna watch your eyes.

48:48.821 --> 48:50.690
Goddammit, I liked that car.

48:54.526 --> 48:56.629
Your cut will get you
a new car, Carl.

49:27.727 --> 49:28.628
Daddy.

49:58.190 --> 50:00.793
Sweetie. Sweetie. Penny.

50:18.878 --> 50:20.445
Sweet Penny.

50:22.882 --> 50:24.282
You saved our ass there.

50:28.821 --> 50:30.288
Guess that means I own it.

50:33.793 --> 50:35.494
He said he owns your ass.

50:35.527 --> 50:38.296
Yeah, you try and say
one nice thing to the guy.

50:38.330 --> 50:39.398
Forget him. Look.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.302
I'm holding on to the cards
until you touch base with Felix.

50:44.336 --> 50:45.772
Which you're about to do.

50:45.805 --> 50:46.706
Tomorrow.

50:47.907 --> 50:49.508
Tonight...

50:49.541 --> 50:50.877
I celebrate with my lady.

50:50.910 --> 50:52.845
I know that's right.
See you, brother.

50:59.852 --> 51:02.354
Let's take these shoes off
for you.

51:05.590 --> 51:06.525
Hmm.

51:26.411 --> 51:27.980
Sweet Penny.

51:38.658 --> 51:41.493
You're all wrapped up
like a gift,

51:41.526 --> 51:43.763
Sweet Penny, huh?

51:58.978 --> 52:00.913
Smile pretty.

52:09.655 --> 52:11.924
You're going
in the hall of fame.

52:26.371 --> 52:28.373
Pretty Penny.

52:28.406 --> 52:30.375
Why did you lie to me?

52:30.408 --> 52:31.711
Pretty Penny.

52:32.979 --> 52:34.714
Why did you do this, friend?

52:37.717 --> 52:38.918
Where am I?

52:40.385 --> 52:42.922
You're... in big trouble.

52:44.924 --> 52:47.093
You're in my hall of fame

52:47.126 --> 52:50.062
and that's not
a good place to be.

52:50.096 --> 52:52.932
Penny, baby.

52:52.965 --> 52:54.499
Where you at?
I checked in with the girls,

52:54.533 --> 52:55.835
they didn't know where you were.

52:55.868 --> 52:59.538
Fucking worked.
I-It worked, like...

52:59.571 --> 53:01.439
Get your ass here.
Call me back. We're going...

53:04.110 --> 53:05.878
My shut up machine.

53:07.579 --> 53:09.048
Hmm. Hmm.

53:10.149 --> 53:11.316
Hmm.

53:14.687 --> 53:16.055
Motherfucker!

53:33.873 --> 53:34.874
No!

53:46.451 --> 53:48.120
Oh. Oh.

54:08.140 --> 54:09.441
Help!

54:11.443 --> 54:12.510
Help!

54:19.719 --> 54:20.853
Penny,

54:20.887 --> 54:22.722
answer your damn fucking phone.

54:22.755 --> 54:24.924
What the fuck?
Where the fuck are you?

54:31.063 --> 54:32.397
Where am I?

54:33.633 --> 54:36.068
Abe's honest shop.

54:39.604 --> 54:40.806
Wake up, sweetie.

54:42.574 --> 54:45.711
Why did you make me
push you into that wall?

54:46.779 --> 54:48.613
Huh?

54:48.648 --> 54:51.717
Why didn't you cooperate
with Honest Abe?

54:55.021 --> 54:56.022
There you go.

54:56.055 --> 54:57.990
Open those pretty eyes.

55:00.159 --> 55:03.195
Open those pretty eyes,
pretty Penny.

55:08.034 --> 55:09.735
Check this bat out, Penny.

55:11.237 --> 55:13.940
This is the bat Babe Ruth used

55:13.973 --> 55:16.876
when he hit his famous
called shot in 1932.

55:18.277 --> 55:20.780
He stepped up to the plate,

55:20.813 --> 55:22.782
pointed it dead center field,

55:24.050 --> 55:26.451
and next pitch, bam!

55:27.585 --> 55:28.620
Air mail.

55:30.022 --> 55:31.757
My father loved the Babe.

55:33.759 --> 55:35.493
Wake up, sweetie.

55:35.527 --> 55:38.064
You don't wanna miss
any of this baseball history.

55:38.097 --> 55:40.565
I thought you could
take care of yourself.

55:41.033 --> 55:42.935
Huh?

55:42.969 --> 55:47.807
But now? Now you get to join
my private collection.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.242
My own personal hall of fame.

55:51.576 --> 55:53.012
Yeah.

55:53.045 --> 55:54.847
Do you know why?

55:54.880 --> 55:59.251
Do you know why you get to join
my personal hall of fame?

55:59.285 --> 56:02.755
'Cause you and your boyfriend
stole my cards!

56:06.726 --> 56:08.160
My daddy's cards.

56:11.998 --> 56:14.133
Don't play games with me, bitch!

56:21.073 --> 56:23.175
You're built just like Thompson.

56:24.110 --> 56:26.779
Lean, sinewy.

56:26.812 --> 56:28.214
A born ball player.

56:30.182 --> 56:32.051
You would've made the majors.

56:32.084 --> 56:33.719
We both know it.

56:33.753 --> 56:34.954
Don't we?

56:36.188 --> 56:39.759
But my bitch mother
wore you down.

56:42.194 --> 56:44.163
Get a job.

56:44.196 --> 56:46.564
Get a job.

56:46.598 --> 56:49.001
I'll be damned
if I'm standing there

56:49.035 --> 56:52.938
like some loser fucking
wannabe ball player.

56:56.175 --> 56:58.711
I know, Daddy, I know.

57:02.381 --> 57:04.283
You would've made the majors.

57:04.316 --> 57:06.584
We both know it.

57:06.618 --> 57:08.788
But she sucked the life
out of you.

57:08.821 --> 57:11.924
With that vicious fucking
dung of earth.

57:12.958 --> 57:15.127
But don't worry, Daddy.

57:15.161 --> 57:17.296
I've been
shutting that bitch up,

57:19.131 --> 57:20.598
permanently!

57:29.175 --> 57:31.210
Went like clockwork.

57:31.243 --> 57:33.646
- Clockwork?
- Mm-hmm.

57:33.679 --> 57:35.281
I gotta take a shower now. Hey!

57:35.314 --> 57:36.916
- Don't touch that.
- Bitch.

57:38.818 --> 57:40.920
Anyway. Yes.

57:40.953 --> 57:42.988
One, two weeks tops.

57:43.022 --> 57:45.658
And you get to take a break
and focus for real.

57:46.859 --> 57:47.993
Studying.

57:48.027 --> 57:49.028
No more studying.

57:49.061 --> 57:49.995
You're going out.

57:50.863 --> 57:52.131
I'm serious.

57:52.164 --> 57:54.233
- For real?
- Yes. Real, for real.

57:57.870 --> 57:59.138
Taylor.

57:59.171 --> 58:00.706
Dinner's in the kitchen.

58:00.739 --> 58:02.741
- Help yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

58:02.775 --> 58:03.709
Mind your manners.

58:11.750 --> 58:14.420
So aggressive. What's gotten
into you? What's up?

58:14.453 --> 58:16.355
- What you want?
- Take your pants off.

58:16.388 --> 58:17.957
Make me take my pants off.

58:17.990 --> 58:19.925
- Damn. Why... Shit.
- Take your pants off.

58:22.761 --> 58:24.296
What's gotten into you?
What's up?

58:29.802 --> 58:32.204
Damn, girl.
What's gotten into you?

58:32.238 --> 58:34.640
No, we ain't gonna do nothing.
Let's just go cuddle. I'm good.

58:37.176 --> 58:38.077
Wait a minute.

58:39.411 --> 58:41.113
Take your wig off.

58:41.147 --> 58:42.681
You don't need it.

58:42.715 --> 58:43.849
You're beautiful, baby.

58:50.823 --> 58:51.757
There's my girl.

58:57.129 --> 58:58.230
Let me spank your ass.

58:59.732 --> 59:00.466
What?

59:00.499 --> 59:02.801
Let me spank your ass.

59:02.835 --> 59:04.737
- All right. Come on.
- Wanna get the Crisco?

59:04.770 --> 59:07.006
- No. Come on.
- You like cooking oil here?

59:07.039 --> 59:08.073
Now you gotta...

59:33.032 --> 59:34.366
See this spot right here?

59:35.968 --> 59:38.337
That's Tiffany.

59:38.370 --> 59:40.406
- Tiffany?
- Yeah, that's right.

59:41.440 --> 59:43.809
Tiffany. Uh-huh.

59:43.842 --> 59:44.810
Tiffany.

59:46.045 --> 59:47.346
And this spot right here?

59:49.014 --> 59:50.482
This was Emily.

59:50.516 --> 59:53.085
Little, sweet Emily.

59:59.191 --> 1:00:00.893
And this spot right here?

1:00:00.926 --> 1:00:03.162
This is Diane.

1:00:03.195 --> 1:00:06.999
Sweet, little, naive Diane.

1:00:07.032 --> 1:00:08.400
Kind of like you, Penny.

1:00:09.902 --> 1:00:13.939
You said we can go home.

1:00:13.973 --> 1:00:15.174
You can go home.

1:00:16.308 --> 1:00:17.409
Straight to hell!

1:00:18.477 --> 1:00:19.378
Unless...

1:00:22.348 --> 1:00:24.550
Unless what?

1:00:24.583 --> 1:00:27.820
Unless,
unless I get my cards back.

1:00:29.054 --> 1:00:30.789
My daddy's cards.

1:00:32.258 --> 1:00:36.895
I... I don't know anything
about those cards.

1:00:38.063 --> 1:00:39.898
Don't play games with me, bitch!

1:00:40.566 --> 1:00:41.467
Please.

1:00:42.901 --> 1:00:46.305
I'm nobody, mister, I'm nobody.

1:00:46.338 --> 1:00:48.007
Please don't kill me.

1:00:58.917 --> 1:01:00.552
Felix. Felix.

1:01:02.488 --> 1:01:03.989
Making me nervous.

1:01:06.225 --> 1:01:07.159
Sorry.

1:01:09.228 --> 1:01:11.430
Delayed by this asshole
trying to sell me

1:01:11.463 --> 1:01:14.233
a bum transistor radio
and some binoculars.

1:01:16.235 --> 1:01:18.370
Heard you ran into
a little trouble.

1:01:18.404 --> 1:01:19.571
Ah, nothing major.

1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:23.809
And the cards?

1:01:42.027 --> 1:01:43.295
Oh, beautiful.

1:01:45.097 --> 1:01:46.432
Oh, wow.

1:01:49.601 --> 1:01:51.236
Man, oh man, oh man.

1:01:52.971 --> 1:01:55.207
Wow. You know,
I'm still surprised

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:57.609
you found a collection like this
all in one spot.

1:01:59.278 --> 1:02:00.446
Good job, Danny.

1:02:02.381 --> 1:02:03.549
As always.

1:02:06.418 --> 1:02:07.519
Fifteen thousand.

1:02:10.989 --> 1:02:14.426
Do you mean 150,000?

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:17.596
- 'Cause that was our deal.
- Not no more.

1:02:19.431 --> 1:02:22.368
When you rob from a guy

1:02:22.401 --> 1:02:25.672
that turns out
to be certifiable,

1:02:25.705 --> 1:02:29.174
all prior deals
become null and void.

1:02:31.276 --> 1:02:33.078
A law school grad
taught me that.

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:36.915
Would you like a menu?

1:02:36.949 --> 1:02:38.584
No need.
I always know what I want.

1:02:38.617 --> 1:02:40.953
Okay. What can I get for you?

1:02:40.986 --> 1:02:43.188
Spaghetti with meatballs.

1:02:43.222 --> 1:02:44.523
Extra meatballs.

1:02:44.556 --> 1:02:46.191
Double order garlic bread.

1:02:47.159 --> 1:02:49.461
Salad, extra onions.

1:02:49.495 --> 1:02:53.365
Italian dressing, heavy.
And coffee. Black.

1:02:53.399 --> 1:02:56.068
- Okay.
- Aren't you...

1:02:56.101 --> 1:02:57.469
Aren't you gonna
order something?

1:02:58.537 --> 1:03:00.272
No, just coffee.

1:03:00.305 --> 1:03:01.573
Okay. That'll be right up.

1:03:06.445 --> 1:03:08.247
You know, lately when I look
at you, it's like I think

1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:11.350
a famine's gripped the nation
or something, huh?

1:03:11.383 --> 1:03:13.619
You know, when I look at you
I think I know who caused it.

1:03:18.524 --> 1:03:20.526
Touché, Danny, touché. Huh.

1:03:20.559 --> 1:03:22.961
What's with this
"null and void" bullshit?

1:03:27.099 --> 1:03:28.267
Your pawn broker,

1:03:29.101 --> 1:03:30.637
Honest Abe,

1:03:33.338 --> 1:03:35.140
he's out there, man.

1:03:35.174 --> 1:03:36.676
I mean, wacko.

1:03:36.709 --> 1:03:39.278
I mean,
like off the reservation.

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:43.048
Over the rainbow, man.

1:03:43.081 --> 1:03:44.483
I don't do crazy. All right?

1:03:46.185 --> 1:03:48.454
Can't even believe
I'm offering 15k for this.

1:03:57.062 --> 1:03:58.130
You met

1:03:59.131 --> 1:04:00.466
with Abe.

1:04:00.499 --> 1:04:01.768
Get this.

1:04:01.801 --> 1:04:03.402
The cards?

1:04:03.435 --> 1:04:05.370
They were a gift
from his father.

1:04:05.404 --> 1:04:07.139
Huh?

1:04:07.172 --> 1:04:09.676
Here's the best part.
They weren't even for sale.

1:04:10.476 --> 1:04:12.244
All right? Yeah.

1:04:12.277 --> 1:04:16.348
See, Abe says
they're irreplaceable.

1:04:16.381 --> 1:04:18.617
It's as if you stole
the Holy Grail, Danny.

1:04:19.384 --> 1:04:21.386
All right?

1:04:21.420 --> 1:04:23.255
Naturally, I don't get it,
you know.

1:04:23.288 --> 1:04:26.592
So I say to Abe,
"Why? Why, Abe?"

1:04:26.626 --> 1:04:30.596
"Why would you put something
that you cherish

1:04:30.630 --> 1:04:32.431
in a fucking pawn shop?"

1:04:39.505 --> 1:04:40.707
What did he say?

1:04:40.740 --> 1:04:42.241
He likes looking at 'em!

1:04:47.613 --> 1:04:49.749
Fucking hey, I should, ooh.

1:04:49.782 --> 1:04:52.752
Boy, you know
how to pick 'em, Danny.

1:04:52.785 --> 1:04:55.220
No telling how long
I've got to sit on these cards

1:04:55.254 --> 1:04:57.456
to safely move them. See? Huh?

1:04:58.257 --> 1:04:59.191
Time.

1:05:00.259 --> 1:05:02.294
Time is money, Danny. Huh?

1:05:06.532 --> 1:05:07.432
Here we go.

1:05:09.101 --> 1:05:11.436
Anything else for you gentlemen?

1:05:11.470 --> 1:05:13.740
- It's good for now, eh.
- More coffee?

1:05:13.773 --> 1:05:14.707
No, thanks.

1:05:20.713 --> 1:05:23.282
What, I got to vouch
for the mental health

1:05:24.751 --> 1:05:27.553
of every punk I boost now?
New rule?

1:05:29.588 --> 1:05:31.290
Rough job.

1:05:31.323 --> 1:05:32.491
Being a thief.

1:05:35.561 --> 1:05:37.596
What's with the new toy, Danny?

1:05:37.630 --> 1:05:40.299
I'm looking for someone
and you're not him.

1:05:40.332 --> 1:05:42.367
Good. Can I get back
to eating now?

1:05:42.401 --> 1:05:44.403
Wha... You kill somebody lately

1:05:44.436 --> 1:05:45.738
or what? Like what?
You can't sleep?

1:05:45.772 --> 1:05:47.339
Something eating
at your conscience,

1:05:47.372 --> 1:05:49.308
as small as it is?
Why are you giving me

1:05:49.341 --> 1:05:50.542
such a hard time?

1:05:50.576 --> 1:05:52.611
No more bullshit
about Honest Abe

1:05:52.645 --> 1:05:54.881
the psychopathic pawn broker
with a fucked up comb-over.

1:05:54.914 --> 1:05:56.315
I'm not buying it, okay?

1:05:57.650 --> 1:05:59.652
You still don't know
half of it, do you?

1:06:01.386 --> 1:06:03.823
That is one fucked up
comb-over though.

1:06:03.856 --> 1:06:04.757
I'll give you that.

1:06:05.925 --> 1:06:06.826
You know,

1:06:07.727 --> 1:06:09.127
you know, sleep,

1:06:10.663 --> 1:06:13.599
sleep knits up
the raveled sleeve of care.

1:06:15.768 --> 1:06:18.170
- Huh, Felix?
- Danny.

1:06:18.203 --> 1:06:20.673
Sleep knits up
the raveled sleeve of care.

1:06:20.707 --> 1:06:21.808
It's Shakespeare.

1:06:22.709 --> 1:06:24.543
Old Billy Shakes.

1:06:24.576 --> 1:06:25.778
Willy the Shakespeare.

1:06:28.447 --> 1:06:29.381
Wow.

1:06:33.485 --> 1:06:35.354
All right. I see.

1:06:38.490 --> 1:06:40.525
So, to answer your question.

1:06:41.493 --> 1:06:42.862
No.

1:06:42.895 --> 1:06:44.897
I haven't killed anyone, Danny.

1:06:45.765 --> 1:06:46.799
Not lately.

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:49.802
Glad we cleared that up.

1:06:57.710 --> 1:07:00.412
Abe did give me a message to...

1:07:02.314 --> 1:07:03.683
pass along to you.

1:07:10.790 --> 1:07:12.792
Seems that you and I
are at an impasse.

1:07:16.395 --> 1:07:18.330
So...

1:07:18.363 --> 1:07:20.700
You give Abe back his cards,

1:07:20.733 --> 1:07:22.567
he's willing
to let the whole thing slide.

1:07:22.601 --> 1:07:25.270
I'll give 'em back. What am I,
a charitable organization?

1:07:28.675 --> 1:07:30.342
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

1:07:38.851 --> 1:07:39.952
Figure it out, huh?

1:09:31.998 --> 1:09:33.900
Where the fuck are you?

1:09:33.933 --> 1:09:36.702
Where the fuck are you,
motherfucker?

1:09:39.772 --> 1:09:41.573
Abe!

1:09:41.606 --> 1:09:43.408
Abe!

1:09:43.441 --> 1:09:44.811
Come out, you fucker!

1:09:45.610 --> 1:09:46.779
Hey, buddy!

1:09:52.985 --> 1:09:56.354
Get the fuck out here,
you sick motherfucker!

1:09:57.890 --> 1:09:59.558
You fucking...

1:10:01.593 --> 1:10:02.494
Come on.

1:10:06.464 --> 1:10:08.868
Johnny. Johnny.

1:10:08.901 --> 1:10:10.102
Johnny, it's bad.

1:10:11.704 --> 1:10:13.039
It's bad.

1:10:13.072 --> 1:10:14.707
It's bad.

1:10:14.740 --> 1:10:18.376
No, Felix. Felix snitched,
the motherfucker.

1:10:18.410 --> 1:10:20.345
He snitched, the motherfucker.

1:10:21.948 --> 1:10:23.783
I came here to fucking kill him.

1:10:23.816 --> 1:10:26.052
I'm gonna fucking kill him
the way he killed...

1:10:28.087 --> 1:10:28.988
He killed...

1:10:35.594 --> 1:10:37.663
He killed Penny!

1:10:47.139 --> 1:10:50.743
- Hey, Danny. What's up?
- Hey, little boy.

1:10:50.776 --> 1:10:53.679
<i>This just in.
Detroit police report</i>

1:10:53.713 --> 1:10:56.782
<i>that another young lady
has been reported missing.</i>

1:10:56.816 --> 1:10:58.617
<i>A special task force has been...</i>

1:10:58.651 --> 1:11:01.453
- Where's Sara?
- She's working.

1:11:01.486 --> 1:11:03.923
But I told her to be careful.

1:11:03.956 --> 1:11:05.658
All right.
Here's what I need you to do.

1:11:05.691 --> 1:11:07.093
We'll be back in a bit.

1:11:07.126 --> 1:11:08.961
Stay in the house, doors locked.

1:11:08.995 --> 1:11:10.897
Don't answer for anybody,
except me,

1:11:10.930 --> 1:11:12.999
Danny, or Sara. Okay?

1:11:13.032 --> 1:11:14.566
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:11:14.599 --> 1:11:16.168
Okay, wait.
What the fuck is going on?

1:11:16.202 --> 1:11:17.803
There's no time for that.

1:11:17.837 --> 1:11:19.972
- Gonna need a ride.
- Check.

1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:30.116
- You're a saint, man. Thank you.
- Need a ride?

1:12:05.583 --> 1:12:07.485
This is a really
creepy place.

1:12:08.553 --> 1:12:09.454
This way.

1:12:13.225 --> 1:12:15.628
Yeah, this guy
does look like a creep.

1:12:27.539 --> 1:12:28.674
Holy fuck.

1:12:35.982 --> 1:12:37.750
Yeah, wish I would've
stayed in the car.

1:12:39.251 --> 1:12:40.786
Are those tongues?

1:12:40.820 --> 1:12:43.055
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

1:12:43.089 --> 1:12:45.124
Yo.

1:12:45.157 --> 1:12:46.792
You guys wanna check this out?

1:12:55.134 --> 1:12:56.869
"In the event
of the natural death

1:12:56.902 --> 1:12:59.772
of Geraldine Gooch,
beneficiary Abraham Emil Gooch

1:12:59.805 --> 1:13:03.676
shall receive $2,500,000."

1:13:10.182 --> 1:13:12.284
I don't think
you should see this, man.

1:13:15.888 --> 1:13:16.822
I'm sorry, man.

1:13:22.594 --> 1:13:23.696
Yeah, we should go.

1:13:30.269 --> 1:13:31.303
Shit.

1:13:34.874 --> 1:13:35.775
That's his girl.

1:13:37.209 --> 1:13:38.177
Come on, man. You all right?

1:13:39.779 --> 1:13:40.713
Oh, shit.

1:13:41.914 --> 1:13:42.982
Cool, man.

1:13:44.717 --> 1:13:46.252
I know this is a lot
to be taking in...

1:13:46.285 --> 1:13:47.552
Shut the fuck up.

1:14:05.271 --> 1:14:06.739
Warm that up for you, sir?

1:14:09.108 --> 1:14:11.710
Warm, I'd like that.

1:14:11.744 --> 1:14:13.245
Thank you, darling.

1:14:13.279 --> 1:14:14.579
No problem.

1:14:24.023 --> 1:14:26.058
You might wanna, you know...

1:14:26.092 --> 1:14:27.927
Invest in some strong mouthwash?

1:14:32.364 --> 1:14:35.101
Oh, it's the Girl Scouts
of America.

1:14:35.134 --> 1:14:37.736
You guys selling cookies
in the neighborhood today?

1:14:37.770 --> 1:14:41.874
- Something off about him, huh?
- Definitely not honest.

1:14:41.907 --> 1:14:45.344
Come on, huh? I gotta work
in this neighborhood too.

1:14:45.377 --> 1:14:47.646
Honest Abe
is a scary fucking guy.

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.148
Scary? I'll tell you
what's scary.

1:14:49.181 --> 1:14:51.183
Some sick fuck eating lunch

1:14:51.217 --> 1:14:53.352
with your girl's tongue
in his fucking lap!

1:14:53.385 --> 1:14:56.021
Come on!
Man's still gotta eat, huh?

1:14:56.055 --> 1:14:58.190
What the fuck? Come on, man.

1:14:59.358 --> 1:15:01.127
Jesus Christ. Come on.

1:15:03.896 --> 1:15:06.365
Hey, come on. What the fuck?

1:15:06.398 --> 1:15:10.669
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:15:10.703 --> 1:15:12.204
- Come on. We can work this out.
- C'mon. Let's go. Move it.

1:15:12.238 --> 1:15:13.839
We can work this out. Come on.

1:15:13.873 --> 1:15:16.142
Can't you do something here?
Wanna jump in?

1:15:16.175 --> 1:15:18.177
- Just the driver, pal.
- Come on!

1:15:18.210 --> 1:15:20.446
- Look. Let's go back to the bar.
- Where the fuck is he?

1:15:20.479 --> 1:15:21.580
Look. I'll buy you guys
some drinks.

1:15:21.614 --> 1:15:23.816
Let's go back to the bar
and talk about it. Come on!

1:15:23.849 --> 1:15:25.351
This cowboy
don't know nothing, huh?

1:15:25.384 --> 1:15:28.287
Fucked if I know.
The guy's fucking crazy. Why?

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:30.055
Fucked if you don't know, Felix?

1:15:30.089 --> 1:15:32.458
- Come on.
- Fucked if you don't know?

1:15:32.491 --> 1:15:34.426
To be or not to be.

1:15:34.460 --> 1:15:37.463
Whether it is nobler
in the mind to suffer

1:15:37.496 --> 1:15:40.833
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

1:15:40.866 --> 1:15:43.736
What the fuck does it mean?
What does it mean? What?

1:15:43.769 --> 1:15:46.071
Translation: bad fucking luck.

1:15:46.105 --> 1:15:48.440
Otherwise known as life.
Right, Felix?

1:15:48.474 --> 1:15:51.443
Maybe I just put a bullet
in your fucking sick head.

1:15:51.477 --> 1:15:52.711
Come on. Come on.

1:15:55.147 --> 1:15:57.016
Come on, man. Look.
I can put together

1:15:57.049 --> 1:15:59.318
a fucking deal for you.
All right, man.

1:15:59.351 --> 1:16:00.886
I swear to God.
We've been friends

1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:02.788
for a long fucking time, man.
Come on.

1:16:02.821 --> 1:16:04.256
But give me a little time.

1:16:04.290 --> 1:16:06.258
I'll put together a deal
that's fucking awesome.

1:16:06.292 --> 1:16:08.260
No, no, no. It'll be beautiful.

1:16:08.294 --> 1:16:10.095
We could be friends again.
Come on.

1:16:10.129 --> 1:16:11.764
- Let's just talk this over.
- Get down. Get down.

1:16:11.797 --> 1:16:12.965
- Let's just talk this over.
- Get down.

1:16:12.998 --> 1:16:13.966
- Come on. Come on.
- Get down.

1:16:18.837 --> 1:16:21.941
- Fuck!
- That jog your memory any?

1:16:21.974 --> 1:16:23.275
Huh, Felix?

1:16:23.309 --> 1:16:25.211
- Huh?
- Fuck!

1:16:28.447 --> 1:16:30.916
Now you know where
the next one's going, Felix?

1:16:32.351 --> 1:16:34.486
To be or not to be.
Right, Felix, huh?

1:16:39.925 --> 1:16:42.328
- Oh, fuck.
- Answer it.

1:16:42.361 --> 1:16:43.329
Answer it!

1:16:43.362 --> 1:16:44.830
Hey, Abe.

1:16:45.331 --> 1:16:46.999
Hey.

1:16:47.032 --> 1:16:48.767
<i>Can you still get
to those punks</i>

1:16:48.801 --> 1:16:50.269
<i>who stole my cards?</i>

1:16:50.302 --> 1:16:51.937
Yeah.

1:16:51.971 --> 1:16:54.006
I can, yeah.

1:16:54.039 --> 1:16:56.308
<i>I've got something to trade.</i>

1:16:56.342 --> 1:16:59.245
Fucking tell 'em yourself.

1:16:59.278 --> 1:17:01.046
Talk to him. Talk to...

1:17:03.148 --> 1:17:05.818
<i>Do you have my daddy's cards?</i>

1:17:05.851 --> 1:17:07.319
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

1:17:07.353 --> 1:17:09.822
Fuck you
and your baseball cards.

1:17:09.855 --> 1:17:11.357
<i>Fuck your girl.</i>

1:17:11.390 --> 1:17:13.425
<i>If I don't get my cards back,</i>

1:17:13.459 --> 1:17:16.362
<i>another girl is gonna suffer
the same fate.</i>

1:17:20.299 --> 1:17:21.934
<i>Is your partner there?</i>

1:17:29.074 --> 1:17:30.476
Yeah, what do you want?

1:17:30.509 --> 1:17:33.045
Somebody help me!

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:37.216
<i>And she's gonna get
what the whore got</i>

1:17:37.249 --> 1:17:39.518
<i>if I don't get my cards back.</i>

1:17:39.551 --> 1:17:42.154
<i>Except she'll get it worse.</i>

1:17:42.187 --> 1:17:44.556
<i>'Cause I got a soft spot</i>

1:17:44.590 --> 1:17:45.958
<i>for whores.</i>

1:17:45.991 --> 1:17:47.226
It's Sara.

1:17:47.259 --> 1:17:48.327
He's got my Sara.

1:17:53.565 --> 1:17:55.601
Hey, Abe. How's it going, buddy?

1:17:55.635 --> 1:17:57.369
<i>Get the fuck outta here.</i>

1:17:57.836 --> 1:18:00.506
I want my baseball cards.

1:18:00.539 --> 1:18:03.575
Abe, come on. Come on.
We can, we can...

1:18:03.609 --> 1:18:06.945
We can resolve this, you know.
Plan. Make an exchange, okay?

1:18:06.979 --> 1:18:09.481
You just can't kill the girl,
Mr. Gooch.

1:18:11.417 --> 1:18:13.452
What did you just call me?

1:18:14.553 --> 1:18:16.455
<i>Mr. Abraham Emil Gooch.</i>

1:18:16.488 --> 1:18:18.991
<i>I've got a pretty good idea
of who I'm dealing with.</i>

1:18:19.024 --> 1:18:20.392
And I don't care, Abe.
I don't give a fuck

1:18:20.426 --> 1:18:22.594
provided you spare the girl.

1:18:23.896 --> 1:18:26.332
<i>The girl. The girl!</i>

1:18:27.333 --> 1:18:29.068
<i>Fuck the girl!</i>

1:18:29.101 --> 1:18:31.570
<i>I want my baseball cards!</i>

1:18:31.603 --> 1:18:33.005
Yeah, I'm getting there.

1:18:35.140 --> 1:18:36.875
Bring us the girl, alive,

1:18:36.909 --> 1:18:38.645
and Mr. Emil Gooch
can disappear, poof,

1:18:38.678 --> 1:18:40.612
into thin air.
Just go on his merry way.

1:18:40.647 --> 1:18:44.249
<i>But what about my daddy's cards?</i>

1:18:44.283 --> 1:18:47.219
And the same Mr. Gooch
can disappear

1:18:47.252 --> 1:18:49.488
with all of his daddy's
baseball cards.

1:18:51.390 --> 1:18:54.493
And all for the bargain price
of 150k.

1:18:54.526 --> 1:18:57.029
I did my research, Abe.

1:18:57.062 --> 1:18:58.530
I know it's fair, so.

1:18:59.431 --> 1:19:00.366
That's it.

1:19:02.669 --> 1:19:04.937
Dilemma resolved.

1:19:04.970 --> 1:19:07.473
And don't
fucking try and tell me

1:19:07.506 --> 1:19:09.575
that you don't got the money,
'cause I know you do.

1:19:12.111 --> 1:19:13.011
Abe?

1:19:15.114 --> 1:19:16.382
What would your father want?

1:19:17.717 --> 1:19:21.120
<i>Okay. Deal.</i>

1:19:22.121 --> 1:19:24.423
<i>Meet me at the junkyard</i>

1:19:24.456 --> 1:19:26.925
<i>where 7th
meets the Detroit river.</i>

1:19:28.193 --> 1:19:29.629
<i>In... In one hour.</i>

1:19:29.662 --> 1:19:31.631
How did he find Sara?

1:19:31.664 --> 1:19:33.666
I don't know, man. Look.

1:19:33.700 --> 1:19:36.034
I didn't know
what was happening, all right?

1:19:38.070 --> 1:19:39.938
I had no idea, no choice.

1:19:59.659 --> 1:20:01.160
All right, keep it running.

1:20:16.074 --> 1:20:19.144
We've got a problem.
We're gonna fix it.

1:20:19.178 --> 1:20:21.648
Head to Comic World.
We'll explain on the way.

1:20:31.290 --> 1:20:32.624
Hey.

1:20:32.659 --> 1:20:35.093
- Have you seen a kid?
- Every day, pal.

1:20:35.127 --> 1:20:38.197
Girl, okay, with a duffel bag
full of very old baseball cards.

1:20:38.230 --> 1:20:40.098
- Oh, the potty mouth?
- Yeah, that's the one.

1:20:40.132 --> 1:20:41.233
She just left with the cards.

1:20:45.537 --> 1:20:46.472
Taylor!

1:20:55.113 --> 1:20:56.081
Taylor!

1:21:00.552 --> 1:21:01.688
Taylor's disappeared.

1:21:03.823 --> 1:21:05.157
Sara's dead.

1:21:06.191 --> 1:21:07.259
Sara's dead.

1:21:09.127 --> 1:21:11.764
- How much for the whole box?
- Twenty bucks.

1:21:11.798 --> 1:21:13.031
I'll take it.

1:21:13.065 --> 1:21:14.667
Give me the blue duffel bag.

1:21:19.404 --> 1:21:21.306
- No. No...
- What? You got a better idea?

1:22:03.448 --> 1:22:06.618
You guys shouldn't have
fucked with my collection.

1:22:06.653 --> 1:22:08.153
You sick fuck.

1:22:08.186 --> 1:22:10.322
Sending me
my girl's tongue in a jar.

1:22:10.355 --> 1:22:12.324
Special delivery.

1:22:12.357 --> 1:22:14.593
She was a tough bitch though.

1:22:14.627 --> 1:22:15.728
I'll give her that.

1:22:17.296 --> 1:22:18.731
Her head...

1:22:18.765 --> 1:22:21.701
it still popped
like a watermelon.

1:22:21.734 --> 1:22:23.268
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:22:23.302 --> 1:22:24.671
He still has Sara. Wait.

1:22:30.576 --> 1:22:31.510
Where is she?

1:22:32.544 --> 1:22:33.713
She's safe.

1:22:34.613 --> 1:22:36.481
And mostly intact.

1:22:37.349 --> 1:22:38.651
Cards first.

1:22:40.285 --> 1:22:42.487
Then I'll let you know
where you can find

1:22:42.521 --> 1:22:44.891
what's left of the dumb bitch.

1:22:44.924 --> 1:22:47.092
You motherfucker,
where is my girl?

1:22:51.363 --> 1:22:53.532
Listen up, cry baby.

1:22:53.565 --> 1:22:56.903
Your girl's my new
life insurance policy.

1:22:56.936 --> 1:22:59.304
When I get my cards back

1:22:59.338 --> 1:23:03.408
and I drive
out of this junkyard alive,

1:23:03.442 --> 1:23:06.846
then I'll make sure
you get your bitch back.

1:23:09.281 --> 1:23:10.215
I mean...

1:23:11.784 --> 1:23:12.752
girl.

1:23:14.286 --> 1:23:16.388
You don't know
how sick you are, do you?

1:23:20.525 --> 1:23:21.628
Where's the money?

1:23:24.529 --> 1:23:26.164
Open it, you sick fuck!

1:23:38.276 --> 1:23:39.511
And my cards?

1:23:50.923 --> 1:23:52.759
Trying to land me a good...

1:23:59.297 --> 1:24:01.500
Hey, this wasn't part
of the plan, I'm sorry,

1:24:01.533 --> 1:24:03.836
but your cards
have been misplaced.

1:24:03.870 --> 1:24:05.938
They're temporarily misplaced,

1:24:05.972 --> 1:24:07.874
but when they turn up,
we'll really,

1:24:07.907 --> 1:24:09.909
we'll make sure
to get 'em to you.

1:24:09.942 --> 1:24:10.843
Back it up.

1:24:12.411 --> 1:24:13.311
Back up.

1:24:14.246 --> 1:24:15.347
Yep.

1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:17.650
You too. Now, drop it.

1:24:17.684 --> 1:24:19.451
You out of your
fucking mind too?

1:24:19.484 --> 1:24:20.619
Now.

1:24:20.653 --> 1:24:22.354
Toss your guns over there.

1:24:23.756 --> 1:24:25.190
Fucking do it.

1:24:28.828 --> 1:24:30.395
Get the old fuck's gun too.

1:24:37.970 --> 1:24:39.538
I own your ass.

1:24:40.106 --> 1:24:41.573
You can keep
the flashlight though.

1:24:42.541 --> 1:24:43.743
Stupid fucking thing.

1:24:44.609 --> 1:24:45.712
Et tu, Brute?

1:24:47.345 --> 1:24:48.513
We were partners.

1:24:50.983 --> 1:24:53.986
A plague upon it when thieves
cannot be true to one another.

1:24:55.420 --> 1:24:57.355
Travel light.

1:24:57.389 --> 1:24:59.759
It's a nice sentiment though.
More Shakespeare.

1:25:02.294 --> 1:25:04.864
I told you he had
a totally fucked up aura.

1:25:05.865 --> 1:25:07.633
Jesus Christ.

1:25:07.667 --> 1:25:10.368
Don't look so shocked.
You got conned.

1:25:10.402 --> 1:25:12.004
All right. Big fucking deal.
Shit happens.

1:25:12.038 --> 1:25:13.840
Put it in your fucking memoirs.

1:25:13.873 --> 1:25:14.974
Pawn broker.

1:25:16.308 --> 1:25:17.877
Pass me the case. Nice and easy.

1:25:22.682 --> 1:25:26.018
Wait. You and me
need to have a talk.

1:25:26.052 --> 1:25:28.520
What do you say
we get some dinner?

1:25:31.924 --> 1:25:34.660
Can you believe this fucking
idiot actually got the money?

1:25:37.930 --> 1:25:39.799
You two.
Over with your new friend.

1:25:41.634 --> 1:25:42.735
Fucking move.

1:25:44.804 --> 1:25:46.304
Don't fucking play with me.

1:25:47.774 --> 1:25:48.674
Danny.

1:25:50.843 --> 1:25:52.044
Your plan almost worked.

1:25:53.646 --> 1:25:55.915
Almost. You should be proud.

1:25:57.750 --> 1:25:58.718
I am.

1:25:59.886 --> 1:26:01.921
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1:26:01.954 --> 1:26:03.990
I have shit to do.

1:26:25.912 --> 1:26:29.048
He shouldn't have
stood me up for dinner.

1:26:37.957 --> 1:26:39.926
You gotta be kidding me.

1:26:39.959 --> 1:26:41.093
Slimy bastard.

1:26:53.906 --> 1:26:55.808
Son of a...

1:26:58.110 --> 1:26:59.779
Badass, Abe.

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:09.956
I can't believe
I fucking missed it.

1:27:12.457 --> 1:27:13.860
You are one sick bastard.

1:27:16.128 --> 1:27:17.730
No.

1:27:17.763 --> 1:27:19.999
- I've got a hobby.
- A hobby?

1:27:24.704 --> 1:27:25.905
My truth-telling,

1:27:27.572 --> 1:27:31.476
honesty-locating flashlight
compass magnet plus

1:27:31.509 --> 1:27:33.646
is telling me I've got
a piece of shit pawn broker

1:27:33.679 --> 1:27:36.414
with a fucked up comb-over
temporarily stuck

1:27:36.448 --> 1:27:37.817
to the bottom of my shoe.

1:27:39.919 --> 1:27:41.419
How the fuck did we get here?

1:27:41.453 --> 1:27:43.089
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

1:27:43.122 --> 1:27:44.924
He's still got Sara.
Where is she?

1:27:46.192 --> 1:27:48.127
If you kill me,

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:50.562
he'll never find his girl.

1:27:51.496 --> 1:27:52.832
She'll die.

1:27:52.865 --> 1:27:55.433
So help me up,
you miserable punk.

1:28:01.841 --> 1:28:02.742
Sara?

1:28:04.509 --> 1:28:05.477
I need the keys.

1:28:09.614 --> 1:28:13.618
Looks like you're finally
out of cards, Abe.

1:28:15.888 --> 1:28:16.789
Wait.

1:28:17.723 --> 1:28:19.457
W-w-wait.

1:28:19.491 --> 1:28:20.192
I know you.

1:28:23.029 --> 1:28:23.930
Baby?

1:28:27.599 --> 1:28:29.601
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

1:28:29.635 --> 1:28:30.535
I'll get you out.

1:28:34.572 --> 1:28:37.009
Hold on, baby. I'll get you out.
Okay.

1:28:37.043 --> 1:28:38.644
All right. Okay. Calm down.

1:28:38.678 --> 1:28:40.046
- We got you, we got you.
- Johnny.

1:28:40.079 --> 1:28:41.513
Hold on. Hold on.

1:28:41.546 --> 1:28:42.982
- Danny.
- Hold on. Grab my hand.

1:28:43.015 --> 1:28:44.984
Come on. We got you.

1:28:46.152 --> 1:28:48.486
Okay. I got you. Okay.

1:28:49.956 --> 1:28:51.991
Okay. Shh. Shh. Okay.

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:55.861
It's okay. It's over.

1:28:57.029 --> 1:28:58.664
Hey, it's okay. I've got you.

1:29:01.667 --> 1:29:03.568
What the fuck
is going on out here?

1:29:06.739 --> 1:29:08.240
Well, I'll be jitterbugged.

1:29:08.274 --> 1:29:09.842
What happened to him?

1:29:09.875 --> 1:29:11.609
Come on, baby.

1:29:11.644 --> 1:29:12.610
That's it.

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:15.613
He...

1:29:17.049 --> 1:29:18.250
He ran into this.

1:29:33.232 --> 1:29:34.800
Makes perfect sense.

1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:36.534
Yes, sir.

1:29:37.569 --> 1:29:38.904
Perfect sense.

1:29:38.938 --> 1:29:41.007
Next question.

1:29:42.607 --> 1:29:43.642
Who the hell is he?

1:29:45.344 --> 1:29:47.079
Heard about
all the missing girls?

1:29:58.691 --> 1:29:59.792
Bingo!

1:30:02.594 --> 1:30:06.198
You know, except for the,
the fucked up comb-over,

1:30:06.232 --> 1:30:08.801
he doesn't look nothing
like the police sketch.

1:30:08.834 --> 1:30:11.804
No, but I recognize
the girls though.

1:30:11.837 --> 1:30:14.572
Yes, sir. And right here
in my junkyard.

1:30:14.606 --> 1:30:15.741
Right here in my junkyard.

1:30:15.775 --> 1:30:17.943
- You know...
- Okay, Edgar.

1:30:17.977 --> 1:30:21.747
You got a car compactor
around here, or...

1:30:21.781 --> 1:30:24.950
- an incinerator?
- Yeah, sure do. Got both.

1:30:24.984 --> 1:30:25.885
Why?

1:30:27.286 --> 1:30:29.789
Toss the sick bastard
into the trunk.

1:30:29.822 --> 1:30:31.023
Crush it.

1:30:31.057 --> 1:30:32.958
And then burn it. Melt it down.

1:30:32.992 --> 1:30:34.226
Just put him in the trunk.

1:30:43.335 --> 1:30:44.670
He got off easy.

1:30:48.974 --> 1:30:50.242
To do a great right,

1:30:51.777 --> 1:30:52.845
do a little wrong.

1:30:57.716 --> 1:30:59.852
- I'll be damned.
- Hey, guys.

1:31:00.953 --> 1:31:01.921
Fuck off.

1:31:07.726 --> 1:31:09.628
It's all there.

1:31:09.662 --> 1:31:13.065
All right. Every goddamn one.

1:31:13.099 --> 1:31:15.935
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

1:31:15.968 --> 1:31:18.037
I never saw nothing
like this before.

1:31:19.805 --> 1:31:21.040
Guess they made me crazy.

1:31:26.912 --> 1:31:27.947
It takes two.

1:31:31.016 --> 1:31:33.853
I'm sorry that I didn't...

1:31:33.886 --> 1:31:37.022
stay put like you told me to.

1:31:37.056 --> 1:31:42.394
I didn't cause any real
major fucking trouble, did I?

1:31:42.428 --> 1:31:44.964
Never thought I'd enjoy
hearing you cuss so much.

1:31:51.804 --> 1:31:53.772
Yeah, those are yours. Um.

1:31:53.806 --> 1:31:55.741
Just one string attached to it.

1:31:57.109 --> 1:31:58.410
Two strings attached.

1:32:04.483 --> 1:32:06.185
You gotta turn them into cash.

1:32:09.321 --> 1:32:13.125
You gotta go
and you gotta cut Sara in.

1:32:13.159 --> 1:32:17.129
Just so she finishes
nursing school. And then

1:32:17.163 --> 1:32:18.797
you'll get it all
when you're 18,

1:32:18.831 --> 1:32:21.066
just with varied advancements,
you know.

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:24.703
Sweet 16, make up, dress better.

1:32:27.473 --> 1:32:29.975
You can go
fuck yourself with that

1:32:30.009 --> 1:32:32.411
hair, make up, dress bullshit.

1:32:34.113 --> 1:32:36.215
But the rest of the deal
sounds mad dope.

1:32:36.248 --> 1:32:37.983
Mm-hmm.

1:32:38.017 --> 1:32:39.251
I'm gonna call Sara now.

1:32:42.755 --> 1:32:45.124
Got to hit the head.

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:57.203
<i>'Cause I'm
your main girl now, right?</i>

1:32:58.170 --> 1:32:59.138
<i>Your lucky Penny?</i>

1:33:08.347 --> 1:33:10.716
<i>I'm just messing with you.
I like it.</i>

1:33:12.084 --> 1:33:13.085
<i>It's nice.</i>
