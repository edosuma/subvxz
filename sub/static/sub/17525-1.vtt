<i>This is the salton sea</i>

01:38.574 --> 01:40.275
<i>in Southern California.</i>

01:40.342 --> 01:42.944
<i>A strange phenomenon,
in which nature</i>

01:43.012 --> 01:44.396
<i>has placed 400 square miles</i>

01:44.463 --> 01:47.732
<i>of salt water in the
middle of an arid desert.</i>

01:47.800 --> 01:50.235
<i>In the desert,
near the shore of the sea,</i>

01:50.303 --> 01:52.070
<i>the government has established</i>

01:52.138 --> 01:55.540
<i>one of its most important
naval research bases.</i>

01:55.607 --> 01:57.375
<i>At the laboratory
on the secluded</i>

01:57.443 --> 01:58.810
<i>south tip of the base,</i>

01:58.877 --> 02:00.711
<i>top-secret atomic experiments</i>

02:00.779 --> 02:04.715
<i>are carried out under
rigid security control.</i>

02:04.783 --> 02:07.018
<i>At the airfield,
under the direction</i>

02:07.086 --> 02:08.586
<i>of the parachute test unit,</i>

02:08.654 --> 02:10.255
<i>planes leave on daily missions</i>

02:10.323 --> 02:12.623
<i>for the jump area
over the salton sea,</i>

02:12.691 --> 02:15.126
<i>where Navy men
dive in the government's</i>

02:15.194 --> 02:17.628
<i>continuous researching
of parachutes,</i>

02:17.696 --> 02:19.297
<i>to meet the
ever-increasing demands</i>

02:19.365 --> 02:23.134
<i>of modern flight.</i>

02:23.202 --> 02:25.603
<i>On may 17,
in the early afternoon,</i>

02:25.671 --> 02:28.573
<i>an earthquake occurred
in the desert area.</i>

02:28.640 --> 02:29.824
<i>Its force was
strong enough to be felt</i>

02:29.892 --> 02:31.460
<i>at the research base,</i>

02:31.527 --> 02:33.728
<i>even though its epicenter
was 10 miles away</i>

02:33.796 --> 02:36.531
<i>in the wild rock
formations 350 feet</i>

02:36.599 --> 02:40.668
<i>below the surface
of the salton sea.</i>

02:40.736 --> 02:42.304
<i>However, less than 2 hours</i>

02:42.371 --> 02:43.705
<i>after the earthquake,</i>

02:43.772 --> 02:46.641
<i>the base was back to
normal operating procedure.</i>

02:46.709 --> 02:49.077
<i>Lt. Hollister,
of the parachute test unit,</i>

02:49.145 --> 02:50.345
<i>was preparing to make</i>

02:50.413 --> 02:52.380
<i>the last-scheduled
jump of the day.</i>

02:52.448 --> 02:55.683
<i>Hollister was a veteran
of over 300 test flights.</i>

02:55.751 --> 03:02.357
<i>For him, this was to be
one more routine jump.</i>

03:02.425 --> 03:04.292
<i>Meanwhile, on the salton sea,</i>

03:04.360 --> 03:06.161
<i>crewmen Johnson and Sanders</i>

03:06.229 --> 03:08.480
<i>were headed out
to meet lt. Hollister.</i>

03:08.547 --> 03:09.647
<i>And for them,</i>

03:09.715 --> 03:14.770
<i>this was to be
one more routine pickup.</i>

03:14.837 --> 03:17.439
This is flutterboy 2-4-2
calling Navy 8-7.

03:17.507 --> 03:19.541
You are now in sight. Over.

03:19.609 --> 03:20.709
<i>Hollister now</i>

03:20.777 --> 03:22.877
<i>preparing to jump. Over and out.</i>

03:53.476 --> 03:54.676
He's down.

04:00.733 --> 04:04.569
Navy 8-7, this is flutterboy 2-4-2.
Over.

04:04.637 --> 04:06.337
<i>This is Navy 8-7. Over.</i>

04:06.405 --> 04:07.438
He's in sight.

04:07.506 --> 04:09.608
You're clear to return
to the base. Over.

04:09.675 --> 04:11.710
Roger. Leaving for home.
Over and out.

04:17.333 --> 04:21.135
Flutterboy 2-4-2 calling
land radio 4. Over.

04:21.202 --> 04:22.604
Land radio 4. Come in.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.071
<i>Jumper landed safely.</i>

04:24.139 --> 04:25.406
<i>He's down about 2-miles in,</i>

04:25.474 --> 04:27.609
<i>off the southeast tip.</i>

04:27.676 --> 04:31.379
That's pretty far out. Hope
this doesn't take all night.

04:31.446 --> 04:33.097
Yeah, I'll call you back.

05:09.568 --> 05:10.835
Where is he?

05:10.903 --> 05:12.170
I don't know.

05:12.237 --> 05:14.205
He's gotta be here.
I saw him hit.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.409
Hey, lieutenant!

05:17.476 --> 05:18.777
I'm going down for him.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.390
You see him?

05:32.424 --> 05:34.576
No. I'll try the other side.

05:52.194 --> 05:56.731
Johnson?

05:56.799 --> 06:00.702
Johnson!

06:00.770 --> 06:04.155
Johnson!

06:04.223 --> 06:08.560
Johnson!

06:08.627 --> 06:10.562
Uh.

06:10.629 --> 06:12.263
Ah!

06:12.331 --> 06:14.031
Ah!

06:19.721 --> 06:22.190
This is land radio 4 calling

06:22.258 --> 06:24.725
flutterboy 2-4-2.
Come in, please.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.136
Land radio 4
calling flutterboy 2-4-2.

06:35.204 --> 06:37.889
Come in.

06:37.957 --> 06:40.491
Come in, flutterboy 2-4-2.

06:48.301 --> 06:50.368
El centro base.

06:50.436 --> 06:52.804
Naval intelligence, please.

06:55.107 --> 06:57.275
Cmdr. Twillinger's office.

06:57.343 --> 07:02.347
He's on the other line.
Okay, I'll put you on hold.

07:02.415 --> 07:03.982
Lieutenant, I appreciate
your calling,

07:04.050 --> 07:05.616
but there's nothing I can do.

07:05.684 --> 07:07.118
He went awol, it doesn't matter

07:07.186 --> 07:08.586
what the circumstances were.

07:08.654 --> 07:10.388
I'll have to refer the case.

07:10.456 --> 07:11.789
Wait a minute!

07:11.857 --> 07:13.825
In the 1 week
that I've been here,

07:13.892 --> 07:15.893
I've had a dozen
different cases come up.

07:15.962 --> 07:17.095
I don't decide these things.

07:17.163 --> 07:19.897
I'm an investigating officer,
not a judge.

07:19.966 --> 07:22.033
All right,
I'll send you notification.

07:22.101 --> 07:23.901
I know this guy. He's all right.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.803
He made a mistake, but...

07:25.871 --> 07:26.871
He sure did!

07:26.905 --> 07:29.390
Commander, Wyatt on 3.

07:29.458 --> 07:30.624
Wyatt?

07:30.692 --> 07:33.928
He's our radioman
at the salton sea pier.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.631
Twillinger. Yes, Wyatt.

07:37.699 --> 07:39.200
How long ago?

07:39.268 --> 07:40.868
45 minutes.

07:40.936 --> 07:42.704
No, I've lost radio contact.

07:42.771 --> 07:45.240
It's not a mechanical failure
at this end.

07:45.307 --> 07:48.026
Have a boat standing by.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.094
Trouble?

07:49.161 --> 07:50.462
The last pickup crew
hasn't reported in.

07:50.529 --> 07:53.264
We'll have to go out.
Sally, wait until I call you.

07:53.332 --> 07:57.202
Yes, sir.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.104
Still there, mom?

07:59.171 --> 08:00.638
Looks like ironheart's

08:00.706 --> 08:02.207
gonna work late again tonight.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.475
That's right.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.217
Shove off.

08:26.165 --> 08:27.332
I don't see why
they weren't covered

08:27.400 --> 08:29.000
for something like this.

08:29.068 --> 08:31.302
They jump close
to 20 men every day.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.905
It's a good system,
nothing goes wrong.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.806
Something went wrong this time.

08:35.874 --> 08:38.354
A boat off the port bow, sir.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.768
She looks deserted.
Head up alongside.

08:47.836 --> 08:49.116
Aye.

09:10.859 --> 09:13.161
It's Sanders.

09:13.228 --> 09:14.548
Check the water
for the other men.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.030
Yes, sir.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.781
Sam.

09:33.849 --> 09:36.650
Look at this.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.052
What is it?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.854
I don't know.
You better take a sample.

09:39.921 --> 09:44.758
Have the lab run a test.

09:44.826 --> 09:46.160
Commander, there's something

09:46.228 --> 09:47.928
surfacing on the portside.

10:00.158 --> 10:01.626
It's Hollister.

10:15.273 --> 10:17.113
Like I told you, he said he'd

10:17.142 --> 10:18.743
call me back later
and that was all.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.177
That's when you lost contact?

10:20.245 --> 10:21.612
Yes, and I called the base.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.480
When you talked last,
was everything normal?

10:23.549 --> 10:25.115
Yes. We was just kiddin',

10:25.183 --> 10:26.617
you know how you get
on the phone.

10:26.685 --> 10:27.885
That's against regulations.

10:27.953 --> 10:28.986
Yes, sir.

10:29.054 --> 10:30.454
Have a report in my
office in the morning.

10:30.522 --> 10:31.689
Yes, sir.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.224
May I have that sample
we took off the boat?

10:34.292 --> 10:35.426
Right here.

10:35.493 --> 10:36.627
How long's
that autopsy on Hollister

10:36.695 --> 10:37.828
gonna take?

10:37.896 --> 10:39.129
We'll have it early tomorrow.

10:39.197 --> 10:40.431
I'll cover it for you.

10:40.498 --> 10:41.432
Take some divers

10:41.499 --> 10:42.967
and go after Johnson
in the morning.

10:43.035 --> 10:44.075
It's too late to dive now.

10:44.102 --> 10:44.969
Okay.

10:45.037 --> 10:46.336
I want to take this to the lab.

10:46.404 --> 10:47.638
It's right there.

10:47.706 --> 10:50.007
Go through the main door
and turn to your right.

10:50.075 --> 10:51.542
I've already spoken
to Dr. Rogers.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.477
Good.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.112
We won't need you
anymore, Wyatt.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.881
Thank you, sir.

10:56.949 --> 10:57.949
That your new boss?

10:57.983 --> 10:59.450
Yeah.

10:59.517 --> 11:03.420
Sure is an eager beaver, sir.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.648
Yeah, that he is.

11:12.765 --> 11:16.300
You might know I'd be
making eight carbons.

11:16.368 --> 11:17.735
I said I'm always
making eight carbons

11:17.803 --> 11:19.403
when my fingers go to...

11:19.471 --> 11:20.404
Hello.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.705
Is this Dr. Rogers' office?

11:21.774 --> 11:22.640
Yes.

11:22.707 --> 11:23.875
I'm cmdr. Twillinger.

11:23.942 --> 11:25.143
I'll tell him.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.912
I think you were notified
that I was coming.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.782
I was sorry to hear
about the accident.

11:30.849 --> 11:32.289
Young lady, you're
not to discuss that

11:32.317 --> 11:34.451
with anyone. Do you understand?

11:34.519 --> 11:39.390
No, of course not.

11:39.457 --> 11:40.724
I'm Dr. Rogers, commander.

11:40.793 --> 11:42.126
Twillinger.

11:42.194 --> 11:43.360
Lt. Clemens said you have

11:43.428 --> 11:44.628
a substance to be analyzed.

11:44.696 --> 11:48.266
I do. It's in here.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.535
Come on,
let's take a look at it.

11:51.603 --> 11:52.870
Where did you find this?

11:52.938 --> 11:54.839
On the boat, near the body.

11:54.907 --> 11:57.141
Lt. Clemens told me
what happened.

11:57.209 --> 11:58.509
I'm terribly sorry.

11:58.576 --> 12:00.444
We lost 3 men, so far.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.779
At least, we think it's 3.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.881
We've only recovered 2 bodies.

12:03.949 --> 12:05.850
He said there was
something unnatural

12:05.918 --> 12:08.419
about the condition
of one of the bodies.

12:08.486 --> 12:11.088
There was. It was shriveled.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.090
Shriveled?

12:13.158 --> 12:14.325
Sometimes seawater

12:14.392 --> 12:16.694
does strange things
to human flesh.

12:16.762 --> 12:19.029
In this case, I don't think so.

12:19.097 --> 12:20.297
Would you say that the water

12:20.365 --> 12:24.668
in the sea could be radioactive?

12:24.736 --> 12:27.271
Commander, let me answer
you in this way.

12:27.339 --> 12:28.639
My 2 assistants do a lot

12:28.707 --> 12:30.040
of diving related to our work.

12:30.109 --> 12:31.409
I know that.

12:31.477 --> 12:35.012
We don't take any chances
with radioactivity.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.081
Our sea experiments
had nothing to do with

12:37.149 --> 12:38.282
what happened to your men

12:38.350 --> 12:39.901
or the condition of that body.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.971
You might be wrong.

12:43.038 --> 12:44.878
I've found
that people are always

12:44.940 --> 12:46.340
jumping to wild conclusions

12:46.408 --> 12:48.375
concerning atomic reaction.

12:48.443 --> 12:52.279
Science fact and science
fiction are not the same.

12:52.347 --> 12:54.827
Not in the least.
Just take a few minutes.

12:54.883 --> 12:56.784
Can you make it
as fast as possible?

12:56.852 --> 12:58.092
It'll only take a little while,

12:58.120 --> 13:00.355
as long as I'm not interrupted.

13:00.422 --> 13:02.673
I'll be outside.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.909
Gail, I'm returning
your child in the same

13:04.977 --> 13:07.144
condition as
when I got her. I think.

13:07.212 --> 13:08.513
Hi, sweetie.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.814
Hi, mommy.

13:09.882 --> 13:10.748
Excuse me.

13:10.816 --> 13:11.816
It's all right.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.417
May I go look at the rabbits?

13:13.485 --> 13:15.119
Not today, sweetie.

13:15.186 --> 13:17.354
Please. Hm-mmm.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.191
Mommy, of all those rabbits,
i like grace the best.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.376
You can't see her today.

13:22.444 --> 13:23.444
That's okay,

13:23.512 --> 13:24.545
I've got a ladybug

13:24.613 --> 13:25.713
to keep me company.

13:25.781 --> 13:27.815
Gail, when will the
boys be finished?

13:27.883 --> 13:29.523
They got tied up
because of the earthquake

13:29.551 --> 13:29.951
and had to reset all the tests.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.754
Oh.

13:32.821 --> 13:34.689
Hey. 2 minutes.

13:34.757 --> 13:36.057
Your wife and unborn child

13:36.125 --> 13:36.924
are starving.

13:36.992 --> 13:40.061
A minute and a half.

13:40.129 --> 13:42.463
What a life!

13:42.531 --> 13:45.366
Did I ever tell you
that I detest this lab?

13:45.433 --> 13:46.868
That husband of mine

13:46.935 --> 13:48.869
even has "top secret" stamped

13:48.937 --> 13:51.306
in red ink in the middle
of his chest.

13:51.373 --> 13:56.193
He does. "Secret,
secret, secret."

13:56.261 --> 13:59.196
You can't speed up science.

13:59.264 --> 14:01.332
I guess not.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.401
Would you like
to hold my ladybug?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.668
Hmm?

14:04.736 --> 14:06.938
I said, "would you like
to hold my ladybug?"

14:07.005 --> 14:09.506
Certainly. It's a privilege.

14:09.574 --> 14:11.926
Honey, don't bother him.

14:11.993 --> 14:14.362
That's all right.

14:14.430 --> 14:15.430
Doesn't she have

14:15.497 --> 14:16.664
pretty spots on her back?

14:16.732 --> 14:18.499
Yes, she has.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.501
Commander?

14:20.569 --> 14:22.970
It's just a
simple marine secretion,

14:23.038 --> 14:25.206
although there is
something that puzzles me.

14:25.273 --> 14:26.474
I'd like to run another series

14:26.542 --> 14:28.576
of tests on it tomorrow.
I'll call you.

14:28.644 --> 14:30.978
I'll wait for your call.

14:31.046 --> 14:32.580
You can get me on 254.

14:32.648 --> 14:33.414
254?

14:33.482 --> 14:35.450
That's right.

14:35.517 --> 14:40.955
My ladybug.
You forgot my ladybug!

14:41.022 --> 14:43.858
Maybe it's
on the floor somewhere.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.093
Don't worry about it.

14:46.161 --> 14:47.945
Sandy, you can find
another ladybug.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.380
But I don't want
another one, mommy.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.516
I tell you what,
when I get home,

14:52.584 --> 14:54.051
I'll see if I can find her.

14:54.119 --> 14:56.253
If I do, I'll bring
her back, okay?

14:56.321 --> 15:02.493
Okay.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.827
He's cute.

15:03.895 --> 15:06.097
I guess so.

15:06.164 --> 15:08.265
Did you mention that
you were available?

15:08.333 --> 15:10.468
Somehow it didn't come up.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.069
If I were you, it would have.

15:12.137 --> 15:13.670
You're a character.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.172
Ready to go home now?

15:15.240 --> 15:17.825
I guess so.

15:17.893 --> 15:21.562
I'm leaving now, doctor.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.465
'Night.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.399
Excuse me.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.500
That's okay.

15:26.568 --> 15:29.170
Just consider me
a piece of furniture.

15:35.377 --> 15:37.678
Sandy, come here.

15:37.746 --> 15:40.614
Look. I've got
a surprise for you.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.516
I found her for you.

15:42.584 --> 15:43.584
Thank you.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.653
I'll give her a good talking to.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.223
I wouldn't be too severe on her.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.291
Thank you very much.

15:50.358 --> 15:55.696
You're welcome.

15:55.764 --> 15:56.864
Goodbye.

15:56.932 --> 15:58.065
Goodbye.

16:26.895 --> 16:27.695
Cmdr. Twillinger?

16:27.762 --> 16:28.463
That's right.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.097
Nate brown.

16:29.164 --> 16:30.164
How do you do?

16:30.232 --> 16:31.752
You know Josh Peters,
sheriff's office.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
We've met.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.602
I've been with this
office for 15 years,

16:34.669 --> 16:36.870
but I've never seen
anything like this.

16:36.938 --> 16:37.838
Have you, Josh?

16:37.906 --> 16:39.107
Afraid not.

16:39.174 --> 16:41.209
I've seen a lot of people die
in different ways.

16:41.276 --> 16:42.210
What caused it?

16:42.277 --> 16:43.311
It's hard to tell.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.113
A puncture wound, I think.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.814
Both bodies taken from the sea

16:46.881 --> 16:49.083
were totally drained
of blood and water.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.451
What would make that happen?

16:50.519 --> 16:51.819
I have no idea.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.088
The wound could've been made
by any sharp object

16:54.156 --> 16:55.923
and naturally
the body would bleed.

16:55.991 --> 16:58.959
But simple bleeding
wouldn't cause this.

16:59.027 --> 17:00.861
It happened near
the research lab?

17:00.929 --> 17:02.763
Yes. But they say
there's no connection.

17:02.831 --> 17:04.198
Maybe.

17:04.266 --> 17:09.803
Take a look at the microscope.

17:09.871 --> 17:12.039
You're looking
at a piece of skin.

17:12.107 --> 17:14.258
Usually when
a body is left in water,

17:14.326 --> 17:16.493
the epidermal tissues
become swollen.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.496
But this is like leather.

17:18.563 --> 17:20.897
It doesn't even resemble
human skin anymore.

17:20.964 --> 17:22.665
Skin on a man
over 100 would have

17:22.733 --> 17:24.468
3 times the amount of moisture.

17:24.536 --> 17:27.037
What about the other man
we found on the boat?

17:27.105 --> 17:28.271
A stroke.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.507
A stroke?

17:29.574 --> 17:31.108
There's a technical name for it,

17:31.175 --> 17:32.710
but that's what it amounts to.

17:32.778 --> 17:34.144
I don't understand you.

17:34.212 --> 17:35.613
What could cause a stroke

17:35.680 --> 17:37.314
in a man that young?

17:37.382 --> 17:39.850
In that age group, only 2 things

17:39.918 --> 17:43.220
could cause a stroke:
Violent anger or fear.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.655
You can rule out anger.

17:44.723 --> 17:45.790
Hm-mmm.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.591
In my opinion, the man you found

17:47.659 --> 17:49.126
on the boat was literally

17:49.193 --> 17:51.361
scared to death.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.230
Do you have enough deputies

17:53.298 --> 17:55.132
to post a quarantine
on all the beaches

17:55.199 --> 17:57.134
until we find out
what happened out there?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.335
Yeah. I'll get right on it.

17:58.403 --> 18:00.137
Good.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.071
Thanks again for your help.

18:01.139 --> 18:03.824
Not at all.

18:03.892 --> 18:06.093
You boys care for a sandwich?

18:11.900 --> 18:14.285
Got tuna fish
and minced ham on rye.

18:14.352 --> 18:17.955
No, thanks.

18:18.023 --> 18:19.756
It's nice and cold.

18:30.969 --> 18:33.871
Close the beach? I got
22 people staying here.

18:33.939 --> 18:36.039
Sorry, we've got orders.
Nothing we can do.

18:36.107 --> 18:38.309
That's swell. So everybody

18:38.376 --> 18:39.743
should go home, is that it?

18:39.811 --> 18:41.378
Did you look
at the temperature today?

18:41.446 --> 18:43.046
Yes, we know it's hot.

18:43.114 --> 18:45.115
120 at 3:00. So nobody swims.

18:45.183 --> 18:47.251
What's wrong with the water?

18:47.319 --> 18:49.820
We got a bulletin, Mr. Davis.
That's all we know!

18:49.887 --> 18:51.255
Okay.

18:59.564 --> 19:01.465
Dr. Rogers' office.

19:01.533 --> 19:06.887
Yes, commander. Just a moment.

19:06.955 --> 19:08.155
<i>Dr. Rogers,</i>

19:08.223 --> 19:13.127
<i>cmdr. Twillinger on line 1.</i>

19:13.194 --> 19:15.929
Yes, commander.

19:15.997 --> 19:17.798
Yes, we're working on it.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.133
We hope to have something,

19:19.200 --> 19:21.001
late today or tomorrow.

19:21.069 --> 19:22.603
Tomorrow! Look, doctor,

19:22.671 --> 19:24.037
that's the only clue we've got.

19:24.105 --> 19:26.374
I could have sent it
to San Diego by now.

19:26.441 --> 19:27.958
Hold on, commander,
don't pressure us.

19:28.026 --> 19:29.226
We don't need it.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.194
I'll call you
as soon as I finish.

19:31.262 --> 19:36.233
I'll be in my office.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.002
I've just been read the riot act

19:38.069 --> 19:40.303
by our friend
from naval intelligence.

19:40.371 --> 19:41.438
Don't let him bother you,

19:41.506 --> 19:45.275
I'll give you
a character reference.

19:45.343 --> 19:46.844
I'm ready to run a geiger count

19:46.912 --> 19:48.211
on the stuff from los Alamos.

19:48.279 --> 19:53.684
Good, go ahead.

19:53.752 --> 19:55.886
That's strange.

19:55.954 --> 19:57.087
Is that the stuff from the boat?

19:57.155 --> 19:58.288
Yes.

19:58.356 --> 19:59.489
What's it register?

19:59.558 --> 20:00.758
0.15.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.826
And your last reading
on the salton sea?

20:02.894 --> 20:06.430
Normal, 0.034 constant.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.933
That's odd. This is
from the same water.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.338
Why the difference
in the radioactivity?

20:15.406 --> 20:17.726
We'd better run a check test.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.681
Hello, Larry.

20:40.749 --> 20:41.982
Mrs. Simms.

20:42.050 --> 20:44.518
Bob. What'll it be?

20:44.586 --> 20:46.153
We'd like to talk
about your beach.

20:46.221 --> 20:47.321
About my beach?

20:47.388 --> 20:48.956
I'm going now, ma.

20:49.024 --> 20:51.726
All right. Jody.

20:51.793 --> 20:52.793
Jody!

20:52.828 --> 20:55.596
Yes.

20:55.663 --> 20:56.663
Who you going out with?

20:56.698 --> 20:57.698
You know.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.900
I said, "who?"

20:59.968 --> 21:01.202
Morty.

21:01.269 --> 21:02.169
Morty.

21:02.237 --> 21:04.238
Sure, I might have known.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.806
I got nothing against
servicemen,

21:05.874 --> 21:07.241
but that morty's no good.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.308
You hear that?

21:08.376 --> 21:10.410
I hear.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.113
Ma, look at me.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.414
I'm a big girl now. Grown up.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.150
Can't you understand that?

21:16.218 --> 21:17.985
You won't pay attention
to me anymore.

21:18.053 --> 21:19.987
That isn't what I mean.

21:20.055 --> 21:21.088
I don't want to hurt you.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.723
But there are times
when I've got to

21:22.791 --> 21:24.792
use my own judgment
about things.

21:24.860 --> 21:31.048
It has to be that way.
Please try to understand.

21:31.116 --> 21:34.651
All right.
Just you get home early.

21:34.719 --> 21:36.987
I will.

21:37.054 --> 21:38.322
I got a terrible headache.

21:38.390 --> 21:39.456
I'm sorry, ma.

21:39.524 --> 21:40.691
Goodnight.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.259
You were saying?

21:42.327 --> 21:43.894
About your beach.

21:43.961 --> 21:46.129
I'm afraid you'll have to
close it up temporarily.

21:46.197 --> 21:47.864
No swimming.

21:59.093 --> 22:01.662
Mort?

22:01.730 --> 22:03.263
Mort?

22:03.331 --> 22:04.799
Where you been?

22:04.866 --> 22:08.903
Ma, she's...

22:08.970 --> 22:09.970
Ma what?

22:10.004 --> 22:11.104
Nothing.

22:11.172 --> 22:12.740
She's screaming
at everybody tonight.

22:12.808 --> 22:18.279
Forget it.

22:18.346 --> 22:21.015
Pretty girl. Ha.

22:21.082 --> 22:23.117
Pretty girl, where's your suit?

22:23.185 --> 22:27.487
Underneath, silly.

22:27.555 --> 22:31.058
It's sure a beautiful night.

22:31.126 --> 22:33.660
Did you get a look at that moon?

22:53.598 --> 22:54.932
Catch me.

23:15.319 --> 23:18.021
Come on. I'll race
you to the float.

23:18.089 --> 23:20.057
You haven't got a chance.

23:32.771 --> 23:34.938
Morty.

23:35.006 --> 23:38.508
Morty?

23:38.576 --> 23:39.576
Mort.

23:45.283 --> 23:47.151
Mort.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.218
Ah.

23:48.286 --> 23:50.821
Ah! Ah!

23:50.889 --> 23:56.026
Ah!

23:56.094 --> 23:58.595
I'll tell you what happened.

23:58.663 --> 24:00.864
That boy ran off
somewhere with Jody.

24:00.932 --> 24:02.032
I know it.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.466
He's no good.

24:03.534 --> 24:05.135
I warned her. I said,

24:05.203 --> 24:06.670
"why don't you go out
with a nice young man?"

24:06.737 --> 24:08.638
But no, she's just like
her father was:

24:08.706 --> 24:10.607
No sense.

24:10.675 --> 24:11.825
The boy didn't report back

24:11.893 --> 24:13.527
to the base at all last night.

24:13.595 --> 24:15.195
Are you sure he was
with your daughter?

24:15.263 --> 24:16.864
Of course I'm sure.

24:16.932 --> 24:18.331
Did you see him?

24:18.399 --> 24:20.200
I didn't have to see him.

24:20.268 --> 24:22.569
Jody herself told me
she was going out with him.

24:22.637 --> 24:24.371
Uppity as you please.

24:24.439 --> 24:26.941
And after all I've sacrificed
and done for her,

24:27.008 --> 24:28.659
not a word of appreciation.

24:28.726 --> 24:30.160
You'd think
that at least she'd...

24:30.228 --> 24:31.908
May we take a look around?

24:31.962 --> 24:33.997
No, go ahead.

24:34.065 --> 24:35.399
Her room's in there.

24:35.466 --> 24:36.433
<i>Let me have it.</i>

24:36.501 --> 24:37.167
<i>No, give it.</i>

24:37.235 --> 24:38.502
Wait a minute.

24:38.570 --> 24:40.187
I don't care. Give it to me.

24:40.254 --> 24:43.057
It's mine, I found it.

24:43.124 --> 24:45.325
There's some kids out there
with a sailor's cap.

24:45.393 --> 24:46.226
What?

24:46.294 --> 24:47.534
Some kids.

24:47.562 --> 24:49.162
What do kids got to do with it?

24:49.230 --> 24:51.632
I don't know.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.482
Give it to me.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.218
I don't care.

24:54.285 --> 24:57.054
Come here. Just a minute, son.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.890
Let me take a look at that cap.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.791
Did you find this cap?

25:01.860 --> 25:02.192
That boy, Freddy, was
trying to take it from me.

25:02.260 --> 25:05.162
Yes.

25:05.230 --> 25:06.363
Where'd you find it?

25:06.430 --> 25:08.298
Over there.

25:08.366 --> 25:10.300
It don't belong to nobody.

25:10.368 --> 25:12.369
It don't belong to you, does it?

25:12.436 --> 25:13.636
No, it doesn't.

25:13.704 --> 25:15.638
Will you show me
where you found this cap?

25:15.706 --> 25:17.241
Come on.

25:25.299 --> 25:26.600
There.

25:36.811 --> 25:37.911
What's that?

25:37.979 --> 25:40.981
A uniform or at
least part of one.

25:41.049 --> 25:42.582
Did your daughter
and her boyfriend

25:42.651 --> 25:43.931
ever swim here?

25:43.985 --> 25:51.985
Swim? I don't know.
You don't think they could...

25:52.193 --> 25:53.761
Jody!

25:53.828 --> 25:55.495
Jody!

25:55.563 --> 25:57.264
Oh.

25:57.331 --> 26:00.567
Oh, baby!

26:00.635 --> 26:01.818
I could cut out my tongue

26:01.886 --> 26:03.587
for the things I said to you.

26:14.549 --> 26:19.186
Oh, baby.

26:19.253 --> 26:21.121
Josh!

26:21.189 --> 26:22.856
Josh!

26:22.924 --> 26:23.924
What's up?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.225
I don't know.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.426
But that's the same thing

26:26.494 --> 26:28.996
we found on
the side of the boat.

26:29.064 --> 26:33.067
Dr. Rogers says
it's highly radioactive.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.614
I better call
and have him investigate

26:34.669 --> 26:36.136
the bottom of the sea,

26:36.204 --> 26:38.505
before somebody else is killed.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.809
Man, it's cold down there.

26:58.877 --> 27:00.844
I'll get price to
get you some coffee.

27:00.912 --> 27:02.345
Do you want us
to move out again?

27:02.413 --> 27:03.981
No, not yet.

27:04.048 --> 27:05.816
There's a rock formation
i want to check

27:05.884 --> 27:07.217
with a geiger counter.

27:07.284 --> 27:10.954
As soon as I fix my regulator.

27:11.022 --> 27:13.256
Thanks.

27:13.324 --> 27:14.725
Any sign of them?

27:14.792 --> 27:17.394
Nothing. Those kids are
probably off on a honeymoon.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.962
I hope so.

27:19.030 --> 27:19.930
That's it.

27:19.998 --> 27:22.032
Thanks.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.466
Okay, let's go.

27:23.535 --> 27:25.002
Keep a sharp eye, will you?

27:25.069 --> 27:27.037
Believe me,
we haven't seen a thing,

27:27.104 --> 27:29.105
except a few fish
the size of your left hand.

27:29.173 --> 27:30.507
Fine. Just be careful.

27:30.575 --> 27:31.942
Sure thing.

27:45.856 --> 27:47.324
How rough does it usually get?

27:47.392 --> 27:48.659
It depends on the wind.

27:48.726 --> 27:50.594
As a rule, there's
not much current.

27:50.662 --> 27:52.062
Then if the bodies
are down there,

27:52.129 --> 27:53.664
they'll be easy to find.

27:53.731 --> 27:56.533
Should be. Unless...

27:56.601 --> 27:58.768
Unless what?

27:58.836 --> 28:01.036
I'd rather not conjecture.

28:19.891 --> 28:20.824
Okay?

28:20.892 --> 28:22.259
Yes, sir.

28:22.327 --> 28:24.328
We've got you on the frequency.

28:24.395 --> 28:25.329
<i>Right.</i>

28:25.396 --> 28:27.630
<i>We're still descending.</i>

28:27.698 --> 28:29.132
What's your depth?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.840
<i>40 feet.</i>

28:38.943 --> 28:41.328
<i>60 feet. We're leveling off.</i>

28:41.395 --> 28:43.196
Good. Try a reading.

28:56.194 --> 28:57.827
<i>Doctor, I'm now checking</i>

28:57.896 --> 28:59.296
<i>the rock formation.</i>

28:59.364 --> 29:01.031
<i>Reading is normal.</i>

29:01.099 --> 29:03.833
Normal. Good.
What's the bottom like?

29:15.646 --> 29:17.606
<i>Doctor, about the same.</i>

29:26.273 --> 29:27.908
<i>We're going down again.</i>

29:27.975 --> 29:29.175
<i>It looks like there may be</i>

29:29.243 --> 29:30.810
<i>some kind of cave out under us.</i>

29:40.454 --> 29:41.538
How deep are you?

29:41.606 --> 29:43.039
<i>80 feet.</i>

29:43.107 --> 29:44.441
<i>Still dropping.</i>

29:44.509 --> 29:45.742
That's most unusual.

29:45.810 --> 29:46.810
Why?

29:46.877 --> 29:48.612
We've been over
this area a dozen times,

29:48.680 --> 29:51.315
the maximum depth is 65 feet.

29:51.382 --> 29:52.716
Don't take any chances.

29:52.784 --> 29:58.438
<i>Don't worry.</i>

29:58.506 --> 30:01.741
<i>97 feet.</i>

30:01.809 --> 30:03.210
<i>100.</i>

30:08.950 --> 30:10.349
<i>125.</i>

30:19.993 --> 30:21.294
<i>We've leveled off again.</i>

30:21.361 --> 30:22.896
<i>I think we're at the bottom</i>

30:22.964 --> 30:25.164
<i>of some kind of huge cavern.</i>

30:25.232 --> 30:28.401
<i>We see some kind
of peculiar object ahead.</i>

30:28.469 --> 30:29.502
<i>Hang on.</i>

31:02.653 --> 31:06.640
<i>Doctor, I get
a reading of 1.038.</i>

31:06.707 --> 31:07.741
What is it?

31:07.808 --> 31:09.008
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

31:09.076 --> 31:10.777
<i>Some kind
of marine growth, I think.</i>

31:10.844 --> 31:14.281
<i>Circular. About 6 feet.
Almost transparent.</i>

31:14.348 --> 31:15.882
<i>We'll try to cut it loose.</i>

31:15.949 --> 31:17.651
I'll send down a net.

31:17.718 --> 31:19.486
Lower the net, boys.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.996
<i>Okay. Take it up.</i>

32:06.167 --> 32:07.967
Is everything all right?

32:08.035 --> 32:09.135
<i>No problems.</i>

32:09.203 --> 32:11.437
<i>We're still looking.</i>

32:11.505 --> 32:13.940
Hold off and come up till
we check what's in the net.

32:14.008 --> 32:15.528
<i>Okay.</i>

32:43.554 --> 32:45.672
<i>We've found the girl.</i>

32:45.740 --> 32:47.407
Can you get her up quickly?

32:47.475 --> 32:49.275
<i>It'll only take a minute.</i>

32:49.343 --> 32:50.977
Okay, but don't take any longer.

33:06.377 --> 33:08.177
<i>My tank.</i>

33:08.245 --> 33:09.546
What' s wrong?

33:09.614 --> 33:10.814
<i>Blake's tank is caught</i>

33:10.882 --> 33:12.348
<i>in the undergrowth.</i>

33:12.416 --> 33:13.583
Do you need any help?

33:13.651 --> 33:14.851
<i>No, we're okay.</i>

33:54.858 --> 33:56.075
<i>Oh!</i>

33:56.143 --> 33:57.710
Johns!

33:57.778 --> 34:00.430
Johns!

34:00.731 --> 34:02.449
Answer me, Johns!

34:02.516 --> 34:06.953
<i>I'm okay. It got Blake.</i>

34:07.020 --> 34:08.922
What're you talking about?

34:08.989 --> 34:10.989
<i>I'm coming up. Get help.</i>

34:29.594 --> 34:30.525
Oh, my god.

34:30.594 --> 34:31.628
What happened?

34:31.696 --> 34:33.295
Oh, my god. His body.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.864
He died right in front of me.
I couldn't help him.

34:35.933 --> 34:37.233
I've got to go back.

34:37.301 --> 34:38.735
Talk sense. What's down there?

34:38.803 --> 34:40.904
I don't know, I never
saw anything like it.

34:40.972 --> 34:41.920
Like what?

34:41.989 --> 34:44.489
A creature. A giant creature.

34:44.558 --> 34:46.025
You're not going
back down there.

34:46.092 --> 34:47.760
Take your hands off me,
i 've got to kill it!

34:47.828 --> 34:50.679
I said, "you're not
going back down!"

34:50.748 --> 34:52.716
Stay out of this,
I'll take care of him.

34:52.783 --> 34:54.016
There's no time for hysterics.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.318
What are we fighting?

34:55.386 --> 34:57.018
I don't know.

34:57.087 --> 34:59.222
Was there just one
of these creatures?

34:59.290 --> 35:03.192
I think so. There was a cave,

35:03.261 --> 35:05.762
outside

35:05.829 --> 35:10.783
that thing.

35:10.851 --> 35:11.951
An egg.

35:12.019 --> 35:16.089
That must be one of its eggs.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.556
Behind you!

35:34.642 --> 35:37.202
The eye. Get the eye!

36:09.843 --> 36:12.027
Keep those depth charges moving.

36:12.095 --> 36:14.096
Hurry up, boys,
we don't have much time.

36:14.164 --> 36:16.198
The commander wants to leave
in 5 minutes.

36:16.266 --> 36:18.033
The Pentagon is sending
admiral greenhouse

36:18.101 --> 36:19.535
for the conference.

36:19.603 --> 36:20.936
Good. We're keeping the egg

36:21.004 --> 36:22.672
in the lab under observation.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.273
We should know
more about it by then.

36:24.341 --> 36:26.008
I issued a press release saying

36:26.076 --> 36:27.744
the Navy
is conducting routine tests

36:27.811 --> 36:29.078
with underwater explosives.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.713
That should cover us
for the moment.

36:30.781 --> 36:32.382
No sense in starting a panic.

36:32.449 --> 36:33.583
Excuse me, sir.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.700
They're about finished loading.

36:34.769 --> 36:35.935
You want to take a look?

36:36.003 --> 36:41.574
Be about 5 minutes,
doctor. Excuse me.

36:41.642 --> 36:43.042
Would you sign these?

36:43.110 --> 36:44.544
Did you get a hold of Connie?

36:44.612 --> 36:46.912
No, but I left word for
her to come down here.

36:46.980 --> 36:48.314
Thank you.

36:48.382 --> 36:50.082
If you have any problems,
let us know.

36:50.151 --> 36:51.451
The chief of staff
has authorized

36:51.519 --> 36:53.353
full cooperation.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.521
We'll see you in the morning.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.189
Thank you, captain.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.204
What's going on?

37:28.272 --> 37:30.873
Did Mars finally invade us?

37:30.941 --> 37:33.443
Another secret?

37:33.510 --> 37:37.130
Where's George?

37:37.198 --> 37:38.731
Where's George?

37:38.799 --> 37:42.835
Connie, I couldn't help it.

37:42.903 --> 37:43.970
Where's George?

37:44.037 --> 37:45.371
What's happened to my husband?

37:45.439 --> 37:48.241
Connie, step in here
with me for a moment.

37:56.484 --> 37:57.783
Where's Dr. Rogers?

37:57.851 --> 38:00.019
He's in the radio shack.

38:00.087 --> 38:01.354
He's with Connie.

38:01.422 --> 38:03.723
Oh.

38:03.790 --> 38:05.291
We're about ready to shove off.

38:05.359 --> 38:07.160
Leave them alone, please.

38:17.337 --> 38:18.738
Are you all right?

38:18.806 --> 38:20.707
I'm fine.

38:20.774 --> 38:22.408
I don't think you are.

38:22.476 --> 38:24.210
What's wrong?

38:24.277 --> 38:25.945
I should be with Connie,

38:26.013 --> 38:28.180
telling her how you get over it.

38:28.248 --> 38:29.482
The trouble is, you don't.

38:29.550 --> 38:31.484
I mean, I didn't.

38:31.552 --> 38:32.685
Would you like a cigarette?

38:32.753 --> 38:34.320
No, thank you.

38:34.388 --> 38:35.388
When tom was killed,

38:35.456 --> 38:37.323
they said all
those things to me.

38:37.391 --> 38:38.324
Tom?

38:38.392 --> 38:40.160
My husband.

38:40.227 --> 38:42.895
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

38:42.963 --> 38:44.697
It's funny,
you go around for days

38:44.765 --> 38:45.998
and you don't believe it.

38:46.066 --> 38:47.600
You think it can't be true.

38:47.668 --> 38:49.536
And one of those days
you get to thinking,

38:49.603 --> 38:52.539
"it is true.
He isn't coming home."

38:52.606 --> 38:56.609
And you say it out loud,
"he isn't coming home."

38:56.677 --> 38:58.611
Don't listen to me,
I'm over it now.

38:58.679 --> 39:00.446
It was 2 years ago.

39:00.514 --> 39:02.182
I couldn't go in there
with Connie.

39:02.249 --> 39:03.816
Not right now.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.518
What did your husband do?

39:05.586 --> 39:06.653
He was a pilot.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.555
He was stationed in San Diego.

39:08.622 --> 39:11.874
Sandy and I moved
here afterwards.

39:11.942 --> 39:13.176
It takes a great deal of courage

39:13.243 --> 39:15.178
to start over.

39:15.245 --> 39:17.847
I had a lot of happiness,
a lot of things

39:17.915 --> 39:19.515
to think about and remember.

39:19.582 --> 39:22.185
And I had Sandy.
I couldn't fall apart.

39:22.252 --> 39:23.485
I guess not.

39:23.553 --> 39:26.488
You know something?
You're easy to talk to,

39:26.556 --> 39:29.175
and I didn't think you would be.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.342
Gail.

39:30.410 --> 39:33.412
Yes, doctor.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.114
Would you take care
of Connie, please?

39:35.182 --> 39:36.649
Of course.

39:36.717 --> 39:39.886
We're waiting for you,
doctor. How is she?

39:39.954 --> 39:41.588
She's resting.
She'll be all right.

39:41.655 --> 39:46.692
Good.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.561
Men, Dr. Rogers has

39:48.629 --> 39:50.463
some final instructions for you.

39:50.531 --> 39:52.031
Everything that's happened,

39:52.098 --> 39:54.033
or that will happen
on this expedition,

39:54.100 --> 39:57.970
is classified
"top secret." Is that clear?

39:58.038 --> 39:59.605
We've crippled
and may have killed

39:59.673 --> 40:00.740
this giant creature.

40:00.808 --> 40:02.308
To make sure it's dead,
we're going

40:02.375 --> 40:04.977
to saturate the area
with depth charges.

40:05.045 --> 40:06.345
But our most important job

40:06.413 --> 40:07.747
is to find all its eggs.

40:07.815 --> 40:09.181
Once they're located,

40:09.249 --> 40:11.050
Dr. Johns will make
a quick survey of them

40:11.117 --> 40:13.285
and then they must
be totally destroyed.

40:13.353 --> 40:14.720
Cmdr. Twillinger
will be in charge

40:14.788 --> 40:16.789
of the underwater demolition.

40:16.857 --> 40:18.057
I guess that's all.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.124
All right, men. Let's go.

40:32.539 --> 40:34.340
Believe me, it's best for you

40:34.407 --> 40:35.708
to stay here tonight.

40:35.776 --> 40:38.344
I've got plenty of room.

40:40.647 --> 40:41.914
What are they doing?

40:41.982 --> 40:46.118
Come on.

40:46.186 --> 40:47.252
What you see here

40:47.320 --> 40:48.420
is the formation

40:48.489 --> 40:49.856
inside the egg sac

40:49.923 --> 40:52.191
we found near the
creature's lair.

40:52.258 --> 40:54.794
You'll notice the shell
is beginning to harden.

40:54.862 --> 40:57.497
There's quite a bit
of definition in the head.

40:57.564 --> 40:59.499
Until our studies are completed,

40:59.566 --> 41:01.166
we're keeping it alive
by controlled

41:01.234 --> 41:02.635
water temperature.

41:02.703 --> 41:04.537
You'll notice that
the thermostat reads

41:04.605 --> 41:07.072
38 degrees exactly.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.174
Is there any danger
that the egg might hatch?

41:09.242 --> 41:10.943
No, the temperature
is low enough

41:11.011 --> 41:12.311
to keep it from hatching.

41:12.379 --> 41:13.880
As long as this knob is set

41:13.947 --> 41:15.715
so the temperature
remains constant,

41:15.782 --> 41:16.782
there'll be no problem.

41:16.850 --> 41:17.984
I see.

41:18.051 --> 41:20.252
Gentlemen, we believe
that this creature

41:20.320 --> 41:22.187
is of the same family as

41:22.255 --> 41:24.423
the historically
documented kraken.

41:24.491 --> 41:26.559
A giant sea beast
that was the direct

41:26.627 --> 41:28.928
ancestor of the modern
water mollusk.

41:28.996 --> 41:30.863
I've had some film
of common mollusks

41:30.931 --> 41:32.598
flown in from San Diego.

41:32.666 --> 41:34.500
I'd like you to compare it

41:34.568 --> 41:36.235
with the creature
that attacked us.

41:36.302 --> 41:37.236
Dr. Johns?

41:37.303 --> 41:42.975
Yes. Right this way, please.

41:43.043 --> 41:49.281
Sheriff, would you
cut the lights, please?

41:49.349 --> 41:50.783
As most of you know,

41:50.851 --> 41:52.317
the mollusk family

41:52.385 --> 41:55.755
is comprised of animals
with a soft body

41:55.822 --> 41:59.825
usually covered by a hard shell.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.562
This is gonaxis kibweziensis.

42:02.629 --> 42:04.730
It's one half inch in diameter.

42:04.798 --> 42:07.433
You'll note the similarities
between it

42:07.501 --> 42:10.520
and the giant creature
in the salton sea.

42:10.587 --> 42:11.654
For example,

42:11.722 --> 42:14.223
the gonaxis has
a predatory nature.

42:14.291 --> 42:16.158
It attacks other
living creatures,

42:16.226 --> 42:18.994
will devour them,
eat their flesh.

42:19.062 --> 42:22.932
The larger it is,
the larger its appetite.

42:22.934 --> 42:24.483
This is a branch of the gonaxis,

42:24.551 --> 42:26.352
the euglandia.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.654
It shreds the flesh
of its victim

42:28.722 --> 42:30.523
with scissor-like teeth.

42:30.591 --> 42:33.659
Some species suck out
the body fluids

42:33.727 --> 42:34.827
in much the same manner

42:34.894 --> 42:37.330
as the creature
with which we're dealing.

42:37.397 --> 42:39.214
As I mentioned,
most of these creatures

42:39.282 --> 42:41.450
live entirely in the water.

42:41.518 --> 42:43.953
But it's not unusual
to find them on land,

42:44.020 --> 42:46.922
searching for food.

42:46.924 --> 42:51.226
The same thing
is true of our kraken.

42:51.294 --> 42:52.394
These mollusks

42:52.462 --> 42:54.363
are only recently hatched,

42:54.430 --> 42:56.732
yet they're as large
as the adult.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.067
The reason being
that they developed

42:59.135 --> 43:02.237
to full growth
within the egg sac.

43:02.305 --> 43:03.422
From the instant they're born,

43:03.490 --> 43:06.225
they're hungry.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.927
That bubbly secretion you see

43:07.995 --> 43:09.662
is formed
in the digestive system.

43:09.730 --> 43:12.531
It acts as a defensive weapon.

43:12.599 --> 43:15.200
Incidentally,
it's chemically similar to

43:15.268 --> 43:19.555
the secretion
we found on the boat.

43:19.623 --> 43:21.791
That'll give you an idea.

43:21.859 --> 43:23.993
It's interesting,
but what's the point?

43:24.060 --> 43:25.361
The creature was killed

43:25.429 --> 43:27.730
and all the eggs were destroyed.

43:27.798 --> 43:29.699
That's right, but we're not sure

43:29.767 --> 43:31.300
we destroyed all the
other creatures.

43:31.368 --> 43:32.608
Do you think that more than one

43:32.636 --> 43:33.636
has developed?

43:33.670 --> 43:35.170
We're sure of it.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.272
From the number of shells

43:36.339 --> 43:37.339
in these photographs,

43:37.374 --> 43:38.808
I'd say there are at least 10

43:38.876 --> 43:40.075
of these giant creatures,

43:40.143 --> 43:42.545
each one with the capacity

43:42.613 --> 43:44.480
to lay several thousand

43:44.548 --> 43:45.581
eggs in its life cycle.

43:45.649 --> 43:48.017
There was a cave here

43:48.084 --> 43:50.252
which we sealed with explosives

43:50.320 --> 43:52.021
and probably trapped
the rest of them inside.

43:52.088 --> 43:53.623
We have to be sure, doctor.

43:53.690 --> 43:55.491
That's impossible,
because the mouth

43:55.559 --> 43:56.559
of that cave

43:56.627 --> 43:57.727
is covered with tons of rock.

43:57.795 --> 43:59.395
If any did escape,

43:59.463 --> 44:01.363
it will have to surface
sooner or later.

44:01.432 --> 44:02.498
It won't find enough food

44:02.566 --> 44:04.199
in the salton sea,
it'll get hungry.

44:04.267 --> 44:07.202
We can keep a 24-hour
beach patrol.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.705
Yes, I think that's imperative.

44:09.773 --> 44:12.240
But our real danger
doesn't lie at the sea.

44:12.308 --> 44:14.209
Let's remember
that these creatures

44:14.277 --> 44:16.244
can travel overland, too.

44:16.312 --> 44:17.697
A few miles from here

44:17.764 --> 44:19.164
is the all-American
canal system,

44:19.232 --> 44:21.701
which irrigates
the entire imperial valley

44:21.768 --> 44:24.303
and then in time
empties into the Gulf.

44:24.371 --> 44:26.505
I don't want
to alarm you unduly,

44:26.573 --> 44:29.408
but if just one
of these creatures lived

44:29.476 --> 44:30.876
and got by the patrols,

44:30.944 --> 44:32.845
into the canal system
and multiplied,

44:32.912 --> 44:35.214
the species could threaten
the entire world.

44:35.281 --> 44:37.282
First, devouring all life
in the oceans

44:37.350 --> 44:40.019
and then, foraging on land.

44:40.087 --> 44:42.021
Can you imagine
an army of these things

44:42.089 --> 44:44.090
descending on one of our cities?

44:44.157 --> 44:46.158
What caused it?
Where'd they come from?

44:46.226 --> 44:48.527
We don't know,
we can only guess.

44:48.595 --> 44:52.949
Perhaps you saw
this article here in <i>life.</i>

44:53.016 --> 44:54.951
A few miles from here,

44:55.018 --> 44:57.353
this lakebed existed
in a dry state,

44:57.420 --> 44:59.188
void of life for many years.

44:59.255 --> 45:02.124
Then a flash flood filled it
with about 2 feet of water.

45:02.192 --> 45:03.432
In a few days,

45:03.494 --> 45:05.327
there were millions
of shrimp in that lake.

45:05.395 --> 45:06.796
They hatched from dormant eggs

45:06.864 --> 45:08.397
that were there for centuries.

45:08.465 --> 45:11.000
I believe the same thing
happened here.

45:11.067 --> 45:12.635
I think that a pocket of eggs

45:12.703 --> 45:14.504
from this prehistoric species

45:14.571 --> 45:15.571
was trapped here,

45:15.639 --> 45:17.573
below the bottom
of the salton sea.

45:17.641 --> 45:20.342
Suppose an earthquake
caused a fissure to open

45:20.410 --> 45:22.612
at the bottom of the sea,
allowing water

45:22.679 --> 45:24.113
to seep down to this pocket.

45:24.180 --> 45:26.883
Because this water was
slightly radioactive,

45:26.950 --> 45:28.618
and because the eggs
had a capacity

45:28.685 --> 45:30.386
to absorb this radioactivity,

45:30.453 --> 45:32.121
they found
an environment that was

45:32.188 --> 45:34.423
perfect in which
to hatch and grow.

45:34.491 --> 45:35.892
Then a more severe earthquake

45:35.959 --> 45:37.393
widened the fissure,

45:37.460 --> 45:40.429
allowing these creatures
to escape into the sea.

45:40.497 --> 45:43.098
I'd like to alert
the civilian defense.

45:43.166 --> 45:45.768
Mr. Patterson, there are
100,000 people in this valley.

45:45.836 --> 45:47.837
A move like that would
lead to hysteria.

45:47.905 --> 45:49.271
I suppose that's true.

45:49.339 --> 45:51.440
I think we should
set up a joint patrol

45:51.508 --> 45:52.708
around the sea,

45:52.776 --> 45:54.977
combine your staff
with the sheriff's office,

45:55.045 --> 45:56.679
set up a headquarters
at the air base

45:56.747 --> 45:58.380
and coordinate from there.

45:58.448 --> 45:59.916
Does that sound
practical to you?

45:59.983 --> 46:00.883
Yes, sir.

46:00.951 --> 46:02.117
How about your office, sheriff?

46:02.185 --> 46:03.452
Sounds fine to me.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.155
I'm due to report back
to joint chiefs of staff.

46:06.222 --> 46:08.123
I'll tell them that
even if there are

46:08.191 --> 46:09.258
some surviving creatures,

46:09.325 --> 46:10.960
there's still
no national danger.

46:11.028 --> 46:13.763
Unless, as you said, some escape

46:13.830 --> 46:15.965
from the sea into
the all-American canal.

46:16.033 --> 46:17.232
That's correct.

46:17.300 --> 46:18.740
I'll be in touch
with you, commander.

46:18.802 --> 46:20.335
Call me if anything develops.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.537
Very good, sir.

46:21.605 --> 46:22.672
Good day, gentlemen.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.206
Good day. Good day.

46:24.274 --> 46:25.875
The governor
advised me to offer you

46:25.943 --> 46:27.443
any assistance you may need.

46:27.510 --> 46:29.545
We appreciate that
very much, thank you.

46:29.613 --> 46:30.613
Yes, doctor.

46:30.647 --> 46:32.114
I think we'd better
meet in my office

46:32.182 --> 46:33.082
to set this up.

46:33.149 --> 46:37.519
Okay.

46:37.588 --> 46:38.520
Good night.

46:38.589 --> 46:42.091
Good night.

46:42.158 --> 46:43.826
Gail, how's Connie?

46:43.894 --> 46:45.461
All right. She's staying with me

46:45.528 --> 46:46.295
for a while.

46:46.362 --> 46:47.597
Good.

46:47.664 --> 46:49.999
I feel kind of embarrassed
today, commander.

46:50.067 --> 46:51.166
Why?

46:51.234 --> 46:53.636
The personal things
i said yesterday,

46:53.704 --> 46:55.170
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

46:55.238 --> 46:56.271
You didn't.

46:56.339 --> 46:58.140
I don't usually
carry on that way.

46:58.208 --> 47:01.410
You ought to, at least
once in a while.

47:01.478 --> 47:03.412
We're on our way back
to the base now,

47:03.480 --> 47:06.515
and we have to eat sometime.

47:06.583 --> 47:08.517
What I mean is,
why don't you let me

47:08.585 --> 47:09.852
take you to dinner tonight?

47:09.920 --> 47:12.655
I found a wonderful place
to eat in mexicali.

47:12.723 --> 47:14.556
Thank you, but i
can't leave Connie.

47:14.625 --> 47:15.858
I mean, I shouldn't.

47:15.926 --> 47:16.692
Okay.

47:16.760 --> 47:17.860
I'm awfully sorry.

47:17.928 --> 47:19.228
If you should
change your mind...

47:19.295 --> 47:20.329
I never do.

47:20.396 --> 47:22.999
If you should, the number's 254.

47:23.066 --> 47:24.399
254.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.102
You already have it.

47:26.169 --> 47:28.470
So I have.

47:28.538 --> 47:29.588
Good night.

47:29.656 --> 47:30.936
Good night.

48:01.537 --> 48:03.377
<i>Anything happening?</i>

48:03.439 --> 48:06.608
Nothing. Nothing but moonlight.

48:06.676 --> 48:09.178
<i>Wallace and hanson
will replace you at 10:00.</i>

48:09.246 --> 48:10.146
<i>Thanks.</i>

48:10.213 --> 48:11.747
Okay.

48:11.815 --> 48:13.482
That about ties it up.

48:13.549 --> 48:15.284
This reminds me of last year.

48:15.351 --> 48:16.218
We had a stakeout

48:16.286 --> 48:17.887
on a federal bank for 3 months.

48:17.954 --> 48:18.754
What happened?

48:18.822 --> 48:20.122
Not a thing.

48:20.190 --> 48:21.323
You sure you won't come home

48:21.391 --> 48:22.258
and take potluck?

48:22.325 --> 48:23.159
Jenny wouldn't mind.

48:23.226 --> 48:24.059
Much.

48:24.127 --> 48:25.828
No, come on!

48:25.896 --> 48:27.596
No, I'll get something
from the cafeteria.

48:27.664 --> 48:28.730
Okay, see you later.

48:28.799 --> 48:31.984
You bet.

48:32.052 --> 48:33.152
This is just like that

48:33.219 --> 48:35.821
federal bank stakeout last year.

48:35.889 --> 48:38.057
The only trouble is,
nothing ever happens.

48:45.531 --> 48:48.701
No, mom.

48:48.768 --> 48:52.404
I don't know. Yes, I'll hurry.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.539
No, I don't know how late.

48:54.607 --> 48:58.210
<i>This is Walker,
section 5 north. All clear.</i>

48:58.277 --> 48:59.277
Check.

49:01.681 --> 49:04.482
Oni, twillinger.

49:04.550 --> 49:05.684
Hi.

49:05.752 --> 49:07.502
I had to come to town
with some reports

49:07.570 --> 49:09.205
for the doctor.

49:09.272 --> 49:10.973
I know it's past dinnertime,

49:11.041 --> 49:13.075
but if you hadn't
already eaten, I...

49:13.376 --> 49:17.362
Yeah, I'm starving.
Where are you?

49:17.430 --> 49:19.364
Right, I know where it is.

49:19.432 --> 49:20.899
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

49:20.967 --> 49:23.835
Right, goodbye.

49:23.903 --> 49:25.337
I'll check with you
in half an hour.

49:25.405 --> 49:26.638
Okay.

49:36.549 --> 49:40.252
You can take mine, too, please.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.354
You certainly
don't eat very much.

49:42.422 --> 49:44.789
I don't know how you keep going.

49:44.857 --> 49:47.459
I had a big lunch.

49:47.527 --> 49:49.060
That reminds me,

49:49.129 --> 49:50.462
I'd better check in
to base again.

49:50.530 --> 49:55.367
Excuse me.

49:55.435 --> 49:58.203
♪

50:26.065 --> 50:30.068
Nothing's happened so far,
nothing at all.

50:30.136 --> 50:32.037
Did you make a wish?

50:32.104 --> 50:35.174
Yes.

50:35.241 --> 50:38.910
I've got a confession to make.

50:38.978 --> 50:41.346
I bet I know what it is.

50:41.414 --> 50:42.414
You're still hungry.

50:42.482 --> 50:46.518
No.

50:46.586 --> 50:48.520
What I said about
coming into town

50:48.588 --> 50:49.655
wasn't true.

50:49.722 --> 50:51.956
I went home and Connie
felt like being alone

50:52.024 --> 50:54.393
so that made me
feel lonely, too.

50:54.460 --> 50:56.528
So I decided to call you.

50:56.596 --> 50:57.862
That's not a confession,

50:57.930 --> 51:01.466
that's a compliment.

51:01.534 --> 51:03.001
You want a ballpoint pen, <i>senor</i> ?

51:03.069 --> 51:04.069
What?

51:04.103 --> 51:06.205
Very cheap, <i>senor.</i> 8 pesos.

51:06.272 --> 51:07.306
Big bargain.

51:07.373 --> 51:08.139
No, thanks.

51:08.208 --> 51:09.007
<i>Si!</i>

51:09.075 --> 51:09.808
No.

51:09.875 --> 51:11.009
Much ink inside.

51:11.077 --> 51:12.317
No, thank you.

51:12.378 --> 51:16.081
She will write 2 million
miles, no refills.

51:16.148 --> 51:17.482
How much is 8 pesos?

51:17.550 --> 51:18.950
65 cents.

51:19.018 --> 51:20.485
All right, bud.

51:20.553 --> 51:22.020
You got yourself a deal.

51:22.088 --> 51:23.622
Thank you, <i>senor.</i>

51:23.690 --> 51:27.459
Hey, kid, my pen!

51:27.527 --> 51:28.627
What are you grinning at?

51:28.695 --> 51:29.894
Twill.

51:29.962 --> 51:31.263
What's so funny?

51:31.331 --> 51:32.651
That kid walked off
with my money.

51:32.699 --> 51:35.133
Your face. You're so serious.

51:35.201 --> 51:37.001
Big bargain.

51:37.069 --> 51:39.804
You're really much too serious.

51:39.872 --> 51:41.373
Maybe you're right.

51:41.441 --> 51:43.575
But I don't think you're
like that underneath.

51:43.643 --> 51:46.294
What did you want to do
when you were little?

51:46.362 --> 51:49.197
First, I wanted to be a fireman,

51:49.265 --> 51:52.101
and then a forest ranger,

51:52.168 --> 51:54.269
then I guess
i wanted to be a cop.

51:54.337 --> 51:55.638
Really?

51:55.705 --> 51:56.739
Mm-hmm.

52:01.761 --> 52:04.263
<i>Senor,</i> look, you like red?

52:04.330 --> 52:06.899
I got red, white, green,
blue, red and white,

52:06.966 --> 52:08.286
black and white, green and red...

52:08.334 --> 52:09.434
Blue and white.

52:09.502 --> 52:12.704
No blue and white.
Red, red and white,

52:12.772 --> 52:14.092
black and white, green and red...

52:14.140 --> 52:17.276
Look, I'll just take this one.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.744
Go on, scoot. Shoo!

52:19.812 --> 52:21.413
Thank you,<i> senor!</i>

52:26.619 --> 52:27.685
Where were we?

52:27.753 --> 52:29.754
You were just going
to take me home.

52:29.822 --> 52:34.726
I'm afraid it's
getting very late.

52:34.794 --> 52:36.395
It's only 10:15.

52:42.785 --> 52:45.253
Want to stop at the
four oaks for a beer?

52:45.321 --> 52:47.823
I told Betty I'd come
right home after our shift.

52:47.890 --> 52:49.858
So you'll be half an hour late.

52:49.926 --> 52:51.193
Take the canal cutoff

52:51.260 --> 52:52.828
and we'll be there in 5 minutes.

53:02.956 --> 53:07.726
Check that car ahead.

53:07.794 --> 53:08.927
You better take a look.

53:08.995 --> 53:10.035
Yeah.

54:01.313 --> 54:02.981
What happened? What's wrong?

54:03.049 --> 54:05.984
It. It was...

54:06.052 --> 54:07.385
Better get him to the hospital.

54:07.453 --> 54:08.554
Radio headquarters. Right.

54:08.621 --> 54:12.457
No! Mary Jean.

54:12.525 --> 54:14.560
Mary Jean.

54:31.911 --> 54:33.912
It could have gone
a dozen different ways.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.013
Every half-mile,

54:35.081 --> 54:36.761
there's a junction
and the locks roll open.

54:36.816 --> 54:38.317
I don't understand.

54:38.384 --> 54:39.884
Did you check
all the patrols on the sea?

54:39.952 --> 54:41.920
Yes, they're certain
nothing got past them.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.922
It's 23 miles
from that sea to that canal,

54:43.989 --> 54:47.993
and there's
no connection by water.

54:48.061 --> 54:50.228
I just got a report.
A farmer 15 miles

54:50.296 --> 54:51.964
from here found
2 of his cattle dead.

54:52.031 --> 54:53.264
Shriveled up.
He thinks they were

54:53.332 --> 54:55.249
attacked about 10:00 last night.

54:55.317 --> 54:57.853
10:00? How's that possible?

54:57.920 --> 54:59.087
We know that the boy and girl

54:59.154 --> 55:00.655
were attacked here at 10:00.

55:00.723 --> 55:02.457
Of course. There must be

55:02.525 --> 55:03.658
an underground
river through which

55:03.726 --> 55:04.726
they escaped.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.327
A river that leads from the sea

55:06.395 --> 55:08.563
to one of the pools
near the canal area.

55:08.631 --> 55:10.131
They leave this pool at night,

55:10.199 --> 55:12.601
and come around the
canals in search of food.

55:12.668 --> 55:15.604
We'll have to patrol
the entire canal system.

55:15.671 --> 55:17.589
There's 700 miles of canal bank

55:17.657 --> 55:19.891
in this county alone.
That could take us days.

55:19.959 --> 55:22.193
We don't have days.
The egg at the lab

55:22.262 --> 55:23.828
was almost hatching
when we got it.

55:23.896 --> 55:25.764
We must find their new nest,

55:25.831 --> 55:27.532
before they lay any more eggs.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.134
I'll call air national guard.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.835
Their helicopters
will work with ours.

55:30.903 --> 55:32.537
We'll check every pool
in this valley

55:32.605 --> 55:33.772
for their secretion.

55:33.839 --> 55:35.823
Good. Because
the possibility of finding

55:35.892 --> 55:37.893
one pool out of
thousands is remote.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.720
There's the chance
that there may be

55:39.762 --> 55:40.862
an old survey map

55:40.930 --> 55:42.764
that shows where
this underground river

55:42.831 --> 55:44.666
empties into the pool.

55:44.734 --> 55:46.134
Doctor, if there is such a map,

55:46.201 --> 55:48.102
we'll find it.

55:48.170 --> 55:50.238
Come on, we'll use our car.

56:05.555 --> 56:08.623
This is helicopter 2-5,
reporting in.

56:08.691 --> 56:10.926
We have covered south basin.

56:10.993 --> 56:13.227
There is no sign of target pool.

56:13.295 --> 56:15.695
Bearing south-southeast.

56:26.541 --> 56:28.109
Well, now,

56:28.176 --> 56:30.011
we gave most
of our map collection

56:30.078 --> 56:31.311
to the library.

56:31.379 --> 56:33.280
We've already been
to the library.

56:33.348 --> 56:34.749
We've checked
every possible source.

56:34.816 --> 56:36.216
You're our last resort.

56:36.284 --> 56:37.484
Too bad.

56:37.552 --> 56:39.020
We don't have many documents.

56:39.087 --> 56:40.587
We don't have room for them.

56:40.656 --> 56:44.125
We put up a bond issue,
proposition 14-a,

56:44.192 --> 56:47.427
specifically asking
for a document room.

56:47.495 --> 56:49.263
Here.

56:49.330 --> 56:55.402
Here we are.

56:55.470 --> 56:56.537
Is this all you have?

56:56.604 --> 56:59.339
I'm sorry.
Just not a speck of room.

56:59.407 --> 57:01.542
Mr. dobbs, this is
very important.

57:01.609 --> 57:03.644
Have you heard of an
underground river

57:03.712 --> 57:05.012
or ancient waterway

57:05.080 --> 57:06.113
that runs through the valley

57:06.181 --> 57:07.748
that would empty
into a deep pool?

57:07.816 --> 57:11.218
Dear, let me think.

57:11.286 --> 57:13.788
I can't think of a thing.

57:13.855 --> 57:16.824
But every once
in a while, somebody dies

57:16.892 --> 57:18.659
and leaves us
a whole lot of documents

57:18.727 --> 57:19.827
for our room,

57:19.895 --> 57:22.096
the one we didn't get,
you understand.

57:22.164 --> 57:24.598
Proposition 14-a was defeated.

57:24.666 --> 57:26.000
If you hear anything,

57:26.068 --> 57:27.168
you can get me at the air base.

57:27.235 --> 57:28.235
Air base?

57:28.303 --> 57:29.503
Yeah, El centro.

57:29.571 --> 57:33.240
Sure. I always cooperate
with the authorities.

57:33.308 --> 57:35.776
You'll find I'm a very
cooperative person.

57:35.844 --> 57:36.944
Thank you, Mr. dobbs.

57:37.012 --> 57:39.980
Just call on me
anytime. Night or day.

58:33.051 --> 58:36.953
Give me Navy
intelligence, please.

58:37.022 --> 58:38.788
Oni, yeah.

58:38.856 --> 58:41.125
Lock 23? Lock 23, okay.

58:41.192 --> 58:42.859
23.

58:42.927 --> 58:45.996
46, okay,
nothing sighted.

58:46.064 --> 58:47.797
We still haven't spotted

58:47.865 --> 58:48.965
the pool where they've nested.

58:49.034 --> 58:50.634
We have the entire
irrigation system

58:50.668 --> 58:51.701
under patrol.

58:51.769 --> 58:52.903
The gatekeepers at each lock

58:52.970 --> 58:54.704
are on 24-hour guard.

58:54.772 --> 58:57.107
Someone is bound to spot
one of those creatures.

58:57.175 --> 58:58.875
When they do,
we close all the locks

58:58.943 --> 59:00.244
and hold it till we arrive.

59:00.311 --> 59:01.945
Then we'll follow
it back to the pool.

59:02.013 --> 59:03.680
Sounds like an effective plan.

59:03.748 --> 59:05.249
I'll be in capt.
Master's office.

59:05.316 --> 59:06.183
All right.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.717
How many patrols
have checked in?

59:07.785 --> 59:08.885
16.

59:08.953 --> 59:11.388
The gatekeepers
have called, except 3.

59:11.456 --> 59:12.356
See if you can get them.

59:12.424 --> 59:13.323
Right.

59:13.391 --> 59:16.826
Sally, try locks 14, 32 and 57.

59:16.894 --> 59:20.714
I'll call you back later, mom.

59:29.424 --> 59:31.925
Lock 57.

59:31.993 --> 59:35.563
Yes, I did try,
but the line was tied up.

59:35.630 --> 59:38.832
No, I haven't seen any creature.

59:38.900 --> 59:41.420
Just plain foolishness.

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.190
Hey, boys!

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.859
Get away from there!

01:00:38.893 --> 01:00:40.227
We don't allow no swimming here,

01:00:40.295 --> 01:00:41.428
you know that.

01:00:41.496 --> 01:00:42.829
Go on, now.

01:00:42.897 --> 01:00:44.177
Okay.

01:00:54.225 --> 01:00:56.493
Don't go in there, Sandy.

01:00:56.561 --> 01:00:58.128
We're going home now.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:00.397
When can we go swimming again?

01:01:00.465 --> 01:01:02.032
I don't know, dear.

01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:04.301
Then can I go look
at the rabbits?

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:05.669
Not today, sweetie.

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:12.442
Dr. Rogers' office.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:13.544
Yes, just a minute,

01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:18.848
I'll read you
the figures on that.

01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:22.219
That was 2-3-4-5.

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:26.356
Yes, and 5-4-2-3.

01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:29.125
Hello, grace. How are you today?

01:01:29.194 --> 01:01:31.895
We have to be very quiet,

01:01:31.962 --> 01:01:35.865
because mommy is so busy.

01:01:35.933 --> 01:01:39.169
Poor grace. You're cold.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:42.072
If I had a nice warm blanket,

01:01:42.139 --> 01:01:43.640
I'd put it over you.

01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:52.482
Maybe I can
figure something out.

01:02:24.148 --> 01:02:26.984
There. Is that better?

01:02:27.051 --> 01:02:30.487
I gotta go now. Goodbye.

01:02:30.554 --> 01:02:35.759
Fine. Goodbye.

01:02:35.827 --> 01:02:36.693
Sandy?

01:02:36.761 --> 01:02:37.828
Yes, mommy.

01:02:37.895 --> 01:02:39.496
Let's go home.

01:02:55.412 --> 01:02:56.880
Lock 41, okay.

01:02:56.948 --> 01:02:58.949
41, okay.

01:02:59.017 --> 01:03:02.519
Proceed eastward on highway 8-0.

01:03:02.586 --> 01:03:03.854
<i>Have you heard anything?</i>

01:03:03.921 --> 01:03:06.123
Not yet. We'll keep you posted.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:07.691
What time were
the boy and girl attacked

01:03:07.759 --> 01:03:08.992
last night?

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.426
9:30 or 10:00.

01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:11.862
It's 9:00 now.

01:03:11.929 --> 01:03:18.201
Yeah, I know.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.176
Mm-hmm.

01:03:49.366 --> 01:03:52.936
Hey, you kids!

01:03:53.004 --> 01:03:57.224
Don't try to hide from me.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:01.962
Hey, you kids!

01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:05.749
Hey, you kids!

01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:24.177
Still no answer.

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:25.445
When did you last talk to him?

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.713
At 8:00.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.215
Do we have a car in that area?

01:05:28.282 --> 01:05:29.949
There's one within half a mile.

01:05:30.018 --> 01:05:32.252
You better call it.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.920
Get moar and Walker in car 14.

01:05:33.988 --> 01:05:35.288
Right.

01:05:35.356 --> 01:05:39.259
This is control operations
calling car 14.

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:41.628
This is Walker, car 14.
What've you got?

01:05:41.696 --> 01:05:43.130
<i>Proceed to</i>

01:05:43.197 --> 01:05:44.665
<i>canal junction 57.</i>

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:48.401
<i>Repeat. Proceed to
canal junction 5-7.</i>

01:05:48.469 --> 01:05:49.703
Right.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.929
My god. I'll call in.

01:06:21.468 --> 01:06:22.769
This is car 14 calling

01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:24.888
control operations. Over.

01:06:24.956 --> 01:06:26.456
Come in, car 14.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:27.791
<i>Tell Josh we found</i>

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:29.125
<i>the gatekeeper dead,</i>

01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:30.427
<i>just like the others.</i>

01:06:30.495 --> 01:06:31.662
Have them stay there.

01:06:31.729 --> 01:06:32.663
Radio all the patrols.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:33.764
Roger.

01:06:33.831 --> 01:06:35.465
Close everything
that leads to lock 57.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.367
We'll try to hold it
long enough to follow it.

01:06:37.435 --> 01:06:40.170
Right. Sally, give me a line.

01:06:40.237 --> 01:06:42.872
Commander!

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.510
Could I help you?

01:06:46.577 --> 01:06:49.479
I'm here to see
cmdr. Twillinger.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.580
Will he be back?

01:06:50.648 --> 01:06:53.082
Not for some time.
You just missed him.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:56.787
I know. Well.

01:06:56.854 --> 01:06:58.888
Is there anything I could do?

01:06:58.956 --> 01:07:00.724
No.

01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:04.160
I think maybe I better wait.
If it's all right?

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:05.862
He may be gone for hours, Mr...

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.932
Dobbs. Lewis Clark dobbs.

01:07:08.999 --> 01:07:10.266
Mr. dobbs.

01:07:10.335 --> 01:07:11.435
Well.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:18.709
I'll wait.

01:07:18.776 --> 01:07:20.477
That's right.
Close the locks south

01:07:20.545 --> 01:07:22.646
from juncture 302 to 23.

01:07:22.714 --> 01:07:25.649
Right. And keep them closed
till you hear from me.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.933
I called in the minute
i heard that noise.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.367
I thought to myself,

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:19.868
"something's breaking out there."

01:08:19.937 --> 01:08:22.004
"There's sure
something breaking."

01:08:22.072 --> 01:08:24.908
So I come out
to see what it was.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.042
And there it was.

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:27.310
Why weren't you out here?

01:08:27.377 --> 01:08:28.745
The lock has
an emergency release.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.212
You could've stopped it.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.348
Listen, commander,

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:34.651
I was only doing
what they told me.

01:08:34.718 --> 01:08:36.352
I didn't know
you wanted to follow it.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420
You didn't?

01:08:37.455 --> 01:08:39.388
Thanks, anyway.

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:40.622
I know how you feel,

01:08:40.691 --> 01:08:42.325
but it wasn't his fault.

01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:43.460
Twill?

01:08:43.527 --> 01:08:44.461
Yeah?

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:45.828
What do we do now?

01:08:45.895 --> 01:08:47.063
Wait for another one.

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.529
Come on, let's go back.

01:08:53.636 --> 01:08:55.272
Commander.

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:56.939
Lewis Clark dobbs.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:58.640
Hello, Mr. dobbs. What is it?

01:08:58.709 --> 01:09:01.644
It's probably not
anything at all.

01:09:01.712 --> 01:09:03.446
I see.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:04.580
How's it coming, sailor?

01:09:04.648 --> 01:09:05.682
The same, sir.

01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:06.515
Nothing?

01:09:06.582 --> 01:09:07.582
No, sir.

01:09:07.618 --> 01:09:09.252
You said it was important,

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:10.854
you know, about the map.

01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:12.689
Yeah?

01:09:12.756 --> 01:09:15.192
A very strange thing happened.

01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:17.493
I was looking for these papers.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.996
Actually, I was looking

01:09:20.064 --> 01:09:21.832
for this petition.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.499
We're campaigning again

01:09:23.567 --> 01:09:25.202
for proposition 14-a,

01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:27.170
the one that was defeated,

01:09:27.238 --> 01:09:29.439
and there was this folder.

01:09:29.506 --> 01:09:30.807
And in the folder,

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.542
there was this map.

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:33.849
I remembered it

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.245
because Mrs. de fauna de porto

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:38.348
had asked me to take care of it,

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:40.283
and then she passed on.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.319
I told you about it, didn't I?

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.154
A very great loss.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.756
You see, the de
fauna de porto family

01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:47.991
settled this valley.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.327
A most distinguished family.

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:51.828
Is this a river?

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:55.131
No. But the Indians
dug Wells along there,

01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:56.499
apparently.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.807
Here. It says here,

01:09:58.836 --> 01:10:00.636
in Spanish, of course,

01:10:00.704 --> 01:10:03.773
"the Wells of life."

01:10:03.841 --> 01:10:07.077
I read 18 foreign languages.

01:10:07.144 --> 01:10:07.827
Clem!

01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:08.795
Sir?

01:10:08.863 --> 01:10:09.729
Any boys working
in the photo lab?

01:10:09.797 --> 01:10:10.630
Not now.

01:10:10.697 --> 01:10:11.898
Get them down there right now.

01:10:11.966 --> 01:10:13.967
I want this blown up
and graphed.

01:10:14.034 --> 01:10:15.368
Order me a helicopter at dawn

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:16.535
and notify Dr. Rogers.

01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:17.683
Right.

01:10:39.226 --> 01:10:41.546
Drop us down a little.

01:10:47.885 --> 01:10:49.519
That's the one.

01:10:49.587 --> 01:10:51.788
How do you want to proceed?

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:53.122
We radio for equipment,

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.858
then dive and destroy them.

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.405
Chances are they're dormant now,

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.839
but any sound may attract them.

01:11:09.907 --> 01:11:11.408
So set your charges and get out.

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:12.642
Right.

01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:13.509
Are you ready?

01:11:13.577 --> 01:11:14.377
Are you?

01:11:14.445 --> 01:11:15.478
I think so.

01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:18.714
Doctor, your lab's
on the mobile phone.

01:11:18.782 --> 01:11:20.650
Thank you. Yes, Gail.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.002
I sent you those
cylinders you asked for.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.438
They should be
there in 10 minutes.

01:11:25.506 --> 01:11:27.273
Thank you. We may need them.

01:11:27.341 --> 01:11:30.343
Hold on a minute.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.410
Gail?

01:11:31.478 --> 01:11:32.846
Yes, twill.

01:11:32.913 --> 01:11:34.233
<i>Hi!</i>

01:11:34.281 --> 01:11:35.614
Is everything all right?

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:37.616
Are you all right?

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:38.768
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.303
I'll call you later.

01:11:40.371 --> 01:11:42.372
<i>Okay. Twill?</i>

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.773
Yeah?

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.775
Take care.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.778
I always do.

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:50.046
Goodbye.

01:12:14.905 --> 01:12:16.406
I'll take it.

01:12:33.907 --> 01:12:35.808
I have you on the frequency.

01:12:35.876 --> 01:12:36.709
<i>We're moving through</i>

01:12:36.777 --> 01:12:38.110
<i>a dense growth.</i>

01:12:38.178 --> 01:12:40.313
<i>Can't tell
what's ahead from here.</i>

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:25.842
<i>We've reached the bottom.</i>

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:28.544
<i>We've found them.</i>

01:13:28.612 --> 01:13:30.346
Any problems?

01:13:30.414 --> 01:13:31.414
<i>No,</i>

01:13:31.481 --> 01:13:32.982
<i>I think we can get them all.</i>

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.584
It took you
3 minutes to get down.

01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:36.720
Allow yourselves
2 minutes leeway.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.427
<i>Will do.</i>

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.117
<i>We set the first charge.</i>

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:41.217
<i>The pin on my last charge</i>

01:14:41.285 --> 01:14:42.385
<i>is stuck.</i>

01:14:42.453 --> 01:14:44.653
Twill, Johns is in trouble.

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.667
You're 30 seconds
past safe time.

01:14:57.734 --> 01:14:59.068
Start up.

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:10.196
You're 42 seconds
past safe time.

01:15:10.263 --> 01:15:11.597
Start up.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:18.471
Are you on your way up?

01:15:18.539 --> 01:15:20.299
<i>Just a second.</i>

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:39.291
<i>We're on our way up.</i>

01:15:39.359 --> 01:15:44.981
You have 25 seconds.

01:15:45.048 --> 01:15:50.403
Come on.
Let's help pull them up.

01:15:50.471 --> 01:15:51.671
Hurry up.

01:16:17.714 --> 01:16:19.115
You fellows all right?

01:16:19.183 --> 01:16:20.183
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:26.789
I wanna make a check
in half an hour,

01:16:26.857 --> 01:16:28.491
when the sediment clears.

01:16:28.558 --> 01:16:29.893
All right.

01:16:45.659 --> 01:16:46.793
I'm sorry about

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:47.994
what happened down there.

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:49.128
You don't have to be.

01:16:49.196 --> 01:16:51.330
I made a mistake.
When I signaled you,

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.965
I was sure the pin was loose.

01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:54.801
Forget it, anyone's entitled

01:16:54.868 --> 01:16:55.968
to an honest mistake.

01:16:56.036 --> 01:16:57.904
Anyway, you saved my neck.

01:16:57.971 --> 01:16:59.438
Thanks.

01:16:59.506 --> 01:17:00.506
Excuse me,

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.308
I've got a phone call to make.

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.442
It's a great relief

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:04.610
knowing we got them all.

01:17:04.678 --> 01:17:06.279
Yeah.

01:17:06.346 --> 01:17:07.780
You know, I guess I was wrong

01:17:07.848 --> 01:17:09.481
about that guy.

01:17:09.549 --> 01:17:12.785
The commander takes
a bit of knowing.

01:17:12.853 --> 01:17:15.188
Mobile operator.
Give me Dr. Rogers' office.

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:22.094
The Navy lab, salton sea, 2-2-1.

01:17:22.162 --> 01:17:23.863
Johns is going to
stay to load up.

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:25.131
Would you mind
dropping me at the lab?

01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:29.468
Sure, jump in.

01:17:29.536 --> 01:17:31.570
I called Gail at the lab,
but the line was busy.

01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:33.873
Oh, really?

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.309
They're all down
at the pool, sir.

01:17:36.376 --> 01:17:40.813
Yes, I will.

01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:41.747
Hi, honey.

01:17:41.815 --> 01:17:43.449
Hi, mommy.

01:17:43.516 --> 01:17:45.151
I got dressed by myself.

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:46.752
And a good job you did, too.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.786
Have you had your orange juice?

01:17:47.855 --> 01:17:48.888
Yes.

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:50.489
We'll have breakfast
in a little while.

01:17:50.557 --> 01:17:51.590
Why don't you go play?

01:17:53.393 --> 01:17:55.661
Dr. Rogers' office.

01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:57.596
I'm sorry, he's not here now.

01:17:57.664 --> 01:18:00.900
I can take a message
if you wish.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:04.070
Yes, captain.
I'm sorry, he was called away.

01:18:20.354 --> 01:18:24.190
Grace?

01:18:26.693 --> 01:18:28.427
Ah!

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.829
Mommy!

01:18:30.898 --> 01:18:33.866
Sandy!

01:18:33.934 --> 01:18:35.801
Honey, stay where you are!

01:18:35.869 --> 01:18:37.536
Mommy!

01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:40.072
Mommy!

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.374
Don't move!

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.307
It's all right, honey.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:00.442
Someone will come
soon and help us.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.117
Mobile operator.

01:19:08.185 --> 01:19:09.585
Could you try
the Navy lab again?

01:19:09.653 --> 01:19:12.021
Salton sea, 2-2-1. That's right.

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:19.412
Still busy.

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:40.466
Want to stop and
get some breakfast?

01:19:40.534 --> 01:19:41.467
No, thanks.

01:19:41.535 --> 01:19:42.975
I had toast and coffee
when I got up.

01:19:43.002 --> 01:19:44.269
But if you want to stop...

01:19:44.338 --> 01:19:48.725
No, I can wait.

01:19:56.216 --> 01:19:57.216
Sandy.

01:19:57.284 --> 01:19:59.218
Do you see that window?

01:19:59.286 --> 01:20:00.853
Yes.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.022
Can you get up there?

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.858
Try!

01:20:05.925 --> 01:20:06.792
I can't.

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.861
Try!

01:20:08.928 --> 01:20:13.999
I can't!

01:20:14.067 --> 01:20:15.300
Oh, god.

01:20:21.808 --> 01:20:23.709
I want you to close your eyes.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:25.244
I want you to close your eyes

01:20:25.311 --> 01:20:29.047
and put your head right there.

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:31.675
Don't open them
for a little while.

01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:41.310
Good morning, commander. Doctor.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.779
Go ahead.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.719
Gail!

01:21:06.787 --> 01:21:08.237
Doctor!

01:21:08.305 --> 01:21:09.472
Get help!

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:10.700
Get help!

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.914
Can you hear me?

01:21:17.981 --> 01:21:18.981
Yes.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.314
Can you hear me?

01:21:51.381 --> 01:21:53.182
Yes.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:54.450
Now listen,

01:21:54.517 --> 01:21:56.485
when I holler come out of there.

01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:11.784
Now! All right. Now!

01:23:54.921 --> 01:23:57.122
Here, take it easy now.

01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:58.524
You're still shaken.

01:23:58.592 --> 01:24:01.527
Yes, I am. But i
feel all right now.

01:24:01.595 --> 01:24:03.095
What about you?

01:24:03.162 --> 01:24:04.697
I think I'm all right.

01:24:04.765 --> 01:24:06.732
You're just fine, honey.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.501
You know something?

01:24:08.568 --> 01:24:10.603
You can go swimming again.

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:11.771
Can I?

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:13.038
Yes, ma'am, you can.

01:24:14.305 --> 01:24:20.318
