WEBVTT

00:25.276 --> 00:29.189
- Dude, they'll find out.
- Not if we stick to the story.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.987
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.

00:32.074 --> 00:35.111
It's the only way.
We have to do this.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.360
They're still at it, huh?

00:37.455 --> 00:41.118
Look, we're running out of time.
We've gotta make a decision now.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.121
So are we all OK with this?

00:44.212 --> 00:47.204
This is a decision that
will affect the rest of our lives.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.254
I'm not taking it lightly.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.046
Kate?

00:53.137 --> 00:54.468
Yeah.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.637
Sun?

01:00.102 --> 01:02.093
- Frank?
- What?

01:02.188 --> 01:05.146
Sorry you got dragged in.
We need to know you're with us.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.940
Whatever you guys decide
I'll just roll with.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.106
Hurley, what about you?

01:12.490 --> 01:15.197
I don't think we should lie, dude.

01:15.284 --> 01:18.697
We need to protect the people
that we left behind, Hurley.

01:18.788 --> 01:20.699
How does lying protect them?

01:20.790 --> 01:24.954
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired people to kill us.

01:25.044 --> 01:29.708
He faked a plane crash. Telling him
the truth, he's gonna leave them alone?

01:31.634 --> 01:35.593
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like, call him off?

01:35.680 --> 01:38.262
There's no calling my father off.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.011
He'll never find them.
The island disappeared.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.093
We all saw it, it's gone.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.058
You think anyone's gonna
believe that? Believe any of it?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.143
They're gonna think you're crazy.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.937
Not if someone backs me up.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.784
Sayid, come on.

02:00.871 --> 02:04.159
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell
the truth, but what if we all do?

02:04.250 --> 02:07.413
If we can stick together,
we can make them believe us.

02:08.671 --> 02:11.037
I don't want to spend my life lying.
Do you?

02:11.132 --> 02:12.417
No.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.714
But...

02:14.468 --> 02:16.675
I don't believe we have a better choice.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.220
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.724
You know what, dude?

02:28.858 --> 02:30.564
I'm gonna remember this.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.820
And someday you're gonna need my help
and I'm telling you right now...

02:37.742 --> 02:39.232
...you're not getting it.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.163
Wake up, Sayid!

02:53.257 --> 02:55.293
Sayid!

02:55.384 --> 02:57.124
Sayid, wake up!

02:57.803 --> 02:58.838
Sayid!

03:19.784 --> 03:21.991
No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?

03:23.788 --> 03:25.744
What am I supposed to do?!

03:38.135 --> 03:39.750
OK, OK, OK.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.346
Just stay calm.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.763
What the hell were you thinking?

03:51.816 --> 03:54.353
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.979
Now why'd you pull over?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.690
| just...

03:58.781 --> 04:00.988
- I thought...
- You didn't think.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.690
What if I were real?

04:02.785 --> 04:05.276
What if a real cop stopped you?

04:05.371 --> 04:08.989
They have pictures of you covered
in blood with a gun in your hand.

04:09.083 --> 04:14.248
Actually, it's ketchup.
We went through a drive-through, and...

04:14.338 --> 04:18.377
Bro, you need to pull it together.
You've got a lot of work to do.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.922
- I do?
- Let's start with the basics.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.843
First off, you need new clothes.

04:24.515 --> 04:28.758
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.595
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.180
Then get to it.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.856
And stay away from the cops.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.023
Do not get arrested.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.152
Thanks, Ana Lucia.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.654
Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.259
Well... you heard her.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.502
You really think
that thing's gonna work?

05:38.589 --> 05:42.753
Of course it's gonna work. It's better
than rubbing two sticks together.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.335
- That's what you're supposed to do.
- This will work better.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.547
You've got too much wood inside,
gonna smother the leaves.

05:49.642 --> 05:52.679
If you don't have enough wood,
the leaves burn out.

05:52.770 --> 05:56.729
Fire? Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.272
- Who knows what'll happen this time?
- Neil,

05:59.360 --> 06:03.899
we are trying to focus on what
we can control. Help or be quiet.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.659
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.113
- Can I have it?
- What does it matter?

06:10.204 --> 06:13.992
- We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
- I'll take that as a yes, Frogurt.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.789
- lt's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.290
- Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.717
I figured it would
disappear with our stuff.

06:26.804 --> 06:30.547
I guess whatever we had with us
when we moved is along for the ride.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.597
- What?
- Look who's back.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.068
- Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
- I think it's Mr. Wizard.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.491
Shut up. You've been gone for two hours.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.412
- What the hell were you doing?
- You're right. Sorry.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.581
I left my pack in the jungle,
and l was coming back...

06:58.544 --> 07:01.581
It was a while before
I realized that l was really lost.

07:01.672 --> 07:05.005
Well, you figure out when the sky's
gonna light up again?

07:05.676 --> 07:07.507
- I don't know.
- You got a plan?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.759
No. We can'tjust sail out
on any course.

07:12.850 --> 07:17.469
For us to leave, I need
to calculate a new bearing.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.144
And to do that...

07:20.357 --> 07:22.643
...I need to determine
where we are now...

07:25.237 --> 07:26.613
...in time.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.939
What are the rest of us supposed to do?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.695
I'll go find something to eat.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.569
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Don't worry about it.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.870
I guess we'll get the water.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.827
Dude, wake up.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.912
I can't do this on my own.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.210
I promise I'll pay you back.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.974
Wait right here.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.827
- Shih tzus?
- I like shih tzus.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.413
It looks like you "heart" them.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.795
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.380
- Your friend's pretty wasted.
- Yeah.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.390
I know you from somewhere, don't I?

08:41.522 --> 08:42.887
No.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.018
I think I do. Yeah,
you definitely look familiar.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.852
- | just have one of those faces?
- You're lying.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.698
I don't believe in lying.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.779
I remember!

08:58.789 --> 09:00.950
You're the guy who won the lottery.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.703
And you crashed in that plane.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.910
No, I must look like him.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.087
You're him. Buy a ticket here.
You win, we get a commission.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.507
- You're good luck.
- Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.474
OK.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.312
OK, we're out of here.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.547
Mommy, I wanna go home.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.009
Look at your book, baby.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.629
Hello?

10:41.058 --> 10:43.049
I can't believe it's you.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.848
No. Hi, how are you?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.228
Wait. You're in LA?

10:54.530 --> 10:56.987
Of course I can meet. Where...

10:57.074 --> 11:00.362
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in a half an hour.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.363
Mommy, where are we going?

11:03.413 --> 11:04.994
To see a friend.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.619
Looking for your pills, Jack?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.417
l flushed them down the toilet.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.090
Thank you. l was just
going to do that myself.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.300
Yeah, I figured you were.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.638
- Going somewhere?
- I'm checking out.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.727
Where are we going?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.896
You're going home

12:12.983 --> 12:14.894
and find yourself a suitcase.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.648
lfthere's anything in this life
you want, pack it in there...

12:20.282 --> 12:22.489
...because you're never coming back.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.493
Good.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.038
Good.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.462
- I'll pick you up in six hours.
- And where will you be going?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.882
John's casket is outside
in a carpet van.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.675
I need to move it somewhere safe.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.096
Safe?

12:48.644 --> 12:50.350
He's dead, isn't he?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.562
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.181
Previously on Expose:

13:29.393 --> 13:32.510
Looks like the Scorpion is taking over
all the Cobra '8 business.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.812
You want me to work with Tsunami,
the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?

13:35.899 --> 13:38.356
- Yeah.
- I'm here to capture the Scorpion,

13:38.443 --> 13:41.935
so if you got a problem with that,
you can go work stage three.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.609
She's hit!

13:44.700 --> 13:47.316
Someone call an ambulance...

14:02.259 --> 14:03.795
Hey, Dad.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.335
How's it going?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.683
- Have you seen the news?
- No, ljust got up.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.262
- You on it again?
- Yeah. Kind of.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.439
- ls Mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.936
Set him over here.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.192
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he breathing?

14:26.283 --> 14:28.365
Barely. What happened?

14:28.452 --> 14:31.865
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart? Where were you, the zoo?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.571
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.702
Sayid took me there. To protect me.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.877
These two guys jumped out and shot him
with darts, and now he's in a coma.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.959
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger, we both are.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.840
Danger from who?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.510
I'm not sure, exactly.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.556
- Hello?
- Mr. Reyes?

15:00.650 --> 15:03.483
LAPD. Could you open the gate, please?

15:04.404 --> 15:08.363
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Don't tell them I'm here.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.158
All right. But you're gonna
tell me the truth.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.091
- You killed three people?
- No.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.927
- Sayid did.
- Oh, well, that's better.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.182
- Let's get him to the couch.
- He saved me.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.310
- I think we should call a lawyer now.
- No, no, no.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.938
We can't go public. They're after us.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.521
- Who? Who is after you?
- I don't know.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.279
- Sayid knows. He can explain.
- Sayid ain't explaining nothing.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.531
We need to get him to a hospital.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.034
Did you hear me?
People are trying to kill us!

15:58.125 --> 16:00.958
If we go there, they'll find us.
Like The Godfather.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.535
It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.964
They smother you with pillows and
make it look like an accident. Wake up!

16:08.051 --> 16:10.542
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.712
I think I know what to do.

16:21.148 --> 16:25.892
- Mommy, can I push the button?
- Sure, you can, sweetie.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.480
We're going all the way to the top, OK?
I want you to press number 31. See it?

16:30.574 --> 16:33.532
You see it? OK, 31.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.483
Yeah!

16:35.579 --> 16:39.071
You pressed it. You pressed it.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.099
Hi.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.273
Hello, Kate.

17:19.623 --> 17:22.285
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.918
Hello, Ben.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.967
If it's the porterhouse
you're looking for, we're out.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.890
No, no porterhouse.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.969
I do, however, have something
important in my van, Jill.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.897
- I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?

17:46.983 --> 17:48.268
It is.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.731
He'll be safe with me.

17:51.821 --> 17:55.734
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in?
- Everything's moving on schedule.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.237
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.

17:58.328 --> 18:02.412
- Really? Did you bribe him with pills?
- Cut the man some slack.

18:02.499 --> 18:07.118
- He's been through a lot. We all have.
- Right. Of course.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.918
Sorry.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.674
So keep him safe, Jill.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.623
Because if you don't...

18:15.011 --> 18:18.469
...everything we're about to do
won't matter at all.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.860
You got it, you got it,
you got it, you got it!

18:40.704 --> 18:43.320
- Why did you do that?
- You're supposed to fan it.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.953
- You said you knew how to start a fire.
- You said you didn't care.

18:47.043 --> 18:51.377
- I care about surviving.
- You need to take a timeout, Neil.

18:53.717 --> 18:57.380
You'll get it, Bernard. You will.
Just... just try again.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.092
Hey.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.389
Hi. Give me one second.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.510
I got you something.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.514
- Found these in the jungle.
- Thank you.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.975
There was only two. I thought we could
both do with a bite to eat.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.901
Thank you very much.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.399
You all right?

19:20.493 --> 19:23.405
| just can't seem to shake
this bloody headache.

19:28.752 --> 19:32.745
- I'm sure it'll pass.
- lt's notjust that.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.205
It was the weirdest thing,
earlier I was...

19:36.217 --> 19:38.299
l was thinking about my mom,

19:38.386 --> 19:42.425
and... all ofa sudden I
couldn't remember her maiden name.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.473
- Isn't that odd?
- Don't worry about it.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.427
All of us have been
under a lot of stress.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.439
OK?

19:53.818 --> 19:55.319
Daniel...

19:56.363 --> 19:58.649
...do you know what's happening to me?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.449
Dinner!

20:08.625 --> 20:11.367
That's great!
Where did you get that?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.577
I found it.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.627
What do you mean, you found it?

20:16.591 --> 20:18.877
lt died in thejungle. I found it.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.094
Don't worry, it's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.344
- What?
- Who's got a knife?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.925
A knife? You need a knife?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.136
It's by the Cuisinart next to the stove.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.392
- What's your problem?
- My problem is...

20:33.483 --> 20:36.475
...we don't have a knife.
We don't have anything.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.982
It wouldn't matter if we did
'cause the dentist can't start a fire.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.406
- Ease up there, Frogurt.
- lt's Neil, you inbred!

20:43.493 --> 20:46.451
And I'm not gonna ease up,
'cause I'm tired,

20:46.538 --> 20:49.575
- hungry and screwed! We're all screwed!
- Calm down.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.078
- We're gonna get through this.
- How?!

20:52.168 --> 20:55.535
Didn't you hear what I just said!?
We can't even get fire!

21:01.386 --> 21:02.671
Run!

21:20.029 --> 21:22.190
Come on. Get up, get up!

21:36.129 --> 21:39.212
Come on, split up!
Everybody get to the creek!

21:44.471 --> 21:46.052
Dan!

21:47.223 --> 21:49.054
Keep moving!

22:06.201 --> 22:09.409
Come on, he's dead. Come on,
you wanna be dead too? Come on!

22:12.040 --> 22:14.873
There's nothing you could have done.
We got to go now!

22:21.174 --> 22:25.167
- Dude, they're on a stakeout?
- You escaped from a mental institution.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.469
There are dead bodies!
Of course they're on a stakeout.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.842
They think you're crazy enough
to come home.

22:34.729 --> 22:36.594
So are you...

22:37.774 --> 22:38.809
...crazy?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.603
Do you think I am?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.573
Either that or you're lying to me.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.739
Well, I'm not crazy.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.792
And l have a really good reason
why I'm lying to you.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.587
What is it?

23:07.095 --> 23:10.633
Why is there a dead Pakistani
on my couch?

23:12.934 --> 23:14.390
He's not dead, Ma.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.217
Well, he's not breathing.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.722
He's not?!

23:20.858 --> 23:25.318
- It's OK, Carmen, we have a plan.
- A plan? What are you talking about?

23:25.572 --> 23:28.609
He is breathing. Kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now!

23:28.700 --> 23:30.565
- What is happening?
- Mom, please!

23:30.660 --> 23:34.198
No "Mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?

23:34.289 --> 23:36.075
Do you know what they are saying?

23:36.165 --> 23:39.293
Yeah, I know. Everything's gonna
make sense, I promise.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.662
lt better!

23:55.268 --> 23:56.974
Officers.

24:02.483 --> 24:03.859
So how long are you in LA?

24:05.028 --> 24:06.484
Just a few days.

24:06.571 --> 24:09.187
l have some business to attend to.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.522
But I wanted to see you.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.067
Here it is.

24:14.162 --> 24:17.700
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.043
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.622
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.375
I hope someday you get to meet her.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.173
It would be nice to see her
and Aaron play together.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.054
Yeah.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.922
Kate, are you all right?

24:36.768 --> 24:38.508
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.223
Are you?

24:52.575 --> 24:55.988
- Somebody knows we're lying.
- What?

24:56.079 --> 24:59.071
- Some lawyers came to see me.
- Who?

24:59.916 --> 25:03.829
Two men. They came to my house
and they asked for a blood sample.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.376
Some kind of lawsuit.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.499
They wanted to test to see if...

25:09.342 --> 25:11.253
To see if Aaron's my son.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.882
Who do these lawyers represent?

25:16.265 --> 25:19.223
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me
who their client is.

25:21.062 --> 25:24.099
Then they're not interested
in exposing the lie.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.600
- How do you know?
- lfthey were, they would just do it.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.651
They wouldn't come to you in private.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.195
They don't care we're lying.
They want Aaron.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.524
But who would do that?

25:36.619 --> 25:39.827
I don't know,
but you need to take care of them.

25:40.998 --> 25:43.250
What do you mean,
"take care of them"?

25:43.668 --> 25:47.502
Wouldn't you do anything you had to
in order to keep Aaron?

25:51.008 --> 25:53.966
What kind of a person
do you think I am?

26:04.313 --> 26:07.555
The kind of person who makes
hard decisions when she has to.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.519
Like you did on the freighter.

26:18.035 --> 26:22.495
You told me to get on the helicopter,
and you said you'd get Jin.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.665
Sun, I hope you don't think...

26:26.753 --> 26:28.368
You did what you had to do.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.465
And if you hadn't...

26:33.259 --> 26:37.047
...we probably all would have died,
instead ofjust my husband.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.847
I'm sorry...

26:47.148 --> 26:48.979
I'm so sorry.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.609
I don't blame you.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.537
So... how's Jack?

27:09.629 --> 27:12.746
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.502
But he swore I could. So... can I?

27:16.719 --> 27:18.880
- Yes. Of course.
- All right.

27:26.771 --> 27:30.480
- What happened to him?
- Hugo said he got hit with some dart.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.308
- Must've been some drugs.
- And where is Hurley?

27:33.402 --> 27:35.393
At our house, freaking out.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.945
I'm gonna get my car,
help me move him over.

27:38.032 --> 27:40.569
- l have to get him to the hospital.
- No.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.946
Hugo said whoever did this
will come back.

27:43.037 --> 27:46.780
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, you brought
him to me. I'm gonna do what's best.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.705
Fine. Take him to the hospital.

27:48.793 --> 27:51.500
All due respect, Dr. Shephard,
when this is over,

27:51.587 --> 27:54.203
- you're gonna do something for me.
- What?

27:54.298 --> 27:56.380
Stay away from Hugo.

27:56.467 --> 28:01.211
Whatever you talked him into, you don't
have his best interests at heart.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.387
So stay away from my son.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.351
Hello.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.189
Ben... you'll never guess
who just showed up at my door.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.449
- Who?
- Sayid.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.460
Who is Sayid?

28:42.555 --> 28:44.637
I thought he was your friend.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.506
He is my friend.

28:46.601 --> 28:50.844
But he's also got this double life where
he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.

28:51.814 --> 28:55.398
- But he's a good guy.
- A good guy doesn't kill three men.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.396
- A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom...

28:58.487 --> 29:00.819
Don't "Mom" me.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.364
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.

29:03.451 --> 29:06.113
The news thinks you did this.

29:06.203 --> 29:09.491
And if the news does, everyone does.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.455
Why is this happening?

29:12.543 --> 29:15.034
How can anybody want to hurt you?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.416
I don't know.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.508
Tell your mother the truth.

29:36.192 --> 29:37.898
We lied, Ma.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.067
- What do you mean, you lied?
- All of us.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.571
The Oceanic Six. We lied about
what happened after the crash.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.030
And what did happen?

29:59.548 --> 30:01.709
OK.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.632
See, we did crash.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.589
But it was on this crazy island.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.548
And we waited for rescue,
and there wasn't any rescue.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.634
There was a smoke monster
and other people on the island.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.264
We called them "the Others."

30:14.355 --> 30:16.846
They started attacking us.

30:16.941 --> 30:21.105
And we found hatches. There was a button
you had to push every 108 minutes or...

30:22.613 --> 30:24.695
Well, l was never really clear on that.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.819
The Others didn't have
anything to do with the hatches.

30:27.910 --> 30:31.494
That was the Dharma lnitiative.
But the Others killed them.

30:31.580 --> 30:35.289
Now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others

30:35.376 --> 30:37.207
because worse people were coming.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.127
Desmond's girlfriend's father
sent them to kill us.

30:40.214 --> 30:44.002
We stole their helicopter,
flew to their freighter, but it blew up.

30:44.093 --> 30:46.709
We couldn't go to the island.
It disappeared.

30:46.804 --> 30:51.264
So we crashed in the ocean, and floated
a while until a boat picked us up.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.592
By then there were six of us.
That part was true.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.940
But the re...

31:09.660 --> 31:11.321
But the rest of the people...

31:14.040 --> 31:15.655
...who were on the plane...

31:19.003 --> 31:20.914
They're still on that island.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.555
I believe you.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.567
I don't understand you,

31:45.654 --> 31:47.360
but I believe you.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.909
A lot of people died, Ma.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.825
Now this bad stuff
is happening because...

32:02.213 --> 32:03.669
Well...

32:08.219 --> 32:10.050
We shouldn't have lied.

32:20.648 --> 32:22.184
You OK?

32:22.274 --> 32:24.765
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just stepped on something.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.896
Something jammed...

32:32.576 --> 32:34.407
Son of a bitch.

32:35.830 --> 32:39.038
Keep moving, we gotta hook up
with everybody at the creek.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.116
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?

32:41.210 --> 32:44.168
The wet part. Sorry if my plan's
not up to Other...

33:19.623 --> 33:22.080
Who were those people? Were they yours?

33:22.168 --> 33:25.331
- Did they shoot the arrows?
- Want me to crawl out and ask?

33:25.421 --> 33:28.538
You don't have to be a wise-ass.
l'mjust trying to...

33:38.934 --> 33:40.765
What are you doing on our island?

33:45.316 --> 33:48.353
Respiratory therapist to ICU.

33:48.444 --> 33:49.934
Respiratory therapist...

34:01.749 --> 34:06.413
Transport to Radiology.
Transport to Radiology.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.897
Come on.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.233
Son of a bitch.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.905
Come on, Sayid.

34:37.785 --> 34:39.150
Come on.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.824
Sayid! Sayid!

34:45.167 --> 34:47.453
It's me. It's Jack.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.045
It's OK. It's all right.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.384
You're OK. You're all right.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.936
What happened?

35:08.023 --> 35:11.481
You're fine. You're in the hospital.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.318
Hurley's father brought you to me.

35:15.406 --> 35:16.737
Hurley's father?

35:19.660 --> 35:22.117
He said you'd been attacked.

35:22.913 --> 35:26.280
- Where's Hurley?
- He's at his parents' house.

35:26.375 --> 35:30.539
- Who's with him?
- I don't know. His mother, maybe?

35:31.547 --> 35:33.458
Does anyone else know he's there?

35:46.228 --> 35:47.809
Hello, Hugo.

35:50.899 --> 35:53.151
Get away from me! Get away!

35:53.235 --> 35:55.521
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.

35:56.405 --> 36:00.023
And I can assure you,
I've taken care of everything.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.529
l have a car waiting for us out back.

36:02.619 --> 36:05.406
The police didn't see me.
I can get you out of here.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.453
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.830
I'm taking you to Sayid.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.879
He's with Jack. That's why I'm here.
Jack called me.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.675
How else would I know
that they're together?

36:23.766 --> 36:27.475
No! You're playing
one of your mind games.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.517
They would never trust you.

36:29.605 --> 36:33.518
In their defense,
I'm not an easy person to trust.

36:33.609 --> 36:38.444
But they came around when they realized
that we all want the same thing.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.450
And what's that?

36:43.869 --> 36:45.780
To go back to the island.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.999
Come with us, Hugo.

36:53.087 --> 36:55.328
And this will be over.
You can stop hiding.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.459
You can stop worrying about
the stories and deceptions.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.502
If you come with me...

37:02.596 --> 37:05.053
...you won't ever have to lie again.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.022
Please...

37:19.488 --> 37:20.477
Let me help you.

37:33.627 --> 37:34.912
Never, dude.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.624
You got me! That's right, you got me!

37:41.718 --> 37:44.846
- That's right, I'm the killer!
- Stop! Police!

37:44.930 --> 37:47.672
I'm crazy! I'm a murderer!
I killed four people!

37:47.766 --> 37:51.850
Three people... However many are
dead, I killed them! I killed them all.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.644
Just get me away from here!

37:55.190 --> 37:58.682
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used

37:58.777 --> 38:01.894
against you in a court of law. You have
the right to speak to an attorney...

38:01.989 --> 38:03.229
Just get me out of here.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.990
If you can't afford a lawyer,
one will be provided for you.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.995
I'm gonna make this simple.

38:16.086 --> 38:19.954
Tell me what you're doing, how many
of you there are and how you got here.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.585
- Let her go.
- Unless you're answering questions,

38:22.676 --> 38:24.632
don't speak.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.676
Tell me, or I cut off her other hand.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.503
- What?
- Other?

38:28.599 --> 38:33.684
The first one isn't negotiable, it's
just to illustrate how serious I am.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.261
Hold on. Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.348
- The island, there are these flashes...
- Do it.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.308
I'll tell you what you want to know!

38:41.403 --> 38:43.359
- Do it!
- No!

39:14.269 --> 39:16.646
James. Juliet.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.233
Nice to see you.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.480
- Any luck?
- Yes.

40:49.031 --> 40:51.238
- Really?
- Really.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.867
- What about you?
- I'm having some difficulties.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.615
Well, you'd better get busy

40:57.706 --> 40:59.571
'cause you only have 70 hours.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.622
That's not enough! I need at least...

41:01.710 --> 41:03.951
What you need is irrelevant.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.379
Seventy hours is what you've got.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.212
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.048
What happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

41:20.937 --> 41:22.973
Then God help us all.
