WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.671
<i>Previously on iZombie.</i>

00:02.879 --> 00:04.381
Once
the Super Max
enters the blood stream...

00:04.589 --> 00:07.050
We can crank
the treadmill up as high
as ten miles per hour.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.969
Endurance and strength
also sky rocket.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.887
<i>- Who's Rita?</i>
<i>- She was meaningless.</i>

00:11.096 --> 00:13.431
He said
this desperate Rita chick
threw herself at him.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.809
Night, Rita.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.603
You're a sick bitch
and I just want you out now.

00:18.812 --> 00:20.313
<i>New Hope
died this afternoon.</i>

00:20.522 --> 00:21.690
<i>- So Major.</i>
<i>- And Blaine.</i>

00:21.898 --> 00:23.316
They're on borrowed time now.

00:23.525 --> 00:25.527
Blaine is selling Utopium.
He's taking on Mr. Boss.

00:25.735 --> 00:26.861
Where to, boss?

00:27.070 --> 00:27.988
Boss' guys figured out
there's a rat.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.280
<i>You're gonna get me killed.</i>

00:29.489 --> 00:30.407
Any last words?

00:43.795 --> 00:45.880
I am hungry like the wolf.

00:47.382 --> 00:48.550
Sorry?

00:48.758 --> 00:50.802
The music.
<i>Hungry Like the Wolf.</i>

00:53.221 --> 00:54.931
I think that's <i>The Reflex.</i>

00:56.683 --> 00:57.934
So true.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.020
So true.

01:01.813 --> 01:04.274
I mean,
talk about crazy.
- Uh-huh.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.484
And Gilda used
a different name.

01:06.693 --> 01:08.319
- Rita.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08.528 --> 01:09.612
Ravi, are you even listening?

01:10.447 --> 01:12.490
Half listening.

01:12.699 --> 01:16.494
I confess imagining this poor
woman's final moments as she
burned alive

01:16.703 --> 01:17.912
is distracting me somewhat.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.831
But I get the basics.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.960
Um... Gilda-slash-Rita
slept with Major,

01:24.169 --> 01:26.337
you found out, confrontation,

01:26.546 --> 01:28.631
argue, argue, argue,
exit Gilda.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.467
And I punched her in the face.

01:30.675 --> 01:33.303
You Americans
and your violence.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.096
I'm not getting much evidence
off this mess.

01:35.305 --> 01:37.307
Make yourself useful.

01:53.531 --> 01:56.201
The landlord gave us an ID
on our arson victim.

01:56.409 --> 01:57.827
Dr. Eleanor Cash.

01:58.036 --> 02:01.081
I was calling her
"Cinder-ella".

02:02.540 --> 02:04.042
52, single,

02:04.250 --> 02:06.211
was on unemployment this last
year. You get anything?

02:06.419 --> 02:09.631
Uh, face was doused
with a flammable liquid,
set alight.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.216
Prolonged and painful.

02:11.424 --> 02:13.551
Not the way I'd choose to go.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.220
Whale ingestion,
if you're curious.

02:15.428 --> 02:17.639
Someone must've
really hated her.

02:17.847 --> 02:20.225
According to Google,
she was a scientist.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.227
A researcher for
Nescott Laboratories.

02:22.435 --> 02:24.479
They'd been hired to test
a new acne medication,

02:24.687 --> 02:28.191
and one of their test subjects
had a bad reaction.
Pain, facial scarring.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.151
Girl named Annie Rosine.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.196
She sued, there was a trial,
Dr. Cash was fired
in disgrace.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.489
Hasn't worked since.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.032
Test subject
with facial scarring.

02:36.241 --> 02:37.826
The victim had
her face burned.

02:38.034 --> 02:39.953
A not unreasonable
hypothesis is...

02:40.161 --> 02:41.246
They're connected?

02:41.454 --> 02:43.414
Yeah. I put that together.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.583
I'm off to talk to Annie
if you're feeling visiony.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.001
Okay.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.420
Enjoy.

02:49.629 --> 02:51.089
I'll just be here.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.424
Alone.

02:53.633 --> 02:56.177
Gazing unblinkingly
into the face of death

02:56.386 --> 02:58.721
that inevitably awaits us all.

02:59.305 --> 03:02.809
Brains.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.562
Bra...

03:05.770 --> 03:07.689
Kidding. Kind of.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.774
I do need brains. You got any?

03:11.151 --> 03:12.861
You've reverted
to zombie form?

03:13.069 --> 03:16.322
Well, if I haven't,
things have just gotten kinky.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.268
Sorry to drop in unannounced,

03:45.476 --> 03:48.104
but this guy on the bus,
he was so bald,

03:48.313 --> 03:50.356
I could almost see his brain.

03:50.565 --> 03:53.318
I had to take the edge off
before things got weird,
and you were closest.

03:53.526 --> 03:54.986
Deceased scientist.

03:55.195 --> 03:57.113
That's all
I've got at the moment.
Should keep you going.

03:57.322 --> 03:58.948
For now.

03:59.157 --> 04:00.450
That was an ominous pause.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.827
New Hope?

04:03.036 --> 04:05.330
Our test rat who reverted
back to a zombie?

04:05.538 --> 04:07.624
- She died.
- Too much to hope
for a rat suicide?

04:09.042 --> 04:11.294
It's the cure.

04:11.502 --> 04:14.214
Not only do its effects on
zombie-ism appear temporary,

04:14.422 --> 04:16.090
but the reversion
back to zombie state

04:16.299 --> 04:19.177
is followed by decline
and then death.

04:19.385 --> 04:22.847
So if you're in
reversion phase,

04:23.056 --> 04:25.516
the next phase most likely
isn't far behind.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.685
Kinda skimping on
the silver lining here, doc.

04:27.894 --> 04:29.771
The silver lining,
such as it is,

04:29.979 --> 04:31.940
we've found more
of the tainted Utopium.

04:32.148 --> 04:35.276
I'm working on a new cure.
I just injected a new subject,
so...

04:35.485 --> 04:37.362
Well, hopefully it works.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.280
'Cause it would be
a real shame if your
local brain supplier died

04:39.489 --> 04:41.491
and you ended up
with a horde of zombies
running around Seattle

04:41.699 --> 04:43.076
just as the Mariners
were set to contend.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.870
I agree.
I'm working accordingly.

04:46.079 --> 04:48.873
You know, you could
provide Liv and me a list
of your zombie clientele.

04:49.082 --> 04:51.042
Just in case.

04:51.251 --> 04:53.461
Oh. You were serious
about that?

04:53.628 --> 04:56.714
Well, in case you'd forgotten,
those hungry zombies provide
not only my livelihood

04:56.923 --> 04:59.634
but also the reason
no one decides to harm
dear old Blaine, so...

05:00.593 --> 05:02.136
Thank you for the brain.

05:05.265 --> 05:08.226
You wouldn't happen to have
any clothes I could borrow?

05:08.434 --> 05:11.354
Maybe something vaguely
redolent of punting on
the Thames?

05:13.398 --> 05:15.149
Will that be all?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.651
You mind calling me an Uber?

05:24.033 --> 05:26.744
Annie Rosine. Originally from
Red Deer, Alberta,

05:26.953 --> 05:28.621
enrolled at U of W,

05:28.830 --> 05:30.581
then as a senior
looking to make extra cash

05:30.790 --> 05:33.418
signed on as a test subject
in a drug trial.

05:33.626 --> 05:36.170
Then, one bad reaction
later... Whoa!

05:36.379 --> 05:39.090
Okay, I might murder
whoever did that to me.

05:39.299 --> 05:40.717
Just remember,
try not to stare.

05:45.013 --> 05:47.390
Hi. Can I help you?

05:48.766 --> 05:52.103
Hi. Clive Babineaux.
Seattle PD.

05:52.312 --> 05:53.730
- Annie Rosine?
- That's me.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.648
Freak! Freak!

05:55.857 --> 05:57.066
Uncool, you!

06:00.194 --> 06:01.446
Come on in.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.822
Tough neighborhood.

06:03.031 --> 06:04.449
Is it my hair?

06:04.657 --> 06:07.035
Wow. Somebody murdered
Dr. Cash.

06:07.243 --> 06:10.079
I don't even know
how I feel about that.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.123
Uh. I'm sorry for staring,

06:12.332 --> 06:15.084
just you weren't quite
what we expected.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.003
Thank God for plastic surgery.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.130
Must have been expensive.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.841
- Was there a settlement?
- I sued, but didn't get much
considering...

06:22.050 --> 06:24.052
What happened at the trial?

06:24.260 --> 06:25.720
Basically, it was Dr. Cash
and her partner trying to
blame each other.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.805
Her partner? Dr. Alan Benway?

06:28.014 --> 06:29.807
That sounds right.

06:30.016 --> 06:32.143
They both got fired,
the company hid behind
the release forms

06:32.352 --> 06:35.229
and I ended up with
a small settlement that
covered some of the surgery.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.524
And loans that I'll be
paying off the rest of my life
covered the rest.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.818
They ever figure out why
you were the only one
who got scarred?

06:41.027 --> 06:43.821
They say it was a reaction
to the anti-anxiety meds
I was taking.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.908
Look, I won't lie.
It was a nightmare.

06:47.075 --> 06:50.119
I looked grotesque, my face
felt like it was on fire,

06:50.328 --> 06:54.749
and, yeah,
I wished horrible deaths
on everyone involved.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.501
But thanks to
modern medicine,

06:56.709 --> 07:00.338
I lost my motive
to murder anyone.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.092
Anyway, I was
working the graveyard at
King Cannery that night.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.218
You can call and check.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.898
So, you want to see me?

07:19.107 --> 07:20.775
Mmm, mmm, hmm.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.652
One sec and...

07:23.778 --> 07:25.029
Boom.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.115
Just finished my keynote
for Rager-Con '16,

07:27.323 --> 07:28.783
and it's not even 10:00.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.868
Super Max, man. Super Max!

07:31.077 --> 07:34.497
I mean, my mental
energy is like, it's...

07:34.705 --> 07:36.207
It's off the charts.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.251
And physically? Forget it.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.294
Ask the Air Gaulle
flight attendant

07:40.461 --> 07:44.132
how many <i>petits morts</i>
she morted last night?
Go ahead.

07:44.340 --> 07:46.426
Sounds like
a personal question
for a total stranger.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.469
Six! You're welcome!

07:48.678 --> 07:50.513
Saved you the embarrassment.

07:50.721 --> 07:55.017
This is what boundless energy
looks like, Major. This!

07:55.226 --> 07:59.063
- Yeah, but it can
make you a little...
- What?

07:59.272 --> 08:02.400
- Aggressive.
- Aggressive is good.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.861
Now, we got some new
zombie names for you
to deal with.

08:05.069 --> 08:07.947
- More names?
- Well, we're constantly
monitoring hot sauce,

08:08.156 --> 08:10.908
hair dye and fake tan spending
in the Pacific Northwest.

08:11.117 --> 08:14.495
We would not want
any zombie-come-latelys
crashing our party.

08:14.704 --> 08:15.621
Would we?

08:15.830 --> 08:16.747
Rita's coming in with a list.

08:16.956 --> 08:18.916
Rita. About that.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.252
I just found out that
she's been Liv's roommate.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.172
Have I not been doing
a good job?

08:24.380 --> 08:26.549
Well, you know what?
Let's find out.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.304
Ask again later.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.183
I've been taking out zombies.

08:35.391 --> 08:37.727
I've passed all your
nutty little tests.

08:37.935 --> 08:41.230
Everything we had you do,
and it's a privacy issue which
gets your panties in a twist?

08:41.439 --> 08:44.150
I assumed the deal was
if I cooperated, you kept
Liv out of this.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.820
Yeah, well, when
you assume, you... Yep.

08:48.029 --> 08:50.281
There's always a method
to the madness, my boy.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.783
Was having Rita seduce me
part of the madness?

08:52.992 --> 08:55.411
Gaylord says what?

08:55.620 --> 08:58.206
- You didn't know?
- That you were my doing
the featherbed jig

08:58.414 --> 08:59.874
with my daughter?

09:00.666 --> 09:01.834
Mmm... No.

09:04.295 --> 09:05.796
- Your...
- Daughter!

09:06.005 --> 09:07.548
With the list.

09:07.757 --> 09:09.091
20 new names.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.636
So, sweet child of mine,

09:11.844 --> 09:14.931
who's always telling Daddy
not to sleep with the help.

09:16.641 --> 09:18.100
Really, Major?

09:18.309 --> 09:20.353
I didn't figure you
for the kiss-and-tell type.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.146
It came out
by accident.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.814
An accident, huh?

09:24.023 --> 09:25.650
Kinda like last night
was an accident?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.319
Rita.

09:29.529 --> 09:30.488
Sweetheart.

09:31.155 --> 09:32.365
Come here.

09:41.499 --> 09:42.792
You think this is funny?

09:45.294 --> 09:47.255
You think you can
hurt my daughter? Huh?

09:47.463 --> 09:49.131
- Whoa!
- Stop it!

09:49.340 --> 09:51.467
It was Liv, not him!
You've got the list.
You should go.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.177
You don't mess
with my daughter!

09:54.345 --> 09:56.264
Look at that.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.848
What do you think
that's worth, end of the day?
Half a million?

09:59.475 --> 10:03.062
A million? Whoa!

10:03.271 --> 10:06.190
All that money rolling in,
what're we getting?

10:06.399 --> 10:07.858
Bupkis is what we're getting.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.029
Bollocks.

10:12.238 --> 10:14.448
It is monkeys outside.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.534
I'm off to Bedfordshire.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.869
New look.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.204
Yes?

10:20.413 --> 10:22.123
No? No.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.375
Where you been?

10:24.584 --> 10:25.793
The shipment came in,
and we didn't know...

10:26.002 --> 10:28.129
Boys. The night I had.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.632
Mr. Boss nabs me,
slits my throat

10:31.841 --> 10:33.467
- and buries me in a hole.
- Wait, what?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.720
No need for concern. You see,
it seems I'm a zombie again,

10:35.928 --> 10:37.722
so, I bounced back.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.183
What should concern us though,
is our friend Drake.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.936
Part of the point of
having a guy inside
Mr. Boss' operation

10:44.145 --> 10:46.397
is getting a heads up when
something like this is coming.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.065
We didn't know anything.

10:48.274 --> 10:50.151
Yeah, if history is any guide,
I'm sure you're right.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.986
Silver lining though.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.362
Mr. Boss thinks I'm dead.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.407
Let's let him
keep thinking that.

10:56.616 --> 10:59.160
You remember that hole
we dug for Major?

11:00.244 --> 11:01.245
Yeah.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.247
I need you to take that

11:03.456 --> 11:04.915
and bury it there instead.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.168
We're gonna shut down for now.
Lay low.

11:07.335 --> 11:10.755
Okay, I should go change
before I start writing poems
about the moors.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.424
I imagine
my cheeks could use
a little color, as well.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.468
Ta.

11:17.762 --> 11:19.430
Okay,
so it's confirmed?

11:19.639 --> 11:21.390
Lighter fluid?

11:21.599 --> 11:23.643
Any idea of the brand?

11:23.851 --> 11:24.935
Well, there was
a can at the scene,

11:25.144 --> 11:26.062
but the label's burned off.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.150
What's up?

11:33.277 --> 11:35.363
Blaine's dad had a cabin
up in Whistler.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.531
Finally got the Canadians
to let us search it.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.241
Guess what we found
in the fridge?

11:39.450 --> 11:40.618
I don't know. A ham?

11:40.826 --> 11:42.870
Secret plans?
I'm not a guesser.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.541
- Brains.
- More brains?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.585
Like the brains
Mrs. Suzuki gave us?

11:49.794 --> 11:51.921
That we tested?
And that came back bovine?

11:52.129 --> 11:53.464
Not these.

11:53.673 --> 11:55.007
Too big for a cow.
Unless this cow's a genius.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.467
Cows are large.

11:56.676 --> 11:57.968
But their brains are smaller
than ours.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.720
You ever met a cow?
They're dumb.

11:59.929 --> 12:02.807
My buddy at the FBI lab
will sort this out.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.059
<i>Lab. This is Jason.</i>

12:05.267 --> 12:06.977
Jason! It's Dale.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.562
I need you to
settle something.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.607
Uh, a cow's brain.
We're talking, like, softball?

12:11.816 --> 12:13.818
<i>Baseball, at best.
If it's a cow.</i>

12:14.026 --> 12:15.820
Told you
they're not cow brains.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.279
<i>You guys find
more human brains?</i>

12:19.699 --> 12:21.075
What do you mean, more?

12:21.283 --> 12:22.993
<i>Didn't you read my report
on the last one?</i>

12:23.202 --> 12:24.370
<i>That was human, too.</i>

12:31.836 --> 12:33.587
So the brain
you tested before?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.715
That was a human brain?

12:35.923 --> 12:37.633
<i>Like I said in the report,
which I guess you didn't
even read.</i>

12:37.842 --> 12:39.677
We'll read this one.
We're sending you
a new sample.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.595
Thanks, Jason.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.681
Why did the report we read
say "bovine"?

12:43.889 --> 12:45.516
I don't know.

12:45.725 --> 12:47.184
Maybe someone changed it.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.353
But why? Who would do that?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.528
<i>Drake. Late again.</i>

12:57.737 --> 12:59.488
<i>What does it mean?</i>

12:59.697 --> 13:01.031
<i>Existing data points.</i>

13:01.240 --> 13:02.783
<i>Lateness, standing me up,</i>

13:02.992 --> 13:04.493
<i>leaving at odd hours
of the night</i>

13:04.702 --> 13:06.620
<i>suggest various hypotheses.</i>

13:06.829 --> 13:10.207
<i>He's just not that into me,
he's got a zombie on the side.</i>

13:10.416 --> 13:12.293
<i>Maybe I'm the zombie
on the side.</i>

13:12.460 --> 13:15.588
<i>What I need is additional data
and more detailed observation.</i>

13:20.176 --> 13:22.428
- Hey, Liv.
Sorry I'm late.
- Don't be.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.347
So, I know Netflix and chill
is supposed to be code,

13:25.556 --> 13:27.183
but there really is a movie
I wanted to see...

13:27.391 --> 13:29.810
Actually, I changed my mind.
I want to go out.

13:30.019 --> 13:33.022
- What's the name of the place
where you're a bouncer?
- Uh... The Snake Eye?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.149
That place is kind of rough.
Why would you want to
go there?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.942
Uh, call it
scientific curiosity.

13:39.737 --> 13:40.696
Hey, Drake.

13:42.948 --> 13:43.908
What's up, cuz?

13:46.494 --> 13:47.578
Hey, baby.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.333
Hey, man.

13:59.048 --> 14:00.424
<i>Initial observations.</i>

14:00.633 --> 14:03.219
<i>This is Drake in his
natural environment.</i>

14:05.387 --> 14:07.932
Cheap beer.
Top shelf vodka.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.767
- How...
- I've been doing this a while.

14:13.479 --> 14:15.481
Nice.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.775
So this must be that girl
we've been hearing all about?
She's real?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.944
Hey, can you tell Patrick
I can cover for him tomorrow?

14:20.152 --> 14:22.071
<i>So, Drake does have a job.</i>

14:22.279 --> 14:24.532
<i>He's on familiar terms
with a crusty bartender.</i>

14:24.740 --> 14:26.325
<i>He's known and liked
by regulars.</i>

14:26.534 --> 14:27.827
<i>He's told people about me.</i>

14:28.035 --> 14:29.495
<i>Current hypothesis?</i>

14:29.703 --> 14:32.206
<i>Initial data points to Drake
being on the level.</i>

14:32.414 --> 14:33.791
Hey, Drake?

14:33.999 --> 14:37.127
Hey. Uh, Molly, this is Liv.
Liv, Molly.

14:37.336 --> 14:38.838
- Hello.
- Hi. Can we talk?

14:40.798 --> 14:42.508
Right this minute?
I'm kinda busy.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.969
- Well, it's kind of important.
- You go for it.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.345
Sorry.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.472
<i>My hypothesis
from tonight's data?</i>

14:48.681 --> 14:50.808
<i>More data is needed.</i>

14:51.016 --> 14:53.227
<i>Guess it was prudent
to slide the disposable phone
under Drake's seat,</i>

14:53.435 --> 14:57.439
<i>so I can track his movements
until the battery dies in
30 hours or so.</i>

14:59.733 --> 15:00.693
Oh, no.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.571
New New Hope?

15:03.779 --> 15:05.447
New New New Hope, actually.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.951
Initial reaction was good.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.537
Levels of zombie virus fell,
cell metabolism was normal,

15:11.745 --> 15:14.748
but then something
led to a T-cell crash,
then re-infection, then...

15:14.957 --> 15:18.043
Have you considered
the effects of Taurine on
mitochondrial metabolism?

15:18.252 --> 15:19.879
I'm sorry, what?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.548
The Taurine cocktail in
the Max Rager component
of the serum

15:22.756 --> 15:25.968
can over-stimulate
ATP production within
cell mitochondria,

15:26.176 --> 15:29.513
leaving liver cells,
especially, vulnerable
to metabolic collapse.

15:29.722 --> 15:32.141
You might want to consider
using a buffer agent or...

15:33.142 --> 15:34.101
Or not.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.437
No, no, actually, uh...

15:36.645 --> 15:37.730
You just might be
on to something.

15:38.522 --> 15:39.481
Liv.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.610
You busy?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.246
Annie Rosine's alibi
checks out.

15:54.455 --> 15:57.791
I talked to the cannery
manager, she was on shift
the night Dr. Cash died.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.043
Looks like
we're out of suspects.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.753
No, I found Dr. Benway.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.047
- I was headed
to talk to him at work.
- Work?

16:03.255 --> 16:04.757
What drug testing company
took him?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.967
Just so I know
to avoid those drugs.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.802
Actually, Dr. Benway
is no longer

16:09.011 --> 16:11.513
in the pharmaceutical
business.

16:11.722 --> 16:14.683
<i>♪ So we'll bring you
gold and treasure</i>

16:14.892 --> 16:16.477
<i>♪ From places near and far</i>

16:16.685 --> 16:18.312
<i>♪ Instead of happy birthday</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:20.439
<i>♪ We wish you
happy ♪</i>

16:25.277 --> 16:26.737
Dr. Alan Benway?

16:26.946 --> 16:27.988
I used to be.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.157
Seattle Police.
Could we talk?

16:33.494 --> 16:35.245
Eleanor Cash is dead?

16:35.454 --> 16:36.956
Sorry to be the bearer
of bad news.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.960
Just call it news.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.505
So I take it you and Dr. Cash
weren't on the best of terms?

16:44.713 --> 16:48.842
Well, thanks to her,
this is my life.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.470
No drug company will touch me
with a ten-foot pole.

16:51.679 --> 16:54.098
A decade's worth of education
down the toilet.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.766
Thanks to her, how?

16:55.975 --> 16:58.227
Well, if you're here,
you must know.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.230
We were in charge of testing
a new acne drug.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.525
Eleanor was supposed to
do the clinical interaction
studies.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.402
She must have
faked the results

17:06.610 --> 17:10.030
on that anti-anxiety
medication the Rosine
girl was on.

17:10.239 --> 17:13.867
It's the only way
that poor girl could've
reacted the way she did.

17:14.076 --> 17:17.871
Then, at the trial,
Eleanor blamed me.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.416
So, yes, thanks to her,

17:20.624 --> 17:22.376
I'm now serving crab dogs

17:22.584 --> 17:24.712
dressed like I'm in
the world's worst Adam Ant
cover band.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.297
Can you tell me where you were
Saturday night at 11:00 p.m.?

17:27.506 --> 17:31.051
Home. Alone. Weeping.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.053
My dating life isn't
what it was.

17:33.262 --> 17:35.222
Benway!
The hell are you doing?

17:35.431 --> 17:38.017
Table 12 is waiting
for their fresh and fruity
pirate booty!

17:38.225 --> 17:39.184
I need it now!

17:41.395 --> 17:43.564
Not tomorrow. Now!

17:43.772 --> 17:45.816
Now! I assume
you've heard of deadlines?

17:46.025 --> 17:49.611
I've got Lockett warming up
in the bullpen if you're not
up to it.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.198
Excuse me.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.828
- What'd you see?
- I saw Vaughn Du Clark.

17:58.037 --> 18:00.247
Dr. Cash worked at Max Rager.

18:06.962 --> 18:08.797
Dr. Cash? Never heard of her.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.466
What makes you think
she worked here?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.134
We, uh... We...

18:12.342 --> 18:13.969
- We have a source.
- Source?

18:14.178 --> 18:15.637
So, it's not just that
you enjoy dropping by

18:15.846 --> 18:17.598
every time a homicide
is committed in King County?

18:17.765 --> 18:21.393
I really should
murder somebody,
get my tax dollars' worth.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.770
So, you've never seen
this woman?

18:22.978 --> 18:25.647
Her, I do know.
It's Dr. Erving.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.067
Dawn, will you please have
Dr. Erving step in?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.152
<i>Dr. Erving
didn't come in again.</i>

18:30.360 --> 18:31.820
Again? Why?
Is she sick?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.822
Dead, actually.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.949
That's the woman
the rest of the world
knows as Eleanor Cash.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.326
Dead?

18:39.578 --> 18:43.999
Dawn, have HR
get out a listing for
a new research scientist.

18:44.208 --> 18:49.046
Oh, and send some flowers or
whatever else to Dr. Erving's
last known address.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.007
So, why would Dr. Cash
be using a fake name?

18:52.216 --> 18:53.842
Bit of a scandal
at her old job.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.969
- Can you tell us
what she did here?
- Uh, research.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.096
What kind of research?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.347
Energy drink research.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.973
We are an energy drink
company.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.475
What, specifically?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.352
CNS stimulation cascades?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.395
Amino acid
recombination chains?

19:05.604 --> 19:08.273
Effects on cell integrity of
stimulated ATP production?

19:08.482 --> 19:10.484
I understood
very little of that.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.194
How did she get along here?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.196
She ever have issues
with other employees?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.989
Well, she had issues with me.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.784
I had her demoted for failing
to deliver results on time.

19:18.992 --> 19:23.080
But I don't murder employees
over missed deadlines
as a rule.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.832
Oh, sorry, one sec. Carry on.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.754
He's not telling us something.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.048
- Probably. But what?
- I don't know.

19:33.257 --> 19:36.718
Sorry. I really do have
a company to run.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.887
By all means, come back
when you have a warrant.

19:39.096 --> 19:41.223
The door's right
where you left it, behind you.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.561
<i>You know what, Vaughn?</i>

19:45.769 --> 19:49.690
<i>I know someone who
would make a fantastic
energy drink researcher.</i>

19:59.158 --> 20:02.452
<i>That ding means
Drake is on the move.</i>

20:02.661 --> 20:05.164
<i>Drake said that Molly got
knocked up by a friend
of his</i>

20:05.372 --> 20:07.166
<i>and just needed to vent.</i>

20:07.374 --> 20:10.878
<i>Well, let's see if that
explanation stands up
to vigorous testing.</i>

20:11.086 --> 20:13.297
<i>9:00 a.m.
Drake visits his mother.</i>

20:13.505 --> 20:14.590
<i>Data noted.</i>

20:14.798 --> 20:16.925
<i>Unified theory of Drake,
still unknown.</i>

20:18.969 --> 20:22.890
And our zombie rat has gone
back to her original color.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.267
Much like our Liv.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.519
You used a Taurine
buffer agent?

20:27.728 --> 20:32.357
Yes. Thanks to a helpful,
but minor, insight from
your scientist brain,

20:32.566 --> 20:35.068
- I might be onto something.
- Keep Blaine in the loop.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.447
The last thing we need is him
dropping dead and his zombie
clients running amok.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.617
I'll text him now.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.203
What does it mean
that I find your new look
weird and creepy?

20:44.411 --> 20:47.039
It means that you spend
too much time with the dead.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.166
It's so they don't
recognize me at Max Rager.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.959
Well, for the degree I've been
creeped out by this,

20:51.168 --> 20:52.628
the clues you find better
be earth-shattering.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.546
I almost forgot.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.257
For that professional look.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.635
Literally the stuff
of nightmares.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.097
Liv.

21:04.306 --> 21:07.643
You know that this is exactly
the kind of thing you promised
Clive you wouldn't do.

21:07.851 --> 21:08.810
Then let's not tell him.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.104
Vaughn Du Clark.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.857
That man is pure evil.
I know that at my very core.

21:14.066 --> 21:17.277
Rationalization isn't just
a river in Egypt.

21:17.486 --> 21:20.113
No. No, wait.
That's denial.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.657
Never mind.
You should be good.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.875
Blaine?

21:38.632 --> 21:39.925
Blaine.

21:55.399 --> 21:56.858
What's the word?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.068
"Boo?"

22:00.028 --> 22:01.863
This is you?

22:02.072 --> 22:04.032
- You're a zombie again?
- Yep.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.076
Back on the brain gang.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.328
- Dang.
- Crap.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.080
I got the impression
we might have longer.

22:10.289 --> 22:12.582
Yeah, I don't think
Ravi factored in
mitochondrial metabolism

22:12.791 --> 22:14.584
as an effect of
the interaction...

22:14.793 --> 22:16.545
Whoa. I'm so sorry.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.755
This nerd brain I ate
is so annoying.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.717
- Um, the bottom line is...
- I'm gonna end up
a zombie again?

22:21.925 --> 22:23.468
And then die. Yeah.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.804
That's part of it, too,
apparently.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.889
Heavy, right? Anywho...

22:28.098 --> 22:29.391
Don't worry your pretty
little head about it.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.685
We got our best minds
working on a cure.

22:31.893 --> 22:35.314
Now. I assume you're here
because you need another
zombie for your freezer?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.440
Yeah.

22:37.649 --> 22:38.984
Drake Holloway.

22:39.901 --> 22:40.902
On the list.

22:42.154 --> 22:43.697
It's nice doing business
with you.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.365
Yeah.

22:54.916 --> 22:58.837
Your knowledge of what
we do here is kind of
mind-boggling, Ms. Dylan.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.882
I studied L-carnitine's role
in thermogenic reactions,

23:02.090 --> 23:05.510
but my true love
is metabolite chain effects
on cellular development.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.889
Metabolite chain effects
are a big part of our
research here.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.017
Our CEO's been
pushing us to look beyond
the average energy drink.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.269
Vaughn Du Clark.
A true visionary.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.188
Really makes this
an inspiring place to work.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.399
I'm a bit curious
why there's even an opening?

23:19.608 --> 23:22.569
I mean, are we talking
weird lab accident, or...

23:22.778 --> 23:24.154
Ah. Yes.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.907
Well, Gwen, actually,
it's a bit unfortunate...

23:27.115 --> 23:28.950
- There was a murder.
- A murder?

23:29.159 --> 23:30.911
A Super Max researcher.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.996
I heard someone
set her on fire.

23:33.205 --> 23:36.583
God. Like, a feud in the lab,
or...

23:36.792 --> 23:39.086
We didn't know her.
We don't have clearance
to the basement.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.796
There is a secret basement?

23:41.004 --> 23:42.130
Just a basement.

23:42.339 --> 23:43.590
I mean, yes,
you need clearance,

23:43.799 --> 23:45.884
but the existence of
the basement is known,

23:46.093 --> 23:49.638
so, it's technically not
a secret basement.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.265
Of course.

23:52.474 --> 23:57.187
So, what kind of toys
do they let you play with?

23:57.396 --> 24:00.023
So, there you go.
All the usual tools
of the trade.

24:00.232 --> 24:01.983
Everything top of the line,
of course.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.235
Very nice.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.487
I was expecting sequencers.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.656
Do you know,
in the basement, if...

24:07.864 --> 24:10.784
- Right. Sorry,
you don't have...
- Basement clearance.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.911
Only the Super Max team.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.872
Is there any more information
we can provide, or...

24:16.081 --> 24:17.374
- Restroom?
- Oh.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.251
Uh, down the hall on the left.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.362
Where's the B button?

24:53.076 --> 24:54.786
Hmm. Here goes nothing.

24:58.874 --> 25:00.041
<i>Unauthorized access.</i>

25:16.475 --> 25:17.726
You saw who we have?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.978
Didn't recognize her
at first, but, yeah.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.064
We're ready.

25:25.358 --> 25:28.153
Right. Detective Babineaux.
Tell him I'm at Max Rager,

25:28.361 --> 25:30.572
and if he doesn't hear
from me, he'll know
where to look.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.741
Yes. Oh! Here is
Vaughn Du Clark himself now.

25:32.949 --> 25:33.909
Thank you.

25:35.744 --> 25:36.786
Hey, boys.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.708
She wasn't really
talking to anyone.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.172
Okay, so, uh,
just to be clear.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.382
You came here

25:49.591 --> 25:51.885
without the knowledge and
approval of your superiors,
to snoop around.

25:52.093 --> 25:55.764
I just wanted to talk to
Dr. Cash's coworkers.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.517
Maybe she had issues,
or a conflict...

25:58.725 --> 26:01.394
Okay, impulse.
Impulse to incinerate
Liv Moore.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.938
Oh...

26:03.146 --> 26:04.689
Shake it off.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.234
Shake it off. Huh.

26:07.442 --> 26:10.862
- Those dorks weren't
Cash's coworkers.
- Right.

26:11.071 --> 26:15.534
Because Dr. Cash worked
in the not-at-all-suspicious
high-security basement.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.870
You wanna know
what's in that basement?

26:20.121 --> 26:21.206
Yes.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.542
Secrets.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.379
You know who else
has a secret basement?

26:29.422 --> 26:30.924
Everyone.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.425
Because it's business,

26:32.634 --> 26:34.469
and businesses compete

26:34.678 --> 26:36.721
by trying to come up with
even cooler new things,

26:36.930 --> 26:39.057
and you don't want someone
trying to copy your cooler
new thing

26:39.266 --> 26:42.936
before you're done, do you?
So you work on it in
your secret basement.

26:43.144 --> 26:46.189
I mean, Fisher-Price probably
has a secret basement,
for God's sake.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.109
So, it's possible that
Dr. Cash's death

26:49.317 --> 26:51.111
was related to trade secrets.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.238
If I could just talk to
the people in the basement.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.406
Very well.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.491
Incineration it is.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.790
I kid. I kid.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.959
You know your way out.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.253
But in seriousness,
don't come back.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.571
Come out, freak!

27:40.327 --> 27:42.871
Hey, kid. Seattle PD.
Get over here.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.541
- What?
- What are you doing
here spying

27:46.750 --> 27:49.252
- and calling people names?
- I'm trying to get a video
of the freak.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.046
My friends don't believe me.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.964
Sorry to rain on your parade,
but there's no freaks here.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.675
She's all fixed up.
Plastic surgery.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.886
So why don't you just go on
and leave her alone?

27:58.094 --> 28:00.096
No, dude.
I saw her last week.

28:00.305 --> 28:01.556
She looked like Groot.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.268
Are you sure about that?

28:05.477 --> 28:08.271
It's 1982, Purdy Street.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.731
Yeah, I'm calling
about the title.

28:10.482 --> 28:12.067
Okay, I'll hold.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.819
We need to get a warrant
to search the basement
of Max Rager.

28:15.028 --> 28:17.864
- What?
- I had a vision.

28:18.073 --> 28:21.868
He's got this secret area
down there with fingerprint
pass keys and security guards.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.620
Which is where Dr. Cash
worked, which means...

28:23.828 --> 28:26.247
Yes, that's right.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.667
Uh, who holds the deed
to the house?

28:28.875 --> 28:30.001
That's the full name?

28:32.170 --> 28:33.588
Thank you.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.924
What's the deal with
this Canadian lighter fluid?

28:36.132 --> 28:39.052
I went over to Annie Rosine's
house earlier to ask that
exact question.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.638
- What time you got?
- Almost 9:00, why?

28:41.846 --> 28:45.058
We gotta hustle.
Come on, I think I got this
figured.

28:49.187 --> 28:50.814
There we go...

28:51.022 --> 28:52.440
Time to head
to the graveyard shift
at the cannery.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.741
Miss Rosine?
Detective Babineaux.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.416
Seattle PD. Can you step
out of your car, please?

29:15.714 --> 29:17.340
What's this about?

29:17.549 --> 29:18.883
Miss Rosine, I'm going to have
to ask you to come with me.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.720
Why?
I don't understand.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.888
Dr. Cash's murder.

29:24.097 --> 29:26.558
Did the two of you plan it
together or did you just
talk her into it?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.935
- Me and who?
- You and your sister.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.854
Whose name is on the deed
to this house.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.313
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.357
The lighter fluid you used
is from Canada,

29:34.566 --> 29:37.026
a regional brand from
your home province, Alberta.

29:37.235 --> 29:38.528
It's unavailable here.

29:38.737 --> 29:39.946
Now, if you talked
her into it,

29:40.113 --> 29:41.448
- you can make things easier...
- Please...

29:41.656 --> 29:42.991
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.744
She didn't know
anything about it.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.372
Jenny Rosine?

29:49.581 --> 29:51.875
Jenny, what are they
talking about?

29:52.083 --> 29:53.376
I killed her, Annie.

29:53.585 --> 29:56.087
For what she did to you.
To us.

29:56.296 --> 29:57.839
You know how much Annie got
in the settlement?

29:58.047 --> 30:00.383
- Report says $50,000.
- Look at her.

30:00.592 --> 30:01.676
You think that's fair?

30:02.510 --> 30:04.220
To either of us?

30:04.429 --> 30:06.556
I wanted to be
an archeologist.

30:06.765 --> 30:08.099
See the world.

30:08.308 --> 30:11.394
Annie wanted to be
a television news reporter.

30:11.603 --> 30:12.854
Well, good luck, huh?

30:14.063 --> 30:16.065
Now I'm Annie's nurse.

30:16.274 --> 30:18.067
Someone's gotta do it,

30:18.276 --> 30:20.779
go out in the world,
get groceries, make it
to the drug store.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.363
What'd you tell me,
once, Annie?

30:22.572 --> 30:24.115
- You know how
the Elephant Man feels.
- Jenny, stop.

30:24.324 --> 30:27.911
So, when I managed to
track down Dr. Cash...

30:28.119 --> 30:29.412
You burned her alive.

30:29.621 --> 30:33.416
- For a mistake.
- Not for the mistake.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.585
For lying about it.
For running away from it.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.171
For never saying or acting
like she was sorry!

30:40.089 --> 30:41.049
Jenny Rosine,

30:42.509 --> 30:44.010
you have the right
to remain silent.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.223
A full Romero zombie, Ravi.

30:48.431 --> 30:49.849
Dr. Cash had one in captivity.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.851
That's gotta be what's in
the Max Rager basement.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.645
Wait, how do you know
you didn't see a zombie

30:53.853 --> 30:55.939
at some cheesy
Halloween haunted house?

30:56.147 --> 30:58.358
Or on TV?

30:58.525 --> 31:00.443
In case you haven't noticed,
our popular culture is quite
inundated with zombies.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.279
You're a scientist.
For the moment.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.490
Would your hypothesis
stand up to rigorous testing?

31:05.698 --> 31:07.242
Sure. Throw science at me.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.118
Throw some my way, too, doc.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.080
I got your message
about this promising new cure?

31:12.288 --> 31:14.624
- He used a buffer agent.
- Yeah. Of course.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.126
To normalize mitochondrial
metabolism in relation
to cellular...

31:17.335 --> 31:20.129
All right, all right,
all right. I've had about
enough of you two dilettantes.

31:20.338 --> 31:24.634
This is an
in-case-of-an-emergency
break-glass potential cure.

31:24.843 --> 31:28.221
Cured the zombie rat,
who remains,
for the moment, alive.

31:28.429 --> 31:30.473
But we have no idea
of its long-term effects.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.100
Like life itself.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.647
I am only giving
this untested version to you

31:37.856 --> 31:41.526
because of the potential
of your death leaving
Seattle zombies unfed.

31:41.734 --> 31:45.321
So it's not the love
that dare not speak its name
brewing between us?

31:45.530 --> 31:47.740
Reasonably certain.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.159
Gotta go.
Double-parked the hearse.

31:50.368 --> 31:54.163
Oh, and I hope you don't mind.
I had to let out the crotch
in those dungarees.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.587
<i>New data. 10:15.</i>

32:00.795 --> 32:03.590
<i>Drake lands at
a location downtown.</i>

32:03.798 --> 32:05.884
<i>An unlisted location.</i>

32:06.092 --> 32:08.553
<i>Hard to know what this means.</i>

32:08.761 --> 32:10.847
No, no, I want you
to ship all of it.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.766
Yeah. We're the only game
in town now, so get to work.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.352
Good.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.271
Let's call it a day.

32:18.479 --> 32:21.608
Did I tell you we buried
the competition
in the Utopium trade?

32:21.816 --> 32:25.153
Literally.
Like, in the ground.
Like, dead and buried.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.572
Or maybe
it's the other way around.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.241
Depends how long
he kept kicking after
his throat was slit.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.994
- Who was it?
- Some minor former employee.

32:33.202 --> 32:36.372
And this is fun.
He was running a funeral home.

32:36.581 --> 32:39.459
Straight out
of freshman English.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.169
Foreshadowing? Hello?

32:45.673 --> 32:48.217
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:48.426 --> 32:50.178
<i>No further observation
required.</i>

32:52.347 --> 32:55.183
<i>The subject, observed in
his natural habitat,</i>

32:55.391 --> 32:57.393
<i>has revealed himself
for what he is.</i>

33:03.024 --> 33:04.025
Drake?

33:05.526 --> 33:07.236
Working for Mr. Boss?

33:07.445 --> 33:09.447
You sure that's the
only explanation
for what you saw?

33:09.656 --> 33:11.366
Like, they don't know
each other

33:11.574 --> 33:14.077
and Drake was simply
giving a lift to a funny
little stranger in need?

33:14.285 --> 33:17.413
The theory that best fits
the data is that I've been
dating a criminal.

33:17.622 --> 33:19.832
It's a solid theory.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.418
However, the Ptolemaic theory
of the universe also fit
the data set at one time.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.754
So I'm thinking I should
confront him with my theory,

33:24.963 --> 33:26.255
see if he can offer
an alternative.

33:26.464 --> 33:28.508
Well, as a fellow scientist,

33:28.675 --> 33:31.386
who feels the data strongly
supports the theory that
Drake is a criminal,

33:31.594 --> 33:34.639
I strongly suggest that
this confrontation

33:34.847 --> 33:37.350
take place in a public place
with many exits.

33:37.558 --> 33:38.643
I know a place like that.

33:42.438 --> 33:45.400
I can't believe
we're gonna bury this.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.902
I'm a natural criminal.
I don't see the point in
being good.

33:50.863 --> 33:55.618
Huh! I mean, Dave here, is
a quote unquote, "good man".

33:55.827 --> 33:57.662
And he was riding his bike
across the country

33:57.870 --> 33:59.455
to raise money
for Jerry's kids

33:59.664 --> 34:01.958
when he gets hit
by a drunk driver.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.503
I mean, if being good
doesn't pay off in the end,
then I don't see the point.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.505
It's a fair question.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.257
The answer
I've come up with...

34:11.467 --> 34:13.302
Thank you, chief.

34:13.511 --> 34:16.014
...there is no point
in being good.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.475
It's part of the reasons
I can enjoy this scam
we're pulling here,

34:19.684 --> 34:22.395
selling luxury boxes
to bury dead bodies in.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.605
But you wanna know
the crazy thing?

34:25.982 --> 34:27.817
Even though
I know it's a scam,

34:29.402 --> 34:31.779
I went and picked one out
for myself today.

34:33.823 --> 34:35.825
Royal Windsor Mahogany.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.162
Blue silk trim.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.458
Reserved a plot
by the pond with a swan.

34:45.043 --> 34:46.377
And for what?

34:46.586 --> 34:48.171
The view?

34:48.379 --> 34:49.964
Proximity to the swan?

34:52.133 --> 34:53.468
It's just as well I'm dying.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.306
Turns out I'm a sentimental
patsy just like all of
our customers.

35:01.559 --> 35:02.977
Or I can give this a try.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.604
What is that?
Like, medicine?

35:04.812 --> 35:06.939
Could cure me, could kill me.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.151
You didn't see Gabriel die.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.403
He sort of melted
from the inside

35:12.612 --> 35:15.740
after he gave himself
one of Dr. Chakrabarti's
injections.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.076
So, in the event
I kick the bucket.

35:21.204 --> 35:23.372
It's all in there.

35:23.581 --> 35:27.335
Bank accounts, safe combos,
all our customer's info for
the brain business.

35:27.543 --> 35:29.504
You keep
the brain business going.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.047
It's in humanity's
best interest.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.548
You promise me that.

35:32.757 --> 35:33.716
Sure, boss.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.511
Yeah.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.558
- What about the, uh...
- You stay out of
the Utopium business.

35:42.767 --> 35:46.479
Mr. Boss is too smart,
he's too violent.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.982
You guys would be in
way over your heads.

35:56.489 --> 35:58.366
I'm okay. I'm all right.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.495
Anything else, boss?

36:03.746 --> 36:04.789
Just, um...

36:06.791 --> 36:08.459
My sincere and grateful thanks

36:10.086 --> 36:11.796
for your years
of faithful service.

36:12.922 --> 36:14.298
It's meant so much to me.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.308
Whoo...

36:24.517 --> 36:27.520
- Ten miles per hour.
- Look at her go,
why don't you? Ah!

36:27.728 --> 36:29.188
And this is with
just one can

36:29.397 --> 36:31.941
of the Super Max final release
version in her, yeah?

36:32.150 --> 36:35.736
Super Max magnifies
the effect of adrenaline
exponentially.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.405
As long as it's in
your system,

36:37.613 --> 36:39.448
you have all the strength
at your disposal

36:39.657 --> 36:41.784
that you might have
if your loved one were
trapped under a car.

36:41.993 --> 36:43.536
Hmm.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.955
These zombies have taught us
how to unlock our potential.

36:46.164 --> 36:48.457
And I shouldn't need
to tell you it's dangerous.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.960
Accounting-wise,
we've factored in lawsuits.

36:51.169 --> 36:54.964
There'll be violent episodes
similar to the frequency we
experienced with Max Rager.

36:55.173 --> 36:56.841
Only now, these manic episodes

36:57.049 --> 36:58.301
will be committed
by super-strong,

36:58.509 --> 37:01.220
super-fast, tireless
Super Max drinkers.

37:01.429 --> 37:05.349
Yeah, I got news for you.
Everybody's going to be
drinking Super Max.

37:05.558 --> 37:07.602
The take-away is,

37:07.810 --> 37:09.645
the only thing that can
take down a bad guy having
a Super Max freak out

37:09.854 --> 37:12.940
is a good guy chugging
a Super Max.

37:13.149 --> 37:14.150
Hey, uh...

37:14.358 --> 37:15.484
Bones.

37:15.693 --> 37:17.278
Let me get a gander
at this thing, will you?

37:17.486 --> 37:21.115
It's okay. It's okay.
I got it.

37:21.324 --> 37:25.995
So, uh, what would
happen if I were to
give her a little zap?

37:30.458 --> 37:32.460
I swear, we can't
take you anywhere.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.795
Whoa, 12 miles per hour.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.798
13!

38:05.117 --> 38:07.370
Dad!

38:09.330 --> 38:10.873
Dad, hold the door!

39:21.319 --> 39:22.486
Let me in.

39:23.154 --> 39:24.697
Dad!

39:24.905 --> 39:27.241
Let me in! Dad!

39:27.908 --> 39:29.618
Let me in!

39:29.827 --> 39:32.121
Let me in!

39:58.356 --> 40:01.067
Here you go, ma'am.

40:14.789 --> 40:15.706
Hey, Ma.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.167
Huh?

40:18.376 --> 40:20.920
Ma, I really gotta go.
All right? I love you.

40:49.698 --> 40:50.741
Yeah, Ma.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.411
Yeah, Ma.

40:54.286 --> 40:55.579
Ma, I gotta go.
