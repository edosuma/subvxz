Hi, everybody.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.354
MARION:
Oh, Howard.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.652
Thank goodness
you're here, dear.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.693
Oh, how did your physical go?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.161
- Well... -What kind
of diet did the doctor

01:37.297 --> 01:38.697
put you on this year, Dad?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.926
Mmm. There goes
that big mouth again.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.059
I'm not gonna know
for a few days, dear,

01:43.203 --> 01:45.137
until the lab tests
come through, you know.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.831
Well, I'm sure
you're gonna be just fine.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.067
Well, the doctor kept shaking
his head and going,

01:49.209 --> 01:51.177
"Uh-huh, uh-huh."

01:51.311 --> 01:53.143
And knowing him,
that's gonna cost me about

01:53.280 --> 01:55.339
five dollars an "uh-huh."

01:55.482 --> 01:58.611
Oh, keep the coat on, dear.
We're going to have company.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.312
- What? -Ben Wilson, our new
neighbor, is dropping by.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.548
Company?
But, Marion, I-l thought

02:03.690 --> 02:06.819
you'd make the potato salad
for the Leopard Lodge picnic.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.020
I brought all
the potatoes, and here,

02:09.162 --> 02:10.858
I even brought you
a new potato peeler.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.626
And he had better
be named Howard Cunningham.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.395
I'm not going to peel
and slice and cook...

02:16.536 --> 02:19.005
100 pounds of potatoes? Aw.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.473
Well, I don't expect you
to do it, sweetheart.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.476
You'll do 50 pounds now
and 50 pounds later.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.876
I know who's going to help me.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.607
Richie. Bye.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.378
- There goes the big mouth,
right through the door. -Aw.

02:32.519 --> 02:36.114
-(knocking) -Oh, that
must be our new neighbor.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.621
Oh. Here, Howard.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.319
Well, what do you want me
to do with that, Marion?

02:41.461 --> 02:42.519
(Howard clears throat)

02:42.663 --> 02:44.722
- Oh.
- HOWARD: How do you do?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.389
I'm your new neighbor,
Ben Wilson.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.025
Oh, how thoughtful- petunias.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.035
Look, they have
the roots still on them.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.037
They have the roots
still on 'em...

02:53.173 --> 02:55.505
because your dog ripped 'em
out of my garden.

02:55.642 --> 02:56.734
See?

02:56.877 --> 02:59.209
If he sneaks under my fence
again, Cunningham,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.541
I'm going to fix him,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.581
and then I'm gonna
come over here and fix you.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.013
Oh, is that so?

03:04.151 --> 03:06.483
We don't have a dog, Mr. Wilson.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.789
Hello, Spunky.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.893
WILSON: No dog, huh?
Then who's that? Your son?

03:14.394 --> 03:16.795
That's my son, wise guy.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.297
Yes, for heaven's sakes,
see, he's taller.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.063
I don't want him
in my yard, either.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.798
Well I don't want you
in my house.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.806
<i>Qfowm
{gruntsy</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:35.375
Well, should I shut the door,
or are you gonna yell some more?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.009
Uh, I better go upstairs.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.177
I got to start on my
Moby <i>Dick</i> book report.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.788
Hold it.

03:41.922 --> 03:42.980
Where's Fonzie?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.420
- Fonzie?
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.651
Well, I don't know, Dad.
Why? What's the problem?

03:46.793 --> 03:49.319
His dog, Spunky,
that's the problem.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.294
Mr. Wilson was over here,
yelling at me

03:51.431 --> 03:53.365
because he thought
I just dug up his yard.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.865
He put the blame on me.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.731
- Oh, he thought you
dug up the yard? -Yeah.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.167
(laughing):
He thought you were looking

03:58.305 --> 04:00.535
for a bone or something?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.507
- Bad doggie.
-(Spunky whimpers)

04:03.643 --> 04:07.637
Oh, I just hate it when one
of the family gets into trouble.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.772
Hey, door's open. How you doing?

04:15.522 --> 04:17.387
RICHIE:
Fonz.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.289
I'd like a word with you,
Mr. Fonzarelli.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.486
Mr. Fonza... Whoa.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.495
Yeah, our new neighbor
just came over here

04:24.631 --> 04:28.465
bellowing at me because your dog
Spunky was digging up his yard.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.369
You took flack
for me and my dog?

04:31.505 --> 04:32.972
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.540
I'll take care of this
right now.

04:34.674 --> 04:35.869
Hey, listen, Spunky.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.477
-(whimpers)
- That's right. We're gonna...

04:37.611 --> 04:38.942
Don't try to make up with me.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.343
We're gonna have
a dog-to-man talk right now.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.505
You understand that?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.549
Oh, poor Spunky.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.914
Now, look, I've explained this
to you before.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.077
You defied the Fonz.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.416
You understand what
I'm talking about?

04:49.556 --> 04:51.024
You know what that means?
You know what that means?

04:51.158 --> 04:54.855
- That means punishment.
-(groans)

04:54.995 --> 04:58.454
First thing:
this week, no veggies.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.966
Number two:

05:02.102 --> 05:03.092
no television.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.203
That's right, no television.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.600
<i>No Playhouse 90 for you.</i>

05:05.739 --> 05:09.232
Let's go. Let's go.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.436
Fonzie, your dog
watches television?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.547
He's got to. They don't
let him in the movies.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.172
Whoa.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.485
FONZIE: Spunky, for days...
for days like this.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.751
Sad. Just sad.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.758
Don't worry, Fonz.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.726
Don't worry, Fonz,
we'll cheer him up.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.264
Come on, Spunky,
this is your party.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.595
Yeah, you're a
terrific-looking dog, Spunky.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.202
You really are.
You're a great guy.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.201
I tell you.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.930
Hi, guys. Uh, what's going on?

05:39.072 --> 05:40.563
Hey, Rich, we're trying
to cheer up Spunky.

05:40.707 --> 05:41.731
Can't you see he's depressed?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.741
Yeah, it's
a Happy Depression party.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.006
I can't believe
you went through with this.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.013
Hey, Cunningham,
I tried everything.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.810
Television, he won't watch.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.179
He won't eat.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.378
I'll tell you something,
Cloris Breck and I

05:54.521 --> 05:57.490
took him to the drive-in
to see Lassie.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.719
Is he still sad,
or is he still sad?

06:00.861 --> 06:04.388
- I'll bet Cloris was happy.
-(everyone laughs)

06:04.531 --> 06:06.226
Well, I can't stay, Fonz.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.562
I... I got to finish
my Moby <i>Dick</i> book report.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.603
I'm way behind. They haven't
even spotted the whale yet.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.399
- FONZIE: Cunningham.

of cake is that, Al?

06:38.164 --> 06:39.564
It's chopped liver.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.141
you could put them

06:52.345 --> 06:53.676

06:53.813 --> 06:56.646
Oh, thanks Al,
I already have one.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.047
Just take a bite.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.017
Just a little, tiny bite. Here.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.747
Oh, yeah, it's great.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.880
He's not eating.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.549
Smelling, but not eating.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.889
All right, it's conference time.
Get over here.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.087
Aw, Fonz, seriously.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.993
I-I-I'm in trouble
with this book report.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.066
Man, I-l didn't even
see the movie.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.634
The CliffsNotes
are all sold out.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.793
I couldn't find
the classic comics.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.234
Are you finished?

07:18.371 --> 07:19.464
Yeah, let's talk.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.506
I don't know what to do.
Nothing's working.

07:21.641 --> 07:22.836
The party ain't working.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.638
He's spunkless.
He won't eat, won't play.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.372
He's in dumpsville.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.641
Well, did you ever figure
he might be sick?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.218
Why don't you take him
to the vet for a checkup?

07:32.352 --> 07:33.717
Don't you think
I thought of that?

07:33.853 --> 07:35.822
Oh, well, good. Well, when
are you gonna take Spunky?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.288
I haven't thought of that yet.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.951
Why not? I mean,
it could just be worms.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.663
Oh, wait a minute, are...

07:47.801 --> 07:50.895
are you afraid to take Spunky
to the vet 'cause...

07:51.037 --> 07:52.937
the vet might really find
something wrong with him?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.101
Oh, come on, Fonz.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.575
Look, I'll drive
down there to the vet.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.348
Okay.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.644
Aw, I hate to break up
the party. Look at that--

09:03.943 --> 09:06.310
I heard she had to go steady.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.113
- Yes.
- Joanie,

09:11.251 --> 09:13.048
I gave the vet this number
and I'm expecting a call.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.620
Now, you've been
on there for ten minutes.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.949
Will you get off?
Please, get off.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.148
Hey, what are you,
the timekeeper?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.452

I wish I had my own phone.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.762
I have to call Binky Hodges.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.095
Well, write him a whale.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.067
Uh, a letter.
Write him a letter.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.673
Oh, good, good. I'll call him
and get his address.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.237
- Brothers.
-(chuckles)

09:38.378 --> 09:40.141
- Yuck.
-(mocking laugh)

09:43.149 --> 09:44.139
Did they call?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.047
Oh, no. Not yet, Fonz.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.916
Well, it's almost picnic day.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.319
How's the potato salad coming?

09:51.458 --> 09:54.325
Howard, why don't we forget
about the potato salad

09:54.461 --> 09:56.053
and pray for rain?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.629
No.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.062
Well, then, give me a hand,
please, dear. Come on.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.258
(phone rings)

10:01.401 --> 10:03.335
All right, just as soon
as I answer this call.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.903
- What?
- Hello?

10:05.038 --> 10:08.201
Oh, it's-it's the lab
with the results of my physical.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.309
Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.174
Yeah, blood pressure normal.
Do you hear that, Marion?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.871
Not surprised.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.007
Yeah. I got a strong heart, too.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.916
No worms. No worms?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.988
Oh, Dad, um, I'm sure
that's the vet

10:23.122 --> 10:25.956
with the results
of Spunky's tests.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.958
It was just the vet.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.394
All right, Doc, hello.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.498
This is Spunky's father.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.029
Yeah, yeah.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.466
Oh, ho-hold on a minute.
Hold on a minute.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.071
He says that the tests
are negative.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.901
- You know, that...
that he's all right. -Aw. -Aw.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.440
- He's all right.
- RICHIE: Oh, good, oh, good.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.736
Yeah?

10:43.877 --> 10:44.844
What?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.002
Whoa.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.408
He just said, "But..."

10:47.547 --> 10:48.980
I can't handle "buts."

10:52.085 --> 10:54.850
Uh, hello?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.888
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh?

10:57.023 --> 11:00.550
- Oh...
- Oh...?

11:00.693 --> 11:02.992
Right, well, uh,
thank you, Doctor.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.029
Yeah.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.395
- Well...
- Well?

11:07.534 --> 11:11.061
Well, uh, he says that Spunky
is fine physically.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.401
- Hey, Spunky's fine physically.
- RICHIE: Yeah.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.135
His problem is, uh... mental.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.471
Are you telling me
that Spunky is nutso?

11:24.000 --> 11:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:37.196 --> 11:39.791
(Spunky whimpers)

11:39.933 --> 11:43.061
All right, Fonz, now-now, let's
just examine the situation.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.762
Now, physically,
Spunky is just fine,

11:45.905 --> 11:50.399
but, uh, mentally, I guess
he's a little depressed.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.412
Let's not talk like that
in front of, uh...

11:54.547 --> 11:56.572
Oh, f-fine. Well, I won't
use his name anymore.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.842
Yeah, okay.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.453
Now, uh, what would we do
if, uh, he were human?

12:00.587 --> 12:01.645
Hey, that's easy.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.312
I'd fix him up
with the Hooper triplets.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.719
They could cheer up a statue.

12:04.857 --> 12:05.916
(groans)

12:06.059 --> 12:07.720
Now, Fonz, you see,
this depression--

12:07.860 --> 12:09.226
that's just a symptom.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.091
You got to find out
what's causing the symptom

12:11.230 --> 12:12.425
before you can cure it.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.660
I understand what you're saying.
I get your drift.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.167
(sighs)

12:17.303 --> 12:19.431
What you're saying is...

12:19.572 --> 12:22.405
we got to delve into this little
fella's mind here, right?

12:22.542 --> 12:24.533
-(knocking)
- FONZIE: Enter.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.974
- Hey, Fonz, Rich.
- RICHIE: Oh, hi, guys.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.136
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey, Ralph.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.873
Hey, Fonz, we came
to cheer up Spunky.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.175
Hey, thanks, guys.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.285
Hi, Spunky.
Look who came to meet you.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.818
It's Mr. Kitty Kat!

12:33.953 --> 12:35.478
(high-pitched):
Meow.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.749
Hi, Spunky, you old dog, you...

12:37.890 --> 12:40.485
Will you get that
crazy thing out of here!

12:40.627 --> 12:43.152
Now, Webber,
will you talk to him?

12:43.296 --> 12:45.128
You study that psychology
or something like that, right?

12:45.264 --> 12:46.698
- Right.
- B-But, Fonz, my neighbor's dog

12:46.833 --> 12:48.357
howled at the mitten.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.696
Dog? Howled?

12:49.836 --> 12:52.032
- I even got it in canine.
- Barely.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.766
I was a big hit
at the pet store.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.842
Webber, sit down.
Talk to him, will you?

12:56.976 --> 12:58.342
- Just talk to him.
- Right. R-Right, Fonz.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.604
Wait, uh, Fonz, I'm not sure

12:59.746 --> 13:01.077
that Potsie is,
you know, really...

13:01.214 --> 13:03.148
qualified to help your dog.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.342
Look, don't worry,
I came prepared, Fonz.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.579
Look, I brought over the
ink blots from psychology class.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.189
Who cares if your pen leaked?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.223
- Huh? What are you talking...?
- No, Fonz,

13:12.358 --> 13:14.258
that's the, uh...
that's the Rorschach test.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.452
That's not true.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.587
Spunky's a cooker spaniel,
not a Rorschach.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.722
No, it's... it's
a psychological examination.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.835
You see, you show
a subject the cards,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.267
and then you see how
they answer the questions.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.171
- I knew that. -Works great
with subjects who can talk.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.901
Oh, Spunky doesn't have to talk.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.671
You can tell by his reactions.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.712
Oh, come on,
you got to be kidding.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.975
- No. -FONZIE: Hold it, hold it.
Webber sounds almost

13:37.116 --> 13:39.312
like he's making sense here.
Where'd you read this stuff?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.181
Oh, I didn't read it--
I heard about it

13:41.320 --> 13:43.551
from this lady psychologist
who was lecturing at college.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.555
Her name is Dr. Joyce Brothers.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.717
A psychologist for dogs?

13:48.761 --> 13:49.694
All right, now, uh,

13:49.829 --> 13:51.263
it sounds like
it could work, you know.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.660
Wait a minute, Fonz,
you don't think

13:52.799 --> 13:55.393
a psychologist is gonna be able
to help your dog, do you?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.765
Well, it's better than
showing my dog dirty pictures.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.003
Dirty pictures?

14:01.140 --> 14:03.837
What's dirty about two spiders
hanging their laundry?

14:07.113 --> 14:09.707
Two spiders hanging
their laundry?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.476
Well, maybe they're ironing.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.615
Hey, Malph, uh...

14:14.754 --> 14:16.745
why don't you drop by
psychology class tomorrow?

14:16.889 --> 14:19.222
I'm sure we can use you
for an experiment.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.417
Sure, I'd love to.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.993
We got a gig tomorrow.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.527
Will you guys cut it out!

14:23.663 --> 14:25.153
Where can I find this lady?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.027
Well, I'm assigned
to drive her to the airport.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.159
Maybe I can get her to stop by
on her way to the plane.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.567
I want to tell you something,
I want to tell you something,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.002
me and the Spunk
are very grateful

14:34.140 --> 14:36.370
for this big favor
you might do for us.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.500
Aw, thanks, Fonz.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.409
- It's not that big a favor.
- Oh.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.312
Come on, Fonz, it's your dog.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.680
All right, all right,
just a second.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.788
That's enough.
Now, get out of here.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.412
(indistinct chatter)

14:50.556 --> 14:51.888
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye, Fonz.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.959
Thanks a lot for coming over.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.062
- Hey, Spunkola...
-(whines)

14:59.198 --> 15:01.224
I hope you cheer up.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.892
<i>II</i>

15:03.035 --> 15:04.628
(crickets chirping)

15:04.771 --> 15:07.638
Oh, that's great news.
Thanks a lot.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.207
Marion, that was the lab,

15:09.342 --> 15:11.902
and they just gave me
a clean bill of health.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.273
Oh, good.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.247
I was so afraid you'd be
allergic to peeling potatoes.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.942
Marion, I would
like to help you,

15:19.085 --> 15:21.417
but I've got to get down
to the Leopard Lodge

15:21.554 --> 15:23.852
-and pick up the trailer.
- What's the trailer for?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.049
Well, I can't get
all this potato salad

15:26.192 --> 15:27.887
in the trunk of my car.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.587
Oh, no, Howard, you can't go
just yet, because...

15:30.730 --> 15:32.721
- Why not?
- The psychologist is coming by

15:32.865 --> 15:35.698
any minute, and Fonzie says
he wants everybody to be here.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.271
Oh, Marion, but what am I gonna
do with all this potato salad?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.931
Don't worry, dear,
I have it stored around.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.599
RICHIE (calls):
Mom!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.677
Mom!

15:45.812 --> 15:48.007
Do you know
what's in the bathtub?

15:48.147 --> 15:52.482
Oh, my dear! Did something
get in the potato salad?

15:52.618 --> 15:54.348
Marion...

15:54.487 --> 15:57.286
It's a cool place, Howard.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.784
Well, here's your
potato salad back, Mom.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.123
Mrs. Cleaver
was already in the tub.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.328
How many houses
in the neighborhood

16:06.465 --> 16:07.990
did you hit, Marion?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.101
Well, there's Mrs...

16:09.235 --> 16:10.464
- Oh, never mind!
- Never mind, never mind.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.628
Oh, here, dear, I'll help you.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.204
RICHIE:
Oh, hi, Fonz.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.313
Hey, uh,
how's Spunky doing, huh?

16:21.447 --> 16:23.040
Oh, he's the same.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.344
I'm really counting
on that psychiatrist chick

16:25.484 --> 16:29.148
-to help me out.
- Oh. I don't know, uh, Fonzie,

16:29.288 --> 16:31.018
I'm not so sure
about that woman.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.182
I mean, animal psychology...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.795
Hey, listen, the woman's
got to be legit.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.954
Oh, it's true, Howard--
the college hired her.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.895
Eh, good.
If she doesn't work out,

16:40.032 --> 16:42.661
we can always use
the track coach, hmm?

16:42.802 --> 16:45.203
-(doorbell rings) -MARION:
Oh, there she is, there she is.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.829
- HOWARD: I'll get it.
- All right, dear.

16:49.942 --> 16:50.807
HOWARD:
Oh, hello.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.274
(indistinct chatter)

16:52.411 --> 16:53.811
HOWARD:
How do you do?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.812
This is our daughter.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.850
Everybody,
this is Dr. Joyce Brothers.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.851
- How do you do?
- Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.386
- Come in, please.
- Please come in.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.549
I just want to say,
on behalf of me and the Spunk,

17:06.692 --> 17:09.218
I think it's fabamundo that
you came here to help us out.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.954
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.462
(Spunky whines)

17:12.598 --> 17:15.693
Are you the boy who saw
spiders hanging laundry?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.928
Oh, no, no, that wasn't me.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.369
That was, uh... my friend
with the cat on his hand.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.999
FONZIE: Oh, come on, Doc,
what about my dog here?

17:24.143 --> 17:26.111
- Yes, of course.
- What about Spunky?

17:26.244 --> 17:27.372
Everybody,
won't you please sit down?

17:27.512 --> 17:28.502
- Oh. -Oh, sure.
- Well, fine.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.047
POTSIE:
Here you go, Mrs. C.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.878
- Oh, thank you, Warren.
- BROTHERS: Now, about the dog.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.918
Various studies have shown

17:34.053 --> 17:37.887
that many animals are treated
as actual family members.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.993
For this reason, the added
responsibility given the pet

17:41.127 --> 17:43.653
has made him assimilate
various and sundry

17:43.796 --> 17:46.129
Homo sapiens
traits and neuroses.

17:46.265 --> 17:50.395
Hey, those are
my thoughts exactly.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.402
Uh, what's-what's that mean?

17:52.538 --> 17:55.530
It means you have
a very disturbed little doggie,

17:55.675 --> 17:59.736
and it's possible that
one of you here is responsible.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.870
(musical sting plays)

18:04.183 --> 18:08.746
Oh, come on, you're talking
to us as if we were suspects.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.152
Well, Doc, uh...

18:11.290 --> 18:14.089
it's got to be my f-f-faul...

18:14.226 --> 18:15.956
I mean, I-I'm
the doggie's master.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.190
I-I-I'm so sorry there, Spunky.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.459
- RICHIE: No!
-(musical sting plays)

18:21.600 --> 18:22.829
No, it isn't.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.903
It's my fault.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.063
See, I-l used to play catch
with Spunky.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.765
Every day, we'd go
into the side yard

18:28.908 --> 18:30.671
and we'd have a friendly
little game of catch.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.142
But now that I'm in college,
I haven't been doing it.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.145
I've been rejecting
that little dog.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.147
- MARION: No!
-(musical sting plays)

18:37.283 --> 18:39.149
Don't take the blame
for me, Richard.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.344
It was the other morning,
Spunky came downstairs

18:41.487 --> 18:44.946
and I was upset, and I just...
just shut the door in his face.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.957
Oh, I could just kill myself.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.960
- JOANIE: It's me! I took the dog
-(musical sting plays)

18:50.096 --> 18:52.428
for a walk the other day,
and I lost his...

18:52.565 --> 18:54.761
- HOWARD: His what?
- His squeaky little toy.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.266
POTSIE:
It's me!

18:56.402 --> 18:59.565
-(musical sting plays)
- I ate his chopped liver cake.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.603
Potsie, will you sit down!

19:03.743 --> 19:06.007
He was depressed
before the cake.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.170
Oh, thanks, Fonz.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.010
(several talking at once)

19:11.150 --> 19:12.549
HOWARD:
Hold it.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.552
Hold it!
Now, just stop all of this, huh?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.816
Do you have
a confession to make?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.686
Me? No. Nothing.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.021
Why? Do I look like a suspect?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.629
No, but...

19:23.763 --> 19:26.562
do you always wear
that silly hat?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.124
I'm a Leopard.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.798
Sorry, I'm only here
for the dog.

19:33.939 --> 19:35.498
All of these confessions are

19:35.641 --> 19:37.507
very interesting, but I
don't think the environment

19:37.643 --> 19:39.043
is the problem.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.509
Well, is that bad?

19:40.646 --> 19:42.046
Well, I don't know.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.741
It's possible that
your little animal friend

19:44.884 --> 19:47.512
is a victim of urban blight.

19:47.653 --> 19:50.987
What... exactly is urban blight?

19:51.123 --> 19:53.092
Pollution, noise, cars,

19:53.225 --> 19:55.922
the hustle and bustle
of city life.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.429
I recommend that your dog
be relieved of his misery.

19:59.565 --> 20:00.726
Heyyy!

20:00.866 --> 20:03.028
Nobody's gonna put
my dog's lights out.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.397
- No, he's a terrific dog!
-(overlapping chatter)

20:04.537 --> 20:06.004
You can't do that.
You can't do that.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.299
-(Brothers whistles)
-(talking stops)

20:07.440 --> 20:09.840
No, you don't understand.
I just mean that

20:09.975 --> 20:12.706
he ought to go
to the country for a while.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.938
Oh, you mean like...
like a farm.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.673
Yes, exactly.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.683
Clean air, hills to romp on,

20:19.819 --> 20:22.015
clover to roll in.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.053
RICHIE:
Uh, ma'am,

20:23.189 --> 20:24.747
uh, where are we
gonna find a place

20:24.890 --> 20:28.224
where he can, you know,
find hills and-and clover?

20:28.360 --> 20:32.456
Mrs. Willis sends her poodle
to a doggie dude ranch.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.692
Doggie dude ranch.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.234
RICHIE (laughing):
Doggie dude ranch?

20:37.369 --> 20:39.395
FONZIE: Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, Cunningham.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.529
Yeah, there's nothing
that's too good for my Spunky.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.700
I think I'm gonna send him
to a doggie dude ranch, yeah.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.870
Uh, Dr. Brothers,
your plane leaves in 30 minutes.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.208
Oh, we'd better get going.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.079
I'm sure your dog
is going to be just fine.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.311
Yeah, hey, Doc, let me
just tell you something, uh,

20:54.453 --> 20:56.717
Spunky and I deeply appreciate
you came here, you know?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.722
Well, I'm very glad
to meet all of you.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.553
- Yes. We'll walk you to the
door. -You're such nice people.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.922
- RICHIE: So long.
- JOANIE: See you later.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.029
This is the nicest family.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.757
I haven't yet figured out
about the potato salad,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.162
but I Will.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.792
- Bye, now. -Doctor?
Let me tell you about my father.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.063
- Yeah.
- It all started

21:12.204 --> 21:14.104
when I was born...

21:14.240 --> 21:16.208
(Potsie continues indistinctly)

21:22.848 --> 21:25.147
Yeah, and this is
his little hat, you know.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.843
Yeah, a... a cowboy hat?

21:26.986 --> 21:30.354
Well, what else is he gonna wear
at a doggie dude ranch?

21:30.489 --> 21:32.423
Oh, no, it makes
good sense to me.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.959
Oh, we used to play fetch-it
with this, you know?

21:35.094 --> 21:38.120
RICHIE: And then Spunky used to
bring the ball back to you, huh?

21:38.264 --> 21:39.959
Oh, no, no, he...
he'd run away with it,

21:40.099 --> 21:41.828
you know, like he
was running away from me.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.164
Then he'd drop it next
to the first available girl.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.602
Then I'd... fetch it.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.300
(laughs):
Oh.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.673
Oh, his favorite
chewing slipper.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.679
Oh, you know, my dad has
a pair just like that.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.806
He's still got one.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.119
Oh. What's that?

22:01.253 --> 22:03.381
It's his little jacket
right here.

22:03.522 --> 22:06.116
That's cute. It's, uh...
it's made out of leather.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.386
FONZIE:
Oh, am I gonna miss him.

22:08.527 --> 22:12.259
Yeah, but I... I figure you're
doing the right thing, Fonz.

22:12.398 --> 22:16.334
Well, if I'm doing the right
thing, why does it hurt so much?

22:16.468 --> 22:19.734
(scratching)

22:19.872 --> 22:21.067
Who's that?

22:21.207 --> 22:23.266
(scratching continues)

22:25.277 --> 22:28.304
WOMAN (calls):
Peaches? Peaches!

22:29.348 --> 22:31.407
Excuse me. Have you...

22:31.550 --> 22:35.350
Oh, Peaches, there you are.
You bad girl!

22:35.487 --> 22:37.547
I apologize for this.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.157
She's been acting
very depressed lately,

22:39.291 --> 22:41.885
and when I opened the door
to take her for a walk,

22:42.027 --> 22:43.723
she ran away
and headed right up here.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.160
I'm sorry we disturbed you.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.732
Oh, hey, say no more.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.169
My name's Eileen Wilson.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.171
Uh, we just moved in next door.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.333
Your dog Peaches
has been depressed lately?

22:57.476 --> 23:00.207
It doesn't want to play,
no energy?

23:00.346 --> 23:02.872
Oh. You see, his dog's
been having the same problem.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.907
Well, look at them now.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.883
RICHIE:
Yeah. I think what we got here

23:08.020 --> 23:10.512
is a case of, uh, puppy love.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.454
I don't think you're
gonna have to take Spunky

23:12.591 --> 23:14.184
to any doggie dude ranch now.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.453
Hey, correctomundo.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.460
However, I got
a better suggestion.

23:17.596 --> 23:20.463
Peaches and Spunky got to see
a lot more of each other.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.397
Oh, well, I never
let Peaches out alone.

23:22.534 --> 23:26.198
- I'm always with her.
- I was counting on that.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.863
Let me ask you a question.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.237
Your dog ever
dig up a bone up there

23:30.376 --> 23:32.674
at, uh, Inspiration Point?

23:32.811 --> 23:34.837
No. But it sounds like fun.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.950
- Hey, you ain't whistling Dixie.
- Come on.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.018
Oh, no, I've got
to finish my book report.

23:40.152 --> 23:43.144
I can't go up there with you.
It's due tomorrow. I...

23:44.189 --> 23:45.418
Not you, Red.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.616
The dogs.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.058
Huh?
All right, come on, let's go.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.221
- All right, all right, come on.
- Here we go.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.391
Oh, wait for me down at
the bottom of the stairs, huh?

23:58.804 --> 24:00.465
Whoa.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.917
MARION: "Make potato salad
with vinegar and onions.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.252
It's my favorite kind."

24:19.391 --> 24:23.328
It's too bad it wasn't
anybody else's favorite, Howard.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.261
So we had a little
potato salad left over.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.560
Not just a little, Howard.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.828
- Oh...
-(Marion groans)

24:30.970 --> 24:33.200
There was a lot!

24:35.941 --> 24:38.808
And I'm not taking
leftover potato salad sandwiches

24:38.944 --> 24:40.469
to school tomorrow.

24:40.612 --> 24:41.602
That's right, and don't try

24:41.747 --> 24:43.112
-and pawn them off
on me, either. -Yeah.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.444
All right,
so I made a mistake!

24:45.584 --> 24:47.712
We should've had
the kind of potato salad

24:47.853 --> 24:49.685
that has mayonnaise in it!

24:49.822 --> 24:51.722
So I goofed! I'm sorry!

24:51.857 --> 24:54.053
What do you want me
to do about it?

24:54.193 --> 24:55.183
(Joanie chuckles)

24:55.327 --> 24:56.852
