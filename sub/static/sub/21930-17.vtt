00:01.668 --> 00:04.736
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how big Halley's getting.

00:04.738 --> 00:05.937
Yeah-- where's Howard?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.105
He's changing Michael.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.740
A-All done. You know, fun fact,

00:08.742 --> 00:12.176
did you know baby boys
can pee straight up?

00:13.046 --> 00:15.780
Grown-up boys, too.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.349
Why would we high-five that?

00:19.052 --> 00:20.551
So how are you guys?

00:20.553 --> 00:21.919
Really good.

00:21.921 --> 00:23.821
Except for when we went
grocery shopping,

00:23.823 --> 00:26.090
and the checkout lady asked
when I was due.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.425
But you handled it well.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.197
Well, if you guys need help,
I'd be happy to come over.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.800
Oh, thanks, but we're really
trying to enjoy this family time

00:35.802 --> 00:37.602
before we both go back to work.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.037
Okay, well, we all miss you.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.938
You guys, too.
Bye.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.540
Ah.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.542
Boy, seeing them
all together like that

00:44.544 --> 00:48.046
has got my biological clock
ticking like crazy.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.882
Yeah, I don't think men have...

00:50.884 --> 00:52.283
I do.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.952
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.087
Hey, guys.
Hey.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.989
Good news, we have
save the date cards.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.290
Oh.

00:59.292 --> 01:02.260
Huh, didn't go with
my calligrapher. Interesting.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.196
What is this picture?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.398
Oh, it's an MRI
of our brains photoshopped

01:07.400 --> 01:08.900
to look like they're kissing.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.703
Is it too sexy?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.905
It's too something.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.175
Guys, May 12, that's exciting.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.910
I know.
Do you guys have

01:18.912 --> 01:20.712
a location yet? 'Cause you
don't have a lot of time.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.180
Hey, it took us nine
months to pick a date,

01:22.182 --> 01:24.315
and a week to decide if
brains can have lips on them,

01:24.317 --> 01:26.284
so get in the boat and row.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.062
Michael's out.

01:54.063 --> 01:55.896
So is Halley.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.998
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.767
So is she.

01:59.769 --> 02:01.202
Switch?

02:01.204 --> 02:03.404
Yeah.

02:05.441 --> 02:08.008
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

02:08.009 --> 02:09.443
So is she.

02:09.445 --> 02:11.779
I just love them so much.

02:11.781 --> 02:13.714
Me, too.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.283
My heart feels
like it's gonna explode.

02:16.285 --> 02:19.453
Of course, it's full of brisket,
so it probably will.

02:20.389 --> 02:23.290
Oh, I didn't even
know I was capable

02:23.292 --> 02:25.326
of loving someone so much.

02:25.328 --> 02:27.461
More than me?

02:27.463 --> 02:28.596
Wha-- oh, uh...

02:28.598 --> 02:30.598
I'm just messing with you.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.866
I totally love them
more than you.

02:32.868 --> 02:34.568
I get that.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.237
I would take a bullet for them.

02:36.239 --> 02:40.708
But I would get seriously
mutilated for you.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.309
That's sweet.

02:42.311 --> 02:44.345
But you should know,
if you got seriously mutilated,

02:44.347 --> 02:47.081
I might dump you.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.515
You'd be crazy not to.

02:48.517 --> 02:50.784
Even unmutilated,
I'm no prize.

02:53.356 --> 02:56.123
You know, I'm really happy
with our wedding date.

02:56.125 --> 02:59.760
The month squared equals the
square of the sum of the members

02:59.762 --> 03:01.829
of the set of prime factors
of the day.

03:01.831 --> 03:04.632
Isn't that romantic?

03:04.634 --> 03:06.500
Yes, it's like
that Shakespeare sonnet,

03:06.502 --> 03:08.035
“Shall I compare thee to a day

03:08.037 --> 03:10.604
that's also a really weird
math problem.”

03:12.074 --> 03:13.240
It's a shame you're joking.

03:13.242 --> 03:15.909
That'd be a lovely reading
at our ceremony.

03:15.911 --> 03:18.112
Well, we only have
two months to find a venue,

03:18.114 --> 03:19.546
and I had a thought.

03:19.548 --> 03:22.049
What about the Athenaeum club
at Caltech?

03:22.051 --> 03:24.985
Albert Einstein
was a member there.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.120
It's beautiful.
Yeah,

03:26.122 --> 03:28.689
and Albert Einstein
was a member there.

03:28.691 --> 03:29.857
It's close.

03:29.859 --> 03:32.259
And Albert Einstein
was a member there.

03:32.261 --> 03:34.528
And Albert Einstein
was a member there.

03:34.530 --> 03:35.809
Ah.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.043
Now you sound like a woman
who wants to get married.

03:39.513 --> 03:40.713
So you're interested?

03:40.715 --> 03:41.880
Oh, of course.

03:41.882 --> 03:43.882
Yeah, but that club
is extremely exclusive.

03:43.884 --> 03:45.884
You know, Leonard's been trying
to get us in there for years,

03:45.886 --> 03:47.052
but no luck.

03:47.054 --> 03:48.520
Well, that's odd.

03:48.522 --> 03:50.689
When I called, they said they'd
be excited to give us a tour.

03:50.691 --> 03:51.991
Well, I suppose
we can give it a look,

03:51.993 --> 03:54.026
and if it doesn't work out,
I hear that there is

03:54.028 --> 03:58.464
a nearby Chinese restaurant
that Einstein used to frequent.

03:58.466 --> 04:02.001
Or, we pick a place we like,

04:02.003 --> 04:04.136
and don't worry about Einstein.

04:04.138 --> 04:07.506
Boy, reality TV is right;
brides are crazy.

04:10.811 --> 04:13.379
So, how has it been,
being home with two kids?

04:13.381 --> 04:16.382
Oh, tiring, but super rewarding.

04:16.384 --> 04:19.551
Oh, like Pilates, yeah, got it.

04:19.553 --> 04:23.355
Honestly, it's gonna be hard
when we both go back to work.

04:23.357 --> 04:25.391
I've been thinking
maybe it would be better

04:25.393 --> 04:28.761
if one of us decided
to stay home.

04:28.763 --> 04:33.298
I don't know, I was raised
by servants, and look at me.

04:34.402 --> 04:35.734
I literally can't tell

04:35.736 --> 04:37.469
if you think that's good or bad.

04:37.471 --> 04:40.105
Well, on one hand, they filled
my tub with scented oils

04:40.107 --> 04:42.107
and brought me honeyed sweets;
on the other hand,

04:42.109 --> 04:44.510
I spent my twenties incapable
of talking to women.

04:44.512 --> 04:48.914
So you know, pros and cons.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.350
Here's my dilemma:

04:51.352 --> 04:53.419
I...
kind of want to stay home.

04:53.421 --> 04:56.588
But Bernadette is a way better
parent than I am.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.290
Wait, does Bernadette want
to stay home?

04:58.292 --> 05:00.359
I don't know. She's really
invested in her career,

05:00.361 --> 05:02.127
and she's doing great.

05:02.129 --> 05:03.929
I think it should be me.

05:03.931 --> 05:06.065
Wow, I admire you, Howard.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.366
I-It would be hard for me

05:07.368 --> 05:10.936
to buck traditional gender roles
like that.

05:12.006 --> 05:16.041
Didn't you see Taylor Swift
twice this month?

05:17.378 --> 05:21.680
Yeah, because she's hot,
not because she sings my truth.

05:24.118 --> 05:27.719
Did Albert Einstein ever sit
in any of these chairs?

05:27.721 --> 05:29.188
I think these are fairly new.

05:29.190 --> 05:31.223
But Stephen Hawking's
eaten here a lot.

05:31.225 --> 05:34.126
Yeah, but he brings
his own chair, you know?

05:35.729 --> 05:37.663
Well, it seems kind of perfect,

05:37.665 --> 05:39.131
and it's close enough
to your office,

05:39.133 --> 05:40.833
so you can use the
bathroom you like.

05:40.835 --> 05:43.569
Mm. I put a sticker
over the auto-flush,

05:43.571 --> 05:46.071
so it doesn't startle me.

05:47.808 --> 05:49.675
Here's my card.
Why don't you two talk it over,

05:49.677 --> 05:51.844
and I will check to see
if our soup spoons

05:51.846 --> 05:55.581
are “deeper than they are wide”"

05:56.717 --> 05:59.518
What? Too deep
is a ladle, not a spoon.

06:00.387 --> 06:02.754
I really like it.

06:02.756 --> 06:05.057
Mm. Oh, I must admit,
I do, as well.

06:05.059 --> 06:08.427
I-- look at how somber all
the men in these portraits are.

06:08.429 --> 06:10.629
I feel like that sets
a good tone for our wedding.

06:11.966 --> 06:13.599
Is that Leonard?

06:13.601 --> 06:17.035
Oh, no, no, these are all dead,
accomplished scientists.

06:17.037 --> 06:20.405
Leonard will only ever be
one of those things.

06:20.407 --> 06:25.177
I mean, Leonard and Penny
are right there.

06:25.179 --> 06:27.846
But he told me he checked on
our membership just last week,

06:27.848 --> 06:30.849
and we were
still 400th in line.

06:30.851 --> 06:33.152
I'm sure there's
an innocent explanation

06:33.154 --> 06:35.320
that won't ruin my day at all.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.222
Leonard.

06:37.224 --> 06:38.357
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

06:38.359 --> 06:39.424
How did you get in here?

06:39.426 --> 06:41.493
What do you mean?
Leonard's a member.

06:42.329 --> 06:45.097
You told me
it was incredibly exclusive.

06:45.099 --> 06:48.934
Y-Yeah, look, about that,
I lied.

06:50.171 --> 06:51.539
Hey, wait, you told me
it was exclusive, too.

06:51.563 --> 06:52.238
Mm-hmm.

06:52.239 --> 06:56.508
I avoided him and impressed you,
all with the same lie.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.710
Damn, Hofstadter, didn't
think you had it in you.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.514
Well, I'm not sure I know
how I feel about this place now.

07:02.516 --> 07:04.082
Then don't turn around.

07:04.084 --> 07:06.218
Cooper!

07:09.290 --> 07:12.024
Oh, good, you're here.

07:12.026 --> 07:13.525
There's...
something

07:13.527 --> 07:15.394
I want to talk to you about.

07:15.396 --> 07:17.196
We're not putting a TV
in the bathroom.

07:17.198 --> 07:19.064
That's how you get hemorrhoids.

07:19.066 --> 07:22.067
No, this is important.

07:22.069 --> 07:25.204
Uh, I was thinking
maybe one of us should

07:25.206 --> 07:27.239
stay home full-time,
with the kids.

07:27.241 --> 07:29.341
Oh great,
so I have to give up my job

07:29.343 --> 07:31.476
and everything I've worked for?

07:31.478 --> 07:34.279
Actually, I was thinking
I should stay home.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.515
Oh, so I have to abandon
my children and go back to work,

07:36.517 --> 07:39.351
while you get to stay home
and bond with them?

07:39.353 --> 07:42.521
You just said
you didn't want to.

07:42.523 --> 07:47.359
No, I don't want to have to, but
if I want to, I should get to.

07:48.963 --> 07:50.095
Do you want to?

07:50.097 --> 07:52.497
Maybe I do.

07:52.499 --> 07:54.499
What if I also want to?

07:54.501 --> 07:56.134
Well, I don't know, we can't

07:56.136 --> 07:57.269
both stay home.

07:57.271 --> 07:59.471
Don't you think
you should go back to work,

07:59.473 --> 08:01.440
because you make more money?

08:01.442 --> 08:03.575
Don't you think
you should make more money?

08:05.112 --> 08:06.612
I think it's pretty sexist
of you to say

08:06.614 --> 08:09.281
a dad can't stay home
with his children.

08:09.283 --> 08:11.750
You know what else is sexist,
the phrase “suck it,”

08:11.752 --> 08:13.752
yet, here we are.

08:16.290 --> 08:19.324
I can't believe
Leonard lied to me.

08:19.326 --> 08:20.959
What are we gonna
find out next,

08:20.961 --> 08:24.630
that he's not really
lactose intolerant, hmm?

08:24.632 --> 08:28.634
He's just friends with
an invisible trumpet player?

08:28.636 --> 08:32.203
I know you're upset, but if
we want to book the Athenaeum,

08:32.206 --> 08:34.773
we really should do it
now, and then, I promise,

08:34.775 --> 08:38.943
we'll have our whole lives
to complain about Leonard.

08:38.946 --> 08:43.649
Aw, somebody got a
head start on her vows.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.816
So do we agree?

08:44.818 --> 08:46.351
Do we want to get married there?

08:46.353 --> 08:47.919
I don't know.

08:47.921 --> 08:49.288
I mean, Einstein was a member.

08:49.290 --> 08:50.455
I like that.

08:50.457 --> 08:51.723
You know? But...

08:51.725 --> 08:56.295
Leonard's a member,
and that really steams my clams.

08:56.297 --> 08:57.562
Oh, I love it
when you're folksy.

08:57.564 --> 08:59.731
I'm just gonna call.

08:59.733 --> 09:02.501
On the other hand, shaming
Leonard during our wedding

09:02.503 --> 09:04.069
at the very place he betrayed me

09:04.071 --> 09:08.307
does have
a beautiful symmetry to it.

09:08.309 --> 09:11.443
That's nice, it'll be your first
petty act as a married man.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.480
Uh-- oh, hi, Kathleen?

09:15.482 --> 09:17.516
Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.

09:17.518 --> 09:21.053
I'd like to go ahead
and reserve May 12.

09:21.055 --> 09:22.487
Although, it is our wedding.

09:22.489 --> 09:26.491
I-- maybe it shouldn't be
all about revenge.

09:26.493 --> 09:28.660
Oh, I see.

09:28.662 --> 09:31.496
Okay, t-thanks.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.567
Someone booked our date.

09:35.569 --> 09:36.735
Uh... What?

09:36.737 --> 09:38.570
Who?

09:38.572 --> 09:41.506
Well, well, well.

09:42.943 --> 09:45.577
This is a pickle.

09:45.579 --> 09:47.346
Yes, so,

09:47.348 --> 09:49.581
if you will just move
your birthday party

09:49.583 --> 09:52.684
to a different location,
everything will be fine.

09:52.686 --> 09:54.553
Ugh, i-it's tricky.

09:54.555 --> 09:55.987
I don't want to move my party,

09:55.989 --> 09:57.756
but I also don't want
to help you--

09:57.758 --> 10:00.492
oh, wait,
I don't have a problem.

10:01.729 --> 10:03.729
No. I do.

10:03.731 --> 10:05.864
Yeah, you do.

10:09.722 --> 10:11.555
Morning.

10:11.557 --> 10:13.124
Hey, where you been?

10:13.126 --> 10:14.458
Oh, nowhere special.

10:14.460 --> 10:16.027
Just the park,
the farmer's market,

10:16.029 --> 10:17.628
then we hopped on the Gold Line
to Chinatown

10:17.630 --> 10:19.297
because it's important
for the kids

10:19.299 --> 10:21.232
to experience other cultures.

10:21.234 --> 10:23.167
What have you been doing?

10:23.169 --> 10:25.703
It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping.

10:25.705 --> 10:27.338
Oh. So are the kids.

10:27.340 --> 10:28.572
I guess they take after you.

10:31.477 --> 10:34.345
You're just trying to prove that
you'd do a better job than me.

10:34.347 --> 10:38.482
You're pretty sharp
having just woken up.

10:38.484 --> 10:41.719
Howard, we both know
you can't keep up this pace.

10:41.721 --> 10:44.889
By this afternoon you're gonna
be passed out on the couch

10:44.891 --> 10:47.491
and I'm gonna have three
exhausted babies to deal with.

10:47.493 --> 10:49.293
Not true. I got this.

10:49.295 --> 10:52.029
You know, in fact, why don't you
take the day off?

10:52.031 --> 10:54.465
Mm, fine. Maybe I'll have lunch
with Penny.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.400
Take your time.

10:56.402 --> 10:57.702
Get a massage.

10:57.704 --> 11:01.238
You deserve it after all
the sleep you've been getting.

11:03.643 --> 11:05.710
Maybe Barry will
change his mind.

11:05.712 --> 11:07.611
Hmm? Oh, I doubt it.

11:07.613 --> 11:09.347
I said some pretty
unprofessional things

11:09.349 --> 11:10.381
about his work.

11:10.383 --> 11:13.818
I may have even used
the “S” word.

11:13.820 --> 11:17.388
Subpar?

11:17.390 --> 11:21.425
I'm not proud of it, Amy,
but I have a temper.

11:21.427 --> 11:23.828
Well, I suppose we could pick
a different date.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.996
Well, it took you nine months
to choose that one.

11:25.998 --> 11:27.765
I'll pick a different husband
first.

11:30.970 --> 11:34.772
Hey, I-I just, I wanted to
apologize about the Athenaeum.

11:34.774 --> 11:36.107
Why did you lie to me?

11:36.109 --> 11:37.241
I don't know.

11:37.243 --> 11:38.943
It just seemed funny at first

11:38.945 --> 11:42.313
and then the longer it went on,
funnier it got.

11:43.783 --> 11:46.450
So, yeah, I guess that's why.

11:47.754 --> 11:49.220
That's not much of an apology.

11:49.222 --> 11:51.055
Yeah, because he's not
really sorry.

11:51.057 --> 11:53.891
Obviously, he wanted a place
to go where I wouldn't be

11:53.893 --> 11:58.062
and apparently all of outside
wasn't enough for him.

11:58.064 --> 11:59.630
Come on. I-I do feel bad.

11:59.632 --> 12:01.467
Why? Did your best friend
hurt your feelings?

12:01.491 --> 12:02.834
Come on-- Sheldon.

12:02.835 --> 12:04.869
Look, I only have time to deal
with one jerk right now

12:04.871 --> 12:07.071
and that's Barry Kripke.
What?

12:07.073 --> 12:09.306
He has the Athenaeum booked
for our wedding date

12:09.308 --> 12:10.641
and he won't give it up.

12:10.643 --> 12:13.310
Yeah, so if you could just
please leave before I get angry

12:13.312 --> 12:15.980
and say something I will regret
about your face, your height,

12:15.982 --> 12:18.849
your personal hygiene or
the fact that your science,

12:18.851 --> 12:22.186
while serviceable,
lacks panache.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.121
That's actually
one of the nicest things

12:24.123 --> 12:26.090
you've ever said about my work.

12:26.092 --> 12:27.858
And now I regret it.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.460
Good-bye.

12:32.031 --> 12:35.366
Hey. There you are.

12:35.368 --> 12:36.967
Yeah, I just wanted to stop in
and see my office

12:36.969 --> 12:38.269
before we went to lunch.

12:38.271 --> 12:40.438
Just a few more weeks,
you'll be back full-time, huh?

12:40.440 --> 12:41.906
Yeah.

12:41.908 --> 12:44.842
Uh-oh. That wasn't
a happy “yeah.”

12:44.844 --> 12:48.412
That was a “Hey, Leonard, do you
want to go to the gym?” yeah.

12:48.414 --> 12:51.048
I've just been thinking
that maybe I'd rather

12:51.050 --> 12:53.517
stay home with the kids
and be a mom.

12:53.519 --> 12:55.519
Wow. That's big.

12:55.521 --> 12:56.720
I know.

12:56.722 --> 12:58.856
Dr. Rostenkowski.

12:58.858 --> 13:00.157
I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were back.

13:00.159 --> 13:01.459
Oh, I'm not.

13:01.461 --> 13:02.827
I just came to meet Penny
for lunch.

13:02.829 --> 13:05.262
Is there anything I can get you?
Coffee? Water?

13:05.264 --> 13:07.965
No, I think we're just gonna...
Coffee sounds good.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.934
Cold brew, almond milk?
Perfect.

13:09.936 --> 13:13.504
Nothing-nothing for me.

13:13.506 --> 13:14.939
It's weird.

13:14.941 --> 13:16.974
I've been away so long
I don't miss any of this.

13:18.911 --> 13:20.444
Sorry to bother you.

13:20.446 --> 13:22.746
Dr. Lee heard you were here
and had a quick question.

13:22.748 --> 13:25.349
Fine. Put him on.

13:25.351 --> 13:27.051
Jerold, what's going on?

13:27.053 --> 13:29.553
Hope you're not screwing up
my research.

13:30.523 --> 13:32.089
You calling from a bike ride?

13:32.091 --> 13:34.058
'Cause you're backpedaling hard.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.193
All right, fine. E-mail it over.
I'll take a look.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.366
Oh, sorry. Where were we?

13:42.368 --> 13:44.168
Love your kids.
Don't miss your job.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.070
Right, right.

13:46.939 --> 13:48.372
There's nothing in the world

13:48.374 --> 13:49.907
like holding your sleeping baby,

13:49.909 --> 13:52.109
knowing you make him
feel safe and then--

13:52.111 --> 13:54.512
Oh, good, you got
the little cookies I like.

13:54.514 --> 13:56.113
I wouldn't mind a cookie.

13:56.115 --> 13:58.148
And he's gone. Okay.

14:06.559 --> 14:07.925
Hey, Kripke.

14:07.927 --> 14:11.128
Hello, Hofstadter.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.463
Why are you cleaning that out
yourself?

14:12.465 --> 14:13.898
Don't you have grad students?

14:13.900 --> 14:18.002
Come on, I can't make my grad
students do every dirty job

14:18.004 --> 14:22.039
or so I've been told in writing
by the head of Human Resources.

14:22.041 --> 14:26.010
Fair enough.
Uh, so, look,

14:26.012 --> 14:28.546
I'm here to ask you
to give Sheldon and Amy

14:28.548 --> 14:30.481
the Athenaeum for their wedding.

14:32.251 --> 14:35.052
Why would I do that?

14:35.054 --> 14:39.990
Because deep down, Barry,
you're a really good guy.

14:39.992 --> 14:43.093
But am I?

14:44.931 --> 14:47.965
Fine. What's it gonna take?

14:52.204 --> 14:55.005
Barry, I've come
to ask one more...

14:55.007 --> 14:56.740
Leonard?

14:56.742 --> 14:58.576
Wh-Why are you
doing that?

14:58.578 --> 15:02.580
Because deep down
Barry is not a good guy.

15:02.582 --> 15:06.750
He's making you clean out
barrels of irradiated grease?

15:06.752 --> 15:09.520
Yeah.

15:09.522 --> 15:11.422
I made a deal with him

15:11.424 --> 15:14.224
to get you the Athenaeum
for your wedding.

15:14.226 --> 15:16.860
Why would you do that?

15:16.862 --> 15:20.631
Because I was a jerk
for lying to you before

15:20.633 --> 15:22.333
and besides,
you're my best friend.

15:22.335 --> 15:24.201
I want you to have
the wedding of your dreams.

15:24.203 --> 15:27.438
On Mars?

15:30.209 --> 15:33.544
Okay, I want Amy to have
the wedding of her dreams.

15:33.546 --> 15:36.146
Well, thank you.

15:36.148 --> 15:37.748
But I don't want
you to do this.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.716
No, it's okay.

15:38.718 --> 15:40.050
No, it's not.

15:40.052 --> 15:42.286
We're not going
to let Barry win.

15:42.288 --> 15:43.587
Well, what are we going to do?

15:43.589 --> 15:46.790
We have a combined IQ of 360.

15:46.792 --> 15:50.361
Perhaps more if that radiation
gave you a super brain.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.997
You know what? You're right.

15:52.999 --> 15:56.600
If we work together we could
totally outsmart Barry Kripke.

16:04.777 --> 16:07.678
Leonard, my nose itches.
What do I do?

16:09.949 --> 16:12.116
Oh, boy.

16:12.118 --> 16:14.084
I really
passed out hard.

16:14.086 --> 16:15.252
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:15.254 --> 16:17.054
The kids could've screamed
bloody murder

16:17.056 --> 16:19.256
and you wouldn't have woken up.

16:19.258 --> 16:21.659
Which I know because they did.

16:21.661 --> 16:24.161
I'm sorry.

16:24.163 --> 16:26.296
Why did I think I could
do this on my own?

16:26.298 --> 16:28.599
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

16:28.601 --> 16:29.967
Parenting is hard.

16:29.969 --> 16:32.302
Like, I've seen
and smelled things today

16:32.304 --> 16:34.872
that I cannot unsee or unsmell.

16:34.874 --> 16:38.008
Thanks for covering for me.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.343
No, I mean he only drinks milk.

16:39.345 --> 16:42.813
Like, where are the colors
coming from?

16:44.684 --> 16:46.550
What time is it?

16:46.552 --> 16:48.719
Uh, it's almost 6:00.

16:48.721 --> 16:50.154
Okay. Bernadette's
gonna be home soon.

16:50.156 --> 16:51.422
We got to divide
and conquer.

16:51.424 --> 16:53.157
I'll make dinner.
You watch the kids.

16:53.159 --> 16:54.191
Uh, kids are asleep.

16:54.193 --> 16:56.660
Great, then you
make dinner.

16:58.998 --> 17:00.864
Hey, good news, Amy.

17:00.866 --> 17:02.499
We got the Athenaeum.

17:02.501 --> 17:03.734
Oh, my gosh.

17:03.736 --> 17:05.836
That's amazing.

17:05.838 --> 17:07.871
How'd you get Barry
to change his mind?

17:07.873 --> 17:09.640
Well, I couldn't have done it
without Leonard.

17:09.642 --> 17:11.108
Boy, you should've seen us
in there.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.510
We were like
Batman and Robin.

17:13.512 --> 17:16.146
Why do I have to be Robin?

17:16.147 --> 17:18.248
If you have to ask,
you're Robin.

17:19.551 --> 17:21.285
What happened?

17:21.287 --> 17:23.520
Well, we scrubbed out some
barrels of irradiated grease,

17:23.521 --> 17:25.055
rinsed off in
a safety shower

17:25.057 --> 17:28.224
and then told Barry
Kripke what is what.

17:28.227 --> 17:29.860
And he just gave in?

17:29.862 --> 17:31.929
Well, we agreed to invite him
to the wedding.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.897
Okay. No problem.

17:33.899 --> 17:35.399
- And he gets to bring a date.
- Yeah.

17:35.401 --> 17:36.734
Well, that's reasonable.

17:36.736 --> 17:40.571
A-And if she charges by
the hour, we have to cover it.

17:42.408 --> 17:44.274
What else did you agree to?

17:44.276 --> 17:49.079
Well, um, you know how Barry
has the voice of an angel?

17:49.081 --> 17:52.916
He is not singing
at our wedding.

17:52.918 --> 17:55.252
He only
wants to sing “Volare.”

17:55.254 --> 17:57.821
Oh, “Volare”.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.158
That's what he was saying.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.627
Boy, I didn't, I
did not get that.

18:03.629 --> 18:06.663
Guys, I appreciate
everything you did,

18:06.665 --> 18:09.199
but we can find another location
that's just as good.

18:09.201 --> 18:12.202
Maybe the Japanese garden
or the planetarium.

18:12.204 --> 18:14.338
The planetarium.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.773
I hadn't thought about that.

18:15.775 --> 18:17.141
That's even better.

18:17.143 --> 18:18.442
Wait, what?

18:18.444 --> 18:20.310
I scrubbed sludge for you.

18:20.312 --> 18:24.114
I may be
slightly radioactive.

18:24.116 --> 18:25.916
Oh, you're exaggerating.

18:25.918 --> 18:27.584
Don't let him touch
the silverware.

18:32.998 --> 18:35.465
Why is Raj asleep
on our couch?

18:35.467 --> 18:37.801
Oh. I needed some help
so he came by,

18:37.803 --> 18:39.369
played with the kids,
read them some stories,

18:39.371 --> 18:42.272
put them down for their nap
and made dinner.

18:42.274 --> 18:44.074
What'd you do?

18:44.076 --> 18:46.376
Ate dinner.

18:46.378 --> 18:49.679
Okay, look, I don't
think I'm cut out

18:49.681 --> 18:50.947
to be a stay-at-home dad.

18:50.949 --> 18:54.351
And since you want to,
you should stay home.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.620
I-I do definitely want to,

18:56.622 --> 18:59.689
but I know how much this means
to you and it was just one day.

18:59.691 --> 19:02.325
So, don't give up.

19:02.327 --> 19:04.995
You don't want to
stay home, either.

19:04.997 --> 19:06.663
Do you?

19:06.665 --> 19:08.031
When I went by the office
they gave me

19:08.033 --> 19:10.467
coffee and cookies
and no one peed on me.

19:11.904 --> 19:14.704
I miss that so much.

19:14.706 --> 19:19.543
Well, I love the kids,
but I also love my job.

19:19.545 --> 19:21.978
And sleep.

19:21.980 --> 19:25.015
I know. I took a two-hour nap
on the couch in my office.

19:25.017 --> 19:28.118
I took a three-hour nap on
the floor in the living room.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.053
How do you feel now?

19:30.055 --> 19:33.490
Honestly? Still tired.

19:33.492 --> 19:35.158
Me, too.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.827
I love you.

19:36.829 --> 19:38.195
I love you, too.

19:38.197 --> 19:39.663
And we'll figure this all out.

19:39.665 --> 19:43.033
Yeah.

19:43.035 --> 19:44.701
Everyone's asleep.

19:44.703 --> 19:48.371
You want to head
upstairs and...

19:48.373 --> 19:50.173
...you know.
