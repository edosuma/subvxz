00:01.084 --> 00:02.145
You could do great work here.

00:02.169 --> 00:04.129
Don't annihilate yourself
in the process

00:04.213 --> 00:06.691
just for the sake of pushing buttons
that you aren't supposed to push.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.175
Why? 'Cause it'll kill your career?

00:08.258 --> 00:11.053
Yeah, unfortunately, I think
that death ship is sailing as we speak.

00:12.638 --> 00:16.058
Maggie Brener wants to do
a feature piece on Bradley.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.894
That's good. That's good.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.105
Alex.
Do you think that she's up for this

00:22.189 --> 00:25.234
<i>Morning Show</i> feminist revolution
that you've ignited?

00:25.317 --> 00:27.152
Especially in her own home.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.396
I don't blame you for being worried
about getting lost.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.366
The fear that someone sitting
next to you is your replacement.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.034
Would you like to comment on that?

00:34.117 --> 00:36.554
- And what the fuck is going on, Alex?
- I'm going to see Mitch.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.664
I have an idea. We could go out.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.291
Paige is gone and you're separated.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.837
<i>This is the first time that we're both
unattached and we could do this.</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:47.023
I just don't know what I'm doing.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.173
Hey, it's okay. Come here.

03:29.328 --> 03:31.706
Hey, Fred, we're evacuating.
It's mandatory.

03:31.789 --> 03:34.750
Make sure they get all the animals.
The horses, the little burro.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.002
Get the fucking animals.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.128
<i>On it, boss.</i>

03:37.753 --> 03:38.754
God.

03:39.171 --> 03:43.843
I did not need this.
<i>TMS</i> should go to LA to cover this.

03:56.814 --> 04:00.067
Hey, Cory. Listen, I got an idea.

04:00.151 --> 04:01.861
<i>Can you get ahold of Bradley?</i>

04:02.320 --> 04:07.158
We're staying in the same hotel,
so let me see if I can connect with her.

04:07.241 --> 04:09.219
<i>All right,
I'll call Chip on the way to the airport.</i>

04:09.243 --> 04:11.329
<i>Get the girls to LA to cover these fires.</i>

04:11.412 --> 04:12.413
Okay.

04:33.935 --> 04:35.478
What is happening right now?

04:35.561 --> 04:39.023
Um, Lucky Lindy
landed safely in Paris, maybe?

04:40.608 --> 04:41.776
Whoa.

04:41.859 --> 04:45.071
Yes, I know my face can be startling
in an intimate setting.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.949
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:48.032 --> 04:49.909
I feel so awful.

04:51.410 --> 04:54.914
- I'm so sorry. I was a fucked-up mess.
- Oh, no. No, no.

04:54.997 --> 04:56.624
Please, don't be.

04:57.083 --> 05:00.336
We laughed, we cried,
we ate grilled cheese.

05:00.419 --> 05:01.712
It was all good.

05:03.714 --> 05:05.800
I actually did sleep in the living room.

05:05.883 --> 05:08.344
I was a little concerned
you might choke on your own vomit.

05:08.427 --> 05:10.428
The grilled cheese didn't go down so well.

05:11.264 --> 05:12.682
Please just shoot me.

05:14.183 --> 05:17.603
- Hey, Bradley. Bradley?
- What?

05:17.687 --> 05:19.689
- What?
- Bradley?

05:21.399 --> 05:25.027
It's really all good.
I was glad that I could be here to help.

05:25.111 --> 05:27.697
I wouldn't have wanted you
to be alone last night.

05:28.573 --> 05:30.199
Thank you, Cory.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.204
Being alone is highly overrated.

05:36.414 --> 05:40.084
Um, you're awfully nice for the head
of a... president of a network.

05:40.167 --> 05:43.546
Yeah, I'm actually really not.
I just like you.

05:43.629 --> 05:45.047
Here, have some toast.

05:46.299 --> 05:48.217
- Hey, you got me toast?
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.301 --> 05:50.636
- And coffee.
- Oh, I got coffee. Thank God.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.346
- Yeah, there you go.
- Thank you.

05:56.976 --> 06:01.230
In other exciting news, we're gonna
be covering the wildfires in LA.

06:01.314 --> 06:05.484
So I need you to get on a plane ASAP.
Chip has been calling your phone.

06:05.568 --> 06:07.528
Oh, my G... Holy shit!

06:07.612 --> 06:09.697
Yeah. But don't worry.
He doesn't know that I'm here.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.532
Um, you can call from the car.

06:12.074 --> 06:15.870
Okay. Even though I feel like crap,
this is great news

06:15.953 --> 06:17.639
'cause I just need
to get boots on the ground.

06:17.663 --> 06:19.206
That's what I'm good at.

06:19.290 --> 06:22.335
I actually have to go back to LA.
Pilot business, you know.

06:22.418 --> 06:24.712
Upfronts are biting at my heels.
So I'll go up.

06:24.795 --> 06:27.757
I'll pack. I'll get you some Advil.
I can take you to the airport with me.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.842
Thank you. That is so nice.

06:29.926 --> 06:33.638
But wouldn't it be a little bit strange
if we came to the airport in the same car?

06:34.597 --> 06:36.432
That's a good point.

06:37.433 --> 06:40.269
I'll get you some Advil, put you in a cab.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.272
- To LA!
- LA!

06:43.356 --> 06:47.318
Open space and Santa Anas and wildfires.

06:48.069 --> 06:52.198
Anything can happen!
Especially when it's burning down!

06:54.075 --> 06:55.660
Oh, my God.

06:59.038 --> 07:00.915
It's the grilled cheese.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.630
You know it's Sunday, right?

07:07.713 --> 07:10.591
Hey, good morning.
We gotta go to LA to cover these fires.

07:10.675 --> 07:13.803
<i>YDA</i> is fucking killing it
with Jimmy and his tearful nonnies.

07:13.886 --> 07:16.681
Chip, Chip, please.
It's really early. Just slow down.

07:17.348 --> 07:19.600
Oh, it's early? I'm sorry.
Yeah, we're all hungover.

07:19.684 --> 07:22.103
But I gotta get you on a plane
in a few hours. Come on.

07:22.186 --> 07:24.814
Seriously? Fires in LA. I, uh...

07:25.690 --> 07:28.568
That sounds a little desperate.
It's not like it's 9/11 or something.

07:28.651 --> 07:31.028
No, no. You don't get it.
This is massive, okay?

07:31.112 --> 07:35.575
We got multiple fires raging here.
We've got evacuations, homes lost.

07:35.658 --> 07:38.258
People are dying in their fucking cars
trying to escape the fires.

07:38.911 --> 07:39.912
Oh, Jesus.

07:39.996 --> 07:42.290
<i>Besides, the show could use
a little narrative shift.</i>

07:42.623 --> 07:45.710
Let's do this. These orders are coming
straight from the fucking Death Star.

07:45.793 --> 07:49.130
Chip, I'm not...
I'm not covering a fucking fire, okay?

07:49.213 --> 07:52.425
Just send Bradley.
Get her off my ass for a few days.

07:52.508 --> 07:54.886
I am trying to reach her.
But, come on, Alex!

07:54.969 --> 07:57.847
This has got to ha...
Wha... Hold on a second.

07:57.930 --> 07:58.931
What are you...

07:59.015 --> 08:02.894
Yes, yes, I know I'm not supposed to enter
here unannounced. Just give me that.

08:03.936 --> 08:05.479
Hey! What...

08:07.023 --> 08:08.274
All right, fuck you too.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.026
I can't do this anymore, Alex.

08:10.109 --> 08:14.071
I was up all night after you abandoned me,
left me to host your fucking fund-raiser.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.866
Okay. Look, I-I... I was upset...

08:16.949 --> 08:21.746
Yes, but you're always upset or stressed,
and I just cannot take it anymore. Okay?

08:23.706 --> 08:24.916
I love our daughter.

08:24.999 --> 08:29.420
But years of having a relationship
with a charming narcissist

08:29.503 --> 08:31.339
is fucking killing me.

08:32.673 --> 08:34.383
You're not in love with me.

08:35.218 --> 08:37.762
And I am not in love with you anymore.

08:43.476 --> 08:44.477
And?

08:45.937 --> 08:47.396
I want a divorce.

08:56.697 --> 08:58.574
Well, no.

08:59.742 --> 09:01.994
It's not entirely up to you,
believe it or not.

09:02.078 --> 09:04.705
Jason, this... this is why
we are separated. Because...

09:04.789 --> 09:06.350
Listen.
We don't have to do the family calendars.

09:06.374 --> 09:08.626
You don't have to host my fund-raisers
with me anymore.

09:08.709 --> 09:13.464
No, Alex. We separated because
we argue constantly just like this.

09:13.547 --> 09:14.549
Yes, we do.

09:14.632 --> 09:18.678
And because, deep down, I am furious
with you for never putting me first,

09:18.761 --> 09:22.890
and you are furious with me
because I am angry about it,

09:22.974 --> 09:25.726
and because you believe
you have a God-given right

09:25.810 --> 09:28.437
to always have the most important problem.

09:30.188 --> 09:33.734
Alex, I swear to God, if you answer that,
I will never speak to you again...

09:36.153 --> 09:37.196
ever.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.198
Fine. Fine.

09:41.909 --> 09:44.787
Okay, um, look.

09:45.538 --> 09:47.081
We can't get a divorce.

09:48.916 --> 09:51.460
- I'm already on thin ice with America.
- Oh, God.

09:51.544 --> 09:54.380
A divorce will just...
put me over the edge. And I can...

09:54.463 --> 09:57.466
This is happening, Alex.

09:58.301 --> 10:01.262
We have to tell Lizzy,
you have to tell your PR people.

10:01.345 --> 10:03.848
Because like everything else
in our personal life,

10:03.931 --> 10:06.976
it needs to be fucking handled.

10:07.059 --> 10:10.897
But make no mistake, this is happening.

10:15.735 --> 10:19.322
I've spoken to my lawyer.
I'm gonna drive and tell Lizzy tonight.

10:19.405 --> 10:21.991
If you wanna come, you should.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.705
- No, I... No! No!
- I'll meet you at 5:00. We'll go together.

10:27.788 --> 10:32.501
No, Jason, Jason, I'm sorry I did that.
I'm sorry I left you at the party alo...

10:32.585 --> 10:34.754
- We cannot tell Lizzy.
- Why?

10:34.837 --> 10:36.756
Beca... Because, because...

10:38.507 --> 10:40.176
I have to go to California today.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.514
We're covering the fires.
That's why Chip has been calling me.

10:45.598 --> 10:46.599
Alex.

10:46.682 --> 10:49.810
Please. Jason, peoples' homes
are burning to the ground.

10:49.894 --> 10:54.357
Bodies are being pulled out of cars.
This is important. Jason.

10:55.107 --> 10:56.984
We'll tell her when I get back.

10:57.443 --> 11:00.780
Fine. As soon as you are back,
we will tell her.

11:00.863 --> 11:02.865
But I am not fucking around, Alex.

11:02.949 --> 11:05.326
I'm not gonna cool down
and suddenly change my mind.

11:05.409 --> 11:07.620
I'm not thinking that.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.539
I just have to cover the fires.

11:10.998 --> 11:13.918
It's not my fault. I didn't light them.

11:24.637 --> 11:25.721
<i>Yes?</i>

11:25.805 --> 11:30.101
Hey, so sorry. I was sound... sound asleep.

11:30.184 --> 11:32.186
Um, you're right.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.981
<i>It... It's important.
Of course, I'll be there.</i>

11:35.064 --> 11:37.358
Fantastic. Thank you.
Plane can leave at 11:00.

11:37.733 --> 11:41.112
Okay, I'll see you then.
Oh, eh, um, don't bring Bradley.

11:41.946 --> 11:45.449
You just fucking told me to bring...
You know what? It doesn't matter.

11:45.992 --> 11:48.303
She's already going.
Fred wants her there. You're both going.

11:48.327 --> 11:51.372
It's gonna be a ratings bonanza.
Pack your stuff. Car's coming in an hour.

11:51.455 --> 11:52.748
Oh, fuck, fine!

12:36.792 --> 12:38.628
All right, I'm here. Let's go.

13:11.452 --> 13:12.745
Copy just came in.

13:12.828 --> 13:14.330
Oh, thank you.

13:16.249 --> 13:18.209
I'm glad we're getting out of town
for a few days.

13:18.292 --> 13:22.380
Yeah, we could definitely all use a change
of scenery, even if it's a deadly fire.

13:22.463 --> 13:24.090
Which is saying something.

13:25.841 --> 13:27.635
I'm glad you were there last night.

13:28.177 --> 13:29.512
- You were?
- Yeah.

13:29.595 --> 13:32.598
I also didn't know
half the staff doesn't trust me.

13:35.476 --> 13:36.727
Do I smell like tequila?

13:37.144 --> 13:38.271
Let me smell.

13:39.814 --> 13:41.534
Oh, wow. Nah, I'm just playing.
You're fine.

13:41.732 --> 13:44.318
Look, the staff, they barely know you.
It's only been a week.

13:44.402 --> 13:47.154
Give them some time. Okay?
You're pretty likable.

13:48.739 --> 13:49.824
Thanks.

13:49.907 --> 13:51.617
I need some coffee. You want some?

13:51.701 --> 13:53.202
- Nah, I'm all good.
- Okay.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.548
It's the travel booker.

14:05.631 --> 14:06.632
What?

14:06.716 --> 14:10.553
Most of the hotels near the fire are full
because of the mandatory evacuations.

14:10.636 --> 14:13.598
And the only one that's available
doesn't have any suites.

14:14.390 --> 14:17.685
Well, can't they kick out
some of the displaced families?

14:18.895 --> 14:20.354
I do need room for my diamonds.

14:20.438 --> 14:22.315
- So that's a "yes." Got it.
- Jesus.

14:23.316 --> 14:25.276
Who's telling people
that I need all these things?

14:25.943 --> 14:26.944
Hmm?

14:27.528 --> 14:30.239
This is why celebrities
get really crappy reputations.

14:31.407 --> 14:33.492
And by being difficult to work with.

14:35.411 --> 14:37.705
It's been two days
since the Ashley Brown interview.

14:37.788 --> 14:38.998
What's your point?

14:39.498 --> 14:42.144
What are we doing? You're gonna
have to talk to Bradley at some point.

14:42.168 --> 14:44.128
Or... Or make some eye contact.

14:44.211 --> 14:48.174
Chip, I don't give a fuck.
Just leave me alone on it, all right?

14:48.716 --> 14:51.177
I have this other natural disaster
I have to deal with.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.763
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just...

14:57.600 --> 14:59.852
<i>All right, folks,
we have just about another hour to go</i>

14:59.936 --> 15:01.604
<i>before we touch down in Burbank.</i>

15:01.687 --> 15:04.607
<i>I hope you guys
are having a good time back there.</i>

15:04.690 --> 15:06.359
<i>It's been a pleasure serving you.</i>

15:22.875 --> 15:24.252
Mommy!

15:47.066 --> 15:49.443
Let's go, come on. Hold my hand.
Don't let go.

15:57.118 --> 15:59.120
Water... Here if you need 'em.

16:01.789 --> 16:02.832
Sorry this took so long.

16:02.915 --> 16:03.916
Jesus.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.002
Any port in a storm, huh?

16:06.085 --> 16:07.461
You sure about that?

16:08.212 --> 16:10.012
Okay, guys, clock's ticking.
Let's get set up.

16:10.089 --> 16:12.091
- Yanko, meet the helicopter, please?
- Yeah.

16:17.471 --> 16:19.307
- Alex Levy?
- Hi there.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.391
Hi.

16:21.601 --> 16:22.977
Oh, thank you.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.620
We're working on the press conference
with the Malibu fire chief.

16:25.688 --> 16:28.107
Then we have the children
who survived in the swimming pool.

16:28.190 --> 16:30.669
The climate change expert.
Do we have anyone from the hospital yet?

16:30.693 --> 16:33.279
The nurse is a little skittish.
I'm working on her.

16:33.362 --> 16:34.447
I'll have a backup too.

16:34.530 --> 16:37.325
Okay, we still need an upbeat story
to wrap up with.

16:37.408 --> 16:41.037
I'm leaning towards the Good Samaritan
who rescued all the dogs.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.956
Oh, hey, uh, don't you think
that's a little bit soft?

16:44.373 --> 16:46.959
I mean, I like dogs.
But just to end the show?

16:47.043 --> 16:49.420
Well, maybe one of the dogs
had an abortion.

16:54.383 --> 16:55.968
What did you have in mind, Bradley?

16:56.552 --> 16:59.931
I don't know, maybe something about
the allocation of firefighting resources,

17:00.014 --> 17:02.308
how they prioritize
which homes they wanna save.

17:02.391 --> 17:05.561
- Hmm.
- The numbers seem to show an imbalance

17:05.645 --> 17:07.772
towards richer neighborhoods
over poor neighborhoods.

17:07.855 --> 17:11.192
And maybe that's an unconscious bias,
and maybe it's outright corruption,

17:11.275 --> 17:13.236
but either way, it's wrong.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.863
Claire actually found a video on Twitter.

17:15.947 --> 17:20.243
Some celebrities hire private firefighters
to protect their mansions.

17:20.326 --> 17:23.326
Oh, that's kind of an interesting take.
All right, can you send me the link?

17:23.371 --> 17:24.372
Yeah.

17:24.455 --> 17:26.958
All right, it is...
It is interesting. Um...

17:27.041 --> 17:30.002
It might look like
we are denigrating first responders.

17:30.086 --> 17:32.797
Uh, so I'm not sure
it's the right tone for us.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.799
I mean, we're a news program.

17:35.341 --> 17:38.469
I think our tone is the truth,
even when it's ugly.

17:38.553 --> 17:42.640
Oh, my God!
Are you going to do this every day?

17:44.016 --> 17:45.017
Do what?

17:45.101 --> 17:50.523
This I'm-so-down-with-the-people,
superior journalist bullshit.

17:51.274 --> 17:53.734
- It's really obnoxious.
- Wow.

17:53.818 --> 17:56.737
You have no respect for our show
or the work that we do here.

18:02.242 --> 18:04.763
Well, I don't need to lie to myself
about the quality of the show

18:04.787 --> 18:06.998
that you've been producing for 15 years.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.334
Okay, respectfully, we are the number-one
morning news program in the country.

18:10.417 --> 18:13.128
Which is why you're an incredible platform
to open people's eyes

18:13.212 --> 18:14.838
to what's really happening in the world

18:14.922 --> 18:17.800
instead of force-feeding them
a bunch of glossy garbage

18:17.884 --> 18:19.969
that sedates them
into thinking their lives are great

18:20.051 --> 18:21.429
'cause they saved some dogs.

18:21.512 --> 18:23.681
Why?
So we can all just fucking kill ourselves?

18:25.391 --> 18:28.394
- Okay, all right.
- Let's give that to the people! Jesus.

18:28.477 --> 18:30.197
We're all a little tired,
a little hungover.

18:30.271 --> 18:32.899
You cannot begrudge people
for wanting to feel better.

18:33.316 --> 18:37.904
It's part of the job, truth teller.
Like it or not. Oh.

18:42.909 --> 18:45.661
- Well, with all due respect, Alex...
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.078 --> 18:49.123
I think you and I have different ideas
about what this show means.

18:53.377 --> 18:56.297
Okay, I think that we're gonna run
with the dog story for today.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.550
We will dig in deeper on the private
firefighters for tomorrow's show.

19:00.218 --> 19:01.219
Great, thank you.

19:01.302 --> 19:03.429
Okay, great.
We gotta get home base locked up.

19:03.512 --> 19:05.223
Let's get moving, everybody. Thank you.

19:05.723 --> 19:07.183
Just try to get some rest.

19:20.446 --> 19:23.699
We're gonna need a bigger trailer.
We're gonna shoot the whole show out here.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.327
Well, you can see the devastation.

19:26.410 --> 19:31.123
Just miles and miles of scorched earth
and remnants of homes.

19:31.207 --> 19:34.460
And this, by the way, is only miles away
from the terrible Woolsey Fire

19:34.543 --> 19:36.379
from the fall of 2018.

19:36.879 --> 19:38.547
And meanwhile, the Santa Anas are...

19:38.631 --> 19:42.051
They're relentless,
and the blaze is only 10% contained.

19:42.843 --> 19:46.138
Hello, Mrs. Rosen? Wait, I lost you.

19:46.222 --> 19:49.517
Hello? Hello? Mrs. Rosen?

19:50.893 --> 19:52.144
Oh, fuck.

19:53.187 --> 19:57.108
Oh, there you are. Yes, yes.
We were so deeply moved by your story.

19:57.191 --> 19:58.985
We would love to...

19:59.318 --> 20:02.572
Mrs. Rosen? Are you still there?

20:02.989 --> 20:06.051
If winds pick up, there's a chance we'd
have to drop signal and go to New York.

20:06.075 --> 20:08.244
Uh, how big of a chance?

20:08.327 --> 20:14.417
In the mythology of most ancient cultures,
fire was imbued with magical properties.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.378
It's referred to as a creature
to be tamed.

20:18.212 --> 20:20.214
You understand that
when you see a fire like this,

20:20.298 --> 20:21.507
I mean, the way it moves,

20:21.591 --> 20:26.596
it seems deliberate, like it's something
with a mind that can think and plan.

20:27.096 --> 20:30.892
Are you telling me about the mythology,
or you want that in the copy?

20:31.434 --> 20:34.270
No, I'm not just telling you, Joel.
I want that in the copy.

20:35.813 --> 20:38.083
- Claire, give me the keys to this thing.
- Yeah. Will do.

20:38.107 --> 20:39.191
Mrs. Rosen!

20:39.275 --> 20:41.420
I won't pretend to know the pain
you're feeling right now.

20:41.444 --> 20:45.865
All I wanna say is,
I think your story could bring awareness,

20:45.948 --> 20:49.869
so that no other family ever has to suffer
the way that yours has.

20:50.286 --> 20:53.080
Yes, please take your time
to think about it.

20:53.164 --> 20:56.542
I'll check in with you soon. Okay. Bye.

20:59.128 --> 21:01.380
Keep that area clear.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.265
God, how are you so good at that?

21:11.349 --> 21:14.352
Speaking to people
that have had these terrible traumas.

21:15.728 --> 21:18.856
You basically just don't avoid the pain.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.776
My mom died when I was ten.
It was pretty sudden.

21:21.859 --> 21:24.695
I guess you could say
I'm smart at tragedy,

21:24.779 --> 21:26.697
which helps booking a morning news show.

21:27.281 --> 21:29.881
But there's basically nothing
anyone can say that makes it better.

21:29.909 --> 21:33.162
Just a lot of things you can say
that make it worse.

21:34.247 --> 21:35.957
I just try not to make it worse.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.711
By the way, we're about to be up
for the next 30 hours.

21:40.795 --> 21:42.255
I have Adderall if you want some.

21:45.675 --> 21:47.385
Yeah. Okay.

21:48.344 --> 21:52.306
Also, remotes are a good opportunity
to make an impression on higher-ups.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.476
Smaller crew, more face time.
People are jacked up.

21:57.270 --> 22:01.065
There's an excitement in the air.
Stuff happens on remotes.

22:02.066 --> 22:04.610
Man, I wish this wind would die down.

22:07.446 --> 22:09.907
Mrs. Rosen. Yes.

22:10.616 --> 22:13.411
Yes, we're on our way.
We'll be there soon.

22:57.705 --> 22:58.831
It doesn't work.

22:59.874 --> 23:01.959
I think they did a great job of...

23:02.043 --> 23:04.128
Putting what was on the page
up on the screen.

23:04.211 --> 23:08.132
That is an accurate representation of
what was on the page. And it doesn't work.

23:08.216 --> 23:09.926
But you greenlit the pilot.

23:10.259 --> 23:11.552
That's true. I did.

23:12.053 --> 23:14.805
So why would you do it
if you hated it so much?

23:18.935 --> 23:20.394
You follow baseball, Kate?

23:20.478 --> 23:21.938
Do I look like I follow baseball?

23:22.897 --> 23:23.898
Yes.

23:26.817 --> 23:27.860
We're talking baseball.

23:27.944 --> 23:30.071
Sometimes a guy,
he bounces around the minors,

23:30.154 --> 23:33.157
he's barely hitting his own weight,
and everybody has called him a washout.

23:33.241 --> 23:38.537
But you, you see something in him,
so you empower him.

23:38.621 --> 23:41.707
You call him up to the majors,
and the first fucking pitch he sees,

23:41.791 --> 23:47.338
he crushes a 500-foot towering home run
over the center-field wall.

23:47.421 --> 23:48.965
It's beautiful. He's a gamer.

23:49.048 --> 23:54.262
So when this guy or gal makes good,

23:54.345 --> 23:57.723
it renews your faith in the game.

23:57.807 --> 24:02.019
And in news. And in life.
It puts a spring in your step.

24:02.103 --> 24:04.831
It makes you wanna come back to the park
again 'cause it may happen again.

24:04.855 --> 24:08.192
And guess what? It does happen again,
and everything is right in the world.

24:08.943 --> 24:11.696
Famine, poverty and pestilence
are a thing of the past.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.447
A tree grows in Brooklyn. Rainbows...

24:13.531 --> 24:15.074
Are we still talking about the pilot?

24:15.157 --> 24:17.702
What else would we be talking about, Kate?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.789
Sometimes, you give a guy an at bat

24:21.872 --> 24:25.501
to show him that baseball
is just not his sport.

24:26.002 --> 24:28.421
You knew it already.
But he didn't know it.

24:28.504 --> 24:31.966
He got a big head when he was putting up
decent numbers in Triple-A.

24:32.049 --> 24:35.970
And what do you know?
He strikes out on three straight pitches.

24:36.053 --> 24:38.139
And then it happens again.
And then it happens again.

24:38.222 --> 24:42.977
So now he knows.
He's just not a big-league hitter.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.940
But more importantly, the scout,

24:48.482 --> 24:51.944
who had been championing this guy
from here to kingdom come...

24:53.905 --> 24:55.031
knows it too.

24:55.907 --> 24:57.491
And that's money well spent.

24:57.575 --> 25:00.870
So, no, I'm not picking it up.
And I'm okay with it.

25:00.953 --> 25:03.581
Charlie Black just showed up.
He wants to talk to you.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.544
Okay. Class dismissed.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.966
<i>Chipper. What's up?
What can I help you with?</i>

25:14.967 --> 25:17.595
It's a little weird seeing you here
with your other hat on.

25:18.262 --> 25:21.182
Well, hats look weird on me in general.
I get it.

25:21.265 --> 25:24.227
In addition to which, my heart is fully
in the news division right now,

25:24.310 --> 25:25.686
for better or worse.

25:25.770 --> 25:30.274
Well, good luck with that.
She can be a cruel mistress, as they say.

25:30.358 --> 25:31.567
Um...

25:31.651 --> 25:36.781
Speaking of which, um, look, you know,
I do understand what's happening here.

25:36.864 --> 25:39.742
You know, if push comes to shove,
I'm gonna be the first one to die.

25:39.825 --> 25:41.118
You're not wrong. Sorry.

25:41.202 --> 25:43.704
And maybe I shouldn't be
bringing this to you,

25:43.788 --> 25:48.292
but I have very few options
and increasingly less to lose.

25:48.376 --> 25:50.753
So, fuck it, here goes.

25:50.836 --> 25:54.257
Look, TV, at this level, is...

25:54.924 --> 25:57.969
It's like the Mafia, you know.

25:58.052 --> 26:00.888
We got a don in a precarious position,

26:00.972 --> 26:04.350
and, as a result,
he's gonna have me whacked.

26:04.433 --> 26:09.480
And, you know, I... I need protection.

26:10.314 --> 26:14.068
So you're coming to the underboss
to propose a coup?

26:15.403 --> 26:18.781
Somehow,
you have come out of this pretty golden.

26:18.864 --> 26:24.787
And I am sure it has crossed your mind
that, uh, Fred's left holding the bag,

26:24.870 --> 26:26.163
and you're kicking ass,

26:26.247 --> 26:30.209
then you could quickly
find yourself in Fred's seat.

26:32.086 --> 26:33.588
Crossed my mind.

26:36.424 --> 26:38.759
So here's the thing.
I wanna help put you there.

26:42.054 --> 26:43.514
How would that happen?

26:43.598 --> 26:46.475
To be honest, I've never done anything
like this before, okay?

26:46.559 --> 26:49.478
But these things have a way
of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

26:49.562 --> 26:51.480
You know, they...
People hint at a shake-up.

26:51.564 --> 26:57.028
They hint that young hotshot Cory Ellison
is going to succeed Fred Micklen.

26:57.111 --> 27:01.574
And before you know it, you know...
I... I like your chances.

27:02.575 --> 27:05.119
We are the press. You know?

27:05.202 --> 27:08.998
And while I can't have the story placed
at our show, obviously, like,

27:09.624 --> 27:12.293
I've been around a while,
I do have clout, I do have credibility.

27:12.376 --> 27:14.420
And I got a lot of political capital
saved up,

27:14.503 --> 27:17.340
and I can spend that shit
getting the story placed...

27:18.382 --> 27:21.010
at any number of outlets.

27:22.345 --> 27:23.763
It's intriguing.

27:24.472 --> 27:27.225
But I don't see Fred getting taken out

27:27.308 --> 27:29.685
unless something specific
comes out on him.

27:30.770 --> 27:33.773
- Like what?
- I don't know, Chip, like what?

27:41.948 --> 27:44.075
I gotta be honest with you, man,
I don't know.

27:45.117 --> 27:46.827
I'd have to think about that.

27:48.204 --> 27:50.998
Organized crime is harder than it looks,
isn't it?

27:51.916 --> 27:52.917
Yeah, it is.

27:53.376 --> 27:54.543
Think about it.

27:54.877 --> 27:56.837
All right. Um...

27:59.465 --> 28:00.841
Thank you for talking to me.

28:01.384 --> 28:06.389
Yeah. Good luck
with that moral compass of yours.

28:13.563 --> 28:16.857
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

28:18.651 --> 28:20.570
That's on the C block. That's C block.

28:24.949 --> 28:28.786
You don't have to wear the mask,
but you have to take it. Just take it.

28:29.537 --> 28:31.497
Oh. I'll help.

28:31.581 --> 28:33.416
Take these and pass them out.

28:33.499 --> 28:35.876
Can you give one of these to Bradley?
She's in her trailer.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.963
Then we can put that in. That'll fit.
Does that work for you, Yanko?

28:39.046 --> 28:41.608
- It's not about me. It's about the fires.
- Apparently you minded about... What?

28:41.632 --> 28:43.360
- That looks good. I like that.
- Okay. All right.

28:43.384 --> 28:44.635
That's all I can do.

28:51.726 --> 28:52.768
Mask.

28:53.561 --> 28:56.606
Bradley, I'm supposed to give you a mask.
It's network policy.

28:56.689 --> 28:57.899
Oh, hey, thanks.

28:57.982 --> 29:01.277
Did you find this article about the actor
that hired the private firefighters?

29:01.360 --> 29:02.987
Yeah, that was me.

29:03.070 --> 29:07.825
This is great stuff. This is fascinating.
Really fucked-up, but fascinating.

29:07.909 --> 29:08.910
Thanks.

29:08.993 --> 29:12.663
If you find another fucked-up story like
this, don't hesitate to bring it to me.

29:13.164 --> 29:14.957
- Oh. Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

29:15.041 --> 29:16.417
- I will.
- Thanks.

29:17.251 --> 29:19.629
- Claire?
- Yes.

29:20.212 --> 29:22.089
What are your goals around here?

29:22.173 --> 29:25.676
Oh, uh, well, to be completely honest,
I'm still feeling it out.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.764
I'm fascinated by so much of it.
Like, maybe on-air, maybe an EP.

29:29.847 --> 29:32.225
Also I can just see myself
running an entire network.

29:34.602 --> 29:37.313
Okay, well, um,
I've been interviewing assistants.

29:38.397 --> 29:39.732
How's that going?

29:39.815 --> 29:41.400
You know, to be honest, not great.

29:41.484 --> 29:43.754
They just keep sending me
the same cookie-cutter, Ivy League...

29:43.778 --> 29:48.449
Hire me! I'm extremely smart.
I'm incredibly hardworking.

29:48.532 --> 29:51.202
I already know everything about the show
and how to get shit done.

29:51.285 --> 29:53.579
But mainly,
I really want to learn from you.

29:54.163 --> 29:56.999
I realize you maybe weren't remotely
going to offer me the job,

29:57.083 --> 29:58.763
and I apologize
if I just mortified myself.

29:58.834 --> 30:00.419
But I really do mean all of that.

30:01.587 --> 30:03.673
Did you see how many bridges
I burned last week?

30:03.756 --> 30:05.466
Yeah, and I really admire it.

30:06.133 --> 30:09.720
Okay. You're funny,
and you have questionable taste,

30:09.804 --> 30:12.557
but I like that you just come out
and say what you want.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.601
So I think I wanna offer you the job.

30:16.102 --> 30:17.603
- Really?
- Yeah, if you want it.

30:17.687 --> 30:19.522
Yes! Should I just start now?

30:20.565 --> 30:24.318
I would pass out the face masks, then come
back and we can start talking about work.

30:24.402 --> 30:26.862
Amazing. Thank you.
I will not let you down.

30:26.946 --> 30:28.114
I know you won't.

30:34.579 --> 30:36.038
- Guess what?
- Hey.

30:36.581 --> 30:38.291
I just got promoted.

30:38.374 --> 30:39.417
What? You did?

30:39.500 --> 30:43.796
You are now having an affair with
Bradley Jackson's executive assistant.

30:43.879 --> 30:45.840
Come on, Claire. Come on. Please.

30:46.257 --> 30:49.176
Look, it's great news,
no, but use your head.

30:49.260 --> 30:53.055
Okay. I understand. I do.

30:58.311 --> 30:59.854
I'm proud of you.

30:59.937 --> 31:01.272
Me too.

31:03.941 --> 31:05.192
Yes. Yeah.

31:06.319 --> 31:11.407
You look very sexy out here in the wild,
you know. It's unbearable.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.701
Go away. Now.

31:15.661 --> 31:18.289
Look up. Close your eyes.

31:18.372 --> 31:22.043
Look, Alex, I get that you're upset at me
ever since that Ashley interview.

31:22.126 --> 31:26.339
Oh, God, Bradley.
My life is not all about you.

31:26.422 --> 31:29.109
- I'm sorry if what I asked you was rude.
- Guys, I got Mike from an old...

31:29.133 --> 31:31.844
Rude? Rude?

31:31.928 --> 31:33.512
Clear the set, please!

31:35.014 --> 31:39.018
Implying that I'm part
of a conspiracy of silence?

31:41.270 --> 31:42.563
How could that be rude?

31:42.647 --> 31:46.108
Fine. I got all heated up.
It was a question.

31:46.192 --> 31:48.277
My journalistic instinct
told me to ask you.

31:48.361 --> 31:51.864
Oh, that's so grand.
Your curiosity just thrills me.

31:51.948 --> 31:55.409
And I'm in awe of your instincts.
Can we just be honest?

31:55.493 --> 31:56.410
Please.

31:56.494 --> 31:58.871
- I don't like you, and you don't like me.
- I like you.

31:58.955 --> 32:01.540
Oh, come on. Why?
Why are we p... Stop pretending.

32:01.624 --> 32:03.292
Because we have to work together.

32:03.376 --> 32:05.503
Yes, I know we are in this mess now.

32:05.962 --> 32:09.507
But doing this job well requires us
to act like best friends

32:09.590 --> 32:11.509
for exactly two hours a day.

32:11.592 --> 32:14.845
The rest of the time,
we just have to be professional adults

32:14.929 --> 32:17.139
who can tolerate being in the same room.

32:17.223 --> 32:19.103
And I think we can both handle
those boundaries.

32:19.141 --> 32:21.435
I know I can. See if you can.

32:21.936 --> 32:23.563
Come on, Greg! What's happening?

32:23.646 --> 32:26.607
Yeah, we're live in 30 seconds, everyone.
Quiet on the set.

32:26.691 --> 32:27.775
Shit.

32:27.858 --> 32:30.194
<i>Okay, come on, sound, mikes, let's go.</i>

32:30.278 --> 32:32.154
<i>Here. Who's taking my coat?</i>

32:34.407 --> 32:35.700
We're live in ten.

32:37.201 --> 32:40.580
Jesus, you can't buy this kind
of production value. Holy shit.

32:40.663 --> 32:44.125
- <i>Which camera do we start with?</i>
- Standby, two. Take it, two. Cue her.

32:44.834 --> 32:46.711
In three, two...

32:49.213 --> 32:51.507
Good morning,
and thank you for joining us.

32:51.591 --> 32:53.694
We're coming to you live
from both coasts this morning

32:53.718 --> 32:57.346
with special coverage of the Huntley Fire
that has devastated California this week.

32:57.430 --> 32:58.681
Alex, Bradley.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.851
Good morning, guys.
Bradley and I are currently standing

33:01.934 --> 33:04.395
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near Huntley Canyon,

33:04.478 --> 33:07.648
where the blaze began,
and the destruction is devastating.

33:08.649 --> 33:10.192
Here's what we know right now.

33:10.276 --> 33:13.321
Seven people are confirmed dead
and dozens are injured,

33:13.404 --> 33:17.074
including four firefighters
who are being treated in area hospitals.

33:17.575 --> 33:19.577
<i>At least 40,000 acres have burned,</i>

33:19.660 --> 33:24.290
<i>and local officials estimate
that close to 1,500 homes have been lost.</i>

33:24.373 --> 33:28.085
<i>And those numbers are still going up
as the fire continues to rage,</i>

33:28.169 --> 33:31.464
only 10% contained at this hour.

33:31.547 --> 33:35.801
100,000 residents have been forced
into mandatory evacuations.

33:35.885 --> 33:39.222
It's difficult to wrap your mind
around the human toll.

33:39.722 --> 33:42.308
It really is, Alex. It's harrowing.

33:42.975 --> 33:44.352
Wow. So awful.

33:44.435 --> 33:47.396
Well, we hope that both of you
are staying safe out there.

33:47.730 --> 33:48.773
Thank you, guys.

33:49.273 --> 33:51.525
It's intense being here
in the middle of all this,

33:51.609 --> 33:54.028
but we're watching out for each other.

33:54.111 --> 33:57.740
Yes, we are.
Now let's go to a live news conference

33:57.823 --> 34:01.160
with Los Angeles County Fire Chief,
Captain Graham Sealy,

34:01.244 --> 34:03.579
<i>for an update on the rescue effort.</i>

34:03.663 --> 34:05.748
- And we're out.
- All right. It's good.

34:30.606 --> 34:31.607
Here.

34:32.149 --> 34:33.651
- Oh, thanks.
- You okay?

34:33.734 --> 34:36.487
Yeah. I'm fine. It's just the smoke.

34:39.073 --> 34:40.491
It's the smoke. I'm fine.

34:40.575 --> 34:41.576
Okay. All right.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.703
Dog guy's on next, all right?
Five minutes.

34:43.786 --> 34:44.787
Okay.

34:45.871 --> 34:49.834
Oh, come on. Okay.
You gotta really get there, okay?

34:51.127 --> 34:54.630
<i>All right, everyone,
we're live in five, four...</i>

34:57.717 --> 35:00.261
We are here live with Tim Eavers.

35:00.344 --> 35:02.178
Welcome to <i>The Morning Show</i>, Tim.

35:02.263 --> 35:04.348
Thanks so much
for being here with us today.

35:04.432 --> 35:05.433
It's my great pleasure.

35:05.515 --> 35:09.812
I've been watching you for the past
15 years through every major emergency,

35:09.896 --> 35:11.856
and I'm a huge fan.

35:11.939 --> 35:13.941
I watched your daughter grow up
on the show.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.444
-Oh, that's great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:16.526 --> 35:19.196
She's quite the grown woman these days.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.573
Color me an empty nester, you know?

35:22.742 --> 35:25.535
So, Tim,
this is an incredible act of heroism.

35:25.620 --> 35:28.331
And how many dogs
have you rescued altogether now?

35:28.414 --> 35:30.957
-Uh, eighteen. And, uh, two cats.
- Wow. That's incredible.

35:31.042 --> 35:34.462
Wow. So, Tim, take us back to that moment.

35:34.962 --> 35:39.383
<i>So once I realized that my wife
had picked up my daughter from school,</i>

35:39.466 --> 35:41.636
<i>and they were safely situated in a motel,</i>

35:41.718 --> 35:45.097
- <i>I went home to get treasured items...</i>
- This guy Tim is great.

35:45.180 --> 35:48.184
And to pick up our two family dogs,

35:48.267 --> 35:53.314
Marge, who's an old Lab,
and Tilly, who is her own puppy.

35:54.023 --> 35:57.443
Oh, that's so sweet. So you kept
the mother-daughter relationship intact.

35:57.526 --> 35:59.820
Oh, yeah, you don't wanna be
busting up a family.

36:03.908 --> 36:07.286
The smoke is really... Excuse me.

36:07.370 --> 36:08.871
What... What was that?

36:08.955 --> 36:11.207
Yes, there is a lot of smoke out here.

36:11.290 --> 36:14.877
So, Tim, once you got the dogs in the car,
then what happened?

36:14.961 --> 36:18.881
Well, at that point, the fires were pretty
close, so there was a lot of sirens.

36:18.965 --> 36:20.800
And dogs were just barking everywhere.

36:20.883 --> 36:22.802
And that's when I realized,

36:22.885 --> 36:26.138
man, there was a lot of people
like my wife and my daughter

36:26.222 --> 36:28.599
who were at work and at school.

36:28.683 --> 36:30.810
So I just started driving
around the neighborhood

36:30.893 --> 36:32.853
and checking all these different yards

36:32.937 --> 36:34.939
and finding all these dogs
that got left behind.

36:38.859 --> 36:41.112
Hey, Greg,
let's move on to the strays now.

36:41.195 --> 36:43.072
Okay, and now the strays.

36:43.531 --> 36:44.824
Yes. Okay.

36:45.575 --> 36:49.745
So, Tim, we have four of the dogs
here today that you've rescued.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.832
Let's...
Tell us a little bit about these big guys.

36:52.915 --> 36:59.672
Okay, so these guys are from a family
who, sadly, their home burnt down.

37:00.006 --> 37:04.510
I know that nobody likes feeling alone,
you know?

37:04.594 --> 37:10.516
So, if someone out there is suffering
or in emotional pain, or needs a family,

37:10.600 --> 37:13.185
they might want to adopt
one of these little angels.

37:13.269 --> 37:14.979
I wanna give you a home.

37:15.062 --> 37:16.898
Greg, what the fuck
is happening right now?

37:16.981 --> 37:18.399
She's about to lose it.

37:18.482 --> 37:21.027
It looks like this one
might have found a home already.

37:21.819 --> 37:25.239
-Isn't that right, Alex?
- It's just so emotional, everything today.

37:25.323 --> 37:28.242
What you're doing,
it's just... it's beautiful.

37:28.326 --> 37:31.996
We're gonna get through this together.
And God is gonna help us.

37:32.079 --> 37:33.390
Donny, no more close-ups on Alex.

37:33.414 --> 37:35.142
- Go right to Bradley. Stay on her.
- Cut her mike.

37:35.166 --> 37:36.751
<i>Wrap it up, now. Wrap it.</i>

37:36.834 --> 37:39.670
If you're interested in adopting
one of these incredible dogs,

37:39.754 --> 37:42.256
you can find all of that info
on our website.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.592
Unless Alex beats you to it, of course.

37:45.009 --> 37:48.262
Stay with us for more special coverage
of the Huntley Canyon Fire,

37:48.346 --> 37:49.639
here on <i>The Morning Show</i>.

37:49.722 --> 37:52.141
Okay, and we're clear. We're clear. Clear.

37:58.272 --> 37:59.273
Thank you.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.693
Uh... Excuse me.

38:04.237 --> 38:05.238
She doing okay?

38:05.321 --> 38:07.698
- That was great, okay? Thank you.
- Can I get that...

38:08.115 --> 38:10.034
Can I get that picture with her, or...

38:17.875 --> 38:19.561
- What's going on?
- You gotta do something.

38:19.585 --> 38:21.313
- She just needs five minutes.
- I don't have five minutes!

38:21.337 --> 38:23.714
- Where is she?
- She's in the trailer. Jesus.

38:24.423 --> 38:26.092
Alex, open the door.

38:26.509 --> 38:29.345
I literally need her on camera
in, like, eight minutes.

38:33.015 --> 38:35.560
I'm fine. What is the problem?

38:38.563 --> 38:40.443
- You think she's fine?
- She said she was fine.

38:40.523 --> 38:43.651
- No, she's not fucking fine. I'm going in.
- Wait, you're going in there?

38:43.734 --> 38:46.654
Yes, trust me. I am very well-versed
with people on the verge.

38:52.535 --> 38:54.954
Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?

38:55.746 --> 38:59.041
Honestly. I don't want you in here.

38:59.125 --> 39:03.921
I don't want anyone in here.
What are you trying to prove? Jesus.

39:05.756 --> 39:06.924
Oh, Jesus.

39:14.390 --> 39:16.893
Okay. Okay. Here.

39:17.935 --> 39:19.812
I got you. I got you.

39:24.066 --> 39:25.526
Just let it out.

39:27.028 --> 39:28.029
It's okay.

39:31.532 --> 39:32.950
Come here. Come here, come here.

39:35.828 --> 39:36.954
Come here.

39:37.413 --> 39:38.497
Okay.

39:42.251 --> 39:43.377
It's okay.

39:45.713 --> 39:48.966
You're gonna be okay. You'll be all right.

39:55.556 --> 39:56.557
Here.

39:58.643 --> 40:00.645
Okay, breathe. Just breathe.

40:18.454 --> 40:19.497
Okay.

40:23.042 --> 40:24.252
Okay.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.714
You can go now. I'm fine.

40:30.466 --> 40:31.759
You can go now.

40:32.343 --> 40:34.383
All right, I'm just gonna stick around
for a minute.

40:34.428 --> 40:36.556
No, no. Bradley, please.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.726
I want you to leave now. Okay?

40:42.019 --> 40:45.481
You got to see that.
You got to see me break. Whoo-hoo!

40:45.565 --> 40:48.442
You got a really great show. All right?
So, come on.

40:48.901 --> 40:50.403
Please, just go.

40:52.071 --> 40:53.197
Please, get out of here!

40:53.281 --> 40:54.657
Okay. All right.

41:00.121 --> 41:02.582
Yeah, I und...
I need somebody on standby, so...

41:03.833 --> 41:05.876
Hey, uh, what's... what's going on?

41:05.960 --> 41:06.961
She's calming down.

41:07.044 --> 41:09.589
Just give her a few minutes
and then send in hair and makeup.

41:09.672 --> 41:12.717
I'll go cover the next segment.
Beyond that, I don't know.

41:13.301 --> 41:16.637
Okay. Um... Thank you.

41:17.221 --> 41:18.472
Yeah. Of course.

41:31.777 --> 41:32.778
Hey.

41:33.321 --> 41:34.322
Hi.

41:35.531 --> 41:37.241
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

41:42.580 --> 41:47.001
So. What the hell?

41:51.213 --> 41:54.091
Jason and I are, uh, getting a divorce.

41:58.095 --> 42:00.806
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

42:00.890 --> 42:03.559
No, you know,
it's been coming for a really long time.

42:05.061 --> 42:07.647
We haven't been in a good place for years.

42:11.108 --> 42:12.443
But just...

42:13.444 --> 42:14.737
It's Lizzy.

42:17.073 --> 42:21.369
That's my family,
and I don't know what else I have.

42:22.203 --> 42:27.208
Anyway, I'll handle it so that it doesn't
hurt the show any more than it has to.

42:28.251 --> 42:30.294
I'm sure there's gonna be some fallout,
of course,

42:30.378 --> 42:34.382
but, you know, we were America's family.

42:34.465 --> 42:35.633
Fucking bullshit.

42:46.477 --> 42:47.937
That's good. Push that.

42:50.147 --> 42:53.109
Hey, uh, the press is putting out
all kinds of feelers

42:53.192 --> 42:55.027
about the Alex meltdown from this morning.

42:55.111 --> 42:56.991
No. Do not let them
make a big deal out of this.

42:57.071 --> 42:59.115
Alex Levy is not having
an emotional breakdown.

42:59.198 --> 43:03.578
She is simply moved by the fire and
the victims and all the sweet puppy dogs.

43:03.661 --> 43:05.496
- Stick to that.
- Right, copy that.

43:06.581 --> 43:08.207
Oh, shit.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.084
Hey, Fred.

43:10.167 --> 43:11.168
<i>Goddamn it, Chip.</i>

43:11.252 --> 43:13.087
Why the fuck is my property manager

43:13.170 --> 43:15.506
telling me that
there are investigators from <i>TMS</i>

43:15.590 --> 43:20.720
trying to interview the hired firefighters
working to save my home?

43:21.888 --> 43:24.891
Yeah, that's a story
that, uh, Bradley's doing tomorrow.

43:24.974 --> 43:29.270
We didn't know one of the locations
was your property.

43:29.353 --> 43:31.898
Fred! Fred, Loki's been burned.

43:31.981 --> 43:34.817
Look. I'm in hell here.
My home might burn down.

43:34.901 --> 43:37.612
I gotta find somewhere
to put Geneva's fucking horses.

43:38.362 --> 43:40.072
<i>Kill the goddamn story.</i>

43:46.829 --> 43:47.872
Fuck.

44:06.724 --> 44:08.017
Oh, Jesus.

44:08.851 --> 44:12.480
- Everything I brought smells like smoke.
- I know. It's sexy, isn't it?

44:14.315 --> 44:17.443
Oh, my God.
Fires. Fires take it out of you.

44:18.194 --> 44:20.571
I just gotta see what Chip wanted,
then I'm gonna pass out.

44:20.988 --> 44:22.865
- Good night.
- Night.

44:26.118 --> 44:28.162
I hear you. It's not my decision.

44:28.621 --> 44:30.164
But you're the producer.

44:30.248 --> 44:33.376
But it's Fred's network.
There's very little I can do here.

44:33.459 --> 44:35.544
What kind of news organization is this?

44:35.628 --> 44:37.463
I don't fucking know,
to be honest with you.

44:37.546 --> 44:39.674
I wish I had a good answer for that.
But I...

44:40.383 --> 44:43.135
I know I'm an annoying
pain in your ass, okay?

44:43.219 --> 44:44.655
But if it makes you feel any better,

44:44.679 --> 44:48.516
I've been an annoying pain in the ass
to everybody I've ever worked with.

44:49.016 --> 44:51.978
I push. It's just my nature.

44:52.478 --> 44:56.566
And, Jesus, I wish to God
sometimes it wasn't.

44:57.650 --> 45:00.695
But I've realized I can't change it,

45:00.778 --> 45:06.367
and I guess I just... I learned
to just lean into the fucking turn.

45:07.493 --> 45:10.121
Look, I get it, okay.
You don't have to apologize to me.

45:10.204 --> 45:12.331
I'm not apologizing.
I was just explaining it.

45:12.415 --> 45:14.208
I understand, okay.

45:14.292 --> 45:17.712
I see you in that room today,
pitching me that story.

45:18.671 --> 45:21.299
- It's a fucking good story.
- It's a great story!

45:21.382 --> 45:25.261
It is. And I'm the fucking asshole
who has to shut you down.

45:25.344 --> 45:28.681
And I used to be you.
That's what I used to do. I used to push.

45:28.764 --> 45:33.144
But now I'm in this position
where I can't push anymore

45:33.227 --> 45:36.898
because I have to hold the middle
from being pulled to the other side

45:36.981 --> 45:40.693
and keep the whole fucking thing
from falling down the mountain.

45:40.776 --> 45:42.987
And then you wake up one day
and you're like,

45:43.070 --> 45:48.534
"Did I used to push? What direction
did I push in when I was even a pusher?"

45:48.618 --> 45:51.746
I don't know why I keep saying pusher
right now, but it's fucking...

45:54.206 --> 45:56.476
Let's just be clear.
You're not talking about drugs, right?

45:56.500 --> 45:59.100
Oh, no, I was a drug dealer.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

46:01.756 --> 46:04.217
You're pretty funny for a broken person.

46:05.676 --> 46:07.678
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

46:07.762 --> 46:10.223
- Well...
- I want that on my tombstone. That's...

46:10.306 --> 46:13.809
Wind's shifted, guys, and we need
to pack up the site and move.

46:13.893 --> 46:15.061
- Right now.
- Okay, okay.

46:15.144 --> 46:17.480
Right now. Come on.
Cars are waiting outside.

46:20.524 --> 46:22.485
- Hey, Bradley.
- Yeah.

46:24.237 --> 46:27.198
What if we said, "Fuck Fred"
and ran the story anyway?

46:30.618 --> 46:32.328
Can you be ready in time?

46:32.954 --> 46:35.248
Ye... Yeah. Yeah.

46:35.998 --> 46:37.416
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

46:46.717 --> 46:49.971
Hey. Excuse me, guys.
Sir, can you talk to me for just a second?

46:50.054 --> 46:51.806
I'm with <i>The Morning Show</i>.

46:51.889 --> 46:55.268
How long have you and your team been
working here to save this private estate?

46:55.351 --> 46:56.477
Since last night.

46:56.561 --> 46:57.770
Do you think it's fair

46:57.853 --> 47:00.832
that certain wealthy people can afford
private firefighters to save their homes

47:00.856 --> 47:03.150
while others are forced
to brave the elements?

47:03.234 --> 47:06.153
There is no "fair" here.
People are desperate to save their homes.

47:06.237 --> 47:08.239
You can't blame them
for doing what they can.

47:08.322 --> 47:11.909
On the way here, a whole neighborhood
very close by was burned to the ground.

47:11.993 --> 47:14.745
Small homes, there weren't
nearly as many firefighters.

47:14.829 --> 47:16.549
People picking up
the pieces of their lives.

47:16.581 --> 47:17.748
What do you think about that?

47:17.832 --> 47:20.418
I wish everybody had extra money
to hire extra help.

47:20.501 --> 47:25.006
We're just doing what we can here.
This is America. Money matters.

47:25.464 --> 47:26.716
Thank you, sir.

47:26.799 --> 47:28.926
From Malibu, I'm Bradley Jackson.

47:52.450 --> 47:53.910
Fuck you, Fred.

48:46.254 --> 48:47.296
Claire.

48:47.713 --> 48:49.840
You felt too far away.

49:06.899 --> 49:08.568
What are you doing?

49:12.488 --> 49:13.531
Coming.

49:20.746 --> 49:21.747
Hey.

49:22.081 --> 49:23.082
Hi.

49:28.546 --> 49:30.965
I ju... I just wanted you to know

49:31.048 --> 49:37.930
that I know
that I've been really erratic today.

49:39.807 --> 49:40.808
Okay.

49:42.351 --> 49:46.022
Um, there's... There's more. Um...

49:50.109 --> 49:55.364
Also, the reason
that I lost my shit earlier is that, um...

49:58.034 --> 50:00.036
I'm getting a divorce.

50:01.537 --> 50:02.538
Oh.

50:03.998 --> 50:05.416
I'm sorry.

50:05.875 --> 50:08.252
It's okay. I'll live.

50:10.504 --> 50:12.006
Is there anything I can do?

50:12.089 --> 50:14.258
No, don't... No.

50:17.887 --> 50:19.305
It's just, uh...

50:22.391 --> 50:23.601
my daughter.

50:26.270 --> 50:27.647
I don't want to lose her.

50:27.730 --> 50:30.566
I know she is gonna blame me,
and she's going to blame my job.

50:31.025 --> 50:32.109
And...

50:34.153 --> 50:36.822
I just can't stand the idea
of my daughter...

50:38.199 --> 50:39.951
thinking badly of me.

50:44.413 --> 50:45.915
That's a lot to carry.

50:47.875 --> 50:48.876
Yeah.

50:51.671 --> 50:52.922
Okay, good night.

51:14.902 --> 51:15.987
Alex!

51:17.154 --> 51:18.447
- Hey.
- Yeah?

51:23.286 --> 51:28.040
Look, life is messy.
Everybody's life is messy and complicated.

51:28.457 --> 51:31.877
Parents and kids, it's a lot.

51:33.004 --> 51:35.840
And, uh, my... my mom is a fucking mess.

51:36.632 --> 51:38.843
I don't know what to do with her
half the time.

51:40.344 --> 51:45.474
And it's probably because...
my dad was a real bad drunk,

51:45.558 --> 51:51.063
and... one time he was driving the car,
and he killed a kid.

51:55.443 --> 51:59.655
And I only say that
because I was furious with my dad.

52:00.448 --> 52:02.450
And I pushed him out of my life.

52:03.659 --> 52:05.661
But I never stopped loving him.

52:07.580 --> 52:11.167
And that's... that's just how it is
with parents and kids.

52:13.044 --> 52:17.048
And I guarantee, no matter
what you didn't do for your daughter,

52:17.131 --> 52:20.426
that you think you didn't make
some perfect life,

52:20.509 --> 52:23.054
whatever the fuck that is, for her,

52:24.555 --> 52:26.682
she loves you so much.

52:28.893 --> 52:30.019
Thank you.

52:33.522 --> 52:38.110
You're actually pretty lovable
when you're not acting like a wet cat.

52:40.446 --> 52:43.574
And I want you to know
that you can trust me.

52:44.575 --> 52:48.496
You can tell me things.
You can be vulnerable. It's okay.

52:51.958 --> 52:55.211
Okay. Thank you.

52:57.004 --> 52:58.756
- Night.
- Good night.

54:17.209 --> 54:18.794
Hey, Cory. It's Chip.

54:18.878 --> 54:20.439
<i>What's up?</i>

54:20.463 --> 54:22.256
Uh, I think I'm ready to talk.
