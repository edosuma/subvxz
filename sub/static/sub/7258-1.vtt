WEBVTT

00:19.113 --> 00:22.950
We have seen a star in the east.

00:24.702 --> 00:29.373
It told us
the Son of God is born.

01:01.446 --> 01:05.241
Nativity Play/Sermon/Dinner

01:05.450 --> 01:08.244
The Lord Jesus
was laid in a manger...

01:08.411 --> 01:11.998
...to bring salvation
to the souls of those...

01:12.165 --> 01:15.210
...with no place of their own.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.671
Nothing is harder
than to have no place...

01:18.838 --> 01:22.759
...but many are those
without one.

01:23.009 --> 01:24.219
Tell me about it!

01:24.427 --> 01:27.680
In their solitude,
they long for someone who will say:

01:27.847 --> 01:29.140
"I want you to be here."

01:29.390 --> 01:30.767
Not me, thanks.

01:30.934 --> 01:32.060
Be quiet!

01:32.435 --> 01:37.815
Jesus was born to offer those alone
a place in which to be alive!

01:40.735 --> 01:43.029
"Joy to the world,
the food has come."

01:43.238 --> 01:45.782
Gin! It's "the Lord has come"!

01:46.366 --> 01:48.159
You don't know much, do you?

01:48.368 --> 01:50.869
More than some faggot.

01:51.036 --> 01:54.289
I am a mistake made by God.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.125
In my heart, I am a woman.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.169
Women can have children.

01:59.711 --> 02:03.131
What if a miracle like
the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...

02:03.298 --> 02:05.968
...was to happen to a homo?

02:06.510 --> 02:12.641
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I'm eating for two.

02:37.207 --> 02:38.584
Serves you right!

02:41.712 --> 02:42.796
Miyuki!

02:44.131 --> 02:46.008
Time to eat!

02:49.803 --> 02:51.096
Miyuki!

02:51.471 --> 02:54.683
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.018
I am a woman.

02:56.185 --> 02:59.061
And it's a waste
to spill food like that.

03:00.563 --> 03:02.773
Don't just gobble your bread.

03:02.940 --> 03:07.612
Eat it with love for the people
who made and brought it here.

03:07.904 --> 03:11.991
I hate that Bible-thumping.
You're just like Akiko.

03:12.283 --> 03:13.659
Who's Akiko?

03:15.328 --> 03:16.412
My old lady.

03:16.579 --> 03:17.371
Well!

03:17.705 --> 03:19.457
Don't call your mother that.

03:19.665 --> 03:21.876
Eat shit, you old fart.

03:22.126 --> 03:24.378
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

03:24.545 --> 03:26.380
That hurts! You old...

03:27.048 --> 03:28.591
..."bag lady."

03:28.841 --> 03:33.804
You peep pretty loud for a chick
that can't even find its own worms.

03:33.971 --> 03:37.308
Should a burden on society
like you be talking?

03:37.475 --> 03:41.479
You're a burden on us.
What does that make you?

03:42.522 --> 03:45.233
The kettle the pot's calling black!

03:46.817 --> 03:48.444
You mouthy brat!

03:49.320 --> 03:52.823
Can't you at least get along
at Christmas?

03:53.407 --> 03:56.452
Oh, yes...
Miyuki, I got you a present.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.123
They're gone!

04:01.290 --> 04:04.501
A whole set of
"World Literature for Children."

04:04.668 --> 04:07.087
Why would I need that?!

04:07.254 --> 04:09.005
Hana looked hard for those!

04:09.214 --> 04:13.218
Even a homeless teenage runaway
needs a Christmas present!

04:14.636 --> 04:16.721
I choose not to go home.

04:16.930 --> 04:20.350
Six months on the street
means you don't have a home.

04:20.559 --> 04:23.270
I can go home
any time I want to.

04:23.562 --> 04:27.023
It's the ones who say that
who never do.

04:27.232 --> 04:29.276
Speak for yourself,
you old geezer!

04:29.776 --> 04:32.612
What are you doing
to Dostoevsky?!

04:33.530 --> 04:36.992
I won't take that,
today of all days!

04:38.243 --> 04:41.454
Not even my father
ever hit me!

04:42.664 --> 04:45.292
So I'll do it for him!

04:49.129 --> 04:51.631
Grow up, will you?!

04:52.924 --> 04:54.134
Don't hurt yourselves.

04:54.926 --> 04:56.553
Show more respect, kid!

04:56.761 --> 04:58.305
I'm not a kid!

04:58.471 --> 05:00.974
With little tits like these?

05:01.141 --> 05:03.226
You filthy old pervert!
That's harassment!

05:03.476 --> 05:05.395
Will you two stop!

05:08.523 --> 05:09.399
Huh?

05:28.959 --> 05:30.377
It's been...

05:30.628 --> 05:31.921
...abandoned.

05:32.630 --> 05:34.632
There, there, there.

05:37.635 --> 05:39.762
Care for this child.

05:42.223 --> 05:43.933
What a world!

05:44.642 --> 05:45.351
Oh, man!

05:45.518 --> 05:49.939
Oh, my! You're a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.

05:50.105 --> 05:51.732
"John Doe."

05:51.899 --> 05:54.068
She's a girl, I said!
He's so rude!

05:54.902 --> 06:00.449
How old was I when I started
living like this? Thirty-something?

06:02.451 --> 06:06.413
I still thought
that I was better off...

06:07.206 --> 06:09.083
...than a child with no home.

06:16.799 --> 06:21.135
There, there, now! We'll take you
somewhere warm.

06:23.555 --> 06:26.057
The cop shop's that way!

06:27.851 --> 06:30.395
This is a Christmas present
from God!

06:30.562 --> 06:33.231
She's our baby!

06:33.523 --> 06:34.399
Huh?

07:25.074 --> 07:26.450
Sorry!

07:26.867 --> 07:29.786
What do you mean,
take her with us?

07:30.078 --> 07:32.539
I'm just doing God's will.

07:32.831 --> 07:34.708
Her parents might come back.

07:35.042 --> 07:38.462
What parent would leave
a child out in this cold?!

07:38.670 --> 07:41.340
That's a devil, not a parent!

07:44.259 --> 07:47.638
Kiyoko wanted us
to find her.

07:47.804 --> 07:48.931
"Kiyoko"?

07:49.139 --> 07:51.642
"Kiyoko"? Why "Kiyoko"?!

07:52.100 --> 07:55.979
From kiyo, "pure",
on this purest of nights.

07:56.605 --> 07:57.481
How tacky!

07:57.648 --> 07:59.816
Kiyoko's a fine name!

07:59.983 --> 08:02.319
Did you have
a girlfriend named that?

08:02.486 --> 08:03.820
Idiot!

08:04.196 --> 08:08.992
Look, we can't just name her!
She's not a puppy or a kitten!

08:09.159 --> 08:10.661
So I'm taking her home.

08:10.827 --> 08:12.162
To a cardboard box?

08:12.329 --> 08:13.997
There's no room!

08:14.248 --> 08:19.336
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!

08:22.464 --> 08:24.049
A haiku:

08:24.675 --> 08:30.931
"A little baby / powdery snow
on its cheeks / on this holy night."

08:31.098 --> 08:35.017
Directed by
Satoshi Kon

08:46.988 --> 08:48.614
Peek-a-boo!

08:50.575 --> 08:52.869
Oh, dear! Tell me what's wrong!

08:53.035 --> 08:54.620
Shut up!

08:58.875 --> 08:59.458
Hey!

08:59.667 --> 09:04.255
I know, I know, he's not your mommy.
He's just a homeless homo.

09:04.547 --> 09:07.133
Don't say that
in front of her!

09:07.341 --> 09:11.012
A baby crying around here
will sound weird!

09:11.345 --> 09:14.473
We're going to take you
to the police soon, okay?

09:14.682 --> 09:17.018
You're not going anywhere,
are you?

09:17.226 --> 09:19.854
Idiot! We're taking
her to the police!

09:20.062 --> 09:22.148
Don't shout
or she'll never shut up!

09:22.356 --> 09:25.735
Why won't you stop crying?
Are you hungry?

09:25.902 --> 09:26.819
There, there!

09:27.028 --> 09:29.447
Maybe she's sick.

09:43.168 --> 09:46.838
Tomorrow...
I promise I'll take her then.

09:48.006 --> 09:52.511
Christmas should be
the happiest day of the year.

09:52.719 --> 09:56.097
If we take her in now, it'll always be
the worst day of her life!

09:57.807 --> 09:58.892
Maybe...

09:59.643 --> 10:01.520
...she needs a diaper.

10:11.530 --> 10:13.114
Hana, boil some water.

10:13.573 --> 10:14.950
I'll make some milk.

10:15.242 --> 10:17.494
Hey! Whose side are you on?!

10:17.702 --> 10:22.123
Go buy some water!
My angel isn't drinking from the tap!

10:22.457 --> 10:24.125
Why me?

10:25.627 --> 10:30.131
Where does a bum get off telling me
"Them that works eats"?

10:32.008 --> 10:36.888
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.

10:39.266 --> 10:43.270
So "no man is an island"
after all, huh?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.525
You're buying water?!

10:50.442 --> 10:52.403
A Christmas miracle.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.030
What a haul!

11:01.620 --> 11:03.831
Watch where you're going, brat!

11:03.998 --> 11:05.833
You watch where you're going!

11:09.336 --> 11:11.964
I was married once.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.757
With a child?

11:13.924 --> 11:17.845
No, don't tell me!
I don't want to hear this!

11:19.430 --> 11:22.683
You never forget
for one second.

11:22.850 --> 11:27.271
A child's the only thing
you hold dearer than life itself.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.065
A boy?

11:30.524 --> 11:31.775
No.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.615
Bullshit!

11:37.781 --> 11:39.783
Come on! Give it back!

11:40.117 --> 11:44.371
Hey, you're the girl
who hangs out with Gin.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.207
Get out of here, will you?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.918
We don't want Gin after us.

11:50.252 --> 11:50.878
Why not?

11:51.045 --> 11:54.465
You're the light of his life,
that's why not!

11:55.007 --> 12:00.136
There's not much light
in a cardboard box.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.597
Let me have this book.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.143
How old?

12:07.310 --> 12:09.562
Twenty-one, I think.

12:10.021 --> 12:14.150
Five or six years older
than Miyuki, I guess.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.152
That old?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.738
If she was alive.

12:20.365 --> 12:24.953
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant,
and we got married.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.455
I was in heaven.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.668
You could have poked me in the eye
and I'd have just smiled at you.

12:31.876 --> 12:37.757
But my daughter got sick,
and the medical bills were huge.

12:37.966 --> 12:42.595
I was something of
a bicycle racer then.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.850
I needed money.
There was this race...

12:47.058 --> 12:48.268
You threw it?

12:50.728 --> 12:54.566
A punk I knew
had this scheme.

12:54.732 --> 13:00.613
They found out, I got kicked out
of racing, and my girl died.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.032
I just didn't feel
like working anymore.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.369
And then my wife
followed my daughter.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.620
Oh, no!

13:09.997 --> 13:12.499
That's how you get to be
a man like me.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.211
I didn't want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!

13:17.462 --> 13:19.590
It's freezing!

13:23.218 --> 13:24.469
You're used to this.

13:24.636 --> 13:25.846
Kind of.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.724
I'll give her the milk.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.560
Dreams do come true.

13:31.727 --> 13:36.481
I always dreamed of being
the mother of a little girl.

13:36.648 --> 13:38.901
A nice, warm house,
a pretty daughter.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.737
Even if my husband
was no good...

13:41.945 --> 13:44.907
...I would accept dire poverty
as long as I had my child.

13:45.073 --> 13:47.117
Feed the poor kid!

13:52.122 --> 13:53.999
You're so pretty.

13:54.791 --> 13:58.545
The prettiest little girl
in the world.

14:23.861 --> 14:25.071
What do you want?!

14:25.571 --> 14:26.864
They're gone.

14:30.159 --> 14:32.286
Santa Claus, maybe?

14:32.537 --> 14:35.623
"Uncle Bag" and the baby
are gone.

14:35.790 --> 14:38.584
What's that faggot
thinking about?!

14:41.379 --> 14:43.881
Man, he's got big feet!

14:44.048 --> 14:46.384
You can't have feet fixed.

15:03.442 --> 15:05.319
Are you taking her back?

15:06.737 --> 15:09.156
There's probably an APB
out on her.

15:09.532 --> 15:11.075
And for you.

15:11.242 --> 15:11.993
I doubt it.

15:13.035 --> 15:16.330
An arrest warrant, maybe.

15:17.706 --> 15:20.834
Her parents are probably
sorry about this now.

15:21.084 --> 15:23.378
So let's take her to the police.

15:24.129 --> 15:28.341
A baby's always
better off with its real mother.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.343
Not necessarily.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.806
Sometimes a
foster mother's better.

15:35.015 --> 15:37.350
- What?!
- Don't be stupid.

15:38.143 --> 15:41.354
I never knew
my real mother.

15:43.356 --> 15:47.986
But I'll bet if she saw me now,
she'd flip.

15:49.321 --> 15:52.199
How can someone homeless
raise a child?

15:52.365 --> 15:54.868
I know, I know!

15:55.911 --> 15:59.623
I don't want her shunted
from one foster home to another...

15:59.915 --> 16:02.083
...without even one memory...

16:02.292 --> 16:04.503
...of ever having been loved.

16:04.836 --> 16:08.215
You don't have to be a foundling
to feel that.

16:08.715 --> 16:10.884
They must have had reasons.

16:11.092 --> 16:13.887
Nothing should make you
abandon a child!

16:15.472 --> 16:20.477
That means you've taken love
and tossed it away, like trash.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.898
Yeah, but what can we
do about it?

16:25.606 --> 16:27.024
Find her mother.

16:29.235 --> 16:32.279
And ask why she abandoned
her baby.

16:33.656 --> 16:36.116
If she can make me understand...

16:36.992 --> 16:39.620
...I'll forgive her,
and my mother too.

16:40.454 --> 16:42.540
Find her?

16:42.748 --> 16:44.375
How?

16:48.462 --> 16:50.422
We'll have to pay again.

16:50.965 --> 16:54.093
This is an expensive year-end!

16:54.426 --> 16:56.554
What if we find another baby?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.265
They don't toss them out in twos.

17:10.483 --> 17:12.278
Another key!

17:12.486 --> 17:16.448
Look at these panties.
You'd catch cold in them!

17:17.116 --> 17:19.660
Are they the ones?

17:23.164 --> 17:25.207
Are these your folks?

17:25.708 --> 17:27.542
Look, business cards.

17:35.008 --> 17:38.469
A hostess club
won't be open at this hour!

17:38.928 --> 17:41.306
We've got some walking to do.

17:41.472 --> 17:43.725
You've gotta be kidding!

17:47.020 --> 17:48.980
He was eating for two!

18:02.202 --> 18:07.832
But why pack like you're off on a trip
and then abandon a baby?

18:08.374 --> 18:11.628
Maybe it was one last trip
they were taking.

18:11.794 --> 18:12.962
A family suicide?!

18:14.589 --> 18:15.924
Then what do we do?

18:16.424 --> 18:18.551
We can't search the next world!

18:18.760 --> 18:20.220
Shh!

18:26.351 --> 18:29.395
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

18:29.562 --> 18:34.150
Trains will be delayed due
to heavy snowfall.

18:34.901 --> 18:36.402
It's so hot in here!

18:36.611 --> 18:38.321
What a stink!

18:38.947 --> 18:41.865
Have you bathed lately?

18:42.574 --> 18:44.451
No. Or washed my clothes.

18:44.618 --> 18:46.328
How embarrassing!

18:56.296 --> 18:58.257
Oh, dear! There, there.

18:58.423 --> 19:01.760
Did she piss herself?
That's why it stinks!

19:01.927 --> 19:03.637
It's you that stinks!

19:03.887 --> 19:04.847
Quiet!

19:05.055 --> 19:06.890
Shut that kid up!

19:21.572 --> 19:22.865
Watch it!

19:23.740 --> 19:24.449
Hey!

19:33.834 --> 19:35.043
Miyuki!

19:35.252 --> 19:36.879
What's she up to?

19:43.468 --> 19:45.888
We wasted our train fares!

19:46.471 --> 19:48.806
It was me who paid them.

19:50.266 --> 19:53.895
I'm sorry!
There's no more milk.

19:54.145 --> 19:56.480
Go ahead, blame it all on me.

19:56.689 --> 19:59.859
Oh, cheer up!
Let's sing a song.

20:04.780 --> 20:05.740
What's that?

20:05.907 --> 20:07.491
The Sound of Music,
of course.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.701
Never heard of it.

20:16.959 --> 20:20.296
That's going to make you
even hungrier.

20:29.388 --> 20:31.140
I'm starving!

20:31.807 --> 20:33.768
I told you!

20:34.227 --> 20:36.771
Look after my little angel.

20:38.105 --> 20:39.649
Go on without me.

20:39.982 --> 20:44.278
Just say you'll never forget
the queer you once knew.

20:44.737 --> 20:47.114
Look.
A cemetery.

20:47.281 --> 20:49.200
I'm not dead yet!

21:02.045 --> 21:04.923
Now I'm alive again!

21:06.007 --> 21:10.887
But there's nothing for a baby
in these offerings to the dead!

21:11.054 --> 21:13.056
We'll get by!

21:13.515 --> 21:16.142
Yeah, sure! "We'll get by!"

21:16.351 --> 21:19.521
People keep on saying that
till they end up living like us!

21:19.855 --> 21:25.527
And while we keep on saying it,
the kid'll end up under a stone here.

21:25.694 --> 21:27.404
"Kiyoko"! She has a name!

21:27.571 --> 21:32.409
Yeah, whatever. And she's cute.
She's so pretty.

21:32.826 --> 21:35.412
But listen to me. I'm serious.

21:35.954 --> 21:37.164
You listening?

21:38.373 --> 21:41.835
If you really care
about that kid...

21:42.043 --> 21:45.088
...you'll find her someone
to take care of her.

21:45.297 --> 21:47.674
I speak from experience.

21:47.924 --> 21:50.051
That's what her parents said, I bet.

21:50.218 --> 21:53.847
What do you mean?
I wouldn't abandon a kid.

21:54.139 --> 21:56.391
Don't be stupid!

21:56.558 --> 21:59.519
No. Your family
abandoned you!

22:00.103 --> 22:03.522
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...

22:03.731 --> 22:06.650
...while some dumb faggot
pisses on me?

22:06.817 --> 22:10.779
What are we doing here?
Tell me.

22:10.988 --> 22:12.823
Wracking our brains!

22:12.990 --> 22:16.285
We're scavenging offerings
left in a cemetery.

22:16.452 --> 22:19.246
And why? Because
we're homeless.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.416
- Stop it!
- No! I'm not going to stop.

22:22.666 --> 22:25.544
We are three
good-for-nothing bums...

22:25.753 --> 22:28.130
...who can't even
look after ourselves.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.466
Shut up! I'm thinking!

22:30.841 --> 22:32.593
I won't shut up.

22:32.843 --> 22:37.973
You can't get milk from an old queer's
tits, no matter how hard you think.

22:38.265 --> 22:42.561
Come on, Hana! You know
we can't do this.

22:42.853 --> 22:44.396
Speak for yourself!

22:44.813 --> 22:47.775
This way the whole family
will be dead.

22:56.617 --> 22:58.452
Oh, my!

22:59.662 --> 23:02.122
You're so lucky, Kiyoko!

23:02.289 --> 23:04.458
God must really love you!

23:05.501 --> 23:06.919
Then why was she...

23:07.086 --> 23:08.462
...dumped?

23:09.504 --> 23:10.964
Left!

23:11.130 --> 23:15.134
- That's a dead end!
- It's right!

23:18.054 --> 23:19.931
- Tails.
- Heads.

23:29.023 --> 23:32.026
What's this guy doing
parking like that?

23:32.193 --> 23:35.321
Doesn't he know what
a "public thoroughfare" is?

23:55.925 --> 23:57.468
How did that happen?

23:57.677 --> 24:03.600
Bad luck. The car got stuck,
and I forgot the parking brake.

24:03.766 --> 24:05.977
Then someone shouted,
"Dorothy, wait!"...

24:06.186 --> 24:07.979
...and then I heard, "Whoops!"...

24:08.521 --> 24:12.108
...and the damn car
rolled on top of me.

24:13.359 --> 24:19.364
I don't bring my men with me
when I'm visiting the old man's grave.

24:19.907 --> 24:23.660
I owe you. Call me
if you're ever in trouble.

24:23.911 --> 24:26.079
Oh, no, we never have
any trouble.

24:26.288 --> 24:28.332
You're from Kinshicho?

24:28.499 --> 24:31.168
We were just going there.

24:31.335 --> 24:33.629
I know it's rude to ask...

24:33.795 --> 24:35.839
If it's rude, then don't ask.

24:36.048 --> 24:37.508
Come on.

24:38.884 --> 24:41.678
Would you know
this establishment?

24:41.887 --> 24:43.222
Club Swirl: "Midori"

24:44.431 --> 24:46.099
Know it?

24:46.934 --> 24:51.104
Its owner's marrying
my daughter today.

24:52.439 --> 24:57.194
He's one of my men,
but he's too cocky.

24:57.402 --> 24:59.738
I was against it.

24:59.905 --> 25:02.074
But your daughter chose him.

25:02.407 --> 25:06.078
The daughter I brought up,
married to a man like that...

25:07.663 --> 25:08.789
Know what I mean?

25:09.665 --> 25:14.002
But if your daughter's
happy with him...

25:14.169 --> 25:16.046
...isn't that the main thing?

25:16.213 --> 25:17.214
You're right!

25:17.422 --> 25:24.428
I went to the old man's grave
so I wouldn't cry at the wedding.

25:24.679 --> 25:26.430
Watch the road!

25:32.103 --> 25:33.646
Good evening, sir!

25:35.690 --> 25:37.608
Make yourselves at home.

25:50.621 --> 25:52.331
Daddy, you're late!

25:52.540 --> 25:56.419
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.

25:56.586 --> 25:59.547
I owe them my life.

25:59.714 --> 26:01.215
My daughter, Kiyoko.

26:01.382 --> 26:02.633
Oh. Hello.

26:13.186 --> 26:16.063
What have you gotten us into?!

26:16.230 --> 26:18.524
Just shut up and eat!

26:22.153 --> 26:24.906
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.

26:33.246 --> 26:37.584
Don't you think Kiyoko
has amazing luck?

26:40.086 --> 26:41.129
Yeah.

26:41.838 --> 26:43.798
Maybe she does.

26:47.260 --> 26:49.971
Oh, yeah. Her name's Sachiko.

26:50.514 --> 26:51.806
Not "Midori"?

26:51.973 --> 26:53.517
Just at the club.

26:53.683 --> 26:56.478
She's Sachiko, "happy child,"
though she didn't look it.

26:56.645 --> 27:01.650
But some plastic surgery
turned her into a good little earner.

27:03.276 --> 27:05.987
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.

27:06.196 --> 27:08.156
Do you know where she is?

27:09.032 --> 27:11.576
I doubt you'll wring
any money out of her.

27:12.285 --> 27:15.080
No, I have something
to give her.

27:18.917 --> 27:22.379
I'm sorry
I spilled your food.

27:22.754 --> 27:26.007
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.

27:27.884 --> 27:30.011
She said her husband
was in debt.

27:30.178 --> 27:32.264
What's wrong with you?

27:32.430 --> 27:33.682
That bastard.

27:33.890 --> 27:36.059
Do you know him?

27:36.643 --> 27:38.520
Then she borrowed
more money from us...

27:38.812 --> 27:41.814
...and ended up screwed both ways.

27:42.106 --> 27:44.066
You know where she is?

27:44.942 --> 27:45.609
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

27:45.610 --> 27:48.445
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

27:48.612 --> 27:51.365
...l'd still be with
my wife and kid!

27:51.574 --> 27:54.118
But aren't they both dead?

27:54.285 --> 27:56.453
I'll kill the bastard!

27:57.496 --> 27:59.623
You'll get killed!

28:26.525 --> 28:27.860
Mitsuo! Mitsuo!

28:28.027 --> 28:30.321
It was that maid!

28:30.488 --> 28:32.364
Are you okay?!

28:33.449 --> 28:34.783
She's got a gun!

28:36.452 --> 28:37.495
Hey, what?!

28:42.500 --> 28:44.335
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

28:45.461 --> 28:46.419
Hey!

29:08.358 --> 29:11.152
Thank you very much.

29:11.986 --> 29:14.364
She's got a gun, you know!

29:14.531 --> 29:17.992
- Our lives are already wasted!
- Hana!

29:23.665 --> 29:24.374
There!

29:49.941 --> 29:54.278
Yes! One of your cabs picked up
a young woman with a baby.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.364
Number 12-25. Send it to...

29:58.532 --> 30:01.451
...the Tokyo Tower.
My name is

30:03.871 --> 30:06.582
Hey! Wait a minute.

30:10.711 --> 30:15.591
We're homeless bums,
not action-movie heroes.

30:16.049 --> 30:18.051
What we need now
is the police.

30:19.094 --> 30:24.016
If you like the police so much,
get them to adopt you!

30:24.183 --> 30:26.894
Those children are like family!

30:27.060 --> 30:29.062
I thought I could
depend on you!

30:29.396 --> 30:32.774
Don't talk like you were
my damn wife.

30:35.068 --> 30:36.612
I'm not going anywhere.

30:36.820 --> 30:37.946
Gin!

30:38.447 --> 30:40.532
We've done all we could.

30:40.741 --> 30:41.867
You're giving up?

30:42.910 --> 30:45.704
There's nothing we can do.

30:46.246 --> 30:48.916
You are really
the lowest of the low!

30:49.082 --> 30:52.211
The best thing you'll ever do
is die in the gutter!

30:52.377 --> 30:56.048
Oh, poor you! You'll be dead
and no one'll care!

30:56.256 --> 30:59.134
All you ever do is
cause people trouble!

30:59.301 --> 31:01.886
Dead or alive, you're living trash!

31:02.053 --> 31:04.764
The king of trash!

31:08.935 --> 31:13.314
Okay, so I'm trash.
But you're ugly.

31:29.038 --> 31:32.792
- Yes?
- I want to get rid of some trash.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.550
I don't think I'd fit.

31:41.384 --> 31:46.305
Yeah, that's what I am,
living trash!

31:47.890 --> 31:52.144
Who cares if you die
in the gutter?

31:53.396 --> 31:56.983
You're dead all the same.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.131
You okay?

32:21.923 --> 32:24.259
Hang in there, Gramps.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.056
- May I make one last request?
- What?

32:31.892 --> 32:34.060
Give me a drink of that.

33:24.777 --> 33:27.404
You're not selling me
into slavery!

33:29.406 --> 33:31.534
Somebody, help!

33:45.756 --> 33:49.885
I always wanted to die drunk,
in a nice old house.

33:50.052 --> 33:53.097
Now I'm halfway there.

33:53.347 --> 33:55.474
Fate works in strange ways.

33:56.475 --> 33:59.270
I've lived a long time...

33:59.436 --> 34:03.023
...but I'm just trash,
as worthless dead as alive.

34:03.357 --> 34:05.484
Don't talk like that!

34:06.318 --> 34:10.489
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

34:11.031 --> 34:13.492
Looking at you now...

34:13.868 --> 34:16.996
...may I make a last request?

34:17.705 --> 34:20.583
Get rid of this for me.

34:20.875 --> 34:26.504
Some people will be hurt
if it's known who I am.

34:26.713 --> 34:30.341
Okay. I understand.
No one will ever know.

34:44.230 --> 34:48.568
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?

34:49.360 --> 34:50.527
Request?

34:56.242 --> 34:58.953
And now, goodbye.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.345
That's it!

35:18.515 --> 35:20.308
Thanks, Gramps!

35:26.064 --> 35:28.900
Time for the New Year's clean-up!

35:37.241 --> 35:39.117
Big breasts... Cool!

35:51.797 --> 35:54.174
Husband?

36:09.148 --> 36:10.399
Father

36:11.233 --> 36:12.234
Police.

36:12.401 --> 36:14.236
Your dad's a cop?!

36:14.486 --> 36:15.946
My father was a policeman!

36:16.363 --> 36:17.823
Father, policeman?

36:20.325 --> 36:25.831
Except I'm the one
he's going to be arresting.

36:40.595 --> 36:41.804
Hold it.

36:45.099 --> 36:47.435
Hi! How've you been?

36:50.021 --> 36:51.856
Now? Just cleaning up.

36:52.148 --> 36:54.317
Hey, wake up!

36:54.484 --> 36:55.568
Come on!

36:59.030 --> 37:01.073
No! Not that!

37:02.325 --> 37:03.993
Time to die, old man!

37:04.160 --> 37:07.330
Kiyo's coming? I'm there!

37:07.997 --> 37:10.166
The girls are drinking near here.

37:10.374 --> 37:11.918
Yeah?

37:13.336 --> 37:15.338
All cleaned up.

37:19.717 --> 37:20.927
Give it back!

37:22.220 --> 37:24.430
Give me that back!

37:25.890 --> 37:30.645
Her foreigner husband looked like
he was in a real bad mood.

37:31.395 --> 37:32.605
Did he hit her?

37:32.772 --> 37:36.108
No, she was being real nice
for a girl so young.

37:36.317 --> 37:39.529
My wife could learn something!

37:40.530 --> 37:43.950
His foreign assailant fled, taking
a young woman and a baby hostage.

37:44.116 --> 37:48.995
With the groom in serious condition,
police speculate this may be a war...

37:49.329 --> 37:51.540
...between crime syndicates.

37:51.998 --> 37:54.835
Hey, this is serious!

37:55.001 --> 37:57.045
I'm not kidding around, either!

38:03.718 --> 38:05.595
My mom's religious.

38:05.762 --> 38:07.889
She chants all the time.

38:13.937 --> 38:14.938
Me.

38:19.526 --> 38:21.111
Isn't she cute?

38:21.528 --> 38:24.823
I found her. Those spots
on her back look like wings.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.616
So I called her "Angel."

38:28.368 --> 38:30.537
But she's gone.

38:33.623 --> 38:34.833
Father.

38:45.510 --> 38:47.387
I stabbed my father.

38:47.846 --> 38:50.140
I can never go back.

39:16.624 --> 39:19.418
The baby? A gift from God.

39:19.585 --> 39:20.461
Yes.

39:21.587 --> 39:24.006
Give me a break!

39:24.256 --> 39:26.091
I've got a family at home!

39:26.258 --> 39:28.677
Those children are my family!

39:30.304 --> 39:31.972
They went in there.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.516
Hey! The fare!

39:33.682 --> 39:34.975
I'll be right back.

39:35.267 --> 39:37.520
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

39:38.813 --> 39:40.773
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

39:40.940 --> 39:42.608
Where are you?

39:49.824 --> 39:52.701
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

40:09.467 --> 40:11.928
How could you do this to me?!

40:13.513 --> 40:14.889
It's your own fault!

40:15.765 --> 40:18.810
You never listen
to anything I say!

40:18.977 --> 40:21.020
Use the scarf I made you...

40:21.229 --> 40:22.981
...to mop up the blood!

40:23.148 --> 40:24.524
What have you done
with Angel?!

40:24.732 --> 40:27.443
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?

40:28.069 --> 40:29.487
She's right here.

40:29.779 --> 40:31.197
Our angel.

40:33.491 --> 40:35.243
I'm hungry.

40:35.493 --> 40:36.911
Make me some food.

40:38.163 --> 40:38.997
Why?

40:39.622 --> 40:41.916
What are you doing in my house?

40:42.083 --> 40:46.254
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I'll get dinner.

40:56.639 --> 41:01.436
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

41:06.441 --> 41:07.774
Uncle Bag?!

41:11.612 --> 41:15.199
Oh, I've missed you,
my little angel!

41:18.952 --> 41:22.706
I wish I was her mother,
but I'm just another homo.

41:24.041 --> 41:24.833
Miyuki...

41:26.418 --> 41:28.170
...I'm so glad you're safe.

41:37.554 --> 41:38.347
Where's the geezer?

41:39.348 --> 41:41.850
He could be dead
for all I care!

41:44.478 --> 41:46.980
I'm dying.

41:56.824 --> 41:59.201
Maybe he went home.

41:59.368 --> 42:00.619
Who cares?

42:00.994 --> 42:03.288
All he thinks about
is himself.

42:04.706 --> 42:09.461
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you're
in love with him, aren't you?

42:09.670 --> 42:13.549
Don't be silly! I like my men
to be more "manly."

42:13.715 --> 42:19.178
The kind of man I like is
slender, middle-aged, tanned...

42:19.345 --> 42:22.807
...with a divine square-back haircut
and a lower-town accent...

42:23.015 --> 42:26.018
...who says, "Ah, what the hell"...

42:26.185 --> 42:29.397
...when I don't quite have
the cab fare.

42:32.692 --> 42:35.111
So, what now, Miss Hana?

42:35.278 --> 42:39.490
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.

42:39.699 --> 42:41.868
It's hard to say.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.376
I'm glad.

42:53.421 --> 42:54.505
He just died there?

42:54.714 --> 42:56.090
He was homeless.

42:56.257 --> 42:57.717
I might be next.

42:57.884 --> 42:59.051
Just do your job.

42:59.218 --> 43:01.262
Gin!

43:03.973 --> 43:06.392
Gin! Gin!

43:07.059 --> 43:08.603
Take it easy.

43:08.769 --> 43:09.729
Gin!

43:09.896 --> 43:11.439
Calm down!

43:19.947 --> 43:23.658
Where is that man of mine?!

43:24.784 --> 43:29.372
Kiyo...

43:30.415 --> 43:35.045
If only tonight...

43:36.463 --> 43:40.675
...I wanted to see you
before I died.

43:43.261 --> 43:45.889
Kiyoko!

44:01.571 --> 44:05.283
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?

44:06.243 --> 44:09.287
- An ambulance.
- Well! Aren't you rude!

44:10.497 --> 44:14.793
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can't sleep out on the street!

44:14.960 --> 44:19.089
The geezer's not here,
we're freezing, sleepy, hungry.

44:19.297 --> 44:20.799
This sucks!

44:21.466 --> 44:24.094
I guess there's no choice.

44:29.849 --> 44:32.393
I never thought
I'd be here again.

44:38.649 --> 44:42.987
I'm sorry. We're closed for
a private party tonight

44:45.156 --> 44:46.448
Hana?!

44:46.866 --> 44:50.870
I know I have no right
to come strolling in now...

44:51.036 --> 44:54.915
...but there's no one else
I can call on, "Mother"!

44:59.545 --> 45:01.130
Hana!

45:01.881 --> 45:03.132
Mother!

45:03.340 --> 45:04.675
Hana!

45:12.391 --> 45:13.350
Geezer?!

45:16.645 --> 45:18.522
What happened, Gin?!

45:20.900 --> 45:23.486
Some kids beat me up.

45:24.445 --> 45:27.406
I guess I'm just not
an action hero.

45:31.785 --> 45:34.413
He said he knew you.

45:34.747 --> 45:37.832
But he said he was homeless,
you know.

45:38.875 --> 45:40.251
So am I.

45:40.418 --> 45:44.088
What? But why?!

45:45.381 --> 45:47.634
Since Ken died I'm like a canary...

45:47.800 --> 45:50.094
...that's forgotten its song.

45:50.553 --> 45:52.806
You sing all the time!

45:54.182 --> 45:55.558
Isn't she cute?!

45:55.725 --> 45:57.310
I wish I could have one!

46:02.690 --> 46:06.194
So Ken died, did he?

46:08.404 --> 46:09.656
AIDS?

46:10.365 --> 46:12.575
He slipped on the soap.

46:12.742 --> 46:16.704
Well, death is always
a hair's breadth away.

46:17.247 --> 46:21.334
But if you were in trouble,
why didn't you come back?

46:24.087 --> 46:27.507
We certainly had fun here,
didn't we?

46:29.300 --> 46:31.761
In this old bar

46:32.011 --> 46:35.557
I've had so much to drink

46:36.474 --> 46:38.560
My old memories

46:39.185 --> 46:43.523
All start to blur

46:43.773 --> 46:46.191
My lover

46:46.358 --> 46:49.653
Has left me

46:50.946 --> 46:56.118
People call me notorious

46:56.285 --> 46:58.120
Aw, you're ugly!

46:58.620 --> 47:01.039
Good for nothing

47:01.206 --> 47:02.040
Get off!

47:02.207 --> 47:04.918
Good for nothing

47:05.919 --> 47:09.590
What a terrible thing to say

47:09.798 --> 47:12.217
Eat shit, you old fart!

47:13.844 --> 47:17.931
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

47:24.938 --> 47:28.108
I couldn't come back
after I'd done that.

47:28.525 --> 47:32.404
A little bit of money
took care of that.

47:32.571 --> 47:35.365
I'm just happy you're all right.

47:37.534 --> 47:41.246
Stop it! You scare me
when you start crying.

47:42.998 --> 47:47.169
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?

47:47.336 --> 47:48.587
Well...

47:52.006 --> 47:55.510
Where is your mother, anyway?

47:56.552 --> 47:57.678
Abandoned?!

47:57.845 --> 48:01.265
Yes! I've been abandoned!

48:03.768 --> 48:06.437
Them's the breaks, I guess.

48:07.855 --> 48:10.358
I could see me in her.

48:10.608 --> 48:14.821
Born on the street,
and back there again.

48:15.279 --> 48:20.952
That's why I want to find her
a home full of love!

48:21.118 --> 48:25.540
All I ever wanted was love!

48:32.672 --> 48:33.548
Ow!

48:40.179 --> 48:42.056
What the hell?!

48:44.684 --> 48:47.186
The geezer's come out.

48:47.395 --> 48:48.729
Where are my clothes?!

48:58.573 --> 49:00.407
Way to go, Gin!

49:02.200 --> 49:04.411
Come back any time.

49:05.537 --> 49:07.956
Thank you, Mother.

49:11.001 --> 49:17.549
My mother's white breath / as she
watches me set out / on a long journey.

50:33.290 --> 50:35.709
Oh, man!

50:36.085 --> 50:39.630
An empty building's always nice,
but look who got here first.

50:43.175 --> 50:46.720
I'd just love to fill up
on some meat!

50:47.346 --> 50:49.181
Don't you dare!

50:50.850 --> 50:53.352
Just kidding!

50:58.023 --> 51:01.527
The snow's let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?

51:01.694 --> 51:02.695
Okay.

51:02.862 --> 51:05.072
Get me some sake.

51:05.698 --> 51:07.408
Just one.

51:25.425 --> 51:27.719
- No!
- I wish.

51:44.903 --> 51:46.237
"Honey, I'm home."

52:04.172 --> 52:10.178
You stayed in there?
You'd think you were homeless!

52:14.641 --> 52:17.977
Actually, we're looking for
these people.

52:19.479 --> 52:21.730
Sachiko Nishizawa.

52:22.189 --> 52:23.440
Do you know her?

52:23.941 --> 52:27.653
She never paid me back for her
Neighborhood Association dues.

52:27.820 --> 52:30.155
Are you a relative?

52:30.322 --> 52:34.868
No! We're acquaintances
of a relative.

52:35.244 --> 52:37.454
Her husband was no better.

52:37.621 --> 52:42.084
Gambling day and night,
and mean when he drank.

52:44.127 --> 52:47.256
Living on his wife's earnings
and borrowed money.

52:47.464 --> 52:49.216
Where are they now?

52:49.383 --> 52:53.011
I wouldn't know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.

52:53.554 --> 52:57.015
They left
about three months ago.

52:57.975 --> 53:04.481
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.

53:05.315 --> 53:08.443
They were a nice couple
at first...

53:08.652 --> 53:12.573
...but it wasn't long before
they started fighting.

53:12.739 --> 53:14.741
That's poverty for you.

53:14.908 --> 53:19.204
All that debt didn't stop him
from lording it over her.

53:19.371 --> 53:22.958
Even the most dedicated wife
has her limits.

53:24.084 --> 53:26.128
You'd see bruises sometimes.

53:26.336 --> 53:28.088
The poor woman.

53:28.255 --> 53:30.798
Not on her, on him!

53:31.007 --> 53:32.175
Oh, dear!

53:32.884 --> 53:39.640
But his mother would always take
his side against her.

53:40.725 --> 53:43.519
His parents built them this house.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.605
Where do they live?

53:45.771 --> 53:48.024
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.

53:50.193 --> 53:52.487
Her mother-in-law
was always complaining...

53:52.695 --> 53:54.822
...that she never did
any housework.

53:55.031 --> 53:57.241
But her son was perfect,
of course.

53:57.408 --> 54:00.077
Of course!
That's why I told her...

54:00.244 --> 54:04.332
...she'd never see a grandchild
with his wife working in a club.

54:04.874 --> 54:07.668
But she did get pregnant.

54:07.877 --> 54:10.129
Well, a man and a woman...

54:10.296 --> 54:11.881
They can always find time...

54:12.048 --> 54:14.175
...to do what they must!

54:14.383 --> 54:17.845
Shinkocho 1-2-25
Maison Happiness Apt. 203

54:19.138 --> 54:21.474
What if they ran out
from this new place too?

54:21.641 --> 54:24.060
What a horrible man!

54:24.310 --> 54:29.524
Poor Sachiko! Working to pay off
her husband's gambling debts!

54:29.732 --> 54:30.942
Right!

54:31.275 --> 54:35.738
But I never thought of
abandoning the kid!

54:36.113 --> 54:38.281
- Huh?
- Nothing.

54:38.448 --> 54:42.536
That's no reason
to just dump the kid!

54:42.744 --> 54:44.371
I've said that all along.

54:47.541 --> 54:51.920
Miyuki: Angel has
come home. Dad.

54:56.424 --> 54:59.344
Doesn't it ever get tired
of snowing?

55:01.847 --> 55:03.765
Thank you.

55:13.358 --> 55:16.778
I wonder how we look
to them.

55:16.945 --> 55:19.614
Like a bum, a homo,
a runaway and a foundling.

55:20.115 --> 55:23.577
Kiyoko is God's messenger.
We're her servants.

55:24.786 --> 55:27.122
Unpaid servants.

55:27.414 --> 55:30.542
Paying for a father's sins.

55:30.709 --> 55:33.920
Yeah, if her father had been
any good at all...

55:34.129 --> 55:36.465
...we wouldn't be going
through all this.

55:38.133 --> 55:43.263
Even a good-for-nothing father
never forgets a child.

55:45.347 --> 55:46.849
I'm going out.

55:51.312 --> 55:53.981
What's the matter with her?

55:54.148 --> 55:57.651
A child never forgets
its parents.

56:02.323 --> 56:05.326
I never stop wanting...

56:06.494 --> 56:09.121
...to see my daughter, just once.

56:09.330 --> 56:11.373
So she's alive?

56:11.749 --> 56:12.917
Yeah.

56:13.083 --> 56:14.251
And your wife?

56:15.544 --> 56:17.755
I'm sure she's remarried...

56:18.339 --> 56:20.633
...and living happily.

56:25.638 --> 56:26.722
"Hello.

56:27.264 --> 56:28.891
It's me, Miyuki."

56:29.642 --> 56:31.602
Why did you split up?

56:31.852 --> 56:33.938
- Drinking and gambling.
- What?!

56:35.189 --> 56:36.524
Just like...

56:37.608 --> 56:39.902
I'm a louse.

56:41.028 --> 56:46.158
But I've always wanted to do
something for her as a father...

56:46.408 --> 56:47.910
...even just a little.

56:48.786 --> 56:52.413
When I was gambling
this would have been nothing.

56:52.831 --> 56:56.334
Now I've had to sweat blood
just to save 30,000 yen.

56:56.543 --> 56:58.670
That's great, Gin!

56:59.045 --> 57:00.672
We can stuff ourselves!

57:00.880 --> 57:02.382
Stuff you!

57:12.100 --> 57:13.434
Ishida speaking.

57:22.235 --> 57:25.363
Miyuki? Is that you?

57:27.699 --> 57:28.867
Are you all right?

57:34.873 --> 57:36.332
I'm sorry!

57:36.499 --> 57:38.126
I'm sorry!

57:38.751 --> 57:40.545
I'm sorry!

57:42.755 --> 57:45.258
Excuse me,
but if you wouldn't mind...

57:45.425 --> 57:47.051
"Get out", you mean?

57:47.427 --> 57:50.930
Other customers
might like to sit down.

57:51.181 --> 57:52.599
There's hardly anyone here!

57:52.765 --> 57:54.392
You guys stink!

57:55.143 --> 57:58.729
What are you?
Homeless or something?

57:59.354 --> 58:03.400
Does trash have kids too?
Just like real people?

58:04.109 --> 58:06.236
Who are you looking at?

58:08.447 --> 58:09.740
Hold it, you!

58:10.616 --> 58:12.117
Sir! No!

58:12.284 --> 58:14.286
Hold it, I said, you low-life!

58:24.338 --> 58:27.800
It's New Year's Sale time
at The Food Store!

58:28.133 --> 58:34.515
Come to The Food Store
for all your special New Year's needs!

58:34.681 --> 58:37.351
See in the New Year
with your family!

58:37.518 --> 58:39.311
Call an ambulance, quick.

58:40.062 --> 58:41.438
Right!

58:44.650 --> 58:49.363
I knew it! Kiyoko really is
the messenger of God!

58:51.990 --> 58:52.324
Hey!

58:53.325 --> 58:53.826
Miss Hana!

58:53.992 --> 58:55.410
Hey!

58:55.577 --> 58:56.620
Hana!

59:13.010 --> 59:15.721
Following a recent
gangland shooting incident...

59:15.888 --> 59:21.477
...police are seeking a fugitive
thought to be Latin American.

59:22.103 --> 59:24.814
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...

59:24.981 --> 59:28.818
...in protecting the leader
of his syndicate...

59:29.110 --> 59:34.365
...will be questioned after he recovers
from his wounds.

59:35.241 --> 59:38.828
Isn't she cute!
When was she born?

59:39.036 --> 59:41.998
Not long ago, I guess.

59:42.415 --> 59:43.916
So the mother...

59:44.083 --> 59:45.668
I'm not.

59:46.210 --> 59:48.004
What's her name?

59:48.171 --> 59:48.588
Kiyoko.

59:48.754 --> 59:52.675
That's my name too.
What a coincidence.

59:55.386 --> 59:57.680
Your friend is very weak.

59:57.889 --> 01:00:00.766
Make sure he gets rest
and proper nutrition.

01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:02.185
Doctor!

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.521
Believe it or not,
we're homeless.

01:00:05.688 --> 01:00:07.899
I'm just a doctor.

01:00:09.317 --> 01:00:14.863
Rest and nutrition don't fit
with our lifestyle, you realize.

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:21.912
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:25.373
All anyone can do is their best.

01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:29.544
Take care.

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:36.218
The bill for today is 29,830 yen.

01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:40.597
Bring your health-insurance card
and you'll get a refund.

01:00:41.765 --> 01:00:44.226
I'm sorry, Gin!

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:48.563
Stop crying! You'll get
the bills all wet.

01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:51.274
That's 30,000 yen.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.834
Kiyoko?!

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.923
Dad?

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.947
So you took up nursing.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.450
I see.

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:47.705
I'm glad you're well.

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:53.294
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
How's your mother?

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:54.712
Fine.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.798
Yeah? That's good.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.134
What are you doing now?

01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:06.557
I'm in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.

01:02:10.603 --> 01:02:12.313
You must hate me.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:17.860
I was never any kind
of a father to you.

01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:24.158
But that 30,000 yen was money
I'd saved up for you.

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:27.161
You may not believe it.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.833
I always wanted to see you.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.255
When I was little,
Mom and I searched for you.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.175
We even checked
unidentified corpses.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:47.514
After you disappeared,
Mom ran the store herself.

01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:49.724
The store?

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:54.062
It was hard for a woman to run
a bicycle shop alone.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.066
That's not quite the same as
a bicycle racer.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:04.447
The man you owed money to was shot
and wounded the other day, you know.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.032
He lived?!

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:09.118
That's a relief.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.246
I thought you'd say that.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:19.045
I ran up the debts, not him.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:25.218
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.555
I'm getting married.

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:32.142
Oh? That's good.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.560
To him.

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:38.147
Great! But isn't he
about my age?

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:42.568
He's been married.
His daughter got sick and died...

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.404
...and his wife followed her.

01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:52.411
That man makes me so mad!

01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:54.204
Aren't you moved?

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:57.916
Here's the address
and phone number.

01:03:58.083 --> 01:03:59.001
Yours?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.587
The old house is gone.

01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:04.131
Even if you can't now,
call me sometime.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.676
Kiyoko!

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.807
I've had about
all I can stand!

01:04:13.974 --> 01:04:14.766
Miss Hana?

01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:17.644
Telling us you were a racer!

01:04:18.645 --> 01:04:20.647
I was always at the track.

01:04:20.814 --> 01:04:22.149
Yeah, betting!

01:04:22.316 --> 01:04:26.612
And your debts snowballed
so you couldn't face your family...

01:04:26.778 --> 01:04:28.655
...and you ran and hid
in a cardboard box!

01:04:28.822 --> 01:04:30.532
Yes, damn it!

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:33.160
That's what your father is!

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:37.289
He can't bet, he's spineless,
his feet stink and he can't drink!

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:41.335
He kills off his wife and daughter
to buy sympathy!

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:44.337
He said you had
an incurable disease!

01:04:44.504 --> 01:04:49.675
With a father like that,
you have my sympathy!

01:04:50.009 --> 01:04:52.970
Is this how you repay me?!

01:04:53.346 --> 01:04:55.056
Repay you?!

01:04:55.223 --> 01:04:57.141
Am I hearing right?

01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.477
If we're talking about debt,
I'm waiting for my change!

01:04:59.685 --> 01:05:02.146
Debt's a concept
you don't even understand!

01:05:02.355 --> 01:05:05.817
You understand how to troll
through garbage cans!

01:05:06.025 --> 01:05:08.861
And how to get in debt
and how to make babies.

01:05:09.028 --> 01:05:12.573
Though you're not too good
at raising them, are you?

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.660
And your debts
you shove off on your wife.

01:05:15.827 --> 01:05:19.205
Always running away,
never doing anything right!

01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:22.083
Running away's
the only racing you ever did!

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:25.336
Miyuki! We're leaving!

01:05:28.214 --> 01:05:29.340
Miss Hana?

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.889
I guess he's better.

01:05:38.224 --> 01:05:41.269
Should you have said that
in front of her?

01:05:44.063 --> 01:05:47.358
If she's his daughter,
she'll forgive him.

01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:53.530
Being able to speak freely...

01:05:53.697 --> 01:05:56.533
...is the lifeblood of love.

01:05:57.576 --> 01:05:59.077
Maybe I'm naive.

01:06:01.955 --> 01:06:04.291
So you're in love with him?

01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:07.919
Don't be silly.
I'm the Weeping Red Devil.

01:06:08.086 --> 01:06:08.753
What?

01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:12.132
It's a story I love.

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:17.637
There was a red devil who
wanted to be friends with people.

01:06:18.597 --> 01:06:23.310
But since he was a devil,
no one would go near him.

01:06:23.477 --> 01:06:27.147
So his friend the blue devil
made a plan.

01:06:28.273 --> 01:06:33.778
He'd wreak havoc among the people,
and the red devil would save them.

01:06:39.451 --> 01:06:42.579
When you try to achieve something,
someone's bound to get hurt.

01:06:43.622 --> 01:06:45.957
You always have to
sacrifice something.

01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:48.919
The plan worked.

01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:54.007
But the blue devil had to go away
so they'd never know it was a trick.

01:06:56.843 --> 01:06:58.427
It's a sad story.

01:06:58.636 --> 01:07:02.807
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?

01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:07.144
It's best for everyone
when they're with their family.

01:07:07.311 --> 01:07:09.313
Soon we'll find Kiyoko's mother.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.818
And then what?
You don't have a real family!

01:07:23.828 --> 01:07:27.164
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery

01:07:27.331 --> 01:07:31.961
Numbers have been drawn for the
annual New Year's Jumbo Lottery.

01:07:32.503 --> 01:07:35.923
Top prize in the 200-million-yen
lottery is a very rare number.

01:07:36.674 --> 01:07:40.803
Group 11, number 111, 111...

01:07:41.053 --> 01:07:43.722
...is worth 50 million yen.

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:45.683
A different group pays 100,000 yen.

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:50.146
To repeat,
the winning prize number is...

01:07:52.022 --> 01:07:53.649
This just in.

01:07:54.108 --> 01:07:57.695
Police have released a sketch
of an infant taken...

01:07:57.862 --> 01:08:01.657
...from a hospital in
Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward.

01:08:04.034 --> 01:08:08.997
We've come all the way here,
but we don't have her address!

01:08:09.164 --> 01:08:11.708
The geezer's got it!
Let's go back.

01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:14.210
Where are you going?

01:08:15.795 --> 01:08:20.008
- The police!
- What? You hated that idea!

01:08:20.925 --> 01:08:22.886
I was just ego-tripping.

01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:26.848
Now I want to apologize
to her parents.

01:08:27.055 --> 01:08:31.352
They might not be able to sleep
waiting for news about her.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.189
That's what we said
from the very start!

01:08:35.398 --> 01:08:39.527
They might even be
about to commit suicide!

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:43.198
I've done something
that can't be taken back!

01:08:43.406 --> 01:08:45.867
I'll throw myself in this river.

01:08:46.075 --> 01:08:50.205
I'll step neatly out of my shoes, stand
on the handrail, and be at peace.

01:08:50.412 --> 01:08:53.416
But then I'll see
a baby's face on the water.

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:58.296
No! While I see this child's face,
I cannot die!

01:08:58.462 --> 01:09:00.215
Hey, you!

01:09:00.423 --> 01:09:01.633
No!

01:09:03.968 --> 01:09:05.094
You're too young for this!

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:07.388
Please! Let me die!

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.563
You!

01:09:17.356 --> 01:09:18.564
Sachiko Nishizawa.

01:09:23.111 --> 01:09:25.072
What were you thinking of?!

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.282
Is that an apology?

01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:31.578
If we hadn't found this child,
she would've frozen to death!

01:09:31.787 --> 01:09:33.080
It wasn't me!

01:09:33.287 --> 01:09:36.457
My husband took her away
when I wasn't there!

01:09:37.626 --> 01:09:40.420
I've looked and looked!

01:09:47.636 --> 01:09:48.804
Is that true?

01:09:51.974 --> 01:09:57.146
All I've suffered
on account of that man!

01:10:08.449 --> 01:10:11.326
"Hi, Mom!"

01:10:19.376 --> 01:10:22.962
God really loves this child,
you know.

01:10:23.337 --> 01:10:26.466
I want you to give her
lots of love too.

01:10:26.883 --> 01:10:29.802
Do right by her,
or you'll pay for it.

01:10:29.969 --> 01:10:31.804
I'm so sorry!

01:10:32.013 --> 01:10:33.222
I'm sorry!

01:10:43.232 --> 01:10:44.859
Mrs. Nishizawa!

01:11:31.404 --> 01:11:32.531
What are you doing in here?!

01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:35.033
Get out of here! Get out!

01:11:35.617 --> 01:11:37.577
Wait! I'm no thief.

01:11:37.744 --> 01:11:40.080
You're lying! Get out!

01:11:40.247 --> 01:11:41.373
Where's the baby?!

01:11:44.918 --> 01:11:48.088
Did an old queer and a girl
come to give it back?

01:11:48.255 --> 01:11:49.798
What are you talking about?!

01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:52.092
You abandoned a baby!

01:11:54.302 --> 01:11:56.388
I can prove it.

01:11:56.847 --> 01:11:58.932
Are you a cop?

01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:03.728
Huh? I'm just a bum
who was passing by.

01:12:04.938 --> 01:12:06.898
Are you right in the head?

01:12:07.107 --> 01:12:09.234
I'm damn near crazy
from all this!

01:12:09.609 --> 01:12:14.739
Why is the baby you abandoned
on the news as being "taken away"?

01:12:14.948 --> 01:12:17.409
They'll call us kidnappers!

01:12:17.951 --> 01:12:22.038
It wasn't me.
That's not my kid.

01:12:24.624 --> 01:12:25.584
What?

01:12:27.461 --> 01:12:29.671
There, there! Don't cry!

01:12:29.838 --> 01:12:30.922
Take care.

01:12:31.631 --> 01:12:33.258
Raise her right.

01:12:33.425 --> 01:12:35.509
See you again someday.

01:12:37.136 --> 01:12:39.763
Never leave her again.

01:13:02.661 --> 01:13:10.169
On the year's last day / when all of a
life's accounts / have been settled up.

01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:25.142
Sachiko stole that baby
out of the hospital.

01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:29.563
She stole a baby
and then abandoned it?!

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:31.649
That's a person's life!

01:13:31.816 --> 01:13:34.401
She lied to me about it!

01:13:34.568 --> 01:13:37.822
And now it's gone
way out of control.

01:13:38.197 --> 01:13:42.659
I don't want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!

01:13:42.826 --> 01:13:44.244
What?!

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:48.164
Don't act like
you're not part of this!

01:13:48.373 --> 01:13:51.501
You don't want to get involved?
You're her husband!

01:13:51.918 --> 01:13:56.047
That's all over!
I'm getting my life back together.

01:13:56.297 --> 01:13:57.006
Look!

01:13:57.215 --> 01:14:01.010
I won 100,000 yen in the lottery.
My luck's turned!

01:14:04.556 --> 01:14:10.520
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.

01:14:10.895 --> 01:14:13.022
No. They threw him away.

01:14:13.273 --> 01:14:15.275
I'm no loser!

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.365
These were in your wife's bag.

01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:28.037
Any idea where
she might have gone?

01:14:28.288 --> 01:14:31.541
She said she was going
to be with her baby.

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:34.878
She was going to kill herself!

01:14:36.754 --> 01:14:38.381
There's no time to waste!

01:14:38.548 --> 01:14:42.093
No! She was just going
to go look for the kid.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.721
She's desperate.
That only means one thing!

01:14:46.431 --> 01:14:47.891
But where do I look?!

01:15:04.072 --> 01:15:05.073
Hana!

01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:06.575
Miyuki!

01:15:08.285 --> 01:15:09.578
Kiyoko!

01:15:15.876 --> 01:15:18.420
God must be busy
at this time of year.

01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:20.923
Better once a year than never.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.549
Geezer?

01:15:32.142 --> 01:15:36.104
You're too late. You just missed
a very moving finale.

01:15:36.313 --> 01:15:38.232
What's the matter?

01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:42.986
"Kiyoko"!

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:47.366
"Stomach"?

01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:50.786
"Mother"!

01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:52.496
Now that's settled...

01:15:52.663 --> 01:15:54.373
...what the hell do you mean?!

01:15:54.832 --> 01:15:58.709
Fake! The mother!
Sachiko's a fake!

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.963
Pardon?

01:16:07.593 --> 01:16:10.138
Why won't you drink?

01:16:10.888 --> 01:16:15.351
A baby has to drink
from its mother's breast.

01:16:15.977 --> 01:16:20.064
We'll never be close
if you don't!

01:16:26.529 --> 01:16:28.197
Sorry. Wrong people.

01:16:30.741 --> 01:16:32.702
She can't be far!

01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:35.079
But where do we look?

01:16:35.246 --> 01:16:37.874
We can't just give her up now!

01:16:50.845 --> 01:16:52.346
That's Kiyoko!

01:16:59.562 --> 01:17:01.147
Should you be running?

01:17:01.314 --> 01:17:03.899
If I don't run now, when will I?

01:17:04.316 --> 01:17:05.192
This way!

01:17:19.498 --> 01:17:23.418
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!

01:17:23.585 --> 01:17:25.337
Who said "family suicide"?

01:17:25.504 --> 01:17:26.963
You did!

01:17:33.094 --> 01:17:34.054
- Which way?
- Left.

01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:36.264
- Okay, right!
- Why?

01:17:36.765 --> 01:17:38.016
You're a lousy gambler!

01:17:38.183 --> 01:17:40.268
You got that right.

01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:42.312
Somebody help!

01:17:55.951 --> 01:17:57.202
Hey!

01:17:57.702 --> 01:17:58.578
Wait!

01:17:58.787 --> 01:18:00.413
Thief! Thief!

01:18:00.622 --> 01:18:01.248
What's wrong?

01:18:01.456 --> 01:18:05.001
A woman just stole my truck!

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:06.962
Hey! Thief!

01:18:07.129 --> 01:18:09.256
Yes! That woman!

01:18:09.756 --> 01:18:12.550
She's a baby thief!

01:18:27.022 --> 01:18:30.359
Be quiet, will you?
Please! Be a good baby!

01:18:38.742 --> 01:18:40.995
Stop! Give Kiyoko back!

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:47.251
Give me a break!

01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:49.462
I'm forever in your debt!

01:18:54.675 --> 01:18:55.676
Gin!

01:18:57.386 --> 01:18:59.513
That woman's crazy!

01:19:00.055 --> 01:19:00.890
Get closer!

01:19:01.056 --> 01:19:01.849
I can't!

01:19:02.016 --> 01:19:04.310
You have to, for Kiyoko!

01:19:04.518 --> 01:19:06.312
- Who's Kiyoko?!
- Step on it like a man!

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.646
Okay!

01:19:12.526 --> 01:19:15.112
Please! Be quiet!

01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:20.366
- Gin!
- Geezer?!

01:19:23.995 --> 01:19:24.662
Geezer!

01:19:24.871 --> 01:19:28.333
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:30.084
Pass her!

01:19:30.251 --> 01:19:31.044
We'll die!

01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:31.961
Step on it!

01:19:32.128 --> 01:19:33.797
Okay!

01:19:35.548 --> 01:19:37.217
Stop crying!

01:19:38.092 --> 01:19:41.179
Don't be afraid.
I'll never leave you again.

01:19:41.721 --> 01:19:42.764
You want to die?!

01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:53.900
Gin!

01:20:05.954 --> 01:20:07.288
Gin!

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:10.875
There!

01:20:12.585 --> 01:20:14.170
- Are you okay?!
- Where's Kiyoko?

01:20:14.337 --> 01:20:15.922
- Faster!
- Okay!

01:20:35.607 --> 01:20:36.108
Which way?

01:21:23.447 --> 01:21:25.115
We're at the scene...

01:21:25.324 --> 01:21:29.787
...where a truck has crashed
into a building in Shinagawa.

01:21:29.995 --> 01:21:34.248
Now a woman holding a baby
has appeared on the roof.

01:21:34.749 --> 01:21:39.462
Witnesses say the woman
is connected with the incident...

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:41.923
...as she was driving the truck.

01:21:48.179 --> 01:21:50.973
Now there's someone else
on the roof!

01:21:55.686 --> 01:21:56.562
Stay away!

01:21:56.729 --> 01:21:58.898
No!

01:22:05.738 --> 01:22:08.199
Tell me why you took
that baby.

01:22:08.366 --> 01:22:09.075
I didn't!

01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:11.786
This baby is mine!

01:22:11.953 --> 01:22:15.498
You're lying! Its real parents
are worried sick about it!

01:22:15.706 --> 01:22:16.833
That's not true!

01:22:17.041 --> 01:22:20.962
You of all people should know
what it's like to lose a child!

01:22:32.473 --> 01:22:37.728
She's dead. My baby died
before she was even born!

01:22:45.152 --> 01:22:48.905
All the other babies
looked so healthy there in the ward.

01:22:49.072 --> 01:22:51.575
I wanted to die.

01:22:51.741 --> 01:22:54.327
But then this baby
smiled at me.

01:22:54.494 --> 01:22:56.538
I decided she was mine.

01:22:56.746 --> 01:23:00.834
I thought as long as I had her,
everything would be fine.

01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:04.671
My husband would mend his ways,
and we'd be a real family.

01:23:04.838 --> 01:23:06.631
That's bullshit!

01:23:07.007 --> 01:23:12.262
Build a family by ruining a baby's life?
If you're going to die, do it alone!

01:23:12.429 --> 01:23:17.267
A life is a life. It's only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.

01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:24.858
Give her back, okay?

01:23:32.199 --> 01:23:34.117
I want to be reborn.

01:23:35.118 --> 01:23:37.204
Sachiko!

01:23:38.455 --> 01:23:41.458
Sachiko, don't die!
Come back to me!

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:45.462
I was wrong!
Please, don't kill yourself!

01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:48.464
We'll start again!
We'll be reborn!

01:23:48.798 --> 01:23:50.424
Sachiko!

01:23:50.633 --> 01:23:53.427
I'll go first and wait for you.

01:23:57.807 --> 01:23:58.933
Sachiko!

01:24:01.393 --> 01:24:02.645
Please! Let me die!

01:24:02.812 --> 01:24:05.898
Kiyoko wants to see
her mom and dad!

01:24:11.862 --> 01:24:13.322
I want to go home.

01:24:16.617 --> 01:24:18.953
I'm sorry!

01:24:26.627 --> 01:24:27.545
Take her...

01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:30.798
...to her mother and father.

01:24:40.266 --> 01:24:41.016
Oh, no.

01:24:42.017 --> 01:24:43.352
Hana!

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.188
I'm okay!

01:24:46.772 --> 01:24:48.190
I'm still alive!

01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:32.817
Inspector, I don't know
how to thank you.

01:25:32.984 --> 01:25:36.654
We're not the ones
you should thank.

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:43.828
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.

01:25:43.995 --> 01:25:46.247
- In my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:46.414 --> 01:25:49.667
That was some New Year's!

01:25:50.502 --> 01:25:52.253
It's "No Smoking" here.

01:25:52.462 --> 01:25:55.548
Lighten up! I'm a hero!

01:25:55.757 --> 01:25:57.884
You mean "we"!

01:26:01.346 --> 01:26:06.642
I guess we won't have to listen to
Kiyoko's damn crying anymore.

01:26:06.809 --> 01:26:09.019
She's not "Kiyoko" anymore.

01:26:09.186 --> 01:26:11.522
I'm not pleased.

01:26:12.439 --> 01:26:14.233
What can we do?

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:16.068
Not that.

01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:18.779
This is a men's ward!

01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:23.200
Perhaps we're intruding.

01:26:23.367 --> 01:26:25.577
No, it's just...

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.539
...I'm told they're homeless.

01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:29.915
Who cares?

01:26:30.124 --> 01:26:33.001
We'd like them to be
her godfathers.

01:26:34.795 --> 01:26:35.796
Come in.

01:26:37.005 --> 01:26:38.006
Excuse us.

01:26:38.799 --> 01:26:42.219
The baby's parents
would like to thank you

01:26:47.891 --> 01:26:49.268
Dad...
