WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:03.599
Here's what I wonder
about zombies.

00:05.593 --> 00:08.495
What happens if they can't get
any human flesh to eat?

00:08.496 --> 00:11.698
They can't starve to death--
they're already dead.

00:11.699 --> 00:14.601
You take this one.
I spent an hour last night on

00:14.602 --> 00:16.102
"How do vampires shave

00:16.103 --> 00:18.204
when they can't see
themselves in the mirror"?

00:19.373 --> 00:21.007
Well-groomed vampires
meet in pairs

00:21.008 --> 00:23.142
and shave each other--
case closed.

00:24.377 --> 00:26.712
Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

00:26.713 --> 00:28.714
I guess it depends
on the zombies, Raj.

00:28.715 --> 00:30.516
Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

00:30.517 --> 00:32.718
Like, in <i>28 Days,</i>
<i>if those zombies didn't eat,</i>

00:32.719 --> 00:33.986
they starved.
You're thinking

00:33.987 --> 00:35.588
of <i>28 Days Later.</i>

00:35.589 --> 00:37.622
<i>28 Days</i> is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab

00:37.623 --> 00:40.391
and puts the audience
into an undead state

00:41.233 --> 00:42.834
Hey, don't bag
on Sandra Bullock!

00:42.835 --> 00:44.703
You think it makes you
look cultured,

00:44.704 --> 00:47.506
but you just
come off as bitter.

00:47.507 --> 00:50.509
Oh, Dr. Siebert,
twelve o'clock.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.811
Why's the president
of the university

00:52.812 --> 00:54.812
slumming in the cafeteria?

00:54.813 --> 00:56.914
Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V,

00:56.915 --> 00:59.316
who dressed as a commoner
and mingled among them,

00:59.317 --> 01:02.352
to find out how he was being
perceived by his subjects.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.387
Of course, if he'd

01:03.388 --> 01:05.155
have read any
of the 1,300 e-mails

01:05.156 --> 01:07.190
I've sent him on the subject
of his administration,

01:07.191 --> 01:08.443
he could have saved himself
the trouble.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.474
Or maybe he heard it's
Tator Tot Tuesday.

01:11.475 --> 01:13.010
That's why I'm here.

01:14.345 --> 01:16.379
Hey, there's
my favorite geniuses!

01:16.380 --> 01:18.381
How are we doing today?

01:18.382 --> 01:19.783
That depends--
how much longer

01:19.784 --> 01:22.519
do you plan on
fondling my shoulder?

01:22.520 --> 01:25.521
Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot
you have a touch phobia.

01:25.522 --> 01:27.923
It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

01:27.924 --> 01:30.693
If you'd like to go put on
a pair of latex gloves,

01:30.694 --> 01:32.594
I'll let you check me
for a hernia.

01:32.595 --> 01:34.396
Yeah.

01:34.397 --> 01:37.166
So, listen, fellas, who's up
for a little party this Saturday night?

01:37.167 --> 01:40.369
Open bar, good eats, might
even be a few pretty girls.

01:40.370 --> 01:41.569
Sounds great!
I'm in!

01:41.570 --> 01:43.004
Hold on.

01:43.005 --> 01:45.106
Just because the nice man
is offering you candy,

01:45.107 --> 01:47.408
doesn't mean you should jump
into his windowless van.

01:48.944 --> 01:51.312
What's the occasion?

01:51.313 --> 01:53.514
Just a little fund-raiser
for the university.

01:53.515 --> 01:57.151
Aha! The tear-stained air
mattress in the back of the van.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.019
I understand
your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

02:00.020 --> 02:02.254
and I sympathize,
but the hard facts are,

02:02.255 --> 02:04.523
occasionally,
we have to shake a few hands

02:04.524 --> 02:06.626
and kiss a few butts
to raise money for our research.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.476
I don't care;
it's demeaning.

02:08.477 --> 02:10.878
And I refuse to be
trotted out and shown off

02:10.880 --> 02:13.114
like a prize hog
at the Texas State Fair.

02:13.115 --> 02:15.749
Which, by the way, is something
you don't want to attend

02:15.750 --> 02:18.286
wearing a Star Trek
ensign's uniform.

02:18.287 --> 02:19.420
All right,

02:19.421 --> 02:20.888
let me put it this way.

02:20.889 --> 02:23.590
You're gonna put on a suit,
you're gonna come to this party,

02:23.591 --> 02:25.293
and you're gonna
explain your research

02:25.294 --> 02:26.760
to a bunch of old people,

02:26.761 --> 02:29.762
or I swear to God,
I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

02:29.763 --> 02:33.033
like they did  to that little boy
in <i>Slumdog Millionaire.</i>

02:33.034 --> 02:35.001
Oh, you don't want that.

02:35.002 --> 02:37.404
So, Saturday night!

02:37.405 --> 02:39.205
It's gonna be
off the hook.
Ugh!

02:39.206 --> 02:40.206
Get over it.

02:42.709 --> 02:43.876
Oh, boy!

02:43.877 --> 02:45.911
Tator tots and
a party invitation?

02:45.912 --> 02:47.712

03:20.788 --> 03:22.822
Are you sure
this is right?

03:22.823 --> 03:26.960
Yeah, just tuck that
part in your pants;  you'll be fine.

03:26.961 --> 03:31.998
Okay, let's go smooch some
rich, wrinkled <i>tochis.</i>

03:31.999 --> 03:34.167
Oh, Howard, I can't believe
Bernadette let you go

03:34.168 --> 03:36.101
to a fancy party
wearing a dickey.

03:36.102 --> 03:39.304
Excuse me, my girlfriend
doesn't pick out my clothes.

03:39.305 --> 03:41.574
My mother does.

03:42.111 --> 03:43.278
Oh. We should
get going.

03:43.322 --> 03:44.389
What about Sheldon?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.467
Sheldon is not going.

03:46.538 --> 03:48.305
Really? What do we tell Siebert?

03:48.953 --> 03:52.255
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels
that the best use of his time

03:52.273 --> 03:55.106
is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties

03:55.125 --> 03:58.861
to tear the mask off nature
and stare at the face of God.

04:00.431 --> 04:03.366
Sheldon, it's Saturday night,
you'll be doing laundry.

04:03.367 --> 04:06.836
Don't tell him that,
tell him the mask thing.

04:12.375 --> 04:14.776
Hey, put your tie
back in your pants.

04:16.446 --> 04:18.046
Nice place.

04:18.047 --> 04:20.649
Reminds me of my parents'
house back in New Delhi.

04:20.649 --> 04:22.818
- You're kidding.
- No. We are very wealthy.

04:22.819 --> 04:25.919
But the only difference is,
we have more servants.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.699
- More than this?
- More than we can use.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.161
You see, in India,
we don't make the mistake

04:29.201 --> 04:31.669
of letting our poor people
have dreams.

04:32.627 --> 04:36.029
Ah. There's my band
of brainiacs.

04:36.030 --> 04:37.130
Where's Dr. Cooper?

04:38.700 --> 04:43.002
He's tearing the mask off nature
to look at the face of God.

04:43.003 --> 04:45.672
The board of directors insists
he has a beautiful mind.

04:45.673 --> 04:47.006
I think he's just bananas.

04:48.008 --> 04:49.376
Come on, let me introduce you

04:49.377 --> 04:51.143
to one of the university's
leading donors.

04:53.614 --> 04:56.915
I think we were misled
about the cute girls.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.418
Mrs. Latham, I'd like
you to meet three

04:59.419 --> 05:00.886
of our outstanding
young researchers.

05:00.887 --> 05:02.454
This is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,

05:02.455 --> 05:05.891
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
and Howard Wolowitz.

05:05.892 --> 05:07.393
Well, what happened
to you, Wolowitz,

05:07.394 --> 05:10.262
couldn't stick with it
long enough to get your PhD?

05:10.263 --> 05:12.096
I'm an engineer.

05:12.097 --> 05:14.064
Most engineers
don't bother with a PhD.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.900
But you may be
interested to know

05:15.901 --> 05:19.203
I designed the zero-gravity
waste-disposal system for NASA.

05:19.204 --> 05:21.363
Got it--
you're a space plumber.

05:23.881 --> 05:26.149
I'm gonna go hit the bar.

05:27.779 --> 05:29.846
Tell me about
these two.

05:29.847 --> 05:32.348
- Do him first.
- Dr. Hofstadter

05:32.349 --> 05:34.818
is representing our
experimental physics
program tonight.

05:34.819 --> 05:36.185
I think you'll
really enjoy

05:36.186 --> 05:37.387
hearing about his
fascinating work.

05:37.388 --> 05:38.455
Right.

05:38.456 --> 05:40.189
Fascinate me.

05:42.794 --> 05:45.994
They're cute when they're about
to wet themselves, aren't they?

05:45.995 --> 05:47.996
I'll make it
easy for you.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.998
When you arrive at the lab
in the morning,

05:49.999 --> 05:51.801
what sort of machine
do you turn on?

05:53.002 --> 05:55.137
Coffee maker?

05:55.138 --> 05:58.941
All right, Dr. Kooth--
uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.475
It's Koothrappal

06:00.476 --> 06:02.477
I have to tinkle.

06:05.974 --> 06:08.342
And so, instead
of bowing to pressure,

06:08.343 --> 06:10.378
and going to that
pointless soiree,

06:10.379 --> 06:13.881
I stayed right here
and did a load of whites.

06:13.882 --> 06:17.650
Well, normally I respect
your macho rebellious attitude

06:17.651 --> 06:19.386
toward "The Man,"

06:19.387 --> 06:23.190
but, in this case, I think
you've made a foolish mistake.

06:23.191 --> 06:24.856
Unlikely.

06:25.925 --> 06:27.226
But make your case.

06:27.227 --> 06:29.728
Keeping in mind that
your critical attitude

06:29.729 --> 06:31.730
is ruining our
Saturday night together,

06:31.731 --> 06:34.500
and I'm not above
minimizing your window.

06:34.501 --> 06:36.835
Sheldon, like it or not,

06:36.836 --> 06:39.271
until you manage
to upload your intelligence

06:39.272 --> 06:41.239
into a self-sustaining
orbiting satellite,

06:41.240 --> 06:43.608
equipped with high-speed
Internet and a cloaking device,

06:43.609 --> 06:46.911
you will be dependent on other
members of the human race.

06:46.912 --> 06:49.680
That's it.
Prepare to be minimized.

06:49.681 --> 06:51.483
I'm not finished.

06:51.484 --> 06:53.184
All scientists have
to fund-raise, Sheldon.

06:53.185 --> 06:55.453
How do you think
I paid for my lab?

06:55.454 --> 06:58.021
I went to Saudi Arabia
and met with a prince

06:58.022 --> 06:59.923
who had an interest
in neurobiology.

06:59.924 --> 07:03.727
Your lab is funded by some
Middle-Eastern dilettante?

07:03.728 --> 07:06.430
Technically,
Faisal is my fiancé.

07:08.466 --> 07:11.067
But I do have a state-of-the-art
two-photon microscope

07:11.068 --> 07:14.069
and a place to stay in Riyadh
for the winter.

07:14.070 --> 07:17.273
Well, that explains those
puzzling camel race photos

07:17.274 --> 07:19.642
on your Facebook page.

07:19.643 --> 07:21.177
And consider this:

07:21.178 --> 07:23.812
without you to make the case
for the physics department,

07:23.813 --> 07:26.415
the task will fall to people
like Leonard and Rajesh.

07:26.416 --> 07:28.617
Are you trying to scare me?

07:28.618 --> 07:30.885
'Cause you're succeeding.

07:30.886 --> 07:32.621
Well, then prepare
to be terrified.

07:32.622 --> 07:34.256
If your friends
are unconvincing,

07:34.257 --> 07:36.258
this year's donations
might go to,

07:36.259 --> 07:37.725
say, the geology department.

07:37.726 --> 07:40.395
Oh, dear, the dirt people!

07:42.865 --> 07:45.132
Or worse-- it could go to...

07:45.133 --> 07:47.168
the liberal arts.

07:48.570 --> 07:50.937
No!

07:50.938 --> 07:54.007
Millions of dollars
being showered on poets,

07:54.008 --> 07:57.678
literary theorists
and students of gender studies.

07:58.713 --> 08:01.714
Oh, the humanities!

08:03.116 --> 08:05.485
On the bright side, I don't
think President Siebert

08:05.486 --> 08:08.688
will be making us go
to any more fund-raisers.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.623
It was so much easier
at my bar mitzvah.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.958
The old people just came up
to you, pinched your cheek

08:12.959 --> 08:15.461
and handed you a savings bond.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.696
Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

08:17.697 --> 08:20.465
Look at the size
of these shrimp!

08:20.466 --> 08:24.169
At what point do we start
calling them lobsters?

08:24.170 --> 08:27.472
Face it, Raj,
we crashed and burned tonight.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.608
Oh, you didn't
do that badly.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.043
Mrs. Latham, the first machine
I turn on in the morning

08:33.044 --> 08:35.580
is the helium-neon laser,
'cause it needs to warm up.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.148
I no longer care, dear.

08:38.149 --> 08:39.650
But don't worry,

08:39.650 --> 08:41.652
I really enjoyed
meeting you this evening.

08:41.653 --> 08:43.621
u're kidding.
That was good for you?

08:43.621 --> 08:45.889
'Cause I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.225
Excellent! There's
nothing I like better

08:48.226 --> 08:50.927
than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

08:50.928 --> 08:52.829
Why?

08:52.830 --> 08:55.031
Oh, I don't know,
it's one of the fun things

08:55.032 --> 08:57.834
you get to do when
you have lots of money.

08:57.835 --> 08:59.269
Watch.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.938
Hey! Who said you
could eat that shrimp?

09:05.709 --> 09:07.476
See? Fun.

09:07.477 --> 09:09.745
No, no, no, I'm just here

09:09.746 --> 09:11.046
for your money.

09:11.047 --> 09:13.449
I don't want to shake
anyone's germy hands.

09:14.751 --> 09:16.952
Explain it to
them, Siebert.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.504
I must confess

09:22.505 --> 09:24.106
I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

09:24.107 --> 09:26.875
First you say you want me
to appear at your fund-raisers,

09:26.876 --> 09:29.378
but now you say
you never want me to go

09:29.379 --> 09:31.112
anywhere near your fund-raisers.

09:31.113 --> 09:34.115
Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.716
Here we go again.

09:35.717 --> 09:37.885
If there's simply
no talking to me,

09:37.886 --> 09:40.955
why did you call?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.823
I'm sorry, someone's
on the other line.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.393
Why don't you see if you
can organize your thoughts,

09:45.394 --> 09:48.528
and we'll try again later.

09:48.529 --> 09:51.164
Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

09:51.165 --> 09:53.266
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

09:53.267 --> 09:55.402
Well, yes, of course
I remember you.

09:55.403 --> 09:57.070
A woman well past her prime

09:57.071 --> 09:58.972
seeking to augment
her social status

09:58.973 --> 10:01.908
by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

10:03.343 --> 10:06.845
So, how much money
are you going to give me?

10:06.846 --> 10:10.182
I'm not crazy--
my mother had me tested.

10:10.183 --> 10:11.717
Well, if you're not

10:11.718 --> 10:14.420
going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

10:14.421 --> 10:16.522
She wants to talk to you.

10:17.657 --> 10:19.690
Who's crazy now?

10:20.893 --> 10:22.860
Hello, Mrs. Latham.

10:22.861 --> 10:25.763
Yes, I live with him.

10:25.764 --> 10:28.266
I don't...
I-I really don't know why.

10:33.972 --> 10:37.307
Tonight? Sure,
that'd be great.

10:37.308 --> 10:39.709
Okay, I'll see you then.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.078
Bye.

10:41.079 --> 10:44.214
She wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

10:44.215 --> 10:47.684
An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

10:49.020 --> 10:52.088
Where you going, the drive-thru
at Jack in the Box?

10:54.425 --> 10:56.692
Well, wherever
we're going,

10:56.693 --> 10:59.828
she's sending a car
to pick me up.

10:59.829 --> 11:01.164
Okay,

11:01.165 --> 11:03.266
- I see what's happening.
- What?

11:03.267 --> 11:05.435
My stature intimidates her,

11:05.436 --> 11:08.703
so she's using you to get to me.

11:10.005 --> 11:12.941
Crafty old gal.

11:12.942 --> 11:15.810
Excuse me, but you are not the
only distinguished scientist

11:15.811 --> 11:17.112
in this apartment.

11:17.113 --> 11:18.880
I've been published in
peer-reviewed journals,

11:18.881 --> 11:21.015
I received a Dissertation
of the Year award

11:21.016 --> 11:23.016
for experimental
particle physics.

11:23.017 --> 11:25.453
No, that can't be it.

11:25.454 --> 11:26.887
And since you seem

11:26.888 --> 11:29.090
to have forgotten,
the reason we live together

11:29.091 --> 11:30.757
is we're best friends.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.859
And I got your back, Jack.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.598
That was a great meal.
I'm glad you
enjoyed it.

11:38.599 --> 11:41.701
The only time I eat this well
is when my mom's in town

11:41.702 --> 11:44.204
- and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?

11:44.205 --> 11:46.038
You kind of
remind me of her.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.775
She enjoys making people
uncomfortable, too.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.845
Well, you remind me of
a boy I dated in college.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.779
- No kidding.
- Sweet boy.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.081
Very smart.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.550
If only he'd had money.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.020
Yeah, um...

12:02.021 --> 12:04.490
so, hey,
speaking of money,

12:04.491 --> 12:07.792
how are you feeling about
helping the physics department

12:07.793 --> 12:10.728
get a cryogenic centrifugal
pump and molecular sieve?

12:10.729 --> 12:14.198
Well, I must say, you make a
very persuasive case for it.

12:14.199 --> 12:16.467
Oh, good, good.
And I'm seriously

12:16.468 --> 12:19.136
considering taking it
to the next level.

12:19.137 --> 12:21.171
Terrific. Great.

12:21.172 --> 12:23.406
What level is that?

12:29.747 --> 12:32.849
Okay, now you don't
remind me of my mom.

12:37.754 --> 12:42.591
I'm sorry, so, eventually,
zombies are going to attack

12:42.592 --> 12:45.561
the rehab facility
where Sandra Bullock is?

12:47.864 --> 12:50.298
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.935
You know, it's a shame, all that
work she's doing to get sober,

12:54.936 --> 12:57.104
only to be torn apart
and eaten alive.

12:59.308 --> 13:00.841
Hey. How was dinner?

13:00.842 --> 13:03.278
Swell. I need a drink.

13:03.279 --> 13:05.579
Do we have any alcohol?

13:05.580 --> 13:09.683
No. But we have potatoes--
I could make you vodka.

13:09.684 --> 13:11.051
It'll take two weeks.

13:12.353 --> 13:13.387
Leonard, are you okay?

13:13.388 --> 13:15.922
Um, I'm not sure.

13:15.923 --> 13:17.357
What's going on?

13:17.358 --> 13:20.594
Well, Mrs. Latham said
she was seriously considering

13:20.595 --> 13:23.762
donating money so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

13:23.763 --> 13:25.298
Yes!
Oh, wow!

13:25.299 --> 13:28.201
...then she stuck
her tongue down my throat.

13:28.202 --> 13:30.869
Why?

13:30.870 --> 13:32.438
Okay, we can't keep
explaining everything.

13:32.439 --> 13:34.039
Read that book
we got you.

13:35.842 --> 13:37.609
She hit on me.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.010
Wait-wait-wait.
Are you telling us

13:39.011 --> 13:41.479
that old lady wanted
to have sex with you

13:41.480 --> 13:45.217
in exchange for giving your
department millions of dollars?

13:45.218 --> 13:46.418
I think so.

13:46.419 --> 13:48.687
You lucky duck.

13:48.688 --> 13:53.224
You're really
a broken toy, aren't you?

13:53.225 --> 13:55.559
I was able to get out of there
before anything else happened,

13:55.560 --> 13:57.361
but she wants to see me again
tomorrow night.

13:57.362 --> 14:00.097
Excellent!
What are you planning to wear?

14:00.098 --> 14:01.699
What?

14:01.700 --> 14:05.236
Penny, you're an expert on trading
sexual favors for material gain--

14:05.237 --> 14:07.904
walk him through this.

14:07.905 --> 14:11.841
Well, n-no, hold on a second,
I'm not going to sleep with her.

14:11.842 --> 14:15.245
But we need a cryogenic
centrifugal pump.

14:15.246 --> 14:17.947
Well, forget it!
It's not gonna happen.

14:17.948 --> 14:20.983
Well, come now, Leonard,
this may be your only chance

14:20.984 --> 14:23.386
to make a real contribution
to science!

14:23.387 --> 14:26.555
I repeat: Not gonna happen.

14:29.659 --> 14:32.527
What was all that
about me trading sexual favors

14:32.528 --> 14:34.229
for material gain?

14:34.230 --> 14:36.698
It was a compliment.

14:36.699 --> 14:39.568
I believe in giving credit
where credit is due.

14:42.237 --> 14:44.238
Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

14:44.239 --> 14:46.874
Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car
is here for you.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.909
I won't be too late;
I'm just gonna make

14:48.910 --> 14:51.412
a final pitch for the funding
and then say good night.

14:51.413 --> 14:53.781
Hold on,
I have something for you.

14:53.782 --> 14:56.150
What's this?

14:56.151 --> 14:57.984
Just a few things you
may need tonight.

14:57.985 --> 15:00.953
Baby oil, condoms
and, uh...

15:00.954 --> 15:03.856
a little something I procured from the
school of pharmacology.

15:03.857 --> 15:07.794
They say it is to Viagra as
Viagra is to a green M&M.

15:11.365 --> 15:14.533
I am not going
to have sex with her.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.234
Maybe this will overcome
your reluctance.

15:16.235 --> 15:18.870
I went on the Internet
and found a photograph

15:18.871 --> 15:22.941
of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham
to get your libido humming.

15:24.477 --> 15:28.314
Check out those saddle shoes.

15:33.719 --> 15:35.052
Are you insane?

15:35.053 --> 15:36.854
I'm not going
to prostitute myself

15:36.855 --> 15:39.156
just so we can get
some new equipment.

15:39.157 --> 15:40.725
Oh, come on! Why not?

15:40.726 --> 15:42.560
Good night,

15:42.561 --> 15:44.161
Sheldon.
Given how much time

15:44.162 --> 15:46.330
you spend engaging
in pointless self-abuse,

15:46.331 --> 15:49.265
you might consider,
just this once,

15:49.266 --> 15:52.569
using your genitalia to
actually accomplish something!

15:55.139 --> 15:56.973
He still won't shag
the old lady, huh?

15:56.974 --> 16:00.210
No. But thank you for asking.

16:03.079 --> 16:04.413
Hey. Hi.

16:04.414 --> 16:05.948
Hello, Leonard.

16:05.949 --> 16:07.483
I hope you're hungry.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.251
I'm very hungry.

16:09.252 --> 16:11.920
For food, right?

16:11.921 --> 16:14.423
Oh, I made you uncomfortable
last night.

16:14.424 --> 16:16.258
I'm so sorry.

16:16.259 --> 16:17.560
No, that's okay.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.494
No, it most
certainly is not.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.730
Leonard, I'm making the
donation to your department

16:21.731 --> 16:24.032
regardless of what
happens between us.

16:24.033 --> 16:26.101
- Really?
- Well, of course.

16:26.102 --> 16:27.970
There's no quid
pro quo here.

16:27.971 --> 16:29.972
You and your colleagues are
doing remarkable research,

16:29.973 --> 16:31.706
and you deserve the money.

16:31.707 --> 16:33.408
Oh.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.843
Then what was
last night about?

16:35.844 --> 16:38.946
I took a shot; sue me.

16:38.947 --> 16:41.448
Oh.

16:41.449 --> 16:43.351
You're a very
handsome man, Leonard.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.921
Thank you.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.223
It was foolish of me to
think someone your age

16:50.224 --> 16:52.792
might ever be interested
in someone like me.

16:52.793 --> 16:54.127
Oh, don't say that.

16:54.128 --> 16:55.996
- You're a very attractive woman.
- Oh, please.

16:55.997 --> 16:58.965
- No, it's true.
- Well, aren't you sweet.

16:58.966 --> 17:01.268
Just for the record...

17:01.269 --> 17:04.771
you'd remember a night with me
for the rest of your life.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.875
I'm sure I would.

17:09.876 --> 17:12.810
But why-why, exactly?

17:12.811 --> 17:14.846
You're a very smart man.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.749
How do you think I landed
such a rich husband?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.219
I hadn't really
given it much thought.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.154
Well, think about it.

17:24.924 --> 17:26.958
Do you mean...?

17:26.959 --> 17:29.294
Yep. I'm that good.

17:33.332 --> 17:35.333
Oh, what the hell.

17:50.148 --> 17:52.983
Good morning, slut.

17:55.452 --> 17:57.519
What?

17:57.520 --> 18:01.290
Oh, please, I recognize
the walk of shame
when I see it.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.392
All you're missing is
a little smeared mascara

18:03.393 --> 18:05.694
and a purse with panties
wadded up in it.

18:05.695 --> 18:07.363
What's
going on?

18:07.364 --> 18:08.697
Oh, nothing's going on.

18:08.698 --> 18:09.798
Excuse me.

18:09.799 --> 18:11.666
- Are you just getting home?
- Yeah.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.469
That's a good sign, right?

18:14.470 --> 18:15.603
Oh, yeah.

18:15.604 --> 18:18.273
I'm so proud of you!

18:18.274 --> 18:19.441
You sold yourself out

18:19.442 --> 18:21.609
like a common streetwalker!

18:21.610 --> 18:25.480
No, I didn't do it
for the money.

18:25.481 --> 18:27.514
She stiffed you?

18:27.515 --> 18:30.384
I believe that's what
your roommate did to her.

18:30.385 --> 18:32.353
What?!

18:32.354 --> 18:35.022
Again, read the
book we gave you.

18:35.023 --> 18:36.756
No, I mean,

18:36.757 --> 18:38.692
I-I got the money first.

18:38.693 --> 18:40.127
Smart. Get paid up front.

18:40.128 --> 18:43.463
Yeah, I think you have a real
knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

18:43.464 --> 18:45.131
Uh...

18:45.132 --> 18:47.000
I'm gonna go lie down.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.202
That's a good idea;
get your rest.

18:49.203 --> 18:51.304
There are a lot more
rich old ladies out there,

18:51.305 --> 18:52.905
and Daddy needs
a new linear accelerator.

18:55.942 --> 19:00.345
And I thought he didn't learn anything
from his relationship with you.

19:00.346 --> 19:02.580
Hey!

19:02.581 --> 19:03.615
Another compliment!

19:03.616 --> 19:04.949
Learn to recognize them.

19:11.315 --> 19:12.981
Ah, there he is!

19:12.982 --> 19:14.483
The man of the hour!

19:14.484 --> 19:16.151
He took one for the team!

19:19.388 --> 19:22.390
I didn't do it
for the money!

19:22.391 --> 19:25.927
Keep telling yourself that--
it makes it easier.

19:25.928 --> 19:28.296
Trust me, I know.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.766
Cool, buddy!
That's awesome!
Yeah!

19:31.767 --> 19:33.568
