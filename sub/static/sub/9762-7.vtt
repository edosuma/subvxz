WEBVTT

00:08.926 --> 00:13.636
The Tenkaichi Budokai
is drawing close at hand.

00:13.847 --> 00:19.183
Gohan was teaching Goten and Videl
the Bukujutsu flying technique.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.312
Isn't that amazing?!

00:23.524 --> 00:26.186
Imagine, being able to float after just one day!

00:26.402 --> 00:27.983
Oh, I don't know...

00:28.195 --> 00:30.857
I did it! I did it! Big Brother!

00:31.073 --> 00:35.863
Meanwhile, Vegeta and Trunks'
training continued

00:36.078 --> 00:38.364
inside the gravity control room.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.994
It's too hard like this, all right.
Time to turn Super Saiyan!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.334
Y-You've got to be kidding!

00:46.547 --> 00:51.382
He became a warrior of legend,
a Super Saiyan, as easily as that?!

00:56.515 --> 00:59.848
Okay, let's pick up where we left off yesterday.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.773 --> 02:34.269
"The Dragon Team Fully Assembled!
Son Goku Has Come Back!!"

02:40.661 --> 02:44.620
Look at me! I've gotten
so I can hover quite well!

02:44.832 --> 02:48.199
Good, good! You've got it down perfectly!

02:48.418 --> 02:49.498
At the pace you're going,

02:49.711 --> 02:53.169
I don't think there's anything
more I can teach you, is there?

03:04.977 --> 03:08.595
Say, how many days will it take
until I can fly like that?

03:08.814 --> 03:12.807
Huh? W-Well, that's a
good question. I don't know.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.768
I'm planning on coming here
every day until I can.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.780
J-Just a moment.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.736
Big Brother, look at me! See?

03:34.172 --> 03:37.960
Goten, please! Don't fly any
faster while Videl-san is here!

03:38.176 --> 03:39.632
Hmm? Why not?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.006
It doesn't matter why not, okay?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.723
Uh-huh.

03:43.932 --> 03:44.842
What?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.640
Oh, nothing. Just a little advice.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.682
Time for a short breather.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.109
You know, while I'm thinking of it,

03:57.321 --> 04:00.233
don't tell Papa that I'm doing
special flying training here.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.486
I'm planning to surprise him by
revealing it to him at the matches.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.034
Oh, you don't say.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.202
Mm-hmm, that might be best.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.157
Besides, if Papa found out
l was going to a boy's house,

04:11.376 --> 04:15.710
there'd be trouble. He's terribly
overprotective of me, after all.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.584
Listen to me, Videl!

04:17.798 --> 04:22.463
You are not allowed to go out with
any boy who isn't stronger than me!

04:24.139 --> 04:27.472
But there's no way there are
any boys in the world like that.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.061
Papa is the world champion, after all.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.182
Although, Gohan-kun,
you're on the right track.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.185
Even so, I doubt you're any match for Papa.

04:37.361 --> 04:41.479
S-Say, do you and your father spar a lot?

04:41.698 --> 04:47.159
Huh? Spar? There's no way we'd
do that, is there? He's the champion.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.078
He hasn't even been
coaching drills with me lately.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.530
So I'm doing my own thing.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.584
Yeah, I knew it. Videl-san hasn't realized it.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.254
She's already far stronger than Mister Satan is.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.800
S-Say, I'll bet if your father lost to anyone,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.924
it would be, you know, shocking, right?

05:07.140 --> 05:11.349
No, it wouldn't. Papa's been
pushing his luck too far.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.553
I don't care if Mama has passed away--

05:14.773 --> 05:18.812
he shouldn't use being the champion
to fool around with all kinds of women.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.983
It would do him good to get beaten once.

05:21.196 --> 05:26.816
Okay! Okay! Videl-san won't
be hurt if I beat Mister Satan!

05:27.035 --> 05:29.526
Well, should we get back to it?

05:32.624 --> 05:37.118
Gohan-kun, come to think of it,
who taught you the martial arts?

05:38.422 --> 05:43.291
Oh, a friend of mine,
and my late father, and so forth.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.547
Hmm. Your father must have
been pretty strong, right?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.503
Mm-hmm, he was incredibly strong.

05:48.724 --> 05:52.637
Hey, you know what? Father is
entering this Tenkaichi Budokai,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.514
so he's coming back for one day!

05:54.730 --> 05:59.349
Huh? He's coming back? What do you mean?

05:59.568 --> 06:00.853
He's dead, right?

06:01.069 --> 06:05.688
Goten, you dummy! I told you
not to say that, didn't I?!

06:05.907 --> 06:12.619
Oh, I get it! I'll bet your father
ran out on you long ago, right?

06:12.831 --> 06:14.947
But he secretly contacted just the two of you,

06:15.167 --> 06:18.000
saying he'd be entering the
tournament. That's it, right?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.542
U-Uh...

06:19.755 --> 06:23.373
Mm-hmm. Our parents give
both of us trouble, don't they?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.332
Y-Yeah...

06:25.552 --> 06:29.170
Okay, let's forget about them,
and get back to training!

06:29.389 --> 06:31.926
And so, several days later...

06:38.356 --> 06:40.267
Watch out, watch out!

06:42.527 --> 06:45.360
Videl-san is something special, after all.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.360
In only ten days, she's gotten
so she can fly pretty freely.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.903
Mm-hmm, you really have passed now.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.623
There's nothing more I can teach you.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.665
Thank you, Gohan-kun.
Now I can devote myself

06:58.877 --> 07:01.493
to my Tenkaichi Budokai training
without any reservations.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.704
Yeah, me too.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.381
Well, l have to get home.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.710
Oh, yeah. I can just fly there like this, can't I?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.511
Mm-hmm.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.681
Okay, see you at the tournament. Goodbye!

07:14.893 --> 07:16.633
--Good bye!
--Good bye!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.225
Big Brother, she finally left, huh?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.817
Yeah.

07:23.026 --> 07:27.986
Goten, now we can train!
We have to make up for the time we lost!

07:28.198 --> 07:30.814
--Uh-huh!
--Okay, come on, Goten!

07:33.620 --> 07:37.408
The Tenkaichi Budokai draws ever nearer,

07:37.624 --> 07:42.994
and everyone knuckles down on
each of their final training regimens.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.249
Including Vegeta...

07:45.465 --> 07:47.421
9,993...

07:47.634 --> 07:49.374
9,994...

07:49.594 --> 07:51.505
9,995...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.973
9,996...

07:54.182 --> 07:55.797
...and Piccolo...

08:22.878 --> 08:24.709
...and Kuririn...

08:27.174 --> 08:31.338
You get married, and the pressure
sure does mount, huh?

08:34.597 --> 08:38.636
W-What incredible zeal Videl-san has...

08:38.852 --> 08:41.719
It looks like she's gotten
much stronger than before.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.693
Change that for a new one, will you?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.778
Y-Yeah...

09:01.374 --> 09:02.534
Papa”.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.241
Yeah, Videl?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.543
Are you sure you shouldn't be training?

09:06.755 --> 09:10.964
There's no need. You can take
your papa's victory to the bank.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.337
I'll run away with it!

09:49.714 --> 09:53.832
It's no use... I'm just no
match for you, Big Brother...

09:54.052 --> 09:57.419
That's because I've been training
a lot longer than you, Goten.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.180
But you're pretty good, too.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.015
|s Father really coming to the tournament?

10:06.231 --> 10:09.723
Goten, this will be your first time
meeting Father, huh?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.433
You must be looking forward to it.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.238
Uh-huh.

10:16.992 --> 10:22.737
Where is Goku, anyway? It's almost
time for the tournament to begin.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.288
Goku is up there.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.960
He just finished all of his training,
and is calming his mind.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.271
Hey, do you think Son-kun will really be there?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.439
He's coming for sure.

10:52.652 --> 10:58.363
Wow. How long has it been since
we've seen Goku? I can't wait.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.533
Indeed, it really has been a long time.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.453
I'm glad that everyone is doin' so well.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.202
Yamucha-san, you're not enterin'?

11:08.418 --> 11:12.582
There's no way I could.
I'd just embarrass myself.

11:12.797 --> 11:18.042
I'll bet with your hair like that,
Father won't realize it's you, Kuririn-san.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.297
You're probably right.

11:20.513 --> 11:25.348
By the way, Vegeta-san...
and also, Goten and Trunks-kun,

11:25.560 --> 11:29.724
can we agree not to turn Super Saiyan
during the tournament?

11:29.939 --> 11:30.974
Why not?

11:31.191 --> 11:36.561
Don't you know? You showed up
on TV during the Cell Games,

11:36.780 --> 11:39.943
so people will already be thinking,
"I've seen them somewhere before."

11:40.158 --> 11:43.616
I just dare you to turn
Super Saiyan on top of that.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.070
Then they'll think,
"Ah, it's those guys from back then!"

11:47.290 --> 11:51.954
Yes. And if that happens, there will
definitely be a fuss on TV and stuff.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.913
Hmph, I could just blow those guys away.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.090
No, we can't have you doing that.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.011
Well, okay, fine. As long as
no one turns Super Saiyan,

12:03.223 --> 12:07.136
the conditions will be the same.
It won't change my dominance.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.513
--That'S okay with us, too.
--Uh-huh!

12:09.729 --> 12:12.186
Good. Thanks, everyone.

12:12.399 --> 12:17.143
That helps me out, too.
That stuff isn't playing fair!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.856
Ah! There it is, there it is!

12:23.076 --> 12:26.910
That's the island with the
Tenkaichi Budokai grounds.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.702
Okay, we're almost there.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.251
Now then, I have to get ready.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.550
Yeah. I can't let the others
at school know who I am, after all.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.505
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.511
Y-Yeah...

12:49.727 --> 12:51.228
Mm-hmm!

13:13.585 --> 13:16.372
Hey, man, there sure are
a lot of people here, huh?

13:16.588 --> 13:19.170
That's the truth. Ah, what a pain.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.714
I wonder if Goku is here already.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.376
--What is it?
--|t's Mister Satan!

13:24.596 --> 13:26.257
Mister Satan is giving autographs!

13:26.473 --> 13:27.929
Mister Satan, huh?

13:28.141 --> 13:28.971
I'm getting his autograph!

13:29.184 --> 13:32.142
Sounds like the hero
who saved the world is here.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.935
That guy is incredibly popular, huh?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.764
Nobody knows what really happened, after all.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.350
Videl-san's father, huh?

13:52.999 --> 13:57.493
Satan fans the world over,
thank you for waiting!

13:57.712 --> 13:59.213
Mister Satan, welcome.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.164
What do you think your chances
of winning this tournament are?

14:03.426 --> 14:07.635
Well, frankly, my odds of winning
are about 120 percent!

14:07.847 --> 14:10.964
I understand your daughter is
entering this tournament, as well.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.347
Did you cut your hair as a
gesture of your enthusiasm?

14:14.562 --> 14:17.395
You're bothering me. Leave me alone.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.974
It's mine, all mine!

14:22.403 --> 14:24.655
Same old fellow as ever, huh?

14:24.864 --> 14:28.903
Pay him no mind, pay him no mind.
By the way, is Father here yet?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.370
I don't see him anywhere.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.118
Big Brother, it's Piccolo-san!

14:36.334 --> 14:38.325
Oh, you're right!

14:40.004 --> 14:44.043
Piccolo-san, have you seen Father anywhere?

14:44.259 --> 14:47.171
Oh, Gohan. No, I haven't.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.221
Hold on, are you going to enter in that outfit?

14:51.432 --> 14:52.933
Of course.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.725
What could have happened to Goku-5a?

14:56.938 --> 14:59.395
Has he already gone to the
contestant changing room?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.472
All right, I'll go look.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.183
Yeah, me too.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.281
Yoo-hoo!

15:07.490 --> 15:08.696
Father!

15:08.908 --> 15:09.943
Goku!

15:10.159 --> 15:11.945
H-Hey!

15:12.161 --> 15:15.119
You all look so different!

15:15.331 --> 15:18.664
So then... how have you been?

15:25.300 --> 15:28.337
G... Goku-5a!

15:31.014 --> 15:33.721
Welcome back!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.469
Son-kun...

15:35.685 --> 15:37.516
G-G-Goku...

15:37.729 --> 15:39.845
G-Goku!

15:46.529 --> 15:47.735
--Goku!
--Father!

15:47.947 --> 15:50.984
Goku-5a! I've been waitin' for you!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.191
I missed you, too.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.111
Goten, it's your father!

15:57.332 --> 16:02.372
Wah! I thought he looked just like me!
That's my kid, after all?!

16:05.590 --> 16:07.296
Father...?

16:20.271 --> 16:22.512
Father!

16:22.732 --> 16:26.224
You sure are spirited, huh?
Looks like you're strong, like me.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.271
Terrific!

16:38.706 --> 16:40.822
Goku...

16:41.042 --> 16:44.910
Okay, you've got 24 hours. Got it?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.211
Mm-hmm. Understood.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.924
See you.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.964
Thank you, Uranai Baba!

16:51.177 --> 16:54.294
Hey, we have to hurry and
sign in for the tournament,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.971
or we'll miss the cutoff.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.720
Huh? G-Great...?

16:59.936 --> 17:01.642
Great Saiyaman.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.594
Great Saiyaman?

17:03.815 --> 17:04.679
That's right.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.935
Eh? What's with that?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.608
My name and outfit are awfully neat, huh?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.278
Y-Yeah, they are.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.650
Okay, next.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.612
Let's see, you're in the junior division.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.663
Huh?! The junior division?!

17:22.875 --> 17:26.083
Little boys up to age 15
are in the junior division.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.957
Hey, Goten, they say they're not
letting anyone under 15 years old

17:29.173 --> 17:30.754
in with the adults.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.177
Oh, is that something they do now?
This is getting complicated.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.802
Never mind about that!
Let us compete with the adults!

17:40.017 --> 17:43.305
No, no! It's against the rules, so no way!

17:43.521 --> 17:45.227
Tch, that's no fun!

17:46.691 --> 17:51.526
All contestants, please go inside
the changing area at once.

17:52.196 --> 17:52.981
"Spectator Seating"
"Contestants' Changing Area"

17:53.239 --> 17:56.777
Good luck, Goku-sa, Gohan, and Goten!

17:56.993 --> 17:59.325
Go earn us a whole heap of prize money!

17:59.537 --> 18:00.617
Right!

18:00.830 --> 18:04.368
Okay then, for the first time in ages,
I'm gonna go wild!

18:04.584 --> 18:07.951
I'm going to have to show Father
how strong I've gotten.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.786
I'm not gonna hold back, okay?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.542
Me neither!

18:12.675 --> 18:15.337
Dad's going to go give it
his all now. Wait for me.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.009
Mm-hmm!

18:17.221 --> 18:19.052
We're off!

18:19.265 --> 18:21.677
Go easy on them, everyone!

18:21.893 --> 18:23.474
Good luck!

18:48.503 --> 18:50.084
Make way, make way!

18:54.509 --> 18:56.750
Hi! Where are you from?

18:56.969 --> 19:01.713
I'm from Satan City. I may not look it,
but I train at Satan Dojo.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.973
I wonder if Gohan-kun is here yet.

19:12.944 --> 19:17.278
Hey, Goten, your dead old man
looks just like you.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.696
You think so?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.364
He was awesome, right?

19:20.576 --> 19:21.361
Uh-huh.

19:21.577 --> 19:26.822
It doesn't look like it to me.
My dad looks stronger.

19:27.041 --> 19:31.159
But Big Brother said Father
was the strongest in the universe.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.546
I thought you were bald.

19:35.758 --> 19:40.218
I told you a long time ago
that I shaved it, right?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.294
Why did you grow it out?

19:42.515 --> 19:45.302
I think you look better with no hair.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.635
Well, you see, a lot has happened.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.097
Huh? No. 18! Ain't that No. 18?!

19:53.276 --> 19:56.109
You just now noticed? Dummy.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.812
What's No. 18 doing here?!

20:00.032 --> 20:03.490
She and I live together at
Muten Roshi-sama's place.

20:03.703 --> 20:08.743
Eh?! You mean, Kuririn, you and No. 18 are...

20:08.958 --> 20:12.496
We have a child, too. You saw
her earlier, remember? The girl.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.624
Huh?! Th-That's astonishing!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.421
Dummy!

20:18.593 --> 20:21.300
You had a child with her,
even though she's a robot?

20:21.512 --> 20:24.800
She's not a robot! No. 18 used to be a human.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.257
She was just reconstructed a little bit.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.808
Oh, really? Kuririn, congratulations.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.977
Th-Thanks.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.850
Gohan-kun, that's you, right?

20:35.151 --> 20:37.233
--Videl-san...
--I knew it!

20:37.445 --> 20:39.561
Gohan-kun, why are you dressed like that?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.281
Shh!

20:42.700 --> 20:45.612
I'm the Great Saiyaman.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.568
Ah, so that's it.

20:47.788 --> 20:51.121
So, Videl-san, have you gotten
so you can fly like a pro?

20:51.334 --> 20:53.450
Of course! Watch!

21:15.191 --> 21:18.274
Hey, Gohan-kun,
I'm not going to hold back, okay?

21:18.486 --> 21:20.192
My arch-rival, huh?

21:20.404 --> 21:24.943
At last, Son Goku returns from the Next World.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.242
The Dragon Team is all assembled, and now,

21:28.454 --> 21:33.414
a new Tenkaichi Budokai is about to begin!

22:41.902 --> 22:43.358
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.571 --> 22:45.903
Okay, it's almost time for the first round.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.106
All right, everyone, let's get revved up and go!

22:48.325 --> 22:51.192
Hmph, this is rubbish!
I'm going to smash this thing!

22:51.412 --> 22:52.652
What are we going to do about you?

22:52.872 --> 22:56.330
Ah, it sounds like the junior
division is about to start.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.282
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.502 --> 23:01.710
"Who is the World's Greatest?!
The Tournament Preliminaries Begin!!"

23:01.922 --> 23:05.210
For crying out loud,
this is all nothing but nonsense!
