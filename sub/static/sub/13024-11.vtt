01:09.370 --> 01:11.080
Pidge, scan the download from the ship.

01:11.163 --> 01:13.290
Find out where Zarkon's
central command is.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.708
On it!

01:14.792 --> 01:16.627
What happened?
Where's Allura?

01:16.710 --> 01:20.339
They captured her. She sacrificed herself
to save me and the information.

01:20.422 --> 01:23.133
- I didn't have a choice.
- How is that possible?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.678
Coran, I'm sorry things
didn't go as planned,

01:25.761 --> 01:27.721
but we can't focus on what went wrong.

01:27.805 --> 01:30.975
We've got to figure out how
to make it right. Pidge, anything?

01:31.058 --> 01:32.601
Guys, look at this.

01:35.145 --> 01:37.064
Look at the size of it!

01:37.147 --> 01:39.400
I think we should go in right away.

01:39.483 --> 01:42.528
Every minute we waste
gives Zarkon time to prepare for us.

01:42.611 --> 01:47.533
I agree. We form Voltron, fly in, fly out,
dust off our hands, and walk away.

01:47.616 --> 01:52.079
Um, do you guys not remember the Balmera?
We could barely take out one fleet.

01:52.162 --> 01:55.207
But this... a base this size could hold
a thousand fleets!

01:55.291 --> 01:59.211
Or maybe we shouldn't go
on this mission at all. Think about it.

01:59.295 --> 02:01.297
We'll be delivering
the universe's only hope

02:01.380 --> 02:03.257
to the universe's biggest enemy.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.218
Keith, that's cold, even for you.

02:06.302 --> 02:09.179
What if it was one of us?
What if it was me?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.098
You wouldn't leave me, would you?

02:11.181 --> 02:12.308
Would you?

02:12.391 --> 02:16.228
I'm not saying I like the idea.
I'm just thinking like a paladin.

02:16.312 --> 02:19.690
No, you're thinking of yourself because
you're too scared to do what's right!

02:19.773 --> 02:22.401
Okay, we're all upset
because we lost Allura.

02:22.484 --> 02:24.695
No, Shiro lost Allura!

02:24.778 --> 02:27.323
Okay, okay! This isn't helping.

02:27.406 --> 02:29.575
We can't just sit here
and bicker like this.

02:30.909 --> 02:35.080
Let's focus.
How are we going to get Allura?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.777
Come with me.

03:07.905 --> 03:08.906
Anything?

03:08.989 --> 03:12.576
There's just no way in. They'll have us
tracked from every direction.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.329
There's got to be something.
Keep looking.

03:24.129 --> 03:28.342
I know you're worried about her.
We all are.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.552
I'm sorry I let her slip away.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.263
I know it's not your fault.

03:33.347 --> 03:37.726
It's just... I've already lost so much.
I can't lose Allura, too.

03:37.810 --> 03:40.229
We'll find a way to get her back.

03:40.312 --> 03:44.066
If there was just a way to get close
to Zarkon's ship unseen...

03:44.149 --> 03:47.194
Wait a tick. I think I've got a way.

04:11.176 --> 04:13.303
Princess Allura.

04:15.597 --> 04:18.934
You monster! You destroyed Altea!

04:25.899 --> 04:29.403
Voltron is going to put an end
to your empire!

04:30.112 --> 04:36.869
No, it will only make me more powerful.
Your father knew that as well as I.

04:36.952 --> 04:41.290
That's why he led me to believe
he destroyed it all those years ago.

04:41.373 --> 04:44.460
But now, your new paladins
will come for you,

04:44.543 --> 04:47.463
and they will deliver Voltron to me,

04:47.546 --> 04:52.259
and, with it,
the key to unimaginable power.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.971
<i>Everyone, eyes front.</i>

04:56.054 --> 04:57.765
We've got a plan to get Allura.

04:57.848 --> 05:00.976
We're going to jump to the heart
of the enemy, unseen and undetected.

05:01.059 --> 05:03.604
I thought we needed Allura
to open up a wormhole.

05:03.687 --> 05:07.858
It's true that Allura powers the Castle's
ability to travel through wormholes.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.528
However, I think we have enough of her
residual essence stored in the system

05:11.612 --> 05:13.155
to make one jump.

05:13.238 --> 05:14.531
We'll hide the Castle here,

05:14.615 --> 05:18.035
inside one of these giant gas planets
in Zarkon's command system.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.204
The gas is so dense, we'll be hidden.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.415
From there, we'll use the Castle
to scan for Allura on Zarkon's ship

05:23.499 --> 05:25.542
and attack before Zarkon knows
what hit him.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.462
There's only one hiccup.
We have enough energy to wormhole in,

05:28.545 --> 05:31.507
but, without Allura, we won't have
enough energy to wormhole out.

05:31.590 --> 05:35.260
It doesn't matter.
We're not leaving without her.

05:36.345 --> 05:39.932
Sire, allow me to send my fleet
to protect the command system.

05:40.015 --> 05:42.434
I will stop Voltron
before it can get close.

05:42.518 --> 05:48.273
You will do no such thing, Prorok.
We will allow them inside our perimeter.

05:48.357 --> 05:51.151
Once in, they won't get out.

05:51.235 --> 05:56.907
Ready all fleets. On this day,
the paladins will be destroyed,

05:56.990 --> 05:59.576
and I will have Voltron.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.590
We're here.

06:20.764 --> 06:22.891
I'm detecting
Allura's energy signature.

06:22.975 --> 06:24.810
From this distance,
the signal's pretty weak,

06:24.893 --> 06:26.937
but she's somewhere
in Zarkon's main ship.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.397
Gives us a starting point.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.358
Once we get closer,
we'll be able to narrow down the location

06:31.441 --> 06:32.985
where the Princess is being held.

06:33.068 --> 06:37.447
Okay, guys, this is it. Voltron is going
to come in fast and without warning.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.200
We'll smash our way into Zarkon's ship
and grab the Princess.

06:40.284 --> 06:43.912
Before they know what hit them,
we'll have the Princess and be on our way.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.682
Emperor, we're detecting Voltron
within our perimeter!

07:45.766 --> 07:48.810
Engage the solar barrier
immediately. Attack!

07:48.894 --> 07:50.228
Yes, Emperor.

08:01.156 --> 08:04.201
- Thace, scramble the fighters!
- Yes, Commander.

08:07.579 --> 08:10.040
Haggar, it is time.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.171
- What is that?
- I don't know,

08:16.254 --> 08:20.092
but I hope once we get the Princess,
we can find a way out of here.

08:21.593 --> 08:22.803
They're going to fire!

08:34.690 --> 08:35.732
Form sword!

09:11.893 --> 09:13.311
More trouble, straight ahead!

09:16.606 --> 09:18.358
Form shoulder cannon!

09:44.009 --> 09:45.469
There's Zarkon's ship!

09:54.227 --> 09:55.437
What's going on?

09:55.520 --> 09:58.356
We lost the sword!
Something's malfunctioning!

09:58.440 --> 09:59.524
What's happening?

09:59.608 --> 10:02.069
<i>Somebody do something!
Voltron's frozen up!</i>

10:02.152 --> 10:05.572
- Shiro!
- I can't hold it!

10:16.374 --> 10:19.586
<i>You're a fool to bring Voltron here.</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:28.762
What just happened there?
Something tore us apart!

10:28.845 --> 10:31.848
I don't know, but we've got
bigger problems right now. Look!

10:33.642 --> 10:36.770
Why do I get the feeling
these guys knew we were coming?

11:19.062 --> 11:20.856
There's no end to these guys!

11:25.735 --> 11:29.364
Coran attack! I've waited
ten thousand years for this!

11:51.219 --> 11:53.388
Shiro, are you okay?

11:54.931 --> 11:58.727
Something is overriding the controls!
My lion is not responding!

12:01.146 --> 12:03.565
Shiro's in trouble!
I'm going in!

12:08.486 --> 12:11.990
<i>You cannot fight it.
Your connection is weak.</i>

12:46.524 --> 12:47.984
What do we do now, guys?

12:48.068 --> 12:51.321
Our plan isn't really working out
as... well, planned!

12:51.404 --> 12:55.408
I'm going for the Black Lion.
You guys get the Princess, now!

12:55.492 --> 12:59.704
I've identified Allura's exact location.
Uploading the coordinates to you, now.

12:59.788 --> 13:03.166
In the meantime,
I'll provide covering fire from out here,

13:03.249 --> 13:06.127
all alone, against an entire fleet.

13:06.211 --> 13:08.546
So, yeah, do you mind hurrying?

13:09.255 --> 13:12.300
My jetpack's damaged.
I'll need to go through the ship.

13:25.355 --> 13:27.273
You guys get
the Princess without me.

13:27.357 --> 13:29.150
What? We've got to stick together!

13:29.234 --> 13:31.611
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I can.

14:28.293 --> 14:30.170
Whoa! Who is that?

14:31.296 --> 14:33.089
It's Zarkon!

14:33.173 --> 14:36.885
Keith, get out of there, now!
Zarkon's too powerful!

14:36.968 --> 14:42.098
This is my chance to put an end
to the Galra Empire! I have to take it!

14:44.225 --> 14:45.685
<i>Keith, don't!</i>

14:56.988 --> 14:59.199
You may have a lion,

14:59.282 --> 15:03.370
but its power is weak
in your fledgling hands.

15:21.679 --> 15:23.598
You cannot stop me.

15:23.681 --> 15:28.144
The Black Lion will finally be
returned to its original paladin.

15:34.984 --> 15:38.113
So, Champion returns.

15:38.196 --> 15:39.531
You!

15:57.632 --> 15:58.466
This is it!

15:58.550 --> 16:01.970
- The Princess is in this part of the ship!
- How do we get in?

16:02.053 --> 16:04.347
Maybe I can try hacking
one of their cargo bays.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.142
- We don't have time for that!
- Do you have a better idea?

16:07.225 --> 16:08.685
Actually, yes, I do.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.354
Huh?

16:22.824 --> 16:25.618
Sir, the hull's been breached.
It's one of the lions.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.579
Focus fighters on that quadrant.

16:29.831 --> 16:32.375
Looks like we've got to cover Hunk's butt!

16:32.459 --> 16:34.878
- Hunk!
- We're going to get you out of here.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.463
What are you doing here?

16:36.546 --> 16:40.383
Tell me you didn't bring Voltron
straight to Zarkon's central command!

16:40.467 --> 16:41.759
Where's the Black Lion?

16:43.678 --> 16:46.973
<i>- We have to save Shiro!
- Hunk, did you get the Princess?</i>

16:47.056 --> 16:49.267
I got her, but there's a change of plans.

16:50.518 --> 16:53.938
I made you strong
and this is how you repay me?

16:58.359 --> 17:01.362
You could have been our greatest weapon.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.752
Now, I will destroy you.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.354
Keith, get out of there!

18:27.031 --> 18:28.324
<i>Keith, do you copy?</i>

18:29.158 --> 18:31.869
<i>You don't know what you're dealing with!
He's too powerful!</i>

18:31.953 --> 18:34.706
<i>Listen to me, it's imperative
that you don't engage the...</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:08.281
No!

19:36.809 --> 19:37.935
Whoa!

19:46.486 --> 19:49.030
You fight like a Galra soldier.

19:49.113 --> 19:51.282
But not for long!

20:05.797 --> 20:10.176
And, now, Champion, 
your time is over.

20:11.886 --> 20:14.305
Which one's the real one?

20:16.933 --> 20:18.851
Hunk, there! Fire!

20:27.360 --> 20:30.488
- We've got to get out of here!
- Where's the scary lady?

20:30.571 --> 20:32.115
- Hunk!
- Oh, right.

20:40.748 --> 20:43.209
Come on! Come on!

20:54.178 --> 20:55.555
I got you, buddy!

21:15.783 --> 21:18.077
All right, Paladins,
time to get out of here!

21:19.620 --> 21:22.331
<i>Hello? What's going on?
I don't see a wormhole.</i>

21:22.415 --> 21:25.460
The Galra barrier is jamming
our ability to create one!

21:26.377 --> 21:29.172
Send in everything we've got!
Corner them!

21:33.009 --> 21:34.761
This sector is off limits.

21:51.486 --> 21:54.322
<i>They have us
completely surrounded!</i>

22:05.124 --> 22:08.085
<i>- What just happened?
- Who cares? Wormhole!</i>

22:28.356 --> 22:29.690
Coran, what's happening?

22:29.774 --> 22:31.776
The integrity of the wormhole
has been compromised.

22:31.859 --> 22:33.986
- It's breaking down!
- What does that mean?

22:34.070 --> 22:36.489
It means we have no control
over where we're headed!
