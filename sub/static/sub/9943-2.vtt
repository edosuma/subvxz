Now, nobody's saying the Chatsworth
Estate is the Garden of Eden.

00:05.580 --> 00:09.019
But it's been a good home to us,
to me, Frank Gallagher,

00:09.020 --> 00:11.339
and me kids, who I'm proud of.

00:11.340 --> 00:15.339
Cos every single one of them
reminds me a little of me.

00:15.780 --> 00:19.779
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.499
Quick, leg it!

00:21.500 --> 00:23.899
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why

00:23.900 --> 00:26.539
nobody calls him Philip anymore.

00:26.540 --> 00:29.219
Ian, a lot like his mam,
which is handy,

00:29.220 --> 00:31.419
cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:31.420 --> 00:35.419
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons.

00:35.620 --> 00:39.619
One, it stands on end and makes him
look like Toyah. Two, nits love it.

You have to check your change

00:44.740 --> 00:48.739
but she'll go miles out of her way
to do you a favour.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.059
Plus lickle Liam.
He's going to be a star some day.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.499
Wicked!

00:53.500 --> 00:55.739
Sheila, me bird.
Couldn't be happier.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.059
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.659
Carol and Marty,
the lodgers from hell.

01:01.660 --> 01:05.019
Last of the lonely hearts
and a psychologist's wet dream.

01:05.019 --> 01:07.259
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:07.260 --> 01:10.179
But all of them to a man know
first and foremost

01:10.180 --> 01:13.299
one of the most vital necessities
in life.

02:05.140 --> 02:07.219
Couldn't find the
child benefit book.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.739
Shall we go to the pub?

02:08.740 --> 02:11.019
Yeah? All right.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.019
Come on, come on.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.739
They're all so grown up now.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.659
Hardly recognised 'em.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.539
Yeah, well, it's been hard for me.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.059
Responsibility
for all of them on my own.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.419
It's kind of weighed heavily.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.419
Yeah, but I'm back now, Frank.

02:52.420 --> 02:56.419
To lighten your load.

You all right, Sheila?
You remember Monica, don't you?

03:33.060 --> 03:37.059
She's come...you know,
she's come to see the kids.

03:37.940 --> 03:41.939
Yes.
You told me, Frank.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.939
Brought your cigarettes.
Would you like a drink?

03:44.940 --> 03:48.139
Yeah, another vodka tonic, thanks.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.379
Oh, yeah, right, course I did.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.539
Cos you asked me that
about when she...and I said...

03:53.540 --> 03:55.539
Yeah, of course, yeah.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.339
That'll be two vodka tonics, please.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.859
Fancy that.
Same poison.

04:00.860 --> 04:04.859
And I'll just have
a couple of Es, Jess.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.019
Do any of yous lot
know how this works?

04:12.020 --> 04:13.779
That's disgusting.

04:13.780 --> 04:14.859
What is it?

04:14.860 --> 04:17.858
It's a balloon pump.

04:17.860 --> 04:21.219
Sorry, have we not met?
I'm your neighbour.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.219
I want some help blowing these up.
It isn't a fucking request.

04:28.820 --> 04:31.219
You wouldn't be our neighbour,

04:31.220 --> 04:33.459
if you hadn't stolen my daughter's
house.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.979
Like you give a shit.
Nearly pulled a muscle

04:35.980 --> 04:38.059
scavenging gear
for your own back.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.259
I'm keeping it for her.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.379
Oh, yeah, and I'm the Queen of Sheba.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.819
You two better get a rocket up your
arse. Got to be there for one.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.299

What are you looking at, you perv?

05:38.060 --> 05:41.979
Sign there, love.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.539
Ta. See you in a couple of days.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.539
Yeah.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.179
I need to go!

05:54.180 --> 05:55.379
It's not my problem, Norma.

05:55.380 --> 05:58.339
You can't do this! There's such
a thing as human rights.

05:58.340 --> 06:01.139
I'm entitled to a toilet.
Where's Mon? She'll let us.

06:01.140 --> 06:02.139
Gone out.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.979
Which is exactly what you should
be doing, Norma. Going home.

06:05.980 --> 06:09.019
Unless you want to pay rent
for sleeping in the Dormobile.

06:09.020 --> 06:13.019
Where's she gone?
She's never up before 11.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.139
Look, Debbie,
I'm gonna piss myself.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.299
Look at you.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.979
Makes a mother so proud.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.019
You look like a stiff in a body bag.

06:29.020 --> 06:32.659
Straighten your face or our Jamie
will put you in a fucking body bag!

06:32.660 --> 06:36.139
Pack it in, you two. Micky,
reminds me of your first communion.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.019
Right, when he comes out,
don't overcrowd him, OK?

06:39.020 --> 06:41.739
What did you make us all
fucking come for, then?!

06:41.740 --> 06:44.179
Oi, watch your mouth,
fucking gobshite!

06:44.180 --> 06:47.859
So he knows we appreciate him.
And what he's done for us.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.019
And how much we love him.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.779
Where is he, then?
I haven't fed my snake yet.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.579
Jesus!

06:52.580 --> 06:56.579
Can't we just ask somebody?

07:00.180 --> 07:02.779
So, you just left her, then.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.779
Look, I won't say I was wrong to
leave my kids but I had my reasons.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.499
But I'm back now and Norma
isn't part of that, end of story.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.059
How's she taking it?

07:16.060 --> 07:20.059
You have to learn to accept change,
don't you, whenever it comes.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.659
Right.

07:22.660 --> 07:25.099
It's your round, Monica, isn't it?

07:25.100 --> 07:29.099
What am I like?
Same again?

07:40.340 --> 07:43.259
It's bound to happen, innit?

07:43.260 --> 07:47.259
Norma's not exactly...is she?

07:50.900 --> 07:54.899
Can't...say I blame her.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.299
It's good,

07:58.300 --> 08:00.819
you know, for the kids though.

08:00.820 --> 08:04.819
Got their mother back.

08:07.140 --> 08:11.139
So when...did I tell you?

08:12.620 --> 08:13.899
You tell me, Frank.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.219
What?

08:15.220 --> 08:16.899
You must have told me some time,

08:16.900 --> 08:18.459
mustn't you,
cos why would you have not?

08:18.460 --> 08:20.699
Yeah, right.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.979
Well, yeah.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.659
I was just saying to Frank,
it'll be so lovely to have you back.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.459
Another pair of hands around.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.979
Oh, that's a lovely ring, Sheila.
Is it QVC?

08:29.980 --> 08:33.299
Yeah, well,
should probably go, Sheila.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.539
Got stuff to do, food shopping.

08:35.539 --> 08:38.139
No thanks. I'd rather stay here for
another drink. Wouldn't you, Monica?

08:38.140 --> 08:41.179
Oh, yes, I'm very happy.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.979
Right.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.259
Must say, you have cleaned up
his act

08:45.260 --> 08:48.899
if he's willing to leave the pub
before closing time.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.499
Different man, aren't you, Frank?

08:50.500 --> 08:54.339
Mm.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.699
Mmm.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.659
Oh, another one down.

08:58.660 --> 09:02.339
I do admire your restraint, Sheila.

09:02.340 --> 09:06.339
Right.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.019
You let him out, you bastards!

09:08.020 --> 09:09.099
You tell 'em, Ma.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.139
You let my Jamie out or
I'll have the lot of yous!

09:12.140 --> 09:15.019
They let him out two hours ago.

09:15.020 --> 09:15.699
For fuck's sake!

09:15.700 --> 09:18.219
This is your fault, Shane.

09:18.220 --> 09:22.219

eight minutes' patience

09:47.140 --> 09:50.179

14:19.980 --> 14:23.979
All right?

14:24.180 --> 14:26.419
This has got Vitamin C in it.

14:26.420 --> 14:30.419
It's very good for you.

14:30.460 --> 14:34.459
Bitch.

14:35.140 --> 14:39.139
You don't need to do it for him.

14:48.420 --> 14:52.419
Come on.
Be quiet. She might hear.

14:53.940 --> 14:57.939
Cat litter!
As in, litter for cats.

15:00.220 --> 15:04.059
Is everyone around here retarded?

15:04.060 --> 15:06.219
I need the fucking toilet!

15:06.220 --> 15:08.779
Norma, hello.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.059
You could use ours.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.779
Thank fuck. Somebody normal.

15:12.780 --> 15:14.619
You'll have to take your shoes off.

15:14.620 --> 15:17.739
Please don't touch the walls,
because I've cleaned.

15:17.740 --> 15:21.739
OK. Let's go.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.899
Ah, see - I didn't need you.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.459
What the fuck is that?!

15:32.460 --> 15:34.699
A Royal Heffernan.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.379
9/4 favourite, Saturday.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.939
Dead fucking cert.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.699
Owner's got a mint riding on it.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.299
They'll soon cough up theransom
to get him back.

15:42.300 --> 15:46.219
And because you didn't pitch in, now
you don't see any of the winnings.

15:46.220 --> 15:47.739
I've got my own plans.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.219
Course you have.
Chip off the old block, eh?

15:50.220 --> 15:52.979
I'm gonna run him in someother
races while I've got him.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.179
Make even more cash.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.939
No-one will even recognise him.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.379
Really?!

15:57.380 --> 15:58.619
Yep.

15:58.620 --> 16:02.619
Kidnapped the jockey
as well have you?

16:04.540 --> 16:06.859
Ah!

16:06.860 --> 16:10.099
It's like she's some fucking
changeling or something.

16:10.100 --> 16:14.099
One minute it's all, "I'll have
yourstir-fry on the table when
you get back from Stuttgart,"

16:14.540 --> 16:16.459
and the next - dust.

16:16.460 --> 16:20.459
She wouldn't even talk to us,
the mad bitch. Oh, but I love her.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.099
So...
What do you think happened, then?

16:25.140 --> 16:27.499
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.819
Richard and bastard Judy.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.939
I told her not to watch that crap!

16:31.940 --> 16:35.219
Some Christian wanker
banging on about family.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.019
We're the victims.Me and her.

16:38.020 --> 16:42.019
Fucking patriarchal, hegemony
pissing all over us.

16:42.620 --> 16:45.859
So you don't think she's
back for them, then?

16:45.860 --> 16:49.859
Shelia, she had somepast life
regression last solstice.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.459
Came back saying thekids weren't
even hers.

16:52.460 --> 16:55.099
Belong to somefucking witch
in the 14th century.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.699
But she stood on a lay line and

16:56.700 --> 16:59.939
sent the kids to the wrong womb.
Course she's not back for them.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.739
But she's still a lesbian though?

17:01.740 --> 17:04.019
But she's still a lesbian though?
Yeah, course she is, you daft bitch.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.779
(FARTS) We may not have had sex in
the past eight months

17:06.780 --> 17:09.459
but youdon't go
back and forward, do ya?

17:09.460 --> 17:10.979
No sex?

17:10.980 --> 17:13.898
Hang on a minute. Ican't do
two things at once in here.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.618
SQUELCHING

17:17.619 --> 17:20.858
Hey, Sheila?
You got any more bog roll?

17:20.859 --> 17:24.858
Sheila?!

17:28.180 --> 17:32.179
Aargh!Pervert!

17:33.900 --> 17:37.059
Who is it, then? Peters and Lee?

17:37.060 --> 17:40.139
It is Kevin and Veronica.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.699
I was going to say, I didn't know
they put Peters and Lee in prison.

17:43.700 --> 17:47.699
Mind you... Welcome Home
weren't much of a song, was it?

17:47.780 --> 17:49.539
Rainy days and Mondays was better.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.179
That weren't Peters and Lee.

17:51.180 --> 17:55.179
Do you mind?
My daughter has been incarcerated.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.899
Do you mind?
My daughter has been incarcerated.
She's not exactly Nelson fucking
Mandela, Carol. Thank you.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.499
She was trying to steal a baby.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.179
She was paying for it.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.019
What, with the money she'd stolen
from everyone around here?

18:05.020 --> 18:07.219
I can't see you getting many
fucking takers.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.859
I'm only doing what
any mother would do.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.379
I've got to do something.

18:13.380 --> 18:17.059
Even if it's just widow's mites.

18:17.060 --> 18:21.059
I'll have a T-shirt, Carol.

18:23.340 --> 18:27.339
Out of my pension.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.699
I just thought,
now that we're friends

18:30.700 --> 18:33.139
we could go shopping together.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.619
Sorry, Sheil. I'm too busy here.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.779
I could babysit the twins
for you at yours if you like.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.539
No, I need to get some new stuff.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.139
I thought...

18:43.140 --> 18:44.779
Since we like the same drink,

18:44.780 --> 18:46.899
maybe we have the same taste
in clothes.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.259
I mean,

18:49.260 --> 18:51.579
you could give me a second opinion.

18:51.580 --> 18:54.579
We could have a nice girly day out.

18:54.580 --> 18:58.579
I could do the washing up, Mum.

19:05.940 --> 19:09.939
See this?
Ned Kelly, proper Irish hero.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.219
Morning, can I help youse officers?

19:13.220 --> 19:14.539
We were just...

19:14.540 --> 19:16.419
We were just...
A racehorse has been stolen.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.819
We want to know ifyou've seen
anything.

19:17.820 --> 19:21.659
We want to know ifyou've seen
anything.
No. Haven't seen anything.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.899
Jamie... Have you met Jamie,
my eldest?

19:23.900 --> 19:25.659
Have you seen anything?

19:25.660 --> 19:27.859
Not so as I recall.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.579
Shane, have you seen a racehorse
around these parts?

19:29.580 --> 19:32.099
I ain't seen shit.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.619
Sorry, can't help you.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.419
If we do, we'll let you know.

19:38.420 --> 19:42.419
Right. Obliged. Nice to meet you.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.179
What are you doing?

19:49.180 --> 19:53.179
Different horse.
Hasn't got white socks.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.739
Yeah, I just need to know...

20:01.740 --> 20:03.419
There's a queuing system.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.419
So get yourself a ticket,
take a seat, yeah?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.899
You're Jamie Maguire, aren't you?

20:16.900 --> 20:18.979
Who did you kill?

20:18.980 --> 20:20.059
Fuck off, will you?

20:20.060 --> 20:21.779
I've killed a man.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.859
No, you haven't.

20:23.860 --> 20:27.859
I have. I shot him.
And his head fell off.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.259
Good for you.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.979
Come to have a pop at me, have you?

20:32.980 --> 20:36.899
Come to proveyourself
to the hard man.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.779
Come on then, if you want some.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.779
Do you want some?

20:55.300 --> 20:56.739
You all right?

20:56.740 --> 20:58.419
Yes, what can I get you?

20:58.420 --> 21:02.419
Pint of lager and
any chance of a job going?

21:03.300 --> 21:04.579
Er...Job?

21:04.580 --> 21:06.299
Job?That's right.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.419
Here?

21:07.420 --> 21:08.659
This is your pub, isn't it?

21:08.660 --> 21:12.459
Right and how much
will you want paying for that?

21:12.460 --> 21:15.059
Whatever the going rate is.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.499
I dunno.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.499
Make me an offer, then.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.459
What do you pay for
a protection racket?

21:25.460 --> 21:28.379
How the fuck should I know?

21:28.380 --> 21:30.579
How about 80?

21:30.580 --> 21:33.699
A week?

21:33.700 --> 21:34.779
A day.

21:34.780 --> 21:38.219
80 a day? All right.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.499
Is there a room with the job?

21:39.500 --> 21:43.499
Is there a room with the job?
Room?! Yeah.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.899
What you doing? That's my room.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.059
Yeah, but you're fired.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.619
Yeah, but you're fired.
What?

21:52.620 --> 21:55.219
All right,
I shagged the delivery guy.

21:55.220 --> 21:59.219
It's not that - it's him.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.499
Next!

22:01.500 --> 22:05.499
BEEPING

22:06.940 --> 22:08.899
Oh, Christ.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.139
Right, so...

22:11.140 --> 22:14.379
All I need, see, is a divorce.

22:14.380 --> 22:17.499
I was hoping you could

22:17.500 --> 22:21.499
tell me which way you do it,
ifyou don't want her to know.

22:22.260 --> 22:24.139
"Her" being?

22:24.140 --> 22:25.619
The wife.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.139
My ex-wife.

22:27.140 --> 22:30.779
Soon to be.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.019
Next!

22:32.020 --> 22:34.019
BEEPING

22:34.020 --> 22:37.059
It's difficult, isn't it,
as you get older?

22:37.060 --> 22:40.779
You don't know what to wear.
You want to look sexy,

22:40.780 --> 22:44.779
but not looking like you charge
a fiver for a hand job.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.859
Or is it the same for, you know,
lesbians?

22:49.860 --> 22:53.859
I mean, what age do you stop wearing
cargo pants, or don't you?

22:55.260 --> 22:59.259
I don't know. I never have.
I prefer something more feminine.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.939
Oh, like these.

23:01.940 --> 23:05.939
Look. You can never have
enough lingerie, can you?

23:06.340 --> 23:09.819
It's like what they say - you can
never be too rich or too thin.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.139
Except for that Posh Spice,
she is, isn't she?

23:12.140 --> 23:14.499
And she's dipped in wood stain.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.019
Looks lovely on you.

23:16.020 --> 23:20.019
Let's try some on!

23:20.660 --> 23:24.659
So, Monica,
what kind of women do you like?

23:25.380 --> 23:28.059
Oh, no.

23:28.060 --> 23:29.659
Let's sit out here, shall we?

23:29.660 --> 23:31.379
The small ones are a bit
claustrophobic.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.179
The small ones are a bit
claustrophobic.
I thought you were agoraphobic.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.979
Agoraphobic/claustrophobic.

23:35.980 --> 23:37.619
Anything you like, really.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.619
Illness poker, me.
Raise me one, if you like.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.339
What are you doing, Sheila?

23:49.340 --> 23:53.339
Do you want me to help you, Monica?
I know you want me to help you.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.739
I've got very big breasts.

23:55.740 --> 23:57.779
It's every woman's fantasy.

23:57.780 --> 24:01.779
Lesbianism. I know it's mine.
We're all bisexual, aren't we?

24:02.060 --> 24:03.859
Are you bisexual, Monica?

24:03.860 --> 24:07.859
Or are you just gay? Aargh!

24:09.300 --> 24:11.939
It'snotmysexuality
that's in question.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.499
Did Frank put you up to this?

24:13.500 --> 24:17.499
I just want to know if you want to
- if that's why you've come back?

24:17.980 --> 24:19.179
Get off!

24:19.180 --> 24:23.179
Monica! Aargh!

24:24.740 --> 24:28.739
Good God! They're on drugs.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.379
Get off!

24:32.380 --> 24:33.379
Get off!
That's enough!

24:41.860 --> 24:45.859
If you want the horse back alive
get 20,000 ready in used notes.

24:46.260 --> 24:47.259
'Who is this?'

24:47.260 --> 24:49.659
Fuckin' knifeman, that's who!

24:49.660 --> 24:51.419
Can you hear that?!

24:51.420 --> 24:52.499
'OK, OK, calm down.'

24:52.500 --> 24:56.499
And if you call the pigs again
you'll have his head on your
pillow first thing in the fuckin'...

24:58.140 --> 24:59.939
For fuck's sake, Jamie!

24:59.940 --> 25:00.379
'Jamie who?'

25:00.380 --> 25:02.419
You stupid fuckin' prick, Shane!

25:02.420 --> 25:03.299
What did you say his name for?

25:03.300 --> 25:07.179
Don't upset your brother, Shane -
you know how gets when he's angry.

25:07.180 --> 25:10.099
Why not fucking make him do summat
instead of hanging around pub?

25:10.100 --> 25:14.099
Don't bother. I'm moving out!

25:16.140 --> 25:18.899
So that's what you were after
all along, was it?

25:18.900 --> 25:21.059
When you asked me out?

25:21.060 --> 25:22.659
Make a pass at me.

25:22.660 --> 25:25.819
I just...

25:25.820 --> 25:29.139
I just wanted to know
if you were still a lesbian.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.019
I'm sorry.

25:31.020 --> 25:34.499
It's just I know what a hold
you used have over Frank

25:34.500 --> 25:36.299
and I got scared.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.299
I can see why he's with you.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.259
Lovely figure.

25:43.260 --> 25:45.179
Good cook. >

25:45.180 --> 25:46.739
City and Guilds.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.499
Grade 1.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.499
Don't think I'd even know
how to be with a man any more,

25:51.500 --> 25:53.419
wouldn't know what to do.

25:53.420 --> 25:57.019
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget.

25:57.020 --> 26:01.019
I don't think I was very good in the
first place. Frank and me, well,...

26:02.060 --> 26:05.339
It's easy, just give 'em a blow-job.
They do anything for one of those.

26:05.340 --> 26:06.899
Really?

26:06.900 --> 26:10.139
The trick is to hum while
you're doing it.

26:10.140 --> 26:12.699
Makes it vibrate more.

26:12.700 --> 26:16.699
Tell you the truth, I found that out
by accident when I was humming
the theme tune to Ready Steady Cook.

26:18.300 --> 26:21.539
Frank went off like a rocket.

26:21.540 --> 26:25.539
1812 Overture's the best though,
Tchaikovsky. It's all those cannons.

26:26.260 --> 26:30.259
Frank'd do anything
for those cannons.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.539
So, you never said, are you...

26:38.540 --> 26:42.539
Are you still a lesbian then?

26:44.820 --> 26:48.819
I've only ever wanted one woman.

26:48.820 --> 26:52.019
That's Norma.

26:52.020 --> 26:56.019
Oh.

27:01.300 --> 27:05.139
What's the point of you crackpot
fuckin' Mormon God-freaks then?

27:05.140 --> 27:08.299
Polygamy was the one
fucking good idea you had.

27:08.300 --> 27:12.299
Bunch of Ken dolls. >

27:13.060 --> 27:17.059
Hey, and I'm gonna burn
me Donny Osmond albums an' all!

27:20.900 --> 27:24.899
Right, so... huh?

27:25.500 --> 27:29.499
What the hell are they doing
in here?

27:31.940 --> 27:35.539
Oh, me feet!

27:35.540 --> 27:39.019
I've been around the estate twice
for old coppers.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.259
And me.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.139
You think you've got problems.

27:42.140 --> 27:45.299
Do us a favour, Lil,
and get me a drink in.

27:45.300 --> 27:49.299
Oh, what's she like?

27:53.100 --> 27:55.539
I don't understand.
What the fuck's he playing at?

27:55.540 --> 27:57.459
He's got his reasons.

27:57.460 --> 28:01.459
He'll tell us when he's ready.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.739
All right, you lot,
that's your time, please!

28:05.740 --> 28:06.299
What's going on here now?

28:06.300 --> 28:07.979
You're jokin', aren't you?

28:07.980 --> 28:11.419
Where the fuck you been?
Not till 12.

28:11.420 --> 28:15.099
I mean it's just that we can open
later now than before.

28:15.100 --> 28:18.379
It's all right, everybody.
It's just a mistake.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.739
We're open till 12!

28:20.740 --> 28:24.739
Oi, sit back down!

28:37.140 --> 28:39.339
So have you got everything
you need, have you?

28:39.340 --> 28:41.659
Yeah. Good night.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.259
Good night.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.739
Why don't you get him dancing girls
an' all?

28:45.740 --> 28:47.979
Karen, he's mutilated people.
What do you want me to do?

28:47.980 --> 28:49.499
Grow a spine?

28:49.500 --> 28:52.419
Hey, I'm not having that.
All right, it's your choice -

28:52.420 --> 28:56.419
you can share with me,
or you can share with him.

29:13.340 --> 29:17.339
LATCH TURNS

29:24.140 --> 29:28.139
Jamie?

29:29.780 --> 29:33.779
What... what d'you want?

29:56.780 --> 30:00.099
(MOANS)

30:00.100 --> 30:04.099
(MOANS)

30:42.660 --> 30:46.659
Oh, where the fuck?

30:49.660 --> 30:52.779
She actually said
she wanted to get back with Norma?

30:52.780 --> 30:55.459
She might as well have done.

30:55.460 --> 30:59.339
It's, it's just gone stale.
You can tell.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.779
Norma not making an effort,

31:01.780 --> 31:03.699
Monica frustrated,

31:03.700 --> 31:05.619
taking out her anger.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.259
You know what it's like -

31:07.260 --> 31:11.259
been together for a while,
first casualty's cunnilingus.

31:11.500 --> 31:15.499
Well, you will. (MOANS)

31:17.380 --> 31:21.379
She wants to go home with Norma,
I know she does.

31:23.820 --> 31:27.819
Bring the Fuzz-away.
We might need it. (MOANS)

31:38.260 --> 31:39.739
'Ere, horsey, horsey!

31:39.740 --> 31:41.619
Have you seen an 'orse?

31:41.620 --> 31:42.499
An 'orse?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.019
Yes, a fucking horse.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.339
About that big. You can't miss it.

31:46.340 --> 31:50.339
Forget it.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.219
Royal Heffernan!

31:52.220 --> 31:53.179
Roy-ie!

31:53.180 --> 31:54.579
Jim-bo!

31:54.580 --> 31:55.579
Fuck off!

31:55.580 --> 31:59.579
Leg it!

31:59.740 --> 32:03.659
I'm not conforming
to this shite, Sheila.

32:03.660 --> 32:07.659
It's just society scared
of real women and our hairy bits.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.659
Wanting us to look like kids.

32:09.660 --> 32:13.659
But sometimes, Norma,
it's just making the gesture,
that's all it takes.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.459
It's like chilli con carne -

32:16.460 --> 32:19.699
if you lose the garnish,
all of civilisation crumbles.

32:19.700 --> 32:23.699
She has to remember you're attractive
to other women, that's all.

32:23.740 --> 32:26.739
I mean, look.It says here,
"Lack creates desire and..."

32:26.740 --> 32:30.739
Hey, if that's that Freud pillock,
I'm not havin' it.

32:31.220 --> 32:34.779
Fuckin' going on about chicks
wanting dicks. 'Fuck's he on?

32:34.780 --> 32:36.259
It's Jade Goody in Hello.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.259
We all need a boost now and again.
Freshen ourselves up.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.339
Are you saying I smell?

32:42.340 --> 32:45.499
No. No, of course not, Norma.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.259
Well, you do a bit.

32:47.260 --> 32:50.059
Anyway. You just have a soak
in there for a minute,

32:50.060 --> 32:52.779
I'll get you a glass of dry Italian.
There you go.

32:52.780 --> 32:54.179
Cheers.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.539
Come on.

32:56.540 --> 33:00.539
(HUMS TO HERSELF)

33:09.860 --> 33:11.859
Bloody Nora.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.499
Don't look at me.
I didn't put owt in it.

33:14.500 --> 33:17.339
How the fuck do you lose
a bleedin' horse?

33:17.340 --> 33:20.779
I don't know. I think someone's
nicked it. It weren't my fault.

33:20.780 --> 33:24.779
Jesus Christ alive!

33:26.980 --> 33:28.939
There you go.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.459
What the fuck do you want?

33:30.460 --> 33:33.099
A round on the house can't hurt,
can it?

33:33.100 --> 33:35.619
Cut the fucking shite.
What do you want?

33:35.620 --> 33:37.899
Well, look, the thing is, Mimi,

33:37.900 --> 33:41.499
Your Jamie and this job he's doing.
I don't know what it is,

33:41.500 --> 33:44.259
but if the brewery get wind of it,
I'm sunk.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.939
I'll give you free drinks for life,
just, please, speak to him.

33:47.940 --> 33:51.939
My Jamie does what he likes,
where he likes.

33:52.380 --> 33:55.019
Hey, Jamie, you just carry on, lad,

33:55.020 --> 33:57.579
with whatever job it is
you're doing from here.

33:57.580 --> 34:00.659
We're right behind ya.

34:00.660 --> 34:04.619
I'm not running a job.
Not from here, not from anywhere.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.539
I'm going straight.

34:06.540 --> 34:10.018
That's why I took the 'orse back
to its owner.

34:10.020 --> 34:14.018
You fucking what?

34:16.620 --> 34:20.619
Now has anybody else got a problem
with that?

34:22.219 --> 34:25.458
Cock.

34:25.460 --> 34:28.619
You see, Black Forest gateau's got
a terrible reputation,

34:28.620 --> 34:32.619
but it's actually a very sensual
cake, rustic, invented in the 1930s.

34:34.219 --> 34:36.498
Sounds lovely, Sheila.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.059
Monica loves chocolate. She told me.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.938
It's one of the things
Norma won't let her have.

34:41.940 --> 34:45.539
Which is very short-sighted of her
cos it's actually aphrodisiac.

34:45.540 --> 34:48.978
You wait - there'll be no
holding her back, the dirty bitch.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.938
Oh and it's a very evocative name
for lesbians.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.899
Unless she waxes.

34:53.900 --> 34:57.899
Come on. Let's get this over there.
(MOANS)

35:04.780 --> 35:08.779
Oh.

35:09.100 --> 35:13.099
Norma?

35:18.500 --> 35:22.339
You all right, Bird?

35:22.340 --> 35:25.819
Dinner is served.

35:25.820 --> 35:29.819
Come on.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.139
You look nice, Norma.

35:46.690 --> 35:49.969
You've even got lipstick on.

35:49.970 --> 35:51.809
It's...

35:51.810 --> 35:54.169
It's fanny pink.

35:54.170 --> 35:57.929
Debbie gave it me.

35:57.930 --> 36:01.929
It's fancy pink.
I told you you need glasses.

36:04.010 --> 36:07.289
You told me you loved me.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.689
So...

36:09.690 --> 36:11.609
what happened, bird?

36:11.610 --> 36:15.569
Can't we sort this out?

36:15.570 --> 36:16.729
Keep the change.

36:16.730 --> 36:18.489
Cheers, mate.

36:18.490 --> 36:19.769
So he's really going straight then?

36:19.770 --> 36:20.929
Apparently.

36:20.930 --> 36:24.209
Great. Then I can
have me job back. Oi!

36:24.210 --> 36:27.249
You only got me job because
people are too scared of you.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.769
Karen!

36:28.770 --> 36:30.049
So this was...

36:30.050 --> 36:32.729
My job and now I want it back!

36:32.730 --> 36:35.569
Hang on a minute! I have
some say in this, it is my pub

36:35.570 --> 36:37.609
and there's been no trouble
in here since he started!

36:37.610 --> 36:38.649
Jez!

36:38.650 --> 36:42.329
So why don't you share it?
Half the week each.
That's me final offer.

36:46.890 --> 36:48.609
You're still a fucking perv!

36:48.610 --> 36:50.209
You what?

36:50.210 --> 36:54.209
You came into Jez's room
last night and you started
getting off with me dress.

36:54.610 --> 36:56.289
Was I sleep walking?

36:56.290 --> 36:57.849
Look, I sleep walk.

36:57.850 --> 37:01.849
Dunno what you were doing,
but you were bollock naked
and you were groping my dress.

37:02.410 --> 37:03.529
So you saw me?

37:03.530 --> 37:05.129
Course I did.

37:05.130 --> 37:07.369
Well, how much did you see?

37:07.370 --> 37:08.689
Everything.

37:08.690 --> 37:12.689
In detail, close up.

37:13.210 --> 37:17.209
Who's pervin' now, eh?

37:17.890 --> 37:20.769
Oh, there's no
community spirit any more.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.849
It's every man for himself,
isn't it?

37:22.850 --> 37:24.569
I should have known
nobody would give anything.

37:24.570 --> 37:28.569
Can I have my pension back then?

37:28.890 --> 37:32.769
I've given
it to a kiddies charity!

37:32.770 --> 37:36.769
Oh! What are you like?

37:47.290 --> 37:47.929
What's happening?

37:47.930 --> 37:48.769
They're holding hands.

37:48.770 --> 37:49.929
Are you sure?

37:49.930 --> 37:53.449
Yeah.

37:53.450 --> 37:57.449
There's a cherry on the top.

37:58.250 --> 38:02.249
Norm, the one thing that
you can't give me is what I need.

38:06.730 --> 38:10.329
Me babies.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.649
So, it's really them then?

38:12.650 --> 38:14.609
I've told ya!

38:14.610 --> 38:16.569
Well, all right.

38:16.570 --> 38:20.569
If that's what it's about,
I'll have a baby for you!

38:23.010 --> 38:25.329
I mean, I'm not
fucking any bloke, mind.

38:25.330 --> 38:29.249
We'll have to, er, get a donation,
but if that's what it takes,

38:29.250 --> 38:31.449
I'm there.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.129
You'd do that for me?

38:34.130 --> 38:38.129
I'd do anything for you.

38:38.210 --> 38:42.089
Please, please,
please come back to me.

38:42.090 --> 38:44.969
Oh, Norm.

38:44.970 --> 38:48.969
D'you really love me that much?

38:57.330 --> 39:01.329
Well?

39:06.130 --> 39:10.129
I need the loo.

39:14.610 --> 39:17.049
So, what's she said?

39:17.050 --> 39:19.369
She's thinking about it. >

39:19.370 --> 39:22.569
I've offered her a baby.

39:22.570 --> 39:23.809
A baby?

39:23.810 --> 39:27.409
That's what I've promised...
if she'll come back.

39:27.410 --> 39:31.009
Might have to get someone
else to do it, though.

39:31.010 --> 39:33.409
How do two women...?

39:33.410 --> 39:35.769
Turkey baster!

39:35.770 --> 39:38.009
TV PLAYS

39:38.010 --> 39:42.009
Oh, Frank.

39:42.890 --> 39:46.329
I'm so confused.

39:46.330 --> 39:48.929
Norma's offered me a baby.

39:51.850 --> 39:55.609
Well...

39:55.610 --> 39:59.609
I mean, supposing
it's all just words

39:59.810 --> 40:03.809
and it all just
gets tired again and...

40:03.890 --> 40:07.889
I end up feeling trapped.

40:08.130 --> 40:09.929
Oh, Frank.

40:09.930 --> 40:12.849
I need a hug.

40:12.850 --> 40:14.049
Oh.

40:14.050 --> 40:15.449
Oh.

40:15.450 --> 40:17.409
Oh.

40:17.410 --> 40:19.809
Oh.

40:19.810 --> 40:21.889
Oh.

40:21.890 --> 40:24.649
Oh.

40:24.650 --> 40:28.649
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do

40:30.490 --> 40:34.489
# Do-do-do-do-do

40:35.370 --> 40:37.609
# Do-do... #

40:37.610 --> 40:40.049
So, you get a
turkey baster and you...

40:40.050 --> 40:41.169
Is that singing?

40:46.490 --> 40:50.489
I can't hear anything.

40:51.330 --> 40:52.809
Oh!

40:52.810 --> 40:56.329
Oh! Oh! Oh!

40:56.330 --> 41:00.329
HE GROANS

41:31.690 --> 41:35.689
Where's the fucking remote?

41:35.770 --> 41:38.369
Oh, no. It's all right,
you don't have to go.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.089
I'm sorry, Norma. I can't do it.

41:41.090 --> 41:43.809
It's my babies here I need.

41:43.810 --> 41:46.049
What are you talking about?

41:46.050 --> 41:48.529
I'm not coming back, Norm.

41:48.530 --> 41:52.529
And I am sorry to you three an' all,
you went to so much trouble.

41:53.370 --> 41:56.489
Food was lovely, though.

41:56.490 --> 41:58.409
It's all right.

41:58.410 --> 42:02.409
I understand.

42:20.690 --> 42:22.289
Here.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.769
Cheers.

42:24.770 --> 42:28.769
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?

42:29.090 --> 42:32.089
Nah. She'll come round.

42:32.090 --> 42:34.409
She's just not thinking straight. >

42:34.410 --> 42:38.169
She doesn't realise that
she can have me as well as you lot,

42:38.170 --> 42:42.169
but she will and when she does
I'll be here, waiting.

42:43.130 --> 42:47.129
You can use the inside toilets
from now on if you want to.

42:50.450 --> 42:52.529
Thanks.

42:52.530 --> 42:57.089
Electricity, 40 a quarter,
and I'll get you your rent book.

42:57.090 --> 43:00.009
Hey?

43:00.010 --> 43:04.009
We have to find a way of getting
shot of her. We just have to...

43:04.610 --> 43:06.249
Sheila, will you...

43:06.250 --> 43:08.289
I'm not fighting her
any more, Frank.

43:08.290 --> 43:10.929
If she wants the babies
she's entitled to that.

43:10.930 --> 43:13.129
Yeah, but, Sheila...

43:13.130 --> 43:16.409
It's too exhausting, hate.

43:16.410 --> 43:18.849
Anyway, the best woman's won.

43:18.850 --> 43:22.449
I'm married to you now, there's
nothing she can do about that.

43:22.450 --> 43:26.449
And if you love someone set them
free. I'm sitting you free, Frank.

43:26.570 --> 43:30.569
I'm trusting you.

43:34.130 --> 43:35.849
Hey, hey.

43:35.850 --> 43:37.689
Hey! What you doing?

43:37.690 --> 43:40.049
There was too much
sunlight yesterday.

43:40.050 --> 43:42.689
I'm feeling a bit insidey outsidey.

43:42.690 --> 43:46.689
Thought I'd make these for myself.

43:50.650 --> 43:53.969
'Squidgy-gate. Camilla-gate.

43:53.970 --> 43:56.609
'Watergate. Gareth Gates.

43:56.610 --> 44:00.609
'I mean, what's it all about, eh?
All these private secrets?

44:01.810 --> 44:04.449
'What good does it do, eh,
to let them out?

44:04.450 --> 44:07.689
'All you get's a
load of heartache and misery.

44:07.690 --> 44:11.689
'And what you don't know
can't hurt you, that's what I say.

44:11.930 --> 44:14.449
'Ignorance is bliss.

44:14.450 --> 44:17.249
'Plus, it must be true,
I mean, look at George Bush.

44:17.250 --> 44:27.249
'Thick as fucking shit,
yet he smiles enough, doesn't he?'
