00:02.698 --> 00:03.960
Previously onMom...Who are you?

00:04.046 --> 00:05.657
Who are you?
Landlord.

00:05.744 --> 00:08.443
Can I ask what
this is about?
Who are you?

00:08.530 --> 00:12.186
Really? We'’re starting over?

00:12.273 --> 00:14.188
Okay, I'’m her mother.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.885
You'’re living here?Absolutely not.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.800
Good, '’cause your living here--
rent will be higher.

00:17.887 --> 00:21.325
No, no, we wouldn'’t
want it to be higher.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.936
Your daughter--
three months behind on rent.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.722
Really?48 hours she don'’t pay,

00:26.809 --> 00:28.941
I send sheriff for eviction.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.031
Remember how I used to bet

00:31.118 --> 00:34.773
on football
and basketball and such?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.819
Yeah. You sucked at it.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.387
Still do.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.346
You gambled away
the rent money?!

00:42.433 --> 00:44.653
We never had rent money.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.786
I gambled away
what little we had

00:47.873 --> 00:50.963
on the hopes
of gettingthe rent money.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.487
Pack your stuff, Roscoe.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.010
We'’re going on
a surprise vacation.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.359
BONNIE:
Pack up, Violet.

00:55.446 --> 00:58.884
We'’re skipping out
on the rent.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.973
VIOLET:
This place sucks, Mom.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.019
Look on the bright side.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.587
We finally have HBO.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.507
Mom?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.291
What?

01:14.378 --> 01:16.293
I'’m going for a swim.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.078
Okay.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.564
Wait. What?

01:26.651 --> 01:28.218
ROSCOE:
Cannonball!

01:28.305 --> 01:30.002
[water splashing]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.179
Roscoe?!

01:32.266 --> 01:33.745
Stay where
I can see you!

01:33.832 --> 01:35.617
What'’s going on?

01:35.704 --> 01:39.664
Oh! Your brother still thinks
we'’re on vacation.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.753
Nothing like a motel room
in the morning

01:41.840 --> 01:45.148
to make you want
to kill yourself.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.019
Oh, come on.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.239
It'’s not so bad.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.112
Beds are comfortable,
we'’ve got hot water.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.288
There'’s even a safe
in the closet.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.986
Great. A place to store
all our disappointments.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.163
How long are we gonna
be homeless?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.817
Hey, hey, hey,
we are not homeless.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.080
Mom, tell her.Tell her what?

02:04.167 --> 02:06.082
Tell her that
everything'’s gonna be fine.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.692
Why would I do that?

02:09.172 --> 02:11.522
Violet, this is just temporary.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.350
Trust me, I have a plan.

02:13.437 --> 02:17.485
Roscoe, put the dead bird down!

02:17.572 --> 02:20.096
I still have a good job,

02:20.183 --> 02:23.926
your grandma'’s life-coaching
business is starting to pick up.

02:24.013 --> 02:24.927
Well...
What?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.930
Nothing.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.018
You'’ll see.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.889
Everything'’ll be fine.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.761
That'’s what you said
when you drew a mustache on me,

02:32.848 --> 02:34.545
and we drove out of Phoenix
in the middle of the night.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.593
Now... hang on.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.378
That was not a rent issue.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.553
What was it?

02:45.730 --> 02:48.211
It was a drug deal gone bad.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.694
You never hear
about the ones that go good.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.131
The point is,

02:55.218 --> 02:57.481
there'’s no use
in dwelling in the past.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.005
Now, if you'’ll excuse me,

03:00.092 --> 03:02.182
I have to go prepare myself

03:02.269 --> 03:04.184
to take on the day.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.534
To build a better tomorrow

03:06.621 --> 03:09.189
for myself and my family.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.067
[crying]:
Oh, God, we are so screwed.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.681
Sweetie, we can hear you.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.791
[in husky voice]: All right,
boys, here are your drinks.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.577
Thank you.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.450
Oopsie.
Somebody dropped a napkin.

03:55.626 --> 03:58.325
[sighs]

03:58.412 --> 04:00.152
Here you go.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.415
[laughs]

04:01.502 --> 04:04.200
That'’s better.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.812
[sighs]

04:07.899 --> 04:10.685
Okay, let me just tell you
about today'’s special.

04:10.772 --> 04:15.298
We have a succulent
chicken paillard

04:15.385 --> 04:17.517
that'’s been pounded very hard,

04:17.605 --> 04:20.825
just the way the
chicken likes it.

04:20.911 --> 04:24.568
I will let you fellas think
about that for a second.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.702
Ooh, somebody'’s
been working out.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.009
Walk with me.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.054
What'’s going on?

04:32.141 --> 04:33.969
This is a four-star restaurant,

04:34.056 --> 04:36.058
and you'’re doing everything but
give these people lap dances.

04:36.145 --> 04:39.148
Don'’t talk to table two.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.281
Christy, I know
you'’re trying to make money,

04:41.368 --> 04:42.978
but you can'’t let men
objectify you.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.936
Did you get a boob job?

04:45.023 --> 04:50.202
No, I just stuffed my bra
with my kid'’s tube socks.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.641
Really? It'’s very effective.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.296
Regardless, you need
to dial it back.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
I can'’t. I'’m in trouble.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.821
I need cash in a hurry.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.954
In fact, I was gonna wait
till after my shift was over

05:03.041 --> 05:05.392
to ask you, but since
we'’re talking about it now,

05:05.479 --> 05:07.872
I was hoping that
maybe you could lend me...

05:07.959 --> 05:09.657
Really?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.615
You just walk away?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.879
[sighs]

05:14.966 --> 05:16.881
Son of a bitch!

05:24.628 --> 05:26.978
I like this new thing you'’re
doing with your breasts.

05:28.153 --> 05:31.026
Here, knock yourself out.

05:32.723 --> 05:37.641
Mmm. Still warm.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.340
So what'’s going on?
Back on the pole?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.385
I wish.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.344
I'’d make more money
than I'’m making here.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.910
Aw, money problems. I'’m sorry.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.303
Thanks.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.261
You know, I could
possibly help.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.263
Really?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.048
That'’d be so great.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.137
I promise
I'’ll pay you right back.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.574
Oh, the arrangement I'’m thinking
of wouldn'’t require any payback.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.229
It'’s more of a services-
rendered-in-the-back-of-my-car

06:00.316 --> 06:01.883
sort of thing.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.364
That'’s it?
You just walk away?

06:07.671 --> 06:09.543
Give me my boobs back.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.243
Okay, let'’s see.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.071
I'’ve got Alaskan king crab,

06:16.158 --> 06:18.378
leg of lamb,

06:18.465 --> 06:19.857
chateaubriand.

06:19.944 --> 06:23.470
Can'’t we ever have burgers
and fries?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.733
When I start working
at McDonald'’s

06:25.820 --> 06:27.952
and stealing their food, yes.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.391
So you guys are,
like, homeless, huh?

06:31.478 --> 06:32.566
Hey, hey, hey!

06:32.653 --> 06:34.394
We'’re on vacation.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.093
Limited choices
in the vending machine.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.878
I got a Shasta, a Mr. Pibb

06:40.965 --> 06:43.054
and something called
"Hola Cola."

06:44.839 --> 06:46.841
Okay,

06:46.928 --> 06:49.060
before we start,

06:49.147 --> 06:52.063
I think we should say
a little prayer of thanks.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.717
For what?

06:53.804 --> 06:56.111
For this delicious food

06:56.198 --> 06:58.461
that rich people didn'’t finish.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.596
And more importantly,

07:02.683 --> 07:06.338
for sticking together
as a family.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.081
[in Cockney accent]:
God bless us, everyone.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.738
Pass the figgy pudding.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.566
[knocking]

07:16.653 --> 07:18.002
Who could that be?

07:18.089 --> 07:20.222
Well, we can
rule out housekeeping.

07:20.309 --> 07:23.268
It'’s just the girl
I'’m sponsoring.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.444
You invited her here?

07:24.531 --> 07:25.836
Why not?

07:25.923 --> 07:27.795
We have nothing
to be ashamed of.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.361
I disagree.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.363
Jill!

07:31.451 --> 07:32.887
Hi, come on in.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.237
Hey, what are you doing
in a motel?

07:35.324 --> 07:37.326
They'’re not homeless if
that'’s what you'’re thinking.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.154
Uh...

07:39.241 --> 07:40.851
we'’re here temporarily

07:40.938 --> 07:43.245
until our new place
is decorated.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.639
Can'’t live in a car
without curtains.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.816
It'’s so weird.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.166
My coke dealer used to live
right down the hall.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.950
I knew I'’d been here before!

07:55.518 --> 07:57.999
Okay, let me introduce you
to my family.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.218
You know Bonnie.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.394
This is my daughter Violet,

08:02.482 --> 08:03.831
her boyfriend Luke,

08:03.918 --> 08:05.093
my son Roscoe.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.355
You guys are really lucky

08:06.442 --> 08:07.835
to have a mom who'’s so together.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.967
Exactly how long
have you been sober?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.102
11 days.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.407
Can you believe it?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.061
Yes.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.807
Christy, can I have a word
with you in the east wing?

08:23.894 --> 08:26.288
Excuse me.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.463
We have a pool.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.856
I know.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.031
That'’s where they found
my dealer.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.734
She'’s a great gal, huh?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.909
Yeah. I don'’t know if this is
the Hola Cola talking,

08:39.996 --> 08:42.477
but are you out of your mind?

08:42.565 --> 08:43.697
What?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.089
With everything that'’s going on,

08:45.176 --> 08:47.048
youare helping her?

08:47.135 --> 08:48.266
Yes.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.573
It'’s called giving back.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.576
But you have nothing to spare.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.796
Mom, we'’re gonna be fine.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.537
You got to stay positive.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.496
Okay. I'’m positive
you have nothing to spare.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.152
[phone rings]

09:04.239 --> 09:05.806
Oh, it'’s Alvin.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.938
Does your father know
about our little situation here?

09:08.025 --> 09:10.071
No, I don'’t want him to worry.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.029
What'’s to worry about? I thought
you said everything'’s fine.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.117
It is fine.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.292
Then answer the phone.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.077
Okay, I will.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.035
[ringing continues]

09:22.474 --> 09:24.999
[ringing stops]

09:25.086 --> 09:26.566
I missed him.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.182
Hello?

09:34.269 --> 09:36.184
Anybody home?

09:38.055 --> 09:40.405
Christy?

09:41.668 --> 09:42.843
Oh.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.106
Hi.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.194
Who are you?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.239
Who are you?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.285
I asked you first.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.895
I'’m Roscoe'’s dad.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.594
I'’m Roscoe'’s grandfather.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.900
Oh, nice to meet you.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.686
Yeah.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.296
What-What are you doing here?

10:01.383 --> 10:03.211
Oh. I live in my van,

10:03.298 --> 10:06.867
so I take a shower whenever
the opportunity presents itself.

10:06.954 --> 10:10.348
A bucket and a rag
can only get you so far.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.524
All right.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.265
Uh, where is everybody?

10:14.352 --> 10:17.399
I don'’t know. I came by
last night, nobody here.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.749
Crashed on the couch.
Woke up this morning,

10:19.836 --> 10:21.446
still nobody here.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.622
The-The TV'’s gone.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.842
Oh. That rules out the Rapture.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.805
Who are you?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.284
Who are you?

10:33.371 --> 10:35.635
I'’m the owner
of this house.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.375
Just a heads up-- the water
pressure in the shower'’s

10:37.462 --> 10:40.552
a little low. You might
want to check on that.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.163
I'’ll check it...

10:42.250 --> 10:44.339
right after I shoot you.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.776
Now, who are you?

10:46.863 --> 10:48.343
I'’m Christy'’s ex-husband.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.518
And I'’m her father.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.389
Oh, really?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.609
Did you know your daughter
took her family and ran out

10:53.696 --> 10:55.916
in the middle of the night
to beat me out of the rent?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.657
My daughter wouldn'’t do that.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.528
[whispering]:
Yes, she would.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.357
[mouthing]

11:14.935 --> 11:16.676
[whispering]:
What are you doing?

11:16.763 --> 11:19.113
I'’m praying.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.688
How'’s it going?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.690
You tell me.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.692
Are we still here?

11:37.522 --> 11:40.090
Listen, I'’m sorry

11:40.177 --> 11:41.744
I'’ve been giving
you a hard time.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.486
I know you'’re doing
the best you can.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.662
Wow.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
One of my prayers
just got answered.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.015
What else you
asking for?

11:52.102 --> 11:54.626
Oh, you know...

11:54.714 --> 11:57.238
for God to give me
a little guidance,

11:57.325 --> 11:58.674
maybe a house.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.937
Why not a rich guy
who likes kids?

12:01.024 --> 12:04.201
I'’m trying to ask for things
that really exist.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.771
Come to bed.
Get some rest.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.730
Yeah.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.907
Wait.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.909
Amen.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.780
[sighs]

12:17.867 --> 12:19.260
It'’s important
to let him know you'’re done.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.268
[fast, heavy footsteps]

12:27.355 --> 12:30.445
What the hell?

12:30.532 --> 12:31.794
What'’s going on?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.625
Back in your room, ma'’am!

12:36.712 --> 12:37.887
Oh.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.323
OFFICER:
Police![crashing]

12:39.410 --> 12:41.021
[exclaims]
Everybody, get down!

12:43.327 --> 12:45.286
Oh!

12:45.373 --> 12:47.549
[knocking]

12:47.636 --> 12:49.420
Hi.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.857
What'’s going on?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.772
God wants us to
live with you.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.654
[grinding]

13:05.741 --> 13:07.134
Hey!Oh!

13:11.312 --> 13:13.705
[grinding stops]

13:13.793 --> 13:15.707
Sorry, I have to feed
the kitties.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.757
Smell that?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.585
That'’s the smell
of loneliness.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.808
Marjorie, I, uh,

13:28.895 --> 13:31.985
can'’t thank you enough
for taking us in.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.552
Oh, of course, sweetie,
it'’s nice to have the company.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.294
Love my cats, but they don'’t
ask me how my day was.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.079
Neither will I.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.822
I'’ll be at the pool.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.825
Oh, honey, Marjorie
doesn'’t have a pool.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.305
HBO?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.654
Sorry.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.657
[sighs]
Worst vacation ever.

13:55.486 --> 13:56.966
So, did you sleep okay?

13:57.053 --> 14:00.230
As good as I could
with my cat allergies.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.753
Aw, poor dear.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.018
Yeah, my nose is stuffy,

14:05.105 --> 14:06.584
my throat'’s scratchy,

14:06.671 --> 14:08.586
and my eyes are all puffy.

14:08.673 --> 14:09.849
Aw.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.763
I'’ll pick you up some Benadryl

14:11.851 --> 14:14.505
on my way home from the chemo.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.247
Thank you.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.641
Take your time.
Bye.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.251
[sighs]

14:21.338 --> 14:22.862
I love her,

14:22.949 --> 14:25.603
but she plays that cancer card
an awful lot.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.042
Ooh, smoothies.

14:29.129 --> 14:29.912
Violet, no!
Stop!

14:44.361 --> 14:45.928
Hope you enjoyed your meal.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.104
Just a reminder,
all of my tips

14:48.191 --> 14:50.367
are donated directly
to the homeless.

14:53.805 --> 14:54.763
Hi.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.243
Dad. Hi.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.853
What kind of a person
skips out on their rent?

14:57.940 --> 14:58.854
That'’s it?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.116
You just
walk away?

15:04.642 --> 15:08.081
Man, he really
tore me a new one.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.302
I was shaking
after he left the restaurant.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.303
You try blaming me?

15:13.390 --> 15:14.696
Of course.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.611
First words out of my mouth.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.007
He said I was a grown woman

15:21.094 --> 15:23.792
and I need to take
responsibility for my actions.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.446
What a douche.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.884
Hey.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.103
Do me a favor.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.669
Keep an eye on your brother.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.062
We'’re going to a meeting.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.846
Yeah, like that'’ll help.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.847
What?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.240
You'’ve been going

15:37.327 --> 15:38.676
to these stupid things
for a year,

15:38.763 --> 15:39.808
and where are we?

15:39.895 --> 15:42.550
You'’re kidding, right?

15:42.637 --> 15:43.943
I am sober.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.292
You'’re a loser.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.076
You take that back.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.077
Make me.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.252
Wait, wait.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.167
If you guys are gonna do this,

15:51.254 --> 15:53.082
let'’s get a mud pit
and make some money.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.738
This is all your fault.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.218
You ruined my life.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.654
Iruined it?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.786
I'’m the reason
you got pregnant?

16:01.873 --> 16:02.962
I'’m the reason you sit

16:03.049 --> 16:05.094
around all day
doing nothing?

16:05.181 --> 16:07.096
Instead of bitching and moaning,

16:07.183 --> 16:09.881
why don'’t you go to school,
get a job,

16:09.969 --> 16:10.926
make something of yourself!

16:11.013 --> 16:12.275
I hate you.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.239
[cat yowls]

16:23.286 --> 16:24.548
I'’m not wrong.

16:25.636 --> 16:26.811
She needs to grow up

16:26.898 --> 16:29.118
and start making
smart decisions.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.381
Yep.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.862
If only she had
some role models.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.824
And now I hate you.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.831
Hi, I'’m Christy.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.181
I'’m an alcoholic.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.486
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

16:49.573 --> 16:50.792
Not done.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.837
I'’m also a liar,

16:52.924 --> 16:54.709
a lousy mother

16:54.796 --> 16:56.406
and a deadbeat.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.234
She also farts
under the covers

16:58.321 --> 17:00.193
and blames
the cats.

17:03.413 --> 17:04.848
It'’s weird.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.635
When everything in my life
was falling apart,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.419
I was doing fine.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.638
I was handling.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.511
And then when things
started going good,

17:14.598 --> 17:17.036
I fell apart.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.689
Started gambling again.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.344
I got my family evicted.

17:21.431 --> 17:24.086
I put us all in danger.

17:24.173 --> 17:27.829
I'’m sure you read about the meth
lab at the motel that blew up.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.747
They were our neighbors.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.271
Well, they were
a couple doors down.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.968
Our actual neighbors

17:37.056 --> 17:39.406
were making some kind of porn.

17:44.019 --> 17:47.718
Anyway, I do have two things

17:47.805 --> 17:50.373
I can hold on to.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.506
Through it all,

17:52.593 --> 17:56.597
I'’ve stayed sober, and...

17:56.684 --> 18:00.035
I'’ve also helped
someone else stay sober.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.779
What up, bitches?!

18:04.866 --> 18:06.607
Ha!

18:06.694 --> 18:07.608
Hi!

18:12.743 --> 18:15.877
Okay, one thing.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.495
I mean, what the hell?

18:25.582 --> 18:28.237
He said he'’s gonna leave me
if I don'’t stop drinking,

18:28.324 --> 18:30.152
so I stop drinking,

18:30.239 --> 18:31.501
and what does he do?

18:31.588 --> 18:32.633
Files for divorce.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.243
So what do I do?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.202
What anybody would do.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.552
I set his bobble-head
collection on fire.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.644
You should'’ve seen it.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.602
200 flaming heads.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.083
Ha!

18:48.170 --> 18:49.954
Yeah.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.521
Okay, let'’s get some sleep.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.436
This'’ll all seem much worse
in the morning.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.264
Where are we
gonna sleep?

18:55.351 --> 18:56.439
Don'’t worry, once she'’s out,

18:56.526 --> 18:58.876
we'’ll roll her onto the floor.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.617
Oh, look,

19:00.704 --> 19:02.706
another success story.

19:02.793 --> 19:03.881
What are you doing?

19:03.968 --> 19:04.882
I'’m gonna go stay

19:04.969 --> 19:06.057
with my friend, Sarah.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.276
Okay.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.582
When are you coming back?

19:08.669 --> 19:09.713
I'’m not.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.412
What are you talking about?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.065
I don'’t want to be here anymore.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.806
I'’m done with all this.No.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.634
No, no, no, no, no. No.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.854
No one is done until
I say we'’re done.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.421
We'’re a family.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.118
We stick together,
no matter what.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.163
Why?

19:24.250 --> 19:25.773
Nothing about us works.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.821
Thank you for your
hospitality, Marjorie.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.432
You'’re welcome, dear.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.521
Damn it, Violet,
I forbid you to go.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.826
I am 18.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.220
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

19:44.052 --> 19:44.966
Bye, Grandma.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.621
Violet, don'’t.
