WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:08.539
READY TO GO, STAN?

00:08.539 --> 00:10.441
JUST A SECOND.

00:10.441 --> 00:12.543
GOTTA GO MAKE SURE
THAT SQUIRREL I BURIED
IS STILL BURIED.

00:12.543 --> 00:15.246
SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.618
THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT DEAD.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.790
THAT OCCURRED TO ME, TOO.

00:19.790 --> 00:22.153
( gasps )

00:22.153 --> 00:25.096
HOLD UP A MINUTE.
WES IS HERE.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.527
WHO?
WES.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.159
THE BOY FROM SCHOOL I LIKE.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.131
I FELT LIKE WE KIND OF
CONNECTED ON HALLOWEEN,

00:30.131 --> 00:31.632
WHEN I WAS DRENCHED
IN FAKE BLOOD,

00:31.632 --> 00:34.265
BUT WE'VE BARELY
SPOKEN SINCE THEN.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.107
DOES HE ONLY LIKE ME WHEN
I'M DRENCHED IN FAKE BLOOD?

00:36.107 --> 00:38.569
'CAUSE I'M WILLING
TO MAKE THAT A REGULAR THING.

00:38.569 --> 00:41.112
I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME--
WEDNESDAY,

00:41.112 --> 00:44.615
THE DAY YOU'RE
MORE INTERESTED IN BOYS
THAN YOUR TALKING DOG.

00:44.615 --> 00:47.148
IT'S THURSDAY.
I DID NOT SEE
THAT COMING.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.651
BUT IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA
STAY RELEVANT IN YOUR LIFE.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.324
I CAN HELP WITH BOYS.
WHAT KIND OF HELP DO YOU NEED?

00:53.324 --> 00:55.626
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO TALK TO HIM.

00:55.626 --> 00:57.628
GREAT. LET'S DO
A LITTLE ROLE-PLAYING.

00:57.628 --> 00:59.130
YOU BE YOU
AND I'LL BE THE BOY.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.132
( as teenage boy )
HEY, AVERY, S'UP?

01:01.132 --> 01:03.063
YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE LAKE WITH ME?

01:03.063 --> 01:06.837
WE'LL COUNT THE STARS
AND MAKE PROMISES.

01:06.837 --> 01:08.599
STAN, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

01:08.599 --> 01:10.301
( as teenage boy )
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

01:10.301 --> 01:13.104
YOU'RE SO STUCK UP.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

01:13.104 --> 01:16.107
( normal voice )
WELL, YOU BLEW IT
WITH THAT GUY.

01:16.107 --> 01:18.609
IF YOU WANT TO HELP,
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE

01:18.609 --> 01:20.381
AND SEE WHAT WES
IS SAYING TO HIS FRIENDS.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.513
OKAY.

01:22.513 --> 01:25.116
( as teenage boy )
I CAN'T BELIEVE I PUT ON
DEODORANT FOR NOTHING.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.517
YOU'RE SO WEIRD.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.362
SO, WHAT DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT WES?

01:31.362 --> 01:34.865
I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE
NO IDEA WHO WES IS.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.399
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HIS
FEET SMELL LIKE,

01:38.399 --> 01:39.830
AND USE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.533
ARE THEY AUSTERE
WITH A BALONEY FINISH,
FOR INSTANCE?

01:42.533 --> 01:44.705
THAT'S YOU.

01:48.779 --> 01:51.482
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL:
YOU ARE CORRECT.

01:51.482 --> 01:54.615
THAT IS WES.
I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

01:54.615 --> 01:58.289
I HAD MY DOUBTS.
I GET SUCH A STRONG
ELI VIBE FROM HIM.

01:58.289 --> 02:00.291
SO WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

02:00.291 --> 02:02.393
NOTHING. THE WHOLE TIME
HE WAS JUST BABBLING ON

02:02.393 --> 02:04.455
ABOUT HOW HE NEEDED
A TUTOR IN ONE OF
HIS CLASSES.

02:04.455 --> 02:07.458
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
AN ELI OR WHAT?

02:07.458 --> 02:13.133
STAN, THAT'S IT!
THAT'S MY IN!
HE NEEDS A TUTOR.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.835
( as teenage boy )
WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT HIM?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.567
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A CAR.

02:16.567 --> 02:19.570
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
IN THIS WHOLE STUPID
TOWN ANYWAY.

02:21.472 --> 02:24.715
AVERY JENNINGS TUTORING.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, I DO.

02:24.715 --> 02:30.150
AVERY JENNINGS TUTORING.
IF YOU DO KNOW IT,
I KNOW MORE.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.855
DO YOU NEED A TUTOR
OR WHAT?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.358
HEY, AVERY.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.430
I DIDN'T.
I'M ASKING EVERYBODY.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.732
I NEED CLIENTS FOR
MY NEW TUTORING BUSINESS.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.564
NOPE, GO AWAY.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.697
WELL, I COULD USE
SOME HELP IN SPANISH.

02:46.697 --> 02:48.669
THERE'S A TEST ON FRIDAY
AND I'M REALLY STRUGGLING.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.671
DO YOU SPEAK SPANISH?

02:50.671 --> 02:55.246
Stan: THAT IS THE FACE
OF SOMEONE WHO DOES
NOT SPEAK SPANISH.

02:55.246 --> 02:58.279
OF COURSE I SPEAK SPANISH.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.311
EVERYONE SHOULD
SPEAK SPANISH

03:00.311 --> 03:03.584
IN THIS INCREASINGLY
GLOBALIZED ECONOMY.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.657
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT MY CASA.

03:06.657 --> 03:08.859
PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

03:10.921 --> 03:13.524
AVERY IS PRETTY CRAZY
ABOUT THAT BOY,

03:13.524 --> 03:15.926
AND IT'S EVEN LED
TO HER FIRST PANIC LIE.

03:15.926 --> 03:19.730
AH, I REMEMBER MINE:

03:19.730 --> 03:21.902
All: OHHHHH!

03:21.902 --> 03:24.475
EW! TYLER!

03:42.453 --> 03:44.725
SO THERE WAS THIS
ONE TIME PEOPLE SAID

03:44.725 --> 03:46.497
I COULDN'T DO A TRIPLE
FLIP ON MY BIKE.

03:46.497 --> 03:49.860
I SHOWED THEM--
I LANDED ON THOSE PEOPLE.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.702
THAT'S WHERE
I GOT THIS SCAR.

03:51.702 --> 03:54.935
I GOT ONE OF THOSE
THE TIME I RAMPED OFF
THE RIDGE OF PAIN.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.838
BEFORE THAT,
IT WAS JUST "THE RIDGE OF."

03:57.838 --> 04:00.771
HEY, THAT'S WHERE
I MESSED UP MY KNEE.

04:00.771 --> 04:03.644
NOW WHEN I BEND IT,
IT POPS.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.446
( laughing ) SWEET.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.449
WHEN I DO THIS,
MY SHOULDER LOCKS.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.552
HEY-- I POP, YOU LOCK.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.923
LET'S POP AND LOCK.

04:17.688 --> 04:19.730
OOH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR NECK?

04:19.730 --> 04:22.763
DON'T KNOW.
DID THAT JUST NOW.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.735
I ONCE BANGED MY THROAT,
AND NOW WHEN I GURGLE WATER,

04:24.735 --> 04:27.868
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.302
( doorbell rings )

04:31.302 --> 04:33.003
HEY, NIKKI.
HEY.

04:33.003 --> 04:34.605
WHAT'S UP?

04:34.605 --> 04:36.477
I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU
FELT LIKE GOING TO THE MOVIE

04:36.477 --> 04:37.908
THAT'S PLAYING IN THE PARK
THIS WEEKEND.

04:37.908 --> 04:39.410
I CAN'T.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.911
I'M GOING WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND.

04:40.911 --> 04:42.553
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

04:42.553 --> 04:43.554
OH, YEAH,
SHE'S REALLY COOL.

04:43.554 --> 04:45.356
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO MEET HER.

04:45.356 --> 04:46.987
( gargling )

04:52.423 --> 04:53.724
WOW.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.726
TOLD YOU SHE WAS COOL.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.699
THERE SHE IS,

04:58.699 --> 05:01.001
OUR LITTLE GIRL
HOME FROM SCHOOL.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.603
WHAT DID YOU LEARN TODAY?

05:02.603 --> 05:05.376
I LEARNED THAT THE SUN
WILL SOMEDAY BURN OUT

05:05.376 --> 05:07.838
AND ALL LIFE ON EARTH
WILL CEASE TO EXIST,

05:07.838 --> 05:10.911
AND THAT SEVEN
TIMES SEVEN IS...

05:10.911 --> 05:12.583
OKAY, I DIDN'T LEARN THAT.

05:12.583 --> 05:16.447
WHY BOTHER, WITH THAT
WHOLE SUN THING HAPPENING?

05:16.447 --> 05:18.649
OH, AND I'M NOT CHLOE
ANYMORE.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.921
CHLOE-- AHEM--

05:20.921 --> 05:23.594
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
THIS BEFORE.

05:23.594 --> 05:26.357
YOU ARE NOT A PRINCESS
SEPARATED FROM HER PEOPLE

05:26.357 --> 05:28.599
AND FORCED TO LIVE
AMONG THE COMMON FOLK.

05:28.599 --> 05:30.901
YES, I KNOW,
I JUST FEEL THAT WAY.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.903
I'M TALKING ABOUT MY NAME.

05:32.903 --> 05:34.565
I DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED
CHLOE ANYMORE.

05:34.565 --> 05:36.607
ARE THE OTHER KIDS
MAKING FUN OF YOUR NAME?

05:36.607 --> 05:38.939
ARE THEY CALLING YOU
"GLOWY"?
NO.

05:38.939 --> 05:43.374
"SO-SO-IE"? "NO GROWY"?
"CAN'T THROWY"?
"WEIRD TOE-IE?"

05:43.374 --> 05:45.846
NO, THAT'S SO MEAN.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.619
AND WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY "TOE-IE"?

05:48.619 --> 05:51.522
SWEETHEART,
YOUR MOMMY ISN'T
BEING MEAN.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.384
SHE'S JUST WORRIED
THE OTHER KIDS WERE,

05:53.384 --> 05:55.786
AND WAS POINTING OUT
HOW THAT COULD WORK,

05:55.786 --> 05:57.858
IN A WAY THAT WAS
OVERLY SPECIFIC

05:57.858 --> 05:59.990
AND NOT WELL
THOUGHT-THROUGH.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.634
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST A LITTLE
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT,

06:03.634 --> 06:06.837
AFTER BEING CALLED "SMELLIN'"
IN KINDERGARTEN...

06:06.837 --> 06:10.140
THROUGH COLLEGE,
AND THEN AGAIN LAST YEAR.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.843
NO ONE'S BEING MEAN...

06:12.843 --> 06:14.845
AT SCHOOL.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.548
I JUST WANT A NEW NAME.

06:17.548 --> 06:20.581
AND A POOL
WITH A SLIDE!

06:20.581 --> 06:21.912
THINK ABOUT IT!

06:23.654 --> 06:25.516
WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

06:25.516 --> 06:28.018
I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS
THAT CHLOE'S DESIRE

06:28.018 --> 06:30.020
TO CHANGE HER NAME
STEMS FROM AN INNATE NEED

06:30.020 --> 06:32.663
TO ASSERT HER INDEPENDENCE
AND ESTABLISH HER IDENTITY.

06:32.663 --> 06:34.595
IT'S BEST IF WE JUST
LET IT PLAY OUT.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.828
YOU NEVER JUST SAY
"I DON'T KNOW."
WEIRD, HUH?

06:37.828 --> 06:40.571
JUST LIKE YOU NEVER SAY
"VERY TRENCHANT ANALYSIS,
BENNETT.

06:40.571 --> 06:43.173
YOUR INSIGHT MAKES ME
LOVE YOU ALL THE MORE."

06:43.173 --> 06:44.775
WEIRD, HUH?

06:47.978 --> 06:50.541
SO, SPEAK SPANISH YET?

06:50.541 --> 06:52.643
NO. I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THIS SPANISH SOAP OPERA,

06:52.643 --> 06:53.914
LACE AND TEARS.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.716
I HAVEN'T LEARNED
ANY SPANISH,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.718
ALTHOUGH I DID LEARN
THE EXPRESSION YOU MAKE

06:57.718 --> 06:59.149
WHEN YOUR THIRD HUSBAND
TELLS YOU HE'S REALLY

06:59.149 --> 07:02.022
YOUR FIRST HUSBAND
IN A DIFFERENT TURTLENECK.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.526
SO, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO TUTOR WES

07:05.526 --> 07:07.458
IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE LANGUAGE.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.829
THAT IS NIKKI.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.831
SHE'S COMING OVER
TO GIVE ME A CRASH COURSE.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.934
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
SPEAK SPANISH.
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.706
BILLIONS OF PEOPLE
SPEAK CHINESE.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.167
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE
THAT A SHOT?

07:19.109 --> 07:20.971
HEY, NIKKI, DID YOU
GET MY TEXT ABOUT
NEEDING

07:20.971 --> 07:22.643
TO LEARN
SPANISH BY TOMORROW?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.775
YES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TEXT BACK

07:24.775 --> 07:26.947
"YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND"
IN A SUPPORTIVE TONE,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.979
SO I CAME TO SAY IT
IN PERSON.

07:28.979 --> 07:32.122
"YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND."

07:32.122 --> 07:34.585
WELL, WE HAVE TO TRY.

07:34.585 --> 07:36.587
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

07:36.587 --> 07:40.691
I ALREADY KNOW SI, NO,
ADIOS, AND...

07:40.691 --> 07:41.932
( dramatic gasp )

07:41.932 --> 07:44.164
YOUR THIRD HUSBAND
IS REALLY YOUR FIRST HUSBAND

07:44.164 --> 07:46.597
IN A DIFFERENT TURTLENECK?

07:46.597 --> 07:49.099
OH, YOU WATCH
LACE AND TEARS!
WAIT.

07:49.099 --> 07:51.101
WHAT IF WE DID WHAT LUPE DID

07:51.101 --> 07:53.744
IN THE FAMOUS EPISODE
WHERE JUAN GETS IMPALED

07:53.744 --> 07:57.508
CALLED "A HOLE IN JUAN."

07:57.508 --> 08:00.250
JUAN GETS IMPALED?
WHILE HE'S IN THE COMA?

08:00.250 --> 08:02.482
OH, YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT UP.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.786
YES, HE COMA-WALKED
RIGHT INTO A BULLFIGHT.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.659
ANYWAY, IN THAT EPISODE,
LUPE TALKS TO HECTOR
THROUGH AN EARPIECE

08:08.659 --> 08:12.192
TO HELP HIM ROMANCE, WELL,
WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE HIS
SISTER'S FORMER CELLMATE,

08:12.192 --> 08:13.694
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THIS.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.195
RAMONA GOES TO PRISON?!

08:15.195 --> 08:18.969
RAMONA WAS FRAMED BY HER
OTHER PERSONALITY, RAMON.

08:20.731 --> 08:22.673
I AM A WALKING SPOILER ALERT.

08:22.673 --> 08:24.074
NO.

08:24.074 --> 08:26.607
YOU'RE A WALKING GENIUS.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.810
I'LL WEAR AN EARPIECE
AND YOU LISTEN IN AND GIVE ME

08:29.810 --> 08:32.212
THE SPANISH ANSWERS
SO THAT I CAN TUTOR WES.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.885
SO NIKKI'S GONNA HELP YOU
WITH THE TUTORING PART,

08:34.885 --> 08:36.887
BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST
AN EXCUSE TO GET HIM OVER HERE

08:36.887 --> 08:38.148
SO YOU CAN CONNECT WITH HIM.

08:38.148 --> 08:39.219
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT PART?

08:39.219 --> 08:41.722
AND DON'T SAY "FAKE BLOOD."

08:41.722 --> 08:45.225
HE'S RIGHT. I TOTALLY
FORGOT ABOUT THAT PART.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.257
I DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
OF SPANISH OR OF LOVE!

08:47.257 --> 08:49.930
NONE OF THE ROMANCE
LANGUAGES!

08:49.930 --> 08:52.162
OH, I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

08:52.162 --> 08:53.834
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING TO BOYS.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.206
THEY'RE JUST
NATURALLY DRAWN TO ME.

08:56.206 --> 09:00.871
LIKE BOYS TO NIKKI.
THAT'S AN EXPRESSION
IN MY COUNTRY.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.172
I'LL HELP YOU OUT,
AVERY.

09:02.172 --> 09:03.944
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES
TO FLIRTING,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.817
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
SOME PRETTY GOOD MOVES.

09:06.817 --> 09:10.621
ARE THOSE THE MOVES
YOU USED ON THE GIRL
WHO SPITS INTO PLANTS?

09:10.621 --> 09:12.122
HER NAME IS EMILY.

09:12.122 --> 09:13.624
HER NAME COULD BE "GLENDORA,

09:13.624 --> 09:14.725
QUEEN OF THE FAIRY PEOPLE,"

09:14.725 --> 09:16.256
BUT SHE STILL SPITS
INTO PLANTS,

09:16.256 --> 09:19.329
AND THAT'S THE PART
THAT STICKS WITH YOU.

09:19.329 --> 09:20.991
ENOUGH ABOUT PLANT-SPITTER.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.763
SORRY, TYLER,
IT DOES STICK WITH YOU.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.795
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO SUCK IT UP

09:24.795 --> 09:25.896
AND WORK TOGETHER TOMORROW

09:25.896 --> 09:28.138
SO EVERYTHING
GOES PERFECTLY WITH WES.

09:31.902 --> 09:34.975
YOUR DOG WATCHES
LACE AND TEARS?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.207
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T,
HE'S A DOG.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.049
HE JUST TURNED IT ON
ACCIDENTALLY.

09:39.049 --> 09:41.281
HA! LIKE HECTOR WAS
ACCIDENTALLY ELECTROCUTED

09:41.281 --> 09:43.784
BY THAT EEL IN HIS TOILET!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.656
WHY DIDN'T HE FLUSH?

09:45.656 --> 09:47.988
EVEN WITHOUT THE EEL,
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA!

09:52.262 --> 09:53.924
MOMMY, DADDY,

09:53.924 --> 09:55.726
I PICKED OUT SOME NEW NAMES
TO REPLACE CHLOE.

09:55.726 --> 09:57.898
TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE.
OKAY.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.831
ALEJANDRA VELASQUEZ
MARGARITA.

10:00.831 --> 10:03.233
I ALSO LIKE

10:03.233 --> 10:07.107
ANASTASIA KOLIKOVA
IVANOVICHNAYA!

10:08.078 --> 10:09.680
AND...

10:11.081 --> 10:12.783
GAIL.

10:13.684 --> 10:14.945
WE LIKE CHLOE.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.617
YOU'VE GOT TO LET THAT GO.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.089
LISTEN, CHLOE,
IF THIS IS ABOUT

10:19.089 --> 10:20.921
WANTING TO ESTABLISH
YOUR OWN IDENTITY,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.694
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE
YOUR NAME TO DO THAT.

10:23.694 --> 10:26.056
YOU CAN DRESS DIFFERENTLY,

10:26.056 --> 10:27.758
OR CHANGE YOUR HAIRSTYLE,

10:27.758 --> 10:30.060
OR DEVELOP
A SPEECH AFFECTATION.

10:30.060 --> 10:34.634
"HELLO,
MY NAME IS CHLOE."

10:34.634 --> 10:37.067
BENNETT,
HER CLOTHES ARE FINE,
SHE HAS ENOUGH ACCENTS.

10:37.067 --> 10:41.071
AND THE HAIR IS WHAT IT IS.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.913
YOU CAN TELL US
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM.

10:42.913 --> 10:44.344
WE'RE HERE
FOR YOU, CHLOE.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.647
I'M NOT CHLOE!
SORRY, GAIL!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.780
SHE'S REALLY
UPSET ABOUT THIS.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.783
I BETTER CALL HER TEACHER
AND SEE IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.655
( affected voice )
BUT WHEN I TALK TO HER,
I'M GOING TO TALK LIKE THIS.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.827
( affected voice )
THIS IS KIND OF FUN.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.759
IT IS, ISN'T IT?
WE SHOULD VACATION MORE.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.261
OH, LOOK, THE ROTHSCHILDS!

11:01.261 --> 11:03.233
WE SHOULD PLAY DOUBLES
SOMETIME!

11:03.233 --> 11:04.765
HI, COME--

11:04.765 --> 11:06.897
( awkward silence )

11:06.897 --> 11:08.839
I FORGOT MY BACKPACK.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.705
( affected voice )
WELL, THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.

11:14.705 --> 11:17.908
( affected voice )
YES! YES, IT WAS!

11:19.449 --> 11:21.782
THANKS AGAIN FOR
HELPING ME OUT WITH THIS.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.083
I'M KIND OF EMBARRASSED.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.454
I'M USUALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT SCHOOL.

11:24.454 --> 11:25.916
OH, NO PROBLEM.

11:25.916 --> 11:28.759
OR SHOULD I SAY
"NO PROBLEMO."

11:28.759 --> 11:32.893
SHOULD I? SHOULD I SAY
"NO PROBLEMO"?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.765
THAT'S NOT REAL SPANISH.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.767
I SHOULD NOT SAY
"NO PROBLEMO."

11:36.767 --> 11:38.368
IT'S NOT SPANISH.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.731
ONCE WE ELIMINATE
ALL THE WORDS THAT
ARE NOT SPANISH,

11:40.731 --> 11:42.432
WE'LL BE LEFT WITH
THE WORDS THAT ARE.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.474
IT'S PART OF MY SYSTEM.

11:44.474 --> 11:47.738
IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE,
JUST SAY "SI. MUCHO."

11:47.738 --> 11:49.309
IT MEANS "YES. VERY MUCH."

11:49.309 --> 11:50.741
YOU THINK I'M GONNA GET
IN TROUBLE?

11:50.741 --> 11:52.412
SI. MUCHO.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.714
YOU'RE NOT INSPIRING
A LOT OF CONFIDENCE.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.017
THAT'S WHY I NEED A TUTOR.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.391
TYLER, STOP TEXTING
YOUR PLANT-SPITTER.

12:01.391 --> 12:03.253
AVERY ALMOST BLEW IT
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

12:03.253 --> 12:05.826
HEY, I CAN HELP AVERY
AND TEXT THE PLANT-SPITTER.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.829
OH NO, I JUST SENT EMILY
A TEXT THAT SAYS

12:08.829 --> 12:11.131
"I CAN TEXT
THE PLANT-SPITTER."

12:11.131 --> 12:14.935
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
SHE TOOK IT AS A COMPLIMENT.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.238
SO, WES, ARE YOU READY
TO BEGIN OUR LESSON?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.370
TRY PLAYFULLY
INSULTING HIM.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.972
THE PLAYFULLY
SHOWS YOU LIKE HIM,

12:21.972 --> 12:24.114
AND THE INSULTING
SHOWS NOT TOO MUCH.

12:24.114 --> 12:26.746
OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU
DID WITH EMILY?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.078
YOU'RE SUCH A BABOON!

12:28.078 --> 12:29.219
WHAT SHOULD I CALL HIM?

12:29.219 --> 12:31.221
A BABOON?
YOU'RE A BABOON!

12:31.221 --> 12:32.923
THAT WASN'T FOR YOU.
I TAKE IT BACK.

12:32.923 --> 12:36.927
AND I SAID PLAYFULLY!
YOU'RE A BABOON!

12:38.328 --> 12:40.390
TELL HIM IT'S A PART
OF THE TUTORING.

12:40.390 --> 12:43.063
TELL HIM YOU WANT HIM
TO SAY "YOU'RE A BABOON"
IN SPANISH.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.534
THIS IS
PART OF THE TUTORING.

12:44.534 --> 12:47.798
I WANT YOU TO SAY
"YOU'RE A BABOON"
IN SPANISH.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.769
THAT COULD DEFINITELY
BE ON THE TEST.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.002
I'VE NEVER
HAD A TUTOR BEFORE,

12:52.002 --> 12:55.145
BUT THIS JUST SEEMS WRONG.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.848
PERFECT.
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE,

12:57.848 --> 13:00.510
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE ALERT,
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE LEARNING.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.913
IF YOU START TO FEEL
TOO COMFORTABLE, I'M
GONNA HAVE TO STARTLE YOU.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.784
BOO!

13:04.784 --> 13:07.117
WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU WON'T SEE IT COMING.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.459
BOO!

13:09.459 --> 13:12.522
IF THIS IS HOW YOU ARE
WITH GIRLS, I'M GLAD
I'M NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

13:12.522 --> 13:14.464
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

13:14.464 --> 13:16.466
YOU NEVER EVEN WANTED
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.468
SO WHAT IS SPANISH
FOR "BABOON"?

13:18.468 --> 13:21.201
SPANISH FOR "BABOON" IS...

13:21.201 --> 13:23.373
I JUST FEEL SORRY
FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
THAT'S ALL.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.505
YOU JUST PLAY GAMES
AND MANIPULATE PEOPLE.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.408
FIRST, LET'S DISCUSS
THE FIVE SPECIES OF BABOON.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.140
THERE'S THE YELLOW BABOON...

13:30.140 --> 13:32.212
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
WITH EMILY.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.813
SHE'S DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER GIRLS.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.085
SHE'S REALLY COOL

13:35.085 --> 13:36.917
AND SMART AND FUNNY...

13:36.917 --> 13:38.418
...AND THE CHACMA BABOON.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.491
LOOK, I ALREADY KNOW
ALL ABOUT BABOONS.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.293
YOU DO?

13:43.293 --> 13:45.555
OF COURSE YOU DO.

13:45.555 --> 13:49.329
OH, SO EMILY IS
THE FIRST "REALLY COOL"
GIRL YOU'VE EVER MET?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.031
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.563
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SAY YOU'RE JEALOUS.

13:53.563 --> 13:55.605
HA!
NOT SO LOUD!

13:55.605 --> 13:57.567
( whispering )
WHAT'S SPANISH FOR "BABOON"?

13:57.567 --> 14:00.040
YOU'RE NOT
UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH YET.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.611
( whispering )
NO, I THINK I AM.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.144
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.376
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I'M LEAVING.

14:06.376 --> 14:07.847
YOU ARE "EL BABUINO."

14:07.847 --> 14:09.049
WHAT'S THAT?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.620
IT'S SPANISH FOR "BABOON."

14:10.620 --> 14:12.452
FINALLY. EL BABUINO.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.225
IS THAT "BABOON"?
OF COURSE. WHY ELSE
WOULD I HAVE SAID IT?

14:15.225 --> 14:17.587
I'M NOT HERE TO WASTE
YOUR TIME.

14:17.587 --> 14:21.231
OH, AND BY THE WAY, NO ONE
REALLY LIKES YOUR HAIRCUT.

14:21.231 --> 14:22.862
OKAY, THAT IS A LIE!

14:24.064 --> 14:25.295
HELLO?

14:25.295 --> 14:26.536
HELLO, HELLO?

14:26.536 --> 14:28.969
¿HOLA? ¿HOLA, HOLA?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.571
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.079
HELLO?
NIKKI, TYLER,

14:39.079 --> 14:40.480
WHERE ARE YOU?

14:40.480 --> 14:43.583
OH, LOOK.
A MICROPHONE.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.515
TYLER? NIKKI?

14:45.515 --> 14:48.418
UH, THIS IS YOUR
CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

14:49.419 --> 14:53.623
WET SPILL ON AISLE 16.

14:53.623 --> 14:55.465
( imitates echo )
FALSE START...
START... START...

14:55.465 --> 14:57.567
NUMBER 82 OFFENSE...
FENSE... FENSE...

14:57.567 --> 15:00.400
STILL FIRST DOWN...
DOWN... DOWN...

15:00.400 --> 15:01.531
STAN?

15:01.531 --> 15:03.673
OH, HEY, AVERY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:03.673 --> 15:05.375
IS ELI STILL THERE?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.377
IT'S WES.
AND HE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

15:07.377 --> 15:10.480
HA! CLASSIC ELI.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.443
NIKKI AND TYLER
HAD A FIGHT AND BAILED.

15:13.443 --> 15:15.515
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
WHEN WES GETS BACK?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.617
WHO?
ELI!

15:17.617 --> 15:19.489
I WANT TO PLAY!

15:19.489 --> 15:21.491
IT'S NOT A GAME.
AVERY NEEDS HELP.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.523
YOU DON'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW SPANISH,
DO YOU?

15:23.523 --> 15:28.058
NO, BUT ALEJANDRA
VELASQUEZ MARGARITA DOES!

15:29.229 --> 15:30.600
READY TO GET BACK TO WORK?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.702
SI. MUCHO.

15:32.702 --> 15:36.606
THAT'S SPANISH?
THAT'S THE LANGUAGE OF
MY FAVORITE SOAP OPERA.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.639
LACE AND TEARS?
I LOVE THAT SHOW.

15:39.639 --> 15:44.174
"RICARDO, IT WAS YOU
WHO PUT THE EEL
IN MY COMMODE!"

15:44.174 --> 15:46.646
"NO, NO, NO!

15:46.646 --> 15:49.219
SI, SI, SI!"

15:50.280 --> 15:52.482
( dramatic gasp )

15:52.482 --> 15:55.155
( dramatic gasp )

15:59.159 --> 16:00.490
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:00.490 --> 16:03.633
LEARNING THE LANGUAGE
IS NOT ENOUGH.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.236
YOU MUST ALSO IMMERSE
YOURSELF IN THE CULTURE.

16:06.236 --> 16:07.637
NOW WE DANCE!

16:15.705 --> 16:17.107
BOO!

16:20.310 --> 16:22.552
I JUST SPOKE
WITH CHLOE'S TEACHER.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.554
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER WANTING TO
CHANGE HER NAME.

16:24.554 --> 16:28.488
( affected voice )
AND SHE DOESN'T APPRECIATE
SILLY-VOICE COMEDY.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.490
WELL, WHILE YOU WERE
TALKING TO HER TEACHER
LIKE A GOOD PARENT

16:30.490 --> 16:32.692
AND THEN ALSO
LIKE A CRAZY PARENT,

16:32.692 --> 16:36.396
I WAS BEING
AN EFFECTIVE PARENT
BY RANSACKING HER ROOM.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.199
BUT, ELLEN,
THAT IS A VIOLATION
OF THE TRUST THAT WE HAVE

16:39.199 --> 16:42.102
ESTABLISHED AS PARENTS --
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

16:42.102 --> 16:45.105
A SMALL BOX
PROPPED ON A STICK
NEXT TO HER PILLOW,

16:45.105 --> 16:47.037
WHICH I'M ASSUMING
WAS A TOOTH FAIRY TRAP

16:47.037 --> 16:48.578
BECAUSE THE BAIT
WAS A PILE OF TEETH.

16:49.739 --> 16:51.241
AND THIS.

16:51.241 --> 16:53.513
IT'S A CONTRACT
IN CRAYON STATING THAT

16:53.513 --> 16:55.585
CHLOE HAS GIVEN UP
THE RIGHT TO HER NAME.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.547
WHOEVER DREW THIS UP
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

16:57.547 --> 17:00.520
ALL THE T'S ARE CROSSED
AND ALL THE I'S ARE HEARTED.

17:02.052 --> 17:04.524
SWEETIE, WE FOUND THIS
IN YOUR ROOM.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.497
OKAY. THERE ARE FOUR
OTHER CHLOES IN MY CLASS,

17:07.497 --> 17:08.598
AND WE HAD A GAME OF TAG.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.460
LOSER CHANGES HER NAME.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.132
FOUR OTHER CHLOES?

17:12.132 --> 17:15.365
TALL CHLOE,
FAST CHLOE, STINKY CHLOE,
AND CHLOE TWO-SHOES.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.508
WE ALL WEAR TWO SHOES,
I DON'T GET THAT.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.670
SO, UH,
WHAT'S YOUR NICKNAME?

17:20.670 --> 17:22.372
DISTRACTED CHLOE.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.174
I FORGOT WE WERE PLAYING TAG
HALFWAY THROUGH AND--

17:24.174 --> 17:26.376
CAN I HAVE A SANDWICH?

17:26.376 --> 17:28.318
SWEETHEART,
THIS CONTRACT ISN'T REAL.

17:28.318 --> 17:30.320
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FOLLOW THIS.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.523
I HAVE TO HONOR
MY WORD. IT'S WHAT YOU GUYS
ALWAYS TAUGHT ME TO DO.

17:33.523 --> 17:36.186
BUT WE'VE TAUGHT YOU
SO MANY THINGS THAT
YOU DIDN'T LEARN.

17:36.186 --> 17:37.627
WHY DID THIS STICK?

17:37.627 --> 17:39.459
I TOLD YOU MY NAME
IS DISTRACTED CHLOE.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.790
WHERE'S MY SANDWICH?

17:40.790 --> 17:42.692
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING
TO GET MY NAME BACK.

17:42.692 --> 17:43.793
I'M GLAD WE HAD THIS TALK.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.195
KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT POOL.

17:46.596 --> 17:50.470
THAT WAS SOME GOOD PARENTING.
REALLY?

17:50.470 --> 17:53.673
WELL, THEY SAY HALF
OF PARENTING IS JUST BEING
THERE FOR YOUR KIDS.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.145
Tyler: MOM! DAD!

17:55.145 --> 17:57.677
COME LISTEN TO THIS
FUNKY SOUND MY NECK IS MAKING!

17:58.778 --> 18:00.280
SHH.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.512
THIS IS THE OTHER HALF.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.615
THANKS AGAIN
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

18:05.615 --> 18:07.457
SO, UH, HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

18:07.457 --> 18:09.088
OH, I DON'T THINK
YOU COULD PUT A PRICE

18:09.088 --> 18:12.722
ON WHAT I DID TO YOU--
FOR YOU-- TODAY.

18:12.722 --> 18:14.564
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET

18:14.564 --> 18:16.566
ANOTHER TUTOR
BEFORE THE TEST.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.868
AND NEXT TIME, ASK AROUND.
GET A RECOMMENDATION.

18:18.868 --> 18:20.730
MAYBE NOT SOMEONE
YOU MET IN A PARK.

18:25.475 --> 18:29.579
LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU EVEN
BEFORE I CAME HERE.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.711
I WROTE DOWN
HOW TO SAY IT IN SPANISH.

18:34.144 --> 18:40.190
¿SERIA INAPROPIADO
QUE LE PIDA A MI TUTOR
TENER UNA CITA?

18:40.190 --> 18:43.593
UH... SI. MUCHO.

18:43.593 --> 18:49.399
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

19:04.774 --> 19:06.676
HEY, AVERY.

19:06.676 --> 19:08.218
HEY.

19:08.218 --> 19:12.151
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR
RUNNING OUT ON YOU EARLIER.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.584
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT YOU MISSED.

19:14.584 --> 19:17.587
YOUR RANCH WAS TAKEN OVER
BY BANDITOS?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.290
WHAT?

19:20.290 --> 19:23.333
OH, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT EPISODE YET.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.736
I'M JUST TRYING TO TRANSLATE
THIS NOTE WES READ ME.

19:26.736 --> 19:31.541
IT SAYS: "WOULD IT BE
INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO ASK
MY TUTOR OUT ON A DATE?"

19:31.541 --> 19:32.672
THAT'S GREAT!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.644
NO, IT'S NOT!

19:34.644 --> 19:36.606
I SAID "SI. MUCHO."

19:36.606 --> 19:39.279
I SAID "YES, IT WOULD BE
INAPPROPRIATE."

19:39.279 --> 19:42.352
ACTUALLY, YOU SAID
"YES, VERY INAPPROPRIATE."

19:42.352 --> 19:44.654
THAT'S NOT BETTER, IS IT?

19:44.654 --> 19:47.217
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

19:47.217 --> 19:49.859
HE FINALLY ASKED ME OUT
AND I TURNED HIM DOWN.

19:49.859 --> 19:52.191
MAYBE YOU COULD TEXT HIM
AND EXPLAIN.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.865
EXPLAIN WHAT? HOW I LIED
ABOUT KNOWING SPANISH?

19:55.865 --> 19:58.328
THIS WHOLE THING
IS JUST TOO EMBARRASSING.

19:58.328 --> 20:01.401
I TOTALLY BLEW IT
WITH WES. AGAIN.

20:06.576 --> 20:08.638
OH, STAN.

20:08.638 --> 20:11.381
WOW. TODAY'S BEEN
A BAD DAY FOR ME, TOO.

20:11.381 --> 20:14.284
I THINK I'M JEALOUS
OF TYLER'S GIRLFRIEND.

20:24.554 --> 20:26.496
NOW THAT AVERY'S INTO BOYS,

20:26.496 --> 20:28.958
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT
LIKE A SPANISH SOAP OPERA
AROUND HERE.

20:28.958 --> 20:31.961
THERE'S GONNA BE A HEARTBREAK
EVERY 15 MINUTES,

20:31.961 --> 20:35.735
AND LOTS OF CHARMING SMILES
FROM HANDSOME HOMBRES.

20:36.966 --> 20:38.808
AND HELPING AVERY GAVE ME
A WHOLE NEW WAY

20:38.808 --> 20:40.770
TO STAY RELEVANT
WITH TYLER, TOO.

20:40.770 --> 20:43.473
( as teenage boy )
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO
DRIVE OUT TO THE LAKE?

20:43.473 --> 20:45.315
OF COURSE I WANT TO
DRIVE OUT TO THE LAKE.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.547
THAT SOUNDS
TOTALLY AWESOME.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.619
WAIT, WHAT LAKE?

20:49.619 --> 20:52.652
I DUNNO.
THIS TOWN STINKS.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.984
I CAN'T WAIT TILL
I HAVE MY OWN APARTMENT.

20:54.984 --> 20:56.956
I KNOW. ME, TOO.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.629
MAYBE I'LL GET ONE
BY THE LAKE!

20:59.629 --> 21:03.493
( laughing ) DUDE!
I AM SO THERE!

21:03.493 --> 21:05.995
Both: DUDE!

21:07.837 --> 21:10.039
WELL, I THINK THIS HAS
BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL

21:10.039 --> 21:12.442
FIRST GATHERING
OF THE CHLOES.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.043
BOY, YOU ALL
ATE A LOT.

21:14.043 --> 21:15.845
YOU'RE PRETTY FULL,
HUH?

21:15.845 --> 21:19.749
( all groaning )

21:19.749 --> 21:23.853
GAIL ALEJANDRA,
YOU DIDN'T EAT VERY MUCH.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.855
OH, I DIDN'T WANT TO FEEL
BLOATED FOR THE TAG REMATCH

21:25.855 --> 21:28.358
TO GET MY NAME BACK.

21:28.358 --> 21:30.720
OH, YEAH,
WHEN DOES THAT START?

21:30.720 --> 21:34.364
I BELIEVE IN THREE...
TWO... ONE... GO!

21:34.364 --> 21:38.398
Chloe: TAG... TAG...
TAG... TAG!

21:38.398 --> 21:39.829
I WIN!

21:39.829 --> 21:41.631
THEY SHOULDN'T CALL ME
DISTRACTED CHLOE,

21:41.631 --> 21:43.603
THEY SHOULD CALL ME
SMART CHLOE,

21:43.603 --> 21:46.936
BECAUSE-- WHOA, THOSE CHICKEN
BONES LOOK LIKE A DINOSAUR.
