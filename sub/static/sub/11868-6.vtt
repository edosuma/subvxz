Yeah, you said you wanted
to try yoga, not
miss three days of school.

01:59.286 --> 02:03.120
Well, I mean, Swami's at the
ashram only this week, and
I talked to all my teachers.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.533
They said I could make up
my schoolwork.

it was fine.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.327
We've been walking for,
like, an hour. We should
really go back.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.546
But don't you want to know
what this place is?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.380
I know it's creepy.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.000
Wait. Do you hear that?

12:01.137 --> 12:05.426
Yes, it's common sense
saying, "Get out, and go
to chemistry class."

12:05.558 --> 12:07.059
I think it's coming
from in here.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.096
Come on!
You never go toward
the creepy noise.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.140

a horror movie?

Did they get you?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.394
Yeah, Pilar,
the rats tripped me.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.310
Are you okay?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.479
No, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.194
Okay. Please,
can we go, now?

13:03.449 --> 13:04.484
ZOE: This way?

13:05.618 --> 13:08.735
Okay.
Which way is out?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.408
This way?
This way.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.122
Oh, that's just perfect!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.618
Dr. Gaz admitted that
he'd love to be a superhero,

13:16.754 --> 13:19.996
and he had access to
flying technology. What?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.294
Carter, everyone at G.D.
wants to be a superhero.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.011
It's part of being a
scientist, part of dreaming
up this kind of technology.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.970
Really? Everyone?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.924

13:36.858 --> 13:39.440
Heard about your radio woes,
and I have the answer
to your problem.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.105
An aspirin.
I could use it.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.604
That's a cyberkinetic
comlink.

Say goodbye to your
old, broken down radio
and cell phone,

13:47.035 --> 13:48.696
and hello to modern
convenience.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.284
I don't like
the sound of that.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.949
Thorne had you
on a list of
beta-testers.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.948
She figured you
could give it
a real-world workout.

about the person that
you want to call,

14:15.730 --> 14:16.719
and say their name.

a few kinks.

14:35.750 --> 14:41.586

with a "Z," or an "A," and
anything with an umlaut.

out of me, now.

It's different.

I am taking it seriously.

I'm just saying that you're
gonna be a mom, and your
whole life is gonna change.

I'll be the kind of mom

ruptured at some sort of

could set it off.

to shut it down

So, he's a bird, and
a fireman, and a ghost?

17:00.895 --> 17:03.477
I want to know
how a fueling pipe
suddenly bursts.

17:03.606 --> 17:07.565
As far as I can tell,
the fuel pipe was fractured
by a plasma surge,

17:07.693 --> 17:09.979
which I've never
seen before.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.687

did it deliberately?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.654
Someone, like,
in a cape?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.571
He's a vigilante,
and he's dangerous,
and he's a klutz,

17:17.703 --> 17:19.239
and unless I catch him,
this ends one of two ways.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.284

or he hurts someone else.

So, please, tell me about
your cutting-edge
firefighting technology.

17:25.419 --> 17:30.083
We have projects including
temperature-resistant fabrics,
fireproof gasoline.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.958
Do you have anything
that really blows?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.255
We have the best
blowers in the building.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.629
And that's for
scuba diving?

17:37.765 --> 17:40.381
For Maureen,
our robotic whale.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.928
She tracks
migration patterns.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.518
We developed high-energy
air-jets for her blowhole.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.979
I mean, they're small
enough to fit in
the palm of your hand.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.598

at Sea World.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.822

Now, she's in the
South China Sea, migrating
with a pod of sperm whales.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.364
She's a bit of a flirt.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.863

the spare blowholes?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.654
You took the words right
out of my mouth.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.691
Well, it looks like
G. D.'s only blowhole

19:17.823 --> 19:20.030
is currently vacationing
in the South China Sea.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.615
Oh, I miss Maureen.

19:21.744 --> 19:26.033
I ran a full inventory check.
Every nut and nuclear reactor
is accounted for.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.154
Well, how about
the rocket boots?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.997
Dr. Gaz was
telling the truth.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.663
All prototypes were discarded
when the project was shelved,

19:31.796 --> 19:33.661
and he was in his lab
all morning.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.629
Well, they had to come
from somewhere.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.669
Well, most superheroes
make their own equipment.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.839
He's not a superhero.
He's super dangerous.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.962
Yeah, but most
superheroes are also
misunderstood.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.384
That's why they hide
their identities.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.724
Plus, the ladies
love the latex.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.388
That's true.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.011
There is always
a girl around.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.432
Okay, I have real work to do.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.056
No, hear me out.
I mean, Superman had
Lois Lane. Right?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.434
Spiderman had, um...
Sally Jane.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.026
Mary Jane.
Don't you read at all?

19:58.155 --> 19:59.611
Okay, Carter,
what is your point?

19:59.740 --> 20:02.777
We find the
damsel in distress,
we find Captain Clumsy.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.743
This is truly sad, Jack.
Sad, sad, sad.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.486
Lex, this isn't about me.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.326
He's not a threat to
your manhood, Jack.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.073
You help people,
so does this guy.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.122
Of course, he does
do it anonymously,
which is a tad more noble.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.839
It's not gonna be so noble,
when somebody gets hurt,
especially if it's you.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.878
He's just trying to
keep people safe.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.796
How safe was it
to start that fire?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.008
I mean, Henry said that the
pipe was heated from the
outside, until it ignited.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.176
So, of course,
you assume...

20:26.308 --> 20:28.390
I also checked the road,
where you got trapped
in the car,

20:28.519 --> 20:30.931
and somebody did remove
all the warning signs.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.014
I think that this guy
wants to impress you,

20:35.693 --> 20:40.107
and given his talent for
screwing up, eventually,
you're gonna get hurt.

It's a drop-lock

21:58.901 --> 22:01.438
when the power runs out,
the doors shut tight.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.362
You knew about this,
and you didn't bring some
sort of extra power supply?

do you think I am?
It's in my bag.

is really gonna work?

that you were hurt
in the fire,

22:21.841 --> 22:24.423
and you blame
Captain Eureka
for the whole thing.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.009
He put out the word? How?
Bat Signal?

22:27.137 --> 22:32.222
(CHUCKLES) No, better.
He told Vincent, and made him
promise to keep it a secret.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.137
The crew of the
space station probably
knows by now.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.977
Hey.
Um, have you heard
from Zoe today?

22:37.106 --> 22:38.562
I would answer that,
but I'm in a coma.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.307
I'm serious, Lex.
I called Tesla. She never
showed up for school.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.853
I called her.
She's not picking up.

22:42.987 --> 22:46.400
Do they even let you
use cell phones
at this ashram?

22:46.532 --> 22:49.945
You think she went?
Good for her.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.863
Good for her?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.987
I need a coffee.
Good.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.331
You can't just show up
in her life and superimpose
your own morality.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.950
You don't even want her
to have a little bit of
independence.ldo.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.749
She's not your daughter.
And I want her to be safe.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.591
She's not lost in Baghdad.
She's an hour away
at a yoga retreat,

23:06.719 --> 23:07.754
and she's mad at you.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.094
I don't even know
if she got there. Do you?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.337
I'm sure she's fine.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.724
Well, this retreat
was your idea,

23:12.850 --> 23:16.092
so you can drive up there
and bring her home. Okay?

23:16.228 --> 23:19.641
I'm gonna go find Jo.
This whole ambush
is a bust.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.722
(SIGHS)

23:25.654 --> 23:26.905
How are you feeling?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.111
(GASPS)

23:29.533 --> 23:31.819
Oh, not so good, actually.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.739
Sorry, I didn't mean to
scare you.

23:34.872 --> 23:35.952
How did you get in here?

23:37.041 --> 23:42.877
I move like a jungle cat.
I'm sorry that you got hurt.
I hope you can forgive me.

23:43.005 --> 23:47.214
I'm fine.
I'm coma-free, honest.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.877
Okay, Jo will
drive you... Home.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.719
So sorry.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.087
Hold on.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.556
Take care.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.135
(GASPS)

24:01.148 --> 24:03.935
That's the creepiest thing
that's ever happened to me.

24:04.068 --> 24:07.606
I can't believe it.
He's gone.

24:07.738 --> 24:12.482
Not all of him.
Is that what
I think it is?

24:16.121 --> 24:17.110
Huh.

24:18.332 --> 24:22.041
Looks like Captain Eureka
gave us the finger.

24:22.252 --> 24:25.335
(SIGHS) What don't
you understand about,
"Look, don't touch?"

24:25.464 --> 24:27.580
I'm really sorry.

24:27.716 --> 24:32.176
Why? You just left us
in here to suffocate.
No biggie.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.596
It's okay.
I mean,
you didn't know.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.180
How much air do we have?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.298
Plenty.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.050
An hour, maybe two.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.393
An hour?

24:41.522 --> 24:42.511
(GRUNTS)

24:43.065 --> 24:44.396
Maybe longer.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.062
Oh, we'll be out of
there way before then,
right, Zane?

24:47.194 --> 24:48.434
You're working on
a plan.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.401
Well, I found the
U.L.F. transmitter.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.398
It can only send
numeric messages,
but

24:53.534 --> 24:55.991
it's a chance,
if we can get
power to it.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.985
The emergency batteries
are dry.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.032
Okay, what about
these lamps?

24:59.164 --> 25:03.533
Oh, they aren't electric.
They're chemical,
peroxyacid ester.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.952
Whoa!
Hey, I was writing my will.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.204
Is this enough power?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.123
Maybe.

25:11.802 --> 25:16.171
If we can network them.
Come on, give them up.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.302
lfthis works, it will only
give us a few seconds to
transmit to the outside.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.144
And we can only send numbers?

25:25.149 --> 25:26.104
Yeah.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.565
Okay, so what do we say?

25:29.069 --> 25:31.776
(CHUCKLES) You better
figure that out.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.528
No prints. Um...

25:37.661 --> 25:40.619
The collagen in
the skin ridges has
merged with the wall,

25:40.748 --> 25:44.206
and even the DNA has been
mangled beyond recognition.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.957
Well, it shouldn't be too
hard to find a nine-fingered
man in this town.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.546
Yeah, or one who can
walk through walls.
Uh...

25:51.675 --> 25:53.006
Any idea how he
pulled that off?

25:53.135 --> 25:55.751
Well, it's just
theory, but...

25:55.888 --> 26:00.632
Given the state of his finger,
I'm gonna say that he's using
some kind of quantum phasing.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.976
And now's the part
where I ask you to say it
in English.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.016
All matter in our universe
exists on a single,
quantum frequency.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.061
It allows us to interact
physically with things
around us.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.560
Our man might be
able to shift his
frequency just enough

26:12.696 --> 26:15.108
to allow him to
pass through
solid objects,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.572
like water through
a strainer.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.530
That didn't work too well
for Captain Nine Fingers.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.246
Well, part of it must have
shifted back to our frequency,
as he passed through the wall,

26:24.374 --> 26:26.239
and it got stuck.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.325
Any chance we can
reconstruct the DNA?

26:28.462 --> 26:32.125
Doubtful, but I can try.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.627
We don't have a
quantum phasing department,
Carter.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.923
Well, he didn't buy his
walk through walls machine
at Walk Through WalMart.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.262
Someone in this building
is working on something
like that.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.351
Well, Section Two was
developing a device
a couple of years ago,

26:43.477 --> 26:44.808
but the project was scrapped.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.804
They never built a fully
functional prototype.

26:47.940 --> 26:52.309
Well, his machine wasn't fully
functional, either, and we
have a finger to prove it.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.028
Huh.
He seems to specialize in
outdated G.D. technology.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.532
Wait. What happens
to a program
when it's scrapped?

27:00.661 --> 27:02.947
They lose their funding.
Scientists move on to
new projects.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.695
No, no.
To the things.

27:04.832 --> 27:08.324
The jet boots, the old
blowholes. You said
they built prototypes.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.002
Where are they?
Well, they're gone.
They're discarded.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.419
Discarded, or recycled?

27:15.884 --> 27:18.671
Why throw it away,
when you can "Chuck" it?

Oh, is that the DNA?

27:38.657 --> 27:43.902
No. No, your police radio
picked up a transmission from
an old military frequency.

27:43.912 --> 27:44.947
No. No, your police radio
picked up a transmission from
an old military frequency.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.160
Numbers?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.121
Yeah, now,
this first set of numbers,
I've seen before.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.239
They're longitude
and latitude.

27:49.376 --> 27:53.039
It's the same location
where Thorne had me
scan for radiation.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.332
Oh, what's the last number?

27:54.464 --> 27:55.453
4891. I don't know.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.424
I thought it was
an altitude or
a Z axis point,

27:58.552 --> 28:00.258
but none of that
makes sense.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.254

two sets of numbers are
trying to tell us something.

or from whom.

what you find.

lights are holding him
in our quantum frequency.

It wasn't easy
getting him out of
that wall in one piece,

29:16.338 --> 29:18.454
but this should keep him
with us for a while.

29:18.590 --> 29:24.085
Make sure you recycle
these bulbs. Mercury nitrate's
terrible for the planet.

about this?

see you, Chuck.

the world together.

as saving the girl.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.703
Hang in there.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.201
He actually incorporated
the phasing device
into the vest.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.998
Yes, the stolen
phasing device.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.463
But, it's still
a neat piece of
textile engineering.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.752
I mean, press a button,
and walk through walls?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.716
Yeah, but he wasn't
even wearing this suit
when we found him.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.007
Yeah, which is why
the original project
was discontinued.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.849
The device uses
molecular vibration to
change the quantum frequency.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.390
Now, after enough exposure,
the body adopts
the new frequency,

30:15.522 --> 30:17.478
and then starts phasing
uncontrollably.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.733
Well, he's already lost
a finger.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.066
I mean, he's not gonna start
leaving pieces all over town.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.059
Each of his molecules
is phasing randomly.

30:23.196 --> 30:26.529
Now, fortunately for him,
electricity can bridge
quantum frequencies.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.991
The only thing holding him
together is the current
within the cells.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.987
There's not gonna be enough
for long. He's headed for
full decoherence.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.988
I mean, he will
literally fall apart.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.286
We got to be able to do
better than growlights.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.705
Well, this is every file
from the original project.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.705
Every test subject ended up
phasing uncontrollably.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.002
Well, how did
they save them?

30:45.427 --> 30:46.462
They didn't.

30:46.595 --> 30:51.680
They tried everything, from
point energy treatments to
graviphotons. Nothing worked.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.719
But that doesn't mean
we're gonna give up trying.

I think I just made it worse.

would have left you a message.

tell him, or I swear to God,

It was longitude,
latitude, and 4891.

That's Zoe's birthday.
Can you help me?

32:17.227 --> 32:18.763
Of course.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.647
This complex is massive.
Pre-war, what? Late '30s?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.437

That's before Eureka was
built. What's down there?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.026
Nothing. These are the
only remaining records.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.897
The entire complex was
buried and forgotten
a long time ago.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.317
Well, until
Zoe found it.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.067
And the only access was
a collapsed elevator shaft.

32:35.203 --> 32:39.037
No, if we extrapolate from
these plans, there has to be
a utility shaft out from here.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.201
It would have been
sealed off.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.073
(CHUCKLES) No,
it's right under Tesla.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.666

the kids got in.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.786
If we open the doors...
Done.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.662
Carter, it's a huge facility.
We don't know where she is.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.380
They sent a U.L.F. signal.

32:49.509 --> 32:54.173
Which means the transmitter
has to be right here,
in the control room.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.303
If you only got one signal,
they probably lost power.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.847
How do you know
so much about it?

33:03.732 --> 33:08.021
Okay, so it's a droplock
system, standard security
before World War II,

33:08.153 --> 33:11.065
which means that, ifthe
complex is under attack
and loses power,

33:11.198 --> 33:12.813
the doors drop and lock.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.533
Yeah, and according to
the plans, the doors are 20
inches of titanium and steel.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.037
Okay, so we got to
cut through.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.495
No, not enough time.
Time for what?

33:20.624 --> 33:23.582
Carter, they're running out
of air. Those doors
are airtight.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.417
And I got the message
an hour ago.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.086
We got to figure out
how to get in there, now.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.626
If we restore power,
we can open the doors,

33:30.759 --> 33:33.000
which means we have to
turn the switch on in
the main generator,

33:33.136 --> 33:35.092
which is here,
in the generator room,

33:35.222 --> 33:38.635
which means you have to
get through.... One, two,
three, four doors.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.884
Yeah. We can't
cut that fast.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.635
What if we don't cut?

33:44.397 --> 33:47.104
I've got a crew pulling
the ND laser from
the fusion reactor.

33:47.234 --> 33:49.395
We'll have it in place
in a few hours
to melt the doors.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.314
That'll take too long.
With this, I can go
right through them.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.904
Yeah, but once you use the
device, your body will start
changing frequencies.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.993
I'll get in there.
I'll fire up the generator.
You can fix me later.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.033
But, we don't know how.
We're working on it.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.622
Look, Carter,
I can't lose you.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.457
You're not gonna lose me.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.378
If I don't come out,
I'll be stuck in a door,
easy to find.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.747
Okay, it's not funny.

34:11.883 --> 34:15.046
People have already died
because they couldn't find
a way to stop the phasing.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.636
They didn't have Henry and
you to work on the problem.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.346
I'll go.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.558
Chuck, stay
under the lights.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.975
Those photons are
the only thing
keeping you together.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.189
No. I can make it.
I want to help.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.479
Easy, Chuck.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.356
Let me take this one.
It's Zoe.

34:38.368 --> 34:39.357
(SIGHS)

34:40.203 --> 34:41.192
Okay.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.069
(SIGHS)

34:43.498 --> 34:44.487
Meet me there.

34:49.504 --> 34:54.294
He'll do fine.
I always felt really
brave in that suit.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.168
It's not the suit.

35:00.307 --> 35:04.175
We programmed the transmitter
for U.L.F., so we should
be able to talk to you.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.974
And the chances for
decoherence increase with
the density of the material.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.812
Got it.
What did he say?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.101
You're gonna end up
like Chuck.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.067
Going through steel walls
is only gonna make it
happen faster.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.856
Got it.
The steel will adhere to you,

35:15.989 --> 35:17.900
so no matter how much
it hurts, keep moving.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.615
If you stop,
you're gonna leave
pieces of yourself behind.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.201
Good tip.
Once you're inside the room,

35:23.330 --> 35:25.571
the generator switch
will be straight ahead.

35:25.707 --> 35:30.076
And, Jack,
please, don't screw up.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.200
Thanks.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.280
(GRUNTS)

36:10.669 --> 36:13.581
HENRY: You okay?
All in one piece.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.126
That really hurts.
That hurts.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.556
ZOE: Think they got
our message?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.476
I don't know.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.851
Two down.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.150
HENRY: The interior doors
are made of a thinner alloy,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.740
so you should have
less of a problem
going through them.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.276
(CARTER GROANING)

36:49.082 --> 36:53.621
The generator room
should be straight ahead,
about, oh, 90 meters.

36:53.753 --> 36:57.792
Jack, this door is
much thicker. It's
gonna hurt. Don't stop.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.425
Last door.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.679
(GRUNTS)

37:06.808 --> 37:09.015
I'm in.
I'm turning the vest off.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.386
The activation switch
should be somewhere
on the panel.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.937
CARTER: I'm looking.

37:15.567 --> 37:20.152
Uh... Intrinsic
Field Generator A.
I got it.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.489
"Start."
That's my kind of button.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.363
Uh...

37:29.205 --> 37:32.993
Tiny problem. My hand just
went through the console.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.286
He's phasing on his own.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.080
Yeah, I didn't think
it would happen so soon.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.624
Well, it did,
so what do we do?
Working on it, Jack.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.169
Hey, guys, I'm pretty far in.
Can ljust call Zoe?

37:41.301 --> 37:42.381
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

37:42.510 --> 37:44.626
What was that?
Nothing, just...

37:45.472 --> 37:48.134
Fargo's stupid phone.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.884
I swear, if! still have
hands when I get out of
here, I'm...

37:52.103 --> 37:54.059
Gonna kiss you.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.101
Uh, pardon?

37:57.233 --> 38:01.727
Henry, you said that
electricity can jump
quantum frequencies, correct?

38:01.863 --> 38:04.104
Yeah, that's what's
holding you together.

38:04.240 --> 38:09.155
Could I use the spark in
this implanted phone to
jump the start button?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.493
Yeah, that could close
the circuit.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.578
Yeah, or short out
the panel permanently,

38:12.707 --> 38:16.700
but, you know what,
we don't have time to fight
about it, so just try it.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.452
Okay, here's to
flipping a coin.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.304
Call Zoe.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.968
(POWERING UP)

38:35.730 --> 38:37.311
Doors are open!

38:44.113 --> 38:45.102
Right!

38:48.117 --> 38:49.323
(DOORS OPENING)

38:52.789 --> 38:54.074
CARTER: Zoe?

38:54.207 --> 38:55.242
Dad?

38:59.379 --> 39:00.494
(EXCLAIMS)

39:04.342 --> 39:06.879
I'm hallucinating.
Anyone else?

39:11.266 --> 39:14.133
Please tell me
you're really here.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.807
I'm really here.
I'm a little out of phase,
but...

39:20.859 --> 39:22.315
I'm here.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.183
(SIGHS)

39:26.906 --> 39:28.237
I'm so sorry
I went in there.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.109
I was mad and
stupid and...

39:32.245 --> 39:33.234
(CHUCKLES)

39:33.371 --> 39:34.907
I was trying to
prove something.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.246
Honey, it's not that bad.

39:37.375 --> 39:42.165
And when things went wrong,
you kept a clear head.
I'm proud of you.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.871
(LAUGHS)
But that doesn't look good.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.000
We've isolated a
frequency that will
stabilize the phasing.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.377
Uh-huh?
So, you did solve it?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.761
We just needed the
right motivation.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.758
It was a tricky problem.
I mean, had we been off by
one cycle per second,

39:55.894 --> 39:59.136
we would have accelerated
the decoherence.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.054
Oh, I'm a guinea pig?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.851
No. No, we've already
tested it.

40:02.984 --> 40:08.320
He insisted that we
try it on him, first.
Brave man.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.273
Sleep well, Captain Eureka.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.363
Oh. And, Jack.
Yeah?

40:14.495 --> 40:16.952
I fixed your old radio.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.530
Thanks.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.283
(GRUNTS)

40:29.469 --> 40:30.504
DOCTOR: Open wide.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.969
Well, I guess I made it
out in one piece.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.086
Yeah.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.299
(SNIFFLES)
You okay?

40:37.435 --> 40:40.768
When I didn't know
where she was,
I was just really scared.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.309
Oh. She's okay.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.772
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.062
Seriously, I don't know
if I'm ready to be Mom.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.026
You'll be fine.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.736
It gets easier?

40:50.865 --> 40:54.153
No. No, not in the least.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.241
But you adapt, you know?

40:56.371 --> 40:57.736
And...

40:58.206 --> 41:01.949
And you're right.
Look, she can take
care of herself.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.326
I hear Zoe's
going to recover.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.248
Yeah, she's fine.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.212
Thank goodness
for that.

41:08.341 --> 41:10.707
Ms. Thorne? Um...

41:12.261 --> 41:16.504
Ever since you got to
this town, you've been
looking for something.

41:17.558 --> 41:21.551
Now, I believe that
everyone has the right
to their own secrets,

41:21.688 --> 41:26.352
but, today,
four kids almost died.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.984
Tell me what's going on.

41:32.699 --> 41:33.688
No.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.237
That's it? Just, no? No?

41:40.373 --> 41:44.366
Sheriff Carter, I'm very sorry
for what happened to Zoe.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.914
I never wanted anyone
to be hurt by this.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.245
You've got to believe that.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.376
I do.

41:52.969 --> 41:57.338
And you got to believe
that I'm not gonna
let this go.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.922
Good day.
