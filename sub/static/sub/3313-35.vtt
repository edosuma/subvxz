WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:08.588
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED

00:08.589 --> 00:09.969
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.970 --> 00:12.132
CHARLIE, THAT SOUNDS
AWESOME, MAN.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.724
YEAH, LET ME JUST RUN IT
BY MY BRIDE-TO-BE FIRST.

00:14.725 --> 00:17.397
HEY, WILL YOU STOP MAKING
THAT WHIPPING SOUND, PLEASE?

00:17.398 --> 00:20.191
LETTING MEL KNOW MY SCHEDULE IS NOT
THE SAME THING AS HANDING OVER MY...

00:21.902 --> 00:24.023
THEM. BYE.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.905
HEY, THESE CAME FOR AUNT MEL.
THEY'RE FROM GRANDPA RUSSELL.

00:25.906 --> 00:27.407
OH.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.199
"PUMPKIN, I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW
TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.950
SORRY I MISSED TODAY'S
FLIGHT, THINGS GOT CRAZY

00:30.951 --> 00:33.203
WITH THE QANTAS GIRLS

00:33.204 --> 00:35.285
IN THE FREQUENT FLYER LOUNGE."

00:35.286 --> 00:39.289
MAN, GRANDPA RUSSELL IS SO COOL.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.252
AND QUITE A ROLE MODEL.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.374
HEY, UH, WHERE IS YOUR AUNT?

00:44.375 --> 00:45.835
OH, SHE'S UPSTAIRS

00:45.836 --> 00:47.927
WITH YOUR MOM AND SISTER
DOING BRIDE CRAP.

00:47.928 --> 00:49.339
OH.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.721
OKAY, SO... HAIR DOWN

00:51.722 --> 00:53.093
OR HAIR UP?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.385
MY JOEY'S BRIDE LOOKS GORGEOUS

00:55.386 --> 00:57.557
- NO MATTER HOW SHE WEARS HER HAIR.
- AWW.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.180
MA, THE DAY BEFORE THE
WEDDING IS NO TIME FOR B.S.

01:00.181 --> 01:01.981
- WEAR IT DOWN.
- THANKS.

01:01.982 --> 01:04.604
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MAKE VERY
GOOD DECISIONS ON A JUICE FAST.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.276
OH, YOU'RE NOT STICKING
TO THAT JUICE FAST

01:06.277 --> 01:08.067
AT THE BACHELORETTE
PARTY TONIGHT, ARE YOU?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.029
YOUR BREATH SMELLS
LIKE LAWN CLIPPINGS.

01:10.030 --> 01:12.071
- ( knocks )
- HEY, MEL, LISTEN, I GOTTA TALK...

01:12.072 --> 01:13.993
- OH MY GOD, JOEY!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

01:13.994 --> 01:15.575
- Both: GET OUT!
- HEY!

01:15.576 --> 01:17.407
IT'S BAD LUCK FOR YOU TO SEE

01:17.408 --> 01:18.698
THE BRIDE IN HER DRESS

01:18.699 --> 01:19.869
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.251
I GOTTA TALK TO
HER FOR A MINUTE.

01:21.252 --> 01:22.702
- TALK FROM THE HALL!
- GET OUT!

01:22.703 --> 01:25.586
- ALL RIGHT! I WANTED... MOM!
- ( mother yells )

01:28.259 --> 01:29.509
MEL?

01:29.510 --> 01:31.050
- YEAH?
- LISTEN, UH...

01:31.051 --> 01:33.133
INSTEAD OF A BACHELOR PARTY,
CHARLIE'S JUST TAKING ME OUT

01:33.134 --> 01:35.054
FOR A LITTLE LAST DAY
OF ADVENTURE, OKAY?

01:35.055 --> 01:37.016
HAVE FUN, BUT PROMISE
ME NOTHING DANGEROUS.

01:37.017 --> 01:39.269
DON'T GO BREAKING ANY PARTS I'M
GONNA NEED ON THE HONEYMOON.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.563
YEAH, DON'T WORRY, I'LL KEEP ALL THE
GOOD STUFF IN BUBBLE WRAP FOR YOU, BABY.

01:44.525 --> 01:45.525
WHAT?

01:45.526 --> 01:47.607
HE SAW YOU IN THE DRESS.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.150
OH, COME ON, IT'S
JUST A SUPERSTITION.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.401
OH, NOT SO.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.733
VINNY ZIRPOLO SAW HIS
FIANCEE IN HER DRESS

01:53.734 --> 01:56.866
BEFORE THE WEDDING. HE GOT HIT BY
LIGHTNING ON THE WAY TO THE CHURCH.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.619
HE DIDN'T LIKE WOMEN AFTER THAT.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.241
WELL, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THAT WITH JOE.

02:01.242 --> 02:05.455
FABIO MARCOTULLI SAW HIS FIANCEE
IN HER DRESS BEFORE THE WEDDING.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.627
AFTER THE CEREMONY, SHE GOT RICE

02:07.628 --> 02:10.460
THROWN IN HER EYE
AND WENT BLIND.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.342
WITH THIS JUICE FAST, IF
ANYONE STARTS THROWING RICE

02:12.343 --> 02:13.923
I'M GONNA CATCH IT IN MY MOUTH.

02:13.924 --> 02:15.715
UGH, I MISS CHEWING.

02:15.716 --> 02:18.928
YOU KNOW, JOEY SAW TIFFANY IN
HER DRESS BEFORE THE WEDDING.

02:18.929 --> 02:21.100
MM-HMM AND HOW'D THAT
MARRIAGE WORK OUT, HUH?

02:21.101 --> 02:22.763
- HUH? HMM?
- HUH? EH?

02:24.355 --> 02:27.527
SO... I'M GETTING A NEW DRESS.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.713
WHEN YOU CAN GET A
TOTALLY AWESOME SUIT

02:53.714 --> 02:56.095
AT THE THRIFT STORE
FOR LIKE 12 BUCKS.

02:56.096 --> 02:58.428
IS THAT A BLOODSTAIN?

02:58.429 --> 03:01.140
YEAH, I THINK SOME
GUY GOT SHOT IN IT.

03:01.141 --> 03:04.894
OH, AND THEY THREW
IN THIS AWESOME FEZ

03:04.895 --> 03:07.767
FOR FREE.

03:07.768 --> 03:09.649
WHICH YOU ARE NEVER
WEARING IN PUBLIC.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.112
OKAY, YEAH, WE'LL SAVE
IT FOR PRIVATE TIME.

03:14.575 --> 03:16.946
HEY, GUESS WHO ARRIVED
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE OUT?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.908
JOE'S SISTER THERESA...

03:18.909 --> 03:21.872
AND HER SON MARCO.

03:22.953 --> 03:23.993
OH.

03:23.994 --> 03:26.376
SO WHO'S "MARCO"?

03:26.377 --> 03:28.788
UH, JOE'S NEPHEW. WHEN
WE WENT TO NEW JERSEY

03:28.789 --> 03:30.590
LAST YEAR, MARCO SHOWED ME
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:30.591 --> 03:31.881
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S
NOT ANY BIG DEAL.

03:31.882 --> 03:33.753
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
EVEN REMEMBER ME.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.926
I THOUGHT I HEARD
AN ANGEL'S VOICE.

03:37.838 --> 03:40.680
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR EYES ARE SPARKLING

03:40.681 --> 03:43.102
EVEN MORE THAN THE
LAST TIME I SAW THEM?

03:43.103 --> 03:44.143
LOOK AT THAT, HE REMEMBERS YOU.

03:44.144 --> 03:46.766
YEAH. HEY, MARCO.

03:46.767 --> 03:49.309
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY BOYFRIEND ZANDER.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.060
HER LONG-TERM BOYFRIEND ZANDER.

03:51.061 --> 03:52.772
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT.

03:52.773 --> 03:56.065
THE ONE SHE WAS ON
THE PAUSE FROM.

03:56.066 --> 03:59.779
YES, BUT NOW WE ARE
VERY UN-PAUSED.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.621
GOT IT. BY THE WAY,

04:01.622 --> 04:02.783
NICE HAT, ALADDIN.

04:05.456 --> 04:06.916
( Joe laughing )
OH MAN, CHARLIE.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.628
I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING, BUDDY.

04:08.629 --> 04:11.040
THAT WAS THE BEST NON-BACHELOR
PARTY I COULD EVER HAVE.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.962
DUDE, YOU WERE A
MADMAN OUT THERE.

04:12.963 --> 04:14.634
WHAT, DO YOU GOT A DEATH WISH?

04:14.635 --> 04:16.255
OH YEAH, CLEARLY YOU DO.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.257
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.799
WHAT A SWEET THOUGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.011
I SHOULD HAVE YOU WRITE MY VOWS.

04:22.723 --> 04:25.054
( muttering ) STUPID...

04:25.055 --> 04:26.686
HEY, ZANDER. YOU DID PRETTY GOOD

04:26.687 --> 04:28.648
FOR YOUR FIRST RIDE
OUT THERE, BUDDY.

04:28.649 --> 04:30.059
AND WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.891
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU TRIED
TO RUN ME OFF THE ROAD.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.393
OH, YOU DIDN'T NOTICE?

04:33.394 --> 04:35.395
WE WERE ALL OFF-ROAD.

04:35.396 --> 04:36.856
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO, OKAY?

04:36.857 --> 04:38.107
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
ME OUT OF THE WAY.

04:38.108 --> 04:41.781
IF THIS IS ABOUT ME AND
LENNOX, TRUST ME...

04:41.782 --> 04:43.323
NOTHING HAPPENED.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.705
( Ryder laughs )

04:45.706 --> 04:48.708
IT'S FUNNY HOW HE MAKES
"NOTHING" SOUND LIKE SOMETHING.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.621
( laughs mockingly )
YEAH, IT'S HILARIOUS.

04:51.622 --> 04:54.414
GUYS, THIS ENDS
RIGHT NOW, COME ON.

04:54.415 --> 04:57.917
AND LISTEN, WHEN WE GET BACK,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY

04:57.918 --> 04:59.839
IS NEVER SPOKEN ABOUT AGAIN.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.421
YOU GOT IT?

05:01.422 --> 05:02.592
I SAID YOU GOT IT?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.013
- YEAH, SURE.
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

05:04.014 --> 05:07.056
RYDER, I GOTTA SAY
I'M PRETTY PROUD.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.019
YOU REMEMBERED EVERYTHING I SAID
ABOUT BEING SAFE OUT THERE.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.691
YEAH, I DID. HEY, UP TOP.

05:11.692 --> 05:12.692
YEAH!

05:12.693 --> 05:14.354
OH!

05:14.355 --> 05:16.195
OH MY GOD. IS THE BIKE OKAY?

05:16.196 --> 05:18.938
YEAH, THAT'S THE CONCERN...
THE BIKE.

05:18.939 --> 05:21.651
UH-HUH, WILL THE BIKE BE ABLE TO
WALK DOWN THE AISLE TOMORROW?

05:21.652 --> 05:23.863
OH... OH...

05:23.864 --> 05:25.034
I GOT IT. I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

05:25.035 --> 05:26.907
I'M... OH!

05:30.751 --> 05:33.212
OKAY, NOBODY CAN EVER TELL JOE
THAT I SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY

05:33.213 --> 05:35.334
ON A SECOND DRESS BECAUSE
OF SOME SILLY SUPERSTITION.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.957
WELL, ISN'T JOEY GONNA KNOW YOU'RE
WEARING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRESS?

05:37.958 --> 05:39.298
NO, HE'S A GUY.

05:39.299 --> 05:43.092
ALL THEY NOTICE IS DRESS
AND WHITE AND CLEAVAGE.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.304
SHE'S NOT WRONG.

05:45.305 --> 05:47.597
JOE, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO DANCE IN TIME

05:47.598 --> 05:49.889
- FOR THIS WEDDING TOMORROW?
- YES, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

05:49.890 --> 05:52.562
LOOK, CHARLIE KNOWS THIS
GUY, HE'S A DOCTOR.

05:52.563 --> 05:54.474
WELL, HE'S SORT OF A DOCTOR,

05:54.475 --> 05:56.065
ALL OF HIS PATIENTS ARE HORSES.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.027
BUT HE SAID HE'S GOT
THIS CONCOCTION

05:58.028 --> 06:00.069
THAT WILL FOR SURE HAVE ME
ON MY FEET BY TOMORROW.

06:00.070 --> 06:02.241
SO HERE, HE GAVE ME
THE ADDRESS THERE.

06:02.242 --> 06:03.823
OKAY. HEY, LET'S GET
YOU TO THE COUCH.

06:03.824 --> 06:04.984
I CAN GET MYSELF TO THE COUCH.

06:04.985 --> 06:07.617
JUST GO GET ME MY HORSE DRUGS.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.328
JOE, ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS A REAL DOCTOR?

06:09.329 --> 06:12.041
HIS ADDRESS JUST
SAYS, "BEIGE VAN."

06:12.042 --> 06:13.953
WILL YOU JUST GO, PLEASE?

06:13.954 --> 06:15.125
OKAY.

06:18.839 --> 06:20.420
JOE, YOU'RE HOME. HIDE IT.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.552
YES, AND I'M FINE. HIDE WHAT?

06:22.553 --> 06:24.634
OH, I... I CAN'T
HIDE MY FEELINGS

06:24.635 --> 06:26.806
- FOR YOU, SWEETIE.
- OH.

06:26.807 --> 06:28.808
SO WE SHOULD PRACTICE OUR
FIRST DANCE RIGHT NOW.

06:28.809 --> 06:30.600
WHOA, NOW? NO, NOW
WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA.

06:30.601 --> 06:32.972
- WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MUSIC, SWEETIE.
- OH, WELL...

06:32.973 --> 06:35.065
- ( dance music playing )
- NOW WE DO.

06:37.227 --> 06:39.779
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.401
READY? HERE WE GO.
HEY, YEAH, GOOD GOOD.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.073
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S
UNBELIEVABLE.

WOW.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.831
THERE WE GO, YEAH.

06:51.832 --> 06:54.744

06:54.745 --> 06:55.745
YEP YEP... OH!

06:55.746 --> 06:56.876
OW! OKAY.

06:56.877 --> 06:58.167

06:58.168 --> 07:00.419
NO NO NO NO NO. I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.921
CAN YOU STAND?

07:01.922 --> 07:02.962
YEP.

07:02.963 --> 07:06.095

07:06.096 --> 07:08.347

07:08.348 --> 07:09.679
SEE?

07:09.680 --> 07:10.720
( gasps )

07:10.721 --> 07:12.472
OH NO, WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

07:12.473 --> 07:14.684
OH, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, HONEY.
IT'S... IT'S...

07:14.685 --> 07:16.606
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. YOU
JUST HAPPENED TO STEP ON

07:16.607 --> 07:19.609
THIS OLD BONE SPUR THAT
I HAVE FROM THIS...

07:19.610 --> 07:21.270
THIS OLD...

07:21.271 --> 07:23.563
- KICKBOXING INJURY.
- WHAT?

07:23.564 --> 07:25.695
- WHEN DID YOU EVER KICKBOX?
- YEAH, IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.196
I'M IN A LOT OF
PAIN HERE, SWEETIE.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.368
I'M SUCH A KLUTZ.
I CAN'T BELIEVE

07:29.369 --> 07:31.370
I WASN'T MORE CAREFUL THE
DAY BEFORE OUR WEDDING.

07:31.371 --> 07:33.032
OH, YEAH, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

07:33.033 --> 07:35.034
I'LL BE BACK ON MY
FEET BY TOMORROW.

07:35.035 --> 07:37.166
OH, THAT'S MY JOE.

07:37.167 --> 07:38.998
SO BRAVE...

07:38.999 --> 07:41.250
AND SO DELUSIONAL. YOU
CAN'T EVEN STAND.

07:41.251 --> 07:42.962
MAYBE WE SHOULD
POSTPONE THE WEDDING.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.544
NO NO NO NO NO.

07:44.545 --> 07:46.465
LOOK, HONEY, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

I WAS GONNA STEP

07:50.931 --> 07:53.013

MY VERB TENSES, SWEETIE.

08:08.949 --> 08:10.740

08:12.452 --> 08:13.913
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.996
MAYBE YOURS A LITTLE.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.546
SO WHAT DID ALL YOU GUYS DO FOR
YOUR BIG SECRET ADVENTURE?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.217
AH, YOU KNOW, BOY STUFF.

08:28.218 --> 08:30.390
YOU HAVE MUD IN YOUR EAR.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.014
DIRTY BOY STUFF.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.598
- THERE SHE IS.
- GRANDMA, CAN I TAKE THIS OFF NOW?

08:38.599 --> 08:40.560
NOT YET. YOU AND LENNOX

08:40.561 --> 08:42.942
ARE A COUPLE IN
THE PROCESSIONAL.

08:42.943 --> 08:44.854
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PRACTICED.

08:44.855 --> 08:47.987
DO YOU TWO EVEN KNOW HOW YOU'RE
GONNA WALK DOWN THE AISLE?

08:47.988 --> 08:50.990
OH WELL, I WAS THINKING THAT
I'D GO WITH RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT.

08:50.991 --> 08:53.072
HEY, ME TOO.

08:53.073 --> 08:54.994
HAR-DEE-HAR.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.116
LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

08:58.418 --> 09:00.960
UM... YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
I CAN WING IT TOMORROW.

09:00.961 --> 09:03.042
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
WE'LL HAVE ANY TROUBLE

09:03.043 --> 09:05.125
MOVING TOGETHER RHYTHMICALLY.

09:08.218 --> 09:11.051
OH! I JUST GOT THAT.
( laughing )

09:12.432 --> 09:15.134
OH, YOU BAD BOY.

09:15.135 --> 09:17.727
I'LL LEAVE THE TWO OF
YOU TO PRACTICE ALONE.

09:17.728 --> 09:20.941
I'M RIGHT HERE.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.983
YEAH, YOU KNOW, MARCO,
I DON'T KNOW WHY

09:23.984 --> 09:26.145
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING THINGS LIKE
THERE'S SOME HIDDEN MEANING.

09:26.146 --> 09:28.397
YEAH, IT'S LIKE IN HIS MIND
HE THINKS HE'S YOUR...

09:28.398 --> 09:30.189
JERSEY BOYFRIEND.

09:30.190 --> 09:31.692
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

09:34.114 --> 09:35.115
NOTHING.

09:36.997 --> 09:39.248
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA BE HONEST. YOU
KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THAT GUY?

09:39.249 --> 09:40.751
NOTHING.

09:46.506 --> 09:48.337
PSST, JOE.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.049
GOT THE STUFF.

09:50.050 --> 09:51.631
YOU CAN STOP
WHISPERING, ALL RIGHT.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.342
MEL AND THE LADIES ARE STILL
OUT ON THEIR PUB CRAWL.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.595
BUT TALKING LIKE THIS
IS STILL KINDA FUN.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.218
OKAY. HERE IT IS.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.020
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE. THAT...
THAT'S A SHOT.

10:01.021 --> 10:03.313
- THERE'S NO PILLS?
- JOE, ARE YOU AFRAID OF NEEDLES?

10:04.725 --> 10:05.775
NO.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.276
NO!

10:07.277 --> 10:08.688
IT'S OKAY IF YOU ARE, YOU KNOW?

10:08.689 --> 10:10.529
EVERYONE'S SCARED OF SOMETHING.
I'VE GOT A FEAR.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.732
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT.
- WAX DUMMIES.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.784
WHAT PART OF "I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ABOUT IT" WAS UNCLEAR TO YOU?

10:14.785 --> 10:16.535
ONE TIME WE WENT ON
THIS TRIP TO NEW YORK.

10:16.536 --> 10:19.118
WE WALK INTO THE
WAX MUSEUM, RIGHT?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.912
AND THERE'S LARRY KING. AND
HE'S JUST SITTING THERE LIKE...

10:26.166 --> 10:28.127
I'M LOOKING AT HIM,
HE'S STARING AT ME

10:28.128 --> 10:30.379
AND I SEE THE BEADS OF SWEAT
DRIPPING DOWN HIS FACE.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.172
I MEAN, WHY DO THEY GOTTA PUT
BEADS OF SWEAT ON HIM, YOU KNOW?

10:33.173 --> 10:36.636
IT'S LIKE NO 12-YEAR-OLD NEEDS
TO SEE A WET LARRY KING.

10:39.099 --> 10:40.469
( sighs )

10:40.470 --> 10:42.471
CLEARLY YOU WERE SCARRED.

10:42.472 --> 10:44.063
- WELL, MY POINT...
- OH GOOD.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.145
...IS EVERYONE'S GOT
FEARS, YOU KNOW?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.027
YOU NEED THIS SHOT, JOE.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

10:48.028 --> 10:49.438
YOU'RE GONNA GET
BETTER FOR THE DANCE.

10:49.439 --> 10:51.190
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T GIVE
THE SHOT TO MYSELF.

10:51.191 --> 10:54.074
SO... IF I'M GETTING THE SHOT...

10:55.615 --> 10:57.076
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.

10:57.077 --> 10:58.739
AWESOME.

11:02.743 --> 11:04.163
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.335
WATCHED A LOT OF
"GREY'S ANATOMY."

11:07.547 --> 11:09.588
OKEYDOKEY, PUT YOUR LEG UP.

11:09.589 --> 11:11.170
I'M RETHINKING THIS.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.712
DO YOU WANNA GET BETTER OR NOT?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.213
OKAY, FINE.

11:14.214 --> 11:16.215
ALL RIGHT.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.057
( clears throat ) OKAY, ON
THE COUNT OF FIVE, OKAY?

11:18.058 --> 11:19.348
- SO WE'RE GOING ON FIVE?
- YEAH.

11:19.349 --> 11:20.970
OKAY, FIVE. ALL RIGHT, READY.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.011
- ONE...
- MM-HMM.

11:22.012 --> 11:23.223
- TWO!
- WHAT THE...

11:24.895 --> 11:27.227
- WHAT HAPPENED TO FIVE?
- OOH, I GOT EXCITED.

11:31.111 --> 11:32.571
( women laughing )

11:32.572 --> 11:34.864
WOOO! WOOO!

11:34.865 --> 11:36.736
WHO KNEW TOLEDO HAD
SUCH A NIGHTLIFE?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.117
I DID.

11:38.118 --> 11:40.079
OH, AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.162
- I LOVE YOU, JACKIE-WACKIE.
- I LOVE YOU, MELLY-BELLY.

11:43.163 --> 11:45.875
NOW YOU GET SOME SLEEP BEFORE
YOUR BIG DAY TOMORROW.

11:45.876 --> 11:48.788
GOD, THE ROOM IS SPINNING.

11:48.789 --> 11:50.459
MAYBE ONE MORE DRINK
WILL SLOW IT DOWN.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.251
OH HEY, STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP.

11:52.252 --> 11:54.383
- I'M GOING BACK TO THE BAR.
- AT 2:00 A.M.?

11:54.384 --> 11:56.135
WELL, THERE'S NO
ONE IN THIS ROOM

11:56.136 --> 11:58.098
I WANNA HOOK UP WITH.
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE.

11:59.389 --> 12:01.140
- HERE, MA.
- OH, NO THANKS.

12:01.141 --> 12:04.013
I'M TOO MUCH OF A LADY
TO PUKE IN A TRASH CAN.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.936
GOOD NIGHT, MISS BURKE.

12:06.937 --> 12:09.228
OH, "MISS BURKE."

12:09.229 --> 12:11.851
LAST TIME YOU'LL BE
HEARING THAT, HUH?

12:11.852 --> 12:14.113
- GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.
- GOOD NIGHT.

12:14.114 --> 12:16.735
UGH, IT WAS AWESOME HEARING
ALL THOSE CHILDHOOD STORIES

12:16.736 --> 12:18.067
ABOUT JOE.

12:18.068 --> 12:20.069
AND IT WAS SO ADORABLE
THAT HE USED TO CARRY

12:20.070 --> 12:22.031
A BRIEFCASE IN FOURTH GRADE.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.574
YEAH, IT WAS FILLED
WITH FRUIT ROLL-UPS

12:25.575 --> 12:28.247
AND STRING CHEESE.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.000
- ( both laughing )
- JOE WOULD BE SO EMBARRASSED

12:31.001 --> 12:32.872
IF HE KNEW YOU TOLD
ME ALL HIS SECRETS.

12:32.873 --> 12:34.794
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
EVERYTHING ABOUT JOE.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.217
I MEAN, EVEN JOE DOESN'T
KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT JOE.

12:38.969 --> 12:41.051
THIS COUCH IS VERY SLEEPABLE.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.763
- WAIT WAIT WAIT. NO NO NO, NO SLEEPING.
- OH.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.555
YOU CAN'T JUST TEASE
ME AND PASS OUT.

12:46.556 --> 12:49.098
I HAD ENOUGH OF THAT IN COLLEGE.

12:49.099 --> 12:52.021
SO WHAT DOESN'T JOE
KNOW ABOUT JOE?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.023
OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.065
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.069
TURN THE KEY AND THROW
AWAY THE ZIPPER.

13:00.610 --> 13:02.321
( yawning ) YOU'LL
NEVER GUESS IT EITHER.

13:02.322 --> 13:04.904
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS THAT JOE
HAS A 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

13:04.905 --> 13:06.456
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.119
( giggles ) WHOOPSIE.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.121
I DID NOT SAY THAT.

13:12.122 --> 13:15.294
WAIT, JOE HAS A DAUGHTER?!

13:15.295 --> 13:16.916
SHH.

13:16.917 --> 13:17.917
NO, WHAT...

13:17.918 --> 13:19.178
HOW? WHERE?

13:19.179 --> 13:21.090
WHO'S THE MOM? YOU
GOTTA TELL ME MORE.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.302
DON'T START WITH ME, MA.
I'M TIRED.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.473
WHAT? NO, OKAY.

13:24.474 --> 13:25.925
DON'T SLEEP. DON'T SLEEP.

13:25.926 --> 13:28.097
THERESA! HEY HEY!

13:28.098 --> 13:30.189
COME ON. COME ON.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.192
( snores )

13:39.860 --> 13:41.070
THERESA!

13:41.071 --> 13:42.862
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

13:42.863 --> 13:44.073
HEY...

13:44.074 --> 13:45.364
- HEY.
- HEY.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.326
GOOD MORNING. OH YEAH,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.578
SHE SLEEPS LIKE A LOG. YOU'D HAVE
BETTER LUCK CHOPPING HER DOWN

13:49.579 --> 13:50.950
THAN YOU WILL WAKING HER UP.

13:50.951 --> 13:53.332
OH, HONEY. CHECK THIS OUT.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.793
YOU READY?

13:54.794 --> 13:57.166
WHAT? YES, I'M BACK.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.879
THAT'S RIGHT, AND I AM READY TO
STRUT YOU DOWN THE AISLE TODAY.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.130
AW, THAT'S GREAT, JOE.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.301
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:02.302 --> 14:04.964
YEAH SURE, FINE.

14:04.965 --> 14:07.346
OH, JEEZ. OKAY.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.178
SHE TOLD YOU SOMETHING
EMBARRASSING

14:09.179 --> 14:10.769
ABOUT ME LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T SHE?

14:10.770 --> 14:13.182
WELL, UM...

14:13.183 --> 14:14.523
I DON'T WANT TO FREAK YOU OUT,

14:14.524 --> 14:18.567
BUT SHE DID SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT...

14:18.568 --> 14:19.608
MY BRIEFCASE?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.860
- THAT'S IT.
- I KNEW IT.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.193
LOOK, THAT WAS AN AWESOME
BRIEFCASE, ALL RIGHT?

14:24.194 --> 14:26.285
EVERY KID IN THAT CLASS
WANTED THAT BRIEFCASE.

14:26.286 --> 14:28.247
WHATEVER, I'M OVER IT.
I'M NOT GONNA RETALIATE.

14:28.248 --> 14:30.119
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I WILL.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.491
I THINK I'M GONNA JUST DRAW A
LITTLE MUSTACHE ON HER FACE.

14:32.492 --> 14:34.753
- JOE!
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE'S A LONGO.

14:34.754 --> 14:36.755
SHE'LL HAVE ONE FOR REAL
IN A COUPLE YEARS ANYWAY.

14:36.756 --> 14:37.997
ALL RIGHT.

14:37.998 --> 14:39.129
I'M GONNA GO GET DRESSED.

14:42.342 --> 14:43.963
HEY, I STILL HAVE
THAT BRIEFCASE.

14:43.964 --> 14:45.135
IT'S STILL AWESOME.

14:47.057 --> 14:48.137
OW! OH!

14:48.138 --> 14:49.598
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

14:49.599 --> 14:51.720
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME MORE
ABOUT JOE'S SECRET DAUGHTER.

14:51.721 --> 14:54.223
JOE HAS A SECRET DAUGHTER?

14:54.224 --> 14:56.976
FINE, PLAY IT THAT WAY. I AM
JUST GONNA SEND YOUR HUSBAND

14:56.977 --> 14:59.478
THIS PHOTO OF YOU FLASHING THE
BARTENDER FROM LAST NIGHT.

14:59.479 --> 15:00.819
WHAT? NO, YOU WOULDN'T!

15:00.820 --> 15:02.651
I AM A BRIDE ON A JUICE FAST.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.573
THERE IS NO TELLING
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

15:04.574 --> 15:06.365
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

15:06.366 --> 15:07.656
LOOK...

15:07.657 --> 15:09.788
( sighs ) THE MOM'S
NAME IS FELICIA.

15:09.789 --> 15:11.290
SHE LIVED DOWN THE
STREET FROM US.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.122
14 YEARS AGO JOE CAME HOME

15:13.123 --> 15:15.294
AND I HAD A BIG NEW
YEAR'S EVE PARTY.

15:15.295 --> 15:18.457
AND WELL, AT MIDNIGHT, THEY
DID MORE THAN JUST KISS.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.300
AFTER SHE GOT PREGNANT,
FELICIA MOVED OUT OF TOWN

15:21.301 --> 15:23.842
AND SHE HAD THE BABY. BUT
SHE SWORE ME TO SECRECY,

15:23.843 --> 15:25.714
SO YOU CAN'T TELL
JOE ANY OF THIS.

15:25.715 --> 15:28.637
I HAVE TO TELL HIM. WE ARE
ABOUT TO GET MARRIED.

15:28.638 --> 15:30.469
I KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
YOU CAN'T TELL HIM TODAY.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.182
IT'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.893
- THIS IS AWFUL!
- YEAH.

15:34.894 --> 15:37.016
YOU GONNA ERASE THAT PICTURE
OFF YOUR PHONE NOW?

15:37.017 --> 15:40.229
EH, THERE'S NO PHOTO. YOU DIDN'T
FLASH ANYBODY LAST NIGHT.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.442
HUH, REALLY? I THOUGHT
I HAD MORE FUN.

15:44.364 --> 15:46.366
( classical music playing )

15:50.991 --> 15:53.242
RYDER. SO?

15:53.243 --> 15:54.873
GRANDPA'S NOT HERE YET.

15:54.874 --> 15:56.625
- DO WE WAIT FOR HIM?
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.877
I SHOULD HAVE BET SOMEBODY 50 BUCKS
HE'D BE LATE TO THIS WEDDING.

15:58.878 --> 16:02.291
PAY UP, JOSEPH.
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

16:02.292 --> 16:04.253
WELCOME TO MY
DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.256
I'M SO PLEASED YOU
COULD ALL MAKE IT.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.428
RUSSELL, I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE.

16:09.429 --> 16:10.589
MOM.

16:10.590 --> 16:12.391
RUSSELL, THIS IS
MY MOTHER GLORIA.

16:12.392 --> 16:16.265
MOM, THIS IS MEL'S DAD,
SENATOR RUSSELL BURKE.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.857
WELL, I AM VERY
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

16:18.858 --> 16:21.150
GLAD YOU COULD SQUEEZE US IN.

16:21.151 --> 16:24.733
NOW WHEN YOU TAKE MEL
DOWN THE AISLE...

16:24.734 --> 16:26.775
NOT TOO FAST, NOT TOO SLOW.

16:26.776 --> 16:28.447
JUST STAY IN STEP
WITH THE MUSIC.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.778
IT'S NOT BRAIN SURGERY.

16:29.779 --> 16:32.321
MY GOODNESS, AREN'T YOU
A SHRINKING VIOLET?

16:32.322 --> 16:35.374
SENATOR, LET'S SAVE THE SMART
COMMENTS TILL WE'RE DONE

16:35.375 --> 16:36.875
AND JUST DO WHAT I SAY.

16:36.876 --> 16:38.878
ABSOLUTELY, PRINCESS.

16:41.121 --> 16:42.831
HEY, COME HERE.

16:42.832 --> 16:45.714
UM, LOOK, YOU REMEMBER
OUR AGREEMENT, RIGHT?

16:45.715 --> 16:47.256
- OH YEAH.
- OKAY.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.338
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

16:49.339 --> 16:52.181
AFTER THE WEDDING, YOU'RE TELLING MEL AND
JOE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.513
- YOU CAN'T KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.475
I REALLY THINK THE BEST
WAY FOR ME TO TELL THEM

16:56.476 --> 16:58.348
IS FOR YOU TO TELL THEM.

16:59.899 --> 17:02.901
- WHAT? THEY LIKE YOU BETTER.
- EVERYBODY LIKES ME BETTER.

17:02.902 --> 17:05.695
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THIS IS YOUR
PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.818
HEY, ZANDER.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.360
I'M ABOUT TO DO THE PROCESSION,

17:11.361 --> 17:14.913
HOWEVER MY PHONE CREATES
AN UNSIGHTLY BULGE

17:14.914 --> 17:16.956
AND RUINS THE SLEEK
LINE OF MY PANT.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.959
WOULD YOU BE A BUD AND
HOLD THIS FOR ME?

17:20.960 --> 17:24.754
SURE, ANYTHING TO FIX THE
UNSIGHTLY BULGE IN YOUR PANT.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.224
( wedding processional playing )

18:26.936 --> 18:30.610
FRIENDS, FAMILY, POWER
BROKERS OF TOLEDO...

18:32.992 --> 18:34.153
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

18:34.154 --> 18:35.614
TO CELEBRATE THE MARRIAGE

18:35.615 --> 18:37.826
OF MELANIE ALISON BURKE

18:37.827 --> 18:39.328
AND JOSEPH PAUL LONGO.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.119
AS WE ALL KNOW,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.623
MEL AND JOE BOTH LOVE TO
GET THE LAST WORD IN.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.876
SO THE DECISION ON WHO WOULD
READ THEIR VOWS FIRST

18:47.877 --> 18:50.840
WAS DETERMINED THIS
MORNING BY COIN TOSS.

18:52.342 --> 18:54.052
IT'S ALL YOURS, JOE.

18:54.053 --> 18:55.094
THANK YOU, JUDGE.

18:56.676 --> 18:59.017
MEL...

18:59.018 --> 19:01.180
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I
WOULD EVER MEET SOMEONE

19:01.181 --> 19:03.602
THAT I COULD SHARE
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WITH.

19:03.603 --> 19:05.264
ALL MY GOOD QUALITIES

19:05.265 --> 19:08.528
AND MY... NOT-SO-GOOD QUALITIES.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.940
BUT WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES,

19:11.941 --> 19:14.032
I REALIZE THAT...

19:14.033 --> 19:17.277
I NEVER KICKBOXED.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.578
NOPE.

19:19.579 --> 19:21.950
YOU DIDN'T HURT MY FOOT
WHEN WE WERE DANCING.

19:21.951 --> 19:23.412
I ACTUALLY HURT MY FOOT

19:23.413 --> 19:26.246
WHEN I WAS DIRT-BIKE RIDING
WITH THE FELLAS YESTERDAY.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.289
I KEPT IT A SECRET.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.880
I KNOW IT'S SMALL,

19:31.881 --> 19:35.173
BUT IT'S NOT THE WAY YOU
ENTER INTO A MARRIAGE

19:35.174 --> 19:37.756
WITH THE WOMAN YOU'RE GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH.

19:37.757 --> 19:39.638
SO HERE'S MY VOW...

19:39.639 --> 19:42.681
I PROMISE I WILL LOVE YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.804
AND I PROMISE YOU THAT
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

19:45.805 --> 19:48.978
I WILL ALWAYS BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU.

19:54.113 --> 19:56.154
MEL, YOUR TURN.

19:56.155 --> 20:00.239
WHAT CAN I SAY
THAT CAN TOP THAT?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.372
OBVIOUSLY NOTHING.

20:06.286 --> 20:07.287
MEL?

20:09.128 --> 20:11.250
RIGHT.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.422
HERE GOES.

20:23.102 --> 20:24.763
MEL?

20:24.764 --> 20:26.224
WE'RE STILL WAITING.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.646
YOUR TURN FOR THE VOWS.

20:27.647 --> 20:29.348
( stammers ) I HAD SOMETHING,

20:29.349 --> 20:32.190
UM, BUT I'M... JUST
DRAWING A BLANK.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.982
WELL, JOE SAID

20:33.983 --> 20:36.815
VERY NICE WORDS ABOUT
LOVE AND HONESTY.

20:36.816 --> 20:38.857
MAYBE YOU COULD RIFF ON THAT.

20:38.858 --> 20:42.030
RIGHT RIGHT... HONESTY.

20:42.031 --> 20:43.662
YOU KNOW...

20:43.663 --> 20:46.244
I'VE BEEN KEEPING A
SECRET FROM YOU TOO, JOE.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.786
AND HERE IT IS.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.127
SHE BOUGHT ANOTHER DRESS.

20:49.128 --> 20:51.420
THAT'S IT. GET MARRIED ALREADY.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.251
WELL, THAT IS TRUE
ABOUT THE DRESS.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.966
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE.

21:02.342 --> 21:03.842
I HAVE A SECRET DOG HOUSE?

21:03.843 --> 21:05.014
NO.

21:09.148 --> 21:10.188
A SECRET DAUGHTER?

21:10.189 --> 21:13.022
( gasping )

21:15.985 --> 21:17.566
YEP.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.399
WHEW, WELL...

21:20.400 --> 21:21.321
I FEEL GOOD NOW.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.781
ALL RIGHT, ( clears throat )

21:22.782 --> 21:24.203
I'M READY TO DO MY VOWS NOW.
