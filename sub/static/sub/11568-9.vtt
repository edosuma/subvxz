00:00.934 --> 00:02.701
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:05.605 --> 00:08.574
DAVID: Everybody thinks
the markets are rigged.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.976
The big boys on Wall Street
know something

00:10.978 --> 00:13.879
that the average Joe
on Main Street doesn't.

00:13.881 --> 00:17.750
Sure that goes on, but...
But this is something
different.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.186
This is manipulation
of the market

00:21.188 --> 00:23.088
on an unprecedented scale.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.090
On a...
On a whole other level.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.959
Next level shit. Mmm-hmm.

00:26.961 --> 00:29.194
Uh, yes, that's...
That's right.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.230
So for example,
the stock would
be available...

00:31.232 --> 00:33.432
Could you give us an example?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.267
-Yeah, that's what...
-Go on.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.503
(STAMMERS) Okay.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.773
So for example,
let's say we want to buy
a stock at $30 a share.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.609
Since our fund is pretty big,
we'd want to buy
a lot of shares.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.210
Say, 100,000 shares.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.547
Mmm. 100,000 shares of stock.

00:48.549 --> 00:52.551
Uh, yes. 100,000
shares of the same stock.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.719
MIKE: Mmm.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.488
So we place the order.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.425
Just like any other investor,
we literally click on the
button that says, "Buy."

00:59.427 --> 01:04.263
And soon as we do it,
the stock is no longer
available at $30 a share.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.532
The market would
move against us.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.401
May I borrow one of these?

01:14.040 --> 01:18.410
Now, when you place an order,
it takes about a millisecond
from why you click buy

01:18.412 --> 01:20.679
for that order
to get to the exchange.

01:20.681 --> 01:26.185
How is it
that in one millisecond
100,000 shares for sale

01:26.187 --> 01:28.454
are no longer for sale?

01:28.456 --> 01:31.757
Were they ever really there
or are they phantom shares?

01:33.293 --> 01:34.793
That's why we asked you
to come here.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.795
Because if you can answer
that question,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.931
you just might make
the market safe again,

01:38.933 --> 01:43.235
which is what will in turn
make the American economy
strong again,

01:43.237 --> 01:45.337
which will in turn
save the world.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.473
David, would you mind
if I speak privately

01:47.475 --> 01:49.842
with my colleagues
for a moment?

01:49.844 --> 01:51.143
Yeah, of course. Please.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.416
Okay, so here's the deal.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.084
I didn't understand
any of that.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.286
So I propose we get
the (BLEEP) out of here.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.588
MARQUESS: What?

02:12.465 --> 02:13.899
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

02:24.811 --> 02:26.078

02:27.748 --> 02:29.214
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

02:36.756 --> 02:38.891
We've come all the way
to New York, Michael.

02:38.893 --> 02:41.193
We're not even going to
try and solve the mystery?

02:41.195 --> 02:43.529
Nope. Too hard, too boring.
Right, Pigeon?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.198
Huh, what?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.600
Pigeon, are you listening
to music?

02:48.602 --> 02:49.701
Book on tape.

02:49.703 --> 02:54.106
Benghazi.
Man, what really went down.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.507
What's going on? Where are we?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.843
We're down on Wall Street,
but not for long.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.711
I'm calling the car service.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.114
-Maybe we can go home
on an earlier flight.
-(DIAL TONE TRILLS)

03:02.116 --> 03:04.683
(CARS HONKING)

03:04.685 --> 03:07.152
You know, Mr. Tyson,
I've driven you before.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.588
You and the...
You and the whole team.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.657
I see you're still traveling
with the little bird.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.560
You know who else travels
with animals? Helen Hunt.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.195
Drove her and her little dog.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.964
I'd love to get
between the sheets
with Helen Hunt.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.532
What a body on her.

03:21.868 --> 03:26.405
I mean, the state department.
What a mess!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.273
Hey, can I ask
what you're doing in town?

03:28.275 --> 03:30.842
Ugh. Not seeing <i> Hamilton,</i>
apparently.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.879
Oh, we were here
for a mystery,
but it wasn't a good fit.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.547
You got 45 minutes?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.216
Because if you've got
45 minutes,

03:37.218 --> 03:40.385
I'll show you the
biggest mystery you've
ever seen in your life.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.957
Okay. Can you please
look at the road?

03:52.632 --> 03:54.466
You see that house there?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.802
That ugly piece of (BLEEP)
that looks like
it has water damage?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.004
I bought it with my wife.
This is where we were
going to retire.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.974
Six months after
we close on the house,
she says she wants a divorce.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.542
She says, "I don't love you,
I never loved you.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.178
"Hit the road, Jack.
Go take a walk."

04:06.180 --> 04:07.980
-(GASPS) That's horrible!
-Aw!

04:07.982 --> 04:09.982
Eh, she was lousy
in the sack anyway.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.416
Never sucked me off. Not once.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.352
MARQUESS: Hmm.
YUNG HEE: Ugh!

04:13.354 --> 04:14.953
LIMO DRIVER:
Pardon me. I keep forgetting
there's a child back there.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.755
Sorry, I don't have
a lolly for ya.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.658
I usually keep some
hard candy upfront, but uh...

04:21.294 --> 04:22.728
-I ate them all.
-(SCOFFS)

04:22.730 --> 04:27.733
I'm sorry.
Did you say the mystery
and I missed it?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.935
So I rented out the house
to a family.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.536
Decent credit, not great.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.472
They say they don't
have a dog.
They have a dog.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.007
But you pick your battles.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.276
So now they say
that the house is unsafe.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.444
There is a phantasm
in the house.

04:39.446 --> 04:44.016
Claim the boy, nine or ten,
was taken by the phantasm
to the end of the universe.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.587
(WHISTLES) Look at the cans
on that one.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.023
YUNG HEE: Well, is that them?

04:51.025 --> 04:53.191
Get down. Everybody down.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.961
I was supposed to
get an inspection done
three months ago.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.929
There's mold everywhere.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.699
So you want us to go
to the end of the universe
and get their boy back?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.534
I just want them
to start paying rent again.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.903
I'm not going to tell you
how to do your job.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.505
If you go the end
of the universe,

05:06.507 --> 05:07.773
if you don't go
to the end of the universe.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.908
Ai-yai-yai,
look at those cans.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.744
And that caboose.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.212
Have to remember
that for later.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.314
Jack-off time.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.982
-MARQUESS: Ugh!
-Sorry.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.383
Pardon me.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.920
-More tea?
-MIKE: Thank you, ma'am.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.056
This is such a blessing
that you are here.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.225
We went to the police
and they were most unhelpful.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.094
I guess when you
say to the police

05:29.096 --> 05:33.265
that a phantasmin has taken
your son to the end
of the universe,

05:33.267 --> 05:35.200
they say you are crazy.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.835
But we are not crazy.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.938
So can you please bring back
our little Raji?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.840
(SLURPING)

05:41.842 --> 05:43.475
Would you mind
if I spoke privately

05:43.477 --> 05:45.344
with my colleagues
for a moment please?

05:45.346 --> 05:46.845
Of course.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.714
MARQUESS: First place,
math decathlon,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.349
first place, spelling bee.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.951
Ah, Raji is a child prodigy.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.220
-Okay, let's get
the (BLEEP) out of here.
-Dad!

05:55.222 --> 05:57.622
I changed my mind
I like the first mystery
better.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.358
This one has too many
moving parts.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.159
One dude want us
to get rent money,

06:01.161 --> 06:04.563
some other dude
want us to go to
the end of the universe.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.066
(THUDDING)

06:13.806 --> 06:15.707
Ah! Oh!

06:39.499 --> 06:41.600
-Yeah, no.
-(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

06:41.602 --> 06:43.802
Oh, hey!
I thought you guys left.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.637
What? I said I needed
to talk to my team.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.039
Well, it's been
about three hours.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.274
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.543
You know how long
I needed to talk to my team?

06:51.545 --> 06:55.380
You better watch that
(BLEEP) attitude,
Wall Street boy.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.116
Remind me again.
What was your mystery?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.118
So when we click
the button that says, "Buy,"

07:00.120 --> 07:03.054
the stock is no longer
available at $30 a share.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.791
When you place an order,
it takes about a millisecond
from when...

07:05.793 --> 07:08.160
MIKE: <i> Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I was right the first time.</i>

07:08.162 --> 07:11.763
<i>We should have gone</i>
<i>to the end of the universe</i>
<i>to save that little boy.</i>

07:11.765 --> 07:14.132
<i>That was the clear,</i>
<i>obvious one to choose.</i>

07:14.134 --> 07:16.668
<i>It had all the elements</i>
<i>of a good mystery</i>

07:16.670 --> 07:19.171
<i>that my audience</i>
<i>has come to expect.</i>

07:19.173 --> 07:22.641
<i>This shit? This is how</i>
<i>shows get canceled.</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:24.843
So, what is happening?
Are they phantom shares?

07:24.845 --> 07:29.381
Would you mind
if we go outside to discuss
one aspect of this mystery?

07:29.383 --> 07:30.882
Oh, my God!

07:36.088 --> 07:38.423
Where the (BLEEP)
are the stairs, man?

07:38.425 --> 07:40.759
PHANTASM: Buy it. Buy it now!

07:40.761 --> 07:43.662
It's done.
Now may I go home,
phantasm?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.731
So it's all there?
$35 million?

07:48.100 --> 07:52.170
Then, yes, Raji,
I have no more use for you.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.439
-Where's my cut?
-What cut?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.475
10%. To help you.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.344
You said I could have 10%
if I give you the algorithm.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.813
(BLEEP) you! 10%!

08:01.815 --> 08:04.049
I'm going
to the end of the universe.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.750
But I need the money
for my family.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.619
The house is covered in mold.

08:12.358 --> 08:16.228
So it was your algorithm
that cheated the market
out of billions of dollars.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.963
Not some phantom orders?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.097
No, it was both.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.399
Except they were
not phantom orders,

08:21.401 --> 08:24.135
they were phantasm orders.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.138
Hey, what's the difference
between a phantom
and a phantasm?

08:27.140 --> 08:31.843
(SCOFFS) Oh, of course.
Ask the only ghost
in the room. (CHUCKLES)

08:31.845 --> 08:34.179
While we're at it,
why don't we just ask David

08:34.181 --> 08:37.516
the difference between
a Hasidic Jew
and an Orthodox Jew?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.117
(LAUGHS)

08:39.119 --> 08:42.587
-Oh, I'm... I'm not Jewish.
-Hmm? Oh! (HIGH-PITCHED) Oh!

08:42.589 --> 08:44.322
(NORMAL VOICE)
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.925
I just... I assumed, you know?

08:46.927 --> 08:51.162
Working on Wall Street,
curly dark hair,
prominent nose,

08:51.164 --> 08:54.633
abrupt manner and...
I'm sorry, am I still talking?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.137
Raji! What were
you saying, dear?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.906
The phantasm said
he needed the money

09:00.908 --> 09:02.274
because the
end of the universe

09:02.276 --> 09:05.143
is the most beautiful place
in existence.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.446
And the real estate
market there
is incredibly tight.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.282
He kept saying
how tight it was.

09:10.284 --> 09:14.019
He said he would need
many, many millions
even to get a dump.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.755
But he's going to be
very angry when he determines

09:16.757 --> 09:19.658
that all the stock purchases
he made were in my name.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.728
You see, I knew that
I was possibly dealing
with a very bad man,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.864
owing to the fact
that he was a phantasm.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.899
And that he was very angry
all the time.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.501
And that he would kidnap
a young boy.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.269
I knew it!

09:31.271 --> 09:33.638
I (BLEEP) knew it.
I didn't need to hear
any of this shit.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.607
Oh, please!

09:35.609 --> 09:39.311
Easy to say that after
this little boy just explained
the entire thing.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.480
I mean, the whole thing
is such bull-(BLEEP).

09:42.482 --> 09:44.282
Cover up, no cover up.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.519
It's just the shit
that goes with being
the world's policemen.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.521
You know what I mean?

09:49.523 --> 09:51.389
(SIGHS) Hey, wait a second.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.192
We are back here again?
Weren't we in some
Indian restaurant?

09:54.194 --> 09:57.195
I remember smelling
a bunch of curry and mildew.
I'm...

09:57.197 --> 10:00.165
I'm hungry as hell.
Have we eaten yet or...

10:00.167 --> 10:02.167
PHANTASM: What do you mean
there's a problem?

10:02.169 --> 10:05.170
Insufficient funds?
That's impossible.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.206
I'll call the bank
and straighten everything out.

10:08.208 --> 10:12.243
There's a higher offer?
It's been accepted?
Who made it?

10:17.183 --> 10:18.617
Excuse me, sir.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.019
Could you please
remove yourself
from our property?

10:21.021 --> 10:23.822
What? Where am I to live?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.691
It's $1,900 a month.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.593
Rent's due by the 3rd,
otherwise it goes up.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.830
And I keep making it
go up and up and up
until you pay.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.798
No dogs.
