01:00.662 --> 01:02.998
[yells] Breakfast, everybody!

01:05.084 --> 01:05.918
Hey, girls!

01:06.001 --> 01:07.002
Hi!

01:12.215 --> 01:14.426
How'd you sleep
in Nicky and Alex's old room?

01:14.634 --> 01:16.929
Great, until Kimmy got in bed with me.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.307
I should have told you
I sleepwalk and sleep-cuddle.

01:23.102 --> 01:25.395
You also sleep-snore and sleep-drool.

01:26.521 --> 01:27.397
It's true.

01:28.023 --> 01:28.982
This is so great.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.818
We saw Dad before
the <i>Wake Up, San Francisco</i> reunion,

01:31.902 --> 01:33.070
and now we see you after.

01:33.278 --> 01:36.823
Well, Jesse's been so busy
with his new job in LA.

01:36.907 --> 01:39.785
And I really miss
hanging out with you guys.

01:40.660 --> 01:44.289
[coos] Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

01:45.999 --> 01:48.543
Uh... Becky, we're over here.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.881
[coos] Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

01:54.174 --> 01:57.510
Guys! Guys! You've gotta see
what's in the living room!

01:57.719 --> 02:01.056
It's incredible, it's amazing, it's...

02:03.391 --> 02:04.977
I'm out of adjectives.

02:06.770 --> 02:07.980
Come on, you guys.

02:09.481 --> 02:11.775
It's unbelievable!

02:11.858 --> 02:13.610
Oh, I had one more.

02:18.824 --> 02:19.950
[gasps]

02:20.033 --> 02:22.327
- Oh...
- My...

02:22.410 --> 02:23.536
Lanta!

02:25.831 --> 02:28.000
The whole house smells like potpourri.

02:29.709 --> 02:31.837
- Who are these for?
- I don't know.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.589
I just let the delivery guy in
and signed my mom's name.

02:34.798 --> 02:36.133
Wha... You signed my name?

02:36.341 --> 02:38.343
Yeah, I'm getting really good at it.

02:39.970 --> 02:42.055
Oh, thanks for getting me
out of gym class.

02:42.973 --> 02:44.016
Gotta go.

02:45.558 --> 02:46.852
Where's the card?

02:48.687 --> 02:50.230
I don't see one.

02:52.941 --> 02:55.861
Ooh, someone has a secret admirer.

02:56.069 --> 02:57.029
It's no secret.

02:57.112 --> 02:59.072
They must be from Fernando.

02:59.156 --> 03:02.201
Oh, he's trying so hard to put
our marriage back together.

03:02.283 --> 03:05.829
Last week he even got
a tattoo of me on his left butt cheek.

03:07.831 --> 03:09.916
These roses are obviously for me.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.044
I just have to figure out
who they're from.

03:12.252 --> 03:14.004
It could be Darren from the coffee shop,

03:14.087 --> 03:16.923
Val from Club Euphoria,
or this baseball player I'm seeing.

03:17.132 --> 03:20.343
Oh, please. Do any of them
have your face on their butt?

03:21.928 --> 03:23.388
That's none of your business.

03:24.848 --> 03:26.641
What about D.J. and the hot doggie doc?

03:26.850 --> 03:29.895
Matt? Oh, we only kissed once.

03:30.103 --> 03:32.647
I mean, that would be
way too much, way too soon.

03:32.856 --> 03:35.067
Yeah. It's like a thousand roses in here.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.527
I mean, you'd have to be
one heck of a kisser.

03:38.862 --> 03:42.782
Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn,
but toot-toot.

03:45.244 --> 03:47.954
What about Steve? He's been
crazy about you since high school.

03:48.163 --> 03:52.000
Oh, that's true. And he never really
has gotten over me.

03:52.084 --> 03:55.378
No, it's not Steve.
He would've sent a roomful of hams.

03:58.006 --> 04:01.676
This is like
a cheesy romance novel come to life.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.596
Who's the mystery man?
Is it Kimmy's Latin lover?

04:04.804 --> 04:07.473
One of Stephanie's
three hot-blooded boy-toys?

04:07.682 --> 04:11.436
Is it Matt, the kissing veterinarian,
or Steve, the lovesick podiatrist?

04:11.519 --> 04:12.896
Oh, it's ringing.

04:12.979 --> 04:13.939
I'm calling Steve.

04:14.147 --> 04:15.565
What? Oh, no, no, Becky, I...

04:15.648 --> 04:17.192
Hi. Hi, Steve.

04:18.026 --> 04:20.028
It's D.J. on Becky's phone.

04:20.237 --> 04:22.572
Oh, my God,
is Becky having another corn crisis?

04:22.655 --> 04:25.200
Listen, just drive her over here, OK?

04:25.284 --> 04:28.245
I will squeeze her in
before my ten o'clock hammer toe.

04:29.412 --> 04:32.415
No, no, no, she's fine.
Just a quick question.

04:32.498 --> 04:34.876
Did you send me an insane amount of roses?

04:35.085 --> 04:35.919
No.

04:36.586 --> 04:39.631
Does that mean somebody else
sent you an insane amount of roses?

04:39.714 --> 04:43.802
No. If they're not from you, then they're
probably for Stephanie or Kimmy.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.095
Oh, OK.

04:45.178 --> 04:47.097
Well, look, just tell everybody I said hi

04:47.180 --> 04:50.892
and, to avoid foot fungus,
always wear flip-flops in the shower.

04:51.601 --> 04:52.978
Bye, Steve.

04:53.603 --> 04:54.687
It's not Steve.

04:54.771 --> 04:56.231
Oh, he said to remind you to...

04:56.439 --> 04:58.775
[all] Always wear flip-flops
in the shower.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.779
I'm not leaving
till I get to the bottom of this.

05:02.862 --> 05:05.531
Jesse and I don't have
this kind of excitement anymore.

05:05.615 --> 05:06.950
After 28 years of marriage,

05:07.033 --> 05:09.869
the only mystery is
who's gonna unload the dishwasher.

05:11.371 --> 05:14.582
[coos] And it's not a mystery
because it's always me.

05:15.708 --> 05:18.920
Yes, it is. It's always me.

05:19.671 --> 05:20.964
Oh, yes, it is.

05:21.047 --> 05:23.258
OK, Aunt Becky, time for a baby break.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.302
- No, he doesn't want to...
- Yeah, he does.

05:25.510 --> 05:28.013
Little break,
little, little break, Aunt Becky.

05:34.519 --> 05:36.104
- Hey, Lola.
- Hey, dude.

05:37.356 --> 05:38.690
I'll be right there.

05:40.066 --> 05:43.695
Look, I know you like Lola,
but the worst thing just happened.

05:43.903 --> 05:45.446
Ooh, more drama.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.411
- What?
- She called you "dude," dude.

05:52.537 --> 05:53.372
So?

05:53.579 --> 05:57.250
"Dude" means you've entered...
the dreaded friend zone.

05:59.294 --> 06:00.170
It's true.

06:00.253 --> 06:03.506
"Bud," "pal," "dude"... even "amigo."

06:04.549 --> 06:06.301
She amigo-ed me yesterday!

06:07.427 --> 06:08.428
What do I do?

06:08.636 --> 06:11.848
Once you're in the friend zone,
you can never get out.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.934
It's like Alcatraz.

06:17.187 --> 06:18.479
Or IKEA.

06:20.982 --> 06:22.608
You can get out.

06:22.692 --> 06:24.861
Just show her
you wanna be more than friends.

06:24.944 --> 06:27.197
Girls love it when guys
do something romantic.

06:27.406 --> 06:30.325
- Ah, like all those roses in there?
- Exactly.

06:30.409 --> 06:32.994
- What does Lola like?
- Ooh! She wants her own horse.

06:33.078 --> 06:34.120
Oh, boy!

06:35.496 --> 06:37.165
- What else does she like?
- M&Ms.

06:37.374 --> 06:40.043
Now we're talking.
I'll get her 1,000 M&Ms.

06:40.252 --> 06:41.586
But only the red ones.

06:41.794 --> 06:43.629
But they all taste the same.

06:43.713 --> 06:46.758
Hey, Friend Zone. You wanna be right,
or you wanna be happy?

06:52.555 --> 06:54.807
You've got your new license.

06:55.016 --> 06:57.310
Now you're a legal beagle.

06:59.938 --> 07:03.108
Two coffees, and one water, no ice.

07:04.317 --> 07:07.195
I thank you. And Fred thanks you.

07:08.154 --> 07:10.823
We really need to talk
about this elephant in the room.

07:11.032 --> 07:13.243
Don't tell me
there's an elephant out there.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.871
No, I'm talking about
our little make-out session.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.207
Oh, that elephant in the room.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.834
OK, I'm just going to say it.

07:22.794 --> 07:26.423
I like you, D.J.,
and I hope that you like me,

07:27.048 --> 07:28.508
and I wanna go on a date.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.970
But if you don't, I am happy
to keep things entirely professional

07:32.053 --> 07:33.805
and super awkward.

07:35.765 --> 07:39.018
Matt, you're an amazing guy,
but we do work together.

07:39.227 --> 07:40.937
OK, bad start.

07:41.146 --> 07:42.272
But I do really like you.

07:42.481 --> 07:43.815
Back in the game.

07:45.317 --> 07:50.238
So, I mean, I guess there's no harm
in going on one little, innocent date.

07:50.447 --> 07:51.823
Booyah.

07:52.907 --> 07:53.992
How's dinner tonight?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.952
- I'm completely free.
- Great.

07:56.536 --> 07:59.872
I was a little worried when you didn't
mention the flowers that I got you.

08:01.541 --> 08:03.209
Those were from you?

08:03.418 --> 08:05.211
Yeah, it was just a little gesture.

08:06.338 --> 08:08.340
A little gesture?

08:09.048 --> 08:11.343
That was nothing.
Wait till we go on a real date.

08:13.345 --> 08:17.390
Oh, my gosh.
Ooh, I think I just lost a filling.

08:19.017 --> 08:21.520
- Like just this second?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:22.061 --> 08:24.063
Yeah, I have to go to the dentist.

08:24.147 --> 08:27.066
But he's all booked right now, so,

08:27.150 --> 08:28.943
I'm going to have to go tonight.

08:29.902 --> 08:31.363
You have a night dentist?

08:32.489 --> 08:34.282
Yeah, it's a real thing. Look it up.

08:36.701 --> 08:39.078
But no dinner. I mean, that's the point.

08:43.207 --> 08:44.625
997,

08:44.834 --> 08:46.461
998,

08:46.545 --> 08:48.046
999...

08:49.214 --> 08:52.008
[groans] I'm one red one short.

08:52.091 --> 08:53.552
- [sighs]
- [barks]

08:53.634 --> 08:55.636
Oh, I'll hide a red Skittle.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.263
She'll never know.

08:58.515 --> 09:00.808
So you didn't send me roses either.

09:01.393 --> 09:05.897
No, by "either," I didn't mean to imply
that I was dating more than one guy...

09:07.482 --> 09:08.316
Darren.

09:11.069 --> 09:12.404
OK, alright, bye.

09:13.112 --> 09:15.156
Aw, Steph, I'm so sorry.

09:15.365 --> 09:18.993
I heard Mr. Coffee, Mr. Night Club, and
Mr. Baseball didn't send you the roses.

09:19.202 --> 09:21.954
- Who'd you hear that from?
- Me. I was listening at the door.

09:24.082 --> 09:26.834
Sometimes I wonder
if I'll ever find a real relationship.

09:26.918 --> 09:28.211
[cell phone pings]

09:28.294 --> 09:29.588
Hang on, that's my husband.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.758
I'm sorry, your what?

09:33.966 --> 09:35.760
My husband, Harry Takayama.

09:36.886 --> 09:39.347
It was a beautiful ceremony...

09:39.431 --> 09:42.141
[playing "Wedding March" on kazoos]

09:57.782 --> 10:01.702
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

10:01.786 --> 10:06.541
to join Stephanie and Harry
in holy mattress money.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.503
Now say "I do."

10:10.753 --> 10:11.796
I do.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.298
I do, too.

10:14.132 --> 10:19.304
Stephanie and Harry,
I now announce you man and wife.

10:19.387 --> 10:21.097
You may kiss the bride.

10:22.014 --> 10:25.518
- Eww!
- Eww!

10:25.726 --> 10:28.605
If you don't kiss,
you're not really married.

10:37.656 --> 10:39.365
He's not a bad kisser.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.954
I remember that wedding.
You were registered at Toys "R" Us.

10:46.372 --> 10:47.957
Yeah. We did rush into things.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.502
We should've waited
till we were at least seven.

10:51.043 --> 10:51.919
His text says,

10:52.128 --> 10:55.298
"After what I sent you, I thought I
would've heard back from you by now."

10:55.507 --> 10:57.758
Ooh, maybe Harry sent the roses.

10:57.842 --> 10:59.594
Yeah, I'll bet he did!

10:59.678 --> 11:03.598
Every few years, Harry does something
crazy to try and start dating me,

11:03.806 --> 11:05.183
but I've never given him a shot.

11:05.391 --> 11:06.559
Maybe you should.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.312
I'm not getting anywhere
with these bad boys,

11:09.395 --> 11:10.647
and Harry's got a great job,

11:10.730 --> 11:14.984
he's dependable,
reliable, always on time.

11:17.111 --> 11:21.407
And what girl doesn't want a man
who's tall, dark and... punctual?

11:22.742 --> 11:24.410
Every girl's dream.

11:25.662 --> 11:27.497
You know what?
He was a lot of fun in bed.

11:27.706 --> 11:28.831
What?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.919
What? We used to love jumping
back and forth on the beds together.

11:39.884 --> 11:42.512
You know, I want someone to send me roses.

11:42.595 --> 11:45.139
I want me some Harry Takayama.

11:46.182 --> 11:48.768
I am inviting him over here right now.

11:48.851 --> 11:50.729
Ooh, this is getting juicy.

11:51.854 --> 11:53.565
You are enjoying this too much.

11:53.732 --> 11:55.274
Ah, yes, I am!

12:02.198 --> 12:04.492
Holy chalupas!

12:07.286 --> 12:08.621
"I really like you."

12:09.622 --> 12:11.457
"Wanna hang out with me Saturday?"

12:12.542 --> 12:15.670
M&Ms and a whole day with Jackson?

12:15.754 --> 12:17.338
Heck, yeah!

12:19.882 --> 12:23.219
Sugar rush, here I come!

12:25.680 --> 12:27.306
[doorbell rings]

12:30.184 --> 12:31.519
<i>Hola</i>, Kimberlina.

12:40.486 --> 12:42.863
I like the way you say "hello."

12:44.574 --> 12:47.410
Thank you so much for the beautiful roses.

12:48.453 --> 12:50.663
These beautiful roses?

12:51.706 --> 12:54.667
Oh, the note got lost,
but I know they're from you.

12:54.751 --> 12:56.461
You big hunk of romance.

13:00.799 --> 13:03.134
- You sure there's no note?
- Mm-mm.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.637
In that case, you're very welcome.

13:09.599 --> 13:12.727
[Max chuckles]

13:13.311 --> 13:15.104
Did you see us kissing again?

13:15.187 --> 13:17.064
[Max] I sure did.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.734
You're not gonna tell Ramona, right?

13:19.818 --> 13:21.944
[Max] I sure won't.

13:23.028 --> 13:25.114
Why are you crazier than usual?

13:25.197 --> 13:30.495
[Max] I ate 999 M&Ms and one Skittle.

13:32.580 --> 13:36.501
I race cars for a living,
but that kid makes me nervous.

13:38.837 --> 13:40.505
Aunt Becky, do you have a minute?

13:40.588 --> 13:43.591
Hold that thought.
The baby fashion show is about to begin.

13:43.675 --> 13:46.845
I call it,
"A Day in the Life of Tommy Fuller."

13:48.346 --> 13:50.890
We start our day in play-date casual.

13:54.894 --> 13:58.648
Then this little Viking is off to the
playground to conquer new sandboxes.

14:02.026 --> 14:03.569
[high-pitched horn drones]

14:04.779 --> 14:07.281
What's that? The call of the sea?

14:07.365 --> 14:10.242
It's a trip to the marina
to see the tall ships.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.793
[Tommy burbles]

14:20.044 --> 14:24.173
We end our day with a little culture
and an evening at the opera.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.518
And then it's time for a night cap.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.564
And off to bed.

14:39.772 --> 14:41.190
Right? Off to bed!

14:41.440 --> 14:43.192
[Becky makes whooshing sound]

14:45.361 --> 14:46.696
You need a dog or something.

14:47.780 --> 14:48.865
Can we talk now?

14:49.073 --> 14:52.117
Sure. Oh, wait! I forgot to show you
his astronaut outfit.

14:53.619 --> 14:56.831
It turns out Matt sent the roses.

14:57.582 --> 14:58.499
Are you sure?

14:58.708 --> 15:02.712
Because according to my notes,
there are a lot of suspects still in play.

15:02.921 --> 15:06.298
Oh no, they're definitely from Matt.
He's a weirdo, right?

15:06.507 --> 15:07.592
Of course he is.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.053
Why did I get involved
with somebody I work with?

15:11.136 --> 15:13.389
Because he's so cute.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.642
And sexy, good point.

15:17.977 --> 15:21.397
But now it turns out
he's a cute, sexy psycho.

15:22.857 --> 15:25.818
But maybe he just really, really likes me.

15:25.902 --> 15:28.905
I mean, who could blame him?
I am the total package.

15:29.822 --> 15:35.119
Let's face it, he has fallen
madly in love with me way too fast,

15:35.202 --> 15:37.956
and now I have to break his hunky heart.

15:38.706 --> 15:42.376
Thanks, Aunt Becky.
You always give such great advice.

15:42.877 --> 15:44.796
[Becky] No, wait. We're not done here.

15:45.004 --> 15:50.342
It's time for Tommy's first spacewalk.
Yes, it is.

15:50.551 --> 15:54.472
[coos] Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

15:56.849 --> 15:58.810
You know you have a baby problem, right?

15:59.477 --> 16:03.397
[coos] Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.071
Lola checked yes? Oh, thank you!

16:16.535 --> 16:18.830
OK, Saturday, we're gonna go to Sephora,

16:18.913 --> 16:22.124
pretend we wanna buy lip-gloss
and get makeovers for free.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.670
And then we'll go to Yogurtland,

16:25.753 --> 16:29.632
pretend we don't know what we want
and sample all of the flavors.

16:32.343 --> 16:33.678
Hey, Boo.

16:36.305 --> 16:37.974
Boo who?

16:39.767 --> 16:43.062
Don't be sad, girl. J-Money in the house.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.649
So, Lo-Lo, lookin' forward to Saturday?

16:46.858 --> 16:48.943
Yeah, we were just talking about it.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.820
Oh, I bet you were.

16:52.363 --> 16:55.157
Gonna be off the chain, bay!

16:56.534 --> 16:57.785
I can't wait.

16:58.536 --> 17:02.414
You can't wait to go to Sephora
and try on make-up?

17:02.623 --> 17:06.377
What are you talkin' about? Lola and I are
goin' to the Outback for a Bloomin' Onion.

17:08.503 --> 17:10.756
Jackson, there you are!

17:10.964 --> 17:13.050
I can't wait for Saturday!

17:16.095 --> 17:18.056
J-Money say what?

17:19.057 --> 17:20.391
I got your note.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.685
[shrieks] You're the best brother ever!

17:26.605 --> 17:30.068
Um, excuse me. There's been
a small misunderstanding.

17:37.116 --> 17:39.451
Max! That note was not for you.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.788
It was for Lola.
And so were the thousand red M&Ms.

17:43.915 --> 17:46.000
How did you know I loved the red ones?

17:46.084 --> 17:48.293
Oh. Everyone knows they're the best!

17:49.336 --> 17:50.713
Plus I told him.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.717
So do you wanna hang out Saturday?

17:55.342 --> 17:56.427
Sure.

17:56.635 --> 17:57.762
Hold it!

17:58.429 --> 18:00.180
We have plans Saturday.

18:00.264 --> 18:03.559
Max, I told you that note wasn't for you.

18:04.143 --> 18:05.644
That changes nothing.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.396
We have a signed contract.

18:10.108 --> 18:11.067
It's OK.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.234
Max can come, too.

18:12.317 --> 18:14.112
Saturday's a group hang at the mall.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.697
Yeah, me, Lola
and twelve of our best friends.

18:18.282 --> 18:23.328
So, I'm gonna go to the mall with Max,
Ramona and twelve other people?

18:23.495 --> 18:25.623
- Right.
- But you'll be there, too?

18:25.790 --> 18:26.791
- Yeah.
- Sweet!

18:31.796 --> 18:32.838
Hey, that's my shoe!

18:40.096 --> 18:41.597
Cosmo's a hoarder.

18:43.307 --> 18:45.267
Hey, that's my One Direction pillow.

18:45.476 --> 18:47.686
I mean, no, it's not.

18:49.188 --> 18:51.523
But, um, I know who to return it to.

18:57.279 --> 19:01.200
Wow, I just can't believe it.
I'm going out with Lola.

19:01.784 --> 19:03.410
Big deal. So am I.

19:07.206 --> 19:08.373
[clears throat]

19:09.208 --> 19:11.794
Well, well, well, Mrs. Takayama.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.798
Looking very prim and proper.

19:16.007 --> 19:19.635
Well, I figure Harry's a businessman
and I wanna show him I mean business.

19:19.844 --> 19:21.220
Oh, you have a tag back there.

19:21.303 --> 19:23.055
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't pull on that.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.100
In case this doesn't work out,
I gotta return this puppy.

19:26.308 --> 19:27.351
Tuck it in.

19:27.559 --> 19:29.187
Hey, Deej.

19:29.854 --> 19:32.481
So, you'll never guess who sent the roses.

19:32.690 --> 19:33.983
- Matt.
- Fernando.

19:34.192 --> 19:35.484
My husband Harry.

19:37.945 --> 19:39.864
Ooh, we have three suspects again.

19:40.823 --> 19:41.699
[doorbell rings]

19:41.782 --> 19:43.408
- No, no...
- No, it was Harry...

19:46.996 --> 19:48.497
Suspect number one,

19:49.498 --> 19:51.250
the Latin lover.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.919
First, Kimmy and I
get back together again,

19:54.003 --> 19:57.297
and then I find a great parking spot.

19:59.008 --> 20:02.136
Everything is coming up Fernando today.

20:06.265 --> 20:10.435
Perfect timing. Suspect number two,
the kissing veterinarian.

20:11.979 --> 20:13.689
D.J., can we talk?

20:14.773 --> 20:19.153
So there are only twelve night dentists
in the whole Bay Area,

20:19.695 --> 20:21.655
and you weren't at any of them.

20:22.823 --> 20:23.908
Because I checked.

20:26.911 --> 20:30.081
Our final suspect, the child groom.

20:33.251 --> 20:35.753
- Stephanie!
- Harry!

20:39.715 --> 20:41.259
Still a good kisser.

20:42.093 --> 20:44.511
You look like a million bucks.

20:44.595 --> 20:48.933
And in today's uncertain financial times,
that's saying a lot.

20:50.142 --> 20:52.811
Hi, everyone. Harry Takayama, CPA.

20:53.687 --> 20:57.024
OK, people, I have a flight to catch.
Let's get to the bottom of this.

20:57.108 --> 20:58.943
You three gentlemen, sit.

21:02.113 --> 21:04.115
[chattering]

21:07.118 --> 21:12.998
Dr. Matt Harmon, did you or did you not
give flowers to D.J. Fuller?

21:13.207 --> 21:16.501
- I did.
- See, I told you he sent me the roses!

21:16.668 --> 21:18.087
Oh, I didn't send these.

21:19.504 --> 21:22.967
- Wait, you just said...
- Hold on. I'm running this show.

21:24.218 --> 21:26.971
That brings us to Harry Takayama, CPA.

21:27.179 --> 21:28.555
If that is your real job.

21:30.641 --> 21:32.935
Who would lie about being a CPA?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.396
I'll ask the questions.

21:36.480 --> 21:41.193
Harry, did you or did you not
send these flowers to Stephanie?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.569
I did not.

21:42.778 --> 21:44.322
That was so sweet of...

21:44.404 --> 21:45.990
Wait, you did not?

21:48.326 --> 21:50.452
That means Fernando sent the roses.

21:50.661 --> 21:52.871
It appears once again that I did.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.209
If anyone's missing anything,

21:57.417 --> 22:00.254
Cosmo has been hiding stuff under my bed.

22:03.132 --> 22:04.175
[Cosmo barks]

22:05.592 --> 22:06.969
That means he's sorry.

22:07.136 --> 22:08.512
[Cosmo barks twice]

22:08.720 --> 22:10.055
That means he's really sorry.

22:10.764 --> 22:11.807
[Cosmo barks twice]

22:12.016 --> 22:15.186
OK, stop apologizing,
you're embarrassing yourself.

22:18.856 --> 22:22.567
Hey, here's the note for the roses.

22:22.651 --> 22:25.445
Oops. I better go feed the meter.

22:26.155 --> 22:28.949
Oh, but the sender's name is chewed off.

22:29.158 --> 22:31.285
Oh, it's after seven. I'm good.

22:32.911 --> 22:34.496
Let me see that.

22:34.705 --> 22:37.708
The florist's name is right here.
I can call the store.

22:38.709 --> 22:40.794
This is too stressful!

22:42.380 --> 22:43.964
I didn't send the roses!

22:46.300 --> 22:47.509
Why did you lie to me?

22:48.635 --> 22:52.181
Because I'm so glad
we're getting along so good.

22:54.433 --> 22:56.143
Please forgive me.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.147
We'll talk about it tonight.

23:01.232 --> 23:04.193
And if you're lucky,
we'll talk about it in the morning, too.

23:07.112 --> 23:11.867
OK, if you didn't send the roses,
then why did you say you got me flowers?

23:12.076 --> 23:13.911
[chuckles] Because I did.

23:13.994 --> 23:16.830
The two sunflowers
I left at the front desk.

23:17.039 --> 23:20.834
I mean, I would've gotten you more,
but I didn't wanna scare you.

23:23.503 --> 23:27.091
Well, in that case,
is it too late to reschedule our date?

23:27.299 --> 23:29.468
I would like that a lot.

23:30.969 --> 23:33.264
Or a little. Whichever's less scary.

23:36.392 --> 23:39.770
So what was that text about?

23:39.978 --> 23:42.273
I wanted you to RSVP to my wedding.

23:43.023 --> 23:47.319
This one's for real.
No "holy mattress money."

23:49.071 --> 23:51.323
I never even got your invitation...

23:52.116 --> 23:56.120
Oh, which is right here.
I'll be there.

23:57.871 --> 24:01.541
Before I get married, there's something
I really need to ask you.

24:02.751 --> 24:04.711
Do you want the chicken or the fish?

24:05.587 --> 24:07.631
We still haven't found
the secret admirer.

24:07.839 --> 24:08.840
Hey, now.

24:14.930 --> 24:16.223
I see you got my roses.

24:16.432 --> 24:18.100
- These are from you?
- [Jesse] Yeah.

24:18.309 --> 24:20.852
You'd think I would have got
a thank you call

24:21.061 --> 24:23.105
or a text or thumbs up emoji or something.

24:25.441 --> 24:28.902
Honey, they're beautiful.
I love them. But what are they for?

24:29.111 --> 24:32.239
As a thank you for getting
to wake up next to you every morning

24:32.323 --> 24:34.241
and fall in love with you all over again.

24:37.702 --> 24:39.497
And for that, for the good kissing.

24:41.039 --> 24:42.666
Hey, Harry! Hey, kid.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.751
You remember little Harry?

24:44.960 --> 24:45.919
He's my CPA.

24:47.879 --> 24:50.048
Let's find a way
to write these flowers off.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.634
Come on, time to whisk you away.

24:52.717 --> 24:54.553
To Hawaii on a private plane?

24:54.761 --> 24:56.305
No, to San Jose in a rental car.

24:57.639 --> 25:01.435
- [Becky] Bye, girls.
- [girls] Bye, Becky. Love you.

25:01.519 --> 25:03.145
Bye, Uncle Jesse.

25:03.228 --> 25:06.023
I hope the seats fold down on that rental.

25:06.106 --> 25:08.066
Have mercy!

25:10.152 --> 25:12.821
Not for us. I wanna get
all these flowers in the car.

25:12.904 --> 25:14.865
Ugh, I should have rented a bus.

25:16.492 --> 25:19.161
- Everyone, grab a bouquet.
- Grab a bouquet.

25:22.873 --> 25:27.169
Well, here's to three beautiful women,
none of whom got roses.

25:31.256 --> 25:33.592
I bet I'll get some roses tomorrow.

25:37.179 --> 25:41.141
Not only did I not get flowers,
my husband's marrying another woman.

25:43.394 --> 25:46.355
It's just been so long
since I've been in love for real.

25:46.438 --> 25:47.523
I kinda miss it.

25:48.524 --> 25:50.401
[sighs] Me, too.

25:52.861 --> 25:54.363
Hey, are you OK?

25:55.989 --> 25:57.616
Yeah, it's, um...

25:59.535 --> 26:02.829
It's hitting me that I'm about to go
on my first date since Tommy died.

26:10.462 --> 26:12.839
But I know he'd want me to be happy.

26:13.965 --> 26:16.093
Thank you, guys. I love you.

26:16.176 --> 26:19.137
- Love you, too.
- I'm so glad that you're here for me.

26:20.013 --> 26:23.683
Yeah... together we can
get through anything.

26:25.060 --> 26:25.894
Oh.

26:25.977 --> 26:28.647
Don't tell Becky, but I kept a few.

26:31.983 --> 26:33.360
Me, too.

26:35.446 --> 26:36.780
She'll never miss 'em.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.115
