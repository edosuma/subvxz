WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.995
(birds chirping)

02:01.789 --> 02:04.747
(theme music playing )

02:43.706 --> 02:45.697
( revs motor )

02:49.503 --> 02:52.540
Reg: Sorry I'm late.
The power's out again.

02:54.175 --> 02:58.168
How is it that you called
this extremely early morning meeting,

02:58.346 --> 03:01.338
yet I'm the one
bringing breakfast?

03:03.059 --> 03:04.765
'Cause you're a good guy.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.972
The evidence seems to go
in that direction.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.432
What's up?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.980
Can we start meeting
in the mornings?

03:15.154 --> 03:19.648
So I can bring you steel-cut oatmeal
and ask you why we're meeting?

03:19.825 --> 03:22.487
So you can teach me
how to build things.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.867
You want to be an architect?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.906
I want to make sure
those walls stay up.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.376
Do you think they could fall?

03:34.006 --> 03:37.498
I think they could
get knocked in.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.338
Could be years from now,
could be when I'm your age.

03:40.513 --> 03:41.502
( chuckles )

03:41.680 --> 03:44.217
I'll still be around
when you're my age.

03:44.392 --> 03:48.385
Well, it wouldn't hurt if I knew
some of what you knew.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.145
For the walls, the houses.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.229
Some new buildings.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.608
So you're in it
for the long haul?

04:02.368 --> 04:03.949
Yeah.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.172
What are you writing?

04:19.343 --> 04:22.460
Oh, lwrite everything down.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.549
Everything of note.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.772
Now you should.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.285
There's gonna be
a lot to remember.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.788
This is the beginning
of this place.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.332
You should record all that.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.879
Along with everything
I'm gonna teach you

04:59.049 --> 05:00.755
about building things.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.332
( turns off water)

05:36.462 --> 05:38.418
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Nicholas: Just take it.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.877
- Come on, you got to protect yourself.
- Not if I don't go.

05:42.051 --> 05:45.839
We're not driving all that way so we can
just drive back with the wrong shit.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.002
It's a dozen of these.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.014
They are consistent in appearance
across manufacturers.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.266
Okay?
The shit will be right.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.348
I will install said shit.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.764
Then the grid will be
fully operational again.

06:04.657 --> 06:07.490
Heard you talking to Holly last night.
What's her story?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.321
Why do you ask?

06:09.495 --> 06:11.861
- No reason.
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.496
It's an innocent question.
Don't make me hurt you.

06:14.667 --> 06:15.873
Reg:
You got everything?

06:16.043 --> 06:18.204
First aid kits, yellow pages.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.869
Glenn made a checklist.
We're good, I swear.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.708
I know.
I'm just a worrier.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.215
That's how that wall
wound up around us.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.377
Love you.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.045
Take care, Dad.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.339
I'm supposed to be
saying that to you.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.554
That's everything?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.684
- All right.
- All set?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.982
- Mm-hmm.
- You got this.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.526
You always do.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.355
Yeah.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.023
Power grid was a prototype.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.783
I'm surprised it took this long
to start acting up.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.819
We'll get it going.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.954
Daylight's burning.
Let's go.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.835
I know I said it before,
but thank you.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.380
Yeah.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.141
( door closes)

07:14.935 --> 07:16.095
(engine starts)

07:16.270 --> 07:18.761
Tara: So, seriously, though,
what's her story?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.850
( loud dance music playing )

07:21.025 --> 07:23.107
Great, another mix.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.565
J‘ Now you're going to die. J‘

07:27.740 --> 07:29.651
Helps draw them away.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.383
(sighs)

07:53.557 --> 07:57.049
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.718
- What happened?
- I don't know.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.808
Maybe somebody
doesn't like owls?

08:03.859 --> 08:06.601
Someone came in here
and did this?

08:06.779 --> 08:08.440
Yeah.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.499
Stuff like this
never happens here.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.455
(sighs)

08:23.629 --> 08:26.416
Well, you got any enemies?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.504
You know anybody
who hates owls?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.510
( laughs)

08:34.640 --> 08:38.178
Well, too bad there isn't somebody
who could look into this kind of thing.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.597
I'll ask around.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.684
- No, you don't have to.
- Yeah, I know.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.443
Okay, so you find the person
who did this and then what?

08:49.613 --> 08:51.695
Some kind of consequences.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.232
You ever heard about
the broken window theory?

08:56.829 --> 09:00.071
Boils down to this--
you keep the windows intact,

09:00.249 --> 09:02.080
you keep society intact.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.623
This was an owl, Rick.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.459
Yeah. Yeah.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.970
- Tara: That's it there?
- That's the warehouse.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.430
Looks like that door
is our fastest way in and out.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.595
We should know all the exits first.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.731
- So there's a plan if things go south.
- Nicholas: Already got one.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.437
It's called going out the front.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.691
- Tara: Noah, heads up.
- ( walker snarling )

09:33.866 --> 09:35.356
Noah:
Got it.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.238
(silenced gunshot)

09:40.205 --> 09:42.241
Look at you with the aim.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.710
Glenn's right, we should do
a perimeter check.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.872
Know our exits just in case.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.135
(snarling )

10:09.985 --> 10:13.728
So you're aware, I'm on record
as stating that I should not be here.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.646
You well know
that I'm not combat ready

10:15.824 --> 10:17.940
or even for that matter
combat inclined.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.279
You never are till you are.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.534
But you got to start
pulling your weight.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.070
You know, I did.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.499
What?

10:27.669 --> 10:30.081
All things being equal,
I do believe my weight's been pulled.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.462
I got you all to DC, which,
in this man's opinion,

10:32.633 --> 10:35.124
is damn near nirvana
by current standards.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.258
Except you didn't get us here.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.341
We got you here.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.222
But were it not for me
and my mention

10:42.392 --> 10:44.303
of this city's potential
for home and hearth,

10:44.478 --> 10:46.309
not a one of you would have had
the vision to come here,

10:46.480 --> 10:50.769
let alone the cojones to travail
such a fraught and punishing pilgrimage.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.808
And that, sister, is a fact.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.398
That's as cold and hard
as they come.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.360
God, you're really
that much of a coward?

10:59.535 --> 11:02.698
Yes, I am.
I told you l was.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.754
It was good aim back there.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.836
Target practice helped.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.049
Actually, last week, l was pretty close
to practicing on Aiden.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.636
( laughs )
Me, too, man.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.263
(walkers snarling )

11:38.907 --> 11:41.239
Glenn:
Well, we're not getting out the front.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.202
( bangs)

11:55.924 --> 11:58.040
Give it another second.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.138
It's a big place.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.217
There could be some inside.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.723
So let's say they are.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.262
Let's move.
Let's be safe.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.317
All right.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.236
( door closes)

12:27.414 --> 12:29.370
Okay, let's move.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.261
- Tara.
- Yeah?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.592
- You got it?
- I got this aisle.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.603
( distant metal clanks )

13:04.493 --> 13:06.279
( metal cage rattles )

13:06.453 --> 13:08.318
Shh.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.489
- ( metal cage rattles )
- ( walkers snarling )

13:14.294 --> 13:16.285
They're stuck
behind something.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.454
How do you know?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.463
I don't.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.625
But they aren't here.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.636
All right.
Hey, let's go.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.592
Eyes up.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.806
(snarling continues)

13:38.944 --> 13:41.151
(snarling )

13:59.047 --> 14:01.003
- Glenn: Clear.
- Clear.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.505
You know your stuff.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.007
Tara:
We were out there a long time.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.088
Glenn:
There could be more.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.219
Aiden:
Let's get to work.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.803
You're up.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.187
This one here.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.123
- Yeah.
- We found 'em.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.591
- Here's another one.
- All right, Eugene.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.724
(walkers snarling )

14:58.732 --> 15:01.394
(snarling )

15:08.450 --> 15:10.111
(gunshot)

15:12.037 --> 15:14.403
( gunshots)

15:15.749 --> 15:18.456
It's got armor.
Let it come closer.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.867
I got it.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.787
( gunshots)

15:24.466 --> 15:26.206
Aiden, stop!

15:26.384 --> 15:27.373
Stop!

15:33.517 --> 15:36.634
( groans, coughs)

15:38.605 --> 15:40.812
(all coughing)

15:45.070 --> 15:46.731
( groans )

15:50.826 --> 15:52.191
(coughs)

15:52.369 --> 15:54.280
Oh, God.

15:56.665 --> 15:57.905
Oh, God.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.292
( Nicholas groans)
He's dead.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.300
(walkers snarling )

16:12.472 --> 16:14.963
Noah? Tara?
Eugene?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.310
- You good?
- Yeah.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.519
Cage is open.
They're getting out.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.685
- We need to find--
- Eugene: Here.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.654
Over here.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.159
Is she breathing?
Eugene!

16:44.337 --> 16:46.168
Eugene:
|-- I can't tell from right here.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.172
- ( snarling continues)
- Nicholas: They're getting close.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.048
Eugene:
Walker.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.887
- Eugene: Walker.
- ( snarling )

16:57.225 --> 17:00.183
Eugene, it's yours.
Take it out.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.354
(snarling )

17:18.538 --> 17:20.039
(gunshot)

17:23.543 --> 17:26.034
Get to that office.
I'll get Tara. Go!

17:28.381 --> 17:30.633
( rustling, cans rattling )

17:40.268 --> 17:42.429
What are you doing here?

17:42.604 --> 17:44.845
I didn't tell anybody
about the guns.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.230
- I swear to God.
- Answer my question.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.183
Do you have
any more cookies?

17:50.362 --> 17:51.602
The ones you made
for the party?

17:51.780 --> 17:53.941
They're gone.
Now go. Go home.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.730
My house doesn't have power.

17:55.909 --> 17:59.242
l was going to paint my owl statue,
but somebody broke it.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.242
None of these are problems, Sam.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.283
I don't care about your house.
I don't care about your statue.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.997
Now get out.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.082
- Can you make more cookies?
- No.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.999
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.212
Maybe if you showed me
how to make them,

18:15.387 --> 18:17.469
I could do it myself.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.344
You want cookies?

18:22.519 --> 18:26.262
All right, you're gonna have to steal
the chocolate from Olivia.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.055
And then you're gonna get
an extra bar for me.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.065
And if you get caught
or you say anything,

18:31.236 --> 18:32.567
you're not gonna like
what happens to you.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.273
Now go.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.440
(walkers snarling )

18:38.618 --> 18:40.449
- How's she doing?
- She has serious head trauma.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.952
- She's losing blood fast.
- How do we stop it?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.409
Med kit was in Aiden's pack.
It got blown to hell.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.572
Glenn:
There's another one in the van.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.128
She's on her way out.
We need to get her there.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.536
Glenn: All right,
we'll get her there.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.454
Aiden:
Help! Somebody!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.463
Nicholas:
Oh, Jesus.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.090
- ( groans )
- Glenn: He's alive?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.172
Nicholas: I checked him.
|-- I thought--

18:58.346 --> 19:00.211
- We've got to get him.
- Oh, Jesus.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.800
It's gonna take
at least three of us.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.590
We got that kind of time?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.633
We pull Aiden off there,
we could kill him.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.428
- So you're saying we leave him?
- Go, save him.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.392
She'd do it.
I know she would.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.900
I'll stay with her.
I'll keep her safe, I assure you.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.571
lwill.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.146
All right,
we'll knock 'em back.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.610
- You still have that flare?
- Yeah.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.740
You fire the flare
over the shelves.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.242
That'll draw some of them over.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.404
All right, we're gonna hit
the rest hand to hand.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.322
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.082
One, two, three.
( grunts )

19:34.507 --> 19:36.168
Come on!

19:54.194 --> 19:57.027
Tobin really think
this'll take four weeks?

19:57.197 --> 19:59.438
That's what he said.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.198
First time they expanded the wall,
it took 'em twice that.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.909
Hey, uh, you okay to hang tight?

20:09.084 --> 20:11.291
I need to send a fax
to Cleveland.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.469
( birds screeching )

20:40.782 --> 20:43.740
( heart beating )

21:04.305 --> 21:05.511
- ( gunshots )
- ( woman echoes ) Roamers!

21:05.682 --> 21:07.092
Bruce:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:07.267 --> 21:09.098
(walkers snarling )

21:09.269 --> 21:12.306
- ( panting )
- ( gunshots)

21:26.035 --> 21:27.741
Ah!

21:33.376 --> 21:35.537
Everybody,
back till we're safe in the truck.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.166
What about Francine?

21:41.342 --> 21:42.843
Damn it!

21:46.222 --> 21:48.634
Abraham!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.639
Come on.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.186
Up and in.
You first.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.442
( chuckles )
Mother dick.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.333
- Abraham.
- Heads up.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.376
You take out the ass end.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.885
I got the uglies in the front.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.342
That's it.
Single file.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.597
There we go.
Come on.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.508
Don't be shy.
Come on!

22:33.686 --> 22:35.392
Mother dick!

22:36.523 --> 22:38.514
(Abraham grunting )

22:39.776 --> 22:42.108
Hell, son of a bitch
is still alive.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.815
- What are you doing?
- Abraham: Come on!

22:44.989 --> 22:46.399
Making sure he stays that way.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.280
( gunshots)

22:53.122 --> 22:54.248
Hey, Rick,
just having a beer.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.701
Thought I'd bring you one
for helping my wife today.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.458
Um, I'm good, but thanks.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.086
Come on, don't tell me
you're still on duty.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.374
Kind of always am,
you know?

23:05.552 --> 23:08.544
Well, not at Deanna's party.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.257
I saw you.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.596
You had some, right?

23:17.146 --> 23:20.309
You know, lwish I could
have helped out more today.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.941
| asked around, but nobody
saw or heard anything.

23:24.112 --> 23:27.775
Well, it was just an owl.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.065
Grand scheme of things,
I think we'll live.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.323
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.036
I'm sorry.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.587
Heard you lost your wife.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.337
You know...

23:53.766 --> 23:56.553
I'm sure it looks like
we haven't lost much,

23:56.728 --> 23:58.264
but we have.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.429
We've lost things.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.770
Other things we'rejust
fighting like hell to hold on to.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.609
Everything you people
have been through,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.440
I don't know if you see that.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.111
We do.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.281
Bring your kids in
for a checkup.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.871
I know I offered you one,
but they really should come in.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.956
They were out there
a while, right?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.963
Yeah.
Thanks, Pete.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.845
Let's be friends, man.

24:34.015 --> 24:36.006
We kind of have to be, right?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.012
Yeah, we do.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.848
So we will.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.064
I'll see you, Rick.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.625
Eugene:
I take no responsibility for this.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.586
I told you what I was.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.465
You should've listened.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.968
All of you,
you should've listened.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.384
(walkers snarling )

25:25.817 --> 25:27.682
(flashlight clicks)

25:27.860 --> 25:30.818
(flare hissing )

25:40.540 --> 25:43.202
(walker snarling )

25:47.046 --> 25:49.833
(walker snarling )

25:51.467 --> 25:53.549
( gunshots)

25:57.181 --> 25:59.638
(groaning)

26:01.811 --> 26:04.518
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.645
All right?
Everything's gonna be okay.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.899
I need you to stay quiet, okay?
Can you do that?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.025
Okay.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.527
All right.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.868
One, two, three.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.491
- ( screams )
- Noah: The flare.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.368
lt's burning out.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.121
(whimpering)

26:24.292 --> 26:25.657
Come on.
Come on, again.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.918
- We're not gonna make this.
- Hey, yes, we are.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.874
But I need your help.
You can do this.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.710
Nick. Nick, don't--
don't leave me.

26:34.719 --> 26:38.257
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Glenn: Okay. Three!

26:38.431 --> 26:41.548
- ( gunshots)
- ( groaning)

26:52.069 --> 26:55.357
You left them.
We both did.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.271
That's who we are.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.032
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.788
I'm sorry.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.946
Noah:
They're coming.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.116
(Aiden screaming )

27:10.129 --> 27:13.542
Okay, it was-- it was us.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.547
The others before.

27:15.718 --> 27:18.710
They didn't panic.
We did.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.378
It was us.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.640
No.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.392
Noah:
They're here!

27:26.562 --> 27:28.098
(snarling )

27:28.272 --> 27:31.230
(screaming )

27:49.043 --> 27:50.328
( screams )

27:53.506 --> 27:53.540
That how it works with you?

27:53.548 --> 27:56.005
That how it works with you?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.131
You leave people behind to die?

27:58.302 --> 28:00.759
We have a system.
Tell him, Francine.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.340
- We have a--
- ( grunts )

28:03.432 --> 28:05.684
Asshole.

28:05.852 --> 28:10.312
Hey, all that noise
is bound to draw more.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.346
I say we call it and start fresh
in the morning, all right?

28:12.525 --> 28:14.686
Screw that.
Francine, you good?

28:16.737 --> 28:18.773
Got at least three hours
of daylight left.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.190
I want two lookouts.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.985
One in the bucket
and one on the trucks.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.323
Should give us
more than enough warning

28:27.498 --> 28:29.489
if more are coming
after the bash and pop.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.375
Now pull the cobwebs
out of your ass and move.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.421
We got a wall to build.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.679
- Glenn: Nicholas, stop!
- ( walkers snarling )

28:45.850 --> 28:49.217
Hey!
You'll never make it.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.266
Noah:
Heads up.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.688
- ( gun clicking)
- I'm out!

28:58.863 --> 29:00.399
Let's go!
Come on!

29:13.920 --> 29:16.753
Sorry to lose you, Tobin.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.164
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

29:20.259 --> 29:24.252
If Abraham had followed
my orders, she'd be dead.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.217
Yeah, well, saving someone's life
makes them a hero,

29:27.391 --> 29:31.225
but it doesn't qualify them
to run a construction crew.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.932
Well, they're still out there,

29:34.106 --> 29:36.939
still working,
the whole team.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.522
And he's leading them.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.980
Better than I ever could.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.952
I guess it's settled, then.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.789
l'll speak to Abraham when he's back
and make it official.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.832
Yeah.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.801
Thank you, Deanna.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.635
And the thing is,

30:10.810 --> 30:12.926
I know you won't regret it.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.626
He's right, you know?

30:39.797 --> 30:42.083
Abraham's more than qualified.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.840
( chuckles )

30:47.179 --> 30:48.589
I put another one
of your people

30:48.764 --> 30:52.177
in a position of power,
you vouch for them.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.513
It's becoming a pattern.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.303
Maggie:
We know what we're doing.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.480
It's why you wanted us here.

31:01.944 --> 31:05.687
It's why Aaron and Daryl
are out there looking for more people.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.821
You wanted a future.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.234
You need us for that.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.157
That's right.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.369
I'll go get back to work
on those field plans.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.752
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.295
( knocking )

31:38.064 --> 31:39.429
After these are done, that's it.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.393
I'm not helping you again
and you're not coming back.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.398
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.901
I hope you're not expecting to leave
with more than half of these.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.063
You barely did half the work.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.858
Were you always a good cook?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.075
Sam, we're not talking.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.995
( runs water)

32:01.170 --> 32:03.252
Wipe the counter.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.413
(sighs)

32:06.467 --> 32:09.004
Did you like it?
Cooking?

32:09.178 --> 32:10.634
You know, before.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.636
Sam.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.386
We don't have to be friends.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.676
Just doesn't have to be quiet.

32:21.649 --> 32:24.436
l was good at it.
It distracted me.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.817
It made me forget
when l was sad.

32:26.987 --> 32:30.115
Sometimes when | get sad,
I break stuff.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.784
What kind of stuff?

32:37.915 --> 32:39.826
You said somebody
broke your owl statue.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.661
Did you break it?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.752
Why?

32:49.927 --> 32:51.918
Why are you here?

32:54.682 --> 32:56.798
Why did you steal the guns?

32:59.311 --> 33:02.098
Because sometimes you need
to protect yourself.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.484
Can I have a gun?

33:11.073 --> 33:12.859
Why do you want one?

33:15.161 --> 33:17.072
It's not for me.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.658
Who's it for?

33:23.878 --> 33:25.994
Sam, who's it for?

33:32.970 --> 33:36.007
- Sam.
- ( door opens, closes)

33:36.182 --> 33:38.423
(snarling )

33:44.481 --> 33:47.018
Hey, maybe-- maybe we can
shoot our way past them.

33:47.193 --> 33:50.185
- You guys still have guns.
- And you have the ammo.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.353
We've got to do
something, man.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.237
We're gonna die in here.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.448
There has to be another way.
There has to be a way.

34:01.373 --> 34:05.116
- ( dance music blaring )
- ( horn honks)

34:05.294 --> 34:07.751
- Hey! Hey! Over here.
-( banging )

34:07.922 --> 34:11.540
- Come get me. Come get me.
-( horn honks)

34:11.717 --> 34:14.049
Come on.
Come on.

34:15.262 --> 34:18.379
- Come and get me.
-( honking, banging)

34:26.190 --> 34:28.556
Come on, Eugene.
Yeah.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.244
All right. Hey.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.746
I need you both--
hey, Nicholas!

34:44.917 --> 34:47.750
I need you both to keep
the door steady, all right?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.582
I'm gonna break the glass.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.917
We get out, you push out.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.377
We get the rifle and we're good.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.927
All right?
All right?

34:56.095 --> 34:57.585
Ready?

35:02.935 --> 35:06.268
No! No, stop!
It's not safe!

35:06.438 --> 35:08.429
- Glenn: This is the only way.
- No, it's not gonna break.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.723
It will, okay?
We can hold it.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.437
We can.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.567
Trust me, okay?
Count of three.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.901
Count of three.
One, two--

35:18.075 --> 35:19.861
- Nicholas: No!
- Hey! Hey!

35:20.035 --> 35:22.117
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

35:22.288 --> 35:25.075
Nicholas!
Nicholas, don't! Nicholas!

35:25.249 --> 35:28.241
- Damn it, Nicholas, no!
- Nicholas!

35:31.588 --> 35:33.624
- Don't!
- No.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.040
Hey, Nicholas, don't do it!

35:36.218 --> 35:38.083
No, no!

35:38.262 --> 35:40.503
- No!
- Don't let go.

35:40.681 --> 35:43.468
( both scream )

35:43.642 --> 35:46.725
Noah!Noah!Noah!

35:48.314 --> 35:49.599
No!

35:52.067 --> 35:56.606
(screaming )

36:12.463 --> 36:15.500
( screaming stops )

36:15.674 --> 36:17.665
(snarling, tearing )

36:31.899 --> 36:34.356
Hey! Hey!

36:34.526 --> 36:36.608
Move over.
We're leaving.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.188
(shuts off engine)

36:41.367 --> 36:42.732
Get back in the van.

36:42.910 --> 36:44.775
Not until you tell me
where they are.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.662
Eﬂheryou
come back with me

36:48.832 --> 36:50.368
or you stay here
and you die with your friends.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.373
Those are your choices.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.479
(voice breaking )
Help me get him in the back.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.193
Where's Noah?

37:28.288 --> 37:30.574
( knocking )

37:37.131 --> 37:38.837
( knocks )

37:43.262 --> 37:45.344
Hi. Carol, right?

37:45.514 --> 37:47.675
That's right.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.966
Do you need something?

37:50.144 --> 37:51.600
Not feeling well?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.557
l was with Sam earlier.
Is he okay?

37:56.191 --> 37:58.443
Why wouldn't he be?

38:01.989 --> 38:03.854
Can I talk to Jessie?

38:04.032 --> 38:05.818
Not a good time.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.117
Pete, don't.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.481
Gabriel, what is it?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.614
- I need to speak with you.
- Come-- come in.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.992
- Privately.
- All right.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.210
Satan...

39:00.380 --> 39:03.508
he disguises himself
as the angel of light.

39:04.551 --> 39:09.136
I'm afraid that false light is here
inside these walls.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.721
Your community,

39:11.892 --> 39:15.976
you say it's not a paradise,
but it is.

39:16.146 --> 39:19.513
I'm grateful to be here.
I am.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.934
But you made a mistake
letting in the others.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.852
How so?

39:27.491 --> 39:29.106
Rick...

39:30.202 --> 39:32.067
his group...

39:34.623 --> 39:37.365
they're not good people.

39:37.543 --> 39:40.376
They've done things.

39:40.546 --> 39:43.663
They've done
unspeakable things.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.580
( door opens)

39:51.014 --> 39:53.221
Pete's hitting Jessie.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.724
Maybe Sam, too.

39:58.772 --> 40:01.263
Deanna: To make it out there
as long as they did,

40:01.441 --> 40:02.977
they must have done things.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.437
Rick said as much.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.819
They survived.

40:07.990 --> 40:09.571
That's what makes them assets.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.357
You're wrong.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.868
They can't be trusted.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.620
They're dangerous.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.248
You may believe that they did
what they had to do,

40:20.419 --> 40:23.707
that they were afraid
and so they--

40:23.880 --> 40:25.745
Listen up!

40:25.924 --> 40:28.415
- Gabriel: The day will come...
- We made a damn good dent today.

40:28.594 --> 40:31.927
...when they'll put their own lives
before yours and everyone else's

40:32.097 --> 40:35.430
and they will destroy
everything you have here,

40:35.601 --> 40:37.717
everything you're working
so hard to build.

40:37.894 --> 40:39.270
| suggest you all call it
an early night.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.520
You know this how?

40:41.690 --> 40:43.851
Sam tell you?

40:45.110 --> 40:47.317
He didn't have to.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.272
Deanna: Why are you just now
coming to me with this?

40:51.450 --> 40:53.736
Satan,

40:53.910 --> 40:58.700
he disguises himself
as the angel of light.

40:58.874 --> 41:01.832
His servants are the false apostles
of righteousness.

41:02.002 --> 41:05.119
They don't deserve this.
They don't deserve paradise.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.791
Thank you, Gabriel.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.633
l have a lot to think about.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.314
| only wish I had come
to you sooner.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.315
| just--

41:30.739 --> 41:32.695
I hope it isn't too late.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.073
( door closes)

41:43.418 --> 41:46.160
(van approaches )

41:46.338 --> 41:49.330
- ( door opens )
- Glenn: Help! I need help!

41:49.508 --> 41:51.464
(sighs)

41:52.844 --> 41:55.176
Carol:
Rick.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.172
I know how this
is gonna go with Pete.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.969
There's only one way it can go.

42:11.905 --> 42:14.317
You're gonna have to kill him.

42:21.707 --> 42:24.619
