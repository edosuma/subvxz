Man: Are 9 stories
above a busy city street.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.664
Does that scare you?

18:53.666 --> 18:54.464
No.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.200
Not really.
Should it?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.100
Well, yeah.

18:57.102 --> 19:02.340
Because we are talking
about a bungee jump.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.875
Aren't you scared?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.309
No.
Are you?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.209
Why would I be...

19:06.211 --> 19:08.146
here we go, pretty boy!
Aah!

19:08.248 --> 19:10.982
Oh... Shego!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.817
[Band plays out of commercial]

19:12.819 --> 19:14.318
Huh?

19:14.920 --> 19:17.989
And... We are... Back.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.023
I'm Ron,

19:19.025 --> 19:23.194
and we are talking
to Dr. Drakken,

19:23.196 --> 19:23.894
who is...

19:23.896 --> 19:27.899
Here... To talk about...

19:27.901 --> 19:29.233
Uh... This book.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.435
Your book?
Apparently.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.404
Ooh. Great.
What is it about?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.806
Uh... Me.
It's about me.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.341
Yeah, you've been
threatening to write a book

19:37.343 --> 19:39.143
for a while. Can you
tell me more?

19:39.145 --> 19:42.313
Well... I...

19:42.315 --> 19:44.248
I rather like me.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.285
Ok, now, pick a triangle.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.153
Uh, can I pick Kim twice?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.389
Why doesn't anybody pick me?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.157
'Cause you're
the creepy blue guy.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.425
Blue is so last season.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.960
This year it's evil umber.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.129
Blue skin? That means
he's not breathing!

19:58.131 --> 20:00.264
Somebody get the jaws of life!

20:00.266 --> 20:03.000
Wait. Things are getting
seriously moopy here.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.203
I know. With every
passing dimension,

20:05.205 --> 20:06.303
reality gets weaker.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.173
Only a few more shows
and it'll all be obliterated.

20:09.175 --> 20:09.973
What can we do?

20:09.975 --> 20:11.473
I think I know a way
to zap you back,

20:11.475 --> 20:13.911
but there's too much
interference from the vortex.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.411
If only there was a way
to plug it up.

20:15.413 --> 20:18.316
Wait a minute. The shows are
following the schedule!

20:18.318 --> 20:20.218
Wade, can you change
the channel order...

20:20.220 --> 20:21.285
make <i>ape island</i> next?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.185
Yeah. But why?

20:22.187 --> 20:27.058
This began with monkeys,
it's gonna end with monkeys.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.027
Ok, Wade, now!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.102
Rufus, banana me!

20:38.104 --> 20:39.270
Heh heh heh heh.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.472
Hold on. This is gonna
get hairy.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.908
Kim: Here they come.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.209
Uh, what comes where?

20:45.211 --> 20:46.310
I blame you for this.

Whoa!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.303
Thanks, K.P.

21:12.305 --> 21:15.072
So not the drama.
But that is.

Ok...

21:20.847 --> 21:23.247
Uhh... uhh...
ow.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.147
How we doing?

21:24.149 --> 21:25.149
Everything appears stable.

21:25.251 --> 21:25.949
Come, Shego.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.752
I made some repairs
to the compiler.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.288
It's time to leave
this travesty.

[Weak whine]

21:39.164 --> 21:41.332
Go, Wade.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.867
I never thought I'd be glad

21:42.869 --> 21:45.036
to be back in Drakken's place.

21:45.038 --> 21:48.306
Cool, they've got cable!

21:48.308 --> 21:50.107
Uh, actually, you know,
on second thought,

21:50.109 --> 21:52.476
I think I'll stick to
video games for a while.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.476
Let's get this back

21:53.478 --> 21:56.280
and hope they lock it
up better this time.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.280
You're the man, Wade.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.250
Everything's back to normal...
Mostly.

21:59.252 --> 22:00.584
So what happened to Drakken?

22:00.586 --> 22:03.220
Looks like he took a detour.
