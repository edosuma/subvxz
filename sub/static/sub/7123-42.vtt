Jake?

00:36.269 --> 00:38.669
Jake?

00:40.407 --> 00:42.341
- Hey, man.
- Hey, dude.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.001
You still thinking about...

00:44.077 --> 00:45.271
Yeah.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.939
Yeah? Me, too.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.538
Princess Bubblegum's
ready for us,

00:49.616 --> 00:51.982
so we should go. - Okay.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.329
Just give me a few
more months in here

00:53.353 --> 00:54.684
and I'll be ready.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.813
It's okay, man. Just...
just play it off.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.687
Just make a-a normal face.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.988
See? Normal face.

01:09.102 --> 01:12.503
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.769
We may begin the ceremony!

01:30.423 --> 01:32.234
Thanks for bringing us
along on the trip, Peebs.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.021
Yeah. It's unfortunate
we can't enjoy

01:34.094 --> 01:35.774
some of these cool
things we're passing by,

01:35.829 --> 01:37.023
but I guess we could do that

01:37.097 --> 01:38.894
the next time we're in
the Desert of Wonders,

01:38.965 --> 01:39.989
whenever that is!

01:40.066 --> 01:42.125
We're on a mission to
collect samples only.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.965
I want to start
colonizing this area

01:44.037 --> 01:45.334
by the end of the year.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.168
You are killing me, PB!

01:47.240 --> 01:49.504
James, give a readout on fuel.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.134
Right away, Princess.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.577
Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet!

01:55.648 --> 01:57.582
We have a surplus of fuel,

01:57.650 --> 02:01.142
so after we collect
samples, we may explore.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.153
Yeah!

02:02.222 --> 02:04.019
I'm glad James is on this trip.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.149
Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!

02:12.465 --> 02:14.797
Dude, James is kind
of, uh, goofy.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.302
I wasn't gonna say
anything, but yeah.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.810
Maybe when we get
to know him better,

02:18.872 --> 02:20.203
it'll be charming.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.673
James, slow down. We're here.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.574
I'm registering mondo
mega rads down there.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.584
I'll ready the radiation
suits upon landing.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.745
Excellent. Take us down.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.982
Hold on to your sack lunch!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.774
Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!

02:55.842 --> 02:57.104
Okay.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.441
You guys collect as many
surface samples as you can...

02:59.512 --> 03:01.946
rocks, plants, dirt, anything.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.575
Mostly looks like
it's just dirt here.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.243
This will be fun.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.584
Jake, open up the basket.
I'm gonna make a shot!

03:09.656 --> 03:10.554
Do it!

03:10.623 --> 03:11.954
Chk-chk! Whoop!

03:12.025 --> 03:13.151
Ha ha!

03:14.227 --> 03:16.127
Wah-wah!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.493
Hmm.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.398
Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!

03:27.473 --> 03:29.304
Guys, run!

03:33.947 --> 03:35.881
James, speed up that sack lunch!

03:35.949 --> 03:37.026
Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!

03:37.050 --> 03:38.574
Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Vrrt! Vrrt!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.220
Ugh!

03:45.925 --> 03:48.120
Whoa! Ugh!

03:51.364 --> 03:52.956
Ugh!

03:53.032 --> 03:54.192
Everyone okay?

03:55.935 --> 03:57.334
Huh?

03:57.403 --> 04:00.031
Oh, my garf! What are they?!

04:01.441 --> 04:04.899
Uh, they're toxic creatures
from another time.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.309
Okay, let's see...

04:06.379 --> 04:08.313
suspension's all donked,
navigation's lost,

04:08.381 --> 04:10.281
and the ship's legs are kaput.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.544
We're dead in the water.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.978
Chk! Ah-oogah!

04:17.923 --> 04:21.223
Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners!

04:23.730 --> 04:26.164
Gotta brain out the situation.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.501
Those goo monsters will barf
their way through the hull

04:30.570 --> 04:31.832
in mere minutes.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.236
Finn, what should we do?

04:34.307 --> 04:36.798
Uh... let's radio for help.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.743
Good idea, but looks like
the radio's kaplowed.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.076
Pbbt! I can fix that radio.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.809
Mrow-row-row!

04:43.883 --> 04:45.680
Pling!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.014
With this!

04:47.086 --> 04:49.179
It's a lucky coin! Bam!

04:49.255 --> 04:53.021
When I bust out my coin,
great stuff happens,

04:53.092 --> 04:55.526
like when I was chosen
to go on this mission

04:55.595 --> 04:57.222
with you guys! Hee
hee hee hee hee!

04:57.297 --> 05:00.095
Mnh. Mnh. James,
that's not helping!

05:00.166 --> 05:01.929
- Don't panic, baby.
- Yes.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.231
James is very resourceful.
He'll work it out.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.501
Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet!

05:07.573 --> 05:10.508
Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr!

05:10.576 --> 05:13.136
Look, Princess... I
invented a coin-operated

05:13.212 --> 05:16.909
coin screwdrive-e-e-r!

05:16.983 --> 05:19.144
See what I mean?
Good job, James.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.515
Come on, guys.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.747
Let's take inventory
of the emergency gear.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.757
Lucky coin strikes again!

05:27.093 --> 05:29.618
Hey, Preebros, I know
things seem bad,

05:29.696 --> 05:30.890
but I'll figure out a plan.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.453
I know, Finn.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.365
Dude, I found us some flares!
I saved us!

05:35.435 --> 05:36.993
Right on!

05:37.070 --> 05:39.561
Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!

05:39.639 --> 05:41.971
Good grod! I love you, James!

05:42.041 --> 05:44.236
I knew you could do it, James!

05:44.310 --> 05:46.270
You know, James, I wasn't
sure about you at first,

05:46.312 --> 05:47.609
but you're okay.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.478
Thanks, Jake. I wasn't
sure about you, either.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.313
Chk-chk. - James...

05:52.385 --> 05:54.250
the radio's still not working!

05:55.621 --> 05:58.283
I'm not getting any signal.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.882
What the skunk?

06:01.127 --> 06:03.118
James, it's all sanched up!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.925
James is like, "wha?!"

06:04.997 --> 06:07.591
It was working just a
second ago, I swears!

06:07.667 --> 06:09.567
I went, like, "choo-choo-choo!"

06:09.635 --> 06:11.102
And the radio was like,

06:11.170 --> 06:13.104
"pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-
whichoo-whichoo,"

06:13.172 --> 06:14.662
and then I was like...

06:14.741 --> 06:17.403
I take it back. This
guy's totally cuckoo!

06:17.477 --> 06:19.741
This is my cuckoo face.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.473
He did his best, you guys.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.037
Right, right.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.413
Okay, time for plan "B."

06:24.484 --> 06:26.281
James, pass me them flares.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.149
Chk-oo! Boop!

06:28.221 --> 06:30.849
A flare for my liege.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.589
James, where are the flares?

06:35.661 --> 06:37.026
What?!

06:37.096 --> 06:40.930
May... maybe they're,
uh, invisible flares.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.429
Finn, PB, can I speak to you

06:45.505 --> 06:47.632
in the other room, please?

06:49.942 --> 06:51.687
You want to do this
trust-huddle style, buddy?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.542
Mm.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.012
So, what's all the hubbub?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.412
What's up with that James dude?

06:56.482 --> 06:58.882
Yeah. Do you think James could
be breaking things on purpose?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.510
No. James wouldn't do that.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.486
Wake up! Dude's a saboteur.

07:02.555 --> 07:05.388
- It's not James.
- What's not James?

07:06.392 --> 07:07.882
I got lonely up front.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.951
I wanted to see what
y'all are up to.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.758
Hey, that gives me an idea.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.423
Me, too! Vrrt!

07:13.499 --> 07:16.024
Just kidding! I don't
have any ideas.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.896
Diversion.
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Diversion.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.567
Time to set up a diversion.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.757
- You see anything, bruddah?
- Ah, I got bunkus.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.422
Wait.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.796
If we jam up to that cliff
face, I think we can climb...

07:47.867 --> 07:49.391
Whoop. More goo bros.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.871
What the...

08:04.116 --> 08:05.310
Yah!

08:06.786 --> 08:08.879
That won't hold them for long.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.549
It can't end like this. I
got a lady and five kids!

08:11.624 --> 08:13.683
I thought I'd outlive
at least one of them!

08:13.759 --> 08:15.852
Here, man. Take this.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.293
Your lucky coin?

08:17.363 --> 08:19.923
Yeah, man. It always
keeps me calm.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.864
Who shot that flare, James?

08:21.934 --> 08:23.834
We don't have time
to point fingers.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.461
You're right.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.130
There's only one way
out of this jam.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.969
One of us has to eat the big one

08:29.041 --> 08:30.804
so the others can survive.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.379
And I'm gonna be that one.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.381
I'll run up there, get the
creatures to chase me,

08:36.448 --> 08:39.077
and while they're busy
noshing on my teen-boy body,

08:39.150 --> 08:40.674
you three can climb to safety.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.277
Don't try to talk me out of it.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.947
I got crystal certainty.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.820
This is what it
means to be a he...

08:49.462 --> 08:50.622
Wha?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.663
James, we need to talk.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.663
So, what do you say?

09:00.740 --> 09:04.141
Sure thing, Princess!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.210
Byong!

09:07.013 --> 09:08.947
Ugh! Huh? Why did...

09:09.015 --> 09:10.846
Jake?

09:12.418 --> 09:14.079
Wh-Where's James?

09:14.153 --> 09:15.745
Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!

09:17.490 --> 09:19.151
James!

09:30.670 --> 09:32.831
Aah! James, look out!

09:32.905 --> 09:35.499
Ohh. PB! What's going on?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.510
Finn, I need to explain
something really heavy.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.944
I was the one who sabotaged
all your escape plans.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.675
I calculated the
chance of success

09:43.749 --> 09:45.717
for every possible escape plan,

09:45.785 --> 09:47.946
and none of them
were going to work.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.285
You said it yourself...
there was only one way out.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.723
Someone was going to
have to eat the big one

09:53.793 --> 09:55.658
to save the others.

09:55.728 --> 09:59.186
James did something
really noble to save us.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.130
But I wanted to do it.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.827
Why didn't you let me?

10:02.902 --> 10:04.802
There's a reason.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.634
With this sample of James,
I can clone a new one.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.107
He's candy, but you're not.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.804
I can't clone another you.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.368
Whoa.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.110
I made the best
choice available.

10:18.184 --> 10:22.416
James served the candy kingdom
on a dangerous mission,

10:22.488 --> 10:24.217
and even though he is gone,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.121
and it's super sad,

10:26.192 --> 10:29.025
I would like to honor James...

10:29.095 --> 10:32.360
with this new James I
whipped up in the lab!

10:32.431 --> 10:33.921
Jeet!

10:34.000 --> 10:37.231
Here you go, James...
an award for bravery.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.430
Let's hear it for James!

10:41.674 --> 10:44.609
Is this right or wrong?
I can't tell.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.544
Hey, cool. Did I
do something cool?

10:47.613 --> 10:49.342
Do I do something cool?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.746
I don't know, man.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.977
Here's your coin, James.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.679
Gzzt!

10:54.754 --> 10:58.520
Wow! This day keeps getting
better and better!

10:58.591 --> 11:00.320
Ehh.
