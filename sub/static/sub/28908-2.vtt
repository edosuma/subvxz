WEBVTT

00:13.346 --> 00:16.933
Hey, last day of summer school! 
We lived, we laughed, we learned.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.394
Some of us more than others.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.273
Yay, we did it. We had no fun all summer.
Whoo.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.357
[Gabe chuckles]

00:25.025 --> 00:28.570
You know, the next time you see me,
I'll be wearing my fall shorts.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.740
Hey, Marisol, what are you selling?

00:31.823 --> 00:34.075
-Reverse mortgages? Squatty Potties?
-Ay! Shh!

00:34.784 --> 00:36.911
Yes, solar power is expensive,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.622
but what price do you put
on saving the planet?

00:39.914 --> 00:41.458
Oh, here comes the kill shot.

00:41.916 --> 00:42.959
Finish him!

00:45.336 --> 00:48.465
Yeah, well, you know who thanks me
every day for putting panels on our home?

00:49.049 --> 00:49.883
My grandchildren.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.429
Great! I'll have my assistant call you
to set up an appointment. [softly] Yes!

00:54.679 --> 00:58.141
Yeah! You know, I've seen Teen Mom,
but I've never seen Teen Grandma.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.563
Well, when I'm selling solar panels,
I've got two grandkids.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.857
When I'm signing people up
for wrongful death lawsuits,

01:05.940 --> 01:07.442
I'm a widow from Detroit.

01:08.109 --> 01:12.155
And when I work at 7-Eleven,
I got a brother who's a UFC fighter

01:12.238 --> 01:13.615
waiting in the parking lot.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.535
All right, well,
I am excited to meet your grandkids,

01:17.619 --> 01:19.496
-I'm so sorry for your loss,
-Thank you.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.706
and remind me not to mess
with your brother.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.665
[chuckles]

01:23.291 --> 01:26.920
Wait a minute, I love the UFC.
Can your brother hook us up with tickets?

01:30.965 --> 01:32.550
Lorenzo... [chuckles]

01:32.634 --> 01:34.385
...her brother is as real
as her grandkids.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.680
Great, so where are we at
with these tickets?

01:39.849 --> 01:42.060
Pay attention, fool.
Her stupid grandkids got 'em.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.144
What?

01:45.396 --> 01:47.148
Could this summer get any worse?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.651
Look, I know it doesn't feel like it,

01:49.734 --> 01:52.403
but in reality,
we are the big winners here, okay?

01:52.487 --> 01:55.365
This is my impression of someone
who didn't have summer school.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.785
[in high-pitched voice]
"Oh, my God! Summer, yes! [giggles]

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
Let's go to the beach!

02:00.453 --> 02:03.832
Wow, sand! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

02:03.915 --> 02:07.502
Oh, frozen banana!
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold!

02:07.752 --> 02:09.295
Oh, let's go swimming!

02:09.379 --> 02:10.338
Ouch!

02:10.964 --> 02:13.591
-Who lost a syringe?"
-[students laugh]

02:14.551 --> 02:17.804
[in normal voice] All right, everyone,
we are one oral report away

02:17.887 --> 02:18.972
from passing summer school.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.765
[chuckles] Oral.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.645
Yeah, Walt, they said it couldn't be done,

02:25.728 --> 02:28.398
but you did it, not once, not twice,

02:29.232 --> 02:30.441
but ten "orals."

02:33.278 --> 02:36.865
Ah, sorry I'm late. I was watching
that Lincoln documentary you told us to.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.825
Lincoln was a real badass.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.369
No president killed more vampires
than that guy.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.082
Not that documentary,
but a very underrated film.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.419
Yeah, the way he killed Dracula
with that ax handle. Oh!

02:49.502 --> 02:50.420
Very presidential.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.422
[chuckles]

02:53.339 --> 02:55.842
You know, in the--
in the Lincoln movie I watched, he said,

02:56.217 --> 02:58.469
[imitating Lincoln]
"Until every drop of blood drawn

02:58.553 --> 03:01.764
with the lash shall be paid
by another drawn with the sword."

03:02.390 --> 03:03.725
[in normal voice]
Second inaugural address,

03:03.808 --> 03:05.643
Lincoln from way downtown. Bang!

03:06.811 --> 03:08.396
[chuckles] Careful, Mikey.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.149
People don't like to hear "Lincoln"
and "bang" in the same sentence.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.152
Good job!  You know, if you had brought it
like that all summer,

03:14.235 --> 03:16.362
you wouldn't need to nail this report
on Honest Abe.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.448
Yes, on our greatest president,

03:18.573 --> 03:20.950
who we honor by putting
on our cheapest coin.

03:21.034 --> 03:26.039
[laughs] Is that what-- Cheapest--
Amazing. [sighs]

03:28.416 --> 03:29.417
Uh...

03:31.336 --> 03:33.546
What about you, Grace?
Are you ready for this final?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.173
[computer] Yeah, dog.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.967
I was born ready.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.638
You know, being that your presentation
is on Susan B. Anthony,

03:41.721 --> 03:45.099
it might be a good idea
to put your computer in a female voice.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.268
[computer] This is a female voice.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.853
Check your privilege.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.940
You are part of the problem.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.193
No, Grace. [laughs]
I'm not part of the problem.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.987
And by the way, this is a female voice.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.906
[in female voice]
"And I told him, 'Look...

04:00.657 --> 04:02.367
I don't play, baby, okay?

04:02.450 --> 04:05.495
If you bring that weak ass game
up in here, it is gon' get sent.'"

04:07.038 --> 04:09.415
Oh, my God, that's a killer
Principal Madison impression.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.501
[in normal voice]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:11.584 --> 04:15.046
Whoa, that's not Principal Madison.
That's-- That's just some random lady.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.800
Well, whoever it is, she's sexy as hell!

04:20.551 --> 04:23.054
[in female voice]
Oh, you know how to make a girl blush.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.973
[theme song playing]

04:25.056 --> 04:26.557
♪ Mr. Iglesias ♪

04:29.560 --> 04:31.562
♪ Mr. Iglesias ♪

04:33.898 --> 04:37.068
Mm-hmm.
And I told him, "Look, I don't play, baby.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.363
You bring that weak ass game up in here,
it is gon' get sent."

04:42.407 --> 04:43.574
I gotta go, Mom.

04:46.786 --> 04:47.704
What's up, Paula?

04:47.954 --> 04:51.624
Ah, Gabriel, is it true that your kids
we counseled out are suddenly passing?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.877
Yeah, as it turns out, all they needed
was someone who cares about their future.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.630
Yeah, what's that called again?
A... teacher.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.675
Well, if they all pass their final,

05:00.758 --> 05:03.761
my pilot program will be off
to a roaring start.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.430
You know who'll really be impressed?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.390
Um, besides you with yourself?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.852
My friend
at the Long Beach Press-Telegram.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.982
We'll call my program "Paula's Pals"
or "Madison's Marvels."

05:16.399 --> 05:19.068
Ah. He's a writer, he'll figure it out.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.405
So, tell me the good news?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.949
Real estate flyers?
You're leaving us to sell houses?

05:26.284 --> 05:27.577
That's good news.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.288
No, Gabriel, proof.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.582
The better the schools,
the higher their property value.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.626
Once we get rid of the poor students,
our test scores go up,

05:35.710 --> 05:36.711
and then, the equity

05:36.794 --> 05:38.755
on my real estate portfolio goes
through the roof.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.467
Carlos, your one-bedroom fixer
in Norwalk is not a portfolio.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.430
So, tell me,

05:47.513 --> 05:49.891
how many of Gabriel's underachieving kids
are we getting rid of?

05:50.224 --> 05:53.019
Seriously, dude?
Do you feed off the tears of children?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.105
They're full of electrolytes.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.691
[sighs]

06:00.276 --> 06:02.070
Gabe, forgive Carlos.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.488
He's a first-time home owner.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.657
And like a vegan with his diet,
that's all he can talk about.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.954
My home would be worth twice its value
if I lived near Lakewood High.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.831
Why don't you just get a house near there?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.000
'Cause the houses there
are twice as expensive!

06:17.335 --> 06:19.295
I know, I just like to make him get all...
[growls]

06:19.796 --> 06:21.422
[laughs, growls]

06:22.340 --> 06:24.884
-Lakewood is my dream school.
-[Gabe sighs]

06:25.134 --> 06:26.219
Uh, I'm sorry, Carlos,

06:26.719 --> 06:29.472
but Gabe's kids have a decent shot
at pulling this off.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.934
When is Gabriel going to accept
that not all kids are created equal?

06:33.351 --> 06:36.479
When you admit they bought
your life rights to do the Grinch movie.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.150
Students fall into two categories:

06:41.234 --> 06:43.027
those that are destined to go to college,

06:43.111 --> 06:45.613
and those that are destined
to clean adult movie theaters.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.033
They don't even have
adult movie theaters anymore.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.119
[scoffs] Yeah, they do.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.376
Look, my kids are gonna pass their final,

06:58.584 --> 07:00.503
and they're gonna crush your dreams
of expelling them.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.840
Okay, we are going to grade them
the Lakewood way.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.716
Yay, the Lakewood way!

07:05.800 --> 07:07.093
What's the Lakewood way?

07:08.177 --> 07:10.555
A different teacher will be grading
Gabriel's class final,

07:10.888 --> 07:12.306
so there's no malfeasance.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.391
Mm-hmm.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
"Malfeasance"?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.688
Somebody's been playing
Words With Friends.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.359
Wait, yeah, you don't have any friends.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.282
I don't care who grades my kids
because they're all gonna pass, all right?

07:29.365 --> 07:32.243
And the Press-Telegram is gonna do
an amazing article

07:32.326 --> 07:34.745
on the best principal in Long Beach.

07:35.079 --> 07:38.166
Aw, you know how to make a girl blush.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.380
-Just grade my kids' finals.
-Mm, let me think about that.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.631
Hard pass.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.217
-Come on.
-Can't, bud.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.927
-Why not?
-Don't wanna.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.388
Ask Mr. Hayward.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.432
Nope, not teaching summer school.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.766
Then why are you here?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.685
My wife is at home.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.315
Hey, ask Abby. She loves work.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.110
[sighs] Man, Abby's an honest, moral,
upstanding citizen.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.737
You know, not you.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.699
Now I'm insulted.
But I'll do it for 20 bucks.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.034
-[chuckles]
-All right.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.369
-That's my Tony. All right.
-All right.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.537
I would've given you 40.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.250
-Hey, guys.
-[all] Hey!

08:21.334 --> 08:23.503
-Beautiful flowers for a beautiful lady.
-[chuckles]

08:23.586 --> 08:25.087
Oh, if I was a younger man--

08:25.421 --> 08:28.508
Then you'd know how much things
have changed in the workplace.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.556
My fiancé, Danny, sent me these
for absolutely no reason.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.016
[both] Uh-oh.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.894
What-oh?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.563
Well, I gave a lot of flowers
for no reason,

08:42.647 --> 08:45.399
but it was always for... the same reason.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.527
What reason?

08:48.778 --> 08:50.613
-Love, right, Mr. Hayward?
-[Ray] Uh-huh.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.075
Well, uh, yeah, in a way.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.163
The love I expressed
during my regrettable peregrinations

08:59.247 --> 09:00.581
into matters of the flesh

09:01.249 --> 09:04.585
outside of the covenant I made
with God and Gertrude.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.588
That means he had a side piece.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.923
-[Tony whistles]
-[gasps]

09:12.552 --> 09:16.430
Oh, Mr. Hayward,
I am not judging you at all,

09:16.639 --> 09:17.765
but Danny would never.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.601
He is the most honest person
I have ever met.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.687
Besides me.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.773
I can't believe I almost lied
and said it was him. It's me.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.360
And that's why I can't have her grade
the kids' finals.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.531
Ooh! Pretty flowers.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.157
Danny sent them to Abigail.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.450
For no reason!

09:37.076 --> 09:39.537
-Uh-oh.
-Seriously, what-oh?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.706
[chuckles] Relax, have a seat.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.500
Look, everyone's just jealous
of your beautiful flowers

09:44.584 --> 09:47.378
celebrating your rock-solid
long-distance relationship.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.337
Mm-hmm.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.423
So, Gabe,
do I have to listen to your kids' finals,

09:50.506 --> 09:52.008
or can I just give you the grades now?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.468
No way.
Tony's even less ethical than Gabriel.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.471
Well, you heard him. I'm out.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.683
But I'm gonna need that 20.
A deal's a deal.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.601
Mm.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.103
Gabe, if you need someone,
I'll grade your kids.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.855
I love those guys.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.317
Yeah, you know what? Uh,
thank you, but you just got those flowers,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.402
and you gotta write that thank-you letter
to Danny,

10:11.485 --> 10:13.654
you know, and fold it
and put it in the envelope--

10:13.738 --> 10:14.989
You're perfect, Abigail.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.741
You're the most ethical teacher
in this school.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.827
Stay that way,
don't let them take your sparkle.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.955
Well, who took yours?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.499
A sparkle pirate?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.172
Mr. Hayward,
if you don't stop eating my stone fruit,

10:31.255 --> 10:33.257
I will tell Gertrude I know where you are.

10:41.932 --> 10:45.561
[sighs] Abby, I appreciate
you volunteering to grade my kids' finals.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.815
Aw, thank you for the chance
to proctor your kids' oral exams.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.816
[Ray] Ah.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.568
Gabriel must be growing up.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.071
When he was my student
and I said that word,

10:55.154 --> 10:56.906
he would repeat it and snicker.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.200
[Abby laughs]

11:00.076 --> 11:02.078
Proctor is a funny word.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.083
Heh. Uh, Abby, I just wanted
to go over a few things with you.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.418
A little housekeeping.
Nothing big, but, uh...

11:09.794 --> 11:11.212
all my students need to pass.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.547
Well, they'll pass if they pass.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.635
And you know what'd even be more fun,
is if they pass even if they fail.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.513
How does that work?

11:20.930 --> 11:24.892
Abby, what do you think happens
to those kids who can't come back here?

11:25.101 --> 11:28.020
Hmm. They go to a more appropriate school

11:28.104 --> 11:31.357
with smaller class sizes
and more personal attention?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.402
Yeah, they go to unicorn-iversity.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.404
[sighs]

11:36.487 --> 11:39.115
Things don't get better for the students.
They actually get worse.

11:39.407 --> 11:43.244
They get sent to CCC.
That's the California Continuation Center.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.580
You know, the gray building
with no windows, barbed wire?

11:46.664 --> 11:47.790
By the train tracks.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.251
-Oh, you mean the prison.
-Yeah.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.797
That's CCC, aka Alcatraz High.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.968
Yeah, where students' dreams go to die.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.554
Abby, look, you have a big heart,

12:01.637 --> 12:03.931
and some of my students
might need you to grade with it.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.349
But that would be wrong.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.185
This isn't South Dakota
where life is so black and white.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.146
And I'm guessing mostly white.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.651
Hey!

12:16.277 --> 12:19.655
My town has
a very vibrant African-American community.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.158
-Mm-hmm?
-The Hendersons live on Third Street.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.576
Yeah.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.661
So, are they still on Third Street?

12:25.786 --> 12:28.539
Ah! I was wondering if you knew them.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.921
Abby, when you've been around
as long as I have,

12:36.005 --> 12:39.675
you'll come to understand
that life is full of gray areas.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.552
In case some of my kids struggle,

12:41.635 --> 12:45.639
I'm just saying, sometimes a little wrong
might lead to a greater right.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.517
Oh, I don't know, Gabe.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.644
That kind of thinking can be
a slippery slope.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.105
Ah, that's my favorite kind of slope.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.107
[chuckles] Whee!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.610
[both laugh]

13:01.447 --> 13:06.494
Oh, my God, that iceberg lettuce
with no dressing looks awesome!

13:09.288 --> 13:10.289
F this.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.960
-Scooch over.
-No, thank you.

13:15.044 --> 13:15.961
Okay.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.298
[cell phone chimes]

13:20.132 --> 13:22.301
You know, I don't know
what's gotten into Danny lately.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.220
-He's been very lovey-dovey.
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.098
Oh, he doesn't usually say
things like this.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.601
You know, Abby, this is kind of "me" time.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.603
[cell phone chimes]

13:33.771 --> 13:35.773
Five eggplant emojis.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.691
He must be hungry. [chuckles]

13:39.652 --> 13:41.821
He not hungry, he thirsty.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.532
[cell phone chimes]

13:45.449 --> 13:48.744
Now he wants to do "peach emoji stuff."

13:49.745 --> 13:50.830
They always do.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.457
Send him a stoplight emoji.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.918
And then, three cats and a lollipop.

13:59.129 --> 14:02.174
No, he's allergic to cats.
How about just a happy face?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.300
[cell phone chimes]

14:04.844 --> 14:05.803
Wait a minute,

14:06.220 --> 14:08.681
why is he sending me pictures of breasts?

14:08.764 --> 14:10.641
Uh-oh, Abby, give me your phone.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.894
Okay, you've gotten added
to a text chain by mistake.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.437
Who the hell is Lindsay?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.774
Oh, Lindsay's my friend from Bible camp.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
Oh, Lord Jesus, help me.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.700
But why is she sending me pictures
of her breasts?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.161
[gasps] Do you think she has a lump
and she's worried?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.623
Abby, your man is creeping.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
The only lump is in his pants.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.794
My gosh.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.462
What?

14:40.588 --> 14:44.049
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,
but what did you expect?

14:44.341 --> 14:46.218
You know, there are only two types of men:

14:46.302 --> 14:49.013
those who cheat,
and those who haven't been caught yet.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.264
[cell phone chimes]

14:50.347 --> 14:53.601
-Oh, God, my back's locking up.
-Oh, that's just stress.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.061
Do not give that fool all your power.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.479
[cell phone chimes]

14:57.938 --> 15:00.065
Wow, that is a big penis.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.532
All right, everyone,
it is time for your presentations,

15:08.616 --> 15:12.912
so let's get ready to not mumble!

15:14.121 --> 15:16.957
Hey, real quick, before you head out
into the hallway to wait your turn,

15:17.041 --> 15:18.792
there's been a last-second change.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.295
Um, Ms. Spencer's gonna be grading you.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.048
Ooh! My ginger sister from another mister.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.262
Yo,
last-second changes are always bad news.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.597
Like when Jackie O said,

15:31.680 --> 15:35.100
"Oh, it's such a sunny day out.
Let's not take the bulletproof car."

15:36.226 --> 15:38.771
[chuckles] Relax, Lorenzo.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.898
This is actually
a good last-second change.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.360
Uh, kinda like when they gave the Oscar
to Moonlight instead of La La Land.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.111
Uh-huh.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.030
Come on. A white guy saving jazz.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.660
Anyway, if there's any one person
at this school who's nicer than me,

15:52.743 --> 15:53.869
it's Ms. Spencer.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.372
[door slams]

15:56.747 --> 15:58.874
All right. Let's get this over with.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.589
And that's why, to honor Cesar Chavez
and Dolores Huerta,

16:05.673 --> 16:07.967
the leaders
of the United Farm Workers movement,

16:08.050 --> 16:10.719
I still won't eat grapes.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.390
Sí, se puede.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.601
Yes, you can. And...

16:18.352 --> 16:19.436
yes, you did.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.690
Great job, Marisol.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.983
So promising.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.027
I hope a man never dims your light.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.530
Okay.

16:30.447 --> 16:34.618
Well, speaking of dim lights,
have you ever considered solar panels?

16:38.247 --> 16:42.084
I rent. A two bedroom
that's far too big for me now.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.463
Overshare. All right.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.675
All right, well, I'm outta here.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.136
Um, Ms. Spencer, see you in the fall.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.014
Mr. Iglesias,
see you at the drive-through.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.688
[computer] The B in Susan B. Anthony
stands for "Brownell,"

17:02.771 --> 17:04.440
but it should stand for "boss."

17:04.523 --> 17:07.484
Yeah! Boo-yah! [laughs]

17:09.653 --> 17:10.779
Good job.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.535
So, in conclusion, lone gunman?

17:16.827 --> 17:17.911
You tell me.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.123
You. Tell. Me!

17:30.799 --> 17:32.051
Dude, it was crazy.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.762
'Cause Custer was all like,
[scoffs] "We got this,"

17:34.845 --> 17:36.972
and Sitting Bull was like,
"Go ahead, brah.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.391
I'm literally sitting here
waiting for you."

17:40.976 --> 17:43.854
But you mess with the bull,
you're gonna get the horns.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.815
And they did mess with the Bull,
and they did get the horns.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.442
Goodnight, Long Beach!

17:51.153 --> 17:52.321
See what he did there?

17:52.446 --> 17:56.700
He took historical content,
and he put it into a modern language.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.455
You are clutch, brah.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.958
Game recognizes game.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.590
What's the matter, Abby? You okay?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.550
My back is killing me.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.220
[sighs] How many more kids are there?

18:16.303 --> 18:19.515
Uh, just Mikey. He's my closer.
Let me just tell you right now,

18:19.598 --> 18:22.559
this kid knows more about Abraham Lincoln
than Mary Todd.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.520
That's who Lincoln was married to.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.647
I know, Gabe, I'm a history teacher.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.024
And I'm sure the Lincolns were very happy.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.819
Not the word that comes to mind.

18:33.070 --> 18:33.946
Whoo!

18:34.071 --> 18:37.616
Hope you enjoyed the warm-up acts
because the headliner is here.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.875
Hey, Abby? Abby,
seventh-inning stretch is over. Come on.

18:49.002 --> 18:49.878
[groans]

18:54.383 --> 18:55.676
All right, Mikey, let's do this.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.596
[stammers] Do what?

19:03.892 --> 19:04.977
Your oral report.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.020
Uh...

19:07.896 --> 19:09.273
You okay, buddy?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.276
She just did the whole sexy teacher thing

19:12.359 --> 19:14.194
with her hair, and glasses,
and everything.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.531
Okay. Focus, okay? Eyes on the prize.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.950
Not-- Not-- Not that prize.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.829
Look, you got this.
Lights, camera, knowledge, go.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.624
Uh... uh...

19:27.791 --> 19:30.502
Abraham Lincoln suffered a lot of loss
in his life.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.214
His son Willy died...
[voice cracks] ...in the White House...

19:34.298 --> 19:35.549
[groans]

19:36.049 --> 19:39.052
[breathing heavily] Um... The--
The lead singer of Linkin Park also died.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.473
Matthew McConaughey,
that's who drives a Lincoln.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.351
Time out. Time out. Come on.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.812
Come on. Dude, dude. Dude. Relax, okay?

19:48.896 --> 19:52.024
You need to take everything that's up here
and make it come out here.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.525
Okay? And listen.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.111
Forget about what's happening down here.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.786
[exhales] Uh...

20:05.495 --> 20:06.330
Log cabin.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.583
Kentucky? [scoffs]

20:10.000 --> 20:13.295
Abraham Simpson,
the 16th president of the United Nations.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.924
Oh, God, I'm going to CCC.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.428
-Mikey! Mikey! [sighs]
-[door opens]

20:21.845 --> 20:24.139
Abby, look, Mikey knows his stuff,
it's just...

20:24.389 --> 20:25.432
[stammers]

20:25.515 --> 20:28.727
Like Abraham Lincoln,
he died during a performance.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.651
Abby, Abby, wait. Abby! Abby!

20:35.734 --> 20:37.653
Look, I-- I know Mikey messed up, but...

20:37.736 --> 20:39.821
remember when I was asking you
to grade from the heart?

20:40.364 --> 20:41.490
Oh, Gabe.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.494
You don't want me grading from my cold,
dead heart today.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.289
Look, you can't send Mikey
to Alcatraz High.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.749
They'll use him as a shiv!

20:52.417 --> 20:54.878
Don't worry. I can lie.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.256
Men do it all the time.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.259
And now women can too.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.053
Equality, am I right?

21:09.017 --> 21:12.145
[clears throat]

21:16.275 --> 21:17.526
Read 'em and weep.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.778
[chuckles]

21:19.945 --> 21:23.365
I wanna record the look on your face
when you see that...

21:32.249 --> 21:33.875
Makes sense, all right.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.712
Grace, 87. Weirdo, but that sounds right.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.965
Walt, 75, perfectly average.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.426
Mikey, 85!

21:42.926 --> 21:44.678
-Hmm?
-[Carlos] Seriously?

21:45.178 --> 21:47.347
That kid's IQ isn't 85.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.226
I'm sorry, I can't do this. [panting]

21:51.476 --> 21:53.478
Abby, you're white. You can do anything.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.401
[sniffles]

22:02.654 --> 22:06.491
I cheated! I don't have integrity,

22:15.250 --> 22:17.252
I knew it. Mikey's dumb as dookie.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.173
I'm a cheater, just like Danny.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.592
No, you're not.
At least he tried to hide it.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.514
And believe me,
I know why she's gonna miss him.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.938
Well, I guess Mikey Gutierrez
is CCC's problem now.

22:37.022 --> 22:37.939
[sighs]

22:38.023 --> 22:40.400
Look on the bright side,
you'll still be able to say hi to him

22:40.484 --> 22:42.444
when you take your VW to get washed...

22:43.028 --> 22:44.279
once a semester.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.116
That's right, I'm the one who wrote,
"Wash me." A-boom!

22:49.701 --> 22:51.620
Gabe, you should be proud of yourself.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.622
You passed 95% of your kids.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.375
I know, but they all deserve to pass.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.211
Look, Mikey knows his stuff,
he was just... uh...

22:59.294 --> 23:01.171
distracted.
It didn't come out of his mouth.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.923
Well, whose fault is that?

23:03.423 --> 23:04.257
[grunts]

23:07.344 --> 23:09.888
'Cause she was honest enough
to admit that she cheated?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.098
No, look at her.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.850
Now, look at her through the eyes
of a 15-year-old.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.479
Oh. Mrs. Hendrix.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.606
Tenth grade teacher.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.233
Drove me crazy.

23:22.317 --> 23:25.153
Big nose, the smallest lips. [chuckles]

Long arms.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.954
Huh. Sounds like a handsome woman.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.791
And a shot blocker.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.630
Look, Mikey was distracted. 
Just give him another chance.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.800
Okay. Just so no one can say
that he failed for any other reason

23:46.883 --> 23:48.552
besides the fact
that he's not very bright,

23:49.052 --> 23:51.471
we'll grant him a retest,
which I will oversee.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.473
That's great. You won't regret this.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.892
Actually, you're rooting against him.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.644
You will totally regret this.

23:59.855 --> 24:00.772
A-boom!

24:05.026 --> 24:06.820
Hey, Mikey. I need to talk to you.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.698
[sighs]
Sorry I let you down, Mr. Iglesias.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.032
You didn't let me down.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.826
You know,
you were right about Linkin Park,

24:12.909 --> 24:15.287
and Matthew McConaughey
does drive a Lincoln.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.872
I just need you to build on that

24:16.955 --> 24:19.541
and find a way to apply it
to Abraham Lincoln.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.377
-What are you talking about?
-[Gabe] I got you a retest.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.047
Oh, it's okay, I-- I'm a legacy at CCC.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.592
My cousin Spider,
he said he'd have my back in the yard.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.639
Look, I need for you to do Hernandez
what I did to Mr. Chandler.

24:35.015 --> 24:35.891
Who's Mr. Chandler?

24:35.974 --> 24:38.268
A teacher who didn't think
I was good enough. [sighs]

24:38.351 --> 24:40.479
Man,
I just wanted to kick him in the nuts.

24:41.229 --> 24:44.232
-Did you?
-Sort of. By getting an A in his class.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.776
So, if I pass,

24:46.860 --> 24:48.778
it'll be like I'm kicking Hernandez
in the nuts.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.031
Exactly. So kick hard.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.075
-Let's do this.
-Come on.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.787
"To achieve and cherish
a just and lasting peace,

24:57.871 --> 25:00.332
among ourselves and with all nations."

25:00.582 --> 25:02.167
Gabe, I can't see.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.880
And if you can't see him,
he can't see you.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.385
And thus concludes Abraham Lincoln's
second inaugural address.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.346
[chuckles] Yeah, right in the huevos.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.351
Nicely done, Mr. Gutierrez.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.019
You know what? I did cheat.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.438
I cheated this kid
out of an extra ten points.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.814
He deserves a 95.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.985
For rote memorization? A 70 at best.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.321
[scoffs] Excuse me, I'm not done.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.949
Uh-- Uh, 70's good, 70 is good.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.993
Seventy is good. He's, you know--
He could be done.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.996
-When Abraham Lincoln was a young man...
-He's not done.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.917
...he said,
"Someday, I shall be president."

25:44.042 --> 25:46.336
Dear God,
I hope he doesn't wanna be president.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.589
He'd be a big improvement.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.387
And I have a teacher who helps me believe

25:55.470 --> 25:57.681
that I can grow up to be
whatever I wanna be.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.683
And if you have one person
who believes in you,

25:59.766 --> 26:01.393
that's enough to have success.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.061
Why? Because you don't wanna
disappoint them.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.398
He's talking about me.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.237
You know, Lincoln also said,
"Whatever you are, you be a good one."

26:12.821 --> 26:14.489
Well, right now,
I'm a Wilson High student,

26:14.573 --> 26:15.865
and I'm trying to be a good one.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.620
And you can keep trying in the fall.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.663
[exhales]

26:22.831 --> 26:23.790
Damn it!

26:26.251 --> 26:28.378
You live to fight another day,
Mr. Iglesias,

26:28.461 --> 26:31.923
but I will make this an elite 100 school
by any means necessary.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.550
I know that quote.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.468
Civil rights activist Malcolm Ten.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.888
What?

26:41.641 --> 26:42.976
Wakanda forever.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.443
[chuckles]

26:51.526 --> 26:54.988
You guys,
I was so inspired by Mikey today,

26:55.363 --> 26:56.489
I've been wondering...

26:56.906 --> 26:58.867
does Danny deserve a second chance too?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.118
[all] No.

27:02.912 --> 27:03.872
Really?

27:04.539 --> 27:06.958
-No.
-[Paula] Uh-uh.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.337
-Thanks, Katie. Abby, you gotta move on.
-[Katie] Mm-hmm.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.674
You know, the best way to get over someone
is to get under someone else.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.178
Who said that? Was that Maya Angelou?

27:20.055 --> 27:24.017
Nope. Someone just as wise:
MC Humpty Hump. Hm.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.438
Hey,
there's lot to be said for rebound sex.

27:28.688 --> 27:29.898
[laughs]

27:29.981 --> 27:32.692
And I'm guessing a guy your size
doesn't get a lot of rebounds.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.695
You'd be surprised
how many boards I grab after last call.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.364
[laughs]

27:38.073 --> 27:39.783
Abby, stick with me.
I'll take care of you.

27:40.367 --> 27:44.162
Really? I could use the guidance
of a strong, mature woman.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.122
Okay. Lesson number one:

27:46.498 --> 27:48.958
Even Cicely Tyson doesn't like
to be called mature.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.753
-[mouthing silently]
-[Paula] This is what we'll do.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.838
You tell me where Lindsay works,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.132
and we'll send those titty pics
to her boss.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.968
Then, we get the last four of her social.

27:59.135 --> 28:02.055
There are 500 ways
I could ruin that ho's life. 

28:02.889 --> 28:03.932
I got you, girl.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.809
[both chuckle]

28:06.309 --> 28:08.478
-Hey, man, somebody better call Danny.
-Yep.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.443
