THEY TURNED YOU DOWN

00:30.560 --> 00:32.198
FOR A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN
LAST YEAR?

00:32.230 --> 00:34.289
YES, BECAUSE THEY TURNED ME
DOWN FOR A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN.

09:12.650 --> 09:13.947
YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN WORRY.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.914
SO IT WOULD GO
A LONG WAY

09:15.950 --> 09:20.353
IF YOU LET ME SEND YOU GUYS
SOME FOOD IN THERE.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.982
YOU LIKE PIZZA?

09:26.230 --> 09:27.754
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

09:27.800 --> 09:28.949
HOW PROTOCOL WORKS,

09:29.000 --> 09:29.921
AND YOU
MAY HAVE GOTTEN GUSTER

09:29.970 --> 09:31.221
IN REAL TROUBLE
IN THERE

09:31.270 --> 09:32.328
DIALING HIS
CELL PHONE.

09:32.370 --> 09:33.689
AT LEAST
I DID SOMETHING.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.798
LOOK, SHAWN.
HE IS SWAT.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.829
AND HE IS GOOD
AT WHAT HE DOES.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.599
I AM FINE
WITH BACKING OFF HERE.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.732
HE'S SWAT!

09:38.770 --> 09:40.078
HE'S SWAT.
THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT?

09:40.110 --> 09:41.975
HE'S NOT COLIN FARRELL.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.944
I GET THAT YOU
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GUS,

09:43.980 --> 09:48.076
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
HE IS IN CAPABLE HANDS.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.883
THERE'S A WOMAN
OVER THERE THAT SAYS

09:49.920 --> 09:51.785
HER FIANCE HAS DIABETES.
HE'S INSIDE.

09:51.820 --> 09:52.912
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.814
I GET WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.918
YOU DO?

09:55.960 --> 09:56.927
YES, I DO.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.326
I'M SENSING
A RELATIONSHIP HERE.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.395
YOU ARE?

10:00.430 --> 10:01.692
YES.
YOU AND LUNTZ.

10:01.730 --> 10:02.992
THERE'S A FAMILIAL
THING HAPPENING.

10:03.030 --> 10:03.962
HE'S LIKE
AN OLDER UNCLE.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.797
WHAT ARE YOU,
RELATED TO HIM?

10:05.830 --> 10:06.831
NOT YET.
LASSITER.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.929
WHAT? HE'S PSYCHIC.
SHOULDN'T HE KNOW ALREADY?

10:08.970 --> 10:09.959
KNOW WHAT?
WHAT IS HE GETTING AT?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.034
IT'S NOTHING.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.935
BUT I DO KNOW CAMERON.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.935
LUNTZ.
COMMANDER CAMERON LUNTZ.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.834
CAMERON?
YES.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.778
AND HE'S NOT MY UNCLE.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.698
I MET HIM
AT A POLICE DISTRICT CONFERENCE,

10:18.750 --> 10:19.774
HE ASKED ME OUT,

10:19.820 --> 10:20.809
WE WENT ON A FEW DATES.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.942
I LIKE HIM.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.982
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE DATING THIS GUY?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.647
DING, DING, DING.
TELL HIM WHAT HE WON O'HARA.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.422
LOOK, SHAWN.
I WAS--

10:30.460 --> 10:31.654
DON--DON'T WORRY.
IT'S FINE.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.920
JULES, REALLY.
DARE I SAY, DANDY?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.996
ISN'T THAT A WORD
FROM HIS GENERATION?

10:36.030 --> 10:36.997
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.099
AND LOOK,
I WAS GOING TO TALK

10:38.130 --> 10:39.392
TO YOU ABOUT IT EARLIER,
BUT--

10:39.430 --> 10:40.931
IT'S GREAT.
IT'S--IT'S REALLY GREAT.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.161
I'M SO...
SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.336
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

10:45.370 --> 10:47.076
I HAVE A BEST FRIEND
TO SAVE.

10:52.010 --> 10:55.309
CHIEF,
ELDER COMMANDING OFFICER LUNTZ,

10:55.350 --> 10:56.908
YOU NEED TO
LET ME GET INVOLVED HERE.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.042
YOU NEED TO LET ME
SCOPE THINGS OUT.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.387
(Vick)
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.308
YOU'RE NOT A TRAINED
TACTICAL OFFICER, SPENCER.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.681
ARE WE POSITIVE
HE'S EVEN HOUSE-TRAINED?

11:03.730 --> 11:04.981
[laughs]
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.827
MAYBE YOU AND I GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

11:06.860 --> 11:07.952
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE CORRECT.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.059
I HAVE HAD A FEW CLOSE CALLS
AROUND THE HOUSE RECENTLY,

11:10.100 --> 11:11.397
BUT I CAN HELP YOU.

11:11.430 --> 11:12.795
OH?
HOW'S THAT?

11:12.840 --> 11:13.829
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY,

11:13.870 --> 11:15.132
OTHER THAN HIS NAME?

11:15.170 --> 11:18.059
WE KNOW THAT HE'S A LONGTIME
CUSTOMER OF THIS BANK,

11:18.110 --> 11:21.307
OWED A HUGE LOAD
OF BACK TAXES TO THE IRS.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.103
HE'S JUST HAD HIS HOUSE
FORECLOSED ON.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.870
AND HE'S A MIDDLE CHILD.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.046
YOU KNOW HE'S A MIDDLE CHILD?

11:28.080 --> 11:29.479
I COULD HEAR IT
IN THE TIMBRE OF HIS VOICE,

11:29.520 --> 11:31.715
AND THE FACT THAT
HE DOESN'T USE CONTRACT IONS,

11:31.750 --> 11:32.956
YES.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.958
OKAY.
FINE.

11:34.990 --> 11:35.957
WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE BANK?

11:35.990 --> 11:37.924
LOOK, YOU SEND YOUR GUY
IN THERE, AND WHAT?

11:37.960 --> 11:39.120
MAYBE HE GETS YOU
A GUESSTIMATE

11:39.160 --> 11:40.127
OF HOW MANY HOSTAGES
THERE ARE?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.798
I CAN WALK INTO THAT BANK.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.491
I CAN PSYCHICALLY READ
EVERY SINGLE HOSTAGE

11:43.530 --> 11:45.225
AND STUBBINS.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.090
HE'S FREAKED OUT.
HE WON'T TALK TO YOU.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.961
HE DOESN'T NEED TO,
I CAN READ HIS MIND.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.932
CAN YOU READ
MY MIND RIGHT NOW?

11:51.970 --> 11:53.972
'CAUSE IT'S SENDING
A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE

11:54.010 --> 11:55.898
WHERE I WANT YOU TO BE.

11:58.110 --> 11:59.975
[phone ringing]

12:00.020 --> 12:02.341
SIR.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.018
LUNTZ HERE.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.984
(Phil)
DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

12:06.020 --> 12:06.987
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:07.020 --> 12:07.987
I CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.159
YOU ARE SENDING A COP
IN HERE WITH THE PIZZAS.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.851
LOOK, PHIL.
CALM DOWN NOW.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.050
THAT'S JUST FOR EVERYBODY'S
SAFETY, THAT'S ALL.

12:13.100 --> 12:13.998
WELL, IT IS NOT
HAPPENING.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.998
I'LL BRING THEM UP THERE MYSELF,
IF YOU LIKE.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.099
I DO NOT THINK SO.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.995
YOU WILL SEND IN
A REGULAR PERSON.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.031
REGULAR PERSON?

12:20.070 --> 12:22.038
YES.
A REGULAR PERSON.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.538
YOU WILL SEND IN SOMEONE
FROM BEHIND THOSE BARRICADES.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.879
A REGULAR PERSON.
NOT A COP.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.027
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

12:51.830 --> 12:53.331
I WOULDN'T ACCEPT THESE
IF I WERE YOU.

12:53.370 --> 12:54.530
SPENCER.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.561
JUST PUT THE PIZZAS
DOWN AND WALK AWAY.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.033
GET OUTTA THERE.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.037
EIGHT PIES,

12:59.070 --> 13:00.332
FOUR OF THEM ARE VEGETABLE.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.405
IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?

13:02.440 --> 13:03.998
NO PEPPERONI?
REALLY?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.540
PLUS THE BLATANT DISREGARD

13:05.580 --> 13:07.468
AND UTTER CRIMINAL LACK
OF HAM AND PINEAPPLE.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.976
SPENCER!

13:09.020 --> 13:10.487
WHAT KIND OF GOOD FAITH
NEGOTIATION, IS THIS?

13:10.520 --> 13:13.318
I MEAN, THIS IS
A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.452
WELL, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY

13:14.490 --> 13:15.809
WITH THE INGREDIENTS!

13:15.860 --> 13:18.385
PUT THE PIZZAS DOWN
AND WALK AWAY!

13:18.430 --> 13:20.489
I WON'T LET YOU ACCEPT THESE.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.964
WALK AWAY.
THIS IS MY OPERATION.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.922
GO GET HIM.
GO GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.995
HE'S NOT GOING
TO ACCEPT THESE--AAH!

13:27.040 --> 13:28.530
[screams]

13:30.540 --> 13:31.962
FAN OUT, FAN OUT, FAN OUT!

13:32.010 --> 13:33.830
SPENCER!

13:33.880 --> 13:37.600
[men Shouting]

13:37.650 --> 13:39.049
TERRIFIC.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.514
PUT THOSE PIZZAS DOWN
RIGHT OVER THERE.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.088
ALL RIGHT, PHIL.

13:52.130 --> 13:54.451
I'M JUST AS MAD
ABOUT THIS AS YOU ARE.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.990
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
GO OUT THERE

13:56.030 --> 13:57.292
AND MAKE THIS RIGHT?

13:57.330 --> 13:58.422
AND ON THE WAY BACK IN,

13:58.470 --> 13:59.425
I'LL HAVE THEM THROW IN
A COUPLE LITERS

13:59.470 --> 14:02.564
OF OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER
AND SOME CINNA-STARS.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.306
THEY'RE LIKE CINNA-DOTS,
THEY'RE JUST--THEY'RE POINTY.

14:04.340 --> 14:05.864
THEY'RE GOOD.
THEY'RE NOT GREAT.

14:05.910 --> 14:06.899
BUT I CAN GET THEM,

14:06.940 --> 14:08.032
FREE OF CHARGE.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.536
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.242
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

14:12.280 --> 14:25.978
YOU'VE JUST BECOME
MY NEXT HOSTAGE.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.249
(Gus)
WHY DOES HE KEEP
SEPARATING EVERYBODY?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.598
JULES IS DATING
AN OLD SWAT GUY?

14:31.630 --> 14:33.564
WE'RE IN A HOSTAGE SITUATION,
SHAWN.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.965
YOU DON'T GET THAT?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.137
I DO GET IT.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.001
WHAT I DON'T GET IS
THE BULLETPROOF VEST

14:38.040 --> 14:39.064
OVER THE SHIRT.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.429
WHAT IS THAT?
I'M TELLING YOU.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.072
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
WITH THIS GUY.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.146
AND THEN HE MAKES US
TAKE OUR SHOES OFF?

14:44.180 --> 14:45.272
WHO DOES THAT?

14:45.310 --> 14:46.379
WHY?

14:46.410 --> 14:48.048
IT'S A WAY
OF CONTAINING PEOPLE.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.184
YOU KNOW, SLOWING THEM DOWN
AND WHATNOT.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.279
SO WE CAN'T RUN AWAY
WHEN HE STARTS SHOOTING US.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.083
HE'S GOING TO START
KILLING US OFF,

14:54.120 --> 14:54.950
ON E-BY-ONE.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.218
OH, MY GOD.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.158
WOULD YOU PLEASE RELAX?

14:57.190 --> 14:59.283
CLEARLY, I HAVE A HANDLE
ON THE SITUATION.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.558
A HANDLE?
A HANDLE!

15:00.600 --> 15:01.555
YOU MOUTHED OFF TO HIM

15:01.600 --> 15:03.124
AND GOT YOURSELF
TAKEN HOSTAGE.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.194
OF COURSE I DID.

15:04.230 --> 15:05.219
THAT WAS MY PLAN
ALL ALONG,

15:05.270 --> 15:07.033
YOU SWEET DOLLOP
OF SPICY GOODNESS.

15:07.070 --> 15:07.889
I HAD TO GET
MYSELF IN THERE,

15:07.940 --> 15:10.158
SO I COULD SEE
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.200
AND I HAVE THIS FEELING
THAT WE ARE NOT DEALING

15:16.240 --> 15:17.468
WITH THE PERSON
THEY THINK WE ARE.

15:17.510 --> 15:20.172
WHY WOULD A BANK ROBBER
KEEP HIS GUN SAFETY ON?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.984
SO HELP ME OUT.
THINK.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.248
WHAT DO YOU
REMEMBER SEEING

15:24.290 --> 15:27.009
THE MOMENT THAT
THE ROBBERY WENT DOWN?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.016
FEATURES?
NOSES?

15:29.060 --> 15:30.129
MAYBE A CHIN.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.422
I DID SEE A CHIN.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.519
A BEAUTIFUL ONE.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.295
A GLORIOUS ONE.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.230
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
SHE'S OVER A HUNDRED.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.067
ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

15:42.100 --> 15:43.032
NOT HER, SHAWN.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.662
OH.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.029
I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO THINK IN HERE, SHAWN.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.301
AND I'VE REALIZED
SOME THINGS ABOUT LIFE.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.103
IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.141
YES. BUT TWO HOURS
"HOSTAGE" TIME.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.149
THINGS HAPPEN FAST
IN HERE SHAWN.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.081
LIFE IS FLEETING,
AND I NEED TO LIVE IT.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.758
I NEED TO SAY
THE THINGS I'M FEELING,

16:00.790 --> 16:02.280
AND ACT ON
THOSE FEELINGS

16:02.320 --> 16:03.355
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.029
AND S0 DO YOU.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.597
OKAY.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.427
IN OTHER NEWS, PHIL.
PHIL!

16:10.470 --> 16:12.426
(Gus)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:12.470 --> 16:14.028
YOU WANT TO GET
YOURSELF SHOT?

16:14.070 --> 16:15.059
WHAT?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.067
SORRY.
NOTHING.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.135
OUR BAD.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.660
YOU JUST GO BACK
TO YOUR WHOLE

16:18.710 --> 16:20.177
"ROBBERING" THING.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.030
I NEED TO POTTY.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.547
I-I-I'M-I'M SORRY.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.309
I'M SORRY, EVERYONE.

16:25.350 --> 16:26.442
I DOWNED AN ORANGE JULIUS

16:26.480 --> 16:28.175
RIGHT BEFORE
I WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.085
AND IT--
IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.718
I NEED TO POTTY.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.079
LOOK--
I KNOW MY BODY.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.156
AND I KNOW
MY STOMACH.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.055
AND THIS COULD GET
REALLY UGLY.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.729
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.159
ALL RIGHT, DON'T ANYBODY MOVE.
I'M WATCHING YOU.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.269
I'M JUST GOING
TO BE RIGHT HERE.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.188
DON'T MOVE.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.096
YOU KNOW I'M NOT
REALLY A REGULAR PERSON.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.108
RIGHT, PHIL?

16:51.140 --> 16:53.176
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:53.210 --> 16:54.279
IT MEANS I TRIED ONCE
AND FAILED.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.403
I'M JUST TOO UNIQUE
AND INTERESTING.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.499
THE FRENCH CALL IT
DU FROMAGE.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.644
WHICH LOOSELY TRANSLATED
MEANS "OF CHEESE."

17:01.680 --> 17:03.716
THE TRUTH IS,
I'M ACTUALLY A PSYCHIC.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.411
A PROFESSIONAL ONE.

17:05.450 --> 17:08.157
AND I AM GETTING
A MAJOR READING.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.350
RIGHT IN HERE.

17:09.390 --> 17:10.357

17:10.390 --> 17:11.652
[inhale]
THERE IT GOES AGAIN.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.157
WHAT?
WHAT'S IT SAYING?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.054
IT'S SAYING THAT YOU ARE
A MIDDLE CHILD.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.092
YES, YES I AM.

17:18.130 --> 17:21.236
IT IS ALSO SAYING
THAT YOU ARE NOT...

17:21.270 --> 17:23.500
[whispering]
A BANK ROBBER.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.435
YOU KNOW THIS?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.209
YES.
VERY MUCH SO.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.241
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
AT PLAY HERE, PHIL.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.372
SOMETHING NEFARIOUS.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.672
AND ALSO EVIL.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.381
OH, GOD, YES.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.183
[sighs]
YOU DO KNOW.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.016
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.153
I CAN'T KEEP UP
THIS RUSE ANY LONGER.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.259
PLEASE.
HOW'S MY WIFE?

17:44.290 --> 17:45.689
YOUR WIFE?
YEAH, IS SHE SCARED?

17:45.730 --> 17:46.788
IS SHE SCARED?

17:46.830 --> 17:50.266
UH. . .YES,
SHE IS SCARED.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.518
OH, MY GOD.
JOANNA, I'M SO SORRY.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.435
CAN YOU GET A MESSAGE
TO HER?

17:57.170 --> 17:59.229
YES, I BELIEVE I CAN.

17:59.270 --> 18:01.204
JOAN NA.
JOAN NA.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.832
LISTEN, JOANNA.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.279
THIS MORNING
I WAS CONFRONTED BY A MAN,

18:04.310 --> 18:05.402
I DON'T KNOW WHO.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.611
AND HE TOLD ME
THAT HE HAD KIDNAPPED YOU

18:07.650 --> 18:08.844
AND WAS HOLDING
YOU SOMEWHERE.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.518
AND IF I DIDN'T WALK
INTO THIS BANK RIGHT THEN

18:10.550 --> 18:11.414
AND GET HIM THESE DIAMONDS

18:11.450 --> 18:13.418
AND DROP THEM
IN A MAILBOX DOWN THE ROAD,

18:13.460 --> 18:16.258
HE WAS GOING
TO KILL YOU.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.848
AND I SCREWED UP.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.482
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET OUT OF THIS, HONEY.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.259
I'M SO SORRY.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.822
OH, WOW.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.191
PHIL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.334
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST
REALLY JAM-PACKED

18:28.370 --> 18:29.769
WITH, UH,
INFORMATION.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.358
IT WAS ALSO
A LITTLE BREATHY.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.661
ODDLY SOOTHING.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.234
SHE SAID NOT TO WORRY.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.269
EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

18:35.310 --> 18:36.538
BUT HOW?

18:36.580 --> 18:37.706
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

18:37.750 --> 18:39.445
OKAY, YEAH.
BUT HOW?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.619
I MEAN, I FEEL
LIKE I'M BEING WATCHED.

18:41.650 --> 18:45.108
BY THE COPS,
BY SOMEONE IN HERE.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.188
PHIL, I WILL HELP YOU.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.585
BUT YOU HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.224
I'M WORKING
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.229
I KNOW WHO ALL THE PLAYERS
ARE OUT THERE.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.228
I WILL GET YOU
OUT OF THIS BANK.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.262
AND I WILL FIND OUT
WHERE YOUR WIFE IS.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.838
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET ME
LEAD THIS NEGOTIATION.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.430
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

19:04.470 --> 19:05.539
I THINK SO.

19:05.570 --> 19:06.901
OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN...

19:06.940 --> 19:09.204
FIRST, KEEP UP
THE CRAZY GUY ROUTINE.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.446
WE NEED THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.209
BUT DO NOT SPEAK
TO ANYONE HERE

19:12.250 --> 19:13.319
UNLESS I AM WITH YOU.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.544
SECONDLY. ..

19:14.580 --> 19:16.912
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE ME SOME PRIVACY.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.384
I WASN'T KIDDING
ABOUT THE ORANGE JULIUS.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.321
OH.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.296

19:29.960 --> 19:31.393

19:32.670 --> 19:34.490

SOMEONE--

19:34.540 --> 19:35.734
LOOK, SPENCER.

19:35.770 --> 19:36.964
THE FIRST THING YOU
GOTTA REALIZE

19:37.000 --> 19:38.729
ABOUT TH ESE GUYS
IS THAT THEY WILL TRY

19:38.770 --> 19:39.907
TO MANIPULATE
ANYBODY THEY CAN

19:39.940 --> 19:41.237
TO GET OUT OF THERE ALIVE.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.679
I THINK THAT
YOU HAVE INTERFERED

19:42.710 --> 19:44.473
AND SCREWED UP ENOUGH,
DON'T YOU?

19:44.510 --> 19:45.647
WHY DON'T YOU FIND YOURSELF

19:45.680 --> 19:47.409
A QUIET LITTLE CORNER
IN THERE

19:47.450 --> 19:49.338
AND LAY LOW, COPY?

19:49.380 --> 19:50.347
I-I'M TELL--

19:50.390 --> 19:51.709

19:59.330 --> 20:01.195
FRONT AND CENTER
ON THIS CASE.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.264
I'M LISTENING.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.892
STUBBINS ISN'T BEHIND
THE ROBBERY.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.989
SOMEBODY KIDNAPPED HIS WIFE
AND PUT HIM UP TO IT.

20:07.030 --> 20:09.635
SPENCER, YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS
A LITTLE NUTSY, RIGHT?

20:09.670 --> 20:10.432
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

20:10.470 --> 20:11.630
JUST SEND A COUPLE
BLACK AND WHITES

20:11.670 --> 20:12.637
OUT TO LOOK FOR THE WIFE

20:12.670 --> 20:13.739
AND SEE WHAT BLOWS BACK.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.270
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
THAT SH--

20:15.310 --> 20:17.346
[toilet flushes]
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?

20:17.380 --> 20:19.575

TO SEND YOU OUT ON.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.018
OKAY.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.984
(Phil)
WHAT ARE WE DOING
IN THE BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE?

20:33.030 --> 20:34.497
I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY

20:43.910 --> 20:46.401
"MY DEMANDS...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.670
AN AIRPLANE TO TAKE ME

20:54.080 --> 20:56.446
THAT'S NON-NEGOTIABLE.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.448
$5,000
IN UNMARKED BILLS.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.388
THIS IS A HUGE LIST.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.148
WHAT IF THEY WON'T GIVE ME
ANY OF THIS STUFF?

21:00.190 --> 21:02.556
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO,
PHIL.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.353
THAT'S JUST TO BUY US TIME.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.220
SO THAT WE
CAN FIGURE OUT

21:05.260 --> 21:06.727
WHO IN HERE
HAS PUT YOU UP TO THIS.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.352
A ZIP LINE PULLEY SYSTEM

USED TO TRANSPORT DELICIOUSLY
FLAVORED SNACKS AND SUCH

21:11.570 --> 21:13.367
FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.230

21:14.270 --> 21:15.294
LOOK, JUST CALL OUT

21:15.340 --> 21:17.399
AND REMEMBER,
I NEED TO SPEAK TO HIM FIRST.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.471
[Shawn's voice echoing]
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY,

21:23.510 --> 21:25.478
OTHER THAN HIS NAME?

21:25.510 --> 21:27.375
[Luntz's voice echoing]
WE KNOW THAT
HIS HOUSE FORECLOSED ON.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.809
LUNTZ, IT'S PHIL.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.044
HEY THERE, FRIEND.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.012
I WAS WONDERING
WHY I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.950

THAT'S A MISTAKE.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.566
THIS IS BETWEEN
YOU AND ME--
HEY, CAM!

21:45.600 --> 21:46.965
IT'S SHAWN.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.331
[sighs]

21:48.370 --> 21:50.634
SPENCER, PUT STUBBINS

21:50.670 --> 21:52.968
EEEE.
THAT'S, UH...

21:53.010 --> 21:54.477
THAT'S GOING TO BE
A LITTLE AWKWARD, UH--

21:54.510 --> 21:55.670
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW TO PUT THIS.

21:55.710 --> 21:56.677
AND BEAR WITH ME,

21:56.710 --> 21:58.473
BECAUSE THIS IS
MY FIRST HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION,

22:00.520 --> 22:01.976
MAKING THE DEMANDS NOW.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.578

WOULD I DO THAT?

22:08.390 --> 22:09.379
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.682
ISN'T THE "TIMBRE"

22:10.730 --> 22:12.379
OF MY VOICE TELLING YOU WHY?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.367
IT'S SPENCER.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.234
SHAWN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:22.270 --> 22:25.034
JULES, HOW SERIOUS IS THIS THING

23:49.190 --> 23:50.555

23:50.590 --> 23:52.228
YOU THINK THAT
WAS ALL MY DECISION?

23:52.260 --> 23:54.524
I'M JUST A DUPE
FOR THE UPPER MANAGEMENT.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.755
I DON'T HAVE THE POWER
YOU THINK I DO.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.461
WE UNDERSTAND,
MR. GRESLING.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.968
BUT I'M STILL A LITTLE FUZZY
ON THE DETAILS.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.194
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING

24:02.240 --> 24:04.731
WHEN MR. STUBBINS CAME
TO THE BANK?

24:04.770 --> 24:06.169
I REMEMBER HIM
ENTERING THE BANK,

24:06.210 --> 24:08.098
AND HE APPROACHED ME.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.715
I WAS BUSY WITH A CUSTOMER,
BUT HE CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.

24:16.650 --> 24:17.548
HE ASKED ME

24:17.590 --> 24:18.818
TO TAKE HIM
TO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT,

24:18.850 --> 24:20.659
WHICH I DID.

24:20.690 --> 24:23.557
ONCE INSIDE THE VAULT,
HE DREW HIS GUN.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.595
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
HE KNEW ABOUT THE DIAMONDS?

24:29.630 --> 24:31.666
(Mr. Gresling)
THE DIAMONDS WERE DEPOSITED
IN THAT PARTICULAR BOX

24:31.700 --> 24:33.565
ONE WEEK PRIOR.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.898
I VERY DISTINCT LY
REMEMBER MR. STUBBINS

24:35.940 --> 24:37.669
BEING IN THE BANK
THAT DAY.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.009
HOW DO YOU DISTINCT LY
REMEMBER THAT?

24:41.040 --> 24:43.770
WELL, THE GENTLEMAN
WHO DEPOSITED THE DIAMONDS

24:43.810 --> 24:45.277
WAS A VERY
WEALTHY CUSTOMER

24:45.310 --> 24:47.847
WHO MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS
TO BE A V.I.P. CLIENT.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.211
OH.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.639
THEREFORE, I'M INSTRUCTED
TO TREAT HIM AS SUCH.

24:51.690 --> 24:52.486
RIGHT.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.081
MR. STUBBINS WAS
IN THE BANK BEFORE,

24:56.120 --> 24:57.929
TO GET TO HIS
SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX,

24:57.960 --> 24:58.949
BUT I SKIPPED HIM OVER.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.799
OH, THAT NEVER
FEELS GOOD.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.253
HE WAS VERY UPSET.
HE COMPLAINED.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.962
I FELT BAD FOR HIM,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.126
AND MAYBE THIS
WAS MY MISTAKE,

25:07.170 --> 25:08.159
BUT I TOLD HIM

25:08.200 --> 25:09.633
THAT THE GENTLEMAN
WAS DEPOSITING

25:09.670 --> 25:11.968
SOME VERY
VALUABLE MERCHANDISE.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.261
OH.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.835
THEREFORE HE KNEW
ABOUT THE DIAMONDS.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.576
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP, MAN.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

25:18.610 --> 25:20.578
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.110
GOD.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.111
NOTHING IS AGREEING
WITH ME TODAY.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.653
EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO, UH...

25:28.690 --> 25:31.227
TAKE CARE
OF SOME MORE BUSINESS.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.292
PHIL. BUDDY.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.602
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

25:43.640 --> 25:46.131
THEY'RE GOING TO MEET
ALL MY DEMANDS.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.774
SERIOUSLY?
EVEN THE PLAN E?

25:47.810 --> 25:48.629
YEAH.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.635
WHAT ABOUT THE SNACK LINE?

25:49.680 --> 25:51.045
YEAH.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.048
UM, THEY WANTED ME TO COME
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BUS.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.877
IT'S NOT BLUE.
IS THAT OKAY?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.342
YEAH.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.916
YOU HAVE A SHOT, TAKE IT.

26:07.090 --> 26:08.057
[gunshot]

26:09.100 --> 26:10.692
[hostages scream]

26:10.730 --> 26:12.266
THAT'S A NEGATIVE
ON THE TARGET, SIR.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.733
HOW DID YOU MISS?

26:13.770 --> 26:14.839
(sniper)
HE JUST FELL OUT OF MY SCOPE.

26:14.870 --> 26:16.189
VERY STRANGE.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.217
FREE HUGS.

26:29.250 --> 26:34.153
WHO'S NEXT?

26:34.190 --> 26:35.054
WELL, WE'RE STILL COMING
TO YOU

26:35.090 --> 26:36.682
FROM OUTSIDE
THE NATIONAL SAVINGS BANK

26:36.720 --> 26:38.927
WHERE THE HOSTAGE SITUATION
HAS ESCALATED.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.894
SHAWN SPENCER,

KIDDING ME.
AND IS NOT ONLY A HOSTAGE,

26:46.870 --> 26:48.861
(reporter)
HE APPEARS TO BE CALLING
THE SHOTS ON BEHALF

26:48.900 --> 26:49.798
OF THE NOW-NAMED ASSAILANT,

26:49.840 --> 26:51.933
PHILLIP STUBBINS.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.335
OH, THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.007
[groans]

26:59.050 --> 27:02.019
DUDE, DON'T EVEN SIT
BY ME RIGHT NOW.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.312
THEY ALREADY HATE ME
FOR THE PHONE THING.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.113
I DON'T NEED THEM TO KNOW
I'M FRIENDS WITH THE GUY

27:05.150 --> 27:06.913
THAT KEPT THEM
FROM BEING RESCUED.

27:06.950 --> 27:07.655
OKAY.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

27:07.690 --> 27:09.112
MAYBE,
BEFORE YOU ADMONISH ME

27:09.160 --> 27:10.309
WITH THAT TONE
OF VOICE,

27:10.360 --> 27:12.248
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR
MY INSANELY GOOD NEWS.

27:12.290 --> 27:13.655
WHAT?

27:13.700 --> 27:14.826
AS A SIGN
OF COOPERATION,

27:14.860 --> 27:16.794
PHIL AND I ARE GOING
TO RELEASE A HOSTAGE.

27:16.830 --> 27:17.797
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

27:17.830 --> 27:20.025
YES! YES, YES, YES,

27:20.070 --> 27:20.968
OKAY.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.865
I KNEW YOU WOULD GET ME
RELEASED. THANK YOU!

27:22.900 --> 27:24.299
W-W-WAIT, DUDE,
IT'S NOT YOU.

27:24.340 --> 27:25.364
WHAT?

27:25.410 --> 27:27.298
THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A MINUTE.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.776
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

27:30.810 --> 27:31.674
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.372
THERE'S OLDER PEOPLE HERE
AND--AND WOMEN.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.741

27:45.260 --> 27:46.955
GUS--
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

27:46.990 --> 27:47.991
I HAVE A HUNCH
ABOUT WHERE PHIL'S WIFE

27:48.030 --> 27:49.759
IS BEING HELD.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.097
I THINK IT'S DIRECTLY LINKED
TO A LIST

27:51.130 --> 27:52.324
OF FORECLOSED HOUSES
IN THE AREA,

27:52.370 --> 27:53.894
AND I HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.430
DON'T YOU SEE?
IT'S GOT TO BE ME.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.233
(Gus)
JUST FIGURE THIS OUT
AND GET ME OUT OF HERE

27:57.270 --> 27:58.430
BEFORE THERE'S
A RED LASER LIGHT

27:58.470 --> 27:59.869
SHINING ON MY FOREHEAD.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.071
AND BE CAREFUL, SHAWN.
I WILL, BUDDY.

28:02.110 --> 28:05.477
OH, AND SHAWN...

28:05.510 --> 28:06.943
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW...

28:06.980 --> 28:08.743

I CARE ABOUT YOU

28:10.050 --> 28:12.939
AND I APPRECIATE YOU.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.356
AND, WELL...

28:15.390 --> 28:17.950
I LOVE YOU, SHAWN.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.822
OKAY, BUDDY.
I HEAR YA.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.839
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE BACK

WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THE BANK,

28:47.520 --> 28:49.010
YOU DIDN'T FIND HIM.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.187
HE FOUND YOU.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.994
HIS HANDS WERE QUICKER
THAN YOUR GUN.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.019
WHAT?

28:56.060 --> 28:58.369
JUST STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
SAY NOTHING.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.163
DO NOT PICK UP
THE BANK LINE.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.964
DO NOT FIELD ANY CALLS
UNTIL I RETURN, OKAY?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.400

29:33.600 --> 29:34.897
I WANT

29:34.940 --> 29:36.191
N-N-NO WAY, LUNTZ.
THIS IS OUR GUY.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.832
ANY DEBRIEFING IS GOING
TO BE DONE BY US.

29:37.870 --> 29:39.804
NO, THIS IS
MY INVESTIGATION.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.602
WELL, GUYS, GUYS!

29:40.640 --> 29:41.800

30:44.170 --> 30:44.864
HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT

30:44.910 --> 30:46.036
THERE ARE HOSTAGES
IN THERE.

30:46.070 --> 30:47.037
I KNOW THAT.

30:47.070 --> 30:48.037
MY BEST FRIEND

30:48.080 --> 30:49.229
IF WE CAN GET

LOOK, I AM BREAKING ABOUT
50 CODES OF POLICE PROCEDURE

30:55.350 --> 30:56.339

I HAPPEN To FIND HIS AGE

32:02.050 --> 32:03.210

32:03.250 --> 32:04.683
HE'S DISTINGUISHED,

32:04.720 --> 32:06.142
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
HE KNOWS WHO HE IS.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.181
AND THAT...

33:11.190 --> 33:13.215
SO...IF YOU THINK THIS GUY
CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY,

33:13.250 --> 33:14.649
OR EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,

33:14.690 --> 33:16.248
AND THERE'S JUST A TINY PART
OF YOU THAT THINKS

33:16.290 --> 33:17.655
THAT THERE MIGHT BE
A CHANCE FOR THAT,

33:17.690 --> 33:20.181

THAT PLACE IS A LITTLE STUFFY.
DON'T YOU THINK?

33:36.080 --> 33:37.274
I LIKE THEIR BREAD.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.114
CLEAR.
CLEAR.

33:48.160 --> 33:48.956
SPEN--

33:48.990 --> 33:50.252
SPENCER,
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

33:50.290 --> 33:51.689
I TOLD YOU TO STAY
IN THE CAR.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.824
IF I'D STAYED IN THE CAR,

33:57.860 --> 33:58.622
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TELL YOU,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.194
THAT SOMEONE JUST
TOOK OFF RUNNING

34:00.230 --> 34:01.595
THAT WAY TH ROUGH THE YARD.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.835
(Lassiter)
THEY'RE GONE.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.269
I'LL CALL IN
A PERIMETER REQUEST.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.402
GET K-9 DOWN HERE.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.702
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
WITH THIS GAG?

34:07.740 --> 34:09.799
YEAH.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.829
[sobbing]

34:10.880 --> 34:12.472
HELLO, JOANNA.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.775
I HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM YOUR HUSBAND.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.288
I'M GOING TO TRY
TO MAKE CONTACT ONE MORE TIME,

34:18.320 --> 34:19.617
AND THEN THAT'S IT.

34:19.650 --> 34:22.289
PREPARE TO GO IN
WITH THE GAS.

34:25.690 --> 34:28.659
[phone ringing]

34:37.840 --> 34:39.137
YOU.
COME ON.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.307
COME ON, RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT NOW.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.307
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

34:41.340 --> 34:42.272
DON'T MOVE!

34:42.310 --> 34:44.244
DON'T TALK!
LOOK AT THE FLOOR!

34:44.280 --> 34:45.304
LOOK AT THE FLOOR.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.339
COME ON.
RIGHT NOW.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.814
IN HERE, IN HERE.
GET IN THERE.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.112
WHAT?

34:50.150 --> 34:52.516
[thud]
OH!

34:52.550 --> 34:54.711
YOU HAVE MY WIFE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.682
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.620
[muffled arguing]

34:58.660 --> 35:00.321
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.
I SWEAR--YOU'RE CRAZY.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.554
WHERE'S MY WIFE?!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.249
I DON'T KNOW!

35:03.300 --> 35:04.722
[yelling continues]

35:04.770 --> 35:05.794
(Lassiter)
ALL RIGHT, MRS. STUBBINS.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.627
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE MAN

35:07.670 --> 35:09.399
THAT KIDNAPPED YOU?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.362
WELL, THERE WERE
ACTUALLY TWO MEN.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.298
TWO?

35:13.340 --> 35:14.830
ARE YOU SURE?

35:15.810 --> 35:16.799
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

35:18.280 --> 35:20.248
[thud]
[gasp]

35:25.350 --> 35:26.817
I WAS BLINDFOLDED,

35:26.850 --> 35:28.351
BUT THROUGH A CRACK
IN THE BOTTOM,

35:28.390 --> 35:30.449
I WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT
TWO PAIRS OF FEET.

35:30.490 --> 35:31.787
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH,

35:31.830 --> 35:33.627
BUT I KNOW ONE OF THEM
WAS WEARING

35:33.660 --> 35:35.924
A PAIR OF BROWN WING TIP SHOES.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.848
BROWN.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.374
I GOT IT.

35:52.410 --> 35:53.900
THE OTHER ONE'S IN THE BANK.

35:53.950 --> 35:55.508
I GOTTA CALL PHIL
AND WARN HIM.

35:55.550 --> 35:58.417
[ringing]

36:09.330 --> 36:10.592
THAT'S IT, MEN.

36:10.630 --> 36:12.495
IT'S GO TIME.

36:12.530 --> 36:14.691
HIT 'EM WITH THE TEARGAS
AND GO IN ON MY CALL.

36:14.740 --> 36:24.775
[men Shouting]

36:24.780 --> 36:30.912
[men Shouting]

36:30.950 --> 36:32.986
(Juliet)
MORGAN PHELPS IS THE
SECOND MAN INSIDE THE BANK.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.282
CANINE CAUGHT THE GUY
RUNNING AWAY

36:34.320 --> 36:35.457
FROM THE HOUSE,
WHO GAVE THEM UP.

36:35.490 --> 36:36.912
BUT I DON'T GET
THE BANK MANAGER.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.882
GRESLING KNEW THE BANK
WAS GOING TO BE ROBBED?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.158
HE PLANNED THE WHOLE THING
FROM THE BEGINNING.

36:40.190 --> 36:42.920
HE KNEW THAT HIS V.I.P. CLIENT
HAD DROPPED OFF THE DIAMONDS.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.928
THE DIAMONDS WERE DEPOSITED
IN THAT PARTICULAR BOX

36:44.970 --> 36:46.369
ONE WEEK PRIOR.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.992
HE FIGURED THIS
WAS HIS CHANCE TO SCORE BIG.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.294
SO HE CONTACTED
MORGAN PHELPS.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.604
(Juliet)
WHO HAS A RAP SHEET
AS LONG AS MY ARM.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.471
SO WHY DIDN'T PHELPS JUST STEAL
THE DIAMONDS HIMSELF?

36:54.510 --> 36:55.704
THEY DIDN'T NEED
A PROFESSIONAL BANK ROBBER

36:55.740 --> 36:57.230
BECAUSE GRESLING
WOULD BASICALLY

36:57.280 --> 36:58.508
JUST BE HANDING
THE DIAMONDS OVER.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.949
AND PHIL
WAS A PERFECT MARK.

36:59.980 --> 37:01.572
THEY COULD PUT HIM
IN THE BANK

37:01.620 --> 37:02.746
ON THE DAY THE DIAMONDS
WERE DELIVERED.

37:02.780 --> 37:03.678
THAT, PLUS THE BACK TAXES,
AND THE RECENT FORECLOSURE,

37:03.720 --> 37:05.483
MADE HIM SEEM LIKE
A REALLY DESPERATE GUY

37:05.520 --> 37:07.488
WHO NEEDED CASH
IN A BIG WAY.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.657
SO PHELPS PLANTS HIMSELF
AT THE BANK

37:08.690 --> 37:09.611
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
GOES SMOOTHLY,

37:09.660 --> 37:11.321
AND THEN FINDS HIMSELF
CAUGHT AS A HOSTAGE

37:11.360 --> 37:12.850
WHEN THE WHOLE DEAL
GOES SOUTH.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.721
I'LL KEEP TRYING LUNTZ,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S BLOCKED

37:14.760 --> 37:16.625
ALL CALLS NOT COMING
FROM INSIDE THE BANK.

37:16.660 --> 37:17.991
WE NEED TO GET BACK
THERE BEFORE HE GOES IN.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.807
LU NTZ!

37:31.850 --> 37:33.738
(Shawn)
HAVE YOUR GUYS GRAB GRESLING,
THE BANK MANAGER.

37:33.780 --> 37:34.747
TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.
HE'S IN ON IT.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.747
WE'RE LOOKING FOR PHELPS.

37:35.780 --> 37:36.815
WHO?

37:36.850 --> 37:37.874
PHELPS. HAVE YOU ACCOUNTED
FOR ALL THE HOSTAGES?

37:37.920 --> 37:39.911
WE'RE COUNTING BODIES NOW.
IT'S A MESS OUT HERE.

37:39.950 --> 37:40.939
ALL RIGHT.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.628
(Shawn)
THERE'S NO WING TIPS.
PHELPS IS GONE.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.321
HE MUST'VE TAKEN OFF SOMEWHERE.
WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HIM?

37:50.360 --> 37:52.294
WE WERE BEING HELD
IN A BACK ROOM.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.809
I KNOW WHERE PHELPS IS.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.502
WHERE?
HE'S IN THE SEWER.
HE'S IN THE SEWER SYSTEM.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.006
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:07.050 --> 38:08.813
IS IT, LUNTZ?
ALL RIGHT, I DO KNOW THIS MUCH.

38:08.850 --> 38:10.772
IF SOMEONE WERE TO ACCESS
THE SEWER SYSTEM OUT BACK,

38:10.820 --> 38:12.344
IT WOULD DUMP THEM
ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE CITY.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.516
LUNTZ, I'M A PSYCHIC.

38:13.550 --> 38:14.517
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.686
PLUS, LISTEN TO MY VOICE.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.813
IT'S EVEN.
IT'S STEADY. NO VIBRATO.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.797
GUS, QUICK.

38:25.830 --> 38:26.626
HELP ME BOOST LASSIE
UP TO THE CEILING.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.831
PHELPS IS INSIDE
ONE OF THESE DUCTS.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.337
WHAT?
WHATEVER HAPPENED

38:30.370 --> 38:31.462
TO THE WHOLE PSYCHIC SEWER
VISION THING?

38:31.510 --> 38:32.602
LASSIE, DO WE REALLY HAVE TIME
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS?

38:32.640 --> 38:33.504
NOW, COME ON.

38:33.540 --> 38:36.008
JUST GIVE ME ONE
OF THOSE SIZE 12 NARROWS.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.384
[grunts]

38:51.830 --> 38:52.922
FREEZE!

38:55.560 --> 38:56.652
COME HERE.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.361
[grunting]

38:58.400 --> 38:59.697
[groans]

38:59.730 --> 39:02.039
HOLD STILL.
I GOT HIM!

39:02.070 --> 39:03.799
GOOD WORK, PARTNER.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.364
WE'LL GRAB BACKUP.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.032
PARTNER?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.900
UH, EXCUSE ME.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

39:12.950 --> 39:14.372
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S BETTER THAN

39:14.420 --> 39:16.411
A LITTLE BOY CAT...
OR A LITTLE GIRL CAT.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.644
NOT APPRECIATED, SHAWN.

39:17.680 --> 39:18.942
BUT LOOK AT YOU, MAN,

39:18.990 --> 39:21.049
SURVIVING
A BANK HOSTAGE CRISIS

39:21.090 --> 39:22.648
AND STILL LOOKING
ALL POITIER...

39:22.690 --> 39:24.009
ON A HOT DAY.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.129
WHAT?

39:25.160 --> 39:26.787
GO AHEAD.
SLAP ME IN THE FACE.

39:26.830 --> 39:27.785
TELL ME
THEY CALL YOU MR. TIBBS.

39:27.830 --> 39:28.854
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.094
COME ON,
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

39:30.130 --> 39:33.588
THEY CALL ME MR.--
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.393
(Shawn)
BUT YOU WERE ONE WORD AWAY!

39:35.440 --> 39:37.135
COME ON.
WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?

39:37.170 --> 39:38.137
(Gus)
WILL YOU GET IN THE CAR?

39:38.170 --> 39:39.501
(Shawn)
THEY CALL YOU WHAT?

39:39.540 --> 39:49.677
THEY CALL YOU MR.--
[laughs]

39:49.720 --> 39:52.883
[knocking]

39:53.890 --> 39:55.414
JULES.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.779
HI.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.879
WHAT ARE YOU---

39:58.930 --> 40:02.127
UH, EVIDENCE TURNED THESE
OVER TO ME.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.559
I THINK THEY'RE GUS'S SHOES.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.692
SO...

40:04.730 --> 40:06.664
I JUST, UM--

40:06.700 --> 40:08.019
I THOUGHT
I'D BRING THEM BY

40:08.070 --> 40:10.664
AND DROP THEM OFF.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.133
THAT IS VERY SWEET
OF YOU.

40:12.170 --> 40:14.570
YOU CAN BURN THEM.
WHAT?

40:14.610 --> 40:16.202
HE WAS DEVASTATED
THE WHOLE WAY HOME.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.673
HE CRIED
ABOUT THEM ALREADY.

40:17.710 --> 40:19.007
ON MY SHOULDER,
LIKE A BABY.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.871
I JUST PUT HIM DOWN.
HE'S RESTING NOW.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.217
SO WHAT IS THIS?

40:23.250 --> 40:25.787
WHAT AM I SEEING HERE?
THIS IS THE UH...

40:25.820 --> 40:27.708
"RETURNING FOOTWEAR
TO A FRIEND" OUTFIT?

40:27.750 --> 40:29.957
OH, CAMERON
HAD TO CANCEL TONIGHT.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.480
NO.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.485
YEAH.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.724
NO!
YEAH.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.625
HE SAID HE TOOK, LIKE,
FOUR SHOWERS,

40:35.660 --> 40:39.926
BUT, HE STILL COULDN'T GET THAT
SEWER SMELL OUT OF HIS SKIN.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.938
AW, JEEZ!
THAT DAMN SEWER!

40:41.970 --> 40:43.699
WE WRAPPED EVERYTHING UP
SO NICELY

40:43.740 --> 40:45.059
SO THAT YOU GUYS COULD...

40:45.110 --> 40:46.759
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:46.810 --> 40:48.004
THE MAN FOLLOWED
A HUNCH.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.678
AND THAT'S ALL YOU CAN ASK
FROM A GUY.

40:49.710 --> 40:51.849
HEY, FOLLOW YOUR HUNCHES.
AND HE DID.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.144
I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
FOR YOU KIDS.

40:54.180 --> 40:57.638
BUT YOU GAVE IT
A REAL SHOT, A FAIR SHOT.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.113
SHAWN, I'M SEEING HIM
TOMORROW NIGHT.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.219
REALLY?
WOW.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.754
THAT'S SO FAST
ON THE RESCHEDULING.

41:03.790 --> 41:04.859
IT'S--
NO CONFLICTS?

41:04.890 --> 41:06.027
EITHER WAY?
HUH.

41:06.060 --> 41:07.823
MM-MM.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.192
YEAH, WE'LL SEE.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.830
WELL, I SHOULD GO.

41:15.870 --> 41:19.101
HEY, UH, HAVE YOU EATEN?
NO.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.529
WELL, I CAN'T OFFER
ANYTHING AS FANCY AS MARIO'S.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.877
BUT, UH...

41:22.910 --> 41:23.877
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF A BALLPARK FRANK

41:23.910 --> 41:25.502
AND A STROLL
ON THE BOARDWALK?

41:25.550 --> 41:27.700
IT IS GOLDEN TIME.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.538
I'VE BEEN TOLD I, UH, I LOOK
PRETTY GOOD IN THAT LIGHTING.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.841
REALLY?
IT'S TRUE.

41:32.890 --> 41:34.039
IS THAT RIGHT?

41:34.090 --> 41:37.912
[whirring noise]

41:37.960 --> 41:40.281
[giggIeS]

41:40.330 --> 41:41.729
THEY PLUMP
WHEN YOU COOK THEM.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.125
THEY PLUMP!

41:43.160 --> 41:44.923
LITERALLY.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.894
AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES,
THE WEINER ABSORBS

41:47.930 --> 41:50.763
ALL ADDITIONAL MOISTURE,
CAUSING IT TO DOUBLE,

41:50.800 --> 41:52.734
SOMETIMES EVEN TRIPLE,
IN DIAMETER.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.601
TRIPLE? WOW!
