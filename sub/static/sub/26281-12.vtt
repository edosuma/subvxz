Okay.

as Chief of Surgery

President?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.555
My dual role
was a benefit.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.756

I can be both President

Really?

of your staying on

would've been different

if someone else was Chief
during the outbreak?

You used to have more time
to manage scheduling issues.

did complicate our response.

my decision now.

an indecisive fool.

spent together to be our last.

be under a microscope.

Dr. Blaize will have to agree.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.916
Or I'll get
another doctor.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.150
I want to get this
over with.

36:59.184 --> 37:02.854

do the same.
