04:41.990 --> 04:43.573
Caroline: HOW DO
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

04:43.741 --> 04:47.744
Mary: EVERYBODY KNOWS.
THEY CAPTURED HER IN
A RAID A LONG TIME AGO,

04:47.912 --> 04:51.623
AND NO MATTER HOW HER FATHER
SEARCHED AND SEARCHED,
HE COULDN'T FIND HER.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.458
Laura: ARE YOU
SURE IT WAS HER?

04:53.626 --> 04:57.004
Mary: UH-HUH. AND THE BOY'S
NAME IS SPOTTED EAGLE,

04:57.171 --> 04:59.089
AND MR. STOKES DOESN'T
LIKE IT AT ALL.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.091
YOU'VE GOT MIGHTY
SHARP EARS, MISS.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.718
YOU COULD TELL
HE WAS INDIAN,

05:02.885 --> 05:06.179
EVEN THOUGH HE WORE THE
SAME KIND OF CLOTHES
ALL THE BOYS DO.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.890
HE'S AN ORPHAN.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.728
CAN YOU IMAGINE? A
REAL LIVE INDIAN RIGHT
HERE IN WALNUT GROVE.

05:12.895 --> 05:17.107
I THINK WE'VE HEARD
QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT
FOR A WHILE, MARY.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.734
I WONDER
HOW SHE
ESCAPED.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.861

MISSED YOU, GIRL.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.304
DID THEY TREAT
YOU WELL, AMELIA?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.808
I MEAN, DID THEY
TREAT YOU DECENT?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.228
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE. OF
COURSE THEY DID.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.564
EVEN WHEN I WAS
TEACHING AT THE
MISSION SCHOOL,

07:20.731 --> 07:23.024
THEY MADE ME
FEEL WELCOME.

07:23.192 --> 07:27.946
AND WHEN WHITE BUFFALO
MARRIED ME, I BECAME
PART OF HIS FAMILY.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.994
THAT CAN WAIT.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.621
I DON'T
THINK IT CAN.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.253
HOW YOU COULD
FALL IN LOVE WITH
ONE OF THEM...

07:43.421 --> 07:45.797
WHITE BUFFALO
WAS THE KINDEST,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.717
THE MOST LOVING MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.261

HE WAS A SAVAGE!

07:58.269 --> 08:01.771

WHAT ABOUT THEM?

08:03.900 --> 08:06.276

PUT THE PAST
BEHIND US.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.447
PEOPLE HERE BELIEVE
YOU WERE TAKEN CAPTIVE.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.158
I WOULDN'T LET
THEM KNOW YOU WERE
A WILLING SQUAW.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.785
WHAT ABOUT
SPOTTED EAGLE?

08:15.953 --> 08:18.872
HE'S AN ORPHAN.
YOU ADOPTED HIM.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.250
YOU BROUGHT
HIM WITH YOU
WHEN YOU LEFT.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.419
YOU THINK PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO
BELIEVE THAT?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.755
I LIVED WITH
THEM FOR 12
YEARS, PAPA!

08:26.923 --> 08:29.799
THEY BELIEVE IT
NOW, AND YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO CHANGE IT.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.886

ALL THE TIME YOU'VE
BEEN GONE, YOUNG LADY.

BE THE WAY I SAID.

CALL HIM JOSEPH?

ADOPTED HIM.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.182

YOU WANT.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.632
IT'S IN THE BLOOD.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.306
WELL, YOU, UH...

37:06.474 --> 37:08.600
NOW, YOU TELL SETH
THAT I'LL HAVE JOSEPH

37:08.768 --> 37:10.477
APOLOGIZE TO HIM
IN THE MORNING.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.979
OH, I WILL, AS
SOON AS I SEE HIM.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.649
GOOD-BYE.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.109
SO LONG,
AND THANKS FOR
BRINGING IT BACK.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.163
ALL RIGHT, YOU
CAN COME OUT NOW.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.835
COME ON,
GET OUT HERE!

37:48.057 --> 37:51.142
HOW COME YOU LET
AN INJUN KID GET
THE BEST OF YOU?

37:53.562 --> 37:56.773
I ASKED YOU
HOW COME, BOY.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.733
YOU'VE GOT
AN ANSWER?

38:00.152 --> 38:03.154
YOU SHAME ME, BOY.

38:15.334 --> 38:18.295
SUPPER'S READY
WHEN YOU ARE,
PAPA.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.259
WHERE'S
THE BOY?

38:24.427 --> 38:26.928
IN BED.
HE'S EATEN.

38:30.850 --> 38:31.933
NO, YOU
DON'T, PAPA.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.143
NOW, YOU LEAVE
ME BE, AMELIA.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.562
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TOUCH HIM.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.272
THE BOY NEEDS
A LESSON, AMELIA.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.232
I'VE GOT TO
GIVE IT TO HIM.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.735
HE BROUGHT
THAT HORSE HOME

38:41.902 --> 38:44.404
BECAUSE HE
THOUGHT YOU'D
BE PROUD OF HIM,

38:44.572 --> 38:45.864
BUT YOU'VE MADE
HIM SO MISERABLE

38:46.032 --> 38:48.950
THAT NOW HE
WANTS TO GO BACK
TO HIS PEOPLE.

38:51.704 --> 38:55.415
WELL, IF HE CAN'T
LEARN WHITE MAN'S WAYS,
AMELIA, THEN LET HIM.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.917
THEN I GO, TOO.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.712
Jeremy: WELL, YOU WERE
STARVING OUT THERE, AMELIA.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.340
Amelia: AND HE'S
STARVING...HERE.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.717
Jeremy:
I CAN'T HELP THAT.

39:05.885 --> 39:09.054
Amelia: MY SON AND I WILL
LEAVE BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.097
[DOOR CLOSES]

39:11.265 --> 39:13.016
Jeremy: AMELIA!

39:31.869 --> 39:33.536
THERE'S
JOSEPH.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.205
YOU GO ON
AHEAD. I WANT
TO TALK TO HIM.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.290
DON'T
BE LATE.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.710
WHAT HAPPENED
ABOUT THE HORSE?

39:40.878 --> 39:44.172
MY GRANDFATHER
GAVE HIM BACK.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.174
WANT TO SEE
MY BEAR CLAW?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.843
IT IS OSAGE.
IT BRINGS YOU
GOOD FORTUNE.

39:49.011 --> 39:52.555
A CHIEF
GAVE IT TO ME.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.525
RUN!

40:14.036 --> 40:15.412
SPLIT UP!

40:52.074 --> 40:56.953
HOLD HIM!

41:13.137 --> 41:13.887
PA?

41:14.054 --> 41:15.346
Charles: UP HERE!

41:15.514 --> 41:16.931
Laura: YOU'VE GOT TO COME,
QUICK! YOU'VE GOT TO!

41:17.099 --> 41:18.683
WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

41:18.851 --> 41:22.020
IT'S JOSEPH. THEY'RE
GOING TO KILL HIM,
SETH AND HIS FRIENDS.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.855
SHOW ME.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.887
SETH JOHNSON
AND HIS FRIENDS.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.019
ALL RIGHT, GET
ME SOME WATER,

42:03.187 --> 42:06.105
ANY MEDICINE YOU
HAVE IN THE HOUSE.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.273
WHISKEY WILL DO.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.983
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?

42:09.151 --> 42:12.403
SETH JOHNSON AND HIS
FRIENDS TAUGHT HIM
MORE WHITE MAN'S WAYS.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.660
THERE DON'T
SEEM TO BE ANY
BONES BROKE.

42:18.827 --> 42:21.663
I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT
THE INSIDE.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.207
A WHOLE BUNCH
OF THEM BEATING
UP ON HIM.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.503
HERE, LET
ME HAVE IT.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.505
LET ME
IN THERE.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.300
JUST LET
ME IN HERE.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.597
IT'S ALL
RIGHT, BOY.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.808
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE ALL RIGHT.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.061
YOUR GRANDPA IS
GOING TO TAKE
CARE OF YOU.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.896
YOU ARE NOT
MY GRANDPA!

42:47.064 --> 42:49.899
YOU'RE A
WHITE MAN.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.234
I'M TRYING TO
HELP YOU, BOY.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.361
I AM AN INDIAN.

42:53.529 --> 42:58.116
I DO NOT NEED THE
HELP OF A WHITE MAN.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.493
YOU HAVE TO
STAY IN BED.

43:00.661 --> 43:04.038
HE TOLD ME NOT
TO SHOW MY FACE IN
SCHOOL OR IN TOWN.

43:04.206 --> 43:07.333
I MUST GO
TO SCHOOL NOW.
YOU KNOW THAT.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.919
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO
LET HIM GO.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.964
YES.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.466
YEAH, BECAUSE
HE MUST GO,

43:15.634 --> 43:17.885
BECAUSE HE IS
HIS FATHER'S SON,

43:18.053 --> 43:22.098
AND HE'LL NOT
ALLOW THE WHITE MAN
TO DRIVE HIM AWAY.

43:22.266 --> 43:26.686
AS YOU'VE SAID,
IT'S IN HIS BLOOD.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.243
THEY'LL BEAT
HIM UP AGAIN.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.871
BEING STUPID
AND STUBBORN.

43:46.332 --> 43:50.835
THEN PERHAPS HE HAS SOME
OF HIS GRANDFATHER'S
BLOOD, TOO.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.684
MARIE?

44:09.897 --> 44:10.938
VERY GOOD.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.273
THAT'S
VERY GOOD.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.776
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO KEEP GOING
WITH THE SIXES.

44:14.943 --> 44:16.736
THEN AFTER YOU DO
THE SIXES, DO THE
SEVENS LIKE THAT.

44:16.904 --> 44:20.406
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO
BE A LITTLE HARD, BUT
YOU CONTINUE TO DO IT.

44:26.121 --> 44:27.246
WHAT HAPPENED?

44:27.414 --> 44:28.831
NOTHING.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.502
JOSEPH, YOU
HAVE TO TELL ME!

44:35.464 --> 44:37.090
JOSEPH!

44:38.300 --> 44:40.468
SETH AND HIS
FRIENDS DID IT.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.312
IS THAT TRUE?

44:51.480 --> 44:53.398
ANSWER ME!

44:53.565 --> 44:54.941
YEAH!

44:55.109 --> 44:57.777
AND IT'LL HAPPEN
AGAIN IF HE SHOWS UP
FOR SCHOOL TOMORROW.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.322
WE DON'T WANT
NO INJUN KIDS
AROUND HERE.

45:01.490 --> 45:05.118
Jeremy: MY GRANDSON
GOES WHEREVER HE PLEASES.

45:21.510 --> 45:25.972
NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO
SAY ANYTHING TO THE
BOYS THAT BEAT HIM UP.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.850
I'VE BEEN A LOT
WORSE TO HIM...

45:29.017 --> 45:31.978
AND PROBABLY FOR
THE SAME OLD REASONS.

45:43.282 --> 45:48.411
I EVEN DENIED HE WAS
MY OWN GRANDSON...

45:48.579 --> 45:50.997
MY DAUGHTER'S BOY.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.752
WELL, HE IS.

45:57.963 --> 46:00.214
AND I'M PROUD OF HIM.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.596
AND I'M SORRY.

46:08.932 --> 46:11.601
I'M SORRY I LIED.

46:16.982 --> 46:19.734
NOW, THERE'S BEEN
SOME TALK HERE ABOUT...

46:21.528 --> 46:24.864
ABOUT HIM NOT SHOWING
HIS FACE AGAIN.

46:27.826 --> 46:29.952
WELL, HE'S HERE.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.249
AND HE'S STAYING HERE.

46:37.252 --> 46:39.629
Jeremy:
NOW, MISS BEADLE,

46:39.797 --> 46:44.383
MY GRANDSON'S NAME
IS SPOTTED EAGLE...

46:46.220 --> 46:51.265
AND I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED
IF YOU'D MAKE THAT
CHANGE ON YOUR LEDGER.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.435
I'D BE HAPPY TO,
MR. STOKES.

46:54.603 --> 46:56.771
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.906
SEE YOU AT HOME,
GRANDPA.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.834
SEE YOU AT HOME, BOY.
