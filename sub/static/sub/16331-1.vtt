WOMAN:
<i> From the very first moment,</i>

00:05.015 --> 00:08.149
<i> I felt danger there.</i>

00:08.151 --> 00:09.651
Who's out there?

00:09.653 --> 00:11.753
(distorted howl, shriek)

00:14.524 --> 00:16.324
Oh!

00:16.326 --> 00:19.094
My family was in danger
and all I could do was watch.

00:19.096 --> 00:21.930
<i> When you see something</i>
<i> like this,</i>

00:21.932 --> 00:24.399
a lot of crazy thoughts
go through your head.

00:26.503 --> 00:29.704
WOMAN:<i> Humans respond to fear</i>
<i> in two simple ways:</i>

00:29.706 --> 00:31.873
fight or flight.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.075
(inhuman howling)

00:47.791 --> 00:49.791
Our friends used to tease us

00:49.793 --> 00:52.127
that they didn't like
socializing with Matt and I

00:52.129 --> 00:54.596
because we were too perfect.

00:54.598 --> 00:56.298
They'd get in fights in the car

00:56.300 --> 00:59.034
on the way home from dinner
with us because...

00:59.036 --> 01:00.635
we made them feel like

01:00.637 --> 01:03.405
they weren't as in love
as Matt and I were.

01:03.407 --> 01:06.241
I won a free yoga class
at a work raffle.

01:06.243 --> 01:08.076
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.

01:08.078 --> 01:11.146
Shelby was the teacher. I...

01:11.148 --> 01:13.782
pulled a hamstring and never
took a yoga class again,

01:13.784 --> 01:17.118
but it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.087
Things were going really well.

01:19.089 --> 01:21.556
<i> We settled in Los Angeles--</i>

01:21.558 --> 01:24.392
<i>the yoga capital of the world--</i>

01:24.394 --> 01:25.994
<i> and...</i>

01:25.996 --> 01:27.996
decided to start a family.

01:27.998 --> 01:29.998
Yeah, we found out that,
uh, Shelby was pregnant

01:30.000 --> 01:31.733
on the same day
that I got promoted

01:31.735 --> 01:34.102
to West Coast sales manager,
so we decided

01:34.104 --> 01:37.238
<i> to go out and celebrate both.</i>

01:39.276 --> 01:40.742

(screams)

01:40.744 --> 01:43.645
That was the worst night
of our lives.

01:43.647 --> 01:46.481
No, no!
MATT:<i> It was a gang initiation.</i>

01:46.483 --> 01:49.284
<i> Game of knockout.</i>
<i> They had to</i>

01:49.286 --> 01:51.186

on the street,

01:51.188 --> 01:53.655

01:53.657 --> 01:55.423
knock 'em out.

01:55.425 --> 01:56.958
Help!

01:56.960 --> 01:58.159

If I lost Matt...

02:20.317 --> 02:21.516
Mrs. Miller?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.954
Is he okay?

02:25.956 --> 02:28.323
His orbital socket is broken.

02:28.325 --> 02:32.060
He will need surgery
once the swelling goes down.

02:32.062 --> 02:35.630
Our bigger concern is he hasn't
regained consciousness.

02:35.632 --> 02:38.566
Well, I need to see him.

02:38.568 --> 02:40.335
If I'm with him, he'll wake up.

02:40.337 --> 02:41.970
I know it.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.441
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

03:18.775 --> 03:21.342
I was right.

03:21.344 --> 03:23.344
As soon as we touched,

03:23.346 --> 03:25.680
he started waking up.

03:25.682 --> 03:28.049
That's just...

03:28.051 --> 03:31.719
that's just the kind of
connection that we have.

03:31.721 --> 03:34.589
<i> He was gonna be okay.</i>

03:34.591 --> 03:36.024
But she wasn't.

03:41.631 --> 03:44.899
She lost the baby.

They don't know

03:52.976 --> 03:54.309
(clears throat)

04:35.919 --> 04:39.087

05:17.160 --> 05:18.893
It was in great shape.

MATT:<i> It felt like</i>

AUCTIONEER:
Opening bid is $21,000.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.856
What is your bid?

05:48.858 --> 05:50.858
Well, now, that includes
the ten acres

05:50.860 --> 05:52.360
of forest around the house.

05:52.362 --> 05:54.062
But you can't build on it.

05:54.064 --> 05:55.363
It's protected.

05:55.365 --> 05:57.232
That seems
inexpensive.

<i> Maybe my wounds</i>

13:30.453 --> 13:32.820
Luckily, that's-that's
what I do for a living.

13:32.822 --> 13:34.722
(inhales deeply)

13:34.724 --> 13:38.459
(exhales deeply)

13:43.466 --> 13:46.567
(wind whistling, creaking)

13:51.574 --> 13:54.041
(sizzling)

13:59.182 --> 14:01.882
(shutter bangs loudly)
Oh!

14:01.884 --> 14:04.218
(loud, rhythmic clattering)

14:04.220 --> 14:06.387
(sighs)

14:06.389 --> 14:08.055
(wind whistling)

14:08.057 --> 14:09.657
(laughs)

14:09.659 --> 14:12.126
(wood creaking)

14:32.348 --> 14:35.449
(echoing):
Is anyone there?

14:59.275 --> 15:01.142
Hello?

15:04.413 --> 15:06.847
Hello?

15:21.297 --> 15:23.731
(sighs)

15:29.338 --> 15:31.806
(insects trilling and chirring)

16:01.137 --> 16:03.204
(trilling, chirring continuing)

16:32.735 --> 16:35.202
(water gently splashing)

16:52.388 --> 16:54.922
(muffled scream)

17:09.105 --> 17:11.772
MATT:<i> Well, Shelby called me,</i>
<i> panicked, crying,</i>

17:11.774 --> 17:13.874
<i> saying she had been attacked.</i>

17:13.876 --> 17:16.443
<i> I was in Raleigh,</i>
<i> two hours away,</i>

17:16.445 --> 17:19.413
<i> but I made it home</i>
<i> in half the time.</i>

17:21.183 --> 17:23.250
Where's Shelby?
Is she all right?

17:23.252 --> 17:25.686
She's inside.

17:25.688 --> 17:28.088
You her husband?

17:28.090 --> 17:31.592
Your wife reported
that she was assaulted

17:31.594 --> 17:33.594
and held underwater
in the hot tub.

17:33.596 --> 17:35.696
She<i> claimed</i> to have

17:35.698 --> 17:38.098
struggled against
her attackers.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.700
What do you mean, "claimed?"

17:39.702 --> 17:42.469
I found no evidence of
footprints or marks on the deck

17:42.471 --> 17:44.471
or in the grounds
around the hot tub.

17:44.473 --> 17:47.308
She also said her attackers
were dressed in old costumes

17:47.310 --> 17:50.144
holding pitchforks and torches.

17:50.146 --> 17:51.779
Does she imbibe?

17:51.781 --> 17:54.748
I know exactly
who did this.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.717
It's those ZZ Top wannabes.

17:56.719 --> 17:58.953
They've been trying
to scare us off

17:58.955 --> 18:00.554
since we bought
this place.

18:00.556 --> 18:02.256
I'll bet it's the Polks.

18:02.258 --> 18:04.291
Let me, uh, go have
a talk with them.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.160
Those guys keep to themselves,

18:06.162 --> 18:08.495
and they're, uh,
not so easy to find.

18:08.497 --> 18:11.065
We need protection!
Get a gun.

18:11.067 --> 18:13.167
What?!
<i> That cop--</i>

18:13.169 --> 18:15.602
he wasn't gonna do
a damn thing for us.

18:15.604 --> 18:17.171
<i> I could tell by his manner,</i>

18:17.173 --> 18:20.607
<i> and his-his...</i>
<i> his condescending attitude.</i>

18:20.609 --> 18:22.476
He said he'd file a report,
but I knew

18:22.478 --> 18:25.012
it would just end up in the
bottom of a drawer somewhere.

18:25.014 --> 18:28.015
Was it those guys
from the auction?

18:28.017 --> 18:30.617
(quietly):
No.

18:30.619 --> 18:32.419
I don't... I don't know.

18:32.421 --> 18:34.121
It's just,

18:34.123 --> 18:35.756
what you told the cops

18:35.758 --> 18:37.992
didn't make a whole lot
of sense there, Shelby.

18:37.994 --> 18:40.327
I saw what I saw.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.964
They held you down...
until they let you up?

18:43.966 --> 18:46.133
SHELBY:
<i> I was really scared.</i>

18:46.135 --> 18:47.668
I was choking on water.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.203
<i> When I could finally</i>
<i> see clearly,</i>

18:49.205 --> 18:50.804
<i> they were gone.</i>
<i> I ran inside</i>

18:50.806 --> 18:52.806
to call the police,
then I called you.

18:52.808 --> 18:55.843
(sighs)

18:55.845 --> 18:57.211
What?

18:57.213 --> 18:58.712
The cops said

18:58.714 --> 19:02.483
that they didn't find
anything by the hot tub.

19:02.485 --> 19:05.352
No fingerprints, no torches.

19:06.555 --> 19:09.223
They must have
come back for them.

19:09.225 --> 19:11.792
I wasn't imagining things, Matt.

19:11.794 --> 19:13.327
I wasn't.

19:13.329 --> 19:15.529
Mm.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.865
Do you think I'm lying to you?

19:19.335 --> 19:22.903
Shelby, absolutely not.

19:22.905 --> 19:25.372
No. I believe you 100%.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.974
Shelby, no.

19:26.976 --> 19:29.376
I'm sorry. I believe you.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.845
I believe you. I'm sorry.

19:31.847 --> 19:33.747
I believe you.

19:33.749 --> 19:35.516
(sighs)

19:35.518 --> 19:37.351
SHELBY:
<i> I felt so guilty,</i>

19:37.353 --> 19:42.656
<i> because I couldn't</i>
<i> tell Matt the truth.</i>

19:42.658 --> 19:45.025
I didn't want to live there.

19:45.027 --> 19:47.861
(wind chimes tinkling)

19:47.863 --> 19:49.596
(insects trilling)

19:49.598 --> 19:53.400
(inhuman howling)

20:00.576 --> 20:03.010
(howling continues)

20:23.365 --> 20:25.833
(wind chimes tinkle)

20:33.275 --> 20:35.676
(gasps)

20:40.116 --> 20:43.884
MATT:
<i> I decided not to tell Shelby</i>
<i> about what happened,</i>

20:43.886 --> 20:46.487
<i> but it was proof to me</i>
<i> that that white trash gang</i>

20:46.489 --> 20:49.990
<i> was trying to scare us away.</i>

20:53.796 --> 20:57.297
(grunts softly)

20:57.299 --> 20:59.266
<i> I had to be back</i>
<i> in Raleigh the next day, so,</i>

20:59.268 --> 21:02.603
<i> I set up security cameras</i>
<i> all around the perimeter</i>

21:02.605 --> 21:06.440
<i> that were synced to my cell</i>
<i> phone so I could keep an eye</i>

21:06.442 --> 21:08.408
<i> on the place</i>
<i> from wherever I was.</i>

21:08.410 --> 21:10.077
(crowd cawing)

21:10.079 --> 21:12.312
Not bad for an amateur.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.415
<i> But I was not going</i>
<i> to leave Shelby there alone.</i>

21:15.417 --> 21:18.085
<i> So I called my sister.</i>

21:20.990 --> 21:22.689
Shelby never liked me.

21:22.691 --> 21:26.093
Which is fine, because
I was never a huge fan of hers.

21:26.095 --> 21:28.162
<i> Yoga is not a job.</i>

21:28.164 --> 21:30.130
<i> I used to play volleyball</i>
<i> in high school.</i>

21:30.132 --> 21:32.466
<i> Back then,</i>
<i> yoga was called "stretching,"</i>

21:32.468 --> 21:35.869
and it was something you did
before, not as exercise.

21:35.871 --> 21:39.940
(chuckles)
Lee judged my yoga

21:39.942 --> 21:42.176
and my gluten allergy

21:42.178 --> 21:44.044
<i> and my two years of college.</i>

21:44.046 --> 21:47.014
<i> She thought I was too much</i>
<i> of a phony for her brother</i>

21:47.016 --> 21:49.283
<i> to marry.</i>

21:49.285 --> 21:53.153
I got my degree
in criminal psychology from UNC.

21:53.155 --> 21:56.857
<i> I was on track</i>
<i> to make detective.</i>

21:56.859 --> 21:58.158
<i> Didn't work out though.</i>

21:58.160 --> 21:59.693
<i> I didn't start taking pills</i>

21:59.695 --> 22:01.862
<i> because of some fault</i>
<i> in my character.</i>

22:01.864 --> 22:04.331
I got hurt. On the job.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.301
(indistinct shouting)

22:19.348 --> 22:21.815
(baby crying)

22:35.664 --> 22:38.098
(crying)

22:44.073 --> 22:45.872
(gunshot)
(screams)

22:45.874 --> 22:49.076
<i> Do you know</i>
<i>prescription painkillers can be</i>

22:49.078 --> 22:51.278
more addictive than heroin?

22:51.280 --> 22:54.581
<i> I went from two pills a day</i>
<i> to two an hour.</i>

22:54.583 --> 22:57.184
<i> I don't remember</i>
<i> how many I took that day.</i>

22:57.186 --> 22:59.553
<i> I don't remember</i>
<i> very much of anything at all</i>

22:59.555 --> 23:01.788
<i> that day, really. </i>
(tires screeching)

23:05.227 --> 23:06.627
(siren wailing)
(starts engine)

23:06.629 --> 23:09.196
(tires screeching)

23:09.198 --> 23:11.031
He was a serial rapist.

23:11.033 --> 23:12.766
A real asshole.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.801
I hate assholes.

23:14.803 --> 23:17.004
(tires screeching)
(sirens wailing)

23:28.951 --> 23:31.585
Put down the gun!

23:31.587 --> 23:32.486
Put it down!

23:33.822 --> 23:35.455
You heard me.
Put down the...

23:38.794 --> 23:41.628
<i> It would have been</i>
<i> his third strike.</i>

23:41.630 --> 23:45.966
<i> You ask me, it's the one time</i>
<i> the law worked exactly</i>

23:45.968 --> 23:47.367
<i> the way it should.</i>

23:48.837 --> 23:50.971
(indistinct police transmission)

23:56.111 --> 23:58.078
Hey!

24:00.316 --> 24:01.214
What you nee...

24:02.751 --> 24:04.818
They fired her.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.687
Come on, Mason.

24:06.689 --> 24:08.922
Divorce? Now?

24:08.924 --> 24:11.525
When I'm at rock bottom?
How many times

24:11.527 --> 24:13.493
have you forgotten to pick up

24:13.495 --> 24:16.163
your daughter
at school this month?

24:16.165 --> 24:17.831
Three times.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.833
Which is three more
the amount of times

24:19.835 --> 24:22.703
than you've touched me
in the past month.

24:22.705 --> 24:25.238
I'm done with this.

24:27.042 --> 24:30.277
LEE:<i> The judge awarded him</i>
<i> full custody of Flora.</i>

24:30.279 --> 24:31.511
(door shuts)

24:31.513 --> 24:33.947
<i> I got her three days every 14.</i>

24:33.949 --> 24:36.116
<i> 21% of her life.</i>

24:37.052 --> 24:40.053
That's all they gave me.

24:43.492 --> 24:47.227
Can we stop
for a moment, please?

24:49.865 --> 24:52.299
(sizzling)

24:55.070 --> 24:56.803
Hmm.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.455
(creaking)

25:40.949 --> 25:43.417
(wind blowing in distance)

26:03.806 --> 26:06.273
(sizzling continuing)

26:22.724 --> 26:23.957
LEE:
Smelling g...

26:23.959 --> 26:24.991
Oh, Jesus!

26:25.794 --> 26:27.994
Oh, Jesus, Lee!

26:27.996 --> 26:30.730
Don't sneak up on me
like that! You scared

26:30.732 --> 26:32.632
the shit out of me!

26:32.634 --> 26:35.769
My brother married
one jumpy bitch.

26:35.771 --> 26:37.604
She knew
why we called her there.

26:37.606 --> 26:40.106
And she knew that someone
was messing with us.

26:40.108 --> 26:43.743
Why would she move the knife
like that?

26:43.745 --> 26:46.746
So when did you
become a cook?

26:46.748 --> 26:49.816
What is that supposed to mean?

26:51.520 --> 26:53.854
Recently.

26:53.856 --> 26:56.490
It relaxes me.
Mmm.

26:56.492 --> 26:58.191
Cookin'?
Yes.

26:58.193 --> 26:59.593
Cooking.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.803
(sighs)
Look, can I be real

27:09.805 --> 27:11.538
with you?

27:11.540 --> 27:14.808
While I'm here,
could you please not drink

27:14.810 --> 27:17.611
inside the house?
I know it's your home,

27:17.613 --> 27:21.615
but I'm hanging on
to my sobriety by my teeth here.

27:21.617 --> 27:25.285
But don't worry,
I'll stay sober.

27:25.287 --> 27:29.289
Somebody's got to protect you
from the wild men in the woods.

27:29.291 --> 27:32.626
And I appreciate that.
Although...

27:32.628 --> 27:36.363
I wish you still had
your badge and your gun.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.665
Well, I may not
have my badge,

27:38.667 --> 27:41.735
but Mama's still packin'.

27:46.174 --> 27:48.208
<i> I'll be honest with you,</i>

27:48.210 --> 27:50.143
I never put much stock
in the stories

27:50.145 --> 27:52.646
my sister-in-law
was telling my brother.

27:52.648 --> 27:54.648
<i> She never wanted to move</i>
<i> to the country.</i>

27:54.650 --> 27:57.150
<i> I figured she was just trying</i>
<i> to scare him</i>

27:57.152 --> 27:59.553
<i> so they'd pack up</i>
<i> and move back to L.A.</i>

27:59.555 --> 28:02.055
(inhuman howling)

28:07.729 --> 28:10.897
(chimes tinkling)

28:12.734 --> 28:15.035
(creaking)

28:15.037 --> 28:18.071
Shelby, um...

28:23.011 --> 28:25.178
<i> I was pissed off.</i>

28:25.180 --> 28:28.281
<i> I thought</i>
<i> Shelby was messing with me.</i>

28:34.790 --> 28:36.790
Why, Shelby?

28:36.792 --> 28:39.392
Why would you do
something like that, huh?
Do something like what?

28:39.394 --> 28:42.128
This. Why would you do this?

28:42.130 --> 28:43.863
I didn't do anything.

28:43.865 --> 28:46.366
And I certainly didn't finish
off that wine, so maybe

28:46.368 --> 28:49.035
you're the one seeing things.
Wait a minute. Hold up.
I'm seeing things?

28:49.037 --> 28:51.204
The reason
I'm out here

28:51.206 --> 28:53.106
is because
of what you been seeing.

28:53.108 --> 28:54.941
(phone buzzing)
MATT:<i> My phone buzzed</i>
<i> around 11:30.</i>

28:54.943 --> 28:57.777
<i>I thought it was Shelby texting</i>
<i> to say good night,</i>

28:57.779 --> 28:59.879
<i> but it wasn't her.</i>

28:59.881 --> 29:01.815
It was an automated alert
from the security system

29:01.817 --> 29:03.316
I'd installed.

29:03.318 --> 29:06.086
<i> The sensors</i>
<i> had been triggered by...</i>

29:06.088 --> 29:07.387
<i> something.</i>

29:13.895 --> 29:16.396
(phone buzzing)
Well, bottles just don't roll
across the floor by themselves.

29:16.398 --> 29:18.398
Why you messin' with me?
For the last time,
I didn't do it!

29:18.400 --> 29:21.534
God, everything is a five-alarm
emergency with you.

29:34.082 --> 29:36.149
MATT:
<i> I was in a complete panic.</i>

29:36.151 --> 29:39.386
<i> My family was in danger,</i>
<i> and all I could do was watch.</i>

29:42.357 --> 29:44.157
<i> When a mob</i>

29:44.159 --> 29:45.825
shows up at your house
in the middle of the night

29:45.827 --> 29:47.594
with torches, they are not there

29:47.596 --> 29:49.629
to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

29:49.631 --> 29:52.165
(phone buzzing)
Do you know how many hours
Matt spends worrying about you?

29:52.167 --> 29:54.000
MATT:<i> And no one would pick up</i>
<i> the damn phone.</i>

29:54.002 --> 29:56.302
Every time you have
a problem, you call Matt.

29:56.304 --> 29:58.338
Your husband's mean to you,
you call Matt. You fall
Uh-huh.

29:58.340 --> 30:01.341
off the wagon,
you call Matt.
Well, that's what families do!

30:01.343 --> 30:03.643
We look out for each other!
Yeah, except
for you take.

30:03.645 --> 30:05.645
You take and you take.
Where were you

30:05.647 --> 30:07.847
when Matt was lying in
that hospital room, unconscious,

30:07.849 --> 30:09.616
fighting for his life?
Where were you...
(door opens)

30:09.618 --> 30:11.685
(shushing)

30:11.687 --> 30:14.821
(creaking)

30:14.823 --> 30:16.890
(whispering):
Someone's in the house.

30:18.894 --> 30:21.061

30:32.240 --> 30:35.875

30:42.417 --> 30:44.718
(man shouting)

30:44.720 --> 30:48.254
Hey, Lee, I'm not staying
up here by myself.

30:56.431 --> 30:57.997
Where's your gun?

30:57.999 --> 31:00.366
Where it should be,
locked,

31:00.368 --> 31:02.602
in a drawer upstairs.

31:02.604 --> 31:04.571
Do we need to go
back up and get it?
Shh.

31:04.573 --> 31:07.073
(man panting)

31:11.780 --> 31:15.248
(man whimpering)

31:23.358 --> 31:25.125
(man shouting)

31:33.268 --> 31:35.702
(man whimpering on TV)

31:35.704 --> 31:37.971
MAN:
I knew it... it came back.

31:37.973 --> 31:39.806
I knew it was real.

31:39.808 --> 31:42.575
SHELBY:
<i> Why would someone</i>
<i> break into my house</i>

31:42.577 --> 31:44.677
just to play a home movie?

31:46.715 --> 31:50.483
(inhuman howling on TV)

31:50.485 --> 31:51.918
Oh, God.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.720
I've heard those noises.

31:53.722 --> 31:57.223
(panting, mutters)

31:57.225 --> 31:58.591
It's close.

31:58.593 --> 32:00.794
(panting):
I can smell it.

32:05.801 --> 32:08.234
(inhuman howling, man yells)

32:08.236 --> 32:10.804
(man screaming,
howling continues)

32:12.407 --> 32:14.974
I finally got you,

32:14.976 --> 32:17.777
you son of a bitch.

32:17.779 --> 32:19.145
What the hell was that?

32:19.147 --> 32:20.580
I have no idea.

32:22.584 --> 32:24.584
We have to get
out of here. Come on.
Yeah.

32:24.586 --> 32:27.020
(door slams shut,
gasping, whimpering)

32:27.022 --> 32:28.988
(power whooshes off,
phone buzzes)

32:28.990 --> 32:30.990
MATT:
<i> I was freaking out.</i>

32:30.992 --> 32:32.659
I called the cops-- they said
they would look into it.

32:32.661 --> 32:34.093
Frigging useless!

32:34.095 --> 32:36.262
(yells)

32:36.264 --> 32:37.664
Shit! Shit!

32:37.666 --> 32:39.599
<i> I knew,</i>
<i> even 100 miles away,</i>

32:39.601 --> 32:41.835
<i> I'd get there</i>

32:41.837 --> 32:44.771
I just kept saying, "Please,
God, just-just get me home.

32:44.773 --> 32:46.806
Please just don't
let me be too late."

32:46.808 --> 32:49.342
(floorboards rattling)

32:49.344 --> 32:51.611
Someone's up there.
Shh.

32:51.613 --> 32:53.613
(floorboards rattling)

32:53.615 --> 32:55.615
(panting, gasping)

32:55.617 --> 32:59.052
A lot of someones.

32:59.054 --> 33:00.653
SHELBY:
<i> We were down there</i>

33:00.655 --> 33:03.323
20, maybe... 30 minutes,

33:03.325 --> 33:07.093
<i> but it felt like forever.</i>

33:08.897 --> 33:10.363
Come on.

33:10.365 --> 33:13.433
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Shh. Keep it down.

33:18.540 --> 33:23.109
(squeaking, banging,
rattling)

What are you doing?

33:42.264 --> 33:44.464
Shh.

34:43.591 --> 34:45.458
MATT:
<i> I finally arrived.</i>

34:45.460 --> 34:47.727
<i> The cops had come and gone</i>
<i> by the time I got there.</i>

34:47.729 --> 34:49.963
<i> Lee said they took a report</i>
<i>and chalked it up to vandalism.</i>

34:49.965 --> 34:51.397
<i> This was not vandalism.</i>

34:51.399 --> 34:52.832
This was terrorism.

34:52.834 --> 34:54.467
How'd they do this so quickly?

34:54.469 --> 34:55.735
SHELBY:
That's not the point, Matt.

34:56.938 --> 34:58.071
They broke into our home.

34:59.274 --> 35:01.341
They locked your sister

35:01.343 --> 35:04.911
and me in the basement.
They were here.

35:04.913 --> 35:07.947
They lured us down there,
made us watch

35:07.949 --> 35:09.582
this creepy video.

35:09.584 --> 35:11.150
What video?

35:11.152 --> 35:13.586
SHELBY:
<i> I didn't want to see it again,</i>

35:13.588 --> 35:15.288
but I went down with him anyway

35:15.290 --> 35:17.824
because I wasn't going
to be alone in that house.

35:17.826 --> 35:21.361
<i> Matt hadn't been there</i>
<i> when it happened, so,</i>

35:21.363 --> 35:24.163
<i> of course</i>
<i> he didn't take it seriously.</i>

35:24.165 --> 35:25.665
MATT:
<i> I took it seriously.</i>

35:25.667 --> 35:27.500
I mean, I thought
the video was fake.

35:27.502 --> 35:29.635
(man yelling)

35:29.637 --> 35:31.771
<i> Had to be those rednecks</i>
<i> going all out,</i>

35:31.773 --> 35:33.272

35:33.274 --> 35:34.841

35:40.648 --> 35:44.650
I finally got you,
you son of a bitch.

35:44.652 --> 35:45.785
MATT:
<i> Pissed me off even more.</i>

35:48.390 --> 35:50.723
People do this
all the time.

35:50.725 --> 35:53.026
Neighbors or locals
do crazy things

35:53.028 --> 35:55.695
to try to drive out
the new homeowners,

35:55.697 --> 35:57.497
so they can come in and
buy the property cheap.

35:57.499 --> 36:00.700
They're just trying to freak
us out so that we'll leave.

36:00.702 --> 36:02.368
Well, it's working.

36:02.370 --> 36:03.803
I want to leave, Matt.

36:03.805 --> 36:06.239
Now.

36:06.241 --> 36:09.709
If they want the house that
badly, let them have it.

36:09.711 --> 36:10.877
Did the cops see these tapes?

36:10.879 --> 36:12.812
Yeah.
SHELBY:
They don't care.

36:12.814 --> 36:16.149
They just think it's some good
ol' boys being good ol' boys.

36:16.151 --> 36:18.217
You know they're not gonna lift
a goddamn finger to help us.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.752
LEE: Come on, Shelby,
Shelby, come on.

36:19.754 --> 36:22.555
You got to let the
cops do their job.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.223
Oh, don't take this personally.

36:28.096 --> 36:30.329
Matt.

36:30.331 --> 36:31.864
We have to leave.

36:31.866 --> 36:34.167
It's our home, Shel.

36:34.169 --> 36:35.435
Our life savings.

36:35.437 --> 36:36.536
Where are we gonna go?

36:36.538 --> 36:37.737
And with what?

36:37.739 --> 36:38.771
You cannot let these people

36:38.773 --> 36:40.907
run you out of your home.

36:43.211 --> 36:45.778
You're not even
listening to me.

36:45.780 --> 36:47.613
Wow.

36:47.615 --> 36:49.182
You know what?

36:49.184 --> 36:52.885
Just...
just do what you want.

36:52.887 --> 36:54.720
Shelby?
LEE:
Oh, let her go.

36:54.722 --> 36:56.756
Give her a little time
to calm down.

37:00.728 --> 37:02.895
(door slams)

37:02.897 --> 37:04.564
Who is this guy?

37:04.566 --> 37:07.133
LEE: Another member
of that redneck family?

37:07.135 --> 37:10.269

37:10.271 --> 37:11.971

There's no shame in getting
