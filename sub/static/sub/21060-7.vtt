-Stop! Now! Stop!

-Heads up!

-* Bad boys, bad boys,

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.233 --> 00:30.433
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:41.400
in a court of law.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.900
-I work for the Neighborhood
Response Squad.

00:44.933 --> 00:49.533
Our main focus is gangs
and drugs that plague our city.

00:49.567 --> 00:53.033
Um, I work out a lot.
I like to play sports.

00:53.067 --> 00:56.867
You know, stayin' in shape
is a main thing
with bein' a cop.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.067
You gotta be able
to hold your own, uh,

01:00.067 --> 01:03.333
whether it's a foot chase,
or somebody that just wants
to turn around

01:03.367 --> 01:05.067
and go toe-to-toe with you.

01:05.067 --> 01:09.367
Uh, and that happens
from time to time.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.200
-We're gonna go out
with these guys over here.

01:11.233 --> 01:12.867
It looks like
they're loitering,

01:12.900 --> 01:15.600
possibly trespassing behind
this convenience store here.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.200
-Lewis: How we doin', gentlemen?

01:19.233 --> 01:20.500
Hey, come here.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.300
-Tolbert:
Oop, he's takin' off runnin'.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.067
Hey, he's takin' off runnin'.

01:24.067 --> 01:27.633
-(car doors closing)

01:27.667 --> 01:30.100
-North 21.
-(siren yelps)

01:30.133 --> 01:31.833
-(indistinct radio response)

01:33.933 --> 01:35.367
-(siren yelps)

01:35.400 --> 01:37.667
-Tolbert: There he goes.
-Lewis: He hopped the wall.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.767
-Radio operator:
Sorry, 21. Go ahead.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.200
-Tolbert:
60th and Bethany, just north.
We just had a Hispanic male,

01:44.233 --> 01:48.100
red Cardinals jacket, red hat,
just took off running.

01:52.533 --> 01:56.100
Let's go and, uh,
set a perimeter at...
60th and Bethany,

01:56.133 --> 01:58.267
61st and Bethany, and, uh...

01:58.300 --> 02:01.067
-Lewis: There he is.
-...at Rose.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.300
-(siren yelps)
-(indistinct radio response)

02:03.333 --> 02:06.333
-Tolbert: Police!
Stop running!

02:06.367 --> 02:09.267
-Lewis: Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

02:09.300 --> 02:11.467
-(Taser crackling)

02:11.500 --> 02:13.800
-(officers panting)

02:13.833 --> 02:16.167
-Lewis: Police! Stop running!

02:16.200 --> 02:17.533
Get on the ground, right now!

02:17.567 --> 02:18.800
-(man grunts)

02:18.833 --> 02:20.067
-Lewis:
Get on the ground right now!

02:20.100 --> 02:21.733
-(man screaming)

02:21.767 --> 02:23.867
-Lewis: Put your hands
behind your back.
-Tolbert: Hold traffic.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.200
-Lewis: Put your hands
behind your back!

02:25.233 --> 02:26.767
Put your hands
behind your back!

02:26.800 --> 02:29.067
-Tolbert: Put your head down!
-Lewis: Put your hands
behind your back!

02:29.100 --> 02:32.633
-(panting)

02:32.667 --> 02:34.933
-Tolbert: My double cuffs.

02:40.633 --> 02:42.867
-Got any weapons on you?
-No.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.067
-(man groans)
-Tolbert: What is your name?

02:45.067 --> 02:48.933
-(man groaning)

02:48.967 --> 02:51.167
-Lewis: He's got needles.
-Tolbert: Huh?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.067
-Lewis: Needles.
-How many needles
do you have on you?

02:53.067 --> 02:54.533
I don't wanna get stuck
by your dirty needles.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.267
-Man: I think just two or three.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.967
-The sorry mother hit me.
-Tolbert: Well, why did you run?

03:03.067 --> 03:05.533
-Lewis: Yeah?
-'Cause I got a warrant.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.600
Gonna press charges
on you (bleep).

03:07.633 --> 03:09.367
-Tolbert: Yeah, it's in here.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.800
Man: I wanna talk
to your sergeant, dude.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.767
-Officers:
He's standin' right there.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.467
-Man: You had no reason
to hit me, dude.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.600
-Lewis: You should've listened.
-Not while I'm on the ground.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.067
-Lewis:
You should've listened, huh?

03:18.067 --> 03:20.067
-Yeah, you ain't got no reason
to punch me, though.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.767
-Tolbert: Ready?
Gonna lift you up.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.233
-(man groaning)

03:25.267 --> 03:27.433
-All right, come on, walk.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.500
-Man: Damn, woman.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.367
-Tolbert: You weren't sellin'
any drugs over here,
were you?

03:33.400 --> 03:34.833
-Man: Oh, no, no, no.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.867
-Tolbert: All right.
How many needles
do you think you had on you?

03:36.900 --> 03:38.967
-Man: Uh, just two.
Uh, just two.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.467
-(man groans)
-Tolbert: Come over here.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.900
-Lewis:
Come on, stand up.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.867
-Man: Hold that.
I'm trying to...

03:45.933 --> 03:48.900
Goddamn, dude.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.900
-Hey, you know,
I'm real concerned, you know,

03:50.933 --> 03:52.600
there's a lot of kids
that live in this area, okay?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.500
And when you took off running,
you hopped that one fence,

03:54.533 --> 03:56.900
and then, you were
about to hop another fence.

03:56.933 --> 03:59.867
I just wanna make sure there's
no dope layin' anywhere that
a kid's gonna get that, okay?

03:59.900 --> 04:02.067
So did you drop any dope,
or anything like that?

04:02.100 --> 04:05.600
-No, the only--
No, I did my shot
a little bit before

04:05.633 --> 04:08.500
-you guys even... caught--
-How long before?

04:08.533 --> 04:10.733
-Probably
like 10 minutes before.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.833
-Is it heroin or meth?
-Heroin.

04:12.867 --> 04:15.267
-Heroin?
How long you been usin'?

04:15.300 --> 04:18.500
-Since basically '06.
But it's like on and off,
you know what I mean?

04:18.533 --> 04:22.067
-Right. How long you been out?
-Uh, four years.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.367
-Four years. Okay.
-Yeah.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.200
-You been usin' ever since
you been out?

04:26.233 --> 04:28.567
-On and off.
-Yeah. Okay.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.500
-What's the whole point
of punchin' me in my head for?

04:32.533 --> 04:34.933
-Well, you gotta see it
from our point of view, right?

04:34.967 --> 04:37.933
Like, before
we could even talk to you,
you took off running.

04:37.967 --> 04:40.467
-But that's still no reason--
-We couldn't see your hands.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.967
So what would you think--
-I was tryin' to give you
my guys's hands, but--

04:44.067 --> 04:45.667
-Not at first, and you were
wearing that jacket,

04:45.700 --> 04:47.800
your hands were in front of you,
I couldn't see your hands.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.533
I'm thinkin', this guy
might have a gun,
this guy's gonna have a weapon.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.267
This guy's gonna try to hurt us.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.900
He's not stopping
and we're telling him to stop.

04:54.933 --> 04:56.833
You were bein' non-compliant.

04:58.933 --> 05:01.367
So... All right, you said
you're good, right?

05:01.400 --> 05:04.733
You don't need
the fire department
to come check you out?

05:04.767 --> 05:05.833
All right.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.633
All right, he's gonna
take you down.

05:07.667 --> 05:10.700
Um, is it a 51?
-No, it's just a Glendale.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.633
-Tolbert: You just had
a Glendale misdemeanor warrant.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.633
If you were cool, we probably
wouldn't even have taken you,

05:15.667 --> 05:18.067
'cause we're lookin'
for somethin' way
bigger than that.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.533
-Even though, still,
you guys are gonna take me,
I know this regardless.

05:21.567 --> 05:22.900
You guys are still
gonna take me to jail.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.500
-Tolbert: Okay, you're goin'
to jail either way,

05:24.533 --> 05:27.300
and you would've been out
by in the morning.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.933
Holy cow.
It would've been at least
a place for you to stay.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.733
You wouldn't have had
to stay on the street.

05:32.767 --> 05:37.200
All of that for a misdemeanor
warrant, that's silly.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.500
Okay. You know it's
against the law to possess
drug paraphernalia

05:39.533 --> 05:43.100
in the State of Arizona?

05:43.133 --> 05:45.367
-No, I didn't know that.
-You didn't know that?

05:45.400 --> 05:46.967
Wow, all this time
you're using heroin,

05:47.067 --> 05:49.333
you didn't know
that's against the law?

05:49.367 --> 05:51.200
Hm. Well, now you know
I guess, huh?

05:51.233 --> 05:55.167
All right. Again, if anything
was missed, anything
in your undies,

05:55.200 --> 05:56.833
make sure you
let Officer Pittman know, okay?

05:56.867 --> 05:58.867
If you take anything
into our jail, it's
an additional felony.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.167
-I know.
-All right?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.500
Oh, you know that one, though.
All right.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.833
Good luck to you.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.833
-So he ran just
for a misdemeanor warrant?

06:07.867 --> 06:10.100
-Right.
-Creating this whole incident?

06:10.133 --> 06:11.200
-Seems pretty silly.

06:11.233 --> 06:13.733
-Okay.
Any drugs found on him?

06:13.767 --> 06:15.633
-No. He admitted that,
uh, just up the street,

06:15.667 --> 06:17.767
at Bonsall Park,
that he had just used heroin.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.967
That he, uh, shot up heroin
at the park, came over here
to visit with some buddies.

06:22.067 --> 06:27.533
Um, we let him know that
there's a trespass order,
uh, in effect for that business,

06:27.567 --> 06:29.600
and that he knew
he had a warrant.

06:29.633 --> 06:33.267
-Usually when they get
the heroin, they use it
as fast as possible, so.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.400
-Lewis: I think it's safe to say
that the group that he was with
over there has already left.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.333
-Okay.
Well, good job, guys.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.167
-Lewis: Hey, man, how you doin'?
-Boosh.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.133
-Hey, you know what you're bein'
booked for tonight, right?

06:44.167 --> 06:45.567
We already told you that?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.967
You're gonna go for trespassing,

06:48.067 --> 06:52.800
uh... resisting,
and obstructing.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.067
-All right?
-Okay.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.733
-Do you have any questions?
-No.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.867
-All right, man.
Good luck.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.067
-(door shuts)

07:04.767 --> 07:06.567
-The STAR team is a burglary
suppression unit.

07:06.600 --> 07:11.133
We basically flood areas
that we're havin' issues in
and try to, uh, disrupt crime.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.200
We have the luxury to be
proactive and get a lot of drugs

07:14.233 --> 07:17.100
and people that are wreakin'
havoc in our areas.

07:17.133 --> 07:20.567
I find that fun,
just to be able to...
to play that game, I guess,

07:20.600 --> 07:24.233
to go in an area
and take out the bad folks.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.267
Trying to catch up
to this vehicle here.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.533
The tag came back
to a different vehicle

07:28.567 --> 07:30.500
and also has a couple
of equipment violations.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.633
What's up with that tag?
It doesn't belong on the car,
it seems like.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.433
You have a driver's license?
-Yeah, but I don't have
my wallet.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.767
-Valid?
-Yeah.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.333
-Out of where, here?
-Yeah, Florida.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.833
But my tag's an Ohio tag.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.567
-So why is that tag on it?
-I have no idea.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.933
I haven't drove the truck
for a week or two.

07:53.967 --> 07:56.333
-What's your name, boss?
-Eric.

07:56.367 --> 07:57.800
-Hey, you have ID, ma'am?

08:02.333 --> 08:05.467
Is the truck registered or--?
-Eric: Uh, yeah, it is.
It's registered.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.167
It's my uncle's truck,
but I'm in the process
of buying it.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.700
-Okay.
-Yeah, I'm in the process
of buying it.

08:10.733 --> 08:13.633
-Can you just come over here
and sit on the bumper here?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.067
Just turn around.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.700
Hey, Eric, just turn around
and face me.

08:17.733 --> 08:20.300
Just face me, okay?
Just turn around and face me,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.167
and stop messin' with
whatever you're messin' with.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.333
What are you puttin' back here?

08:26.367 --> 08:28.300
-Excuse me?
-What are you puttin'
back there?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.067
-I didn't put anything anywhere.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.800
-Okay, but what are you just
diggin' for down there?

08:33.833 --> 08:35.700
-Nothing, sir.
-No, no, in the--

08:35.733 --> 08:37.967
-Eric: Just leaned over
the back of the truck, sir.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.300
-Morris: Turn around.
-Eric: I put my keys in there,
that might've been

08:40.333 --> 08:42.600
what you heard.
-Morris: No, it's that bag
that you just dropped

08:42.633 --> 08:44.267
on the ground.
I can smell the weed.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.700
-Woman: Look, sir,
I don't have anything.
-No, no. I don't want games.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.233
Okay? We can be honest
wtih each other,

08:48.267 --> 08:52.300
we can be adults,
and that's about it.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.767
But you wanna start
playin' games...

08:58.400 --> 09:00.067
Do you have anything else
on you at all?

09:00.067 --> 09:01.067
-No, sir.
-Huh?

09:01.100 --> 09:02.700
-No, sir.
-Okay.

09:02.733 --> 09:06.067
-All right, come sit back here.
Away from that.
Just sit back there.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.733
Do you have anything on you,
knives or anything like that?

09:09.767 --> 09:11.500
-No. No.
-Can you turn around,
so I can make sure?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.967
-Actually, yes, I do.
Uh, sir, I've got a syringe
in my front pocket.

09:14.067 --> 09:17.500
-Okay. Is it capped?
-Uh, it is capped, yes,
it does have a cap on it.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.833
-Okay, can you
just grab it out for me?
-Yes, sir.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.933
Here. And a spoon.

09:22.967 --> 09:25.333
-And a bag?
All right, just put it
right down there.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.633
Is that methamphetamines?
-Yes, sir.

09:29.467 --> 09:32.700
-Woman: I did not drop
anything from anywhere,
I promise.

09:32.733 --> 09:35.267
-Well, you just dropped
a bag of weed on there,
on the ground, didn't you?

09:35.300 --> 09:37.333
-Woman:
That was not my-- No.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.800
No, I just... (whimpers)

09:39.833 --> 09:41.800
-Just have a seat
for right now, okay?

09:43.367 --> 09:46.067
-Go ahead and put
your hands behind your back.
-Yes, sir.

09:46.067 --> 09:49.800
-Woman: Sir? He's my friend,
he came and picked me up
from my house, you know?

09:49.833 --> 09:54.200
I have kids.
We were going out
to have a good time,

09:54.233 --> 09:57.333
just he and I, you know,
whatever, we were... you know.

09:57.367 --> 10:00.233
-But you just said
you had a husband and kids.

10:00.267 --> 10:05.367
-That's what I mean, sir.
I wasn't supposed to be,
you know, out with him.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.167
But I didn't know
that all this other (bleep)
went along with it.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.867
-All right.
Just hang out for a second,
all right?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.767
I'll be back to talk with you.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.800
Looks like, uh, roaches
of marijuana, but then
inside that bag,

10:16.833 --> 10:22.700
there was some more pills.
Looks like some, uh, Xanax
pills and...

10:22.733 --> 10:25.633
it seems like a little,
uh, party pack.

10:26.967 --> 10:30.367
-I got meth
on the passenger side.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.367
-Morris:
Suspected methamphetamines.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.333
-There's a pipe in her shoe.

10:41.633 --> 10:44.133
-Hey, Eric.
That bag of marijuana
that was on the ground?

10:44.167 --> 10:45.933
-Yes.
-Did that come from you
or did she drop it?

10:45.967 --> 10:48.200
-That was me.
I brought everything,
'cause, you know,

10:48.233 --> 10:50.400
I-- I brought the drugs.

10:50.433 --> 10:53.533
-So the other thing is,
there's a little meth pipe
and a bag of meth

10:53.567 --> 10:56.767
on the floorboard there.
Does that ring a bell to you?
For anything?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.633
-No, I mean, it could be
anybody's.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.533
-'Cause, I mean,
if you just knew--

11:01.567 --> 11:04.300
I mean, people use the truck
on a daily basis.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.400
-Yeah, I mean,
I understand people, uh,

11:06.433 --> 11:10.767
you know, they leave shoes
or shirts or somethin',
or there's somethin' in the car,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.867
but a pretty good-sized
bag of meth, people
aren't just leavin' it--

11:13.900 --> 11:16.467
you know what I mean?
-Yeah, you'd be surprised
what I found in this car.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.267
-No... (laughs)
well, not that kind--
Maybe some residue stuff,

11:19.300 --> 11:21.633
but not a decent-sized
bag like that.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.633
-No, that's crazy.
That sounds crazy.
-(Morris laughs)

11:24.667 --> 11:26.933
-Okay. All right.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.800
All right, everything good
and comfortable?
-Woman: Yeah.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.867
-As comfortable as can be?

11:34.900 --> 11:37.167
-Am I free to go,
or what's going on?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.800
-No.
-Why?

11:38.833 --> 11:42.100
-Well, underneath
all your clothes, there's
a bag of meth,

11:42.133 --> 11:43.500
and there's a meth pipe.

11:43.533 --> 11:46.500
-(bleep) that (bleep), man.

11:46.533 --> 11:49.233
-Eric took everything else,
he took the marijuana that was--

11:49.267 --> 11:52.600
-You don't understand
all the (bleep) I've been
through with goddamn dope,

11:52.633 --> 11:54.233
okay?
-Okay.

11:54.267 --> 11:59.833
-I... Look. Anything that was
mine would've been on me,
in my possession.

11:59.867 --> 12:03.467
-Okay.
-I don't understand
how I'm getting in trouble

12:03.500 --> 12:05.433
for something that isn't mine.

12:05.467 --> 12:07.667
-Well, that's how it's
gonna happen tonight.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.133
-I'm gonna fight
this in court.
-Okay.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.933
-I mean, possession
is nine-tenths of the law.

12:11.967 --> 12:15.200
I don't even have possession,
and I was-- nothing was mine.

12:15.233 --> 12:18.533
-Listen, and I'll show up,
and he'll show up,
and he'll give his side

12:18.567 --> 12:21.433
of the story,
and obviously,
we all wear cameras,

12:21.467 --> 12:25.067
and it is what it is.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.533
-Hey, Eric, when you guys
were out earlier,

12:26.567 --> 12:29.267
you and her, when you said
you shot up earlier,

12:29.300 --> 12:30.867
how long ago was that,
do you remember?

12:30.900 --> 12:33.267
I have no idea.
I can't comprehend time
right now.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.400
Probably, a few hours...
-No, you can't, my friend.

12:35.433 --> 12:38.267
-No, sir.
-Listen, from the time
I talked to you,

12:38.300 --> 12:42.067
15 minutes ago till now,
you are out of your mind, bro.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.067
-All right.
-Aren't you?

12:44.067 --> 12:46.733
-Yes. Pretty much.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.733
-Galassi: Do me a favor.
Turn around, face me.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.900
Turn around, face me.

12:50.933 --> 12:53.133
Have a seat.
Slide back, okay?

12:53.167 --> 12:55.900
-Eric, he's saying
that the drugs are mine!

12:55.933 --> 12:58.367
Baby, that ain't... (sobs)

12:58.400 --> 13:01.133
-Morris: All right.
Eric, as of right now,
you're going to jail

13:01.167 --> 13:03.533
for a couple of possession
of controlled substances...
-(crying): Eric.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.700
-Morris:
...and the methamphetamine
and the marijuana...

13:05.733 --> 13:08.600
-(crying): Eric, goddamn it.
-Morris: ...and drivin' with
a suspended license.

13:08.633 --> 13:11.200
-Karlyn, you're going to jail
for the methamphetamine
possession...

13:11.233 --> 13:13.067
-Eric!
-...and the paraphernalia, okay?

13:13.067 --> 13:16.067
-Eric, that's not fair, baby,
that's not my drugs!

13:17.633 --> 13:19.800
-Morris: Sometimes you
get caught, sometimes
you get away with it.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.100
Tonight, we got caught.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.767
-Prior to becomin' a cop,
I was, uh, in the Army
for eight years,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.300
and when I got out
of the Army,

13:28.333 --> 13:31.400
I decided to do this job
because it was a natural
transition for me.

13:31.433 --> 13:34.267
And over the last 12 years,
I spent seven years
of my career

13:34.300 --> 13:37.867
in our narcotics division.
And a good night for me
would be gettin' some dope

13:37.900 --> 13:42.867
off the street, to know that
that dope's not gettin'
to some child in the homes.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.733
We, uh, received a call,
a white car with a black male
driver and a white female,

13:46.767 --> 13:48.833
went and knocked
on a door naked.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.867
Right now, we're gonna do
a traffic stop on this vehicle.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.133
It came out of the area
doin', uh, 45 in a 35.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.100
-(indistinct radio chatter)

13:57.133 --> 13:59.133
-(siren yelps)

13:59.167 --> 14:02.500
-(indistinct radio chatter)

14:02.533 --> 14:04.733
-(dog barking nearby)

14:06.967 --> 14:08.600
-Man: The window doesn't work.
-(knocks on window)

14:08.633 --> 14:11.633
-All right, can I
open the door? Huh?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.533
-No, sir.
-Well, I gotta talk to you.

14:13.567 --> 14:17.633
-Why?
-Why? 'Cause I'm doin' a traffic
stop on you, my man.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.600
-Okay, can I give you
my license and--

14:19.633 --> 14:21.900
-Yeah. Where's your license at?
-In my pocket.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.233
-Baltes: We got a call
about a black male
and a white female

14:24.267 --> 14:26.933
runnin' around,
knockin' on a neighbor's
door with no clothes on?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.333
-Woman: I did that.
-Baltes: Okay.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.933
-Woman: A guy called me,
a friend of mine...

14:29.967 --> 14:32.200
-All right. Come on out here.
-...and he gave me
the wrong house number.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.567
-All right, go back there
with him, he's gonna
check you real quick.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.500
Okay, so, hold on
a second, let me--
-He's a friend of mine, so...

14:37.533 --> 14:38.933
-Let me get this right.
-Right.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.567
-So, a guy called you
to come hang out...

14:40.600 --> 14:42.867
-Right.
-...and he said, come knock
on the door naked--

14:42.900 --> 14:46.067
-Naked 'cause he wanted...
you know?
-So you did, and it ended up

14:46.100 --> 14:47.900
bein' the wrong house number?

14:47.933 --> 14:51.500
-No, the, uh-- Someone
from the other house saw me,
I guess.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.867
-But I mean-- So you went
and knocked on the door
naked, for real?

14:53.900 --> 14:57.500
-Ray-- Yeah, I mean, it was
dark at his house, you know,
it didn't matter.

14:57.533 --> 15:01.067
So I did that. You know?
-And it was the wrong house,
he set you up?

15:01.100 --> 15:03.800
-Maybe he did that.
You know what I'm saying?
It's crazy.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.667
-Okay.
-But everything is good,
it's like, ridiculous.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.200
We were gonna go hang out
for the night-- I was gonna
go hang over the night.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.433
He was gonna drop me off.
But now I called him,
I said forget that,

15:11.467 --> 15:13.467
it's ridiculous.
'Cause now there's people

15:13.500 --> 15:15.300
out in the parking lot,
telling me to get the hell out,

15:15.333 --> 15:16.700
we don't belong there,
'cause we don't.

15:16.733 --> 15:18.200
-Right.
-You know, and--

15:18.233 --> 15:20.067
-Okay, so the people
weren't lyin' to us
when they were like,

15:20.100 --> 15:22.867
hey, this white female
is naked.
-I know it's ridiculous,

15:22.900 --> 15:25.333
it's stupid, but he has
a little fetish, he wants
to hang out for the night

15:25.367 --> 15:26.867
with me.
I do this all the time with him.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.567
-How do you know this guy?
-This guy? He's a friend
of mine.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.800
It wasn't his thing.
-Step out here real quick
and sit with your buddy.

15:32.833 --> 15:36.067
Marlon, let's talk
for a minute, come
over here.

15:36.067 --> 15:39.733
Somebody called and said
that a white girl came out
of your car,

15:39.767 --> 15:42.167
went up to the door,
was naked.
-That happened.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.433
Yeah, it did happen.
-Tell me about that.

15:44.467 --> 15:47.167
-She told me she had
to go out to a friend's house,

15:47.200 --> 15:51.067
her boyfriend,
and they were on the phone
flirting, and he was like,

15:51.067 --> 15:53.367
you better show up
in some lingerie, or,
matter of fact,

15:53.400 --> 15:55.167
you better be naked.
-Right.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
-'Cause I wanna see you naked
when you walk through the door.

15:57.233 --> 15:59.267
And I'm like, I'm lookin'
at her like--
-So you gave her a ride

15:59.300 --> 16:03.433
to pull a trick?
-No, I don't know
what the hell she's doin'.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.133
-How do you know her?
-Carla, she lives on--

16:06.167 --> 16:07.700
-But I mean, how do you
know her know her?

16:07.733 --> 16:10.167
-She's a friend of a friend.
So I don't really know her.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.100
She just called me
because she knew
I have a car

16:12.133 --> 16:13.533
and I could give her
a ride someplace.

16:13.567 --> 16:14.933
-Was she gonna pay you
to give her a ride?

16:14.967 --> 16:16.367
She already gave me 10 bucks.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.733
-Right.
-I was like, whatever,
I'll give you a ride.

16:18.767 --> 16:20.100
'Cause I have to go
somewhere anyways.

16:20.133 --> 16:22.600
-So you were intendin'
to drop her off and leave?
-Yeah.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.300
-Or wait around till
whenever she was done?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.500
-She doesn't tell me
her personal business,
I don't know her like that.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.533
-Okay.
-So that's what she was gonna
go do at that guy's house.

16:29.567 --> 16:33.633
-That's why, what?
-I don't know what the hell
she was doin'.

16:33.667 --> 16:37.067
-Marlon, check this out.
Now it's time to be honest
with me.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.100
-What is that?
-Really, dude?

16:39.133 --> 16:40.900
-I didn't put that there.
-Really?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.067
-I saw it, I didn't
put it there.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.333
-I'm just as slick
as you are, player.

16:43.367 --> 16:46.333
-I'm bein' honest with you.
I did not put that there.

16:46.367 --> 16:47.733
-All right.

16:49.667 --> 16:52.533
I'm not playin' games
here, dude.
-I did not put that there.

16:52.567 --> 16:55.400
I swear to God on my life.
I did not put that there.

16:55.433 --> 16:58.600
Sir? On my mother's life.
My mother's a cancer patient.

16:58.633 --> 17:00.200
-Why would you--
Why would you even say that?

17:00.233 --> 17:02.133
-I'm bein' honest with you.
-Have a seat.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.467
-Yes, sir.
-Carla, come over here.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.933
-You know, it sounds like
to me, like this dude's
your pimp,

17:06.967 --> 17:08.600
givin' you a ride.
-Hell, no.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.233
-You sure about that?
-Absolute-- I promise you,
on my daughter's life,

17:11.267 --> 17:13.100
she'd die right now,
swear to God.
-Well, don't do that.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.533
-Because he's not.
He's a good friend of mine,
he's a good kid.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.833
He's very, very good.
I promise you.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.667
-He got a bag of dope
over there.
-Right.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.367
-You know what I mean?
Do you have any weed on you?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.467
-I have nothing on me
at all. I don't even smoke.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.400
-Okay. Well, do you have
an opiate problem?

17:26.433 --> 17:29.400
-I've had in the past.
-Okay. Well, I just--
I see scars on your arms

17:29.433 --> 17:31.167
and stuff.
-Well, yeah, they're from--
yeah, the past.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.533
I've been like
three months clean.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.367
You know what I'm sayin'?
-Three months clean?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.367
-I have nothing with me,
I don't carry drugs on me.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.133
-Okay.
-Here and there I might fall
a little bit,

17:38.167 --> 17:40.067
but that's about it.
-Okay.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.467
-I mean--
-Are you a working girl?

17:41.500 --> 17:44.067
-No, I'm not a working girl.
I used to be.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.833
I was arrested twice
for prostitution charges,

17:45.867 --> 17:47.567
and after that I cut it off.
That's all.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.400
Like, I do not even smoke weed.
-Okay. Have a seat again,
please, thank you.

17:51.433 --> 17:54.067
-Sir, I'm gonna be honest
with you. I found it.

17:54.067 --> 17:57.267
-Okay, so you found the dope
somewhere and you put it
in your pant leg.

17:57.300 --> 18:01.300
-Right.
I figured I could...
I don't know.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.333
-Flip it or something?

18:02.367 --> 18:05.567
-No. I was gonna
give it away to somebody.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.800
I don't do it.
I don't do those drugs.
I smoke weed.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.700
-Right.
-I don't know what it is.

18:10.733 --> 18:14.800
-So this is just bad luck
that the one day you happen
to find some dope

18:14.833 --> 18:16.900
and roll it in your pant leg,
that we end up finding it.

18:16.933 --> 18:19.067
-I didn't even know
it was there.
I didn't put it there.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.967
'Cause if I would've rolled it--
-Hold on a second,
hold on a second.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.067
So you picked it up--
-Weeks ago.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.767
-Weeks ago.
So you had it at your house?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.400
And you put on these same pants
you wore the other night
that you put the dope

18:28.433 --> 18:30.967
in the pant leg?
Dude, that is some bad luck,
if that's the case.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.467
-No, (bleep).

18:33.500 --> 18:35.900
-Well, I mean, we're gonna
find out here in a minute.

18:35.933 --> 18:40.833
It's a crazy story.
-So now this is an opiate test.

18:40.867 --> 18:43.500
'Cause it looks like
there's broken up pills in here.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.633
-Baltes: If it comes back
as a felony-type dope,

18:45.667 --> 18:49.167
then I have no choice,
you know what I mean?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.533
-Albauer: When you break
the capsules, you're lookin'
for a quick change of colors,

18:52.567 --> 18:54.900
that's gonna be positive
for opiates.

18:54.933 --> 18:58.300
-Okay, Carla.
Your buddy's goin' to jail
for havin' a little bit

18:58.333 --> 19:02.167
of dope on him.
Um... and you're gettin'
a break tonight.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.500
-I appreciate it.
-Okay?

19:03.533 --> 19:05.700
-Honestly, I didn't know--
I feel bad.

19:05.733 --> 19:09.467
He'd probably did not--
I mean, he's a truthful kid.
-Huh?

19:09.500 --> 19:12.533
He's a good kid.
So I-- When he says
he doesn't have something,

19:12.567 --> 19:14.567
he probably didn't have it,
but who know-- I don't know.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.367
-Okay.
Keep-- Keep your shenanigans
inside the home.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.500
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Have a good night.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.400
-You too.
-Marlon, check this out.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.400
It's felony dope,
I gotta take you to jail for it.

19:24.433 --> 19:27.300
I just wanna make sure
you understand tonight--
-Yeah?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.767
what you bond is,
your bond's gonna be
$10,000.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.733
It's, uh, possession
of a controlled substance
because of the opiate.

19:34.767 --> 19:38.167
Okay? That was in your pant leg
that you put in there
from the other day

19:38.200 --> 19:40.800
that you found in the park,
and then you put on dirty jeans.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.067
You know what I mean?

19:42.067 --> 19:44.267
So, two lessons
to be learned here:

19:44.300 --> 19:47.433
don't pick up dope
in the roadway,
and don't wear dirty laundry.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.567
-I appreciate it.
-All right, man.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.667
-(door shuts)

19:49.700 --> 19:52.067
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.067
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.200
Cover is code three.

19:55.233 --> 19:58.200
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.333 --> 20:06.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.933 --> 20:12.267
-(theme music playing)
