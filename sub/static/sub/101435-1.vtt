04:26.683 --> 04:28.185
Babe!

04:28.319 --> 04:30.821
I thought you
weren't touching yourself?

04:30.955 --> 04:33.623
So what's this for?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.396
Babe, what
are you talking about?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.697
That's for my skin.

04:40.831 --> 04:44.502
It's got friggin' SPF in
it. I'm on the field for hours

04:44.667 --> 04:46.904
during practice and games. You
could you imagine what my skin

04:47.038 --> 04:49.507
would look like if I didn't
take take care of it, baby.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.342
It's part of my regimen.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.345
Oh my God, you wore it.

04:56.347 --> 05:00.418
Yeah. Yeah,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.319
I know what my guy likes.

05:03.087 --> 05:05.856
How
about I help you out.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.191
Yes.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.133
Come here.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.407
Oh, ok.

05:28.711 --> 05:29.914
God damnit, Mom!

05:30.047 --> 05:32.450
God, I told you to knock!

05:32.582 --> 05:37.254
If you don't want me barging
in, lock your door.

05:37.388 --> 05:39.423
Your door has a lock on it?

05:40.491 --> 05:45.196
Well. Yeah honey, Rustin
and Melanie are downstairs.

05:45.329 --> 05:46.696
Would you like
me to invite them up?

05:46.831 --> 05:48.731
Oh, shit!

05:48.866 --> 05:51.836
What's up guys?

05:53.104 --> 05:54.972
Sorry Mrs. Banks.

05:56.807 --> 05:59.176
Oh shit, you guys were

05:59.310 --> 06:01.278
playing dress up
when your mom walked in.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.081
Oh and a cheerleader outfit,
very nice.

06:04.215 --> 06:06.350
Oh,
how'd the audition go?

06:06.484 --> 06:08.953
Can I get you guys anything?

06:09.420 --> 06:12.456
Bye, Sarah.

06:12.823 --> 06:14.758
Fuck, your mom's hot, dude.

06:14.892 --> 06:16.393
We should get a picture of this.

06:16.527 --> 06:20.297
Ok, alright, and then I want my

06:20.431 --> 06:24.001
chin to look better so just
alright and uh Mel if you could

06:24.135 --> 06:25.870
lay across the
front of us, you know?

06:26.003 --> 06:27.805
Go fuck yourself Rustin.

06:27.938 --> 06:29.473
You
already took 30 pictures before

06:29.607 --> 06:32.009
we even got up the driveway. I'm
trying to be present in my life

06:32.143 --> 06:34.411
not document it
for a bunch of internet pervs.

06:34.545 --> 06:35.980
I'm sorry about that, babe.

06:36.113 --> 06:36.814
Ready?

06:36.947 --> 06:38.482
Nice.

06:38.616 --> 06:41.152
I get it. If my parents lived

06:41.285 --> 06:43.087
close to
campus I'd still be there.

06:43.220 --> 06:46.790
It beats the life of crippling
debt I'll amount between dorm

06:46.924 --> 06:48.759
costs and tuition by
the time we graduate.

06:51.295 --> 06:54.598
Chelsea posted a pic of the
Aggie Press review of Hairspray.

06:54.731 --> 06:58.002
Oh, she's a bitch! I was
supposed to have that part.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.839
Didn't you
like miss the audition?

07:02.439 --> 07:06.210
You know if I can speak
as the only working actor here,

07:06.343 --> 07:10.114
60% of great
acting is great hair, but

07:10.247 --> 07:12.783
the other 30% is
just showing up on time.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.218
Working actor?

07:14.351 --> 07:18.222
You landed one
non-union anti vaping commercial

07:18.355 --> 07:21.325
for a $500 buy out, and
now you're a working actor?

07:23.227 --> 07:27.598
It's my
life, and my lungs, and it's

07:27.730 --> 07:30.968
just not cool. Escape the vape.

07:31.835 --> 07:33.771
Your sister scares me bro.

07:33.904 --> 07:35.105
You have no idea.

07:38.842 --> 07:40.411
What the fuck.

07:41.679 --> 07:43.847
Ok guys, check this out. This is
that haunted corn maze thing in

07:43.981 --> 07:45.683
Davis Jamie Solis
was telling me about it.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.885
Yeah, it's
Fright Farm or something.

07:48.018 --> 07:50.287
We should
totally do this!

07:51.021 --> 07:53.424
I don't know. I
don't like the weird people

07:53.557 --> 07:54.858
touching you and shit.

07:54.992 --> 07:57.061
Seriously lotion boy?

07:57.194 --> 07:58.395
What else are we gonna do?

07:58.529 --> 08:00.164
Movie.

08:00.297 --> 08:03.133
Can we just do something
different for a change?

08:04.401 --> 08:05.369
Well, what do you mean?

08:06.370 --> 08:08.172
All we do is
either have someone buy us beer

08:08.305 --> 08:10.708
or go somewhere and play
drinking games. I mean, come on.

08:10.841 --> 08:13.510
Or we go to
the movies, or dinner.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.279
Ok, well it's a small town, it's

08:15.412 --> 08:17.248
not my fault we
are limited on options.

08:17.381 --> 08:20.284
We should totally do
this! It's only an hour away!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.519
Rustin
wants to, don't you.

08:23.287 --> 08:27.191
No. No I
don't think we should.

08:28.192 --> 08:29.126
Why?

08:29.260 --> 08:31.562
You guys, that place is bad,

08:31.695 --> 08:35.532
like very bad.

08:40.236 --> 08:42.339
People really got killed there.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.075
Nice try Macbeth!

08:45.209 --> 08:47.044
See
this is why you never get cast.

08:47.177 --> 08:49.146
Shut up Melanie! You
don't know! There's a lot of

08:49.280 --> 08:52.149
reasons I never get cast.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.351
It's true.

08:55.853 --> 08:58.155
Ok so like 15 years ago,

08:58.289 --> 09:02.192
before it was a haunt, this
satanic clan broke into one of

09:02.326 --> 09:04.695
the cornfields
and they set up this altar.

09:04.828 --> 09:06.997
They kidnapped a local
virgin girl and

09:07.131 --> 09:08.565
offered her up as sacrifice by

09:09.768 --> 09:13.370
systematically dissecting
her while she was still alive.

09:13.971 --> 09:18.175
By the time the cops got there,
the only thing left was this 11

09:18.309 --> 09:20.444
inch piece on her skin that
looked like it had been peeled

09:20.577 --> 09:22.746
off by some kind of
potato peeler or something.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.983
You are so full of shit.

09:26.116 --> 09:28.218
Fuck you.
It's true. It was on the news!

09:28.352 --> 09:30.587
The killer shot a
video and everything. Crazy.

09:30.721 --> 09:32.690
Let me see. Give it.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.724
Ok, here, look.

09:33.857 --> 09:34.992
Give it.

09:36.026 --> 09:38.862
I'll be right there.

09:44.635 --> 09:46.904
Rustin! God damn it!

09:47.037 --> 09:50.174
Alright, you little
bitches better sack up

09:50.307 --> 09:51.375
because we
are totally doing this.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.476
Whoa, Hey!

09:52.609 --> 09:54.945
Oh if
you're scared I totally get it.

09:55.079 --> 09:56.680
Shut up Melanie,
you know I'm not scared!

09:56.815 --> 09:58.749
I was the only one
at Brandon's 10th birthday to

09:58.882 --> 09:59.950
watch
all the Nightmare on Elm Streets

10:00.084 --> 10:01.385
and not even cover my eyes once.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.488
Whatever. I am in.

10:04.621 --> 10:06.123
You know,
guys please. Let's not be the

10:06.256 --> 10:07.826
group that all
does the "I'm in thing."

10:07.958 --> 10:10.127
I don't know. I am pretty sure
my girlfriend dressed up in this

10:10.260 --> 10:11.362
nice cheerleader outfit to...

10:11.495 --> 10:14.365
you know.
I'm pretty sure I'm in.

10:18.502 --> 10:20.270
Alright,
fuck! Fine, you guys want to

10:20.404 --> 10:22.406
hang out with a bunch of 10 year
olds, we'll go to the corn maze.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.042
Jesus. But
we're bringing your flask.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.643
Oh
hell yeah we bring my flask.

10:31.515 --> 10:33.617
Not my car.
I'm low on gas.

10:33.752 --> 10:35.052
Yeah, and drinking.

10:36.053 --> 10:36.788
No, we can take
my car, but you have to drive.

10:37.488 --> 10:39.089
What the fuck?

10:39.223 --> 10:40.759
Look Mel, we talked
about this. If you want to be a

10:40.891 --> 10:43.360
fucking nerd and not drink with
us that's fine, but you're gonna

10:43.494 --> 10:44.995
have to drive.
It's the right thing to do.

10:45.129 --> 10:46.029
Fuck off, Rustin.

10:46.163 --> 10:47.297
Oh hey, can we stop by my

10:47.431 --> 10:48.800
house on the
way so I can change?

10:48.932 --> 10:50.501
Babe,
you know you chose to wear this.

10:50.634 --> 10:54.338
Excuse me? You can't
expect me to go wearing this.

10:56.473 --> 10:57.641
Guys, ya know.

10:57.776 --> 10:59.778
No. 100% you're gonna wear that.

10:59.910 --> 11:00.812
Melanie.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.849
I'm sorry,
I'm with the guys on this one,

11:04.982 --> 11:06.617
it's way too good to pass up.

11:06.751 --> 11:07.752
Hey, sack up, right?

11:07.886 --> 11:10.220
I fucking hate you guys.

11:16.059 --> 11:18.797
Whoa, since
when do you carry a knife?

11:19.329 --> 11:21.398
Ever since
the Time's Up Movement started.

11:21.532 --> 11:24.836
If somebody fucks with me,
I am feeding them their balls.

11:25.302 --> 11:27.438
Jesus dude,
why are you always so angry?

11:27.571 --> 11:29.506
Whatever, I
think it's bad ass.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.574
You're awesome Mel!

11:30.707 --> 11:31.608
Thank you.

11:32.976 --> 11:34.111
You guys,
let's play a game.

11:34.244 --> 11:36.146
Oh yeah, how
about we play padiddle?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.748
What is padiddle?

11:37.882 --> 11:41.018
Padiddle, a game where
you see a car, the headlight is

11:41.151 --> 11:43.320
out, you have to be the first
person to go padiddle and if you

11:43.454 --> 11:44.823
are right, everybody in the car

11:44.955 --> 11:46.256
has to take off
an article of clothing.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.192
Gross, why do all your games end

11:48.325 --> 11:49.928
with me and my sister
getting naked together?

11:51.495 --> 11:54.731
Alright, let's play
two lies and a truth.

11:54.866 --> 11:58.202
Guys, let's not do the
expositional dialogue thing, ok?

11:58.335 --> 12:00.437
Let's just you two grope
each other in the back seat.

12:00.571 --> 12:02.973
We'll pretend it doesn't make us
very uncomfortable and we'll

12:03.106 --> 12:04.208
listen to music up here and

12:05.008 --> 12:05.777
we'll just
we'll drive. You know?

12:05.910 --> 12:06.643
Well that's cool.

12:06.778 --> 12:08.245
Sounds good.

12:35.974 --> 12:37.674
Alright everyone let's
settle down and let's get this

12:37.809 --> 12:40.611
safety meeting over with
so we can start our work day.

12:49.553 --> 12:54.324
It's another night,
and the season is almost over,

12:54.458 --> 12:57.094
so we've
got to keep our energy levels up

12:57.227 --> 12:59.329
and not make any
lazy mistakes out there.

12:59.463 --> 13:02.633
Remember we're a small business.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.434
A family business.

13:04.568 --> 13:07.538
So we've got
to work twice as hard to beat

13:07.671 --> 13:11.208
those strip mall pop up
haunts that have deep pockets.

13:11.341 --> 13:12.609
And you
know how we beat em?

13:12.743 --> 13:15.512
We beat them
with our hearts and our passion.

13:15.646 --> 13:19.316
Because we give our
customers an amazing experience,

13:19.449 --> 13:24.054
and we thrive,
thrive on word of mouth.

13:26.189 --> 13:30.795
Now boys, the
guests in the VIP maze,

13:31.461 --> 13:33.564
they need special attention.

13:33.697 --> 13:37.601
God Damnit Andy
get off your fucking phone!

13:41.839 --> 13:44.675
As I was saying, if
you have any questions just

13:44.809 --> 13:49.112
ask your sister. And can we
just-can we try, for the love of

13:49.246 --> 13:50.681
God to keep the mess down.

13:50.815 --> 13:52.416
Laundry ain't cheap.

13:52.749 --> 13:57.055
We got to keep costs
down to keep the doors open,

13:57.187 --> 13:59.222
to continue
your mother's legacy.

13:59.356 --> 14:03.226
Oh, and
brother Deacon was kind enough

14:03.360 --> 14:05.195
to bake some
peanut butter delights

14:05.329 --> 14:07.065
so make sure you
grab one on your way out.

14:07.197 --> 14:08.833
Oh and Deacon,

14:08.967 --> 14:12.804
they are very, very good.

14:13.805 --> 14:18.042
Ok...

14:18.175 --> 14:19.710
let's bring it in.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.953
Sweetie,

14:30.088 --> 14:34.491
I know you're
up there looking down upon us,

14:34.625 --> 14:38.128
so proud of the work we're doing

14:39.596 --> 14:42.466
and just know that there isn't a

14:42.599 --> 14:45.168
day that
goes by that we don't think

14:45.302 --> 14:46.470
of you and miss you.

14:49.073 --> 14:51.208
Sweetie, we
figured it out.

14:52.944 --> 14:54.711
We finally figured it out

14:57.015 --> 14:59.249
and everything is

14:59.383 --> 15:01.284
gonna change for the better.

15:03.021 --> 15:05.857
Your boys and little girl

15:07.058 --> 15:08.492
have grown up strong.

15:09.127 --> 15:11.495
Please watch over them

15:12.195 --> 15:14.832
and guide them as they

15:14.966 --> 15:16.266
continue your legacy.

15:19.569 --> 15:23.440
Just know
that we love you and miss you.

15:27.444 --> 15:32.150
Ok. Let's finish this.

15:40.892 --> 15:42.693
Don't forget your two for one

15:42.827 --> 15:47.297
combo with any
student ID at Fear Farm!

15:54.271 --> 15:57.108
Alright
guys, you're not listening.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.409
There's already
been a famous Justin.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.779
There's already
been a famous Dustin

16:01.913 --> 16:05.315
which means the world
is ready for a famous Rustin.

16:05.449 --> 16:07.185
Now I'm the most
popular Rustin on social media

16:07.317 --> 16:08.585
by almost 200 people.

16:08.753 --> 16:11.254
So when that
excellent opportunity meets my

16:11.722 --> 16:12.790
incredible online preparation,
I'm gonna break through to the

16:13.590 --> 16:14.158
big screen
and when that happens,

16:14.892 --> 16:15.559
what are
you gonna do, dude?

16:16.259 --> 16:17.260
Play professional soccer, ok?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.528
You
don't even look Italian.

16:18.662 --> 16:20.230
Bro you know
what? It can happen.

16:20.363 --> 16:21.398
Ok? I believe it.

16:21.531 --> 16:22.733
Yeah, baby.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.268
Dude, all I'm saying is
that any day now, they're gonna

16:25.702 --> 16:26.536
find me and they're gonna be
like oh my God, it's just what

16:26.670 --> 16:27.604
we've always wanted,

16:28.739 --> 16:29.406
another passibly handsome,
generic looking white guy.

16:29.539 --> 16:30.607
This is perfect.

16:31.708 --> 16:32.342
I'm gonna get a big
agent and it's gonna be crazy.

16:35.378 --> 16:37.148
Jesus, man!

16:37.782 --> 16:41.651
Hey aren't you the
"Escape the Vape" guy?

16:41.786 --> 16:44.287
Yeah.

16:45.056 --> 16:48.025
Yeah, come on let's
do this. Pull out your phone.

16:49.392 --> 16:50.594
What?

16:50.727 --> 16:51.996
Yeah, you
want a selfie, right?

16:52.130 --> 16:53.497
I'm sorry
dude, I don't do autographs.

16:53.630 --> 16:54.966
I don't want to
make a scene you know.

16:55.099 --> 16:56.000
Nah, I'm good.

16:57.135 --> 16:59.336
I mean I'll do it. We can
use my phone if you want.

16:59.469 --> 17:00.838
Alright Ryan
Gosling, let's move on.

17:01.538 --> 17:03.607
You really think I
look like Ryan Gosling?

17:03.740 --> 17:05.076
I've been
doing something with my hair.

17:05.209 --> 17:06.343
Absolutely not.

17:08.645 --> 17:10.446
I've gotta hit it
real quick before we go.

17:10.579 --> 17:12.116
I've gotta
piss like a race horse.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.152
Gross, dude. The only thing
I'm actually scared of here are

17:14.284 --> 17:15.551
those fucking porta potties.

17:15.853 --> 17:17.487
You know Becky Snyder
got crabs from one of those.

17:17.755 --> 17:19.356
Didn't you give Becky crabs?

17:19.489 --> 17:22.260
HA HA. No,
she gave me crabs. So-

17:22.392 --> 17:24.028
Ew. Fuck
Rustin, you have crabs?

17:24.162 --> 17:26.663
1 in 2 Americans are
gonna get an STD in their life.

17:26.798 --> 17:28.766
80% of those are
gonna get it in college.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.002
As someone who's almost
completed an entire semester of

17:31.135 --> 17:34.172
college 4 times, I'm still
well below the average 3.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.340
And yet I am still taking
a piss dude, so let's go.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.408
Ah, me too.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.777
What? You literally just said--

17:40.111 --> 17:41.913
Yeah dude, you can't get
crabs if you don't have pubes.

17:42.046 --> 17:43.915
Have fun.

17:44.048 --> 17:45.582
Hey I
thought you gave Becky crabs.

17:45.715 --> 17:47.952
God no. My ex McKenna did.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.334
So I read online
we gotta go to the south

18:04.467 --> 18:05.870
entrance to
sign up for the maze.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.239
Alright then. Let's stop fucking
around here and do this thing.

18:08.371 --> 18:09.273
I'll text the boys.

18:09.406 --> 18:11.541
Ok.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.913
That looks
almost too good to be here.

18:16.047 --> 18:16.914
What?

18:17.048 --> 18:18.015
That scarecrow.

18:18.816 --> 18:20.284
Dude, there's nothing there.

18:23.187 --> 18:26.456
I swear there was a
creepy ass scarecrow there.

18:26.590 --> 18:27.959
Isn't that kinda
the point of this place?

18:28.092 --> 18:29.060
Yeah.

18:30.527 --> 18:35.333
I've got spirit, yes I do!
I've got spirit, how about you?

18:35.465 --> 18:38.236
You
look like a shitty porn star!

18:39.270 --> 18:42.840
I'm gonna fucking kill
Rustin for spreading that rumor.

18:42.974 --> 18:44.342
Fucking-

18:44.474 --> 18:45.776
I think you look hot.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.186
Oh Jesus! Fuck!

18:57.054 --> 18:58.155
Jesus.

18:59.257 --> 19:02.093
Occupied means occupied!
Dickfer!

19:04.161 --> 19:05.395
That was awesome.

19:05.528 --> 19:07.430
Dude I got piss on me.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.799
Yeah I know it was a good prank.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.667
Did you hear
he called you Dickfer?

19:10.801 --> 19:12.469
What's a Dickfer?

19:12.602 --> 19:13.971
From what I hear,

19:14.105 --> 19:16.573
yours is for well
lubricated masturbation.

19:17.241 --> 19:20.477
Girls are at the south gate.

19:33.057 --> 19:35.793
Welcome to Fear Pharm.

19:35.927 --> 19:38.628
For your
safety and that of others,

19:38.763 --> 19:42.432
we ask you to abide
by a few simple rules.

19:42.565 --> 19:46.670
First of all please turn in
all of your cell phones before

19:46.804 --> 19:48.272
entering the maze. Don't worry.

19:48.406 --> 19:49.840
You'll get them back.

19:50.440 --> 19:55.413
Also, each guest will be
stamped for your own safety.

19:56.013 --> 19:58.916
Our maze is
over 100 acres long.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.718
You don't
want to get lost in there.

20:08.692 --> 20:11.561
Thank you.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.502
Is everything okay?

20:35.119 --> 20:37.721
Yeah I don't blame you.

20:53.570 --> 20:56.007
What's
going on? Is everything alright?

20:56.140 --> 20:58.342
Is there something
wrong with my stamp?

20:58.476 --> 21:00.878
Everything's fine.

21:01.012 --> 21:02.746
Do you
know what this stamp means?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.249
No. What
does it mean?

21:05.383 --> 21:08.119
It means that
you're the 10,000th visitor to

21:08.252 --> 21:09.253
our maze this season.

21:09.387 --> 21:12.323
Sweet. So then what?

21:12.456 --> 21:16.526
It means that you get to
visit our VIP maze experience.

21:25.469 --> 21:27.004
What do you say Bobby?

21:33.277 --> 21:37.148
So, which one of
you is the lucky winner?

21:37.281 --> 21:39.716
Uh, that's me. I guess.

21:39.850 --> 21:42.420
Well congratulations...

21:42.552 --> 21:43.421
Melanie.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.890
Melanie, Melanie...

21:46.023 --> 21:47.124
Brandon.

21:47.258 --> 21:48.492
Wendy.

21:48.625 --> 21:49.692
Rustin.

21:49.827 --> 21:54.398
Melanie,
Brandon, Wendy, Rustin.

21:54.532 --> 21:55.399
Yeah.

21:55.533 --> 21:56.566
Great name.

21:56.699 --> 21:57.600
Thank you.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.036
Well I'm Herschel,

22:00.271 --> 22:02.073
Herschel Walker, and I just
so happen to own this place.

22:02.206 --> 22:03.107
Very cool.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.910
Thank you,
and Melanie here just

22:06.043 --> 22:09.413
so happens to be our
10,000th customer this season.

22:09.547 --> 22:11.015
That is what they tell me.

22:11.849 --> 22:13.417
So what does it mean?

22:13.551 --> 22:16.420
Like we get a couple t-shirts,
a free t-shirt or something?

22:16.554 --> 22:18.122
Hey, what's the VIP maze?

22:21.792 --> 22:25.930
Well, looks like
somebody spoiled the surprise.

22:26.063 --> 22:29.934
Sorry. I
just-I get so excited.

22:33.636 --> 22:35.372
I completely understand.

22:37.408 --> 22:38.876
The VIP maze

22:39.009 --> 22:42.679
happens maybe once a year.

22:43.881 --> 22:45.916
You know,
we're a small family business.

22:46.050 --> 22:49.520
So sometimes we don't
even get 10,000 visitors.

22:49.652 --> 22:51.822
Heck sometimes we build the
VIP maze and nobody

22:51.956 --> 22:53.357
is there to experience it.

22:53.491 --> 22:56.160
So the VIP maze is
different than the normal one?

22:56.693 --> 23:00.264
Oh yeah, yes it is.

23:01.532 --> 23:05.402
Melanie, how would
you and your friends like

23:05.536 --> 23:08.205
to experience the VIP maze?

23:08.339 --> 23:10.574
Now I'll tell you what.

23:10.707 --> 23:12.977
You finish
in under two hours,

23:13.743 --> 23:15.980
you'll win $5000.

23:16.113 --> 23:20.985
Fuck me. I mean $5000?

23:21.118 --> 23:21.785
Uh huh.

23:21.919 --> 23:23.821
$5,000 dollars, dollars?

23:23.954 --> 23:25.422
Like not pumpkin
money or something?

23:25.556 --> 23:27.391
Yes sir.

23:27.525 --> 23:29.493
You know what? It's
coming to the end of the season

23:29.627 --> 23:30.594
I'll do you one better.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.297
You finish in under
one hour and I'll double it.

23:34.598 --> 23:37.067
$10,000? Seriously?

23:37.201 --> 23:41.305
Yes. Uh huh.
What do you say Melanie?

23:44.408 --> 23:46.076
Well don't look at me.

23:46.210 --> 23:47.144
You know I'm in.

23:47.278 --> 23:49.180
There's no
doubt about that, no.

23:49.313 --> 23:49.980
I'm in.

23:50.114 --> 23:50.981
Yeah, fuck yeah. I'm in.

23:51.115 --> 23:52.383
I guess we are all in.

23:52.516 --> 23:53.751
Fantastic!

23:53.884 --> 23:55.419
Let's go for a ride!

23:56.554 --> 23:57.988
Come on, strap in.

23:58.122 --> 23:59.722
Safety first, people.

24:17.675 --> 24:20.110
Hang on!

24:22.046 --> 24:24.515
Saving Private Ryan!

24:24.648 --> 24:26.083
I don't
know what's happening!

24:32.289 --> 24:34.091
Alright.

24:34.225 --> 24:37.661
Ok. Are you guys
out of your fucking minds?

24:37.795 --> 24:39.096
We're all gonna die out here.

24:50.608 --> 24:53.043
Hey! It looks like we've
got ourselves a road block.

24:53.177 --> 24:55.212
I'm gonna need
your help on this one.

24:55.346 --> 24:57.548
Man those guns.

25:00.651 --> 25:02.486
Come on guys, nut up!

25:07.858 --> 25:10.027
Hey, hey!
five bucks for every dick shot.

25:10.894 --> 25:14.031
This must be how
Mariah Carey feels every day!

25:20.237 --> 25:21.138
See ya!

25:21.605 --> 25:26.243
Stop with the dick shots!

25:28.112 --> 25:30.281
Oh my God. I
almost feel bad.

25:30.414 --> 25:31.782
I don't.

25:38.489 --> 25:40.858
Fuck yeah, dude!

25:41.825 --> 25:43.827
Fuck you!

25:43.961 --> 25:46.096
Thank you.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.773
So which one of
these is the VIP maze?

25:55.539 --> 25:57.975
Now you don't think I was
gonna make it that easy, do you?

25:58.108 --> 26:00.311
Wait,
there's more than one option?

26:00.444 --> 26:01.679
Actually five.

26:01.812 --> 26:05.049
Now they all go down and
end up at the end of the maze,

26:05.182 --> 26:07.151
just some
take longer than others.

26:07.284 --> 26:09.754
Do some take
longer than 2 hours?

26:09.887 --> 26:12.389
Why
yes Rustin, you are catching on.

26:12.523 --> 26:16.795
Ok so we all
get a path and if we're bad on

26:16.927 --> 26:19.463
the path and it doesn't work
out, we don't get the money.

26:19.596 --> 26:20.799
Right, again.

26:20.931 --> 26:21.899
Ok.

26:22.032 --> 26:23.634
Can we split up?

26:23.768 --> 26:24.835
Wait, what?

26:25.436 --> 26:27.037
Well
there's 5 paths and four of us.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.906
If we split up we have
a way better chance of winning.

26:29.039 --> 26:31.542
Well I just
see the wheels a' turning.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.645
Yes you can split up.

26:34.779 --> 26:36.246
Now, you are not required to.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.716
You can all go on one path, or

26:38.849 --> 26:43.554
you go your separate
ways, increase your chances.

26:44.756 --> 26:47.826
If we all get there in under two
hours do we all get $10,000?

26:47.958 --> 26:49.159
Nice try.

26:49.293 --> 26:50.795
Guys I don't
want to split up.

26:50.928 --> 26:52.229
Well you can go with me, baby.

26:52.363 --> 26:54.131
Yeah we can all go together.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.834
We'll just pick
one path and stick with it.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.234
Come on
guys, are you serious?

26:57.368 --> 26:59.838
Statistically if we split up we

26:59.970 --> 27:01.605
have a way
better chance of winning.

27:02.573 --> 27:04.508
Mel
makes a good point though.

27:05.008 --> 27:07.077
Hey, do
people ever get lost out here?

27:07.611 --> 27:09.313
Lost?

27:09.880 --> 27:12.983
Son
it's a corn maze.

27:13.117 --> 27:17.254
Getting lost
is kinda the point.

27:19.323 --> 27:21.458
And what
about the satanic cult?

27:21.592 --> 27:22.794
Oh Jesus.

27:22.926 --> 27:23.927
The what?

27:24.061 --> 27:25.896
10 years ago a virgin girl was

27:26.029 --> 27:27.664
sacrificed out
here by a satanic cult.

27:27.799 --> 27:28.767
It was on the news.

27:28.899 --> 27:30.200
Virgin sacrifice.

27:31.201 --> 27:33.437
Son, the average
age of the corn maze is 10.

27:33.570 --> 27:37.674
Heck, a 12 year old
girl won the $5000 in the VIP

27:37.809 --> 27:38.942
maze just last season.

27:39.076 --> 27:41.145
Now as much as I love the mystic

27:41.278 --> 27:43.614
and the urban legends
that help keep my doors open,

27:45.215 --> 27:48.652
in all honesty we're
just a fun, family corn maze.

27:48.787 --> 27:50.421
So what do you guys want to do?

27:52.322 --> 27:55.025
You know, we don't
have to do this, guys.

27:55.459 --> 27:57.796
No, we'll just
hop back in the truck, go

27:57.928 --> 27:58.897
back to the main gate and you

27:59.864 --> 28:01.398
guys can enjoy
the normal maze if you want.

28:01.532 --> 28:04.168
Come on, seriously
you guys. Have some balls.

28:04.301 --> 28:05.702
Yeah no, Mel's right.

28:05.837 --> 28:08.238
We're just freaking
ourselves out for no reason.

28:08.372 --> 28:11.041
I mean it's a child's
corn maze, what could happen?

28:11.175 --> 28:13.143
Yeah, little kids do this shit.

28:13.277 --> 28:14.813
Yeah, we'll
each pick a different path

28:14.945 --> 28:17.247
and we'll just run for the
money. Make a quick cash grab.

28:17.916 --> 28:20.984
Ok, ok, but I want
you to enjoy the experience.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.788
Now I pay a lot of people to
dress up to scare you guys.

28:23.922 --> 28:27.624
It'd be kind of a waste just
to run through the corn maze.

28:27.759 --> 28:29.928
Ah Herschel, you're a beautiful

28:30.060 --> 28:31.728
man but a stupid child.

28:31.863 --> 28:35.065
I love you, but we come
from very Republican parents.

28:35.199 --> 28:37.334
We're all about the Benjamin's.

28:37.468 --> 28:38.535
Ah, I see.

28:38.669 --> 28:41.338
Ok well, I want you
guys to have a good time

28:41.472 --> 28:45.008
alright, not focus on
these Benjamin's, alright.

28:45.142 --> 28:47.211
I'm gonna do you a favor.

28:49.881 --> 28:51.916
Don't take the middle path.

28:52.049 --> 28:53.617
Why would that be, Herschel.

28:53.751 --> 28:56.687
Has it got a little trick
or a rig in there or what?

28:56.821 --> 28:58.088
It's not a trick.

28:58.222 --> 28:59.723
People on average
take the middle path.

28:59.858 --> 29:01.458
That's why I made it the
longest for that very reason.

29:01.592 --> 29:05.562
Look. Four
people, four paths.

29:05.696 --> 29:07.097
Problem solved.

29:07.866 --> 29:11.001
Fuck it, let's do it!

29:11.535 --> 29:12.536
Fuck yeah, dude!

29:13.570 --> 29:16.340
You guys are sure.
This is what we want to do?

29:16.473 --> 29:17.441
Yeah.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.544
Rustin, didn't I just tell
you about the 12 year old girl?

29:20.677 --> 29:21.880
Yeah.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.082
Yeah Mr. "I watched Nightmare
on Elm Street before you."

29:25.215 --> 29:26.583
Stop being such a pussy.

29:26.717 --> 29:29.019
Fuck you, Melanie! I'm
just asking him some questions.

29:29.152 --> 29:30.554
God, you always do this!

29:30.687 --> 29:32.122
This is why mom and
dad don't love you as much.

29:32.256 --> 29:33.190
Oh, that's funny?

29:33.323 --> 29:34.391
Well you know what?

29:34.525 --> 29:35.459
I'm gonna get there first

29:35.592 --> 29:36.995
and when I win the $10,000,

29:37.461 --> 29:39.429
we'll see who's laughing when me
and Herschel are fucking models

29:39.563 --> 29:40.664
in my G7.

29:40.798 --> 29:42.232
Stay gold, Pony Boy.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.903
You wouldn't be able
to afford that with $10,000.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.538
Alright, I guess this is it.

29:47.671 --> 29:49.007
Have fun.

29:49.139 --> 29:50.107
You too, babe.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.108
See you in a couple hours, ok?

29:51.241 --> 29:52.442
Alright.
Ok.

29:53.978 --> 29:55.712
Hey thank you, alright?

29:56.647 --> 29:58.783
I'm taking
the path on the right!

30:35.319 --> 30:37.154
Alright
boys and girls.

30:37.287 --> 30:38.589
Let's be safe out there.

30:39.356 --> 30:43.795
And remember,
preservation is key.

31:55.967 --> 31:59.569
I did not crush that
audition this morning.

32:44.347 --> 32:47.217
I'm from Ohio.

32:48.086 --> 32:49.921
Cool.

32:54.826 --> 32:56.994
Brandon
takes possession of the ball.

32:57.128 --> 33:00.898
Nobody can stop him and it's
a goal and the crowd goes wild.

33:01.032 --> 33:02.967
Wild. Wild. He wins.

33:43.775 --> 33:44.976
Give me an "L"!

33:45.109 --> 33:46.443
Give me an "O"!

33:46.576 --> 33:47.544
Give me an "S"!

33:47.677 --> 33:48.645
Give me an "E"!

33:48.780 --> 33:49.679
Give me an "R"!

33:51.581 --> 33:51.883
Loser.

33:53.117 --> 33:54.819
Loser.

33:54.952 --> 33:56.988
Loser.

33:57.121 --> 33:58.956
Wow. Hilarious.

33:59.523 --> 34:01.558
Loser.

34:40.429 --> 34:44.333
Ok...

34:47.469 --> 34:49.639
Fuck me!

34:51.141 --> 34:55.179
You got me, man. I don't scare
easy and you fucking got me.

34:55.847 --> 34:58.682
You are
a big motherfucker.

34:58.816 --> 35:00.117
Dude, what
are you doing out here?

35:00.251 --> 35:01.786
You should be in movies.

35:01.919 --> 35:04.755
Who's your agent, man? Stella?

35:05.256 --> 35:06.891
You with ADA on the east side?

35:08.826 --> 35:11.628
Nothing? You can't
just drop character like that.

35:11.762 --> 35:13.197
You had the
great scare, the great entrance.

35:14.431 --> 35:15.565
You're fucking spooky and
then you're just gonna drop it?

35:16.733 --> 35:19.703
Alright look buddy, let me
uh give you a little advice.

35:19.837 --> 35:24.507
Ok, I've done a little acting
myself and this is basic stuff,

35:24.641 --> 35:26.010
real simple.
It's Meisner, ok?

35:26.143 --> 35:29.746
You gotta
invent the memory, alright?

35:29.881 --> 35:32.549
Now I know in real life you're
probably this average Joe.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.551
You
know you spend a lot of time

35:34.684 --> 35:36.254
fucking
around in a corn maze.

35:36.386 --> 35:37.889
Don't get laid enough.

35:38.022 --> 35:40.390
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever
your life is use that ok?

35:40.523 --> 35:42.193
But when you
put on that mask alright?

35:42.326 --> 35:46.596
You've got to know that
you are a psychotic murderer

35:46.730 --> 35:47.798
capable of anything.

35:47.932 --> 35:49.033
Alright it's um-

35:49.399 --> 35:51.601
There's a quote from
one of my favorite actors right,

35:51.735 --> 35:52.870
Freddie Prinze Jr.

35:53.004 --> 35:54.772
He always
says, acting is living

35:54.906 --> 35:57.574
truthfully under
imaginary circumstances.

35:57.707 --> 35:58.876
I think that's very true.

36:00.011 --> 36:01.444
Dude I'm giving you gold here.

36:01.578 --> 36:02.914
You should be writing this down.

36:04.782 --> 36:06.884
Alright well
good luck man, Jesus.

36:07.018 --> 36:09.320
Fuck you too.
I'm trying to help a guy out.

36:09.452 --> 36:11.521
Fucking asshole.

36:51.329 --> 36:53.798
Ok.

36:58.035 --> 36:59.937
Nice try, dude.

37:19.123 --> 37:21.192
Fuck.

37:25.528 --> 37:28.531
Wendy!

37:32.103 --> 37:34.138
Brandon?

37:37.074 --> 37:39.844
Rustin?

38:31.661 --> 38:33.563
Hey there, big boy.

38:33.696 --> 38:37.935
Well, aren't you handsome?

38:38.601 --> 38:39.970
You too.

38:41.105 --> 38:43.340
Think you could give me
a little pointer on how to get

38:43.474 --> 38:44.475
out of these parts?

38:45.543 --> 38:47.044
Oh, sweetie we're not
allowed to tell you that.

38:47.178 --> 38:49.313
That's right, right,
right. $10,000 I get it.

38:49.447 --> 38:53.317
But, maybe there's something
else I can help you with.

38:54.051 --> 38:56.686
I'm sorry.
I'm not following you.

38:57.388 --> 38:59.123
We're all alone out here.

38:59.890 --> 39:02.126
Maybe, have a little fun.

39:02.259 --> 39:04.694
Our little secret.

39:05.728 --> 39:08.999
Ah, um yeah it's just,

39:09.133 --> 39:12.669
I'm with someone. You know?

39:12.803 --> 39:15.439
Oh, that's too bad.

39:16.173 --> 39:20.277
What
if I let you tie me up and do

39:20.411 --> 39:23.147
whatever you want to me.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.649
Oh, wow.

39:26.784 --> 39:29.086
It's-that sounds like a friggin'

39:29.220 --> 39:32.189
awesome idea 'cause
you are like fire you know?

39:32.323 --> 39:33.991
Now I'm gonna kill
myself for saying this.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.593
I just-I
got to pass you know?

39:35.725 --> 39:38.295
I got to be loyal.
Just damn, you know?

39:39.029 --> 39:43.234
Well I don't know could you
at least run or something then?

39:43.901 --> 39:46.103
I really need the exercise.

39:46.237 --> 39:47.171
What?

39:48.005 --> 39:48.939
And I really
like it when they run.

39:49.073 --> 39:50.107
What?

39:51.442 --> 39:53.944
Fuck! Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah!

39:54.078 --> 39:55.946
You just fucking cut me.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.182
Are you out of
your fucking mind? Fuck!

39:59.984 --> 40:01.952
You know what?

40:02.786 --> 40:04.989
I like you.

40:05.556 --> 40:07.424
I'm gonna give you a head start.

40:08.292 --> 40:10.727
Ready? Ok.

40:10.861 --> 40:13.430
1 one thousand.

40:13.564 --> 40:14.731
2 one thousand.

40:14.865 --> 40:16.267
3 one thousand.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.401
4 one thousand.

40:17.535 --> 40:19.003
Fuck this, man. Fuck.

40:19.403 --> 40:20.471
6 one thousand.

40:20.604 --> 40:22.072
7 one thousand.

40:22.206 --> 40:23.073
8 one thousand.

40:23.207 --> 40:24.707
9 one thousand.

40:35.586 --> 40:38.289
Ready or not, here I come!

40:47.898 --> 40:52.136
Whoa. They
really stepped their game up.

40:56.106 --> 40:58.342
It's ok, they're
just trying to scare you.

40:59.843 --> 41:02.046
You got this.

41:04.148 --> 41:08.752
Dude,
your outfit is creepy as shit.

41:14.692 --> 41:17.461
What is up with this mask?

43:19.383 --> 43:24.288
Come
out, come out, wherever you are!

43:30.627 --> 43:33.430
There you are. Gosh.

43:38.268 --> 43:39.436
Oh no, no, no, no!

43:39.570 --> 43:41.238
Ah ya!

43:41.372 --> 43:43.173
You lose.

43:53.417 --> 43:55.152
What the fuck
are you doing?

43:55.285 --> 43:56.920
You're supposed to be in path 4!

43:57.054 --> 43:59.189
I'm sorry. I lost her.

43:59.323 --> 44:01.860
What the fuck
do you mean you lost her?

44:01.992 --> 44:03.560
It means she's a fucking ninja.

44:03.694 --> 44:05.462
Are you fucking kidding me?

44:05.596 --> 44:07.531
God Damnit! Fuck.

44:17.074 --> 44:20.812
Look, hey, hey, hey, hey.

44:20.944 --> 44:23.815
I am sorry for yelling, okay.

44:23.947 --> 44:25.549
She's really fast.

44:25.682 --> 44:28.318
Yeah, I am sure she was.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.222
Here, why don't you take pretty

44:32.356 --> 44:35.025
boy here back to the lab
and I'll try and find her, ok?

44:35.159 --> 44:36.861
Oh my God he's so little.

44:39.463 --> 44:41.498
I know but I'm still not
strong enough to carry him back.

44:41.632 --> 44:42.566
I am.

44:42.699 --> 44:44.201
Yes you are!

44:45.469 --> 44:46.871
Just take him back to the lab
and I'll go try and find her.

44:47.004 --> 44:48.205
Ok.
Ok?

44:50.340 --> 44:51.141
Oh.

44:51.275 --> 44:53.076
Hey! By the way those peanut

44:53.210 --> 44:55.078
butter delights
you made were amazing!

44:55.847 --> 44:56.980
Really?

44:57.114 --> 44:58.649
Just as good
as Mom used to make.

45:35.285 --> 45:39.958
Hey dude, you uh...
Can I run something by you?

45:40.090 --> 45:41.525
I just, I
came up with this thing

45:41.692 --> 45:43.494
but I don't have anybody
to show it to, and it's like...

45:43.660 --> 45:44.762
Ready?

45:46.898 --> 45:48.432
It's corn on the cock.

45:49.066 --> 45:51.502
Yeah it's not my best, but it's-
There's something there, right?

45:51.635 --> 45:53.470
It's funny. It's just I don't
know where to go with it.

45:53.604 --> 45:54.605
Ya know?

45:55.706 --> 45:57.241
Alright you're not a prop
comedy guy, that's fine.

45:57.374 --> 45:58.442
It's whatever.
It's not for everyone.

46:05.349 --> 46:06.583
Do you
know what time it is?

46:06.717 --> 46:08.418
I just, I've
been walking around

46:08.552 --> 46:10.254
this fucking
place, it feels like hours.

46:10.387 --> 46:12.489
I only got 2 hours
to finish this thing and I don't

46:12.623 --> 46:14.658
know if my friends are out yet
or if- so could you just like-

46:14.792 --> 46:18.595
I'm just so bad at
reading stars, you know?

46:18.729 --> 46:20.297
Alright, come
on man. Just help me out.

46:21.398 --> 46:22.767
Ok, you don't know my sister,
she's gonna be such

46:22.901 --> 46:24.635
a fucking cunt if
she beats me in this thing.

46:25.269 --> 46:27.772
Nothing. Alright.
Hard sell, that's cool.

46:27.906 --> 46:29.273
I get it. I get it. I get it.

46:29.406 --> 46:32.911
Um, well I
didn't want to have to

46:33.043 --> 46:37.514
pull rank on you but uh...

46:37.648 --> 46:38.615
I know Herschel.

46:39.716 --> 46:42.586
So maybe you just
got a little radio or something

46:42.719 --> 46:44.822
you could, ya know, just like
kind of walkie talkie to him,

46:44.956 --> 46:46.123
let him know his buddy Rustin is

46:46.256 --> 46:48.125
ready to get the
fuck out of this maze.

46:48.258 --> 46:49.126
That would-

46:49.259 --> 46:50.995
Where are ya going?

46:51.128 --> 46:52.262
I can see you.

46:53.263 --> 46:54.531
You're just gonna walk?
You're just gonna back-

46:54.665 --> 46:55.867
You're not even
gonna walk forward into it?

46:56.466 --> 46:58.435
Really fucking cool,
man. You know what?

46:58.569 --> 47:00.404
Have fun stopping
cousins from hand jobbing all

47:00.537 --> 47:02.372
over each other out
here you fucking douche bag.

47:02.506 --> 47:04.541
Damn I hate this fucking maze.

47:31.134 --> 47:35.405
And I will strike thee down with
great vengeance and furious-

47:36.774 --> 47:38.141
Fuck.

47:40.778 --> 47:43.447
You talking to me?

47:43.580 --> 47:47.484
I don't see anyone else here
so you must be talking to me.

47:47.618 --> 47:49.787
Huh?

47:49.921 --> 47:51.022
Fucker.

47:52.522 --> 47:53.490
Damn it.

47:53.624 --> 47:56.426
Ok. You wanna play games?

47:57.127 --> 47:58.362
Let's play games.

47:58.495 --> 48:00.297
Say hello to
my little friend.

48:02.399 --> 48:04.601
Fuck you!

48:18.016 --> 48:20.283
Oh that's it.

48:20.617 --> 48:24.022
Now I have had it with
this motherfucking scare-

49:06.931 --> 49:08.265
Holy shit.

49:09.167 --> 49:12.804
Shit. Hey, buddy. Hey, come on.

49:12.937 --> 49:15.006
We've got to
get you out of here.

49:15.139 --> 49:17.674
Mel?

49:18.976 --> 49:20.111
He killed me, man.

49:20.644 --> 49:23.848
No. He didn't, wait.

49:23.981 --> 49:26.751
No listen.
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

49:27.885 --> 49:30.788
You ever seen
an arm fall off before?

49:30.922 --> 49:32.522
No, I haven't.

49:32.656 --> 49:34.224
About as bad as you'd expect.

49:36.094 --> 49:38.896
I need you to listen.

49:39.030 --> 49:40.430
What?

49:40.564 --> 49:44.001
I just want you to know that I'm

49:44.135 --> 49:46.771
your brother and I would never

49:46.904 --> 49:51.308
forgive myself
if I didn't tell you.

49:53.543 --> 49:56.680
I thought you
looked so fat today.

49:57.915 --> 50:01.384
Just saying it's okay
to say the truth sometimes.

50:01.518 --> 50:04.287
Are you serious? Come on.

50:04.421 --> 50:07.091
You know, carbs
aren't always your friends.

50:07.225 --> 50:09.292
I need you to help me.

50:09.426 --> 50:13.030
No, listen! I need
you to go into my room.

50:13.563 --> 50:15.432
Under my bed

50:15.565 --> 50:18.535
there's
some really dark porn stuff.

50:19.036 --> 50:21.538
I don't
want mom and dad to see that.

50:22.572 --> 50:26.144
Just been getting into
some really deep fetish shit.

50:26.676 --> 50:28.846
Some of it feels kind of
illegal.

50:30.413 --> 50:33.785
Mel, I hate you.

50:38.222 --> 50:41.458
Fuck.

50:41.959 --> 50:43.961
Did it look real?

50:44.095 --> 50:45.362
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:45.595 --> 50:46.964
I think that's the
best acting I've ever done.

50:47.265 --> 50:47.765
You see this snot?

50:48.331 --> 50:49.666
No, I got a real tear.

50:49.801 --> 50:51.202
We should get the
fuck out of here, though.

50:51.334 --> 50:52.236
These guys suck, dude.

50:54.172 --> 50:56.473
Mel.

50:57.541 --> 50:59.743
You seem busy.

51:07.384 --> 51:08.718
I'm just gonna get the car.

51:33.845 --> 51:35.579
Rustin!

51:35.712 --> 51:37.915
I got him!

52:11.315 --> 52:14.118
Oh good, you're awake.

52:19.389 --> 52:21.025
What the fuck is going on?

52:21.658 --> 52:24.362
I'm sorry we
don't have time for that.

52:24.494 --> 52:27.298
The process takes forever and if
I told everyone what was going

52:27.430 --> 52:28.698
on I would
never get any work done.

52:28.833 --> 52:30.301
Let me go
you fucking crazy bitch!

52:30.433 --> 52:32.803
No!
Fuck no, no, no, no.

52:32.937 --> 52:34.404
You kiss your
mother with that mouth?

52:34.805 --> 52:36.774
Look I'm gonna need
you to stop struggling

52:36.908 --> 52:38.342
or this
is going to really hurt.

52:38.475 --> 52:39.409
What the
fuck is going to hurt?

52:39.542 --> 52:40.710
What the fuck is that?

52:42.712 --> 52:44.248
This is a Dermatome.

52:44.382 --> 52:45.715
Do you know what that is?

52:45.850 --> 52:47.218
What the fuck is that?

52:47.351 --> 52:48.718
It's a Dermatome.

52:48.853 --> 52:50.121
I just told you that!

52:50.254 --> 52:51.989
Why don't men ever listen?

52:54.225 --> 52:56.459
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

52:56.593 --> 52:59.397
I'm guessing you
didn't go to medical school,

52:59.529 --> 53:01.866
so I'm going to
dumb this down for you.

53:02.465 --> 53:04.201
This is a

53:04.335 --> 53:07.772
DER-MA-TOME.

53:08.105 --> 53:10.041
It removes
your skin from your body.

53:10.341 --> 53:12.742
No, please, please,
please, no, please.

53:12.877 --> 53:14.678
Here. Let me show you.

53:14.812 --> 53:16.080
No, no, no,
no, hold on. Hold on.

53:29.226 --> 53:31.429
See? That simple.

53:31.862 --> 53:33.397
It gets a lot harder
around your eyes and nose,

53:33.530 --> 53:36.434
but luckily you'll either be
passed out or dead by then.

53:36.767 --> 53:39.703
Please,
please, please just let me go.

53:39.837 --> 53:41.038
I want to go home, please.

53:41.172 --> 53:44.008
Where's Wendy?
Please, please, please.

53:44.141 --> 53:45.109
You talk too much.

53:45.242 --> 53:47.011
You're taking
all the fun out of this.

53:49.447 --> 53:50.414
I want to go home.

54:08.065 --> 54:12.903
Wow, some men
really are faster than others.

54:13.536 --> 54:15.538
Glad I didn't
let you tie me up,

54:15.672 --> 54:17.208
that would have
been a disappointment.

54:19.642 --> 54:21.779
Gemma! Henry is hurt!

54:22.380 --> 54:24.681
What the fuck happened?

54:25.182 --> 54:27.952
That lesbian
bitch stabbed him!

54:30.488 --> 54:32.522
But he's dead?

54:32.655 --> 54:34.458
Do something.

54:34.591 --> 54:35.926
What do you want me to do?

54:36.060 --> 54:37.928
He
has a knife in his fucking head.

54:38.062 --> 54:40.231
I don't
know. I'm not a doctor!

54:40.364 --> 54:41.766
He's dead!

54:43.000 --> 54:45.202
He's not breathing and he
has a knife in his fucking head!

54:45.336 --> 54:47.737
Why
do men make me repeat myself?

54:50.808 --> 54:52.176
Who's still out there?

54:52.309 --> 54:54.611
Deakin and Andy.

54:54.744 --> 54:56.881
Where's Andy?

54:57.014 --> 54:58.416
Path 2.

54:58.548 --> 54:59.417
And Deakin?

55:00.284 --> 55:01.584
I think he's
looking for the lesbian.

55:02.319 --> 55:05.456
Bernard, did
she tell you she was a lesbian?

55:05.588 --> 55:06.490
No.

55:07.291 --> 55:08.859
Did you see
her kissing a girl?

55:08.993 --> 55:09.960
No.

55:10.094 --> 55:12.396
Then why do you
think she's a lesbian?

55:12.530 --> 55:14.932
She was tough and strong.

55:15.066 --> 55:18.436
Just because a
woman is tough and strong

55:18.568 --> 55:20.737
doesn't make her a lesbian.

55:21.439 --> 55:24.008
It doesn't matter.

55:25.810 --> 55:27.878
Which one of
them was on path 2?

55:28.412 --> 55:30.713
The Cheerleader I think.

55:43.494 --> 55:46.663
Well hello there.

55:46.797 --> 55:48.766
I'm Frosty The Clown

55:48.899 --> 55:52.103
here for all of
your frosty treat needs.

55:53.437 --> 55:57.308
How has the maze been going?

55:58.242 --> 56:00.010
Good, I think.

56:00.144 --> 56:02.179
Hey can you tell me
how long I've been out here?

56:02.313 --> 56:03.247
Uhnt uh.

56:22.833 --> 56:25.202
An hour and 20 minutes.

56:25.336 --> 56:26.203
Fuck.

56:26.337 --> 56:27.771
There goes the 10 grand.

56:27.905 --> 56:29.607
I'm sorry.

56:29.739 --> 56:33.244
You'll have to
hurry to win any money.

56:33.377 --> 56:35.246
So none of my
friends have made it out yet?

56:35.379 --> 56:36.280
I don't think so.

56:37.281 --> 56:38.616
You see they
ring the bell every time someone

56:38.748 --> 56:40.683
wins the VIP maze,

56:42.186 --> 56:44.221
and I haven't heard anything.

56:44.355 --> 56:45.523
Have you?

56:45.655 --> 56:47.291
No.

56:47.791 --> 56:51.128
What's your
name little girl?

56:52.296 --> 56:53.164
Wendy.

56:53.297 --> 56:54.064
Wendy.

56:54.198 --> 56:56.400
Would like a treat, Wendy?

56:56.534 --> 56:57.935
They're free of charge.

56:58.068 --> 56:59.370
What'll it be, Kevin?

56:59.503 --> 57:02.106
Well, Frosty,
we've got some Push Pops,

57:02.239 --> 57:06.377
some Drumsticks, and Twincycles
that are blood orange.

57:11.348 --> 57:15.286
So what will it be?

57:15.819 --> 57:18.289
No thanks. I'm trying to win.

57:22.725 --> 57:26.230
Hey, these sound delicious

57:26.363 --> 57:28.265
but between you and me,

57:28.399 --> 57:30.401
I've gained
5 pounds this week.

57:30.534 --> 57:34.004
Are you sure? They're free.

57:34.138 --> 57:36.840
Free. Free, free, free, free.

57:36.974 --> 57:38.242
Free as can be.

57:38.375 --> 57:41.111
Yeah. I should
go if I'm gonna win.

57:46.083 --> 57:51.288
Good luck!

57:55.092 --> 57:57.294
Yeah, maybe
I'll catch you at the end.

57:58.929 --> 58:00.798
Not if I catch you first.

59:56.613 --> 59:57.548
Wendy!

59:57.981 --> 01:00:00.284
Wendy!

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.425
Let's go!

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.018
Found you.

01:03:47.344 --> 01:03:50.180
Melanie...

01:03:50.314 --> 01:03:53.283
Hey Mel. Mel.

01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:57.688
Hey, Mel.

01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:02.659
Mel, hey.

01:04:05.228 --> 01:04:08.933
Hey, you're still here.

01:04:09.067 --> 01:04:10.567
Hey.

01:04:10.701 --> 01:04:12.369
Are you ok?

01:04:12.502 --> 01:04:14.271
I'm ok.

01:04:16.808 --> 01:04:19.343
How are you?

01:04:21.678 --> 01:04:26.350
Ok, fuck.

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:31.722
It's bad.

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:37.028
They gave me something.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.662
I can't feel it.

01:04:41.498 --> 01:04:43.901
I looked down once.

01:04:44.035 --> 01:04:46.004
That was enough.

01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:47.905
Fuck.

01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:52.576
Melanie I am so sorry
I brought you guys here.

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:54.078
I'm so sorry.

01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:56.114
No, it's not your fault.

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:57.314
It's not your fault.

01:04:57.447 --> 01:05:00.584
I am so sorry. I'm scared.

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:04.287
I'm not ready to die.

01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:06.356
I'm not ready to die.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:08.692
I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:05:11.528 --> 01:05:12.897
You're not gonna die.

01:05:13.363 --> 01:05:15.666
I'm
gonna get us out of here, ok?

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:20.303
I promise. You trust me, right?

01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:23.841
Ok.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.379
There she is,

01:05:29.513 --> 01:05:32.549
the answer to all our prayers.

01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:35.153
She's the one.

01:05:35.285 --> 01:05:37.521
After all these years.

01:05:38.488 --> 01:05:41.159
I was beginning to
think that you were a myth.

01:05:41.725 --> 01:05:43.961
I told you we'd find one.

01:05:44.095 --> 01:05:45.797
15 years!

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:47.832
I can't believe it.

01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:56.506
Your Mother would be so proud.

01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:02.479
Your mother would
be proud of all of you.

01:06:06.616 --> 01:06:08.719
And you.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.259
You took my boy away.

01:06:18.528 --> 01:06:19.730
And if I
didn't need you alive

01:06:19.864 --> 01:06:22.332
I would
really enjoy gutting you.

01:06:25.535 --> 01:06:28.172
You're
sure we need her alive?

01:06:28.672 --> 01:06:32.944
It's not an exact
science, but I wouldn't risk it.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.215
How about that one?

01:06:37.347 --> 01:06:38.615
No.

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:40.484
Oh.

01:06:40.617 --> 01:06:42.285
Yeah we got
everything we need from her.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:43.386
You can kill her.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.789
No!
Thank you.

01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:46.323
No, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:06:46.456 --> 01:06:48.425
No! No! No! No! No! No!

01:07:00.972 --> 01:07:02.974
Oh God!

01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:07.410
I'm gonna
kill you, you son of a bitch!

01:07:07.979 --> 01:07:10.248
I'm gonna
kill every last one of you.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.816
She's feisty!

01:07:11.949 --> 01:07:16.353
Yeah, we
still can't kill her yet.

01:07:16.486 --> 01:07:19.556
Fuck you, you psychotic bitch!

01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:22.093
I'm gonna cunt
punch the shit out of you!

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:23.127
Oh...

01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.427
What do you want from me?

01:07:24.561 --> 01:07:26.596
What the fuck
do you want from me?

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:31.601
You didn't tell her?

01:07:35.907 --> 01:07:39.844
Oh, you have

01:07:40.644 --> 01:07:44.148
no idea how special you are.

01:07:44.581 --> 01:07:46.984
Tell her.

01:07:47.118 --> 01:07:49.220
Ugh, we don't need to tell her.

01:07:49.352 --> 01:07:51.388
Tell her.

01:07:51.989 --> 01:07:54.357
I want her to know.

01:07:55.592 --> 01:07:57.295
I want her to know how she

01:07:57.427 --> 01:08:00.264
helped complete
your Mother's work.

01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:09.106
It has everything to do

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.310
with the hand stamp we gave you
on the way into the park.

01:08:12.475 --> 01:08:14.377
The stamp?

01:08:14.912 --> 01:08:16.948
No one ever
asks about that.

01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:19.582
I mean what is
the point of the stamp?

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:24.020
Truth be
told, it's a litmus test.

01:08:24.154 --> 01:08:27.225
It exposes those
with a particular gene.

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:28.993
It's a
relatively new gene.

01:08:29.126 --> 01:08:31.761
It only happened in the last 30
years or so in human evolution.

01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:35.131
And your friends
skins are filled with it.

01:08:35.665 --> 01:08:39.103
First,
we remove the skin,

01:08:39.237 --> 01:08:43.372
then we grind it down
and make it into a liquid.

01:08:43.808 --> 01:08:47.011
And then we turn
it into a face cream.

01:08:47.144 --> 01:08:48.712
Yeah.

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:53.050
And it stops the aging
process just like that.

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:58.555
Florence's Miracle Face Cream!

01:09:00.624 --> 01:09:02.894
You're crazy.

01:09:04.661 --> 01:09:06.529
You're all fucking crazy!

01:09:06.662 --> 01:09:09.133
Now
your skin on the other hand.

01:09:10.835 --> 01:09:12.970
Your skin has more of this gene

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:15.671
than we have
ever encountered before.

01:09:15.805 --> 01:09:17.540
That's why
we need to keep you alive.

01:09:17.674 --> 01:09:21.478
You see, when your
heart stops beating your skin

01:09:21.611 --> 01:09:24.814
fights to stay
alive through osmosis,

01:09:24.948 --> 01:09:26.515
sucking in everything from the

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:29.719
outside world
tainting all of my research.

01:09:30.388 --> 01:09:35.225
Your skin can stay
alive for weeks after your dead,

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.527
how amazing is that?

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:40.965
Thanks for the science
lesson you crazy bitch!

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:44.734
Hey I'll have
you know I graduated with a PHD

01:09:44.868 --> 01:09:47.437
in Biotechnology from UC Davis.

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:50.506
I have 5 Discovery Patents,

01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:53.475
which is only
two less than my mother's.

01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:58.382
And you little
sweetie, you're going to help me

01:09:58.515 --> 01:09:59.850
isolate what makes your genes

01:09:59.984 --> 01:10:02.954
special so we can
find more people like you.

01:10:04.155 --> 01:10:05.389
God Damnit!

01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:07.524
Whoa ho, I like this one!

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:18.035
Honey, where are you gonna go?

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:20.438
You're surrounded,

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:23.506
and if by some miracle

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.709
you get past us

01:10:25.843 --> 01:10:28.179
you're in a
hundred acre corn maze.

01:10:30.314 --> 01:10:31.849
It's over.

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.224
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10:40.358 --> 01:10:42.093
No! No! No!

01:10:43.526 --> 01:10:45.262
Let's talk about this.

01:10:47.098 --> 01:10:48.165
Fuck you!

01:10:48.299 --> 01:10:49.834
No!

01:11:51.362 --> 01:11:52.496
There you go.

01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:53.531
Thank you.

01:11:54.432 --> 01:11:55.299
Have a nice day.
Thanks, you too.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.772
Excuse me. I am looking to
see if anyone has seen my son.

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:03.808
He went
missing over a month ago.

01:12:04.241 --> 01:12:08.711
Nice looking boy,
but I am sorry I haven't seen him.

01:12:09.146 --> 01:12:11.148
Here, let me ask my father.

01:12:11.614 --> 01:12:13.650
Papa...

01:12:13.784 --> 01:12:15.886
this nice
woman's son is missing,

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.354
do you
recognize him?

01:12:19.557 --> 01:12:23.327
No, I don't. Sorry.

01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:25.595
He looks like a good kid.

01:12:27.798 --> 01:12:31.535
Have you
contacted the police?

01:12:32.136 --> 01:12:35.573
Yes I have, but
he's over 18 and so he's not

01:12:35.705 --> 01:12:39.009
considered a runaway, and
there's no way to prove that he

01:12:39.143 --> 01:12:41.779
didn't just take off
so they've been no help.

01:12:42.847 --> 01:12:45.748
Well that's just awful.

01:12:46.183 --> 01:12:47.650
I'm so sorry.

01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:48.886
Thank you.

01:12:49.019 --> 01:12:50.687
Well I'll keep
my eye out for him.

01:12:50.921 --> 01:12:53.757
If I do see him is
there a way to contact you?

01:12:53.891 --> 01:12:56.494
Yeah, all
my information is on the poster.

01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:58.596
Ok, thank
you. I am so sorry.

01:12:58.728 --> 01:13:00.264
Thank you.

01:13:00.397 --> 01:13:01.365
Alright, thanks.

01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:03.067
Excuse me ma'am?

01:13:04.034 --> 01:13:06.003
I know you're
going through a rough time,

01:13:06.137 --> 01:13:09.373
and from the looks of
it you haven't slept much.

01:13:09.507 --> 01:13:11.008
I haven't.

01:13:12.376 --> 01:13:14.677
I want you to try this.

01:13:14.812 --> 01:13:17.381
On no, I'm
sorry - thank you though.

01:13:17.515 --> 01:13:18.816
It's on the house.

01:13:18.949 --> 01:13:22.887
Trust me, you
deserve a little pampering.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.856
It takes the
days of worrying off the skin.

01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:29.692
Go ahead,
I promise you'll love it.

01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:48.879
The scent
it's really comforting.

01:14:01.691 --> 01:14:03.260
Eucalyptus?

01:14:04.094 --> 01:14:06.696
It
reminds me of my son's room.

01:14:59.783 --> 01:15:01.885
Gemma!

01:15:05.856 --> 01:15:07.825
Gemma!

01:15:13.564 --> 01:15:14.932
Well hey there.

01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:18.135
I thought we had
you in a medically induced coma,

01:15:18.269 --> 01:15:19.937
but it seems the drip ran out.

01:15:20.304 --> 01:15:23.007
I wonder how that happened.

01:15:24.441 --> 01:15:26.477
Oh...

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.380
I'm sorry are you
trying to say something?

01:15:29.513 --> 01:15:31.582
You see,
unfortunately when you sliced

01:15:31.715 --> 01:15:33.484
your throat you did a number on

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:35.853
your vocal chords,
but you missed the arteries.

01:15:36.153 --> 01:15:38.789
Luckily I was able
to stitch you back up,

01:15:38.922 --> 01:15:41.191
and the progress
has been amazing!

01:15:43.394 --> 01:15:44.495
Ooh...

01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:47.398
It looks like your pain meds
are also starting to wear off.

01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:49.600
I am
so sorry about that sweetie.

01:15:49.733 --> 01:15:51.402
I'll be right back.

01:16:07.284 --> 01:16:11.188
I know the human
body is a crazy thing right?

01:16:11.955 --> 01:16:14.391
Did you know
that if taken care of properly,

01:16:14.525 --> 01:16:17.361
it only takes 2 weeks
for human skin to grow back?

01:16:17.728 --> 01:16:19.863
Yeah I know, so great!

01:16:20.264 --> 01:16:22.132
So while
we hunt for other people like

01:16:22.266 --> 01:16:24.234
you we can rest easy knowing

01:16:24.368 --> 01:16:26.970
that every two weeks we can
just come back to you for more.

01:16:27.304 --> 01:16:29.340
Now I am just
going to get this going,

01:16:29.808 --> 01:16:34.378
and in a couple of seconds
you'll be back in that coma,

01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:37.414
and you won't have to worry
about any of this anymore.

01:16:37.748 --> 01:16:39.616
There...

01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:48.992
Nighty night.

01:16:58.202 --> 01:17:00.437
Nighty night.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:11.623
