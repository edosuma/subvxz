18:39.291 --> 18:42.250
Because we're children.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.917
- You know what?

18:42.291 --> 18:43.917
It seems like

18:43.959 --> 18:45.583
you have this under control.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.583
- Yeah...

18:47.625 --> 18:49.583
- Fine.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.792
Do you have brothers?

18:52.834 --> 18:55.000
- Guys, check it out.

18:56.917 --> 18:57.875
- Do we tell her?

18:57.917 --> 18:59.792
- We have to.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.959
- Dawn!

19:01.000 --> 19:01.959
You need to see this.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.959
- Not now!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.125
- No! Now!

19:04.166 --> 19:06.083
- [sighs]

19:04.166 --> 19:06.083
What?

19:07.875 --> 19:09.583
Wait, what's going on?

19:09.625 --> 19:11.417
- They're holding hands.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.417
- Yeah, I can see

19:11.458 --> 19:13.083
what's going on,

19:11.458 --> 19:13.083
but I want to know

19:13.125 --> 19:15.875
what's going on.

19:15.917 --> 19:18.125
- So are we still gonna

19:15.917 --> 19:18.125
hang after the party?

19:18.166 --> 19:19.458
- I don't know if I can.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.750
But...

19:20.792 --> 19:22.417
when I dedicate a song

19:20.792 --> 19:22.417
to a special someone,

19:22.458 --> 19:23.917
you'll know who

19:22.458 --> 19:23.917
I'm talking about.

19:23.959 --> 19:25.250
[both giggle]

19:25.291 --> 19:27.250
- That's what he said to me.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.750
- We're sorry, Dawn.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.000
- We've been total jerks

19:28.792 --> 19:31.000
to you today.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.917
And now you've gotta go through

19:31.041 --> 19:32.917
a horrible heartbreak.

19:32.959 --> 19:35.583
- Yeah! That jerk doesn't

19:32.959 --> 19:35.583
get to ruin your summer.

19:35.625 --> 19:39.000
We're the jerks who get

19:35.625 --> 19:39.000
to ruin your summer.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.083
- Look, I agree

19:39.041 --> 19:40.083
you've been jerks.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.834
Big jerks.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.834
Huge jerks.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.083
But don't worry, jerks,

19:43.125 --> 19:44.333
I'm not heartbroken.

19:44.375 --> 19:45.583
- What?

19:44.375 --> 19:45.583
- You're not?

19:45.625 --> 19:46.709
- Why not?

19:46.750 --> 19:48.041
- Look, I mean,

19:46.750 --> 19:48.041
he's cute and all,

19:48.083 --> 19:49.458
but I just met him today.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.625
And that whole D-D-DJ hand

19:49.500 --> 19:52.625
thing is kinda lame.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.542
- But a mayonnaise hand

19:52.667 --> 19:54.542
is cool, right?

19:54.583 --> 19:57.041
both: No!

19:57.083 --> 19:58.875
- Anyway,

19:57.083 --> 19:58.875
he's not playing me.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.542
He's playing her.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.041
You know what?

20:03.083 --> 20:04.792
Even though Madison's

20:03.083 --> 20:04.792
been nasty to me,

20:04.834 --> 20:07.458
I understand the idea of

20:04.834 --> 20:07.458
wanting the best summer ever.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.041
She shouldn't

20:07.500 --> 20:09.041
have her chance of that

20:09.083 --> 20:11.000
being ruined by a lying jerk.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.542
Look, Madison,

20:15.583 --> 20:17.709
I know I may be

20:15.583 --> 20:17.709
risking my job here...

20:17.750 --> 20:19.375
b-u-u-u-u-u-t...

20:19.417 --> 20:21.083
I need to tell you something.

20:21.125 --> 20:27.333
- Okay, buts are my thing.

20:21.125 --> 20:27.333
[clears throat]

20:21.125 --> 20:27.333
B-u-u-u-u-u-t... go on.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.667
- Okay.

20:29.709 --> 20:32.125
- Hey, Dawn,

20:29.709 --> 20:32.125
I got your text.

20:32.166 --> 20:36.000
What'd you wanna

20:32.166 --> 20:36.000
talk to me about?

20:32.166 --> 20:36.000
- Oh, I just wanted to make sure

20:32.166 --> 20:36.000
we're still hanging out later.

20:36.041 --> 20:37.333
- You know it.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.375
- So is that why you can't

20:37.375 --> 20:38.375
hang out with me later?

20:38.417 --> 20:39.834
- Madison?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.250
- You've been playing me.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.792
- No, I haven't, I--

20:42.834 --> 20:46.792
- Oh, yes, you have, and the

20:42.834 --> 20:46.792
player's about to get played.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.542
- Not so fast, D-D-DJ!

20:49.583 --> 20:51.208
- Uh, who--

20:49.583 --> 20:51.208
who are you?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.458
- Girlfriend backup.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.458
So back up.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.333
- Girls, girls...

20:55.375 --> 20:58.375
Look, you can't blame me. I'm

20:55.375 --> 20:58.375
just trying to have the best

20:55.375 --> 20:58.375

20:58.417 --> 20:59.875
- Oh!

20:58.417 --> 20:59.875
- Ooh!

20:59.917 --> 21:04.208
Whaaa!

20:59.917 --> 21:04.208
- Didn't expect that!

21:04.250 --> 21:06.792
- Ow! Owww!

21:06.834 --> 21:10.542
My D-D-DJ hand!

21:06.834 --> 21:10.542
[whimpering]

21:10.583 --> 21:12.542
- Check it out, everybody.

21:12.583 --> 21:16.000
The DJ invented a new dance.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.542
- Come on!

21:16.041 --> 21:19.542
Let's have some fun!

21:19.583 --> 21:20.792
- Hey!

21:20.834 --> 21:22.625
Thanks for looking out for me.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.291
Why'd you do that?

21:24.333 --> 21:27.375
- Oh, well, just seemed like

21:24.333 --> 21:27.375
the right thing to do.

21:27.417 --> 21:28.125
- Well, thanks.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.083
But...

21:29.125 --> 21:30.000
this doesn't make us friends.

21:30.041 --> 21:31.125
- Oh, no.

21:30.041 --> 21:31.125
Definitely not.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.250
- Good.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.291
- Good.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.500
Last words are my thing.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.792
- [mockingly] Good.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.792
- Heard that.

21:36.834 --> 21:39.625
- Oh!

21:36.834 --> 21:39.625
- Don't worry,

21:36.834 --> 21:39.625
I won't tell anybody.
