Multiple cities.
That's a big protest.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.799
And probably be a tad bit larger when the
jury comes to a decision tomorrow night.

00:33.801 --> 00:39.038
And while some will be starting fires,
and others safe in front of their tvs,

00:39.040 --> 00:43.108
I'll be right here taking
your calls on the roost.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.244

Do you see yourself?
Look at you!

02:10.364 --> 02:14.466
This is us. These are our brothers.
Our sisters.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.902
And they're killing us.
You're worse than them.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.738
How much are they
paying you, huh?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.275
How much are they fucking paying you
to act like a god damn clown, huh?

02:24.311 --> 02:25.644
Huh?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.346
Your silence, is our violence.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.722
Move back!

02:45.299 --> 02:49.301

03:22.603 --> 03:25.470
Yeah. That's right.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.340
20 reasons.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.443
You've heard them all before.
They're clich駸.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.545
Each and every one of them.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.415
Drawn to the job.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.819
It's what I was born to do,
as long as I can remember.

03:40.821 --> 03:44.489
I look good in a uniform.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.793
Love them donuts.

03:47.795 --> 03:51.396
All that good shit.
There's other shit too.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.533
Shit I wouldn't
announce that I like.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.369
But I love.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.339
Them bonuses.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.577
Surprises.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.418
Advantages.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.656
The coffee.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.426
Fuck! Ah, shit, man!

04:26.400 --> 04:29.368
To contribute to something
much larger than you.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.671
Being part of... A community.

04:32.673 --> 04:38.010
An ability to make even the tiniest
difference in a person's life.

04:38.012 --> 04:43.415
The respect you earn from each
and every life that you touch.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.452
And even if they think
they don't respect you.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.588
They do.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.890
They just don't know it yet.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.395
There are days I feel
like I only get paid

04:56.397 --> 04:58.430
to point out when you're wrong,

04:58.432 --> 05:00.899
and exercise my state
permission to correct you.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.469
Other days I just listen to when you
tell me how the system failed you.

05:04.471 --> 05:09.908
And I promise you; Every
day, every single day,

05:09.910 --> 05:13.679
Someone tells me how to do my job.
Which is fine.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.580
We all have our
ways we see things.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.649
But, I'll tell you...
My red isn't your red.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.619
Your blue isn't my blue.
My white's not your white.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.822
And my black sure as
hell isn't your black.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.324
Who's talking to me?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.659
Hi there.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.362
I just want to say, when the
rate of black on white murders

05:30.364 --> 05:32.397
is nine times as high as
white on black murders...

05:32.399 --> 05:34.466
- Nine?
- Something like that.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.702
Yeah, because that's
a high number.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.604
Well maybe, but still if
the ratio of white murders

05:39.606 --> 05:43.909
is even say, six to one, tell me who the
victim is and who the victim isn't?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.510
You waiting for me to answer?

05:45.512 --> 05:46.878
No. I...

05:46.880 --> 05:48.714
Would you like to answer?

05:48.716 --> 05:51.450
And they hung up.
Surprise surprise.

05:51.452 --> 05:56.521
We're hearing from "you", not because
we want to, but because we like to.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.556
Get at your girl.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.528
ｶ screams gettin' gullied ｶ

06:03.530 --> 06:05.970
ｶ no support from they idols and
they dreams gettin' sullied ｶ

06:05.994 --> 06:07.766
ｶ they wavin' automatic
guns at anyone ｶ

06:07.768 --> 06:10.535
ｶ it's not just guns, it's
daughters and scared sons... ｶ

06:10.537 --> 06:13.138
okay, so it's a red bike.
It's a vintage red bike.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.541
And, uh, on the handle bars
there are black grips.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.811
It's a vintage red bike.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.146
You going to write this down?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.148
- No, I got it.
- You got it?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.517
- Mm-hm.
- Okay so what happens if you get it mixed?

06:25.519 --> 06:29.554
I got it. Red bike, left bar
tape missing, leather seat.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.556
Road x model d.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.925
No, no, no. There's
no bar tape missing.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.429
On the handle bars
there are black grips.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.634
And you had it here on the step?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.917
Yes. I left it right here. Came
up and they hacked it off.

06:44.919 --> 06:46.399
Took it with the chain
and everything.

06:46.423 --> 06:48.140
Okay, did anyone else see it?

06:48.142 --> 06:50.776
No. No one saw it. Otherwise, you
know, I would have it, right?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.948
Are you sure you just
didn't leave it somewhere?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.584
I mean maybe that's
exactly what happened.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.622
Look, can you... Can you please
just do your job for me?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.793
What does it look
like I'm doing?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.594
Killing kids.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.597
Ah, come again?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.766
Yo, it's-

07:14.768 --> 07:17.128
see, why would someone go ahead
and say some shit like that?

07:17.152 --> 07:18.603
I don't know, okay?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.539
Some... some people are
assholes, I guess.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.141
I guess. And assholes
know everything, right?

07:26.780 --> 07:30.682
Does anybody else want
to talk to me? Hm?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.119
The bike?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.121
The bike.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.159
Here, write it down.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.596
Write it down, in
case my hand slips.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.665
And I make a mistake.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.834
We haven't officially met.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.969
You can call me black cop.
Negro officer.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.904
African American law
enforcement agent.

07:52.906 --> 07:56.074
Minority po-po. Upstanding poc.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.076
That's not how I
left the pencil.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.213
Sellout 5-0. Traitor. House nigger.
Black cop.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.082
I heard it all. I'm
a guy doing a job.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.218
I am not perfect at
it, but I do it well.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.619
Thank you.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.588
I like my job.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.857
You know some people,
they don't like my job.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.859
They don't like me in my job.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.728
"Our people," well, they
don't like me period.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.665
Probably because the last 14
people I put in handcuffs

08:20.667 --> 08:24.236
were black men and women
under the age of 25.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.738
Harsh? Yeah, of course.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.775
But, hey, I didn't get the
nickname boogeyman for being soft.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.678
Stop talking to me.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.182
And it's that reason that
people tell me all the time

08:37.183 --> 08:40.251
that I have lost touch
with my blackness.

08:40.254 --> 08:43.554
On the contrary.
I am very black.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.524
I'm an expert.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.692
But, like I said, my
black isn't your black.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.694
But, you don't
always see my black.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.663
You probably never see it.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.131
But you ain't color
blind, are you?

08:57.137 --> 09:01.072
I never told my father I
was going to be a cop.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.276
He died before I got my badge.

09:04.278 --> 09:07.078
I knew he wouldn't
be happy about it.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.247
He never liked them.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.683
He didn't trust them.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.687
He would say to me,

09:15.689 --> 09:18.723
"you only need to know one
thing about it, boy."

09:18.725 --> 09:23.061
If a cop ever stops you,
for any reason at all,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.564
even if it's for the time...

09:25.566 --> 09:28.733
You freeze, put your
hands in the air,

09:28.735 --> 09:32.604
"and hope to hell you live
to see the next day."

09:32.606 --> 09:34.706
But I was never one to
listen to my father.

09:41.315 --> 09:45.917
Excuse me, sir. Sir,
hold on a minute.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.953
Stop, please.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.589
Stop where you are. Hold it!

09:56.330 --> 09:59.230
Ah. I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.368
I can't hear you. My music's on.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.874
I'm going to remove
my earphones now.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.013
What can I do for you?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.681
You don't need to be talking right
now you need to be listening.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.216
Excuse me, man I just
went to go ge...

10:18.218 --> 10:19.858
I need to ask you a
couple of questions...

10:19.882 --> 10:21.186
For what?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.708
Sir, don't make this
hard for yourself.

10:22.732 --> 10:24.789
What's hard? What are you...?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.858
Just a minute. Can, I help you?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.900
- Hey, let me just tell...
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

10:28.924 --> 10:30.228
No. I just wanted...

10:30.230 --> 10:33.832
Calm down! What do you want?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.700
Nothing.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.803
I mean, I'm not with him
or anything, I just...

10:38.805 --> 10:39.938
Get outta here.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.308
Hold on, are you
fucking kidding me?

10:43.332 --> 10:45.043
Don't worry about him, pal.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.965
What do you mean don't worr...
Don't call me pal.

10:46.989 --> 10:49.948
You, uh, you live around here?

10:49.950 --> 10:54.886
What are you up to tonight?
Wanna tell us your name?

10:54.888 --> 10:57.188
I'm buying water, man.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.691
Do you wanna have a
conversation now?

11:01.395 --> 11:02.827
Sure.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.963
Your name.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.405
I don't have to tell you my name.
And back this guy off me, man.

11:13.407 --> 11:14.406
There's been a disturbance
in the neighborhood.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.274
That's great.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.309
I want to talk to you. I
want to identify you.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.211
- For what?
- I asked you to identify yourself.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.781
I didn't tell you. And now
you're being hostile.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.717
Yo, back you're man off of me.
Yo, step back from me, man.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.252
You might want to
lose the aggression.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.386
There is no aggression here.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.689
Let's try this again.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.224
Yo, back off of me and maybe
we can have a conversation.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.326
You don't tell us how this goes.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.862
With all do respect, that's
what exactly what I'm doing.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.065
Hey. Hey. And why is your
hand on your piece, man?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.866
Okay, sir.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.768
10-78 on a possible 10-17.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.871
You know what? Go. Go
ahead and radio this in.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.273
Embarrass yourself.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.308
I'm not going to ask you again.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.766
Here you want some ID, man? All
right here's my fucking ID.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.868
- Hold it. Don't move!
Put it down!

12:49.870 --> 12:52.270
And when my father
told me that shit,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.339
I was like, damn...

12:54.341 --> 12:57.942
Who wouldn't want that type
of power over someone.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.545
We're going to let
you head home now.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.548
What can I say?
Unfortunate mistake.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.059
I mean, you could have just said right
off the start you were one of us.

13:11.525 --> 13:16.127
You came off pretty
ignorant and aggressive.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.032
All right. Let's get
these cuffs of you.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.531
Out of all those reasons,

16:06.533 --> 16:09.033
I only care about one.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.595
As a number of cities
preparing for the worst

16:11.619 --> 16:13.471
awaiting the grand
jury's verdict

16:13.473 --> 16:16.433
following a shooting of an unarmed black
teen that began with jaywalking...

16:16.457 --> 16:18.343
Looters have already...

16:18.345 --> 16:20.478
After a night of
violent protests

16:20.480 --> 16:22.513
sparked by a police shooting.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.282
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:24.284 --> 16:26.084
- When do we want it?
- Now!

16:37.530 --> 16:41.165
ｶ little one gotta
heed my warning ｶ

16:41.167 --> 16:44.035
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

16:44.037 --> 16:48.172
ｶ he come in early morning ｶ

16:48.174 --> 16:50.541
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

16:50.543 --> 16:54.545
ｶ he go by many names ｶ

16:54.547 --> 16:57.448
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

16:57.450 --> 17:01.386
ｶ we gonna go home
to the flames ｶ

17:01.388 --> 17:04.188
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

17:04.190 --> 17:08.192
ｶ he gon' forgive my sin ｶ

17:08.194 --> 17:10.694
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

17:10.696 --> 17:14.298
ｶ he promise many things ｶ

17:14.300 --> 17:17.468
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

17:17.470 --> 17:21.239
ｶ I can't do him no wrong ｶ

17:21.241 --> 17:24.375
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

17:24.377 --> 17:27.678
ｶ I see him before long ｶ

17:27.680 --> 17:31.082
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

17:31.084 --> 17:34.552
ｶ nobody gonna show
you the way now ｶ

17:34.554 --> 17:37.722
ｶ nobody gonna hold
your hand no ｶ

17:37.724 --> 17:41.225
ｶ nobody gonna show
you the way now ｶ.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.328
My dad used to say that
a change in attitude

17:44.330 --> 17:47.098
is due to blacks being
defensive by nature

17:47.100 --> 17:49.200
which is mistaken as
being aggressive.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.303
See, aggression comes when
you feel disrespected.

17:54.674 --> 17:59.243
Being impolite is sometimes
mistaken for ignorance,

17:59.245 --> 18:01.345
meaning a lack of knowledge.

18:01.347 --> 18:07.552
Impolite defensiveness
versus ignorant aggression.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.588
See, I think, we can
be all those things.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.591
The real challenge, is finding
the right combination.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.033
ｶ little one better
run for your life ｶ

18:16.057 --> 18:18.129
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

18:18.131 --> 18:22.266
ｶ oh, little one where you
going with that knife? ｶ

18:22.268 --> 18:24.702
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

18:24.704 --> 18:28.539
ｶ nobody gonna show

18:28.541 --> 18:31.876
ｶ nobody gonna hold

18:31.878 --> 18:35.313
ｶ nobody gonna lead

18:35.315 --> 18:37.482
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

18:37.484 --> 18:40.618
ｶ nobody gonna let you go no ｶ

18:40.620 --> 18:43.521
ｶ nobody gonna hold

18:43.523 --> 18:47.625
ｶ nobody gonna lead

18:47.627 --> 18:49.460
ｶ the devil is fine ｶ

18:49.462 --> 18:51.295
ｶ the devil is fine ｶ

18:51.297 --> 18:53.297
ｶ the devil is fine ｶ

18:53.299 --> 18:55.600

19:05.311 --> 19:09.714
ｶ little one better

19:09.716 --> 19:12.316
ｶ devil is fine ｶ

19:12.318 --> 19:16.654
ｶ little one where you

19:16.656 --> 19:19.257
ｶ devil is kind ｶ

19:19.259 --> 19:23.327
ｶ little one gotta

19:23.329 --> 19:26.697
ｶ devil is fine ｶ.

19:31.538 --> 19:35.339
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not the point.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.276
And it's pronounced moo-slim.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.877
You know what's
fucked up about that,

19:39.879 --> 19:42.413
now that we're on the subject?

19:44.184 --> 19:47.251
It's like calling a
vegan a beefitarian.

19:47.253 --> 19:48.452
You know why?

19:48.454 --> 19:51.289
Moo. Like the cow.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.791
You can't eat beef. Get me?

19:53.793 --> 19:57.895
A "mooslim" can't eat beef.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.366
That Allah is a practical
joker, isn't he now?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.702
You had kibbi yesterday.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.905
- Yeah, so?
- It's beef.

20:07.907 --> 20:13.377
You had a beef dish from a
"mooslim" food counter.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.446
Right. Well,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.368
I didn't see anyone behind
the counter eating it.

20:17.392 --> 20:19.550
Actually it's pork, I think.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.985
You don't eat pork if you're...

20:20.987 --> 20:23.287
Yes, I do.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.689
I don't know why we're talking
about food in the first place.

20:25.713 --> 20:26.624
What is the point?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.559
The point?

20:28.561 --> 20:31.429
The point is, before you
start questioning my, uh,

20:31.431 --> 20:35.333
what did you call it...
"Bigotry" on religion, okay,

20:35.335 --> 20:37.501
you should know that one
of my friends is a Muslim,

20:37.503 --> 20:40.338
so you can't go around throwing
those cards at me, okay?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.740
It's nothing personal out there.
It's rules.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.376
Don't wear the hijab.
End of story.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.246
Our country's got rules.
You gotta obey them.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.981
People get told
everyday what to wear.

20:49.983 --> 20:52.416
Look at us, we gotta
to wear uniforms.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.658
I walk around here buck naked,
I'm not gonna get service.

20:54.682 --> 20:55.820
That's a rule.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.022
If it's about the head gear...

20:57.046 --> 20:59.023
Just don't do it.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.627
I can't protect you if I don't
know what you look like.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.428
I got to see the whole thing.

21:04.430 --> 21:08.366
Transfer. Second day
off, two months.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.600
I gotta piss.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.016
He's nicer than a
crossing guard,

21:25.018 --> 21:27.585
and completely fucking with you.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.620
Strange way of doing it.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.456
I almost cuffed him
for the hell of it.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.458
Second day, huh?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.528
Yeah, pretty uneventful.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.466
You riding alone too?

21:42.468 --> 21:43.801
Aren't we always?

21:54.781 --> 21:57.348
You okay? You seem...

21:57.350 --> 22:00.651
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
I'm good.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.488
Hope day three is a charm.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.392
Okay. Imagine the lineup.

22:08.394 --> 22:11.028
"Which one of them stole
your purse, ma'am?"

22:11.030 --> 22:12.963
"I think it's the one
with her face covered."

22:12.965 --> 22:15.466
They're all covered.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.369
I mean, you can't go in a
country and be all like

22:18.371 --> 22:21.472
"I can wear want I want,
it's the way we do things."

22:21.474 --> 22:24.375
I go to Libya walk
around naked saying,

22:24.377 --> 22:25.810
"it's my culture,
I'm a nudist...",

22:25.812 --> 22:26.977
my ass is going to jail.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.513
It's a Muslim country.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.082
Pardon me... moo-slim.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.517
You actually believe that shit?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.419
Nope. Not even close.

22:35.421 --> 22:38.456
But, I gotta look at all
sides of the story.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.659
Even the version I don't like.

22:41.661 --> 22:45.596
Look, it's not like I like
playing devil's advocate.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.698
But I gotta do it.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.700
It makes me a better cop.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.970
Sometime you just gotta
wear the other shoe.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.007
You gotta admit though,
that was funny, right?

22:57.009 --> 22:59.610
Cheers.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.549
None of that makes sense.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.819
If you hate something why
do it in the first place?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.456
What's that?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.695
If you claim that you don't
support something...

23:17.697 --> 23:20.564
Challenge it.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.121
What? What you looking at?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.793
Typical. Always profiling.

24:06.612 --> 24:12.516
Martin died, was because
he looked a certain way.

24:12.518 --> 24:17.655
And that way is how
"gangstas" look.

24:17.657 --> 24:21.091
Crushing loss to the bearcats...

24:21.093 --> 24:23.661
Slamming a female student
to the ground...

24:23.663 --> 24:26.543
Fundamentally if you have some
respect for your teachers,

24:26.567 --> 24:27.531
this doesn't happen...

24:27.533 --> 24:29.773
Have here is the
escalation of force...

24:29.797 --> 24:30.935
First the verbalized,

24:30.937 --> 24:32.857
and he failed to comply
with the verbal commands.

24:32.881 --> 24:34.672
I mean, this man...

24:34.674 --> 24:36.574
Don't think police
are your enemies,

24:36.576 --> 24:38.696
don't run at 8:30 in the
morning when you see a cop...

24:38.720 --> 24:40.478
The girl was no Saint either.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.713
He had told her to leave and
she continued to linger...

24:42.715 --> 24:45.049
He made contact, verbalized,
he was polite...

24:45.051 --> 24:47.651
If you obey the police it
doesn't usually happen...

24:47.653 --> 24:49.954
Aside from the fact he was
dressed in that thug wear...

24:49.956 --> 24:52.276
Realize you can't
resist arrest...

24:52.300 --> 24:53.224
comply. Please listen...

24:53.226 --> 24:55.192
thug wear... Comply
and complain later.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.661
To be fair and in defense
of the police...

24:57.663 --> 25:00.197
bad decisions by a cop,
but those decisions

25:00.199 --> 25:04.668
wouldn't have been made if
the perps didn't run away.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.670
We all need to do our part.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.239
If you aren't doing
anything unlawful,

25:08.241 --> 25:10.508
then you shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.510
- And I'm black, okay?
- I knew that.

25:12.534 --> 25:14.214
- Really, how?
- Oh, just a hunch.

25:14.238 --> 25:15.846
You know, that's the problem.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.681
People like you
depend on the divide.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.750
Where would you be without
all this tension?

25:19.752 --> 25:21.685
Paid equally, probably.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.654
You're not funny.
What are you doing?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.222
My part.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.626
33, what do you got?

25:28.628 --> 25:30.194
10-23 on site.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.829
They asked him nicely
to move his truck.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.163
He apparently got out and left.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.165
Can you call for a removal?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.407
- Copy. Will do.
- Thanks. You're a gem.

25:37.431 --> 25:40.399
I know. Echo 97,
good morning to you.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.708
10-8 and a good morning to you.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.011
Copy that. What's your location?

25:47.013 --> 25:49.547
- I'm not reading your GPS.
- Yeah?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.852
Seems like it's a dud.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.921
Guess I'm going to
have to go without it.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.690
As long as you know
where you're going.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.859
Yeah. I do.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.689
Copy 6. Go ahead.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.451
Yeah. I'm on a situation
along bloomdon.

26:33.453 --> 26:34.986
Two black teens causing
a disturbance.

26:34.988 --> 26:36.694
Copy.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.416
Looks like they're
about to do a 10-31.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.897
Which is?

26:39.899 --> 26:41.765
Looks like they're
about to do a deal.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.634
About or doing?

26:43.636 --> 26:45.903
Same thing. If the shoe fits...

26:45.905 --> 26:48.385
Look I'm going to go make sure
that they aren't up to anything.

26:48.409 --> 26:50.374
Do you need a 10-78? Over.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.242
No. Should be fine.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.712
I'm not the one that needs
to be careful. Over.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.380
Copy.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.217
I can't breathe...

28:07.219 --> 28:08.819
I know.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.760
- It's all good, man.
- Is it?

28:16.762 --> 28:19.129
- Yeah.
- Get the fuck outta here.

28:32.044 --> 28:36.080
Hitting them donuts big man.
Giddy up.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.919
Come on.

30:21.320 --> 30:27.825
I was called to the principal's
office just two times in my life.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.595
The first time was for fighting.

30:31.597 --> 30:37.868
Another student was constantly
referring to me as "Dutch fudge,"

30:37.870 --> 30:40.370
like the cookie.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.108
Yeah.

30:47.146 --> 30:50.013
I admit that shit's a bit funny.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.984
No, no. It's okay.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.119
Everyone else thought so too.

31:01.393 --> 31:05.395
And he did this shit
every day for two weeks.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.967
Sat down beside me,

31:09.969 --> 31:13.570
waved the cookie in
the air and ate it.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.106
The last time he did that,

31:16.108 --> 31:18.408
that cookie flew
out of his hand,

31:18.410 --> 31:24.348
when I swung my copy of "math is
fun volume 2" across his face...

31:24.350 --> 31:27.351
A whole lot of times.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.055
Instead of eating that cookie,

31:32.057 --> 31:34.391
he ate some pages of the book.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.230
I was nine years old.

31:40.232 --> 31:44.067
And they brought me into
the office and they say,

31:44.069 --> 31:47.571
"oh there are better ways
to deal with your anger."

31:47.573 --> 31:52.242
I'm like, "well yeah,
I just found one."

31:52.244 --> 31:56.079
You know, that kid just
got off with a warning.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.015
And I got suspended

31:58.017 --> 32:00.684
and told I got
violent tendencies.

32:07.359 --> 32:10.093
The principal,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.663
he's in jail now.

32:12.665 --> 32:16.199
Oh, no, no. I had has
nothing to do with that.

32:16.201 --> 32:19.102
That's his story.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.438
Matter of fact, I wish him well.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.708
But it ain't even about that.

32:24.710 --> 32:29.046
It is about today.
My retirement day.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.614
And it's only right
that I make it

32:30.616 --> 32:33.583
the best day of
policing I can make it.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.119
I mean everything by the book.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.056
All of my
self-righteous bullshit

32:39.058 --> 32:41.425
haa... out the window.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.163
You know, because,
I can go proud

32:46.165 --> 32:48.432
because I know...

32:48.434 --> 32:51.501
There are better ways
to deal with my anger.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.106
So I'm gonna do it.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.976
I don't know about you,
but something tells me

32:58.978 --> 33:02.145
today is a going to
be an amazing day.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.148
Tomorrow? Well, different story.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.184
Something's going to burn.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.152
And it ain't my marshmallows.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.288
I'm in the mood for a song.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.124
Maybe this one will help nudge you
in the right direction today.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.493
Enjoy.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.029
ｶ don't shoot at some cops that
try to act like they own you ｶ

33:19.031 --> 33:21.591
ｶ they confiscate the cameras and
they snatchin' the phones too ｶ

33:21.615 --> 33:24.107
ｶ they grass and tear gas you but
don't get too close to them ｶ

33:24.109 --> 33:25.736
ｶ here to protect and serve ｶ

33:25.738 --> 33:27.771
ｶ yeah, that's not what
these folks doin' ｶ

33:27.773 --> 33:30.307
ｶ cause right now, ain't no
justice for Mike brown ｶ

33:30.309 --> 33:34.578
ｶ white towns, and they just
expect us to pipe down ｶ.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.547
Any units in the area of bilby?

33:37.549 --> 33:39.750
Units in the area of bilby.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.585
We have a report of
a suspicious male.

33:41.587 --> 33:44.187
Grey shirt. Possibly thirties.

33:44.189 --> 33:48.258
On foot. Recent car
breaks in the area. Over.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.710
Is uh... Something wrong?

34:41.713 --> 34:43.346
What are you doing, sir?

34:43.348 --> 34:45.114
- I'm running?
- From?

34:45.117 --> 34:47.284
- Pardon me?
- What are you running from?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.851
I don't understand.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.754
We have reports of
a suspicious man

34:50.755 --> 34:52.636
in a grey top running from
the scene of a crime.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.190
What's that got to do with me?

34:54.193 --> 34:56.092
Well, you're a man in a
grey top running from...

34:56.094 --> 34:57.594
Hey, look, that's crazy.
Anyone can have a grey top.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.229
First of all, don't cut me off.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.164
Second of all,
drop the attitude.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.599
I'm not giving you any attitude.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.501
You have identification?

35:04.503 --> 35:06.503
Look I'm wearing my sweats.
I don't have my wallet.

35:06.527 --> 35:07.471
You can't be serious.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.473
Oh, I'm very serious,

35:09.475 --> 35:12.142
although I generally have an
excellent sense of humor.

35:12.144 --> 35:14.377
Sir, do you really want to
carry on with me right now?

35:14.379 --> 35:16.146
No.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.908
Then I suggest you
cooperate with me, please,

35:17.932 --> 35:19.649
or things won't end
well on your end.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.384
Wait. Am I being
accused of something?

35:21.386 --> 35:22.853
I'm asking the questions here

35:22.855 --> 35:24.821
and you still haven't
answered me.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.290
- What are you asking?
- I've asked you twice already.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.892
I don't remember.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.727
You don't remember where
you're running from?

35:30.729 --> 35:32.762
No. Wait. I don't
remember the question.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.431
I'm out for a run.
People do that.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.266
I know, I deal with
them all the time.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.803
Hey just wait a minute...
I don't need this.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.672
I didn't do anything. You
cannot talk to me like this.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.875
Sir. Calm down and
answer the question.

35:44.877 --> 35:48.578
No.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.814
I don't mean...
What's going on here?

35:50.816 --> 35:52.582
This is not right. Is there a
camera here or something? What...

35:52.584 --> 35:54.317
Sir, just calm down and
answer the question.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.319
Stop this. Stop it.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.188
Are you finished?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.824
What? Am I finished? I
want your badge number.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.926
See I want a lot of things,
but most of the time

36:02.928 --> 36:04.794
I just have to deal
with what I got.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.830
- Look, this is absol...
- Answer the question!

36:06.832 --> 36:08.398
- I don't need this.
- Sir.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.267
What? Do I look like a thug?

36:10.269 --> 36:12.109
Huh? Why don't you go and
try in the north end?

36:12.133 --> 36:14.304
- I'm a doctor.
- A doctor.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.772
That's right.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.341
And doctors do no
illegal activity.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.744
- What the hell!?
- A doctor.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.280
That's right! This...
this is crazy!

36:23.282 --> 36:25.248
Okay, and that's your diagnosis.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.584
You're prescribing
me to the north end?

36:27.586 --> 36:29.553
Look, I didn't
mean it like that.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.488
Well, I don't know
what you mean,

36:31.490 --> 36:33.924
because you have refused to
answer any of my questions.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.592
You're. You're...

36:35.594 --> 36:39.229
I'm a police officer,
you're a doctor.

36:39.231 --> 36:43.833
Well, doc, maybe you
can help me then.

36:43.835 --> 36:50.674
See I got this strange
problem with my elbow.

36:50.676 --> 36:54.511
I just cannot seem to stop...

36:59.251 --> 37:00.850
Swinging my arm...

37:00.852 --> 37:03.386
Please, I didn't do anything.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.855
ｶ don't shoot ｶ

37:05.857 --> 37:07.857
ｶ for those of you who don't
share my world view ｶ

37:07.859 --> 37:10.393
ｶ don't shoot, just turn on
the news if you want proof ｶ

37:10.395 --> 37:13.263
ｶ don't shoot, no limit
to what they won't do ｶ

37:13.265 --> 37:16.233
ｶ swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth ｶ

37:16.235 --> 37:18.668
ｶ don't shoot unless it's
with your mobile devices ｶ

37:18.670 --> 37:21.438
ｶ don't shoot, unless you
witness someone in crisis ｶ

37:21.440 --> 37:24.507
ｶ don't shoot, we got problems
that are bigger than Isis ｶ

37:24.509 --> 37:27.377
ｶ so message to you and
my word of advice is ｶ

37:27.379 --> 37:28.859
- ｶ don't shoot ｶ -

37:28.883 --> 37:30.847
Have fun, doc.

37:30.849 --> 37:34.451
- ｶ don't shoot ｶ -ｶ I'm
beggin' you, don't shoot ｶ

37:34.453 --> 37:36.586
ｶ rip, young boo ｶ

37:36.588 --> 37:38.908
ｶ swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth ｶ

37:38.932 --> 37:41.291
ｶ don't shoot ｶ.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.884
It looks like it another
few days of great weather.

37:54.908 --> 37:56.473
Let's go right to entertainment,

37:56.475 --> 37:58.756
Joyce what is the big news from
last night's urban awards?

37:58.780 --> 38:00.377
Big news is right.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.746
Lots of controversy, and
debate on social media

38:02.748 --> 38:05.649
after rapper Jake mcsweeny actually
apologized to the black nominees

38:05.651 --> 38:07.317
after sweeping the music awards.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.719
Apologized?

38:09.721 --> 38:12.601
That's right. And it was met with
some skepticism and controversy.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.458
Especially when he commented
on recent violence.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.560
I bet.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.642
Yeah. It doesn't stop there.
His producer, dapper Ken

38:19.644 --> 38:21.764
caused even more, if not
worse, controversy by saying,

38:21.788 --> 38:24.467
"you people should get over it
and stop being so hateful."

38:24.469 --> 38:27.437
Uh-oh.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.147
He's since corrected
the term "people"

38:29.159 --> 38:30.879
by insisting he meant
to say "everybody",

38:30.903 --> 38:33.476
but it still raised the
question of getting over what?

38:33.478 --> 38:34.878
And that's what
people want to know.

38:34.902 --> 38:36.546
Yikes.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.581
Always unpredictable
and entertaining

38:38.583 --> 38:41.084
but of course these guys are
no strangers to controversy.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.486
Another head Turner was the
fashion faux pas of...

38:53.365 --> 38:55.665
10-38 in a school zone.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.335
Blue SUV on a joyride.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.472
Use extreme caution.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.669
Do you know why I
stopped you, ma'am?

39:32.671 --> 39:36.039
Hm? Huh?

39:36.041 --> 39:39.709
Do you how fast you were going?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.191
You know this is a
school zone, right?

39:41.215 --> 39:42.746
Well...

39:42.748 --> 39:44.348
The school's been
closed for over a year.

39:44.372 --> 39:46.206
I wasn't talking to you, sir.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.723
License and registration.

39:53.725 --> 39:58.561
Oh. Okay. Um... Okay.
I just.. Um...

39:58.563 --> 40:02.165
"Um. Um um". License and
registration, ma'am.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.327
- Is it in the...
- Can we just...

40:04.351 --> 40:07.937
License... and registration.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.573
Do not let me ask you again.
Let's go.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.409
It's coming. It's coming.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.145
It's in here. Check the
glove compartment.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.236
You know what? Is this
vehicle in your name?

40:19.260 --> 40:20.650
Uh, yeah. Of course it is.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.685
All right. You're going
to stay in the car.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.887
I'm going to call the car in.
Have your documents ready.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.889
Wait where are you going?
What's happening?

40:26.913 --> 40:28.780
Are we being detained?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.840
Sir, what's going on here?
Am I getting a ticket?

40:37.864 --> 40:39.002
Get back in the car, ma'am.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.284
I just need to
know some answers.

40:40.308 --> 40:41.738
Get back in the car.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.740
I deserve to know some answers.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.942
Oh. Get back in the car. And
don't let me ask you again.

40:45.966 --> 40:47.644
I need to know if I'm
getting a ticket.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.612
- Get back in the car.
- I have a right to know what's going on.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.714
I said to get back in the car.
Get back in the car.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.036
I will get back in the car when
you tell me what's going o-

40:54.060 --> 40:55.859
- Okay... Don't
walk away from me.

40:55.861 --> 40:57.541
I told you get back in the car!

40:57.565 --> 40:59.155
Get your hands off me!

40:59.157 --> 41:01.438
We don't want any trouble.
Just don't hurt her.

41:01.462 --> 41:03.460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get back!

41:03.462 --> 41:05.094
Put that away. Put that away!

41:05.096 --> 41:06.996
Back!

41:06.998 --> 41:08.758
You can't do that.
You can't do that!

41:08.782 --> 41:11.000
Stop.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.503
Stop resisting.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.705
Oh, my god.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.708
Give me your hand. Give me...
your hand!

41:18.710 --> 41:21.644
I warned you! I warned you both.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.646
Noooo!

41:23.648 --> 41:25.949
Okay. Give me your arm.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.518
I'm pregnant. Oh my god.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.854
That's fine, ma'am. That's fine.
Stay still.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.856
My god.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.658
Stay still. You'll
be fine, ma'am.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.961
I'm issuing you a ticket.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.064
My god. God.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.665
Quiet.

41:42.667 --> 41:47.670
Shut up!

41:47.672 --> 41:49.506
Shhh.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.174
I'm issuing you a ticket.

42:07.692 --> 42:10.693
All right, here's your ticket.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.695
I'm going to let you go.

42:12.697 --> 42:16.633
And I want you to take care
of it as soon as possible.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.268
All right?

42:29.214 --> 42:31.681
Have a good one.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.689
- Hi, you're on the air.
- Yeah, hello?

42:39.691 --> 42:41.691
Hello. What's your take?

42:41.693 --> 42:43.653
Well, I think, this is
about the other one

42:43.655 --> 42:45.415
that was mentioned earlier
about the woman...

42:45.439 --> 42:47.130
Right.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.197
Yeah. I think the officer was justified
in handling the woman that way.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.867
You do?

42:50.869 --> 42:53.909
Yeah. I think, she was asked twice
to stay back, and she came at him.

42:53.933 --> 42:55.638
She wasn't going to listen.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.401
So the way he took her down, and
threw her, put a knee in her...

42:58.425 --> 43:00.643
Yeah. He's doing his job right.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.405
I wasn't there, but I
think it sounds like...

43:02.429 --> 43:04.347
I think it sounds
worse than it was.

43:04.349 --> 43:07.283
Okay. It was on tape too.

43:07.285 --> 43:09.205
[] It probably looks
worse than it was too.

43:09.229 --> 43:10.753
- He was justified.
- Thank you.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.288
Thanks.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.757
Hey look. I'm just
here on a bench.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.026
I don't understand
what this is about.

43:17.028 --> 43:18.995
I'm waiting for my kids.

43:18.997 --> 43:21.037
I'm just going to get my kids.
And I know my rights.

43:21.061 --> 43:22.765
- You created th...
- And i-

43:22.767 --> 43:24.834
you do not cut me off.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.303
You created the problem, sir.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.939
I created the problem? What are-

43:29.941 --> 43:32.301
That's correct. I asked you to
leave and you're not leaving.

43:32.325 --> 43:34.377
What did I do? I'm
waiting for my kids.

43:34.379 --> 43:37.880
This is where I'm supposed to get them.
Where else am I supposed to go?

43:37.882 --> 43:39.983
You're trespassing because you were asked
to leave and you're not leaving, sir.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.151
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- Yes well, i...

43:42.153 --> 43:43.793
Please don't let me ask
you one more time.

43:43.817 --> 43:45.722
I know that's not how it works.

43:45.724 --> 43:48.091
Now, I don't know what this
is about or who called you.

43:48.093 --> 43:49.993
But I haven't done
anything wrong.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.915
And I'm just going to sit
here and wait for my...

43:51.939 --> 43:54.030
- Sir, get off the bench.
- What?

43:54.032 --> 43:56.099
Sir, get off the bench.

43:56.101 --> 43:59.235
All right.

43:59.237 --> 44:01.104
I'm going to go over here.
And I'm going to...

44:01.106 --> 44:02.946
Are you seeing this? I'm
going to go over here.

44:02.970 --> 44:05.341
Seeing what? Seeing what?

44:05.343 --> 44:08.104
Ow. Help... ohhh... Somebody...
ohh...

44:08.128 --> 44:10.179
Shut the hell up.

44:10.181 --> 44:14.117
Somebody...

44:14.119 --> 44:16.352
You're on the air.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.821
Ladies and gentleman, grab your
cameras and grab your phones

44:18.823 --> 44:21.691
and enjoy the show!

44:23.261 --> 44:25.161
Stop taping me.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.896
What do you expect?

44:26.898 --> 44:29.065
Violent actions receive
violent responses.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.834
It's sick. We always have
to blame the victims.

44:31.836 --> 44:36.172
Yeah. Okay. Deflect
a little more.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.442
Thugs.

44:39.444 --> 44:41.911
You know, in discussing this,

44:41.913 --> 44:44.393
you got to ask the question of
which one had a criminal record.

44:44.417 --> 44:46.688
The only race I believe
in is the human race...

44:46.690 --> 44:48.985
Who whoa. Help. Somebody help!

44:48.987 --> 44:51.707
- We're trying to help...
- It's all race baiting...

44:51.709 --> 44:53.909
police are way less violent
than protesters...

44:53.911 --> 44:57.360
- all lives matter...
- It's flat out injustice...

44:57.362 --> 45:00.229
I'm tired of the
white bashing...

45:00.231 --> 45:02.831
it's difficult to believe that
people are this fucking stupid...

45:02.855 --> 45:05.234
this is nothing but
a smear campaign...

45:05.236 --> 45:07.276
well he must have done
something to provoke it...

45:07.278 --> 45:09.412
who's marching for that
other guy that got shot...

45:09.414 --> 45:11.708
they're criminals...

45:11.710 --> 45:14.210
it's people of color who can't
seem to obey simple orders...

45:14.212 --> 45:16.585
- how innocent is he?
- If you talk

45:16.597 --> 45:18.981
about racism, you're
the racist...

45:18.983 --> 45:20.349
not all cops...

45:20.351 --> 45:22.318
Yah!

45:24.055 --> 45:27.023
Uh-huh. You're on the air.

46:57.982 --> 47:01.417
Man, I don't get why
you're following me.

47:01.419 --> 47:03.119
What's your name?

47:03.121 --> 47:05.054
I don't have to
tell you my name.

47:05.056 --> 47:06.956
Oh. Tell me your name.

47:06.958 --> 47:09.992
Okay, no, I don't think I
have to tell you anything.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.996
- You're trespassing.
- No. This is a school.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.398
Are you in school?

47:15.400 --> 47:17.300
- Yes.
- Right now?

47:17.302 --> 47:19.235
Yeah. I'm currently
a student in...

47:19.237 --> 47:23.072
No, I mean are you "currently"
in class at the moment?

47:23.074 --> 47:25.007
No.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.976
So then you're trespassing.

47:26.978 --> 47:29.058
No. No man, I'm just... I'm
just here to get my bike.

47:29.082 --> 47:30.586
That's all I'm doing.
This is my bike.

47:30.588 --> 47:33.516
Oh, you're bike. That's very
interesting because we got a report

47:33.518 --> 47:37.386
about someone stealing a bike
that looks just like this one.

47:37.388 --> 47:40.189
Well, that's got
nothing to do with me.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.291
I don't know that.

47:42.293 --> 47:45.461
Dude, why are you
doing this to me?

47:45.463 --> 47:47.363
Because.

47:47.365 --> 47:50.032
Matter of fact,
what's in the bag?

47:50.034 --> 47:51.100
Okay that...

47:52.403 --> 47:54.971
- Come on, man.
- Shh. Shh.

47:54.973 --> 47:58.074
- There's nothing in there.
- Well, let's see?

47:58.076 --> 48:01.043
Oh, wow. Look at this.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.579
Whoa. What the fuck? You
can't just do that.

48:03.581 --> 48:05.915
- Shut up.
- That's harassment, man.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.383
Shut up!

48:07.385 --> 48:09.318
That's just my book
what the fuck?

48:09.320 --> 48:12.421
Shut up. What else
we got in here?

48:17.262 --> 48:18.661
You know what, man, fuck you.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.396
- Fuck me?
- This is bullshit.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.065
- Don't touch me!
- Turn around.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.301
- Okay.
- Spread your legs.

48:25.303 --> 48:28.137
Man I didn't fucking do anything.
This is fucked up.

48:28.139 --> 48:31.073
Hey hey! Stop resisting.

48:35.246 --> 48:40.082
Student fuck, man. Why would you that?
What the fuck?

48:43.454 --> 48:46.455
Man. What the fuck, man?
Why would you do that?

48:46.457 --> 48:49.692
- What's wrong... -don't make
another mother-fucking move!

48:54.132 --> 48:57.667
Move again and I will
wet you so fast.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.470
I will end you.

49:08.212 --> 49:12.114
Don't shoot.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.116
Please, don't shoot.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.389
Thanks for being here.

49:20.391 --> 49:22.391
No problem.

49:22.393 --> 49:24.994
Okay. Is this what
you envisioned

49:24.996 --> 49:28.965
when you signed up for the job?

49:28.967 --> 49:31.167
Not exactly, no.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.970
What did you envision it to be?

49:33.972 --> 49:37.540
I just envisioned it to
be a little different.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.575
A little different than
what it currently is.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.611
I can't really put
my finger on it.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.147
Have you ever been accused
of being a bully?

49:45.149 --> 49:47.550
No. I don't think so.

49:47.552 --> 49:50.052
- Huh.
- Huh.

49:50.054 --> 49:52.094
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

49:52.096 --> 49:53.736
And this... this was
supposed to be funny?

49:53.760 --> 49:55.725
No.

49:55.727 --> 49:58.094
Okay, sorry. You said it was
going to be a funny question.

49:58.096 --> 50:01.097
Or the bigotry or the
unfair treatment.

50:01.099 --> 50:04.033
What do you do about it?

50:04.035 --> 50:08.137
I mean, I just...

50:08.139 --> 50:11.674
I cannot control those
other people, man.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.776
I just... I do what I can do.

50:13.778 --> 50:17.346
And I try and be the best
police officer that I can be.

50:17.348 --> 50:22.184
But wouldn't that be protecting
and serving the community?

50:22.186 --> 50:24.453
And I feel I do that.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.895
If you're not doing anything to
see these other things happen?

50:26.919 --> 50:31.093
I mean... isn't that what
the judicial system's for?

50:31.095 --> 50:34.797
Well apparently, that's
not working so well.

50:34.799 --> 50:39.301
Well... then you should be
questioning them not me.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.573
I wouldn't say I'm
part of the problem.

50:44.575 --> 50:48.511
So if you're not... doing
anything about it...

50:48.513 --> 50:52.415
Or if you're not... When you say
there's nothing you can do...

50:52.417 --> 50:56.752
Does that... Where
does that put you?

50:56.754 --> 50:59.288
It puts me where I am right now.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.190
And where's that?

51:01.192 --> 51:04.427
Right here. Just trying
to figure it out.

51:04.429 --> 51:07.663
So at the end of the day,
you look in the mirror.

51:07.665 --> 51:10.833
What do you see?
Do you see a hero?

51:13.738 --> 51:16.839
No.

51:16.841 --> 51:19.675
No.

51:19.677 --> 51:22.578
I see a guy just...

51:22.580 --> 51:26.615
Just trying to do
a job, you know?

51:26.617 --> 51:31.420
Nobody's perfect but, I
do it as good as I can.

51:31.422 --> 51:35.257
I mean, we could always
be better, right?

51:35.259 --> 51:37.726
If you could go back,

51:37.728 --> 51:41.363
would you do this again
if you had the chance to?

51:44.268 --> 51:46.235
I think I would.

51:51.275 --> 51:54.710
I just want to go home.

51:54.712 --> 51:58.380
Just let me go home, please.
I want to go home.

52:02.420 --> 52:05.254
I just want to go home.

52:35.453 --> 52:37.486
Bang.

53:03.714 --> 53:07.616
Is it really always racial? There's
black cops too, isn't there?

53:07.618 --> 53:09.685
I mean, I'm an advocate of
people standing up to...

53:09.687 --> 53:11.647
Right now you're being
a devil's advocate

53:11.671 --> 53:14.356
so, you're not really
advocating for anyone.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.725
Look, I'm saying this:
Things are going to change,

53:16.727 --> 53:18.661
and things are tipping.

53:18.663 --> 53:20.823
And when it does change, shit
is going to go down hard.

53:20.847 --> 53:22.898
I don't want be around
when it happens,

53:22.900 --> 53:25.860
and don't get me wrong I'm going to be
in the stands with popcorn and shit,

53:25.884 --> 53:27.269
watching it all go down,

53:27.271 --> 53:29.191
but someone is going to
come out of the woodwork.

53:29.215 --> 53:31.340
Someone is going to do
some crazy, crazy shit.

53:31.342 --> 53:33.742
And when they do, everyone's
going to be sitting there going,

53:33.766 --> 53:36.612
"what the fuck just happened?".
And we'll be like, "told ya".

53:36.614 --> 53:39.448
10-9, did I hear that right?

54:01.839 --> 54:05.941
I got a couple in the hospital
claiming they were assaulted.

54:05.943 --> 54:09.478
I need someone to look into
possible 10-38 of a white se...

54:21.859 --> 54:24.627
from one of our users on
the Facebook comments,

54:24.629 --> 54:26.996
"whatever happened
to the hands up,"

54:26.998 --> 54:29.031
don't shoot, can't breathe,

54:29.033 --> 54:31.667
"just out to buy
skittles movement?"

54:31.669 --> 54:35.638
It's also important to note that the
user name is spongebill squareshorts

54:35.640 --> 54:38.040
and he "liked" his
own comment...

55:25.589 --> 55:30.492
Black cop. Black cop.

55:30.494 --> 55:33.929
Looking for your people as
you come around the block.

55:35.766 --> 55:37.766
What's up, black cop?

55:43.507 --> 55:46.942
Oh, sorry.

55:46.944 --> 55:50.579
Gotta film just in
case, you know.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.987
Keep doing what you
do, black cop.

56:15.706 --> 56:18.640
You all scream about opinion.

56:18.642 --> 56:20.442
Freedom of speech.

56:22.513 --> 56:25.013
See, but ya'll
motherfuckers can't handle

56:25.015 --> 56:27.750
when that shit hits
you back in the face.

56:27.752 --> 56:31.019
I mean, see, that is the problem
with ya'll motherfuckers.

56:31.021 --> 56:34.556
You think you know everything.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.058
We all do.

56:36.060 --> 56:39.428
See, we know everything we know.

56:39.430 --> 56:41.964
I mean, I hear these young
brothers and they be like,

56:41.966 --> 56:44.566
man, I'm afraid for my life.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.569
I can't walk down the street
without looking over my shoulder

56:47.571 --> 56:53.142
wondering if I'll make it
home from the grocery store.

56:53.144 --> 56:57.646
Well, welcome to my world.

56:57.648 --> 56:59.782
Living in fear is my life.

56:59.784 --> 57:02.184
I mean, I make a traffic stop,

57:02.186 --> 57:05.888
and I have to wonder if last night is
the last time I'm gonna see my sister.

57:08.426 --> 57:11.527
I pull up on a domestic
dispute, and I wonder

57:11.529 --> 57:14.029
if I'm going to get a
shotgun in my face.

57:16.667 --> 57:18.600
I got news for you all, man.

57:18.602 --> 57:21.537
You are not exclusive.

57:21.539 --> 57:24.473
You are not special.

57:24.475 --> 57:26.809
God, man, we all live in fear.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.513
See, but terror.

57:34.051 --> 57:36.852
Terror is different.

57:36.854 --> 57:39.688
You can live in
terror, if you want.

57:39.690 --> 57:41.857
But me, I live in control.

57:41.859 --> 57:46.929
Because cycles like this
just make me dizzy.

57:46.931 --> 57:49.731
And a dizzy man
can't stay focused.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.669
And I'm focused.

57:57.775 --> 57:59.875
And I am not a sellout.

58:51.729 --> 58:53.996
How you doing?

58:53.998 --> 58:56.632
Never better.

58:56.634 --> 58:59.134
You heard about the Rouge
officer reports today?

58:59.136 --> 59:00.802
Harassing civilians?

59:03.307 --> 59:05.574
Yeah. How's Franklin?

59:05.576 --> 59:08.777
Embarrassed mostly. He
didn't see a thing.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.245
He got choked out from behind.

59:10.247 --> 59:13.715
Woke up cuffed and
without his uniform.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.651
In a dumpster.

59:18.656 --> 59:20.289
I can't imagine.

59:24.128 --> 59:26.895
He didn't see the guy but we're sure...
he's sure,

59:26.897 --> 59:30.832
the suspect was working with the two males
that he was questioning this morning.

59:30.834 --> 59:32.634
I see.

59:32.636 --> 59:34.436
He said that they tried
to contact their crew.

59:34.460 --> 59:38.941
He stopped it but it was too late.
Ambushed.

59:38.943 --> 59:41.043
I'm confused.

59:41.045 --> 59:43.812
Well. He had a couple of
teens he was questioning.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.582
They began to call for backup
when he got jumped from behind.

59:46.584 --> 59:49.318
Yeah, no, I got that but how
was he working with the kids?

59:49.320 --> 59:52.955
His uniform was gone.
Taken, they think.

59:55.759 --> 59:58.193
There's someone out there
dressed as an officer.

59:58.195 --> 01:00:03.765
I know.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.867
I was hoping that you
might know why someone

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:08.637
would go as far as
dressing as a cop

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:10.772
and making up a car to look...

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.708
I could think of a
lot of reasons.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:16.778
That's why I thought to ask you.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.380
I'm glad you understand.

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:21.183
You would have a
better idea being...

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:26.021
What? Being black?

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:29.791
It's a harsh reality.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.860
- We.
- Sorry?

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:34.963
We would have a better idea.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.132
Being black.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.900
I mean, unless you're not now.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:48.810
- It was a male.
- Right.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:54.916
Are we done?

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.687
Uh. Yeah. Of course.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.355
Sorry about that,
I didn't mean...

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:02.958
All good. I will
keep an eye out.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.031
Careful out there.

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.966
I know it must be strange.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.135
That's all you need is
people thinking it's you.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:16.171
Nah. We all look
the same, right?

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.839
I didn't mean it that way...

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.076
Cops. We all look the same.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:25.447
Right.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.948
Well, keep doing what you do.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.718
Oh, I plan to.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.694
Is it difficult?

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.862
Your first week?

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.865
I know mine was.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.867
It gets better.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.336
At one point you understand
what it's all for.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.142
Then when you do. Tell me.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.510
Possible 10-38 of a white sedan.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:30.479
Done up to look like
a police vehicle.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:33.882
ｶ I see every one of
the four centuries ｶ

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:36.004
ｶ sent through these generations
until it gets to me ｶ

01:02:36.028 --> 01:02:38.320
ｶ that psychological
weaponry accepting these ｶ

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:41.123
ｶ shackles on these ankles and
thinking it's feeling heavenly ｶ

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.458
ｶ I see it in a blue Iris ｶ

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.061
ｶ a new site I developed for
leading me to a new kindness ｶ

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.930
ｶ but instead it put dozens
of voices into my head ｶ

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.867
ｶ saying that, "maybe it's
time to choose violence" ｶ

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:56.371
ｶ then I believed in the logic and catching
the spirit I can see where it haunted ｶ

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:58.340
ｶ a murderous batch of
lyrics on a spree ｶ

01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:59.941
ｶ many targets want
to be pardoned ｶ

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.510
ｶ you notice how... ｶ.

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:03.178
Yeah, it was crazy.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.147
He was like, a super cop, man.

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:07.949
He came out of nowhere.
Then he let us go.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.631
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.820
Did you speak to him?

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:14.142
No, I'm smarter than that.
I was scared for my life.

01:03:14.144 --> 01:03:15.664
Even though he helped you.

01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:18.527
For sure. I mean,
he's a cop, right?

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:23.398
Fair enough, little brother.
Fair enough.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.001
Man, fuck them little niggas.

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:29.838
They'll never understand and they sure
as hell never going to respect you.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.242
You just go and you
do god's work, son.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:37.279
That's it, then.
You bellying up?

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:41.082
You going to let these people
on the radio get to you?

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:42.984
See that's the problem.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.488
We never get to them.
We do not get to them.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.157
I'm better than this.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.959
Better than what?

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.228
I'm better than this.
We're better than this.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:57.065
Man, get the fuck outta here.
What, hmm?

01:03:57.067 --> 01:04:00.535
You afraid to hurt someone?

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:02.070
Please.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.972
Just get out.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:08.977
Oh. Don't get self-righteous
on me now, cupcake.

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:12.347
You started this.
You gonna run away?

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.016
Mm-mmm. You're in too deep.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.586
- Man, you live for this shit.
- No.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:22.457
God damn. You are
not a good cop.

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.027
Hell, you're not
even a good person.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:29.030
You steal. You're bitter.
You're an asshole.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:32.300
Man, this shit is not
gonna make you a Saint.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:36.972
For once you get some balls and
you hide them with your tail.

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:41.409
Oh, man.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.414
Get mad!

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.050
God damn it, I like
you when you get mad.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.186
You think better
when you're mad.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:54.155
What else you got
to be mad about?

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:04.399
Get the fuck out.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.134
Get out!

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.670
What? So what?

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:11.006
You gonna kill a nigger now?

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.095
Do the real work, brother.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:41.269
Permission to be dismissed?

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.207
You just broke my cellphone.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:29.617
I can't breathe.

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.386
I know.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:34.589
How's that shoe feel?

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:37.625
You refused to answer
any of my questions.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.527
You. You're. You're-

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:43.098
I'm a police officer
and you're a doctor.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.067
Stop swinging my arm..

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.108
Ahhh! What are you doing?

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.611
I'll get back to the car.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.047
- Get back in the car!
- I need to know what's going on.

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:03.184
Don't make another fucking move!

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.153
Don't shoot.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:09.024
I just want to go home. Just
let me go home, please.

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:21.669
Fucked up.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.478
Jesus.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.217
You okay?

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.334
Red vintage bike.

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:34.475
"No left handle tape".
You little motherfucker.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.900
Don't.

01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:17.739
I don't know if you're sick on
something, but don't smile.

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:20.675
Don't flinch, don't move.

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:35.623
Easy.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.976
I could give you 20 reasons
why I wanted to be a cop...

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:09.490
Imagine if I approached a
paraplegic assault victim and said,

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.492
"you should have walked away."

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:14.495
Imagine if I said to the
person who was on fire,

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.864
"stay calm."

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:19.434
Imagine if I said to
the drowning boy,

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:22.403
"stop struggling, you're
making it worse."

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:25.606
Imagine if I said to
the person choking,

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:29.711
"just breathe, it will pass."

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:34.082
Imagine if I said to
the autistic girl,

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:38.519
"there is no excuse for
all that frustration."

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.522
I mean, imagine...

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.425
If I said to the mother,

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:48.029
"there are better ways to
grieve over your child."

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.899
Imagine if I said to
the aboriginal woman,

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:55.536
"what about the other
girls that went missing?"

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:59.407
Imagine if I said to the person
who fell from the ladder,

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.809
"that wouldn't have happened if
you weren't up there though."

01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:06.414
Imagine if I said to the
long term cancer patient,

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:09.550
"you should read this
information about cancer."

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.787
Imagine if I said to
the pregnant woman,

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:17.558
"oh yeah, I know exactly how
that feels, it's like when..."

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.496
Imagine if I said
to the soldier,

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:24.799
"don't shoot back, and
try and talk to him."

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:28.069
Imagine if I said
to the American,

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:31.572
"what does 9-11 have
to do with you?"

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.842
Imagine if I said to the
journalist's family,

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:37.478
"he took the job
knowing the risk."

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.750
I mean, imagine if I said
to patient in the er:

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.952
"You're better than this."

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:47.922
Imagine if I said to the child,

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.858
"I expect better from you."

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.694
Imagine if I said to
the homeless person,

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:56.130
"well, if I were you..."

01:13:56.132 --> 01:14:01.035
Imagine if I said to
the battered woman,

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:05.807
"by talking about abuse,
you are the abuser."

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.575
Imagine if I said,

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:09.977
"yeah but that happens
to everyone."

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:16.584
Imagine if I did this
all day every day.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.688
Did you kill anybody?

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.859
Not literally.

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:27.161
I looked at you today,
know what I saw?

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:28.896
Beats me.

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:31.466
I saw someone I thought
I could relate to.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:33.701
Not someone keeping a tally
on arrested black kids,

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:36.637
and then turning around harassing
other people like a video game.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:37.872
- White people.
- What?

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:40.575
White people.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:44.645
You can't even say it.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.981
It was white people.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.984
Although there was a
Korean in there somewhere.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.653
I'm pretty sure. I
can't really tell.

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:59.927
Oh, my god. You think
this is funny.

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.997
You don't deserve to
wear that uniform.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.665
You sick bastard.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.069
I appreciate that, thank you.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:09.904
I don't like what you're on...

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:13.174
You keep talking
about what I'm on.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:16.210
See, what I'm on is the job.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:20.681
The payroll. Alert. Duty. Edge.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.751
The streets. My streets.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.887
I play it smart out here.

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:30.758
I know my shit. I
patrol my shit.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.927
I keep order on my shit.

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.962
I crack down on the shit.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.835
Why do I do that? Huh?

01:15:40.837 --> 01:15:44.839
Why do I crack down
on those black kids?

01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:48.042
Because if I don't do
it, someone else will.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.945
Somebody else will
get that thug.

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:54.715
Someone else will put
that nigger behind bars.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.652
Oh, so you better know
anytime I hear someone say,

01:15:57.654 --> 01:16:00.555
"suspect dark, black,

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:03.324
afro-whatever, even
slightly tanned..."

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:06.727
I put my foot on the gas, and drive
like my wife is having a baby

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.730
and I get there before anyone.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.666
And if someone else is there...

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:14.135
I make damn well sure
I do the talking,

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:16.737
the breathing, the moving,

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:19.106
the guessing, the
questioning, everything.

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:23.578
Because if I do not do
it, someone else will.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.247
So I take the blame.
I take the names.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:29.216
I take the hate. Because
that is my job.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.761
Get out of here.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.604
You're letting me go?

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.739
I'm giving you a head start.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.659
Hey, wait.

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:13.260
The one reason.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:15.796
You said there was one
reason you cared about.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:21.869
My dad.

01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:26.073
He was cop.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.142
Ain't that some shit?

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:30.391
Hey, good news. We
found your bike.

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:36.263
Okay, but what the
hell happened?

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:37.965
My best guess

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:41.001
is a car backed over
it a few times.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:42.503
A car backed over it.

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:46.307
Yeah, but the lock
still looks great.

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:49.476
Who... who the hell would that?

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:52.079
People are assholes, I guess.

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:02.189
Tire pressure's still great..

01:21:09.018 --> 01:21:10.898
You're listening to
the liberation room.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.033
We are all dedication,
all night.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.935
Who are you sending
this one out to?

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.872
- Echo 97.
- And what do you want to say?

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:21.041
You're right. Third
day is a charm.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:24.211
All right, echo 97, keep
it real, keep it right.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.414
This one's for you...

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:36.957
ｶ options, options ｶ

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:41.328
ｶ my brother there are
so many options ｶ

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.931
ｶ other than the
ones you chose ｶ

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:46.100
ｶ nobody's fault but your own ｶ

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:47.601
yo, I did my best.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:51.238
Hmmm...

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.674
Did you?

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:57.278
ｶ go on and do what
you gotta do say ｶ

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:02.182
ｶ I can't change the past ｶ

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.585
ｶ but I can change the present ｶ

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:07.922
- ｶ and the future in my...
- ｶ -

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:05.145
Hi, um, my name is Andre

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:08.148
and I am really unapologetically
black sometimes.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.684
The side effects of being
unapologetically black

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.720
include people removing
you from Facebook

01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:15.022
because you post too
much black stuff.

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:16.690
People think you're
oversensitive

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:18.592
because you don't sideline
your own oppression.

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:20.474
But one thing I've learned
about white fragility

01:23:20.498 --> 01:23:22.229
means that you live
in a glass house.

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.231
Throwing stones at those
who are already shattered.

01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.432
Like this one time

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.368
I was out to brunch
with a few friends

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.290
and, of course, I was the
only black person there

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:31.393
so they felt they needed to
ask their local black man

01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:33.440
what is and what isn't racist.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.409
Until Sam kept saying
she didn't see race.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:37.644
You see, I wanted to
shut that shit down

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:39.513
but Sam was the one
that drove me out there

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.248
and I kind of needed that drive.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.183
Or like that one
time Chris told me

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.219
I was playing the race
card when I told him

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.154
I got stopped and frisked.

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:49.276
Or when Quinn said that if I
just respected the police

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.125
then none of this
would be happening.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.193
But you know, maybe I'll
use this poem to tell you

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:55.062
about the time I've been
stopped and frisked.

01:23:55.064 --> 01:23:57.064
Or maybe this is the
poem where I tell you

01:23:57.066 --> 01:23:59.199
that tokenism is not diversity.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:02.336
Or maybe this the poem where
I tell you how scared I am.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:05.205
Or the one where I make a metaphor
comparing them to tamir rice.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:08.208
And I'm Mike brown. And
my mom's Sandra bland.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.077
And my dad's Oscar Grant.

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.645
And we're just trying
to play house.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:14.348
But, I mean, here I
am blacksplaining.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.116
Or half blacksplaining,
as Chris would say.

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:17.785
Because considering he's
dating a black woman

01:24:17.787 --> 01:24:19.686
means he can judge someone's
blackness, right?

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:21.622
And, I mean, unlike him, I
just can't turn off the radio

01:24:21.624 --> 01:24:23.390
when I'm done feeling
black for the day.

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.492
I just can't switch from
hip hop to rock n' roll

01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:27.294
because I would be breaking
my own stereotype.

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.196
But people don't like
hearing these poems.

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:31.532
People want to hear poems
that aren't a clich・

01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:34.234
but I'm a clich・right here because
I've written this poem before.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:36.270
This is a poem I'm
still writing.

01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:37.838
This is a poem that should never
be finished in my lifetime.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.673
And here I am,
expressing my pain

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:41.208
in one of the only
platforms I have

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.410
to see if I can be validated.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:46.052
But I have to keep performing this
poem for the people in the back.

01:24:46.076 --> 01:24:49.116
I'll perform this poem until
black bodies are looked at

01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:51.251
as humans before
they are weapons.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.693
Until I can stop looking in the
mirror and thinking it was me.

01:24:53.717 --> 01:24:56.223
Until I can stop being asked
to police my own blackness.

01:24:56.225 --> 01:24:58.392
Without me being the
dead kid in the room.

01:24:58.394 --> 01:25:01.095
I'll perform this
poem again and again.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:05.265
And again, until I find the
words I am looking for.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.667
But until then,

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:10.170
you'll hear this poem again.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:32.359
This is the roost,

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.162
where the topics are hot,
but the issues are chilly.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:38.165
Now that the jury is out,
it's time to call in.

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:40.534
We want to hear your
thoughts on the verdict.

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:43.637
Get at your girl.
Who's talking to me?

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:49.209
ｶ I can see no devil
in the field ｶ

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.614
ｶ just many trees and
papa's many seeds ｶ

01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:59.620
ｶ I can see no devil

01:25:59.622 --> 01:26:04.691
ｶ come on down come on down ｶ

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:10.164

ｶ just many trees and

ｶ come on down come on down ｶ

ｶ and as the house
will burn and rust ｶ

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:49.369
ｶ we will discern
the lives we lost ｶ

01:26:58.347 --> 01:27:02.983
ｶ I can see no devil

01:27:02.985 --> 01:27:08.789

ｶ come on down come on down ｶ

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.636
- ｶ I've been wrong ｶ
- ｶ I've been wrong ｶ

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:35.415
ｶ I've been beat
admitted defeat ｶ

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.418
ｶ they'll take me away ｶ

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.955
ｶ on this cursed day ｶ

01:27:54.003 --> 01:27:59.373
ｶ and as the house
will burn and rust ｶ

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:03.043

ｶ and as the house

ｶ we will discern

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.538
ｶ I see everyone of
the four centuries ｶ

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.773
ｶ sent through these generations
until it gets to me ｶ

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:08.709
ｶ that psychological weaponry ｶ

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:10.677
ｶ accepting these shackles
on these ankles ｶ

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:12.159
ｶ and thinking it's
feeling heavenly ｶ

01:29:12.183 --> 01:29:13.714
ｶ I see it in a blue Iris ｶ

01:29:13.716 --> 01:29:15.449
ｶ a new site I developed ｶ

01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.451
ｶ for leading me to
a new kindness ｶ

01:29:17.453 --> 01:29:19.853
ｶ but instead it put dozens
of voices into my head ｶ

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:22.455
ｶ they keep on saying that, "maybe
it's time to choose violence" ｶ

01:29:22.479 --> 01:29:24.524
ｶ then I believed in the
logic and responded ｶ

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:26.760
ｶ catching the spirit I
can see what it haunted ｶ

01:29:26.762 --> 01:29:28.528
ｶ a murderous batch of
lyrics on a spree ｶ

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.464
ｶ many targets wanna
be pardoned ｶ

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.186
ｶ they notice how I'm
beasting the harvest ｶ

01:29:32.188 --> 01:29:33.828
ｶ I wouldn't have made
it to the present ｶ

01:29:33.852 --> 01:29:35.802
ｶ without that part of me ｶ

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:37.964
ｶ limitless source of energy
pumping into my arteries ｶ

01:29:37.988 --> 01:29:40.073
ｶ but when it's such a
coincidence in this lottery ｶ

01:29:40.075 --> 01:29:42.409
ｶ complacency becomes
a lobotomy ｶ

01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:44.611
ｶ who could've ever known that

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:47.774
ｶ didn't think that I
deserved your respect ｶ
