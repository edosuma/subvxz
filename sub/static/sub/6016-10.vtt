00:03.811 --> 00:05.471
There's no easy way
to break up.

00:05.646 --> 00:07.773
When you start dating,
they ought to give you...

00:07.948 --> 00:09.745
..."Get out of Relationship Free"
cards.

00:09.917 --> 00:12.681
You know what I mean? So you
could just go up to the person...

00:12.853 --> 00:14.445
...and go, "Here you go. I'm sorry.

00:14.622 --> 00:17.147
I'll grab the tennis racket.
Don't even bother to get up.

00:17.324 --> 00:19.315
Have a good one. Sorry."

00:19.493 --> 00:22.462
Which is fine, unless the person
you're in the relationship with...

00:22.630 --> 00:26.031
...has a "Eight More Months of Guilt,
Torture and Pain" card.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.661
"Hold it. I got a little something
for you."

00:34.642 --> 00:35.973
- We're dead.
- We're not dead.

00:36.143 --> 00:37.576
- We are dead.
- Come on.

00:37.745 --> 00:39.679
We got all day tomorrow
to think of a story.

00:39.847 --> 00:42.577
All day tomorrow? We had a month
to come up with something.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.377
We didn't do anything.

00:44.652 --> 00:46.517
So we'll do it tomorrow.

00:46.787 --> 00:49.119
Let me ask you: when's the last time
you went skiing?

00:49.557 --> 00:50.785
About six years ago.

00:51.458 --> 00:54.689
I think you can take the lift ticket
off your jacket now.

00:55.296 --> 00:57.423
Women like skiers.

00:57.598 --> 01:00.123
So what? You can't meet anybody.
You're with Susan.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.203
Yeah. Right.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.762
See those two women over there?

01:05.940 --> 01:09.034
I almost dated the one on the right.
She's in the closet business.

01:09.209 --> 01:11.074
Closet business?

01:11.245 --> 01:13.975
- What's the closet business?
- What is it your business?

01:14.915 --> 01:17.816
- I'm interested.
- She reorganizes your closet...

01:17.985 --> 01:21.045
...and shows you how to maximize
your closet space.

01:21.221 --> 01:22.449
She looked into my closet.

01:22.856 --> 01:25.552
You thought she was good-looking.
This was a way to meet her.

01:26.226 --> 01:28.660
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what happened?

01:28.829 --> 01:31.024
She mentioned she had
a boyfriend. Then it hit me:

01:31.198 --> 01:33.689
What do I need
more closet space for?

01:35.002 --> 01:37.732
- Hi, Marla.
- Jerry.

01:37.905 --> 01:39.133
- George, Marla.
- Marla.

01:39.306 --> 01:40.967
George. Jerry, Stacy.

01:41.141 --> 01:42.665
- Stacy. George, Stacy.
- Jerry.

01:42.843 --> 01:44.401
- Stacy.
- George.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.710
George.

01:48.882 --> 01:51.851
Jerry, Marla. Stacy.

01:54.888 --> 01:58.984
- So, how was your trip to Berlin?
- Trip to Berlin?

01:59.159 --> 02:01.252
Remember, that's why you
put off the closets.

02:01.428 --> 02:02.952
You said you were going to Berlin.

02:03.130 --> 02:05.064
Oh, right, right.

02:05.232 --> 02:07.894
The Wall had just come down.
You told me you wanted to be...

02:08.068 --> 02:09.295
...part of the celebration.

02:09.470 --> 02:12.735
Yes, yes, I did, but you know,
I was watching it on CNN...

02:12.906 --> 02:17.502
...and they covered it so well, I thought,
why knock my brains out?

02:17.678 --> 02:19.202
You know, my boyfriend went.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.644
- Really?
- Yes, I told him all about you going...

02:21.815 --> 02:24.045
...and he got all excited
and decided to go.

02:24.218 --> 02:26.948
- Oh, did he like it?
- I don't know. He never came back.

02:27.421 --> 02:30.390
Anyway, we met with NBC
about a month ago, and they...

02:30.557 --> 02:33.082
...gave us the green light
to go ahead and write a pilot.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.989
We got a big meeting
with them tomorrow.

02:35.162 --> 02:37.460
They gotta approve the story
before we can write it.

02:37.865 --> 02:42.632
Wow. What a great job. A writer.

02:42.803 --> 02:45.499
Not a bad way to earn a buck.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.004
Sounds great.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.142
Well, I'll tell you, Stacy...

02:49.309 --> 02:51.777
...it's a lot of hard work.

02:51.945 --> 02:54.470
But it comes fairly easy to me.

02:55.315 --> 02:58.580
Some people write symphonies.
This is my gift.

03:04.191 --> 03:07.160
- So you gonna go out with her?
- I might.

03:07.594 --> 03:10.188
- What about Susan?
- What? I'm not married.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.525
I'm not allowed to go out
with somebody else?

03:12.700 --> 03:14.133
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

03:14.301 --> 03:16.394
- On many factors.
- Like what?

03:16.570 --> 03:19.698
Well, how long
you've been seeing her.

03:19.873 --> 03:22.433
What's your phone-call frequency?
Are you on a daily?

03:22.609 --> 03:25.578
No. Semi-daily. Four,
five times a week.

03:25.746 --> 03:28.510
Saturday nights, do you ask her out,
or is the date implied?

03:29.650 --> 03:31.140
- Implied.
- She got anything...

03:31.318 --> 03:32.546
...in your medicine cabinet?

03:33.187 --> 03:35.587
Might be some moisturizer.

03:37.257 --> 03:39.191
Let me ask you this:

03:39.359 --> 03:42.123
Is there any Tampax in your house?

03:47.234 --> 03:49.099
Yeah.

03:49.903 --> 03:51.632
- I'll tell you what you got here.
- Yeah?

03:51.805 --> 03:53.033
You got a girlfriend.

03:53.207 --> 03:56.267
Oh, no, no. What...?
Are you sure, a girlfriend?

03:56.443 --> 03:59.435
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily,
with Tampax in his house...

03:59.613 --> 04:02.013
...and an implied date
on Saturday night.

04:02.182 --> 04:05.640
- I would like to help you out, but...
- Do you believe my luck?

04:05.819 --> 04:07.878
The first time I have a good answer to...

04:08.055 --> 04:10.046
..."What do you do?"
and I have a girlfriend.

04:10.557 --> 04:12.889
You don't need a girlfriend
when you can answer that.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.187
That's what you say
in order to get girlfriends.

04:15.362 --> 04:19.389
Once you can get girlfriends,
you just want more girlfriends.

04:19.565 --> 04:22.660
You're gonna make
a very good father someday.

04:23.203 --> 04:25.501
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.

04:25.672 --> 04:27.537
That's it. I'm getting out
of this thing.

04:27.808 --> 04:30.003
Break up with her.
But you know what this means.

04:30.177 --> 04:32.304
- No, what?
- The script, the pilot, the TV show.

04:32.479 --> 04:34.106
- That's all over.
- What do you mean?

04:34.281 --> 04:36.272
Figure it out. She's one
of the executives...

04:36.450 --> 04:39.476
...that's gonna make the decision
whether or not they pick up the show.

04:39.653 --> 04:41.018
She's one of our biggest fans.

04:41.789 --> 04:43.780
You drop her, you think
they're gonna pick us up?

04:43.957 --> 04:47.484
Oh, right. Oh, no! Man.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.096
You know, it's a very
interesting situation.

04:50.264 --> 04:52.960
Here you have a job that could
help you get girls.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.998
But you also have a relationship.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.967
But if you get rid of the
relationship so you can get girls...

04:58.138 --> 05:00.003
...you lose the job.

05:01.074 --> 05:04.100
- You see the irony?
- Yeah, yeah. I see the...

05:05.412 --> 05:06.709
All right, what about this?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.212
What if I could find some way
to break up with her...

05:09.383 --> 05:12.216
...so that she'll still like me,
and it doesn't affect the deal?

05:12.386 --> 05:14.013
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hear me out.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.713
Hear me out. Don't dismiss this.
You're quick to dismiss.

05:16.890 --> 05:18.619
Don't dismiss.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.124
She's got a big crush on
David Letterman. I mean, a big crush.

05:23.297 --> 05:24.787
She talks about him all the time.

05:25.465 --> 05:28.059
Suppose I go up to
David Letterman.

05:28.235 --> 05:31.932
He works at NBC. I work at NBC.

05:32.105 --> 05:33.538
I explain my situation.

05:33.707 --> 05:36.767
He agrees to meet her. They go out.
They fall madly in love...

05:36.944 --> 05:39.845
...and she dumps me
for David Letterman.

05:40.180 --> 05:43.877
- This is your plan?
- No, no, I'm just thinking.

05:44.051 --> 05:46.246
I don't think you are.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.318
Well, let me tell you what I see.

05:55.562 --> 05:58.326
Please. And be brutal.
I have no closet sensitivity.

05:59.366 --> 06:03.598
- Are you very fussy about your pants?
- I don't think I am.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.328
Because I have a very radical idea.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.200
- Can you handle it?
- Try me.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.700
Here's what I'm proposing.
We'll eliminate all this.

06:10.878 --> 06:15.838
The hangers, the bar, the shelves, and
in its place, install a series of hooks.

06:16.149 --> 06:18.083
We'll put everything on hooks.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.913
- Everything?
- Everything.

06:20.087 --> 06:23.181
The shirts, pants,
sports jackets, pajamas.

06:23.357 --> 06:25.848
We can get 80 hooks on here.

06:26.159 --> 06:28.024
You're quite mad, you know.

06:31.698 --> 06:34.030
Oh, I don't believe this.

06:34.534 --> 06:36.263
Hey. Well, what are you doing?

06:36.436 --> 06:38.165
I'm watching
The Bold and the Beautiful.

06:38.338 --> 06:39.896
- No.
- Wait, wait.

06:40.073 --> 06:41.802
- This is not a good time.
- Five minutes.

06:41.975 --> 06:43.806
What did you give your TV
to George for?

06:43.977 --> 06:47.435
Because I've been watching too much.
It was an addiction. I couldn't stop.

06:47.614 --> 06:49.411
It was destroying my brain cells.

06:50.784 --> 06:52.615
Yeah, but now you're in here
all the time.

06:52.786 --> 06:54.048
Well... Whoa.

06:54.221 --> 06:55.620
- Marla, Kramer.
- Hello.

06:58.392 --> 07:01.384
- Go out. It's nice out.
- There's nothing out there for me.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.461
- There's weather.
- I don't need weather.

07:03.630 --> 07:04.927
Weather doesn't do it for me.

07:05.098 --> 07:07.032
I'm telling George to give you
your TV back.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.828
No, no. I don't want it back.

07:10.003 --> 07:12.062
Are you gonna watch
the Knick game tonight?

07:12.239 --> 07:14.230
- I don't know.
- Will you tape it?

07:14.408 --> 07:17.673
- Kramer.
- Oh, yeah.

07:24.952 --> 07:27.443
So your boyfriend never
came back from Berlin.

07:27.621 --> 07:30.146
- Never came back.
- Oh, you must have been devastated...

07:30.324 --> 07:31.655
...being left for a wall.

07:31.825 --> 07:33.122
Well...

07:33.560 --> 07:35.425
...it was about to end anyway.

07:35.595 --> 07:38.223
There was this problem.

07:38.865 --> 07:40.457
Excuse me one second.

07:40.634 --> 07:41.862
- Yeah.
- It's me.

07:42.035 --> 07:43.866
Come on up.

07:44.371 --> 07:46.305
That's Elaine. She's just
a friend of mine.

07:46.473 --> 07:48.270
I don't know what
she's doing here now.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.342
I'm sorry.

07:50.510 --> 07:53.138
- What?
- I didn't get it.

07:57.117 --> 07:58.982
So you were saying
there was this problem.

07:59.152 --> 08:01.712
Well, he wanted me
to move in with him.

08:01.888 --> 08:03.913
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

08:05.158 --> 08:08.616
- Go on.
- Well, I wouldn't move in, because...

08:08.795 --> 08:10.786
- Yes?
- Well, because...

08:10.964 --> 08:14.422
- Yeah?
- Well, because I'm a...

08:14.601 --> 08:16.034
...virgin.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.962
Hello.

08:19.506 --> 08:21.906
Hi. Marla, Elaine.

08:22.075 --> 08:23.736
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

08:23.910 --> 08:27.004
- I wanted to return your tape.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Two weeks late.

08:27.180 --> 08:30.980
Now it cost me $35 to see Havana.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.979
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just kept forgetting.

08:36.155 --> 08:38.147
- I should be going.
- No, no, no. I'm leaving.

08:38.325 --> 08:39.883
I like that thing in your hair.

08:40.059 --> 08:41.652
Yeah? This woman
was selling them...

08:41.828 --> 08:44.023
...at this crazy party
I was at last night.

08:44.531 --> 08:46.192
You'll appreciate this. Snapple?

08:46.366 --> 08:48.163
No, thanks.

08:49.603 --> 08:52.163
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

08:52.339 --> 08:53.636
...my purse on the sofa.

08:53.807 --> 08:57.436
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.277
So I just froze, you know:

09:03.450 --> 09:06.078
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

09:06.253 --> 09:08.244
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

09:08.422 --> 09:11.050
...she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so I mean...

09:11.224 --> 09:13.454
...big deal, right?

09:13.627 --> 09:16.323
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

09:16.496 --> 09:18.487
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

09:18.665 --> 09:20.690
...that women carry around
their diaphragms.

09:22.235 --> 09:24.032
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

09:30.944 --> 09:32.707
I should be going.

09:32.879 --> 09:36.815
- So we'll talk about the hooks then.
- Yes.

09:39.019 --> 09:42.887
- What, was it something I said?
- She's a virgin. She just told me.

09:43.056 --> 09:46.719
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.

09:51.164 --> 09:52.893
Well, you think I should
say something?

09:53.066 --> 09:54.658
Should I say something, apologize?

09:54.835 --> 09:56.996
- Was I being anti-virgin?
- No, no.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.365
- I mean...
- Because I'm not anti-virgin.

09:59.539 --> 10:03.202
- I'm gonna... I'll be right back.
- Don't... Elaine. Elaine.

10:03.376 --> 10:05.537
- Yeah?
- It's George.

10:06.713 --> 10:09.546
- She's a virgin?
- A virgin.

10:11.118 --> 10:12.779
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

10:12.953 --> 10:16.286
I'm very attracted to her.
That accent is so sexy.

10:16.456 --> 10:18.788
I don't think I could do it.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.757
They always remember
the first time.

10:21.928 --> 10:24.590
I don't wanna be remembered.
I wanna be forgotten.

10:25.265 --> 10:28.063
You need a little pioneer spirit.
You don't have any of that...

10:28.235 --> 10:30.100
...Lewis and Clark in you.

10:30.971 --> 10:34.031
You know, sometimes those guys
don't make it back.

10:37.444 --> 10:39.002
- I'm really hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

10:39.179 --> 10:41.340
We gotta get something.
I don't wanna go...

10:41.515 --> 10:43.346
...on an empty stomach.
Let's get Chinese.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.213
- Wanna order?
- All right, then we gotta get work done.

10:46.386 --> 10:49.378
Let me just call Kramer.
See if he wants anything.

10:50.457 --> 10:52.220
Hey. We're ordering Chinese food.

10:52.392 --> 10:54.189
If you want anything,
let me know what...

10:54.361 --> 10:57.524
...and I'll order it...

10:57.697 --> 10:59.790
...for you.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.991
- I'm in. Let's go for it.
- All right. What do you want?

11:03.303 --> 11:04.634
- I don't care.
- All right.

11:04.804 --> 11:06.795
Why don't we get a couple of
dishes and share.

11:06.973 --> 11:08.463
- All right.
- What are you getting?

11:08.775 --> 11:11.175
- I think I'm gonna get a chow fun.
- What's a chow fun?

11:11.344 --> 11:13.141
It's a broad noodle.

11:13.313 --> 11:16.476
- What do you mean "a broad noodle"?
- It's a big, flat noodle.

11:16.783 --> 11:19.183
Well, I don't want a big, flat noodle.

11:20.487 --> 11:23.012
- What kind of noodle do you want?
- Who says I want a noodle?

11:24.191 --> 11:26.557
I'm getting the chow fun.
You don't have to have any.

11:26.726 --> 11:29.422
I'll get the pea pods, and you can't
have any of my pea pods.

11:30.397 --> 11:32.888
- Fine.
- And get extra MSG.

11:36.369 --> 11:41.500
Look, Marla, this whole sex thing
is totally overrated.

11:42.075 --> 11:44.305
Now, the one thing
you've gotta be ready for...

11:44.477 --> 11:48.846
...is how the man changes into
a completely different person...

11:49.015 --> 11:50.505
...five seconds after it's over.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.644
I mean, something happens
to their personality.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.947
It's really quite astounding. It's like...

11:56.122 --> 11:59.683
...they committed a crime and wanna
flee the scene before police get there.

12:01.228 --> 12:03.719
- So they just leave?
- Yeah. Pretty much, yeah.

12:03.897 --> 12:08.527
Well, the smart ones start working
on their getaway stories during dinner.

12:08.702 --> 12:11.296
How, you know, they gotta
get up early tomorrow.

12:11.471 --> 12:13.336
It's always about being up early.

12:13.506 --> 12:15.371
They all turn into farmers suddenly.

12:16.743 --> 12:19.109
It must be really good
to put up with all that.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.877
Let's go. We don't have time
before the meeting.

12:26.052 --> 12:27.485
The food. What happened to Ping?

12:27.654 --> 12:30.122
Don't worry, he'll be here.
Look, we only got two hours.

12:30.290 --> 12:33.851
We need to come up with one good
idea, we can get through this meeting.

12:34.261 --> 12:36.286
There's your food.

12:36.463 --> 12:38.055
Hey, what about this?

12:38.231 --> 12:41.325
I'm in a car accident.
The motorist is uninsured.

12:41.501 --> 12:43.230
- You with me?
- Yeah.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.199
My car's totaled.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.636
It's all his fault. Now, he has
absolutely no money.

12:47.807 --> 12:50.105
There is no way
that he could pay me.

12:50.277 --> 12:52.507
So the judge decrees...

12:52.679 --> 12:54.271
...that he becomes my butler.

12:55.882 --> 12:57.474
- Your butler?
- Right.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.677
He cooks my food, cleans my house,
does my shopping, there you go.

13:00.854 --> 13:02.446
That's your program.

13:03.156 --> 13:04.418
- What about me?
- Don't worry.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.616
We find something for you.

13:08.995 --> 13:11.395
That's the stupidest idea
I ever heard.

13:11.564 --> 13:14.624
Sentenced to be a butler.

13:15.735 --> 13:17.999
- Ping, what happened?
- There was an accident.

13:18.171 --> 13:19.934
Head hurts.

13:20.106 --> 13:23.837
- Head really hurts.
- What happened?

13:24.311 --> 13:27.212
Marla and I went out for coffee,
and I was crossing the street...

13:27.380 --> 13:30.349
...and he was biking towards me,
so I got out of the way in time...

13:30.517 --> 13:32.644
...but he ran into a parked car,
hit his head...

13:32.819 --> 13:34.150
...and everything went flying.

13:34.321 --> 13:36.448
Something happened to the food?

13:37.023 --> 13:38.422
Could only save one bag.

13:38.591 --> 13:40.650
Should I call an ambulance?
Wanna see a doctor?

13:40.827 --> 13:42.590
I'll get some ice.

13:42.762 --> 13:45.492
The pea pods? All you saved
was the pea pods?

13:45.932 --> 13:47.524
- Hey, you got the food?
- Yeah, here.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.601
Man, what took you so long?
Hey, Ping.

13:49.803 --> 13:51.862
- Kramer.
- Yeah.

13:52.639 --> 13:54.800
- Where's yours?
- He dropped it.

13:54.974 --> 13:57.875
Oh, that's too bad.

13:58.044 --> 14:01.013
You should slow down, you know.
It's dangerous to go that fast.

14:01.181 --> 14:03.376
No, no, I have green light.
You jaywalk.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.484
- Are you watching Oprah?
- I did not jaywalk.

14:05.652 --> 14:07.017
You're giving him back that TV.

14:07.187 --> 14:08.916
- Yes, you jaywalk.
- No, I don't want it.

14:09.089 --> 14:11.023
Jaywalker. I can slap a suit on you.

14:11.191 --> 14:12.419
- What?
- We've got work to do.

14:12.592 --> 14:15.060
- What about the meeting?
- An hour with Patrick Swayze.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.725
A month and a half we had.
We did nothing.

14:22.902 --> 14:25.462
We put it off until today.
Then we couldn't do anything...

14:25.638 --> 14:27.833
...because Elaine runs
to apologize to a virgin...

14:28.007 --> 14:31.443
...crosses against the light and
knocks over a Chinese delivery boy.

14:31.611 --> 14:34.409
And now we're gonna go make
fools of ourselves. We got nothing.

14:34.581 --> 14:38.142
You're not even in show business.
I got a reputation.

14:38.318 --> 14:40.843
You're dragging me into
the sewer with you.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.215
I've been on TV, buddy boy.

14:43.390 --> 14:47.588
You know how fast word spreads
in show business? Just like that:

14:47.761 --> 14:50.889
One bad impression,
you're out of the business!

14:51.097 --> 14:53.065
Let's postpone it.
Let's get out of here.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.564
What? They know we're here.

14:54.734 --> 14:58.397
I'll fake an illness. My back!
My back! I can't move my back!

14:58.571 --> 14:59.936
No, no. Would you get up?

15:00.106 --> 15:02.438
- I could do this, Jerry.
- No.

15:02.609 --> 15:05.100
All right, I'll tell them
that my sister died.

15:05.278 --> 15:07.405
My poor sister died.

15:07.580 --> 15:10.378
She was standing on the street,
and then she was laughing...

15:10.550 --> 15:12.984
...and then they shot her!

15:13.153 --> 15:15.280
That's the kind of a sick city
we're living in!

15:15.455 --> 15:17.286
They shoot you for laughing!

15:17.457 --> 15:20.119
I must go and comfort my poor family.
Jerry, come on.

15:20.293 --> 15:23.729
Take me home so I can comfort my...
My poor family.

15:24.230 --> 15:25.857
- What?
- That's David Letterman.

15:26.032 --> 15:27.829
I just saw David Letterman walk by.

15:28.868 --> 15:30.961
Be right back.

15:31.137 --> 15:32.866
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready
for you now.

15:36.609 --> 15:40.739
Yes, I was very wise
to hitch my wagon to his star.

15:45.485 --> 15:46.918
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

15:47.086 --> 15:48.610
How you doing?
Nice to see you all.

15:48.788 --> 15:51.882
- Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

15:52.058 --> 15:54.458
- Where's Russell?
- He had to go to L.A.

15:54.627 --> 15:56.356
There's a problem on the set
at Blossom.

15:56.696 --> 16:00.530
Oh, poor Blossom.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.600
Anyway, he asked me
to sit in for him.

16:03.369 --> 16:04.358
Where's George?

16:04.537 --> 16:06.437
He ran to say something
to David Letterman.

16:06.673 --> 16:09.369
- David Letterman's on the floor?
- Yeah, he just walked by.

16:11.444 --> 16:14.311
I think we should
get started, anyway.

16:14.581 --> 16:16.549
Yeah. Good idea.

16:16.816 --> 16:18.943
- So how are you guys coming along?
- Good. Good.

16:19.118 --> 16:21.348
We've got a number of ideas.

16:21.521 --> 16:22.886
Good.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.354
Have you been to
a Chinese restaurant...

16:27.527 --> 16:30.291
...and they say five minutes
for a table, and you wind up...

16:30.463 --> 16:31.896
...waiting there for 30 minutes?

16:33.066 --> 16:36.058
Well, we thought it would be
very funny...

16:36.236 --> 16:37.863
...to do an entire show...

16:38.037 --> 16:40.369
...where all you're doing
is waiting for the table.

16:43.309 --> 16:46.244
Because we've all
been in that situation.

16:47.981 --> 16:51.348
You know, you're... You're waiting,
and you're hungry...

16:51.518 --> 16:54.510
...and you bump into somebody
you know.

16:59.058 --> 17:02.050
- When is Russell coming back?
- So that's the idea?

17:03.396 --> 17:05.057
Well, no. That's one.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.492
We have many others.

17:06.665 --> 17:08.327
We have an idea where...

17:10.403 --> 17:13.998
l... I get into an accident with a guy
who has no insurance...

17:14.173 --> 17:16.539
...and the judge sentences him
to be my butler.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.306
You know, and he cooks.
He has to cook for me.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.507
And cleans my house...

17:24.684 --> 17:26.845
...and he's doing my shopping,
you know.

17:27.819 --> 17:31.347
And I'm walking around with
one of those big neck-collar things.

17:32.358 --> 17:34.383
Those collars are funny.

17:34.561 --> 17:37.621
You see somebody in one of those,
you start laughing immediately.

17:39.098 --> 17:40.895
Are you telling them
the butler story?

17:41.067 --> 17:43.331
Is that beautiful or what?

17:43.503 --> 17:45.027
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

17:45.405 --> 17:47.032
Russell?

17:48.474 --> 17:50.533
- I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, Rita.

17:50.710 --> 17:52.371
Hey, Mr. Schirmack. How are you?

17:52.545 --> 17:56.072
Good to see you, Stu and Jay.
Always a pleasure. Hi, sweetie.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.774
Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,
that's beautiful, isn't it?

17:58.952 --> 18:00.442
Is that a killer?

18:00.620 --> 18:02.850
- I thought I was getting the butler.
- Don't worry.

18:03.022 --> 18:04.455
We'll find something for you.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:13.032 --> 18:16.433
So Letterman didn't
spark to your idea, huh?

18:16.803 --> 18:19.203
He said there was nothing
he could do and next time...

18:19.372 --> 18:21.932
...I should probably break
the Prozacs in half.

18:22.342 --> 18:24.469
Hey, wanna hold it down.
I'm watching JEOPARD Y!

18:24.644 --> 18:27.078
Would you give him back the TV?

18:27.380 --> 18:29.575
Oh, by the way, Susan called for you
a minute ago.

18:29.749 --> 18:32.684
I'll bet they're probably doing
somersaults about us over there.

18:32.852 --> 18:35.844
You think they get butler stories
like that every day?

18:38.491 --> 18:41.722
Who is Joseph Cotten? Giddyup.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.422
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me. It's Georgie boy.

18:44.597 --> 18:46.827
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.093
What's going on? I'll tell you
what's going on.

18:49.268 --> 18:51.031
I'm fired.

18:51.204 --> 18:52.432
Fired, why?

18:52.605 --> 18:54.038
Because you kissed me.

18:54.207 --> 18:56.402
You kissed me, you stupid idiot.

18:56.576 --> 18:59.511
Rita called Russell, and he fired me
over the phone.

19:00.179 --> 19:02.010
What is pi?

19:02.181 --> 19:04.547
Giddyup again. I'm killing, man.

19:04.984 --> 19:07.316
But I didn't... I had no idea...
I didn't realize.

19:07.487 --> 19:11.321
You didn't realize? How could you
not realize? You're stupid.

19:11.491 --> 19:14.289
You are a stupid, stupid man.

19:14.460 --> 19:16.394
I just feel terrible.
This is just terrible.

19:16.562 --> 19:18.928
What is the cha-cha?

19:19.098 --> 19:20.429
Yes, indeed.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.498
I'll speak to you later.

19:26.639 --> 19:29.199
This is great. He fired her!

19:29.375 --> 19:32.776
This is incredible. He fired her!
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

19:32.945 --> 19:35.846
- Why'd he fire her?
- Because I kissed her in the meeting!

19:36.015 --> 19:38.245
Russell found out. He fired her
over the phone!

19:38.418 --> 19:40.909
Finally, my stupidity pays off!

19:41.087 --> 19:44.579
What is "Here Come De Judge"?
"Here Come De Judge"!

19:45.591 --> 19:48.685
You can't break up with her.
Her life is shattered. You got her fired.

19:48.861 --> 19:50.328
You gotta be there for her.

19:50.496 --> 19:52.396
You gotta wait until
she gets another job.

19:52.565 --> 19:55.227
- Another job?
- A couple of interviews.

19:55.401 --> 19:58.131
Oh, this is unbelievable.

19:58.304 --> 20:00.363
I'm stuck.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.371
Every time I think I'm out...

20:02.542 --> 20:05.010
...they pull me back in.

20:12.552 --> 20:15.248
Are you going to want to leave
after it's over?

20:15.421 --> 20:17.013
You know, if we have sex.

20:17.757 --> 20:20.248
What, leave? Where, why?

20:20.660 --> 20:22.958
You know, the apartment.

20:23.262 --> 20:27.164
- Why would I? This is my apartment.
- Well, what if it was my apartment?

20:27.333 --> 20:29.198
Who gave you this idea
I would wanna leave?

20:29.769 --> 20:32.897
Well, Elaine said men like to leave
after it's over.

20:33.072 --> 20:35.506
I wouldn't put stock in
anything Elaine has to say...

20:35.675 --> 20:38.109
...about relationships.
She comes from a broken home.

20:38.277 --> 20:41.769
And I mean that literally. A tree fell
on the roof and cracked the structure.

20:41.948 --> 20:45.281
Her parents got along beautifully,
but the house was in bad shape.

20:46.319 --> 20:47.946
Maybe I should be going.

20:50.823 --> 20:52.757
- And what else did you say to her?
- Nothing.

20:52.925 --> 20:55.120
I was just giving her
the straight dope.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.591
More like a dope was giving it
to her straight.

20:58.765 --> 21:01.632
Another cup of coffee with you,
she'll wind up in a convent.

21:02.068 --> 21:04.832
Listen, there was a lot more
I could've told her, believe me.

21:05.004 --> 21:07.336
What about leaving after sex?
Did I leave with you?

21:07.540 --> 21:09.633
You might have, if I had stayed.

21:10.977 --> 21:13.241
So you know what,
I got served with papers today.

21:13.412 --> 21:15.505
Ping is suing me.

21:15.681 --> 21:17.672
I need your virgin as a witness,
so be nice.

21:17.884 --> 21:19.181
I was trying to be.

21:19.752 --> 21:21.686
Look at George.
He lucked out, huh?

21:22.288 --> 21:25.416
You're not kidding. Who figured
Susan would break up with him?

21:25.591 --> 21:27.149
- They had a good thing going.
- Yeah.

21:27.326 --> 21:29.260
Since she met him,
she's been vomited on...

21:29.428 --> 21:31.362
...her family cabin's been
burned down...

21:31.531 --> 21:35.365
...learned her father's a homosexual
and got fired from a high-paying job.

21:36.202 --> 21:39.603
Yeah, they had
a real good thing going.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.902
What do I do?

21:42.942 --> 21:45.342
Well, actually, I'm a writer.

21:45.511 --> 21:50.141
In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot
for NBC right now.

21:50.883 --> 21:52.783
A sitcom?

21:52.952 --> 21:56.388
How can you write that crap?

21:56.556 --> 21:59.787
Carol. This guy's writing a sitcom.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.927
A sitcom?

22:07.166 --> 22:08.565
A sitcom.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.258
Can you imagine?

22:10.436 --> 22:13.872
And he actually tried to use it
to hit on me.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.976
In ancient tribal cultures,
they would actually sacrifice a virgin.

22:18.144 --> 22:21.739
I mean, they would find some girl
that had never been with anybody...

22:21.914 --> 22:25.680
...and throw her into a volcano.
There's a first date you'll never forget.

22:26.118 --> 22:29.645
She winds up in heaven,
talking with Chuck Woolery, so...

22:29.956 --> 22:34.586
"Tell me, Lisa, how did the date end?"
"Not well, Chuck. Not well."

22:34.760 --> 22:38.890
"Well, if you'd like to be thrown into
a volcano again, we'll pay for it."

22:39.305 --> 22:45.218
