WEBVTT

00:02.431 --> 00:04.020
Phoenix. Where are you, girl?

00:04.021 --> 00:05.720
Oh, there you are.

00:05.721 --> 00:09.560
My trusty, rusty, kind of crusty
puppy dog old pal.

00:09.561 --> 00:11.980
We're loading up to head to
the farmer's market for the day.

00:11.981 --> 00:13.850
So we're leaving you
in charge to protect our home,

00:13.851 --> 00:15.390
because you're such a good girl.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.390
Yes, you are.
Who's a good girl?

00:17.391 --> 00:18.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18.771 --> 00:19.981
[babbling]

00:21.311 --> 00:22.680
Yes, he's a good boy.

00:22.681 --> 00:24.310
He's a very good boy.

00:24.311 --> 00:26.100
I will protect
the good boy's house.

00:26.101 --> 00:27.810
Oh, that's the spot.

00:27.811 --> 00:28.850
[Bill]
Blah-blah!

00:28.851 --> 00:30.140
Blah, blah, blah, blah?

00:30.141 --> 00:31.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31.561 --> 00:33.350
Mm... blah.

00:33.351 --> 00:35.020
Blah, blah, blah.

00:35.021 --> 00:36.770
Ride on, kind humans.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.930
Your kingdom is in good hands.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.140
Wait, the humans are gone?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.430
The humans are gone?

00:41.431 --> 00:42.770
[all]
The humans are gone!

00:42.771 --> 00:44.020
- [cow] Oh, no.
- What?

00:44.021 --> 00:45.640
[panicked chatter]

00:45.641 --> 00:47.100
Everyone, calm down.

00:47.101 --> 00:50.720
The humans will return.
This has happened before.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.680
I don't remember that.

00:52.681 --> 00:54.850
That's because you just hatched
yesterday.

00:54.851 --> 00:56.600
That's true.

00:56.601 --> 00:58.810
Loyal subjects, as your queen,
I will make sure

00:58.811 --> 01:01.220
you all remain safe and sound.

01:01.221 --> 01:03.680
With help from my trusted
advisor, Dirtbag.

01:03.681 --> 01:05.140
Present.

01:05.141 --> 01:06.930
I promise we can
make it through this.

01:06.931 --> 01:08.220
[all]
Oh, yeah!

01:08.221 --> 01:09.850
Thank you, Queen Phoenix.

01:09.851 --> 01:12.390
Oh! All hail Queen Phoenix.

01:12.391 --> 01:13.930
Ha! They're all
a bunch of sheep.

01:13.931 --> 01:15.770
Especially the sheep.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.430
Always following that old dog.

01:17.431 --> 01:20.430
It's the same thing
day after day after day.

01:20.431 --> 01:23.061
Oh, what I'd give
for a change of pace.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.980
Well, cock-a-doodle-doo.

01:27.981 --> 01:30.180
Ah, order is restored.

01:30.181 --> 01:31.980
Yeah, and because of that,

01:31.981 --> 01:34.390
I'm going to punch out and take
the rest of the day off.

01:34.391 --> 01:36.480
- [grunts]
- Dirtbag, you are always trying

01:36.481 --> 01:38.390
to wiggle out of your
responsibilities.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.810
Can I count on you
while the humans are away?

01:40.811 --> 01:43.930
Strange things can happen
in their absence.

01:43.931 --> 01:45.560
[Dirtbag hacking]

01:45.561 --> 01:47.850
Wow, look at the size
of that thing.

01:47.851 --> 01:50.020
I'm sorry,
were you saying something?

01:50.021 --> 01:52.520
[Cogburn]
Attention, fellow farm animals!

01:52.521 --> 01:54.890
Opportunity knocks if you are...

01:54.891 --> 01:56.480
[clucking]

01:56.481 --> 01:58.890
...bold enough to seize it.

01:58.891 --> 02:00.810
Cogburn, what are you
talking about?

02:00.811 --> 02:02.931
See for yourself.

02:04.271 --> 02:05.850
- The door?
- [all] The door?

02:05.851 --> 02:07.850
Yes. The dumb little boy
left it open.

02:07.851 --> 02:10.680
And what are we going to do
with the open door?

02:10.681 --> 02:12.140
Shut it.

02:12.141 --> 02:13.720
No, you idiot.

02:13.721 --> 02:15.060
We go inside it.

02:15.061 --> 02:16.680
[all]
Oh.

02:16.681 --> 02:18.640
No. I forbid it.

02:18.641 --> 02:21.060
The humans insist
we stay outside.

02:21.061 --> 02:24.930
Easy for you to say. You get
to go inside whenever you want.

02:24.931 --> 02:26.720
[disapproving chatter]

02:26.721 --> 02:28.890
These are the rules
that the humans have made,

02:28.891 --> 02:31.270
because they know
what's best for us.

02:31.271 --> 02:33.020
[approving chatter]

02:33.021 --> 02:35.810
Or maybe they're keeping us
from the good stuff.

02:35.811 --> 02:37.810
Inside the house
there's table scraps,

02:37.811 --> 02:39.640
cozy pillows, and...

02:39.641 --> 02:40.930
[groans]

02:40.931 --> 02:42.140
...pie.

02:42.141 --> 02:44.100
I mean, inside the house

02:44.101 --> 02:47.020
there are comforts
beyond your wildest dreams.

02:47.021 --> 02:48.480
[disapproving chatter]

02:48.481 --> 02:50.930
Admit it, you've been
holding out on us,

02:50.931 --> 02:53.220
oh, fair ruler.

02:53.221 --> 02:56.020
Or should I say,
old and weak ruler.

02:56.021 --> 02:58.180
[all]
Oh!

02:58.181 --> 03:00.350
Maybe it's time
for a new kind of queen.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.100
Maybe it's time...

03:02.101 --> 03:03.980
for a king.

03:03.981 --> 03:06.020
But who's going to be king?

03:06.021 --> 03:07.771
Me. I'm going to be king.

03:08.931 --> 03:10.020
Setting up my stand.

03:10.021 --> 03:11.641
Doo, doo, doo, doo-- Whoops.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.560
Gotcha. Hey, thanks stranger.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.640
I like a man who knows
the value of a good 'mater.

03:16.641 --> 03:17.930
What's your name, friend?

03:17.931 --> 03:20.390
My name?
Well, my name is Bill Green.

03:20.391 --> 03:21.721
Pleased to meet you.

03:22.931 --> 03:24.220
Bill Green?

03:24.221 --> 03:26.180
But that's my name.

03:26.181 --> 03:28.600
Wow, isn't that weird, Dad?

03:28.601 --> 03:30.980
Dad? Earth to Dad!

03:30.981 --> 03:32.180
I mean, uh...

03:32.181 --> 03:35.270
Hi, my name's also Bill Green.

03:35.271 --> 03:37.020
Well, what are the odds?

03:37.021 --> 03:40.350
So, what do you do for a living,
Bill?

03:40.351 --> 03:41.641
Oh, I'm a farmer.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.180
How very nice.

03:44.181 --> 03:45.980
Isn't that nice, son?

03:45.981 --> 03:47.430
Dad, you're hurting me.

03:47.431 --> 03:49.810
I'm across the aisle
if you want to come say hi.

03:49.811 --> 03:51.560
Well, I'd better get back to it.

03:51.561 --> 03:53.810
Goodbye, other Bill Green.

03:53.811 --> 03:56.520
Other Bill Green?

03:56.521 --> 03:59.100
Cogburn, I do not wish
to fight you.

03:59.101 --> 04:00.640
That's where you and I differ.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.021
[both yell]

04:05.641 --> 04:06.931
I've got him!

04:08.061 --> 04:10.020
[all laugh]

04:10.021 --> 04:11.720
You call this a ruler?

04:11.721 --> 04:13.641
[grunts]

04:15.681 --> 04:19.270
Yeah! All hail King Cogburn!

04:19.271 --> 04:22.220
[all]
All hail King Cogburn.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.980
As my first decree,

04:23.981 --> 04:26.810
I say we go inside the house.

04:26.811 --> 04:28.600
[excited chatter]

04:28.601 --> 04:30.270
Not on my watch.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.811
[grunting]
One sec. Just--

04:33.311 --> 04:34.640
Give me a minute.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.930
Hey, there.
I'm Bill Green

04:36.931 --> 04:38.850
of Green Family Farms.

04:38.851 --> 04:40.520
I'm the original one.
That's me.

04:40.521 --> 04:42.390
Wait. No, ma'am.
come back.

04:42.391 --> 04:43.930
Just wanted to clarify.

04:43.931 --> 04:45.480
Papa, what's wrong?

04:45.481 --> 04:48.600
Dad met another Bill Green
and it's freaking him out.

04:48.601 --> 04:50.430
It just feels weird.
If--

04:50.431 --> 04:52.930
If there's two Bill Greens,
then what makes me special?

04:52.931 --> 04:54.810
Who told you you were special?

04:54.811 --> 04:56.350
Not me, that's for sure.

04:56.351 --> 04:58.770
Dad, it's not a big deal.
Names are just names.

04:58.771 --> 05:00.560
It's not like
you're the same person.

05:00.561 --> 05:03.140
Why don't we go see what makes
the other Bill different?

05:03.141 --> 05:04.930
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

05:04.931 --> 05:06.930
Ma, watch the stand, please.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.561
Hm. Nah.

05:09.891 --> 05:11.350
[Cogburn]
My loyal subjects,

05:11.351 --> 05:13.930
it is time to claim
what is rightfully ours.

05:13.931 --> 05:16.100
- [chickens] Rightfully ours!
- [excited chatter]

05:16.101 --> 05:19.890
My subjects,
you must cease this madness.

05:19.891 --> 05:22.310
Oh, wow, nice and cozy.

05:22.311 --> 05:24.140
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:24.141 --> 05:25.930
[all]
Ooh.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.310
[all chattering]

05:27.311 --> 05:28.601
Looking good, looking good.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.020
You are destroying
the humans' home.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.980
This is bad animal behavior.

05:35.981 --> 05:37.930
[belches]
Yeah, maybe.

05:37.931 --> 05:39.140
But I like it here.

05:39.141 --> 05:41.430
Me too. It's different.

05:41.431 --> 05:44.350
Yeah, it's fun. Why did you
think we would not like this?

05:44.351 --> 05:45.890
[all, squawking]
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

05:45.891 --> 05:48.020
No! Wait. I...

05:48.021 --> 05:50.890
Yes! Your time is over, doggy.

05:50.891 --> 05:52.810
[all, chanting]
King! King! King! King!

05:52.811 --> 05:54.180
I deserve to rule.

05:54.181 --> 05:55.560
Let us away.

05:55.561 --> 05:57.600
What are we going to do,
King Cogburn?

05:57.601 --> 05:59.180
To the kitchen, royal subjects.

05:59.181 --> 06:00.600
We're going to bake us a pie.

06:00.601 --> 06:01.890
[cackles]

06:01.891 --> 06:03.770
[all]
King! King! King!

06:03.771 --> 06:05.270
No! Wait, I...

06:05.271 --> 06:06.810
Hey. Silver lining.

06:06.811 --> 06:09.930
I get my day off after all.

06:09.931 --> 06:12.020
Am I right? Hm.

06:12.021 --> 06:14.430
[Bill]
Oh, come on.

06:14.431 --> 06:15.811
[all]
Wow.

06:18.681 --> 06:21.060
[robot]
Would you like to try a zunana?

06:21.061 --> 06:23.100
A zucchini and a banana?

06:23.101 --> 06:25.430
Would you like to try
an apricorn?

06:25.431 --> 06:27.060
A corn-apricot hybrid?

06:27.061 --> 06:28.810
Who would do such a thing
to a vegetable?

06:28.811 --> 06:30.350
What was that, friend?

06:30.351 --> 06:31.850
I'm just wondering

06:31.851 --> 06:33.640
how a first-time
farmer's market seller

06:33.641 --> 06:35.020
has such a sleek setup?

06:35.021 --> 06:37.220
Well, I worked for years
in biotech,

06:37.221 --> 06:38.560
made a ton of money.

06:38.561 --> 06:40.060
I mean a ton.

06:40.061 --> 06:41.390
Uh-huh?

06:41.391 --> 06:43.220
But one day I realized

06:43.221 --> 06:45.770
my true passion was farming.

06:45.771 --> 06:47.480
So I started my own
high-tech farm

06:47.481 --> 06:49.930
using only cutting-edge
new techniques.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.890
Wow, Dad, this guy's
a financial success.

06:52.891 --> 06:53.811
See? You're nothing
like him.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.141
Dang it!

06:56.981 --> 06:58.310
[fly buzzing]

06:58.311 --> 07:00.890
You've made your king very
happy.

07:00.891 --> 07:01.980
[chomping]

07:01.981 --> 07:04.310
Well, now that you got your pie,

07:04.311 --> 07:06.560
we're all going to go
back outside.

07:06.561 --> 07:07.720
[clucks]

07:07.721 --> 07:10.310
Back outside?

07:10.311 --> 07:13.480
Well, yeah. This place isn't
really made for us, for one.

07:13.481 --> 07:14.850
[chomps]

07:14.851 --> 07:16.890
The grass in here
tastes terrible.

07:16.891 --> 07:18.850
Yeah, I want fresh air
and sunshine.

07:18.851 --> 07:20.640
We miss the coop.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.850
And that strange loud box.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.890
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

07:24.891 --> 07:27.770
Oh, I hate it so much.

07:27.771 --> 07:32.680
You fools. You're too idiotic to
realize that this is paradise.

07:32.681 --> 07:34.850
We have everything
we could possibly want here.

07:34.851 --> 07:37.980
More pie than you could eat
in a whole lifetime.

07:37.981 --> 07:40.350
But I don't care about pie.

07:40.351 --> 07:41.680
[all]
Me neither.

07:41.681 --> 07:42.810
[cow]
We just want to go back

07:42.811 --> 07:44.890
to where it's comfortable.

07:44.891 --> 07:46.890
You're not going anywhere.

07:46.891 --> 07:49.140
You're all going to stay in here

07:49.141 --> 07:51.680
and make me pie after pie

07:51.681 --> 07:53.810
until I decide I've had enough.

07:53.811 --> 07:54.930
Day after day,

07:54.931 --> 07:57.180
until I decide that I'm full.

07:57.181 --> 07:58.850
Do you hear me?

07:58.851 --> 08:00.930
[all]
Yes, Cogburn.

08:00.931 --> 08:04.180
Good. Now, get to baking.

08:04.181 --> 08:05.890
[chicken]
Almost there.

08:05.891 --> 08:08.640
Baking pie is hard,
and I do not like it.

08:08.641 --> 08:10.810
I'm so sick of making pie.

08:10.811 --> 08:12.140
[grunts]

08:12.141 --> 08:13.980
[sobs]

08:13.981 --> 08:16.430
Mm-mm. Smells like
freedom in here.

08:16.431 --> 08:17.890
Or maybe that's cherries.

08:17.891 --> 08:20.060
Dirtbag, please,
you got to help us.

08:20.061 --> 08:21.890
We hate Cogburn.

08:21.891 --> 08:24.350
- Hate him.
- Cogburn is very mean.

08:24.351 --> 08:25.810
Cogburn, mean?

08:25.811 --> 08:27.890
I almost can't handle the shock.

08:27.891 --> 08:29.350
Should I go tell Queen Phoenix?

08:29.351 --> 08:30.980
[overlapped chatter]

08:30.981 --> 08:32.980
Okay. Oh, wait.

08:32.981 --> 08:35.310
Queen Phoenix
isn't the queen anymore.

08:35.311 --> 08:37.810
I kind of remember
a bunch of folks

08:37.811 --> 08:39.220
stripping her of her collar.

08:39.221 --> 08:40.720
Who did that?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.810
- We did that.
- [all] Yeah.

08:42.811 --> 08:44.310
Oh.

08:44.311 --> 08:47.430
Anyhoo, at least your new life
is as easy as pie.

08:47.431 --> 08:48.720
[laughs]

08:48.721 --> 08:49.980
I crack myself up.

08:49.981 --> 08:52.930
Dirtbag, if you happen
to see Phoenix,

08:52.931 --> 08:54.430
tell her we're sorry.

08:54.431 --> 08:56.640
I'll try to remember that.

08:56.641 --> 08:57.810
Look at Other Bill over there.

08:57.811 --> 09:00.560
He thinks he's the greatest
thing since sliced bread.

09:00.561 --> 09:03.850
Well, guess what?
Not everybody likes bread.

09:03.851 --> 09:05.060
Dad, that's ridiculous.

09:05.061 --> 09:06.850
Everybody likes bread, Papa.

09:06.851 --> 09:09.560
So, what if there's
another farmer named Bill Green?

09:09.561 --> 09:11.890
It's just that the other
Bill Green is younger,

09:11.891 --> 09:13.220
more handsome, richer.

09:13.221 --> 09:15.270
Probably got all his fingers,
too.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.020
There's only one thing to do.

09:17.021 --> 09:20.390
I must challenge him
for the name of Bill Green.

09:20.391 --> 09:22.600
Uh, really?

09:22.601 --> 09:23.890
[sighs]

09:23.891 --> 09:25.600
[Phoenix]
Dirtbag, perhaps...

09:25.601 --> 09:27.720
[sighs]
...perhaps I was wrong.

09:27.721 --> 09:29.890
Ah, come on, now.
Don't talk like that.

09:29.891 --> 09:31.850
I don't deserve to be queen.

09:31.851 --> 09:34.020
Well, what if I told you

09:34.021 --> 09:36.520
the animals were already
starting to regret their choice?

09:36.521 --> 09:39.600
[Cogburn]
Bow down to the lord of pies!

09:39.601 --> 09:42.350
And what if I told you I made
them all feel guilty about it?

09:42.351 --> 09:44.850
Now they realize
how wrong they were.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.890
You... did that for me?

09:47.891 --> 09:50.850
Ah, well, I decided I don't need
a day off after all.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.310
Now, who's going
to get that rooster?

09:53.311 --> 09:55.640
Me. I'm going to get him.

09:55.641 --> 09:57.810
- Who's going to get him?
- I'm going to get him!

09:57.811 --> 09:58.850
I'm going to get him!

09:58.851 --> 10:00.520
Whoa, there she is.

10:00.521 --> 10:01.850
[barking and growling]

10:01.851 --> 10:04.521
Okay, okay, you're kind of
freaking me out.

10:05.721 --> 10:07.100
Listen up, Other Bill Green.

10:07.101 --> 10:08.890
Big City ain't big enough
for both--

10:08.891 --> 10:11.310
There you are, Bill.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.720
because I've been thinking
about something all day,

10:13.721 --> 10:16.850
and I just need to tell you
how inspired I am by you.

10:16.851 --> 10:18.810
Inspired? By me?

10:18.811 --> 10:20.810
I don't understand.

10:20.811 --> 10:22.640
Yeah. You're doing
what you love,

10:22.641 --> 10:24.930
and you're surrounded
by a beautiful family.

10:24.931 --> 10:26.480
Beautiful?

10:26.481 --> 10:27.930
I spent years at a job

10:27.931 --> 10:29.850
that left me little time
for anything else,

10:29.851 --> 10:32.020
and, well, I guess
I'm embarrassed to say,

10:32.021 --> 10:33.931
you got it all, Bill Green.

10:37.891 --> 10:39.060
Hey, are you that Bill Green

10:39.061 --> 10:40.810
with all the super-cool
super fruits?

10:40.811 --> 10:43.890
No, I'm the other Bill Green.

10:43.891 --> 10:46.520
Oh, cool, I'll just take
my money over there then.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.850
Bring me...

10:47.851 --> 10:48.890
Oh, let me think.
I know!

10:48.891 --> 10:50.430
More pie.

10:50.431 --> 10:52.390
I think you've had enough.

10:52.391 --> 10:55.480
- [all] She's back!
- Back for more, eh?

10:55.481 --> 10:59.720
As long as my tail still wags,
I will fight for my subjects.

10:59.721 --> 11:02.060
And I'll be by her side.

11:02.061 --> 11:05.390
Well, I suppose the reason you
can't teach old dogs new tricks

11:05.391 --> 11:06.980
is because they're dumb!

11:06.981 --> 11:08.640
[Cogburn yells]

11:08.641 --> 11:09.930
[gasps]
What-what?

11:09.931 --> 11:12.520
This is for our just
and wise ruler,

11:12.521 --> 11:14.430
Queen Phoenix.

11:14.431 --> 11:16.221
[blows landing]

11:17.561 --> 11:19.680
No. No.
No, no, no, no--

11:19.681 --> 11:22.890
[all]
Yay! All hail Queen Phoenix!

11:22.891 --> 11:25.100
Thank you, everyone.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.560
I promise to always have
your best interests at heart.

11:28.561 --> 11:31.020
Now let's go outside.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.980
[all chatter]

11:32.981 --> 11:34.930
The door.
It's closed.

11:34.931 --> 11:36.390
How do we open it?

11:36.391 --> 11:39.181
I have an idea
that just might work.

11:40.561 --> 11:42.930
[barks]

11:42.931 --> 11:45.390
[all, gasping]
She did it!

11:45.391 --> 11:47.100
Phoenix, I'm home.

11:47.101 --> 11:48.390
- [cow lows]
- Huh? Whoa!

11:48.391 --> 11:50.020
[sheep bleat]

11:50.021 --> 11:51.770
Phoenix! Who's a good girl?

11:51.771 --> 11:53.020
She's my good girl.

11:53.021 --> 11:54.850
[Bill]
Oh, my gosh!

11:54.851 --> 11:56.180
