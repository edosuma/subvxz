<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:02.937 --> 00:04.203
[tom]:<i> I've had</i>
<i>enough trouble around here.</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:05.804
<i>Starting over</i>
<i>sounds okay to me.</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:07.873
You told me
your wife died.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.941
I said that i'd lost her,
and it wasn't a lie.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.442
It was a deception.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.310
You certainly know how
to sweep a girl off her feet.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.113
I am trying my best.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.148
We can't just pick up
as if nothing's happened.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.150
Why not?
The past is in the past.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.486
I'm really glad
i met you, faith.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.720
You know
how i adore you,

00:21.722 --> 00:24.089
But i can't let this
continue any longer.

[♪♪♪]

00:40.908 --> 00:42.841
[♪♪♪]

00:45.746 --> 00:47.312
Jack!

00:47.314 --> 00:48.947
Morning, rosemary.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.682
Mr. Trevoy couldn't get
away from the saloon,

00:50.684 --> 00:52.151
So he asked me
to show you these.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.620
He said he got
this $5 bill last night

00:54.622 --> 00:55.687
From a gentleman

00:55.689 --> 00:57.022
Who bought drinks
for everyone,

00:57.024 --> 00:58.657
And then, just now,

00:58.659 --> 01:01.660
He got another $5 bill
from the same man!

01:01.662 --> 01:03.162
So what's the problem?

01:03.164 --> 01:06.231
Look, they have
the same serial number.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.637
Do you think
they could be counterfeit?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.972
Did you happen to see
what this man looked like?

01:13.974 --> 01:17.443
He's over there...
Waiting on the stage.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.046
Do you mind?

01:21.048 --> 01:22.714
-Oh!
-Thank you.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.519
Good morning,
rosemary.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.955
Oh! Elizabeth!
Welcome back.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.123
Thank you!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.658
I hear you took over
for mrs. Blakeley

01:32.660 --> 01:33.559
In the schoolhouse
while i was away.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.461
No need to thank me.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.296
The children and i
got along famously.

01:37.298 --> 01:40.132
Good, but,
for some reason,

01:40.134 --> 01:41.867
They didn't do
any of their lessons.

01:41.869 --> 01:42.968
Elizabeth...

01:42.970 --> 01:44.636
There's so much more
to learning

01:44.638 --> 01:46.305
Than what can be
found in books.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.408
You have to educate
the whole child.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.976
Encourage
independent thinking!

01:50.978 --> 01:53.912
Mm. You always
have such a...

01:53.914 --> 01:56.081
Unique perspective.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.350
Excuse me, sir.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.919
I wonder if you could tell me
where you got these $5 bills.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.692
Well, i cashed a check
at your bank yesterday.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.160
You did?

02:08.162 --> 02:09.728
You have
any more of them?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.631
Let me see.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.169
-[gunfire echoes]
-jack!

02:28.582 --> 02:31.016
[♪♪♪]

02:37.725 --> 02:40.192
[♪♪♪]

03:02.283 --> 03:04.149
Oh... Pastor.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.553
I hope you're not too full
to finish your breakfast?

03:07.555 --> 03:09.321
Oh, no, i'm just
taking my time.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.223
Would you like me to reheat it?

03:11.225 --> 03:13.926
No. No. Don't bother.
It's fine.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.994
Are you sure?
You usually devour the eggs.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.763
Are they too runny?

03:17.765 --> 03:18.830
Nah.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.966
Just a little crunchy.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.434
Oh, dear.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.504
Yeah, i usually like
my shells over-easy.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.105
Let me make you a fresh plate.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.975
[chuckles]:
No. No, it's okay.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.643
[sighs] i'm sorry.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.278
I'm just not myself today.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.280
Something you'd like
to talk about?

03:35.282 --> 03:38.183
Oh, no. I don't want to
bore you with my problems.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.619
Well, i think that's
part of my job description.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.021
[sighs resignedly]

03:43.023 --> 03:44.990
It's henry gowen.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.527
He delivered this
to me last night.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.496
It's a "notice
of required repairs."

03:52.533 --> 03:54.132
"safety violation.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.102
Hazardous stove, peeling paint,
faulty wiring..."

03:57.104 --> 03:58.470
For starters.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.539
Even if i could afford
the repairs,

04:00.541 --> 04:02.808
I could never
meet that deadline.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.776
Hmm. And then
he would shut you down?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.778
And every day
my doors are closed,

04:06.780 --> 04:08.213
I lose money.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.816
I wouldn't be
in business for very long.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.151
Henry wants you to sell,

04:13.153 --> 04:14.853
And he's using this
to force your hand.

04:14.855 --> 04:18.357
And elizabeth has volunteered
to help me after school,

04:18.359 --> 04:21.193
But the two of us can't
complete the job on time.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.697
I'm a pretty handy guy.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.965
If i start now,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.967
I think we can
make this deadline.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.702
I-i c-couldn't ask you
to do that.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.037
You're not asking.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.672
I'm offering.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.574
[sighs and chuckles]

04:39.980 --> 04:41.546
[bill huffs]:
A new assignment?

04:41.548 --> 04:43.815
I'm still working on
the counterfeiting case.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.684
Not anymore.
We've just gotten word

04:45.686 --> 04:47.352
That constable thornton
has arrested a third suspect

04:47.354 --> 04:48.420
In hope valley.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.155
The case is closed.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.324
Let me go back there
and interrogate the prisoner.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.592
That won't be necessary.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.860
The suspect is going
to be transferred

04:54.862 --> 04:56.328
To stand trial
with his partners.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.396
If i can talk to him first,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.664
I may be
able to find out

04:58.666 --> 05:00.532
Where they've hidden
the rest of the money.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.768
We can stop the phony bills
from being circulated.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.935
I said the case is closed.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.607
Yes, sir.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.443
One more thing.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.844
This report says

05:12.846 --> 05:14.513
That two of the counterfeit
plates you seized

05:14.515 --> 05:16.181
Are missing
from the evidence room.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.883
Know anything about that?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.319
No, sir. Probably just
a mistake in paperwork.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.360
Bill!

05:28.362 --> 05:30.128
Nora?

05:31.265 --> 05:32.864
You shouldn't be here.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.199
I had
a wonderful idea,

05:34.201 --> 05:35.467
And i couldn't wait
to tell you.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.402
I think
you'll want to hear it.

05:37.404 --> 05:38.737
This isn't a good time.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.805
You've been
working so hard

05:39.807 --> 05:41.473
With barely
a day's rest,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
So i thought we could
take a few days

05:43.377 --> 05:45.744
And go back
to cannon bay.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.312
I know how much
you love the beaches there.

05:47.314 --> 05:50.148
I can't talk
about this right now.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.628
Jack. I saw what
happened earlier.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.897
Are you all right?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.399
I'm fine.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.168
Who was that man
with the gun?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.636
Counterfeiter.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.972
And he wasn't too happy
about getting caught.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.075
I could see that.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.679
You said you had
a lot to think about

06:20.681 --> 06:22.280
On the train ride
back from hamilton,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.449
But we've barely spoken
since we got back.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.085
That's because there
isn't much to discuss.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.421
It was a very
long train ride.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.456
There must be
lots to discuss.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.291
You made yourself
perfectly clear

06:33.293 --> 06:34.993
At the train station
in hamilton.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.629
Clear about what?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.197
That we are
two different people

06:39.199 --> 06:40.866
From two
different worlds,

06:40.868 --> 06:42.834
And i don't belong
in your world.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.935
Let's just
leave it at that.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.337
I don't want to
leave it at that.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.506
My world is here.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.040
I'm not so sure
you're being honest about that.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.876
Not being honest?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.978
Jack thornton,
you take that back.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.713
Jack. Elizabeth.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.214
It so good
to have you both back.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.183
Great to be home.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.018
So i assume i'll be seeing you
at the dance together?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.319
Dance?
I hadn't heard.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.254
Me neither.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.023
But i couldn't go
even if i wanted to.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.192
I have so much
to catch up on for school.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.794
I have a mountain of paperwork
i have to get through.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.629
In fact, i really should
get started right away.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.130
-Me, too.
-The sooner the better.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.965
Lovely to
see you, molly.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.000
[jack]:
A pleasure, miss sullivan.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.968
Good day, jack.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.177
Thought you could use
some more nails.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.878
Oh, no.
I'm almost finished, thanks.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.547
Would you like some lemonade?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.649
I would love some lemonade.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.653
Well, at this rate,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.988
We'll be finished soon.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.890
You'll be
finished with gowen

07:38.892 --> 07:42.394
And it'll be
business as usual.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.863
I don't know that i'll ever
be done with henry gowen.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.364
But i'll say a prayer.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.266
So will i.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.401
Can i ask you
a question?

07:49.403 --> 07:50.769
Well, of course.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.105
Why are you doing
all of this for me?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.440
Well, like i said,

07:55.442 --> 07:56.741
It's a part of
my job description.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.043
For some reason,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.177
I don't believe
you're quite so attentive

07:59.179 --> 08:00.445
To everyone
in hope valley.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.750
When i first came here,

08:05.752 --> 08:08.353
I found a town that had gone
through a lot of pain.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.224
And after a while,
when i got to know folks,

08:12.226 --> 08:14.092
I asked them how
they found the strength

08:14.094 --> 08:15.360
To get through it.

08:15.362 --> 08:18.063
How did they manage
to come together

08:18.065 --> 08:19.197
Instead of break apart?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.131
And you know what they told me?

08:20.133 --> 08:22.100
-Faith and family?
-No.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.135
Some of those people
lost their families.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.304
And a lot of those people
were losing faith.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.106
Then what was it?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.675
It was you, abigail.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.445
More often than not,

08:33.447 --> 08:35.213
Those people said
that it was you

08:35.215 --> 08:37.482
That held this town together.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.552
So...

08:40.554 --> 08:43.388
When you ask me why
i'm doing what i'm doing...

08:44.658 --> 08:46.091
Well, i just figured
it's about time

08:46.093 --> 08:47.726
Someone started
looking after you, too.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.964
[bill]: There's only one person
who can keep you

08:52.966 --> 08:55.333
From spending the rest
of your life in federal prison,

08:55.335 --> 08:57.168
And you're looking at him.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.137
You cooperate with me,

08:59.139 --> 09:00.906
I'll make it
worth your while.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.241
[door opens]

09:07.247 --> 09:08.914
Bill?

09:08.916 --> 09:11.116
Jack! Good to see you.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.284
I didn't know
you were back in town.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.086
Yeah, just wrapping up
the counterfeit case.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.988
Nice work on
bringing this guy in.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.757
Headquarters informed me
that case was closed.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.191
-Actually, it's been reopened.
-Really?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.526
No one told me.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.028
Just tying up
a few loose ends.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.429
Should only be a day or so,

09:24.431 --> 09:26.131
Then i'll be on my way
back to hamilton.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.366
Well, if there's
anything i can do...

09:28.368 --> 09:31.436
Thanks, jack.
I got it handled.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.481
[rosemary chuckles]:
Oh, ho, ho. Louise!

09:43.483 --> 09:45.951
Your husband
is not going to like this,

09:45.953 --> 09:48.954
But the truth must be spoken.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.324
"dear... Loyal... Reader...

09:52.326 --> 09:57.295
"any man who would forget
his own anniversary...

09:57.297 --> 09:59.397
"deserves nothing more

09:59.399 --> 10:01.800
"than an ice-cold shoulder.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.868
"or you might suggest

10:03.870 --> 10:06.838
"that he spend the night
on the floor...

10:06.840 --> 10:08.373
In the toolshed."

10:08.375 --> 10:10.875
And out of nowhere,

10:10.877 --> 10:12.744
He asked me
to the dance.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.912
I didn't know
what to say.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.213
[florence]:
Well, i hope you said yes!

10:15.215 --> 10:16.681
Of course.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.551
Well... Who is he?

10:19.553 --> 10:22.354
[molly]:
Lee. Coulter.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.855
[florence]:
You must be very excited.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.256
Am i ever.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.424
Can you believe it?

10:26.426 --> 10:30.161
He's so handsome
and charming.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
[huffs]

10:31.999 --> 10:35.567
"there is only
one word to describe

10:35.569 --> 10:39.771
A man who would treat a woman
with such disrespect."

10:41.708 --> 10:44.576
"and that one word,
dear reader,

10:44.578 --> 10:47.579
Is<i> scoundrel."</i>

10:51.551 --> 10:53.752
Elizabeth?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.620
Abigail ordered these
from the mercantile.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.855
I thought i'd drop 'em off.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.824
You can
put them here.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.096
[she resumes hammering]

11:16.610 --> 11:18.109
Nice job.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.144
Contrary to what
you may think,

11:19.146 --> 11:20.412
I am capable of a great deal

11:20.414 --> 11:22.113
Beyond
my drawing-room education.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.716
Never said you weren't.

11:26.620 --> 11:30.221
Why did you say that i wasn't
being honest about who i am?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.491
Elizabeth, i don't think
this is where your heart is.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.261
Why would you say that?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.096
How long did it
take you to come back here

11:38.098 --> 11:39.330
When your mother was sick?

11:39.332 --> 11:42.167
Jack, i couldn't just
pick up and leave.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.435
She needed me.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.836
I understand that.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.504
And that's why you stayed?

11:46.506 --> 11:48.039
Not because
of anything else?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.775
Are you talking
about charles?

11:50.777 --> 11:53.144
You and charles have
a lot in common.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.946
And i suppose you have a lot
in common with that nurse.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.481
Faith, is it?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.249
Faith?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.851
Faith didn't try to change me
into something that i'm not.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.252
In fact, the last
thing she said to me

12:01.254 --> 12:03.421
Before i came back
was to remember who i am.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.123
Jack, when have i ever
tried to change you?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.092
You wanted me to take the job
your father offered me.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.026
No, i didn't!

12:10.130 --> 12:11.963
All right, i thought you should
at least consider it

12:11.965 --> 12:13.531
And hear him out.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.966
There could actually be

12:14.968 --> 12:16.334
Some advantages
to working for him.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.535
That's the problem right there.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.137
I don't see any problem at all,

12:19.139 --> 12:20.772
Except for the fact that you're
not being very open-minded,

12:20.774 --> 12:21.840
And i don't understand why!

12:21.842 --> 12:22.774
Elizabeth.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.412
-I've got to get back to work.
-So do i.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.694
You know, i was thinking
it would be fun for all of us

12:42.696 --> 12:43.995
To go into
town today.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.630
No, thank you.
I'd rather be alone.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.500
Julie, we're just trying
our best to cheer you up.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.668
All we want
is for you to be happy.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.237
If you really wanted me
to be happy,

12:52.239 --> 12:53.371
You wouldn't
have sent tom away.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.340
We didn't
send him away.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.308
He took a job
in another city.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.043
Please! You don't think
i know what's going on?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.378
You chased him away

13:00.380 --> 13:01.746
Because he's not from
the right kind of family.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.581
That's not true.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.049
-Your father--
-[scoffs] it is true!

13:05.051 --> 13:06.317
It's the same thing
he tried to do with elizabeth.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.353
We're not talking about
elizabeth right now.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.255
You don't like
that she's involved with jack

13:10.257 --> 13:11.489
For the same reason,

13:11.491 --> 13:12.757
And you've made it very clear.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.826
She's just lucky
she lives so far away.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.860
Julie, your mother
doesn't deserve to

13:15.862 --> 13:17.162
Be spoken to like that.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.263
And i don't deserve
to be treated

13:18.265 --> 13:19.597
The way
that you've treated me.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.911
I hope you'll
come by for supper.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.112
It's the least
i can do.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.446
That's very kind of you,
but i've already

13:35.448 --> 13:37.215
Been invited to dinner
by the henshaws.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.784
Oh. Well, perhaps a rain check.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.120
Yeah. I would love that.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.621
So do you think
we can get started

13:43.623 --> 13:45.256
By 7:00 a.M. Tomorrow?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.592
We can start by
6:00 a.M., if you like.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.793
Even better!

13:48.795 --> 13:50.829
[abigail laughs]

14:04.811 --> 14:06.778
Hello, abigail.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.981
Bill.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.718
What brings you to hope valley?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.321
I'm in town finishing
an investigation.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.658
How's clara?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.227
She's fine.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.596
She's in cape fullerton
for a few days,

14:24.598 --> 14:25.964
Picking up supplies.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.566
Oh.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.903
I saw pastor hogan
leave just now.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.273
Yes. He's helping me
with some repairs.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.975
He's a good man.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.376
Yes. He is.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.247
It's...

14:43.984 --> 14:46.184
Difficult for me
to see you

14:46.186 --> 14:47.886
Spending time
with someone else.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.855
Frank hogan is a friend.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.593
If you don't mind,
i have a lot of work to do here.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.029
And i know you have
things to do as well.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.368
It's good to see you, abigail.

There's
our relationship expert,

15:23.290 --> 15:24.822
Hard at work.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.324
Oh, hello, lee.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.459
Hello. Any interesting
letters from your readers?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.328
Oh, well, it's amazing

15:30.330 --> 15:34.165
That so many people
have issues with romance.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.700
You wouldn't think it would be
that hard, would you?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.001
But it is.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.403
I'm starting to think

15:38.405 --> 15:41.306
That men and women
just don't think the same way.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.340
[takes a deep breath]

15:42.342 --> 15:44.008

the opposite sex.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.278

15:48.982 --> 15:50.548
I couldn't agree with you more.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.650
Speaking... Of problems.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.521
There is something
i wanted to talk to you about.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.556
Anything.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.725
You can feel free
to talk to me any time.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.961
Can i rely on you
to keep this confidential?

16:05.065 --> 16:06.564
Completely. Uh...

16:09.703 --> 16:11.035
I've been thinking a lot

16:11.037 --> 16:13.204
About a discussion
that we had a while ago.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.238
Yes.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.940
So have i, lee--

16:17.043 --> 16:18.042
Please.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.277
Go on.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.845
And you mentioned

16:20.847 --> 16:23.681
That you wanted to do
an expose on henry gowen?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.049
Sorry. What?

16:25.051 --> 16:26.951
But that your publisher
was afraid to do it.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.686
Yes.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.887
Anyway, i talked him into it.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.190
And he said that
if you did a good job,

16:32.192 --> 16:33.958
He would publish it
on the front page.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.027
-Front page?
-Yes!

16:37.797 --> 16:41.866
Oh. A-and that's what
you wanted to talk to me about?

16:41.868 --> 16:42.934
Well, yeah. Of course.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.603
Well, that's...

16:45.605 --> 16:47.672
Oh, just...

16:53.713 --> 16:55.780
What's the matter?
You don't...

16:55.782 --> 16:57.915
You don't seem
that excited.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.751
Is there something else
on your mind?

16:59.753 --> 17:01.719
I...

17:02.822 --> 17:04.055
No.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.656
-Ah.
-I am excited.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.658
I am-- i am thrilled.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.461
I just can't wait
to put that pen to paper.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.163
That's the spirit!

17:12.165 --> 17:13.865
I'm gonna go get a drink.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.008
[knocking]

17:24.010 --> 17:25.910
One moment!

17:29.315 --> 17:30.882
Hello, bill.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.622
How did you even find me?

17:37.624 --> 17:39.657
Why? Is it a secret?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.326
I'm not doing this!
I'm here on police business.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.928
It's no good lying to me.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.196
I spoke with your boss.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.931
You were supposed
to be working

17:46.933 --> 17:48.266
On a new case
in hamilton.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.034
You-- you had no right
to do that!

17:50.036 --> 17:51.769
Please, bill.
Don't turn this on me.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.438
We both know what
brought you back here.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.808
This has nothing
to do with abigail.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.376
I don't believe you.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.610
That's why i bought a ticket

17:59.612 --> 18:01.112
And took the very next train
out here.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.947
When i get back to hamilton,

18:02.949 --> 18:05.183
We will discuss all of this,
i promise you,

18:05.185 --> 18:07.051
But right now,
you can't be here.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.619

arrange a room for you

20:38.471 --> 20:39.637
Learn?

20:39.639 --> 20:41.138
That i'm not you!

20:41.140 --> 20:43.274
That i don't have the same taste
in clothes,

20:43.276 --> 20:44.775
I don't have
the same taste in friends,

20:44.777 --> 20:47.011
And i certainly do not have
the same taste in men.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.013
Julie, you really need
to put tom in the past.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.015
You think you know everything,
don't you?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.116
That just because
you found

20:52.118 --> 20:53.551
A man to marry you
that has a title,

20:53.553 --> 20:54.719
That you're better
than me?

20:54.721 --> 20:57.221
Are you even
in love with lionel?

20:57.223 --> 21:00.524
As a matter of fact, i am.

21:00.526 --> 21:03.194
Are you sure
it's for the right reasons?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.531
At least it's not
for the wrong reasons.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.966
What's that supposed to mean?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.368
Do you really think
you're in love with tom?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.303
Or is the reason
you're attracted to him

21:12.305 --> 21:13.504
Because you're trying to prove
something to mother and father?

21:13.506 --> 21:14.972
You wouldn't understand.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.374
All i'm suggesting is

21:16.376 --> 21:18.209
That you open yourself up
to other possibilities.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.311
Lionel's cousin wants to ask you
to the opera society ball.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.581
Would it be so terrible
to go with a man

21:23.583 --> 21:25.383
Who's handsome,
wealthy and well-bred?

21:25.385 --> 21:28.653
Haven't you been listening?
I am in love with someone else.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.657
All right.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.526
Then just come along
to enjoy the music.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.328
I've been told the baritone
is exceptional.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.365
Fine.

21:41.367 --> 21:44.068
But only because
it's better than staying home.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.772
Who knows?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.907
You might even enjoy yourself.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.744
[footsteps recede]

22:01.421 --> 22:03.421
I hear things
are a little frosty

22:03.423 --> 22:04.622
Between you and jack.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.924
Who told you that?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.192
It's a small town.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.263
We just can't seem to get over
what happened in hamilton,

22:12.265 --> 22:13.898
And i don't understand why.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.633
It's never easy when
you have an argument

22:15.635 --> 22:16.867
With someone
you care about.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.037
And i care about jack
a great deal.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.272
I know.

22:21.274 --> 22:23.040
I think you might

22:23.042 --> 22:24.642
Have to get to
the heart of the matter.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.078
It's not
what's on surface.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.547
It's about what's
going on underneath.

22:29.549 --> 22:33.217
And you might have to do
some digging to get to it.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.220
Jack says we're from
two different worlds.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.289
Okay. Not
very specific,

22:38.291 --> 22:39.623
But it's a start.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.125
[abigail chuckles]

22:41.127 --> 22:43.427
It was like pulling teeth
getting that much from him.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.763
Just keep
the conversation going.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.232
Not talking about it
is the worst thing you can do.

22:54.107 --> 22:57.074
[rosemary]:
It just doesn't make any sense.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.343
All i said was i wasn't ready
to be swept away,

22:59.345 --> 23:00.745
And then, all of a sudden,

23:00.747 --> 23:02.780
Lee is asking some other woman
to the dance.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.949
[hushed, darkly]:
Molly sullivan, no less.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.151
Molly is a kind, smart,
beautiful woman.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.020
She has nice feet.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.156
I also hear
she's a fantastic cook.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.092
Not half as good as i am.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.495
Her scones
are like lead.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.597
Her pot roast is as tough
as shoe leather.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.133
Don't even get me started
on her flapjacks.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.667
I don't think
i've ever seen you so worked up.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.035
I am not worked up!

23:25.037 --> 23:26.337
I am just...

23:26.339 --> 23:28.172
Trying...

23:31.110 --> 23:33.711
To save lee from
a lifetime of indigestion.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.883
And i know exactly what to do.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.718
What's that?

23:40.720 --> 23:43.654
I have the perfect gift
to win him over.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.158
A little...
Token of my feelings.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.126
Do you really think men
are that easily swayed?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.695
Says the man

23:51.697 --> 23:53.898
Whose relationship
has been on ice since hamilton?

23:53.900 --> 23:56.200
This is about you,
it's not about me.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.236
Come on, jack. I barely see you
and elizabeth together anymore.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.638
What happened this time?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.006
And tell me the truth.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.240
Is it charles?

24:04.477 --> 24:06.544
I'm not telling you
anything, rosie.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.813
I write an advice column
that is completely anonymous.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.381
Your secrets
are safe with me.

24:10.383 --> 24:11.515
I promise!

24:11.517 --> 24:12.683
Everyone that reads your column

24:12.685 --> 24:13.717
Knows exactly
who you're talking about.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.219
[laughs]

24:15.221 --> 24:18.556
I swear, i won't write
about anything you tell me.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.257
Not one word.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.226
I'm just concerned
about you.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.164
Would you
look at that!

24:27.166 --> 24:29.166
[♪♪♪]

24:32.505 --> 24:34.338
They certainly do make
a handsome couple.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.773
[quietly]:
Bite your tongue!

24:35.775 --> 24:37.675
[♪♪♪]

24:39.879 --> 24:42.413
Jack?

24:42.415 --> 24:44.281
[whimpering]

24:44.283 --> 24:47.284
Rip? What are you
doing under there?

24:49.555 --> 24:51.856
[loud thunder crashing]

24:51.858 --> 24:54.325
[rip whining]

24:55.895 --> 24:58.429
Don't worry, rip.
It's only thunder.

24:58.431 --> 25:00.264
[sighs]

25:02.201 --> 25:03.968
"dear jack..."

25:03.970 --> 25:05.469
[thunder crashing]

25:06.939 --> 25:10.241
"i know it's difficult

25:10.243 --> 25:13.110
"to talk

25:13.112 --> 25:15.012
About these things..."

25:19.285 --> 25:20.885
Mr. Jenkins says
this is as far

25:20.887 --> 25:23.287
As the bank is willing
to go with that loan.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.956
Well, at least
it'll buy me time

25:25.958 --> 25:27.958
To get back
on my feet.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.829
Is there
anything else?

25:31.831 --> 25:33.264
I heard a rumor

25:33.266 --> 25:34.465
Rosemary leveaux

25:34.467 --> 25:36.667
Is writing
an article about you.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.736
An expose about how...

25:38.738 --> 25:41.705
You abuse
your power as mayor.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.509
Get me that...

25:45.511 --> 25:46.577
Editor of that newspaper.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.945
Tell him i'd like
to have a word.

25:47.947 --> 25:48.946
Certainly.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.681
Henry?

25:50.683 --> 25:52.616
Nora!

25:52.618 --> 25:56.287
I... Didn't expect
that i would see you so soon.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.255
Oh, i hope
it's not an imposition.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.857
No. Not at all.
It's nice to see you.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.959
I wish bill felt the same way.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.628
He seems quite taken
with abigail stanton.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.665
I'm sorry to have
had to be the one to tell you.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.802
You must think i'm a fool
to work so hard to win him back.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.004
I think you should do
whatever makes you happy.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.774
He asked me to leave,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.175
But i don't think
it's a good idea

26:18.177 --> 26:20.578
For him to be here
without me, do you?

26:21.881 --> 26:24.415
Though i don't have
much money for the hotel.

26:25.651 --> 26:28.686
Let me help you
find a place to stay.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.954
Thank you, henry.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.555
You've always been
very kind to me.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.791
I always will be, nora.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.968
Rip! [whistles]

26:43.970 --> 26:45.869
Jack, i've been
looking for you.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.638
Have you seen rip?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.673
I saw him
in the jail earlier.

26:49.675 --> 26:50.741
You were
in the jail?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.343
Yes.

26:52.345 --> 26:55.079
Did you leave
the door open?

26:55.081 --> 26:57.081
No. I don't think so.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.751
Maybe i did?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.654
He hates thunder.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.556
He runs off if the door
isn't kept closed.

27:05.558 --> 27:06.890
Jack, i'm so sorry.
I'll find him for you.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.058
I promise.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.693
I'll bet he's at the mine.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.562
It's where i found him last time
he got spooked by the thunder.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.364
I'll go get him.
It was my fault.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.332
Storm's coming in.
I'll get him.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.037
Jack, i am perfectly capable of
riding off to the mine myself.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.205
Elizabeth--

27:21.207 --> 27:22.740
I'll be back
before you know it.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.442
Well, you're not going alone!

disturbing you.

27:47.299 --> 27:50.467
Oh, no! No. Not at all.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.770
Well, i saw you
sitting here...

27:52.772 --> 27:54.038
All alone.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.005
Yes.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.375
May i join you?

27:58.377 --> 28:01.445
Oh, yes! [laughs]
of course. Please.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.814
Please do.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.584
So. Uh...

28:07.586 --> 28:09.787
How is
the editorial coming?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.121
The what?

28:11.123 --> 28:12.589
The expose you're writing
on henry gowen.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.491
Yes.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.993
That editorial.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.461
Uh, it is coming.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.564
The words-- they are just
flowing onto the page.

28:20.566 --> 28:21.965
Great.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.768
But the sooner you get it done,
the better.

[tin scrapes table]

28:34.914 --> 28:36.580
-I made you something.
-What is it?

28:36.582 --> 28:38.615
Oh, it's just a small gift.
Nothing special.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.150
A gift?

28:40.152 --> 28:41.452
What for?

28:41.454 --> 28:43.020
-Oh, do i need a reason?
-Absolutely not.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.521
-Should i-- yeah?
-Yes, please.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.425
They're my oatmeal-raisin
cookies! [giggles]

28:48.427 --> 28:50.294
I know you have
a fondness for sweets.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.764
Thank you!
Um, you shouldn't have.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.033
I promise you,

28:56.035 --> 28:58.035
These will be gone
by the end of the day.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.603
Well, i know
they're delicious,

28:59.605 --> 29:01.038
But you shouldn't
eat them all at once.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.207
Oh, not me. I'm gonna take them
to the boys at the mill.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.875
Why would you do that?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.276
Because
i'm allergic to raisins.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.678
Oh, dear.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.681
[awkward chuckle]

Well, as you can imagine,

29:18.457 --> 29:20.324
I have had a few offers--
well, i mean,

29:20.326 --> 29:21.859
Many offers, in fact,

29:21.861 --> 29:24.795
So i am still deciding.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.730
I see.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.633
Are you going?

Yes.

Yes, i am.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.070
That's nice.

Well, he doesn't
seem to be here now.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.842

keep looking?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.711
It's coming down
buckets out there.

He's probably taken
shelter somewhere.

We should do the same.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.386
[elizabeth]: Looks like
someone's been here before.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.322
Prospectors sometimes
use these mines

30:58.324 --> 30:59.590
To set up camp,

30:59.592 --> 31:01.491
But they usually
clear off after summer.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.627
Well, there's no sense
freezing to death.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.972
What are you doing?

31:14.974 --> 31:16.673
I'm starting a fire.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.710
I read a book on camping,
and this is how it's done.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.547
You know, i have matches
in my saddle bag.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.851
[sighing]

31:27.853 --> 31:29.686
Why didn't you say so?

31:29.688 --> 31:31.822
It's more fun
watching you.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.093
Well, would you
please go and get them?

31:50.109 --> 31:52.643
Well, this is the most
pleasant interrogation

31:52.645 --> 31:54.111
I can remember.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.380
Well, i'm not done yet.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.682
I've got one more
question for you.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.817
Where's
the money hidden?

32:00.819 --> 32:02.219
What money?

32:02.221 --> 32:03.820
Well, your partners
said you're the one

32:03.822 --> 32:05.489
Who knew where
the money was.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.891
I figured that's what
you were going after.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.860
I don't know what
they're talking about.

32:09.862 --> 32:11.895
Well, it's like this.

32:11.897 --> 32:14.631
Given the amount of paper,
chemicals, and ink you bought,

32:14.633 --> 32:16.867
We figured your gang
had enough to print up

32:16.869 --> 32:18.669
About a thousand bills.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.370
We've confiscated
about half of those,

32:20.372 --> 32:23.407
Which means you've hidden
the other half somewhere.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.344
Well, even if i did
know where they were,

32:27.346 --> 32:29.413
Why would i tell you?

32:30.683 --> 32:33.083
Because you can't
spend that money

32:33.085 --> 32:35.419
Locked up in federal prison
the rest of your life.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.221
You have
a deal in mind?

32:40.693 --> 32:41.992
You tell me where it is,

32:41.994 --> 32:44.728
And i might be able
to get you out of here.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.830
And how do i know you're not
gonna shoot me in the back?

32:46.832 --> 32:49.066
Because i'm a mountie
and i keep my word.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.902
And if i kill a man,
i want to look him in the eyes.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.073
Well, i'm gonna need
something to tide me over.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.674
10% of the take.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.343
But i want the name of the man

32:59.345 --> 33:01.078
Who's running
the whole operation.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.081
No deal.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.284
That's your choice.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.251
[whiskey splashes]

33:09.855 --> 33:11.955
I'll give you a little time
to think it over.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.192
[♪♪♪]

33:26.972 --> 33:28.805
How are you?

33:29.875 --> 33:31.708
Hello.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.517
You're a very
popular man.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.421
I'm a preacher.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.623
It's my message
that's popular.

33:48.127 --> 33:51.828
I hear you've been
busy over at the cafe.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.698
A community is stronger
when we look out for each other.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.202
I do more for this town
than you'll ever know.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.873
Well, some people
see it differently.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.643
I think you've made
one too many social calls

34:06.645 --> 34:07.911
Over to that cafe.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.627
If something's
troubling you, henry,

34:23.629 --> 34:24.895
I'd surely like
to know about it.

34:26.265 --> 34:29.166
Well, i appreciate
your pious concern, pastor,

34:29.168 --> 34:32.102
But the only thing
that bothers me

34:32.104 --> 34:34.271
Is a preacher who isn't
minding his own business.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.347
It must've
been upsetting

34:44.349 --> 34:46.850
When the mine closed
and you lost your job.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.286
It was a difficult time.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.289
My situation has
improved greatly since then.

34:54.026 --> 34:56.993
It's a big responsibility...
Being mayor.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.463
Yeah, and no one
is more qualified to do it

34:59.465 --> 35:00.864
Than i am.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.666
But some might say

35:02.668 --> 35:05.902
That your interest
in personal gain

35:05.904 --> 35:08.505
Comes before the interest
of the community.

35:08.507 --> 35:12.309
Well, i think you should take
what abigail stanton says

35:12.311 --> 35:14.144
With a grain of salt.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.879
Mrs. Stanton
means you no harm.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.548
I don't mean you any harm...

35:18.550 --> 35:20.650
But i did look into you
once you came to hope valley.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.385
[chuckles dryly]

35:23.422 --> 35:25.155
I'm not surprised.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.558
It would seem
that before you graduated

35:28.560 --> 35:30.827
From the seminary
at fuller,

35:30.829 --> 35:33.663
Well...
You didn't exist.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.266
No one seems
to know who you are.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.768
Hope valley
is my first congregation.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.504
Yeah,
i know that.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.007
I also know that
you're hiding something.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.209
Whatever it is,

35:46.211 --> 35:48.044
Well...

35:48.046 --> 35:49.412
I'll find out.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.680
Eventually.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.986
[♪♪♪]

36:01.426 --> 36:03.760
That should keep us warm
for a couple hours.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.931
The storm might
pass by then.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.134
Mother nature rarely plays
by anyone else's rules.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.403
She can be
very headstrong.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.740
Like someone
else i know.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.176
You used to
like that about me.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.445
Still do.

36:22.447 --> 36:23.613
But you resent
who i am

36:23.615 --> 36:24.981
And where i'm from.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.383
I never said that.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.052
Then what did you
mean when you said

36:29.054 --> 36:31.388
We come from
two different worlds?

36:31.390 --> 36:32.756
You couldn't wait
to leave hamilton.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.324
I didn't want
to become someone i'm not

36:34.326 --> 36:35.725
Just to please your father.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.662
This isn't about
pleasing my father.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.966
Truth is...

36:42.968 --> 36:44.501
It feels like
you're a different person

36:44.503 --> 36:45.735
When you're in hamilton.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.875
I'm not sure
you know who you are yet.

36:53.145 --> 36:54.644
Now you sound
exactly like my father.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.415
Elizabeth,

36:58.417 --> 37:00.417
The woman that pumped
water on that homestead

37:00.419 --> 37:01.985
Is not the same person

37:01.987 --> 37:03.587
That has a servant set out
her clothes for her every day.

37:03.589 --> 37:06.623
Jack! Can't you see
it's all a part of me?

37:06.625 --> 37:09.125
I enjoyed being
on the homestead,

37:09.127 --> 37:11.428
And i enjoy living
in a big house in hamilton.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.570
You just won't accept me
for who i am.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.908
You've got that backwards.

37:26.111 --> 37:27.544
You really believe that?

37:29.281 --> 37:31.081
I'm gonna see if i can find
some more firewood.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.527
[♪♪♪]

37:45.831 --> 37:49.032
Julie? What are you
doing down here?

37:49.034 --> 37:51.301
I think
it's quite obvious.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.336
I'm playing the piano.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.604
Why aren't you dressed
for the opera?

37:56.041 --> 37:58.174
I'm not going.

37:58.176 --> 37:59.876
What do you mean,
you're not going?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.211
You accepted an invitation.

38:01.213 --> 38:03.813
I changed my mind.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.048
That's absurd.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.416
Go upstairs
and get ready.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.051
No.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.154
You're doing this
to embarrass me, aren't you?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.090
You might find this
hard to believe, viola,

38:14.092 --> 38:16.493
But this isn't about you,
it's about me.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.328
I'm not your servant
or your puppet.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.663
You can't just
order me around!

38:19.665 --> 38:20.997
What's gotten
into you lately?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.565
It's as if you're not
the same person anymore.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.634
Because i'm learning
to stand up for myself?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.904
Well, i'm sorry
if you don't like it,

38:27.906 --> 38:30.607
But this is who i am now,
so you better get used to it.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.941
You haven't been yourself

38:31.943 --> 38:33.043
Since you took up
with tom thornton.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.344
The moment
you laid eyes on him,

38:34.346 --> 38:35.712
I knew there was
going to be trouble.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.914
That's it. Blame it on tom.
Blame everything on tom!

38:37.916 --> 38:39.249
Julie, this has to stop.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.917
<i>Stop?</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:42.852
I am just getting started.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.489

38:50.228 --> 38:51.761
Thank you.

Oh, my word!

38:54.633 --> 38:56.499
It is really
coming down.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.469
Hello, you two.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.805
Rosemary, hello.
Always a pleasure.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.242
That is an interesting
shade...

39:06.244 --> 39:07.644
Of plaid.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.948
Oh! Lee is taking me
for a tour of his sawmill

39:11.950 --> 39:12.982
After it stops
raining.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.050
I loaned her
one of my coats.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.952
It is so warm and cozy.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.454
I like to keep you
warm and cozy.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.688
Oh, that's so sweet!

39:20.092 --> 39:23.626
Well, first, the dance
and then, a guided tour...

39:23.628 --> 39:24.994
That's...

39:24.996 --> 39:26.329
Delightful.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.931
Yes, it is delightful.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.566
I took the rest
of the day off

39:29.568 --> 39:30.967
Just so we could spend
some time together.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.635
Have you
seen the mill?

39:33.839 --> 39:38.108
No. I haven't.
I haven't had time.

39:38.110 --> 39:39.943
I've been too busy.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.644
Well, i'll tell you all
about it when i get back.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.246
Goody.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.415
I have to go.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.283
I need to get
to my article,

39:47.285 --> 39:48.251
So if you will excuse me.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.319
Of course.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.154
[lee]: Don't work too hard.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.355
[molly]: Bye, now!

39:52.357 --> 39:54.257
-Shall we?
-Yes!

39:56.828 --> 39:58.828
Thank you.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.332
Mrs. Stanton.

40:02.334 --> 40:04.434
Mrs. Avery?

40:04.436 --> 40:06.102
You promised you wouldn't
see my husband again.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.172
Mrs. Avery, why don't
we go to the cafe

40:09.174 --> 40:10.373
And we can
talk about this?

40:10.375 --> 40:12.442
Why? I have
nothing to hide.

40:12.444 --> 40:13.510
Do you?

40:13.512 --> 40:14.944
Of course not.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.947
I think there's been
a misunderstanding--

40:17.949 --> 40:19.482
There's been
no misunderstanding.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.817
I know for a fact

40:20.819 --> 40:23.019
That you invited my husband
back to hope valley.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.320
And you encouraged
his attention.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.289
I did no such thing.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.791
You're a liar.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.659
I tried to be civil with you
the last time i was here,

40:29.661 --> 40:30.860
But clearly,
you weren't listening.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.295
I have heard enough.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.832
I promise

40:35.834 --> 40:37.567
That you will live to regret
the day that you met him.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.775
[♪♪♪]

40:50.415 --> 40:53.349
This isn't about wanting you
to be something you're not.

40:53.351 --> 40:56.886
And this isn't about wanting you
to fit into hamilton.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.488
And this isn't about the fact

40:58.490 --> 41:00.256
That we come
from two different worlds.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.991
Then what's
it about?

41:04.696 --> 41:06.062
Jack, do you remember

41:06.064 --> 41:08.264
When you told me
that mounties don't get married?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.234
That if they wanted you
to have a wife,

41:11.236 --> 41:13.470
They would've issued you one?

41:14.606 --> 41:17.507
I think they might be right.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.442
When i saw that man
point that gun at you...

41:23.014 --> 41:25.114
It was like i couldn't breathe.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.085
It was like my whole world
was in slow-motion.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.723
What if
he'd shot you?

41:33.725 --> 41:34.724
He didn't.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.459
Not this time.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.895
It scared me, jack.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.063
It scares me to think

41:40.065 --> 41:42.298
That, one day,
you might not come home.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.300
That what happened
to your father

41:44.302 --> 41:46.269
Could happen to you.

41:47.472 --> 41:49.739
I need to be able
to sleep at night,

41:49.741 --> 41:51.140
Knowing you're safe.

41:52.410 --> 41:53.710
I will be safe.

41:53.712 --> 41:54.944
You can't
guarantee that.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.079
No one can.

41:56.081 --> 41:58.481
But i'm good at what i do.

42:00.385 --> 42:03.119
And i'm not afraid

pressing question

51:47.505 --> 51:49.672
Is why did she need
to be told.

Why would a husband
deceive his wife

There's always a scapegoat,
though, isn't there?

52:20.571 --> 52:23.672
I see.
So you blame me.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.573
There you go!

53:30.575 --> 53:32.675
You miss me?
I missed you, too.

53:32.677 --> 53:34.910
Let's go home.

53:37.848 --> 53:39.481
You were so scared!

53:39.483 --> 53:40.583
[rip barks]

53:40.585 --> 53:41.917
[viola]: Father won't be long.

53:41.919 --> 53:43.686
Would you care for some tea
while you wait?

53:43.688 --> 53:45.487
That's very kind.

53:45.489 --> 53:46.689
[rings bell]

53:46.691 --> 53:48.524
Lionel and i are
leaving for the opera

53:48.526 --> 53:49.858
As soon as he arrives.

53:51.128 --> 53:53.229
Some tea.

53:54.966 --> 53:57.666
We missed you
at the club last weekend.

53:57.668 --> 53:59.201
Work has
kept me busy.

53:59.203 --> 54:01.437
My father
has kept you busy.

54:01.439 --> 54:03.772
First to arrive.
Last to leave.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.541
I've told him
to slow down.

54:05.543 --> 54:06.775
He doesn't know how.

54:06.777 --> 54:08.444
[chuckles]

54:10.114 --> 54:11.313
So?

54:11.315 --> 54:13.282
So...

54:14.485 --> 54:16.151
Have you heard
from elizabeth?

54:16.153 --> 54:17.786
She's been on your mind,
hasn't she?

54:23.327 --> 54:24.793
You'll be glad to know

54:24.795 --> 54:26.128
She's safely back
in hope valley,

54:26.130 --> 54:28.797
Once again playing
teacher in the wild west.

54:28.799 --> 54:31.834
Her students must be happy
to have her back.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.168
Please.

54:33.170 --> 54:34.336
You don't have to pretend
to be supportive

54:34.338 --> 54:35.971
Of her little adventure
for my sake.

54:35.973 --> 54:37.072
We both know
it's time

54:37.074 --> 54:38.741
She closes that chapter
of her life

54:38.743 --> 54:39.908
And gets on
with things.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.343
She doesn't seem
to see it that way.

54:41.345 --> 54:44.380
That's why you have to
convince her to come home.

54:44.382 --> 54:45.914
I'm not sure it's my place.

54:45.916 --> 54:47.316
Can you honestly
picture her

54:47.318 --> 54:49.551
Spending the rest of
her life in that town?

54:49.553 --> 54:51.987
Raising a family?
With a mountie, no less?

54:51.989 --> 54:53.722
I'd hope
it doesn't come to that.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.090
Then you need to convince
her to come back.

54:55.092 --> 54:56.825
Because i know
you, charles.

54:56.827 --> 54:58.994
I know how deeply
you care for her.

54:58.996 --> 55:00.696
You always have.

55:00.698 --> 55:03.732
And if you don't tell her
how you really feel...

55:05.002 --> 55:07.836
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

55:13.177 --> 55:15.110
Whiskey.

55:16.247 --> 55:17.613
Mr. Coulter.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.748
What's happening
in the world today?

55:19.750 --> 55:22.351
Well, to be
honest with you,

55:22.353 --> 55:24.920
Not a whole heck
of a lot.

55:24.922 --> 55:27.089
You might want to check
tomorrow's paper, though.

55:27.091 --> 55:28.390
Yeah? Why's that?

55:28.392 --> 55:31.860
Oh, no reason,
i just have a feeling

55:31.862 --> 55:33.796
It's gonna be
a big news day.

55:33.798 --> 55:35.364
Would that have
anything to do

55:35.366 --> 55:38.534
With miss leveaux's
nasty editorial,

55:38.536 --> 55:41.537
The one that
you convinced mr. Bolt

55:41.539 --> 55:43.439
To allow her
to write about me?

55:43.441 --> 55:46.608
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

55:46.610 --> 55:48.243
It does, however, sound
like a page-turner,

55:48.245 --> 55:49.445
Doesn't it?

55:49.447 --> 55:50.646
Mm. Yeah,
it's unfortunate

55:50.648 --> 55:52.648
That it won't see
the light of day.

55:52.650 --> 55:54.650
I just came from
a meeting with mr. Bolt,

55:54.652 --> 55:55.918
And it would seem

55:55.920 --> 55:57.986
That he's not quite
as keen on the story

55:57.988 --> 56:00.556
As he once was.

56:00.558 --> 56:01.523
I see.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.760
You had the story killed?

56:04.762 --> 56:07.896
Well, i simply
suggested to him

56:07.898 --> 56:09.231
That perhaps
there would be

56:09.233 --> 56:11.500
More interesting stories
for him to run

56:11.502 --> 56:13.402
On the front page
of his newspaper.

56:13.404 --> 56:14.770
Oh, i'm sure!
Let me guess.

56:14.772 --> 56:16.305
"mr. Patterson's
prized chicken

56:16.307 --> 56:18.107
Wins blue ribbon
at county fair"?

56:18.109 --> 56:19.108
Something like that?

56:19.110 --> 56:20.676
That is a good one,

56:20.678 --> 56:22.311
But even better--

56:22.313 --> 56:24.680
There is an inspector from
the mounted police in town.

56:24.682 --> 56:27.316
Now, that's something that
i'd like to know more about.

56:27.318 --> 56:29.518
Afternoon.

56:34.425 --> 56:35.591
I'm guessing
the two of you

56:35.593 --> 56:36.759
Weren't making
dinner plans.

56:36.761 --> 56:39.328
I have no idea how
that man always

56:39.330 --> 56:41.530
Manages to land
on his feet.

56:41.532 --> 56:42.831
He's smart.

56:42.833 --> 56:44.533
And dangerous.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.602
You seem to know
him pretty well.

56:46.604 --> 56:48.203
Henry gowen and i go way back.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.607
From what i remember
of the mining trial,

56:51.609 --> 56:53.409
You weren't exactly
best of friends.

56:55.045 --> 56:56.879
Did he say anything
i should know about?

56:58.182 --> 57:00.449
Mm. No. Nothing important.

57:00.451 --> 57:03.085
But i'd watch my back,
if i were you.

57:07.057 --> 57:08.724
[weary sigh]

57:09.827 --> 57:11.760
[♪♪♪]

57:15.299 --> 57:17.299
How's the advice column
coming along?

57:19.737 --> 57:21.370
Well, sometimes, i wonder

57:21.372 --> 57:23.238
If i'm the right person
to be writing it.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.808
Oh, dear. Something
must be terribly wrong

57:25.810 --> 57:27.543
If you're not ready
to hand out advice.

57:27.545 --> 57:29.244
As it turns out...

57:29.246 --> 57:32.181
I think
i could use some myself.

57:32.183 --> 57:33.649
Would this
have anything to do

57:33.651 --> 57:35.217
With lee coulter
and molly sullivan?

57:36.487 --> 57:38.554
Well, it has everything
to do with it!

57:38.556 --> 57:40.989
Oh, i heard you decided
to cool things off with lee.

57:40.991 --> 57:41.990
I did.

57:41.992 --> 57:42.991
And now?

57:42.993 --> 57:44.393
And now...

57:44.395 --> 57:45.661
I think...

57:45.663 --> 57:47.930
I think
i've made a terrible mistake.

57:48.999 --> 57:50.232
Well...

57:50.234 --> 57:52.568
You've had such success
with your column,

57:52.570 --> 57:54.503
Why don't you try

57:54.505 --> 57:56.605
Writing yourself
a letter of advice?

57:56.607 --> 57:59.374
Oh... I wouldn't even
know how to begin.

57:59.376 --> 58:00.876
Let's see.

58:00.878 --> 58:03.011
You could start
with "dear jealous."

58:03.013 --> 58:04.680
I think "hurt and confused..."

58:07.117 --> 58:09.251
...Would be more appropriate.

58:09.253 --> 58:10.519
Are you sure about that?

58:10.521 --> 58:12.521
Yes, quite sure.

58:12.523 --> 58:14.256
All right.

58:14.258 --> 58:15.524
"dear hurt and confused...

58:15.526 --> 58:18.594
"you've clearly made
a terrible mistake

58:18.596 --> 58:19.695
By not following
your heart..."

58:19.697 --> 58:20.762
Yes!

58:20.764 --> 58:22.464
Yes! That's it.

58:23.801 --> 58:25.934
"dear hurt and confused...

58:27.104 --> 58:28.804
"oh, you poor thing.

58:28.806 --> 58:32.708
"you've made
a terrible mistake

"by not following your heart.

have feelings for this man,

"how else can he see

that he's made?"

Abigail...

58:48.425 --> 58:49.658
You're brilliant.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.927
This is
the perfect answer

58:51.929 --> 58:54.963
For poor little
"hurt and confused."

58:54.965 --> 58:56.598
[laughs]

58:56.600 --> 58:57.799
For a moment there,

58:57.801 --> 59:00.569
I forgot that i was
writing to myself!

59:00.571 --> 59:03.071
I guess i haven't
lost my touch after all.

59:03.073 --> 59:04.907
You truly have a gift.

59:04.909 --> 59:06.074
I know.

59:06.076 --> 59:07.442
Now, if
you'll excuse me...

59:07.444 --> 59:10.679
I need to take
my own advice.

59:13.417 --> 59:14.349
[sighs] oh...

59:20.591 --> 59:23.191
Hey, the road ends here.

59:23.193 --> 59:25.761
Follow the fence about
a hundred yards to the east

59:25.763 --> 59:27.429
Until you come
to an abandoned cabin.

59:27.431 --> 59:29.364
Put your back
against the south wall,

59:29.366 --> 59:31.466
Step ahead 20 paces
straight ahead.

59:31.468 --> 59:34.903
Dig down about two feet
and you'll find a metal box.

59:36.140 --> 59:37.839
It has the rest
of the counterfeit bills.

59:43.347 --> 59:45.013
It better.

59:45.015 --> 59:46.715
Or you'll be calling
federal prison home

59:46.717 --> 59:48.617
For the rest of your life.

1:00:05.869 --> 1:00:07.803
Almost
as good as new.

1:00:07.805 --> 1:00:08.971
Good.

1:00:10.741 --> 1:00:12.374
The storm's passed.

1:00:12.376 --> 1:00:14.376
We can head back to town,
if you're up for it.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.046
Can we stay here

1:00:18.048 --> 1:00:19.481
Just a little
while longer?

1:00:19.483 --> 1:00:22.351
Yeah.

1:00:22.353 --> 1:00:23.552
What for?

1:00:26.190 --> 1:00:28.724
In here, it's just
the two of us, and...

1:00:29.927 --> 1:00:32.394
...Out there,
everything is...

1:00:33.764 --> 1:00:35.597
...Complicated.

[chuckles softly]

1:00:37.434 --> 1:00:39.735
Yeah, i know
exactly what you mean.

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:47.776
But whatever challenges
we have to face out there,

1:00:47.778 --> 1:00:50.112
I believe that we can
take them on together.

that i've seen your knees.

I won't be long.

i like the idea

Of having you tend to me
hand and foot,

I'm not an invalid.

1:02:21.672 --> 1:02:23.839
Just a very bad patient.

Well, if you want to
get me that blanket,

1:02:27.544 --> 1:02:28.510
I won't object.

feel like resting.

Oh, no. My father didn't
believe in girls fishing.

While i was home
doing the washing.

1:03:22.533 --> 1:03:25.333
So i made my own pole

And i would sneak
down to the river all by myself.

1:03:27.671 --> 1:03:29.671
Wow.

home empty-handed?

Oh! I wouldn't dare.

1:03:39.449 --> 1:03:41.082
Well,
i'll tell you what,

1:03:41.084 --> 1:03:42.951
I'm willing to bet

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:45.921
That my worms
will catch more fish

1:03:45.923 --> 1:03:47.556
Than whatever
you've using.

1:03:47.558 --> 1:03:49.958
[laughs] well, i don't
want to take your money.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:51.226
Oh, no money.

1:03:51.228 --> 1:03:53.128
Just your pride.

1:03:53.130 --> 1:03:54.796
Wow, you really
are confident.

1:03:54.798 --> 1:03:56.631

1:03:56.633 --> 1:03:58.867
I like that in a woman.

1:03:58.869 --> 1:04:01.102
So what do you say?
Are we on?

1:04:01.104 --> 1:04:03.004
You are on.

anything?

1:05:54.384 --> 1:05:55.417
No.

No, not at all.

1:05:56.653 --> 1:05:58.086
What can i do for you?

1:06:00.824 --> 1:06:02.824
I was hoping
we could talk.

1:06:02.826 --> 1:06:04.492
All right.

1:06:04.494 --> 1:06:06.861

1:06:09.066 --> 1:06:10.565
I feel like

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:12.500
There's been a little
misunderstanding between us--

1:06:12.502 --> 1:06:15.837
About you and me
not wanting the same thing,

1:06:15.839 --> 1:06:16.905
When i think we do...

1:06:18.508 --> 1:06:20.208
...W-want the same thing.

1:06:20.210 --> 1:06:24.245

that we both want?

1:06:26.083 --> 1:06:27.749
[words catch]

1:06:30.354 --> 1:06:32.220
You and i,
we've always been a great team.

Like when
we beat gowen at poker.

1:06:34.358 --> 1:06:36.624
That was fun, yes.
Wasn't it? Yes.

1:06:36.626 --> 1:06:39.260
It was fun!

1:06:39.262 --> 1:06:41.096
So what are you saying?

1:06:42.599 --> 1:06:44.532
Perhaps...

1:06:44.534 --> 1:06:46.134
I could consider

1:06:46.136 --> 1:06:49.104
Entertaining...

1:06:57.748 --> 1:07:00.115
What i meant was

1:07:00.117 --> 1:07:02.183
I didn't want to
make the same mistake twice.

1:07:03.587 --> 1:07:05.320
I've rushed into
things before, lee,

1:07:05.322 --> 1:07:07.255
And i-i made
a terrible mess of things,

1:07:07.257 --> 1:07:09.124
And the worst part--
[takes a halting breath]

1:07:09.126 --> 1:07:11.292
I hurt somebody
that i cared a lot about.

1:07:11.294 --> 1:07:12.994
Jack.

1:07:14.731 --> 1:07:17.465

to have recovered.

He did.

1:07:19.970 --> 1:07:21.669
Yep.

But i want to make sure
i get it right this time.

You do?

Of course i do.

Oh, i really don't want to
have to hurt her feelings.

1:08:18.895 --> 1:08:21.529
You may have to
hurt her feelings

1:08:21.531 --> 1:08:22.964
Just a little bit.

1:08:22.966 --> 1:08:25.733

let her down gently, then.

need to rub it in.

The two of you have been friends

1:10:12.008 --> 1:10:14.209
That you lost your son.

1:10:18.682 --> 1:10:20.215
Unbearable for you.

It's never about

1:11:39.863 --> 1:11:42.196
It's about
what's underneath,

Getting to the truth.

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.733

1:11:45.735 --> 1:11:48.069
I think so.

When we were
in that mine,

1:11:51.608 --> 1:11:54.842
And it felt like...

1:11:54.844 --> 1:11:56.978
It could be the end...

I must say,
this is very exciting.

If we could just keep it

appreciate that.

I noticed a lot of
eligible young men there.

Some of them
were very handsome.

1:13:18.962 --> 1:13:20.762
And dull?

1:13:20.764 --> 1:13:22.997
Oh, i'm sure if
you would at least try,

1:13:22.999 --> 1:13:24.832
You'd find
someone you like.

1:13:24.834 --> 1:13:26.634
Oh, i'm quite sure i wouldn't.

1:13:26.636 --> 1:13:29.771
Well, then perhaps...

1:13:29.773 --> 1:13:32.340
Well, perhaps viola and lionel

1:13:32.342 --> 1:13:35.143
Could introduce you
to some of their friends.

Would you please stop
trying to run my life?

Oh, sweetheart,
since the beginning of time,

1:13:39.682 --> 1:13:40.815

good breeding

Have married young men
of good breeding.

1:13:42.652 --> 1:13:45.119
And they've lived
unhappily ever after.

1:13:45.121 --> 1:13:46.154
Oh, that simply
is not true.

1:13:46.156 --> 1:13:47.789
Just because
tom's gone

1:13:47.791 --> 1:13:49.791
Doesn't mean i've
suddenly forgotten him.

1:13:49.793 --> 1:13:51.426
Maybe it's time you should.

1:13:53.663 --> 1:13:57.231
Or maybe, just maybe,
i don't belong here.

1:13:57.233 --> 1:13:58.966
Nobody cares what i think.
Nobody cares how i feel.

1:14:01.371 --> 1:14:03.070
No, you don't!

1:14:03.072 --> 1:14:04.539
You only care about yourself and
how things look to other people.

1:14:04.541 --> 1:14:05.606
You're wrong about that.

1:14:07.010 --> 1:14:08.876
Well, why do you think
elizabeth left?

1:14:11.147 --> 1:14:13.648
This isn't about elizabeth.

1:14:13.650 --> 1:14:15.583
She wanted a life of her own,
like i do!

1:14:15.585 --> 1:14:16.751
Only she was brave enough

1:14:16.753 --> 1:14:17.885
To go out
and do something about it,

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:19.387
Instead of staying here
and suffocating.

1:14:19.389 --> 1:14:21.689
Your sister will be
coming back, mark my words.

1:14:21.691 --> 1:14:23.391
You know what?

1:14:23.393 --> 1:14:24.592
I hope she doesn't.

1:14:24.594 --> 1:14:26.561
I hope she stays away

1:14:26.563 --> 1:14:28.262
And marries jack thornton
just to spite you.

1:14:28.264 --> 1:14:30.031
How can you say that?

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:31.332
Because you deserve it!

You don't have any respect
for her feelings.

You don't have
any respect for mine!

Will you disinherit me?

1:14:38.341 --> 1:14:39.407
Because i don't care!

1:14:39.409 --> 1:14:40.741
I don't care about

Money, or position, or society,
or any of it!

1:14:42.745 --> 1:14:45.379
I'm going to pretend
i didn't hear that.

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:49.217
The world is changing, father.

Mr. Coulter, i must say
you have excellent taste.

Ah. In flowers,

Don't worry
another minute about it.

1:16:19.008 --> 1:16:20.341
Uh-huh.

It's my granddad's
recipe.

1:16:23.046 --> 1:16:24.445
I don't suppose

1:16:24.447 --> 1:16:25.880
You'd mind sharing it
with me, would you?

1:16:25.882 --> 1:16:28.182
Nope. I'm sworn
to secrecy.

1:16:29.285 --> 1:16:30.618
Well, then

1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:31.953
You'll just have to
make it for me again.

more fish than me.

Speaking of secrecy...

1:16:41.230 --> 1:16:43.297
All i know about you

1:16:43.299 --> 1:16:46.000
Is that your grandfather
likes to fish

1:16:46.002 --> 1:16:47.969
And you're pretty good
with a hammer.

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:50.404
You know, there's not much more
to tell, really.

Oh, i don't
know about that.

1:16:53.343 --> 1:16:56.744

Yeah. That's right.

1:17:00.016 --> 1:17:01.949
What happened?

Well, i made a big mistake
and i paid dearly for it.

But that was a...

1:17:09.859 --> 1:17:12.493
A different life.

1:17:23.272 --> 1:17:24.872
Well, let's just say

1:17:24.874 --> 1:17:27.675
That i didn't always work
on the right side of the law.

1:17:27.677 --> 1:17:30.478
And the reason
that i almost died was...

1:17:32.715 --> 1:17:35.416
I got shot.

1:17:36.753 --> 1:17:38.753
Oh.

1:17:41.457 --> 1:17:43.691
Anyway, i-i...

1:17:44.961 --> 1:17:46.293
I made a promise to god,

1:17:46.295 --> 1:17:48.763
And...

1:17:48.765 --> 1:17:50.631
I said, "god,

No, frank. It's, um...

No, that's okay.
I don't mind.

But i would
appreciate it

If we just keep this
between us.

so understanding.

Yes. Of course.
