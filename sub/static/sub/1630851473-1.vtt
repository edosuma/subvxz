05:02.080 --> 05:04.800
You promised not to just turn up.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.040
Well this is spur of the moment
because it’s important.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.520
I now want it in writing
with a signature.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.280
You're to give me good warning.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.600
Whoa, Mister!

05:13.640 --> 05:15.400
I need your sewing basket.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.760
It's stranded in the kitchen
where your daughter left it.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.960
I need the toilet anyway.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.920
So use the downstairs.
It's for guests.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.080
Oh you think I'm sewing your jeans?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.480
No, but I don't own a kit,

05:30.520 --> 05:32.680
and I don't have the knack
when it's not human tissue.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.600
You're not even gonna
offer me a glass?

05:50.640 --> 05:51.960
You don't drink white.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.640
There's a red on the trolley.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.560
That's the one my mum got
me for Christmas.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.000
Yeh, Christmas before last
when it was for both of us, y'know?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.160
Listen, Val...

06:11.200 --> 06:13.480
I have not missed being called that.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.120
Valerie.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.160
I did come for a word, actually.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.880
I've been meaning to say it for
quite a while now, call it,

06:20.920 --> 06:24.520
Siamese intuition or whatever,
because we're peas in a pod, but

06:24.560 --> 06:27.880
I've recently sensed that
you've started...

06:27.920 --> 06:29.960
..seeing other people?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.480
That is nothing
I need to discuss with you.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.240
No, I know. I know.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.280
But your attitude's changed,
your dress code's rejuvenated,

06:37.320 --> 06:39.520
and you've gone back to
wearing contact lenses.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.960
I just want you to know,

06:42.000 --> 06:43.480
from the heart...

06:44.520 --> 06:46.960
From the heart, you have my blessing.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.120
I just want you to know
I'm cool with that.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.200
Truly?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.360
We're both grown-ups.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.320
It became obvious you needed to
spread out a bit,

06:54.360 --> 06:57.120
if only to find out how good
you had it in the first place.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.640
''S only me!'

07:01.600 --> 07:04.280
Are you two getting back together?
No!

07:04.320 --> 07:06.840
I was being witty. This never
happened when you were a pair.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.760
That's not wit, it's sarcasm.
Still funny.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.960
If you can't tell the difference,
your educational costs

07:11.000 --> 07:12.960
need a serious debate between me
and your mother.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.320
I'm comprehensive.
So not!

07:15.360 --> 07:16.840
I need to be at Rosalind's
in half hour.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.800
I'm gonna get changed.
You still OK to take me?

07:18.840 --> 07:20.240
No.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.240
He can!

07:25.800 --> 07:29.440
Actually, I need to get her
spare keys to the flat.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.840
I left - I broke mine in the lock.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.720
Looking for this?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.600
Things must've got more interesting
than normal

07:39.640 --> 07:40.840
if you got as far as here.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.800
I'll be down literally in two.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.600
You always look peckish to me.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.120
Treat yourself to a can of worms.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.000
Has the clutch gone again?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.760
Your mum strikes me as edgy.
Is everything OK round there?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.320
We're not doing this, Dad.
I'm not mum's keeper.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.400
Asking questions?

08:20.440 --> 08:22.560
Interrogating me about
her boyfriends.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
How many is she seeing?
Plural is fair warning

08:26.640 --> 08:29.080
that I'll wind you up every time you
try pushing me.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.520
But you've seen this latest one,
have you?

08:31.560 --> 08:34.240
Right, you're connected. Watch what
happens when I ring you...

08:34.280 --> 08:36.600
Don't answer.
She'll be yakking for hours.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.880
She just heard that. Hiya Maggy.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.680
I'm in the car with him.
'Hi Flick.'

08:39.720 --> 08:41.360
We're having a family
conversation.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.840
No we're not, that's over.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.720
'This is work. We've had a call
out. There's an industrial death

08:45.760 --> 08:47.760
that needs looking at before
the body's removed.'

08:47.800 --> 08:49.160
'Instead of 'yakking on',

08:49.200 --> 08:51.400
I'll fill you in on the rest
when you get here.'

08:51.440 --> 08:54.800
'Say hi to your mum for me, Flick.'
I will do. Bye.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.600
Right, you can just drop me off
at the white gates here.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.360
No. I'll watch you go in,
and see who lets you in.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.600
What's Rosalind's dad do
for a living?

09:05.640 --> 09:08.160
I don't think she's ever met him but
her mum's a stockbroker.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.440
'Make your way
to the fire assembly point.'

09:21.160 --> 09:23.920
'Please leave by the two exits.'

09:35.040 --> 09:36.440
When I couldn't get hold of you,

09:36.480 --> 09:38.560
I thought I'd have to do this
on my own.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.280
Yonks back in the last century,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.400
I was three weeks into my training
with him when we had to

09:42.440 --> 09:45.360
pick a farmer's wife out of the
blades of a combine harvester.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.000
We were there two days.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.080
Yeah well, I was.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.920
Er, you were the mentor that
didn't need any of us Dot.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.920
Sorry, I wasn't trying to
make you sound older...

09:52.960 --> 09:55.280
Age has got nothing to do with it.
It's the past tense, mate!

09:55.320 --> 09:57.360
Is everybody happy with me
covering photography?

09:57.400 --> 10:00.400
Sod off. I'm senior,
as I've been amply reminded.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.880
You're picking bits out.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.640
I got 'em to double-cup so they
stand a chance of staying warm.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.240
Thank you very much. Who are you?

10:09.280 --> 10:11.920
Dominique Barnette.
We met at the interview last month.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.560
Ah. Begging your pardon.
Context schism. Welcome on board.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.040
Dominique's contract technically
starts at midnight, but,

10:18.080 --> 10:19.800
I called her in for the experience.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.720
They're ready for us in there.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.400
- Who's running the investigation?
- DCI
Chambers.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.760
Wolfe.
Betsy. What've we got?

10:44.920 --> 10:47.120
This's a de-boning machine,

10:47.160 --> 10:49.120
and he was Ted Woyzeck.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.360
50 year old engineer.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.480
He went in to do repairs and,
according to witnesses,

10:56.520 --> 10:58.000
it reactivated itself.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.320
Who was first on the scene?

11:04.360 --> 11:06.280
A Daniel Colley.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.560
A couple of mates ran to help,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.680
but he saw the worst of it
and shut the machine down.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.680
The lights shouldn't have
been affected.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.360
A 50 year old engineer's
presumably pretty experienced.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.480
So how come he didn't isolate the
main circuit before starting work?

11:20.520 --> 11:22.240
Exactly.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.160
We need to rule out foul play.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.440
I'm not being insensitive but
shutting the plant down

11:41.480 --> 11:42.880
is completely out of the question.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.760
We can only just manage to meet
promises with this section closed.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.160
With respect, 'meeting promises'
sounds a bit insensitive,

11:48.200 --> 11:50.520
given what's behind that screens.
And what's not.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.200
We supply three major supermarkets.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.160
It'd just take one breached
delivery for a European company

11:56.200 --> 11:58.120
to step in and obliterate 200 jobs.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.720
So, an event like this could be
in someone else's interest?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.280
Yeh, but steady on.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.080
I don't think anybody'd go
to these lengths.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.680
Again, with respect,
we'll presume to know nothing

12:07.720 --> 12:09.640
until we've examined
facts and evidence.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.600
Can you get your hands on the
machine's blueprint

12:11.640 --> 12:12.880
before we begin extraction?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.000
I'm sure we've got scans
of the original design.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.680
This is impossible!

12:23.720 --> 12:26.160
I can't tell what's human
and what's animal.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.280
Well, this...

12:28.320 --> 12:29.760
..is definitely a human kidney,

12:34.720 --> 12:35.840
But that's,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.440
that's a bulls eye.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.960
Woah!

12:42.360 --> 12:44.760
So, Daniel, who turned
the machine off?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.480
Before Ted went to work,
he isolated the system.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.520
You saw him do this?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.520
Well, not personally,
but he wouldn't not.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.200
Sorry Daniel, I just need to
get inside your mouth.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.560
Can I ask what this is for?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.040
It's a formality, Daniel.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.680
We need to separate people's contact
with the power sockets.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.880
Even ours.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.000
When did you first know
something was wrong?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.160
When we all did.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.480
When he screamed.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.680
How far away were you at the time?

13:14.720 --> 13:17.800
Twenty, thirty yards.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.600
Am I allowed to interrupt?

13:20.640 --> 13:22.560
I'm all done here.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.920
Danny, I'm so sorry you
had to be the one...

13:24.960 --> 13:26.320
Oh good God.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.880
Excuse me?!

13:38.920 --> 13:40.200
I got a phone call,

13:40.240 --> 13:42.600
saying my husband's been involved
in an accident.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.840
Who's in charge?

13:43.880 --> 13:46.840
Steve, this lady's husband's been
involved in an accident.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.240
Ted Woyzeck. Do you know where he is?

13:53.560 --> 13:55.920
If you just go up there,
someone will see to you.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Careful. We don't want
to lose the stomach contents

14:13.040 --> 14:15.480
if we can avoid it.
Don't move anything yet.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.400
The snake's hit obstacles.
Just two secs!

14:18.600 --> 14:22.320
Okay, I've got good shots
of the chest cavity.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.560
What's left of it.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.080
And you're clear of the stomach,

14:28.120 --> 14:29.640
there.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.320
You can start the extraction!

14:47.320 --> 14:48.720
Betsy!

14:53.440 --> 14:55.640
Daniel Colley said in his statement
- twice-

14:55.680 --> 14:58.480
that he was closest
to the machine when it happened.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.640
But look.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.360
Daniel, we're slightly concerned

15:09.400 --> 15:11.800
that you lied in your initial
statement.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.400
No, I didn't.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.840
You claimed you were the closest
operative to the machine,

15:15.880 --> 15:17.160
and the stop button.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.640
But here, on camera two,

15:20.360 --> 15:22.840
we see you sending this kid
in the opposite direction.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.200
What's being said here?

15:26.240 --> 15:30.520
Him screaming... I mean,
"I can't help!"

15:30.560 --> 15:33.640
"Well, go and
get someone who can!"

15:35.040 --> 15:37.520
He was in total shock at the sound
coming from the machine.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.840
Vomiting as he ran.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.480
I let him go, but he came back
anyway, with help,

15:45.520 --> 15:46.720
and joined in.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.480
Are you
right-handed or left, Ben?

15:50.520 --> 15:53.200
Tell us what's happening here,
what's being said?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.400
I can't.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.800
I can remember one sound,
and that's it, I threw up,

16:02.840 --> 16:03.920
that's it!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.840
If Danny said anything,
I can't help you.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.800
You've a conviction that wasn't
declared on your employment record,

16:10.840 --> 16:12.480
which is, in itself, a violation.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.960
I've never missed a single probation
appointment.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.080
It's nearly spent.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.480
Did you have any grievances
with Ted Woyzeck?

16:20.440 --> 16:21.600
No.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.040
We only saw him when
something went down.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.080
He spent most of his time
inside the machines.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.040
We never had a beer with
him or anything.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.840
Could you go behind that screen
over there,

16:32.880 --> 16:35.880
remove your outer clothing and take
anything from the pockets, please?

16:40.520 --> 16:42.560
They were sexually assaulting
my girlfriend.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.640
It was five-to-one.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.480
I knocked one of 'em to the ground.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.920
He got a brain bleed and died.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.360
They were gonna rape
her in front of me.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.520
We sent for some overalls for you.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.720
He can wear these to go
collect his personal belongings

17:00.760 --> 17:01.840
and then go home.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.480
I want them dry cleaned
and returned within seven days.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.080
And you're fired.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.320
You were told at your interview,
Ben,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.880
you can tell me anything
as long as it's not a lie.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.360
That's instant dismissal.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.320
Mrs Belby, I missed it off
cos it's nearly spent.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.520
You ran in the opposite direction.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.360
For everyone's information, the
body is now off the premises.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.280
So can we start sterilising
the machine now?

17:22.320 --> 17:23.400
No.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.240
We're declaring it a crime scene.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.960
What're you thinking?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.160
You can't mention this to
that kid's probation team.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.440
From what we heard on the shop floor,

17:45.480 --> 17:47.040
he was honest with his workmates,

17:47.080 --> 17:48.560
and they trusted him back.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.280
That's all I'm saying, Betsy.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.280
Oh thanks. I should be getting
you one after all that.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.320
I never don't return a
favour, team strap-line.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.400
You were very fluid tonight,
Dominique.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.080
Instinctive choreography
gets noticed.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.800
Cheers for that, but,

18:15.840 --> 18:18.440
I'm not at my best when
I'm feeling watched.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.120
I just want to say,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.400
thanks, Professor,

18:26.440 --> 18:27.960
for giving me the break.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.800
No, no, no.
That was a panel decision.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.800
But hats off to you for shining.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.040
Thanks.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.320
Authorised University staff only
allowed into the basement,

18:44.360 --> 18:47.480
students get day passes,
for when they do demonstrations.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.240
By the way, you're expected to do
two lectures a month.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.600
Contract says one.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.640
Yeah, the other will be
one we've missed

18:53.680 --> 18:55.680
and the other will take the subs.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.800
You don't need one of these.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.960
I just don't like touching switches.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.440
Where're we at?

19:27.480 --> 19:29.200
We're still waiting for DNA
to come back,

19:29.240 --> 19:30.680
but Dominique's ID'd most prints.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.040
These are Ben Pulman's,
and these are Ted Woyzeck's.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.400
I took his print using saline on the
severed right hand

19:37.440 --> 19:38.720
because it's the only one intact.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.480
This is my fault, but Daniel's
prints didn't scan properly,

19:41.520 --> 19:42.800
we've got blank blotches.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.480
I'll ask him to come in for
a digital scan.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.880
He starts the machine
in the mornings.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.600
Then Ted Woyzeck did the same
before entering the machine.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.040
Before, as we see, he did
obviously hit the stop button.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.400
Wow! Did you sleep here?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.240
Didn't switch itself on, though,
did it?

19:56.280 --> 19:59.320
Let's get a full cross-section
of CCTV footage to go at,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.160
but especially in that sector.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.800
OK I'm off to my lecture.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.640
So we're not talking about
finger prints biometrically.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.960
In your future professional career
cleaning up society,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.320
if and when you qualify,

20:11.360 --> 20:14.040
this level of evidence
is only the beginning.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.320
The bio molecular base
of a fingerprint

20:17.360 --> 20:21.640
contains untold information, if you
have the right spectrometry.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.640
So, before the summer break,

20:25.680 --> 20:26.960
we asked all 2nd year students

20:27.000 --> 20:29.320
to submit fingerprint samples
from last thing at night.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.760
You remember?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.000
OK.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.360
Of the 40 submitted,

20:34.400 --> 20:37.120
a tenth didn't use soap
after urinating.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.800
Eight showed traces of cocaethylene,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.880
y'know, the booze and cocaine combo;

20:43.920 --> 20:48.600
and literally one in four showed
psychological support medication.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.360
Ohh!

20:51.400 --> 20:52.760
Welcome to the club!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.120
Ignorance is the bigger shame.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.960
We were even able to determine

20:58.000 --> 21:01.600
the condom you use
through PEG analysis,

21:01.640 --> 21:04.520
Polyethylene Glycol.
Right?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.320
But here's the best bit.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.440
65 percent of all the condom samples

21:09.480 --> 21:11.760
were found on female prints.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.000
Ladies,

21:14.040 --> 21:16.320
unless their assets outweigh
their excuses,

21:16.360 --> 21:18.240
if they can't be bothered
to carry a condom,

21:18.280 --> 21:19.280
do not give it up.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
It would be cruel to point out

21:25.640 --> 21:28.160
that you weren't supposed to put
your names on the samples.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
But everyone did.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.760
Relax.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.040
The names get separated
before the analysis,

21:37.080 --> 21:39.040
and the samples
have been incinerated.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.480
OK, so what's the take-home t-shirt
for today?

21:41.520 --> 21:43.320
Hygiene, OK?

21:43.360 --> 21:48.760
Moderation and Tolerance.
Or Hands, Knees and Bumpsadaisies.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.040
Okay, get out!

21:52.000 --> 21:53.800
Leave!

21:53.840 --> 21:55.000
Leave me alone.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.720
Swap you a good chunk of pancreas

22:02.760 --> 22:05.800
for the lower right lobe
of the liver.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.840
Sorry we're late, Maxine,
but we come in pieces.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.160
Blessing, if I'm honest.
I've had my mother on the phone

22:13.200 --> 22:15.760
from literally the middle of
another roundabout.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.840
You've all this to come with yours.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.280
How's living alone?

22:21.320 --> 22:23.760
It took me bloody ages,
but I'm loving it now.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.000
Nothing but guard dogs.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.240
Fierce protection
and they love me to death.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.360
That's all I ever wanted!

22:28.400 --> 22:30.000
How do you know we're
living separately?

22:30.040 --> 22:32.800
How do you know this much about
everybody? From in here?

22:32.840 --> 22:35.120
I think I ran into your wife on a
court day, looking,

22:35.160 --> 22:37.520
if I dare say, unburdened.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.560
Shall we get on?

22:40.600 --> 22:43.200
I couldn't run the full post-mortem
because we didn't have all organs,

22:43.240 --> 22:44.800
but we did run the tox screens.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.800
He hadn't used so much as an
Aspirin in three months.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.840
No booze, no drugs, no
medication, no meds prescribed.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.400
None of that excludes suicide,

22:52.440 --> 22:54.160
so you've always got to keep an
open mind.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.680
On y va!

23:01.000 --> 23:04.120
As Maggy says, suicide can't be
ruled out, but as it stands,

23:04.160 --> 23:07.320
we've got two suspects based only on
their proximity to the death.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.000
And that's Daniel Colley,
Ben Pulman.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.720
I just went to the lab and realised
it's the post-mortem. I'll join you.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.960
Sorry, half the organs,
half the time.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.600
No offence, Ted.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.760
Records have pulled-up
a previous death

23:21.800 --> 23:23.960
with a version of the
same machine at a different factory.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.120
The same company?
No, but the same machine design.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.560
In that incident,
a guy called Vincent Frayn

23:29.600 --> 23:32.160
got sent down for 7 years
for murdering a colleague

23:32.200 --> 23:34.720
by pushing him into
moving parts after a grievance.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.120
Shepherd's Meats and Packing?

23:39.160 --> 23:41.440
That's the circle of life
right there in a tin!

23:41.480 --> 23:44.960
Okay folks, Betsy's thrown
another option into the mix.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
The machine's now also a suspect.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
Dot you need to get to
Shepherd's Meats and Packing.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.520
We need photography of the
innards of the sister machine.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.120
Sorry, is that gonna happen
without a warrant, or

23:54.160 --> 23:56.560
Not without charm, which
is why I've asked you.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.880
Just blag your way in.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.600
I shall be needing Dominique.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.520
Dominique, I need you to
look official.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.600
That's never happened before.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.920
Get a full field DNA
screening kit together.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.760
Betsy, get two fast-tracked
visitors' orders to wherever

24:10.800 --> 24:12.760
Vincent Frayn's being held.
I'll request DNA.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.880
Am I coming with?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.920
Not without me, you're not.
Make it three then.

24:15.960 --> 24:19.160
Meet me in the car park in half
an hour. I'm driving.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.320
And I'm left doing, what?
The rest of it?

24:23.360 --> 24:24.960
Have you cracked
Ted Woyzeck's phone?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.400
No, it's triple encrypted.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.640
There's your answer.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.920
I um,

24:38.960 --> 24:41.720
I came to see if you're alright,
Wolfe.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.640
I'm tickety-boo, thanks for asking.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.600
By the way, what does...
that mean?

24:47.360 --> 24:51.400
Come on, why is your desk this tidy?

24:51.440 --> 24:55.680
And your recent behaviour,
coming round to mine,

24:55.720 --> 24:57.760
it's not not erratic?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.160
Please don't be defensive.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.560
I tidy up my desk and ask you a few
questions about your social life,

25:02.600 --> 25:04.520
and you're still calling 'em
'manic phases.'

25:04.560 --> 25:06.240
It's the way you asked.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.400
And, yes, it's the way
you've tidied.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.520
These are all relapse signatures,

25:10.560 --> 25:12.560
and I'm only bringing your
attention to them now-

25:12.600 --> 25:15.560
It is not compulsive behaviour.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.800
Clear your clutter,
clear your mind.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.080
It's Chapter Five.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.560
I'm following orders.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.560
Who knows by Chapter Ten,
the walls might have to go-

25:25.600 --> 25:28.240
It was explicitly my sex life,

25:28.280 --> 25:30.800
not my social life that you were
interrogating,

25:30.840 --> 25:33.360
which is way off, and you know it.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.600
It'll only take ten minutes.
I haven't got ten minutes.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.200
Shift changes in 15. Why can't
I put the cameras in then?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.960
Because that's when the blades
get flushed and steamed.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.440
If you're suggesting it's still a
potential crime scene,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.320
I'm stopping nothing
without a warrant.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.400
That at least gives me
two days' notice.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.760
Not if the Health and Safety Exec
demands it.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.720
Can I speak to your line manager?

26:04.600 --> 26:08.360
I weren't being shitty not meeting
you in the Visitors' cave.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.000
But I wasn't expecting anybody.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.160
And I cherish the sunshine.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.520
We only get three days a week
out here.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.800
That's no problem.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.200
Real farm to table, eh?
You've got everything.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.640
All this gets sold to restaurants.
We get frozen.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.840
I'm just sitting in, Vincent.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
These gentlemen are from
Forensic Sciences

26:28.920 --> 26:30.680
with some technical enquiries,

26:30.720 --> 26:34.280
and we'd also like another DNA
sample with your permission.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.760
Yeah. What's it about?

26:35.800 --> 26:39.080
Any questions we have relate to your
memory of logistics of the day,

26:39.120 --> 26:41.720
we are not police, we are not looking
to cross examine you, or

26:41.760 --> 26:44.920
ask you to impart new information...
Unless you have it.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.040
But other people could potentially
be in jeopardy

26:47.080 --> 26:49.760
if we don't start getting straight
answers to simple questions soon.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.960
That's an interesting bracelet.
Are they blisters?

26:53.000 --> 26:56.120
No. If you don't seal your clothing,
the flies get over the gloves.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.400
Botfly.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.120
You have to suffocate 'em
with blister plasters.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.440
The main reason they keep me here?

27:06.520 --> 27:10.600
The jury was told that I had a
grievance with my mate

27:10.640 --> 27:12.840
over two and a half grand!

27:12.880 --> 27:14.840
That's a lot of wages.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.560
He's owed me a lot more before,

27:16.600 --> 27:18.480
and always paid eventually.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.600
You were also convicted on the basis
of a palm print on the start button?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.640
One on the start, two on the Off.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.480
That's because I tried to
reboot the blade motors.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.040
On and off in a split second.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.480
He was dead by then anyway.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.400
Half his head had gone!

27:33.440 --> 27:36.880
I've a three year old
grandchild I've never held.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.800
That's 'cos I won't plead guilty

27:38.840 --> 27:41.360
for something I haven't done.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.480
Okay, well, our questions are all
about the machine, Vincent.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.440
Which can only be in your interest,

27:48.480 --> 27:49.600
fair do's?

27:51.520 --> 27:54.520
This's how I accessed the last one,
it's meant to be identical,

27:54.560 --> 27:56.120
but it won't go through.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.360
Can you see the torch?

27:58.560 --> 27:59.880
Yeah, now I can.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.160
Okay. I'll hold the line.
You can get in through here.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.120
Can you not stand there?

28:06.160 --> 28:09.000
Oh, relax. I'm gay.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.840
But I can't speak for the other
twelve.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
Fine, cover me.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.080
Fuck off!

28:19.760 --> 28:20.760
When we get back,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.040
I need you going over the footage
against the blueprints.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.200
Could you just...

28:24.240 --> 28:25.760
What's that?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.760
Rufus's phone number.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.040
And a note.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.760
Saying what?

28:30.800 --> 28:31.880
"I'm not gay."

28:31.920 --> 28:33.520
We were both bending over!

28:33.560 --> 28:35.360
Why didn't I get a
fucking phone number?

28:35.400 --> 28:37.040
Dot-dot-dot.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.560
What?

28:38.600 --> 28:40.680
How do you get 'Dot' from Marcy?

28:40.720 --> 28:42.760
How'd you think? Dot-dot-dot.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.200
I'm always the last to
be thought of among this rabble!

28:45.240 --> 28:46.400
It never ends.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.920
I bet you make sure you're not.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.520
Louder and longer.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.720
Oh, boss!

28:57.520 --> 29:00.360
The DNA samples that
you asked me to run?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.560
I got a name. D'you want it?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.640
Uh, Jeff Joyce.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.320
Two-three, zero-three, Seventy
Seven. Does that mean anything?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.480
Maggy's got something to show us.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.840
No- that- mm.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.800
Maggy.
Boss. I cracked dead Ted's phone.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.880
You wouldn't know it now, but,

29:23.920 --> 29:25.840
he was a well-hung fella.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.400
And most of his dick pics
went to... three guesses?

29:28.440 --> 29:29.680
Uh, um prostitutes?

29:29.720 --> 29:30.920
Ben Pulman?

29:30.960 --> 29:34.000
Delores Belby.
Yeah! They were having a thing.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.040
No way!

29:35.080 --> 29:37.520
The later texts say she was more or
less shutting things down.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.640
Another extenuator for suicide.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.200
Good old Delores, banging the
engineer. Ding Dong Belby!

29:43.240 --> 29:45.840
Delores and Darren Belby
were both off the premises

29:45.880 --> 29:48.320
at the time of death.
Says who? They're each other's alibi.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.680
And this would explain her
level of grief on the day.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.520
Yes, I am still holding but my
patience won't...

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
Gone again.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.440
Look, I really need to speak
with some privacy-

29:59.480 --> 30:04.480
I just want a simple legal opinion
about the loss adjustment numbers.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.720
This was sent from Ted's phone.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.600
Could you confirm that you received
it?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.200
Will his wife have to find out?

30:15.240 --> 30:17.000
Is there any possibility
your husband did?

30:22.280 --> 30:25.000
He wants to know if you
found out about Ted.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.320
Then, be my guest, Darling.
You must tell him.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.000
Look, it's not a recent thing.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.280
Me and Darren have always had
an open marriage.

30:35.320 --> 30:37.400
People come and go without damage

30:37.440 --> 30:39.040
and we remain devoted.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.480
Ted wasn't damage?

30:40.520 --> 30:42.040
He seemed relieved to be out of it,

30:42.080 --> 30:44.320
and I'm sure I wasn't his
only excursion.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.480
Plus, he'd just sold a patent,

30:47.520 --> 30:50.120
so all in all I think
he was skipping, to be honest.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.200
Patent for what?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.400
Another machine.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.400
Ted designed the machines?
Most of them.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.840
This is just for elimination.
What isn't?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.200
She said she'd leave the file in the
back room.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.040
Keys are on the string.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.480
Seriously?

31:34.520 --> 31:35.840
Round here?

31:57.640 --> 31:58.840
That's it. Let's go.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.640
Surprise! Happy Birthday!

32:03.440 --> 32:05.640
Wow! Thank you, thank you!

32:05.680 --> 32:08.560
This is just to say thank you to you
for leadership,

32:08.600 --> 32:11.200
inspiration and guidance
and for the start of another year.

32:15.880 --> 32:19.080

others, belong to us as well."

32:21.480 --> 32:24.720
My thanks to all of you, especially
Dot for hosting us all...

32:24.760 --> 32:25.760
again.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.200
And there's nothing wrong with
'round here' by the way.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.680
Right, let's drink like billy
goats and wreck the joint.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.040
Oh, no need. Dot's started already.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.920
Hey.
What?

32:39.920 --> 32:41.800
Your mum's left you
drinking on your own?

32:44.200 --> 32:46.280
Mmm. Serves you right!

32:46.320 --> 32:49.000
I'm glad you live on your own,
'cos you'll be farting for freedom.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.320
Mum wasn't invited,
but she sent a card.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.960
Just a card?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.520
How old are you?

32:57.320 --> 32:58.480
Wow.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.000
Look at that.

33:03.040 --> 33:06.560
44 and a 17. That is bang on.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.600
I specifically asked for a
two-finger, button-down

33:08.640 --> 33:10.560
and they sent me everything but.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.520
This was three times lucky.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.720
Thank you.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.200
Betsy, you've had calls.
They said your phone's off.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.880
Because I'm off duty.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.800
Oooh!

33:29.120 --> 33:32.320
Are you sure you're not flogging a
dead horse there, darling?

33:32.360 --> 33:34.320
We've never played Poker,
have we, Dot?

Yeah?

33:35.880 --> 33:38.200
'Yeah, we've been trying
to get hold of you...'

33:42.000 --> 33:43.360
Hold this.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.560
It's a Bluetooth
electro-dermo stress monitor.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.880
I hope it does muzak,
because this is boring.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.280
Except when I say something like

33:51.320 --> 33:53.000
"I'd have thought Val
would've been here".

33:54.000 --> 33:56.320
Why don't I keep the transmitter
and you keep the graphics?

33:56.360 --> 33:57.880
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

Hi, Daniel.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.240
We're really sorry for
what you had to go through.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.000
We've got a few blind spots on the

I'd like to scan it digitally, K?
Sure.

done, you fucking catalogue?!

quick word about...

35:53.960 --> 35:56.600
Ha! I'm guessing you're going through
the rebirth experience

35:56.640 --> 35:58.320
that all promotions bring?

35:58.360 --> 36:00.160
Sorry?
If you're anything like me,

36:00.200 --> 36:02.280
you have the permanent post that you
always wanted,

36:02.320 --> 36:04.880
but you hadn't banked on standing in
a different pair of shoes.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.800
It's like my mentor used to
say,

36:06.840 --> 36:08.920
"It's like going to big school.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.360
You have to swap attitude
for intelligence.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.520
All growth spurts are painful."

36:13.560 --> 36:16.440
Plus, seeing how good Dominique is,
the last one in,

36:16.480 --> 36:18.280
that must be choking you.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.440
Your mentor was from Dundee,
why's he got a German accent?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.840
You know what I mean.
Yeah.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.920
Only too well, which is more
than I can say for you.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.800
My problem is that intelligence
keeps equalling attitude,

36:29.840 --> 36:31.720
because I see how gormless
they are sometimes,

36:31.760 --> 36:33.800
and I want to smack their faces.
Especially Dot's.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.880
Why Dot's?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.960
She doesn't like taking orders
from someone younger.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.680
Then stop making them
sound like orders,

36:38.720 --> 36:40.960
and try not deliberately sounding
this much younger.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.120
Yes!

36:43.000 --> 36:45.360
Boss, you need to come
and see this.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.040
These look like histamine bumps, but
Daniel can't remember getting them.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.360
Do they hurt or itch?

36:51.400 --> 36:54.640
No. At first, I thought,
new rescue kitten. Fleas.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.360
But my wife and son
are clean as whistles.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.000

36:58.040 --> 36:59.480
I've never heard of it.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.880
Are you squeamish, Daniel?

37:03.440 --> 37:04.480
Yeah!

37:04.520 --> 37:06.760
It's better done than explained,
but these need to come out.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.680
These, what?

37:08.720 --> 37:10.680
Like stings?
Something like that.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.920
You're a Botanist.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.360
Yeah. I got a first from Cambridge.

How long did it take
to slide that in!

37:17.960 --> 37:19.320
I shoulda set my clock.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.280
I can feel that inside.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.800
Yep.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.680
And this is why.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.360
Here we go!

Woah, woah woah.

other buggers while he's out.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.680
I need this DNA prepped
for Y-STR analysis.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.200
Could you do that for us?

37:49.240 --> 37:51.040
Well, actually,
I'm in the middle of something.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.800
It's an important job so I'd really
respect your age on this.

37:53.840 --> 37:57.640
Sorry, what's age got to do
with a database enquiry?

37:57.680 --> 37:58.760
I just want you to know

37:58.800 --> 38:01.360
there's no difference whatsoever
between yours... or mine.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.040
This clutch here...

38:07.080 --> 38:09.000
is why you couldn't get the
camera in the machine

38:09.040 --> 38:12.320
at Shepherd's Meats and Packing,
but managed to at the Belby Factory.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.600
Alright, OK, well that helps.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.280
I was right.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.080
You could've waited for
me to say that.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.600

38:20.640 --> 38:23.840
This is the guy serving
seven years for murder,

38:23.880 --> 38:25.640
for shoving his mate
into a boning machine

38:25.680 --> 38:27.920
at Shepherd's Meats and Packing
three years back.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.040
Daniel Colley is
Vincent Frayn's son.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.040
How the hell did you get to that
conclusion?

38:34.080 --> 38:35.080
Botfly.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.960
Because me and Steve went to
see Vincent Frayn

38:37.000 --> 38:38.800
at Belmont Prison, 76 miles away-

38:38.840 --> 38:41.120
Where they'd had an
outbreak of Botfly.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.080
Frayn works in the prison gardens.
His wrists were covered in 'em.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.600
The prison had an open day
in autumn,

38:45.640 --> 38:47.480
and Daniel was on the
visitors' list.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.720
No way!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.920
We're glad something cheers you up!

38:50.960 --> 38:53.000
We need to schedule a
briefing with Betsy's team.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.880
We need guidance on how to proceed.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.680
You alright there?

39:09.720 --> 39:11.200
It's for Ted's family.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.120
And that's
before the night shift dips in.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.440
Sit down, Daniel.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.640
Did you deliberately remove the
safety clutch on this machine

39:20.680 --> 39:22.760
to prove a point about your
dad, Vincent Frayn?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.640
If the machine Ted built killed
Ted, that's Ted's fault.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.280
Show me a clutch on the blueprint.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.840
Okay, bring the van round
to loading bay three.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.960
For Daniel's sake,
we should do this discreetly.

39:40.200 --> 39:44.040
Three days old! Three days old!

39:48.760 --> 39:50.080
Daniel!

39:51.200 --> 39:53.680
There's no escape, Daniel!

39:53.720 --> 39:55.280
Daniel, they've got you anyway!

39:57.040 --> 39:58.200

40:02.720 --> 40:04.200
- It'll have to be this!
Fuck!

40:06.520 --> 40:07.640
Oh fuck.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.640
Nooooo!

40:22.680 --> 40:24.600
Fuck're you blaming me for?!

40:24.640 --> 40:26.040
No-one fucking move!

40:27.160 --> 40:29.400
Don't need telling twice!

40:29.440 --> 40:30.680
Come on, Daniel.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.200
You've achieved what you set
out to do 3 years ago.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.000
Your dad's release is imminent.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.120
For 3 years I lost the man
I love the most.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.760
I can see why.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.240
Vincent's a smashing bloke.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.000
Depending on what happens
at your trial,

40:42.040 --> 40:45.000
he might have to
lose you for a while, Daniel,

40:45.040 --> 40:48.000
but face facts, everything that
happened is everything you wanted.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.760
Just one more favour and
then we're clear.

41:00.800 --> 41:03.520
Young Ben Pulman did not
deserve to lose his job...

41:03.560 --> 41:05.040
I'm sorry. 'Clear of what?'

41:05.080 --> 41:07.600
Any guilt at what our private lives
involve?

41:07.640 --> 41:09.280
And that needs 'favours'?

41:09.320 --> 41:12.000
No, fuck off,
you've sadly misjudged us.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.760
Any 'judgement' you might've
detected only comes from one thing.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.200
The fact that one of you
suggested it first

41:17.240 --> 41:19.160
and the other one's just tagging
along.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.240
(POWERFUL MUSIC

41:31.640 --> 41:32.720
To the team!

41:34.080 --> 41:38.360
And... To the sales assistant of the
year, best ever newcomer,

41:38.400 --> 41:39.920
Dominique!

42:30.440 --> 42:32.440
Oh, hi, Val!

42:32.480 --> 42:34.880
I thought you'd be out anyway,
I was just dropping something in.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.880
Legal something. Just dropping it in.
Legal what?

42:36.920 --> 42:39.760
Just stuff in case anything happens
to any of us in the meantime.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.680
I should've said 'formal'
not 'legal'...

42:41.720 --> 42:43.120
Which meantime?

42:44.640 --> 42:47.280
Just so's you know,
everything goes to you.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.000
You and Flick, if I die.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.240
Die of what?

42:50.280 --> 42:51.920
Who knows? Nits!

42:53.280 --> 42:54.280
Uh.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
I would just leave your half
directly to Flick.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.880
Why are we even discussing this now?

43:00.920 --> 43:04.280
Because I need you to know that you
are very, very special to me.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.720
You're the least shareable
person I've ever met.

43:07.760 --> 43:11.240
You will always be special to me,
Wolfe Kinteh,

43:11.280 --> 43:13.200
till the day I die.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.360
So, what are you doing with
somebody like 'JayJay,'

43:20.400 --> 43:22.760
who's the diametrical opposite?
He has nothing to do with this!

43:22.800 --> 43:24.040
That's what you call him!

43:24.080 --> 43:25.320
He might smile more than I can,

43:25.360 --> 43:27.000
but he looks like
he went for a colonic-

43:27.040 --> 43:28.520
Wolfe...
and nothing came out.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.000
..turn around now and keep walking.
What does your law firm think

43:31.040 --> 43:32.720
about the fraud charges
around his neck?

43:32.760 --> 43:34.320
Er... Fact-Check-Land!

43:34.360 --> 43:37.400
All charges were dropped when the
CFO was found guilty on all counts.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.040
Google Translate! Money mad scrubber
who throws his mate under a bus.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.440
Again, why the total opposite of me

43:43.480 --> 43:45.360
if I came even this close
the first time?

43:46.720 --> 43:49.160
You didn't get this from Facebook.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.920
What've you been up to, Wolfe?

43:52.160 --> 43:56.160
If you've been spending public money
trying to sabotage my private life,

43:56.200 --> 43:59.280
are you even aware of the criminal
consequences?

44:00.240 --> 44:02.120
I can't wait to see this in print.

44:02.160 --> 44:04.760
No, please, please, Val! I'm begging
you. Do not say divorce. Please!

44:04.800 --> 44:07.720
I meant the fucking headlines,
you twisted creep.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.400
Never set foot in this house without
written invitation,

44:11.440 --> 44:13.000
or I'll lodge this conversation,

44:13.040 --> 44:15.560
and your pension won't be worth shit
to Flick.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.120
Lucky for her, mine's
all she'll need.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.480
He came in bits, he left in pieces.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.280
A, Don't tempt me,

44:27.320 --> 44:29.880
and B, Since you've obviously
rehearsed that,

44:29.920 --> 44:32.000
you shoulda predicted
how this would end.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.600
Fuck. Off.
