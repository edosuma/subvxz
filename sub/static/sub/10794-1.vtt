to them as it is to us.

We found one address
 we can dial from
 this position.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.793
It's currently locked out,

13:46.826 --> 13:48.996
probably because it's
 at the extreme range
 of the gate.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.899
But I can
get around that.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.234

If it's viable,
we send them.

 They're still working on
 some of our men.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.174

14:04.611 --> 14:06.213
She could prove to be
 useful down the road,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.515
and moving her now
 would be as good
 as killing her.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.650
What about Rush and
 the others that are
 still missing?

 will find them.

 tell the others.

You never did
answer my question.

 what's happening on the ship?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.946

 It's kind of
 hard to explain.

We're good, T.J.
 We're good. We're surviving.

The others
 will be along soon.
 Word's getting around.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.849
We were hoping we
could see the baby.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.587
Sure. Yeah,
she's sleeping...

Don't worry,
 we'll be really quiet.

 Okay?

15:32.032 --> 15:35.802
It's big news around here.
 You want to take a walk?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.672

 of dark, isn't it?

15:39.706 --> 15:42.275

 Dead.

 just like you.

They came out of nowhere.
 They? There was more than one?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.034
I'm not sure.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.935
Did you see them?
 No.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.906
Interesting.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.710
Because you weren't shot
 from behind.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.816
It was dark,
 it happened fast.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.920
I saw Kiva get shot.
I turned, everything
went black.

 enough time to determine
 long-term viability.

There's not
 a lot of options here.

you've got nothing to lose.

take my gun,
kill the guard outside.

But how far do you
really think you'd get?

17:56.443 --> 17:59.446
You'd be shot, and your
people would still be
sent to the planet,

27:47.934 --> 27:49.736
Mr. Brody,
 seal the door.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.686
The next
 pulsar blast will be deadly
 to anybody outside this room.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.355
That's the whole point,
isn't it?

28:12.458 --> 28:14.393
Damn it!

28:14.426 --> 28:16.028
Sergeant! I'm moving!

28:19.198 --> 28:20.900
Rush, this is Scott,
 come in, please.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.103
Scott, this is Eli.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.537
(OVER RADIO)
 Where are you?

28:25.571 --> 28:28.941
SCOTT: We are cut off.
 We can't shoot our
 way through.

28:28.975 --> 28:31.110
ELI: Well, we haven't
 sealed the door yet.
 There's still time.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.079
We'll dial up the shields
 until you get back.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.914
That'll just give them
 more time to find you.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.682
Our only chance is
to stick with the plan.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.984
Seal the door.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.088
Do it.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.401
T.J.?

28:55.434 --> 28:56.468
What have you
 done with her?

28:56.502 --> 28:57.436
DANA:
 We haven't
 done anything.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.973
(BABY GURGLING)

29:21.193 --> 29:23.129
I'm not leaving
without her.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.631
(BABY CRYING)

29:26.532 --> 29:29.235
It's not up to us.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.637
They can send you back
 whenever they want,

29:31.670 --> 29:33.973
and there's nothing
 we can do about it.
 I'm so sorry.

29:35.674 --> 29:38.577
At least this way
 you'll know,

29:38.610 --> 29:43.015
you'll always know that
 she's being taken care of.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.470
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

30:09.141 --> 30:10.676
Everyone still
 alive in here?

30:10.709 --> 30:13.012
For now.

30:13.045 --> 30:16.482
YOUNG: There's no sign
the storm's letting up,
so get comfortable.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.150
How much longer
can it last?

30:18.184 --> 30:21.120
I don't know, you tell me.
 You're the one who picked
 this place.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.855
It could
go on for days,
for all we know.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.823
It was this or the barrel
 of a gun, and you know it.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.659
(JAMES GROANS)
 YOUNG: James!

30:28.928 --> 30:32.298
Hey, James! James!

30:32.331 --> 30:34.633
Easy, easy.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.701
I got you. Easy

30:35.734 --> 30:37.069
(GROANING) That really hurt.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.138
I'll bet.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.073
Don't move.
 You're going to be okay.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.608
(GROANING)

30:47.279 --> 30:49.148
Have you restored
 the shields yet?

30:49.181 --> 30:50.983
Rush is still
 bleeding power
 from the system.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.684
We can't stop him.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.888
It's worse than
we thought.

30:55.922 --> 30:57.589
The next radiation
 spike from the pulsar

30:57.623 --> 30:59.258
will collapse
 the shields completely.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.827
Now they know.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.262
They've no choice
 but to surrender.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.701
They found us.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.203
ALLIANCE SOLDIER: (ON RADIO)
 Dannic, we've found a door
 we can't open.

31:11.237 --> 31:14.173
Hydroponics.
 It appears to be
 sealed from the inside.

31:14.206 --> 31:18.044
We've got them.
 Get some explosives.
 We'll blow the door.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.679
(PANTING)
 You can't do that.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.882
Any blast big enough to
 get you through the door will
 kill the people on the inside.

31:23.916 --> 31:25.251
We need Rush to
 restore the shields.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.553
GINN: There isn't
 enough time anyway.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.289
The next pulsar wave
 is in less than
 five minutes.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.624
Dannic, this is Rush.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.593
By now
 you know the situation.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.263
You have no choice.
 Lay down your weapons

31:37.296 --> 31:41.033
and order
 your people to assemble
 in the observation deck.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.768
Once I receive
 visual confirmation

31:42.801 --> 31:44.903
of your compliance,
 I'll dial up the shields.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.044
I still say
 you're bluffing.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.879
RUSH: Our position
 is well protected.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.082
Even without the shields
 we'll survive the next wave.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.217
You won't.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.619
Either way,
 we take the ship back.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.893
I don't know.
 It's possible.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.162
The man is a coward.
 He wouldn't sacrifice himself.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.930
He's telling the truth.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.603
You still
 have people out here.
 You'd be killing them, too.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.277
A necessary sacrifice.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.850
He won't do it.

32:31.883 --> 32:32.751
Dannic!
Enough.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.653
You don't have a choice...
I said enough!

32:38.224 --> 32:40.292
We're not giving up
this ship.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.797
He's not bluffing.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.100
Just wait.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.968
He doesn't even know
 we're watching.
 This isn't an act.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.309
You can't do this.
You'll kill us all.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.748
We were
 prepared to die the moment
 we stepped through that gate.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.717
You're insane.

33:06.885 --> 33:07.919
(GROANS)

33:09.321 --> 33:11.657
Did you...
 Did you just see that?

33:11.690 --> 33:14.826
This guy is nuts. You can't
 reason with someone like that.

33:21.433 --> 33:25.104
So, what about the others?
 What about Scott and
 Greer, T.J.?

33:34.846 --> 33:35.947
I'm sorry.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.732
Listen to me.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.103
You know
 why we came here.

33:58.937 --> 34:02.040
You know
 what this ship means.

34:02.074 --> 34:06.745
Are you really
 prepared to let it go
 just when it's in our grasp?

34:06.778 --> 34:09.281
You mean your grasp.

34:09.315 --> 34:12.083
Don't listen to him.
 He's crazy.
 He will kill all of us.

34:12.118 --> 34:15.721
No. Just anyone who
tries to get in my way.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.889
(GUN FIRING)

34:28.967 --> 34:32.003
Telford is right.
 He was crazy.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.380
Rush?

34:42.414 --> 34:45.083
Dannic is dead.
 We'll comply
 with your demands.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.272
Carmen.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.975
That's her name.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.878
After her grandmother.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.252
I know it's
 not perfect here,

35:20.286 --> 35:24.790
but you said yourself
 it's better than that ship.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.293
I still think there's a chance
 they're going to help us
 get back home.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.832
If they could do that,
 then why haven't
 they done it already?

35:33.865 --> 35:36.302
I don't know.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.837
Look, T.J.,
 I have to warn you.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.475
No one on the ship
 is going to understand.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.044
I barely
 understand myself.

35:46.077 --> 35:50.849
No, I...
 I mean they won't believe,

35:50.882 --> 35:53.185
because what
 they've seen is different.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.423
What are you
 talking about?

35:59.491 --> 36:03.929
(SIGHS) I have learned
 one thing in all of this,

36:05.364 --> 36:09.468
and it's that out here
 on the edge of the universe,

36:09.501 --> 36:14.473
who you are and what
 you believe is everything.

36:14.506 --> 36:19.110
So it's up to you to decide
 if this is a blessing or
 a curse.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.085
Goodbye, T.J.

 Ah, it's okay.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.037
Just take it easy.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.877
How long was I gone?

36:53.412 --> 36:54.680
What do you mean?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.315
How long was I off the ship?

36:59.050 --> 37:02.954
You were here the whole time,
 and the doctors worked on you.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.959
They did the best
 they could, but...

37:10.462 --> 37:12.097
I'm so sorry.

Well done, Lieutenant.
