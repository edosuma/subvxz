00:00.879 --> 00:03.601
Everyone who has ever lived has thoughts and experiences

00:03.647 --> 00:05.962
that they carry with them their entire lives.

00:06.826 --> 00:11.051
Most people think these thoughts and experiences die with the person when they pass on.

00:11.116 --> 00:14.322
But I believe there are certain individuals who are especially sensitive

00:14.410 --> 00:16.505
to the thoughts of the living and the dead.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.430
Now if you buy into my theory,

00:21.582 --> 00:25.448
that means there's a kind of collective consciousness out there,

00:26.149 --> 00:30.180
a kind of giant filing cabinet filled with all the thoughts of everyone

00:30.220 --> 00:32.457
who has ever lived just floating around

00:32.615 --> 00:34.762
waiting to be received by someone.

00:44.012 --> 00:46.241
And the challenge for people like me

00:46.630 --> 00:47.934
would seem to be

00:48.463 --> 00:50.999
how do you sort through the din?

00:51.255 --> 00:54.673
How do you know which of the millions of voices to listen to?

00:55.390 --> 00:57.428
Normally it's not a problem.

00:57.510 --> 00:59.194
I hear one voice at a time,

00:59.599 --> 01:01.361
see one vision at a time.

01:01.836 --> 01:03.848
And whatever I'm hearing or seeing

01:04.668 --> 01:07.955
is usually being shown to me for some important reason--

01:08.549 --> 01:10.704
a crime, a missing person,

01:11.263 --> 01:12.845
a crisis of the heart.

01:13.935 --> 01:18.456
Except when I get sick, and I start taking medicine.

01:19.050 --> 01:23.545
Then there's no telling whose head I'm going to pop into or out of.

01:23.629 --> 01:24.877
Off with her head.

01:25.793 --> 01:27.728
Down with Versailles.

01:28.645 --> 01:30.498
Let her eat cake.

01:30.677 --> 01:33.960
Ungrateful bastards. Have you actually tried cake?

01:34.164 --> 01:37.652
It's not like I said, "Let them eat brussels sprouts."

01:40.544 --> 01:41.625
What's going on?

01:42.318 --> 01:43.335
You okay?

01:44.169 --> 01:47.517
Yeah, I'm okay. I just have a sore throat.

02:34.569 --> 02:36.296
Say "donuts" again. Say "donuts" again.

02:36.936 --> 02:39.388
Dodut. Dodut, dodut, dodut.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.081
What are you doing out of bed?

02:42.327 --> 02:44.094
I'm standing. It's good.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.901
When I was laying there, I couldn't breathe.

02:46.193 --> 02:49.485
The alarm goes off, I pour cereal. It's Pavlovian.

02:49.562 --> 02:52.342
You still have a temperature. Did you take your medicine yet?

02:52.480 --> 02:55.998
I don't like it. It makes me sleepy, and then I have weird dreams.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.830
Really? You? How can you tell?

03:00.421 --> 03:02.219
You know, you don't take your medicine,

03:02.884 --> 03:04.768
you're never going to shake this thing.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.912
I know. Believe me, once everyone's fed and out of here,

03:08.004 --> 03:10.294
I am going to park myself on that couch,

03:10.394 --> 03:12.735
have lots of fluids and watch lots of TV.

03:12.884 --> 03:14.134
And take your medicine.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.033
And take my medicine.

03:27.352 --> 03:31.357
Up next on TV Time Capsule, it's I Married A Mind Reader

03:31.424 --> 03:35.929
starring real-life husband and wife Abigail Marsh and Henry Stoller.

03:39.395 --> 03:40.911
Oh, my gosh.

03:47.874 --> 03:49.364
Oh, Henry.

03:50.194 --> 03:51.648
You're home early.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.969
Happy Anniversary.

03:53.071 --> 03:55.389
And here I was starting to think you'd forgotten.

03:55.513 --> 03:56.921
Me? Never.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.155
Go ahead, open it.

03:59.997 --> 04:03.495
Oh, Henry, they're beautiful.

04:03.572 --> 04:04.693
Aren't they though?

04:04.797 --> 04:06.445
Real imitation pearls.

04:06.567 --> 04:09.629
Saved myself a bundle and she'll never know the difference.

04:12.007 --> 04:14.171
Henry, you shouldn't have.

04:14.382 --> 04:16.346
You can say that again.

04:17.535 --> 04:19.536
Only the best for you, honey.

04:20.105 --> 04:22.398
- Let's try them on.
- Yeah.

04:25.552 --> 04:27.513
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.968
Hey, Me.

04:29.132 --> 04:32.561
Listen, I just spoke to the Perellis and Valerie said I could drop the girls off with her

04:32.593 --> 04:34.426
after school so you can get a break.

04:34.517 --> 04:36.499
No, it's okay, you don't have to.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.855
Um, it's done, so thank me later.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.276
Um, what are you doing? Resting, I hope.

04:41.388 --> 04:42.886
Absolutely.

04:42.981 --> 04:45.485
You're not going to believe what I just stumbled across--

04:45.567 --> 04:49.746
this show I used to love when I was a kid, I Married a Mind Reader.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.434
You're kidding, there's a show like that?

04:51.547 --> 04:53.406
I'm suing for invasion of privacy.

04:53.488 --> 04:57.205
Come on, you never heard of it? It's an old show from the '60s.

04:57.583 --> 05:01.214
It starred Abigail Marsh and Henry Stoller?

05:01.326 --> 05:03.179
You know, they were married in real life.

05:04.614 --> 05:05.750
Hey.

05:06.601 --> 05:08.326
Okay, I've heard of it, I guess.

05:08.796 --> 05:11.951
Um, wasn't that, like, years before you were born?

05:12.052 --> 05:13.281
I used to watch the reruns.

05:13.369 --> 05:15.913
They haven't shown them in years. I guess because of the scandal.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.733
Oh, okay, I'll ask-- What scandal?

05:19.819 --> 05:22.176
Henry Stoller, the husband?

05:22.261 --> 05:26.311
At the height of the show's popularity, he shot his wife to death.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.966
I'll bet that hurt the comedy.

05:28.693 --> 05:32.774
Okay.  I can hear how bored you are, but this is serious.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.558
Until I found out that he killed his wife,

05:35.698 --> 05:38.558
I had the biggest crush on him.

05:38.656 --> 05:41.196
Oh, well, who am I to stand in the way of true love?

05:42.047 --> 05:44.028
I'll just let you two get reacquainted.

05:44.349 --> 05:47.493
Oh, it's so nice to have a husband who understands.

05:47.677 --> 05:49.874
All right. Say "hi" to Henry for me.

05:50.635 --> 05:53.366
What do you know? He says "hi" back.

05:57.995 --> 05:59.515
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.

05:59.618 --> 06:01.184
So tell me, where did you get them?

06:01.925 --> 06:03.591
Why Tiffany's, of course.

06:03.975 --> 06:05.895
They'll need to be insured.

06:05.998 --> 06:09.224
Why don't I take them into the city tomorrow and have them appraised?

06:09.331 --> 06:12.285
Oh, boy, my goose is cooked now.

06:13.884 --> 06:14.953
Tell you what.

06:15.306 --> 06:18.046
Why don't I do it, save you the trip?

06:21.330 --> 06:23.057
I'm sorry, give me that again.

06:26.949 --> 06:27.957
You know what?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.796
Why don't I do it, save you the trip?

06:30.144 --> 06:31.434
That's not it.

06:31.527 --> 06:33.713
- What, that's not what?
- I'm lost.

06:33.812 --> 06:35.356
- For God's sake, Abigail.
- Cut.

06:35.418 --> 06:37.988
I need a script. Dorothy, where's my script?

06:39.253 --> 06:40.317
Dorothy?

06:42.914 --> 06:44.352
Here you are, Mrs. Marsh.

06:45.135 --> 06:46.007
Thank you, dear.

06:51.874 --> 06:52.902
I've got it.

06:57.157 --> 06:58.513
From your line.

07:00.466 --> 07:01.478
Quiet everyone.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.317
And we're rolling.

07:04.181 --> 07:05.160
And...

07:06.718 --> 07:07.530
action.

07:07.838 --> 07:10.433
I'll  take them in, save you a trip to the city.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.313
I have a better idea, darling.

07:12.503 --> 07:16.380
I'll come into town for lunch and afterwards we can take them in together.

07:18.319 --> 07:19.471
And cut!

07:20.228 --> 07:22.466
Fabulous, Abby. Great work, Henry.

07:22.537 --> 07:24.928
All right, people, that's a wrap.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.786
Damn you, Henry. You do it on purpose.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.481
- What's what?
- Change the damn lines.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.014
Oh, lover, just trying to keep things fresh.

07:32.082 --> 07:33.535
Well, it throws me off.

07:33.623 --> 07:35.538
Why don't we just stick to the damn script.

07:36.204 --> 07:37.068
All right.

07:37.741 --> 07:38.641
Come here.

07:39.481 --> 07:42.894
It says here it's time to go to the Dresden for drinks.

07:42.982 --> 07:44.846
Now we're on the same page.

07:47.513 --> 07:48.860
Give me ten minutes.

07:52.883 --> 07:54.605
Why don't you come along, Dorothy?

07:54.777 --> 07:55.879
- Me?
- Sure.

07:55.956 --> 07:57.179
Ever been to the Dresden?

07:57.257 --> 07:59.929
No, I didn't think someone like me could even get in.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.870
Well, you'll like it. It's fun.

08:02.187 --> 08:02.950
Okay.

08:03.109 --> 08:03.856
Good.

08:04.372 --> 08:06.191
You can help me with my nails in the car.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.514
Oh, darling, did I tell you?

08:20.593 --> 08:23.169
The network called and asked if we'd like to participate

08:23.210 --> 08:26.553
in the opening ceremonies at the New York World's Fair next year.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.178
That's exciting. I heard that's going to be amazing.

08:32.635 --> 08:33.386
Yeah.

08:34.519 --> 08:36.072
I love that sort of thing.

08:36.441 --> 08:37.424
Progress.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.764
The future.

08:40.981 --> 08:42.196
Something wrong, dear?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.355
You two. You're so excited.

08:47.101 --> 08:51.176
One of the advantages of being ever so slightly older

08:51.233 --> 08:57.168
is that you realize that the future is nothing more than another today.

08:59.102 --> 09:00.864
It's just that when you get there

09:01.303 --> 09:05.785
you have more yesterdays behind you and fewer tomorrows to look forward to.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.455
That's my Abigail.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.058
Her glass is perpetually half empty.

09:17.385 --> 09:18.819
There's Sean Connery.

09:21.415 --> 09:22.265
Wow!

09:22.921 --> 09:26.091
Boy, I'd like to be his cigarette.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.875
Yeah, they talked to me about James Bond.

09:30.534 --> 09:32.849
Locked into our television show. Couldn't get out.

09:34.003 --> 09:35.659
I wouldn't want to.

09:36.314 --> 09:39.945
Gee, Mr. Stoller, you would've been amazing in that part.

09:40.590 --> 09:43.098
Well, we'll never know.

09:43.329 --> 09:47.599
Oh, please, you don't have to stroke his ego, Dorothy.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.970
His ego, along with every other part of him, has been stroked quite enough in this lifetime.

09:53.165 --> 09:54.865
Well, thank you for bucking me up, darling.

09:55.709 --> 09:58.654
Now, if you two ladies will excuse me,

09:58.730 --> 10:01.720
I do believe I see my agent sitting across the room.

10:02.942 --> 10:04.582
And he has to be nice to me.

10:05.289 --> 10:06.441
I pay him ten percent.

10:08.352 --> 10:09.098
Excuse me.

10:16.259 --> 10:18.011
Have you ever been in love, Dorothy?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.400
I don't know, Mrs. Marsh.

10:22.717 --> 10:23.956
I guess not.

10:25.731 --> 10:27.632
It's the ultimate performance.

10:30.913 --> 10:33.173
I need to visit the powder room.

10:33.285 --> 10:34.274
Would you excuse me?

10:35.124 --> 10:36.510
You're excused.

10:42.651 --> 10:44.115
God, you scared me.

10:44.207 --> 10:46.633
See, I remembered you like it scary. You like it dangerous.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.206
- Really?
- Really.

10:54.232 --> 10:57.377
Come on, seriously, aren't you afraid someone will see?

10:57.576 --> 10:59.280
No. You?

11:05.136 --> 11:07.914
God, I hate her. I wish she was dead.

11:08.009 --> 11:10.365
Don't say that. America loves her.

11:10.481 --> 11:12.792
So what's the problem? They can love her when she's dead.

11:12.853 --> 11:14.722
Didn't hurt Jimmy Dean's career.

11:15.193 --> 11:17.395
- Now you're scaring me.
- Good.

11:24.093 --> 11:25.402
What are you doing?

11:27.124 --> 11:27.999
Dorothy?

11:37.007 --> 11:38.239
What  are you doing?

11:38.976 --> 11:39.913
What are you doing?

11:40.508 --> 11:41.311
Mom...

11:42.149 --> 11:44.250
Mom... Are you okay?

11:46.108 --> 11:47.178
Mommy.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.673
Mom, are you okay?

11:53.844 --> 11:56.994
Wow. Talk about a fever.

12:17.060 --> 12:19.061
What are you looking for this hour of the night?

12:19.798 --> 12:21.108
Drugs  from Canada?

12:21.810 --> 12:24.564
A fast and convenient way out of credit card debt?

12:24.937 --> 12:26.904
A thicker, longer penis?

12:28.844 --> 12:30.033
Who's that?

12:30.969 --> 12:33.700
My preteen crush, Henry Stoller,

12:33.786 --> 12:36.679
one of the stars of I Married a Mind Reader.

12:37.617 --> 12:42.440
I had a torrid little scene with him this afternoon while you were picking the girls up from school.

12:42.516 --> 12:45.316
Really? The famous wife killer?

12:45.568 --> 12:48.731
You two got together, and he rubbed Vapo Rub on your chest?

12:49.787 --> 12:52.029
This guy's got to be, like, 100 by now, right?

12:52.147 --> 12:55.843
He's 84, but it was this Henry, the young one, that I...

12:58.424 --> 12:59.781
You don't want to know.

13:01.821 --> 13:04.558
Um, so what are we talking here?

13:04.762 --> 13:06.493
Some-Some kind of a dream?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.381
Answer slowly, 'cause I want to remember this

13:09.442 --> 13:12.284
so that I can repeat it to a divorce lawyer in the morning.

13:12.443 --> 13:15.975
I don't know. I was watching TV, and then next thing I knew, I worked there.

13:16.042 --> 13:17.225
Making the show.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.695
My name was Dorothy.

13:19.339 --> 13:21.971
I told you this medicine had a strange effect on me.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.223
I have a confession to make.

13:24.562 --> 13:26.007
I had a dream once.

13:26.194 --> 13:28.996
It was after I saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

13:29.161 --> 13:30.752
It involved Phoebe Cates.

13:31.588 --> 13:33.721
There. Now you know everything.

13:34.007 --> 13:35.257
Dirty boy.

13:35.527 --> 13:36.978
Here's the weird thing.

13:37.362 --> 13:39.867
You can't possibly say that with a straight face.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.931
When I was on that I Married a Mind Reader Web site,

13:44.028 --> 13:49.347
I looked at the credits for the show, and it said "Assistant to Mrs. Marsh, Dorothy Graybridge."

13:49.415 --> 13:52.829
Dorothy. That's who I was. Dorothy Graybridge.

13:52.907 --> 13:54.897
I didn't make her up. She's a real person.

13:54.985 --> 13:57.955
Okay. So obviously, you saw her name on the credits of the show,

13:58.047 --> 13:59.679
and it stuck in your subconscious and...

13:59.753 --> 14:02.307
I don't think so. I don't remember seeing the credits.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.125
Okay. So, what's your explanation?

14:04.334 --> 14:07.841
You had an imaginary hot time swapping phlegm with a guy you've never met,

14:07.898 --> 14:09.735
but had a thing for since you were 12.

14:09.858 --> 14:11.452
Where are you going with this, Allison?

14:12.992 --> 14:14.037
You're right.

14:17.109 --> 14:18.697
I don't know.

14:19.117 --> 14:21.087
You're right, you're right.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.262
I think you're right.

14:23.464 --> 14:24.466
Say banana.

14:24.851 --> 14:27.909
Badana, badana, badana.

14:28.357 --> 14:30.820
I mean, why can't I have a dream that's just a dream?

14:30.949 --> 14:32.719
Why does everything have to mean something?

14:32.791 --> 14:33.658
There you go.

14:33.723 --> 14:34.716
Say toothpaste.

14:36.453 --> 14:40.205
Doothpaste, doothpaste, doothpaste.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.903
Yeah. I think that's what it was. It was just a dream.

14:43.958 --> 14:46.406
Just some crazy, hot kind of dream.

14:47.251 --> 14:48.658
Did you have a bad dream, Mom?

14:49.520 --> 14:53.358
No. I'm just taking this medication.

14:54.444 --> 14:55.693
Say toilet paper.

14:56.211 --> 14:58.760
Stop it! That is totally obnoxious.

14:58.851 --> 15:00.035
You're obnoxious.

15:00.822 --> 15:02.943
Why?  Cause I said toilet paper?

15:03.047 --> 15:04.742
Toilet paper's not bad.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.716
It's natural. Right, Mommy?

15:06.798 --> 15:09.400
- Dad?
- Okay. Enough about toilet paper.

15:09.470 --> 15:13.562
Okay? I'm driving you guys to school again today, so, let's wash up and get going.

15:14.838 --> 15:16.630
The only thing is that Dorothy thing.

15:16.732 --> 15:17.778
I explained that.

15:18.406 --> 15:21.953
Right. Saw it, retained it, used it in my dream.

15:32.852 --> 15:35.466
Thanks so much for helping me with this, Marilyn.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.609
I've always wanted to throw a surprise party for Abigail.

15:40.668 --> 15:42.813
The ballroom at the Roosevelt Hotel?

15:43.326 --> 15:45.000
Well, that sounds like a fine idea.

15:45.090 --> 15:48.644
Why don't we meet there in half an hour and have a look?

15:48.988 --> 15:51.798
I'm just going to dash off and do a few errands.

15:52.075 --> 15:53.924
Be back in a couple of hours.

15:54.150 --> 15:55.270
All right, dear.

15:55.942 --> 16:00.478
Perfect! I can spend an hour with Marilyn at the hotel, and she won't even know I was gone!

16:02.290 --> 16:05.665
So, what is it you're doing today, darling?

16:06.801 --> 16:11.389
Oh, it's so, uh, beautiful out, I-I thought I might go hit a bucket of balls.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.393
Aha. That sounds like a fine idea.

16:14.675 --> 16:16.109
Give me that again, Abby.

16:16.201 --> 16:18.500
This time, uh, play it a little more hurt.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.940
You know what? I'd really rather not.

16:26.478 --> 16:28.776
Did I not give you the right line, darling?

16:28.858 --> 16:30.865
You're always giving me a line, Henry.

16:31.122 --> 16:32.939
Is there anything I can do, Mrs. Marsh?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.214
Is there anything you can't?

16:37.383 --> 16:39.558
I guess I'm not feeling very well.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.969
If you have what you need, I'd really like to go home.

16:43.062 --> 16:45.047
Of course, Mrs. Marsh.

16:45.728 --> 16:46.952
That's a wrap.

16:48.003 --> 16:49.704
Would you like me to drive you, dear?

16:49.793 --> 16:51.006
I'll be fine.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.686
That's why we have a driver, darling.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.109
I'll gather your things and meet you in the limo, Mrs. Marsh.

16:55.185 --> 16:57.582
That won't be necessary. I'm gonna go home and rest.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.883
Perhaps Mr. Stoller could use a hand this afternoon.

17:05.773 --> 17:10.029
Actually, Dorothy, why don't you come by the house tonight around 7:00?

17:10.099 --> 17:12.142
You and I can run lines together.

17:13.647 --> 17:16.075
Of course, Mrs. Marsh. 7:00.

17:32.562 --> 17:34.345
I just know, she knows.

17:35.050 --> 17:35.880
Okay.

17:37.692 --> 17:39.239
Come on, let's get this over with.

17:40.001 --> 17:41.107
I'm sorry.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.094
I can't do it.

17:43.554 --> 17:44.799
I can't go in there.

17:44.926 --> 17:47.646
I know it has to be done. I know there's no other way, but I...

17:47.744 --> 17:49.284
I-I can't be there.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.644
I can't do it with you.

17:51.757 --> 17:54.225
But you want this, too, right?

17:54.578 --> 17:56.709
You're the one who said that she was a monster.

17:56.780 --> 17:57.169
Yeah.

17:57.225 --> 17:59.780
You're the one who said that she and the show are holding you back.

17:59.897 --> 18:00.696
Yeah.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.393
You're the one who said that your future was with me.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.201
Yeah, all that's true...

18:09.186 --> 18:10.272
but I can't.

18:13.753 --> 18:16.215
Well then, I'll just have to do it myself.

19:19.555 --> 19:20.799
- Hi.
- Good Morning.

19:20.852 --> 19:23.309
Hey, I didn't expect to see you today. I heard you weren't feeling well.

19:23.365 --> 19:26.386
I'm feeling much better, thanks. I really need to see him.

19:28.611 --> 19:30.042
You killed her?

19:30.133 --> 19:31.209
Well, not me.

19:31.656 --> 19:32.741
Dorothy.

19:33.215 --> 19:38.377
Dorothy Graybridge. The woman that I was being in my dream or my vision or whatever.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.744
I see.

19:40.277 --> 19:42.914
And... why do I care?

19:43.001 --> 19:44.440
You sound like my husband.

19:44.527 --> 19:45.981
I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.934
And there's no one who believes in getting to the truth more than I do,

19:48.996 --> 19:51.301
but you're talking over 40 years ago.

19:51.377 --> 19:52.928
All these people could well be dead.

19:53.010 --> 19:55.356
And I don't hear a hue and cry to reopen this case,

19:55.402 --> 19:58.577
and I'm guessing this all took place in California.

19:58.653 --> 20:00.717
I'm not even licensed to practice law in California.

20:00.788 --> 20:01.741
I know that.

20:01.981 --> 20:06.127
But if you could just get someone to see if these people are alive.

20:06.262 --> 20:08.183
Dorothy or Henry.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.486
I  would really like to see them.

20:11.331 --> 20:12.154
California?

20:12.410 --> 20:13.792
You're going to California?

20:13.885 --> 20:15.769
Well, they haven't found Dorothy yet, but it turns out

20:15.820 --> 20:19.353
that Henry Stoller is still alive and he's in prison there.

20:19.701 --> 20:22.927
And Devalos pulled some strings and arranged for me to meet with him tomorrow.

20:22.994 --> 20:26.305
Great. Maybe you could bring along one of your old stuffed animals, and you can get him to sign it for you.

20:26.352 --> 20:28.175
- That's not nice.
- Good. It wasn't meant to be.

20:28.231 --> 20:30.556
The guy's been in prison for the last 40 years.

20:30.626 --> 20:33.857
Hey, I've been taking the kids back and forth to school all week.

20:33.919 --> 20:35.502
- Oh, so that's what this is?
- I didn't kill anyone.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.427
Joe is feeling tired.

20:37.489 --> 20:39.726
That came out the wrong way. What I meant to say was...

20:39.809 --> 20:41.507
- You pick them up from school.
- ...you just got over being sick...

20:41.595 --> 20:43.321
- Valerie's gets them from there.
- If, in fact, you're really over it.

20:43.397 --> 20:46.086
- Then you swing by and pick them up...
- She has a long way to go.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.795
- ...when you're coming back from work.
- It's an awful lot of trouble to go to...

20:47.862 --> 20:50.657
...make sure Ariel does her math homework, give Marie her ear drops...

20:50.729 --> 20:52.295
- ...reaction to some bad medication...?
- You know what,

20:52.352 --> 20:56.509
if you did this every day for the next five years we still wouldn't be even.

21:02.018 --> 21:03.560
What am I doing? If you have to go, you have to go.

21:04.276 --> 21:04.973
Thank you.

21:05.050 --> 21:08.213
Hey, if your boss thinks this is worthy of a plane trip and a hotel room...

21:08.377 --> 21:10.738
- Actually, he's not paying for it.
- Excuse me?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.846
It's not official business. It didn't even happen in the state of Arizona.

21:13.912 --> 21:16.345
Wait a second, who's paying for the ticket? Who's paying for the hotel?

21:17.748 --> 21:18.690
We are.

21:19.944 --> 21:23.144
I'm using some of the money that I've been making.

21:26.443 --> 21:29.708
That's my cab. Could you get the girls so I could say good-bye to them please?

21:42.001 --> 21:42.954
I'm sorry?

21:44.021 --> 21:45.503
You are?

21:46.051 --> 21:48.037
Mr. Stoller... I'm Allison Dubois.

21:48.115 --> 21:51.053
I'm with the District Attorney's office in Phoenix, Arizona.

21:53.215 --> 21:54.238
Strange.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.505
You look familiar.

21:58.769 --> 22:01.257
But I don't know anyone in Arizona.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.677
Of course, I don't know anyone anywhere anymore.

22:07.810 --> 22:09.966
Thank you for meeting with me today.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.990
I want you to know it's such an honor to meet you.

22:14.452 --> 22:16.556
I used to watch you on television.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.083
They're starting to show them again, you know.

22:23.837 --> 22:26.537
The reason that I'm here today, is...

22:27.646 --> 22:30.303
I've been investigating your wife's murder...

22:30.928 --> 22:34.180
and I believe there's been a gross miscarriage of justice.

22:34.249 --> 22:37.794
With your help, I think we can reopen the case

22:38.168 --> 22:39.514
and get to the truth.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.654
Miss...

22:43.932 --> 22:48.618
I'm sorry, I... I just can't hold names in my head anymore.

22:49.003 --> 22:51.851
As much as I'd like to say that were true,

22:52.776 --> 22:54.690
I'm afraid it just isn't.

22:55.473 --> 22:58.407
There's been no miscarriage of justice.

22:58.689 --> 23:05.038
I was properly tried, and convicted a long, long time ago.

23:05.146 --> 23:08.971
- I know that you confessed to her murder, but...
- What else is there to know?

23:10.343 --> 23:13.235
I shot my wife in cold blood.

23:14.153 --> 23:19.610
There's not a day goes by that I don't wish I could undo it, but I can't.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.222
I'm an old man.

23:23.670 --> 23:27.291
And frankly, this is not something that I wish to discuss.

23:29.021 --> 23:30.700
Thank you for the visit,

23:31.411 --> 23:32.784
but I...

23:33.824 --> 23:36.419
I'm really rather tired right now.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.051
I feel like a jackass.

23:55.180 --> 23:58.246
Well, unfortunately, I don't know where to buy a good jackass in California,

23:58.318 --> 24:00.514
so I think you're just plumb out of luck.

24:00.612 --> 24:01.902
Don't you do that--

24:02.096 --> 24:04.846
don't you be nice, don't you be funny, not when I've been so...

24:04.881 --> 24:09.061
How did it go in Alcatraz, or Folsom, or wherever the hell it is you are?

24:09.126 --> 24:10.069
Oh, Joe...

24:10.319 --> 24:12.475
The dream you dreamt is not the life he lived?

24:13.267 --> 24:15.187
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

24:16.048 --> 24:17.348
So how are the girls?

24:17.441 --> 24:18.756
Happy. Eating pizza.

24:18.854 --> 24:20.933
Pizza? What about my lasagna?

24:21.040 --> 24:24.353
I'm just hazarding a guess here, but when you said 15 minutes,

24:24.420 --> 24:27.476
you meant the "oven" oven, right? Not the microwave?

24:29.576 --> 24:33.467
So, anyway, I guess I'll fly home tonight.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.637
Now listen, the District Attorney's office called here

24:35.679 --> 24:38.367
and they said that they found that Dorothy Graybridge you were looking for.

24:38.690 --> 24:42.954
I left the adress in your hotel. So, if you wanted to stay over and maybe try and see her tomorrow.

24:43.086 --> 24:45.100
I got this completely under control here.

24:45.197 --> 24:48.058
See, there you go again-- being nice.

24:55.018 --> 24:56.056
May I help you?

24:56.277 --> 24:59.916
I was wondering if it might be possible to speak with Dorothy Graybridge?

25:00.377 --> 25:02.415
Oh, are you family?

25:02.630 --> 25:05.442
No, no, I'm more like a distant acquaintance.

25:05.580 --> 25:09.487
Oh, I'm sorry, but Miss Graybridge passed away yesterday.

25:10.044 --> 25:11.104
She did?

25:12.711 --> 25:13.941
I'm terribly sorry.

25:14.135 --> 25:16.311
If you want to leave your phone number, I could give it to the family

25:16.383 --> 25:17.827
and see if anyone's interested in talking to you.

25:17.919 --> 25:20.510
No, no, no. I didn't really know her that way.

25:20.597 --> 25:23.956
I just wanted to ask her about a TV show she used to work on.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.501
I Married a Mind Reader?

25:25.697 --> 25:27.165
We know all about that.

25:27.606 --> 25:31.114
You know, she'd been in a deep coma for that past six weeks.

25:31.277 --> 25:34.134
But when we heard they were showing that series again,

25:34.221 --> 25:38.010
we started to turn on her TV every afternoon and turn the volume up.

25:38.281 --> 25:40.549
Now I don't know whether or not she could hear it,

25:40.713 --> 25:43.504
but I'm here to tell you, her brain wave activity--

25:43.666 --> 25:46.822
when that show was playing it spiked like crazy.

25:46.919 --> 25:47.794
Really?

25:49.336 --> 25:50.375
Would you excuse me?

25:52.106 --> 25:53.545
I'll be back for the rest tomorrow.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.041
Excuse me, sir?

26:04.155 --> 26:05.244
I'm sorry.

26:06.642 --> 26:07.778
Are you speaking to me?

26:22.937 --> 26:25.278
I am perplexed, young lady.

26:25.908 --> 26:28.120
Did we not speak yesterday?

26:28.560 --> 26:32.891
What could possibly be different other than that I'm a day older.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.827
I met your son.

26:35.589 --> 26:38.349
The son that you had with Dorothy Graybridge.

26:39.558 --> 26:41.151
He told you that?

26:43.915 --> 26:46.235
He told you he was my son?

26:46.823 --> 26:47.653
No.

26:48.175 --> 26:53.229
In fact, it was clear to me that he has no idea that you are his father.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.594
The doctor said that she died peacefully yesterday morning.

27:03.672 --> 27:05.355
Although I'm not so sure.

27:07.611 --> 27:10.069
You didn't kill your wife, did you?

27:13.151 --> 27:16.018
I didn't even know Dorothy had a gun.

27:18.145 --> 27:21.529
I had no idea that was in the cards.

27:23.524 --> 27:27.886
All I knew was that she was pregnant, and we were in love...

27:28.731 --> 27:31.552
and she was determined to tell Abigail.

27:34.399 --> 27:37.476
Okay, come on, let's get this over with.

27:37.593 --> 27:39.939
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

27:40.021 --> 27:42.284
Well, then I'll just have to do it myself.

28:43.849 --> 28:44.927
Oh, my...

28:45.471 --> 28:47.110
I-I-I didn't do this.

28:47.211 --> 28:48.619
It's not what you think.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.621
What?

28:57.063 --> 29:00.180
I know it looks crazy. It is crazy, but...

29:02.551 --> 29:03.554
You believe me...

29:04.614 --> 29:05.566
don't you?

29:12.611 --> 29:14.537
Let's not worry about what I believe.

29:20.277 --> 29:22.693
Let's worry about what the police are going to believe.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.237
What are you doing?

29:25.591 --> 29:27.219
Why are you doing that?

29:28.565 --> 29:29.687
Get out of here, Dorothy.

29:30.501 --> 29:31.530
Go somewhere.

29:32.237 --> 29:33.404
Have our baby.

29:33.978 --> 29:36.086
What... what about us?

29:36.247 --> 29:37.510
What about our future?

29:37.864 --> 29:39.830
I'm taking care of our future.

29:45.011 --> 29:46.865
I'm going to call the police and confess.

29:49.143 --> 29:50.714
You just promise me one thing.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.159
You'll never tell our child about any of this.

29:55.943 --> 29:58.052
You'll never tell our child about me...

29:59.813 --> 30:01.093
or any of this.

30:08.226 --> 30:09.644
"Just promise me...

30:10.863 --> 30:14.371
that you'll never tell our child about me,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.474
or any of this.

30:19.106 --> 30:21.026
Just promise me."

30:21.533 --> 30:23.147
So you took the blame.

30:24.799 --> 30:28.890
The only honorable thing I've done in my entire life.

30:29.964 --> 30:33.618
Please, I beg you--

30:35.112 --> 30:37.379
don't take that away from me now.

30:47.266 --> 30:48.393
I know you.

30:48.707 --> 30:51.997
I'm not sure that's necessarily something you want to brag about.

30:52.115 --> 30:53.769
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.686
For what it's worth, you sound better.

30:57.931 --> 30:59.841
I mean, I don't hear your cold anymore.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.328
Yes, I seem to have stumbled upon an amazing cure.

31:03.497 --> 31:06.768
First, you have to investigate a murder that no one cares about,

31:06.912 --> 31:11.485
but you got to be sure to arrive just as the guilty party dies.

31:11.586 --> 31:16.454
And yet, still in time for the falsely imprisoned to tell you to leave them the hell alone.

31:17.204 --> 31:18.991
Hey, whatever it takes.

31:21.553 --> 31:22.436
I missed you.

31:23.531 --> 31:24.457
I missed you.

31:25.401 --> 31:26.768
Dorothy Graybridge...

31:28.596 --> 31:30.146
She was in a coma.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.626
I'm guessing she knew she was close to death.

31:34.719 --> 31:40.781
And every day the people at the nursing home would turn on the show and play it in her room.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.773
She must have carried that guilty secret her whole life.

31:47.385 --> 31:52.464
Hearing the show brought back memories, and me with my crazy thought antenna.

31:53.285 --> 31:56.510
You must have just snatched it out of the air every day.

31:57.456 --> 31:58.983
You were watching the show,

31:59.392 --> 32:01.129
she was hearing the show.

32:05.004 --> 32:08.220
I knew what everybody looked like except Dorothy,

32:08.318 --> 32:10.483
so I made Dorothy look like me.

32:14.769 --> 32:16.418
So what was the point?

32:17.917 --> 32:18.860
What do you mean?

32:19.597 --> 32:21.481
There has to be a point.

32:21.568 --> 32:24.471
Whenever I see these things, it's for a reason.

32:25.579 --> 32:26.944
But this time?

32:28.236 --> 32:30.897
Hey, you got me.

32:33.944 --> 32:35.244
You can't prove he's innocent.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.697
And even if you could, he doesn't want you to.

32:38.664 --> 32:40.651
Maybe it's what you said last week.

32:41.444 --> 32:42.765
Maybe it's just a dream...

32:43.744 --> 32:44.670
a nightmare.

32:45.535 --> 32:47.624
It came to you for no particular reason at all.

33:47.577 --> 33:49.019
Don't do that.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.309
I like that light.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.225
The sound is hideous.

33:53.315 --> 33:56.176
You keep that off, but I like that light,

33:56.417 --> 33:57.851
that white light.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.324
Switch it back on, would you?

34:05.924 --> 34:08.992
I heard you talking in the bedroom earlier.

34:10.225 --> 34:12.422
You don't look anything like her, by the way.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.623
Dorothy?

34:15.730 --> 34:17.174
The woman who murdered you?

34:17.777 --> 34:21.889
Dorothy committed any number of sins, but murder wasn't one of them.

34:22.447 --> 34:25.243
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

34:25.351 --> 34:29.641
I didn't really ask Dorothy to come over to the house that night to run lines with me.

34:31.074 --> 34:32.800
Look at the television.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.190
Mrs. Marsh? It's Dorothy.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.436
Mrs. Marsh?

34:56.655 --> 34:57.776
Come in, Dorothy.

35:01.953 --> 35:03.797
I'm sorry I didn't get up to let you in.

35:03.883 --> 35:06.305
I guess I'm still not feeling a hundred percent.

35:08.185 --> 35:11.041
Mrs. Marsh, there's something I need to talk to you about.

35:11.133 --> 35:11.870
Oh?

35:13.684 --> 35:14.610
I just...

35:15.322 --> 35:20.284
I want you to know that I genuinely appreciate the opportunity

35:20.713 --> 35:25.961
you've given me with this job, but something has happened.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.541
Something I never could have anticipated.

35:28.634 --> 35:29.643
My goodness.

35:29.759 --> 35:35.757
I mean, the last thing in the world I would want to do is hurt you, but,

35:37.283 --> 35:39.340
but you need to know the truth.

35:41.794 --> 35:43.835
The truth is, Henry and I...

35:43.960 --> 35:44.942
Henry?

35:49.081 --> 35:52.525
Henry and I have fallen in love. And...

35:54.153 --> 35:55.330
And?

35:56.805 --> 35:58.930
And we're going to have a baby.

36:02.284 --> 36:03.454
I see.

36:04.997 --> 36:05.708
Well...

36:08.103 --> 36:09.559
Actually, Dorothy,

36:10.517 --> 36:12.845
I have a confession to make--

36:13.967 --> 36:14.992
I knew that.

36:22.969 --> 36:24.735
Are you all right, Dorothy?

36:24.878 --> 36:26.174
Something the matter?

36:27.859 --> 36:29.113
I don't know.

36:30.925 --> 36:32.158
What is that?

36:32.681 --> 36:35.798
That? That's where you shot me, dear.

36:36.510 --> 36:40.234
About three minutes before you got here.

36:40.996 --> 36:43.817
Now you're going to shoot me again.

36:44.160 --> 36:44.943
No!

36:49.056 --> 36:49.947
No!

36:52.214 --> 36:53.279
Henry!

37:01.558 --> 37:02.854
Henry!

37:07.319 --> 37:10.232
I didn't do it. It's not what you think.

37:10.410 --> 37:11.368
Oh, my God.

37:19.443 --> 37:20.589
Wait a second.

37:20.927 --> 37:23.196
So you want me to believe it was you?

37:24.143 --> 37:26.492
That you would do that to yourself?

37:27.512 --> 37:28.673
But why?

37:29.170 --> 37:31.737
Have you ever been in love, Mrs. Dubois?

37:31.977 --> 37:34.255
I am in love, Mrs. Marsh.

37:34.563 --> 37:36.586
But what if you were the only one?

37:37.660 --> 37:39.258
What if you were in love...

37:39.913 --> 37:40.944
alone?

37:42.672 --> 37:45.848
And what if you had lymphoma and nobody knew about it?

37:45.915 --> 37:47.471
Not even your husband?

37:49.432 --> 37:51.879
I'd been seeing a doctor in Nevada.

37:52.518 --> 37:54.398
I didn't want anyone to know.

37:54.874 --> 37:57.418
Not the studios, not the network.

37:58.115 --> 38:00.177
There was no treatment for it...

38:00.680 --> 38:01.934
back then.

38:04.413 --> 38:09.342
Finally, the tests came back. He gave me three months.

38:11.479 --> 38:13.321
Three short months.

38:14.939 --> 38:16.998
And I wanted to tell Henry.

38:17.992 --> 38:20.438
I was planning on it. I was.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.770
But then when I found out about him and Dorothy...

38:26.331 --> 38:28.165
found out about the baby...

38:31.329 --> 38:34.989
I need you to do something for me, Mrs. Dubois.

38:39.126 --> 38:41.261
Hey, what's going on?

38:42.275 --> 38:44.635
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

38:45.911 --> 38:48.840
I... I think I have to go back to California tomorrow.

38:56.391 --> 38:58.792
What am I looking at here, young lady?

38:58.978 --> 39:00.861
Why are you here again?!

39:02.243 --> 39:04.634
Those are your wife's medical records.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.405
She was dying of a terminal illness.

39:08.773 --> 39:09.800
And this...

39:10.758 --> 39:14.543
is a receipt for a gun that she purchased two days before her death.

39:20.778 --> 39:22.433
Oh, my God...

39:25.124 --> 39:26.947
I had no idea.

39:28.674 --> 39:30.368
How did you find this?

39:31.802 --> 39:36.180
A friend of the family's pointed me towards a safety deposit box in Nevada.

39:36.456 --> 39:37.576
The point is...

39:38.294 --> 39:42.672
with this information, I'm fairly certain that we could reopen your case.

39:42.764 --> 39:45.560
If we can demonstrate that Abigail took her own life

39:45.662 --> 39:49.281
and if you're willing to recant your confession, you could go free.

39:50.598 --> 39:52.492
I'm an old man.

39:54.255 --> 39:56.609
What does it matter now?

39:56.900 --> 39:58.980
It may not matter to you,

39:59.393 --> 40:03.966
but I asked someone to come here with me to whom it will matter a great deal.

40:46.365 --> 40:47.435
Thank you.

40:52.043 --> 40:53.099
Dorothy?

40:53.979 --> 40:54.879
Ma'am?

40:55.442 --> 40:57.798
We can't have you loitering in the hallway.

40:58.233 --> 41:00.086
I-I was just talking to...

41:03.840 --> 41:04.793
Ma'am?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
