[the band laughs]

15:16.332 --> 15:17.333
That's funny.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.794
I can't believe how crazy
these kids get over these modern songs.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.004
[chuckles]

15:22.463 --> 15:26.258
We should learn something new.
Maybe Cardi B?

-[member imitates Cardi B] Okurrr.
-[laughs]

15:28.218 --> 15:29.094

[Javier] Twenty-five hundred? Uhh...

15:35.935 --> 15:39.146
My last apartment was only $800,
and that was a two-bedroom.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.899
Even with these new gigs I have,
I can't afford that.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.153
Do you have something
more affordable, like...

15:46.737 --> 15:49.740
for a family that isn't made of money?

15:49.865 --> 15:51.951
[man on phone] This is the cheapest
you're gonna find.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.077
Maybe you should try Azusa.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.286
Azusa?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.539
I-- I can't go to Azusa.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.917
It's just too far for my work.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.171
Do you have something smaller,
like a studio or--

16:04.254 --> 16:07.049
Well I have a studio for $1,400 a month.
That's the best I can do.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.970
Fourteen hundred for a studio?
I'm sorry. It--

You're going rogue, man.

I know you're not happy...
[in Spanish] with the changes.

Smell it, okay? So let's try it again.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.127

Yeah. Shoot.

You're in trouble, man.
That's the one you never forget.

All girls like gifts.

You see that girl over there?

She loves gifts.

Well, I'm babysitting, though, fool.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.953
But you're right. Maybe I should have him
help me do the laundry.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.914
[in Spanish] Seriously?
You're the one who should be working.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.292
Ama, but the murals pay more than enough.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.085
That doesn't mean you have to quit.

Can't they just print more money?
That would fix everything.
