19:15.113 --> 19:18.950
Ah. We feel it is important
to remember the old ways.

19:19.034 --> 19:24.247
We try to honor our ancestors
by keeping traditions from the old land

19:24.373 --> 19:27.250
and by retelling the old stories.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.628
And the new stories.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.672
Yeah! Your stories.

Please, if there is any way
we can help you, just ask.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.195
Well, I wanted to ask
