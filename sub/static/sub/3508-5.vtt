You are so not going
to believe this.

00:29.233 --> 00:29.934
What are you doing here?

00:30.034 --> 00:31.767
- I can't even believe it.
- Believe what?

00:31.801 --> 00:32.600
I can't tell you.

00:32.801 --> 00:34.501
I'm still asleep, aren't I?
I'm dreaming.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.701
I'm having a dream where
my book agent has shown up

00:36.702 --> 00:40.102
At my house at 7:00 A.M.
to not tell me something.

00:40.634 --> 00:41.167
Okay.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.701
It's not official yet,

00:43.734 --> 00:45.700
But... you, my dear,

00:46.400 --> 00:48.067
are at the top of their list,

00:48.668 --> 00:50.467
and I can't give you
any more details than that.

00:50.667 --> 00:51.768
You want some coffee?

00:51.801 --> 00:53.900
I'd love to sit down
and not discuss this further.

00:53.901 --> 00:54.901
I will tell you this--

00:55.334 --> 00:57.334
It's a major relaunch
of a major franchise--

00:57.467 --> 01:00.733
A 3-Book deal--
And they want you.

01:01.267 --> 01:02.533
"Heat Wave" comes out
in less than a week.

01:03.134 --> 01:05.367
The book party, which you
arranged, is Monday night.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.201
I'm trying to launch
my own character.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.701
Why would I want to get involved
with somebody else's?

01:08.767 --> 01:10.834
What if I told you
the character in question

01:11.034 --> 01:14.200
is a certain British
Secret Agent?

01:15.234 --> 01:16.167
You mean it's gonna be--

01:16.268 --> 01:18.568
Shh. Don't say it.
You'll jinx it.

01:18.833 --> 01:20.034
He's the reason
I became a writer.
(Cell phone ringing)

01:20.300 --> 01:20.733
I know.

01:20.734 --> 01:22.434
I mean,
he's the coolest spy ever.

01:22.467 --> 01:23.300
- Right.
- He's got gadgets,

01:23.301 --> 01:24.701
he's got babes, he's--

01:24.733 --> 01:26.967
And a payday
that is unbelievable.

01:26.968 --> 01:28.268
And they want me
for three new books?

01:28.300 --> 01:29.233
(Ringing continues)
Yes, now are you gonna get that?

01:29.301 --> 01:31.234
Because an unanswered phone
gives me agita.

01:32.535 --> 01:33.335
It's Beckett.

01:34.134 --> 01:35.433
(Ring)
A body must have dropped.

01:35.601 --> 01:36.868
Uh...

01:38.567 --> 01:39.401
I'll call her back.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.134
What other details can't you tell me?
(Chuckles)

01:42.534 --> 01:45.233
(Siren whoops)
Morning, gentlemen.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.200
So what do you got for us?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.301
Caucasian female, early 30s,

01:49.634 --> 01:51.301
No purse or I.D.
found on the body.

01:51.334 --> 01:52.300
Where is she?

01:53.833 --> 01:54.767
City workers found her

01:54.800 --> 01:56.601
When they opened the manhole
to check the line.

01:56.934 --> 01:57.501
(Police radio chatter)

02:04.700 --> 02:06.133
Something tells me
she didn't trip.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.234
Cause of death appears to be
blunt force trauma.

02:10.967 --> 02:13.134
She took a nasty blow
to the back of the head.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.034
But we found traces of blood spatter
over there on the sidewalk.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.701
Well, then it couldn't
have been a robbery.

02:17.901 --> 02:19.767
A mugger wouldn't bother
dragging her body that far

02:19.768 --> 02:20.468
just to hide it.

02:20.568 --> 02:22.434
Given the amount of decomposition,

02:23.101 --> 02:24.734
I'd say she was killed
about two days ago.

02:24.767 --> 02:26.601
Any chance you could
narrow that down for us?

02:26.634 --> 02:28.400
Any chance I can get her
to the lab first?

02:30.034 --> 02:31.300
I should be able to get you
a tighter window,

02:31.334 --> 02:33.300
maybe down to six or seven hours.

02:33.601 --> 02:34.901
All right, thank you.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.101
(Ryan)
Ah, good morning.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.234
Look who decided
to grace us with his presence.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.933
Did you have something
more important to do, Castle?

02:41.934 --> 02:43.034
I got held up at home.

02:43.234 --> 02:44.100
Was that the body?

02:44.201 --> 02:45.401
Yeah, it's on its way
to the morgue.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.168
- Aw.
- What, you wanted us to wait?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.601
Yeah, it's too bad, too.
It's your kinda case, bro.

02:50.902 --> 02:51.502
Yeah?

02:51.534 --> 02:55.167
Yeah, body was found down that
manhole over there, half eaten.

02:55.368 --> 02:56.168
Eaten?

02:56.169 --> 02:57.869
Yeah, it was covered
in some kind of green slime.

02:58.334 --> 03:00.167
- Whoa.
- Yeah, it was creepy.

03:00.601 --> 03:02.801
It's as if someone
or something is down there.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.767
Ah, that's--Okay,
very funny. That's great.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.001
Was there a body
down the manhole?

03:08.202 --> 03:10.102
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you. An adult.

03:10.467 --> 03:11.734
Yeah, you shoulda seen
what else was down there.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.233
Two metal canisters
with biohazard stickers

03:14.268 --> 03:15.600
and yellow powder inside of it.

03:15.601 --> 03:16.701
You opened the...

03:18.034 --> 03:19.434
All right. Tha--will someone
please tell me

03:19.467 --> 03:20.668
what's really going on here?

03:20.869 --> 03:22.469
We're gonna check nearby trash
cans for the murder weapon.

03:22.768 --> 03:24.500
Uh, what was the murder weapon,
by the way?

03:24.501 --> 03:25.701
Some kind of death ray.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.167
Turns your insides out.

03:30.568 --> 03:32.068
(Perlmutter) Her fingerprints
came back negative.

03:32.069 --> 03:33.169
(Camera beeps, shutter clicks)

03:33.170 --> 03:35.470
Missing persons didn't have
anyone matching her description.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.334
(Camera shutter clicks)

03:38.035 --> 03:39.835
Your boys didn't happen to find
her purse by any chance?

03:40.201 --> 03:42.267
No, no purse,
no murder weapon.

03:42.368 --> 03:44.267
Then we have ourselves
a Jane Doe.

03:44.934 --> 03:47.634
Two days and no one steps
forward to say she's missing.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.300
Which means she probably
lived alone

03:49.434 --> 03:52.067
and she didn't have a job
where she needed to be.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.668
I can tell you this much--
She's an immigrant,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.301
Probably from Eastern Europe.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.102
Her dental work?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.203
Yeah, she's got a couple
of stainless steel crowns.

03:58.401 --> 03:59.733
We don't use 'em anymore
in the states,

03:59.734 --> 04:02.034
But they're still common
in the former Soviet Block.

04:02.634 --> 04:05.733
Uh, we found this scrunched in
the bottom of her pants pocket.

04:06.034 --> 04:06.834
Candy wrapper.

04:07.701 --> 04:09.334
It's got some kind of writing on it.

04:09.401 --> 04:11.400
The lettering has
diacritical marks on it.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.001
They're accent marks
used to represent sounds

04:14.034 --> 04:14.767
That are alien to latin.

04:14.834 --> 04:18.034
I'm gonna go with
Slavic Cyrillic. No, Czech.

04:18.567 --> 04:19.500
And you know this how?

04:19.701 --> 04:21.401
I almost ordered
a Russian bride once.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.600
You know, a Czech mate?

04:25.067 --> 04:25.833
I'm gonna run this down.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.100
There can't be
too many shops in the area

04:27.167 --> 04:28.134
That sell this stuff.

04:31.035 --> 04:31.735
Hey, Perlmutter.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.467
I'm having a book launch party
Monday night. You wanna come?

04:34.068 --> 04:34.868
Please.

04:35.267 --> 04:36.200
I'll put you down as a maybe.

04:40.033 --> 04:41.301
(Castle) This is gonna
weird you out a little bit,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.167
But check this out.
I mean, it just seems like...

04:43.401 --> 04:45.567
It seems to bend
the space time continuum.

04:45.601 --> 04:47.200
Look, just when you think
there can't be another one.

04:48.201 --> 04:48.201
Wow
What is he doing?

04:48.234 --> 04:49.767
We hit about a dozen little shops

04:49.834 --> 04:51.300
Trying to find
that candy wrapper.
(Castle speaks indistinctly)

04:51.367 --> 04:54.534
And he insisted on
buying something in every shop.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.535
(laughs)
In every shop?

04:57.033 --> 04:58.100
No wrapper, though.

04:58.101 --> 04:59.601
Something tells me,
if he decides to put

04:59.634 --> 05:01.134
the great candy wrapper hunt
in his next book,

05:01.167 --> 05:02.367
He'll give it a happier ending.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.768
Wait, sir. Sir, uh, next book?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.400
Is he writing
another Nikki Heat novel?

05:08.434 --> 05:09.434
The deal was for one book.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.435
- I assumed that--
- You were off the hook?

05:11.734 --> 05:13.200
You know how the Mayor feels
about Castle.

05:13.234 --> 05:14.734
<i>If the man is gonna write
another book about you--</i>

05:14.735 --> 05:17.135
I am not Nikki Heat, sir.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.200
Yeah. Well, uh, hizzoner expects
your cooperation either way.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.868
(Elevator bell dings)

05:24.901 --> 05:26.733
(Ryan)
Yo! Found your candy.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.601
You found it?
Get outta town.

05:28.867 --> 05:31.234
- Little grocery on 47th and 9th.
- Yep.

05:31.867 --> 05:33.301
I told you we shoulda
checked the West End.

05:33.802 --> 05:35.302
(Ryan) Owner recognized
our vic's picture.

05:35.801 --> 05:37.534
Said she'd come by
every couple of weeks

05:37.535 --> 05:38.935
and stock up on stuff
from back home.

05:38.936 --> 05:39.736
(Castle)
Hmm.

05:39.934 --> 05:42.433
Kinda tastes like soap.
I like it.

05:43.567 --> 05:44.501
Did he give you a name?

05:44.602 --> 05:45.502
(Esposito)
No, but he did point us

05:45.533 --> 05:46.667
To where
he thought she might live.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.168
Apparently there's an S.R.O.
Not far from

05:48.169 --> 05:50.569
where we found the body
that caters to Czech illegals.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.401
Well, then let's pay it
a visit.

05:54.234 --> 05:57.400
Yeah, I know her.
The lady in 5-C--Eliska Sokol.

05:58.267 --> 05:59.234
She was a nice person.

06:00.001 --> 06:01.300
She kept to herself, but nice.

06:02.334 --> 06:04.101
Yeah, why anybody'd
want to kill her...

06:04.467 --> 06:05.600
How long did she live
in the building?

06:05.867 --> 06:06.667
About six months.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.368
Never gave you any trouble?

06:08.567 --> 06:10.500
No. I wish all my tenants
were like her.

06:10.501 --> 06:12.534
She paid her rent on time
every week in cash.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.534
- You said 5-C?
- Yeah, you want to see it?

06:15.668 --> 06:18.001
Yeah, please. Why don't you guys
start knocking on doors,

06:18.002 --> 06:20.102
and  see if any of the other
tenants can shed some light.

06:20.234 --> 06:20.701
Right on.

06:25.067 --> 06:25.734
Here it is.

06:25.901 --> 06:27.034
Let me know when you're done.

06:27.068 --> 06:28.033
Thanks.

06:31.200 --> 06:31.967
From what I'm seeing,

06:31.968 --> 06:33.768
it's a pretty good bet
she lived alone.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.601
There's not even
a telephone.

06:39.434 --> 06:41.901
Something tells me
she didn't have many visitors.

06:42.834 --> 06:43.667
Hey.

06:45.334 --> 06:47.400
Work calendar maybe?
Keeping track of shifts.

06:47.634 --> 06:49.501
There's nothing
past last Wednesday.

06:51.433 --> 06:52.434
Postcards from home.

07:00.434 --> 07:01.867
Hmm.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.668
If a picture's worth
a thousand words,

07:12.367 --> 07:14.100
This one says "not a fan."

07:14.467 --> 07:15.967
The scratches
go through the paper.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.167
Whoever she is, looks like
our vic hated her.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.167
Could be the feeling
was mutual.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:32.267 --> 07:33.401
- Want a lollipop?
- Oh, yes.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.468
Tastes like soap.

07:35.769 --> 07:36.469
I'll pass.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.367
Suit yourself.

07:37.768 --> 07:39.668
Oh, dad, Taylor asked
if she could come

07:39.669 --> 07:40.969
to your book launch party
with me.

07:41.301 --> 07:45.068
- Would that be Okay?
-Sure. Hmm. So...

07:45.668 --> 07:47.367
Taylor likes my stuff, huh?

07:47.401 --> 07:48.267
Not that I know of.

07:49.434 --> 07:49.734
Then...

07:49.735 --> 07:52.135
(laughs)
Okay, you are so dense.

07:52.434 --> 07:53.934
She wants to get dressed up,
go to a party, meet boys.

07:55.901 --> 07:57.367
She doesn't care about your little book.

07:57.368 --> 07:58.368
Thanks, dad.

07:59.367 --> 07:59.934
Oh.

08:00.401 --> 08:02.134
(Laughs)
You really are something, you know?

08:02.534 --> 08:04.001
You always think
everything's about you.

08:04.334 --> 08:05.601
- Here.
- What are these?

08:05.801 --> 08:07.701
Oh, they're flyers for my play. I
thought you could hand them out

08:07.734 --> 08:09.734
when you're signing books
at the party tomorrow.

08:09.867 --> 08:12.467
Uh, gee.
I was thinking, actually,

08:12.468 --> 08:15.068
that I might
keep the evening about me.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.801
See if I plug your book
when I'm doing P.R.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.534
Will my career survive?

08:20.534 --> 08:21.733
Boy, you know, ever since

08:21.734 --> 08:23.234
that little visit
from your agent Paula,

08:23.335 --> 08:25.735
You have been
insufferably cocky.

08:26.001 --> 08:28.233
And frankly, I never understood
the appeal of--

08:28.234 --> 08:30.134
Ah, ah, don't say it.
You'll jinx it.

08:30.768 --> 08:32.467
- A certain British spy.
- Thank you.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.101
And I have loved him
since I was a kid.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.501
I know. I know.
It's a big deal.

08:36.534 --> 08:37.168
Mm.

08:37.369 --> 08:38.369
Congratulations.

08:38.433 --> 08:41.034
Well, I haven't got
the official offer yet.

08:41.135 --> 08:44.034
And it would mean not doing
another Nikki Heat book.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.034
Whoa. I know somebody that
you would make very happy.

08:48.001 --> 08:50.001
Beckett. Oh, please.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.200
She'll be thrilled not to have
you following her around.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.368
I'm sure the poor girl
is counting down the days.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.834
Actually, I'd like to think
I've been fairly useful to her,

08:57.835 --> 08:58.635
Solving cases-wise.

08:58.736 --> 08:59.836
Oh, please.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.901
I'm sure she got along fine
before you arrived.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.034
K-O-L. Sokol.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.134
No, she doesn't have
a social security number.

09:12.167 --> 09:13.201
She's illegal.

09:13.434 --> 09:15.333
All right,
notify all precincts,

09:15.401 --> 09:16.467
including the Boroughs.

09:17.467 --> 09:18.234
Thank you.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.100
So I did a records check
on Eliska Sokol.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.701
She didn't have any run-ins
with law enforcement.

09:24.702 --> 09:26.702
So I asked Central to put
her name out on the blotter.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.467
You never know.
It might turn something up.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.968
You know, I was thinking

09:29.969 --> 09:32.169
about how to track down
this mystery woman.

09:33.067 --> 09:35.001
I bet you Parks and Recreation
would be able to tell us

09:35.002 --> 09:36.702
on which playground
this photo was taken.

09:36.703 --> 09:38.103
You see how there's sand
at the bottom?

09:38.301 --> 09:40.001
A lot of playgrounds
have wood chips

09:40.002 --> 09:43.102
or this green spongy stuff
that used to freak Alexis out.

09:43.103 --> 09:44.303
And there's also
a climbing wall feature

09:44.334 --> 09:48.534
In the back here that's not
a... "75th and Lexington."

09:50.100 --> 09:51.000
Oh.

09:51.934 --> 09:53.401
Great minds think alike,
I guess.

09:53.434 --> 09:55.301
Next thing you're gonna do
is tell me that I should

09:55.302 --> 09:56.702
go down there with a photograph.

09:57.103 --> 09:58.803
Wouldn't be a horrible idea.

09:58.804 --> 10:01.904
(Cell phone rings)
Oh, look. Esposito's calling.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.500
<i>Wonder what he and Ryan
have been doing all morning.</i>

10:05.167 --> 10:05.400
(Beep)

10:06.700 --> 10:07.968
Hello.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.033
No, it's just Castle.

10:10.734 --> 10:11.534
(Esposito)
Lady on the playground

10:11.567 --> 10:13.100
said she recognized the kid
in the photo.

10:13.167 --> 10:13.933
Said she was pretty sure

10:14.100 --> 10:15.667
That the family
lived in this building.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.801
Uh, just hold on a second.
Can I help you?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.934
I'm detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.034
We were wondering
if you recognized

10:24.067 --> 10:25.534
Anyone in this photograph.

10:26.034 --> 10:29.067
That's Zane Talbot
and his mother.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.634
Were they tenants here?

10:31.434 --> 10:32.767
Can I ask
what this is about?

10:33.567 --> 10:34.667
We're conducting an investigation

10:34.768 --> 10:37.068
into the murder of a woman
named Eliska Sokol.

10:37.334 --> 10:39.734
Eliska? She's dead?

10:40.267 --> 10:40.901
You know her?

10:41.102 --> 10:43.602
She worked here until
just a few days ago.

10:43.933 --> 10:44.667
In what capacity?

10:45.301 --> 10:47.067
She started off
in the laundry room.

10:47.101 --> 10:49.567
A few weeks ago, we promoted her
to client services.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.567
This is a Concierge building.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.068
We have a staff of over 75
providing our tenants

10:54.069 --> 10:55.469
With round-the-clock attention.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.167
Like living in a fancy hotel.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.634
Do you have any idea
why Eliska left her job?

11:00.900 --> 11:04.100
She didn't. She was let go.

11:04.501 --> 11:06.700
There was an incident
with one of the tenants--

11:07.167 --> 11:08.934
Mrs. Talbot, actually.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.134
Poor woman. Do you have
any idea killed her?

11:13.267 --> 11:15.767
We're working on it.
The manager said

11:15.768 --> 11:17.268
that there was
some sort of an incident.

11:17.869 --> 11:19.269
I suppose
you could call it that.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.470
Really, I think the whole thing's

11:20.471 --> 11:21.971
Gotten blown way out of proportion.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.434
Could you tell us what happened?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.968
It was last Wednesday, I think.

11:26.969 --> 11:28.969
And I was with Zane in his room.
(Speaking inaudibly)

11:29.200 --> 11:31.901
She came in to change
the towels in his bathroom.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.600
I got up to go answer the phone.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.601
When I came back,
the door was closed.

11:36.334 --> 11:39.467
I go in, and she's sitting on
the floor, playing, I suppose,

11:39.534 --> 11:42.500
But I couldn't really tell
because all I could think was,

11:43.167 --> 11:45.501
He's got a lollipop
in his mouth.

11:46.668 --> 11:47.934
She'd given him a lollipop.

11:48.135 --> 11:49.535
You just don't do that.

11:49.536 --> 11:53.136
You don't give someone else's
child candy without permission.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.667
They could be allergic
or diabetic.

11:55.534 --> 11:57.267
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.

11:57.268 --> 11:58.968
(Man) You have to understand,
we hardly knew this woman.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.034
It--It wasn't like
she was our housekeeper

12:01.067 --> 12:01.933
that we saw every day.

12:02.134 --> 12:03.034
I didn't say anything,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.768
But I think she sensed
that I was unhappy,

12:05.801 --> 12:07.800
because she got very flustered
and couldn't get out of there

12:07.900 --> 12:08.767
fast enough.

12:09.734 --> 12:12.301
Zane seemed to be fine,
so I decided to let it go.

12:12.302 --> 12:13.902
But then the more
that I thought about it,

12:13.903 --> 12:17.203
the more I realized that
that was not the first time

12:17.204 --> 12:21.704
that she had seemed
overly familiar with him.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.868
Overly familiar?

12:25.567 --> 12:27.634
Giving him more attention
than seemed appropriate.

12:27.635 --> 12:29.535
Did you ever think
it might have been cultural,

12:29.536 --> 12:31.536
That...
that might be the way

12:31.537 --> 12:33.737
that people are
with children in her country?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.934
Of course. All I did
was mention to the manager

12:36.935 --> 12:38.735
that maybe somebody would want
to talk to her

12:38.801 --> 12:40.634
You know,
about what's appropriate.

12:41.301 --> 12:43.201
I didn't even know
that she had been fired

12:43.234 --> 12:45.367
until you told us.
And now she's...

12:46.200 --> 12:47.667
I-I mean, I feel horrible.

12:47.668 --> 12:49.568
I really do.
(Pager beeps)

12:49.569 --> 12:51.569
I'm sorry. I'm on call.
(Beep)

12:52.401 --> 12:53.234
(Sighs)
Unless there's something else?

12:53.268 --> 12:55.634
No. No. I think we have
everything we need.

12:56.301 --> 12:59.968
Um... you don't suppose
that her being let go

12:59.969 --> 13:03.969
has anything to do with
what happened to her, do you?

13:04.301 --> 13:05.767
We can't rule anything out.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.367
It's possible that she was
hard-pressed for money

13:08.368 --> 13:10.268
And she got into something
that she shouldn't have.

13:10.269 --> 13:11.369
Then it's my fault.

13:12.001 --> 13:15.400
No, Mrs. Talbot, it's the fault
of the person who killed her.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.500
Thank you for your time.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.434
That's pretty nice of you, letting her
off the hook like that.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.767
It's pretty obvious Eliska
blames her for losing her job.

13:22.768 --> 13:23.868
Maybe so.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.369
And maybe being let go somehow
led to her being killed,

13:26.370 --> 13:28.170
but making that woman
feel any worse

13:28.171 --> 13:29.771
won't get us closer
to solving the crime.

13:29.772 --> 13:30.672
Hey, got anything?

13:30.873 --> 13:32.073
Just that our vic
used to be married.

13:32.601 --> 13:34.034
Housekeeper I was talking to
said that Eliska

13:34.035 --> 13:35.935
mentioned it to her once.
Ryan's running it.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.700
His name is Teodor Hajek.
Records check came up with

13:39.701 --> 13:41.834
A domestic disturbance call
from two years ago.

13:42.635 --> 13:43.635
Abusive ex-Husband.

13:43.636 --> 13:45.536
Maybe he came back
for an encore performance.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.101
(Beckett) NYPD.

13:49.168 --> 13:50.768
We're looking for Teodor Hajek.

13:51.668 --> 13:52.467
Back there, ma'am.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.067
Thank you.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.068
Teodor Hajek?

13:59.733 --> 14:00.367
Yes?

14:00.567 --> 14:01.433
Would you step around, please?

14:01.434 --> 14:02.634
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

14:05.434 --> 14:06.301
Thank you.

14:07.902 --> 14:08.602
[ door bangs open ]

14:11.067 --> 14:11.567
(Man grunts and screams)

14:12.567 --> 14:13.867
Oh. Oh.
Sorry.

14:15.267 --> 14:16.201
(Beckett)
Ryan, cut him off.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.034
(Objects clattering)

14:18.800 --> 14:19.334
(Grunts)

14:19.934 --> 14:21.101
(Grunts)

14:29.201 --> 14:30.367
(Grunts)

14:30.467 --> 14:32.434
(Esposito) Stop him.
Stop right there. Come here.

14:34.533 --> 14:35.434
(Grunts)

14:35.534 --> 14:36.434
(Groans)
On your stomach.

14:36.534 --> 14:37.968
(Ryan) Stay down, buddy.
Let's go. Roll over.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.067
Teodor Hajek...
you're under arrest.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.367
Mr. Hajek, you've been
advised of your rights?

14:47.433 --> 14:48.067
Yes.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.034
And you declined an attorney?

14:50.534 --> 14:53.400
For what? You're going to
deport me either way, yes?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.067
Mr. Hajek,
we're not from immigration.

14:57.834 --> 14:58.800
Is that why you ran?

14:59.334 --> 15:01.034
My visa is expired
many years before.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.534
Well, we're not interested
in your immigration status.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.501
I'm a homicide detective.

15:05.002 --> 15:05.802
Homicide?

15:06.201 --> 15:08.200
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your ex-wife.

15:08.634 --> 15:11.968
Eliska? Yes.
What happened? Tell me.

15:11.969 --> 15:13.569
She was killed
three nights ago.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.900
(Speaks foreign language)
Eliska.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.067
Where were you on Thursday
between 5:00 and 9:00 P.M.?

15:27.800 --> 15:28.767
I was home asleep.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.634
I work double shift
and was tired.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.833
Can anyone verify that?

15:35.467 --> 15:37.567
Maybe neighbors saw.
I don't know.

15:38.201 --> 15:39.967
We have a domestic disturbance
complaint

15:39.968 --> 15:41.868
from two years ago
involving you and your wife.

15:41.869 --> 15:43.169
Would you mind telling us
about that?

15:44.034 --> 15:46.868
We were arguing.
Neighbors called police.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.267
What did you argue about?

15:49.967 --> 15:53.367
She wanted to leave me.
I didn't want her to go.

15:53.634 --> 15:54.867
Why did she want to leave?

15:55.434 --> 15:56.734
She said to be with me...

15:58.335 --> 15:59.635
hurt her.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.334
Because, uh, too much
I remind her of Martin,

16:04.801 --> 16:06.034
Our son.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.500
God took him from us
three years ago.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.200
I'm very sorry to hear that.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.300
It tore her heart away.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.568
He was everything to her.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.968
He was so perfect
when he was born.

16:20.934 --> 16:23.034
But the sickness was in him
even then.

16:23.301 --> 16:24.934
There was nothing we could do

16:26.734 --> 16:27.833
Except, uh...

16:30.267 --> 16:31.534
Watch him...

16:33.201 --> 16:34.734
Waste away and...

16:36.367 --> 16:37.201
Away.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.467
This was my family.

16:51.334 --> 16:52.634
We were happy once.

16:55.334 --> 16:56.900
Now they're gone from me.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.367
Both of them...

17:00.834 --> 17:01.700
Gone.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.367
Kind of puts
a whole new perspective

17:11.367 --> 17:12.568
on the Talbot incident.

17:13.767 --> 17:14.468
Thank you.

17:14.469 --> 17:17.469
Well, he probably reminded
Eliska of her own little boy.

17:17.534 --> 17:18.601
She was trying
to be nice to him,

17:18.666 --> 17:20.900
And next thing you know,
she's out of a job.

17:21.401 --> 17:22.401
Yo.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.634
Ex-Husband's alibi
checks out.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.534
Neighbor remembers seeing him
come home around 5:00.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.767
Well, no surprises there.
He was never our guy.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.201
(Beckett) Okay, guys, let's put
ourselves in Eliska's shoes.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.933
She's suddenly unemployed,
she's worried about making rent.

17:33.934 --> 17:35.734
What kind of trouble
can she get herself into?

17:35.801 --> 17:37.701
The usual suspects are kinda
hard to see with her--

17:38.234 --> 17:39.501
Drugs, prostitution.

17:39.702 --> 17:41.602
Okay, well, there's gotta be
something else then.

17:42.701 --> 17:44.068
You know what?
Let's go back to the building,

17:44.167 --> 17:46.067
See if there's anyone we missed
on the first canvass.

17:46.068 --> 17:47.468
Someone must have seen
or heard something.

17:50.267 --> 17:51.533
Thank you so much for your time.

17:51.534 --> 17:52.734
If you can think of anything else,

17:52.735 --> 17:54.135
Please don't hesitate to call.

17:56.401 --> 17:57.467
Well, that's everybody
on our list.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.934
Let's hope Ryan and Esposito
are having better luck upstairs.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.867
Can I ask you a question,
Castle?

18:01.868 --> 18:02.568
I already know
what you're going to ask.

18:02.569 --> 18:04.469
The dress code for the party
is evening cocktail.

18:04.601 --> 18:06.034
If you're stumped,
just ask yourself,

18:06.134 --> 18:07.300
What would Nikki Heat wear?

18:07.301 --> 18:09.001
When were you gonna tell me
about the other book?

18:10.000 --> 18:10.967
You heard about that?

18:11.468 --> 18:12.668
So it's true?

18:13.167 --> 18:14.367
Well, it's not a done deal yet.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.334
Well, did it ever occur to you
to talk to me first?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.267
Well, frankly, I thought
you'd be relieved.

18:20.268 --> 18:21.368
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

18:21.369 --> 18:23.069
Well, I mean, I'm flattered
to even be considered.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.070
Writing a certain
British Secret Agent would be

18:25.071 --> 18:26.471
a very big opportunity for me.

18:26.534 --> 18:27.701
I was talking about Nikki Heat.

18:28.402 --> 18:29.102
Oh.

18:29.501 --> 18:31.400
Wait a minute. A certain
British Secret Agent? Are you--

18:31.500 --> 18:34.101
If they actually offer it
to me. They may not.

18:34.501 --> 18:35.434
Yeah, but if they do?

18:36.134 --> 18:38.668
Well, I-I would certainly
consider it.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.533
Like I said,
I thought you'd be relieved.

18:41.401 --> 18:42.268
I am.

18:42.334 --> 18:44.968
I mean, I would be,
if they offered it to you.

18:45.568 --> 18:47.367
(Ryan) You sure we talked
to 4-E last time?

18:47.868 --> 18:48.868
(Esposito)
What, the robe lady?

18:49.201 --> 18:50.634
Yeah, she, uh, didn't know
our vic, but wanted us

18:50.635 --> 18:51.735
to help her with the ghost
in her apartment.

18:51.834 --> 18:52.567
Oh, yeah.

18:52.634 --> 18:53.601
You guys a bust, too?

18:53.602 --> 18:55.702
Yeah, we talked to everybody
that wasn't home last time.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.434
Nothing.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.635
Well, that's it then. We hit
everybody in the building.

18:58.700 --> 18:59.434
(Ryan) Yep.

19:00.901 --> 19:01.334
(Castle) Sorry.
Excuse me.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.401
(Ryan) Pardon us.
(Beckett) Sorry.

19:06.101 --> 19:06.700
Did you...

19:07.634 --> 19:09.034
- Did you?
- It was--

19:09.168 --> 19:09.968
Miss!

19:10.868 --> 19:12.567
(Beckett) She was out of town
for our first canvass,

19:12.700 --> 19:15.101
But the night of the vic's
murder, she remembers seeing her

19:15.102 --> 19:16.402
Arguing with a man
in the hallway.

19:16.701 --> 19:17.800
Well-Dressed, mid-40s.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.567
Doesn't exactly narrow things down.

19:19.568 --> 19:21.368
No, but the pager
on his belt does.

19:23.633 --> 19:24.367
Beckett.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.134
What do you think, Castle?

19:27.668 --> 19:29.701
Look like someone we know?

19:30.067 --> 19:31.301
Paging Dr. Talbot.

19:33.934 --> 19:35.201
I admit, there's a similarity.

19:35.602 --> 19:37.402
But... it wasn't me.

19:38.703 --> 19:39.503
Do you really want us

19:39.504 --> 19:41.304
to pull you out of here
and put you in a lineup?

19:41.305 --> 19:42.905
Because that's exactly
where this is headed.

19:42.906 --> 19:45.406
Okay, this is insane.
I hardly knew the woman.

19:45.407 --> 19:46.807
We did some checking,
Dr. Talbot.

19:46.808 --> 19:48.308
Before she worked
in your apartment,

19:48.309 --> 19:49.509
she also
worked at Bryant General.

19:49.510 --> 19:50.910
That's where you see
your patients, isn't it?

19:51.111 --> 19:53.011
What exactly was the nature
of your relationship

19:53.034 --> 19:53.667
with this woman?

19:53.668 --> 19:54.568
There was no relationship.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.301
All right. We're outta here.

19:56.302 --> 19:57.502
You're coming with us
to the precinct.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.700
You meet a nice class
of people in a lineup.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.834
- You'll be surprised.
- Okay, wait.

20:03.533 --> 20:04.601
There was a relationship.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.633
Eliska and I...
we were having an affair.

20:14.601 --> 20:16.400
We met when she was
working at the hospital.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.834
I was there late one night,
and we got to talking.

20:20.534 --> 20:22.567
Anyway, we crossed paths
a couple of times after that,

20:22.667 --> 20:25.700
And... one thing
led to another.

20:27.734 --> 20:29.801
(Sighs) God,
this is humiliating.

20:30.401 --> 20:31.934
What happened when she
found out you were married?

20:32.867 --> 20:33.734
Well, she was upset.

20:36.234 --> 20:38.733
But I convinced her
that I just needed some time

20:38.734 --> 20:41.134
to figure out how to
end things with Melissa.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.267
Which you never
intended to do.

20:43.734 --> 20:46.667
And it was good for a while,
but she was losing patience,

20:46.834 --> 20:50.401
And then she even started paying
special attention to Zane,

20:50.934 --> 20:52.368
as if she was almost...

20:52.468 --> 20:54.200
Getting ready to become
a part of his life,

20:54.267 --> 20:55.500
and it was just impossible.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.934
Well, then why didn't you
just break up with her?

20:58.100 --> 20:59.667
I tried.
She just wouldn't let go.

21:01.034 --> 21:03.634
And then that day
with my wife and the candy,

21:03.701 --> 21:04.601
that was the last straw.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.367
Truth is... it was a relief
when she got fired.

21:11.068 --> 21:11.800
And so I did,

21:11.801 --> 21:14.101
I went to see her the next day
to give her money,

21:14.167 --> 21:16.901
and then she started
screaming at me, and,

21:17.334 --> 21:19.167
I mean, there's nothing for me
to do but to leave,

21:19.201 --> 21:21.401
to turn around and walk away.

21:25.101 --> 21:28.067
Where were you on Thursday
between 5:00 and 9:00 P.M.?

21:29.034 --> 21:31.501
I was here at the office,
and I worked late that day.

21:32.134 --> 21:33.000
(Knock on door)

21:34.567 --> 21:37.401
Excuse me, Doctor, but your wife
and son just arrived.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.934
You were supposed
to have lunch today.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.834
Right. Of--Of course. Can you
just give me one more second?

21:43.000 --> 21:43.734
Of course.

21:43.834 --> 21:44.834
Thank you.

21:46.334 --> 21:49.101
Please, you check my alibi,
do whatever you have to do,

21:49.102 --> 21:51.402
But I--I'm begging you,
please leave my wife out of it.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.467
There are no promises,
Dr. Talbot.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.267
I am following
this investigation

21:55.301 --> 21:56.700
To wherever it leads.

21:58.200 --> 21:58.967
Daddy!

21:59.734 --> 22:02.334
Hey, buddy. Come here.
(Mrs. Talbot laughs)

22:05.067 --> 22:07.434
Detective Beckett, I didn't
expect to see you here today.

22:09.968 --> 22:11.234
Um, a clerk

22:11.235 --> 22:12.935
misplaced the notes
from our first interview,

22:12.936 --> 22:16.236
and your husband was very kind
to let us go over it all again.

22:16.237 --> 22:17.237
I see.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.800
Happy to help.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.601
Have a wonderful lunch.

22:22.434 --> 22:23.467
(Woman)
Yes, I'll hold.

22:24.001 --> 22:25.667
So you're asking about
last Thursday?

22:25.768 --> 22:26.768
That's right.

22:27.667 --> 22:28.967
That was a long day.

22:28.968 --> 22:30.468
we were booked solid
from mid-Morning on,

22:30.469 --> 22:31.969
then stayed late
for monthly inventory.

22:32.168 --> 22:33.300
Dr. Talbot, too?

22:33.501 --> 22:36.134
Uh, hi, yes. It's
Dr. Talbot's office calling.

22:36.834 --> 22:38.634
Him, too. We wrapped up
a little after 9:00.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.300
(Esposito) You gotta be
kidding. He alibied out?

22:42.367 --> 22:44.933
Oh, come on. We had him
arguing with our vic

22:44.934 --> 22:45.901
on the day of her murder.

22:45.902 --> 22:47.102
It wasn't him.

22:47.634 --> 22:48.434
(Karpowski)
Hey, Beckett.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.801
Just got off the horn
with the 74th in Brooklyn.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.401
Uniform recognized your vic's
name off the blotter,

22:53.402 --> 22:55.702
He thinks from a call he
answered about two years back.

22:55.801 --> 22:56.934
What kind of a call?

22:57.267 --> 22:59.000
Doesn't remember exactly,
and the incident report

22:59.001 --> 23:00.601
was never computerized,
but he's fairly sure

23:00.602 --> 23:02.202
someone filed a complaint
against your vic.

23:02.203 --> 23:03.203
That could be almost anything.

23:03.267 --> 23:04.700
Yeah, well, they should have
the file pulled by morning.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.234
Sounds like our vic
isn't as squeaky clean

23:07.235 --> 23:08.535
as we've been making
her out to be.

23:08.634 --> 23:10.700
Whatever the complaint is,
I'm gonna need the two of you

23:10.734 --> 23:12.067
To pick it up
first thing in the morning.

23:12.868 --> 23:15.168
Guys, I got two words to tide
you over in the meantime--

24:38.833 --> 24:40.867
Jeez. One night in Ibiza,
and what do I get,

24:40.868 --> 24:41.868
a chapter in "Storm Fall"?

24:42.734 --> 24:44.067
A very hot chapter.

24:44.068 --> 24:45.668
And she gets a whole book?

24:45.734 --> 24:47.533
She must be
pretty special girl.

24:48.733 --> 24:49.467
Let me ask you something,

24:49.468 --> 24:50.968
when she calls you,
do you call her back?

24:52.734 --> 24:53.367
Yeah.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.368
Of course you do,
because she's important to you

24:55.534 --> 24:56.367
and because it's polite.

24:56.368 --> 24:57.668
Paula, I-I call you back.

24:57.801 --> 25:00.500
3-Book deal, and I can't even
get you on the phone

25:00.501 --> 25:01.801
to let you know you got
an official offer?

25:02.067 --> 25:02.701
There's a...

25:03.233 --> 25:04.700
- Yeah.
- I'm--I...

25:05.667 --> 25:06.767
So can I close the deal?

25:07.833 --> 25:10.533
Paula, I'm sorry. This is a--
This is a big step for me.

25:10.534 --> 25:12.834
And I don't know that I'm ready
to walk away from Nikki Heat.

25:12.835 --> 25:13.635
Who, the one on the page

25:13.636 --> 25:16.036
or the one standing over there
in that Herve Leger dress?

25:16.901 --> 25:18.333
The one on the page.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.433
Oh, Rick.
Are you sleeping with her?

25:20.434 --> 25:21.234
No.

25:21.435 --> 25:22.635
Well, what the hell
are you waiting for?

25:22.636 --> 25:24.836
Go get it outta your system
and then come down to the office

25:24.837 --> 25:26.737
and sign the damn contract,
Okay?

25:39.300 --> 25:40.167
Hey.

25:40.168 --> 25:41.768
Hey. I...

25:41.869 --> 25:44.569
(Chuckles) I was just, uh,
the, uh,

25:44.570 --> 25:47.070
The dedication--Wow.
Thank you.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.833
I meant it.
You are extraordinary.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.168
Listen...

25:54.467 --> 25:55.701
I was thinking...

25:58.501 --> 26:00.367
What if the wife
got on to the affair?

26:02.034 --> 26:03.967
Melissa Talbot--A killer?

26:03.968 --> 26:05.968
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

26:05.969 --> 26:10.269
Well, uh...
anything's possible.

26:10.270 --> 26:12.870
- I didn't see it that way.
- Uh-Huh.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.671
You're just saying that 'cause
you've never been scorned.

26:15.272 --> 26:16.372
What makes you say that?

26:16.373 --> 26:18.873
Oh, come on. What man
has ever turned you away?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.367
So any word on a certain
British Secret Agent

26:24.368 --> 26:25.268
who shall not be named?

26:26.500 --> 26:27.534
I got the official offer.

26:28.467 --> 26:29.567
Wow.

26:30.201 --> 26:31.367
Congratulations.

26:31.368 --> 26:32.468
I haven't accepted it yet.

26:32.669 --> 26:34.069
But you're going to, aren't you?

26:34.167 --> 26:35.167
What, you think I should?

26:35.168 --> 26:39.068
Yeah. I mean... is there
a reason why you wouldn't?

26:40.167 --> 26:42.601
So you'd be Okay if I didn't
write another Nikki Heat?

26:42.668 --> 26:44.268
(Chuckles) I mean,
why wouldn't I?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.169
It's not like I asked you
to write the first one.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.134
You know, a lot of people
would be flattered

26:49.135 --> 26:52.035
that someone chose to
write a book based on them.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.936
- Flattered?
- Yeah.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.834
Do you have any idea
how much grief

26:56.967 --> 27:00.134
I've had to put up with
over this Nikki Heat thing?

27:00.167 --> 27:01.501
Gee, I'm sorry.

27:01.502 --> 27:03.502
I'm not asking you to be sorry.
I'm just...

27:05.167 --> 27:07.667
Just do whatever you want to do.
You always do anyway.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.668
Well, fine. It's settled then.

27:08.733 --> 27:10.168
- Fine.
- I'll do the other book.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.567
- Great.
- Enjoy the party.

27:11.568 --> 27:12.300
Thanks, I will.

27:12.301 --> 27:13.901
You know what? Just as well
because there really wasn't

27:13.902 --> 27:15.302
enough to the character
of Nikki Heat

27:15.303 --> 27:16.303
for more than one novel anyway.

27:16.704 --> 27:18.304
Oh, there's plenty
to the character.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.234
She just needs a better writer.

27:21.035 --> 27:21.635
Fine.

27:21.867 --> 27:22.600
Fine.

27:36.334 --> 27:39.501
(Indistinct conversations)

27:46.134 --> 27:47.367
What are you doing here,
Castle?

27:47.368 --> 27:49.968
Don't you have bigger,
more lucrative fish to fry?

27:50.601 --> 27:52.700
Actually, I just left
my sunglasses here yesterday.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.601
Oh, please.

27:53.701 --> 27:56.301
That is the lamest excuse
I have ever...

27:59.134 --> 27:59.900
You know what?

27:59.967 --> 28:02.400
While you're at it,
don't forget those.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.368
Did you guys get
the incident report?

28:06.369 --> 28:07.369
Yeah.

28:08.100 --> 28:08.801
And?

28:08.802 --> 28:10.202
Apparently, Eliska was, uh, seen

28:10.203 --> 28:12.203
on multiple occasions
hanging around some local park.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.801
and at some point, she walked up to
somebody's kid and spoke to 'em.

28:15.001 --> 28:16.800
Kid's mom thought it was
a little odd

28:16.801 --> 28:18.500
because she wasn't there
with a child of her own,

28:18.600 --> 28:20.134
So mom mentioned
it to a patrolman.

28:20.435 --> 28:21.335
Any charges filed?

28:21.668 --> 28:23.833
Nah. Supposedly she was very
cooperative and left quietly.

28:24.534 --> 28:26.034
Sounds a lot like the incident
with the Talbot boy.

28:26.135 --> 28:29.335
Mm-Hmm. Poor lady. You gotta
feel for what she went through.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.634
Sorry to interrupt, but your
vic's super's on the phone

28:32.635 --> 28:34.435
and wants to know if he can
go ahead and rent her apartment.

28:34.934 --> 28:36.167
She's paid all the way
till Friday,

28:36.168 --> 28:37.568
but he's got somebody
who wants it now.

28:37.567 --> 28:38.501
Tell him to go ahead.

28:38.502 --> 28:40.502
We already have everything
we need from the crime scene.

28:40.534 --> 28:41.867
You guys check with the mom
who filed the report.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.467
There might be something more
to it than we realize.

28:43.968 --> 28:44.668
On it.

28:52.633 --> 28:53.568
You're still here.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.668
Karpowski, did the super say
she was paid up to Friday?

29:00.234 --> 29:01.001
That's what he said.

29:01.802 --> 29:02.802
That doesn't make any sense.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.001
That place rents by the week.

29:05.902 --> 29:06.902
She was killed last Thursday.

29:08.001 --> 29:09.834
How could she  paid up
through this coming Friday?

29:13.934 --> 29:15.300
(Man) Eliska never missed
a payment.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.134
Yeah, I found her rent money
slid under my door on Friday.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.834
I didn't think anything of it

29:20.835 --> 29:22.235
because I didn't know
she was dead yet,

29:23.067 --> 29:24.667
Not until you guys showed up
the next day.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.534
Now why would someone pay
her rent after she's dead?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.367
Whoever killed her
must have figured there'd be

29:29.368 --> 29:31.368
less chance she'd be
reported missing that way.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.969
Look, I-I don't wanna seem cold
or anything.

29:34.034 --> 29:36.434
Uh, she was a nice lady.
May she rest in peace.

29:36.467 --> 29:37.701
But can I rent the apartment?

29:38.401 --> 29:39.700
Should I give her stuff
to her friend?

29:40.101 --> 29:41.401
(Castle and Beckett)
Her friend?

29:41.534 --> 29:43.934
Yeah, the lady who picks up
her mail every day.

29:43.935 --> 29:45.235
Someone is picking up
her mail?

29:45.634 --> 29:47.101
Yeah, she got a key
to the mailbox.

29:47.201 --> 29:48.700
I figure it was a friend,
a relative.

29:48.901 --> 29:49.901
What does this friend
look like?

29:50.434 --> 29:53.701
Oh, well-dressed,
early 40s, blonde hair.

29:55.068 --> 29:56.368
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

29:56.767 --> 29:58.168
Melissa Talbot.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.667
The super said he remembered her

30:01.534 --> 30:03.267
coming in the hallway
around lunchtime.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.467
It's already past 2:00.

30:05.267 --> 30:06.234
A threatening letter...

30:08.000 --> 30:08.967
I've been sitting here thinking,

30:08.968 --> 30:10.568
what reason
would the wife have

30:10.569 --> 30:12.169
to want to intercept
Eliska's mail.

30:12.470 --> 30:14.470
Maybe she sent her some kind
of threatening letter,

30:14.501 --> 30:16.267
A "keep your hands off my man"
kinda thing.

30:16.868 --> 30:18.468
She gets impatient,
she confronts her,

30:18.469 --> 30:19.469
and then Eliska's dead.

30:19.501 --> 30:21.168
Meanwhile, the letter
is still en route.

30:21.633 --> 30:24.434
So... Talbot's afraid
it'll connect them.

30:24.534 --> 30:26.334
The irony is, it never
would've connected them.

30:27.568 --> 30:28.500
We don't go through
a victim's mail

30:28.501 --> 30:30.467
unless there's probable cause
and a warrant first.

30:32.168 --> 30:33.268
Thank you.

30:33.567 --> 30:34.300
For what?

30:34.334 --> 30:36.934
For using "irony" correctly.

30:37.434 --> 30:38.768
Ever since
that Alanis Morissette song,

30:38.769 --> 30:40.669
people use it when they
actually mean "coincidence."

30:40.670 --> 30:41.570
drives me nuts.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.367
Yeah, well, it must be

30:43.368 --> 30:44.868
your great
grammatical influence over me.

30:46.567 --> 30:47.368
I may be going,

30:47.369 --> 30:49.269
but I'm leaving
something of myself behind.

31:02.334 --> 31:03.900
Castle, it's her.

31:04.168 --> 31:06.334
It's Talbot's wife.
Come on.

31:09.768 --> 31:10.967
(Beckett)
She's going for the mail.

31:15.367 --> 31:16.367
Mrs. Talbot.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.533
Whoa. You're not the wife.
You're the nurse.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.034
(Voice breaking)
Dr. Talbot is good man.

31:27.501 --> 31:29.100
I've worked for him
for ten years.

31:30.067 --> 31:32.467
I know he had nothing to do
with what happened to that lady.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.267
What exactly did he
tell you to do?

31:37.633 --> 31:38.933
He kept a little apartment
for her...

31:39.867 --> 31:41.901
Where they would... meet.

31:44.801 --> 31:46.434
He gave me a key
to the mailbox.

31:47.534 --> 31:48.867
He said he'd sent
her a check.

31:49.633 --> 31:52.467
He'd felt bad about the way
things had ended between them,

31:52.533 --> 31:54.001
and he wanted to give her
some money.

31:54.467 --> 31:57.134
Is that what's in here,
a check?

31:58.768 --> 31:59.334
He told me to look

31:59.335 --> 32:01.335
for an envelope
stamped "confidential"

32:01.634 --> 32:04.267
with an address from New Jersey
from his brokerage account.

32:05.767 --> 32:08.034
He wanted me to get the check
so no one would be able

32:08.035 --> 32:10.035
to put the two of them together.
That's all.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.400
You were helping him
cover the affair.

32:12.834 --> 32:14.000
It doesn't mean he killed her.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.000
When you told us he worked late
at the office that day,

32:18.134 --> 32:19.001
Were you telling the truth?

32:20.367 --> 32:21.768
He didn't stay late that night.

32:23.867 --> 32:24.967
He left at 6:00.

32:25.634 --> 32:28.767
So the envelope came from
an office park in Paramus.

32:29.434 --> 32:32.368
Is there a, uh, brokerage firm
of some kind there?

32:32.668 --> 32:33.634
"Trueway Insurance.

32:33.635 --> 32:37.535
Chromo Diagnostic Lab Systems.
Branby Financial Group."

32:38.100 --> 32:39.434
That would be
where the check came from

32:39.435 --> 32:40.835
if Talbot
was telling the truth.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.001
I got a feeling he wasn't even
telling the truth

32:43.002 --> 32:44.202
about the affair with Eliska.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.433
He's hiding something.

32:45.734 --> 32:46.834
The answer is in here.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.367
How long before
the warrant comes through

32:48.368 --> 32:49.168
and we can open it?

32:49.267 --> 32:50.467
Couple of hours at least.

32:53.367 --> 32:55.167
Hey, did you find the mom
who filed the complaint?

32:55.468 --> 32:56.368
Found her. Talked to her.

32:56.534 --> 32:57.401
It all went down pretty much

32:57.402 --> 32:58.602
the way the incident report said.

32:59.201 --> 33:01.834
Turns out the reason that
the mom first noticed our vic

33:01.900 --> 33:03.367
Hanging around the playground
was that she said

33:03.368 --> 33:04.368
she looked kinda familiar.

33:04.467 --> 33:05.568
As it happens, they were both

33:05.569 --> 33:07.569
in the same post-delivery ward
in the hospital.

33:07.602 --> 33:10.002
Yeah, both babies were born
on the same day.

33:10.501 --> 33:12.367
Can you believe that?
Both boys, too.

33:12.368 --> 33:13.768
Did she happen to mention
what hospital?

33:14.467 --> 33:15.868
Yeah, Bryant General. Why?

33:16.433 --> 33:18.100
Bryant General,
where Talbot works.

33:18.267 --> 33:19.134
What are you on to, Castle?

33:19.635 --> 33:22.135
I'm not sure, but I wonder

33:22.136 --> 33:24.336
if we look into it, if we're
gonna find that the Talbot boy

33:25.134 --> 33:27.367
Was born at Bryant General
on the same day as well.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.368
Would you check that for me?

33:30.867 --> 33:33.367
Did you say that there was
a-a lab at that office?

33:33.400 --> 33:35.500
Yeah,
Chromo Diagnostic Lab Systems.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.634
I think I know
what's in that envelope.

33:38.367 --> 33:39.800
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.067
We want to help you
in any way that we can,

33:42.134 --> 33:44.200
but like we already told you,
we barely knew the woman.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.467
She had only been working
in the building a few months.

33:46.868 --> 33:47.668
As it turns out,

33:47.669 --> 33:49.269
your paths crossed
long before you realized.

33:51.234 --> 33:54.067
Eliska Sokol had a son who was
born in the same hospital

33:54.068 --> 33:56.168
on the same day
as your boy Zane.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.968
(Castle) He passed away
three years ago.

33:59.134 --> 34:00.567
He died of
Niemann-Pick Syndrome.

34:01.167 --> 34:02.434
It's a rare
congenital disorder.

34:04.401 --> 34:06.734
Oh, my god.
That poor woman.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.400
That's probably why she was
so attentive to Zane.

34:10.501 --> 34:11.467
They were the same age.

34:11.868 --> 34:13.467
Actually, we think there was
more to it than that.

34:14.068 --> 34:14.701
How so?

34:15.101 --> 34:17.502
The incident with the candy
that you told us about.

34:17.934 --> 34:19.699
We think she gave that to him
to distract him

34:19.801 --> 34:21.101
so she could swab his mouth.

34:22.134 --> 34:24.134
Swabbed his mouth?
What for?

34:24.766 --> 34:26.368
She was trying to get
a D.N.A. test done.

34:28.568 --> 34:31.368
I--Why would she--
I mean, I don't...

34:31.667 --> 34:33.400
We got a warrant
for Eliska's mail.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.467
Just before she was killed,
she sent two mouth swabs

34:36.567 --> 34:38.301
to a mail-order lab
in New Jersey.

34:38.701 --> 34:39.833
One of them
was your son's.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.234
The other was hers.

34:45.568 --> 34:46.367
These were the results.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.766
I'm sorry, Melissa.

34:52.368 --> 34:53.234
I'm so sorry.

34:55.867 --> 34:56.967
When the amnio came back,

34:56.967 --> 34:58.168
I just didn't know
how to tell you,

34:58.234 --> 35:01.334
And I knew you'd--you'd just--
you'd just see it through

35:01.367 --> 35:03.367
No matter what the test said,
and I thought I'd just--

35:03.733 --> 35:06.168
I'd put it off and deal with it
after the baby was born.

35:06.667 --> 35:09.367
Cameron, I don't understand
what you're saying.

35:09.734 --> 35:12.834
The Niemann-Pick...
our baby had Niemann-Pick.

35:12.935 --> 35:15.635
No, Zane is fine.
What are you talking about?

35:15.700 --> 35:16.701
There's no treatment.

35:16.734 --> 35:19.367
It's always fatal...
usually by age 3.

35:22.268 --> 35:23.700
I don't even think
it crossed my mind

35:23.800 --> 35:25.000
That I could get away with it

35:25.600 --> 35:27.601
until I was in the nursery
checking on the baby.

35:28.967 --> 35:29.767
You were still in recovery,

35:29.867 --> 35:32.400
and there they were,
side by side in their cribs.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.434
I just thought,
how hard would it be?

35:37.734 --> 35:40.200
No one would suspect.
They all know me around here.

35:40.267 --> 35:41.734
They see me
practically every day.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.401
I can change the charts later.

35:45.001 --> 35:48.401
Right now... I just
have to switch the tags

35:48.534 --> 35:51.034
And pick him up and bring him
to you in the room,

35:52.267 --> 35:53.701
And everything would be
all right.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.100
He'd be ours.

35:57.668 --> 35:58.900
And you'd never have to know.

36:00.467 --> 36:02.501
Cameron, please tell me
you didn't kill that woman.

36:04.367 --> 36:06.934
Please, god. Tell me
you didn't kill that woman.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.267
(Voice breaking)
Oh, my god.

36:13.467 --> 36:14.401
Oh, my god.

36:14.402 --> 36:15.702
I couldn't let her
destroy our lives.

36:16.667 --> 36:17.667
I couldn't let her take him away.

36:21.467 --> 36:22.567
What am I gonna do?

36:25.234 --> 36:27.767
Please, someone tell me,
what am I supposed to do?

36:30.667 --> 36:32.467
(Beckett) After Talbot dumped
Eliska's body,

36:32.468 --> 36:34.468
He grabbed her keys
and went back to her apartment

36:34.469 --> 36:36.669
to get rid of anything else
that connected the two of them.

36:36.670 --> 36:38.370
That's when he found
the paperwork for the lab.

36:39.768 --> 36:41.301
Nice detective work,
you two.

36:41.302 --> 36:42.002
actually, sir...

36:43.303 --> 36:44.303
it's Eliska Sokol

36:44.304 --> 36:46.204
who deserves the credit
for the detective work.

36:46.734 --> 36:47.633
The way we figure it,

36:47.967 --> 36:49.567
she got the job with
the hospital cleaning crew

36:49.667 --> 36:51.701
<i>Solely to get access
to the birth records.</i>

36:52.001 --> 36:54.200
She made it her mission
to find out the truth.

36:54.901 --> 36:56.201
Yeah, but then it cost her
her life.

36:57.534 --> 36:58.900
Seems so pointless somehow.

37:00.334 --> 37:01.367
Maybe not.

37:02.534 --> 37:03.201
Thank you.

37:05.067 --> 37:07.501
My hands...they're shaking.

37:08.734 --> 37:09.568
It'll be Okay.

37:10.134 --> 37:11.734
We told Mrs. Talbot
that you have no intention

37:11.735 --> 37:13.035
of taking Zane away.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.334
She knows you just want
to be a part of his life.

37:18.300 --> 37:18.801
Hello.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.367
Mrs. Talbot.

37:20.601 --> 37:22.367
Please... call me Melissa.

37:25.767 --> 37:26.501
Won't you come in?

37:56.301 --> 37:57.534
He is beautiful.

37:58.834 --> 37:59.701
Yes, he is.

38:08.267 --> 38:10.934
Tell me about him...
my son.

38:12.367 --> 38:13.100
What was he like?

38:16.034 --> 38:17.834
He was a beautiful boy, too.

38:23.867 --> 38:24.400
For you.

38:31.867 --> 38:34.334
- Mama.
- Yes, baby.

38:34.434 --> 38:36.167
The wheel came off
my train.

38:37.100 --> 38:37.833
Oh.

38:39.633 --> 38:40.601
Give me.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.634
(Clicks)

38:48.834 --> 38:50.700
Ah, there.

38:51.068 --> 38:52.001
All fixed.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.567
(Whispers)
Go ahead.

39:15.834 --> 39:16.801
Thank you, Castle.

39:17.900 --> 39:18.634
I, um...

39:20.201 --> 39:22.367
I never would've been able
to solve this case

39:22.368 --> 39:23.268
without your help.

39:26.967 --> 39:27.701
Well, uh...

39:28.801 --> 39:30.667
Good luck
on your new book.

39:32.234 --> 39:33.467
I know
that you'll do it proud.

39:33.767 --> 39:34.500
Thanks.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.467
You take care of yourself.

39:50.733 --> 39:52.634
And--
(Cell phone rings)

39:53.533 --> 39:54.367
Oh. My agent.
(Second cell phone ringing)

39:54.701 --> 39:55.468
Oh.

39:55.668 --> 39:57.901
It's the, uh, the s-Station.

39:59.367 --> 40:00.001
(Ring)

40:01.100 --> 40:02.834
(Ring)
uh, you know,
you better get that.

40:03.001 --> 40:03.867
(Ring)
Yeah.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.967
(Beep)

40:06.067 --> 40:07.200
- Beckett.
- Hey, Paula.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.567
Ah, really?

40:10.834 --> 40:12.533
First day
"Heat Wave" sales--

40:12.534 --> 40:13.234
-Through the roof.
- Oh!

40:14.835 --> 40:16.335
I'm on hold
for Captain Montgomery.

40:17.868 --> 40:18.900
Reviews are raves.

40:18.933 --> 40:19.534
(Whispers)
Yes.

40:20.934 --> 40:21.568
(Normal voice)
Yes, Captain.

40:21.669 --> 40:25.169
Would I be interested in doing
three more Nikki Heats?

40:25.234 --> 40:27.067
Yes, I am aware
that the Mayor

40:27.068 --> 40:29.068
is facing a tough
re-election this year.

40:29.401 --> 40:31.334
I'm--I'm sorry. How much?

40:31.434 --> 40:33.501
No, I-I would love to help
the department out

40:33.534 --> 40:34.434
in whatever way I could.

40:34.435 --> 40:36.235
No, no,
forget the other offer.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.267
For that kind of money,
I'll do a dozen Nikki Heats.

40:38.334 --> 40:39.400
He wants me to what?

40:39.634 --> 40:42.867
Oh. Well, that was kind of
a onetime only situation

40:42.934 --> 40:44.200
with her and me.

40:44.234 --> 40:47.433
Three books?
That would take forever.

40:47.601 --> 40:48.833
You already spoke to the Mayor?

40:49.134 --> 40:50.134
(Whispers)
I'm gonna kill you!

40:51.068 --> 40:53.267
(Normal voice) No, no, no, no,
sir. I wasn't talking to you.

40:53.268 --> 40:54.467
- I, uh--
- Okay.

40:54.567 --> 40:55.434
No need to thank me, sir.

40:55.534 --> 40:59.000
I am happy to help hizzoner out
in any way I can.

40:59.401 --> 41:00.101
Uh-Huh.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.967
You--You know what?
(Beep)

41:02.467 --> 41:05.468
I think--I'm gonna--
Okay, Paula--I'm gonna...

41:05.469 --> 41:07.069
(Whispers) I'll, um, I'll
call you--I'll call you back.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.367
(Normal voice) I had nothing
to do with that phone call.
(Cell phone rings)

41:10.234 --> 41:11.900
(Beep)
What?!

41:15.267 --> 41:16.001
Okay.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.200
I'll be right there.

41:20.100 --> 41:20.934
Where are you going?

41:21.467 --> 41:23.167
That was Esposito.
There's been a murder.

41:28.667 --> 41:29.667
Are you coming or what?

41:34.501 --> 41:35.534
Do you really expect me
to believe

41:35.634 --> 41:37.201
<i>U had nothing to do
with that phone call?</i>

41:37.202 --> 41:39.202
I swear, I had nothing
to do with it.

41:39.267 --> 41:41.367
Swear a little harder,
Castle. I don't believe you.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.668
(Whispers) I really swear!
