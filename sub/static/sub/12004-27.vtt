00:01.777 --> 00:03.094
You're gonna wear
a sweater with that, right?

00:03.146 --> 00:04.212
No, I'm good.

00:04.247 --> 00:05.981
If you're trying
to catch someone's eye...

00:06.015 --> 00:07.082
oh my God, mom.

00:07.116 --> 00:08.200
This is not about some boy.

00:10.987 --> 00:12.170
Oh, uh...

00:12.205 --> 00:14.956
Yeah, I'm actually
all good with glasses.

00:14.991 --> 00:16.123
- Woo!
- <i>( Cheering )</i>

00:17.260 --> 00:19.060
- I'm Nikki.
- Toby.

00:19.095 --> 00:21.062
We're having another one
of these next week

00:21.097 --> 00:23.265
if you want to swing by.

00:23.299 --> 00:25.100
I thought we were
kind of the same.

00:25.134 --> 00:26.268
I just know that you get this

00:26.302 --> 00:28.904
huge part of my life

00:28.938 --> 00:30.872
that no one else gets.

00:31.908 --> 00:32.908
I will paint over this

00:32.942 --> 00:35.076
again and again
day in and day out.

00:35.111 --> 00:36.144
I will not let them win.

00:36.179 --> 00:37.812
You know the girl
that was painted here?

00:37.847 --> 00:38.947
Graffiti on the wall?

00:38.981 --> 00:40.749
- I did it.
- You defaced my wall?

00:40.783 --> 00:42.217
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>
<i>- Thought you would like it.</i>

00:42.251 --> 00:43.919
I feel like I don't know you.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.970
so then Angelo moved
out of the guest house

01:01.988 --> 01:03.738
- and into our house.
- ( Chuckles )

01:03.773 --> 01:05.489
Zarra: One big happy family.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.609
Yeah, we're still working
on that "happy" part.

01:07.643 --> 01:08.693
Hmm.

01:08.744 --> 01:11.463
When I was a kid, it was just
me and my mom mostly.

01:11.497 --> 01:13.615
- My dad was in and out.
- Are they divorced?

01:13.649 --> 01:15.450
They might well have been.

01:15.484 --> 01:16.768
Oh, he spent more time
with his crew

01:16.802 --> 01:17.852
than with us.

01:17.887 --> 01:19.437
He was a writer.

01:19.472 --> 01:20.522
"Nept2n."

01:20.556 --> 01:21.656
Your dad is nept2n?

01:21.691 --> 01:22.824
The guy who did
the back-to-back

01:22.858 --> 01:24.659
off the bell street exit ramp?

01:24.694 --> 01:25.893
Yeah, you know it?

01:25.912 --> 01:27.829
Yeah, do I know it.
It's awesome.

01:27.863 --> 01:29.631
No one's touched
that piece in years.

01:29.665 --> 01:32.500
- He's a legend.
- The hell is this?

01:32.518 --> 01:33.535
No way.

01:33.569 --> 01:35.353
Dude.

01:35.388 --> 01:37.539
That son of a bitch.

01:37.573 --> 01:38.740
This guy's been marking pieces

01:38.774 --> 01:40.475
all over the north side.

01:40.509 --> 01:42.344
Well, maybe we can fix it.

01:42.378 --> 01:45.380
Why? So  can come
and slash our stuff again?

01:45.414 --> 01:46.598
No, dude.
This guy better watch out

01:46.632 --> 01:48.383
that I don't find him, man.
It's on now.

Bay, I know it's been
a hard time for you lately

03:02.091 --> 03:05.093
with Emmett and everything.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.229
Mom, no.
This is not about that.

03:08.264 --> 03:09.798
It's not even about Emmett.

03:09.832 --> 03:12.000
I was doing this
way before I ever met him.

03:13.269 --> 03:15.203
How long has this
been going on?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.142
- About two years.
- John: <i>What?!</i>

03:21.177 --> 03:22.927
Two years? Are you kidding me?

03:22.978 --> 03:24.979
We have always been supportive

03:25.014 --> 03:26.047
of your creativity.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.849
All those art classes?
All of this?

03:27.883 --> 03:29.050
And this is dangerous.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.285
What if something
happened to you?

03:30.319 --> 03:32.153
Not to mention
you could wind up in jail.

03:32.188 --> 03:33.822
Yes.

03:33.856 --> 03:36.224
So, what? I'm grounded

03:36.258 --> 03:38.193
Yeah. Because that works.

03:39.962 --> 03:42.964
No. We're leaving it up to you.

03:42.998 --> 03:45.100
We know who you are at heart.

03:45.134 --> 03:48.236
We know you know the difference
between right and wrong.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.305
And that you're
a person of integrity.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.041

04:09.925 --> 04:11.092
at any time.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.194
No, we have to give her
a chance to do the right thing.

06:02.171 --> 06:03.755
Thank you.

06:03.806 --> 06:05.974
I guess I underestimated
how heavy they were.

06:06.008 --> 06:08.176
Oh yeah. Don't worry about it.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.895
Angelo has been
helping out a lot,

06:10.930 --> 06:13.815
- but...
- Oh, how's it going in lake Michigan?

06:13.849 --> 06:15.049
Well, I just talked
to him last night

06:15.067 --> 06:17.185
and he said that
the job is going great

06:17.219 --> 06:19.153
and your friends'
lake house is beautiful.

06:19.188 --> 06:22.257
- Yeah.
- Another thank you that I owe you.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.792
Well, Angelo's
a wonderful carpenter.

06:24.827 --> 06:25.777
Where do you want these?

06:25.828 --> 06:26.778

open house at Carlton

06:32.067 --> 06:33.268
is this week.

06:33.302 --> 06:35.904
And I thought that maybe

06:35.938 --> 06:38.239
you and John might
like to come along.

06:38.257 --> 06:40.074
We would love to.

06:40.092 --> 06:41.943
And you know,
if you're having any trouble

06:41.977 --> 06:44.012
talking to her teachers,
my signings getting pretty good.

06:44.046 --> 06:45.213
I can interpret for all of us.

06:45.247 --> 06:46.915
They have interpreters there.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.117
Not all the kids' parents sign.

06:49.151 --> 06:51.035
Right. Of course.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.870
Ow.

06:52.922 --> 06:54.789
Uh, you know,

06:54.823 --> 06:57.025
John has this amazing
orthopedic surgeon...

06:57.059 --> 06:58.726
Jason Fuller.

06:58.761 --> 07:00.595
He's worked on the whole team.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.930
I could give you
his information

07:01.964 --> 07:02.997
and if you can't get
an appointment,

07:03.032 --> 07:04.966
I could make a call.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.701

08:56.211 --> 08:57.712

08:57.746 --> 08:58.746
we'll post it on the blog,

08:58.781 --> 08:59.781
and then we'll stake it out.

08:59.815 --> 09:00.982

and then bust him.

of him slashing our piece,

09:04.820 --> 09:06.754

09:30.713 --> 09:32.447
puts his art

my break earlier.

11:25.761 --> 11:27.629
Yeah, sweetie? Whoa whoa whoa.

11:27.663 --> 11:28.596
Can you help me out here?

11:32.701 --> 11:35.320

11:35.371 --> 11:36.337
Uh-huh.

11:41.544 --> 11:43.178
And, um.

11:43.212 --> 11:45.280
How about his family?

11:45.314 --> 11:48.216
I know they don't sign.

11:48.250 --> 11:52.220
And they don't seem
very interested in school.

11:53.489 --> 11:55.423
- Why?
- You know, he's always at work.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.475
He never wants
to go home. Never.

12:01.030 --> 12:03.031
When no one signs at home,

12:03.065 --> 12:05.300
kids can feel pretty lonely.

12:18.247 --> 12:19.280
Sure.

12:19.315 --> 12:21.950
Uh, your text
sounded kind of urgent.

12:21.984 --> 12:23.218
Is everything okay?

12:28.224 --> 12:30.825
Okay.

12:34.096 --> 12:36.798
Yeah.

12:42.972 --> 12:44.722
Wow. Uh...

12:44.773 --> 12:46.174
Isn't he her boss?

12:52.831 --> 12:53.815
Wait wait.

12:53.849 --> 12:55.617
Your mom

12:55.651 --> 12:58.953
and the guy that Daphne
has a crush on

12:58.988 --> 12:59.921
are hooking up?

13:02.658 --> 13:04.659
How old is he?

13:08.597 --> 13:09.831
And he's hearing?

13:09.899 --> 13:11.666
Melody's dating a hearing guy

13:11.684 --> 13:12.884
after all the crap
that she gave me?

13:14.003 --> 13:15.803
Yeah, you think?

13:18.641 --> 13:20.808
So I'm assuming
Daphne doesn't know

13:20.843 --> 13:23.611
about your mom and the guy?

13:31.820 --> 13:35.423
Well, Daphne'd be
super embarrassed,

13:35.457 --> 13:37.725
and it's just a crush.

13:37.759 --> 13:40.428
It probably won't
turn into anything.

13:41.730 --> 13:44.532
I say no, just keep it
to yourself.

13:48.671 --> 13:52.473
I was thinking
about you today actually.

13:52.508 --> 13:55.343
I've been wanting
to take some pictures

13:55.377 --> 13:57.478
of some pieces that I've put
up around the bus yard.

13:59.398 --> 14:02.433
And I was wondering if I
could borrow your camera?

14:18.334 --> 14:19.567
No thanks. I'll be careful.

14:20.669 --> 14:22.370
I really appreciate this.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.492
But nothing has changed

14:27.526 --> 14:28.643
with us.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.232
The Plaza?
What's going on there?

14:53.168 --> 14:54.502
Yeah, I don't know.

14:54.536 --> 14:56.437
I'll let you know
if I'll meet up with you.

14:56.472 --> 14:57.538
All right. Peace.

15:02.244 --> 15:04.479
Waterfall... carton
didn't touch the lips.

15:04.513 --> 15:06.114
Oh.

15:06.148 --> 15:07.448
So...

15:07.483 --> 15:11.069
How do you feel
about hang gliding?

15:11.120 --> 15:13.287
Terrified. Why?

15:13.322 --> 15:14.422
I don't know.

15:16.342 --> 15:18.226
Okay, how about a movie?

15:19.461 --> 15:22.146
Dad, I'm fine.

15:22.181 --> 15:24.165
You and mom just need to relax.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.400
We're not worried about you.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.035
You know, it's just...

15:27.069 --> 15:28.102
you and me...

15:28.137 --> 15:30.038
dad, we're fine.

15:30.072 --> 15:31.139
The cat's in the cradle.

15:31.173 --> 15:32.407
Or it's not.

15:32.441 --> 15:34.409
I don't know.
Well, whatever's good.

15:34.443 --> 15:37.929
Okay. You want to hang
with kids your own age,

15:37.963 --> 15:40.114
I get it. I get it.

15:40.149 --> 15:41.966
It's nothing personal.

15:42.017 --> 15:44.051
Cheves and Burf and the guys

15:44.069 --> 15:45.219
are meeting down at the Plaza.

15:45.254 --> 15:47.088
Oh, sounds like fun.

15:47.122 --> 15:48.356
Have a good time.

15:48.390 --> 15:51.225
And use a glass next time.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.857
I don't care how many fancy
sauces you put with them.

16:05.891 --> 16:07.191
Donuts are not food.

16:07.226 --> 16:09.777
- They're a fad.
- Oh, yeah.

16:09.812 --> 16:11.112
Is that why
you ate seven of them?

16:11.146 --> 16:13.197
I did not eat seven.

16:13.232 --> 16:14.232
Yes, you did.

16:14.283 --> 16:16.017
There were nine on the plate

16:16.051 --> 16:18.086
and I had two.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.820
So,

16:19.838 --> 16:21.756
you're a scorekeeper.

16:21.790 --> 16:23.124
Oh, no. I just
like to make sure

16:23.142 --> 16:25.059
I get my fair share.

16:25.094 --> 16:27.128
You think the world is fair.

16:27.162 --> 16:29.764
And you keep trying
to tell me who I am.

16:29.798 --> 16:31.733
You like to argue.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.034
Hey, pardon me.

16:37.806 --> 16:38.840
Sorry.

16:40.909 --> 16:42.076
It's no problem.

16:46.115 --> 16:47.849
What if I'm nothing

16:47.883 --> 16:49.117
like who you think I am?

16:53.789 --> 16:55.757
Then I guess I'd better
get to know you better.

17:02.931 --> 17:05.715
I should go.

17:06.852 --> 17:09.854
That, uh... that's
probably a good idea.

17:10.906 --> 17:11.856
Good night.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.523
Good night.

17:23.858 --> 17:24.942
You know, not to mention the fact that Angelo

17:24.992 --> 17:27.611
always leaves the 40-pound
plates in the curl bar.

17:27.662 --> 17:28.779
Now, look, I can handle that,

17:28.830 --> 17:29.947
but not when I'm warming up.

17:29.998 --> 17:31.615
( Sighs )

17:31.666 --> 17:32.867
Maybe she can't afford it.

17:33.902 --> 17:35.736
- What?
- Regina.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.638
She still hasn't
called Dr. Fuller.

17:37.672 --> 17:39.006
Maybe the reason she hasn't

17:39.040 --> 17:40.641
is because she can't afford it.

17:40.675 --> 17:43.811
We have no idea what kind of
health insurance she has.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.580
You know, I had forgotten
the pre-book whirlwind

17:46.615 --> 17:47.781
that is Kathryn Kennish.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.949
What are you talking about?

17:48.984 --> 17:50.751
Oh, I don't know.
You found Angelo a job,

17:50.785 --> 17:52.620
you're coordinating
the Carlton open house,

17:52.654 --> 17:54.488
you're micromanaging
Regina's health care.

17:54.522 --> 17:55.823
You do like a project or three.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.675
Yeah, but Regina not signing

17:57.709 --> 17:59.593
has to be affecting Daphne.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.844
So,

18:00.879 --> 18:02.680
maybe we should ask Regina

18:02.731 --> 18:04.598
if she needs some help
with her medical bills.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.901
Sweetie, Daphne's fine and
Regina has never responded well

18:06.935 --> 18:08.774
when we interfere
in her personal affairs.

18:08.808 --> 18:10.576
<i>Plus</i>

18:10.610 --> 18:11.777
to lend money to friends.

18:11.811 --> 18:12.878
Remember Rudy Metzger?

18:12.912 --> 18:15.414
When I invested in his
sporting goods store?

18:15.448 --> 18:18.450
Yeah, well,
Regina is not a friend.

18:18.485 --> 18:19.685
She's family.

18:19.719 --> 18:20.853
Yeah, that raises the stakes.

18:20.887 --> 18:22.387
Where do we stop?

18:22.422 --> 18:23.689
Her sister, her cousin? What?

18:23.723 --> 18:25.591
Oh, come on.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.693
Honey, it is a slippery slope

18:27.727 --> 18:30.429
that only ends with
everyone feeling bad.

18:37.670 --> 18:40.339
"I really appreciate what
you're doing for Carlton."

18:40.373 --> 18:41.573
It is my pleasure.

18:41.608 --> 18:44.409
Although, I am going
to make one change.

18:44.444 --> 18:47.312
I'm going to substitute
the short rib tacos

18:47.347 --> 18:48.313
for the <i>lo pobre.</i>

18:48.348 --> 18:49.648
It's a signature dish for us.

18:51.351 --> 18:52.684
Did you get any of that?

18:52.719 --> 18:54.419
No.

18:54.454 --> 18:55.420
Yes.

18:55.455 --> 18:57.322
( Chuckles )

19:07.667 --> 19:08.634
I'd love to.

19:08.668 --> 19:11.303
Unfortunately
I have to work late.

19:12.539 --> 19:13.505
Okay.

19:17.210 --> 19:18.410
Rain check.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.412
Rain check. Got it.

19:22.599 --> 19:24.483
Well, thank you for dinner.

19:24.517 --> 19:25.517
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:25.552 --> 19:27.152
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:30.456 --> 19:31.373
Bye.

19:44.204 --> 19:46.238
Oh, hey.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.523
What are you looking for?

19:47.574 --> 19:50.075
Butter.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.376
I'm making cookies.

19:51.411 --> 19:52.477
I ran out.

19:52.512 --> 19:54.279
I'm no chef,

19:54.297 --> 19:57.416
but I think...

19:57.450 --> 20:00.352
That this is what
you're looking for.

20:00.386 --> 20:02.187
Yeah.

20:04.390 --> 20:06.024
Are you okay?

20:06.059 --> 20:07.125
Yeah.

20:11.431 --> 20:15.000
Chef and I almost kissed.

20:15.034 --> 20:18.120
Uhh...

20:18.171 --> 20:20.255
How almost?

20:20.306 --> 20:22.140
If I hadn't gotten into my car,

20:22.175 --> 20:25.143
it totally would have happened.

20:25.178 --> 20:27.379
Isn't he a little old for you?

20:27.413 --> 20:30.215
Well, John's older
than Kathryn.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.283
Right?

20:31.317 --> 20:34.253
Yes, but it's
only by a few years.

20:34.287 --> 20:37.356
Plus he was never her boss.

20:37.390 --> 20:39.258
And, you know,

20:39.292 --> 20:42.094
they didn't meet
until way after

20:42.128 --> 20:43.896
she finished college.

20:45.365 --> 20:47.065
Wow.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.268
When did you start
following all the rules?

20:49.302 --> 20:50.903
Daphne.

20:52.906 --> 20:54.907
I think there's something
you need to know

20:54.941 --> 20:56.808
about this guy.

22:09.984 --> 22:11.985
Honey, there's Travis.

22:14.689 --> 22:15.922
Oh, yeah.

22:15.956 --> 22:17.924
Why is everything so small?

22:17.958 --> 22:19.593
It's tapas.

22:20.668 --> 22:22.469
Maybe his parents came.

22:22.504 --> 22:23.637
Who?

22:23.671 --> 22:26.723
Travis. Maybe
his parents are here.

22:26.775 --> 22:29.510
It's unlikely, given what
Melody was telling us.

22:29.544 --> 22:31.495
Yeah, well,

22:31.529 --> 22:33.497
I think you should find them

22:33.531 --> 22:35.449
and encourage them
to learn A.S.L.

22:35.483 --> 22:37.334
Sweetie, I'm not
exactly a model

22:37.368 --> 22:38.669
of connecting with children.

22:38.703 --> 22:40.504
What are you talking about?

22:40.538 --> 22:42.589
Well, I hardly spend
any time with Daphne anymore

22:42.624 --> 22:44.258
now that basketball's over.

22:44.292 --> 22:46.593
Bay is... Bay.

22:46.628 --> 22:49.229
Toby's becoming unreachable.

22:49.264 --> 22:50.697
Nobody gets unadulterated love

22:50.732 --> 22:52.299
from their teenagers.

22:58.156 --> 22:59.156
All right.

22:59.207 --> 23:00.240
I think we're all set.

23:00.274 --> 23:01.458
You can go ahead and go, Meg.

23:01.493 --> 23:02.459
Thanks for coming in.

23:02.494 --> 23:04.127
No problem.

23:04.162 --> 23:05.546
You want me to tell Daphne
to come over and help?

23:05.580 --> 23:07.281
What are you talking about?

23:07.315 --> 23:08.315
Daphne.

23:08.349 --> 23:09.550
Isn't she here to help serve?

23:09.584 --> 23:11.285
Deaf girl, deaf school.

23:13.321 --> 23:16.256
No, that's okay. Thank you.

23:16.291 --> 23:17.291
See you tomorrow.

23:18.326 --> 23:19.359
Wow.

23:19.377 --> 23:21.245
It looks wonderful.

23:21.296 --> 23:23.046
Thank you.

23:23.081 --> 23:26.466
Why is Daphne here?

23:26.501 --> 23:29.069
She's a student here.

23:32.357 --> 23:34.324
Uh, right. ( Chuckles )

23:50.358 --> 23:51.308
Hey!

23:51.359 --> 23:53.227
Oh. Who is Nikki?

23:53.261 --> 23:54.228
Nobody.

23:54.262 --> 23:55.295
Well, the flyer says

23:55.330 --> 23:56.296
"my heart belongs to Jesus,"

23:56.331 --> 23:57.998
but the handwriting says

23:58.032 --> 23:59.132
"everything else
is negotiable."

23:59.167 --> 24:00.234
Bay.

24:00.268 --> 24:01.301
Fine.

24:03.087 --> 24:05.205
So, uh...

24:05.240 --> 24:07.040
You heard about mom and dad

24:07.074 --> 24:09.042
raiding my art studio, right?

24:09.077 --> 24:10.043
( Chuckles )

24:10.078 --> 24:11.345
"Be the Kennish
we know you are."

24:13.081 --> 24:14.848
I'm supposed to help a friend

24:14.883 --> 24:17.251
put up some new pieces,
sort of.

24:17.285 --> 24:19.253
Should I just bail?

24:19.287 --> 24:21.188
Well, you could go see a movie

24:21.222 --> 24:22.823
with Cheves, Burf, and I.

24:22.857 --> 24:24.858
Why would I do that?

24:24.893 --> 24:27.294
Because it would
give you two plus hours

24:27.328 --> 24:28.829
worth of alibi.

24:28.863 --> 24:30.964
You could do whatever you want.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.866
Mm. No... I don't know.

24:32.901 --> 24:34.935
Come on. Don't actually fall

24:34.969 --> 24:37.971
for "operation
make good choices."

24:38.006 --> 24:39.773
It's what they do
when they got nothing left.

24:39.807 --> 24:42.910
They kept giving me
disappointy face.

24:42.944 --> 24:44.111
( Sighs )

24:44.145 --> 24:45.913
Do you know how many times
Wilke and I played

24:45.947 --> 24:46.980
seedy dive bars?

24:47.015 --> 24:49.016
No.

24:49.050 --> 24:51.018
Exactly. Because I always said

24:51.052 --> 24:52.719
that we were playing
coffee shops.

24:52.754 --> 24:54.922
You can't disappoint them

24:54.956 --> 24:56.924
unless they know
you've disappointed them.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.892
Hmm.

25:00.061 --> 25:01.094
Well, in that case,

25:01.129 --> 25:03.964
I have a movie to not see.

25:03.998 --> 25:05.699
( Chuckles )

25:05.733 --> 25:07.834
Hey, you should ditch too.

25:07.869 --> 25:08.869
Give that Nikki girl a call.

25:10.805 --> 25:13.073
I'm not sure about her.

25:13.107 --> 25:15.042
She's pretty church-y.

25:15.076 --> 25:16.710
Hmm.

25:16.744 --> 25:18.078
Well, then there's
a good chance that she won't

25:18.112 --> 25:19.079
sleep with my boyfriend,

25:19.113 --> 25:21.615
so I like her already.

25:21.649 --> 25:23.817
And judging by the way
you're looking at that flyer,

25:23.851 --> 25:24.818
so do you.

25:31.926 --> 25:32.993
Hey.

25:33.011 --> 25:34.928
How's... how's the food?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.834
Yeah. Tapas.

25:40.868 --> 25:43.637
Believe me,
I don't get it either.

25:43.671 --> 25:45.772
So how's work study going?

25:45.790 --> 25:47.874
Are you keeping your grades up?

25:47.909 --> 25:50.827
Yeah. It's great.

25:50.878 --> 25:52.629
That's tough.

25:52.664 --> 25:54.915
I'm impressed.

25:54.949 --> 25:56.616
( Chuckles )

25:56.651 --> 25:57.851
There you are.

26:00.822 --> 26:02.556
Where are your...
where are your parents?

26:07.462 --> 26:09.496
So you came without them?

26:17.722 --> 26:20.474
Just for the food, huh?

26:28.533 --> 26:30.534
Would you excuse me
for one moment?

26:30.585 --> 26:32.419
Sure.

26:35.807 --> 26:38.625
( Sighs )

26:54.575 --> 26:55.542
Uh, chef?

27:00.381 --> 27:02.382
( Giggles )

27:02.400 --> 27:05.152
Did you bring any
of those fried artichokes?

27:05.186 --> 27:07.421
My friend wants to try some.

27:07.455 --> 27:08.588
No, I didn't.

27:08.623 --> 27:10.157
Sorry.

27:30.478 --> 27:32.329
Have you tried acupuncture?

27:32.380 --> 27:35.165
Yes. I didn't notice
much improvement.

27:35.216 --> 27:36.249
Oh, that's terrible.

27:36.283 --> 27:38.135
I am so sorry to interrupt.

27:38.169 --> 27:40.303
Regina, could you do
the A.S.L. Sign-ups?

27:40.338 --> 27:41.354
Oh, sure.

27:41.389 --> 27:43.140
She is the perfect
person to ask.

27:43.191 --> 27:44.257
Regina was such an inspiration

27:44.292 --> 27:45.292
when we were first learning.

27:45.326 --> 27:47.127
Oh, she's an inspiration
to all of us.

27:47.161 --> 27:50.030
Oh, um. Candace,
this is Kathryn Kennish.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.081
Hi.

27:51.115 --> 27:52.432
Oh. You're Daphne's
real mother.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.301
It is so nice to meet you.

27:54.335 --> 27:55.302
I read your book.

27:55.336 --> 27:57.120
It was great. What a story.

27:57.171 --> 27:58.939
Thank you,

27:58.973 --> 28:01.224
but we're both real mothers...

28:01.259 --> 28:02.275
Oh, of course.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.077
I... I'm...

28:04.112 --> 28:07.914
you know, I'm gonna go see
if I can find some recruits.

28:12.286 --> 28:15.205
What if  doesn't show?

28:15.239 --> 28:18.058
Gotta learn some
patience, my friend.

28:20.228 --> 28:21.895
What'd you tell your parents

28:21.929 --> 28:23.063
about where you were?

28:23.097 --> 28:25.198
That I was at the movies.

28:25.233 --> 28:27.200
Hmm.

28:27.235 --> 28:29.202
That's not entirely untrue.

28:29.237 --> 28:30.937
I mean we are sitting here

28:30.972 --> 28:32.839
looking at a picture.

28:32.874 --> 28:34.107
It's just not moving,
that's all.

28:35.877 --> 28:37.144
Do you still
live with your mom?

28:37.178 --> 28:39.112
No. When I turned 18,

28:39.147 --> 28:41.281
she married some loser
and moved out.

28:41.315 --> 28:43.283
There's this, like, graveyard

28:43.317 --> 28:46.987
of abandoned trailers
by the railroad.

28:47.021 --> 28:48.054
I kind of made one my own.

28:48.089 --> 28:49.122
It must be nice, you know,

28:49.157 --> 28:51.725
not to have to
explain to anybody

28:51.759 --> 28:54.861
where you're going
or what you're doing.

28:54.896 --> 28:57.097
I have room for a roommate
if you're looking.

28:57.131 --> 29:00.967
Yeah. That'd be really hard
to explain to my parents.

29:01.002 --> 29:02.169
Come on, you don't
have it so bad.

29:02.203 --> 29:05.005
My folks could never afford
to give me something like that.

29:05.039 --> 29:06.006
Okay, this is not mine.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.674
It's a friend's.

29:07.708 --> 29:08.909
Well, I don't have
any friends who can afford

29:08.943 --> 29:10.110
toys like that, either.

29:10.144 --> 29:13.914
Well, at least
you don't have to lie.

29:13.948 --> 29:15.715
I get really tired
of that sometimes.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.685
So stop lying.

30:05.533 --> 30:07.634
Hey. Hey.

30:07.668 --> 30:09.603
Did you know that Melody
was dating my boss?

30:10.638 --> 30:11.705
Yes.

30:12.773 --> 30:14.874
Well, no one asked me
if I was okay with it.

30:14.909 --> 30:16.943
What happens when
you guys break up

30:16.978 --> 30:18.578
and he takes it out on me?

30:20.815 --> 30:22.549
Because you know him so well.

30:23.618 --> 30:25.452
Um...

30:25.486 --> 30:26.686
Would you excuse us?

30:30.791 --> 30:32.592
( Exhales )

30:32.626 --> 30:35.428
I don't think this is
just about Melody

30:35.446 --> 30:36.563
dating chef.

30:38.432 --> 30:40.400
What else would it be about?

30:40.434 --> 30:41.785
Well, I'm wondering

30:41.869 --> 30:45.505
if maybe you're starting
to have feelings for him?

30:46.574 --> 30:47.841
That's crazy.

30:47.875 --> 30:48.842
Why would you think that?

30:50.678 --> 30:52.579
All the pretty
new clothes for work,

30:52.613 --> 30:55.315
all the time
spent getting ready

30:55.349 --> 30:56.383
before you go in?

30:56.417 --> 30:58.535
We have to go
to my history class.

30:58.569 --> 31:00.370
They'll be closing up soon.

31:00.404 --> 31:01.538
What... honey.

31:01.572 --> 31:02.622
( Sighs )

31:02.657 --> 31:04.624
It's nothing
to be ashamed about.

31:04.659 --> 31:07.594
I do not have a crush on chef.

31:09.463 --> 31:10.597
Well, good.

31:10.631 --> 31:12.666
Because he's totally
inappropriate for you.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.335
He's too old, he's your boss,

31:15.369 --> 31:16.569
and judging by how quickly

31:16.604 --> 31:17.637
he and Melody got together...

31:17.672 --> 31:19.322
you're talking too fast.

31:19.357 --> 31:20.490
I can't read your lips.

31:31.925 --> 31:33.492
Okay.

31:33.527 --> 31:35.661
My butt's numb. I think
I got bit by something.

31:35.696 --> 31:37.496
Are there chiggers out
this time of year?

31:52.479 --> 31:54.347
Okay, we need to get him
to turn around.

32:01.838 --> 32:02.788
Hey, douche bag!

32:04.491 --> 32:06.325
Zarra, what are you doing?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.310
Zarra!

32:07.344 --> 32:08.661
One little question,

32:08.695 --> 32:10.479
so you just come here

32:10.514 --> 32:12.365
and mark all over
someone else's work

32:12.399 --> 32:13.632
like some sorry ass dog?

32:13.650 --> 32:15.501
Yeah. What's it to you, huh?

32:16.637 --> 32:18.437
Uh, this is my piece, jackass.

32:18.455 --> 32:20.256
How about you get out
of my way, all right?

32:20.290 --> 32:21.740
( Scoffs )

32:21.758 --> 32:24.260
Yo. Hey!

32:24.294 --> 32:27.294
- The hell do you think you're doing?, huh?
- I told you to get out of here.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.549
Get out!

32:30.584 --> 32:31.550
( Grunts )

32:32.719 --> 32:33.719
Crap.

32:33.737 --> 32:35.321
Hey!

32:36.356 --> 32:37.556
Hey.

32:39.259 --> 32:40.242
Get out of here, dude.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.377
- Yo.
- I'm gonna cut him.

32:41.411 --> 32:42.378
What are you doing?

32:42.412 --> 32:43.362
What? You want to go?

32:43.380 --> 32:44.413
- Whoa. Chill!
- I'll go!

32:44.464 --> 32:46.215
You're not gonna
diss my work again.

32:46.249 --> 32:47.500
- Get out of here!
- Crazy bitch, yo.

32:47.534 --> 32:49.218
All right, get out of here!

32:49.269 --> 32:50.519
You slash my piece
one more time,

32:50.554 --> 32:52.405
I will mess you up!

32:53.473 --> 32:55.274
What the hell are you thinking?

32:55.308 --> 32:56.275
You were gonna cut him?

32:56.309 --> 32:58.110
With what?!

32:58.144 --> 32:59.278
Paint scraper. ( Chuckles )

33:00.447 --> 33:02.081
A paint scraper?

33:02.115 --> 33:04.450
Are you insane?
What if he went after you?

33:04.484 --> 33:06.352
( Chuckles )
I'd have been screwed.

33:06.386 --> 33:08.120
Okay, you know what?
You called him out

33:08.155 --> 33:09.221
on everything.

33:09.256 --> 33:11.223
Oh my... and "hey,
you want to go?

33:11.258 --> 33:13.392
- Let's go!"
- He's like "crazy bitch."

33:13.427 --> 33:15.111
He was so scared.
Did you see that?

33:15.145 --> 33:17.063
- It was so cool.
- ( Laughing )

33:17.097 --> 33:18.114
Oh, man.

33:21.234 --> 33:24.086
Um, I can drive you home

33:24.121 --> 33:26.071
if you... if you need.

33:29.409 --> 33:30.476
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.179
You... you and Daphne
are going out?

33:38.385 --> 33:40.252
Bowling, huh?

33:50.380 --> 33:53.032
I'm going to trust
that you just said

33:53.066 --> 33:55.067
you're going to be
a perfect gentleman

33:55.102 --> 33:56.869
when you're out
with my daughter.

33:58.939 --> 34:00.906
Mm-hmm. You'd better be.

34:05.278 --> 34:07.279
Bye.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.801
Emmett.

34:11.851 --> 34:13.185
Nice to see you.

34:18.024 --> 34:20.993
I think I'll go see
if Melody needs some help.

34:24.246 --> 34:25.831
Hello! Hello hello!

34:25.866 --> 34:26.916
Attention everyone.

34:26.949 --> 34:28.199
Come up to the stage.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.920
Thanks for coming.
Come on up to the front.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.891
Rose: <i>Thank you all
for coming tonight.</i>

34:35.942 --> 34:40.196
It's wonderful to see
so many people here.

34:40.230 --> 34:43.849
A special thank you
to our organizers,

34:43.884 --> 34:45.184
Melody Bledsoe

34:47.070 --> 34:49.021
and Kathryn Kennish.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.907
Thank you. Thank you.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.743
Oh! And a special thank you

34:54.795 --> 34:57.763
to chef Jeff Reycraft

34:57.798 --> 34:59.031
and maize restaurant

34:59.065 --> 35:01.801
for the fantastic food, huh?

35:02.969 --> 35:05.171
- Thank you.
- <i>Well, good night everyone.</i>

35:05.205 --> 35:08.140
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>our magazine drive</i>

35:08.175 --> 35:10.075
<i>starts next week.</i>

35:10.110 --> 35:13.095
<i>So subscribe and help</i>
<i>support our school.</i>

35:13.146 --> 35:14.980
Can you help
clean up over there?

35:15.015 --> 35:16.065
Thanks.

35:16.099 --> 35:19.051
Kathryn, have you seen Daphne?

35:19.085 --> 35:20.986
Uh, she went back
to the restaurant to help.

35:21.021 --> 35:23.722
I assumed you'd okayed it.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.891
Right. I forgot.
I'll see you at home.

35:25.926 --> 35:27.760
Wait, Regina.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.762
I know how hard
it's been for you

35:29.796 --> 35:31.730
not signing at home
with Daphne.

35:31.765 --> 35:33.132
- We're fine.
- And if the reason

35:33.166 --> 35:35.134
you haven't gone
to see Dr. Fuller

35:35.168 --> 35:36.869
- is financial...
- Stop.

35:36.903 --> 35:39.004
Look, I'm not trying
to offend...

35:39.039 --> 35:41.106
Kathryn, stop.

35:42.175 --> 35:43.909
Not that it's any
of your business,

35:43.944 --> 35:45.110
but I did go see Dr. Fuller,

35:45.145 --> 35:46.745
and he told me the same thing

35:46.780 --> 35:47.980
that my doctor has been
telling me for months.

35:48.014 --> 35:49.815
There's no magic bullet.

35:49.850 --> 35:51.016
It just takes time to heal.

35:51.051 --> 35:52.785
I'm sorry.

35:52.819 --> 35:55.688
- I was just trying to...
- I know what you were trying to do,

35:55.722 --> 35:57.156
and I need you to stop.

35:57.190 --> 36:00.025
Do you honestly think
that if there was anything

36:00.060 --> 36:01.794
that would help me
to communicate with Daphne

36:01.828 --> 36:03.095
the way that we used to,
that I wouldn't move

36:03.129 --> 36:05.164
heaven and earth or grovel
to you for the money

36:05.198 --> 36:06.699
in order to make that happen?

36:17.646 --> 36:18.746
John: <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

36:18.781 --> 36:19.847
Bye. Bye.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.753
What are you doing here?

36:31.894 --> 36:34.595
Uh, Daphne went
to the restaurant

36:34.630 --> 36:35.596
to help.

36:42.938 --> 36:44.539
Oh.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.542
Oh, is that right?

36:47.576 --> 36:49.460
Hey, hey. Whoa whoa whoa.

36:49.495 --> 36:51.629
Um, I can drive you
home if you want?

36:54.850 --> 36:56.551
You know what?
I got a better idea.

36:56.585 --> 36:57.618
Why don't you and I

36:57.653 --> 36:58.920
go to the batting cages?

37:00.656 --> 37:02.657
Yeah. I know the owner.

37:02.691 --> 37:03.825
He'll let us in.

37:05.761 --> 37:07.628
Hey, no no. Hey, hey, hey.

37:07.663 --> 37:08.629
Not just for you.

37:12.735 --> 37:14.602
Come on.

37:20.776 --> 37:23.494
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't understand that.

37:30.719 --> 37:32.887
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:32.921 --> 37:35.590
Sorry to bother you,
but did, um...

37:35.624 --> 37:36.791
Daphne tell you what time
she was coming home?

37:36.825 --> 37:38.559
She's not answering my texts.

37:38.594 --> 37:40.561
No, she didn't

37:40.596 --> 37:41.562
thanks.

37:41.597 --> 37:43.865
Look, to be totally honest,

37:43.899 --> 37:46.601
Daphne didn't tell me
she was going back to work.

37:46.635 --> 37:48.770
She only told you.

37:49.872 --> 37:52.540
Well, she left in a hurry
if that's any help.

37:54.877 --> 37:56.577
I feel like I'm
losing touch with Daphne

37:56.612 --> 37:57.879
and I took it out on you,
and I'm sorry.

37:59.715 --> 38:00.915
( Sighs )

38:00.949 --> 38:03.484
Me too.

38:03.519 --> 38:04.919
Maybe I've overstepped.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.688
( Sighs ) It's okay.

38:07.723 --> 38:08.823
I know you mean well.

38:11.527 --> 38:12.727
Want some tea?

38:12.761 --> 38:14.896
Sure. Thanks.

38:17.866 --> 38:20.735
We just found out that Bay's
been doing street art

38:20.769 --> 38:23.571
for the past two years.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.506
What do you mean?

38:25.541 --> 38:26.641
Spray paint,

38:26.675 --> 38:28.543
sneaking out,

38:28.577 --> 38:29.944
putting up illegal paintings

38:29.978 --> 38:32.814
on walls all over the city.

38:32.848 --> 38:33.848
Wow.

38:36.919 --> 38:38.653
( Chuckles ) You didn't know?

38:38.687 --> 38:40.855
I just assumed

38:40.889 --> 38:43.858
she talking to you
about things like that.

38:43.892 --> 38:45.693
Not this time.

38:45.727 --> 38:46.744
Want to sit down?

38:46.778 --> 38:48.496
Sure.

38:50.565 --> 38:52.450
Here you go.

38:52.501 --> 38:54.836
So what'd you do?

38:54.870 --> 38:57.605
We appealed to her better self,

38:57.639 --> 38:59.874
her sense of right and wrong.

38:59.908 --> 39:01.909
Bold move.

39:03.545 --> 39:04.712
( Sighs ) Sometimes I hate

39:04.746 --> 39:05.780
that they're growing up.

39:05.814 --> 39:07.882
You are so much easier
to compete with

39:07.916 --> 39:08.883
than adulthood.

39:08.917 --> 39:11.819
( Laughs )

39:11.854 --> 39:12.954
Well, hey, Bay.

39:12.988 --> 39:14.755
How was the movie?

39:17.526 --> 39:18.626
I didn't go to the movies.

39:19.962 --> 39:22.763
I want to be the person
that you raised me to be,

39:22.798 --> 39:24.732
but I'm also the person
that I was born to be.

39:24.766 --> 39:25.933
I'm an artist.

39:25.968 --> 39:29.670
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to lie to you anymore.</i>

39:31.607 --> 39:33.507
But I'm also not gonna stop

39:33.542 --> 39:34.709
doing street art.

39:38.881 --> 39:40.548
Good night.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.729
Hey, ninja.

39:54.763 --> 39:56.564
You slip in, you slip out

39:56.598 --> 39:57.932
under cover of darkness.

39:57.966 --> 39:59.533
You seemed busy.

39:59.568 --> 40:00.668
Oh, chatty group.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.637
Will you come back?

40:02.671 --> 40:04.538
I'm thinking about it.

40:06.575 --> 40:07.575
So, uh...

40:07.609 --> 40:09.710
You want to hang out?

40:09.745 --> 40:10.978
Maybe go to the Plaza
or something?

40:11.013 --> 40:14.682
I'm not much of a Plaza girl.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.717
I always get too cold

40:16.752 --> 40:18.686
and nobody ever sits down.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.688
Well, I know a warm coffee shop

40:20.722 --> 40:21.756
with lots of chairs.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.558
- ( Chuckles )
- How are you at backgammon?

40:24.593 --> 40:26.694
You are so gonna regret this.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.897
I am awesome at backgammon.

40:29.932 --> 40:31.832
I'll be right back.

40:31.867 --> 40:34.001
No ninja action while I'm gone.

40:52.888 --> 40:53.955
Daphne.

40:57.759 --> 40:58.759
What are you doing here?

40:58.794 --> 41:02.563
I need to know what's going on.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.566
I was just putting stuff away

41:05.600 --> 41:07.001
and getting ready to go home.

41:08.737 --> 41:10.738
That's not what I mean.

41:13.842 --> 41:14.942
You're in high school.

41:14.977 --> 41:16.711
So?

41:16.745 --> 41:18.746
I thought you were in college.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.848
Why would you think that?

41:20.882 --> 41:24.552
I never looked
at your application.

41:24.586 --> 41:26.020
You getting hired
was a done deal.

41:26.054 --> 41:29.590
I heard "student," I met you.

41:31.693 --> 41:34.562
I assumed you were in college.

41:34.596 --> 41:37.732
So now you don't
like me anymore?

41:37.766 --> 41:39.734
No, that's...

41:39.768 --> 41:40.901
that's not the point.

41:40.936 --> 41:42.570
It is to me.

41:44.773 --> 41:47.975
Plus, you're my employee.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.745
It didn't matter the other
night in the parking lot.

41:50.779 --> 41:53.781
<i>♪ I can't sleep</i>
<i>without you anymore... ♪</i>

41:53.815 --> 41:54.915
Well, it should have.

41:54.950 --> 41:57.585
You have to look at me
when you're talking.

41:57.619 --> 42:00.521
<i>♪ Listen to the lullaby...</i>

42:00.555 --> 42:02.623
I want this to happen.

42:10.699 --> 42:14.702
