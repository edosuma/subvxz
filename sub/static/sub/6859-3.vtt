[Cackles] We meet again.

12:46.638 --> 12:50.024
I must admit, you were more difficult

12:50.026 --> 12:51.492
to capture than I anticipated,

12:51.522 --> 12:52.395
prince.

12:52.515 --> 12:53.948
You have my respect

12:53.950 --> 12:56.450
as hunter to his prey.

12:56.452 --> 12:57.551
I do not seek,

Your people?

13:05.561 --> 13:07.461
You're mistaken, prince.

13:07.463 --> 13:08.762
They are my people

13:08.764 --> 13:10.531
and under my rule.

13:10.533 --> 13:12.600
They, like you,

13:12.602 --> 13:15.903
are nothing more than slaves.

13:15.905 --> 13:17.371
Your rule is not recognized

My people are all those

who live in these seas,

13:21.277 --> 13:23.077
whether they be Mon Cala

13:23.079 --> 13:26.046
or Quarren.

13:26.048 --> 13:27.948
Surely you have not come here

13:27.950 --> 13:31.385
seeking the aid of Nossor Ri.

13:31.387 --> 13:32.219
Do you really think he would

13:32.221 --> 13:34.688
trade his position to join you?

13:34.690 --> 13:35.756
The Quarren are already

13:35.758 --> 13:36.690
slaves,

13:36.692 --> 13:38.225
though they may not see it.

13:38.227 --> 13:40.594
Nossor Ri, you knew my father.

Whatever differences our people

13:42.131 --> 13:43.230
had in the past,

surely you must know we can

work together to make

13:46.002 --> 13:47.368
Mon Cala whole.

13:47.370 --> 13:48.802
Dooku and Tamson want only

13:48.804 --> 13:50.571
to exploit us and leave our

13:50.573 --> 13:52.406
cities broken and our resources

13:52.408 --> 13:53.774
depleted.

13:53.776 --> 13:54.742
What will then be left

13:54.744 --> 13:56.577
for the Quarren?

13:56.579 --> 13:57.945
Well, Nossor Ri?

What good would their help

14:08.457 --> 14:10.124

14:10.126 --> 14:11.592
The Quarren are more gutless

14:11.594 --> 14:13.460
than your people.

14:13.462 --> 14:14.728
As long as I live,

14:25.274 --> 14:27.274
your public execution.
