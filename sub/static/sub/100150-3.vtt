00:07.216 --> 00:10.177
(car engine roaring)

00:22.898 --> 00:25.484
For some reason, I keep thinking
about your wedding.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.280
You in Mom's dress.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.115
John in his uniform.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.327
Back then, I thought
the world of him.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.331
The world changed.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.884
(rain pattering)

00:54.972 --> 00:56.974

01:17.953 --> 01:19.955

(rain pattering)

03:22.870 --> 03:24.830
-Hey.
-(door slams)

03:24.872 --> 03:26.957
What's going on?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.751
Nothing.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.085
(chuckling):
Okay.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.754
Just hold on a second, okay?

03:31.795 --> 03:34.798
Someone calls me up
asking me to borrow a gun...

03:34.840 --> 03:36.467
I got to ask a couple questions.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.968
Okay.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.762
What happened, Julia?

03:39.803 --> 03:41.764
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.807
Look, uh...

03:45.851 --> 03:47.353
I don't want
to get into your business.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.980
-I appreciate that.
-But this is a small town.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.107
The sheriff and I
go hunting together.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.485
Not long after
you showed up shot,

03:54.526 --> 03:57.988
he told me he looked into you.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.824
And yeah, there was
a Juliana Crain

04:00.866 --> 04:03.410
from San Francisco, but...

04:03.452 --> 04:06.538
she died in that car crash
right alongside her parents.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.041
I don't know your story
and I don't need to know.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.043
I like you, mysteries and all.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.088
And I want to help, but...

04:14.129 --> 04:16.256
you got to tell me
what you're up against.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.259
Nazis from another universe.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.642
Well, one pistol's
not gonna do it.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.186
Nope. (chuckling):
I'm afraid not.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.939
Listen, I'm sorry I called you,

04:31.981 --> 04:34.108
I, um... I'll figure it out.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.026
I'm sure there's a pawn shop
where I can find one.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.486
Whoa.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.697
Those pawn shop guns

04:39.738 --> 04:42.032
are apt to blow up
in your hand.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.909
JULIANA:
Not unless the barrel's plugged.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.703
Careful; it's loaded.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.081
Thank you.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.209
Looks like you know
how it works.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.878
I do, yeah.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.588
(exhales)
Just promise me you'll call

04:56.630 --> 04:59.383
if there's every any...
real trouble.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.803
Thank you.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.723
(door opens)

05:09.476 --> 05:11.478
(seagulls squawking)

05:23.240 --> 05:25.576
KIDO:
Mingus Jones had an alibi.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.494
Dead men do not have alibis.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.497
According to his travel records,
he was not in San Francisco

05:30.539 --> 05:32.374
the night
of the Tagomi assassination.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.836
These kokujin radicals
know how to forge documents.

05:35.878 --> 05:39.048
Chief Inspector,
you already have your killer.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.675
With respect,
I do not think we do.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.052
Close the case now.

05:47.056 --> 05:50.893
I know I have no reason
to doubt your commitment.

05:52.728 --> 05:55.939
You have my absolute loyalty,
General.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.610
WYATT:
Pablo, give us

05:59.651 --> 06:00.944
the exits again.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.155
Front door, back door,
three side doors.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.574
Seven windows
in the first floor.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.242
-Kent, stations?
-KENT: Station one.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.536
Back wall of the main room
during the auction.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.497
Two, firearms in the basement.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.540
Three,
position for flanking maneuver

06:13.582 --> 06:14.958
on interior guards.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.461
Four, Elijah and his team
cover us during retreat.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.671
(guard speaks indistinctly)

06:19.713 --> 06:22.341
WYATT:
Good. Till then,
we are humble servers.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.219
Right? Respectful, low profile.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.429
And any of you fuckers
forget to bow,

06:27.471 --> 06:29.389
I'll kick your teeth in.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.141
(Wyatt chuckles)

06:32.184 --> 06:33.727
WYATT:
Ah, this is a tough one.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.646
Four targets, dozen guards,
surrounded by

06:35.687 --> 06:36.980
a hundred civilians.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.942
(guards speaking indistinctly)

06:39.983 --> 06:43.612
WYATT:
Listen. I got a box.

06:43.654 --> 06:47.116
For any operation like this,
I open it up.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.619
Everything that happens inside
this mansion tonight,

06:50.661 --> 06:53.205
it all goes in the fucking box.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.041
You understand?
And when it's over...

06:58.293 --> 07:00.921
I close the box.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.923
(guards speaking Japanese)

07:02.965 --> 07:05.384
And I don't open it again
until the next time.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.387
What happens when the box
is all full up?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.430
(indistinct radio chatter)

07:11.473 --> 07:13.392
(guard grunts)

07:15.435 --> 07:17.146
WYATT:
Hey, everybody pass up
their papers.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.397
(guard speaking faintly)

07:18.438 --> 07:20.566

07:22.067 --> 07:23.527

08:46.818 --> 08:48.153
Mm.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.821
-Hi.
-(footsteps approaching)

08:49.863 --> 08:51.823
Hi, Jennifer.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.661
Hello, Mrs. Smith.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.497
-Welcome back.
-Thank you, Bridget.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.374
AMY:
Mom, the Fuhrer's coming
for dinner tomorrow night.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.626
-At our house.
-Is he?

09:02.668 --> 09:03.961
SMITH:
Amy, um...

09:05.254 --> 09:08.090
...uh, your mother and I
would like a moment.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.092
Come on, girls.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.975
-Let me help you.
-I'm fine.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.979
So, you must be exhausted.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.691
Listen, uh...

09:25.732 --> 09:28.110
thought maybe I'd take
the girls to a movie tonight.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.487
Give you some time alone.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.489
Himmler's coming tomorrow?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.617
I've hired caterers;
you don't need to be here.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.578
Will Margarete be here?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.331
I believe so, yes.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.500
Well, then, I'd like to be here.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.752
She and I have always
gotten along well.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.922
We'll talk later.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.090
I'm gonna get changed.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.310
(helicopters whirring
in distance)

10:36.428 --> 10:38.388
(light knocking on door)

10:38.430 --> 10:41.058
-Just a minute, John.
-(door opens)

10:41.099 --> 10:42.601
JENNIFER:
Mom?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.145
Hey.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.814
-Come on in, it's...
-Why'd you come back?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.779
I had to.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.323
-No, you didn't. You were free.
-No, I-I had to be here

10:56.365 --> 10:59.242
-for you and Amy.
-I didn't ask you to do that.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.661
You didn't have to.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.414
My baby.

11:04.456 --> 11:08.293
One day, when you have
kids of your own,

11:08.335 --> 11:12.089
I hope that you understand
the choices I've made.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.132
"Kids of my own"?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.551
(chuckles):
I know.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.222
I hated when my mom
used to say that to me.

11:22.265 --> 11:27.646
But now I hear myself say it
to you and I hear her voice,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.732
and I miss her.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.193
I don't want to stay here.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.487
-Jennifer...
-I could go live
with Uncle Hank on my own.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.906
-We've been out there before,
we know where it is..
-Stop it, stop it.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.534
You can't talk like that
anymore, not even in this house.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.577
Why not?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.704
Who's listening?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.875
Someday, I'm going
to get out of here.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.877
I'm gonna live my own life.

11:54.423 --> 11:58.009
Someday, I'll help you.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.471
JULIANA:
"Wei Chi."

12:02.722 --> 12:06.726
"Fire over water."

12:06.768 --> 12:09.396
What's not complete?

12:13.817 --> 12:15.777
(gun clicks)

12:19.281 --> 12:21.950
ALT-THOMAS:
Juliana?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.786
Thomas.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.539
Just a-just a second.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.423
Hi.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.592
Your lesson.
It's Thursday, isn't it?

12:38.633 --> 12:41.094
-Guess you forgot?
-I'm sorry.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.512
-Here, come in.
-Oh, if you're busy,

12:42.554 --> 12:44.181
-I-- it's no real problem.
-No, no, no.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.349
-Come on.
-I may not be around

12:46.391 --> 12:47.767
for much longer, anyway.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.770
Not gonna be around?
Where are you going?

12:50.812 --> 12:52.981
Well, a group of us guys

12:53.023 --> 12:54.816
have been talking about
joining the Marines.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.735
You know, they've been
stepping up their enlistment

12:56.776 --> 12:58.487
since the attack
in the Tonkin Gulf.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.740
My recruiter says he can get me
into boot camp right away.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.367
I might even see some action
in ten weeks.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.745
Wow.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.080
Why don't you put that down?

13:09.122 --> 13:12.042
Come and sit with me
for a second.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.503
You know, there's a lot
of people here

13:14.544 --> 13:16.922
who love you and care about you.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.509
Have you talked
to your parents about this?

13:20.550 --> 13:22.177
(exhales)

13:22.219 --> 13:24.471
Well, my dad doesn't like
to talk about the war.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.847
Mm-hmm.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.474
And I already know
what my mother will say.

13:27.516 --> 13:30.310
But somebody's got to push back
against the Reds.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.313
You know that every young man
thinks he's the one

13:33.355 --> 13:34.773
who's gonna come back from war.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.358
Yeah, well, my dad
came back from war.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.485
Thomas, there are
very few things in this world

13:38.527 --> 13:40.779
worth dying for,
even fewer worth killing for.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.197
You do understand that?

13:42.239 --> 13:45.116
-Yeah.
-Those things do exist.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.785
But when there's something
truly worth fighting for,

13:46.826 --> 13:48.787
you're gonna know it.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.081
Trust me.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.124
(indistinct chatter)

14:07.889 --> 14:10.141
We got eyes on him
coming off the plane.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.977
Is everybody ready?

14:12.018 --> 14:15.605
LEON:
Let's go butcher us a Butcher.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.858
Everybody, bring it in,
gather round.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.902
Bell?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.491
(clears throat)

14:28.910 --> 14:32.205
BELL:
"If we must die,

14:32.247 --> 14:36.209

"...oh, let us nobly die,

14:59.149 --> 15:04.738
"so that our precious blood
may not be shed in vain;

15:04.779 --> 15:08.158
"then even the monsters we defy

15:08.199 --> 15:10.452
"shall be constrained

15:10.493 --> 15:13.580
"to honor us though dead.

15:13.622 --> 15:17.917
"What though before us
lies the open grave?

15:17.959 --> 15:23.465
"Like men, we'll face the
murderous, cowardly pack...

15:24.924 --> 15:27.427
"...pressed to the wall,
dying...

15:29.304 --> 15:31.723
...but fighting back."

15:39.773 --> 15:43.526
-Masuda's here.
-Roger that.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.570
-You know, I could
take him out right now.
-Mm-mm.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.906
BELL:
We need all four of them.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.039
Masuda Taishoh.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.295
General Masuda, what an honor.

16:02.337 --> 16:06.716
We've heard so much about
your decisive work in China.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.177
Has Colonel Kido arrived?

16:09.219 --> 16:12.597
Uh... not yet, no.
We expect him shortly.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.892
Uh, please enjoy the authentic
American music and cuisine,

16:15.934 --> 16:20.271
and, uh, feel free to examine
the auction...

16:20.313 --> 16:22.357
(phone ringing)

16:24.359 --> 16:26.528
-Moshi moshi.
-OFFICER: I have a call
for you, sir.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.364
Take a note, Officer.
I am already late for an event.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.366
It's the yakuza boss, sir.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.368
-Okami?
-Yes, sir.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.912
Put him through.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.335
This man attacked him?

16:42.377 --> 16:44.045
OKAMI:
No. He merely asked him

16:44.087 --> 16:45.505
to leave.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.800
You son responded
like a rabid dog.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.927
After he did this,

16:50.969 --> 16:53.596
he sat down and poured
another drink.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.435
At first, we did not know
he was your son.

16:58.476 --> 17:02.605
The only reason he is still
alive is the uniform he wore,

17:02.647 --> 17:04.399
and the medal on his chest.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.859
The Kinshi Kunsho.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.447
I would not kill a war hero.

17:44.647 --> 17:49.027
Okay, well, have fun
at the movies, girls.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.488
Bridget, no later than 9:00 p.m.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.159
-Bye.
-Behave.
-Bye, Dad.

18:20.225 --> 18:25.313
I think you and me need to have
a very frank conversation.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.357
So do I.

18:37.909 --> 18:41.329
I don't think you should be
at the dinner tomorrow night.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.790
The Fuhrer will know I'm back.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.792
-He'll wonder where I am.
-I can handle him.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.128
I'm sure you could, but
my absence will raise questions.

18:49.170 --> 18:53.007
The evening is too important to
leave anything to chance, Helen.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.843
You and I both know
if it were up to you,

18:54.884 --> 18:57.095
the evening wouldn't be
happening at all, John.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.556
You don't have a choice.

19:06.813 --> 19:11.234
A lot has changed for me
in the last year.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.988
But I'm clear now.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.448
-I know what matters.
-And what matters?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.075
-My daughters.
-Well, they've come back

19:19.117 --> 19:21.327
with some very
dangerous ideas, Helen.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.288
I know, and I've spoken
with Jennifer.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.374
I think it's gonna take
a little more than that.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.839
And then there's us.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.470
You tell me your feelings
have changed.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.682
Okay.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.351
You think you're the only one?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
No.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.032
So why pretend?

19:59.073 --> 20:01.034
I'm not pretending.

20:01.075 --> 20:05.872
I don't know if there's anything
left in this marriage, John,

20:05.914 --> 20:09.292
but one thing
has always been true of us.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.086
We don't lie to each other.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.547
So believe me now.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.174
I won't be coming
as your wife tomorrow night,

20:16.215 --> 20:19.177
I will be coming as your ally.

20:19.218 --> 20:24.265
And trust me, you will need one.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.436
(birds singing)

20:31.105 --> 20:33.107
BELL:
Shimura, check.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.986
Nagasaki, check.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.198
CHILDAN:
Shimura-sama,

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
Nagasaki-sama.

20:47.497 --> 20:51.209
♪ Drifting along
with the tumbling ♪

20:51.250 --> 20:54.253
♪ Tumbleweeds... ♪

21:16.150 --> 21:18.444
Shimura, sir. Nagasaki, sir.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.446
Please let me know if there is
anything I can do for you.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.698
Thank you very much.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.327
Please enjoy the event.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.829
Thank you.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.346
Wait!

21:45.388 --> 21:47.557
You! You.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.396
Taste everything.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.427
(indistinct chatter)

22:31.267 --> 22:33.144
We got eight guards out front.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.771
Three more in
the communications tent.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.441
Another seven,
maybe eight more stationed

22:38.483 --> 22:40.026
out back and in the house.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.319
BELL:
That's more than we thought.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.820
Yeah, but we'll be all right.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.238
BELL:
Snipers in position.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.782
R1 in position.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.326
-R2 in position.
-R3 in position.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.370
No sign of Kido.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.457
(grunts)

22:58.544 --> 23:00.254
There will be no report.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.049
The incident will be forgotten,
but it cannot happen again.

23:04.801 --> 23:09.305
(panting)
I can't forget.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.808
I can't forget what I've done.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.060
What? What have you done?

23:17.522 --> 23:20.691
What my unit did in Manchuria.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.736
To the villagers.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.417
It was war.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.253
It is in the past.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.381
I can still hear their voices.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.175
You did those things
for your country.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.427
You have no reason
to be ashamed.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.179
It is not shame that I feel.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.390
Something more than shame.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.684
We must look forward now,

23:54.725 --> 23:57.770
and draw our strength
from the Empire.

23:57.812 --> 24:00.565
The Empire.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.901
The Empire is not strong.
The Empire is losing.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.486
Losing?

24:06.195 --> 24:08.072
In China.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.908
The TV says we are winning
there, but it is a lie.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.077
-Enough.
-We believe what we're told.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.412
We don't ask questions.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.623
I was not a soldier.

24:17.665 --> 24:21.002
You are not a detective.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.837
We are both puppets.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.464
I will not be spoken to
this way.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.759
We are bound to our duty.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.345
Duty?

24:32.889 --> 24:35.433
And what of your duty
to your family?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.686
You left us.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.608
No! No!

24:43.649 --> 24:45.234
(grunts)

24:49.113 --> 24:51.157
Get out of this house.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.075
(panting)

24:54.118 --> 24:56.120
-Stand up.
-(grunts)

25:03.002 --> 25:05.171
You are not my son.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.179
(applause)

25:13.221 --> 25:15.473
(indistinct chatter)

25:15.514 --> 25:18.100
And now for our first item
of the evening...

25:18.142 --> 25:19.936
(translates into Japanese)

25:19.977 --> 25:22.939
...this white ten-gallon hat

25:22.980 --> 25:24.941
worn by Gene Autry

25:24.982 --> 25:27.568
in the film Melody Ranch.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.279
(Yukiko translating)

25:34.158 --> 25:35.576
CHILDAN:
Miss Uedo will start the bidding

25:35.618 --> 25:37.370
at 20,000 yen.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.220
-Sold!
-Congratulations, Takaki-sama.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.890
(speaking Japanese)

25:59.809 --> 26:01.852
Excuse me.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.982
-(grunting)
-(neck cracks)

26:23.082 --> 26:24.333
Got the signal.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.085
Kido still isn't here.

26:26.127 --> 26:29.005
Forget him.
We're going in now.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.732
(Yukiko translating
in distance)

26:55.531 --> 26:59.035
(Yukiko continues translating
in distance)

27:05.166 --> 27:07.126
(muffled voices from other room)

27:07.168 --> 27:09.170
(applause, cheers in distance)

27:12.340 --> 27:15.009
CHILDAN;
This is an authentic headdress

27:15.051 --> 27:17.678
owned and worn
by American Horse...

27:17.720 --> 27:19.221
(Yukiko translating)

27:23.893 --> 27:24.977
(low, indistinct chatter)

27:25.019 --> 27:26.354
CHILDAN:
...the fierce

27:26.395 --> 27:28.356
and noble Indian,
famous for his role

27:28.397 --> 27:31.817
in the Great Sioux War of 1876.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.652
(Yukiko translating)

27:35.988 --> 27:39.325
CHILDAN: One can imagine him
wearing this stunning item

27:39.367 --> 27:41.869
while charging
across the Black Hills

27:41.911 --> 27:43.245
of South Dakota.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.247
(Yukiko translating)

27:48.292 --> 27:51.087
CHILDAN: Truly a treasure
to value for decades to come.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.632
Miss Uedo will start the bidding
at 20,000 yen.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.634
20,000. Thank you very much.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.677
Will anyone bid 20,000?

27:58.719 --> 28:00.429
Mr. Yamaguchi,
thank you very much.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.807
Will anyone pay 30,000?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.642
Mr. Miyagawa,
thank you very much.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.144
We have 40,000?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.397
Mr. Yamaguchi,
thank you very much.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.858
Chief Inspector.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.819
I have the incident report
you requested.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.488
The dead body
behind the Bamboo Palace.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.490
I also brought the transcript

28:19.532 --> 28:21.826
of a interview we conducted
this afternoon

28:21.867 --> 28:23.702
with the gaijin informant.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.580
We have reached 60,000 yen.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.498
80,000.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.666

-General Masuda.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.667
80,000 yen.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.252
Thank you very much.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.631
The gaijin informant claims
to have seen Lemuel Washington

28:35.673 --> 28:37.675
back in San Francisco.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.468
Perhaps...

28:39.510 --> 28:42.263
he is connected to the BCR.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.348
When? (sighs)

28:44.390 --> 28:46.475
Two nights ago,
leaving a house

28:46.517 --> 28:48.644
at the intersection
of Clayton and Parnassus.

28:48.686 --> 28:50.187
He was with someone.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.231
Caucasian male.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.482
Same age.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.067
Irish accent.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.699
The caterers are Resistance.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.786
Will anyone pay 90,000?

29:07.663 --> 29:09.206
Emergency! Emergency!

29:09.248 --> 29:10.416
Stop the auction!

29:10.458 --> 29:12.585
Those gaijin caterers
are resistance!

29:12.626 --> 29:14.086
Kempeitai vehicles
are on the way!

29:14.128 --> 29:17.214
-(silenced gunshots)
-Those gaijin caterers
are resistance!

29:18.591 --> 29:20.718
90,000 yen. Anyone?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.511
We're blown.

29:22.553 --> 29:23.637
Kempeitai know
about the caterers.

29:23.679 --> 29:24.722
They're on their way.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.974
Abort the mission.
Get out of the van now.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.392
Shit.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.019
How's Wyatt getting out?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.520
It's too late for that.
We need to split.

29:31.562 --> 29:32.771
-Get our people out fast.
-Shit.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.859
Three.

29:36.901 --> 29:37.985
Two.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.236
One.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.113

29:54.793 --> 29:57.379
(gunshots, shouting continue)

29:59.798 --> 30:01.467
Shit. We can't leave them.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.010
Snipers, engage.

30:05.346 --> 30:06.388
(gunshots)

30:10.267 --> 30:11.977
Yukiko!

30:12.019 --> 30:14.104

30:14.146 --> 30:15.856
(man grunts)

30:15.898 --> 30:17.274
(woman crying)

30:21.862 --> 30:23.948
It's Masuda.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.533
BELL:
Take the shot.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.034
Take the shot!

30:28.452 --> 30:29.578

30:29.620 --> 30:31.997

automatic gunfire)

30:36.252 --> 30:37.711

30:37.753 --> 30:39.421
Shit!

30:41.423 --> 30:45.177
Bell. Bell, don't go out there,
all right? Bell!

30:45.219 --> 30:46.845
Don't go out there!

30:46.887 --> 30:48.889

31:09.702 --> 31:11.620

31:11.662 --> 31:13.789

31:25.843 --> 31:27.678
(sirens stop)

31:39.481 --> 31:41.900
(radio chatter in Japanese)

32:19.021 --> 32:21.065
We lost him.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.701
-You okay?
-Yeah.

32:32.743 --> 32:36.622
I told you to fall back.
What the hell happened?

32:36.664 --> 32:38.499
Did y'all get the targets,
or what?

32:38.540 --> 32:40.334
I took out the ministers.

32:40.376 --> 32:43.045
-And Masuda?
-I got him.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.047
-You got him?
-He was hit.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.591
I finished him off.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.719
You were our cover to get out.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.683
-You fucking left us.
-The Kempeitai done made you.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.185
I ain't gonna risk my men
on account of you getting burnt.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.396
We held up our end,
you ran away.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.606
Yeah? How the fuck they even
know who you are, O'Sullivan?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.191
-Three of my men are dead!
-Don't you put that one me.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.442
-This kid died
trying to get out!
-That's on you!

33:05.484 --> 33:07.569
-You fucked up. What?
-And where are my guns?

33:07.611 --> 33:09.613
-Where are my fucking guns?
-Why would we give you guns
when we had to finish

33:09.655 --> 33:11.240
-the job for you?
-Fuck off.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.117
-Hey, okay.
-ELIJAH: Bell, just don't.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.660
WYATT:
I'd listen to her if I were you.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.036
She's the only one of you
with any integrity.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.414
ELIJAH:
Integrity, huh? That's your bag?

33:18.455 --> 33:20.791
-'Cause I could show you
integrity...
-A lot of talk from a coward.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.668
-BELL: Don't start this
right now.
-ELIJAH: Man, take your ass

33:22.710 --> 33:25.629
-back to Dublin.
-(overlapping chatter)

33:25.671 --> 33:27.923
No, no, no, no. God-- no...

33:27.965 --> 33:30.759
Easy, okay, okay.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.469
-Hey!
-BELL: Shut your mouth...

33:32.511 --> 33:34.471
Get off me, man.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.681
(gun clicks)

33:35.723 --> 33:37.933
-Okay...
-WYATT: Childan?

33:37.975 --> 33:41.103
You bastard. You murderers.

33:41.145 --> 33:42.688
Uh-- wait, wait,
hold-hold on a minute.

33:42.730 --> 33:45.107
He's seen our faces.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.608
-Yeah, she's right.
-ELIJAH: No gunshots, though.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.652
Got your knife on you?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.237
-Yeah.
-CHILDAN: No, no, no.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.739
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't want to do this.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.992
LEON:
And why the hell not?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.745
Okay, wait, wait. Wait.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.330
You want
the Japanese gone, right?

34:00.372 --> 34:03.542
So I understand killing Masuda,
sure, he's terrifying,

34:03.584 --> 34:05.127
but the ministers?

34:05.169 --> 34:07.546
-Shimura and Nagasaki?
-What about them?

34:07.588 --> 34:08.756
They-they're advocates
for withdrawal.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.466
You're killing the wrong people.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.468
Man, he jive-talking.
Take him out of here.

34:12.509 --> 34:15.387
Wait. Withdrawal?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.641
(panting)

34:19.683 --> 34:23.896
The crown princess, she... she
called them here for a summit

34:23.937 --> 34:25.731
to explore pulling the troops
out of the JPS.

34:25.773 --> 34:29.026
-How do you know all this?
-Palace intrigue,

34:29.067 --> 34:30.235
court gossip,
that-that's my business.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.071
I-I serve the ruling class.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.574
I can get a message.

34:35.616 --> 34:39.495
I can get a message
to the crown princess.

34:39.536 --> 34:43.290
Just-- Let me serve you.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.343
(insects trilling)

35:08.190 --> 35:11.693
JULIANA (whispers):
Tagomi...

35:11.735 --> 35:14.488
What's not complete?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.044
ALT-SMITH (over phone):
Hello?

36:11.086 --> 36:13.547
Hi, John, it's Juliana.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.173
Is everything okay?

36:15.215 --> 36:17.384
Uh, yeah. I-I wondered
if you and I could meet

36:17.426 --> 36:19.970
to continue our conversation.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.413
(lighter clicks)

36:54.046 --> 36:56.632
Hey.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.675
How you doing?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.636
-You caught me just
before I left town.
-Yeah?

37:00.677 --> 37:03.680
My, uh, sales territory
is Virginia and the Carolinas.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.433
I like to drive at night. The
roads are clear, I can think.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.810
-Makes sense.
-Can you, uh, fill that up
with the rocket fuel?

37:08.852 --> 37:11.063
I have a long drive ahead of me.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.028
Okay, I'm sorry that I-I took
off like that the other night.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.738
No, it's-- I-I shouldn't
have pushed it.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.573
It was stupid of me.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.450
After everything you and Helen
have done for me,

37:23.492 --> 37:26.078
I think you've got
a right to ask.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.789
It's...

37:28.830 --> 37:31.375
it's just hard to talk about.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.211
I know. I know.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.261
Look, this...

37:44.972 --> 37:50.352
...man who shot me, uh,
is extremely powerful.

37:52.771 --> 37:57.234
So what I'm trying to do, I
guess, in a way, is-is prepare.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.653
And...

37:59.695 --> 38:01.655
better understand
what-what I'm up against,

38:01.697 --> 38:06.034
since I'm gonna
have to face him.

38:06.076 --> 38:10.414
Well, listen, you don't have
to face anything alone, Juliana.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.833
There's folks here who can help.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.626
You know?

38:14.668 --> 38:16.628
Well, that's why
I asked you here.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.630
Good.

38:18.672 --> 38:22.551
In hopes that maybe
you could help.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.597
Well, I'll do what I can.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.851
I've been thinking about
what you said the other night,

38:30.892 --> 38:34.021
about wanting to be
like your father,

38:34.062 --> 38:37.607
and the war getting in the way.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.152
What did you mean by that?

38:43.196 --> 38:45.198
(sighs):
Uh...

38:47.617 --> 38:50.996
Do you know
what a battlefield promotion is?

38:51.038 --> 38:54.624
Yeah, well,
that's what happened to me.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.836
My unit was stationed
in, uh, Mindanao.

38:57.878 --> 39:01.131
Philippines, and, uh,
my CO got, uh,

39:01.173 --> 39:04.718
killed in action.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.554
I didn't want the job, but, uh,

39:07.596 --> 39:12.559
but it... turned out
I was pretty good at it.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.145
Good with the-the power,
I guess,

39:15.187 --> 39:17.397
like my dad was good with it.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.858
But, uh...

39:25.280 --> 39:28.241
...we-we did things, you know?

39:28.283 --> 39:31.661
We, uh...

39:31.703 --> 39:34.998
We did things there that, uh,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.210
that I-I, I wouldn't be able
to tell my wife or my son about.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.628
You know?

39:39.669 --> 39:44.508
And I feel like, uh,
if I'd stayed,

39:44.549 --> 39:48.345
then that job would have...

39:48.386 --> 39:52.015
would have grown into me.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.857
Well, anyway, the war ended,
and I came back here.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.276
And I just knew
I did not want a job

40:03.318 --> 40:05.320
that made me feel
like that again.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.865
So here I am.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.368
How any of that can help you,

40:11.409 --> 40:12.661
I have no idea.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.706
Well...

40:18.708 --> 40:21.586
This, uh, this man was
in the war, too.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.171
Your generation.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.632
-Uh-huh.
-Only he just kept on advancing

40:25.674 --> 40:27.384
long after the war was over,

40:27.425 --> 40:29.469
and I just...

40:29.511 --> 40:31.555
(scoffs)

40:31.596 --> 40:35.475
I just don't know how you beat
someone with that much power.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.436
Well, listen, Juliana.

40:38.478 --> 40:41.356
I don't know who this man is,

40:41.398 --> 40:43.441
but...

40:43.483 --> 40:45.569
but that's all he is.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.946
He's just a man.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.032
(chuckles)

40:51.074 --> 40:53.577
That's all I got.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.414
Well, that's enough.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.460
Before I go,

41:02.502 --> 41:04.504
um...

41:05.922 --> 41:08.675
-Thomas.
-Mm-hmm.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.928
You know he's-he's thinking
of enlisting,

41:11.970 --> 41:14.973
-right?
-Yeah.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.938
I don't know how
to get through to him.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.816
You know those things
that you did in the Philippines

41:24.858 --> 41:28.236
that you could never tell
your wife and son about?

41:28.278 --> 41:31.031
Maybe it's time
you tell your son about them.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.453
Maybe you're right.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.056
(grunting)

42:08.235 --> 42:11.238
Reichsmarschall Smith
sends his regards.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.496
(both grunting)

42:36.930 --> 42:38.515
Go.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.456
(chokes)
