00:01.602 --> 00:04.605
**

00:09.243 --> 00:10.444
[frightened whimper]

00:15.283 --> 00:18.386
[crashing]

00:21.189 --> 00:22.123
[grunt]

00:23.424 --> 00:26.294
[hiss]

00:27.928 --> 00:32.700
Well, don't stop there! You
read; I pack. That's the deal!

00:32.766 --> 00:35.436
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
I just keep thinking about

00:35.503 --> 00:37.105
how much fun you're
going to have

00:37.171 --> 00:38.639
at the Daring
Do Convention.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.741
I wish Princess Celestia
didn't need my help

00:40.808 --> 00:43.311
with the friendship
summit in Griffonstone.

00:43.377 --> 00:47.381
Don't worry. I'll make sure
AK Yearling signs your book.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.117
I can't believe she's
going to be there.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.818
She never goes
to conventions.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.752
[sigh]

00:53.754 --> 00:57.458
Which I guess will be cool for
all those other fan-ponies,

00:57.525 --> 01:01.529
but since you and I know
AK Yearling personally...

01:01.595 --> 01:04.865
...and we know that she's
secretly Daring Do, herself...

01:04.932 --> 01:06.200
It's no big deal.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.668
This convention'll be fun,

01:07.735 --> 01:10.438
but it's nothing to
get too excited about.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.707
So! Excited!

01:19.613 --> 01:22.916
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:22.983 --> 01:24.885
* Aaaahhh *

01:24.952 --> 01:26.520
* My little Pony *

01:26.587 --> 01:29.490
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be *

01:29.557 --> 01:31.091
* My Little Pony *

01:31.159 --> 01:33.827
* Until you all shared
its magic with me *

01:33.894 --> 01:35.629
* Big adventure! *
* Tons of fun *

01:35.696 --> 01:37.465
* A beautiful heart! * *
Faithful and strong! *

01:37.531 --> 01:40.168
* Sharing kindness *
* it's an easy feat *

01:40.234 --> 01:42.370
** And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:42.436 --> 01:44.505
* To have my little pony *

01:44.572 --> 01:47.808
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:47.875 --> 01:49.877
**

01:55.516 --> 01:59.853
**

01:59.920 --> 02:02.556
You look like a pony who'd
be up for an all-inclusive,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.226
one-of-a-kind, adventu-cation
where you get to live

02:05.293 --> 02:07.728
"The Daring Do Experience."

02:07.795 --> 02:09.297
No thanks. Did
that already.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.566
Ah!

02:13.567 --> 02:14.835
[whoosh]

02:16.637 --> 02:17.705
This is the awe--

02:17.771 --> 02:19.407
--someest thing ever!

02:20.908 --> 02:24.378
Now this is something that only
a true fan can appreciate.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.680
They even put the tiles
in the right order!

02:26.747 --> 02:30.484
Good catch. I'm Quibble Pants.
Nice to meet you.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.986
Rainbow Dash.
Nice costume.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.222
You too.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.590
Thanks. The hard part was
figuring out the right--

02:36.657 --> 02:38.692
--number of arrow holes.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.562
B-because on page eighty-four
of Sapphire Stone,

02:41.629 --> 02:44.665
it describes her dodging a quote
"score of arrows shooting forth

02:44.732 --> 02:46.200
from holes in the
very walls," unquote,

02:46.267 --> 02:50.604
but then on page one hundred and
seven, Daring Do says she quote

02:50.671 --> 02:54.575
"barely made it past the trap's
barrage of arrows" unquote.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.644
But clearly, Daring
Do is embellishing

02:56.710 --> 02:58.279
and the correct
number of arrows is--

02:58.346 --> 02:59.247
Both: Twenty.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.516
[chuckling]

03:02.583 --> 03:05.586
**

03:32.613 --> 03:34.548
I am so glad I
ran into you.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.816
Even though I knew
the convention

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
would be totally awesome,

03:37.585 --> 03:38.919
it's more fun when
you're with someone

03:38.986 --> 03:40.788
who really knows
Daring Do.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.490
I know what you mean.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.725
It's so hard to find a
pony who really gets it.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.062
That's weird. We've only done
stuff from the first trilogy.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.432
After lunch, we should probably
start working our way back

03:51.499 --> 03:52.733
through the other books.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There
are no "other books."

03:57.137 --> 03:58.306
Of course there are.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.474
Daring Do and the Trek
of the Terrifying Tower,

04:00.541 --> 04:02.009
Daring Do and the
Many Faces of--

04:02.075 --> 04:06.480
Uh, please, please don't. Just
don't even mention the titles.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.948
I'm not saying those
books don't exist.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.619
I'm saying that I refuse
to acknowledge them.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.886
Why?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.288
Because they're horrible!

04:14.355 --> 04:16.790
I mean, there isn't a single
thing after Ring of Destiny

04:16.857 --> 04:19.360
that is even remotely in
the realm of the possible.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.430
WHAT! I know for a
fact that everything

04:22.496 --> 04:25.766
in every one of those books is
one hundred percent possible!

04:25.833 --> 04:28.836
And how could you
possibly know that?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.971
I just do.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.774
Well, that's a
compelling argument!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.509
Why would you even
come to this convention

04:35.576 --> 04:37.611
if you hate Daring
Do so much?!

04:37.678 --> 04:39.847
I don't hate Daring Do.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.716
The first series
was smart and cool

04:42.783 --> 04:45.719
and an amazing nod to old-time
serialized adventure books

04:45.786 --> 04:48.656
that somehow manages to be
self-reflexive and ironic

04:48.722 --> 04:51.091
while at the same time
celebrating the art form

04:51.158 --> 04:53.361
without a hint of cynicism.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.997
Which is why I came here to ask
AK Yearling, muzzle-to-muzzle,

04:57.064 --> 04:59.867
why she sold out and dumbed
down the rest of her books

04:59.933 --> 05:03.371
into just a series of
impossible action sequences.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.006
OK, now I know
you're crazy.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.610
AK Yearling is awesome and every
Daring Do book that comes out

05:09.677 --> 05:11.812
is better than the last.

05:11.879 --> 05:16.850
Wow. OK. Yeah. I'm-I'm sorry
but I could never be friends

05:16.917 --> 05:20.454
with somepony who's willing
to believe impossible stuff

05:20.521 --> 05:22.723
is possible as long
as Daring Do does it.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.426
That's OK, because I could
never be friends with somepony

05:25.493 --> 05:27.828
who's so focused on
things being possible

05:27.895 --> 05:29.497
that he's willing
to turn his back

05:29.563 --> 05:31.098
on the coolest hero
of all time!

05:31.164 --> 05:32.099
Fine!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.033
Fine!

05:35.636 --> 05:39.573
Look, just tell AK Yearling
that Rainbow Dash is here

05:39.640 --> 05:41.809
and I need her help to
convince a know-it-all pony

05:41.875 --> 05:44.645
that everything Daring Do's
ever done actually happened.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.149
Rainbow Dash?

05:49.216 --> 05:51.985
AK! I've got to talk to
you! It's an emergency!

05:53.554 --> 05:54.455
Not here.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.797
Now, tell me what's going on. Is
it Caballeron? Did you see him?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.198
What? No.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.702
But there is a pony downstairs
who thinks everything

06:08.769 --> 06:11.705
you've written after the first
trilogy is totally unrealistic

06:11.772 --> 06:14.141
and terrible and I need
you to help me prove to him

06:14.207 --> 06:16.043
that it's all
totally possible.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.678
I've got bigger
problems on my hoofs

06:17.745 --> 06:19.379
than dissatisfied
fan-ponies.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.282
Whoa!

06:22.349 --> 06:26.620
The Amulet of Culhuacan.
And Caballeron wants it.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.523
But the amulet's
only a key. [chuckle]

06:29.590 --> 06:32.159
The real treasure is
hidden in a lost temple,

06:32.225 --> 06:35.128
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.131
Caballeron wants to sell it to
the highest bidder, of course,

06:38.198 --> 06:40.534
which is why I need
to find it first.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.472
YES! Sounds like another
awesome Daring Do Adventure!

06:44.538 --> 06:46.774
But what are
you doing here?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.542
Since I haven't
found the temple yet,

06:48.609 --> 06:50.811
it's the safest place
for me and the Amulet.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.413
It's crawling with security
and if I get into trouble,

06:55.549 --> 06:58.486
I can just blend in with all
the Daring Do cos-players.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.753
How can I help?

06:59.820 --> 07:02.523
Just keep your eyes out
for anything suspicious.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.457
Got it.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.092
[knock at door]

07:05.158 --> 07:07.895
Does a pony who only
likes your first trilogy

07:07.961 --> 07:09.563
qualify as suspicious?

07:11.599 --> 07:12.199
Just checking.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.133
[door closes]

07:17.170 --> 07:21.809
[sigh] I find all this fanfare
around my archenemy disturbing.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.581
I mean, where is the
booth for Caballeron?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.185
I do not see the likeness.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.725
Come. Let us find Daring Do
and the Amulet of Culhuacan.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.027
I don't want to spend any
more time in this place

07:40.093 --> 07:41.094
than I have to.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.672
Well, if it isn't the pony
who knows impossible things

07:51.739 --> 07:55.275
can happen because
she just does.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.646
Ugh. Sorry, Quibble, I've got
more important things to do

07:58.712 --> 07:59.780
than argue with a pony

07:59.847 --> 08:02.482
who thinks awesome
means unrealistic.

08:03.350 --> 08:07.320
No, wait. I wanna hear more
about how you're 100% sure

08:07.387 --> 08:09.990
that in Curse of the Jungle
Queen, Daring Do could survive

08:10.057 --> 08:13.126
a sixty-story drop from
the top of a waterfall

08:13.193 --> 08:16.630
after sustaining a broken
wing in a category six rapid.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.698
Ugh.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.133
Obviously her wing
wasn't broke--

08:20.200 --> 08:22.102
Caballeron!

08:22.169 --> 08:24.605
See, now THAT'S a
great character!

08:24.672 --> 08:27.307
Solid backstory.
Good motivations.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.210
No-no-no! Caballeron
is right there!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.145
Of course he is.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.748
He's also over
there, over there,

08:34.815 --> 08:39.352
Oh-oh over there,
and over there.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.754
Where are you going?

08:43.691 --> 08:46.293
And we're out here because...

08:46.359 --> 08:47.761
Daring Do told me
that Caballeron

08:47.828 --> 08:51.298
came to this convention to
steal the Amulet of Culhuacan

08:51.364 --> 08:54.602
and I just saw him and his
henchponies come this way.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.170
OK. I'm gonna head back inside.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.339
Just a little
too much crazy out here

08:59.406 --> 09:01.174
for the both of us.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.175
[gasp]

09:07.748 --> 09:10.317
I do not know what
Daring Do is playing at,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.886
but if she told you two
fanponies of my plan

09:12.953 --> 09:17.390
to steal the Amulet,
you must work for her.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.361
Caballeron! HA! What do you
have to say NOW, Quibble?

09:21.428 --> 09:25.032
This was your plan to prove the
Daring Do books are realistic?

09:25.098 --> 09:28.736
You bought a "Daring Do
Experience, Adventu-cation"?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.037
Really?

09:30.103 --> 09:35.042
What?! NO! Look around us!
Henchponies. Caballeron!

09:35.108 --> 09:38.879
The jungle it took forever to
get to! This is the real deal!

09:38.946 --> 09:42.850
Right. We're ACTUALLY being
held captive by Caballeron.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.119
Please. This guy's accent
is all over the place.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.254
No offense.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.521
I....

09:48.588 --> 09:51.258
So, what's the setup,
here? You've kidnapped us

09:51.324 --> 09:54.728
and taken us to the middle
of nowhere because....?

09:54.795 --> 09:58.331
The Temple of Chicomoztoc is
somewhere in this jungle!

09:58.398 --> 10:02.903
When I find it, the Seven-Sided
Chest is as good as mine!

10:02.970 --> 10:06.373
I just need the Amulet of
Culhuacan to unlock it!

10:06.439 --> 10:09.009
Uh-huh. And Daring
Do has the Amulet,

10:09.076 --> 10:11.812
so you came up with this
overcomplicated plot

10:11.879 --> 10:15.015
to lure her into the jungle
and exchange it for us?

10:15.082 --> 10:18.318
I wouldn't call it
overcomplicated, but yes.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.187
OK, we're done here. Great work.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.690
Seriously. Very believable.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.159
[slap and shout]

10:27.394 --> 10:30.764
Listen pal, you can keep
her money, but I'm not --

10:30.831 --> 10:32.800
Going anywhere.

10:32.866 --> 10:37.004
You may not approve of my plan,
but I'm the mastermind here.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.939
Debatable.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.209
AND I SAY you will remain
here until Daring Do

10:42.275 --> 10:45.979
comes to rescue you. And if she
wants you back in one piece,

10:46.046 --> 10:48.716
she will give me the
Amulet! Tie them up.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.253
The Griffon's Lock!

10:53.320 --> 10:54.587
You know of it!

10:54.654 --> 10:57.124
Further proof that you
are an agent of Daring Do.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.692
Or an avid reader.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.397
And now I will continue
my search for the Temple.

11:04.464 --> 11:10.738
Don't go anywhere. [evil laugh]

11:10.804 --> 11:13.173
Listen, if I pretend to
believe this nonsense is real,

11:13.240 --> 11:17.845
will you call off the henchpony
repertory theater over there?

11:17.911 --> 11:21.048
They're not going to listen
to me. They abducted us BOTH!

11:21.114 --> 11:23.784
Oh, wow. So you're going
to stick with that script?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.854
Oh, OK fine. We're in
a Daring Do adventure.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.225
What was that?

11:32.292 --> 11:36.529
DARING DO! THANK
GOODNESS! WE'RE OVER HERE!

11:36.596 --> 11:40.033
Fan out! We can't let
Daring Do rescue these two.

11:42.202 --> 11:46.039
All four? I mean, shouldn't at
least one of them stay behind

11:46.106 --> 11:48.541
to guard us? Oh-oh
wait, no because then

11:48.608 --> 11:51.812
it wouldn't be a terrible
Daring Do adventure!

11:51.879 --> 11:53.313
It doesn't matter.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.715
We'll never solve the Griffon's
Lock before they get back.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.921
OK, that was pretty good.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.423
Quick! We've got to get out
of here and warn Daring Do!

12:03.490 --> 12:05.893
No way. Just point
me to the hotel

12:05.959 --> 12:07.995
and you can play fanpony

12:08.061 --> 12:10.263
and hunt treasure
out here all day long.

12:10.330 --> 12:15.402
Fine. Let's say this IS a
Daring Do Adventu-cation.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.538
The only way to get back to the
convention is to go through it.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.875
So just follow me and
I'll lead you out. Deal?

12:21.942 --> 12:25.212
Ugh. Fine.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.582
Maybe if I just leave you in
the jungle, it'll convince you.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.920
Which would make Daring Do left-
hoofed, which we KNOW is false!

12:32.986 --> 12:35.555
And THAT is everything
that's wrong with Daring Do

12:35.622 --> 12:36.824
and the Trek to the
Terrifying Tower.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.426
Now the problems with
the next book are even --

12:42.195 --> 12:46.033
Oh, right. What Daring Do
adventure would be complete

12:46.099 --> 12:48.802
without the precarious
rope bridge?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.242
I'm all for making things
feel as real as possible

12:55.308 --> 12:59.212
but are these adventu-cation
ponies sure this thing is safe?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.849
Is it too "realistic" for you?

13:01.915 --> 13:04.451
Wouldn't want THAT on a
Daring Do adventure, would we?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.854
If this were really a
Daring Do adventure,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.522
I'm sure I'd step on the wrong
plank at exactly the wrong mo-

13:09.589 --> 13:10.623
[shout]

13:10.690 --> 13:14.061
**

13:14.127 --> 13:16.997
Heh. Good thing this is all
just a pretend adventure.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.598
At least we know all
of this struggling

13:18.665 --> 13:20.600
won't make the
bridge fall apart.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.534
[snap]

13:23.070 --> 13:24.437
You need to get
your money back.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.605
[snap]

13:25.672 --> 13:27.841
[screaming]

13:29.709 --> 13:32.045
[screaming]

13:39.419 --> 13:40.988
[screaming]

13:42.422 --> 13:43.290
[thud]

13:44.357 --> 13:47.460
Ha! How's THAT for
not possible!

13:47.527 --> 13:50.597
THAT. WAS. AWESOME!
I-I-I thought we...

13:50.663 --> 13:53.200
And then you...
and the flying...

13:53.266 --> 13:55.268
Wow, and I was like
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

13:55.335 --> 13:56.669
And then you swerved!

13:56.736 --> 14:01.574
And I was-was-was on the water!
And the-the rocks?! WOW.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.510
Yeah. If you read
that in a book

14:03.576 --> 14:06.313
you might even think
it was unrealistic.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.647
OK. I'll give
you that one.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.050
I mean we could
have been done for.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.184
We could have been
done for!

14:11.251 --> 14:13.620
What kind of
Adventu-cation IS this?

14:13.686 --> 14:17.324
I mean that's just bad business!
What are these ponies thinking?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.758
[foreign accent] Right now?

14:18.825 --> 14:22.162
We are thinking that we should
thank you for escaping.

14:25.532 --> 14:31.104
For you have led us directly to
the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc!

14:31.171 --> 14:33.173
[evil laugh]

14:38.678 --> 14:40.480
Make sure they are
secure this time!

14:40.547 --> 14:42.515
We can't have them
escaping again.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.618
You'll never get
away with this.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.588
Won't I? You've led
me to the temple.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.492
And Daring Do is too noble to
let harm befall her companions

14:52.559 --> 14:56.729
so the amulet is
as good as mine.

14:56.796 --> 15:01.101
What? No witty remarks this time
about how silly my plan is?

15:01.168 --> 15:03.971
This isn't the official
Daring Do Experience

15:04.037 --> 15:06.073
Adventu-cation, is it?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.574
FINALLY!

15:07.640 --> 15:10.477
It's some cheap knock-off run by
a bunch of incompetent ponies

15:10.543 --> 15:12.712
that have no idea how to
execute this adventure

15:12.779 --> 15:14.447
with any level of safety!

15:15.415 --> 15:16.816
Ugh.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.486
What was that with the bridge!
We were in serious danger!

15:19.552 --> 15:21.721
I'm reporting you all to...

15:21.788 --> 15:23.723
Well, I don't know who
I'm reporting you to,

15:23.790 --> 15:25.692
but it's gonna be
somepony important!

15:25.758 --> 15:29.362
Oh, and this cut-rate
excuse for an "experience"

15:29.429 --> 15:31.531
hasn't proved anything
except that I'm right.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.467
It has all the hallmarks of
a lame Daring Do adventure.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.904
Uh... Quibble?

15:37.971 --> 15:41.308
No. I'M talking! Generic
jungle locations? Check.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.411
Overly complicated
villain plot? Check.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.679
Random coincidences
that conveniently

15:46.746 --> 15:49.049
get us to the next
big set piece? CHECK!

15:50.817 --> 15:53.253
Watch where you are
stepping, you fool!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.355
Listen, buddy, I
don't take orders

15:55.422 --> 15:58.091
from some second-rate
performer who learned acting

15:58.158 --> 16:00.793
from the supervillain
school of bad accents.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.630
The only thing this mess
is missing is some giant

16:03.696 --> 16:06.466
Ahuizotl wanna be monster
and I have a feeling

16:06.533 --> 16:08.235
that would be a bit too much

16:08.301 --> 16:10.370
for you bargain basement
adventurers to pull off.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.808
[roar]

16:15.875 --> 16:17.810
Um. You're real.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.179
This is real?

16:19.246 --> 16:20.147
[snap]

16:20.213 --> 16:21.381
THIS IS REAL!

16:33.826 --> 16:36.263
I told you to warn me
of anything suspicious,

16:36.329 --> 16:39.066
not run off on an
adventure without me.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.169
Whoa whoa whoa. You're real.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.137
You're-you're...
friends with her?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.475
Uh, we'll have to do
introductions later.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.742
Right now we have to--

16:49.809 --> 16:52.645
Get out of here. Yes! Thank you!

16:52.712 --> 16:54.314
Actually, no.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.448
WHAT?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.118
We can't leave
without the treasure.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.187
And we should probably get
to it before our friend

17:00.253 --> 17:01.588
gets any higher.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.056
[splash]

17:06.593 --> 17:08.061
Whoa!

17:08.128 --> 17:12.799
Seven doors, Seven locks. One
of them leads to the treasure.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.468
I'd rather not think about
what the others lead to.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.770
Yeah, yeah. The classic
pony and the tiger bit.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.072
All you have to do is--

17:19.139 --> 17:22.209
Um... Maybe you should let
Daring Do figure it out?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.643
Oh, excuse me.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.816
[fake cough] Not that one.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.125
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.826
Is he always like this?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.862
Yeah. But...he's
usually right.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.297
[sigh]

17:44.364 --> 17:45.732
Which lock do YOU think it is?

17:45.798 --> 17:50.203
FINALLY! Look. Each door has
another door that matches.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.606
THESE two both have earth
ponies fighting serpents.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.776
THESE two have Pegasi
fighting Griffons.

17:56.843 --> 18:02.515
THESE two have unicorns
fighting bears. But THIS one...

18:02.582 --> 18:04.884
Has an alicorn on it!

18:04.951 --> 18:08.921
It's the only one without a
match. How did I miss that?

18:08.988 --> 18:11.524
I've been asking myself
that ever since book four.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.500
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.437
Uh, guys?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.476
The way out is
totally covered!

18:29.542 --> 18:31.244
How are we gonna
get out of here?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.180
There!

18:34.847 --> 18:36.383
Seriously, do you
ever NOT escape

18:36.449 --> 18:37.850
out of the top of a temple?

18:39.319 --> 18:41.688
We'll have to carry mister
adventure critic out with us.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.890
We won't be fast enough!
We'll never make it!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.325
Guys!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.861
I think Rainbow Dash
and I have this covered.

18:48.928 --> 18:55.568
**

18:55.635 --> 18:58.605
Go around! You
can't go over him!

18:58.671 --> 19:01.341
Go over him? Are you crazy?

19:01.408 --> 19:04.944
If Quibble says go
over him, go over him!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.579
[scream]

19:11.017 --> 19:12.885
You two are insane!

19:12.952 --> 19:15.222
You SAID go over him!

19:15.288 --> 19:17.424
I SAID go around him!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.492
And I said be quiet!

19:19.559 --> 19:22.395
This way! I heard them!

19:22.462 --> 19:25.265
OK, I've got it. Let's
create a fake treasure

19:25.332 --> 19:28.301
out of mud and rocks, give THAT
to Caballeron and then when--

19:28.368 --> 19:31.471
Not EVERY Daring Do plan
has to be super complicated.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.975
I swear I heard them!

19:36.042 --> 19:38.010
[crash]

19:38.077 --> 19:39.546
[roar]

19:39.612 --> 19:41.248
[scream]

19:41.314 --> 19:43.550
I'll get you Daring Doooooooo!

19:47.454 --> 19:51.258
Uh. Not particularly original
or inspired, but it worked.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.559
Who are you again?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.060
He's a fan.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.264
Uh-huh. There's some stairs on
the other side of the temple

19:57.330 --> 19:58.931
that lead out of
the ravine.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.368
I suggest you two take
them and head west.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.769
What about you?

20:02.835 --> 20:06.306
I've got to get this to a
museum. Thanks for your help.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.908
I couldn't have done it
without you. Both of you.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.882
So?

20:15.948 --> 20:19.652
So. Maybe the later books
ARE slightly more realistic

20:19.719 --> 20:22.355
than I gave them credit for.
I still don't like them.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.590
What? How can you--

20:23.656 --> 20:26.459
Wait! Hold on! Before
we get in another fight,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.828
I think I finally
figured it out!

20:28.895 --> 20:32.565
I love the Daring Do that solves
puzzles and uses her brain

20:32.632 --> 20:34.401
to get out of tough situations.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.736
And she did WAY more of that
in the original trilogy.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.872
YOU love the Daring Do
that is brave and awesome

20:39.939 --> 20:42.642
and comes out on top no
matter what the odds.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.477
OK.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.379
And that's OK!

20:46.446 --> 20:48.981
We might never agree on
what makes Daring Do cool.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.485
But YOU are definitely cool.

20:52.552 --> 20:56.489
I mean the way you saved
me on the bridge? Wow.

20:56.556 --> 21:02.495
And escaping from the temple!
You, Rainbow Dash, are AWESOME.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.998
Well. I'm not the one
who can locate a treasure

21:06.065 --> 21:08.901
in half the time Daring Do can.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.803
You may have terrible
taste in books,

21:10.870 --> 21:13.840
but you're pretty
awesome yourself.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.410
In a brainy egghead puzzle-
solving kind of way.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.112
I guess we don't have to agree
on everything to get along.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.414
Friends?

21:21.481 --> 21:22.882
DEFINITELY friends.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.520
Do you think AK
Yearling would consider

21:27.587 --> 21:29.088
letting ME write the next book?

21:29.155 --> 21:30.490
I mean, think I could

21:30.557 --> 21:31.758
make things way clearer.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.760
I mean for instance, in
the second adventure

21:33.826 --> 21:34.994
there's a side
character;

21:35.061 --> 21:36.228
I don't want to kind
of name it right now,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.565
because it's sort of
this thing that I've

21:38.631 --> 21:39.599
already written a lot
of fan fiction on.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.800
I don't want you know...

21:40.867 --> 21:42.101
Not that I'm saying that
you would steal it;

21:42.168 --> 21:44.804
but I am saying that this
would totally go along,

21:44.871 --> 21:46.873
my whole thing about
puzzle solving.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.975
Except what if each
puzzle that was solved

21:49.041 --> 21:50.943
unlocked a new karate move?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.679
Think of it that way, right?

21:52.745 --> 21:54.514
I'm kind of a Yearlite myself,

21:54.581 --> 21:55.948
so I'm sure she'd be open to--

21:56.015 --> 21:57.850
Rainbow Dash: Uh, Quibble?

21:57.917 --> 21:58.785
Sorry!
