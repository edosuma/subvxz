WEBVTT

00:07.810 --> 00:09.414
I'M STILL WAITING, SHAWN.

00:09.450 --> 00:13.250
OKAY, I'M GONNA TAKE
YOUR POINTY, SAD-FACED GUY

00:13.290 --> 00:15.155
FOR MY HORSEY GUY.

00:15.190 --> 00:17.055
STOP, STOP.
WHAT IS THIS PIECE CALLED?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.489
I CALL HIM DWIGHT.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.837
WHAT IS THIS ONE CALLED?

00:20.870 --> 00:22.599
B.A. BARACUS.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.141
LOOK, SHAWN, IF YOU'RE GONNA
PLAY THIS GAME,

00:24.180 --> 00:25.477
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
WHAT THE PIECES ARE CALLED.

00:25.510 --> 00:27.341
WHAT IF I DON'T WANNA
PLAY THIS GAME?

00:27.380 --> 00:28.347
CHESS IS IMPORTANT.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.358
IT'S ABOUT STRATEGY.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.618
IT'S ABOUT ANTICIPATING
YOUR OPPONENT'S NEXT MOVES.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.525
THIS GAME
IS AN ALLEGORY FOR LIFE.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.720
AN ALLE-WHAT?

00:34.770 --> 00:36.431
LOOK, WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE FORCE,

00:36.470 --> 00:38.768
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE IN
HUGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.368
ALIBIS, MOTIVES,
WITNESS STATEMENTS.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.399
AND TRUST ME.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.508
IF YOU WANNA WIN,

00:42.550 --> 00:45.280
THIS IS NOT STUFF THAT YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE UP AS YOU GO.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.412
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:46.460 --> 00:48.724
AND I WANT YOU TO FOCUS
AND GET SERIOUS.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.301
UH...

00:54.340 --> 00:56.433
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

00:56.480 --> 00:57.504
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.575
WHAT DID I JUST--

00:58.610 --> 01:00.111
NEVER MIND.
I REMEMBER.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.556
CH ECKMATE.

01:03.590 --> 01:04.454
BYE, DAD.

01:11.570 --> 01:12.537
(DAPHNE)
TELL ME.

01:12.570 --> 01:13.901
IS HE CHEATING ON ME?

01:13.940 --> 01:15.441
JURY'S STILL OUT.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.710
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HE'S
TOUCHED RECENTLY?

01:17.750 --> 01:19.752
OH.

01:19.790 --> 01:21.826
I HAVE THE RECEIPT
FROM LUNCH.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.377
I'M SENSING THAT HE
ALWAYS TAKES YOU OUT FOR LUNCH.

01:30.410 --> 01:32.241
THAT HE NEVER PAYS
WITH A CREDIT CARD.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.247
ALWAYS CASH.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.247
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.643
I'M ALSO SENSING
THAT YOU

01:35.690 --> 01:37.419
CAN ONLY CALL HIM AT THE OFFICE
OR ON HIS CELL PHONE.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.757
NEVER, EVER AT HOME?

01:38.790 --> 01:39.927
THAT'S DEAD ON.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.791
YOU MUST GET GOOSEBUMPS
BEING AROUND HIM.

01:41.830 --> 01:42.922
OH, I GET SOMETHING.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.665
DAPHNE, I HAVE GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

01:44.710 --> 01:46.735
THE GOOD NEWS
IS HE'S NOT SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.805
THE BAD NEWS...

01:48.850 --> 01:49.976
HE'S MARRIED.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.581
WHAT?

01:52.620 --> 01:53.609
ARE YOU SURE?

01:53.660 --> 01:56.424
JUST TELL HIM A FRIEND TOLD YOU
HE WAS MARRIED

01:56.460 --> 01:59.338
AND HIS FACE
WILL TELL YOU THE REST.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.234
BUT...

02:00.240 --> 02:01.935
WHEN THE MOURNING PERIOD
IS OVER,

02:01.970 --> 02:04.746
THIS
IS MY FRIEND GUS'S CARD.

02:04.780 --> 02:06.441
HE'S A GOOD LISTENER,
AND HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE

02:06.480 --> 02:07.742
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF
FOR A GIRL.

02:07.780 --> 02:08.917
SHAWN, I DO NOT--

02:08.950 --> 02:09.985
NO, NO.
YOU KEEP THAT.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.954
PLEASE.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.589
(Gus)
SHAWN, WE'VE REACHED
A CERTAIN LEVEL

02:15.630 --> 02:16.597
OF SUCCESS.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.868
IF YOU WANNA
KEEP DOING THESE

02:17.900 --> 02:19.538
IS "MY BOYFRIEND
CHEATING ON ME" CASES,

02:19.580 --> 02:20.933
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
THEM WITHOUT ME.

02:20.980 --> 02:22.902
GUS, YOU CONTINUE
TO UNDERESTIMATE ME.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.781
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT RIGHT NOW, AS WE SPEAK,

02:24.820 --> 02:25.912
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO THE OFFICE

02:25.950 --> 02:28.828
TO MEET WITH TWO GENTLEMEN
NAMED SHOCKLEY AND GODDARD

02:28.860 --> 02:30.088
WHO HAVE A VERY BIG CASE
FOR US.

02:30.130 --> 02:31.097
SO WHAT ARE WE TALKIN'?

02:31.130 --> 02:33.098
ROBBERY?
MISSING PERSONS?

02:33.130 --> 02:36.577
THEY WANT US TO LOOK
INTO THE SERIOUS MATTER OF...

02:36.610 --> 02:38.373
WELL, THAT ACTUALLY
WASN'T IN THE E-MAIL.

02:38.410 --> 02:39.638
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS REAL?

02:39.680 --> 02:40.840
THEY USED ALL CAPS, GUS.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.847
THE MEETING'S AT 2:00.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.414
WE BE'I'I'ER HURRY.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.882
IT'S 2:18.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.898
WELL, SOMEBODY HAD TO HAVE
THE BELGIAN CHOCOLATE FONDUE.

02:46.930 --> 02:49.660
DIDN'T THEY?
THAT WAS YOU, SHAWN.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.429
WELL PLAYED, SIR.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.599
JUST LET ME
DO THE TALKING.

02:55.650 --> 02:56.446
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SCARE THEM OFF

02:56.480 --> 02:58.072
WITH YOUR NON SEQUITUR
RIDICULOUSNESS.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.824
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
MR. SHOCKLEY AND MR. GODDARD.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.009
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

03:14.050 --> 03:15.142
*

03:15.190 --> 03:16.885
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:16.920 --> 03:18.785
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

03:18.830 --> 03:19.990
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:20.030 --> 03:21.793
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

03:21.830 --> 03:23.127
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION?

03:23.170 --> 03:25.434
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

03:25.470 --> 03:26.971
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

03:27.010 --> 03:29.513
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

03:29.550 --> 03:31.541
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

03:35.560 --> 03:37.152
OKAY, BEFORE ONE OF US
GOES ALL CRAZY

03:37.200 --> 03:38.895
AND DEMANDS THE OTHER ONE
APOLOGIZE

03:38.930 --> 03:40.636
FOR TAKING A CASE
FROM A COUPLE GRADE SCHOOLERS,

03:40.670 --> 03:42.137
LET'S JUST HEAR THEM OUT.

03:44.740 --> 03:46.241
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU,
GENTLEMEN?

03:46.280 --> 03:48.840
ONE OF OUR TEACHERS
IS A MURDERER.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.050
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.785
PLEASE, CONTINUE.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.979
(Goddard)
HE'S KILLED BEFORE.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.998
AND IN TWO DAYS,
HE'S GONNA KILL AGAIN.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.066
AND THE COPS DON'T LISTEN TO US
'CAUSE WE'RE KIDS.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.159
OKAY, WELL,
SINCE WE'RE HERE,

03:59.210 --> 04:00.472
AND WE DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER MEETING FOR...

04:00.480 --> 04:02.345
A WEEK,

04:02.380 --> 04:04.541
WHICH ONE OF YOUR TEACHERS IS
GOING TO DO THIS TERRIBLE THING?

04:04.580 --> 04:05.717
WE DON'T KNOW.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.887
WHO'S BEEN MURDERED?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.683
WE DON'T KNOW.
WHO'S THE NEXT VICTIM?

04:08.730 --> 04:09.685
WE DON'T KNOW.

04:09.730 --> 04:11.095
PERFECT.
I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.097
SHAWN.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.064
I GOT NOTHING.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.738
CAN WE JUST START
FROM THE TOP?

04:15.770 --> 04:17.829
YES.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.848
WELL, SHOCK AND I
GO TO MEITNER, AND...

04:19.880 --> 04:22.610
THE MEITNER SCHOOL
FOR GIFI'ED STUDENTS?

04:22.650 --> 04:24.151
THESE KIDS
ARE GENIUSES.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.179
TECH NICALLY,

04:25.220 --> 04:27.029
NEAR GENIUS.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.197
THE SCHOOL HAS
SOME PRETTY COOL STUFF.

04:28.230 --> 04:29.595
SO WE BROKE IN
LATE AT NIGHT.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.858
SAY NO MORE.
FIGHT CLUB.

04:31.910 --> 04:34.174
(Goddard)
NO, TO HACK
INTO A SPACE PROBE

04:34.210 --> 04:35.575
AND SEE IF WE COULD GET IT
TO BLINK A WORD

04:35.610 --> 04:36.713
IN OLD MORSE CODE.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.615
WHICH WORD?

04:38.650 --> 04:40.311
BOOBS.
BOOBS.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.089
YOU WENT FROM ALL THAT TROUBLE
JUST TO GET SOME NASA TECHS

04:42.130 --> 04:43.119
TO SCRATCH THEIR HEADS?

04:43.160 --> 04:44.764
YEAH.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.267
COME ON, GUS.
THAT'S KINDA FUNNY.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.767
(Shockley)
WHILE RECONFIGURING
THE RECEIVER,

04:47.800 --> 04:49.802
WE ACCIDENTALLY TAPPED
INTO A CELL PHONE CALL

04:49.840 --> 04:50.807
BEING MADE
FROM THE MEITNER CAMPUS.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.000
IT WAS STATICKY.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.972
BUT WE HEARD
A DEEP, GRAVELLY VOICE

04:54.020 --> 04:55.009
TALKING TO THEIR COUSIN.

04:55.050 --> 04:56.085
SOMEONE NAMED MURIEL.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.348
AND YOU WANT US
TO FIGURE OUT WHY

04:57.390 --> 05:00.052
SOMEONE WOULD NAME
THEIR KID MURIEL?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.727
THE VOICE SAID
SOMETHING LIKE,

05:01.770 --> 05:03.692
"I'M NOT GONNA BE PUSHED
INTO A CORNER AGAIN."

05:03.740 --> 05:04.866
(Shawn)
ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T

05:04.900 --> 05:05.901
DIRTY DANCING?

05:05.940 --> 05:07.828
AND THEN WE ALSO HEARD
VERBATIM

05:07.880 --> 05:10.075
"IF I HAVE TO,
I'LL KILL HIM.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.839
"IT WON'T BE MY FIRST TIME.

05:12.890 --> 05:13.914
BY WEDNESDAY,
HE'S A GONER."

05:13.960 --> 05:15.848
A GONER?

05:15.890 --> 05:16.857
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
JAMES CAGNEY.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.219
SHAWN,
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE?

05:21.400 --> 05:22.264
(together)
WE'RE TAKING THIS CASE.

05:22.310 --> 05:24.232
(together)
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS CASE?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.202
IT'S A CHANCE TO GO UNDERCOVER
IN HIGH SCHOOL

05:26.250 --> 05:27.217
A LA 21 JUMPSTREET.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.286
OBVIOUSLY,
I'M JOHNNY DEPP.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.185
SADLY, YOU CAN ONLY PASS
FOR HOLLY ROBINSON.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.858
WHY CAN'T I BE
RICHARD GRIECO?

05:32.890 --> 05:34.255
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE
RICHARD GRIECO?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.291
ISN'T THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU SAY,

05:36.340 --> 05:38.262
(mimicking Gus)
"THERE AIN'T NO CASE HERE,
SHAWN."

05:38.300 --> 05:41.076
(mimicking Gus)
JUST A COUPLE KIDS
CRYING WOLF.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.873
I DON'T SOUND
LIKE RICHARD ROUNDTREE, SHAWN.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.969
WHY ARE YOU SO EAGER?

05:45.020 --> 05:45.987
SAME AS YOU.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.419
I WAS A KING
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.348
JUST BECAUSE YOU CARRIED A
SCEPTER DOESN'T MAKE YOU A KING.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.459
THAT'S BECAUSE
I WAS IN MACBETH.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.422
DUDE, YOU PLAYED
BANQUO'S KID.

05:52.470 --> 05:55.359
YOU GUYS,
CAN YOU HELP US?

05:55.410 --> 05:57.799
IS A LIZARD'S SKIN
DRY AND CRACKED?

05:57.840 --> 05:59.376
[whispering to each other]

06:03.390 --> 06:05.255
WE BELIEVE
THAT IT IS.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.274
GUESS WHAT TODAY IS.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.868
IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE
TOUCHY-FEELY HOLIDAYS

06:17.920 --> 06:20.059
INVENTED BY CARD COMPANIES
TO GOAD ME INTO BUYING A PRESENT

06:20.090 --> 06:21.079
FOR SOMEBODY I COULDN'T CARE
LESS ABOUT, IS IT?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.519
NO, TODAY'S
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.448
COME AGAIN?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.092
IT'S BEEN ONE YEAR TO THE DAY

06:26.130 --> 06:27.995
THAT I CAME TO SANTA BARBARA
AND WE GOT PARTNERED UP.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.132
HMM.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.205
I DIDN'T GET YOU A PRESENT.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.572
I DON'T WANT A PRESENT.
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN SAY.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.544
BUT BELIEVE ME, DEEP DOWN,
YOU WANT A PRESENT.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.116
MY SOON-TO-BE EX-WIFE
ALWAYS HATED

06:36.150 --> 06:37.356
WHAT I GAVE HER.

06:37.390 --> 06:38.425
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER?

06:38.460 --> 06:39.449
CASH, MOSTLY.

06:39.490 --> 06:40.491
UGH.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.929
ANYWAY,

06:41.970 --> 06:43.562
THIS ANNIVERSARY MEANS
THAT MY ONE-YEAR PROBATION

06:43.600 --> 06:44.828
PERIOD IS OVER.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.428
SO WHAT I WANT,

06:46.480 --> 06:48.539
THAT IS,
WHAT WOULD BE GOOD,

06:48.580 --> 06:50.104
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS--

06:50.150 --> 06:52.414
I THINK I'M ENTITLED
TO BE PRIMARY ON A CASE.

06:54.890 --> 06:56.221
HOW LATE ARE THE SHOPS OPEN
TONIGHT?

06:56.260 --> 06:59.229
CHIEF VICK SAYS MOLDING
YOUNG OFFICERS IS YOUR DUTY.

06:59.270 --> 07:00.828
AND SHE'S ALREADY
APPROVED THIS.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.262
NOW GIVE ME A CASE.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.180
LET'S SEE.
HOMICIDE.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.154
THAT'S A BIT MESSY
FOR YOUR FIRST TIME.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.054
HI-TECH BURGLARY.

07:13.090 --> 07:16.059
YOU NEED A LOT OF FORENSICS
FOR THAT ONE.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.032
BAKE SALE SLAP FIGHT.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.176
SEEMS EASY, BUT BELIEVE ME,
I WORKED ONE ONCE.

07:20.210 --> 07:21.234
HAD TO CALL IN S.W.A.T.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.440
OH, COME ON.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.243
ALL RIGHT.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.909
COUPLE KIDS CAME IN COMPLAINING
ABOUT ONE OF THE TEACHERS.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.259
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NOTHING OF
LOWER PRIORITY FOR ME TO HANDLE?

07:31.300 --> 07:33.222
LESSON NUMBER ONE, O'HARA.

07:33.270 --> 07:34.931
THERE ARE NO SMALL CASES;

07:34.970 --> 07:36.506
ONLY SMALL DETECT IVES.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.946
LET'S ROLL.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.151
(Shawn)
AH, HIGH SCHOOL.

07:46.190 --> 07:47.350
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO PROVE

07:47.400 --> 07:48.594
THAT ONE OF OUR TEACHERS
WAS A MONSTER.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.360
YOU REMEMBER OUR FRESHMAN MUSIC
TEACHER, MRS. JORGENSTORM?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.106
SHE WAS A NIGHTBREED.
SHE WAS NOT.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.175
SHE USED TO DATE CRAIG SHEFFER.
SHE DID NOT.

07:54.210 --> 07:56.246
SHE WORE A TON OF MAKE-UP
AND LIVED IN A CEMETERY.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.419
NEXT TO A CEMETERY.
SO SHE CLAIMED.

07:58.450 --> 08:00.680
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU WERE ALWAYS TOO AFRAID

08:00.720 --> 08:02.358
TO FOLLOW HER HOME.

08:02.390 --> 08:03.322
SO ANY LEADS YET?

08:03.360 --> 08:04.759
HOLD IT THERE, DOOGIE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.392
WHERE DO I GET
A JUICE BOX?

08:06.430 --> 08:08.398
AND DOES IT COME
IN GRAPE-A-LICIOUS?

08:08.440 --> 08:09.429
SHOULDN'T YOU BE DOING
PSYCHIC STUFF?

08:09.470 --> 08:11.438
SOMEONE COULD BE KILLED
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.368
POSSIBLY ONE OF US.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.015
IF YOU'RE SO SMART,
WHY DON'T YOU SOLVE THE THING?

08:16.050 --> 08:17.085
MIDTERMS? DUH.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.678
I NEED TO MAINTAIN
MY G.P.A.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.096
TO KEEP MY SCHOLARSHIP STIPEND.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.290
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.264
CLEARLY, WE HAVE TO GET INSIDE.
WHAT'S OUR COVER GONNA BE?

08:24.300 --> 08:25.267
WAIT, I'VE GOT IT.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.504
YOU'RE THE PREPPY JERK
WHO'S DATING THE GIRL

08:26.540 --> 08:27.768
I'M IN LOVE WITH.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.209
I'M THE LONELY CAFETERIA GUY

08:29.250 --> 08:30.205
WHO MOWS LAWNS
AND HAS A HEART OF GOLD.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.309
LET IT GO, SHAWN.
YOU CAN'T PASS FOR A TEENAGER.

08:32.350 --> 08:33.385
(Goddard)
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.354
YOU GOT RHYTIDS
AROUND THE EYES.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.119
WHAT DID HE JUST
SAY TO ME?

08:37.160 --> 08:38.195
CROW'S FEET.
DO YOU SQUINT

08:38.230 --> 08:41.131
OR MAKE FUNNY FACES A LOT?

08:41.170 --> 08:43.263
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS ARE ALL NUTS.

08:43.310 --> 08:44.607
IF I GREW MY HAIR OUT,
RAISED MY VOICE AN OCT AVE,

08:44.640 --> 08:45.641
I COULD--
STOP, SHAWN.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.772
I'VE ALREADY WORKED IT OUT.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.549
WE'RE DOCUMENTARIANS
WORKING ON A NEW FILM

08:48.590 --> 08:51.252
CALLED TEENIUSES: IN THE MIX.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.427
TEENIUSES?
YES.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.428
REALLY, DUDE?

08:54.460 --> 08:57.361
YOU'VE GOT TEENIUSES RIGHT
ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE?
IN THE MIX.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.107
WE ALREADY GOT
YOUR COVER STORY.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.072
(Headmaster)
PERSONALLY, I'M NOT SURE

09:01.080 --> 09:05.449
THAT I SEE THE MERITS OF A CLASS
IN PARANORMAL STUDIES,

09:05.490 --> 09:07.617
BUT WE DO LET THE STUDENTS
CHOOSE ONE GUEST INSTRUCTOR

09:07.660 --> 09:09.127
A SEMESTER.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.527
C. EVERETI' KOOP WAS CRUSHED
THAT HE DIDN'T GET IT.

09:15.510 --> 09:16.807
WHAT IS THIS?
LIKE A STUDY HALL?

09:16.840 --> 09:18.478
OH, NO.
RECESS.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.449
[sniffing]
DOES IT SMELL
LIKE TEEN SPIRIT IN HERE?

09:24.490 --> 09:27.357
SHH!

09:27.400 --> 09:28.389
SHH.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.609
[chair rattling]

09:35.650 --> 09:37.572
SO TELL ME, HEADMASTER,

09:37.620 --> 09:40.441
CAN A FORMER APPLICANT REQUEST

09:40.490 --> 09:42.378
OH, NO.
WHY?

09:42.430 --> 09:45.297
OH, FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S
GENERAL WELFARE.

09:45.330 --> 09:48.299

09:48.340 --> 09:50.501
DEBBIE WILL GIVE YOU THE FORMS
YOU'LL NEED TO SIGN.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.544
AN APPLICATION, GUS?

09:55.580 --> 09:57.252
JUST CURIOUS.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.518
YOU APPLIED TO THIS SCHOOL
BACK IN THE DAY.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.289
DIDN'T YOU?
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT IT.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.194
WHO CAN REMEMBER
THAT FAR BACK?

10:01.200 --> 10:05.603
W-WHOA, IS THAT WHY YOU CRIED
FOR A MONTH WHEN WE WERE TEN?

10:05.640 --> 10:06.937
BECAUSE THEY REJECT ED YOU?

10:06.980 --> 10:07.969
[whispering]
GET DOWN.

EXCUSE ME.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.526
O'HARA.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.994
LESSON NUMBER TWO.
COPS DON'T WAIT IN LINE.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.338
THEY GO STRAIGHT
TO THE FRONT.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.736
EVEN AT STARBUCKS.

10:22.770 --> 10:24.476
HI, SBPD.

10:24.510 --> 10:25.545
CAN I PLEASE GET THE CLASS
SCHEDULES FOR THESE STUDENTS?

10:25.580 --> 10:26.945
THANK YOU.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.641
LESSON NUMBER THREE.
DON'T SAY "PLEASE,"

10:28.680 --> 10:30.716
DON'T SAY "THANK YOU,"
AND DEFINITELY DON'T SAY "HI."

10:30.760 --> 10:32.625
SPIRIT SQUAD AUDITIONS
WERE OVER TEN YEARS AGO.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.799
YOU'RE AN AUTHORITY FIGURE.
ACT LIKE IT.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.627
EVER HEARD "YOU CATCH MORE FLIES

10:36.670 --> 10:37.796

CORNPONE COUNTRY BUMPKIN SAYINGS

10:39.610 --> 10:40.679

LASSIE THREE
WAS A RETIRED POLICE DOG.

OH.

10:59.510 --> 11:01.319

WHAT YOU TWO HAD IN COMMON.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.448
STRONG, DEDICATED,
LOYAL.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.559

11:13.910 --> 11:15.571

11:19.520 --> 11:21.579
HMM?

11:21.620 --> 11:23.451
OH! RIGHT.
[clears throat]

11:23.490 --> 11:26.095
STAY OUT OF OUR WAY
AND DON'T GET INVOLVED, SPENCER.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.107
THIS PLACE
IS OVERWHELMING.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.209
WHERE DO WE EVEN START?

11:31.240 --> 11:34.141
EASY. WHO WERE THE EYES AND EARS
OF DUFMAN ELEMENTARY?

11:34.180 --> 11:35.613
MR. GRAVES, THE CUSTODIAN.

11:35.650 --> 11:37.584
WE HAD A SPECIAL BOND.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.623
CUSTODIANS HAVE ACCESS
TO THE BUILDING AT NIGHT.

11:42.670 --> 11:44.865
HE COULD BE OUR BAD GUY.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.039
IF HE HAS A DEEP
AND GRAVELLY VOICE,

11:47.080 --> 11:49.901
HE'S EL SUSPECTO PRIMERO.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.155
YO.

11:55.190 --> 11:56.680
HOW YOU DOING?

11:56.730 --> 11:58.755
I'M MOPPING UP VOMIT.
HOW DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.439
BY THE WAY, THOSE MATS IN FRONT
OF THE DOORS ARE

12:01.440 --> 12:04.500
TO RUB YOUR SHOES ON.
THANKS FOR THE EXTRA WORK.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.098
UH, WHOOPS.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:06.150 --> 12:08.618
UH, I'M SHAWN SPENCER,
PSYCHIC LECTURER.

12:08.650 --> 12:11.084
AND I SENSE THAT SOMETHING
IS AMISS IN YOUR UNIVERSE.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.122
YEAH, MY LUMBAGO'S
FLARING UP.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.081
NOPE, NOT THAT.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.859
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
OUT OF THE ORDINARY...

12:15.900 --> 12:17.868
SOMETHING...
ANYTHING?

12:17.900 --> 12:19.629
CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

12:19.670 --> 12:21.672
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN HERE
ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

12:21.710 --> 12:24.975
OH.
UM...

12:25.020 --> 12:27.159
NOPE. NOTHINGUEIPRINGS TO MIND.

12:27.190 --> 12:29.624
I CAN SENSE YOU'RE LYING.

12:29.660 --> 12:33.528
THE SPIRITS TELL ME THAT YOUR
LITTLE PANTS ARE ON FIRE.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.266
FINE.
I FOUND THIS WEIRD GOLD PIN

12:36.310 --> 12:38.232
WHEN I HAD TO WORK
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.612
WHEN I MOPPED THIS AREA,
NO PIN.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.845
BUT WHEN I CIRCLED BACK TO WAX,
THERE IT WAS.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.551
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT GOT HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

12:44.590 --> 12:45.818
WHO DO I LOOK LIKE?
JAKE AND THE FATMAN?

12:45.860 --> 12:47.691
ALL I KNOW IS THAT AFTER TWO
WEEKS IN THE LOST AND FOUND,

12:47.730 --> 12:50.563
IT'S MINE.
LEGIT.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.104
WHERE IS THIS LOST AND FOUND?

12:54.140 --> 12:58.577
WHO LOSES A MICROSCOPE AND
DOESN'T COME LOOKING FOR IT?

12:58.620 --> 13:01.555
EAR INFECTION MEDICINES.
INHALERS.

13:01.560 --> 13:06.293
WHAT APPEARS TO BE 168 PAIRS
OF HIDEOUS EYEGLASSES.

13:11.910 --> 13:12.945
S.X.Y.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.949
APPARENTLY, OUR PERP IS SO SEXY,
HE FELT THE NEED

13:15.990 --> 13:19.255
TO DIE CAST IT ONTO STEEL
AND WEAR IT ON HIS LAPEL.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.325
THAT'S NOT AN S.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.850
THAT'S THE INTEGRAL SIGN
IN CALCULUS

13:21.900 --> 13:23.322
FOR THE AREA
UNDER THE CURVE XY.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.702
WHOEVER WAS SKULKING
AROUND HERE AFTER HOURS

13:25.740 --> 13:26.866
MUST BE A MATH TEACHER.

13:26.910 --> 13:27.899
HOW MANY MATH TEACHERS
WORK HERE?

13:27.940 --> 13:28.929
FOUR OR FIVE TOPS?

13:28.980 --> 13:29.947
18.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.174
HMM.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.939
I HAVE A PLAN.
IT'S A SCARY ONE.

13:33.990 --> 13:36.424
WE'LL HAVE TO RELY
ON ALL OUR ANIMAL INSTINCTS.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.896
WE ARE GOING
TO THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.975
TRY TO BLEND IN.
ACT NATURAL.

13:48.020 --> 13:48.918
[Shawn clearing throat]

13:48.950 --> 13:51.054
HOW 'BOUT THESE KIDS TODAY, HUH?

13:51.090 --> 13:53.729
OH, MY GOD, LOOK
AT THIS SELECTION OF DONUTS.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.092
THIS IS PATHETIC.

13:56.130 --> 13:57.392
WHO LEFT A TENTH?

13:57.440 --> 13:58.930
I WANNA KNOW HOW
THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.437
YOU--
SHAWN, FOCUS.

14:00.470 --> 14:01.676
MATH TEACHER.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.375
[donut dropping]

14:03.410 --> 14:05.014
THERE'S
NO MATH TEACHERS HERE.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.039
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

14:08.360 --> 14:09.987
THAT GUY'S
BEEN WEARING GOGGLES.

14:10.030 --> 14:13.864
HE'S CLEARLY
A CHEM LAB TEACHER.

14:13.900 --> 14:14.867
[violin note]

14:14.900 --> 14:16.731
VIOLIN HICKEY.
MUSIC TEACHER.

14:18.510 --> 14:20.273
HOWEVER, A GYM TEACHER
COULD BE MORE OUR SPEED.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.865
HEY, BUDDY.

14:29.900 --> 14:30.832
UH, WE'RE NEW HERE.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.065
AND WE WERE TOLD
TO SEE A MATH TEACHER

14:33.110 --> 14:33.929
SPECIALIZING IN CALCULUS.

14:33.970 --> 14:37.144
PROFESSOR HAHN HANDLES
ALL REMEDIAL MATH.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.272
THAT QUALIFIES AS REMEDIAL.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.016
WHAT'S CALCULUS? THE ONE
WITH THE BLOCKS AND THE SHAPES?

14:41.060 --> 14:42.880
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?

14:42.930 --> 14:44.022
YOU CAN CATCH HIM
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.925
HE'S IN MY CARPOOL.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.164
SWEET!
GUS, THIS SCHOOL HAS A CARPOOL.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.189
ANSWER TO OUR PRAYERS.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.105
WHY?
GUS MANAGED
TO GET HIS CAR IMPOUNDED.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.107
HE PARKED ON A STATUE.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.107
I'M CONTESTING THE TICKET.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.402
HERE'S THE THING.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.839
WE HAD TO TAKE THE BUS
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.141
I ACCIDENTALLY
GAVE MYSELF A WEDGY.

14:57.190 --> 14:59.112
GUS HAD TO SIT
NEXT TO THE GIRL WHO PEED.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.127
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ALL OF THIS?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.798
I THOUGHT IT SEEMED OBVIOUS.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.394
CAN WE GET A LIFT HOME?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.143
SO MUST BE FUN
BEING A GYM TEACHER.

15:10.180 --> 15:12.045
YOU GET TO PLAY SPORTS
ALL DAY.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.049
I TEACH GYM AT A SCHOOL
FULL OF PRODIGY NERDS.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.320
I START OFF MY DAY
BY GETTING 300 NOTES

15:17.360 --> 15:20.523
EXCUSING KIDS FROM GYM CLASS
BECAUSE OF RICKETS OR IBS.

15:20.570 --> 15:23.130
I TOSSED A BALL
AT A STUDENT ONCE.

15:23.170 --> 15:24.137
HE WET HIS PANTS.

15:24.170 --> 15:27.549
AND HIS PARENTS FILED
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST ME.

15:27.580 --> 15:30.583
PROFESSOR HAHN.
HAH N.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.053
MATH TEACHER, RIGHT?

15:32.090 --> 15:35.992

15:39.140 --> 15:41.005
I'M GETTING
A FEELING ABOUT YOU.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.473
ARE YOU

15:42.510 --> 15:44.410

15:56.670 --> 15:58.228
I'M SENSING RILEY
MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN

15:58.280 --> 16:00.441
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T USE

16:00.480 --> 16:01.913
WOW, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.410
OKAY, RIGHT HERE.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.266

16:12.310 --> 16:13.265
SOUNDS LIKE OUR GUY.

16:13.310 --> 16:14.106
NOW WE'VE

16:14.140 --> 16:15.971
WHY AND HOW

16:16.010 --> 16:18.069
[rapping on window]

16:18.120 --> 16:19.109
AND ONE MORE THING.

16:19.150 --> 16:21.357
IF YOU ARE LATE
PICKING ME UP IN THE MORNING,

16:21.390 --> 16:23.085
I WILL TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.092
MAYBE JUST THE HOW.

16:28.470 --> 16:29.505
(Gus)
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR YOUR PSYCHIC SEMINAR?

16:29.540 --> 16:31.235
(Shawn)
GUS, PLEASE.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.178
ANY LEADS?

16:32.210 --> 16:35.111
I'M ADAPTING THIS
INTO A NANCY DREW FANFIC.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.118
I BELIEVE WHOEVER'S INVOLVED
IS IN THE VICINITY.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.309
WE MADE NOTES FOR YOU.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.453
BULLET POINTS
YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY TO HIT.

16:40.490 --> 16:42.321
DON'T SHOW ANY FEAR.
DON'T SPLIT ANY INFINITIVES.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.395
DON'T DANGLE YOUR PARTICIPLES.

16:43.430 --> 16:44.397
AT LEAST NOT IN PUBLIC.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.137
LOOK, IF I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE SAYING,

16:47.180 --> 16:48.477
I'D STILL BE A VIRGIN.

16:48.510 --> 16:50.501
NOW, RUN ALONG.

16:50.550 --> 16:53.212
GO TO CLASS.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.387
REALLY?

16:54.420 --> 16:55.557
[school bell ringing]

16:55.590 --> 16:57.524
[students chattering]

17:05.540 --> 17:07.349
HAHN IS HERE.

17:07.380 --> 17:11.555
THE SEMINAR'S OPEN TO BOTH
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, GUS.

17:11.590 --> 17:13.649
I PERSONALLY EXTENDED HAHN
AN INVITATION SO I CAN GRILL HIM

17:13.690 --> 17:15.226
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.093
IF HE'S KILLED BEFORE,
I'LL GET HIM TO CONFESS.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.493
HOW'RE YOU
GONNA INTERROGATE SOMEONE

17:19.540 --> 17:21.576
AND TEACH A CLASS
AT THE SAME TIME?

17:21.610 --> 17:23.544
FIRST THE CARROT,

17:23.580 --> 17:25.116
THEN THE STICK.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.583
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, DO YOU?

17:26.620 --> 17:29.418
LEAVE ME ALONE.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.257
PHSYSICS.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.359
THE PHYSICS OF PSYCHICS.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.822
I'M PROFESSOR SHAWN SPENCER.

17:34.870 --> 17:39.375
I WILL BE YOUR PSYCHIC FERRYMAN
OVER THE RIVER STYX.

17:39.410 --> 17:40.502
THAT'S GUS.

17:40.550 --> 17:41.517
MY FERRY.

17:41.550 --> 17:42.915
HELLO.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.759
(Shawn)
EACH ONE OF US IS BORN
WITH A KERNEL

17:44.790 --> 17:48.396
OF WHAT I LIKE TO DUB
PARANORMALEVOLANCE.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.556
I, HOWEVER,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.591
WAS BORN
WITH AN EXTRA NORMAL AMOUNT.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.460
TWO COPS TO BE EXACT.

17:53.510 --> 17:54.738
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.153
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING
YOUR BRACES REMOVED.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.253
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE PSYCHIC.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.597
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
HYPER-OBSERVANT.

18:10.610 --> 18:13.340
YOU WEAR
THAT WHITE SWEATSHIRT EVERYDAY.

18:13.380 --> 18:15.848
SHALL I TELL THE CLASS WHY?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.347
YOU.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.988
YOU, YOUNG MAN.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.726
A LITTLE ALOE WILL DO WONDERS
FOR THAT COMBINATION SKIN.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.449
AND PERHAPS YOU SHOULD USE
MORE CARE WHILE SHAVING.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.414
OR, JUST WAIT
UNTIL YOU CAN GROW

18:31.450 --> 18:32.781
FACIAL HAIR ALTOGETHER.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.617
[chuckles]

18:34.650 --> 18:36.823
YOU COULD'VE JUST SMELLED
MY AFTERSHAVE ON THE WAY IN.

18:36.860 --> 18:38.020
HOW 'BOUT A REAL TEST?

18:38.060 --> 18:39.368
I'LL WRITE THE ANSWER
ON THE BOARD.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.924
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE QUESTION.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.597
HAVE AT IT, YOUNG TREBEK.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.631
TREBEK, I SAID.

18:44.670 --> 18:45.671
THIS IS JEOPARDY!

18:45.710 --> 18:47.041
POTENT POTABLES.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.638
QUESTIONS THAT START WITH P.

18:48.680 --> 18:52.389
THE SMARTASS WHO THINKS HE'S
GONNA MAKE ME LOOK SILLY.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.419
WHO IS THIS GUY?

18:53.460 --> 18:54.654
[laughs]

19:06.120 --> 19:07.656
OOH!

19:07.690 --> 19:09.715
YOUR NEGATIVITY IS REALLY
IMPEDING MY PSYCHIC ABILITY.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.988
OR YOU'RE JUST A BIG FRAUD.

19:11.030 --> 19:11.894
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

19:11.930 --> 19:13.795
WAIT A SEC, COME ON.
GET OUT OF HERE, GO.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.639
GO.
GO, GET OUT OF HERE.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.934
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:17.970 --> 19:20.768
[door closes]

19:20.810 --> 19:22.744
NONE OF YOU SHOULD BE FRIENDS
WITH HIM.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.008
[softly]
PSST. HAHN.

19:24.050 --> 19:26.826
PROFESSOR HAHN.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.418
I'M GETTING SOMETHING FROM YOU.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.769
A KIND OF DARKNESS.
YES.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.564
I SEE YOU CLEARLY.

19:33.610 --> 19:35.635
WITH A TARGET.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.047
I SHOP AT TARGET.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.810
SURE, BUT, BUT, I...

19:41.860 --> 19:43.680
I SEE YOU ON A CELL PHONE
WITH YOUR COUSIN.

19:43.730 --> 19:45.823
PLOTTING, PLANNING.

19:45.860 --> 19:48.658
SOMETHING SECRET.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.702
YES.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.799
(Hahn)
YES, I'VE BEEN

19:52.840 --> 19:55.775
PLANNING A...

19:55.820 --> 19:57.788
SURPRISE PARTY
FOR MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

19:57.820 --> 20:01.187
SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SURPRISE.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.390
THAT'S AMAZING.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.447
YEAH, WELL,
IF SHE'S GONNA HAVE PUPPIES,

20:09.480 --> 20:10.242
SHE'S GONNA HAVE PUPPIES.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.838
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

20:11.880 --> 20:12.949
LOOK, IF YOU HAD HER FIXED
LIKE I--

20:15.990 --> 20:17.127
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.048
YES, ACTUALLY.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.567
WELL?
WELL, WHAT?

20:20.600 --> 20:21.760
WELL, ORDER ME OFF THE PHONE.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.734
YOU NEED ME TO WORK,
AND I'M WASTING TIME.

20:23.770 --> 20:25.829
THAT'S A NICE TOUCH.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.040
I'VE BEEN REVIEWING
THE STATEMENT WE TOOK

20:27.080 --> 20:29.071
FROM THE KIDS ON CAMPUS.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.883
THEY SAID
WHOEVER THIS TEACHER IS,

20:30.920 --> 20:32.649
HE'S ALREADY KILLED ONCE,
AND HE'S GOING TO KILL AGAIN.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.021
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.028
IT STRIKES ME THAT IT'S
DIFFICULT TO SOLVE A CRIME

20:36.060 --> 20:37.766
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET, SO

20:37.800 --> 20:40.030
WHY DON'T WE FOCUS OUR ATTENTION
ON THE MURDER THAT ALREADY HAS?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.805
THESE ARE THE CASE FILES
FOR EVERY UNSOLVED HOMICIDE

20:44.850 --> 20:46.943
IN THE SANTA BARBARA AREA
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.878
LOT OF PAPER CUTS THERE.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.683
HAVE FUN.
NO.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.948
I NEED YOU TO REVIEW THESE

20:53.000 --> 20:54.536
AND TELL ME
IF THERE ARE ANY CONNECTIONS

20:54.570 --> 20:55.798
WITH THE MEITNER FACULTY.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.068
YEAH...

20:57.110 --> 20:58.099
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.938
YOU DELEGATE THIS BACKGROUND
STUFF ALL THE TIME.

21:00.980 --> 21:01.878
TO ME, USUALLY.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.184
ALMOST ALWAYS
WHEN I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.653
NOW.

21:05.690 --> 21:06.884
GO THROUGH THESE
WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB

21:06.930 --> 21:08.659
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU FIND.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.758
[softly]
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.859
O'HARA, YOU ARE DRUNK
WITH POWER.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.959
I KNOW!
ISN'T IT GREAT?

21:21.720 --> 21:24.029
(Shawn)
AND THAT AMAZING DEMONSTRATION

21:24.060 --> 21:25.027
IS PHSYSICS AT WORK.

21:25.060 --> 21:27.119
IT'S LIKE THINKING OF A SONG,
AND THEN, BAM!

21:27.170 --> 21:28.364
IT'S THE NEXT TUNE
ON THE RADIO.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.131
OR...OR THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU
KNOW IT'S RIGHT TO KISS A GIRL.

21:32.180 --> 21:33.033
THAT'S WHEN YOU USE THE POWER.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.638
[Gus clearing throat]

21:34.680 --> 21:37.114
PROFESSOR HAHN.

21:37.150 --> 21:38.788
I'M STILL SENSING
SOMETHING FROM--

21:38.820 --> 21:40.128
UM, PROFESSOR?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.149
CALL ME SENSEI.

21:41.190 --> 21:42.327
HOW CAN WE HARNESS--
(Shawn)
UH, UH, UH.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.022
SENSEI.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.059
SENSEI.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.067
YES.

21:47.110 --> 21:49.806
HOW CAN WE HARNESS THIS POWER
TO HELP US UM...

21:49.840 --> 21:51.171
KISS GIRLS?

21:51.210 --> 21:52.108
[Gus laughs]

21:52.150 --> 21:53.708
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE, SHAWN.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.012
OH, I DON'T KNOW, GUS.

21:55.050 --> 21:56.210
NOW MAY NOT BE THE TIME
TO IMPEDE

21:56.260 --> 21:57.227
THEIR PSYCHO-SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT.

21:57.260 --> 21:59.091
WELL, MAYBE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

21:59.130 --> 21:59.926
THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK

21:59.960 --> 22:02.099
THE HOTTEST GIRL
IN SCHOOL TO THE PROM.

22:02.140 --> 22:04.199
THAT'S BECAUSE I TOLD HER
YOU WERE DYING.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.800
OTHERWISE, I WOULD HAVE HAD
TO PAY FOR THE LIMO MYSELF.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.683
LET ME TAKE THIS, PLEASE.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.382
GUS, MY FERRY.

22:12.420 --> 22:14.285
THANK YOU, SHAWN.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.038
NOW, KISSING SOMEONE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

22:19.070 --> 22:20.230
CAN BE TRICKY BUSINESS.

22:20.270 --> 22:21.874
I LIKE TO EMPLOY

22:21.910 --> 22:23.241
THE KADEEM HARDISON METHOD.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.078
WHEN YOU'RE ON A DATE--

22:26.120 --> 22:28.714
UH, UH, I CAN SENSE A QUESTION
FORMING IN ALL OF YOUR MINDS.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.988
IF IT'S
"WHO IS KADEEM HARDISON?"

22:30.020 --> 22:31.851
OR "HOW DO WE ASK SOMEONE
ON A DATE?"

22:31.900 --> 22:32.958
PUT 'EM DOWN.

22:37.510 --> 22:38.909
LISTEN, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.202
JUST LOOK AT THIS CLASS.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.308
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF DUDES.

22:41.350 --> 22:43.818
UM, WE'RE GIRLS.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.418
THAT'S AWKWARD.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.052
[bell rings]

22:49.100 --> 22:52.035
I'LL COVER ALL THE DATING STUFF
IN MY NEXT SEMINAR.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.335
"PUBERTY: MONSTER OR
MISUNDERSTOOD FRIEND?"

22:55.380 --> 22:59.373
THAT KID I SENT TO THE OFFICE
HAD SOME WEIRD ZIT CREAM ON.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.082
PROFESSOR ENRICO.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.849
[laughs]

23:05.430 --> 23:06.465
GUSTER.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.922
BURTON GUSTER.

23:07.970 --> 23:08.994
YOU INTERVIEWED ME
FOR ADMISSION?

23:09.040 --> 23:10.132
MATH PRODIGY?

23:10.170 --> 23:11.501
I INTERVIEW PEOPLE
ALL THE TIME.

23:11.540 --> 23:12.905
WAS THIS RECENTLY?

23:12.940 --> 23:14.441
SEMI-RECENT.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.209
20 YEARS AGO.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.115
BUT I TAP-DANCED
IN TROCHAIC TETRAM ETER.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.388
MADE YOU WANNA CRY.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.321
THAT RINGS A BELL.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.021
SO...VISITING
THE OLD ALMA MATER?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.288
NO, I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

23:26.340 --> 23:27.830
REALLY?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.336
COULD'VE SWORN
I RECOMMENDED ADMISSION.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.608
EITHER WAY,

23:30.650 --> 23:31.878
I ASSUME A PERSON

23:31.920 --> 23:34.013
WITH YOUR SKILLS
ENDED UP AT JPL

23:34.050 --> 23:36.314
OR SOME KIND OF THINK TANK?

23:36.360 --> 23:39.352
ACTUALLY, I ENDED UP
IN PHARMACEUTICALS.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.369
YOU KNOW...
CURING STUFF.

23:45.270 --> 23:47.147
WELL,
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

23:47.180 --> 23:49.410
THANK YOU.

23:49.450 --> 23:50.178
DUDE.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.087
YOU DIDN'T EVEN MENTION
MAGICHEAD.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.325
GUYS, WE'RE FREAKING OUT.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.520
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
PROFESSOR HAHN IS OUR GUY.

23:56.570 --> 23:58.299
SO TURN HIM IN
TO THE COPS.

23:58.330 --> 23:59.536
NOT WITHOUT PROOF.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.470
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?

24:01.510 --> 24:02.636
THE ONLY TIME WE SEE HIM
IS WHEN HE GETS HIS ESPRESSO

24:02.680 --> 24:04.238
IN THE MORNING
BEFORE HOMEROOM.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.611
THERE'S AN ESPRESSO BAR
HERE ON CAMPUS?

24:05.650 --> 24:08.153
WAIT! WASN'T HAHN
INVOLVED IN THAT THING?

24:08.190 --> 24:09.282
YOU REMEMBER THAT THING?

24:09.320 --> 24:10.389
THE THING WITH THE OTHER THING?
NO, NO.

24:10.430 --> 24:13.058
JUST THE FIRST THING
FROM FIVE YEARS AGO.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.192
WHEN THE STUDENT ATTACKED
THE PROFESSOR?

24:14.230 --> 24:16.369
OH, YEAH,
THAT COULD'VE BEEN HAHN.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.606
SOME STUDENT ATTACKED HAHN
AND HE MADE SURE

24:17.640 --> 24:19.039
THE HEADMASTER EXPELLED HIM.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.377
WHO'S THE STUDENT
THAT ATTACKED HIM?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.956
ACCORDING
TO THE SCHOOL COMPUTERS,

24:24.990 --> 24:26.412
THE ONLY KID TO BE EXPELLED
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

24:26.460 --> 24:28.997
WAS A LESTER BAEKELAND.

24:29.030 --> 24:29.997
[grunts]

24:30.030 --> 24:31.531
[coughing]

24:34.410 --> 24:36.435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.040
GETTING THE PLAGUE,
APPARENTLY.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.116
GOD.

24:41.150 --> 24:44.426
BABCOCK, BABETTE,
BATTRA SOMETHING...

24:44.460 --> 24:46.451
BAEKELAND.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.139
GOD.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.398
I CAN SEE WHY YOU WANTED
TO GO HERE, GUS.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.499
THEY KEEP METICULOUS RECORDS
OF EVERYTHING JUST LIKE YOU.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.541
MM-HMM.

24:53.580 --> 24:54.478
EXPELLED FOR CHEATING.

24:54.510 --> 24:56.683
DUDE, THERE'S A TRANSCRIPT
OF HIS HEARING.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.381
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

24:58.420 --> 25:00.559
THE KID CLAIMED HAHN BUSTED HIM
FOR CHEATING,

25:00.590 --> 25:02.990
THEN TRIED TO EXTORT
HIS SCHOLARSHIP MONEY

25:03.000 --> 25:05.423
FROM HIM TO STAY QUIET.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.734
HAHN DENIES IT.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.579
HEADMASTER, OF COURSE, SIDES
WITH THE TEACHER.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.043
THE KID GETS EXPELLED.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.408
HUH.

25:14.450 --> 25:16.657
WELL, THAT MEANS HAHN
IS A BLACKMAILER.

25:16.690 --> 25:19.090
MAYBE HE THREATENED
THE WRONG PERSON THIS TIME.

25:23.270 --> 25:26.103
GUS?

25:26.140 --> 25:27.448
GUS.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.141
I GOT IN.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.681
I APPLIED,

25:30.720 --> 25:32.210
AND I GOT IN.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.557
THAT MEANS A LOT, BUDDY.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.421
YOU'D RATHER STAY
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND

25:35.460 --> 25:36.597
THAN, YOU KNOW,
HAVE A FUTURE.

25:36.630 --> 25:37.699
NO, SHAWN.

25:37.730 --> 25:39.766
IT SAYS, "PARENTS OF APPLICANT
REFUSED ADMISSION."

25:39.800 --> 25:41.438
IF I'D KNOWN I'D GOTTEN IN,

25:41.470 --> 25:42.471
I WOULD'VE BEEN GHOST.

25:42.510 --> 25:45.445
THIS PLACE HAS A DIRECT LINE
TO THE IW LEAGUE.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.345
WHY WOULD MY PARENTS
TURN IT DOWN?

25:47.390 --> 25:49.585
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT WAS
JUST TOO EXPENSIVE.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.723
I COULD'VE GOTTEN
FINANCIAL AID, SHAWN.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.297
HALF THE KIDS HERE ARE
ON SCHOLARSHIPS WITH STIPENDS.

25:53.330 --> 25:54.627
CAN WE NOT OBSESS
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

25:54.670 --> 25:56.194
WE DO HAVE A MURDER
TO PREVENT.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.662
I'M NOT OBSESSING, SHAWN.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.530
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT THE COURSE OF MY LIFE

25:59.580 --> 26:00.706
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED
BY MY PARENTS.

26:00.750 --> 26:01.899
YOU'VE SEEN SLIDING DOORS.

26:01.950 --> 26:03.110
I MOST CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.
YES, YOU DID.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.657
DUDE, I HAVE NOT SEEN
SLIDING DOORS.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.759
IT WAS ME, YOU,
AND MISSY ISAACS.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.257
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:08.290 --> 26:10.622
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A GWYNETH PALTROW VEHICLE

26:10.670 --> 26:11.659
THAT I KNOW I NEVER SAW.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.531
PLEASE.

26:13.570 --> 26:16.277
I KNOW YOU'RE HOME.
THIS IS MY FIFTH MESSAGE.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.244
CALL ME BACK.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.680
THEY'RE JUST SCREENING MY CALLS
UNTIL I'VE LET THIS GO.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.688
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.256
GUS, LET'S FACE IT.

26:24.290 --> 26:26.190
YOUR PARENTS THOUGHT
SPLITTING US UP AT A YOUNG AGE

26:26.230 --> 26:27.265
WAS A MISTAKE.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.689
AND I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME THEM.

26:29.740 --> 26:31.435
FOR A WHILE, I WAS YOUR ONLY
FRIEND THAT WASN'T IMAGINARY

26:31.470 --> 26:32.801
OR AN ACTION FIGURE
OF SOME KIND.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.398
SHAWN, IF ANYTHING,

26:34.450 --> 26:35.815
MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO STAY
IN PUBLIC SCHOOL

26:35.850 --> 26:38.318
SO THAT I WOULD STAND OUT
COMPARED TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.419
YEAH.
NO HOLES IN THAT THEORY.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.722
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.727
MY PARENTS DODGING MY CALLS,

26:42.760 --> 26:44.694
OR YOU VOLUNTEERING ME
TO PICK UP A MURDERER

26:44.730 --> 26:45.628
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.639
DUDE, IT IS YOUR TURN
TO DRIVE THE CARPOOL.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.772
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

26:49.810 --> 26:51.641
TODAY IS MURDER DAY.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.411
SPEAKING OF MURDER DAY, IS THAT
REALLY WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

26:55.450 --> 26:56.758
SHAWN, IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES,

26:56.790 --> 26:58.997
WE'RE GONNA BE IN A CONFINED
SPACE WITH A KILLER.

26:59.030 --> 27:00.622
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON.

27:00.670 --> 27:02.467
OF COURSE I HAVE
A GOOD REASON, GUS.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.502
THIS TIME, IT'LL BE JUST YOU,
ME, AND HIM,

27:04.540 --> 27:07.805
AND I WILL TOTALLY BREAK
HIM DOWN.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.786
THAT'S HAHN'S HOUSE.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.762
OR...

27:20.810 --> 27:23.802
MAYBE IT'LL JUST BE
YOU AND ME.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.568
WELL, ACCORDING TO OUR ARSON
INVESTIGATOR,

27:35.600 --> 27:37.534
HERE IS OUR MURDERER.

27:37.570 --> 27:40.744
APPARENTLY, THERE WAS A SLIGHT
GAS LEAK IN THE STOVE.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.475
OVERNIGHT, THE ROOM FILLS
WITH NATURAL GAS,

27:42.520 --> 27:43.509
THE COFFEE POT CLICKS ON
IN THE MORNING,

27:43.550 --> 27:45.518
THERE'S A SPARK,
AND KA-BOOM.

27:45.550 --> 27:48.622
NO, I'M SENSING IT WAS
DEFINITELY MORE OF A KA-BLAM.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.009
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT?

27:54.040 --> 27:57.544
ARSON INVESTIGATOR SAYS
THERE'S NO SIGN OF FOUL PLAY.

27:57.580 --> 27:59.673
THE ONLY TIME WE SEE HIM
IS WHEN HE GETS HIS ESPRESSO

27:59.720 --> 28:00.846
IN THE MORNING
BEFORE HOMEROOM.

28:00.890 --> 28:03.358
WAIT, I'M HAVING A VISION.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.851
HAHN PREFERRED ITALIAN COFFEE.
ESPRESSO.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.697
(Gus)
WHY WOULD HE BE BREWING COFFEE

28:07.730 --> 28:09.869
HERE IF HE WAS GONNA GET HIS FIX
IN THE MORNING AT SCHOOL?

28:09.900 --> 28:12.676
I'M SENSING OUR KILLER BROUGHT
THE COFFEE MACHINE HERE

28:12.710 --> 28:15.679
AND USED IT AS A DETONATOR
AFTER CREATING THE GAS LEAK.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.744
WHAT KILLER, SPENCER?

28:16.790 --> 28:18.041
OUR EXPERT SAYS
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.489
I SAY MURDER.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.056
IT'S WHAT DREW ME
TO THIS WRETCHED PLACE.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.728
TALK TO THE GIRL
WHO MAKES THE ESPRESSO.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.069
I USUALLY DON'T DO THIS,

28:25.100 --> 28:26.761
BUT I HAVE A STRONG SENSE
SHE'LL BACK THIS UP.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.735
HAHN HAD A CUP
FIRST THING EVERY MORNING.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.145
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THOSE COFFEE PEOPLE?

28:31.180 --> 28:33.740
THEY'RE NOT CASHIERS.
THEY'RE NOT WAITRESSES.

28:33.790 --> 28:35.587
BARISTA.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.986
GUS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWER, DON'T MAKE UP WORDS.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.048
DUDE, HAHN WAS BROKE.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.159
NO WONDER HE'S A BLACKMAILER.

28:52.190 --> 28:55.057
THE DUE DATE FOR THE PAYMENT
IS THE SAME AS MURDER DAY.

28:55.090 --> 28:56.057
[whispering]
COINCIDENCE?

28:56.100 --> 28:57.522
I THINK NOT.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.398
(Shockley)
IT WAS STATICKY.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.171
BUT WE HEARD A DEEP, GRAVELLY
VOICE TALKING TO THEIR COUSIN.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.871
SOMEONE NAMED MURIEL.

29:10.890 --> 29:13.597
WE ARE SO ON THIS CASE NOW.

29:16.870 --> 29:18.201
IT'S YOUR CALL, O'HARA.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.901
EITHER IT'S AN ACCIDENT
AND WE'RE DONE,

29:19.940 --> 29:22.317
OR IT'S A HOMICIDE, AND THERE'S
A KILLER ON THE LOOSE.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.284
I DON'T BUY THIS ACCIDENT ANGLE
FOR A SECOND.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.584
THOSE KIDS PRACTICALLY SAID
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.850
LET'S BRING THEM BACK IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.766
IF YOU CONFESS NOW,

29:34.810 --> 29:36.209
NAME YOUR ACCOMPLICES,

29:36.240 --> 29:38.845
I WILL LET THE D.A. KNOW
THAT YOU COOPERATED.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.781
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
NO GUARANTEES.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.856
JUST MAYBE...

29:43.890 --> 29:45.050
THEY'LL CUT YOU A BREAK.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.338
IT'S TERRIBLE.

29:53.380 --> 29:54.369
WHAT?

29:54.410 --> 29:56.071
AM I SCARED?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.087
AM I QUAKING?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.985
NO, THAT WAS WHAT I CALL

29:59.020 --> 30:00.055
LOWER CASE MAD.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.352
YOU NEED TO BE

30:01.390 --> 30:03.051
UPPER CASE MAD.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.903
THOSE STRANGE KIDS
ARE IN INTERROGATION B.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.344
LISTEN, O'HARA.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.415
GIVEN YOUR SLIGHTLY

30:14.450 --> 30:15.747
PEDESTRIAN PERFORMANCE,

30:15.790 --> 30:17.678
AND THE FACT
THAT THIS HAS NOW JUMPED

30:17.730 --> 30:20.119
TO A STRAIGHT-UP HOMICIDE, MAYBE
I SHOULD TAKE OVER AS LEAD.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.969
BUT, WHY?
IT'S MY CASE.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.661
WHICH WAS FINE WHEN IT WAS JUST
KIDS TELLING TALES, BUT THERE

30:23.710 --> 30:27.271
ARE CERTAIN NUANCES INVOLVED
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION

30:27.310 --> 30:30.040
WHICH REQUIRE A MORE
EXPERIENCED TOUCH.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.685
NUANCES THE CHIEF SAYS
I'LL LEARN BY BEING PRIMARY.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.823
YEAH, BUT...

30:33.860 --> 30:35.748
BUT WHAT?
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.792
I'VE NEVER HAD A CASE
WITH AN EXPLOSION BEFORE.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.432
I'VE HAD ASSAULT
AND BURGLARY CASES.

30:40.470 --> 30:41.835
ONCE I EVEN HAD
A MURDER BY THERMOMETER.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.745
BUT I NEVER HAD
AN EXPLOSION.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.407
I MEAN, COME ON, HAVEN'T YOU
EVER PICTURED YOURSELF

30:45.450 --> 30:47.816
TRYING TO OUTRUN A FIREBALL
DOWN A DARK TUNNEL?

30:47.850 --> 30:51.126
NO.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.337
OBVIOUSLY, DUE TO RECENT EVENTS,
WE ARE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK

30:57.370 --> 30:59.201
AT EVERYTHING
SURROUNDING THE SCHOOL,

30:59.240 --> 31:01.470
INCLUDING THE STATEMENT
YOU GAVE TO US.

31:01.510 --> 31:03.717
YOU MEAN WHEN WE PREDICTED
SOMEONE WAS GOING TO DIE TODAY?

31:03.720 --> 31:05.187
AND THEY DID?

31:05.220 --> 31:06.448
WELL, THAT.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.128
AND...
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, KID.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.457
OKAY,
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.353
WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.526
WHAT HE MEANS

31:11.570 --> 31:13.959
IS...

31:14.010 --> 31:15.500
PLEASE TELL US AGAIN ABOUT
THE PHONE CALL YOU OVERHEARD.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.438
NO.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.971
TELL US ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HAHN.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.476
YOU LITTLE SON OF A--

31:20.520 --> 31:22.886
LASSITER, STOP.
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.148
WE'RE SORRY.

31:24.190 --> 31:26.454
LESSON 63.
DO NOT APOLOGIZE TO THE PERP.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.161
THEY'RE NOT PERPS.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.339
YOU TWO AREN'T REALLY ACQUAINTED
WITH GAME THEORY

31:30.370 --> 31:32.076
OR PRISONER'S DILEMMA,
ARE YOU?

31:32.110 --> 31:34.408
HUH?
(Shockley)
HE MEANS YOU TWO DON'T REALLY

31:34.450 --> 31:35.269
GET THE GOOD COP
BAD COP DYAD.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.449
(Goddard)
ARE YOU GUYS, LIKE, TOGETHER?

31:37.490 --> 31:39.310
NO, SHE'S
WAY OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.554
BUT NO RING.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.922
GIVEN HIS AGE,
I'M GUESSING DIVORCED.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.064
1--
SORRY. WHAT?

31:45.100 --> 31:46.465
STILL CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.569
SO IT'S RELATIVELY RECENT THEN?

31:47.600 --> 31:49.374
I'M GETTING SEPARATED.

31:49.410 --> 31:50.570
NOT DIVORCED.

31:50.610 --> 31:51.508
DID YOU EVER JUST LISTEN
TO HER PROBLEMS,

31:51.550 --> 31:53.518
RATHER THAN ALWAYS
TRYING TO SOLVE THEM?

31:53.550 --> 31:55.484
NO, YOU HAD TO BE
THE BIG TOUGH COP, DIDN'T YOU?

31:55.520 --> 31:56.509
YOU NEVER LET HER INSIDE.

31:59.660 --> 32:01.366
SEE THIS, BRAINIAC?

32:01.400 --> 32:03.436
THIS IS WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU
WHEN YOU TURN 18.

32:03.470 --> 32:05.506
YOU'RE GONNA GRADUATE,
AND GET YOUR DIPLOMA,

32:05.540 --> 32:06.609
AND THEN, BAM!

32:06.640 --> 32:08.073
WE'RE TAKING A TRIP DOWN

32:08.110 --> 32:09.270
TO THE DOCKS.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.447
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
VERY INTIMIDATING WITH, UH,

32:11.490 --> 32:12.514
YOU KNOW, THE ONE ARM.

32:15.590 --> 32:16.591
[inhales sharply]

32:29.360 --> 32:31.555
WHEN DID MY HOUSE BECOME
A DAYCARE CENTER?

32:31.590 --> 32:34.468
DAD, YOU'VE BEEN BUGGING ME FOR
MONTHS TO FIX YOUR COMPUTER.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.229
I FINALLY BRING THE GEEK SQUAD
IN TO DO IT,

32:36.270 --> 32:38.135
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
A HARD TIME?

32:38.170 --> 32:40.570
THANK YOU.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.703
HAHN HAD
SOM EON E'S JUVENILE RECORD.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.388
MAYBE HE DUG UP SOMETHING
ON OUR KILLER'S PAST,

32:44.420 --> 32:47.025
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO HACK
INTO THE JUVIE DATABASE.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.152
YEAH, I'M WITH YOU
EXCEPT FOR THE PART

32:48.190 --> 32:49.350
ABOUT COMING TO MY DAD'S HOUSE.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.664
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE KIDS,
THE HACKING MAY COME BACK TO US.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.339
NOW THE AUTHORITIES WILL BE LED
TO AN ANTIQUE COMPUTER

32:54.370 --> 32:55.632
PURCHASED BY A FORMER COP.

32:55.670 --> 32:57.444
CAN YOU SAY WILD GOOSE CHASE?

32:57.480 --> 32:59.311
JEEZ, THIS COMPUTER
IS ANCIENT.

32:59.350 --> 33:03.013
I DIDN'T REALIZE COLECOVISION
WAS STILL IN BUSINESS.

33:03.060 --> 33:03.958
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.723
MURIEL JUVENILE HALL

33:05.760 --> 33:07.466
SLASH HALFWAY HOUSE.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.161
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

33:09.200 --> 33:13.409
I'M SENSING OUR INVESTIGATION
CENTERS ON THE YEAR 1991.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.044
'91?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.741
THERE'S NOTHING
BUT A BUNCH OF PHOTOS HERE.

33:16.780 --> 33:18.281
CLICK ON THE TOP RIGHT.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.423
THAT'S THAT KID I SENT
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.438
KIRK GODEL.

33:26.470 --> 33:27.437
WHY THE HELL IS A PHOTO
FROM TODAY MIXED IN

33:27.470 --> 33:29.279
WITH PHOTOS FROM '91?

33:29.310 --> 33:30.470
IT'S NOT.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.513
THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN
15 YEARS AGO.

33:39.830 --> 33:41.764
I'M HAVING A VISION.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.109
THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.074
EDDIE MACON'S RUN.

33:46.110 --> 33:47.805
SPARTACUS.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.569
KIRK DOUGLAS!
YES.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.383
SEE IF THERE'S A STUDENT
NAMED KIRK.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.685
THE REGISTRAR GAVE ME ACCESS
TO ALL THEIR FILES.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.288
[sighs]

33:56.330 --> 33:57.490
IT'S PERFECT LY NORMAL,
YOU KNOW.

33:57.530 --> 33:58.690
WHAT IS?

33:58.730 --> 34:00.561
THE ANXIETY
OF BEING IN CHARGE.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.773
I CAN SENSE YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT
OF THE WORLD ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

34:02.810 --> 34:06.644
I JUST REALLY WANNA
GET THIS RIGHT.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.739
OH.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.712
KIRK GODEL.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.899
GODEL.

34:12.930 --> 34:14.329
IT'S ALMOST PRONOUNCED
LIKE GIRDLE

34:14.370 --> 34:17.191
BECAUSE OF THE OMELET
ON THE "0."

34:17.240 --> 34:19.208
PRETTY SURE
THAT'S AN UMLAUT.
I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.174
LET'S SEE.
NO JUVENILE RECORD, ONLY CHILD.

34:21.210 --> 34:23.610
ALL STATS MATCH UP
WITH HIS SCHOOL RECORDS.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.481
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.612
LET'S SEE WHAT GOOGLE SAYS.

34:26.660 --> 34:28.651
UH, SEARCH IT
WITH THE WORD MURIEL.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.419
[typing]

34:30.460 --> 34:33.463
OH, HERE'S AN ARTICLE FROM
THE MURIEL COUNTY NEWSLETTER.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.933
ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE,

34:34.970 --> 34:38.804
KIRK GODEL AND HIS PARENTS
DIED FIVE YEARS AGO

34:38.850 --> 34:40.738
IN A CAR CRASH.

34:40.780 --> 34:41.883
THERE SHOULD BE A DEATH
CERTIFICATE ON FILE.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.751
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF IT.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.554
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

34:46.600 --> 34:49.763
A LITTLE ALOE WILL DO WONDERS
FOR THAT COMBINATION SKIN.

34:51.710 --> 34:53.200
CIRCLE YOUR HORSES, JULES.

34:53.240 --> 34:55.401
WE'RE ABOUT TO CRACK
YOUR CASE LIKE AN EGG.

34:56.950 --> 34:59.783
AND THEN,
WE'LL MAKE SOME UMLAUTS.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.981
WITH SHALLOTS.

35:02.030 --> 35:03.224
AND JUSTICE.

35:06.870 --> 35:07.962
(Shawn)
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.619
GOOD, I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL
ON TIME FOR PHSYSICS TWO.

35:12.650 --> 35:14.584
THE WRATH OF KHAN.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.657
TODAY'S LECTURE WILL COVER
COMEUPPANCE.

35:17.690 --> 35:20.818
AND HOW TO SOLVE A CRIME
IN A CROWDED ROOM.

35:20.860 --> 35:24.261
SOMEONE HERE
IS LIVING A LIE.

35:24.310 --> 35:26.904
SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM

35:26.940 --> 35:28.498
IS A GHOST-FACED KILLAH.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.919
IT'S NOT YOU.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.952
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE HAIR IMMEDIATELY.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.968
OKAY?
I'D START NOW.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.934
YOU.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.801
YOUR HEART IS PURE.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.478
I'D SAY LOSE THE EARRING,

35:44.510 --> 35:45.772
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK
HE PULLS IT OFF.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.346
MM.

35:48.990 --> 35:51.686
BUT YOU.

35:51.730 --> 35:53.425
Y--

35:53.460 --> 35:54.722
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS RUN?

35:54.770 --> 35:57.830
DON'T THEY KNOW
IT MAKES THEM LOOK GUILTY?

35:57.870 --> 36:00.771
YOU NEED THIS GUY?

36:00.810 --> 36:01.947
THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.312
HAVE A SEAT.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.357
YOU MIND TELLING US
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

36:07.390 --> 36:09.858
WELL, AS THE BEAUTIFUL,
INDUSTRIOUS,

36:09.900 --> 36:11.697
DETECTIVE O'HARA
HAS ALREADY GATHERED...

36:11.730 --> 36:13.869
YOU'RE NOT THE REAL KIRK GODEL,
ARE YOU?

36:13.900 --> 36:15.868
WILL THE REAL KIRK GODEL
PLEASE STAND UP?

36:15.910 --> 36:17.434
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.799
YOU STOLE
THE REAL KIRK GODEL'S IDENTITY

36:18.850 --> 36:20.772
SO THAT YOU COULD
GET INTO THIS SCHOOL.

36:20.820 --> 36:21.912
[gasp5]

36:21.950 --> 36:24.680
BUT THERE'S MORE TO THIS CASE
THAN STOLEN IDENTITY.

36:24.730 --> 36:30.589
YES, I'M SENSING A MUCH DARKER,
DIABOLICAL PAST.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.039
(Shawn)
YOU DID A STINT IN JUVIE

36:32.070 --> 36:34.641
FOR CAUSING SOMEONE'S DEATH.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.478
15 YEARS AGO.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.987
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?
HE'S A KID.
TRUE.

36:39.020 --> 36:42.023
SO HOW COULD
THIS BE POSSIBLE, CLASS?

36:42.060 --> 36:43.721
TIME TRAVEL.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.523
HE CRYOGENICALLY FROZE HIMSELF

36:45.570 --> 36:46.639
IN ORDER TO TRAVEL
TO THE FUTURE.

36:46.670 --> 36:49.901
NO.
HE'S A CLONE OF THE ORIGINAL.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.079
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST NEVER MIND, GUYS.

36:52.110 --> 36:54.112
SAVE IT
FOR YOUR ONLINE ROLE PLAYING.

37:04.070 --> 37:04.434
HE'S WEARING MAKE-UP.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.135
IS HE GAY?

37:06.170 --> 37:08.001
NO.

37:08.050 --> 37:09.244
WELL, MAYBE.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.145
LOOK, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.648
BUT THE REASON
HE'S WEARING MAKE-UP

37:13.690 --> 37:15.920
IS BECAUSE HE IS ACTUALLY 30,

37:15.960 --> 37:17.962
TRYING TO PASS
FOR A TEENAGER.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.797
30?

37:19.840 --> 37:21.603
WHAT KIND OF MOISTURIZER
DO YOU USE?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.278
(Shawn)
CLASS, I WOULD ADVISE YOU
TAKE NOTES.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.039
THERE WILL BE
A TEST ON THIS.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.014
[paper riffling]

37:29.020 --> 37:31.682
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE SMARTEST
KID IN YOUR CLASS,

37:31.730 --> 37:33.220
BUT WITH JUVIE ON YOUR RECORD,
YOU COULDN'T GET INTO COLLEGE.

37:33.260 --> 37:34.727
[paper crumpling]

37:34.770 --> 37:37.739
THEN ONE DAY, YOU READ
A STORY ABOUT A 15 YEAR OLD

37:37.770 --> 37:40.136
FROM YOUR HOMETOWN
WHO DIED IN A FIERY CAR CRASH.

37:40.180 --> 37:43.638
AND THAT
WAS THE REAL KIRK GODEL.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.841
AND YOU HAD
A LIGHT BULB MOMENT.

37:45.890 --> 37:47.585
ALL YOUR LIFE, PEOPLE THOUGHT

37:47.630 --> 37:49.257
YOU WERE YOUNGER
THAN YOU LOOKED,

37:49.300 --> 37:52.167
SO YOU DECIDED
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

37:52.200 --> 37:55.135
AND HIT A HUGE RE-SET BUTTON
ON YOUR LIFE.

37:55.170 --> 37:57.638
YOU FORGED KIRK'S DOCUMENTS.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.102
THEN YOU WENT ONLINE AND
DELETED HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE.

37:59.150 --> 38:01.209
A NEW IDENTITY

38:01.250 --> 38:03.184
PLUS YOUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE
MEANT YOU WERE

38:03.220 --> 38:04.551
A CINCH TO MAKE MEITNER.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.721
NOW YOU WOULD GRADUATE FROM ONE
OF THE BEST HIGH SCHOOLS

38:06.760 --> 38:11.129
IN THE COUNTRY,
GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO THE IWs,

38:11.170 --> 38:12.330
AND BECOME A YOUNG CAPTAIN
OF INDUSTRY.

38:12.370 --> 38:13.974
AND IT WAS ALL ROLLING ALONG

38:14.010 --> 38:14.908
BEAUTIFULLY UNTIL..

38:14.950 --> 38:18.647
HAHN DISCOVERED
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.715
HE BLACKMAILED YOU
FOR YOUR SCHOLARSHIP STIPEND.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.250
HE NEEDED MONEY

38:22.290 --> 38:24.099
TO MAKE A BANK PAYMENT
BY WEDNESDAY,

38:24.130 --> 38:26.269
MONEY YOU WEREN'T WILLING
TO PAY.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.234
YOU WERE SO DISTRAUGHT,
YOU CALLED YOUR COUSIN

38:28.270 --> 38:29.362
TO VENT.

38:29.410 --> 38:32.777
YOU DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY
OUT WAS TO KILL HAHN,

38:32.810 --> 38:35.187
AND MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.154
[beeping]

38:37.190 --> 38:38.987
FINALLY,

38:39.030 --> 38:42.693
YOU HACKED IN AND DELETED ALL
RECORDS THAT YOU WERE EVER

38:42.740 --> 38:43.695
IN JUVIE.

38:43.740 --> 38:46.971
BRILLIANT UNTIL THE END.

38:47.010 --> 38:48.705
WELL, UNTIL THIS...
UNTIL THIS LAST PART.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.843
WHEN YOU GOT CAUGHT.

38:50.880 --> 38:54.259
ON THE WILD LINE.
LIKE A SALMON.

38:58.270 --> 38:59.862
PENCILS DOWN.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.345
COME ON.

39:04.380 --> 39:05.802
CUFF HIM, O'HARA.

39:05.850 --> 39:08.182
HERE, USE MINE.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.711
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.057
ANYTHING ELSE
I NEED TO LEARN?

39:12.090 --> 39:13.819
THERE'S ONE LAST LESSON.

39:13.860 --> 39:16.897
FORGET ALL THE OTHER LESSONS
AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

39:23.050 --> 39:25.985
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA NEED
THOSE CUFFS BACK, RIGHT?

39:26.020 --> 39:29.023
GOOD.

39:36.010 --> 39:36.999
MARTINSDALE.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.371
MACEN DALE.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.048
JAY MACEN DALE.

39:40.080 --> 39:43.186
ONCE WE HAD THE NAME, IT WAS
PRETTY EASY TO TRACK THE REST.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.154
WHEN HE WAS 15,
HE STOLE A CAR ON A DARE,

39:45.190 --> 39:46.896
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
A PEDESTRIAN.

39:46.930 --> 39:48.227
AND THAT'S
WHAT GOT HIM IN JUVIE.

39:48.270 --> 39:49.294
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE PASSED HIMSELF OFF

39:49.330 --> 39:50.297
AS A TEENAGER FOR THIS LONG.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.967
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

39:52.010 --> 39:54.444
SLAP A WIG ON YOU, YOU'RE
THE SPITTING IMAGE OF YOURSELF

39:54.480 --> 39:56.368
WHEN I WAS A KID.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.217
(Gus)
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

39:58.250 --> 39:59.342
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

39:59.390 --> 40:01.153
HE FINALLY GOT A HOLD
OF HIS PARENTS.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.327
(Gus)
DON'T TELL ME
IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.191
MY FILE SAID I QUALIFIED
FOR FINANCIAL AID.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.266
QUALITY OF LIFE?

40:06.300 --> 40:09.201
THEY HAVE
24-7 SLUSHY MACHINES THERE.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.275
THE LOCKERS ARE MADE WITH TEAK.

40:10.310 --> 40:12.107
THAT'S THE STRONGEST WOOD.

40:12.150 --> 40:13.242
THESE PIECES LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE HAND-CARVED, SHAWN.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.440
WHAT'S WITH THE GENEROSITY?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.619
I SAW YOU WERE STILL USING
THE RATTY BOARD

40:16.660 --> 40:18.184
WITH THE PLASTIC PIECES

40:18.230 --> 40:21.290
SO I WENT AHEAD
AND SHOPLIFTED THIS FOR YOU.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.992
I'M KIDDING.
I BOUGHT IT.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.304
THOSE KID GENIUSES TURNED ME
ON TO A GREAT IPO.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.446
NOW, REMEMBER, I WIN,
I GET THE TRUCK FOR A WEEK.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.155
ALL RIGHT, HOW 'BOUT, I WIN,
YOU WASH THE TRUCK FOR A WEEK?

40:33.190 --> 40:35.181
YEAH, I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS.

40:35.230 --> 40:36.629
I'M OUT THERE
IN A PAIR OF JEAN SHORTS

40:36.660 --> 40:37.649
SHAWN...
CONTINUOUSLY WASHING

40:37.700 --> 40:39.361
THE VEHICLE FOR A--
FOCUS.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.367
FOCUS.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.971
(Gus)
TOO FAR TO DRIVE?

40:43.010 --> 40:45.274
YOU DERAILED MY FUTURE
BECAUSE DAD HATES CURW ROADS?

40:45.310 --> 40:47.346
I COULD'VE BEEN
THE NEXT WITTGENSTEIN.

40:47.380 --> 40:51.259
I NEVER GOT CARSICK
A DAY IN MY LIFE.

40:51.290 --> 40:52.996
GUS DOESN'T DEAL VERY WELL
WITH SURPRISES.

40:53.030 --> 40:54.224
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, MOM!

40:54.260 --> 40:57.593
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM I WAS THE ONE
WHO RAN OVER HIS DOG, DID YOU?

40:57.640 --> 40:59.938
DAD, NO.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.346
ONE THING AT A TIME.

41:02.380 --> 41:03.916
THANK GOD THAT DOG WAS 17.

41:06.150 --> 41:07.708
CH ECKMATE.
