00:00.681 --> 00:02.081
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.683 --> 00:04.713
So, Leonard, tell
everyone your news.

00:04.714 --> 00:06.915
Oh, uh, I am
starting a book.

00:06.917 --> 00:09.584
That would be big news
from Penny,

00:09.586 --> 00:12.453
but you've read a book before.

00:12.455 --> 00:14.989
He means he's writing a book.

00:14.991 --> 00:18.226
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

00:18.228 --> 00:20.328
Yeah. It's about
a brilliant physicist

00:20.330 --> 00:22.430
who solves crimes
using science.

00:22.432 --> 00:23.498
Oh, Leonard...

00:23.500 --> 00:25.300
It's not about you!

00:26.236 --> 00:28.169
Oh, boy.
What?

00:28.171 --> 00:30.271
They cast the new
Professor Proton.

00:30.273 --> 00:32.974
Is it Sheldon?
Not exactly.

00:32.976 --> 00:34.342
SHELDON:
Wheaton!

00:34.344 --> 00:36.611
It's Wil Wheaton.

00:40.784 --> 00:42.283
Hey, what are you doing?

00:42.285 --> 00:44.085
I thought we were having
dinner at Leonard and Penny's.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.453
Oh, no.

00:45.455 --> 00:47.455
No, they're watching
the new <i>Professor Proton.</i>

00:47.457 --> 00:49.223
I-I can't keep Wil Wheaton
off the Internet,

00:49.225 --> 00:51.025
but I can keep him
off my retinas.

00:51.027 --> 00:54.896
So, you're just gonna sit here
by yourself and do nothing?

00:54.898 --> 00:56.497
Of course not.

00:56.499 --> 01:00.301
I'm going to write mean comments
about Wil's show online.

01:00.303 --> 01:03.404
Well, you can't criticize
something you haven't seen.

01:03.406 --> 01:06.874
I'm sorry, are you familiar
with the Internet?

01:06.876 --> 01:09.077
Well, what if
I watch it with you?

01:09.079 --> 01:11.245
Maybe I won't like it and we
can complain about it together.

01:11.247 --> 01:13.781
Get your own thing
to complain about.

01:13.783 --> 01:16.050
Oh, trust me, I've got one.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.287
Look, at least
if you watch it,

01:19.289 --> 01:22.490
maybe you can find more
specific things to criticize.

01:22.492 --> 01:24.325
Oh, that is a good point.

01:24.327 --> 01:27.161
Criticisms are more hurtful
when they're specific.

(typewriter clacking)

02:25.110 --> 02:26.776
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:26.778 --> 02:28.644
(typewriter dings)
What's that noise?

02:28.646 --> 02:31.114
Oh, it's my new keyboard.
(chuckles)

02:31.116 --> 02:33.249
It looks and sounds like
an old-fashioned typewriter.

02:33.251 --> 02:35.651
It makes me feel
like a real novelist.

02:35.653 --> 02:38.421
You poured yourself a Scotch.
(stutters)

02:38.423 --> 02:39.956
Apple juice.
Oh.

02:40.792 --> 02:41.891
But unsweetened,

02:41.893 --> 02:43.926
like Hemingway used to drink.
Ah.

02:43.928 --> 02:46.162
- So, how's the book coming along?
- Uh, good.

02:46.164 --> 02:48.030
I just wrote the part
where the hero,

02:48.032 --> 02:50.733
hotshot physicist Logan Dean,
arrives at CERN.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.235
Oh, is he based on you?

02:52.237 --> 02:54.804
Uh, kind of.
But he can eat dairy products

02:54.806 --> 02:56.739
without having
to leave the room.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.342
Yeah, that's smart, because
CERN is in Switzerland

02:59.344 --> 03:01.344
and there's a lot of cheese there.
Hmm.

03:01.346 --> 03:04.714
Uh, believe me,
that is a plot point later.

03:04.716 --> 03:06.649
Well, I'm excited to read
it whenever you're ready.

03:06.651 --> 03:08.584
Thank you.

03:08.586 --> 03:11.120
Oh. Oh! I just thought
of the murder weapon!

03:11.122 --> 03:12.655
Swiss army knife?

03:12.657 --> 03:14.624
(laughs) No.

03:16.194 --> 03:17.760
(laughs)

03:17.762 --> 03:20.129
That's way better.

03:21.199 --> 03:23.866
Look, it works!
We did it!

03:23.868 --> 03:27.003
See, there was a reason
to keep that TurboTax CD.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.738
Yeah.

03:28.740 --> 03:30.006
A CD-ROM?

03:30.008 --> 03:32.008
More like "CD-vroom."

03:32.010 --> 03:35.044
Do you feel bad
you told Wil Wheaton

03:35.046 --> 03:37.280
that you'd be his enemy
if he did this show?

03:37.282 --> 03:39.749
No. I feel bad

03:39.751 --> 03:42.051
I'm engaged to somebody
that would point that out.

03:42.053 --> 03:44.921
WHEATON:
It's time for Professor Proton's

03:44.923 --> 03:46.389
science joke of the day.

03:46.391 --> 03:49.025
Why can you not trust atoms?

03:49.027 --> 03:50.793
Hmm.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.796
Because they make up everything.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.999
(laughs):
Oh, that's funny!

03:57.001 --> 04:00.002
Yeah, because they do.
They make up everything.

04:00.004 --> 04:01.704
(doorbell rings)

04:01.706 --> 04:03.973
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

04:03.975 --> 04:06.142
Just when I thought this
couldn't get any better,

04:06.144 --> 04:08.477
Wil has introduced
suspense into the show.

04:10.248 --> 04:13.816
Hey, it's real NASA
astronaut, Howard Wolowitz!

04:13.818 --> 04:16.319
What?!

04:16.321 --> 04:17.753
Hey, Professor Proton.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.120
Hey, thanks
for being here.

04:19.123 --> 04:22.425
No problem.
I'm on my "launch" break.

04:24.596 --> 04:28.030
How could Wil ask Howard to
be on his show and not me?

04:28.032 --> 04:30.032
Well, he is an astronaut.

04:30.034 --> 04:33.402
And he didn't start an online
petition to get Wil fired.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.938
But why wouldn't
Howard tell me?

04:35.940 --> 04:37.406
Well, because
he probably worried

04:37.408 --> 04:40.743
that you'd be
a big baby about it.

04:40.745 --> 04:42.945
All those answers
make a lot of sense.

04:42.947 --> 04:45.948
Thank you, Amy.
That helps.

04:47.051 --> 04:49.118
And then, when the lights
come back on

04:49.120 --> 04:52.154
in the supercollider room,
Dr. Logan Dean makes

04:52.156 --> 04:55.625
two important discoveries:
a gluino

04:55.627 --> 04:57.760
(gruffly):
and murder.

04:57.762 --> 05:00.062
Oh, gluino.
That's exciting.

05:00.832 --> 05:03.599
(gruffly):
And murder.

05:03.601 --> 05:06.102
(gruffly):
I heard you.

05:06.104 --> 05:09.405
The first time.

05:09.407 --> 05:11.774
I don't know which Hemsworth
is playing Logan Dean,

05:11.776 --> 05:13.376
but I know it's a Hemsworth.

05:13.378 --> 05:15.244
Well, Logan's
actually based on me.

05:15.246 --> 05:18.047
So a young Paul Giamatti.

05:18.049 --> 05:19.815
Well, I have to
finish writing it

05:19.817 --> 05:21.651
before they can make it
into a movie,

05:21.653 --> 05:23.853
and I still have a few things
to figure out.

05:23.855 --> 05:25.221
You should talk
to Bernadette.

05:25.223 --> 05:27.123
Since she's been on
bed rest, she's binged,

05:27.125 --> 05:30.326
like, every detective
show in the world.

05:30.328 --> 05:33.129
Oh, there was a funny detective
show in India called <i>Karamchand.</i>

05:33.131 --> 05:34.997
He had an assistant
named Kitty,

05:34.999 --> 05:37.366
and he was always saying,
"Shut up, Kitty!"

05:39.003 --> 05:41.103
Sounds less mean if
you say it in Hindi

05:41.105 --> 05:44.740
and don't think of women
as having feelings.

05:44.742 --> 05:45.975
Hello.

05:45.977 --> 05:47.610
- Hey. - Hey.
- Hi.

05:47.612 --> 05:50.780
Howard, I want you to know
that I forgive you.

05:50.782 --> 05:52.782
I'll take it.

05:52.784 --> 05:54.717
What's he forgiving you for?

05:54.719 --> 05:57.353
Don't care. Clean slate.
Happy Yom Kippur to me.

05:57.355 --> 05:59.955
I know that you were
on Wil's show,

05:59.957 --> 06:01.924
and I know
why you didn't tell me.

06:01.926 --> 06:02.925
Do you?

06:02.927 --> 06:04.593
Because you were afraid

06:04.595 --> 06:06.295
that I would be difficult
and annoying about it.

06:06.297 --> 06:08.297
(chuckles)
I hope your book has a twist

06:08.299 --> 06:10.666
as surprising as that.

06:10.668 --> 06:13.235
It doesn't.

06:13.237 --> 06:15.604
I thought you were
boycotting Wil's show.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.873
I was, but I decided
to give it a shot,

06:17.875 --> 06:19.775
and I actually enjoyed it.

06:19.777 --> 06:23.212
Just out of curiosity, how did
you come to be on the show?

06:23.214 --> 06:25.214
Did he ask you?
Did you ask him?

06:25.216 --> 06:28.150
Did you just show up on the set
and ring that doorbell?

06:28.152 --> 06:30.319
Sheldon, if you want
to be on the show,

06:30.321 --> 06:32.822
you're gonna have to
apologize to Wil.

06:32.824 --> 06:36.192
That would be
the mature thing to do.

06:36.194 --> 06:39.195
Let's put a pin in that
and keep thinking.

06:43.101 --> 06:44.667
Ooh.

06:44.669 --> 06:46.736
What? What? Which part?

06:46.738 --> 06:48.371
That was just the baby kicking.

06:48.373 --> 06:50.039
Got it. (chuckles)

06:50.041 --> 06:52.808
- But this is good so far, really good.
- Yeah?

06:52.810 --> 06:55.311
Yeah. I have no idea
who the killer is.

06:55.313 --> 06:57.279
Oh, great. Me, neither.

06:57.281 --> 07:01.350
So, does Penny know
you based a character on her?

07:01.352 --> 07:03.285
What character?

07:03.287 --> 07:06.122
Ilsa, the head of the institute.
That's clearly Penny.

07:06.124 --> 07:07.156
No, it's not.

07:07.158 --> 07:08.357
Really?

07:08.359 --> 07:09.959
Confident, ball-busting beauty

07:09.961 --> 07:12.695
who's always
rolling her eyes at Logan?

07:12.697 --> 07:17.233
Trust me, that describes
more women than you think.

07:17.235 --> 07:21.203
"He looked at the stunning woman
who was his boss and said..."

07:21.205 --> 07:23.706
It's murder.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.509
Figure that out yourself,
genius?

07:27.945 --> 07:29.845
Okay, no need to be snarky.

07:29.847 --> 07:31.080
Who would want to kill him?

07:31.082 --> 07:33.916
Could be anyone.
Dr. Silvers.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.420
Dr. Prekash.

07:38.956 --> 07:41.257
Hans the janitor.

07:43.361 --> 07:45.294
But the door is locked,

07:45.296 --> 07:47.430
so it has to be someone
in this room.

07:47.432 --> 07:50.433
Wow, you are on fire.

07:52.603 --> 07:55.237
Maybe it is a
little like Penny.

07:55.239 --> 07:57.139
Any chance she'll be flattered?

07:57.141 --> 07:59.341
I don't know. She's pretty mean.

07:59.343 --> 08:00.843
Ilsa or Penny?

08:00.845 --> 08:03.245
Exactly.

08:05.983 --> 08:08.284
Oh, hey, Howard.
What's up?

08:08.286 --> 08:10.085
I'm so sorry.

08:10.087 --> 08:11.554
What for?

08:13.391 --> 08:15.157
Hello.

08:15.159 --> 08:16.692
Hello, Sheldon.

08:16.694 --> 08:18.727
I suppose you've come here
to tell me

08:18.729 --> 08:21.063
that you've moved me to your
super secret enemies list.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.333
I don't have
a super secret enemies list.

08:24.335 --> 08:26.235
I'm not a Bond villain.

08:27.305 --> 08:28.838
I'm just a regular guy,

08:28.840 --> 08:31.140
with a regular enemies list.

08:31.142 --> 08:34.376
Which, by the way,
you are no longer on.

08:34.378 --> 08:37.446
Really?
Well, that is something.

08:37.448 --> 08:40.716
It's not something that I care
about, but it is something.

08:40.717 --> 08:42.650
He's trying to
say he's sorry.

08:42.653 --> 08:44.153
I am.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.323
I watched your show,
and it's really good.

08:47.325 --> 08:48.657
Aw, thank you.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.826
And I regret
how hard I was on you.

08:50.828 --> 08:52.127
I want you to know

08:52.129 --> 08:54.396
that being on
the <i>Professor Proton</i> show

08:54.398 --> 08:56.632
has been a childhood dream
of mine.

08:56.634 --> 08:58.300
So, if you're
ever looking

08:58.302 --> 09:02.304
for any more scientist guests,
I hope you'll consider me.

09:02.306 --> 09:05.774
I appreciate that, Sheldon,
and I'll keep it in mind.

09:05.776 --> 09:07.209
You know, actually...

09:07.211 --> 09:09.645
Yay!
Uh...

09:09.647 --> 09:12.181
No. No. I want to have

09:12.183 --> 09:14.750
more female scientists
represented on the show,

09:14.752 --> 09:17.853
and I thought maybe Amy
might be interested?

09:19.000 --> 09:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:27.331 --> 09:29.331
(stutters) Or...

09:29.333 --> 09:31.901
wouldn't it be nice

09:31.903 --> 09:35.738
to have us both on, to show that

09:35.740 --> 09:39.475
even female scientists
can land a man?

09:41.279 --> 09:42.778
(sighs)

09:42.780 --> 09:44.580
I said "sorry."

09:49.501 --> 09:51.721
So, what do you think?

09:51.723 --> 09:54.283
I like it. I can't wait
to see who the killer is.

09:54.284 --> 09:57.360
Is it that Ilsa girl?
She seems pretty mean.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.818
But adorably mean,

10:00.820 --> 10:03.821
like a baby lion?

10:03.823 --> 10:06.724
No, regular mean,
like a regular lion.

10:08.361 --> 10:10.928
But it seems pretty accurate,
considering who you based it on.

10:10.930 --> 10:12.997
Huh.

10:12.999 --> 10:15.332
And who do you think that is?

10:16.435 --> 10:17.735
But the door is locked,

10:17.737 --> 10:19.970
so it has to be someone
in this room.

10:23.142 --> 10:25.743
Wow. You are on fire.

10:27.913 --> 10:29.513
Oh. Y...

10:29.515 --> 10:31.615
Bernadette.
Yeah, sure.

10:31.617 --> 10:34.118
Each one of you had a motive.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.787
Who died and
made you detective?

10:36.789 --> 10:38.989
He did.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.626
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

10:42.628 --> 10:45.029
a massive inferiority complex.

10:45.031 --> 10:47.164
It's not massive.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.266
It's just average-sized.

10:51.904 --> 10:53.971
I don't mean to interrupt,
but somebody's tracking

10:53.973 --> 10:57.541
blood everywhere, so--
never mind, it's me.

10:58.411 --> 11:00.577
You say we're all suspects.

11:00.579 --> 11:03.380
How do we know
you're not the killer?

11:03.382 --> 11:04.915
I have an alibi.

11:04.917 --> 11:08.819
Yeah. He's not smart enough to
pull off a murder like this.

11:10.456 --> 11:14.024
It's pretty obvious:
blonde, mean, glasses.

11:14.026 --> 11:15.959
It doesn't say "glasses."
Oh, really?

11:15.961 --> 11:18.462
(stammers) But it will,
because Ilsa does.

11:18.464 --> 11:20.397
And you know
who else wears them?

11:20.399 --> 11:22.833
(clicks tongue)
Bernadette.

11:23.869 --> 11:25.602
And-and that's her, cause it's,

11:25.604 --> 11:27.905
it's totally, it's totally her.

11:31.110 --> 11:33.644
Oh, Amy.
Good, you're here.

11:33.646 --> 11:34.845
Hi. What's up?

11:34.847 --> 11:38.682
How would you like to be
on television?

11:38.684 --> 11:40.617
Is it gonna be a news story

11:40.619 --> 11:43.520
where I have to say you were
quiet and kept to yourself

11:43.522 --> 11:45.422
and I'm as shocked as anyone?

11:45.424 --> 11:47.825
No, it's not.

11:47.827 --> 11:51.862
Wil Wheaton wants you to be
on <i>Professor Proton.</i>

11:51.864 --> 11:54.998
That's nice, but I'm not
really interested.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.967
What do you mean?

11:56.969 --> 11:59.369
But he wants to talk
about women in science.

11:59.371 --> 12:02.639
You're a woman, you're in
science. You go, girl.

12:02.641 --> 12:04.842
I'm all for promoting women
in science,

12:04.844 --> 12:07.311
but I don't really want to be
on Wil's show.

12:07.313 --> 12:11.115
Is it because
kids may be there,

12:11.117 --> 12:13.917
and they're known carriers
of head lice? I get that.

12:13.919 --> 12:16.520
Sure, that's the reason.

12:16.522 --> 12:18.822
Wait a minute.

12:18.824 --> 12:21.058
You're always bragging that lice
aren't attracted to you

12:21.060 --> 12:22.760
because your scalp is so oily.

12:22.762 --> 12:24.828
That was on your dating profile.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.997
Okay, look,

12:26.999 --> 12:29.600
I know you have strong feelings
about <i>Professor Proton,</i>

12:29.602 --> 12:32.069
and I don't want to get
in the middle of that.

12:32.071 --> 12:35.405
So you're not
going to do something

12:35.407 --> 12:37.441
just because you think
it might upset me?

12:37.443 --> 12:39.376
Well, it's tricky,

12:39.378 --> 12:41.512
because answering that
question honestly

12:41.514 --> 12:44.915
is one of the things I tend
not to do because it upsets you.

12:44.917 --> 12:48.752
Well, that's
very upsetting.

12:48.754 --> 12:50.654
Like I said.

12:52.491 --> 12:54.057
What other things
don't you do because of me?

12:54.059 --> 12:56.693
Remember last week
when we went

12:56.695 --> 12:59.496
to that dueling piano bar
I was so excited about?

12:59.498 --> 13:00.136
No.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.101
Well, now you're
getting it.

13:05.137 --> 13:08.105
Boy, I don't know how people
who aren't on bed rest

13:08.107 --> 13:10.674
keep up with
the Kardashians.

13:10.676 --> 13:12.709
Well, sometimes
you have to read in your car

13:12.711 --> 13:15.779
while your husband thinks
you're working late.

13:15.781 --> 13:18.782
Speaking of which, he came by
yesterday to show me his book.

13:18.784 --> 13:22.586
Oh, and-and
what did you think?

13:22.588 --> 13:23.854
I liked it.

13:23.856 --> 13:26.590
Really? The Ilsa character
didn't bother you?

13:26.592 --> 13:29.159
Oh, he was exaggerating.
You're not really like that.

13:30.963 --> 13:33.530
Well, I know
<i>I'm</i> not like that.

13:33.532 --> 13:35.632
The character
was based on you.

13:35.634 --> 13:37.401
I don't know
what to tell you.

13:37.403 --> 13:39.503
When I brought it up with
Leonard, he said it was you.

13:39.505 --> 13:42.372
Well, when I
brought it up, he...

13:42.374 --> 13:44.074
got all squirrelly
and left the room.

13:44.076 --> 13:46.243
Son of a bitch.

13:49.582 --> 13:52.749
I just learned
some very distressing news.

13:52.751 --> 13:55.452
Sometimes,
Amy doesn't do things

13:55.454 --> 13:57.054
because she's worried about
how I'll react.

13:57.056 --> 13:59.756
First of all, it's not
sometimes, it's always.

13:59.758 --> 14:03.193
Second, it's not
Amy, it's everybody.

14:04.964 --> 14:07.297
And third, it's not news,
it's well-established.

14:07.299 --> 14:09.967
Yeah. Like just now I
wanted to get a croissant,

14:09.969 --> 14:13.704
but I didn't want to hear
you say, "Ooh, la, la."

14:13.706 --> 14:16.006
So you're saying
everyone walks on eggshells

14:16.008 --> 14:17.708
to spare my feelings?

14:17.710 --> 14:19.543
No, of course not,
because we don't want

14:19.545 --> 14:21.745
to hear you complain about
how much you hate the sound

14:21.747 --> 14:24.414
of crunching eggshells.

14:24.416 --> 14:27.718
I don't want my relationship
with Amy to be like that.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.354
Sheldon, Amy knew
what she was getting into.

14:30.356 --> 14:31.488
You think?

14:31.490 --> 14:33.290
Yes, we warned her.

14:34.894 --> 14:37.294
Well, regardless, I can change.

14:37.296 --> 14:39.396
(both laugh) Sure.
Yeah, of course you can.

14:39.398 --> 14:42.566
You know, everybody thinks
I'm so predictable.

14:42.568 --> 14:44.468
Well, tomorrow I'm gonna
show up at work

14:44.470 --> 14:46.470
and do something
no one will expect.

14:46.472 --> 14:48.705
Where a baseball cap backwards
to prove your point?

14:53.712 --> 14:56.747
Yes, but which hat?

14:56.749 --> 14:59.349
Gryffindor.

14:59.351 --> 15:02.352
Well, now that you guessed it,
I'm not gonna do it.

15:02.354 --> 15:03.587
Yeah, you will.

15:03.589 --> 15:06.590
Yeah.

15:11.463 --> 15:13.630
(scoffs)

15:16.468 --> 15:19.102
Looks like the bullet
went right through you.

15:19.104 --> 15:20.904
Damn it, Logan.
When are you gonna stop?

15:20.906 --> 15:24.741
Sorry. I didn't get my PhD
in quitting.

15:24.743 --> 15:28.378
You're a physicist. What makes
you think you can solve a crime?

15:28.380 --> 15:30.047
He's losing
a lot of blood.

15:30.049 --> 15:32.950
Great. I'm gonna
have to clean that up.

15:34.053 --> 15:35.886
You know what?
A little soda water

15:35.888 --> 15:38.855
might get that
right out.

15:38.857 --> 15:41.191
We got to find some bandages.
ILSA: No.

15:41.193 --> 15:43.193
There's no time.

15:45.631 --> 15:47.397
Does it hurt?

15:47.399 --> 15:50.934
Everything you do hurts.

15:52.338 --> 15:55.605
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

15:58.711 --> 16:00.410
(door opens)

16:00.412 --> 16:01.511
Hey.

16:01.513 --> 16:03.413
So this is what you think of me?

16:03.415 --> 16:05.816
Huh? I'm mean and
everything I do hurts you?

16:05.818 --> 16:07.617
What are you talking about?

16:07.619 --> 16:08.952
I know I'm Ilsa.

16:08.954 --> 16:11.321
Wha...? That is crazy.

16:11.323 --> 16:13.090
You-you two are
totally different.

16:13.092 --> 16:14.057
How?

16:14.059 --> 16:16.693
Well, you... She...

16:17.563 --> 16:19.529
Her name's Ilsa.

16:19.531 --> 16:21.098
You know what?

16:21.100 --> 16:23.000
It's fine. Write
whatever you want.

16:23.002 --> 16:25.802
And by the way, Logan Dean can
tell everyone he's five-eight,

16:25.804 --> 16:27.971
but he's not fooling anybody!

16:37.383 --> 16:40.550
Are you sure that's the move
you want to make?

16:40.552 --> 16:41.818
Absolutely.

16:41.820 --> 16:44.254
Okay.

16:46.425 --> 16:48.759
Checkmate.

16:48.761 --> 16:50.961
Oh, I did not see that coming.

16:52.097 --> 16:54.431
That's well played, Amy.

16:54.433 --> 16:55.899
What's going on?

16:55.901 --> 17:00.670
You beat me, and I am responding
with humility and admiration.

17:00.672 --> 17:02.372
What does it look like?

17:02.374 --> 17:04.775
You let me win
so you could show me

17:04.777 --> 17:06.977
how emotionally mature you are,
didn't you?

17:06.979 --> 17:09.346
Well, I couldn't wait for you
to actually beat me;

17:09.348 --> 17:10.579
that would take forever.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.950
I'm sorry. It's...

17:13.952 --> 17:15.519
I'm trying to show you

17:15.521 --> 17:17.319
that I can change.

17:17.321 --> 17:19.990
I-I don't want you to miss out
on things because of me.

17:19.992 --> 17:22.358
I know you don't.

17:22.361 --> 17:24.560
You know,
and maybe somewhere out there,

17:24.563 --> 17:27.964
there is a little girl
who will see you on Wil's show

17:27.965 --> 17:30.467
and realize that she, too,
can grow up

17:30.469 --> 17:32.536
to be a brilliant, amazing,

17:32.538 --> 17:34.738
successful scientist.

17:36.475 --> 17:38.008
Thank you.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.110
Who is really terrible at chess.

17:40.112 --> 17:41.945
Got it.

17:41.947 --> 17:43.980
No, no, no.
I mean really bad.

17:43.982 --> 17:47.951
What was your queen doing
over there, going shopping?

17:50.522 --> 17:52.989
I mean, I-I didn't intend
to write about Penny,

17:52.991 --> 17:55.592
but I guess maybe
subconsciously I did.

17:55.594 --> 17:59.496
I believe you mean
"unconsciously," dear.

17:59.498 --> 18:01.798
Yeah, sure.
You know, it would be nice

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
if you didn't correct me
all the time.

18:03.802 --> 18:06.236
It would be nice
if I didn't have to.

18:07.673 --> 18:10.307
Maybe this book of yours
is a bad idea.

18:10.309 --> 18:11.508
What do you mean?

18:11.510 --> 18:12.776
Well, you're a physicist.

18:12.778 --> 18:15.045
What makes you think
you can write a book?

18:19.685 --> 18:21.751
You're a physicist.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.821
What makes you think
you can solve a crime?

18:26.425 --> 18:28.391
Got to go.

18:28.393 --> 18:29.793
I think you mean "have..."

18:32.431 --> 18:33.430
Oh, Penny, good news.

18:33.432 --> 18:34.931
It's not you.
What?

18:34.933 --> 18:36.700
Ilsa. It's not you.
It's my mother.

18:36.702 --> 18:38.635
I've been writing
about my mother!

18:39.671 --> 18:41.872
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

18:41.874 --> 18:44.374
a massive inferiority complex.

18:44.376 --> 18:46.510
It's not massive.

18:46.512 --> 18:48.879
It's just average-sized.

18:52.117 --> 18:54.417
We got to find
some bandages.

18:54.419 --> 18:56.653
There's no time.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.491
Does it hurt?

19:01.493 --> 19:03.927
Everything you do hurts.

19:03.929 --> 19:06.930
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

19:06.932 --> 19:08.698
Maybe you like it.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.902
I-- M-Maybe I do.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.796
WHEATON: Well, that is
our show for today.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.665
And I want to say
a very special thank you

19:28.667 --> 19:30.366
to Dr. Amy Fowler
for being here.

19:30.368 --> 19:31.801
It was a real pleasure
having you.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.903
And you can feel
that pleasure

19:33.905 --> 19:38.875
because you don't have a lesion
in your nucleus accumbens.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.744
I really hope I don't.

19:41.746 --> 19:43.346
All right,
we'll see you next time!

19:43.348 --> 19:45.081
<i>(Professor Proton</i>
theme music plays)

19:45.083 --> 19:47.517
Amy.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.752
You were glowing.

19:49.754 --> 19:51.754
(giggles)

19:51.756 --> 19:53.823
Oily scalp.

19:54.993 --> 19:56.693
I'm so proud of you.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.696
And I'm proud of you.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.831
Because you can't
tell how jealous I am?

20:01.833 --> 20:04.834
No, no, no. I can.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.837
But I can tell how hard
you're trying to keep it in.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.006
Really hard.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.506
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:13.530 --> 20:14.545
All right, I'm gonna
go scream on the roof.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.579
- Love you.
- Love you.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.825

21:03.194 --> 21:06.329
A simile directly compares
two things,

21:06.331 --> 21:09.198
using the words “like” and “as”"

21:09.200 --> 21:11.267
“I slept

21:11.269 --> 21:13.436
“I'm hungry as a horse”"

21:13.438 --> 21:15.972
“Your love is like
bad medicine.”

21:15.974 --> 21:17.106
Exactly.

21:17.108 --> 21:18.108
That's Bon Jovi.
