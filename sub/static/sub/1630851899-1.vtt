WEBVTT

01:32.092 --> 01:34.928
I can't remember if I cried

01:35.804 --> 01:40.642
When I read about his widowed bride

01:41.810 --> 01:45.022
And something touched me deep inside

01:45.772 --> 01:48.483
The day the music...

01:53.155 --> 01:55.157
UV radiation high.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.452
Temperature, 150 degrees. Caution.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.582
Body temperature high, 101.2.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.502
Okay. Okay.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.717
Dewey.

02:15.052 --> 02:19.848
SoBye, bye, bye Miss American Pie

02:20.390 --> 02:23.143
Drove my Chevy to the levee

02:23.227 --> 02:25.854
But the levee was dry

02:26.897 --> 02:31.693
And them good ole boysWere drinking whiskey and rye

02:32.236 --> 02:35.489
Singin' this'll be the day that I die

02:37.950 --> 02:40.577
This'll be the day that I die

02:45.040 --> 02:47.042
Dewey, bottle.

02:51.672 --> 02:57.427
Did you write the book of loveAnd do you have faith in God above

02:58.679 --> 03:02.766
If the Bible tells you so? If the Bible tells you so?

03:04.142 --> 03:08.814
Hey, do you believe in rock and roll?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.233
Can music--

03:13.110 --> 03:15.320
Save your mortal soul?

03:15.404 --> 03:18.782
And can you teach me to dance...

03:26.915 --> 03:27.916
Okay.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.210
Someone's going to be happy tonight.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.059
Jesus.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.229
Getting old.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.489
I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck

04:01.033 --> 04:03.952
With a pink carnationAnd a pickup truck

04:06.163 --> 04:10.709
Knew I was out of luckThe day the music died

04:11.710 --> 04:12.794
All right. Front's up.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.548
Done.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.176

07:42.254 --> 07:43.881
Okay. Your turn.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.426
Get the eyeballs.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.761
Up with the paw.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.598
Eyes up.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.141
Up. Come on.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.265
All right. See you downstairs.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.210
Hey. I didn't forget about you. Hey. I didn't forget about you.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.713
What? Did you miss me? Yes, I missed you.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.634
Yes, I think about you all the time.Yes, I do. Yeah.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.179
Yeah. Yeah.

09:15.138 --> 09:19.726
Yes, I'll give you scratches.That's all I'm here for, right?

09:20.936 --> 09:22.145
Just to scratch you.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.482
Just to scratch you.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.996
Now can we please havea quiet evening at home tonight?

09:42.291 --> 09:43.625
Hey, cut it out.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.007
Good boy, Dewey.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.632
Okay, okay. Don't worry about me.Carry on.

11:49.877 --> 11:50.878
Thanks, Dewey.

12:20.782 --> 12:21.783
Oh, hi.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.415
Where's your ball? Is it here?Is it here? Where's your ball?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.043
Go! Oh! Get it!

12:43.639 --> 12:44.640
All right, you're next.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.059
Come here, dog breath. Come on.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.607
Okay.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.942
Now I'm gonna need your eyes.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.486
I'm sorry, Dewey.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.531
I'll get you new ones. I promise.

14:24.615 --> 14:25.699
And it'll be worth it.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.431
One small step for man...

14:51.934 --> 14:55.187
one giant leap for Finch Weinberg.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.089
Hello.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.844
If you can speak, say "yes."

15:30.889 --> 15:33.267
"This device is not responding or notcompatible with the operating system.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.769
Please call technical supportfor assistance."

15:35.853 --> 15:36.854
Okay.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.856
Hey.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.109
How about nodding your head?

15:44.695 --> 15:47.489
If you can understand me, nod your head.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.582
No, I don't know why he's not working.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.177
You do-- You do understand?Do you understand?

16:11.346 --> 16:16.560
Only nod if I ask you a questionthat you understand.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.644
Do you understand?

16:20.647 --> 16:21.690
Stop nodding.

16:28.989 --> 16:29.948
You understand.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.746
Stop nodding your head.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.961
You have a friend! Good boy.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.425
Yeah.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.722
Okay, I've done some tweaking.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.895
Not exactly what I had in mind.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.439
It should do for now.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.363
Now, if you can speak, say something.

17:20.249 --> 17:21.290
Calm down.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.627
Something.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.550
Something. Something, indeed.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.427
Indeed.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.100
So...

17:39.685 --> 17:41.270
Tell me something interesting.

17:42.187 --> 17:47.985
Giraffes can survive without waterlonger than camels.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.278
Is that a fact?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.905
I bet you didn't know that.

17:53.073 --> 17:57.536
Kangaroo rats can survivelonger than giraffes.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.830
-Okay. Okay, okay.-Did you know--

18:00.873 --> 18:03.709
Tell me something interesting about you.

18:04.251 --> 18:08.714
I have four primary directives.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.424
What is the first directive?

18:10.507 --> 18:15.721
First directive:A robot cannot harm a human

18:15.804 --> 18:19.516
or, through inaction,allow a human to be harmed.

18:20.726 --> 18:21.852
Hey, calm down.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.688
Calm down-- All right, listen to this.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.690
It'll make you feel better.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.736
What about the fourth directive?

18:30.819 --> 18:33.071
Fourth directive:

18:33.155 --> 18:39.161
In Finch's absence,robot must protect the welfare of dog.

18:39.244 --> 18:43.415
This directive supersedesall other directives.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.833
You hear that?

18:44.917 --> 18:48.837
So, you understandhow important this dog is to me?

18:50.047 --> 18:51.048
Yes.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.885
So, you know who Finch is?

18:56.136 --> 18:57.971
You are Finch.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.016
Yes.

19:04.186 --> 19:08.815
Now... define absence.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.820
The state of not being present.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.073
Finch...

19:17.491 --> 19:18.492
Yes?

19:18.575 --> 19:23.747
When will you be absent?

19:31.171 --> 19:32.965
Oh, shit.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.423
Oh, sheet.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.305
Hello, dog.

20:22.514 --> 20:26.768
I know 16,000 interesting facts about--

21:08.101 --> 21:09.561
Hello, Finch.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.398
I'm connecting youto a local weather station.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.691
Tell me when you see it.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.818
Connected.

21:16.902 --> 21:19.404
I need you to use this datato make a forecast.

21:19.905 --> 21:23.033
Data indicates 15 separate weather events

21:23.116 --> 21:27.246
advancing at 155 miles per hour.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.457
Current data predictsthese events will intersect

21:30.541 --> 21:34.211
over this locationwithin the next 24 hours.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.462
How long will it last?

21:35.546 --> 21:42.302
Probability these combined eventswill create a superstorm is 1.00452--

21:42.386 --> 21:45.848
No. No, I need to knowhow long it will last.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.435
Forty days, approximately.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.557
So we need to getthe hell out of St. Louis.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.726
South is out of the question.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.021
Not with the storm season we've had.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.190
As is north, obviously.

22:37.608 --> 22:40.986
And east, too many cities.

22:41.737 --> 22:43.030
You know what that means?

22:44.489 --> 22:45.490
People.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.701
Pass.

22:49.828 --> 22:52.331
So that's that, then.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.250
Head west.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.503
Over the mountains.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.756
Go easy on the rations. Go easy on the rations.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.093
A little bit of luck.

23:05.928 --> 23:08.388
Find placesthat haven't been ransacked or looted.

23:13.602 --> 23:15.103
San Francisco.

23:16.939 --> 23:17.940
What do you think?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.025
Yeah, I think it's time.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.215
What are you doing, Finch?

23:43.298 --> 23:46.718
I'm increasing your transfer rate.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.472
It's not what I want,but we're out of time.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.474
Can you simplify?

23:52.558 --> 23:58.021
If we don't go before that storm hits,we'll die down here. All of us.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.314
Do you understand?

23:59.898 --> 24:00.899
Yes. Yes.

24:00.983 --> 24:03.068
So, as soon as you can walk,we're leaving.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.486
But, Finch...

24:05.445 --> 24:10.117
if we leave now,data transfer would only be at 72%.

24:10.951 --> 24:12.786
Well, we can't all be Einstein.

24:12.870 --> 24:17.833
Did you know Albert Einsteinwas born with an abnormally large head?

24:29.178 --> 24:31.388
I gave you digital levelers.

24:32.681 --> 24:37.936
And redundant gyros, so...it's not your balance.

24:40.397 --> 24:41.732
It's your rhythm.

24:46.069 --> 24:49.948
Watch me and imitate. Walking in place.

24:51.283 --> 24:56.455
One, two. One, two. One, two.

24:56.955 --> 25:01.710
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

25:01.793 --> 25:05.255
-Good. Good. Stop. Stop.-One, two. One, two.

25:05.339 --> 25:11.345
All right. All right.Now, this is walking forward...

25:11.970 --> 25:16.767
One, two. One, two. One, two.

25:16.850 --> 25:20.562
Turning... and one, two.

25:20.646 --> 25:23.524
One, two. One, two.

25:26.151 --> 25:27.152
Understood?

25:28.529 --> 25:29.530
Okay.

25:32.324 --> 25:33.325
All right.

25:36.328 --> 25:38.872
And imitate. Forward.

25:42.918 --> 25:44.962
One, two.

25:51.301 --> 25:52.761
Walking.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.138
Yeah. Good.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.223
And stop.

25:56.849 --> 25:57.850
Turning.

25:57.933 --> 25:58.976
Turning.

26:05.399 --> 26:06.400
Stop.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.569
Stopping.

26:09.236 --> 26:11.446
That's good. Good.

26:14.575 --> 26:15.909
No, here. Hey.

26:17.411 --> 26:18.412
Look.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.706
Walk to me.

26:27.212 --> 26:30.799
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.342
One, Finch.

26:34.219 --> 26:36.263
-One, two.-Now, that's falling.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.347
One, two.

26:50.694 --> 26:51.820
One, two.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.323
One, two. One.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.918
I am walking.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.256
Dewey?

27:16.720 --> 27:17.721
Dewey.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.808
Dewey.

28:00.681 --> 28:02.015
I am okay.

28:06.478 --> 28:07.729
Sorry.

28:13.151 --> 28:17.906
This is a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.951
UV radiation high. Caution.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.536
Hello, dog.

28:22.619 --> 28:25.372
Temperature, 147 degrees.

28:25.455 --> 28:31.503
I know 3,027 interesting factsabout this vehicle.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.340
Would you like me to drive?

28:35.424 --> 28:37.384
No, you just learned how to walk.

28:38.093 --> 28:41.180
Wait, wait. Let me sit down.

29:27.434 --> 29:33.524
Did you know the population of St. Louisis over 600,000?

29:33.607 --> 29:35.567
Where is everybody?

29:36.318 --> 29:37.819
It's a long story.

29:38.529 --> 29:41.698
Yeah, we should be safeonce we get into the mountains.

29:41.782 --> 29:45.202
Finch, what is our destination?

29:55.671 --> 29:59.341
When I was a kid, these fieldswere covered with wildflowers.

29:59.424 --> 30:04.721
Mustard seed, alfalfa.Color as far as the eye could see. Mustard seed, alfalfa.Color as far as the eye could see.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.433
And in summertime, there were bees.

30:10.561 --> 30:11.645
You would've loved it.

30:13.522 --> 30:17.526
Finch, there is somethinghanging out the back of my head.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.195
I know. Don't fiddle with it.

30:20.279 --> 30:21.572
Sorry.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.407
And stop apologizing.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.783
Sorry.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.744
As soon as it's safe to stop,I'll take a look.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.664
Woof, woof.

30:40.591 --> 30:44.845
UV radiation high. 165 degrees.

30:44.928 --> 30:45.929
Caution.

30:47.014 --> 30:49.433
-Hold still.-Sorry.

30:51.018 --> 30:54.521
Are these all photographsof places you have been?

30:55.564 --> 30:56.857
Those are postcards.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.943
For the record, it's rude to riflethrough a man's personal effects.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.029
Postcards.

31:03.280 --> 31:08.285
Like a card sent in the post?

31:08.368 --> 31:11.371
Yes. Yes, people actually used to do that.

31:12.331 --> 31:15.459
Before this thing they call the Internet.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.085
Why?

31:19.087 --> 31:21.673
So friends and family could stay in touch.

31:24.092 --> 31:25.886
Who sent that one?

31:29.097 --> 31:30.724
-Oops.-What was that?

31:30.807 --> 31:33.143
Nothing. Nothing. Just stop fidgeting.

31:33.227 --> 31:34.228
Sorry.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.648
Who sent you that one?

31:41.235 --> 31:42.819
An uncle in San Francisco.

31:43.445 --> 31:45.197
And this one?

31:46.615 --> 31:48.242
Well, that's the Tower Bridge in London.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.661
And that'sthe Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.538
And that's Sydney Harbour Bridge.

31:52.621 --> 31:54.581
Sydney Harbour?

31:55.415 --> 31:58.335
I would like to see this bridge very much.

31:58.418 --> 32:01.839
Maybe we shouldmake this our destination, Finch. Maybe we shouldmake this our destination, Finch.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.632
Well, Sydney's pretty far away.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.678
Why not something a little closer,like San Francisco?

32:07.761 --> 32:09.012
How far away is that?

32:09.096 --> 32:13.350
1,811 miles exactly.

32:19.606 --> 32:21.024
Maybe we'll see it together.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.527
There. All done.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.696
Good as new.

32:25.779 --> 32:29.283
Well, we have got toget this show on the road.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.701
You have a lot to learn.

32:31.535 --> 32:35.372
No, Dewey.Let's let the big fella have a turn.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.794
Watch me then imitate.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.212
Now, lesson number one...

32:42.296 --> 32:43.630
Lesson number one.

32:43.714 --> 32:46.967
Never pass on the opportunityfor your next meal.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.094
Especially when you havea hungry dog to feed.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.805
Especially when you havea hungry dog to feed.

32:51.889 --> 32:53.599
Like that theater there.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.852
You see, the padlocks on the doorsare still intact.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.270
They are still intact.

32:58.353 --> 33:00.939
That means whatever was insideis still inside. That means whatever was insideis still inside.

33:01.023 --> 33:02.608
UV radiation high.

33:02.691 --> 33:04.193
-And lesson number two...-Caution.

33:04.276 --> 33:07.821
Up there, there are holes in the sky.It's like Swiss cheese.

33:07.905 --> 33:13.452
-Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.-Took me awhile to figure that out.

33:13.535 --> 33:15.996
When the flare hit,it completely fried the ozone,

33:16.079 --> 33:19.791
and then the EMP took outeverything electrical just like that.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.752
It was a good thing I was at work.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.671
What are you doing?

33:25.464 --> 33:27.508
I was locating the cheese.

33:29.384 --> 33:30.385
Come here.

33:30.469 --> 33:34.097
But, Finch,you said up there it's like Swiss cheese.

33:34.181 --> 33:37.184
-I was locating the cheese.-Hey, this is not a joke.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.561
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.

33:39.645 --> 33:43.815
This is not a joke.I don't wear this UV suit for fun.

33:43.899 --> 33:45.234
Why are you imitating me?

33:45.317 --> 33:47.694
You said watch then imitate.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.905
-Stop imitating me.-Sorry.

33:49.988 --> 33:51.406
And stop apologizing.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.699
Stopping.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.828
Lesson number three is:

33:56.912 --> 34:00.707
Never willfully destroysomebody else's property. Never willfully destroysomebody else's property.

34:05.838 --> 34:08.047
A little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.262
Help me open this door.

34:21.895 --> 34:22.896
Muscle.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.315
That was a little too much muscle.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.569
Can you simplify?

34:28.652 --> 34:30.237
That's a figure of speech.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.574
It's another way of saying something,like the cheese.

34:33.657 --> 34:34.992
Like the cheese.

34:35.074 --> 34:38.286
Yeah, like the cheese. Except not exactly.

34:38.786 --> 34:42.456
Finch, this is a playby William Shakespeare.

34:42.541 --> 34:45.210
A dramatic comedy about love,

34:45.293 --> 34:50.340
deception, and other human misunders--

34:50.424 --> 34:52.342
Never really cared for the theater.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.148
Lesson number four:

35:07.858 --> 35:09.151
Use your initiative.

35:11.653 --> 35:15.449
-Finch, do you think this is safe to eat?-Hold this.

35:15.532 --> 35:18.160
-It is approximately 15 years old.-Just like that.

35:18.243 --> 35:21.205
Now why do you thinkthey called it popcorn, huh?

35:25.459 --> 35:28.212
Lesson number five: Live a little.

35:28.295 --> 35:29.296
Go ahead.

35:30.547 --> 35:31.548
Yeah.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.055
Again.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.767
Again, again!

35:45.395 --> 35:47.105
Again, again!

35:50.192 --> 35:53.362
Tornado detection. Shelter advised.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.844
Air pressure--

36:17.302 --> 36:21.473
Damn it. I thought it would break upbefore it reached this altitude.

36:21.557 --> 36:24.977
Body temperature high, 102.2.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.228
Air pressure drop.

36:26.311 --> 36:31.066
Finch, there is something rattling aroundinside of my head.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.359
Shelter advised.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.946
-Tornado warning. Shelter advised.-Stay. Stay, boy.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.573
Stay. Good dog.

36:37.656 --> 36:39.575
Tornado warning. Shelter advised.

36:39.658 --> 36:40.492
Follow me.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.744
Stay, boy. Stay.

36:45.831 --> 36:50.752
We need to tie the RV downwith these spikes and the winches.

36:51.378 --> 36:53.881
You see what I'm doing?

36:55.257 --> 36:57.926
You need to imitate me exactly.Understand?

36:58.010 --> 36:59.052
Understand.

36:59.136 --> 37:00.512
1,800 feet. 1,800 feet.

37:00.596 --> 37:02.139
Shelter advised.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.934
-Make sure there is no slack on the cable.-No slack.

37:06.018 --> 37:07.477
1,700 feet.

37:08.937 --> 37:10.355
Tornado warning.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.109
Shelter advised.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.906
All right, the next one.Give me the next one.

37:24.036 --> 37:27.206
-Tornado warning. 1,400 feet.-I still can't see anything.

37:34.254 --> 37:37.049
-Come on. Oh, my God. Come on.-Caution. Heart rate high.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.384
You can do this.

37:41.512 --> 37:44.306
You should returnto the recreational vehicle.

37:44.389 --> 37:45.474
1,200 feet.

37:56.026 --> 37:57.277
900 feet.

37:57.361 --> 37:58.403
Hey.

38:00.489 --> 38:02.574
Here. Good. Oh, good.

38:03.575 --> 38:04.701
Shelter advised.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.539
500 feet.

38:13.085 --> 38:14.711
Get back in here.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.132
Come on! Get back in!

38:23.971 --> 38:26.014
We gotta be inside right now!

38:29.601 --> 38:31.061
Shelter advised.

38:33.605 --> 38:34.439
Get in the back.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.733
-The back. The back.-Dewey! Not you.

38:36.817 --> 38:37.818
300 feet.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.778
Finch, what should I do?

38:39.862 --> 38:41.238
Hang on to something.

38:41.321 --> 38:43.323
-200 feet.-Who's a good boy?

38:44.658 --> 38:45.701
Holding on, Finch.

38:53.834 --> 38:57.004
50 feet. Extreme caution.

38:57.087 --> 38:58.589
Shelter advised.

39:46.929 --> 39:48.222
I am okay.

39:49.848 --> 39:51.225
Everyone okay?

39:51.308 --> 39:52.726
You good, boy?

39:52.809 --> 39:54.478
Dewey? You?

39:56.563 --> 39:59.316
Thanks. I wondered what happened to that.

40:12.996 --> 40:14.581
This could have gone better.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.671
He used his muscle on that.

40:26.802 --> 40:28.887
Hey. Good job.

40:39.398 --> 40:40.649
Finch.

40:40.732 --> 40:42.025
Damn it.

40:45.696 --> 40:50.617
We have been very fortunate.Extremely fortunate.

40:52.286 --> 40:56.874
The Fleetwood Southwindis not known for its safety features.

40:56.957 --> 40:59.168
-Did you know that---Did you find the jack?

41:03.422 --> 41:06.633
I have located a spare but no jack.

41:08.093 --> 41:11.096
Great. Shredded tire, no jack.

41:12.347 --> 41:15.767
Mistakes will get you killed, Weinberg.You should know that by now.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.477
Finch.

41:21.523 --> 41:22.566
Initiative.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.411
All right.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.496
Okay, let her down.

41:38.665 --> 41:39.625
Good.

41:45.589 --> 41:48.050
I really enjoyed being a jack.

41:49.384 --> 41:51.386
You do make a good jack.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.390
You know, we...

41:57.059 --> 42:00.395
We should consider giving you a name. We should consider giving you a name.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.941
I would like that very much.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.150
Well, how about Jack?

42:06.902 --> 42:08.737
No, Jack is a tool's name.

42:10.697 --> 42:15.035
How about William Shakespeare?Will you call me William Shakespeare?

42:15.118 --> 42:16.161
That's taken.

42:17.704 --> 42:21.083
Maybe something a little less complicated.You know? Keep it simple.

42:22.543 --> 42:24.545
Napoleon Bonaparte.

42:25.379 --> 42:27.464
Napoleon was short.

42:30.259 --> 42:32.469
And what is wrong with being short?

42:32.553 --> 42:36.265
Nothing at all. It's just thatyou are not short. You're very tall.

42:37.766 --> 42:39.268
I am very tall.

42:43.397 --> 42:45.482
I like the name Rover.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.610
Rover is a dog's name.

42:48.694 --> 42:52.072
I was thinking ofthe early Mars planetary lander.

42:52.155 --> 42:57.452
Okay. Still, maybe somethinga little less complicated or appropriate.

42:57.536 --> 43:00.372
Maybe you want somethingthat's not already a dog's name? Maybe you want somethingthat's not already a dog's name?

43:01.790 --> 43:02.791
No.

43:04.501 --> 43:06.920
Why doesn't the dog have a name?

43:07.379 --> 43:08.589
He does have a name.

43:09.965 --> 43:11.133
It's Goodyear.

43:11.675 --> 43:13.635
I like that name.

43:13.719 --> 43:16.847
Why not use it? He is your dog after all.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.265
Well, he's not my dog.

43:20.184 --> 43:21.643
He is his own dog.

43:22.978 --> 43:25.772
Besides, with just the two of us,who needs names?

43:36.116 --> 43:37.159
Jeff.

43:39.536 --> 43:40.704
Jeff?

43:40.787 --> 43:42.623
Jeff.

43:44.333 --> 43:46.585
Jeff. Really?

43:47.461 --> 43:49.129
Have I said something funny?

43:49.213 --> 43:51.840
No. No, absolutely not. No.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.675
It is short and simple.

43:53.759 --> 43:54.760
Yes, it is.

43:54.843 --> 43:57.679
-Just like you suggested, Finch.-Yeah.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.806
And I've checked.

44:01.558 --> 44:03.727
It isn't a dog's name.

44:03.810 --> 44:05.479
No, it's not. For the life of me,

44:05.562 --> 44:09.983
I cannot ever remembera dog named Jeff, so...

44:10.442 --> 44:12.736
Then, with your permission, Finch...

44:13.445 --> 44:14.863
None required.

44:14.947 --> 44:16.156
Give me your hand.

44:16.657 --> 44:18.283
Other hand. Corresponding hand.

44:18.742 --> 44:20.077
And shake hands.

44:20.577 --> 44:23.080
Welcome to the world, Jeff.

44:42.933 --> 44:44.935
Hey, hey, hey!

44:47.688 --> 44:50.524
What's going on with all the fuss?

44:50.607 --> 44:55.070
I thought our communication might improveif I learn to talk dog.

45:02.327 --> 45:04.580
I have made a comparative analysis.

45:04.663 --> 45:08.041
I believe I have isolatedseveral root phonetic units.

45:09.126 --> 45:12.880
However, it seems to have misunderstoodeverything I have said.

45:12.963 --> 45:16.049
-What is the matter with it, Finch?-It's not an "it."

45:17.551 --> 45:18.635
It's a "him."

45:19.553 --> 45:21.722
There's no such thing as dog talk.

45:22.222 --> 45:24.224
I don't think it likes me.

45:26.143 --> 45:27.769
Well, he doesn't trust you yet.

45:29.605 --> 45:31.315
That takes time.

46:23.742 --> 46:28.956
Finch, I'm not sure I understandthis concept of trust.

46:29.373 --> 46:31.875
Can you explain for me, please?

46:31.959 --> 46:35.254
Okay. Trust is when we...

46:38.173 --> 46:42.678
Well, trust is how we, you know, trust.

46:42.761 --> 46:43.762
It's...

46:44.847 --> 46:46.765
Well, how about if I tell you a story?

46:47.057 --> 46:50.644
Are you going to tell mea story about trust?

46:51.061 --> 46:53.105
Well, it's a story about me. All right.

46:54.731 --> 46:59.194
All right, so once upon a time,

46:59.278 --> 47:02.322
back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha, back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha,

47:03.115 --> 47:06.702
word came from up topthat I was gonna be put on a team

47:06.785 --> 47:09.162
that was developing the RMS system.

47:09.621 --> 47:12.374
Problem was that I didn't reallylike working on a team,

47:12.457 --> 47:14.334
-so I was having some problems---Why didn't you like

47:14.418 --> 47:15.627
working on a team, Finch?

47:15.711 --> 47:17.880
Because my teamwas a bunch of knuckleheads.

47:17.963 --> 47:20.299
-Put that down. Put that down.-What's a knuckle--

47:20.382 --> 47:21.550
What's a knucklehead?

47:21.633 --> 47:25.929
I just worked better by myself, okay?Now listen.

47:29.266 --> 47:30.767
-Listening.-All right.

47:30.851 --> 47:35.189
Now, we were having real problemsgetting the OS to talk to the hardware.

47:35.272 --> 47:39.860
And the team was certainthat it was a hardware issue.

47:39.943 --> 47:42.821
But I knew it wasn't.It was something else.

47:42.905 --> 47:44.406
And guess who cracked it?

47:48.994 --> 47:50.621
Well, anyway, that doesn't matter.

47:51.246 --> 47:52.706
The next thing I know,

47:52.789 --> 47:58.295
is Doctor Norman Rostoker,who founded TAE Technologies,

47:58.378 --> 47:59.630
he pays us a visit.

48:00.047 --> 48:02.007
And that is a big deal.

48:02.090 --> 48:06.053
He pats us on the backand then he singles me out.

48:06.136 --> 48:07.679
He says, "Weinberg."

48:09.848 --> 48:11.642
The man knows my name.

48:12.684 --> 48:13.810
That's right. He said,

48:13.894 --> 48:19.191
"Weinberg, I heard you figured this outall by yourself. Is that true?"

48:20.108 --> 48:22.319
And I had to think about thatfor a minute.

48:22.945 --> 48:25.489
But then I knew what I had to say.

48:25.572 --> 48:28.992
And so I told himI couldn't have done it without my team.

48:29.076 --> 48:31.745
But you said your team werea bunch of knuckleheads.

48:31.828 --> 48:34.790
Well, he looked me right in the eye,and he knew I was lying.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.710
But he also knew I had my team's back.

48:39.336 --> 48:43.131
So he gave me this wink and told us all,

48:43.215 --> 48:45.801
"Teamwork. That's the key."

48:47.511 --> 48:48.971
Teamwork is the key.

48:49.054 --> 48:50.222
-Yeah.-Wink, wink.

48:50.305 --> 48:51.306
That's right.

48:53.767 --> 48:54.810
That's right.

49:03.777 --> 49:08.198
I'm not sure I understandwhat the story was about, Finch.

49:09.157 --> 49:11.702
-Well, think about it.-I am.

49:11.785 --> 49:15.080
It's about building trustand getting other people to trust you.

49:15.163 --> 49:18.792
Yes, but you didn't actuallytrust your team, Finch.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.336
And I found the storyquite hard to follow.

49:21.420 --> 49:22.671
May I suggest--

49:24.047 --> 49:25.090
Finch.

49:26.049 --> 49:28.594
Finch, would you like me to drive?

49:55.120 --> 50:00.334
-UV radiation detected, 141 degrees.-I just need a few minutes. -UV radiation detected, 141 degrees.-I just need a few minutes.

50:00.417 --> 50:01.710
I want you two...

50:04.379 --> 50:07.007
to start working on...

50:08.217 --> 50:10.093
that trust.

50:10.177 --> 50:11.678
-Okay?-Like in the story?

50:11.762 --> 50:14.389
Yeah, yeah. Just like in the story.

50:15.265 --> 50:16.683
Stay in the shade.

50:48.924 --> 50:49.925
Come on.

50:53.512 --> 50:54.680
Come on.

51:00.519 --> 51:02.145
-Hey, no.-Come on.

51:02.229 --> 51:04.064
No. No, no, not that way.

51:04.147 --> 51:05.691
-Come on.-Come on.

51:05.774 --> 51:06.984
Come here. Okay, okay.

51:07.067 --> 51:08.610
Give me this. Give me this.

51:08.694 --> 51:10.279
Hey, come on, boy. Come on.

51:11.238 --> 51:12.322
There you go. Yeah.

51:12.406 --> 51:14.408
I told you he doesn't like me.

51:14.992 --> 51:17.744
You just stay here.

51:18.829 --> 51:19.872
Guard the fort.

52:06.043 --> 52:07.377
What should we have?

52:09.004 --> 52:10.797
Get your elbows off the table.

52:10.881 --> 52:14.676
Get your elbows off the table.Off the table. Down.

52:30.526 --> 52:32.027
Mac and cheese.

52:37.991 --> 52:39.993
I'm gonna get a triple-decker turkey club.

52:48.210 --> 52:49.253
Shit.

52:49.336 --> 52:50.379
Stay.

52:57.511 --> 52:58.512
Hey!

52:59.096 --> 53:00.681
No! Hey, hey, come. Hey. No! Hey, hey, come. Hey.

53:00.764 --> 53:02.432
Come here. Good, good, good.

53:05.561 --> 53:06.687
Stay.

53:09.273 --> 53:10.691
Hey, what's going on, Jeff?

53:13.235 --> 53:14.319
Nothing.

53:16.738 --> 53:18.782
Did you just drive the RV?

53:19.533 --> 53:20.492
No.

53:22.703 --> 53:23.871
No?

53:23.954 --> 53:26.707
It did roll though.

53:28.500 --> 53:29.877
Oh, okay. Good.

53:29.960 --> 53:34.173
Because I don't think you're quite readyto drive the RV yet.

53:35.424 --> 53:37.593
I have seen you drive.

53:40.762 --> 53:42.097
Are you upset?

53:44.725 --> 53:46.602
I need you to listen to me, okay?

53:48.103 --> 53:49.146
Okay.

53:49.229 --> 53:52.691
I want you to fetch the UV suitand bring it to me.

53:53.734 --> 53:57.237
The helmet, the cooling unit,everything, okay?

53:59.990 --> 54:01.074
Okay. Okay.

54:01.742 --> 54:03.202
Is that understood?

54:04.244 --> 54:05.495
Understood.

54:28.352 --> 54:30.562
No, no! No!

54:31.313 --> 54:32.439
No!

54:32.981 --> 54:33.982
No, no!

54:34.066 --> 54:35.108
No!

54:35.192 --> 54:36.193
I meant on foot!

54:36.777 --> 54:39.071
No, stop! Stop!

54:43.742 --> 54:45.702
I am an excellent driver.

54:48.455 --> 54:49.498
Come here.

55:07.432 --> 55:12.437
UV doesn't discriminate.Dog skin, human skin, they both fry.

55:13.272 --> 55:15.899
-I thought you wanted me---You have one job to do.

55:15.983 --> 55:18.819
Take care of this dog.It's the reason I made you.

55:18.902 --> 55:20.988
It's the only reason you exist.

55:21.071 --> 55:22.114
The fourth directive.

55:22.197 --> 55:24.157
I don't need companionship.I don't need a friend.

55:24.241 --> 55:25.826
I need you to do your job.

55:26.869 --> 55:27.870
I'm sorry. I am--

55:27.953 --> 55:31.123
I know you were born yesterday,but it's time for you to grow up!

55:53.896 --> 55:57.733
God's honest truth, you werea crazy gamble from start to finish.

56:00.986 --> 56:03.655
You just need to understandhow vulnerable we are.

56:08.660 --> 56:09.661
What do you think?

56:11.830 --> 56:13.790
Now is as good a time as any.

56:14.666 --> 56:15.751
What for?

56:21.215 --> 56:23.342
Now gently. Very gently.

56:24.635 --> 56:26.637
Give it just a little gas.

56:27.054 --> 56:28.180
Don't rush it.

56:29.306 --> 56:30.933
Just very gently.

56:32.017 --> 56:33.227
That's not gently.

56:33.310 --> 56:35.479
-Sorry.-You know what gently means.

56:35.562 --> 56:36.563
Easy.

56:38.524 --> 56:39.733
Easy now. Easy.

56:40.943 --> 56:42.027
Easy.

56:46.782 --> 56:47.783
Don't oversteer.

56:50.035 --> 56:52.412
Yeah, you've oversteered.That's oversteering.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.498
-Sorry.-Ease your foot up just a hair.

56:57.417 --> 56:58.418
Good.

57:00.003 --> 57:01.004
Good.

57:02.089 --> 57:04.341
All right. Now keep it steady,just like this.

57:05.425 --> 57:06.718
Perfect.

57:12.474 --> 57:13.892
I know-- Eyes on the road.

57:15.936 --> 57:18.397
Now, she's a little thirsty,but I made some modifications.

57:18.480 --> 57:22.901
So if we can keep it steady,under 50, we should be okay.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.321
Good. Yeah.

57:27.990 --> 57:29.825
I am an excellent driver.

57:29.908 --> 57:31.702
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

57:31.785 --> 57:32.953
Eyes on the road.

57:36.206 --> 57:38.625
See, rain man? You're just an apprentice.

57:39.751 --> 57:42.004
Then I am an excellent apprentice.

58:03.358 --> 58:07.321
San Francisco, here we come!

58:19.750 --> 58:22.711
What a cold night. It's been a long time.

58:26.173 --> 58:27.424
Finch.

58:28.509 --> 58:30.552
It's the aurora borealis.

58:32.179 --> 58:33.180
Yeah?

58:33.722 --> 58:36.934
Only now you don't have to bein Alaska to see it.

58:38.060 --> 58:39.728
You can thank the flare for that.

58:40.896 --> 58:42.189
Goodbye, ozone.

58:44.316 --> 58:46.568
Goodbye, feeling the sun on your face.

58:48.737 --> 58:52.574
Vegetation and crops and food.Goodbye, everything.

58:59.081 --> 59:00.415
And yet, here we are. And yet, here we are.

59:03.085 --> 59:04.086
Yes.

59:04.795 --> 59:06.380
Here we are, Finch.

59:10.759 --> 59:12.511
May I ask you something?

59:13.929 --> 59:18.517
If daylight is so dangerous,why are we not traveling at night?

59:20.811 --> 59:26.191
You think if traveling at night were safe,I wouldn't know that by now?

59:28.569 --> 59:29.695
Where are we headed?

59:31.530 --> 59:33.323
The Golden Gate Bridge.

59:33.407 --> 59:35.117
Into the unknown.

59:38.161 --> 59:44.459
Dust and smoke and 150-degree heatand UV radiation, that I can handle.

59:44.960 --> 59:45.961
Why?

59:47.212 --> 59:48.213
Why?

59:48.922 --> 59:50.424
Because it's predictable.

59:53.177 --> 59:58.765
Moving at night presentsthat which is not predictable.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.769
People.

01:00:04.938 --> 01:00:08.275
Starving people hiding in the shadows.People who mean you harm.

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:09.651
People you cannot trust.

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:12.571
But why? How do you knowyou can't trust those people?

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:14.364
Because trust will get you killed.

01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:17.367
Trust no one.

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.339
You're mad at me again.

01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:46.146
Look, things will happen to you.

01:00:48.899 --> 01:00:50.526
Things that you cannot control.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.696
Raw emotion will find you.

01:00:55.405 --> 01:01:00.494
When it does, how you deal with it,what you do... When it does, how you deal with it,what you do...

01:01:01.411 --> 01:01:03.038
will define who you are.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.378
Did that happen to you?

01:01:10.379 --> 01:01:12.214
It happens to all of us.

01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:14.716
Whether we want it to or not.

01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:28.355
It's too cold.

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.859
Too cold for these old bones.

01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:45.497
Finch, I think I might stay here awhileif that's okay with you.

01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:48.500
Okay.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:49.960
Okay.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.021
You're unwell.

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:01.990
What would you like me to do?

01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:07.746
Call a doctor.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.851
Good boy. Stay.

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:55.729
Come on, Dewey.

01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:57.397
Let's get this show on the road.

01:04:59.107 --> 01:05:01.276
Lesson number one: Lesson number one:

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.239
Never pass on the opportunityfor your next meal.

01:05:07.824 --> 01:05:10.244
Lesson number two...

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:13.539
Never willfully destroyanother person's property.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:17.709
But a little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:21.129
That's a figure of speech, by the way.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:32.307
Come, Dewey.

01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:39.690
Lesson number three:

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.736
Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:50.158
UV radiation high, 144 degrees.

01:05:50.242 --> 01:05:51.285
Caution.

01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:57.332
Hey.

01:06:01.712 --> 01:06:02.713
Stay here.

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:05.090
Guard the fort.

01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:11.930
Oh, no.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:18.187
Lesson number four: Use your initiative.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:58.310
Medicine.

01:06:58.393 --> 01:06:59.603
Medicine.

01:06:59.686 --> 01:07:00.729
Initiative. Initiative.

01:07:07.611 --> 01:07:10.614
Lesson number five: Live a little.

01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:20.666
Not bad.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.087
Stay, boy.

01:08:21.727 --> 01:08:24.938
Initiative, initiative,initiative, initiative!

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:02.518
Oh, no.

01:09:15.154 --> 01:09:16.323
I'm sorry, Dewey.

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:42.724
Come on.

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:54.570
Finch.

01:09:55.529 --> 01:09:57.406
Do you like my new coat?

01:09:57.489 --> 01:09:58.448
What are you doing?

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:00.826
Have you listened to me at all? Have you listened to me at all?

01:10:00.909 --> 01:10:03.453
But-- But initiative, Finch.

01:10:03.871 --> 01:10:06.164
Initiative requires common sense.

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:08.917
If you had any, you'd knowthere's something wrong with this place.

01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:13.380
Finch, do you think--

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:14.464
Walk away now.

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:23.182
Finch.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.062
Where's Dewey?

01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:30.689
Dewey's gone.

01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:43.076
Heart rate high, 150 bpm.

01:10:45.204 --> 01:10:46.163
The door. Get the door.

01:10:54.755 --> 01:10:55.964
Caution.

01:10:56.048 --> 01:10:57.591
Heart rate high.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:21.615
Here, take this.

01:11:23.242 --> 01:11:25.327
-Caution.-Now come take the wheel.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.455
Body temperature high, 104.8.

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:31.291
Blood pressure high.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.876
-May I make a suggestion---No!

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:36.463
No, you may not. That was a trapand you walked right into it.

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:41.510
Dewey was one of us and now he's goneall because of your stupid mistake.

01:11:42.094 --> 01:11:44.555
-Caution. Heart rate high.-Come on, boy.

01:11:44.638 --> 01:11:46.723
Come on. Here, boy. Come on, boy. Go. Go.

01:11:48.767 --> 01:11:51.270
From now on, there's a new set of rules.

01:11:51.353 --> 01:11:53.981
No more mistakes.We can't afford that anymore.

01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:01.613
What would you like me to do?

01:12:01.697 --> 01:12:03.866
Drive. We need the miles.

01:12:40.235 --> 01:12:41.320
Are you okay?

01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:43.322
We're being followed.

01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:45.282
We are?

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:46.992
By who?

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:48.327
I don't want to find out.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.498
You can still see, right?

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.126
I can see.

01:13:03.759 --> 01:13:05.302
We-- We have to lose him.

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:08.263
Floor it. Floor it.Put your foot on the gas.

01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:11.475
-But the Fleetwood manual says---Do it. Just do it. Do it now!

01:13:32.496 --> 01:13:33.997
Go. Go! Go faster.

01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:44.716
May I make a suggestion, Finch?

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.052
-We have to get off this road.-What are you doing?

01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:49.096
-Overpass. That means an underpass.-I don't understand.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.599
Now. Now! Hard left!

01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:11.869
Go. Go! Why are you stopping?

01:14:11.952 --> 01:14:13.745
We have to hide! Go!

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:15.414
We have to go now!

01:14:15.497 --> 01:14:16.957
-Finch, I think---Now! Go!

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.041
Finch.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.586
Maximum height ofthis particular underpass

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.462
is 13 feet and 7 inches.

01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:24.840
With the basic customizationsof the vehicle, we're--

01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:27.176
Finch!

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.228
-Finch?-What have I done?

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:48.614
No! No, Jeff!

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.838
I think they're gone, Finch.

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:40.642
We're not gonna make it.

01:16:48.859 --> 01:16:49.902
It's over.

01:16:54.489 --> 01:16:59.953
I'm too old. I'm too sick.I'm too tired. I'm done.

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:03.498
Finch, it's gonna rain.You know what that means--

01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:05.584
Stop it. Stop it. Just accept it.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:07.836
It's over.

01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:10.047
No.

01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:11.757
We can't give up.

01:17:12.549 --> 01:17:14.927
I will not allow you to give up.

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.094
You will not allow it?

01:17:16.178 --> 01:17:19.515
Well, you don't get to decidebecause you're just a machine.

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:21.850
A robot cannot harm a human or,through inaction,

01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:23.352
allow a human to come to harm.

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.436
Shut up!

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:33.463
May I ask you something?

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:38.552
Do you think we'll make itto the Golden Gate Bridge?

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:43.223
I think we will.

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:47.060
You wanna know why?

01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:51.857
Because I believe in you, Finch.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.655
Can I tell you a story?

01:19:01.825 --> 01:19:02.868
Okay.

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:05.120
Once upon a time...

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:08.332
there was a solar flare.

01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:19.301
But the flare didn't finish us off.We did that to ourselves.

01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:25.432
Some people hid and locked their doors.

01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:27.935
Tried to pretendthat it wasn't really happening.

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:29.645
And they didn't last very long.

01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:34.149
The rest of us did what we had to doto survive.

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.778
We scavenged and we fought overwhatever was left behind

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:39.488
until there was nothing left.

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:46.370
I was searching this supermarket.

01:19:47.246 --> 01:19:49.665
And the place had beenpretty well cleaned out,

01:19:49.748 --> 01:19:55.546
but occasionally something gets overlookedand you get lucky.

01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.217
And I found a bag of noodles. And I found a bag of noodles.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.848
But before I could leave...

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:11.270
this mother and her kid show up,

01:20:11.353 --> 01:20:14.690
and they have a shopping cartfilled with their things.

01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:17.484
The little girl couldn't have beenmore than nine years old.

01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:21.029
She had a pink unicorn backpack.

01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:26.451
And she was holding a gun in her hands.

01:20:27.703 --> 01:20:31.832
And I heard the mom say,"Remember, if you see anyone,

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:35.210
you point at themand you do like I showed you, okay?"

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.923
And then I realized that if she sees me,

01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:43.218
this little girl's gonna shoot meand take my noodles.

01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:46.471
So I hid.

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:51.643
And waited until they were done.

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.609
But as they were leaving,this station wagon pulled up.

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:04.573
And the driver got outbecause he'd seen the little girl.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:08.160
And he was yelling,

01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:12.164
and he was waving a shotgun aroundlike a crazy man.

01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:16.168
He'd seen the cartand he wanted what was in it.

01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:19.254
So he was hollering,"Hand it over. Hand it over."

01:21:19.338 --> 01:21:22.424
And then the mom ran upand she was yelling at him,

01:21:22.508 --> 01:21:23.967
"Leave us alone."

01:21:25.344 --> 01:21:28.055
And the little girl is terrified and...

01:21:29.223 --> 01:21:31.642
she didn't know where to point the gun.

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:35.979
She was crying.

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:39.233
And they were both screaming.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.364
And then bang, bang, bang.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.585
It all happened so fast.

01:22:04.007 --> 01:22:08.971
By the time he leftand I was able to get to them,

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.806
it was too late.

01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:24.027
Then I heard this sound.

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.366
This tiny whimpering...

01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:35.455
coming from the girl's pink backpack.

01:22:43.922 --> 01:22:45.424
And so I opened it.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:00.731
And there was this shivering,tiny, little thing. And there was this shivering,tiny, little thing.

01:23:03.442 --> 01:23:05.068
So frightened.

01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:07.988
And so alone.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.331
Hunger turned men into murderers.

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.250
But made...

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:24.630
made me a coward.

01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.306
How can you believe in that?

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:10.968
You see that?

01:24:13.011 --> 01:24:14.263
San Francisco.

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:17.182
Finch.

01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:20.811
Only 480 miles.

01:24:31.947 --> 01:24:32.948
"Dad."

01:24:34.908 --> 01:24:35.909
Dad.

01:24:43.584 --> 01:24:46.837
UV radiation low. Non-critical.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:12.571
I think you need to come and see this.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:15.490
-Finch!-What?

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:18.744
-What?-Right there.

01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:24.333
I didn't mean to hit it.

01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.031
I thought you said it...

01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:58.408
Swiss cheese.

01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:18.762
I don't know.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.835
This is excellent, Jeff.

01:28:13.794 --> 01:28:16.588
This is the best meal I've hadin a long, long time.

01:28:24.638 --> 01:28:25.889
Guess what?

01:28:25.973 --> 01:28:26.974
What?

01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:31.770
I saw it in my head last night.

01:28:31.854 --> 01:28:33.272
In your head?

01:28:33.939 --> 01:28:38.026
The three of us were onthe Golden Gate Bridge,

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.445
like a painting that hasn't been yet.

01:28:42.906 --> 01:28:43.991
Wow!

01:28:46.368 --> 01:28:48.078
Jeff, you had a dream?

01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:53.500
That blows my mind.

01:28:54.126 --> 01:28:57.546
I would love to see youfive or six years from now.

01:28:59.131 --> 01:29:00.924
I'm not a disappointment? I'm not a disappointment?

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:03.177
Of course not. No.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:07.181
And I shouldn't have called you a machine.

01:29:09.057 --> 01:29:11.018
May I ask you something?

01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:15.564
You said that the Golden Gate Bridge cardwas from your uncle,

01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:19.651
but on the back it's signed "Dad."

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.529
Why is that?

01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:25.741
Boy, you don't miss a thing, do you?

01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:27.242
No, I don't.

01:29:28.827 --> 01:29:32.456
Well, I think it's time for another story.

01:29:38.295 --> 01:29:39.296
Well...

01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:47.596
My mom always said my dadhad Viking blood in him.

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:51.767
You didn't say, "Once upon a time."

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:55.312
Okay. And once upon a time...

01:29:56.271 --> 01:29:57.272
he left us.

01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:01.193
It was before I was born. It was before I was born.

01:30:02.194 --> 01:30:03.195
He was in the army.

01:30:03.278 --> 01:30:07.866
An engineer of some kind, evidently.Built bridges.

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:11.119
And he was always traveling.We never had any contact.

01:30:11.203 --> 01:30:17.751
And then on my 15th birthday,that postcard shows up out of the blue.

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.295
The one with the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:30:20.754 --> 01:30:23.590
And he wrote on ithe hoped we could meet one day.

01:30:24.758 --> 01:30:29.346
Meantime I was supposed togo off and see the world.

01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:32.808
And he signed it "Dad" and I treasured it.

01:30:34.142 --> 01:30:37.729
In fact, as soon as I was old enough,I went out and I bought this fancy suit.

01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:41.066
And I thought, well,when we finally do meet,

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:44.653
I wanted to impress himand make him feel proud of me.

01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:49.449
Never heard from him again.

01:30:54.705 --> 01:30:55.873
And did you?

01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:58.333
Did I what?

01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:00.085
Did you go see the world? Did you go see the world?

01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:05.132
Well, I went to New York City once.

01:31:05.215 --> 01:31:07.134
-Yeah?-I didn't much care for it.

01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:09.219
It was crowded and dirty.

01:31:10.345 --> 01:31:14.224
And apart from that I've never beenmuch further than Missouri.

01:31:14.308 --> 01:31:15.893
But there was always something.

01:31:15.976 --> 01:31:21.481
You know, my health or my work,Mom, the end of the world.

01:31:25.694 --> 01:31:26.778
Yeah, I...

01:31:28.572 --> 01:31:30.407
I just never got around to it.

01:31:36.121 --> 01:31:38.832
What about the other postcards?Why are they all blank?

01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:43.921
Well, whenever I saw one I liked,I would buy it.

01:31:44.755 --> 01:31:48.258
You know, sort of a collection.Something for the bucket list, I guess.

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:49.551
I don't know.

01:31:52.638 --> 01:31:55.057
Like, we humansare full of contradictions.

01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:01.772
You see, you can already tell me You see, you can already tell me

01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:04.441
how many rivetsare in the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:08.946
And how many miles of cable were usedand how high it is.

01:32:09.571 --> 01:32:14.618
But it's not until you actuallystand on it and see the beauty,

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:19.081
and listen to the suspension cablessinging in the wind...

01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:20.582
That's experience.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:23.710
That's human experience.

01:32:23.794 --> 01:32:28.090
It's not just imagining, it's living.

01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:33.720
But you've never actually beento the Golden Gate Bridge, Finch.

01:32:36.098 --> 01:32:37.724
No, Jeff, I've never been.

01:32:37.808 --> 01:32:39.184
Thank you.

01:32:40.143 --> 01:32:43.188
Like I said,humans are full of contradictions.

01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:49.653
I wish I'd done more with the time I had.

01:32:54.283 --> 01:32:56.326
Well, then let's leave right now, Finch!

01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:57.578
We'll leave right now.

01:32:57.661 --> 01:33:01.915
And if we leave right now,it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes-- And if we leave right now,it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes--

01:33:01.999 --> 01:33:03.542
I'm dying, Jeff.

01:33:05.586 --> 01:33:06.795
I'm gonna die.

01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:19.933
When I'm gone...

01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:24.730
do you promiseto do what's right for Goodyear?

01:33:44.249 --> 01:33:45.375
Where's your ball?

01:33:46.084 --> 01:33:48.253
Is it here? Is that your ball?

01:33:49.296 --> 01:33:50.714
Is that your ball?

01:33:51.548 --> 01:33:55.177
Is that your ball?

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.096
Where's your ball? Where's your ball?

01:34:02.935 --> 01:34:04.645
Go! Get it.

01:34:11.652 --> 01:34:14.530
Come on. All right. Okay.

01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:15.822
Now you try it.

01:34:17.032 --> 01:34:18.992
Yeah. Yeah. You throw it.

01:34:21.662 --> 01:34:22.788
Go ahead. Throw it.

01:34:23.956 --> 01:34:25.916
This kind of stuff's important.

01:34:26.542 --> 01:34:27.876
Where's your ball?

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.671
Where's your ball? Is it here? Is it here?

01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:32.297
Just throw it.

01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:34.258
Is this your ball?

01:34:35.092 --> 01:34:36.301
Is this your ball?

01:34:36.927 --> 01:34:38.804
-Throw the ball.-Here, boy.

01:34:39.638 --> 01:34:40.681
Where's your ball?

01:34:41.223 --> 01:34:42.558
Throw the ball.

01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:43.725
Come on!

01:34:51.567 --> 01:34:52.651
Hey, Finch!

01:34:52.734 --> 01:34:54.069
Yeah.

01:34:55.612 --> 01:34:56.780
Here, boy!

01:34:58.615 --> 01:35:00.617
Come on, boy. No. Come on, boy. No.

01:35:10.544 --> 01:35:12.588
-Again.-But he returned it to you.

01:35:13.172 --> 01:35:15.716
Well, that's 'cause dogsare creatures of habit.

01:35:41.783 --> 01:35:42.784
Here, boy!

01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:44.703
Come on.

01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:46.371
Please?

01:35:47.664 --> 01:35:48.665
Do it.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.627
Good boy. Good--

01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:00.552
I told you he doesn't like me. I told you he doesn't like me.

01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:03.597
You two will-- You'll figure it out.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.141
Come on. Trust me.

01:36:26.787 --> 01:36:29.414
Look what I did to ruin my fancy suit.

01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:34.461
I got you.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.421
It's okay.

01:36:40.634 --> 01:36:41.635
It's okay.

01:36:43.136 --> 01:36:45.264
Try and breathe, Finch. Try and breathe.

01:36:51.186 --> 01:36:53.814
I'm just gonna lay down for a while.You two play.

01:36:54.398 --> 01:36:55.607
You two go.

01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:58.694
-Go play.-Can I do something, Finch?

01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:06.785
Jeff, you already have.

01:37:08.453 --> 01:37:09.663
Shake my hand.

01:38:00.047 --> 01:38:01.048
No.

01:38:01.507 --> 01:38:02.508
No.

01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:09.379
What am I gonna do?

01:42:14.134 --> 01:42:15.135
What am I gonna do?

01:42:21.183 --> 01:42:22.809
What are you gonna do, Jeff?

01:42:26.563 --> 01:42:27.981
What would Finch do?

01:42:30.234 --> 01:42:31.443
He'd feed the dog.

01:42:33.612 --> 01:42:34.655
I'm gonna feed the dog.

01:42:50.546 --> 01:42:51.588
Oh, shit.

01:46:00.444 --> 01:46:03.197
You see, you can already tell me

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.116
how many rivets arein the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:46:07.743 --> 01:46:11.955
And how many miles of cable were usedand how high it is.

01:46:15.584 --> 01:46:20.964
But it's not until you actuallystand on it and see the beauty,

01:46:21.048 --> 01:46:24.843
and listen to the suspension cablessinging in the wind...

01:46:26.553 --> 01:46:27.763
That's experience.

01:46:30.724 --> 01:46:32.518
That's human experience.

01:46:38.732 --> 01:46:41.443
Looks like we're not the only oneswho came this way.

01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:48.200
You think they're still out there?

01:46:51.328 --> 01:46:53.288
Well, there's only one way to find out.

01:47:05.008 --> 01:47:06.218
It's beautiful.

01:47:07.553 --> 01:47:09.596
Finch knew what he was talking about.

01:47:12.307 --> 01:47:13.559
Hey, how about a story?

01:47:14.476 --> 01:47:17.437
Okay, so once upon a time...
