10:22.322 --> 10:24.354
THERE'S THREE OF YOU, RIGHT?

10:24.354 --> 10:27.958
HUH? WELL,
THERE IS PLENTY

10:27.958 --> 10:30.731
FOR EVERYONE.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.703
HUH?

10:32.703 --> 10:34.104
HMM?

10:34.104 --> 10:37.107
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE
A LOT OF FUN WITH THIS.

10:37.107 --> 10:39.639
AND WAIT.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.042
THERE'S MORE.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.715
[GUNSHOT]

10:44.715 --> 10:45.776
WHOA! WHOA!

10:45.776 --> 10:47.848
I'M NOT GOIN' BACK.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.853
[GRUNTS]
[YELLING]

10:54.925 --> 10:55.786
WHOO!

10:55.786 --> 10:57.988
THAT'S IT?
YEAH.

10:57.988 --> 10:59.389
OW.

10:59.389 --> 11:01.261
[ALL BREATHING HEAVILY]

11:01.261 --> 11:03.263
THAT GUY SUCKED!

11:04.394 --> 11:06.867
GUYS...

11:13.143 --> 11:16.246
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE REST
OF THE MONEY

11:16.246 --> 11:19.349
JOHNSON AND HIS PARTNER
KILLED EACH OTHER OVER.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.283
AH-A!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.166
HEY, GLADYS.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.968
CAN I PLACE THE VESSEL
ON THE MAT?

11:37.968 --> 11:41.972
PLACE THE VESSEL
ON THE MAT.

11:41.972 --> 11:44.274
YEAH.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.786
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.420
REJECTED?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.152
HOLD ON,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:02.152 --> 12:04.354
IF YOU WISH TO APPEAL
THE REJECTION,

12:04.354 --> 12:06.326
FILL OUT FORM 23-7.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.399
TYPICAL RESPONSE TIME
IS 6 TO 8 WEEKS.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.863
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS
IN THE MEANTIME?

12:14.004 --> 12:17.337
REALLY, REALLY,
YOU'RE GONNA PUT UP
A SIGN IN FRONT OF ME

12:17.337 --> 12:18.909
AND PRETEND I'M NOT HERE?

12:18.909 --> 12:21.972
GLADYS, COME ON!

12:21.972 --> 12:24.274
[SIGHS]

12:32.052 --> 12:35.055
HELL IS LIKE THE WORST RUN
BUSINESS EVER.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.387
WON'T LET ME TURN IN THE SOUL.

12:37.387 --> 12:38.929
UH-HUH.

12:38.929 --> 12:42.762
OH. SO THAT'S WHAT
$6 MILLION LOOKS LIKE, HUH?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.263
YEAH.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.866
I WAS GONNA GET NAKED
AND ROLL AROUND IN IT,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.237
BUT I DIDN'T
SHOWER TODAY.

12:47.237 --> 12:49.099
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET THE MONEY DIRTY.

12:49.099 --> 12:50.270
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.301
KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO?

12:51.301 --> 12:54.344
WE SHOULD BUY
3 FIGHTER JETS.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.476
MAVERICK, ICE MAN, GOOSE.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.908
WHOA, GOOSE DIED.

12:57.908 --> 12:58.849
I DON'T WANT
TO BE GOOSE.

12:58.849 --> 13:00.110
NO, SOCK,
THIS ISN'T OUR MONEY.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.782
ICE, YOU ARE KILLING ME
WITH THIS ATTITUDE.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.085
ALL RIGHT, IF THIS
ISN'T OURS, WHOSE IS IT?

13:05.085 --> 13:07.858
HEY, WE RISKED
OUR LIVES TO NAB
THE SOUL.

13:07.858 --> 13:09.789
I MEAN,
WE'RE ENTITLED
TO SPEND IT.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.863
NO, THAT MONEY IS STOLEN.
IT STILL IS STOLEN.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.324
OH, MY GOD!

13:14.324 --> 13:15.325
ALL RIGHT, FINE, SAM!

13:15.325 --> 13:18.798
YOU DON'T WANT US
TO HAVE ANY OF THIS
BEAUTIFUL MONEY?

13:18.798 --> 13:19.799
HUH?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.031
ALL RIGHT.

13:21.031 --> 13:22.332
OK, GOOD.

13:22.332 --> 13:24.304
I'M TAKIN' THIS.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.306
SOCK, YOU HATE
ALARM CLOCKS!

13:26.306 --> 13:27.407
I KNOW!

13:27.407 --> 13:29.279
YOU'RE MAKING ME CRAZY, SAM!

13:29.279 --> 13:31.281
OK, YOU CANNOT--
YOU CANNOT PUT
6 MILLION BONES

13:31.281 --> 13:34.144
IN FRONT OF THIS MAN'S FACE
AND THEN JUST TAKE IT AWAY.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.246
IT'S NOT RIGHT!

13:41.021 --> 13:43.854
I'M BROKE.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.358
SO I TALKED
TO MY MOM TODAY.

13:48.358 --> 13:50.500
SHE LOVES NEW MEXICO.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.561
THAT'S GREAT.

13:51.561 --> 13:53.533
ALREADY GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.566
I THINK SHE JUST HATES
BEING ALONE.

13:56.566 --> 13:58.608
YOUR PARENTS STILL TOGETHER?

13:58.608 --> 13:59.169
YEAH.

13:59.169 --> 14:01.141
THAT'S GREAT,
HAVING A NORMAL FAMILY.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.874
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T
CALL THEM NORMAL.

14:03.874 --> 14:06.246
BUT THEY'RE HAPPY.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.079
DO YOU EVER
TALK TO YOUR DAD?

14:09.079 --> 14:10.450
NEVER KNEW HIM.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.024
HE WAS A MUSICIAN.
MY MOM MET HIM
ON THE ROAD.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.956
WHAT KIND OF MUSICIAN?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.158
IT'S KINDA FUNNY.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.061
MY MOM WAS A BACKUP SINGER
FOR HUEY LEWIS.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.194
SHE DATED ONE OF
THE BAND MEMBERS
FOR A WHILE,

14:24.194 --> 14:25.635
AND HERE I AM.

14:25.635 --> 14:28.438
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE A PART
OF THE NEWS?

14:28.438 --> 14:30.570
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.602
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

14:32.602 --> 14:33.603
I'M SORRY.

14:33.603 --> 14:36.406
IT'S JUST ALWAYS BEEN
A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ME.

14:36.406 --> 14:39.349
GROWING UP, PEOPLE WOULD
ASK ME ABOUT MY DAD,

14:39.349 --> 14:41.281
AND JUST LOOK AT ME
LIKE I WAS A FREAK.

14:41.281 --> 14:45.015
CADY, YOU'RE NOT
A FREAK.

14:46.416 --> 14:50.260
HEY, HOW ABOUT
REPLACING WALTER?

14:50.260 --> 14:52.492
[LAUGHS] YEAH?

14:52.492 --> 14:53.493
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.595
AND IF YOU WANT
TO THANK ME
BY NAMING IT SAM,

14:55.595 --> 14:58.929
THAT'S TOTALLY COOL.
MM-HMM.

14:58.929 --> 15:00.670
PICK ONE.

15:00.670 --> 15:03.103
HMM.

15:03.573 --> 15:04.904
THAT ONE.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.336
HE LOOKS LONELY.

15:06.336 --> 15:08.508
HE'S ALL YOURS.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.419
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS TV?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.621
WELL, THIS IS A, UH,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.454
FLAT PANELED PLASMA
1080p RESOLUTION,

15:24.454 --> 15:27.227
16 BY 9 WIDESCREEN,
ASPECT-RATIO,

15:27.227 --> 15:30.400
AND AN INCREDIBLE
10,000 TO ONE CONTRAST

15:30.400 --> 15:32.602
FOR AN ARRESTING
VIEWING EXPERIENCE.

15:32.602 --> 15:35.935
IT'S...GOOD.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.169
YOU'RE JUST
READING THE SIGN.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.271
YEAH.

15:41.271 --> 15:43.113
I AM.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.445
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.417
Devil: WHERE DOES
THAT GUY GET OFF?

15:47.417 --> 15:50.280
THEY DON'T PAY YOU
ENOUGH TO TAKE
THAT KIND OF ABUSE.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.253
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
IF YOU'RE HERE TO BUG ME
ABOUT THE SOUL, FORGET IT.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.025
MY JOB IS DONE.
GLADYS WOULDN'T TAKE
THE VESSEL.

15:55.025 --> 15:57.587
THAT'S BECAUSE
THE VESSEL WAS
ONLY HALF-FULL.

15:57.587 --> 15:59.559
OR HALF-EMPTY,
IF YOU'RE CATHOLIC.

15:59.559 --> 16:04.364
NOW THIS IS A SECURITY TAPE
FROM THE FIDELITY CENTRAL BANK.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.438
THIS HAPPENED LAST WEEK
AFTER JOHNSON ESCAPED FROM HELL.

16:08.438 --> 16:12.272
NOW, THIS IS
THE REALLY COOL PART, SAM.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.405
SEE, JOHNSON
HAD A PARTNER.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.407
ALSO ESCAPED FROM HELL.

16:17.407 --> 16:19.209
AND THAT'S HIM,
PAUL HUANG.

16:19.209 --> 16:23.453
[SIGHS] ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M NOT DONE UNTIL
I GET THE SECOND SOUL.

16:23.453 --> 16:24.384
WELL, DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.317
HE HAS THE SAME EXACT POWERS
OF THE GUY YOU JUST CAUGHT.

16:27.317 --> 16:28.688
PIECE OF CAKE.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.362
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT HUANG WAS
THE DANGEROUS ONE.

16:32.362 --> 16:33.463
YOU KNOW,
ONE TIME IN TACOMA,

16:33.463 --> 16:37.067
HE CUT DOWN A WHOLE BANK
FULL OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.328
OH, MY GOD.

16:38.328 --> 16:38.768
HEY.

16:38.768 --> 16:42.272
EASY ON THE "G" WORD, BUDDY.
IT'S RUDE!

16:42.272 --> 16:44.374
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP
BEING A WEENIE

16:44.374 --> 16:45.735
AND SPEND SOME OF THAT CASH?

16:45.735 --> 16:46.676
THAT MONEY'S STOLEN.

16:46.676 --> 16:50.580
14 YEARS AGO, FROM A BANK
THAT HAD INSURANCE.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.382
IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

16:52.382 --> 16:55.315
NOW, THIS NEXT PART,

16:55.315 --> 16:58.788
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO WATCH.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.326
OUCH.

17:06.326 --> 17:10.060
WELL, SO MUCH FOR
A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.532
BETTER GET CRACKING, SAMMY.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.776
GUYS, HEY. I JUST HAD
A VISIT WITH THE DEVIL.

17:26.776 --> 17:29.149
WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM. HE--

17:29.149 --> 17:31.581
ARE YOU WEARING
A TRACK SUIT?

17:33.523 --> 17:35.325
MAYBE.

17:35.325 --> 17:35.785
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT,

17:35.785 --> 17:37.187
OK, ALL RIGHT.
WE BROKE INTO
YOUR ROOM

17:37.187 --> 17:39.329
AND WE TOOK
A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY,

17:39.329 --> 17:40.430
AND WE SPENT IT.

17:40.430 --> 17:41.561
ALL RIGHT,
NOW DON'T YELL.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.433
WHAT DID YOU GUYS BUY?

17:43.433 --> 17:46.065
HEALTH INSURANCE.

17:46.336 --> 17:49.399
PLATINUM BELT BUCKLE.

17:50.300 --> 17:50.770
SOCK!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.302
ALL RIGHT,
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.444
"NO, WE CAN'T
SPEND ANY
OF THE MONEY!"

17:54.444 --> 17:56.476
YEAH, BECAUSE
THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I SOUND.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.449
WELL, SAM,
BOTTOM LINE IS,
THAT IS OUR MONEY.

17:59.449 --> 18:00.380
'KAY?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.381
ALL RIGHT, LET ME
TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.614
THERE WAS THESE GUYS
WHO KNOCKED OFF
A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.

18:04.614 --> 18:08.258
AND FOR A WHILE,
THEY SPENT THE MONEY
AND THEY LIVED THE LIFE,

18:08.258 --> 18:09.289
UNTIL THEY TURNED
ON EACH OTHER

18:09.289 --> 18:11.521
AND THEY KILLED THEMSELVES
OVER IT. IS THAT WHAT WE WANT?

18:11.521 --> 18:13.193
TO KILL OURSELVES OVER...

18:13.193 --> 18:14.524
TRACK SUITS
AND A BELT BUCKLE?

18:14.524 --> 18:15.495
NO, SAM, THAT WON'T
HAPPEN TO US.

18:15.495 --> 18:20.400
THAT'S COOL.
WE DON'T SPEND
ANY MORE MONEY.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.131
THANK YOU.

18:21.131 --> 18:24.534
COME ON, YAHOOTIE.
RIGHT HERE. COME HERE.

18:25.435 --> 18:26.736
BROTHERHOOD. YEAH!

18:26.736 --> 18:28.338
YOU SHOULD KEEP
THAT SUIT, THOUGH.

18:28.338 --> 18:30.380
YOU HAVE NEVER
LOOKED FASTER.

18:30.380 --> 18:31.141
Ben:
THANK YOU.

18:31.141 --> 18:32.642
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WE HAVE MORE WORK
TO DO. COME HERE.

18:32.642 --> 18:35.415
JOHNSON'S PARTNER
GOT OUT OF HELL,
A GUY NAMED HUANG.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.847
WANG?
HUANG. HE'S ROBBING BANKS AGAIN.

18:37.847 --> 18:39.589
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY?

18:39.589 --> 18:40.720
NOTHING.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.322
OK, I'LL CHECK
OLD REPORTS ON
THE BANK ROBBERY

18:42.322 --> 18:45.455
AND SEE IF MAYBE
SOMETHING COMES UP
WITH THIS WANG GUY.

18:45.455 --> 18:47.297
Sam: ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.699
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

18:49.699 --> 18:51.261
UH, SAM?

18:51.261 --> 18:52.332
YEAH?

18:52.332 --> 18:53.763
I KNOW THAT WE JUST
AGREED RIGHT NOW

18:53.763 --> 18:55.705
TO NOT SPEND
ANY MORE OF THE MONEY,

18:55.705 --> 18:57.267
BUT, UM, AHEM...

18:57.267 --> 19:01.811
I BOUGHT MORE
THAN JUST THIS
BELT BUCKLE.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.315
WHAT ELSE?

19:05.315 --> 19:08.618
Sam: OH, MY GOD.
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

19:08.618 --> 19:10.650
WHAT--WHAT IS
ALL THIS?!

19:10.650 --> 19:12.582
OK, OK, OK.

19:12.582 --> 19:14.324
DO YOU REMEMBER
A FEW YEARS BACK

19:14.324 --> 19:15.625
WHEN THERE WAS A FIRE
AT JOSIE'S APARTMENT?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.287
YEAH, RIGHT BEFORE
YOU GUYS BROKE UP.

19:17.287 --> 19:18.788
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
IT WAS AROUND THE TIME

19:18.788 --> 19:22.492
WHEN I WAS EXPLORING
MY FEMININE SIDE?

19:22.492 --> 19:23.333
NO.

19:23.333 --> 19:28.538
WELL, MOSTLY I WAS INTO
JASMINE-SCENTED CANDLES.

19:29.799 --> 19:31.901
DID YOU BURN DOWN
JOSIE'S APARTMENT?

19:31.901 --> 19:33.543
IT'S A DARK PART
OF MY LIFE, SAM.

19:33.543 --> 19:35.905
I'M NOT PROUD
OF IT ANYMORE, OK?

19:35.905 --> 19:37.547
THIS IS EVERYTHING
THAT EITHER BURNT UP

19:37.547 --> 19:39.249
OR MELTED DOWN
IN THE FIRE.

19:39.249 --> 19:41.351
ARE YOU--ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE ME...

19:41.351 --> 19:42.252
TAKE IT ALL BACK?

19:42.252 --> 19:44.354
NO. YOU WERE TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING NICE.

19:44.354 --> 19:45.555
BUT THIS IS WHERE
WE DRAW THE LINE, ALL RIGHT?

19:45.555 --> 19:47.387
THIS IS IT!
ABSOLUTELY.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.489
THIS IS IT.

19:51.321 --> 19:54.364
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH JOSIE?

19:54.364 --> 19:55.525
WHAT? I--

19:55.525 --> 19:59.329
I AM TRYING
TO MAKE AMENDS,
SAM, OK?

19:59.329 --> 20:02.332
AND IF SHE...
CHOOSES TO THANK ME

20:02.332 --> 20:04.234
IN A NAKED
OR PARTIALLY NAKED WAY,

20:04.234 --> 20:06.436
WELL, THAT'S OK,
TOO. I'LL TAKE IT.

20:06.436 --> 20:08.778
GUYS, I FOUND
A LINK TO HUANG.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.810
OH!
YEAH.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.913
THERE WAS A THIRD ROBBER,
AN INSIDE MAN, AT THE BANK.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.486
HOLY CRAP. WE HAVE
TO CAPTURE HIM, TOO?

20:16.486 --> 20:17.347
NOPE, HE'S ALIVE.

20:17.347 --> 20:18.848

40:07.035 --> 40:10.408
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON WITH THAT GUY.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.911
ALL RIGHT,
HE'S BITTER,
CYNICAL, HURTFUL.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.113
YOU, YOU'RE FUNNY.
YOU HAVE A HUGE HEART.

40:15.113 --> 40:20.489
YOU LOVE PEOPLE
AND ANIMALS
AND HUEY LEWIS.

40:20.749 --> 40:26.455
THIS HAND DOES NOT
CONTAIN ONE SCRAP
OF THAT GUY'S DNA.

40:26.455 --> 40:29.758
I'D STAKE MY LIFE
ON THAT.

40:33.201 --> 40:39.738
YOU'RE AN AMAZING,
AWE-INSPIRING BOYFRIEND.
