00:58.468 --> 01:02.257
4x04 - Sorry, Harvey

01:15.145 --> 01:17.063
Oh, it's Ari again.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.768
- All right, I'm gonna take this.
- You want to take it?

01:19.958 --> 01:21.043
Thank you.

01:22.671 --> 01:24.046
Can't you wait for a call back?

01:24.136 --> 01:27.651
As a French might say,
no, I fucking can not.

01:27.795 --> 01:28.795
<i>You know why, Eric?</i>

01:28.842 --> 01:31.333
It's because I have a box
of rare truffles

01:31.413 --> 01:33.171
sitting on  my desk,
a gift from Harvey.

01:33.172 --> 01:34.739
- Do you know why?
-  I can guess.

01:34.859 --> 01:38.776
It's because you sold him on a movie
you're in no position to sell.

01:39.077 --> 01:41.939
Now he thinks we're all travelling
to Cannes together.

01:42.048 --> 01:43.966
Don't worry about it,
it's not your problem.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.135
<i>Not my problem?!</i>

01:45.412 --> 01:47.780
Did you know that Harvey
was a marine, Eric?

01:47.912 --> 01:49.070
A middle class Jew,

01:49.282 --> 01:52.857
who grew up with everything,
yet he chose to join the marines.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.819
<i>- Do you know why?
- No, why?</i>

01:55.010 --> 01:56.626
It's because, and I quote,

01:56.973 --> 02:00.096
he wanted to know
"what it felt like to kill someone."

02:00.227 --> 02:03.383
He will now kill me
when I'll tell him what you did.

02:03.533 --> 02:05.983
Yo, I set a dinner.
I'm telling him tonight, so relax.

02:06.071 --> 02:08.452
- You're gonna tell him in person?
- That's right.

02:09.072 --> 02:10.445
What I wouldn't pay to see that.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.213
Save you're money for botox, Ari.

02:12.318 --> 02:14.256
All that negativity's starting
to take its toll.

02:14.359 --> 02:15.593
Call waiting. Later, loser.

02:15.694 --> 02:18.126
- Lloyd, I see dead people, why?
- I don't know

02:18.196 --> 02:20.160
but M. Night just call
to say he doesn't see you.

02:20.238 --> 02:22.427
Well, I'm at the cemetery
just like he said.

02:22.632 --> 02:24.755
<i>Remind me again
why I put up with this shit?</i>

02:24.881 --> 02:27.540
Because his movies have grossed
almost 2 billion dollars

02:27.621 --> 02:30.623
- and because you're scared of him.
- Thank you, but I fear nothing.

02:33.776 --> 02:36.774
- Little jumpy, Ari?
- We're in a cemetery, Night.

02:36.947 --> 02:38.525
Even for you, this is bizarre.

02:38.819 --> 02:41.218
Don't be an ass.
I'm shooting an IMAX commercial.

02:41.447 --> 02:43.338
Oh, great.
And you want me to star on it?

02:43.428 --> 02:45.456
That's why you've summon me
to the Valley?

02:45.882 --> 02:48.865
No, I finish a new draft of a screenplay
and I don't trust messengers.

02:49.050 --> 02:51.661
You like 6 weeks ahead of schedule.
You bring yourself in it?

02:51.741 --> 02:53.198
I'm gonna improv a little something.

02:53.321 --> 02:55.508
Oh, Indians and improv,
no greater match.

02:58.317 --> 03:00.559
- You gonna read it tonight.
- Of course I will.

03:01.257 --> 03:02.704
Don't tell me you will if you won't.

03:02.810 --> 03:05.283
My night, M. Night,
will be dedicated to nothing

03:05.631 --> 03:07.323
but enjoying your latest creation.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.121
I'm gonna drive by your office
in the morning and I'll pick it up.

03:10.181 --> 03:11.935
- And I'm gonna quizz you.
- As always.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.808
- Alright, Ari.
- See you, Night.

03:15.873 --> 03:17.926
You've got the Misses'
best friends dinner tonight.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.606
Oh, fuck!
Look at this thing, it's 200 pages.

03:21.072 --> 03:24.187
Find me a flashlight, I'm gonna have
to read this at the table.

03:24.314 --> 03:26.507
Why do we have to bring this guy
out with us, Johnny?

03:26.544 --> 03:28.297
'Cause he's the mayor of Beverly Hills.

03:28.368 --> 03:30.611
Then why do you care
if you don't live in Beverly Hills?

03:30.641 --> 03:32.118
I care because the mayor

03:32.138 --> 03:34.638
could use his political clout
to annex my condo in.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.243
How do you like to see this place
rocking a 90210 zip code?

03:38.335 --> 03:40.630
You're 40 feet from the border now,
what's gonna change?

03:40.702 --> 03:43.493
It's like asking what changes
between North and South Corean borders.

03:43.602 --> 03:44.997
Yeah, it's a good analogy.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.426
Turtle, come here.
Look out that window.

03:48.318 --> 03:51.092
You see that brand new fire station
out there? That's Beverly Hills.

03:51.183 --> 03:53.005
Do you know, if they were looking here,

03:53.006 --> 03:55.228
they'd see me burning,
they couldn't do anything about it.

03:55.309 --> 03:58.288
I would have to wait hours
for LA County to come and save me.

03:58.852 --> 04:01.091
I don't wanna wait, Vin.
I wanna be saved.

04:01.756 --> 04:03.282
You are beyond saving, Drama.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.656
- Vince can save me.
- How?

04:05.972 --> 04:08.860
Guy just wants to roll with the big time
celebrity for the evening.

04:08.955 --> 04:11.318
- Have a good time.
- But you're a big time celeb, Johnny.

04:11.424 --> 04:12.599
Why do I have to go?

04:12.947 --> 04:14.947
Well, apparently, he doesn't watch TV.

04:15.607 --> 04:18.730
Look, the annexation vote
is on Wednesday.

04:19.402 --> 04:20.994
He knows what I want and aluded

04:21.113 --> 04:22.892
to the fact
that one hand washes the other.

04:23.632 --> 04:27.321
I need my hands wash, baby Bro.
And you are the soap.

04:27.442 --> 04:29.196
It's Thursday night, Vince.
Fuck his hands.

04:29.197 --> 04:30.197
Shut up, Turtle.

04:30.382 --> 04:32.271
- Is he a good guy, Johnny?
- He's a great guy.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.560
We puff stogies at the Vanmall
all the time.

04:34.626 --> 04:36.133
- Okay, we'll bring him out.
- Yes!

04:36.163 --> 04:37.208
Bring who out where?

04:37.246 --> 04:39.988
We roll with the mayor of Beverly Hills.
Too bad you got to miss it.

04:40.086 --> 04:41.086
Oh, yeah. Too bad.

04:41.211 --> 04:43.364
- Harvey should be fun, though.
- Shut up, Turtle.

04:43.437 --> 04:45.272
Why you can't just
tell Harvey on the phone?

04:45.273 --> 04:48.366
Maybe he loves to feel Harvey
spit me a lobster out of.

04:48.543 --> 04:50.822
No, I just want to be a man
and own up face to face.

04:50.897 --> 04:54.277
You know what? E went out on his own,
against the family on this,

04:54.711 --> 04:56.119
he may have to take a little spit.

04:56.215 --> 04:57.272
Thanks, Vince.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.584
- Little scared of Harvey, huh?
- I'm not afraid of Harvey.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.931
Because, I will go with you,
if you ask nicely.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.015
The mayor, Vince.

05:04.055 --> 05:06.427
No, I got myself into this,
I can get myself out of it.

05:06.487 --> 05:07.666
That's the spirit, kid.

05:07.696 --> 05:10.708
And I'm not afraid of Harvey. I'm trying
to be professionnal and courteous

05:10.709 --> 05:13.499
by doing this but I'm not gonna sit there
while he yells at my face.

05:13.549 --> 05:14.651
You're gonna fight Harvey?

05:14.712 --> 05:16.897
- No, don't fight Harvey, E.
- Harvey's big, E.

05:16.961 --> 05:19.200
Yeah, E, I think Harvey
can definitly take you.

05:20.085 --> 05:21.993
You said that you can take me.
You want to go?

05:22.084 --> 05:23.084
I will fucking...

05:31.919 --> 05:35.153
I'm simply asking you
not to dilly-dally.

05:35.707 --> 05:36.711
That's all.

05:36.772 --> 05:39.729
And I'm not gonna rush their dinner.
This is my best friends engagements.

05:39.779 --> 05:41.459
Come on.
She's been married twice before,

05:41.460 --> 05:43.114
I'm sure we'll get another run of this.

05:43.115 --> 05:45.126
I already stood in the driveway
waiting for you.

05:45.166 --> 05:48.073
Just chew fast and don't order
an appetizer... or dessert.

05:48.178 --> 05:49.242
Give me a break!

05:49.896 --> 05:52.036
Oh, Joyce, you look beautiful.

05:52.147 --> 05:53.992
- Thank you. I'm so excited.
- Me too.

05:54.594 --> 05:55.956
Perfect timing, Ron's at the bar

05:56.021 --> 05:58.726
and we thought we'd get
a before dinner drink. What do you say?

05:59.085 --> 06:00.211
- No?
- No, we're starving.

06:00.212 --> 06:02.144
So, grab your man.
Let's get this thing rolling.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.925
He's kidding, we would love
to have a drink... or two.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.791
Slow down, Turtle.
It's the French country on the right.

06:18.573 --> 06:19.637
Nice house.

06:19.734 --> 06:21.803
He is the mayor of Beverly Hills, bro.

06:22.414 --> 06:23.724
Pull over there, Turtle.

06:25.883 --> 06:28.054
What you're doing?
Let the major know we're here.

06:28.181 --> 06:29.749
You don't honk, you beheaded dog,

06:29.849 --> 06:33.003
You ring the bell like an upstanding
Beverly Hills citizen would do.

06:33.199 --> 06:34.364
Too late.

06:36.644 --> 06:38.050
Don't forget your corsage.

06:41.707 --> 06:42.869
Mayor Lawry!

06:43.454 --> 06:44.659
John Chase...

06:44.958 --> 06:47.712
Is that Vinnie Chase I see in that car?

06:47.773 --> 06:49.447
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm Turtle.

06:49.588 --> 06:52.229
Vinnie, I am a big fan.
Big, big fan.

06:52.319 --> 06:54.767
My kids,
they're just obsessed with Aquaman.

06:54.897 --> 06:57.341
My daughter cried
when they replaced you in the sequel.

06:57.397 --> 07:00.615
Said she will not see it
no matter how good it is.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.763
- Tell her thank you.
- I will. I will.

07:02.877 --> 07:04.128
Ready to go to hell?

07:04.396 --> 07:05.785
Yeah, yeah. Huh...

07:06.397 --> 07:08.666
Got to grab a jacket first.
Walk with me John.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.363
Yeah, this guy's an affair
riding with us.

07:11.690 --> 07:12.905
I really appreciate this.

07:12.961 --> 07:16.843
My wife's been gone for over a year now
and I've been really lonely.

07:17.273 --> 07:19.122
Hey, what are friends for, now?

07:19.212 --> 07:21.775
Yeah, but I think
I'm gonna take my own car.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.754
You sure you don't want
to have Turtle chauffeur?

07:24.854 --> 07:27.324
Then we can get hammered
and have a really good night.

07:27.585 --> 07:30.218
You know what would make it
a really great night, John?

07:30.711 --> 07:33.540
It's if that movie star brother
of yours could help provide me

07:33.649 --> 07:37.245
some comfort of a foxy young thing
I don't have to pay for.

07:38.461 --> 07:39.508
He could do that.

07:54.068 --> 07:56.364
Hi, how are you?
Huh, I'm here to meet Harvey Wei...

07:56.407 --> 07:57.552
- Mr. Murphy?
- Yes.

07:57.592 --> 07:59.099
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

08:05.145 --> 08:06.145
How are you, Eric?

08:06.584 --> 08:07.674
Hey, how are you, Harvey?

08:07.772 --> 08:10.905
Good, good. Great, great.
I'm great. Sit, sit.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.024
Try that wine.

08:19.460 --> 08:20.565
- It's good.
- Good?

08:20.669 --> 08:23.561
That's a '53 Margaux.
It's 33 hundred bucks a bottle.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.896
I only drink it
on celebratory occasions.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.845
This being one,
I ordered two bottles.

08:27.897 --> 08:28.974
Let's celebrate.

08:30.896 --> 08:31.896
Listen, Harvey.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.332
Well, would you look like at this?

08:33.394 --> 08:34.558
See that little cunt?

08:34.832 --> 08:38.272
That prick stole my VP of production.
He's lucky I don't go over there

08:38.381 --> 08:40.429
and crack this fucking bottle
over his head.

08:41.461 --> 08:42.735
I'm not gonna do that, though.

08:42.873 --> 08:44.648
My doctor says I can't do that anymore

08:44.711 --> 08:46.689
'cause my blood pressure
is off the charts.

08:48.648 --> 08:49.648
So...

08:49.896 --> 08:52.228
You and me, E.,
stress free dinner.

08:53.272 --> 08:55.407
- To Medellin.
- Medellin.

08:57.494 --> 08:59.544
I have never been
so embarassed in my life.

08:59.634 --> 09:01.169
What? Wait...
What's so bad?

09:01.270 --> 09:03.843
You got the check
before we got our entrées.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.789
- At least, I paid, right?
- You are such an asshole.

09:06.897 --> 09:08.388
That may be.
But I'm an asshole

09:08.449 --> 09:10.286
that's gonna be home at 9.30
ready to read.

09:10.386 --> 09:11.802
Let's get an early start on this.

09:11.898 --> 09:13.510
Grab my briefcase, you read to me.

09:13.538 --> 09:14.597
Screw you.

09:14.617 --> 09:16.361
Come on, baby, be a team player.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.895
If Night pulls
another half billion dollars gross

09:18.984 --> 09:20.790
out of his hat,
I'll get you some diamonds.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.856
- Briefcase isn't here.
- What do you mean?

09:25.897 --> 09:26.924
Just what I said.

09:27.147 --> 09:29.132
You sure you didn't leave it
in the office?

09:31.270 --> 09:32.743
What, you don't believe me?

09:35.461 --> 09:36.461
Jesus Christ.

09:37.271 --> 09:38.896
The valet probably stole it.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.208
Don't be racist.

09:40.271 --> 09:42.187
Valets steel shit, alright?

09:42.334 --> 09:44.895
Just because they're mostly Hispanic
doesn't make me a racist.

09:44.896 --> 09:46.355
You know what happens if it gets out?

09:46.460 --> 09:48.563
If someone puts Night's new ending
on the Internet?

09:48.649 --> 09:49.716
My life is over!

09:49.833 --> 09:51.231
Nobody's gonna know you did it.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.590
Yes they will. Because Night,
that little sick fuck,

09:53.708 --> 09:55.928
printed my name
on every fucking page.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.438
So maybe the valets put it in the truck.

10:03.210 --> 10:04.631
It's gone, no fucking here.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.221
They fucking stole it.
They motherfukers stole it!

10:08.209 --> 10:09.209
What...

10:09.335 --> 10:10.673
Did they replace it with this?

10:10.744 --> 10:11.858
What the fuck is that?

10:12.584 --> 10:13.584
You tell me, freak.

10:13.797 --> 10:14.931
I have no idea!

10:16.148 --> 10:17.516
Well there's a whole bag!

10:18.291 --> 10:19.938
The seats aren't stuck
as they suppose to be.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.521
- What?
- They gave us the wrong car.

10:21.522 --> 10:23.004
- Shut up.
- Get in there.

10:23.065 --> 10:24.240
What are you, fucking blind?

10:24.329 --> 10:26.032
You're the one
who drive it home, shmuck!

10:26.072 --> 10:27.664
Why would I buy a black cock?

10:33.648 --> 10:35.101
Where the fuck are our salads?

10:36.022 --> 10:37.943
Hey, pal. Pal!

10:41.020 --> 10:43.072
How long we got to wait
for our lousy icebergwich?

10:43.141 --> 10:44.258
You slice the fucking thing,

10:44.318 --> 10:46.350
you put it on a plate
and you bring it over here!

10:48.399 --> 10:50.298
Anyway, E,
what was I talking about?

10:51.021 --> 10:52.599
You're saying that you, huh...

10:52.897 --> 10:55.546
you were pissed off on us
after we fucked you over in Sundance.

10:55.968 --> 10:57.423
Yeah, I was raging.

10:57.711 --> 10:59.918
Sure, you little pricks
make me call a press conference

10:59.958 --> 11:02.368
to annonce I'm in business with you
and then you bail on me?

11:02.461 --> 11:03.724
I know, that was, huh...

11:04.398 --> 11:05.796
that was a big mistake, Harvey.

11:05.933 --> 11:06.960
It was a mistake?

11:08.462 --> 11:09.619
That was some mistake.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.973
Don't you ever make a mistake
like that with me again.

11:13.146 --> 11:15.546
Because next time,
I'm not gonna be so kind.

11:16.587 --> 11:17.587
I killed people.

11:18.450 --> 11:19.966
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

11:20.086 --> 11:21.086
Sure, go ahead.

11:23.488 --> 11:25.675
On your way over there,
walk by that cunt's table

11:25.779 --> 11:27.577
and give him
a little elbow on the head.

11:29.362 --> 11:30.414
If you feel like it.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.111
How am I gonna get
this guy a laid, Johnny?

11:39.175 --> 11:40.199
Seriously.

11:40.424 --> 11:43.267
Tell girls if they fuck him,
you'll fuck 'em after.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.497
That sounds like
a good deal for Vince.

11:45.577 --> 11:46.651
He'd be lying.

11:47.843 --> 11:49.098
Oh, Jesus.

11:49.592 --> 11:50.928
How did he beat us here?

12:00.286 --> 12:01.391
What's up, Vince?

12:04.798 --> 12:05.949
<i>How is it going over there?</i>

12:06.048 --> 12:07.155
It's not.
This guy is nuts.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.333
He's tittering on the edge.

12:08.739 --> 12:09.791
Did he yell at you?

12:09.864 --> 12:11.547
He didn't,
because I didn't tell him yet.

12:11.548 --> 12:13.465
I thought you said
you're not afraid of Harvey.

12:13.555 --> 12:15.338
I ain't,
but it wouldn't be good for anybody

12:15.370 --> 12:16.818
if I ended up rolling on the parking lot

12:16.878 --> 12:18.899
with one of the most powerful men
in Hollywood.

12:19.048 --> 12:20.240
So what you want me to do?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.297
I want you to come down here.

12:21.298 --> 12:23.174
<i>- I'm with the mayor, E.
- Fuck the mayor.</i>

12:23.264 --> 12:25.864
Harvey's not gonna make the same kind
of scene if you're here.

12:25.935 --> 12:27.030
Swallow your pride,

12:27.070 --> 12:29.293
admit you're afraid of him
and I'm there.

12:29.603 --> 12:30.999
I'm not scared of Harvey.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.565
How long you think you can keep me
waiting at the table

12:33.566 --> 12:34.755
without me getting antsy?

12:34.796 --> 12:37.146
Sorry about that.
I'm actually talking to Vince right now.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.284
Hey, Vince.
How the fuck are you?

12:40.451 --> 12:41.486
Hey, Harvey.

12:41.669 --> 12:42.814
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

12:42.995 --> 12:44.871
I just walked in a place
called Winston's

12:44.991 --> 12:46.008
I love Winston's.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.928
We'll come over there
for a celebratory toast.

12:48.531 --> 12:51.206
Walk the other way, David,
or I'll pull out your fuckin' eyeballs.

12:51.249 --> 12:53.049
- Yeah, we see you soon.
- See you.

12:53.804 --> 12:54.804
Come on, eat!

12:58.065 --> 12:59.822
Nel really likes this one over here.

13:00.555 --> 13:01.923
Could you go talk to her?

13:08.182 --> 13:10.341
It's a black LS Hybrid.

13:10.548 --> 13:13.229
So don't be afraid to step on the gas
and get it up here.

13:13.491 --> 13:15.062
But, sir, this is a black LS.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.393
That's the wrong black LS, obviously.

13:19.242 --> 13:21.136
Okay, do you... is there a manager?

13:23.142 --> 13:24.179
I am the manager.

13:24.492 --> 13:25.847
An English speaking manager?

13:25.928 --> 13:28.556
- I speak English.
- First language English speaking?

13:28.697 --> 13:30.605
It's okay.
You switched cars on us.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.396
Oh shit, that's not your car.

13:33.974 --> 13:37.587
The guy who just left with the same car,
accused us of stealing his glasses.

13:37.830 --> 13:38.867
Here they are.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.380
Wrongfully accuse again.

13:40.679 --> 13:41.776
So, he's gone?

13:42.118 --> 13:44.660
Yeah, but I'm sure he gonna
come back as soon as he realizes.

13:44.750 --> 13:45.863
I don't have time to wait.

13:45.923 --> 13:47.960
I have something I need
to get off the car tonight.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.178
There's nothing you can do...

13:49.179 --> 13:51.320
There's always something
that can be done, baby.

13:51.384 --> 13:53.844
Sometimes, you just have to think
really, really hard.

13:54.178 --> 13:55.406
So everybody think.

13:59.180 --> 14:01.078
And do we got something?
You got something?

14:01.928 --> 14:04.718
You could always go to his house
and hope that he's home.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.126
What, you know where he lives?

14:06.850 --> 14:08.610
But it never occurs to you, rich people,

14:08.716 --> 14:11.152
that when you are enjoying
a nice dinner, we have your keys

14:11.212 --> 14:12.703
and your fancy navigation system

14:12.944 --> 14:14.681
to lead you straight
to your empty house?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.266
I like your style, Pal.

14:24.409 --> 14:25.654
Oxnard. How far is that?

14:25.764 --> 14:27.070
About 50 miles.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.540
You're taking me home first.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.430
Thank you, sir.

14:33.270 --> 14:34.997
5-5-3-2

14:36.911 --> 14:38.799
Cool, so I call you at like... 2.00?

14:38.852 --> 14:39.867
Huh, make it 2.30,

14:39.868 --> 14:41.866
the boys and I usually grab
a bite late night.

14:45.531 --> 14:47.750
Thought you're supposed to phone
for the mayor, not ourselves.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.148
I'm just not a good wrangler.

14:49.178 --> 14:51.883
Yeah but I am, and I've been wasting
my skills on Drama's cause.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.781
You're telling me you'd be
poll in it if it was for your cause?

14:54.953 --> 14:57.604
Of course I would be.
What kind of question is that?

14:58.122 --> 15:00.632
Fellas, guess who's into politics?

15:00.853 --> 15:01.934
This is Enika.

15:01.994 --> 15:02.931
Anika.

15:03.932 --> 15:06.299
- Anika, the boys.
- Hello, boys.

15:06.431 --> 15:07.761
Anika is from Prague.

15:07.868 --> 15:10.751
I told her a little about our man
and she's very impressed.

15:11.056 --> 15:12.697
Gotta love the eastern block.

15:12.888 --> 15:14.495
Back in a flash.

15:17.991 --> 15:21.047
Nel, say hello to Anika.

15:21.431 --> 15:25.137
Anika, the one and only mayor
of Beverly Hills, Nel Lawry.

15:25.243 --> 15:28.979
Johnny has told me of your dedication
to the city and of your kindness.

15:29.119 --> 15:30.487
It is so nice to meet you.

15:30.619 --> 15:31.827
You too. You too.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.829
Would you like to sit?

15:34.055 --> 15:35.516
Yes, I would love to.

15:41.189 --> 15:43.489
My God, you have gorgeous feet.

15:45.854 --> 15:46.931
How about that.

15:48.582 --> 15:49.619
How about this?

15:52.367 --> 15:53.763
He looks like a P.O.W.
(ny: POW = prisoner of war)

16:13.877 --> 16:16.233
- Who is it?
- Hi. My name is Ari Gold.

16:16.436 --> 16:18.108
- I think you have my car.
- What?

16:18.632 --> 16:21.112
- What are you talking about?
- Will you open the door?

16:21.339 --> 16:23.445
No! And I have a dog!

16:23.659 --> 16:25.872
That's great.
I think you also have my car.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.858
Do you drive a black Lexus?

16:28.232 --> 16:29.938
My husband does.

16:30.125 --> 16:34.072
Well, I think the valet gave him
the wrong car, 'cause I'm driving his.

16:34.525 --> 16:37.497
- Valet? What valet?
- The valet at Morton's tonight.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.437
- Morton's in LA?
- Yeah.

16:42.677 --> 16:45.930
What was my husband doing
at Morton's in LA tonight?

16:53.595 --> 16:56.494
What the fuck were you doing
at Morton's tonight?

16:56.686 --> 16:59.011
- What?
- The valet switched our cars.

16:59.267 --> 17:01.931
- What?
- Answer me! Who the fuck were you with?

17:01.932 --> 17:04.279
See? That's my briefcase!
Thank you God!

17:04.385 --> 17:06.464
Answer me, you piece of shit!

17:06.545 --> 17:07.585
- What?
- Listen,

17:08.031 --> 17:09.433
here are your keys. Can I get mine?

17:09.577 --> 17:12.589
I am fucking waiting
for a fucking answer!

17:12.775 --> 17:14.164
Good night to your dog, pal.

17:17.605 --> 17:18.722
I'll tell you what,

17:19.268 --> 17:22.265
Just admit that you're scared of him
and I'll apologize for you.

17:22.441 --> 17:25.483
I don't need you to apologize. I just
want you to be here when he goes down.

17:25.563 --> 17:27.215
I'm right here!
What are you waiting for?

17:27.376 --> 17:28.383
The right moment!

17:29.425 --> 17:32.009
Buy the chuck,
we're they real Winstons or what?

17:32.199 --> 17:33.684
Yeah, only mine is the good looks,

17:33.804 --> 17:35.560
ten in a buttonny five hundred, suit.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.322
I got one of those suits, bro.

17:37.829 --> 17:38.815
Yo, Ben!

17:39.469 --> 17:40.482
Yo, Ray!

17:40.882 --> 17:42.268
This is delicate.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.562
- What's that?
- You know, the boy you came in with?

17:44.775 --> 17:46.028
Yeah. What about him?

17:46.228 --> 17:47.988
He's about to suck face with a tranny.

17:48.163 --> 17:49.214
What? Come on...

17:49.708 --> 17:51.868
That's no tranny, Ray! That's Anika!

17:51.961 --> 17:53.730
Anika's got a bigger stump
than you do, Drama

17:55.465 --> 17:57.958
If you John had knew that,
he would have kept her for himself!

17:58.041 --> 17:59.138
Ray, are you sure?

17:59.535 --> 18:01.895
Trust me. The only reason we let
that he/she in here

18:01.948 --> 18:03.815
is cause she goes on Howard Stern.

18:03.963 --> 18:06.629
We don't need a bad ink. I'm sorry bro.

18:07.563 --> 18:09.456
- I can't believe it!
- Believe it, Drama.

18:10.043 --> 18:12.043
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
- No doubt, man.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.566
What do we do?

18:15.019 --> 18:16.432
I ain't saying shit.

18:16.658 --> 18:18.951
Nobody's saying nothing until I'm 90210.

18:19.191 --> 18:20.604
Johnny, you'll find out eventually

18:20.791 --> 18:22.551
that you'd better pray
he's not your mayor.

18:22.738 --> 18:23.938
Do the right thing!

18:25.951 --> 18:27.471
- Fine, I'll tell him.
- E.?

18:29.284 --> 18:30.297
I'm going.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.217
A couple of shots, first, to relax?

18:32.590 --> 18:33.603
Definitely!

18:47.858 --> 18:48.894
Yeah, Lloyd?

18:49.027 --> 18:50.636
<i>Just make sure you're up and reading.</i>

18:50.721 --> 18:52.987
<i>Well, I'm up
and I'm not fucking reading!</i>

18:53.307 --> 18:54.627
You're even angry in the evening?

18:54.794 --> 18:55.820
Fuck off, Lloyd!

18:56.247 --> 18:57.548
Good night, Ari.

18:58.114 --> 19:00.180
- Yes, alright.
- Talk to me while I drive

19:00.287 --> 19:02.107
<i>- so I don't fall asleep.
- Okay, Ari.</i>

19:03.120 --> 19:04.773
Oh, fuck!

19:05.333 --> 19:07.261
- What?
- I'm getting pulled over.

19:07.524 --> 19:08.804
<i>How fast are you going?</i>

19:08.937 --> 19:10.031
225.

19:10.244 --> 19:11.270
That's not good...

19:16.871 --> 19:17.885
Cheers!

19:21.271 --> 19:22.418
I'm going in.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.245
And E., why aren't your feet moving?

19:26.151 --> 19:27.551
Alright. I'm scared of him.

19:28.985 --> 19:31.321
We'll see...
Come on. I'll talk to him.

19:31.748 --> 19:33.241
I'll stand right next to you.

19:33.427 --> 19:35.620
We'll all be hanging back, having fun.

19:37.163 --> 19:38.176
Hi.

19:40.549 --> 19:41.562
Or not...

19:47.695 --> 19:49.615
Anika, would you excuse us for a second?

19:49.829 --> 19:51.455
Yeah, sure.

19:51.855 --> 19:54.681
You'd better hurry back,
or I'm gonna come chasing.

19:56.443 --> 19:57.623
I will.

20:01.227 --> 20:02.454
Hey, John, what's happening?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.107
- It's about Anika.
- Yeah?

20:07.320 --> 20:09.747
You know, we didn't even need
Vinny central, huh?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.066
Thank you.

20:12.973 --> 20:15.373
I tell you, she is one doll...

20:16.653 --> 20:19.840
Yeah, well, according to some,
that Barbie might be a Ken.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.400
She might have balls, Your Honor.

20:22.746 --> 20:23.758
What?

20:23.919 --> 20:27.252
She's a he, transformer, hermaphrodite,
something that just ain't right.

20:27.705 --> 20:31.012
I don't believe that. Look at her!
She's beautiful.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.491
I got only reasons to lie to you now.

20:35.944 --> 20:36.962
It's true!

20:37.949 --> 20:40.364
- I'm sorry.
- I am too!

20:42.390 --> 20:44.097
I appreciate your honesty.

20:48.858 --> 20:52.618
And I would appreciate
your palsy's discretion

20:52.725 --> 20:55.178
cause I don't care
what she's got under that dress.

20:56.698 --> 20:59.272
We have a connection. She gets me!

21:01.692 --> 21:03.985
Hey, babe,
you're ready to get out of here?

21:05.120 --> 21:08.098
I got a blue Mercedes tainted windows
see out there in ten minutes.

21:13.866 --> 21:15.268
What about my annexation?

21:16.159 --> 21:17.851
Looking good!

21:20.389 --> 21:21.769
Sweet.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.999
I love you.
Sit down.

21:29.292 --> 21:31.274
So... So, what's on your mind?

21:32.699 --> 21:34.267
<i>- It's about Medellin.
- What about it?</i>

21:34.347 --> 21:35.866
- We...
- Vodkas, fresh cranberry.

21:36.088 --> 21:38.738
- I ordered tonic.
- No, you didn't, you ordered cranberry.

21:39.038 --> 21:41.353
Why would I ordered cranberry
if I don't drink cranberry?

21:41.475 --> 21:42.855
I don't know, but you did.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.570
You believe this fucking guy?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.186
I'll give you a tonic.

21:47.742 --> 21:50.258
Don't give me a tonic.
Tell me I didn't ordered cranberry.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.796
- But, you did.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:52.907 --> 21:54.109
Just get the tonic guy.

21:56.213 --> 21:57.571
Don't go anywhere.

21:59.931 --> 22:00.977
What are you doing?

22:01.068 --> 22:03.272
I'm not telling him.
He's out of his mind.

22:03.473 --> 22:05.142
You know what?
I'll do it.

22:08.215 --> 22:09.595
Harvey, look.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.354
You look me in the fucking face.

22:11.465 --> 22:14.863
You tell me why,
that after fifty years of life,

22:14.997 --> 22:17.690
and never having even sipped
cranberry juice,

22:17.895 --> 22:21.501
for some reason, I come in here
and I order cranberry juice?

22:21.724 --> 22:23.950
Can you answer that,
you fucking scumbag?

22:24.106 --> 22:26.154
No, I can't, but you did.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.469
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

22:28.603 --> 22:30.685
- Take it easy, sir.
- Don't tell me to take it easy!

22:30.752 --> 22:32.043
You know who the fuck I am?

22:32.176 --> 22:34.958
I was rolling my balls when
you were sucking your mother's titty!

22:35.025 --> 22:36.851
- Let's leave my mother out of this.
- Fuck you!

22:37.073 --> 22:38.943
- Fuck him!
- Alright pal, you out of here.

22:39.144 --> 22:40.212
Come on!

22:40.235 --> 22:42.172
Get your fucking hands off me!

22:42.974 --> 22:44.956
So you let Vince do your dirty work,
huh, E?

22:45.557 --> 22:46.625
Nah, he couldn't do it.

22:46.803 --> 22:48.673
Hey, E, had him, after all.

22:48.862 --> 22:51.322
Nah, I didn't get a chance too either.
But I'll try tomorrow.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.502
Tomorrow?

22:52.614 --> 22:54.951
What?
You weak, weak man.

22:55.085 --> 22:56.187
Hey, Harvey!

22:56.921 --> 22:58.346
We're not selling you the movie.

22:58.602 --> 23:01.029
Sorry bro, we're putting it
on the open market in Cannes.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.077
You're gonna have
to bid like everyone else.

23:03.700 --> 23:04.992
I'll eat you alive.

23:05.359 --> 23:07.919
I'll eat you alive,
and trifle you out of my tooth !

23:08.209 --> 23:09.836
After what you've done this time.

23:09.970 --> 23:11.350
You'll never work again!

23:11.528 --> 23:14.512
Never! You understand me?
Your career is over!

23:16.805 --> 23:18.809
He was talking about E, not me, right?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.797
Morning, Ari.

23:26.558 --> 23:28.028
Done.
Night in me office?

23:28.139 --> 23:30.036
- Yes sir, he just got here.
- Perfect timing.

23:30.122 --> 23:31.992
Are your wearing
the same suit as yesterday?

23:32.081 --> 23:33.373
I spent the night in jail.

23:33.506 --> 23:34.920
Oh my God!
Why didn't you call me?

23:34.942 --> 23:38.081
You get one call, and I wanted to use it
on someone I like to have sex with.

23:38.481 --> 23:39.817
Genius.
Best script yet.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.621
Ask me anything.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.866
How could you
possibly like that third act?

23:45.293 --> 23:47.426
Are you kidding?
The twist with the dove? I loved it.

23:47.449 --> 23:49.052
- It was perfect.
- No, it's fucked!

23:49.207 --> 23:50.877
What you read is totally fucked!

23:51.211 --> 23:53.570
I tried to call you last night.
You didn't have your cell.

23:53.749 --> 23:54.750
I dont' understand.

23:54.839 --> 23:57.155
After you left, it hit me.
The all 3rd act is a mess, man.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.390
It's a mess!

23:58.858 --> 24:01.051
I changed it.
It really works, now.

24:03.566 --> 24:04.813
You read it.

24:06.853 --> 24:08.077
I'll wait.

24:09.636 --> 24:11.350
Start from the top scene, get the flow.

24:24.757 --> 24:26.182
Morning, fellas.

24:27.505 --> 24:30.266
- Get them while they're hot.
- You just saved E's ass.

24:30.377 --> 24:32.492
He's been wresling
with your expresso maker for an hour.

24:32.693 --> 24:35.431
Wrestle no more, E.
I got your favourite caramel macchiato.

24:35.564 --> 24:37.880
I hate caramel, but very thoughtful,
nonetheless.

24:38.047 --> 24:39.093
Indeed, it was.

24:39.138 --> 24:40.802
But even more thoughtful,
were the coffees

24:40.829 --> 24:42.682
I brought over
to the Beverly Hills firehouse

24:42.735 --> 24:44.269
when I went over to introduce myself.

24:44.469 --> 24:45.668
You're expecting a fire,

24:45.732 --> 24:47.908
or you just hoping to slide up
and down on their pole?

24:49.701 --> 24:51.037
You slay me!

24:51.572 --> 24:53.486
No, really, I'm just proud to be a...

24:53.553 --> 24:55.233
soon to be annexed resident

24:55.289 --> 24:57.876
of the queen city known
throughout the world as Beverly Hills.

24:58.518 --> 25:01.011
Yeah, I wouldn't be too proud
too fast, Drama.

25:01.212 --> 25:03.215
How much longer your boy
is gonna be mayor?

25:03.371 --> 25:04.696
What are you talking about?

25:04.905 --> 25:08.879
I'm talking about the all seeing,
all knowing lenses of TMZ.com.

25:09.332 --> 25:10.648
Look at this.

25:13.144 --> 25:16.366
Hey, mayor, I'm from TMZ,
how about saying a little something?

25:17.188 --> 25:18.611
Howdy folks!

25:19.417 --> 25:21.027
Why are you sneaking out the alley?

25:21.591 --> 25:24.168
I'm not sneaking.
There's no sneaking going on here.

25:24.276 --> 25:25.940
Fast in the car, babe.

25:34.147 --> 25:35.490
That's nuts.
