00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
A feature of the KonMari Method

00:45.336 --> 00:48.256
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:51.718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:02.705 --> 02:06.668
The tidying process
provides a unique opportunity

02:06.751 --> 02:09.796
to understand what is
most important in one's life.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.590
In this episode,
you will meet Aaron and Sehnita.

02:12.674 --> 02:18.263
Join me as I help this family create
an ideal home for their desired future.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.151
<i>Dada, could we go to Toys R Us?</i>

02:31.234 --> 02:33.945
No, Ashton. We're getting rid of things
not going out and getting more.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.364
<i>And being happy with</i>
<i>how much we already have.</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:38.158
- Okay.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.910
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.579
-I'm Marie.
-Nice to meet you.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.080
Hi, very nice to meet you. Aaron.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.249
I have to try.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.336
Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.797
Hi, Iida. Miss Marie's interpreter.
Nice to meet you.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.133
And Natalia is two-and-a-half years old.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.302
She's asleep.
She's taking a nap right now.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.345
-Oh, wow.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.599
-My daughter is same, two years old.
-Oh, really?

03:02.682 --> 03:03.725
And one years old.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.727
-You have a two- and a one-year-old?
-Yes.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.061
And you're organized?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.148
We have no excuse. Alright.

03:10.648 --> 03:11.900
We have no excuse.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.987
I'm Sehnita.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.071
I'm Aaron.
We're the Mattisons.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.200
<i>We've been married 17 years.</i>

03:20.283 --> 03:23.161
We met at the
University of Michigan junior year.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.746
-I think we just--
-End of junior year,

03:24.829 --> 03:25.705
start of senior year.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.749
Started dating senior year,

03:27.832 --> 03:30.210
we basically decided we want
a change of venue,

03:30.293 --> 03:32.045
<i>the weather, time to get</i>
<i>some better weather.</i>

03:32.128 --> 03:34.339
<i>We drove out to Los Angeles</i>
<i>and set up here.</i>

03:34.422 --> 03:35.590
What's going on, guys?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.760
We live with our two children.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.429
We have a
seven-and-a-half-year-old boy, Ashton

03:41.512 --> 03:44.224
<i>and an almost three-year-old Natalia.</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:47.268
We're here and we love it,

03:47.352 --> 03:48.937
and we planning on being here
a long time.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.064
<i>There's a thought, though,</i>
<i>as our lives,</i>

03:51.147 --> 03:53.024
<i>we have so much love to give,</i>

03:53.107 --> 03:56.444
<i>we live in a wonderful home, we're part</i>
<i>of a wonderful school district.</i>

03:56.527 --> 04:01.282
<i>We have a lot of opportunity to bring</i>
<i>another baby into this house,</i>

04:01.366 --> 04:04.452
but the clutter, it just feels heavy.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.704
It's just, you know, and overwhelming.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.999
<i>We have a major amount of cleaning</i>
<i>that we need to undertake</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:11.292
<i>before we move forward.</i>

04:14.671 --> 04:17.006
This, yeah, this is the room
we use the most.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.967
Like, the kitchen, the living room.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.387
Definitely a lot of time spent watching TV
or, you know, playing.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.266
Okay, so I see part of the problem.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.394
Yeah, you're also seeing
part of the problem.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.814
<i>You know, we've been</i>
<i>in our house for seven years.</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:36.192
<i>But it's a never ending battle</i>
<i>to fight the clutter.</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:37.735
<i>We have things,</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:40.655
and those things end up taking
a space in our house and it's--

04:40.738 --> 04:42.448
They get spread around,

04:42.532 --> 04:45.368
<i>just multiplies, and pretty soon</i>
<i>our house is a chaotic mess.</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:47.662
If we have a space that opens up,

04:47.745 --> 04:49.372
pretty soon it'll get filled up.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.793
-You fill up space, too.
-I do, I do.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.086
It's gotta go somewhere.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.255
And, look, there's an open spot!
How about there?

04:57.338 --> 04:58.840
Yes.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.594
<i>I feel like the clutter</i>
<i>is just-- it's like a big block now.</i>

05:03.928 --> 05:07.765
<i>But added to it is</i>
<i>it's so stressful to clean the house.</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:10.601
<i>It's hard to think about</i>
<i>doing anything else</i>

05:10.685 --> 05:12.770
<i>'cause it always feels like,</i>
<i>"No, I gotta go clean."</i>

05:12.854 --> 05:15.440
<i>So even when I'm relaxing,</i>
<i>I should be cleaning.</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:18.067
-We have a fish on our table.
-We have a fish.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.652
I don't why. But there it is.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.281
This is Natalia.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.825
This is Miss Marie and Miss Iida.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.493
-Can you say hi?
- Hi.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.704
Hello.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.290
-No. She'll just sit here for a while.
- Not yet, not yet.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.250
Well, this is Ashton's room in here.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.168
Okay.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.672
This is his nice, big closet.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.092
-So these are his--
-Clothes. Oh, pajamas?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.137
His pajamas, his, uh, shirts.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.432
Aaron wandered in here and realized that

05:49.515 --> 05:52.435
I have taken over these three drawers.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.103
They're awaiting your magic.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.521
What is that?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.900
So, I was born in Pakistan.

05:58.983 --> 06:03.529
So if we have Pakistani occasions,
I have my shawls to take.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.073
When's the last time you wore them?

06:05.490 --> 06:09.327
You know, I feel such a disconnect
to my culture to begin with.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.872
<i>I don't have a big</i>
<i>Indian-Pakistani community</i>

06:12.955 --> 06:15.124
<i>being here in Los Angeles.</i>

06:15.249 --> 06:16.417
So...

06:17.251 --> 06:22.256
you know, that's a little piece of
connection that I would like to hold onto.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.758
This is our master.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.885
We have lots of mess.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.970
This one is Aaron's closet.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.306
Yeah, these are more like
my dress shirts, I go to work.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.349
-Um...

06:31.432 --> 06:34.519
- Sehnita's clothes.
- And some books?

06:34.602 --> 06:36.854
This might be my little problem.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.065
I have a hard time
letting go of magazines.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.901
This whole pile was in our bathroom.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.445
I'd kind of hidden it from downstairs,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.447
brought it upstairs, hidden it up there.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.993
Do you have any magazines
left in the bathroom right now?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.955
Not in the bathroom.
I might have piles elsewhere.

06:54.372 --> 06:58.459
I do think that Sehnita has a tendency
to hold onto more things.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.379
<i>That's why working with Marie</i>
<i>would be very helpful.</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:04.132
<i>I can't do it by myself.</i>
<i>I can't make her do it.</i>

07:04.215 --> 07:05.967
-Those are mine. Close that door.
-Wait, okay.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.885
-Let me go to--
-Go ahead and close that door.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.762
No. Those aren't-- No.

07:09.846 --> 07:10.763
You can close those.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.974
-Let me try the next one.
-You can't throw those things.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.602
I understand that I either hold onto
things or I'm sentimental about things.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.355
<i>But we're not dying in here, like,</i>

07:19.439 --> 07:23.860
they don't have to, like, airlift me out
of this house 'cause there's no path out.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.279
I'm workable!

07:27.655 --> 07:29.907
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this closet. It's huge!

07:32.910 --> 07:35.705
Okay, so all of your dresses here. I see.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.875
So, half of these dresses
I can't wear right now, but...

07:39.584 --> 07:42.086
I don't want to give up
on getting to my goal weight,
so I don't want to let go of these yet.

07:44.755 --> 07:48.301
These shorts don't fit me,
but I can't get rid of them.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.343
Look at these shoes.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.221
These are another one of those pairs
that I can't get rid of.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.973
I don't think I've ever
seen her wear them.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.435
These are maternity clothes.

07:57.518 --> 08:02.023
We were-- part of our goal
of wanting to clear our house is

08:02.106 --> 08:04.275
we would like to add a third baby.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.028
And it feels like
if we can't get our house clean,

08:07.320 --> 08:09.655
you know, maybe we shouldn't
go down that path.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.659
I just know that if we have
this much junk right now,

08:13.743 --> 08:17.079
like, if we were to have a third,
it would only get worse from here.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.086
-Welcome.
-Here it is.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.590
I think some of the things
that we need a little help with

08:27.673 --> 08:30.218
-in the garage are clothes.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.137
All these clothes you've kept,
you never let any of them go?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.972
Not any of Ashton's clothes,

08:35.056 --> 08:36.265
not any of Natalia's clothes.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.434
These are just suitcases.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.021
And these suitcases
have suitcases in them.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.690
So I think we need help
minimizing a little.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.236
I feel like-- You know, he's saying
we should get rid of them,

08:48.319 --> 08:50.071
I think we need to take more family trips.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.656
- Not all.
-To make use of them.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.741
Trivial Pursuit.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.076
-Two of two.
-We need them both.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.036
Whole different experience.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.163
We actually have three. One's inside.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.125
And we also have kids toys over there.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.713
So your kids,
they don't play with those toys?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.298
- No.
- Not right now.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.177
If we can get
this whole garage organized more,

09:13.261 --> 09:16.472
then they'll be in a place
where they can access them easier.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.891
Once you do your magic.

09:19.976 --> 09:24.313
I want to clean up my stuff,
but I feel like I'm not getting there.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.232
So, for me...

09:26.816 --> 09:30.278
what I've really wrapped
my head around in my life is

09:30.361 --> 09:32.363
<i>if I'm not doing the things</i>
<i>that I need to do,</i>

09:32.446 --> 09:34.699
<i>then, you know, go seek out experts</i>

09:35.199 --> 09:37.326
that can help you make
the change that you need.

09:40.037 --> 09:43.791
This KonMari Method is not
a simple method to clean your house.

09:43.874 --> 09:44.959
Mm-hmm.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.588
You mentioned my magic.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.507
I'm sorry to say that
I don't use any magic.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.175
Only you can do that.

09:55.636 --> 09:59.432
But at the same time, I have seen
many of my clients transform their lives

09:59.515 --> 10:01.017
because in their heart of hearts,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.102
they were ready to prepare
to change their life.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.230
I want to, she wants to,
we want to put in the hard work.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.691
And that's where I think
we're just looking for the guidance.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.234
Thank you so much.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.820
I'm so honored and thankful
to hear you say that.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.281
<i>We're ready to declutter the home because</i>

10:15.364 --> 10:19.619
we foresee staying here for, you know,
the next 20 years maybe.

10:19.702 --> 10:24.165
So, there's nothing that is going to
force us to go through our stuff,

10:24.248 --> 10:26.125
except for something like this.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.086
<i>I'm so excited. </i>

10:38.179 --> 10:39.972
-Good morning!
- Hi! Good morning!
Good to see you. Good morning.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.060
-Hi. Good morning.
-Hi, good morning.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.897
- There's Natalia to greet you.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.108
She had a slight run-in
with the dog this morning

10:51.192 --> 10:52.902
so she's recovering.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.321
-Do you want to go to the other room?
-Yes.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.492
So today, we'll tackle clothes.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.501
Oh, my gosh.
This mountain of things.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.716
So from here, you're gonna be
going through every single piece,

11:15.800 --> 11:16.967
piece by piece.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.763
I feel very overwhelmed.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.390
It does feel overwhelming.
-Let's breathe.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.185
Let's take a deep breath of air.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.481
-Stretch.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.657
When you feel stuck while tidying,

11:40.032 --> 11:41.200
try and change the air.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.454
Simply opening the windows
will be effective,

11:45.663 --> 11:47.331
but there are other ways as well.

11:50.459 --> 11:54.046
<i>Create a sound that has a great vibration.</i>

11:55.464 --> 11:56.590
Light a candle.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.469
<i>Spray an aromatic room spray.</i>

12:01.220 --> 12:02.847
<i>Lighting some incense...</i>

12:05.349 --> 12:06.767
<i>is also an option.</i>

12:07.852 --> 12:11.105
<i>By creating smoke, it'll purify the room.</i>

12:12.648 --> 12:17.862
Of course, you can do these every day
and not just when tidying.

12:18.529 --> 12:24.201
I use these methods
to purify my home every day.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.415
So my advice is go with something that's
very easy for you to make a decision on,

12:29.498 --> 12:31.167
something that you'd know right away.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.921
You know, it's like...

12:36.380 --> 12:39.383
it's hard to understand
my feelings because,

12:39.467 --> 12:43.679
you know, there's some things where I'm
like, "No, this doesn't spark joy in me."

12:44.472 --> 12:46.807
It fits me and that's--
and so it's practical,

12:46.891 --> 12:48.601
so I'm glad it fits me.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.812
But, no I'm not happy I have to wear you.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.485
But I do understand
because of my height.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.320
You have no idea what a nightmare it is

12:59.403 --> 13:02.948
for me to find clothes that fit me
because I'm so short, in that sense.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.366
And small.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.286
But, in a sense, I will just recommend

13:07.369 --> 13:10.498
picking out clothes that fit you right now
that you're comfortable with

13:10.790 --> 13:11.999
and decide from there.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.044
-This I wear.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.799
This I wear.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.343
-And it sparks joy for you?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.597
-Yeah.
-Okay.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.268
Instead of just basing it on
whether you wear it or not,

13:31.352 --> 13:33.145
think about,
"Do I really need this piece?"

13:33.229 --> 13:34.563
"Is it necessary for my life?"

13:35.606 --> 13:39.401
<i>My problem with clothing</i>
<i>and feeling the joy,</i>

13:39.485 --> 13:44.281
<i>it's hard because it's that idea that you</i>
<i>don't let go of things if it's functional.</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:47.535
Like, you don't wear
cocktail dresses all the time,

13:47.618 --> 13:49.161
but if you have a cocktail party,

13:49.245 --> 13:51.372
you don't want to buy
a new one each time either.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.711
-Yes, Aaron, you're doing very well.
-You're doing great.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.713
- Very calm.
-Aren't you the best?

14:01.090 --> 14:04.134
-Don't the teachers like you?
-Don't get angry.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.136
<i>Aaron and I are different.</i>

14:06.220 --> 14:07.888
I'm funny, she's not.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.558
-My friends think I'm funny.
-Your friends think you're funny.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.770
<i>Um, yes, maybe Aaron's, like, quick</i>
<i>to want to</i>

14:14.854 --> 14:16.897
you know, be like,
"Okay, I gotta clear my space,"
and maybe I slow him down to be like,

14:19.108 --> 14:21.068
"Wait a minute,
I want you to really think, like,

14:21.151 --> 14:24.905
are you getting rid of anything
that might be important to you?"

14:24.989 --> 14:27.825
And for me, he's going to help me be like,

14:27.908 --> 14:30.327
"Alright, come on, you don't
need to hold onto those things.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.454
That's just more things
we have to clean up."

14:32.955 --> 14:34.456
-Thank you, bye bye.
-Thank you so much.
-Bye.
-Bye!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.502
A lot to do. The homework is now

14:38.586 --> 14:40.671
go through our clothes,
sort through the things we--

14:40.754 --> 14:42.214
that don't spark joy,
move them out.

14:43.632 --> 14:48.137
This is what happens when you
first start going through the process.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.182
<i>I do still feel stuck in the...</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:54.476
Like having...

14:54.560 --> 14:58.814
Being in the limbo of having clothes
that I need to hold onto.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.026
But when you say, "Have to hold onto,"
what do you mean have to hold?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.611
Why do you have to hold onto 'em?

15:04.111 --> 15:05.738
Like, you can just easily say,

15:05.821 --> 15:08.407
"This sparks joy, this doesn't spark joy."

15:08.490 --> 15:11.577
There's a certain amount of things that
I, yeah, honestly when I take a step back

15:11.660 --> 15:13.287
and I look at some of the stuff I have--

15:13.370 --> 15:16.081
Like, okay, do I want
to hold onto this because--

15:16.165 --> 15:17.875
You can't let go of that!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.543
See, this is why I can't show you things.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.087
<i>With Sehnita and I, I would love</i>
<i>better communication</i>

15:22.171 --> 15:24.298
<i>dealing with items in our house</i>

15:24.381 --> 15:26.926
because sometimes it feels like
she automatically goes and says,

15:27.009 --> 15:28.469
"No, we should keep it."

15:28.677 --> 15:30.262
That's a lot of stuff.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.056
We're gonna be here
'til midnight.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.767
-Not me. Nope.
<i>-We</i> are going to be here till midnight.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.353
I was gonna go downstairs
and play video games with Ashton.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.355
Goodbye.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.614
Folding clothes is so much fun!

15:49.239 --> 15:50.908
About folding baby clothes,

15:50.991 --> 15:53.285
here's how to fold baby onesies.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.788
First, fold in half vertically,

15:56.997 --> 15:59.500
tuck in the sleeves,

16:02.127 --> 16:04.713
fold it in half,

16:04.964 --> 16:08.425
and then fold into thirds.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.388
Like this, when it is folded
into a square, you are finished.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.807
Next, how to fold socks.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.768
Place one on top of the other

16:18.268 --> 16:19.895
and just fold them in half,

16:20.771 --> 16:22.314
making them very compact.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.775
How to fold underwear.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.988
Fold the bottom up.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.616
Next fold it in half,

16:32.950 --> 16:35.327
and then in half again.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.750
That's my blue jeans here.
This is gonna be my sweaters here.

16:41.834 --> 16:46.088
I think I'm getting close to
getting my stuff gone through.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.881
I feel good, um...

16:50.217 --> 16:52.219
Isn't that great? He feels good.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.889
I am finding it really challenging
to go through my clothes

16:55.973 --> 16:58.392
because even things I like don't fit well,

16:58.475 --> 17:01.812
so I'm not willing to let go
of all those things.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.440
I just realized I'm on camera
and I didn't put on makeup.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.109
Hmm. Alright, so I'm gonna end this video.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.498
- Hey, Sehnita.
-Yeah?

17:21.665 --> 17:22.958
- Marie's here.
-Oh, okay.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.628
-Hi, good morning.
-Good morning.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.255
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.216
-Morning, good to see you.
-Sehnita's just upstairs doing some work.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.886
These are all the clothes
we'll be getting rid of.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.971
So this is a mixture
of Sehnita's and mine.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.349
- That's wonderful.
- Yes.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.977
And she's in Ashton's room.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.562
Ooh.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.815
-Good morning, hi!
-Hi, Marie. How are you?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.609
Good to see you.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.319
-Good morning.
-Good morning, how are you?

17:50.402 --> 17:53.822
I'm feverishly trying to
go through these, uh, scarves

17:53.906 --> 17:55.908
and you're here at a perfect time
'cause I was like

17:55.991 --> 17:58.285
I don't know if I know how to fold them.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.915
Oh, but you did it just right.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.000
-Nearly there.
-Okay.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.877
Okay, so first...

18:10.255 --> 18:13.675
I would make sure that
the fringe is rolled inside.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.718
Okay.

18:18.764 --> 18:23.435
This way you'll protect the fringes
and you'll avoid any unwanted wrinkles.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.730
And then if they're different sizes,
like, I was trying to do this one

18:26.814 --> 18:31.026
and it was a little bit bigger,
so do I try to get it this size?

18:33.195 --> 18:36.281
So you can just categorize by size
if that's the case.

18:36.365 --> 18:41.495
I'm sure you have other bigger scarves
as well, so just keep those together.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.082
Well I'm-- I like this method
because honestly, um,

18:45.165 --> 18:49.461
it was so hard when I was stacking them
to know what color was in there,

18:49.545 --> 18:53.090
which one to get,
so I probably didn't use them

18:53.173 --> 18:55.551
as much as I wanted to
because I couldn't see them.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.470
This applies to every
storage space,

18:58.554 --> 19:01.390
but when you open the drawer and
you can immediately see what's inside,

19:01.473 --> 19:02.307
it's really useful.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.435
It is so useful. It was a lot of work.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.313
It was a lot of work to go through
all of our clothes,

19:08.397 --> 19:11.233
um, but we're ready
for the next challenge.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.990
<i>We have ten boxes of books,</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:19.867
<i>four or five boxes of magazines.</i>

19:24.163 --> 19:26.498
Something that I do
is to wake them up first.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.835
Books that have been stored in boxes
for a long time are sleeping.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.420
They would like some waking up.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.713
-Yes

19:32.796 --> 19:35.007
They're all sleepy.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.386
And once we've woken them up
take each book, one by one,

19:39.469 --> 19:42.556
and ask yourself, "Is this something
that I would like to bring with me

19:42.639 --> 19:43.807
into the future?"

19:43.891 --> 19:46.101
<i>Books are a part of my identity.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:50.397
I mean, I do really value them
and I value them being in our house.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.150
<i>It will be very hard for me</i>
<i>to get rid of them.</i>

19:53.233 --> 19:55.569
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.655
It just feels like
those are people's works.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.201
Just to, like, kinda just
dump them in a trash heap--

20:02.409 --> 20:04.244
it doesn't feel good to me.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.622
Think you're gonna use this
or you have the internet?

20:07.456 --> 20:08.540
You got the internet.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.711
-Don't you think?
-Can it be in a maybe pile?

20:13.462 --> 20:14.713
Where's your maybe pile?

20:15.964 --> 20:17.841
Here.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.720
<i>I definitely understand Sehnita</i>
<i>seeing certain items</i>

20:21.803 --> 20:24.223
<i>and struggling with it as far as looking</i>
<i>and saying, you know,</i>

20:24.306 --> 20:27.434
<i>"Does it bring me joy or does it</i>
<i>bring me guilt for getting rid of it?"</i>

20:27.517 --> 20:30.896
<i>Because even if she said</i>
<i>it's okay to let it go,</i>

20:30.979 --> 20:32.189
she'll have second thoughts.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.024
-Let's get rid of 'em.
-No, I'm going--

20:34.107 --> 20:36.860
No, I'm not gonna get rid--
We can't get rid of them.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.946
We're going to give them
for the other baby.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.322
Why are you whispering to me?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.574
Because I'm trying not to yell.

20:46.828 --> 20:50.540
Because we're definitely
on, uh, different pages about

20:50.874 --> 20:53.043
saving books for a potential third.

20:53.126 --> 20:58.298
I don't want to, at this point,
get rid of everything just...

20:59.258 --> 21:01.051
<i>to have to go buy them again next year.</i>

21:01.134 --> 21:03.887
<i>That doesn't make sense to me.</i>
<i>That doesn't make fiscal sense to me.</i>

21:04.471 --> 21:07.140
Like, with her I'd have to make
her feel okay
that I'm not just going to get rid of
things that she wants

21:09.977 --> 21:12.312
<i>because I know there is</i>
<i>still this fear in her mind that</i>

21:12.396 --> 21:15.941
<i>every stage she's concerned</i>
<i>that I'm going to move things out</i>

21:16.024 --> 21:18.193
that she's going to regret losing.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.153
Final check for the books, I guess.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.865
Sehnita's just doing a one last review
of the books in here.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.575
Um, I thought they were all boxed.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.703
I said, "Hey I'm gonna
take these to the garage."

21:27.786 --> 21:29.997
She was like, "I want one more look."

21:31.039 --> 21:35.002
So, so close.
I guess this is the final stage.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.046
Uh-oh, she's got a pile
of books she's holding onto.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.468
Oh, Sehni.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.138
Marie's here with boxes.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.224
- Hello.
-Hello!

21:49.641 --> 21:50.684
Can I help?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.686
- it's fine.
- You're fine?

21:52.769 --> 21:53.895
Hi, good to see you again.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.647
Hello, how are you?

21:55.772 --> 21:56.940
So good to see you.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.650
<i>The deeper we get into this,</i>

21:58.734 --> 22:01.611
it's really difficult to do.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.990
But I will say, little by little,

22:05.782 --> 22:08.452
walking into open spaces

22:08.869 --> 22:09.786
has been...

22:10.162 --> 22:11.705
Like, you feel it.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.416
You feel so much better.
And you know who's loving it the most?

22:14.499 --> 22:15.709
<i>Mazzie the cat.</i>

22:15.792 --> 22:17.919
She is loving the open spaces.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.504
She's pouncing here and there

22:19.588 --> 22:22.632
and I want to feel the joy
that cat is feeling.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.805
-So, books, pretty much done, I see?
- Yes.
We finished up the books.
It was tough, but like magazines,

22:31.558 --> 22:33.894
she actually got rid of
a lot of magazines.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.564
You might have thought that was a simple
task for me to get my magazines out,

22:37.647 --> 22:39.775
but they were there for...

22:39.858 --> 22:41.360
...a few days, weeks.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.154
Well done.

22:45.697 --> 22:49.326
Our focus going forward
is all the miscellaneous items.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.329
The garage and also the children's toys.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.296
So for toys, gather them
all together at once.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.550
You will be going through them as parents
and deciding how often do they get used,

23:05.634 --> 23:09.179
but I'm sure your kids have a particular
attachment to certain toys,

23:09.262 --> 23:11.139
so this is where you want
to engage the kids

23:11.223 --> 23:13.016
and work together with them as well.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.728
Really encourage them to thank
each item that they're letting go.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.610
When tidying kids' toys,

23:23.693 --> 23:27.823
take out all the toys first.

23:28.615 --> 23:33.161
If you have more than one child,
create a separate pile for each.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.080
For example, these are brother's,

23:35.163 --> 23:39.084
these are sister's,
and here are shared toys.

23:39.167 --> 23:43.380
Have your children choose
the toys that spark joy.

23:43.922 --> 23:49.344
However, all toys may spark joy for them.

23:49.428 --> 23:53.223
So ask them to rank the toys.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.392
When it comes to storing toys,

23:55.475 --> 23:57.853
it is important to divide
the space clearly.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.480
For example, this box is for him,

24:00.564 --> 24:05.318
these boxes are for both,
and one box is for her.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.404
When you store shared items,

24:08.029 --> 24:09.990
you can keep them according to category.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.410
Here are the toys for physical play.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.912
And here are stuffed animals.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.915
These can be stored like this.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.044
Thank you. Bye.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.629
-Bye!
-Bye, see you later.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.922
See you later!

24:26.006 --> 24:27.716
Okay, let's work.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.219
Toys.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.396
Toys are everywhere.
The toys, we have so many toys.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.191
Do you like your toys
all piled up, Natalia?

24:44.274 --> 24:46.026
- Yep.
- Happy birthday!

24:46.109 --> 24:47.944
-We got this for you.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.696
<i>I'm ready to get rid</i>
<i>of a lot of it.</i>

24:49.779 --> 24:53.283
<i>For Sehnita, the toys are tied</i>
<i>to emotional sentiment</i>

24:53.366 --> 24:55.577
with people who gave us particular toys,

24:55.994 --> 24:57.662
<i>the toys being attached to memories</i>

24:57.746 --> 24:59.831
<i>from when Ashton and Natalia</i>
<i>played with them.</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:01.333
Ashton wanted this case.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.210
Like, wanted when he was,
like, four years old?

25:03.293 --> 25:06.213
- Natalia probably wants it.
- You're killing me.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.424
I would like to keep
the Transformer types.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.884
I think they're kinda neat.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.053
-Um...
-But they don't really play with them.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.555
Yeah, but I do.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.350
Hey, Natalia, why's there
a mess on the floor?

25:18.683 --> 25:22.187
I-- 'Cause I wanted to give it away!

25:22.270 --> 25:24.231
- You want to give all that away?
-Yeah.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.732
So you were going through your toys

25:25.815 --> 25:27.734
and making a pile
of things you don't want?

25:27.817 --> 25:29.903
Uh, no, I want it.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.781
Can you pick out one toy
that you don't really play with anymore?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.199
Hmm, ah!

25:34.324 --> 25:35.992
Alright, and that's how you start.

25:37.827 --> 25:43.083
And everyone else is setting up
for a nice, somewhat lazy Sunday,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.293
but Mom and Dad are gonna
get off the couch

25:45.377 --> 25:47.087
and get up to work again.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.380
Not right now!

25:48.463 --> 25:50.257
But, dear!

25:52.259 --> 25:54.427
<i>The garage is a mini version</i>
<i>of our house.</i>

25:54.594 --> 25:56.930
<i>It has anything and everything in it.</i>

25:57.347 --> 25:58.932
What about all these, like, pots?

25:59.015 --> 26:00.767
Some of those pots are gonna go,

26:00.850 --> 26:04.271
some are going to have
our succulents put into it.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.605
Are we doing this right now?

26:05.689 --> 26:07.107
I'm just looking at this beauty.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.650
It is pretty, isn't it?

26:08.733 --> 26:11.236
I was being facetious. Sorry.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.489
I walk into it and I'm like,
"I don't know where to start."

26:14.573 --> 26:18.827
Bikes. We can't really get rid of any
of them because if we do have the third,

26:19.286 --> 26:20.328
they're going to want it.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.330
These two boxes are from the move,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.583
so we've been in this house
for seven years,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.418
we haven't unpacked those.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.212
But if we have the space for it
why can't we just keep it?

26:29.754 --> 26:32.173
Oh, Natalia's going to be
mad at you about this.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.009
I don't want to get to the point of

26:34.092 --> 26:36.720
throwing my hands up and saying,
"We're just gonna live in a pigsty."

26:36.803 --> 26:40.390
<i>But Sehnita's having a hard time</i>
<i>letting go of a lot of things.</i>

26:40.473 --> 26:41.933
<i>She needs to commit.</i>

26:42.017 --> 26:44.144
From zero to five years old,

26:44.227 --> 26:46.730
it's hard to give... give that up.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.982
What he says is, "We don't need this."

26:49.065 --> 26:54.029
And then I stop, "Well, no, I do,"
or, "I do want it."

26:54.112 --> 26:55.488
This is our garage

26:55.655 --> 26:58.617
and the only thing of tools
is one little shelf.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.660
-There's no garage stuff in here.
-Wait, honestly--

27:00.744 --> 27:02.537
-It's like toys and clothes and--
-Yes, so?

27:02.621 --> 27:03.830
Put it into perspective.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.000
One thing for tools,
the rest is everything else.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.711
You're making me the bad guy
for I don't know what.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.173
I definitely feel like
I'm being guilted into

27:13.423 --> 27:14.507
getting rid of things.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.052
I don't think that's what it's about.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.013
So if I go back to,
"Oh, no, I wanna keep that thing,"

27:20.096 --> 27:21.890
why isn't it a very clear,
like, "Okay, sure."

27:22.307 --> 27:24.601
I'm not gonna feel bad about that.
I'm sorry.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.812
So when you try to tell me
I don't let go of things,

27:27.896 --> 27:28.730
I don't like that.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.357
You have got to stop,

27:30.440 --> 27:32.150
otherwise we're never gonna
get through this.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.485
I'm at a loss.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.119
The more I think about it, the more...

27:43.870 --> 27:44.954
I just get upset.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.458
I get that I have a strong personality.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.170
I thought the whole process is,

27:52.379 --> 27:56.841
hey, you talk, you share, you share
your thoughts, your feelings...

27:57.926 --> 28:01.262
You-- You lay it all out there.
Well, I feel like...

28:03.515 --> 28:06.685
laying it all out there
only makes it worse.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.354
Maybe it's just a cultural difference.

28:09.437 --> 28:13.274
Maybe it's just different
styles and methods.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.528
And if that's the case,
I can't change someone else either.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.279
I'm looking to change.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.448
I'm open to change.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.868
I wanted to go through this process.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.578
And...

28:28.873 --> 28:30.500
This was my step forward,

28:30.709 --> 28:34.003
and I'm not looking to go backwards.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.046
So...

28:36.047 --> 28:38.383
this place is gonna get into shape...

28:39.801 --> 28:40.844
no matter what.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.512
And that's just how it is.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.272
What's a matter?

28:53.064 --> 28:53.898
Huh?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.069
<i>This has been a pretty</i>
<i>challenging and nerve-racking process</i>

28:58.153 --> 28:59.654
<i>for us to go through together.</i>

29:02.824 --> 29:04.909
<i>But now I realize</i>

29:04.993 --> 29:07.871
Aaron and I do not need
a lot of things to be happy,

29:08.163 --> 29:12.250
<i>and I think that's part of what</i>
<i>has drawn us to each other.</i>

29:12.459 --> 29:14.878
And to be able to come together

29:15.295 --> 29:18.715
<i>in this process</i>
<i>and re-establish that idea,</i>

29:18.798 --> 29:23.094
<i>you know, us in our family, like,</i>
<i>we don't need a lot of things, and...</i>

29:24.179 --> 29:28.683
that's been interesting because of all
of the things that we were surrounded by.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.769
I think we were forgetting that.

29:32.937 --> 29:33.897
<i>You want tea?</i>

29:34.898 --> 29:35.774
<i>Yes.</i>

29:37.317 --> 29:39.027
What time d'you
go to bed last night?

29:39.110 --> 29:40.361
Four, four-thirty.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.613
So what were you doing?

29:42.405 --> 29:46.534
Like, why am I holding onto
a seven-dollar shirt I got really cheap

29:46.618 --> 29:47.994
that doesn't really fit?

29:48.077 --> 29:50.997
It's kind of putting it in perspective.
I don't need to hold onto this.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.375
Every single one of us should be
examining the things we have and...

29:55.043 --> 29:56.669
deciding if we need it or not.

29:56.753 --> 30:01.090
I really just had this feeling
like I'm ready to let go,

30:01.174 --> 30:05.303
and to take control of the things
that are in my house.

30:05.386 --> 30:06.721
Are these garbage?

30:07.138 --> 30:08.223
Those shoes? Yes.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.267
I guess I'll just get rid of 'em.
You served me well, shoes.

30:11.684 --> 30:15.605
These things that are just
taking up space in your own house,

30:15.688 --> 30:17.065
you gotta give it up.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.608
Does it bring you joy?

30:18.942 --> 30:20.902
-Now, if it's nostalgia, the story--
-Not really.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.238
-Okay, well then--

30:23.321 --> 30:25.448
I mean, thank you!

30:28.785 --> 30:31.704
It feels good to sort of
move this out of the--

30:31.788 --> 30:34.499
yeah, out of the garage,
sort of move it out of our house

30:34.582 --> 30:36.292
and then to a better home.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.593
It is exhausting.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.805
I really do feel extremely exhausted

30:48.888 --> 30:51.766
and we're not even
at a halfway point yet.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.476
<i>Very overwhelmed.</i>

30:57.021 --> 30:58.022
So it's Friday.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.733
A couple days since we had
the mass chaos

31:00.817 --> 31:02.402
of dumping out a lot of things.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.237
Yeah!

31:04.320 --> 31:06.614
This, I think we need to get
a vase from outside.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.950
- I don't-- That can, those--
- It can go?

31:09.033 --> 31:11.327
Then I'll throw this stuff out. Great.
I'll be back.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.621
You got a little excited about that!

31:13.705 --> 31:15.331
She's doing a lot,
she's giving away a lot.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.876
I'm very proud of her, so I just
wanted to give her those kudos.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.168
Good job.

31:19.752 --> 31:20.712
Still cuckoo.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.548
-I mean, kudos. Lots of kudos.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.800
Now I feel we're on the same level.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.635
Same place.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.971
You'll never be at my level.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.519
-Hi! How are you?

31:37.145 --> 31:38.605
How are you? It's good to see you.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.981
Good to see you again.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.190
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.819
What's the occasion? So beautiful!

31:44.903 --> 31:47.447
Our last visit. I had to dress up.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.115
We can show you
the guest bedroom.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.533
Yes, definitely.

31:51.868 --> 31:55.038
<i>Beforehand I had to put</i>
<i>blinders on to the clutter.</i>

31:56.080 --> 31:58.291
<i>So now, it's just-- it's night and day.</i>

31:59.042 --> 32:00.752
- Oh, my gosh!

32:00.835 --> 32:02.837
- It's all clear.
- Look at this room.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.090
<i>All those cardboard boxes</i>
<i>are gone?</i>

32:06.174 --> 32:09.344
- <i>Gone.</i>
- <i>Yes, a lot of moving around.</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:13.264
I love this house. I love being here.
I love spending time here.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.476
<i>This process of looking</i>
<i>at what's in our life</i>

32:16.559 --> 32:19.979
<i>makes it so that we're not gonna</i>
<i>take the items we have for granted,</i>

32:20.063 --> 32:22.857
<i>that we're not going to just bring</i>
<i>more things into the household.</i>

32:24.275 --> 32:26.319
I love this dining room table.
It's beautiful.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.237
-You can see it now!
- Yes.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.491
There's some mental space that has
been cleared up through this process

32:31.574 --> 32:34.535
<i>and it was something</i>
<i>that I've needed for a very long time,</i>

32:34.619 --> 32:35.912
<i>so it feels very good.</i>

32:36.537 --> 32:37.747
You go right ahead.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.332
Wow.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.251
<i>The way we approach our house</i>
<i>feels vastly different</i>

32:42.335 --> 32:45.505
<i>and sort of the way we're trying</i>
<i>to live our lives feels vastly different.</i>

32:45.588 --> 32:47.048
- <i>Wow!</i>
- <i>Amazing.</i>

32:47.131 --> 32:50.760
<i>It's actually a very deep</i>
<i>and meaningful change</i>

32:50.843 --> 32:52.845
<i>that we can carry with us going forward.</i>

32:53.221 --> 32:56.641
<i>And it felt good to feel like</i>
<i>if it's not bringing joy,</i>

32:56.724 --> 32:59.978
<i>I can just go ahead and let it go,</i>
<i>I don't have to keep putting it back.</i>

33:00.269 --> 33:01.980
<i>Let go. It's easy.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:05.108
If we have a third, we can do this now,

33:05.191 --> 33:06.901
<i>because before it just felt like,</i>

33:06.985 --> 33:10.363
<i>"I'm gonna put the bassinet on a pile</i>
<i>of, like, junk and papers,</i>

33:10.446 --> 33:16.077
<i>but now I feel very good that</i>
<i>they would be well taken care of.</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:17.412
Like the other two.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.917
You can actually see from one end
to the next.

33:29.298 --> 33:32.176
<i>Look at this place!</i>
<i>How everything that was in here!</i>

33:32.260 --> 33:34.220
<i>-Oh, my goodness!</i>
- <i>We can park a car now.</i>

33:36.055 --> 33:38.016
- <i>I am speechless.</i>

33:38.099 --> 33:39.517
Aww!

33:41.811 --> 33:43.813
My method of tidying
really helps you

33:43.896 --> 33:46.065
not just clean the surface of your home,

33:46.149 --> 33:48.151
but to really consider
how you want to live

33:48.234 --> 33:50.028
and what kind of relationship
you want have

33:50.111 --> 33:53.865
with your family, with your friends,
and all the things that surround you.

33:53.948 --> 33:58.077
So I'm really happy and honored
that you really absorbed that.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.622
<i>This process, some ways,</i>
<i>has highlighted our opposite natures.</i>

34:01.706 --> 34:05.626
<i>At the same time, it did sort of help us</i>
<i>better understand each other,</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:08.671
<i>but also to work together</i>
<i>in a meaningful way.</i>

34:09.047 --> 34:13.217
It was kinda nice because this is a great
foundation to launch into the next stage.

34:13.634 --> 34:16.262
-Thank you for bringing your magic to us.
-Thank you!

34:16.345 --> 34:18.514
Thank you so much. Thank you.
-Bye, thank you very much.
-Bye!

34:20.850 --> 34:22.477
- Can you say bye again?
-Goodbye!

34:22.560 --> 34:24.771
Bye!

34:25.271 --> 34:26.981
- Bye.
- So cute!

34:27.065 --> 34:30.068
-Say bye.
-Bye, Marie! Bye, Miss Marie Kondo!

34:30.151 --> 34:32.028
Bye, Miss Marie Kondo!

34:32.111 --> 34:34.113
- Yeah, bye-bye.
