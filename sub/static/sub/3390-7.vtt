WEBVTT

01:00.966 --> 01:04.166
The car Seung-hee was in explodes
right in front of Hyun-jun,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.900
Hyun-jun attempts
to escape in a light aircraft,

01:09.400 --> 01:11.600
but it is taken down by Sa-woo's shooting.

01:21.066 --> 01:24.133
After Hyun-jun is saved
by anonymous people,

01:24.633 --> 01:25.600
he heads to Japan.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.100
Seung-hee takes a leave
of absence from the NSS

01:33.166 --> 01:35.833
and gets obsessed with finding out
whether Hyun-jun is alive or not.

01:42.233 --> 01:45.366
However, Hyun-jun is arrested
by the Japanese Intelligence Office

01:45.766 --> 01:47.233
and is interrogated.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.400
EPISODE 7

02:12.733 --> 02:14.666
What is it that you want?

02:29.100 --> 02:30.866
Are you preparing for a war?

02:32.766 --> 02:34.233
It's impossible to meet your requests.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.566
Once you give me what I want,

02:56.933 --> 02:58.333
I'll pay you twice as much as this.

03:26.766 --> 03:28.966
This is the expense report
for our overseas activities.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.366
But there's something strange.

03:32.133 --> 03:34.033
From our B2 emergency funds in Japan,

03:34.233 --> 03:36.500
a large amount of money was withdrawn
without prior approval.

03:37.566 --> 03:38.966
Are you aware of this by any chance?

03:39.866 --> 03:40.766
How much is it?

03:40.833 --> 03:41.866
Two million dollars.

03:43.566 --> 03:45.866
I dispatched an agent to the bank
where the fund was withdrawn

03:46.000 --> 03:47.066
to investigate the situation.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.666
Hands up!

04:53.933 --> 04:55.233
No heartbeat is detected.

04:55.633 --> 04:58.166
-Vasopressin, two milliliters.
-Got it. Injecting two milliliters.

06:53.966 --> 06:55.733
Shall we start again?

07:11.166 --> 07:12.933
Who are you?

07:18.800 --> 07:20.733
Tell me! What are you up to?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.600
We received an anonymous report

07:46.733 --> 07:48.400
that he tried to purchase a lot of weapons

07:48.666 --> 07:50.966
from a domestic arms dealer,
so we arrested him.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.100
The quantity itself was a problem,

07:53.266 --> 07:56.300
but the types of the weapons were
even more serious.

07:56.566 --> 07:59.800
He seems to be an assassin or a terrorist.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.900
Who are you?

08:17.433 --> 08:19.233
Why did you come to Japan?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.533
Tell me! What are you up to?

08:48.233 --> 08:49.166
Who in the world are you?

08:50.733 --> 08:51.966
-That's enough.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.266
Stop!

08:56.500 --> 08:58.833
It seems impossible
that we get him to confess.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.233
He tried to escape three times,

09:01.433 --> 09:03.800
and every time he did,

09:04.100 --> 09:05.700
many of our guards were seriously hurt.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.166
Without a doubt,

09:11.500 --> 09:13.466
he must've gone through
special training for years.

09:37.666 --> 09:38.533
Stay outside.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.500
That's too dangerous.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.666
Just leave.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.033
I work for the International Department

10:04.133 --> 10:05.733
at Cabinet Intelligence
and Research Office.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.366
I'm Erika Sato.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.300
You understand

10:12.333 --> 10:13.966
what I'm saying, right?

10:18.266 --> 10:19.633
We researched

10:20.033 --> 10:21.800
about your background.

10:24.533 --> 10:27.233
But we couldn't find anything.

10:28.966 --> 10:29.966
It's

10:31.066 --> 10:33.800
as if you didn't exist in this world.

10:37.733 --> 10:38.700
Why is that?

10:39.500 --> 10:41.800
Why do you keep trying to escape
when you know it's impossible?

10:47.033 --> 10:48.333
I'm not here

10:48.833 --> 10:51.500
to interrogate you.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.266
I'm here

10:58.966 --> 11:01.400
to release you.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.900
If you accept my offer,

11:09.266 --> 11:10.900
you'll become a free man.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.333
NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE

11:34.733 --> 11:35.733
Where is Seung-hee?

11:37.400 --> 11:38.300
I don't know.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.366
I can't reach her, either.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.933
Do you know that Sun-hwa Kim escaped?

11:42.633 --> 11:43.566
What did I tell you?

11:44.233 --> 11:46.700
I told you that you could put
Seung-hee in danger, Secretary Yang.

11:48.433 --> 11:49.900
If anything happens to Seung-hee,

11:52.366 --> 11:53.233
I will hold you

11:54.300 --> 11:55.633
fully responsible for that.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.033
Where is Seung-hee?

12:25.866 --> 12:27.300
It's been already two days

12:27.366 --> 12:29.000
since she didn't come home.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.166
Did anything happen

12:32.233 --> 12:33.733
to Seung-hee?

12:34.866 --> 12:36.300
No, it's not that.

12:36.933 --> 12:38.000
Please don't worry.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.400
It's Sun-hwa Kim.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.733
It's me.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.400
Where are you?

13:05.533 --> 13:06.600
My mother...

13:10.300 --> 13:11.433
and my siblings...

13:19.100 --> 13:20.200
Is it true

13:20.700 --> 13:21.900
that they're all dead?

13:24.700 --> 13:25.766
Didn't you promise me...

13:31.733 --> 13:33.800
that you would protect them?

13:43.166 --> 13:44.800
Sun-hwa, listen to me carefully.

13:47.566 --> 13:48.600
Sun-hwa Kim!

13:58.366 --> 14:00.366
Send a man to Japan to find Sun-hwa Kim.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.500
In her current state,

14:03.933 --> 14:05.266
we don't know what she'll do.

14:06.266 --> 14:07.200
I understand.

14:11.566 --> 14:13.100
Any progress in tracking down Sun-hwa Kim?

14:13.266 --> 14:14.333
We can't locate her.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.300
I think she already left the country.

14:16.966 --> 14:18.666
Did you locate Ms. Choi?

14:19.000 --> 14:19.966
Yes.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.233
Where is she?

14:21.300 --> 14:22.333
She's in Japan.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.933
The pill that Sun-hwa Kim took was R-phen
when she escaped.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.033
R-phen?

14:31.100 --> 14:34.066
R-phen is only provided
for the NSS special task agents.

14:34.733 --> 14:35.866
How could Sun-hwa Kim...

14:37.066 --> 14:38.533
I suspect Ms. Choi gave it to her

14:39.466 --> 14:40.966
during the interrogation.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.700
She intentionally let Sun-hwa Kim escape

14:44.400 --> 14:46.033
and planned to tag along behind her.

14:46.666 --> 14:48.166
Why would Seung-hee do things like that?

14:50.733 --> 14:51.733
Where is Seung-hee now?

14:52.366 --> 14:53.800
We've confirmed that she's in Japan.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.066
Keep this to yourself for now.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.933
Okay? And you should go bring her back.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.066
You should find her before this becomes
a bigger problem, okay?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.500
Seung-hee helped Sun-hwa Kim escape

15:11.266 --> 15:12.666
and is following her now.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.866
Do you know why Seung-hee did that?

15:16.466 --> 15:17.533
It's because of TK1.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.166
Hyun-jun Kim?

15:19.566 --> 15:23.000
Seung-hee still doesn't believe
that TK1 is dead.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.133
When Seong-cheol Yun was
assassinated in Hungary,

15:27.400 --> 15:28.566
Sun-hwa Kim was escorting him.

15:29.266 --> 15:33.033
Seung-hee believes that Sun-hwa Kim knows
whether TK1 is alive or not.

15:33.866 --> 15:34.866
Does anyone else know

15:35.666 --> 15:36.966
about what you just told me?

15:37.566 --> 15:38.466
No, sir.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.166
Keep it a secret.

15:44.666 --> 15:47.833
NAGASAKI PUB

15:59.500 --> 16:01.033
Where is he now?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.533
Where is he?

16:11.466 --> 16:12.700
Tell me.

16:13.533 --> 16:14.500
Where?

16:17.233 --> 16:18.433
In the high-security prison

16:20.633 --> 16:21.600
of the Cabinet Intelligence

16:22.766 --> 16:23.966
and Research Office

16:25.300 --> 16:27.033
in Akita.

18:25.233 --> 18:26.766
EMERGENCY EXIT

18:33.133 --> 18:36.900
The Secretary-General
of Social Justice Party, Masayuki Ito.

18:37.866 --> 18:41.200
He appears to be an elder statesman
who wins public confidence.

18:42.533 --> 18:45.733
In reality, he's nothing but a criminal,

18:45.900 --> 18:49.000
having ties with ten Japanese mafia groups
across the country.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.033
Our intelligence office can't take
any action against him,

18:53.433 --> 18:55.166
because it's too politically sensitive.

18:56.066 --> 18:57.600
If you get rid of him for us,

18:59.166 --> 19:03.300
you'll be granted your freedom.

20:25.966 --> 20:27.500
It's okay.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.566
Your forehead implies many blessings.

20:46.433 --> 20:50.566
Now it's guaranteed
that you'll live a long life, master.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.800
-That was the best!
-The best!

22:40.200 --> 22:42.500
Wasn't it a great show, master?

22:43.433 --> 22:45.800
Master? He's been assassinated!

22:50.633 --> 22:52.066
Master!

23:01.100 --> 23:02.333
He's not in sight yet.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.666
As soon as he makes an exit,
take care of him.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.400
Take care of him?

23:07.466 --> 23:09.200
It's too dangerous to keep him alive.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.800
But you didn't tell me that before.

23:11.933 --> 23:12.933
After all,

23:13.066 --> 23:14.900
he doesn't exist in this world.

23:59.066 --> 24:00.666
We lost him.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.600
We still don't see him.

24:03.966 --> 24:05.900
Only the security guards are seen.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.633
Retreat!

24:08.233 --> 24:09.900
You must not be caught by the guards.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.366
Yes, I understand.

24:12.633 --> 24:13.966
Let's leave.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.233
Yuki.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.700
Mister.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.300
Where have you been?

25:57.466 --> 25:59.700
How could you leave
without saying good-bye?

25:59.766 --> 26:00.900
When did you come back?

26:07.433 --> 26:08.833
I wear this every day,

26:08.966 --> 26:11.000
thinking of you, Mr. Hyun-jun.

26:12.433 --> 26:13.533
Mister.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.700
Mister.

26:15.666 --> 26:16.733
Mister.

26:18.466 --> 26:19.466
Mister.

26:20.233 --> 26:21.933
KAKUNODATE CITY HOSPITAL

26:57.300 --> 26:58.266
I confirmed him.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.733
Did Sun-hwa do that?

27:02.766 --> 27:04.333
From now on, you should take care of this.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.666
Find Sun-hwa first.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.766
Yes, sir.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.166
I'm tolerating you
for the debt I owe you in Korea.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.066
Stop following me now.

29:06.766 --> 29:08.166
You're looking for Hyun-jun, right?

29:09.933 --> 29:10.866
Where is he?

29:12.500 --> 29:13.666
Go back to Korea.

29:14.866 --> 29:15.966
Hyun-jun...

29:17.300 --> 29:18.266
He's alive, isn't he?

31:17.133 --> 31:18.033
What are you doing?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.900
If you kill her,
then we can't find Hyun-jun.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.100
Hyun-jun is dead!

31:21.900 --> 31:24.933
Everyone in the world knows it.
You're the only one who doesn't know it.

31:26.366 --> 31:27.366
He's alive.

31:29.533 --> 31:30.933
I'm sure he's still alive.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.566
Captain!

32:12.333 --> 32:13.300
I have something to report.

32:13.466 --> 32:14.366
What is it?

32:14.566 --> 32:17.266
This is a satellite image of the
Korean peninsula taken four minutes ago.

32:18.766 --> 32:20.933
Three vehicles from North Korea
crossed the armistice line

32:21.366 --> 32:23.033
and headed to South Korea.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.200
More than 200 vehicles cross

32:25.300 --> 32:27.366
the border every day.

32:27.933 --> 32:29.800
Did you really think
it was necessary to report it?

32:30.033 --> 32:31.066
This is different.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.500
When the vehicles were passing
through the armistice line,

32:34.033 --> 32:35.633
they didn't receive any inspection.

32:35.733 --> 32:36.600
What do you mean?

32:36.666 --> 32:39.200
They were never stopped for inspection
and are still on the move.

32:39.266 --> 32:41.600
You're saying
South Korean military allowed

32:41.666 --> 32:44.133
the North Korean vehicles
to pass through without an inspection?

32:44.400 --> 32:46.166
Yes, that is correct.

32:46.366 --> 32:49.700
That's impossible without the authority
from the high-ranking officials.

32:50.666 --> 32:53.966
Pick up anything from the communication
devices from the vehicles.

32:54.466 --> 32:56.400
We need to figure out what is going on.

32:56.966 --> 32:58.366
Yes, sir!

35:03.600 --> 35:04.900
Welcome, sir.

35:31.733 --> 35:34.600
They safely passed through
and are heading to the next destination.

35:37.233 --> 35:39.166
Do you really think this will be okay?

35:40.833 --> 35:41.866
Shouldn't we inform

35:42.500 --> 35:45.166
our neighboring countries,
or at least the U.S. about this?

35:46.033 --> 35:48.266
We may create
an unnecessary misunderstanding.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.333
North Korea is beleaguered
by enemies on all sides.

35:50.866 --> 35:53.533
Their overreaching nuclear development
program has been fatally hindered

35:53.933 --> 35:56.766
by the incident in Hungary.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.133
To make it worse,
even the people in North Korea

35:59.966 --> 36:02.733
started to question
about the state of affairs.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.833
If we don't do anything,
we may face a bigger challenge.

36:06.866 --> 36:08.833
It's time for the leaders
of the both countries

36:11.133 --> 36:13.433
to meet face-to-face
and find the solution to the problem.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.266
I believe

36:17.933 --> 36:19.066
that we need to take the lead

36:19.233 --> 36:20.733
in bring about change in North Korea.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.733
The vehicles from North Korea
passed through the perimeter of Seoul.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.833
To which agency do
the escort vehicles belong?

36:50.233 --> 36:51.400
It's an unregistered vehicle,

36:51.466 --> 36:53.900
but the plate is usually issued
for the Blue House security service.

36:53.966 --> 36:56.533
We should find out the current location
of the president and his aides.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.400
Wired and wireless phones, fax, email,

36:58.700 --> 36:59.700
and other communications.

36:59.766 --> 37:00.800
Begin tapping all of them.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.633
Did you want to see me, sir?

37:16.500 --> 37:17.666
Bring all of your investigations

37:18.033 --> 37:19.100
to an immediate stop.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.733
Are you saying this,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.466
even when you know
what we're investigating?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.133
The North Korean vehicles crossed
over the armistice line

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
even without any inspection

37:29.666 --> 37:30.866
and arrived in Seoul right now.

37:31.766 --> 37:32.733
The Blue House did it.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.300
Was the NSS kept out of the picture

37:37.100 --> 37:38.366
because of the incident in Hungary?

37:41.133 --> 37:43.066
Do you think I'm happy with this?

37:45.500 --> 37:46.466
Do as you're ordered.

38:01.266 --> 38:02.733
Stop all of the tracking operations

38:02.800 --> 38:04.766
and discard all the data
that you've obtained so far.

38:06.766 --> 38:07.700
Didn't you hear me?

38:08.733 --> 38:09.600
Halt the operation.

38:09.666 --> 38:11.866
Unidentified vehicles from North Korea
are on our soil now.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.100
Then, how can we stop the investigation?

38:14.633 --> 38:16.233
It's a special order from the director.

38:17.133 --> 38:18.066
Bring it to a halt.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.500
NAGASAKI PUB

38:57.466 --> 38:58.366
Get him!

39:13.466 --> 39:15.266
That crazy guy is here.

39:17.966 --> 39:18.800
Where's the gun?

39:19.066 --> 39:21.300
They're all in the safe in the basement.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.266
Stop him.

39:24.633 --> 39:25.866
-Stop him!
-Yes, sir!

40:23.966 --> 40:25.100
It's been a long time.

40:25.166 --> 40:26.366
I came here to retrieve my stuff.

40:26.533 --> 40:27.433
Your stuff?

40:29.533 --> 40:30.500
Oh, that...

40:31.366 --> 40:33.866
Of course, I kept it for you.

40:34.233 --> 40:35.700
Since you disappeared all of a sudden,

40:36.300 --> 40:37.533
I was really worried about you.

40:39.433 --> 40:40.366
There must be

40:41.633 --> 40:43.833
-some misunderstanding.
-Shut up!

40:44.733 --> 40:45.700
Where is my stuff?

40:56.700 --> 40:57.633
What about my ID?

40:58.700 --> 41:02.466
After all, you won't be able to
get on a plane with all these.

41:02.733 --> 41:03.733
It's the same for the ship.

41:04.766 --> 41:07.800
There's another way
for you to enter South Korea.

41:10.433 --> 41:11.466
I'm telling the truth.

41:12.066 --> 41:15.700
I'm not trying to trick you,
so please give me one week.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.133
It's true.

41:24.033 --> 41:25.266
Please believe me.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.166
There's a sad story behind this statue.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.433
Once upon a time,

42:03.666 --> 42:06.300
a beautiful woman
named Tatsuko lived here.

42:07.933 --> 42:09.566
She was in love with a man named Taro.

42:11.300 --> 42:12.533
But Tatsuko wanted

42:13.366 --> 42:15.100
to become younger and more beautiful.

42:17.433 --> 42:19.166
So she drank from the Fountain of Youth,

42:20.300 --> 42:21.533
but she fell under a spell

42:23.166 --> 42:25.166
and became a dragon
that protects Lake Tazawa.

42:27.733 --> 42:28.933
And Taro became a dragon as well,

42:29.733 --> 42:30.766
like Tatsuko,

42:31.833 --> 42:34.933
that protects Lake Towada way over there.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.433
The two of them were separated that way,

42:40.266 --> 42:41.366
but whenever the winter comes,

42:42.033 --> 42:44.166
they meet here in this lake
and share their love.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.200
Because of their unchanging love,

42:49.966 --> 42:50.866
this lake never freezes,

42:51.666 --> 42:53.100
no matter how cold it is.

42:57.233 --> 42:58.233
Why are you laughing?

43:00.200 --> 43:01.833
It's not sad, but scary.

43:03.633 --> 43:04.566
Why?

43:06.533 --> 43:10.700
Well, the two of them...
They just wanted to love each other,

43:12.600 --> 43:15.233
but you're saying that they turned
into monsters in different places.

43:18.033 --> 43:19.100
Monsters?

43:21.100 --> 43:21.966
You're right.

43:23.066 --> 43:24.133
Monsters...

43:26.933 --> 43:28.333
That makes it even sadder.

43:29.333 --> 43:30.166
What?

43:32.400 --> 43:33.500
The work that we're doing.

43:35.166 --> 43:36.533
If we keep doing this,

43:37.900 --> 43:39.166
you and I may become

43:40.066 --> 43:41.733
monsters one day.

43:54.433 --> 43:55.566
Shall we quit?

44:02.700 --> 44:04.266
Now we can't even if we want.

45:01.166 --> 45:04.166
PUB

45:12.400 --> 45:14.200
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

45:15.700 --> 45:17.133
You can sit over here.

45:24.700 --> 45:25.566
Welcome.

45:26.300 --> 45:27.866
What would you like to have?

45:28.600 --> 45:30.500
-Sake, please.
-Okay.

45:30.566 --> 45:31.666
Sake, please!

45:38.700 --> 45:41.366
In memory of Hyun-jun and Seung-hee's trip

45:44.300 --> 45:46.166
Shall we have a picture taken, too?

45:47.100 --> 45:48.366
Did you forget who you are?

45:48.900 --> 45:50.266
How dare you leave our picture here?

45:51.900 --> 45:53.766
Who would know us here?

45:54.600 --> 45:55.866
-Let's do it.
-What?

45:56.833 --> 45:57.733
Excuse me.

45:57.800 --> 45:58.933
You seriously...

45:59.033 --> 46:00.166
-Yes.
-You're really...

46:00.600 --> 46:02.033
-Could you take a picture for us?
-Sure.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.166
-Here we go.
-No, I don't--

46:03.233 --> 46:04.633
-No, I'm not doing this.
-Hurry up.

46:04.700 --> 46:06.200
-Smile!
-Seriously, come on.

46:06.566 --> 46:08.733
One, two, three!

46:21.533 --> 46:24.466
In memory of Hyun-jun and Seung-hee's trip

46:26.500 --> 46:27.433
You're so childish.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.900
I love being childish.

48:02.833 --> 48:04.466
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

48:05.166 --> 48:08.200
In memory of Hyun-jun and Seung-hee's trip

48:16.566 --> 48:20.533
I think she was here earlier.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.366
I'm not sure, though.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.400
Our neighboring countries
must have spent a busy day,

50:09.866 --> 50:12.166
worrying about the situation
of the Korean peninsula.

50:12.933 --> 50:14.266
Shouldn't we decide our own affairs

50:14.666 --> 50:17.066
as the owner of the Korean peninsula?

50:17.866 --> 50:19.566
After all, they're all third parties

50:19.633 --> 50:21.866
and act in their best interests.

50:22.166 --> 50:23.200
You're right.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.033
Now

50:25.200 --> 50:26.433
I wish you would get to the point.

50:28.633 --> 50:29.600
History shows us

50:31.000 --> 50:32.966
that the reunification
of divided countries occurred,

50:35.166 --> 50:37.866
not through elaborate
reunification planning,

50:39.366 --> 50:42.100
but through a dramatic event.

50:44.533 --> 50:45.666
It's probably because

50:46.666 --> 50:48.900
elaborate planning
and preparations are not sufficient

50:48.966 --> 50:50.666
to achieve reunification.

50:53.333 --> 50:55.833
During the planning,
there must have been constant protests

50:57.133 --> 50:59.566
both domestically and internationally.

51:02.366 --> 51:04.233
I believe the Korean peninsula
is the same case.

51:05.533 --> 51:07.000
If the united Korea should favor

51:07.366 --> 51:08.966
one of the countries

51:09.600 --> 51:11.500
among the U.S., China, Russia and Japan,

51:12.233 --> 51:13.400
it'd bring about great changes

51:13.900 --> 51:16.266
in the balance of power
that has been the pillar of peace

51:17.500 --> 51:19.133
in the Northeast Asia and the Pacific.

51:20.966 --> 51:23.700
Therefore, there's no reason
they'd welcome our reunification.

51:26.866 --> 51:28.800
I'd like to meet with President Kim

51:29.633 --> 51:31.366
and discuss the matter of reunification.

51:32.833 --> 51:33.833
Will that be possible?

51:37.600 --> 51:39.366
HAIL DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

51:43.666 --> 51:45.166
Could you guess the level

51:45.933 --> 51:47.333
of South Korea's nuclear capabilities?

51:48.533 --> 51:49.433
Since 1979,

51:50.066 --> 51:52.266
South Korea abandoned
all the technology and manpower

51:52.333 --> 51:54.600
that could weaponize
the nuclear program, right?

51:55.133 --> 51:56.066
That's true.

51:56.133 --> 51:57.833
However, once you develop the technology,

51:58.500 --> 51:59.566
it doesn't just vanish.

52:01.533 --> 52:02.666
Whenever it's necessary,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.466
we have the ability

52:06.733 --> 52:08.566
to build our nuclear weapons.

52:10.500 --> 52:14.666
We have 16 light water reactors and
four heavy water reactors in the country.

52:15.233 --> 52:16.666
There're more than 8,000 tons

52:17.666 --> 52:19.466
of nuclear fuel rods stored there.

52:19.533 --> 52:21.600
With these, we can produce
5,500 nuclear warheads,

52:23.333 --> 52:25.300
the same power as the Hiroshima bomb.

52:30.866 --> 52:31.800
To me, it sounds like

52:33.233 --> 52:35.700
you're threatening us
to drop our nuclear program

52:37.500 --> 52:39.966
because South Korea's nuclear capabilities
are more advanced than us.

52:41.566 --> 52:42.800
How could I do that?

52:44.000 --> 52:45.500
If the North abandons the nuclear program,

52:46.066 --> 52:47.800
I'm willing to help your country

52:48.300 --> 52:49.366
solve the domestic problems

52:49.600 --> 52:51.633
not to mention the isolation
from the rest of the world.

52:53.033 --> 52:54.066
To President Kim,

52:54.800 --> 52:56.800
please deliver my message.

53:01.833 --> 53:02.866
Come in.

53:08.133 --> 53:09.166
Did you want to see me, sir?

53:12.133 --> 53:13.466
Our Leader seems

53:14.800 --> 53:17.066
willing to accept
the South Korean president's offer.

53:19.333 --> 53:20.366
What do you think about it?

53:21.100 --> 53:22.800
If that is our leader's thought,

53:24.233 --> 53:26.366
there's no other way
but to hold the summit, isn't it?

53:27.133 --> 53:28.133
What I'm asking for

53:29.900 --> 53:31.533
are your personal thoughts on it.

53:32.433 --> 53:33.833
If we hold the summit now,

53:34.733 --> 53:36.666
we'll end up following
South Korea's intention.

53:37.466 --> 53:38.533
If that were to happen,

53:39.033 --> 53:40.766
our leader's authority would wane, too.

53:42.700 --> 53:43.600
You should stop it, sir.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.033
How?

53:47.800 --> 53:48.800
By what means?

53:56.933 --> 53:58.333
That overseas group under your control.

53:59.133 --> 54:00.566
Is it still available?

54:02.433 --> 54:03.300
Yes, sir.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.400
Let me handle this.

54:07.066 --> 54:08.033
I'll take care of it, sir.

54:25.233 --> 54:26.100
Follow me.

54:57.566 --> 54:59.133
We're leaving soon.

55:57.533 --> 55:58.933
Mister.

56:00.833 --> 56:01.666
Yuki.

56:03.133 --> 56:06.400
I am... scared.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.466
Where are you? Where?

56:14.533 --> 56:15.533
Inside the closet.

56:16.300 --> 56:20.500
Yuki, listen to me carefully.

56:22.833 --> 56:25.700
I'm coming. I'll be there right away.

56:26.333 --> 56:29.466
Don't move until I get there.

56:31.600 --> 56:32.700
Keep hiding in there.

56:37.133 --> 56:37.966
Yuki.

56:40.766 --> 56:41.633
Yuki.

56:44.033 --> 56:46.066
Yuki, what happened?

56:53.966 --> 56:55.100
Who is it?

56:56.033 --> 56:57.566
If you bring it,

56:58.866 --> 56:59.966
Yuki will be safe.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.600
In one hour,

57:03.600 --> 57:05.100
I'll see you at Hamaga dam.

57:06.366 --> 57:07.366
What is it that you want?

57:08.433 --> 57:09.500
What do you want me to bring?

57:11.000 --> 57:12.300
The USB drive that you received

57:13.500 --> 57:14.466
from Seung-ryong Hong.

57:17.533 --> 57:18.666
I'll give you one hour.

59:41.733 --> 59:42.666
Stop.

59:45.600 --> 59:46.633
Mister.

59:46.966 --> 59:48.033
Yuki, are you okay?

59:48.533 --> 59:50.666
Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine.

59:53.066 --> 59:53.966
Drop your gun.

59:59.633 --> 1:00:00.500
The USB drive.

1:00:00.566 --> 1:00:01.466
Let the girl go first.

1:00:34.766 --> 1:00:35.700
Password.

1:00:43.233 --> 1:00:44.600
SH0615

1:01:21.233 --> 1:01:22.200
Keep your head down.

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:11.866
I'd like to meet with President Kim

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:14.433
and discuss the matter of reunification.

1:02:15.333 --> 1:02:17.966
She doesn't believe that Hyun-jun is dead.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:19.600
If she doesn't,

1:02:19.666 --> 1:02:20.800
make her believe.

1:02:25.133 --> 1:02:26.033
Hurry! Call an ambulance!

1:02:26.100 --> 1:02:27.333
We should wait and see.

1:02:30.033 --> 1:02:31.000
It's been decoded.

1:02:31.933 --> 1:02:32.800
We found them.

1:02:41.533 --> 1:02:42.500
What is Iris?

1:02:43.566 --> 1:02:44.700
Sun-hwa Kim called you.

1:02:45.100 --> 1:02:45.966
Where is she?

1:02:46.033 --> 1:02:47.233
She's in Shanghai, China.

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:50.400
You need to go with me.
