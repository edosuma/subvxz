(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:21.200 --> 00:24.767
ANNOUNCER: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:24.833 --> 00:28.167
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:29.933 --> 00:32.467
Thank you very much indeed.
You're very kind.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.633
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.967
Thank you very much indeed.

00:38.167 --> 00:40.400
We have a fabulous show for you tonight.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.333
The illusions will leave you
in more ecstasy

00:42.400 --> 00:44.800
than the crowd
at a Calvin Harris concert.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.233
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-One for the kids.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.800
Now, time to meet the men of the hour.

00:49.867 --> 00:53.900
The prom king and king of Magic High,
it's Penn and Teller.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.967
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:00.733 --> 01:03.267
-Mr. Teller. Looking good as always.
-Sir.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.967
Penn, looking slim and good to go.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.000
Teller, ladies and gentlemen... (CHUCKLES)

01:15.733 --> 01:18.267
So sit back and get ready to be amazed,

01:18.333 --> 01:20.400
because it's time to meet
our first magician.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.300
I'm Riley Siegler,

01:25.367 --> 01:27.000
and I am That Magic Kid.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.900
<i>This is a huge opportunity,</i>

01:32.967 --> 01:34.967
<i>and I'm as excited as I've ever been.</i>

01:35.033 --> 01:36.267
I mostly do close-up magic.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.867
<i>Cards mostly, but sometimes I do coins,</i>
<i>sponge balls, you know, everything.</i>

01:40.933 --> 01:43.233
<i>I perform outside of Nat's,</i>
<i>because I'm trying to save up money</i>

01:43.300 --> 01:44.300
<i>for magic camp.</i>

01:44.500 --> 01:48.600
I think I'm an ordinary kid
most of the time. Well, more weird.

01:48.767 --> 01:49.967
<i>A lot of kids, you know, like,</i>

01:50.033 --> 01:52.000
<i>try to act as normal as they can</i>
<i>so they can be popular.</i>

01:52.067 --> 01:54.533
<i>I just really don't care</i>
<i>about being popular,</i>

01:54.600 --> 01:56.667
and so I just do
what I want to do sort of.

01:56.933 --> 02:00.200
<i>But my parents fully back me up</i>
<i>in my magic and everything I do.</i>

02:00.267 --> 02:02.600
Well, I want to perform in Las Vegas.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.800
-Um, you know, hi. Uh...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:05.900 --> 02:08.800
<i>I also want to be, you know,</i>
<i>a famous magician like Penn and Teller,</i>

02:08.866 --> 02:10.366
<i>'cause, you know, I just love to do magic,</i>

02:10.433 --> 02:13.133
and if I can get paid to do it then, yeah.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.767
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

02:19.467 --> 02:23.700
So our next performer
is just 13 years old,

02:23.767 --> 02:25.967
making him the youngest contender
in this edition of <i>Fool Us.</i>

02:26.033 --> 02:28.833
Let's hope that tonight
for him 13 is a lucky number.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.300
Please welcome the calm, cool,
and collected Riley Siegler.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.800
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

02:38.267 --> 02:40.133
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.300
This is a huge opportunity for me.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.333
Thank you, Penn and Teller,
for letting me perform

02:44.400 --> 02:46.200
on your stage at the Rio Hotel.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.967
Do you mind coming up here, please?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.133
Hello, Teller. Nice to meet you.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.067
I just want to say
I've always looked up to you.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.567
-(LAUGHTER)
-Very nice to meet you, Riley.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.467
-Well, thank you. (EXHALES DEEPLY)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:02.533 --> 03:05.367
So have you both heard of this game
called Three-Card Monte?

03:05.433 --> 03:06.967
-I have.
-Good.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.267
For those of you who don't know,

03:08.333 --> 03:09.967
it's a game that they play
in New York City,

03:10.033 --> 03:12.233
where they try to scam you
out of your money.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.400
I'm not gonna do that to you.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.567
-Good.
-(LAUGHTER)

03:14.633 --> 03:17.433
-I'll do it to you.
-(PENN CHUCKLES)

03:17.500 --> 03:20.267
The point of the game
is to follow the money card.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.000
That's gonna be the queen.

03:22.267 --> 03:24.667
-So where's the queen?
-Right there.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.133
But aren't you playing with him?

03:27.233 --> 03:29.967
Okay, good. They do want you
to win the first two times,

03:30.033 --> 03:31.867
so then you bet more money later.

03:32.167 --> 03:33.667
But then they add in a distraction card.

03:33.733 --> 03:35.067
That's gonna be the nine.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.200
So where's the queen?

03:40.167 --> 03:42.933
Let me try this again with three cards.
Maybe that'll make it easier.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.700
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:44.967 --> 03:46.267
Would you mind holding out your hand?

03:46.467 --> 03:47.600
-I don't.
-Thank you.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.800
We're gonna place the queen
right there in your hand.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.067
-Hmm-mmm.
-So where is the queen?

03:51.133 --> 03:52.467
I believe it's right here in my hand.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.267
-Should I turn it over?
-RILEY: Okay. Close.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.433
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
-PENN: Close. Very close.

03:58.433 --> 03:59.800
Do you mind holding out your hand?

03:59.867 --> 04:01.933
Thank you. We'll place the nine
right there in your hand.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.533
So where's the queen?

04:04.333 --> 04:06.467
-(SCOFFS)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:06.600 --> 04:08.000
(TELLER GROANS)

04:08.533 --> 04:09.533
RILEY: Okay, good.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.600
You're getting the hang of it.

04:11.667 --> 04:12.767
We'll make it easier for you.

04:12.833 --> 04:13.867
-Please.
-(CHUCKLES)

04:13.933 --> 04:15.200
We'll place the queen up here
in my pocket,

04:15.267 --> 04:16.800
-so you know where it is.
-Okay... I do.

04:16.867 --> 04:17.867
So where is the queen?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.600
Up there in your pocket,
where I know where it is.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.167
RILEY: Okay, we'll try again.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.900
You know what?
I have to confess something.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.800
-I'm cheating. I'm using three nines.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:29.867 --> 04:31.267
PENN: Uh-huh.
RILEY: I'm sorry.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.367
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

04:37.533 --> 04:39.000
I didn't lie to you about the first part.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.500
I did put the queen up here
in my pocket earlier.

04:40.733 --> 04:41.733
PENN: Uh-huh.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.533
Well, now it's really unfair,
'cause there's four cards.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.167
-I see.
-Yeah, so I'll get rid of this extra nine.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.500
Okay, good.

04:47.633 --> 04:49.267
So now we're back
at the starting position, right?

04:49.367 --> 04:50.367
PENN: We are.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.733
I still feel bad about lying
to you before...

04:53.800 --> 04:55.167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:55.400 --> 04:57.533
RILEY: So, uh, I'll make it a bit easier.
PENN: Okay.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.367
-RILEY: Make it so there's two queens.
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

04:59.433 --> 05:00.933
PENN: Oh, that's easier. Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.467
And you know what?
I've just admired you for so long

05:03.533 --> 05:05.833
I'll make it a full 50% chance.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.300
(ALL APPLAUDING)

05:11.867 --> 05:14.333
So now there's a full 50% chance
that you get a queen.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.433
Okay.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.533
Well, that's because I have
the three nines up here in my pocket.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.067
-PENN: Uh-huh.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:19.133 --> 05:21.233
Actually, right now do you mind
inspecting this sleeve?

05:22.067 --> 05:25.533
Just making sure that it's a normal sleeve
that you can get at any magic store.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.833
(BOTH LAUGH)

05:28.933 --> 05:30.000
Good?

05:30.067 --> 05:32.900
Okay, thank you. We're gonna place
the three queens down right there,

05:32.967 --> 05:35.067
-so we have the nines over here.
-PENN: Okay.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.633
RILEY: Gonna place them
inside the sleeve right there.

05:40.033 --> 05:43.300
Then we have the three queens over here.
So where are the queens?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.633
-Right there. In your hand.
-All of them?

05:45.867 --> 05:48.200
All three queens right there
in your left hand.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.100
Okay. (SIGHS)

05:50.167 --> 05:53.267
I tried to give you a chance
with that 50% thing.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.800
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-See, the three queens are over here,

05:57.867 --> 06:00.333
but it's not your fault,
because that is how

06:00.433 --> 06:03.500
-Three-Card Monte works.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

06:05.700 --> 06:07.133
-Very nicely done.
-Thank you.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.000
Thank you, Riley. Thank you. Perfect.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.333
ROSS: Riley Siegler, ladies and gentlemen.

06:12.467 --> 06:15.233
That was super.
Come round here, young man.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.167
What a fabulous job he did.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.867
Hey, you'd like to make this your career?

06:19.933 --> 06:21.533
This is what you'd like to work in,
in the future?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.900
Yes. If I can.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.933
And where do you perform normally?
Where do you get your experience?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I actually perform outside a diner in L.A.

06:28.067 --> 06:30.233
-Okay, okay.
-And I perform there every Sunday.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.667
And do you do it for money,
or do you just do it for fun?

06:32.733 --> 06:35.133
I do it for free,
but then people can tip me,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.033
and that's how I get enough money
to go to magic camp.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.500
That's fantastic. Okay.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.267
Riley, you did a great job.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.600
I know the fellows loved seeing you work.
We're gonna find out

06:42.667 --> 06:44.733
whether they know what you did.
But let me tell you.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.567
They've busted some of the best magicians
in the business,

06:46.633 --> 06:48.133
so whatever happens,
you did fabulously well.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Let's go to Penn.

06:49.267 --> 06:50.933
Well, first of all, you did fabulous.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.467
What a wonderful routine
and all put together,

06:53.533 --> 06:57.900
and with such panache, and style,
and confidence for someone your age.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.300
I wish I'd have had that.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.100
Uh, look straight ahead.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.200
If you don't like what you see,
go down a different road,

07:03.267 --> 07:06.533
because you're exactly what we were
when we were 13 years old,

07:06.600 --> 07:08.667
except probably a little better.

07:08.733 --> 07:11.500
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And you have all of the qualities

07:11.567 --> 07:14.200
you need to be a magician.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.133
You have the style, the class,
the confidence,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.767
and something that's usually
not considered a good thing,

07:19.833 --> 07:22.500
but in that routine
was a very, very good thing

07:22.567 --> 07:23.867
and is a very good thing for you

07:23.933 --> 07:28.533
in that you are a two-faced kid.
That's what you are.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.967
-You're two-faced.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:30.033 --> 07:32.100
You're lying, and you're two-faced,

07:32.167 --> 07:34.467
and we have a pretty good idea
of what you did,

07:34.533 --> 07:37.267
but we also want to help you
expand a little bit.

07:37.667 --> 07:41.400
We have a Penn and Teller
Fool Everyone magic kit

07:41.467 --> 07:42.633
-for you right here...
-Thank you.

07:42.733 --> 07:46.000
That I think you'll do great with.
So enjoy that.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.167
-You did a wonderful, wonderful job.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

07:48.267 --> 07:49.433
-Thank you, Riley.
-Thank you.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.400
Here you go. You can take that with you.

07:51.467 --> 07:52.667
-Have a good time.
-Thank you.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.900
Great job. Riley Siegler,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:54.967 --> 07:57.500
Great, great job, great job.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
Now, we are like a workout video really,

08:01.867 --> 08:03.467
except instead of making
your fat disappear,

08:03.533 --> 08:05.167
it'll probably just
be a beautiful assistant.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.533
So let's say hello to our next
potential fooler.

08:10.367 --> 08:11.533
JADE: <i>Hi, I'm Jade.</i>

08:11.600 --> 08:15.000
<i>At a very young age</i>
<i>my family and I moved to America,</i>

08:15.067 --> 08:17.067
looking for a better life,
and we found it.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.200
<i>When I was 16, I was offered</i>
<i>a job at the magic shop.</i>

08:20.267 --> 08:24.000
I wasn't interested in magic,
but I wanted to work, so I took it.

08:24.067 --> 08:27.433
<i>I was so shy back then</i>
<i>that they threatened to fire me.</i>

08:27.533 --> 08:31.900
And the threat of that encouraged me
to overcome my shyness.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.366
<i>My first show was</i>
<i>a little elementary school show,</i>

08:35.433 --> 08:38.299
<i>and I realized</i>
<i>I loved performing for children.</i>

08:38.366 --> 08:40.033
I decided I wanted to do more.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.400
<i>Once I mastered performing for children,</i>

08:42.467 --> 08:44.967
performing for adults was effortless.

08:45.033 --> 08:49.133
<i>Magic has brought out a way</i>
<i>for me to express myself.</i>

08:49.200 --> 08:53.133
People paint. People dance.
I do that with my magic.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.133
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

08:55.333 --> 08:56.867
Please welcome Jade.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.500

09:00.167 --> 09:01.800
JADE: Hello, everybody.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.200
Thank you for being here.

09:04.267 --> 09:08.300
At this moment,
I would like a volunteer to come up

09:08.367 --> 09:10.500
to help me out with this routine.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.200
Sir, in the plaid? If you don't mind.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.833
Please, let's give him
a nice big round of applause.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.767

09:21.133 --> 09:22.633
-What's your name?
-Tom.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.900
Tom, thanks for coming up here
and helping me out.

09:24.967 --> 09:28.667
And, Jonathan, at this point, I would like
for you to help me out as well.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.567
Let's give him a nice big round
of applause.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.000
-Thank you. Lovely to meet you.
-Jonathan.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.300
-You want me over here?
-Nice to meet you.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.367
In a moment I will get to that.
Yes, yes, yes.

09:36.433 --> 09:40.167
Um, right here, right now, what I'd like
for you to do for me, Jonathan,

09:40.233 --> 09:43.200
is to have you plant your feet firmly
on the stage.

09:43.267 --> 09:44.300
Face the audience,

09:44.367 --> 09:45.667
about shoulder width.

09:45.733 --> 09:47.433
-My shoulders or your shoulders?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

09:47.500 --> 09:49.967
That's perfect. Wonderful. All right.

09:50.033 --> 09:54.033
Now, if you don't mind I will put the pole
right next to your foot here.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.167
Okay, yes.

09:55.233 --> 09:58.400
If you'll extend your arm up here
and hold onto the pole.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.700
-Uh, the bamboo pole, right here. Exactly.
-Okay.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.400
-And we'll look cute together.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:05.233 --> 10:09.733
Now this is when I say, "Jonathan,
will you please assume the position?"

10:09.800 --> 10:11.100
This will be the position.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.567
If you say so.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.767
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:13.833 --> 10:17.633
So, Jonathan, would you mind
just putting the bamboo pole

10:17.700 --> 10:19.000
-on the table for now?
-Of course.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.333
Meanwhile, Tom, we've got
a very sharp pair of scissors

10:22.400 --> 10:24.200
I need for you to put away for me.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.933
Maybe in your pocket somewhere
that you won't hurt yourself with.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.000
And, Jonathan, I have
a kryptonite-green cord.

10:31.067 --> 10:33.667
Hold onto that. Check it out.
Pull on it. Stretch it.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.600
-Tom, you have one as well. Check it out.
-Yep.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.867
Does it feel strong?

10:38.933 --> 10:40.167
-"Strong"?
-Like it's not going to break?

10:40.233 --> 10:41.767
There are no weak points, correct?

10:41.833 --> 10:42.933
Strong, strong, strong.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.500
So, gentlemen,
why don't you step a little closer

10:46.567 --> 10:48.467
so my perfume doesn't go to waste?

10:48.533 --> 10:49.967
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:50.033 --> 10:51.800
-ROSS: Smells good.
-(JADE LAUGHS)

10:51.867 --> 10:58.100
Okay, now continue holding onto the cords
between your hands just in this position.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.700
I will ask you both to tie me up.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.800
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Because it's so short,

11:03.867 --> 11:07.100
I think the best thing for you to do
is to tie up just my thumbs.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.300
Is that okay?

11:08.367 --> 11:09.400
It's okay.

11:09.467 --> 11:12.533
-Well...
-(LAUGHING)

11:12.600 --> 11:13.667
Come on. It's Vegas.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.967
-Let's go crazy, shall we?
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

11:16.100 --> 11:17.800
-Another show perhaps.
-...

11:17.867 --> 11:22.067
Okay. So, Tom, if you don't mind,
I will turn my back to you.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.567
But, Jonathan, you will be the first.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.967
Would you please tie my thumbs together?
Pull upwards.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.600
-Put a nice tight knot.
-Like this? A nice tight knot like that?

11:29.667 --> 11:31.733
JADE: Yes, pull as tight as you can.
Put some muscle into it.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.667
-As tight as you can.
-ROSS: Oh, I don't want to go too tight.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.133
-JADE: No, a little tighter.
-What's your safe word?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.300
-Come on, let's establish something here.
-(LAUGHS) No. Go ahead.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.900
-Go ahead, baby. Okay.
-ROSS: That's as tight as I can go.

11:38.967 --> 11:41.467
-JADE: One more knot on top of that...
-I'm exhausted.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.400
-Okay. One more on top. One more.
-One more knot.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.033
JADE: Yes.
That'll hold everything in place.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.133
ROSS: You're crazy.
JADE: You got that?

11:46.200 --> 11:47.467
-As tight as you can.
-ROSS: Okay.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.033
All right, I'm gonna show you
what Jonathan's done so far.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.800
My thumbs are securely tied.
And now, Tom, this is your chance.

11:54.267 --> 11:55.967
Face the audience. Right.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.900
You can rearrange your arms if you like.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.133
Yes. Perfect.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.933
Pull a nice tight knot there. Oh!
Okay, okay, okay.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.033
Okay. I give. Okay.
One more knot if you don't mind.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.533
That'll lock everything in place.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.300
Okay good. Very good.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.500
Tom, do me a favor.
Take two big steps to the left.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.267
One. Two. Very good.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.933
And now this is when you
assume the position for me.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

12:19.067 --> 12:22.067
Tom, take those two cords closest to you.
Tie two more knots.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.367
Do it as tightly as you could. Tight.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.400
Very nice. Do that as quickly as you can.

12:28.033 --> 12:31.767
Pull. Very nice. As tight as you can.
All right.

12:31.833 --> 12:35.767
Take out the scissors if you don't mind,
and cut off the extra ends.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.833
Not too close to the knot. Right there.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.833
All three of them, if you don't mind.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.133
All right.
Now, Tom, will you tell the audience,

12:48.200 --> 12:49.933
am I securely tied in here?

12:50.733 --> 12:52.100
TOM: Yes.
JADE: Yes.

12:52.567 --> 12:55.233
-Jonathan, take a look.
-You look tied up to me.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.867
-Excellent. Nice and tight?
-You're secure.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.167
All right. Now, look at this.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.833
I'm gonna show the audience.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.433
If you'll take a quick look
this is how it looks.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.200
It all happens very quickly.

13:07.267 --> 13:11.333
I need you to just try not
to blink when I count to three.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.067
-Good, Tom?
-Yep.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.967
-All right. Are you ready?
-Ready.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.200
Here we go, then.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.100
One, two, three.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.233
Ha!

13:20.767 --> 13:23.033
-Wow.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

13:23.400 --> 13:24.467
Wow.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.667
Wow.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.733
-Thank you, Jonathan.
-Oh, my God...

13:30.867 --> 13:33.200
Well, let's try it again.
I want you to watch very closely.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.233
Hold on to the pole very tightly.
Make sure nothing happens.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.567
-Yep.
-Ha!

13:36.633 --> 13:38.633
Tell them, Tom.
Am I still securely tied in here?

13:38.867 --> 13:41.333
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-Nothing's changed.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.400
-One more time? Yes? One more time.
-One more? Okay.

13:47.467 --> 13:48.833
Two. Here we go.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.300
Ha! Ha!

13:51.633 --> 13:53.067
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
-Wow.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.533
Is that still through there?
It's all solid?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.600
-That is still tied up and still solid.
-Right through your arm.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.067
-Yeah. It went right through me.
-Nothing's changed?

13:58.133 --> 13:59.633
That's right. Right through your arm.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.833
Hold onto that right there. Excellent.
Watch very close.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.500
Right through the arm. Here we go.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.500
-Ha! Ha!
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)

14:07.733 --> 14:09.667
Will you tell them,
am I still securely tied in here?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.500
-Still secure.
-Nothing's changed?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.767
-TOM: Nothing's changed.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

14:19.767 --> 14:24.167
The last and final one will actually be
the most dangerous one for me,

14:24.233 --> 14:28.200
and this is where I need you, Jonathan,
to keep your feet in the same position...

14:28.267 --> 14:31.800
-Yes.
-...but to have two hands on the pole.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.167
Two hands...

14:34.233 --> 14:36.300
Come on, you're making up
your own jokes now.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.933
-Okay. (CHUCKLES)
-This pole.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.767
-Okay.
-Yes, yes.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.667
You can pull it closer. There you go.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.600
-Wow.
-Is that comfortable? Is that good?

14:44.667 --> 14:45.867
Feels very familiar.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.267
(LAUGHTER)

14:48.167 --> 14:50.300
-I'm still securely tied, right?
-Still tied.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.333
All right,
I want you to watch very closely.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.433
Here we go, then.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.667
On the count of three.

14:54.733 --> 14:57.867
-One, two, three. Ha!
-Whoa.

14:58.067 --> 15:01.533
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
-Oh. Wow. That was incredible.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.133
JADE: If you can walk towards Tom, please?

15:05.400 --> 15:08.167
Yeah, sure. Let's go this way.
You just wanna...

15:08.233 --> 15:11.533
Tom, you're gonna have to cut me free.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.867
Okay. There. I'm free, and I'm free.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.600
Tom, do you wanna come in
for some of this action?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.833
-Let's get a... What about me?
-Oh, she's gone.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.800
-Yeah, yeah. All right.
-Here we go.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.933
JADE: So let's give Tom a nice big round
of applause.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.800
Let's give Jade
a big round of applause as well.

15:25.033 --> 15:27.000
-Jade, that was phenomenal.
-JADE: Jonathan, thank you.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.133
Come and stand right here.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.300
Penn and Teller were studying
the whole performance,

15:30.367 --> 15:33.667
and I hadn't met Jade before the show,
so we hadn't done anything beforehand.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.933
They didn't let me see the act.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.767
Of course, Penn and Teller
didn't see it either.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.267
That was phenomenal,
and we have quite a lot of women magicians

15:39.333 --> 15:41.367
on the show,
but we have far more men performing.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.700
So is it something you'd encourage women
to get into, magic?

15:43.767 --> 15:48.533
Absolutely. Absolutely. I love it when
I perform, and the little young ladies

15:48.600 --> 15:50.933
come up to me, and they look at me,
and they say,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.433
"I really loved your performance."

15:53.533 --> 15:58.333
And in my heart I just hope that somehow
they'll go home and think,

15:58.400 --> 16:00.733
"You know what? I don't see
a whole lot of women out there,

16:00.800 --> 16:02.367
"but I saw one.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.567
-"Maybe I could do that." Right?
-Yeah, that's a lovely, empowering message

16:05.633 --> 16:07.833
-for all of the young women watching.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

16:07.900 --> 16:09.700
Absolutely on-message.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.867
Um, guys, what do you think of Jade's act,
and do you know how it was done?

16:12.933 --> 16:15.667
Well, it's wonderful to see this done
by a woman.

16:15.733 --> 16:20.133
It is, we believe, a Japanese trick
originally done with the...

16:20.200 --> 16:22.967
The paper you're using is the ropes
you're using around

16:23.033 --> 16:25.533
-Japanese woven paper...
-Exactly.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.367
...that actually helps the trick work.

16:27.433 --> 16:28.800
I don't want to give away
anything on this trick,

16:28.867 --> 16:33.733
because the Thumb Tie
is one of the classics of magic.

16:33.800 --> 16:38.067
There's lots of different versions of it,
and it's always entertaining,

16:38.133 --> 16:39.167
and it's always funny.

16:39.233 --> 16:43.000
And I believe the version you're doing
was done at least originally,

16:43.067 --> 16:49.200
as far as we know, in probably the 1930s
by a Japanese acrobat magician group

16:49.267 --> 16:51.800
called the Ten Ichi Troop

16:51.867 --> 16:55.700
that toured all over the U.S.
and were very, very famous.

16:55.767 --> 16:58.833
It was a wonderful part of their act,
and it was terrific.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.933
And seeing that done by a woman
is really wonderful.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.532
We can go into more of how it's done,

17:05.599 --> 17:07.500
but I think Ten Ichi should be enough.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.833
-It's good enough. Thank you very much.
-Thank you. Thank you.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.633
You're confident they know the techniques
we used there.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.333
Wow, they do know their stuff,
don't they?

17:15.400 --> 17:18.200
-They do know their stuff.
-But what a fabulous show you gave us.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.200
Thank you so much.
Let's say thank you again to Jade,

17:20.267 --> 17:21.900
-ladies and gentlemen.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

17:21.967 --> 17:23.833
That was lovely. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.000
JADE: Thank you.
ROSS: Jade.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.900
Let's meet our next contender.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.667
<i>My name is Ran'D Shine.</i>
<i>I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</i>

17:36.733 --> 17:39.033
<i>I got started with magic</i>
<i>in graduate school.</i>

17:39.100 --> 17:41.667
I really wanted to be a doctor or a nurse,

17:41.733 --> 17:45.267
<i>but I just saw some individuals</i>
<i>doing magic in the student cafeteria,</i>

17:45.333 --> 17:47.700
and magic is contagious. It is.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.600
<i>Went to my advisor and said,</i>
<i>"I'ma take a year off to perform magic."</i>

17:50.667 --> 17:52.767
She looked at me like I was crazy.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.233
<i>I just said, "I just need to give myself</i>
<i>one opportunity.</i>

17:55.300 --> 17:58.300
<i>"One chance just to see if I can do this."</i>

17:58.367 --> 18:00.767
<i>Nine years later, I'm still performing.</i>

18:00.833 --> 18:03.433
<i>Traveled all around the world.</i>
<i>Over 20 countries.</i>

18:03.500 --> 18:06.167
Performed for two presidential
inaugurations.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.733
<i>I think I can fool Penn and Teller.</i>

18:08.800 --> 18:11.633
No, actually thinking comes
from not knowing. I know I can.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.333
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
Here he is, Ran'D Shine.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.400
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:20.833 --> 18:26.633
"Ubuntu" is a South African
philosophical concept that means,

18:26.900 --> 18:31.333
"I am because you are,
and you are because I am."

18:31.400 --> 18:35.000
It speaks about the symbiotic relationship
between two individuals.

18:35.133 --> 18:40.667
Some even suggest that if those
two individuals have a strong connection,

18:40.733 --> 18:42.867
they will always be bonded together.

18:43.467 --> 18:47.567
So tonight I'd like to test that concept
utilizing Penn and Teller.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.800
Can you please join me on stage?
Thank you.

18:49.967 --> 18:52.000
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

18:54.400 --> 18:57.067
-Hello, Ran'D.
-Hey, how are you? How are you?

18:58.267 --> 19:01.567
Penn, would you be so kind
just to slide one card,

19:01.633 --> 19:03.500
just one card out the deck?

19:03.700 --> 19:05.633
PENN: I will.
RAN'D: Okay. Good.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.900
PENN: That card right there.
RAN'D: Yes. Right there.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.733
And just like you were playing
a game of poker,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.900
I want you just to cover it
and just peek at the card.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.667
-I will do that.
-Remember the color, the suit,

19:13.733 --> 19:16.067
-and the value of the card.
-Color, suit, and value of the card.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.200
-Okay.
-Okay. And slide it back in.

19:18.267 --> 19:19.933
-I will.
-RAN'D: Anywhere you want.

19:20.467 --> 19:21.933
PENN: How about there, Teller?
Is that okay?

19:22.233 --> 19:23.367
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That's good.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.467
Now, Teller,
you're going to select a card also.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.933
However, you're gonna do this by chance.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.400
Your choice.
The blue pill or the red pill.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.100
That's what we call dice in the hood.
Go ahead.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.600
(LAUGHTER)

19:37.333 --> 19:43.100
Now, since a die has six sides, I am going
to deal six equal piles of cards.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.200
I want both of you to watch to make sure
that I'm not utilizing

19:46.267 --> 19:48.600
any fancy sleight of hand.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.667
Each and every card is coming
from the top of the deck.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.167
Teller, can you pick up the die, please?

19:54.600 --> 19:56.900
And be prepared to roll it
in a few seconds.

19:56.967 --> 19:59.067
Now, Penn,
I get a sense neither one of these

19:59.133 --> 20:00.533
-is your card, am I correct?
-That's correct.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.400
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Teller, roll the die.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.300
Good. Now it's your choice.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.433
Should I start counting
from this side or this side?

20:07.567 --> 20:08.567
This side.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.267
That's one right here.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.333
What we're doing right now
is we're eliminating cards

20:13.400 --> 20:17.400
until we narrow it down
to one final card in the deck.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.200
Teller, can you pick up the die again?

20:21.733 --> 20:24.233
And I will deal another round
of six cards.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.267
Six even. And right there.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.100
-Penn, none of these is yours?
-No, no. those aren't.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.333
Oh, okay. I thought not.

20:29.533 --> 20:31.833
Okay, and roll the die, Teller.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.600
Four. Should I start counting
from this side or this side?

20:36.400 --> 20:39.200
That's one, two, three, four.

20:40.967 --> 20:42.367
So let's recap.

20:42.733 --> 20:44.400
A deck of cards is spread on the table.

20:44.467 --> 20:45.700
-That's right.
-You selected a card.

20:45.767 --> 20:47.133
-I did.
-You looked at the card.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.833
-I did.
-You memorized the color,

20:48.900 --> 20:50.600
-the suit, the value?
-Oh, the memorize part I didn't do.

20:50.733 --> 20:51.867
No, I'm just kidding.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.900
-Joking. Just joking.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:54.033 --> 20:55.800
I just kid once in a while.

20:55.867 --> 20:59.133
And, Teller, you've selected a die.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.833
You rolled the die.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.567
Uh, you selected the number,

21:02.633 --> 21:06.300
and you decided which side
I should start counting from.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.467
And we did this several times,
until we narrowed it down

21:09.533 --> 21:12.800
to one card and one card only.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.800
In the beginning I said

21:14.867 --> 21:18.033
this is a test of the concept
called "Ubuntu".

21:18.100 --> 21:20.900
The symbiotic relationship
between both of you.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.800
Penn, what was the card you selected?

21:24.867 --> 21:27.833
The card I selected
was the three of hearts.

21:27.933 --> 21:33.433
And that, my friends, is proof that
no matter what decisions you make,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.767
Penn and Teller will always be...

21:36.833 --> 21:38.200
Connected.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.933
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

21:43.967 --> 21:45.833
ROSS: Ran'D Shine, ladies and gentlemen.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.267
Come on round, Ran'D.
Meet me out in the front here.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.400
-That was super impressive. Wow.
-RAN'D: Thank you.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.600
Now, the guys specialize
in this kind of thing.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.267
-You know that and I know that.
-Right. Right.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.700
There must be something new
or something very different

21:58.767 --> 22:00.367
you're doing here to think
you can fool them.

22:00.433 --> 22:01.733
Yeah. I think I can.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.233
-I think I'm doing a little something.
-Something you invented yourself?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.600
Um, little tweaks here
and there of something old.

22:06.667 --> 22:07.867
Okay, so something they won't know.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.733
And have you shared this
with anyone else yet?

22:09.833 --> 22:11.000
A few.

22:11.067 --> 22:12.367
Yeah, 'cause occasionally
that could be the risk.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.200
Magic is a fairly small world,

22:14.267 --> 22:16.300
-and obviously guys share techniques.
-Yes.

22:16.367 --> 22:19.133
They share illusions.
And sometimes the guys get it easily,

22:19.200 --> 22:21.233
because they've encountered
someone who's talked about it.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.700
-Doesn't seem to be the case this time.
-Right.

22:23.767 --> 22:26.267
I think Penn and Teller are ready to talk.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.633
Let's find out what they have to say.

22:27.767 --> 22:30.200
Ran'D, sir, what a nice routine.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.767
-A very, very nice routine.
-Thank you.

22:31.833 --> 22:35.100
You know, you said something very true
in that routine.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.933
A lot of times magicians
lie all the way through.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.233
But you said at one point
there were no fancy sleights

22:42.367 --> 22:43.533
in this routine.

22:43.767 --> 22:45.767
No fancy sleight of hand.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.633
You said that outright.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.200
And I think during that moment
you were telling the truth,

22:51.467 --> 22:56.633
because I think that that card trick
could have had double endings.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.833
Could have had two different endings.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.767
Two different sides of the way
that trick could have gone.

23:01.833 --> 23:04.167
As a matter of fact,
a guy by the name of Claude Rix...

23:04.233 --> 23:05.367
-Is that right?
-Hmm.

23:05.433 --> 23:09.300
Claude Rix might have had
a good idea of the way

23:09.367 --> 23:10.800
the two ends could have been.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.600
We giving you enough hints right here,
or do you want more?

23:12.667 --> 23:14.533
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-Okay! (LAUGHS)

23:14.600 --> 23:16.300
-Yes!
-So you're confident

23:16.367 --> 23:18.400
they know what you did,
and that you didn't fool them?

23:18.467 --> 23:20.333
I'm confident that they know
what happened.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.067
-Wow. Okay.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

23:22.133 --> 23:23.200
Nicely done.

23:23.267 --> 23:24.833
ROSS: Ran'D Shine, ladies and gentlemen.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.033
PENN: Thanks again, Ran'D.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.600
It's a bit like a political debate.

23:29.667 --> 23:32.667
The most successful contestants
are often the best liars.

23:32.733 --> 23:34.300
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Let's meet our next fooler now.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.667
<i>Hi. I'm David Roth.</i>

23:39.100 --> 23:41.367
Some people say I'm their mentor,

23:41.433 --> 23:44.700
but I think I just help them out
with a couple of tricks.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.400
From the Magic Castle
I have several awards.

23:48.533 --> 23:52.567
<i>Visiting Magician, and Close-up Magician,</i>
<i>and Lecturer of the Year Award.</i>

23:52.633 --> 23:55.400
And then I got a creative fellowship.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.167
That was a great honor.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.700
In the old days, coin tricks were short.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.100
You make a coin disappear,

24:02.167 --> 24:03.800
and you pull it out of somebody's ear.

24:03.867 --> 24:07.033
<i>I wanted tricks that were longer,</i>
<i>more theatrical.</i>

24:07.100 --> 24:11.467
<i>So I created some original effects</i>
<i>that nobody had ever seen before.</i>

24:11.967 --> 24:16.633
A lot of people now do these routines,
and they don't realize it's my material.

24:18.167 --> 24:20.200
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

24:21.300 --> 24:24.100
Our next performer
is a magician of the old school.

24:24.167 --> 24:27.700
And let me just remind you, we don't
use camera tricks or false editing.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.900
Everything you see is as it happens.

24:29.967 --> 24:33.300
So please welcome

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

24:39.867 --> 24:41.200
Thank you.

24:41.367 --> 24:45.133
Penn, Teller, would you mind
please joining me at the table?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.700
PENN: I can't wait to see this.
DAVID: How you doing?

24:48.267 --> 24:49.433
Good to see you.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.767
I have something I'd like to show you.

U.S. Kennedy half-dollars.

25:00.700 --> 25:05.500
I won't be using all of them,
but four coins and a cup.

25:06.067 --> 25:09.567
Now, very few people know that
if you hold the coins and the cup

25:09.633 --> 25:11.200
at just the right angle... (BLOWS)

-and I think it's a coin.

25:17.533 --> 25:19.500
There are only three coins here.

25:19.567 --> 25:24.167
This is the first coin to travel
from my hand to the cup.

25:24.233 --> 25:28.100
That leaves one, two, three coins left.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.400
And that's the first one.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.167
Please notice,
I do not send them up my sleeve.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.633

-DAVID: Which leaves just two.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

25:51.567 --> 25:55.700
Two coins have traveled.
Two coins left to go.

25:55.767 --> 25:59.700
Now I'll be honest,
'cause you guys know a lot about magic,

25:59.767 --> 26:02.267
and the only reason
you didn't see these go

26:02.333 --> 26:03.800
-is because it happened by magic.

as these three silver coins,

27:06.100 --> 27:07.833

27:07.900 --> 27:10.533
so I'll do it again with coin number two.

The idea's the same.
It hasn't changed yet.

That means you actually see it change

27:29.700 --> 27:31.500
from a silver half-dollar

-to a Chinese coin.

to a Chinese coin.

(COINS CLINKING)

28:31.300 --> 28:33.200
Now watch this one,

28:33.267 --> 28:34.867
because it's gone.

28:34.933 --> 28:36.700
-Really gone.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

28:36.767 --> 28:40.867
Truly gone. Which leaves us two.

28:41.067 --> 28:44.100
(APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

28:45.167 --> 28:46.633
Watch the count.

28:46.700 --> 28:50.500
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.333
(BLOWS)

28:52.400 --> 28:53.833
And it's gone.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.433
-Really gone.
-(APPLAUSE)

28:55.500 --> 28:57.033
Truly gone.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.700
Which leaves just one.

28:59.767 --> 29:02.733
Now, what do you do
with a single coin?

29:02.800 --> 29:05.100
I can put it over there.
Bring it up over here.

29:05.167 --> 29:06.600
If I touch it to my elbow,

29:06.667 --> 29:08.067
it'll come over here.

29:08.133 --> 29:10.167
If I try to put it back,

29:10.233 --> 29:11.400
it'll come out over here,

29:11.467 --> 29:12.567
so, I'll put it over there

29:12.633 --> 29:14.367
-and make it jump across.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

29:14.433 --> 29:15.700
(PENN AND TELLER CHUCKLING)

29:15.767 --> 29:19.600
Or I could drop it over there.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.267
And you think it's here, but it isn't,

29:21.333 --> 29:23.533
'cause sometimes they really disappear,

29:23.600 --> 29:25.433
-but they never go far.
-(COIN KNOCKS AGAINST WOOD)

29:25.500 --> 29:29.100

twenty times larger.

-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

29:32.267 --> 29:33.567
Thank you.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.967
ROSS: David Roth, ladies and gentlemen.

29:36.033 --> 29:38.200
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:38.733 --> 29:42.733
David, that was incredible to watch.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.933
I saw that when your name
came on the screen

29:46.000 --> 29:48.400
and when Penn and Teller saw
who was gonna come out, they both smiled.

29:48.733 --> 29:50.600
They must know your name.
I know you are very well-known

29:50.667 --> 29:51.767
and respected in this industry.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.133
How long have you been performing for?

29:53.200 --> 29:54.833
Oh, since I was 10.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.367
Wow, so five or eight years?

29:56.433 --> 29:58.167
-Yeah. That's right.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

29:58.233 --> 30:00.633
And the trick you just did there,
is this one of your own?

30:00.700 --> 30:02.867
Because I believe
you have created a lot of tricks.

30:02.933 --> 30:03.967
Oh, yes.

30:04.033 --> 30:06.633
-That was all original material.
-Wow.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.533
Some of your tricks are being used
by other magicians I know.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.100
How does it feel when you see, uh,

30:10.167 --> 30:12.300
one of the new kids on the block
doing one of your tricks?

30:12.367 --> 30:14.733
If they do it well, it's very gratifying.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.400
If they do it badly,
I'm sorry I ever gave it away.

30:17.467 --> 30:18.967
(ALL LAUGHING)

30:19.467 --> 30:21.567
So, David, do you think you fooled 'em?

30:21.733 --> 30:24.633
I think I fooled 'em
with one particular part.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.600
The vanish at the end of the three coins.

30:26.667 --> 30:29.067
Okay. Well, let's find out
what they have to say about that.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.233
Penn, Teller? What's your verdict?

30:31.300 --> 30:33.500
David wrote the books

30:33.933 --> 30:37.800
on coin magic that we read.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.700
And seeing, uh, spellbound,
and coins across,

30:41.767 --> 30:45.667
and all those things
done that well, that close,

30:45.833 --> 30:47.233
that beautifully,

30:47.300 --> 30:48.767
that perfectly...

30:48.833 --> 30:53.433
I think that because we read the books,

30:53.833 --> 30:56.833
we have a pretty good idea

30:57.000 --> 30:59.067
how he did most of the stuff.

30:59.500 --> 31:03.300
And I do not give a good damn.

31:03.433 --> 31:06.433
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'm sitting here next to Teller.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.300
I don't care we have a pretty good idea.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.967
We have a pretty good idea
because of his books,

31:12.033 --> 31:15.167
and I'm gonna tell you, he fooled us.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.700
-No doubt about it.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

31:16.767 --> 31:20.200
There's no way
for him to do what he just did there.

31:20.267 --> 31:21.267
That was beautiful, man.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.900
Classic vanishing act.

31:22.967 --> 31:25.867
Just gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.900
Beautiful. Teller always gets to.

31:27.967 --> 31:29.167
May I do that, David?

31:29.233 --> 31:30.367
-Sure.
-Thank you so much.

31:30.433 --> 31:31.533
Thanks.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.033
-(APPLAUSE)
-Just a beautiful routine.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.567
ROSS: David Roth.
He fooled them, ladies and gentlemen.

31:39.267 --> 31:40.867
Wow.

31:43.433 --> 31:45.000
Now, I stand beside

31:45.067 --> 31:48.200
one of the most iconic and inspirational
sights in the world.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.900
The Stars and Stripes.
The beautiful flag of your country,

31:50.967 --> 31:52.933
the United States of America.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.333
Okay?
And I'm English, and we love this country.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.733
So take a good look while you can,

31:56.800 --> 31:58.733
because we're gonna come
and take it back from you

31:58.800 --> 32:01.300
-as soon as we can.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:01.367 --> 32:02.933
But while we're waiting,
why don't you enjoy

32:03.000 --> 32:06.433
the unique magical stylings
of Penn and Teller?

32:06.600 --> 32:09.200

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:53.033 --> 32:54.667
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

33:04.500 --> 33:07.200
That's one of my favorite bits
in our whole show right there.

33:07.267 --> 33:08.433
Handkerchief is there,

33:08.500 --> 33:10.033
and then it's gone.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.900
Sprinkles.

33:11.967 --> 33:14.467
-Ooh, it's a miracle.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

33:14.533 --> 33:17.000
And we're supposed to show you miracles

33:17.067 --> 33:20.800
that are, like all miracles, totally fake.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.333
We're also supposed to give you content.

33:23.400 --> 33:27.200
Something to think about.
And as beautiful as that moment is,

33:27.267 --> 33:28.933
it means nothing.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.600
And sometimes you can add content
to a bit merely by changing the props.

33:35.467 --> 33:38.333
What if instead of using
that white silk handkerchief,

33:38.400 --> 33:40.833
that meaningless piece of cloth,

33:40.900 --> 33:42.800
we were to use a piece of cloth

33:42.867 --> 33:45.667
that was nothing but meaning?

33:46.867 --> 33:48.100
Now, before we go any further,

33:48.167 --> 33:49.600
we'd like to reassure you,

33:49.667 --> 33:52.667
that we mean no disrespect
toward this flag.

33:52.733 --> 33:54.767
Teller and I are proud Americans.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.667
We consider ourselves to be patriotic.

33:57.933 --> 34:01.333
We got a little more patriotic
about 15 years ago,

34:01.400 --> 34:05.300
when we spent time in Egypt,
China, and India,

34:05.367 --> 34:08.500
because nothing
can make you love the USA more

34:08.967 --> 34:10.467
than overseas travel.

34:10.567 --> 34:11.667
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

34:11.733 --> 34:14.100
We were overseas,
we were humbled by the realization

34:14.167 --> 34:16.567
of how much of our prosperity,
and our happiness,

34:16.632 --> 34:18.533
even our individual personalities...

34:18.600 --> 34:21.900
How much of all of that
comes directly from the liberties

34:21.967 --> 34:24.500
that are symbolized by this flag.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.933
But even so, a couple of goofballs

34:28.500 --> 34:31.400
handling the flag onstage in Vegas

34:31.766 --> 34:34.699
does bring a weird kind of energy
to the room.

34:35.433 --> 34:38.266
It's energy we're talking about
when we talk about "content".

34:38.333 --> 34:41.100
'Cause with this piece of cloth onstage,

34:41.167 --> 34:43.132
there's a lot to think about.

34:44.067 --> 34:48.199
But the cloth was only one
of the three props Teller used.

34:48.266 --> 34:53.233
He also used a magic wand
and a meaningless piece of paper,

34:53.300 --> 34:56.667
which we'll replace with
a meaningful piece of paper.

34:57.433 --> 34:59.233
The Bill of Rights.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.767
The first 10 amendments
to the Constitution

35:02.833 --> 35:05.400
of the United States of America.

35:05.767 --> 35:06.833
This is... No, no, no, no.

35:06.900 --> 35:09.500
This is...
It's not the real original Bill of Rights.

35:09.567 --> 35:13.567
(CHUCKLES) We can't afford that yet,
but all the words.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.033
And more importantly,
all the ideas are on this paper.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.367
We have the First Amendment,
which is usually abbreviated,

35:19.433 --> 35:21.033
the "Freedom of Speech Amendment".

35:21.100 --> 35:25.400
And "speech" has been defined
rather broadly to include symbolic speech.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.467
And therefore, the Supreme Court has said

35:27.533 --> 35:30.733
we can do anything we want with this flag.

35:30.800 --> 35:34.433
The thinking seems to be no matter
what happens to the flag physically,

35:34.500 --> 35:39.200
symbolically it's always protected
by the Bill of Rights.

35:39.267 --> 35:42.133
So we need a piece of tinder

35:42.200 --> 35:45.700
and a very eccentric magic wand,

35:46.500 --> 35:48.667
-and we can do this.
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIM)

35:48.767 --> 35:50.367
And it's okay.

35:50.433 --> 35:52.467
See, while the flag is gone,

35:52.533 --> 35:55.167
the Bill of Rights remains.

35:55.233 --> 35:57.300
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

35:59.833 --> 36:03.100
We'd like to think we added
a little bit of content to that bit.

36:03.167 --> 36:04.267
First of all, there's an idea

36:04.333 --> 36:06.233
that Teller and I have been
talking about forever,

36:06.300 --> 36:09.833
and that is what would happen
if you were to burn a flag?

36:09.900 --> 36:10.900
Not in disgust.

36:10.967 --> 36:12.367
Not in protest of anything,

36:12.433 --> 36:15.400
but rather in celebration
of the very freedoms

36:15.467 --> 36:17.067
that flag symbolizes?

36:17.867 --> 36:21.000
But more relevant to our show
is the ambiguity.

36:21.067 --> 36:23.033
The fact...
Do you really know what's going on?

36:23.100 --> 36:24.300
I mean, did we burn a flag?

36:24.367 --> 36:26.700
Did we symbolically burn a flag?

36:26.767 --> 36:31.400
Or did we merely vanish a flag
in a patriotic flash of fireworks?

36:31.633 --> 36:33.067
Well, it's all of those.
It's none of those.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.133
It's up to you.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.433
You see, most shows, and movies,
and TV, are all fake.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.000
They're phony, they're fiction.

36:39.067 --> 36:41.567
And news and sports?
Eh, they're supposed to be real.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.800
But Penn and Teller?

36:43.433 --> 36:46.233
We like to drive fast
right on down the middle,

36:46.300 --> 36:49.600
because sometimes we're showing you
and telling you the truth

36:49.667 --> 36:52.367
as we see it
from the bottom of our hearts.

36:52.767 --> 36:56.400
And sometimes we're lying,
cheating, and swindling.

36:56.467 --> 36:59.367
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And it's up to you to figure that out.

36:59.433 --> 37:03.167
We can only allow you that freedom,
'cause we're working in a free country.

37:03.967 --> 37:06.367
If we were trying to do our show
in another country,

37:06.433 --> 37:09.533
a country without our Bill of Rights?

37:09.600 --> 37:11.633
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

37:11.700 --> 37:13.433
Well, things would be different.

37:13.500 --> 37:17.733
'Cause there's one thing
a totalitarian government cannot tolerate.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.533
It's ambiguity.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.200
They don't care very much
what you believe,

37:22.267 --> 37:25.033
as long as you all believe it together.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.567
So it wouldn't be enough to just show you

37:26.633 --> 37:28.500
that the flag was fine
at the end of the trick.

37:28.567 --> 37:30.100
Not in that context, no.

37:30.167 --> 37:32.567
Have to show you every step of the way.

37:32.633 --> 37:36.333
Make sure you're all thinking and feeling
the exact same thing.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.067
Make sure there was no dissent.

37:38.133 --> 37:40.500
-Make sure that you're all united.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

37:40.567 --> 37:41.700
And once we've done that,

37:41.767 --> 37:43.600
once we've laid it all out
and do whatever we want.

37:43.667 --> 37:46.467
Take a piece
of chemically-treated flash paper

37:46.533 --> 37:49.100
and a very eccentric wand,

37:49.167 --> 37:50.533
and we can do this.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.633
But it's a lousy trick.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.733
And that's why Penn and Teller
are so proud

37:54.800 --> 37:57.733
to work in the United States of America.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.967
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

38:03.867 --> 38:08.433

through the mist of the deep,

38:08.500 --> 38:12.900
where our foe's haughty host
in dread silence reposes,

38:12.967 --> 38:15.533
what is that which the breeze,
o'er the towering steep,

38:15.600 --> 38:19.633
as it fitfully blows,
half conceals, half discloses?

38:20.167 --> 38:22.433
Now it catches the gleam
