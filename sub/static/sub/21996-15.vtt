as a meeting hall

as the Knights of Pythias...

We clearly heard someone
whistling here,

and we just came here
and there was absolutely

02:48.702 --> 02:50.035
nobody back here

02:50.037 --> 02:52.671
that could have
caused that whistle.

Right, I just
came out because...

her security camera footage.

At first, we thought we just
captured a mysterious whistle,

03:35.916 --> 03:39.585
but it seems we have also
captured a disembodied voice.

This is why
we're setting up.

This sounds like
a German voice.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.636
So we've been here
for 10 minutes.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.640
We have received
a disembodied voice,

04:01.642 --> 04:03.208
possibly German.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.812
We've heard whistling, and we
weren't able to debunk it.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.314
This is just
10 minutes so far.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.086
We're going to go into the room
where the whistle came from.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.521
I don't know if this is a sign.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.856
Holy cow.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.957
What's going on
with you?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.296
I have chills through
my whole body.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.866
Do you feel that?
Yeah, I do.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.202
Who are you?

04:30.204 --> 04:32.170
I'm blown away at how
much activity

04:32.172 --> 04:34.072
we have already
experienced.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.576
There are strong and compelling
entities in this castle,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.478
and it feels like
they're drawn

04:39.480 --> 04:41.913
specifically to
Cindy's presence.

04:41.915 --> 04:45.384
Could there be a reason
why there would be

04:45.386 --> 04:48.186
activity around you
in particular?

04:48.188 --> 04:50.489
I felt drawn
to this place.

I felt at home.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.725
It scares me sometimes.

Things happen, and I feel
that I'm supposed to be here.

04:57.931 --> 05:02.868
Was there a couple nights
that you spent here?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.836
Yes.
The owners were gone,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.872
and I believe it was you
and your brother

05:06.874 --> 05:09.341
that had to stay here
for 2 nights...
Yes.

05:09.343 --> 05:13.211
...and were some terrifying
things that were happening.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.348
Well, the first night
we wanted to treat it

05:16.350 --> 05:18.016
like any housesitting job,

05:18.018 --> 05:20.352
so we had dinner
in the ballroom, played cards,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.921
spent the rest of the evening
in the front living room

05:22.923 --> 05:24.056
listening to music.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.757
We said,
"Let's go to bed."

05:25.759 --> 05:27.559
The dogs ran upstairs
ahead of us.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.429
They went into
the queen suite,

05:30.431 --> 05:33.465
and they were
making these noises
[ Barking ]

05:33.467 --> 05:35.100
that I've never
heard dogs make.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.968
So they were sensing
something.
[ Whimpering ]

05:36.970 --> 05:38.937
Looking in that room,
they did not want us

05:38.939 --> 05:41.039
in the sleeping area,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.709
so we went and we slept
in the same bed.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.877
He slept on the left.
I slept on the right.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.314
The first thing that we both
heard as soon as we got in

05:49.316 --> 05:51.917
and got settled
was a whistle.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.721
You heard the whistle
that we heard earlier?
Yeah.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.490
Now, when we investigated
Waverly Hills Sanatorium,

05:58.492 --> 06:00.726
whenever you heard
a whistle,

06:00.728 --> 06:04.062
that meant that something bad
was going to happen.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.966
The whistle.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.135
That's something that
we found out about a year ago.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.136
A lot of times when
something pretty good

06:11.138 --> 06:12.871
is about happen,
we'll get a whistle.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.708
Can I ask you another question
that's maybe personal?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.944
Sure.
Did you lose
your brother?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.946
Yes.
After we stayed here.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.014
Can I ask you
how he passed?

He took his life.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.829
Sorry, Jamie.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.598
I have his ashes.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.732
He's always in my heart.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.467
Those are his ashes?
Mm-hmm.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.336
Remembered later,
I kind of knew,

06:44.338 --> 06:47.572
but it was this thing
I kind of pushed out of my mind.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.876
I had a premonition dream
that first night.

06:50.878 --> 06:58.617
¶¶

06:58.619 --> 07:01.686
And you believe that
the nightmare that you had

07:01.688 --> 07:05.257
was a premonition
for his death?

07:05.259 --> 07:07.759
Yeah.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.227
I remember laying
there thinking,

07:09.229 --> 07:10.595
"I need to wake him up.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.397
I need to talk
to him about this."

07:12.399 --> 07:14.800
I looked up.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.802
I saw the -- a lady.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.370
She was just floating.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.305
She was looking
at me, and then,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.274
as sometimes
happens around here,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.376
she looked like
one of the owners,

07:24.378 --> 07:26.578
but she had long,
flowing white hair.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.046
She appeared...
She looked like Tamara?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.848
No, her mother.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.850
Then I kept thinking,
"They're just messing with me.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.585
They're just putting
these thoughts in my head."

07:33.587 --> 07:34.886
Who's they?
"I have got to
go to sleep."

07:34.888 --> 07:37.022
The spirits.

07:37.024 --> 07:41.927
Do you think it's possible
that something here

07:41.929 --> 07:45.530
could have affected
your brother?

07:45.532 --> 07:47.332
It's always possible.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.134
What I believe we
are dealing with

07:49.136 --> 07:51.636
is a deeply advanced entity,

07:51.638 --> 07:54.306
an entity with a plot
to use the living

07:54.308 --> 07:57.542
to tell the story
of itself in the afterlife

07:57.544 --> 07:59.411
by both portraying the living

07:59.413 --> 08:02.347
and supplying a glimpse
into the future,

08:02.349 --> 08:05.884
but only a glimpse
of dark things to come.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.553

08:08.555 --> 08:10.622
I'm talking with Jay,
and I look over,

08:10.624 --> 08:13.692
and in that darkness I saw
something that looked like it

08:13.694 --> 08:15.393
was kind of an oval head,

08:15.395 --> 08:18.396
and it just had two,
like, orange eyes.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.965
AARON: What are those
rooms down there?

08:22.436 --> 08:24.035
Those are the POW cells?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.304

that these were the POW cells?

we've been hearing already

08:34.548 --> 08:36.414
in that German voice,

08:36.416 --> 08:37.983
and knowing what I just saw,

08:37.985 --> 08:40.785
you know which countries
they would keep here?

08:40.787 --> 08:44.522
We had Germans,
Italians, and some Japanese.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.057
Do you think that Cindy

08:46.059 --> 08:48.593
has a strong connection
to your castle?

08:48.595 --> 08:50.528
I mean, some pretty dramatic
things have happened here

08:50.530 --> 08:53.064
in connection
with her.
Like what?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.767
One of the radiators
was thrown over one night.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.303
A heavy radiator was on
the ground and --

08:58.305 --> 08:59.537
Yeah, they're 600-pound
radiators.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.640
Was there any other things
connected to her

09:01.642 --> 09:03.575
or you that happened
the night that she --

Yeah, her brother
died that night.

09:09.683 --> 09:14.519
Her brother passed the night
that the radiator fell over?

09:14.521 --> 09:17.656

he liked to sit at.

things I've noticed here.

we can get anything here.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.743

the glowing eyes?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.411
BILLY: Okay.
Questions are leading...

10:46.413 --> 10:47.879
The question
leading to this,

10:47.881 --> 10:49.381
"What had the glowing eyes?"

10:54.054 --> 10:55.086
I hear, "A demon."

10:56.656 --> 10:58.323
Oh, don't bring
demons here.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.524
Do you hear it,
though?
Yes.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.826
I don't want to
agree that I do.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.929

that was now a female.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.799
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

11:07.801 --> 11:10.668
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:12.404
Can you slow that down?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.509
Don't tease it.
Don't tease it.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.412
I think that's
a warning.
That's clear.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.751
She said, "Don't tease it,"
as if it's a warning.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.353
Don't tease it,
or you're in trouble.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.855
Could this be a resident
human spirit

11:30.857 --> 11:33.425
warning us not to tease
the demon

11:33.427 --> 11:35.427
or else we will be in trouble?

11:35.429 --> 11:37.695
Did an entity here
have the power to push

11:37.697 --> 11:40.331
Cindy's brother
to take his own life?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.801
And is the whistler
and the German voice

11:42.803 --> 11:47.338
part of this
sinister web of evil?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.375
That's not a normal way
people kill themselves.

-I'm feeling it again.

This is day two of our
investigation at Pythian Castle.

12:50.179 --> 12:53.780
¶¶

12:53.782 --> 12:57.017
At Pythian Castle
in Springfield, Missouri,

12:57.019 --> 12:59.853
we've been overwhelmed
with dark experiences

12:59.855 --> 13:01.622
and tons of evidence.

13:01.624 --> 13:04.191
We're definitely dealing
with very powerful

13:04.193 --> 13:06.260
and dangerous entities.

13:08.998 --> 13:12.332
For tonight, we are
doing research,

13:12.334 --> 13:15.302
and even though Jay and I
just killed ourselves...

13:15.304 --> 13:16.436
Or wait a minute,
Aaron killed us.

13:16.438 --> 13:17.371
Aaron killed us.

13:17.373 --> 13:20.374
Aah!

13:22.444 --> 13:25.913
Our spirits are at the castle
doing their research right now.

13:25.915 --> 13:28.882
Look. This is a serious
investigation.
Yeah, very.

13:28.884 --> 13:31.051
But sometimes to break
that seriousness,

13:31.053 --> 13:32.553
we kind of reset
ourselves.

13:32.555 --> 13:33.954
It's kind of like
when you go and smell

13:33.956 --> 13:35.822
a lot of perfumes
at the perfume shop

13:35.824 --> 13:38.091
and you, like,
sniff the coffee beans.

13:38.093 --> 13:39.760
This is a good analogy.
Stop making a weird face.

13:39.762 --> 13:43.997
Okay.
And it's when you sniff
the coffee beans,

13:43.999 --> 13:46.033
and doing something
goofy and fun,

13:46.035 --> 13:49.303
those are the coffee beans to
kind of reset us to come back in

13:49.305 --> 13:51.505
after what we
experienced last night

13:51.507 --> 13:55.442
and start doing our research,
which we need to do

13:55.444 --> 13:57.444
because we have a serious
situation here.
There is a lot.

13:57.446 --> 14:00.414
Here is the one thing that
I'm most concerned about,

14:00.416 --> 14:01.882
this whole
mimicking thing.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.183
Yeah, it scares me, too.

14:03.185 --> 14:06.753
Now, Jay, describe to us
what doppelgangers are.

14:06.755 --> 14:07.921
A lot of people
throughout history,

14:07.923 --> 14:09.456
they claim that
they see themselves

14:09.458 --> 14:11.525
in some kind of spirit form
but they're still alive,

14:11.527 --> 14:13.594
or they see someone
they know that's alive,

14:13.596 --> 14:15.462
and it usually means
that their death is coming

14:15.464 --> 14:17.197
or something
very tragic...
Impending doom.

14:17.199 --> 14:19.266
...exactly, is going
to happen to them.

14:19.268 --> 14:21.168
Here is my concern.

14:21.170 --> 14:24.071
I'm worried because Cindy
already had the dream,

14:24.073 --> 14:26.573
the premonition that
he brother was going to die

14:26.575 --> 14:29.109
and what happened
to her brother?

14:29.111 --> 14:31.044
He died 3 weeks later.

14:31.046 --> 14:33.814
I'm worried and I'm concerned
for her wellbeing here.

14:33.816 --> 14:35.816
Absolutely.
The mother...

14:35.818 --> 14:40.654
Mm-hmm.
Having Cindy see Tamara,
the owner's mother,

14:40.656 --> 14:42.723
in her dream after
she woke up

14:42.725 --> 14:44.992
from the nightmare
where her brother died.
She said she was there.

14:44.994 --> 14:48.161
The doppelganging,
why is it happening here

14:48.163 --> 14:50.864
at the Pythian Castle?

14:50.866 --> 14:52.899
There is definitely
a demonic tie to it.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.701
A lot of people do believe
that it is demonic,

14:54.703 --> 14:57.838
and it leads into
demonic mimicking.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.339
I'm worried about
Cindy's brother

14:59.341 --> 15:01.441
who suffered
from depression

15:01.443 --> 15:05.679
and being in a place where
there possibly is dark forces.

15:05.681 --> 15:08.482
And we know they tend to feed
on those people that are,

15:08.484 --> 15:10.884
I hate to say it, but a little
weaker, maybe in their mind set.

15:10.886 --> 15:13.553
So we're going to look at some
death records real quick.

15:13.555 --> 15:15.155
We went through
all these.
Oh, there
is so many.

15:15.157 --> 15:16.923
This is about 100 death
certificates here

15:16.925 --> 15:18.358
at Pythian Castle.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.961
We found a few
that were real notable.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.831
¶¶

15:24.833 --> 15:27.334
This one happened
in 1942.

15:27.336 --> 15:31.805
This man cut his own
throat with a razor.

15:31.807 --> 15:35.642
¶¶

15:35.644 --> 15:38.311
That's not a normal way
people kill themselves, either.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.581
No.
So, like, the violence,
the intensity of that...

15:41.583 --> 15:44.685
Somebody that slits their own
throat, that's a lot of agony.

15:44.687 --> 15:47.421
Absolutely.
There is a lot
of pain involved.

15:47.423 --> 15:51.058
Would some thing have
induced this gentleman

15:51.060 --> 15:55.395
to take his life in one
of the most gruesome ways?
Yeah. Yeah.

15:55.397 --> 15:57.731
The pattern keeps going because
I just found another suicide.

15:57.733 --> 16:00.000
There's another one?
Yeah.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.770
This one,
January 26th, 1940,

16:03.772 --> 16:06.073
this man shot himself
in the head...
Really?

16:06.075 --> 16:08.542
...with a .22
long rifle.

16:08.544 --> 16:09.943
And a long rifle,
that's...

16:09.945 --> 16:12.245
That would be difficult.
To be able to do that...

fell down the stairs.

That's the question.

16:23.258 --> 16:26.493
Did he fall?

16:26.495 --> 16:28.395
Did you just feel that?
Yeah, it's something...

16:28.397 --> 16:30.263
I feel like something
just flew right between us.

16:30.265 --> 16:31.364
Yes, did you feel that?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.433
Yeah. It's like
a blast of something.

16:35.404 --> 16:38.271
There is no air-conditioning
vent from out here.

16:38.273 --> 16:40.173
I mean, the fact that we're
talking about this right now.

16:40.175 --> 16:41.708
There is an ice,

16:41.710 --> 16:46.213
ice-cold wind that just
shot right through here.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.181
Aaron, do you have
that recorder on you?
Here.

16:48.183 --> 16:50.984

are making

16:50.986 --> 16:54.921
to communicate with us are
absolutely unprecedented.

16:54.923 --> 16:57.424
I'm blown away.

16:57.426 --> 16:58.959
It happened when you were
talking about that.

16:58.961 --> 16:59.926
Yeah.
I was right there.

16:59.928 --> 17:01.161

There is an agenda of death
in this castle.

that doesn't want us

All right. We're just getting
ready to start our lockdown,

18:48.027 --> 18:49.360
ladies and gentlemen,

18:49.362 --> 18:54.899
and we're outside and Aaron
has just seen a soldier,

18:54.901 --> 18:57.635
a figure,
apparition.
Yeah, it looked like

18:57.637 --> 19:00.071
a soldier in almost
Vietnam camouflage.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.105
Now --
Does that make sense?

19:01.107 --> 19:03.040
Yeah. One of the layers
of history

19:03.042 --> 19:05.276
here of the Pythian
Castle was,

19:05.278 --> 19:06.878
this was used by
the military.

19:06.880 --> 19:11.215
It was used also to help
soldiers from wounds,

19:11.217 --> 19:14.852
and it was also used to
interrogate prisoners of war.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.855
One of those prisoners
of war, a German,

19:17.857 --> 19:20.124
whose voice we captured
during our interviews...

19:22.495 --> 19:24.295
This sounds like a German voice.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.197
...and who others
have captured --

19:26.199 --> 19:29.066
Oh, my God, dude.
That just gave me the creeps.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.935
You said that because
what if I saw

19:30.937 --> 19:34.305
was that German watching us
stand here at his castle?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.374
I don't know why that just
hit my head. I'm sorry.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.477
We are discovering that a lot
of paranormal events

19:39.479 --> 19:42.413
take place on the grounds
of the Pythian castle

19:42.415 --> 19:44.081
and not just inside.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.018
Earlier, I saw a face
with glowing eyes

19:47.020 --> 19:48.853
near these basement windows,

19:48.855 --> 19:52.990
which was followed by
compelling audio evidence.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.392
Whoa.

19:54.394 --> 19:58.362
It is now time to lock down
inside the Pythian Castle,

19:58.364 --> 20:01.799
and we begin by making our way
to the underground dungeon.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.101
All right. We're going to start
our investigation off

20:04.103 --> 20:07.204
by locking Jay downstairs
in the basement.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.175
This basement is huge.

20:11.177 --> 20:16.080
There are tons of actual
jail cells down here

20:16.082 --> 20:19.283
where they used to
keep prisoners of war.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.986
Down here, it looks like
solitary confinement

20:21.988 --> 20:26.657
from any massive prison
that we've ever investigated.

20:26.659 --> 20:32.663
So I've chosen this cell,
which is soundproof,

20:32.665 --> 20:36.701
has a solid door
that's very heavy.

20:36.703 --> 20:40.605
Jay, I'm going to put you
in isolation the entire night.

20:40.607 --> 20:44.275
All right.
There is two X
cameras in there.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.244
I'm going to lock you
inside there, okay?
Okay.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.313
You're not getting out
until the end of the night.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.415
Do you have
a walkie talkie?
I do have
a walkie talkie.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.051
I will give you
a walkie talkie.
All right.

20:54.053 --> 20:58.956
I want to isolate you in one
of these isolation cells

20:58.958 --> 21:03.494
just as one of the prisoners
of war would have been.

21:03.496 --> 21:07.665
I am using Jay as bait to see
if the spirit of the German POW

21:07.667 --> 21:10.368
will make contact with him
as his freedom

21:10.370 --> 21:12.336
is stripped away for tonight.

21:12.338 --> 21:15.339
¶¶

21:15.341 --> 21:16.741
BILLY: How does it feel
to not be on

21:16.743 --> 21:20.211
the other side
of that door?
So good. So good.

21:20.213 --> 21:24.548
If you want to investigate
with me, know one thing.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.684
I will lock you down
inside of an area

21:26.686 --> 21:29.253
that you will not want
to be locked down in,

21:29.255 --> 21:31.656
and you will be in there
for a long time.

21:33.826 --> 21:37.395
¶¶

21:37.397 --> 21:39.830
Billy, Aaron, and myself
will stick together

21:39.832 --> 21:41.365
as we begin our investigation

21:41.367 --> 21:44.068
by making our way up
to the second floor.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.916
All right.
The time is now

21:58.918 --> 22:03.020
to make contact with
the spirit world.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.423
There's over 100 deaths here,

22:05.425 --> 22:07.591
100 times that
you've transitioned

22:07.593 --> 22:10.528
to the spirit world.

22:10.530 --> 22:15.099
Is there any friendly
kindred spirits here

22:15.101 --> 22:19.003
that would like to help us
try to figure out

22:19.005 --> 22:22.339
what may be causing some of
the more negative things

22:22.341 --> 22:27.244
to happen here
with Cindy, with Tamara,

22:27.246 --> 22:32.016
and help us figure out
why Tamara's mother and Cindy

22:32.018 --> 22:35.286
are being mimicked
through apparitions?

22:35.288 --> 22:37.722
I want to find out if there
is something here

22:37.724 --> 22:42.126
that is influencing people
to commit suicide.

22:42.128 --> 22:46.230
On January 26th, Jess Ray
shot himself in the head

22:46.232 --> 22:48.232
with a .22 long rifle.

22:48.234 --> 22:51.068
On February 28th, 1942,

22:51.070 --> 22:53.270
William Renzenbrink
slit his throat

22:53.272 --> 22:55.906
with a razor, killing himself.

22:55.908 --> 23:00.511
Tragically, sadly,
there was a recent suicide,

23:00.513 --> 23:02.413
Cindy's brother.

23:02.415 --> 23:06.250
We need you to tell us what is
going on in this spirit world,

23:06.252 --> 23:09.420
this dimension that you
are existing in here

23:09.422 --> 23:11.956
at the Pythian Castle.

23:11.958 --> 23:15.760
We are going to come
upstairs now,

23:15.762 --> 23:19.396
and we would like for you to
begin by showing yourself to us.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.933
¶¶

23:22.935 --> 23:25.970
So far we've set up
cameras up here,

23:25.972 --> 23:27.772
upstairs, this floor,
downstairs.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.574
I have not felt
a single thing yet.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.076
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

23:32.078 --> 23:39.617
¶¶

23:39.619 --> 23:42.953
All right. Right now, we are
approaching the bedroom

23:42.955 --> 23:46.524
where Cindy and her brother
slept for 2 nights,

23:46.526 --> 23:50.461
and this was one of the most
terrifying nights of her life,

23:50.463 --> 23:53.164
and this is also when
she had that nightmare

23:53.166 --> 23:55.332
about the premonition
of her brother's death,

23:55.334 --> 23:58.836
and then he died,
took his own life 3 weeks later.

23:58.838 --> 24:07.411
¶¶

24:07.413 --> 24:09.647
This is the bedroom
where they slept.

24:09.649 --> 24:15.719
¶¶

24:15.721 --> 24:18.355
AARON: You want me to sit on
the bed and shoot me?

24:18.357 --> 24:20.524
Maybe, I -- Okay.
Go ahead.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.727
This is where she had that
dream where her brother died.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.095
Oh, yeah.

24:25.097 --> 24:29.133
¶¶

24:29.135 --> 24:30.401
Let's try this, Aaron.

24:30.403 --> 24:32.937
Why don't you try
making contact and find out

24:32.939 --> 24:34.638
if something caused this

24:34.640 --> 24:36.373
and just try to get
some answers,

24:36.375 --> 24:37.741
get us a response?
Yeah.

24:37.743 --> 24:38.943
Billy.
BILLY: Yeah?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.110
Where are you at?
Right here.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.879
I just set
that X up on him.

24:41.881 --> 24:42.880
Okay.

24:42.882 --> 24:46.116
Oh.
Are you all right?

24:46.118 --> 24:48.619
-You okay?
-Oh, my God.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.621
Is there anybody in danger?

24:50.623 --> 24:51.689
Ow. Ow.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.190
You don't have permission
to be in me.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.425
You will leave me.

25:02.762 --> 25:05.730
ZAK: In Springfield, Missouri,
at the Pythian Castle,

25:05.732 --> 25:08.099
things are taking
a strange turn.

25:08.101 --> 25:11.302
As Billy hits his shin hard
on a wooden chest,

25:11.304 --> 25:14.739
I see something amazing
appear on the SLS camera

25:14.741 --> 25:16.341
while he is pain.

25:16.343 --> 25:18.676
Hold on. I have a little
figure up there

25:18.678 --> 25:20.178
that just appeared
on the wall.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.679
-For real?
-Yeah.

25:24.984 --> 25:26.617
Aaron makes a great point.

25:26.619 --> 25:28.353
As soon as Billy hits his leg

25:28.355 --> 25:32.457
and endures raw, extreme pain,
this figure manifests.

25:32.459 --> 25:34.792
Could this be proof
of a negative spirit

25:34.794 --> 25:38.830
being drawn to this energized
shockwave of emotional pain?

25:38.832 --> 25:42.166
It is also very coincidental
that this figure hovers

25:42.168 --> 25:45.403
in the same exact spot
where Cindy saw an entity

25:45.405 --> 25:47.672
while she was having
her nightmare.

25:47.674 --> 25:49.207
SHIPLEY:
She was looking at me.

25:49.209 --> 25:52.110
I just captured a figure
hovering up on the wall,

25:52.112 --> 25:55.613
and you can see
it's not appearing again.

25:55.615 --> 25:59.183
There was a figure that
appeared up here floating.

25:59.185 --> 26:01.886
Billy, I think it was about the
same time as you hurt your knee.

26:01.888 --> 26:04.222
BILLY: Seriously?
AARON: The emotion
probably caused it.

26:04.224 --> 26:05.990
Oh, my God, dude.
I know we say --

26:05.992 --> 26:08.092
Ow. Ow.
What?

26:09.763 --> 26:11.596
That hurt.
What?

26:11.598 --> 26:15.166
Just felt like pins
being paved into my thumb.

26:15.168 --> 26:16.567
I know that sounds
crazy, but...

26:16.569 --> 26:18.569
Hey, you guys
don't even know this.

26:18.571 --> 26:20.838
Yesterday, you were
filming something else,

26:20.840 --> 26:22.173
and I was downstairs
with Cindy

26:22.175 --> 26:24.342
where we interviewed her,
where you met her,

26:24.344 --> 26:27.412
and she went like this,
"Ow! Ow!"

26:27.414 --> 26:31.315
¶¶

26:31.317 --> 26:34.752
I just had a real
bad panic attack.

26:34.754 --> 26:36.020
Panic attack?
Yeah.

26:36.022 --> 26:37.955
I feel this pricking
in my thumb,

26:37.957 --> 26:41.092
and then I just panicked.

26:41.094 --> 26:42.827
It's gone now.

26:42.829 --> 26:48.232
This very intense wave
of just doom, panic,

26:48.234 --> 26:51.068
and something bad was
just really going to happen.

26:51.070 --> 26:54.071
I feel a lot of aggression
right now.

26:54.073 --> 26:55.873
You can leave me.
You can leave my body.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.376
You don't have permission
to be in me or around me.

26:58.378 --> 26:59.577
Do you understand that?

26:59.579 --> 27:01.112
You don't have permission
to be in me,

27:01.114 --> 27:05.650
and you don't have permission
to do anything inside my mind.

27:05.652 --> 27:07.351
You will leave me.

27:07.353 --> 27:09.687
Shoot this on me right now.

27:09.689 --> 27:11.422
Hurry up!

27:11.424 --> 27:13.458
Sorry, Billy.
It's all right, man.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.060
¶¶

27:23.837 --> 27:25.670
I just feel frozen right now.

27:25.672 --> 27:29.307
I just felt something
touching my left elbow.

27:29.309 --> 27:31.709
That was really strange.

27:31.711 --> 27:34.145
As I'm feeling shrouded
by dark energy

27:34.147 --> 27:36.180
from whom I believe
to be the spirit

27:36.182 --> 27:38.516
that manifested
from Billy's pain,

27:38.518 --> 27:40.518
I slowly make my way to the bed

27:40.520 --> 27:44.021
then try to make contact while
the spirit is still around me.

we are not receiving any voices

28:31.538 --> 28:34.272
besides this one
particular male voice

28:34.274 --> 28:37.074
that has now spoken to us twice.

28:37.076 --> 28:39.443
Once again, we cannot make out
what he's saying.

with the spirit

that I feel attached to me,

28:56.396 --> 29:00.565
our SLS camera is about
to capture irrefutable proof

that this male spirit
is speaking with us.

are for a split second.

from the X camera shooting

30:48.015 --> 30:49.715
just outside his cell,

we notice an unexplained
light anomaly

that moves right as
the banging sounds occurs,

from picking at his feet...

34:04.679 --> 34:10.215
¶¶

34:10.217 --> 34:12.918
...to waking up
in fits of panic...

34:12.920 --> 34:22.161
¶¶

34:22.163 --> 34:31.403
¶¶

34:31.405 --> 34:34.640
...and now he starts
talking about aliens.

34:34.642 --> 34:40.613
¶¶

34:40.615 --> 34:46.585
¶¶

34:46.587 --> 34:50.422
I saw...

34:50.424 --> 34:54.393
When I woke up I saw
an extraterrestrial

34:54.395 --> 34:56.295
standing right here,

34:56.297 --> 34:59.932
right in the middle,

34:59.934 --> 35:01.834
scared me really bad.

35:01.836 --> 35:09.408
¶¶

35:09.410 --> 35:10.743
ZAK: So while, at the moment,

35:10.745 --> 35:13.646
Jay isn't capturing
any paranormal evidence,

35:13.648 --> 35:16.248
could he be feeling
the psychological effects

35:16.250 --> 35:19.518
of long-term isolation
in a pitch-black cell

35:19.520 --> 35:23.389
that carries with it
residual energy from whomever

35:23.391 --> 35:26.258
or whatever was once
tortured down here?

35:26.260 --> 35:30.462
¶¶

35:30.464 --> 35:33.632
AARON: Show yourself to me.

35:33.634 --> 35:37.703
I know you're watching us.

35:37.705 --> 35:39.805
Go ahead.

35:39.807 --> 35:41.540
Come right at my voice.

35:44.145 --> 35:45.344
Stop.

35:45.346 --> 35:47.579
Right now I'm going
to do playback.

35:47.581 --> 35:48.714
I don't know.
Something just told me

35:48.716 --> 35:52.951
to pull this out, so I did.

35:52.953 --> 35:55.621
<i>Rolling. Rolling.</i>

35:55.623 --> 35:57.890
<i>Talk into my hand.</i>
<i>Tell me who you are.</i>

35:57.892 --> 36:00.926
<i>We just heard you.</i>
<i>You know his name?</i>

36:00.928 --> 36:03.762
<i>You know where he's from?</i>

36:03.764 --> 36:05.497
Whoa. Whoa.
Did you hear that?

36:05.499 --> 36:08.233
It goes, "No" or something.

36:08.235 --> 36:10.069
<i>You know his name?</i>

36:10.071 --> 36:12.838
<i>You know where he's from?</i>

36:12.840 --> 36:14.540
"No!"

36:14.542 --> 36:17.576
I'm down here just to
find out some answers.

36:17.578 --> 36:20.079
ZAK: Can you knock
these bricks over?

36:20.081 --> 36:21.647
Tell me you just
heard that.

36:29.832 --> 36:32.533
ZAK: In the basement of
the Pythian Castle,

36:32.535 --> 36:35.536
Aaron and I capture
an aggressive EVP

36:35.538 --> 36:38.372
in one of the POW's cells.

36:38.374 --> 36:39.540
That's loud.

36:39.542 --> 36:40.941
Here, come over.

36:40.943 --> 36:42.609
<i>You know his name?</i>

36:42.611 --> 36:44.311
<i>You know where he's from?</i>

36:46.782 --> 36:48.649
I heard "no" clear as day.

36:48.651 --> 36:51.819
ZAK: While Aaron does capture
a very clear, "No,"

36:51.821 --> 36:53.120
we are very frustrated

36:53.122 --> 36:55.789
because after conducting
multiple EVP sessions,

36:55.791 --> 36:58.759
we aren't capturing
any class A EVPs.

36:58.761 --> 37:00.127
I decide to send Aaron

37:00.129 --> 37:02.429
to investigate
the underground tunnels

37:02.431 --> 37:05.065
while I return upstairs
to regroup with Billy

37:05.067 --> 37:07.468
so we can set up
an experiment in the room

37:07.470 --> 37:10.537
where a very heavy radiator
was thrown to the ground.

37:10.539 --> 37:13.474
One of the radiators
was thrown over one night.

37:13.476 --> 37:15.476
Okay.

37:15.478 --> 37:18.712
Kind of created
a little experiment here.

37:18.714 --> 37:22.549
I have a simple digital recorder
that I mounted on a tripod here,

37:22.551 --> 37:24.618
just so it's absolutely stable.

37:24.620 --> 37:27.421
There is no movement
in a human hand or nothing.

37:27.423 --> 37:30.524
It's just static,
mounted on a tripod.

37:30.526 --> 37:33.660
Right next to it,
but yet not interfering with it

37:33.662 --> 37:37.231
is a electromagnetic
energy detector, a Mel meter,

37:37.233 --> 37:40.234
and there is an
electromagnetic energy field

37:40.236 --> 37:41.935
being generated by this antenna,

37:41.937 --> 37:43.770
probably about this big.

37:43.772 --> 37:45.105
Picture this.

37:45.107 --> 37:48.876
So if a spirit comes in
to communicate with us

37:48.878 --> 37:50.377
or leaves us an EVP,

37:50.379 --> 37:53.380
I want to see if we can have
another device document

37:53.382 --> 37:57.050
at the same time
the presence of this spirit,

37:57.052 --> 38:01.288
so we'll either hear this,

38:01.290 --> 38:04.491
or we'll see a shift
in the milligauss reading.

38:04.493 --> 38:06.927
Right now it's
a baseline of 0.0,

38:06.929 --> 38:09.429
and even the temperature,
so three different ways

38:09.431 --> 38:11.899
to detect the spirit
that will speak here.

38:11.901 --> 38:19.673
¶¶

38:19.675 --> 38:22.109
AARON: Hello?

38:22.111 --> 38:23.677
[ Static ]

38:26.515 --> 38:28.181
Hello?

38:28.183 --> 38:31.218
ZAK: As Aaron says hello
to the spirits in the tunnel,

38:31.220 --> 38:34.655
an unexplained voice comes
through his walkie talkie.

38:34.657 --> 38:37.491
AARON: Hello?

38:39.895 --> 38:42.729
ZAK: Here is a few reasons
as to why this is unknown.

38:42.731 --> 38:46.600
First, it doesn't sound anything
like Jay, Billy, or myself.

38:46.602 --> 38:49.369
Secondly, we weren't on
our walkies at this time,

38:49.371 --> 38:51.138
and, finally,
deep in the tunnel,

38:51.140 --> 38:54.241
there shouldn't be any reception
for Aaron's walkie.

38:54.243 --> 38:56.977
Who is trying to speak
with him down here?

38:59.315 --> 39:00.581
AARON: I have some questions.

39:00.583 --> 39:05.619
I'm down here just to
find out some answers.

39:05.621 --> 39:07.120
What?

39:07.122 --> 39:09.756
Is that a shackle?

39:09.758 --> 39:12.659
ZAK: Do you see this device in
the center of the coffee table?

39:15.097 --> 39:16.830
Can you speak into it?

39:16.832 --> 39:19.900
¶¶

39:19.902 --> 39:24.771
If you had the strength to knock
a radiator like that down...

39:24.773 --> 39:27.441
That was hundreds of pounds.

39:27.443 --> 39:31.345
It takes no effort at all
to knock these over.

39:33.682 --> 39:35.682
Can you knock these bricks over?

39:44.627 --> 39:47.527
While the bricks that I set up
never get knocked over,

39:47.529 --> 39:51.064
watch what happens in the upper
left-hand corner of the screen.

39:51.066 --> 39:54.368
A strange ball of light
begins to manifest and hover

39:54.370 --> 39:55.969
in the same position,

39:55.971 --> 40:00.273
then another ball of light
manifests near the first one

40:00.275 --> 40:03.043
before taking a direct
diagonal path

40:03.045 --> 40:05.212
towards the digital recorder.

40:05.214 --> 40:08.015
Approximately 2 seconds
after this ball of light

40:08.017 --> 40:09.783
disappears near the recorder,

40:09.785 --> 40:13.253
we capture an electronic
voice phenomena.

40:25.501 --> 40:26.967
I'm almost at the end.

40:26.969 --> 40:29.970
I'm going to go all the way back
over there and keep going.

40:29.972 --> 40:32.739
What's your name, sir?

40:32.741 --> 40:35.676
Huh?

40:35.678 --> 40:42.082
Look at that -- rusty pipes.

40:42.084 --> 40:43.083
Whoa.

40:43.085 --> 40:44.985
Oh.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.520
So I've reached the end.

40:46.522 --> 40:48.989
You can see the IR
light way down there.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.558
Whew.

40:51.560 --> 40:54.428
You at home,
watching this right now,

40:54.430 --> 40:57.097
you have --
[ Skittering ]

41:05.474 --> 41:07.674
Tell me you just heard that.

41:07.676 --> 41:13.113
You at home, watching this
right now, you have --

41:13.115 --> 41:15.916
You have --

41:15.918 --> 41:19.352
¶¶

41:19.354 --> 41:23.090
I was going to say, "You at home
have no idea how scary this is,"

41:23.092 --> 41:26.026
but now I'm changing it to
"You just heard that, right?"

41:26.028 --> 41:30.130
¶¶

41:30.132 --> 41:32.866
ZAK: We all feel fortunate
to have had communication

41:32.868 --> 41:36.269
with so many lost souls
here at the castle.

41:36.271 --> 41:38.238
Did you hear that?

41:38.240 --> 41:41.007
We have experienced
both good and evil,

41:41.009 --> 41:43.844
and we will always have
the residue of these souls

41:43.846 --> 41:46.913
imprinted on us
for eternity.
