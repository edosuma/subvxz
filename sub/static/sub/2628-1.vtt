01:52.519 --> 01:54.385
[NARRATOR]
There's a story that has been

01:54.385 --> 01:56.818
passed down for centuries,

01:56.819 --> 01:58.876
from father to son.

02:00.619 --> 02:03.518
Legend has it a
certain man came

02:03.519 --> 02:06.383
to live in the
village of Gladbury.

02:07.985 --> 02:10.217
He was a good-hearted man,

02:10.219 --> 02:14.311
devoted to his
family and his craft.

02:15.285 --> 02:19.614
The candle maker brought
light to the entire village.

02:20.352 --> 02:23.051
But he longed to give them more.

02:23.052 --> 02:25.384
Life was hard in Gladbury,

02:25.384 --> 02:29.339
and the people had
become disheartened.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.550
[NARRATOR] Night and day,
the candle maker worked,

02:34.551 --> 02:39.506
pouring his heart and
his prayers into each candle.

02:39.718 --> 02:41.784
But on the first
Sunday of Advent,

02:41.785 --> 02:47.351
all he had left to give...
was a single prayer,

02:47.351 --> 02:54.550
not for himself, but for
Gladbury, for his son,

02:54.550 --> 02:58.448
and for all the sons
and daughters to come.

03:00.450 --> 03:06.474
Silence was the only answer
he would receive that night.

03:08.150 --> 03:10.673
Or so it seemed.

04:03.782 --> 04:08.510
[NARRATOR] An angel
blessed a single candle.

04:10.215 --> 04:14.948
The heavenly gift was given
to the ones who needed it most,

04:14.948 --> 04:17.380
with the simple instruction:

04:17.380 --> 04:21.177
Light this and pray.

04:28.014 --> 04:31.646
[NARRATOR] The children
hoped for an answered prayer.

received was a miracle.

the village rejoiced

04:37.614 --> 04:41.047

their change of fortune,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.547

04:43.547 --> 04:47.309
And from them, legends are born.

every twenty-five years,

04:51.447 --> 04:54.380

The Haddington Chandlery,

that revived my faith.

09:07.806 --> 09:11.639

can serve a bowl of soup,

come once every year?

You may have one candle

We give them away. All of them.

And have the
entire village think

34:01.460 --> 34:03.892
they've got the actual
Christmas Candle?

We won't tell them that.

We'll tell them what
this family has told

to light it and pray.

Hello, Charlie.

34:33.159 --> 34:37.818
Why don't we start with the
Gospel of John chapter one.

34:42.391 --> 34:47.091
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

34:47.092 --> 34:49.757
and the Word was God.

34:49.757 --> 34:52.491
The same was in
the beginning with God.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.623
All things were made by him;

34:54.625 --> 34:59.091
and without him was not any
thing made that was made.

34:59.091 --> 35:03.723
In him was life; and the
life was the light of men.

35:03.724 --> 35:06.124
And the light
shineth in darkness;

35:06.124 --> 35:09.920
and the darkness
comprehend it not."

35:15.924 --> 35:19.723
"And the impediment
to his tongue was loosed,

35:19.724 --> 35:22.451
and he spoke plainly."

35:24.323 --> 35:28.914
Now Charlie, we are going
to loose that tongue of yours.

35:29.791 --> 35:31.450
Open wide.

35:33.657 --> 35:34.986

36:29.755 --> 36:32.421
Light this and pray, Charlie.

36:32.422 --> 36:35.115
Even if it's only in your heart.

36:35.321 --> 36:37.150

Good morning, Mr. Finch.

37:00.254 --> 37:02.087
What brings you to our home?

37:02.087 --> 37:05.087
[DAVID] I understand you
have requested the candle.

37:05.087 --> 37:07.985

I might be of service.

could help the old man

Christmas Candle?

Lord himself.

thing as a wasted prayer.

doesn't work, and my husband

01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:28.505
it would've remained hidden.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:31.238
And thankfully, there was just
enough to repair the church

01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:33.004
And to provide for Gladbury's

01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:35.596
impoverished
families that winter.

01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:39.570
The very first
Christmas Candle

01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.765
went to my
great-great-great-grandmother.

01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:49.069
Once she was a
hopeless orphan, and then...

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:58.770
Miracles are part of
our inheritance, Reverend.

01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:00.827
Tell that to Mrs. Hopewell.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.403
I believe you'll find
Mrs. Hopewell': faith to be much

01:04:04.404 --> 01:04:07.665
stronger than the grief
she's feeling now.

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.770
Your doubts don't
trouble me, Reverend.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:17.702
On the contrary,
they inspire my faith.

have a look at this!

01:05:08.901 --> 01:05:12.901
It's a carriage
that pulls itself!

01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:14.890
In all my days...

01:05:20.401 --> 01:05:23.492
Bea! It's Thomas!

Oh, look at you,

That carriage of yours!

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:41.100
It's called a Stanley Steamer,
one of the first of its kind.

01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:43.363
I had it shipped from America.

01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:44.933
[EDWARD] Shall I help you
bring in your luggage?

01:05:44.934 --> 01:05:46.267
[THOMAS] Oh,
I'm not staying, Father.

01:05:46.267 --> 01:05:48.858
Oh, not staying, don't be silly.

01:05:49.267 --> 01:05:50.666
I'm married, Mother.

I'm on the way to
meet her family now.

Oh! And, are you happy?

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.888
I'm finally making a name
for myself, for the family.

Business is expanding,

introduce you to Priscilla.

Why did you come?

I know how much this candle
means to you, to Gladbury,

01:06:35.699 --> 01:06:38.028
but it's lost on me.

01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:43.831
You must light it and pray,
and then you'll see.

See what, Mother?

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:46.599
A miracle?

Gladbury needs you, son.

Merry Christmas.

Thomas, the miracles, the angel,
you saw it with your own eyes.

01:07:12.365 --> 01:07:16.922
I was a child. I saw
what I wanted to see.

01:09:06.394 --> 01:09:08.861
[DAVID] And it came to
pass that a certain

01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:12.027
blind man sat by the
wayside begging,

01:09:12.028 --> 01:09:17.187
He cried, "Jesus, thou Son of
David, have mercy on me."

01:09:17.394 --> 01:09:19.327
And Jesus said unto him,

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:22.260
"What wilt though that
I should do unto thee?"

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.593
The blind man said unto him,

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.826
"Lord, that I might
receive my sight."

01:09:27.827 --> 01:09:33.993
And Jesus said, "Go thy way;
thy faith has made thee whole."

01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:36.693
And immediately
he received his sight

01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:39.591
and followed Jesus in the way.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.593
Did I not say to you
that if you would believe,

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:44.426
You would see the glory of God.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:45.591
And they took away
the stone from the

01:09:45.593 --> 01:09:47.526
place where the
dead man was lying,

01:09:47.526 --> 01:09:50.024
and Jesus lifted up
his eyes and said,

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:52.158
"Father, I thank you
that you have heard..."

01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:54.192
And these are written
that you might believe

01:09:54.193 --> 01:09:57.092
that Jesus is the
Christ, the son of God,

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.426
and that in believing,
you might have life.

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:01.858
Behold there came a leper
and worshipped him,

01:10:01.859 --> 01:10:05.725
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean."

01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:07.026
And Jesus put forth his hand...

01:10:07.026 --> 01:10:09.159
My little daughter is
at the point of death.

01:10:09.159 --> 01:10:12.025
I pray thee, Lord,
come and lay hands on her,

the final candle of Advent,

01:21:02.006 --> 01:21:07.739
the Christ Candle, for only
in Christ do we find the hope,

01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:13.638
love, joy, and peace that we
have come to know this season.

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:18.670
Christmas Eve
holds a special place

01:21:18.671 --> 01:21:21.671
in the heart of every believer,

01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:26.831
and nowhere is this more true
than in the town of Gladbury.

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:34.204
Many of you have no
doubt come to rejoice

01:21:34.204 --> 01:21:36.830
in the miracle of the
Christmas Candle.

01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:41.704
But regretfully,
tonight you shall see this

01:21:41.705 --> 01:21:45.864

come to an end.

to please stand.

[DAVID] Now more than
ever I see the urgent need

01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:33.136
to speak on the virtue
of enduring faith,

01:22:33.136 --> 01:22:34.169
a faith that endures

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.869
disappointment, and
unanswered prayer.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:40.368
A faith that relies not on
the hollow promises of men,

01:22:40.369 --> 01:22:43.062
but on the sovereignty
of Almighty God.

01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:45.700

01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:49.797

[joyful voices]

01:23:05.868 --> 01:23:08.467
I prayed. Every day I prayed,

01:23:08.468 --> 01:23:11.668
And then I woke up this
morning, and I could talk.

01:23:11.668 --> 01:23:14.725
I don't understand it.
I even gave my candle away.

01:23:15.635 --> 01:23:18.067
But my favorite scripture says,

01:23:18.068 --> 01:23:20.835
"With God,
all things are possible."

01:23:20.835 --> 01:23:25.062
Now I'm never going to stop
talking, especially about this!

01:23:25.335 --> 01:23:27.892

but my wife also received
the Christmas Candle.

01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:37.067
For my husband.

01:23:37.068 --> 01:23:40.397
As many of you know,
I was stuck on the bottle.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:43.000
Like never before, I prayed.

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:45.700
And I found I was
drinking less and less.

01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:47.792
Which really is a miracle.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.700

01:23:56.967 --> 01:24:00.365
And now, nothing': lost at all.

01:24:00.633 --> 01:24:03.532

But then, our landlady--

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:15.466
[MRS. FINCH] She forgave
us our debts in full.

01:24:15.466 --> 01:24:17.199
[MR. FINCH] And if
that wasn't enough,

01:24:17.199 --> 01:24:19.399
well I found work
at the Leonard house.

01:24:19.399 --> 01:24:22.332
It makes a man feel good to
provide for his family again.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:26.166
And my wife, she's found
a good friend in Ms. Leonard.

Yes, this dear woman,

01:24:27.399 --> 01:24:29.232

I'm not really a religious man.

01:24:34.066 --> 01:24:38.828
I asked for the candle,
and it's saved my cat.

01:24:39.532 --> 01:24:43.226
It may not seem much, but
she means a great deal to me.

01:24:43.865 --> 01:24:46.331
I never thought I'd get
the Christmas Candle,

01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:47.732
but thank God I did.

for me old man, Oliver Barber.

He was blind.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:58.954
As you may have heard,
dad died this morning.

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:02.365
[DELILAH] And just before
he left us, he whispered,

01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:03.631
"I can see."

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:08.198
"I can see." His prayer was
answered,just as he'd hoped.

01:25:08.198 --> 01:25:10.720
He saw Jesus.

01:25:15.831 --> 01:25:17.997
When I received the candle,

01:25:17.998 --> 01:25:20.731
I thought my prayer'd
be answered one way,

01:25:20.731 --> 01:25:23.330
so I took a step of faith.

01:25:23.331 --> 01:25:26.320
Only it was in
the wrong direction.

01:25:26.531 --> 01:25:29.797
But then I stumbled into
the arms of Hardy Collins,

01:25:29.798 --> 01:25:32.130
the man of my dreams,

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:34.963
and just this morning,
he asked me to be his wife.

received the candle...

01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:06.729
So Reverend, have you changed
your mind about Gladbury?

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:10.127
I'm afraid this has only
confirmed my suspicions.
