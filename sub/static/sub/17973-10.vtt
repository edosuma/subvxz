WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:07.706
Hey, Donna, why you looking
at your trophies all weird

00:07.708 --> 00:09.508
and why do you have
these trophies?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.010
They're second place trophies

00:11.012 --> 00:12.378
from Stoolbend's
Dancing with the Stools.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.812
It's in two weeks,

00:13.814 --> 00:16.115
and this year I refuse to let
your parents beat me again.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.484
It started in 1991.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.687
I remember because I had just...
(speaking gibberish)

00:21.689 --> 00:24.857
GUS:
<i>And the winners of the 1991</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:29.995
Dancing with the Stools Dance
Championships of Dance are...

00:29.997 --> 00:32.097
Freight Train
and Cookie Brown!

00:32.099 --> 00:33.165
(cheering and applause)

00:33.167 --> 00:36.435
Boom!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-Oh!

00:37.270 --> 00:39.138
GUS:
Hello, everyone.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.473
It is now 1998.

00:41.475 --> 00:46.678
Moving on, the winners of this
year's dance competition are...

00:46.680 --> 00:50.949
our very own president
and portly intern,

00:50.951 --> 00:53.786
Freight Train
and Cookie Brown.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.087
Close but no cigar!

00:55.089 --> 00:59.291
Ha ha, that sure is topical
for this period in history!

00:59.293 --> 01:04.997
Freight Train and Cookie Brown!

01:04.999 --> 01:07.099
I told you it was too soon.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.835
I want a divorce.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.038
And then I also lost to Cookie
and Freight Train from 2003

01:13.040 --> 01:15.607
to the present,
which is this year.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.343
And this year,
they're going down.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.112
I'm one step ahead of you.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.346
♪ One...

01:21.348 --> 01:22.948
Ow! Bitch! Ow!

01:22.950 --> 01:24.683

01:24.685 --> 01:25.818
Oh, Lord help me!

01:25.820 --> 01:27.119
Looks bad.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.620
Gonna have to put you down.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.688
Wait, wait.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.691
I think it might be all right.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.326
Yup, yup, it's fine.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.262
Now, keep practicing
while I start dinner.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.135
Donna and I are going to win
that dance contest,

02:16.137 --> 02:17.636
and you know why?

02:17.638 --> 02:21.039
Please don't say it's because
you "be-Cleve" in yourself.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.008
I can't be-Cleve
you just said that.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.009
Nice!

02:24.011 --> 02:25.043
Blech.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.011
Cleveland, I didn't
know you could

02:26.013 --> 02:27.613
so you think you can dance.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.680
He can't.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.682
He can't dance,
can't sing.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.917
He can act, though.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.085
Act like a little bitch.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.620
(laughter)

02:34.622 --> 02:37.022
See you at
the dance contest, Weezie.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.357
Why does he
call you "Weezie"?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.926
Because he thinks that
in a certain light,

02:40.928 --> 02:45.631
I look exactly like Isabel
Sanford from <i>The Jeffersons.</i>

02:45.633 --> 02:49.034
This is why Donna and I can't
use candles in the bedroom.

02:53.139 --> 02:54.106
Hang on a second.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.107
Ah!

02:55.109 --> 02:58.043
Look, I need you
to babysit the kids.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.045
What do you mean you're not
allowed to?

03:00.047 --> 03:02.147
You played the principal
in <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</i>

03:02.149 --> 03:03.715
You're great with kids.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.451
Oh, I hadn't heard.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.820
Well, may God have mercy
on your soul.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.523
Yo, Ro, why don't you babysit?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.159
That way we gots no one hanging
around here blap-blocking us.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.160
You're right.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.663
Mama, I'm 15 years old.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.131
I can babysit Rallo.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.299
Berta, please.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.834
Taking care of a child is
a lot of responsibility.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.971
You were on the Foxy Boxing tour
for half of my childhood.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.639
22-6!

03:27.641 --> 03:28.674
Fine.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.042
I'll be back after rehearsal.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.077
No blapping!

03:35.014 --> 03:36.114
Roberta?

03:36.116 --> 03:37.149
Roberta?

03:37.151 --> 03:37.950
Roberta?

03:37.952 --> 03:39.351
Rallo, leave us alone.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.919
Go play
a video game or something.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.087
Cool.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.522
If you need me,
I'll be warming up some foil

03:43.524 --> 03:45.857
in the microwave
for no reason.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.161
(explosion)

03:49.163 --> 03:50.529
RALLO:
Wasn't me.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.001
And five, six, seven, eight...

03:56.003 --> 03:58.337
Two, three,
kickball, change.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.873
Feather step, feather step,
heel pull back, chassé, chassé,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.943
cha-cha-cha, and heel
and turn and kick and change

04:04.945 --> 04:06.878
and contraposta heel.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.013
Got it?
Got it.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.948
Five, six, seven, eight...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.817
And jump and turn
and shimmy-shimmy sham,

04:11.819 --> 04:14.019
and jump, jump, jump,
fleeble flooble, jumpy jump,

04:14.021 --> 04:16.922
and dance and dance
and dance and dance.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.457
Next.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.425
Hey, Cleveland, I think
you lost something.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.994
I did? What?

04:21.996 --> 04:22.961
A dance competition.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.129
(chuckles)

04:24.131 --> 04:25.931
Mmm, I like
that wit.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.937
Hey, Jew-Z.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.171
Get off my sister.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.007
It's time for her
to give me a bath.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.041
You ain't Charles Barkley.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.776
You can give yourself a bath.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.212
Mama won't let me on account
of that time I slipped

04:40.214 --> 04:42.447
and hit my head and was dead
for three minutes.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.017
Well, Mama's not here
and I'm in charge,

04:45.019 --> 04:46.852
so get up there
and take your bath.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.154
Now, where were we?

04:49.156 --> 04:51.990
On the 8:12 express
to Humpsylvania.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.025
RALLO:
Roberta?

04:53.027 --> 04:54.359
Help!

04:54.361 --> 04:55.627
There are some
problems up here!

04:55.629 --> 04:57.596
Ugh, be right back.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.099
Oops, foot's asleep.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.534
(grunting)

05:03.670 --> 05:05.604
I forgot the order
of how you do this.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.705
(frustrated grunt)

05:11.944 --> 05:13.011
How the hell...

05:13.013 --> 05:15.113
I have to go
to the bathroom.
So go.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.449
Mama always holds me
over the toilet at night.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.216
Why?

05:18.218 --> 05:20.018
Uh, because I don't want

05:20.020 --> 05:23.121
an alligator sneaking up through
the hole and bitin' my doodle.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.623
(groans)

05:24.625 --> 05:27.025
At least somebody
gettin' they doodle bit.

05:31.531 --> 05:32.831
Time for the big lift.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.266
Ready?
Ready.

05:36.002 --> 05:36.968
Ow!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.837
I thought you
were lifting me.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.372
Why would I lift you?

05:40.374 --> 05:41.707
You're stronger.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.141
Are you guys
almost finished?

05:43.143 --> 05:46.044
You promised we'd go to
the buffet at Sizzler after.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.312
Pudding! Croutons!

05:47.314 --> 05:49.514
Sorry, Junior,
but we're not going anywhere

05:49.516 --> 05:51.016
until we get
this routine down.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.117
(sighs)

05:52.119 --> 05:53.151
Dad, it's easy.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.419
Look.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.254
(music starts)
It's a simple promenade,

05:56.256 --> 05:58.590
with a guapacha figure
on the eighth measure.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.096
Cleveland, you're out.

06:04.098 --> 06:04.996
(gasps)

06:04.998 --> 06:07.599
Me and Junior are
winning this contest!

06:07.601 --> 06:11.136
Now I know how Halle Berry
feels every three months.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.138
I'm sorry, honey,
but I consider myself

06:13.140 --> 06:16.141
the LeBron James of regional
Virginia ballroom dancing.

06:16.143 --> 06:19.511
And, well, this Bron-Bron's
gotta ditch Cleveland, too.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.479
Whoo!

06:20.481 --> 06:22.547
Donna, no!
That's anthrax!

06:22.549 --> 06:23.782
What?!

06:23.784 --> 06:25.117
Why do you have anthrax?!

06:25.119 --> 06:26.318
For my feet, Donna!

06:26.320 --> 06:27.919
For my stinky feet!

06:27.921 --> 06:31.189
(screaming, coughing)

06:37.530 --> 06:39.164
And then at rehearsal,

06:39.166 --> 06:41.833
when you transitioned
from a Musette to a Viennese

06:41.835 --> 06:45.303
to a Lindy Hop,
I was like, "What?"

06:45.305 --> 06:48.373
Well, you didn't show it
because you didn't miss a step.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.976
You're like a perfectly
round Baryshnikov.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.612
And you're like
a full-figured Gregory Hines.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.315
Gregory Hines is dead.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.317
Cleveland,
instead of moping around

06:59.319 --> 07:01.586
like a jealous little girl
who can't dance,

07:01.588 --> 07:04.289
why don't you find something
useful to do, like...

07:04.291 --> 07:07.692
uh, marry all the Pert Plus
bottles in the shower.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.027
Okay.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.430
What would you say
if I told you

07:11.432 --> 07:14.266
I took my two best capes,
cut 'em, hemmed 'em,

07:14.268 --> 07:17.035
and bedazzled the bahemus
out of them?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.805
You are a great seamstress.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.006
Seamster.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.009
Huh, what do you call
a male seamstress?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.544
A homosexual.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.312
Are we recycling
these or what?

07:27.314 --> 07:28.313
I don't care.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.748
Do whatever you want.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.951
Pert! Pert!
Pert! Pert!

07:32.953 --> 07:35.987
I'm never washing
my hair again.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.024
Cleveland, is this about me
replacing you with your son

07:39.026 --> 07:40.659
as my partner for
the dance competition?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.294
Are you serious?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.196
Are you really asking me
that question?

07:44.198 --> 07:45.831
What else could it be about?

07:45.833 --> 07:46.932
Well, the Pert.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.100
Of course it's not
about the Pert!

07:49.102 --> 07:50.635
Pert is an effective shampoo

07:50.637 --> 07:53.004
and an intermittently
painful lubricant.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.106
Now, I'm going to enter
that competition

07:55.108 --> 07:57.008
and win it without you!

07:57.010 --> 07:58.643
(laughing)

07:58.645 --> 08:00.645
But Cleveland,
you're a terrible dancer

08:00.647 --> 08:02.013
and you don't
have a partner.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.682
Then I shall find one.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.050
And we will win.

08:05.052 --> 08:08.186
And she and I will dance
on your grave!

08:10.423 --> 08:11.923
I really went too far

08:11.925 --> 08:13.925
with the whole
"dance on your grave" thing.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.761
The competition doesn't mean
that much to me.

08:16.763 --> 08:20.298
Although I am going to find
a partner, and we will win.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.501
And we will dance
on your grave!

08:22.503 --> 08:24.603
Ah, sorry about that.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.109
Do you realize since
I've been watching you

08:31.111 --> 08:33.945
you've gone through
24 pairs of underwear?

08:33.947 --> 08:37.015
Maybe stop giving me a juice
every time I ask for it.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.717
Hey, how about a juice box?

08:38.719 --> 08:39.918
Okay.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.321
(slurps)

08:43.323 --> 08:45.991
Ah...

08:45.993 --> 08:47.492
Twenty-five.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.494
Rallo, you are so dumb!

08:49.496 --> 08:50.962
You are really dumb.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.564
For real.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.502
(grunting)

08:57.504 --> 09:00.539
I think my jeans
shrunk in the wash.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.309
They didn't shrink,
Precious.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.978
All you've been eating all week
is what you make for me--

09:06.980 --> 09:09.681
Pop Tarts, mac and cheese,
chicken strips.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.216
You're porking out,
girl.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.019
That's why all Mom's pants
have elastic in the waist.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.521
Really?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.290
(relieved sigh)

09:18.292 --> 09:19.824
Oh, yeah.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.526
And look, it covers
the whole gut.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.762
Wait, you're wearing
her shirt, too?

09:23.764 --> 09:24.963
It's a one-piece.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.598
Hey, Miss Tubbs,
have you seen Rober...

09:26.600 --> 09:28.433
Oy vey!

09:28.435 --> 09:30.035
Shut your mouth.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.269
Now, I gotta go
scare everybody

09:31.271 --> 09:34.639
by muttering while I pick up
things in the living room.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.108
(muttering):
Damn shoes on the table.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.078
No coaster usin'...
break your neck...

09:41.681 --> 09:43.348
Wow, you were right.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.483
There's so much more
to the world of dance

09:45.485 --> 09:46.952
than just makin' it clap.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.486
That's right, Miss Donna.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.322
And once I finish
this ice cream,

09:50.324 --> 09:52.857
let's krump over to that cannoli
cart for dessert.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.094
Oh, Junior, if you didn't exist,
I'd have to mold you

09:56.096 --> 09:57.862
out of an enormous
piece of clay.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.230

10:01.000 --> 10:05.103
CLEVELAND:
<i>My whole life, I knew if you</i>
<i>needed a dancer in Stoolbend,</i>

10:05.105 --> 10:07.672
there was only one place to go.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.475
<i>But since Dancytown was</i>
<i>destroyed in a fire,</i>

10:10.477 --> 10:13.011
I decided to try Little Moscow.

10:16.382 --> 10:19.718
Excuse me,
are any of you dancers?

10:25.758 --> 10:27.926
You are in Little Moscow.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.828
Everyone is dancer.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.129
Or criminal.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.998
Most are criminal.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.433
Well, how would you
like to be my partner?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.002
I'll pay you, of course.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.336
Is deal.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.938
But is rules.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.841
No kissing on mouth,
no Leningrad Steamer.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.477
No, no, I mean
dance partner.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.646
And then Svetlana
get green card?

10:47.648 --> 10:48.947
Of course!

10:48.949 --> 10:50.949
(chuckles quietly):
No.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.820
(salsa music plays)

10:55.822 --> 10:58.123
Ooh, Junior,
you dance the salsa

10:58.125 --> 11:00.125
as well as you eat it, baby.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.761
Miss Donna, on the
mean streets of Quahog,

11:02.763 --> 11:06.464
you either got a wicked
jump shot, sell rock or dance.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.932
How'd you get so good?

11:07.934 --> 11:10.502
I was kidnapped by Rick James
for three months.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.772
I bet you have a lot
of nice stories.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.176
Wow, Grandpa Freight Train,
are those tap shoes?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.178
Yeah, just a little
something extra

11:20.180 --> 11:22.347
we're putting
into our routine.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.214
Check this out.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.617
(tap shoes clacking)

11:29.655 --> 11:32.157
Look at me go.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.298
We're in trouble,
Miss Donna.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.635
Oh, hello, former partner,
current son,

11:43.637 --> 11:45.003
and occasional father.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.971
Meet my new partner.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.974
Her name is Svetlana
and she's Russian.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.376
So you know
what that means.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.945
She buys sweatsuits in bulk?
No.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.947
She smokes in the shower?
No.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.316
She has a screwdriver wound
on her neck?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.350
In kidney.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.485
No!

12:00.487 --> 12:02.654
It means she's
an amazing dancer.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.523
And check out
her back muscles.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.927
Donna, you want to show her
your weird stretch-marky back?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.862
(laughs)
Just kidding.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.664
No one wants
to see that.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.370
You really want to beat
stretch mark wife at dance?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.372
<i>Sí.</i>

12:21.374 --> 12:24.142
Why you such
male seamstress?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.111
Only one way
to learn dance.

12:26.113 --> 12:30.048
Baseball, chin hairs on

12:38.992 --> 12:42.160

12:42.162 --> 12:44.462
In Russia we have saying:

12:44.464 --> 12:47.098
"If you want to beat wife
in friendly competition,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.034
you commit adultery with
stranger at dance practice."

12:50.036 --> 12:54.038
And has that led
to a vibrant economy?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.141

But... we're in love.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.944
What are you talking about?

13:32.946 --> 13:34.946
We've spent every day
for the past two weeks

13:34.948 --> 13:36.781
locked in each other's arms.

13:36.783 --> 13:37.949
We shared a cannoli.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.185
You took my cannoli.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.287
Oh, Junior, I'm so sorry.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.823
I'm sure I'm to blame for this,
but you need to know that...

13:44.825 --> 13:46.691
(hushes her)

13:46.693 --> 13:48.593
Shh, I get it.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.662
You need time
to process this.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.130
But don't take too long.

Nothing happened
with Svetlana!

14:02.142 --> 14:03.341
We're done.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.376

I'm a married man,

and I have to deal with it.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.848

What? Who cares?

14:12.118 --> 14:13.518
Junior kisses everybody.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.819
He kisses the mailman.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.987
Not on the lips.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.322
Well, if it's a parcel...

You're not hearing me.

Wow.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.765
How could this have happened?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.934
Oh, right, you dumped
your spouse

14:29.936 --> 14:32.804
for your hormonal
teenage stepchild.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.772
What'd you expect,
Woody Allen?

14:34.774 --> 14:38.009
Remember that with him and
Sun-chi or whatevers it was?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.445
Cleveland, what are
we gonna do about this?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.947
We're gonna handle this
the way we make love.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.983
I'm gonna lie back
and do nothing

14:44.985 --> 14:46.517

14:46.519 --> 14:48.453
Okay, fine, you're right.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.121
I should never have dumped you.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.122

14:51.124 --> 14:52.257
I'm sorry.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.358

14:57.330 --> 14:58.663
Talk to Junior

14:58.665 --> 15:00.265

Gilbert Gottfried statue

15:00.267 --> 15:01.332

Rallo put a wad of gum
in my hair,

RALLO:
Gum's out,

to you about...

15:36.937 --> 15:38.202
You're getting
a spray tan?

15:42.676 --> 15:43.841

Donna says that something
happened the other night.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.214

15:50.216 --> 15:53.117
Well, you were gonna find out
sooner or later.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.119
Yes. We kissed.

15:55.121 --> 15:55.954
Twice.

15:55.956 --> 15:56.988
Twice?!

15:56.990 --> 15:58.289
She didn't say that.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.991
Well, she's a class act.

your nose in it.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.059
So Donna Tubbs Brown...

18:50.529 --> 18:52.130
Will you marry me?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.098
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

18:54.100 --> 18:56.601
No, I'm not gonna marry you.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.703
(audience boos)

18:58.705 --> 19:00.538
I'm his stepmother.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.973
(audience exclaims)

19:01.975 --> 19:02.974
Ew!

19:02.976 --> 19:04.775
But we're soulmates.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.611
We're meant to be together.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.112
But Junior,
I don't love you.

19:08.114 --> 19:08.946
(gasps)

19:08.948 --> 19:09.947
(audience boos)

19:09.949 --> 19:11.682
Let me finish.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.051
I don't love you that way.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.987
I love you as a mother.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.121
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

19:17.123 --> 19:19.824
And I think if you look
inside yourself,

19:19.826 --> 19:22.426
you'll realize that
you love me the same way.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.794
Wow.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.931
Maybe because my actual mom
and I were never close,

19:26.933 --> 19:28.499
I got confused.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.801
Aw, Junior.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.104
Come here... son.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.206
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

19:35.208 --> 19:38.843
You know, Miss Donna,
you're a real MILF.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.511
AUDIENCE:
Ew!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.613
"Mom I'd Like as a Friend."

19:42.615 --> 19:44.015
AUDIENCE:
Oh... okay.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.784
Are you gonna dance or what?

19:46.786 --> 19:49.153
Junior, what do you think?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.122
I think we should win
this thing.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.357
As mother and son.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.926
And nothing more.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.897
♪

20:19.484 --> 20:21.786
(audience cheers)

20:21.788 --> 20:23.621
Roberta, we won!

20:23.623 --> 20:25.923
Is what I would have said
if I'd competed.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.191
And won.

20:27.193 --> 20:31.128
But your mother and Junior...
came in fourth.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.130
I'm Captain Naked!

20:33.132 --> 20:33.965
Floppy, floppy,
floppy...

20:33.967 --> 20:35.032
Roberta?!

20:35.034 --> 20:36.834
Ooh, girl,
you're lookin' good!

20:36.836 --> 20:38.302
Well, thanks
for watching Rallo.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.371
Now you can go do whatever
you're gonna do with Federline.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.706
Oh, no!

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
I am not coming within
a country mile of anything

20:44.377 --> 20:45.977
that might give me one of those.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.645
(chuckling)

20:47.647 --> 20:50.181
Yeah, that's what I thought
when I was your age.

20:50.183 --> 20:52.316
Then guys start
growing mustaches

20:52.318 --> 20:54.085
and all your rules
go out the window.

20:55.454 --> 20:59.657
For what it's worth,
I think you'd make a good mom.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.092
<i>Real</i> good.
