WEBVTT

00:05.923 --> 00:08.007
How's he doing?

00:08.090 --> 00:12.262
He has neutropenic fever.
His white blood cell count's stabilised.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.973
He's not getting any worse.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.309
- How you feeling, Jared?
- OK, l guess.

00:17.392 --> 00:20.187
l heard your dad arranged
for a visit from The Rock?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.649
l'm 1 3, l must love wrestling, right?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.943
Come on, The Rock's a movie star.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.780
What could a guy
possibly wanna see more?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.491
Guys, we need an answer.

00:33.325 --> 00:37.371
Name one thing guys wanna see
more than anything in the world?

00:37.454 --> 00:40.457
Louie, we're gonna go with boobs.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.418
Show me boobs.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.546
There they are.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.215
Good job!

00:48.924 --> 00:51.510
l wanna see 'em on a real girl.
A cute girl.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.429
You're cute.

<i>The janitor.
This guy is always bothering me.</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:19.246
<i>Don't look at him,
don't talk to him, don't...</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:24.293
What's your point?
Ammonia too strong?

01:24.376 --> 01:27.045
- No, l have a...
- That's one.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.839
Keep pushin'.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.008
Hey, sport. Got your page.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.052
This better be good.
Paging the Chief of Medicine.

01:34.136 --> 01:38.473
<i>Dr Steadman. Resident
and first-class teacher's pet.</i>

01:42.644 --> 01:46.315
Sir, l was going over
Mr Martinez's chart,

01:46.398 --> 01:51.069
and it seems the TlPS procedure
he's scheduled for is unnecessary.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.197
Why unnecessary?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.948
He's dead.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.495
Excellent catch, Dr...

02:01.246 --> 02:02.915
Dr...

02:02.998 --> 02:05.334
<i>Dorian! You see me every day.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:08.127
<i>- Say my name. Say it!
- Martinez.</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:10.506
That was the name
of the patient, sir.

02:10.589 --> 02:14.051
- Avery.
- That's the clipboard manufacturer.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.805
<i>- Fine work, doctor. Fine work.
- I hear that.</i>

02:18.889 --> 02:22.184
Ammonia's a little strong today.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.812
That's two.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.026
Steady, boy.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.820
Now, Rowdy.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.451
- When you're not here, he does it.
- l'm sure. He's shy.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.287
l think you should go ahead
and do it.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.165
- l am not flashing my breasts.
- lt's easy.

02:45.249 --> 02:49.419
- You just go like this.
- That's hot.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.465
l went by paediatrics.

02:53.549 --> 02:57.511
- They thought it was funny.
- l'm borrowing a sweatshirt.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.225
What did we agree you would do
whenever l left a room?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.603
- l'm sorry, baby.
- That's better.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.947
My man Turk is getting it daily,
nightly and ever-so-rightly.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.116
What up, dawg!

03:19.199 --> 03:22.327
<i>Once every 4.2 seconds,
a man says something stupid</i>

03:22.411 --> 03:26.707
<i>that a woman hears and punishes him for.
This wasn't one of those times.</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:30.252
What did you just say?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.045
What up, dawg?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.631
Why would you think we'd slept together?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.009
Because l'm a nurse?
Because l'm Latina?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.887
Because you guys
have been dating for a while.

03:39.970 --> 03:44.349
Do Latina women put out more?
That's not something l've heard.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.936
- Turk told me.
- No! l didn't! He assumed.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.105
And did you correct him?

03:50.189 --> 03:53.567
l've been really busy
at the hospital lately.

03:54.818 --> 03:59.364
ls that how you see this relationship?
As some mad dash to the finish line?

03:59.448 --> 04:02.075
l'll take you into that bedroom now

04:02.159 --> 04:05.495
and you will be walking sideways
for the rest of your life,

04:05.579 --> 04:10.125
because l will have used all your up
and down. Now, is that what you want?

04:10.209 --> 04:11.960
- No.
- Good.

04:12.044 --> 04:16.048
Because what l want is for this
to be a real relationship.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.468
l want us to know each other
better than we know ourselves.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.304
- Wow.
- That's right, ''wow''.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.934
So if you really want me ''daily and
nightly and ever-so-rightly'',...

04:27.017 --> 04:29.144
That sounds like
something you'd say.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.605
...show me you know me.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.944
l think you should
let the kid meet the ladies.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.989
You're the one who told
Kelso that Mr Martinez was dead?

04:41.073 --> 04:45.077
<i>- That's terrific work.
- Looks like word gets around.</i>

04:45.160 --> 04:49.706
<i>What in the name of Are You There, God?
It's Me, Margaret were you thinking?</i>

04:49.790 --> 04:55.462
l'm certain invasive vascular procedures
have a low success rate on dead people.

04:55.546 --> 04:59.925
That TlPS procedure
was for Mrs Blitt down in 1 03.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.553
You see, she doesn't have insurance.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.430
But Mr Martinez had great insurance.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.934
Should l talk slower or get a nurse
who speaks fluent Moron?

05:09.017 --> 05:14.106
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- What do you want from me?

05:29.162 --> 05:33.250
l don't know if they taught you this
in the land of puppy-dog tails

05:33.333 --> 05:37.379
where you obviously, if not grew up,
then spent most of your summers,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.340
but you're in the real world now.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.847
<i>- Don't say it.
- l still think l was right.</i>

05:46.930 --> 05:50.017
<i>Once every 6.3 seconds,
a man says something stupid</i>

05:50.100 --> 05:54.062
<i>that another man hears and punishes
him for. Luckily, this wasn't...</i>

05:54.146 --> 05:56.231
<i>- That's it!
- Oh, no.</i>

05:56.315 --> 06:00.986
Do you know what this is?
This is me washing my hands of you.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.781
l will not be in the same room
with you again, starting...

06:05.699 --> 06:06.742
now.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.338
Tissue?

06:19.421 --> 06:20.797
<i>It's a challenge...</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:22.841
<i>Little bit of flow, like...</i>

06:22.925 --> 06:25.844
<i>''Fighting Joe'' Hooker...</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:31.975
<i>I don't need Dr Cox. Big jerk.</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:34.144
<i>I hate him.</i>

06:36.772 --> 06:41.109
Hey, sport.
Or should l say howdy, Mr Pouty?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.903
lt's been a rough day.

06:42.986 --> 06:48.033
So l hear. Well, anyway,
l'm very proud of you, Dr...

06:48.116 --> 06:50.202
<i>Just look at my badge.</i>

06:50.285 --> 06:51.662
Dr Turk.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.249
This is my roommate's badge.
We must have switched...

06:55.332 --> 06:59.586
That's a great anecdote. You should
write that down in your journal.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.798
Then your kids can read about it
when you're dead.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.050
- They're waiting for us...
- ln a moment.

07:05.133 --> 07:10.264
lf you go easy on the stories, l'd love
you to join me for golf tomorrow.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.183
- That'd be terrific, sir.
- Super.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.447
You wanna show a woman you know her,
buy her a little something.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.284
None of my patients are improving.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.453
- l'm gonna buy her flowers.
- Yeah!

07:33.537 --> 07:36.123
Please, been done to death.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.543
l don't get it.
l do everything by the book.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.463
Maybe that's the problem.
You approach things too clinically.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.883
How about chocolates?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.343
With rich clichÃ© centres?

07:48.427 --> 07:51.013
Have you ever treated your patients

07:51.096 --> 07:54.766
with something other
than traditional medicine?

07:54.850 --> 07:58.061
l'm gonna buy her a really nice pen.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.648
No, she loves to write.
She handwrites all of her letters

08:01.732 --> 08:05.569
because she says e-mail's
too impersonal. That's perfect.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.780
- A pen is good.
- Yeah!

08:13.327 --> 08:18.207
All l gotta do is find time to get
out of here and maybe l'll buy her one.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.920
All l'm saying is there's more
to healing than what's in the books.

08:23.003 --> 08:28.175
l talk to my patients. l sing
to them, ask what their hobbies are,

08:28.258 --> 08:31.762
and tell them ghost stories
about an old sea captain.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.808
Thought you'd be interested
in that kid Jared's chart.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.981
Look at that white blood cell count.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.943
And all it took
was a visit from The Rock.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.403
The Rock was here
and nobody told me?

08:48.487 --> 08:53.033
- The Rock couldn't make it.
- Well, somebody did something.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.292
<i>It felt weird knowing Dr Cox and I would
never be working in the same room again.</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:04.002
Check her LFTs and coags.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.005
<i>Every time I think something,
the opposite happens.</i>

09:07.089 --> 09:09.132
<i>I'm not having sex this weekend.</i>

09:09.216 --> 09:11.009
You're cute.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.138
Who's the present from?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.559
- My boyfriend.
- When did he give it to you?

09:18.642 --> 09:23.480
<i>He's pretending yesterday didn't happen.
If he thinks I'll forgive him...</i>

09:23.564 --> 09:26.316
The reason l was
bent out of shape yesterday...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.986
- l accept!
- Don't interrupt me. Come here.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.781
Pull that curtain.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.411
Mrs Blitt over there needs
the TlPS procedure, no insurance.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.705
She can now look forward
to a lifetime

09:39.788 --> 09:44.042
of encephalopathy and jaundice
thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.

09:44.126 --> 09:47.921
- ls he really that bad?
- l hate Robert Kelso.

09:48.005 --> 09:52.217
l hate his family, friends, the guy
that cleans his racist lawn jockey.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.888
l hate anybody who even associates
with him. ls that clear?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.558
Totally.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.106
Call me.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.984
Elliot, check out these ass slides.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.322
How's that stuff even get up there?

10:13.405 --> 10:14.740
l fell on it.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.200
l fell on it.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.576
l fell on it.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.245
l was bored.

10:20.329 --> 10:24.374
The doctors in the ER have a box
where they keep all this junk.

10:24.458 --> 10:29.671
- Next to the Lost and Found Box?
- There's no Lost and Found Box.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.090
There's an Ass Box.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.637
- That's not Carla's pen?
- l had no time to shop!

10:46.605 --> 10:49.483
Beautiful day for golf, sports?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.652
Yes, sir, Dr Kelso.

10:52.361 --> 10:56.990
l don't know what you're trying to pull,
but l am not a guy you wanna mess with.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.076
Steadman, l need a tee.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.162
A tee, or some tea, sir?
Because l've brought both.

11:02.246 --> 11:06.250
<i>It's just a friendly game of golf
with a couple of guys from work.</i>

11:06.333 --> 11:10.212
Excellent, our fourth has arrived.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.548
What's up, Newbie?

11:25.936 --> 11:29.565
<i>He's got nothing to say.
After all, he's here too.</i>

11:29.648 --> 11:32.734
- l thought you hated Kelso.
- l do.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.737
And watching his face
as l kick his worthless butt

11:35.821 --> 11:40.075
up and down this golf course every week,
is basically...

11:40.158 --> 11:45.122
lt's the most fun l can have
without having to cuddle afterwards.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.584
Good night, lrene!
Fantastic golf shot, sir.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.004
Real nice length.
Now, does your husband happen to play?

11:53.463 --> 11:56.466
But, no,
l'm not a hypocrite for being here.

11:56.550 --> 12:01.180
What's your pathetic excuse,
you whiny little suck-up?

12:01.263 --> 12:05.142
<i>Ignore him.
Just let your game do all the talking.</i>

12:09.354 --> 12:11.356
That'll play.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.867
Don't open it!
Please, don't open it!

12:21.950 --> 12:27.456
Since we've been chatting, maybe you
could raise your heart rate for me?

12:32.336 --> 12:34.963
What am l doing? This is stupid.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.570
Don't make her open it.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.492
Are you that busy?

13:03.575 --> 13:07.538
You do know me.
Sweetie, l love this!

13:09.414 --> 13:12.334
lt's so, it's so cool. lt's cool.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.004
- l'm woozy.
- You're fine.

13:16.088 --> 13:19.591
Today's the day l finally beat
his uppity, insubordinate...

13:19.675 --> 13:22.553
Great shot, doctor!

13:22.636 --> 13:26.098
You see, l always say
keep your friends close

13:26.181 --> 13:28.267
and your enemies closer.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.856
Can you believe him?
You're away and yet he hit first.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.692
- lt's a technicality.
- But there's the rub.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.902
The rules are there for a reason.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.822
lf you break one,
why not break them all?

13:54.376 --> 13:57.087
Before medicine ever became a business,

13:57.171 --> 14:00.757
the only rule
was to do your best to help the patient.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.427
Like it or not,
medicine is a business.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.889
lf the hospital shuts down,
then who are we helping then?

14:08.348 --> 14:11.727
So, only people with money
deserve medical treatment?

14:13.103 --> 14:14.605
Dammit!

14:14.688 --> 14:17.065
lt's about what's best for the hospital.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.237
lt's about what's best for the patient.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.999
The only reason l go back
to that hospital day after day

14:34.082 --> 14:37.294
is because l care
about those patients.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.463
Every one of 'em.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.468
You've got a lot of potential, sport.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.970
You stick with me

14:47.054 --> 14:50.807
and you're going to be climbing
the ladder very quickly.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.143
lsn't that what you want?

14:54.853 --> 14:57.356
You have to sink this
for the win, Cox.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.525
Newbie, l almost forgot.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.986
l'm gonna get Mrs Blitt
her TlPS procedure tomorrow,

15:03.070 --> 15:06.323
with or without insurance,
and l want you to help me.

15:07.407 --> 15:14.248
Now tell me, do you have the stones
to sink a putt when you have to?

15:21.547 --> 15:24.424
See you next Wednesday.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.345
l love this game.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.390
l can't decide if l should help Cox.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.853
At least you didn't give your girlfriend
a gift that used to be inside someone.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.021
That's true.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.816
l have magic breasts.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.571
How many has she had?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.366
Almost one.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.743
You know what,
Cox doesn't need your help

15:51.827 --> 15:55.038
taking her down
for a TlPS procedure.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.292
He shouldn't even be
putting you in that situation.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.044
- You're right.
- Hell, yeah, l'm right!

16:01.128 --> 16:03.213
Screw Cox.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.675
- Not afraid of him, are you?
- Hell, no!

16:07.843 --> 16:09.928
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

16:13.056 --> 16:15.434
- That's four.
- That's three.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.019
That's five.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.858
All righty, we're through here.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.235
- Somebody call it.
- Wait.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.784
Right. Time of death, 6.20.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.168
Hey. There's my buppy.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.545
Did you just say ''buppy''?

16:43.629 --> 16:46.340
Cos that's not gonna work for me.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.010
Carla, we gotta talk.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.347
We can talk later.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.060
Later's good.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.772
Let's just worry about
getting you better. OK, gorgeous?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.816
<i>I decided Cox was wrong.</i>

17:04.900 --> 17:09.029
<i>There's room to play by the rules
and care about the patients.</i>

17:09.112 --> 17:13.325
Do a wallet biopsy on her, and
if the insurance doesn't check out,

17:13.407 --> 17:18.163
l want her in the nursing home before
she can gum down a single fruit cup.

17:18.247 --> 17:22.166
<i>That was when I realised
how Dr Kelso truly saw these people.</i>

17:25.420 --> 17:28.590
<i>Could I have a price check
on a 7 4-year-old female</i>

17:28.674 --> 17:30.759
<i>with prerenal azotemia?</i>

17:30.843 --> 17:32.928
Bag her.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.477
Come on,
l wanna show you something.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.646
Wait. lt's about the pen.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.066
l thought a really nice one
would be a great gift,

17:46.149 --> 17:50.487
and l see a great one...
in the Lost and Found Box.

17:50.571 --> 17:54.366
There is no Lost and Found Box.
There's an Ass Box...

17:54.449 --> 17:56.577
Yeah, there is.

18:01.957 --> 18:05.544
And you were this close
to getting everything you wanted.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.880
l assume this is what you wanted.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.339
Yes.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.885
And yet you tell me
that your thoughtful token of love

18:12.968 --> 18:16.054
wasn't a token of love at all.
lt was an ass pen.

18:17.514 --> 18:21.476
You come home and tell me this
because being open and honest

18:21.560 --> 18:24.771
is more important to you
than having sex with me?

18:29.401 --> 18:31.570
Are you coming or what?

18:32.362 --> 18:33.697
Hell, yeah.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.040
Stay, Rowdy, stay.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.375
lt took me three hours to realise...

18:45.459 --> 18:47.628
- Excuse me, miss.
- Can l help you?

18:47.711 --> 18:50.964
l'm afraid l have an awful case
of the gotta-see-'ems.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.677
That's not even a real disease.

18:55.761 --> 18:58.180
At what point
did l become a crazy person?

18:58.263 --> 19:01.099
Come on.
Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy

19:01.183 --> 19:03.268
might have been a tad unorthodox,

19:03.352 --> 19:05.771
and it might be hard to live down.

19:07.356 --> 19:10.442
- l'm waiting for the ''but''.
- So's everyone else.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.110
That's not funny.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.405
- Thanks. Glad l shared.
- Come on.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.950
When l look at you, l look at a doctor

19:18.033 --> 19:20.702
who will do whatever it takes
to help a patient.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.579
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.623
<i>And on that note...</i>

19:24.706 --> 19:26.834
lf you still want my help,
l'm on board.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.753
lt's way too big of a risk for a peon.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.798
l just wanted to see
what team you were playing for.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.300
<i>- So it was all a test.
- Besides,</i>

19:36.343 --> 19:39.847
- l already did it.
- Cox!

19:39.930 --> 19:42.349
Run, Junior. Daddy's home.

19:43.684 --> 19:47.145
Did you think
l wouldn't find out what you did?

19:47.229 --> 19:49.231
- What did l do?
- You insolent...

19:49.314 --> 19:50.482
l'm insolent?

19:50.566 --> 19:54.695
<i>I know it sounds melodramatic,
but as I watched the two of them,</i>

19:54.778 --> 19:59.908
<i>they weren't battling for patients
or insurance, but for my soul.</i>

19:59.992 --> 20:02.661
- She needed the TlPS...
- l've got you this time.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.454
l can taste it!

20:04.538 --> 20:09.710
<i>It's an old story, really.
Good versus bad. Right versus wrong.</i>

20:09.793 --> 20:12.504
<i>The dark side versus the light.</i>

20:17.885 --> 20:22.389
l've been waiting
for this moment all my life.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.774
Easy, Chewie.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.699
l'll teach you
to respect this institution.

20:41.909 --> 20:44.828
l hope you learn from this.

20:46.747 --> 20:47.789
No!

20:51.752 --> 20:55.631
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.

21:02.471 --> 21:07.559
Well, sport. lt looks like
a permanent spot just opened up

21:07.643 --> 21:09.561
on the golf course.

21:09.645 --> 21:13.273
How does joining the Chief of Medicine
for a weekly round sound?

21:13.357 --> 21:15.526
l'm not really that into golf.

21:15.609 --> 21:20.531
l guess that's your choice,
isn't it, Dr Dorian?

21:22.157 --> 21:24.785
<i>I liked it better
when he didn't know my name.</i>

21:27.287 --> 21:29.331
That's one for me.

21:35.254 --> 21:36.296
That's two.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.714
l'm hurt.
