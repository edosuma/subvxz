00:11.959 --> 00:13.458

00:13.458 --> 00:14.959
- HE CALLS ME YOKO.

00:14.959 --> 00:16.375
- HE DOESN'T CALL YOU YOKO.

00:16.375 --> 00:19.417
- EVERY TIME HE SEES ME,
HE SOMEHOW MANAGES

00:19.417 --> 00:22.834
TO WORK THE WORD "ONO"
INTO THE CONVERSATION.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.542
- OH, NO.

00:24.542 --> 00:27.500

FROM THAT TIM GUY,

00:27.500 --> 00:29.417
AND I RAN THEM PAST LEGAL.

00:29.417 --> 00:30.625

00:32.834 --> 00:34.000
- BLOODY HELL.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.625
- HE WANTS TO RUN THE SHOW
WITH YOU.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE THIS GO AWAY?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.000
- SO DID I.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.208
- IF YOU MAINTAIN
YOUR CURRENT RATE OF SPENDING,

00:41.208 --> 00:44.625
YOU'LL RUN OUT OF MONEY
BY THE TIME YOU GET HERE.

00:44.625 --> 00:47.291

PAYING YOUR TAXES

01:59.834 --> 02:01.125

02:01.125 --> 02:03.041

I SIGNED THE RETURNS.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.166
I SIGNED THE CHECKS.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.875

NO, NOT THE PLANE.

- OH, THE PLANE'S
NOT EVEN A QUESTION.

02:26.583 --> 02:30.291

02:52.375 --> 02:54.125
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO,
I THINK IT COULD BE

02:54.125 --> 02:56.041
VERY LUCRATIVE FOR BOTH OF US.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.709
- WHAT?

03:04.834 --> 03:06.875
- IT WAS GOOD, RIGHT?
- GOOD ENOUGH.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.125

FROM THAT ONE TAPE

04:17.583 --> 04:20.500
- THAT'S THE WORST TOAST EVER.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.417
SERIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT'S A BIT UNTENABLE.

04:24.417 --> 04:25.959
- NOT TO ME.

04:25.959 --> 04:28.083
BUT SINCE I WAS PART
OF THIS PROJECT FIRST,

04:28.083 --> 04:30.250
IF YOU  WANT TO STEP ASIDE,

04:30.250 --> 04:33.792
I WOULD TOTALLY SUPPORT THAT.

- WELL,
I'M NOT STEPPING ANYWHERE.

RIGHT?

04:42.834 --> 04:44.333
- I DID.
- WHAT?

04:44.333 --> 04:47.750
- HONESTLY,
WE CAN'T ALL DO IT TOGETHER.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.041
YOU KNOW THAT.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.750

04:53.375 --> 04:57.208

OFF A WALL.

BEVERLY.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.375
- I WISH.
HE'S SEAN'S EX-PARTNER.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.875
OH, GOD, IT'S TOO UPSETTING
TO EVEN TALK ABOUT.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.333
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO MEET HIM.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.542
- YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
NOT MEET HIM.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.083
- IF HE'S GONNA BE PART
OF THE SHOW...

07:04.083 --> 07:07.000
- HOPEFULLY
A VERY, VERY SMALL PART.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.375
- UH-HUH.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.417
- SEAN AND I ARE TRYING
TO KEEP HIS INVOLVEMENT

07:10.417 --> 07:12.667
TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.250
- MM.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.917
- I AM BEGGING YOU,
DO NOT MEET WITH HIM.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.417
IT WILL ONLY INFLATE

07:18.417 --> 07:20.417
HIS ALREADY RIDICULOUS
SENSE OF IMPORTANCE.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.375
- GREAT.
WE'LL SET UP A MEETING.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.792
TALK TO YOU LATER.
BYE-BYE.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.417

A LITTLE STRESSED, BUD.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.750

YOU THINK?

07:31.750 --> 07:33.125
- THE PENZEL THING?

07:33.125 --> 07:35.208
- IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT STORM,

07:35.208 --> 07:36.792
IF THE STORM WAS MADE OF SHIT.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.917
- WELL, IF IT'S ANY HELP,
LUNCH IS ON ME.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.500
- LUNCH IS ALWAYS ON YOU.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.458
WHAT'D HELP IS A JOB.
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE?

07:42.458 --> 07:43.875
- [chuckling]
HEY, I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.166
- YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER
PULL SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR ASS.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.166
- WHAT MAGIC SHOWS
DID YOU GO TO?

07:48.166 --> 07:50.083
- YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.750
- NOT NOTHING.
THINGS COME YOUR WAY.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.208
BUT I TRY TO BE SELECTIVE.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.750
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME
WITH SHIT.

07:54.750 --> 07:58.083
- WASTE MY TIME.
TELL ME.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.959
- OKAY, THERE'S A THING
I JUST GOT A CALL ON.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.417
- YEAH?

08:02.417 --> 08:04.000
- NORMALLY,
I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK

08:04.000 --> 08:06.166
OF BRINGING THIS TO YOU.
- BRING IT. WHAT'S THE SHOW?

08:06.166 --> 08:07.625
- NOT A SHOW.
- MOVIE?

08:07.625 --> 08:09.875
- NOT EXACTLY.
IT'S...

08:09.875 --> 08:11.500
A PARTY.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.792
- ARE YOU SHITTING ME?
YOU'RE BRINGING ME A PARTY?

08:13.792 --> 08:15.291
- SEE, THIS IS WHY
I SCREEN STUFF.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.291
- [sighs]
WHAT KIND OF PARTY?

08:18.291 --> 08:20.125
- IT'S A BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR THE HEAD OF STATE

08:20.125 --> 08:21.750
OF A COUNTRY IN CENTRAL ASIA.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.375
HE'S TURNING 50,
AND HE'S OFFERING

08:23.375 --> 08:26.417
TO PAY $500,000
FOR YOU TO BE THERE.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.917
- HALF A MILLION
TO SHOW UP AT A PARTY?

08:28.917 --> 08:30.291
- YEP.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.250
- WHY WOULD YOU NOT
BRING ME THIS?

08:32.250 --> 08:36.083
- UM, HIS REGIME
IS SOMEWHAT IFFY...

08:36.083 --> 08:37.333
TORTURE-WISE.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.458
- HUH.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.542
- YOU EVER HEARD OF KHARAKISTAN?
- NO.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.166
- HE'S THE "BUTCHER"
OF KHARAKISTAN.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.583
- AND HE WANTS ME
AT HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY?

08:44.583 --> 08:46.834
- APPARENTLY
HE'S A HUGE FRIENDS  FAN.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.917
LOVES THE SHOW.
JOEY'S HIS FAVORITE.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.417
- AW.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.041
- NOW, KEEP IN MIND,
HE'S WIDELY CONSIDERED

08:52.041 --> 08:54.333
TO BE AMONG THE WORST DICTATORS
ON THE PLANET.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.125
- OKAY.
- HE'S A WAR CRIMINAL.

08:56.125 --> 08:59.166
HE'S BEEN ACCUSED
OF UNSPEAKABLE ATROCITIES.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.709
ON THE PLUS SIDE,

09:00.709 --> 09:03.875
HE WOULD SEND
HIS PRIVATE PLANE FOR YOU.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.291
- HMM.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.333
- ALSO, YOU CAN BRING
AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.041
- SO WHO ELSE IS GOING
TO THIS THING?

09:09.041 --> 09:11.375
- THEY'VE REACHED OUT
TO A NUMBER OF OUR CLIENTS.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.041
- LIKE WHO?
- I CAN'T SAY...

09:13.041 --> 09:15.041
JUST LIKE I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE
THAT YOU WERE GOING.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.291
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.041
WOULD I BE
THE BIGGEST NAME THERE?

09:18.041 --> 09:20.750
- MM, PROBABLY IN TELEVISION.
- SO FEATURE PEOPLE?

09:20.750 --> 09:22.417
- OH, YEAH.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.458
HE IS SPENDING MILLIONS
ON THIS THING.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.125
HE'S GOT OPRAH'S PARTY PLANNER.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.458
THEY'RE FLYING IN CHANDELIERS
FROM AUSTRIA.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.709
- WOW.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.875
- ON THE OTHER HAND--
FULL DISCLOSURE--

09:31.875 --> 09:33.583
HE KILLED 11,000 PEOPLE...

09:33.583 --> 09:34.875
IN JANUARY.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.041
- THIS JANUARY?
- YES.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.917
- GOT YA.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.750
WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO DO
AT THIS THING?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.083
- JUST SHOW UP,
SCHMOOZE A LITTLE.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.083
THERE MIGHT BE A GROUP OF YOU
SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.333
- WHAT LANGUAGE?

09:48.333 --> 09:51.750
- OH, ENGLISH.
HE WENT TO B.U.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.166
- SO HOW ARE THINGS COMING
WITH THE SHOW?

09:54.166 --> 09:55.750
- AH, TERRIFIC.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.875
I'VE BEEN TO HOLLAND TWICE
TO SEE HOW THEY DO IT.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.583
- WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.166
- YOU EVER BEEN?
- NO, NO.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.458
DID YOU GET TO SEE THE TULIPS?
- [chuckles]

10:03.458 --> 10:05.083
YOU CAN'T FUCKING MISS
THE TULIPS.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.917
IT'S LIKE YELLOW TULIPS,
RED TULIPS, PURPLE TULIPS.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.083
ENOUGH WITH THE TULIPS.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.750
WE GET IT.
YOU'RE HOLLAND.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.417
- SURE.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.875
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,
TULIPS AND HOOKERS.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.291
[chuckles]
- RIGHT. OKAY.

10:17.291 --> 10:21.208
SO, UH, WE GOT YOUR LIST
OF POTENTIAL HOSTS.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.417
- GREAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:23.417 --> 10:26.709
- WELL, UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.834
BERT CONVY IS DEAD.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.125

10:30.125 --> 10:31.959
NO. WHEN?

10:31.959 --> 10:33.750
- UM, 1991.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.792
- OH, WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.750
HE'D HAVE BEEN GREAT.
- YEAH.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.125
ALSO, RICHARD DAWSON IS DEAD.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.458

10:41.458 --> 10:42.959

10:42.959 --> 10:45.208
ON SESAME STREET.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.125
- [sighs]
WOW.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.166
CLEARLY GOOGLE
IS NOT MY FRIEND.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.250
- CLEARLY.
[both laugh]

10:50.250 --> 10:52.041
SO WE'LL NEED A NEW LIST.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.208
- YOU GOT IT.
AND NOBODY DEAD.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.166
- THAT WOULD HELP.
[both laugh]

10:56.166 --> 10:59.250
ALL RIGHTY.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.125
- SO HOW'S IT GOING HERE
WITH HELEN?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.083
- OH, SHE'S TERRIFIC.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.417
- YEAH?
YOU LIKE WORKING UNDER HER?

11:04.417 --> 11:06.000
OR ARE YOU ON TOP?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.792
- WHAT?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.291
- "WHAT?"

11:09.291 --> 11:11.667
- [laughs]
I-I DON'T--

11:11.667 --> 11:13.667
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU GOT THAT, BUT--

11:13.667 --> 11:15.417
- FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

11:15.417 --> 11:16.875
BUT FYI...
[clicks tongue]

11:16.875 --> 11:20.583
GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT IS ONE HUNK OF WOMAN.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.625
- OH.
CAN WE PLEASE DROP THIS?

11:22.625 --> 11:23.917
- IT'S DROPPED.
IT'S DROPPED.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.333
I JUST GET A KICK
OUT OF KNOWING

11:25.333 --> 11:27.333
THAT YOU AND I DRANK
FROM THE SAME WELL.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.083
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:29.083 --> 11:31.083
- AH, I'M SORRY
I EVEN SAID ANYTHING.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.709
- YOU AND HELEN?

11:32.709 --> 11:34.500
- YEAH, IT WAS BACK
WHEN SHE WORKED FOR ME.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.250
IT WAS JUST ONE NIGHT,
BUT OOH.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.500
SHE'S A WILD ONE

11:38.500 --> 11:41.667
WITH THAT LITTLE SWASTIKA
DOWN THERE.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.208
- WHAT?
- COME ON, YOU KNOW.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.583
THAT LITTLE SWASTIKA TATTOO?

11:46.583 --> 11:48.333
- THAT'S A FLOWER.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.583
- OH.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.959
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY DARK,

11:50.959 --> 11:52.417
AND I HADN'T HAD MY LASIK YET.

11:52.417 --> 11:54.834
- YEAH, NOT A SWASTIKA.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.375
- THAT'S A RELIEF.
[chuckles]

11:56.375 --> 11:59.834
I GOT TO SAY, IT MADE ME
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.750
- THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION
IS MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.583
- FUNNY, 'CAUSE IT'S MAKING ME
A LITTLE HOT.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.667
- IT'S NOT HOT.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.667
- IT'S KIND OF HOT.
- NO.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.917
- COME ON, IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THE THREE OF US WERE TOGETHER.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.709
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
- IT'S SORT OF LIKE THAT.

12:11.709 --> 12:13.041
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.500
- TELL THAT TO
WHAT'S IN MY HEAD.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.375
- I CAN'T CONTROL
THE SHIT IN THERE.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.834
- NO, YOU CANNOT.
- WELL, THANKS FOR COMING IN.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.959
- MY PLEASURE.
[chuckles]

12:20.959 --> 12:23.333
AND I MEAN THAT.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.792
- THEY'RE SAYING I CAN BRING
ANYONE I WANT.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.792
- WELL, THIS IS EXCITING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.834
- AND HE'S FLYING US THERE
ON HIS PRIVATE PLANE?

12:34.834 --> 12:36.291
- HE'S A FAN.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.000
- I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF THIS COUNTRY.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.417
- IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
IT'S A WHOLE THREE-DAY THING.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.166
THERE'S OPTIONAL TOURS
TO, LIKE, ANCIENT TEMPLES,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.500
OR YOU CAN VISIT
A URANIUM MINE.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.959
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

12:47.959 --> 12:50.709
- ARE YOU AWARE THAT THIS MAN
IS A MASS MURDERER?

12:50.709 --> 12:53.959
- UH, YEAH, I'VE HEARD
SOME MIXED THINGS.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.542
- LET ME SEE.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.625
- HE HAS KILLED HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.917
- SO I GUESS THE PARTY
WON'T BE TOO CROWDED.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.875
- JESUS CHRIST, HE SLAUGHTERED
11,000 PEOPLE IN--

13:04.875 --> 13:06.917
- IN JANUARY.
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

13:06.917 --> 13:10.750
- HOW CAN YOU GO TO
THIS MURDERER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.083
- WHO'S HAVING A PARTY?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.959
- ACCORDING TO THE HAGUE,

13:13.959 --> 13:17.375
HIS REGIME IS SECOND ONLY
TO NORTH KOREA

13:17.375 --> 13:18.750
IN ITS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.792
- OH, YOU GOT INVITED TO THAT?
- UH-HUH.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.375
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING THIS?

13:24.375 --> 13:26.500
IT'S ENDORSING EVIL.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.291
IT'S MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.291
- IT'S THREE DAYS.
- HOW MUCH ARE YOU GETTING?

13:30.291 --> 13:32.166
- $500,000.
- NICE.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.917
- HE'S PAYING YOU?
YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.166
THAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE.
- OR BETTER.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.125
- GOD, TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.709
I ONLY GOT $30,000 FOR GOING
TO IDI AMIN'S CHRISTMAS PARTY.

13:40.709 --> 13:41.875
- HANG ON.

13:41.875 --> 13:44.750
YOU SPENT CHRISTMAS
WITH IDI AMIN?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.208
- WELL, NOT JUST ME.

13:46.208 --> 13:49.583
IT WAS ME, HERVE VILLECHAIZE,
YUL BRYNNER,

13:49.583 --> 13:51.917
ANGIE DICKINSON, AND EVA GABOR.

13:51.917 --> 13:54.542
- GOD, I HAD SUCH A THING
FOR ANGIE DICKINSON.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.458
- SO DID IDI,
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

13:56.458 --> 13:58.000
THAT GUY WAS HANDSY.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.166
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
HE'LL BE REMEMBERED FOR.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.875
- THEY ARE PAYING YOU $500,000?

14:03.875 --> 14:05.709
- PLUS A PARTY.

14:05.709 --> 14:08.000
- LOOK, I REALIZE YOU'RE
IN A TOUGH POSITION FINANCIALLY,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.542
BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY NO TO THIS.

14:09.542 --> 14:12.083
IT IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.417
- OKAY, LET'S--

14:13.417 --> 14:15.166
OKAY, LET'S SAY I DON'T GO.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.333
WHAT'S THAT
GONNA ACCOMPLISH, HUH?

14:17.333 --> 14:20.333
DOES IT SAVE ONE VILLAGE
FROM BEING SLAUGHTERED?

14:20.333 --> 14:23.333
DOES IT STOP ONE BEHEADING?
NO.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.333
IT JUST MEANS
SOME OTHER SCHMUCK CELEBRITY

14:25.333 --> 14:26.917
WILL GET MY GIFT BAG.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.834
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE ARE GIFT BAGS.

14:29.834 --> 14:33.959
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME THAT?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.166
- HE TOLD YOU WHAT?

14:37.166 --> 14:38.667
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.542
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD

14:40.542 --> 14:42.834
THAT WE TALKED
ALL ABOUT ME AND MERC

14:42.834 --> 14:44.208
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING--

14:44.208 --> 14:45.792
- WELL, I NEVER SAID ANYTHING

14:45.792 --> 14:47.917
BECAUSE I MADE HIM
EXPLICITLY PROMISE

14:47.917 --> 14:50.583
THAT NEITHER OF US
WOULD EVER, EVER TELL ANYONE.

14:50.583 --> 14:51.917
AND NOW HE'S TELLING YOU?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.083
- WELL, JUST ME.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.959
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
- NO.

14:54.959 --> 14:56.875
- I MEAN, IF HE'S TELLING YOU,
WHO ELSE IS HE TELLING?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.542
- I DON'T KNOW.
- UGH!

14:58.542 --> 15:00.208
I AM SO PISSED.

15:00.208 --> 15:04.041
I'M SAVING HIS ASS,
GIVING HIM A FUCKING TV SHOW,

15:04.041 --> 15:05.583
AND THIS IS HOW HE THANKS ME?

15:05.583 --> 15:09.000
- UM, IF IT HELPS, HE SAID
IT WAS AN AMAZING NIGHT.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.291
- THE ONLY THING AMAZING
IS THAT I DID IT.

15:12.291 --> 15:15.041
TALK ABOUT SHIT YOU REGRET.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.041
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF GETTING MY DIVORCE FROM ED.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.208
HE WAS STILL GETTING RID
OF THE FIRST ONE,

15:20.208 --> 15:21.667
WHAT'S-HER-NAME WITH NO CHIN?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.417
- MARLENE.
- MARLENE.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.917
YES. VERY GOOD.

15:24.917 --> 15:28.083
WE WERE BOTH DRUNK.
HE MADE A MOVE.

15:28.083 --> 15:31.083
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL?
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?"

15:31.083 --> 15:33.750
- THAT BAD?
- OH, MY GOD.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.083
IT'S LIKE HAVING SEX
WITH A POTATO.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.000
- YEAH.
- A SWEATING POTATO.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.583
OH, AND THIS WAS BACK
WHEN HE STILL HAD HIS TOUPEE.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.375
AT ONE POINT, IT CAME OFF.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.959
YEAH, I LOOKED DOWN,

15:44.959 --> 15:49.667
IT WAS LIKE THIS WET, LITTLE
FERRET ON MY STOMACH.

15:49.667 --> 15:50.750
- [laughing]
OH, GOD.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.667
- YEAH, AND THEN AT THE END--

15:52.667 --> 15:54.000
'CAUSE IT NEEDED TO GET WORSE--

15:54.000 --> 15:57.125
HE CAME ON A PICTURE OF MY KIDS.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.166
- WHAT?
- OH, YEAH.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.792
IT WAS ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

16:00.792 --> 16:04.291
NOW, WHEN YOU SAY TO A PERSON,
"NOT INSIDE ME,"

16:04.291 --> 16:05.417
THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM LICENSE

16:05.417 --> 16:07.000
TO JUST SHOOT IT
THE FUCK ANYWHERE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.792
- NO, IT DOES NOT.
- I'M SORRY.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.834
A LITTLE AIM--
IS THAT ASKING TOO MUCH?

16:10.834 --> 16:14.291
- TOTALLY FAIR.
- STUPID BAZOOKA DICK.

16:14.291 --> 16:18.291
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS THE LAST GUY
I WAS EVER WITH.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.709
AND I'M NOT SAYING
HE WAS THE REASON,

16:20.709 --> 16:23.542
BUT, UGH, TALK ABOUT
GOING OUT WITH A WHIMPER,

16:23.542 --> 16:25.542
LITERALLY A WHIMPER...

16:25.542 --> 16:27.667
A WHIMPER AND THEN A FART.

16:27.667 --> 16:31.417
- YEAH, THE FARTING THING
TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.625
- SO...

16:33.625 --> 16:35.208
WHAT ELSE DID HE TELL YOU?

16:35.208 --> 16:37.792
- UM, THAT'S IT.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.375
- MM.
- REALLY.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.709
OH.
- WHAT?

16:40.709 --> 16:43.333
- HE DID MENTION YOUR TATTOO.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.125
ALTHOUGH...
- WHAT?

16:45.125 --> 16:48.500
- HE THOUGHT IT WAS A SWASTIKA.
[laughs]

16:48.500 --> 16:49.834
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE KIDDING.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.875
- [laughing]
NOPE. A SWASTIKA.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.625
OH, COME ON, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
THAT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

16:56.625 --> 16:57.875
- NOT TO ME.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.166
HE'S GOING AROUND
TELLING PEOPLE

16:59.166 --> 17:01.166
I HAVE SOME SORT
OF ANTI-SEMITIC TWAT?

17:01.166 --> 17:03.792
OH, I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL HIM.

17:03.792 --> 17:06.166
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.000
BUT I'M SO GONNA GET HIS ASS.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.583
- OKAY,
NOW I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.917
- HE  SHOULD BE SCARED.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.250
- WH--

17:13.250 --> 17:15.875
IS IT REALLY THAT BIG A DEAL?

17:15.875 --> 17:17.000
- YES.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.083
DO YOU THINK I WANT PEOPLE
OUT THERE

17:19.083 --> 17:22.917
THINKING I SPENT EVEN ONE NIGHT
FUCKING MERC LAPIDUS?

17:22.917 --> 17:28.041
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT SAY
ABOUT ME AS A HUMAN BEING?

17:28.041 --> 17:31.417
- UH, FIVE YEARS.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.166
- OH, RIGHT.
- MM.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.667
- BUT THAT'S--
[chuckles]

17:35.667 --> 17:37.166
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.083
THAT'S--

17:39.083 --> 17:41.875
YOU--

17:41.875 --> 17:45.083
YEAH, I GOT NOTHING.
- YEAH.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.875
- IS IT ME,
OR ARE THERE MORE PILLOWS

17:55.875 --> 17:57.041
THAN THERE WERE THIS MORNING?

17:57.041 --> 17:58.625
[cell phone chimes]

17:58.625 --> 18:01.625
- WHO'S THAT AT 11:30?
- TIM.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.875
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT WE'RE ALL WEARING

18:03.875 --> 18:06.125
TO THE NETWORK MEETING TOMORROW.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.917
- DOESN'T HE REALIZE
HE'S OUR NEMESIS?

18:07.917 --> 18:09.792
HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ASKING
FOR FASHION TIPS.

18:09.792 --> 18:12.125
- I KNOW.
IT'S INSANE.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.667
- OF ALL THE BLOODY NERVE.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.417
WHAT ARE YOU TYPING?

18:17.417 --> 18:20.792
- "SMART CASUAL."

18:20.792 --> 18:22.500
THERE, DONE.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.291
PHONE OFF.

18:24.291 --> 18:28.208
AND LOOK, THE BED IS FINALLY
DENUDED OF PILLOWS.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.792
- [sighs]

18:36.792 --> 18:39.917
- SPEAKING OF "DENUDED"...

18:39.917 --> 18:41.917
- I NOTICED THAT WORD IN THERE.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.583
- I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT.
- [chuckling]

18:43.583 --> 18:47.083
- COME HERE, PLEASE.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.959
- SO POLITE.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.750
- WHAT?

19:00.750 --> 19:02.875
- NOTHING.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.333
- WHAT?
- [sighs]

19:09.041 --> 19:11.291
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT TIM.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.166
- HUH.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.959
WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE
OF AN ERECTION IS,

19:14.959 --> 19:18.333
I JUST GOT A BIG ONE.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.208
- I'M SORRY.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.417
[sighs]

19:22.417 --> 19:24.291
JUST THE THOUGHT OF WORKING
WITH HIM,

19:24.291 --> 19:29.291
BEING STUCK IN A ROOM
WITH HIM ALL DAY...

19:30.333 --> 19:32.000
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.667
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.500
- WELL, WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.375
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.417
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THE SHOW
WITHOUT ME.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.458
- WHAT?

19:43.458 --> 19:45.333
- YOU CAN DO IT,

19:45.333 --> 19:47.834
AND TIM CAN TYPE IT.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.500
- THAT'S CRAZY.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.750
- IT'S NOT.
I'LL BE FINE.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.709
I'LL GET A JOB ON ANOTHER SHOW,

19:54.709 --> 19:56.333
OR I'LL DO CHARITY WORK--

19:56.333 --> 19:59.208
MAYBE SOMETHING WITH REFUGEES
FROM KHARAKISTAN.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.375
- NO. NO.
I'M NOT DOING IT WITHOUT YOU.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.542
LOOK, I WISH TO HELL
I COULD JUST MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR,

20:04.542 --> 20:06.250
BUT I CAN'T.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.875
THIS SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY SOLUTION.

20:09.875 --> 20:14.625
- DON'T YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF COMPROMISING?

20:14.625 --> 20:18.291
- THAT'S HOW THE WORLD WORKS.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.834
JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.959
PLEASE.

20:24.959 --> 20:27.625
FOR ME.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.208
- THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.625
- THAT'S WHY I SAID IT.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.834
- [sighs]

20:33.834 --> 20:36.709
OKAY...

20:36.709 --> 20:39.959
FOR YOU.

20:39.959 --> 20:42.875
- I LOVE YOU.
- [chuckles]

20:48.959 --> 20:52.875
MM, LOOK WHO'S BACK.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.750
HE WAS VERY PATIENT.
- THANK YOU.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.709
HE DOESN'T GET TO HEAR THAT
NEARLY ENOUGH.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.917
- [chuckles]

21:03.875 --> 21:05.709
[sports broadcast playing on TV,
knock at door]

21:05.709 --> 21:08.041
- YEAH?

21:08.041 --> 21:09.917
- MAYBE THIS WILL JOG
YOUR MEMORY.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.291
- OF WHAT, THE '80s?

21:11.291 --> 21:13.625
HOW THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY THAT?

21:13.625 --> 21:15.000
- ON YOUR VCR?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.208
- NOBODY HAS A VCR.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.667
- [groans]
HEY.

21:19.667 --> 21:23.917
CAN YOU GET US A VCR?
- A WHAT?

21:27.208 --> 21:29.583
[people moaning on TV]

21:29.583 --> 21:31.250
- WAIT. STOP. STOP.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.667
- WHAT?

21:34.667 --> 21:36.125
- THAT IS NOT ME.

21:36.125 --> 21:39.208
- I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOU.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.333
AW, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

21:41.333 --> 21:44.250
THAT'S DEAN MARTIN'S DRIVER.
- OH, YEAH?

21:44.250 --> 21:46.500
- DEAN SHOT A GUEST SPOT
ON KELLY.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.458
- LOOKS LIKE HIS DRIVER SHOT
A GUEST SPOT ON KELLY TOO.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.500
- HANG ON.
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE NEXT.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.291
- NEXT?

21:54.291 --> 21:55.959
WHAT IS THIS--
THE VAGINA DELI?

21:55.959 --> 21:57.250
- [sighs]

21:57.250 --> 21:59.625
[people moaning]

21:59.625 --> 22:03.333
SO?
RING A BELL?

22:03.333 --> 22:06.041
- NOPE.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.709
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S--
OH.

22:07.709 --> 22:09.667
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

22:09.667 --> 22:13.125
- THANK YOU.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.834
- OH, MY GOD.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.333
I'M SO FUCKING YOUNG.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.917
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

22:21.917 --> 22:26.875
- YOU ACTUALLY LOOK
YOUNGER NOW.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.917
JESUS CHRIST.

22:28.917 --> 22:32.000
I'M LIKE A BABY.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.125
LOOK AT MY ASS!

22:34.125 --> 22:37.875
- IT WAS A GREAT ASS.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.417
- WELL,
THIS WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.

22:40.417 --> 22:43.834
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ME?

22:43.834 --> 22:48.500
- YEAH, IT'S A MYSTERY.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.834
- LOOK, YOU SEE THAT MOVE
WHERE I FLIPPED YOU OVER?

22:50.834 --> 22:54.750
I'D NEED TWO GUYS
TO HELP ME NOW.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.542
[sighs]

22:57.542 --> 23:00.458
[groans]

23:00.458 --> 23:05.208
THIS IS THE MOST DEPRESSING
SEX TAPE EVER.

23:05.208 --> 23:09.208
OH, MAN,
EVEN MY BALLS LOOK NEW!

23:09.208 --> 23:10.667
- SO WHY DON'T YOU CATCH US UP?

23:10.667 --> 23:12.959
HOW DID THE THREE
OF YOU GUYS MEET?

23:12.959 --> 23:15.083
- WELL, SEAN-Y AND I MET
AT UNIVERSITY.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.208
- OH, SO YOU DIDN'T
ALL START OUT TOGETHER?

23:17.208 --> 23:19.542
- OH, NO.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.500
HE AND I WERE PARTNERS
FOR YEARS.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.458
LA BEV CAME ALONG
MUCH, MUCH LATER.

23:24.458 --> 23:27.333
WE WERE ALL HIRED TO WORK
TOGETHER ON A SKETCH SHOW,

23:27.333 --> 23:30.208
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THERE SHE WAS

23:30.208 --> 23:34.250
WITH HER BITING WIT AND...

23:34.250 --> 23:36.917
PFFT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
[chuckles]

23:36.917 --> 23:38.667
- OH, SAY IT--

23:38.667 --> 23:40.041
VAGINA.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.000
[laughter]
- IT'S TRUE.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.625
HOW DO YOU COMPETE WITH THAT?

23:43.625 --> 23:44.917
[sighs]

23:44.917 --> 23:46.458
AND I JUST THOUGHT
THEY WERE CHEATING

23:46.458 --> 23:48.709
ON SEAN'S WIFE, EMMELINE.

23:48.709 --> 23:52.250
TURNS OUT I WAS OUT
WITH THE RUBBISH TOO.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.250
OH, AND I THOUGHT
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.709
[chuckles]

23:55.709 --> 23:57.709
- UH, RIGHT, WELL,
ANCIENT HISTORY.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.625
CLEARLY, EVERYTHING'S WORKED OUT
FOR THE BEST.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.041
- MM, TELL THAT TO EMMELINE.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.542
- I'LL HAVE MY VAGINA DROP HER
A NOTE.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.000
[laughs]

24:04.000 --> 24:05.667
- YEAH, THE POINT IS,
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER NOW,

24:05.667 --> 24:08.250
AND IT IS VERY EXCITING.
- MM-HMM.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.709
- WELL, LET'S TALK A LITTLE
ABOUT THAT.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.291
HOW DO YOU SEE THE THREE
OF YOU WORKING TOGETHER?

24:12.291 --> 24:13.917
- OH, WELL, UM...

24:13.917 --> 24:16.250
WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY WORKED OUT
THE NUTS AND BOLTS,

24:16.250 --> 24:20.417
BUT I THINK
WE BRING DIFFERENT SKILLS.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.458
- FOR INSTANCE, SEAN AND I
ACTUALLY WROTE THE SCRIPT,

24:23.458 --> 24:26.291
CREATED THE CHARACTERS,
ALL THE DIALOGUE.

24:26.291 --> 24:29.208
TIM IS APPARENTLY A WHIZ
AT THE TYPING.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.792
SO I GUESS HE BRINGS THAT.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.125
[chuckles]

24:32.125 --> 24:33.375
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
MORE THAN THAT,

24:33.375 --> 24:35.208
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY.
- THANK YOU.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.667
I LIKE TO THINK
I ALSO BRING PERSPECTIVE.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.625
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG--
THE SCRIPT IS BRILLIANT.

24:39.625 --> 24:40.959
OBVIOUSLY.

24:40.959 --> 24:43.709
BUT I THINK THESE TWO ARE
SO CLOSE TO IT,

24:43.709 --> 24:46.959
THEY CAN'T SEE THERE ARE WAYS
TO MAKE IT MUCH, MUCH BETTER.

24:46.959 --> 24:49.250
- SUCH AS?
- YES, PLEASE TELL US.

24:49.250 --> 24:53.083
- WELL, FOR STARTERS, I THINK
WE CAN REALLY UP THE COMEDY.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.333
- OH, MY GOSH.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.125
IF YOU COULD GET IT UP,

24:56.125 --> 24:57.792
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.500
[laughter]

24:59.500 --> 25:01.125
- MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING
WE SHOULD DISCUSS

25:01.125 --> 25:02.250
JUST THE THREE OF US.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.333
- ABSOLUTELY.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.709
AH, IT'S JUST THAT I REMEMBER

25:04.709 --> 25:06.542
WHEN SEAN-Y AND I
WERE COMING UP WITH IT.

25:06.542 --> 25:10.709
SOMEHOW THE WHOLE THING
JUST FELT FUNNIER.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.417
ALSO, I THINK THE CHARACTERS
CAN HAVE A LOT MORE BITE.

25:13.417 --> 25:16.333
- REALLY?
NEED MORE BITE, DO YOU?

25:16.333 --> 25:18.709
- OKAY.
- I MEAN, THEY'RE FINE.

25:18.709 --> 25:21.959
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
A LITTLE NOTHING-Y ABOUT THEM.

25:21.959 --> 25:24.333
- NOTHING-Y?
[chuckles]

25:24.333 --> 25:26.041
NOTHING-Y.

25:26.041 --> 25:27.250
- OOH,
OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED A NERVE.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.542
- NO.
YOU HAVE  A NERVE.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.500
- OKAY, I'M GONNA JUMP IN HERE,
IF I MAY.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.959
- PLEASE, GOD, DO.
- MM, MM-HMM.

25:32.959 --> 25:34.083
- EVERYONE HERE KNOWS

25:34.083 --> 25:36.125
THAT TO GET A SHOW RIGHT

25:36.125 --> 25:37.583
IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

25:37.583 --> 25:39.083
- EXACTLY.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.500
- TO GET A REAL BONA FIDE HIT--

25:41.500 --> 25:44.917
SOMETHING GREAT--
YOU NEED EVERYTHING SPOT-ON.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.667
IF YOU MAKE ONE MISTAKE,

25:46.667 --> 25:49.041
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE LIGHTNING
IN A BOTTLE.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.375
YOU JUST HAVE A BOTTLE.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.667
AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW

25:53.667 --> 25:56.542
THAT THIS IS THE MISTAKE.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.208
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.000
IT'S EITHER HIM OR US.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.041
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S A DEAL
MY LAWYERS

26:06.041 --> 26:07.667
WON'T BE TOO COMFORTABLE WITH.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.500
- WELL, HOPEFULLY
THEY'RE FUNNY LAWYERS,

26:09.500 --> 26:11.208
SINCE YOU'LL BE DOING THE SHOW
WITH THEM.

26:11.208 --> 26:14.208
ENOUGH BITE FOR YOU?

26:14.208 --> 26:17.792
LOOK, IF YOU BOW OUT NOW
AND THIS THING TAKES OFF,

26:17.792 --> 26:19.667
YOU'LL MAKE A TON OF MONEY.

26:19.667 --> 26:22.875
WE'LL LET EILEEN HERE
NEGOTIATE WITH HERSELF

26:22.875 --> 26:24.875
TO SEE WHAT SHE THINKS IS FAIR.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.709
YOU'LL STILL BE ONE
OF THE CREATORS OF A HIT SHOW,

26:27.709 --> 26:31.083
AND YOU CAN PARLAY THAT
INTO A WHOLE CAREER.

26:31.083 --> 26:32.792
OR YOU CAN DIG IN YOUR HEELS,

26:32.792 --> 26:35.583
INSIST ON BEING PART OF
SOMETHING THAT ISN'T HAPPENING,

26:35.583 --> 26:40.083
AND GET A BIG SLICE
OF NOTHING-Y PIE.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.750
YOUR CALL.

26:46.166 --> 26:49.041
- OH, NO.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.208
[traditional
Middle Eastern music]

26:55.208 --> 26:59.000
[indistinct chatter]

26:59.000 --> 27:06.917
â™ª â™ª

27:12.166 --> 27:14.291
- MM, THANKS.

27:20.792 --> 27:22.291
HOLY SHIT.

27:22.291 --> 27:25.166
- WHAT? NO WAY.
[laughs]

27:25.166 --> 27:27.250
OH, MY GOD.
HEY, BUDDY.

27:27.250 --> 27:28.583
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

27:28.583 --> 27:30.834
- YEAH.
- WERE YOU AT THE URANIUM MINE?

27:30.834 --> 27:33.208
- NO, NO, I DID THE THING
WITH THE DRONES.

27:33.208 --> 27:34.792
YEAH, WE EACH GOT
TO BLOW UP A JEEP.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.625
- AW, SHIT,
I SHOULD'VE DONE THAT ONE.

27:36.625 --> 27:40.125
- HOW INSANE IS THIS?
- OH, MY GOD.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.792
THAT THING WITH THE SWANS?

27:41.792 --> 27:43.583
- YEAH,
THAT WAS TOO MANY SWANS.

27:43.583 --> 27:47.625
- HEY, UH, ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
YOUR LLAMA?

27:47.625 --> 27:50.583
- [sighs]
IT'S A LOT TO SCHLEP BACK.

27:50.583 --> 27:51.709
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH IT?

27:51.709 --> 27:53.667
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT WAS A GIFT.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.083
I DON'T WANT TO PISS HIM OFF.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.542
- NO. NO.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.500
- HOW COME YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR THING?

27:58.500 --> 28:00.208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THEY SAID IT WAS OPTIONAL.

28:00.208 --> 28:03.500
- YEAH, BUT WHO KNOWS
WHAT "OPTIONAL" MEANS HERE?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.333
BESIDES, I-I KIND OF LIKE IT.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.667
I FEEL LIKE ALADDIN.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.166
- OR MRS. ROPER.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.500

[both chuckle]

28:12.500 --> 28:15.083
WANT TO GET SOME CAVIAR?
- UGH, REALLY? MORE?

28:15.083 --> 28:16.875
- YEAH.

28:16.875 --> 28:21.750
HEY, BY THE WAY, CAN I GET
A LIFT BACK TO THE PALACE?

28:21.750 --> 28:24.000
THEY SHOT MY DRIVER.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.458
- SERIOUSLY?
- [mouths word]

28:26.458 --> 28:29.417
- THIS PLACE IS NUTS.

28:29.417 --> 28:33.583
BUT, HEY,
