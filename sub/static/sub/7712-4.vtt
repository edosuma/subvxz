WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:06.107
COAT!

00:06.140 --> 00:08.809
MICHAEL JUST RENTED
THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.712
HE HAS HIS NETFLIX
SENT HERE TO THE OFFICE

00:11.745 --> 00:14.782
AND HE WATCHES THEM IN PIECES
WHEN THINGS ARE SLOW.

00:14.815 --> 00:18.652
(Michael)
STEAK!

00:18.686 --> 00:20.788
WHERE'S MY STEAK?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.323
(Pam)
HE'S A BIG MERYL STREEP FAN,

00:22.356 --> 00:23.557
SO I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

00:23.591 --> 00:25.493
THAT HE'S IDENTIFIED
WITH HER CHARACTER.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.760
GET ME ARMANI.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.697
A SUIT?
ON THE PHONE.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.698
LIKE THE MAIN COMPANY NUMBER

00:30.731 --> 00:32.133
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
INFORMATION--

00:32.166 --> 00:34.235
WHERE'S ARMANI?
HE'S ON THE PHONE.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.236
TOO SLOW.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.138
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARIS.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.440
I'M SO MUCH BETTER
THAN YOU ARE.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.742
[stifling laughter]

00:52.520 --> 00:54.588
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.824
YOU FINISHED THE MOVIE.

00:56.857 --> 00:57.758
YEAH, IT WAS AWESOME.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.693
BIG SURPRISE ENDING.
WON'T RUIN IT FOR YOU.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.829
NO, GO AHEAD.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.731
MERYL STREEP IS THE BAD GUY.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.233
YOU NEVER SEE IT COMING.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.236
ANYWAY, IF I WAS MEAN
IN ANY WAY TO YOU,

01:08.269 --> 01:09.803
I'M SORRY.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.839
I JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST

01:11.872 --> 01:14.342
FOR YOU, MINUSHKA.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.810
[silently]
MINUSHKA?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.214
MACUSHLA.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.450
HE'S WATCHING
MILLION DOLLAR BABY.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.721
HE'S GONNA TRY TO KILL ME.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.724
[cheerful music]

01:30.758 --> 01:36.764
*

01:59.887 --> 02:01.389
SO THIS ONE GOES WITH
MY EYES

02:01.422 --> 02:03.357
AND THIS ONE GOES WITH
YOUR EYES.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.393
PEOPLE HAVE SAID
I HAVE VERY PRETTY EYES.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.694
YOU DO.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.761
I HAVEN'T HEARD THE SAME
ABOUT YOU.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.597
SO LET'S JUST GO
WITH MINE.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.466
WELL THEY BOTH GO WITH
THE CARPET THAT I'VE ORDERED.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.934
AND IF WE GO WITH
THE BROWN LEATHER ON THE SOFAS

02:13.967 --> 02:14.735
THEN THEY GO WITH THAT TOO.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.238
WE ALREADY HAVE A SOFA,
SO WHY DO--

02:17.271 --> 02:18.772
A FUTON'S NOT A SOFA.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.774
IT FOLDS UP.
YOU'VE ONLY SEEN IT FLAT.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.909
I KNOW WHAT A FUTON IS,
MICHAEL.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.311
I--OKAY.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.878
HOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA COST?

02:24.912 --> 02:25.679
IT COSTS WHAT IT COSTS.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.216
NO--THAT DOESN'T EVEN MEAN
ANYTHING.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.250
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.651
YES!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.486
MONEY HAS BEEN
A LITTLE BIT TIGHT LATELY.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.356
BUT AT THE END OF MY LIFE,

02:35.389 --> 02:37.291
WHEN I'M SITTING ON MY YACHT,

02:37.325 --> 02:39.427
AM I GONNA BE THINKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.230
NO, I'M GONNA BE THINKING

02:42.263 --> 02:44.398
ABOUT HOW MANY FRIENDS I HAVE

02:44.432 --> 02:48.669
AND MY CHILDREN
AND MY COMEDY ALBUMS.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.338
I MEAN, I HAVE A YACHT,

02:50.371 --> 02:53.841
SO OBVIOUSLY DID PRETTY WELL,
MONEY-WISE.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.244
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU SAY IT'S GONNA COST WHAT--

02:56.277 --> 02:57.778
[phone ringing]

02:57.811 --> 02:58.812
YEAH?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.680
[Pam on speaker]
MICHAEL, IT'S RYAN FOR YOU.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.982
CONNIVING LITTLE RUNT--
PUT HIM THROUGH.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.584
PUT HIM THROUGH.
YES?

03:03.617 --> 03:04.818
RYAN, MY MAN!

03:04.852 --> 03:05.819
[Ryan on speaker]
I SENT YOU AN EMAIL

03:05.853 --> 03:06.654
ABOUT THE NEW POWERPOINT.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.889
YES, THANK YOU FOR SENDING THAT
TO ME.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.791
I HAD I.T. INSTALL
THE UPDATED POWERPOINT

03:10.824 --> 03:12.560
ON YOUR COMPUTER
SO YOU CAN USE IT

03:12.593 --> 03:13.627
FOR THE PRESENTATION.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.862
I REALLY WANT PEOPLE THERE
USING POWERPOINT.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.230
OKAY, YEAH.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.798
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.667
I THINK THOSE I.T. GUYS
MESSED UP.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.601
HOLD ON, I'LL GET THEM
ON THE PHONE.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.803
WAIT, NO--HERE IT IS,
HERE IT IS--FOUND IT.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.705
SURE, I CAN HOLD.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.939
[phone ringing]

03:25.973 --> 03:27.741
DUNDER MIFFLIN,
DWIGHT SCHRUTE.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.210
PLEASE HOLD.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.791
SCHRUTE FARMS.
GUTTENTAG.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.692
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.728
YES, WE HAVE AVAILABILITY
ON THOSE NIGHTS.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.498
HOW MANY IN YOUR PARTY?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.800
OH, NO, I'M SORRY.
NO KING BEDS.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.803
NO QUEEN EITHER.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.737
WELL WE MAKE OUR OWN MATTRESSES

03:56.770 --> 04:00.007
THAT DON'T CONFORM
TO THE TRADITIONAL SIZES.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.709
CLOSEST WOULD BE TWIN.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.644
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.480
CALL BACK AGAIN.
AUF WIEDERSEHEN.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.049
HEY DWIGHT.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.751
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, JIM.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.486
YOU RUNNING A BED
AND BREAKFAST?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.587
IT IS NOT A B & B.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.323
AGRO-TOURISM IS A LOT MORE

04:15.356 --> 04:16.790
THAN A BED AND BREAKFAST.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.860
IT CONSISTS OF TOURISTS
COMING TO A FARM,

04:19.893 --> 04:21.429
SHOWING THEM AROUND,

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
GIVING THEM A BED,

04:23.731 --> 04:27.034
GIVING THEM BREAKFAST.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.902
DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.038
I AM NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.507
PERMITS ARE PENDING.
[phone ringing]

04:33.541 --> 04:34.842
DWIGHT SCHRUTE,
DUNDER MIFFLIN.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.776
(Pam)
HELLO, I'M LOOKING
FOR A ROOM.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.879
OKAY, THIS IS A MISUSE
OF COMPANY PHONES.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.081
IT SAYS HERE YOU CATER
TO THE ELDERLY.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.316
WHERE DID YOU READ THAT?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.752
TRIP ADVISOR.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.987
TRIP ADVISOR IS THE LIFEBLOOD

04:47.020 --> 04:49.557
OF THE AGRO-TOURISM INDUSTRY.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.824
A COUPLE OF BAD REVIEWS THERE,

04:50.858 --> 04:52.493
YOU MAY AS WELL
CLOSE UP SHOP.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.728
THAT'S WHAT TOOK DOWN
THE STALK INN,

04:54.762 --> 04:58.732
ONE OF THE CUTEST LITTLE
ASPARAGUS FARMS YOU'LL EVER SEE.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.501
HOW MANY IN YOUR PARTY?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.336
TWO.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.838
WE OFFER OUR TOURS
OF THE FIELDS AND OF THE BARN.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.474
PERHAPS YOU'D BE INTERESTED

05:06.507 --> 05:09.910
IN MOSE'S TABLE-MAKING
DEMONSTRATION.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.546
SO, UM, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
THAT I NEED THE CAR TONIGHT.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.815
OH, UM, ACTUALLY,

05:14.848 --> 05:15.816
I NEED THE CAR.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.818
WHY?
FOR IMPROV?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.887
WELL WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PRETEND

05:19.920 --> 05:22.390
THAT YOU HAVE A CAR?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.591
GOOD PRACTICE IN CASE YOU EVER

05:23.624 --> 05:26.360
DO A SCENE WHERE YOU NEED
TO PRETEND YOU HAVE A CAR.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.895
USED TO HAVE TWO CARS.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.096
TRADED 'EM IN.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.831
NOW WE'RE DOWN TO ONE.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.900
GOOD ECONOMIC SENSE.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.369
ALTHOUGH THE NEW CAR'S
A PORSCHE...

05:35.403 --> 05:36.637
FOR HER.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.873
ONE CARDIGAN.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.544
ONE SLEEPING CARDIGAN.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.812
ONE SLEEP APNEA MASK.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.117
WHAT ABOUT MY CHERUB FIGURINE?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.685
YOU TOOK THAT WITH YOU.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.054
NO, I LEFT IT ON MY NIGHT TAB--

05:54.087 --> 05:56.524
YOUR NIGHT TABLE
BY THE LAMP.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.459
YOU ARE INCORRECT.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.661
I WAS RECENTLY SCRUBBING
MY ROOM OF MEMORIES

06:00.694 --> 06:02.830
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT THERE.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.164
FINE.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.567
(Dwight)
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I BROKE UP
RECENTLY

06:06.600 --> 06:09.637
AND I MUST SAY
I AM RELIEVED.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.038
GIVES ME A CHANCE
TO SOW MY WILD OATS.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.973
IN THE SCHRUTE FAMILY,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.808
WE HAVE A TRADITION

06:14.842 --> 06:16.977
WHERE WHEN THE MALE
HAS SEX WITH ANOTHER WOMAN

06:17.010 --> 06:18.912
HE IS REWARDED WITH A BAG
OF WILD OATS

06:18.946 --> 06:21.849
LEFT ON HIS DOORSTEP
BY HIS PARENTS.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.151
YOU CAN USE THOSE OATS
TO MAKE OATMEAL, BREAD--

06:24.184 --> 06:25.586
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.721
I DON'T CARE.
THEY'RE YOUR OATS.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.157
THE BAR USES AN APPLAUSE METER.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.726
THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT

06:32.760 --> 06:34.094
THAT YOU ALL COME
AND APPLAUD

06:34.127 --> 06:35.629
ONLY FOR MY BAND,

06:35.663 --> 06:37.631
SCRANTONICITY 2.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.600
NOT SCRANTONICITY,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.635
WHICH I AM NO LONGER
A PART OF.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.472
MICHAEL, CAN I COUNT ON YOU?

06:44.505 --> 06:45.639
YOU CANNOT.
I HAVE A THING TONIGHT.

06:45.673 --> 06:46.907
(Kevin)
DAMN IT.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.742
[silently]

06:48.776 --> 06:49.877
UH, MICHAEL.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.612
WHAT?
THAT REMINDS ME.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.047
UM, IF THE INVITATION
STILL STANDS,

06:54.081 --> 06:57.017
PAM AND I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE DINNER TONIGHT.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.185
OH, NO.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.854
I HAVE A THING TONIGHT.
SHH--

07:00.888 --> 07:02.690
THAT STINKS.
DARN IT.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.891
SHOOT.

07:03.924 --> 07:04.892
HOW ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.460
NO, CAN'T.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.761
WE ONLY HAD TONIGHT FREE

07:07.795 --> 07:09.897
AND WE REALLY WANTED
TO SPEND IT WITH YOU.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.799
DAMN IT TO HELL!

07:11.832 --> 07:13.801
I--AH--OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.235
(Jim)
WHAT DO YOU GOT
GOING ON TONIGHT?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.438
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A SECRET.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.609
I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
OR IT'S A SECRET?

07:21.642 --> 07:22.976
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND,
JIM.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.514
(Pam)
IT'S A SECRET.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.054
(Michael)
I'M SORRY, MR. O'BRIEN.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.222
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT
YOUR DINNER.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.990
I JUST HAVE
A VERY EXCITING OFFER.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.627
MY RECORDS INDICATE
THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST

07:39.660 --> 07:41.094
IN LOSING SOME WEIGHT.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.563
WELL WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

07:42.596 --> 07:43.864
THAT I HAVE A PILL
THAT WILL MAKE YOU

07:43.897 --> 07:45.766
50 POUNDS LIGHTER
IN FIVE MINUTES?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.967
HOW WOULD THAT SOUND?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.836
AMAZING, RIGHT?

07:48.869 --> 07:52.072
WELL IT WON'T BE THAT FAST
BUT IT WILL--

07:52.105 --> 07:54.241
IT WILL BE THAT EASY.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.879
(Jim)
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE
IS REAL.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.682
I MEAN I'D HEARD ABOUT
HIS BEET FARM FOR YEARS,

08:01.715 --> 08:02.883
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT--

08:02.916 --> 08:03.851
THE BEETS MOTEL.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.853
THE BEETS MOTEL.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.087
THAT IS--WOW.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.121
THANK YOU.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.758
(Jim)
BORSCHT HOTEL.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.292
EH.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.094
THE EMBASSY BEETS.
RADISH INN.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.162
(Jim)
HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.196
(Pam)
I DON'T KNOW.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.574
(Pam)
OH, MY GOSH.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.615
(Michael)
I JUST LOVE SALES.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.650
I LOVE IT TO DEATH.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.985
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.621
AND I DON'T GET TO DO
ENOUGH OF IT AS A MANAGER,

08:40.654 --> 08:44.958
SO I TOOK THIS SECOND JOB
KIND OF AS A HOBBY.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.996
SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOLF
OR RELAXING.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.664
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.900
HEY, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE

08:52.933 --> 08:54.868
AND I WAS GONNA MAKE
ANOTHER CALL.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.904
WE'RE A LEGIT OPERATION

08:56.937 --> 08:58.639
WITH A LICENSE FROM THE CITY
I CAN SHOW YOU.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.874
WE PAY MINIMUM WAGE

09:00.908 --> 09:02.275
THEY'RE WITH ME, SO...

09:02.309 --> 09:04.044
THIS IS NICK FIGARO,

09:04.077 --> 09:06.814

09:06.847 --> 09:09.182
(Dwight)
WE HAVE THREE ROOMS,
EACH WITH A DIFFERENT THEME.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.851
WHAT ARE THE THEMES?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.987
AMERICA, IRRIGATION,

(Jim)
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED

10:50.150 --> 10:53.921
THIS IS PAM'S AND MY FIRST NIGHT
AWAY TOGETHER.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.856
I USED TO PLAY IT OVER
IN MY HEAD

10:55.889 --> 10:59.026
AND IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.194
MAYBE A, UH, NICE HOTEL

THAT WASN'T MADE OUT OF BEETS.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.370
DIDN'T THINK DWIGHT WOULD
BE INVOLVED AT ALL.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.941
AND, UH, I ALWAYS IMAGINED
LESS MANURE.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.908
YOU NEED TO SPREAD IT.

11:14.942 --> 11:15.943
I MEAN, SOME MANURE.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.277
JUST...LESS.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.411
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
IT'S GONNA WORK FOR BEETS.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.412
THIS IS BEET FOOD.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.881

11:50.878 --> 11:52.345
I KNOW YOUR VOICE.
ALL RIGHT.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.515
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME
HERE AT HOME?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.018
WHEN I'M AT HOME AT NIGHT
IN MY OWN HOUSE

11:58.051 --> 12:00.053
IN MY SWEATS,
DRINKING SOME RED WINE,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.121
WATCHING MY MYSTERY STORIES,

THE LAST THING
IN THE WHOLE GODFORSAKEN WORLD

12:03.991 --> 12:06.359
I WANT TO HEAR
IS THE VOICE OF MICHAEL SCOTT.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.796
WELL YOUR SON SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S REALLY MOTIVATED.

12:08.829 --> 12:09.930
I THINK IT'S CRAZY

12:09.963 --> 12:12.365
THAT THE COACH
WON'T PLAY HIM, FRANKLY.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.366
MY OFFICE.

I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE HAVE TO KEEP HAVING

12:21.975 --> 12:23.076
THIS CONVERSATION.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.211
LOOK, I KNOW SALES

12:24.244 --> 12:25.779
AND I HAD THAT SALE.

12:25.813 --> 12:26.746
I JUST NEEDED
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.016
A FEW MORE MINUTES
IS A WASTE OF OUR TIME!

12:29.049 --> 12:29.783
IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.084
THIS IS A TRADING GAME.
NO.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.953
YOU GIVE A QUICK PITCH.
LOOK--

12:32.986 --> 12:33.954

AND MOVE ON.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.122
THAT'S HOW VIKRAM DOES IT.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.990
VIKRAM DOESN'T HAVE
MY PEOPLE SKILLS.

12:37.024 --> 12:41.228

19:03.643 --> 19:08.281
AND THE BEST WAY TO START
IS TO HIT START.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.918
AND UP COMES THE TOOL BAR.

19:11.951 --> 19:12.952
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.189
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE

19:16.223 --> 19:17.924
IS GO TO RUN.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.393
AND THEN...

19:20.427 --> 19:22.862
YOU LOOK UP TO...

19:22.895 --> 19:25.365
POWERPOINT.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.300
AND WE ARE IN.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.436
WE ARE GOING TO REGISTER.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.304
YOU HIT REGISTER.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.639
UPDATES ARE READY.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.906
I SHOULD UPDATE.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.576
UM...

19:36.609 --> 19:38.311
ESTIMATED TIME 12 MINUTES.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.280
SO THIS SHOULD TAKE
ABOUT 5 OR 10 MINUTES.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.714
(Ryan)
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE OPENED POWERPOINT?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.616
WHY?

19:43.650 --> 19:44.951
YOU DIDN'T PREPARE
A PRESENTATION AT ALL, DID YOU?

19:44.984 --> 19:47.487
KNOW WHAT?
I HAD A REALLY ROUGH NIGHT.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.955
AND MY BOSS CAN BACK ME UP
ON THAT.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.390
I'M YOUR BOSS.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.524
MY OTHER BOSS,
MR. FIGARO.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.260
YOU HAVE ANOTHER JOB?

19:53.293 --> 19:56.729
WHAT I DO BETWEEN 5:30 PM
AND 1:00 AM

19:56.763 --> 19:58.565
IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT MINE

19:58.598 --> 19:59.599
AND MY OTHER BUSINESSES.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.569
ARE YOU A COCKTAIL WAITRESS?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.571
YOU CANNOT HAVE
A SECOND JOB

20:04.604 --> 20:06.706
IF IT AFFECTS YOUR WORK HERE.
IT WON'T.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.475
IT DID ALREADY.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.610
OKAY, HONESTLY,

20:10.643 --> 20:11.811
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT I WAS

20:11.844 --> 20:13.680
GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT ANYWAY,
SO...

20:13.713 --> 20:15.848
[Kelly giggling]

20:15.882 --> 20:17.684
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.419
(Ryan)
WHY IS DARRYL HERE?
HE WORKS IN THE WAREHOUSE.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.420
I INVITED HIM.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.421
IT'S NOT A PARTY.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.589
DARRYL, BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.656
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
YOU NEED.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.625
THIS INFORMATION HERE?

20:25.658 --> 20:28.261
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T NEED THIS.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.496
OKAY.
MMM.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.966
HEY, COME ON.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.568
(Kelly)
UM, SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.636
I GOT PLANS LATER.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.438
OKAY, BYE HONEY.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.678
HOW LONG TILL YOU ACTUALLY

20:45.712 --> 20:46.479
GET THIS PRESENTATION READY?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.681
WHY DON'T YOU DO
THE PRESENTATION?

20:48.715 --> 20:49.416
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT--

20:49.449 --> 20:50.750
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.352
WHAT I REALLY WANT--
HONESTLY, MICHAEL,

20:52.385 --> 20:53.953
IS FOR YOU TO KNOW IT
SO THAT YOU CAN COMMUNICATE

20:53.986 --> 20:56.589
TO THE PEOPLE HERE,
TO YOUR CLIENTS, TO WHOMEVER.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.558
OH, OKAY.
WHAT?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.360
IT'S WHOEVER,
NOT WHOMEVER.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.328
NO, IT'S WHOMEVER.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.929
NO, WHOMEVER
IS NEVER ACTUALLY RIGHT.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.364
WELL SOMETIMES IT'S RIGHT.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.565
(Creed)
MICHAEL IS RIGHT.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.700
IT'S A MADE-UP WORD
USED TO TRICK STUDENTS.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.736
NO, ACTUALLY WHOMEVER

21:09.769 --> 21:11.804
IS THE FORMAL VERSION
OF THE WORD.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.473
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A REAL WORD,

21:13.506 --> 21:14.574
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHEN
TO USE IT CORRECTLY.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.675
NOT A NATIVE SPEAKER.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.676
(Kevin)
I KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT

21:16.709 --> 21:18.445
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAY

21:18.478 --> 21:19.679
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL JERKS

21:19.712 --> 21:21.514
WHO DIDN'T COME SEE
MY BAND LAST NIGHT.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.582
DO YOU REALLY KNOW
WHICH ONE IS CORRECT?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.384
I DON'T KNOW.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.652
IT'S WHOM WHEN IT
IS THE OBJECT OF THE SENTENCE.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.886
AND W WHEN IT IS THE SUBJECT.

21:26.919 --> 21:27.887
THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.955
WELL IT SOUNDS RIGHT
BUT IS IT?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.390
HOW DID RYAN USE IT,
AS AN OBJECT?

21:30.423 --> 21:31.524
AS AN OBJECT.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.725
RYAN USED ME
AS AN OBJECT.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.893
(Stanley)
IS HE RIGHT ABOUT THAT?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.027
(Pam)
HOW DID HE USE IT AGAIN?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.529
IT WAS RYAN WANTED MICHAEL,

21:36.563 --> 21:37.564
THE SUBJECT,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.065
TO EXPLAIN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM,

21:39.098 --> 21:40.367
THE OBJECT.
THANK YOU.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.167
TO WHOMEVER,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.102
MEANING US,
THE INDIRECT OBJECT,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.572
WHICH IS THE CORRECT USAGE
OF THE WORD.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.375
NO ONE ASKED YOU ANYTHING EVER,

21:48.408 --> 21:49.742
SO WHOMEVER'S NAME IS TOBY,

21:49.776 --> 21:51.043
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A LETTER OPENER

21:51.077 --> 21:52.379
AND STICK IT
INTO YOUR SKULL.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.513
(Ryan)
HEY, THIS DOESN'T MATTER.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.114
AND I DON'T EVEN CARE.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.351
MICHAEL, YOU QUIT THE OTHER JOB
OR YOU'RE FIRED HERE.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.423
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.692
I'VE NEVER QUIT ANYTHING

22:05.725 --> 22:09.696
IN MY LIFE, SO...

22:09.729 --> 22:11.464
YOU ARE FILMING HISTORY.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.099
NICK, I HAD A DREAM
LAST NIGHT

22:13.132 --> 22:15.134
THAT I HAD TWO FULL-TIME JOBS.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.871
ONE HERE AT THE LIPAPHEDRAZONE
DIET PILL COMPANY.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.373
LIPAPHEDRINE.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.041
AND THE OTHER,
I WAS A REGIONAL MANAGER

22:22.074 --> 22:24.877
OF A SMALL PAPER SUPPLY COMPANY
CALLED DUNDER MIFFLIN.

22:24.911 --> 22:25.845
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.480
IN THIS DREAM,

22:27.514 --> 22:30.016
I DID BOTH OF THESE JOBS
BEAUTIFULLY.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.584
AND I LOVED IT.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.119
AND EVERYBODY LOVED ME.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.754
THE TRUTH IS

22:34.787 --> 22:36.856
I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:36.889 --> 22:37.990
ARE YOU QUITTING?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.027
I AM.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.429
COME BACK ANYTIME.

22:42.462 --> 22:46.466
DON'T FORGET TO DISINFECT
YOUR HEADSET.

22:46.499 --> 22:50.703
I WAS NEVER IN THIS
FOR THE MONEY.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.872
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT
THE MONEY

22:52.905 --> 22:54.841
WAS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
FOR ME.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.744
I TRIED TO LIVE
THE DREAM.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.778
I TRIED TO HAVE A JOB,

22:58.811 --> 22:59.846
A GIRLFRIEND,

22:59.879 --> 23:02.549
ANOTHER JOB,

23:02.582 --> 23:04.917
AND I FAILED.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.520
BUT THE GOOD THING
ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM

23:07.554 --> 23:10.857
IS THAT YOU CAN JUST
GO TO SLEEP.

23:10.890 --> 23:15.462
AND TRY IT ALL AGAIN
THE NEXT NIGHT.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.069
SO.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.973
WHAT'S UP?

23:27.006 --> 23:28.475
ME, ALL NOT,

23:28.508 --> 23:30.877
DREAMING ABOUT ANGELA'S
SMOKING HOT BODY.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.911
YOU'RE BEING GROSS.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.813
NOT FROM A MALE PERSPECTIVE.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.548
YOU NEED TO SET ME UP
WITH HER.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.116
I KNOW SHE TOLD YOU
THAT SHE'S LOOKING

23:37.149 --> 23:39.819
AND SHE'S TOTALLY NOT RESPONDING
TO MY MOVES.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.120
WHAT MOVES?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.790
I'VE MOONWALKED PAST ACCOUNTING,
LIKE, TEN TIMES.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.224
CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S NOT WORKING.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.859
YEAH.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.128
UM, I DON'T KNOW

23:49.161 --> 23:50.196
IF I REALLY SEE YOU TWO
TOGETHER.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.798
REALLY?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.466
WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK

23:53.500 --> 23:55.602
IN THE SMART PART
OF YOUR BRAIN.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.236
SHE'S VERY RELIGIOUS.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.105
OKAY, WELL I COME FROM
A LINE OF W.A.S.P.S

23:59.138 --> 24:01.808
SO LONG IT LEADS BACK
TO MOSES.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.610
OKAY, WELL SHE TAKES
HER CONVICTIONS

24:03.643 --> 24:04.911
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.579
SHE COULD BE
KIND OF SEVERE.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.914
YEAH, AND I PUNCHED
A HOLE IN A WALL.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.816
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU DID.
YEAH.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.183
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

24:11.217 --> 24:14.554
ANGELA AND ANDY MIGHT ACTUALLY
MAKE A GOOD COUPLE.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.524
BUT I COULDN'T TO THAT
TO DWIGHT...

24:17.557 --> 24:20.159
OR ANGELA...

24:20.192 --> 24:21.961
OR ANDY.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.500
HEY KEVIN,

24:27.534 --> 24:29.902
YOU'RE A GAMBLER, RIGHT?

24:29.936 --> 24:31.604
A ROUNDER.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.874
YOU PLAY THE PONIES,
SMALL HORSES.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.844
I DO GAMBLE, MICHAEL.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.979
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING
SOME GAMBLING MYSELF.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.014
YOU KNOW, JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.916
MAYBE DOUBLING IT
AND THEN DOUBLING IT

24:43.950 --> 24:45.918
SEVERAL MORE TIMES.

24:45.952 --> 24:46.819
I DON'T KNOW.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.755
KIND OF JUST FOR FUN.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.523
I WAS THINKING DO YOU HAVE

24:50.557 --> 24:53.660
ANY TIPS OR IDEAS
ABOUT SURE THINGS?

24:53.693 --> 24:55.227
LIKE A BOXER,

24:55.261 --> 24:57.730
UM...

24:57.764 --> 25:01.601
WHO IS GONNA THROW
THE BIG FIGHT.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.969
YOU KNOW, LIKE HE'S--

25:03.002 --> 25:05.805
HE'S TIED INTO SOME CROOKED
DEALINGS

25:05.838 --> 25:07.874
AND MAYBE HIS KID
IS SICK OR SOMETHING.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.008
LIKE, WHO DO I CALL
ABOUT THAT?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.244
[whispering]
THE MOB.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.214
[whispering]
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
IN THE MOB?

25:18.284 --> 25:22.054
OKAY, UM...

25:22.088 --> 25:25.191
OSCAR...

25:25.224 --> 25:27.293
[whispering]
I'M GONNA NEED TO TAKE
ANOTHER ADVANCE ON MY SALARY.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.897
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?

25:30.930 --> 25:31.998
I HAVE MY DAUGHTER TONIGHT.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.866
WE'RE RENTING
CHARLOTTE'S WEB.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.234
WELL YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.769
IT'S EITHER YOUR DAUGHTER
OR ME.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.171
MY DAUGHTER.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.940
OKAY.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.541
I SEE HOW IT IS.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.312
OOPS.

25:49.782 --> 25:50.783
THAT WAS COLD.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.126
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN TERRIBLE
WITH MONEY.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.695
I BET IT'S JAN SPENDING HIM
STRAIGHT TO THE POORHOUSE.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.964
YEAH, WOMEN BE SHOPPIN'.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.233
(Meredith)
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE HAS A SECOND JOB.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.968
HE'S NOT EVEN GOOD
AT HIS FIRST ONE.

26:09.001 --> 26:09.836
(Michael)
HEY GUYS.

26:09.869 --> 26:10.903
SHH.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.342
WHATCHA TALKING ABOUT?

26:16.375 --> 26:18.845
OKAY, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.179
TALKING ABOUT JIM AND PAM.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.048
IF THEY'RE HAVING SEX,
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE--I KNOW.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.049
MICHAEL.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.984
HEY, HEY, HEY.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.286
(Oscar)
MICHAEL,

26:27.319 --> 26:28.888
ARE YOU HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS?

26:28.921 --> 26:30.122
MONKEY PROBLEMS?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.758
NO, I'M NOT HAVING
MONKEY PROBLEMS.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.359
WHY WOULD I HAVE
MONKEY PROBLEMS?

26:33.392 --> 26:34.994
I KNOW YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY.

26:35.027 --> 26:35.862
OH, I HATE MONKEYS.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.029
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.030
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A SECOND JOB?

26:38.064 --> 26:40.833
I DON'T HAVE
A SECOND JOB.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.903
MAYBE I AM HAVING AN AFFAIR

26:43.936 --> 26:45.838
WITH SUZANNE SOMMERS.

26:45.872 --> 26:46.973
DOESN'T JAN HAVE MONEY?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.340
I DON'T TALK TO MY GIRLFRIEND
ABOUT MONEY.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.743
IT IS RUDE AND UNSEXUAL.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.279
TRUE, IT'S BEST TO HIDE
OUR MONEY PROBLEMS FROM WOMEN.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.147
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.349
BUT I DON'T HAVE MONEY PROBLEMS.
THAT--

26:57.383 --> 26:59.085
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:59.118 --> 27:03.222
WATCH THIS.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.758
IF I HAD MONEY PROBLEMS,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.026
WOULD I DO THIS?

27:15.201 --> 27:16.002
WELL--

27:16.035 --> 27:17.203
YOU JUST PUT IT
BACK IN YOUR POCKET.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.204
(Phyllis)
YEAH.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.338
YEAH, BUT I DESTROYED IT.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.674
IT'S NOT EVEN USABLE
ANYMORE.

27:24.777 --> 27:28.414
HEY, LET'S CALL THIS
WHAT IT IS.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.450
IT'S LIKE SHE ONLY WANTS
TO HOOK UP

27:31.483 --> 27:33.920
WHEN RYAN COMES AROUND.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.421
IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT
WHERE I GET EXCITED

27:35.454 --> 27:38.825
ANYTIME I SEE THAT LITTLE DUDE
WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.828
WELL I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

27:41.861 --> 27:45.331
HEY, I LIKE YOU.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.000
ALL RIGHT?

27:48.034 --> 27:50.870
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

27:50.903 --> 27:54.073
BUT YOU NEED TO ACCESS
YOUR UNCRAZY SIDE.

27:54.106 --> 27:58.044
OTHERWISE MAYBE THIS THING
HAS RUN ITS COURSE.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.748
DON'T YOU DARE WALK AWAY
FROM ME, DARRYL PHILBIN.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.182
YOU ARE THE MOST SELFISH PERSON

28:03.215 --> 28:04.416
I'VE EVER MET
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE--

28:04.450 --> 28:05.985
SLOW DOWN.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.987
THINK IT OVER.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.791
DARRYL PHILBIN IS
THE MOST COMPLICATED MAN

28:11.824 --> 28:13.392
THAT I'VE EVER MET.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.329
I MEAN, WHO SAYS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.932
WHAT KIND OF GAME IS THAT?

28:22.969 --> 28:24.771
HEY, CUZ.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.272
HEARD YOU'RE HAVING
MONEY PROBLEMS.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.007
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.075
LISTEN, I GOT THE ANSWER.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.409
YOU DECLARE BANKRUPTCY,

28:30.442 --> 28:32.311
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS GO AWAY.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.814
CREED BRATTON HAS NEVER DECLARED
BANKRUPTCY.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.282
WHEN CREED BRATTON
GETS IN TROUBLE,

28:36.315 --> 28:40.252
HE TRANSFERS HIS DEBT
TO WILLIAM CHARLES SCHNEIDER.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.854
HOW WOULD THAT HELP, CREED?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.156
IN MONOPOLY,
YOU GO BANKRUPT, YOU LOSE.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.025
YOU DON'T GO BY MONOPOLY,
MAN.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.927
THAT GAME IS NUTS.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.163
NOBODY JUST PICKS UP
"GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARDS.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.866
THOSE THINGS COST THOUSANDS.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.234
THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.004
BANKRUPTCY, MICHAEL,
IS NATURE'S DO-OVER.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.505
IT'S A FRESH START.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.007
IT'S A CLEAN SLATE

29:01.040 --> 29:02.541
LIKE THE WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.111
EXACTLY.
NOT AT ALL.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.412
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE

29:06.445 --> 29:08.480
IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.517
FRESH START: NO DEBTS,
NO BAGGAGE.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.853
I'VE ALREADY GOT MY NAME
PICKED OUT:

29:13.886 --> 29:16.022
"LORD RUPERT EVERTON."

29:16.055 --> 29:18.257
I'M A, UH, SHIPPING MERCHANT

29:18.290 --> 29:20.226
WHO RAISES FANCY DOGS.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.395
THAT'S THE LIFE.
[hits desk]

29:28.067 --> 29:30.769
I-DECLARE-BANKRUPTCY!

29:41.247 --> 29:43.182
[knocking on door]

29:43.215 --> 29:45.484
HEY, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW

29:45.517 --> 29:47.887
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THE WORD
"BANKRUPTCY"

29:47.920 --> 29:49.555
AND EXPECT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.457
I DIDN'T SAY IT;
I DECLARED IT.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.927
STILL THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT ANYTHING.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.929
THIS IS A LOT
OF CREDIT CARD DEBT.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.430
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.132
YOU KNOW, JAN HAS
MY CREDIT CARDS

30:00.166 --> 30:03.435
AND SHE'S USING 'EM AS IF
I'M MADE OF MONEY.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.038
SHE THINKS I'M A HUMAN
ATM MACHINE.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.975
OKAY, $125: AMAZON.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.578
OH, BEST OF THE MUPPET SHOW
ON DVD.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.612
CLASSIC.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.281
$1,200.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.349
WHAT'S A CORE-BLASTER EXTREME?

30:17.383 --> 30:21.087
THAT IS BY FAR THE BEST WAY
TO STRENGTHEN YOUR CORE.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.588
THIS MACHINE--

30:22.621 --> 30:24.423
YOU SIT ON A STABILIZER BALL.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.558
YOU PUT YOUR FEET
INTO THE POWER STIRRUPS,

30:26.592 --> 30:28.494
YOU REACH UP AND YOU GRAB
ONTO THE SUPER ROD.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.496
AND YOU TWIST AND YOU TWIST

30:30.529 --> 30:31.297
AND YOU TWIST.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.033
IT STRENGTHENS
YOUR ENTIRE CORE.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.335
YOUR BACK CORE,

30:36.368 --> 30:38.237
YOUR ARM CORE,

30:38.270 --> 30:41.607
YOUR--THE MARINE CORPS
ACTUALLY USES IT.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.043
I THINK THAT'S HOW
THEY GOT "CORPS."

30:49.081 --> 30:51.951
(Andy)
I LEFT A LITTLE PRESENT
FOR ANGELA.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.953
I THINK SHE'S GOING
TO LIKE IT

30:53.986 --> 30:57.523
'CAUSE I FOUND IT OUTSIDE
VANCE REFRIGERATION ALL ALONE.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.624
AND I TOLD HER IN THE NOTE

30:58.657 --> 31:01.493
THAT THE CAT CAME TO FIND HER.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.496
THAT THEY WERE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.601
I GOT GAME.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.943
(Oscar)
THE GREEN BAR IS WHAT YOU SPEND
EVERY MONTH

31:16.976 --> 31:18.044
ON STUFF YOU NEED.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.379
LIKE A CAR AND A HOUSE.

31:20.412 --> 31:24.616
THAT IS SO COOL
HOW YOU HAVE MY NAME AT THE TOP.

31:24.650 --> 31:29.255
THE RED BAR IS WHAT YOU SPEND
ON NON-ESSENTIALS,

31:29.288 --> 31:31.557
LIKE MAGAZINES, ENTERTAINMENT,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

31:31.590 --> 31:36.462
THIS SCARY BLACK BAR
IS WHAT YOU SPEND

31:36.495 --> 31:39.498
ON THINGS THAT NO ONE
EVER, EVER NEEDS,

31:39.531 --> 31:41.300
LIKE MULTIPLE MAGIC SETS,

31:41.333 --> 31:42.601
PROFESSIONAL BASS FISHING
EQUIPMENT.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.003
HOW DID YOU DO THIS
SO FAST?

31:44.036 --> 31:45.972
IS THIS POWERPOINT?

31:46.005 --> 31:48.975
[playing somber song]

31:49.008 --> 31:54.947
*

31:54.981 --> 31:56.515
OH, MAN.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.087
ANGELA REALLY HAD
A HOLD ON HIM.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.289
ANGELA.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.623
MICHAEL, I'M GONNA SET
YOU AND JAN UP

32:04.656 --> 32:06.192
WITH A DEBT CONSOLIDATOR.
NO.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.093
YOU MEET WITH THIS GUY--
NO.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.395
WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE JAN
OUT OF THIS.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.297
SHE HAS TO KNOW.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.598
WE WILL FIND ANOTHER WAY.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.666
WE'LL ASK POWERPOINT.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.003
MICHAEL, THIS IS A PRESENTATION
TOOL.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.670
YOU'RE A PRESENTATION TOOL...

32:18.704 --> 32:20.139
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
TELL JAN ABOUT THIS.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.173
I'M DONE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.274
OKAY, JUST...

32:22.308 --> 32:23.442
YOU'RE NOT A TOOL.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.011
LOOK, WE'LL TELL HER
THAT IT'S BAD.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.646
BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN
A LOT WORSE

32:27.679 --> 32:30.649
BUT DUE TO SOME FANCY
FINANCIAL FOOTWORK

32:30.682 --> 32:34.020
I WAS ABLE TO CUT IT
IN HALF.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.487
JAN IS SMART.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.456
SHE POSES.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.028
DWIGHT,
HOW'S THE HOTEL BUSINESS?

32:42.061 --> 32:45.031
STUPID.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.033
HAVE YOU CHECKED
TRIP ADVISOR RECENTLY?

32:47.066 --> 32:49.168
NO.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.670
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.006
MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

32:54.040 --> 32:56.575
WHATEVER.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.778
(Pam)
WE WROTE A GOOD REVIEW.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.014
UNDER COMMENTS,
WE WROTE:

33:02.048 --> 33:03.615
"THE NATURAL AROMA
OF THE BEETS

33:03.649 --> 33:04.516
"DRIFTS INTO THE BEDROOMS

33:04.550 --> 33:07.086
AND MAKES YOU DREAM
OF SIMPLER TIMES."

33:07.119 --> 33:08.154
(Jim)
"THE DAWN GOOSE WALK

33:08.187 --> 33:10.622
"WILL TUG AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS."

33:10.656 --> 33:13.525
(Pam)
"TABLE-MAKING NEVER SEEMED
SO POSSIBLE."

33:13.559 --> 33:17.029
(Jim)
"YOU WILL NEVER
WANT TO LEAVE YOUR ROOM."

33:17.063 --> 33:18.530
(Pam)
"THE ARCHITECTURE REMINDS ONE

33:18.564 --> 33:20.499
OF A QUAINT TUSCAN
BEET FARM."

33:25.304 --> 33:26.772
I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED YOUR STAY.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.775
WE REALLY DID.
IT WAS FUN.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.512
[sighs]

33:34.713 --> 33:39.485
SO DUE TO MICHAEL'S
CLEVER FINANCIAL MANEUVERING,

33:39.518 --> 33:43.155
HE FINDS HIMSELF
TREMENDOUSLY IN DEBT.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.690
[Jan on speaker]
YOU'RE BROKE?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.625
HOW--UH, THAT'S--

33:46.658 --> 33:48.260
HOW DID YOU GET THAT
FROM WHAT OSCAR'S SAYING?

33:48.294 --> 33:49.628
THAT'S NOT--

33:49.661 --> 33:51.230
(Pam)
I MEAN MICHAEL,
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.598
WHERE EXACTLY
DID YOUR MONEY GO?

33:52.631 --> 33:55.601
I--I DON'T--

33:55.634 --> 33:56.768
I DON'T GET THIS.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.537
I REALLY DON'T.
I DON'T--

33:58.570 --> 34:01.140
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

34:01.173 --> 34:03.609
YOU COULD BE SO...

34:03.642 --> 34:05.077
IRRESPONSIBLE.

34:05.111 --> 34:08.114
I MEAN, UGH.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.416
THIS IS ASTOUNDING TO ME,
REALLY.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.850
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MORE TO SAY.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.419
JAN.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.420
YEAH, WHAT?

34:14.453 --> 34:16.522
MICHAEL LEFT.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.224
OKAY, WHERE DID HE GO?

34:18.257 --> 34:20.392
I DON'T KNOW.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.662
WELL IS HE COMING
RIGHT BACK?

34:23.695 --> 34:25.831
(Oscar)
I DON'T THINK SO.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.066
[Jan sighs]
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.686
(Michael)
WHAT AM I DOING?

34:47.719 --> 34:50.822
I'M BLOWING DODGE.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.658
I'M GETTING OUT OF TOWN.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.160
UGH--OOH.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.161
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.496
I AM RUNNING AWAY
FROM MY RESPONSIBILITIES.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.366
AND IT FEELS GOOD.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.638
YOU MAY ASK ME OUT TO DINNER.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.442
NOTHING FANCY OR FOREIGN.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.544
NO BARS, NO PATIOS,
NO VEGETABLES.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.546
AND NO SEAFOOD.

35:21.687 --> 35:22.888
DWIGHT.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.525
[door shuts]

35:29.461 --> 35:32.364
[moaning]

35:46.578 --> 35:49.948
DID I EVER TELL YOU
WHY I LEFT SCRANTON?

35:49.981 --> 35:52.518
[groaning]

35:52.551 --> 35:54.453
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK
I HAD.

35:54.486 --> 35:59.225
WELL IT WAS ALL ABOUT PAM.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.260
[mumbling]

36:01.293 --> 36:04.596
YEAH, I MEAN,
SHE WAS WITH ROY.

36:04.630 --> 36:09.768
AND, UH, I JUST
COULDN'T TAKE IT.

36:09.801 --> 36:13.272
I MEAN, I LOST IT,
DWIGHT.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.442
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

36:16.475 --> 36:19.478
I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE
ON ANYTHING.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.415
AND THEN WEIRD STUFF,
LIKE,

36:23.449 --> 36:27.519
FOOD HAD NO TASTE.

36:27.553 --> 36:32.258
SO MY SOLUTION WAS
TO MOVE AWAY.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.394
IT WAS AWFUL.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.264
AND IT IS SOMETHING
THAT I WOULD WISH

36:38.297 --> 36:40.232
ON MY WORST ENEMY.

36:43.502 --> 36:46.305
AND THAT INCLUDES YOU.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.941
HEY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
DINNER--

37:28.547 --> 37:30.349
UH, DINNER.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.750
LET'S SEE, MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY

37:31.783 --> 37:33.485
THE, UM...NEW ITALIAN PLACE

37:33.519 --> 37:34.586
WHERE THE DRY CLEANER
USED TO BE.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.587
OKAY.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.356
YEAH?
YEAH.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.958
OKAY.

37:39.991 --> 37:45.431
JIM'S JUST REALLY PASSIONATE
ABOUT ITALIAN FOOD.

37:45.464 --> 37:51.437
YEP, I'M VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT ITALIAN FOOD.

37:51.470 --> 37:56.842
IN FACT, UM,
I'M IN LOVE WITH ITALIAN FOOD.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.617
JAN, HE WENT RUNNING THAT WAY--

38:05.651 --> 38:07.886
OKAY, GREAT.
THANKS.

[singing quietly]
* RUNAWAY TRAIN

38:12.624 --> 38:14.926
* NEVER COMING BACK

38:14.960 --> 38:19.030
* RUNAWAY AND I'M
NEVER COMING BACK *

38:19.064 --> 38:20.466
MICHAEL.

38:20.499 --> 38:24.403
HEY, JAN.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.072
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:27.105 --> 38:29.541
NOT MUCH.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.676
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

38:30.709 --> 38:31.743
WELL WHY ARE YOU
SITTING ON A TRAIN?

38:31.777 --> 38:32.744
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

38:32.778 --> 38:33.845
I'M OUT OF ANSWERS, JAN.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.081
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:36.114 --> 38:38.684
I TOLD YOU,
NO MORE ANSWERS.

38:38.717 --> 38:42.954
THIS IS WHO I AM NOW.

38:42.988 --> 38:46.091
A GUY ON A TRAIN
WITH NO ANSWERS.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.394
I HOPE THAT CAN BE ENOUGH
FOR YOU.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.496
MICHAEL, COME ON.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.564
RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS
WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.532
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.866
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.035
YOUR CREDITORS CAN FOLLOW YOU
ANYWHERE WITH EASE.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.004
YOUR DEBT FOLLOWS YOU
AROUND THE WORLD.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.071
ELECTRONICALLY.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.106
I'LL STAY OFF THE GRID.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.008
OH, MICHAEL,
COME ON.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.710
COME ON, YOU CAN DEAL
WITH THIS.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.545
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

39:06.578 --> 39:10.148
YEAH, IT IS.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.150
IT IS.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.653
I REALLY MESSED UP.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.156
WELL...

39:18.189 --> 39:21.593
WHEN--WHEN MY LIFE
FELL APART

39:21.627 --> 39:23.495
AND THEY--AND THEY SCREWED ME
IN NEW YORK

39:23.529 --> 39:25.764
AND I FELT LIKE MY WHOLE WORLD
WAS COLLAPSING AROUND ME

39:25.797 --> 39:27.399
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.668
I MEAN, MY WHOLE FAMILY STILL
WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME

39:29.701 --> 39:31.036
ON THE ADVICE OF COUNCIL

39:31.069 --> 39:33.004
AND MY FRIENDS WERE JUST WAITING

39:33.038 --> 39:34.105
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.408
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO SAY.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.843
MICHAEL, NO,
WHAT I WANT TO SAY

39:37.876 --> 39:41.146
IS YOU WERE THERE FOR ME.

39:41.179 --> 39:44.015
BY MY SIDE.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.886
WITHOUT EVEN A THOUGHT.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.489
THAT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE.

39:55.961 --> 39:59.565
NO MATTER HOW BADLY
I TREAT YOU

39:59.598 --> 40:01.700
OR WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH,

40:01.733 --> 40:03.869
YOU JUST--
YOU ARE THERE FOR ME.

40:03.902 --> 40:08.039
AND THAT IS A GUY
WORTH STAYING BESIDE.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.844
SO WHERE'S THIS TRAIN
TAKING US?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.451
I DON'T--

40:19.485 --> 40:22.688
I THINK THE ENGINEER LEFT.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.154
HELLO, THIS IS DWIGHT SCHRUTE
CALLING FROM DUNDER MIFFLIN,

40:56.187 --> 40:57.055
AND ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS,

40:57.088 --> 41:00.526
YOU APPEAR TO BE LOW
ON OFFICE SUPPLIES.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.561
(Dwight)
OKAY, SURE, I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THAT RIGHT NOW

41:05.296 --> 41:07.132
DON'T SELL YOUR IMPLANTS,
PLEASE.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.801
I'M KEEPING THEM.
I KNOW YOU LIKE THEM.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.239
THEY'RE KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE
THOUGH.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.707
IT'S NICE THOUGH.
LOOKS CUTE.

41:15.741 --> 41:19.110
KIND OF PAINFUL AND MY NIPPLES
AREN'T AS SENSITIVE NOW.
LOOKS CUTE THOUGH.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.981
