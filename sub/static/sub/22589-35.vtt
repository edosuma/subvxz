00:10.053 --> 00:15.642
<i>NARRATOR". Gotham City, like any other
large metropolis, abounds in the quaint shop...</i>

00:15.850 --> 00:17.602
<i>...the unique store.</i>

00:17.810 --> 00:23.691
<i>And what could be a more bizarre emporium
than Bon Ben's Box Boutique?</i>

00:23.900 --> 00:27.487
<i>Open early on this sunny morning...</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:33.159
<i>...almost as if awaiting
some equally bizarre customers.</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:37.288
Well, good morning, gentlemen.

00:37.497 --> 00:40.833
Something in empty boxes today?

00:41.042 --> 00:43.503
We're looking for some empty hat boxes.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.880
A lot of empty hat boxes.

00:46.089 --> 00:49.050
Well, you've really come to the right place.

00:49.259 --> 00:54.847
I have a collection of empty hat boxes
unparalleled in all of Gotham City.

00:55.056 --> 00:58.101
Good, 700 of these would be fine.

00:59.143 --> 01:02.146
- Do you want them delivered?
-We'll take them with us.

01:02.355 --> 01:04.691
Seven hundred hat boxes?

01:05.108 --> 01:06.442
There are three of us.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.945
Cash or charge?

01:09.153 --> 01:11.072
That is of no concern to me, madam...

01:11.281 --> 01:15.243
...as I don't intend to pay for them
in either case.

01:16.786 --> 01:18.037
Oh.

01:23.418 --> 01:27.839
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile behind
the boxwood hedges and boxing shutters...</i>

01:28.047 --> 01:30.341
<i>...of stately Wayne Manor...</i>

01:30.550 --> 01:32.552
And so, Professor Overbeck...

01:32.760 --> 01:35.763
...as head of the Wayne Foundation,
it gives me great pleasure...

01:35.972 --> 01:37.890
...to present to you this check...

01:38.099 --> 01:41.352
...which, in some small way,
may help you with your fine work...

01:41.561 --> 01:45.064
...at the Gotham City
Atomic Energy Laboratories.

01:45.273 --> 01:51.654
Oh! Mr. Wayne, it gives me great pleasure
to accept this. Heh.

01:52.864 --> 01:54.866
The Batphone, sir.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.994
- Thank you, Alfred. I may need your help, Dick.
-Sure, Bruce.

01:58.202 --> 02:01.247
Now, if you'll excuse me, professor,
I have some other matters...

02:01.456 --> 02:03.583
...connected with the foundation.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.001
But of course, Mr. Wayne.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.629
It will give me a moment
with this charming lady...

02:07.837 --> 02:10.340
...to thank her for the delightful luncheon.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.925
You know, you know, Mrs. Cooper,
I really mean it.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.887
You have a certain way with a strudel.

02:16.095 --> 02:20.224
Stole 700 hat boxes
from Bon Bon's Box Boutique?

02:20.433 --> 02:23.311
There's little doubt
about the culprit's identity, Batman.

02:23.519 --> 02:27.565
Warden Crichton tells me the convicts
were enjoying a softball game last week...

02:27.774 --> 02:31.736
...and the Mad Hatter stole home and kept
right on going in Warden Crichton's cap.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.529
The warden was acting as umpire.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.823
Keep calm, commissioner.
We'll be right there.

02:36.032 --> 02:37.825
To the Batpoles.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.471 --> 03:41.848
Atomic batteries to power.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.099
Turbines to speed.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.476
Roger. Ready to move out.

04:22.305 --> 04:26.225
So I'd say it's following
the old familiar pattern of the Mad Hatter.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.978
- But he hasn't stolen any hats.
-One hat, Robin.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.606
Or rather a cap
belonging to Warden Crichton...

04:31.814 --> 04:34.025
...along with home plate at the penitentiary.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.987
Which they found between the prison's
baseball diamond and the tennis courts.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.447
Sometimes I wonder...

04:39.655 --> 04:42.950
...if the warden's rehabilitation program
isn't getting out of hand.

04:43.493 --> 04:46.037
And of course
there were the 700 hat boxes...

04:46.245 --> 04:49.373
...along with the attack
on the proprietress of the Box Boutique.

04:49.582 --> 04:52.293
Sure, and that all adds up
to at least a little larceny.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.129
That adds up to serious trouble,
Chief O'Hara.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.048
Who knows what disaster lies ahead...

04:57.256 --> 05:01.636
...when a man of the Mad Hatter's
twisted tendencies is loose in Gotham City?

05:01.844 --> 05:05.264
And who knows what lies in store
for you, Batman?

05:05.473 --> 05:10.228
He'd stop at nothing to add that cowl
to his horrific hoard of headpieces.

05:10.436 --> 05:13.439
The loss of my cowl is secondary,
commissioner.

05:13.648 --> 05:15.858
But not the fate of Gotham City.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.319
Right.
This monster must be stopped at once.

05:18.528 --> 05:21.572
Where will we begin, Batman?
The prison ballpark or the box shops?

05:21.906 --> 05:25.535
That's all after the fact, Robin.
We must anticipate his next move.

05:25.743 --> 05:29.747
And I believe the Batcave is the place for that.
Excuse us, please.

05:33.751 --> 05:37.463
Looking back, Chief O'Hara,
it's hard to remember how we operated at all...

05:37.672 --> 05:41.551
...before those two masked Samaritans
appeared on the scene.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.303
It's not hard for me to remember,
commissioner.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.847
Things were a mess.

05:47.431 --> 05:52.478
<i>NARRATOR". Masked Samaritans or not,
it looks like things may get even messier...</i>

05:52.687 --> 05:56.649
<i>...judging by what's going on
in the Mad Hatter's current hideaway...</i>

05:56.858 --> 05:59.819
<i>...in the defunct Green Derby Restaurant.</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:06.534
It's like losing old friends, Polly,
putting these hats away.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.871
Take this shako, for instance. Ho-ho!

06:10.079 --> 06:14.375
How startled the guardsman was
when I lifted it...

06:14.584 --> 06:17.962
...during a time
when he was trooping the royal colors.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.131
Wasn't that risky, Jervis?

06:20.339 --> 06:21.716
A bit touch-and-go.

06:21.924 --> 06:25.094
Especially when the king
ordered my execution.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.263
But I escaped.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.682
With this noose.

06:29.891 --> 06:34.437
Hardly a hat,
but in its way, a kind of headwear.

06:36.606 --> 06:40.067
Aha. And the sultan of Shargreve...

06:40.276 --> 06:45.156
...how startled he was when I lifted this
during a tiger hunt.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.950
You certainly were asking for trouble
that time, Jervis.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.827
A soupgon.

06:50.036 --> 06:53.956
What puzzles me, Jervis,
is why you're packing all this heisted headgear.

06:54.165 --> 06:57.710
Times change, Polly, and people with them.

06:57.919 --> 07:01.088
Stealing hats has lost its fascination for me.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.174
You mean you're going straight?

07:03.382 --> 07:06.260
Hardly. Do you think I've blown my lid?

07:06.469 --> 07:08.679
This phase in my career will never be over...

07:08.888 --> 07:13.476
...until the Caped Crusader's cowl
is safely in my custody.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.811
Oh, gee, Jervis.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.730
You had me worried for a minute.

07:17.939 --> 07:20.858
I mean, a hat-check girl
without any hats to check is...

07:21.067 --> 07:26.072
And after that I'm going to change my tactics
and use hats to steal.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.449
Hats to steal?

07:28.908 --> 07:30.159
I'm puzzled again.

07:30.368 --> 07:34.580
Well, it's a plan which is better understood
as it unfolds, Polly...

07:34.789 --> 07:37.333
...involving as it does
the Headdress Ball tonight...

07:37.541 --> 07:41.879
...at which you will be in charge
of the hat-check stand...

07:42.088 --> 07:45.591
...plus the Three-Tailed Pasha
of Panchagorum...

07:46.175 --> 07:51.931
...plus this plastic gun
filled with radioactive spray...

07:52.723 --> 07:58.437
...plus the Golden Buddha of Bergama
and the priceless ruby in its forehead...

07:58.646 --> 08:00.439
...and finally...

08:00.648 --> 08:04.568
...plus that elevated water tank
at the rear of this property.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.781
Down the ladder of which Benny and Skimmer
are now climbing.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.617
What on earth are they doing
in the water tank?

08:11.826 --> 08:16.080
Preparing a watery grave,
elevated of course...

08:16.288 --> 08:18.874
...for the Caped Crusader.

08:19.333 --> 08:24.714
If I don't think of a trickier means
of disposing of Batman first.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.387
"Sombrero.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.179
Sunbonnet

08:33.389 --> 08:35.057
Pith helmet.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.434
Tam-0'-shanter.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.311
Skullcap.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.022
Snood."

08:41.230 --> 08:44.358
I don't see how we'll anticipate
Mad Hatter's next malicious move...

08:44.567 --> 08:47.862
...just by getting a lot of cards
from a Batcomputer, Batman.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.865
You're right, Robin.
No doubt even that mechanical marvel...

08:51.073 --> 08:54.452
...feels the stress and strain
of crime-fighting...

08:54.660 --> 08:59.373
...and has chosen this particular moment
to letdown.

08:59.582 --> 09:04.795
Perhaps if I activated
the Accelerated Concentration Switch.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.894
Holy handiwork, Batman.
A new attack entirely.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.187
"The Top Hat Room.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.646
The Headdress Ball.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.356
Hattie Hatfield."

09:24.565 --> 09:28.027
Of course. I should have made
the connection myself, Robin.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.572
Perhaps I, too, have become remiss.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.949
Well, what is the connection?

09:34.158 --> 09:39.538
Gotham City's Annual Charity Headdress Ball
is being held tonight...

09:39.747 --> 09:43.125
...at the Gotham Towers West
in the Top Hat Room.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.836
And Hattie Hatfield...

09:46.045 --> 09:50.883
...uh, Gotham City's current grande dame
of local society...

09:51.092 --> 09:53.511
...is the head of the event.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.055
Isn't she the owner
of the famous Hatfield ruby?

09:56.263 --> 10:00.810
Right, Robin. And as I recall reading
in the morning's gossip column...

10:01.018 --> 10:07.983
...the magnificent headdress worn tonight
by Ms. Hatfield will be held in place...

10:08.192 --> 10:09.777
...by that ruby.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.071
Oh, that should draw Mad Hatter
like a magnet.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.322
No doubt, old chum.

10:13.531 --> 10:16.826
So as we have one
of our infrequent free afternoons...

10:17.034 --> 10:21.288
...I think we should run a check
on our Batarangs and our Bat-ropes.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.499
We did that right after our last Bat-climb.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.961
Forewarned, forearmed, Robin.

10:27.169 --> 10:33.801
All the walls of the Gotham Towers West
are sheer glass.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.893
<i>NARRATOR". But even as the Headdress Ball
gets underway...</i>

10:43.102 --> 10:46.564
<i>...what surprising news
is this hotel manager receiving...</i>

10:46.772 --> 10:49.525
<i>...in the foyer of the Top Hat Room?</i>

10:49.733 --> 10:53.237
The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum?

10:53.445 --> 10:57.241
Yes, he's in Gotham City incognito.

10:57.449 --> 11:02.580
And he's asked me, as First Secretary
of the Panchagorum Consulate...

11:02.788 --> 11:08.085
...to tell you that he'd love to drop in
on the Headdress Ball for a few moments.

11:08.294 --> 11:10.296
Incognito, of course.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.176
<i>To observe the folkways
and native customs.</i>

11:15.384 --> 11:17.303
But he's a very simple man...

11:17.511 --> 11:21.891
...and he trusts that there will be no burden
on hotel security.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.977
Oh, no, no. Assure him, sir, that it will not.

11:25.186 --> 11:30.274
No, for the Three-Tailed Pasha,
we shall be most unobtrusive. Heh.

11:35.112 --> 11:38.115
<i>EXCUSE TUE, EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me.</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:42.244
I think I'd better alert you, honey.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.456
The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum
is about to drop in...

11:45.664 --> 11:47.666
...on this little affair any minute.

11:47.875 --> 11:52.046
Oh? Then I'll give him
a three-tailed hat check.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.384
He doesn't want word to get out,
but I'd better tell Hattie Hatfield.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.642
- I hear Jervis is on his way up.
-Right.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.061
Is, uh, everything set?

12:07.269 --> 12:10.814
Skimmer and the rest of the boys
are at their stations.

12:19.448 --> 12:23.535
The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum?

12:23.744 --> 12:26.413
Did you hear that, Mabel?

12:26.622 --> 12:29.291
<i>NARRATOR".
But while the pasha ascends by elevator...</i>

12:29.500 --> 12:35.130
<i>...the dynamic duo make a less orthodox
approach up the sheer glass wall.</i>

12:35.339 --> 12:38.509
Looked like a fancy affair
down on the 62nd floor, Batman.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.763
Just goes to show, Robin, that people who stay
in glass hotels shouldn't throw parties.

12:42.972 --> 12:47.351
Eyes front.
After all, we're not social climbers.

12:48.143 --> 12:51.272
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile back at the classy clambake...</i>

12:51.480 --> 12:53.983
Care to check your three-tailed hat, sir?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.193
I never leave my hat with anyone.

12:56.402 --> 12:58.445
My three-horsetailed tassels...

12:58.654 --> 13:02.408
...are a symbol of my high rank
as a Panchagorum military commander.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.159
Then perhaps your gloves.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.995
Nor my gloves, either.

13:06.203 --> 13:10.708
In this one, I have my reliable ruby retriever.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.876
But, uh, what a unique custom.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.130
Leaving articles of clothing
with a pretty young lady at the door.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.467
I must initiate that
in my Panchagorum harems.

13:34.148 --> 13:37.901
I'm Hattie Hatfield,
Your Three-Tailed Excellency.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.278
Then word has gotten out.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.239
I really wanted this little visit
to be incognito.

13:42.448 --> 13:45.326
- Who's that?
-Mad Hatter, Robin. Who else?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.328
Why three horsetails on his fez?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.706
Obviously a ruse of some kind.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.459
Let's slip in and find a better vantage point.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.379
I'm sure we'll be unnoticed.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.559
In Panchagorum I travel unnoticed,
and prefer it that way.

14:10.768 --> 14:13.812
Such a humble man.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.565
Oh, I love your hat.

14:17.107 --> 14:21.111
What a unique place to wear your three tails.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.614
- A concession to the changing times.
-Heh.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.408
The buffet?

14:28.577 --> 14:30.954
Some champagne
for His Three-Tailed Pasha.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.956
And some caviar.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.210
He's so charming. He's so democratic.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.879
Batman and Robin
are hiding behind the table.

14:39.088 --> 14:40.589
Yeah, ready for action.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.466
And they'll get it.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.717
No, thank you.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.179
You mean I can't interest you in anything?

14:47.388 --> 14:49.723
Oh, I didn't say that, dear lady.

14:49.932 --> 14:54.686
That headdress of yours is very interesting.
Particularly that beautiful ruby.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.899
- On your mark.
-Compared to it...

14:59.108 --> 15:03.529
...the famous stones of Panchagorum
are faded and lifeless.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.447
But it's really nothing.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.366
It's a family heirloom.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.992
Get set.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.494
But what brilliance.

15:10.828 --> 15:11.954
Go.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.040
Batman and Robin.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.917
What are you doing here?

15:17.126 --> 15:20.045
The Three-Tailed Pasha
is an imposter, Ms. Hatfield.

15:20.254 --> 15:24.633
If you'll check your headdress,
you'll see that your ruby is gone.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.552
It's gone.

15:27.136 --> 15:28.220
Back, citizens.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.500
And now you, Mad Hatter.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.879
Not until I toss my hat into the ring, Batman.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.550
Holy fireworks!

16:51.553 --> 16:53.263
Look out, Batman, knock-out gas.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.016
No, Boy Wonder,
something much more effective.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.310
Radioactive spray.

16:58.519 --> 17:01.522
Try this on your cowl for size.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.193
You diabolical devil.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.864
Not one step forward, Boy Wonder,
or you'll get it too.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.657
Don't take that step, Robin.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.165
Why, you three-tailed--

17:28.757 --> 17:31.134
Your cowl, Batman. It's turned bright pink.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.512
A form of virulent radiation, Robin.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.890
Quickly. Back to the Batcave
before it is too late.

17:57.244 --> 18:01.039
Sir, all your other cowls
are in the Home Dry Bat-cleaning Plant.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.833
It's turned up to full-maximum.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.837
But even so, I'm afraid they won't be ready
for another couple of hours at least.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.338
Holy self-service.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.133
What about the new cowls
you've been working on, Alfred?

18:11.341 --> 18:15.220
The material I ordered hasn't arrived yet.
A trend of the times, I'm afraid, sir.

18:15.429 --> 18:16.597
We've gotta do something.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.891
I know a little about radioactivity
and its effect on human tissue.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.269
If you're worrying about me, Robin, don't.

18:22.477 --> 18:28.025
The Anti Radioactive Bat-pill that I took
should hold me for a short while longer.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.069
Of greater importance
is getting a usable cowl...

18:31.278 --> 18:33.697
...and to use it in apprehending Mad Hatter.

18:34.323 --> 18:38.702
Alfred, turn the Home Dry Bat-cleaning Plant
from full-maximum to super-instant...

18:38.910 --> 18:41.496
...while millionaire Bruce Wayne
makes a telephone call.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.582
- Very good, sir.
-Bruce Wayne?

18:43.790 --> 18:48.754
Yes, to Professor Overbeck of the Gotham City
Atomic Energy Laboratories.

18:49.379 --> 18:54.968
This morning Mr. Wayne presented
Professor Overbeck with a sizable check...

18:55.177 --> 18:56.511
...for his fine work.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.641
Perhaps the good professor
would like to return the favor...

19:00.849 --> 19:05.687
...by doing something
for Mr. Wayne's friend, Batman.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.575
Yes, Mr. Batman, Mr. Wayne did call.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.495
And I'll be glad to help you in any way I can.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.996
But that cowl.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.123
<i>Ach du lieber, that cowl.</i>

19:25.540 --> 19:30.462
You know, I'm not sure that our most advanced
decontaminating processes will be of help.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.589
However, we will try.

19:32.798 --> 19:36.093
I'll have my assistant bring you
a hooded protective suit at once...

19:36.301 --> 19:38.804
...while you are waiting here.
Just one moment, please.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.851
On your toes, Robin.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.105
The night has eyes and ears.

19:49.106 --> 19:52.275
Gosh, Batman, that one stumps me.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.821
I didn't have time to explain it
on the outside...

19:56.029 --> 19:58.949
...but we were followed here
at least part of the way.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.784
Mad Hatter?

20:00.992 --> 20:04.496
No doubt anticipating our every move.

20:04.705 --> 20:07.791
And what better place to retrieve my cowl...

20:07.999 --> 20:11.795
...than somewhere I voluntarily remove it.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.841
He may be in for a little surprise.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.467
Otto.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.010
Otto.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.429
Otto.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.722
Yes, professor?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.974
<i>Where have you been, Otto?</i>

20:24.182 --> 20:27.436
<i>Look, when I call I expect an answer.</i>

20:27.644 --> 20:30.063
I'm answering, professor. I'm answering.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.316
Now, look, Otto,
I have here Herr Batman with me...

20:33.525 --> 20:37.112
...in <i>a radioactive cowl
which has to be decontaminated.</i>

20:37.320 --> 20:41.575
<i>Now, will you please bring me
one hooded protective suit at once.</i>

20:41.783 --> 20:44.369
Yes, professor, yes.

20:48.832 --> 20:53.211
Give me a hand with that hooded
protective suit, and then find me another.

20:54.504 --> 20:59.926
So little is known about this radioactivity
of radioactive agents.

21:00.135 --> 21:05.599
So little is known that we only know one thing,
that eventually they are deadly.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.435
Gosh, Batman.
I hope that pill is still working.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.520
The effects are beginning to wear off faintly.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.690
Ah, here he is.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.694
Thank you. Thank you.

21:17.903 --> 21:21.740
Now, Herr Batman, will you please slip out
of your cowl and get into this?

21:21.948 --> 21:25.535
Yes, and, oh, I remember,
you don't want to reveal your identity...

21:25.744 --> 21:29.289
...so use this, will you, please.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.417
- Need any help, Batman?
-No, Robin.

21:32.626 --> 21:37.005
Just remember, eyes and ears.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.219
So your name's Otto.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.430
Oh, excuse me, Wonder Boy.

21:45.639 --> 21:47.098
I should have introduced you.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.769
Yes, this is Otto. Otto Puffendorfer.

21:50.977 --> 21:55.023
You see, he's my reliable assistant
ever since I had a little laboratory...

21:55.232 --> 21:58.151
...way back in the old country.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.823
- Here you are, professor.
- Yeah, yes-- Oh, no, no.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.616
No?

22:04.825 --> 22:09.746
Ah. Otto, Otto, take this out
and have it decontaminated.

22:09.955 --> 22:13.667
- Just a minute, Otto Puffendorfer.
-Unhand me, Boy Birdbrain.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.044
- Oh!
-Now I have what I've always wanted.

22:18.088 --> 22:20.048
That wasn't Otto.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.967
- No, it was Mad Hatter.
-Aah!

22:26.847 --> 22:28.056
Herr Batman.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.226
- How could you have two cowls?
<i>- I'll</i> explain later, professor.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.521
- Is there another door into that room?
-Down the hall.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.985
I have Batman's cowl.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.321
The crowning achievement of my career.
The end of his.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.032
And the end of crime-fighting
in Gotham City, boss.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.159
Oh, such sweet victory.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.036
Don't count us out yet, gentlemen.

22:50.829 --> 22:55.292
Victory and defeat
are of the same price, Mad Hatter.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.378
It's some kind of a trick.
That can't be Batman.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.631
As well as you can be
the Three-tailed Pasha of Panchagorum.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.801
And Professor Overbeck's assistant,
Mad Hatter?

23:05.010 --> 23:07.262
<i>- I'll</i> take that cowl.
- That cowl's contaminated.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.848
Sic them! Sic them! Sic them!

23:17.022 --> 23:18.398
Herr Batman, Herr Batman.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.401
Robin is trapped in a fluoroscopic cabinet.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.112
It's a high-voltage x-ray.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.451
Oh, Herr Bat-- Aah!

23:41.463 --> 23:44.215
Otto. Otto. Somebody.

23:44.424 --> 23:49.930
Mr. Fancy-Hatter, they'll be x-rayed forever.
They'll be radiated in a matter of minutes.

23:50.138 --> 23:53.141
Don't worry, my friend.
You don't need to watch.

23:57.062 --> 24:00.815
Happy tin-types, dynamic duo.
